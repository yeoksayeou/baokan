<h3>荷比形勢又緊張</h3>
<p>第二次歐戰爆發到現在，將及五個月，而雙方主力還保持着盤馬彎弓的姿態，沒有作短兵相接的厮殺。在英法，這次是軍事資源的消耗戰，根據「穩紮穩打」原則，除加緊封鎖行動外，自無取於一拼。獨向以「速戰速決」爲取勝捷徑的德國，竟亦徘徊觀望，不敢輕於發動攻勢，則甚値得注意。原來，這次德國明知是勁敵當前，不敢冒險，所以正在考慮於二途之間：今後是否應該繼續和蘇聯携手，同時向巴爾幹發展，以期獲得該兩方豐富的資源接濟，和英法作長時期的周旋呢？抑或先行佔領荷比，作爲就近打擊英法的根據地，使戰事比較易於了結呢？急攻緩守，方針不同，取舍之間，自須鄭重，所以歷次風傳德軍行將進攻荷比，與其說是她虛張聲勢，煽惑人心，不如說她在勘探情勢，見機而作。</p>
<p>最近數日歐洲各處盛傳，因荷蘭氣候嚴寒，「水防」計劃，效力大减，德國軍事當局認爲有機可乘，又擬將去年十一月間所決定的進攻戰略，從新付諸實施。又傳荷此兩國皆在緊急動員，形勢緊張，達於極點云云。原來德國對於荷比，雖屬顧慮孔多，然從去年十一月以迄現在，所以躍躍欲試者，依我們觀察，其中大概有如下列幾種因素：第一，德國自陳兵於荷比邊境以來，形勢雖時緊時弛，而軍隊則迄未撤退；因爲荷蘭確是進攻英法的絕好根據地，倘若佔據荷蘭東部後，進攻英倫三島，距離大爲縮短，運輸給養力面，亦遠較便利；且越荷攻比，但窺馬奇諾防綫的弱點，更可予法國以極大威脅。所以此項計劃，始終未嘗放棄。第二，冬令天寒地凍，荷蘭河面結冰甚厚，士兵與汽車可以通行無阻，行軍遠較其他季節爲便利。第三，蘇聯困於對芬蘭戰事，而德蘇間經濟與技術談判，一時未有眉目，德國對蘇聯及巴爾幹的接濟，可望而不可即，「速戰速決」說因此又形抬頭，國社黨幹部主張尤力，雖參謀部反對投機冒險，但已不一定能諫阻希特勒。第四，非在短時間內有驚人事件發生，不能予國內民衆以新的刺激，振作其作戰精神。</p>
<p>假定德國進攻荷比之舉，果爾實現，其影響所及，自極堪注目。其間最重要者，第一，我們曾經指出，荷比兩國果眞捲入戰爭漩渦，事實上就等於西綫大戰的發作，歐洲戰局從此就要轉入另一階段，所以荷比問題實在是歐洲戰局目前關鍵所在。第一，早在去年十一月間，義大利與西班牙兩國曾以正常的外交途徑，通知德政府，聲明他們對於荷比的領土完整爲人尊重一事，極爲關切。以前又曾傳聞，德國向此利時秘密動員消息，最初係由義大利方面暗中通知比力。義王太子妃即係比國公主云云。又據合衆社十六日巴黎電稱，最近德國開往荷蘭邊境的機械化部隊，多爲自波蘭方面調回者，此種動作，足見蘇德兩國現已完全沆瀣一氣，將對西歐東歐採行共同行動等語。原來德義之間，有其矛盾，一因中歐與巴爾幹力面的利害衝突，二因對於穌聯恩怨友敵的逈不相侔；然軸心的若存若廢，國交的若即若離，到現在爲止，噯眛至於極點；一旦德國對荷比戰事爆發，則義大利態度必不復能保持其兩可之中立，而不得不以明朗之態度與世以共見。第三，斯坎的那維亞半島各國（即瑞典挪威丹麥）以及荷比芬蘭等嘗有奧斯陸公的的訂結。此的雖非攻守同盟，亦無軍事意味，惟各締的國皆傾心和平，又因地理人種及歷史政治各種聯繫，故感情特別融洽。大體利害，無不相共。自蘇芬戰起，瑞挪丹各國入民已紛紛對芬表示同情，荷比若亦在被侵略者之列，行見各該國問將益抱脣亡齒寒之感；何况英法迭有宣言，所有被德侵略的國家，皆在其援助之列，而其對芬同情，亦極爲露骨。故德軍侵入荷比之日，即爲歐戰擴大之時。凡此三端，可見荷比形勢緊張，決非事在荷比，影響所至，實關全局。依目今趨勢繼續推演，將使斯坎的那維亞以及波羅的海西岸各小國，被逼而聯合一致，形成英法外圍。屆時除南歐及巴爾幹情勢尚屬混沌外，歐洲各國勢力分野的輪廓，自將益形明顯，所可懷疑的是同牀異夢的德蘇究可合作到幾時？</p>

<h3>飛機與軍艦孰强</h3>
<p>美國的海軍史家馬亨中將曾經說過，美國獨立戰爭和拿破崙戰爭，即一般人所認爲發生於陸地的，也不能完全沒有海戰，且在許多方面，勝敗的決定，海戰的成分，比較陸戰尤爲重要。</p>
<p>這次的歐戰自然不能例外。不過近年來，航空方面已有了突飛猛進的發展，道是與上次歐戰絕然不同的地方。空軍與海軍究　孰佔優勢的問題，因之引起了劇烈的爭論，匪特震動了海陸軍界，即在議會裏也曾起了辯論。許多擁護飛機的熱心份子堅持軍艦的時代已經過去了，擁護軍艦的人則同樣堅決的駁斥此種理論。全部論據在於飛機達到某點足以投彈轟炸目標時，能否不爲高射砲擊落。所投的炸彈擊損目的物能够達到何種程度。自然，轟炸機飛行愈低，擊中目標的機曾愈大，但被擊落的危險性也愈大。優游自若向無抵抗的目標轟炸，較之在密集高射砲火中投彈完全不同，高射砲火力愈準確，飛機擲彈的瞄準力就愈薄弱。飛機平時演習投彈時，高度超過萬四千英尺，就無法中的，但聞現代轟炸機所配備的新式轟炸鏡可增加擲彈中的的高度到二萬五千英尺，這種高度已非高射砲所能擊中。</p>
<p>還有一個主要原則，須加考慮的，就是轟炸損害的程度。炸彈愈重，損害愈大，但飛機裝載巨型炸彈是有限制的，飛機裝載的炸彈愈重，它的續飛力就愈小。還須注意擊中的是何種軍艦，擊損的是軍艦那一部。飛機擊炸軍艦能够損害到何種程度，外間雖有誇大的傳說，但至今還沒有定論。事實上無人能提出答案，在這次歐戰裏或可見其分曉。道次戰爭的置力英法兩國以海軍佔優勢，德國則以空軍無敵自誇。德國的飛機雖已屢次轟炸英國的軍艦，但其結果，除雙方發出矛盾的消息外，尚無眞確情報，足以獲得滿意結論。目下德國空軍的攻勢，尚只以轟炸英國東海岸數處軍事目標，和企圖擊破北海方面英法海軍封鎖錢及護送商船的軍艦爲限。</p>
<p>飛機向任何種目的物投彈轟炸時，炸彈投下的焦點，無論風力如何，常是圍繞着目的物成一圓形。其他各種情形如果相等，飛機進擊的方向常以目標的輪廓爲決定的要素。譬如轟炸軍艦時，從船頸或船尾投彈，較易中的。一個艦隊佈成陣勢，被轟炸的目標雖多，飛機進攻却不容易成功。因爲這種艦隊中的艘艟主艦固然易成目標，但是四周常有多艘巡洋艦和驅逐艦做衛星，這些軍艦都是配備高射砲的。英國海軍且有許多巡洋艦，除高射砲外，不裝他種軍備，它的任務是專門用以保護艦隊，對付敵機的。艦隊中還有航空母艦，它甲板上所載的飛機可以隨時飛起迎擊敵機。佈防充分的軍港，岸上也有高射砲和飛機保護艦隊。戰鬥艦和巡洋艦也多備有高射砲，可藉精密的儀器，用極快的速度，放射四五英寸的開花彈，還可助以重機關槍。</p>
<p>但天空中如有雲層密佈，飛機便可充分利用，從雲層裏穿出襲擊。這種襲擊的方式，待高射砲射擊時，飛機已達到目的物上面，投彈常很得手。飛機轟炸艦隊，可從各方面進攻，但最好是順着風勢，使飛機的速度藉以增加，或者借着陽光的掩蔽，以眩惑高射砲隊的描準。</p>
<p>飛機進攻時，機羣愈大，成功的機會愈大，因爲投下的炸彈，爲數旣多，飛機隻數增多，高射砲火集中力就减少了。大隊機羣轟炸時，常是九架或九　以上分批在不同的高度更番投彈。有的可用平行綫投彈術，有的可用疾飛直下法進擊。一架單獨的飛機轟炸單獨的軍艦最好用疾飛直下法擲彈。這種轟炸方法　準確，又最不容易被高射砲擊中。軍艦上的水兵遇着這種情形，如果駕駛敏疾，能在適當時機，急轉艦身，也可避免中的。一艘單獨的軍艦遇着兩架以上的飛機從不同的方面飛來轟炸，那就最感困難了，因爲多數軍艦的設備同時向各方面開放高射砲是不甚有效的。飛機攻擊單獨軍艦還有種有效的方法就是用機關槍掃射甲板上的艦員或高射砲手。（譯美國DhristianScienceMonitor報專稿）</p>
<h3>今日之西康　風景幽美物產豐富經營西藏應先西康</h3>
<p>成都通信、西康幅員寬廣、形似蝴蝶、爲一橫斷山脈區域、自北到南、爲舒拉山·怒山·寗靜山二雅龍山·大雪山·卭崍山·凡六大山脈、形成六大水流、爲雅魯藏布江·怒江·瀾滄江·金沙江·雅龍江•大度河、構成一自然優美之環境、但因山脈之橫斷、整個西康、交通盡被阻塞、西康在金沙江以　　三大風景區、（一）爲金沙江　　德格縣之擢拉河流蜿蜒、峽形彎曲、與嘉陵江相髣髴、流連其問山麓、有湖縱橫二里、湖水澄碧、環湖靑松翠柏、山巓積雪、有如白帽、山腰茂樹、無異綠衣、其秀麗可與瑞士公園媲美、所無者僅雕畫之游艇與連袂之游客而已、但此層缺陷、正可留給中國靑年前往彌補、其左近有峽、雄偉異常、故可稱之爲雪峽、（二）擢拉山西有一河峽、水有怡然自得之慨、故可名爲怡峽、（三）擢拉山附近另有一峽、兩壁矗立、高達四十公尺、水流湍激、山石嶙峋、有削壁突出半空狀、如覆蓋、上有古樹、奇枝彎曲盤繞、叢林茂樹、環藎成蔭、峽壁狹隘處、望之不能喘氣、因可名之曰峻峽、自德格至白玉間、亦有三其嶺、最高者在一千五百公尺以上、於山腰四百公尺處、有大喇嘛廟一座、滿山積雪沒膝、風景之幽潔、非常人所能領　、自喇嘛廟下山、無異置　植物圍中、松柏連枝疊葉、樹幹　　、寄生植物、馬行綠蔭中、踏堆積山徑之敗葉、簌簌作響、悅耳可聽、出叢林有極廣之草原、其平整無異人工剪割、遙望崇山峻嶺、白帽綠衣、林木行列、氣象萬千、若憇足此處、可望見山麓白玉縣及環繞縣城之河道、無異自飛機上作鳥瞰、若騎馬自由腰喇嘛廟起行、須半月始抵山麓、故若闢爲公園、即可以白玉公園名之、以之作爲避　勝地、匡廬莫干、恐亦難望其項背、</p>
<p>社會生活</p>
<p>西康男子、大部不事生產、優秀聰慧者、盡入喇嘛寺爲僧、普通人民、隨身常佩武器、因之社會治安、亦受其影響、西康之女子、其工作服役之辛動勞苦、遠非其他各地婦女所能勝任、凡耕植運輸牧畜操作一切事務、均由其担負誠爲中國女子中最盡力最能吃苦耐勞者、、西康女子之健美、社交之公開大方、尤足稱道、</p>
<p>西康各地人口、呈畸形狀態、如德格喇嘛廟中有九百餘喇嘛僧、人民僅廿餘家、理化人民、僅一千餘、而喇嘛竟多至三千餘、人民對喇嘛絕對尊敬、其葬禮分爲天葬、火葬·水葬·土葬·四種、以火葬爲最光榮、不喜土葬、至於宗敎之費邇與深印民心之程度、可於遍地刻着藏經石碑及人民經過石碑時口中默念經文以見其一班、西康人民、亦不乏藝術天才與愛好藝術之情緒、如喇嘛廟偉大之壁畫雕刻、民閒歌唱舞蹈之普遍、都足以表現康人的生活不完全是乾枯無味、康民飲食、以茶·酥油·綹粑·鹽·爲每日必需品、康民服裝寬大且長、白晝以帶束腰、使不下拖着地、晚即用作被褥、衣無口袋、故一切用具食品、均可置於腰間、</p>
<p>各屬建設</p>
<p>西康建設、現正在中央與地方合力推動中發展、當寗屬雅屬未歸併入西康時、因康屬地廣人稀、一切建設、無從規劃、自劃入西康後、人口驟增、物產豐富、故建設始有計劃推進、但雅屬因技術人材較多、且接近中央指導、物產豐富、交通稍優、故推進較易、而康屬則地曠人稀、技術人材缺乏、如白玉縣全縣僅有木匠二人、故工作推進方面、自難與雅屬並駕齊驅、至於寗屬雖有豐盛之糧食、足以協助康屬、但因寗屬困於烟毒、體質孱弱、建設方面、不免　受影響、</p>
<p>農牧礦產</p>
<p>茶爲雅屬大宗出產、去年產量爲二十一萬包、每包十六公斤、西藏藥材皮毛之輸出、大部以雅屬所產之「邊茶」爲父換、但近因印度茶之暢銷、市塲多有被奪之危險、故爲繼續維持雅屬固有邊茶之推銷市塲、爲不使西康財政上少一來源、爲使西藏土產仍不斷交換、常從改良品質、减低成本、便利運輸、廣爲種植諸點上積極着手、雅屬鐵礦甚豐、康民以土法取鍊、但成積甚佳、其餘硫磺·銅•鉛·鋅·銻·瑪瑙•等產量均豐、但金之蘊產量較少、</p>
<p>寗屬之礦產、以鐵礦蘊藏爲最富、年有七八百多萬噸之儲蓄量、且爲最優之磁鐵礦、其餘銅·煤•鹽·產量亦豐、黃金之蘊藏、遠勝於雅屬、大規模之金礦有四、土人有「以斗量金」之語、康屬則以黃金之產量爲最盛、雅屬露藏布江流域、蘊藏尤富、此外銅鉛等礦蘊藏量亦豐、康屬之畜牧特盛、牛塲之設、每縣多至幾百處、每處牛數十頭、尤以石渠縣爲最盛、除縣府係固定之房屋外、其他全屬畜牧逢帳、因此乳•酥油·皮毛·產量極　、康屬之森林、以金沙江流域爲　茂盛、兩人合抱之樹木、到處皆是、但土人因森林阻礙畜牧、竟有全部焚燬者、誠爲可惜、若能取作造紙、則整個西康紙張之需要、即不成問題、深惜康民造紙用最古舊之方法、每家造紙、一日最多不過出數十張、此寳貴天然富源、實有待於開發與利用、此外寗靜山之石油、亦有大量藴藏、</p>
<p>水利問題、爲整個西康之天然利源、六大榦流上下之湍急度、相差有二千公尺、康定附近六十里之水道、即可發十萬匹馬力、其可發出之電力至七萬多幾羅瓦特、若合全西康之水力供作工廠電力之發動、其利益豈可以筆羅數字計、且因康屬無煤產尤宜藉水力以補此缺陷</p>
<p>交通問題</p>
<p>一般認爲西廣多山、實則平源亦多、故川康公路•康新公路、固應急行修築、但金沙江流域交通、亦不宜忽視、因西康交通、全賴「烏拉」、（藏文當差意、凡遇旅行運輸、由當地人民輪流供應馬匹人員）、但自康定至巴安一途、「烏拉」制度極壞、巴安之果樹產量、豐美異常、其葡萄蘋果、足與美產媲美、若將此段水道開發、則水流平穩、運輸迅速、一切藥材皮毛果植產物、均可順流而下、裨益康民經濟不少、</p>
<p>此外尚有二點足以見重西康者、（一）西康爲漢藏之橋樑、如不建設西康、即無從經營西藏、（二）西藏有國際作用、因海道輸運旣斷、惟有藉後方陸地之交通、西康可由正安鹽井經德欽入雲南、又可自鹽井察　至　底亞而通印度達新加坡、西康之重要旣如上述、但不能因此樂觀、故亟待於建設、其次、今日經營西康、不能希望其立即收效、當抱長期苦鬥之決心、脚踏實地一步一步做去、而所需大量技術人員則有待於靑年之踴躍投效</p>

<p>自動捐金　即如昨日、有趙福記個人自動捐助五千元、交入金城銀行、今日復有存心堂個人自動捐助一萬元、交入上海銀行、其他如無名氏等、零星捐款、亦頗為踴躍、具見熱忱、尤深佩　、所望各界源源樂助、對兩租界警務當局允予盡力維護、亦頗感激、並希望前往各米號購米之平民、嚴守秩序、好在此次平糶範圍、較前擴大、時間又長、不難普及也、</p>
<p>今日實行　米號業公會接受委託、指定　百家會員米號辦理平糶、計公共租界三十處、法租界二十處、每處一家發米、一家售票、準今日下午一時起、由警務處探捕保護之下、實行平糶、每處每日糶五十包、至下午六時糶完為止、昨日已由平糶委員會向棧房內、提出平糶米二千五百包、分發給發米之五十家米號、其米票式樣「上海平糶委員會平糶米票、」內註明「日期」「憑票發碎米一元」「他處不得適用隔日作廢」及「第〇處」字樣、</p>

<h3>荷輪　增駛星島</h3>
<p>南洋羣島航行、向以荷蘭及英國之航輪行駛者為最多、尤以新加坡一處、因商業繁盛、人口驟增、英輪往來該島、素稱頻繁、頃悉自歐洲方面發生戰事後、行駛南洋各地之英輪、受歐洲航行困難之影響、曾一度將輪運班次減少、最近一月以來、英法航輪在各地時遭交戰國襲擊後、英國方面、以遠東航行、亦時有危險、為避免發生意外事件起見、均紛紛停航、故目前行駛南洋羣島之英輪、所剩無幾、新加坡方面航輪、已逐漸以荷蘭郵船替代、聞星洲當局曾與荷蘭輪船公司訂有荷輪行駛該島之辦法、在戰事未發生前荷輪行駛南洋航綫者、約五十餘艘、自歐戰發生、英輪停航後、荷輪頻見增多、據悉最近統計、已在一百艘以上、為從來未有之現象、</p>
<h3>日機三架　轟炸櫟社　該處機場早經破壞　日機濫炸毫無意義</h3>
<p>據航空界昨晚接得電報、日機三架、於前（十九）日下午一時、結隊飛至寗波南門外櫟社轟炸、共投彈二十四枚、當被炸傷農民一人、別無損失、</p>
<p>機讓機　場早毀</p>
<p>查寗波南門外櫟社、在抗戰發動前篆有飛機場、戰事起後、日機曾不斷飛往轟炸、嗣於去年冬間、寗波當局奉上峯命令、將該機場徹底破壞、土埋即交農民耕種、並將櫟社鎮上居民疏散、故日機此番再往轟炸、毫無意義、</p>
<p>日艦再　轟鎮海</p>
<p>又據大通社記者探悉、日艦四艘、於十六日分上下兩次向鎮海開砲後、十七日即未開砲、至十八日下午二時、仍在龍山及蟹浦一帶、日艦於開砲後、即行駛離鎮海口外瞭標嘴海面、要塞駐軍仍嚴予戒備、防其再犯、</p>

<p>休假三週</p>
<p>余未得休假者巳年餘矣」、至於工部局與上海「市府」談判滬西越界築路問題、未有確切之新進展、警務與捐稅等重要問題、仍在討論中、尚未商妥具體計劃、預料廢歷新年前不能獲得解決、昨日某晨報所載越界築路區將設聯合警務機關一說、</p>
<p>完全無稽</p>
<p>足以令人發生誤會云、又上海泰晤士報載稱、工部局某高級官員昨日聲稱、關於工部局與上海「市府」之談判、務望公眾對非正式消息、弗加注意、茍非工部局與上海「市府」對此事已獲完全妥洽、則雙方均</p>

<p>德商禮和洋行之新江南輪、由福華輪船公司代理、行駛上海天生港、於前日下午一時半、由滬駛天生港、及至下午五時許、駛至楊林口、被日商東亞海運會社之新亞丸撞沉、死船員二名、傷船員二名、旅客死傷未明、遇救船員旅客、昨晨已抵滬、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>新亞丸由　後側衝撞</p>
<p>新江南輪總噸一百五十七噸、長一百零六尺、係德商禮和洋行所有、由九江路一一三號福華輪船公司代理、專駛上海天生港綫、以裝貨載客為主、過去曾駛上海北沙綫、該輪於前日下午一時半、由滬直放天生港、未裝貨物、僅載旅客四十餘名、預備抵天生港後、再裝大批貨物返滬、及至日下午五時、該輪駛至楊林口外時、詎適有大華輪在其前側行駛、而大華輪之後側、復有日商東亞海運會社之新亞丸、由蕪湖裝貨駛滬、自新江南輪越過大華輪之後、新亞丸適從其後側衝出、致新江南與新亞猛烈互撞、而新江南係一小輪、右利用率腹部即受損、</p>
<p>船身沉沒　搭客獲救</p>
<p>新江南被撞之後、船內機艙即進水、約一小時許完全沉沒、船員及旅客當經新亞丸設法施救、共計救起船員旅客總約一百名、轉登新亞丸、於昨晨抵滬、船泊楊樹浦三十一號浮筒、福華公司得報後、即派美多（譯音）小輪、由經理德人杜拿歲、前往楊樹浦迎接、至十一時許始登陸、新聲社記者昨向福華公司探悉、新江南輪被撞沉後、該公司已將被撞經過、及船老大陸和祥之報告、向德商禮和洋行報告、今巳查明者、有船員（燒飯）鄭阿富一名已身死、（茶房）王謀芳（機匠）劉阿青受傷、已送仁濟醫院、經診視後、傷勢尚輕、無性命之憂、旅客死傷不明、大約並無死傷、</p>

<p>碍於環境　取流動性</p>
<p>日偽方面、對戰區縣府機關、無異視為眼中之釘、輾轉設法派遣奸徒、化裝鄉民下鄉探查縣府所在地後、用軍事或其他方法、從事破壞、故去幾有一時期、縣府機關碍於環境、改為流動性質、全視軍事勢力為轉移、同時並嚴緝奸黨秘密經營破壞工作、迭經拘獲間諜式之罪犯、經偵訊明確、實行正法、以寒其膽、</p>
<p>縣府機構　日臻健全</p>
<p>目前江南戰區、華方流動部隊積極招募補充、日方絕對不敢再以兵力壓迫、各縣縣府在離日據點較遠之地方、由流動性改為固定性、雖縣府房屋不拘形式上之美觀、然辦公機構均已獲得穩定地位、絕非日偽再能加以破壞、奉賢松江等數縣、日方明知其所在地、亦不敢輕易進犯、故各縣縣府機構、　日臻健全、</p>

<h3>工部局一九三九年份　保障兒童工作</h3>
<p>前年十二月間、本局工業科主任、曾以關於婢女問題之報告一件、呈由木局送請領袖領事轉遞國聯秘書長、以備國聯奴隸委員會之參考、上項報告、曾稱所謂婢女、僅係脫離近親而受他人家庭雇用之婦女之一種、其他如養女·童養媳·以及無數年幼女工等等、亦均受他人管束、爲其家庭服役、此外尚有大批女童、常經本生父母轉讓、以致受人束縛、但非在家庭中作工、若輩或經典鬻爲娼、或在介紹人管束之下、進入紗廠作工、所有工資收入、在一定年限內、統歸介紹人領受、至于男童亦有被父母轉讓面入工廠習藝之情事、此輩學徒、工作時間頗長、由雇主供給膳宿、但以無工資者居多、雇主所給膳食、至爲　敗、致使若輩因營養不足而患病、山此觀之、本埠有數千兒童、脫離本生家庭、雖其方”不一、但其生命無不在他人掌握之中、且常迺蹂躪、景况至慘、本局工業科主任、鑒於此項問題、性質複雜乃向局方建議、請用一切可能方法、使轉讓兒童之事件、向本局各主管人員報告並請設立「兒童保障科、」由工業科主任兼任該科主任、該主任又請局方與保護兒童之中外各團體密切合作、以上各項建議、均經接受、</p>
<p>大批孤兒受人利用</p>
<p>自戰事發生以來、本埠有大批孤兒或已入他人掌握之中希受其利用、或有陷于此等地位之虞、最近兩年間、就捕房解送兒童保障科處理之案件而言、因父母死于戰事而被隣人鬻賣之兒童、爲數不少、此外幼年男女、受丐頭之指揮、行乞街頭、亦屬屢見不鮮、本局對於此輩兒童、誠欲一一設法予以保護、然人數旣如此衆多、能力恐有未逮、</p>
<p>地方敎會協助工作</p>
<p>本局承認兒童保障科所担任之工作、如欲使社會信任、非先使民衆了解不可、「上海地方敎會」鑒於兒童保障科所任工作之重要、曾聘用社會工作專員一人、襄理該科工作、該會之熱誠、至爲局方所感荷、</p>
<p>遭難兒童可分四類</p>
<p>查受人剝削之兒童、可分爲下列四類、（一）在家庭環境下者、有婢女·養女•童養媳·及女傭等等、（二）經捕房注意之乞丐·及走失迷路·或無家可歸·或受人遺棄·或被拐離家之兒童等、（三）嚮導員舞女及娼妓等、（四）工廠中僱用之兒童、有在包工制度下之女工及無工資之學徒等、</p>
<p>保障工作預定計畫</p>
<p>上年初、兒童保陣科主任曾向局方陳稱、上述四類兒童、除第一類外、均可設法尋覓、惟在家庭環境之下者、因情形複維、尋覓不易、保護較難、是以該科先從其他三類着手、俾有成績可觀、並使民衆知悉該科之工作情形、至於婢女問題之處理、尚須從緩、</p>
<p>案件處理力求適當</p>
<p>上年間、凡經捕房發現之兒童、屬於第二類者、均經該科安置、在該科未成立以前、此等案件、概山捕房送交法院分別發落、據法院之通常辦法、係將若輩分置於某某兩機關、此後若輩之幸福、爲當道所不問、自上年一月份起、該科與本局總裁·曁警務處長商定、嗣後此類事件、當改用社會之手續處理、所有此輩兒童、除須出庭作證者外、不再解送法院、倘有解送之必要、則該科應派代表到庭、陳述其關於處分方法之意見、現在各捕房均照該科所定辦法將男女分送兩臨時收容所、由該科職員每晨前往各該收容所調查案情、並設法安揷、凡來滬覓業而誤入迷途之靑年婦女、一經發現、即山該科辦理、一面竭力助其覓業、一面查訪其親屬、以便通知、經各機關收養之兒童、先受身體檢查、如有必要、即送醫院診視、已達法定結婚年齡之婢女、因不能如願出嫁而脫逃者、由該機關協助成婚其所持理山、爲主婦對於婢女之婚姻、無權干涉、綜觀上年各項工作成績良佳、所經受理案件之性質及其處理之方法、見本報告附錄、</p>
<p>捕捉丐童免爲匪徒</p>
<p>自戰事爆發以後、本埠「兒童保育會」曾設法收容販報男女兒重、予以保護及讀書之機會、並收留大批丐童、兒童保障科有鑒於此、爰於上年八月間商請兩捕房捕捉流浪街頭之丐童、送交該科核辦、迄年終爲止、丐童案件經該科處理者共一二六起、此項工作、雖進行不甚迅速、但希望　後有大批丐童得送交該科處理、就已調查之案件而言、其中能代覓得親友者爲數不少、此類丐童、倘不給以較優之生活、則將來造成歹徒、常可斷言、</p>
<p>救濟機關均予津貼</p>

<p>上海已於昨晨開始飛雪、唯氣候並未酷寒、除上海外、漢口·南京·亦飄揚雪花中、茲分述各情如次、</p>
<p>首次見雪</p>
<p>據大通社記者探悉、昨晨本埠雖開始見雪、惟當早晨五六時間之最低溫度、尚在攝氏零上一度八、華氏爲三十五度一、遠較去年冬至前後、受西伯利亞寒流、兩度襲擊時之氣候爲溫和、</p>
<p>寒流所在</p>
<p>查西伯利亞高氣壓、仍向東南東進行、故東西省已受寒流影響、查中蘇交界之滿洲里、昨晨氣溫尚在攝氏零下三十一度、吉林溫度亦落至攝氏零下二十八度、</p>
<p>平津晴和</p>
<p>寒流如循東南東方向推進、中國北部及長江流域曁上海各地、均可免爲所襲、縱使間接感受影響、惟亦極微細、按昨晨平津天氣、反較上海爲晴暖、</p>
<p>降雪時間</p>
<p>本埠昨晨之雪、其始降時間在一時左右、當上午八時許、比較濃密、卒因地面氣候之溫和、未及墮地、即行溶化、故馬路始終未爲雪水所濕潤、午後雪降轉密、馬路爲雪水浸潤、</p>
<p>氣候尙穩又據天文台消息、昨晨長江流域、如漢口·南京·兩地亦飛揚雪花惟因平津氣候之良好、照此推斷、則上海天氣不致趨於惡劣、且無大雪、</p>

<h3>糧食　粉麥恐慌聲中　美粉麥將大量運華　美政府予粉麥津貼專銷中菲　粉廠正思居奇無殊晴空霹靂</h3>
<p>昨日市況仍不脫嚴重狀態、二號粉廠盤雖維持十元原價、而限制依然嚴厲、對客幫猶一律搾不批售、蓋以各廠存粉雖豐、大利所在、不願輕售、以待善價、致造成回籠粉價再創新高峯、按目下烟青及秦皇島等處、實銷並不濃厚、乃因以粉易貨關係、並預有保證金繳存、雖運粉虧耗甚巨、亦不得不飲鴆止渴、此種環境、實為商場歷史所僅見、所以廠方一經關住、棧單貨高價　見疊出、溫無止境、昨市成交除廠家批售平衡約有一萬包外、車船回籠貨交易、亦不足萬包、砲車牌售價則已漲達十一元六角至六角半、兵船牌漲至十一元四角半至五角、洋粉浮存已枯、價格一再居奇、間有直接配銷者、已　正式行市、昨有麵粉三千包運香港、五百包運廈門、</p>
<p>小麥市況、仍在相持中　貨主居奇日甚一日、而日商粉廠之收買、依然不絕、致市面一再暗　、日昨公開市價既到十八元五六角、暗盤已達十九元之新高峯、查目下滬市存麥不足十萬包、內地雖有存麥、均被某方佔住、來源已告失望、所幸一電傳來、美國農業部對於太平洋口岸各埠運赴香港中國之小麥出口、允予以津貼、洋粉出口、亦在津貼之外、以便消納美國過剩小麥、一千五百萬蒲失爾、有此大量粉麥接濟、復有美政府津貼、大可紓中國粉麥恐慌之隱憂、可以打銷粉商操縱之野心、雖遠水難救近火、但中國粉麥如再高、美粉麥必能予以嚴重之打擊、何況中國對於以前棉麥借款仍如期償付、以全信用歟</p>
<h3>米價仍堅　日人在錫買白粳</h3>
<p>米市仍以內地來源不旺、昨衹有虹口轉出之青角薄稻五百餘包、又以洋米產地價格續漲、銀根緊促等問題、繼呈好面、晨間開手、即有一般內地幫採辦、繼則本鄉店胄納意亦濃、客販方面、以新到之貨、身本均重、一遇有人問津、喊聲迭高、厚粳除常崑高貨未有出樣外、其中等之蘇同粳、市貨亦稀、交易不多、而行情悉提半元、同里粳計開四十元、其他青角特薄開三十九元二角至三十九元、較之前日俱增半元至六七角不等、統計全市各貨成交約有一萬四五千包、</p>
<p>洋米高檔尚難通劃、碎米則續成五百噸、價為三十三元三角、又福家拋出東京秈、一百噸、價三十二元、現西貢新定既少、鋪作鄉客納胄又食、行囤亦有吸收、價乃續大三四角、碎米亦跟砌二三角、但除定貨未到外、市存尚有七萬包、西貢一二號及　越各米亦有十五萬包、洋米高次已到未到、約有四五十萬包之夥、而碎米尚在賡續訂定中、故米市如無軌外操縱、或不致過昂云、</p>
<p>無錫米市、自十八日各城門開放、水陸交通恢復、米市狀況、門售行號、紛補粳米、市價扶搖直上、日商又連日分向行廠訂購大量白粳、運日接濟、以致米稻市價、將限價二十元五角一石打破、每百六十市斤須二十二元、而稻船來源其稀、有未做拋貨各行、不得不補進、高白粳　石至二十一元三角、白杜子羊尖二十一元三角、糙粳二十元左右、粳稻十元二角、惟白元因酒坊需要滿足、反覺去化疲落、每石二十二元、現在棧存稻五十餘萬市擔、合米二十五萬石、充其數量、衹可接銷至春令、惟農民手中之穀、為數頗巨、（知）</p>
<h3>金融　匯市清閑　美將貸華新借款　使外匯愈形穩定</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市況、匯豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美匯暗市、因週六衹半天行市、買賣清閒、靜中略現鬆硬、惟結果與隔昨收盤不分榮辱、至半　情況、晨開均平、　因絲茶商略來賣出、且華行亦塞、同時投機商浮多亦稍了結、市勢一度微硬、期時外行最賤曾吸過四辦士八七五及八元〇三一二五、旋以賣者絕跡、故市象遂形回平、迄至午收、仍為四辦士八四三七五及八元、與上日相埒、期貨潛勢與現貨無別、</p>
<p>按市上頗有在陽歷歲首前後、將有大宗進口棉麥結款之說、一般皆料外匯有轉緊之勢、惟至今英美匯仍起伏於五便士及八元關邊、非惟未見緊縮、目有續鬆可能、此蓋與美國貸華新借款、頗有影響、據金融界消息、中國駐美大使胡適之博士、近頃與美政府簽立一千萬元美金信用貸款、聞是項新貸款、一部份係用以抵償前次購訂美麥者、其餘則購汽車之用、且聞美政府對華信用放款、現仍照預定之一億元美金數字、繼續洽商、並未因歐戰稍更初志、則外匯之由穩轉鬆、有自來矣、</p>
<p>絲茶商略有賣出</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠期均跌一一五、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美·滬·法等各匯俱平、美對英縮二五、對滬未更、對法小二五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士八四三七五、美匯八元、較之前收、均無軒輊、開後市況岑寂、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉跌一分二五、此後絲茶出口商略來吐售、同時華行亦有賣出、故情勢稍形硬化、計出口商吐予外行現貨美匯八元〇三一二五、及華行售予大通本月份英金四辦士八五九三七五、時現貨價亦鬆至四辦士八七五、不久投機商亦賣予外行本月份美匯八元、嗣後賣者轉少、故市勢遂形回平、午刻外行互做現貨英金四辦士八五九三七五、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價英金四辦士八四三七五、美匯八元、下月期英金四辦士七八一二五、美匯七元八七五、結果比上日現期均無榮辱、午後週六無市、</p>

<h3>金市呆滯如故　只有五元上落</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市況、因週末關係、人心渙散、故市價頗形呆滯、中途衹五元上落、惟情勢仍告疲軟、結果再降落四元、而半日經過、初開撳小五元、為四千〇四十元、原因證券幫稍塞、嗣以某錢兌業與某證券幫互相搜入、曾見二度回平、卒因錢兌業及現金號均滿懷賣意、故午收仍衹四千〇四十一元、午後場內無市、而場外亦鮮乏變動、至半天成交不多、僅有二百數十兩、銀樓鉓金呆定、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤又小四元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開局勢平疲、首由證券幫出銀樓幫二十兩、為四千〇四十元、較前收撳低五元、少頃某錢兌業稍來撈進、同時某證券幫亦買、遂同起五元、某錢兌業進同業二十兩、為四千〇四十五元、嗣以另一錢兌業與現金號互相吐出、復又降小四元、現金號售予銀樓幫三十兩、為四千〇四十一元、旋因某證券幫復來搜入、又見回升、證券幫進錢兌業一十兩、為四千〇四十五元、卒以銀樓幫突來復出、再告下降、十一時許銀樓幫賣予錢兌業二十兩、為四千〇四十一元、此後買賣觀望不前、直至午收仍未做開、故收價作為四千〇四十一元、結果比上日又小四元、半天衹五元上落、現金號之本牌售出價、照烚赤較高數元、收進減低二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金安然不動</p>

<h3>證券　美新借款傳說　內債交易驟盛　市價續漲一二角外</h3>
<p>證券盤、昨市午前平穩、午後交易驟盛、價亦挺秀、因外灘關東糖及金子幫及紗布幫紛買進、傳言美國一千萬借款、以之償付棉、麥借款及購汽車之用、其初無從證實、故浮多乘高出籠者亦不弱、丙種又逼近五十一元、發息愈近、袖空當有一番熱閙也、昨日上午交易、衹數萬成交、信孚潤利稍有丙甲胄量、乙戊尤稀、聯和供出、午後順泰突有買進胄量較宏、間泰隨之、中間金子及紗布幫又有需要、泰豐號繼之而起、潤利加碼、同順補空、天生吸收亦不弱、價乃逐步堅俏、大通生大同康聯和乃趁高價出籠、交易驟見熱鬧、市價結果、略好五分一角至一角半、成交總數約計五十萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<p>昨日眾業公所股市、趨勢極穩、衹上海銀公司股因宣布股息而有兀餘漲風、橡皮股價格維持亦佳、目下對此、各方並無急切需求之象、</p>

<h3>紗花　紗市由疲轉堅　棉花交易寂靜</h3>
<p>現紗市情、始疲後堅、晨開以外棉續跌、買氣渙散、浮多急於脫手了結、二十支雙馬跌至七百二十元關邊、旋以匯票尚平、業中不乏趁低搶進、港幫亦稍有採辦、櫃面籌碼、頓感缺乏、市價逐步回升、由七百二十四元、而抬至七百二十八元、收盤二十支雙馬為七百二十六元五角、天女七百二十二元、特金城七百二十三元、雙地球六百九十元、市面向榮、漲過於跌、比上日午前收價反好一至三元、昨日成交約計　千六百餘包、同業估　千二百包、而今日出口紗據調查所得、約有三百餘包、計五十七包運廈門、一百四十五包運港、二十包運廣州灣、四十五包運海口、一包運海防、茲將昨日現紗市場各幫成交數於左、</p>

<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日又趨靜寂、利物浦幫之在市賣出及孟買來電之降落、</p>
<p>殊使市況疲乏、後因有一部份之結價、棉價格形回升、結果較上日近期跌八磅音、遠期跌十磅首、印度連同預測跌十餘羅比、埃及跌二十餘磅音、利物浦跌十餘便士、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來雖形熱鬧、但衹限於同業、廠方交易則異常靜寂、日方廠商亦然、蓋因近來紗價未見起色、故大量之交易、將於廢暦新年之後、茲將昨日棉市以美匯八元折合送廠價如下、</p>

<h3>煤炭　大雪紛飛　白煤售價抬高</h3>
<p>白煤行情、前因銷路呆滯、市氣未免遜色、近日大雪陰寒、消胃突健、來貨又因船隻稀少、每噸水腳漲起三先令、故市盤一律抬高、日昨海峯白煤暴漲十元、鴻基煤亦漲五元、反實為主、令人側目、故門莊售價、亦有變動、計開海峯白煤每噸一百三十六元、鴻基白煤一百三十二元、路遠客戶、酌加行槓、</p>

<h3>統計　物價之變動</h3>
<p>廿八年十·十一月份（二）</p>
<p>十月份漲價共計十八起，較十月份減四十八起。原因在本月份裏，外匯是逐步的放長，以致物價有回跌的現象，所以，漲價的商品，除非另有原因外，是不能再可不顧事實上而高漲了呢。所以，漲價起數較少—月份三倍弱。就十八起漲價　品的類別，可分醫藥，飲食，印刷出版，土木燃料，日用品及文化用具等七類。中以飲食五起為第一位；醫藥和印刷出版各四起第二位，日用品　起第三位；土木，燃料，文化用具各　起殿末位，可是米價在—一月內大漲特漲竟叩四—元之關，茲將漲價商品和成數分述於下。</p>

<h3>如何養成自修的習慣</h3>
<p>— 宛文</p>
<p>自己進修學業，這在不能自治的小朋友是感到困難的，　把學校中自修課做例，假使沒有敎師監視，便大聲談話閙得天翻地覆，連在自修的同學也被擾得不能讀書，直到敎師出現在門口，聲音才突然的靜下來，這種不良的習慣，非但把寶貴的光陰費去了，而且對於我們前途也有妨碍，試問我們的一生是否時時有他人來督促，來監視，如沒有自修的習慣，那麼新的學識，新的文化，就不會知曉，僅以從前所得的一些死的知識來對時時急進的時代，不被淘汰便是個落伍者了。所以從今天起，亦是假期剛開始的時候，正是我們養成自修習慣的好機會，讓我們來充分利用吧！</p>
<p>我們如果考究大發明家大學問家和偉大人物的歷史，可以知道他們大多數是家境窮困，無力求學，他們的學問，完全由於孜孜不倦的自攻自讀而得來的，所以我們在享受他們的貢獻外，還要仿做他們自學的態度和精神。假期是開始了，按着我們的需要，自動的列成自修的課程表，依照自己的興趣，選擇喜歡的書報，補習不及格的科目溫習　的課本，使我們的學識更澈底，使我們的眼光更擴大。可是習慣造成，我以爲有以下數點要注意。</p>
<p>（一）繼續不斷的去做；小朋友最易患的毛病，就是起初幾天很高興的做着，隔不了數天，就厭煩了，懈怠了，非但以後一無所成，而且前功盡棄。</p>
<p>（二）專心專志的去做：無論做什麼事，要專心，才能成功，如果在（自修）的時候，一會兒遊玩，一會兒談話，雖然費了許多時間，也得不到一些益處。</p>
<p>（三）不是艱難的去做：在自修的時候，困難是不免的，只要不怕羞恥的問，問我們的父母，姊妹兄弟，和同學，誰能解決我艱難的，就是我們的敎師，唯一的不開口的敎師是字典，我們時時要親近它，成爲我們唯一的朋友。</p>
<p>小朋友們，趕快的去做，切實的去做吧！</p>
<h3>聲聞五十里</h3>
<p>— 斐漢</p>
<p>小朋友們！常你們在學校中操塲　彼此站得很遠地講話時，你們一定要大聲叫喊，否則便要聽不淸楚或竟聽不到，如果相隔再遠些，一里，數里，十數里或數十里，那就得用郵信，電話或電報來傳話了。你們想，這當然是一定的。</p>
<p>但是在南極和北極的地方，那裏的空氣冷而乾燥，這種察氣傳達聲浪的力量亦極大，速而遠，所以在南極北極的人們，平常談話的聲音，立刻就可傳達到很速很遠而不可看見的地方，有的聲波可傳播到十哩之外；有的十五哩；還有的竟達於十七哩之外，合華里有五十四里多（1哩=3.219市哩）。就是在地上行走的聲音也能被三哩外的人聽見，要是有響喨的軍號聲就要聲聞數百里了。所以南北極的人們，在五十里內，儘可用極普通的聲音，互相談話，不需用電話，電報，郵信之類的傳話器了。</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們覺得奇怪嗎？這都因爲南北極的空氣同我們此地的空氣不同的緣故呀！</p>
<h3>新寓言</h3>
<p>— 公超</p>
<p>四川某地的山上多猴。人們是怎樣捕捉猴子的呢？</p>
<p>一個人搖一隻船，靠在山脚下，船上舖滿了猴子歡喜吃桃子之類。人躱在船艙裏，不久船板上就跳躍着大大小小的猴子，盡情地攫取食物。於是躲在艙裏的人，偷偷地用篙子把船撐開，越撐越遠，等到猴子發覺，船已經在水中央了。</p>
<p>猴子知道上了當，一齊拚命圍攻人，人卻不慌不忙，一手拿着刀，一手拿着一隻鷄，身邊還擺着一隻專關猴子的籠子子。他一刀把鷄頸砍去，於是鮮血直冒，猴子們一見這情景，嚇得打顫，一齊停止了攻打。</p>
<p>人就把那沒頭的鷄，高高舉起，用刀尖威逼着那些顫抖着的猴子，乖乖地一一進了　子。</p>
<p>猴子因爲怕流血，就做了人的奴隸。</p>
<h3>錯誤的心裏</h3>
<p>— 叔善</p>
<p>打牌在上海是十分風行，不論大戶小家都把它作爲家庭的消遺品了。</p>
<p>到得一吃好了中飯，今天沒有興緻到外邊去，枯坐在家裏是怪寂寞的，於是東邀西請的叫了張家嫂嫂，李家阿姊……一輩吃飯沒有事的空閒人，湊成了一桌「麻將」搭子，一切打牌前的準備工作叫阿媽佈置得很妥貼，便一陣陣的牌聲開始演奏了。一圈一圈的輪流着，一副一副地毫不疲倦的「打」着。時光在牌聲劈拍」中逝去了。一轉瞬問又是四點多鐘，阿毛也背了書包從學校裏回家，他們已打了十二圈，還不肯歇手，輸的人想翻木，而贏的人還想多贏一些，於是牌在兩方絕不相同的慾望中繼續的進行。阿毛一踏進屋子，聽見了牌響，便很快的拋掉了書包，走到那打牌的一間屋子裏，他對於打牌是很感有興趣的。</p>
<p>他母親有了些小事，便叫他替打幾副，他是非凡高興，因爲上次代母親打牌竟贏了不少的錢，後來母親買了很多的糖果給他。這回他聽得叫他替「打」，便忙不迭的坐了上去，因爲似希望母親叫他代打的念頭已有好久了。他對於打牌雖不能說很有研究，至少是很內行，加上他的牌運也不錯，一連「和」了好幾副牌，述了好幾次的「莊」。當他母親走近時，他又「和」了一副「辣子」三百「和」，很是興奮。那張家嫂嫂還稱贊他幾聲：「你們的阿毛眞是打牌老手，你去了之後，幾副牌都是他「和」的」。他母親的臉上也現出笑容，他當然是得意洋洋。他一直「打」到吃晚飯的光景，那牌塲也停了，這一次他又替他母親贏了錢。吃了晚飯之後玩了一回，便去睡覺，把學校裏的功課不知丟到那裏去去了。</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們看了上列的事實覺得怎樣？我想你們中間一定也有這樣的小朋友。我眞替那和阿毛一般的小朋友担心，因爲他們以爲打牌是一件平常的事，要知平常的事，它的影響不一定是平常的。那阿毛可說是中了打牌的毒還沒有知道，以爲替母親贏了錢，又受到人家的稱讚是榮耀的我更可以確定的說：凡是喜歡打牌的小朋友，他們一定不用功讀書的。打牌更可以養成賭博的習慣，尤其是像你們這樣的童年時代，要是有了賭博的習慣，那可以妨礙你們一生的事業！所以我是十二萬分誠意，希望喜歡打牌的小朋友快快　　這不良的習慣！</p>
<h3>黑兄弟（二）</h3>
<p>— 一木</p>
<p>格勒在家裏，只是做些零零碎碎的工作，譬如府房裏燻肉的時候，他就拏着鐵排，在火上翻來翻去，可是吃燻肉也是很難得的事，因爲他那兩個哥哥吝嗇性成，待人果然很刻薄，待自己也很會打算的。格勒一大半的時間，總是忙着擦皮鞋，擦地板，有時也要擦擦碟子，所以他所做的，等於一個下人的工作。</p>
<p>這山谷一帶的情形，始終沒有什麼多大的變動，不料末後來了一個雨水很多的夏季，於是四周的鄕村，一切都壞了。草秣還沒有拿進去，正高高的堆在塲地上，驀地來了一陣洪水，把草堆完全冲去，跟着大海飄去了：接着又是降雹，把葡萄全都打壞了；不但如此，所有五穀，也被一種黑色的害蟲，蹧躂得不成樣子；然而說也奇怪，只有這百寶谷裏，仍是平靜如常。這裏有雨，別處却沒有雨，這裏有陽光，別處却沒有陽光。四鄕的人因爲自己沒有收獲，都到黑兄弟的田莊裏來買五穀，他們去時，却沒有一個不痛恨他們，咒駡他們的，原來他們兄弟倆有意的抬高了價格，要多少就是多少，不怕人家不買，窮苦的人，沒有錢買，只得來回他們哀求佈施，他們倆却一槪拒絕，雖有人餓倒在他們的門前，也不做理會。</p>
<p>將近冬季的時候，天氣非常寒冷，有一天，黑兄弟倆因事出外，臨行照例的警告弟弟小格勒，不要讓什麼人進他們的屋子，也不要拿什麼東西出去。那時小格勒止坐在火旁，忙着燻羊肉，外面正下着大雨，廚房裏的四壁也濕淋淋的。他把那鐵排翻了又翻，上面的羊肉燻得好好的，變成了棕褐色。他暗暗的想道：「這是何等的可惜！我的兩位哥哥怎麼不請人家來吃一頓飯。他們能吃這樣一大塊挺好的羊肉，而人家却連這麼大的一塊乾麵包也沒有吃，要是、他們到這裏來一同來吃，那是於他們的心都是有益的。」</p>
<p>他正在這樣想，忽然聽得門上敲了兩下，那聲音很爲重濁，好像用布包了敲門的鎚子而敲的。格勒自言自語道：「這一定是一陣風刮在門上，决沒有人敢在我們的門上敲兩下的。」然而子細一聽，並不是風，當眞有人在敲門，這一回敲得重了；聽那聲音，那人分明是很性急的樣子。小格勒走到窗前，開了窗探出頭去，看是誰在敲門。</p>
<p>他一瞧之下，却是一個很矮小而模樣兒很奇怪的紳士，他生平所從來沒有瞧見過的。他有一個很大的鼻子，微微帶着古銅色；他的兩個面頰，很圓很紅，似乎是在過去四十八小時中烤足了火來的；他的兩眼，在那細細的睫毛下閃爍着，滿現愉快之色，他的鬍子，在嘴的兩邊雙雙捲起，圓圓的像兩個拔瓶塞的東西，他的頭髮很奇的是一種鹽和胡椒混合的顏色，長長地披在兩面的肩上。他的身子，的長四尺六寸，戴一頂尖尖的帽子，也足足有三四尺高，挿有一根三尺長的黑羽毛。他身上穿着一件緊身衣，後裾突出，好像現在所謂燕尾服的模樣，外面更罩着一件黑色而有光澤的長袍，被風吹着，足足比他的身體長出四倍來。</p>
<p>小格勒見了這位怪客，簡直呆住了，一句話都說不出口。那老紳士又在門上重重的敲了兩下，回頭看那被風刮起來的長袍。他就在這當兒，瞥見了小格勒那個黃髮的頭，正探在窗外，他的嘴和眼睛都張得大大的。老紳士改聲說道：「哈羅！你這樣的應門，未免太說不過去吧；快快讓我進來，我的衣服都濕透了。」</p>
<p>眞的，那老紳士眞的被雨打濕了。他那帽子上的黑羽毛，濕得倒垂下來，夾在兩腿之間，好像狗打急了，腿夾着尾巴垂頭喪氣的樣子。兩個鬚角也淌着水，直瀉到半臂袋裏去，又像磨坊的水　般再淌出水來。</p>
<p>小格勒忙道：「先生，我求你原諒，委實不能開門，對不起得很。」老紳士問道：「爲什麼不能？」小格勒道：「先生，我不能讓你進來，委實不能；要是依了你的話，我的兩位哥哥一定要打死我。先生，你要的是什麼啊？」</p>

<h3>戰時首都　重慶之平劇院</h3>
<p>— 張昌遒</p>
<p>昨友人自渝來函，詳述新都之平劇近况，茲節錄於后，以實本刋。渝地劇院，有漢劇，平劇，電影院等數處。平劇院僅山東省立平劇社一所，山王泊生君主辦：係曩昔韓復榘在山東發起者，軍興後始遷渝，並山政府津貼，從事獻演抗戰宣傳劇本，所有演員，均係泊生之弟子，平時相常刻苦，衣藍土布長袍，毫無浮華習氣。演員生活，亦具規律，上午上課，授以抗戰中，軍事，政洽知識。午後六時半至九時半演劇，僅三小時，而票價竟高至一元，一元五角，居然天天客滿，觀衆皆係中上階級，塲中且有憲兵維持秩序。演員台銜，均極生疎，滬人知之者甚鮮。頭牌靑衣台柱趙榮琛者，運腔近玉霜，扮相端莊，歌喉圓潤，表情長於悲艷，誠內地不可多得之靑衣人材也。一牌嚴富華，工靑衣花衫，嗓甚衝，扮相秀麗，惟咬字欠準，工力稍淺。趙致祥，靑衣小生亚擅，扮相瀟洒，舉止文雅，嗓音勁實。崔　係譚派鬚生，略具醇味，多抖音，乃美中不足。鐵錚工人面，兼黑頭，體魁梧，扮相頗　少山，嗓子尙稱宏亮。林貴蔭工靑衣花衫，扮相似畹華，嗓音雖不亮，尙甜潤，表情細膩，略具武工。至於武生人才，僅一王國田尙能差强人意，其下皆不足道。同一劇院中，旦角居前者凡四，亦罕見之事也。</p>
<h3>奚嘯伯率隊南來</h3>
<p>— 唯</p>
<p>新春出演黃金</p>
<p>鬚生奚嘯伯，坤旦侯玉蘭　人，日內即將抵滬，此來係應黃金之邀。茲將一行人馬，略記如左：</p>
<p>奚嘯伯　爲近年來後起鬚生中最佳之一人。嘯伯原係故都名票，藝宗言三，但嗓音則遠勝菊朋，旋爲　梅大王所賞識，邀之合作，爲蘭芳近年來之鬚生搭配，曾與梅合作出演滬港漢皐等處，極獲佳譽，年來蘭芳作寓公於香江，奚乃北返，投李洪春爲　師，自行組班。嘯伯年來更私淑溫如，藝取言馬二人之長，兼之嗓音遠勝言馬，故在平出演以來，頗能號召，者番重來海上，預料必更多精彩也。</p>
<p>侯玉蘭　近兩年來北方坤旦南來獻藝者，不知凡幾，但此中獲輿論稱贊者，玉蘭其　也。玉蘭爲　戲曲學校之高村生，在校時聲譽地位，咸不及趙金蓉，但離校後，玉蘭之藝，竟駕乎金蓉之上，去歲言菊朋南下，乃捨金蓉，而邀玉蘭同來，果然一唱而紅，玉蘭要亦可謂戲校諸生中，南來最紅之一人也。（亦戲曲學校學生首先南來之一人）玉蘭在滬載譽北返後，即爲　奚嘯伯延聘以去，玉蘭寗願寄人籬下，不岡虛榮，而自張一軍，誠可風也</p>
<p>茹富蕙　爲富連成丑角傑出人才，藝宗蕭長　，唸白表白神似老蕭，以方巾丑戲見長，嗓音響亮，演戲規矩，與馬富祿相較，馬以玩笑丑勝，方巾丑遠不逮富蕙也。富蕙前决曾隨譚富英來滬，演出成績極佳，鬚生戲本須要富蕙輩爲　配，始能恰到好處。此决嘯伯南來，有富蕙在，必收牡丹綠葉之效。</p>
<p>陳盛泰　此人未嘗來滬，係富連成四科中葉盛蘭外之唯一小生，前曾一度繼金仲仁後，與荀慧生合作，藝以穩健勝，上述諸人外，尙有王少亭裘盛戎高盛麟等人，王爲　梅蘭芳之老搭擋，裏子老生中之佼佼者，裘高在滬輟演未久，滬人當能憶及，恕不復贅。</p>

<h3>德國經濟戰之剖面</h3>
<p>— 獨行</p>
<p>反封鎖戰的效果不過如此中立各國的向背亦無把握　自蘇聯取得接濟也有相當的困難</p>
<p>西歐民主國對德國之戰略，除所謂神經戰及宣傳戰之外，最主要的厥爲經濟戰。而德國對付的方法，則爲反封鎖戰</p>
<p>德國大陸政策</p>
<p>然所謂封鎖與反封鎖戰爭，僅爲經濟戰之一環。其他重要之一環，實爲交戰國雙方之努力爭取中立國之同情。就歐洲大陸一隅而觀，德國此次似在抄襲拿破崙之『大陸政策』，以對付英國。故戰事發作之秋，德國即置波羅的海航運於其挺制之下，又進一步圖切斷斯坎的那半島諸國對英之輸出，在戰爭進行之中，希特勒小惜擊沉中立國船隻，企圖迫使瑞典挪威及芬蘭就範，使波羅的海之商務以基爾運河爲吞吐口。但因斯坎的那半島諸國決不甘放棄　西歐之主顧，及德國沒有能力供給彼等所需要之商品與原料，以及彼等欲取得其所需，必須對西歐輸出，德國並不能如願以償。同時即使德國達到　切斷斯坎的那牛島與西歐之商務關係，彼等之生產勢將陷於靜止，而無力供給德國所需之　品與礦產。</p>
<p>北歐諸國態度</p>
<p>波羅的海之形勢，方爲德國控制其出口，一方則爲大國監視其入口，所有進口船隻概須由英國海軍檢查。英國制止中立國船隻運輸原料至德國之企圖，雖不免與中立國權益有所磨擦，但中立國船隻對於英國之檢查，似頗樂於接受，這種態度使德國極爲憤激，數决抗議這抓『違反中立』的行動，且視之爲敵對行爲。然而除非德國冒險侵略北歐各小國，則實無能號召她們與彼採取同一行動以反抗英國之封鎖。須知海外貿易是北歐各小國的經濟命脈，如果央國日控制海上交通，則她們自不能接受德國之保護。</p>
<p>東南歐之競爭</p>
<p>至若東南歐的地位，則又自當別論了。德國在此方面之居於經濟盟主地位，正如英國在西北歐樣。英國在此方向雖沒有海面的塹　以制止之，但德國欲使東南歐巴爾幹牛島諸國所有之石油，礦產，及糧食源源北輸，亦大不易易。第一，德國積欠這些國家大量貨款，迄猶未能淸償，她們自然要求德國償還債款後，才肯以原料及糧食輸予。第二，英法現在正以現金收買巴爾幹半島諸國的貨物，使她們對於德國要求的態度更趨强硬。第三，德國祇能以商品代表現金，而巴爾幹諸國所需者乃係工業原料，而此種原料適係德國所缺乏者。</p>
<p>蘇聯之接濟</p>
<p>德國現在亟亟所爭取的，是原料與糧食。她努力從事於反封鎖，目的亦在解決這兩個因索的取得。德國經數年的準備，糧食或暫時不會發生恐慌，而軍需原料的匱之，却是不可掩的事實。關於自蘇聯取得接濟，也有限度，第一因爲蘇聯主要作戰資源如煤油，蘇聯並沒有多量的出口，可以供給別國。第二蘇聯所需要的是重工業的機器，以便其國內生產建設之用，而德國在這方面，並沒有能力大量供給，來交換蘇聯的原料。所以事實上也沒有多大帮助。再者德國因感到機車缺乏的恐慌，待運之貨物山積。這個因素正足以證明自蘇聯取得接濟也有相當困難了</p>
<p>時人小傳</p>
<h3>活躍在江南戰塲的　陳毅將軍</h3>
<p>— 江荻</p>
<p>陳毅將軍，現在是新四軍第一支隊的司令官，在一年多的歲月裏，他直接負着江南前綫指揮作戰的責任，從艱苦的環境裏，奠定了新四軍游擊戰的基礎，使×人蒙受已大的損失，不能在江南這片錦繡河山裏，任所欲爲，這不能不歸功於陳將軍及他部下的戰士們。</p>
<p>陳將軍是四川樂山人，現年三十九歲，他的家庭，是一個破產的地主，因此他曾受過高等敎育，歐戰後，到法國去留學，牛工半讀，完成了他的學業。就在這幾年裏，他的思想，漸漸蒙受到馬克斯主義的影響，而使他日後走上革命的路綫。</p>
<p>一九二三年，陳將軍學成歸國，回到祖國的懷抱裏，在北京，積極參加文化運動。翌年就正式加入共產黨，擔任國民黨北京市委的工作。後來北伐軍興，因爲陳將軍是叫川人，所以啣着重要的使命回川去和川省高級將領劉湘，楊森等，進行聯絡，響應北伐，直到一九二七年三月重慶事變，川省軍閥開始屠殺革命份子時，才悄然逃往漢口，改任中央軍校的黨委書記。迨至寗漢分裂後，他便一直追隨朱，毛，葉挺等將軍，轉戰沙場，參加幾决驚險的大會戰。在一九三四年六月興圩一役中，他還受過傷，這傷直到現在，還沒有全好。到七七蘆溝橋烽火燃起後，陳將軍認爲報國的機會到了。便到各游擊區聯絡和集中部隊，以備爲國馳驅，後來，決定成立新四軍，他又啣命去把分散在七個省區裏的游擊隊集中起來，加以改編，那時，他就被仟爲第一支隊司令，在前年的　天，開到江南戰塲上來</p>
<p>陳將軍的體格，非常頎長而壯實，雙眉陡峙，樣子是很英挺的，他說話時的嗓音，並不很高，但却很有力量，很有條理，能抓住中心，並且，說話中間，還夾雜着些鬆脆的詞句，使人聽了，一些不感得枯燥。他曾經在某次歷史談判上，說服過一羣頑固的軍閥和官僚。最近，又說服了一個快要變節，而且客觀上很多人說他已經變節的兩面派的人，—一個擁有幾—萬家產的紳士，可知他的口才是很好的。</p>
<p>陳將軍的知識水準很高，所以他文學上的成就，也是多方面的。常常在戰鬥後，寫些小說，散文和詩歌，尤其歡喜的，是寫古體詩。因爲他的題村，都是現實和富有刺激性的，所以博得了多數人的愛好。在某一次內戰中，他在萬分危急的險境裏，做了首「斷頭詩」以打懷抱。詩云：「頸斷此日意如何？創業艱難百戰多，此去泉台集舊部，十萬雄鬼斬閻羅。」他在率部到江南，和×人初次作戰後，亦成詩一絕如上，眞不愧是一位瀟灑的儒將</p>
<p>小常識</p>
<h3>蟹與水災</h3>
<p>— 堯</p>
<p>「蟹與水災」，驟看去似乎漠不相關，聯起來，近乎有些滑稽，可是說起來，實具有至理；據荷蘭水利專家歐勒蒙（VonEnlermon）研究的結果，說蟹和水災，有極重大的關係，原因是蟹常在河堤底下掘罅而居，以致河堤日漸崩潰，結果洪水汜濫，釀成巨災，並謂歷來各國發生水災的主因，即山於此點，換句話說，就是每决發生水災，其禍首都是這「橫行將軍」的蟹。父據考證家言，時代進步了，社會文明了，現在的蟹也比以前的蟹聰明了許多，無論怎樣堅固的河堤，都能使其毀壞崩潰，近年來的水災不時發生，其唯一的原因，也就在此。這眞是我們人類社會之一件可怕的現象。</p>

<p>— 鞠</p>
<p>大多數學校是爲靑年人而創設的，誰曉得世界上有種　爲老人設立的學校。</p>
<p>老人學校，是在美國的阿克拉何馬州，學生將近有一千名，他們的年紀都在七十以上—都是老年而有童心的老頭子</p>
<p>校長的年紀却比學生們小，不過七十許，而學生們在一百歲以上也很多咧！</p>
<p>該校不收學費，唯一條件便是學生須在七十歲以上，才能人學。學校的設備很完全，校長時常對學生們講演，而學生們也常常自動地演講，唱歌，談故事以及各種遊戲。他們自己常將從前的瑣事，滔滔地向大家　述，而引起大家兒時的雋永的回憶。</p>
<p>他們共同的嗜好，是蒔花。看小說。繪圖。研究背樂，各人有各人的樂趣，他們生活得都很舒適。</p>

<p>男子性慾淡薄不一定是病態</p>
<p>常聽見人家說：男子性慾淡薄即是病態。更有人說：男子性慾减退，可以測知其生命之將盡！　抓聳人聽聞的謬論，其目的無非在鼓勵人們去縱慾，爲害之大，甚於刀槍殺人！</p>
<p>我們的論證：男子性慾淡薄，不一定是病態。因爲嬌後的有爲男子，事業的慾望每勝於愛情。或因心性的涵養漸深，或因配偶的不滿其意，對於性慾一事也存漸呈淡薄之感的。但並不是痿弱無能之謂。因爲常美景良宵，興之所至；或是夫婦言歡，逢塲作戲，他必益發的顯其活潑雄偉，旣以歡暢自己的心神，復以慰藉美人深藏在內心中的繾綣而熱烈的恩情。所以此種男子不但無妨於愛情，且有助於愛情永恒地長生！</p>
<p>可是有種男子因早年犯有自凟，遺精，早婚，荒淫縱慾，使生殖腺內分泌液（即精液）大受虧損者，則凡早洩陽痿，發育不全，精力渙散，精薄不育，腎虧腦弱，神經衰弱等症象即不一而足。此種男子每有兩種不同的表現：一因性生活上得不到樂趣，感覺人生厭倦，而陷入悲觀的苦境中，以致性慾淡薄，這當然是病態無疑；二因身虧反而慾吒，在此冬天的漫漫長夜，每頻頻慾試，引起其妻子的興奮，但在眞實的性生活上，反呈曇花一現，或竟完全不能人道。這怎能不引起妻子的憎恨呢？山此夫婦失歡，愛情破裂，而演出私奔，離嬌等種種家庭悲劇者，時有所聞；或竟因症象惡化，形成未老先哀，短命殀殤者亦多不勝計！</p>
<p>患有上述症象，則不可與性慾淡薄混爲一談，必須及早作澈底治療，庶可免嚴重的後患！治療之法：據世界名醫及余等經騐，均以服健壯動物生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」最爲對症特效。因此劑發明最早，監製最精，成分名貴，含有生殖腺內分泌素十字形結品體，腦下垂腺結晶體，及鹿茸精，維他命等多種。所以功效確實，補力偉大，爲任何類似製劑所不及。服後於一日夜間即可生精補腎，健腦活血，連服不斷，則更助長發靑，滋養神經，調整新陳代謝，上述各症必於短期內治愈於無形，並可使精力益增豐足。中老人常服，則益　延年，返老還童！惟患遺精者，須兼服治遺特效藥「希米脫氏問精片」（五洲太和巾西華英等大藥房均售每匣實價兩元）以固精關，制止遺洩，則開源節流，收效允速。</p>
<p>患者李健飛君，湘人，年卅，結婚已十年，患遺精，腦弱，腎虧乏嗣，神經衰弱等症，雖屢服市上成藥，均鮮效果，近且症象惡化，友人促其赴港工作，亦以病阻，焦灼萬分！（以上自訴）上月來本診所診治，經詳察其症狀，知與所言相符，即　其購「生殖素」兩打，希米脫氏固精片」一打，使之兼服，並間日施用電療法，爲時甫及一月，今已百病霍然，面現紅潤，精力豐足，夫婦愛情彌篤，聞將携眷赴港就任新職，則在溫暖而美麗的南國，又添一對甜蜜的情侶矣！</p>

<h3>遺精靑年難享人生幸福</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>誰都知道，遺精是體弱的象微。患有遺精的靑年，若再因循失治，那虧弱的程度勢必加速地增高。最可怕的事，就是山遺精症引起的腦弱和腎虧！</p>
<p>男子體內的精液，好比機器內的機油，可以潤澤各部機能，而使之活潑，性愛的要求，尤其是精液（即生殖腺內分泌）的活動所致。所以熱心地選擇配偶，互談戀愛，進行結嬌，生男育女，組織家庭……開放着人生的燦爛之花，享受着人生無窮幸福！若男子由遺精失治而致腎虧，則必繼起早洩，陽痿；或因遺精使發育機能減弱。雖已成年，而性器織細，仍如童稚；或因精液稀薄，致久婚不育。凡此種種症象，旣難享新婚之樂，更非人生之福，世間靑年，由此而失戀失歡，陷人人世間之慘境者，何可勝數？其由遺精而致　弱失眠，影響於求學與職業，到老來徒傷悲者，或竟短命殀殤者，亦比比皆是！</p>
<p>遺精的特效療法，唯有服「希米脫氏固精片」最有把握。因此藥確能帶固精關，鎭靜神經，服後於常夜即可收安眠止遺之功。惟患者購服時，須認淸「希米脫……」字樣，免爲雜藥蒙混，以致貽誤。至因遺精已有上述症象者，須兼服健壯動物生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以培袖腦腎，精血及神經，連服一月，可使體重增加，精力强壯，百病消滅於無形。患者除服上述良藥外，若能親來木診所兼施電療注射等新療法，更可保證治愈。</p>

<h3>乳峯不美的補救法</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>額上刻着電車道，</p>
<p>雙乳好像　荷包。</p>
<p>此等女性縱打扮，</p>
<p>男子也要把頭搖。</p>
<p>你不要小覷了女人胸前的一對乳峯，它眞有着萬分的魔力與寳貴的價値呢，老實說女性的乳峯如果愈高而愈有彈性，不僅可以把她丰腴的臀部，婀娜的腰身，充分襯托出來，成一條美妙的曲線，使人陶醇愛慕之外。同時由於自身卵巢機能的健全，新陳代謝作用的旺盛，其性情亦無不　良柔順，肌膚無不晶瑩潔白，面頰更無不紅潤而嬌艷。這樣的女郎，不惟在處女時代—也可以說求學時代，因智力品性的超人，可以名列前茅，做一個最優秀的學生，而爲師長親友所愛。即一旦遣嫁而後，憑她這幾個優美條件，做丈夫的，還會不唯命是從，當她活寶一般看待嗎？</p>
<p>可是事實吿訴我們，這樣的女性，亦是最難求，唯一的主要原因，因女子有生理上的諸種差異，如月經，妊娠等。所以每有妙齡年華的女子，額上已刻着許多電車軌道，肌膚粗糙，瘦骨嶙峋，而尤其學得難堪的，一對乳峯，好似兩只乾癟的荷包。此等女性，雖滿塗脂粉，招搖過市，其不爲男子嗤之以鼻者亦幾希？欲謀袖救，祗有從速服以生殖腺卯巢製劑女用「生殖素」最可切實而可靠。蓋乳峯萎　，健美喪失的卞要原因，爲生殖腺卵巢機能受月經不調，白帶不感，多產虧弱，營養不良等症所摧殘，如服女用「生殖素」後，則一日夜間即可培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月經，暖宮止帶，如繼續服用，不特可以根治各症，且能使乳峯高聳，臀部丰腴，紅潤而頗，長駐靑春。</p>

<h3>One Week of War Situation</h3>
<p>Chongqing: A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission said that in the past week, the war situation (13th to 19th) has been more intense in Guangdong and Hubei. The elite Japanese troops in northern Guangdong and Hubei have suffered heavy losses. The Chinese army has also made repeated gains on other fronts. The operational process is described as follows:</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Tensions Rise Again in the Netherlands and Belgium</h3>
<p>The Second European War has been going on for nearly five months, and the main forces of both sides have maintained a poised posture, without engaging in close combat. For Britain and France, this is a war of attrition of military resources. Based on the principle of "steady progress," there is no need to gamble except to intensify the blockade. It is noteworthy that Germany, which has always taken "quick victory" as a shortcut to victory, is also hesitating to launch an offensive easily. It turns out that Germany knows that there is a strong enemy in front of it, and does not dare to take risks. Therefore, it is considering between two paths: whether it should continue to join hands with the Soviet Union in the future, and at the same time develop towards the Balkans, in order to obtain the rich resources of the two sides to supply, and make a long-term deal with Britain and France? Or should it occupy the Netherlands and Belgium first, as a base for attacking Britain and France nearby, so that the war will be easier to end? A quick attack and slow defense, different policies, between choices, must be solemn, so the German army will attack the Netherlands and Belgium, rather than saying that she is bluffing and agitating people, it is better to say that she is exploring the situation and acting on the opportunity.</p>
<p>In recent days, there have been widespread rumors in Europe that because the climate in the Netherlands is severely cold, the effectiveness of the "water defense" plan has been greatly reduced. The German military authorities believe that there is an opportunity to take advantage of it, and plan to implement the offensive strategy decided in November last year again. It is also rumored that both countries are mobilizing urgently, and the situation is extremely tense. Although Germany has many concerns about the Netherlands and Belgium, we believe that there are probably the following factors: First, since Germany has been stationed on the border of the Netherlands and Belgium, the situation has been tight and relaxed, but the army has not retreated; because the Netherlands is indeed an excellent base for attacking Britain and France. If the eastern Netherlands is occupied, the distance to attack the British Isles is greatly shortened, and the transportation of supplies is much more convenient; and attacking Belgium across the Netherlands can only peek at the weaknesses of the Maginot Line, which can pose a great threat to France. Therefore, this plan has never been abandoned. Second, in winter, the weather is cold and the ground is frozen, and the Dutch river surface is very thick, so that soldiers and cars can pass through without hindrance, which is much more convenient than in other seasons. Third, the Soviet Union is trapped in the war against Finland, and the economic and technical negotiations between Germany and the Soviet Union have not yet materialized for a while. Germany's supply to the Soviet Union and the Balkans can be expected but not immediately available, and the "quick victory" theory has therefore reappeared. The cadres of the National Socialist Party strongly advocate it. Although the General Staff opposes speculation and adventure, it may not be able to dissuade Hitler. Fourth, if there is no shocking incident in a short period of time, it will not be possible to give the domestic people a new stimulus and boost their fighting spirit.</p>
<p>Assuming that Germany's attack on the Netherlands and Belgium is realized, its impact will be very worthy of attention. The most important of these is, first, as we have pointed out, if the Netherlands and Belgium are really involved in the whirlpool of war, it is actually equivalent to the outbreak of the Western Front War, and the European war situation will enter another stage. Therefore, the Netherlands and Belgium issue is the key to the European war situation. First, as early as November last year, Italy and Spain notified the German government through normal diplomatic channels, stating that they were very concerned about respecting the territorial integrity of the Netherlands and Belgium. It was also rumored that the initial news of Germany's secret mobilization to this place was secretly notified to Belgium by the Italian side. The Crown Princess of the King of Italy is the Princess of Belgium. According to a dispatch from Paris on the 16th by the Associated Press, the mechanized troops that Germany recently sent to the Dutch border were mostly transferred from Poland. This action shows that the Soviet Union and Germany are now completely colluding and will take joint action against Western Europe and Eastern Europe. There is a contradiction between Germany and Italy, one because of the conflict of interests in Central Europe and the Balkans, and the other because of the irreconcilable enmity of the Soviet Union; however, the axis is about to be abolished, and the national relations are close and far, and it has reached the extreme point so far; once the war between Germany and the Netherlands and Belgium breaks out, Italy will not be able to maintain its ambivalent neutrality, but will have to show its attitude clearly to the world. Third, the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula (i.e., Sweden, Norway, Denmark) and the Netherlands, Belgium, Finland, etc. have the Oslo Commune. Although this is not an offensive and defensive alliance, nor does it have a military meaning, the member countries all yearn for peace, and because of various links in geography, race, history and politics, the feelings are particularly harmonious. The overall interests are all shared. Since the start of the Soviet-Finnish War, the people of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark have expressed sympathy for Finland, and if the Netherlands and Belgium are also among the invaded, the countries will feel even more that if the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold; what is more, Britain and France have repeatedly declared that all countries invaded by Germany are within their aid, and their sympathy for Finland is also very explicit. Therefore, the day when the German army invades the Netherlands and Belgium will be the time when the European War expands. From these three points, it can be seen that the tense situation in the Netherlands and Belgium is by no means a matter in the Netherlands and Belgium, and the impact is related to the overall situation. Continuing to deduce according to the current trend will force the Scandinavian and Baltic coast small countries to unite and form the periphery of Britain and France. By then, except for the chaotic situation in Southern Europe and the Balkans, the outline of the division of power in European countries will be more obvious, and what is doubtful is how long the German-Soviet alliance in the same bed but different dreams can cooperate?</p>
<h3>Pittman Warns Japan to Abandon Hegemonic Policy, Embargo Against Japan Has Won Support from All Sides, Will Be Too Late If Thoroughly Awakened</h3>
<p>Washington: Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman said in a speech today that Japan must abandon its Asian policy, because it is tantamount to Japan's absolute control of China. We sailed ships on the Yangtze River and have obtained more rights than Japan allows in China. If we want to use American assets in China, we also have this right, but now we have to use Japanese assets. Mr. Pittman continued, "Public sentiment is increasingly in favor of the resolution he proposed to ban the export of oil and other exports to countries that violate treaties signed by the United States and attack other countries." (20th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: Representatives of public organizations across the United States who wish to establish legislation to ban exports to Japan are now gathered in Washington, preparing to promote it further after the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation is terminated on January 26. Senate President Pro Tempore Pittman, the drafter of the American Neutrality Act, has already proposed a bill aimed at prohibiting the export of American oil and other export goods to countries that violate treaties signed by the United States and invade other countries. Yesterday, someone asked Secretary of State Hull about this case, but Hull seemed to give an uncertain answer, saying that the case is currently between the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the State Department. (20th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: With the expiration of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation only one week away, US-Japan commercial relations remained at a standstill yesterday. The Japanese side had previously requested the United States to sign a transitional treaty replacing the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. On this point, the Japanese Embassy here still did not receive a reply from the US side yesterday. The State Department declined to comment on this matter. Also, a Japanese official in the sickbed is now trying to meet with Secretary of State Hull next week. At the same time, US Ambassador to Japan Grew will also meet with the Tokyo Foreign Ministry, but everyone believes that there will not be satisfactory results in this short period of time. Senator Pittman told reporters, "The abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation will not have much impact on Japanese businessmen in the United States or American businessmen in Japan. Japanese propagandists are now intimidating American businessmen, saying that all trade will completely stop after the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation is abolished. This report is completely inaccurate. The United States and the Soviet Union broke off diplomatic relations for many years, but the commerce between the two countries continued." Pittman also said the day before that after the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation is abolished, Japanese businessmen can still reside in the United States. (20th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: Japanese Councilor to the United States, Morishima, visited State Department advisor H. Bayard today and spent more than an hour in earnest talks on various issues related to the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. Ambassador Horinouchi also plans to meet with Hull from the State Department as soon as next week to discuss issues relating to the right issue. (19th Allied dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan's Kerosene Needs: 90% Reliant on Foreign Sources; Significant Difficulties Anticipated After Expiration of U.S.-Japan Treaty</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Regarding the impact on Japan's kerosene supply after the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty expires on the 26th of this month, the president of the Japan Kerosene Joint Sales Company, Mr. Tateishi, stated that Japan is not necessarily constrained by the United States. He said, "Our country relies on foreign sources for 90% of its kerosene needs, with only 10% produced domestically. Therefore, after the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty expires on the 26th of this month, we will undoubtedly encounter significant difficulties in obtaining sufficient kerosene from abroad. However, opinions on this matter vary greatly. Pessimists believe that anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States is increasing, and once the commercial treaty expires, the U.S. may prohibit the export of kerosene to Japan. But optimists say that even if the U.S. government takes this action, other countries can purchase kerosene from the United States and resell it to Japan. Furthermore, after the commercial treaty expires, California kerosene companies may see the need to maintain the Japanese market and request government permission to make kerosene an exception, continuing its export to Japan. In his view, Japan's kerosene needs are not necessarily constrained by the United States." (Havas Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Japan Expresses Goodwill to the U.S.: No Discriminatory Taxes on U.S. Imports</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Asahi Shimbun reported today that the Japanese government will issue an important order on the 24th of this month, effective from the 27th, stipulating that after the expiration of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty, Japan will not impose discriminatory tariffs on imported U.S. goods. U.S. goods will continue to receive most-favored-nation treatment. Japanese authorities will also take appropriate administrative steps to protect the rights of Japanese and American residents. This law will maintain friendly commercial relations between the two countries. The U.S. government announced on December 22nd that it would not impose discriminatory taxes on imported Japanese goods, ensuring that the U.S.-Japan commercial relationship would not change in the treaty-less situation after the existing commercial treaty expires on January 26th. Therefore, the Japanese government is issuing the above plan in response. (Reuters Dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Firm Stance: Japan Anxious, As Seen in Public Opinion</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Japan Times commented today on the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty negotiations, saying that Japanese newspapers in Tokyo and Osaka have used strong language in the following comments: "We will not yield to pressure. The U.S. is trying to force us when we are in difficulty. The Japanese people will never forget this," and "The Yangtze River is not yet open. If it is opened for the sake of the U.S., Japan will certainly suffer." The attitude of domestic Japanese newspapers is extremely important at this time. The government learns the opinions of the people, especially those of business leaders, from newspaper commentaries. According to newspaper editorials, Japan is willing to establish a temporary arrangement to continue the usual commercial relationship between the two countries while negotiating a permanent treaty with the U.S. The general opinion in Japan was that its actual actions and dignity in China could be negotiated in an economically amicable way. Unexpectedly, the U.S. is attempting to force Japan to adjust the pending issues between the U.S. and Japan based on Washington's policies. At this point, all Japanese newspapers believe that this is unfair treatment and are becoming resentful, resolving not to make concessions. At present, no practical proposals for adjusting the relationship between the two countries have been heard, apparently waiting for the new government to initiate a plan that will not sacrifice the rights of the people, will not close the door to friendship with other countries, and will not hinder trade relations between the two countries while achieving certain objectives. The government has a great opportunity in this position, but its difficulties are also not few. (Reuters Dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Japan Urges Britain to Change its Attitude Toward China; Military Circulates Leaflet Yesterday Calling for Attention to Three Matters</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Japanese military circulated a memorandum yesterday in various departments, the Diet, and public places, containing three main points: (1) Please pay attention to Japan's military preparations and compare them with those of other military powers. (2) Demanding that Britain revise its policy toward China, otherwise Anglo-Japanese relations will inevitably become strained. (3) Appealing to the entire Japanese people to support the government, overcome the critical juncture, and assist in the implementation of the military expansion plan. (Haitong Dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Chongqing Newspapers Comment on Japanese Political Situation: Attempts at Enticement and Reconciliation are in Vain; the Current Cabinet's Life is Unlikely to be Long</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Today, the newspapers here continue to devote considerable space to reporting on the new Japanese cabinet, paying close attention to it and predicting that Japan, under the new government, may make even greater efforts to entice Chongqing into reconciliation. The "Sweep Away Daily," the organ of the Chinese Army, stated, "Such efforts are bound to fail. Prime Minister Yonai's efforts with Wang Jingwei are hopeless and will only strengthen China's determination to continue resisting." The "New China Daily" stated, "If Yonai's efforts to entice China into reconciliation fail or do not make progress in his impending political offensive, its significance will not only be the collapse of the Yonai cabinet but also Japan's adventure in China will be trapped in an impasse." According to some Chinese observers, Yonai is a fierce opponent of Japan's military alliance with Germany and Italy, while Arita is the initiator of Japan's participation in the Anti-Comintern Pact. However, now that Yonai is Prime Minister, he has appointed Arita as his Foreign Minister. Arita's assumption of this position cannot satisfy the Soviet Union or the United States. It is predicted that the Yonai cabinet will be the last national cabinet appointed by Japan, to be followed by a 100% army cabinet, which will also be the last Japanese cabinet during the current Sino-Japanese War. (Reuters Dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The "Sweep Away Daily," the organ of the Chinese Army, published an article criticizing Wang Jingwei. The newspaper believes that Wang and Yonai are now attempting to end the war against China through propaganda policies and the establishment of puppet political authorities. As for the attitude of the National Government towards Wang, it can be clearly seen in President Chiang Kai-shek's expulsion of Wang from the Kuomintang in December 1938 and the National Government's explicit order for Wang's arrest on January 1, 1939. Yonai has no other way to resolve the war in China except to copy Konoe and Abe's old articles, which shows his skill in wanting to save face. It is precisely because of this that our belief that final victory will belong to us is becoming stronger. If Yonai and Wang can see this point, they should refrain from speaking.

<h3>Japanese Government Considers Budget Cuts</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Tokyo dispatch, according to well-informed sources, the industry has designated February 2nd to explain the cabinet's political program in the assembly, so the government does not intend to make any special announcements before February 2nd. All parties believe that the new cabinet, due to time constraints, will still submit the next fiscal year's budget proposed by the Abe cabinet. However, Finance Minister Sakurai has reportedly planned to reduce the budget as much as possible. In addition, the new cabinet, in order to avoid malignant inflation, high prices, and raw material shortages, has discussed the issue of reducing the next fiscal year's item calculation. After consulting with the Finance Minister and the Army Minister, a new budget proposal may be submitted. (Dispatch, 19th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Diplomatic Frustration: Pro-U.S. and Pro-German Factions in Opposition; Arita's Remarks Send Signals to Axis Powers to Alleviate Resentment from Pro-German Elements</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Upon taking office, the new Japanese Foreign Minister Arita made remarks to reporters, explaining his aspirations. He praised Germany and Italy and expressed his concern for the Anti-Comintern Pact. He said, "Although the Anti-Comintern Pact has been affected to some extent after Germany and the Soviet Union reconciled, it has not been abolished in essence. In terms of the friendly relations between Germany, Italy, and Japan, they are of long standing. Germany and Italy have always been very friendly to our country, and it goes without saying that we should maintain friendship with each other in the future." Since the establishment of the Yonai cabinet, some people originally thought that the Anti-Comintern Pact had come to an end and that the new cabinet would immediately work to promote relations between the U.S. and Japan. Now, upon hearing Foreign Minister Arita's remarks, they cannot help but feel surprised. However, well-informed sources in Japanese political circles said that the real motive behind Arita's remarks is very clear. First, the new cabinet must reiterate the principle of "independent diplomacy" advocated by the Abe cabinet. Therefore, it must maintain a balance between democratic countries and totalitarian countries. At a time when the new cabinet is planning to promote a pro-U.S. policy, it is necessary to send signals to Germany and Italy, especially Germany, so that German newspaper correspondents stationed in Japan can send better "telegrams" to their home country. This is because General Yonai was the person who overturned the plan to conclude an alliance treaty between Germany, Italy, and Japan last year. This time, he formed a cabinet, and the initial reaction from Germany was quite unfavorable. Second, the "pro-German" elements in Japan still occupy a very large force and are closely watching the official expression of the new cabinet. This faction is mainly composed of military figures and those who maintain close relations with the army. They advocated "strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact" last year, but as a result, they achieved nothing due to General Yonai's opposition, thus "losing face." It is difficult for these people to quickly forget their regrets. In addition, this faction may still intend to conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union in the future, so that they can indirectly establish a link with Germany. They are very afraid that General Yonai will come out and obstruct them again in the future. Foreign Minister Arita's praise of Germany and Italy is probably intended to appease these people, so that they will not harbor doubts and oppose the new cabinet. In short, judging from Foreign Minister Arita's remarks, it can be seen that if Prime Minister Yonai wants to approach Britain and the United States in diplomacy in the future, he must be cautious. In other words, he must take into account the powerful pro-German faction in the country, because these people have not forgotten their desire to "restore face" and may still put pressure on the government to accept their views in diplomacy in the future. (Havas Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Regarding the resignations submitted by the cabinet councilors, Prime Minister Yonai met with each councilor individually and tried his best to persuade them to stay. As a result, councilors Suematsu and Matsui have decided to resign. (Allied Dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Prominent U.S. Isolationist Senator Borah Passes Away Suddenly; Known for Eloquence During His Lifetime, He Opposed the Embargo Against Japan</h3>
<p>Washington: Republican Senator Borah, a prominent isolationist, passed away suddenly from a cerebral hemorrhage at 8:45 pm last night (10:45 am Shanghai time today), at the age of seventy-four. Borah had been in a coma since falling in the bathroom on Sunday, so he seemed to feel no pain at the time of his death. (United Press Dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Washington: The death of Republican isolationist Senator Borah is a major blow to Japan's hope of concluding a new commercial treaty to replace the 1911 U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty, which has been terminated by the United States. Recently, Borah opposed the imposition of an embargo against Japan, pointing out that Japan is the United States' best customer and advocating the conclusion of a new treaty to replace the 1911 U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty, which expires on January 26th. (United Press Dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Washington: Republican Senator Borah, a prominent isolationist, accidentally fell at his home on the 16th of this month, causing a cerebral hemorrhage. He was bedridden for many days, and medical treatment was ineffective. He passed away last night at the age of seventy-four. The story of his life is briefly described as follows. Borah's name was William, and he was born in Fairfield, Illinois, on June 29, 1865. In 1890, he practiced law in Kansas. The following year, he moved to Boise City, the capital of Idaho, and continued his old profession. In 1907, he was elected as a Republican Senator from Idaho and has been re-elected every time since then. Among the members of the U.S. Congress, he has always been regarded as a outstanding person. There are three reasons for his success: profound knowledge, straightforward speech, and eloquent debate. Since entering his political career, his main goal has been to attack trusts and large organizations. He often criticized them mercilessly, so he often had conflicts with Republican leaders. During 1936, he once submitted his qualifications as a candidate for the election. Subsequently, he withdrew automatically before the vote of the Republican National Convention. He was known at the time for advocating humanitarianism, adhering to the Constitution, and opposing "militarization." He was also well-known abroad for serving as a member and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for many years. He was also the most vigorous advocate for general disarmament and international peace. Although he strongly opposed the idea of the United States joining the League of Nations during his lifetime, he was still an "internationalist" on all other issues related to American diplomacy. Looking back on his diplomatic activities, his efforts to promote the Washington Naval Conference in 1922 and his opposition to President Roosevelt's resumption of relations with the Soviet Union in 1933 were the most popular. As for his economic views, many famous domestic economists criticized them as being too broad and impractical, saying that the economic plan he advocated was too large in scale and impossible to realize in practice. In recent years, he vigorously advocated isolationism, arguing that the United States should stay out of international events outside of the Americas. Until the outbreak of the European War last year, when Biderman, the current chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, proposed an amendment to the Neutrality Act, advocating the abolition of the arms embargo clause, he tried his best to oppose it, believing that this move would plunge the United States into the whirlpool of war. However, this amendment was finally passed by vote, because the general trend was that the American people, under the leadership of President Roosevelt, deeply knew that events happening in any corner of the world could affect the United States. Therefore, they could no longer agree with the isolationism advocated by this gentleman. (Havas Dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>All Sectors of the United States Express Mourning in Unison</p>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt expressed his condolences on the death of Republican isolationist Senator Borah, stating, "Borah's death is a great loss to American political life. The U.S. Senate and the American people all express mourning in unison. However, we will always remember Borah's indomitable spirit." In addition, prominent figures in American political circles all expressed sorrow over Borah's death. According to Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, "Borah was one of the most important politicians in the United States in this century. When the sad news came, people across the country were in shock and mourning." Secretary of State Hull said, "Borah served the American people for the longest time and was the American politician who most firmly adhered to his personal beliefs and will. Today, America has lost a strong politician." Biderman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said, "Borah was an American politician with strong self-confidence, outstanding personality, and independent spirit. In the Senate, he was one of the few constitutional scholars in America." (United Press Dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Borah's Funeral to be National Funeral</p>
<p>Washington: According to news from here today, the U.S. will hold a national funeral for Borah, probably on Sunday or Sunday, with the ceremony held in the Senate. At that time, President Roosevelt, cabinet ministers, members of the Senate and House of Representatives, and foreign envoys to the U.S. will all participate in the funeral. In addition, the Senate convened at noon today to hear Senator Clark's official announcement of Borah's death. At the same time, from this morning, all public and private organizations and groups here have lowered their flags to half-mast to express their condolences. (United Press Dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>China Loses a Friend; Chongqing Expresses Condolences</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Here, many express condolences for the death of American Senator Borah, recognizing Borah as a "friend of China," because Borah did uphold justice at the Washington Conference. According to Chinese officials here, although Borah was not very familiar with Far Eastern affairs, he was still a friend of China. Therefore, the National Diplomacy Association has sent a telegram to Borah's family to express their condolences. (United Press Dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Chinese officials deeply regret the death of U.S. Senator Borah. Although this isolationist politician recently opposed the United States taking a more active policy in the Far East to prevent Japanese aggression in China, the Chinese have not forgotten that fourteen years ago, Borah, in his capacity as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, advocated the abolition of unequal treaties between China and the United States. It is said that Borah was the first American leader to sympathize with the National Government. Therefore, it is believed that when the Chinese newspapers publish articles of mourning tomorrow morning, they will not criticize his isolationist concept. (Reuters Dispatch, 20th)</p>

<h3>Pope and U.S. President Cooperate; Advocating Peace Movement Based on Justice and Equality; Pope Sends Handwritten Letter to President Roosevelt, Saying that the Strength of the Peace Movement is Increasing</h3>
<p>Washington: The Pope of Rome yesterday sent a handwritten letter to U.S. President Roosevelt, praising his efforts for peace. The letter was personally delivered to President Roosevelt by Archbishop Cicognani, the Pope's representative to the U.S. At the same time, the Pope's letter was also a reply to President Roosevelt's peace call issued on December 23rd last year. According to the Archbishop, President Roosevelt smiled when he received the letter and looked very pleased. He also said that although peace has not been achieved in recent times, a peace movement based on "justice and equality" should be launched and prepared early. According to the Pope's letter, "If the current situation of the belligerent parties does not fundamentally change, then there is little hope for the achievement of peace." After greatly praising Roosevelt's peace efforts, the Pope expressed his willingness to cooperate with the U.S. President to seek the solution of various world problems through peaceful means. The Pope believes that his and the U.S. President's peace calls were coincidentally inspired by heaven. "...Since then, the anti-war, anti-killing, anti-aggression, and anti-threat to human civilization movements in the new and old worlds have increasingly strengthened their strength." (All-China Dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Washington: Pope Pius XII wrote a long letter in response to President Roosevelt's peace proposal, which he sent a few days before Christmas. The contents of the letter first thanked Roosevelt and believed that the letter in spirit was able to coincide with the thoughts, emotions, and hopes of the general public and the class that had sacrificed the most in this war. People's hearts are longing for peace. Once the war stops, there will be a possibility of establishing a true peace that is in accordance with the principles of justice. However, it is necessary to have a highly skilled political power, thoroughly understand the voice of humanitarianism, and those who truly worship the Gospel of Jesus Christ can identify the right path and create a peace that can compensate for the great sacrifices of this war. It also stated, "We fully understand that the current obstacles are not easy to remove. If the belligerent countries' attitude does not change one day, our hope will be difficult to realize one day. However, we firmly believe in peace, regardless of the current difficulties, regardless of the speed of success, we will always work for peace. Therefore, we welcome the important representatives sent by Your Excellency, because they can understand Your Excellency's psychology, bear a major mission, and they themselves have an excellent reputation." The letter concluded by saying, "We sincerely pray for the prosperity of Your Excellency and all the people of the United States." (Haitong Dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>Helsinki: Soviet aircraft again carried out extensive bombing raids in the vicinity of Helsinki yesterday. It is reported that the Soviets only bombed the area near Helsinki and did not bomb the city center. During the bombing, all activities in the city were suspended for two hours. According to Finnish military authorities, Swedish volunteer pilots bombed Soviet bases on the eastern front. It is said that there were as many as 450 Soviet aircraft bombing Helsinki yesterday, but they were repelled as they approached the city center. (United Press dispatch, 20th)</p>

Finland has captured 1,560 live horses and destroyed 63 Soviet field kitchens. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: The Soviet offensive to penetrate Kemikavavi has been repulsed. The Finnish army counterattacked, driving the Soviet troops back several miles. Fierce fighting is currently taking place around Mukikavavi, the outcome of which is yet to be determined. The Soviets are now concentrating their forces to build temporary fortifications along a semicircular front line. The supplies and food for the Soviet troops in this area are better than those of the Soviet troops retreating on other lines. It is expected that they will put up a stronger resistance. It is believed that another extremely important battle is brewing. The strength of the Soviet forces is not known for certain, but military circles here estimate that there are two Soviet divisions in the Sala area. Although they have lost important military advantages due to the retreat, they have gained better transportation to the rear and have received food and ammunition transported along the road they built connecting to the Murmansk railway.

<h3>Norwegian Political Parties Support the Government</h3>
<p>Oslo: The Storting convened today, and Prime Minister Nygaardsvold attended and delivered a speech stating that the government's duty is to avoid being drawn into the whirlpool of war, and it must strictly adhere to neutrality, without taking sides with any belligerent. Although the Norwegian nation has the right to express its feelings, it must do so with caution so as not to harm its neutrality. As far as the current situation is concerned, if our country is attacked, it will certainly do its best to defend itself. If the Storting believes that it is necessary to form a united national cabinet by uniting all parties to cope with the difficult times, the current government is also prepared to do so. Foreign Minister Gulbrand Lunde then spoke, saying that since the outbreak of the war in Europe, our country has experienced various difficulties, especially the mine warfare. So far, our country has lost a total of 28 ships, and more than 100 sailors have been killed. All of this cannot be blamed on any belligerent, but only to curse the war. Our country had previously lodged a protest with Germany, which replied that its submarines had never entered Norwegian territorial waters. In addition, the Soviet Union protested because our country aided Finland. What we have always stated is that the sentiments of our people cannot be suppressed, and relief work does not distinguish between national boundaries. However, our country must still strictly adhere to neutrality, which is also the case in our two neighboring countries, Sweden and Denmark, which are also pursuing the same policy. In short, the cooperation of the Nordic countries has absolutely nothing to do with military issues. The diplomatic authorities of the various countries have already explained this at a meeting held previously in the Swedish capital. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Swedish and Danish Ships Sunk by Submarines; Crew of the "Bayara" Saved; "Duchess of York" Arrives Safely in England</h3>

<h3>Snowstorms Cause Disaster in Various Parts of Europe; Transportation is Disrupted</h3>
<p>London: Snowstorms have caused disasters in various parts of Europe. The temperature in Berlin is about 17 to 43 degrees Fahrenheit below freezing, the coldest winter in decades. Due to the shortage of coal, heating and hot water facilities are extremely rare. In the past 24 hours, there have been heavy snowstorms in various parts of Hungary, especially in Upper Hungary. Many transportation lines have been interrupted. Transportation from Romania to Germany is facing difficulties due to the Soviet occupation of the Polish border and the freezing of the Danube River, so most of it takes the railway through Hungary. Now that there are five feet of snow in eastern Hungary, it is feared that this route can no longer be smoothly used. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>

<h3>British Nation Will Never Tolerate Any Country Dominating Europe; British Foreign Secretary Asks Nationals to Commit All Efforts to the War; Unwilling to Disclose Methods to Aid Finland</h3>
<p>London: Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax recently delivered a speech in Leeds, stating, "We deeply know that in order to win this war, we must use all our strength and greatest determination to achieve success. Our country is a democracy, and private individuals have the freedom to judge and are not restricted by a secret police. This situation may increase difficulties in government preparation and design, but in times of trouble, the government's decisions are known to all the people, and are approved with free judgment and unanimous will, so its strength will inevitably be doubled and overcome everything. This kind of spiritual solidarity has always been despised by Hitler, but it will eventually be the main cause of his failure, because all the burdens of modern warfare, in a justified nation, will naturally be willingly endured, and can never be compared with a nation forced to fight. Previously, in September 1938, various outstanding cases had been resolved by the Munich Agreement according to Germany's claims, but Hitler's ambitions were still clearly visible. It should be known that our nation will never tolerate any country's desire to dominate Europe. This can be seen in history. I dare to resolutely and decisively tell the world today that the British nation's struggle against hegemonic attempts in the past was justified, and in today's situation, it will inevitably become more and more justified. Some say that we can sit idly by and allow Germany to do whatever it wants in Central and Southern Europe. We dare not agree with this view, because even if we disregard morality and sacrifice the freedom of other nations, it will never be the good fortune of the British Empire." (The audience cheered.) "As for the British government's methods of aiding Finland, if they are disclosed, it will actually harm the public interest, but this aid is by no means lip service. This can be told to the people of the country. As far as the threat of German mine warfare is concerned, it has been lifted since the Admiralty implemented countermeasures." (The audience cheered.)

<h3>Italian Cabinet Approves New Budget; National Defense Expenditures Greatly Increased</h3>
<p>Rome: The Cabinet held a cabinet meeting this afternoon, chaired by Prime Minister Mussolini, and approved the budget for the 1940-1941 fiscal year. The total expenditure for the year is 34,895,000,000 lire, and the income is 29,002,000,000 lire. After offsetting the income and expenditure, there is a shortfall of 5,893,000,000 lire. The distribution of national defense expenditures under the expenditure item is as follows: (1) Army 4,231,000,000 lire, (2) Navy 3,350,000,000 lire, (3) Air Force 3,262,000,000 lire, totaling 10,843,000,000 lire, an increase of 2,566,000,000 lire compared to the 1939-40 fiscal year. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>General Trend of Italian Foreign Policy; Significance of Mussolini's Remarks</h3>
<p>Rome: Secretary-General of the Fascist Party, Muti, recently made a statement, saying that Italy's position on the current European war is not immutable. This has been prominently published in various newspapers, and diplomatic figures have commented on it, saying that the outside world is spreading the rumor that Italy will not be drawn into the current European war vortex. Muti's words are intended to dispel this misunderstanding and advise the people not to think that Italy can remain a non-belligerent country for a long time. In addition, since Germany and the Soviet Union established an alliance, Italian public opinion has become increasingly dissatisfied with Germany and has turned to the United Kingdom and France. Muti's remarks are a warning to public opinion and a recounting of the strained relations between Italy and various democracies in the past, in order to prevent domestic public opinion from tending to be biased. The leaders of the Fascist Party believe that how Italian policy should evolve and when it can act must be decided by itself. At present, preparations should be made in the psychological aspect of the people, so that once the time is ripe, the policy can be decided regardless of emotions and move forward. As for the Fascist Party's policy of anti-democracy, anti-Soviet Union, and anti-bourgeoisie in ideology, it is the foundation of the Fascist revolution and should be maintained. This has also been expressed in Muti's remarks. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>French Senate Approves Revocation of Communist Party Members' Qualifications; Cabinet Minister Ydan Delivers a Speech to Vigorously Ban Communist Propaganda Movements</h3>
<p>Paris: The government's proposed emergency motion to revoke the qualifications of Communist Party members was passed by the House of Representatives on the 16th of this month, and the Senate has now unanimously approved it with 294 votes. This case has been established. There are a total of two Communist Party members in the Senate. One of them, Mr. Cachin, was not present today. The other, Mr. Gramaud, had already declared his withdrawal from the party before the government dissolved the Communist Party, so he will still attend as usual today. Before the case was voted on, several senators delivered speeches, strongly condemning the activities of the Communist Party and saying that merely expelling Communist Party members from Parliament is not enough. It is necessary to sever all relations with the Soviet Union, including diplomatic relations, and strictly prohibit the Communist propaganda movement in the country before it is possible to succeed. Then, Cabinet Minister Ydan spoke on behalf of the government, using this to end the debate, stating, "Since the outbreak of the war, the domestic Communist propaganda movement has intensified, which is indeed the case, but the authorities have immediately taken various measures to ban it. As for the government's proposal to revoke the qualifications of Communist Party members, the reason is also very simple, because our country is fighting abroad, and anyone whose attitude is contrary to the sentiments of the people of the country should not be allowed to participate in Parliament. In short, our country's foreign policy will never be constrained by domestic political issues. All measures that the government deems beneficial to the country will be implemented. In addition, our country should give Finland 'the greatest assistance' to resist external forces." (The senators applauded.) "Although our country's diplomatic relations with 'a certain country' have caused some delicate issues, the government is still willing to take full responsibility under the supervision of Parliament."

<h3>President Roosevelt: Radio Address Stresses the Need to Strengthen Democracy</h3>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt, today, delivered a radio address at the "Children of Democracy" conference held at the White House. He stated that the world events that have transpired since the first meeting of this conference at the White House last April have demonstrated that our democracy must be strengthened at every point of tension or weakness. All soldiers wish the country to become a place where their children can live in peace and, upon reaching adulthood, understand their responsibilities to the nation's future. It is essential to know that adequate national defense requires sufficient armaments and war equipment, but even more so, an educated, healthy, and happy populace. (Reuter, 19th)</p>
<h3>Yonai Placed on Reserve Duty; As Usual, Does Not Wear Military Uniform; Now Having New Clothes Made</h3>
<p>Hong Kong – Tokyo Dispatch, according to the "Yomiuri Shimbun," the newly appointed Prime Minister Yonai, on the day of his inauguration, because he had already been placed on reserve duty, should not, as a rule, wear army or navy uniforms. Therefore, he wore his old clothes made thirty years ago. Chief Cabinet Secretary Ishiwata and Director-General of the Legislation Bureau Hirose carefully examined the Prime Minister's old clothes for a long time, and then urged the Prime Minister to have new clothes made. Now the Prime Minister has had new clothes made of artificial wool. (19th)</p>
<h3>Which Is Stronger: Airplanes or Warships?</h3>
<p>American naval historian Rear Admiral Mahan once said that the American Revolutionary War and the Napoleonic Wars, which are generally considered to have occurred on land, were not entirely devoid of naval battles. Furthermore, in many ways, the decisions of victory or defeat, the naval warfare component, was more important than land warfare.</p>
<p>The current European war is naturally no exception. However, in recent years, aviation has made rapid progress, which is completely different from the last European war. The question of which is superior, the air force or the navy, has therefore sparked fierce debate, not only shaking the military but also causing debate in parliament. Many enthusiastic supporters of airplanes insist that the era of warships is over, while supporters of warships equally vehemently refute this theory. The entire argument rests on whether airplanes, upon reaching a point sufficient to drop bombs and bomb targets, can avoid being shot down by anti-aircraft guns, and to what extent the bombs dropped can damage the target. Naturally, the lower the bomber flies, the greater the chance of hitting the target, but the greater the risk of being shot down. Bombing undefended targets at leisure is completely different from dropping bombs in the midst of dense anti-aircraft fire. The more accurate the anti-aircraft fire, the weaker the airplane's aiming ability for bomb dropping. When airplanes practice bombing in peacetime, they cannot hit targets at altitudes exceeding 14,000 feet, but it is heard that the new bombing sights equipped on modern bombers can increase the accuracy of bomb dropping to altitudes of 25,000 feet, a height beyond the reach of anti-aircraft guns.</p>
<p>Another major principle to consider is the extent of the bombing damage. The heavier the bomb, the greater the damage, but there are limits to the load that an airplane can carry. The heavier the load of bombs on an airplane, the smaller its range. It is also necessary to pay attention to what kind of warship is hit and which part of the warship is damaged. The extent to which airplanes can damage warships is still a matter of speculation, although there are exaggerated rumors from the outside world. In fact, no one can provide an answer, which may become clear in this European war. The leading powers in this war, Britain and France, boast of their naval superiority, while Germany prides itself on its invincible air force. Although German airplanes have repeatedly bombed British warships, the results, apart from conflicting messages from both sides, have not provided any reliable information sufficient to reach a satisfactory conclusion. At present, the German air force's offensive is limited to bombing several military targets on the east coast of England and attempting to break through the Anglo-French naval blockade in the North Sea and warships escorting merchant ships.</p>
<p>When an airplane bombs any kind of target, the point of impact of the bombs, regardless of the wind force, usually forms a circle around the target. Other things being equal, the direction of the airplane's attack is usually determined by the outline of the target. For example, when bombing a warship, it is easier to hit it when dropping bombs from the bow or stern. If a fleet is deployed in formation, although there are many targets to be bombed, it is not easy for airplanes to succeed in attacking. This is because while the main battleships in such fleets are easy targets, they are often surrounded by several cruisers and destroyers as satellites, and these warships are all equipped with anti-aircraft guns. The British Navy also has many cruisers, which, in addition to anti-aircraft guns, are not equipped with other armaments. Their mission is specifically to protect the fleet from enemy aircraft. The fleet also includes aircraft carriers, whose deck-mounted aircraft can take off at any time to intercept enemy aircraft. Well-defended naval ports also have anti-aircraft guns and airplanes protecting the fleet on shore. Battleships and cruisers are also equipped with anti-aircraft guns, which can fire four or five-inch shrapnel shells at a very high speed using precision instruments, and can also be assisted by heavy machine guns.</p>
<p>However, if there are dense clouds in the sky, airplanes can take full advantage of them, emerging from the clouds to attack. In this type of attack, by the time the anti-aircraft guns fire, the airplane has already reached above the target, and the bombing is often successful. Airplanes can attack a fleet from all directions, but it is best to attack with the wind, so that the airplane's speed is increased, or by using the sun's glare to confuse the anti-aircraft gunners' aim.</p>
<p>The larger the group of airplanes attacking, the greater the chance of success, because the number of bombs dropped is large, and the increased number of airplanes reduces the concentration of anti-aircraft fire. When bombing in large groups, nine or more airplanes often take turns dropping bombs in batches at different altitudes. Some can use parallel line bombing techniques, while others can attack using a dive-bombing method. A single airplane bombing a single warship is best done with a dive-bombing method. This bombing method is accurate and least likely to be hit by anti-aircraft guns. If the sailors on a warship encounter this situation, if they are quick and agile to maneuver, they can avoid being hit by sharply turning the ship's hull at the appropriate time. It is most difficult for a single warship to encounter two or more airplanes flying from different directions to bomb, because most warships are not very effective in simultaneously opening anti-aircraft fire in all directions. Another effective method for airplanes attacking a single warship is to use machine guns to strafe the sailors or anti-aircraft gunners on the deck.

<h3>Today's Xikang: Beautiful Scenery, Abundant Products; Managing Tibet Should Start with Xikang</h3>
<p>Chengdu Correspondence: Xikang is vast and shaped like a butterfly, being a transverse mountain range region. From north to south, it comprises six major mountain ranges: Shula Mountain, Nu Mountain, Ningjing Mountain, Yalong Mountain, Daxue Mountain, and Qionglai Mountain, forming six major river systems: Yarlung Tsangpo River, Nujiang River, Lancang River, Jinsha River, Yalong River, and Dadu River, creating a naturally beautiful environment. However, due to the transverse nature of the mountain ranges, the entire Xikang is blocked in terms of transportation. Xikang is divided into three major scenic areas west of the Jinsha River: (1) The Zhuola River in Dege County, Jinsha River, winds and meanders, with curved canyons, resembling the Jialing River. Along the mountains, there are lakes that stretch for two miles, with clear blue water surrounded by green pines and cypresses, and snow-capped peaks like white hats. The lush trees on the mountainside are like green clothes. Its beauty can be compared to a Swiss park, with the only missing elements being carved yachts and tourists arm in arm. However, this deficiency can be left for Chinese youth to make up for. Nearby is a gorge, exceptionally magnificent, hence it can be called Snow Gorge. (2) West of Zhuola Mountain is a river gorge with water that seems contented and free, hence it can be named Yi Gorge. (3) Near Zhuola Mountain is another gorge, with walls standing tall at forty meters. The water flows rapidly, with rugged rocks and overhanging cliffs, covered with ancient trees, strange branches winding and twining, and lush forests forming a canopy. The narrowness of the gorge walls makes it difficult to breathe when looking at them, hence it can be called Jun Gorge. From Dege to Baiyu, there are also three mountains, the highest of which is over 1,500 meters. At 400 meters on the mountainside, there is a large lamasery. The entire mountain is covered in knee-deep snow. The secluded and pure scenery cannot be appreciated by ordinary people. Descending from the lamasery is like being surrounded by plants, with pine and cypress branches overlapping, and tree trunks overgrown with parasitic plants. Walking through the green shade, the accumulation of fallen leaves on the mountain path rustles, pleasing to the ear. Emerging from the forest is a vast grassland, as flat as if artificially trimmed. Looking at the towering mountains, white hats and green clothes, rows of trees, the scenery is magnificent. If you rest here, you can see Baiyu County at the foot of the mountain and the rivers surrounding the county seat, like a bird's-eye view from an airplane. If you ride a horse freely from the waist of the lamasery, it takes half a month to reach the foot of the mountain. Therefore, if it is developed into a park, it can be named Baiyu Park. Using it as a summer resort, Mount Lu and Mogan Mountain may not be able to match it.</p>
<p>Social Life</p>
<p>Most men in Xikang do not engage in production. The talented and intelligent all enter lamasery as monks. Ordinary people often carry weapons, which affects social order. The women of Xikang endure hardships in their work and service that far surpass those of women in other places. They are responsible for all tasks, including cultivation, transportation, animal husbandry, and operation. They are truly the most diligent and hardworking women in China. The health and beauty of Xikang women and their open and generous social interactions are also commendable.</p>
<p>The population in various parts of Xikang is abnormally distributed. For example, the Dege lamasery has over 900 lamas, while the people number only about 20 families. Lihua has a population of only over 1,000, while there are over 3,000 lamas. The people have absolute respect for the lamas. Their funerals are divided into four types: sky burial, cremation, water burial, and earth burial, with cremation being the most honorable. They do not like earth burial. As for the extravagance of religion and the degree to which it is deeply ingrained in the people's hearts, it can be seen from the stone tablets carved with Tibetan scriptures everywhere and the people silently chanting scriptures when passing by the stone tablets. The people of Xikang also possess artistic talent and a love for art. The grand murals and carvings in the lamaseries and the prevalence of folk songs and dances all show that the life of the Kang people is not entirely dry and tasteless. The Kang people's diet consists of tea, butter, tsampa, and salt as daily necessities. The Kang people's clothing is loose and long. During the day, they tie their waists with belts to prevent it from dragging on the ground, and at night, they use it as bedding. There are no pockets in the clothes, so all utensils and food can be placed around the waist.</p>
<p>Construction in Various Areas</p>
<p>Construction in Xikang is currently being promoted by the joint efforts of the central and local governments. When Ning and Ya prefectures were not incorporated into Xikang, due to the vast land and sparse population of Kang, all construction could not be planned. Since being incorporated into Xikang, the population has increased sharply, and products are abundant, so construction has begun to be planned and promoted. However, Ya prefecture has more technical personnel and is close to the central government's guidance, with abundant products and relatively better transportation, so promotion is easier. Kang prefecture, on the other hand, has vast land and a sparse population, with a lack of technical personnel. For example, Baiyu County has only two carpenters in the entire county, so it is difficult to keep pace with Ya prefecture in terms of work promotion. As for Ning prefecture, although it has abundant grain to assist Kang prefecture, it is plagued by opium addiction and has a weak physique, so construction is inevitably affected.</p>
<p>Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and Minerals</p>
<p>Tea is the main product of Ya prefecture. Last year's output was 210,000 packages, each weighing 16 kilograms. The export of Tibetan medicinal materials and furs is mostly exchanged for the "border tea" produced in Ya prefecture. However, due to the popularity of Indian tea in recent years, the market is in danger of being seized. Therefore, in order to continue to maintain the existing sales market for border tea in Ya prefecture, to prevent Xikang's finances from losing a source of income, and to ensure that Tibetan native products continue to be exchanged, they are actively working on improving quality, reducing costs, facilitating transportation, and extensively planting. Iron ore is very abundant in Ya prefecture. The Kang people use indigenous methods to extract and refine it, but the results are very good. The output of sulfur, copper, lead, zinc, antimony, agate, and other minerals is also abundant, but the reserves of gold are relatively small.</p>
<p>The mineral resources of Ning prefecture are richest in iron ore, with reserves of 7 to 8 million tons per year, and it is the best magnetite ore. The output of copper, coal, and salt is also abundant. The gold reserves far exceed those of Ya prefecture. There are four large-scale gold mines, and the locals say they "measure gold by the bucket." Kang prefecture is most prosperous in gold production. The Yalong Tsangpo River basin in Ya prefecture is particularly rich in reserves. In addition, the reserves of copper, lead, and other minerals are also abundant. Animal husbandry is particularly prosperous in Kang prefecture. Each county has hundreds of cattle farms, with dozens of cattle on each farm, especially in Shiqu County. Except for the fixed houses of the county government, everything else belongs to livestock tents. Therefore, the output of milk, butter, and furs is extremely high. The forests of Kang prefecture are most lush in the Jinsha River basin. Trees that require two people to embrace are everywhere. However, because the forests obstruct animal husbandry, the locals have even burned them all down, which is truly regrettable. If they could be used for papermaking, the entire demand for paper in Xikang would not be a problem. It is deeply regrettable that the Kang people use the oldest methods for papermaking, and each family can only produce a few dozen sheets of paper a day. This precious natural resource needs to be developed and utilized. In addition, the oil in Ningjing Mountain also has large reserves.</p>
<p>Water conservancy is a natural source of profit for the entire Xikang. The difference in the steepness of the six major river systems is 2,000 meters. The 60-mile waterway near Kangding can generate 100,000 horsepower, and the electricity that can be generated is more than 70,000 kilowatts. If the water power of the entire Xikang is used to power factories, the benefits cannot be calculated by numbers. Moreover, because Kang has no coal production, it is particularly suitable to use water power to compensate for this deficiency.</p>
<p>Transportation Issues</p>
<p>It is generally believed that Xikang is mostly mountainous, but in reality, there are many plains. Therefore, the Sichuan-Kang Highway and the Kang-Xin Highway should be urgently constructed. However, the transportation in the Jinsha River basin should not be ignored. This is because Xikang's transportation relies entirely on "Ula" (a Tibetan term meaning duty, where local people take turns supplying horses and personnel for travel and transportation). However, from Kangding to Ba'an, the "Ula" system is extremely bad. Ba'an's fruit production is exceptionally abundant, and its grapes and apples are comparable to those of the United States. If this section of the waterway is developed, the water flow will be stable, and transportation will be rapid. All medicinal materials, furs, and fruit plants can flow downstream, greatly benefiting the Kang people's economy.</p>
<p>In addition, there are two other points that are sufficient to value Xikang: (1) Xikang is a bridge between Han and Tibet. If Xikang is not developed, there is no way to manage Tibet. (2) Tibet has an international role. Because sea transport is cut off, it is necessary to rely on land transport in the rear. Xikang can enter Yunnan via Zheng'an Yanjing and Deqin, and can also reach India and Singapore from Yanjing through Chayu to Ledo. The importance of Xikang is as described above, but we cannot be optimistic because of this, so it is urgent to develop it. Secondly, today's management of Xikang cannot expect immediate results. We must have the determination to fight hard in the long term and do things step by step in a down-to-earth manner. The large number of technical personnel needed depends on the youth's enthusiastic dedication.</p>

<p>After the Shanghai Fair Price Committee decided to commission the Rice Shops Association to designate 100 rice shops in the two concessions to carry out fair price sales starting today, a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday visited Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Chairman of the Committee, at the Committee's office. He was privileged to receive the following statement:</p>
<p>Yu stated:</p>
<p>The Original Intention of Fair Price Sales: Since the rice shortage in this city, various parties have devised relief measures. In addition to major factories, businesses, and guilds devising relief or subsidies for their employees, middle-class families can still manage to maintain themselves with effort. The most miserable are the poor who live day by day on small amounts of rice. This is the original intention of this Committee to actively conduct fair price sales in order to provide relief. The broken rice purchased by this Committee this time is produced in Saigon. Only the rice grains are slightly broken, and the quality is equal to other Saigon rice.</p>
<p>Fair Price Rice Price: The cost of the rice purchased by this Committee, calculated including handling charges, is $35.53 per bag, plus expenses, weighing approximately one hundred pounds, totaling about $37 per bag. Now, it is being sold at six and a half catties per dollar, which is about one and a half cents per catty (i.e., $25 per stone), earning $30.07. As such, this Committee will lose about $6.10 per bag. Yu also stated that for this fair price sale, members of the Rice Shops Association are still allowed to expand the scope and conduct it completely voluntarily, according to the fair price sale method entrusted by various groups for the first time, which is deeply appreciated. Various industries and individuals have enthusiastically donated and pledged donations, allowing the Committee to proceed unimpeded.</p>
<p>Automatic Donations: For example, yesterday, Zhao Faji personally donated $5,000 to Jin Cheng Bank. Today, Cun Xin Tang personally donated $10,000 to the Shanghai Bank. Other miscellaneous donations, such as from anonymous individuals, are also quite enthusiastic, showing great zeal, which is deeply admired. It is hoped that all sectors will continue to provide assistance, and deep gratitude is expressed to the police authorities of the two concessions for their willingness to provide their best efforts to maintain order. It is also hoped that the civilians who go to the various rice shops to buy rice will maintain order. Fortunately, the scope of this fair price sale has been expanded compared to before, and the time is also longer, making it easy to popularize.</p>
<p>Implementation Today: The Rice Shops Association accepted the commission and designated 100 member rice shops to conduct fair price sales, including 30 in the Public Concession and 20 in the French Concession. One shop in each location will issue rice, and another will sell tickets. Starting at 1:00 PM today, under the protection of the police detectives, fair price sales will be implemented. Each location will sell 50 bags per day, until 6:00 PM. Yesterday, the Fair Price Committee withdrew 2,500 bags of fair price rice from the warehouse and distributed them to the 50 rice shops issuing rice. The rice ticket style is "Shanghai Fair Price Committee Fair Price Rice Ticket," with the "Date" and "This ticket is good for one dollar's worth of broken rice" noted, along with "Not applicable elsewhere, invalid the next day" and "Location 〇" printed.</p>
<p>Change to Measuring Instruments</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fair Price Committee specially announced yesterday: "For the purpose of notification, the original method for this Committee's fair price sale of broken rice was to use specially made funnel-shaped lead cylinders with a one-dollar capacity, stipulated as one cylinder per dollar, suitable for six and a half catties per dollar. Now, after the lead cylinders were made, the capacity was found to be inconsistent." It was decided to change to using the steel standard measuring instruments made by the "Shanghai Rice Shops Trade Association," selling two liters per dollar, which is six and a half catties per dollar. This is specially announced again so that everyone knows.</p>
<p>Group Rice Purchases: After the Shanghai People's Food Regulation Association handled the registration of group orders for foreign rice, the various groups, organizations, companies, and factories that entrusted the Association to order foreign rice have paid deposits for more than 14,000 bags. In addition to ordering the first batch of 600 tons of Saigon No. 2 foreign rice that has arrived in Shanghai, the Executive Directors approved yesterday that the Purchasing Committee will telegraph tomorrow to continue ordering a second batch of 800 tons from Saigon. It is also stipulated that only Saigon rice No. 2 will be purchased for group purchases. For the first batch of foreign rice, Jin Cheng Bank has advanced funds and is in the process of handling the shipment formalities.</p>
<h3>Kato to Fly to Japan; One Week Stay</h3>
<p>Japanese Special Envoy Kato, after arriving in Shanghai last year, has been here for almost half a year. Kato flew to Peiping on December 15th last year to meet with the American Ambassador, but returned to Shanghai after Dr. Johnson's quiet departure. After the American Ambassador arrived from Qinhuangdao on the warship Henderson, Kato went to the Ambassador's office on the morning of the 18th to meet with him, and left after a conversation of about 20 minutes. Kato then flew back to Tokyo in the afternoon to report to the new cabinet. It is learned that Kato will stay in Tokyo for a week before returning to China.</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary and First Lord of the Admiralty to Broadcast to Shanghai; Listening Time 9:15 AM</h3>
<p>According to news from the British Consulate in this port, British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax is scheduled to deliver a speech to overseas audiences at 2:35 PM on the 20th on the BBC. The listening time in Shanghai is 10:35 PM on the 21st. First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill will also broadcast on the same day at 9:15 PM. The listening times in Shanghai are 1:15 AM, 8:15 AM, and 1:30 PM on the 21st. The listening times in Shanghai are 9:15 AM, 4:15 PM, and 9:03 PM on the 21st.</p>
<h3>Friends of Finland in Shanghai Donate Funds to Aid War Effort; Total Donations of $25,000</h3>
<p>Since Finland resisted the Soviet Union's mighty army, the Friends of Finland in Shanghai have launched a fundraising campaign to express their sympathy. According to reliable sources, as of the evening of the 19th, the amount donated to Helsinki, the capital of Finland, is worth approximately $25,000 in national currency. Among them, $7,500 is specifically designated to be donated to the Finnish Red Cross for relief purposes, and another $17,500 is donated to Finland's defense war expenses.</p>
<h3>Dutch Ships Increase Sailings to Singapore</h3>
<p>Sailings to the Nanyang Islands have been mostly operated by Dutch and British ships, especially to Singapore, where commerce is flourishing and the population is increasing rapidly. British ships traveling to and from the island have always been frequent. It has been learned that since the outbreak of war in Europe, British ships sailing to various parts of Nanyang have been affected by the difficulties in European navigation, and the number of sailings has been reduced at one point. In the past month, after British and French ships have been attacked by belligerent countries in various places, the British side, considering that sailings in the Far East are also dangerous, has suspended sailings one after another in order to avoid accidents. Therefore, there are few British ships currently sailing to the Nanyang Islands. Ships in Singapore have gradually been replaced by Dutch mail ships. It is heard that the Singapore authorities have an agreement with the Dutch shipping company regarding the operation of Dutch ships to the island. Before the outbreak of war, there were about 50 Dutch ships operating on the Nanyang routes. Since the outbreak of the European war and the suspension of British ships, the number of Dutch ships has increased frequently. According to recent statistics, there are now more than 100 ships, which is an unprecedented phenomenon.</p>
<h3>Three Japanese Airplanes Bomb Lishi; The Airport There Had Already Been Destroyed; Meaningless Bombing by Japanese Airplanes</h3>
<p>According to a telegram received by the aviation community last night, three Japanese airplanes flew in formation to Lishi outside the South Gate of Ningbo on the afternoon of the 19th and bombed it, dropping a total of 24 bombs. One farmer was injured, but there was no other damage.</p>
<p>Airport Destroyed</p>
<p>It is investigated that Lishi outside the South Gate of Ningbo had an airport before the outbreak of the War of Resistance. After the outbreak of the war, Japanese airplanes constantly flew to bomb it. Later, in the winter of last year, the Ningbo authorities, on orders from higher authorities, thoroughly destroyed the airport, covered it with earth, and handed it over to farmers for cultivation. The residents of Lishi Town were also evacuated. Therefore, it is meaningless for Japanese airplanes to bomb it again this time.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Bomb Zhenhai Again</p>
<p>According to an investigation by a Datong News Agency reporter, after four Japanese warships shelled Zhenhai in two shifts on the 16th, they did not shell it on the 17th. On the afternoon of the 18th, they were still in the Longshan and Xiepu areas. After shelling, the Japanese warships sailed away from the Zhenhai port, beyond the range of the beacon mouth. The garrison troops are still on high alert to prevent them from committing further offenses.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Director-General Fessenden's Resignation Rumors Untrue, Scheduled to Leave Shanghai This Afternoon for Singapore on Vacation, Extraterritorial Road Negotiations Still Unresolved</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that Public Works Department Director-General and President Fessenden is scheduled to leave Shanghai this afternoon for a short vacation. During his absence, the duties will be temporarily assumed by Deputy Director-General Mr. Gobbett. Mr. Fessenden yesterday refuted rumors broadcast by a Shanghai radio station stating that he would resign and not return to Shanghai, saying, "I have never intended to resign. I will leave Shanghai for Hong Kong and Singapore on Sunday (today) for a</p>
<p>Three-Week Vacation.</p>
<p>I have not had a vacation for over a year." Regarding the negotiations between the Public Works Department and the Shanghai "Municipal Government" on the issue of extraterritorial road construction in western Shanghai, there has been no concrete new progress. Important issues such as police affairs and tax collection are still under discussion, and a specific plan has not yet been agreed upon. It is expected that no resolution can be reached before the Lunar New Year. The report in a certain morning newspaper yesterday that a joint police agency would be established in the extraterritorial road construction area is</p>
<p>Completely Groundless,</p>
<p>and likely to cause misunderstandings. Furthermore, the Shanghai Times reported that a senior official of the Public Works Department stated yesterday that the public should not pay attention to unofficial information regarding the negotiations between the Public Works Department and the Shanghai "Municipal Government." Unless the Public Works Department and the Shanghai "Municipal Government" have reached a complete agreement on this matter, neither party will</p>
<p>Disclose</p>
<p>any information. This is a policy that both parties have adopted since the beginning of the negotiations and will continue until a final agreement is reached. The negotiations are proceeding as usual, and although complete understanding has been reached on some issues, their content cannot be disclosed.</p>
<h3>US Ambassador Johnson to Travel to Hankou by Ship Tomorrow, Purpose of Inspection is to Investigate the Current Situation on the Yangtze River, Reason for Not Opening Beyond Hankou</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reports that US Ambassador Johnson, who arrived in Shanghai on Thursday, told reporters that his trip to Hankou was like a "temporary tourist" and had no significant meaning. However, according to information gathered this morning (20th), the Ambassador is scheduled to travel up the Yangtze River on the US gunboat Luzon on Monday morning with Rear Admiral Glassford and his staff. People in Shanghai believe that Ambassador Johnson's trip will be to inspect the current situation in the area and investigate why it should not be opened beyond Hankou. During the inspection, he will be assisted by his staff, including his personal secretary Mr. La Fong, Naval Attaché Commander Offley, Military Attaché Major Meyer, and Assistant Naval Attaché Major McHugh. He is expected to return to Shanghai in early January. The US gunboat Wake will also accompany him, replacing the current US gunboat Guam stationed in Hankou. The Guam is scheduled to return to Shanghai on February 6.</p>
<h3>Outside Yanglinkou, the New Jiangnan Ship Sinks, New Asia Ship Collides on the Side, Damaging the Starboard Side, Crew Members Killed and Injured, Engine Room Flooded</h3>
<p>The New Jiangnan, a ship of German company Reis &amp; Co., represented by Fu Hwa Steamship Company, which sails the Shanghai-Tianshenggang route, left Shanghai for Tianshenggang at 1:30 PM the day before yesterday. At around 5:00 PM, when it arrived outside Yanglinkou, it was sunk by the New Asia, a ship of Japanese company Toa Kaiun Kaisha. Two crew members died, and two were injured. The casualties of passengers are unknown. Rescued crew members and passengers arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The New Asia Ship Collided from the Rear Side.</p>
<p>The New Jiangnan has a gross tonnage of 157 tons and a length of 106 feet. It belongs to German company Reis &amp; Co., represented by Fu Hwa Steamship Company at 113 Jiujiang Road, specializing in the Shanghai-Tianshenggang route, mainly for cargo and passenger transport. It used to sail the Shanghai-Beisha route. The ship left Shanghai directly for Tianshenggang at 1:30 PM the day before yesterday, without cargo, only carrying more than 40 passengers, preparing to load a large amount of cargo in Tianshenggang and return to Shanghai. At 5:00 PM, when the ship arrived outside Yanglinkou, the Dahua ship was sailing on its front side, and the New Asia, a ship of Japanese company Toa Kaiun Kaisha, was loading cargo in Wuhu and heading to Shanghai, was on the rear side of the Dahua ship. After the New Jiangnan crossed the Dahua ship, the New Asia Ship collided fiercely with the New Jiangnan, and the New Jiangnan, being a small ship, was damaged on the starboard belly.</p>
<p>The Ship Sank, Passengers Rescued.</p>
<p>After the New Jiangnan was hit, the engine room inside the ship was flooded, and it sank completely in about an hour. The crew and passengers were rescued by the New Asia Ship, and a total of about 100 crew members and passengers were rescued and transferred to the New Asia Ship. They arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and berthed at the No. 31 buoy in Yangshupu. After receiving the news, Fu Hwa Company sent the Mito (transliteration) small ship, led by German manager Du Nasui, to Yangshupu to welcome them. They landed at around 11:00 AM. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from Fu Hwa Company yesterday that after the New Jiangnan was sunk, the company reported the collision and the report of the captain Lu Hexiang to the German company Reis &amp; Co. It has now been confirmed that one crew member (cook) Zheng Afu has died, and (tea server) Wang Moufang and (engineer) Liu Aqing were injured and sent to Renji Hospital. After examination, the injuries are still minor and not life-threatening. The casualties of passengers are unknown, but there are probably no deaths or injuries.</p>
<p>The Company is Taking Measures to Deal with the Aftermath.</p>
<p>There were about 27 crew members on the New Jiangnan Ship, more than 20 staff members in the comprador room including tea servers, and about 20 workers, totaling about 60 people. There were about 40 passengers this time, totaling over 100 people. All the luggage and bedding of the rescued crew members have been lost. The company is taking measures to deal with the aftermath. The hull was insured with the North American Insurance Company, and Reis &amp; Co. and the insurance company are taking measures to salvage it.</p>
<h3>Consular Court Judges for This Year</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department recently received a notice stating that the judges for this year's Consular Court have been appointed: US Consul General Gauss (concurrently as Chief Judge), Japanese Consul General Miura, and British Consul General George. Mr. Qi will continue to serve as Secretary.</p>
<h3>County Government Agencies in Neighboring Counties are Becoming More Sound.</h3>
<p>The eight counties bordering Shanghai's four suburbs are Shanghai, Chuansha, Nanhui, Fengxian, Jiading, Baoshan, Qingpu, and Songjiang. In January of last year, the Jiangsu Provincial Government selected and appointed legitimate county magistrates to each county one after another. The military salaries of the guerrilla army are also paid by the legitimate county governments one after another. Therefore, local national taxes can be collected separately by county government personnel, eliminating the practice of the guerrilla army collecting military salaries locally. The military and civilians are all rejoicing.</p>
<p>Restricted by the Environment, Taking on a Mobile Nature.</p>
<p>The Japanese and puppet sides regarded the county government agencies in the war zone as a thorn in their side and tried to send spies disguised as villagers to the countryside to investigate the location of the county government and then used military or other methods to carry out sabotage. Therefore, for a period of time, the county government agencies, restricted by the environment, changed to a mobile nature, with all shifts depending on military power. At the same time, they strictly arrested spies who secretly engaged in sabotage work. After repeatedly arresting spy-type criminals, after clear interrogation, they were executed to deter them.</p>
<p>County Government Agencies are Becoming More Sound.</p>
<p>At present, in the Jiangnan war zone, the Chinese mobile troops are actively recruiting and replenishing their forces, and the Japanese dare not use force to suppress them again. In places far from the Japanese-occupied areas, the county government has changed from a mobile to a fixed nature. Although the county government buildings do not adhere to formal aesthetic standards, the office agencies have gained a stable position and can no longer be destroyed by the Japanese and puppets. The Japanese know the location of several counties such as Fengxian and Songjiang, but they dare not easily invade. Therefore, the county government agencies in each county are becoming more sound.</p>
<h3>Silver Ear Fungus Transported to Shanghai, Certificate Exempts Remittance and Allows Release.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from the Ministry of Economic Affairs yesterday, stating that "the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, we have received your telegram, stating that the silver ear fungus transported to Shanghai has been detained, please transfer and instruct to release it according to regulations. After transferring the telegram for verification, the Ministry of Finance has approved this year's December Dianyu Zidai telegram, stating that this article has been telegraphed and instructed Kunming to verify the purchase order from the merchant in the destination of the transfer certificate, and the certificate from the trade association, exempting remittance and allowing release. This is hereby notified for your information.</p>

<h3>British-American Barter Trade, Carried by US President Lines, US Cotton Shipped to Britain, Britain Supplies Rubber to the US</h3>
<p>The American President Lines (formerly reorganized as the Dollar Steamship Lines), after the August 13th Sino-Japanese Incident,</p>
<p>The Sino-US Route was Greatly Affected and Suspended. After the reorganization in early November 1938, the Sino-US route was restored (but is still only one-way). Recently, the world-class passenger ships have resumed calling at Shanghai and Taiwan. The first ship, President Garfield, will arrive in Shanghai on February 13. The company has made great efforts to expand its shipping business. Since the outbreak of the European war, some of the goods shipped from Shanghai to Europe have been shipped to Europe by the US. Therefore, Sino-US shipping has</p>
<p>Suddenly Prospered, and even European-American transportation is several times more profitable. It is also heard that the company has recently opened a new route from New York to Singapore, specializing in carrying British-American barter trade. The United States supplies cotton to Britain, shipping cotton from New York to Singapore for delivery. Britain supplies rubber to the United States, carrying rubber from Singapore back to New York. It has now been opened. Therefore, the company's original ships are insufficient for scheduling and operation. Recently, it has leased several large-sized "Maler" ships from Reis &amp; Co. and is managing the ships of the American Pioneer Line, adding them to the operation.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Replies to Chamber of Commerce, No Prohibition on Sales of Shanghai Goods, But Certification Still Requires Careful Review</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously received the list format of national goods certification issued by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Since then, domestic goods from national goods factories in the two special zones and safety zones in Shanghai have been transported internally, and the association fills out and issues certification forms. Customs offices in the interior release goods based on the forms. While careful processing was underway, it was later seen in the newspaper that the Ministry of Economic Affairs had said there was a prohibition on the domestic sale of Shanghai goods. An urgent telegram was sent to inquire, and yesterday a telegram was received in reply, stating, "The written telegram has been received. Regarding the section reported in the Shanghai newspaper, this ministry has no such regulation. Please notify the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Chongqing."</p>
<h3>Verification and Release Based on Chamber of Commerce Certification, Products of Shenxin and Wing On</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government telegraphed the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating, "Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, greetings. We have recently approved a telegram from the Ministry of Economic Affairs stating that although Shenxin No. 2 and No. 9 factories and Wing On No. 3 factory have not been designated for prohibition, the trademarks they use are the same as those used by the designated prohibited products of the factories of the two companies. We have previously instructed them to differentiate them. However, before the differentiation plan is submitted to the ministry for approval, all products of the three factories should be certified by the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce as being products of the factories before verification and release." In addition to separate telegrams for compliance, please be informed and instruct compliance. Zhejiang Provincial Government Jia Mi Er Jian Yin.</p>
<h3>German Ship Chinese Crew Refuses to Return Home on Japanese Ship</h3>
<p>The more than 350 unemployed crew members who returned home on the Italian postal company's ConteVerde on the 18th and arrived in Shanghai have now been staying at inns around the 16th pier of Xinkaihe. According to the Datong News Agency reporter, they were originally from Yongjia, Qingtian, Ruian, Zhoushan, and Yinxian in Zhejiang Province. They served on German merchant ships "Gula," "Harigalaland," and "Portland," working as firemen, sailors, servants, painters, and carpenters, for more than ten years. Since the outbreak of the Second European War, the three ships were ordered to stop sailing and were anchored in the neutral port of Chile in South America. Since there was no prospect of resuming sailing, the company made arrangements to dismiss them, paying each person a severance payment equal to several months' salary (the average monthly salary per person was about ten US dollars).</p>
<h3>The Lunar New Year is Approaching, All Sectors are Promoting Military Appreciation and Disaster Relief, Uniformly Implemented Starting from the Lunar New Year</h3>
<p>All sectors in Shanghai, led by the National Comfort Association, are initiating a campaign to save expenses during the Lunar New Year, shift the focus of gifts, and comfort the soldiers fighting in the war of resistance. It has been decided to uniformly implement this starting from February 10th (the first day of the Lunar New Year), sending the savings to the National Bank, which will then be transferred to the Comfort Association to provide comfort to the soldiers in various war zones. In addition, according to Shanghai customs, every year when the Lunar New Year approaches, middle and upper-class families prepare New Year's meals, invite relatives and friends, and visit each other, which costs a great deal. At this time of high prices and precarious livelihood for refugees, various charitable organizations hope that all sectors can save this expense and donate to help refugees to fulfill their duty of mutual assistance. Many charitable people in Shanghai will be able to promote this to benefit the disaster victims.</p>
<h3>National Goods Manufacturers to Discuss Today, Straits Settlements Prohibition, Shanghai Goods Sales to Southeast Asia Reach 2 Million Yuan Daily, Affecting Local Industry and Commerce Significantly</h3>
<p>The British Straits Settlements government issued a ban on goods from non-sterling countries on November 17 of last year, while goods from sterling countries were not prohibited. Shanghai was included in the list of prohibited countries, restricting the import of 76 types of goods and prohibiting the import of as many as 236 types of goods. The products manufactured by Shanghai factories that are shipped to Southeast Asia reach 2 million yuan daily. This will inevitably suffer a serious blow in the future. In order to appeal to the Straits Settlements government to withdraw its order, the national goods factories have decided to convene a joint meeting of representatives of national goods factories today. At that time, coping measures will be discussed. A notice has already been issued, stating, "Greetings. Having read the newspaper report that the overseas national goods inspection representatives Gao and Wang sent a letter reporting that in order to strengthen foreign trade, the British Straits Settlements government has issued a ban on the import of goods from non-sterling countries. Once implemented, the national goods industry in this city will suffer a serious blow. For this reason, a joint meeting of representatives will be held at 3:00 PM on the 21st of this month on Edward Road. At that time, please send representatives to attend the meeting on time and discuss matters." Negotiated with the company to take a Japanese ship via Japan from Santigoo port for dispersal, but they deeply understood the righteousness of the nation's vigorous resistance against Japan and were unwilling to take the ship. They pushed for representatives to negotiate with the responsible persons of various ships, and finally changed to take the Italian postal Olacchiwo to the port of Genoa in Italy, and returned home via ConteVerde. Now, they all plan to wait for the ship to return to their hometown, and some of them traveled to Ningbo via Haifu yesterday to stand guard over their homes, waiting for the end of the war, and then the leader will gather them to go abroad to serve.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Tramways Company, Expired Fare Vouchers, Cannot Be Used as Fares Anymore, Can Be Redeemed at Designated Locations</h3>
<p>Due to the shortage of fractional currency, the Shanghai Tramways Company previously issued copper two-cent, nickel four-cent, aluminum two-cent, three-cent, and five-cent tokens. In December and January, two-cent and five-cent fare vouchers were issued. The December vouchers were originally scheduled to be used until January 10, but were then allowed to be used due to requests from all parties. The company now allows expired fare vouchers to be exchanged for cash. Its notice states, "The December fare vouchers issued by this company will be invalid from midnight on January 20. These December fare vouchers cannot be used as fares, but can be redeemed at the company's offices at 111 Sassoon House or at the main factory at 1171 Connaught Road. At a time when fractional currency is scarce, please refuse to accept the ten-month fare vouchers given by ticket sellers. Your assistance would be greatly appreciated. The ticket sellers have sufficient January 1940 fare vouchers, so passengers must not accept used fare vouchers."</p>
<h3>The Xin Yi Fang Rent Increase Case Should Await Legal Resolution</h3>
<p>The French businessman Picault &amp; Cie wanted to increase the rent for the Xin Yi Fang on Rue Cardinal Mercier by 15% and 10% respectively on December 1, 1937. Now the same business wants to increase rent by another 20%. The 18 tenants unanimously refused the rent increase and reported to the Department of Political Affairs of the French Municipal Council, requesting the rent increase. Yesterday, the Department of Political Affairs summoned tenant representatives Liu Guang and others to persuade them to increase the rent. Liu Guang and others said that everything is expensive, the people cannot make a living, and they cannot afford it. They also entrusted lawyer Cheng Zhengping to send a letter to the Department of Political Affairs explaining the situation of repeated rent increases, and they have received a summons from the court to wait for a legal solution. This is a civil matter and should not be accepted.</p>
<h3>Stock Shortages to Defraud Goods, Proprietor of Sock Factory Flees, Shops Form United Prosecution</h3>
<p>Zhu Gengru, the owner of the Huaxin Zhengji Sock Factory at 18 Route Tenant de Belleville, recently thought of a plan due to stock shortages. At the beginning of this month, he defrauded goods worth more than 1,800 yuan from Xin Taihao, Xie Feng National Goods Company, Modern Chemical Industry Company, and Central Chemical Industry Company, using term checks from the Kenyeh Bank as a perfunctory excuse. On the 6th, he closed the store and fled. After hearing the news, Xin Tai and other merchants jointly hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Second Criminal Court, accusing Zhu Gengru of issuing bad checks. Based on the complaint, Judge Zhu of the court opened the second criminal court yesterday to hear the case. Because the defendant's address was unknown, there was no way to issue a summons. The court ordered a postponement to the 25th of this month for retrial.</p>
<h3>The American Church in Longzhou Was Destroyed, The Japanese Army Evades Responsibility, Claiming that It Was Set on Fire by the Chinese Army, While the French Church in Qinzhou Was Safe</h3>
<p>The China Press reports that the Japanese military spokesperson yesterday (19th), at a reception for journalists, denied the protests from the United States and France regarding the destruction of churches in South China last month. According to reports, the Japanese side received a protest on the 10th of this month, stating that on the 21st of last month, the Japanese army had plundered the American Christian Church in Longzhou, Guangxi, which flew the American flag, and burned it the following day. According to the Japanese military, the claim that the church was plundered by the Japanese army is not true. The church was set on fire by the Chinese army at the end of last month when the Japanese army approached Longzhou. The Japanese authorities have sent a reply to the American authorities. The Japanese side also received a similar protest from the French authorities regarding the burning of a French church near Qinzhou, Guangdong. In fact, the church buildings and the 300 refugees cared for by the church were all safe and protected by the Japanese army.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Child Protection Work for 1939</p>

<p>In December of the year before last, the Director of the Industry Department of this Bureau submitted a report on the issue of female servants through the Bureau to the Consular Body, requesting it be forwarded to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations for reference by the League of Nations Slavery Committee. This report stated that the so-called "female servants" were merely one type of women separated from close relatives and employed by other families. Other groups such as adopted daughters, child brides, and countless young female workers were also under the control of others, serving in their households. Furthermore, there were a large number of young girls often transferred by their own parents, leading to their bondage, though not necessarily working in homes. These girls might be sold into prostitution or enter cotton mills to work under the control of intermediaries, with all their wage income being received by the intermediaries for a certain period. As for male children, there were also instances of parents transferring them to factories to learn a trade. These apprentices worked long hours, with the employers providing room and board, but mostly without wages. The food provided by the employers was extremely poor, causing these children to suffer from illnesses due to malnutrition. From this, it can be seen that thousands of children in this port city were separated from their biological families. Although their circumstances differed, their lives were all in the hands of others, and they were often subjected to mistreatment, a truly miserable situation. In view of the complex nature of this issue, the Director of the Industry Department of this Bureau suggested to the Bureau to use all possible means to ensure that cases of child trafficking were reported to the relevant personnel of the Bureau and to establish a "Child Protection Section," with the Director of the Industry Department concurrently serving as the Director of the Section. The Director also requested the Bureau to cooperate closely with Chinese and foreign organizations dedicated to child protection. All of the above suggestions were accepted.</p>

<p>自戰事發生以來、本埠有大批孤兒或已入他人掌握之中希受其利用、或有陷于此等地位之虞、最近兩年間、就捕房解送兒童保障科處理之案件而言、因父母死于戰事而被隣人鬻賣之兒童、爲數不少、此外幼年男女、受丐頭之指揮、行乞街頭、亦屬屢見不鮮、本局對於此輩兒童、誠欲一一設法予以保護、然人數旣如此衆多、能力恐有未逮、</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, a large number of orphans in this port city have either fallen into the hands of others with the hope of exploiting them, or are in danger of falling into such a situation. In the past two years, judging from the cases handled by the police station's Child Protection Section, a significant number of children were sold by neighbors due to the death of their parents in the war. Furthermore, it is not uncommon for young boys and girls to beg on the streets under the command of beggar gang leaders. This Bureau sincerely wishes to find ways to protect each and every one of these children, but with such a large number of people, our capabilities may fall short.</p>
<p>地方敎會協助工作</p>
<p>Local Churches Assisting in the Work</p>
<p>本局承認兒童保障科所担任之工作、如欲使社會信任、非先使民衆了解不可、「上海地方敎會」鑒於兒童保障科所任工作之重要、曾聘用社會工作專員一人、襄理該科工作、該會之熱誠、至爲局方所感荷、</p>
<p>This Bureau recognizes that if the work undertaken by the Child Protection Section is to gain social trust, it is essential to first make it understood by the public. Recognizing the importance of the work undertaken by the Child Protection Section, the "Local Churches of Shanghai" have hired a social work specialist to assist the section in its work. The Bureau is extremely grateful for the enthusiasm of the churches.</p>
<p>遭難兒童可分四類</p>
<p>Children in Distress Can Be Divided into Four Categories</p>
<p>查受人剝削之兒童、可分爲下列四類、（一）在家庭環境下者、有婢女·養女•童養媳·及女傭等等、（二）經捕房注意之乞丐·及走失迷路·或無家可歸·或受人遺棄·或被拐離家之兒童等、（三）嚮導員舞女及娼妓等、（四）工廠中僱用之兒童、有在包工制度下之女工及無工資之學徒等、</p>
<p>Upon investigation, children who are exploited can be divided into the following four categories: (1) those in domestic settings, including female servants, adopted daughters, child brides, and female domestic helpers; (2) beggars who come to the attention of the police, children who are lost, homeless, abandoned, or abducted from home; (3) guides, dancing girls, and prostitutes; (4) children employed in factories, including female workers under the contract labor system and unpaid apprentices.</p>
<p>保障工作預定計畫</p>
<p>Planned Child Protection Work</p>
<p>上年初、兒童保陣科主任曾向局方陳稱、上述四類兒童、除第一類外、均可設法尋覓、惟在家庭環境之下者、因情形複維、尋覓不易、保護較難、是以該科先從其他三類着手、俾有成績可觀、並使民衆知悉該科之工作情形、至於婢女問題之處理、尚須從緩、</p>
<p>At the beginning of last year, the Director of the Child Protection Section stated to the Bureau that, apart from the first category, the other three categories of children mentioned above could be located through various means. However, those in domestic settings are difficult to locate and protect due to the complex nature of their circumstances. Therefore, the section would first focus on the other three categories in order to achieve noticeable results and make the public aware of the section's work. As for the handling of the issue of female servants, it would have to be dealt with at a later stage.</p>
<p>案件處理力求適當</p>
<p>Strive for Appropriate Case Handling</p>
<p>上年間、凡經捕房發現之兒童、屬於第二類者、均經該科安置、在該科未成立以前、此等案件、概山捕房送交法院分別發落、據法院之通常辦法、係將若輩分置於某某兩機關、此後若輩之幸福、爲當道所不問、自上年一月份起、該科與本局總裁·曁警務處長商定、嗣後此類事件、當改用社會之手續處理、所有此輩兒童、除須出庭作證者外、不再解送法院、倘有解送之必要、則該科應派代表到庭、陳述其關於處分方法之意見、現在各捕房均照該科所定辦法將男女分送兩臨時收容所、由該科職員每晨前往各該收容所調查案情、並設法安揷、凡來滬覓業而誤入迷途之靑年婦女、一經發現、即山該科辦理、一面竭力助其覓業、一面查訪其親屬、以便通知、經各機關收養之兒童、先受身體檢查、如有必要、即送醫院診視、已達法定結婚年齡之婢女、因不能如願出嫁而脫逃者、由該機關協助成婚其所持理山、爲主婦對於婢女之婚姻、無權干涉、綜觀上年各項工作成績良佳、所經受理案件之性質及其處理之方法、見本報告附錄、</p>
<p>During the past year, all children found by the police station belonging to the second category were placed by the section. Before the establishment of the section, these cases were generally sent by the police station to the court for separate disposition. According to the court's usual practice, these children would be placed in one of two institutions, and their subsequent well-being would be disregarded by the authorities. Since January of last year, the section, in consultation with the Director-General of this Bureau and the Chief of Police, agreed that such cases should be handled using social procedures from then on. All such children would no longer be sent to court, except for those who needed to testify. If it was necessary to send them, the section would send a representative to court to state its opinion on the method of disposition. Currently, all police stations are following the procedures set by the section, sending boys and girls separately to two temporary shelters, where the section's staff visit each shelter every morning to investigate the circumstances of the cases and find ways to place them. Any young women who come to Shanghai to seek employment and accidentally get lost are handled by the section, which makes every effort to help them find employment and locate their relatives in order to notify them. Children adopted by various institutions are first given a physical examination, and if necessary, sent to the hospital for examination. Female servants who have reached the legal marriage age but are unable to marry as desired and escape are assisted by the institution in getting married, on the grounds that the mistress has no right to interfere in the marriage of the female servant. Overall, the results of the past year's work have been excellent. The nature of the cases accepted and the methods of handling them can be found in the appendix to this report.</p>
<p>捕捉丐童免爲匪徒</p>
<p>Catch Beggar Children to Prevent Them from Becoming Bandits</p>
<p>自戰事爆發以後、本埠「兒童保育會」曾設法收容販報男女兒重、予以保護及讀書之機會、並收留大批丐童、兒童保障科有鑒於此、爰於上年八月間商請兩捕房捕捉流浪街頭之丐童、送交該科核辦、迄年終爲止、丐童案件經該科處理者共一二六起、此項工作、雖進行不甚迅速、但希望　後有大批丐童得送交該科處理、就已調查之案件而言、其中能代覓得親友者爲數不少、此類丐童、倘不給以較優之生活、則將來造成歹徒、常可斷言、</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, the "Children's Welfare Association" in this port city has been trying to accommodate and protect boys and girls who sell newspapers, providing them with opportunities for education, and has also taken in a large number of beggar children. In view of this, in August of last year, the Child Protection Section consulted with the two police stations to capture beggar children wandering on the streets and send them to the section for verification. By the end of the year, the section had handled a total of 126 cases of beggar children. Although this work has not progressed very quickly, it is hoped that a large number of beggar children can be sent to the section for processing in the future. As far as the cases that have been investigated are concerned, a considerable number of them have been able to find relatives and friends. It can be confidently asserted that if these beggar children are not given a better life, they will become criminals in the future.</p>
<p>救濟機關均予津貼</p>
<p>Subsidies are Given to Relief Organizations</p>
<p>戰後難童收容所及救濟機關、先後成立、此外尚有專爲難童設立之醫院•肺病療養院、亦已開辦、本局對於下列各機關因其收養兒童保障科所轉送兒童、曾於上年間分別給予津貼、計（一）濟良所與難童收容所五千元、（二）婦孺救濟會一萬五千元、（三）全國中華慈幼協會五千元、此外有仁濟醫院•紅十字會醫院•同仁醫院•及普慈療養院等四家、因與該科合作、亦由木局發給補助金、婦孺救濟會又曾領受自緊急救濟費項下撥給之補助金五千元、該會與全國中華慈幼協會、各經上海難民救濟協會按照收容人數、給予津貼、本局對於難民救濟協會曾於上年前九個月間、補助國幣十萬元、</p>
<p>After the war, refugee children's shelters and relief organizations were established one after another. In addition, hospitals and sanatoriums specializing in refugee children have also been opened. This Bureau has given subsidies to the following organizations in the past year for adopting children transferred by the Child Protection Section: (1) the Jiliang Institute and the Refugee Children's Shelter, 5,000 yuan; (2) the Women and Children Relief Association, 15,000 yuan; (3) the National China Child Welfare Association, 5,000 yuan. In addition, the Renji Hospital, the Red Cross Hospital, the Tongren Hospital, and the Puci Sanatorium, etc., have also been given subsidies by the Bureau for cooperating with the section. The Women and Children Relief Association also received a subsidy of 5,000 yuan from the emergency relief fund. The association and the National China Child Welfare Association were each given subsidies by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association according to the number of people they accommodated. This Bureau subsidized the Refugee Relief Association with 100,000 yuan in national currency for the first nine months of last year.</p>
<h3>本埠氣温仍高　上海初見瑞雪　高氣壓仍向東西省進行中漢寗亦飛雪平津氣候溫和</h3>
<h3>Local Temperature Remains High; Auspicious Snow Seen for the First Time in Shanghai; High Pressure Still Moving Towards the Eastern and Western Provinces; Hanning Also Has Snow; Climate in the Beijing-Tianjin Area is Mild</h3>
<p>上海已於昨晨開始飛雪、唯氣候並未酷寒、除上海外、漢口·南京·亦飄揚雪花中、茲分述各情如次、</p>
<p>Shanghai started to have snow yesterday morning, but the climate was not severely cold. In addition to Shanghai, Hankou and Nanjing also had snow. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>首次見雪</p>
<p>First Snowfall</p>
<p>據大通社記者探悉、昨晨本埠雖開始見雪、惟當早晨五六時間之最低溫度、尚在攝氏零上一度八、華氏爲三十五度一、遠較去年冬至前後、受西伯利亞寒流、兩度襲擊時之氣候爲溫和、</p>
<p>According to reports from the Datong News Agency, although the city began to see snow yesterday morning, the lowest temperature at 5 or 6 in the morning was still 1.8 degrees Celsius above zero, or 35.1 degrees Fahrenheit, which is much milder than the climate during the two Siberian cold waves that hit around the winter solstice last year.</p>
<p>寒流所在</p>
<p>Location of the Cold Wave</p>
<p>查西伯利亞高氣壓、仍向東南東進行、故東西省已受寒流影響、查中蘇交界之滿洲里、昨晨氣溫尚在攝氏零下三十一度、吉林溫度亦落至攝氏零下二十八度、</p>
<p>It is noted that the Siberian high pressure is still moving towards the east-southeast, so the eastern and western provinces have been affected by the cold wave. The temperature in Manzhouli, on the Sino-Soviet border, was still minus 31 degrees Celsius yesterday morning, and the temperature in Jilin also dropped to minus 28 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>平津晴和</p>
<p>Beijing-Tianjin Area Sunny and Mild</p>
<p>寒流如循東南東方向推進、中國北部及長江流域曁上海各地、均可免爲所襲、縱使間接感受影響、惟亦極微細、按昨晨平津天氣、反較上海爲晴暖、</p>
<p>If the cold wave continues to move in the east-southeast direction, northern China, the Yangtze River Basin, and Shanghai will all be spared from its impact. Even if indirectly affected, it would be minimal. According to yesterday morning's weather in Beijing and Tianjin, it was sunny and warmer than Shanghai.</p>
<p>降雪時間</p>
<p>Snowfall Time</p>
<p>本埠昨晨之雪、其始降時間在一時左右、當上午八時許、比較濃密、卒因地面氣候之溫和、未及墮地、即行溶化、故馬路始終未爲雪水所濕潤、午後雪降轉密、馬路爲雪水浸潤、</p>
<p>The snow in this city yesterday morning began to fall around 1 o'clock. Around 8 o'clock in the morning, it was relatively dense. However, due to the mild ground climate, it melted before it could fall to the ground, so the roads were never wet with snow. In the afternoon, the snowfall became denser, and the roads were wet with snow.</p>
<p>氣候尙穩又據天文台消息、昨晨長江流域、如漢口·南京·兩地亦飛揚雪花惟因平津氣候之良好、照此推斷、則上海天氣不致趨於惡劣、且無大雪、</p>
<p>The climate is still stable. According to the astronomical observatory, Hankou and Nanjing in the Yangtze River Basin also had snow yesterday morning. However, due to the good weather in Beijing and Tianjin, it can be inferred that the weather in Shanghai will not deteriorate and there will be no heavy snow.</p>

<p>Since the prices of daily necessities such as rice, grain, and soybean oil have risen sharply in Shanghai, first, two rice shops, Dahua and Yongkang, were found to have lined their measuring containers with cardboard and hollowed out the weights to exploit the common people. After being reported, the French Concession police investigated the shop owners according to law, and the court imposed fines. These details have been reported in previous newspapers. Now, the French Concession police received a secret report and sent detectives to investigate the Hengkangsheng Fermented Grains Shop on Labor Father Road and Market Road, finding that they were using lead sheets to line the ladles used to sell oil, seizing one large and one small ladle. In addition, the Wanheshun Fermented Grains Shop at No. 65 Ximen Road was found to have inserted a thick piece of cardboard into the large ladle to exploit customers. The shop owner's wife, Shen Mi (46 years old, from Ningbo), and the manager of Wanheshun, Cao Xinqi (34 years old, from Pudong), were taken into custody and released on bail. Yesterday afternoon, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer explained the case and prosecuted them for violating the regulations on weights and measures. After questioning by Judge Huang Yan, the court sentenced Shen Mi to a fine of 180 yuan and Cao Xinqi to a fine of 200 yuan. If they were to perform labor in lieu of the fine, each day would be calculated at two yuan. The three ladles were confiscated.</p>

One hand grenade was placed outside the bags. This was discovered by a patrolling officer. Upon opening the bags, six more hand grenades were found. The officer immediately reported to the Xinzha Police Station, which dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to take away the contraband. After questioning residents in the vicinity, they were taken to the police station's warehouse for filing. At the same time, the police are investigating the person who discarded the contraband.</p>

<h3>新政酒排間　經理昨被謀殺　身上發現現刀傷多處　起意似屬搶刦錢財</h3>
<h3>Manager of New Government Tavern Murdered Yesterday; Multiple Knife Wounds Found on Body; Motive Appears to Be Robbery</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、公館馬路朱葆三路廿六號「新政」酒吧間今（二—）晨發生謀財害命案、詳情如次、希臘人柯索　蒂　年六旬有四、僑華幾已四十年、任該酒吧間經理、平時單身信宿酒吧間樓上、昨晨五時三十分、西崽照常前往該酒吧間、叩門後無　者、</p>
<p>According to the English-language "Evening Star," a murder for money case occurred at the "New Government" bar at No. 26 Gongguan Road and Zhubaosan Road this morning (21st). The details are as follows: Greek national 柯索　蒂, 64 years old, has been living in China for almost 40 years and is the manager of the bar. He usually stayed alone upstairs in the bar. At 5:30 AM yesterday, the waiter went to the bar as usual, but there was no response after knocking on the door.</p>
<p>知有變故　立即通知該酒吧間主希爾登、希氏於六時午自寓所趕到、啟　入內即見柯氏屍首、　臥橫　血泊中、乃報告法捕房、捕採到塲、發現收款機上有手印甚多、血機中之四五百元、則已被兇手刦去、保險箱與「吃角土老虎」機、亦有手印、但其中銀錢並無損失、</p>
<p>Realizing something was wrong, he immediately notified the owner of the bar, Mr. Hilton, who arrived from his residence at 6 AM. Upon opening the door and entering, he saw Mr. 柯索's body lying in a pool of blood. He reported it to the French Concession police. The police arrived at the scene and found many fingerprints on the cash register. 400-500 yuan from the cash register had been taken by the murderer. There were also fingerprints on the safe and the "slot machine," but no money was lost.</p>
<p>柯氏屍首　頸部半被斫斷、身上亦有刀斫傷痕、屍旁遺有血跡斑斑之菜刀一柄、捕探乃將屍首位置與手印、攝影備案、取去屍者希臘籍護照、並將屍首移入法租界台拉斯脫路騐屍所、由希臘領事楊　拉托斯於星期日騐屍、柯氏屍體、</p>
<p>Mr. 柯索's body had its neck half severed, and there were also knife wounds on his body. A kitchen knife stained with blood was found next to the body. The police photographed the position of the body and the fingerprints for the record, took the deceased's Greek passport, and moved the body to the morgue on Tailastuo Road in the French Concession. The Greek Consul 楊　拉托斯 will examine the body on Sunday. Mr. 柯索's body</p>
<p>係穿浴衣　當係午夜業後、啟門血被謀殺者、櫃台後有一小箱、內貯水兵寄存之美金七百元與法幣一千元、並未被刦、可見兇手並非熟悉酒吧間情形者、法警務處對於此案、正廣續偵查中、</p>
<p>was wearing a bathrobe. He was likely murdered after midnight after opening the door. There was a small box behind the counter containing 700 US dollars and 1,000 Chinese yuan deposited by sailors, which was not robbed. This shows that the murderer was not familiar with the bar's situation. The French police are continuing their investigation into the case.</p>

<p>Father An, a French national and director of the vocational school at the main church in Tushanwan, Xujiahui, was suddenly murdered by bandits on August 30 of last year, strangled to death with a rope. The French Concession police dispatched detectives to pursue the criminals. On the evening of September 9, a criminal, a Catholic named Ju Boxu, surrendered himself to the police. Subsequently, based on Ju's confession, Chinese and Western detectives successively arrested four accomplices: Shen Xingtang, Xu Gendi, Wang Rong, and Jiang Yongqing. However, the main culprit, Zhou Yuelou, fled to the guerrilla zone in Pudong and could not be apprehended. Therefore, the police sent Ju and the other four suspects to the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court for interrogation and investigation. As a result, they were prosecuted for crimes such as robbery and murder. After preliminary questioning by Court President Liao Yan, it was deemed that the location where the crime occurred was under Chinese administration before the war, and it was necessary to apply to a higher court for designation of jurisdiction. An order was issued to detain and await a decision to be made at a later date. It is now heard that this case has been designated by the Shanghai Branch of the Supreme Court, after being transferred from the Third Branch of the Higher Court of the Second Special District, to be accepted and tried by the Second Special District Court. Yesterday morning, Court President Liao of the First Criminal Division ordered Ju Boxu and the other four suspects to be brought in for further questioning. The defendants' statements remained the same as in previous interrogations. The court ruled that further investigation was required into the case and that defense lawyers should be appointed. The hearing was postponed to February 5, and the defendants remained in custody.</p>

<h3>The Republic of China, Year 28: A Review of Chinese Education (4)</h3>
<p>— Chen Lijiang</p>
<p>(4) Social Education</p>
<p>Over the past year, there has been considerable progress in social education. A summary of the developments is as follows: (1) "Promotion of Remedial Education for Illiterate Adults": Remedial education for illiterate adults continues to be implemented in various provinces and cities across the country according to the previously established six-year plan. At the same time, wartime remedial education for the populace is being promoted in twelve provinces and cities. Guangxi Province has even designated this year as the Year of Adult Education, with full efforts to promote it.

<h3>Scorton Cup Snow Battle Yesterday, Lido Obtained a Spot in the Re-examination, Eliminating the Survey Team 5-1.  East China Will Face Portugal This Morning</h3>
<p>Yesterday, amid heavy snowfall, the second week of the Scorton Cup football match, Lido against the Survey Team, started at 3:00 PM in the snow at Jiaozhou Park. There were few spectators, greatly reducing the interest. As Lido was the champion of the previous tournament, and also with the might of nine consecutive wins in the A group, it was confident of victory in dealing with the Survey Team, which belonged to the B group. Survey team general Setele was absent due to injury, and Chen's line was even more weakened. Therefore, after contact, Lido controlled the overall situation. However, due to the wet ground and slippery ball, it could not exert its full strength. In the first half, Lido won by two goals. In the second half, after each side scored one goal, the Survey Team lost two more cities in a row. As a result, 5-1, Lido defeated the Survey Team and, like Xifosi, which eliminated St. Francis with 6-2, obtained the right to re-examination.

<p>The snow battle started with the whistle of referee Shen Huichun. The Survey Team attacked first, but Lido's athletes did not allow it to penetrate deeply, immediately blocking the way, and launching a counterattack. After twelve minutes, Xu Wenkui broke through alone, straight into the enemy's hinterland, passing to Sun Jinshun. Sun did not hesitate at all, and with a quick leg, the ball flew into the net, opening the record. At 30 minutes, Xu Wenkui made a strange shot from 30 yards away, and the ball was steep and rapid, and the Survey Team fell into another city. At the end of the first half, Lido won by two goals. As the battle resumed, Lido was familiar with the road, Cao Qiuting passed from the edge, Xu Wenkui rushed to the door, gently dialed, the enemy's door broke again, and three passes were made in a row. The Survey Team borrowed one city to get a corner kick opportunity. San Maigengs was the main opener, Lu Zhongen pushed out with both hands, the ball was held by Huiya, passed to Fei Misi Tuo, Fei lifted his foot and hit hard, saving a goal, becoming three to one. Lido continued to attack, and the Survey Team's gate area was in danger. Before long, Cao Qiuting sent a corner kick just right, Jinshun Kehou and others jumped up at the same time, but none of them were hit, and the ball fell beside Qixiang, Wu's side shot angrily, and both hit the target. Finally, Qixiang was assisted by Wenkui and made another contribution. As a result, Lido eliminated the Survey Team 5-1</p>

<h3>In the Panic of Grain, Flour and Wheat, American Flour and Wheat Will Be Shipped to China in Large Quantities. The US Government Will Subsidize the Sale of Flour and Wheat to China and the Philippines. Flour Mills Are Thinking of Speculation, Which Is Like a Bolt From the Blue</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation was still serious. Although the No. 2 flour mill maintained the original price of ten yuan, the restrictions were still strict. Even to the customers, it was still not approved for sale. Although the flour mills have abundant flour stocks, they are unwilling to sell easily to wait for a good price, which has caused the price of recycled flour to reach a new high. According to the current situation in Yantai, Qingdao, and Qinhuangdao, the actual sales are not strong, but because of the relationship of flour for goods, and the deposit of a guarantee deposit in advance, even if the loss of transporting flour is huge, they have to drink poison to quench their thirst. This kind of environment is only seen in the history of the business world. Therefore, once the factory is closed, the high price of the stock orders is repeated endlessly. The transaction volume in the market was about 10,000 bags, excluding the factory's sales balance, and the transaction volume of car and ship recycled goods was less than 10,000 bags. The selling price of Pao Che brand has risen to 11.60 to 6.50 yuan, and the selling price of Bing Chuan brand has risen to 11.45 to 50 yuan. The floating stock of foreign flour has dried up, and the price has been repeatedly speculative. Those who have direct distribution have no formal market. Yesterday, 3,000 bags of flour were shipped to Hong Kong, and 500 bags were shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<p>The wheat market is still in a stalemate. The hoarding of goods by the cargo owners is becoming more and more serious, and the purchase of wheat by Japanese flour mills is still continuous, which has caused the market to be secretly hyped again and again. Since the public market price yesterday reached 18.56 yuan, the secret price has reached a new high of 19 yuan. It is found that the current wheat stock in Shanghai is less than 100,000 bags. Although there is wheat stock in the inland, it is all occupied by a certain party, and the source has been disappointed. Fortunately, a telegram came that the US Department of Agriculture will allow subsidies for wheat exports from Pacific ports to Hong Kong and China, and flour exports are also outside the subsidies, in order to eliminate the US surplus wheat of 15 million bushels. With this large amount of flour and wheat supply, and the subsidies from the US government, it can alleviate the hidden worries of China's flour and wheat panic, and can dispel the ambition of flour merchants to manipulate the market. Although far water is difficult to save near fire, if China's flour and wheat are higher, American flour and wheat will be able to give a serious blow. Moreover, China is still repaying the previous cotton and wheat loans on schedule to fulfill its credit.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Remain Firm, Japanese Buy White Rice in Wuxi</h3>
<p>The rice market is still weak due to the weak source of rice from the interior. Yesterday, there were only more than 500 bags of Qingjiao rice transferred from Hongkou. In addition, due to the continued rise in the prices of foreign rice producing areas, tight money, and other issues, the market continued to show a good face. In the morning, there were general inland helpers to buy. Then, the local shops were also interested. For the new arrivals of goods, the capital is heavy. Once someone inquires, the shouts are high. Except for the Chang Kun high-quality goods, which have not been sampled, the medium-quality Su Tong rice is also scarce in the market, with few transactions, and the market has increased by half a yuan. Tongli rice is priced at 40 yuan, and other Qingjiao special thin rice is priced at 39.20 to 39 yuan, which is 1/2 yuan to 6/7 jiao higher than the previous day. According to statistics, the total transaction volume of various goods in the city is about 14,500 bags.</p>
<p>High-end foreign rice is still difficult to transfer, while broken rice continues to become 500 tons, with a price of 33.30 yuan. Fuka also released 100 tons of Tokyo Indica rice, with a price of 32 yuan. Now that the new orders from Saigon are few, the shops and customers are also eating, and the stores are also absorbing. The price is 3/4 jiao higher. The broken rice is also followed by 2/3 jiao, but in addition to the orders that have not arrived, there are still 70,000 bags in stock in the city. There are also 150,000 bags of Saigon No. 1 and 2 rice and Vietnam rice. About 40/500,000 bags of high and sub-grades of foreign rice have arrived or are about to arrive, and broken rice is still being ordered continuously. Therefore, if there is no manipulation outside the orbit of the rice market, it may not be too expensive.</p>
<p>Since the opening of the city gates on the 18th in the Wuxi rice market, and the restoration of water and land transportation, the rice market situation, door sales firms, and companies have replenished japonica rice. The market price has soared. Japanese merchants have also been continuously ordering a large amount of white rice from the firms and factories to transport to Japan for relief, which has broken the price limit of 20.50 yuan per stone for the rice and rice market. 160 catties per city must be 22 yuan, and the source of rice boats is scarce. Some companies that have not made throw goods have to replenish. High-quality white rice is 21.30 yuan per stone, white Duzi Yangjian is 21.30 yuan, brown rice is about 20 yuan, and japonica rice is 10.20 yuan. However, because the distilleries' needs are met, Bai Yuan feels tired of going to waste, and is 22 yuan per stone. Now there are more than 500,000 shi of rice in stock, which can only be sold until the spring. However, the grain in the hands of farmers is quite large in number (Know).</p>
<h3>Finance Idle Foreign Exchange Market; US to Grant New Loans to China; Stabilizing Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC quotations remained unchanged. The unofficial British and American exchange market was quiet due to the Saturday half-day trading. Amidst the quiet, a slight easing was observed, but the results were indistinguishable from the closing price of the day before yesterday. The morning opening was even. Because silk and tea merchants were selling slightly and Chinese banks were also filling orders, and speculative traders were slightly closing out positions, the market briefly hardened. At that time, foreign banks were absorbing US$4.875 and $8.03125 at the lowest prices. Subsequently, sellers disappeared, so the market returned to even. By noon closing, it remained at US$4.84375 and $8, similar to the previous day. The futures market showed no difference from the spot market.</p>
<p>It is said in the market that large amounts of imported cotton and wheat will be settled around the New Year in the Gregorian calendar. It is generally expected that foreign exchange will tighten, but the British and American exchange rates still fluctuate around five pence and eight yuan. Not only has there been no tightening, but there is a possibility of further easing. This is likely influenced by the new US loan to China. According to financial sources, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Hu Shih, recently signed a US$10 million credit loan with the US government. It is said that part of the new loan will be used to offset previous purchases of American wheat, and the remainder will be used to purchase automobiles. It is also reported that the US government is still negotiating the planned US$100 million credit loan to China and has not changed its original intention due to the European war. Therefore, the shift from stable to loose foreign exchange is inevitable.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea Merchants Selling Slightly</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, London's long-term and near-term contracts both fell 1/15. The New York silver price remained stable. The London gold price was fixed. The exchange rates of British to US, Shanghai, and France were all stable. US to British narrowed 0.025, to Shanghai unchanged, to France narrowed a small 0.025. The central bank's quoted exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling prices were British gold US$4.84375 and US exchange $8, with no change compared to the previous close. After opening, the market was quiet. The HSBC quotation was unchanged. The silver equalization tax fell 0.0125. Thereafter, silk and tea exporters sold slightly, and Chinese banks also sold, so the situation hardened slightly. Exporters sold US$8.03125 to foreign banks, and Chinese banks sold British gold US$4.859375 to Chase National Bank for this month. At that time, the spot price also eased to US$4.875. Soon, speculative traders also sold this month's US$8 to foreign banks. Later, sellers decreased, so the market returned to even. At noon, foreign banks traded British gold US$4.859375 among themselves. Until the noon closing, the bank's spot selling prices were British gold US$4.84375 and US exchange $8. Next month's futures were British gold US$4.78125 and US exchange $7.875. As a result, there was no change compared to the spot and futures of the previous day. There was no market on Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>Hong Kong British and American Unchanged</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 20th - This morning's foreign exchange market opened evenly. The British and American exchange rates were generally unchanged. The Shanghai exchange spot price fell slightly by one yuan, to $305. The Japanese exchange spot price tightened 0.025, to $104. It was stable at 10:30 am, with no change.

The US exchange spot price also recovered 0.125, to $7.5625. The Shanghai exchange rate fell by half a yuan, to $104.75. A joint note was slightly cheaper at $101.50.</p>
<h3>Gold Market as Sluggish as Before Only Five Yuan Fluctuation</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold dark market situation was quite sluggish due to the weekend effect. There was only a five-yuan fluctuation during the day, but the situation was still soft. As a result, it fell another four yuan. During the half-day, it initially opened down five yuan, at $4,040, because securities firms were slightly filling orders. Later, a money exchange and a securities firm mutually searched, and it was seen to recover twice. However, because money exchanges and cash houses were full of selling intentions, the noon closing was still only $4,041. There was no market in the afternoon, and there were few changes off the market. By half-day, there were few transactions, only a few hundred taels. Jewelry gold was fixed. Customs gold and others remained stable.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Down Another Four Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) had a stable and weak opening. Initially, the securities firms sold 20 taels to the jewelry firms for $4,040, down five yuan from the previous close. Soon, a money exchange came to scoop up slightly, and a securities firm also bought, and they rose five yuan together. A money exchange bought 20 taels from a peer for $4,045. Subsequently, another money exchange and cash house mutually sold, and it fell another four yuan. The cash house sold 30 taels to the jewelry firm for $4,041. Then, because a securities firm came to search again, it was seen to rise again. The securities firm bought 10 taels from the money exchange for $4,045.

<h3>Statistics Price Changes</h3>
<p>October-November of the 28th Year (2)</p>
<p>There were 18 price increases in October, 48 fewer than in September. The reason is that foreign exchange gradually eased during this month, resulting in a decline in commodity prices. Therefore, the prices of goods that have increased in price cannot continue to rise regardless of the facts, unless there is another reason. Therefore, the number of price increases is three times lower than the number in September. The 18 categories of goods that have increased in price can be divided into seven categories: medicine, food and beverage, printing and publishing, civil engineering and fuel, daily necessities, and cultural supplies. Food and beverage accounted for the first place with five cases; medicine and printing and publishing accounted for the second place with four cases each; daily necessities accounted for the third place with three cases; and civil engineering, fuel, and cultural supplies accounted for the last place with one case each.

<p>Children's Weekly</p>
<h3>How to Develop the Habit of Self-Study</h3>
<p>— Wan Wen</p>
<p>It is difficult for children who cannot control themselves to study on their own. Taking the self-study class in school as an example, if there is no teacher monitoring, they will talk loudly and make a mess, disturbing the students who are studying and unable to read. Only when the teacher appears at the door will the sound suddenly quiet down. This bad habit not only wastes precious time but also hinders our future. May I ask if there will always be others to supervise and monitor us in our lives? If we do not have the habit of self-study, we will not know new knowledge and new culture. Only some dead knowledge from the past will be used to deal with the rapidly advancing era, and we will be eliminated as an outdated person. Therefore, starting from today, which is also the beginning of the vacation, it is a good opportunity for us to develop the habit of self-study. Let us make full use of it!</p>
<p>If we study the history of great inventors, great scholars, and great men, we can know that most of them were from poor families and could not afford to go to school. Their knowledge was entirely due to their tireless self-study. Therefore, in addition to enjoying their contributions, we must also imitate their attitude and spirit of self-study. The holiday has begun. According to our needs, we will automatically list the self-study curriculum, choose our favorite books and newspapers according to our interests, make up for the failed subjects, and review the old textbooks to make our knowledge more thorough and our vision wider. However, to form a habit, I think there are several points to pay attention to.</p>
<p>(1) Continue to do it: The most common problem that children have is that they are very happy to do it for the first few days, but after a few days, they become bored and lazy. Not only will they achieve nothing in the future, but all their previous efforts will be wasted.</p>
<p>(2) Do it with all your heart and soul: No matter what you do, you must concentrate to succeed. If you play for a while and talk for a while during (self-study), even if you spend a lot of time, you will not get any benefits.</p>
<p>(3) Do not do it hard: Difficulties are inevitable during self-study. As long as you are not ashamed to ask, ask our parents, sisters, brothers, and classmates. Whoever can solve my difficulties is our teacher. The only teacher who does not speak is the dictionary. We must always be close to it and make it our only friend.</p>
<p>Children, hurry up and do it, and do it practically!</p>
<h3>Heard Fifty Li</h3>
<p>— Fei Han</p>
<p>Children! Often when you are talking in the school playground, standing very far apart from each other, you must shout loudly, otherwise you will not be able to hear clearly or even hear at all. If you are farther apart, a mile, several miles, dozens of miles or dozens of miles, then you have to use mail, telephone or telegram to send messages. You think, this is certainly certain.</p>
<p>But in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, where the air is cold and dry, the power of this air to transmit sound waves is extremely high, fast and far. So in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, the sound of ordinary conversations can immediately be transmitted to very fast, very far and invisible places. Some sound waves can travel up to ten miles away; some fifteen miles; and some even up to seventeen miles away, which is more than fifty-four Chinese miles (1 mile = 3.219 Chinese miles). Even the sound of walking on the ground can be heard by people three miles away. If there is a loud bugle sound, it will be heard hundreds of miles away. Therefore, people in the Arctic and Antarctic regions can use very ordinary sounds to talk to each other within fifty miles, without the need for communication devices such as telephones, telegrams, and mail.</p>
<p>Children! Do you find it strange? This is all because the air in the Arctic and Antarctic regions is different from the air in our area!</p>
<h3>New Fables</h3>
<p>— Gongchao</p>
<p>In a mountain area of Sichuan, there are many monkeys. How do people capture these monkeys?</p>
<p>A person rocks a boat, mooring it at the foot of the mountain. The boat is covered with things monkeys love to eat, like peaches. The person hides in the boat’s cabin. Before long, the boat deck is hopping with monkeys, big and small, eagerly grabbing the food. Then, the person hiding in the cabin stealthily uses a pole to push the boat away from the shore, further and further out. By the time the monkeys realize what’s happening, the boat is already in the middle of the water.</p>
<p>Knowing they’ve been tricked, the monkeys all desperately try to attack the person. But the person remains calm, holding a knife in one hand and a chicken in the other, with a cage nearby specifically for trapping monkeys. He cuts off the chicken's head with the knife, and fresh blood gushes out. The monkeys, seeing this sight, are terrified and tremble, stopping their attack all at once.</p>
<p>The person then raises the headless chicken high, using the knife tip to threaten the trembling monkeys, forcing them obediently, one by one, into the cage.</p>
<p>Because the monkeys are afraid of blood, they become slaves to humans.</p>
<h3>Erroneous Mentality</h3>
<p>— Shushan</p>
<p>Playing mahjong is extremely popular in Shanghai. Whether rich or poor, families use it as a form of entertainment.</p>
<p>After finishing lunch, if there's no desire to go out and just sitting at home feels lonely, people invite Mrs. Zhang from next door, Sister Li... any idle person who has nothing to do after a meal, to make up a table of "mahjong". All the preparations before playing are meticulously arranged by the Ah Ma, and then the sounds of mahjong tiles begin to play. Round after round, people take turns, "playing" tirelessly. Time passes in the "crack, crack" of the mahjong tiles. In the blink of an eye, it's already past four o'clock, and Ah Mao has returned from school with his book bag. They've already played twelve rounds, but still don't want to stop. The losers want to win back their money, while the winners want to win even more. So the game continues, driven by the two parties' completely different desires. As soon as Ah Mao enters the house and hears the sound of the tiles, he quickly drops his book bag and walks to the room where they are playing mahjong. He finds playing mahjong very interesting.</p>
<p>His mother has some small errands to run, so she asks him to play a few rounds for her. He is extremely happy because the last time he played mahjong for his mother, he won a lot of money, and his mother bought him a lot of candy afterward. This time, hearing that he's been asked to play for his mother, he eagerly sits down, because he's been hoping his mother would ask him to play for a long time. While he can't be said to have a deep understanding of mahjong, he is at least very familiar with it. Plus, his luck with the tiles is quite good, and he "wins" several hands in a row, repeatedly being the "dealer". When his mother approaches, he "wins" another hand, a "spicy" three hundred points, and is very excited. Mrs. Zhang even praises him, saying, "Your Ah Mao is truly an experienced mahjong player. After you left, he 'won' several hands." A smile appears on his mother's face, and he is, of course, very proud of himself. He continues "playing" until it's time for dinner, at which point the game stops. This time, he has again won money for his mother. After dinner, he plays for a while, then goes to bed, completely forgetting about his schoolwork.</p>
<p>Children! What do you think of the facts listed above? I think there must be children like this among you. I truly worry about children like Ah Mao because they think playing mahjong is a normal thing. But you should know that even normal things can have extraordinary effects. Ah Mao can be said to be poisoned by mahjong without even knowing it, thinking that winning money for his mother and receiving praise from others is an honor. I can say even more definitively: all children who like to play mahjong definitely don't study hard. Playing mahjong can also cultivate a gambling habit, especially in your childhood. If you develop a gambling habit, it can hinder your career for life! Therefore, I sincerely hope that children who like to play mahjong quickly get rid of this bad habit!</p>
<h3>Black Brothers (2)</h3>
<p>— Yimu</p>
<p>Grelle stayed at home, only doing odd jobs, such as when smoking meat in the mansion, he would hold the iron rack and turn it over and over on the fire, but eating smoked meat was also a rare thing, because his two brothers were naturally stingy, treated people very meanly, and were also very calculating with themselves. Most of Grelle's time was always busy polishing shoes, scrubbing floors, and sometimes scrubbing dishes, so what he did was equivalent to the work of a servant.</p>
<p>The situation in this valley and the surrounding area never changed much. Unexpectedly, there came a very rainy summer, and everything in the surrounding villages was ruined. The fodder had not yet been brought in, and was piled high on the threshing floor, when suddenly a flood came and completely washed away the haystacks, which drifted away to the sea. Then came hail, which ruined all the grapes. Not only that, but all the grains were ravaged by a kind of black pest. But strangely enough, only this Hundred Treasures Valley remained peaceful as usual. It rained here, but nowhere else. There was sunshine here, but nowhere else. Because the people in the surrounding villages had no harvest, they all came to the Black Brothers' manor to buy grain. But none of them went without hating them and cursing them, because the two brothers intentionally raised the price, asking for as much as they wanted, not worrying about whether people would buy it or not. The poor people, having no money to buy it, had to beg them for charity, but they refused everything. Even if someone starved to death in front of their door, they would not pay attention.</p>
<p>As winter approached, the weather was very cold. One day, the Black Brothers went out on business. As usual, they warned their younger brother, Little Grelle, not to let anyone into their house and not to take anything out. At that time, Little Grelle was sitting by the fire, busy smoking mutton. It was raining heavily outside, and the walls of the kitchen were damp. He turned the iron rack over and over, and the mutton on it was smoking nicely, turning brown. He thought to himself, "What a pity! Why don't my two brothers invite people to have a meal? They can eat such a big piece of fine mutton, while others don't even have a piece of dry bread to eat. If they came here to eat together, it would be good for their hearts."</p>
<p>As he was thinking this, he suddenly heard two knocks on the door. The sound was very heavy, as if the door knocker was wrapped in cloth. Grelle said to himself, "This must be a gust of wind blowing on the door. No one would dare to knock twice on our door." But listening carefully, it wasn't the wind. There really was someone knocking on the door. This time the knocking was heavier. Listening to the sound, the person was clearly very impatient. Little Grelle walked to the window, opened it, and stuck his head out to see who was knocking.</p>
<p>When he looked, it was a very short and strange-looking gentleman, whom he had never seen in his life. He had a very large nose, slightly bronze in color. His two cheeks were very round and red, as if they had been roasted by the fire for the past forty-eight hours. His two eyes sparkled beneath his fine eyelashes, full of joy. His mustache curled up on both sides of his mouth, round like two corkscrews. His hair was strangely a mixture of salt and pepper, and hung long over his shoulders on both sides. His body was four feet and six inches tall, and he wore a pointed hat, also three or four feet high, with a three-foot-long black feather inserted in it. He wore a tight-fitting coat, with the back protruding, like what is now called a swallowtail coat, and a black and shiny robe over it, which was blown by the wind, fully four times longer than his body.</p>
<p>Little Grelle was stunned when he saw this strange guest, and couldn't say a word. The old gentleman knocked heavily on the door twice more, and turned his head to look at the long robe being blown up by the wind. Just then, he caught sight of Little Grelle's blond head, sticking out of the window, his mouth and eyes wide open. The old gentleman changed his voice and said, "Hello! It's not very polite of you to answer the door like that. Let me in quickly, my clothes are soaked."</p>
<p>Indeed, the old gentleman was really wet from the rain. The black feather on his hat was so wet that it drooped down,夹在两腿之间，好像狗打急了，腿夹着尾巴垂头丧气的样子. The two corners of his mustache were also dripping water, spilling straight into his half-sleeve pocket, and then pouring out like waterwheels in a mill.</p>
<p>Little Grelle hurriedly said, "Sir, I beg your forgiveness, I really can't open the door, I'm very sorry." The old gentleman asked, "Why can't you?" Little Grelle said, "Sir, I can't let you in, really can't. If I do as you say, my two brothers will definitely beat me to death. Sir, what do you want?"</p>

<h3>The Peking Opera Theater in the Wartime Capital of Chongqing</h3>
<p>— Zhang Changqiu</p>
<p>Yesterday, a friend sent a letter from Chongqing, detailing the recent situation of Peking Opera in the new capital. Here is an excerpt below to inform our readers. There are several theaters in Chongqing, including theaters for Han Opera, Peking Opera, and movie theaters. The only Peking Opera theater is the Shandong Provincial Peking Opera Troupe, run by Mr. Shan Wang Bosheng. It was originally founded in Shandong by Han Fuju, and moved to Chongqing after the start of the war. It is subsidized by the Shandong government to perform anti-Japanese propaganda plays. All the actors are Bosheng's students. They are usually very diligent, wearing long robes made of blue cloth, with no sign of extravagance. The actors' lives are also very disciplined. In the morning, they take classes, learning about military and political knowledge related to the war of resistance. In the afternoon, they perform from 6:30 to 9:30, only three hours, but the ticket price is as high as one yuan or one yuan and fifty cents, and it is still full every day. The audience is mostly from the upper and middle classes, and there are military police in the audience to maintain order. The actors' stage names are very unfamiliar, and few people in Shanghai know them. The leading female role, Zhao Rongchen, imitates Yu Shuang's vocal style. Her makeup is dignified, her voice is mellow, and her expressions excel at conveying tragic beauty. She is truly a rare talent for female roles in the interior. Yan Fuhua, another leading actress, specializes in Qingyi and Huashan roles. Her voice is very strong, and her makeup is beautiful, but her pronunciation is not accurate enough, and her skills are slightly shallow. Zhao Zhixiang excels at both Qingyi and Xiaosheng roles. His makeup is elegant, his demeanor is refined, and his voice is strong and solid. Cui [blank character] is a Tan school Laosheng, with a slight醇味, but he trembles his voice too much, which is a shortcoming. Tie Zheng specializes in painted face roles, and also Hei Tou roles. He is tall and burly, and his makeup is reminiscent of Shao Shan. His voice is still considered loud. Lin Guiyin specializes in Qingyi and Huashan roles. Her makeup resembles Wan Hua, and although her voice is not bright, it is still sweet and mellow. Her expressions are delicate, and she has some martial arts skills. As for martial arts talents, only Wang Guotian is barely passable. The rest are not worth mentioning. It is rare to see four leading female roles in the same theater.</p>
<h3>Xi Xiaobo Leads a Troupe South</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>New Year Performance at the Golden Theater</p>
<p>Laosheng Xi Xiaobo and Kun Dan Hou Yulan and their troupe will arrive in Shanghai soon. They are here at the invitation of the Golden Theater. Here is a brief introduction to the troupe:</p>
<p>Xi Xiaobo is one of the best rising Laosheng actors in recent years. Xiaobo was originally a famous amateur actor in the old capital, learning from Yan San. However, his voice is far superior to Jupeng. He was soon appreciated by 梅大王, who invited him to collaborate. He has been Mei Lanfang's Laosheng partner in recent years, and has performed with Mei in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Hanzhou, and other places, receiving great praise. In recent years, Lanfang has been living as a recluse in Hong Kong. Xi returned north and became a student of Li Hongchun, forming his own troupe. In recent years, Xiaobo has also privately studied Wen Ru, taking the best aspects of both Yan and Ma. In addition, his voice is far superior to Yan and Ma. Therefore, he has been able to attract a large audience in Beijing. It is expected that his return to Shanghai will be even more精彩.</p>
<p>Hou Yulan In the past two years, many northern Kun Dan actresses have come to perform in the south, but Yulan is the one who has received the most praise from the public. Yulan is a high-achieving student of the [blank character] Opera School. Her reputation and status at school were not as high as Zhao Jinrong, but after leaving school, Yulan's skills have surpassed Jinrong's. Last year, Yan Jupeng went south and chose Yulan instead of Jinrong to come with him. Sure enough, she became famous overnight. Yulan can be said to be one of the most successful students from the Opera School to come to the south. (She is also one of the first students from the Opera School to come to the south.) After Yulan returned north with honor from Shanghai, she was hired by Xi Xiaobo. Yulan is willing to live under someone else's roof, without pursuing vanity, and to build her own army. She is truly admirable.</p>
<p>Ru Fuhui is an outstanding talent in the clown role from Fu Liancheng. He is skilled at mimicking Xiao Changhua. His reading and performance resemble Old Xiao. He excels at Fangjin clown plays. His voice is loud, and his performance is proper. Compared to Ma Fulu, Ma excels at humorous clown plays, but his Fangjin clown plays are far inferior to Fuhui. Fuhui previously came to Shanghai with Tan Fuying, and his performance was excellent. Laosheng plays must have actors like Fuhui to配, in order to be just right. This time, with Xiaobo coming south and with Fuhui in the troupe, it will surely have the effect of green leaves setting off a peony.</p>
<p>Chen Shengtai This person has never been to Shanghai. He is the only Xiaosheng actor from the fourth class of Fu Liancheng besides Ye Shenglan. He once replaced Jin Zhongren and collaborated with Xun Huisheng. His skills are characterized by stability. In addition to the above-mentioned people, there are also Wang Shaoting, Qiu Shengrong, Gao Shenglin, and others. Wang is 梅蘭芳's old partner, and is a top-notch Lizilaosheng. Qiu and Gao have not performed in Shanghai for long, and people in Shanghai should remember them. I will not repeat them here.</p>
<h3>Art World News</h3>
<p>(1) Amateur photographer Huang Ningmin has been studying black and white photography for many years, with no less than thousands of works, which have been published in various publications. This time, at the invitation of the Republic Middle School, he specially selected more than one hundred outstanding works to hold a personal photography exhibition, which has been well received by the audience.</p>
<p>(2) Shanghai's famous Buddhist painter Qian Huafo is holding a five-day exhibition of Buddhist paintings at the Dashin Company, which opened yesterday (the 20th). In addition to his one hundred proudest works, there are also several thousand valuable items, such as cigarette case chronologies, matchbox worlds, cigarette cards, and Shaolin monk steles.</p>
<p>(3) This month, the wedding of Certified Public Accountant Xue Difu and Ms. Yu Yueying will be held on the 24th at the Xindu Hotel. It is said that many friends and famous amateur opera singers have launched a concert to celebrate. The concert will start at one o'clock. The plays will be "Golden Terrace," "Celebrating the Top Pearl," "Sitting in the Palace and Stealing the Order," "Double Golden Lotus," "Hundred Flower Pavilion," "Determined to Enlist," and the finale will be "Heroes' Gathering," with "Huarong Road." Kunqu opera leader Ms. Wang Xichun will also participate in the performance of "Spring Fragrance Makes a Fuss at School." Famous amateur singers Ni Qiuping and Pang Yuanlong will participate in playing the instruments. A grand occasion can be predicted.</p>
<p>(4) The news published in this publication on the 13th about the Fudan Drama Society rehearsing "Wen Tianxiang" has been found to be inconsistent with the facts. This is a special clarification.</p>
<p>(5) The Art Type Drama Society, since its last performance at the Carlton and Xindu, has been planning a large-scale performance. The plays have been decided to be the French romantic poet [blank character] and the Russian masterpiece "狄叫娘". They are now actively rehearsing and will be officially staged at the beginning of next month.</p>

<h3>Pot-bellied Stories</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>Red-Haired Devil Liu Tang for the Misunderstanding of the Eight-Foot Leg (Part 2)</p>
<p>Liu Tang was originally short in the legs, but was mistaken for being red-haired, and called a devil. It is an injustice. This mistake was a mistake in the "Miscellaneous Records of Xuanhe" at the end of the Song Dynasty and the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty (this book is a copy of a street story), and the "Water Margin" did not change it because of this. Now, storytellers and opera performers all follow the "Water Margin". Later, I hope that the image of Liu Tang on the opera stage will be changed to the shape of the eight-foot leg, but it is difficult to reverse a long-standing situation and it is difficult to change customs. I wrote this article, fearing it would be in vain. Also, White Streak in the Waves Zhang Shun, White Streak mistaken for White Leg; Boat Fireboy Zhang Heng, mistaken for Fireboat Worker Zhang Cen; Golden Spear Class Xu Ning, mistaken for Golden Spearhand; Jade Unicorn Lu Junyi's name mistaken for Li Jinyi; Dragon in the River Li Jun's name mistaken for Li Hai; Match Guan Suo Yang Xiong, mistaken for Wang Xiong. The "Miscellaneous Records of Xuanhe" is later than the "癸辛雜識" ("Miscellaneous Records of Guixin") (the one I have is a Called Edition), so I believe in Zhou Mi's record. Moreover, Mr. Zhou was a well-known erudite scholar in the Southern Song Dynasty, while the author of "Miscellaneous Records of Xuanhe" lost his name and was just a street storyteller. By comparison, it can be concluded. Also, according to "癸辛雜識", there are thirty-six people (that is, commonly known as Heavenly Stars), including Double-Headed Snake Xie Zhen, Double-Tailed Scorpion Xie Bao, Cloud Dragon Gongsun Sheng, and Cloud Touching Du Qian. In "Miscellaneous Records of Xuanhe", there are no Xie Zhen and Xie Bao in the names of the thirty-six generals, but there are Gongsun Sheng and Du Qian. This is another difference.</p>

<h3>A Cross-Section of Germany's Economic Warfare</h3>
<p>— Duxing</p>
<p>The effect of the anti-blockade war is only so-so, and there is no guarantee of the support of neutral countries. It is also quite difficult to obtain supplies from the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The strategy of the Western European democracies against Germany, in addition to the so-called war of nerves and propaganda war, is mainly economic warfare. Germany's method of dealing with this is the anti-blockade war.</p>
<p>Germany's Continental Policy</p>
<p>However, the so-called blockade and anti-blockade wars are only one aspect of economic warfare. Another important aspect is the efforts of both belligerent countries to win the sympathy of neutral countries. Looking at just the corner of the European continent, Germany seems to be copying Napoleon's "Continental Policy" this time in order to deal with Britain. Therefore, at the beginning of the war, Germany placed Baltic shipping under its control, and further attempted to cut off the exports of the Scandinavian countries to Britain. During the war, Hitler recklessly sank neutral ships in an attempt to force Sweden, Norway, and Finland to submit, so that the Baltic Sea's commerce would use the Kiel Canal as its port. However, because the Scandinavian countries were unwilling to abandon their Western European customers, and because Germany was unable to supply them with the goods and raw materials they needed, and because they had to export to Western Europe in order to obtain what they needed, Germany was unable to achieve its wishes. At the same time, even if Germany achieved cutting off Scandinavia's business relationship with Western Europe, their production would stagnate and they would be unable to supply Germany with the products and minerals it needed.</p>
<p>Attitudes of the Nordic Countries</p>
<p>While the Baltic Sea is being controlled by Germany for its exports, it is also being monitored by major countries for its imports. All incoming ships must be inspected by the British Navy. Although Britain's attempt to prevent neutral ships from transporting raw materials to Germany inevitably causes friction with the interests of neutral countries, neutral ships seem happy to accept Britain's inspection. This attitude has greatly angered Germany, which has repeatedly protested this "violation of neutrality" and regarded it as a hostile act. However, unless Germany risks invading the small Nordic countries, it will not be able to call on them to take the same action as it to resist the British blockade. It should be known that overseas trade is the economic lifeline of the small Nordic countries. If Britain controls maritime traffic, they cannot accept Germany's protection.</p>
<p>Competition in Southeastern Europe</p>
<p>As for the position of Southeastern Europe, it should be discussed separately. Germany occupies a position of economic leadership in this region, just as Britain does in Northwestern Europe. Although Britain does not have maritime fortifications to prevent this, it is not easy for Germany to have all the oil, minerals, and food of the Balkan Peninsula countries transported north in a steady stream. First, Germany owes these countries a large amount of money, which it has not yet been able to repay. Naturally, they demand that Germany repay its debts before they are willing to export raw materials and food to it. Second, Britain and France are now buying goods from the Balkan Peninsula countries with cash, making them more demanding towards Germany. Third, Germany can only use goods to represent cash, while the Balkan countries need industrial raw materials, which Germany lacks.</p>
<p>Soviet Support</p>
<p>What Germany is urgently striving for now is raw materials and food. It is working hard on the anti-blockade in order to solve the acquisition of these two factors. After years of preparation, there may not be a panic about food for the time being, but the shortage of military raw materials is an undeniable fact. Regarding obtaining supplies from the Soviet Union, there are also limitations. First, because the Soviet Union's main war resources, such as oil, the Soviet Union does not have a large amount of exports that can be supplied to other countries. Second, what the Soviet Union needs is heavy industrial machinery for its domestic production and construction, and Germany does not have the ability to supply a large amount of it in exchange for Soviet raw materials. Therefore, in fact, there is not much help. Furthermore, Germany feels panicked by the lack of locomotives, and the goods to be transported are piling up. This factor is enough to prove that it is quite difficult to obtain supplies from the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Contemporary Biographical Sketches</p>
<h3>General Chen Yi, Active on the Jiangnan Battlefield</h3>
<p>— Jiang Di</p>
<p>General Chen Yi, currently the commander of the First Detachment of the New Fourth Army, has directly shouldered the responsibility of commanding operations on the front lines of Jiangnan for over a year. He laid the foundation for guerrilla warfare for the New Fourth Army in arduous circumstances, causing the [Japanese] to suffer significant losses and preventing them from doing whatever they wanted in this beautiful land of Jiangnan. This is undoubtedly due to General Chen and the soldiers under his command.</p>
<p>General Chen is from Leshan, Sichuan, and is thirty-nine years old this year. His family was that of bankrupt landlords, so he received a higher education. After the European War, he went to France to study, working while studying and completing his studies. During these years, his thinking was gradually influenced by Marxism, leading him to embark on the path of revolution later on.</p>
<p>In 1923, General Chen returned to China after completing his studies, returning to the embrace of his motherland. In Beijing, he actively participated in the cultural movement. The following year, he officially joined the Communist Party and worked for the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Kuomintang. Later, with the rise of the Northern Expeditionary Army, because General Chen was a Sichuanese, he carried an important mission back to Sichuan to contact senior Sichuanese generals such as Liu Xiang and Yang Sen, to respond to the Northern Expedition. It wasn't until the Chongqing Incident in March 1927, when Sichuanese warlords began to massacre revolutionaries, that he quietly escaped to Hankou and was reassigned as the party secretary of the Central Military Academy. After the split between Nanjing and Wuhan, he followed Generals Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Ye Ting, and others, fighting on the battlefields and participating in several perilous major battles. He was even wounded in the Xingguo campaign in June 1934, and the injury has not fully healed to this day. After the Lugou Bridge Incident broke out on July 7th, General Chen believed that the opportunity to serve the country had arrived. He went to various guerrilla areas to contact and concentrate troops in preparation for fighting for the country. Later, it was decided to establish the New Fourth Army, and he was ordered to concentrate the guerrilla forces scattered in seven provinces and reorganize them. At that time, he was appointed as the commander of the First Detachment, and the day before last year, he arrived on the Jiangnan battlefield.</p>
<p>General Chen has a very tall and sturdy physique, with sharply raised eyebrows and a very heroic appearance. His voice is not very loud when he speaks, but it is powerful and well-organized, able to grasp the core. Moreover, his speech is interspersed with some crisp phrases, making people not feel bored listening to him. He once persuaded a group of stubborn warlords and bureaucrats in a historical negotiation. Recently, he also persuaded a man who was about to defect, and who many people objectively said had already defected—a gentleman with several tens of thousands of fortunes. It can be seen that his eloquence is very good.</p>
<p>General Chen has a high level of knowledge, so his literary achievements are also multifaceted. He often writes novels, essays, and poems after battles, and especially likes to write ancient-style poems. Because his themes are all realistic and stimulating, they have won the love of most people. In a certain civil war, in an extremely dangerous situation, he wrote a "beheading poem" to express his feelings. The poem reads: "What is the intention of the neck being severed today? Founding a career is difficult with many battles. Going to the spring terrace to gather old troops, a hundred thousand heroic ghosts will behead Yama." After he led his troops to Jiangnan and fought with the [Japanese] for the first time, he also composed a poem as above, truly worthy of being a dashing Confucian general.</p>

<h3>Crabs and Floods</h3>
<p>— Yao</p>
<p>"Crabs and floods" may seem irrelevant at first glance, and linking them together may seem almost comical, but in reality, it contains a profound truth. According to the research of Dutch hydraulic expert Von Enlermon, crabs and floods are closely related. The reason is that crabs often dig holes under river embankments to live in, causing the embankments to gradually collapse, resulting in floods and major disasters. He also said that the main cause of floods in various countries throughout history is this point. In other words, every time a flood occurs, the culprit is the "crab general" that moves sideways. According to textual research experts, with the progress of the times and the civilization of society, today's crabs are much smarter than before. No matter how solid the river embankments are, they can destroy and collapse them. The frequent occurrence of floods in recent years is solely due to this. This is truly a terrible phenomenon for our human society.</p>
<h3>Clever Couplet</h3>
<p>— Zhou Jintao</p>
<p>I traveled in the Southwest for six months and recently returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong. According to reports, the morale of the people in the rear is stable and their fighting spirit is strong, beyond what outsiders can imagine. Although enemy planes are rampant, people have become accustomed to it over time. There are many air raid shelters in Chongqing. When an air raid alarm sounds, residents calmly enter them. At the entrance of a large air raid shelter, someone, I don't know who, used a small knife to carve a clever couplet: "Act according to the situation; rest in peace after death." Both lines are idioms, readily available and forming a beautiful structure, which is enough to show composure.</p>

<h3>Schools for the Elderly</h3>
<p>— Ju</p>
<p>Most schools are established for young people. Who would have known that there is a school in the world established for the elderly.</p>
<p>The school for the elderly is in Oklahoma, USA. There are nearly a thousand students, all of whom are over seventy years old—all old men with childlike hearts.</p>
<p>The principal is younger than the students, only seventy years old, but many of the students are over a hundred years old!</p>
<p>The school does not charge tuition fees. The only requirement is that students must be over seventy years old to enroll. The school's facilities are very complete. The principal often gives lectures to the students, and the students often give speeches, sing, tell stories, and play various games on their own. They often retell their past trivial matters to everyone, evoking everyone's cherished childhood memories.</p>
<p>Their common hobbies are growing flowers, reading novels, drawing pictures, and studying music. Each person has their own fun, and they live very comfortably.</p>

<p>Male Lack of Sexual Desire Is Not Necessarily a Pathological Condition</p>
<p>It is often said that a male’s lack of sexual desire is a pathological condition. Some even say that a decrease in a man’s sexual desire can indicate the end of his life! These are shocking fallacies whose purpose is none other than to encourage people to indulge in excessive sexual activity, and their harm is greater than killing with knives and guns!</p>
<p>Our argument: A male's lack of sexual desire is not necessarily a pathological condition. This is because for talented men after marriage, the desire for career often outweighs that for love. Or, because their moral character is gradually cultivated, or because their spouse is not satisfied with them, they may gradually develop a sense of indifference towards sexual desire. However, this does not mean that they are weak or incompetent. This is because, on beautiful nights, when they are in high spirits; or when the couple is happy and playing around, they will surely show their vigor and magnificence, both to delight their own hearts and to comfort the deep and passionate affection hidden in the heart of the beauty. Therefore, this kind of man not only does not hinder love, but also helps love to live eternally!</p>
<p>However, some men who have committed self-abuse, nocturnal emission, early marriage, and rampant indulgence in their early years have greatly depleted their reproductive glands' secretions (i.e., semen). Then, symptoms such as premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, scattered energy, thin semen and infertility, kidney deficiency and brain weakness, and neurasthenia will be endless. This kind of man often has two different manifestations: one is that they cannot find pleasure in sexual life, feel tired of life, and fall into a pessimistic plight, resulting in a lack of sexual desire, which is certainly a pathological condition; the other is that they become excessively lustful due to physical deficiencies. In the long nights of winter, they frequently try to arouse their wives' excitement, but in real sexual life, they are like a flash in the pan, or even completely incapable of performing. How can this not arouse their wives' hatred? Therefore, marital discord, the breakdown of love, and the emergence of elopement, divorce, and other family tragedies are often heard; or the symptoms worsen, leading to premature aging and death.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned symptoms should not be confused with a lack of sexual desire, and thorough treatment must be given as soon as possible to avoid serious consequences! The method of treatment: According to world-renowned doctors and our experience, taking the gonadal hormone preparation "Shengzhishengsu" is the most effective treatment. This agent was invented the earliest, is supervised the most carefully, and contains precious ingredients, including cruciform crystals of gonadal hormones, pituitary gland crystals, deer antler essence, vitamins, and more. Therefore, its efficacy is real, and its restorative power is great, surpassing any similar preparation. After taking it, it can produce essence and replenish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood within one day and night. Continuous use will further promote adolescence, nourish the nerves, and adjust metabolism. The above-mentioned symptoms will surely be cured invisibly in a short period of time, and the energy can be increased and enriched. Regular use by middle-aged and elderly people will prolong life and rejuvenate! However, those who suffer from nocturnal emission must also take the special medicine for treating nocturnal emission, "Ximituoshi Gujing Pian" (available at Wuzhou Taihe, Xihua, Yingdeng and other major pharmacies, priced at two yuan per box) to strengthen the essence gate and prevent leakage. Then, opening up sources and reducing expenditure will yield quick results.</p>
<p>Patient Li Jianfei, a native of Hunan, 30 years old, married for ten years, suffered from nocturnal emission, brain weakness, kidney deficiency, lack of children, neurasthenia and other symptoms. Although he repeatedly took over-the-counter drugs on the market, they had little effect. Recently, the symptoms worsened, and a friend urged him to go to Hong Kong to work, but he was prevented by illness and was extremely anxious! (The above is self-reported) Last month, he came to our clinic for diagnosis and treatment. After a detailed examination of his symptoms, we learned that they matched what he said. We ordered him to purchase two dozen "Shengzhishengsu" and one dozen "Ximituoshi Gujing Pian," so that he could take both concurrently, and administered electrotherapy every other day. In just one month, all his illnesses disappeared, his face turned rosy, his energy was abundant, and his love for his wife was even deeper. It is said that he will take his family to Hong Kong to take up his new position, so in the warm and beautiful southern country, there will be another sweet couple!</p>
<p>In order to promote public welfare, this publication has specially invited famous domestic and foreign doctors from various departments to answer questions about various diseases. Please include sufficient return postage with your letters, and provide detailed information about your name, address, cause of illness, and symptoms.

<h3>Young People Suffering from Nocturnal Emission Cannot Enjoy a Happy Life</h3>
<p>— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>Everyone knows that nocturnal emission is a symbol of physical weakness. If young people suffering from nocturnal emission continue to delay treatment, the degree of weakness will inevitably increase rapidly. The most terrible thing is the brain weakness and kidney deficiency caused by nocturnal emission!</p>
<p>The semen in a man's body is like the oil in a machine, which can lubricate various functions and make them active. The desire for sexual love, in particular, is caused by the activity of semen (i.e., gonadal secretion). Therefore, they choose their spouse enthusiastically, talk about love, get married, have children, and organize a family... opening the brilliant flowers of life and enjoying the infinite happiness of life! If a man suffers from kidney deficiency due to untreated nocturnal emission, then premature ejaculation and impotence will inevitably follow; or nocturnal emission weakens the developmental function. Although they are adults, their sexual organs are still as delicate as children; or their semen is thin, resulting in prolonged infertility. All these symptoms make it difficult to enjoy the joy of newlyweds, let alone the happiness of life. How many young people in the world have lost love and happiness due to this, falling into the tragic situation of the world? There are also many who suffer from weakness and insomnia due to nocturnal emission, affecting their studies and careers, and regretting it in their old age, or even dying young!</p>
<p>The only effective treatment for nocturnal emission is to take "Ximituoshi Gujing Pian." This medicine can indeed strengthen the essence gate and calm the nerves. After taking it, you can achieve the effect of sleep and stopping nocturnal emission on a regular night. However, when purchasing the medicine, patients must recognize the words "Ximituoshi..." to avoid being confused by miscellaneous medicines and delaying treatment. For those who already have the above-mentioned symptoms due to nocturnal emission, they must also take the gonadal hormone preparation "Shengzhishengsu" to cultivate the brain and kidneys, essence and blood, and nerves. Continuous use for one month can increase body weight, strengthen energy, and eliminate all diseases invisibly.

<h3>Remedial Measures for Imperfect Breasts</h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei</p>
<p>Tram tracks engraved on the forehead,</p>
<p>Breasts like empty purses.</p>
<p>No matter how well these women dress up,</p>
<p>Men will still shake their heads.</p>
<p>You should not underestimate a woman's pair of breasts in front of her chest. They truly have infinite magic and precious value. Frankly speaking, the higher and more elastic a woman's breasts are, the more they can fully set off her plump hips and graceful waist, forming a beautiful curve that makes people intoxicated with admiration. At the same time, due to the health of their own ovarian function and the exuberance of metabolism, their temperament is invariably kind and gentle, their skin is invariably crystal clear and white, and their cheeks are invariably rosy and delicate. Such a girl, not only in her virgin era—it can also be said in her school days, because of her superhuman intelligence and character, can be at the top of her class, be the most outstanding student, and be loved by teachers, elders, relatives, and friends. Even once she is married, with these beautiful qualities, won't her husband obey her every word and treat her like a treasure?</p>
<p>However, facts tell us that such women are also the most difficult to find. The only main reason is that women have various physiological differences, such as menstruation and pregnancy. Therefore, many women of beautiful age have many tram tracks engraved on their foreheads, rough skin, and are skinny, and what is especially hard to learn is a pair of breasts, like two dry and瘪的 purses. Such women, even if they are covered in makeup and parade around the streets, are not sneered at by men. If you want to seek a remedy, the most practical and reliable way is to take the female gonadal ovarian preparation "Shengzhishengsu" as soon as possible. The main reason for breast atrophy and loss of beauty is that the ovarian function of the gonads is destroyed by irregular menstruation, vaginal discharge, multiple births and weakness, malnutrition and other symptoms. After taking the female "Shengzhishengsu", the ovarian function can be cultivated and replenished overnight, metabolism can be stimulated, menstruation can be adjusted, and the palace can be warmed and the discharge can be stopped. If you continue to take it, not only can you cure various symptoms, but also make the breasts high, the hips plump, rosy, and stay young forever.</p>
