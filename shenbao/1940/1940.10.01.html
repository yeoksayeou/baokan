<p>重慶　中央日報今日社論論德義日三國盟約、調盟約特對蘇聯取攻勢、蓋德義已公然承認日本在亞洲之領導地位、蘇聯雖在亞洲亦有廣大之土地與利益、而竟完全置之不顧、日本締　此約之動機、乃圖利用德義威嚇英美、俾英美猶豫對日施堅強之壓力、則日本可以全力結束對華爭惟德義兩國今皆有事於歐、實無法在太平洋助日、故該同盟不過紙上空談耳、今料英美蘇三國與亞洲各民族、將早日團結、共同推倒日本之霸權、（三十日路透電）</p>

<p>重慶　據此間所接之消息、華軍仍留駐滇邊政府尙未發開入越境命令、有問政府發言人、華軍將否入越者、據答華軍擬待機入越、惟華軍迄今駐滇邊、以待越南局勢之明朗化、越南之發展、極為混沌、據負責方面消息、越南當局變更態度不下四次、自人亦　變更兩次、故使局外者對於越局、幾不能得正確之觀念、甚至駐華法大使亦未得悉最近發展之情形、法大使甚至營建議渠或將親自到渝、與國民政府討論此事、（三十日路透社電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>國際的各個擊破與總清算</h3>
<p>德義日三國簽訂了盟約之後，本報於前昨兩日，已就盟約的本體，及其與遠東的關係，加以析論，今日更就三國締盟後的國際前途，試加考察。</p>
<p>三國盟約的簽字，是九月廿七日的事；這四天來，三國尙無何種根據盟約的新行動，其他各國亦無何種針對盟約的具體反應。但有數端，有關盟約而值得注意的；（一）美國當局表示，對英國無限制的援助，今後將擴展至澳洲與紐西蘭；對遠東堅持原來政策，即各國對美國人士之合法權利須完全尊重，且尊重美國所參加的一切國際條約與協定，及在貿易上之機會平等；而其國會議員與輿論界則多主張儘量援助中英兩日本；其海軍變更預定分批調回太平洋沿岸的計畫，即是夏威夷移駐菲律賓，此說未經美國當局否認。（二）英國當局公開警告日本，放棄妥協政策；謂英國態度的今非昔比，「日本即將發覺」。（三）中國當局表示繼續抗戰以求最後勝利的決心，絕不動搖。（四）日本當局承認國內一部分的飢寒交迫，締盟係以國運作孤注。（五）德國當局表示荷屬東印度的勢力範圍問題，在盟約中並未提及；至於蘇聯以軍火援助中國，德國不以為與三國盟約相抵觸，故並不阻止蘇聯的繼續援助。（六）蘇聯的當局與保章，對於盟約毫無表示，這是正在靜觀默察中的神情；自從蘇德交歡，英德交戰，回溯這年餘以來，蘇聯每事為德國作不同其分量的張目，則這一次的毫無表示，至少可以視為蘇聯對於三國締盟的鼓勵。</p>
<p>上述六端，是各方面在這四天中比較尤可注意的表見。至於三國締盟後的國際前途，是否分別從這六點而將公約漸次作多方面的開展，目前不必遽作何種肯定而樂觀的推論。絕非或可悲觀，至少至目前為止，三國並未對於國際播種變更形勢的新因素；假說國際形勢有可悲觀之處，亦非三國盟約使然。三國盟約種因甚遠，遠在反共公約之前；而反共公約的成立，亦復早有其淵源，決非突然的偶合。姑從反公約說起，其關係鍵在於德義日三國由需要互相利用，互相勾結，然後訂立一種公約；在那時候，權宜的將公約戴了一頂反共的帽子。在去年八月之前，由反共的形態上，煊染了好多形形色色，虛虛實實的姿勢，有後參加公約的，有隱然同情公約的，是反共，是反蘇聯；究其實際。還祗是三國的互相利用，互相勾結；不但與參加者同情者毫不相干，即是所反的共與蘇亦毫不相干。到了去年八月。蘇德忽爾宣告交合了，似乎與反共公約由矛盾而轉變了，蘇聯若有所得，英法若有所失；究其實際，反共公約的存廢原來並非問題，對共對蘇的親疏始移祗是權宜，關鍵還在三國的互相利用，互相勾結。從這關鍵，適應環境，於是到了現在而化合為這一次的盟約。所以說，整個國際的利害禍福，早受了三國互相利用勾結的影響，未因三國盟約而有所增，有所減。</p>
<p>由此析關整個國際的當前歧途，祗是由各個擊破而分別解決呢？還是促成協力合作而總清算？這原來是每一國家對於動亂中的國際所彷徨的；三國如此，三國以外的各國亦無不如此。三國盟約雖別無新內容，卻使以外的各國，亦可謂使整個國際，逼近於歧途之前，催促了對於歧途的從速選擇。以同盟的一般性質而論，要在協力合作；但三國的意願卻在對於整個國際的各個擊破而分別解決，這是他們的基本原則；不但如此，這一原則非惟三國用以對付其他一切國家，且將最後同樣的適用於三國的彼此之間。而這次盟約的目的，並非積極的協力合作，僅在消極方面希圖阻止他國的協力合作，以掩護其各個擊破而分別解決的侵略。往年不處他國的協力合作，故已成功於非洲的阿比西尼亞，歐陸的捷克波瀾等等；現在以中國與英國為對象，滿望辦到各個擊破而分別解決，但怕他國協力合作，遂結同盟；將來若證實同盟有效，解決成功，當然的再行各自選擇其進攻的對象。蓋必至無法阻止他國協力合作時，於是同盟的大限已到而從事世界大局，接受總清算；這是三國所無可奈何，決非目前締盟的本意。</p>
<p>至於三國以外的各國，如中國，如英國、不願被擊破，不甘受解決，當然樂得多助，樂得與國，但已開始抗戰，且有獨力作戰到底的決心，故無歧途。其他國家如美國，當非昧於大勢而　望倖免於將來為被攻的對象；願有歧途，即援助中國與英國，徐待中英各自　制對方呢？還是直接挺身而出？這二途，皆在協力合作的範疇，但不同其程度。同此範疇，在最近將來發為有效的行動呢？還是徐待大量擴軍計劃完成之日？這二途，不同其時機。蘇聯亦必不昧大勢，不望倖免，但較美國多一層意識；即國族的界限與主義的領域究竟如何化合？究竟能否參透？此歧途也。倘若不獲絕對可靠的保障主義之必能參透國族，其將欣然於協力合作，以遏侵略，而決不坐待各個擊破。這是可以推想而知的。</p>

<h3>歐戰叢談（十）（五）　德國的新軍事學</h3>
<p>本文原作者聶哥森Hoffman　Nickerson是美國的軍略家，在上决世界大戰中，曾服役美軍參謀部。他所著的軍事學書籍甚多，本篇原文載於八月份Harpers’Magazine，茲譯錄如下：</p>
<p>世人所驚異的德國新戰術與新戰略，其實並無神秘之處。反之，其普通原則，凡受過敎育的軍人及留心戰事者，類皆熟悉。至於降落傘部隊的配備及應用，謠傳而未經證實的新武器，詳悄尙有待於將來的探討。然就大體言之，最近德國在法比荷三國的軍事行動，完全未晚波蘭挪威戰役的窠臼。在上述諸戰役中，德軍並沒有想選出什麼奇跡，不過以用兵神速和呼應靈活兩種特長，來完成他們的戰績而已。</p>
<p>新軍事技術的進步，乃上决大戰經騐必然的結果，自一九一八年十一月以來，這樣的軍事理論，各方面早已在研究討論。</p>
<p>一九一四年至一九一八年間幾决戰役，大部分可作爲未來戰爭中何者應改進，何者應避免標誌。上决戰爭是消耗戰取勝。經過一千萬以上士兵及更多平民的死亡，各業的破產，俄羅斯帝國廣大社會的崩潰，德國最後瓦解了。這種戰略所化代價很大，結果戰勝者與戰敗者一樣慘不可言，其價値實屬得不償失。在一九一四年西綫尙未膠着而成塹壕戰之前，德軍曾有機會在馬爾納河一役獲得勝利。四年以後，卽在一九一八年的春天，德軍反攻的戰術又曾給他們一個取勝的機會。可惜德軍對於這兩個機會，都沒有把握牢，而在其間，交戰雙方實力雄厚的步兵砲兵，僅僅從事於毫無効果的互相轟擊，其他一切，都無能爲力。</p>
<p>各國軍事學家，正如普通人一樣，劉於此種戰局，都抱一種同樣結論，以爲此後不能再有這種現象了。德國軍界偉人札克脫將軍，是建設德國新軍的名宿，他在所著的「軍人的思想一一書中，綜述上决大戰所獲得的敎訓如下：</p>
<p>「這樣全國皆兵究竟產了怎樣的成績呢？雖則用盡了全力，戰爭並不是因敵軍在戰塲上受到最後的殲滅而終了；這種戰爭大體上却變爲消耗的陣地爭奪戰，直至交戰國的一方賴以抵抗的資源，人力的補充，原料的供給，以及作戰的士氣，都在對方優越的實力之下，消耗殆盡。但是戰勝國享受了勝利沒有呢？戰爭的結果，消耗如許國力，是吾値得呢？……軍人不免自問，是吾可以想出別種決勝的戰略，同時可避免相持不決的消耗戰？全民皆兵全國皆兵或許已不適用。……全國人民實已運用不靈，指揮不靈，……不能獲得勝利，只有用純粹的武力擊潰一切了。」</p>
<p>從各方面看來，新戰術是在一九一四年至一九一八年後半期戰爭萌芽的。這種發展是由於內燃機應用於機械化部隊，應運而生的便是戰車與飛機。飛機劉於陣地戰，確有其實際的効用，但此種効用却有其限度。至於戰車的成績，實堪驚人。一九一七年康百萊一役中，聯軍初决用以進攻會發揮衝破德軍陣錢的威力，此决進攻，如有適當的兵力協助，可有結柬戰爭的可能。</p>
<p>注重避免流血過多，毀壞過甚，及消耗金錢太鉅的軍事學家，的分兩派。一派是少數派，主張「空軍恐怖論」，其著名的代表是義大利杜黑將軍，他們相信轟炸機的威力。據這一派的意見，轟炸機的突然大舉　擊，最先毀滅敵方的空軍，其决用不加揀別的方法轟炸城市造成平民的恐怖，一夜之間，就可獲得勝利。</p>
<p>此項主張雖獲一部人的信仰，但大多數軍事學家都不加重視。這種多數派，可以美國哈佛大學故敎授卽美國軍事歷史家械　莊師敦爲代表。他在他酌名著「一九一八年戰役雜感」中，曾這樣的說道：「我們從門外漢及一知半解的軍事學家方面，聽到不少關於米來戰爭可用特種武器，如轟炸機來決定的理論。一九一八年各戰役所得的結果却與相反……歷來戰爭中，各種武器的配合，從沒有這樣的重要，也從沒有這樣的困難」。換句話說，各國有思想的軍人及海軍將校，都明白飛機愈强大，其與其他軍事部門合作也愈加重要，而所謂其他軍事重要部門，就是陸軍與海軍。</p>
<p>至以德國悄形而論，一方面因受凡爾賽和的的恥辱，深感憤恨，一方而却受該的之賜，該國軍事學家乃得力於調整現代工業所造成的各種新奇武器。</p>
<p>爲完成這種艱鉅任務起見，扎克脫將軍便擬成未來陸地戰爭的作戰計劃，其內容分爲三種動作。根據他的理論，現在的空軍，旣由專門人員終身服役，應可隨時出動，所以空軍應爲最先動作的實力，其任務首在毀滅敵方的空軍，擊散敵方大軍的集中，阻碍敵方人力與物力的動員，决者　擊敵方城市工廠及給養中心。</p>
<p>其第二步動作規定，空軍出動　擊之後，應儘速繼之以正規軍的全力進攻。陸軍的効率愈高，調動愈快，指揮愈靈，打敗敵軍的機會愈大，如此，可使其立卽求和。其第三步動作說，交戰雙方正規軍在前綫交綏，以求初步勝利的時候，後方卽須趕緊編成防禦兵力。前綫軍隊獲得初步勝利，便可由此種後備軍及給養的接濟，以增加其攻擊力，同時並使敵方增援不及。</p>
<p>歸納起來，托克脫將軍認爲未來戰爭決勝於利用活動性很大的軍隊，這種軍隊又重在精而不在多，更因飛機的補助，効能更大。據他的意見，這種流動性的作戰部隊，出動以後，最好不應再有增援，卽使要增援，數目也很少。</p>
<p>德國新軍建設者扎克脫將軍</p>
<p>似此，我們就可想到去年波蘭戰役的情形了。在扎克脫將軍作戰三部曲所講到的新武器，不過飛機一項。也許那時各種新武器都禁止德國使用，或許是圓滑的普魯士軍人故意避免戰車字樣。這點可以從他的著作中我出綫索。他說，陣地戰雖足使物資較貧弱的一國家，遂漸解體，但軍事的目標却在獲得最後殲滅的勝利，因之，未來的勝利應該從運動戰爭中去我，在這種意義下，那種以運動力見長的軍隊「騎兵」，自不應加以放棄。他所謂「騎兵」，實指飛機，摩托車，裝甲車，坦克車而言。</p>
<p>從上面所述，我們可以看出扎克脫將軍如何注重攻勢戰，這正可代表目前德國軍事理想。德人雖也相信現代防禦戰的力量偉大，但却知道只有攻勢戰能取得眞正的戰果。德國眾事當局明知這是一個難於解決的問題，却仍全力圖之，這便是德軍成功的秘訣了。</p>
<p>在戰爭中，正如其他人類活動一樣，一切思想均須由人去實行。好的軍官，假以時日，雖則可以訓練出好的士兵，但時間的因素是非常重要的。今日的德國軍隊中，官兵都受過嚴格的訓練。這是因爲受凡爾賽條的的限制的緣故，德軍昌額茶少，結果自然是重質不重量了。</p>
<p>迨國社黨政府恢復徵兵制，加緊訓練新兵，又自然比之一切都重要了。世界各國軍事家當時都懷疑，扎克脫將軍所編練十萬精兵，何以能成爲百萬大軍的基礎，而不損害他們的作戰能力。這種突然的擴充和非常龐大的組織，千頭萬緒，完成任務自然很吃力。</p>
<p>新戰術的精義，不僅限於使用新武器，並目還要精兵來應用這些新武器。德軍作戰神速驚人之處，完全得力於此。</p>
<p>德國新兵的訓練所以能節省時間的原因，在於國社黨的勞工役團已給予初步的訓練。那些新兵早已身體堅實，訓練有素，一入軍隊，便可以全部時間，訓練使用武器了。航空隊員則藉民用航空，獲得初步訓練。</p>
<p>全部陸空軍的編練，完全以達到最大運動力及最勇敢的攻擊爲目標。德國參謀部學校所研究的問題，屬於攻勢的有九個，屬於守勢的只有一個。爲使砲隊迅速的援助步兵隊起見，担任運動戰的所謂「戰鬥隊」的編制，就是一團步兵，必有一營野戰輕砲、永遠跟着。</p>
<p>在平時四十二師步兵之外，必有九師機械化裝甲師。每一裝甲師共有官兵的有一萬四千員名及摩托車三千輛。每師分爲三組：（一）偵察組，有裝甲車五十輛及摩托車步兵一連；（二）攻擊組，的有坦克車四百五十輛：（三）佔領陣地組，有摩托化步兵一旅及野砲一團。裝甲師需要較多的技術人員，較多的機械修理人員，發信號人員及迅速修理道路橋樑的工程人員，還須要精勁的戰鬥員。</p>
<p>德國這種裝甲部隊，好像一百年前的穿胄甲的騎兵隊。這些裝甲師團，對於敵方陣錢上有着充分大砲的？不肯輕易進攻，因爲德國戰車，至少　今年五月前，沒有一輛能够抵禦砲火的。他們却是用來突破敵人陣綫上最弱的一點，或向共兩翼包抄，然後在敵人後方，擾亂其陣錢及進擊其司令部。因此，他們重要的作用在於擾亂敵方軍心。一九一四年至一九一八年間的作戰經騐已使德軍曉得此種戰術進行較便，比了大砲轟擊，收效更宏。</p>
<p>但德軍也決不忽視步兵及砲兵的重要。他們的戰術，在使新舊武器，各得其所，何時重用新兵器，何時重用舊兵器，均視當前形勢爲轉移。</p>
<p>德國除在技術上準備外，還進行一種政治的凖備。其實戰爭無非是一種政治的行動，因爲一切戰爭都是兩大人羣有組織勢力敵對行動，每一人羣，都想把一種政策，强制另一人羣接父。卽使完全出於防守的政策也是如此。</p>
<p>德國的政策一直是侵略的。每一國將受德國攻擊的時候，德國總是利用向德國同情的人在內部發動，有系統地使那個國家解體。同時，在研究如何以實際戰爭襲擊敵方外，德國並以突如共來的手段，作政治的襲擊，就是不官而戰。</p>
<p>現在要講德國這柿新軍事學的實騐情形了。德車不開一砲不折一兵侵佔奧地利與捷克之後，其第一目標便是波蘭。</p>

<h3>前晚武昌路槍案　日軍官已殞命　日方大施搜查並無所獲　警務處僅發表簡短消息</h3>

<p>疑團莫釋、惟公共租界警方昨夜已發表關於此兇案之簡短消息、　昨夜十時一刻甫過、武昌路北四川路口有日陸軍軍官一員、突遭不知名之刺客開槍數響射擊、相信刺客係一華人、聞日軍官身中三槍、另一彈擊傷附近人力車夫一人、案發後、蘇州河北岸全區、頓呈緊張、日軍巡邏封鎖各橋標、不准華人來洪南、一面並在浜北遍區</p>
<p>大施搜查、惟刺客已杳無蹤跡、聞截止今晨爲止、日當局仍在偵查中、並無被捕者、據日方消息、日當局宣布今日午後將發表關於此槍擊案之消息、而該軍官乃畢命於私人醫院、而非軍事醫院、</p>

<p>最近公共租界發生電車及公共汽車罷工工潮以後、外界屢屢詢及本局何以並不採取舉動、亦不發表文吿、現在上項工潮、幸吿解決、爰綴數言、用資解釋、</p>
<p>查公共機關對於任何工潮、僅能居間調停、初無强制解決之權、而實施調解、苟爲時過早、則又往往未克收效、故必出諸極端愼重一途、藉免調解之失敗、况工潮一經發生、其情勢變幻莫測、倘於此際發表正式公吿、不特於事無補、抑且有害、甚或因此而使糾紛遷延不決、按諸實際、本局對於影饗公衆之任何大工潮、其中經過之變化情形、罔不刻刻加意注視、一俟時機成熟、本局或工業科固無不樂予調解、此可爲我界內市民吿慰者也、</p>
<p>復决、本局之力量、有利於糾紛之解決者、往往在公衆或發生工潮之關係方面不知不覺之間見其實效、良以本局對於處理工潮所可採取之最有效方法、厥爲邀請超然之社會領袖人士、出面調解、而並不公然涉及本局也、</p>

<h3>鴉片與人生</h3>
<p>子女怎樣孝其父母？妻子如何勗共丈夫？親戚應進何種忠吿？朋友宜作何種鼓勵？</p>
<p>在此時代，處此環境，對於鴉片一物，無論如何不能再吸，而且也決不容許長此因循下去。但是，一般鴉片吸者，雖也個個人知道必須戒除，而且個個人在感覺着危險，痛苦，當其一槍在手之時，決不是逍遙快樂，乃是　愁怨恨。但是，他們爲什麼不去戒除，脫離這種苦海的生活呢？在一般人說起來，固然是吸煙者沒有決心，可是同時還有其他的原因。須知吸煙人大都且有聰明的頭腦，他們未嘗不知道，若不戒除，一個人就完了，沒有幸福，沒有希望，沒有前途。至於他們想得很明白，而依然不肯戒除，除他本人外，子女，妻子，親戚，朋友，也該負些責任。</p>
<p>有些子女，因爲孝敬父母，對於父母的嗜好，不肯勸請戒除，雖然父母要戒，子女因爲父母年老體衰，不許父母戒，有些做妻子的，對於具有嗜好的丈夫，恐怕丈夫受戒時要受痛苦，不去勗勉文夫戒煙。同時親戚朋友們，也往往說那兩可之詞，敎人的意志，反而游移起來。其實，吸食今日的劣質的煙土，身體越吸越壞，什麼戒時的痛苦，戒後的反　，以及戒了煙會生病等等，都是醫師的問題。如果所請的醫師，有學識，有經體，用的是最合理的方法，自然不會再有這種弊病。須知戒煙不是兒戲的。倘使盲目的延人施戒，或胡亂地購服各種藥物，自然煙癮依然存在，疾病反而叢生了。</p>
<p>記者最近因爲戒煙問題，訪問戒煙專家來公亮醫師，現把來醫師的談話，寫在下面，好使人知道戒煙不能生效的原因。來醫師說：戒煙比治病不知要難多少。因爲各人有各人的體質，各人有各人的性情，以及量的多少，　的深淺，與環境等等，也各各不同，故倘沒有豐富的經騐，施用面面俱到的方法，就難得到相當的成績，正所謂失之毫釐，差以千里。所以我（來醫師自稱）戒煙十數年，對於戒煙者，差不多沒有用過相同的方式，那一疊疊的謝函，總算是我的心血的成績。再有一點，我的戒煙，不求迅速，不用打針，也就可見我的苦心，因爲欲速則不達，打針每多流弊，總不及用王道戒法的來得穩妥云。按來醫師的爲人戒煙，具有四大特點，（一）飲食增加，（二）睡眠安穩，（三）大便通暢，（四）精神煥發，在受戒時期，來醫師保證安全康泰，照常工作。並負廓淸餘毒，永不反　的完全責任。現爲取得戒煙者信仰起見，訂有配藥試服的方法。有志脫離苦海者，在正確的意識下，不要再因循和盲從才好。來公亮醫師地址在公共租界白克路二〇八號電話九五一一一號公健醫院內</p>

<h3>金融　美匯再長之可能性　港中行商滙掛七·五元　聞英將取締滬自由鎊價</h3>
<p>美國對華二千五百萬元成立後，對於上海的黑滙市塲，當時是立刻地影響行市上升，雖然德義日三國成立軍事經濟同盟，稍爲給予匯市以相當的打擊，但是美國一方面立刻與蘇聯方面有所接觸，一方面更對日擴大禁運範圍，所以匯市仍是趨向放長的情形。</p>
<p>果然，昨日匯市英金以三·五三一二五收盤，美金以五·六二五收盤，美金鬆勢甚銳，較前週末猛長二一八七五，而在收盤時有按五·六五六二五賣給銀行，銀行方面尙不願意收購。　　昨日美匯所以突長，根本原因固在美國對華有了二千五百萬元維持中國外滙上的需要底貸款，但在中國本身方面說，美匯的商業匯率，中交兩銀行，已經掛出爲七元半，它的計算方式：</p>
<p>現在上海美滙行市，因自由鎊價的三元七角餘，故被投機者抑低甚多，若依上海英匯三。五便士計算，美滙亦應爲五。八六美元。</p>
<p>可知美匯放長，自有其必然性，並且自從美國在外匯上給予中國以幫助，英國頗有意在上海取締自由英鎊的行市，使能一樣照紐的的依法定鎊價做出，俾投機者不能利用滙價。總上所述，可知今後法幣對美滙價，實更有放長可能。（中）</p>
<h3>太平洋形勢急轉　外匯拋賣勢如潮湧</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、匯豐掛牌揭曉仍平、英美滙暗市潛勢步鬆、其因乃人心俱爲種種利空消息所支配、華銀行首先拋出、迨十一時許、英日有緊張消息傳來、投機家亦起買意、但外商英美等行續套轉美英匯兌、價再增高至三元七角五分、均扒先令售出美金、而準口商則力扒三十萬美元、頭寸相抵、一度趨穩、及聞利賣傳說、投機家再起傾塞、上半日內竟共售美金六七十萬元、致鬆勢比英金爲銳、下午初續帶硬、有利吸胃甚佳、沙遜來猛扒美金、曾由五元五九三七五、回至五元半、不久投機家再塞美金三四十萬元、銀行束手、步硬至收市英金三辦士五四六八七五、長〇六二五、美金五元六二五、長二一八七五、全日交易大盛、</p>
<p>美匯鬆勢較英爲銳</p>

<p>沙遜續進未受影響</p>
<p>後市因投機家互相吐塞、開市後卽吿硬化、計售予有利等外行現貨美滙五元六六二五、與五九三七五、其時現先令亦硬至三辦士五一五六二五、嗣經沙遜扒吸、胃形轉定計扒吸外行現貨及十月份美滙五元五六二五及五三一二五、斯時現花旗會喊緊過五元半、奈投機家復來傾吐、潛勢重硬、迨收盤英金三辦士五四六八七五、美滙五元六二五、十一月份英金三辦士五三一二五、美滙五元五九三七五、結果比上週六英鬆〇六　五、美硬二一八七五、</p>

<p>一片拋空聲中　金市釀成絕大跌風　最低見五千七百七十元　　昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、疲風日甚、接連打破六千元至五千八百元三重大關、竟以當日低價相近收盤、緣傳將取締滬市自由鎊價、美匯放畏、更以日來美日關係更見惡化、因之人心愈形頹唐、金號銀樓業等見勢不佳、出籠者頗夥晨開卽降三十五元爲六千〇四十元、嗣經金號吐塞續小三十五元、惟斯時賴銀號撈入、會見回升、但不久釀成盛大賣風中、銀號銀樓業競相出籠、金號續有塞出、加之午後某證券幫伸向拋空加碼、雖不乏乘賤者扒進補空、但無濟於事、愈做愈小、晚收前出現五千七百七十元低價、結果亦僅五千七百八十元、較上週末猛跌二百九十五元、收後塲外曾小達五千七百六十元、但最後吿穩、五千七百七十五元有人買進、全天交易的六千兩、銀樓飾金連小三十元、海關金等仍小、</p>
<p>烚赤一瀉三百元</p>
<p>晨初人心散漫無勁、開市卽撳三十五元、金號出證券幫二十兩、爲六千〇四十元、繼因金號與散戶拋出、續小三十五元、錢兌業吐予證券幫十兩、爲六千〇〇五元、旋賴銀號幫撈入、回升至六千〇三十五、此後證券幫金號競向吐賣、加之匯市鬆硬、立跌至五千九百七十元、後賣者轉少、證券幫銀號獲利補空、曾回高至六千〇十元、卒因此　外匯愈鬆、賣風復起、金號銀樓幫求售允切、收盤前竟慘落至五千八百六十五元收盤、宰錢兌業維持、遂吿五千九百元、午後賣者仍湧開市卽撳二十元、銀號出證券幫十兩、爲五千八百八十元、嗣因金號傾向吐出、再加某銀號追跡力賣、不久卽跌達五千八百二十元、後匯市止鬆稍定、銀號幫及證券幫搜買不已、未幾曾回漲至五千九百元、終因外匯復走鬆勢、高價難以久站、另一證券幫首來在塞、不久銀號亦反進爲出、晚收前遂被壓小至五千七百七十元、惟收市則吿五千七百八十元、結果比上週末在跌二百九十五元、全天二百七十元差度、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金亦連小三檔</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時不動、迨十時二十分掛小十元、午後二時半又跌十元、傍晚四時再跌十元、計大同行改懸五百九十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣暴落</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、初尙平穩、嗣忽謠傳英日有緊張消息、烚赤直錢　降、英美金鎊因亦暴落七元、英金票一跌卽回平、美金票以黑市美滙大鬆、各方供給奇旺、晚市退至十七元五角八分、比上日猛降七角七分、香港票趨勢軟弱、市價略疲、日金票及朝鮮票均不乏供給、市價一致趨軟、前者降爲一元四角九分、後者退至一元一角六分、</p>
<h3>九月份匯劃存息</h3>
<p>上海銀行業聯合準備委員會、茲定九月份同業滙劉存款息、爲每千元三元五角、（卽合月息三厘半）、較八月份减低一元、</p>
<h3>糧食　大囤戶操縱大衆糧　無法無天竟無有加以制裁　但看來源洋米又到二萬包</h3>
<p>洋米市自週前午後一度回軟後、中間雖隔星期休業一朝、而人心又承前勢、未敢驟進、早開形勢殊疲、賣多於買、極爲混沌、蓋愼記洋行之定貨五千噸已經證實、價七十九元半、其他華洋商尙有三五千噸在接洽中、因此洋米開價立小元外、雖在國米飛騰中、而市面終呈軟弱、及至午時、投機商又放謠言、利於貨方、人心叉爲浮動、而投機操縱更形活躍、無法無天、竟無有加以制裁、因此午後黑市又見扒起一二元、一號西貢七十三四元、火絞七十二三元、二號西貢早市六十六七兀、午後昂至六十八九元、二號暹邏早市六十五元者、午後至六十七元七八角、英華司原包早市七十九元至七十九元半、下午又至八十元、二號暹米早市七十八元半亦在下午喊高一元、然至近晚又聞行號與洋行繼續接定貨、倘今日滙水立定或再長、則定貨必可成交、市價亦可回小也、全日成交原包英華司三四百噸、現米近一萬包、</p>
<p>糯米仍呈供求相仿、久無變動、金溧特元猶七十二元、常丹貨七十一元至七十元、香港相同耳、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米到貨續斷、致滬埠所有一些之陳貨、頓如奇寳、視局拱璧、一遇問津、喊聲在增、漫無標準、恒有數元之巨、而作客爲應付鬥市計、亦不得不認受相購、致昨又增二元之砠、常普粳售九十元、决至蘇崑宿粳八十七元半、南港斛見早稻鮮自九十元、决至八十八元、</p>
<p>新粳尖聞內地脚踏車爲特殊環境所阻、致米不得運申、來源杜絕、而去路反漸擴張、於是形成供不敷求、價再飛漲二三元、顓橋新粳開八十元、太倉嘉定洋尖七十一二元、靑角杜尖七十四元、</p>
<p>近日米市又因越南問題、一般大有資力之囤戶乘機操縱、致米價飛騰、又造新紀錄、查洋米自越直接運來較少、但由香港運來者、並無間斷、其數亦鉅、昨日有怡和洋行明生輪由海防直接運來一萬一千二百十七包、又由香港裝來七千零二十六包、該輪共裝來一萬八千二百四十三包、昨午抵滬、停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、叉該行利生輪、於昨晨到滬、亦由香港裝來洋米一千四百十包、同靠　斯福碼頭起卸、（祖）</p>
<h3>粉市平淡　內地幫略辦小麥</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日父易平淡、查一號粉廠盤仍爲十六元五角之價、一時未必更動、各廠以洋麥原料雖有抵埠、尙未增高生產、故供給數量、亦未能逾越限定、統市由阜豐批出五千包、福新批出三千包、及客幫零銷二三千包、客盤仍須上八元以上、惟傳英日有交惡消息、金市暴落、人心欠佳、故老車回籠貨行情鬆至十七元四角、鳳凰牌現粉十六元半、均祇少數父易、又聞本街辦進僧帽牌洋粉二百包、價爲十八元二角云、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日市况依然平穩、華廠與日廠進胃均見呆懈、而供源亦屬稀寥、堪稱供求兩寂、惟聞內地幫辦去太倉新麥一百包、因係送到租界交貨、價須二十五元五角、比前較升二三角、</p>
<h3>證券　內債勁俏逾恒</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨市因環境之變化多端、各種市况頓起激烈震動、債市利多爲甚、故上漲之勁俏、突飛猛進、各種均發現八一三後之第一决最高紀錄、惟以一時直綫上騰、惹起浮多獲利了結、致下午收盤時驟小三四角、但形勢仍未必卽有回風、目下銀行存款减息問題、漸見普遍化、英美對華之援助、已公開化、中國處此龐大洪爐中、確處於有利地位、債市前途、有進無退、大漲小回、則所難免、昨日上午賣氣雖盛、但仍未能及買方之熱烈、午前丙種卽衝出七元、乙種衝出九元、丁戊種均衝出六元、均發見最近新高價、午後漲風允勁、全部又發見八一三以後最高紀錄、惟以漲風過速且猛、引起浮多獲利之斬結、收盤時致回鬆三四角、但結果仍漲五角半至一元　角、成交總數、共計的一百萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交南洋兄弟烟草公司股一百股、均爲十七元二角五分、</p>
<h3>紗花　棉紗跌風　午後始盛　雙馬尙開一千一百元</h3>
<p>紗市始漲繼跌、且上下範圍日見擴大、此因多空兩方心神不一、所以雙方父至肉搏階段中、買方議論謂原棉禁止搬運、廠方原料困難看好、賣方因時局不佳、外滙步鬆、黃金在落、且存紗依然濃厚、而價格比低峰時已暴漲二三百元、照此拋空者頗不乏人也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、因多方團結在抬、一鬨冲到二十支雙馬一千一百四十元、豈料高價一現、獲利了結者及拋賣者驀地而起、一時籌碼較爲鬆懈、市情軟化而下、一般多方竭力支持、旋經外滙突長、金市不支、　多出檔、市盤乃不穩而下挫、跌至一千一百〇九元收盤、查半日間成交統計三千八百七十包、行情二十支雙馬漲二元、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左</p>
<p>、　　同行三、二〇〇香港六七〇統計三、八七〇</p>
<p>午後紗市忽跌十元、在紗布，交易所中做開行市、二十支雙馬廠單價爲一千一百元、成交計一百十包、買方係大戶、賣出是獲利出籠者、</p>
<h3>美印棉價　漲跌異趨　本棉則軟化</h3>
<p>現棉情形叉入呆滯靜寂之途、此因印棉塊角旣跌、而外棉鬆長允甚、因之市態軟化、但有一部份因各路來源受阻、對於棉價不堪回小也、現棉成交僅盛和號進米特林一百件、價爲二百八十二元、係　交、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐的綿市市况堅定、先因投機者之購進、後因現貨商及華爾街之收買、結果收盤價格、較之上日漲七八磅音、印度市况軟弱、昨降落四雜比、</p>
<p>滬埠外綿交易、日來殊形熱鬧、廠方因鑒於長絨棉之來滬不易、故粉向各方搜購現貨、故是項原棉售價殊爲悄働、同業搜購亦頗踴躍、一般預料　如局勢不發生特別變化、棉價將繼續上漲也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　粵港面銷大盛　售盤無甚榮辱</h3>
<p>國布　昨布市以實銷尙佳、故雖黃金猛落、售盤仍能維持平衡、粗布細布均無榮辱、細斜則以籌碼不多、轉形堅挺、粵港帮辦色布色斜益旺、成交一萬餘疋、木街同業心思良好、續辦各貨五六百件、</p>
<p>東布　晨西午跌、龍頭細布因投機商傾賣、每疋回跌七角半、中檔細布與細斜客銷仍旺跌三角半至五角、蓋以實銷而論、市價外鬆內緊、龍頭細布收盤爲三十三元九角、嗶嘰九角七分牛、</p>
<h3>大衣呢貨缺價貴</h3>
<p>大衣呢邇來趣勢大俏、可謂新近呢羢門中之冠售價亦甚昂貴、蓋市塲中不論好醜各色大衣呢存底缺乏、自去歲歐戰發生迄今、定到寥寥無幾、且爲環境關係、不能訂定、偶有定落者、往往輪行母定、到埠悮遲半年不等、雖有定者而其到吾難測、查其他呢羢嗶嘰、申地製造紡織者甚夥、惟大衣呢、申地呢絨廠商、母論華·英·日諸工廠、齊無能力紡製、故一無出品、致軋缺而步俏、價乃昂漲矣、</p>
<h3>糖市食糧紛紛回跌</h3>
<p>昨糖市以外滙放長、趨勢續鬆、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白本棧七十八元八角、小七角、外棧七十八元半、小五角、荷綿白BS嘜七十五元、荷赤現貨降元半、爲六十元、太古車白B嘜初降半元、繼仍回至原價、爲七十五元至七十六元、DY嘜七十四元、小三角、HHX嘜七十三元半、小五角、國糖到存俱稀、無甚更動、亦乏成交、查搪昨日由香港來九百零五包、</p>
<h3>南北貨　府紅棗首盤已開　桃肉木耳價回漲</h3>
<p>府紅棗新貨前後共計六十八包、昨已到齊、當卽開出、價爲四十四元、較陳貨高起五六元之譜該貨聞　爲廣幫購定云、　新桃肉自跌價後、多時未開、茲已回緊、近到一百六十簍、昨市開至二百元、如數分通、漲起二三十元、</p>
<p>黑木耳前市漲後會見回鬆、退至四百元關內、但終以存底單薄、現在復趨高漲、商邱耳曾開至四百四十八元，四川耳史喊至五百元、雖未成盤、然堅緊可知、行盤普通貨售四百元至四百三十元、普通魁耳售至六百四十元、漲度更甚、</p>
<h3>雜糧　新黃豆米來源受阻</h3>
<p>邇來黃豆市况、新陳略起互異、出口銷塲平凡、本街去路亦懈、因大衆手內都有積貨、故陳豆市勢較軟、惟新豆來源雖有漏網之貨、然根本被阻、市風頗俏、刻下人心雖一致看好、但如步米市後塵、恐遭物議、所以未見若何瘋在之市、昨計成交靑島豆七百包、價爲三十五元二角至五角、南京豆二車、價爲三十三元八角及三十四元、桑園豆四百餘包、價爲三十四元五角、崇明沙黃一百三十餘包、價爲三十三元二角、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>編者前言</h3>
<p>婦女究竟應該上那裏去，是當前一個關係重大的社會問題，也是今日婦女的切身問題。本刋在選登了『妻的犧牲』與『不是犧牲』兩文以後，又接到一部份讀者的反應，現在特選刊「正視婦女問題」，『是不是犧牲』，『不能同意』，（此篇下决刊出）和嚴正先生的『不僅「感慨」而已』等叫篇。我們覺得各位作者的動機與態度都很好，這是値得欣幸的。關於這個問題如果還有其他讀者（允其是女讀者）可能貢獻有意義的意見，我們也樂予發表的。——編者</p>
<p>婦女</p>
<h3>正視婦女問題</h3>
<p>— 沙源</p>
<p>本刊於八月十七和二十六兩天，先後刊載了「妻的犧牲」和「不是犧牲」兩文，而作者都是「有婦之夫」，當然　，所談的是比較地切身和眞實的。在下則是「光棍」，其中妙處，是還不會領略的，但這，却不是說我沒有資格來參加這一討論，相反的，任何一個中華兒女，都有說話的權利與義務，而這裏更重要的是佔我們全人口半數的婦女，應該自己起來討論這一個切身的問題。我想，本刊的編輯先生總願意在可能範圍內予以刋載的吧。同時，更盼望這一問題能引起廣泛的注意和論爭，因為這問題是現實而重要的。</p>
<p>誠然，像這兩位原作者所說，前者的夫人的「犧牲」，和後者所認爲他的太太過着有意義的家庭生活，這兩點，我們不能吾認，在現實社會上是存在着的，而且有着很大的一個數字的婦女，是生活在這種情况之下。因此，我們對這問題，應該加以正視，而不是忽略和吾認，更不是故意的漠視和抹煞。吾認這現實的容易成爲幻想，而抹煞這存在的，將變爲「阿Q式」的消極和退讓！</p>
<p>同時，兩位作者的缺點，前者是被「情感」與「傷心」所控制，在現在社會灰暗的道途上，找不到出路；而後者的錯誤，則有女子在家庭裹，除了料理家務與敎育孩子之外，其惟一的「神聖」使命是「安慰丈夫」（免使丈夫消極）的論調，而反面的顯示便有着以「男子爲中心」的「唯我獨尊」的氣概，這種想法是要不得的，而且簡直是罪惡——把我們全人口半數的女子的力量，予以一筆勾消了！</p>
<p>假如說「希特勒式」的「女子應該回到廚房裏去」的口號要適用的話，那禾，在中國，至少還得換上一個社會，因爲中國的女子還沒到跟男子來爭奪飯碗的時候，相反地，我們還得提倡女子到社會上去。允其，我們要看淸楚的是，未來的社會將是怎樣的一種社會，是不是仍是回　到資本主義和帝國主義的經濟恐慌的浪潮中去，而怕婦女來「侵佔」了男人們的地位呢？還是說，建設新的中國是需要着二萬五千萬女同胞的力量的？假如回答是後者而需要女同胞的力量的話，那末，卽使退一步講——消極一點說，現在也該是埋頭準備的時期——準備怎樣來迎取從瓦礫堆中成長起來的新中國。有人說敎育自己的孩子何嘗不是爲了將來的準備呢？不錯，這是一種，但這只是替你的孩子準備，而你自己是吾能迎合新的需要，或者說，我已經我到了替身——孩子，而我老了，可以不管了，這種見解是吾正確，讓讀者們自己去辨別吧！何况，孩子們的訓練，有着更廣大的集體訓練的塲所——學校，它總比家的生活圈子要大得多，對孩子總不會是壞的吧</p>
<p>至於說爲了安慰丈夫，那末這位丈夫在今日所抱的人生觀，其本身就有問題，更不談其他了。</p>
<p>所以，兩位的作品，現實是現實的，可是不是新現實的內容——它祇看到問題的表面現象，而沒看到問題的本質和它的發展，因此一位就覺得感傷，而另一位就不得不憑自己的卞觀來想象了！</p>
<p>可是，問題的解決，我們覺得，在這過渡時期，是苦悶的。但是，事情是不會送上來的，做，還得需用自己的努力去爭取的，而婦女問題的獲得合理的解決，無疑地，是要在整個民族得到解放的時候，因此，現在的準備，也就應該適合將來的需要，吾則，要理想的兌現，而自己則「坐等豐收」，那末，日子將更加長了！而且也不會輪到不做事的人，同時，假如，不爲總的去努力，那末，婦女也就永遠不能翻身</p>
<p>歷史的輪子是殘酷的，要是不跟着跑，你將會落伍而受淘汰！</p>
<p>隨筆</p>
<h3>是不是犧牲？</h3>
<p>— 蕭雲</p>
<p>在前幾天的自由談上，嚴正君說他的妻婚後「開始埋在家庭的瑣事中……輾轉在菜塲上，廚房裏，臥窒中」，認爲這是一種「犧牲」，而陳銘君夫婦却「以爲一個女子在家裏料理家政和照顧兒女，也是一種事業」，「不是一種犧牲」。</p>
<p>究竟是不是犧牲呢？</p>
<p>我以爲問題的關鍵完全在於對現社會制度看法的不同。</p>
<p>一個對於現社會制度（也就是過去的社會制度）沒有不滿的表示，以爲現狀可以繼讀維持下去的人，必然地覺得女子治家是天經地義的，不是一種犧牲；反之，你如果對於現社會制度覺得不滿，以爲需要改造一下，使婦女也能直接對社會有所貢獻，那麼，你將認爲把婦女限制在家庭的圈子裏是一種不合理的重大的犧牲了。</p>
<p>因此，問題是很簡單的：這個社會制度是不是合理的？資本主義的男性中心的社會是不是應該永遠存在下去？婦女是不是跟男人一樣，也能對神會有所貢獻？如果使婦女受同等的敎育，使他們有機會島社會上來，他們對社會的貢獻是不是比單單治家大？</p>
<p>是不是犧牲？標準就在這裏，請你自己看吧。</p>
<p>雖然是將來的事，可是不是近視的人應該要看得到！</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小靑著</p>
<p>霍桑縐着變眉，搖頭說：「你誤會了。他的冷笑，祇是我煩惱的誘因，那主因還在案子的本身。……唉，這案子眞複雜哪。」</p>
<p>「雖然，現在這案子不是將近結束了嗎？」</p>
<p>「結束，那不但不近，還差得遠呢！」</p>
<p>「我眞不懂。這三個人嫌疑人旣然都已捉住，眼前的工作，祇須想一個方法叫他們一一實供——」</p>
<p>霍桑忽把夾着紙烟的右手搖了一搖。「這樣容易？包朗，你別心急。這伴案子決不是像你所估量的那麼簡單，至多祗可說完成了一半。須知你所說的三個嫌疑人，也許終於「祇有嫌疑』，那你怎麼能够馬上結束？」</p>
<p>我放了紙烟，驚異道：「什麼？莫非道三個人都沒有打兇的可能嗎——連那趙伯雄也沒有可能嗎？」</p>
<p>霍桑丟了烟尾，答道：「眼前我們要研究的，已不是可能問題，而是事實問題。老實說，在事實上我却沒有把握。那有什麼用？」</p>
<p>我覺得霍桑的話太含糊而且太突兀，眞使我想像不出。可是這時我的發問的機會又被阻擾，電話的鈴聲響了。霍桑忙站起來去接話。這電話的結果，似乎並不曾加重他的煩悶。因爲他回到沙發上去時，他的臉上的肌肉好像比先前鬆弛了些他。自動地吿訴我說：「這是秦墨齋打來的。他說白醫官已從眞茹回來，一兩個鐘頭以內，便可報吿我剖騐的結果。」</p>
<p>他的說話剛完，門鈴又接着響動，不多一回，施桂已領了姜安娜進來。</p>
<p>伊已換了一件純藍色的印度綢頎袍，手裏提着的一隻手夾，也同樣是藍色的，嘴脣和面頰上的紅色，也已减除了不少火氣。　（一二三）</p>
<h3>不僅「感慨」而已</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>在今天的『自由談』上讀到陳銘先生的大作『不是犧牲』，欽佩之至。</p>
<p>記得我的寫『妻的犧牲』，完全是有感而作。當時激於情感，無暇仔細推敲，就直率的寫下來，不周之處，當所難免</p>
<p>意外的是竟因此引起陳銘先生的反感。或者說是反應讀『不是犧牲』文，覺得字裏行間，勝我多多，察其寓意，似乎和我的也差不多。不過，當時我用『像妻一樣作了犧牲的，父不知有多少哩！』作結語，實在不僅是『感慨』而已。因爲現作擺在西服們眼前的是分明的二條路：到社會去，或者可家庭去！我總以爲目前婦女們的還得回到家庭裏去，那是現社會制度的缺陷。我的結語所暗示的是對這個社會制度予以攻擊，卽使是微弱的！而陳銘先生只看到『犧牲』兩個字，以爲對這問題不應該如此理解，並且還說『處理家務，敎育子女，是女子的事業。』他是輕輕的把那缺陷掩過了！</p>
<p>我不贊成希特勒的把婦女們趕回家庭裏去。所謂『本位救國』，我覺得也只是暫時的辦法。我是屬於『反對維持現狀派』的。</p>
<p>鄙見如此。也許是因環境不同，以致所見各殊。在我，假使我的孩子們有良好的寄托處所，我要竭力的促使內子做一些社會上的事業，忽忽，此佈，順請鐸安！後學嚴止</p>

<p>㳺藝界</p>
<h3>十月戲劇運動</h3>
<p>— 森自渝寄</p>
<p>自由中國的生氣</p>
<p>自由中國的十月戲劇運動，據各方報導　　　　　　蓬勃地揭露着：</p>
<p>陪都</p>
<p>今年行都戲劇界紀念戲劇節，除了第三屆戲劇節演出委員會決議，由「中國萬歲」，「怒吼」。一中宣部實騐劇團各出多幕劇一個以外，「中國萬歲劇團」同時更從事排練陳白塵的「秋收」，夏衍的「心防，馬彥祥的一國賊」，宋之的「鞭，老舍的「張自忠」，曹禺的「北京人」，郭沫若的「戚繼光」，和陽翰笙的「新雙城記」，「草莽英雄」，「江南之春」等十個大劇，預備在陪都展開更廣泛更熱烈的戲劇運動。</p>
<p>韶關</p>
<p>廣東省政府在八月組織成立的戰時藝術館，自經舒湮担任講師後，頗多規劃改進，因此，劇運也異常普遍。同時，廣東戲劇月會爲響應「劇人號」獻機運動，現經決定在十月戲劇節聯合公演話劇，當地藝人，亦已應允參加演出。</p>
<p>昆明</p>
<p>戰後，昆明劇運頗不落寞，大小劇團成立的已達十多個，除了最著名的南開·淸華·北大同學所組織「聯大劇團以外，同時尙有一同濟劇團」，「雲大劇團」，「藝師劇團」，「金馬劇團」，「海戀劇團」，「業聯劇團」，「國防劇社」，以及于斌主敎所主持的「益世劇團」等，每個劇團都附設有鄉村演劇隊，爲了越南局勢變遷，十月戲劇運動，將專事注重於鄉村巡迴表演，以期深入民間。</p>
<p>貴陽</p>
<p>由於越南局面變遷，昆明形勢相當緊張，政府機關相率疏散，於是貴陽頓時更熱鬧起來，貴陽各界，原定於十月戲劇節由郵務公會公演話劇，響應募款購機運動，現在則亦因此而變更計劃，預備由戲劇界中遴選劇本，輪流合作，在黔省各地演出。</p>
<p>吉安</p>
<p>自南昌淪陷後，吉安便成了江西全省的行政中樞，繼新聞界寒衣勸慕運動而起的「劇人號」獻機運動，吉安戲劇界自然也不甘落後而接着在開始發動了，在那裏，話劇·平劇·地方劇·已取得一致的步伐，向十月戲劇運動邁進。</p>
<p>此外如桂林·永安·金華·成都·延安各地，戲劇界爲了從事十月戲劇運動，亦已分別在籌備中，這在我國戲劇史上，無疑地將留下一個光明的奇跡，而値得大書特書的。</p>
<h3>海締拉摩離婚</h3>

<h3>好萊塢影人抵滬記</h3>
<p>— 鏞</p>
<p>阿爾台孚。（Al　Doff）是環球影片公司的代表人，最近剛由紐的經好萊塢抵達上海。日前曾向本市外報記者發表談話謂：　自英德開始作戰以來，美國影片在歐洲的市塲，當然不免受到相當影響，可是，倫敦的銷數却較柱昔爲增加；其他，遠東方面亦頗滿意」</p>
<p>接着，他又說：「各公司現在對於攝片的工作皆孜孜不倦，這是一種極好的現象；卽以環球而論，本月內共有十二張影片同時在攝影塲上開拍，打破了本公司歷來的記錄；續後準備拍的還有六張，每張預定將動用資本一百萬元。不過有一點要向各界聲明，卽攝製戰爭片雖然近來影圈內很盛極一時，然而各製片人是並不怎樣興奮；所以，此類出品日後必定會逐漸絕跡了；有則大多是一般私人機關自己的資本所拍攝的。</p>
<p>台孚還提出了二件重要的事情：「本年秋季是美國總統競選之期，好萊塢照例要爲此事而發行號外的新聞片；今年則更特爲每個候選人專攝幾卷。第二件是好萊塢人才的事，新出茅廬的果然不少，但是仍感到不够調度。」</p>
<p>最後談及狄安娜竇萍的新作“Spring　Parade”，台孚以非凡的熱忱鄭重介紹。希望影迷們於上映時不耍錯過。</p>

<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Discusses the Tripartite Pact Between Japan, Germany, and Italy: It Cannot Affect China's Policy; China Works Hard to Fight for the Legitimate World Order; Absolutely Does Not Recognize the So-Called Greater East Asia New Order</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Foreign and domestic reporters asked Minister Wang about the attitude China would take regarding the alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy. Minister Wang's response was as follows: The three countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan signed an alliance in Berlin on September 27th. In it, Japan recognized the leadership of Germany and Italy in establishing the (European New Order), while Germany and Italy recognized Japan's leadership in establishing the so-called (Greater East Asia New Order). It is very clear that this provision completely disregards the legitimate status, rights, and interests of other countries in Europe and Asia, as well as the legitimate status, rights, and interests of countries outside of Europe and Asia in Europe and Asia, and attempts to destroy them. The Chinese government's long-standing goal has been to uphold the legitimate international order, so that all countries in the world can get along with each other on an equal and friendly footing. Regarding all (new orders) that are used as excuses to carry out aggression and undermine the legitimate world order, the Chinese government will, in accordance with its consistent policy in the past, resolutely oppose them. The Chinese government and people are determined to continue working hard to fight for the legitimate world order. The Chinese government absolutely does not recognize the so-called (Greater East Asia New Order), and even more so cannot recognize Japan's leadership in the so-called Greater East Asia. The agreements signed between other countries not only cannot affect China's legal status, rights, and interests, but also cannot in the slightest affect the attitude and policy of the Chinese government. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing – The Central Daily News' editorial today discussed the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, stating that the alliance is particularly aggressive towards the Soviet Union. Germany and Italy have openly recognized Japan's leadership in Asia, completely disregarding the fact that the Soviet Union also has vast territories and interests in Asia. The motive behind Japan's signing of this pact is to use Germany and Italy to intimidate Britain and the United States, so that they will hesitate to put strong pressure on Japan. This would allow Japan to devote all its efforts to ending the war against China. However, Germany and Italy are now preoccupied with matters in Europe and are unable to assist Japan in the Pacific. Therefore, this alliance is nothing more than empty talk on paper. It is expected that Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the various Asian nations will soon unite to jointly overthrow Japan's hegemony. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing – The National Government will issue a statement today announcing China's attitude towards the military alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Ta Kung Pao published an article advocating that China immediately recall its ambassador to Germany. The newspaper stated that "Hitler and Ribbentrop have never respected the friendly relations between China and the German business and military communities. Two years ago, Hitler recognized [Manchukuo] and recalled Trautmann (the German ambassador to China) and the German military advisors, and stopped selling arms to China. The National Government not only tolerated these actions by Germany, but also sent an envoy to Germany to consolidate Sino-German friendship. China asks itself, has it done anything to offend Germany? Today, Germany has recognized the Greater East Asia Order through the [Tripartite Military Alliance]. Although it may be impossible for Germany to provide material assistance to Japan as a result, the alliance has demonstrated Germany's hostility towards China. How the National Government will adjust Sino-German relations, we do not yet know. However, at the very least, we believe that recalling the ambassador to Germany as a sign of protest is necessary."

<h3>Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao Discusses: Britain Should Aid China; Open the Burma Road as Soon as Possible; The Blockade Policy Cannot Change Japan's Attitude Towards Britain; The Sino-British-Burmese Cultural Associations Will Express Their Views</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao stated to visitors that he believed Britain would reopen the Burma Road soon. He said that Britain must recognize that this blockade of the road will not affect Japan's hostile attitude towards Britain. Therefore, Britain should aid its friend China, rather than helping Japan, which is not joining the British defense line. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao stated yesterday that he believed Britain would quickly reopen the Burma Road to allow the passage of weapons for the Chinese army. It is said that Britain must now understand that compromise cannot change Japan's hostile attitude, which has been proven by the new alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan. Ta Kung Pao stated that Japan's recent actions have released Britain from its treaty obligations to Japan. Whether for moral or legal reasons, Britain must immediately reopen the Burma Road. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing – It was previously reported that various British aid-to-China groups had sent representatives to petition the Foreign Office to unconditionally open the Burma Road. Recently, the aid-to-China committee also mobilized the general public to send letters to the British government requesting this, which has deeply moved the Chinese people. Hang Liwu and Chen Xiying of the Sino-British Cultural Association recently sent a telegram in their personal capacity to Ms. 作萊, the former president of Oxford Women's College and leader of the aid-to-China groups, to express their gratitude and ask her to convey it to the various groups. It is also rumored that the Sino-British and Sino-Burmese cultural associations will jointly send a telegram to the aid-to-China committee with the anti-aggression association, the National Diplomacy Association, the League of Nations Association, etc. to express their views.

<h3>Burmese Senate Debates National Defense</h3>
<p>Rangoon – Burmese Senator U Kyaw Din of the opposition party moved that while the Burmese National Defense Bill was extremely welcome, its mismanagement had caused dissatisfaction among the people. U Kyaw Din detailed the mismanagement and said that the accusation against former Prime Minister Ba Maw was the result of political rivalry. Prime Minister U Pu spoke against the motion and compared the situation in 1939 with the situation this year, saying that the peace and tranquility seen in the country was the result of the government's efforts to maintain law and order. Burma's wartime relations were now in a very critical state. The Burmese National Defense Ordinance was designed to deal with emergencies, and the government never intended to restrict freedom of speech or oppress the people. However, if anyone conspired to rebel, the government would have to deal with them according to the law. Maintaining law and order was the government's responsibility. The government's handling of Ba Maw was not because he was a political enemy, but because he was obstructing the war effort. After the Prime Minister's speech, the opposition's motion was defeated by a vote of 12 to 8. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>War Breaks Out Between Chinese and Japanese Troops on the Vietnamese Border; Japanese Troops in Southern China Plan to Continue to Hanoi; Rumors of Vietnam Preparing to Move Capital to Seek Strong Resistance; Sumita Appointed Chief of the Japanese Supervisory Group in Vietnam</h3>
<p>Chongqing – On September 27th, a reconnaissance plane flew into Yunnan territory along the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. This was the first time that Japanese planes had used Vietnamese territory. Two teams of Japanese troops entered Vietnam from Dong Dang. Japanese troops are now landing at Lang Son (transliteration) and two locations north and south of Hai Phong. Chinese and Japanese troops are now fighting at Ya Dian (transliteration) near the Vietnamese border. (3rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing – According to information received here, Chinese troops are still stationed on the Yunnan border and the government has not yet issued orders to enter Vietnamese territory. When a government spokesman was asked if Chinese troops would enter Vietnam, he replied that Chinese troops intended to wait for an opportunity to enter Vietnam, but that Chinese troops were currently stationed on the Yunnan border to await clarification of the situation in Vietnam. The situation in Vietnam is extremely chaotic. According to informed sources, the Vietnamese authorities have changed their attitude no fewer than four times, and the Japanese have also changed twice. Therefore, it is almost impossible for outsiders to obtain an accurate understanding of the situation in Vietnam. Even the French ambassador to China has not been informed of the latest developments. The French ambassador is even considering suggesting that he personally go to Chongqing to discuss the matter with the National Government. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo – According to information obtained here, Japanese Army Colonel 青村 has been killed in action in Vietnam. After being wounded on the 25th, he was hospitalized for treatment, but immediately went to the front line and suffered another head injury, which proved fatal. (30th Huitong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The Army Command announced today that Lieutenant General Sumita has been appointed as the Chief of the Japanese Supervisory Group in Vietnam, succeeding Lieutenant General 四原. 四原 was the Japanese representative who signed the Franco-Japanese Agreement on September 22nd. After the Franco-Japanese conflict in Lang Son, he went to request 安騰, the commander of the Japanese army in Southern China, to withdraw troops, but to no avail. He then went to Tokyo to report and returned to Hanoi. Today, he visited the Governor of Vietnam, de Coo. (30th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo – According to a special correspondent for Chugai Shimbun in Hong Kong, it is reported that Thai troops have advanced 40 miles into Vietnam. (30th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Hanoi – News today is that the evacuation of wounded French soldiers from Lang Son is underway, and efforts will also be made to seek the release of French prisoners of war in Lang Son. Franco-Japanese representatives went to Lang Son today to discuss the evacuation of wounded French officers and soldiers. It is estimated that there are about 1,000-2,000 Vietnamese soldiers captured by the Japanese army in Lang Son. Negotiations for the release of these prisoners are expected to be held soon. (30th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Hanoi – The leader of the Japanese delegation to Annam, 西原, and his team returned to Hanoi yesterday afternoon. They may visit the Governor of Annam, de Coo, today. The Japanese side seems to be planning to negotiate with the French authorities again, in order to have a basis for allowing the Japanese troops who invaded Southern Hanoi from the north last week to continue to Hanoi without resistance. It is believed that if the French authorities are forced to grant this request by the Japanese, the capital may be moved to the south, outside the Japanese-occupied area, to seek strong resistance and deal with further Japanese aggression. It is heard that European and American people residing in Haiphong must obtain supplementary certificates from the Japanese in order to travel. (30th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Hanoi – Yesterday, the Haiphong transportation department took down and tore up the American flag hanging on the roof of the American Far East Transportation Company and occupied the company's wharves. This company was engaged in shipping American goods to China through the Annam border before the blockade, without being suppressed by the Japanese. It is heard that this unexpected incident between the United States and Japan in Haiphong was resolved within hours of the Japanese army's invasion of the wharves. The Japanese army apologized to the United States for insulting the American flag and promised to evacuate the wharves. (30th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Vichy – French government officials denied yesterday the British news of the Chinese army entering Vietnam, believing that this rumor was a strategy by British enterprises to divert the attention of various countries after the signing of the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, so that various countries would no longer pay attention to the wavering of Britain's position in Asia. (30th Huitong dispatch)</p>
<p>Annam Front – French troops along the line 75 miles northeast of Hanoi, south of Lang Son, are very active today, preparing to cope with the renewed aggression of Japanese troops from Southern China. However, the front line is quite quiet. French officers said that no shots had been fired in three days, but pro-Japanese guerilla squads often harassed the "no man's land" between the two armies. These guerilla squads are said to include Japanese, Chinese, and Annamese. French troops have received instructions not to open fire easily unless attacked, so they are still strictly following the instructions. However, according to my impression from the French headquarters, the French army is unlikely to repeat the evacuation from Lang Son, and must be fully prepared before moving. The Japanese army occupied Lang Son without attacking in advance, waiting until a large army had surrounded the city before giving the French army an unexpected attack, making it impossible for the French army to resist, and ultimately giving the Japanese army the opportunity to invade. Japanese reconnaissance planes are still constantly appearing over the French army's positions, constantly scouting, and occasionally Japanese search teams, with Annamese as guides, have repeatedly approached the front line. French officers said that they had no search personnel out, so they hoped that conflict could be avoided. However, local troops and French foreign legions have formed strong fortresses at the entrance of the valley here, with two wings forming along the high mountains. Because this small valley is the hub of the railway and highway connecting Lang Son and Hanoi, before the number, when Japanese tank units fired in succession, the French army would blow up the Yuehe railway bridge, causing the Japanese army to make no progress. I visited the French headquarters, which is only a few miles from the front line. French officers were very welcoming to me and provided French bread and red wine to the guests. They lamented the fact that the United States failed to sell airplanes to Annam last June, and recognized that the reason why Lang Son fell into enemy hands was the result of implementing the policy of "I will not attack unless attacked." Because they had always adopted a tolerant attitude, although they were ready for battle, they still hoped until the last minute that the Japanese army in Southern China would change its attitude and stop its attacks on France. The most regrettable thing is that beforehand, the French army in the Lang Son stronghold firmly believed that Major General 西原 could mediate and prevent the actions of the Japanese army in Southern China, but unexpectedly the Japanese army had crossed the border and surrounded Lang Son without anyone knowing. As a result, the city wall fell without a fight. Moreover, the majority of the soldiers in the French foreign legion in Lang Son were captured by the Japanese army when Lang Son fell. About 140 French officers escaped the trap, but eventually escaped. Therefore, all kinds of stories about escaping are told everywhere and are very interesting. According to a report received by the French headquarters, eight French officers were arrested by the Japanese army and attempted to escape, but were discovered by the Japanese army, who then slowly stabbed them with bayonets, stopping after each stab. The eight officers died miserably in succession. Refugees who fled saw the eight corpses lying on the road to Lang Son, covered in wounds, which was heartbreaking. French officials continued, generally speaking, the Japanese army's treatment of French prisoners was not bad. Most stories inevitably have exaggerations. When I was staying at the French headquarters, a local cook came to report that the body of a dead French officer, who was found near Lang Son, had been buried by him out of pity for his exposed corpse. Another officer suddenly came in from outside, looking terrified, saying that he had just escaped from the Japanese. The Japanese were clearly trying to carry out a pan-movement to exclude all "white people" in Annam. French officers said that they had many solid pieces of evidence for the Japanese's intentions. The Japanese are now distributing leaflets there, explaining the meaning of the "New Order in East Asia" and calling on the natives to overthrow the French. But the most important call is to warn the Annamese not to oppose Japan, otherwise there will be unfavorable consequences. The hero of France in this battle should be 勞維梯氏, who intended to negotiate with the Japanese army in Southern China in a friendly manner, but was unexpectedly shot and killed by the Japanese army, failing to achieve his ambition and dying for his country. It is said to be tragic. (29th Special Forces Reporter Jack Jacob dispatch)</p>

<h3>National Government Will Allocate Huge Sums of Money to Aid Students</h3>
<p>Educational circles in Chongqing recently stated that students in Free China are now living on the line of food shortage. It is heard that the National Government will maintain the food supply of university students and youths with 5 million yuan of national currency per year. However, food prices are extremely expensive, so professors are encouraging schools to raise livestock and grow vegetables. Most of the students from the occupied areas have no relatives or families in Free China. If there is no government assistance, they will really have no way to make a living.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>International Divide and Conquer vs. Total Liquidation</h3>
<p>After Germany, Italy, and Japan signed their alliance, this newspaper analyzed the essence of the alliance and its relationship with the Far East in the previous two days. Today, we will further examine the international future after the three countries formed the alliance.</p>
<p>The signing of the Tripartite Pact took place on September 27th. In these four days, the three countries have not taken any new actions based on the alliance, and other countries have not shown any concrete reactions to the alliance. However, several points related to the alliance are worth noting: (1) The US authorities have stated that their unlimited assistance to Britain will be extended to Australia and New Zealand. They insist on their original policy in the Far East, which is that all countries must fully respect the legitimate rights of Americans, respect all international treaties and agreements that the US has participated in, and maintain equal opportunities in trade. Furthermore, many members of Congress and public opinion leaders advocate for providing as much assistance as possible to China and Britain against Japan. The change in the Navy's planned phased return to the Pacific coast, namely moving the base from Hawaii to the Philippines, has not been denied by the US authorities. (2) The British authorities publicly warned Japan to abandon its policy of compromise, stating that Britain's attitude is different now than before, and "Japan will soon discover" this. (3) The Chinese authorities have expressed their unwavering determination to continue resisting Japan and strive for final victory. (4) The Japanese authorities have admitted to widespread hunger and poverty within the country, and see the alliance as a gamble on the nation's fate. (5) The German authorities have stated that the issue of the Dutch East Indies' sphere of influence was not mentioned in the alliance. As for the Soviet Union's arms assistance to China, Germany does not believe it contradicts the Tripartite Pact and therefore will not prevent the Soviet Union from continuing its assistance. (6) The Soviet authorities and press have made no comments on the alliance, displaying an attitude of quiet observation. Since the reconciliation between Germany and the Soviet Union and the war between Britain and Germany, the Soviet Union has supported Germany in various ways for over a year. This time, their lack of comment can at least be seen as encouragement for the three countries' alliance.</p>
<p>The above six points are the most noteworthy expressions from various parties in these four days. As for the international future after the three countries formed the alliance, whether the treaty will be gradually developed in multiple directions based on these six points remains to be seen. It is not necessary to make any optimistic conclusions prematurely. It is by no means necessarily pessimistic; at least for now, the three countries have not sown new factors that will change the international situation. If the international situation is indeed pessimistic, it is not solely due to the Tripartite Pact. The roots of the Tripartite Pact run deep, even before the Anti-Comintern Pact. The establishment of the Anti-Comintern Pact also had its origins and was by no means a sudden coincidence. Starting with the Anti-Comintern Pact, the key lies in the fact that Germany, Italy, and Japan needed to exploit and collude with each other, and then establish a treaty. At that time, they expediently put an anti-communist label on the treaty. Before August of last year, the anti-communist facade was embellished with various postures, both real and fake. Some countries joined the treaty later, and some implicitly sympathized with it. It was all about anti-communism and anti-Soviet Union. In reality, it was only the mutual exploitation and collusion of the three countries. It had nothing to do with the participants or sympathizers, nor did it have anything to do with the communism or the Soviet Union that they were opposing. Then, in August of last year, the Soviet Union and Germany suddenly announced their reconciliation, seemingly contradicting the Anti-Comintern Pact. The Soviet Union seemed to have gained something, while Britain and France seemed to have lost something. In reality, the existence or abolition of the Anti-Comintern Pact was never the issue; the proximity or estrangement from communism or the Soviet Union was merely expedient. The key was still the mutual exploitation and collusion of the three countries. Adapting to the environment based on this key, they eventually merged into this alliance. Therefore, the entire international community's interests, fortunes, and misfortunes have long been affected by the mutual exploitation and collusion of the three countries, and the Tripartite Pact has neither increased nor decreased this influence.</p>
<p>Analyzing the current predicament of the entire international community from this perspective, will it be resolved separately through divide and conquer, or will it promote cooperation and total liquidation? This is what every country is hesitating about in the midst of the turmoil. The three countries are like this, and so are all countries outside the three. Although the Tripartite Pact has no new content, it has brought other countries, and indeed the entire international community, closer to a crossroads, urging them to quickly choose a path. In general, the nature of an alliance is to cooperate, but the intention of the three countries is to divide and conquer the entire international community and resolve issues separately. This is their fundamental principle. Not only that, but this principle will be used by the three countries to deal with all other countries, and will eventually be applied to the three countries themselves. The purpose of this alliance is not active cooperation, but only to passively prevent other countries from cooperating, in order to cover up their aggression through divide and conquer. In the past, they prevented other countries from cooperating, and thus succeeded in Abyssinia in Africa, Czechoslovakia and Poland in Europe, and so on. Now, they are targeting China and Britain, hoping to achieve divide and conquer, but they fear cooperation from other countries, so they have formed an alliance. If the alliance proves effective in the future and they succeed in their goals, they will naturally each choose their next target. Because when they can no longer prevent other countries from cooperating, the alliance's expiration date will arrive, and they will engage in a global struggle, accepting a total liquidation. This is something that the three countries cannot avoid, but it is definitely not their intention in forming the alliance at present.</p>
<p>As for the countries outside the three, such as China and Britain, who do not want to be defeated and are unwilling to be resolved, they naturally welcome more assistance and are happy to cooperate with other countries. But they have already started resisting Japan and are determined to fight to the end independently, so they have no dilemma. Other countries, such as the United States, should not be blind to the overall situation and hope to escape being targeted in the future. If they are facing a dilemma, will they assist China and Britain and wait for them to restrain the other party on their own, or will they directly step forward? Both of these paths fall within the scope of cooperation, but differ in degree. Within this same scope, will they take effective action in the near future, or will they wait for their large-scale military expansion plan to be completed? These two paths differ in timing. The Soviet Union must also not be blind to the overall situation and hope to escape being targeted, but they have an additional layer of awareness compared to the United States: how will the boundaries of nation and the realm of ideology be combined? Can they be truly understood? This is a dilemma. If they cannot obtain absolutely reliable guarantees that ideology can penetrate the nation, they will gladly cooperate to curb aggression and will never sit idly by and wait for being divided and conquered.

<p>Washington - Washington's diplomatic experts predict a prolonged and intense economic war will occur between the United States and Japan, but a military conflict is not immediately likely. For the sake of both countries' interests, avoiding war for as long as possible is best. This is the opinion of foreign diplomats and military observers generally. The reporter saw this in today's interviews in various newspapers. Experts said a war in the Pacific would shift America's important war industry strength to the Far East, but this strength is needed now to assist Britain against Germany. Authorities told reporters the US government considers the Sino-Japanese war a subsidiary, the ultimate reality being the outcome of the European war. If Britain loses, the US must abandon its interests in the Far East Pacific. Whether Japan should preserve its spoils of war will follow Hitler's orders. Hitler may let Japan keep its spoils to contain the Soviet Union. However, he may reaffirm his "Aryan superiority" and force Japan to disgorge what it has gained. Officials here pointed out Hitler has not treated Japan well in the past. When the Soviet Union threatened Japan, Hitler signed an agreement with the Soviet Union. But soon Hitler lured Japan to join the Anti-Comintern Pact. (International News Agency dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt said last night that the result of Germany, Italy and Japan signing an alliance will cause the United States to immediately intensify its military preparedness to cope with the threats on both the eastern and western fronts. The President also wrote to Secretary of War Stimson and Secretary of the Navy Knox, expressing confidence that America's industries will continue to cooperate with the administration's defense programs indefinitely, and expressing his hope that the industrial sector would automatically supply defense materials on an unlimited basis. He also said that when the Army and Navy feel the need to establish commission contracts, they should first submit them to the National Defense Commission for review.

<p>Tokyo - Mr. Yamamoto, editor of the "Improvement Magazine", recently returned from a world tour and said that German and Italian people believe that war between Japan and the United States is inevitable. Mr. Yamamoto wrote in the latest issue of the magazine: "The military strength of both countries has been studied by Germany and Italy using the false image of a Japanese-American war. Judging from the current state of military equipment, German and Italian people believe that if a war occurs in the Pacific, Japan will win, because Japanese naval officers and soldiers are better trained than those in the United States. German and Italian people said that if the war takes place near the Philippines or the China Sea, the US fleet has no chance of victory. I was very interested to hear the same view in Moscow." Mr. Yamamoto continued, "I am not a naval expert and cannot publish statistics on warships, but in terms of technical personnel, I believe that Japan can gain the upper hand over the United States in a war. Some Japanese people estimate that the United States' strength is above Japan's, which I find incomprehensible." Mr. Yamamoto said that the United States does not intend to fight Japan, and if it were not for the troubles from Washington, they would invest in "Manchuria." Mr. Yamamoto hinted that Japan also does not want to go to war with the United States. He said, "Japan has no territorial ambitions in the Dutch East Indies and French Vietnam. Japan needs the trade of the Dutch East Indies because the United States is unwilling to sell gasoline to Japan." Yamamoto criticized China for not cooperating with Japan to "liberate the nations of East Asia from Western oppression." He said, "China still dreams that it can rely on European powers, the United States and the Soviet Union to resist Japan. If so, Japan will have to fight alone. I do not mean that Japan should make enemies of the world. I am advocating for increasing friendly ties with Germany and Italy, and we still have some issues to reach an understanding with the Soviet Union." Although Mr. Yamamoto advocates for close ties with Germany and Italy, he said that Japan "should be wary of Germany's global plans and ambitions." He said that once Germany establishes hegemony in Europe, it will seek markets in South America and will compete with Japan in some parts of the Far East. Japan should also carefully consider Germany's territorial intentions in the Far East. Yamamoto said that no matter what changes occur in Europe, Japan should maintain its leadership position in the Far East. "In terms of Asia, Japan will not be subject to pressure from any side."

<p>Tokyo - A Tokyo newspaper said today that Japan has reorganized its industrial and economic structures to cope with possible economic retaliation from Britain and the United States. The newspaper said that the National Design Committee has reconfigured Japan's economic needs to cope with the American embargo on scrap iron and steel. The newspaper also said that the United States refused to buy Japanese silk, and Japan will retaliate by refusing to buy American cotton. (International News Agency dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Closely Monitors Developments in the Far East: Germany, Italy, and Japan Military Alliance Concluded, Will Prompt US, Soviet Union, and Britain to Cooperate</h3>
<p>Moscow - Soviet newspapers yesterday remained silent on the matter of the military alliance formed by Germany, Italy, and Japan. However, Moscow newspapers all prominently published the statement issued by US Secretary of State Hull regarding the agreement. Soviet newspapers also reprinted opinions from American newspapers, believing that the new Rome-Berlin-Tokyo axis will lead the United States to cooperate more closely with Britain and promote Britain's ultimate victory. Yesterday, the Pravda published a lengthy analytical special article examining the economic recovery of the United States due to its expansion of military preparedness and increased US exports to Britain. (TASS dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Moscow - Soviet newspapers mostly published in prominent positions US Secretary of State Hull's revelation of the existence of a long-standing relationship revealed by the alliance agreement among Germany, Italy, and Japan. They also revealed a long dispatch from the TASS news agency in New York regarding the increasing output of the US arms industry. Trud reprinted a study from Izvestia that the US Navy in the Pacific is superior to the Japanese Navy. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Moscow - Political circles here are paying close attention to the developments in the Far East. The issues of Southeast Asia have overshadowed other issues, which is quite satisfying. Izvestia reported that TASS's New York report said that US economic circles are expected to continue to expand the disputes in the Far East and that the possibility of US involvement in the war has greatly increased. Another report from New York discussed the increase in cooperation between Britain and the United States, paying particular attention to the recent negotiations between the British ambassador and the US State Department regarding the United States increasing its arms aid to Britain.

<p>European and Asian Wars Will Further Expand</p>
<p>Moscow - Pravda today published a commentary titled "The Tripartite Alliance in Berlin," stating, "The military alliance among Germany, Italy, and Japan has been signed in Berlin. From the Soviet Union's perspective, this agreement is not unexpected, because the relationship among the three countries has existed in practice for a long time. At the same time, before the agreement was announced, the German government had notified the Soviet government in advance." Regarding the significance of this agreement, we should first note that the agreement foreshadows a new stage of the war. In this new stage, the intensity of the war will be even greater than before the agreement was signed. The European and Asian wars were originally divided into the European, African, and Chinese theaters, but now that Japan has abandoned its policy of non-intervention in European affairs, the two theaters have merged into one. This shows that the war will further expand. In the last session of the Supreme Soviet, Molotov said, "There is currently a crisis of war expanding and forming a world imperialist war." These words are true. So, what are the motives and reasons for the signing of this agreement? Undoubtedly, the main motivation for the conclusion of the agreement is the expansion of British and American military cooperation. For example, the United States has recently stepped up its military assistance to Britain, Britain has transferred its naval base in the Western Hemisphere to the United States, British-Canadian military forces are uniting with the United States, South American countries are joining the US sphere of influence, and Britain has agreed to transfer its bases in the Far East and Australia to the United States. Undoubtedly, the United States has not yet joined the fighting to aid Britain, but this is not important. The fact is that Germany, Italy and Japan are an opposing military front.</p>
<p>Soviet Union's Policy of Peace Will Not Change</p>
<p>The agreement is an open recognition of the spheres of influence of each of the signatory countries and an agreement on joint defense against any infringement by other countries (primarily Britain and the United States) on their spheres of influence. According to this agreement, the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" is assigned to Japan, and the "European Sphere" belongs to Germany and Italy. As to whether the signatory countries will be able to realize the division of their spheres of influence is another question. The realization of this plan will depend on the true strength of the relationship between the belligerent countries, as well as the progress and outcome of the current war. The current war has become increasingly sharp. Another key point of the agreement is the reserved attitude towards the Soviet Union. The agreement states, "Germany, Italy and Japan declare that this agreement does not affect the existing political relations between the signatory countries and the Soviet Union." This reserved attitude should first be regarded as a reaffirmation of the signatory countries' attitude of neutrality towards the Soviet Union (since the first day of the outbreak of the war, the Soviet Union has maintained this attitude of neutrality). Secondly, this agreement confirms the strength and importance of the non-aggression pacts between the Soviet Union and Germany and between the Soviet Union and Italy. The Soviet Union is determined to pursue its neutral and peaceful policy. We hereby solemnly confirm that this neutral and peaceful policy will continue to remain unchanged in the future.

<h3>Tokyo Foreign Ministry Announces Withdrawal of Japanese Nationals from Britain: Spokesman Talks About the Characteristics of the Tripartite Pact, Technical Committee Members to be Appointed Soon</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Today, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs officially announced that the Japanese Embassy in London has ordered 750 Japanese nationals in Britain to evacuate as soon as possible. It is said that this measure is not related to the possible deterioration of British-Japanese relations after the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact among Germany, Italy, and Japan. The difficulties encountered by Japanese nationals are increasing, especially in the London area. As a result of German air raids, the business of Japanese-owned hotels, apartments, and shops has been suspended. Only the Yokohama Specie Bank, Mitsui &amp; Co., and a few other commercial firms continue to operate. The Japanese Embassy has instructed Nippon Yusen Kaisha to send the Hi-Mishima Maru, currently in Lisbon, to London to evacuate the first batch of 150 to 200 Japanese nationals. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma told reporters today that although Japan has concluded the Tripartite Pact, it still maintains neutrality in the European war. This pact is not an alliance, nor is it merely a mutual assistance agreement. Its scope exceeds a military alliance. The salient feature is that the first and second clauses stipulate that the signatory countries jointly strive for the establishment of a new order in East Asia and Europe. This agreement is constructive and defensive in nature, and its various characteristics should not be underestimated. The three signatory countries are now working together to establish a new order in order to save the world from turmoil and the horrors of war. Japan has no intention of invoking the Tripartite Pact to challenge or attack any other country. The English translation of the outline of the agreement includes all the important points of the original text and does not omit anything. The spokesman also declared in response to a question on whether this agreement will complicate Japan's relationship with other countries that the agreement simplifies the relationship between Britain and Japan, because Britain now has only one path to follow for Japan, which is to recognize the new order in this part of the world, and any country that opposes the new order will be deemed to refuse to cooperate with Japan. At this point, the spokesman reiterated that Japan has never given up hope of adjusting its relations with Britain and the United States. Asked whether the Tripartite Pact will delay Japan's appointment of a diplomatic representative to Australia, he replied that the two matters are not related. The spokesman indicated that Japan's newly appointed ambassador to Canada, Yoshizawa, has now departed to take office, and the government will appoint an ambassador to Australia in the near future. A reporter asked whether the joint technical committee stipulated in the Tripartite Pact has been appointed. The spokesman replied that the members of the joint committee will be appointed soon. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - Tokyo News, A Foreign Ministry spokesman said, regarding how the "attack" situation in Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact among Germany, Italy, and Japan is constituted, should be jointly explained by the three signatory countries. The term "attack" does not need to refer specifically to an actual war or a declaration of war. (Dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3>Tungsten Ore Industry Transported to US via Vietnam</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Since the US Export-Import Bank lent China a new loan of US$25 million to meet China's foreign exchange needs, tungsten ore has taken on a new and important position. According to reports, China recently exported 6,000 tons of tungsten ore from Haiphong, divided into two ships and transported to the United States, and has reportedly reached its destination. China exported a total of 7,300 tons of tungsten ore in the first seven months of this year. The China Resources Commission is now working to solve transportation difficulties. It is estimated that China's total annual output of tungsten ore is 16,000 tons, including 8,000 tons from Jiangxi Province, 4,000 tons from Guangdong Province, 2,500 tons from Guangxi Province, 1,200 tons from Henan Province, and 1,000 tons from Yunnan Province.

<h3>Japanese Newspapers Launch Major Intimidation, Threatening Dutch East Indies, Advocate Withdrawing Envoys and Ceasing Negotiations, Forcing Them to Break Away from the US and Cooperate with Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese newspapers today unanimously appealed that unless the Dutch East Indies government can guarantee that all anti-Japanese elements have been completely eliminated, Japan should immediately disrupt the ongoing negotiations. The Hochi Shimbun stated that after Japan and Germany and Italy signed the strong military alliance of the three, the situation in the Pacific has greatly changed. It believes that Japan should immediately recall its special envoy to the Dutch East Indies and order him to quickly return to Tokyo. The newspaper stated, "Negotiating with the East Indies government now is tantamount to 'putting the cart before the horse'. Moreover, the prerequisite for conducting negotiations must be to eliminate all anti-Japanese attitudes before it can be done." Dutch officials should express their willingness to cooperate with Japan to build a "Greater East Asia" before there is room for peaceful negotiations. Because the East Indies has always relied on the United States in military and economic aspects, if the East Indies does not break away from its dependence on the United States, then Japan's continued negotiations with it will be fundamentally useless. At the same time, the Kokumin Shimbun stated that Japan's older politicians are advising Prime Minister Konoe to convene an extraordinary Diet to show Japan's 100% unified support after the alliance of the three powers. The newspaper also stated that the government will soon launch a large-scale campaign to complete Japan's national defense. (Associated Press dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3>US Foreign Policy Association Asks For Expanding Aid to China, Because China Is the First Line of Defense in Asia for Western Countries</h3>
<p>Washington - The Foreign Policy Association today issued an article discussing Japan's advance into Southeast Asia, and stated that China is actually the first line of defense in Asia for Western countries. The Association's interviewer, expert Bisson, studied the pressure that Japan is exerting on European countries, and stated that its gains are actually being given by Britain and France. As a result of the most recent developments, the United States has become the primary enemy. From now on, it is not impossible to find effective methods to suppress Japan. Bisson stated in brief, "China's four years of resistance war, the current standing is more obvious, foreign aid can be greatly expanded". It is also said, "If the countries do not supply China with heavy weapons and large quantities of arms again, the country's resistance war strength will be reduced. Japan has not made major progress in China last year, and it has gained quite a lot from European countries." Bisson concluded that Japan can clearly pay attention to and sense world developments.

<h3>Nazi Party's Overseas Activities Cost 200 Million US Dollars Annually: US Navy Zhang Publishes Report</h3>
<p>Washington - US Navy Captain Theodore Dra and well-known reporter Morey recently collaborated on an article that describes in detail the organization and activities of the Nazi Party abroad. The article is over two thousand words long and has now been disclosed by US Navy Secretary Knox, and is listed as one of the Nazi activity investigation reports. The words say: Hitler's great military achievements are certainly the effect of using Germans and the "Fifth Column" to engage in work in the victimized countries, but we then have the following question: how did this great achievement become possible? How did the Germans abroad sacrifice themselves for the Nazi government? How did foreigners living under more moderate and civilized governments voluntarily betray their home countries and pledge allegiance to Hitler's Germany? In our view, it is extremely mysterious. It must be known that the Nazi Party spends US$200 million annually on overseas organizations and propaganda, which is the answer to this question. The amount of this summary is huge, which is a secret. Nazi Germany is not a government, and is not even like what Nazi orators call a "national state," but is actually a secret, conspiratorial gang. Its scope of action is universal, and its goal is to dominate the world. Its important overseas envoys, like the millions of Germans within Germany and residing abroad, can be used or forced to serve Germany. The first step in its activities is to make foreign German expatriates follow its doctrine. The second step is to deal with its real enemies or those it deems to be enemies through assassination and kidnapping. The last step is to use armed unrest to deal with foreign countries that Hitler wants to conquer or annex. This kind of German unrest has already been applied to Czechoslovakia, Austria and the Netherlands. If it were not for the firm attitude of the United States, many researchers believe that this kind of unrest would have already occurred in Brazil. (Associated Press dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3>Stirling's Loud Appeal: Japan is America's Enemy; America Should Strive to Defend Itself and Aid Britain</h3>
<p>New York – U.S. Admiral Stirling recently issued a statement saying that Japan is America's enemy. He stated, "Japan's alliance with the Axis powers clearly shows that it is an enemy of the United States. Japan is constantly afraid that the United States might change its verbal protests into actual actions, or even resort to war for a fundamental solution. Japan should at least know that the U.S. fleet can launch fierce warfare from the large naval base using Singapore and by taking an offensive from British territories or the Philippines on Japan's main sea lanes, to undermine Japan's economic security in the East and defeat Japan's troops in China. If Japan continues its hostile aims in the Far East and expands its aggression southward, its obvious action would be to seek a military alliance to resist the United States. Now that Japan has allied with Germany and Italy, the United States should consider this alliance as a warning and threat to our country's sovereignty in the Philippines. Japan has, through this alliance, informed our country that it will not hesitate to realize its ambition to build a new order in Asia. We must now recognize that Japan is prepared to control the entire Vietnam, British Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies. If the United States interferes, Japan will receive assistance from Germany and Italy. Our current policy should be to carefully await a policy of fighting in the Pacific. We must defend Hawaii and the Pacific coast. An almighty nation should recognize that America's policy is for self-defense, to continue to maintain the American way of life, and to save Britain from failure, which is also America's main goal."

<h3>British Navy Vigilant Against Germany: Hitler's Invasion Crisis Still Exists in Autumn and Winter</h3>
<p>British Naval Port – A Reuters naval correspondent reports that the Navy warns the people not to have the illusion that the coming of autumn and winter will eliminate the invasion crisis, that coastal climate has a great impact on Hitler's England plan. It is about to turn from sunny to cloudy. The general public may inevitably believe that the opportunity to invade England has passed with the arrival of autumn and winter, thinking that the flat-bottomed boats needed to transport troops across the sea cannot be used in the future stormy waves. It must be known that climate change is not constant, and there may occasionally be calm seas in autumn and winter, allowing flat-bottomed boats to safely cross the sea. Moreover, in the next few weeks, the tranquil time at sea, the so-called second summer, may come. If the Germans hope to wait for an opportunity and attack the unprepared English, they will definitely be greatly disappointed. The Blue British Navy is always vigilant. Preparations at the French Channel ports are still underway. This can be seen as further evidence that the invasion of England is still possible, because the German side's continued preparations on the French coast are not only intended to contain the British bomber squadrons, making them unable to concentrate on attacking more important military targets.

<h3>Intensified Struggle Between British and German Air Forces: Air Raid Scope Increasingly Expands; British Aircraft Groups Bomb Western German Cities; Edinburgh and Other Places Suffer from German Night Raids</h3>
<p>London – Britain and Germany have now increased the speed of their mutual air raids and expanded their bombing ranges. This can be seen from the German aircraft's bombing of many cities in the British interior and the British aircraft's retaliatory attacks on the German bases for invading England and various industrial areas in Germany. Yesterday, German aircraft adopted evasive and sudden advance tactics over London, attempting to break through the London air defense circle separately all day without success. When night fell, German aircraft changed to using group charge tactics and finally broke into the airspace above this British capital. London then entered its twenty-third night under aerial siege amidst the incessant roar of anti-aircraft guns. Several German aircraft resolutely attempted to break in but were repelled. However, they finally crossed the London air defense line and bombed heavily, causing many deaths. German aircraft also flew northwest and east of London to bomb and made their first attack on Dover in several days. A large gas plant in London was destroyed by bombs falling like hail. Residents in several areas of the city had no gas for cooking and lighting. A hospital in the central area was also heavily damaged. During the German air raid on Dover, several bombs happened to hit a garden where the first German bomb fell during the Great European War. (30th International News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>London – The British aircraft that raided Berlin were hampered by bad weather, completing the 600-mile flight to the German capital at the scheduled midnight hour. They located the Frederickville power station and the main power transformer station in the western district and dropped high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs. The British aircraft also succeeded in bombing the railway junction 65 miles west of Berlin. Other British aircraft concentrated on bombing railway traffic, hitting the railway junction of Hamburg and the main station of Hanover. The woods next to the railway line near Bremen were also set on fire. Continuous explosions occurred in the target area of Wroclaw for ten minutes. Hanover was attacked by British aircraft for two hours. In addition to damage to the docks, merchant ships in the port were likely hit by two bombs. A pilot described the bombing of the Hanover arsenal, saying, "When we arrived at Hanover, one of the two rectangular buildings of the arsenal was already on fire, so we repeatedly swooped down to bomb the other building. The building and the surrounding houses also caught fire, and thick smoke rose to a thousand feet." (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>London Under Air Raid: Major Fires in Many Places</p>
<p>London – German aircraft fiercely attacked London this morning, as well as various counties of the headquarters and Mousehill. Many areas of London were hit by bombs and caused several fires. Houses in many residential areas were destroyed, and there were many casualties among residents. According to the Ministry of Aviation, several large fires were caused in the Mousehill area, and several stores were damaged, with some casualties. Although the area bombed in the various counties of the headquarters was wide, the damage was not heavy, and there were few casualties. The damage and casualties in other areas were minor. One German bomber that raided London last night was hit and destroyed by anti-aircraft guns. British fighter aircraft also shot down one German bomber and one fighter, so the German side lost a total of nine bombers and one fighter yesterday. The British side lost four fighters, but the pilots of two of them escaped safely. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London – As of 2:00 PM today, a total of three alarms have been issued in London. In the first instance, a squadron of eighty enemy aircraft flew over the coast of Kent and then split into several small teams flying inland. In the second instance, forty enemy aircraft split into several teams flying over the southeast coast but were repelled by British fighter aircraft before penetrating inland. In both of the above instances, German aircraft did not reach the London area. In the third instance, British fighter aircraft and enemy aircraft were engaged in combat at high altitude in the western suburbs of London. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>London – Last night, two enemy aircraft intruded into the airspace above central London. The fire of London's defenses was unleashed to the sky, and hundreds of shells swept across the sky. The sound of artillery lasted for ten minutes before stopping. According to a communique from the Ministry of Aviation and Internal Security, at least three German bombers were destroyed before dawn on Sunday. One touched a network of barrage balloons and fell into the sea off the south coast, one was shot down by a British fighter in the Thames River basin, and one was hit by land artillery fire and fell into the sea off the southeast coast. Enemy activity this morning was limited to single aircraft attacking several times. Bombs fell on several places in the Thames estuary and four villages and towns on the south coast. Material damage was very minor, and casualties among residents were also very few. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London – When German aircraft attacked London day and night until early Monday morning, they encountered unprecedentedly fierce fire from ground artillery. Two German aircraft were simultaneously hit by at least one hundred shells and were immediately shattered in mid-air. Most German aircraft could not break through the London air defense circle and dropped bombs in the suburbs, causing quite a lot of damage (30th International News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>British Long-Range Guns Bombard French Coast</p>
<p>London – Before dawn today, British long-range guns bombarded the French coast. It is believed that the docks of Calais were directly hit, and a large fire was still burning after the shelling stopped. The usual cannon fire retaliated. Later, German long-range guns began to bombard the Dover area again. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London – According to official announcements, British bombers again attacked ports on the French and Belgian coasts, gun positions near Cape Gris-Nez, and military assembly areas, oil depots, and aluminum plants in Germany last night. It is said that the reports of the pilots have not yet been completely checked. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London – An Air Ministry communique stated that British Air Force bombers flew to Germany and the English Channel ports in the occupied area to carry out bombing on Saturday night. The weather in northern Germany was unfavorable, but the British aircraft attacking still reached their destination. The British aircraft attacking Berlin bombed power stations and anti-aircraft gun positions in the surrounding areas, and important railway centers and airfields in northern Germany were also among the targets attacked. Fires and explosions broke out after the naval base of Wilhelmshaven was heavily bombed. The arsenal in Hanau, near Frankfurt, was attacked and suffered heavy damage. The ports of Le Havre, Fécamp, Boulogne, Calais, Dunkirk, and a row of artillery positions near Cape Gris-Nez along the Channel coast, and the Lorient base, were all heavily bombed. Two British aircraft were missing. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>European War Musings (10) (5) Germany's New Military Science</h3>
<p>The original author of this article, Hoffman Nickerson, is an American military strategist who served in the US Army General Staff during the last World War. He has written many books on military science. The original article appeared in the August issue of Harpers' Magazine. It is translated as follows:</p>
<p>The new tactics and strategies of Germany, which have astonished the world, are not really mysterious. On the contrary, their general principles are familiar to all educated military personnel and those who pay attention to warfare. As for the deployment and application of paratrooper units and new weapons rumored but not yet confirmed, details still await future exploration. Generally speaking, however, Germany's recent military operations in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands completely followed the pattern of the Polish and Norwegian campaigns. In these campaigns, the German army did not try to produce any miracles but instead completed their achievements with two special characteristics: rapid use of troops and flexible coordination.</p>
<p>The progress of new military technology is an inevitable result of the experience of the last World War. Since November 1918, such military theories have been studied and discussed in various aspects.</p>
<p>Most of the decisive battles between 1914 and 1918 can serve as a marker of what should be improved and what should be avoided in future wars. The last war was won through attrition. After the deaths of over ten million soldiers and even more civilians, the bankruptcy of various industries, and the collapse of the vast society of the Russian Empire, Germany finally disintegrated. The price of this strategy was very high, and the outcome was equally miserable for the victors and the vanquished, making it a truly unprofitable undertaking. Before the Western Front became stalemated and trench warfare developed in 1914, the German army had an opportunity to win in the Battle of the Marne. Four years later, in the spring of 1918, the German counter-offensive tactics again gave them a chance to win. Unfortunately, the German army did not seize these two opportunities firmly. In between, the heavily armed infantry and artillery of both sides were merely engaged in ineffective mutual bombardment, and everything else was powerless.</p>
<p>Military scholars from various countries, like ordinary people, have all drawn the same conclusion from this kind of situation, believing that such a phenomenon should not happen again in the future. General von Seeckt, a great figure in the German military and the founder of the new German army, summarized the lessons learned from the last World War in his book "Thoughts of a Soldier" as follows:</p>
<p>"What kind of results did such a national conscription produce? Even though all efforts were exhausted, the war did not end because the enemy army was finally annihilated on the battlefield; instead, this kind of war largely turned into a war of attrition for the possession of fortified positions, until one of the belligerent countries had its resources for resistance, replenishment of manpower, supply of raw materials, and morale for combat completely exhausted under the superior strength of the other side. But did the victorious countries enjoy their victory? Did the results of the war, with such a waste of national strength, make it worthwhile? … Military personnel cannot help but ask themselves whether they can come up with other strategies for decisive victory while avoiding indecisive wars of attrition. National conscription with universal conscription may no longer be applicable. … The people of the whole country are practically inflexible in their operation and inflexible in their command. … They cannot achieve victory and can only use pure force to defeat everything."</p>
<p>From all perspectives, new tactics were germinating in the latter half of the war from 1914 to 1918. This development was due to the application of internal combustion engines to mechanized units, which gave rise to tanks and aircraft. Aircraft certainly had practical utility in trench warfare, but this utility had its limits. As for the achievements of tanks, they were truly remarkable. In the Battle of Cambrai in 1917, the Allied forces initially used them to attack and unleash the power to break through the German lines. This attack, if assisted by appropriate forces, could have ended the war.</p>
<p>Military scholars who emphasize avoiding excessive bloodshed, excessive destruction, and excessive expenditure of money are divided into two factions. One faction, a minority, advocates the "air terror theory," whose famous representative is the Italian General Douhet. They believe in the power of bombers. According to this faction, a sudden large-scale attack by bombers, first destroying the enemy's air force and then using indiscriminate methods to bomb cities and create terror among civilians, could achieve victory overnight.</p>
<p>Although this proposition has gained the belief of some people, most military scholars do not pay attention to it. This majority faction can be represented by the late professor of Harvard University, the American military historian,械　庄师敦. In his famous book "Impressions of the 1918 Campaign," he said: "We have heard a lot from laymen and half-baked military scholars about theories that future wars can be decided with special weapons, such as bombers. The results obtained in the 1918 campaigns were the opposite... Never in the history of warfare has the coordination of various weapons been so important, and never has it been so difficult." In other words, thoughtful military and naval officers in various countries all understand that the more powerful aircraft become, the more important their cooperation with other military departments becomes, and the so-called other important military departments are the army and the navy.</p>
<p>As for the situation in Germany, on the one hand, it was deeply resentful of the humiliation of the Treaty of Versailles. On the other hand, it was due to the benefits of that treaty that German military scholars were able to adjust various novel weapons created by modern industry.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish this arduous task, General von Seeckt formulated an operational plan for future land warfare, the content of which is divided into three actions. According to his theory, the current air force, since it is staffed by specialists serving for life, should be able to be dispatched at any time. Therefore, the air force should be the first force to act, and its task is first to destroy the enemy's air force, disperse the enemy's large army concentrations, hinder the enemy's mobilization of manpower and resources, and決者擊the enemy's cities, factories, and supply centers.</p>
<p>The second step stipulates that after the air force launches an attack, it should be followed as soon as possible by a full-scale attack by the regular army. The higher the efficiency of the army, the faster the mobilization, and the more flexible the command, the greater the chance of defeating the enemy, so that they can immediately sue for peace. The third step states that when the regular armies of the two belligerent parties are engaged on the front lines to seek a preliminary victory, the rear must quickly form a defensive force. After the front-line troops have achieved a preliminary victory, they can increase their attacking power through the supply of this kind of reserve army and supplies, while also preventing the enemy from reinforcing them in time.</p>
<p>In summary, General von Seeckt believes that future wars will be won by utilizing highly mobile troops. Such troops emphasize quality over quantity and are even more effective with the assistance of aircraft. According to him, once this kind of mobile combat unit is dispatched, it should preferably not be reinforced again, or if reinforcements are needed, the number should be very small.</p>
<p>General von Seeckt, the Builder of the New German Army</p>
<p>In this way, we can think of the situation in the Polish campaign last year. The new weapons mentioned in the three-part drama of General von Seeckt's combat are only the aircraft. Perhaps various new weapons were prohibited from being used by Germany at that time, or perhaps the smooth Prussian military deliberately avoided the word "tank." This point can be deduced from his writings. He said that although trench warfare is sufficient to gradually disintegrate a country with weaker material resources, the military objective is to achieve a final victory of annihilation. Therefore, future victory should be sought in mobile warfare. In this sense, that kind of army "cavalry" that excels in mobility should not be abandoned. What he calls "cavalry" actually refers to aircraft, motorcycles, armored vehicles, and tanks.</p>
<p>From the above, we can see how General von Seeckt emphasizes offensive warfare, which can truly represent the current German military ideal. Although the Germans also believe in the great power of modern defensive warfare, they know that only offensive warfare can achieve real results. The German authorities know that this is a difficult problem to solve, but they are still doing their best to solve it, which is the secret of the German army's success.</p>
<p>In war, as in other human activities, all ideas must be put into practice by people. With time, good officers can train good soldiers, but the time factor is very important. Today's German army has officers and soldiers who have received rigorous training. This is because of the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles. The number of German troops is small, and the result is naturally an emphasis on quality over quantity.</p>
<p>When the National Socialist government restored conscription and intensified the training of new soldiers, it was naturally more important than everything else. Military experts from various countries at the time were skeptical of how General von Seeckt's 100,000 elite soldiers could become the foundation of a million-strong army without impairing their combat capabilities. Such a sudden expansion and extremely large organization, with thousands of threads, would naturally be very difficult to complete the task.</p>
<p>The essence of the new tactics is not only limited to the use of new weapons but also requires elite soldiers to apply these new weapons. The astonishing speed of the German army's operations is entirely due to this.</p>
<p>The reason why the training of new German soldiers can save time is that the National Socialist Labor Service Corps has already provided preliminary training. Those new soldiers are already physically strong and well-trained. Once they enter the army, they can spend all their time training in the use of weapons. Air force personnel receive preliminary training through civil aviation.</p>
<p>The entire organization of the army and air force is entirely aimed at achieving maximum mobility and the most courageous attacks. Of the problems studied by the German Staff College, nine belong to the offensive and only one belongs to the defensive. In order to enable the artillery to quickly assist the infantry, the so-called "combat teams" responsible for mobile warfare are organized so that a regiment of infantry must have a battalion of field light artillery always following them.</p>
<p>In peacetime, in addition to the forty-two infantry divisions, there must be nine mechanized armored divisions. Each armored division has 14,000 officers and soldiers and 3,000 motorcycles. Each division is divided into three groups: (1) reconnaissance group, with 50 armored vehicles and a company of motorcycle infantry; (2) attack group, with 450 tanks; (3) position occupation group, with a motorized infantry brigade and a field artillery regiment. Armored divisions require more technicians, more mechanical repair personnel, signal personnel, and engineers who can quickly repair roads and bridges, as well as highly skilled combatants.</p>
<p>This kind of German armored force is like the armored cavalry of a hundred years ago. These armored divisions do not easily attack the enemy's positions with sufficient artillery because, at least before May of this year, no German tank could withstand artillery fire. Instead, they are used to break through the weakest point in the enemy's lines or to encircle both flanks, and then, in the enemy's rear, disrupt their lines and attack their headquarters. Therefore, their important role lies in disrupting the enemy's morale. The operational experience from 1914 to 1918 has made the German army realize that this kind of tactic is easier to carry out and more effective than artillery bombardment.</p>
<p>But the German army will never neglect the importance of infantry and artillery. Their tactics are to make the new and old weapons each get their place, and whether to focus on using new weapons or old weapons depends on the current situation.</p>
<p>In addition to technical preparations, Germany also conducts political preparations. In fact, war is nothing more than a political action because all wars are hostile actions of two large organized forces of people, and each group of people wants to force a policy on another group of people. Even a completely defensive policy is the same.</p>
<p>Germany's policy has always been aggressive. Whenever a country is attacked by Germany, Germany always uses people who sympathize with Germany to launch an internal attack and systematically disintegrate that country. At the same time, while studying how to attack the enemy with actual warfare, Germany also makes political attacks with sudden means, that is, fighting without declaring war.</p>
<p>Now it is time to talk about the experimental situation of Germany's new military science. After occupying Austria and Czechoslovakia without firing a shot or losing a soldier, Germany's first target was Poland.</p>

<h3>After the Alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan, Shanghai Circles Strengthen Their Belief That British-American Cooperation Is Beneficial to China; The Early Opening of the Burma Road Will Be Realized</h3>
<p>Since the signing of the alliance by Germany, Italy, and Japan, the situation in the Far East has become increasingly turbulent. According to inquiries made by the Pingming News Agency reporters to relevant aspects of the diplomatic circles and concession authorities in Shanghai, authoritative opinions from all parties believe that the alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan is beneficial and harmless to China's prospects for resisting Japan. The people of Shanghai are even more excited. However, all parties have expressed concern about the situation in Shanghai. Yesterday, various rumors spread in the Shanghai market, and the financial situation also underwent slight changes. Cash transactions were red,惨　$175, and the US exchange rate also showed a significant increase. However, the rumors in the market were all unfounded and untrustworthy.</p>
<p>American Defense Forces Send Troops to Defend</p>
<p>Starting at 9:00 a.m. yesterday, the American defense forces stationed in Shanghai sent troops to defend the American defense zone in the western district of the Public Concession. As a result, armed American soldiers were found patrolling in areas such as Jing'an Temple Road, Avenue Road, Weihaiwei Road, and Hart Road. It is reported that the reason for the sudden dispatch of American soldiers yesterday was to assist in maintaining security within their defense zone.</p>
<p>Merchant Corps American Team Took Over Defense Last Night</p>
<p>In addition, the northern part of the central district of the Public Concession, that is, the western district of Hongkou, has been temporarily defended by the British teams of the International Merchant Corps, such as A-Yu Battalion, Light Cavalry Team, and Armored Vehicle Team, since the 4th of last month. However, at 6:00 p.m. yesterday, the American team of the Merchant Corps, that is, B Team, replaced the British teams and took over the defense of the district. This American team will defend the district from last night until the evening of the 4th. After that, the American and British Merchant Corps will take turns taking over in proportion to the number of people.</p>
<p>Hope for the Burma Road to Open Soon</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the closure of the Burma Road, it will expire on the 18th of this month. Foreigners in Shanghai are eagerly hoping to restore traffic on the road to promote commerce. Yesterday, according to well-informed sources from British merchants, the British government, in order to retaliate against the alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan, and to meet the needs of American freight, and to promote closer cooperation between the two countries, may open the road earlier. Currently, due to the chaotic situation in Vietnam and the obstruction of traffic, the transportation value of the Burma Road has increased even more. Now that Britain has no obligation to abide by the條的due to the alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan, implementing the opening earlier is the current key task for the British government to benefit both people and itself.</p>
<p>British-American Cooperation Is Beneficial to China</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Mainland News commented on the alliance of the three countries and the change in the attitude of Britain and the United States, mainly stating that Britain and the United States can no longer tolerate the current state of affairs and must take a firm and resolute path. In view of the recent statement by the British government spokesman that Japan will fight alongside Germany and Italy, the British government has probably decided to abandon its appeasement policy. Britain has become stronger after a year of war and will no longer compromise with Japan. Britain is very different from what it was a year ago. As for the United States, because the alliance of the three countries is entirely based on anti-Americanism, it has retaliated by granting China new loans and has reached mutual understanding with Britain on Far East policies and will take concerted action. Judging from the recent sharp comments of British officials, Britain will reopen the Burma Road, and the United States can also transport China's exported tungsten ore through this road. Britain is ready to cooperate with the United States to oppose Japan. To what extent Britain's new policy will affect the Far East cannot be estimated at present, but the reaction from Chongqing is already very obvious. The Chinese government has received the material and spiritual support of Britain and the United States. Judging from the closure of the Burma Road and Japan's invasion of Vietnam, Britain and the United States' attitude toward China is very ambiguous, but the conclusion of the three-nation恊定 has made their attitude stronger. In short, democratic countries will unite because of this and oppose appeasement. The voices of people in the United States who advocate war with Japan to seek national security are quite high. China and Britain are fighting for survival today, and the United States should provide as much material assistance as possible. Although the United States' geographical environment makes it far from actual conflict, it is impossible to avoid being involved in this漩渦, it is only a matter of time.</p>
<h3>Garbage Truck and Night Soil Cart Coolies All Resumed Work; Rice Subsidy Slightly Increased</h3>
<p>The English Big Evening News reported that the coolies of the garbage trucks and night soil carts of the Public Works Department of the Public Works Bureau went on strike four days ago. By Saturday and Sunday, about 900 of them had announced their resumption of work. The remaining 600 people held a final demonstration on Sunde Road at 5:30 this morning (30th), dumping garbage and night soil on the road. However, by 6:00 a.m., these coolies had all resumed work. It is reported that the Public Works Bureau has agreed to slightly increase the rice subsidy for the coolies, and the dispute has ended.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Insults American Sailor; American Side Will Protest; Suffered Serious Injuries on Face and Body; Detailed Circumstances Are Being Closely Investigated; Admiral Hart Held an Important Meeting the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>On Saturday (28th) evening, a sailor from the flagship USS Augusta of the US Navy's Asiatic Fleet had a conflict with Japanese plainclothes military police. It is said that at that time, the Japanese military police took the American sailor to the Bank of Communications building on the Bund and then insulted him. An official of the US Navy here confirmed the occurrence of this incident yesterday morning and said that the matter is currently under investigation by the US authorities, but he refused to disclose the name of the American sailor and the circumstances of the incident. He said that the matter must be fully investigated before a serious protest is lodged with the Japanese authorities.</p>
<p>Slightly Intoxicated; Suddenly Arrested and Beaten</p>
<p>Regarding this incident between the American sailor and the Japanese military police, it is said that at the time, the sailor was walking along the Bund, slightly intoxicated. When he reached the corner of Hankou Road, he was stopped by several Japanese military police and forced into the Bank of Communications building. The message also said that the Japanese military police beat the American sailor until he suffered serious injuries on his face and body. Finally, the Public Concession Police Department received a report and tried to rescue the American sailor, but the result was ineffective.</p>
<p>Repeated Negotiations; Finally Released</p>
<p>After the US Navy Shore Patrol received the report, it worked hard to get the American sailor released, but the result was also ineffective. However, late on that Saturday night, senior officials of the Asiatic Fleet contacted the Japanese authorities, and finally the sailor was released. At that time, the sailor was obviously injured and in urgent need of treatment. It was found that the Bank of Communications building where the American sailor was detained was seized by the Japanese authorities eleven months ago. At that time, the Japanese authorities forced the expulsion of the bank's employees and took over its building.</p>
<p>Important Meeting on US Flagship</p>
<p>Admiral Hart, commander of the US Navy's Asiatic Fleet, held a meeting with US Representative Consul General Buttrick and Fourth Regiment Commander Colonel Baker on the flagship USS Augusta the day before yesterday (29th) morning. Although the details of the meeting cannot be known, it is generally believed that, in addition to the current problems related to Shanghai, these American officials also discussed the dispute between the American sailor and the Japanese military police. At the same time, it is learned that American officials also discussed the current situation in the Bund area. The Japanese plainclothes military police are now carrying out their so-called special police work there and supervising all activities along the Huangpu River, with the "tacit approval" of the Public Concession Police Department.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong's Restriction on Chinese Entry; Difficult to Achieve for the Time Being; British Ships Sailing to Vietnam; British Authorities Decided to Communicate</h3>
<p>In view of the dangerous nature of ships sailing to various ports in Vietnam, and the fact that France and Japan have signed an agreement on passage, the British Far East Naval Authorities have temporarily suspended the entry and exit of British ships to ensure the safety of navigation before the situation becomes completely clear. The Shanghai-Hubu Bay lines have also had to be temporarily suspended. However, this is only a short-term temporary measure, as this move hinders British interests in the Far East. The authorities have decided to do their best to communicate and not allow it to be delayed for a long time. Although freight transportation has been greatly affected, it is still no problem to transport food to Shanghai from places in Southeast Asia such as Siam. British and American ships sailing to various parts of Australia also stop at ports such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Yangon, Penang, and Colombo. As for the ships of the British Swire &amp; Butterfield Company, they are now rerouted to Hong Kong, awaiting further orders. According to inquiries made by reporters from the New Voice News Agency, regarding the issue of Hong Kong's restriction on Chinese entry, it is reported that the Hong Kong government has been planning this for a long time. A plan was drawn up by immigration expert Mr. Meadowsborough in Hong Kong, and important reference materials were sent to relevant parties for research. However, this restriction plan will not be realized for the time being. It may be possible to complete the formalities within the year. All Chinese people who travel to and from the Hong Kong-Shanghai area are paying attention. Once this matter is realized, the freedom of movement of Chinese people will be lost. It is reported that other nationals also have similar restrictions. The Hong Kong government's excuse is that Hong Kong's population is too dense, which has a significant impact on the economy, security, and health. Therefore, a solution is being sought.</p>
<h3>Labor Strike at French Tram Company: Negotiations Haven't Started; Yu Qiaqing Agrees to Mediate Anytime; British Tram Conditions Signed</h3>
<p>After the resolution of the labor strike at the British Shanghai Tram Company and the Chinese Public Bus Company in the International Settlement, tram and bus services have fully resumed. Yesterday morning, the British Tram Company and the workers formally signed the settlement agreement. Public bus workers sent a letter thanking Yu Qiaqing and others. The labor strike at the French Tram Company remains unresolved, and workers petitioned Yu Qiaqing yesterday, requesting him to mediate. To maintain transportation, the company has increased the number of trams on routes 2, 7, and 10. It is also making every effort to restore services on bus routes 21 and 22 and trolley routes 17, 18, and 24 in the short term.</p>
<p>British Tram Company: Formal Signing</p>
<p>The temporary settlement conditions proposed by the workers of the British Shanghai Tram Company were resolved on the 28th through the mediation of the company's compradore, Hu Ziyu. Due to insufficient time to notify the workers' representatives to sign, four representatives were appointed to go to the company and sign the agreement with acting General Manager Apelach yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to complete the procedures. The conditions consist of four items, which were previously reported. It is said that the union has sent letters thanking the mediators Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, and others, expressing their sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused to passengers due to the labor strike.</p>
<p>Public Bus Company: Letter of Thanks to Mediators</p>
<p>After the labor strike at the British Public Bus Company was resolved through mediation by Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, and Gu Bingyuan, director of the Industrial Section of the Municipal Council, the labor representatives, including Ma Gongliang, sent a letter of thanks to Yu Qiaqing and others. However, regarding the new regulations that workers would only be allowed to ride Route 50 vehicles for free starting in 1940, the workers requested Yu Qiaqing to negotiate with the company to maintain the status quo and alleviate the workers' difficulties, as all workers currently have passes and can ride all routes.</p>
<p>French Tram Company: Negotiations Pending</p>
<p>After the workers of the French Tram Company went on strike on the 25th, they put forward 16 demands for improved treatment. Although the British tram and bus disputes have been resolved, the French tram dispute remains unresolved. The strike committee sent representatives to Yu Qiaqing yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, requesting him to uphold justice and act as a mediator. It is said that Mr. Yu has accepted the workers' request and instructed them to first negotiate directly with the company.</p>
<p>Management Claims: Resolution Imminent</p>
<p>According to Mr. Fariloff, Secretary of the French Concession Tram Company, the majority of French Concession tram workers have resumed work, and four-fifths of the vehicles will resume operations today. The entire labor strike is likely to be fully resolved within the next few days. He stated that half of those forced to strike, 450 people, had returned to work yesterday. Therefore, a small number of French Concession buses will also resume operations. He hopes that more people will return to work soon, and the number of buses in service will increase accordingly.</p>
<p>Labor Side Agrees: Six Preconditions</p>
<p>According to the Dazhong News Agency, the preconditions put forward by the labor side are: (1) The company recognizes the union and provides an office allowance of 400 yuan in national currency per month; (2) The 28 workers and other workers arrested during the strike, who were wrongly detained in the Chen Tongzhang case, must be released unconditionally; (3) Increase wages by 60%; each worker should be able to purchase five sheng of rice per day, with the rice price capped at 30 yuan; (4) Additional conductors should be added to trams and buses; (5) Workers should not be dismissed without cause; (6) Wages should be paid as usual during the strike period. Workers who retire due to old age or illness should be given retirement pay by the company.</p>
<p>Two More Workers Arrested Yesterday</p>
<p>According to the labor side, two more workers were arrested yesterday morning: Wang Yougen, driver of vehicle 226, and Lu Yunsong, ticket seller of vehicle 156, were arrested near the Great World entertainment center. Zhang Yongkang, the ticket seller who was shot and killed at Guangci Hospital, is scheduled to be embalmed at the Dazhong Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road at 2:00 PM today. The workers have formed a funeral committee and elected six members as funeral committee members.</p>

<h3>American in Berlin: Applies to Change Surname; Fears Being Mistaken for German; Adds Two Characters to Original Surname</h3>
<p>The English-language "Great America Evening Post" reports that Arthur Berlin, an American residing in Shanghai, applied to the U.S. Consular Court in China to change his surname. This morning (30th), he received approval from U.S. Consul General Helmick. The applicant's reason for changing his surname is that both he and his wife are American citizens, but because their surname is "Berlin," they are often mistaken for Germans. The applicant strongly opposes German ideas, so he is changing his surname from Berlin to Burling to distinguish himself from Berlin, the capital of Germany. The applicant's lawyer, Mr. Rogers, stated that Mr. Berlin was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, studied there, and then came to China. Since 1923, he has held important positions in the customs service and is now a deputy tax commissioner. Mrs. Berlin was born in England and became a naturalized American citizen in 1933. They not only do not want to be mistaken for Germans, but also firmly oppose the Nazi regime.</p>
<h3>Shooting on Wuchang Road Last Night: Japanese Officer Dies; Japanese Side Conducts Extensive Searches Without Results; Police Department Issues Only Brief Announcement</h3>
<p>The English-language "Great America Evening Post" reports that a high-ranking Japanese army officer was ambushed and wounded last night (29th) in Hongkou. He was sent to the Japanese Military Hospital in Jiangwan, where he died of his injuries at 10:50 PM last night. The name of the officer is not known because the Japanese side refused to disclose it. It is also reported that the Japanese authorities strictly prohibited local Japanese newspapers from publishing news of the officer's assassination, so details remain unclear. However, the Public Concession police released a brief announcement about the case last night: Shortly after 10:15 PM last night, a Japanese army officer was suddenly shot several times at the intersection of Wuchang Road and North Sichuan Road by an unknown assassin. It is believed that the assassin was Chinese. It is reported that the Japanese officer was shot three times, and another bullet wounded a nearby rickshaw puller. After the incident, the entire area north of the Suzhou River became tense. Japanese troops patrolled and sealed off all bridge crossings, prohibiting Chinese from entering Hongkou, and conducted extensive searches in the area north of the river, but the assassin has disappeared without a trace. It is reported that the Japanese authorities are still investigating the case and no one has been arrested. According to Japanese sources, the Japanese authorities announced that they will release information about the shooting this afternoon, and that the officer died in a private hospital, not a military hospital.</p>
<h3>Daylight Saving Time: Schedule to End; Scheduled for Midnight Next Saturday; Clocks Will Be Turned Back One Hour</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council issued a notice yesterday stating that Daylight Saving Time will end at midnight on October 12th. At that time, all clocks in the Bureau will be moved back one hour.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Statement: Attitude Toward Labor Strikes; Only Acting as an Intermediary; No Power to Enforce a Solution; But Willing to Mediate Any Labor Dispute</h3>
<p>Following the recent tram and bus strikes in the Public Concession, the public has repeatedly inquired as to why the Municipal Council has not taken action or issued a statement. Now that the above-mentioned labor strikes have been resolved, this statement is being issued to explain the situation.</p>
<p>Public agencies can only mediate any labor dispute, and have no power to enforce a solution. Implementing mediation too early often proves ineffective, so the utmost caution must be exercised to avoid failed mediation. Moreover, once a labor strike occurs, the situation can change unpredictably. Issuing a formal announcement at this time would not only be unhelpful but also harmful, and could even prolong the dispute. In practice, the Municipal Council pays close attention to the changing circumstances of any major labor strike that affects the public. Once the time is right, the Municipal Council or the Industrial Section will be happy to mediate. This should reassure the citizens of our settlement.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Municipal Council's power to facilitate the resolution of disputes is often most effective when it is not noticed by the public or the parties involved in the labor strike. The most effective method the Municipal Council can take to deal with labor strikes is to invite detached social leaders to mediate, without publicly involving the Municipal Council.</p>

<h3>Evaluation Committee Assembles Authorities; To Coordinate on Suppressing Rice Prices; Order for 30,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Already Completed; Rice Merchant's Speculation Fails, Announces Closure</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee has been suspended for more than ten days. However, the committee, recognizing that the frequent rise in rice prices is related to the security of the settlement, and in order to carry out the wishes of the two concessions and coordinate concrete measures to stabilize the rice market, has scheduled a full committee meeting for 3:00 PM today at its meeting place at 15 Edward Road. The committee issued a notice yesterday. It is reported that the meeting will discuss (1) how to re-evaluate rice prices to stabilize the entire food supply in Shanghai; (2) appealing to the authorities of the two concessions to take effective measures as soon as possible to provide practical assistance. Representatives of the two concession authorities and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce will also be invited to attend today to provide instructions. However, all sectors hope that the committee will re-evaluate rice prices based on the arrival and sales of rice, production costs, and inventory, and announce them to the public and implement them effectively.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Yih Ho Foreign Company's "Mingsheng" ship brought 11,217 bags of foreign rice directly from Haimen, and 7,026 bags from Hong Kong. In addition, the company's "Xinsheng" ship brought 1,410 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. The source of foreign rice is constant.</p>
<p>Order for 3,000 Tons of Rice Completed</p>
<p>The rice inventory in Shanghai is extremely abundant. According to surveys, there are more than 600,000 bags. This does not include rice retailers or rice purchased and hoarded by citizens. It is estimated that there are tens of thousands of bags of such rice. To prepare for rainy days, various rice merchants in the city have taken advantage of the low production costs of foreign rice and telegraphed Saigon to order 3,000 tons of foreign rice (i.e., 30,000 bags). The order was officially completed yesterday morning after receiving a reply telegram. The rice will be shipped to Shanghai in an endless stream in half a month. According to sources, the 3,000 tons of foreign rice were ordered by Shenji Foreign Company. The price is said to be 79.5 yuan per bag for No. 2 Saigon rice.</p>
<p>Rice Merchant Closes Due to Speculation</p>
<p>In recent days, the rice market has seen a proliferation of unofficial transactions, and the price increase has intensified. Yesterday, the highest market price for domestic rice even exceeded 90 yuan per dan. However, these transactions are purely illegal, buying and selling empty. Thus, general speculative rice weevils are making huge profits. However, some rice merchants, regardless of the amount of rice that has arrived at the port, have issued a large number of transaction orders at high prices, falsely claiming that the foreign rice will arrive or has already entered the warehouse in order to obtain huge profits. Today, Tonghexie Rice Shop at 339 Pike Road has closed down due to losses of more than 100,000 yuan from these illegal transactions, making it difficult to maintain operations. According to rice market sources, the shop has been selling large quantities of rice at high prices in the market every day, but these transactions are all buying and selling empty, resulting in this outcome. General speculative rice pests should be warned and avoid repeating this mistake.</p>
<p>Demands for Special Regulations</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Citizens' Federation appealed to the authorities to quickly plan measures to stabilize the rice market, and advised all sectors to actively participate in group rice purchases, stating that "Food is the most important thing for the people. Recently, rice prices have skyrocketed, causing not only the poor to be in dire straits, but also the middle class to struggle to make a living. If this continues, what future will there be for society?" In addition to petitioning the relevant authorities to quickly plan effective stabilization and suppression measures, and requesting the promulgation of special regulations to severely punish those who manipulate the people's food supply for profit, the federation hopes that all sectors will actively participate in group orders of foreign rice. The purpose of group rice purchases is to increase the source of rice and enrich the inventory. With sufficient rice, prices will gradually return to normal. At this time, factories, companies, and firms should provide advances for their employees to order rice, so that employees can work with peace of mind. This is the best opportunity for labor-management cooperation. Today, those with some financial means should participate in group rice purchases to leave the market rice for the poor. The method of group ordering foreign rice is quite simple. Please contact the Shanghai People's Food Regulation Association on the third floor of the YMCA in Baxianqiao.</p>

<h3>Catholic Jesuit Society: 400th Anniversary; Approximately 30,000 Members Worldwide; Matteo Ricci, Who Came to China During the Ming Dynasty, Belonged to This Society</h3>
<p>The 400th anniversary of the founding of the Catholic Jesuit Society was on the 27th of this month. Due to the Sino-Western war, the commemoration was very simple. The St. Ignatius Room, founded by the founder of the Xujiahui Jesuit Society, held only three days of prayer, with the Holy Eucharist displayed from morning to night. The 29th (the last day) was a Mass of Thanksgiving in the morning, during which Father Cai Zhongxian described the history and work of the Jesuit Society. The Great Eucharist Blessing was held in the afternoon. The Jesuit Society was founded in 1540 by Ignatius of Loyola, a Spaniard. The Society was dissolved once from 1773 to 1814. Matteo Ricci and others who first came to China during the Ming Dynasty to preach belonged to this Society. There are currently approximately 30,000 members worldwide. In China, their parishes include Shanghai, Xuzhou, Anqing, Wuhu, Bengbu, Xianxian, Jingxian, Daming, Macau, and Zhaoqing. Aurora University in Shanghai, Xujiahui Observatory, Library, and Tianjin Institute of Industry and Commerce are all hosted by them. The Jesuit Novitiate and Seminary are located in Shanghai and Xianxian. Each parish has a history of missionary work being compiled. The Sacred Heart, Holy Body Army, and Ciyin publications recently published in Xujiahui all have commemorative texts published.</p>
<h3>Nanyang Model Middle School Student Tao Zhengcong Kidnapped Yesterday; Brother and Sister Go to School Together in the Morning; Kidnapped When Car Arrives at Peicheng Girls' School</h3>
<p>At the entrance of Peicheng Girls' School at the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road and Jing'an Temple Road, another kidnapping case involving a middle school student occurred at around 7:39 yesterday morning. The kidnapped person was Tao Zhengcong from Zhenjiang. Three kidnappers dragged him out of the chartered car and forcibly took him into a car (number unknown) that had been placed beside the road, and sped away westward. The details of the incident are recorded below:</p>
<p>Brother and Sister Go to School Together</p>
<p>The child Tao Zhengcong is from Zhenjiang, is 14 years old, and resides at No. 35, Lane 274, South Chengdu Road. He previously studied at Weifeng Elementary School on Datong Road, and graduated this summer. He just transferred to the first grade of Nanyang Model Middle School on Nanyang Road.

At 7:39 yesterday morning, Tao and his sister followed the usual routine of taking a chartered car to school.</p>
<p>Sister Just Gets Out of the Car, Brother Suddenly Kidnapped</p>
<p>When the car arrived in front of Peicheng Girls' School at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Xiaoshadu Road, Peiling got out of the car and entered the school. The chartered car driver was about to start driving towards Nanyang Road when, unexpectedly, three men jumped out of a car that had been parked nearby. Two were wearing suits and one was wearing a long gown. They surrounded the car, threatening with guns, and forcibly dragged Zhengcong out of the chartered car. During this time, the child shouted for help and grabbed the driver's trouser legs, struggling to resist. However, the number of kidnappers was much greater, and they eventually dragged him into their car and sped away westward.</p>
<p>Father Passed Away, Lodging With Uncle</p>
<p>Because it was early in the morning, there were many pedestrians on the road, and the onlookers blocked the road. The Peicheng Girls' School authorities heard the news and reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. When the detectives arrived, the kidnappers had disappeared without a trace. The chartered car driver was detained at the police station for investigation. Afterwards, it was learned that Tao's uncle was named Yanghong, was nearly ancient, and was a warehouse director at the Yanye Bank on Beijing Road. According to his family, Tao's father had passed away. After the war, they came to Shanghai to seek refuge and lodged with his uncle. He and his sister remained in Shanghai to study, but were coveted by bandits. Some say that the chartered car they were riding in was a unlicensed car from the lane entrance.</p>

<h3>Escorting Huge Sum of Money to Shanghai; Two Conspire to Embezzle; Nanjing Tongcheng Qianzhuang Remits 45,000; Reported Theft to Small Inn Exposes Conspiracy</h3>
<p>Chen Zemin, an employee of Tongcheng Qianzhuang in Nanjing, was entrusted by Jin Zhongheng, the manager of the qianzhuang, at around 2:00 PM on the 29th of this month to carry 45,000 yuan in legal tender by car to Shanghai to be deposited at Longchang Qianzhuang at No. 453 Sichuan Road. Unexpectedly, Chen had evil intentions after arriving in Shanghai.

<p>China Merchants Hotel</p>
<p>Opened Room 12, put the legal tender in a small yellow leather box, and handed it over to Cheng Yunpeng, the accountant of the hotel, from Changshu, for safekeeping. He and Gao Yuren, the tea servant (a relative of Chen) from Zhenjiang, conspired to embezzle this large amount of money. He then reported to the Si Patrol Station, falsely claiming that he had arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing and was surrounded by six thugs near Henan Road and Laobazi Road. Two thieves pointed guns at his chest and stole a black rattan suitcase containing</p>
<p>45,000</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Intensifies Training: Overview of Intermediate Technical Personnel, Divided into Long-Term and Short-Term Training, Cultivating Thousands of Technical Personnel</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airlines News) Since the Ministry of Education's Department of General Education established a vocational section, with Supervisor Zhong Daozan concurrently serving as the section chief, vocational education has been handled professionally. Over the years, the undertaking has been exceptionally vigorous. In September of the 26th year [1937], all provincial vocational schools with a basic foundation of equipment were ordered to promptly establish various technical training classes or supplementary schools. In the summer of the 27th year [1938], Central, Chongqing Zhonghua, Dagong, and other public and private vocational schools were designated to train driving, telecommunications, and mechanical training classes, with preferential treatment, to encourage the concept of youth respecting technology. In the summer of the 28th year [1939], all classes of students graduated, and were very welcomed by the production sector, with salaries ranging from sixty to one hundred and twenty yuan per month. The government, recognizing the effectiveness of this short-term training and the needs of society, raised significant funds to expand the scope of training, designating Central Industrial, Tongji Advanced Technical, Sichuan Diezhi, Zhonghua Vocational, Dagong Vocational, Chongqing Advanced Technical, Chengdu Advanced Technical, Nanchong Sericulture, Yulin Industrial, Sanyuan Gonghua, Kunhua Advanced Technical, Jiangxi Industrial College, Nanchang Industrial Vocational, Changsha Advanced Technical, Fujian Advanced Technical, Pingle Junior Vocational, Central Midwifery, Jiangsu Medical College, National Pharmaceutical College, and Neijiang, Mianyang, Tongzi, and relocation area health stations, and other public and private schools and institutions to run fourteen or five kinds of training classes in machinery, electrical engineering, telecommunications, civil engineering, surveying, applied chemistry, wool weaving, printing, sericulture, agricultural product manufacturing, accounting, dispensing, midwifery, and nursing. A total of one thousand plus students, all junior high school graduates, some from the war zone, and some recruited locally, with all expenses fully covered by the government. The training period is one year. According to reports from various schools, many parties urgently need students, and before the training period is complete, they are asking the schools to send them to work. Among them, machinery, telecommunications, surveying, accounting, midwifery, and nursing are the most in demand. In the second half of the 29th year [1940], the government, considering the circumstances of each subject, plans to continue to hold training classes to meet the needs of youth and society. The training classes are divided into ten subjects: (1) Machinery (lathe work, fitter, foundry, forging, model making, auto repair), (2) Electrical Engineering (electrical machinery, telecommunications), (3) Civil Engineering (architecture, surveying, roads), (4) Applied Chemistry (leather making, paper making, paint, ink, waxed paper), (5) Dyeing and Weaving (printing and dyeing, cotton weaving, wool weaving), (6) Printing (plate making, typesetting), (7) Small Crafts (stationery, daily necessities), (8) Agriculture (agricultural product manufacturing, sericulture, aquaculture), (9) Commerce (accounting, clerical), (10) Medical Affairs (midwifery, nursing, dispensing). Eligibility requires junior high school graduation or equivalent and aged seventeen to twenty-two. This is a short-term training method to solve the urgent need for technical personnel. The fundamental solution still relies on long-term training. Central Industrial, Tongji Advanced Technical, Chengdu Advanced Technical, Changsha Advanced Technical, Zhonghua Vocational, Dagong Vocational, Fujian Advanced Technical, Jiangxi Industrial College, Anshun Practical, and other schools have been designated to establish intermediate mechanical and electrical technology departments from the 30th year [1941], recruiting junior high school graduates for three years of on-campus training and one year of off-campus factory internships. This year, a total of twenty classes will be recruited, totaling one thousand people. In the future, recruitment will continue every year. All tuition, fees, uniforms, work clothes, books, medical expenses, etc., will be waived, and subsidies and production bonuses will be appropriately given. The treatment is more favorable than the short-term training classes. The goal is to cultivate two thousand people within five years, and then graduate one thousand people each year, to be assigned work by the government, with a service period of three years, during which they may not engage in other occupations, to emphasize the government's intention to cultivate specialized talents. In recent years, the areas where short-term training classes and intermediate technical departments have been held have been centered in Sichuan. First, there are more students from the war zone, and second, educational opportunities are also sufficient. Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Jiangxi and Fujian are next. The northwestern provinces have not been able to give much consideration due to the lack of appropriate schools. Adjustments should be considered later.</p>
<p>In addition, for the technical training of senior high school graduates, the government recently ordered the engineering colleges of national universities and a few private universities to add mechanical and electrical engineering classes, totaling one thousand people. In the future, recruitment can continue. This training, after four years, will be followed by a one-year internship in a factory. All expenses are provided by the government. Future work will be assigned by the government, and there is also a service period. The designated schools are Central University, Jiaotong University, Southwest Associated University, Wuhan University, Tongji University, Zhongshan University, Guangxi University, Hunan University, Northwest Institute of Technology, Jinling University, Chongqing University, Yingshi University, Zhejiang University, and others.</p>

<h3>Charity Basketball Challenge Match Third Game: Alumni of Guoguang School to Play, Postponed to Thursday Evening This Week</h3>
<p>The Charity Basketball Challenge Match, after deciding to continue, the third game, originally scheduled to be played by Liangxi, was scheduled to be held on Wednesday evening. However, due to the fact that the venue of the China Youth side had other uses, it was decided to postpone it to Thursday (October 3rd) evening. At the same time, Wang Nanzhen, the main player of Liangxi, returned to his hometown the day before yesterday because his beloved son was ill, fearing that he would not be able to return to Shanghai by Thursday. Therefore, it was decided that the Guoguang alumni, who were originally scheduled to play in the fourth game, would advance to Thursday (3rd) for the competition. Tickets are also sold in two types: two yuan and five yuan. However, those who have already purchased Liangxi tickets, if they need to watch the Guoguang alumni game on Thursday evening, please exchange them for tickets for the Guoguang alumni game at the original sales location before 5:00 PM on Wednesday, otherwise, please purchase them separately, and keep the purchased Liangxi tickets for use when Liangxi plays. The tickets for the Guoguang alumni vs. Paramount on Thursday evening are scheduled to go on sale at various sales locations starting at 2:00 PM this afternoon, still limited to 800 tickets, until sold out. Currently, tickets for all games, except for the Shanghai Youth vs. Paramount game, such as the Guoguang alumni, Liangxi, and Qunyi games, have already started pre-sale and can be purchased starting this afternoon. Shanghai Youth tickets will not be available until next week at the earliest. The Guoguang alumni team was one of the top three in Shanghai in its day, but it has been disbanded for two and a half years. This decision is purely for charity and has been reconvened. However, due to the dispersion of players, only seven people are available. However, one of the main players, Bao Songyuan, is currently a member of Paramount. As usual, he cannot work for his alma mater again. However, Guoguang intends to borrow a player from Paramount, as the matter is charitable. In the talented Paramount, even if talent from Chu is used by Jin, it will not damage it in the slightest. On the Guoguang side, with the addition of this new force, the strength should be doubled.</p>

<h3>Opium and Life</h3>
<p>How should children be filial to their parents? How should wives encourage their husbands? What kind of faithful advice should relatives give? What kind of encouragement should friends offer?</p>
<p>In this era, in this environment, opium can no longer be smoked, and it is absolutely unacceptable to continue in this way. However, in general, opium smokers all know that they must quit, and everyone feels the danger and pain. When a gun is in their hand, it is not carefree and happy, but full of sorrow, resentment, and hate. However, why don't they quit and escape from this life of misery? To most people, it is because smokers lack determination, but there are also other reasons. It must be known that most smokers have clever minds, and they know that if they don't quit, they will be finished, with no happiness, no hope, and no future. As for those who think very clearly but still refuse to quit, their children, wives, relatives, and friends should also bear some responsibility in addition to themselves.</p>
<p>Some children, because they are filial to their parents, are unwilling to persuade them to quit their habits. Even if their parents want to quit, the children will not allow them because they are old and weak. Some wives, for husbands with habits, are afraid that their husbands will suffer pain when they quit, so they do not encourage their husbands to quit smoking. At the same time, relatives and friends often say ambiguous words, which make people's will waver. In fact, the more you smoke today's inferior opium, the worse your body becomes. The pain of quitting, the rebound after quitting, and getting sick after quitting are all problems for the doctor. If the doctor you hire is knowledgeable and experienced, and uses the most reasonable method, there will naturally be no such problems. It must be known that quitting smoking is not a child's play. If you blindly delay hiring people to quit, or randomly purchase various medicines, the smoking addiction will still exist, and diseases will only multiply.</p>
<p>Recently, because of the problem of quitting smoking, this reporter interviewed Dr. Lai Gongliang, an expert in quitting smoking, and now writes down Dr. Lai's conversation so that people can know the reasons why quitting smoking is ineffective. Dr. Lai said: Quitting smoking is much more difficult than curing diseases. Because everyone has their own physique, everyone has their own temperament, as well as the amount of smoking, the depth of addiction, and the environment, etc., are all different. Therefore, if you do not have rich experience and use methods that are comprehensive, it will be difficult to achieve considerable results, which is what is meant by "a hair's breadth of difference leads to a thousand miles of error." Therefore, I (Dr. Lai's self-proclaimed) have been quitting smoking for more than ten years, and I have almost never used the same method for those who quit smoking. Those stacks of thank-you letters are the result of my hard work. One more thing, my quitting smoking does not seek speed and does not use injections, which also shows my hard work, because haste makes waste, and injections often have many drawbacks, and are not as stable as using the kingly way to quit. According to Dr. Lai's treatment for quitting smoking, there are four major characteristics: (1) increased diet, (2) stable sleep, (3) smooth bowel movements, (4) refreshed spirit. During the period of quitting, Dr. Lai guarantees safety, health, and normal work. And be responsible for completely removing the remaining toxins and never relapsing. Now, in order to gain the trust of those who quit smoking, a method of dispensing medicine for trial is stipulated. Those who aspire to escape from the sea of misery should no longer be delayed and blindly followed under the correct consciousness. Dr. Lai Gongliang's address is No. 208, Baker Road, Public Concession, telephone number 95111, inside the Public Health Hospital.</p>

<h3>Finance: Possibility of Further Appreciation of the US Dollar, Hong Kong China Bank and Commercial Bank Quote 7.5 Yuan, It is Heard that Britain Will Ban the Free Pound Price in Shanghai</h3>
<p>After the United States established a $25 million loan to China, the black market in Shanghai immediately saw its exchange rate rise. Although the establishment of a military-economic alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan gave the exchange market a considerable blow, the United States immediately contacted the Soviet Union on the one hand, and further expanded the scope of the embargo against Japan on the other, so the exchange market still tended to appreciate.</p>
<p>Sure enough, yesterday the exchange market closed with the British gold at 3.53125 and the US dollar at 5.625. The US dollar fell sharply, appreciating sharply by 21875 compared to the previous weekend, and at the close, banks were unwilling to purchase it even when sold at 5.65625. The fundamental reason for the sudden rise in the US dollar yesterday was the US $25 million loan to China to maintain its foreign exchange needs. However, from China's own perspective, the commercial exchange rate of the US dollar in the China and Communications Banks has been quoted at 7.5 yuan. Its calculation method:</p>
<p>The current exchange rate of the US dollar in Shanghai is suppressed a lot by speculators due to the free pound price of more than 3.7 yuan. If calculated according to the Shanghai pound exchange rate of 3.5 pence, the US dollar should also be 5.86 US dollars.</p>
<p>It can be seen that the appreciation of the US dollar has its inevitability. And since the United States has given China help in foreign exchange, Britain intends to ban the Shanghai free pound exchange rate so that it can be made according to the statutory pound price in New York so that speculators cannot use the exchange rate. Based on the above, it can be seen that the legal tender against the US dollar has a greater possibility of appreciation in the future. (Central)</p>

Check other woolen and kersey, which are made and woven in Shanghai, but no matter what Chinese, British, or Japanese factories, they all have no ability to spin and weave, so there is no output, resulting in a shortage and popularity, and the price is soaring.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market and Foodstuffs Fall Back</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market was relaxed due to foreign exchange. The association's prices were: current price 24 crude white stocks at $78.80, down $0.07, foreign stocks at $78.50, down $0.05, Holland cotton white BS mark at $75, Holland red spot fell $1.50, to $60, Taikoo car white B mark first fell $0.50, then returned to the original price, to $75-$76, DY mark $74, down $0.03, HHX mark $73.50, down $0.05. Domestic sugar arrivals and stocks were scarce, without much change, and there were also few transactions. Check sugar arrived from Hong Kong yesterday in 905 bags.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Prefecture Red Dates First Disk Has Been Opened, Peach Meat Fungus Prices Rebounded</h3>
<p>A total of sixty-eight bags of new products of red dates in the government have been fully arrived yesterday, and they have been opened immediately, and the price is $44, which is 5-6 yuan higher than the old goods. It is said that the goods were purchased by the Guang Gang. After the new peach meat has fallen in price, it has not been opened for a long time, and now it has returned to tightness. Nearly 160 baskets have arrived, and the market yesterday opened to $200, and the number of points was passed, rising $20-$30.</p>
<p>The black fungus market had previously risen and then loosened again, retreating to within the $400 mark, but in the end the stock bottom was thin, and now it is trending higher. Shangqiu ears had been opened to $448, and Sichuan ears had been called to $500. Although it has not been completed, it can be known that it is firm. General goods are sold for $400-$430, and ordinary Kui ears are sold for $640, and the rise is even greater.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: New Soybeans Source Obstructed</h3>
<p>Recently, the soybean market, the new and old have slightly different trends, the export market is ordinary, and the way out of this street is also slack, because the public has accumulated goods in their hands, so the old bean market is softer, but the source of new beans, although there are leaks from the net, is fundamentally blocked, and the market is quite prosperous. At the moment, people are unanimously optimistic, but if they follow in the footsteps of the rice market, they are afraid of being subject to public opinion, so there is no mad market. Yesterday, it was estimated that 700 bags of Qingdao beans were traded, and the price was $35.20-$35.50, two cars of Nanjing beans, and the price was $33.80 and $34, more than 400 bags of Sangyuan beans, and the price was $34.50, and more than 130 bags of Chongming sand yellow, and the price was $33.20,</p>
<p>Also, soybean oil arrived yesterday (30th) from Qingdao in 150 pieces, and 2,440 cans of raw oil arrived.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Cement and Steel are Stable</h3>
<p>The hardware market has seen a revival in recent days, because the inland river gangs and the northern merchants all have the intention to advance, and the number of daily collection is quite considerable, in addition, the construction gang of this street and various manufacturers are also not constantly embellishing, so the hardware market, which has been without God for a long time, has seen some dawn, and it is expected that actual sales will present a lively atmosphere. The goods that are announced to rise in hardware products are cement and steel bone after the current nails and white iron. The most widely sold product is the local construction gang, in addition, the inland river gangs of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and the merchants of Jin, Tobacco, and Qing also purchase from time to time, so the market has changed a lot, and the industry has followed the trend. The disk is stable and firm. For example, 3-4 points are called 1,150 yuan, and 5 points to 1 inch are sold for 1,100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Guangdong and Hong Kong Sales Are Booming, Sales Disk Not Much Honor or Disgrace</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: Yesterday's cloth market was still good because the actual sales were good, so although the gold was falling sharply, the sales disk was still able to maintain balance, and there was no glory or disgrace in the coarse cloth and fine cloth, and the fine oblique was firm because there were not many chips. Guangdong and Hong Kong helped colored cloth and colored oblique were increasingly prosperous, with more than 10,000 pieces traded. Wood Street colleagues had good thoughts, and continued to handle 500-600 pieces of various goods.</p>
<p>East cloth: The morning and afternoon fell, and the faucet fine cloth fell $0.75 per piece due to the dumping of speculators, and the guest sales of middle-grade fine cloth and fine diagonal were still strong, with a drop of $0.35-$0.50. In terms of actual sales, the market price was loose on the outside and tight on the inside, and the closing price of the faucet fine cloth was $33.90, and the closing price of kersey was $0.97.</p>
<h3>Overcoat Fabric Is Short and Expensive</h3>
<p>The trend of overcoats has been very popular recently. It can be said that the price is also very expensive, and the sale price is also very expensive, and the supply in the market is very rare, and the supply in the market is scarce. Fabric of all colors is in short supply, regardless of quality. Since the outbreak of the European War last year, there have been very few orders, and due to environmental factors, it is not possible to place orders. Even if there are occasional orders, the cycle is uncertain, and the arrival at the port is delayed by half a year or more. Although there are orders, their arrival is difficult to predict. Check other woolen and kersey, which are made and woven in Shanghai, but no matter what Chinese, British, or Japanese factories, they all have no ability to spin and weave, so there is no output, resulting in a shortage and popularity, and the price is soaring.</p>

<h3>Hardware: Cement Steel Stable</h3>
<p>The hardware market has shown a revival recently, because inland river merchants and northern merchants all have the intention to buy, and the number of daily collections is quite considerable. In addition, local construction gangs and various manufacturers are also constantly embellishing. The hardware market, which has long lacked vitality, has seen some light, and it is expected that actual sales will show a lively atmosphere in the future. The goods that have been announced to rise in price in hardware products are cement and steel bars after the current nails and white iron. The most widely sold of these is the local construction gang. In addition, inland river gangs in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and merchants from Tianjin, Yantai, and Qingdao also make purchases from time to time, so the market has changed a lot, and the industry is showing a clear trend.

<h3>Fennel Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Recently, the price of fennel has continued to rise due to high production costs and difficulties in shipping, making it hard to acquire. As a result, the supply is very scarce and the market inventory is low. Therefore, the market price has increased again, rising by about twenty points, with yesterday's market price reportedly at two hundred and fifty yuan.</p>

<h3>Editor's Note</h3>
<p>Where women should ultimately go is a major social issue of the present day, and also a pressing issue for women today. After selecting and publishing "The Wife's Sacrifice" and "Not a Sacrifice," this publication has received feedback from some readers. We are now specially publishing "Facing the Women's Question," "Is it a Sacrifice?", "Cannot Agree," (this article will be published later), and Mr. Yan Zheng's "Not Just 'Sighing' Alone," among other articles. We feel that the motives and attitudes of all the authors are very good, which is gratifying. If other readers (especially female readers) can contribute meaningful opinions on this issue, we are happy to publish them as well. - Editor</p>
<p>Women</p>
<h3>Facing the Women's Question</h3>
<p>— Sha Yuan</p>
<p>This publication successively published "The Wife's Sacrifice" and "Not a Sacrifice" on August 17th and 26th, and the authors were both "married men." Naturally, what they talked about was more personal and real. I, on the other hand, am a "bachelor," and the subtleties of this are something I have not yet appreciated. But that doesn't mean I'm not qualified to participate in this discussion. On the contrary, every Chinese son and daughter has the right and obligation to speak, and what's even more important here is that women, who make up half of our total population, should stand up and discuss this personal issue themselves. I think the editor of this publication would be willing to publish it within a possible scope, right? At the same time, I hope that this issue can arouse widespread attention and debate, because this issue is realistic and important.</p>
<p>Indeed, as these two original authors said, the former's wife's "sacrifice" and the latter's belief that his wife is living a meaningful family life are both undeniable. In reality, these situations exist in society, and there is a large number of women living under these circumstances. Therefore, we should face this problem squarely, rather than ignoring or denying it, let alone deliberately disregarding and obliterating it. Denying this reality easily becomes fantasy, and obliterating what exists will turn into "Ah Q-style" passivity and retreat!</p>
<p>At the same time, the shortcomings of the two authors are that the former is controlled by "emotion" and "sadness," unable to find a way out in the dark road of present society; while the latter's mistake is that he believes that in addition to managing household affairs and educating children, a woman's only "sacred" mission in the family is to "comfort her husband" (to prevent the husband from becoming passive), and the reverse shows an air of "egotism" with "men as the center." This kind of thinking is unacceptable and simply sinful—writing off the power of half of our total population of women with one stroke!</p>
<p>If Hitler's slogan "Women should go back to the kitchen" were to be applied, then in China, at least, a different society would have to be put in place, because Chinese women have not yet reached the point of competing with men for jobs. On the contrary, we still have to promote women going out into society. In particular, we must see clearly what kind of society the future society will be. Will it still return to the economic panic of capitalism and imperialism, fearing that women will "invade" men's positions? Or will the construction of a new China require the strength of 250 million female compatriots? If the answer is the latter and the strength of female compatriots is needed, then even if we take a step back—to put it more pessimistically—now should also be a period of burying our heads in preparation—preparing how to welcome the new China growing out of the rubble. Some people say that educating one's children is not a preparation for the future? That's right, that's one way, but that's just preparing for your children, and you yourself are unable to meet the new needs. Or, in other words, I have already found a substitute—my children—and I am old and can ignore it. This view is not correct. Let the readers distinguish it for themselves! Besides, the training of children has a larger place for collective training—the school, which is always much larger than the family circle, and will not be bad for the children.</p>
<p>As for saying that it is to comfort her husband, then this husband's outlook on life today is problematic in itself, let alone other things.</p>
<p>Therefore, the works of the two of you are realistic, but they are not the content of the new reality—they only see the surface phenomena of the problem, and do not see the essence of the problem and its development. Therefore, one feels sentimental, and the other has to imagine based on his own subjective view!</p>
<p>However, we feel that the solution to the problem is painful in this transitional period. However, things will not be sent up to us. Doing it still requires our own efforts to fight for it, and the rational solution to the women's problem will undoubtedly be achieved when the entire nation is liberated. Therefore, the current preparation should also be suitable for future needs, otherwise, if we want the ideal to be realized, and we "sit and wait for a good harvest," then the days will be even longer! And it will not be the turn of those who do nothing. At the same time, if we do not work hard for the overall situation, then women will never be able to turn over.</p>
<p>The wheels of history are cruel. If you don't keep up, you will fall behind and be eliminated!</p>
<p>Essay</p>
<h3>Is it a Sacrifice?</h3>
<p>— Xiao Yun</p>
<p>In the Free Talk a few days ago, Mr. Yan Zheng said that his wife, after marriage, "began to bury herself in trivial family matters... tossing and turning in the vegetable market, the kitchen, and the bedroom," believing that this was a "sacrifice," while Mr. and Mrs. Chen Ming "believe that a woman managing household affairs and taking care of children at home is also a career" and "not a sacrifice."</p>
<p>Is it really a sacrifice?</p>
<p>I believe that the key to the problem lies entirely in the different views on the current social system.</p>
<p>A person who has no dissatisfaction with the current social system (that is, the past social system), and believes that the status quo can continue to be maintained, will inevitably feel that it is a matter of course for women to manage the home and not a sacrifice. On the contrary, if you feel dissatisfied with the current social system, and believe that it needs to be reformed so that women can also make direct contributions to society, then you will think that restricting women to the family circle is an unreasonable and significant sacrifice.</p>
<p>Therefore, the problem is very simple: is this social system reasonable? Should a capitalist, male-centered society exist forever? Can women make contributions to society just like men? If women are given equal education and opportunities to come to society, will their contributions to society be greater than simply managing the home?</p>
<p>Is it a sacrifice? The standard is here, please see for yourself.</p>
<p>Although it is a matter for the future, shouldn't short-sighted people be able to see it?</p>
<p>Hawthorne Detective Case</p>
<h3>The Homecoming of the Dancing Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Hawthorne frowned and shook his head, saying, "You misunderstood. His sneer is only the trigger for my worries, the main cause is still the case itself... Alas, this case is really complicated."</p>
<p>"Although, isn't this case almost over now?"</p>
<p>"Over? It's not even close, it's still far away!"</p>
<p>"I really don't understand. Now that the three suspects have been caught, the immediate task is just to think of a way to get them to confess one by one——"</p>
<p>Hawthorne suddenly shook his right hand holding the cigarette. "Is it that easy? Paul, don't be impatient. This case is by no means as simple as you estimate. At most, you can only say that half of it is completed. You must know that the three suspects you mentioned may eventually 'only be suspects.' Then how can you end it immediately?"</p>
<p>I let go of the cigarette and said in surprise, "What? Could it be that none of the three could have committed the murder—not even Zhao Boxiong?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne threw away the cigarette butt and replied, "What we need to study now is no longer a matter of possibility, but a matter of fact. To be honest, I don't have confidence in the facts. What's the use?"</p>
<p>I felt that Hawthorne's words were too vague and too abrupt, which made it impossible for me to imagine. But at this time, my opportunity to ask questions was interrupted again. The phone rang. Hawthorne hurriedly stood up to answer the call. The result of this call did not seem to increase his depression. Because when he returned to the sofa, the muscles on his face seemed to be more relaxed than before. He automatically told me, "This is Qin Mozhai calling. He said that Dr. Bai has returned from Zhenru, and within an hour or two, he can report the results of the autopsy."</p>
<p>Just as he finished speaking, the doorbell rang again. Before long, Shi Gui had led Jiang Anna in.</p>
<p>She had changed into a pure blue Indian silk cheongsam, and the clutch bag she was holding in her hand was also blue. The red on her lips and cheeks had also been reduced a lot. (123)</p>
<h3>Not Just "Sighing" Alone</h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I read Mr. Chen Ming's great work "Not a Sacrifice" in today's "Free Talk," and I admire it very much.</p>
<p>I remember that my writing "The Wife's Sacrifice" was entirely inspired by emotion. At that time, I was motivated by emotion and had no time to carefully consider it, so I wrote it down frankly. It is inevitable that there are shortcomings.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, it caused Mr. Chen Ming's antipathy, or rather, reaction. After reading "Not a Sacrifice," I felt that his words were much better than mine. After observing its implication, it seems to be similar to mine. However, at that time, I used "I don't know how many people have sacrificed like my wife!" as the conclusion, which was not just "sighing" alone. Because what is now placed in front of the Western clothes men are two distinct paths: go to society or go to the family! I always thought that women still have to return to the family, which is the defect of the current social system. What my conclusion implies is an attack on this social system, even if it is weak! And Mr. Chen Ming only saw the word "sacrifice," thinking that this issue should not be understood in this way, and also said, "Handling household affairs and educating children are a woman's career." He lightly covered up that defect!</p>
<p>I do not agree with Hitler's driving women back into the family. The so-called "saving the country from one's own position" is only a temporary solution in my opinion. I belong to the "faction that opposes maintaining the status quo."</p>
<p>My humble opinion is like this. Perhaps due to different environments, the views are different. In my case, if my children have good places to entrust them, I will try my best to urge my wife to do some social work. Suddenly, I announce this, and respectfully ask for your guidance!

<h3>October Drama Movement</h3>
<p>— Sent by Sen from Chongqing</p>
<p>Vitality of Free China</p>
<p>The October drama movement in free China is vigorously unfolding, according to reports from various sources:</p>
<p>Chongqing (Wartime Capital)</p>
<p>This year, the Chongqing drama circles are commemorating the Drama Festival. In addition to the decision by the Third Drama Festival Performance Committee that the "Long Live China" and "Roar!" troupes, along with the Central Propaganda Department's Experimental Troupe, will each present a multi-act play, the "Long Live China Troupe" will also rehearse ten major plays, including Chen Baichen's "Autumn Harvest," Xia Yan's "Mind Defense," Ma Yanxiang's "A National Traitor," Song Zhi's "Whip," Lao She's "Zhang Zizhong," Cao Yu's "Peking Man," Guo Moruo's "Qi Jiguang," and Yang Hansheng's "New Twin Cities," "Heroes of the Wilds," and "Spring in Jiangnan," in preparation for launching a broader and more enthusiastic drama movement in Chongqing.</p>
<p>Shaoguan</p>
<p>The wartime art gallery established by the Guangdong Provincial Government in August has undergone many planning improvements since Shu Yan took over as lecturer. As a result, the drama movement has become unusually widespread. At the same time, the Guangdong Drama Monthly Association, in response to the "Dramatists' Aircraft Donation" campaign, has decided to jointly perform spoken dramas during the October Drama Festival, and local artists have also agreed to participate in the performances.</p>
<p>Kunming</p>
<p>After the war, the Kunming drama movement has not declined. More than a dozen large and small theater troupes have been established. In addition to the most famous "Associated Universities Drama Troupe" organized by students from Nankai, Tsinghua, and Peking Universities, there are also the "Tongji Drama Troupe," "Yunda Drama Troupe," "Art Teachers Drama Troupe," "Jinma Drama Troupe," "Hailing Drama Troupe," "Yelian Drama Troupe," "National Defense Drama Society," and the "Yishi Drama Troupe" presided over by Bishop Yu Bin. Each troupe has a rural performance team attached to it. Due to the changing situation in Vietnam, the October drama movement will focus on rural touring performances in order to deeply penetrate the people.</p>
<p>Guiyang</p>
<p>Due to the changing situation in Vietnam, the situation in Kunming is quite tense, and government agencies are evacuating one after another. As a result, Guiyang has suddenly become more lively. All sectors of Guiyang originally planned to have the Postal Workers' Union perform a spoken drama during the October Drama Festival in response to the fundraising campaign to purchase aircraft. Now, due to this, the plan has been changed, and it is planned to select scripts from the drama circles and cooperate in turn to perform in various parts of Guizhou Province.</p>
<p>Ji'an</p>
<p>Since the fall of Nanchang, Ji'an has become the administrative center of Jiangxi Province. Following the "Warm Clothing Donation Movement" of the press, the "Dramatists' Aircraft Donation Movement" was launched. The Ji'an drama circles naturally did not want to lag behind and immediately began to mobilize. There, spoken drama, Peking opera, and local opera have achieved a unified pace, moving towards the October drama movement.</p>
<p>In addition, in Guilin, Yong'an, Jinhua, Chengdu, Yan'an, and other places, the drama circles are also preparing separately to engage in the October drama movement. This will undoubtedly leave a bright miracle in the history of Chinese drama and is worth writing about in detail.</p>
<h3>Hedy Lamarr's Divorce</h3>
<p>— Lu Li</p>
<p>Hollywood's most beautiful foreign actress, Hedy Lamarr, divorced her new husband, Gene Markey, yesterday. The reason was that her husband was always away from home, and he only spent four days at home with her in the fourteen months after their marriage. She could not bear sleeping alone and decided to divorce.</p>
<h3>Hollywood Film People Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>Al Doff is the representative of Universal Pictures and recently arrived in Shanghai via New York and Hollywood. He recently gave a speech to foreign reporters in the city, saying: "Since Britain and Germany started fighting, the American film market in Europe has inevitably been affected to a considerable extent. However, sales in London have increased compared to the past; in addition, the Far East is also quite satisfied."</p>
<p>Then, he added: "All companies are now working tirelessly on film production, which is an excellent phenomenon. Taking Universal as an example, twelve films are being shot simultaneously in the studio this month, breaking the company's historical record. Six more are being prepared for shooting later, each of which is expected to use one million yuan of capital. However, one point must be stated to all sectors: although the production of war films has recently been very popular in the film industry, producers are not very excited about it. Therefore, such products will gradually disappear in the future. If there are any, they will mostly be filmed with the capital of private institutions."</p>
<p>Doff also raised two important issues: "This autumn is the time for the US presidential election, and Hollywood will, as usual, issue extra newsreels for this event; this year, a few reels will be specially filmed for each candidate. The second is the issue of Hollywood talent. There are indeed many newcomers, but there is still a shortage of talent to deploy."</p>
<p>Finally, regarding Deanna Durbin's new work "Spring Parade," Doff introduced it with extraordinary enthusiasm. He hopes that movie fans will not miss it when it is released.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Teaching Drama Fellows, Guofeng Drama Society, Approved to Open on October 6th</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Teaching Drama Fellows' Guofeng Drama Society has been organized internally. After being approved by the general meeting a few days ago, it was decided to open on October 6th at No. 7 Hexingfang, Foch Road. It is planned to invite Mr. Yu Qiaqing and Mr. Yuan Ludeng to deliver the opening speech on that day, and to invite more than ten famous female Peking opera singers from the north and south, including Wu Suqiu, Tong Zhiling, Wang Xichun, Yun Yanxia, and Xiao Linghong, to cut the ribbon. The Shanghai Actors' Association has already made a wooden plaque and presented it to the society. Many other celebrities, ticket offices, famous amateur performers, and colleagues from the north and south have donated silver shields, silk banners, calligraphy, and other items. It is said that invitations to the ceremony have already been sent out, and it is expected to be a grand occasion at that time.</p>
<h3>Wang Xichun Stars in "Song of the Separated Luan"</h3>
<p>The female lead in Golden Star's third production, "Song of the Separated Luan," is a pitiful woman. After discussions between director Wu Yonggang and Golden Star officials, it was believed that Wang Xichun was the most suitable personality. Wang was very interested in working on the screen, so she agreed as soon as it was mentioned. The male lead has been set as Shu Shi. Shu originally intended to withdraw from the film industry, but after Zhou Jianyun explained it to him, he agreed to cooperate. According to Zhou Jianyun, "Family of the Qinhuai River" was test-screened yesterday. The whole play is quite tense, and several newcomers from the stage, such as Sun Jinglu, have also had unexpected gains. However, the whole film is very long, and the cost will be relatively large when printing copies later, but it is not planned to cut it in order to make the whole play full from beginning to end. (Haixing)</p>
<p>Brief News (1) Miss Ma Zhanghua, a Yue opera performer, will be engaged to Mr. Bao Xin'chu from Fenghua on October 5th. It is said that the engagement ceremony will be quite grand, and the Mandarin Duck certificate and silk invitation cards issued by Xie Wenyi of Wangping Street will be used, which are exquisite. (2) The special issue of "Sea Hero Zheng Chenggong" was published the day before yesterday, with abundant illustrations and texts. Wei Ruhui, Wu Yonggang, Liu Qiong, Gu Lanjun, and others all personally wrote articles for it. It is sold for 3 cents at all newsstands and the Swire Theatre. (3) The second volume, twelfth issue of "Bi-Monthly Drama," edited by the Plum Blossom House Master, was published a few days ago, with increasingly substantial content. All news vendors are selling it on consignment.</p>
<h3>Movie Fans Don't Recognize the Great Lover</h3>
<p>— Guest</p>
<p>Once, the movie fan's great lover, Xiche Luomiou, was wandering alone in San Francisco. He stepped into a magnificent hotel. At this time, a beautiful girl approached his table and began to accuse him of not dressing up like Romeo, so as not to tarnish the personality of that famous star. Just as he was about to argue that he was Romeo, the stubborn girl asked him to produce some evidence. So Romeo unbuttoned his clothes and showed her the name specially made for him by the tailor on his shirt. Unexpectedly, the girl pointed at his eyes more angrily and scolded, "Humph! Humph! You're wearing an old shirt!" After saying that, she left coldly, making Romeo, who was good at teasing others, blush. Because since he was the darling in the eyes of women, he had suffered the disdain of a woman who admired him. It was really "Unable to tell the suffering, a mute eating coptis!"</p>
