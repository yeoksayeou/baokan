<p>社評</p>
<h3>義大利參戰之後</h3>
<p>義大利卒於十日傍晚、由首相墨索里尼，揭去暫不參戰的商幕，向英法宣戰。這是歐戰第二階段中的大開展。</p>
<p>義國參戰的總因，在於領土經濟諸問題，對英法兩國要索不遂；其近因在於英法為作戰而厲行封鎖政策，未許義國　例外；其選擇參戰的時機，在於德軍連戰連捷，直逼巴黎的前夕；個中關鍵，有如本報所再三申論。回溯既往十個月。外受交戰國雙方的趨蹌奉承。內有敎皇的溫婉規勸。旁有美國總統苦口婆心的疎解斡旋；高踞了舉足重輕的地位，把握了操縱自如的機樞，欲決不決，若即若離；這一時期的義大利眞是尊榮無匹，可以睥睨羣倫。形而下之，小而言之，在物質方面。他國正在消耗實力、而義國得整軍經武，增進比重；他國不遑經濟建設，而義國得刺激百業、疾趨繁榮。天授之，人予之，義國獨享之。不料所謂暫不參戰為暫祇十個月，終於參戰。當然，目前世論的褒貶不足憑，往後史家的判斷不必問；勝敗不可知，窮通否泰不可知，為百年計利害得失不可知；却由暫不參戰、一轉變而離棄袵席，自此入水火，敝屣玉帛，自此化干戈、則冉不是暫的問題了。</p>
<p>在墨索里尼先生所視為不足憑，不必問的、乃至其他種種為任何人所不可知的，我們請暫時保留着不說。但是墨索里尼先生方寸之間的這一轉變，究竟對於現階段的國際局勢，將有何種波動，將生何種可能的後果？我們情不自禁的試作瞻望。</p>
<p>在戰言戰吧：義大利的車事總力量，有多多不能與德國相提业論之處；他在不久之前，幫了弗朗哥將軍從事於西班牙的革命，勝利了。成功了，　辛苦艱難，遠小如德國在北歐西歐打勝仗的爽脆；這是嶄新的試騐，或許是有效的鍛鍊！但在義國對英法宣戰後，從首當其衝的法國方面米觀察，則在危困之際，實在不容菲薄任何一方面來的新敵人。兩面受敵，無異兩個德國。何况這時候、英國遠征軍大郃份纔撤回本國，第二批遠征軍據說纔首途；所以在最近將來的短時期內，實是一個法國與兩個强敵對抗。法國將如何渡過這一難關，以迄戰局穩定？這是英法兩國共通的燃眉課題。雖義大利不參戰，法國對義國亦不能在軍事方面無所防備，然亟所尤亟，當然先將後備軍儘量的源源向北綫增防，以當德軍的鋒銳，以從事於巴黎的保衛，現在則不得不把全部軍力分配於南　兩綫。假定法軍應付義軍並不十分棘手，甚至迎頭痛擊，卓著戰功；然對德作戰的力量既因分散而半减，當然使穩定北綫與保衛巴黎的困難，為之倍增。甚至因此而不得不早作放棄首都之計，亦在意中。宣戰是雙方的全面戰爭而決非局部戰爭，但攻守不必盡同而待決於戰略；現在我們還不知道義大利在殖民地方面是否同時發動攻勢。如果同時發動，則菲洲大陸是戰爭的又一面，形勢渾沌，而地中海方面則海軍優勢屬英法，義大利當然有其嚴重的遭遇。假定義國在菲洲在地中海不取攻勢，然央法在軍事上乃至政治經濟上的必要，亦有其先發動的可能。海上戰爭發動後，則在英法海軍絕對優勢之下，西起直布羅陀，東至亞丁、吉布地一帶區域，必然的仍在英法掌握；甚有可觀者，乃為義大利有大規模試騐其空軍的機會，而英法有由海軍力量而大振聲威的機會。</p>
<p>可是今後的開展。已決非單純的軍事問題；由義國參戰，使大局加添了複雜萬倍的國際政治的意味。蓋義大利一天不參加戰爭，則「和平攻勢」云云是一天存在的：此其功效與意義，及其價值如何，是另一問題，但義大利一開始參戰，這一可能已經完全消失。和解既絕望，使美國，西牙班，以及巴爾幹各國，各有立即重行考慮態度的必要。大勢所趨，回天乏術，這些國家，大概都會直接間接地，或先或後的，捲入大戰漩渦。國際友敵的分野，容留極度幻變的餘地；若從國際政治的常理來觀察，則英法與國較多，而德義較少；若謂德義聲勢，以目前為其最高峰，而以後將與日俱降；亦無不可。因此之故，德義常前的戰略，還在迅急地擊潰法國、先行結束大陸上的戰事，使國際政治不發生何種演變，即使演變，使他不及影響到大陸上戰事的成敗。此在英法方面，當前第一要着，在於先行挽救法國方面的頹勢，穩定戰局，把戰爭推進於長期的狀態。原來英法方面最近階段中的陸軍大敗，與其斷言於其軍力的與德國懸殊，母寗斷言於戰略的錯誤：蓋法國統帥迷信了馬奇諾防綫。而疏忽了敵軍從別方面的進攻。若以兩方軍力而論，最後勝敗雖不可知、但相當期間的相持局面，確有其可能。他們勢必長時期狠鬬，而今日的局外人却未必得長時期的從旁靜觀！</p>
<h3>美決加緊以特制資源　援助英法反抗暴力　調解失敗羅斯福言之痛心　責義以利刃猛刺鄰邦之背</h3>
<p>佛吉尼亞州查洛維爾羅斯福總統昨在佛吉尼亞州大學發表演說、謂美朝野對於義大利加入戰事之决定、殊感不緊急及嚴重之不安、美洲各共和國對犧牲生命血液而與武力及憎惡之神相搏鬥的各國表示同情，目下吾人將同時沿遵下列兩項顯明之途徑、即以本國之物質資源協助反抗武力者、同時更將調整並加速此項資源之利用、俾吾人在美洲之人民得有設備及訓練、以應付任何緊急之事故、完成此兩項目標之一切途徑、必須肅淸所有之障碍、目前所有之徵象及信號、皆喚起吾人以充分之速度向前邁進、羅總統籲請美國人士以努力·勇敢·犧牲·及懇摯應付時艱、並述及美政府如何勸阻義國參戰之經過、謂渠曾提議倘使義國不加入戰爭、渠願要求有關係各國對於實行義國所願望各項調整事宜之任何協定、予以忠實履行之保證、不幸墨索里尼對此提議之辦法、竟不願接受、渠又曾表示美政府願於適當之時機與義政府從事合作、藉裁减軍備及建設更自由之國際經濟制度、而創造一種更穩定之世界秩序、但義國因保持其所謂「行動上之自出」、及實踐其對德國之諾言起見、竟表示不顧其他國家之權利與安全、與直接感受戰爭擴大危脅之無數人民生命、並表明不願作以和平手段而達到其願望之嘗試云、</p>
<p>按羅總統演詞之前段、曾向孤立派份子作下列之諷示、謂若干人士仍抱持目前顯已錯誤之概念、即以為美國可任其國家在此武力哲學所控制之世界中成一孤立之島嶼、此種孤島或將成為現仍以孤立派名義發表談話及投票者之迷夢、渠及今日大多數美國人民之目光中、此　孤島小啻為一種人民之無助的夢魔、此種人民喪失自由、雙手被拷、處身監獄、每日需由其他大陸態度侮慢及毫無憐憫之主人由鐵窗中授食以療飢、目下吾人亟宜自問如何可以防止此項監獄之造成、而使吾人得免置身其中云、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>羅斯福總統本日在尼亞大學發表演說於述及義大利决定參戰一段時、在宜讀其預定演說稿之後、忽臨時插入一語、責義國暗箭傷人、以匕首刺法國之背、其言係謂、一九四〇年六月十日手執匕首者、已將匕首刺入鄰人之背」云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>自意大利於前晚六時（即上海時間三時）宣佈對英法戰爭後、本市情形、突吿緊張、蓋英意防軍於租界防防區內、已成成對峙形勢也、但英意防軍高級當局、為維護地方治安、避免雙方部下在咖啡室及其他公共塲所相遇時發生衝突起見、特下令禁止所部防軍、不得外出、同時、各國防軍司令復正在計劃、敵對軍隊人員、祇人員、祇可在指定地點遊覽或活動、意軍絕對不准進入法租界、聞昨晨美國海軍陸戰隊司令派克、曾接見各國防軍司令、計有英·法·意·防軍司令等、法司令與意陸戰隊司令、於昨晨接得意大利參戰消息後、亦曾有會晤、彼等同意以全力維持租界現狀、旋意司令並與日陸軍人員、在成都路意總領署　會談、所討論者亦係維持租界地位問題、</p>
<h3>美必竭力維護現狀</h3>
<p>本埠美國官塲方面、昨對義大利參戰後上海租界之局勢、及英法義三國等防軍問題、表示私人見解云、美國期望于本埠英法防軍與義國防軍、在上海採取和平措置、共維治安、美國在上海方面擁有權益、必竭力加以保護、協同各國防軍、維持租界現狀云、至公共租界內之英軍防區、沿靜安寺路及新閘路一帶者、為美海軍陸戰隊麥令隊、昨晨起已略事戒備、並酌派其小組巡暹隊、巡暹其防區、又悉美駐滬海軍當局宣佈、本偉海軍人員、不得吿假離職、另候命令、再行定奪、同時美海軍當局尙採取維持治安之方案、目前尙不能公佈、</p>
<h3>英人不准對意貿易</h3>
<p>本埠英國駐華大使館、佈吿限令一切英商行號及項藉人民、不准與意商行號交易、否則以與敵人交易之法令論罪、此為意大利參戰在本埠所發生之反應、又意國橋民有存款於英法銀行、及項法僑民有存款於華義銀行者、因恐有沒收情事、均紛紛趕在管理方式提取、致昨日上得各該銀行頓現繁忙之象、迨後各該國僑民悉並無意外之</p>
<p>事發生、始各釋然、</p>
<p>英意防區暫不隔離</p>
<p>據美陸戰隊司令部外報記者稱、為維持敵對軍隊間和平起見、現擬採取特種步驟、其辦法與中國紀念日相同、巡還部隊將增加、同時並加强防禦工作、但美陸戰隊不擬派隊將英·意·滬丁防區隔離、凡入法租界探訪家屬者、可尤其直接往目的地、惟不能在街道中游覽、聞昨日下午、已有水兵多名、為巡暹隊所扣留、</p>
<p>英法德意在滬武力</p>
<p>軍界方面、對德竟攫磁偏計租界謠言、認為不確、據謂駐滬意兵衹有二百二十人、目所有武裝、均係小型、絕不能與法軍對抗、德方可集中者、亦祇有已受過軍事訓練者八百人、法軍方面、則實力約有二千人、英軍為一千六百人、美陸戰隊、亦不下一千六百人、據云、各國防軍已同意、合作維持租界秩序、俾日軍無法藉口「意外事件」而開入租界、英法意三國海軍、目前均有兵艦停泊黃浦江中、計英方有砲艦三搜、法意各有兩艘、此外在戰爭期內、意輪康鐵佛田號將留滬、另有意輪四艘、則已駛往南市封銷紅透以上暫避、又意輪某號、將於明日自甬抵此、亦將駛往南市封鎖綫、暫不復航、</p>
<p>法租界未歧視德僑</p>

<h3>日對租界　不致輕舉妄動　雖心存凱覦但局勢不許　美國隨明監視日本行動</h3>
<p>據熟悉遠東問題之某西人談、日方對於租界、固甚凱覦、但在其尙未變更「不國咊歐戰政策」以前、當不至對租界作暴力奪取之行動、而其是否終於不加入歐戰、雖難斷言、但非至美國無力繼續其為太平洋</p>
<p>安定因素時、日方當不至操切從事、以自取禍、目前美國援助英法動作、誠屬日見積極、甚至參加歐戰、亦非絕不可能、惟吾人應知美國縱參加歐戰、其在太平洋之威力、並不因而减削、良以英法海軍、旣視德義為</p>
<p>絕對優勢、陸軍所現弱點、復不在於兵員缺之、而在軍火不充、美國僅須在飛機大砲戰車方面，予以充分接濟、並以一部船只助其運辦理、事已足、即使非作兵力援助不可、而其赴援者、自亦多屬於陸空軍、海軍仍足監視日本、並掌握太平洋制海權、使日本參戰時寫封鎖所困而販、</p>
<p>日本國力消耗、已達若何程度、孩國掃政者必能知之、念及加入歐戰所必招致之美國壓迫、或覺前途至危、而愼重其動作、惟此非謂日本絕不至於冒險益戰、上海租界絕無危險、華人富有者為謀資金案全、仍以思患　預防、移往內地、投於各種事業為愈、</p>
<p>意使官邸特予保護　法總領事奧琪復稱、傳說法租界當局命令在該區之義僑一律出境、全非事實、彼謂法租界當局負責保護義國大使及其他官員之安全、並否認法租界當局昨晨曾命令金神父路一一八號義大使官邸隆下義國國旗、且法租界當局昨晨復派遺大批警捕守衛義大使官邸、以防衛任何不測事件發生、惟義國軍用汽車數輛、於昨晨曾停於義夫使官邸門前、搬運物件、</p>

<p>晨初以倫敦大條近跌三七、五、遠升一八七五、紐約銀價仍平、倫教生余呆定、匯兌英對美不動、對滬縮〇六二五、對法未更、美對英跌三角、對滬降五角半、對法小一角五分、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士八七五、美匯五元六八七五、較之假前、英微鬆〇三一二五、美則猛長一五六二五、乃匯兌重告劇落之故、開後市况不定、大致因歐局義大利正式宣戰之影響、人心虛弱、華投機商咸有出無進、最初外行納入六月份美匯由五元六八七五以至九三七五、現象頗硬、後美行與外行會對做現美匯定為五元八七五、匯豐掛牌揭曉、英匯仍未變動、美匯緊二五、此後港電亦來吐塞、而華商投機家依然不絕賣出、計港電出匯豐現先令告四辦士、外行進投機商本月份美匯已為六元及六元〇三一二五、又有利售予外行同月美匯亦告六元、將近午刻、日行等俱塞、市面大鬆、六月份美匯硬達六元〇六二五、又華商投機商賣與美行現美匯恒做六元〇〇六二五、故收盤英金四辦七〇三一二五、美匯六元〇六二五、本月份與現貨同價下月份英金三辦士九三七五、美匯五元九〇六二五、比晨開現貨英鬆一五六二五、美硬三七五、</p>
<p>美金最鬆六元一一五</p>
<p>午後賣勢更鬆、初有和售出六月份美匯與沙遜為六元一二五、乃因沙遜吃胃不惡、致一時頗形平定、及後投機商仍為主要賣戶、拋出六月美匯為六元一八七五、而吐出現美匯賤至六元二五、結果收盤尙穩、現貨英金四辦士〇六二五、美匯六元一八七五、本月份與現貨同樣、七月份英金三辦士九六八七五、美匯六元、較假前、英金期現均長二一八七五、美匯現貨及本月份鬆三四三七五、七月份硬三一二五、</p>
<p>香港匯先緊後回</p>
<p>香港十一日（週二）電、今晨匯市開盤動盪不定、英匯現期均告小動、美匯現貨緊一元二五、為二十一元七五、（昨開為二十三元有行無市）、申匯現貨降十四元、為三百七十元、（昨開為三百八十四元、有行無市）、日匯現貨有行無市、九時五十分告平、美匯現貨鬆一二五、為二十一元八七五、申匯現貨回升二元、為三百七十二元、十時二十五分平定、英匯現貨續鬆一二五、為二十一元、十一時三十分平定、美匯現貨冉鬆一二五、為二十二元一二五、其餘均無榮辱、下午二時三十分開盤告鬆、美匯現貨所長三七五、為二十二元半、申匯現貨回降　元、為三百六十三元</p>

<h3>歐局不堪聞問　黃金竟然黯淡無色　低盤見五千二百元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、疲風日甚、一日瀉落、堪稱猛烈、雖中途尙有盤旋、但維持不易、主以滙市奇鬆、乃歐局之發展現狀、及義大利之宣戰、促使經營者寒怯、認為多頭損多利少、故急以脫售者與時俱增、晨初開出尙穩、略撳五十元、為五千六百元開盤、嗣錢兌業金號來吸、而跳起五十元、究因滙市陸續報硬、檯面買氣淡薄、遂降至五千三百七十元、午收亦僅五千三百八八十元、後市開盤不振、　一度微抬後、竟墜落達五千二百元低價、是時聞證券帮金號力出、又傳德軍將達巴黎、收　前雖錢兌業乘賤買入、曾告回升、但結果祇五千二百八十元、（收後尤覺軟弱、最後照收價最低三十元、尙難找買者）、較上週六軋跌三百七十元之巨、全天交易約四千數百兩、銀樓首飾余終亦猛落四十元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤跌三百七十元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以報載義國業經參戰、但黑市美滙因受英鎊猛跌而緊、故開時人心尙穩、低撳五十元、金號互做三十兩、為五十六百元、嗣賴錢兌業金號及銀號等搜買、未幾即回起五十元、金號進證券帮二十兩、為五千六百五十元、旋滙市轉鬆、賣風復起，金號銀號帮紛紛止扒為塞、而斯時買戶極少、不久猛跌二百元、余號出證券帮二十兩、為五千四百五十元、後以證券帮及錢兌業撈進、遂回升七十元、錢兌業對做三十兩、為五千五百二十元、卒因此後外滙愈硬、賣者接踵、重告不支、竟父慘落一百五十元、金號出銀號五十兩、為五千三百七十元、繼而錢兌業進金號十兩、為五千三百八十元作午收價、午後開時、人心愈疲、大衆競賣、銀樓帮出證券帮二十兩、僅為五千三百元、嗣證券帮金號等買人、曾見回升六十元、證券帮進金號三十兩、為五千三百六十元、　因外滙尤鬆、目傳德軍已抵巴黎近郊、是以賣者羣集、某證券帮拋塞尤力、不久傾瀉一百六十元、金號出銀號五十兩、為五千二百元、旋後賣風漸息、金號錢兌業乘賤猛撈、遂回升一百五十元、錢兌業進金號三十兩、為五千三百五十元、入後銀號帮及現金號賣出、再降七十元、銀號出金號三十兩、為五千二百八十元、作晚收價、結果比上週六在跌三百七十元、查已連小三天、共跌八百二十元、收後又降至五千二百六十元、全天四百五十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、然烚赤較高十數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>首飾金頻跌四十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出初時大同行仍懸五百八十元、迨至九時三十七分、掛小十元、九時五十分又小十元、十時十五分回起十元、十一時二十五分復小十元、十二時〇五分又低十元、午後二時半再低十　、此後無變化、結果共小四十元、計大同行改懸五百四十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>義已參戰　外幣突降</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、以義大利已對協約國宣告參戰、此後歐局將有重大變化、因此人心惶惶、烚赤暴落三百餘元、英美金鎊不乏供給、市價一致慘落十元、黑市外滙大鬆、英滙突出四便士大關、美滙長出六元關、英美金票賣氣光彌漫、美金票於午後曾退至十五元九角、晚市略回上至十六元、比上週六暴落一元三角、英金票以五十一元最低價收盤、香港票以港滬滙兌銳落、故亦跟隨下游、此外如新加坡·羅比·坎拿大·菲列濱票等亦均不乏供給、市價一致下疲、日金票及朝鮮票趨勢均軟、前者退為一元零九分、後者降為九角三分、</p>
<h3>證劵　外股劇落　內債亦興奮</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤、昨日市况轉起跌風、市上賣氣甚盛、趨勢甚疲、大都因中日戰爭至為混沌、人心不無惴惴、且每一屆將付息相近時、忽有此不良之印象、致引起懷疑、故雖在金子狂跌時、亦不能照習慣上之為即回漲、和平空氣雖有、咸認為單方之造謠、本埠謠言、因義軍參戰而加熾、人心益見軟化、多方際此、大都思逃避之方而出籠、在此種環境中、前途暫尙不易看好、昨日開市、適已經過兩日之休假、舊歷午節已過、賣氣突盛、開出後、即逐步下游、益昌聯益賣出最為踴躍、樂茂鴻大亦紛粉多方脫手、二十六號及鴻康頗有買進、散戶吸收前後相接、甲種敲破六十一元、乙種退進二元、丙戊種均進五十元關、丁種有賣無買、竟未能開出、午後市氣較平、但仍毫無起色、鼎　仁昌買進、樂茂收回乙種、聯和益昌同康仍有賣出、進出尙屬平衡、一日結果、除丁種全日未能開出外，餘均略小二角至三角半、成交總數約計為八十萬元之　、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股蔡交易成交大中華火柴公司股一百股、價為二十二元五角、</p>
<p>衆業公所股市、因義國宜戰、紐約市塲劇落、價格莧日虛軟、下午初因謠傳巴黎陷落、賣氣更濃、跌勢轉劇、繼因所傳不能證實、價又部份回高、終以人心動盪不定、倐漲條跌、難以持久、英聯股開盤二十三元（除息）、下午曾見十九元一角低價、收盤二十元、怡和股走數更劣、開盤三十三　半，　低見二十七元二五、收盤亦祇二十八元、　廣股十元做起、逐步下降至九元一角、收盤略回至九元三角半、即過去數日內、始終站穩之中營股、昨亦由八元開外價、跌至七元七八角、會德豐老股、頃宣佈末屆股息五元、殊使一般人失望、市塲始料之數、遠不止此、公司所能派者、自可較此為優、惟際茲非常時期、採取審愼措施、諒亦不能為人詬病、橡皮股成交極少，價格概較假前為低、</p>
<p>倫敦十日（週一）電、今日央商遠東各公司股柴掛牌行市、祇滙豐銀行股疲落一鎊、英倫註册股為七十七鎊、香港註冊股為八十鎊、其餘不動、　倫敦十日（週一）電、今日中國外債掛牌行市、仍告平穩、上下檔各債券、概無變動、</p>
<h3>糃食　米價狂漲無止境　一號西貢高至五十七元　常幫淸粳暗盤六十二元</h3>
<p>米市昨爲節後首盤、因經兩朝休市、實銷應需亟亟且又渡過節關、銀根寬舒、投機者亦思蠢動、故晨初開市、首見內地幫爭辦、繼之鄕莊客戶競搜、均不以售方之乘機居奇而退縮、且覺再接冉厲、蓋因霉令秧期、天時似覺太旱、致內地價格高昂、轉販而往、厚利可獲、復因本街店舖點綴、及投機者從中興風作浪、市面遂突飛猛進、無論國洋兩米價均暴漲二三元之巨、若洋米一號陳西貢曾開五十七元、火絞五十五元半、小絞五十三元半、其國米傳聞塲外暗盤、常幫特淸粳竟打破六十元大關、造成滬埠素未有過之六十二元最高峯、直迨收市左近、內地客銷停手、與乎金跌匯長、投機者乘高將獲利貨紛紛出籠、漲勢方殺、各價回貶半元、</p>
<p>洋米昨晨有內地鄕莊各幫採辦五千多包、本街各戶亦以節後轉活、又因國米不能下種關係、市上買氣極旺、客囤行販與浮戶競相收買、早市乃見暴漲元外至二元之鉅、午市因匯長回小半元、下午匯水再伸、且有數批暹邏二號米五十九元左右電洽外、新有二號西貢五百噸妥交、係六月底七月初裝船價六十元、由仁記洋行售與米商、因此人心向下、晚市尤呈軟象、暹邏二號回籠米早市喊六十元〇八角者、旋開六十元〇五角、至晚市進戶尙圖抑低、而現洋米亦復抑低半元，故昨日洋米初漲後跌、結果雖較大一元、而收市形勢反見軟弱云、</p>
<p>又訊、最近太古公司、瓊州·頴州·濟南·蘇州等四輪、自香港運來洋米共四萬五千八百餘包、已迭誌本報、因裝卸工人罷工、未能起卸、茲悉現已解決、該項洋米、今晨即可起卸、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米、三朝共到一千七八百包、傅聞塲外暗盤、因是貨稀、尤兼洋米飛騰、貨主扳俏、而交易不以價貴影響、應需者辦意愈濃、致價開出造成未有之高峯、除常幫特淸粳六十二元外、其他常崑粳均售六十一元至六十元、靑泗薄稻六十元、而南港早晚稻亦須五十八元、</p>
<p>糯米昨日無到、而銷塲方面、因時令已過、實銷僅有零星胃口、不過浮囤以價廉頗多吸收、致售方心思殊堅、喊聲即隨洋米並起、結果售價較節前提升元半至二元、金溧特元四十八九元、丹常白元四十七元半至四十七元左右、江北白元四十五六元、</p>
<h3>麺粉出品仍限　假期後銷路較活　新小麥到貨仍少</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日交易尙稱活潑、各廠則以維持十三元八角原盤、不肯多量出售、客幫仍無暢辦、南洋幫略有點綴、客盤已昂至十六元二角五分、按照廠方售意、認為原料發生問題、對於客盤尙須提高、齣以金價回降，外滙猛鬆、故市面亦難過好、內地粉與回籠貨老車牌等、均在擯持之中、聞綠山鹿價須十四元一二角、其他各牌售價不一、仍居盤旋之局、又麵粉今日有一千零七十五包、運往烟台、</p>
<p>小麥　連日新小麥逐有零星運到、均係某方有關者、而市塲迄無正式交易、大都日廠向產區收購來滬、至華廠方面、要求疏通小麥來源、尙無切實辦法、故市面在靜待中、</p>
<h3>紗花　假後紗市　跌風又起</h3>
<p>假後之紗市、又復回疲、且跌風尤熾、此因義大利參戰、同時外滙放長、黃金下降尤銳、於是人心虛弱、賣風即起、市盤乃步趨下游、二十支雙馬又復敲破一千一百元關口矣、但實際消化、南方尙稱不薄耳、</p>
<p>現紗晨開聞美滙稍縮、人氣續進、二十支雙馬叫喊一千一百八十元外、詎料一霎閒、滙票轉升、人心頓鬆、賣聲復起，開價現出為一千一百二十元、微漲至一千一百三十五元、但以後塲中流言紛紜，黃金大落、賣戶更湧、市盤逐見下墜、直跌遭至一千零九十元、但收盤之後、再小一二十元、查半日間成交統計一千四百十五元、行情二十支雙馬跌二十八元、今日有紗一百四十二件運寗波、二百八十八件運烟豪、八百三十五件運天津、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<h3>棉價下墮</h3>
<p>本棉交易、因歐洲風雲嚴重、致人心驚懼、加之紗市不穩、廠方納胃旣滯、而同業心意更劣、所以成交尤鮮、完全入於停頓之途、僅申新廠進大中集一百十二件、價為二百二十元、係送廠交貨、較昔日之價、跌去甚夥云、</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日晨初先因受脅方之壓力、後因歐洲消息之不利、及一部份之南方套賣、結果收盤價格、較之上日俱跌三五磅音、印度棉市昨晨照常、但因前售之棉、無法裝運、問題殊為嚴重、昨日因懸案之未能解決、故終日毫無交易、竟成有行無市、昨日預測為一七〇、較之上日跌七羅比、</p>
<h3>疋頭　布疋直瀉</h3>
<p>國布　布昨布市晨盤平平、旋以金價銳降、浮囤跌價爭脫、市　直瀉、細布細斜跌（每疋）元至一元半、粗布跌五角至一元半、餘如漂染印花各布及　布亦莫不貶　兜銷、惟以市氣萎靡、雖布價低廉、仍難引起做多興趣、而實銷客戶亦轉採觀望姿態、故成效數量大减、本街成交当令洋纱·蔴紗·燈芯布·膠布·白嗶嘰·色丁等貨三千餘疋、溫甬幫辦粗布細斜色布一百數十件、</p>
<p>東布　白貨龍　細布、直綫下瀉、較上週市盤、猛跌（每疋）三元五角、蓋上午北路秦皇島幫辦彩球細布、津幫辦下月份龍頭細布、成交達五白餘包、開盤形勢尙佳、龍頭現貨售三十九元三角、卒以本街人心恐慌、一味賣出、步步壓小、至午收盤為三十六元九角、後市因金價在瀉、市氣益衰、龍頭現出跌至三十五元五角、本月份三十六元五角、嗶嘰跌至九角二分半、中檔雜牌細布與細斜尤無人過問、殊鮮售開、</p>
<h3>煤炭　煤球廠盤减低</h3>
<p>煤球行情、日昨因滙市猛鬆、義泰興·國華等煤球、同業廠盤、即日（十二日起、自動减低八元盤子、計開自車棧單、每噸一百三十四元、送釗另加車力、門莊零售每　十八元二角五分、每日市斤七元三角、</p>
<h3>糖市　刁靑略緊</h3>
<p>昨糖市據荷蘭電訊、粗白產價見升、為美金三·一二、但下午美荷滙水見長、故公會劃盤、初平後軟、現貨一四粗白本棧上午七十一元二角、後乏做出、外棧貨初為七十一元、後小至七十元、轉口貨初為五十七元半、後轉疲、六月二十日打棧單為五十六元、即打棧單者五十五元半、小元許、太古車白無成交、荷赤仍六十一元國糖有建幫開出太古輪到刁靑三百包、價六十三元半、升半元、市象平定、又糖昨由荷囒來一千一百頓、</p>
<h3>油餅　油市晨俏午平</h3>
<p>昨油市寫中一般人們、因鑒於內地市面良好、大都心思轉　、故晨盤各油行情、一致比假前挺升一二元、但至午後買氣驟减、市態顯呈動搖、結果一無成交、大局恐起變化、豆餅祗大有餘廠餅略緊一二角、其他平平、銷塲為內地辦牲記餅三千片、汕頭幫進元隆餅二車、泉州興化兩幫辦去大有四牌餅一萬餘片云、</p>

<h3>清淮河中之大王</h3>
<p>向來淸淮一帶，每當春夏之交，潮汎泛漲，河中有大王出入。大王者，身類蛇，而頭則方，隱隱似露雙角，蓋皆河神化身也。老於河工者，類能指其名，曰某大王，某大王；故大王出現，必報漕帥，漕帥乃親赴河干，用盤引之而入，即以漕帥所乘之轎，送至當地大王廟，另設香案祭之，河工各官皆至廟隨班與祭。大王好看戲，立傳伶人演之，必俟大王自去，始可罷演，緣大王旣來此地，或遇河工險要，大王必能保全，故屢荷我朝封典，聲靈　濯，已非一日，但必俟水大之時始見，且出現亦祇有一二，非絡繹而來也。昨聞漕帥衙署，突有大王十餘位，盤列於大堂之上，隨由漕帥用盤盛起，送入大王廟，照舊演戲，恭答神庥，不料旦晚間陸續往來，約已十餘日，現在漕帥飭令戲班，晝夜輪演戲劇，不數日續有數大王，蟬聯而至，現聞共有二十餘位，該處民人聞之，咸嘖嘖稱奇！或曰：今年宜防水患，然則大王之來，殆欲使辦理河工者，預為設法疏導歟？</p>

<h3>「安全」的「責任」</h3>
<p>— 前輩</p>
<p>公共租界將於十七日起實行安全運動週了，本市學生九百餘人也將和去年一樣，協力來推助這一運動，並佐以圖畫及各項宜傳，其收效或許能創造一個「安全」的新紀錄的。不過我還固執着我的意見：「安全運動」果然是行人與駛機者合作的，然駛機者的責任更爲重大。</p>
<p>十路公共汽車一五〇三二號上所發生的一件慘案，可以作爲最有力的一個例子。這慘案的發生，是陳阿發的妻子陸氏「正在攀登銅梗之際，不料車勿開行，的行二十尺之遙，氏因力不勝任，脫手跌仆，致爲後輪軋傷頭顱，立時身死。」</p>
<p>這傷人案開審之際，賣票與駛機發生「撳鈴」之爭。其實無論撳鈴在先，或是先行開車，雙方都推不了責任的，「不料車勿開行，的行二十尺之遙」已經判決了雙方的罪名了。因爲賣票即使沒有撳鈴，在駛行二十尺的時間中難道也不看見一個人吊在銅梗上嗎？公司章程上有「開車撳二響，停車撳「響」，在二與一之間，就證明了如果發生不幸事件的時候，能節省少撳一響的時間來加迅挽救，而現在是「約行二十尺之遙」，你說還有什麽推諉的反證嗎？</p>
<p>至於行人在電車汽車的行列間冒險穿行，或者和汽車電車作競賽者，那自然是自作孽，然而「自作孽」的入終究是少數。</p>
<p>最後我還是以拙文「重擴安全運動」一文的結論爲結論：「安全運動」不是「遊藝會」，駛機也不是一件簡單的機械工作。</p>
<h3>狗</h3>
<p>— 魯明</p>
<p>在不久以前，老闆買了一條小狗，於是在這終日生活在單調的機器聲里的我們，把它當作一件新鮮的玩意兒了。每於工餘之閒，大家都喜歡偃僂着身子，逗着小狗兒玩要。</p>
<p>的確，這是一頭逗人的小動物，生着一身純白的柔毛，終日里跳跳蹦蹦，活潑而可愛。老闆也愛似掌珠，出出進進總少不了它。老闆曾經得意洋洋的對大衆說起過：「我是爲着要解解悶兒纔買它的啦！」</p>
<p>然而，誰會想到呢，就是爲了這一條小狗的緣故，而使我們巳是被壓榨得喘不過氣來的生活中，再添上一些兒意外的工作和辱駡。譬如：每當從龐大的機器上拖着筋疲力盡的身子跳下來以後，還得去作替小狗洗澡和買牛肉等的雜事，有時甚至於還得帶小狗到外面去散步，總之，相同一個主人一樣，我們得平心靜氣去服侍它。</p>
<p>有時老闆把小狗抱在懷里逗着玩，要是遇着他高興的時候，就拉長着嗓子喊阿三買牛肉；倘使阿三稍微走得慢一點，老闆就毫不客氣駡了：「他媽的！懶蟲！」</p>
<p>阿三只翹起嘴唇嘟噥着：「媽的，老子還不如一條狗！」</p>
<p>有一次阿三不留心踏着狗的尾巴，小狗嗚嗚的哭了起來，老闆就拍台拍桌的駡着每個人。此後只要狗在外面叫，老闆也就隔着窗檻怪聲怪氣的叫：「你們得當心哪！狗養的！」</p>
<p>可是有一天不幸的事畢竟降臨了，那就是小狗失踪了。這一天老闆委實發了急，圓胖的臉膛上滾着汗珠，眼睛里滿佈紅絲，用各色各樣猥褻的謾駡加在我們身上，似乎有把我們一口氣呑下去的氣概。不得已我和阿三戰戰兢兢的分頭到外面去找，結果狗被找着了，原來躺在雜物堆里打盹，於是我們的心中似落掉了一塊重鉛</p>
<p>因此老闆和狗就成了我們黑暗生活中的二大魔障，每當悲憤的時候，一種無意識的概念就會很快的掠過腦海：「上帝爲什麼不把我們變成一條狗呢？」的確，我們的生活還不如一條狗！天到晚小斷的勞動着，然而所得的報酬是什麽呢？而我們的小狗要是白飯里沒有肉味，嗅一嗅又走了。</p>
<p>可是有一個熟識的聲音又在耳邊響着了：「因爲我們不是狗，所以不能過那像狗一樣的享樂生活；做一個人是應當用自己的雙手去克服一切的困難！俗語說：吃得苦中苦，方爲人上人。只要不斷的和環境奮鬥，總有一天光明會降臨給我們的。」</p>
<p>就是爲着期待光明的來臨，我是不折不撓的不畏一切艱難的和環境搏鬥着。</p>

<p>幼妹在某小學二年級念書，今日從學校放學回來，手中拿了一張紙，上面畫了一隻雞，據她說先生命各人照樣用硬紙做一隻，算是手工成績，星期一交。於是我的工作到了，得替她備齊材料，但是她根本無從着手，倒已忙了許多時候，還是我帮她剪，貼，着色，串錢，彎鉛絲，化了一個鐘頭，方把牠做好。</p>
<p>學校中的手工，本來是訓練兒童的手，使他們不只是能用腦。但是現在一部分小學校（可以說是大部分，因爲鄰居們的小孩也常嚷着叫他們媽媽姐姐代做。）命學生做自己不能做的工作，先生乾脆的說一句：星期幾交！旣不在課堂上做，又不敎以如何做，心照不宜，叫你家長去做。到了交的那天，只要能交了事，也不責問，就批了分數就算過去。</p>
<p>不顧慮到學生的能力，而命學生做自己不能做的手工，我反對，雖然承認代做是我的過失。</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小靑著</p>
<p>第一章「一位挺漂亮的小姐！」</p>
<p>霍桑點頭道：一那也容易解釋，昨夜裏也許有兩個男人進來過。」</p>
<p>倪金壽驚異道：「兩個人？那史麻煩了！」</p>
<p>霍桑淡淡地說：一這交疊的男鞋印子尺寸不同，顯然屬於兩個人。包朗，你最好把這兩行足印用紙鈎摹下來，把深的一行定做甲，淺的一行定做乙。」他隨手將應用品授給我。</p>
<p>我就依照著繪那足印的圖，倪金壽也陪著我用軟尺量。霍桑却向後面樓梯邊望了一望，便先走入左手的門口裏去。我把印繪好以後，覺得霍桑眼光果然不錯，甲印是十一吋六，乙印是十吋四，顯然是不同的。小過乙印不但較淺，而且一出一人，互相混亂，也小像甲印那麽分別淸楚，譬如在西邊進入一行中和中間空處，也都隱的有幾個出去的乙印。接著我就也和倪金壽向裏面的門口走去。</p>
<p>那左手的一室是個會客室而兼書室，很寬大。我和倪金壽一走到鬥口，便有一種慘怖的景狀接觸眼簾。原來這就是發案的所在。</p>
<p>那慘怖景狀的中心點，自然是那被害的退職舞后王麗蘭。伊正坐在靠窗的書桌面前的一張直背皮墊椅上。伊坐的姿勢是向窗口的，但伊的頭仰擱著椅子的背端，臉兒便像在瞧上面的承塵，彷彿一個哲學家對於宇宙之一謎突然發見了新的概念，運思出神，一時間便成了呆木。（十二）</p>

<h3>影迷理想中的愛人　—是賢妻良母型的女子</h3>
<p>好萊塢女明星接到影迷的求婚信，並不是新奇的事，可是根據這些信件，做一個統計，女明星中接得求婚信最多的，並不是那些嬌媚的女郞，却是一個風韻猶存的半老徐娘，她便是在「到好萊塢去」一片中飾瓊家媽媽的斯潑林勃英頓（Spring　Byingto）。在過去十四個月來，她平均每月接到求婚信一百十封之多，比較隨便那個女星所接的求婚信多出三倍。</p>
<p>據斯潑林女士說，我接到這末許多求婚信，當然足以自豪，可是我相信寫求婚信的人，多數祇是被理想鼓動着，所愛的並不是「女人」，原來「瓊家班」影片中的媽媽，性情溫和，一味依順丈夫，且煮得一手好菜，又不向丈夫吵着要錢；不過，我雖飾演瓊太太，恐怕本人並沒有瓊太太那樣的多才多能呢。」</p>
<h3>談平劇中的三字經</h3>
<p>— 可法</p>
<p>三字經」是從前私塾裏。給孩子們開蒙的一本書，係宋代名儒王伯厚所編。皮黃劇中也有「三字經」一劇，是老生的正工戲，專講念白，塲子亦簡單，劇本之編者則不詳。</p>
<p>劇情是叙冀玉李謀正帳下，有臨淮騎都尉溫韜「凈扮」，一日升堂理事，値淮北節度使羅兆威來函，溫鞱使千戶司關卡官（丑扮）念，關卡官接了叫旗牌念，旗牌說不識字。溫韜說：「身爲千戶。連個宇也不識，須要學習學習才好」。溫鞱接過書信，稍看，即命差官回去，吿以照書行事，差官索回信。溫鞱說：「此乃機密大事，你先回去，隨後就有書信到來。」差官去後，溫鞱將卡官叫到後堂，二人本有舊交，說明二人均不識字，然仍不知節度使信內是何事，先欲找識字之兵，繼想恐士卒知不識字而難服衆，溫韜遂想找一幕友，乃命卡官去找。</p>
<p>卡官在街上找幕友，正逢羅英（江東人生扮），因赴試落第，在淮北見羅兆戚，欲集詩百首，並欲與羅英同宗聯譜。羅英因其爲反覆小人，乃大駡一塲改名而逃，路過此地，盤川用盡，以賣字爲生。卡官問之，吿以賣字。卡說：「賣字可會寫字，」羅英答以「不會寫字賣什麼字。」卡大喜，隨與羅央至衙。羅英見溫鞱拱手爲禮，溫反怪其禮貌不週，並觀其行相平常，不信其能通文墨。遂使羅英講解三字經。羅英觀其言談舉動，知爲一勇之夫，不懂文字，遂信口請之，其講法與今對口相聲之「歪講三字經」略同。講畢溫鞱甚喜。即取出節度使之函，羅　讀之，係羅兆威知羅央必從此經過，命溫鞱押送淮北。羅英遂詭稱此人才高智廣，早往關外去了。溫鞱命寫一回信畢，至後堂飲宴。</p>
<p>全劇只有兩塲，第一塲是上小丑卡官，再上溫韜，三上旗牌，第二塲上老生羅英，全劇惟羅英有四句西皮原板，餘下就是念白了。</p>
<p>此劇聞係早年范四寳所排，後張勝奎曾演之。今則除馬連良演唱三次（一次在吉祥。一次在開明。此次在黃金），他伶則未見排演也。</p>
<h3>凱茀蘭茜斯的婚變</h3>
<p>— 莎薇</p>
<p>狄安娜竇萍的第七部新作「花月佳期」（It’s　A　Date），不久又要在滬公映了，裏面除了賽萍爲主角外，還有一個是將要被人遺忘的凱茀蘭茜斯</p>
<p>她——凱茀蘭茜斯在近年來，雖然仍常有兩三部新片問世，但是她的名聲是一年比一年低了，甚至於現在會降到配角地位，如果說那是爲了她演技退落的原因，那在五六年前她最紅的時候，也並不見得比現在好得多，只有短短幾年功夫，一個人的地位會相差這許多，這大概就是所謂「明星運」吧？</p>
<p>當茀蘭茜斯主演「白衣觀音」的時候，在好萊塢是紅極一時的女明星，無論公司當局，影迷們都對她非常重視，非常贊美，可是現在完全兩樣，想起來眞是有點「不堪回首話當年」了。</p>
<p>不但她的事業，是這樣不順利，而婚姻也正和她事業一樣，她結過三次婚，可是每次都失敗。她的第一個丈夫是亞倫雷恩，那時她還沒進電影界在一個名人處當私人秘書，亞倫也就是在那裏認識的，認識了一個月，凱和他就結婚了，這樣冒失的婚姻，不久就因爲志趣不合而吿仳離。</p>
<p>第二任丈夫是一個很漂亮的美男子，後來不知爲了什麽緣故又鬧翻了。凱離開道個美男子之後，就置身影界。在那時又和舞臺演昌開民麥開納發生羅曼史，而結婚，又不合，再離婚。</p>
<p>這樣接二連三的婚變，使她非常傷心，所以她離棄了一切，把身心完全致力於事業—一銀幕，這時是她最傷心的時期，也是她在銀慕上最出風頭的時期。</p>
<p>後來她又墮入了情網，認雷文子爵爲她最理想的伴侶，所以她又第四次結婚了。但不久之前，又有傳說，說她又戀上了一個運動家，這樣下去，她的婚姻又得發生雙變了，唉，她的歸宿不知究竟在何處？</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>After Italy Enters the War</h3>
<p>On the evening of the 10th, Italy, led by Prime Minister Mussolini, finally removed the veil of temporarily not participating in the war and declared war on Britain and France. This marks a major development in the second phase of the European war.</p>
<p>The general reason for Italy's participation in the war lies in its territorial and economic demands from Britain and France not being met. The immediate reason is that Britain and France implemented a strict blockade policy for the sake of the war, not allowing Italy any exceptions. The timing chosen for participating in the war is on the eve of the German army's continuous victories, approaching Paris. The key, as this newspaper has repeatedly stated, is the past ten months, when Italy was fawned upon by both belligerent parties, had the gentle persuasion of the Pope, and the earnest mediation of the American president. It held a pivotal position, grasping a freely manipulable mechanism, hesitant to decide, both close and distant. Italy during this period was truly unparalleled in honor, able to look down upon the masses. From a more practical, smaller perspective, in terms of material aspects, other countries were depleting their strength while Italy was able to reorganize its military and increase its importance. Other countries did not have time for economic construction, while Italy was able to stimulate all industries and rapidly achieve prosperity. Heaven-given, people-given, Italy enjoyed it alone. Unexpectedly, the so-called temporary non-participation in the war was only temporary for ten months, and it finally entered the war. Of course, current world opinion is not worth relying on, the judgment of future historians is not worth asking; victory or defeat is unknowable, good or bad fortune is unknowable, and the long-term gains and losses over a century are unknowable. However, the shift from temporary non-participation to abandoning the comfort of a peaceful life, entering the water and fire from now on, treating jade and silk as mere sandals, turning weapons of peace into weapons of war from now on - this is no longer a temporary issue.</p>
<p>What Mr. Mussolini considers unworthy of reliance, not worth asking, and what is unknowable to anyone else, we will temporarily reserve and not discuss. But what kind of impact will this shift in Mr. Mussolini's mind have on the current international situation, and what possible consequences will it bring about? We cannot help but try to anticipate.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the war itself: Italy's overall military strength cannot be compared with Germany in many ways. Not long ago, it helped General Franco engage in the revolution in Spain and achieved victory. Success was hard-won, far less straightforward than Germany's victories in Northern and Western Europe; this is a brand-new test, perhaps an effective exercise! But after Italy declared war on Britain and France, from the perspective of France, which bears the brunt, it cannot afford to underestimate any new enemy at a time of crisis. Being attacked on two fronts is like facing two Germanys. Moreover, at this time, a large part of the British Expeditionary Force has just returned to the country, and the second batch of the Expeditionary Force is said to have just set off. Therefore, in the short term, it is actually France confronting two powerful enemies. How will France overcome this difficulty until the war situation stabilizes? This is a burning issue common to both Britain and France. Even if Italy does not participate in the war, France cannot be completely unprepared militarily towards Italy, but what is most urgent, of course, is to increase defense as much as possible from the reserve army to the northern front to resist the German army's sharp edge and to engage in the defense of Paris. Now, however, it has no choice but to allocate all its military strength to both the south and north fronts. Assuming that the French army does not find it very difficult to deal with the Italian army, and even strikes back hard and achieves remarkable military success, the strength for operations against Germany is halved due to dispersion, which of course makes the difficulty of stabilizing the northern front and defending Paris doubled. It may even be necessary to make plans to abandon the capital early, which is also expected. A declaration of war is a full-scale war between the two sides, and not a local war, but offense and defense need not be the same and depends on strategy. Now we do not yet know whether Italy will launch an offensive in the colonies at the same time. If it is launched at the same time, then the African continent is another side of the war, the situation is chaotic, and in the Mediterranean, naval superiority belongs to Britain and France, so Italy will naturally have its serious encounters. Assuming that Italy does not take the offensive in Africa and the Mediterranean, Britain and France, out of military, political, and economic necessity, may also have the possibility of launching a pre-emptive strike. After the naval war is launched, with the absolute superiority of the British and French navies, the area from Gibraltar in the west to Aden and Djibouti in the east will inevitably remain in the hands of Britain and France. What is particularly worth watching is that Italy has the opportunity to conduct large-scale experiments with its air force, while Britain and France have the opportunity to greatly enhance their prestige through naval power.</p>
<p>But the development from now on is no longer a simple military issue; Italy's participation in the war has added an infinitely complex international political dimension to the overall situation. The reason is that as long as Italy does not participate in the war for one day, the "peace offensive" continues to exist. What its effect and significance are, and what its value is, is another question, but once Italy starts participating in the war, this possibility has completely disappeared. With reconciliation being hopeless, the United States, Spain, and the Balkan countries each have the need to immediately reconsider their attitudes. The general trend is irreversible, and these countries will probably be directly or indirectly, sooner or later, drawn into the whirlpool of the war. There is ample room for extreme changes in the division of international friends and enemies; if we observe from the common sense of international politics, Britain and France have more allies, while Germany and Italy have fewer. If we say that the momentum of Germany and Italy is at its peak at present, and that it will decline from now on, it is not impossible. Therefore, Germany and Italy's current strategy is to quickly defeat France and end the war on the continent first, so that international politics does not undergo any changes, or even if it does, it does not affect the success or failure of the war on the continent. For Britain and France, the first priority at present is to first save the declining situation in France, stabilize the war situation, and advance the war to a long-term state. The recent stage of the major defeats of the British and French armies is better explained by a strategic error than by asserting that their military strength is significantly different from that of Germany: The French commander was obsessed with the Maginot Line and neglected the enemy's attacks from other directions. If we consider the military strength of the two sides, although the final victory or defeat is unknowable, a stalemate for a considerable period is indeed possible. They are bound to fight fiercely for a long time, and today's outsiders may not be able to quietly observe from the sidelines for a long time!</p>
<h3>The US Decides to Accelerate the Use of Special Resources to Assist Britain and France in Resisting Violence; Roosevelt Expresses Regret Over the Failure of Mediation; Accuses Italy of Stabbing Its Neighbor in the Back with a Sharp Knife</h3>
<p>Charlottesville, Virginia President Roosevelt stated yesterday in a speech at the University of Virginia that the United States, both the government and the public, feel particular anxiety and seriousness about Italy's decision to join the war. The American republics express sympathy for the countries that sacrifice their lives and blood to fight against the gods of force and hatred. At present, we will simultaneously follow two clear paths: using our country's material resources to assist those who resist force, and at the same time, adjusting and accelerating the utilization of these resources, so that our people in the Americas may have the equipment and training to cope with any emergency. All means to achieve these two goals must clear all obstacles. All current signs and signals call on us to move forward at full speed. President Roosevelt appealed to the American people to meet the difficulties of the times with effort, courage, sacrifice, and sincerity. He also spoke of how the US government tried to dissuade Italy from entering the war, saying that he had proposed that if Italy did not join the war, he would request that the countries concerned provide guarantees for the faithful implementation of any agreement on the various adjustments that Italy desired. Unfortunately, Mussolini was unwilling to accept this proposal. He also stated that the US government was willing to cooperate with the Italian government at an appropriate time to create a more stable world order by reducing armaments and building a freer international economic system. However, Italy, in order to maintain its so-called "freedom of action" and fulfill its promise to Germany, disregarded the rights and safety of other countries and the lives of countless people directly threatened by the expansion of the war, and indicated that it was unwilling to attempt to achieve its wishes by peaceful means.</p>
<p>According to the first part of President Roosevelt's speech, he made the following satire to the isolationist elements, saying that some people still hold the currently obviously mistaken concept that the United States can allow its country to become an isolated island in a world controlled by this philosophy of force. This kind of isolated island may become the dream of those who still speak and vote in the name of isolationists. In his eyes and in the eyes of the majority of Americans today, this isolated island is no more than a helpless nightmare for a people who have lost their freedom, are handcuffed, are in prison, and need to be fed daily through iron windows by rude and unmerciful masters from other continents to relieve their hunger. At present, we urgently need to ask ourselves how we can prevent the creation of this prison and save ourselves from being placed in it. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>President Roosevelt inserted a comment on his own, criticizing Italy for stabbing France in the back with a dagger, while giving a speech today at the University of Virginia on the section where he mentioned Italy's decision to enter the war. He stated, "On June 10, 1940, the one who held the dagger has stabbed the neighbor in the back." (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Rome Mussolini declared yesterday afternoon on the balcony of the Palazzo Venezia that Italy's declaration of war had been delivered to the Allied countries and had been notified to the British and French ambassadors in Italy. He then said that the plutocratic democracies of the West often prevented the advancement of the Italian people. Italy had tried its best to contain this mad war, and we have now resolved to confront the dangers and sacrifices of war. We have resolved to fight in the continental and marine borders where our people are now being suffocated. I solemnly declare that Italy does not want to trap other people in this battle on land or at sea. I have told Berlin that the Italian people have a friend and are willing to march in step with this friend.</p>
<p>After Mussolini explained that this was a decision that could not be changed, he declared, "We are declaring war on the plutocratic and reactionary democracies of the West, who are hindering the progress of the Italian people and even threatening the survival of the Italian people from time to time. The most recent facts in history can be summarized in three words: hesitation and half-rejection, frequent threats, and extortion. Our conscience is absolutely at peace. The whole world and you have witnessed that Italy has done its best in humanity to avoid the mad sweep of Europe, but all efforts have been in vain. It would have been enough if the democracies could revise the treaties to suit the essential needs of the lives of all countries and not regard them as something that could never be touched. It would have been enough not to insist on a guarantee policy, which has proven to be fatal to those who accept it. It would have been enough not to reject the proposal put forward by the German head of state when the war in Poland ended last October." After Mussolini mentioned that the Italian people were taking up arms to resolve the issue of their maritime boundaries, he added, "We now want to break the chains of iron that shackle Italy's land and military at sea, because forty-five million people, if they cannot freely communicate with the sea, are not truly free. Now the die is cast. Of our own volition, we have burned the bridges behind us. I solemnly declare that Italy does not want to forcibly drag other people who are Italy's neighbors on land and sea into this battle. Switzerland, Yugoslavia, Turkey, Egypt, and Greece should all pay attention to this statement."</p>
<p>On the eve of the occurrence of this historic event, we are embracing the Italian King with sincere hearts and we are also paying tribute to the head of the allied country, Greater Germany (the crowd cheers for Hitler). Laborious and fascist Italy now stands firm for the third time, heroic and united. Italy has never been so before.</p>
<p>Mussolini concluded by saying, "We must win, and finally obtain a just and long-term peace for Italy, Europe, and the whole world."</p>
<p>After Mussolini finished speaking, the crowd cheered wildly. Prior to the speech, a radio station reporter declared that 80 million Germans would listen to the Prime Minister's speech, and that we should pay tribute to them, as we have 150 million people standing united. The report estimated that about 250,000 people had gathered in front of the Palazzo Venezia. They carried giant banners with the names of the places claimed by Italy written on them. All shops were closed and employees were listening during Mussolini's speech. The loudspeakers set up in various squares, restaurants, and cafes broadcast fascist songs and marches before Mussolini began his speech. After the crowd paid their respects to Mussolini in front of the Palazzo Venezia, they flocked to the Royal Palace, shouting "Long live the Italian King!" (Reuters, 11th)</p>

Some units have crossed the river, but they have encountered fierce resistance everywhere. The enemy has sent aircraft to bomb our rear, attempting to disrupt our movements, but without success. (2) West of the Oise River, in the Soissons area, enemy units attacked the Ourcq Canal this morning between the towns of La Ferté-Milon and La Ferté-en-Tardenois. Simultaneously, another unit attacked the city of Fismes from the Ardre River valley, but both attacks failed. (3) In the Champagne area, the enemy launched a two-pronged attack on our forces at dawn today at the town of Rethel. Newly arrived reinforcements, under the cover of tanks and bombers, also participated in the operation.

(4) East of the Aisne River, from the city of Attigny, the enemy intensified its attacks in the Argonne area north of the communication lines from Beaumont to the Meuse River.

<h3>German Aircraft Squadrons Again Heavily Bomb Paris; Large Fires in Parts of the Paris Area</h3>

<p>German Forces Head Straight for Paris in Two Directions; French Premier Inspects the Front Lines</p>
<p>Tours – As German tanks and motorized units charge into the Allied lines from the east and west, attempting to reach Paris, the Allied forces, further stimulated by Italy's entry into the war, are fighting with even greater determination today, striving to stem the German advance on all fronts. French Premier Reynaud personally visited the war zone today to inspect the troops and encourage the Allied forces to fight to the end. The fighting today is intensifying. Although German casualties are heavy, they are still attacking the French defense lines in all sectors. According to French military dispatches, German tank units are charging fiercely into the northwest area of Paris in an endless stream. German infantry are advancing towards Paris from the west. German mechanized and motorized units are frequently increasing pressure on the Allied lines along the Quéquy-Les-Étaples and Frelles-en-Thénies lines, attempting to enter Paris from the east. Military observers point out that the German forces are currently engaging in flanking maneuvers from the east and west, with the aim of encircling the large forests that form the northern screen of Paris and occupying the city. French officials believe that Hitler has indeed driven all his remaining forces onto the battlefield to intensify his attack, attempting to destroy the Allied defenses in one fell swoop. The French High Command ordered this morning that special measures be taken to stop German motorized units from entering Paris from the west. From the coast to the Aisne River, the French army has launched a fierce counter-offensive to prevent the Germans from establishing positions on the left bank of the Seine River. Although the situation is extremely critical, Allied Commander-in-Chief General Weygand declared today that he believes the Allies will regain their strength and defeat the advancing German forces. Military experts believe that based on the countless equipment and manpower of both the Allied and German forces, the current war can be described as a battle unprecedented in history. The German maneuvers from the northwest and west are actually a copy of the Schlieffen Plan. French military authorities have rapidly transformed Paris into a heavily fortified battlefield today, for defensive purposes. The main roads are equipped with tank barriers. Other roads are also equipped with tanks and artillery positions to hinder the attackers' progress. On the French-German border, every village and town has been transformed into a fortress. The enemy will have to suffer heavy losses before crossing these villages and towns and entering Paris. The evacuation of Paris residents continued unabated last night and this morning. Trains, cars, bicycles, and airplanes were all carrying people away from this danger zone. The gold and bills of Paris banks have also been moved to various places, leaving only staff to handle business during this emergency. (United Press dispatch, 11th)</p>

The military observer of Pravda stated, "The German offensive is fierce, and the French resistance is extremely strong, because both sides are aware that this is a matter of life and death. Even if this battle cannot completely determine the outcome of the war, its impact will be extremely significant." The military observer of Red Star stated, "The fortifications of Paris are not very important. If the Germans can reach Paris, the French resistance in the fortifications will not be able to last long." (TASS dispatch, 10th)</p>

<h3>The Main Force of the Japanese Army in Western Hubei Is Trapped in Desperate Situation Under Chinese Pressure; China Is Launching a Full-Scale General Attack; More Than 6,000 Japanese Soldiers Have Been Annihilated Successively; Japanese Reinforcements Are Continuously Arriving, and the Crossings Are Still Being Repeatedly Contested</h3>
<p>Yichang – The Japanese forces facing Dangyang and Yichang have received substantial reinforcements since yesterday afternoon, constantly struggling within China's layered and vast encirclement lines. The battle situation is becoming more intense. The details are as follows: 1. South of the Hanyi Road, from Ban Yue Mountain through Anfu Temple to Baiyangyiqian on the north bank of the Yangtze River, the Japanese forces in this area are most active in using the method of advancing by drilling gaps along the north bank of the Yangtze River, but they are also receiving the most fierce attacks from the Chinese army. Since noon on the 10th, the Japanese have attempted to use large-scale air force cover for their attacks. The Chinese army has used the terrain for aerial concealment, and has also used extremely vast deployments to resist the Japanese step by step. By last night, the Japanese army had suffered about 3,600 casualties, and the offensive was frustrated again. Only a few Japanese soldiers sought gaps to break through, but they were annihilated by the Chinese forces. Most of the Japanese did not dare to advance rashly. This morning, bloody battles resumed, and the Japanese situation was in decline. The Chinese army has strengthened its air defense, and the Japanese aircraft did not dare to fly low. By noon, the battle situation had entered a stalemate. 2. On the main front of the Hanyi Road, the Japanese have been heavily damaged and are unable to advance further. The Chinese army has implemented a main force attack with flexible tactics. From yesterday afternoon to this afternoon, the Chinese army has continuously charged and killed more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers, and the Japanese situation is extremely shaky. 3. North of Dangyang, most of the Japanese forces were driven into the mountains between Dangyang and Yuanan by the Chinese army yesterday morning and are trapped in a disintegrated state. The Chinese army in all directions is not giving the Japanese any chance to catch their breath and is continuing to implement the planned plan, that is, to advance fiercely from the north, east, south three sides of Wuan Mountain to the top of the mountain. The Japanese have repeatedly attempted to break out, but have failed. By yesterday afternoon, Wuan Mountain and the surrounding highlands of Qilin Mountain, Huangmao Ridge, and Wangcheng Mountain to the northwest were all in Chinese hands. By late evening, the remaining Japanese soldiers were finally pressed into the deep and narrow river valley area in the upper reaches of the Jushui River and are now firmly locked by the Chinese in the valley near Yuanan. It is found that this force is the main force of the Japanese army, and it has now been put in a desperate situation and is on the verge of extinction. As a result, the Japanese army on the entire line is extremely panicked, and the doom of total collapse and annihilation is imminent. In summary, since the 10th, the fierce battle lasting day and night has successively annihilated more than 6,000 Japanese soldiers. Seeing that the good opportunity has arrived, the Chinese officers and soldiers are ten thousand times more courageous and have now launched a full-scale general attack, which is progressing fiercely. (Dispatch, 11th)</p>

In order to achieve the goal of annihilating the Japanese, the Chinese army, in accordance with the planned deployment, is fighting more and more bravely. On the 9th and 10th, bloody battles occurred everywhere on the front of about 200 li on the west side of the Xiang River. Although several batches of the Japanese army's large reinforcements sought gaps to commit crimes in the west, their supplies have been captured by the Chinese, and more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers have been killed in two days. (Dispatch, 21st)</p>

<p>Chongqing. Japanese planes have been attacking Chongqing in batches every day, and have been repeatedly defeated and suffered severe losses by the Chinese Air Force. At around 1:00 PM on the 11th, another 117 planes simultaneously intruded into the city's airspace. The Chinese Air Force surrounded and attacked them from all directions. In just one engagement, several Japanese planes were seen wounded and fleeing in disarray. The Chinese planes followed closely and relentlessly, repeatedly attacking. One Japanese plane was shot down and crashed in the southeastern suburbs of Fuling. The Chinese Air Force completed its mission and returned safely in triumph.</p>
<p>Details of Yesterday's Air Raid on Chongqing</p>
<p>Chongqing. Yesterday afternoon, Japanese planes attacked Chongqing in three waves. The first wave appeared at 12:25 PM, dropping multiple bombs on the outskirts of the city along the Chongqing-Chengdu Highway, failing to hit their targets, only destroying some thatched sheds and small houses. The number of casualties is unknown. The second wave of 27 Japanese planes appeared at 1:20 PM, intruding into the airspace over the western district of the city, dropping heavy bombs from an altitude of 9,000 feet, bombing residential areas, and destroying several houses. The French Embassy and the Chongqing Hotel were also severely shaken. Several bombs fell only 40 yards from the French Embassy, and several others fell near the Chongqing Hotel, which is where foreign guests stay, only a few feet away. Fortunately, they did not explode, and only two small bombs exploded upon impact. The shrapnel penetrated the walls of the hotel, causing slight damage to the interior furnishings, but all the guests and staff in the hotel took refuge in air raid shelters and were not injured. The remaining bombs fell in rice paddies, causing minimal damage. The third wave of Japanese planes appeared at 1:40 PM, coming from the Jialing River and entering the urban area. The extent of the damage is unknown. The air raid alarm in Chongqing was lifted at 2:40 PM. Afterwards, rumors circulated that the city's power plant had been destroyed, which was denied by the authorities of the plant, who stated that although several power lines in the city had been bombed and destroyed, it would not affect the city's power supply, as the rate of construction in the city was no less than the rate of destruction by the Japanese. After the alarm was lifted, the authorities investigated and found that two Japanese planes had been shot down in the suburbs by Chinese fighter planes. Although the air raid was severe, the residents of the city had learned from the experience of the bombing on May 28 and took shelter appropriately, so the casualties were minimal. Yesterday's air raid coincided with the Dragon Boat Festival. Afterwards, the dragon boat races on the Jialing River proceeded as usual, with thousands of spectators on both banks, still cheerful and spirited, not caring about the air raid an hour earlier. From this, one can see the spirit of the people. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Chongqing. Chongqing was heavily bombed again yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM by 70 Japanese planes. Their target was government agencies outside Tongqing City. However, because the buildings were scattered, although many bombs were dropped, the damage was minimal. Several bombs fell near the German Embassy, causing all the glass windows to shatter. Multiple bombs also fell 20 meters from the Hai Tung News Agency, damaging doors and windows, but fortunately, there were no casualties. Foreign observers believe that the material impact of the Japanese planes bombing Chongqing from 800 kilometers away on such a large scale, aside from psychological impact, is rather small.

<h3>Overseas Chinese Student Registration Procedures Amidst Unified Examination Announcements</h3>
<p>Chongqing.

It is said that a kind of understanding has been reached between the third countries and the Japanese side in the area, stipulating that the relationship between the various third countries in Tianjin will remain unchanged.

<h3>British Foreign Office Issues Common Declaration in Response to Italian Prime Minister's Speech: Italy's Provocation is a Reckless Act, the Consequences Should Be Borne by Mussolini Alone</h3>
<p>London. The British Foreign Office issued the following declaration after Italy notified them of its declaration of war against Britain, France at one minute past midnight last night: "The British people are not surprised by Mussolini's hasty and reckless decision. Mussolini's decision to join the German side has been evident for weeks. The opposition of the majority of Italians to this move is equally obvious to all. Mussolini's decision is based on the most ample material reasons, his motivation is purely driven by the seizure of benefits. Therefore, he chose to join the war at the height of the German aggression against the Allied countries. Mussolini hoped to profit from his erroneous judgment that Germany would win a great victory. The British and French governments have made it clear to Mussolini in recent weeks that if Italy considers there to be any dissatisfaction with its position in the Mediterranean, they are fully prepared to engage in friendly discussions. The only reason for Italy's entry into the war is probably that Mussolini believes that by driving his people into a terrible war, he will gain more. In Mussolini's speech, he first mentioned recent incidents, which are said to be summarized as follows: 'Half-promises, frequent threats, engaging in intimidation, and finally the alliance of encirclement of fifty-two countries.' When Mussolini made this statement, he seemed to forget to mention the agreement signed between Britain and Italy on April 16, 1938. In that agreement, the Italian government stated that all outstanding issues between the two countries had been resolved, the status quo of the Mediterranean had been recognized, and a mechanism for resolving any future disputes had been prepared. This agreement is concrete proof that the British government and people have never wanted to wage war with Italy, believing that there are no major points of conflict between each other that cannot be resolved by peaceful means. The Allied governments have repeatedly stated their willingness to implement this agreement freely signed by Italy and to discuss any opinions between each other. Mussolini now intends to tear up this agreement and plunge his country into war. Therefore, the responsibility for the disasters caused by this war to Italy in the future will be borne by Mussolini alone. From the Unos made by Mussolini not to attack the countries he designated, the people of the world can judge to what extent his policies are purely mechanical and without hesitation. The solemn promises made today will be as unrepentant as when he invaded Denmark and Norway under the official non-aggression promises he considered applicable. Therefore, any country seems to consider any guarantees made in Mussolini's speech tonight to be worthless." (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>Anti-Italian Demonstrations in Various Parts of Britain, Large Numbers of Italian Residents Arrested</h3>
<p>London. Last night, young people in various districts of western Scotland gathered to destroy Italian property, causing significant damage, and many glass windows were shattered by stones. Italian residences in the Greenock district suffered heavy damage. Police used batons to clear the streets. Fifty demonstrators were arrested in various districts and have been punished by the court today. Anti-Italian demonstrations also took place in various parts of England and Wales today. Today, arrests of Italian residents began in various places. Hundreds of idle people crowded in the areas where Italian residents gathered in London, and the streets were sometimes blocked, and the police dispersed them. Italian residents were transported in police vehicles from Soho to a school in western London for detention. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>Two Italian Ships Scuttled Themselves</h3>
<p>London. Yesterday, the crew of the Italian ship "Capo Noli" (3,921 tons), which sailed from Montreal, set fire to themselves in the St. Lawrence River today to avoid being captured. According to the Canadian Ministry of Defense, this attempt by the Italian ship has been prevented by a Canadian minesweeper, which caught up with it 180 miles east of Quebec and captured it. However, two other Italian ships have scuttled themselves today. One is the 6,000-ton cargo ship "Silena," whose crew scuttled themselves in the Bay of Algeciras last night after hearing Mussolini's radio speech. The other is the "New Bivoria," which scuttled itself outside Gibraltar. However, according to Lloyd's Register of World Ships, there is no ship named "New Bivoria." There is only a 5,000-ton ship named "New Media." (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Senate Passes Naval Expansion Bill, House Military Committee Authorizes Authorities to Increase Regular Army to 400,000</h3>
<p>Washington. The Senate recently passed the Naval Expansion Bill and transferred it to the House of Representatives for discussion. Once the decision is made, it will be signed into law by President Roosevelt. According to this bill, the total cost is 650 million U.S. dollars, which will be used to: (1) Increase the naval strength by 11 percent, that is, add 22 warships, totaling 167,000 tons; (2) Increase the total number of naval aircraft to 10,000; (3) Strengthen existing naval and air bases and add new bases, totaling 21 new and old bases. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Washington. The House Military Committee has authorized the authorities to mobilize and increase the regular army from 280,000 to 400,000, and has authorized President Roosevelt to call out the National Guard "for use or training" within the United States during periods when Congress is not in session.

<h3>Shanghai Concessions Remain Neutral After Italy Enters War, Allied Defense Forces Agree to Jointly Maintain Status Quo, French Concession Does Not Discriminate Against Italian Residents</h3>
<p>Since Italy declared war on Britain and France at 6:00 PM the night before last (that is, 3:00 PM Shanghai time), the situation in the city suddenly became tense, as the British and Italian defense forces have formed a confrontational situation in the defense zones of the concessions. However, in order to maintain local security and avoid conflicts between subordinates of both sides when they meet in coffee shops and other public places, the senior authorities of the British and Italian defense forces have issued orders prohibiting their troops from going out. At the same time, the commanders of the defense forces of various countries are also planning that personnel of enemy troops can only visit or move around in designated places. Italian troops are absolutely not allowed to enter the French Concession. It is reported that Commander Park of the U.S. Marine Corps met with the commanders of the defense forces of various countries yesterday morning, including the commanders of the British, French, and Italian defense forces. The French commander and the Italian Marine Corps commander also met yesterday morning after receiving the news of Italy's entry into the war. They agreed to maintain the status quo of the concessions with all their strength. Subsequently, the Italian commander also held talks with Japanese army personnel at the Italian Consulate on Chengdu Road. The discussion also focused on the issue of maintaining the status of the concessions.</p>
<h3>U.S. Will Do Its Best to Maintain the Status Quo</h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. officials in this port expressed their personal views on the situation in the Shanghai concessions after Italy entered the war and the defense force issues of Britain, France, and Italy, saying that the U.S. hopes that the British and French defense forces and the Italian defense force in this port will take peaceful measures and jointly maintain security. The U.S. has rights and interests in Shanghai and will do its best to protect them, cooperate with the defense forces of various countries, and maintain the status quo of the concessions. The Maclane team of the U.S. Marine Corps in the British defense zone in the Public Concession along Jing'an Temple Road and Xinzha Road has slightly strengthened its guard since yesterday morning and has dispatched its patrol teams to patrol its defense zone. It is also learned that the U.S. naval authorities in Shanghai have announced that the naval personnel will not be granted leave of absence and will wait for further orders. At the same time, the U.S. naval authorities are also taking measures to maintain security, which cannot be made public at this time.</p>
<h3>British People Not Allowed to Trade with Italy</h3>
<p>The British Embassy in China in this port has issued a notice restricting all British merchants and people of British descent from trading with Italian merchants, otherwise, they will be punished under the law of trading with the enemy. This is the reaction to Italy's entry into the war in this port. Also, Italian residents who have deposits in British and French banks and French residents who have deposits in Chinese-Italian banks, fearing confiscation, rushed to withdraw their deposits at the management methods, causing the banks to be very busy yesterday. Later, when the residents of the respective countries learned that nothing unexpected had happened, they were all relieved.</p>
<p>British and Italian Defense Zones Not Separated for the Time Being</p>
<p>According to a reporter from the U.S. Marine Corps Headquarters, in order to maintain peace between the hostile armies, special steps are currently being considered. The method is the same as for Chinese Memorial Day. The patrol forces will be increased, and the defense work will be strengthened. However, the U.S. Marine Corps does not intend to send teams to separate the British, Italian, and Shanghai defense zones. Anyone entering the French Concession to visit family members can go directly to their destination, but they cannot visit the streets. It is reported that yesterday afternoon, several sailors were detained by the patrol teams.</p>
<p>British, French, German, and Italian Forces in Shanghai</p>
<p>Military circles believe that rumors of Germany's seizing the concessions are inaccurate. It is said that there are only 220 Italian soldiers stationed in Shanghai, and all their armaments are small and cannot confront the French army. The German side can only concentrate 800 people who have received military training. The French army has a strength of about 2,000 people. The British army has 1,600 people. The U.S. Marine Corps also has no less than 1,600 people. It is said that the defense forces of various countries have agreed to cooperate to maintain the order of the concessions so that the Japanese army cannot use the "unexpected event" as an excuse to enter the concessions. The navies of Britain, France, and Italy currently have warships anchored in the Huangpu River, with three gunboats from the British side and two each from the French and Italian sides. In addition, during the war, the Italian ship Contifordian will remain in Shanghai, while four other Italian ships have sailed to the sealing line in Nanshi to take refuge for the time being. An Italian ship will arrive here from Ningbo tomorrow and will also sail to the Nanshi sealing line and will not resume navigation for the time being.</p>
<p>French Concession Does Not Discriminate Against German Residents</p>
<p>O'Keeffe, the acting Consul General of France in Shanghai, told Chinese and foreign journalists in this port yesterday morning that Italian residents residing in the French Concession who do not engage in political activities will still be allowed to reside in the French Concession. The method is the same as the French Concession's treatment of German residents and will be protected in the same way as other residents. Also, Italian residents in the French Concession yesterday did not receive any notice from the French Concession authorities to move out. There are approximately 600 Italian residents in this port, most of whom live in the French Concession. According to responsible British figures in this port, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has lost his ability to take the initiative, and his foreign policy has been hijacked by Hitler. He has placed Italy under the control of the Nazis. According to the opinions of the British residents, after Italy entered the war, it was completely under the control of the Germans, which is the same as the situation in Italy fifty years ago.</p>
<h3>Japan's Stance on Concessions: No Rash Actions</h3>
<h3>Though Covetous, the Situation Prevents It; America Vigilantly Monitors Japanese Actions</h3>
<p>According to a Westerner familiar with Far Eastern affairs, the Japanese side is indeed quite covetous of the concessions. However, before it alters its policy of "not joining the European war," it will likely not take violent actions to seize the concessions. Whether it will ultimately not join the European war is difficult to say, but not until America loses its ability to be a stabilizing factor in the Pacific will Japan act hastily and bring disaster upon itself. Currently, America's actions to aid Britain and France are becoming increasingly active, and even joining the European war is not entirely impossible. However, we should know that even if America joins the European war, its power in the Pacific will not be diminished. This is because the British and French navies already view Germany and Italy as being at an absolute advantage, and the weakness of their armies lies not in a lack of soldiers, but in insufficient ammunition. America only needs to provide sufficient supplies of airplanes, artillery, and tanks, and to assist with transportation using some of its ships, which is already sufficient. Even if military assistance is unavoidable, those sent to help will mostly be from the army and air force, while the navy will still be able to monitor Japan and maintain control of the Pacific sea lanes, preventing Japan from being trapped by blockades if it participates in the war.</p>
<p>Japanese national strength has been consumed to a considerable extent, as the country's policymakers must know. Considering the American pressure that joining the European war would inevitably bring, they may feel that the future is extremely dangerous and be cautious in their actions. However, this does not mean that Japan will never take risks and further escalate the war, and that the Shanghai concessions are completely safe. Wealthy Chinese people should still think ahead and take precautions, moving inland and investing in various businesses to ensure the safety of their funds.</p>
<p>Italian Official Residence Specially Protected: The French Consul-General, Mr. Auchy, reiterated that rumors of the French Concession authorities ordering all Italian residents in the district to leave the country were completely untrue. He stated that the French Concession authorities were responsible for protecting the safety of the Italian ambassador and other officials, and denied that the French Concession authorities had ordered the Italian flag to be taken down from the Italian ambassador's residence at 118 Kim Shenfu Road yesterday morning. Furthermore, the French Concession authorities dispatched a large number of police officers yesterday morning to guard the Italian ambassador's residence, to prevent any unforeseen events from occurring. However, several Italian military vehicles were parked in front of the Italian ambassador's residence yesterday morning, moving items.</p>
<p>The Italian Consulate is Under Strict Guard: Yesterday, the Italian Consulate at 269 Chengdu Road in this city saw unusually frequent comings and goings of people, and the atmosphere was extremely tense. Two Italian soldiers stood guard at the entrance of the consulate, closely watching those entering and leaving, and questioning them very strictly. Armed personnel were also patrolling inside the consulate. A foreign reporter asked Mr. Tai, a secretary at the Italian consulate, about the Italian government's policy regarding the European war.</p>
<p>He said that during this critical period, he regretted that he could not answer. It is true that the Italian Ambassador, Mr. Gagliani, and his staff have suspended their trip to North China to escape the summer heat, and that Mr. Gastra Pon Lo has recently come to Shanghai to inspect the local diplomatic affairs. However, he would remain silent on other matters and would not express any opinions.</p>
<p>The Conte Verde to Move Anchorage Today: The Italian mail steamer Conte Verde, which was ordered by the Italian government to remain in a neutral port and suspend its return to Europe, was still docked at the Hongkou Gonghexiang Wharf yesterday. Yesterday, it began unloading the goods that had already been loaded and were prepared to be shipped to Hong Kong. These goods weighed about 100 tons. It is expected that it will be moved to a different anchorage today. According to company staff, if buoys number one and two are not available, it will be moved to buoys number thirteen and fourteen. If it cannot be berthed there for an extended period, it will be moved to Wusong, depending on the circumstances at the time.</p>
<p>Italian Merchant Ships Continue to Sail: With Italy's official entry into the war, the future voyages of the Italian merchant ships operating in China have become a matter of great concern. According to inquiries made by a reporter from the New Voice News Agency yesterday at various Italian merchant shipping companies, none of the companies had received any orders from the Italian consulate as of yesterday. The ships of the Sino-Italian Company, with the exception of the Deping, which is currently in Zhenhai, are all undergoing annual repairs in shipyards. The Changde of the Rocchi Shipping Company recently returned to Shanghai from Ningbo and is temporarily suspending a voyage due to boiler cleaning. The Shili of the Italian-China Shipping Company is expected to arrive in Shanghai from Wenzhou tomorrow. The company said that it has not yet decided when it will resume sailing. There are also several other Italian ships chartered by merchants to operate to North China and Wenzhou, and they are all prepared to continue sailing according to their original schedules.</p>
<h3>Japan Barefacedly Seeks Peace</h3>
<h3>But Still Acts Arrogantly; In Reality, Peace is Not Difficult; Japan Only Needs to Withdraw All Troops from China</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese army invaded China three years ago, they have achieved nothing despite their aging troops and demoralized soldiers. Realizing that they cannot conquer China by force, and having no face to show to their own people, they are spreading peace rumors in desperation, hoping to ease the minds of their people. As a result, rumors are flying in the market, claiming that either the British and French ambassadors have urged the Chinese government to negotiate peace, or that the Chinese government has entrusted the German ambassador to mediate. However, all of these claims have been solemnly denied by relevant parties, and dismissed as baseless. According to foreign reports yesterday, a spokesman for the Japanese ambassador stated at a press conference that Japan does indeed wish to make peace with China, but denied spreading peace rumors. According to the spokesman, Japan's desired conditions for peace with China are that the military and the National Government cooperate with a certain party. However, when the Chinese side stated that there can be peace only if the Japanese army withdraws completely from China, the spokesman considered it "laughable." This is because, according to the spokesman, Japan still considers itself to be the victor.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Rise Again:</h3>
<h3>Orders Placed for Tribute Rice; Quantity Approximately 50,000 Bags</h3>
<p>In view of the rising rice prices, the fact that the early rice crop will not be harvested for some time, and the severe drought plaguing rice-producing areas in the country, various rice merchants in the city believe that if they do not promptly seek to increase rice reserves, they will be manipulated again, which would affect the livelihoods of ordinary people and the security of the entire concession. Therefore, in order to prepare for the worst, they have agreed to entrust foreign companies such as Defu (French), Heyi (British), and Fujia (Swiss) to telegraph Saigon and order a large quantity of tribute rice for storage. The quantity is said to be approximately 50,000 bags. All sectors of the city hope that the concession authorities will strictly set standard market prices, and that the Shanghai Rice Price Stabilization Committee will handle the sale of tribute rice at stable prices as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>US Cruiser Marblehead</h3>
<h3>Arrives in Shanghai for Relief; Augusta Leaves Shanghai; Admiral Hepburn Accompanies</h3>
<p>According to the English-language North China Daily Mail, the US Asiatic Fleet cruiser Marblehead arrived in Shanghai this morning (the 11th) from Manila, mooring at the US naval buoy, replacing the US flagship Augusta, which left Shanghai yesterday (the 10th). Admiral Hepburn, commander of the Asiatic Fleet, departed on the Augusta yesterday, and Admiral Hepburn's personal yacht, Issaquah, also sailed with the Augusta. It is said that the Marblehead will remain in Shanghai for the summer and will not follow the usual practice of sailing to North China this summer.</p>
<h3>Gold Falls;</h3>
<h3>Black Market Exchange Rate Loosens; Prices of All Commodities to Plunge</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the financial market in this city was also affected by speculation about Italy's war situation, causing the price of cash gold to plummet by 380 yuan, closing at 5,180 yuan. The black market exchange rates for British and American currency also eased sharply, with the British exchange rate breaking the four-pence mark to 4.01875 pence, and the American exchange rate also breaking the six-yuan mark to 6.01875 yuan. American dollar bills even plummeted to 16.05 yuan, once falling to 16 yuan and then to 15.9 yuan. Commodity prices in the city also fell sharply as a result. Coal ball prices fell from 142 yuan per ton to 134 yuan, and the price per dan also fell from 7.7 yuan to 7.2 yuan. However, some coal merchants are still trying to raise prices, so some are selling at 7.4 yuan, and the market price is not uniform. It is said that prices will continue to fall today. The price of white newsprint has also fallen to 36 yuan per ream. According to those familiar with the commercial situation, the prices of all commodities are likely to continue to plunge.</p>
<h3>Norwegian Consulate in Shanghai Receives Telegram from London:</h3>
<h3>Norway's National Policy Remains Unchanged: Will Assist Allied Forces in Other Ways</h3>
<p>After the news that General Fleischer, commander of the Norwegian Sixth Army, had signed an armistice agreement with Germany, and that the Norwegian King had ordered the Norwegian army to cease resistance on Norwegian soil, the Norwegian Consulate in Shanghai received a telegram from the Norwegian Embassy in London yesterday afternoon, confirming that the Norwegian army in the heavily guarded areas had ceased military resistance against the German army. King Haakon VI and important members of the Norwegian government have now retreated from northern cities to Britain with the Allied forces. The telegram also announced that Norway's established policy will not change and that it will continue to assist the Allied forces in other ways. The Norwegian government has also been reorganized and established within British territory. Furthermore, a spokesperson for the consulate stated that this armistice was purely to avoid unnecessary sacrifices and was not a surrender.</p>
<h3>Dutch East Indies</h3>
<h3>Confiscates German Assets</h3>
<h3>Several German Ships and Cargoes Seized; Extremely Strict to Prevent Fifth Column Activities</h3>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, Mr. Xu, a foreigner, recently returned to Shanghai from Batavia in the Dutch East Indies. According to him, the Dutch East Indies authorities took swift action to prevent possible riots by the German "Fifth Column." After receiving news of German residents in the Netherlands, the police immediately took action to arrest all German merchants and those suspected of sympathizing with the German side, including members of the Dutch Fascist movement. German assets and investments, as well as real estate worth 40 million Dutch guilders, were all confiscated. Several German ships anchored in the Dutch East Indies, along with their cargoes worth 300 million Dutch guilders, were also seized. It is estimated that the losses suffered by Germans in the archipelago will exceed 500 million Dutch guilders. After the Netherlands surrendered, the residents of the Dutch East Indies worked very hard, with some working in shifts day and night. When Mr. Xu was in Batavia, he met a sailor who had seized a German ship in the port. The sailor said that the German crew had attempted to scuttle three German ships but failed. It was later discovered that the German crew had planned to scuttle the ships as soon as the Dutch authorities seized them, but they did not have time to carry out the plan. The oil, tin, and rubber on board were all confiscated, and the ships were repainted and used to transport supplies for the Allied forces. The indigenous residents of the Dutch East Indies have all expressed their loyalty to Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands. The entire policy of the archipelago's government is not only aimed at benefiting the Netherlands, but also at benefiting the whole world, so it gives equal rights and opportunities to all countries.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Arrives in Ningbo</h3>
<h3>Japan Still Prevents Shipment</h3>
<h3>Famine Victims in Shanxi Call for Help</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai held a fundraising conference to relieve the famine in their hometown, and the first result was very satisfactory, with donations and subscriptions totaling more than 1.08 million yuan. The association has scheduled a second fundraising conference for 5 pm on the 22nd, aiming to raise another 2 million yuan. According to a telegram received by the association from Ningbo, the Ningbo Food Supply and Marketing Company, in view of the shortage of food rice in Ningbo and the depletion of food rice in various parts of Taiwan, has specially sent representatives to Shanghai to jointly purchase foreign rice from Hong Kong and Saigon. The first batch of rice from Hong Kong has already been transported to Zhenhai by the Grand Wheel, totaling more than 18,000 bags. The second batch of about 10,000 stones will arrive in Ningbo around the 20th, and the third batch of 40,000 stones will arrive by the end of the month. In order to restrict purchases, the Food Relief Association will start selling rice from 6 am every day from the 11th, limiting each person to one dou at a price of 5 cents per dou, and has designated the following rice shops to sell: Jiangdong Muxing Lane Dashun Rice Mill, Xinpu Street Shang Lao Yuxing Rice Shop, Jiangbei An Waitan Xinhuo Rice Shop, Xianning Street Chen Wanshun Rice Shop, Dongdu Road Qianyi Rice Shop, Xida Zha Wufengxiang Rice Shop, Sanbanqiao Lane Donghoumao Rice Shop, and Beida Road Zhaokang Rice Shop. However, purchases of food rice by the military government's charitable organizations will be specially subsidized by the Yin County government.</p>
<p>Ruital to Set Sail: The Ruital, a direct line passenger ship of the Huaxun Shipping Company on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, arrived at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou on the morning of the 10th and loaded 2,000 bags of Zhen Rice for shipment to Ningbo for relief. It was unreasonably obstructed by the Japanese naval military police. After the company's manager tried his best to communicate with the Japanese side, he was unable to get results until noon. The ship then returned to the wharf at 14 Beijing Road and set sail for Ningbo at 6 pm yesterday after loading passengers.</p>
<p>Famine Victims Appeal: The Shanghai Shanxi Guild Hall yesterday issued an urgent appeal: "The population of the old Shanyin and Kuaiji counties in Shaoxing totals 1.2 million. Since the 813 Incident, they have only relied on rice relief from Shangrao in Jiangxi and Jinhua. Since Xiaoshan in eastern Zhejiang fell, the army has been stationed, and the demand for food rice has increased. However, the rice purchased by merchants cannot be transported to Shaoxing for relief due to control and transportation vehicle issues. The price has soared from 40-50 yuan to 70-80 yuan per stone, and now it has skyrocketed to 117 yuan. The authorities are simply searching villagers for 10-20 stones of food rice, confiscating it, arresting people, and imposing fines. They have no plan to relieve the famine, and they are only harassing the people. Without fundamental solutions, the situation is dire. Recently, Shanghai newspapers reported on the Shaoxing natives in Shanghai transporting rice for relief, which refers to Yuyao and Shangyu counties. The Shaoxing County of Shanyin and Kuaiji is still in dire straits and in urgent need of relief."</p>

<h3>Taikoo Dockyard Labor Strike Resolved:</h3>
<h3>Company Further Increases Wages to Two Yuan Per Worker</h3>
<p>The stevedores of the British Taikoo Dockyard went on strike last week after their demand for a wage increase was unsuccessful. The strike has lasted for six days. Although the foreman and worker representatives have been negotiating constantly, the company insisted on the terms of the February 10 agreement, while the workers refused to work for anything less than two yuan per worker. Both sides were at extreme ends, and a solution could not be found for a time. Various media outlets have reported on this. Since the workers went on strike, goods on various ships could not be loaded or unloaded, and they could not be exported. Ship schedules were delayed, and the company suffered considerable losses. As a result, the company's attitude suddenly changed yesterday morning.</p>
<p>The foreman was informed that the company would allow an 80% wage increase, with the foreman subsidizing the small difference. The foreman reluctantly agreed to the subsidy after being informed, and then convened a meeting of worker representatives. The workers expressed satisfaction with the acknowledgment of a two-yuan wage per worker. The foreman then ordered them to work, but the workers felt that the negotiations had been successful and held a victory rally in Pudong today to celebrate, and paraded at the Taikoo Wharf in Yangjiadu, Pudong. It was decided to resume work this morning.</p>
<p>The foreman and worker representatives also signed a new agreement yesterday to ensure good faith. The Jinan and Suzhou, which had arrived some days ago, returned to anchorage outside the Wusongkou to await the resolution of the labor strike. It is expected that the two ships can also enter the port today, dock at the wharf, and unload their cargo. A total of five ships belonging to the company arrived during this labor strike. In addition to the New Beijing, which came from abroad, the other four ships, Qiongzhou, Yingzhou, Jinan, and Suzhou, came to Shanghai from South China, carrying a large batch of foreign rice totaling more than 45,800 bags, which can be unloaded after work resumes.</p>
<h3>All Industries Pay National Taxes According to Law:</h3>
<h3>Authorities Express Appreciation: Stamps Out of Stock; Hope for Prompt Shipment to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Although Shanghai has become an isolated island, all industries are deeply aware of their responsibilities and continue to pay various taxes and levies according to law. The government authorities deeply appreciate this. In the past, such as with stamp tax, businesses have consistently affixed stamps after the withdrawal of the national army. Although they are temporarily out of stock recently, businesses are eagerly awaiting the early arrival of stamps in Shanghai, so that they can continue to affix them as usual and fulfill their national taxpaying responsibility, demonstrating their enthusiasm for national affairs. Recently, in order to reward patriotism and facilitate tax payments, the financial authorities have stipulated that all businesses and organizations in Shanghai can pay the taxes they owe in any part of the interior, and that branches should also pay in the interior, to ensure safety. It has been reported earlier that it is expected that all industries will be more enthusiastic about paying taxes with this convenience.</p>

<h3>Proprietors of Bailey Gauze Shop and Others:</h3>
<h3>Forging Freight Waybills: Impersonating Shenxin Factory Products to Defraud: Arrested Together; Case is Very Complex</h3>
<p>Wang Xianglin, a Ningbo native and proprietor of the Bailey Gauze Shop in Room 108, Harry Building, 233 Nanjing Road; Wang Zhengfu, manager; accomplices Wang Jianzhang and Zhang Desheng, a local who formerly served as a Chinese detective in the Public Concession; and Ningbo native Dai Xianfang and Shaoxing native Sun Xinian were arrested one after another by Chinese Chief Detective Yao Yuanlong, Detective Ni Jiafeng, and Western Detective Green of the Jing'an Temple Police Station for allegedly forging "Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui Tax Bureau" freight waybills, impersonating Shenxin Power Factory products, and defrauding others through intimidation. Hundreds of genuine transportation documents were seized at the Bailey Gauze Shop, worth 4,039 yuan in legal tender, and 387 counterfeit transportation documents and four books, as well as four seals, were seized at Zhang Desheng's residence at 279 Hede Road and Sun Xinian's residence at 860 Beijing Road. Subsequently, detectives from the French Concession Police went to Wang's house at 13 Lane 189, West Zilaihuo Street, and seized a zinc plate for the counterfeit transportation documents and a "Unified Tax Bureau" seal, all of which were taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Mr. Li Zhishan, the police station's lawyer, stood up and presented the case, stating that the case was reported by Feng Nanyi, a representative of Shenxin No. 9 Factory, who said that the factory's name was being used on silk cloth transportation documents, but the goods listed on the documents were not products of the factory, and it was actually a case of changing the appearance of the goods, which affected the factory's business. Based on the report, the police station cracked the case. It was found that Zhang Desheng, one of the defendants, was a former police officer who was arrested last year for committing a crime and sentenced to one year and six months in prison, with a four-year suspended sentence. Dai Xianfang and Sun Xinian were also sentenced to six months in prison, with a three-year suspended sentence. Because the case is complex, he requested permission for detention. Judge Liu approved a seven-day detention for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Conspiring to Embezzle Public Funds:</h3>
<h3>Faking a Robbery Fails: Zhu Rongting, Yao Huachun, and Others Arrested</h3>
<p>Zhu Rongting, a native of Suzhou, was employed as a clerk at Xie Xing Yuan Money Shop, 429 Jiujiang Road. On the 8th of this month, Zhu was ordered by the shop owner to withdraw 5,145 yuan from the Shanghai Bank and Dingkang Money Shop to purchase US dollar drafts at Fuyuan Money Shop in Ruyi Lane, Henan Road. However, Zhu had malicious intentions and colluded with Yao Huachun, Chen Xiangsheng, Li Yongde, and Li Shunnan, all natives of Suzhou. After withdrawing the money, Zhu deposited 2,000 yuan of it with Chen Qixiang, a clerk at Rongzhang Silk Shop, 18 Xiangfen Lane, while the remainder was distributed among Yao and others. However, to avoid being caught, Li and Chen pretended to be robbers and, together with Zhu, went to the entrance of Lane 10 near Sichuan Road, Ningbo Road, and staged a robbery. Zhu loudly called for the police, claiming that more than 5,000 yuan had been robbed. The police took Zhu to the Central Police Station to report the incident, and Chinese Detective Cheng Renkun investigated. Because the location and time Zhu mentioned were suspicious, he tried his best to investigate and exposed the fraud. Yao and the other four were arrested one after another in Room 602 of the Da Hu Hotel on Aiduya Road. At the time, Yao and the others were drinking beer and having fun with prostitutes in the room. They were taken back to the police station along with the 4,090 yuan of stolen goods. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, requested detention and asked for separate lawsuits after investigating the criminal responsibility of each defendant.

<h3>Jiangsu Middle Schools in Shanghai Enrolling Transfer Students in the Third Grade: Joint Examinations Scheduled by Each School for Students Who Have Lost Their Schooling in Occupied Areas</h3>
<p>Enrolling transfer students in the third grade of senior high school and the third grade of junior high school was rarely permitted under pre-war education regulations. After the war, due to special circumstances, some flexibility has been allowed. Last year, some schools enrolled transfer students in the third grades of senior and junior high school. However, there were often problems with students skipping grades during transfers between schools. It is heard that the Jiangsu Provincial Education Administration, in order to improve student levels and prevent abuses, has stipulated a joint examination method for senior and junior high school third-grade transfer students at Jiangsu Provincial middle schools resuming classes in Shanghai during the summer vacation. As a general principle, third-grade transfer students will not be accepted into the senior and junior high school classes of the 29th academic year. In order to assist students who have lost their schooling in occupied areas, or to fill minimum enrollment quotas, the qualifications for applying to senior and junior high school third-grade transfer classes at each school are that applicants must have completed the coursework for the second grade of senior or junior high school with passing grades, and have verifiable documentation, a resume, and a photograph. Only applicants who pass the review will be allowed to take the examination. Registration will be at each individual school, and the examinations will be held at a designated provincial school in two phases (the first time on July 22nd and 23rd, the second time on August 27th and 28th). The examination subjects for senior high school third grade are Civics, Chinese, English, Mathematics (Solid Geometry, Advanced Algebra, Trigonometry), Physics or Chemistry (chosen by the examinee), History and Geography. The examination subjects for junior high school third grade are Civics, Chinese, English, Arithmetic, Algebra, Physics or Chemistry (chosen by the examinee), History and Geography. Schools that enroll senior or junior high school third-grade students should jointly form a senior or junior high school joint admissions committee, with three people mutually selected as directors to oversee the examination.</p>

Nanhua and China then took the stage. The entire Nanhua team made their debut yesterday, attracting attention from all sides.</p>
<p>In the first inning, Nanhua’s first batter, Ma Shiwei, and Ma Naiguang successively reached first base, followed by Shi Jiakuan and Bao Wenpei, each getting a hit to first base. The advance troops were so sharp, that the Chinese team's morale was thrown into disarray. Nanhua’s Ma, Shi, and Bao returned to base one after another, scoring three runs. The Chinese team used all their strength to end the offensive by Ye Yeqing, Chen Guangye, and Xia Weibin.</p>
<p>When it was China's turn to attack, the umpire Zha Shi (from Min Diannu, second base) bore a grudge because the Min team was overwhelmed by the Hong Kong Club the other day, and Lin Ye was the umpire. So when Lin Ye was waiting for the ball, he repeatedly called "strike." Bao Wenpei took advantage of this and struck out Lin Ye with three strikes. Chen Lianliang and Chen Fangxuan were also dismissed, and the whole situation collapsed. China got nothing, and Nanhua led 3-0.</p>
<p>In the second inning, Nanhua made a big mistake. Four up and three down, they ended with zero points. When it was China's turn to counterattack, all the members did not dare to slacken, and did their best, scoring fifteen consecutive points before coming to a halt. Since then, Nanhua fell into a slump. By the fifth inning, both sides agreed to score based on the five innings. China won 18-3.</p>

<h3>Finance The Impact of Italy's Entry into the War: Foreign Exchange Sellers Arrive in Succession</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) announce its rates at 9:30 AM. The British pound remained stable, while the US dollar was pegged at a tight 25. Other currencies, such as the Japanese yen and German mark, also experienced a slight weakening. Regarding the domestic market, the news of Italy's declaration of war in Europe caused widespread unease, leading to a surge in selling. Throughout the day, in addition to aggressive selling by Chinese speculators, Hong Kong's Lei Hing and Japan's Bank, as well as the Yu Lee Bank, were all keen to sell. Consequently, the morning saw the British pound fall to 4 pence, with the US dollar initially reaching 6.0625 yuan and further weakening to 6.25 yuan in later trading. Before the evening close, rumors of tension in Paris circulated, prompting market participants to adopt a wait-and-see approach to buying and selling, resulting in extreme market volatility. Ultimately, the British pound closed at 4 pence 0.0625, and the US dollar closed at 6.1875 yuan, showing an increase of 2.1875 for the British pound and a decrease of 3.4375 for the US dollar compared to before the holiday. The futures market mirrored the weakness in the spot market.</p>
<p>Market Sentiment Is Uneasy</p>
<p>The morning began with the London Telegraph's reporting of a near-term drop of 37.5 and a far-term rise of 1.875. New York silver prices remained unchanged, and London raw materials were stable. Exchange rates showed no change for the British pound against the US dollar, a decrease of 0.0625 against Shanghai, no change against the French franc, a decrease of 3 cents for the US dollar against the British pound, a decrease of 5.5 cents against Shanghai, and a small decrease of 1.5 cents against the French franc. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. Banks opened the spot selling prices in the morning, with the British pound at 3 pence 0.875 and the US dollar at 5.6875 yuan. Compared to before the holiday, the British pound saw a slight decrease of 0.03125, while the US dollar experienced a sharp increase of 1.5625, primarily due to the significant drop in exchange rates. The market remained volatile after the opening, largely influenced by Italy's formal declaration of war in Europe, which weakened market sentiment. Chinese speculators were predominantly sellers, with little buying interest. Initially, foreign firms absorbed June US dollar contracts from 5.6875 yuan to 5.9375 yuan, showing a firm trend. Later, American banks and foreign firms settled spot US dollar transactions at 5.875 yuan. When the HSBC rates were announced, the British pound remained unchanged, while the US dollar was firm at 25. Subsequently, Hong Kong Telegraph also offered sales, but Chinese speculators continued to sell. Hong Kong Telegraph sold spot British pounds to HSBC at 4 pence, and foreign firms acquired June US dollar contracts from speculators at 6 yuan and 6.03125 yuan. Yu Lee Bank also sold June US dollar contracts to foreign firms at 6 yuan. As noon approached, Japanese banks and others offered sales, causing the market to weaken. June US dollar contracts reached a firm 6.0625 yuan, and Chinese speculators sold spot US dollars to American banks, consistently priced at 6.00625 yuan. As a result, the British pound closed at 4 pence 7.03125, and the US dollar closed at 6.0625 yuan. The June contracts were priced the same as the spot market, while the July contracts were priced at 3 pence 9.375 for the British pound and 5.90625 yuan for the US dollar, showing a decrease of 1.5625 for the British pound and an increase of 3.75 for the US dollar compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>US Dollar Weakens to 6.115 Yuan</p>
<p>Selling pressure intensified in the afternoon. Initially, Wo sold June US dollar contracts to Sassoon at 6.125 yuan, which helped stabilize the market temporarily. However, speculators remained the primary sellers, offering June US dollar contracts at 6.1875 yuan and selling spot US dollars as low as 6.25 yuan. Ultimately, the market stabilized at the close, with the spot British pound at 4 pence 0.0625 and the US dollar at 6.1875 yuan. The June contracts were priced the same as the spot market, while the July contracts were priced at 3 pence 9.6875 for the British pound and 6 yuan for the US dollar, showing an increase of 2.1875 for both spot and futures British pound and a decrease of 3.4375 for the spot and June US dollar contracts and an increase of 3.125 for the July US dollar contract compared to before the holiday.</p>

<h3>The European Situation Is Unspeakable; Gold Appears Dim and Colorless, Reaching a Low of 5,200 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold spot market experienced a worsening downtrend, with a single-day decline that could be described as drastic. Although there were some fluctuations in the middle, it was difficult to maintain any upward momentum. The primary reason for this was the significant weakening of the foreign exchange market, driven by the ongoing developments in Europe and Italy's declaration of war. This situation instilled fear in market participants, who believed that long positions offered more losses than gains. Consequently, there was a growing desire to sell. The market opened relatively stable, slightly down by 50 yuan, opening at 5,600 yuan. Subsequently, money exchange houses bought in, causing a rebound of 50 yuan. However, as the foreign exchange market continued to report tightening, buying interest faded, leading to a decline to 5,370 yuan. The noon close was only 5,380 yuan. The afternoon market opened weak. After a brief uplift, it plunged to a low of 5,200 yuan. At this time, it was rumored that securities firms were actively buying, and it was also rumored that German troops were approaching Paris. Although money exchange houses bought on the cheap before the close, there was only a rebound to 5,280 yuan (and even after the close, the market felt weak, with even a 30 yuan discount on the closing price still difficult to find buyers). This was a massive drop of 370 yuan compared to the previous Saturday. Total trading volume for the day was approximately 4,000 taels. Jewelry gold also experienced a sharp drop of 40 yuan, while customs gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Gold Drops by 370 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially opened steady, with a slight decrease of 50 yuan, driven by reports of Italy's entry into the war, but the black market US dollar tightened due to the sharp decline in the British pound. Gold shops traded 30 taels among themselves at 5,600 yuan. Subsequently, driven by aggressive buying by money exchange houses and silver shops, the price quickly rebounded by 50 yuan. Gold shops sold 20 taels to securities firms for 5,650 yuan. As the foreign exchange market weakened, selling pressure returned, and gold shops and silver shops rushed to sell, while there were very few buyers. Before long, there was a sharp drop of 200 yuan. Yu shops sold 20 taels to securities firms for 5,450 yuan. Later, with securities firms and money exchange houses buying in, the price rebounded by 70 yuan. Money exchange houses traded 30 taels with each other for 5,520 yuan. However, as the foreign exchange market continued to tighten, sellers continued to arrive, causing the market to collapse again, plummeting by 150 yuan. Gold shops sold 50 taels to silver shops for 5,370 yuan. Subsequently, money exchange houses bought 10 taels from gold shops for 5,380 yuan, which served as the noon closing price. When the market opened in the afternoon, market sentiment was even weaker, and the masses competed to sell. Silver shops sold 20 taels to securities firms for only 5,300 yuan. Later, securities firms and gold shops bought in, briefly seeing a rebound of 60 yuan. Securities firms bought 30 taels from gold shops for 5,360 yuan. However, with the foreign exchange market even weaker, and rumors spreading that German troops had reached the outskirts of Paris, sellers gathered. One securities firm aggressively sold, causing a rapid decline of 160 yuan. Gold shops sold 50 taels to silver shops for 5,200 yuan. Subsequently, selling pressure gradually subsided, and gold shops and money exchange houses aggressively bought on the cheap, resulting in a rebound of 150 yuan. Money exchange houses bought 30 taels from gold shops for 5,350 yuan. Later, silver shops and cash gold shops sold, causing another drop of 70 yuan. Silver shops sold 30 taels to gold shops for 5,280 yuan, which served as the evening closing price. As a result, the price fell by 370 yuan compared to the previous Saturday. It has now fallen for three consecutive days, totaling 820 yuan. After the close, the price fell further to 5,260 yuan. Total fluctuations for the day were 450 yuan. Cash gold shops sold their branded gold at a price that was higher than the spot price by a dozen yuan, while they bought it back at a price that was lower by 30 yuan. The current standard gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and trading was scarce.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Drops Frequently by 40 Yuan</p>
<p>At the beginning, major jewelry shops were still listing jewelry gold at 580 yuan per tael. However, at 9:37 AM, it was lowered by 10 yuan. At 9:50 AM, it was lowered by another 10 yuan. At 10:15 AM, it rebounded by 10 yuan. At 11:25 AM, it was lowered by another 10 yuan. At 12:05 PM, it was lowered by another 10 yuan. At 2:30 PM, it was lowered by another ten. There were no further changes after this. As a result, it was lowered by a total of 40 yuan. The major jewelry shops revised their listing to 540 yuan, while the new jewelry shops had the same prices as the previous day. The buy-back price was lower by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Italy Enters the War: Foreign Currencies Plunge</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a sharp decline, as Italy's declaration of war against the Allied nations led to significant changes in the European situation. This caused widespread panic, resulting in a sharp drop of over 300 yuan in spot gold prices. The supply of British and American gold sovereigns was plentiful, and market prices uniformly plunged by 10 yuan. The black market foreign exchange rate weakened significantly, with the British pound breaking through the 4 pence barrier and the US dollar rising above the 6 yuan mark. Selling pressure permeated the market for British and American gold notes, with American gold notes falling to a low of 15.9 yuan in the afternoon before slightly rebounding to 16 yuan in the evening, a sharp drop of 1.3 yuan compared to the previous Saturday. British gold notes closed at a low of 51 yuan. Hong Kong notes followed the downward trend due to the sharp drop in Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rates. In addition, Singapore, rupee, Canadian, and Philippine notes were also in plentiful supply, and market prices uniformly weakened. Japanese gold notes and Korean notes also trended weaker, with the former retreating to 1.09 yuan and the latter falling to 0.93 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities: Foreign Stocks Plunge; Domestic Bonds Also Experience Excitement</h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities market experienced a shift towards a downturn, with strong selling pressure and a weakening trend. This was largely due to the uncertain nature of the Sino-Japanese War, which caused widespread unease. Moreover, the proximity of each upcoming interest payment period raised concerns, preventing the market from rebounding as it traditionally would during a gold price collapse. Although there was talk of peace, it was widely regarded as one-sided propaganda. Rumors in Shanghai were fueled by Italy's entry into the war, further softening market sentiment. In this environment, most investors sought to escape the market, making it difficult to be optimistic about the future. The market opened after a two-day holiday, and selling pressure immediately intensified. After the opening, prices gradually declined. Yih Chang and Lien Yih saw the most active selling, while Lok Mou Hong Tai also engaged in extensive offloading. The 26th and Hong Kong Kang saw some buying, with retail investors absorbing shares in successive waves. Class A shares broke through 61 yuan, Class B shares retreated by 2 yuan, and Class C and E shares both entered the 50 yuan range. There was selling but no buying in Class D shares, preventing them from even opening. The market atmosphere was calmer in the afternoon, but there was still no improvement. Ding Yu Ren Chang bought in, Lok Mou recovered Class B shares, and Lien Ho, Yih Chang, and Tong Kang continued to sell. Buying and selling were relatively balanced. By the end of the day, all shares except for Class D, which failed to open, were slightly down by 0.2 to 0.35 yuan. Total trading volume was approximately 800,000 yuan. A concise summary is provided below.</p>
<p>Stock Transaction: 100 shares of Great China Match Company were traded at a price of 22.5 yuan per share.</p>
<p>Publicly Owned Stock Exchange: Due to Italy's declaration of war, the New York market experienced a sharp decline, causing prices to weaken. In the early afternoon, rumors of Paris falling intensified selling pressure, causing the downtrend to accelerate. As the rumors could not be confirmed, prices partially rebounded. Ultimately, market sentiment remained volatile, with prices fluctuating unpredictably and lacking sustainability. Jardine Matheson shares opened at 23 yuan (ex-dividend) and fell to a low of 19.1 yuan in the afternoon before closing at 20 yuan. Jardine Matheson shares performed even worse, opening at 33.5 yuan and falling to a low of 27.25 yuan before closing at only 28 yuan. Canton shares opened at 10 yuan and gradually declined to 9.1 yuan before slightly rebounding to 9.35 yuan at the close. China Merchants Steam Navigation shares, which had consistently remained stable in recent days, also fell from an opening price above 8 yuan to 7.78 yuan. Wheelock Marden announced a final dividend of 5 yuan, which greatly disappointed investors. Market expectations were much higher, and the company could have paid a better dividend. However, given the extraordinary circumstances, the company adopted a cautious approach, which should not be criticized. Rubber shares saw very little trading, and prices were generally lower than before the holiday.</p>
<p>London, 10th (Monday) Dispatch: Today's listed prices for various Far East companies on the London Stock Exchange saw only HSBC shares weakening by one pound, with shares registered in England at 77 pounds and shares registered in Hong Kong at 80 pounds. The rest remained unchanged. London, 10th (Monday) Dispatch: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign bonds remained stable, with no changes in the upper and lower tier bonds.</p>
<h3>Staple Foods: Rice Prices Soar Uncontrollably; No. 1 Saigon Reaches 57 Yuan; Chang Bang Qing Geng on the Gray Market Reaches 62 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market was the first trading day after the holiday. After two days of market closure, there was urgent demand for actual sales. With the holiday period over, credit conditions eased, and speculators also sought to become active. At the market opening, inland merchants actively competed for supplies, followed by customers from rural estates, who were not deterred by sellers taking the opportunity to hoard goods and raise prices. They instead stepped up their efforts because the drought season was approaching, and the weather seemed too dry, causing inland prices to be high, making it profitable to transport rice from Shanghai. Furthermore, the decoration of shops in Shanghai and the speculation by market participants caused prices to soar. Both domestic and foreign rice prices jumped by a significant 2-3 yuan. Foreign rice No. 1 Chen Saigon opened at 57 yuan, Huojiao at 55.5 yuan, and Xiaojiao at 53.5 yuan. In the domestic rice market, rumors circulated that Chang Bang Te Qing Geng broke through the 60 yuan mark on the gray market, reaching an unprecedented peak of 62 yuan in Shanghai. Near the market close, inland customers stopped buying, and as gold prices fell and the exchange rate increased, speculators released their profitable goods, and the upward momentum slowed, with prices falling back by 0.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign merchants and rural estates purchased over 5,000 bags of foreign rice yesterday morning, and shops in Shanghai also experienced increased activity after the holiday. Due to the inability to plant domestic rice, buying interest in the market was extremely strong, with customers, hoarders, and merchants competing to buy. The early market saw prices surge by more than 1-2 yuan. At noon, the exchange rate increased by a small margin of 0.5 yuan. In the afternoon, the exchange rate rose again, and several batches of Siam No. 2 rice were quoted at around 59 yuan. A new batch of 500 tons of Saigon No. 2 rice for delivery at the end of June and early July was sold by Renji Foreign Firm to rice merchants at a price of 60 yuan, causing market sentiment to weaken. The evening market was particularly weak. Siam No. 2 returned rice was initially quoted at 60.08 yuan in the early market, then opened at 60.05 yuan. In the evening market, buyers sought to lower the price, and foreign rice prices also fell by 0.5 yuan. Therefore, foreign rice prices initially rose and then fell yesterday, with the result being an increase of more than one yuan, but the closing market showed a weakening trend.</p>
<p>Additionally, it has been reported that four vessels from Taikoo, Qiongzhou, Yingzhou, Jinan, and Suzhou, have transported a total of 45,800 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. This has been reported in this newspaper previously. Due to the dockworkers' strike, the rice could not be unloaded. It is now known that the issue has been resolved, and the foreign rice can be unloaded this morning.</p>
<p>A total of 1,700-1,800 bags of thick and thin geng domestic rice have arrived over the past three days. It is rumored that due to the scarcity of goods and the soaring prices of foreign rice, the owners of the goods were demanding higher prices, and the transaction was not affected by the high prices. Those who needed it were becoming more willing to buy, causing the opening price to reach an unprecedented high. In addition to Chang Bang Te Qing Geng at 62 yuan, other Chang Kun Geng were sold at 61-60 yuan, Qing Si thin rice at 60 yuan, and Nanyang early and late rice also required 58 yuan.</p>
<p>There were no arrivals of glutinous rice yesterday, and the sales market had little appetite for actual sales because the season had passed. However, hoarders absorbed it in large quantities due to the low price, causing the sellers to be determined. The asking prices rose in tandem with foreign rice, with selling prices increasing by 1.5-2 yuan compared to before the holiday. Jin Li Te Yuan was priced at 48-49 yuan, Dan Chang Bai Yuan at around 47.5-47 yuan, and Jiangbei Bai Yuan at 45-46 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Supply Still Limited; Sales More Active After Holiday; New Wheat Arrivals Still Scarce</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market was relatively active, but factories maintained the original price of 13.8 yuan and were unwilling to sell in large quantities. Merchants still did not have sufficient supplies, and merchants from the South Seas slightly increased their purchases. Merchant prices had risen to 16.25 yuan. According to the factory's intention to sell, the factory believed that there were problems with the raw materials, and merchant prices still needed to be raised. Due to the decline in gold prices and the sharp rise in foreign exchange rates, it was difficult for the market to improve. Domestic flour and returned goods, old brands, etc., were maintained in the middle. It was reported that the Green Mountain Deer price required 14.12 yuan, and the selling prices of other brands varied and remained in a state of fluctuation. Additionally, 1,075 bags of flour were transported to Yantai today.</p>
<p>New wheat has been arriving in small quantities in recent days and is mostly related to certain parties. However, there has been no formal transaction in the market. Most of the Japanese factories purchase wheat from the production areas and transport it to Shanghai. Domestic factories have requested to open up sources of wheat, but there is still no practical solution, so the market is waiting quietly.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Declines Again After Holiday</h3>
<p>The yarn market, after the holiday, has returned to weakness, and the decline is even more intense. This is due to Italy's participation in the war, as well as the appreciation of foreign exchange rates and the sharp decline in gold prices. As a result, market sentiment is weak, and selling pressure has increased, causing market prices to trend downward. 20-count Double Horse yarn has once again broken through the 1,100 yuan mark. However, actual demand in the South is still considerable.</p>
<p>In the morning, spot yarn prices initially rose as the US dollar slightly declined, and market sentiment improved. 20-count Double Horse yarn was quoted at over 1,180 yuan. However, in an instant, exchange rates rose, market sentiment loosened, and selling pressure returned, with the opening price appearing at 1,120 yuan, rising slightly to 1,135 yuan. However, rumors circulated in the market thereafter that gold prices had fallen sharply, causing more sellers to emerge, and market prices gradually declined, falling to 1,090 yuan. The market closed at a further small decline of 10-20 yuan. It is estimated that the total trading volume in half a day was 1,415 yuan, with 20-count Double Horse yarn falling by 28 yuan. Today, 142 pieces of yarn were shipped to Ningbo, 288 pieces were shipped to Yantai, and 835 pieces were shipped to Tianjin. A breakdown of the quantities purchased by various merchants is listed below.</p>
<h3>Cotton Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Cotton trading was scarce due to serious European turmoil that frightened the market and an unstable yarn market. This caused manufacturers to be reluctant to accept cotton, and sentiment among those in the industry was even worse. Transactions were at a standstill. Only Shenxin Factory purchased 112 pieces of Da Zhong Ji cotton for 220 yuan, which was delivered to the factory. This price was much lower than in the past.</p>
<p>In other news, New York cotton market prices were lower by 3-5 points due to the pressure on the Allied side, unfavorable news from Europe, and some short-selling in the South. The Indian cotton market remained normal this morning, but the inability to ship previously sold cotton was a serious problem. Since the issue could not be resolved, there were no transactions all day. The expected price was 170, a decrease of 7 rupees compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Fabrics Plummet</h3>
<p>Domestic Fabrics: Yesterday morning, the fabric market was flat. However, as gold prices fell sharply, speculators lowered their prices and competed to sell, causing the market to plummet. Fine cloths and twills fell by 1-1.5 yuan per piece, coarse cloths fell by 0.5-1.5 yuan, and other dyed, printed, and crepe fabrics were also discounted. However, due to the weak market, it was difficult to generate much buying interest even at low prices. Actual sales customers also adopted a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in a significant reduction in the number of transactions. On this street, transactions included over 3,000 pieces of foreign yarn, hemp yarn, corduroy, rubber cloth, white piqué, and satin. Merchants from the Wen and Yong regions purchased 100-odd pieces of coarse cloth, twill, and colored cloth.</p>
<p>Dong Cloth: White cargo Dragon Fine Cloth, a sharp decline, compared to last week's market, a sharp drop of (per piece) 3.5 yuan. In the morning, merchants from Qinhuangdao in the north purchased calico fine cloth, and merchants from Tianjin purchased Dragon Fine Cloth for next month's delivery. Transactions reached more than 500 packages, and the opening market was still good. Dragon spot sales 39.3 yuan, was eventually sold. Eventually, the local market panicked, selling at the same time, step-by-step compressed, to the noon closing price of 36.9 yuan. Later, as gold prices in the spill, the market atmosphere Yisui, the dragon now fell to 35.5 yuan, this month 36.5 yuan, Buji fell to 9 cents 25, medium-sized miscellaneous fine cloth and fine twill no one asked, very few sales.</p>

<p>Yesterday's oil market situation was such that, generally, people's minds turned as they observed the good situation in inland areas, so the prices of various oils increased across the board compared to before the holiday, generally by 1 to 2 yuan. However, buying interest suddenly decreased in the afternoon, and the market situation showed signs of wavering. As a result, there were no transactions, and the overall situation may change.

<h3>The Great Kings in the Qing Huai River</h3>
<p>In the area of Qing Huai, whenever spring and summer arrive, the tide rises and falls, and great kings appear in the river. These great kings resemble snakes in body but have square heads, with faint glimpses of two horns. They are all incarnations of the river gods. Those experienced in river works can usually name them, saying, "Great King So-and-so, Great King So-and-so." Therefore, when a great king appears, it must be reported to the grain transport commander, who then personally goes to the riverbank to guide it in with a tray. He then uses the sedan chair used by the grain transport commander to send it to the local Great King Temple, setting up an incense table and offering sacrifices. All the river works officials go to the temple to participate in the sacrifice according to their rank. The great kings like to watch plays, so they immediately have actors perform for them. The performances must continue until the great king leaves on his own accord. Because when a great king comes to this place, if there is a dangerous river project, the great king will be able to protect it. Therefore, they have repeatedly been honored by our dynasty with titles, and their reputation is glorious. However, they only appear when the water is high, and even then, only one or two appear, not in an endless stream. Yesterday, it was heard that more than ten great kings suddenly appeared in the office of the grain transport commander, arranged in a tray on the hall, and were then taken up by the grain transport commander with a tray and sent to the Great King Temple, where plays were performed as before, respectfully responding to the gods' grace. Unexpectedly, they have been coming and going continuously, for about ten days. Now, the grain transport commander has ordered the opera troupe to perform plays day and night. In a few days, several more great kings successively arrived, and it is now said that there are more than twenty in total. When the local people heard of this, they all marveled! Some said, "This year we should be prepared for floods." Then, the coming of the great kings is probably to make those who handle river works prepare methods for dredging and guiding the water?</p>

<h3>The "Responsibility" of "Safety"</h3>
<p>— A Senior</p>
<p>The Public Concession will implement Safety Week starting on the 17th. Over nine hundred students in this city will, as in the past year, cooperate to promote this movement, supplemented by drawings and various forms of publicity. Its effect may create a new "safety" record. However, I still stubbornly hold to my opinion: the "Safety Movement" is indeed a cooperation between pedestrians and drivers, but the responsibility of the drivers is even greater.</p>
<p>A tragic case that occurred on Route 10 bus number 15032 can serve as the most powerful example. The occurrence of this tragedy was because Chen Afa's wife, Ms. Lu, "was climbing onto the copper bar when the bus unexpectedly started moving, traveling a distance of twenty feet. Ms. Lu, unable to hold on, let go and fell, resulting in her head being run over by the rear wheel, causing instant death."</p>
<p>At the beginning of the trial of this assault case, a dispute arose between the ticket seller and the driver over the "ringing the bell." In fact, regardless of whether the bell was rung first or the car was started first, neither party can shirk responsibility. "The bus unexpectedly started moving, traveling a distance of twenty feet" has already judged the guilt of both parties. Even if the ticket seller had not rung the bell, wouldn't they have seen someone hanging on the copper bar during the twenty feet of travel? The company's regulations state, "Ring twice to start, ring once to stop." Between two and one, it proves that if an unfortunate incident occurs, saving the time of ringing one less time could have accelerated the rescue. But now, it is "about twenty feet of travel." What other exculpatory evidence can you offer?</p>
<p>As for pedestrians who risk crossing between rows of trams and cars, or those who race with cars and trams, that is naturally their own fault. However, those who "bring it upon themselves" are ultimately in the minority.</p>
<p>Finally, I will conclude with the conclusion of my article "Expanding the Safety Movement": The "Safety Movement" is not a "fun fair," and driving is not a simple mechanical task.</p>
<h3>Dog</h3>
<p>— Lu Ming</p>
<p>Not long ago, the boss bought a puppy. Thus, we, who live in the monotonous sound of machines all day long, regarded it as a novel object. During our spare time after work, everyone liked to crouch down and tease the puppy.</p>
<p>Indeed, this is an endearing little animal, born with pure white soft fur, jumping and frolicking all day long, lively and lovely. The boss also loved it like a precious pearl, never without it coming in and out. The boss once proudly said to the public: "I bought it to relieve boredom!"</p>
<p>However, who would have thought that for the sake of this puppy, some extra work and abuse would be added to our already exhausted lives? For example, every time after dragging our exhausted bodies down from the huge machines, we would have to do chores such as bathing the puppy and buying beef. Sometimes we even had to take the puppy out for a walk. In short, like a master, we had to serve it calmly.</p>
<p>Sometimes the boss would hold the puppy in his arms and tease it. If he was in a good mood, he would stretch his voice and shout for Ah San to buy beef; if Ah San was a little slow, the boss would scold him unceremoniously: "Damn it! Lazybones!"</p>
<p>Ah San only pouted his lips and muttered: "Damn, I'm not even as good as a dog!"</p>
<p>Once, Ah San inadvertently stepped on the dog's tail, and the puppy whined and cried. The boss slammed the table and scolded everyone. From then on, as long as the dog barked outside, the boss would also shout strangely across the window sill: "You have to be careful! Dog-like!"</p>
<p>But one day, unfortunately, something bad happened after all, and that was the puppy went missing. This day, the boss was really anxious. Sweat rolled down his round face, and his eyes were full of red streaks. He used all kinds of obscene abuse on us, seemingly with the intention of swallowing us in one gulp. Helplessly, Ah San and I tremblingly went outside to look for it separately. As a result, the dog was found, originally dozing in a pile of debris. Then a heavy weight seemed to be lifted from our hearts.</p>
<p>Therefore, the boss and the dog became the two major demons in our dark lives. Whenever we were sad and indignant, an unconscious concept would quickly flash through our minds: "Why doesn't God turn us into a dog?" Indeed, our life is not as good as a dog's! We labor continuously from morning till night, but what is the reward? Our puppy would smell the rice without meat and walk away.</p>
<p>But a familiar voice rang in our ears again: "Because we are not dogs, we cannot live that dog-like enjoyable life; to be a person, one should use one's own hands to overcome all difficulties! As the saying goes: No pain, no gain. As long as we constantly struggle with the environment, one day the light will come to us."</p>
<p>It is in anticipation of the arrival of the light that I am unswervingly fighting against all difficulties and the environment.</p>
<h3>Handicraft Should Not Be Too Difficult</h3>
<p>— Ling Tong</p>
<p>My younger sister is studying in the second grade of a certain elementary school. Today, she came back from school with a piece of paper in her hand, on which was drawn a chicken. According to her, the teacher ordered everyone to make one out of cardboard, as a handicraft score, to be handed in on Monday. So my work arrived, and I had to prepare the materials for her, but she couldn't start at all. I had already been busy for a long time, and I was still helping her cut, paste, color, string money, and bend the wire. It took me an hour to make it.</p>
<p>Handicraft in school is originally to train children's hands, so that they can use not only their brains. But now, some elementary schools (it can be said that most of them, because the children of neighbors often clamor for their mothers and sisters to do it for them.) order students to do work that they cannot do themselves. The teacher simply says: Hand it in on such and such a day! They don't do it in class, nor do they teach how to do it, they tacitly ask your parents to do it. When it comes time to hand it in, as long as it can be handed in, they don't ask questions, they just mark the score and let it go.</p>
<p>Without considering the students' abilities, and ordering students to do handicrafts that they cannot do themselves, I object, although I admit that doing it for them is my fault.</p>
<p>Hawthorne Case File</p>
<h3>The Homecoming of the Dance Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 1: "A Very Pretty Miss!"</p>
<p>Hawthorne nodded and said, "That's easy to explain. Maybe two men came in last night."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou was surprised: "Two people? That's troublesome!"</p>
<p>Hawthorne said lightly: "The overlapping male shoe prints are of different sizes, obviously belonging to two people. Bao Lang, you'd better trace these two lines of footprints with paper, designate the deeper line as A, and the shallower line as B." He handed the supplies to me.</p>
<p>I followed the drawing of the footprints, and Ni Jinshou also accompanied me in measuring with a soft ruler. Hawthorne looked towards the stairs at the back and then went into the doorway on the left. After I finished drawing the prints, I felt that Hawthorne's vision was indeed good. Print A was 11.6 inches, and Print B was 10.4 inches, which were obviously different. Not only was Print B shallower, but the prints were mixed up with each other, not as clearly distinguished as Print A. For example, in the western entrance and the space in the middle, there were also a few faint departing Print B's. Then Ni Jinshou and I walked towards the doorway inside.</p>
<p>The room on the left was a reception room and study, very spacious. As soon as Ni Jinshou and I walked to the doorway, a horrible sight came into view. This was the location of the incident.</p>
<p>The center of the horrible sight was naturally the murdered retired dance queen, Wang Lilan. She was sitting on a straight-backed leather cushion chair in front of the desk by the window. Her sitting posture was facing the window, but her head was resting on the back of the chair, and her face seemed to be looking at the ceiling above, as if a philosopher had suddenly discovered a new concept for the mystery of the universe, concentrating on thinking, and becoming wooden for a while.

<h3>The Ideal Lover in the Eyes of Movie Fans - A Wife and Mother Type of Woman</h3>
<p>It is not a novel thing for Hollywood actresses to receive marriage proposals from movie fans. However, according to a statistic of these letters, the actress who receives the most marriage proposals is not those charming girls, but a graceful, middle-aged woman, she is Spring Byington, who played Joan's mother in "You'll Find Out." In the past fourteen months, she has received an average of more than one hundred and ten marriage proposals per month, three times more than any other actress.</p>
<p>According to Ms. Spring, "I am certainly proud to receive so many marriage proposals, but I believe that most of the people who write marriage proposals are motivated by ideals, and what they love is not the 'woman,' but rather..." The mother in the "Joan" movie series is gentle, obedient to her husband, cooks well, and does not ask her husband for money. "However, although I play Mrs. Joan, I am afraid that I myself am not as talented as Mrs. Joan."</p>
<h3>Talking about the *Three Character Classic* in Peking Opera</h3>
<p>— Kefa</p>
<p>The *Three Character Classic* was a book used to enlighten children in private schools in the past, compiled by the famous Confucian scholar Wang Bohou of the Song Dynasty. There is also a play called *Three Character Classic* in Peking opera, which is a *laosheng* (old male role) *zhenggongxi* (major play), specializing in recitative, the setting is also simple, the compiler of the script is unknown.</p>
<p>The plot tells that under the account of Ji Yu Li Mouzheng, there is Wen Tao "played by *jing*" (painted face role). One day, while he was handling affairs in the hall, a letter came from Luo Zhaowei, the commissioner of Huaibei, which was read by Wen Tao's thousand-household pass officer (played by *chou* clown role). The pass officer received it and asked the flag bearer to read it. The flag bearer said he could not read. Wen Tao said: "As a thousand-household, how can you not even recognize a character? You need to learn!" Wen Tao took the letter, looked at it briefly, and ordered the official to return and tell him to act according to the letter. The official asked for the letter back. Wen Tao said: "This is a confidential matter. You go back first, and a letter will arrive later." After the official left, Wen Tao called the pass officer to the back hall. The two were old friends, and he explained that neither of them could read, but they still did not know what the commissioner's letter was about. First, they wanted to find a literate soldier, but then they thought that they were afraid that the soldiers would know that they could not read, which would make it difficult to convince the public. Wen Tao then wanted to find a secretary, so he ordered the pass officer to find one.</p>
<p>The pass officer was looking for a secretary on the street, when he met Luo Ying (played by a Jiangdong person), who failed the exam and was in Huaibei to see Luo Zhaowei, wanting to collect a hundred poems and unite his genealogy with Luo Ying, who was from the same clan. Luo Ying scolded him for being a fickle villain and changed his name to escape. Passing through this place, his travel expenses ran out, and he made a living by selling his writing. The pass officer asked him, and he told him that he was selling his writing. Ka said, "If you sell your writing, you must know how to write." Luo Ying replied, "If you can't write, what are you selling?" Ka was overjoyed, and then accompanied Luo Yang to the yamen. Luo Ying saw Wen Tao and bowed to salute, but Wen blamed him for his impolite manners, and seeing that his appearance was ordinary, he did not believe that he was literate. So he had Luo Ying explain the *Three Character Classic*. Luo Ying saw his words and deeds, and knew that he was a brave man who did not understand writing, so he agreed casually. His explanation was similar to the "twisted explanation of the *Three Character Classic*" in today's crosstalk. After the explanation, Wen Tao was very happy. He then took out the commissioner's letter, and Luo read it, it was Luo Zhaowei who knew that Luo Yang would pass through here, and ordered Wen Tao to escort him to Huaibei. Luo Ying then falsely claimed that this talent was highly intelligent and had already gone to the Guanzhong area. Wen Tao ordered him to write a reply and went to the back hall for a banquet.</p>
<p>The whole play has only two scenes, the first scene is the *xiaochou* clown officer, then Wen Tao, and then the flag bearer, the second scene is the *laosheng* Luo Ying, the whole play only has four lines of *xipi yuanban* (a type of aria) for Luo Ying, the rest is recitative.</p>
<p>It is said that this play was arranged by Fan Sibao in his early years, and Zhang Shengkui once performed it. Now, except for Ma Lianliang who sang it three times (once at Jixiang, once at Kaiming, and this time at Huangjin), other actors have not performed it.</p>
<h3>Carole Landis's Marital Changes</h3>
<p>— Shawie</p>
<p>Deanna Durbin's seventh new film "It's a Date" will soon be released in Shanghai. In addition to Durbin as the protagonist, there is also Carole Landis who is about to be forgotten.</p>
<p>She—Carole Landis—has been constantly releasing two or three new films in recent years, but her reputation has declined year by year, and even now she has been reduced to a supporting role. If it is said that this is due to the decline in her acting skills, she did not seem to be much better than she is now when she was at her most popular five or six years ago. In just a few years, a person's status can be so different. This is probably what is called "star luck"?</p>
<p>When Landis starred in "One Million B.C.", she was a very popular actress in Hollywood. The company authorities and fans alike attached great importance to her and praised her very much, but now it is completely different. It is really a bit "unbearable to look back on those years."</p>
<p>Not only is her career so unsuccessful, but her marriage is also just like her career. She has been married three times, but each time it has failed. Her first husband was Alan Lane. At that time, she had not yet entered the film industry and was working as a private secretary for a celebrity. Alan met her there. Carole and he got married after knowing each other for a month. This rash marriage soon broke up due to incompatibility of interests.</p>
<p>Her second husband was a very handsome man, but later they broke up again for some unknown reason. After Carole left the handsome man, she devoted herself to the film industry. At that time, she had a romance with the stage actor Armin MacArthur, and they got married, but then they didn't get along and divorced again.</p>
<p>These successive marital changes made her very sad, so she abandoned everything and devoted herself completely to her career—the screen. This was the most painful period for her, and it was also the period when she was most prominent on the screen.</p>
<p>Later, she fell in love again and recognized Lord Ravensdale as her ideal partner, so she married for the fourth time. But not long ago, there were rumors that she was in love with an athlete again. If this continues, her marriage will change again. Alas, where will her home be in the end?</p>
<p>Tales from the Studio</p>
<h3>Qiu Hu's Wife's Name is Luo Meiying</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>The play *Mulberry Garden Encounter*, also known as *Qiu Hu Teases His Wife*, or *Horseshoe Gold*, is often performed by Peking opera troupes. The whole play is sung in the *xipi* tune. Qiu Hu's wife is called Ms. Luo. Bangzi troupes perform this play with minor differences, and the *dan* female role refers to herself as Ms. Bai, which is unknown. At the end of the reunion scene, the *dan* female role orders Qiu Hu to kneel on the ground and speaks a long passage, enumerating his crimes of being unfaithful, unfilial, unbenevolent, and unjust, which is not found in Peking opera troupes. Yesterday, I re-read the Yuan Dynasty zaju, *Lu Dafu Qiu Hu Teases His Wife* written by Shi Junbao, which has four acts in total (Yuan Dynasty plays mostly have four acts, one act is equivalent to one scene, the Northern Songs call it *zhe*, the Southern Songs call it *chu*). The first act tells that on the second day of Qiu Hu's marriage, they were having a kinship banquet, Qiu Hu was summoned by the government to be a soldier, and the couple separated. The second act tells that after Qiu Hu left home for ten years, a wealthy household named Li (now people call everyone Li Laoda) planned to marry Qiu Hu's wife, forcing Qiu Hu's parents-in-law to persuade their daughter to remarry, which was scolded by Ms. Luo. This act is not found in the *Mulberry Garden Encounter* of the Jing and Bangzi troupes. The third act tells that Qiu Hu wears a belt and says that he is returning home in glory to visit his mother. From then on (picking mulberries, teasing, apologizing, is roughly the same as Peking opera, and is the basis for Peking opera, so I won't repeat it. However, the Yuan Dynasty songs say that Qiu Hu is from Lujiazhuang, Juye, Lu State, and served as a soldier in Lu State, and was given the title of Zhongdafu for his merits, not going to Chu State to seek officialdom. His wife, Ms. Luo, is named Meiying, not Luofu. According to the last song *Cormorant Sha* in the fourth act of the Peking Opera, it says, "Unlike Qin's Luofu, she only tells the lie of her husband for a while," then the Luofu of the ancient poem, "Luofu has a husband," is Qin Luofu, who is another person who was teased, not Qiu Hu's wife. The lyrics of the *dan* female role in the *Mulberry Garden Encounter* of Peking opera, Peking opera is not as good as Bangzi in writing the situation, and when the corner is teased, she does not scold out powerful words, which is inevitably weak and honest, and does not express the chastity of Ms. Luo. If the Yuan Dynasty's corner's scolding is severe, and there are many words, there are "Qiao men and women" which means dog men and women, there are "disciple children", which means born of a prostitute, there are "that animal", which is easy to understand, no explanation is needed, there are "earth destroys heaven slays," there are "that dead body" scolding seven generations of ancestors, and scolding "eating talents," which is the southern dialect of scolding people "Da Pi" "Sha Pi", the northern dialect of scolding people "Ai Cai", The third act and singing in a paragraph said, song name (three ran), "You see me glance, tattoo your head and face, pull me a pull, cut off your hands and feet, you soup me a soup, break your waist cut bones, grab me a grab, I'll make you suffer exile three thousand miles away, hug me a hug, I'll put you on a wooden donkey at the crossroads, cough, eat the punishment of the criminal law, my father never dug up your family's graves, I never killed your family", no sentence is not evil scolding, no sentence is not wonderful essay, try asking if there are such scolding words in Jing Bang drama?</p>

<h3>Gone With the Wind (4) (i.e. *The Classic of a Chaotic Era*)</h3>
<p>— Yao Senyuan</p>
<p>Two months after the marriage, Frank became ill and was unable to go to the factory to work, so Scarlett went to the office on his behalf. One day she was working in the factory when Rhett Butler came to see her suddenly. At first, she was unwilling to pay attention to him, but then she saw that he was very polite and could lend her money so that she could expand her business, so she accepted his loan. Before he left, they talked a lot of idle talk. She later learned that he had been released because he knew a friend who worked in the government. Not long after, Scarlett returned to Atlanta because she was giving birth. Because there, there was Melanie, who could help her. Later, she gave birth to a girl. After she recovered, she originally wanted to return to the north alone, but then she saw that Ashley and his wife were still living a very hard life, and Ashley was weak and incompetent and could not "get to" work on his own, so she invited him to the north to help her sawmill, because Frank still could not get up to work, and Scarlett very much wanted to be close to Ashley, because she always loved him. Ashley and his wife also had no objection and went to the north with her.</p>
<p>In the north, they all lived a good life, and Frank's illness gradually improved. Ashley and Scarlett were still working in the factory. Rhett was also very good to them, but because he had never been married and had never had the burden of a family, he was still living his wandering life. Sometimes he and Scarlett would meet often, sometimes they might not see each other for a long time and go elsewhere to do his business. But good times don't last long. Suddenly, Frank was shot and killed. The reason was this: Because the north and south had not been unified for a long time, the people still attached great importance to local concepts and were dissatisfied with the current federal government. Therefore, there were political organizations, and Frank and Ashley also joined this society. One day, when they were in a meeting, the government found out and immediately sent troops to arrest them. As a result, Ashley and several other people escaped, while Frank and others died in the chaos of gunfire. Although Ashley was also questioned afterwards, he was eventually acquitted with the help of Rhett.</p>
<p>At this time, the author ended a long novel with very clever writing. She not only distinguished everyone's personality very carefully, but also expressed their personality with very good dialogue. The advantages of this book are too many, so writing a small victory is just to ask readers to find it themselves. And this book is very worthy of reading, and you will not be disappointed after reading it. (End)</p>
