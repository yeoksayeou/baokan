<h3 id="c16">放棄所謂『媚態外交』後之日本 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>日本近衛內閣於上月中旬組成後，本月一日對內外有所公表；據稱事屬日本之國本，且『與統帥府間意見已告完全一致』，本報稱之爲『近衛內閣之基本國策』。與之同時公表者，外務大臣松岡之談話。就所公表，爲抉其有關國際者如次：</p>
<p>『世界現已遭遇歷史之大轉變期，而以多數國家生成潑展爲基調之新政治文化經濟，亦已見其創成。</p>
<p>『鑑於目前內外之新情勢，應以國家總力發揮之國家國防體制爲基礎，充實足以無遺憾以遂行國本之軍備，而現行外交應以東亞之新秩序建設爲根幹，置重點於中國事變之完成。同時，更應達觀國際變局，考慮富有建設性及彈力性之政策，以期國運之進展。</p>
<p>『以皇國爲中心之日滿華三國經濟自主的建設爲基調，確立國防經濟之根基，（一）以日滿華爲一環，確立包含大東亞之協同經濟圈……』</p>
<p>『歷代內閣對其外交方針，曾闡述關於中國事變之處理，對日本持有好意者，與之提携；凡障礙者，予以排除；然此乃在當時之國際情勢中，故僅得言如是。至於現內閣之外交方針，爲貫澈我對外方針，當加以積極的活動；於目下之環境中，得能造成之友邦，予以迭成之。然所謂友邦，當有成功與不成功之別；如向來屢經努力而不克提携之國，今後不再繼作握手之努力。關於不介入方針暫時之間依然堅持之。大東亞共榮圈之確立，首以日滿華爲其根幹；中國事變之處理仍爲主要任務；包含南洋之東亞，固不待言；目的乃在包含日滿華越南荷屬東印度與其他，確立完成自給自足之東亞安定圈。</p>
<p>『新內閣之外交方針，今猶未到達　述較此更詳之時期；若時期來臨，當能具體發表』日本現內閣所發表的國際政策，綱要如右；而昨日同盟社之半官電訉，復自反面作露骨之說明日，日本明確放棄『媚態外交』矣；夫自承媚態而昌言放棄，此其爲撒潑歟？抑猶是撒嬌歟？同盟電訉亦『語妙』矣哉！</p>
<p>就日本近衛內閣之國際政策，試作客觀之檢討，則有可得而言者：近十年來之國際，日本實開武力侵略之端，風聲所樹，星火燎原，世局遂如今日；而今日之世局，却復予日本侵略以强烈之鼓勵。觀彼開宗明義謂多數國家生成發展爲基調之新政治文化經濟亦已見其創成云，可知所憧憬者何似；而所謂大東亞共榮圈之擴及越南荷屬東印度，允見其爲世局鼓勵之後果。因果相生，慾求無饜，此其一也。中日戰爭在日本自始諱言之爲國際戰爭，而視之如彼國內問題；故稱之日中國事變，曰處理中國事變；如此屬辭，豈猶知顧忌國際公法而猶欲有所規避哉？目無中國，蔑爲附庸而已。或曲爲之辯，以爲彼僅自尊，非有所蔑，舍文崇實可也。而今近衛內閣於會議經旬，整理再三後之文字中，有言日『置重點於中國事變之完成』，意念在完成，則不諱不辯，抑亦絕不文飾之眞面目，蓋爲日本完成也，此其二也。納所謂『滿』與『華』，以及越南與荷屬東印度於大東亞經濟共榮圈之中，以自給自足爲共榮之水準，以充實軍備，增强國防爲自給目足之亟務。此所暴露者，既往與今後之侵略，絕非黷武之後果，且決心以侵略所得，强化其黷武、此其三也。日本於越南，初僅壓迫法國對華禁運，今則宣稱在彼『圈』內，此得尺進丈之步調也；彼於荷屬東印度，前外務大臣有田僅宣稱不容變更現狀，今亦宣稱在彼『圈』內，當時現狀固絕非在彼圈內者也。法荷兩國纔敗於德，僅息戰而未媾和，德國所將取之於法荷者尚未確定，而日本所欲攫歸圈內者，視德國允肯定且允肥碩，宜其暫時「不介入」以「媚態」向德國矣，此其四也。越南者，與英屬緬甸爲鄰，而可以直扼英國遠東鎖鑰新加玻之吭者也；荷屬東印度者，橫跨印度太平洋，梗於英國各屬之間，而可以遮斷英美兩國間之連繫者也；此而歸入日本之圈，其圈固爲日本對英美之『富有建設性及彈力性』之圈也，此其五也。</p>
<p>五者之外，有可得而窺知者：日本在現內閣之下，實以漁利與備戰爲國策。鑒於中國與蘇俄之間，甚爲友好，並無漁利可圖，故不復以反共之口頭禪，釀成蘇日兩國間之何種新磨擦；况攻華即是北淮梯階，自不必更言北進。南方各關係國之弱點甚多，遂窺伺較弱之點，銳意漁人之利。較弱允弱之殊，即日本現內閣所謂彈力性外交之主要對象也。彼以中日戰爭無法結束，故對歐戰暫無「介加」之餘力，遂無介加之決心；攫取漁利，祇恃恫嚇。恫嚇或效或不效，「友邦或成或不成」，漁利或得或不得，惟視當之者是否示弱。反之，如昨日某方電傳華盛頓消息，謂「如日海軍不肯冒戰爭之險，此間深信美海軍將開入中國海與黃海而強迫爲之」；如此宣言，亦無實效；蓋；本方運用恫嚇，決不示弱於反恫嚇，可斷言也。示弱者若有其人，漁利者宜有所得，然漁利亦必有其限度，於是而備戰尚矣。在彼圈內者，皆彼所欲得而予求予取之備戰資源也；所圈愈大則資源愈豐，軍備愈强；軍備愈强則所欲得而圈者必不僅越南荷印；生生不息，以迄於所謂「八絃一宇」之日本國本。各國其諦視之，其坐待之可也。</p>

<p>烚赤所跌甚微</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以匯兌報平、人心稍挫、開市竟撳十五元、錢兌業出銀號二十兩、爲五千五百十元、斯時銀號帮與金號頗有吃胃、曾回升十五元、銀號互做數十兩、爲五千五百二十五元、旋因某某兩錢兌業傾向拋出、且不久匯市微硬、金號與銀號亦來吐賣、竟一度慘落至五千四百六十元低價、後幸某錢兌業乘低補空、回升至五千五百元關邊、雖銀號拋出、重挫落至五千四百七十五元、終因匯市轉軟、引起相當買風、處於銀號及錢兌業等在扒下、午刻再見五千五百十五元高價、惟收盤前某錢兌業復吐、故遂吿五千五百是元收市、結果比上日軋跌十五元、收後潛勢緊穩、五千五百十五元曾有成交、午後週六無市、半天祇有六十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售價照烚赤較高十數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>

<p>證券暗盤、昨市甲種需要更爲殷切、丁種忽亦頗有人吸收、其他各種因肚亦爲之帶好、形勢轉爲帶强、甲種因逼近抽籤且籤支增加關係、丁種因流通籌碼極少、需要稍鉅卽感缺乏、前比丙種小一元左右者、今已市價相等、頗有起出丙種之希望、環境情形雖仍在醞釀期內、但一般人信心甚堅、不過時日問題而已、査交易所牌子（卽額定經紀人地位之權利）去年三四月間、新老牌子價目、爲五千至　萬元、今巳漲至二萬餘至三萬餘兀之多、故市上又傳有交易所不久將來行將復業云、昨日經過、仍係冉冉趨堅之象、其中以十六號搜購丁種獨多、甲種亦吸收不少、大康成收進甲種亦不少、故此兩種籌碼愈感枯竭、仁昌信孚恒孚鴻大聯益均有吸收、雖久豐一貫賣出、協興源稍有出籠、同康信昌均有賣出、而市氣仍爲多方優勢、結果一致回漲二角至四角半不等、成交總數共計約九十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<p>毛織品呢羢定貨，大半經洋行之手，由洋行向海外廠家接洽定貨，卽由洋行出文定單，交於號家。所以做呢羢生意的洋行，極爲衆盛，但是數十年來變遷亦大爲可觀，用將新舊時代的經過狀况，作一番檢討。</p>
<p>舊時代上海的呢羢定貨洋行，大多數均是英商。繼之者爲德商·美商·法商·其牌子最老爲榮泰·喊喱·順發·和記·和豐·泰和·德記·華記·公平·禮和·怡和·好華·公益·順全隆·沙遜等。次之爲魯麟·信記·美最時·洛士利·興泰·禪臣·天佑·康福·孔士·林南·安利·義記等。後以呢羢到銷日廣，上海現貨行家風起雲湧，華商日商現定行家，遂年增多，華商行家，有寗豐·兆豐·永豐·達豐·大康·洪盛·列鹽·、永肥·華倫·永泰·永和·美發·友誼·咸康·榮康·五雙·元康·華孚·美　等。日商洋行有三井·岩井·吉田·阿部市·伊籘·益記·仁昌·仁餘·柯漢記等·波蘭現貨洋行有滿海·石利洛·瑞文·華波·寶達·鑫康·寶達利等。同時英法德意瑞嗬諸商行帶做定貨者亦日增，有天祥·寳多·來培·亞尼·昌生·正昌·瑞康·老·茂·恒利·天福，永興·立興·實克·永樂·天豐·昌泰·咪吔·愼德·仁德·德華禮·義與·金海·福隆·東方·中華·利豐·好時·怡德·麥高·利紀生·彭德門等。　（未完）</p>

<p>路透社三日上海消息、據可靠方面消息、載見八月三日各晨報對二日領事團會議及就領袖領事發與各報之正式紀載所發之評論、未經領袖領事許可、該會議明白了解、經多時討論後而最後通過之決議案、其措詞絕無任何政治意義、凡含有此種意義之詞句、均於決議案通過前删去、</p>
<p>致局方函下週送出</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、聞諸可靠方面、領事團關於遏止本市恐怖行動之建議、諒將暫時展緩交予工部局、惟出席昨日（二日）會議之駐滬各國領事則抱一種希望、卽領事團對於工部局總董凱自威呼籲之覆文、將於下週初送出是、領事團昨日午後公佈之文吿、除正式決議案外並有丹麥總領事兼領袖領事希爾所發之簡略言論、希爾頃吿記者稱、渠所發簡略言論、竟予公布、殊可惋惜、關於昨日會議、渠無其他言論、惟有一點可吿者、卽領事團刻正準備覆文、不久卽將送交工部局是、他國領事對於領事團會議將有何種結果、皆不發表確切意見、僅某領事稱、渠對日總領事三浦所提警務處增加實力之建議、完全贊同、自工部局上週宣布商團俄國隊不久將併入警務處後、警務實力之增强、已在進行中、</p>
<p>政治意義一塲爭論</p>
<p>大陸報云、上海領事團昨日（二日）午後三時三十分起、在工部局會議室舉行會議、歷二小時半、議畢、發表決議案、（原文已見昨日本報）據同盟社消息、當討論決議案之措詞時、某總領事對案中「實際情形」一詞、聲明反對、其理由爲此詞涵有甚大之政治意義、日總領事三浦駁稱、此詞涵有政治意義、無待贅言、其意卽上海及其四週各區、已經日方佔領而在南京政府轄下是、經其餘各領事表同意後、某總領事卽撒回其反對、</p>
<p>三浦提議加强警力</p>
<p>三浦繼起發言、略謂日當局準備全力全作、以取締公共租界之恐怖活動、惟決議草案、表面似屬無得、實則不然、故應加以修正云、三浦提議之修正案、經通過而成決議案後、三浦又建議領事團訓令工部局、囑警務處加强實力、並與法租界警務處·日憲兵隊·日領事館警署及「市警局」作更密切而有效之合作、此爲撲滅恐怖行動之第一步驟、</p>
<p>揂節經費亦遭駁斥</p>
<p>當有某總領事起稱、工部局刻正力求撙節、三浦所提加强警務處實力之建議、難以實行、且與工部局採行之撙節政策不符、三浦駁稱、渠所提議警務處加强實力、與工部局撙節政策非不相符、因撙節之意、乃在節省若干不必要之費用也、允因觀於現局之故、警務處實有加强實力之亟切需要云、領事團對於此說、表示同意後、卽通過三浦之建議、</p>

<p>自進口物品申請外滙規則頒佈後、中央銀行之外滙藩核處卽宣吿結束、所有進口外滙審核事宜、併由財政部外滙審核委員會辦理、惟中中交農四行聯合辦事總處、設有滙兌處、所以外滙核定之權、現由外滙審核委員會担任初審、擬具審核意見、移送四行聯合總處之滙兌處複審、由滙兌處簽請理事會核定後、屬於軍政各機關者、移交軍政部辦理、屬於進口商者、復移交外滙審核委員會辦理、審核機構較前更爲嚴密、</p>

<p>知友過訪</p>
<p>律師梁伯華、字文中、現年四十九歲、廣東南海人，於民十五年九月、加入律師公會開業、卜居於北浙江路第一五一弄（卽龍吉里）七號、屋字兩幢、係獨家居住、歷有十餘年、樓下廂房間闢爲事務所、室內佈置雅潔、業務殊佳、置有汽車、其大門上標有南海梁寓銅牌一方、於昨日午後一時三十分許、有同鄉業照相業之程天賜者、年逾而立、過訪於其寓、梁乃留在客堂中共進午膳、言笑甚懽、詎知甫行餐畢、收拾殘羹之際、梁巳起身步入廂房事務所內、程乃移坐其靠牆紅木椅上、忽聞門外有叩門聲、當經女傭前往應門、</p>
<p>暴徒開槍</p>
<p>突有不速之客兩名、一御玄色香雲紗長衫、一衣香雲紗衫褲進內、詢問梁律師在家吾、女傭答謂在家、語聲未絕、兩暴徒卽邁步跨入客堂中、袖出手槍、首向程天賜狙擊一響、彈中胸脯要害、當即應聲踣地、鮮血汨汨而出、氣息僅屬、是時伯華正在廂房事務所內、驟聞槍聲、正擬出而探視時、孰知暴徒等又發槍向其開放多響、梁一時欲避不及、當塲計中左右手各一槍、左腿三槍、右腿一槍、左耳邊際擦過二彈、共計射七搶、</p>

<p>本文作者巴列伐拉Bhicoo　Batlivala女士，在英國担任律師，最近從美國各處演講印度問題回英。</p>
<p>這篇文章載在今年七月份亞洲雜誌。</p>
<p>道次歐戰爆發之後，印度卽感覺帝國主義又將以洶洶之勢捲土重來。印度軍隊，在去年八月，未得印度人的同意，卽行調出印度。印度被宣佈爲交戰國，也沒有徴求其同意；印度在一九三七年所獲的一些民治已如曇花一現，印度國防法所包含的許多嚴刻條規殊非必要。按照道項法令，違法者可處死刑，或終身放遂，或十年以上的監禁。這實在是對付印度人的殘酷無情的武器。</p>
<p>這種法令在三日之內卽忽忽通過，印度原可立卽採取强硬的不合作態度以爲對付。但印度沒有採取這樣行動，僅期待英國了解道一問題所引起的嚴重性。印度國民大會不獨在去年九月十八日通過決議對英作偉大的表示，卽在後來印度領袖與印度總督迭次會議時，亦復如此。道種表示的內容就是：如果英國宣佈她的和戰方針，及此項方針如何應用於印度，印度願與英國親善合作。印度所要求的是共享自由民治，並以同盟國的地位參加戰爭，但巳不能仍爲一個奴隸國。</p>
<p>戰爭開始十個月以來，英政府却毫不猶豫地加緊統治印度及其資源，同時並昭示世界，說這並不是干涉印度內政。英國爲微發印度資源起見，曾將遠東最大而爲印度人所有的泰太鋼鐵廠及狄格堡油田，都劃入「保護區，」由英人各省長直接管轄。狄格堡油田工人罷工要求改良待遇也被禁壓。所謂「保護區」大都原屬森林地帶及植茶　等，就是種稅源地帶。卽使甘地與尼赫魯，沒有獲得當地省長的許可，也不能走進這種區　。</p>
<p>英政府所慣用的口頭禪，就是所謂印度敎徒與回敎徒的問題。印度的有印度敎徒二萬七千萬人，的有回敎徒八千萬人。英人的論　是說，如果印度獨立了，印度敎徒將壓迫回敎徒。英當局並以回敎徒反對印度國民大會，不願印度脫離英帝國而獨立，作爲宜傳口實。但這種宣傳對於幾千萬的回敎徒是一種很大的汚蔑。回敎徒加入國民大會的有好幾萬，除此而外，還有許多有地位有勢力的回敎團體擁護國民六會的政策。西北邊省有百分之九十五的回敎徒擁護國民大會政策。國民大會的主席也是　位回敎徒哩。</p>
<p>印度生活程度現在不斷的高漲着，早已窮困不堪的印度農工，更感生活艱難，印度當局竟調動軍隊，向抗議食糧價格過分高漲的羣衆開槍射擊。普通印度人如果每天能獲得一餐，已屬萬幸。據英國醫官報吿，印度人營養不良的業已佔全人口百分之六十一。如孔坡和孟買等城的紡織工業區，工人由於糧食市價在漲，工資不够購買食物，已有不少次的暴動。</p>
<p>印度物價將繼續高漲，並要像上次歐戰中一樣，再度償付大量的血汗金錢。上次歐戰期內，英政府曾使「印度流乾了血。」在這次戰爭中，印度又感覺到戰爭所賜與的重負。雖則印度與美國的貿易，處於出超地位，印度的美匯，却因英國把印度對美出口貨折合英鎊計算的原故，極感缺少。印度現仍被迫採用　羅比等於　先零六便士的法定比價，而不准實行歷年來所要求的一先零四便士的比價。</p>
<p>印度準備銀行係受印度中央政府管轄，換言之，卽等於受英國政府的管轄，也就是等於受英格蘭銀行的管轄。印度準備銀行雖有兩個印度董事，他們却是帝國主義的擁護者。該銀行且巳由印度中央政府，根據印度國防法，授權管理一切貨幣，金條，證券，外滙。因此印度金融，不由印度人控制，　由準備銀行控制了，結果又將使印度人的血再流乾次。</p>
<p>印度的正規軍業已動員，駐防星加坡，亞丁，叙利亞，埃及，巴力期坦等地，且曾有部份開到歐洲西錢作戰過。當加拿大或澳洲的軍隊開到歐洲的時候，英國大臣曾飛往歡迎，印度車隊離鄉背井，跋涉長途，開到歐洲的時候，英國報紙上甚致沒有兩行地位加以登　。英政府雖曾允許印度中央議會，印度軍隊，不獲其同意，不調離印度，但印度軍隊這次調開印度，却極秘密。在實際上，印度是英國人力物力的貯藏室，但印度質問英國，是否准其享受戰爭的利益，及自由民治的權利，英政府却頒佈印度國防法，把幾千印度人，廋死獄中，以爲答復。</p>
<p>在美國大學受過高深敎育的那拉揚的被監禁，是英國統治印度不顧止義最顯著的例子。他被關禁起來旣不受審判，也沒有人曉得他所犯何罪。他入獄時會對於印度參戰，作很長的演說，其中　段說，　個奴隸沒有保衛奴隸制的義務。其唯的義務是去解除他的束縛。</p>
<p>甘地對於那拉掦的入獄，也曾發表文字，說　那拉　的逮捕極爲不幸。他不是　個普通工人。他是一個社會主義的權威學者。他是一個優秀的　士。他爲國家解放，　牲一切。他的勤勞是無比的。他耐苦的能力也無人可及。我不曉得什麽言論使其觸犯法紀。在第　次不台作運　時，政府曾不顧一切逮捕阿里兄弟。此次逮捕是不是預定計劃，　僅是一個過分熱　的官吏所　的錯誤昨？</p>
<p>目下印度不獨關心內部的形勢，也注意到世界大局的發展。印度特別關心中日戰爭的結果。印度輿論，　爲英國對日妥協　，是出　自右的動機。</p>
<p>自尼赫魯去年拜訪重慶後，中印邦交日趨親密。幾世紀來，此兩國總是相互親善，而尼赫魯的拜訪，又恢復了相互的利益。最近，尼赫魯曾發表一文，說「未來時事的形態，不問其最後形態如何，中印兩國對之定將加以極大的影響。各處咸以世界新秩序與世界合作爲標榜。中印兩國如果不被重視，世界必無穩固的有效的合作之可言。」因此印度注意中國及英國在遠東的政策。英政府如繼續實行妥協政策，以損害中國，印度卽將有强硬的反饗。印度國民大會曾明白表示印度對中國具有十二分的同情，印度曾派遺　藥救護隊至中國，卽其明證。</p>
<p>印度現巳在强有力的領袖甘地及尼赫魯領導下團結起來，英屬印度及印度各邦人民，無階級及信仰的差別，一致擁護獨立運動，並且也巳有了準備。如果印度爲自由民治須付重大的代價，亦所不辭。</p>
<h3 id="c105">英國的空軍戰士 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>英國空軍隊員大都是年富力强的靑年戰士。他們曾經盡職掩護英法聯軍自鄧扣克撒退回國，現正擔負着保衛本國領土的重任。他們在鄧扣克海灘上空作戰，在數量上確是以一敵五十三，作戰已經很苦了。現在德軍轟炸機成羣結隊，更番轟炸英倫三島，他們隨時隨地須起而迎擊，責任自然更加艱巨。</p>
<p>英國這次作戰，空軍的準備極不充分，但是他們所擊落的德機至少是一對三之比。這次戰爭的無數英雄中，這些飛行隊員當然首屈一指，他們非但要駕駛戰機，不時還要駕駛轟炸機深人德軍後方夜襲。這些戰士究竟是何等樣人呢？</p>
<p>每隊空軍隊長大都修飾整潔；頭髮梳得沒有一根亂着，手指甲好像剛纔修過，軍服筆挺，更不在話下。每　飛機十二架，每個飛行員面貌不同，各如其人，要概括的說出他們是何等樣人，甚爲困難。但是無論他們是正規空軍，或是輔助隊，却都具備着某種共同的特質。</p>
<p>他們都是身材瘦小，尤其是戰鬥機駕駛員。這無非是因爲飄風式或噴火式飛機的座位沒有多大廻旋的餘地之故罷了。他們雖都瘦小，却個個强幹。他們跑步上機塲的神情，好像網球家上塲比賽一樣。</p>
<p>這些靑年人，固較之上次歐戰後般人心目中的狂飲的飛行員，大不相同。他們不大有假期，偶爾告假，也不通宵達旦的在外在歡作樂。從前半醉的飛行員還須帶着香檳跨人機身的情形現在完全沒有了。</p>
<p>現代車用飛機非但沒有藏置酒瓶的地位，並且機件構造複雜，每個飛行員如其不能鎭定着他的神經，決沒有生還的希望，他無力殺敵致果，那更不容說了。</p>
<p>今日空軍戰術，較之上次大戰時也已完全不同。上次大戰時的飛行英雄如皮孝普和巴爾等人都是「單槍匹馬」作戰的。他們經離開地面，便可隨心所欲。今日卽使是戰鬥　隊也須以一個單位作戰。每個駕駛員都須用無綫電同隊長隨時聯絡。他有越規行動模樣的時候，隊長便立刻會把他糾正。每隊隊長則與空　根據地聯絡，隨時須依照司令部的訓令作戰。他隨時須報告上峯。他耳朵上戴的聽昔機和嘴巴上套的發音　都是每個駕駛員頭飾的部份，這可證明從前個人主義時代已經沒落了。</p>
<p>這些空軍隊員留下的印象就楚他們都是優秀靑年。夏日晴空碧綠，這些訓練有素的靑年，有的竟去不復返，未免使人感動。他們的年齡多在十八歲至二十八歲之間，平均不過二十三歲，最優等的飛行員都是年齡較輕的。在二十四歲已經算老了。森陀蘭大飛艇隊員七八人，隊長年紀或者還不到二十四歲。以如此年輕的戰士，負起保衛國家的責任，這是何等重大的責任！</p>
<p>最幸運的也是入伍爲飛行員。他們軍事操練和練習飛行，爲時雖短，都認眞非常，身心都經過嚴格的測騐。一架飛機一旦付托給他們，便是他們無上的榮幸。他們駕機騰空，所接觸的無非是一具無綫電聽音機對你發號施令，與步兵血搏情形絕然不同。他如其運道好，或者會一連擊下敵機數架，如其運氣壞，那你就會給敵人擊落。每架飛機所裝汽油大致足敷兩小時的飛行；兩小時之內，如果一切順利，你得飛回根據地。未幾，你或者又巳出發了。</p>
<p>現代戰爭裏飛機的速度會使你的神經支持不了。除非平時訓練釗莫不關心，鎭定到泰山崩於前而色不變的程度，纔可以對付。英國的靑年飛行員，除技能精良外，還具備着極强的戰鬥精神，飛行技能與戰鬥力實在是互相爲用的，這便是英國干城所寄。</p>
<p>下面是英國一位空軍戰士在出征前寄給他母親的一封家書，措辭悲壯，不像二十餘歲靑年的口氣。這信後來在倫敦泰晤士報發表，作爲靑年的模範。信裏說，「……我在這次戰爭裏任務重大。我門的巡邏隊遠在北海上空，爲護送艦隊及運輸船隻，協助維持貿易路錢，我們的報吿足以救護多少人的生命。……那些爲國服務的人不應期望報酬：我們假使視國家爲食息之地，那未免糟塌自己了。</p>
<p>歷史上不少光榮的令名，他們犧牲一切創造不列顚帝國，那裏尚有和平，正義，自由，可言，那裏有較高的文明正在進化着，絕非他處所及。今日我們所遭遇的是對基督敎和西洋文明極大的有組織的進攻，實乃有史以來所未見。我生逢其辰，得受充分訓練，捨身報國。……我仍謂這次戰爭實爲一大佳事；每個人正有機會效法先烈。……宇宙之大，沒有空間時間的限制，一個人的生命有無價值，要視其犠牲的程度爲轉移。我們出生在世是要取得不可剝奪的人格和品性。只知吃睡，繁榮生殖，那與動物何異。</p>
<p>我堅決相信萬惡是造物用來試騐我們的。不取輕易的出路，而惟道義的原則是尚，聖經上例不勝舉。戰爭的最後試騐已經到來，我的品性已經充分發展了，這是一種極大的恩賜……</p>

<p>自包犧氏儷皮成禮，夫夫婦婦而家道正，嗣時厥後，妻之外又有妾，如天子有后有妃嬪，諸侯有夫人有勝姒，推而至於大夫士庶人，亦莫不有筵室小妻，或備執巾之選，或徵螽羽之祥。古人數婦人惡德，曰妒，曰淫，曰多言，曰不孝，皆干七出之條。妒之一字，鬚眉或不免，女性陰險而又專一，行之於其夫，故倍行得力耳。閫敎之不謹，亦天性之使然。方其待字也，女生外向；迨其已嫁也，終日勃谿，視舅姑如陌路，而且絮聒時聞，專房是擅。昔者唐兵都尚書伍環勅賜一宮女，皆國色，妻柳氏妒爛一女頭，髮盡禿，大宗聞之，賜以金瓶酒云：「飲之立死，不妒卽不須飲。」柳氏拜勅，一飲而盡，然非鴆也。旣醒，帝謂環曰：「人不畏死，朕尚不能禁，卿其奈何？」詔二女別宅安置。房元齡夫人至妒，帝令皇后召夫人謂曰：「寗不妒而生，寗妒而死？」曰：「妾寗妒而死。」乃酌一巵酒分之，一舉便盡。帝曰；「我尚畏見，何况元齡。」兩事如出一轍。</p>

<p>在沒有說新世界之前，我們且先看看現在的世界。請問現在的世界，是一個怎樣的世界呢？我想人人都得承認現在的世界，是一個痛苦的世界，沒有一處是樂土。有人因為甲地不太平，搬到乙地去居住，豈知好景不常，乙地又是戰雲彌漫，不能安身。國家與國家，有大規模的戰事，爭城奪地，殺人流血。個人與個人又是彼此猜忌，彼此暗鬥，造成許多不幸事件。甚至家庭骨肉之間，也是積不相容。</p>
<p>我們每天讀新聞紙，除了戰事消息以外，我們所讀到的新聞是：某家的金條被人搶劫某旅館有人服毒自殺。某處荒地上有被人支解的屍首。某旅館有被人勒死的女客。某。處某人被綁或被路劫。若是我們在馬路上走的時候，肯留一點意的話，你就看見馬路的兩旁，有許多蓬首垢面，骨瘦如柴，求生不得，求死不能的男女，躺在那裏呻吟。現在的世界，可說到處充滿了煩悶，悲哀，求痛苦。我們追源探本，就知道造成這種痛苦世界的原因，是由於世人的劣根性，說得清楚一點，就是因為世人的罪。</p>
<p>我們需要一個新世界，我們不願常是這樣煩悶，悲哀，痛苦。但要世界更新，非先產除人心的罪惡不可。要產除人心的罪惡，不能倚靠政治的力量，也不能倚靠教育的功能，乃是在於每個人的澈底覺悟。單是澈底覺悟，還是不夠，還要有一種忍痛的決心，　能將心中的罪惡連根產去。如果人人能澈底覺悟，有除惡務盡的決心，都做一個新人，世界自然更新了。不過，人類怎能有這樣的覺悟，又怎能有這樣的決心呢？（八月八日再登）</p>

<p>— 唐達</p>
<p>在戰爭的時候，林肯總統常到各處醫院去訪問，士兵們都感到非常興奮，他們可以看到他的慈祥的面孔，和鼓勵的語句。</p>
<p>在某個醫院裏的第二十六號床位上，躺著一個十六歲的孩子，他受了重傷，看樣子不能再活下去了。林肯總統站在床邊，當他握著孩子蒼白色手時，開始用低微的母親般的聲音問道：「可憐的孩子，我可以替你做一些事情嗎？」</p>
<p>孩子凝住著雙眼在林肯的面上，問道：「你願意寫封信給我的母親嗎？」</p>
<p>林肯答道：「當然願意。」隨後拿了筆和墨水，寫好了一封很長的信，然後對孩子說：「等會兒我投到郵政箱去。我還可以幫助你什麼嗎？」</p>
<p>孩子回答道：「你願意坐在牀邊等到最後一息嗎？我覺得我就要死了。」</p>
<p>這幾句話打動了總統的心，淚水從他的眼裏湧出來了。那孩子動也不動，亦不說什麼了。總統從四點鐘坐起，到七點鐘果然到最後一息了。他像孩子的像樣一樣，不斷地撫摩著孩子的手，當孩子的面上現出死容時候，他便撲在孩子的面上，把孩子的眼睛閉起來，痛苦地注視著孩子的安靜的面孔。</p>

<p>但你可知道我是怎樣的對待他呢？我在影片中竟是這麼一回事，抓起污泥來，拋在他上海灘遊散時所穿的那件美麗的白衫子上。呀！我是何等的痛恨這回事啊！試想我怎能施出辣手來，把污泥拋在一位我所歡喜的人的身上呢？何況他身上又穿著一件雪白的衣服，頭上又戴著雪白的髮套呢！可甘，我委實是辦不了的。那時我雖抓了一把泥在手中，擎起手來，卻老是不肯拋出去。導演白德勒先生放聲喊道：「秀蘭，快拋快拋！你在那裏等甚麼啊？」我害羞著不敢把心愛巴利瑪亞先生而不願拋泥的話說出來。但你知道巴裏摩亞先生又怎樣呢？他立刻向我高呼道：「秀蘭，你快快拋吧！將那一大把的泥，盡量的拋過來——用力的拋，要拋滿我這件白衫子！」</p>
<p>可甘，你瞧我如何是好，只得橫著心，將那一把污泥拋過去了。當下那黑黑的泥，沾滿了他那件白衫子，連白頭髮上也沾到了。我等到這一個鏡頭一拍完，立刻跑到他老人家跟前，說道：「呀，巴裏摩亞先生，對不起得很，我不得不把那污泥拋在你身上了！」他只微笑著，深深地一鞠躬，親我的手，接著說道：「在這一國裏，定有一千萬人願意把他們禮拜日穿的最好的衣服，接受你手中拋過來的污泥。小姑娘，我就是一千萬人中的一人！可甘，你想這一節故事不是很可愛麼？</p>
<p>我也愛上了加萊古拍，但他的身體太長了，和我太不相配，所以我拋下了他。</p>
<p>此外，我所愛的，要算是佐爾麥克利和鬈毛狗漢納福了。我心中委決一下，應該嫁與那一個才好。我在主演「小女郎」一片時遇見了他們倆，可甘，漢納福並不是真的一頭鬈毛狗，這是他的綽號，他實在是馬戲班中一個小醜，一個英國小醜。他在馬背上玩種種把戲，直能使你笑痛了肚子。他比了大象吃花生時的神氣，更要來得有趣。他平日所認識的小醜，也著實不少，我要是嫁了他，可以常在馬戲班中玩耍哩。</p>
<p>至於佐爾麥克利，也是很好玩的。他有一副好萊塢最好的肩胛，可以給我騎在上面，有一天我們在綠極磯附近的休荷湖上，拍攝「小女郎」中野宴一場，他給我騎在背上玩了一下。我穩穩地騎著，把我短裙的花邊包在他頭的　面，瞧去好像戴了一頂老祖母的軟帽。那時媽媽和導演攝影師他們瞧見了，都笑著喊道：「快瞧那老太太麥克利啊！秀蘭騎在老太太麥克利的背上！」當下我和佐爾也同聲大笑起來。</p>

<p>我最崇拜的人物　最崇拜的人物，以一人為限，否則最字便落空。人物不論古今，不問中外，都可以的，崇拜的理由，是全篇文字中重要之點，必須詳細說明。至於文章的格局，大致可分幾種；開頭便提出最崇拜的人物，入後逐項說明崇拜的理由，這是第一種方法；開頭先提最崇拜的標準，入後說出人物姓名，把他的事實，與理由作一對比，這是第二種方法；開頭先說幾個崇拜的人物，入後說到最崇拜的人物，逐一說明理由，這是第三種方法；方法很多，上述三法，不過舉個例子！</p>
<p>貧人的夏天生活　這個題目，你先要把對象認識清楚，至少要實地考察貧人的實際生活，得到幾個要點，把這幾個要點，詳細描寫，才句句有著落，大至說來，應該著眼於衣食住三點，從衣食住三點上，顯出貧人夏天生活的苦楚，倘使你有些感想，不妨發表出來，最好要有具體辦法，空言感慨，沒有多少意思，所謂具體辦法，可分地方當局應該做的，社會人士應該做的，兒童們應該做的。你能做依照我的方法寫文章，一定十分精采。</p>

<p>下面印花的意義，值得向諸位小朋友說：</p>
<p>正中的圖案，「申」是申字的古體，鐘形是木鐸。</p>
<p>申報負有提倡教育宣揚文化的重任，所以採取「天將以夫子為木鐸」這句話的涵義，用木鐸來象徵著申報所負的重大使命！</p>
<p>這次用來作為徵文印泥花，諸位小朋友的試卷上都該照章剪貼一枚，否則不論文稿內容如何，試卷一概無效，千萬注意！</p>

<h3 id="c115">好萊塢中國女明星　黃柳霜從影的經過 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— 李敦</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>黃柳霜早年在好萊塢時常扮演辱華影片的角色，而毫不自覺，像以前的「月宮寶盒」便是一個很好的例子。所以國人對她，並沒有什麽好感。自從她返國考察之後，對祖國印象甚好，便決計改變作風，軍興以還，各國人士莫不異口同聲，熱烈地贊助中國抗建勝利；所以，這位黃女士更感到往昔思想，行動的錯誤，體味着祖國究屬可愛的意念，</p>
<p>因此她的思想完全改變，從今以後她要走着「爲祖國爭光」的路徑。</p>
<p>黃柳霜從事電影，己有很久的歷史。對於她的經過，很少有人提及，我來作一個簡括的叙述：</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>她在幼年時候，也是一位十足的影迷，時常要逃學出來去看五分鐘的電影；回家，更以床鏽作舞臺，自己作演員，表演着在電影內看見對於自己感有興趣的各種姿勢給她雙親看。某日傍晚，她正散步的時光，忽然來了一位電影公司訪求中國演員的負責人，對她說道：「上帝啊！要是你保佑她的話。希望你使這位美麗的大眼女郎，很快的應允我，願作一個中國的演員吧」。當時，她在受寵若驚之中便很快的應允了這位負責人；雖然她在父母面前耗去了不少口舌，流掉了不少眼淚，可是結果，她終於獲了個心願上的安慰。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>她的處女作是在導演尼藍（Marshall　Neilan）指導之下，做一個中國妻子的主要角色；後來又在一張五彩片（Narme　Talmadge）中作配角，然而她却博得了許多導演們莫大的讚美；原來在這張影片中，她須得哭，而她郤眞的哭個不停，引得觀衆手帕盡爲濕透。當時有個導演說：一給她一隻救生船罷，她就要在自己的淚河裏淹死了。」可見她那時表淸的一斑。此後，她便在飛來伯（Dauglas　Faribanks）導演之下，演着辱華片「月宮寶盒」內的一個配角</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>不久，她被英、法、德等各國影業公司邀請着拍戲，所以她便離開好萊塢去作了一次歐洲之遊，她的成名亦就在這時。沒隔幾年，她又重人了好萊塢的懷抱。最近她在發表談話中說「一年復一年，中國精神Chinese　Soul）已在我的身上成長了，現在我是完全中國化了。」這話是多麽的懇摯，而值得我人的佩服呢。</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>德國駐華大使館，最近從柏林運到一部宣傳影片「砲火的洗禮Raptism　of　Fire）於一十九日下午九時，在上海德國學校內放映，招待僑民和中外新聞界。</p>
<p>「砲火的洗禮」是一部描寫波蘭戰事中德國空軍活躍情形的宣傳影片，由德攝影師柏特侖等二十人攝製。</p>
<p>波蘭戰事中，德軍進行閃電戰術，十八日便吿結束，這使攝製感到困難。當時參加拍攝的除工作人員二十七人外，還利用飛機三架，一架是亨克爾機，用以拍攝戰景，一架爲蓉克機，供運輸機具，一架爲慢飛之斯托克機，用以攝取空戰後死寂的景况，如經戰事毀壤的華沙，和遭受猛烈轟炸的公路等。</p>
<p>片中幾個德國空軍轟炸的鏡頭，使人怵目驚心。那天晚問，同時並開映「挪威戰事」新聞片，官傳所採取的「閃電戰術」裏面有幾個在奥沙陸附近俘獲敵兵的鏡頭，更强調了德國在挪戰事的猛烈。</p>

<p>中國劇社的「漢高祖」喧傳已久，其間一度因劇作者費泰染病，有以「香妃」作爲處女公演之說，但是現在已決定「漢高祖」了，並已定下星期開始排演，導演是「孔夫子」導演費穆至於公演日期，因爲沒有相當戲院，不能定奪。不過據傳新藝劇社的「海國英雄」巳在和某戲院接洽，如果成功，「中國」的「漢高祖」，也可蟬聯演出。</p>

<p>— 德網</p>
<p>還有記得以前在某片中有一個荒誕滑稽的故事：有輛汽車在公路上飛馳，突然路旁跳出一個乞丐，很魯莽地不顧前後，穿越馬路，結果被汽車輾斃，血肉糢糊，軀幹四肢分散地面，闖禍的汽車逃跑了。漸漸遠遠地來了一個怪者，他走近乞丐屍體旁，把殘零的四肢，搽些油膏，和軀幹湊合一起，呵了一口氣後，這可憐的乞丐竟復活了。拍攝這類人被汽車輾斃的方法，非常簡易，演員先行躺在地上，待汽車走近他身旁，這時開麥拉暫停拍攝，導演將一個特製的四肢能分離的木人，代替演員，臥在地上，讓汽車輾過，而後再在木人身上塗些像血樣的流質，看去已很活龍活現，足够能騙過觀衆的眼睛了！類乎這種騙人的西洋鏡，不知有多少，作者也不願多寫了。</p>
<p>（六）彩電影電影剛發明時，衹有黑白兩色，這當然還不能使人够滿意，於是科學家們便繼續潛心研究，設法將單調的黑白片，改進爲悅目的五彩片。他們起先想用顏色塗在片上，但是結果這種着色的五彩片，因爲不能十分精細，所以不够像眞，後來再經研究，纔想出利用印刷用的三色版原理，發明天然色的五彩片，製造的原理和方法大概如下：</p>

<p>第四章　幾種推想</p>
<p>霍桑點點頭，便向電梯間走去。我一壁跟隨着他，一壁繼續發問。</p>
<p>「倪金壽還在找尋這姓余的嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，這姓余的旣然暫時失踪，他自然也無從着手。他曾打電話到總署裏去，通知我他先要跟我談一談，然後再想進行的方法。」</p>
<p>「那末，怎麽我剛才好像聽得他要到揚子旅社去？」</p>
<p>「那是他依了我的話去，去調査陸健笙昨夜的行踪的。」這時我們早已站住在電梯間面前。電梯下來了，鋼門拉開以後，吐出了一大羣人，內中也有不少妖冶的女性。我們進了電梯，彼此不再說話。電梯一層層地上升，到了第七層時，我們便走出來。這旅館是上海高價旅館之一。在這裏出進的人，外表上好像都是生活富麗的資產階級，其實我相信如果剝下了他們的面具，裏面也儘多「悽慘」人物，而且所幹的事，也儘多「不可吿人。」我們在那舖着狹長地毯的甬道中轉了幾個灣，才找到七七四號室。室內前那塊小小的玻璃牌上，果然寫着「金君」一字。霍桑在那關着的室門口站了一站，並不立即敲門。他向左右兩端一望，有一個穿白號衣的侍役，正從東端走過來。霍桑把手揮到衣袋裏去，立卽又拔出來，迎着那個茶房走去。我瞧見他有一種極敏捷的動作，彷彿把什麼東西向那茶房的手裏一塞。</p>
<p>他開口說：「七十一號，我要間你一句話。」（六五）</p>

<p>Chongqing: The public is paying close attention to the announcement that the ban on the free import of gasoline into Free China will be lifted for three months. According to the announcement issued by the Liquid Fuel Control Commission: "The import of gasoline has always required a license issued by this Commission. However, to facilitate the import of gasoline by private commercial organizations, this Commission has obtained the approval of the Ministry of Finance to not prohibit the import of gasoline into the interior from August 1st to October 31st. During these three months, the import or sale of gasoline will not require a license or the payment of customs duties. After the deadline, commercial organizations must apply for a license."

<h3 id="e16">Japan After Abandoning the So-Called "Appeasing Diplomacy" <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>After the Konoe Cabinet of Japan was formed in the middle of last month, it made a public announcement to both domestic and foreign audiences on the 1st of this month. It is said that the matter pertains to Japan's national policy and that "the opinions between the Cabinet and the General Staff have been completely unified." This newspaper refers to it as the "Fundamental National Policy of the Konoe Cabinet." At the same time, Foreign Minister Matsuoka's speech was also published. Extracting the parts related to international affairs from what was published, we have the following:</p>
<p>"The world is now encountering a period of great historical transformation, and a new political, cultural, and economic order based on the emergence and development of many countries has already begun to take shape."</p>
<p>"In view of the current new situation both domestically and abroad, we should base ourselves on a national defense system that utilizes the total strength of the nation, strengthen our military preparations sufficiently to achieve our national policy without regret, and our current diplomacy should take the construction of a new order in East Asia as its foundation, placing emphasis on the completion of the China Incident. At the same time, we should take a broad view of the changing international situation and consider constructive and flexible policies to promote the progress of our national destiny."</p>
<p>"Based on the economically autonomous construction of Japan, Manchuria, and China, with the Empire as the center, we will establish the foundation of a national defense economy. (1) With Japan, Manchuria, and China as a ring, we will establish a cooperative economic sphere encompassing Greater East Asia..."</p>
<p>"Previous cabinets, in their diplomatic policies, have elaborated on the handling of the China Incident, cooperating with those who hold good intentions towards Japan and eliminating those who obstruct us. However, this was only possible given the international situation at the time. As for the current Cabinet's diplomatic policy, to implement our foreign policy thoroughly, we must engage in active activities. In the current environment, we must forge friendships with nations that can be made into allies. However, there will be a distinction between successful and unsuccessful attempts to forge alliances. If a country has been repeatedly approached without success, we will no longer make efforts to shake hands with them. The policy of non-intervention will remain in place for the time being. The establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will begin with Japan, Manchuria, and China as its foundation. The handling of the China Incident remains the main task. It goes without saying that East Asia, including the South Seas, is included. The goal is to include Japan, Manchuria, China, Vietnam, the Dutch East Indies, and others, establishing a self-sufficient and stable East Asian sphere."</p>
<p>"The new Cabinet's diplomatic policy has not yet reached the stage where it can be described in greater detail. When the time comes, it will be able to be announced specifically." The outline of the Japanese current Cabinet's international policy is as above. Moreover, yesterday's semi-official telegram from Domei News Agency bluntly stated from the opposite perspective that Japan has clearly abandoned "appeasing diplomacy." Is this the behavior of a rogue admitting its past behavior, or is it still a coy display? Domei's telegram is indeed "wonderfully worded"!</p>
<p>If we try to make an objective examination of the international policy of the Konoe Cabinet, we can say the following: In the international arena over the past ten years, Japan has been the first to initiate armed aggression. The resulting turmoil has spread like wildfire, and the world situation is as it is today. However, today's world situation has once again given strong encouragement to Japan's aggression. Observing that they explicitly stated that a new political, cultural, and economic order based on the emergence and development of many countries has already begun to take shape, we can see what they are longing for. The expansion of the so-called Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to include Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies clearly shows the result of the encouragement from the world situation. Cause and effect reinforce each other, and desires are insatiable. This is the first point. From the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan has avoided calling it an international war, viewing it as its domestic problem. Therefore, it calls it the China Incident and says it is handling the China Incident. With such wording, does it still know to be wary of international law and want to evade it in some way? It does not see China, treating it as a mere dependency. Or, to defend it in a roundabout way, it may be said that it only respects itself, not despising others, and that abandoning literary embellishments for practical matters is acceptable. However, now the Konoe Cabinet, in its documents produced after weeks of meetings and repeated revisions, states that it "places emphasis on the completion of the China Incident." The idea is in completion, so it does not hide or dispute it, but reveals the true face of having absolutely no literary embellishments. It is for the completion of Japan. This is the second point. To include the so-called "Manchuria" and "China," as well as Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies, in the Greater East Asia Economic Co-Prosperity Sphere, with self-sufficiency as the standard of co-prosperity and with strengthening military preparations and national defense as the urgent task of achieving self-sufficiency. What this exposes is that past and future aggression is by no means the result of militarism, and it is determined to strengthen its militarism with the spoils of aggression. This is the third point. In Vietnam, Japan initially only pressured France to ban exports to China, but now it declares that it is within its "sphere." This is a step-by-step progression. In the Dutch East Indies, former Foreign Minister Arita only declared that changes to the status quo would not be tolerated, but now it also declares that it is within its "sphere." At the time, the status quo was certainly not within its sphere. France and the Netherlands have only been defeated by Germany and have only suspended hostilities without concluding peace treaties. What Germany will take from France and the Netherlands is not yet certain, but what Japan wants to seize for its sphere is seen as certainly definite and certainly substantial. It is appropriate that it temporarily "does not intervene" and uses "appeasing diplomacy" towards Germany. This is the fourth point. Vietnam is adjacent to British Burma and can directly seize the throat of Singapore, the key to Britain's Far East. The Dutch East Indies straddles the Indian and Pacific Oceans, obstructing communication between Britain's various territories and can cut off the connection between Britain and the United States. If this is included in Japan's sphere, then its sphere is certainly a "constructive and flexible" sphere for Japan to use against Britain and the United States. This is the fifth point.</p>
<p>Besides these five points, we can get a glimpse of the following: Under the current cabinet, Japan is, in fact, pursuing a national policy of profiteering and preparing for war. In view of the fact that China and Soviet Russia are very friendly and there is no opportunity for profiteering, it will no longer use the rhetoric of anti-communism to create any new friction between the Soviet Union and Japan. Moreover, attacking China is the stepping stone to invading the north, so there is no need to say more about advancing north. The relationship with Southern countries is weak. Then, it should be able to take advantage. That weakness is what Japan's current Cabinet calls the main target of flexible diplomacy. Because the Sino-Japanese War cannot be ended, it has no surplus strength to "intervene" in the European War, so it has no determination to intervene. Seizing the opportunity to profit relies only on intimidation. Intimidation may or may not be effective, "allies may or may not be made," and profiteering may or may not be achieved, but it depends on whether the target shows weakness. On the contrary, such as yesterday's message from a certain party in Washington saying, "If the Japanese navy is unwilling to risk war, it is deeply believed here that the U.S. Navy will enter the China Sea and the Yellow Sea and force it to do so." Such a declaration is also ineffective. The power of intimidation must not show weakness when being threatened. Anyone who shows weakness, the exploiter will gain an advantage, but those profiteers have limits. That is why preparing for war is so important. War resources are the resources that it wants to obtain and demand from those within that circle. The larger the circle, the more abundant the resources, and the stronger the military preparations. The stronger the military preparations, then what they want to obtain and encircle must not be limited to Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies; perpetually, until the so-called "Eight Corners of the World Under One Roof" of Japan's national foundation. Let all countries watch carefully and wait to see what happens.</p>
<h3 id="e17">China Will Not Discuss Peace Under the Current Circumstances: Peace Rumors Are Japanese Peace Offensive; Central Government Has Permitted Communist Expansion <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to well-informed sources, there is no so-called peace movement here, and the issue of peace will not be discussed, at least for the moment. Chinese sources believe that the peace rumors are a "peace offensive" by Japan, and point out that China will not accept negotiations under the current circumstances. Regarding the rumors from Hong Kong that the Communist Party has made new demands of Chongqing, well-informed sources here state that discussions are underway between Chongqing and Communist leaders to reach a satisfactory solution regarding the disposition of Communist forces and areas under their control during military operations. It is also pointed out that this proposal is not being discussed as a demand, but rather as a means of dealing with the temporary situation. Because Communist forces are cooperating in certain areas, these areas have been placed under their control for the sake of expediency. For example, certain parts of the provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, and Shandong. However, this does not mean that these provinces have been given to the Communist Party. In fact, the chairmen of these provinces are all appointed by the Central Government, and military operations in these areas are under the command of the commanders of the Central Government. Currently, military affairs in Shanxi, Suiyuan, Hebei, and Chahar are still under the command of Yan Xishan, Wei Lihuang, and Hu Zongnan. Pang Bingxun has succeeded Lu Zhonglin as the chairman of Hebei Province, and Shen Honglie is the chairman of Shandong Province. Also, because the Communist forces have been permitted to expand by the Central Government, the funds allocated to the Communist Party have naturally increased. (3rd Dispatch from Reuters)</p>

<p>Chongqing: This morning, various Chinese newspapers criticized Konoe's remarks on Japan's new fundamental policy, unanimously expressing the view that its purpose is fourfold: (1) to conquer China; (2) to expand to the South Sea region; (3) to reorganize Japan's political and economic system along fascist lines; and (4) to intensify the economic exploitation of the occupied areas of China. In addition to reiterating China's determination to resist, the newspapers also urged countries with interests in the Far East to provide material assistance to China, saying that this is the only effective way to protect their own interests.

Recently, the Administration has submitted a request to the highest authorities to implement the regulations of the New County System Implementation Outline, with the county as the unit for cooperative development, and to strive to have cooperatives in each township and village throughout the country in a semi-compulsory manner, with each household having at least one cooperative member, so that cooperative undertakings can penetrate deeply into society.

<p>Fuzhou: A Central News Agency reporter met with Chairman Chen Yi at a certain place this morning and inquired about the King's purpose of Fujian's five-year economic construction. He said that this plan is for the people's livelihood, focusing on agricultural production, building water conservancy projects, and developing small machinery industries and handicrafts, with the aim of increasing production, cultivating the people's strength, and enriching the people's livelihood. As for heavy industry and national defense industry, they should be planned and constructed by the state as a whole. In short, developing the people's livelihood construction, increasing production, cultivating the people's strength today, and establishing the foundation for the vast national defense construction in the future. The reporter then asked about the progress of the implementation of the New County System. He said that what can be said at present is that those who do not need to lay the foundation for the implementation of the New County System are: (1) Initially training 100,000 cadres, including county officials at all levels, township chiefs, village chiefs, and principals and teachers of central national schools. (2) Improving the treatment of township chiefs and village chiefs. The village is the grassroots organization under the county's autonomous unit. If the village is to be healthy, the village chief must be capable and politically aware. To enable them to handle the affairs of a village well, their lives must be guaranteed so that they can concentrate on their work. At present, the salary of the township chief is more than 30 yuan per month, and the village chief will be stipulated to be 20 to 30 yuan. (2nd Dispatch)</p>

<p>Washington: According to well-informed sources, American policy remains the same as that announced by Secretary of State Hull weeks ago, with no changes. At that time, Hull explicitly announced that the United States wished to maintain the status quo in the Pacific. The Washington Post reported that Japan's true purpose is to control French Indochina and the Dutch East Indies, and its ultimate goal is even greater than this. Japan's adoption of this attitude is undoubtedly due to its belief in a Nazi victory and America's inability to do anything about it. A New York dispatch stated that when the day comes for a reckoning with the Axis powers, Japan will find itself in a very precarious position. The crimes that Japan will have to repent for may not initially be the great crime of violating international trust, but its words and deeds that run counter to human etiquette are also unforgivable. The people of other countries who have suffered from them will not allow their diplomats to forget them. For example, in the recent tragic death of Cox, Japan may be shocked to find that it cannot atone with Japanese yen. This is not only because Cox was in his prime, strong, personable, and had a wide circle of friends around the world, but also because Cox's tragic death is a clear indication that Japan has long used base methods of persecuting individuals as a tool of its policy. (Reuters dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: A Tokyo dispatch reports that after Konoe took office, he promoted a southern advance policy, and concrete measures are currently being discussed. During the Yonai cabinet, it was planned to send former ambassador to Poland, Shigemitsu Mamoru, as a special envoy to visit the Dutch East Indies. Konoe and Matsuoka believed that this matter was of great importance, and Shigemitsu's qualifications were not sufficient to handle the task satisfactorily. After consideration, there was an intention to replace him with Tsuda Shingo, the general manager of Kanegafuchi Spinning Co. Later, after thorough consultation with the army and navy, it was believed that the primary goal of the envoy to the Dutch East Indies this time was to investigate military matters, and a non-military expert would not be suitable. At the same time, there were concerns about causing terror in the Dutch East Indies and opposition from various countries. Therefore, it was decided to select former Minister of Colonial Affairs Koiso Kuniaki, hoping to conceal the purpose. Koiso is one of the strongest proponents of southern advance in the army. This spring, when answering questions from members of parliament, he repeatedly stated that Japan's future is greatly related to the South Seas. Koiso is not only related to colonial affairs but also a military tactics expert. His visit to the Dutch East Indies has the same meaning and effect as the visit of Naval Admiral Nomura Kichisaburo to the Philippines and Singapore. This can be said to be preparatory work for a determined southern advance. Koiso was traveling in Hokkaido when he received a telegram from Konoe, summoning him back to Tokyo. While in China, he made a statement to reporters, saying in essence, "Greater East Asia, including the South Seas, is a matter of course. The Dutch East Indies has been in a colonial status for a long time, and has been subjected to oppression and exploitation. From the perspective of building a new order in East Asia, we cannot allow it to retain its current state. In particular, resources such as oil, rubber, and tin are all essential for national defense and must be fairly distributed." From this, we can understand the intentions of Konoe, Matsuoka, and Koiso, and the "no change to the status quo" advocated by Yonai and Arita has been overturned by them. (Dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese newspapers welcomed the government's statement issued on the 1st of this month regarding the New Order in East Asia. However, they were all disappointed that the statement did not clarify Japan's policy towards the world. The "Nichinichi Shimbun" expressed regret that the government had not clarified Japan's current and future world policies, especially since Prime Minister Konoe had recently stated in a broadcast that he would draft Japan's policies towards all parties. The "Yomiuri Shimbun" stated that the new Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke had declared upon taking office that he would "emphasize action and not empty words" and used this as his political slogan, hoping that Matsuoka Yosuke would fulfill this slogan.

<p>Japan Changes Foreign Policy</p>
<p>United States Closely Watches Developments</p>
<p>Washington: People here generally believe that the remarks made by Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka regarding Japan's foreign policy have unmasked Japan's deceit and have refuted the statements made by former Foreign Minister Arita that Japan is eager to maintain the status quo in the Dutch East Indies. Washington acknowledges that this kind of shift on Japan's part is a major problem for the United States. Although Secretary of State Hull declined to comment on Matsuoka's remarks yesterday, saying that he had not yet received official information, the State Department is closely monitoring developments. Some radio news broadcasters believe that Japan is blindly advancing on a path to war against Britain or even against the United States. A radio station with 9 million listeners sarcastically commented on Matsuoka's remarks about "pleasing foreign countries," saying that "pleasing" is a new term in diplomacy. Considering that much of the turmoil in the Far East is due to Japan's failure to abide by treaty obligations, is pleasing perhaps a new term for abiding by treaties? People in Washington also expect that Japan's new policy is being promoted by Germany, as it has long been known here that Germany is making every effort to drag Japan into the war on the Axis side because it is clear that it has no chance of defeating Britain. However, many people still believe that Matsuoka's remarks are just for show and lack substance. After the empty threats regarding the Burma Road achieved the desired results, it is now intensifying its threats in a broader scope to obtain the same effect. (Reuters dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<p>Washington: Washington newspapers yesterday, based on the Cabinet's statement this week, called on the United States to accelerate the completion of national defense procedures. However, officials continue to refuse to comment on Japanese policy. Secretary of State Hull again refused to comment on Japan's announced "Greater East Asia" policy, saying that he had not received official reports regarding the Japanese statements and therefore could not criticize them. The Washington Star commented on the statement, urging the government to adopt mandatory military training to deal with the increasing threat from the East. The newspaper said that the policy indicates that Japan will take any necessary steps to expand the island nation to important regions, if Vietnam is indeed included, and added, "Japan is simply venting its true intentions to rule these areas, and its ambitions may be even greater than this." Japan's attitude may be due to America's weakness, because the attitude taken by the US Congress towards the military training proposal has made all aggressor nations feel that the United States will not resist in any way. The Washington Daily News published an editorial saying, "Japan's statement points out that the country's true intention is to establish rule in the Far East, as if the Japanese believe that Germany is creating Europe, and the United States is creating the Western Hemisphere. Apart from the difference in motives, Japan's intention to rule Asia is similar to America's intention to be the hegemon of the Americas, and Germany's desire to seize the reins of the European continent. The Soviet Union is another coalition, because its position is half in Europe and half in Asia. The distant British Empire is yet another coalition." (United Press dispatch from the 3rd)</p>

<p>Washington: Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Oumansky, visited the State Department yesterday at the invitation of US Under Secretary of State Welles. The contents of the talks were not announced, but reporters learned that Welles did not respond to the protest made by Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov to the Supreme Soviet regarding the prohibition of using the credit loans of the Baltic States in the United States. Observers believe that the two sides discussed the export licenses for machinery and other equipment purchased by the Soviet Union from the United States, but the goods have not been delivered due to the issuance of new license restrictions. Also the Maritime Commission's refusal to allow the Soviet Union to lease ships. It is generally believed that Welles also explained the new embargo on aircraft gasoline.

<p>Washington: The US Naval High Command declared to President Roosevelt that if the US goes to war with Japan, Japan may surrender within three weeks. According to a very reliable source speaking to (the interviewer claims), the US Navy stated that three weeks would be enough to sweep away the Japanese Navy, after which the Japanese Navy would have to choose between immediate surrender or slow destruction by blockade. US naval strategists are confident that Japan will implement the former. Roosevelt's determination to ban the export of aviation gasoline and first-class scrap iron and steel is an important factor due to his deep confidence in the US Naval Command. If the Japanese Navy is unwilling to risk war, it is deeply believed here that the US Navy will enter the China Sea and the Yellow Sea and force them to do so. No matter where the final battle takes place, US naval strategists predict that the United States will still have enough ships to blockade Japan, and even in case of emergencies, it will be able to dispatch several teams to the Atlantic Ocean and the Panama Canal. I know that last May, when the US Navy was not at its base in Honolulu, the US fleet was able to surround most of the Japanese Navy and defeat its naval force. At that time, the Japanese fleet was practicing in three groups near the Caroline and Marshall Islands under mandate. (International News Service dispatch from the 3rd)</p>

<p>London: Reuters has obtained information from responsible sources here that the heads of two prominent Japanese trading houses have been arrested by the authorities under the Defense Regulations. The two are Makihara, head of the London branch of Mitsubishi Corporation, and Tabe, acting head of the London branch of Mitsui &amp; Co. It is solemnly declared here that this action is by no means retaliation for the recent detention of British residents in Japan by the Japanese authorities. Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu visited the British Foreign Office today to inquire about the reasons for the arrest of the two Japanese residents. At the same time, the Japanese Embassy told Reuters that they are currently unable to make any comments. (Reuters dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<p>London: Reuters diplomatic correspondent has learned that Japanese Ambassador to Britain Shigemitsu visited the British Foreign Office before 1:00 PM to inquire about the arrest of the two Japanese residents. According to the Japanese Embassy, the two arrested have been in Britain for a long time and have always been known for paying attention to promoting Anglo-Japanese friendship and trade, and are both extremely upright people with many friends in Britain. The Embassy is quite puzzled by the British government's decision. Japanese sources are deeply concerned that this matter may have possible repercussions, especially at a time when relations between the two countries are in a "more than delicate" period. These sources have not made exaggerated comments to aggravate the problem, except for objective criticisms of the arrest of the two Japanese residents. (Reuters dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<p>London: Scotland Yard arrested Makihara, manager of the London branch of Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan, at his private residence at 8:00 PM last night, based on the British Defense Regulations. The Japanese side did not issue a formal statement last night, but authoritative sources stated that Makihara's arrest is consistent with the detention of British residents in Japan by the Japanese authorities. However, observers here speculate whether the arrest of Japanese residents in Britain indicates that Britain will retaliate against the arrest of British residents in Japan. Many foreigners have been arrested under the Defense Regulations. Makihara has been residing in London for a year. It is understood that the Japanese Embassy here immediately telegraphed the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs about Makihara's arrest. Japanese Ambassador to Britain Shigemitsu K. will also meet with British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax soon. (United Press dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<p>London: Japanese Ambassador to Britain Shigemitsu K. has made a strong representation to British Foreign Secretary Halifax regarding the British arrest of Japanese personnel. It is said that the Japanese Ambassador asked the Foreign Secretary why the Japanese were arrested. The Foreign Secretary replied that the arrest was the result of security considerations. I believe that this action has political implications, and I believe that this move is retaliation for Japan's arrest of British people. It is said that the Foreign Secretary also emphasized that this matter is purely a matter of internal legal authority, hoping that this move will not harm Anglo-Japanese friendship.

<p>London: The British Foreign Secretary told Japanese Ambassador to Britain Shigemitsu K. that he hopes that the Japanese side will quickly prove that the Japanese have not harmed British security. (United Press dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<p>London: The British government maintains strict silence on the arrest of the two Japanese businessmen. It is heard that the arrest of the Japanese was based on national security purposes and was carried out in accordance with the order to crack down on foreigners. A certain authoritative source stated that since the outbreak of the war, foreign nationals residing in Britain and other parts of the British Empire have been arrested from time to time under various regulations to protect national security, so the arrest of the Japanese is indeed possible. A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy said, "We are quite shocked by this move. We hope that everything can be resolved satisfactorily. The two Japanese who were arrested are both extremely pro-British and sympathetic to Britain. We really don't know of anything these two have done that violates British law or is suspected of doing so. I know these two very well, and their hearts are even more pro-British than the British." Furthermore, at 2:20 PM today, Japanese sources said that the Japanese side has not yet lodged a protest with the British Foreign Office. It is heard that the arrest of the Japanese was authorized by the British government to the Home Secretary Anderson, and was carried out in accordance with the order to crack down on foreigners under the National Defense Law. The detained Japanese are currently imprisoned in Brixton Prison. (United Press dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<p>London: Neutral sources here recently believed that Tokyo will definitely demand the immediate release of the two Japanese arrested last night. If they are not released, Anglo-Japanese relations may become dangerous. Although no information has been obtained from outside the closed-door meeting on foreign affairs in the House of Commons on Wednesday, it is heard that Prime Minister Churchill had predicted that the issue of Anglo-Japanese relations would be an important topic of debate in the closed-door meeting. It is heard that some prominent members of parliament are quite supportive of Britain's arrest of the Japanese. (United Press dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Chinese sources are now closely watching the news of the arrest of prominent Japanese businessmen in London, and interpreting this move as obviously a retaliation by Britain for the arrest of prominent British residents in Japan. The Chinese are more concerned about what kind of repercussions this British action will have on developments in the Far East, not just retaliation. It is generally believed that this will depend largely on what kind of action Tokyo will take in response. The development of Anglo-Japanese relations suggests the existence of several possibilities, namely, Britain abandoning its policy of appeasement towards Japan, and recognizing that continued concessions will increase Japan's pressure on British interests.

<p>London: British sources here yesterday claimed that there are German secret police officials within the Japanese Ministry of Home Affairs.

<p>Moscow: The second meeting of the joint session of the Soviet Union Council of the Union and Council of Nationalities was held yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM at the Kremlin. The meeting was as crowded as the first meeting. Stalin, Molotov, Voroshilov, Kalinin, Kaganovich, Mikoyan, Zhdanov, Khrushchev, Beria, Malenkov, Timoshenko, and Bagirov attended. The guests cheered Stalin and his comrades. The Chairman of the Council of Nationalities, Shvernik, announced the opening of the meeting and immediately discussed the second item on the agenda, the establishment of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic and the merger of Bessarabia and Bukovina regions. Konstantin Konstantinov, Chairman of the People's Commissariat of the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, made a speech, describing in detail the process by which Bessarabia was seized by Romanian nobles and British and French imperialists, and using facts to prove the poverty of the region under the rule of the Romanian authorities. He expressed satisfaction with the resolution of the Soviet-Romanian issue after twenty-two years. The resolution of this issue was facilitated by the wise diplomatic policy of the Soviet Union. Finally, he requested the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to accept the request of the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic and the people of the region to establish the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. Subsequently, Koenets, Chairman of the People's Commissariat of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, made a speech, expressing satisfaction that the resolution of the Soviet-Romanian dispute was considered to have eliminated historical injustices, and requesting the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to establish the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic and integrate Northern Bukovina and the Gutah, Akkerman, and Izmail districts of Bessarabia (mostly populated by Ukrainians) into the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. At this point, everyone stood up and congratulated the Bessarabia and Bukovina delegation, and shouted loudly.</p>
<p>When Kleinesgu, a female teacher from Bessarabia, took the stage, everyone responded with cheers. She thanked Stalin, Molotov, Voroshilov, Timoshenko, and the Soviet people on behalf of all the people of Bessarabia, and expressed that the people of Bessarabia were eager to reconnect with the people of Moldavia. Then, Mikhailchik, a worker from Northern Bukovina, also gave a speech and was very well received. He, representing the people of Northern Bukovina, requested the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to integrate Northern Bukovina into the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. At this time, amidst the cheers of the crowd, the Bessarabia and Bukovina delegation accepted the invitation of the Chairman and took their seats in the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Ukrainian scientist Starlingsky, a member of parliament, congratulated the people of Bessarabia and Bukovina on the integration of Bessarabia and Bukovina into the Soviet Union. Finally, the two councils</p>
<p>Voted separately</p>
<p>To pass the draft on the establishment of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic and the integration of Northern Bukovina and the Gutah, Akkerman, and Izmail districts of this province into the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. The passage of this motion was based on the wishes of the people of Bessarabia and the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic and the principle of free development of all ethnic groups. Also, the motion was proposed by Deputy Chairman of the People's Commissariat, Buganin. After the passage, everyone stood up again and applauded with prolonged and enthusiastic cheers.

<p>Washington – Mississippi Democratic Congressman Ford commented yesterday on the speech by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, saying that Molotov's diplomatic remarks, which stated that not only is Japan advancing toward an imperialistic path, but so is the United States, are essentially accusing us because of the recent Havana Declaration, which resolved that all American nations should jointly prevent European colonies in the Western Hemisphere from becoming victims of the European war. It is impossible for Molotov to call this action imperialism, as it is purely a simple measure of self-defense, issued for the benefit of the entire Americas. There is no doubt that the relationship between our country and the Soviet Union is cooling, but this is the result of the Soviet Union leaning towards the Axis powers, especially towards Germany, and the Soviet Union's unfair treatment of Finland, which has caused a tremendous reaction in the United States. As for the Soviet Union's claim that we are holding the deposits of the three Baltic states occupied by the Soviet Union, I believe this is the only fair measure, because Soviet troops marched into and occupied those lands, just as Germany occupied other countries. If we should protect the deposits of countries invaded by Germany, then we should naturally protect the deposits of countries invaded by the Soviet Union. Ford said that he knows that many people believe that the United States should cultivate friendship with the Soviet Union to guard against the possibility of the United States being invaded by Japan or the Axis powers, or even a joint attack by them. However, I believe that as far as the Soviet Union is concerned, we may be able to establish friendship with its government in one week, but once it is in their interest, we will become enemies again in the second week.

<p>Turkey</p>
<p>Ankara - In Turkish political circles, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech is viewed as a cautious and statesmanlike report on foreign policy, without any change in Soviet-Turkish relations. However, the official TASS translation stated, "Recent documents disclosed by the German side have revealed some traces of activities developing within Turkish territory," which was translated into German as "unpleasant activities have been discovered on the part of certain figures in Turkey." People here were deeply stimulated by this, believing that Germany is now attempting to slander Turkish politicians such as Saracoğlu, whom it has always wanted to harm. (Reuters dispatch of the 3rd)</p>
<p>Ankara - The opinion of many political observers here is that Molotov's speech on Thursday indicated that, on the one hand, he is using cooperation with Germany as a cover to increase self-defense preparations, and on the other hand, he is waiting for an opportunity. Stalin and Molotov both feel that regardless of whether Hitler's attack on England succeeds or even materializes, the Soviet Union must be prepared to defend its own interests. The general sentiment in Turkey is that Molotov's speech has opened the door for improved relations between England and the Soviet Union, and if the two countries are willing to do so, they can proceed.

<p>Germany</p>
<p>Berlin – A certain spokesperson for the German Foreign Office issued a comment yesterday regarding the speech by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, saying that Molotov has clearly declared the relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union, leaving no room for misinterpretation. Molotov has criticized the British attempts to undermine German-Soviet relations. The British are using newspaper propaganda and diplomatic conspiracies to split German-Soviet relations, their purpose being nothing more than to profit from it. From Molotov's speech, it can be seen that Soviet Russia is also paying close attention to the creation of a new order in Southeastern Europe. Although the relationship between Soviet Russia, Germany, and Italy is still developing along a natural path due to the enemy's sabotage. (Haitong Press)</p>

<p>Rome – Responsible figures here stated yesterday that Italy is quite interested in the speech by the Soviet Foreign Minister, but the general public in Italy holds a reserved attitude towards the section of the speech concerning Soviet-Italian relations. (Haitong Press dispatch of the 3rd)</p>
<p>Rome - Political circles here generally expect that Italian-Soviet relations can be improved. It is generally believed that Molotov's speech, which repeatedly stated that Italian-Soviet relations are good, is sufficient to show that the portion of the Balkan problem involving the Soviet Union has been completely resolved. At least for the moment, the differences of opinion between the two countries regarding the Southeast European issue have been satisfactorily resolved. Some people even believe that Molotov's speech may lead to an increase in commerce between Italy and the Soviet Union and between Germany and the Soviet Union, which is of particular importance to Germany and Italy. Political circles here also believe that Molotov's speech is an open expression of permission to improve Italian-Soviet relations. Some people speculate that the German-Italian Axis may have the possibility of close cooperation with the Soviet Union and Japan. Political circles also recall that Italy was the first European country to recognize the Soviet Union, and has always pursued a practical policy in its commercial and diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, never mixing elements of political philosophy into it.

<p>Vichy – The French newspaper "L'Intransigeant" declared that Daladier and General Gamelin were the main culprits of the French military disaster, because Daladier was the person who decided to declare war on Germany, and General Gamelin said that France had been fully prepared for several months when the German army began its attack on May 10, causing the entire country to be plunged into a military disaster and the people to suffer death and displacement. In fact, France was completely unprepared. Daladier and Gamelin ignored warnings about the situation at the front, and the French military headquarters did not replenish the ammunition in various places according to the original plan in the seven months after the declaration of war. To the soldiers, they said that the Maginot Line was as solid as a rock, causing 50% of the French soldiers to have the illusion that they could win without fighting, resulting in today's complete defeat.

The newspaper said that Mandel's actions cannot save a certain fate, as the military court is already investigating his crimes. As for his article, it has been publicly announced, and its content roughly states that de Gaulle, as a soldier, fled abroad during the war, and dared to repeatedly make broadcast speeches in London, making illegal propaganda, and colluding with foreign countries, instigating French soldiers to no longer be loyal to their own country but to serve foreign countries.

<p>Vichy - Due to the scarcity of gasoline in France, the authorities in several provinces have separately adopted various measures to restrict the civilian use of automobiles and other vehicles that consume gasoline. From the 25th of this month, all provinces will uniformly implement these measures to conserve gasoline. Vehicles using other fuels may still pass freely, without any restrictions. According to the restriction measures formulated by various provinces, people who have not obtained a special permit are not allowed to use automobiles. Those who apply for permits must have legitimate reasons. Doctors and those responsible for transporting food will naturally enjoy priority. Regarding this matter, the Minister of Industrial Production and Labor, Peyrouton, recently told a Havas News Agency reporter that the country needs 200,000 tons of gasoline per month, but the total amount of gasoline currently stored in the free zone and the occupied zone is only 240,000 tons, so it is imperative to conserve gasoline. However, the government will still take various measures to ensure that civilians can still obtain gasoline supplies when transporting food and harvesting crops, and that certain public utilities can still be maintained. As for the restriction measures, one of the most important aspects is to implement a consistent restriction method in both the free zone and the occupied zone, without distinction. (Note: The German army has already implemented restrictions in the occupied zone). In addition, the Ministry of Labor is currently making every effort to import gasoline from abroad, and the government is negotiating with a certain country's government to allow oil tankers to freely sail to France. At the same time, the German authorities have also allowed gasoline and kerosene to be transported to France without being requisitioned. (Havas dispatch of the 2nd)</p>

<p>London - British Prime Minister Churchill invited the famous British publisher Lord Beaverbrook to join his War Cabinet last night. However, Beaverbrook is still serving as Minister of Aircraft Production at this time. This situation foreshadows that the cabinet will soon be reshuffled, and that the former Prime Minister during the last European War, Lloyd George, may take on a position.

<p>Moscow - The Soviet newspaper "Red Star" published a commentary today titled "Air War," stating, "Since the surrender of France, the European war has entered a new stage. The belligerent countries are now separated by the Strait, so the German side cannot utilize its army advantage. On the other hand, the British side cannot take offensive action due to the weakness of its army. Currently, both sides are concentrating all their efforts on the air war. Britain, fearing the power of the German air force, has concentrated its efforts on attacking the German oil production base, so that the German air force cannot develop its power. However, the British side is suffering from the difficulty of having the will but lacking the strength. Up to now, the German air force has only bombed various ports in southeastern England, with the aim of forcing the British navy to leave, so as to facilitate the German army's landing. Currently, the air force power of Germany actually exceeds that of Britain, but if the United States can supply aircraft to Britain every month, then the British strength can be on par with Germany. From this perspective, Germany will inevitably use its current air force advantage to attack England. The outcome of the Anglo-German war will largely depend on who wins the air victory."

<h3 id="e43">Anglo-Italian Naval and Air War in the Eastern Mediterranean, British Convoys Repeatedly Attacked by Italian Aircraft, Large Italian Army in Libya Assembled on the Egyptian Border <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Alexandria - According to investigation reports, the Anglo-Italian Mediterranean war has now formed a war of battleships against enemy aircraft, and the result is that battleships have the advantage. The British fleet in the eastern Mediterranean is often attacked by Italian aircraft while patrolling for Italian ships. However, there have been no reports of British ships being hit. When Italian aircraft attack, bullets rain down, and the artillery fire from British ships is like ten thousand fire dragons rushing into the sky, forcing Italian aircraft to attack from a very high altitude. Moreover, British convoys, even when attacked by Italian submarines, can safely pass through the areas where submarines and mines are located. According to an eyewitness who spoke to a reporter, more than a hundred Italian aircraft flew in formation yesterday to attack British ships, first concentrating on one British ship, and then bombing other ships. (United Press dispatch of the 3rd)</p>
<p>London - A Reuters military correspondent said that according to news from the Libyan-Egyptian border, the Italian side is now assembling a large army in that area, mostly near Sollum. Now that France has ceased hostilities, the Italian side does not need to worry about the Tunisian border, so it can transfer a large army to the Libyan-Egyptian border. The British army is harassing the Italian army as it assembles. Sollum only has a small barracks and a shallow port, and cannot berth ocean-going ships, so it has little strategic importance. The area occupied by the British army there is larger than expected. The Sheferzeny fort outpost is still holding out. Although the British army is outnumbered, its spirit of resistance can be seen everywhere. (Reuters dispatch of the 3rd)</p>
<p>Rome - According to the Italian military headquarters, reliable sources say that Italian aircraft bombed the Haifa oil depot, and the fire has not been extinguished for three days.

British military garages near Konya and Bona were bombed. In North Africa, enemy aircraft attacked Bardia, killing several soldiers, but the damage was minimal. Two enemy aircraft were shot down while attacking the Cagliari airfield. The pilot of one of them was captured. Enemy aircraft only killed one person and injured three, and the damage was minimal.

<p>New York - Observers here speculate that Hitler's expected lightning attack on England is increasingly imminent, as the American Radio Association announced that communications with Bordeaux, under German occupation, have been "temporarily cut off from noon onwards." Earlier this week, the German authorities in the occupied area of France cut off all telephone, telegraph, and postal communications with the occupied area of France. Yesterday, news from Grenoble said that the German army in the occupied area of France was advancing from the Spanish border towards Belgium. It is widely believed that this army is being transferred to northern France, as that is the coast facing England. (United Press dispatch of the 3rd)</p>

<h3 id="e46">Military and Civilian Cooperation to Resist Aggression, England's Defense Is Strong, Secret Coastal Forts Dotted Like Stars, Paratroopers Landing Will Not Be Difficult to Annihilate <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>London - A Reuters correspondent inspected defenses from the Wash River to the Tyne River, a journey of a thousand miles. It is said that tens of thousands of armed workers in northern England have joined the Home Guard, receiving training and exercises with the regular army for ten weeks, and are now ready to repel the enemy. A senior staff officer told reporters that the Home Guard and the regular army support each other and are closely connected. If necessary, the Home Guard will join the battlefield. The Home Guard does not need to be transferred with other troops. Their job is to defend their own homes, villages, and towns when the enemy is pressing in. The regular army's main purpose is to move quickly. Civilian vehicles have been requisitioned to provide rapid transportation for the army. The reporter witnessed an exercise to defeat paratroopers. Both the army and the air force participated in the performance. Assuming that the airfield is the target of the enemy paratroopers, troops are stationed around the airfield. At the first alarm signal, armed vehicles rush to the scene, and there is no gap to take advantage of in the barrage of gunfire. The enemy is quickly eliminated. The army also has strict preparations in place along the coast. Secret forts are everywhere. At first glance, they are purely natural scenery, but in reality, defensive works are within them, but they are heavily disguised. The technique is novel and unnoticed. Therefore, General Adam, commander-in-chief of the North, is confident that the military and civilians in the North will be able to cope with any attack by the enemy.</p>
<p>Another Reuters correspondent returned from an inspection of the east, saying that ground defenses in the east have been greatly strengthened in the past few weeks. The Home Guard is now responsible for important work in the inland river defenses. They patrol constantly, so the main defense, commanded by naval officers and composed of a mix of naval and land forces, can focus all its efforts on the area where the enemy appears. The reporter saw their exercises. This type of team can board small boats within 30 seconds and travel at a speed of 30 nautical miles per hour to the place of battle. The Home Guard is responsible for reconnaissance, often patrolling with three or four people in a boat. However, the army still bears the heavy responsibility of defending the east. According to the commander, the troop strength is increasing day by day, and it will be difficult for the enemy to succeed. Even if the number of invaders is large and they have the help of the sky, they will all be annihilated. A certain racetrack has now been requisitioned for military use, and alarm drills are often held. At the sound of the alarm, the motorcade sets out, and within a few minutes, all important points in the area are guarded by troops as if facing a great enemy. (Reuters dispatch of the 3rd)</p>

Two minutes later, another enemy plane came to attack, dropping bombs on the SS Harlette, hitting the deck.

The committee members of the Social Education Promotion Committee of the Normal College inspected it from time to time. The scale was roughly in place, and the work was underway. First, the teachers and students of the Normal College, deeply concerned that Lantian was remote and the people were poor, and that many people were out of school, urgently planned to set up two people's schools to provide relief. In addition, a worker-police literacy class was established in the college. All regular expenses were donated by the staff, and the students of the college served as teachers. Since then, it has been merged into the People's Education Center, and all expenses are provided by the center. Currently, the center's annual funding is set at 8,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The center, from the director and deputy director downwards, is divided into four groups: general affairs, instruction, livelihood, and recreation.

Registration of old students and supplementary enrollment of new students will be handled from now on. It is reported that the school only charges one yuan per semester, and books and supplies are provided by the school, so the number of students applying will inevitably be very crowded.

Today's competition will continue, and the program will be even more exciting. It is expected that it will attract more spectators. However, there are not many tickets for sale, so you must take your seat as soon as possible. In the Samsung-Jianbei match, after Yuan opened the ball, the two sides fought in the middle field. The situation was tense. Wu Shaotai took the lead in the strict defense of Jianbei and scored the first goal, thus taking the lead with a score of 1-0 in the first half. After changing sides, Samsung's Wu Shaotai and Zhu Weizhong scored successively to make it 3-0. Jianbei's Ye Yiting worked hard to pull back a goal. At the end of the match, the whistle sounded for a long time, and Samsung won with a score of 3-1. Lianyi, which emerged as a dark horse, made its debut yesterday.

In the A-level Group 1 match between Liangxi and Shanghai Youth, it was still the first round. Shanghai Youth's morale has been slightly dampened since its defeat to Qunyi last week. Although the main general Sun Damiao played with injuries yesterday, he fought hard. However, Liangxi's momentum was overwhelming. Liang Yunming and Zhang Liangxiong were accurate in their shots. As a result, Liangxi defeated Shanghai Youth 70-58. In the first half, Liangxi also took the lead with a score of 34-23. There will be two matches starting at 5:30 pm today. In Group 2, Shangxing will meet Nanyang. Shangxing has a brilliant record. The student army of Nanyang is probably not its opponent. In Group 2, Bai Le Men will meet Qifan again. Qifan defeated Youlian the day before yesterday. Today, it may pose a serious threat to the ever-victorious army. The results of yesterday's A-level matches are as follows:</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Amateur Sports Association has been holding free strengthening exercises to promote mass sports, the number of people who have signed up to participate has been very enthusiastic in recent days. The association originally set a limit of 500 participants. Now it has exceeded 1,000. They have to be divided into two groups to practice. However, because the original borrowed venue is not enough, they have changed to Guangxia Middle School on Fuxu Road and Moore Road and requested to borrow the school's playground. They have been generously approved. The first group will be allowed to start practicing from today. Mr. Zha Ruilong will personally come to the venue every day to provide free guidance. Anyone who is interested in participating can still go to the association's office at 512 Tianjin Road to sign up and receive a free physical examination.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed price. The black market for British and American currencies saw fluctuating tight and loose conditions, and the trend seemed unstable. This was due to uneven steps taken by operators. After the morning opening, speculators continued to buy, but American banks were full of supply intentions, and the market was not affected at all. Moreover, soon Chinese and Japanese banks came to sell, resulting in a hard underlying trend. However, after 10:45 am, foreign banks slightly settled accounts, and sellers took the opportunity to raise prices, so the market softened again. By the afternoon close, there was no relaxation. As a result, British gold was 3 shillings 8 1/25 pence, and the American exchange rate was 5 yuan 8 1/25, equal to the previous day's British rate. The American rate was reduced by 0.03125. Futures and spot prices continued to converge. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Slightly Tightening of American Exchange Futures and Spot Prices</p>
<p>In the early morning, London's long-term bills were flat for both near and far terms. New York silver prices remained unchanged, and London gold prices were fixed.

After the opening, speculators were the first to buy, but American banks were quite willing to supply, and the market was stable. It is estimated that the American bank sold American exchange rates for the current month to speculators at 5 yuan 8.4375, and also sold American exchange rates for September to Zhejiang Industrial Bank at 5 yuan 7.8125. HSBC's listed price was announced and remained unchanged. The silver balance tax was announced and also remained unchanged. After this, speculators slightly sold off, and Japanese and Chinese banks all had intentions to sell, resulting in a hard underlying trend. It is estimated that the Chinese bank sold American exchange rates for August to speculators at 5 yuan 8.75, and the Japanese bank sold the same month's American exchange rates to foreign banks, all at 5 yuan 8.75. At that time, the most commonly seen spot price for shillings was 3 shillings 8.4375. By 10:45 am, foreign banks suddenly had slight account settlements. It is estimated that American exchange rates for August from American and Chinese banks etc. settling with foreign banks were 5 yuan 8.4375 and 8.125. Prices had softened. By the close of noon, there was no change. British gold was 3 shillings 8.125 pence, and the American exchange rate was 5 yuan 8.125, the same price as the current month.

<h3 id="e60">Major Players Shorting the Market, Gold Market Once Plummets <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's black market for immediate delivery of gold bars saw prices unable to rise. Although people's hearts were stable, there were many floating households selling, and there was a lack of support when prices fell. Supply and demand were difficult to balance, so prices were weak. Although the exchange market eventually tightened, it was ultimately difficult to boost the gold market. The morning opened at 5,510 yuan, and the price rose to 5,525 yuan due to gold dealers buying. However, at this time, a certain money exchange suddenly turned short on behalf of a major player, and gold and silver dealers sold at high prices, immediately pushing the price down to 5,460 yuan. After a long period of hovering, gold and money exchange dealers bought back a lot, and it was heard that the foreign exchange market had softened, causing a slight buying trend. The price rose to 5,515 yuan. The noon close was 5,510 yuan, a slight decrease of 15 yuan compared to the previous day. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday. About one thousand several hundred taels were traded in half a day. Silver jewelry first fell, then returned to flat. Customs gold etc. remained fixed.</p>
<p>The Fall in Immediate Delivery of Gold Bars Was Very Slight</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the morning, the price per bar (ten taels) opened at 5,510 yuan, because the exchange rate was reported as flat, and people's hearts were slightly frustrated, which was 15 yuan lower. The money exchange sold 20 taels to the silver dealer for 5,510 yuan. At this time, the silver dealer helped the gold dealer to buy, and the price once rose by 15 yuan. Silver dealers traded dozens of taels among themselves for 5,525 yuan. Then, because two money exchanges tended to sell off, and soon the exchange market slightly tightened, gold and silver dealers also sold, which once plummeted to a low price of 5,460 yuan. Fortunately, later, a certain money exchange took advantage of the low price to cover the short position, and the price rose back to the edge of the 5,500 yuan mark. Although the silver dealer sold off, causing the price to plummet to 5,475 yuan, eventually the softening of the exchange market caused a considerable buying trend. The silver dealer and the money exchange etc. bought, and the high price of 5,515 yuan was seen again at noon. However, a certain money exchange sold again before the close, so the market closed at 5,500 yuan. As a result, the price was 15 yuan lower than the previous day. The underlying trend was tight and stable after the close, and there were transactions at 5,515 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday. There was only a fluctuation of 65 yuan in half a day. The selling price of cash gold dealers' own-brand gold was a dozen yuan higher than that of immediate delivery gold bars, and the purchase price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were few openings for transactions.</p>
<p>The Price of Jewelry Gold Wanted to Fall but Went Back Up Again</p>
<p>The initial price of jewelry gold per tael for sale by silver shops was still 570 yuan, the same as that of Datong Bank. At 10:20 am, the price dropped by 10 yuan. At 11:45 am, the price rose by 10 yuan. After that, there were no changes. As a result, the price of Datong Bank was still 570 yuan. The price of the new bank was the same as the above price, and the purchase price was reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Foreign Currency Prices Fluctuating <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw fluctuating prices for immediate delivery of gold bars, so the market prices of British and American gold pounds also rose and fell irregularly, eventually remaining flat. The supply and demand of British gold notes was even, and the market price was stable. The American gold note price rose and fell suddenly, eventually increasing by three points. The trend of Hong Kong notes was still good, and the market price continued to rise by one point. The demand for Japanese gold notes was increasingly strong, and the market price continued to rise widely. The evening price was as high as 1 yuan 2 jiao 8 fen. The supply and demand of Korean notes was very even, and the market price remained flat. The evening price was still 1 yuan 0 jiao 9 fen and a half.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Near and Far Term Bills Flat <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The London telegram on the 2nd reported that the silver market saw near and far term bills flat and unchanged, with little trading and a stable market. The market trend remained stable after the close. A New York telegram reported that the price of American silver remained unchanged. A Bombay telegram reported that the price of Indian silver was slightly higher by two annas for both current and futures terms, with a fairly stable market. There were a total of 75 transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Discount Rate Unchanged <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for exchange bills was the same as the final price of the previous day: a discount price of 45 yuan per thousand for discount purchases and 47 yuan for discount sales. The Shanghai Money Trade Association's interbank lending rate dropped another point, with a price of 1 jiao 6 fen in both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Securities: Domestic Debt Firm and Stable, Broker License Fees Surge <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The securities gray market saw strong demand for Class A bonds yesterday, and Class D bonds also found buyers. Other bond types were similarly boosted, leading to a generally stronger market. Class A bonds were buoyed by the approaching lottery and increased number of prizes, while Class D bonds, with their extremely limited float, experienced a shortage even with modest demand. Previously, Class C bonds were valued at around one yuan more than Class A, but now they are priced equally, raising hopes of Class C bonds increasing in value. While the overall environment remains in a period of gestation, general confidence is very strong, with only the timing being in question. It has been noted that stock exchange licenses (i.e., the right to be a licensed broker), which cost between five thousand and ten thousand yuan in March and April of last year for both new and old licenses, have now surged to over twenty thousand to over thirty thousand yuan. Therefore, rumors are circulating that the stock exchange will soon reopen. Yesterday's trading continued to show a steady upward trend, with No. 16 accumulating particularly large quantities of Class D bonds, and significant absorption of Class A bonds. The Great Completion Company also accumulated a significant amount of Class A bonds, further depleting the supply of these two types. Renchang, Xinfu, Hengfu, Hongda, and Lianyi all made purchases. Although Jiufeng consistently sold, and Xiexingyuan released some, and Tongkang and Xinchang also sold, the market atmosphere still favored buyers. As a result, prices rose across the board by two to four and a half jiao. The total transaction volume was approximately over nine hundred thousand yuan. A summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>London, 2nd (Friday) Cable: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks were generally calm. Only the Mercantile Bank shares continued to fall by three shillings and nine pence, priced at six pounds and fifteen shillings. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Grain: Rice Prices Rise Again <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot rice market saw very strong buying interest. Merchants took the opportunity to raise prices, with constant calls for higher bids. In addition, floating and retail buyers actively traded, further stirring up the market, making the situation increasingly lively. In the central market, prices rose by one yuan in an instant, and then continued to rise, with closing prices one to two yuan higher than the previous market. No. 1 Chen Saigon was 58 yuan, No. 2 was 52 yuan, No. 1 Wan Siam was 56 yuan, Special was 57 yuan, No. 2 was 51 yuan, Fire-milled was 57 yuan, Hong Kong Grade was 55-56 yuan, Small Grade was 52.5 yuan, 52 yuan, Tokyo Grade was 48.5 yuan, Finished was 46 yuan, Rough Grade was 44 yuan, Broken Grade was 43.5 to 41.6 yuan, Rice Green was 44-45 yuan. Original packages being resold immediately upon arrival, as well as goods on the way, were bought up by Mitsui &amp; Co. for 300 tons, preparing to ship them to Yantai. Inland buyers also followed the market and absorbed supplies. Sellers drove up prices, with Saigon No. 2 and Siam No. 2 rice seeing increases of over two yuan. The asking price for Saigon No. 2 immediately jumped to 60 yuan, then from 60.05 yuan to 61.3 yuan. Siam No. 2 opened at 60 yuan, then rose to 61 yuan, and in the afternoon market, prices were called as high as 61.5 yuan. Saigon opened at 50 yuan, and small-milled original packages also reached 60 yuan. The situation is very good. If actual sales do not decline in the next few days, the market should be able to turn around. If our existing stock is sufficient, and exports are minimal, it will be difficult to raise prices excessively.</p>
<p>The arrival of Japonica and glutinous domestic rice remains scarce, with only six to seven hundred bags in total. Gray market trading is rumored to be as active as imported rice, so selling prices are being pushed up by sellers across the board. Glutinous rice is particularly sought after due to its scarcity and flavor, with a two-yuan increase. Kaijin Litte Special is 61 yuan, 60 yuan, Changdan goods are 58-59 yuan, Hong Kong goods are 60 yuan. Japonica rice is only slightly better, Changbang Fresh Clean Japonica is 67 yuan, Wuxi Clean Japonica is 66 yuan, Changzhou Su-Kun Japonica is 64-65 yuan, Finished is 62 yuan, Qing Si Thin Rice is 65-66 yuan, Nangang Early Rice original package is 63.5 yuan, By-the-bushel is around 60 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Japanese Flour Rampant, Sales of Domestic Flour Decline <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market remained firm. The No. 2 Flour Mill's listing remained at the original price of 15 yuan. Retail sales to domestic customers were still relatively strong, especially for Japanese flour, which sold even more briskly due to its lower price and convenient shipping in the current environment. Therefore, buyers from Yantai and Weihaiwei were all purchasing Japanese flour, and domestic merchants also purchased Japanese flour due to its low price, leading to a brisk market. The opening price for August is rumored to be 14.2 yuan, and for September 14.65 yuan, an increase of 1.5 to 2 jiao from the previous day. The total transaction volume was around 20,000 bags. Transactions for Chinese flour also increased to over 6,000 bags.</p>
<p>New arrivals of wheat from Zhabei and other places are mostly being held back in anticipation of stronger flour prices. Japanese and Chinese mills are gradually increasing their buying, with prices for high-grade wheat rising by 5-6 jiao. Japanese mills purchased 5-6,000 bags, and Chinese mills purchased over 2,000 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Yarn and Cotton: Manufacturers Release Large Quantities, Weak Yarn Market <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market remains firm, and most retail buyers are optimistic, believing that the foreign exchange rate will continue to fall, so they are all buying. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was sharp, exceeding the 1,000 yuan mark. However, manufacturers sold off all of the quantity they had previously been supporting in the market, flattening the table somewhat. However, confidence remains good.</p>
<p>Due to the continued depreciation of exchange rates since yesterday afternoon, the opening price for spot yarn this morning jumped above the 1,000 yuan mark, at 1,005 yuan. However, buying interest remained strong. Unexpectedly, the Shenxin Mill sold off large quantities at market price, easing supply and causing prices to fall back to 992 yuan. However, some people remained firm and bought again at the lower price, causing prices to rebound to around 1,000 yuan. Statistics show that 2,355 bales were traded in half a day. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 2 yuan. The amounts purchased by various groups are listed on the left.</p>

<p>Spot cotton trading is slightly active, but no large-scale transactions have yet developed. This is because of concerns that foreign cotton and new cotton buds may fall in price, so everyone is keeping a low profile. Although Shanghai's cotton inventory is not strong, there should be no problems in meeting demand until the new harvest arrives. The current spot cotton situation is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Dazhong Assemblage 202.00 Tong Xiajin 101 bales</p>
<p>Also 202.00 Also 153 bales</p>
<p>Fire Grass bale 152.00 Yuancheng Jin 300 bales</p>
<p>Also 151.00 Xiehe Jin 240 bales</p>
<p>Dazhong Assemblage 207.00 Hongzhang Jin 400 bales</p>
<p>In other news, for the foreign cotton market, New York cotton market conditions are calm and firm. Later, due to purchases by spot merchants and some short covering, the closing price rose by one or two pounds compared to the previous day. India, including forecasts, fell by three or four rupees.</p>
<p>The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai is unusually quiet. Exchange rates have tightened again, and people are unmoved. Mills are also unusually quiet. Although Japanese manufacturers have intentions to buy, their counterparts are unwilling to make forward silver transactions anymore.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Miscellaneous Grains: Broad Bean Supply Continues, Creating Oversupply <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the broad bean market situation, previously influenced by the listing of new goods and monopolization, led to rising confidence, assuming that the arrival of goods from all parties could not be strong, and the market must increase more than decrease. Therefore, it once took advantage of the trend to drag in. Unexpectedly, the source female is not crowded, but still continuously. However, sales in various gangs are instead declining, thus turning into a situation of oversupply. At present, although there are about 10,000 bags of various broad beans in Shanghai, sales are slow, making it difficult for potential to rise. Yesterday, only this street handled more than one hundred and thirty bags of Qing Broad Beans from Maojia City.</p>
<p>The price is 18 yuan to 17.8 jiao.</p>
<p>For miscellaneous grain exports, on the 4th, there were 1,690 bags of beans shipped to Singapore, 1,000 pieces of bean cake shipped to Singapore, and 1,000 bags of raw peanuts shipped to Singapore.</p>

<p>The cloth market continued to rise. Domestic customers are inclined to buy, and sales to the southwest are still strong. The mills are gradually raising their prices, which has further aroused bullish sentiment. Yesterday, white goods and bleached cloth rose by another 2.5 to 5 jiao per bolt. Over 1,000 pieces of various goods were traded on this street. The Guangdong and Hong Kong dealers wholesaled over 200 pieces of Luen Cheong colored cloth. Various factory colored cloth and colored twill goods were traded for over 300 pieces. A certain gang handled two hundred and several tens of pieces. Wenzhou dealers handled over 300 pieces of Yihe and Shenxin fine cloth, twill, coarse cloth, and Luen Cheong colored cloth. Sichuan and Yunnan dealers handled over one hundred pieces of colored cloth and fine cloth. However, sales in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang guerrilla areas have turned sluggish, and there are few purchases from the north.</p>
<p>The bundled cloth market continued to rise. The opening price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth this morning was 30.085 yuan, falling back to 30.067 yuan mid-way. Later, due to very smooth buying from counterparts and speculators, it rose again to 31.1 yuan. Four Gentlemen serge rose to 9 jiao, 1 fen, 2 li and a half. Mid-range fine cloth and fine twill rose by about 2.5 jiao per bolt.</p>
<p>For exports, on the 4th, 80 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Singapore, and 125 pieces were shipped to Yantai.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Broadcloth Market Sales Quiet <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The broadcloth market has always been quiet. Sales of all goods have decreased without exception. The summer selling season has passed, and most merchants have already aired out their goods to prevent mildew. Many white goods have been stored away in packages. As for autumn and winter goods, street sales are dependent on the weather, and all are waiting. Due to the situation, long-distance sales are becoming difficult to execute. Therefore, at present, retail sales of various broadcloth are quite sluggish, and wholesale and retail business are both unusually quiet.</p>

<p>New dried lily flowers from various producing areas have gradually appeared on the market. However, due to the special situation in the north, procedures are numerous. We cannot load out, so transportation is slow. It is heard that yesterday, a merchant shipped sixteen pieces of dried lily flowers from Xuzhou as express mail, selling them for 95 yuan. Also, the first batch of four pieces of Daxing vegetables arrived. The strips are plump and even, and the color is also good. They were immediately sold for 110 yuan. It has been noted that the existing stock of old vegetables will soon be exhausted, and the situation is stable.</p>

<p>Most broadcloth orders for woolen fabrics pass through the hands of foreign firms. These firms negotiate orders with overseas manufacturers, issuing formal order documents to domestic merchants. As a result, there was a proliferation of foreign firms engaged in the broadcloth business, but there have been significant changes over the decades. A review of the changes between the old and new eras follows.</p>
<p>In the old days, most of the broadcloth ordering firms in Shanghai were British. They were followed by German, American, and French firms. The oldest brands were Rongtai, Hamley, Shunfa, Houchi, Hefeng, Taihe, Deki, Huaji, Gongping, Lihe, Yihe, Haohua, Gongyi, Shunquanlong, and Sassoon. Next came Lulin, Xinji, Melchers, Rothlis, Xingtai, Siemsen, Tianyou, Kangfu, Consul, Lin Nan, Anli, and Yiji. Later, as the sales of broadcloth increased, local Shanghai wholesale merchants emerged, and the number of Chinese and Japanese firms increased year by year. Chinese merchants included Ningfeng, Zhaofeng, Yongfeng, Dafeng, Dakang, Hongsheng, Lieyan, Yongfei, Hualun, Yongtai, Yonghe, Meifa, Youyi, Xiankang, Rongkang, Wushuang, Yuankang, Huafu, and Meijin. Japanese trading companies included Mitsui, Iwai, Yoshida, Abeichi, Ito, Yiji, Renchang, Renyu, and Cohen. Polish wholesale firms included Manhai, Shili Luo, Ruiwen, Huabo, Baoda, Xinkang, and Baodali. At the same time, the number of British, French, German, Italian, Swiss, and Dutch trading houses engaged in ordering also increased daily, including Tianxiang, Baoduo, Laipei, Yani, Changsheng, Zhengchang, Ruikang, Lao Mao, Hengli, Tianfu, Yongxing, Lixing, Shike, Yongle, Tianfeng, Changtai, Miye, Shende, Rende, Dehuali, Yiyi, Jinhai, Fulong, Dongfang, Zhonghua, Lifeng, Haoshi, Yide, Maigao, and Lijisheng, Pengdemen, etc. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e76">Metals: Raw Copper Sluggish, Prices Soft <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The long-quiet market for raw brass remains without improvement. Due to sluggish sales of copper sheets, copper factories on this street have sharply reduced their purchases of raw materials. Currently, the only buyers are sand-casting factories and scattered retail customers. Wholesale business is very lacking. Confidence is soft, and the market is easing. The current asking price is around 120 yuan, a further drop of 5 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Cement Market Prices Plunge <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>In the cement market, which has been rising for a long time, recently due to few construction projects in this street, the demand for cement is very small. Transactions are only between retail stores and scattered buyers. Seeing this phenomenon, merchants' sentiment has softened, and the standards of all goods have fallen by 4-5 yuan each. For example, white cement is selling for 95 yuan per barrel, and Horse brand cement is selling for 50 yuan per barrel.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Medicine: Dried Lily Bulbs Rise <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Dried lily bulbs are seeing delayed new arrivals, and inventories in the Shanghai market are gradually running short, so prices are gradually rising. Ordinary goods have risen to 34-35 yuan, and specially selected clean large pieces are 40 yuan. However, it is reported that new goods from the producing area have already appeared on the market and will arrive in Shanghai soon.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Honeysuckle Rebounds Sharply <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The price of honeysuckle previously fell by 10-20 yuan due to the Hong Kong gang temporarily stopping purchases. However, recently, the source is scarce, and various gangs have followed up to purchase. Existing inventories are gradually running low, so it has been rising steadily. The momentum is very strong, rising from 90 yuan to 120 yuan, and it is expected to continue to rise.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Consular Body Appeals to Municipal Council: Definite Response Expected Next Week; Content to Remain Confidential <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>In light of the need to suppress terror activities in the Settlement, and at the invitation of the Council Chairman, Mr. Cornell, the Consular Body convened meetings on the 25th of last month and again on the day before yesterday. Meeting details were closely guarded, and specific recommendations were not revealed. An announcement was issued after meetings adjourned. It is understood that the letter the Consular Body is preparing to send the Council will not be published after receipt but treated as a secret communication. In addition, it has been discovered that the resolutions adopted by the Consular Body meetings were carefully worded, and any language containing serious political implications has been removed.</p>
<p>Reuters, Shanghai, 3rd: According to a reliable source, references made in the morning papers of August 3rd regarding the August 2nd Consular Body meeting and official accounts given to the press by the Doyen are without the Doyen's approval. The meeting recognized that the resolutions that were painstakingly formulated and approved after lengthy discussions contained no political significance, and any language implying such significance was removed prior to approval.</p>
<p>Letter to Council to be Delivered Next Week</p>
<p>The English Greater American Evening Post reports: It is heard from reliable sources that the Consular Body's recommendations for suppressing terror activities in the city will be temporarily delayed for delivery to the Municipal Council. Consuls to Shanghai representing various countries in attendance at yesterday's (August 2nd) meeting hold hopes that the Consular Body's reply to the appeal by the Council Chairman, Mr. Cornell, will be delivered early next week. In addition to the official resolutions, a brief statement was issued yesterday afternoon by the Danish Consul General and Doyen, Mr. Hill. Mr. Hill told reporters that he regretted that his brief remarks had been published. He had no further comment regarding yesterday's meeting, except that the Consular Body is preparing a reply that will soon be delivered to the Council. Other consuls have not made definite comments as to the likely outcome of the Consular Body meeting. One consul stated that he fully supported the suggestion by the Japanese Consul General, Mr. Miura, to strengthen the police force. Reinforcement of police strength is already underway following the Municipal Council's announcement last week that the Russian unit of the Merchant Volunteers would soon be incorporated into the police force.</p>
<p>A Debate Over Political Meaning</p>
<p>The Continental Times reports: The Shanghai Consular Body convened a meeting at 3:30 PM yesterday (August 2nd) in the Municipal Council meeting room, which lasted for two and a half hours. Resolutions were issued after the meeting. (The original text appeared in yesterday's issue of this paper.) According to the Domei News Agency, during discussion over the wording of the resolutions, a certain Consul General objected to the phrase "actual circumstances," stating that this phrase contained significant political meaning. The Japanese Consul General, Mr. Miura, retorted that the phrase undoubtedly contained political meaning, indicating that Shanghai and surrounding areas had been occupied by the Japanese and were under the jurisdiction of the Nanking government. After the remaining consuls expressed their agreement, the certain Consul General withdrew his objection.</p>
<p>Miura Proposes Strengthening Police Force</p>
<p>Mr. Miura continued by stating that the Japanese authorities are prepared to make every effort to suppress terror activities in the International Settlement. However, the draft resolutions appear to be innocuous on the surface, but in reality are not. Therefore, they should be amended. After the amendments proposed by Mr. Miura were approved and incorporated into the resolutions, Mr. Miura then suggested that the Consular Body instruct the Municipal Council to strengthen the police force and to cooperate more closely and effectively with the French Concession police, the Japanese constabulary, police stations affiliated with the Japanese Consulate, and the "Municipal Police Department." This is the first step in suppressing terror activities.</p>
<p>Austerity Measures Also Rejected</p>
<p>A certain Consul General then stated that the Municipal Council is currently seeking austerity measures, and the suggestion made by Mr. Miura to strengthen the police force is difficult to implement and is inconsistent with the austerity policies adopted by the Municipal Council. Mr. Miura retorted that the proposed strengthening of the police force is not inconsistent with the austerity policies of the Municipal Council because the intent of austerity is to save certain unnecessary expenses. Given the current situation, there is an urgent need to strengthen the police force. After the Consular Body expressed its agreement with this view, it passed Mr. Miura's suggestion.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Another Batch of Western Police Officers to Resign <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Many batches of Western police officers within the Municipal Council Police have resigned or been dismissed. It is now heard that another batch of Western police officers within the unit have filed notice of resignation, effective from December of this year or January of next year, and include Chief Inspector Lous, Inspector Squier, Assistant Inspector Gregg and Adams, Smith, Sadler, Mills, Glausley, De Ting, and seven other sergeants. Another probationary sergeant, Glerb, will resign effective next month, the 19th. Chief Inspector Lous is set to retire effective January 1st.</p>

<p>The labor dispute at the British-owned electric utility company has not been resolved. The public is greatly inconvenienced and deeply concerned about the strike. According to an interview conducted by the Pingming News Agency with the company chairman, Mr. Byland, the company submitted five back-to-work conditions to the union after Mr. Yu Qiaqing visited Mr. Cadbury to mediate. The company has yet to hear back from the union. The union considers the company's five back-to-work conditions unacceptable and has not responded. There is no news about the Municipal Council mediating the strike again.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Revised Commercial Exchange Rate to Benefit Exporters; Shanghai Importers and Exporters Can Apply; Objective is to Encourage Export of Local Products <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai market fluctuated slightly again after the Ministry of Finance announced that the commercial exchange rate quoted by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications would be revised to four and a half pence. The exchange rate decreased, gold prices increased, and prices of goods such as wheat flour and cotton yarn increased across the board. It has been learned from banking circles that in July of last year, the Ministry of Finance, because the Shanghai market's gray market exchange rate was unstable, established an application committee and, referring to the gray market exchange rate at the time, stipulated a commercial exchange rate of seven pence. It was intended to provide foreign exchange for the import of essential goods in accordance with this rate. At the same time, a list of prohibited imports was announced, with approximately 200 items, such as luxury goods like silk, broadcloth, shark fins, and bird's nests, included in the prohibition. Later, due to the complexity of the issues, such as foreign trade in the occupied areas being beyond the government's control, providing foreign exchange at seven pence would create many abuses. Therefore, the system of applying for foreign exchange for imported goods has not been implemented. The seven pence listing of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications is only for exporters to receive the exchange rate difference. Recently, the black market foreign exchange rate has shrunk to below four pence. Exporters are still settling foreign exchange at seven pence, which is causing losses. Therefore, the government lowered the Bank of China and Bank of Communications listing to increase the amount of the difference received by exporters. The goal is to encourage the export of local goods. Import trade will not be affected, and it has nothing to do with the Shanghai market in the occupied areas. The fluctuations in the Shanghai market are purely due to speculators taking the opportunity to cause trouble.</p>
<p>Applying for Foreign Exchange Requires Payment of a Balancing Fee</p>
<p>After the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications were ordered to revise the commercial exchange rate to four and a half pence, the purpose was to consider the difficulties of merchants and develop foreign trade. All exporters who settle foreign exchange can receive the difference between the legal foreign exchange rate of one shilling and two pence and the Bank of China and Bank of Communications listing of four pence and a half. Importers of goods that are not prohibited from import but are essential domestically can apply to the Foreign Exchange Review Committee for legal foreign exchange, but they must pay a balancing fee for legal foreign exchange and the Bank of China and Bank of Communications listing.</p>
<p>Importers and Exporters Can Apply</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency recently learned from the Central Bank that for Shanghai importers and exporters, such as purchasing local goods from the interior, transshipping them to Shanghai, and then loading them onto ships for export, all goods that are centrally planned and purchased by the government and require foreign exchange settlement have already been legally sold to the government in exchange for foreign exchange at the interior port when transshipped to Shanghai, and settled in accordance with this newly established commercial exchange rate. There is no need to settle foreign exchange again when transshipped to Shanghai and then exported. If local goods previously stored in Shanghai are to be exported, they can also voluntarily entrust the bank to settle foreign exchange with the government. If foreign goods purchased from overseas are not on the prohibited import list but are essential domestically, even if directly imported into the Shanghai occupied customs, they can also apply to the Foreign Exchange Review Committee for legal foreign exchange. However, it is necessary to entrust the bank to directly request from the Chongqing Foreign Exchange Review Committee. From now on, the foreign exchange on the Shanghai black market may be able to achieve long-term stability, making it impossible for speculators to practice their skills. As for the legal foreign exchange, it will always remain unchanged. The bank's listing will ultimately be one shilling and two pence and a half for British pounds and 30 yuan for US dollars. The Exchange Equalization Fund Committee's fund remains sufficient.</p>
<p>Review Procedures More Strict Than Before</p>
<p>After the promulgation of the rules for applying for foreign exchange for imported goods, the Central Bank's Foreign Exchange Review Office announced its closure. All import foreign exchange review matters are handled by the Ministry of Finance's Foreign Exchange Review Committee. However, the United Office of the Four Banks of China, Communications, China Agriculture, and Farmers has an exchange office, so the right to approve foreign exchange is now held by the Foreign Exchange Review Committee for preliminary review, and draft review opinions are transferred to the United Office of the Four Banks' Exchange Office for review. After the Exchange Office requests approval from the Board of Directors, it is transferred to the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs for military and political organs, and transferred back to the Foreign Exchange Review Committee for importers. The review mechanism is more rigorous than before.</p>

<p>The British American Evening Post reported that a large force of police was stationed in front of the American American Evening Post building at the intersection of Edward Road and Tianzhu Church Street. This morning (3rd), a small unit of regular French Annamite soldiers was also sent to guard the cement defense building opposite the newspaper office and erected new barbed wire obstacles around the defense building. In addition, three police armored vehicles and a team of Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese police are also permanently stationed there. It is believed that the newspaper office was guarded by the authorities due to the discovery of bombs and the disappearance of Russian police officer Haliar.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Summer Property Tax: Revenue Increase - Shanghai Municipal Council Publishes Statistics <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The Public Concession's summer property tax revenue for this year has increased compared to the same quarter last year, indicating excellent progress in the Concession's municipal tax revenue. The Shanghai Municipal Council's published statistics for this year's summer property tax revenue are as follows: (A) Western-style houses: Central District - 74,786 yuan, compared to 780,162 yuan in the same quarter last year; Northern District - 187,600 yuan, compared to 127,407 yuan in the same quarter last year; Eastern District - 249,149 yuan, compared to 274,125 yuan in the same quarter last year; Western District - 611,933 yuan, compared to 468,833 yuan in the same quarter last year; Area outside the Concession under the Council's road jurisdiction - 275,326 yuan, compared to 211,559 yuan in the same quarter last year; Total - 2,398,794 yuan, compared to 1,862,086 yuan in the same quarter last year.

The above figures do not include outstanding tax payments.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Mr. Chaplain Arrives at the Bureau Yesterday: Discusses Postal Inspection <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Chaplain, the Director of the Shanghai Postal Administration, went to Chongqing on official business the day before yesterday. Having completed his work, he returned to Shanghai on the Yusheng steamer the morning before yesterday. After a day of rest, he arrived at the bureau at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. He immediately summoned the Acting Director, Mr. Wang Weisheng, and inquired about the bureau's affairs since his departure. He also transferred the various tasks handled by Mr. Wang during his acting period. He began working on the same day. Mr. Chaplain also summoned Mr. Kanazashi Kin'ichiro, the Japanese Assistant Director, to discuss the matter of postal inspection at the Route Massenet Post Office for a long time. According to reliable sources, the Japanese side had contacted the Japanese Assistant Director several times regarding the postal inspection issue at the Route Massenet branch office a month ago, and a consensus had been reached in principle. The Japanese side would send postal inspectors to formally station there, but this matter required Mr. Chaplain's consent. Therefore, since Director Chaplain's return to Shanghai, the two sides have begun negotiations. It is said that as a result of the exchange of opinions, the two sides have reached a compromise on the issue of formal postal inspection in general. Because the Japanese side cited the established fact that the General Post Office had already begun postal inspection, postal inspection at the Route Massenet branch office could not be avoided. However, it is also claimed that there is still an important point, namely the attitude of the French Concession authorities. Although the French side has made verbal representations to the Japanese side on this matter, it is questionable whether it will be effective. Judging from the current situation in the French Concession, it is quite possible that the French side will agree to this move. As for the Japanese postal inspectors, they did not go to the Route Massenet Post Office all day yesterday. The main reason is said to be that the office was not yet set up.</p>
<h3 id="e87">After the Murder of the White Russian Leader: One Suspect Has Been Apprehended - This Person Had Been Loitering for Days Before the Incident - Surrounded and Arrested After a Chinese Servant's Identification <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reports that this morning (the 3rd), information was obtained regarding the assassination of Mr. Mesny, Chairman of the White Russian Emigrant Committee in this city, which occurred the morning before yesterday (the 2nd). At 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department's patrol team apprehended a Chinese suspect in front of the White Russian Emigrant Committee office near Weihaiwei Road on Muirhead Road.</p>
<p>No Way to Investigate the Development of the Case</p>
<p>It is said that the Police Department also knows of another person related to this murder case. However, the Police Department is unwilling to disclose details of how the case is developing. There is also no official news about who the arrested suspect is. It is only said that the suspect is currently being held for questioning. It was found that the suspect was captured by a Western patrol leader.</p>
<p>Loitering Chinese Man Arrested</p>
<p>Earlier, the patrol leader led officers to the White Russian Committee office to investigate. According to the committee's Chinese servant, a suspicious Chinese man had been loitering near the committee for several days before Mr. Mesny was assassinated. When the patrol leader asked and was about to leave, the Chinese servant saw a Chinese man standing across the road and immediately pointed out that the person who had been loitering for several days was that Chinese man. The patrol team then surrounded and arrested the suspect. When asked why he was loitering, the suspect remained silent.</p>
<p>Someone Witnessed Pre-Arrangements</p>
<p>He was taken to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, where he began to shout "Injustice!" The police retorted, saying that since he had not been questioned about Mr. Mesny's murder, why was he shouting injustice? It is also said that a Chinese witness reported to the Police Department today that he saw a car drive up to Mr. Mesny's residence on Nanyang Road on Tuesday morning. Five people in the car were observing the area. The witness also described the attire and appearance of the five people in the car.</p>
<p>Someone to Fill Mr. Mesny's Vacancy</p>
<p>It is said that the White Russian representatives in this city elected Mr. John Zhongjiao last night to fill Mr. Mesny's vacancy. This morning, the police inspected Mr. Mesny's body at the public mortuary on Jiaozhou Road. As for when Mrs. Mesny will come to Shanghai from Japan to handle the funeral, no telegram has yet been received. Therefore, the White Russian emigrant authorities have temporarily moved Mr. Mesny's body to the International Funeral Home to await Mrs. Mesny's instructions on how to handle the funeral arrangements.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Weisheng Answers Reporters' Questions</p>
<p>Because Japanese personnel have not been to the Route Massenet branch office for two days, the question of whether postal inspection in the French Concession has officially started on the first day seems to be a thing of the past and does not need to be repeated. However, the local newspapers in Shanghai have different records and conflicting news, which has caused much suspicion from the outside world. In order to clear up all rumors, a reporter from Dazhong News Agency specifically inquired about this matter from Mr. Wang Weisheng, the Assistant Director of the Postal Administration, yesterday morning, asking him to give a responsible answer to dispel public doubts. Mr. Wang said, "I can give a definite answer that the Route Massenet branch office has not officially started postal inspection." The reporter then asked, "Reports say that you said on the phone that you had indeed inspected and that this had happened." He replied, "Absolutely not." The reporter further asked Mr. Wang to explain under what circumstances it could be considered that postal inspection had officially started. He replied, "I believe that there must be a fixed office format and hours, complete postal inspection procedures, and the occurrence of the act of letters being detained by postal inspectors before it can be considered officially started. If it is only a matter of browsing letters, etc., it is not enough to talk about this." The reporter then asked, "After Director Chaplain returned to Shanghai, regarding the French Concession's postal inspection, did he discuss this matter with the Japanese Assistant Director, Mr. Kanazashi Kin'ichiro, and what was the result?" He replied, "They two have indeed met, but I have not participated. According to my personal opinion, since the General Post Office has been implementing postal inspection for two years, if the branch office continues to implement it, unless the French Concession authorities have other measures, Director Chaplain may not insist on opposing it and making strong representations." Finally, Mr. Wang stated, "You must pay attention that this is my personal speculation. I have been relieved of my duties as Acting Director. In the future, if there are major events, Director Chaplain must make the final decision."</p>
<h3 id="e88">Rumors About the Establishment Period of "Special Police": The Shanghai Municipal Council Has Denied It - The Shanghai Municipal Council's Reply Has Not Yet Been Sent Out - It Can Only Proceed After Bowen Returns to Shanghai <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The negotiations on the special police power over the roads built outside the boundary in western Shanghai have not been resolved regarding the detailed rules since the previous Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, reached a compromise in principle with the Japanese puppet side. Yesterday, there was a rumor that this "Special Police Bureau" was scheduled to be established on September 1st. A reporter from Pingming News Agency specifically inquired about this matter from the relevant parties of the Concession authorities and believed that this matter was not accurate. According to reliable sources, the Shanghai Municipal Council had already drafted the detailed rules for the "Special Police Bureau" in the middle of last week in order to reply to the puppet municipal government. However, it cannot be sent out temporarily. Because the detailed rules related to the police power must be reviewed by the Police Commissioner of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Bowen. Major Bowen is currently on vacation and is not in Shanghai. Therefore, it must be sent out after Mr. Bowen returns to Shanghai and reviews it. It is not yet possible to determine when it will be established. According to the English-language "North China Daily News", its Chinese-language morning newspaper on the 3rd stated that the joint police force on the roads built outside the boundary would be established on September 1st. The Shanghai Municipal Council and the puppet "municipal government" both said that this statement was "inaccurate." The news was said to have come from well-informed sources, saying that the Special Police Bureau would be formally established on September 1st, and that the Shanghai Municipal Council and the puppet municipal government had already reached a general agreement. It also stated that the Special Police Bureau would specially set up six branch offices on the roads outside the boundary in western Shanghai, in Wujiaochang, Xujiahui, Daxilu, Yuyuan Road, and two other locations. All of the above has been denied by the Shanghai Municipal Council and the puppet municipal government, and it has been pointed out that although the temporary agreement to create five branch offices has not changed, the division of the area has been revised.</p>

<p>According to the "Millard's Review", the "U.S. Trade Mission" funded by the Japanese side, with former New York City Police Commissioner General O'Ryan as its chairman, passed through Shanghai to Nanjing the day before yesterday (the 2nd). Before arriving in Shanghai, the "mission" had made extensive trips to Japan, Manchuria, and North China. The members of the mission included Dr. Hunsberger, a former member of the Yale Economics Association, Dr. Vinnard, an employee of the research department of the New York Eddie Company, and Mr. Salobawerki, a Russian-American. It is said that the main purpose of the "mission" is to promote U.S. loans to the puppet "Manchukuo." When the members of the "mission" arrived in Shanghai, they were warmly welcomed by the Japanese side, who hosted a banquet for them. The invitation cards issued by the Japanese side referred to it as the "U.S. Trade Mission" in order to make people believe that the "mission" was specially sent to China by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce or other organizations.</p>

<p>It has been found that the high tide of the Huangpu River will start today. The morning tide will be at 0:24 AM, and the predicted level is 12 feet 1 inch. The afternoon tide will be around 1:00 PM, and the predicted level is 10 feet 3.5 inches. From then on, the levels of both the morning and afternoon tides will be between 10 feet and 12 feet. It will not subside until the 10th. The water flow will be rapid during the tides, and ships should pay attention.

<p>According to people from Suzhou, the guerrillas in the area attached to Suzhou City have been unusually active recently. Since the puppet Wuxian County Magistrate Guo Huiji was assassinated, the general puppet officials have been in a state of panic. They have kept the four gates tightly closed for days and implemented special precautions. The Japanese puppet military police have been conducting large-scale searches. In order to prevent guerrillas from mixing into the city, the Nanjing-Shanghai train did not stop in Suzhou a few days ago. As a result, the transportation between Suzhou and Shanghai was once brought to a standstill. Residents in the city are in a state of fear and deeply feel uneasy.</p>

<p>In order to regulate the supply of funds from the inter-bank industry to meet the needs of industry and commerce, the Silver and Money Trades Association has been handling inter-bank withdrawals since July 1, 1939. Due to sufficient preparation, it has gained the trust of domestic and foreign bill holders. Therefore, the approved and withdrawable amounts of each firm have gradually increased. By the end of June 1940, it had set a new record since its launch. The total value of the collateral paid by each firm has exceeded 60 million yuan, and the exchange drafts are specially approved for transfer to the interior for the purchase of local goods. As for the exchange draft certificates that are prepared but not used.</p>

<p>There are dozens of servants in the Sichuan Road Christian Chinese YMCA. Their monthly salaries range from 15 to 20 yuan, and they also receive a rice subsidy of 12 yuan per person per month. However, in these days of expensive rice and high salaries, this small amount is not enough to maintain their lives. The entire body of servants of the association, together with about 100 servants of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA, jointly requested the YMCA authorities to increase their salaries by 30% the day before yesterday (the 2nd). However, they were rejected by the association. As a result, they began a labor slowdown on the same day. After three hours, the authorities of the association promised to consider it and reply tomorrow (Monday). After hearing the news, the servants all resumed work and will decide their attitude after receiving the reply.</p>
<p>Jinmen Hotel</p>
<p>More than 190 internal employees of the Jinmen Hotel at 104 Jing'an Temple Road are mostly from academic backgrounds and have been trained before being assigned to their duties. Recently, due to the high cost of living and meager treatment, they are unable to survive. At about 8:00 PM last night, a labor slowdown broke out among all employees. After the authorities discovered it, they promised to give a satisfactory reply at 4:00 PM this afternoon (the 4th). It is said that some employees have resumed work, while a few are still in contention.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Lawyer Liang Bohua Injured in Assassination Attempt Yesterday - His Friends Cheng Tiansi Died from Bullet Wounds - Thugs Broke into Room to Commit Crime Before Fleeing <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>An assassination occurred in Longjili, Lane 151, North Zhejiang Road, Public Concession, at approximately 1:30 PM yesterday. The victim was Liang Bohua, who was practicing law, and his friend Cheng Tiansi. One died and one was injured. The details of the incident are recorded below.</p>
<p>Friends Visit</p>
<p>Lawyer Liang Bohua, styled Wenzhong, is 49 years old and a native of Nanhai, Guangdong. He joined the Bar Association in September of the 15th year of the Republic of China (1926) and established his residence at No. 7, Lane 151 (i.e., Longjili), North Zhejiang Road. The house consists of two buildings and is occupied solely by him. The rooms on the first floor of the wing are used as an office. The interior is elegantly decorated, and the business is very good. He owns a car. There is a brass plate on the door with the inscription "Liang Residence, Nanhai." At approximately 1:30 PM yesterday afternoon, Cheng Tiansi, a photographer and fellow townsman, who was over 30 years old, visited his residence. Liang kept him in the living room for lunch. They were laughing and talking happily. Who knew that just as they had finished their meal and were cleaning up the leftovers, Liang got up and walked into the office in the wing. Cheng then moved to a rosewood chair against the wall. Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. A maid went to answer the door.</p>
<p>Thugs Open Fire</p>
<p>Suddenly, two uninvited guests, one wearing a black Xiangyun gauze long gown and the other wearing a Xiangyun gauze shirt and pants, entered. They asked if Lawyer Liang was at home. The maid replied that he was at home. Before the words were finished, the two thugs stepped into the living room, drew out handguns, and first fired one shot at Cheng Tiansi. The bullet hit the vital part of his chest, and he immediately fell to the ground in response. Fresh blood gurgled out, and his breath was barely audible. At this time, Bohua was in the office in the wing. Upon hearing the sound of gunfire, he was just about to come out to investigate when, to his surprise, the thugs fired several shots at him. Liang was unable to avoid them in time and was shot once in each of his left and right hands, three times in his left leg, once in his right leg, and two bullets grazed his left ear. A total of seven shots were fired.</p>
<p>One Dead, One Injured</p>
<p>Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the thugs turned around and fled, running quickly out of the alley and into a car, which sped away. According to witnesses, there were two more thugs in the car, all wearing brown clothing. However, the license plate number of the car was not easily recorded at the time. After the incident, the family reported to the Huis Division Police Station in charge. Chinese Detective Shang Wu, together with Chinese and Western detectives, rushed to intercept the thugs, but their whereabouts were unknown. They then thoroughly examined the scene of the incident in the house and took the maids to the police station to question them about what happened. They quickly summoned an ambulance to take the two injured men to the First Refugee Hospital on Xizang Road. Unfortunately, Cheng Tiansi was hit in a vital part of his body, and his injuries were too severe. He died en route before reaching the hospital.</p>
<p>Cause Under Investigation</p>
<p>After Liang arrived at the hospital, he requested to be transferred to Renji Hospital. Officer No. 228, who was escorting him, quickly sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, Cheng's body is still in the mortuary of the Refugee Hospital. According to the doctor, although Liang was shot many times, fortunately none of the shots were fatal, and his life is generally out of danger. It is understood that Liang has a wife and a son, who is about 17 or 18 years old and studying at a certain middle school. At the time of the incident yesterday, Liang was only wearing a soiled shirt, a pair of white silk pants, and a pair of shorts, as well as white socks and sneakers. However, Cheng was wearing a light blue silk shirt, white serge trousers, yellow leather shoes, and blue floral socks. When the reporter rushed to investigate, he caught sight of the blood-stained clothes and trousers stored in a lead bucket, which was heartbreaking to see. Whether this assassination is related to politics is still under investigation.</p>

<p>Ma Ziren, a 30-year-old man from Beiping, was in dire straits in his hometown in the spring of the year before last. Seeing that his wife's younger sister, Yan Jing (20 years old this year), was young and easily deceived, he had ulterior motives. He falsely told his mother-in-law that he planned to take Yan Jing south to Kunming to study, so that she could serve the country in the future, and repeatedly swore that he had no bad intentions. His mother-in-law was convinced by Ma's sweet talk and gave them 600 yuan for travel expenses before they left. Yan went south with Ma and arrived in Shanghai by boat. They opened a room at the Huizhong Hotel. That night, Yan was forcibly raped by Ma. Before a month had passed, the travel expenses they had brought had already been squandered. Ma then forced the woman to learn a life of dancing and hugging. Until the winter of the same year, she switched to the Dadong Ballroom to work as a dancer. Chen Dingming (43 years old, residing at No. 25, Lane 42, Betty Road), an employee of the Laili Foreign Company at No. 91 Beijing Road, was dancing in the pavilion when he saw that Yan's attitude was solemn and that she had no enchanting habits. So he took her in to live with him and gave her a bankbook with a deposit of 2,000 yuan. Ma also followed her to Chen's house, and all living expenses were provided by Chen. However, Ma was still not satisfied. He forcibly took away the woman's deposit. After using it up, he again devised a plan to force the woman to abscond from Shanghai, but was rejected by the woman on the spot. Ma then became angry and repeatedly used all kinds of threats against Chen and the woman. At this point, the woman realized that the past relationship could not be concealed, so she truthfully told Chen, so that he could take precautions. However, at about 8:00 PM the night before last, Ma actually broke into Chen's room with a sharp knife, intending to harm Chen. Neighbors disarmed him and reported him to the police. The police took Ma to the Special Second Court. After questioning by Judge Liao, the hearing was postponed.</p>

<p>Zhou Facai's farmhouse in Caijiazhai, Hangtou Town, Nanhui County, Pudong, was suddenly broken into by six armed bandits on the evening of July 5th. They looted 50 yuan in property and kidnapped Zhou's ten-year-old son, Fuquan. That night, they stayed overnight in Zhoupu, and the next day, they hired a car to Qichang Wharf, took a steamer to Shanghai, and hid the hostage in room 26 of the Dongchang Hotel at 398 Lane, Xiafei Road in the French Concession. At the same time, they sent a letter to Zhou's family,</p>
<p>demanding a ransom of 20,000</p>
<p>yuan. The letter also included a photo of Zhou's child to prove its authenticity. They designated a location near the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association on Avenue Edward VII in Shanghai for negotiation. The case was detected by Chief Detective Fan Defu, Detectives Qian Xianting, Jin Deshun, and Huang Hairu of the General Patrol Room. They laid in wait and arrested four bandits from Pudong: Xie, Yongsheng, Qin Guanxing, Wang Ying, and Lu Daoquan. Later, they went to the Dongchang Hotel and arrested another accomplice, Sun Ada, and rescued the hostage, Zhou Fuquan. They were all taken to the Patrol Room and sent to the First Special Court's Criminal Division for interrogation and detention. Details of the case have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide</p>
<p>held a further hearing. The Patrol Room's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, prosecuted them for robbery and kidnapping. Zhou Facai, the victim, testified that on the night of July 5th, while his family was asleep, seven bandits suddenly broke in through the back window. They were armed and menacing. They first beat his father, Alou, and then robbed 23 yuan and 80 cents in cash, as well as clothing. They also carried away his ten-year-old son, Fuquan. Before leaving, they tied up his mother and threw her into a water vat,</p>
<p>and fled with a whoop. On the 10th, they received the first letter from the gang, demanding a ransom of 20,000 yuan. On the 13th, they received the second letter, designating the negotiation to take place at the entrance of the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association between 7 and 8 a.m. on the 20th. He sent Jin Ziwen as a representative to negotiate, and he knew nothing further. Jin Ziwen testified that on the morning of July 20th, according to the letter, he went to the entrance of the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association, holding an umbrella, and negotiated with the defendants Xie and Cai. When they asked if he had brought the money, he replied that the Zhou family</p>
<p>did not have such a large sum. Xie and others said that at least 10,000 yuan was needed, so they changed the location for further talks to the intersection of Chengdu Road and Dagu Road on the 26th. At that time, he met with Xie and Cai again. He pretended to agree to 7,000 yuan and pay 5,000 yuan first, and designated the payment to be made in the afternoon. At that time, the Patrol Room detectives had learned everything, so they made the arrest when the money was being paid in the afternoon, and so on. During the questioning, Xie Yongsheng confessed that he committed the crime with the three defendants Qin, Wang, and Sun, as well as Peng Asi and Lu Aqiu, who were at large. However, the instigator was Peng Asi. Each of them was actually induced by Peng to commit this illegal act, and at that time, they were completely</p>
<p>under Peng's command. He and Sun Ada took the child away. After arriving in Shanghai, they stayed in a small inn. The ransom letter was written by Wang Ying, and so on. The other defendants also confessed. Only Lu Daoquan denied participating in the kidnapping. Finally, the hostage Zhou Fuquan pointed out the four defendants Xie, Qin, Wang, and Sun in court, but had not seen Lu Daoquan before. Lu also hired lawyer Li Wenjie for a round of arguments. The court ordered the defendants to be detained and adjourned the sentencing to seven days later. Zhou Fuquan was handed over to his father to take home.</p>

<h3 id="e104">The Voice of India <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The author of this article, Ms. Bhicoo Batlivala, is a lawyer in England who recently returned to England after lecturing on Indian issues across the United States.</p>
<p>This article is published in the July issue of Asia Magazine.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Second European War, India has felt that imperialism is about to make a comeback with a vengeance. Indian troops were transferred out of India last August without the consent of the Indian people. India was declared a belligerent without seeking its consent. The democratic gains India had made in 1937 were like fleeting clouds, and the many harsh regulations contained in the Indian Defence Act were unnecessary. According to the Act, offenders could be sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or imprisonment for more than ten years. This is a cruel and ruthless weapon against the Indian people.</p>
<p>This law was passed hastily in three days, and India could have immediately adopted a strong non-cooperation attitude to deal with it. But India did not take such action, only hoping that Britain would understand the seriousness of the issue. Not only did the Indian National Congress pass a resolution on September 18 last year to make a great representation to Britain, but also during subsequent meetings between Indian leaders and the Governor-General of India. The content of the representation was: if Britain declared its war and peace policy, and how this policy would apply to India, India would be willing to cooperate with Britain in a friendly manner. India's request is to share freedom and democracy and participate in the war as an ally, but it can no longer be a slave state.</p>
<p>Ten months since the start of the war, the British government has unhesitatingly intensified its control over India and its resources, while at the same time showing the world that this is not an interference in India's internal affairs. In order to exploit India's resources, the British government has designated the Tata Steel Factory, the largest in the Far East and owned by Indians, and the Digboi oil fields as "protected areas" under the direct jurisdiction of the British governors of the provinces. Strikes by workers in the Digboi oil fields demanding better treatment were also suppressed. The so-called "protected areas" are mostly forest areas and tea plantations, etc., which are the source of tax revenue. Even Gandhi and Nehru cannot enter these areas without the permission of the local governors.</p>
<p>The British government's favorite mantra is the so-called Hindu-Muslim problem. India has 270 million Hindus and 80 million Muslims. The British argument is that if India becomes independent, the Hindus will oppress the Muslims. The British authorities also use the fact that Muslims oppose the Indian National Congress and do not want India to break away from the British Empire and become independent as a propaganda tool. But this propaganda is a great slander to tens of millions of Muslims. Tens of thousands of Muslims have joined the National Congress, and in addition, many influential Muslim groups support the policies of the National Congress. Ninety-five percent of the Muslims in the Northwest Frontier Province support the policies of the National Congress. The chairman of the National Congress is also a Muslim.</p>
<p>The cost of living in India is constantly rising, and the already impoverished Indian farmers and workers are finding it more difficult to make a living. The Indian authorities have even mobilized troops to fire on crowds protesting the excessively high price of food. It is fortunate if the average Indian can get one meal a day. According to British medical reports, 61 percent of the Indian population is malnourished. In textile industrial areas such as Kanpur and Mumbai, there have been many riots due to rising food prices and wages not being enough to buy food.</p>
<p>Indian prices will continue to rise and, as in the last European War, pay a large amount of blood, sweat, and money again. During the last European War, the British government "drained India of blood." In this war, India again feels the heavy burden bestowed by the war. Although India's trade with the United States is in a surplus position, India's US dollar reserves are very scarce because Britain calculates India's exports to the United States in pounds sterling. India is still forced to adopt a statutory parity of one rupee equal to one shilling and six pence, and is not allowed to implement the parity of one shilling and four pence that it has requested for years.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India is under the jurisdiction of the central government of India, in other words, it is equal to being under the jurisdiction of the British government, which is equal to being under the jurisdiction of the Bank of England. Although the Reserve Bank of India has two Indian directors, they are supporters of imperialism. The bank has also been authorized by the central government of India, according to the Indian Defence Act, to manage all currencies, gold bars, securities, and foreign exchange. Therefore, Indian finance is not controlled by Indians, but by the Reserve Bank, which will result in the blood of the Indian people being drained again.</p>
<p>The Indian regular army has been mobilized and stationed in Singapore, Aden, Syria, Egypt, Palestine, and other places, and some have even gone to the Western Front in Europe to fight. When troops from Canada or Australia arrive in Europe, British ministers fly to welcome them. When Indian convoys leave their homes and travel long distances to Europe, British newspapers do not even have two lines to report. Although the British government has allowed the Indian Central Legislative Assembly not to transfer Indian troops out of India without its consent, the transfer of Indian troops this time was very secretive. In fact, India is a storehouse of British manpower and material resources, but when India asks Britain whether it will be allowed to enjoy the benefits of the war and the right to freedom and democracy, the British government promulgates the Indian Defence Act and puts thousands of Indians to death in prison as a reply.</p>
<p>The imprisonment of Narayan, who received higher education at an American university, is the most prominent example of British rule in India disregarding justice. He is imprisoned without trial, and no one knows what crime he committed. When he entered prison, he gave a long speech on India's participation in the war, saying, "A slave has no obligation to defend slavery. His only obligation is to break his shackles."</p>
<p>Gandhi also published a text on Narayan's imprisonment, saying that Narayan's arrest was very unfortunate. He is not an ordinary worker. He is an authoritative scholar of socialism. He is an excellent gentleman. He sacrificed everything for the liberation of the country. His diligence is unparalleled. His ability to endure hardship is also unmatched. I do not know what remarks made him violate the law. In the first non-cooperation movement, the government arrested the Ali brothers at all costs. Is this arrest a pre-planned plan, or is it just a mistake made by an overzealous official?</p>
<p>At present, India is not only concerned about the internal situation, but also pays attention to the development of the world situation. India is particularly concerned about the outcome of the Sino-Japanese War. Indian public opinion believes that Britain's compromise with Japan is out of sinister motives.</p>
<p>Since Nehru's visit to Chongqing last year, Sino-Indian relations have become closer. For centuries, the two countries have always been friendly to each other, and Nehru's visit has restored mutual interests. Recently, Nehru published an article saying that "no matter what the final form of future events is, China and India will have a great influence on it. Everywhere is touting a new world order and world cooperation. If China and India are not valued, there will be no stable and effective cooperation in the world." Therefore, India pays attention to China and Britain's policies in the Far East. If the British government continues to implement a policy of compromise to harm China, India will have a strong reaction. The Indian National Congress has made it clear that India has great sympathy for China. India's dispatch of a medical rescue team to China is proof of this.</p>
<p>India is now united under the leadership of powerful leaders Gandhi and Nehru. People of British India and the Indian states, regardless of class or belief, unanimously support the independence movement and are also prepared. If India has to pay a heavy price for freedom and democracy, it will not hesitate.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Britain's Air Warriors <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>British airmen are mostly young and strong warriors. They have dutifully covered the evacuation of the British and French Allied forces from Dunkirk back to their homeland and are now shouldering the heavy responsibility of defending their own territory. They fought in the skies over Dunkirk Beach, and in terms of numbers, they were indeed fighting one against five. The fighting was already very bitter. Now that German bombers are bombing the British Isles in droves, they must rise up to meet them at any time and place, and their responsibility is naturally even more arduous.</p>
<p>Britain's preparations for this war were very inadequate, but the ratio of German planes shot down by them is at least one to three. Of the countless heroes in this war, these pilots are undoubtedly the best. They must not only fly fighters but also fly bombers deep into German territory for night raids from time to time. What kind of people are these warriors?</p>
<p>The captains of each air force team are mostly neatly dressed; their hair is combed without a single strand out of place, their fingernails seem to have just been trimmed, and their uniforms are crisp and straight, not to mention. Each team has twelve planes, and each pilot has a different face, each according to his own personality. It is very difficult to generalize what kind of people they are. But whether they are regular air force or auxiliary teams, they all possess certain common characteristics.</p>
<p>They are all small in stature, especially the fighter pilots. This is simply because the seats in the Hurricane or Spitfire aircraft do not have much room to maneuver. Although they are all small, they are all strong and capable. The way they run to the airfield is like tennis players entering the competition.</p>
<p>These young people are very different from the drunken pilots in the minds of people after the last European War. They do not have many holidays, and when they do take leave, they do not stay out all night and revel. The situation of half-drunk pilots still carrying champagne into the aircraft has completely disappeared.</p>
<p>Modern aircraft not only have no place to store wine bottles, but also have complex mechanical structures. If each pilot cannot calm his nerves, he will have no hope of survival, let alone be able to kill the enemy and achieve results.</p>
<p>Today's air force tactics are also completely different from those in the last World War. The flying heroes of the last World War, such as Pikhop and Barr, were all fighting "single-handedly." Once they left the ground, they could do whatever they wanted. Today, even a fighter squadron must fight as a unit. Each pilot must be in constant contact with the captain via radio. When he has the appearance of violating the rules, the captain will immediately correct him. Each team captain is in contact with the air base and must follow the instructions of the headquarters at any time. He must report to his superiors at any time. The earphones on his ears and the microphone on his mouth are all part of each pilot's headgear, which proves that the era of individualism has fallen.</p>
<p>The impression left by these air force members is that they are all excellent young people. Under the clear blue sky in summer, some of these well-trained young people never return, which is inevitably moving. Their ages are mostly between eighteen and twenty-eight years old, with an average of only twenty-three years old. The best pilots are younger. Twenty-four years old is already considered old. Seven or eight members of the Sutherland flying boat team, the captain's age may even be less than twenty-four years old. It is such a great responsibility for such young warriors to take on the responsibility of defending the country!</p>
<p>The luckiest ones are also those who enlist as pilots. Although their military training and flight practice are short, they are very serious, and their bodies and minds have undergone rigorous testing. Once an aircraft is entrusted to them, it is their supreme honor. When they take off, all they come into contact with is a radio listening device that gives you orders, which is completely different from the situation of infantry fighting in the blood. If you are lucky, you may shoot down several enemy aircraft in a row. If you are unlucky, you will be shot down by the enemy. Each aircraft is loaded with enough gasoline for approximately two hours of flight; within two hours, if everything goes well, you must fly back to the base. Before long, you may have already departed again.</p>
<p>The speed of aircraft in modern warfare can make your nerves unable to withstand it. Unless you are usually trained to be indifferent and calm to the point where Mount Tai collapses in front of you without changing your expression, you can deal with it. British young pilots, in addition to being skilled, also possess a very strong fighting spirit. Flight skills and combat power are really mutually beneficial, which is the hope of Britain's protectors.</p>
<p>Below is a letter from a British air warrior to his mother before setting off on an expedition. The wording is tragic and does not sound like the tone of a young man in his twenties. This letter was later published in the London Times as a model for young people. The letter said, "...My mission in this war is important. Our patrols are far in the North Sea, escorting fleets and transport ships, helping to maintain trade routes, and our reports are enough to save the lives of many people... Those who serve the country should not expect rewards: if we regard the country as a place to live and thrive, we will spoil ourselves.</p>
<p>Historically, many glorious reputations, they sacrificed everything to create the British Empire. Where else is there peace, justice, freedom, and a higher civilization is evolving, which is unmatched elsewhere. What we are encountering today is the greatest organized attack on Christianity and Western civilization in history. I was born at the right time and received full training to dedicate myself to the country... I still say that this war is really a great thing; everyone has the opportunity to emulate the martyrs... The universe is vast, without the limitations of space and time. The value of a person's life depends on the degree of his sacrifice. We are born into the world to acquire inalienable personality and character. Just knowing how to eat, sleep, thrive, and reproduce, what is the difference from animals.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that evil is used by the Creator to test us. Not taking the easy way out, but only upholding the principles of morality, the Bible abounds in examples. The final test of war has arrived, and my character has been fully developed, which is a great gift..."</p>

<p>(See the Shen Bao of the Twelfth Year of Tongzhi of the Late Qing Dynasty)</p>
<p>Women are Often Jealous</p>
<p>Since Baoxi (Fu Xi) paired animal hides to establish marriage rites, with husbands and wives in proper roles, the family path was righteous. Later, in addition to wives, there were also concubines, just as the emperor had empresses and imperial concubines, the dukes had wives and secondary wives. Extending this to officials, scholars, and commoners, all had main wives and minor wives, either for selecting those skilled in serving or for hoping for abundant offspring. In ancient times, people considered several evil traits in women, including jealousy, licentiousness, talkativeness, and disobedience, all of which were grounds for the "seven grounds for divorce". The word "jealousy" might even befall men, but the female nature is cunning and possessive, and when applied to their husbands, it is doubly effective. Negligence in domestic teaching is also a result of natural disposition. When they are waiting to be married, girls are oriented towards the outside; once married, they bicker all day, treat their parents-in-law as strangers, and their nagging is constantly heard, as they monopolize their husbands' attention. In the past, Wu Huan, the Vice Minister of War during the Tang Dynasty, was granted a palace maid by imperial decree, who was exceedingly beautiful. His wife, Lady Liu, out of jealousy, burned one of the maid's heads, causing all her hair to fall out and leaving her bald. When Emperor Taizong heard of this, he granted her a golden bottle of wine, saying, "Drink it and you will die immediately; if you are not jealous, you need not drink it." Lady Liu bowed to the decree, drank it all in one gulp, but it was not poison. After she woke up, the emperor said to Wu Huan, "People are not afraid of death, and even I cannot forbid it, so what can you do?" He ordered the two women to be housed separately. Fang Xuanling's wife was extremely jealous, and the emperor ordered the empress to summon her, saying, "Would you rather live without jealousy, or die with jealousy?" She said, "I would rather die with jealousy." So he poured her a cup of wine and offered it to her; she drank it all in one gulp. The emperor said, "Even I am afraid to see this, let alone Xuanling." Both stories are similar.</p>

<h3 id="e107">We Need a New World <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Before talking about a new world, let's first take a look at the current world. What kind of world is it? I think everyone must admit that the current world is a world of suffering, with no land of joy anywhere. Some people move from place A to place B because place A is not peaceful, but who knew that the good times would not last long, and place B would be filled with the smoke of war again, making it impossible to settle down. Countries fight large-scale wars with each other, vying for cities and territories, killing and bloodshed. Individuals are also suspicious and fight each other in secret, causing many unfortunate events. Even among family members, there is irreconcilable animosity.</p>
<p>Every day when we read newspapers, in addition to war news, the news we read is: someone's gold bars were robbed, someone committed suicide by poisoning in a hotel. There are dismembered corpses on a wasteland somewhere. A female guest was strangled to death in a hotel. Someone was kidnapped or robbed somewhere. If we pay a little attention when walking on the road, we will see many disheveled, emaciated men and women lying there moaning on both sides of the road, unable to live, unable to die. The current world can be said to be full of depression, sadness, and pain everywhere. When we trace the source and explore the root, we know that the cause of this painful world is due to the inferior nature of the people of the world, to put it more clearly, it is because of the sins of the people of the world.</p>
<p>We need a new world, we don't want to be always so depressed, sad, and painful. But if we want the world to be renewed, we must first eradicate the evils in people's hearts. To eradicate the evils in people's hearts, we cannot rely on the power of politics, nor can we rely on the function of education, but on the thorough awakening of each individual. Thorough awakening alone is not enough, we must also have a painful determination to eradicate the sins in our hearts at the root. If everyone can be thoroughly awakened, have the determination to eliminate evil completely, and become a new person, the world will naturally be renewed. However, how can mankind have such an awakening, and how can they have such a determination? (To be re-published on August 8)</p>

<p>— Tang Da</p>
<p>During the war, President Lincoln often visited hospitals everywhere, and the soldiers were very excited to see his kind face and encouraging words.</p>
<p>In bed number twenty-six in a certain hospital lay a sixteen-year-old boy, severely wounded and seemingly unable to survive. President Lincoln stood by the bed, and as he held the boy's pale hand, he began to ask in a soft, motherly voice, "Poor boy, is there anything I can do for you?"</p>
<p>The boy fixed his eyes on Lincoln's face and asked, "Would you be willing to write a letter to my mother?"</p>
<p>Lincoln replied, "Of course I would." He then took a pen and ink and wrote a long letter. He then said to the boy, "I will drop it off at the post office later. Is there anything else I can help you with?"</p>
<p>The boy replied, "Would you be willing to sit by my bed until my last breath? I feel like I'm about to die."</p>
<p>These words touched the President's heart, and tears welled up in his eyes. The boy didn't move or say anything. The President sat there from four o'clock until seven o'clock, when he indeed took his last breath. He stroked the boy's hand continuously, like a mother, and when the boy's face showed the signs of death, he threw himself on the boy's face, closed the boy's eyes, and gazed painfully at the boy's peaceful face.</p>
<p>Everyone in the hospital had tears in their eyes.</p>

<p>But do you know how I treated him? In the film, I actually grabbed mud and threw it on his beautiful white suit that he wore while strolling on the Shanghai beach. Oh! How I hated doing that! Imagine, how could I bear to cruelly throw mud on someone I liked? Especially when he was wearing a snow-white suit and a snow-white wig! Oh, I really couldn't do it. Even though I grabbed a handful of mud in my hand and raised my arm, I just couldn't throw it. Director Mr. Butler shouted loudly, "Shirley, throw it! Throw it! What are you waiting for?" I was shy and didn't dare to say that I loved Mr. Barrymore and didn't want to throw mud. But do you know what Mr. Barrymore did? He immediately shouted to me, "Shirley, throw it quickly! Throw that big handful of mud as much as possible – throw it hard, cover my white suit!"</p>
<p>Oh, how could I refuse? I had to steel myself and throw the handful of mud. Immediately, the black mud covered his white suit, even getting on his white hair. As soon as this scene was filmed, I immediately ran up to him and said, "Oh, Mr. Barrymore, I'm so sorry, I had to throw that mud on you!" He just smiled, bowed deeply, kissed my hand, and then said, "In this country, there must be ten million people who would be willing to have the mud you throw from your hand on their best Sunday clothes. Little girl, I am one of those ten million people! Oh, don't you think this story is very lovely?"</p>
<p>I also fell in love with Gary Cooper, but his body was too long and didn't match me well, so I left him.</p>
<p>Besides, the ones I loved were Joel McCrea and Curly Top Hannaford. I was wondering which one I should marry. I met them both while starring in "The Little Colonel." Oh, Hannaford wasn't really a curly-haired dog; that was his nickname. He was actually a clown in a circus, an English clown. He could do all kinds of tricks on horseback that would make your stomach hurt from laughing. He was even more interesting than an elephant eating peanuts. He knew a lot of clowns, and if I married him, I could always play in the circus.</p>
<p>As for Joel McCrea, he was also fun. He had the best shoulders in Hollywood to ride on. One day, while filming a picnic scene in "The Little Colonel" on Lake Hughes near Greenridge, he let me ride on his back for a while. I rode steadily, covering his head with the lace of my short skirt, looking like he was wearing a grandmother's bonnet. At that time, my mother, the director, and the cameraman all laughed and shouted, "Look at Old Lady McCrea! Shirley is riding on Old Lady McCrea's back!" Then Joel and I laughed together.</p>

<p>Composition: The Person I Admire Most</p>
<p>Calligraphy: I am a Chinese Child</p>
<p>Advanced</p>
<p>Composition: A Poor Person's Summer Life</p>
<p>Calligraphy: I Have Two Treasures: Hands and Brain</p>
<p>Composition Topic Guidance</p>
<p>The Person I Admire Most: The person you admire most should be limited to one person; otherwise, the word "most" becomes meaningless. The person can be from any time, ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign. The reason for admiration is the most important point of the entire essay and must be explained in detail. As for the structure of the essay, it can generally be divided into several types: start by presenting the person you admire most, and then explain the reasons for admiration one by one; this is the first method. Start by stating the criteria for admiration, then name the person and contrast his/her deeds with the criteria; this is the second method. Start by mentioning several people you admire, then move on to the person you admire most, explaining the reasons one by one; this is the third method. There are many methods; the above three are just examples!</p>
<p>A Poor Person's Summer Life: For this topic, you must first clearly understand the subject. At the very least, you need to conduct on-site investigations into the actual lives of poor people, obtain several key points, and describe these key points in detail so that every sentence is well-founded. Generally speaking, you should focus on clothing, food, and housing. From these three points, show the suffering of poor people's summer lives. If you have any feelings, feel free to express them. It is best to have concrete solutions; empty words of emotion are not very meaningful. The so-called concrete solutions can be divided into what local authorities should do, what people in society should do, and what children should do. If you can write an essay according to my method, it will definitely be wonderful.</p>
<h3 id="e111">To the Children Regarding the Summer Homework Competition <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The summer homework competition questions have been published in four installments. Each time, there is an article guiding the writing of the composition topics. I believe the children will be very happy to do their summer homework and make great progress in their studies. I now have a suggestion: I hope you will carefully look over the compositions, calligraphy, and drawings you have done. If you are not satisfied, you may redo them until they are perfect. Fortunately, there is still more than a month before the deadline for submission, so there will definitely be no problem with time. If you haven't finished all the topics, I hope you will quickly schedule your homework time and complete them in order. Don't be careless anymore, because cramming at the last minute will not yield excellent results. Children, you are competing with all the children in Shanghai (children from other places can also join) to see who does the best work and who is the most capable. Isn't this the most meaningful thing? It has never happened before, this first large-scale homework competition. No one wants to give up this opportunity, and everyone wants to put in their best effort. I dare to say with twenty-four points of enthusiasm that I hope you will make a special effort!</p>

<p>The meaning of the stamp below is worth explaining to all the children:</p>
<p>The design in the center, "申," is the ancient form of the character "申," and the bell shape is a wooden clapper.</p>
<p>The Shen Bao newspaper bears the important responsibility of promoting education and disseminating culture. Therefore, it adopts the meaning of the saying "Heaven will use the teacher as a wooden clapper," using the wooden clapper to symbolize the important mission that the Shen Bao newspaper bears!</p>
<p>This time, it is used as the essay seal flower. All the children's test papers should be cut and pasted with one seal in accordance with the regulations. Otherwise, no matter how good the content of the manuscript is, the test paper will be invalid. Pay close attention!</p>

<h3 id="e115">Hollywood Chinese Actress Anna May Wong's Journey into Film <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Li Dun</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>In her early years in Hollywood, Anna May Wong often played roles in anti-China films without realizing it. The earlier "The Thief of Bagdad" is a good example of this. Therefore, the Chinese people did not have a good impression of her. Since returning to China for observation, she has had a very good impression of her motherland and decided to change her style. Since the outbreak of the war, people from all countries have unanimously and enthusiastically supported China's resistance and reconstruction for victory. Therefore, this Ms. Wong felt even more deeply the errors of her past thoughts and actions, realizing that her motherland was ultimately lovable.</p>
<p>Therefore, her thinking has completely changed. From now on, she will take the path of "winning glory for her motherland."</p>
<p>Anna May Wong has been involved in film for a long time. Few people have mentioned her journey. I will give a brief account:</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>In her childhood, she was also a complete movie fan, often skipping school to watch five-minute movies. At home, she would use her bed as a stage, act as an actress herself, and perform various poses that she found interesting in the movies for her parents. One evening, while she was taking a walk, a person in charge of a film company looking for Chinese actors suddenly came up to her and said, "God! If you bless her, I hope you will make this beautiful big-eyed girl quickly agree to be a Chinese actor." At the time, she was overwhelmed with surprise and quickly agreed to this person in charge. Although she spent a lot of effort persuading her parents and shed a lot of tears, in the end, she finally obtained a sense of comfort in fulfilling her wish.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Her debut was under the direction of Marshall Neilan, playing the main role of a Chinese wife. Later, she played a supporting role in a color film (Norma Talmadge), but she won great praise from many directors. Originally, in this film, she had to cry, and she really cried non-stop, causing the audience to wet their handkerchiefs. At the time, a director said, "Give her a lifeboat, and she will drown in her own river of tears." It can be seen the extent of her expression at that time. After that, she played a supporting role in the anti-China film "The Thief of Bagdad" directed by Douglas Fairbanks.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>Soon, she was invited by film companies from various countries such as Britain, France, and Germany to make films, so she left Hollywood for a trip to Europe. Her fame also came at this time. A few years later, she returned to Hollywood again. Recently, she said in a statement, "Year after year, the Chinese Soul has grown in me. Now I am completely Chinese." How sincere and admirable these words are.</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>The German Embassy in China recently shipped a propaganda film "Baptism of Fire" from Berlin. It was screened at the German School in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 19th at 9:00 PM to entertain expatriates and Chinese and foreign journalists.</p>
<p>"Baptism of Fire" is a propaganda film depicting the activities of the German Air Force during the Polish campaign, produced by German photographer Bertrem and 20 others.</p>
<p>During the Polish campaign, the German army conducted a blitzkrieg, which ended in 18 days, which made the filming difficult. At that time, in addition to the 27 staff members who participated in the filming, three aircraft were used, one Heinkel aircraft for shooting battle scenes, one Junkers aircraft for transporting equipment, and one slow-flying Stork aircraft for taking aerial views of the dead after the air battle, such as Warsaw, which was destroyed by the war, and the highway that was heavily bombed.</p>
<p>Several scenes of German Air Force bombing in the film are shocking. On the same evening, newsreels of the "Norwegian Campaign" were also screened. The "blitzkrieg" adopted by the official propaganda department included several shots of capturing enemy soldiers near Oslo, further emphasizing the ferocity of the German war in Norway.</p>

<p>The China Drama Society's "Emperor Gaozu of Han" has been widely publicized. At one point, due to the playwright Fei Tai's illness, there was talk of using "Fragrant Concubine" as the debut performance. However, it has now been decided to perform "Emperor Gaozu of Han," and rehearsals are scheduled to begin next week. The director is Fei Mu, the director of "Confucius." As for the date of the premiere, it cannot be determined because there is no suitable theater. However, it is said that the New Art Drama Society's "Sea Hero" is in contact with a certain theater. If it succeeds, "China"'s "Emperor Gaozu of Han" can also be staged in succession.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Student Cartoon Society <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Tong Ming</p>
<p>After Walt Disney's Snow White was released, cartoons swept the entire world. Even China, which has been called backward, has been affected by its fluctuations and is budding. Recently, a student cartoon society has appeared. The society is entirely composed of students who have considerable training in cartoons. Under the efforts of Yu Daxun and Wang Jun, the first cartoon short film is about to be completed. The protagonist is a stupid and gluttonous dog whose stealing food causes all kinds of jokes, which is quite meaningful.</p>

<p>— De Wang</p>
<p>Also, remember a bizarre and humorous story in a certain film: A car was speeding on the highway, and suddenly a beggar jumped out from the side of the road, recklessly disregarding what was in front and behind, crossing the road, and as a result, he was run over by the car and killed, his flesh and blood blurred, and his torso and limbs scattered on the ground. The car that caused the accident ran away. Gradually, a strange person came from afar. He walked up to the beggar's corpse, smeared some ointment on the remaining limbs, and put them together with the torso. After breathing on it, the poor beggar was resurrected. The method of filming this kind of person being run over by a car is very simple. The actor first lies on the ground. When the car approaches him, the camera stops filming. The director replaces the actor with a specially made wooden figure whose limbs can be separated, and lies it on the ground and lets the car run over it. Then, some blood-like liquid is applied to the wooden figure, making it look very lifelike, enough to fool the audience's eyes! There are countless such deceptive spectacles, and the author is not willing to write more.</p>
<p>(6) Color Movies: When movies were first invented, there were only black and white colors, which of course could not satisfy people enough. Therefore, scientists continued to study hard, trying to improve the monotonous black and white films into pleasing color films. They initially wanted to apply colors to the film, but as a result, this kind of colored film, because it could not be very precise, was not lifelike enough. Later, after further research, they came up with the principle of using the three-color printing plate, and invented natural color color films. The manufacturing principle and method are roughly as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e122">The Destination of the Dance Queen <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Several Guesses</p>
<p>Hawthorn nodded and walked towards the elevator. I followed him, continuing to ask questions.</p>
<p>"Is Ni Jinshou still looking for this person surnamed Yu?"</p>
<p>"No, since this person surnamed Yu has temporarily disappeared, he naturally has no way to start. He called the headquarters and notified me that he wanted to talk to me first, and then think about how to proceed."</p>
<p>"Then, why did I just seem to hear him say he was going to the Yangtze Hotel?"</p>
<p>"That's because he went according to my words, to investigate Lu Jiansheng's whereabouts last night." At this time, we were already standing in front of the elevator. The elevator came down. After the steel door was opened, a large group of people poured out, including many enchanting women. We entered the elevator and stopped talking to each other. The elevator went up floor by floor. When it reached the seventh floor, we walked out. This hotel is one of the most expensive hotels in Shanghai. The people who come and go here all seem to be wealthy members of the bourgeoisie on the outside, but I believe that if you peel off their masks, there are many "miserable" people inside, and the things they do are also mostly "unspeakable." We turned a few corners in the long carpeted corridor before finding room 774. On the small glass plaque in front of the room, the words "Jin Jun" were indeed written. Hawthorn stood in front of the closed door for a while, but did not immediately knock. He looked to the left and right, and a waiter wearing a white uniform was walking from the east end. Hawthorn waved his hand into his pocket, immediately pulled it out again, and walked towards the waiter. I saw him make a very quick movement, as if he had stuffed something into the waiter's hand.</p>
<p>He opened his mouth and said, "Number 71, I want to ask you a question." (65)</p>
