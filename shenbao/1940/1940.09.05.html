<h3>越督向華保證　不許日軍假道犯滇　港傳日軍準備明日在越南登陸　越南與中政府已商定應付辦法</h3>
<p>香港　據廣州灣華人方面消息、日本艦隊刻游弋於越南海外、封銷東北全部海岸、海防刻成活動中心點、法籍與土著軍隊皆被微發防守沿海各要點、法當局準備將法人婦孺撒出沿海城鎭之外、法當局對於拍發電報已予以嚴厲檢查、又據華方消息、越南當局已與重慶政府議定越南被侵犯時應採之計畫、聞越督德古已向重慶保證、無論如何不許日方武裝軍隊假道犯滇、亦不許日方在越南設立根據地、（四日路透社電）</p>
<p>香港　據此間消息靈通人十所接之情報、日本所提出要求允許軍隊假道越南之最後通牒、現已撤回、聞法當局與日視察團之討論、今日已在河內賡續舉行、惟越南自法方拒絕日本要求後所引起之緊張、仍然尖銳、昨晚西貢無綫電消息已宣布定期鐵路交通暫時停頓、據昨日由越南飛抵香港之某可恃觀察家語人、日方前曾通知越南富局、日軍將於九月六日星期五在該處登陸、日本駐越南視察團領袖西原曾通知越南政府、謂自維希方面對日本要求作不圓滿之答復後、日本對於軍隊登陸、必須採取主動地位、此項行動將等於侵犯、據廣州灣華方消息、越南總督德古、對於萬一此種侵犯實現時、中法當局所將採取之手段、巳與中國政府商妥辦法、（四日路透社電）</p>
<p>仰光　越南法當局與日代表今日復在河內繼續談前判、聞日本委員團主席西原將軍、未堅主越南接受日本最後通牒之條件、按西貢昨日發表公報稱、日本已於星期日提出最後通牒、要求准許日軍假道越南、越南法當局已予拒絕、此後據香港來電稱、日軍刻正準備於九月六日在越南登陸（四日路透電）</p>
<p>香港　聞日方現準備九月六日派兵在越南登陸、據今日抵此旅客所得消息、派往越南之日方使節團首腦西原將軍、已通知越南政府、謂日本接獲維希方面對日方要求之不滿意答覆後、定九月六日採取初步行動、派軍登陸云、按西貢昨公佈官報、披露日本於本月一日提出最後通牒、要求准許日軍經過越南、此牒已經越南法當局予以拒絕、（四日路透社電）</p>
<p>重慶　今晨各報均以顯著地位、登載官方宜布日本已向越南提出最後通牒、要求軍隊假道之消息、所有華人均殷切期待繼續發展之消息、回憶外長王寵惠曾於八月廿八日發表宣言、聲明日軍如在越南登陸、中國當局決心採取自衛手段、並派兵開入越南、當時因尙無非常發展之報吿、此項宜言頗引起驚異、但爲闡明中國對於萬一日軍侵犯越南之態度起見、中國乃決定發表此項宣言、華方唯一關於日本越南談判之消息、謂越南當局允以米煤橡皮及其他原料供給日本、但要求以恢復法國鐵路交通及日本將不在越南採取任何軍事手段爲交換條件、聞日方在同意恢復鐵路商業貨運之前、會提出若干條件、目下正在討論中云、自日本提出最後通牒之消息證實後、越南局勢、已完全改觀、此間人士皆以日本如侵犯越南、戰事恐將迅卽蔓延至南海方面爲懼、中國當局雖願望此項最後通牒之結果、不致引起日本與越南間之戰事、但均以爲和平解決頗少希望、因現時此項問題已超過越南當局按制之外也、此間相信、倘使越南允日軍通過、華軍卽將開入越境以保衛湞邊、但在另一方面、如越南拒絕日本之要求、日軍將於九月六日派軍登陸、是時越南富局不論採取何項決定、越南境內之戰事、皆恐難倖免、中國應付局勢計劃之詳情、雖尙未宣布、惟聞最高統率部早已完成準備、軍政部長何應欽最近曾飛往滇省、與該省主席龍雲會商日本萬一侵犯越南時所將採取之軍事手　、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>法日談判未　臻決裂地步</p>
<p>西貢　越南法當局拒絕日軍假道越南之要求後、越南全部局勢頓見緊張、因檢査綦嚴、故未能確如目前之情勢、或最近，將來將有何事變、惟今似尙未臻決裂之地步、因日本之要求雖經公然拒絕、而雙方談判仍在表面友好合理之狀態中進行、西原現仍留越境、（四日路透社電）</p>
<p>維希　法國半官方面引述某負貴文吿云、法日政府關於雙方在遠東利益之談判、已繼續有時、並未間斷、（四日路透社電）</p>
<p>維希　此間負責方面頃證寶、法日兩國政府正就雙方在遠東所保有之利益、賡續進行談判、外國方面所傳談判中斷之說、並非眞相（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>日否認對越　提最後通牒</p>
<p>東京　日外務陸軍海軍三省頃稱、關於西貢所傳日本曾致最後通牒、要求假道越南入滇之訊、此間並無所聞、外務省稱、河內日代表團與法當局之談判、仍在進行、並有若干進步、然尙未達到完成、又此間法國人士稱、就彼等所知、局勢米曾變化、（四日合衆社電）</p>
<p>東京　陸軍部今日吾認外傳日本已向越南提出最後通牒、要求日本軍隊通過越南之消息、陸軍部發言人稱、日本目前正與維希之貝當政府進行關於越南各種問題之談判、此項日本提出最後通牒消息之發自倫敦、足見英國對於目前法日談判結果之關注、外傳消息復謂越南之法國當局已拒絕日本之要求云、（四日合衆社電）</p>
<p>東京　外務省發言人須磨今日接見新聞訪員時聲稱、吾人希望法屬越南一切安靖而善加治理、外間與此相反之種種謠言、實不足信、吾人希望在數日之內能將各事商妥、渠未接有越南叛變消息、有問及日本與貝當政府進行之談判者、發言人答稱談判刻正在進行中、但尙未臻最後階段耳、（四日路透社電）</p>
<p>西貢　法屬越南叛變之說、毫無根據（九月四日路透社電）</p>
<h3>周恩來對記者談　全國在領袖領導下　國結益趨堅強　北方戰事開展近半月　目的在牽掣日軍兵力</h3>
<p>重慶　大本營政治部副主任周恩來、本日邀請華籍記者多人、舉行茶會、並發表談話稱、全國在領袖之領導下、抗戰意志愈趨堅强、而團結亦日趨鞏固、外傳日軍將展開秋季攻勢、據渠觀察、日軍將主力置於四川正面一層、頗有可能、但自宜昌至重慶、與曩日自蕪湖至漢口不同、必須有極大兵力、在大江南北迂迥包抄、始克有濟、若華軍各綫均取一致攻勢、牽掣日軍、則其企圖必遭粉碎、現北方戰事、展開巳近半月、津浦平漢平綏正太同蒲五條鐵路及十一條公路之交通、已經割斷、允以正太路爲最、此種行動、將爲長期的有計劃的、其目的卽爲牽掣日軍兵力、使其無力作渡河之準備、更無力抽兵南下云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>理想與犧牲</h3>
<p>今夏英法對德作戰的敗衂，在耳熟能詳的許多原因之外，有一點必須指出的，就是雙方精神方面形態的不同；凡彼此外交運用的異趣，兵力動員的懸殊，分析起來，都該從精神方面，去求確切的解釋。二十五年來，德國全國唯一的理想就是如何擺脫凡爾賽的枷鎖，收回已失的故土，並實現日耳曼民族的統一。唯其如此，所以德國人民甘受納粹嚴厲統制而不辭；而納粹當局，爲了發抒其抱負和理想，也不惜用盡一切手段以求貫澈，這種情形適與英法方面的支絀動搖，舉棋不定，形成明顯的對照。尤以近十餘年來，英法的對外政策，幾乎根本缺乏統一一貫的步驟和立塲；其應付德義，時而縱容、時而制裁，於建立和平陣綫旣乏堅決信心，對大戰前途復無充實準備。其人民更席戰勝餘威，習於享樂與安逸，此種情形以法國爲尤甚，因此在大戰中亦以法國失敗爲最慘。這些現實主義精神的極弊，正是使英法前此慘遭敗衂的主要原因。</p>
<p>自法國投降，英方陷於孤軍苦戰以來，美國痛感刺激，其軍備建築亦遂以空前規模和速度從事推動，並除却物質建設而外，在精神力面亦復加以相當的警策。本月二日羅斯福總統在大烟山公園開慕演說當中，曾特別針對着上述弱點大聲疾呼，指出專事譏笑理想蔑視犧牲而僅以滿足當前生活爲已足者，無異是藏於國內的敵人。羅氏這一表示，一方面固屬有懲於英法敗績之失，他一方面，也正由於在美國本身也具有同樣弱點存在。在美國所謂孤立主義者實即現實主義的另一形態，羅斯福總統所指斥的譏笑理想與蔑視犧牲者流，無疑也適以孤立派爲主要對象。此輩在國際間，雖尙不似綏靖政策所造罪惡的影明昭著，但也同屬正義與安全的重大敵人。</p>
<p>進步是人類生存的重要因素，理想正是領導人類進步的明燈，而理想的絕滅必然會造成社會的停滯以至退化。但在促進理想實現過程中，也必不免要付出相當的代價。在封建時代與宗敎生活當中，理想曾受過無上的椎崇，而犧牲則爲可貴的美德。自產業革命以來，個人主義隨着資本主義經濟一齊發展，舊時代的社會機構崩潰了，世人的意識形態也遭受了變革，於是金錢放逐了理想信條，享受代替了赴義精神，躭於理想和正義的人往往成爲被嗤笑的對象。這樣個人的幸福固然比較前時代增加到倍蓰，而整個人羣的利益則無形受到蝕損，產業革命本來代表着人類社曾經濟的進步，但只有上述一點却是可詛咒的一面。馴至此種現象更反映到政治領域，形成現實主義與綏靖政策，一切都僅止着眼於當前的利害，不問原則上的是非，追求着片刻的苟安，不管未來的利害。十年以來，整個世界之弄到兵連禍結，把前此業已奠定的安全基礎都消失殆盡，個中因果，固已昭昭在人耳目；但在事實上，則尙未受到最後的淸算。故在今日，爲了追求最高理想不惜一切犧牲的殉道精神，實有特予强調的必要。</p>
<p>理想之時常遭受非難與蔑棄者，據說無非以其空疏無當實際；其實，如果是那樣，就只能算是幻想而非理想。所謂理想者，必須具有合理性與實踐性，絕不是單憑思考幻成的空中樓閣。但另一方面，一切理想，又必然是對於現實的修下以至改革，因此也必然遭遇阻力，而犧牲乃成為必要。世人之譏笑理想，一句話說穿，只是為了對犧牲的畏憚。實際上，舉凡人世一切動靜，無不需要付出相當代價，所望愈奢，代價愈大，正不僅追求崇高的準則爲然。如果好逸畏難，只想不勞而獲，其唯一前途必然是悲慘失敗或沒落。個人如此，國家亦何莫不然。德法的興替已提供了一個非常明顯的例證，在美總統嚴重警吿之餘，不僅美國人，全世界的人民和政治家於此均當知所借鑑。而在爲自由獨立而奮鬥着的中國，如果也有貪圖苟安畏忌犧牲而鄙棄遠大理想之輩，亦望其能瞿然驚醒。</p>
<h3>劃時代遠大行動　美英訂海軍協定　以驅逐艦換租英屬地　增可强防務不威脅他國</h3>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統、以咨文送交國會、宣布和借西半球英領土內海空根據地、以超過艦齡之美驅逐艦五十艘爲交換物事聲稱、此事與美國不明聞戰爭之地位毫無妨碍、更非對任何國之威脅、此爲嚴重危機當前時、美洲防務準備中之一種劃時代的遠大行爲、防務之準備乃主權國莫不放棄之特權、今在目前環境中所使此種持權、乃維持吾人安全所必要者、美國自魯西亞那收買（指美國前向拿破崙收買密西西譬河以西法國領土事而言）以來、卽採行國防計畫、當時亦猶今日、以美國安全防外來攻擊之考慮為基點、今日此舉乃計畫之最重要行為、美洲海岸安全前哨綫、對於西半球之價值、實屬莫可計算、凡負規　與組織美國海、陸防務之責者、久已認識此種前哨綫之需要、蓋欲保護馬拿馬運河、中美與南美北部及安提和　　·加拿大·墨西哥灣海岸、非此不可、其與西半球防務重要之關係、固甚　明也、因此理由、余乃乘目前機會而取得之云、</p>
<h3>美英協定卽可實施　無需經美國會通過</h3>
<p>總統於其咨又中、宣布司法部長傑克遜對於總統職權實行此項協定之意見、據此間傳說、此項協定卽可實施、無需經國會立法通過、羅斯福總統在乘車赴華盛頓之途中聲稱、此海察根據地之主要價値、爲美國可屛敵於門外云、總統對於將來或將採行更遠大步驟、續取遠方根據地、以保護西半球之意見擱置不談、新聞記者詢以目前美·英協定將否爲美國在格林蘭設立根據地之先聲、總統答稱、渠以爲、新聞記者不宜發表其他事件、將肇端於此之言論云、總統父稱、美驅逐艦將於適合情理之短時期中交與英國、新聞記者問若干驅逐艦是吾已在赴英途中、總統答稱、渠不欲言之、渠不知各艦刻在何處、美國不能將各艦送交英國云、總統最後一語、殆作驅逐艦須由英國或加拿大艦員開往英國之解、英相邱吉爾囑其駐美大使宣布、英國決不放棄或鑿沉英艦隊一事、已引起新聞記者對於美國現所得根據地他日可否爲英艦所用之推測、羅斯福總統不願討論之、惟謂渠僅以爲英艦隊將赴防務所需要之處云、（四日路透電）</p>

<p>夫婦悲劇的原因和補救</p>
<p>一夫一妻文明社會中最好的家庭制度。一對夫妻，男強女健，各個盡其功能，在農村社會中男耕女織，在都市社會中男子出外經營商業或工業，女子在家裏料理家務，夫婦愛情體貼而溫存，生育子女活潑而仱俐，這當然是一個和樂而健全的家庭。這種健全的家庭，不特他們夫妻兩個享受着快樂和幸福，也是社會的良好而安定的基礎，關係於民族國家，非常重大。我們在生理心理上的研究，一對男女，各因其生理需要而結為夫婦，應該宜爾家室，愛情濃厚，樂勝于飛，何為而要在家庭裏發生着悲劇呢？</p>
<p>家庭悲劇的原因，雖有多端，但除了男子過於貪心，討了一個老婆之外、還要來一個妾或是另行金屋藏嬌、則所謂「若要家不和，討個小老婆」。多了女人，雞犬不寗之外、其最多的就是男子性能的衰弱。我們在女子心理上的研究。她除非不嫁他，如果一嫁了他，那就將整個的身心都交給了他。只要他能予以充分的快樂和安慰，那她就感覺着終其生只有一個他可以了解她，所以說痴心女子負心郎，女子大都是痴情的。可是子若於早年犯有自瀆遺精，或婚後的荒淫縱慾，致精枯血竭，在性機能方面發生病態，在腦，脊髓，神經方面，更時覺頭脹腦痛，健忘失眠，耳鳴眼花，心神不寗，腰痠背痛，肢體疲憊等症。此種男子在夫婦生活上，將如何能領受妻子之熱情？熱情而被欺騙，這是如何痛心疾首的事！若長此犧牲，能不使她惱羞成怒！演出家庭間種種的悲劇！在今日社會上妻子與人發生關係，或明目張胆與夫法庭相見振振有詞訴請離婚者，實時有所聞，此種丈夫遭此悲慘，他內心上的痛苦，試易地思之，能不淚下？同時因身體過弱，何能受此嚴重刺激，若再憂傷過度，更有形成未老先衰，或竟早年殤亡之慘！</p>
<p>不過，聰明的男子，我們知道上述病症並不是不治之症，如能對症治療，必可恢復健康，據世界名醫及余多年經驗，均公認服雄壯動物生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，最為對症而特效。因此劑於服後一日夜間卽能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，若能繼續服用，必可將上述病症完全治愈。惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」以固精關，制止遺洩，測收效尤速。</p>
<h3>遺精為最傷身的疾病</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>因為精液是我們生命的源泉，所以遺精是最足以傷身害命的疾病。現在我們分析言之，有下列數點：我們一個人體內的精液，係攝取食物中最貴重的養料，經過生理上種種物理化學的奧妙作用，才由睪丸製成而流注於精襄。如果流注過多了。果然也要呈過腃狀態中之溢精，大約未婚而成年的健壯男子每月也有一二次。這是生理的不能算為病態。可是由溢精而致犯手淫，或由手淫或其他的意淫招致了病態遺精，也是很多。不可不慎重預防。總之，精液在體內除非交之外，（但亦不可荒淫，荒淫後也有種種弊害。）精液後富地保留在體內，對於身體實有莫大的裨益。因為它功能調整新陳代謝作用，助長發育機能，滋養各部神經，以及健腦補腎增強精力等種種用處。如果青年而一有遺精，或由遺精惡化成滑精漏精，則體內精液卽無法貯蓄，必至精枯血竭，是以新陳代謝作用減退，在身體之各組織，只有老細胞死去而甚少新細胞產生，遂呈面黃肌瘦，生命之活力減少，若長此下去，可以未老而先衰，發育機能受阻，致身材低矮，性器短小，如童稚，此外在腦脊髓，性三大神經方面，亦陷於衰弱症象，常有腦力不濟，健忘失眠，耳鳴眼花，腰痠背痛，肢體疲憊。賢虧無能，絕遺力渙散等症，並且精液之不絕遺洩，生理上不及產生，致精液中常缺乏精蟲，或竟至全無，就造成不育症。…凡此種種，我們可以知道，遺精不特傷身，並能絕嗣，其危險為何似！至如性能衰弱，在夫妻生活上無法圓滿，更將造成人生莫大的悲劇！此症之唯一治法，據世界名醫及余經騐，均以為服「希米脫氏固精片」，最為特效。服後卽能聓固精關，鎮靜神經，戒除邪念，遺精無不可以立卽斷根。但如因遺精已引起上術症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，調整新陳代謝作用，促進發育機能，若繼續服用，必能早日完全恢復健康。</p>
<h3>妳瞧！乳峯多麼重要</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>竟然操縱着女性一生命運</p>
<p>「牡丹雖好，全仗綠業扶持」，一個無論怎樣漂亮的女子，假如沒有一對高聳的乳峯和豐腴的臂部，把曲線美以分顯露，那麼卽使你衣錦綉之袍（旗袍），戴珍貴之飾，革覆絲襪，點唇畫眉，終覺得美中不足，正似牡丹少了綠葉，不但在交際場中，不能左顧右盼，表示自己的健美，而為人竊笑，卽於夫婦之間的私生活上，試問一塊半坦無垠的怪模樣，一觸入你丈夫的眼廉，這時你心中的感想如何？你丈夫的感想如何？我知道你的丈夫卽使當面不說，然而他對你的愛情，使會漸漸的冷淡下來，或竟至在外恒歌酣舞，徵妓宿娼，你雖然老大的不開心，但是一想到自身的種種缺陷，就衹好苦在心頭，抑鬱寡歡，不但此也，因乳峯萎癟的結果，關係女性整個健康的卵巢機能必然失健，新陳代謝力亦失交替作用，於是月經不調，白帶黏漣，宮冷不娠，性感淡薄等症，勢必相繼踵至，遂致生育艱難，終其生而不獲一孕，雖有百萬家產，亦衹好拱手讓人，一念及此，乳峯對於女性的幸福，關係實在大了。</p>
<p>然則此種缺陷，難道竟無法彌補嗎？據世界著名生理學　家兼美容專家康德林與婦科名醫湯潑生等一致主張，如女子患有乳房萎癟，臂部瘦小，月經不調，帶多不娠，性感淡薄等症，可服奧國期丹那博士發明的卵巢製劑女用「生殖素」，最為對症而特效，蓋比劑係動物的卵巢精質，經過科學煉製，試想：以壯健動物的卵巢精質，補入卵巢機能失健的女性，無怪服後一昔夜間，卽能發揮偉大的藥力，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月經，暖宮止帶，如繼續服用，能使萎癟的乳峯，漸漸高聳，瘦削的臂部，變得豐腴，且能增旺血液，使面色肌膚，從滋潤而白晳的皮肉裏透出鮮紅的光彩。</p>

<p>我們在社會上應付任何一件事情，當有經過手之前，或者認為這件事非常棘手，有些不好應付，但結果是很順利的解決了。亦有在未經手以前，覺得這種事一目瞭然，可以嗟叱立辦，可是結果不但不能助記詞期藏事，甚而至於連一些頭緒也沒有。所以我認為天下凡百事情，決沒絕對的容易，也沒有絕對的困難。道不惟說對社會任何事情如此，就是我們治療白濁毛病也何獨不然。譬如性白濁人多認為易治的，然而患慢性白濁的人還是這麼多，難道他們都沒有經過急性期嗎？至於說慢性白濁難治，然而就余一人以言，十餘人中，治愈何慮六千人，均經衛生證明無毒，而且從未復發。總而言之，統而言之，無論急性慢性，如果醫家有豐富的經騐，精婦的手術，敏銳的脹光，超特的設備，不大言欺人，忠誠服務，精確診斷，對症發藥，症勢縱兇惡萬分，亦能十拿十穩。担保快則兩星期，慢則五星期就能全部解決，且絕對可不虞再發。要是醫家手段拙劣，設備不全，而且未能忠誠服務，那便是初現症象的新白濁，哼；恐怕也休想及期而愈。</p>

<h3>少年希特勒的潦倒</h3>
<p>他在母新安葬之後，帶了一些餘下來的錢。重返維也納。在幾個月之中，這個不願意順從父命做政府官吏的青年，日趨下流，直到經濟和社會的最下層。從他二十歲起到二十三歲的三年中，青年的希特勒度着流浪生活。寄居在維也納的一家小客棧，每天向教堂裏弄一碗免費的湯裏腹。冬天替人家掃搜尋雪。他的仇人後來索性大加渲染，說他在這潦倒時期中如何狠狽。有些人却聽說他做過裱書匠，油漆匠，更有人說他生理方面有些缺憾形同白痴，提防他隨時有發癲的可能。其實這些無非是些編造出來的笑話而已，總之，他這時候十二分的不得志，做一件失敗一件，而且常常諉過於人，對於這個世界愈弄愈不滿意，却是實情。</p>
<p>在他開始流浪生活之前幾個月中，他曾担任維也納一家建築公司磚瓦搬運夫。他當時以自尊的態度，對自己和對願意聽他說話者道，他願意好好的做這工作，一路昇遷上去到建築師為止。他一打扮得像學生一樣，頗有「鶴立雞羣」的姿態。同伴叫他加入工會，被他拒絕。吃飯時候，他獨自一個子吃點牛乳麵包乳酪之類，並不礨飲啤酒。其餘工人對他都覺得很奇怪，便用許多話來色引他的真相。他們說明各人對國事外交的政治思想。從工人的立場來說，他們都是些認識不甚清楚的社會主義思想者。他們攻擊資本家和官僚：他們又討論宗教及道德　各種問題。</p>
<p>希特勒對於他們一番議論，所具的見解頗屬含混，這也難怪，因為他究竟還是個青年小夥子，見識不廣。他反對中流社會，反對平民的獨裁制，或工人政府，但不知道自己所信仰的是些什麼。他夢想着大德意志聯邦高強偉大使他不愧為這一國的國民。中飯時候，他往往會蹲在建築台架上，默不做聲的聽工人們紛紛議論。突然間，他以響仇心理所激起的姿態，和神經質的情緒，對工人們大聲演講。他雖竭力要把他深而強的情緒傳達出來，但是總歸詞不達意。只因為他年衹二十歲，讀書不多，旣沒有中心思想，又不會鼓簧弄舌，結果一些也引不起人家的視聽。不久，工人們不但取笑他，並且對他表示討厭。一天，他正在滔滔不絕的演講，中途給同伴們打斷，叫他立刻離職，不計回來，否則他們要把他打下台架，他被這班初次聽講者所拒絕，只得離職他去了。</p>
<p>他流浪生活從此開始。然而希特殊勒一生中勤讀的時期，也在這時候開始了。他因為在建築台架上，受着工人們辱侮，其讀書自有他獨特的見解：一則他要恢復自尊，要把事實和合理的原則，來支持他的情感；再則他要實現當在腦中的大德意志觀念，不願以流浪者或者普通工人終其身。他主張以讀書致用為目標。這年輕的亞多爾夫天天埋頭苦讀，把同住在小客棧裏的同伴，作為辯論的對家雀兒。他個人對於世界的觀念，漸漸的由此型成，他並以此為一已自尊的救星。他一貧如洗，餓寒交迫。自修工作，一經開始後，他最初讀馬克斯的作品，斷定工會的幕後為共產黨，他對於工會是深惡痛絕的。其後又讀關於猶太人的書；他以為共產黨的幕後就是猶太人。他所痛恨的中流社會，具有官僚習氣，在他們所定的教育制度下，使他不能成為建築師的，也無非是這些猶太人在那裏作崇。他所讀和所思者，類多如此。</p>
<p>希特勒住在小客棧中，靠零星畫點名信片，由一個朋友替他在馬路上叫賣度日。有時繪了一張大幅水彩畫，放在公共寧中的火爐旁烘，不但顏料容易乾，而且使畫面蒙上一層黃色，看上去好像是遠年古畫，　　捒了個幾十年並不　出名的畫家姓名，簽在那幀畫的角落上，他的朋友再把它拿到啤酒館中，高價售給外來的旅客。</p>
<p>小客種中的住客總是高談闊論的人，世界任何國家，任何地方都是如此。這裏面的「寓公」，誰都是吃不飽，穿不暖的；晚上睡在硬棚棚的鐵絲墊子上，身上衹蓋着一條薄薄的毯子，把白天穿的衣裳脫下來，捲了一捲，塞在頭下作為枕頭。要是叫這班人大家不講話，不是就要悶死了麼？青年希特勒在他們中間是個最稱健談的人。他並不單講政治，他談話資料花樣頂多。許多朋友也都愛聽他的妙論。因為無論如何總比餓了肚子，一籌莫展的蜷縮在屋角裏好；而且也可　比　　圈慎惱。希特勒對他們說，應如何由他　指導，互相合作。他替他們安排，某人應該學習繪畫，某人應該設計廣告，某人應該專繪照牌，其餘人應出去兜售這些東西。這樣大家就能伸梢了。</p>
<p>他思想　敏，念頭很多。據他的同伴某君敘述希特勒趣事如下：一天，希特勒有見報上登出售生髪水的廣告，上面畫着一個長髪委地的女人，那文字的開頭說，「我，安娜，克苯茜拉……從前是個禿頂，如何用了這生髪而長出了一頭青絲，所以竭力把這種可靠的東西介紹給大衆。希特勒的朋友們，就以此為討論的中心，要研究究竟有沒有這個叫做安娜，克茜拉的女人，而且她的頭髪究竟是不是用了這種生髪水而重新出來的，希特勒心想這明明是個騙局，他的朋友們却有些疑信參半，以為製造生發水的廠家如果沒有把握，怎好弄出一個安娜，克茜拉來，連說這生發水有效呢？</p>
<p>希特勒究竟聰敏。他毫無疑義的說這廣告是個騙局。他說，要是朋友們　　　　的話，他也會弄這樣一　把戲，為他們去賺幾個錢來。他們一聽此話，不覺眉飛色舞，忙要請教如何做法，希特勒說，也罷了你們且去　弄些舊馬　口鐵罐頭來，把膠水裝在裏面，賣給店家，叫他們把膠水塗在大玻璃窗上，冷天玻璃就不會裂碎了。他的朋友聽了之後，不覺取笑他。他們說，那裏來的膠水呢？雖道膠水不要錢麼？希特勒說，不要忙，你們儘可把任何東西業充做膠水——灶間裏的湯汁，或者更簡便些，至磚瓦場中弄點石灰來，攬和在清水之中，也就得了。他的朋友駁他道，那未這也不成其為膠水了，怎樣到冬天會使玻璃不燥裂呢？希特勒說：我們可以在夏天出售。並且對店家說，冬天用的東西在夏大買，價錢要便宜多哩。</p>
<p>希特勒一個念頭來了，一個念頭又起，他說，鈔票應該做得小些，把它入在明角的盒子裏，那末就能輕用而不易破粹了。他的朋友說，這節實是「匪夷所思」。像這樣的大家七勿搭八講了一大套，便預備入睡。先把襯衫襪子脫下來洗，以備明晨乾了好穿。其中有些人每晚都洗衣，有些却偶爾一洗。希特勒就是偶爾洗洗的人。那時候有個來自薩克森鄉下農人子的同伴，常常開玩笑的說：一希特勒在洗襯衫了，明天一定放晴的了。（未完）</p>

<h3>法租界嚴重戒備　係維護境內治安　與公共租界採同一步聚　傳將繼續施行至九一八</h3>
<p>本市英法兩租界警務當局、於前晚十二時、決定聯合採取特別戒備後、當即漏夜進行各項戒備之佈置、迄晨始告完竣、至昨日兩租界各重要馬路口、均已擱置鐵絲網障碍、其缺品處均加派探捕駐守、對行人車輛、予嚴密檢查、同時兩租界巡邏隊及鐵甲車、亦相繼出動、在界內各馬路逡巡不輟、使宵小無法活動、一切措置與各重要紀念日相同、而法租界方面這戒備　其嚴密尚尤過之、公共租界方面、則較為綏和、據消息靈通方面暗示、此項戒備、將繼續至數星期這久、蓋因「九一八」紀念卽將屆鹽也、茲將詳情分誌如次、</p>
<p>法警務處申述意義</p>
<p>據法租界警務處發言人昨日對記者稱、此次法租界在重要路口架設鐵絲網之措施、並無特殊之意義在內、本埠一般人對於法租界重復架設鐵絲網障碍物一事、聚訟紛紜、莫衷一是、但該發言人鄭重聲稱、目下次在淞滬抗戰第三週紀念前後之特別戒備時期、成績甚為良好、故此次再度仿行之、該發言人末稱、法租界當局對於重採此項措施、並無特殊之目的</p>
<p>其作用僅在便利警務人員之搜查工作而已、</p>
<p>西報所載戒備原因</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、法租界與公共租界警務當局、於午夜起以至今日（四日）、在界內各處採取戒備、整日不懈、本市可靠人士相信、警務當局所以取此戒備者、因恐劉吶鷗被殺後、某方團體今日擬施報復暴行故也、午夜甫過、兩租界許多通衢中、橫架鐵絲網、巡捕搜查隊亦大增、在夜間從事嚴格搜查、至今晨仍賡續進行其職務、查劉吶鷗係昨日（三日）午後二時十五分、在福州路京華酒家被殺、聞警方現扣禁目擊此槍殺案之嫌疑犯二人、</p>
<p>獲得情報臨時決定</p>
<p>某方團體擬施報復暴行之說、今晨由工部局警務處某要員之言、加以證實、緣該員稱、警務當局係接情報而取戒備者也、又法租界警務處某員先謂所取戒備、「僅係例行任務」、然旋卽承認昨日深夜與公共租界警方合作、而取此舉、記者又請工部局副警務長施茂如說明戒備原因、施氏承認警務處乃獲情報而有此舉、惟所獲情報甚含誌如次、不復發他言、</p>

<p>沿愛多亞路法租界之各馬路、均已佈置鐵絲網障礙物、僅外灘·天主堂街·大世界·馬霍路·聖母院路·亞爾培路等數處、留有隙口、以維交通、河南路及東新橋街等處從不封鎖者、昨亦阻斷、此外法租界中區各非要道馬路、均已添置更多鐵絲網障礙、以備隨時應用、進行搜查、昨日呂班路康悌路亦攔成缺口、該處一帶、空氣仍極緊張、公共租界方面、則僅愛多亞路·外灘·江西路·福建路·大世界等處攔有缺口、其餘各處情形、並無變動、</p>

<h3>金市為謠諑所左右　大漲小回動盪不定</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤猛升後、重告降落、以消息混亂、交易熟烈、乍上乍落、多不勝舉、晨初以人心續昂、開盤卽猛跳六十元、為六千三百五十元、未幾外匯奇縮、激起盛大買風、尤以銀號多頭加碼、猛抬至六四百四十元、惟為證劵幫及散戶高價獲利了結所影響、及其時利空流言忽盛、賣方較多、價遂抑低至六千三百十元、收盤卒為六千三百三十元、較上日軋好四十元、午後週三無市、聯場外初疲後挺、乃傳日軍海防登陸之說、價在六千三百七八十元光景、半日成交頗旺、約三千兩、銀樓飾金終則掛高十元、海關等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤高漲四十元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以匯市報緊、人心仍堅、且各幫均先叫買、於是開盤卽跳六十元、首由金號進錢兌業三十兩、為六千三百五十元、嗣因買氣仍盛、再漲二十元、銀號進證劵幫二十兩、為六千三百七十元、旋金號銀號幫吐出、同時銀一亦有拋出、一度曾告下挫、錢況兼出金號三十兩、遜為六千三百三十五元、此後因匯市緊度加厲、某銀號多頭加碼、另一銀號亦辦進千餘兩、不久於買風下竟哄起一百〇五元、銀號進銀樓素等五十兩、創為六千四百四十元新近最高峯、後散多見高了結、未幾某證劵幫巨額多頭亦忽來出範、而金號幫之多頭公司亦有吐出、故市勢頓告下轉、退至六千四百元內、時再加市上復傳國內某種利空消息、因之實賣風漸大、初時狂吸之某銀號亦來復吐、迨午收前竟現六千三百十元當日低價、惟收盤稍轉、結果告六千三百三十元收市、比上日尚漲四十元、收後場外平疲、六千三百十元曾有成交、然午後場外復挻、因傳日軍海防登陸之說、做高至六千三百七八十元、全天一百三十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十數元、收進減低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>首飾金軋高十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍應六百四十元、迨九時半即高十元、十時二十分再大十元、十一時半回小十元、結果軋大十元、計大同行改懸六百五十元、新同行與上價相同、收進減低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣漲多跌少</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市況、烚赤大漲小回、終仍見漲、英美金鎛卒漲一元、英金票交易漸減、市價站平、美金票一度高至十九元三角六分、嗣忽傳宋氏有蔣出任財長之職、近午退為十九元一角、午後忽又有日軍在海防登陸之謠、故又高至十九元二角、比上日終漲二角八分、香港票隨港滬匯兌續漲、新加坡票稍有需要、市價略漲、日金票又趨低落、晚市退為一元六角、比上日又降六分半、朝鮮票亦供過於求、晚市退為一元一角七分、</p>
<h3>分幣劵是真貨偽　發行銀行應有表示</h3>
<p>市上發現五分偽幣、自本報首先揭載、一般商店、多已注意、今日報載、平明社記者並將真偽五分劵不同各點、予以祥細說明、此在收授分幣劵者、於辯別真偽時、更感便利、惟該社所舉第一點：「真劵反面未端所具之英文為（UNION　PUBLISHERS&amp;PRINTERS，FED．INC．U．S．A．）而偽劵則為（UNIONPRINTING　CO．U．S．A）、記者頃以一分輔幣劵對比、則一分劵反面末端所具之英文、上述二種英文俱有、前者紙張光滑、後者紙張比較稍形粗糙、色澤前者深而有光、後者淡而無神、號碼前者左右兩端俱有英文字母、後者則僅左面有一英文字、惟版本俱極清細、精晰、大小亦相同、殊無從辨別其為真為偽、意者一分幣劵當不至作偽、倘係分批印刷之故　、（茲將二種分幣劵附上請編者審閱之）</p>
<p>此次分幣劵發現偽劵、已引起社會多方注意、究意是真是偽、負責發行之銀行當局、似不應充耳不聞、默不作聲、平明社所舉各點、雖可辨別真偽、但以上述一分劵而論、似仍不無可疑、深望銀行方面有正確之表示、俾知適從也、（君美）</p>

<h3>糧食　洋米趙評價而飛騰　奸商心猶未壓…洋米雖到雖煞漲風　新來陸續登場…販運乃僅仗脚踏車</h3>
<p>洋米昨市較堅、開市卽見本銷活動、繼之內地鄉荘客戶跟蹤逐鹿、一雯那間、各價已齊評價、至此市面、旣無伸縮餘地、一般多頭心交易、猶謀大舉舉吸收、又施欲擒故縱之技、先抑後進、以淆聞聽、於是形勢愈覺紊亂、傳說收盤行情、表面雖仍嚴守限綫、僅有近元上落、而暗中已陽逢陰違、以貨品而論、則已暗砌一二元不等、且傳一號西貢火絞等已在場外有六十三四元之新暗盤、蓋早晨開市後多方借越南謠言以鼓動市面、貨主更扳俏不肯輕脫、且有汕頭內地各幫之心思交易、市面已呈逢勃氣象、衹因限盤照舊且將小絞降五角、故市上正式交易衹有以次代高而已、卽原包英華司因限價七十元、市上衹有六十五元正式成交、然場外黑市則傳有七十二三元做開三四百噸、現洋米明暗晚易亦有一萬三四千包、大部份為囤戶收進云、</p>
<p>於此米商大事操縱聲中、無如洋米仍有大掛到滬、華綸洋行大浦輪、由西貢直接運來洋米二萬五千元九百八十二包、昨晨抵埠、停靠浦東鴻興碼頭起卸、（祖）</p>
<p>粳糯國米昨到一千餘包、際此混亂局面、無論明暗市交易、傅聞亦皆激盪異常、貨主居奇扳俏、作客盲然搜進、售價因之猛漲一二元不等、原包貨大都已穿出七十元大關焉、計開常幫普通白粳七十四元、鮮特清粳竟達七十六元、無錫清粳七十三四元、常州蘇崑粳七十二三元、次至七十元左右、青角薄稻七十二元、南港原包早稻七十一元半、斛見六十八元、至於糯米金溧特元開六十八、九元丹貨六十六七元、香港貨與國糯相仿云、</p>
<p>新粳除周浦貨續至三十五次上市、不過多從脚踏車運來、所以為數有限、衹八担、品質較周浦新粳為佳、適值他貨奔騰、區區竟不敷分配、價開六十八元、周浦新粳去路亦暢、開六十七八元、計升一二元之巨、太倉新羊尖到貨雖屬蟬聯、然以內地交通不便、亦惟脚踏車堪運至數微而銷暢、轉瞬卽專馨、計十二担、開六十四元耳、</p>
<h3>粉市續緊　福新阜豐均供半數</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日現紛市況、續見緊和、內阜豐廠減半供給後、福新廠亦繼之減少供給、廠盤雖未更動、回籠貨已售十五元二角之價、同時三鑫廠對於現紛亦限制供應、雖衹十四元五角、但已乏貨呆購、故十月份鳳凰牌囤戶收買頗殷、價由十五元二角升至二角八分、成交五六千包、洋紛及內地堅擯未開、</p>

<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉、市況頗呈活躍之狀、現貨市況亦殊見熱鬧、同時又因華爾街股票價格之良好、故棉市甚為堅定、結果收盤價格較之上日漲七八磅音、印度棉市昨日先因一部份空頭抵補而　漲、續後各方盛傳英政府在印訂購麻袋五千　八百三十一萬　七千只、盛沙作防空之用、因之棉市飛騰、結果連同預測、較之昨日漲十四羅比之巨、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來殊見熱鬧、奈因市上存底不豐、故各方素價頗高、同業間意有不願出樣者、蓋因各方深悉訂購外棉及運輸之不易、按照此種情況、棉價將日漲一日矣、</p>

<h3>嚴禁槍宴</h3>
<p>江南鄉闈後，搶宴之風，由來已久，推原其故，皆民間向於科塲時派當差役，除供應外，所有舖墊器具，應由各應差者收回，然役吏跟丁，往往乘間攫取，故不得不多派夥計在旁伺候，一俟宴畢，卽行收取各件，此時人多手雜，胥吏等仍不免乘勢搶攫，於是乎有搶宴之名。當其初未嘗不懼官之查究，迨托詞越搶越發，由是沿訛襲謬，迄今則宴畢猶未起身，而七手八脚張牙舞爪者，已環立四圍，伺間下手，坐者甫經站立，而桌上已有手指伸下亂抓以去，於是羹湯翻汚，碗盞鏗鏘，曾不轉瞬間，而滿案中空無一物，各官尙站定未去也。殊不知鹿鳴宴乃朝廷禮賢之意，典至鉅禮至隆，故前月三十日設宴，沈制軍深惡此積習，先期出示嚴禁，謂如有仍蹈故轍，不遵示論如前搶宴者，卽照軍法從事；且改在貢院內設宴，飭令上江兩縣把守門頭，一切閒人，槪不准入。故是日孝廉赴宴者共有八人，一切儀文皆從容中節，不似歷科之草率了事也。</p>

<h3>活不下去</h3>
<p>— 萬家春</p>
<p>我因爲生活相當忙迫，便無緣優閒的散步。可是我每天晨出晚歸，以及因職務關係，常在街上大跑特跑（寫得正確些應該是走）。雖然兩脚辛苦，我却把牠當做散步，於是脚步也輕鬆起來了。</p>
<p>我原是把一切的走路當做散步的。我走着走着，却接連看見了六個附蓆子捲着的死屍，這使我散步的興趣，打了一個大折扣。可是我並不减少正視現實的勇氣：在我脚邊繼續溜過的，却是一個中年婦人。她坐在地上，手裏抱着一個孩子，身旁又躺着一個，嘴裏嚷着：「媽媽：我要吃大餅！」那女人只呆望着她自己在水門汀上寫的「活不下去」四個粉筆字哭泣。</p>
<p>這樣忽忙的散步，已經走到了白克路的盡頭。許多野孩子以及路人昂起了頭向一個三層樓的窗口望着，我也佇足而觀；却見窗口邊站着一個外國人，他撮起二個手指向馬路扔出黃金色的角子（這大概是喂「吃角子老虎」的角子），孩子們便爭着搶，搶得起勁，他更扔得起勁。看見汽車駛過，他更大批的扔出來。我看這屋子是外國兵的什麽俱樂部的屋子，才知道外國人在喝酒跳舞作樂之外，現在要拿中國窮苦小孩子的生命來尋開心了！</p>
<p>走到熱鬧的馬路上，常常可以碰到散發藥品」廣吿的人。任何人走過他們身邊，傳單便從他們的手指縫裏遞過來，霍霍作響，非常動聽。萬一貪小便宜，想拿一張廣吿紙回去作煤爐生火之用，接受過來，那末就請你買一包藥品。當此時也，他們包圍着你，不得不買。買來的藥品，却比藥房裏的貴。這些霍霍之聲，居然也解決了一小部份人的生活。</p>
<p>日落西山，正要回家，「散步」散到貴州路，頭頸上忽地圍過來一條粉嫩的玉手，還有鶯聲瀝瀝的伴奏：「化三角洋鈿去坐一會兒白相相！」化三臺錢到什麽地方去「坐」她還沒有說明，可是我是打定主竟不去的。於是說：我晚飯也沒有吃，還是等一會去坐吧！」「不，不，等會兒你不會來的。」可是我輕輕的乘其不備，一溜烟跑進一家商店裏去了。……和老板談了一會，天忽然下雨了。街上的「野鷄」都變成了落湯鷄。我想起剛才的事，問老板：「她們很多拉不到客吧？」老板答：「不！她們每天總拉到一二個。」又問「每個客人只化二三毫錢吧！」答：「哼！起碼七八塊錢，說不定袋裏有錢便「亨白冷」「道去。」「唔！」－可是被出賣皮肉的她們又得到一些什麽呢，這些可憐蟲！</p>
<p>人物</p>
<h3>師母</h3>
<p>— 裴苓</p>
<p>我們弄裏有一所小學校，這學校裏的校長早死了，如今就由師母繼續下去。</p>
<p>這位師，據我們的房東太太說，是「沒有知識」的。這話作何解，恐怕連她自己也講不明白。但在事實上，她的四個兒子，都在那小學校裏畢業的，而最小的一個毛毛，現在也讀三年級了，算起來都受過師母的「敎化之功」的，所謂「沒有和識」者，大概是指沒有財產罷了。</p>
<p>她的確是沒有什麽財產的，卽使她有一所小學校，那也不過是一所弄堂小學。天井做操塲，亭子間當敎務處，房子小，却拚命的招攬生意：以致六個學生合一張桌子。新近又在竈問裏增設了幼稚園，於是「麻雀雖小」倒也「心臟俱全」。論起來，當然是師母功推第一說。</p>
<p>因爲我們這裏有十幾個孩子在她那裏讀，成　她的一個「大主顧」，所以在暑假裏，她便常常來玩，湊滿了人數，便在房東家裏雀戰起來。八圈完了，師母將牌一推：「這樣吧。徐師母你贏十八千，算毛丰的學費好了！」</p>
<p>「好的，好的。」徐師母也樂得少一筆開支。</p>
<p>麻雀完了，便又閒談起來，師母又問：</p>
<p>「昨天夜筒開什麽？」</p>
<p>「漢雲；」王師母正在因爲忘記了打而悔恨。</p>
<p>「哎呀；眞的漢雲麽？我前天夜裏夢見一匹牛，我又是屬牛的，怎麽不打漢雲呢？」師母想起了前夜的夢。她想想，如果打着的話，就可以辦一個什麽獎學金了！」</p>
<p>當我放下筆時師母又在那裏叫了：</p>
<p>「王師母，來四圈好　？」</p>
<p>註「漢雲」是花會三十六門</p>
<p>中之一據說是「牛精」</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第六章　危險的經歷</p>
<p>霍桑繼續說：「我將汽車加增些速率，追到和前一輛車十碼光景的距離，便照着前面的速率，遠遠地跟着。那汽車經過貴州路，西藏路，又向西進行，一直到徐滙路，一路上並不停頓。在徐滙路將近終點，忽而突然掉頭過來。這時我幸虧眼快，忙向支路上轉灣，避過他的視綫。你們猜一猜，他把車子向東回駛，到什麼地方停頓？」</p>
<p>我答道：「可是仍回到亞東旅館嗎？」</p>
<p>霍桑忽向我瞅了一眼，點點頭。「對，包朗，你的推理力的確不錯。他仍舊住在亞東裏啊。」</p>
<p>「那末，你已知道了他的房間號數嗎？」</p>
<p>霍桑忽皺着眉峯，微微發出一聲嘆息。「沒有，這就是，我所說的失敗點了。因爲他的汽車在亞東的西面的側門口停住，就下車走進亞東裏去。我當然也跟下來。那時我已經過一度臨時的化裝，外衣也丟在車廂裏。當他走進西部的電梯間時，我本來也趕得着進去。可是我因着過分謹愼，怕被他瞧破眞相，不敢跟他同乘那一次電梯。我沒有辦法，祗得在電話間門前等着。等到電梯回下來時，我急忙進去問那司機，那司機對於先前一次的客人雖的略有些印象，但不很淸楚。他說那僩有鬚的人，似乎在五樓下梯的。我相信這個人眞住在五樓，至少總也在亞東裏。所以我打算回來跟金壽兄商量一下，再去査問他實在的號數。」</p>
<p>倪金壽作懷疑聲道：「他不會從一面電梯上去，又從另一面電梯下去，用蛇脫壳的方法賣掉你嗎？」</p>
<p>霍桑搖搖頭道：「一不會，我在汽車中追隨他時，非常小心，絕不曾引起他的疑心；就說他瞧見了我，要賣掉我，在汽車兜圈子的時候，儘可找別的機會。爲什麽重新回到亞東裏去？你總知道罪犯們常遵守着一句格言：「犯罪塲所是個最好的隱避所。』他一定以爲這個地點很安全呢。」</p>
<p>「你相信他冉不會搬走嗎？」</p>
<p>「不會，他旣相信我已中槍又不知道我曾追隨他，况且我退出旅館時，那輛八〇八四四汽車也開走了。我料想他一時也許還不會離間旅館。」（九七）</p>
<p>隨筆</p>
<h3>變了</h3>
<p>— 楓子</p>
<p>朋友，我現在可以稱你爲朋友了，因爲你說得不錯，我們的確都「變了」。雖然只有短短的三年，但是我已深深地體騐到了生活的滋味。在這個大都市的鎔爐中，我看到罪惡的種子在每個黑暗的角落裏繁榮着，我聽到被壓迫的人們在低氣壓的下面呻吟着，同時，正在我逐漸地看透這個美麗的都市底層的時候，我又看到了侵略者使人觸目驚心的烽火。這連珠般的槍砲聲啊！彷彿至今還在我的耳畔邊盪漾着。朋友，假使到了這個時候，我不再「變」！我還能算是一個「中國的靑年」嗎？</p>
<p>過去好比一個可怕的夢魔，我毫無留戀地把它摔棄了。現在，我不能再沈默地忍耐下去：這鐵和血混合而成的現實，已經教會了一個應該怎樣反抗。朋友，我的「轉變」決不是一個奇蹟，正如你的「轉變」一樣。</p>
<p>「變」，這可祝福的「變」呵！它不但已把我們二個懦弱的靑年「變」成了這樣的强硬，它不但已把別的許多靑年們「變」成了國家的前鋒和社會的棟樑，而且從後還要使更多的人們來總「變」一下。是的，在這個大時代中，我們應該山一個寄生蟲「變」成一只猛虎，應該有一件廢物「變成」一塊巨石，朋友，就是我們的國家也正在漸漸地由衰弱「變」成堅强呢！那麽，讓我們來作一個「變」的先驅者吧！</p>
<p>人生</p>
<h3>生命的消磨</h3>
<p>— 周戊</p>
<p>抽空去拜訪一個已就業的老同學，問起他在空暇時做些什麽消遣。他搖搖頭，聳聳肩，說：「就這未過了！坐坐，睡睡，高興時出去玩玩。」</p>
<p>我當時一下子說不出話來，我眞爲這樣一個靑年可惜。而最可惜者是在這代時，有着無數的靑年和這位朋友一樣地消磨着寳貴的時光，這眞眞是生命的消磨！</p>
<p>有很多的靑年在跑進社會工作後，就把他們職務上的工作看做是分內應爲之事，而把空暇的時間就白白地消磨着，混過去；在他們則以爲這是工作後應有這樣的「休息」。他們或許都緬想着要有一個偉大的未來，希望着前途有遠大的發展，但他們的行動却與他們的願望背道而馳。</p>
<p>在就業以後，對職務上的事當然要分外努力，盡自己最大的力量去做，但祇是這樣，充其量不過是一個幹練勤勉的辦事員而已。假使要指望發展，指望昇遷，則應當利用辦公時間以外的空暇時光，來改進自己，充實自己。工作後適度的休息是應有的，但對其餘的時光應好好地利用來達到心中的願望。空下來就「坐坐」，睡睡」，「玩玩」，這還不是將寳貴的生命在逐日消磨？</p>
<p>我記得有道樣一句雋語：「我們時常詛咒着人生的短促，但我們的行動却是像生命是永無止境的一般！」</p>
<p>而大概道般在消磨生命的靑年各有其「鴻鵠之志」，但心想東而却走向西，我深深希望他們能醒覺，別再作生命的消磨者。</p>

<h3>東京舞孃改業裁縫</h3>
<p>— 華志</p>
<p>東京的娛樂事業，自經「中日戰爭」以來，原已很不景氣。最近「反娛樂運動」變本加厲，一切娛樂事業如電影，賽馬，打彈子，乃至閱讀電影色情畫報，都在限制之列，而各跳舞廳，且有於十月一日起，一律關門之試。一般跳舞從業員，頓時感到失業的恐慌。</p>
<p>査東京的跳舞廳，年來幾經淘汰，碩果僅存的，只有「帝都」「京橋」「福羅利達」「聯合」「泉橋」「日米」「廣和」「銀座」等八家，擁有舞孃三百六十名，樂師一〇九人，其景况本來不佳，不過聊以糊口而己。她們中很有企圖效法前輩的姊妹們，到中國來別謀出路，不過想到較佳的位置，已經被人捷足先登，都遲遲其行了。</p>
<p>但據銀座舞塲某大班談稱，東京舞孃的前途，並不十分悲觀，其中有一部份未雨綢繆，已經學得了縫衣的技術，此後卽將改業裁縫；另一部份則擬在酒排間充當招待，以資熟手。至於一輩失業的樂師們，因爲此後爵士音樂亦將嚴厲禁止，倒不容易找尋相當的出路呢。</p>
<h3>吳素秋又到滬獻藝</h3>
<p>— 梅花館主</p>
<p>吳素秋一行，受更新舞台之聘，已於昨日午前乘盛京輪抵滬。索秋此來，所帶配角，共二十餘人，茲將各員簡史，臚述於下：</p>
<p>遲世恭　生角，爲老伶工遲子俊之長孫，富連成科社「世」字班卒業，才質俱佳，年齒尙穉，愚去秋赴平時，曾數觀其劇，許爲可造之村，惟雨時適在嗆後，底氣未足，致發音尙未能盡如人意。春初接平友哈殺黃君函吿，謂世恭自入春以來，嗓音已逐漸開展，高寬低三音俱備，四郞探母空城計捉放曹珠簾寨武家坡諸劇次第上演後，觀衆均一致贊許，報上亦多獎譽之文，哈君爲談劇能手，所言自屬可信也。</p>
<p>傳德威　爲中國戲曲學校第一期畢業生，習武生，功力極深，戲又廣博，扮相身上，俱極邊式。出校後，歷在各院搭班，幫吳素秋之日期爲最多，愚曾觀其「長板坡」「惡虎村」二劇，長靠短打，俱滿人意，才具與楊盛春堪　伯仲云。</p>
<p>李德彬　小生，亦戲校畢業生，文戲固佳，武功尤有根底，如「探莊」「鎭　州」「雅觀樓」「臨江會」諸劇，演來尤多精彩，上次偕新艶秋南來，觀衆一致推重，謂後起小生隊中，文武兼擅者，惟德彬一人，此言確非溢譽。吾友兪振飛君，亦謂德彬之武小生劇，在現時梨園行中，足當首屆一指之譽。</p>
<p>關德咸　亦戲校第一期畢業生，習鬚生，戲路最寬，資質亦美，出校後，竟淪爲掃邊，殊堪惋惜。德咸之戲，愚所見甚多，以「春香鬧學」之陳最良，」四郞探母」之楊延昭，「珠簾寨」之程敬思，「玉堂春之劉秉彝爲最滿意。此豸與吳素秋配戲最久，對伊之小本戲，尤爲嫻熟，此次素秋携之俱來，實計之所得。</p>
<p>賈多才　爲彩旦名手，演婆子戲確是一絕，此人曾數度來滬，滬人士知之已稔。花旦王秀雯，爲後起一雋才，惟愚未見其人。此外尙有一凈角洪德佑，亦戲校所滿科者，「金沙灘」一劇，乃德佑之傑作也。</p>
<h3>周信芳病狀</h3>

<h3>露薏斯蕾納</h3>
<p>— 莎薇</p>
<p>露薏斯蕾納，這位以演「歌舞大王齊格飛」而奠定基礎的女藝人，她曾經得了好幾次「奧司卡」金像獎，擁有數十萬觀衆，是一個很受歡迎的影星。自從她的「藝苑之花」，「翠堤春曉」，「玩偶夫人」和我們相見後，關於她的消息好像很沉寂，直到最近才聽說有一張新片到滬，片名暫譯爲「巴黎熱女郞」。</p>
<p>據說露薏斯的出身是不大好的，在她沒有成名之前，一日三餐常有靑黃不接之慮，所以當她在戲裏演那些苦女孩的時候，也就比別人來得逼眞。</p>
<p>而且因爲出身貧賤，對於窮人的苦楚非常同情，常常幫着他們做些自己經濟力量上做得到的事。</p>
<p>正因爲這個緣故，有人說她是共產黨員，也有人甚至於說爲了是共產黨員，所以常在戲裏演那種平民角色，如果眞的如此說，那是非常錯誤的，露薏斯所飾的角色，還不是影片公司裏派給她的嗎？</p>
<p>她在十六歲那年就跨上了舞臺，起先她並不想上銀幕，直到看了漢倫海司所主演的一張名片，才對它發生興趣，並且和米高梅影片公司簽訂合同。當她剛到好萊塢時（露薏期本是奧國人），英語是不大高明的，所以她在那裏請個先生把英語講得流利了再上銀幕。</p>
<p>在好萊塢的星羣中，她確是一個很會演戲的演員，她曾經說「要做個演員，她或他的臉皮就非常像橡皮樣厚不可，」這正可表出她以往的內心痛苦，也可說是她的成功秘訣。至於她的獲獎作是一歌舞大王齊格飛」及「大地」。</p>

<h3>Vietnamese Governor-General Assures China: No Japanese Troops Allowed to Pass Through to Invade Yunnan; Hong Kong Reports Japanese Troops Preparing to Land in Vietnam Tomorrow; Vietnamese and Chinese Governments Have Agreed on Response Measures</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: According to sources from Chinese in Kwangchow Bay, the Japanese fleet is currently cruising off the coast of Vietnam, blockading the entire northeast coast. Haiphong has become an active center. French and indigenous troops are being deployed to defend key coastal points. The French authorities are preparing to evacuate French women and children from coastal towns. The French authorities have imposed strict censorship on telegrams. Furthermore, according to Chinese sources, the Vietnamese authorities have agreed with the Chongqing government on a plan to be adopted in the event of a Vietnamese invasion. It is reported that Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux has assured Chongqing that, under no circumstances, will Japanese armed forces be allowed to pass through Vietnam to invade Yunnan, nor will Japan be allowed to establish a base in Vietnam. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: According to information received here from well-informed sources, the Japanese ultimatum demanding permission for troops to pass through Vietnam has now been withdrawn. It is reported that discussions between the French authorities and the Japanese inspection team are continuing today in Hanoi. However, the tension caused by the French rejection of the Japanese demand remains acute. Last night, Saigon radio announced the temporary suspension of scheduled railway services. According to a reliable observer who arrived in Hong Kong from Vietnam yesterday, the Japanese had previously notified the Vietnamese authorities that Japanese troops would land there on Friday, September 6th. The leader of the Japanese inspection team in Vietnam, Nishihara, informed the Vietnamese government that, after the unsatisfactory response from Vichy regarding Japan's demands, Japan must take the initiative in landing troops. This action would be tantamount to an invasion. According to sources from Chinese in Kwangchow Bay, Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux has agreed with the Chinese government on measures to be taken by the Chinese and French authorities in the event of such an invasion. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Rangoon: The Vietnamese French authorities and Japanese representatives resumed negotiations in Hanoi today. It is reported that the chairman of the Japanese delegation, General Nishihara, has not insisted that Vietnam accept the terms of the Japanese ultimatum. According to a Saigon communiqué issued yesterday, Japan presented an ultimatum on Sunday demanding permission for Japanese troops to pass through Vietnam, which the Vietnamese French authorities rejected. Subsequently, dispatches from Hong Kong reported that Japanese troops were preparing to land in Vietnam on September 6th. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: It is reported that Japan is now preparing to send troops to land in Vietnam on September 6th. According to news obtained from travelers arriving here today, the head of the Japanese mission sent to Vietnam, General Nishihara, has notified the Vietnamese government that, after receiving an unsatisfactory response from Vichy regarding Japan's demands, Japan has decided to take preliminary action on September 6th by sending troops to land. According to a Saigon official gazette published yesterday, Japan presented an ultimatum on the 1st of this month demanding permission for Japanese troops to pass through Vietnam, which has been rejected by the Vietnamese French authorities. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: This morning, all newspapers prominently published the official announcement that Japan has presented Vietnam with an ultimatum demanding that troops be allowed to pass through. All Chinese are eagerly awaiting further developments. It is recalled that Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui issued a declaration on August 28th stating that if Japanese troops landed in Vietnam, the Chinese authorities were determined to take defensive measures and send troops into Vietnam. At the time, as there were no reports of extraordinary developments, this declaration caused some surprise. However, in order to clarify China's attitude towards a possible Japanese invasion of Vietnam, China decided to issue this declaration. The only Chinese news regarding the Japanese-Vietnamese negotiations stated that the Vietnamese authorities agreed to supply Japan with rice, coal, rubber, and other raw materials, but demanded in exchange the restoration of French railway transport and a guarantee that Japan would not take any military action in Vietnam. It is reported that Japan had proposed several conditions before agreeing to restore railway commercial freight, which are currently under discussion. Since the news of the Japanese ultimatum has been confirmed, the situation in Vietnam has completely changed. People here are concerned that if Japan invades Vietnam, the war may quickly spread to the South China Sea. Although the Chinese authorities hope that the outcome of this ultimatum will not lead to war between Japan and Vietnam, they believe that a peaceful resolution is unlikely, as the issue is now beyond the control of the Vietnamese authorities. It is believed here that if Vietnam allows Japanese troops to pass through, Chinese troops will enter Vietnam to defend the border. However, on the other hand, if Vietnam rejects Japan's demands, Japanese troops will land on September 6th. At that time, regardless of what decision the Vietnamese authorities make, war within Vietnam will be difficult to avoid. Details of China's plans to deal with the situation have not yet been announced, but it is reported that the Supreme Command has long since completed preparations. Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin recently flew to Yunnan Province to confer with the provincial chairman, Long Yun, regarding the military measures to be taken in the event of a Japanese invasion of Vietnam. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>The Franco-Japanese Negotiations Have Not Reached a Breaking Point</p>
<p>Saigon: After the Vietnamese French authorities rejected the Japanese demand to allow troops to pass through Vietnam, the entire situation in Vietnam suddenly became tense. Due to strict censorship, it is impossible to ascertain the current situation accurately, or what events will occur in the near future. However, it seems that a breaking point has not yet been reached, because although the Japanese demand has been openly rejected, negotiations between the two sides are still proceeding in a superficially friendly and reasonable manner. Nishihara is still in Vietnam. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Vichy: A semi-official French source quoted a responsible document as saying that negotiations between the French and Japanese governments regarding their respective interests in the Far East have continued for some time and have not been interrupted. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Vichy: Responsible sources here have recently confirmed that the French and Japanese governments are continuing negotiations regarding their respective interests in the Far East. Rumors from foreign sources that the negotiations have been interrupted are untrue. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Japan Denies Issuing Ultimatum to Vietnam</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Japanese Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Army, and Navy recently stated that they had no knowledge of the news reported from Saigon that Japan had sent an ultimatum demanding passage through Vietnam to invade Yunnan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that negotiations between the Japanese delegation in Hanoi and the French authorities were still in progress and had made some progress, but had not yet been completed. Furthermore, French sources here stated that, to their knowledge, the situation had not changed. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Army Department today denied rumors that Japan had presented Vietnam with an ultimatum demanding that Japanese troops pass through Vietnam. A spokesman for the Army Department stated that Japan is currently conducting negotiations with the Vichy government of Pétain regarding various issues related to Vietnam. The fact that the news of this Japanese ultimatum originated in London shows Britain's concern about the outcome of the current Franco-Japanese negotiations. The rumor also stated that the French authorities in Vietnam had rejected Japan's demands. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma stated today when meeting with newspaper reporters that, "We hope that French Indochina will be peaceful and well-governed. Various rumors to the contrary are not credible. We hope that matters can be settled amicably within a few days." He had not received any news of a rebellion in Vietnam. When asked about the negotiations between Japan and the Pétain government, the spokesman replied that the negotiations were currently in progress but had not yet reached the final stage.

<p>Saigon: Reports of a rebellion in French Indochina are completely unfounded. (Reuters, September 4th)</p>
<h3>Zhou Enlai Talks to Reporters: The Entire Nation, Under the Leadership of its Leader, is Growing Stronger in Unity; Northern Warfare Has Been Unfolding for Nearly Half a Month; The Purpose is to Tie Down Japanese Military Strength</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Zhou Enlai, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the General Headquarters, invited many Chinese reporters today to a tea party and gave a speech, stating that the entire nation, under the leadership of its leader, is becoming increasingly resolute in its determination to resist the Japanese, and that unity is becoming more and more consolidated. Regarding rumors that the Japanese army will launch a fall offensive, he observed that the Japanese army is placing its main force on the Sichuan front, which is quite possible. However, the situation from Yichang to Chongqing is different from that from Wuhu to Hankou in the past. It is necessary to have extremely large forces to encircle and outflank on both sides of the Yangtze River in order to succeed. If the Chinese army on all fronts takes a consistent offensive, tying down the Japanese army, then their attempts will inevitably be shattered. Currently, the northern war has been unfolding for nearly half a month. Traffic on the Tianjin-Pukou, Pinghan, Pingsui, Zhengtai, and Datong-Puzhou five railways and eleven highways has been cut off, especially the Zhengtai Railway. This kind of action will be long-term and planned, and its purpose is to tie down Japanese military strength so that they will not be able to prepare to cross the river, let alone draw troops south. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3>Battles on Hainan Island Are Again Becoming Fierce</h3>
<p>Shaoguan: The long-dormant war situation on Hainan Island has recently become active again. According to urgent dispatches from Xuwen: (1) A unit of Japanese troops from Fanlan Port in Wenchang County advanced along the Wenmai Highway towards Huiwen Yandun City on the morning of the 21st. After being fiercely attacked by the defending Chinese troops, they retreated along the original route. (2) A unit of Japanese troops from Wenchang harassed Guannan City. The Chinese army ambushed a surprise force at Xiaozhe. When the Japanese passed by, they launched a coordinated attack, cutting the Japanese into several segments, causing many casualties. (3) On the 17th, Japanese troops from Dan County harassed Dacheng Township. Two days later, the Japanese reinforced and attacked again. The defending Chinese troops calmly resisted and finally drove them back. In this battle, more than 300 Japanese were killed, and many military supplies were captured. (3rd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Invading Phoenix Mountain Severely Defeated by China</h3>
<p>Liuzhou: On the 29th, Japanese troops from Changdun ventured to invade from Daming Village to the western foothills of Phoenix Mountain on the evening of the 29th. The various Chinese armies immediately surrounded the Japanese and attacked from all sides. In the fierce battle until 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 1st, the Japanese corpses were scattered all over the field and were on the verge of collapse. China is intensifying its efforts to annihilate them. (4th)</p>
<h3>National Defense Council Standing Committee Resolves to Establish a Jin-Shaan Supervisory Envoy Office to Promote Supervisory Work in the Northwest Key Points</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Supervisory Yuan, headed by President Yu, believes that Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces are located in key points in the Northwest. In order to promote supervisory work, he specifically submitted a request to the National Defense High Council to establish a Shanxi-Shaanxi Supervisory Envoy Office, which has been approved for establishment by the Standing Committee of the Council.

<h3>American Banking Circles Deny Lending Huge Sums to China</h3>
<p>New York: Private bankers here recently dismissed as laughable the reports from Hong Kong that Soong Tzu-wen had reached an agreement with the United States on a loan of US$135,000,000. They said that Soong had indeed resided in Washington for several weeks to discuss this loan, but according to well-informed banking circles, Soong's efforts were unsuccessful.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Ideals and Sacrifice</h3>
<p>Besides the many well-known reasons for the defeat of Britain and France by Germany this summer, one point that must be pointed out is the difference in the mental state of the two sides; All the different diplomatic applications and the disparity in military mobilization should be analyzed from a mental perspective to find an accurate explanation. For the past twenty-five years, Germany's only ideal has been how to get rid of the shackles of Versailles, recover lost homeland, and realize the unity of the Germanic nation. Because of this, the German people willingly endured the severe rule of the Nazis; and the Nazi authorities, in order to express their ambitions and ideals, did not hesitate to use all means to achieve them. This situation is in stark contrast to the hesitation and wavering of Britain and France. In particular, in the past ten years, the foreign policies of Britain and France have almost completely lacked unified and consistent steps and stances; their response to Germany and Italy has been sometimes appeasement and sometimes sanctions. They lacked firm confidence in establishing a peace front, and they lacked substantial preparation for the prospects of a major war. Their people were even more accustomed to enjoying pleasure and comfort, relying on the aftermath of victory. This situation was especially true in France, so France suffered the most terrible defeat in the war. These extreme drawbacks of realistic spirit are the main reasons why Britain and France suffered disastrous defeats before.</p>
<p>Since France surrendered and Britain fell into a lonely struggle, the United States felt deeply stimulated, and its military build-up began to be promoted on an unprecedented scale and speed. In addition to material construction, considerable attention has also been paid to the mental aspects. In his opening speech at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park on the 2nd of this month, President Roosevelt specifically addressed the above-mentioned weaknesses and loudly appealed that those who specialize in ridiculing ideals, despising sacrifices, and are satisfied with merely satisfying their current lives are tantamount to enemies hidden in the country. Roosevelt's statement, on the one hand, was indeed a punishment for the failures of Britain and France, but on the other hand, it was also because the same weaknesses existed in the United States itself. In the United States, so-called isolationists are actually another form of realists. The mockers of ideals and despisers of sacrifices that President Roosevelt criticized are undoubtedly mainly aimed at isolationists. Although these people in the international community are not as obviously sinful as the policy of appeasement, they are also major enemies of justice and security.</p>
<p>Progress is an important factor for human survival, and ideals are the beacons that lead human progress, and the extinction of ideals will inevitably lead to social stagnation and even regression. However, in the process of promoting the realization of ideals, it is inevitable that a considerable price must be paid. In feudal times and religious life, ideals were supremely revered, and sacrifice was a precious virtue. Since the industrial revolution, individualism has developed along with capitalist economy. The social institutions of the old era have collapsed, and the ideology of the world has also undergone changes. As a result, money has banished ideals and creeds, enjoyment has replaced the spirit of martyrdom, and those who are addicted to ideals and justice have often become the object of ridicule. In this way, personal happiness has indeed increased to double the previous era, but the interests of the entire population have been eroded invisibly. The industrial revolution originally represented the progress of human socio-economic conditions, but only the above point is a side that can be cursed. When this phenomenon is further reflected in the political arena, it forms realism and appeasement policy. Everything is only focused on current interests, regardless of right and wrong in principle, and pursues momentary security, regardless of future interests. Over the past decade, the entire world has fallen into war and the previously established foundation of security has been completely lost. The cause and effect have been clearly demonstrated in the eyes of the people; but in fact, it has not yet been finally settled. Therefore, today, the spirit of martyrdom that is willing to sacrifice everything for the pursuit of the highest ideal has a special need to be emphasized.</p>
<p>It is said that the reason why ideals are often criticized and despised is nothing more than because they are empty and have no practical relevance; in fact, if that is the case, it can only be regarded as fantasy rather than ideal. The so-called ideal must have rationality and practicality, and it is definitely not an aerial castle that is formed by thinking alone. But on the other hand, all ideals must be revisions and even reforms of reality, so they will inevitably encounter resistance, and sacrifice becomes necessary. The reason why people ridicule ideals, in a word, is simply because of their fear of sacrifice. In fact, everything in the world needs to pay a considerable price. The more extravagant the hope, the greater the price. It is not only the pursuit of lofty principles that is true. If you are lazy and afraid of difficulties, and only want to gain without effort, the only future is bound to be a tragic failure or decline. The same is true for individuals and countries. The rise and fall of Germany and France has provided a very obvious example. In addition to the serious warning from the President of the United States, not only Americans, but all people and politicians in the world should learn from this. And in China, which is fighting for freedom and independence, if there are also those who covet security, fear sacrifice, and despise lofty ideals, it is hoped that they can wake up with a start.</p>
<h3>Epoch-Making Grand Action: US and UK Sign Naval Agreement: Exchanging Destroyers for Leases on British Territories: Strengthening Defenses without Threatening Other Countries</h3>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt sent a message to Congress announcing the lease of naval and air bases in British territories in the Western Hemisphere in exchange for fifty US destroyers exceeding their service life. He stated that this matter does not hinder the United States' position of not knowing war, and it is not a threat to any country. This is an epoch-making grand action in the defense preparations of the Americas in the face of a serious crisis. The preparation of defense is a privilege that no sovereign country gives up. The use of this privilege in the current environment is necessary to maintain our security. The United States has adopted a national defense plan since the Louisiana Purchase (referring to the United States' purchase of the French territory west of the Mississippi River from Napoleon), which, like today, is based on the consideration of American security and protection against foreign attacks. Today's move is the most important act of the plan. The value of the American coastal security outpost line to the Western Hemisphere is incalculable. All those responsible for regulating and organizing the sea and land defenses of the United States have long recognized the need for this outpost line, because it is necessary to protect the Panama Canal, Central and South America, and the coasts of the Antilles, Canada, and the Gulf of Mexico. Its important relationship with Western Hemisphere defense is very clear. For this reason, I am taking this opportunity to obtain it.</p>
<h3>US-UK Agreement Can Be Implemented Immediately, No Need to Pass Through US Congress</h3>
<p>The President, in his message, announced the opinion of Attorney General Jackson on the President's authority to implement this agreement. According to rumors here, this agreement can be implemented immediately without the need for Congressional legislation. President Roosevelt said on his way to Washington that the main value of this naval observation base is that the United States can keep the enemy out of the door. The President declined to comment on the possibility of taking further steps in the future to acquire distant bases to protect the Western Hemisphere. When reporters asked whether the current US-UK agreement would be the prelude to the establishment of US bases in Greenland, the President replied that he believed that reporters should not publish comments that other events would originate from this. The President also said that US destroyers will be handed over to the UK in a reasonably short period of time. When reporters asked whether some destroyers were already on their way to the UK, the President replied that he did not want to say, and that he did not know where the ships were currently located. The United States cannot send the ships to the UK. The President's last statement was probably to explain that the destroyers must be sailed to the UK by British or Canadian crew members. British Prime Minister Churchill's announcement, through his ambassador to the United States, that Britain would never abandon or sink the British fleet, has prompted reporters to speculate on whether the bases now acquired by the United States could be used by British ships in the future. President Roosevelt was unwilling to discuss this, saying only that he believed that the British fleet would go wherever defense required. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt said when reporting the resale of warships to Congress that the bases in Newfoundland and Bermuda had been generously granted by Britain, and that the other bases had been exchanged for fifty destroyers. In this agreement with Britain, the United States obtained the right to lease Newfoundland, Bermuda, the Bahamas, Jamaica, St. Lucia, Antigua, and British Guiana. The lease term for the above bases is ninety-nine years. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<h3>London Announces Treaty Contents, Sends Experts to Demarcate Boundaries Immediately</h3>
<p>London: This official site recently stated that the British-American naval treaty was signed in Washington on September 2, stipulating that 50 US destroyers would be delivered to the UK immediately, and that the UK would lease some naval and air bases in British territories off the North American coast to the United States for a period of ninety-nine years. The agreement is attached to a document stating that the British and American governments have discovered a practical method during negotiations that can materially and efficiently assist the defense needs of both parties. Reuters learned that British crew members will sail these destroyers across the Atlantic to the UK. On September 2, British Ambassador to the United States Lothian sent a public letter to US Secretary of State Hull, stating that since the British government has a basic friendship with the United States and a sympathetic concern for American security, and wants to strengthen the US government With the practical cooperation of the United States and other American countries, we can strengthen the ability to consolidate the defense of the Western Hemisphere, so we are unconstrained and have no worries. We are willing to grant the United States the right to lease. It is said that the United States will immediately establish a naval and air base on the Avalon Peninsula, the south coast of Newfoundland, and the east coast and Great Bay of Bermuda. Enjoy the convenience of entering and leaving each of these places for protection. The British government also recognizes the United States' desire to continue to acquire naval and air bases in the Caribbean Sea and in British Guiana. It allows the United States to immediately establish and enjoy a naval and air base in the eastern Bahamas, the south coast of Jamaica, the west coast of St. Lucia, the west coast of Trinidad, Ballya Bay, Antigua, and British Guiana within 50 miles of Georgetown. The British government does not want to place a monetary or transactional value on the many obvious and hidden rights and assets related to this, but wants to exchange it for the military equipment and raw materials that the United States will give to the British government. The lease term for the above bases is ninety-nine years. Except for the compensation for private landlords agreed upon by both parties, rent and other expenses are exempted. In the lease to be agreed upon by both parties, the British government is willing to allow the United States to enjoy various rights in the territorial sea and territorial scope necessary for access to and protection of the bases it leases and near these bases. The exact location and boundaries of each base will be determined through changes. The British government is ready to send experts immediately to work with American experts to handle this matter. US Secretary of State Hull gladly accepted the British proposal in his reply, and declared that the US government was willing to immediately hand over to the British government 50 US naval destroyers of what is generally called the 1,200-ton type. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>US to Expand Leasing Scope, Destroyer Transfer to Begin Next Week</h3>
<p>Charlestown: President Roosevelt hinted to the outside world yesterday that, after the establishment of this British-American agreement, there will be a future expansion of the scope of leasing, so that the number of naval and air force bases in the Western Hemisphere will be more numerous, and the defense of the United States will be strengthened. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington: US Secretary of State Hull recently stated that the British government will receive the first batch of 50 destroyers promised to be transferred by the United States within a few days. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Ottawa: The Canadian Department of National Defence recently announced that the transfer of 50 US destroyers to Britain will soon be held in various Canadian ports. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington: The US destroyers handed over to Britain under the British-American naval treaty will be handed over immediately. According to the announcement of the US Navy Department, of the 50 destroyers, the first eight to be handed over to Britain are already in Boston and should be ready for handover next Friday. These eight will be sailed to Canada by current crew members, and then received by British crew members. Thereafter, batches of destroyers, each with eight, will be handed over successively every half month. The ships will be fully armed, such as guns, cannons, torpedo tubes, anti-aircraft guns, machine guns, etc. will be handed over. At current prices, the value of the destroyers is US$85 million. The US naval tactician Stark has proven that the transfer of US destroyers and the acquisition of defensive bases not only do not reduce but strengthen US defense. Therefore, the legal procedures required for the disposal of destroyers have now been fulfilled. US naval officer Forrestal has appointed a committee of seven to work with British experts to determine the exact location of the bases provided by Britain. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>Similar Negotiations Taking Place Between the US and Canada: Canada Actively Developing Military Industry</h3>
<p>London (Reuters Dispatch) – A diplomatic correspondent for Reuters says that the establishment of the Anglo-American naval agreement is sure to garner immense satisfaction from all levels of British society. Britain will obtain the destroyers it needs for escort duty, to cope with submarines and keep shipping lanes open. The United States will gain the convenience of naval and air bases in places like the Panama Canal Zone for 99 years. This kind of lease does not infringe upon sovereignty, as the British Prime Minister has previously stated. The United States and Canada are conducting similar negotiations regarding ***[unclear text in original]***. This Anglo-American agreement can be said to achieve three primary objectives: (1) The British Navy promptly receives fresh reinforcements to carry out its mission of maintaining Atlantic traffic. (2) It aids American security, which the people of the British Empire consider extremely important. (3) It strengthens the defenses of the Western Hemisphere. This agreement is extremely important and could not have been achieved without mutual trust and goodwill from both sides. Therefore, it can be regarded as proof of democratic nations safeguarding their common interests. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Ottawa – The general public in Canada has expressed its pleasure with the Anglo-American naval agreement, and believes that this agreement will enable the United States to gain a clearer understanding of the problems faced by the British Empire in its war against totalitarianism. Many people in Canada say that this recent move is the best action the United States could take to aid the Allied war effort, short of sending an expeditionary force. With the United States establishing forward bases in the Western Hemisphere and forming a permanent joint defense committee to study US-Canadian joint defense, Canada, like Britain, will quickly become an impregnable fortress, able to produce war materials without obstruction and send expeditionary forces to attack Hitler's controlled territories. Canadian Minister of Munitions and Supply Howe stated today that Canada is rapidly expanding its industrial development program to meet wartime demands for guns, artillery, and materials. Soon, approximately 17.5 million dollars will be spent to build three new factories, which will begin operations next year, employing tens of thousands of people to manufacture chemicals, artillery, and rifles. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>Many US Legislators Express Approval</h3>
<p>Washington – With the exception of a small number of isolationists, members of Congress have largely commented on the Anglo-American naval agreement with approval. Democratic Senator Swartz stated, "Britain is currently fighting for us, so I support giving them any assistance we can." Senator Minton stated, "This agreement not only helps Britain but also gives us the bases we desperately need." Senator Barkley stated that the Anglo-American agreement does not require Congressional approval and anticipates that the public will fully support this approach. Isolationist Senator Nye, referring to the opinion expressed by the Attorney General that Congressional legislation is not required for passage, stated that American leaders are gradually adopting dictatorial practices, disregarding laws and treaties in the name of urgency. Senator Clark stated that the transfer of destroyers is tantamount to an act of war. Congressman Waizwei stated that while Congress acknowledges the value of the new bases, it will not allow the transfer of destroyers.

<h3>Strong Public Resentment Against Territorial Cession: Tense Situation in Romania: Patriotic Soldiers Willing to Fight for Freedom: Serious Border Conflicts Again Arise Between Hungary and Romania</h3>
<p>New York – The *New York Times*'s dispatch from Rome states that the situation in Romania is becoming increasingly tense, and all telephone communications have been cut off. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Grus – Yesterday, as a result of the opposition of Romanians throughout Outer Transylvania to ceding territory to Hungary, conflicts occurred in several small towns in the Satu Mare region south of the Romanian-Soviet border in Ruthenia. As a result, 80 Romanian soldiers and farmers died, and 100 Hungarians died. Senior Romanian officials here regard this conflict as a localized incident, and they believe that Romanian resistance will soon be extinguished. According to members of the royal family residing here, Hungarian troops have entered Outer Transylvania from the far north of Satu Mare, but have not yet advanced to the location where the two armies are engaged in battle. Meanwhile, over a hundred members of the 87th Romanian Infantry Regiment, carrying rifles and machine guns, who were left behind here, are currently leading guerrilla warfare. In addition, another group of 25 soldiers deserted their ranks to join the ranks of 100 members of the 817th Infantry Regiment. According to the captain, they will fight for the freedom of Outer Transylvania. It is said that many Romanian officials have also submitted their resignations in order to join the "rebels" in battle, but this has not been permitted by the authorities. Romanian soldiers carrying automatic rifles and machine guns established a circular line of defense in the workers' district of Grus yesterday, which accounts for over 15% of the city's population. This measure was taken because the authorities received information that Communist leaders are currently leading demonstrations against the government and the royal family. Armed soldiers closely guarded a certain shoe store, because it was reported that the store was actually a Communist base. At the same time, a Hungarian journalist, Karli Ritztai, was shot and killed on Monday evening, but he had first opened fire on a Romanian major general. It is said that Karli Ritztai, lying in a transport vehicle, opened fire on Romanian soldiers who were trying to arrest him, and the Romanian soldiers returned fire, killing him. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Rome – The unease and opposition caused by the Vienna arbitration on the cession of Romanian territory gradually subsided yesterday, but reports of conflicts occurred on the northwestern frontier.

<p>Demonstrations Spread Across the Country: Leaflets Distributed Urging the King to Abdicate</p>
<p>Rome – Yesterday, countless people in the city distributed leaflets in the streets demanding the abdication of Romanian King Carol. Prior to this, someone fired several shots with a handgun at the guards in front of the palace to express resistance to the government. Reliable sources stated that the shooting occurred in front of the palace, but the rioters did not intend to attack the Romanian king. Two guards were immediately injured. Police stated that they immediately brought the situation under control afterwards. Reliable sources also stated that Iron Guard leader Horia Sima had recently returned from Berlin and joined the cabinet. It is rumored that the actions against the government are naturally led by him. Reliable sources further stated that the demonstrations have now spread throughout the country. The date on the leaflets is September 1, and the paper is very large. It states, "Abdication is the call of the entire country." Demonstrators were dispersed by police patrols carrying rifles and machine guns. A journalist told a United Press reporter that he feared that this reaction would spread to Grus and Brasov, because the telephone lines between the capital and the two cities had been cut off. The leaflets stated that the Iron Guard had decided to continue to extend the rule of the royal family, but Prince Michael must come forward as the monarch. The article also expressed attachment to the Axis powers. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin – Regarding the lies broadcast by certain news agencies about an armed revolution occurring in Romania and an assassination attempt on King Carol, the Romanian Prime Minister's Office declared that during the demonstrations, the telephone company and radio station were occupied by the demonstrators for some time, before they were driven out by the military police, and many people were arrested. The rumors that the demonstrators fired several shots in front of the palace to attempt to assassinate the king originated from this misunderstanding. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Iron Guard Members Arrogant and Unruly: Government Able to Control the Overall Situation</p>
<p>Rome – After extremist elements of the Iron Guard attempted to seize important locations here last night, troops have assembled and are on standby, and all public buildings are heavily guarded. Although Rome appears quite peaceful on the surface, it is extremely tense beneath the surface. Air raid sirens sounded inexplicably at 1:30 AM. In the evening, leaflets issued by the Iron Guard were found in various streets and markets. The government has issued a new order prohibiting the organization of political parties and demonstrations, and violators will be immediately detained in concentration camps. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Rome – A correspondent in Rome reported that someone distributed leaflets in the streets of Rome last night demanding the abdication of King Carol, signed by Horia Sima, a prominent member of the Iron Guard. However, the authorities immediately took action to stop the distribution of these leaflets. Today, the Romanian government has been able to control the overall situation and restore order. It is believed that although many members of the Iron Guard support these near-rebellious acts, not all members have adopted this attitude. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Germany Quietly Observes the Development of the Situation: Still Concerned About the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Rome – Senior German figures here told a United Press reporter last night that German troops will not enter Outer Transylvania unless a real war breaks out between Romania and Hungary. These figures stated, "We do not regard the current conflict as a war." Hungarian figures here assured a United Press reporter that "Hungarian troops will definitely not risk going to war against Romania." They stated, "Hungary has accepted the arbitration of the Axis powers, and the negotiations should naturally be carried out by the Axis powers." At the same time, demonstrations by Romanian nationalists have reached their peak. On Monday evening, demonstrators again stormed the German consulate in Brasov. According to eyewitnesses, these people tore down a German flag from a German official vehicle from the car. A Romanian cabinet member told a United Press reporter that he doubted whether the Romanian authorities could stop the anti-German and anti-Italian demonstrations. He admitted, "If the government cannot stop this movement, German troops may occupy Outer Transylvania." When asked how he guessed the Soviet Union's attitude would react when German troops occupied Outer Transylvania, he said, "You must know that the Soviet Union is not asleep, wait and see."

<h3>Japan Plans to Establish a General Council: Promoting the New Political System Movement</h3>
<p>Tokyo – The ultimate goal of the New Political System contains the establishment of a national organization within the scope of the constitutional provisions, but existing political parties and national entities will be asked to dissolve themselves and join the New Political System Movement. Before the organization is established, a New Political System National Council will be established, chaired by Prime Minister Konoe, with headquarters in Tokyo and district branches in each county and city. The General Council will have 300 members, divided into ten departments: General Affairs, Political Affairs, Organization, Parliamentary Affairs, Economy, Culture, Youth, Training, Propaganda, and Eastern Affairs. Headquarters and district branches will serve as a medium of contact between the people and the government, and between the people and the National Diet, county councils, and city councils. The current system will not be changed. The Japanese Emperor will oversee all national affairs. In addition, it is also planned to establish a Supreme Economic Committee and a Supreme Cultural Committee, directly controlled by the Prime Minister. These two committees will be the core of the proposed national organization. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy Minister Resigns</h3>

<h3>Britain Assures US: Fleet Will Never Surrender: Enables US to Maintain Pacific Strength, Respond to Possible Crises in the Far East</h3>
<p>Washington – According to sources here, Britain has declared to the United States that if British warships cannot defend the British Isles and the seas around them, Britain will never allow its fleet to surrender or be scuttled. It is said that Secretary of State Hull sent a letter to British Ambassador Lothian on August 19, asking whether the report that Britain had declared that it would never allow its fleet to be scuttled or surrender was accurate. The British ambassador replied that it was indeed the case. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington – It is widely believed that Britain's assurance to the United States that its fleet would never surrender or be scuttled was a major factor in the US's exchange of destroyers for bases. This allows the United States to maintain its navy in the Pacific, strengthening its ability to respond to possible crises in the Far East. Naval authorities here indicated that once the United States begins to occupy the new bases, Britain may deem it unnecessary to maintain a protective navy in the relevant areas, and British ships can then be transferred to other places in need. Although the use of naval bases must await agreement on restricted locations, it is reported that the US destroyers currently engaged in patrolling may enter them and periodic patrol flights will also begin. According to authorities, all bases have port facilities for cruisers and destroyers, and some already have air bases. The inclusion of US Army officers in the US committee sent to Bermuda indicates that the army may also be stationed in some bases. As for the joint management of the bases by the two countries, it is not a question. Once the United States takes over, the British Navy can only use it within the scope of international law, which stipulates the use of seaports for belligerents. A senior naval officer stated that due to the above restrictions, Britain seems to intend to redistribute its navy in the Atlantic. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<p>Causes and Remedies for Marital Tragedy</p>
<p>The best family system in civilized society is monogamy. A couple, man strong and woman healthy, each fulfills their function. In rural society, the man farms and the woman weaves. In urban society, the man goes out to manage business or industry, and the woman manages household affairs at home. The love between husband and wife is intimate and tender, and the children born are lively and clever. This is of course a harmonious and healthy family. Such a healthy family not only enjoys happiness and joy, but it is also a good and stable foundation for society, which is of great importance to the nation. In our physiological and psychological research, a man and a woman are married because of their physiological needs, and they should harmonize their household, with deep love and joy. Why does tragedy have to happen in the family?</p>
<p>There are many causes of family tragedy, but apart from the man being too greedy, taking one wife, and then wanting a concubine or hiding another in a golden house, as the saying goes, "If you want discord in the family, take a concubine." In addition to adding women and creating chaos, the most common cause is the weakness of the man's sexual function. In our research on female psychology, unless she doesn't marry him, if she marries him, she gives her whole body and mind to him. As long as he can give her full joy and comfort, she will feel that he is the only one who can understand her in her life, so it is said that devoted women are betrayed by heartless men, and women are mostly devoted. However, if a man has committed masturbation or nocturnal emission in his early years, or has been indulgent and promiscuous after marriage, resulting in exhaustion of essence and blood, pathological changes occur in sexual function. In the brain, spinal cord, and nerves, he often feels head swelling, brain pain, forgetfulness, insomnia, tinnitus, blurred vision, mental disorder, back pain, and limb fatigue. How can such a man receive his wife's enthusiasm in marital life? To have one's enthusiasm betrayed is a heartbreaking thing! If she is sacrificed for a long time, how can she not become angry! Perform all kinds of tragedies in the family! In today's society, it is often heard that wives have relationships with others, or openly confront their husbands in court and file for divorce with eloquent words. When such a husband suffers this tragedy, his inner pain, if we think from his perspective, can we not shed tears? At the same time, due to physical weakness, how can he withstand such a serious stimulus? If he is too sad, he may form premature aging, or even die young!</p>
<p>However, smart men, we know that the above-mentioned diseases are not incurable. If treated according to the symptoms, health can be restored. According to world-renowned doctors and my many years of experience, it is generally agreed that taking the "Reproductive Hormone," a preparation made from the gonads of strong animals, is the most effective treatment. This agent can produce sperm, nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, activate blood circulation, and nourish nerves within one day and night after taking it. If it can be taken continuously, it can completely cure the above-mentioned diseases. However, those with nocturnal emission must also take "Simito's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" to consolidate the sperm gate and prevent leakage, and the effect will be even faster.</p>
<h3>Seminal Emission is the Most Harmful Disease to the Body</h3>
<p>— Venereology Specialist Physician Zhan Nian-zeng</p>
<p>Because semen is the source of our life, seminal emission is the most harmful disease to the body. Now let us analyze it in the following points: The semen in a person's body is extracted from the most valuable nutrients in food, and through various subtle physical and chemical processes in physiology, it is produced by the testicles and flows into the seminal vesicles. If the flow is too much, it will indeed present a state of excessive heat and lead to spermatorrhea. Approximately healthy unmarried adult men may experience it once or twice a month. This is physiological and cannot be considered pathological. However, many people develop pathological seminal emission from spermatorrhea through masturbation, or from masturbation or other lustful thoughts. This must be prevented with caution. In short, unless semen is discharged through intercourse, (but excessive indulgence is also not advisable, as excessive indulgence has various drawbacks,) the deep retention of semen in the body is of great benefit to the body. This is because it functions to regulate metabolism, promote development, nourish various nerves, and has various uses such as strengthening the brain and kidneys, and increasing energy. If a young person has seminal emission, or if seminal emission deteriorates into spermatorrhea, then the semen in the body cannot be stored, inevitably leading to depletion of sperm and blood. This results in reduced metabolism, and in the body's various tissues, only old cells die while few new cells are produced, leading to a sallow complexion and thin physique, and reduced vitality. If this continues, premature aging may occur, development may be hindered, leading to short stature and small genitals like a child. In addition, the brain, spinal cord, and sexual nerves will also fall into a state of weakness, often experiencing mental fatigue, forgetfulness, insomnia, tinnitus, blurred vision, back pain, and physical fatigue. Kidney deficiency and impotence may occur, and sperm leakage may lead to loss of focus. Furthermore, the continuous leakage of semen and the body's inability to produce enough semen can lead to a lack of sperm or even complete absence of sperm, resulting in infertility. ... From all of this, we can see that seminal emission not only harms the body but can also lead to infertility, so its danger is significant! As for sexual weakness, which makes marital life unfulfilling, it will create a great tragedy in life! According to world-renowned doctors and my own experience, the only treatment for this condition is to take "Hemetol Pills for Semen Consolidation," which is the most effective. After taking it, it can immediately consolidate the sperm gate, calm the nerves, and eliminate evil thoughts, and seminal emission can be completely eradicated. However, if seminal emission has already caused the above-mentioned symptoms, it is necessary to also take the gonadal hormone preparation "Gonadotropin" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase sperm and blood, nourish the nerves, regulate metabolism, and promote development. With continued use, health can be fully restored soon.</p>
<h3>Look! How Important the Breasts Are</h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei</p>
<p>They actually control a woman's life and destiny</p>
<p>"No matter how beautiful a peony is, it all depends on the green leaves for support." No matter how beautiful a woman is, if she doesn't have a pair of prominent breasts and plump hips to reveal her curvaceous beauty, then even if she wears a brocade robe (cheongsam), adorns herself with precious jewelry, wears sheer stockings, and applies lipstick and makeup, she will still feel that something is missing, just like a peony without green leaves. Not only will she be unable to confidently show off her beauty in social gatherings and will be laughed at, but also in the private life between husband and wife, imagine the appearance of a flat and featureless chest suddenly entering your husband's eyes. What will you feel in your heart at this time? What will your husband feel? I know that even if your husband doesn't say it to your face, his love for you will gradually cool down, or he may even constantly go out to sing and dance, and patronize prostitutes. Although you will be very unhappy, when you think of your own shortcomings, you will have to suffer in silence and feel depressed. Moreover, as a result of breast atrophy, the function of the ovaries, which is related to a woman's overall health, will inevitably become impaired, and the ability of metabolism will also be disrupted. As a result, menstrual irregularities, vaginal discharge, cold uterus and infertility, and decreased libido will inevitably follow one after another, leading to difficult childbirth and ultimately not being able to conceive. Even with millions in assets, you will have to hand them over to others. Thinking about this, breasts are really very important for a woman's happiness.</p>
<p>So, is there really no way to make up for this kind of defect? According to the unanimous opinion of world-renowned physiologist and beauty expert Kang Delin and gynecologist Tang Posheng, if a woman suffers from breast atrophy, small hips, menstrual irregularities, excessive discharge and infertility, and decreased libido, she can take the ovarian preparation for women "Gonadotropin" invented by Austrian Dr. Kidana, which is the most effective treatment for these symptoms. This preparation is made from the essence of animal ovaries through scientific refining. Just imagine: supplementing the ovaries of women with impaired ovarian function with the essence of healthy animal ovaries, no wonder it can exert its great medicinal power overnight after taking it, boosting metabolism, regulating menstruation, warming the uterus and stopping discharge. With continued use, it can make the atrophied breasts gradually become prominent, and the thin hips become plump, and it can also increase blood circulation, making the complexion and skin glow with a fresh red color from the moisturized and fair skin.</p>

<p>Do you want your leucorrhea to get better soon?</p>
<p>When we deal with any matter in society, before we get our hands on it, we may think that this matter is very difficult and not easy to deal with, but the result is that it is resolved very smoothly. There are also times when, before we get our hands on it, we feel that this matter is very clear and can be handled quickly, but the result is that not only can we not get the matter done, but we can't even find a clue. Therefore, I believe that there is absolutely nothing easy or absolutely nothing difficult in the world. This is not only true for any matter in society, but also for the treatment of leucorrhea. For example, many people think that sexual leucorrhea is easy to treat, but there are still so many people suffering from chronic leucorrhea. Have they all gone through the acute phase? As for saying that chronic leucorrhea is difficult to treat, but as far as I am concerned, I have cured no less than six thousand out of every ten people. All of them have been proven to be non-toxic by the health authorities, and they have never relapsed. In short, whether it is acute or chronic, if the physician has rich experience, exquisite surgery, keen eyesight, outstanding equipment, does not exaggerate to deceive people, serves with sincerity, diagnoses accurately, and prescribes the right medicine, even if the symptoms are extremely severe, he can still be sure of success. I guarantee that it will be completely resolved in as little as two weeks or as long as five weeks, and there is absolutely no need to worry about recurrence. If the physician's skills are clumsy, the equipment is incomplete, and he fails to serve with sincerity, then even the first appearance of new leucorrhea, hum; I am afraid that you can forget about getting better in time.</p>

<h3>British Planes Fly Across the Strait, Fiercely Bombarding the French Coast, Bomb Explosions Clearly Audible Across the Sea, Berlin Area Continues to Be Raided by Royal Air Force</h3>
<p>By our correspondent at Wangfo, Yesterday afternoon, anti-aircraft guns were as dense as a string of pearls, with deafening sounds, lasting for more than an hour. I heard that these gun sounds came from the French coast across the Strait, interspersed with a loud bang, which was clearly the sound of bomb explosions. It turned out that the British Royal Air Force was concentrating its bombardment on German gun positions and German forces along the French coast. The sound of explosions in the Calais and Pirodon areas on the other side of the Strait gradually increased, even affecting 20 miles along the French coast. After the sound of explosions stopped, British bombers returned to their bombing targets again to carry out attacks, about sixteen or eighteen times.

A total of 25 German planes were shot down in British airspace. The target of the German planes' two attacks seemed to be British airfields. In the first attack, about 100 to 150 German planes attacked at high altitude over the Thames Estuary. During the first air raid, a newly formed Czech squadron in the British Air Force shot down seven German planes, while the squadron only lost one Czech pilot. It is understood that the squadron has shot down a total of sixteen German planes so far. (Reuters report from the 4th)</p>
<p>London, The Air Ministry and the Ministry of Home Security announced that German planes carried out air raids on Britain last night on a small scale.

There were few casualties in the northwest and northeast. It is also heard that a small number of high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs fell in the Bristol Channel area, but there were no casualties and the losses were also minimal. German planes were also quite active over Wales, but there were no civilian casualties. The air raid alarm was sounded in the London area at 8:20 this morning and was lifted 20 minutes later. Fierce fighting occurred at an altitude of 15,000 feet off the southeastern coast. A large number of enemy planes were attacked by British fighter planes. The enemy planes' formation was disrupted and they fled towards the French coast. (Reuters report from the 4th)</p>

<h3>Chinese Troops in Shanxi, Repeatedly Capture Strongholds</h3>
<p>Xingji, On the evening of the 27th of last month, the Chinese general Bei Hai-du (north of Xiyang) recovered. On the evening of the 28th, he also occupied Yaodi, capturing many enemy soldiers. On the morning of the 29th, two units of Japanese troops from Xiyang launched an attack and engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army in the Yangjiafeng area. Zanggangkou, north of Liaoxian, was also captured by the Chinese on the evening of the 27th. The Chinese army also launched an attack on the northern suburbs of the county seat, annihilating many Japanese soldiers and capturing one Japanese soldier. (Telegram from the 3rd)</p>
<p>Luoyang, In recent weeks, the Chinese troops in Shanxi, Henan, and Hebei have achieved great results, especially in the border area of Shanxi and Hebei, where they have won an unprecedented victory, dealing a great blow to the Japanese troops in North China. Since the Chinese army launched a counterattack on the Pinghan and Zhengtai lines, they have destroyed more than a dozen iron bridges south of Baoding on the Pinghan line, as well as many rails and power lines, and have also captured Fangshunqiao Station. At the same time, they cut off the highways on both sides of the railway and launched a converging attack on the Japanese strongholds, killing more than a thousand Japanese soldiers. The Zhengtai Chinese army has also been very active recently. On the evening of the 20th, they launched a fierce attack on Niangziguan, fighting bloodily for several days and nights. They finally recovered the pass on the morning of the 23rd and completely destroyed the Jingxing coal mine, blowing up all the mine shafts and machinery. The Japanese industry has suffered a major blow. The Chinese army west of Zhengtai took the opportunity to launch a large-scale attack on the Japanese troops in Pingding, Yangquan, and Shouyang, fighting fiercely for days. The Japanese troops were attacked from both east and west and were unable to hold out. The Chinese army then captured Potou and Shitong stations in one fell swoop and recovered the nearby strongholds one after another. The Japanese army, seeing the serious situation, urgently transferred troops from southern Shanxi to reinforce. The Chinese army is still continuing to attack the Japanese troops. The heavy damage caused by this large-scale counterattack on the Pinghan and Zhengtai lines has not been seen in months. The Japanese transportation has been cut off and has not been able to resume for many days. Although there have been no fierce battles in southern Shanxi in recent days, there have been small skirmishes almost every day. The Japanese troops east of Wenxi and Xiaxian have been swept away by the Chinese army. At the same time, the encirclement of the Japanese troops on the Zhangmao Highway has yielded quite a few gains. Most of the Japanese troops in northern Henan are still concentrated in the Qinbo area. A unit had previously moved north to reinforce Pinghan. In recent days, the Chinese army has carried out flanking attacks in the western section of the Daoqing Railway and attacked the Japanese troops in Qinbo. In eastern Henan, the fighting has been silent recently. The main forces of the Chinese and Japanese armies are still holding their original positions. Overall, the Chinese army has an absolute advantage in Shanxi and Henan. They have been able to make thorough deployments and agile actions in various strongholds and carry out decisive counterattacks. Therefore, the evolution of the war situation will become more and more favorable to China. (Telegram from the 3rd)</p>

<h3>The Down-and-Out Youth Hitler</h3>
<p>After his mother's burial, he took the remaining money and returned to Vienna. In a few months, this young man, who was unwilling to obey his father's order to become a government official, became increasingly degenerate, reaching the lowest levels of the economy and society. From the age of twenty to twenty-three, the young Hitler lived a vagrant life. He stayed in a small inn in Vienna, and every day he went to the church for a bowl of free soup. In the winter, he swept snow for others. His enemies later exaggerated and embellished how miserable he was during this down-and-out period. Some people heard that he had worked as a bookbinder or a painter, and some even said that he had some physiological defects and was like an idiot, and that he might go crazy at any time. In fact, these were nothing more than made-up jokes. In short, at this time, he was very unsuccessful, failing at everything he did, and often blaming others. He became more and more dissatisfied with the world, which was the truth.</p>
<p>In the months before he began his vagrant life, he had worked as a brick carrier for a construction company in Vienna. At that time, he told himself and those who were willing to listen to him with a proud attitude that he was willing to do this job well and work his way up to become an architect. He dressed like a student and had the appearance of "a crane standing among chickens." His companions asked him to join the union, but he refused. At meal times, he ate only milk, bread, and cheese, and did not drink beer. The other workers found him very strange and used many words to test the truth about him. They explained their political ideas on national affairs and diplomacy. From the workers' point of view, they were all socialists who were not very clear about their own ideas. They attacked capitalists and bureaucrats; they also discussed religion and various moral issues.</p>
<p>Hitler's understanding of their arguments was rather vague, which was not surprising, because he was still a young man with limited knowledge. He opposed the middle class, opposed the dictatorship of the common people, or a workers' government, but did not know what he believed in. He dreamed of a strong and great German Federation so that he would not be ashamed to be a citizen of this country. At lunchtime, he would often squat on the scaffolding, silently listening to the workers' arguments. Suddenly, in a state of excitement and with nervous emotions triggered by a hateful psychology, he would give a loud speech to the workers. Although he tried his best to convey his deep and strong emotions, he always failed to express himself clearly. Simply because he was only twenty years old, did not read much, had no central ideas, and did not know how to stir people up, he did not arouse anyone's attention. Soon, the workers not only ridiculed him but also showed their dislike for him. One day, he was giving a torrent of speech when he was interrupted by his companions, who told him to leave immediately and not come back, otherwise they would beat him off the scaffolding. He was rejected by this group of first-time listeners and had to leave.</p>
<p>His vagrant life began from then on. However, the period of Hitler's diligent reading in his life also began at this time. Because he was humiliated by the workers on the scaffolding, his reading had its own unique perspective: first, he wanted to restore his self-esteem and use facts and rational principles to support his emotions; second, he wanted to realize the idea of a Greater Germany in his mind and did not want to end his life as a vagrant or an ordinary worker. He advocated reading for practical purposes. This young Adolf buried himself in hard reading every day, using his companions in the small inn as opponents for debate. His personal view of the world gradually took shape from this, and he regarded it as his own savior of self-esteem. He was penniless and starving. Once he started his self-study work, he first read Marx's works and concluded that the mastermind behind the union was the Communist Party. He hated the union deeply. Later, he read books about Jews; he thought that the Jews were the mastermind behind the Communist Party. The middle class he hated, with its bureaucratic habits, and the educational system they set, which prevented him from becoming an architect, were all the fault of these Jews. What he read and thought about was mostly like this.</p>
<p>Hitler lived in a small inn, making a living by painting postcards sporadically, which a friend helped him sell on the street. Sometimes, he painted a large watercolor painting and put it next to the stove in the public room to dry it, which not only made the paint dry easily but also covered the picture with a layer of yellow, making it look like an ancient painting from many years ago. He randomly chose the name of a painter who was not very famous for decades and signed it in the corner of the painting, and his friend would then take it to the beer hall and sell it to tourists at a high price.</p>
<p>The residents in the small inn were always people who talked a lot. This was the case in any country or any place in the world. The "gentlemen" here were all underfed and poorly clothed; at night, they slept on hard wire mattresses and were only covered with a thin blanket. They took off the clothes they wore during the day, rolled them up, and put them under their heads as pillows. If this group of people were told not to talk, wouldn't they be suffocated? The young Hitler was the most talkative among them. He didn't just talk about politics; he had a lot of topics to talk about. Many friends also liked to listen to his wonderful arguments. Because no matter what, it was better than being hungry and helpless in the corner; and it could also relieve boredom. Hitler told them how they should cooperate with his guidance. He arranged for someone to learn painting, someone to design advertisements, someone to specialize in painting signs, and the rest to go out and sell these things. In this way, everyone could make a living.</p>
<p>He was quick-witted and had many ideas. According to his companion, Mr. So-and-so, Hitler's interesting stories are as follows: One day, Hitler saw an advertisement for hair tonic in the newspaper, which showed a woman with long hair on the ground. The text began by saying, "I, Anna, Kexila... used to be bald, but how I grew a head of black hair by using this hair tonic, so I tried my best to introduce this reliable thing to the public." Hitler's friends took this as the center of discussion, to study whether there was a woman named Anna Kexila, and whether her hair had actually grown back by using this hair tonic. Hitler thought this was obviously a scam, but his friends were a little doubtful, thinking that if the manufacturer of the hair tonic was not sure, how could they come up with an Anna Kexila and say that the hair tonic was effective?</p>
<p>Hitler was indeed clever. He said without a doubt that this advertisement was a scam. He said that if his friends agreed, he would also do such a trick to earn some money for them. When they heard this, they couldn't help but light up and hurriedly asked how to do it. Hitler said, "Well, you go and get some old horseshoe-shaped iron cans, fill them with glue, and sell them to the shops, telling them to put the glue on the large glass windows, so that the glass will not crack in cold weather." His friends laughed at him after hearing this. They said, "Where does the glue come from? Don't you need money for glue?" Hitler said, "Don't worry, you can use anything to pretend to be glue - the soup in the kitchen, or more simply, get some lime from the brickyard, mix it with water, and you're done." His friends retorted, "Then it's not glue, how can it prevent the glass from cracking in winter?" Hitler said, "We can sell it in the summer. And tell the shopkeepers that things used in winter are much cheaper if you buy them in summer."</p>
<p>One idea came to Hitler, and another idea came up. He said that banknotes should be made smaller and put in a clear box so that they would be easy to use and not easily broken. His friends said that this was "inconceivable." After everyone talked a lot like this, they prepared to go to sleep. First, they took off their shirts and socks to wash them in preparation for wearing them dry in the morning. Some of them washed their clothes every night, while others washed them occasionally. Hitler was one of those who washed them occasionally. At that time, there was a companion who was a farmer's son from the countryside of Saxony, who often joked, "Hitler is washing his shirt, it must be sunny tomorrow." (To be continued)</p>

<h3>French Concession Under Tight Security, Maintaining Order Within its Borders, Taking the Same Steps as the International Settlement, Rumored to Continue Until September 18th</h3>
<p>The police authorities of the British and French concessions in this city decided to jointly take special security measures at twelve o'clock the night before last, and immediately carried out various security arrangements overnight, which were completed by dawn. By yesterday, iron wire barriers had been placed at all important road intersections in the two concessions, and additional detectives were stationed at the missing places to strictly inspect pedestrians and vehicles. At the same time, patrol teams and armored vehicles from the two concessions were also dispatched one after another, patrolling the roads within the concessions without stopping, so that petty criminals could not move around. All measures were the same as on important commemorative days, and the security measures in the French Concession were even more stringent. The International Settlement, on the other hand, was more moderate. According to informed sources, this security measure will continue for several weeks because the "September 18th" anniversary is approaching. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>French Police Department Explains the Meaning</p>
<p>According to a spokesperson for the French Concession Police Department, the measures taken by the French Concession to set up barbed wire at important intersections have no special significance. The general public in this city has been arguing endlessly about the French Concession's repeated erection of barbed wire obstacles, but the spokesperson solemnly stated that the special security period around the third anniversary of the Battle of Shanghai achieved very good results. Therefore, this is a repeat of those actions. The spokesperson finally stated that the French Concession authorities have no special purpose in re-adopting this measure.</p>
<p>Its function is only to facilitate the search work of the police.</p>
<p>Reasons for Security Measures as Reported by Western Newspapers</p>
<p>The English-language "Ta Mei Wan Bao" stated that the police authorities of the French Concession and the International Settlement have taken security measures within their borders from midnight to today (the 4th), without respite. Reliable sources in this city believe that the reason why the police authorities have taken these security measures is because a certain group intends to carry out retaliatory violence today after the assassination of Liu Na'ou. Shortly after midnight, barbed wire was erected across many thoroughfares in the two concessions, and the number of patrol officers and search teams was greatly increased. They carried out strict searches at night and continued to perform their duties until this morning. It is understood that Liu Na'ou was assassinated at the Jinghua Restaurant on Fuzhou Road at 2:15 p.m. yesterday (the 3rd). It is reported that the police have now detained two suspects who witnessed the shooting.</p>
<p>Temporary Decision Based on Information Obtained</p>
<p>The claim that a certain group intends to carry out retaliatory violence was confirmed this morning by an official from the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department. He said that the police authorities took security measures after receiving information. An official from the French Concession Police Department first said that the security measures taken were "only routine duties," but then immediately admitted that they had cooperated with the police of the International Settlement yesterday evening and taken this action. The reporter then asked Shi Maoru, the deputy police chief of the Shanghai Municipal Council, to explain the reasons for the security measures. Shi admitted that the police department had taken this action after obtaining information, but the information obtained was very concise, and he did not say anything else.</p>
<p>Shops and Lanes Prepared for Search</p>
<p>Although the security measures in the French Concession began on the 31st of last month, they reached an unprecedented level of stringency yesterday. The French defense forces and the French patrolmen and police officers were almost fully mobilized and deployed at the gaps in various roads to strictly enforce the inspection of pedestrians and vehicles. Armored vehicles were more active than before, and patrol teams of five or six people patrolled everywhere from time to time, all armed with live ammunition and fully equipped. Detectives set off to conduct searches in various shops and lanes based on real-time intelligence. In addition, the French Overseas Volunteers, etc., were waiting for orders to be dispatched at any time. All preparations have been completed to fulfill the responsibility of protecting the security of the concession.</p>
<p>The Western District of the International Settlement is the Most Strict</p>
<p>As for the International Settlement, patrolmen have been dispatched to all important roads, such as the gaps along Edward Road and the southern entrances of various bridges on the Suzhou River, to strictly defend them. Patrol teams and armored vehicles have also begun to move around, patrolling everywhere and selectively inspecting pedestrians and vehicles. Yesterday, the area where the security measures were most stringent in the International Settlement was the western district, with a large number of detectives stationed at the road intersections adjacent to the "badlands" of western Shanghai to strictly search pedestrians. Red security vehicles also gathered in the western district to maintain order. There were no reports of foreign defense forces being dispatched in the International Settlement, but the Shanghai Volunteer Corps was on duty as usual.</p>
<p>Iron Wire Obstacles Widely Distributed</p>
<p>All roads in the French Concession along Edward Road have been equipped with barbed wire obstacles, with gaps left only at the Bund, Catholic Church Street, Great World, Ma Huo Road, Sacred Heart Road, Albert Road, and other places to maintain traffic. Henan Road and Dongxinqiao Street, which have never been closed, were also blocked yesterday. In addition, more barbed wire obstacles have been added to various non-essential roads in the central area of the French Concession for immediate use and search. Yesterday, Luban Road and Kangti Road were also barricaded, and the atmosphere in the area remained extremely tense. In the International Settlement, gaps were blocked only at Edward Road, the Bund, Jiangxi Road, Fujian Road, Great World, and other places. There were no changes in other areas.</p>
<p>Armed Japanese Soldiers Enter the French Concession</p>
<p>At around 10:00 a.m. yesterday, six Japanese military police officers wearing yellow cloth uniforms with "Suzuki" signs on their chests were discovered in the Mintiniyin Road area of the French Concession, led by a Japanese person wearing a dark blue suit. Among them, four military police officers had command knives hanging from their waists and wore yellow puttees, while the other two had knives hanging from their waists and water bottles on their backs, and wore yellow cloth leggings. When the French-Vietnamese patrolmen stationed near the Great World saw this, the Fourth Vietnamese patrolman stopped them near the tram stop for questioning. At the same time, the French patrolmen telegraphed the Lujiawan Police Station to request instructions. It was not until half an hour later that they headed south, took the tenth tram at Baxianqiao, and turned west towards Pinban Road. At around 11:00 a.m., the group of seven people returned via French Main Street from the Zhubaoshan Road area. Also, at 10:40 a.m. yesterday, a large contingent of Japanese troops in the Nanshi area boarded ten Japanese military trucks, each carrying about forty or fifty people, and sped north from the Ximen Heping Road through the Nanyang Bridge Iron Gate, Mintiniyin Road, the Great World, and Yu Qiaqing Road, and turned towards Hongkou. It is reported that these Japanese troops were stationed in the Longhua, Minhang, Xujiahui, and Huazhuang areas of Nanshi and were being transferred to Hongkou and Zhabei.</p>
<h3>Admiral Hart Arrives in Shanghai Under City-Wide Security Alert; Sudden Trip, Reasons Unknown; Asiatic Fleet to Concentrate in Shanghai Again</h3>
<p>The English-language "Ta Mei Wan Bao" reported that Admiral Hart, commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, unexpectedly arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao on the US light cruiser Marblehead at 1:00 p.m. today (the 4th). The reason for Admiral Hart's sudden arrival in Shanghai has not been disclosed. It is also expected that the flagship of the Asiatic Fleet, the Augusta, will arrive here in the latter half of this month, and it is expected that other US ships will also come south soon. It is reported that Admiral Hart went to the US Navy Office at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road at around 3:00 p.m. and had a long meeting with Rear Admiral Glassford, commander of the US Yangtze River Fleet, and Colonel Baker, commander of the Shanghai defense forces. The content of the meeting is unknown, but it is generally believed that it must be related to the situation in the concession in this city. Residents of Shanghai have been experiencing a series of assassinations and kidnappings, and it seems that it is not easy to succeed without strengthening the strength of the defense forces of neutral countries and taking strict security measures. Therefore, upon learning of Admiral Hart's arrival in Shanghai, they all expressed their warm and heartfelt joy.</p>
<h3>Jardine Matheson's Tai Sang Arrives in Shanghai from Haiphong Yesterday</h3>
<p>Jardine Matheson's Tai Sang arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. The ship left Haiphong after the blockade on the 26th without being hindered and carried more than 100 passengers from Haiphong to Hong Kong and Shanghai. According to one passenger, he did not see any Japanese ships stationed there when he left Haiphong. The ship is scheduled to sail to Tianjin and other places on the 6th. Jardine Matheson's Yisheng is still stopping in Hong Kong because the Shanghai-Haiphong route has not been restored and is scheduled to sail there this morning. Jardine Matheson's Qiongzhou is scheduled to sail to Luzon and Singapore today, and the news about sailing to Saigon is completely inaccurate. Jardine Matheson's Guiyang has already arrived in Shanghai yesterday and is scheduled to sail to Siam on the 8th. Before the resumption of Shanghai-Haiphong shipping, this route is very beneficial to the city's economy, as the rice and coal needed by the city can be transported from there.</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops Build More Than 20 Forts Downstream of Nanjing; Fierce Fighting with Japanese at Dahekou</h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reported that the Japanese "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" reported yesterday (the 3rd) that more than 20 forts built by Chinese troops have recently been discovered 20 nautical miles downstream of Nanjing, forming a defensive line.

<h3>German Ship Jiangding Suddenly Detained Yesterday Morning; Forced to Sail and Dock Along the Gaocangmiao River; Reasons for Detention Not Announced by Either Party</h3>
<p>The German merchant ship Jiangding, with a load of 198 tons, was chartered by the Tongxing Shipping Company on the second floor of the Hongsheng Building on Sichuan Road, and sailed to the ports of Beisha, Haimen, and Qidong along the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. It had participated in direct shipping to Shanghai and Ningbo once.</p>
<p>(It stopped the day before yesterday) at Pier No. 14 on the Bund of Renji Road, loaded more than 150 tons of sugar, cotton cloth, groceries, etc., and was scheduled to sail to Qinglong Port yesterday morning. Unexpectedly, before setting sail, at about 6:35 a.m. yesterday, several Japanese plainclothesmen suddenly arrived,</p>
<p>(Looking around in all directions) Later, the captain was ordered to cast off the mooring lines and forced to sail south along the Huangpu River and dock along the Gaocangmiao River. When the captain asked the Japanese why he was being detained, the Japanese did not answer. The captain immediately reported to Lihe Foreign Firm and forwarded it to the German consulate for negotiations with the Japanese, but it was not released as of late last night. The truth about the ship's detention is being kept strictly secret by Lihe and Tongxing, and they refuse to announce it.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Telephone Price Increase; Decision Expected by the End of the Month; Whether it Can Be Implemented is Questionable</h3>
<p>In recent days, there have been rumors that the Shanghai Telephone Company will increase telephone rates again. A reporter from Pingming News inquired with the company yesterday afternoon and learned that the company authorities have indeed considered this, and a decision on the price increase will be made before the end of this month. However, the amount of the increase and whether the price increase will be uniform for business, household, and company telephones have not yet been determined. According to sources, since the Shanghai war, Shanghai's blind industries have developed abnormally, and speculative activities are extremely rampant. As a result, the number of telephone users has increased year by year. Recently, the company claimed that the telephone directories have often been revised in a few months. If the price increase is true, whether the municipal authorities will allow it is still questionable.</p>
<h3>Daylight Saving Time to End on a Specific Date; Termination on October 12th</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council implemented daylight saving time in the summer, and it has been three months since then. Now that it is autumn, according to reliable sources, the Municipal Council discussed ending daylight saving time at a board meeting held yesterday and decided to end it on October 12 (Saturday), because the day it started on June 1 was also a Saturday.</p>
<h3>US Lieutenant Colonel Molloy Leaves Shanghai to Return Home; Will Be Promoted After Returning to the US</h3>
<p>The English-language "Ta Mei Wan Bao" reported that US Marine Corps Executive Officer Lieutenant Colonel Molloy, who had been in Shanghai for more than a year, had completed his tour of duty and left Shanghai yesterday (the 3rd) on the President Pierce. It is generally believed that he will be promoted to the rank of colonel after returning to the US. Lieutenant Colonel Molloy temporarily commanded the Fourth Marine Regiment at the end of July last year during the handover between the former commander of the Fourth Marine Regiment, Colonel Fegan, and the current commander, Colonel Baker. Afterwards, he was responsible for intelligence and liaison matters. Lieutenant Colonel Molloy has been in Shanghai for more than a year and has a good reputation in the sports and social circles.</p>
<h3>US Consul in Geneva Transferred to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The English-language "Ta Mei Wan Bao" reported that US Consul Vincent, stationed in Geneva, Switzerland, has been transferred to Shanghai and is expected to arrive here soon. Vincent is not a newcomer to China, having previously studied at the Beijing Language School and worked in the US consulates in Changsha and Hankou.</p>
<p>(US Consul Promoted) The English-language "Ta Mei Wan Bao" reported that US Consul Porter, who temporarily took charge of the affairs of the US Consulate General in this city after the former US Consul General Gauss left Shanghai on April 4 this year, has now been promoted one level and become a second-class consul. The new US Consul General in Shanghai, Lockhart, is scheduled to arrive here on October 20 and will leave Shanghai soon after his arrival.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul General Miura Yoshiaki Transferred to Mexican Envoy; Will Leave Here Soon</h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reported that, according to responsible sources, Japanese Consul General in Shanghai Miura Yoshiaki will be promoted to the rank of minister and may be stationed in Mexico. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo officially announced last night (the 3rd) that Horinouchi Kanekichi will soon succeed Miura's vacancy. It is generally believed that Miura will leave Shanghai soon. Japanese consular officials in this city refused to specify which country Miura would be ordered to serve as envoy, but it is generally believed that he will be sent to Mexico to replace the current minister to Mexico, Koshida.</p>
<h3>Speculative Rice Merchants Disregard Price Limits; Actually Use Gold Prices as a Basis; Disregard Price Limits as Insignificant</h3>
<p>Norwegian-owned "Pulin" ship delivered around 26,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon, arrived in Shanghai yesterday, of which 10,000 bags were ordered by the Price Stabilization Committee. Stockpiling of foreign rice in Hong Kong has not been interrupted. For days still shipping to Shanghai in response to the market.</p>
<p>Price Stabilization Deadline</p>
<p>The fifth phase of cheap broken rice, started on the 20th of last month, is 20 days up to the 8th of this month. It was decided to follow the established method, with 20 days as a phase, so the fifth phase of price stabilization will end on that day. The sixth phase of price stabilization is awaiting the official decision of the committee.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Market Tight</p>
<p>The market situation at yesterday morning's rice shop tea party was still quite tight. Although the Price Evaluation Committee announced the implementation of new price limits, the buying and selling of foreign rice in various stalls seemed to be exceeding the price limits, and the "scalping" trend was quite rampant. If the entire rice market continues in this way, the future troubles will be difficult to resolve. It is heard that the market buying and selling prices are based on the daily gold trading prices. If gold rises, the opening price is higher, and if the gold price is small, the opening price is slightly lower.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Bank Deposits Transferred to the Interior to Increase Interest; Shanghai Banks Pay Interest Without Remittance; Credit Deposits Distribute Profits</h3>
<p>Shanghai's floating capital is a disaster, competing for opportunities. In addition to open trading, there are dark trading, and in addition to black markets, there are dark markets, resulting in daily changes in commodity prices and difficulties in people's livelihoods. The government authorities are extremely concerned about the situation in Shanghai. It is learned that the authorities have accepted expert advice and are planning to implement the following two points to encourage the transfer of floating capital to the interior: (1) The four banks of the China Farmer Bank, or other major banks, promote deposits and increase interest rates. Depositors specify the transfer to a certain place in the interior, but the interest is paid by the Shanghai bank without remittance. (2) A consortium organizes West-North-South industrial companies in Shanghai to specialize in credit deposits, with a weekly interest rate of 7%. If there is a surplus, the consortium and the depositors share it equally. Experts pointed out that the above methods are beneficial to the livelihood assets of Shanghai citizens and the future of national construction, so the authorities have decided to implement them.</p>
<h3>Three Shanghai Ships Arrive Safely at Songmen and Fuqing</h3>
<p>The German-owned Lulin Shipping Company's Gaodeng ship arrived at Songmen at 8:30 a.m. yesterday and has berthed to unload cargo. It is expected to return to Shanghai this afternoon. The Lihe Moufu ship also set sail on the morning of the 3rd. When it passed the Putuo waters, it anchored for several hours and arrived at Songmen at 11:00 a.m. yesterday. It can return to Shanghai tomorrow morning. Also, the German ship Haiyi has returned to Shanghai from Songmen with cargo and is still on the way. The company has also scheduled to reopen from Shanghai to Songmen on the afternoon of the 6th, and transfer to Wanqu, Qushan, Chuanshan, Xiushan, etc. The British ship Xin'anna arrived at Fuqing at 7:00 p.m. on the 3rd and is currently unloading cargo at the pier. It can return to Shanghai in a week.</p>
<h3>Industry After the Start of Autumn is Gradually Becoming Active; The Trend of Speculation Has Declined; Some Manufacturers Feel Distressed</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Industrial Section's August report, the trend of purchasing goods for speculation in this city since May has been suppressed. No such incidents were found last month. Most factories have suffered losses due to the delayed shipments of general speculative buyers, because the current sales price of these inventories is lower than the recent manufacturing price. According to yarn factory operators, the government's change in the commercial exchange rate on August 1 and the gradual decline in the exchange rate, coupled with the reduction in interest rates, may prevent the current situation from worsening. The work of several industries is relatively slack in the summer and awaits purchases after the autumn harvest. However, there are also many types of goods that can continue to be shipped and sold to the interior. Cigarette factories have returned to their original state of work. Factories that manufacture nails, needles, door locks, hinges, clock hands, fountain pens, zippers, etc. are busy. Hosiery and other clothing factories are able to maintain the situation of their respective products. Hand-woven fabrics for export are also very active. There are six silk factories in operation, only two of which have obtained fresh supplies. The rayon weaving industry is in a downturn. Of the 21 paint spraying factories, those whose work was in danger ceased operations last month. The total number of these factories that have ceased operations is 43. Another five have hired qualified engineers to be responsible for designing and correcting equipment. Due to factors such as reduced work and high living costs, industrial disputes still occur frequently. Last month, the Industrial Section explained a total of nine such disputes, including five due to reduced work, one due to requests for increased rice subsidies, and three due to requests for improved treatment. There were three strike incidents in the disputes, affecting 1,370 workers and four factories.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Military Supplies Seized in Xujiahui</h3>
<p>The Japanese military police and the "Municipal Police Department" seized a large number of military supplies in the Zhang Tongtai gluten workshop on Xuzhen Road in Xujiahui on the 22nd of last month. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. According to the investigation, the military supplies were left over from the former security team. The shop owner, Zhang Chunquan, has been arrested by the "Police Department," and Zhou Chengxiang, the former head of the security team there, has also been summoned for questioning.</p>

<h3>British Supreme Court Celebrates 75th Anniversary; Oldest Foreign Court in China; Judges Witness Shanghai's Great Development</h3>
<p>The English-language "Ta Mei Wan Bao" reported that the British Supreme Court for China, the oldest foreign court in China, is celebrating its 75th anniversary today (the 4th). In these 75 years, it has achieved outstanding success in protecting the vast commercial interests of the British in China. It is understood that the British Supreme Court for China was established by Sir Hope on September 4, 1865. At that time, China was still isolated from the world, Shanghai was just a village, and the houses along the Huangpu River were sparsely populated. Most of the remaining land was fields for planting cotton and grain, interspersed with small houses built by foreigners. The eight judges of the British Supreme Court for China have personally witnessed Shanghai's development from a small village to a large city in these 75 years. The most important decision of the court in its early days was that the Shanghai Municipal Council had legal status and the right of self-government. Today, the only foreign courts in China representing foreign countries are the British and American Supreme Courts. Sir Mosso, the British Supreme Court Judge, has 25 years of legal experience in China and has held this position since 1933.</p>

<h3>Unified Enrollment of Public Colleges and Universities This Year: More than 5,600 Students Admitted, Engineering is the Most Popular, Followed by Law and Commerce</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 4th) This year's unified enrollment of public colleges and universities was held simultaneously in 16 examination districts and 17 branches across the country. A total of 38 colleges and universities are enrolling. Except for the three examination districts of Luoyang, Taihe, and Shanghai, the registration numbers from all districts have been received, totaling 15,513 applicants. The actual number of examinees was 14,672. Currently, the results of each district have been reviewed, and a total of 5,627 new university students, 1,117 students in the university preparatory class, and 180 new students from schools that need to be recruited on their behalf have been admitted. All have been assigned to various colleges and universities for enrollment based on the candidates' aspirations, grades, and region, and with reference to the enrollment quota of each school. The list was posted in Chongqing by the Ministry on September 3. This year, the number of admissions based on candidates' aspirations is the largest for engineering, followed by law and commerce, then liberal arts and teachers' colleges, while science, agriculture, and medicine are relatively few. The admission standards are carefully formulated with reference to national needs and the level of universities in order to adapt to the quality and performance of this year's candidates. Because of the strict restrictions on equivalent qualifications, the level is more uniform. Last year, those who applied with secondary school graduation qualifications accounted for 75%, and those with equivalent qualifications accounted for 25%. This year, those applying with high school graduation qualifications account for only 6%. The quality of candidates should be better than last year. Last year, the ratio of applicants to admissions was four to one, and this year it is about three to one. Superficially, this year seems to be inferior, but in fact, the quality of this year's candidates is better, and the level is naturally more uniform. This year, the average score in each district increased by two points compared to last year, which can be seen from this. As for the students who have not been admitted, in addition to some who can be employed, various vocational schools, private universities, and military schools are currently recruiting. Students still have the opportunity to apply, so they will not lose their education, it is said.</p>

The imitations can all be confused with the real ones. All the methods of the various schools in the North and South Song Dynasties are good at and have long skills. He is truly an unparalleled talent in modern times, and the price is not high. I think there will be a grand occasion on the opening day.</p>

<h3>Two Japanese Ships' Passengers Thoroughly Searched: Qingdao Maru Found Large Sum in Dalian; Fengtian Maru Searched by Japanese Soldiers Upon Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Ta Mei Evening News," the Japanese-owned Dalian Steamship Company's Qingdao Maru, sailing south from Dalian and Qingdao, arrived in Shanghai eight days late yesterday (the 3rd). According to passengers arriving in Shanghai on the ship, the Qingdao Maru, after weighing anchor in Dalian, was ordered back by the port's Bureau of Life after approaching Qingdao. The next day, it returned to Dalian, where port police boarded and conducted a thorough search of the passengers. Many foreign passengers were also subjected to searches. It is believed that 10,000 Japanese yen was found in the luggage of one Chinese passenger, who was then arrested by the Dalian police. Furthermore, the Japanese ship Fengtian Maru arrived in Shanghai from Dalian and Qingdao at 9:20 PM last night (the 3rd). Two squads of Japanese soldiers boarded the ship, ordering all passengers to return to their cabins. They then searched the luggage one by one. Some passengers were also searched personally, lasting about an hour.</p>

<h3>Finance: US Dollar Nearing 50,000 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) posting rates, unchanged at first. At 10:45 AM, the second posting showed the British pound tightening by 1.125, at 3/8/3.375, while the US dollar weakened by 1.875, posting at 5 yuan. Other currencies like the Dutch Guilder, Luxembourg Franc, and Japanese Yen also generally weakened. As for the domestic market, the uncertainty of the situation in Vietnam favored bullish traders, leading to a shortage of sellers. In particular, aggressive buying by the Bank of Korea after the opening caused the market to steadily weaken. Speculators followed suit, driving prices higher. The US dollar was seen at 5.0937 yuan, approaching the 5 yuan mark. The British pound reached 3/8/3.4375 before speculators took some profits, slightly recovering its underlying strength. At the close, the British pound was at 3/8/3.453125, and the US dollar at 5.1875, tightening by 0.0625 and weakening by 0.03125 compared to the previous day respectively. The futures market followed the spot market. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>(HSBC postings showed further weakening)</p>
<p>In the early morning, London's big deals were up 0.062 yuan in the near term and 0.125 yuan in the long term. New York silver prices remained flat, and London gold remained stagnant. Exchange rates between the British pound and the US dollar remained unchanged, and also flat against Shanghai. The US dollar fell by 0.08 against Shanghai, with no market against the French Franc. The central government's posted rates for all currencies remained the same. Banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of 3/8/3.515625 for the British pound and 5.21875 for the US dollar, both unchanged from the previous day's closing. After the opening, the Bank of Korea aggressively bought, pushing the spot US dollar from 5.21875 to 5.1875, gradually tightening the market. At the same time, HSBC also posted 5.1875 for the spot US dollar, with strong demand. Soon, foreign banks were selling the spot US dollar to the Bank of Korea, causing it to weaken to 5.125. HSBC's initial posting remained unchanged, but the second posting weakened the British pound by 1.125 to 3/8/3.375, and suspended the US dollar at 5 yuan, tightening by 1.875. Other currencies such as the Dutch Guilder, Luxembourg Franc, and Japanese Yen generally weakened. Afterwards, Chinese speculators followed suit, resulting in a shortage of sellers and continuing price increases. September US dollars were traded at 5.1875 and October US dollars at 5.05, while the spot US dollar was seen at 5.09375. The British pound also reached 3/8/3.4375. Towards the afternoon close, the market became quieter, with fewer buyers and speculators taking profits, slightly strengthening the price. The British pound closed at 3/8/3.45315 and the US dollar at 5.1875. The following month's British pound was at 3/8/3.4375 and the US dollar at 5.15625, weakening by 0.0615 and tightening by only 0.03125 respectively, compared to yesterday's close.

<h3>Gold Market Swayed by Rumors, Wildly Fluctuating</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after soaring on the black market, spot gold fell again. Due to confusing news, trading was intense, with countless ups and downs. In the early morning, with continued optimism, the market jumped 60 yuan at the opening to 6350 yuan. Shortly after, a sharp weakening in foreign exchange triggered a large buying wave, especially with bullion houses adding to their long positions, pushing the price up to 6440 yuan. However, this was influenced by securities firms and retail investors taking profits at high prices. At the same time, negative rumors suddenly prevailed, leading to more sellers and pushing the price down to 6310 yuan. The market eventually closed at 6330 yuan, a 40 yuan increase from the previous day's settlement. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon. Off-exchange trading was initially weak but then recovered, with rumors of Japanese troops landing at the coastal defense, driving the price to around 6370-6380 yuan. Trading was quite active in the first half of the day, with about 3,000 taels changing hands. Gold shops eventually raised the price of jewelry by 10 yuan, while customs duties remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Rises by 40 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (10 taels) initially jumped 60 yuan at the opening to 6350 yuan due to tight exchange rates and continued firm sentiment, with all parties initially calling for buying. Subsequently, the price rose another 20 yuan due to continued strong buying, with bullion houses buying 20 taels for securities firms at 6370 yuan. Later, bullion houses and other parties sold off, and Yinyi also sold off, causing a temporary decline. Qiankuang also sold 30 taels of gold, falling to 6335 yuan. Afterwards, due to increased tightness in the exchange market, a certain bullion house added to its long positions, and another bullion house also bought over 1,000 taels. Soon, the buying frenzy pushed the price up by 105 yuan, with bullion houses buying 50 taels from jewelry stores at a new recent high of 6440 yuan. Later, some retail investors took profits at high prices. Shortly after, a certain securities firm with a large long position suddenly sold off, and the long position company of the bullion house also sold off, causing the market to suddenly reverse and fall to within 6400 yuan. At the same time, rumors of negative news from within the country spread in the market, leading to a gradual increase in selling pressure. The certain bullion house that had been aggressively buying initially also started to sell off, eventually reaching a low of 6310 yuan before the afternoon close. However, the market recovered slightly at the close, ending at 6330 yuan, still up 40 yuan from the previous day. Off-exchange trading was flat and weak after the close, with transactions at 6310 yuan. However, off-exchange trading recovered in the afternoon due to rumors of Japanese troops landing at the coastal defense, rising to 6370-6380 yuan. There was a total fluctuation of 130 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of spot gold at bullion houses was about a dozen yuan higher than the actual gold price, while the buying price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, with little trading activity.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Rises by 10 Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael at Yinlou was initially 640 yuan at Datonghang, but then rose by 10 yuan at 9:30 AM, another 10 yuan at 10:20 AM, and then fell slightly by 10 yuan at 11:30 AM. In the end, it rose by 10 yuan, with Datonghang revising the price to 650 yuan. The price at Xin Tonghang was the same, with the buying price reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>More Foreign Currencies Rise Than Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw spot gold rise sharply before slightly retreating, but ultimately still rising. The British and American gold bars finally rose by one yuan. Trading in British gold notes gradually decreased, with the market price stabilizing. The US dollar note once reached 19.36 yuan, but then suddenly fell to 19.1 yuan near noon due to rumors that Soong Tzu-wen was to be appointed Minister of Finance. In the afternoon, rumors of Japanese troops landing at the coastal defense caused it to rise again to 19.2 yuan, ultimately rising by 0.28 yuan from the previous day. The Hong Kong dollar note continued to rise along with the exchange rates between Hong Kong and Shanghai. The Singapore dollar note was slightly in demand, causing the market price to rise slightly. The Japanese yen note continued to decline, falling to 1.6 yuan in the evening market, down another 0.065 yuan from the previous day. The Korean won note was also oversupplied, falling to 1.17 yuan in the evening market.</p>
<h3>Bank of Issue Should Indicate Whether Fractional Notes are Genuine or Counterfeit</h3>
<p>Since this newspaper first reported the discovery of 5-cent counterfeit notes in the market, most stores have been paying attention. Today's newspaper reports that a reporter from Pingming News Agency gave a detailed explanation of the differences between genuine and counterfeit 5-cent notes, which is more convenient for those who receive and pay with fractional notes to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit notes. However, the first point raised by the agency: "The English at the end of the reverse side of a genuine note is (UNION PUBLISHERS&amp;PRINTERS, FED. INC. U.S.A.), while the counterfeit note is (UNIONPRINTING CO. U.S.A.)." This reporter compared it with a 1-cent auxiliary note and found that both types of English appear at the end of the reverse side of the 1-cent note. The former paper is smooth, while the latter paper is slightly rougher. The former color is deep and glossy, while the latter is light and dull. The former has English letters on both the left and right ends of the number, while the latter only has an English letter on the left side. However, the versions are very clear, fine, and precise, and the sizes are the same, making it impossible to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit notes. It is believed that 1-cent notes should not be counterfeited, perhaps due to batch printing. (I am attaching two types of fractional notes for the editor to review.)</p>
<p>The discovery of counterfeit fractional notes has attracted widespread attention in society. The responsible issuing bank should not turn a deaf ear and remain silent about whether they are genuine or counterfeit. Although the points raised by Pingming News Agency can distinguish between genuine and counterfeit notes, the above-mentioned 1-cent note seems to still be questionable. It is hoped that the bank will provide an accurate statement to know what to do. (Junmei)</p>

<h3>Grain Prices: Foreign Rice Soars Due to Zhao's Assessment, Unscrupulous Merchants Remain Unsubdued... Though Foreign Rice Arrives, Surge Continues, New Shipments Arrive Gradually... Transportation Relies Solely on Bicycles</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for foreign rice was relatively firm. Trading started actively, followed by customers from inland villages competing for purchases. In an instant, all prices reached parity. With the market lacking room for adjustment, many bullish traders were still planning to absorb large quantities, employing a strategy of deliberate suppression followed by advancement to confuse the market. Consequently, the situation became increasingly chaotic. Rumors suggested that closing prices, while ostensibly adhering to limits, were secretly circumventing them, with actual transactions exceeding official rates by one or two yuan. There were also reports of No. 1 Saigon parboiled rice being traded off-exchange at 63 or 64 yuan. Many parties had fueled the market with Vietnamese rumors since morning, and cargo owners became reluctant to sell at lower prices. The market was also enlivened by speculative activity from Shantou and other inland groups, showing a vigorous atmosphere. However, due to the continuation of price limits and a reduction of five cents on smaller bags, formal trading was largely limited to substituting inferior goods for superior ones. For example, original packages from the British-Chinese Company, with a limit price of 70 yuan, were only formally traded at 65 yuan, while the black market saw deals of 300 to 400 tons at 72 or 73 yuan. The total volume of foreign rice traded openly and secretly yesterday reached 13,000 to 14,000 bags, mostly acquired by hoarders.</p>
<p>Amidst this large-scale manipulation by rice merchants, significant shipments of foreign rice continued to arrive in Shanghai. The Wah Lun Shipping Company's Da Pu vessel arrived yesterday morning from Saigon, carrying 25,982 bags of foreign rice, and docked at the Hongxing Wharf in Pudong for unloading. (Ancestor)</p>
<p>Over 1,000 bags of domestic Japonica and glutinous rice arrived yesterday. Amidst this chaotic situation, both open and black market trading were reportedly extremely volatile. Cargo owners hoarded and demanded high prices, while customers blindly sought supplies, causing prices to surge by one or two yuan. Original packages mostly exceeded the 70 yuan mark. Specifically, common ordinary white Japonica rice from Changzhou was 74 yuan, exceptionally clear Japonica rice reached 76 yuan, Wuxi clear Japonica rice was 73 or 74 yuan, Changzhou Su Kun Japonica rice was 72 or 73 yuan, and lower grades were around 70 yuan. Green husk thin rice was 72 yuan, original packages of early rice from Nangang were 71.5 yuan, and husked rice was 68 yuan. As for glutinous rice, Jin Li special grade was 68 or 69 yuan, Dan cargo was 66 or 67 yuan, similar to Hong Kong glutinous rice.</p>
<p>New Japonica rice continued to arrive from Zhoupu, listed for the 35th time. However, supplies were limited as they were mainly transported by bicycle, amounting to only eight *dan*. The quality was better than the new Japonica rice from Zhoupu. It coincided with the soaring prices of other goods, the limited supply was insufficient to meet demand, and the price opened at 68 yuan. New Japonica rice from Zhoupu also sold well, opening at 67 or 68 yuan, a significant increase of one or two yuan. Although new pointed rice from Taicang continued to arrive, the inconvenient inland transportation meant that only small amounts could be transported by bicycle, making them sell quickly. Only twelve *dan* arrived, opening at 64 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Remains Tight, Fuxin and Fufeng Supply Only Half</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the market for spot flour continued to be tight. Following Fufeng Mill's reduction in supply by half, Fuxin Mill also reduced its supply. While factory prices remained unchanged, returned goods were sold at 15.20 yuan. At the same time, Sanxin Mill also restricted the supply of spot flour. Although the price was only 14.50 yuan, there was a shortage of goods for purchase. Therefore, hoarding of Phoenix brand flour in October was quite active, with the price rising from 15.20 yuan to 15.28 yuan, and 5,000 to 6,000 bags were traded. Foreign flour and inland firm varieties did not open.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's trading remained unremarkable. Due to the poor quality of raw materials, Chinese mills not only reduced supply but also tried to purchase wheat as much as possible. However, it was difficult to bring wheat into the concession, so even with price increases, there was no significant amount available. Yesterday, 400 to 500 bags of wheat were collected from Jiading Luodian, with the highest price at 25 yuan, and medium grades at 24.50 to 24 yuan. Japanese mills continued to be stringent in their purchases, mostly directly allocating goods, and the price was still only around 21 yuan. In reality, these were all prices for delivery to the mills, with no formal market.</p>
<h3>Bonds: Fluctuations in Domestic Debt, Conflicting Rumors</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter market for bonds initially saw a decline of 30 to 50 cents due to excessive short selling, but then rebounded. In the afternoon, there was a sudden surge, with Class C bonds exceeding 4 yuan and Class A bonds surpassing 3 yuan, trending upward. The market was rife with rumors, both positive and negative. Some said that Song Ziwen had obtained a loan of 100 million US dollars from the United States, while others said that Ambassador Cole's visit to Chongqing was related to peace talks. Others said that there were problems with the French Concession, or that the situation in Haiphong was becoming tense. The rumors were unreliable, but with extremely loose credit, the bond market was not easily underestimated. During yesterday's market activity, the morning started weak but then gained momentum. Class C bonds reached a high of 54.10 yuan, and other types also reached new highs. The largest buyers were Companies 16 and Tong Kang. Lianhe, Dahua, Shuntai, Xiehe and Yuan all had substantial purchases. Hongda and Jiufeng had considerable sales. Tiansheng, Xinchang, Lianyi, and Dayuan also had sales. As a result, Class A and C were slightly lower, Class D and E continued to rise, and Class B was flat. The total transaction volume was estimated to be over 1.5 million yuan. A summary table is provided below:</p>
<p>Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Change from Previous Day</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>Class A National Bonds | 63.10 | 62.70 | 62.90 | Down 0.05</p>
<p>Class B National Bonds | 57.425 | 57.00 | 57.20 | Flat</p>
<p>Class C National Bonds | 54.10 | 51.35 | 53.75 | Down 0.05</p>
<p>Class D National Bonds | 52.80 | 52.70 | 52.80 | Up 0.20</p>
<p>Class E National Bonds | 53.85 | 53.25 | 53.60 | Up 0.10</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 45 shares of Zhonghua Book Company were traded at a price of 30.01 yuan per share.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market fluctuated. The opening trend was weak, but then rose slightly. However, due to excessive profit-taking, firm prices could not be maintained for long, and the closing trend softened again. Rubber stocks were again subject to selling pressure, but prices remained relatively good.</p>
<p>London, 3rd (Tuesday) Dispatch: Today, company stock quotations remained flat. Only HSBC shares continued to improve, with UK-registered shares rising another £3 to £67, and Hong Kong-registered shares also rising £2 to £71. Exchange rates were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Fluctuates</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise, but with fluctuations changing several times a day, it is conceivable that traders are also uncertain. In fact, the rise in gold prices and the continued contraction of foreign exchange have spurred buying, but actual business is still affected by blockades on various routes, making large-scale development difficult. Therefore, when the rise is severe, those who profit will sell off, and the market will loosen. When foreign exchange tightens, buyers will follow. Judging from this situation, the current market has completely become speculative.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened calmly in the morning, with 20-count Double Horse yarn priced at 1,025 yuan. It soon fell to 1,017 yuan. Unexpectedly, the foreign exchange market opened tighter and gold prices soared, suddenly exciting people and causing buying to surge to 1,038, 1,039, and 1,040 yuan. A small number of deals were made. Upon hearing that foreign exchange had eased, the price quickly fell to 1,030 yuan. After closing, it was impossible to sell at 1,030 yuan. According to half-day transaction statistics, 10,945 bales were traded, with 20-count Double Horse yarn rising by 8 yuan. Today, 2,180 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount of yarn purchased by various groups is listed below:</p>
<p>Same Trade: 2,680 Bales | Hong Kong: 255</p>
<p>Ningbo: 10 Bales | Total: 2,945 Bales</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants Purchase New Cotton, US and Indian Cotton Markets Active</h3>
<p>The spot cotton trade was weaker than yesterday, but market sentiment remained tight. Factory demand has not yet materialized, but it is much easier for Japanese merchants to obtain and use removal permits when purchasing new cotton.</p>
<p>White Rock: 100.00 Shipped by Shunfeng Jin: 200 Pieces</p>
<p>General Package: 186.00 Also: 92 Bales</p>
<p>Also: 183.00 Also: 88 Bales</p>

<p>Also: 168.00 Shipped by Yuanxingde: 1,213 Bales</p>
<p>Fire Machine: 151.5</p>
<p>According to other news, the international cotton market in New York was quite active, and the spot market was also very lively. At the same time, due to the good prices of stocks on Wall Street, the cotton market was very firm. As a result, closing prices rose by seven or eight points compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market initially rose yesterday due to some short covering, and then there were widespread rumors that the British government had ordered 5,831,700 burlap sacks in India to be filled with sand for air defense purposes, causing the cotton market to soar. As a result, including forecasts, the market rose by a massive 14 rupees compared to yesterday.</p>
<p>International cotton trading in Shanghai has been quite lively recently. However, due to the limited inventory in the market, prices are quite high, and traders are unwilling to show samples, because everyone knows the difficulty of ordering and transporting international cotton. Under these circumstances, cotton prices will rise day by day.</p>
<h3>Coal: Large Quantities of Vietnamese Coal En Route, Tongdeli Coal Arrives with Over 6,000 Tons</h3>
<p>Amidst the blockade of Vietnam, white coal from there is en route in large quantities and will arrive successively. Yesterday, it was reported that a certain firm had just received 6,250 tons of Tongdeli white coal, which was being unloaded at the dock, causing a stir in the soaring market, slightly calming the market and reassuring people. The black market is said to be declining.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: New Western Sea Cucumber Arrives, First Batch Sold</h3>
<p>A new batch of Western red jade sea cucumber has arrived, with a full range of grades. The first batch has already been sold, as detailed below. The prices are as follows: Luzon-produced jade: 359 to 361 yuan; No. 1: 337 to 343 yuan; No. 2: 333 to 339 yuan; No. 3: 293 to 317 yuan; No. 4: 273 to 295 yuan; Longya selected strips jade: 500 yuan; Produced jade: 480 yuan; No. 1: 470 yuan; No. 2: 457 yuan; No. 3: 440 yuan; Medium jade: 402 yuan; Makassar selected strips: 470 to 486 yuan; No. 1: 444 to 417 to 411 yuan; No. 2: 373 to 404 to 430 yuan; No. 3: 356 to 379 to 402 yuan; No. 4: 333 to 341 to 378 yuan; No. 5: 328 to 338 to 357 yuan; Small jade: 227 to 277 to 280 yuan; Xianda Port produced jade: 465 yuan; No. 1: 436 yuan; Large No. 2: 416 yuan; No. 2: 398 yuan; No. 3: 379 yuan; No. 4: 369 yuan. In total, current prices are higher than the previous market, with the top three grades of jade sea cucumber increasing by nearly 100 yuan, and the next grades increasing by about 20 to 50 yuan, while the increase in red sea cucumber is only slightly noticeable.</p>

<h3>Strict Prohibition of Banquet Raids</h3>
<p>After the Jiangnan Provincial Examination, the practice of raiding banquets has been prevalent for a long time. The reason for this is that when rural areas hired servants for the examinations, in addition to providing supplies, all the equipment should be taken back by those who were responsible. However, servants and followers often took the opportunity to seize items, so it was necessary to send more staff to wait nearby. As soon as the banquet was over, they would immediately collect the items. At this time, with many people and hands, the servants still inevitably seized items by force, hence the name "banquet raid." Initially, they were afraid of official investigation, but as the excuses for raiding became more and more rampant, the practice has been perpetuated. Up to now, even before the banquet guests have risen, seven or eight hands, with bared teeth and brandished claws, already surround the area, waiting to strike. As soon as the diners stand up, fingers reach down to grab items from the table, overturning soup and clanging bowls and cups. In a very short time, the table is completely empty, even before the officials have stood firmly. It is not known that the Deer Cry Banquet is the court's intention to honor the worthy, and the ceremony is grand and important. Therefore, when the banquet was held on the 30th of last month, Military Commissioner Shen deeply hated this long-standing custom and issued a strict prohibition in advance, stating that anyone who continued to follow the old ways and raided the banquet would be punished according to military law. The banquet was moved to the examination hall, and orders were given to the magistrates of the upper and lower Jiang counties to guard the gates, and no unauthorized persons were allowed to enter. Therefore, on that day, there were a total of eight scholars attending the banquet, and all the rituals were carried out in an orderly and measured manner, unlike the perfunctory manner of previous examinations.</p>

<h3>Can't Live Anymore</h3>
<p>-- Wan Jiachun</p>
<p>Because I am quite busy with life, I have no chance for leisurely strolls. However, I leave early and return late every day, and due to my job, I often run around on the streets (or rather, walk quickly). Although my feet are tired, I treat it as a stroll, so my steps become lighter.</p>
<p>I originally treated all walking as a stroll. As I walked, I saw six corpses wrapped in straw mats in a row, which greatly diminished my interest in strolling. But I did not reduce my courage to face reality: continuing to slip past my feet was a middle-aged woman. She sat on the ground, holding a child in her arms, with another lying beside her, crying, "Mom: I want to eat sesame cake!" The woman only stared blankly at the four words "Can't live anymore" written in chalk on the pavement.</p>
<p>This hasty stroll had already reached the end of Route Père Robert. Many children and passersby raised their heads to look at a window on the third floor. I also stopped to watch; I saw a foreigner standing by the window, pinching two fingers and throwing golden coins (probably coins for "slot machines") onto the road. The children scrambled to grab them, and the more they scrambled, the more he threw. Seeing a car pass by, he threw out even larger batches. I realized that this building was the clubhouse of some foreign soldiers, and that foreigners, in addition to drinking, dancing, and making merry, were now taking the lives of poor Chinese children to amuse themselves!</p>
<p>Walking on the crowded streets, I often encountered people distributing drug advertisements. As anyone walked past them, leaflets would be handed from their fingers, rustling softly, very pleasant to hear. If one was greedy for small gains and wanted to take an advertisement paper back to start a coal stove, and accepted it, then they would ask you to buy a package of drugs. At this time, they would surround you, and you would have to buy it. The drugs you bought were more expensive than in pharmacies. These rustling sounds also solved the livelihood of a small number of people.</p>
<p>The sun was setting in the west, and I was about to go home. As I "strolled" to Guizhou Road, a pair of delicate jade hands suddenly encircled my neck, accompanied by a melodious voice: "Spend three dimes and go sit and relax for a while!" She did not specify where to "sit" with three dimes, but I was determined not to go. So I said: I haven't had dinner yet, let's go sit in a while! "No, no, you won't come later." But I gently took her by surprise and slipped into a store. ... After talking with the boss for a while, it suddenly started raining. The "wild chickens" on the street all turned into drowned chickens. I thought of what had just happened and asked the boss: "They probably don't get many customers, right?" The boss replied: "No! They always get one or two every day." I also asked, "Each customer only spends two or three dimes, right!" He answered: "Hmph! At least seven or eight dollars, maybe they'll "go white and cold" if they have money in their pocket." "Uh!" - But what do they get from selling their flesh, these poor creatures!</p>

<h3>The Headmistress</h3>
<p>-- Pei Ling</p>
<p>There is a small school in our alley, the headmaster of which died early, and now the headmistress continues.</p>
<p>This headmistress, according to our landlady, is "uneducated." I'm afraid even she herself can't explain what this means. But in fact, her four sons all graduated from that small school, and the youngest, Mao Mao, is now in the third grade, so they have all received the "educational influence" of the headmistress. The so-called "uneducated" probably refers to not having property.</p>
<p>She certainly doesn't have much property, even if she has a small school, it is just an alley school. The courtyard is used as a playground, and the box room is used as the administrative office. The house is small, but she tries hard to attract business: so that six students share one table. Recently, she added a kindergarten in the kitchen, so "although the sparrow is small," it is "fully equipped." Speaking of which, the headmistress should be given the most credit.</p>
<p>Because we have a dozen children studying there, she considers them her "big customers," so during the summer vacation, she often comes to play, and when enough people gather, they play mahjong at the landlord's house. After eight rounds, the headmistress pushed the tiles: "How about this? Headmistress Xu, you won 18,000, consider it Mao Feng's tuition!"</p>
<p>"Okay, okay." Headmistress Xu is also happy to have one less expense.</p>
<p>After mahjong, they start chatting, and the headmistress asks:</p>
<p>"What was drawn in the lottery last night?"</p>
<p>"Hanyun;" Headmistress Wang was regretting forgetting to bet.</p>
<p>"Oh; really Hanyun? I dreamed of a cow the night before, and I was born in the year of the ox, why didn't I bet on Hanyun?" The headmistress recalled her dream the night before. She thought, if she had won, she could have set up a scholarship!"</p>
<p>As I put down my pen, the headmistress called out again:</p>
<p>"Headmistress Wang, how about four rounds?"</p>
<p>Note: "Hanyun" is one of the thirty-six doors of the flower society, said to be "ox spirit"</p>
<p>Huo Sang Detective Story</p>
<h3>The Dancer's Fate</h3>
<p>-- Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Six Dangerous Experiences</p>
<p>Huo Sang continued: "I increased the speed of the car, chased it to within ten yards of the car in front, and then followed the speed ahead, keeping a distance. The car passed Guizhou Road, Xizang Road, and then went west all the way to Xuhui Road, without stopping along the way. Near the end of Xuhui Road, it suddenly turned around. Fortunately, I was quick-eyed and quickly turned into a side road, avoiding his line of sight. Guess where he stopped the car after he drove back east?"</p>
<p>I replied, "But did he still return to the Astor House Hotel?"</p>
<p>Huo Sang glanced at me suddenly and nodded. "That's right, Bao Lang, your reasoning ability is indeed good. He still lives in the Astor House."</p>
<p>"Then, do you already know his room number?"</p>
<p>Huo Sang frowned suddenly and sighed slightly. "No, that's what I call the failure point. Because his car stopped at the west side entrance of the Astor House, he got out of the car and walked into the Astor House. Of course, I followed. At that time, I had already temporarily disguised myself, and my coat was also in the car. When he walked into the western elevator hall, I could have caught up to enter. But because I was too careful, I was afraid of being seen through, so I didn't dare to take the same elevator with him. I had no choice but to wait in front of the phone room. When the elevator came back down, I rushed in to ask the driver. Although the driver had a slight impression of the previous guest, he was not very clear. He said that the man with the beard seemed to have gotten off the elevator on the fifth floor. I believe that this person really lives on the fifth floor, or at least is in the Astor House. So I plan to come back and discuss it with Jin Shou, and then go to find out his real room number."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou made a suspicious sound: "He wouldn't go up from one elevator and down from another, using a snake's sloughing method to sell you out, would he?"</p>
<p>Huo Sang shook his head and said, "No, I was very careful when I followed him in the car and never aroused his suspicion. Even if he saw me and wanted to sell me out, he could have found other opportunities when the car was circling around. Why return to the Astor House? You always know that criminals often abide by the saying: "The scene of the crime is the best hiding place." He must think this location is very safe."</p>
<p>"Do you believe he won't move away again?"</p>
<p>"No, he believes that I have been shot and does not know that I have followed him. Moreover, when I left the hotel, the 80844 car also drove away. I think he may not leave the hotel for a while." (97)</p>

<h3>Changed</h3>
<p>-- Fengzi</p>
<p>Friend, I can call you friend now, because you are right, we have indeed "changed." Although it has only been three short years, I have deeply experienced the taste of life. In this great city's melting pot, I see the seeds of evil flourishing in every dark corner, I hear the oppressed people groaning under the low pressure. At the same time, as I gradually see through the bottom of this beautiful city, I also see the shocking flames of war of the invaders. The continuous sound of gunfire! It still seems to be echoing in my ears. Friend, if at this time, I no longer "change"! Could I still be considered a "Chinese youth"?</p>
<p>The past is like a terrible nightmare, and I have thrown it away without any nostalgia. Now, I can no longer silently endure: this reality made of iron and blood has taught me how to resist. Friend, my "change" is by no means a miracle, just like your "change."</p>
<p>"Change," this blessable "change"! It has not only "changed" our two weak youths into such tough ones, it has not only "changed" many other youths into the vanguards of the country and the pillars of society, but also will cause more people to "change" in the future. Yes, in this great era, we should "change" from a parasite into a fierce tiger, we should "change" from a piece of waste into a boulder. Friend, even our country is gradually "changing" from weak to strong! So, let us be pioneers of "change"!</p>

<h3>The Wasting of Life</h3>
<p>— Zhou Wu</p>
<p>I took some time to visit an old classmate who has already entered the workforce, asking what he does for amusement in his free time. He shook his head, shrugged his shoulders, and said, "Nothing much! Sitting, sleeping, going out to play when I feel like it."</p>
<p>I was momentarily speechless, truly feeling sorry for such a young man. But the most regrettable thing is that in this era, countless young people are wasting precious time just like my friend, which is truly the wasting of life!</p>
<p>Many young people, after entering the workforce, consider their job duties as something they ought to do, while they squander and fritter away their free time; they think of this as the "rest" they deserve after work. They may all be dreaming of a great future, hoping for significant career development, but their actions contradict their aspirations.</p>
<p>After entering the workforce, one should certainly work extraordinarily hard and do one's best in their duties, but even so, at best, one is merely a capable and diligent clerk. If one hopes for development and promotion, one should use one's spare time outside of office hours to improve and enrich oneself. Adequate rest after work is necessary, but the remaining time should be well-utilized to achieve one's aspirations. Simply "sitting," "sleeping," and "playing" when one is free—isn't this just gradually wasting one's precious life?</p>
<p>I remember a famous saying: "We often curse the brevity of life, but our actions are as if life is endless!"</p>
<p>And perhaps those young people who are wasting their lives each have lofty ambitions, but they think of heading east while walking west. I deeply hope they can awaken and stop being wasters of life.</p>

<h3>Tokyo Dancers Change Profession to Tailors</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>The entertainment industry in Tokyo has been very depressed since the "Sino-Japanese War." Recently, the "anti-entertainment movement" has intensified, with all entertainment businesses, such as movies, horse racing, pachinko, and even reading pornographic movie magazines, being restricted. Furthermore, all dance halls are scheduled to close on October 1st. The general dance performers suddenly feel the panic of unemployment.</p>
<p>Investigations reveal that the dance halls in Tokyo have undergone several eliminations over the years, and only eight remain: "Teito," "Kyobashi," "Florida," "Union," "Izumibashi," "Nichibei," "Kowa," and "Ginza," employing 360 dancers and 109 musicians. Their situation was already not good, merely enough to make a living. Many of them intended to follow the example of their predecessors and seek alternative routes in China, but thinking that the better positions have already been taken, they have hesitated to act.</p>
<p>However, according to a manager of a Ginza dance hall, the future of Tokyo dancers is not entirely pessimistic. Some of them are taking precautions and have already learned sewing techniques, and will soon change their profession to tailoring; others plan to work as hostesses in bars to become skilled. As for the unemployed musicians, because jazz music will also be strictly prohibited, it will not be easy for them to find suitable outlets.</p>
<h3>Wu Suqiu Comes to Shanghai to Perform Again</h3>
<p>— Plum Blossom Hall Master</p>
<p>Wu Suqiu and her troupe, hired by the Gengxin Stage, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning aboard the Shengjing liner. Suqiu has brought more than twenty supporting actors this time. Brief biographies of each member are listed below:</p>
<p>Chi Shigong: Plays male roles. He is the eldest grandson of the old actor Chi Zijun. A graduate of the "Shi" class of the Fuliancheng Opera School, he is talented and young. When I went to Beijing last autumn, I watched his plays several times and considered him a promising talent. However, due to the weather at that time, his foundation was insufficient, so his pronunciation was not yet perfect. At the beginning of spring, I received a letter from my friend Ha Shaohuang from Beijing, stating that Shigong's voice had gradually developed since entering spring, possessing high, wide, and low tones. After performing various plays such as "Silang Visits His Mother," "Empty City Stratagem," "Catching and Releasing Cao," and "Zhu Lian Zhai," the audience unanimously praised him, and there were many articles of praise in the newspapers. Mr. Ha is skilled at discussing plays, so what he says is credible.</p>
<p>Chuan Dewei: A graduate of the first class of the Chinese Opera School, specializing in martial arts roles. He has profound skills and extensive repertoire, with a standard appearance and bearing. After graduating, he has performed in various troupes, assisting Wu Suqiu the most often. I have watched his plays "Changban Slope" and "Evil Tiger Village." His elaborate and simple martial arts performances were satisfactory. His talent can be compared with Yang Shengchun.</p>
<p>Li Debin: Plays young male roles, also a graduate of the Opera School. He is excellent in civil plays and has a foundation in martial arts. Plays such as "Exploring the Village," "Zhenzhou," "Yaguan Tower," and "Linjiang Meeting" are particularly wonderful. He came south with Xin Yanqiu last time, and the audience unanimously praised him, saying that among the rising young male actors, Debin is the only one who is proficient in both civil and martial arts. This statement is certainly not exaggerated. My friend Yu Zhenfei also said that Debin's martial arts young male plays are currently considered the best in the Liyuan world.</p>
<p>Guan Dexian: Also a graduate of the first class of the Opera School, specializing in the bearded male roles. He has a wide repertoire and beautiful talent. After graduating, he ended up as a supporting actor, which is a pity. I have seen many of Dexian's plays, with "Chunxiang's Uproar at School" as Chen Zuiliang, "Silang Visits His Mother" as Yang Yanzhao, "Zhu Lian Zhai" as Cheng Jingsi, and "Yu Tang Chun" as Liu Bingyi being the most satisfying. He has worked with Wu Suqiu for the longest time and is particularly familiar with her small plays. Suqiu's bringing him along this time is a wise decision.</p>
<p>Jia Duocai: A master of comic female roles, especially skilled at playing old women. This person has come to Shanghai several times, and the people of Shanghai are familiar with him. The female lead Wang Xiuwen is a rising talent, but I have not seen her in person. In addition, there is also a supporting male role, Hong Deyou, who also graduated from the Opera School. The play "Jinsha Beach" is Deyou's masterpiece.</p>
<h3>Zhou Xinfang's Condition</h3>
<p>According to Wu Xingzai, the owner of the Carlton Hotel, speaking to a reporter from the Haixing News Agency: President Zhou Xinfang of the Yifeng Society has not improved, even if he recovers within a few days, he will still need a considerable period of rest. To maintain the troupe's livelihood, they may invite Gao Baisui and Wang Xichun to take the lead and perform first. As for Zhang Yipeng substituting for Xinfang, it is probably impossible.</p>
<h3>The Sale of the Great Shanghai Theater is Completed</h3>
<p>Confirmed news: It has been said for some time that the Great Shanghai Theater, directly under the Rongrong Company, would be sold. After two months of deliberation, it has become a reality. The buyer is the Xingyi Company. The price is 510,000 national currency. A deposit of 10% has been paid today, and the transfer will take place in one month. The owner of Xingyi is Yan Chuntang. From now on, the public screenings of Yihua's new films will no longer suffer from being squeezed out. The Great Shanghai's magnificent architecture is second to none among the five national film first-run theaters.</p>
<h3>About "The Female Emperor"</h3>
<p>— Yongzi</p>
<p>Yihua's new film "The Female Emperor" can be considered one of the major films of the year. It is also the first film for Nan Guo Film Queen Li Qinian after coming to Shanghai. There is no doubt that it will be a great success. "The Female Emperor" is not an ordinary film. The story tells a historical fact during the Five Barbarian Invasions of China. It is based on historical research and is not the usual unofficial history. The Yihua Propaganda Department distributed copies of the story of "The Female Emperor" to the press and cultural circles at home and abroad yesterday, showing how serious Yihua is about producing "The Female Emperor."</p>
<p>After a month of production, the film will be completed in five or six days. Yihua also plans to hire several experts to conduct a rigorous review and will pay special attention to editing. "The Female Emperor" will be a miracle in the art world and will leave a glorious page in the history of Chinese cinema.</p>

<h3>Louise Rainer</h3>
<p>— Shawi</p>
<p>Louise Rainer, the actress who laid the foundation for her fame with "The Great Ziegfeld," has won several "Oscar" awards and has hundreds of thousands of fans. She is a very popular movie star. Since her "The Great Waltz," "The Good Earth," and "The Toy Wife" met us, news about her seems to have been very quiet. Until recently, I heard that a new film had arrived in Shanghai, tentatively translated as "The Parisian Virgin."</p>
<p>It is said that Louise's background is not very good. Before she became famous, she often worried about having enough to eat, so when she played those poor girls in the movies, she was more realistic than others.</p>
<p>And because she comes from a poor background, she is very sympathetic to the suffering of poor people and often helps them with what she can afford.</p>
<p>For this reason, some people say that she is a Communist, and some even say that she is a Communist, so she often plays ordinary people in her films. If that is really the case, it is very wrong. Aren't the roles that Louise plays assigned to her by the film company?</p>
<p>She stepped onto the stage at the age of sixteen. At first, she didn't want to be on the screen until she saw a famous film starring Helen Hayes, and became interested in it, and signed a contract with MGM. When she first arrived in Hollywood (Louise was originally Austrian), her English was not very good, so she hired a teacher there to make her English fluent before appearing on the screen.</p>
<p>She is indeed a very good actor among the stars of Hollywood. She once said, "To be an actor, his or her skin must be as thick as rubber," which can express her past inner pain and can also be said to be her secret to success. As for her award-winning works, they are "The Great Ziegfeld" and "The Good Earth."</p>
