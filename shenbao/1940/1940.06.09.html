<h3 id="c7">回敎國集團與歐戰前途 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>義大利參戰之謎，現時猶　作　後揭曉、而地中海形勢之極度緊張，則爲有目共覩之形態。雖美總統及羅馬敎皇皆曾盡最大之努力，謀限制戰禍之擴大，使勿蔓延於歐洲東南半壁；然爲主要角色之英法義三國執政者，彼此之間，仍極隔膜，外交上種種表示與動態，悉爲軍事上之積極準備所掩蔽。一日義大利果躍入戰爭漩渦，助德以攻英法，則歐洲戰事，勢將擴大在東西兩　戰塲上進行；西方以德國與英法爲主角，以爭大陸之霸權，東方　將以義大利與英法爲主角，以爭對於巴爾幹·東地中海·西亞·　菲之控制。西亞北菲、世所謂爲回敎國集團者也，其地扼歐亞之交通，爲用兵所必爭，當此戰雲瀰漫之時，愈益增加其重要性。然則此諸國者，其對於國際大局之關係果如何，其當前之立塲與動態又何如，誠甚値吾人一加解剖也。</p>
<p>第一，就交通言，蘇彝士運河乃地中海東方之門戶，而亞丁，又紅海東方之門戶也。英國欲取給其東方屬土（印度·馬來·澳洲·新西蘭諸地）之資源，必先謀鞏固地中海紅海之交通；然義大利與其東菲殖民地之聯繫，亦惟蘇彝士紅海是賴。兩大難容，此英義所由衝突之一根本原因也。第二，就經濟言，回敎國集團爲羊毛·棉花·烟草·家畜·及銅·鉛·錫·錳·　·鉀·煤炭等之出產地，無論英法或德義，皆有所求於此。而尤重要者，則西亞所產石油，殆爲英法生命錢之所寄託。計一九三八年英國輸入石油總額中，其百分之二十五，來自伊期（即波斯）伊拉克兩國，同年法國輸入石油總額中，則來自伊期伊拉克者，竟達百分之四十一；歐戰爆發以來，此數當更有增加。第三，回敎國集團在交通及經濟上之重要旣如此，則其軍事上之重要，自不難想見，蓋軍事之與交通經濟，固息息相通者也。况埃及之亞力山大里亞港及寨特港，巴勒斯丁之海發港，敍利亞之貝魯特港，皆爲英法海軍之主要根據地；而埃及之開羅，外的但之亞門，伊拉克之報達，敍利亞之大馬色，則又英法空軍結集之所。故就軍事言，西亞北菲之地，不啻爲英法兩大殖民帝國之肺腑。義大利而果參加歐戰者，勢必進攻此一區域；德國而果謀澈底打擊英法者。勢亦必求通過巴爾幹半島以控制此一區域。然則歐戰範圍而不免於擴大，則近東中東之地，將不免爲鏖戰之塲，劇爭之域，蓋可知矣。</p>
<p>溯自第一次歐戰結束以還，回敎國集團之地，幾全入英法勢力範圍之中，埃及爲英之附庸，巴勒斯丁，伊拉克爲英之代管地，敍利亞則爲法之代管地；他如伊則，阿富汗。阿刺伯等地，英國勢力，亦頗深入。英法對待此一方面之殖民地代管地之政策，雖亦頗可訾議，然大體不失爲開明，如伊拉克埃及之相繼於一九三二及一九三六年獲得英人贊助，完成其獨立體態，其明證也。近年以來，德義兩國，利用回敎民族之民族思想，多方煽動反英反法風潮，相當收效；巴勒斯丁·敍利亞之亂事，每發覺有法西斯國家之「第五縱隊活動於其間。但自義大利實行侵略阿比西尼亞與阿爾巴尼亞，及德國武力併吞奧捷諸邦後，近東回敎諸國，對於德義不但盡失其信念，抑且惟恐侵略之鋒，將更東向而擴展；反應所及，爰於亟謀自保之餘，促成對英法關係之長足進步。一九三七年，土耳其·伊朗·伊拉克·阿富汗四國，締結互小侵犯條的於前；旣而土耳其又與伊朗訂立相互援助之協定；最近且盛傳埃及伊拉克兩國，亦將加入此項協定。此回敎國集團之謀自保也。埃及伊拉克。本與英爲同盟國，故去年九月英法對德宣戰後，埃及伊拉克立即隨之對德斷絕國交；十月十九日，土耳其亦與英法訂立互助公約。於是英法與回敎國集團之聯繫，遂更臻緊密堅韌之境。由此推測，即使義大利斷然加入歐戰，聯合德國以東侵，殆亦不足以動搖央法在西亞北菲之優勢；而回敎集團諸邦，殆將以自助者助英法。將米戰事結束，重造和平，則諸邦之地位，當更蒸蒸日上。至於蘇聯，在地理上與回敎國集團相毘連，然蘇聯之　，在確守中立，在維持弱小鄰邦之現狀以爲之緩衝，其不王與德義沆瀣一氣以謀諸回敎國，是可想見者也。</p>

<p>巴黎　總司令部今晨發表戰報稱、敵軍戰車隊昨夜在拉勃萊爾河上游續有進展、其先頭部隊業已到達福爾奇萊索鎮近郊（該鎭在魯盎城東北面四十公里）前綫、其餘各處並無變動云、（八日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>巴黎　此間軍界人士頃談稱、自沿海至「夫人大道」一綫戰事、現正賡續進行、情况甚爲激烈、我軍當局對於戰局前途、極有把握、並因敵軍正分兩路、一在索美河西面拉勃萊爾河沿岸、一在亞勒脫河東面埃納河沿岸、向我軍兩翼進攻、爰將中路亞眠·貝金納·哈姆各處陣地向後撤退、藉以拉直陣綫、此外敵方戰車一隊雖於昨日侵入我軍防禦工事、但初未突破我方陣地、且孤掌難嗚、正由我軍加以肅淸、我軍現仍扼守全錢各據點、勿任敵軍步兵隨戰車隊衝入云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　據最後消息、前綫情形、大略如次、（一）自沿海勒脫萊波港起、至埃納河沿岸蒲爾埃戈曼鎭爲止、（按沃易斯河與埃納河間運河、即在該鎭與埃納河合流）戰事正在激烈進行中、蒲爾埃戈曼鎮乃前綫最東一點、（二）德軍在勒德爾與阿蒂尼兩地間、尙未向埃納河沿岸我軍陣地進攻、僅由砲隊開砲轟擊、（三）昨日敵軍曾謀在索亞松城東面、强渡埃納河、經鏖戰之後、卒被我軍擊退、未克如願以償、截至今晨爲止、我軍在索亞松城北面、仍復扼守埃納河北岸、而埃納河與沃易斯河間之林邱地帶、則於今日彿曉起、重復發生激戰、（四）沃易斯河兩岸、尤其是在烏爾斯岡森林與加爾邦鎭附近、（該鎭在沃易斯河南岸、與諾亞伊洪鎭隔河對峙）、亦正發生戰事、（五）沃易斯河與拉勃萊爾河中間戰綫、自哈姆城南面十公里乃至十二公里地方起、至拉勃萊爾河止、有時戰事蔓延及於此綫南面、即如拉勃萊河一帶、德軍戰車一隊、業已侵入我軍陣地、而在南面與西南面深入二十乃至二十五公里之遙、但此一戰車隊、因無步兵之接應、故未能久佔所得之地云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>— 叔棣</p>
<p>（三）土耳其的態度</p>
<p>（九月十七日於倫敦）</p>
<p>在羅馬尼亞宜佈「中立」後，英法方面的失望是不難想像的。因而，盛傳一時的法軍由黑海登岸，通過羅馬尼亞應援波蘭的計劃，也就完全失法了施行的可能。</p>
<p>其次值得注意的國家，是與英法有着同盟關係的土耳其。土耳其在德波戰發生時，及英法對德宜戰前夜，牠與英法之間的關係，大概相當於蘇德互不侵犯協定簽定前的英波間的關係，是同盟，然而沒有進一步的軍事默契，不過，在這兩個同盟彼此之間，却有唯一的一點不同，即是，英波同盟是廣活無條件的，英土同盟呢，却在地域上，僅限於巴爾幹，近東和埃及，而且有着一個非常重要的默契，作爲先決條件——因爲英土上次締盟，是在蘇聯諒解下，而同時，在英蘇即將合作的預知下，結定了的；所以先決條件是，在萬一英蘇敵對的塲合下，或蘇聯表示異議的塲合下，這一同盟不能生效。</p>
<p>可是，在英法對德宣戰的前夜，英蘇間的關係，是，旣非敵對而又非同盟，那末萬「戰事發生，到底英土同盟是不是應當立即付諸實施呢？這，顯然在當時是放在土耳其當局面前的一個重大難題。</p>
<p>那時，以催促土耳其加入英法方面作戰爲最後目的，英法的外交代表們——尤其是現任駐土英國大使的許閣森爵士——立刻就開始了緊張的活動，催土耳其當局趕快答覆。</p>
<p>對於這催促土國當局的第一答覆，是沉默，沉默，再加上一個沉默，這樣子，大概有一個禮拜的光陰，是空空地過去了。一直到我寫着這一段時的事後，在這裏，我們還沒有得到確信其大體可靠的資料，去說明土國當局那時出奇沉默態度的動機，不過，據我個人推斷，那時土國當局對於英法和德國間的戰爭，是否可以發生，以及，萬一發生了，是否可以延長下去這一點，很顯然，是存着疑問的；所以，就暫時先緘默一下，觀望一下推移的事態。</p>
<p>然而另一面，我們却有確實可靠的資料，知道：在那土耳其當局對英法德之間關係保持着緘默時候，而同時，牠却和蘇聯進行了徵詢意見的接觸，可是——又是一個出於當時一般觀察家們的意料之外，雖是有了蘇德剛剛簽了不久的協定，然而，當時蘇聯方面給予土耳其的勸吿，却是「忠於英土同盟。」意思是說：萬一當時德義在地中海，巴爾幹等地一帶與英法交戰時，土耳其可以取得蘇聯的不反對，而加入英法方面，共同作戰。</p>
<p>於是，在戰爭爆發後，經過了一度內閣會議之後，現任土耳其大總統的伊努紐（Ismet　Inoenu）就立刻接見了英大使，吿訴他土國的決議，土耳其始終「忠於和平陣綫，而且始終站在英法的一方。」</p>
<p>又於是，在英國，當時就騰起了一陣對蘇聯這一舉措用意的種種議論，大多數的論調是，蘇聯這一舉，是在促成英法對德戰爭的延長，因為否則的話，脫去了土耳其的合作，英法在地中海，巴爾幹，近東，非洲等地，受着德義重大威脅時，也許在歐洲急於求得草草結束戰事的，因而他們的結論是，蘇聯方面，儼然是在坐山觀虎鬥，以便將來選擇有利塲合，去醞釀一個「世界革命。」</p>
<p>不管如何，土耳其這一舉，當時是大大有利了英法，至少是有利了英法作戰的決心和勇氣？</p>
<p>這一點，令德國當局，對土耳其，尤其是對蘇聯，引起了大大的反感和不安。</p>
<p>因而受了希特拉特別派遺的，赴土積極活動的巴本，也就祗有鎩羽而去。</p>
<p>總結下來，這一次以英·法爲　面德國爲一面的，在土耳其方面的外交戰鬥，是英·法獲得了初步勝利。</p>

<p>個人第一為西靑之曼多列司共得三個第一、二個第二、其决爲西捕之芳塞加、共得三個第一、一個第二、李震中昨連獲高欄跳高兩項第一、殊爲可貴、且成績亦甚良佳、王正林兩英里之失敗、殊出一般人意外、狄麥克名不見經傳、初釘王不捨、及最後二百碼突以快速度趕出、王昨體力情况似不見佳、據謂第三圈時曾被釘鞋踏中一脚、忍痛跑抵終點、竿跳及八百八接力成績俱佳、本屆華聯惜乎短跳人才太差、以致全軍覆沒，而使兩接力賽榜上無名、否則成績當更生色也、</p>

<p>（蘇北通訊）蘇北地方敎育初等敎育及社敎在此抗戰期中其進展何若、年來素乏數字表示、茲從蘇敎廳中得到最近對於各項敎育之統計、亟錄之以供硏究戰時敎育者之參考、（甲）蘇北各縣公私立學校計四〇四八校、學級數六〇一一、職敎員數六二六六、學生數二三八八七九、（省立小學未計在內）（乙）私塾數一二四五一所、學生數二二九六九六、（丙）社會敎育（以機關爲單位）計學校兼辦民校以及專設民校戰時流動學校圖書館體育塲實騐農民敎育館等、共一百六十六單位、本年度各縣敎育在蘇敎廳策劃督促進行之下、均逐漸由殘破而恢復、由恢復而充實、其各項統計正在編造中、據本年各縣呈報預算核定設立小學校數爲二五六〇、級數爲四四四九、義務學級數爲一五〇六、合計校數爲四〇六六、級數爲五九五五、省立及私立小學尙不在內、以數字與上年度比較、已見增加、茲將最近蘇北地方敎育初等敎育及社敎之設施、就調查所得、略誌如左、</p>
<p>甲、地方及初等敎育</p>
<p>（一）健全各縣敎育行政機構、淪陷各縣其刧後情形有漸趨穩定者、如漣水阜寗等縣、則其敎育行政組織、不亟謀恢復、實不足以統籌地方敎育之進行、而漸謀全縣敎育之規復、蘇敎廳除將漣水敎育局恢復、並委派局長外、阜寗縣恢復敎局、亦正着手進行、其因目前局勢尙未能達到復局縣份、亦斟酌地方情形、增派敎委、以厚行政力量、而便措施、</p>
<p>（二）組設甄用各縣敎育機關人員考詢委員會、蘇敎廳於本年在廳內組設甄用各縣敎育機關人員考詢委員會、其用意在公開愼選各縣敎育機關人員、藉以增進敎育上之效能、以後凡各縣敎育局長縣督學敎育委員曁縣立中學校長縣立社敎機關主管人員呈請核委時、除依照規定各項資格辦理外、須經考詢、合格後方得核委、其由廳直接提請委任之敎育局長、亦須先經考詢手續、自此會組設後、所有任用各縣敎育機關人員、一依規定辦法辦理、此實爲愼選人才公開甄用之一法、一掃以往函薦之積弊、用意確甚可取、</p>
<p>（三）調整省立小學、查蘇北原設有省立淮師海師如師石湖鄕師草堰鄕師界首鄕師各附小灌雲蘆村南通徐州各小學、不下十所、至二十七年下半年、省立如師附小南通小學徐州小學、因受戰事影響停頓、二十八年春、淮海淪陷、海師附小石湖鄕師附小灌雲小學亦相繼停頓、</p>

<p>航行歐洲及及遠間之意國郵船、前曾奉命停航、惟在中途行駛之航輪、仍得按照原定航程、繼續駛往目的地、故意國郵船公司之康脫紳田號輪、已於六日駛抵上海、惟昨日據紐約電訊、意國郵船不論行駛南美·北美·歐洲本部及遠東方面之船隻、復於日前奉到　馬方面之政府命令、其在中途者、一律駛往中立國口岸停泊、各方固不能意料意政府之用意何在、但此種舉止、必與歐洲戰局有　、頗堪注意、本埠意國輪船公司、昨亦接獲政府當局命令、將原定今日離滬之康脫佛田號停航、暫留上海、茲分誌各情如次、</p>
<p>康脫佛田無期展緩</p>
<p>美國合衆社上海八日　、意國郵船公司今晨宣佈稱、郵船「康脫佛田號」明日將小開往香港、該輪原定明日開行、現已奉令無期展緩、此間該公司代理未能說明展期之理由、然昨日紐約方面消息、則謂一切義國船隻均已奉命駛進中立國海港、衆信「康脫佛田號」郵船展期之命令、乃來自羅馬者、</p>
<p>退票退關分別辦理</p>
<p>該輪由各客家報裝之貨物、及已售出之客票、昨日尙未辦理退關退票之手續、大約至星期一將由該公司分別辦理、</p>
<p>將自英商碼頭移泊</p>
<p>英文大美晚報去、意郵船康脫佛田號日前抵滬、原定明日（九日）起椗駛返意國、惟本市意國郵船公司今（八日）晨忽接訓令、囑該船停駛、以待後令、故康脫佛田號明日將展緩出口、該船現泊公和祥碼頭、預料將改泊他處、因公和祥碼頭乃英商所有也、惟此點今晨未獲證實、意國郵船公司方面僅稱須待意國來令、</p>
<p>猶太難民索保證金</p>
<p>歐洲猶太難民約二百人、要求提回美金四百元、蓋彼等多係星期四日乘康梯凡地號抵滬、按照本市猶太移民入境條例、曾在意國特里斯特啟程時、各以美金四百元貯存該地意國郵船公司也、據本市意國郵船公司方面聲稱、不論歐局如何、猶太人存款、均當發還、</p>
<p>輪在中途不時停錨</p>
<p>據日前搭乘該輪來滬之旅客談稱、在該輪尙未駛離歐洲以前、郵船公司　通吿此後將再無郵船戰客駛往遠東、故一般搭客、一則以最後機會爲喜、而一則又深恐該輪中途發生問題以爲懼、及至行抵中途、該輪又不時停錨故旅客頗爲恐慌，迨最後安全抵滬、始吿釋然、</p>
<p>內海航輪照常行駛</p>
<p>關於在中國領海以內行駛之意商航輪、據向航業界探悉、截至昨日為止、各公司尙未奉到領事署　方面之任何命令、故各輪仍服常行駛、意商中意公司之德平輪、七日由鎭海抵滬、已定今日午後四時、續航鎭海、該公司之恩德恩吉兩輪、上星期駛入南市船廠歲修、尙未竣事、意商義華洋行　利輪、係行駛　溫綫、現尙在溫卸貨、返滬尙需時日、</p>
<p>意黨領袖表示態度</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、意國苟參加歐戰、旅滬意僑反響如何、頗堪注意、關於此點、記者頃叩諸義國法西斯黨上海支部首腦索奇奧、據答稱「吾人正待訓令中、同時繼續安靜經商、此外、余對大局、無所批評、」</p>
<p>駐日埃使歐戰觀察</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、新任埃及駐日公使倍依、在越日履新途中、乘意郵船康梯凡地號星期四日抵滬、稍作勾留、記者頃走訪之、據談稱、意大利苟參加歐戰、則埃及之危險甚大、因屆時蘇彝士運河當加封鎖、則意國與阿比西尼亞間將被截斷、而意國通往阿比西尼亞之</p>
<p>唯一路綫</p>
<p>厥爲經過埃及也、目下旅居埃及之意僑約二萬人、意國殖民地里比亞則與埃及接壞、英國與埃及訂有互助協定、今埃及不能派兵助戰、唯以供應品接濟英國、舍此互助協定外、英埃兩國並無其他政治協定、埃及有立憲君主、</p>
<p>自行獨立</p>
<p>統治、人口一千六白萬、以棉花爲主要輸出品、日本從埃及輸入之棉極多、而以紡織品供給埃及云倍依原任駐荷蘭公使、本年三月問調任駐日公使、始離荷境、據談荷蘭之遭遇稱、德國苟在去歲九月侵荷、則可長驅直入、極少抵抗、惟在九月後、荷蘭已有士兵五十萬、訓練完成、且法堤淹水、力圖抗拒、然終</p>
<p>不免淪陷、目前荷人身處死境、殊可憫惜、旅滬埃僑約二十餘人、久已主張在滬設立埃及領署、目下已在計劃中、苟計劃實現、則此領署迅將成立、今埃及並無外交代表駐中國、其一切事務、胥由英政府代理，按倍依乃首次來東方、定明日（九日）乘克利夫蘭總統號輪赴日、</p>
<p>第五縱隊</p>
<p>挪僑潘遜氏昨晚假法國廣播電台作第三次揭發德人野心及其宣傳工作之演說、演詞內容、仍係根據德敎授裴斯著作立論、渠稱、德方侵入挪威、第五縱隊之活動始被世入所知、德人利用第五縱隊、在全世界各地佈設電臺、以便轉播希特勒氏之信條云、最後、渠又認爲在各都市中、上海亦爲德第五縱隊活動中心之一、</p>
<p>英方否認收買苦力</p>
<p>上週日文報挑撥中英人士惡感消息、謂英方曾在香港、徵用義人苦力、赴歐作戰、巳經本埠英當局正式予以否認、詎昨日日文大陸報新報、又行刊載「本埠英國當局、在租界內以每人三十元之代價、誘買華人苦力、運往歐洲作工」之消息、本埠英當局、昨日對此再度正式加以否認、而斥爲「全係日人揑造」矣、日人之消息中、且謂「英人此種措置、尙未擴張至日軍控制區內、如英人一旦在此等區域內實行誘買中國苦力、則日方定當採取必要措置、將被誘買之中國苦力、加以逮捕、以資證實」、</p>
<p>法僑徵集衣被靴鞋</p>
<p>本埠法僑鑒於法北戰區擴大、難民顚沛流離、日益衆多、大都田舍蕩然、衣着缺乏、特由聖心道院發起徵集衣着及日用品、舉凡衣被靴鞋、或式樣陳舊、或尺寸不合者、均在徵集之列、並由法僑男女學生分頭勸募、法國無綫電臺昨日廣播、向旅滬法僑呼籲凡有捐助、可送交霞飛路六二二號聖心道院、或以書面及電話通知、當派人領取、</p>
<p>德僑實行廣播宣傳</p>
<p>據密勒氏評論報云、本埠德國納粹組織、最近分發各種宜傳小冊於各界、其中一冊標題爲「一九三九年之戰爭製造者」、該印刷品內標明「德國白皮書之英譯本、內載從華沙波蘭外交部發現之重要文件全文、及其影印拷貝最近將在東京印就」、等語、此項聲明、表示遠東納粹宜傳提網、或即駐在東京、而所有宜傳印刷品、乃由柏林經西伯利亞鐵路寄達東京、然後轉致本埠分發、另有在柏林印刷之一冊、亦在此分發、一共有三冊之多、片輻豐富並載有地圖、據本星期報吿、納粹宣傳組織最近將在大西路宏恩醫院附近之新設無綫電廣播電台實行播音宣傳、據稱、該電臺之電力爲本埠最强者、英國叛徒「呵爵士」、亦將在該電台廣播、渠現在某方管理之電台工作、</p>

<p>平準外匯基金委員會自五月二日限制供給黑市外匯之後、即從事於增厚基金實力、聞購入之外匯、已在百萬鎊以上、原有之平準基金爲一千萬英鎊、據非正式之估計，所餘基金至少在三分之一以上、今從事增厚實力後、該會之基金、愈見充實、足能應付穩定法定外匯、及維持黑市外匯之用、所以將來若黑市匯價波動反常時，即利用以相機制止未嘗非計之得、今市上外匯多頭、似已完全消滅、六月期恐尙有相當數額之空頭、一方不但投機者傾向拋售、即向存美匯者、亦欲易致法幣、</p>
<p>又據本埠銀行界消息、自歐戰爆發以來、香港資金已陸續大量回轉於中國內地、此項回轉之資金、據估計總額的達四億五千萬元之鉅、其中流人上海者、的有二億元、流入四川者、的一億三千萬元、流入昆明貴陽者、約一億二十萬元、大致流入上海之資金總額、與流入川黔滇者相埒、此外南洋各島、如荷蘭東印度及新加坡等地、爲華僑薈萃之所、自歐戰發生以來、亦有大批資金、回轉至上海及西南各省、爲數亦鉅、</p>

<p>晨初以倫教大條、近平遠跌三二五、級的銀價仍平、倫敎生金呆定、滙兌英對美不動、對滬縮零九三七五、對法未更、美對英續長一角三分七五、對滬大六角五分對法升五分半、中央掛脾各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士七五、美滙五元七五、較之隔昨晚收、再吿英緊一二五、美反長一五六二五、此乃匯兌續升故也、開後有利滿懷賣意、雖投機商及外行均有吸胃、終以供多求少、市面即吿鬆動、計有利吐予外行曁華商投機商、六月份美滙五元八一二五至八四三七五、滙豐掛牌揭曉、英匯三辦士七五、仍平、美滙改懸五元七五、猛鬆八一二五、其他如日·呂等匯亦同時掛硬、此後美行亦來塞出、價愈見長、六月份美匯外行入美行五元八七五、而現貨美匯最鬆達五元九零六二五、英金吿三辦士八七五、嗣以投機商仍來購納、且華行忽具買意、市面轉定、故外行出華行及投機商六月份美匯由五元八七五、回至八一二五、迨近午刻、港電略售、計賣予有利七月份先令三辦士七八一二五、市象依然硬化、結果收盤英金三辦士八四三七五、美匯五元八四三七五、本月份現貨價同、七月份英金三辦士七五、美滙五元六八七五、比上日收市現貨英軋軟零三一二五、美則鬆二五、本月份英緊零三一二五、美硬二五、七月份英平美長三一二五、午後週六無市、</p>
<p>香港滙市動盪</p>
<p>香港八日（週六）電、今晨滙市開盤動盪不安、英滙現貨仍吿平定、各均無榮辱、美滙日匯有行無市、中匯現貨升二元、爲三百八十二元、（昨收爲三百八十元）、九時三十五分市面動盪、美匯現貨開出爲二十三元一二五、比昨收鬆一元四三七五、（昨收爲二十一元六八七五、十一時半平穩、英匯仍吿不動、美匯現貨回緊一二五、爲二十三元、申匯現貨升二元、爲三百八十四元、日匯現貨依然有行無市、下午週六無市、</p>
<p>天津趨勢相同</p>
<p>天津八日（週六）電、今晨匯市開盤有行無市、英美滙市步驟背馳、英滙現貨緊零六二五、爲三便士三七五、美匯現貨鬆一二五、爲五元一二五、申匯升一元、爲一百十二元、「聯鈔」暗盤昂一角、爲一百元零五角</p>

<p>昨日匯劃票據貼現率、再步跌不止、每千元之貼率、已破入一百元關內、事在夏節前步跌、甚出意外、乃投機現鈔需要日稀也、上午初貼出爲一百零三元、貼進祇九十八元、後再步低至九十五元、下午甚平、址中價為九十七元半、計再軋小五元、錢業公會拆息、亦復降一分、早午兩市均掛二角四分云、</p>

<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤下跌、英美金鎊因亦動盪不定、卒吿續跌三元、英金票不因黑市英匯趨縮而漲、蓋一般均不願出高價而購也、美金票仍因紐約巿塲之英鎊價格續低、晨初賣氣殊盛、一度退至十七元、後以一般咸測今日滙兌、或將稍轉回風、故大衆需要稍增、卒乃回上至十七元三角、但比上日仍軋跌四角半、香港票則隨港滬匯兌續漲三分、安南票亦升一角半，坎拿大票稍有供給、市價略疲、日金票及朝鮮票均不乏供給、前者退爲一元一角二分、後者降爲九角四分、</p>

<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、隨美英滙兌之上漲、再吿下落、良以人心尙佳、空頭趁低價補進者頗不乏人、是以跌後頻回、結果續小一百四十五元、若依當日美匯結價、則吿撳三百一二十元、論半日過程、晨開即遭猛撳二百四十五元、爲五千五百五十元、後證券帮余號及散戶乘賤咸竭力收進、於買風下立升達五千六百五十元、奈外匯報鬆、另一金號曁某銀號相與吐塞、市象又形下萎、降落至五千五百三十元、結果賴錢兌業維持下、遂爲五千六百五十元收盤、較上日軋跌一百四十五元、收後人心尤挺、續又回起四十元、五千六百九十元曾有成交、半天交易頗旺、的三千兩光　、銀樓飾金掛小十元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚金再跌一四五元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以匯兌續吿猛漲一角有奇、美匯明暗均長、黑市已將逼達六元大關、是以人心極疲、金號等撳價賣出、首由某金號吐予銀號及同業各十兩、爲五千五十元比上日猛撳二百四十五元、嗣證券帮忽來搜購、同時某錢兌業亦跟之猛吸、但斯時某銀號上日浮多、乘機脫售、故回漲尙緩、迨回出五千六百元時、賣者反見轉少、不久價又上升五十元、證劵帮進金號三十兩、爲五千六百五十元、後以滙市依然走鬆、高價難以站定、金號帮趁貴吐出、且加銀號仍有塞出、其中空頭加碼居多、未幾復父慘落一百二十元、銀號售予證劵帮二十兩、爲五千五百三十元、旋後外滙略平、某銀號轉賣爲買、而證券帮散戶等亦有撈入、重又回升、達五千六百元時、某錢兌業多頭傾向了結、奈證券帮吃胃甚健、加之金號亦進、終感買過於賣、續父回高五十元、銀號互做二十兩、爲五千六百五十元作午收價、（收後市象更佳、於銀號帮需求殷切下、再回起四十元、最後五千六百九十元、尙無賣者、）結果比上日軋跌一百四十五元、半天一百二十元上落，現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十數元、收進减低三十餘元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>銀　飾金掛小十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸五白九十元、迨至九時三十五分掛小二十元、十時半回大十元、此後無變化、結果大同行改懸五百八十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低三上元光景、</p>

<p>紗市始跌繼平、實則連朝下落、下跌程度殊深、引起一般獲利者抵補、於是驚虛之市價、突然回升矣、同時華南方面、實需尙稱不弱、因之新買者及場戶又復活躍、但海外棉業狀况、尙在徘徊之境耳、</p>
<p>現紗晨開因英美匯兌續長、美匯又升、市情承上日虛浮之氣續進、二十支雙馬現貨價爲一千一百四十元、旋以買戶寥寥、而多頭痛斬、一霎間市盤直瀉至一千〇六十元、但跌風在熾之後、引起空頭抵補、陡然回升至一千一百三十五元、實則（星期一）十一日爲端節、市塲停業、散空爲免風險計軋直過夜之故也、反動尤劇、查半日間成交統計一千六百五十包、又棉紗昨由香港來五十三件、今日有一百十件、運往香港、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>

<p>本棉交易、非常靜寂、此因世界戰雲彌漫、美印棉市蕭索、加之紗市甚挫、以致人心不振、所以市面呆滯乏勁也、</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初較形活潑、後因現貨商之購買、及一部份之空頭抵補、市况堅定、結果收盤價格較之上日漲七八磅音、印度市况殊感疲乏、昨日連同預測又跌三羅比餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、各方俱爲靜寂異常、同業槪抱觀望態度、故棉市殊呈呆滯之狀也、茲將昨日棉市以美匯五元七五、折合期貨送廠價如下、</p>

<p>近兩朝洋米倐忽不定、然在上午時伏時起、尙稱平穩、迨下午則以金匯變化、及訂貨之電訊紛紛說出、常見回貶三五角、昨日上午猶承此種疲風、晨開人心尙虛、出多進少、但見浮戶甩價求脫、致早市若二號退邏曾跌至五十元零五角、小絞四十九元八角、直待中市、一般小米舖因店積素弱、當此端節結束期尾聲市面、今明有兩日之休業備擬應需、乘廉突進、零銷始吿漸活、繼有內地鄕莊客戶之巨額添辦、而浮戶亦即反出還進、形勢乃緊、</p>
<p>洋米昨市升降變化不一、晨間以美滙放長、買氣甚淡、行囤客販多有回出、市乃逐步下降、小去六七角至近元、旋有本客趁平吸收、兼傳南洋船運難恃之謠、且暹邏等產價不鬆、續定迄無成議、市面父被各方爭買下、節節上升、例如小絞米早市跌到四十九元八九角、午收回漲至五十一元二角、下午一度漲至五十二元、晚收五十一元八角、售價雖有浦東西洋棧與銀行棧之別、（按浦東與浦西差一二角、銀行棧又佔宜一二角）、而行情則有二元左右之出入、即比前日晚收仍較大五六角至近元不等、回籠期貨開二號暹邏六月下一百多噸、價自五十九元至五十九元一角、現洋米七千包、</p>
<p>另訊洋米續有大量到滬、昨日怡和洋行德生輪抵滬、自香港裝來洋米一萬七千二百五十二包、停靠法租界羅斯福碼頭起卸、另有五百九十五包轉運天津、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米、其粳貨昨由內地航船運來者有一千餘包、而早晚兩稻續乏抵埠、傳聞塲外暗盤、因早晚稻去路頗盛、貨主心思亦堅、粳米情形適屬逈異、故售價較有參差、粳市舊盤、常帮特高粳仍爲五十八九元、常崑粳五十七八元、宿貨五十六元左右、靑泗薄稻五十七元、南港早稻五十六元二三角至五十六元、價比增半元光景、</p>
<p>糯米昨日無到、而銷塲業已過令、故巿轉淡、成供求平勻、售價又乏軒輊、開金溧特元依然四十六七元、常丹白元四十五六元、江北白元四十三四元、</p>

<p>小麥　昨市小麥交易、概無所聞、惟近來日廠方面、趁華商搬運困難之際、正向各產區絡　收買、其價均二十二三元、故連日某方時有零星私運來滬、一時尙難證實、在此特殊情形之統制勢力下、華廠方面、惟有靜待將來之餘剩、聞目下各地新麥出貨漸湧、則運輸問題、或可不久而解、不過將來之費用雜項、不知增加幾許、</p>

<h3 id="c104">現代戰的主力——民氣 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>西錢大戰第一期纔結束，第二期已經發動。前綫的消息，各報運篇累牘，已經登載得目不暇給。其實現代全面戰爭裏，交戰各國後方面的情形，對於戰局前途影響也很大。紐約泰晤士報特派員新沂在英法德三國後方，考察民氣，作了一篇透澈的分析，本報記者茲譁之以供借鏡。</p>
<p>英法德交戰國後方情形，已經給火綫隔離了好幾個月。唯一的直接交通，　在空中的炸彈和無綫電廣播。有人從柏林實地觀察帶到倫敦的消息，無　一鱗一爪，都被爭先恐後的探聽　，英國發出的微聲，柏林方面也在聳起耳朶傾聽。</p>
<p>比較起來，唯獨法國人沒有這種好奇心。他們只睜着眼矚　着倫敦，同柏林倫敦互相監視一樣緊張，不過他們同德國毘隣而居，戰爭就在伸們的門口，在閑了的時候寗願談談敵國以外的情事。他們不像英國人那樣重視德國內部情形，他們從來沒有存着德國自已崩潰的幻想。</p>
<p>美國人在兩個月前還想取巧，還想避免作殊死戰。在西綫大戰前好幾個月的等候時間裏，他們沒有一刻不在加緊備戰，但他們同時却痴心妄想着兩件事，去逃避大規模戰爭和轟炸的恐怖。</p>
<p>第一，他們想利用偉大的海軍力和財力，加緊封鎖，窒息敵人。倫敦一位消息靈通的外國人見着戰前瀟灑的老紳士一變而爲準備戰鬥的牛的翰，非但渾身是勁，目有冉接再厲的含蓄力，不禁驚歏着說，照這樣作戰，英國還有餘力再支持一次長期戰爭。</p>
<p>法國却較爲吃力，團結亦不甚堅，軍隊雖較德國爲多，訓練也很精，人力却小及。希特勒所重用的士兵大都是靑年。這輩靑年人血氣方剛，容易黨化，容易供驅使。老黨員就沒有這輩後進熱心了。</p>
<p>第二件事就是英國期望德國內部變化。法國人稱之爲幻想。德國人大多數是厭戰的，他們同法國人一樣的怨着說，「一生遭遇兩次戰爭，太够受用了。一但是英國人却忘記戰爭的本身是一種熔化力。無論國社黨人或反國社黨人，現在都是德國人，同英法人一樣的義無反顧，必須作戰到底。</p>
<p>希特勒的着着勝利，雖是不顧一切，侵凌一個一個弱小民族換來的，但不致削弱的勢力。德國內部反對派的暗潮雖非表面的一致所能掩飾，但是這種逆流，却很少道義上的憤慨。</p>
<p>國社黨從前虐待猶太人，在德國智識階級方面，雖曾引起了一種羞惡之心，但並無什麼公憤。從此以後，德國人民就漸漸地習於殘暴；對於波蘭人悲慘的遭遇竟無動於中了。反國社黨派雖曾譴責這種侵略，但其動機並不是爲着蹂躪隣國人民，而是因爲希時勒失算，把他們捲入大戰漩渦。</p>
<p>英國現在不再期待德國內部變化了。但從遠處着想，不在經濟或軍事方面，而在道義方面，期待德國崩潰，或者並不是一種幻想罷。</p>
<p>這次的衝突，可謂集多數戰爭於一爐。從谷個角度和從十餘國的立塲觀察，不難把握住這决戰爭的含義。這决戰爭可以說是人類史上一大關鍵。捲在歐洲的大浪中　可以覺得這次戰爭，不過是大變亂中的一方面而已。勝負分曉之後，戰勝國如欲再造歐洲，何等艱鉅。</p>
<p>然則決勝的主力何在呢，在於民氣及其忍耐的能力。作者在雙方交戰國後方觀察結果，深信這决戰爭勝負的關鍵在於道義上的力量。</p>
<p>上次歐戰不過是一種過渡的戰爭，所用的武器雖屬新式，但其思想仍不脫歷來戰爭的老調。這决戰爭可說是第一次眞正的現代戰爭，不但是軍隊目是全民族在作戰。後方的老百姓非但是動員了，他們食糧，較之士兵，限制尤嚴，每日工作時間加長，危險加多。因此之故，民氣對於現代戰爭的勝負，較之士氣，自然尤爲重要了。</p>
<p>這種民氣的磨鍊正方興未艾。在西綫大戰開始之前，德國的戰鬥精神同英法小相上下。旣不熱烈，也無什麼破綻。歷來戰時所表現的愛國心，以這决爲最冷淡。軍隊開拔，絕無歡呼軍樂等在熱，這反證這戰爭的悲壯。</p>
<p>開戰的時候，德國人較敵方尤爲厭倦，好像失了彈性似的。他們忍受艱難，强於他人。他們具備着無中生有的天才。若以爲他們不會作戰到底，那就錯了。國社主義已經歪曲了心意，緊張了神經，可是德國仍爲一種不可厚侮的勢力，能够不顧一切的作戰。但是它的戰鬥力確是有限制的，這種限制小僅在於物資，而在於後備力。法國這决是不得已而戰。「我們够了」，「我們必須了結它，」這是法國唯一作戰口號。</p>
<p>最有男氣的却是英國人。這或者是因爲英國人的後方，還沒有感受到德國人的苦痛，或是因爲他們的日常生活，沒有像法國大都會到小村鎭那樣的凌亂。可是英國人較爲脚踏實地。每個英國人都冷靜的知道戰爭爲何物，都相信戰爭會如何糜爛。他們準備被炸，準備多年戰爭後精疲力竭，到末了，會犧牲一切。但是他們的靈魂是不可失去的。</p>
<p>靑年的法國兵知道他們是爲基督敎文明而戰。法國隨軍的神父牧師已經增加了不少。英國人，無論老幼，都相信這决之事是善與惡之戰，旗幟鮮明，無可假借。上自哈里法克斯勛爵下至汽車夫，都侃侃而談着，這决之事是人類的精神同物質的力量之戰，決無半途而廢之理。</p>
<p>英法心理不同，作戰意志則一。他們匪特爲着保持權力領土而戰，並且是爲着保持精神的遺敎而戰，就是爲着他們的靈魂而戰。</p>
<p>德國人的動員發動於希特勒的意志。他確足以代表民族意志到某種程度，但是到了某種程度，德國人民就沒有選擇的權力了。他們是爲進取而戰，不是爲保守而戰。進取必犧牲他人，他們的立塲就成爲失道者寡助了。國社主義的德國絕無精神的力量，這種靈魂裏的鐵，或者會成爲致命的打擊</p>
<h3 id="c105">那維克爭奪戰的意義 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— 伯明</p>
<p>挪威海岸錢長一千六百餘英里，旣不容易保護，也不容易封鎖。該國北部那維克港是北歐方面終年不凍的唯一良港。瑞典的鐵砂從該港源源輸出的佔大部份。德國目從失去了法國羅倫地方的鐵產接濟後，自然完全須靠瑞典供給了。德國從瑞典購買的鐵砂每年共的一千萬噸。在開戰以來最初六個月裏，德國從那維克港所獲得的鐵砂共有六十四萬噸，的佔去年同時期四分之一。除那維克外，固然還可從波羅的海各港口獲取鐵砂，但是波羅的海各港口每年祇有七個月開凍。德國可從這些港口獲取的鐵砂，約八百萬頓。</p>
<p>但是每噸鐵砂所含鐵質，成分不同，那維克港口輸出的全是瑞典北部的基魯那砂，含鐵質成分佔百分之六十到六十五。加里凡爾地方和瑞典中部南部鐵砂所含鐵質成分平均不出百分之四十。因之，德國輸入加里凡雨等地方的鐵砂一千五百噸，僅能抵到基魯那砂一千噸。又况德國許多鍊鋼廠祇能用基魯那高等鐵砂。瑞典政府持有基魯那礦股票的半數，會限制該礦每年出砂的八百萬噸。從波羅的海魯里亞港運出的鐵砂，大部分產在加里凡爾附近的瑪姆堡地方。德國所須解決的問題是基魯那砂能否不向西北運往那維克，而轉向東南運到魯西亞。但是障礙甚多。第一，從基魯那到魯里亞的距離，比較從基魯那到那維克長及一倍　欲保持原來的　砂數量、必須增多鐵路貨車瑞典政府　添造運煤車，本年杪可望交貨。第二，基魯那的砂從山上運下直到那維克。在山麓軋碎混和，即可傾入船中。若運往魯里亞，大半路程雖也可從山上運下，但須起出裝船。第二，加里凡爾運往魯里亞的砂是在加里凡爾軌檢的，魯里亞並沒有軋砂機。照德　計畫，魯里亞必須裝置這種價値昂貴的硬鋼軋砂機，吾則德方祗能從魯里亞將原塊鐵砂運回德國軋碎，但原塊鐵砂　碎後，數量已减少。</p>
<p>因之，德國對於那維克港運砂問題，非常重視。假如德船不能通達那維克，德國雖不致陷於絕境，但必將處於比較不利的地位。</p>
<h3 id="c106">英德空軍比較 <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— 霖</p>
<p>德軍總司令部概括西綫第一期大戰曰，德軍在西綫之成力，實由於空軍之超羣絕倫，德軍當局旣從而獲得敵軍一切活動之情報，目得炸毀敵方海軍，打擊敵軍士氣。其勝利之偉大，可於敵方之損失見之。</p>
<p>英首相邱吉爾則在國會中報吿云，鄧扣克之役，實爲英德兩國空軍實力之大試騐。當時沿海船舶，數以千計，甬海灘撤退軍隊三十餘萬人，德空軍之目標，尙有大於此者乎。此舉於軍事上之重要，亦有更能逾於此者乎。德機一再進攻，均經擊退。我軍完成撤退，敵方所受損失四倍於我。德方大隊飛機幾决進襲我祇及四分之一之機隊，然我機平將其擊退。我國各式飛機及駕駛員，力量偉大，超過敵人多多。</p>
<p>美國陸軍少校薛佛斯基亦在紐的泰唔士戰發表一文，謂鄧扣克英電撤退之成功，實得力於其驅逐機、由具有航空經騐者視之，確屬信而有　。蓋以英國飛機如「烈火」，「颶風」，及「反抗」等式，咸爲驅逐機中之俊俊者。在海峽上空堪稱所向無敵者也。英國空軍如無此種優越之實力，則此次撤退，難免極大損失矣。英德空軍交戰，時間之久，又繫以生死關係者，實以此爲嚆矢。由於驅逐機之掩護，敵人轟炸鄧克扣乃大感困難，而英軍隊之撤退則大功吿成焉。</p>
<p>英德當局及中立觀察家之言如此，茲再將曼哲斯德衛報所作的比較，譯錄如次：</p>
<p>德國陸軍中之飛行隊與英國空軍之自成一軍者小同。其發達如雨後春笋，僅始於一九三二年，即希特勒任戈林爲航空部長時也。職是之故有經騐之參謀將校，及各種敎官，乃常有人材缺乏之虞。然而八年以來，琿思竭力，德國空軍已成不可輕侮之勁旅。全部工業均動員供空軍之用。飛機製造廠咸集中於該國東部，俾得遠離法國方面之空襲。所有工廠設計，要以生產迅速，掩蔽隱藏，及職工舒適爲目的。雖斥鉅金，亦所不惜。其初，此項工作係暗中進行，及至一九三五年九月間，成效大著，空軍二十四隊編練已嶄然露頭角。容格斯式（Junkers）及亨格爾式（Heinkel）一一一號轟炸機亦同時出現。迄至一九三七年，　　亨格爾式及梅塞斯密特式（Messerschmitt）一〇九號戰鬥機即大隊出現</p>
<p>戈林於擘劃之初，有若十問題，亟待解決。彼所渴望者爲大批製迭，因不得小先行決定，德國空軍在作戰時究將擔任何種任務，其决，須選定若干種飛機式樣作爲日後專門製造之標準，蓋任何種飛機，旣經選爲標準在各工廠大批製造，如欲停造，而易以他種式樣，殊非易事。戈林所決定者，似以空軍輔佐陸軍作戰，而不令獨當一面。</p>
<p>侵略波蘭之役，德空軍與陸地機械化部隊，互收指臂之效，此殊爲戈林理想中之作戰方式。就其訓練方式，及標準式樣而言，當時德方諒無與英開釁之觀念。蓋此種訓練方式，及其所選之飛機式樣，皆無飛渡北海，或大規模空襲之可能。德國所選爲人批製造之標準飛機爲亨格爾式一一一號轟炸機，及梅塞斯密特式一〇九號戰鬥機。其後一種至一九三五年始大批製造。其時此種飛機實執全世界戰鬥機之牛耳，所缺者尙無可靠之一千匹馬力引擎耳。嗣後幾經改良，逐漸擴大其馬達力量，終因引擎擴展之結果，於運用上似欠靈敏。其裝置之武器，或爲機關槍四挺，或爲砲兩尊，州不能同時裝配於一機，究應裝置何種武器，似將取決於空軍指揮官。德方理論似以爲戰鬥機之唯一任務乃在擊毀轟炸機，至於與敵方戰鬥機交戰猶具餘事耳</p>
<p>亨格爾式一一一號森炸機開始大批製造時，亦爲一時之選。其設計係在英國勃倫海式（Blenheines機之前，速率亦較英國精銳之暴怒式（Fury）機爲大。德方於西班牙內戰之前，對於轟炸機之設計，早具一種錯誤理論，以爲轟炸機必須具有大量裝載力（大量炸彈或大量汽油，視情形而定）與速率。重武器視爲並非主要，蓋以遭遇敵方戰鬥機時，轟炸機儘可逃之夭夭也。因之，亨格爾式機之前面僅裝機槍一挺，後面二挺，即在油櫃　下各裝一挺。爲增加速率起見，狹長之油櫃上，乃無法裝置砲塔，此則爲英國飛機之優點，非德方一時听能效法。</p>
<p>英國暴風式（Huricane）及烈火式（Spitfire飛機，速率極大，且裝機關槍八挺，出世以來，已將梅塞斯密特式一〇九號及亨格爾式二一號機設計時所依據之計算，予以顚覆、英國重轟炸機　所裝之砲塔，更使德國空軍人員難以應付。</p>
<p>戈林對於新機之補充自亦計議及之。新戰鬥機梅塞斯密特式一一〇號及新轟炸機容格斯式八八號最近已脫頴而出。梅薩斯密特式　一〇號係雙引擎雙人　機，前面裝有機關槍兩挺，砲兩尊，後面裝機關槍兩挺。最高速率爲每小時三百五十英里，尙能掩護轟炸機飛達英國海岸。但如須開啟節汽瓣，以資應戰，則其油量易於吿罄，飛回困雞。梅塞斯密特式一一〇號機亦無力轟炸機羣。蓋以英國飛機上之砲塔作戰力量，殊非輕易可以　付者。</p>
<p>新轟炸機容格斯式八八號爲一九三八年出品與最早之容格斯式相仿，亦注重速率及莊載量，而武力則屬次要。其前面裝機關槍一挺，後裝兩挺，並無鋼甲設備，此項防護鋼板重量，已爲炸彈裝載量所佔去矣。其最高速度每小時三百英里，利於下冲擲彈。但如遇英國戰鬥機，則摧毀之易，初小亞於亨格爾式一一一號機也。要是六架容格斯式八八號機遭遇遜特蘭式（Sunderland）飛船一艘，即無從應付。</p>
<p>此外德力尙有杜尼爾式（Doruier）十七號機。此機與其稱爲轟炸機，不如謂爲偵察機。杜尼爾製造廠現方努力製造杜尼爾式十八號飛船。此種飛船曾甘於安置磁性水雷丁作。亨格爾式一一五號水上機，亦曾用於此途。</p>
<p>德飛行隊活動性甚大。該國飛機塲不下五百處，各色轟炸機隊因之儘可陸時由一地飛至他地，此乃共唯一優點。</p>

<p>諸神對人類的改善，絕無任何建設計　。信邪敎的人，也萬不會想到人的生命，可以造就到更快樂更有耐力的地步。他們的黃金時代，已經過去，他們的大成就已經完畢，他們的最好期望，就是做效過去。邪敎的敎訓，謂人的生命是空虛的，人性不能改變，世界是冷酷無友愛的。在信邪敎的社會中，沒有進步的理想，他的哲擊，是悲觀。悲觀消息，在今日還是很普遍。雖然在改良人生方面，在發現，發明，和科學的獲得方面，有很大進步，對於文化的將來，各方還是抱一種暗淡　觀的態度。我想，頂大原因，是由於這　事　，就是在過去二十五年中，我們許多大希望都歸失敗了。前次世界大戰，搖動了世界生活的基本構造，在人類歷史上證明出來，爲極大的災難。按着大戰之後，就是國際努力尋求和平之道，此時百孔千瘡，如許多危險地帶，捐稅過重，國際債款累累，因戰事而成殘慶的人，無慮千萬，他們都需要照顧和醫治。此外，人們也開始發現他們的政府的腐敗，和挖肉補瘡的辦法。他們對這無力的國際和平機構，失却信心，他們受了歷史上空前的經濟不景氣之苦。因着失業，沒有收入，犯法的時，普遍的增加。最不好，就是基督敎會，對許多人，成犯一種的失望。敎會分成許多派別，對世界任何題，沒有一到的呼籲。許多宗派，忙於新舊之爭，同時街上平民成羣的求作工的機會，他們却不理會。因爲這一切的情景，乃產生了一種自然的悲觀，今日之下，但不論走到那裏，都可以見出這悲觀的證據。</p>

<p>— 仲毅</p>
<p>小朋友，時間迅速，一忽兒，暑期又將屆臨了，或許你是個六年級的小朋友，那末你的心裏，一定担憂着升學的問題，小朋友！你要升學，應該趁早準備了，第一，應請你的老師們，多多舉行假設升學考試，一切辦法，均照眞的升學考試，因爲這樣，可使你有了經騐，以免臨塲畏怯；第二，多做升學考試的作文題目，如：「我的母校」，「我的求學經過」，「投考本校的動機」等等：因這都是一般學校的普通試題；第二，把算術四則，分數百分應用題，多多練習，關於這一類的題目，都要能够應用用自如；第四，選購常識複習叢書，揀重要的看幾遍，如果你能如此準備，那末作文，算術，常識三科，大致已有把握了。升　的準備工夫，也可算得完成了。這只是說到準備問題。上海學校林立，從外表看來，無從知悉其好壤，究竟何去何從，倒也要費一點工夫來考慮，所以其决要研究選擇學校的方法，總括起來，大致有這幾點，學校歷史要久長，校合要好，功課要嚴，敎師要優秀，校長必須是敎育專家，符合上述條件的，才是好學校，才是你投考的目標。當然，你自已也許不知道那個中學校是合格的，那末你可以請敎你的師長，請敎你的父兄，請敎你的親戚，請敎你的畢業同學，總不要隨隨便便的決定，或者貪其容易考取，不考慮再三，而貿然的投考，結果因學校不好，而致中途退學，不但於學業方面，有所損害，且對於時間方面，也未免太不經濟了。</p>
<p>最後，要講到在考試時應注意之點；第一，態度鎮靜，不慌不忙，以免記牢的算術公式，常識問題，因心慌而打了折扣；第二，寫得整潔，萬勿隨意塗改，以免滿紙塗鴉，而給改卷者一個惡印象；第三，遇到一時不能解決的問題，暫時擱起，把能做的先做，最後再想不能解决的問題，最要不得的，是遇到了難題，停住了拚命的想，但是時間是很快的，不容你猶豫的；第四，不要搶先交卷，要知第一個交卷，不是十分榮譽的事，搶先交卷，不免粗心，錯誤百出，而應了俗語一句話：「欲速則不達」；第五，試卷做完後，不要馬上交卷，應該再細細的從頭至尾看一遍，把錯誤一一改正，必至自信毫無錯誤後，然後交卷。上面所述的各點，雖然都是老生常談，或許有的小朋友，已聽得厭了，但是，我相信能够做到的不大多吧，　　！假使你能够照我的話做去，那末你們一定不會名落孫山，勝利是屬於你們的！</p>

<p>光陰過得眞快，明天又是端陽佳節了。在昔這端陽節，社會間對它很感興趣，並且也有很多典故，足資談助的，小弟弟小妹妹們，逢此良辰，有吃有玩，快樂得什麼似的！但現在非比承平之世，我們不應該儘是尋歡作樂，在這國難深重的今日，我們小弟弟小妹妹們，也負有一部分的責任，我們國家要獲取　　　　，雖仗着前方的忠勇將士，而在後方的我們，更須堅毅嚴肅，或者幫助去做救濟等工作，爲國家稍稍盡職，我在這節日，記起了位忠貞爲國，不惜犧牲牛命的先賢屈大夫，（原）他正在這佳節悲憤殉國！且把他的事跡寫出來，吿知我們的小朋友。</p>
<p>按辭源載：（屈原，戰國時楚人，名平，別號靈均，仕楚爲三閭大夫，懷王重其才，靳尙輩譜而疏之，乃作離騷冀王覺悟，襄王時，復用讚，謪原於江南，原作漁父諸篇以見志，於五月五日自沈汨羅江而死一。由此看來，屈大夫旣是一位大文學家，父是是一員忠於國事的大臣，可慨當時昏王用讚，不知看重他，遠被謪江南，以致賷志沈江，與波臣爲伍，這如何不使我們代他抱恨叫屈！所以後人到這日，將角黍投江祭他，以表紀念。</p>
<p>至於他爲了義憤投江，在現在看來，似乎沂於消極的舉動，但在當時，昏君是無可理喻的，除了向江心一躍，實行死諫外，別無他法，但他爲國的一片孤忠，昭然若揭，是値得崇敬的！小弟弟小妹妹們，處此國家危急的時代，正宜從速起來，精誠團結，在可能範圍中，爲國効勞才是。</p>

<p>— 張竹孫</p>
<p>太陽晒得馬路上的柏油有些兒軟了，路上的行人不斷地用手巾抹着額上的汗珠。天氣眞熱呀！</p>
<p>小朋友們一想到夏天，就連想到洗澡了。小朋友們！你們可知道洗澡的益處嗎？我現在寫幾點益處在下面，你們看了之後，想想究竟對不對呢？</p>
<p>（一）淸潔皮膚　我們身體中每天有汗水和別種液體出汗毛空中排洩出來，還有新陳代謝作用後的廢物。積久後，這些汚物就發出一種令人討厭的氣味，使他人要離開你。不但如此，這些汚物能停止毛孔的呼吸作用，使人覺得氣悶。要除掉這些汚物最好的辦法，就是天天洗澡。</p>
<p>（二）刺激皮膚　人體皮膚的內層，有着很多的肌肉，這些肌肉包含着很多大大小小的血管。這許多肌肉和血管都應給它們與外界接觸和運動的機會。夏天固不論，但在冬天的時候，除掉手和臉部外，很少能對外界接觸。假使我們能常常洗澡，那就等於給皮膚常常運動的機會。</p>
<p>（三）避免傷風　每天洗澡（最好用冷水洗。）能使我們不易傷風。因爲洗澡能够訓練皮膚適應驟變的環境。不洗澡的人，一旦遇到冷熱不勻的時候，就會被細菌侵入而發生傷風的疾病。</p>
<p>（四）洗澡能養成勤的美德常洗澡的人必定是個勤懇而有精神的人，試觀西洋人士，他們很愛好淸潔，不問暑寒，天天要洗澡，所以他們無論做什麼事都很有精神，並且都很勤懇。</p>
<p>洗澡的益處，小朋友們都知道了。但是經濟力不足的小朋友們，不能有洗澡的設備，那怎麼辦呢？我要希望他們至少每天用冷水毛巾週身用力擦抹一二遍。這樣也就有洗澡的一部份的功效了。</p>

<p>— 民</p>
<p>以前在跳舞學校中的種種事情，我已記不得了。進校時是一九三二年，可說是很久很久了，此後我所經歷的一切，實在太多，無論是我的媽媽，爸爸，兩位哥哥，跳舞舉校中的敎師，都覺得出於意料之外，就是我自己也覺得很好玩而不大相信的，可甘，有時我總要暗暗地想，這個恐怕不是我秀蘭鄧波兒自己，而是另外的一位小女郎吧。</p>
<p>但是那時節有一個日期，我是記得淸淸楚楚的。這是我一生歷史中，一個最最重要的日期，凡是認識我的人都在說，要是沒有道當初的一天，可就不會有現在的這一天，我決不會在這麼一個電影大公司中工作，決不能在攝影塲上獨占一個平屋，決不會結識許多銀幕上的明星，決不能接到世界各地男女長幼的書信和禮物。也許我不過是一個平凡的垂髫小女，預備上學去讀書罷了。</p>
<p>那時是在初夏的季節。我的第三個生辰是在一九三二年四月二十三日，宴會也已過去了。這一天我和媽媽剛要走出跳舞學校，却見一個大廳事中，有許多媽媽帶着伊們的見女等在那裏。我們一瞧之下，料知一定有什麼不平凡的事情，因爲孩子們都穿着最美麗的衣服，連他們的媽媽也都穿得齊齊整整的。我的媽媽走上前去，向一位太太探問可有什麼事情。那太太見我媽媽，不知道這回事，似乎很詫異的樣子，接着說道：「咦，你竟不知道嗎？敎育影片公司中派了一位導演到這裏來，要挑選二十五個小孩子，因爲他們想攝製幾部關於小孩子的短片。孩子們的年紀是規定在二歲到四歲之間，身子不能高出三十六英寸，大的以一碼高爲度。秀蘭的年紀和高度，不是恰合這條件嗎？你為什麼小讓伊留在這裏看有沒有被選的機會？」</p>
<p>媽媽毫不遲疑的回了一個「不」字，不願意讓我留在這裏，伊說因爲我沒有換一件好些的衣服，怎能見導演的面呢？原來這天我身上所穿的，仍是那件樸素陳舊的跳舞衣。</p>
<p>那太太忙道：「這未免太可惜了。要知這是一個踏進攝影塲的好機會，你要再找這樣的機會，怕要等待好久好久哩。」媽媽不做理會，同着我走了開去。我料知伊心中正在委決不下，可要回去呢，還是留着？因此走了幾步，又停下來了，一會兒却又向前走了幾步。我原知道爸爸雖不贊成我踏進電影界，而媽媽却是很有此意的。末了伊可又站住了脚，對我說道：「別管它，你目留下來給他們瞧瞧，即使穿着舊衣服，也不打緊的。」於是媽媽又回到大家聚集的所在，我記得有一位太太對媽媽說：「鄧波兒夫人，你可知道這家影片公司爲了要招小孩子去做戲，曾在新聞紙上登着廣吿嗎？　說他們已　過五　個小孩　子　媽媽忙道：「想他們是　是要挑選在銀幕上曾有經騐的孩子。至於我家秀蘭，你是知道伊不會做戲的，就是跳舞一門，也還是初學哩。」</p>

<p>— 小田</p>
<p>自從移風社排演了一齣董小宛，中旅劇社排演了一齣葛嫩娘，新艷秋排演了一齣玉京道人，明末的才人藝妓，似乎又引起了人們的注意了。無意中翻到了一本板橋雜記，淺陋的我，起先還以爲是鄭板橋老先生的大作，及全翻開內容檢閱了一下，方知所謂板橋者，余陵烟粉所聚處也，著者爲三山余澹心，也是明末的一個才子，在葛嫩娘戲裹，他同李十娘，都佔着重要配角的地位，他對於李十娘，似乎有特殊的感情，他在李十娘傳裹有這麼一節記載：</p>
<p>「於是流寇江江北，名士渡江僑金陵者甚衆，莫不艷羨李十娘也。十娘愈自閉匿，稱善病，不粧飾，謝賓客，阿母憐惜之，順適其意，婉語遜詞，概勿與通，惟二三知己，則懽情自接，嬉怡忘倦矣。後易名貞美刻一印章曰，李十貞美之印，余戲之曰，美則有之，貞則未也十娘泣曰，君知兒者，何出此霄！兒雖風塵賤質，　非好淫蕩檢者流，如見姬河間婦也。苟兒心之所好，雖相莊如賓，情與之洽也，非兒心之所好，雖勉同枕席，不與之合也，兒之不貞，命也如何，言已，泣下沾襟。」</p>
<p>他說葛嫩娘是才藝無雙。董小宛是針神曲聖，食譜茶經，莫不精曉。卞玉京更了不得，知書，工小楷，善鼓琴，又善畫蘭，作風枝嬝娜，一落筆畫十餘紙。然而看了他李十娘的一段記載，叫人平添了一層影像，可憐這許多女佳人，不怕她多才多藝到什麽程度，至於貞操的保全，還只落得命也如何的結果。我不禁聯想到現代的一般女藝人，爲之流下些古今一轍的傷心淚。</p>

<p>— 錫森</p>
<p>前星期日，卡爾登貼演王瑜瑩王慧蟾雙演貴妃醉酒。宮裝戲自梅畹華息影香島後，無論一二流旦角，咸不敢率爾爲之，蓋宮裝戲爲華貴穠艷之劇，扮相，身段，即化裝，行頭，亦在在以富麗堂皇雍容華貴爲原則，不容有絲毫勉强處，畹華扮相莊艷，身段曼妙，即此已足盡宮裝戲之美點，宜餘子之於宮裝戲，歛手却步，不敢輕於嘗試矣。</p>
<p>皮黃劇脫胎於秦腔者多鄙俗不文，脫胎於崑曲者則典雅有致，宮裝戲自崑曲蛻變而來，故辭藻雅麗，非其他皮黃劇所可望其項背。醉酒一劇，創自鄂伶吳鴻喜，鴻喜藝名月月紅，同光之際，挾技走京師，隸叫喜班，當時戲臺布景，猶未爲人所重視，吳伶演此，則首將臺簾繡幕，換飾一新，於是繼之以淸歌妙舞，觀衆心神無不為之怡然悠然，幾疑置身宮殿之中矣。一時都人士交相稱譽，吳名大噪，吳性甚剛愎，累犯梨園紀律，某次於演唱之際，竟至當塲掠去頭面，與毫下覜衆相詬駡，遂被開除，不再於京師奏技矣。</p>
<p>繼吳而以宮裝戲名於時者，有郭際湘，余玉琴，路玉珊諸人，於是宮裝戲始見盛行，畹華之技，即得之於玉珊者，惟屢經改革，頗多別出心裁處，去老派日遠，今之演宮裝戲者，殆無不標榜梅派也。</p>
<p>演宮裝戲，宜於深宵而不宜於白晝，蓋宮裝戲之優點，完全基於歌舞，歌舞每不易聚歛觀衆精神，此在深宵，則可以使觀衆凝神靜志，盡情欣賞，一意傾聽。至於白晝，則覜衆心神散漫，使演者更技劣，未有不奄奄欲睡者矣。</p>

<p>Luoyang: Along the Changjin Highway in southeastern Shanxi, the Chinese army has been attacking Japanese forces in Jincheng, Gaoping and other areas since the 21st to the 26th of last month, engaging in fierce battles for six days and nights, eliminating over ten thousand Japanese soldiers and achieving a glorious victory. A brief account is as follows: (1) Chinese troops attacking the northern and southern areas of Gaoping engaged in extremely fierce battles with the Japanese in the vicinity of Foshan, Mishan, and Mingshan near Taiyi, Sanjiazhen, north of Yincheng, completely cutting off Japanese transportation in towns such as Taiyi and Sanjia, repeatedly attacking Japanese strongholds such as Foshan, Mishan, Mingshan, and Bagongzhen, killing over three thousand Japanese soldiers and destroying over one hundred Japanese tanks and vehicles; (2) Chinese troops who captured Runchengzhen, south of Jincheng, took advantage of their victory to besiege strongholds such as Tianjingguan and Ershilipu Zhoucunzhen. In Ershilipu alone, they attacked more than six times, advancing to the outskirts of Jincheng and annihilating all Japanese troops who attempted to break out of Zhoucunzhen, killing over six thousand Japanese soldiers, destroying over forty tanks, and capturing six artillery pieces; (3) Chinese troops who captured strongholds such as Caodipu, Lanchezhen, and Jinmiaopu, continued to capture Shanjiancun, Youfangcun, and Dakoucun on the 23rd, cutting off Japanese transportation between Jin and Bo and killing over one thousand three hundred Japanese soldiers. The Japanese in the area have been severely weakened after this heavy blow and are now wavering. We are determined to continue our great achievements and intensify our encirclement and annihilation of the remaining Japanese forces. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<p>Luoyang: Chinese troops in southeastern Shanxi are still fiercely attacking the Japanese in Yincheng, Gaoping and other areas, while a special force has cut off the Jin-Gao Highway. The Japanese army has suffered heavy losses. On the evening of the 3rd, the Japanese south of Nanchuzhai, south of Yincheng, were completely defeated by the Chinese. The Chinese have charged into Yinchengzhen and are engaging in street fighting with the Japanese. On the morning of the 4th, part of the Chinese army detoured to Sudian and Handian (north of Yincheng), destroying more than ten li of highways and electric wires. Just as the Japanese were sending in large reinforcements, they were met with a fierce attack by the Chinese and were routed, losing more than ten vehicles and a large quantity of military supplies. On the same day, Chinese troops outside Gaoping fiercely attacked strongholds such as Taiyi, Mishan, and Bagong (southeast of Gaoping), making rapid progress and killing over five hundred Japanese soldiers. (Seventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>Xingji: Puchicun, west of Gaoping, was fiercely attacked by the Chinese army. The Japanese could not hold out and collapsed eastward on the morning of the 3rd. Puchicun was recovered by the Chinese. (Seventh Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e7">The Islamic World Group and the Future of the European War <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>The mystery of Italy's participation in the war remains to be revealed, while the extreme tension in the Mediterranean situation is clearly visible. Although the US President and the Roman Pope have both made their utmost efforts to limit the expansion of the war and prevent it from spreading to the southeastern half of Europe, the rulers of the three major players, Britain, France and Italy, remain extremely estranged from each other. All diplomatic expressions and movements are overshadowed by active military preparations. If Italy jumps into the whirlpool of war one day, helping Germany to attack Britain and France, the European war is bound to expand and take place on two battlefields, east and west. In the west, Germany and Britain and France will be the main players, fighting for hegemony over the continent, while in the east, Italy and Britain and France will be the main players, fighting for control of the Balkans, the eastern Mediterranean, West Asia and North Africa. West Asia and North Africa, which the world calls the Islamic World Group, are located at the crossroads of Europe and Asia and are essential for military operations, and their importance is increased all the more at this time of war. What is the relationship of these countries to the overall international situation, and what are their current positions and movements? It is worth analyzing.</p>
<p>First, in terms of transportation, the Suez Canal is the eastern gateway to the Mediterranean, and Aden is the eastern gateway to the Red Sea. Britain must consolidate transportation in the Mediterranean and Red Seas in order to obtain resources from its eastern territories (India, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, etc.), but Italy's connection with its East African colonies also relies on the Suez and Red Seas. The two cannot coexist, which is one of the fundamental reasons for the conflict between Britain and Italy. Second, in terms of economics, the Islamic World Group is a producer of wool, cotton, tobacco, livestock, and copper, lead, tin, manganese, zinc, potassium, coal, etc., which are all sought after by Britain, France, Germany and Italy. What is especially important is that the oil produced in West Asia is almost the lifeline of Britain and France. In 1938, 25% of Britain's total oil imports came from Iran and Iraq, while in the same year, 41% of France's total oil imports came from Iran and Iraq; since the outbreak of the European war, this number has increased even more. Third, since the importance of the Islamic World Group in transportation and economy is so great, its military importance is not difficult to imagine, because military, transportation and economy are closely linked. Moreover, the ports of Alexandria and Port Said in Egypt, the port of Haifa in Palestine, and the port of Beirut in Syria are all major bases for the British and French navies; and Cairo in Egypt, Amman in Jordan, Baghdad in Iraq, and Damascus in Syria are the places where the British and French air forces gather. Therefore, in military terms, West Asia and North Africa are no less than the lungs of the two major colonial empires of Britain and France. If Italy joins the European war, it will inevitably attack this region; if Germany seeks to thoroughly strike Britain and France, it will inevitably seek to control this region by passing through the Balkan Peninsula. Therefore, if the scope of the European war cannot be expanded, the Near East and the Middle East will inevitably become battlefields and areas of intense contention.</p>
<p>Since the end of the First European War, almost the entire Islamic World Group has fallen into the sphere of influence of Britain and France. Egypt is a vassal of Britain, Palestine and Iraq are British mandates, and Syria is a French mandate; in other countries such as Iran, Afghanistan, and Arabia, British influence is also quite deep. Although the policies of Britain and France towards these colonies and mandates are quite questionable, they are generally enlightened, as evidenced by the successive independence of Iraq and Egypt in 1932 and 1936 with British support. In recent years, Germany and Italy have used the national ideology of Islamic nations to instigate anti-British and anti-French trends in many ways, and have achieved considerable success. The unrest in Palestine and Syria has often revealed the activities of fascist countries' "fifth column" in the area. However, since Italy implemented its aggression against Abyssinia and Albania, and Germany forcibly annexed Austria and the Czech Republic, the Near Eastern Islamic countries not only lost their faith in Germany and Italy, but also feared that the spearhead of aggression would expand further eastward; as a result, while seeking to protect themselves, they promoted long-term progress in their relations with Britain and France. In 1937, Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan concluded a treaty of non-aggression against each other; then Turkey and Iran signed an agreement of mutual assistance; and recently it has been rumored that Egypt and Iraq will also join this agreement. This is the Islamic World Group's attempt to protect itself. Egypt and Iraq are allied with Britain, so after Britain and France declared war on Germany last September, Egypt and Iraq immediately severed diplomatic relations with Germany; on October 19, Turkey also signed a mutual assistance convention with Britain and France. Thus, the connection between Britain and France and the Islamic World Group has become closer and more resilient. From this, it can be inferred that even if Italy decisively joins the European war and unites with Germany to invade the east, it will hardly be enough to shake the advantages of Britain and France in West Asia and North Africa; and the countries of the Islamic Group will probably help Britain and France by helping themselves. When the war ends and peace is restored, the status of these countries will rise even further. As for the Soviet Union, it is geographically adjacent to the Islamic World Group, but the Soviet Union's policy is to adhere to neutrality and maintain the status quo of small and weak neighbors as a buffer, and it is conceivable that it will not collude with Germany and Italy to plot against the Islamic countries.</p>

<p>Osaka: Major Japanese cotton textile exporters held a meeting here this week to discuss the recent dire situation of the Japanese cotton industry. Those present decided that the main tasks that need to be done at present are to request the government to establish a foreign buying and selling committee, managed by non-official experts. They also advocated setting a minimum export price for cotton textiles and striving to increase sales in the South American market, as it is currently regarded by Japanese exporters as the most promising. Textile merchants expressed disappointment with the sterling market, which is the largest customer of Japanese cotton cloth, with the exception of Australia and India. They believe that if import controls in the British Empire are further tightened, most sterling markets will have no place for Japan. They are not worried about Australia, because if Australia cuts off the import of Japanese cotton, Japan can also cut off the import of Australian wool in retaliation. The situation in India is similar, because the country must purchase Japanese cotton cloth so that Japan can purchase its raw cotton. (Reuters Dispatch)</p>

In addition, although an enemy tank column penetrated our defensive works yesterday, it did not initially break through our positions and, being isolated, is being cleared by our troops. Our troops are still holding all the strongholds and not allowing enemy infantry to rush in with the tank columns. (Havas dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>Paris - According to the latest news, the situation on the front lines is roughly as follows: (1) Fighting is raging from Le Tréport on the coast to Pouilly-sur-Aisne on the Aisne River (note: the canal between the Voisne and Aisne Rivers joins the Aisne River in this town). Pouilly-sur-Aisne is the easternmost point of the front line. (2) The German army has not yet attacked our positions along the Aisne River between Rethel and Attigny, only opening fire with artillery. (3) Yesterday, the enemy attempted to cross the Aisne River east of Soissons but was repelled by our troops after fierce fighting and failed to achieve their goal. As of this morning, our troops are still holding the north bank of the Aisne River north of Soissons. The hilly area between the Aisne and Voisne Rivers has seen renewed fierce fighting since dawn today. (4) Fighting is also taking place on both banks of the Voisne River, especially near the Ourscamp forest and the town of Carlepont (the town is on the south bank of the Voisne River, across from Noyon). (5) The front line between the Voisne and La Bresle Rivers, from 10 to 12 kilometers south of Ham to the La Bresle River, sometimes extends south of this line. In the La Bresle River area, a German tank column has penetrated our positions and advanced 20 to 25 kilometers to the south and southwest. However, this tank column has not been able to hold its gains for long due to the lack of infantry support. (Havas dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>German Forces Launch Attacks Along the Entire Front, Unsuccessful Attempt to Force a Crossing of the Aisne River</p>
<p>Paris - Military sources here have stated that fierce fighting has taken place today along the entire front line from the coast to Soissons, similar to yesterday's situation. Although the German army has launched a fierce attack on the French army's left flank, it has not made significant progress. Today is the third day since the start of the German offensive. Although they have used large numbers of tanks followed by infantry, the French army has been able to hold its positions and destroy many enemy tanks, most of which were destroyed by artillery and anti-tank guns, and some by aircraft. As for the area from the coast to Ham (on the upper Somme River), the German army has made no progress as of this evening. However, in the area from the lower reaches of the Voisne and Aisne Rivers to Soissons, the German army has crossed the Arleux River and reached the banks of the Aisne River in certain areas north and east of the city, and attempted to force a crossing of the Aisne River, but failed. In the middle and upper reaches of the Aisne River, in the area of Rethel and Attigny, German artillery heavily bombarded French positions this afternoon, indicating that a large-scale German offensive along the Aisne River is quite possible. In addition, French aircraft have been very successful in bombing the German rear. (Havas dispatch of the 7th)</p>
<p>Paris - The French General Headquarters issued a communiqué last night stating that fierce fighting continued all day yesterday between the coast and the "Avenue of the Ladies." The enemy disregarded casualties and regrouped large forces to attack along the entire front. Our troops are resisting fiercely. Our forward units, fulfilling their mission of countering enemy tanks and infantry, have withdrawn according to plan. In the area upstream of the Bresle River, enemy armored vehicles penetrated our lines but failed to destroy our strong points and are still being resisted. The enemy has begun heavy bombardment on the Aisne River. East of Soissons, the enemy attempted to force a crossing of the Aisne River, but the enemy forces that penetrated the left bank of the river have been annihilated. Our aircraft continued to bomb and strafe, harassing the enemy, and have dropped over 100 tons of bombs on enemy tank convoys and lines of communication in the past 24 hours.

<p>German Forces Penetrate Fourteen Miles Upstream of the La Bresle Canal</p>
<p>Paris - Yesterday morning, French forces north of Soissons continued to hold the north bank of the Aisne River. Fighting on the ridges and in the forests between the Aisne and Voisne Rivers was extremely intense. Tank battles extended to both banks of the Voisne River, with particularly fierce fighting in the Carlepont area across from Noyon on the north bank of the Voisne River. The German army does not seem to be making as much of an effort in the Voisne River area as in other theaters. Fighting from the Voisne River sometimes reaches deep into the south. In the area upstream of the La Bresle River, German armored vehicle units penetrated French rear areas to a depth of 12 to 14 miles. This force is composed of a combination of armored vehicles and infantry, and its strength is not yet known. (Reuters dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>Paris - A military spokesman said that it is estimated that the German army has used two-thirds of its total armored vehicle forces in the battle, but French infantry is still able to firmly hold its ground to resist them. French infantry, under heavy artillery fire and bombing, has continued to hold its positions and strongholds for four days, repeatedly repelling enemy tank and infantry attacks. After receiving orders to retreat to new strongholds, the French army began an orderly retreat and has now moved to new positions. (Reuters dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>Germany Acknowledges the Strength of the Weygand Line, Blitzkrieg Encounters Resilient Resistance</p>
<p>Berlin - The German High Command declared, "The battles in northern France are proceeding according to plan." However, the spokesman declined to announce the details. It has been admitted that the strength of the French resistance has exceeded German expectations. Officials said that although the Weygand Line was hastily fortified, the German blitzkrieg tactics have therefore encountered a "real problem." Military sources said that the fall of Paris is "a matter of days." (International News Service dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>Berlin - German military experts, in talks with Havas reporters, supplemented the German High Command's communiqué issued yesterday, stating that our army continued to make progress on the second day of the new offensive. The enemy's defense of the Weygand Line was ineffective. Our army has now advanced to the battlefields captured in 1914. The enemy counterattacked with large numbers of tanks but was repelled by our army with the assistance of the air force. (Havas dispatch of the 8th)</p>

<p>Hitler - German forces are making rapid progress in the areas south of the Somme and Aisne Rivers. Enemy forces south of the Somme have been forced to retreat. The elite of the German Air Force has also been mobilized to assist in bombing heavily populated areas, infantry, and artillery strongholds. 80,000 prisoners were taken in the Dunkirk battle. German aircraft reconnoitered the southeastern coasts of England, and several ports and airfields in Dover were bombed. Near Narvik, a concentration of enemy tanks was bombed and set on fire by German aircraft. Two more heavy bombs hit an enemy cruiser. Near the northwest coast of Ireland, a German submarine sank an enemy auxiliary cruiser (14,000 tons). Enemy air forces attacked German territory late at night, suffering minimal losses. Only one residential area was hit by bombs, killing ten civilians.

<p>London - Air raid alerts were issued in eight counties in England yesterday, as several German aircraft hovered over British territory for 24 hours. According to an announcement by the British Air Ministry last night, one German aircraft was destroyed and some buildings were damaged in yesterday's German night raid, but there were no casualties. Although alerts were issued in eight counties when German aircraft flew to the coastal city in the southeast, the material damage was minimal because all residents had taken shelter in air raid shelters after the alerts were issued. Only one town was strafed by German aircraft with machine guns. A loud explosion was heard in Norfolk. A German aircraft crashed in Suffolk. German aircraft activity in England has now intensified, indicating that there will be more intense bombing in the future. This activity by German aircraft is intended to disrupt British air force, naval, and commercial traffic, and is also a retaliation for the recent heavy bombing of Germany by British aircraft. The German bomber that crashed in Suffolk destroyed one building and caused minor damage to other buildings. Two of the airmen in the German aircraft were killed and one was injured. According to news received last night, when German aircraft flew over Norfolk, they flew very high, resembling giant crows, and then flew low, dropping many large bombs on their targets. The air raid alert in Norfolk lasted for 50 minutes. The other counties attacked were Cambridgeshire, Suffolk, Essex, Kent, Northumberland, Durham, and Yorkshire. (United Press dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>London - A joint communiqué from the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Home Security stated that enemy aircraft flew over our coast last night and this morning, dropping some bombs, but the damage to our side was minimal and no casualties were reported. A German aircraft hovered over a town on the southeastern coast for ten minutes, strafing everyone and everything it saw with machine guns. A lifeboat that was searching for a missing small boat was strafed by the aircraft, and the roofs and chimneys were also hit by gunfire. Several people were talking on a street when they were illuminated by the headlights of a passing car and were also strafed by the German aircraft. Three of them quickly took cover on the sidewalk, while the others scattered and fled, but none were injured. (Reuters dispatch of the 8th)</p>

<p>Washington - President Roosevelt recently disclosed that he is requesting Congress to pass laws to allow the government to return old cannons to manufacturers for resale to the Allied nations. This procedure will be the same as the procedure taken by the Navy Department regarding surplus aircraft, and it is expected that some aircraft will be sold to manufacturers for resale to the Allied nations, such as the Navy aircraft sold to the Curtiss Company. New aircraft will not be transferred in this way, but "these new aircraft can quickly become obsolete." For example, Navy bombers recently manufactured are not armored or have self-sealing fuel tanks, so they are already obsolete. He heard that the authorities are also preparing to sell a large amount of ammunition. According to the US Navy Department's plan, the Allied nations will be able to immediately obtain a total of 200 aircraft. (Reuters dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>Washington - Although officials claim to have no knowledge of the news received in Washington from various sources, a large number of Army and Navy aircraft are flying eastward. These aircraft have apparently become "obsolete" overnight, like old cars from last year, and are being sold at a discount. However, what is strange is that these aircraft sold at a discount can only be purchased by the Allied nations. President Roosevelt's statement to newspaper reporters yesterday that "current aircraft can easily become obsolete" caused general laughter, indicating that no one is misunderstanding what is happening. Now that the discounted sales system has been established, it can obviously be expanded to a very wide range, including most military supplies. This method of aiding the Allied nations has now gained widespread public praise. The exact number of fully assembled aircraft ready to fly across the Atlantic is being kept strictly secret, but the minimum estimate is 1,000. (Reuters dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>Washington - It is reported that the US government is planning to sell more than 500 Army and Navy aircraft, as well as a large amount of military equipment, to the Allied nations.

<p>Rome, [Date missing] evening – It is believed here that Italy's participation in the European war is almost inevitable. Authoritative sources report that British and Italian troops are concentrated on the borders of Kenya and Abyssinia and have engaged in conflicts. It is further stated that former Abyssinian King Haile Selassie, or his subordinate generals, are currently leading 8,000 troops to develop Abyssinia. It is unconfirmed whether the King is in Africa. News from London indicates that he is still residing in Bath. Reportedly, 20,000 Italian troops are concentrated on the Abyssinian border, mostly composed of Eritrean and Somali Askari natives from Eritrea and Somalia, Libyan camel corps, and Abyssinian cavalry. It is said that the cavalry is led by enemies of the King. The Abyssinian troops in Kenya may be remnants of the King's old army, having fled across the Abyssinian border in the spring of 1936. They are now concentrated near Oyer-Kenya in the vicinity of Harrington Fort. Authoritative sources here claim that the King secretly left England and arrived in Kenya via Sudan. It is widely believed that minor conflicts have occurred on the border. General Terpono, Commander-in-Chief of Italian East Africa, was yesterday appointed commander of the southern forces. This is seen as Italy's intention to seize territory, as General Terpono is an overseas troops inspector who recently inspected troops stationed in Libya, Abyssinia, and Dotted-Kenya.

<p>Milan – Newspapers here this morning published key points of Italian policy, including: (1) For eighteen years, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has consistently promoted a policy of peace, aspiring to seek new political methods based on fair policies. (2) Mussolini's policies encountered resistance from Britain and France eighteen years ago, opposing Italy's Mediterranean and Eastern European policies, undermining the Four-Power Pact, rendering the Franco-Italian Agreement of 1935 completely ineffective, and distorting the Anglo-Italian Mediterranean Agreement of 1938. (3) When Italians request land to cultivate, they receive the sands of the Sahara. When Italy waged the Abyssinian War, it encountered sanctions, an insult we have not forgotten today. When Britain and France demanded political prices for recognition, Mussolini considered it a humiliation to the nation and refused. (4) Britain and France are fighting Fascism with the aim of destroying Italy's European vision, but a new Europe will still emerge after this bloody struggle. (5) European democracies that despise or hate the Italian people can only be dealt with by force. Italy will fight against the plutocratic politics of Britain and France in order to resolve all territorial issues. (6) The lives of the Italian people are constantly constrained by Britain and France. Now Italy must strive for maritime independence and national freedom. The Rome-Berlin Axis will create a just peace by force. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 8th)</p>

<h3 id="e42">British Treasury Announces New Regulations on Foreign Trade; Foreign Exchange Under Strict Control <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>London – The Treasury Department announced that it has taken important steps to continue foreign trade based on statutory exchange rates and to limit the policy of freely trading pounds sterling on the market. Currently, those residing outside the sterling area will not be issued permits to sell their securities in Britain. Goods shipped to the United States and Switzerland must be paid for with pounds sterling purchased from the Foreign Exchange Control Office at the statutory exchange rate, or with US dollars for shipments to the US, or Swiss francs for shipments to Switzerland. As for transactions with other countries outside the sterling area, the same effect can be achieved by expanding payment agreements and special account systems, as this will allow settlements to be made through official channels in pounds sterling at the statutory exchange rate. Previously, payments required for shipping hemp, rubber, tin, whiskey, hides, and diamonds to Belgium, the Belgian Congo, the Netherlands, the Dutch Empire, and South and Central American countries had to be made in certain specified foreign currencies (or pounds sterling could be purchased from the Foreign Exchange Control Office with these currencies). This regulation now does not apply to any countries other than shipments to the US and Switzerland. Other countries within the sterling area have already done this or will do so. This plan will reduce the amount of pounds sterling that can be traded in the foreign exchange market and enable British foreign trade to operate based on the statutory exchange rate for pounds sterling. This measure will also allow Britain and the countries with which it trades to have stable exchange rates and will ensure that the proceeds from exports are in a currency that Britain urgently needs to pay for raw materials, food, and munitions. Trade between Britain and the sterling area, including the British Empire (excluding Canada, Newfoundland, and Hong Kong), Egypt, Sudan, and Iraq, is currently conducted in pounds sterling, so no exchange rate issues arise. Canada has an agreement with Britain that has the effect of a payment agreement. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>London – Regarding the British Treasury's announcement of the new regulations on pounds sterling, Reuters has learned that the statutory exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar has not changed since the outbreak of the war and is not intended to be changed now. Previously, the pound-dollar exchange rate on the market had fallen sharply due to drastic fluctuations. As much of Britain's foreign trade is conducted based on the statutory exchange rate, some of Britain's exports are now sold in pounds sterling based on the unreliable free market. The exchange rate in the free market differs significantly from the statutory exchange rate, resulting in imports being too expensive and exports being too cheap. The Treasury Department's policy aims to ensure that all foreign trade is conducted based on the statutory exchange rate. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>New York Foreign Exchange Market: Pound Price Fluctuates Greatly</p>
<p>New York – The exchange rate for the pound sterling in the New York foreign exchange market fluctuated greatly today. The pound opened at 3.52 and closed at 3.82, with a high of 3.8725 and a low of 3.35 for the day. When news of the new British export exchange regulations arrived, the pound initially fell to 3.48. Later, it was learned that the new controls did not prohibit foreigners or British subjects from using their pound balances for various purposes and did not prohibit foreigners from holding pounds in London, so the price rebounded by two cents. For example, pounds sterling, except those sold by the Bank of England, can be used to pay for various expenses in Britain. However, the supply of pounds sterling in the market has decreased, so transactions outside the Bank of England will all be small. At that time, the price of the French franc also rebounded, with yesterday's closing price being 2.09 and today's being 2.165. According to traders, the effect of the new regulations on pounds sterling is that Britain can obtain more US dollars and reduce the possibility of speculation, which has been widely criticized in London recently. Today's foreign exchange market caused those lacking positions to rush to buy, and merchants needing to pay for goods in pounds sterling also hurriedly purchased what they needed from several banks. In theory, the new regulations have prevented the continued increase in pound balances, but a huge balance remains that can be sold to those willing to hold balances in London in exchange for US dollars or other currencies. At the same time, well-informed sources indicate that no one can comment on the current size of pound balances, as it is unknown whether London actually has a surplus of pounds held by foreigners or a shortage. Assuming that the world's pound balances are still large, if this money cannot be used to pay for British goods, then a large number of pounds sterling will be sold at prices below the statutory exchange rate. However, theoretically, the demand for these pounds will be limited. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>

<h3 id="e48">A Chorus of "Neutrality" at the Beginning of the European War (3) <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Uncle Di</p>
<p>(3) Turkey's Attitude</p>
<p>(September 17th, London)</p>
<p>After Romania declared "neutrality," the disappointment on the British and French sides is not difficult to imagine. As a result, the widely rumored plan for French troops to land on the Black Sea and support Poland through Romania completely lost the possibility of implementation.</p>
<p>The next country worth noting is Turkey, which has an alliance with Britain and France. When the German-Polish war broke out, and on the eve of Britain and France's declaration of war on Germany, its relationship with Britain and France was roughly equivalent to the relationship between Britain and Poland before the signing of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact. It was an alliance, but there was no further military understanding. However, there was only one difference between these two alliances: the British-Polish alliance was broad and unconditional, while the British-Turkish alliance was geographically limited to the Balkans, the Near East, and Egypt. Moreover, there was a very important tacit understanding as a prerequisite – because the last time Britain and Turkey formed an alliance, it was under the understanding of the Soviet Union, and at the same time, it was determined under the foreknowledge of imminent British-Soviet cooperation; therefore, the prerequisite was that, in the event of British-Soviet hostility or Soviet objection, this alliance could not take effect.</p>
<p>However, on the eve of Britain and France's declaration of war on Germany, the relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union was neither hostile nor allied. Then, if "war breaks out, should the British-Turkish alliance be implemented immediately?" This was clearly a major problem placed before the Turkish authorities at the time.</p>
<p>At that time, with the ultimate goal of urging Turkey to join the British and French side in the war, the diplomatic representatives of Britain and France – especially Sir Hugh Knatchbull-Hugessen, the current British Ambassador to Turkey – immediately began intense activities, urging the Turkish authorities to reply quickly.</p>
<p>The first response of the Turkish authorities to this urging was silence, silence, and more silence. In this way, about a week passed emptily. Even after I am writing this, we have not obtained reliable information to explain the motives of the Turkish authorities' surprisingly silent attitude at that time. However, based on my personal speculation, at that time, the Turkish authorities apparently had doubts about whether a war between Britain and France and Germany could occur, and whether, if it did occur, it could be prolonged; therefore, they temporarily remained silent to observe the developing situation.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, we have reliable information to know that while the Turkish authorities were maintaining silence on the relationship between Britain, France, and Germany, they were simultaneously engaging in consultations with the Soviet Union. However – again, contrary to the expectations of general observers at the time, despite the recently signed Soviet-German pact, the advice given by the Soviet Union to Turkey at that time was to "be faithful to the British-Turkish alliance." This means that in the event that Germany and Italy were at war with Britain and France in the Mediterranean, the Balkans, and other regions, Turkey could obtain the non-opposition of the Soviet Union and join the British and French side in joint warfare.</p>
<p>Therefore, after a cabinet meeting after the outbreak of the war, the current Turkish President, İsmet İnönü, immediately met with the British Ambassador and told him Turkey's decision: Turkey has always been "faithful to the peace front and has always stood on the side of Britain and France."</p>
<p>Thus, in Britain at that time, there was a flurry of discussions about the intention of the Soviet Union's move. The majority view was that the Soviet Union's move was to facilitate the prolongation of the British-French war against Germany, because otherwise, without Turkey's cooperation, when Britain and France were under serious threat from Germany and Italy in the Mediterranean, the Balkans, the Near East, Africa, and other regions, they might be eager to seek a hasty end to the war in Europe. Therefore, their conclusion was that the Soviet Union was apparently sitting on the sidelines to watch the tigers fight, in order to brew a "world revolution" at a favorable time in the future.</p>
<p>In any case, Turkey's move at that time greatly benefited Britain and France, or at least benefited the determination and courage of Britain and France to fight?</p>
<p>This caused great resentment and unease on the part of the German authorities towards Turkey, especially towards the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Therefore, Papen, who was specially sent by Hitler to Turkey to actively engage in activities, had no choice but to return empty-handed.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this diplomatic battle on the Turkish side, with Britain and France on one side and Germany on the other, was a preliminary victory for Britain and France.</p>

<h3 id="e49">British Labour Party Pledges Full Support to Wartime Government for Ultimate Victory <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>London Dispatch: The most noteworthy political development of this current crisis is the change in the Labour Party's policy in Britain. Except for a brief period before 1931 when it held power, the Labour Party has always been in opposition to the government, constantly criticizing it. However, since the outbreak of the European War last September, the Labour Party has been extremely</p>
<p>supportive of the government's war policies, fostering a spirit of national unity. Even when the party still had criticisms of the government, their main aim was to urge the government to fully implement its war policies. This continued until May 4th, when Germany invaded Holland and Belgium, at which point the Labour Party began to criticize the government's war strategy again, especially regarding the Norwegian campaign. This led to a cabinet reshuffle. After the new cabinet was formed, the Labour Party, along with other parties, fully cooperated under the government's leadership, united as one. As a result, the nation was galvanized, and its prestige greatly enhanced. It is worth recalling that during the last Great War, the Labour Party also supported the government, but its method of support was very different from this time. On August 2, 1914, the Labour Party opposed Britain's entry into the war, and on August 6th, their attitude was still extremely cautious. In 1915, they authorized Mr. Henderson to join the coalition government, but the party immediately became divided internally, and its attitude inevitably remained at odds with the government. Various labor unions, in particular, expressed dissatisfaction, and there were frequent strikes. Today, however, union activities are all guided by war policy. Mr. Annas Bowin and other leaders have pledged the full support of the unions to strive for</p>
<p>ultimate victory. The party held a meeting in Bournemouth and passed a resolution by a majority vote to join Churchill's new cabinet. Currently, Labour ministers in the new cabinet do not intend to implement policies specific to their party during this wartime period. The social policies discussed at the Bournemouth meeting will be temporarily shelved. However, matters that are not solely related to one party will be brought to the attention of other parties for joint effort and implementation. For example, the Labour Party's declaration states the need to find ways to adjust wartime life to make it resemble peacetime life as much as possible. This strategy should not be overlooked by the wartime government. Now that the Labour Party has proposed it, it should be easy for all parties to implement and achieve effective results.</p>

<p>The Sino-Western Team Track and Field Games, organized by the Shanghai International Track and Field Association, concluded yesterday with the finals. The Western Police team, with its well-rounded talent, won the championship with 60 points. Western Youth came in second with 45 points, and the Chinese Athletic Association (CAA) took third place with 29.5 points. Following them were the Dongseile School and the Joint Schools team. During this extremely difficult period, the CAA team's achievement is truly commendable. The Games closed yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, with two new meet records being set in the long jump and the 880-yard relay.</p>
<p>The individual star was Mandolis of Western Youth, who won three gold medals and two silver medals. Close behind was Fonseca of Western Police, who won three gold medals and one silver medal. Li Zhenzhong's victory in both the hurdles and the high jump yesterday was particularly commendable, and his results were very good. Wang Zhenglin's defeat in the two-mile race was a surprise to many. The relatively unknown Di Mike clung to Wang tenaciously and then surged ahead with a burst of speed in the final 200 yards. Wang seemed to be in poor physical condition yesterday; it is said that he was stepped on by a spiked shoe in the third lap and endured the pain to finish the race. The pole vault and 880-yard relay results were excellent. The CAA team's weakness was its lack of talent in the short sprints, which led to a complete rout and prevented them from placing in either relay race. Otherwise, their performance would have been even more impressive.</p>

<h3 id="e53">Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education Improves Wartime Local and Primary Social Education (1): Restoring Educational Administrative Institutions in Occupied Counties <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>(Suzhou North Communication) What progress has been made in local education, primary education, and social education in Suzhou North during this period of resistance? Over the years, there has been a lack of statistics to indicate this. I have recently obtained from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education the latest statistics on various aspects of education and am writing them down for the reference of those studying wartime education. (A) There are 4,048 public and private schools in Suzhou North, with 6,011 classes, 6,266 teachers, and 238,879 students (excluding provincial primary schools). (B) There are 12,451 private schools, with 229,696 students. (C) Social education (based on institutions) includes schools running concurrently with civil schools, as well as specially established civil schools, wartime mobile schools, libraries, gymnasiums, experimental farmers' education centers, etc., totaling 166 units. Under the planning, supervision, and promotion of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, the education of various counties this year has gradually recovered from devastation and is becoming more substantial. The compilation of various statistics is currently underway. According to the reports submitted by various counties this year, the number of primary schools approved to be established is 2,560, with 4,449 classes and 1,506 compulsory education classes, totaling 4,066 schools and 5,955 classes. Provincial and private primary schools are not included. Comparing these figures with those of the previous year, an increase can be seen. The following is a brief account of the recent measures for local education, primary education, and social education in Suzhou North, based on the findings of the investigation:</p>
<p>A. Local and Primary Education</p>
<p>(1) Strengthening educational administrative institutions in various counties. In counties that have been occupied, the post-disaster situation is gradually stabilizing. If the educational administrative organizations in counties such as Lianshui and Funing are not restored as soon as possible, it will not be sufficient to coordinate the progress of local education and gradually restore education throughout the county. In addition to restoring the Lianshui Education Bureau and appointing a director, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education is also in the process of restoring the Education Bureau of Funing County. For counties where the situation has not yet reached the point of restoring the Education Bureau, the number of education committees will be increased based on local conditions to strengthen administrative power and facilitate measures.</p>
<p>(2) Establishing Examination and Appointment Committees for Educational Institutions Personnel in Various Counties. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education established Examination and Appointment Committees for Educational Institutions Personnel in Various Counties within the department this year. The purpose is to openly and carefully select personnel for educational institutions in various counties, thereby improving the effectiveness of education. In the future, when submitting applications for the approval and appointment of directors of county education bureaus, county supervisors, education committee members, principals of county middle schools, and heads of county social education institutions, in addition to handling the various qualifications in accordance with regulations, they must pass the examination and be qualified before they can be approved and appointed. Education bureau directors directly nominated by the department for appointment must also go through the examination procedure first. Since the establishment of this committee, the appointment of personnel for educational institutions in various counties has been handled in accordance with the prescribed methods. This is indeed a method of carefully selecting talent and openly employing personnel, sweeping away the previous practice of letter recommendations. The intention is indeed commendable.</p>
<p>(3) Adjusting Provincial Primary Schools. It is found that Suzhou North originally had no less than ten provincial primary schools, including the attached primary schools of Provincial Huaishi, Haishi, Rushi, Shihuxiangshi, Caoyanxiangshi, Jieshouxiangshi, as well as Guanyun Lucun Nantong Xuzhou Primary Schools. By the second half of the 27th year, the attached primary schools of Provincial Rushi, Nantong Primary School, and Xuzhou Primary School were suspended due to the impact of the war. In the spring of the 28th year, with the fall of Huaihai, the attached primary schools of Haishi and Shihuxiangshi, as well as Guanyun Primary School, were also suspended one after another.</p>

<p>(Chongqing, 8th) The Zhengzhong Book Company has recently offered the copyright of all its textbooks to the government, allowing provincial and municipal education departments to imitate and print them locally in order to alleviate the textbook shortage. The methods for imitation and printing are excerpted as follows: (1) Textbooks whose titles are not listed in the detailed list may not be imitated or printed under any circumstances. (2) Provinces and cities imitating and printing Zhengzhong textbooks should be managed by the education department or the social affairs bureau. Primary school textbooks may be handled by the county government designated by the education department. No other institutions or merchants may imitate or print them under any circumstances. (3) Provinces and cities imitating and printing Zhengzhong textbooks should be directly distributed by the educational administrative authorities to schools for students to purchase and use, and should not be sold in the market.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Italian Ship Conte Verde Abruptly Ordered to Halt Return to Europe: Italy May Immediately Join the European War, Shanghai Fascist Leader Indicates Readiness <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Italian mail ships sailing to Europe and the Far East had previously been ordered to suspend voyages. However, vessels already en route were still allowed to continue to their destinations according to the original itinerary. The Italian ship "Conte Verde" had arrived in Shanghai on the 6th. However, according to a New York dispatch yesterday, all Italian ships, regardless of whether they were sailing to South America, North America, Europe, or the Far East, had recently received government orders to proceed to neutral ports for anchorage. While it is impossible to know the Italian government's intentions, these actions are bound to be related to the European war situation and deserve attention. The local Italian shipping company also received orders from the government yesterday to suspend the "Conte Verde," which was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai today, and to keep it in Shanghai temporarily. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>"Conte Verde" Postponed Indefinitely</p>
<p>United Press Shanghai, 8th: The Italian shipping company announced this morning that the ship "Conte Verde" will not be sailing to Hong Kong tomorrow. The ship was originally scheduled to depart tomorrow but has now been ordered to postpone indefinitely. The company's agents here were unable to explain the reason for the postponement. However, news from New York yesterday stated that all Italian ships had been ordered to proceed to neutral ports. It is believed that the order to postpone the "Conte Verde" came from Rome.</p>
<p>Ticket and Cargo Refunds to Be Processed Separately</p>
<p>As of yesterday, the ship's cargo, booked by various passengers, and the tickets that had been sold had not yet been processed for refunds. It is expected that the company will process them separately starting on Monday.</p>
<p>To Be Moved from British Wharf</p>
<p>According to the English-language "North China Daily News," the Italian ship "Conte Verde" arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and was originally scheduled to return to Italy starting tomorrow (the 9th). However, the local Italian shipping company suddenly received instructions this morning instructing the ship to halt its voyage and await further orders. Therefore, the "Conte Verde" will postpone its departure tomorrow. The ship is currently docked at the Gung Ho Cheung Wharf and is expected to be moved to another location, as the Gung Ho Cheung Wharf is owned by British merchants. However, this point has not been confirmed this morning. The Italian shipping company stated that it must await orders from Italy.</p>
<p>Jewish Refugees Demand Security Deposits</p>
<p>Approximately 200 European Jewish refugees are demanding the return of US$400 each, as they had deposited US$400 each with the Italian shipping company in Trieste when they departed, in accordance with Shanghai's regulations for Jewish immigrants. According to the local Italian shipping company, the Jewish refugees' deposits will be returned regardless of the situation in Europe.</p>
<p>Ship Anchored Frequently En Route</p>
<p>According to passengers who recently arrived in Shanghai on the ship, before the ship left Europe, the shipping company announced that there would be no more passenger ships sailing to the Far East. Therefore, passengers were both happy to have this last opportunity and fearful that the ship would encounter problems en route. As it turned out, the ship anchored frequently en route, causing considerable panic among the passengers. They were only relieved when they finally arrived safely in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Coastal Ships Operate as Usual</p>
<p>Regarding Italian merchant ships operating within Chinese territorial waters, it was learned from shipping industry sources that as of yesterday, the companies had not received any orders from the consulate. Therefore, the ships are still operating as usual. The Italian merchant ship "Deping," owned by the Sino-Italian Company, arrived in Shanghai from Zhenhai on the 7th and is scheduled to continue to Zhenhai at 4:00 PM today. The company's ships "Ende" and "Engel" entered the Nanshi Shipyard last week for annual repairs and have not yet been completed. The Italian merchant ship "Liri," owned by the Italian Hua Yang Company, operates on the Wenzhou route and is currently unloading cargo in Wenzhou. It will take some time to return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Italian Party Leader Expresses Stance</p>
<p>According to the English-language "North China Daily News," the reaction of the Italian community in Shanghai if Italy joins the European war is noteworthy. Regarding this point, a reporter recently asked Sorcio, the head of the Shanghai branch of the Italian Fascist Party. He replied, "We are awaiting instructions. In the meantime, we continue to conduct business quietly. Beyond that, I have no comment on the overall situation."</p>
<p>Egyptian Envoy to Japan Observes European War</p>
<p>According to the English-language "North China Daily News," the newly appointed Egyptian Minister to Japan, Bey, arrived in Shanghai on the Italian ship "Conte Verde" on Thursday en route to his new post in Japan. He stayed briefly, and a reporter interviewed him. He said that if Italy joins the European war, Egypt would be in great danger, as the Suez Canal would be closed at that time, severing the connection between Italy and Abyssinia.</p>
<p>The only route</p>
<p>to Abyssinia is through Egypt. Currently, there are approximately 20,000 Italian expatriates living in Egypt, and the Italian colony of Libya borders Egypt. Britain and Egypt have a mutual assistance agreement. While Egypt cannot send troops to assist in the war, it can supply Britain with provisions. Apart from this mutual assistance agreement, there are no other political agreements between Britain and Egypt. Egypt has a constitutional monarch</p>
<p>ruling</p>
<p>independently, with a population of 16 million. Cotton is its main export, and Japan imports a great deal of cotton from Egypt and supplies Egypt with textiles. Bey was originally the Minister to the Netherlands and was transferred to Japan this March. He said that if Germany had invaded the Netherlands last September, it could have driven straight in with very little resistance. However, after September, the Netherlands had 500,000 trained soldiers and had flooded the polders in an attempt to resist, but ultimately</p>
<p>could not avoid falling. Currently, the Dutch are in a dire situation and are to be pitied. There are approximately 20 Egyptian expatriates in Shanghai who have long advocated for the establishment of an Egyptian consulate in Shanghai. It is currently being planned, and if the plan is realized, the consulate will be established soon. Currently, Egypt does not have a diplomatic representative stationed in China, and all its affairs are handled by the British government. Bey is visiting the East for the first time and is scheduled to depart for Japan on the President Cleveland tomorrow (the 9th).</p>
<p>Fifth Column</p>
<p>Last night, Norwegian expatriate Mr. Ponson gave his third speech at the French broadcasting station exposing German ambitions and propaganda efforts. The content of his speech was still based on the theories in the works of German Professor Peth. He stated that the activities of the German Fifth Column first came to the world's attention with the German invasion of Norway. The Germans used the Fifth Column to set up radio stations all over the world in order to broadcast Hitler's doctrines. Finally, he also believes that among all cities, Shanghai is also one of the centers of activity for the German Fifth Column.</p>
<p>British Side Denies Buying Coolies</p>
<p>Last week, a Japanese newspaper stirred up ill feelings between Chinese and British people with a report that the British side had conscripted Chinese coolies in Hong Kong to go to Europe to fight. The British authorities in Shanghai have officially denied this. However, yesterday, the Japanese newspaper "Continental News" again published a report that "the British authorities in Shanghai are enticing Chinese coolies to work in Europe within the concession at a price of 30 yuan per person." The British authorities in Shanghai officially denied this again yesterday and denounced it as "entirely fabricated by the Japanese." The Japanese report also stated that "this British measure has not yet been extended to the areas controlled by the Japanese army. If the British were to entice and buy Chinese coolies in these areas, the Japanese would definitely take the necessary measures to arrest the enticed Chinese coolies for verification."</p>
<p>French Community Collecting Clothing, Bedding, and Boots</p>
<p>In view of the expansion of the war zone in northern France and the increasing number of displaced refugees, most of whom have lost their homes and lack clothing, the French community in Shanghai has launched a campaign to collect clothing and daily necessities through the Sacred Heart Convent. All types of clothing, bedding, and boots, whether old-fashioned or of the wrong size, are being collected, and French expatriate male and female students are separately canvassing for donations. The French radio station broadcast yesterday, calling on the French community in Shanghai to send donations to the Sacred Heart Convent at 622 Avenue Joffre or to notify them in writing or by telephone, and they will send someone to collect them.</p>
<p>German Community Conducting Broadcast Propaganda</p>
<p>According to the "Millard's Review," the German Nazi organization in Shanghai has recently been distributing various propaganda pamphlets to various sectors. One of the pamphlets is titled "The Warmakers of 1939." The publication states, "An English translation of the German White Book, containing the full text and photocopies of important documents discovered in the Polish Foreign Ministry in Warsaw, will soon be printed in Tokyo." This statement indicates that the Far East Nazi propaganda network is based in Tokyo, and all propaganda publications are sent from Berlin to Tokyo via the Trans-Siberian Railway, and then forwarded to Shanghai for distribution. There is also another pamphlet printed in Berlin being distributed here, making a total of three pamphlets. The pamphlets are rich in content and include maps. According to this week's report, the Nazi propaganda organization will soon begin broadcasting propaganda on the newly established radio station near the Hong'en Hospital on Great West Road. It is said that the station's power is the strongest in Shanghai. The British traitor "Lord Haw-Haw" will also broadcast on the station. He is currently working at a radio station managed by someone.</p>

<p>Since restricting the supply of foreign exchange on the black market on May 2nd, the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee has been working to increase the strength of the fund. It is reported that it has purchased over one million pounds in foreign exchange. The original stabilization fund was ten million pounds. According to informal estimates, at least one-third of the fund remains. Now that it has been strengthened, the committee's fund is even more substantial and capable of stabilizing the statutory exchange rate and maintaining the black market exchange rate. Therefore, if the black market exchange rate fluctuates abnormally in the future, it can be used to prevent it. Currently, it seems that the foreign exchange bulls in the market have completely disappeared. There may still be a considerable amount of short positions in June. Not only are speculators inclined to sell, but those who have US dollars are also wanting to exchange them for legal tender.</p>
<p>According to news from the banking community in Shanghai, since the outbreak of the European war, Hong Kong capital has been returning to mainland China in large quantities. It is estimated that the total amount of capital returned is as high as 450 million yuan, of which 200 million yuan flowed into Shanghai, 130 million yuan flowed into Sichuan, and approximately 120 million yuan flowed into Kunming and Guiyang. The total amount of capital flowing into Shanghai is roughly equivalent to that flowing into Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan. In addition, the islands of Southeast Asia, such as the Dutch East Indies and Singapore, are the places where overseas Chinese gather. Since the outbreak of the European war, a large amount of capital has also returned to Shanghai and the southwestern provinces, and the amount is also huge.</p>

<p>The Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association held a fundraising rally for cheap rice sales in the Ningbo region the day before yesterday. The circumstances of the meeting were reported yesterday. It is now known that a motion was proposed at the meeting to slightly levy an export passage certificate fee in the Ningbo area: 10 yuan per merchant and 5 yuan per other villager. All expressed opposition and requested the association find a way to cancel it to benefit the villagers. The association immediately telegraphed the Sixth District Commissioner Xu and the Yin County Magistrate, requesting prompt cancellation to appease public hopes.</p>
<p>Continuing Rice Transport</p>
<p>It is also known that in addition to the previous transport of cheap rice to Ningbo by the "Glen" ship, the "Dapu" ship will continue to transport rice from Hong Kong, with 10,000 bags allocated to the Ningbo area. An additional 50% water transport fee will be added, aiming to collect 300,000 yuan to be allocated to disaster relief donations. It was originally planned to start collecting the fee on the 6th of this month. However, according to a report from the Datong News Agency, after the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow-Villagers Association sent representatives to Ningbo to stop this, the fee has also been cancelled. The association has also scheduled a second fundraising rally for the 22nd of this month, aiming to raise 2 million yuan.</p>
<p>Relief Measures</p>
<p>According to the Shaoxing Fellow-Villagers Association in Shanghai yesterday, Zhejiang Province Chairman Huang Shaohong, accompanied by Wang Wenhan, Zhu Huiqing, and other important officials, went to inspect the county administration of the four counties of Rui'an, Wenling, etc. last month and also consulted on resolving the entire food problem in Zhejiang Province. It is said that a solution has been planned. It is understood that due to diligent winter cultivation last year, Taizhou's wheat crop is lush and expected to increase production by hundreds of thousands of dan. The new wheat will soon be on the market, and early rice will also be available in a month. As Taizhou has a surplus of rice, the rice price has fallen to more than ten jin per yuan. This time, Chairman Huang personally visited Taizhou and instructed the counties to purchase the surplus rice. In the last month, 70,000 dan were shipped, and in the future, 200,000 dan will be shipped each month to continuously supply the cities and counties of Ningbo and Shaoxing. In addition to the funds allocated by the provincial treasury for purchasing grain, the Four Banks have already advanced 1.5 million yuan. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also issued an electrical instruction ordering the Four Banks Joint Treasury to approve an additional loan of 3 million yuan. Chairman Huang also personally instructed the coastal counties that if smuggled food is discovered, the local county grain office or county government should purchase it at a fixed price, and the entire price will be given to the discoverers as a reward. Smugglers will be severely punished according to the law. With such heavy rewards and strict punishments, the trend of smuggling should be suppressed. As for the surplus grain of large households and rice hoarding by merchants in various counties, the authorities in various counties have also been ordered to forcibly purchase it. Anyone who resists will be punished according to the regulations on hoarding and speculation, sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years, and fined more than three times the value of all possessions. Measures have also been established to severely punish those who manipulate prices and engage in speculation, treating them as disrupting public order.</p>

<p>According to a Pingming News Agency reporter, the Price Stabilization Committee of the French Concession and the Price Committee of the Public Concession are continuing to study a unified rice market plan to regulate the rice and grain situation. The Price Stabilization Committee intends to abolish the current unfair price control method and implement a new method to promote fair and legitimate transactions in the rice market. They hope that rice merchants will strive to reorganize the normal supply of national rice in Shanghai and make rice prices more reasonable, but they also reserve the right to punish all malpractices in accordance with Consul General’s Order No. 78.</p>
<p>Market Improvement</p>
<p>To improve the rice market on a broader and more formal basis, the measures are as follows: (1) All rice merchants engaged in wholesale business must be forced to join the rice market. (2) All rice market brokers must register in this market and pay a sufficient deposit. (3) All rice merchants must register all rice sales transactions in their store accounts and also record them in a book with stubs, and the pages recorded in the book should be torn off and given to the customers. (4) All wholesale rice trade in this city must be concentrated in this market, and the current system of purchasing at least ten bags at a time must be maintained. (5) Actual sales prices should be posted and announced daily. (6) Statistical tables should be prepared daily, recording rice imports, rice exports, warehouse inventory, and rice market locations.</p>
<p>Cost Assessment</p>
<p>In addition, a central statistics bureau will be organized to register the official prices and shipping costs of various types of foreign rice twice a week, so as to understand the exchange rate and the unloading and warehousing costs in this city, which will facilitate accurate cost assessment. The collection of various statistical materials will also make it easier to monitor the situation and evolution of the rice market, and to compile an objective document for the local press to inform the public of the true situation of the rice market.</p>

<p>A special dispatch from Tokyo on June 7th from the North-China Daily News states that the Japanese army and navy authorities are deeply concerned about reports denying that the Shanghai French Concession is planning to be handed over to the American authorities. Therefore, the tense situation in Tokyo caused by rumors of changes in the status of the French Concession has eased.</p>
<p>Japanese Consulate Clarifies Misunderstanding</p>
<p>(Omitted above) In order to clarify these rumors, Consul General Miura visited French Consul General Ougier on the morning of the 7th to inquire about the truth. Ougier stated clearly that these rumors were completely unfounded and that there was no consideration of changing the current status of the French Concession, either now or in the future. He also stated that he fully understood the Japanese position, which attached great importance to maintaining peace and security in the vicinity of Shanghai. Subsequently, Miura visited the American Acting Consul General, Patrick, to inquire about the matter. The American Acting Consul General also completely denied the rumors, stating frankly that they were completely unfounded. According to reports, the rumors of the French Concession being transferred to the American side were originally published in Japanese newspapers, and were not heard of outside.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Salvation Army Responsible for Relief of Beggars and Refugees in the City, Entrusted by Shanghai Municipal Council and Rotary Club, Concessions Allocate Funds for Indirect Assistance <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily, representatives from the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, the Rotary Club, and the Salvation Army held a meeting earlier this week to discuss funding for relief work and requested the Salvation Army to be responsible for caring for the city's beggars and elderly and infirm refugees. Brigadier B. Morris, leader of the Salvation Army in Shanghai, telegraphed the Salvation Army headquarters in London to request approval. This matter has not yet been decided, but it is reported that the Municipal Council has agreed to continuously allocate funds from entertainment donations and French merchant charity lotteries to indirectly assist the Salvation Army. The Rotary Club will also actively participate in fundraising to promote relief work.</p>
<p>Number of Beggars</p>
<p>The Public Concession Police Department counted the number of beggars begging for a living on the roads of the Public Concession south of Suzhou Creek on the 26th, 27th, and 28th of last month, totaling only 2,000 people. According to police sources yesterday (7th), this is an approximate number, and it is believed that there are another 500 beggars in the French Concession. As for the number of beggars in the areas north of Suzhou Creek, no count was taken, but it is estimated that there are at least 4,000 impoverished refugees north of the Huangpu River who do not live in shelters, making a living difficult. According to figures released by the Municipal Council, there are 20,410 refugees in the sixteen shelters south of Suzhou Creek this week.</p>
<p>Degree of Evacuation</p>
<p>According to Brigadier Morris yesterday, it is difficult to reduce the number of refugees to below 10,000, and they will permanently rely on the public in this city for support, as these are all elderly, young, and disabled people. The Salvation Army will take in these elderly, weak, and disabled refugees and beggars in the Dunxin Road shelter according to the new relief plan. The work of dispersing refugees is continuing smoothly. However, after the number of refugees is reduced to below 20,000, the dispersal work will be greatly slowed down, because those who are strong and healthy have already been sent back to their hometowns, and those who remain are mostly elderly and weak, making it difficult to persuade them to leave the shelter.</p>
<p>No Coercion</p>
<p>As for the dispersal of refugees, adults receive a dispersal fee of 15 yuan and travel expenses of 3 yuan, while children receive 10 yuan. Brigadier Morris added that when he met with those who initiated the beggar relief plan on Thursday evening, he strongly opposed the use of coercive measures to accelerate the dispersal of refugees. In fact, Shanghai now has a minor wartime refugee problem. In 1937, there were as many as 275,000 refugees in this city, which has now been reduced to 20,000. A city with such a large population as this city has no difficulty in caring for 20,000 refugees.</p>
<p>Concession Investigation</p>
<p>The Public Concession Police Department investigated the number of beggars in the concession as follows: The average for the three days from May 26th to 28th was 1,190 during the day, including 920 male beggars and 270 female beggars (including 65 with sores or missing limbs, 67 cripples, 80 with children, 152 elderly, and 826 able-bodied). There were 936 beggars at night, including 785 males and 151 females (including 44 with sores or missing limbs, 49 cripples, 53 with children, 25 elderly, and 675 able-bodied). In the area outside the concession, the average for the three days from May 26th to 28th was 72 beggars during the day, including 42 males and 30 females (including 5 with sores or missing limbs, 3 cripples, 15 with children, 8 elderly, and 41 able-bodied). There was an average of 48 at night, including 27 males and 21 females (including 5 with sores or missing limbs, 2 cripples, 15 with children, 6 elderly, and 20 able-bodied).</p>

Due to high prices, although some young and strong refugees have been relocated, more than 30,000 refugees who are homeless and weak and disabled must be provided with long-term relief. The expenses for food, medicine, and education are still vast. As the Dragon Boat Festival is approaching, various circles usually have the custom of giving gifts or holding festive banquets. At this time of difficulty, the association specially appeals to all circles to save these expenses and contribute to the refugees.

<p>According to the English-language China Press, regarding the matter of "Shanghai Mayor" Fu Xiaoan demanding from the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession the archives and maps stored by the Land Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Government, according to sources from the Consular Body, these archives, totaling 312 boxes, were originally handed over to the French Concession by Mayor Yu Hongjun when the Chinese army moved west for preservation. In early 1938, the Municipal Council took out the archives from the French Municipal Council and took over the management. Last year, it was rumored that the Consular Body was asked to hand over these archives, but the Consular Body replied that it knew nothing about it. It was rumored that Fu then consulted with the Municipal Council, and the Bureau reported to the Consular Body, but the Consular Body hoped that the Municipal Council would resolve it themselves.</p>
<p>Self-Resolution</p>
<p>Afterwards, Fu negotiated several times, but the Municipal Council did not respond. It was not until recently that it announced that the Consular Body was discussing the matter. It is rumored that Fu stated that if the Municipal Council did not hand over these archives, he would declare them "invalid." It is also heard that Fu threatened to file a lawsuit with the Consular Court.</p>

<p>The Changde ship of Italian merchant Rochefort Shipping Agency, represented by Jufeng Customs Brokerage and handled by Yuanji Customs Brokerage, returned to Shanghai from Ningbo the day before yesterday (7th) at midnight and entered the Wusongkou. At about 11:00 PM by Customs time, when it reached the Huangpu River in front of the New Customs Wharf, the Japanese ship Huaguo, heading north on the North Sand Line, departed from Anchorage No. 2. The two ships met at that location, heading towards each other. Each sounded its whistle to indicate that it would yield to the west bank, but unexpectedly, both ships yielded towards the west bank. There was a risk of collision at the time. Changde urgently yielded into the river, but in an instant, the two ships grazed each other. The sampan on the Changde's deck was immediately crushed, and the iron plates on the starboard side were also damaged in several places. The damage to the ship's hull was minor. However, the Huaguo ship was made of wood and was smaller in tonnage. It suffered severe damage after the collision, making it unable to depart and suspending its voyage. It has already entered the shipyard for repairs. It is also heard that six passengers fell into the water when the Huaguo was leaving port, two of whom were rescued, while the whereabouts of four are unknown. As for the issue of responsibility, it is still under investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e73">Spy Apprehended in London Had Wandered in Shanghai, Used Fake Checks to Stay at the International Hotel, Traveled Freely in Shanghai, Married Russian Woman, Went from Shanghai to Haiphong to Hong Kong and Flew to London <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, an American named "Dr. Newton" recently used forged checks in Shanghai. The American authorities wanted to arrest him, but he repeatedly evaded capture and went to London, where he was eventually arrested on suspicion of espionage. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Fraudulently Obtained Passport, Arrived in Shanghai from the Philippines</p>
<p>"Dr. Newton," aged 30, is suspected to be Schunall, a former pharmacist in the U.S. Navy. On February 3 this year, he arrived in Shanghai from Manila. It is reported that he was heavily in debt in Manila, so he fraudulently obtained passport No. 255 and came to Shanghai. He opened a room at the International Hotel and presented a check from the "Mississippi Valley Bank Trust Company of St. Louis, Missouri, USA" for US$5,000 to the International Hotel management as collateral.</p>
<p>Met Russian Woman, Married in Church</p>
<p>He then traveled freely in the city, issued multiple checks, and met a White Russian woman named Lepechieva. He claimed to be a doctor who graduated from an American university. On March 2, they held a wedding ceremony in a church. The U.S. Consulate sent a representative to witness the wedding.</p>
<p>Inspected Check, Immediately Determined It Was Forged</p>
<p>By mid-March, the International Hotel management had become suspicious and presented the check held by Newton to the authorities. Mr. Shields, the prosecutor of the U.S. Court for China, inspected the check and immediately determined that it was forged, because Mr. Shields was from Missouri and knew that there was a "Mississippi Valley Trust Company," but there was no "Mississippi Bank Trust Company."</p>
<p>Searched Everywhere, Unable to Capture</p>
<p>An investigation was launched and it was discovered that Newton had used forged checks to merchants in the city. An arrest warrant was issued on March 21. However, Newton had already received word of it and disappeared at 5:15 AM on March 21, a few hours before the arrest. It was then learned that he had gone to the recruitment office of the French Foreign Legion on Avenue Foch in the city and enlisted. Upon further investigation, the French authorities learned that Newton had arrived in Haiphong, Vietnam. Mr. Shields immediately telegraphed the U.S. Consulate in Haiphong to arrest Newton, but before they could act, Newton had disappeared again.</p>
<p>Originally Russian, Repeatedly Committed Fraud</p>
<p>Last year, a ship captain reported that he had seen Newton in Hong Kong. Mr. Shields again sent a wireless message to the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong, requesting Newton's immediate arrest. However, he had already left Hong Kong for London the day before yesterday. Not long after, he was finally caught in London on suspicion of espionage. According to information received by the U.S. authorities in the city, Newton was originally Russian, but became a naturalized American. He usually used many aliases and had repeatedly committed fraud. Last year, he was deported from the U.S. by the U.S. authorities and voluntarily left the U.S. for Manila on March 20.</p>

<p>Yesterday, two kidnapping cases occurred in the two concessions. The kidnapped victims were both young students, one named Yang Litai, and the other's name is unknown. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Gangsters Lured and Hijacked Xiang Sheng Motors</p>
<p>At around 7:19 yesterday morning, the Changping Road branch of Xiang Sheng Motors in western Shanghai suddenly received a phone call to hire a car to Kang Nao Tu Road (Connaught Road) and Jiao Zhou Road. The manager dispatched driver Shi Shougao, a resident of Chongming, in car number 357 with license plate number 18463. Upon arrival, a man in a long gown boarded the car and ordered the driver to go to Singapore Road. When they arrived there, two people suddenly emerged from the side of the road, holding guns, and blocked the way. They forced the driver out of the car, stripped him of his uniform and hat, and one of the men put them on, disguising himself as the driver. They drove the car towards the area of the extraterritorial roads. The two bandits took the driver Shi Shougao to a nearby remote location to monitor his actions.</p>
<p>Young Student Kidnapped by Bandits</p>
<p>About half an hour later, the two bandits gave him three yuan as money for refreshments, forbidding him to make any noise, and then ordered him to leave. At around 9 o'clock, at the public bus stop on Jiao Zhou Road, a student wearing a light gray suit, with glasses on his nose, about eighteen or nineteen years old, stood alone at the bus stop with several books in his hand. Car number 18463 suddenly drove up and stopped abruptly. Six people jumped out of the car, dressed in various styles of long and short clothing. Without asking any questions, they pulled out guns to intimidate and forced the student into the car, driving towards western Shanghai. Later, passersby called two Chinese constables numbered 2692 and 1719, but the bandits had already sped away and disappeared.</p>
<p>Foreign Woman Reports to the Police Station</p>
<p>At this time, a foreign woman named Li Yili (transliteration), who was waiting for a public bus at Guang Fa, witnessed the details and reported them to the Gordon Road Police Station by phone. Shortly after, the driver, Shi Shougao, also went to the police station to report the incident. However, the student's name was unknown because the incident happened on the side of the road and there was no way to find out. The police station is now waiting for the missing student's family to report to the police station as soon as they receive the news so that the case can be solved as soon as possible. As for the hijacked Xiang Sheng car, it was later found on Avenue Joffre. As of 8:00 p.m., no family member had reported to the police station, it was said.</p>
<p>Another Student Also Kidnapped</p>
<p>On the same day, a kidnapping case also occurred in the French Concession. The kidnapped person was also a student named Yang Litai, who is fifteen years old, from Fujian, and lives in a Western-style house at No. 804 Shan Zhong Road, French Concession. The house is his family's property, and his family is wealthy, which made him a target for bandits. His father was an overseas Chinese in Nanyang and passed away more than three years ago. His mother, Ms. Dong, is forty-one years old, from Yancheng. Yang is a fifth-grade student at Guba Primary School in Guba Apartment on Guba Road. He leaves early and returns late, and a maid is sent to pick him up, which is a common practice. Yesterday, at about 12:14 p.m., Yang finished class and was on his way home.</p>
<p>Forced into a Car and Speeds Away</p>
<p>His family had already sent the maid, Sun Liu (38 years old, from Jiangbei), to the school to pick him up. She accompanied him out, and they hired two rickshaws. When they arrived at the intersection of Pu Shi Road and Shan Zhong Road, a Yunfei car that had been previously hijacked by the bandits, license plate number 12323, stopped by the roadside. Seeing Yang's rickshaw approaching, three bandits jumped out, all wearing black Zhongshan suits on the upper body, yellow shorts on the lower body, and black leather shoes. Two of them pulled out pistols and threatened the rickshaw pullers and the maid. They forced Yang into the car and sped away. The maid returned home and reported the kidnapping to the mistress, who then reported it to the Shanlian Road Police Station in charge, requesting them to investigate the bandits. Later, the car was found on Avenue Kena, it was said.</p>

<p>Yong Sheng Rice Shop, located at No. 7, Lane 466, Tianjin Road, purchased white rice worth more than 48,500 yuan from Li Aidong and others and issued checks. However, the checks could not be cashed when they were due, and Yong Sheng also went bankrupt. Manager Xue Caizhang and Assistant Manager Xu Runlin both fled without a trace. Li and others hired lawyer Wu Linkun to report the case to the Lao Zha Police Station, requesting their arrest. Later, Chinese detective Guo Ruiquan arrested Xu Runlin at No. 1, Lane 163, Avenue La Dou. A savings account book of Xinxin Company with more than 2,000 yuan and 717 yuan in cash were confiscated. He was sent to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Meng Tingke continued the trial in the Fourth Criminal Court. The police lawyer, Peng Qixin, stated that there were no other developments in the case, which was being adjourned. The defendant Xu Runlin's lawyer, Qian Zheng, stated that the civil part of the case had been settled with the plaintiff, and that the Yong Sheng Rice Shop managed by the defendant was actually bankrupt due to huge losses and financial difficulties, not intentional fraud. He requested the court to grant leniency and impose a lenient sentence. After questioning by Judge Meng, Xu Runlin was sentenced to a fine of 500 yuan, or one day of labor service for every three yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Punishing Opium Use <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Hou Rensheng, a local resident, opened a Guotai Western Tailoring Shop at No. 341 Tongfu Road. He had a chartered car and hollowed out the back cushion of the car to hide opium. On April 23 this year, he put six taels of opium in the chartered car, which was ridden by his apprentice Xue Yanlin, and the car was pulled by the driver Jiang A'er. The car was inspected on Avenue Zhapu and the opium was discovered. At that time, Hou fled, and only Hou's wife, Cao, was arrested and sent to the Special Court for trial. A warrant was issued for the arrest of Hou Yousheng. Now, the Xinzha police officers arrested Hou at the intersection of Qingyun Road and Carter Road and sent him to the Special First Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, prosecuted according to law. The defendant hired lawyers Wang Yaotang and Tao Wuzhi to defend him in court. Judge Xiao sentenced Hou Yousheng to six months of imprisonment for opium use and a fine of 300 yuan. If the fine is commuted, or labor service is substituted, it will be calculated at three yuan per day.</p>
<h3 id="e80">All Sectors Deeply Mourn the Death of Shen Xingwu; Mr. Shen Vowed Loyalty to the Country and Supported the War of Resistance; A Request Has Been Submitted to the Central Government for Commendation and Bereavement <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the assassination of university professor Shen Xingwu the day before yesterday, according to the reporter's follow-up, Mr. Shen actually died for patriotism, becoming the first unfortunate person after Liu Zhanen. Before the July 7th Incident, Mr. Shen taught at Peking University and Peking Normal University in Beiping, supporting the War of Resistance with great sincerity, which was also reflected in his writings. After the July 7th Incident, Beiping fell, and the Japanese puppets listed thirteen famous patriotic figures in the education sector of Beiping to be arrested, and Mr. Shen was one of them. Seeing the imminent crisis, Mr. Shen</p>
<p>Left in a Hurry and Came to Shanghai to Temporarily Settle Down, Taking Teaching Positions in Private Shangzhong and Other Schools to Make a Living. Although life was very difficult, his belief in the inevitable victory of the War of Resistance and the inevitable success of nation-building never wavered. When teaching, he always used it to encourage students. When Chen Jicheng, the former principal of Private Shangzhong, was in office, he saw that Mr. Shen had excellent knowledge and qualifications and was deeply trusted by the students of the school. So</p>
<p>He Treated Him with Special Courtesy and Thought of Taking Him for His Own Use. When Chen showed a tendency to betray, Mr. Shen resolutely broke with him. After Chen joined the puppet organization, although the principal had been replaced, Chen was still unwilling to give up and secretly worked hard to preserve his old power. Public opinion severely criticized this. The students in the school were quite uneasy and went on strike once, demanding that the school board reorganize the administrative organization of the school to preserve the school's reputation and to protect the school's future. At the same time, the school's</p>
<p>Teachers with Pure Will</p>
<p>Also Argued that in Order to Preserve Shangzhong, the Internal Affairs of the School Must Be Simplified and Certain Forces Opposed by Society Must Be Completely Withdrawn. Mr. Shen Usually Did Not Intervene in School Affairs Except for Occasionally Expressing Support for the War of Resistance, But Because of His Prestige, He Was Highly Respected by General Teachers and They Had Very Good Feelings for Each Other. Mr. Shen Also Expressed His Approval of This View. Mr. Shen Might</p>
<p>Therefore Be Envied</p>
<p>And Ultimately Could Not Avoid Disaster. It is Said that After Mr. Shen's Death, the Teachers and Staff of the Schools Where He Worked Were Very Sad, and the Students Were Even More Grieved. They Went to His Family to Offer Condolences and Planned to Raise Funds for the Aftermath. The Education Authorities Have Also Telegraphically Requested the Central Government to Give Special Commendation and Provide Generous Bereavement to Comfort the Heroic Spirit and Reassure the Survivors. It is Said that Mr. Shen Left Behind a Wife and a Daughter, and the Family Situation Was Depressed, Which Was Very Pitiful.</p>

He was hit in the abdomen by a stray bullet and fell to the ground. The police sent him to Guangci Hospital, where the doctor performed surgery to remove the bullet and treat him. However, due to his serious injuries, the treatment was ineffective, and he died at 4 a.m. yesterday. The hospital notified the police, who transported the body to the forensic examination office of the Tongren Fuyuan Branch. Yesterday, Zhao Changmin, the prosecutor of the Special Second Court, arrived at the site to verify that the deceased died from gunshot wounds. The body was claimed by his family for burial. The murderer will be arrested and brought to justice by the police department. However, because the family was unable to afford the coffin and burial, the Tongren Fuyuan Branch provided a wooden coffin for burial at the cemetery.</p>

<p>Yesterday's discount rate for exchange-drawn notes continued to fall, and the discount rate per thousand yuan has broken into the 100 yuan mark. The fall before the summer solstice was unexpected.

<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: The Shanghai red fell, and the British and American gold pounds also fluctuated, eventually continuing to fall by three yuan. The British gold notes did not rise because of the shrinking black market British exchange rate, because generally people are unwilling to buy at high prices. The US gold notes were still selling strongly in the early morning because the British pound price in the New York market continued to be low, once retreating to 17 yuan. Later, the general sentiment that today's exchange rate would turn around slightly, so the public's need increased slightly, and finally it returned to 17.3 yuan, but still fell by 0.45 yuan compared to the previous day.

The former retreated to 1.12 yuan, and the latter fell to 0.94 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Short Positions Take Profits and Cover; The Gold Market Falls and Then Frequently Rebounds; The Low Price Was 5,530 Yuan; 300+ Yuan Was Deducted According to the US Exchange Rate Settlement Price <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot Shanghai red black market situation: It fell again following the rise in the US and British exchange rates. Because the market was still good and many people took advantage of the low prices to cover, it rebounded frequently after falling. As a result, it continued to decrease by 145 yuan. If calculated according to the US exchange rate settlement price on the day, 312 yuan was deducted. Looking at the process of the half day, it was strongly deducted by 245 yuan as soon as it opened in the morning, to 5,550 yuan. Later, the securities firms, extra numbers, and retail investors took advantage of the cheap prices to collect as much as possible, and it rose to 5,650 yuan under the buying wind. Unfortunately, the exchange rate was reported to be looser, and another gold firm and a certain bank sold together, and the market sentiment weakened again, falling to 5,530 yuan. As a result, it relied on the maintenance of the money exchange industry and closed at 5,650 yuan, a decrease of 145 yuan compared to the previous day. The market sentiment was even stronger after the close, and it continued to rebound by 40 yuan, and there were transactions at 5,690 yuan. The transaction was very active for half a day, with three thousand ingots of light. The jewelry gold in silver shops was quoted at a small increase of 10 yuan, and the customs gold remained level.</p>
<p>Shanghai Gold Fell Again by 145 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels) was initially quoted because the exchange rate continued to rise sharply by more than one jiao, and both the US exchange rate and the black market rate increased. The black market was about to approach the 6 yuan mark, so the market was very tired, and gold firms and others sold at a reduced price. First, a certain gold firm sold 10 taels to banks and other firms, which was 5,500 yuan, a sharp decrease of 245 yuan compared to the previous day. Later, the securities firms suddenly came to buy, and at the same time, a certain money exchange industry also followed suit, but at this time, a certain bank had a floating surplus from the previous day and took the opportunity to sell, so the rebound was still slow. When it rebounded to 5,600 yuan, there were fewer sellers. Soon the price rose by another 50 yuan, and the securities firms entered the gold firm with 30 taels, which was 5,650 yuan. Later, the exchange market still loosened, and it was difficult to stand firm at a high price. The gold firm took advantage of the high price to sell, and the bank still had sales, most of which were short positions. Before long, the father fell miserably by 120 yuan, and the bank sold 20 taels to the securities firms, which was 5,530 yuan. Soon after, the foreign exchange was slightly level, and a certain bank turned from selling to buying, and securities firms, retail investors, and others also bought in, and it rebounded again. When it reached 5,600 yuan, a certain money exchange industry completed its long position. Unfortunately, the securities firms had a very healthy appetite, and the gold firms also entered, and finally felt that the buying was greater than the selling, and the father rebounded to 50 yuan. The banks made each other 20 taels, which was 5,650 yuan as the closing price for noon (the market was even better after the close, and under the urgent demand of the banks, it rebounded again by 40 yuan. Finally, there were no sellers at 5,690 yuan). As a result, it decreased by 145 yuan compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 120 yuan for half a day. The selling price of the spot gold of the current gold firm was more than 10 yuan higher than that of the Shanghai Red, and the purchase price was reduced by more than 30 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few openings.</p>
<p>Silver and Jewelry Gold Were Quoted at a Small Increase of 10 Yuan</p>
<p>At the beginning, the jewelry gold per tael was still quoted at 590 yuan by Datongxing, but at 9:35 it was quoted at a small increase of 20 yuan, and at 10:30 it rebounded by a large increase of 10 yuan. There was no change after that. As a result, Datongxing changed to quote at 580 yuan, which was the same as the previous price. The purchase price was reduced by about 3 shang yuan by the new company.</p>

The foreign stock goods were 69 yuan to 69.5 yuan in the morning and 70 yuan in the afternoon, a slight increase of 0.5 to 0.7 yuan. The re-exported goods initially fell by 1.8 yuan, and then rebounded by 0.7 yuan, 55 yuan to 16 yuan in the morning and 56.5 yuan to 57.5 yuan in the afternoon. Taikoo's car white B mark was 82.5 yuan, a small increase of 0.5 yuan, and H mark car red was 59 yuan, an increase of 0.5 yuan. Dutch red was still 61 yuan. The factory's snow white was 71 yuan, No. 1 ice was 92.5 yuan, and crystal clear ice was 94 yuan, with no major changes. There were no transactions for domestic sugar. Also, yesterday 1,450 bags of sugar came from Hong Kong and were transferred to Dagu.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Cotton Yarn: Both the Bulls and the Bears Are Completing Their Positions; The Yarn Price Falls Sharply and Then Rebounds Slightly; The Lowest Price for Shuangma Was 1,060 Yuan <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market started to fall and then leveled off. In fact, it has been falling for days, and the degree of the decline is very deep, which has aroused the offset of general profit-takers. Therefore, the shocking and illusory market price suddenly rebounded. At the same time, the actual needs in South China are still not weak. As a result, new buyers and market players have become active again, but the overseas cotton industry situation is still in a state of wandering.</p>
<p>The current yarn market opened in the morning due to the continued rise in British and American exchange rates and the rise in the US exchange rate. The market sentiment continued to advance with the previous day's imaginary and floating air. The spot price of 20-count Shuangma was 1,140 yuan. Then, because there were few buyers and the long positions were painfully cut, the market plummeted to 1,060 yuan in an instant. But after the falling wind was at its peak, it aroused the offset of short positions, and it suddenly rebounded to 1,135 yuan. In fact, (Monday) the 11th is the Dragon Boat Festival, and the market is closed. For the sake of avoiding risks, loose short positions are directly carried over overnight, so the reverse movement is particularly strong. The statistics for transactions in half a day totaled 1,650 bales. Also, 53 pieces of cotton yarn came from Hong Kong yesterday, and 110 pieces are being transported to Hong Kong today. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow Traders: 1,080 Hong Kong: 490</p>
<p>Ningbo: 50 Xiamen: 30</p>
<p>Total: 1,650</p>
<h3 id="e92">The Cotton Market Remains Sluggish <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The trading of local cotton is very quiet. This is because the world is filled with war clouds, the American and Indian cotton markets are sluggish, and the yarn market is very depressed, which has led to a lack of enthusiasm. Therefore, the market is sluggish and lacks momentum.</p>
<p>In other news, the foreign cotton market price and the New York cotton market were more active in the early morning. Later, because of the purchases of spot traders and the offsets of a portion of the short positions, the market situation was firm. As a result, the closing price rose by 7-8 points compared to the previous day. The Indian market situation was very tired, and yesterday it fell by more than 3 rupees, including predictions.</p>
<p>The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai was extremely quiet in all aspects. The same industry generally held a wait-and-see attitude, so the cotton market presented a sluggish state. The factory price of yesterday's cotton market converted at a US exchange rate of 5.75 yuan is as follows:</p>
<p>20 Count American Midling 289.95</p>
<p>Also: Lower Grade 279.90</p>
<p>32 Count: Also 309.30</p>
<p>Also: Lower Grade: 2 9.50</p>
<p>42 Count: Also 323.00</p>
<p>Also: Lower Grade: 3 3.10</p>
<p>A Large Batch of American Cotton Arrived in Shanghai. The American Liner (Warrior), represented by the local Hualun Yanghang, transported 8,950 pieces of cotton from the United States this time. It arrived in Shanghai on the 7th (noon) of the day before yesterday, docked at Qichang Dock in Pudong, and began unloading yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Grains: Foreign Rice Imports Uninterrupted, Market Prices Difficult to Ease, Short-Grain Rice Nearing Sixty Yuan <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>In the past two days, the price of foreign rice has been fluctuating rapidly. Although it rose and fell somewhat stably in the morning, by the afternoon, due to changes in the gold exchange rate and the arrival of order confirmations, a decline of thirty to fifty cents was commonly seen. Yesterday morning, this kind of weak trend continued. The market opened with uncertainty, with more selling than buying. Floating traders were seen dumping prices to sell off their holdings, causing the early market price of No. 2 Saigon rice to fall to 50.05 yuan, and small-milled rice to 49.80 yuan. It wasn't until midday that small rice shops, due to their traditionally weak financial positions, and as the Dragon Boat Festival ended, prepared for the upcoming two-day closure to meet demand, and aggressively entered the market at low prices, that retail sales gradually became active. Subsequently, large-scale purchases by inland rural clients occurred, and floating traders reversed course, buying back in, tightening the situation.</p>
<p>The price of foreign rice yesterday fluctuated inconsistently. In the morning, with the US dollar exchange rate lengthening, buying interest was weak, and many merchants and hoarders sold off their holdings, causing the market to gradually decline by sixty or seventy cents to nearly one yuan. Soon, local merchants took advantage of the low prices to buy, and rumors spread that shipping from Southeast Asia was unreliable, and that prices for Siamese and other origins remained high. Continued orders were not finalized, and the market was subject to competitive buying from various parties, causing prices to rise steadily. For example, small-milled rice, which fell to 49.80 or 49.90 yuan in the early market, recovered to 51.20 yuan at noon, and once rose to 52 yuan in the afternoon, closing at 51.80 yuan in the evening. Although selling prices varied between Western warehouses in Pudong and bank warehouses (Pudong and Puxi differed by one or two jiao, and bank warehouses were one or two jiao more expensive), market prices fluctuated by about two yuan, which was still fifty or sixty cents to nearly one yuan higher than the evening close of the previous day. The forward price for No. 2 Siamese rice for delivery in June was quoted at over one hundred tons, with prices ranging from 59 to 59.10 yuan. Currently, there are 7,000 bags of foreign rice.</p>
<p>According to another report, a large quantity of foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson's "Tuck Sang" arrived in Shanghai, carrying 17,252 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, docking at the Roosevelt Wharf in the French Concession for unloading. Another 595 bags were transferred to Tianjin.</p>
<p>For thick and thin short-grain domestic rice, over 1,000 bags of short-grain rice arrived yesterday via inland ships, but early and late season rice crops continued to be scarce at port. Rumors circulated of off-market transactions, as early and late rice crops were selling well, and holders were firm in their intentions. The situation for short-grain rice was quite different, so selling prices varied. The listed price for old-crop Changbang special high-quality short-grain rice was still 58 or 59 yuan, Chang Kun short-grain rice was 57 or 58 yuan, old stock was around 56 yuan, Qing Si thin rice was 57 yuan, and South Port early rice was 56.23 to 56 yuan, about half a yuan higher.</p>
<p>No glutinous rice arrived yesterday, and the peak selling season has passed, so the market turned quiet, with supply and demand balanced and prices remaining stable. Kaijin Li Special Yuan rice remained at 46 or 47 yuan, Chang Dan White Yuan rice was 45 or 46 yuan, and Jiangbei White Yuan rice was 43 or 44 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Japanese Monopolization Continues, Wheat and Flour Also in Difficulty <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, being a weekend, the flour market showed no special changes. The price for No. 2 flour mill remained at 13.80 yuan. Due to the holiday, retail transactions in this street were slightly more active, with factories selling about 7,000 bags. Inland flour and recycled flour from old vehicles had buyers but no sellers. Sales to both northern and southern merchants were irregular due to varying customer prices, and no formal transactions took place. At this time, with the supply of new wheat not forthcoming, the future price of flour is in a dilemma, and remains in a stalemate.</p>
<p>Wheat: There were no wheat transactions reported yesterday. However, recently, Japanese factories, taking advantage of the difficulties faced by Chinese merchants in transportation, are actively purchasing wheat from various producing areas at prices of 22 or 23 yuan. Therefore, there have been sporadic private shipments to Shanghai from certain quarters in recent days, but this has not yet been confirmed. Under the controlling force of this special situation, Chinese factories can only patiently await any future surplus. It is reported that the shipment of new wheat from various regions is gradually increasing, and the transportation problem may soon be resolved, but it is unknown how much the future costs and miscellaneous expenses will increase.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Securities: Public Bonds Mostly Liquidated <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>In the over-the-counter securities market, the ninth drawing for Type E bonds was held yesterday. The market price, calculated after deducting the value of the winning tickets, was down by eight and a half jiao, now on par with the price of Type C bonds. Most other bonds were slightly softer due to the Dragon Boat Festival holiday, with many investors looking to close out positions.</p>
<p>Bullish positions were slightly liquidated, showing some weakness, but Type D bonds were uniquely up by one jiao as its market price was still one yuan lower than Type C and E bonds. The trend was stable, and trading in the market was still quite lively. Runli, Hongda, and Jiufeng were all bought, either to cover short positions or to increase holdings, but Renchang, Lianyi, and general retail investors sold more actively, causing the market price to fall from high to low. Trading ceased in the afternoon to settle same-day transactions. Half-day turnover was about 400,000 yuan. Prices were slightly better for Type D bonds by one jiao, while others were down by five cents to two jiao, and Type E bonds were down by eight and a half jiao. A brief summary is listed below:</p>
<p>In stock trading, 50 shares of the Silk Industry Bank were traded at a price of 27.5 yuan. Today is the regular Sunday holiday, and there will be an additional holiday on Monday for the Dragon Boat Festival. Trading will resume as usual on Tuesday.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Oil Market: Japanese Manipulation Causes Sharp Rise in Rapeseed and Soybean Oil Prices, When Will Life's Suffering Ease? <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Recently, fluctuations in the oil market have been erratic, entirely due to manipulation. In the past two days, prices have suddenly soared because domestic rapeseed oil is controlled by Japanese merchants, and prices are rising daily. It is reported that the price of rapeseed oil has reached 86 or 87 yuan per dan, leading to a corresponding rise in soybean oil, which had been sluggish. The bullish trend intensified yesterday, as oil merchants and hoarders have secretly transported their goods to inland areas, causing a shortage of supplies in the open market, fueling market sentiment. As a result, market prices surged by three or four yuan compared to the previous day. Total transaction volume was 200 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, with prices opening at 102 yuan, rising to 104 yuan, and closing at 103.5 yuan. Ninety barrels of Bengbu soybean oil were traded at prices ranging from 96 yuan to 100 yuan. Two hundred pieces of Yantai oil were priced at 72.5 yuan, 200 pieces of Qingqi oil at 71 yuan, 300 pieces of Jiaozhou oil at 70 yuan, and 500 dan of Dayou factory oil at prices ranging from 79 yuan to 80 yuan. Although peanut oil showed tightness, due to different sales channels, the trend was normal. Fifty pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded at 73.5 yuan, 100 pieces of Yantai oil at 73 yuan, 1,000 cans of another oil at 95 yuan, and 80 barrels of Qingdao oil at prices ranging from 103 yuan to 104.5 yuan. (On the 10th, the Dragon Boat Festival, there was no trading in the miscellaneous grains, oil and oilcake market).</p>
<h3 id="e98">Silk and Tea: Western Firms' Silk Market Declines <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Due to the sharp decline in actual silk sales in New York in May, overseas silk prices are entering a weak period. In this city, the recent continuous increase in foreign exchange rates has invisibly caused silk prices to fall. Currently, Western firms are offering prices in the range of 4,900-5,000 yuan, but silk factories remain firm in their intentions, so there have been no transactions.</p>
<p>Two hundred and sixty-five pieces of tea arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Textiles: New Shipments of Black Cotton Interlining Available <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Black cotton interlining has been out of stock for over twenty days, and its exorbitant price has made it difficult to find. This is unprecedented in the textile industry. Tailors who urgently need it have had to purchase small quantities from Yuanchangxing, Huayang, Dechang, and Zhangxiangtai, etc., at higher prices. Buyers are eager for the goods, like rain after a long drought. Due to the high price and scarcity, a substitute made of all-yarn woven imitation black cotton interlining has emerged, but its quality is too poor to replace the real thing. Recently, Yinfengxinji Factory in Pentang Lane has started producing genuine wool-woven black cotton interlining. Due to the high price and scarcity of raw wool, production costs are significantly higher, causing its selling price to skyrocket and not be cheap. Yesterday, several dozen pieces were sold at 4.25 yuan. According to the manager of the factory, Mr. Guo, a large quantity of black wool yarn was purchased last week, enough to supply the city's needs for several months. Half of it is being sold off now, and the other half will be held for future spot sales, with an asking price of 4.4 yuan. Also, 81 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Chinese Clothing Fabric Sales Sluggish, Prices Stable <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The prices of woolen fabrics and serge for Chinese-style clothing have been quite high on the wholesale market recently. Therefore, most retail stores have raised their prices. Currently, retail stores selling Chinese-style clothing fabrics are asking at least 3 yuan per foot for any fabric, and 5 or 6 yuan per foot for something slightly better. High-quality all-wool fabrics made in England cost 8 or 9 yuan per foot, an average increase of 20-30% compared to before May 2. Compared to last year's market price, prices have risen by an average of 200%. As a result, actual sales have been sluggish because the cost of living on the isolated island is high, naturally reducing purchasing power, causing the market for various poplins and gown fabrics to become stable.</p>

<p>The market inventory of glutinous rice branches has become increasingly scarce, nearing a complete shortage. It is reported that high-quality goods have reached 400 yuan, an increase of 60-70 yuan compared to before. Other mixed-quality goods have also seen a slight increase, but not by much.</p>

<p>After soaring prices in the black iron billet market, sales in various channels became sluggish. However, since recently, due to the weakening of foreign exchange rates and sharp drop in cash values, the prices of various goods have generally decreased, and black iron billets are no exception. The market has softened, with the current price at 1,200 yuan per case (2,000 pounds), although an asking price of 1,250 yuan is sometimes seen. Yesterday, transactions were made with local hot water bottle factories, printing factories, and mirror factories. Merchants from other regions, such as Tianjin and Yantai, also occasionally seek to acquire them. It is reported that the circulation of goods in the current market is still small, and there is no supply and demand imbalance for the time being.</p>

<p>Huisi iron trading was quite lively yesterday and the day before, with local can factories making large purchases, and merchants from Yantai and Qingdao also buying actively, boosting market sentiment. The price has not weakened due to the foreign exchange rate, and remains high. Old steel factories are selling at 220 yuan, and new steel factories at 200 yuan. Yesterday's total transaction volume reached over 300 cases.</p>

<h3 id="e104">The Main Force of Modern Warfare - Public Morale <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The first phase of the Sino-Japanese War in Europe has just ended, and the second phase has already begun. News from the front lines fills the newspapers, almost too much to keep up with. In fact, in modern total war, the situation in the rear of the belligerent countries also has a great impact on the future of the war. The New York Times correspondent, Xin Yi, specially investigated public morale in the rear of England, France, and Germany, and wrote a thorough analysis, which our reporter, Zi Hua, translates here for reference.</p>
<p>The rear situations of the belligerent countries of England, France, and Germany have been separated from the front lines for several months. The only direct communication is through bombs in the air and wireless broadcasts. News brought from Berlin to London by people who actually observed the situation there is eagerly sought after, even if it is just a small detail. Even the slightest sound coming from England is being listened to intently by those in Berlin.</p>
<p>Relatively speaking, only the French do not have this kind of curiosity. They only keep their eyes fixed on London, just as nervously as London and Berlin are monitoring each other. However, they live next door to Germany, and the war is right at their doorstep, so in their spare time, they would rather talk about things other than the enemy country. They do not value the internal situation of Germany as much as the British do. They have never harbored the illusion that Germany will collapse on its own.</p>
<p>The Americans still wanted to be clever two months ago, and still wanted to avoid fighting to the death. In the months of waiting before the major battle on the Western Front, they never stopped stepping up their preparations for war, but at the same time, they were foolishly dreaming of two things to escape the terror of large-scale war and bombing.</p>
<p>First, they wanted to use their great naval power and financial resources to intensify the blockade and suffocate the enemy. When an informed foreigner in London saw the formerly elegant old gentlemen transformed into John Bulls ready for battle, not only full of energy but also with a reserved strength to continue their efforts, he couldn't help but exclaim that, fighting like this, Britain would have enough strength to support another long war.</p>
<p>France, however, is more strained, and its unity is not very firm. Although its army is larger than Germany's and its training is also very refined, its manpower is small. The soldiers that Hitler relies on are mostly young men. These young people are full of vigor and easily indoctrinated and driven. The old party members are not as enthusiastic as these newcomers.</p>
<p>The second thing is that Britain expects internal changes in Germany. The French call it an illusion. Most Germans are tired of war. Like the French, they complain, "Two wars in one lifetime are more than enough." But the British forget that war itself is a melting force. Whether they are Nazi Party members or anti-Nazi Party members, they are all Germans now, just as determined as the British and French to fight to the end.</p>
<p>Hitler's successive victories, although achieved by recklessly invading one small and weak nation after another, have not weakened his power. Although the undercurrents of opposition within Germany cannot be concealed by superficial unity, this counter-current rarely involves moral indignation.</p>
<p>The Nazi Party's past mistreatment of Jews aroused a sense of shame and disgust among the German intelligentsia, but there was no public outrage. Since then, the German people have gradually become accustomed to cruelty; they were even unmoved by the tragic fate of the Polish people. Although anti-Nazi factions have condemned this aggression, their motive is not for the trampling of neighboring peoples, but because Hitler miscalculated and dragged them into the vortex of war.</p>
<p>Britain no longer expects internal changes in Germany. But thinking long-term, expecting Germany to collapse not in economic or military terms, but in moral terms, may not be an illusion after all.</p>
<p>This conflict can be said to be a combination of many wars in one. By observing from different angles and from the standpoint of more than a dozen countries, it is not difficult to grasp the meaning of this decisive war. This decisive war can be said to be a major turning point in human history. Caught in the great waves of Europe, one can feel that this war is only one aspect of a major upheaval. After the outcome is decided, how arduous it will be for the victorious countries to rebuild Europe.</p>
<p>So, where does the decisive force lie? It lies in public morale and its ability to endure. After observing the rear of both belligerent countries, the author deeply believes that the key to victory or defeat in this decisive war lies in moral strength.</p>
<p>The last European war was only a transitional war. Although the weapons used were new, its thinking was still based on the old tune of previous wars. This decisive war can be said to be the first truly modern war, in which not only the army but the entire nation is fighting. The people in the rear are not only mobilized, their food is restricted more severely than that of the soldiers, their daily working hours are longer, and the dangers are greater. Therefore, public morale is naturally more important to the victory or defeat of modern warfare than military morale.</p>
<p>This kind of tempering of public morale is in full swing. Before the start of the major battle on the Western Front, Germany's fighting spirit was about the same as that of England and France. It was neither enthusiastic nor did it have any flaws. The patriotism shown in previous wartime was the most indifferent in this decisive war. When the army set off, there was no cheering or military music, which in turn proves the solemnity of this war.</p>
<p>At the start of the war, the Germans were even more tired than their enemies, as if they had lost their elasticity. They are stronger than others at enduring hardships. They have a genius for creating something out of nothing. It would be wrong to think that they would not fight to the end. Nazism has distorted their minds and strained their nerves, but Germany is still a force to be reckoned with, capable of fighting at all costs. But its fighting power is indeed limited, and this limitation lies not only in material resources but also in reserve forces. France is fighting this decisive war out of necessity. "We've had enough," "We must end it," is France's only war slogan.</p>
<p>The British, however, have the most morale. This may be because the British rear has not yet felt the suffering of the Germans, or because their daily life is not as chaotic as that of French metropolitan areas and small towns. But the British are more down-to-earth. Every Englishman knows what war is in his heart, and believes in how devastating war will be. They are prepared to be bombed, prepared to be exhausted after years of war, and in the end, they will sacrifice everything. But their souls cannot be lost.</p>
<p>Young French soldiers know that they are fighting for Christian civilization. The number of priests and pastors accompanying the French army has increased significantly. The British, young and old, believe that this decisive event is a battle between good and evil, with clear banners and no room for compromise. From Lord Halifax to the chauffeur, they all speak eloquently that this decisive event is a battle between the spirit of mankind and the forces of matter, and there is no reason to give up halfway.</p>
<p>The English and French have different psychologies, but their will to fight is the same. They are not only fighting to maintain their power and territory, but also to maintain the spiritual heritage, that is, for their souls.</p>
<p>The German mobilization was initiated by Hitler's will. He is indeed sufficient to represent the will of the nation to a certain extent, but to a certain extent, the German people have no right to choose. They are fighting for aggression, not for conservation. Aggression inevitably sacrifices others, and their position becomes that of the unjust who receive little help. Nazi Germany has absolutely no spiritual strength. This iron in the soul may become a fatal blow.</p>
<h3 id="e105">The Significance of the Battle of Narvik <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>—伯明</p>
<p>The Norwegian coastline is 1,600 miles long, which is neither easy to protect nor easy to block. The port of Narvik in northern Norway is the only good port in Northern Europe that does not freeze all year round. Most of Sweden's iron sand is exported from this port. Since Germany lost its iron production supply from the Lorraine region of France, it naturally has to rely entirely on Sweden. Germany buys a total of 10 million tons of iron sand from Sweden every year. In the first six months since the start of the war, Germany obtained a total of 640,000 tons of iron sand from the port of Narvik, accounting for a quarter of the same period last year. In addition to Narvik, iron sand can of course also be obtained from ports in the Baltic Sea, but the Baltic ports are only open for seven months each year. Germany can obtain about 8 million tons of iron sand from these ports.</p>
<p>However, the iron content of each ton of iron sand is different. The iron sand exported from the port of Narvik is all Kiruna sand from northern Sweden, with an iron content of 60 to 65 percent. The iron content of iron sand from the Gällivare area and central and southern Sweden averages no more than 40 percent. Therefore, Germany needs to import 1,500 tons of iron sand from Gällivare and other places to equal 1,000 tons of Kiruna sand. Moreover, many German steel mills can only use Kiruna high-grade iron sand. The Swedish government holds half of the shares of the Kiruna mine and restricts the mine's annual output to 8 million tons. The iron sand shipped from the port of Luleå in the Baltic Sea is mostly produced in the Malmberget area near Gällivare. The problem that Germany needs to solve is whether the Kiruna sand can be transported to Luleå in the southeast instead of to Narvik in the northwest. But there are many obstacles. First, the distance from Kiruna to Luleå is twice as long as the distance from Kiruna to Narvik. If the original amount of sand is to be maintained, more railway cars must be added. The Swedish government is adding coal cars, which are expected to be delivered by the end of this year. Second, the Kiruna sand is transported down the mountain to Narvik. It can be crushed and mixed at the foot of the mountain and then poured into the ship. If it is transported to Luleå, most of the journey can also be transported down the mountain, but it must be taken out and loaded onto the ship. Third, the sand transported from Gällivare to Luleå is rolled and inspected in Gällivare, and Luleå does not have a sand rolling machine. According to Germany's plan, Luleå must install this expensive hard steel sand rolling machine, otherwise Germany can only transport the raw iron sand back to Germany from Luleå for crushing, but the amount of raw iron sand decreases after it is crushed.</p>
<p>Therefore, Germany attaches great importance to the issue of transporting sand from the port of Narvik. If German ships cannot reach Narvik, Germany will not be in a desperate situation, but it will definitely be in a more unfavorable position.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Comparison of British and German Air Forces <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— 霖</p>
<p>The German High Command summed up the first phase of the war on the Western Front by saying that the success of the German army on the Western Front was due to the superiority of the German Air Force. The German authorities obtained all information about the enemy's activities from it, and destroyed the enemy's navy and hit the enemy's morale. The greatness of its victory can be seen from the enemy's losses.</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Churchill reported to Parliament that the Battle of Dunkirk was a great test of the strength of the air forces of Britain and Germany. At that time, there were thousands of ships along the coast, and more than 300,000 troops were evacuated from the beaches. Could there be a greater target for the German Air Force than this? Could there be greater military importance than this? The German aircraft repeatedly attacked, but were repelled. Our army completed the evacuation, and the enemy suffered four times as many losses as we did. The German large aircraft squadrons launched a decisive attack on our aircraft squadrons, which were only a quarter of their size, but our aircraft almost repelled them. The power of our country's various types of aircraft and pilots is far greater than that of the enemy.</p>
<p>American Army Major Seversky also published an article in the New York Times, saying that the success of the British evacuation of Dunkirk was due to its fighter planes. From the perspective of those with aviation experience, it is indeed credible. Because British aircraft such as "Spitfire", "Hurricane", and "Defiant" are all the best of the fighter planes. They can be said to be invincible in the skies above the English Channel. If the British Air Force did not have this kind of superior strength, then this evacuation would have inevitably suffered great losses. The long duration of the battle between the British and German air forces, and the fact that it was a matter of life and death, actually started with this. Due to the cover of the fighter planes, it was very difficult for the enemy to bomb Dunkirk, and the evacuation of the British troops was a great success.</p>
<p>The words of the British and German authorities and neutral observers are like this. Now, I will translate and record the comparison made by the Manchester Guardian as follows:</p>
<p>The aviation squadron in the German army is different from the British Air Force, which is an independent army. Its development, like bamboo shoots after rain, only began in 1932, when Hitler appointed Goering as Minister of Aviation. For this reason, there is often a shortage of experienced staff officers and various instructors. However, for eight years, working hard, the German Air Force has become a strong force that cannot be taken lightly. The entire industry is mobilized to serve the Air Force. Aircraft manufacturing plants are concentrated in the eastern part of the country, so that they can be far away from air raids from the French side. All factory designs aim at rapid production, concealment, and comfortable employees. No matter how much money is spent, it is not spared. Initially, this work was carried out secretly, and by September 1935, the results were great, and the 24 squadrons of the Air Force had begun to show their prowess. Junkers and Heinkel 111 bombers also appeared at the same time. By 1937, Heinkel and Messerschmitt 109 fighters appeared in large numbers.</p>
<p>When Goering was planning, there were dozens of problems that needed to be solved urgently. What he longed for was mass production, so he had to first decide what kind of tasks the German Air Force would undertake in combat. The decision was to select several types of aircraft as the standards for specialized manufacturing in the future. Because any type of aircraft, once selected as a standard for mass manufacturing in various factories, is not easy to stop manufacturing and replace with other types. What Goering decided seems to be to let the Air Force assist the Army in combat, rather than letting it stand alone.</p>
<p>The German Air Force and land mechanized units complemented each other in the invasion of Poland. This was the way of combat that Goering idealizes. In terms of its training methods and standard styles, the German side had no idea of ​​starting a war with Britain at the time. Because this training method and the type of aircraft it selected do not allow for crossing the North Sea or large-scale air raids. The standard aircraft selected by Germany for mass manufacturing are the Heinkel 111 bomber and the Messerschmitt 109 fighter. The latter began mass manufacturing in 1935. At that time, this type of aircraft was actually the leader among fighter planes in the world. The only thing missing was a reliable 1,000-horsepower engine. After several improvements, it gradually expanded its motor power. However, due to the expansion of the engine, it seemed to lack agility in operation. The weapons installed are either four machine guns or two cannons. State cannot install both on one aircraft at the same time. It seems that the decision on which weapons to install will be made by the Air Force commander. The German theory seems to be that the only task of fighter planes is to destroy bombers, and as for engaging enemy fighter planes, it is still a minor matter.</p>
<p>The Heinkel 111 bomber was also a good choice when it began mass manufacturing. Its design was ahead of the British Blenheim aircraft, and its speed was also greater than that of the British elite Fury aircraft. Before the Spanish Civil War, the German side had an erroneous theory about the design of bombers, believing that bombers must have a large loading capacity (a large number of bombs or a large amount of gasoline, depending on the situation) and speed. Heavy weapons are regarded as not essential, because bombers can always escape when encountering enemy fighter planes. Therefore, the Heinkel aircraft only has one machine gun in the front and two in the back, each installed under the fuel tank. In order to increase the speed, it is impossible to install a turret on the long and narrow fuel tank. This is the advantage of British aircraft, which cannot be imitated by the German side for a while.</p>
<p>British Hurricane and Spitfire aircraft have extremely high speeds and are equipped with eight machine guns. Since their appearance, they have overturned the calculations on which the Messerschmitt 109 and Heinkel 21 aircraft were designed. The turrets installed on British heavy bombers make it even more difficult for German Air Force personnel to deal with.</p>
<p>Goering also considered the replenishment of new aircraft. The new fighter Messerschmitt 110 and the new bomber Junkers 88 have recently emerged. The Messerschmitt 110 is a twin-engine, two-seater aircraft equipped with two machine guns and two cannons in the front and two machine guns in the rear. The maximum speed is 350 miles per hour, which can still cover the bombers to fly to the British coast. But if you have to turn on the throttle to fight back, then its fuel will easily run out, and flying back is difficult. The Messerschmitt 110 aircraft is also unable to bomb bomber groups. Because the combat power of the turrets on British aircraft is not easy to deal with.</p>
<p>The new bomber Junkers 88 was produced in 1938. Similar to the earliest Junkers aircraft, it also focuses on speed and loading capacity, while firepower is secondary. It has one machine gun in the front and two in the back, and no steel armor equipment. The weight of this protective steel plate has been taken up by the bomb loading capacity. Its maximum speed is 300 miles per hour, which is conducive to diving and throwing bombs. But if it encounters British fighter planes, it is as easy to destroy as the Heinkel 111 aircraft. If six Junkers 88 aircraft encounter a Sunderland flying boat, they will be unable to deal with it.</p>
<p>In addition, Germany also has the Dornier 17 aircraft. This aircraft should be called a reconnaissance aircraft rather than a bomber. The Dornier factory is now working hard to manufacture the Dornier 18 flying boat. This type of flying boat has been willing to install magnetic mines. The Heinkel 115 seaplane has also been used for this purpose.</p>
<p>The German flying squadron has great mobility. There are no less than 500 airfields in the country, so bomber squadrons of various colors can fly from one place to another at any time. This is its only advantage.</p>

<p>Gurkha, also written as Kurka, was originally called Nepal, also called Nipal, also called Nibola, also called Palerbu, also called Barbu, or simply called Bu. The various names are due to repeated translations and errors, which is not surprising. Gurkha is the name of its separate city, located on a thoroughfare, and the most prosperous in trade. It is famous for this, just like the Western Regions' Kokand is known as Andijan. The Tibetan Zhi states that it is ten days' journey from the Sel area of ​​Rear Tibet, and it belongs to the border of Bai Mu Rong. Its land is called Little Western Heaven, connected to Zhuba in the east, to the Great Western Heaven Wupenzi in the south, to Baibu in the west, and to Rear Tibet in the north. It also says: From Mu Rong to the west for ten days, it meets the border of the Great Western Heaven, and after another ten days, it reaches the place of Prince Bu'er Ya of Little Western Heaven. According to the Western Guoyu Tu, Bai Mu Rong is Bai Bu, which is Gurkha. What it calls Pen Wuzi is the Wuxiekuai of Gurkha's South Guo. What it calls Bu'er Ya is Bengal in India. Tibet and India are bounded by snow mountains. The northern border of Gurkha is close to the snow mountains. The valleys are winding and deep, and the peaks and ridges are steep, reaching the sky, with snow all year round. Now, going west from Sichuan and Yunnan to Wusi Zang, going through all the Tibetan territory, crossing the iron chain bridge of Jilong, and then going west is Gurkha. The terrain is narrow and long, thousands of miles east-west, and more than a thousand miles north-south. Its capital is called Yangbu, also called Kathmandu, also written as Kapman. The land is fertile, producing wheat, millet, beans, soybeans, sugarcane, cotton, Dan Shen, nutmeg, etc.</p>

<p>The gods have no plans for the improvement of mankind. People who believe in cults would never think that human life can be made happier and more resilient. Their golden age has passed, their great achievements have been completed, and their best hope is to imitate the past. The teachings of cults say that human life is empty, human nature cannot be changed, and the world is cold and loveless. In a society that believes in cults, there is no ideal of progress, and its philosophy is pessimistic. Pessimistic news is still very common today. Although there has been great progress in improving life, in discovery, invention, and scientific acquisition, all parties still hold a dim view of the future of culture. I think the biggest reason is because of this thing, that is, in the past twenty-five years, many of our great hopes have failed. The previous World War shook the basic structure of world life and proved to be a great disaster in human history. After the war, there were international efforts to seek peace. At this time, there were many dangers, such as many dangerous areas, excessive taxes, heavy international debts, and countless people who became crippled due to the war, all of whom needed care and treatment. In addition, people also began to discover the corruption of their governments and the practice of taking from one place to make up for another. They lost confidence in this weak international peace organization, and they suffered from an unprecedented economic depression in history. Due to unemployment, no income, and crime, the prevalence increased. The worst thing is that the Christian Church has become a kind of disappointment to many people. The church is divided into many factions, and it has no unified appeal on any issue in the world. Many sects are busy with the struggle between the new and the old, while civilians are begging for work opportunities in groups on the streets, but they ignore them. Because of all these situations, a natural pessimism has been produced, and today, no matter where you go, you can see evidence of this pessimism.</p>

<p>Little friends, time flies quickly, and in a blink of an eye, summer vacation is approaching again. Perhaps you are a sixth-grade student, and in that case, you must be worried about the issue of advancing to the next school level. Little friends! If you want to advance to the next school level, you should prepare early. First, ask your teachers to hold mock advancement exams as much as possible, with all procedures following the real advancement exams. This is because it can give you experience and prevent stage fright. Second, do more composition exercises for advancement exams, such as "My Alma Mater," "My Educational Experience," "Motivation for Applying to This School," etc., as these are common test questions in general schools. Third, practice arithmetic operations, fractions, and percentage application problems extensively, so that you can apply them freely. Fourth, choose and purchase reference books for reviewing general knowledge, and read the important parts several times. If you can prepare in this way, then you will be largely confident in the three subjects of composition, arithmetic, and general knowledge. Your preparation for advancement can be considered complete. This only addresses the issue of preparation. Shanghai has a multitude of schools, and it is impossible to know their quality from the outside. Deciding where to go requires some consideration. Therefore, it is crucial to study the methods of choosing a school. In summary, there are generally these points: the school should have a long history, a good campus, rigorous coursework, excellent teachers, and the principal must be an education expert. Only those that meet the above conditions are good schools and worthy of your application. Of course, you yourself may not know which middle school is qualified. In that case, you can consult your teachers, your parents, your relatives, and your graduating classmates. Don't make a decision casually, or be tempted by easy admission without considering it carefully, and rashly apply. As a result, the school may not be good, leading to withdrawal halfway through, which not only harms your studies but is also very uneconomical in terms of time.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to talk about the points to pay attention to during the exam. First, be calm and unhurried, so as not to discount the arithmetic formulas and general knowledge you have memorized due to panic. Second, write neatly and avoid arbitrary revisions, so as not to fill the paper with scribbles, giving the graders a bad impression. Third, if you encounter a problem that you cannot solve immediately, put it aside temporarily and do the ones you can do first, and then think about the unsolvable problems last. The worst thing is to stop and try desperately to think about a difficult problem, but time passes quickly and does not allow you to hesitate. Fourth, don't rush to hand in the paper. Know that being the first to hand in the paper is not a great honor. Rushing to hand in the paper inevitably leads to carelessness and mistakes, fulfilling the saying, "Haste makes waste." Fifth, after finishing the test paper, don't hand it in immediately. You should carefully read it from beginning to end again, correct all the errors, and hand it in only after you are confident that there are no mistakes. Although the above points are all clichés, perhaps some children are tired of hearing them, but I believe that not many can do it! , If you can follow my words, then you will definitely not fail. Victory belongs to you!</p>

<p>Time passes so quickly, and tomorrow is the Dragon Boat Festival again. In the past, people in society were very interested in the Dragon Boat Festival, and there were many allusions that could be talked about. Little brothers and sisters, on this auspicious day, there is eating and playing, and they are happy! But now it is not a time of peace. We should not just seek pleasure. In this country where the disaster is deep, our little brothers and sisters also bear a part of the responsibility. Our country needs to win , although it depends on the loyal and brave soldiers on the front line, but we in the rear must be firm and serious, or help to do relief work, etc., to fulfill our duties to the country. On this festival, I remember the loyal and patriotic sage Qu Daifu (Yuan), who died for his country on this auspicious day! Let me write his deeds and tell our children.</p>
<p>According to the Ci Yuan: (Qu Yuan, a Chu person during the Warring States period, named Ping, alias Ling Jun, served as the Sanlü Daifu in Chu. King Huai valued his talent, but Jin Shang and others slandered and alienated him, so he wrote Lisao in the hope that the king would realize. During the reign of King Xiang, he was reused and demoted to Jiangnan. He wrote Yu Fu and other articles to express his ambition, and died by throwing himself into the Miluo River on May 5th. From this, we can see that Qu Daifu was not only a great writer, but also a minister loyal to his country. It is a pity that the foolish king at that time used slander and did not value him. He was demoted to Jiangnan, so he died in the river with his ambition, accompanied by the river gods. How can we not feel sorry for him! Therefore, later generations throw zongzi into the river on this day to worship him, to express their remembrance.</p>
<p>As for his throwing himself into the river out of righteous indignation, it seems to be a passive act in today's view, but at that time, the foolish king was unreasonable. There was no other way but to jump into the river and die to admonish him. However, his loyalty to the country is obvious and worthy of respect! Little brothers and sisters, in this time of national crisis, we should stand up quickly, unite sincerely, and serve the country in the possible range.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Talking About Bathing <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhusun</p>
<p>The sun has softened the asphalt on the road, and pedestrians are constantly wiping the sweat from their foreheads with towels. The weather is really hot!</p>
<p>When children think of summer, they think of bathing. Children! Do you know the benefits of bathing? I will write a few benefits below. After you read them, think about whether they are correct or not?</p>
<p>(1) Cleanses the skin Every day, our bodies excrete sweat and other liquids from the sweat pores, as well as waste products after metabolism. Over time, these dirt emits an unpleasant odor, making others want to stay away from you. Not only that, these dirt can stop the breathing function of the pores, making people feel stuffy. The best way to remove these dirt is to bathe every day.</p>
<p>(2) Stimulates the skin The inner layer of human skin has many muscles, and these muscles contain many blood vessels of various sizes. These many muscles and blood vessels should be given the opportunity to contact and exercise with the outside world. Summer is of course not to be discussed, but in winter, except for the hands and face, there are few opportunities to contact the outside world. If we can bathe often, it is equivalent to giving the skin a chance to exercise often.</p>
<p>(3) Avoids colds Bathing every day (preferably with cold water) can make us less prone to colds. Because bathing can train the skin to adapt to sudden changes in the environment. People who do not bathe are easily invaded by bacteria when they encounter uneven hot and cold environments, which can cause colds.</p>
<p>(4) Bathing can cultivate the virtue of diligence People who bathe often must be diligent and energetic people. Observe Westerners. They love cleanliness and bathe every day regardless of the heat or cold. Therefore, they are very energetic in everything they do and are very diligent.</p>
<p>Children all know the benefits of bathing. But what should children who do not have sufficient financial resources to have bathing facilities do? I hope that they will at least wipe their bodies with cold water towels vigorously once or twice a day. This also has some of the effects of bathing.</p>

<p>— Min</p>
<p>I can't remember the various things in the dance school before. I entered the school in 1932, which can be said to be a very, very long time ago. Everything I have experienced since then is really too much. Whether it is my mother, father, two brothers, or the teachers in the dance school, they all feel it is beyond their expectations. Even I myself feel it is very fun and unbelievable. Sometimes I always secretly think, this is probably not Shirley Temple herself, but another little girl.</p>
<p>But there was a date that I remember very clearly. This is the most important date in my life. Everyone who knows me is saying that if it weren't for that day, there wouldn't be this day today. I would never work in such a large film company, I would never occupy a flat house alone on the set, I would never meet so many movie stars, and I would never receive letters and gifts from men, women, and children all over the world. Maybe I am just an ordinary little girl preparing to go to school to study.</p>
<p>That was in the early summer season. My third birthday was on April 23, 1932, and the banquet had already passed. On this day, my mother and I were about to walk out of the dance school when we saw a large hall, where many mothers were waiting with their daughters. When we looked at it, we knew that something unusual must have happened, because the children were all wearing the most beautiful clothes, and even their mothers were dressed neatly. My mother stepped forward and asked a lady what was going on. When the lady saw my mother, she seemed very surprised that she didn't know about it. Then she said, "Oh, don't you know? The Educational Film Company has sent a director here to select twenty-five children, because they want to make some short films about children. The children's ages are stipulated between two and four years old, and their height cannot exceed thirty-six inches, with one yard being the maximum. Isn't Shirley's age and height just right for these conditions? Why don't you let her stay here to see if she has a chance to be selected?"</p>
<p>My mother did not hesitate to say "no", and did not want me to stay here. She said that because I did not change into better clothes, how could I meet the director? It turned out that I was still wearing that simple and old dance dress.</p>
<p>The lady hurriedly said, "This is a pity. You should know that this is a good opportunity to step into the set. If you want to find such an opportunity again, you may have to wait a long, long time." My mother ignored her and walked away with me. I knew that she was hesitating in her heart, whether to go back or stay? So she took a few steps and stopped again, and then took a few steps forward. I knew that although my father did not approve of me entering the film industry, my mother was very interested in it. Finally, she stopped again and said to me, "Never mind, you stay and let them see you, it doesn't matter even if you are wearing old clothes." So my mother returned to the place where everyone was gathered. I remember a lady said to my mother, "Mrs. Temple, do you know that this film company has posted advertisements in the newspapers to recruit children to act? It is said that they have already auditioned five children." My mother hurriedly said, "I think they are going to select children who have experience on the screen. As for my Shirley, you know that she can't act. Even dancing is still in the early stages."</p>

<p>— Xiao Tian</p>
<p>Since the Yi Feng Troupe performed Dong Xiaowan, the Zhonglü Theater Troupe performed Ge Nenniang, and Xin Yanqiu performed Yujing Daoren, the talented people and courtesans of the late Ming Dynasty seem to have attracted people's attention again. I unintentionally flipped through a copy of Banqiao Zaji. The shallow me initially thought it was the work of Mr. Zheng Banqiao, but after fully opening the content and checking it, I realized that the so-called Banqiao was where the smoke and powder of Yuling gathered. The author was Yudanxin from Sanshan, who was also a talented person in the late Ming Dynasty. In the Ge Nenniang play, he and Li Shiniang both occupy important supporting roles. He seems to have special feelings for Li Shiniang. He has such a record in the biography of Li Shiniang:</p>
<p>"Then the rebel army crossed the river to the north, and many famous people crossed the river to Qiaojinling. Everyone envied Li Shiniang. Shiniang became more and more secretive, claiming to be sick, not dressing up, and thanking guests. Her mother loved and cherished her, followed her wishes, and politely declined to communicate with them, except for two or three confidants, who were happy to receive her and forget their tiredness. Later, she changed her name to Zhenmei and engraved a seal saying, 'The seal of Li Shizhenmei.' I teased her and said, 'Beauty is there, but chastity is not.' Shiniang wept and said, 'You know me, why do you say this! Although I am a humble dust, I am not a lustful and licentious person, like the woman of Jihejian. If I like someone in my heart, even if I treat each other with respect, my feelings will be harmonious. If I don't like someone in my heart, even if I force myself to sleep with them, I will not be compatible. My lack of chastity is my fate, what can I do?' After saying this, she wept and her clothes were stained with tears."</p>
<p>He said that Ge Nenniang was unparalleled in talent and art. Dong Xiaowan was a needle god and song saint, and was proficient in food recipes and tea scriptures. Bian Yujing was even more remarkable. She was knowledgeable, proficient in small regular script, good at playing the qin, and also good at painting orchids, making wind branches and graceful, and drawing more than ten pieces with one stroke. However, after reading his record of Li Shiniang, it adds a layer of image to people. It is a pity that these many beautiful women, no matter how talented and artistic they are, as for the preservation of chastity, they can only end up with the result of fate. I couldn't help but think of the general female artists of modern times, and shed some sad tears that are the same in ancient and modern times for them.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Talking about Palace Costume Plays <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Xisen</p>
<p>Last Sunday, the Carlton Theater staged Wang Yuying and Wang Huichan double-acting The Drunken Concubine. After Mei Wan Hua retired to Hong Kong, no matter the first- or second-rate Dan actors dared to do it easily, because the palace costume play is a gorgeous and rich drama. The appearance and demeanor, that is, the makeup and costumes, are all based on the principles of magnificence and elegance, and there is no room for any reluctance. Wan Hua's dignified and beautiful appearance and graceful demeanor are enough to exhaust the beauty of the palace costume play. It is appropriate for the remaining sons to hold back and dare not try it lightly in the palace costume play.</p>
<p>Many of the Peking opera plays that were born out of Qinqiang are vulgar and uncultured, while those that were born out of Kunqu Opera are elegant and tasteful. The palace costume play has evolved from Kunqu Opera, so the words are elegant, which is beyond the reach of other Peking opera plays. The Drunken Concubine was created by the actor Wu Hongxi from Eling. Hongxi's stage name was Yueyuehong. During the Tongzhi and Guangxu periods, he took his skills to Beijing and belonged to the Jiaoxi Troupe. At that time, the stage scenery was not valued by people. Wu Ling performed this, and first replaced the stage curtain with a new decoration. Then came the clear songs and wonderful dances, and the audience's minds were all happy and leisurely, and they almost thought they were in the palace. For a time, the people of the capital praised each other, and Wu's name became famous. Wu's nature was very stubborn, and he repeatedly violated the rules of the Pear Garden. On one occasion, during the performance, he even took away his headdress on the spot and quarreled with the public, so he was expelled and no longer performed in Beijing.</p>
<p>After Wu, those who were famous for palace costume plays at the time included Guo Jixiang, Yu Yuqin, and Lu Yushan. Then the palace costume play began to prevail. Wan Hua's skills were obtained from Yu Shan, but after repeated reforms, there were many original ideas, and it was getting farther and farther away from the old school. Today's performers of palace costume plays almost all flaunt the Mei school.</p>
<p>Palace costume plays are suitable for late at night and not for daytime, because the advantages of palace costume plays are entirely based on singing and dancing. Singing and dancing are not easy to gather the audience's spirit. In the late at night, it can make the audience concentrate and appreciate it to their heart's content, listening intently. As for the daytime, the audience's mind is scattered, making the performer even more unskilled, and there is no one who is not drowsy.</p>
<p>Hawthorne's Case</p>

<p>Chapter 1 "A very pretty lady!"</p>
<p>"Who reported the crime?"</p>
<p>"There is a Lu Jiansheng."</p>
<p>"Lu Jiansheng? ——Is that the manager of the Hua Da Bank?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne glanced at me while buttoning his navy blue serge casual clothes. "Do you know this person too? Ni Jinshou is a little anxious about this person. I didn't expect that the power of the bank's tomb would also affect you, a writer."</p>
<p>I was stunned. "How do you know?"</p>
<p>"Your tone and facial expressions both give me that impression."</p>
<p>"Alas, it's not because he is a banker. He does have a considerable status in society. He is the director of the Women and Children Relief Institute, the executive committee member of the Bank Association, and the founder of the Civilian Factory..."</p>
<p>Hawthorne suddenly waved his hand to stop me and said, "Okay, okay. You should stop blindly worshiping and take a closer look at him before you say anything. Don't you know that there are many people in society who wear the masks of 'celebrities' and 'well-known people', secretly doing things that are unscrupulous and shameless? ...Okay, stop talking nonsense. Ni Jinshou seems to be very anxious and is waiting for us anxiously. Let's go."</p>
<p>It was just 7:30 a.m. —— the morning of April 19, Monday. From Hawthorne's residence to Qingpu Road, the car journey was only seven minutes. When Hawthorne stopped the car in front of number 27, a police officer number 99 stationed at the door of the morgue hurried over to open the car door. He was familiar with Hawthorne.</p>
<p>He touched the brim of his hat and greeted, "Mr. Hawthorne, Inspector Ni has been waiting for a long time."</p>
<p>Hawthorne nodded and jumped out of the car. I also got out of the car and closed the car door.</p>
<p>The house number 27 where the case occurred is a semi-new small western-style house with a total of three floors. The outside is plastered with cement, and the windows are steel-framed glass windows, lined with light yellow curtains, and the appearance is very delicate. At this time, a corner of the building window was hit by the sun, shining brightly. This house is isolated, with the door facing Qingpu Road is facing south: the east side is adjacent to the corner of Datong Road; the west side is a small open space. ——(9)</p>

<p>Wu Bangfan, the owner of the Xuan Palace Theater, praised the beauty of Tang Huaiqiu's second daughter Ruoying's acting skills and strongly recommended her to the film industry. A certain company is also quite interested in recruiting her, but this matter may be difficult to achieve, because Ruoying likes to study and is not very interested in going on stage. She only makes occasional guest appearances in the Chinese troupe, and she is even less interested in going on the screen.</p>

Novels and songs are all available, and honorary photos of American stars are given as gifts. It is published every Friday and sold at newsstands.</p>

<p>— Frozen composition Xiu Yan drawing</p>
<p>Ancient and modern storytelling books are as vast as the sea; I think the most suitable for "filling into storytelling songs and broadcasting in Guanxian is none other than A Dream of Red Mansions".</p>
<p>The plot of A Dream of Red Mansions is very complicated, but the center of the description focuses on the love life of Bao and Dai.</p>
<p>There are very few people singing "Dream of the Red Chamber Storytelling Songs", and the script (the storytelling song artist Yang Binkui has it) does not know who wrote it. The reason why it cannot be welcomed should be attributed to the fact that the words in the script are not delicate and elegant enough, and the cutting skills are improper. The writer believes that if it can be compiled into storytelling songs based on Zhong Yun Jian's Dream of the Red Chamber Legend, the beauty of the harvest may be able to surpass "Pearl Tower" and "Tears and Smiles".</p>
