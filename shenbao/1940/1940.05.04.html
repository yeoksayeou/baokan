<p>社評</p>
<h3>生活基本</h3>
<p>由百物騰　，由外滙　縮。加深了人民生活的艱難，反襯了法幣價値的低落；窮人惟恐　以爲生，富人亦恐無以爲繼；實逼處此，痛癢切膚，於是徬徨情緒充溢於整個社會；這是不該諱言，亦是無從掩飾的。</p>
<p>分析原因、推論結果，求治本之道，謀應急之策，則萬千言所說不盡；雖曰說說何妨，　實說之何裨。因爲這種現象，旣非一地之事，亦非一國之事；各國各地的現象，其困窘祗有程度問題，其困窘的萊臨　有先後問題；今日上海居民所感受的困窘、僅較他國他地較酷較早而已。回想前年（一九三八）秋冬之間，上海百業繁榮，蔚爲他地他日、嘗有的黃金時代；時隔不足兩年，徬徨　了繁榮；莫說前年，即以去年而論，百業亦因百貨步漲而欣欣然稱道盈餘，到了現在，百業因百貨步漲之不已雖。盈餘。却反而不能目安，甚且感覺悲觀了，主要癥結在於世界大局的原來秩序遭受了嚴重的搖撼與破壞。搖撼所及，破壞所至，莫說交戰國，莫說危險區，即遠在太平洋彼岸，目前儼然在黃金時代中的美國，即使始終克保中立，始終站於戰爭漩渦之外，但終必因戰爭的搖撼與破壞而遭遇慘烈的損失與苦痛。這是美國業已註定的命運。以富强莫可與京的美國前途，來觀察類於孤島的上　現象，則上海居民今日雖感覺徬徨，誰復怨天尤人？今日雖感覺艱難，還是心安理得吧！論他前途，化我現實，或者期期艾艾以爲吾吾。殊不知上海雖百物騰貴，生活艱難，但事實上羨慕上海如大堂，希望爲上海居民而不可得者，尙不知其凡幾。試檢近月報章雜誌所紀述：柏林居民生活如何？東京居民生活如何？吃肉有限期，吃糖吃鹽有限暈，新衣服新皮鞋不許服用，不得已而要購換衣鞋，須將破舊衣鞋繳官；如此片段紀述，俯拾皆是。上海米貴肉貴白物貴，其實除了物價不貴時生活亦無妥實辦法的人們之外，要是一日三餐改爲兩餐。每飯三四盂改爲二三盂，食必兼味改爲靑菜白飯，則每人節省了數日之後，未始不可略嘗肉味。要而言之，今日上海居民的生活，還不如柏林束京居民淸苦之甚。日本國內外滙無黑市，私買外滙則犯法千軍刑；上海黑市法幣暴落，而日本票却照樣跟了在跌。以此現實相比較，更可心平氣和了。</p>
<p>徬徨究竟亦是不可諱飾的現實。尤普遍可聞的歎息之聲，悲哀之鳴，莫如所謂「物價儘漲，人價不漲」；其意若曰人不如物，若曰人價跟了法幣低落了。如此悲哀歎息，吾們同情於其切實，同情於其沉痛。其實，這是囿於上海一隅，惑於現在一時，而是絕對的錯覺。關於這一點的根本觀念，本報昨日已就中國的法幣與國富，略加說明，茲不再論，今日即就任何個人申論之。</p>
<p>在這世界性的劇烈轉變之中，歷史性的劇烈轉變之中，任何入應知個人生命的估價，原來比平時爲低；生侖猶且如此，則關於目前如何享福的問題，自當置之度外；享得一分福，便算是意外僥倖。至於希望安富尊榮，希望抱殘守缺，旣不應該，亦輒爲事實所不容許。若乃依稀憧憬着已往的什麼好夢，若乃流連迷戀着目前的什麼美景，亦算小上自私自利的乖巧，簡直是忘本的痴愚。因此之故，任何人在觀念上小應再誤認目前生活的艱難困苦爲變態，而必確認困苦艱難乃生活於此大時代中的本分。體認了本分，便能澈悟物質的不値得重視，更何致斤斤於物價貴賤，法幣低昂？吾人並不不否認持有物質與法幣，乃係可愛的生活資本，但在此大時代中，無論爲應付現實計，爲創造前途計，實以「人」爲最値得重視，最可愛的生活資本。不但如此，且係最可恃的生活資本。人的熱力，人的智力，人的體力，有物價所不能比擬的價値，有法幣所不能衡量的價値，有外滙所不能影響的價値；應；現實與創造前途必以人力爲本，而幸福與光明必以人力爲主要因素。買進美金，圃積貨物，豈能干妥萬當，而留得熱力智力體力更盡量發揮運用之，則萬無一失。不但如此，且幾乎無求不得；求而不得，亦應祗憾一己熱力智力體力的小足。以法幣換美金，既損失，且痛心；若熱力智力體力從事生產，更善用此利於輸出的時期，則亦儘可換美金，既多得，且快意。如此云云，絕非僅圖快意；試思爲了物價，爲了法幣，愁眉苦眼以徬徨，豈非根本自忘其爲有可作爲的「人」！以法幣來估量人的價値，是法幣的人，而失其爲人：蓋必以人力來增進法幣價値，始爲人的法幣，抑亦始克保持其爲法幣！希望法幣漲價以增進人價，是倒因爲果；詎若亟自奮發，將自已的熱力智力體力，保養之，增進之，運用之；人力充沛，生產力猛進，這纔是根本之圖。</p>
<h3>五四紀念日　陳誠發表　吿革命靑年書　應認識時代之使命　以完成抗建之大業</h3>
<p>重慶　民國廿九年「五四」紀念日、陳誠發表吿革命靑年　略云、「五四」運動巳屆二十一週年回憶當時靑年、由救國運動促起整個社會思想與文化的革命、造成了我國近代民族自覺自强、與力求解放的革命運動、這種光榮的事實、永遠鼓勵着我們革命靑年、與人作殊死戰、僞　求整個國家民族的光明前途而奮鬥、然社會的變革與歷史的進展、使我們靑年今日所處的環境、與「五四」時代完全兩樣了、而今日中國靑年對於革命所負的責任、也是完全不同、今日我們所處的是抗戰與建國的時代上全國靑年在偉大的領袖蔣委員長的領導之下、進行着對日抗戰、已經奠定了最後勝利的基礎、同時革命建國的大業、也正在着着進展、因此今日我們靑年奮鬥的途徑、應與過去完全不同、而所負的責任、亦與革命之進展同時加重、今天趁地着我們的「五四」紀念日、特就當前時代的使命、與革命靑年的責任、掬誠以告我親愛的靑年同志們、</p>
<p>第一、我們要認識當前時代的使命、是在求第二期國民革命的完成、爲產成這歷史的任務、首先全國靑年要深刻瞭解、國家之統一與民族之獨立、爲現代中國一切問題最基本的前提、唯有求得統一與獨立、才能保持中華民族五千年來的光榮歷史、創造富强　樂的三民主義新中國、因此全國靑年必須統一意志、集中力量、絕對以整個國家民族利益爲前提、並以充分的自覺與自信、愛我們的國家與民族、、愛我們燦爛的歷史、來訓練自己、作一個頂天立地的中國人、</p>
<p>第二、我們要認淸現在與未來的革命責任、靑年主要的革命責任、是在未來、不是現在、因爲現在革命的責任、已經由我們的長輩掮負着、國家對靑年最大的期望、是要求靑年承先啟後、繼往開來、繼續革命先烈的遺志、爲久遠而艱鉅的建國事業而努力、所以領袖訓示我們（中國將來命運、　繫於一般靑年之身）、我們要負起未來的革命責任、母負國家與領袖的期望、只有現在埋頭準備、努力充實建國的智能　鍛練强健精壯的體魄、並特別注意生產技能的培養、與國防科學硏究、以及本國史地文化的潛修、這樣我們靑年才能成爲建國必需的人才、與復興民族的骨幹、此外、我們靑年尤其重要的、是要砥礪忠黨愛國的精神、養　高尙純潔的人格、對於靑年同志之間、必須相親相愛、如手如足、彼此甘苦共嘗、精誠團結、互助合作、具有推已愛人的精神、以造成中國新靑年的道德的典型、</p>
<p>第三、我們要正確的解除靑年本身的苦悶在思想上、只有信仰三民主義是最正確最革命的道路、我們國家在內憂外患之中、能够克服一切困難、　勝日人、完全依靠國民黨有偉大英明的領袖、本黨總裁他喚起全黨同志與全國　民、起來抵　外侮、復興民族、最近三年之間、本黨同志犧牲於槍林彈雨中者、前後已達一日　十萬人這種偉大壯烈的犧牲、是國民黨對於國家民族最大的貢獻、我靑年同志只有在最進步最能奮鬬犧牲的國民黨領導之下、才能謀國家民族的出路、從而謀大家個人的出路、其次、關於靑年生活與職業的苦悶、在抗義建國的勝利過程中、一定會得到澈底的解決、因爲我們過去與現在生活的困難、和失業的痛苦、均由於帝國主義日軍閥對我們種種政治的壓迫、與經濟的侵略、以及國內的軍閥官僚與反動份子剝削破　所造成、今後抗戰勝利、建國成功、則一切被壓迫　剝削的因素、已根本剷除、我們靑年便可以過自由快樂的幸福日子、尤其在建國的過程中、國家需要千百萬的建設人才、我們靑年正可以各盡所能、貢獻國家、來負起建國幹部的資任、</p>
<p>第四、我們靑年應當有目反自覺之精神、增進本身修養的功夫這種修養的功夫、就是要喚　靑年淬勵奮發、砥礪自立自强之精神、以克服惡劣的環境、消除對社會的怨尤、我們知道靑年對於政治的不滿、與社會的煩悶、原是不可辦免的、但是我們應當求之在己、從今立志刷新政治、改革社會、因爲未來的社會是我們的、那些腐敗的成份、終將爲時代的輪齒所毀滅、我們要緊的是振作自己、發奮圖强、將來從我們自己的身上　　一個完　的社會、如果我們不注意這點、徒然怨天尤人將來難免小蹈前人覆轍、試看「五四」時代打曹汝霖的靑年現在怎樣了呢、這是眼前的經騐與　證、我們必須引爲炯戒、做到（己所勿欲勿施於人）、則未來的世界、方能一代勝過一代、最後、我們要瞭解目前靑年運動的特點、是建設的、統一的、積極的不是破壞的、消極的、過去靑年運動往往只有人的關係、而無組織的領導、只憑感情的衝動、而不重理智的分析、因此靑年成了投機者私人的、或派系歸爭的工具、作了無爲的犧牲品、而「五四」運動之所以不能貫激持久，也正因爲缺乏組織與訓練、現在自三民中義靑年團成立以後、靑年運動有了顯明的目標、今後全國靑年在統一的組織　訓練之下，每一個人都成了國家的靑年、因此我們必須羣策羣力　一致從事社會服務與生產建設、幷埋頭充實建國的智能、以統一的、建設的、積極的靑年運動、來推動社會的進化、促成革命建國的大業、總之我們靑年今日處在抗戰建國的偉大時代中、必須　淸歷史的時代的使命、與本身的革命的責任、來努力爲國家民族謀出路、換言之、就是要貢獻個人的平等自由、以求取國家民族的平等自由、總理北上與黃埔同學最後吿別時、曾訓示我們「大家要希望革命成功、便先要犧牲個人的自由、個人的平等、把各人的自由平等、都貢獻到革命黨內來、只許黨有自由、個人不能自由、然後我們的革命才可以望成功）、這段遺敎、是總理對於靑年革命救國的最懇切的指示、我們希望每個立志革命的靑年同志、要遵照這偉大的遺敎、從今便有充分的準備、與堅强的組織和訓練、夾替國家民族謀出路、這出路決不是少數人的出路、而是四萬萬五千萬人共同一致的康莊大道、三民中義的革命的康莊大道、靑年同志們、我們是革命的先鋒隊、我們要勇敢的向着三民主義新中國的道路、齊步邁進、（三日電）</p>

<h3>人心已失理智控制　黃金又起非常漲風　午後高峯見七千二百元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、漲風再接再厲、續創有史以來黃金新高峯、蓋人心至此已失其理智控制也只顧跟隨前進、故全日過程、午前變動尙狹且初開反撳數十元、嗣後高低互見、而緊張之一幕始自午後、蓋聞外匯暴緊、已至有行無市狀態、經營者一時手足無措、證券帮金號等遂不惜貴價、十致狂搜、價即飛出七千元大關、見七千二百元、繼以多頭獲利、急急回吐、霎時間復降爲六千八百五十元、其中上落差度、恒有一二百元之鉅、塲內人心頗感不安、特提早半小時收盤、便爲六千九百元、較上日再軋升四百十五元、計四天連漲共一千三百餘元、全天交易約四千兩有餘銀樓飾金再吿在跳、竟一度創見七百三十元高價、後雖稍回但結果尙漲五十元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤再漲四百元強</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開外匯鬆平、人心略挫、開時賣者頗多、即撳八十五元、銀號出金號三十兩、爲六千四百元、嗣有銀號及錢兌業等乘低大撈、而匯市忽報趨緊、散戶亦跟跡力扒、不久即飛漲二百元、銀號進金號十兩、爲六千六百元、但斯時六千六百元限價賣戶頗湧、散戶見景脫手、加之金號錢兌業證券幫等互相塞出、頓回小六十元、證劵幫出金號三十兩、爲六千五白四十元、時錢兌業稍有吃胃、復漲二十元、錢兌業進金號二十兩、爲六千五百六十元、顧以外匯轉平、重見回小五十元、金號互做三十兩、爲六千五百十元、將近收盤時、金號突來復入、再又高起五十五元、金號進銀號二十兩、爲六千五百六十五元、收後曾小五元、但金號銀號幫扒進、而賣戶絕跡、抬至六千五百九十元、尙無賣戶、午後開時人心更佳、一跳六十元、銀號進金號二十兩、爲六千六百五十元、但其時金號銀號等沽出、回小三十五元、金號對做三十兩、爲六千六百十五元、不意此時再吿在漲、乃聞匯市大緊、且吿有行無市、人心恐慌萬分、證劵幫首來猛購、接踵金號錢兌業力進、雖有浮多獲利不斷吐出、但頭寸終感枯竭、竟飛躍五百八十五元、金號進銀號五十兩、爲七千二百元、後證劵幫突轉買爲賣、且匯市略吿回硬、遂回入七千元大關、銀號出錢兌業卅兩、爲六千八百五十元、入後市塲情形更形紊亂、進出價竟差一百元之多、故當時經同業議決提早收市、作價爲六千九百元收市、結果比上日再漲四百十五元、查已連漲四天、共計一千三百二十八元、全天八百元上落、收後塲外七千元有買戶而無售者、現金號之本脾金售出價、照烚赤較高十元、收進减低卅元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金掛過七百卅元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸六百六十元、迨至九時三刻、掛高十元、十時五十三分回小十元、十二時復見掛大五元、二時續高十元、二時二十分又大十元、二時四十分父高十元、三時二十分竟在跳三十五元、時創見七百三十元有市以來之空前紀錄、三時三十分回小二十元、三時三十八分續回低十元、四時十五分重掛大十元、結果共大五十元、計大同行改懸七百十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣狂跳　午後尤甚</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、午前漲勢尙緩、美金票進退於二十元關口、英美金鎊盤旋於一百四五十元間、午後又起驚人巨變、黑市英匯縮至三便士一二五、美匯　至四元五角以內、金價竟發現七千二百元空前高價、是以英美金鎊暨金票等漲風復熾、美金票曾昂達二十三元、嗣稍退爲二十一元五角、比上日續漲一元、香港票隨港滬匯兌劇漲二角半、此外如法郎票及新加坡荷蘭安南羅比加拿大斐律濱等票買氣亦盛、市價一致大漲、日金票需要又殷、價漲三分、晚市爲一元二角九分、朝鮮票供求尙匀、晚市仍爲九角八分七</p>
<h3>證券　洋股漲風　結束變幻之一週　公債亦起小漲風</h3>
<p>證券昗盤、昨日忽見回漲、聞乃一般投機份子、初則賣出公債、買進金子、今則賣出金子、買進公債、一反復間獲利甚厚、故債市乃起意外之波瀾、惟銀根太緊、做金子須吃息四分半之多、故多賣出而買回公債、交易無非補空而已、絕少新多頭、昨日交易、上午爲買戶佔優、午後父爲賣戶佔優勢、聯和聯益二十號三十八號早晚均有補空、散戶大都尙在吃進、鴻大協大同順久豐怡泰鴻康等等多數、爲銀行現貨流出、多數爲多頭斬割、行市高而復低、但仍好起四角至八角、成交八十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交漢冶萍二百股、價爲三元七角半、衆業股市、因外滙冉縮、在澎湃買氣下、結束變幻多端之一週、此所經之短短週期交易、固有不少手執現鈔者、彷徨失措於其間、眞正投資者無論已、即常思以少博多之投機家、亦何嘗不具同感乎、多種股價本能的又吿上騰、惟收盤時因浮多了結關係而有些微回風、第不知未來月曜日新交易登塲時之滙市如何、苟其仍爲現狀不變、或甚至更趨惡化、則昨日所見之漲風、將徒爲大漲前之前奏、至於實業股或橡皮股孰能獲得最大推動、爲難以預測之事、在評述一般市况前、下列二項所中短訊、或爲關心者所樂聞、上海企業公司即將增加資本、添發新股、（每二舊股可得三新股新股發行價爲五元五角）該股昨已升至七元半、發行事宜概由會德豐公司經理、中和地產公司將付特種股息二元、該股昨漲至二十元七五買進、似猶甚覺低廉、上海業廣中國墾植英聯等股成交最多、會德豐漲勢甚銳、昨收與前收較計漲十元有零、鋼美股亦上騰至五十一元、開平股自七十三元漲至七十六元、怡和股成交不惡、漲達七十六元（除息）、祥泰木行股因其所宣布之股息優越、引起一般人爭扒、扳至七十三元尙苦小得購得大量股票、橡皮股情形堅挺、少數出售之股、開盤後被攫殆盡、在現價下各股甚少有人出讓、此等現象、見於各種優等股者爲尤甚、</p>
<p>英商祥泰木行有限公司第三十八次常會股東大會、定於五月二十四日舉行、會畢繼續舉行特別股東大會、一九三九年三月一日至一九四〇年二月底一年度之末次股息、擬續派每股國幣四元、速中期共派國幣六元五角、</p>
<h3>紗花　無力購紗　消費大減</h3>
<p>上日猛騰之紗布、昨則稍見平靜、惟一般投機者心思依然熱烈、忽進忽出、甚爲忙碌、但實際交易、形同停頓、因其價格在騰之後、無力購買、消費大爲减少、五月份期貨頂峯價曾達一千七百五十五元、回跌至一千七百元、目前紗市仍在飄蕩小定中、升降範圍龐大、就此向論、前途危險性極大</p>
<p>現紗晨開承上日之人氣續挺、且一般掮客高抬尤烈、二十支雙馬現貨價爲一千七百二十元、比上日再漲六十元、旋以外滙開出安定、實銷冷落、迅速下降至一千六百四十元、高低相差八十元之鉅、繼以空頭抵補、復上一步、查半日間成交統計一千四百二十五包、行情二十支雙馬現漲十元、又棉紗今（四日）有二十二件、運柱香港、又十件運往土樂、茲將各幫買去之額量分列如左、</p>

<h3>棉價登峯造極　廠需因之停頓</h3>
<p>本棉交易殊屬寥寥、廠方絕端無採辦之舉動、惟同行間有互相買賣、此因價格已在登峯造極之境矣、茲將現棉成交情形列左、</p>
<p>火草包二二八·〇〇同行進九九〇包</p>
<p>奧姆拉二七六·五〇又　二〇〇件</p>
<p>通打包二五五·〇〇　又　二五三件</p>

<p>米特林　三一〇·〇〇　三一六·〇〇　又　三〇〇件</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市　、紐約棉市、昨日殊爲靜寂、後因利物浦來電低落及一部份之南方套賣、因之市况下疲、結果收盤價格較之上日近期跌四五磅　、遠期跌十餘磅音、印度棉市因上海之匯市暴落、遠東交易頓减、連同預測跌六羅比、埃及漲三十餘磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、殊爲靜寂、　業前訂購之裝船印棉、大部係羅比價格、蓋因日來銀根奇緊、結進匯票不多、故此次匯兌之暴縮、蒙害者頗多、同業之藏有現貨者、因銀根奇緊之故、高價無買主、低價却不願脫手、故目前之情况異常混亂、有行無市、今後之局面將不知如何殊難預料也、（昨日所刊者、係五月一日之市况、附此聲明）</p>
<h3>疋頭　布疋囤戶　擁而來</h3>
<p>棉布晨開平定、蓋以貨價狂抬後、實銷愈顯冷落、匯市略穩、浮多頗有照市便宜、以圖了結、故市勢轉鬆、市盤較上日晚收時爲廉、惟午後一聞匯市再度緊縮、刺激人心、父反賣爲買、各貨售盤白貨已稍平穩、每疋漲五角之譜、原盤小加者亦多、不退色各布以顏料悉用歐產售盤狂抬五六元不等、全日交易以本街同業及業外囤戶占大多數、綜計現期貨約千餘件、客銷仍無起色、而本街門市零剪以票價多數尙未提高、生意陡增、</p>
<p>東布白貨龍頭細布晨開現棧單售每疋五十三元二角半、嗣以同業多頭吐出者多、至午收盤降至五十二元二角、詎知午後因外匯又縮業外囤戶蠭擁而來、市氣頓緊、一度升至現貨五十五元期貨五十七元二角半收盤、人心仍堅、現盤價爲五十四元九角、本月期五十七元、四君子嗶嘰現出每碼爲一元五角八分半、本月份一元六角半、</p>
<h3>一片喊聲同漲價　可憐生活倍艱辛</h3>
<p>自黃金外匯飛漲、米商利用以居奇、高價迭出、　般以洋米前途定貨之困難、均　手中所有者僞奇貨、立升一元、浮囤散戶又從　批波作浪、互相追逐、迄中市若一號西　遂達五十二元之頂峯、他如二號　喊五十元、火絞五十元出零、小絞四十九元、竟有三四元之上落、人心至是亦不無瞻顧、實售最高價二號爲四十九元半、火絞四十九元半、小絞四十八元半、獲利者趁高脫手回落半元至一元、若收盤行悄較之前市實提二元半光景、粳糯國米際此洋米奔騰中、相互牽引、並呈漲風、糯米計增二元、開溧特元四十四元、四十三元半、中市之常丹貨四十二元半至四十元、粳米傳聞塲外暗盤成交殊夥、亦升二元半左右、開無錫特淸坯五十元、常崑白粳四十八九元、靑泗特薄四十九元、大市四十八元半、四十八元、南港早稻特四十八元、次至十六元半、</p>
<p>洋米昨日飛黃騰達、上午抬高二三元、下午再抬二三元、一日間漲起四五元、已到一號原包自六十元開價至六十一元六角、一號自五十七元二角開價逐步上升、下午至五十九元半、五月上自五十八元半至六十一元、已到暹羅二號原包目五十七元半至九十八元半、小絞現貨最爲熱鬧、早市開價四十七元八角至八元三角收市、下午漲至五十元〇五角、晚市略平二三角、漲風之烈殊爲少見、實被一般投機所造成、故總成交現米一萬六七千包、實銷不足十分之三、原包路現貨亦有七百多噸、</p>
<p>油豆晨因浮囤亟出籠、市氣不穩、上午收盤行情、漲跌互見、詎至午後情形突變、因全潮猖獗、人心震驚、市價又猛抬、結果油市再漲一二元、豆價續升一元三四角、其市盤統詳市價欄、</p>
<p>麵粉昨日廠盤、亦增加三角、改爲十三元八角現鈔、今日或星期一尙須續加二三角、以粉爲日僞　撓、及新麥又有統制之說、回籠貨老車牌喊價亦與廠盤相埒、結果價開十三元七角三分至七角七分、其他內地粉亦須十三元三四角、成交併計約有一萬餘包、北洋幫略有問津、　砲車客盤亦由十四元六角升至十五元、惟　麥交易、依然呆滯、市價檳持、</p>
<p>糖市以外滙猛縮後、迄未轉鬆、上午公會劃盤、漸有做開、現貨二四粗白本棧貨七十四元至七十三元半、外　新貨初爲七十三元、旋至七十三元半、後仍爲七十三元、老貨七十二元半、成交計一千五六百包、轉口貨四五十七元、太古車白B嘜四八十四五元、H嘜車赤四六十元、荷赤四六十四元、轉口五十三元、本廠雪白四七十四元、結果粗白實漲十元、午後聞外匯又緊、出戶又叫升數元、在黑市外匯未鬆以前、似無回低之象、國糖因亦追踪上展、東鄉赤百三十件、五十三元、條靑數十簍、四十七元、刁靑五十包、六十元、均升七元之譜、貢戈赤百餘件、竟達六十一元、查糖今有二千一百包、運往天津、</p>
<p>煤業市塲、自前日滙市　變、當即停止交易、至昨始有正式開市、烟白煤一致加起三四十元行情、計做印度喀爾喀答烟煤每噸三百元、婆羅洲烟煤每噸二百九十五元、鴻基白煤二百零五元、海峯白煤二百十二元、小子二百十元、以上均同業行拆、門莊發客酌加十餘元行情、</p>
<p>五金行盤、又比前高起二成、甚至亦有三成者、如二百磅會司鐵每箱售一百九十元、九十磅雙連馬口鐵每箱喊二百二十元、一百磅雙連馬口鐵二百七十元、新鉛絲（十六號至二十號）達百二十元關、黑鐵坯子竟出千二百元外、此種紊亂之價、實所稀見、</p>

<h3>發揚五四精神　靑年界團結奮鬥　今日熱烈慶祝靑年節　市黨部三靑團發表文告　朂勉靑年完成抗建大業</h3>
<p>今日爲五四運動紀念日、並經中央規定爲靑年節、全國各地靑年、今日均將有熱烈慶　、本市靑年界、雖在特殊環境下、不舉行慶祝儀式、但鑒於靑年爲國家柱石、民衆前鋒、當此國難時期、職責最爲重大、決砥礪氣節、振奮精神、鍛鍊體魄、修養學業、貢獻全部力量與國家民族、以爭取抗戰最後勝利、庶五四運動之革命精神、益得發揚光大、</p>
<p>市常部告　靑年界書</p>
<p>中國國民黨上海特別市執行委員會吿上海靑年、略云、「五四」運動、是中國靑年運動的勝利紀念節、我們回想當時、靑年學生的磊落光明的聲討賣國賊、反對日本帝國主義的二十一條、力爭拒絕巴黎和約簽字、抵制日貨等等的奮鬥精神、充分地表示了愛護國家民族的誠摯熱烈的心理、我們應該明瞭、民國八年的「五四」運動、係爲國民黨的國民革命所啟示、乃克獲得空前效果、我們更應該明瞭能够集中堅信三民主義的知識靑年偉大力量、是以打擊日本帝國主義的侵略政策、和一切反動的惡勢力、當此日軍橫行中國、傀儡登塲之時、知識靑年們、尤須加倍努力、發揮「五四運動」的精神、集中意志力量、在國民黨和最高領袖蔣總裁領導之下、一致團結起來、體念中央旣定的抗建國策、摧毀日僞的惡勢力、我們的口號、是（一）發揮五四運動的精神、（二）完成抗戰建國的大、（三）摧毀日僞的惡勢力、（四）擁護國民政府（五）三民主義萬歲、</p>
<p>三靑闡明　紀念意義</p>
<p>三民主義靑年團，爲紀念「五四」、發表吿靑年書云、「五四」運動、是中華民族在近代史上一個重要的轉捩點、牠非但在思想界文化界都激起澎湃的怒潮、使當時的思想文化、有劃時代的進步、同時也使當時未臻澄淸的政治機構及政客官僚、有所警惕畏忌、他們知道這種新的思想和新的力量、使解脫了滿淸束縛的</p>
<p>中華民族</p>
<p>不能再變相的給少數人所操縱了、我們再揭開一五四」以後的史跡、檢看一下、我們民族每次受强暴凌辱而造成的幾次慘案、那一次不是由知識靑年的學生份子起來反抗、領導羣衆、向壓迫者堅强的抗爭、這些</p>
<p>血的事跡</p>
<p>為民族爭生存而英勇的犧牲、都深印吾人腦海、凡中華民國的國民、對於這些秉承「五四」的精神而熱忱愛國的靑年、應一致加以敬愛、這裏我們還得正吿侵略者、不應忽視潛在每個中華靑年血液裏的「五四」精神、自鳴得意的侵略者、往往</p>
<p>逞着氣　、一味蠻橫、恣意壓迫、他們只知这中國懦弱、却不知道革命後的中國、在外觀上雖未十分健全、而國民的意識、靑年們的堅毅熱忱、決非舊時代的中國所可比擬、這便是他們沒有瞭解「五四」學生運動在中國一般知識界及靑年羣衆所發生的影響、民國十五年以前、侵略者的參謀部陸軍部所調查報吿的、都說</p>
<p>國民政府</p>
<p>不能統一中國、軍人沒有國家觀念、革命軍不能完全統一中國、那知民國十五年到十七年、中華民國畢竟由三民主義的革命軍統一了、這是侵略者的估計錯誤、这一次的戰爭、他們以爲用速戰速決的手段、便可以實現征服整個中國的夢想、這夢想又破碎了、又用了</p>
<p>政治攻勢</p>
<p>外交攻勢、但這些攻勢、反使中國的抗戰愈趨堅強、民衆的熱忱更趨熾烈、這是侵略者又一次的估計錯誤、而這些錯誤的由來、都因爲不明白中國靑年自「五四」以後都受了新思想的洗禮、有着堅强的意志和沸騰的熱血、中國的知識份子、也決不是迂腐懦弱之流了、這種侵略者的</p>
<p>估計錯誤、因為民族隔膜、才產生這樣的結果、中國絕大多數和靑年、都是自覺的優秀份子、在堅强的抗戰中、靑年們更磨練得英勇堅定、自今而後、靑年們更應該發揚「五四」的精神、增强抗戰意識、給奸僞們無情的打擊、這才是民族革命的實踐、歷史任務的完成、也是紀念、五四」學生運動的唯一目的、三靑團上海支團部、</p>
<p>靑年勵行　廉恥運動</p>
<p>本市各大中學學生自動響應廉恥運動、組織勵行團者、已有七十餘單位、爲謀統一行動起見、已有上海市靑年界廉恥運動委員會之組織、茲値「五四」紀念、發表吿同學書、印發大批傳單、通吿各勵行團是日出動宣傳、其原文略誌如下、今天我們紀念五四」、除了謹守的崗位力謀知能之充足外、同時並舉下列各點、和我靑年界同人共相勗勉、（一）發揚固有道德、堅樹精神堡壘、「五四」運動以來、新文化勃興、中國也怒吼了、可是一般士子、醉心歐化、擯棄了中國固有的精華、所以二十餘年來、政治毫無進步、而且外來的侵略、一天加甚一天、其實我們對於新文化固應盡量接受、同時對於良好的舊道德、也應提倡發揚、禮義廉恥、是我們中國數千年文化之所繫、方今奸惡橫行、皆由於廉恥道喪之故、所以我輩靑年、務須以禮義廉恥爲思想行動的指針、排除物愁、堅定意志、以「白刃可蹈、爵祿可辭」的決心、加强利誘威脅的防禦、務使魑魅魍魎、絕跡於我們的四周、（二）認淸目標、確定前進趨向、我們要在目前偉大的時代中、免於墮落、首先要明辨順逆、識別是非、以確定自身前進的趨向、我們全市靑年同學、過去努力此項工作、已有相當表現、惟此後史應認淸目標、沉着應付粉碎陰謀的侵襲、（三）刻苦耐勞、勵行節的運動、靑年學生、處身孤島、環境如此、固然是一種不幸、也是一種難得的光榮際遇、因環境給我們以苦難、同時也給我們以磨鍊身心、砥礪志節的好塲所、我們務須滌除舊習、刻苦淬厲，於日常生活中、養成整齊·淸潔·簡單·樸素之習慣、革除凌亂·汚穢·繁複·奢侈之惡習、實踐極端的節約與辛勞艱苦的生活、以挽救社會經濟之衰落、在暴的風雨、正在孤島激盪着、悖理的壓迫、和慘酷的摧殘、踵接而來、我們要維護正義、在各種腐惡勢力的夾攻之下、抗禦掙扎、以完成神聖的歷史使命、</p>
<h3>昨日市塲謠言漸息　法定外匯不變　目前限制係防止日偽套取　平準會仍當繼續維持滙市</h3>
<p>中國政府決心維持幣制穩定外滙後、對上海外匯黑市、暗中由平準外匯基金委員會、與英商匯豐等銀行、通力合作設法維持、所以上海黑市外匯、雖在日僞及投機者操縱之下、而匯市仍得站在新水平綫上、今因匯豐銀行限制供給、致英美匯價猛縮市塲混亂、人心不安、聞平準外匯基金委員會決本過去之宗旨辦理、除竭力穩定法定外匯外、對黑市外匯、仍以設法維持爲原則外傳種種、殊不可信、</p>
<p>黑市外滙　酌予限制</p>
<p>外匯等市塲謠言、昨日起已漸平息、人心稍安英商匯豐銀行掛牌已趨穩定、與前日相同、惟實際行市略縮、新聲社記者特往訪某某二大銀行負責人員、據談、外匯黑市之猛縮、因香港方面停止供給之故、至於平準外匯基金委員會之基金、總額爲一千萬英鎊、現在依然甚爲充實、對暗市維持上海外匯黑市、爲防止日僞之陰謀、及投機者之操縱、故不得不予以相當限制、並非完全停止供給、其限制辦法如何、非普通人所能知、並聞平準外匯基金委會對限制辦法、決不公佈、</p>
<p>法定價格　始終不變</p>
<p>關於法定外匯平準外匯基金委員會決以全力維持之、所以法定外滙、依然穩定、並不因上海黑市外滙緊縮有所變動、中央銀行昨晨之法定外匯掛牌、英匯一先令二辦士半、美滙三十元、凡進口商經營之進口物品、不在禁止輸入之列、而爲國內所必需者、得向外滙審核委員會、申請購買法定外匯、同時結滙出口之土貨於實際結淸滙額後、得憑結算證件、向結滙銀行領取法價與該行掛牌價格之差額、此則足證法定外匯並未變動、政府維持法定外匯政策始終如一、黑市外匯之劇變、與法定外滙完全無關、</p>
<p>平準基金　數甚充裕</p>
<p>關於平準外匯基金委員會平準基金、總額爲一千萬英鎊、自成立迄今、爲維持外滙耗去之數及所餘存基金若干、因事關黑市滙率、所以當局嚴守秘密、昨據新聲社記者向某外商銀行探悉、該委員會之基金、外人方面之猜測的尙餘三分之一强、約爲四百萬鎊、且有增加平準基金五百萬鎊之說、所以維持法定外匯以及黑市外滙之力綽乎有餘、且財政當局對於匯率、早已聲明決心維持、但黑市外匯之低落、有利中國土貨之輸出、並能阻止奢侈品非必需品之從淪陷區域海關輸入、</p>
<p>及時調整　勢非得已</p>
<p>據余融界權威昨日表示、此次滙率改縮、適在新「中央銀行」籌備委員會成立之後、其爲對付偽行之步驟、顯而易見、因僞行旣無準備、難免不假日行之手、套取外滙、以充準備、而日行即以所出套買外滙之法幣、作爲日行貸與「新中央銀行」之借款、上月底數日之間售出美金、近八百萬、政府長此無限供給、必致被人利用、其理甚明、况今年第一季入超一千七百萬鎊、較去年同期之九百九十萬鎊、幾增一倍、亦非予以調整不可、</p>
<p>日方將受　致命打擊</p>
<p>外滙縮之影響、物價固因以高漲、民生艱難、但在日本方面、所受打擊更大、因其所擬之金融計劃、盡被粉碎若仍繼續實行套滙、則其佔領區內旣不能將法幣壓倒、再加一「寄生於法幣乏通貨、徒使通貨趨於膨脹、金融陷於紊亂、欲自立健全之通貨、又無此財力、進退兩難、故在華流通之日元、鮮幣以及「聯銀券」等等、均與法幣同昇同降　貨幣本身毫無獨立之價値</p>
<h3>乘機高抬物價　決嚴厲禁阻　兩租界當局申令　將採取最嚴制裁</h3>
<p>黑市匯價、昨日再度下跌、美票又漲、公共租界及法租界當局、深恐投機份子、從中牟利、而使市塲更形混亂、決定採取相當措置、以抑制投機份子之活動、並發布吿如次、</p>
<p>工部局佈告</p>
<p>公共租界工部局昨發布吿云、凡售賣各種必需品之商人、倘利用中國國幣匯價之變動、將各該項物品之售價、無理高抬、本局當予禁阻、</p>
<p>法當局警告</p>
<p>法租界平價委員會警吿云、爲警吿事、照得法租界當局、對於凡利用中國法幣價值變動之機會、而擬非法實行漲價者、將採取最厲之制裁、法警務處經已奉令、嚴格執行法總領事署一九四〇年二月十九日第七十八號署令第十一條之規定、仰各商民一體遵照、凛之、此布、一九四〇年五月三日、</p>
<p>物價驟漲　商店擁擠</p>
<p>查本市物價、昨一日中、均一致飛漲、米價昨日不論西貢米及國米、均曾售至五十元左右、所有百貨商店中、顧客空前擁擠、蓋居民均恐物價日後更將飛漲、對日常用品、不得不稍作準備也、但事實上一切日用品之市價、自昨日起、已吿漲價矣、</p>
<p>米市　隉　又圖操縱</p>
<p>米市投機份子、乘匯市之變化、又圖操縱米價、惟實銷胃口旣弱、市塲全係投機賣買、故昨日米市塲、於開市後二小時內、米價漲跌三次、市塲情形、杌隉不安、米業團體前曾議決制止市塲有賣空買空交易、今又値緊張局面、故再吿誡同業、遵守市塲規則、不得有越軌行為、並為防止非同業利用游資參加投機、混亂米市起見、特冉行通知同業、貨物交易、需客售與行、行售與店、不得違背是項規約、</p>
<p>煤球竟又再度加價</p>
<p>煤球廠盤門售市價、曾於上月二十一日起、由該業公會召開廠商聯席會議、議決遞增售價、一度引起社會人士之注意、暨與論界之指斥、並上海市商會亦去函制止、力勸愼勿追踪在潮、顧全大局、然該業竟聲　成本浩繁、維持爲難、對於外界指斥、滔滔辨解、顧煤球確爲滬市市民每日不可缺乏之必需燃料物品、較貧平民莫不遭受嚴重打擊、茲該業竟又藉口外匯暴縮、成本提高、不易維持爲推詞、於昨日公然議決、再度遞增市價、廠盤每噸漲二十三元、門市每担改售八元五角、已於昨日起實行、今據確實消息、煤屑存底、並不稀尠、况來源亦頗暢旺、故全市四百萬市民莫不渴盼當局迅行究辦、取締非法交易、並即令飭燃料各有關團體、頒訂嚴密市塲買賣規則以期投機者無法施展</p>
<p>畸形繁榮　將臨末日</p>
<p>滬市戰後人口、因成爲各方避難集中地、號稱四百餘萬、確數如何、未據正式統計、不得而知、觀於兩特區房屋求過於供、人口較戰前確有增加、殆無疑義、而戰後租界之消費繁榮、即由於此大量人口支撑之、茲據觀察家談、滬市兩年來、物價步步騰貴、始終成直綫形、米價煤價及日用品、莫不一漲再漲、迄於今日、多數人尤其薪工階級、已不能維持生計、而食指衆多之家庭、痛苦尤甚、「上海居大非易」、幾人人有此感覺、據測、滬市在高物價威脅下、人口不久將大量减少、商業市塲亦隨趨蕭條、屆時市上空房櫛比、一如過去不景氣時期之現象、而目前追跡在潮之囤戶、以及不正當商人、亦同歸傾覆、</p>

<p>關於提議工部局發行市政慈善獎券一事、業經該局董事會就倫理上法律上與經濟上各點、加以討論、結果認爲無論其爲慈善性質、究非裨益公衆之善策、未便實行、其最大理由、厥爲原則問題、良以局方對於禁止公衆賭博一事、早具決心、本屆納稅外僑年會、並由總董樊克令剴切闡明、此次經大多數董事之決議、認爲禁止賭博、爲公衆利益着想、應予維持、</p>
<p>法律論點</p>
<p>發行市政獎券、含有公共賭博性質、局方除在原則上與倫理上不能實行外、即於法律一點、亦屬重大疑問、如果局方準備發行、則各董事等勢將紛紛要求　證、確保渠等並未有違反各該國法律之行爲也、關於　事、　　工部局律師與法律顧問參考中英美三國法典、查</p>
<p>英國法律</p>
<p>規定發行獎券、爲不正當行爲、工部局任何英籍職員苟參與其事、或任何英籍董事、爲此事之主腦或發起人、則將受起訴之處分、按諸</p>
<p>美國法律</p>
<p>凡僑居中國之美籍人士、有經營賭塲或發行獎劵者、即爲犯罪行爲、復次、按諸</p>
<p>中國刑法</p>
<p>第二六九條之規定、發行獎券、苟非事前獲有政府核准、即屬非法行爲、各該國籍職員及董事、如參與此類不正當措置者、除將被提起公訴外復有被提起私訴之虞、在事實上、局方經已接　某納稅人來函、謂渠將運用一切適當法律步驟、阻止市政獎券之發行、</p>
<p>獎劵性質</p>
<p>至於租界曾核准銷售獎券兩種、　次亦經加以　究、此類獎劵、具有正當之特殊性質、一爲國家經營、經中國政府許可者、一爲本局核准者、其理由爲適應公衆之需要、</p>
<p>利害研究</p>
<p>若干董事以爲局方發行市政獎券、對於租界之財政地位與信譽、均有損害、至於由發行獎券而所得實益、究有多少、亦屬疑問、或謂無論其收人多寡、可局方增加經費、以用於社會救濟事業如醫院、收容所等等、因現行之收入、僅足應付必要開支也、或謂局方如欲籌措救濟用款、其道不一、例如徵收娛樂捐等等、而租界救濟工作之眞正需要、可賴社會人士源源供給、以往救濟難民工作、即屬明證、故局方斷不可以財力有限難於應付社會工作之支出、爲發行市政獎券之理由也、</p>
<h3>離埠不慎　挪輪肇禍</h3>
<p>撞毀拖駁三艘　日漁船亦受傷</p>
<p>天祥洋行經理之挪威商輪Taisman號、儎重五千餘噸、於上月十九自美裝儎大枇貨物來滬、適因歐戰擴大、挪威國遭德軍襲擊、該輪駛至近滬大戢洋海面、被英艦迫令開回香港後、挪輪得准許復航、該輪於二十七日復由港來滬、停靠虹口公和祥碼頭卸貨、上述各情、已迭誌前報、茲悉該輪於</p>
<p>昨晨七時</p>
<p>離滬赴小呂宋、約本月二十一日再來上海、然後開往紐約、在起椗時、照例備滙德豐小輪拖帶、離開碼頭出口、斯時係落潮東南風甚緊、小輪張先將大輪船尾拖開。大輪倒車退出碼頭、船頭再向外揚出、而後前駛、因小輪力薄、兼之風大水急、一時無法拖開、但大輪</p>
<p>已打倒車</p>
<p>船身後向後退、致將停泊附近之匯德豐鐵駁一艘、父碼頭木壳駁船二隻衝撞、一本質駁船立時毀壞、另一駁船及滙德豐之鐵駁、受損亦甚重、又間接將一日本漁船、約四五十噸大小、亦被撞傷甚鉅出事後、日水警遂領該漁船船主、至天祥洋行交涉、</p>
<p>保留賠償</p>
<p>責任、一方自行修理、聞天祥洋行已尤許俟調查後正式答覆、又丹麥輪GertrudeMaersk號、，前日（一日）晨由日本開來、停靠公和祥碼頭船尾亦被撞、受傷尙微、有數駁船被撞毀、幸船夫無恙、挪輪肇禍後、船主即檢查船身、計機葉一爿上有一角打落、惟對行駛上、並無關碍、一方並報告天祥洋行、轉知保險行、故當</p>
<p>暫停出口</p>
<p>前延至十時許離滬、赴香港小呂宋、</p>

<h3>滬西「亦盧」門前　司機死得離奇　身上毫無半點傷痕　衣後竟有一塊血漬</h3>
<p>昨晨二時許、滬西海格路三百六十八號亦廬賭窟前、發現一離奇血案、死者衣上有鮮紅血漬一大塊、但經檢騐後、身上並無任何創傷、殊稱奇異、據平明社記者訪息詳情如後、</p>
<p>猝斃車旁</p>
<p>昨晨二時五十一分、祥生汽車公司突接亦應賭窟來一電話、謂該公司門前有一司機死於車勞、當由公司遣人前往查察，見死者　係該公司一八四七七照會汽車之司機、當即軍送紅十字會、然已氣絕身死、當由紅十字會報吿靜安寺捕房、捕房以出事地點係在「歹土」弄堂內、亦無法調查、</p>
<p>肘下法幣</p>
<p>該司機屍體、係躺臥於亦廬門前地上、上衣腰背間、有殷紅血漬的小盤子大、肘旁下面有一元法幣一張、上衣袋並有車費簽字單一紙、及車費法幣三五、　該公司司機方面稱、按司機人習慣、車資收後、向來安　於上衣錶袋內、死者車資竟置於上衣下袋內、當係死後他人所放、且車到亦廬門前、向由該「廬」看門將車費送上、司機者不必下車、今該司機死於地上、常係生前被害身死、</p>
<p>一般推測</p>
<p>死者為　店人、名丁慶祥、年四十三歲，平日爲人忠厚、與人無爭、此案旣非仇殺、又不似謀財密命、雖其身上並無傷痕、但其衣上血漬推測、或必有一重大事故發生在其車內、爲死者所明知、故一併謀害、以滅其口、亦未可知、</p>

<h3>禁造銅器</h3>
<p>近近來新銅無從採辦，滇礦所　，工本不敷，運脚又大，而各省停鑄之後，新錢不出，舊錢又少，小錢又復攙和，令行禁止，則因大錢底缺，而銀價太賤，民間日用銷耗實多，若不令行禁止，則一串之中，砂殼薄片，居其大半，民間市物，出入吃虧者多，而私鑄之匪，實獲厚　。查大錢缺乏原因，實係民間器用，除錫瓦竹木之外，銅亦什一，有所消毀，歲必增置，於是銅作因無新銅，以大以錢市銅，故毀錢者相率效尤，以謀倍利，並廢銅而不買也。咸豐初年，順康雍三朝之靑錢，每串尚可得四五十文，常有人在帳櫃中選出同福等廿字，及所謂雞爪關力者，至歲終集而貫之；蓋銅　，奸民尚不計及此也。今則盈千之錢，選之不及四五枚，或竟無之，豈好弄之兒，揀以珍藏乎？未必盡然也。可知毀以鑄器，已銷沒三朝之寶不少矣！</p>
<p>有人倡議，禁民間使用銅器，以鉛錫代之，亦良法也。</p>

<h3>做世界的人　（一）</h3>
<p>如今的世界是在逐漸的縮小。從前的農夫，被田畝隔着不相往來，國度被高山阻斷。不通音問，民族被大海分開不相連繫，所以，那時候的世界，覺得非常之廣大。如今因爲科學進步，把一切都改變了：農夫有了汽車鄕村連成一氣，國家有了鐵道，高山成了平地，各地有了無線電，一個地方的播音，便馬上成了全世界的閒談。因此，今日所有五大洲都成了隣居，所有國家，都好像在一條市街上交易，所有家庭，都交換衣食，交換一切。但從另一方面看，世界也因此變成了一個可怕的世界。以前只能爲害於社會的小小壞人，如今許使世界受到他的威脅。從前的弓箭手，如今許成爲砲手，能打到一百公里之外。從前的强盜，如今許成爲政治領袖，坐在寫字間中，公然偷竊民衆的錢財。一個妬嫉心重的婦人，許置毒于蓄水池內毒害全城的生命。少數本地奸黨，散布于國際間，利用無線電，許掀起世界的風波。一個海盜，如今許成爲王，統率着潛水艇，制一國家的死命。這樣看來，我們現代的人，必須比我們祖先時代的人，減少其貪婪之心，和强橫的精神，否則，科學這樣進步不已，其使人類所受的　壞和災害，必較從前多至千數百倍。記得在兒童時代，有人吿訴我，說太陽是一個在燃燒着的世界，等牠的火烟熄滅，所有地方都變爲黑暗，所有生命都要死亡。（待續）　如欲詳細硏究請函郵箱一二二七號</p>

<h3>培養新道德的標準</h3>
<p>— 程炎泉</p>
<p>蒸汽機發明，使整個世界都爲之改觀。資本主義的怒潮，激盪到了中國，使中國的政治，經濟，敎育，文化，宗敎，以及每個人的心理，意識，道德標準，也都爲之改變。在這樣新舊交織之下，社會上的一切便引起了極大的衝突。到處是擾亂和動盪，到處是糾紛和不安。一般老學究們看不慣，便搖頭太息說：「人心不古，世道日衰！」</p>
<p>自從經了五四運動這塲「浩刦」似的風波，舊倫理和舊的社會觀念在靑年心目中，簡直只是一堆供人踐踏的枯草，最多也不過是一些有洞的刺籬而已。在舊道德被打擊得體無完膚之後，新的道德又不能趕快建立起來前去接防，於是我們立身處世，只有靠自己意志去決定路綫，而沒有一種確切的法則來作我們生活的準繩。可是，人心不同如其面，社會如果沒有了法則，那便要沒有秩序。法律的條文是有限的，最好的法則，常然還要推社會道德，因爲法理也不外是人情。</p>
<p>社會道德旣是這樣的需要，但它　不是一朝一夕所能成立。它並不像法律那樣具體而有條文，它往往是不成文法。它的成化，用不到政府頒布命令，而只是在人類心靈上相互感應。如果大多數的人有了一致的認識，這種道德標準便能在人類心靈上結成一條堅固的長城。所以健全的道德標凖，需要我們逐漸培養。</p>
<p>培養新的道德標準，請大家不要忽視了舊有的道德，這確不是作者的迷戀骸骨而要使陳屍復活，因爲幾千年來祖先成訓所以能够保存而使人奉行，自有它許多客觀的價値。至少，它乃是中國歷史的產物，它具有着中華民族的特性與文化的背景，是不該不分皂白地一概予以抹煞的。其次，西洋的進步的社會倫理，我們也要相當加以採取。這倒並不是沒有目標的媚外，我們的探擇要有我們客觀的立塲。</p>
<p>培養社會道德標準的客觀條件，第一便是合理化。如一般父母往往要强迫子女犧牲目己的意志而作滿足與快意的服從。這種態度，是很需要修改的。而更成問題的，是一般父母固執地要拿不能適應時代與違反人類本性的成見當作天經地義的敎訓，如果子女奉行不背，當然也會　累小淺。如果給子女發覺其錯誤，那反覺得父母嘮叨不休爲面目可憎了。第二，合理以外要求公平。如父不慈與子不孝應受社會相等的譴責，丈夫的納妾與妻子的不貞應受社會同樣的歧視。如果還尤許社會有階級，則上級對下級要仁，下級對上級才能敬。第三，新的道德標準要時代化，要能够適合時代生活的狀態與理想，如「父母在，不遠遊」，這是安定的農村社會裏的道德，在生活複雜的今日已不該存在。第四，新的道德尙須合於今日建國的理想，及世界進步潮流，如「好男不當兵」，「女子回廚房去」等等，都不是應該採擇的。</p>
<p>願大家能明辨是非邪正，利用人類的自尊心和自卑心，多多揚善斥惡，培養良好的倫理和敎訓。</p>
<h3>不吃又不死</h3>
<p>— 劉導鴻</p>
<p>本埠美國新聞播昔名家卡羅亞各脫，前幾天在大陸報上講了這樣的一僩故事：</p>
<p>十月前，有一僩猶太難民自奧國逃到上海。他吿訴一個朋友說，他預備在上海做點生意住下去。這個朋友便問他要經營那一種行業，他很有把握地回答道：「初到一個陌生的地方做生意，最妥當最靠得住的行業是開麵包店或殯儀館。因爲人不能不吃，也必定要死。所以不會沒有生意的。」最近這個朋友又碰到他，問他生意做到怎樣，他却哭喪着臉答道：『糟糕透了。上海眞是個奇怪的地方，許多、買不起麵包；又不願死。』</p>

<h3>煉銅</h3>
<p>— 戴飛</p>
<p>悲觀的詩人將人生比喻爲一個空虛的夢，一個用無數憂傷的絲經，鋪織起來的空虛的夢。然而這不過是徒然的感傷吧了，是不免流入於無病呻吟之途的。一首偉大的詩歌決不單單是許多空幻的字句的閃跳，它須要嘗試過好多眞實中的危艱。它是曾經或正在受着生活（包括一切痛苦與黑暗）磨煉過的發光體。高爾基是完完全全從生活里磨煉過來的，所以他的文學作品有着永存的價値，正如「眞實」的永存　樣。</p>
<p>生活在黑暗境遇中的人們是痛苦的，然而也是幸福的！因爲一切痛苦正都是幸福的苗芽：所受的痛苦越深，所獲的幸福越大，從痛苦里得來的幸福才是眞止的幸福。</p>
<p>所以，在大的幸靦降臨前，一切磨煉都是必然的。在黑白混淆的境界中，唯有自己把握住生活的指針，以免走錯了路向。用理智判斷是非，用熱情鼓動勇氣，借着環境的試騐室，將自己鍜煉成一塊不屈的堅鋼。</p>
<p>心理</p>
<h3>兒童心理診療所</h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>最近報載本市教友派友誼會籌設兒童心理診療所，不日即將成立。該所專從事兒童指導及保護，以期消弭心理病態，改善兒童生活。在充斥着流浪兒童的孤島上，這種工作實在切合當前的需要。</p>
<p>遠在一九一五年，美國赫耐醫生（Dr.　W.　Healy）即認爲要减少犯罪應從研究個人的心理着手，因設兒童精神病院於芝加哥。前此一八九六年本薛維尼亞大學已設心理診療所，但利用科學方法以研究兒童犯罪行爲，却始於赫耐的病院。這病院影響社會極大，對芝加哥兒童法庭貢獻獨多，後來波士頓的法官倍克（Harvey　H.　Baker）也仿效設立精神病院。近年來，麻省及紐約許多醫院，多增添心理診療的工作，全國心理衛生委員會推行尤力。兒童心理診療所的組織，已有由美國推及歐洲各國的趨勢了。</p>
<p>兒童心理診療，是一種很重要的兒童福利事業。在現在複雜的社會中因和環境衝突或不能適應的兒童往往產生行爲失常的狀態。這種心理病症，若不亟早予以治療，會影響終身的幸福。從社會治安說，行爲失常的兒童，常造成種種犯罪事件，足以擾亂社會秩序。所以心理失常的問題兒童需要治療，正如身體衰弱的人需要治療一樣。問題兒童需要治療的原故，乃在他們和社會環境的衝突，感覺適應生活的困難，情緒不穩定，人格欠均衡。這種情形，我們很容易看出。有許多兒童喜歡欺騙，說謊，偷竊，嘲弄他人，虐待家畜，或者性格憂鬱態度傲慢，甚至耽溺畫夢，喜怒無常。一般父母和敎師往往認爲是天性使然，不堪造就。其實这些變態行爲都是有原因的。後天環境的影響，我們決不能忽視。診察所的任務，就在羅致社會工作者，心理學家，精神治療家，以及有經驗的醫師，通力合作，研究兒童心理疾病的原因，確定治療的方案。近代心理衛生的知識，對診療工作幫助尤大，這是因爲診療所的目的和心理衛生的目的同爲促進兒童心理健康。常然診療心理疾病的責任，應由兒童的父母，學校的敎師，法庭和社會團體共同負擔的，診療所是一個綜合聯絡的機關，牠的主要功用在引起社會人士注意兒童失常行爲的防止和變態行爲的矯正。</p>
<p>兒童心理診療所純爲犯罪的，心理變態的，流浪無依的兒童服務，牠需要對精神病學有特殊研究的醫生來主持，又要有精通測騐計量的心理學家予以合作，此外更要有熱忱的社會工作家，分析社會情形。戰前大夏大學心理學會曾創設兒童心理診察所，進行個案研究，惜停頓已久。本市近來旣有這種診療所的籌設，造福社會匪淺，而且又是由精神病學家，心理學家和敎會的社會服務家合力協作，一定會有美滿的成果！</p>
<p>編者按：最近本市中外人士合組的『上海心理衛生促進會』也在九江路同仁醫院創辦『兒童指導診所』，以科學方法幫助各界處理問題兒童及低能兒童，時間是每星期三上午十一時半至下午一時。</p>

<h3>更好的生活</h3>
<p>— 李永運</p>
<p>如果我們可以活得幸福一點，爲什麼我們一定要吃苦呢？如果我們能够有更好的物質享受，幹嗎我們必須拋棄呢？我們努力的目的不正是爲了使我們活得更好一點嗎？</p>
<p>不過，話雖如此說，却並非毫無條件的。重心在視野的遠近。我們反對極少數的人得到幸福，而大多數的人在苦難的泥沼中打滾；我們不贊成幾個人窮侈極慾的享受，而無數的人却在飢餓死亡的邊緣上呻吟。我們厭惡畸形，而企求公平。</p>
<p>可是，如今我們所看到的，完全是我們所不希望的。操縱，壟斷，有己無羣，把自己的幸福建築在別人的痛苦上，醜惡的嘴臉，惡毒的心腸，但這却無妨於我們建立起自己的生活理想，而且更是迫切呢。</p>
<p>斤斤於利祿的追求，單純的物質享受，是很容易使一個人麻木的。雖然，我們不是柏拉圖主義者；可是我們有權利喚醒大家對於精神生活注意的必要。人應該保持他那顆純潔公正的良心。</p>
<p>所以，在如此風浪險惡的環境裏，我們要看準指南針，把準舵，決不能讓生活的船迷失了方向。</p>
<p>我們需要享受，但如果要用卑鄙，汚濁的心去換取，那就該敬謝不敏。而且，我們得記着，應該爭取使大家全活得史好一些。物質享受不好，精神生活愉快，倒是値得的。因爲，我們活得有意義。</p>

<p>㳺藝界</p>
<h3>紀粵劇祭酒李雪芳</h3>
<p>— 遊紀者</p>
<p>粤劇名伶李雪芳脫離紅氍毺的生涯，已經很久，許多年來，自從嫁給一位粤商韋君以後，便一直息影家居，廣州淪陷時，她悄然來滬，正像梅畹華之在香港，一樣不肯輕易在舞台上再露色相了。</p>
<p>最近，上海各界舉行救濟中山難胞慈善播音的時候，雪芳旣以旅滬親友紳商的敦促，再以關懷桑梓災黎的救濟，因此破例與名伶程硯秋同時在新都飯店玻璃電台出現，播音約一小時，成績極佳。</p>
<p>一個藝人的成功當非偶然，雪芳以花旦著稱，但她的長靠武技也有極深造詣，她的「黛玉葬花」，「仕林祭塔」，「曹大家」，「苦中緣」，「碧玉離生」，「陽紅淚」等名作，會風靡過萬千愛好粤劇的觀衆，華南一帶對李雪芳是太熟悉了，然而，在上海也許還很少人知道，雖然，「南李北梅兩芬芳」这榮譽一代的藝林佳話，恐怕也曾遺留在一部分上海人士的心坎裏吧。</p>
<p>據記者所知，雪芳小久將赴香島，原因是爲了港地救濟中山難胞演劇會和籌募上海難婦產科醫院經費，她今年已將近四十歲，不想這位藝人的中年還這樣的活躍藝壇呢。</p>
<h3>李雪芳之劇照</h3>
<h3>銷麟囊觀後（上）</h3>
<p>— 唯我</p>
<p>程硯秋之新戲「鎖麟囊」，巴於上月二十九日開始公演，記者特往一觀，略抒管見如下：</p>
<p>此劇之故事，前在本刊已略有記載，即窮富對照，以及描寫慈善因果，皆頗有力量，整個的劇本，予人以極明澈的印象。不過對於劇中主角薛湘靈的個性，反使人發生疑問，但這並不是硯秋對於薛湘靈的個性不能描摹，實在是受劇情支配。因爲在全劇展開之初，描寫薜湘靈是一個未經世故嬌生慣養的千金小姐，一條洗臉手巾，都要一換再換，換到後來還是因爲不中意而擲在地下，此雖小節，很可以看得出薛湘靈脾氣之壞，虛榮心之大。其他還有小少地方，更吿訴我們，薜湘靈是一位橫弗好豎弗好不易伺候的一位小姐，然而當她出閣的那天，轎到中途，遇大風雨，避於春秋亭，後一轎至，轎中人因貧而嫁又阻於雨，號哭甚哀，湘靈竟表示憐憫，此點似甚勉强。雖然惻隱之心人皆有之，然而因爲前面描寫湘靈的虛榮和脾氣相當過份，在這一塲反而覺得站不住，我的理由是像薛湘靈前段予人的印象，決不會去管一個不相識的窮人的事，甚至於贈以私蓄珠寳之銷麟囊，全劇的　鍵旣是在贈鎖麟囊的這一塲上，不如前面盡量的描寫薛湘靈是一個樂善好施的慈悲女了，這樣對於窮富　照，以及千金小姐怎樣的嬌　慣養，就可以沒有妨碍，而且在全劇以「慈善」二字爲主題，反可以增加力量。</p>
<p>還有湘靈之鎖　囊，係贈與趙守貞父女，守貞之夫盧勝籌，似不知情，　謂勝籌夫婦因有鎖麟　而經商致富，則多少應有交代，愚　未上盧義盧仁前，應加上勝壽夫婦一塲，可由勝籌說明，如何經商致富，如何思念恩人，如何將鎖麟囊朝夕供奉，如何因登州大水恐恩人葬身魚腹，而出巨資設粥棚，廣爲周濟，此等塲面實不可少，同時連塲，勝籌夫婦應同去小樓上香，蓋旣謂朝夕香火，應有香火，而是日所見小樓雖有一案一龕，並無香火，爲盡量發揮勝籌夫婦受恩思報的景况，應當　爲像眞，　更不可少夫婦上香之塲面。雖則　戲中頗多暗塲，（即所謂Understood）然而究要看和劇本所發生的關係如何，設爲經濟時間，則第二塲上老少二儐相，有大段對白，實無意義，可以取消。如果說這段對白是描寫人們的勢利，那麼和後面胡傑程俊的對白又雷同了。還有發大水後上胡婆一場。胡婆有幾句白口也覺得俗氣，最好減為一二句，湘靈伴公子遊嬉一場，剪紙牛紙馬，頗感冷塲，不如直接就是公子擲球誤墜樓下，來得緊張。以上所述，是劇本的編排，而和塲子有影饗的幾點，論意識，是能令人滿意的。</p>
<h3>國產電影之觀感</h3>
<p>— 亦星</p>
<p>有某導演，談其對中國電影之觀感五點：</p>
<p>（一）中國電影上沒有「戰塲」「舞塲」「情塲」。（看過「絕代佳人」……的人，對於第一點必不否認。「舞塲」之尷尬也是周知的事實，「情塲」呢，中國向來是用隻鳥的雙宿雙飛之類的塲回來象徵的。）</p>
<p>（二）中國片人物背後沒有動的「空氣」，即畫面上向來沒有襯托之謂。</p>
<p>（三）中國片以「戲」迫人下淚，（如「漁光曲」「姊妹花」之類），不以「描寫」感人下淚。</p>
<p>（四）外國（通常是指好萊塢）明星的表演母是「恰到好處」，而中國明星的表演則母母「小足」或「過火」。</p>
<p>（五）外國影「眞」先於「美」，中國電影「美」先於「眞」。</p>
<p>記者對該導演的意見認爲大部分尙見確當，但希望其於指摘以後能再發抓若干有建設性的意見。</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Basic Livelihood</h3>
<p>The soaring prices of all goods, coupled with the contraction of foreign exchange, have deepened the difficulties of the people's lives and highlighted the depreciation of the legal tender. The poor fear they have nothing to live on, and the rich fear they will have nothing to sustain themselves. Forced into this situation, the pain is deeply felt, and a sense of unease fills the entire society. This is undeniable and impossible to conceal.</p>
<p>Analyzing the causes, deducing the consequences, seeking fundamental solutions, and devising emergency measures are inexhaustible topics. Although it is said that there is no harm in discussing them, what benefit can come from such discussions? Because this phenomenon is neither limited to one place nor one country. The difficulties in various countries and regions only differ in degree, and the arrival of these difficulties only differs in time. The difficulties felt by residents of Shanghai today are merely more severe and earlier than those in other countries and regions. Recalling the autumn and winter of the year before last (1938), Shanghai's industries flourished, creating a golden age that other places and other days had yet to experience. Less than two years have passed, and unease has replaced prosperity. Not to mention the year before last, even last year, industries were still rejoicing in profits due to the gradual rise in prices. Now, although industries continue to see prices climb, they cannot feel at ease and even feel pessimistic. The main problem lies in the severe shaking and disruption of the original order of the world situation. The shaking and disruption have affected not only warring countries and dangerous zones but also the United States, far across the Pacific, which is currently in a golden age. Even if it maintains neutrality and stays out of the vortex of war, it will eventually suffer terrible losses and pain due to the shaking and disruption of the war. This is the fate already determined for the United States. Looking at the phenomenon in Shanghai, which is like an isolated island, from the perspective of the promising future of the United States, which is unmatched in wealth and power, who can blame heaven or man for the sense of unease felt by residents of Shanghai today? Although life is difficult today, they should still feel at peace! When discussing its future, comparing our reality, perhaps we will hesitate and stammer. But in fact, although Shanghai has soaring prices and difficult living conditions, there are still countless people who admire Shanghai and hope to be residents of Shanghai, which is unattainable. Try to examine the recent newspaper and magazine reports: what is the life of Berlin residents like? What is the life of Tokyo residents like? There is a limited period for eating meat, and there are limited amounts of sugar and salt to be consumed. New clothes and shoes are not allowed to be worn. If one must buy new clothes and shoes, old clothes and shoes must be handed over to the government. Such fragmented reports are readily available. Rice, meat, and white goods are expensive in Shanghai, but in reality, except for those who have no proper way of life when prices are not expensive, if one changes from three meals a day to two, and from three or four bowls per meal to two or three, and from eating with a variety of dishes to plain rice and vegetables, then each person can save a few days' worth of expenses and may be able to taste meat. In short, the life of residents of Shanghai today is not as difficult as that of residents of Berlin and Tokyo. There is no black market for foreign exchange within Japan, and it is illegal to buy foreign exchange privately. The Japanese army is punished with severe penalties. In Shanghai, the black market price of legal tender has plummeted, but Japanese tickets have also fallen in value. Comparing this reality, we can be more calm.</p>
<p>After all, unease is an undeniable reality. The most commonly heard sighs and cries of sorrow are: "Commodity prices are rising, but human value is not rising." The implication is that people are not as valuable as goods, and that human value has fallen with the legal tender. We sympathize with the sincerity and pain of such sorrows and sighs. In fact, this is a limited perspective from one corner of Shanghai, misled by the present moment, and is an absolute illusion. Regarding this fundamental concept, this newspaper briefly explained the legal tender and national wealth of China yesterday, and I will not discuss it again today. I will now discuss it from the perspective of any individual.</p>
<p>In this world-shaking dramatic transformation, this historical dramatic transformation, anyone should know that the value of individual life is originally lower than usual. If life itself is like this, then the question of how to enjoy happiness at present should be put aside. Being able to enjoy a bit of happiness is considered an unexpected stroke of luck. As for hoping for wealth and honor, hoping to cling to the old ways, it is neither appropriate nor allowed by reality. If one vaguely longs for some good dreams of the past, or lingers and cherishes the beautiful scenery of the present, it is a small-minded, selfish, and clever act; it is simply forgetting one's roots and being foolish. Therefore, no one should mistakenly believe that the current difficulties and hardships of life are abnormal, but must recognize that hardship and difficulty are the duty of living in this great era. Recognizing this duty will allow us to understand that material things are not worth valuing, so why dwell on the high or low price of goods, the rise or fall of the legal tender? We do not deny that holding material things and legal tender is a valuable capital for life, but in this great era, whether to cope with reality or to create a future, "people" are the most worthy of attention, the most valuable capital for life. Not only that, but they are also the most reliable capital for life. The heat, intelligence, and physical strength of people have a value that commodity prices cannot compare with, a value that legal tender cannot measure, and a value that foreign exchange cannot affect. Whether to cope with reality or to create a future, we must rely on human power. Whether to enjoy happiness or have a bright future, we must treat human strength as the key ingredient. Buying American dollars and hoarding goods cannot be fully managed, but to the greatest extent possible we can retain and make use of our heat, intelligence, and physical strength, then there is absolutely no risk of failure. Not only that, but one can almost achieve whatever one seeks. If we cannot get what we are looking for, then we must regret that our own heat, intelligence, and physical strength are a little inadequate. To exchange legal tender for American dollars is a loss and painful. If we make use of our heat, intelligence, and physical strength to engage in production, and make good use of this period that favors exports, then we can exchange it for American dollars that we will get more of and can be delighted with. So on and so forth, not just seeking to be delighted. Try to think about prices, try to think about the legal tender, gloomy, distraught, and in a state of unease, is that not fundamentally forgetting that you are an able-bodied "person"? To evaluate the value of people with legal tender is a person who is nothing more than legal tender, and loses the essence of being a person. In this case, it is necessary to use human power to increase the value of the legal tender, only then will you be a person who uses legal tender, or perhaps one who can keep legal tender. Hoping that the legal tender increases in value to improve the value of people is putting the cart before the horse. You should quickly encourage yourself to preserve, increase, and make use of your heat, intelligence, and physical strength. If you have plenty of human power, you will see a rapid surge in production, this is the fundamental plan.</p>
<h3>On the May Fourth Memorial Day, Chen Cheng Publishes "A Letter to Revolutionary Youth," Urging Them to Recognize the Mission of the Times and Complete the Great Cause of Resistance and Reconstruction</h3>
<p>Chongqing. On the "May Fourth" Memorial Day of the 29th year of the Republic of China, Chen Cheng issued a "Letter to Revolutionary Youth," which stated, "The 'May Fourth' Movement has reached its 21st anniversary. Recalling the youth of that time, the patriotic movement promoted a revolution in the entire society's thought and culture, creating a modern Chinese national consciousness of self-reliance and a revolutionary movement striving for liberation. This glorious fact will forever encourage us revolutionary youth to fight to the death with the enemy and strive for the bright future of the entire nation and country. However, social changes and historical progress have made the environment in which we youth find ourselves today completely different from the 'May Fourth' era, and the responsibility that Chinese youth bear for the revolution today is also completely different. Today, we are in an era of resistance and reconstruction. Under the leadership of the great leader Chiang Kai-shek, the people of the entire country are carrying out the war of resistance against Japan, which has laid the foundation for final victory. At the same time, the great cause of revolutionary reconstruction is also progressing step by step. Therefore, the path of struggle for us youth today should be completely different from the past, and the responsibility we bear is also increased simultaneously with the progress of the revolution. Today, on our 'May Fourth' Memorial Day, I would like to sincerely share with my beloved young comrades the mission of the current era and the responsibility of revolutionary youth.</p>
<p>First, we must recognize that the mission of the current era is to seek the completion of the Second National Revolution. To accomplish this historical task, first of all, the youth of the entire country must deeply understand that national unity and national independence are the most basic preconditions for all problems in modern China. Only by achieving unity and independence can we maintain the glorious history of the Chinese nation for five thousand years and create a prosperous and happy new China based on the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, the youth of the entire country must unify their will, concentrate their strength, and absolutely take the interests of the entire nation and country as the premise, and with full awareness and confidence, love our country and nation, and love our brilliant history, to train ourselves and become upright Chinese people.</p>
<p>Second, we must recognize the revolutionary responsibilities of the present and the future. The main revolutionary responsibility of youth lies in the future, not the present, because the revolutionary responsibility of the present is already being shouldered by our elders. The greatest expectation of the country for the youth is to ask the youth to carry on the past and open up the future, continue the legacy of the revolutionary martyrs, and strive for the long-term and arduous cause of national reconstruction. Therefore, the leader instructed us, "The future destiny of China rests on the youth." We must bear the revolutionary responsibilities of the future and live up to the expectations of the country and the leader. Only by burying ourselves in preparation now, striving to enrich our knowledge of national reconstruction and cultivate a strong physique, and paying special attention to the cultivation of production skills, the research of national defense science, and the study of our own history, geography, and culture, can we youth become the necessary talents for national reconstruction and the backbone of national rejuvenation. In addition, what is particularly important for us youth is to cultivate the spirit of loyalty to the party and love for the country, and cultivate a noble and pure personality. Among young comrades, we must love each other like brothers and sisters, share each other's joys and sorrows, unite sincerely, help each other, and have the spirit of promoting love for others, in order to create a moral model for the new youth of China.</p>
<p>Third, we must correctly resolve the suffering of youth themselves. In terms of thought, only believing in the Three Principles of the People is the most correct and revolutionary path. Our country has been able to overcome all difficulties amidst internal and external troubles and defeat the Japanese entirely because it relies on the Kuomintang, which has a great and wise leader. The President of our party has awakened all party comrades and the people of the country to resist foreign aggression and revive the nation. In the past three years, the number of party comrades who have sacrificed in the hail of bullets has reached a total of 110,000. This great and heroic sacrifice is the greatest contribution of the Kuomintang to the nation and the country. Only under the leadership of the Kuomintang, which is the most progressive and the most capable of struggle and sacrifice, can we young comrades seek a way out for the nation and the country, and thus seek a way out for everyone. Secondly, the suffering of youth in life and career will definitely be thoroughly resolved in the victorious process of resisting aggression and building the country, because the difficulties and unemployment that we have experienced in the past and present are due to the various political oppressions and economic aggression of imperialist Japanese warlords against us, as well as the exploitation and destruction caused by domestic warlords, bureaucrats, and reactionary elements. In the future, with the victory of the war of resistance and the success of national reconstruction, all the factors of oppression and exploitation will have been fundamentally eliminated, and we youth can live a free, happy, and happy life. Especially in the process of national reconstruction, the country needs millions of construction talents, and we youth can do our best, contribute to the country, and assume the responsibilities of the backbone of national reconstruction.</p>
<p>Fourth, we youth should have a spirit of self-awareness and increase our own cultivation. This cultivation is to awaken the youth to strive forward, encourage self-reliance and self-improvement, overcome the adverse environment, and eliminate resentment towards society. We know that youth's dissatisfaction with politics and social annoyance are inevitable, but we should seek it within ourselves and from now on resolve to reform politics and reform society, because the future society belongs to us, and those corrupt elements will eventually be destroyed by the wheels of time. What we need to do is to cheer ourselves up and strive to become strong, so that in the future we can create a perfect society from our own selves. If we do not pay attention to this point and simply complain about heaven and blame others, we will inevitably repeat the mistakes of our predecessors. Looking at what happened to the youth who beat Cao Rulin in the "May Fourth" era, this is the experience and evidence before our eyes, which we must take as a warning and do our best. In this way, the future world can be better than the previous generation. Finally, we must understand that the characteristics of the current youth movement are constructive, unified, and active, not destructive or passive. In the past, the youth movement often only had human relationships but no organizational leadership, relying only on emotional impulses and not on rational analysis. Therefore, youth became the tools of speculators, private individuals, or factional struggles, and became useless victims. The reason why the "May Fourth" Movement could not last for a long time was precisely because of the lack of organization and training. Now, since the establishment of the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League, the youth movement has had a clear goal. In the future, the youth of the entire country, under unified organization and training, will each become a youth of the country. Therefore, we must pool our efforts and work together to engage in social service and production construction, and bury ourselves in enriching our knowledge of national reconstruction, using a unified, constructive, and active youth movement to promote social evolution and promote the great cause of revolutionary reconstruction. In short, we youth are in a great era of resistance and reconstruction today. We must understand the historical mission of the era and our own revolutionary responsibilities to work hard to find a way out for the nation and the country. In other words, we must contribute our personal equality and freedom to seek the equality and freedom of the nation and the country. When President Sun Yat-sen went north and bid farewell to the Huangpu students for the last time, he instructed us, "If you want the revolution to succeed, you must first sacrifice your personal freedom and personal equality, and contribute your freedom and equality to the revolutionary party. Only the party has freedom, and individuals cannot be free, so that our revolution can hope to succeed." This testamentary instruction is the most sincere instruction of the President for the youth to revolutionize and save the country. We hope that every young comrade who aspires to revolution will follow this great testamentary instruction and have full preparation from now on, with strong organization and training, to seek a way out for the nation and the country. This way out is definitely not the way out for a few people, but a broad road for 450 million people, the broad road of the revolution of the Three Principles of the People. Young comrades, we are the vanguard of the revolution, we must bravely march forward on the road to the new China of the Three Principles of the People!" (Third Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Kidnapping of Four German Nationals in Peiping</h3>
<p>Peiping. Four German nationals were kidnapped by bandits at Biyun Temple in the Western Hills on a recent holiday. They were later rescued by the Peiping Municipal Police. According to the kidnapped individuals, although four of them were kidnapped at the same time, two of them, namely, Mr. Walser, a staff member of the German Embassy in China, and a woman, were released after being kidnapped for several hours. The bandit leader ordered them to negotiate, demanding a certain amount of sorghum rice, several luminous watches, and 50,000 yuan in cash as the price for redeeming the other person. However, they also hinted that if 50,000 yuan could not be raised, a few hundred yuan would suffice. Another German national who stayed in the bandit's lair, Mr. Herschlup, an employee of Lihe Foreign Firm, presented a luminous watch and a small amount of cash that he had with him to the bandit leader. The bandit leader initially rejected it, claiming it was an individual's private funds. Later, probably because the luminous watch was dazzling, he finally accepted it and was willing to deduct the price of the watch from the ransom. However, before Walser and others could deliver the ransom, the Peiping Municipal Police surrounded the bandit's lair. The bandits retaliated with Mauser pistols and so on, and then fled. The two German hostages were thus rescued. (Dispatch from Havas News Agency on the 2nd)</p>

<p>London. Military sources here recently stated that when British troops withdrew from the port of Andalsnes, some loss of military equipment was unavoidable. As for the German claim of having captured "innumerable spoils," it is unfounded. (Dispatch from Havas News Agency on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden. According to the latest news, Namsos port was again heavily bombed by German planes yesterday, causing many civilian casualties. In the Roros area, German troops have been trying to strengthen their positions yesterday. According to reports from correspondents of various newspapers here, a bridge leading to Roros, which was originally destroyed by Norwegian troops, is now being quickly repaired by the German army in preparation for an offensive. Therefore, the city is likely to be occupied by the German army again. However, the number of German troops currently fighting there is small, only a few hundred infantrymen, armed with rifles and machine guns, and several small armored vehicles for support. In addition, Norwegian troops resisted strongly south of Oslo and retreated after blowing up the bridge over the Glomma River. (Dispatch from Havas News Agency on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden. Yesterday, German planes bombed Namsos eleven times in twelve hours, turning almost all the buildings there into rubble.

<h3>King of Norway Not Leaving the Country - General Headquarters Relocates - Continues to Direct Operations</h3>
<p>London. Well-informed sources here stated that Allied troops are continuing to approach Narvik, but little news has been received in the past two days. According to responsible individuals, the British withdrawal from Andalsnes does not mean abandonment of Norway. The Norwegian government still exists, and the Norwegian King is still in the country. It is now believed that the Norwegian Commander-in-Chief in the Andalsnes area has moved his headquarters elsewhere and is still directing operations from there. Qualified individuals here believe that the technical and military aspects of the withdrawal from Andalsnes have proven a great fact, namely, that since the beginning of the war, this is the first time that British troops have truly encountered fierce fighting. They have fully demonstrated their combat bravery and completed the most difficult military operation, as they were responsible for the rearguard task against an absolutely superior air force. The fact that the Germans did not dare to interfere with the British re-embarkation fully proves that the British must have inflicted extremely heavy blows on them. (Reuters dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden. When British Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech yesterday, he said that the Norwegian war should not be underestimated, but it has not yet reached the settlement stage.

<h3>British House of Commons to Begin Debate on the War Situation Next Tuesday - Prime Minister to Continue to Make Detailed Statements - Current Government Facing a Serious Test</h3>
<p>London. A Reuters reporter in the House of Commons has learned that the situation in Parliament at the end of the week is unlikely to change significantly. All members are awaiting Prime Minister Chamberlain's further statements on Tuesday before beginning the debate on the war situation. Opinions on the latest war situation in Norway are now pouring in from around the world, with some supporting one view and others supporting another. Therefore, it can be said that the public will be increasingly concerned about the debate next week. After listening to the government's general statement on Tuesday, members may ask the government not to propose a Whitsun recess. However, the course of Parliament must be decided after the entire Norwegian war situation is revealed. At next week's meeting, the policies adopted by the government before and after the German invasion of southern Norway will be closely questioned. However, even critics now acknowledge that since the Norwegian government strictly adhered to neutrality before the German invasion, the Allied powers had to respect that neutrality. This was the main obstacle to the rapid arrival of the expeditionary force in Norway. Most opinions seem to be satisfied with the fact that the expeditionary force, which was previously assembled and prepared to go to Finland, has been disbanded due to the rapid change in the Norwegian situation. However, whether this is really the case is likely to be the main question for the government to answer on Tuesday. Members are now discussing various strategic points. Whether this discussion will be limited to army and navy matters, and whether the government's war policies will be attacked, will depend on the government's response on Tuesday. Most cabinet members still believe that they can provide powerful answers to all questions. Others are not so satisfied and are prepared to attack at any time. The opposition party has not yet expressed any opinion and will not take any action to increase the overall situation until the government has clarified everything. The House of Commons debate is expected to last about two days, and the House of Lords will discuss the overall situation on Wednesday. (Reuters dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Berlin Boasts of Victory in Norway</h3>
<p>Berlin. The official review of the war situation in Norway, published here yesterday, declared, "Since the German army began occupying Norway on the morning of April 9, all important Norwegian ports and air force bases have fallen into German hands by nightfall. However, land communications have not been opened up, because the ports are hundreds of kilometers apart and are separated by towering mountains and few usable roads. Although the British High Command understood this situation, the British army has lost the initiative because of the German army's preemptive strike. After the British navy landed in Namsos north of Trondheim and Andalsnes south of Trondheim, British Prime Minister Chamberlain confirmed in the House of Commons on May 2 that the British planned to completely isolate Trondheim and then use a large military force to overcome this important town in central Norway. This counterattack plan by the British against the German landing has been shattered by the German army. At the beginning of last week, the German army in Trondheim began to advance north and occupied Steinkjer, 100 kilometers north of Trondheim. The British army retreated, and the road south of Namsos was blocked by the German army. At the same time, the German air force heavily bombed Namsos, destroying transport ships, docks, barracks, and food warehouses. As a result, the British army has been greatly alarmed by the shortage of food in recent days. Secondly, the British army wanted to land from the south and occupy Trondheim. This attempt was destroyed by the German army's rapid occupation of Stavanger port through Skagerrak. In order to block the German advance, the British army suddenly sent troops to Lillehammer. However, on Monday and Tuesday of this week (i.e., April 29 and 30), the German army severely damaged the British and Norwegian armies and turned the railway hub of Dombas and Storlen into ashes. As a result, the British army was unable to transport troops from Andalsnes to Lillehammer or Trondheim. At the same time, because the air force bases have completely fallen into German hands, the British army is unable to advance to Trondheim from Andalsnes. When the German army advancing from the Oster River valley connects with the troops advancing south of Trondheim, the British army in Andalsnes has only two options: one is to retreat into the sea, and the other is to be completely annihilated. According to Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons yesterday, the British army should take the first route, that is, withdraw from Andalsnes, leaving the German army to occupy central Norway alone."

<h3>German Air Force Attacks British Ships</h3>
<p>Berlin. A communiqué issued by the German High Command stated that the German army had occupied Andalsnes. Yesterday, when German planes attacked the British fleet off the west coast of Norway, a British aircraft carrier was hit by a bomb, and a British destroyer was also hit. Two British fighter planes protecting the British ships were shot down, and one German plane did not return to base. (Reuters dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Italian Newspapers Mock Britain</h3>
<p>Rome. The Italian official news agency's foreign dispatch stated that the Allied withdrawal from Trondheim was "the second Gallipoli." London had said that Germany had made a major strategic mistake and had "missed the bus." However, the Allies in Norway not only missed the late bus, but also lost their luggage.

<h3>Britain and France Mobilize Naval and Land Forces to Strengthen Defenses in the Near East - Fleets of Both Countries Gather in the Eastern Mediterranean - No Less Than a Strong Warning to Italy</h3>

<p>Paris. An unofficial report yesterday said that when Fuehrer Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini met in the Brenner Pass, they mentioned three key points on how Italy should act if it decided to join Germany in the war, and these were studied. Therefore, the possibility of the European war extending to the Mediterranean is more certain. It is understood that Hitler has pointed out that Italy should launch naval and air force attacks in order to divide the Mediterranean into two sections between Sicily and the Italian military base of Pantelleria Island and the narrowest part of Tripoli, and cut off the supply lines between the Allied forces in the Near East and their home countries. At the same time, it will cut off British trade with Mediterranean countries. According to reports from France, Italy has concentrated its main force of 111 submarines and a large fleet of torpedo boats in the strait between Sicily and French Tunisia. There is considerable confidence here that the British and French navies can control most of the Mediterranean, because their naval forces there amount to more than 750,000 tons, while Italy only has 495,000 tons. (Dispatch from United Press on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Rome. British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons yesterday was commented on by political figures here, who said that Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement that the British and French fleets had sailed to Alexandria, Egypt, to further normalize naval power in the Mediterranean, was a statement aimed at Italy, declaring that although the British and French were fighting in the North Sea, the strength of their respective Mediterranean fleets had not been weakened. However, Italy is not moved by this threat. In addition, the exchange of views between U.S. Ambassador Phillips and Prime Minister Mussolini the other day is of great international significance, and the general public here has been deeply impressed.

<p>Situation in the Near East and the Balkans</p>
<h3>Italy Assures the United States that it will Maintain the Status Quo in the Mediterranean</h3>
<p>Washington. The Italian Ambassador to the United States, Collona, had a 15-minute conversation with Undersecretary of State Welles yesterday afternoon, and then called on President Roosevelt. This conversation has aroused great interest. Welles later told people that the State Department had received a detailed report from the U.S. Ambassador to Italy, Phillips, on his meeting with Mussolini on Tuesday, which was of a general nature and exchanged views on the international situation. In view of the above conversation, the State Department seems to believe that Italy does not have the intention of joining the war immediately. Welles declined to comment on Italy's attitude towards the belligerent countries, but he told reporters that the State Department had not considered the issue of warning Americans to leave Italy. It is generally believed that this remark indirectly confirms the news from Rome that Mussolini told the U.S. Ambassador that Italy did not intend to participate in the war. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Washington. According to diplomatic sources, Ambassador Collona provided assurances to President Roosevelt on behalf of Prime Minister Mussolini, declaring that Italy's non-belligerent status had not changed. U.S. Ambassador to Italy Phillips had stated to Prime Minister Mussolini yesterday that the recent situation in the Mediterranean was uneasy and that the U.S. government hoped that it could be eased, otherwise it might have to prohibit American ships from sailing into the Mediterranean. British merchant ships have been ordered to stop passing through the Mediterranean. If the United States follows suit, Italy's source of goods will be scarce, and its economic institutions will inevitably be greatly affected. For this reason, Italy has made the above assurances to the U.S. government. In the view of U.S. political figures, although the situation in the Mediterranean has eased slightly, the U.S. government is still paying great attention to it. (Dispatch from Havas News Agency on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Washington. The Yugoslav Minister to the United States, Fotić, held talks with U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles yesterday.

<h3>Greece Determined to Defend its Territory with All its Strength - Ten Classes of Reserve Officers Conscripted and Trained in Batches</h3>
<p>Athens, Greece. Yesterday was May Day, and Prime Minister General Metaxas delivered a speech in which he said, "Our country's air is already filled with unease and anxiety, because the current European war is perhaps the most terrible in history. Its significance is not only about whether a certain country will expand or lose territory, but also about the civilization of the centuries to come. One thing is reassuring in our country, that is, our country in this European war is completely different from the previous European war. In the past, the country failed to unite, but now it has sufficient strength and is united in spirit. If our country's independence is threatened, we will definitely defend it." (Dispatch from Havas News Agency on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Athens, Greece. Ten classes of reserve officers have been called up for one month of training. They will be enlisted in four batches. The first batch must report on May 15. All junior officers of the highest rank are on the list of those called up. (Reuters dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<p>Athens. The "Estia" newspaper reported that the Greek government's recent conscription of ten classes of reserve officers is not related to the international situation, but is merely a routine call-up for training in accordance with precedent. (Dispatch from Havas News Agency on the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Imminent Crisis: Egypt Intensifies Preparations, Air Defense Drill Advanced, Necessary Measures Taken to Maintain Security</h3>
<p>Cairo: The news that the Allied fleet and auxiliary ships have set sail for Alexandria has been received with great satisfaction throughout Egypt. It is widely believed that this indicates the Allies' closest attention to Egypt's defenses. Yesterday, British Commissioner Lampson, Egyptian Prime Minister Maher, and the heads of the British and Egyptian armies held a meeting, believing that all necessary defensive preparations have been taken and that Egypt is prepared for any eventuality. The anti-aircraft artillery exercise, originally scheduled for May 5th, involving nighttime firing by coastal artillery units and blackout measures, has been advanced to May 7th to avoid interfering with university examinations. A new espionage law stipulating the death penalty for those found guilty of conspiracy and espionage is currently under serious discussion in the Senate. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Cairo: Prime Minister Maher held an important meeting this morning with Defense Minister Harb, British Ambassador Lampson, British garrison commander General Wilson, and a senior Egyptian government official. After the meeting, Defense Minister Harb stated that the discussion focused on various measures to maintain security. In addition, Prime Minister Maher met with officials from the Ministry of Interior to discuss methods of monitoring foreign residents and decided to station an Egyptian army unit within Cairo. Afterwards, he issued a statement saying, "All measures to maintain security have been arranged. Although the current situation is fraught with crisis, it is not imminent. There is no need for excessive panic." The Prime Minister also received Italian Minister Maglione, who subsequently stated that he had not received any instructions from his government indicating an imminent crisis and therefore remained optimistic.

<h3>British Lord Privy Seal: Theories Published, British Troops Concentrated in the Near East Are Solely for Defensive Measures</h3>
<p>London: British Lord Privy Seal Wood stated in a speech yesterday that restoring Norway's freedom is essential to world peace. "We will not rest until Norway is free." Wood also stated that Britain does not threaten the peace of the Mediterranean. Regarding the concentration of British troops in the Near East and Middle East, Wood said that these troops do not seek to threaten any country in Egypt or Palestine but are prepared to undertake any duties that may be required. These troops will be engaged in defending Britain's allies, such as Egypt and Turkey. (Associated Press, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Soviet-Swedish Economic Negotiations Underway, Berlin Envoy Arrives in Stockholm</h3>

Sweden is eager to exchange machinery for petroleum, fats, and other materials that it can no longer obtain from Germany or the Allies. Germany is also in contact with Sweden. It is reported that an envoy dispatched from Berlin has arrived in Stockholm to begin negotiations, with the apparent aim of allaying anxieties in Swedish official and public circles.

<h3>Countries of Southeastern Europe Interdependent, Aspire to Maintain Peace, British Ambassador to Turkey Suddenly Visits Sofia, Yugoslavia Declares No Request for Aid to Romania</h3>
<p>Bucharest: Foreign Minister Gafencu recently told reporters that the peace of the "Danube" region and the Balkan Peninsula is closely linked to the peace of the Mediterranean. If turmoil occurs in one place, it inevitably affects others. Therefore, the countries of Southeastern Europe are interdependent. Having learned from the pain of past bloodshed, they all seek to maintain order and freedom. (Havas, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Reactions to Chamberlain's Remarks</h3>
<p>London: Prime Minister Chamberlain, in his statement to the House of Commons on the state of the Norwegian war, concluded, "I would like to take this opportunity to warn the House and the nation that we do not want Norway to become merely a prologue, nor do we want to be tempted to disperse our forces to the point where our overall strategic position is weakened to a dangerous degree. We know that the enemy has a centralized position, possesses a prepared force ready to strike, and that its attack can be launched with lightning speed in one of many theaters. We also know that the enemy is prepared to invade Holland and Belgium without hesitation, and even to invade the innocent neighboring countries of Southeastern Europe. What they are prepared for may go even further, perhaps a large-scale attack on the Western Front, or a blitzkrieg against Britain. What folly it would be if we were to reveal to the enemy the strategy we plan to defeat them. But we can say that we will not disperse or immobilize our forces to the point where it hinders our freedom of action when an emergency arises. We must seize every opportunity in Norway to inflict heavy blows on the enemy, but we must also not forget the overall strategic advantage that will ultimately prevail. I must reiterate that what I have said is only a temporary, not a final, statement. Certain military operations are in progress, and we cannot disclose anything at this time that would endanger the lives of those engaged in them." (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Strengthening Resolve to Fight</p>
<p>Paris: Opinions here on Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks are mixed. Many say that only the leader of a great power would have the courage to make such a statement, and the Prime Minister's forthrightness is widely praised. The news of the retreat only strengthens the confidence to fight with all our strength. The French know that what Britain and France are most committed to is cutting off Germany's access to Narvik and weakening the German fleet. Now this has been completely successful. As for the war in central and southern Norway, it is considered secondary by Britain and France. The Norwegian war is not over, but it is only one act in a long war, and the final result is undoubtedly certain. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Assessment of British and French Prestige</p>
<p>New York: The "New York Times" details the Allied retreat from Åndalsnes, saying that the abandonment of southern Norway is a blow to Allied prestige and a serious strategic setback. The people of Britain and France must not be overcome by adversity or lose their courage and determination under fire. They can now rely on this to fully strengthen their organization and train themselves in preparation for the greater task ahead. The "New York Herald Tribune" states that it will not be easy for the German army to keep its loot and will have to expend a lot of energy to do so. This energy, used elsewhere, may be more advantageous. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Impact on the London Market</p>
<p>London: Yesterday's report by Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons on the situation in Norway caused the British stock exchange to stagnate today.

Italian 7% bonds, which were originally priced at 90 pounds this year, have now fallen to 48 pounds. The prices of Greek and Bulgarian bonds have also fallen sharply. (Associated Press, 3rd)</p>
<p>Sweden Feels Bitter</p>
<p>Stockholm: This morning, several newspapers here expressed disappointment and regret over the Allied retreat in Norway. "Nychterhets-Tidningen" stated that if Trondheim cannot be captured from the south, it will be even more difficult to capture it from the north. "Svenska Dagbladet" also said that although the British Navy has had victories at Narvik and recently in the Kattegat and Skagerrak, using submarines to attack German troop transports, it still cannot stop the constant transportation of German troops.

<h3>American Chamber of Commerce Requests Government Protection of American Interests in China, U.S. Congress Studies Shanghai Financial Issues</h3>
<p>Washington: The American Chamber of Commerce yesterday resolved to request the U.S. government to continue to oppose Japanese discrimination against American interests in Japanese-occupied areas of China. This proposal was requested by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai and endorsed by chambers of commerce throughout the United States. Washington received the request from the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai a few days ago and immediately listed it as one of the motions to be discussed at the meeting of representatives of the General Chamber of Commerce this week. This proposal is unrelated to the report from the American Report Committee in Shanghai this week to Secretary of State Hull requesting a loan to stabilize China's currency. Officials yesterday did not involve any other criticisms of new loans to China. Congress is currently studying reports of the sharp decline in Shanghai's Chinese national currency exchange rate yesterday. In addition, officials yesterday remained silent on whether the Chongqing government has formally submitted a request for a loan to stabilize the national currency to the U.S. government.

<h3>Canadian Trade Mission Arrives in Japan for Investigation</h3>

The mission is tentatively scheduled to leave Japan on June 3. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3>British Financial News Assesses China's Exchange Market: Speculative Activities Expand, Legal Tender Suffers Adversely</h3>
<p>London: Circles here related to the Far East take the attitude that the recent sharp fall in the price of China's legal tender is an inevitable move. Financial news confidently states that speculative activities unfavorable to legal tender have greatly expanded in recent times, so maintaining the exchange rate of four pence and one-eighth has resulted in a rapid outflow of funds remaining in China's equalization fund. Londoners now believe that the recent weakening of the "free pound" price has encouraged speculative activities unfavorable to the Chinese exchange rate, because the Chinese exchange rate has actually been linked to the pound price in recent years. London bankers say that the issuance of Chinese banknotes will continue to undermine efforts to control and maintain the exchange rate, but the main difficulty is that the value of imports exceeds exports. The price of legal tender fluctuates with China's general foreign trade, and the question of what level its price will reach is now a matter of speculation. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Bucharest Times Comments on the Far East Situation</h3>
<p>London: According to a special report here, the Bucharest Times comments on the Pacific problem, saying that in the current environment, it is difficult to find a policy that satisfies Japan's needs. The Netherlands has expressed clear evidence of sympathy for Japan and is encouraging the European trend of adjusting raw material distribution. However, Japan does not want to wait for the European-initiated principle of adjusting Asia. The trend of Japanese Asian imperialism has controlled Tokyo's public opinion. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>German-Hungarian Business Negotiations Come to an End</h3>
<p>Budapest: Economic circles here recently stated that the talks between Dr. Clodius, Director of the German Foreign Economic Department, and the Hungarian authorities have come to an end. The goals were two-fold: first, to increase the quantity of various Hungarian specialties transported to Germany, according to the general production adjustment plan for the countries of Southeastern Europe; and second, to find ways to transport various fuels produced in Hungary, especially kerosene, to Germany. However, the results of the talks do not seem to have produced any concrete decisions. It has recently been reported that Dr. Clodius intends to return here for another visit, at which time he will certainly make every effort to find a solution. (Havas, 2nd)</p>

<h3>U.S. Naval Expansion Plan Re-submitted for Review, Secretary of War Advocates Strengthening National Defense</h3>
<p>New York: The New York Min Sheng Jiang Tan Bao recently reported that the Senate Naval Affairs Committee has decided to invite various military experts to attend and present their views again regarding the $655 million naval expansion plan. The reason is that since the recent outbreak of the war in Northern Europe, the effectiveness of the German Air Force has proven to be greater than that of the British Navy. U.S. Secretary of the Navy Edison recently stated that the air defense equipment of U.S. warships must be strengthened, and this is the reason. In view of this, the members of the Naval Affairs Committee decided to re-submit the naval expansion plan that had recently been reviewed and passed for discussion. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Washington: Secretary of War Woodring recently stated in a speech that in the past four weeks, people all over the world have witnessed the invasion of Denmark and Norway. What value, then, is there in the non-aggression treaty that Denmark signed with Germany seven months ago? This is indeed doubtful. As far as the United States is concerned, we must maintain an effective and efficient army, and we must maintain adequate national defense so as to absolutely prevent any attempt at aggression. In a word, we must maintain sufficient military strength to ensure that our words are respected by others. We will never allow those who change or divide the map to expand their activities to the Western Hemisphere. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Washington: According to congressional sources, at a closed-door meeting of the Senate Appropriations Committee yesterday, Air Force Commander Major General Arnold gave a speech saying that the United States, based on the lessons learned from the current European war, has made major reforms to the structure of fighter planes. The most important of these are two points: one is to equip them with larger-caliber cannons, and the other is to install bulletproof fuel tanks. Senator Roger then spoke, saying that at a time when the aircraft industry is changing rapidly, the U.S.'s existing military aircraft may no longer meet the needs of war. (Havas News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>Washington: Rear Admiral Stark, Chief of Naval Operations, told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce yesterday that the U.S. Navy's strength is not enough to protect the U.S. in the future with what the U.S. relies on for self-reliance and self-defense. To maintain its navy, fit for the five-five-three ratio of the Washington Naval conditions. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>

<p>Washington: The Senate continued to discuss today Republican Senator Townsend's proposal to prohibit the Treasury Department from purchasing silver abroad. Democratic Senator O'Mahoney gave a speech fiercely opposing it, saying that this case would bankrupt our country's commerce with Mexico, and even our country's relations with its Latin American neighbors would be greatly damaged. The Senate then decided to adjourn the meeting until May 6 to continue the discussion. Townsend told Reuters reporters that although there are many senators who oppose his proposal, he is confident that the results of the discussion will be adopted. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Australia's Air Force Strength Triples</h3>
<p>Melbourne: The Australian Minister for Air announced that Britain will donate three or four hundred Fairey Battle fighter planes and five hundred Avro Anson aircraft to Australia for the needs of the British Imperial Air Force training. This is part of the approximately 3,000 aircraft required for the Australian three-year plan. The Fairey Battle fighter planes are superior to any seaplane carried by warships that can be used to attack Australia, so Australia's air force will be three times stronger than it is now.

<h3>Philippines Restricts Immigration, Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Expresses Regret</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an official statement today expressing regret over the Philippine Congress's enactment of immigration restriction laws and hoping that the Philippine government can take appropriate steps to avoid changing the racial provisions of the current immigration law regarding Japanese entry. It stated briefly that the immigration of Japanese to the Philippines has provided very valuable assistance to the island's economic development. Now that the island's government is implementing new measures without giving due consideration to the Japanese, it is incomprehensible. The Japanese government still hopes that the Philippine government will correct this situation when implementing the new law. A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Japan and the Philippines will hold negotiations to discuss the new immigration law. (Reuter, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Disputes Between American Residents in Tianjin and the Japanese</h3>

The spokesman acknowledged that there have recently been two or three disputes between American residents in Tianjin and the Japanese authorities, but the circumstances were minor. For example, a dispute arose when an American woman refused to get out of her car because she did not follow the instructions of a Japanese sentry. The matter was resolved satisfactorily after the woman herself expressed her apologies to the Japanese officials. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>

<h3>Soviet Cities Hold Red Army Parades, 3,000 Aircraft Participate in Performance, Vladivostok Naval, Land, and Air Force Exercises</h3>
<p>Moscow: On May Day, Soviet cities held large-scale air force parades. In coastal cities, the navy participated. At the same time, the working masses also held large demonstrations after the large parades. 1.8 million people participated in the parade in Moscow, and 500,000 people participated in Kiev. The troop review in Leningrad lasted two hours.

In the parades in various cities, the performance of the Soviet artillery, tanks, and mechanized units was particularly impressive. They fully demonstrated their great power, sophisticated equipment, and uniform pace. This parade fully demonstrated the Soviet military power.

<h3>Finance: Forex Market Still Unsettled, HSBC Quote Reduced Again in the Afternoon, Black Market Sees Unprecedented Tight Prices</h3>
<p>The forex market situation yesterday showed that the HSBC quote did not change after the initial quote at 9:20 AM. However, at 2:30 PM in the afternoon, it suddenly announced an unprecedented tight price. The British pound was quoted at two, and the US dollar was quoted at 4.3125 yuan. Other currencies were also quoted at a reduced rate. As for the domestic market situation, the afternoon market trend was still stable. At the beginning of the market, foreign firms were full of supply intentions, and a certain US firm vigorously sold US dollars for this month's term, which was quite large, and the market once tended to loosen. However, due to the combined closure of Sassoon and Yuli and speculators, the market was unsustainable and tightened. However, before the close, buyers slightly decreased, transactions became clear, and it has stabilized. Who knew that the market would be turbulent and the tight trend would be strong, with speculators buying wildly. Japanese yarn factories were secretly active, and their positions were short, so in the supply and demand gap, a surprisingly tight price was issued. The British gold has broken the tightest price of 3 points, 1875 on August 11 last year, and created 3 points, 09375. The US dollar announced 4.43 5, and people were uneasy. The market situation went beyond the norm.

The spot US dollar once hardened to 4.90625 yuan, and the US dollar for May that the Chinese speculator Nabi American Bank was also 4.75 yuan. The HSBC quote was announced to be unmoved, and the Mountain Bank's balance tax was announced to increase by 2.5 jiao. After that, suddenly due to the foreign firm's settlement being very strong, and Sassoon digging wildly, the price tightened back. It is estimated that the foreign firm sold spot exchange to the foreign firm at 4.875 yuan. The father plugged the US dollar for May to Sassoon, which was soft to 4.6875 to 625. However, with the buying wind slightly killing after 7:30, the transaction decreased, and the market gradually turned flat. By the time of the noon close, the British gold was 3 points, 34375, the US dollar was 4.8125, the British gold for May was 3 points, 21875, and the US dollar was 4.625, which was tighter by 0.0625 and 0.03125 for British and American currencies compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>This Month's British Exchange Entered 3 Points</p>
<p>In the afternoon, an unprecedented tightening drama was re-enacted, and the digging wind had expanded. The price was drastically reduced, and the market was in a state of no market. The Chinese were sucking, the Japanese yarn factory was secretly active, and foreign firms such as Yuli were all in and out. At 2, and a half, the HSBC quote was reduced again, and the transaction price between buyers and sellers was calculated. At first, speculators ate the US dollar for May, which was still 4.5625 yuan. After 3:30, the softest US dollar for May reached 4.25 yuan. The British gold once broke into the 3-point mark, seeing 2 points, 9375.

<h3>People Have Lost Rational Control, Gold Prices Rise Again, Peaking at 7,200 Yuan in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold market situation saw rising winds continue to build momentum, continuing to create a new historical high in gold prices. People have lost rational control at this point and only care about following the advance. Therefore, the entire process saw narrow fluctuations in the morning, and the initial opening was reversed by several tens of yuan. The tense scene started in the afternoon. The foreign exchange market tightened sharply and reached a state of no market. Operators were at a loss for a while, and securities firms and gold firms did not hesitate to search wildly at expensive prices. The price flew out of the 7,000 yuan mark and reached 7,200 yuan. Subsequently, many long positions took profits and quickly returned, and the price fell back to 6,850 yuan in an instant. The difference in ups and downs was often as large as 100 to 200 yuan. People in the market felt quite uneasy and closed the market half an hour early at 6,900 yuan, an increase of 415 yuan compared to the previous day. The total increase in four consecutive days was more than 1,300 yuan. The total transaction was more than 4,000 taels. Gold jewelry in silver shops announced another jump and once saw a high price of 730 yuan. Although it recovered slightly later, the result still rose by 50 yuan. Customs gold and other prices remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Rose by Over 400 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the morning, with each bar (ten taels), the foreign exchange market was loose and flat, and people's hearts were slightly frustrated. There were many sellers at the opening, and the price was immediately reduced by 85 yuan. Silver firms and gold firms had 30 taels, which was 6,400 yuan. Later, silver firms and money exchange businesses took advantage of the low prices, and the exchange market suddenly reported a tightening trend. Retail investors followed suit and made efforts to dig, and soon the price rose by 200 yuan. Silver firms entered gold firms with ten taels, which was 6,600 yuan. However, at that time, there were many sellers with a limit price of 6,600 yuan, and retail investors sold out when they saw the scene. In addition, gold firms, money exchange businesses, and securities firms mutually plugged out, and the price fell back by a small 60 yuan. Securities firms had 30 taels, which was 6,540 yuan. At that time, the money exchange business slightly ate, and the price rose by 20 yuan. The money exchange business entered gold firms with 20 taels, which was 6,560 yuan. Because the foreign exchange market turned flat, it was re-examined by a small 50 yuan. Gold firms did 30 taels with each other, which was 6,510 yuan. Near the close, gold firms suddenly came back in, and the price rose by 55 yuan again. Gold firms entered silver firms with 20 taels, which was 6,565 yuan. After the closing, it was once small by 5 yuan, but gold firms and silver firms dug in, and sellers disappeared, raising the price to 6,590 yuan, and there were no sellers. When the market opened in the afternoon, the morale was even better, and the price jumped by 60 yuan. Silver firms entered gold firms with 20 taels, which was 6,650 yuan. However, at that time, gold firms, silver firms, and others sold out, and the price fell back by 35 yuan. Gold firms made 30 taels with each other, which was 6,615 yuan. Unexpectedly, at this time, the price rose again, and it was said that the exchange market was very tight, and there was no market. People panicked. Securities firms came to buy wildly first, followed by gold firms and money exchange businesses, and although there were floating more profits constantly spit out, the position eventually felt exhausted, and it jumped 585 yuan. Gold firms entered silver firms with 50 taels, which was 7,200 yuan. Later, securities firms suddenly turned from buying to selling, and the exchange market slightly reverted to hard, so they returned to the 7,000 yuan mark. Silver firms exited the money exchange business with 30 taels, which was 6,850 yuan. After entering, the market situation became more chaotic, and the difference between the entry and exit prices was as much as 100 yuan. Therefore, at that time, after discussions among colleagues, it was decided to close the market early, and the price was set at 6,900 yuan. As a result, it rose by 415 yuan compared to the previous day. It has been checked that it has risen for four consecutive days, totaling 1,328 yuan. There were 800 yuan ups and downs throughout the day. After the closing, there were buyers for 7,000 yuan outside the market, but no sellers. The selling price of cash firms was 10 yuan higher according to spot gold, and the receipt was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few open transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold was Listed Above 730 Yuan</p>
<p>The initial price of gold jewelry per tael in silver shops was still 660 yuan for the Datong line. By 9:15, it was raised by 10 yuan, and at 10:53, it returned by 10 yuan. At 12:00, it was re-examined by a big 5 yuan, at 2:00, it continued to rise by 10 yuan, at 2:20, the father was high by 10 yuan, and at 2:40, the parent was high by 10 yuan. At 3:20, it jumped by 35 yuan, and at that time, it created an unprecedented record of 730 yuan since there was a market. At 3:30, it returned by 20 yuan, at 3:38, it continued to return low by 10 yuan, and at 4:15, it was re-hung by 10 yuan. As a result, the total was 50 yuan, and it was estimated that Datong changed the listing to 710 yuan. The new peers were the same as the above price, and the collection was reduced by 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Jump Wildly, Especially in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The foreign currency market situation yesterday saw a slow rise in the morning. US dollar bills retreated at the 20 yuan mark, and British and American gold pounds hovered between 140 and 150 yuan. In the afternoon, there was another amazing change. The black market British exchange rate shrank to 3 pence, 125, and the US exchange rate reached less than 4 yuan, 5 jiao. Gold prices actually found an unprecedented high price of 7,200 yuan. Therefore, the rising wind of British and American gold pounds and gold bills rekindled. US dollar bills once reached 23 yuan, and then slightly retreated to 21 yuan, 5 jiao, a continuation of 1 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong bills followed the dramatic rise in the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate by 2.5 jiao. In addition, foreign currency bills such as French franc bills and Singapore, Dutch, Annam, Robbie, Canadian, Philippine, etc. were also in strong demand, and the market prices rose sharply across the board. Japanese gold bills were also in eager demand, and the price rose by 3 points, with the evening market being 1 yuan, 2 jiao, 9 points. Korean bills were evenly supplied and demanded, and the evening market was still 9 jiao, 8 points, 7 points.</p>
<h3>Securities: Foreign Stocks Rise, Ending a Week of Change, Public Debt Also Sees a Small Rise</h3>
<p>The securities market suddenly saw a rebound yesterday. It is said that this is a general speculative element. At first, they sold public debt and bought gold. Now, they sell gold and buy public debt. They made a lot of profit during a reversal. Therefore, the bond market has set off an unexpected wave. However, the silver root is too tight, and doing gold requires an interest rate of more than 4.5%, so they mostly sell and buy back public debt. The transaction is nothing more than replenishing empty positions. There are very few new long positions. In yesterday's transaction, buyers were dominant in the morning, and sellers were dominant in the afternoon. Lianhe and Lianyi No. 20 and No. 38 had to replenish empty positions sooner or later, and retail investors were mostly still eating in. Hongda, Xieda, Tongshun, Jiufeng, Yitai, Hongkang, etc. mostly flowed out of bank spot, and most of them were cut by long positions. The market price was high and low, but it was still 4 jiao to 8 jiao. More than 800,000 yuan was traded. A simple table is listed below:</p>
<p>In stock trading, 200 shares of Hanyeping were traded at a price of 3 yuan and 7 jiao. Due to the shrinking of foreign exchange rates, stock markets ended a week of many changes under a tidal buying frenzy. This short cycle of trading has left many people with cash in hand at a loss, and even speculators who often think of making big profits with small investments share the same feeling. The instinct of many stock prices is to rise again, but at the close, there was a slight reversal due to the closure of floating positions. I don't know what the exchange market will be like when the new trading in the future month of Monday enters the market. If it is still unchanged in its current state, or even deteriorates further, then the rising wind seen yesterday will only be a prelude to a big rise. As for which industrial stock or rubber stock can get the biggest boost, it is difficult to predict. Before commenting on the general market situation, the following two short messages may be welcome to those who care. Shanghai Enterprise Company is about to increase its capital and add new shares (every two old shares can get three new shares, the issue price of new shares is 5 yuan and 5 jiao). The stock has risen to 7 and a half yuan yesterday, and the issuance matters are generally managed by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. China Real Estate Company will pay a special dividend of 2 yuan. The stock rose to 20 yuan, 75 to buy yesterday, and it seemed very cheap. Shanghai Yeguang, China Reclamation, and British Union stocks were traded the most. Jardine Matheson's rising momentum was very sharp, and yesterday's closing was up 10 yuan compared to the previous closing. Steel stocks also rose to 51 yuan. Kaiping stocks rose from 73 yuan to 76 yuan. Jardine Matheson's stock was traded well, rising to 76 yuan (excluding interest). Xiangtai Lumber Company's stock caused a general scramble due to its announced excellent dividend, and it was difficult to buy a large number of stocks by pulling back to 73 yuan. The rubber stock situation was strong. Few sold shares were almost completely seized after the opening. Few people are willing to transfer these phenomena under the current price, and this phenomenon is especially seen in various superior stocks.</p>
<p>The 38th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of Xiangtai Lumber Co., Ltd. is scheduled to be held on May 24th. After the meeting, a special shareholders' meeting will continue to be held. The last dividend for the year from March 1, 1939 to the end of February 1940 is planned to continue to distribute 4 yuan per share of national currency, and the mid-term dividend will be 6 yuan and 5 jiao in national currency.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Lack of Purchasing Power, Significant Decrease in Consumption</h3>
<p>The previously surging yarn and cloth market saw some calm yesterday. However, speculators remained enthusiastic, frequently entering and exiting the market, keeping busy. Actual transactions, however, were virtually at a standstill because, after the price surge, there was a lack of purchasing power, and consumption significantly decreased. The peak price for May futures reached 1,755 yuan, then fell back to 1,700 yuan. Currently, the yarn market is still fluctuating slightly. Given the large range of price fluctuations, the future is extremely risky.</p>
<p>This morning, the yarn market opened with continued upward momentum from the previous day. Brokers were particularly aggressive in pushing prices higher. The spot price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,720 yuan, a further increase of 60 yuan from the previous day. Subsequently, as foreign exchange rates stabilized and actual sales were sluggish, prices quickly fell to 1,640 yuan, a significant difference of 80 yuan between the high and low. Following this, short positions were covered, and prices rebounded slightly. It is reported that 1,425 bales were traded in half a day. The price for 20-count Double Horse yarn is now up 10 yuan.

<h3>Cotton Prices Reach Extreme Heights, Mills Forced to Halt Operations</h3>
<p>The transaction of raw cotton is extremely scarce. Factories are completely inactive in terms of procurement, with only fellow traders engaging in mutual buying and selling. This is because prices have already reached an extreme height. The current transaction situation of raw cotton is listed below:</p>
<p>Fire Cotton Bale 228.00 Fellow Traders bought 990 bales</p>
<p>Omra 276.50 Also 200 pieces</p>
<p>General Packing 255.00 Also 253 pieces</p>
<p>White Lo Qu 285.00 Also 100 pieces</p>
<p>Mitterling 310.00 316.00 Also 300 pieces</p>
<p>Additional News: Foreign Cotton Market: The New York cotton market was particularly quiet yesterday. Subsequently, due to declining news from Liverpool and some Southern hedging sales, market conditions weakened, and the closing price was lower than the previous day, with near-term contracts down 45 points and long-term contracts down over 10 points. The Indian cotton market saw a sharp drop in the Shanghai exchange rate, leading to a significant reduction in Far East transactions, with an expected drop of six rupees. Egyptian cotton rose over 30 points.</p>
<p>The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai is exceptionally quiet. The Indian cotton shipped earlier was mostly priced in rupees. Because of the recent extreme tightness in credit, there are not many bills of exchange being settled. Therefore, this sharp contraction in exchange rates has caused considerable harm. Those in the trade who hold spot goods cannot find buyers at high prices due to the extreme tightness in credit, but they are unwilling to sell at low prices. Therefore, the current situation is unusually chaotic, with prices but no market. It is difficult to predict what the future will hold. (The market conditions published yesterday were for May 1st; this is attached as a clarification.)</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Fabric Speculators Swarm In</h3>
<p>The cotton cloth market opened steadily this morning. As the prices had risen sharply, actual sales were even more sluggish. The exchange rate stabilized slightly, and there were many who were willing to sell at a discount to the market price to settle their positions, so the market trend turned loose. The market price was lower than the previous day's closing price. However, after noon, upon hearing that the exchange rate had tightened again, people were stimulated, and they changed from selling to buying. The asking price for each white fabric has stabilized slightly, increasing by about five jiao per piece. There were also many who made small additions to the original price. The prices for non-fading fabrics, where the dyes were all of European origin, rose wildly by five to six yuan per piece. The majority of transactions throughout the day were accounted for by fellow traders in this street and outside speculators. In total, there were approximately a thousand futures contracts. Customer sales have not yet improved, but retail sales in the stores in this street have increased sharply because most ticket prices have not yet been raised.</p>
<p>This morning, Dragon Head fine cloth, a type of white cloth from the East, opened at 53.25 yuan per piece for spot goods available at the warehouse. Later, many fellow traders sold off their long positions, and the closing price at noon fell to 52.2 yuan. Unexpectedly, in the afternoon, because the foreign exchange rate contracted again, speculators from outside the industry swarmed in, and the market atmosphere tightened instantly. The price once rose to 55 yuan for spot goods and 57.25 yuan for futures contracts at the closing. People's confidence remained strong, with the current spot price being 54.9 yuan and the current month's futures contract at 57 yuan. Four Gentlemen Serge is currently being offered at 1.585 yuan per yard, with the current month at 1.65 yuan.</p>
<h3>A Chorus of Price Increases: The Plight of Living Becomes Even Harder</h3>
<p>Since the soaring of gold and foreign exchange, rice merchants have taken the opportunity to hoard, offering high prices one after another. Those who usually purchase foreign rice forward are now treating what they have in hand as rare commodities, raising the price by one yuan at once. Floating speculators and small retailers are also stirring up waves, chasing each other. As a result, the market price of Saigon No. 1 reached a peak of 52 yuan. Other types, such as No. 2 Saigon, were quoted at 50 yuan, Fire-hulled at 50 yuan, and Small-hulled at 49 yuan, with price differences of as much as three to four yuan. People could not help but be wary of this. The highest actual selling price for No. 2 Saigon was 49.5 yuan, Fire-hulled 49.5 yuan, and Small-hulled 48.5 yuan. Those who profited took the opportunity to sell at high prices, and the price fell back by half a yuan to one yuan. If the closing price was quiet, it was about 2.5 yuan higher than the previous market. During this surge in foreign rice prices, domestic japonica and glutinous rice prices were also affected and presented an upward trend. Glutinous rice increased by 2 yuan. Kai Li Special Grade was 44 yuan, 43.5 yuan. Common Dan goods in the central market were 42.5 to 40 yuan. It is rumored that there were many secret transactions of japonica rice outside the market, also rising by about 2.5 yuan. Kai Wuxi Special Qing Semi-finished product was 50 yuan. Chang Kun White Japonica was 48-49 yuan. Qing Si Special Thin was 49 yuan. Big Market was 48.5 yuan, 48 yuan. South Port Early Rice Special was 48 yuan, Next was 16.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice prices soared. Prices were raised by two to three yuan in the morning and another two to three yuan in the afternoon, an increase of four to five yuan in a single day. The original package of No. 1 Saigon was quoted from 60 yuan to 61.6 yuan. No. 1 Saigon gradually rose from an opening price of 57.2 yuan to 59.5 yuan in the afternoon. May Saigon rose from 58.5 yuan to 61 yuan. The original package of Siam No. 2 Saigon was priced at 57.5 yuan to 98.5 yuan. Small-hulled spot rice was the most active, opening at 47.8 yuan to 48.3 yuan at the close of the morning market, then rising to 50.05 yuan in the afternoon. The evening market was slightly calmer, down by two or three jiao. The intensity of the price surge was rare and was actually caused by general speculation. Therefore, the total transaction volume of spot rice was 16,000 to 17,000 bags, with actual sales accounting for less than three-tenths. There were also over 700 tons of original packaged rice available on the market.</p>
<p>The oil and bean market opened with instability this morning due to the urgent release of hoarded supplies by floating speculators. The market trend at the close of the morning session showed mixed gains and losses. Unexpectedly, the situation changed suddenly in the afternoon. Due to the rampant price increases across the board, people were shocked, and market prices surged again. As a result, the oil market rose by another one or two yuan, and bean prices continued to rise by 1.3 to 1.4 jiao. Detailed market information is listed in the market price column.</p>
<p>Yesterday, factory prices for flour also increased by three jiao, changed to 13.8 yuan in cash. It is expected that prices will continue to increase by two to three jiao today or Monday. As flour is subject to Japanese and puppet government interference, and there are rumors of controls on the new wheat harvest, old-brand flour from returned shipments is being quoted at prices comparable to factory prices. As a result, prices opened at 13.73 to 13.77 yuan. Other inland flours also require 13.3 to 13.4 yuan. The total volume of transactions is estimated to be over 10,000 bags. Merchants from the Northern Gang showed some interest. The price for Cannon Brand customer shipments also rose from 14.6 yuan to 15 yuan. However, wheat trading remains stagnant, and market prices are being maintained.</p>
<p>The sugar market has not eased since the sharp contraction of foreign exchange. The guild set prices gradually in the morning. The spot price for 24 coarse white sugar at the warehouse was 74 yuan to 73.5 yuan. The initial price for foreign new goods was 73 yuan, then rose to 73.5 yuan, and then remained at 73 yuan. Old goods were 72.5 yuan. The transaction volume was estimated at 1,500 to 1,600 bags. Re-exported goods were 47 yuan for 57 yuan, 484.5 yuan for Taikoo Car White B Mark, 460 yuan for H Mark Car Red, 464 yuan for Dutch Red, and 53 yuan for Re-exported. The price for this factory's Snow White was 474 yuan. As a result, coarse white sugar actually rose by 10 yuan. In the afternoon, upon hearing that the foreign exchange rate had tightened again, sellers raised their prices by several yuan. Until the black market foreign exchange rate eases, there seems to be no sign of prices falling back down. Domestic sugar is also tracking the upward trend. Dongxiang Red was 130 pieces, 53 yuan; Tiao Qing was several dozen baskets, 47 yuan; Diao Qing was 50 bags, 60 yuan, all increasing by about 7 yuan. Gong Ge Red was over a hundred pieces, reaching as high as 61 yuan. It is reported that 2,100 bags of sugar were shipped to Tianjin today.</p>
<p>The coal market immediately suspended trading after the exchange market changed drastically the day before yesterday. Formal trading only resumed yesterday. The price of both anthracite and white coal increased by 30 to 40 yuan. The quoted price for Indian Kalkata anthracite was 300 yuan per ton, Borneo anthracite was 295 yuan per ton, Hongji white coal was 205 yuan, Haifeng white coal was 212 yuan, and Little Zi was 210 yuan. The above prices are for transactions among fellow traders. Retailers add an additional ten or so yuan when selling to customers.</p>
<p>The hardware market has increased by another 20% compared to before, and in some cases even 30%. For example, 200-pound Company Iron is sold for 190 yuan per box, 90-pound Double-Linked Tinplate is quoted at 220 yuan per box, 100-pound Double-Linked Tinplate is 270 yuan, New Iron Wire (No. 16 to No. 20) reached 120 yuan, and Black Iron Billets actually reached over 1,200 yuan. Such chaotic prices are truly rare.</p>
<p>Tea sales to Europe are still difficult to develop because of the lack of space on African mail ships. As for exports, 4,000 pieces were shipped to Tianjin today.</p>

<h3>Promoting the Spirit of the May Fourth Movement, Youth Circles Unite and Strive, Today's Enthusiastic Celebration of Youth Day, Municipal Party Headquarters and Three Youth Groups Issue Declarations, Encouraging Youth to Complete the Great Undertaking of Resistance and Nation-Building</h3>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the May Fourth Movement and has been designated by the Central Government as Youth Day. Youth across the country will hold enthusiastic celebrations today. Although the youth of this city are in a special environment and will not hold celebratory ceremonies, in view of the fact that youth are the pillars of the nation and the vanguard of the people, and that their responsibilities are most important during this time of national crisis, they are determined to strengthen their integrity, invigorate their spirits, strengthen their physique, cultivate their studies, and contribute all their strength to the country and nation in order to win the final victory in the war of resistance. Thus, the revolutionary spirit of the May Fourth Movement will be further promoted and carried forward.</p>
<p>Municipal Standing Committee Announcement to the Youth Circles</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang addresses the youth of Shanghai, stating, "The May Fourth Movement is a victorious memorial festival for the Chinese youth movement. We recall the upright and brilliant denunciation of the traitors by the youth and students at that time, opposing the Twenty-One Demands of Japanese imperialism, striving to refuse to sign the Treaty of Versailles, boycotting Japanese goods, and other fighting spirits, fully expressing their sincere and enthusiastic love for the country and nation. We should understand that the May Fourth Movement in the eighth year of the Republic of China was inspired by the Kuomintang's National Revolution and was able to achieve unprecedented results. We should also understand that the great power of knowledge and youth that can concentrate and firmly believe in the Three Principles of the People is to combat the aggressive policies of Japanese imperialism and all reactionary evil forces. At a time when the Japanese army is rampant in China and puppets are taking the stage, the knowledge and youth must make redoubled efforts to carry forward the spirit of the May Fourth Movement, concentrate their will and strength, unite under the leadership of the Kuomintang and the Supreme Leader Chiang Kai-shek, appreciate the central government's established policy of resisting and building the nation, and destroy the evil forces of the Japanese puppets. Our slogans are: (1) Carry forward the spirit of the May Fourth Movement, (2) Complete the great cause of resisting the war and building the nation, (3) Destroy the evil forces of the Japanese puppets, (4) Support the National Government, (5) Long live the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>The Three Youth Groups Clarify the Significance of the Memorial</p>
<p>The Three Principles of the People Youth League, in commemoration of the "May Fourth", issued a message to the youth, stating that the "May Fourth" movement was an important turning point in the modern history of the Chinese nation. It not only stirred up a surging tide of anger in the ideological and cultural circles, causing epoch-making progress in the ideology and culture of the time, but also alerted and intimidated the political institutions, politicians, and bureaucrats who were not yet clear at the time. They knew that this new ideology and new power had freed them from the shackles of the Manchus.</p>
<p>The Chinese Nation</p>
<p>can no longer be manipulated in disguise by a small number of people. Let us once again uncover the historical traces after "May Fourth" and examine the several tragic incidents caused by our nation's being subjected to violence and humiliation. Which one was not caused by the intellectual youth and students rising up to resist, leading the masses, and resolutely fighting against the oppressors. These</p>
<p>Blood Deeds</p>
<p>for the heroic sacrifice of fighting for the survival of the nation, are deeply imprinted in our minds. All citizens of the Republic of China should unanimously respect and love these youths who uphold the spirit of the "May Fourth" and are enthusiastic about patriotism. Here, we must also solemnly inform the invaders that they should not ignore the "May Fourth" spirit latent in the blood of every Chinese youth. Self-satisfied invaders often</p>
<p>indulge in anger, and are stubbornly tyrannical and oppress at will. They only know that China is weak, but they do not know that the post-revolutionary China, although not perfect in appearance, is far from comparable to the old China in terms of national consciousness and the determination and enthusiasm of the youth. This is because they have not understood the impact of the "May Fourth" student movement on the general intellectual circles and youth groups in China. Before the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, the investigation reports of the staff headquarters and the army of the invaders all said</p>
<p>The National Government</p>
<p>cannot unify China, the soldiers have no national concept, and the revolutionary army cannot completely unify China. Who knew that from the fifteenth to the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, the Republic of China was unified by the revolutionary army of the Three Principles of the People. This was a miscalculation by the invaders. In this war, they thought that they could realize their dream of conquering the entire China by using rapid warfare. This dream was shattered again, and then</p>
<p>Political Offensives</p>
<p>diplomatic offensives, but these offensives have made China's resistance increasingly strong, and the enthusiasm of the people has become more intense. This is another miscalculation by the invaders, and the origin of these errors is because they do not understand that Chinese youth have been baptized by new ideas since the "May Fourth" and have a strong will and boiling blood. The Chinese intellectuals are by no means pedantic and weak. This kind of invaders'</p>
<p>miscalculation, because of national estrangement, has produced such a result. The vast majority of Chinese and youth are conscious and outstanding members. In the strong resistance, the youth have been tempered to be brave and firm. From now on, the youth should carry forward the spirit of the "May Fourth", enhance the awareness of resistance, and give the traitors and false people a merciless blow. This is the practice of national revolution, the completion of historical tasks, and the only purpose of commemorating the "May Fourth" student movement. Shanghai Branch of the Three Youth Groups.</p>
<p>Youth Practice the Movement of Integrity and Shame</p>
<p>More than 70 units of students from major middle schools in this city have automatically responded to the movement of integrity and shame and organized practice groups. In order to seek unified action, the Shanghai Youth Circle Integrity and Shame Movement Committee has been organized. On the occasion of the "May Fourth" commemoration, a message to the students was issued, and a large number of leaflets were printed and distributed to inform the practice groups to mobilize publicity on this day. The original text is briefly recorded as follows: Today we commemorate the "May Fourth". In addition to adhering to the post and striving for sufficient knowledge and ability, we also raise the following points and encourage our youth circles to work together: (1) Carry forward the inherent morality and firmly establish a spiritual fortress. Since the "May Fourth" movement, the new culture has flourished, and China has also roared. However, the general scholars are obsessed with Europeanization and abandoned the inherent essence of China, so there has been no progress in politics for more than 20 years, and foreign aggression has become more and more serious. In fact, we should accept the new culture as much as possible, and at the same time, we should advocate and carry forward the good old morality. Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the foundation of our Chinese culture for thousands of years. Today, evil people are rampant because of the loss of integrity and shame. Therefore, our youth must take propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame as the guide for thought and action, eliminate worries, strengthen our will, and strengthen the defense against temptation and threats with the determination of "white blade can be trampled, and official position can be resigned", so that ghosts and monsters will disappear from our surroundings. (2) Recognize the goal and determine the direction of progress. We must avoid falling in the current great era. First of all, we must distinguish between good and bad and identify right and wrong to determine our own direction of progress. Our youth students in the city have made considerable progress in this work in the past, but from now on, we should recognize the goal and calmly deal with the invasion of conspiracies. (3) Work hard and endure hardship, and practice the movement of thrift. Youth students are in an isolated island, and the environment is such that it is an unfortunate thing, but it is also a rare and glorious opportunity. Because the environment gives us suffering, it also gives us a good place to temper our body and mind and sharpen our will. We must wash away the old habits and practice hard, and cultivate the habits of neatness, cleanliness, simplicity, and frugality in our daily life, eliminate the bad habits of messiness, filth, complexity, and luxury, and practice the extreme thrift and hard work to save the decline of the social economy. In the violent storm, it is stirring on the isolated island. Perverted oppression and cruel destruction are coming one after another. We must maintain justice and resist and struggle under the siege of various corrupt forces to complete the sacred historical mission.</p>
<h3>Yesterday, the Rumors in the City Market Gradually Subsided, the Legal Foreign Exchange Rate Remains Unchanged, the Current Restriction is to Prevent Japanese Puppets from Profiteering, and the Equalization Committee Should Continue to Maintain the Foreign Exchange Market</h3>
<p>After the Chinese government decided to maintain the stability of the monetary system and foreign exchange, the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee and the HSBC Bank, in cooperation with British merchants, secretly tried to maintain the black market of foreign exchange in Shanghai. Therefore, although the black market of foreign exchange in Shanghai was manipulated by Japanese puppets and speculators, the foreign exchange market was still able to stand on the new level. Now, because HSBC Bank has restricted the supply, the prices of British and American foreign exchange have shrunk sharply, the market is chaotic, and people are uneasy. It is heard that the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee has decided to handle the matter according to its past principles. In addition to making every effort to stabilize the legal foreign exchange, it is still the principle to try to maintain the black market of foreign exchange. Various rumors are not credible.</p>
<p>Black Market Foreign Exchange is Appropriately Restricted</p>
<p>The rumors in the foreign exchange and other markets gradually subsided yesterday, and people's hearts were slightly at ease. The HSBC Bank's listing has stabilized and is the same as the previous day, but the actual market has shrunk slightly. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency specially visited the responsible personnel of XX two major banks. According to the discussion, the sharp shrinkage of the foreign exchange black market is due to the suspension of supply from Hong Kong. As for the fund of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, the total amount is 10 million pounds, and it is still very sufficient. In order to maintain the Shanghai foreign exchange black market in the dark market and to prevent the conspiracy of Japanese puppets and the manipulation of speculators, it is necessary to give it considerable restrictions, not to completely stop the supply. How the restriction method is, ordinary people cannot know. It is also heard that the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee will never announce the restriction method.</p>
<p>The Legal Price Will Never Change</p>
<p>Regarding the legal foreign exchange, the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee has decided to maintain it with all its strength, so the legal foreign exchange is still stable and will not change due to the contraction of the foreign exchange black market in Shanghai. The legal foreign exchange rate listed by the Central Bank yesterday morning was one shilling, two pence, and half for British foreign exchange, and thirty yuan for American foreign exchange. For imported goods operated by importers, which are not prohibited from being imported and are necessary for domestic use, they can apply to the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee to purchase legal foreign exchange. At the same time, after the actual settlement of the foreign exchange amount for the export of local goods, they can receive the difference between the legal price and the bank's listing price from the settlement bank with the settlement documents. This proves that the legal foreign exchange has not changed. The government's policy of maintaining the legal foreign exchange has always been the same. The drastic change in the foreign exchange black market has nothing to do with the legal foreign exchange.</p>
<p>The Equalization Fund is Very Sufficient</p>
<p>Regarding the Equalization Fund Committee's equalization fund, the total amount is 10 million pounds. Since its establishment, the amount spent on maintaining foreign exchange and the remaining fund are kept secret by the authorities because it concerns the black market exchange rate. Yesterday, according to a foreign bank inquired by a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency, foreigners guessed that there was still more than one-third of the committee's fund, about 4 million pounds, and there was a saying that the equalization fund would be increased by 5 million pounds, so the power to maintain the legal foreign exchange and the black market foreign exchange is more than enough. Moreover, the financial authorities have long stated their determination to maintain the exchange rate, but the decline in the black market foreign exchange is conducive to the export of Chinese local goods and can prevent the import of luxury goods and non-essential goods from the customs of the occupied areas.</p>
<p>Timely Adjustment is Inevitable</p>
<p>According to the authority of Yu Rongjie, the current contraction of the exchange rate occurred after the establishment of the preparatory committee of the new "Central Bank". It is obvious that it is a step to deal with the pseudo-bank. Because the pseudo-bank has no preparation, it is inevitable to take the hand of the Japanese bank to obtain foreign exchange to fill the preparation. The Japanese bank uses the legal currency it spends on buying foreign exchange as a loan from the Japanese bank to the "New Central Bank". Nearly 8 million US dollars were sold in the last few days of last month. If the government continues to supply indefinitely, it will inevitably be exploited, which is very clear. Moreover, the import surplus in the first quarter of this year was 17 million pounds, which is almost double the 9.9 million pounds in the same period last year, so it must be adjusted.</p>
<p>The Japanese Side Will Suffer a Fatal Blow</p>
<p>The impact of the foreign exchange contraction is that prices have risen, and people's lives are difficult, but the Japanese side has suffered a greater blow. Because its proposed financial plan has been shattered, if it continues to implement foreign exchange arbitrage, it will not be able to overwhelm the legal currency in its occupied area, and it will add a "currency parasitized on the legal currency, which only makes the currency tend to expand and the finance falls into chaos. If it wants to establish a sound currency by itself, it does not have this financial power. It is difficult to advance or retreat. Therefore, the Japanese yen, fresh currency, and "United Bank Notes" circulating in China all rise and fall with the legal currency. The currency itself has no independent value.</p>
<h3>Taking the Opportunity to Raise Prices, Determined to Strictly Prohibit, The Two Concession Authorities Issue Orders, Will Take the Most Severe Sanctions</h3>
<p>The black market exchange rate fell again yesterday, and the price of US dollars rose again. The Public Concession and the French Concession authorities were deeply afraid that speculators would profit from it and make the market more chaotic, so they decided to take appropriate measures to curb the activities of speculators and issued the following notice:</p>
<p>The Municipal Council Notice</p>
<p>The Public Concession Municipal Council issued a notice yesterday, saying that if merchants selling various necessities unreasonably raise the selling prices of the items by using the changes in the exchange rate of the Chinese national currency, the Bureau will prohibit it.</p>
<p>The French Authorities Warn</p>
<p>The French Concession Price Equalization Committee warned that in order to warn, the French Concession authorities will take the most severe sanctions against those who take advantage of the opportunity of changes in the value of Chinese legal currency to illegally raise prices. The French Police Department has been ordered to strictly enforce Article 11 of Order No. 78 of the French Consul General's Office on February 19, 1940. All merchants and people should abide by it. This notice, May 3, 1940.</p>
<p>Prices Soar, Stores are Crowded</p>
<p>It is found that the prices in this city rose sharply yesterday. The price of rice, whether Saigon rice or domestic rice, has been sold for about 50 yuan. All department stores are unprecedentedly crowded with customers. It is generally feared that prices will rise further in the future, and daily necessities must be prepared slightly. But in fact, the market price of all daily necessities has risen since yesterday.</p>
<p>The Rice Market is Dangerous and Attempts to Manipulate</p>
<p>Rice market speculators took advantage of the changes in the exchange market to try to manipulate the price of rice. However, the actual sales appetite is weak, and the market is all speculative trading. Therefore, the price of rice rose and fell three times within two hours after the opening of the rice market yesterday. The market situation was unstable and dangerous. The rice industry groups had previously decided to stop short selling and buying transactions in the market. Now, in the tense situation, they once again warned their colleagues to abide by the market rules and not to have any excessive behavior. In order to prevent non-industry players from using idle funds to participate in speculation and disrupt the rice market, they specifically notified their colleagues that goods transactions should be sold by customers to firms, and firms should sell to stores, and should not violate this regulation.</p>
<p>Coal Balls Actually Increased in Price Again</p>
<p>The market price of coal balls sold by the coal ball factory was decided to be increased by the industry association's joint meeting of manufacturers on the 21st of last month, which once attracted the attention of social figures and the criticism of the media, and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce also sent a letter to stop it, urging them to be careful not to follow the trend and take the overall situation into consideration. However, the industry claimed that the cost was huge and it was difficult to maintain, and they defended the external criticism. However, coal balls are indeed daily necessities that cannot be lacked by the citizens of Shanghai, and the poor and the ordinary people are severely affected. Now, the industry has openly decided to increase the market price again yesterday, citing the sharp contraction of foreign exchange and the increase in cost as reasons. The factory's wholesale price has increased by 23 yuan per ton, and the retail price has been changed to 8 yuan and 5 jiao per dan, which has been implemented since yesterday. According to reliable sources, the bottom of the coal dust is not scarce, and the source is also very smooth. Therefore, the 4 million citizens of the city are eagerly waiting for the authorities to quickly investigate and deal with it, ban illegal transactions, and immediately order the relevant fuel groups to issue strict market trading rules so that speculators cannot show their skills.</p>
<p>Abnormal Prosperity is Coming to an End</p>
<p>The population of Shanghai after the war has become a concentration of refugees from all sides, claiming to be more than 4 million. The exact number is not known due to the lack of formal statistics. It is undoubtedly true that the demand for houses in the two special districts is greater than the supply, and the population has indeed increased compared with before the war. The consumption prosperity of the concession after the war is due to the support of this large population. According to observers, the prices in Shanghai have been rising steadily for the past two years, always in a straight line. The price of rice, coal, and daily necessities have all risen again and again. To this day, most people, especially the wage-earning class, can no longer make a living, and families with many mouths are even more painful. "It is not easy to live in Shanghai", almost everyone has this feeling. According to estimates, under the threat of high prices in Shanghai, the population will soon decrease significantly, and the commercial market will also tend to be depressed. At that time, empty houses will line the streets, just like the phenomenon in the past depression period, and the hoarders who are currently following the trend, as well as unscrupulous merchants, will also be overturned.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Council Vetoed the Issuance of Municipal Charitable Lottery Tickets, Believing that it is Not a Good Policy to Benefit the Public, The Bureau is Determined to Prohibit Gambling</h3>
<p>Regarding the proposal to issue municipal charitable lottery tickets by the Municipal Council, the Board of Directors has discussed it from the ethical, legal, and economic points of view. As a result, it is believed that no matter whether it is of a charitable nature, it is not a good policy to benefit the public and should not be implemented. The biggest reason is the principle problem, because the Bureau is determined to prohibit public gambling. The Annual Meeting of Foreign Taxpayers of this year was also thoroughly explained by the Chairman of the Board, Fan Kelin. This time, the resolution of the majority of directors believed that the prohibition of gambling should be maintained for the sake of public interest.</p>
<p>Legal Arguments</p>
<p>The issuance of municipal lottery tickets has the nature of public gambling. In addition to not being able to implement it in principle and ethically, the Bureau also has major doubts about the legal point. If the Bureau is prepared to issue it, the directors will definitely ask for certificates to ensure that they have not violated the laws of their respective countries. Regarding the matter of certificates, the Bureau's lawyers and legal advisors referred to the legal codes of China, Britain, and the United States, and found that</p>
<p>British Law</p>
<p>stipulates that the issuance of lottery tickets is an improper act. Any British employee of the Bureau who participates in it, or any British director who is the head or initiator of this matter, will be prosecuted. According to</p>
<p>American Law</p>
<p>any American residing in China who operates a gambling house or issues lottery tickets is a criminal act. Furthermore, according to</p>
<p>Article 269 of the Chinese Criminal Law</p>
<p>the issuance of lottery tickets is illegal unless it has been approved by the government in advance. Officials and directors of the respective nationalities who participate in such improper measures will not only be prosecuted publicly, but also be sued privately. In fact, the Bureau has received a letter from a taxpayer, saying that it will use all appropriate legal steps to prevent the issuance of municipal lottery tickets.</p>
<p>The Nature of Lottery Tickets</p>
<p>As for the two types of lottery tickets that the concession has approved for sale, they have also been investigated. This type of lottery ticket has a legitimate and special nature. One is operated by the state and approved by the Chinese government, and the other is approved by the Bureau, for the reason of meeting the needs of the public.</p>
<p>Study of Interests</p>
<p>Some directors believe that the issuance of municipal lottery tickets by the Bureau will damage the financial position and credibility of the concession. As for how much actual benefit can be obtained from the issuance of lottery tickets, it is also questionable. Or it is said that no matter how much revenue is, the Bureau can increase funding for social relief undertakings such as hospitals, shelters, etc., because the current revenue is only enough to meet the necessary expenses. Or it is said that if the Bureau wants to raise funds for relief, there is more than one way, such as levying entertainment tax, etc., and the real needs of the concession's relief work can rely on social figures to provide a continuous supply. The past relief work for refugees is a clear proof, so the Bureau cannot use the reason that the financial resources are limited and it is difficult to cope with the expenditure of social work as a reason for issuing municipal lottery tickets.</p>
<h3>Careless Departure, Negligence Caused Trouble</h3>
<p>Destroyed Three Towed Barges, Japanese Fishing Boat also Injured</p>
<p>The Norwegian merchant ship Taisman, managed by Tienshang Foreign Firm, loaded with more than 5,000 tons of cargo from the United States on the 19th of last month. Because the European war expanded and Norway was attacked by German troops, the ship was forced by British warships to return to Hong Kong near the Dachiquyang sea off Shanghai. The Norwegian ship was allowed to return to Shanghai. The ship returned from Hong Kong on the 27th and berthed at the Gonghexia</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council: Banquet in Honor of Mr. Fessenden, Praising Mr. Fessenden's Achievements During Three Years in Office, Maintaining the Neutrality of the Concession Amid Hardships</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council held a banquet at the Shanghai Club on the evening of the 2nd of this month to entertain the retiring Chairman, Mr. Fessenden. In addition to Mr. Fessenden, those present included the new Chairman, Mr. Cornell, as well as the new and old councilors and senior officials of the Council.</p>
<p>New Chairman Praises the Achievements of the Old Chairman</p>
<p>During the banquet, the new Chairman, Mr. Cornell, rose to speak, saying in brief: "Since the former Chairman, Mr. Fessenden, assumed his heavy responsibilities three years ago, it cannot be denied that they were extremely onerous. Although he has left office, he has not left Shanghai. In the future, he should continue to use his rich experience to assist the Council at any time. When he first took office as Chairman in the spring of 1937, the Shanghai War broke out not long afterward. As a result, the threat to this port was unprecedented. Fortunately, under Mr. Fessenden's guidance, we were able to pass through it safely. After the war, refugees gathered from all directions, and the population increased three to four times compared to before the war. All municipal facilities were affected by this, and the rise in prices, the lack of resources, and the adverse effects caused by the war were unavoidable. Under such circumstances, maintaining the internationality and neutrality of the concession was extremely difficult, but the fact that we were able to get through it safely must be attributed to Mr. Fessenden's effective leadership and dedication to work. There is more than one thing worth remembering about his achievements during his term as Chairman. The most important thing is that he took the lead in resolving the issue of the roads outside the boundary in the western district of Shanghai. He shouldered a heavy responsibility for this negotiation. During the negotiations, his vision was far-reaching and his perseverance was admirable. The draft agreement has now been signed, and detailed methods are still under discussion. It is hoped that a satisfactory solution can be reached soon, paving the way for the peaceful resolution of other issues in the concession in the future. Both publicly and privately, we should express our deep gratitude and praise for Mr. Fessenden's efforts."</p>
<p>Mr. Fessenden Delivers a Speech of Thanks</p>
<p>Mr. Fessenden then rose to give a speech of thanks, saying in brief: "I am honored to be present at this grand occasion tonight. I am very grateful for Mr. Cornell's praise, which is too much for me. As Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, I have only done my duty. The affairs I have handled on weekdays have never exceeded those handled by other councilors, and the success of all matters depends on the collective efforts and cooperation of all colleagues. I regard Shanghai as my second home. All my property and friends are in Shanghai. If Shanghai suffers any adverse effects, I will also suffer adverse effects. Therefore, when I was in office, I always aimed to improve Shanghai. In these eventful times, the concession has been able to maintain its neutrality thanks to the cooperation of all parties. The future of the concession is promising. This year, the board of directors of the Municipal Council has appointed a person with various qualifications as Chairman, which is deeply gratifying. It can be predicted that he will become one of the most successful chairmen in history, and there are many serious issues in the concession that rely on this wise and experienced new chairman to resolve. Among the guests are those who will serve as members of the Economic Committee of the Municipal Council. I sincerely hope that you can submit a concrete report, and also pay attention to how to avoid the council's educational policies, maintain prison funding, tax unregistered land, and make routine foreign currency payments. Finally, I would like to express my deep gratitude for the friendship and cooperation of my colleagues, and for the kindness of being invited to this grand occasion tonight."</p>
<h3>Kunming-Hong Kong Direct Air Route</h3>
<p>Air France Plans to Open the Route Soon</p>
<p>(Special interview by this newspaper) According to information from transportation circles, a direct air route from Kunming to Hong Kong is being planned by Air France and will soon be officially opened. Currently, transportation between Yunnan and Hong Kong relies on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to Haiphong, where passengers transfer to ships. There are also mail planes flying between Kunming and Hanoi, and between Hanoi and Hong Kong. The former is the Yunnan-Hanoi route of China National Aviation Corporation, and the latter is a section of Air France's route and Imperial Airways' Hong Kong-Bangkok route. The schedules of these routes are not connected. If the aforementioned direct air route is realized, transportation between Yunnan and Hong Kong will be more convenient.</p>
<h3>Norwegian Merchant Ships in Shanghai Operating as Usual</h3>
<p>London Management Committee Approved by the King of Norway</p>
<p>News has emerged from the Norwegian Legation in Shanghai that Norwegian merchant ships in Shanghai have been ordered to operate as usual. Their business scope will be the same as before the war expanded to Northern Europe. According to personnel at the Legation, Norwegian shipping companies in London have formed a management committee to handle dispatching responsibilities. It is also reported that the establishment of this committee has been approved by the King of Norway. It is further reported that Norwegian shipping in the Far East will be protected by the navies of Britain and France.</p>
<h3>Japanese Youth Yamamura Arrested by Japanese Military Police, Accused of Defaming Japanese Military Leaders, to Be Tried by Military Tribunal</h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reported that a Japanese man named Yamamura, 31, a former student at Tokyo Imperial University, residing in Shanghai at 17 Haineng Road, was arrested by the Japanese military police on charges of treason and will be tried by a military tribunal. Yamamura is accused of aiding the enemy, leaking military secrets, and fraudulently establishing a cultural education association, obtaining 40,000 Japanese yen. In February, Yamamura printed and distributed a leaflet titled "Declaration of Japan" in China and Japan, severely defaming Japanese politicians and military leaders. In February 1938, Yamamura arrived in Shanghai. In April of the following year, he organized the South Asia Association, claiming that its purpose was to cultivate cultural education activities and investigate the situation in South China. He fraudulently used the names of senior officers of the Japanese Army and members of the House of Peers as chairmen of the association, and fraudulently obtained 40,000 Japanese yen from wealthy Japanese residents in Shanghai to carry out his own plans. Yamamura had previously violated the newspaper law and committed bribery crimes four times.</p>

<h3>Driver Dies Bizarrely in Front of "Yi Lu" in Western Shanghai, No Scars on Body, But a Bloodstain on Back of Clothes</h3>
<p>At around 2 a.m. yesterday morning, a bizarre bloody incident was discovered in front of the "Yi Lu" gambling den at 368 Haig Road in Western Shanghai. The deceased had a large, bright red bloodstain on his clothes, but after examination, there were no wounds on his body. According to a detailed investigation by a Pingming News Agency reporter:</p>
<p>Suddenly Died by the Car</p>
<p>At 2:51 a.m. yesterday morning, Xiang Sheng Automobile Company suddenly received a phone call from the Yi Lu gambling den, stating that a driver had died by a car in front of the company. The company immediately sent someone to investigate and found that the deceased was the driver of the company's car with license plate number 18477. He was immediately sent to the Red Cross, but he had already died. The Red Cross reported this to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. The police station was unable to investigate because the incident occurred in a "bad land" alley.</p>
<p>Legal Tender Beside Elbow</p>
<p>The driver's body was lying on the ground in front of Yi Lu. There was a small plate-sized stain of bright red blood between his upper back and waist. There was a one-yuan legal tender note next to his elbow, and a paper slip with a signed fare and 35 legal tender currency units in his upper pocket. The Xiang Sheng Company stated that, according to the driver's custom, the fares were always placed in the upper shirt pocket. The deceased's fares were placed in the lower pocket, which must have been placed by someone else after his death. Furthermore, when a car arrives at Yi Lu, the porter of the gambling den would usually deliver the fare to the car. The driver does not need to get out of the car. Now that the driver is dead on the ground, it is possible that he was murdered.</p>
<p>General Speculation</p>
<p>The deceased's name was Ding Qingxiang, 43 years old. He was usually honest and didn't fight with anyone. Since this case was neither revenge nor a robbery, and although there were no wounds on his body, it can be speculated from the bloodstain that a major accident must have occurred in his car that the deceased knew about, so he was murdered to silence him.</p>
<h3>Manager of Tiancheng Qianzhuang Kidnapped Yesterday</h3>
<p>At 1:20 p.m. yesterday, a kidnapping occurred near Baker Road and Chengdu Road in the Public Concession. It was later learned that the kidnapped person was Qiu Ruyu, the manager of Tiancheng Qianzhuang at 26 Zhifu Road in Shanghai. Qiu's family lived at 11 Fanyan Lane, Baker Road. At the time, several kidnappers broke into the residence, intimidated with weapons, and dragged Qiu out, putting him into car number 18037 parked on the corner, and sped away. His whereabouts are unknown. Afterwards, the Qiu family reported the information to the police. It was reported that the car was found by the police an hour later and is currently under investigation. It was also reported that the owner of the Qianzhuang was Lu Gengsheng, who was killed in an assassination last month.</p>
<h3>Pirates Who Robbed the Wuling Wheel Sentenced: Six Years of Imprisonment</h3>
<p>The Taikoo Company's Wuling steamer was sailing to Sanhe Port in Qidong County, North Jiangsu Province, on December 1st last year at 3 a.m. to load floral fabrics for Shanghai. Suddenly, 50-60 pirates drove small boats from the port to chase the Wuling Wheel, attempting to rob the fabrics. They carried new weapons. The Russian guard on the Wuling Wheel fired to defend, killing the pirate Zhu Fufu and wounding the pirate Chen Zhengxue (18 years old, from Yawo Sha). The remaining pirates fled the ship and returned to the port on their original boat. The Wuling Wheel brought the two pirates to Shanghai and reported it to the Water Police Station, which then reported it to the French Concession Police Station. Chen was sent to the hospital for treatment, and the corpse of Zhu was sent to the morgue. The Second Special District Court sent personnel to investigate, and after Chen recovered from his injuries, the French Concession Police Station brought him to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and investigation on charges of piracy. Due to jurisdictional issues, the Second Special District Court submitted a request to the Supreme Court to designate the court to accept the trial. Now that the interrogation has been completed, Judge Zhang Minsheng of the First Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court ruled that Chen Zhengxue was sentenced to three years and six months in prison for piracy, five years for attempted murder, and five years for deprivation of civil rights, to be served concurrently for a total of six years. He will be held in custody pending the appeal period.</p>
<h3>Bloodshed on Route Tenant de la Tour: Fan Yongming Shot Dead, Bullet Wound to Neck Proves Fatal, Shooter Escapes Scene</h3>
<p>Fan Yongming, a 24-year-old from Wenzhou, wearing a coffee-colored suit and yellow leather shoes, was riding in a rickshaw pulled by Liu Yongfu, a man from Jiangbei, on Route Tenant de la Tour near the Zhumaocang (Pig Hair Factory) at 11:30 a.m. yesterday when a gunman suddenly fired a shot at him, hitting the upper part of Fan's neck. The bullet penetrated, and Fan bled profusely and was on the verge of death. The rickshaw puller was also knocked to the ground and suffered minor facial abrasions. The shooter had already fled the scene. The patrol police arrived after hearing the gunfire and quickly summoned an ambulance, which took Fan and the rickshaw puller to Tongren Second Hospital for treatment. Fan died soon after due to the severity of his injuries. The rickshaw puller, Liu Yongfu, was taken away for questioning after being bandaged by the doctor. It is reported that Fan was an employee of the so-called Shipping Association. Fan was on his way to a friend's house on Singapore Road for lunch when he was unexpectedly attacked.</p>
<h3>Soochow Rice Relief Campaign Coming to a Close</h3>
<p>The rice relief campaign initiated by Zhang Shuliang, Yan Dao, Wu Zhizhong, and others from Soochow University has been going on for more than a month. Thanks to the voluntary promotional slides and advertisements from major cinemas such as the Great Light and Nanjing, and the broadcasts of fundraising programs by radio stations such as Xindu, all sectors of society have responded and schools have imitated the campaign to help the starving people whose livelihoods are about to be cut off. Therefore, the campaign will be ended early. A meeting was held yesterday afternoon to resolve that the campaign will end on the 5th (Sunday). The money raised will be entrusted to charitable organizations to sell white rice at a reasonable price. With the end approaching, please submit donations to the Landa Hall as soon as possible to facilitate an early end.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping of Huang Qiwu Case</h3>
<p>The Zhabei Police Station previously captured three bandits, including Wang Xiangxian, who kidnapped Huang Qiwu and demanded a ransom.

This is to correct the record.</p>
<h3>Postman Arrested for Delivering Opium</h3>
<p>Ye Yushi, a Chinese detective, and Li Shugui, a Chinese detective supervisor, of the Narcotics Division of the Public Concession General Police Station, recently learned that an opium trafficking organization was using postmen to transport opium. So, at 5 p.m. the day before yesterday, they went to the entrance of Lane 226, Beihai Road, to wait. After a while, a postman named Chen Kuixiang, number 449, arrived carrying two ounces of opium. He was arrested and sent to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division for prosecution yesterday morning. After interrogation by Judge Qian Hong, he was ordered to be detained for sentencing.</p>
<h3>Armed Robber Breaks into Home Late at Night and Chops Japanese Couple</h3>
<p>Doi Keikichi, a 49-year-old Japanese businessman, runs the Isuzu Western-style goods store at 190 Tiantong Road, specializing in civil engineering and construction. He has been making a lot of profit in recent years. Keikichi, his wife, and his son, Kenjiro (23 years old), usually live on the second floor of the store. At 3:30 a.m. the day before yesterday, when it was late and quiet, several men broke into the second floor and chopped the sleeping Keikichi and his wife with axes, injuring their heads, faces, chests, and arms. Blood flowed all over the bed, and they fell unconscious. The perpetrators, seeing that their goal had been achieved, stole 233 yuan in cash from the silver box and fled. Kenjiro discovered the incident, and upon going into his parents' room, saw that his father had died from his injuries, and his mother was barely breathing. He hurriedly reported the incident to the Japanese authorities, who sent the injured person to Fumin Hospital for treatment. It has been reported that a suspect in the case was arrested yesterday.</p>
<h3>Shooting on Rue Cardinal Mercier Last Night: Pimp Shoots Prostitute; Wang Sanyuan Shot in Chest; Motive Suspected to Be Jealousy</h3>
<p>At around 6 p.m. yesterday evening, a violent shooting occurred at 8 Qunyu Lane, 161 Rue Cardinal Mercier in the Public Concession. The victim was Wang Sanyuan, a prostitute, who was shot and seriously injured. The details, as reported by our reporter Liang, are as follows:</p>
<p>Prostitute Yiyuan Thriving Business</p>
<p>Among them was a prostitute named Wang Sanyuan, 17 years old, with dark skin and stunning beauty. She usually solicited customers at the rooftop garden of the Great World, commonly known as "running the company." Because of her youth and beauty, her business was booming. At around 6 p.m. last night, Wang Sanyuan, dressed in her pajamas, was putting on makeup, preparing to go out to receive guests, when suddenly three thugs came to her door.</p>
<p>Shot in Chest, Seriously Injured</p>
<p>One of them immediately pulled out a gun and fired at Yiyuan, hitting her in the chest. The bullet passed through her back. Yiyuan fell to the ground in a pool of blood. The assailant, seeing that his goal had been achieved, left. Her family called the Zhabei Police Station, which dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives armed to the teeth to round up the area, but the assailant had already escaped. Wang Xiaomei and three tailors who were working in the hall were arrested for questioning. The injured person was sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment, her injuries were serious, and her life was in danger. According to a resident who witnessed the incident, both of the assailants were wearing long gowns, and one of them</p>
<p>Motive Suspected to Be Jealousy</p>
<p>had spent the night with Wang Sanyuan at the brothel the night before. In the middle of the night, the two sides suddenly quarreled and made a lot of noise. Wang Xiaomei came out to mediate, saying that they could talk about it tomorrow. Unexpectedly, Sanyuan was assassinated yesterday. Therefore, the motive for the assassination may be jealousy. The police are currently investigating and arresting the assailant.</p>
<h3>Passenger Uses Force to Rob Guide Girl, Qian Wenda Arrested</h3>
<p>Xu Meili, a 22-year-old woman from Haining, is a guide girl at the Dou Pai Xingyue Guide Agency at 759 Jiujiang Road. On the afternoon of the 30th of last month, Xu received a phone call from a man surnamed Min, asking her to go to room 209 of the Jue Lu Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road. Xu went as requested and found four or five men in the room. They told Xu that they were unable to repay their gambling debts, so they asked her to help them. After speaking, one of them stuffed a ball of cotton into Xu's mouth to prevent her from making noise. Xu immediately struggled and tried to snatch Xu's small diamond ring worth 250 yuan and a watch. Xu struggled and spat out the cotton, calling for help. The tea server Wang Yonglai heard the noise and opened the door to check. The men, seeing that they had been exposed, fled. One of them, Qian Wenda (from Suzhou), fled to the entrance of the Jue Lu Hotel, where he was encountered and arrested by Chinese Detective Zhou Zhenxing of the Zhabei Police Station. He was sent to the First Criminal Division of the First Special District Court yesterday. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi prosecuted him for robbery under Article 328 of the law, and requested a postponement for further interrogation of his accomplices. Judge Qian Hongye questioned him and ordered him to be detained pending further interrogation.</p>

<h3>Prohibition of Manufacturing Copper Utensils</h3>
<p>Recently, new copper has been difficult to obtain. The Yunnan mines cannot cover the costs, and transportation is expensive. Furthermore, since the cessation of minting in various provinces, new currency is not being issued, and old coins are scarce. Small coins are also being adulterated, and despite prohibitions, the root cause lies in the shortage of large coins and the low price of silver. The daily consumption of silver by the populace is considerable. If prohibitions were not in place, more than half of a string of coins would be made up of thin, brittle shells, causing losses to the people in their daily transactions, while private casters would reap substantial profits. The real reason for the shortage of large coins is that copper is used extensively in everyday items, second only to tin, tiles, bamboo, and wood. As these items wear out, they must be replaced annually. Consequently, due to the lack of new copper, copper workshops acquire copper by buying large coins, leading to a widespread practice of destroying coins for profit and a reluctance to buy scrap copper. In the early years of the Xianfeng era, a string of Qing coins from the Shunzhi, Kangxi, and Yongzheng reigns could still fetch forty or fifty cash. People would often select coins with the "Tong," "Fu," and other twenty characters, as well as those known as "chicken claw Guan Li," from their accounts at the end of the year and string them together. This was because the value of copper was such that even unscrupulous people did not consider such actions. Today, among a thousand coins, one might find no more than four or five of these coins, or none at all. Is it merely that mischievous children pick them out as treasures to collect? Not necessarily. It is clear that the destruction of coins for casting utensils has consumed a significant amount of the treasures of those three dynasties!</p>
<p>Someone has proposed prohibiting the use of copper utensils by the people, substituting them with lead and tin, which is also a good solution.</p>

<h3>A Person of the World (I)</h3>
<p>The world is gradually shrinking. In the past, farmers were separated by fields and did not interact; countries were blocked by high mountains, preventing communication; and ethnic groups were divided by oceans, hindering connection. Therefore, the world at that time felt vast and expansive. Now, due to scientific progress, everything has changed: farmers have automobiles, connecting villages into one; countries have railways, turning high mountains into plains; and various regions have radio, making news from one place instantly a topic of conversation worldwide. As a result, all five continents today have become neighbors, all countries seem to be trading on a single street, and all families exchange food, clothing, and everything else. However, from another perspective, the world has also become a terrifying place. Small villains who could only harm society in the past can now threaten the world. Archers of old can now become artillerymen, capable of hitting targets a hundred kilometers away. Robbers of the past can now become political leaders, sitting in offices and openly stealing the people's money. A jealous woman can poison a reservoir, harming the lives of the entire city. A few local traitors, scattered internationally, can use radio to stir up global turmoil. A pirate can now become a king, commanding submarines and controlling the fate of a nation. In this light, we modern people must reduce our greed and arrogance compared to our ancestors; otherwise, with such rapid scientific progress, the harm and disasters inflicted upon humanity will be a thousand times greater than before. I remember being told as a child that the sun is a burning world, and when its flames are extinguished, all places will become dark, and all life will cease. (To be continued).

<p>Thoughts</p>
<h3>Cultivating New Moral Standards</h3>
<p>— Cheng Yanquan</p>
<p>The invention of the steam engine has transformed the entire world. The surge of capitalism has swept into China, changing China's politics, economy, education, culture, religion, and even the psychology, consciousness, and moral standards of every individual. In this intersection of old and new, great conflicts have arisen in society. Everywhere there is turmoil and unrest, everywhere there are disputes and unease. Old scholars, unable to accept this, shake their heads and sigh, "People's hearts are not what they used to be, and the world is declining!"</p>
<p>After the "cataclysmic" upheaval of the May Fourth Movement, old ethics and old social concepts were simply piles of trampled weeds in the eyes of young people, or at most, some leaky fences. After the old morality was thoroughly discredited, new morality could not be quickly established to take its place. Thus, we rely only on our own will to determine our path in life, without a clear set of rules to guide our lives. However, people's minds differ as do their faces, and if society lacks rules, it will lack order. The articles of law are limited, and the best rules are naturally those of social morality, because legal principles are nothing more than human sentiments.</p>
<p>Social morality is thus necessary, but it cannot be established overnight. It is not as concrete and codified as law; it is often unwritten law. Its formation does not require government orders, but rather mutual resonance in the human spirit. If the majority of people have a consensus, this moral standard can form a solid Great Wall in the human spirit. Therefore, sound moral standards need to be gradually cultivated.</p>
<p>In cultivating new moral standards, please do not ignore the old morality. This is certainly not because the author is infatuated with skeletons and wants to revive corpses. Over thousands of years, ancestral teachings have been preserved and followed because they have many objective values. At the very least, they are products of Chinese history, possessing the characteristics of the Chinese nation and its cultural background, and should not be indiscriminately dismissed. Secondly, we should also adopt advanced social ethics from the West to a considerable extent. This is not aimless flattery of foreigners; our selection must be based on our objective standpoint.</p>
<p>The first objective condition for cultivating social moral standards is rationalization. For example, parents often force their children to sacrifice their own will and obey in order to satisfy their own desires. This attitude needs to be modified. Even more problematic is that parents stubbornly insist on taking views that cannot adapt to the times and violate human nature as heavenly doctrines. If children follow them without question, they will naturally suffer endless troubles. If children discover their mistakes, they will find their parents' nagging tiresome and hateful. Secondly, in addition to rationality, fairness is required. For example, unkind fathers and unfilial sons should be equally condemned by society, and husbands who take concubines and wives who are unfaithful should be equally discriminated against by society. If social classes are still permitted, then superiors must be benevolent to subordinates, and subordinates can then respect superiors. Thirdly, new moral standards must be adapted to the times, able to suit the state and ideals of modern life. For example, "While parents are alive, one should not travel far," which is a morality of a stable rural society, should no longer exist in today's complex life. Fourthly, new morality must conform to the ideals of national construction and the trend of world progress. For example, "Good men should not be soldiers" and "Women should return to the kitchen" are not principles that should be adopted.</p>
<p>I hope that everyone can distinguish between right and wrong, good and evil, and use human pride and inferiority to promote good and condemn evil, cultivating good ethics and teachings.</p>
<h3>Not Eating and Not Dying</h3>
<p>— Liu Daohong</p>
<p>Mr. Carlo Argot, a famous announcer for American news in this city, told the following story in the Mainland News a few days ago:</p>
<p>Ten months ago, a Jewish refugee fled from Austria to Shanghai. He told a friend that he planned to do some business in Shanghai and live there. The friend asked him what kind of business he wanted to run, and he replied confidently, "When you first arrive in a strange place, the safest and most reliable businesses are bakeries and funeral parlors. Because people cannot live without eating, and they are sure to die. So there will always be business." Recently, this friend ran into him again and asked how his business was going. He replied with a mournful face, "Terrible. Shanghai is a strange place; many people cannot afford bread; and they don't want to die."</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Thoughts</p>
<h3>Refining Copper</h3>
<p>— Dai Fei</p>
<p>Pessimistic poets compare life to an empty dream, a dream woven from countless strands of sorrow. But this is merely futile sentimentality, inevitably leading to pointless moaning. A great poem is never simply a flashing of many empty words; it must have experienced many real dangers. It is a luminous body that has been, or is being, tempered by life (including all its pain and darkness). Gorky was completely tempered by life, so his literary works have lasting value, just like the lasting quality of "truth."</p>
<p>People living in dark circumstances are in pain, but they are also fortunate! Because all pain is precisely the budding of happiness: the deeper the pain suffered, the greater the happiness gained. The happiness gained from pain is true happiness.</p>
<p>Therefore, before great good fortune arrives, all tempering is inevitable. In a world where black and white are confused, only you can grasp the compass of life to avoid going astray. Use reason to judge right and wrong, use passion to inspire courage, and use the environment as a laboratory to forge yourself into an unyielding steel.</p>
<p>Psychology</p>
<h3>Child Psychological Clinic</h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>Recently, it was reported that the Friends of the Quakers in this city are preparing to establish a child psychological clinic, which will soon be established. The clinic specializes in child guidance and protection, aiming to eliminate psychological disorders and improve children's lives. On an island full of homeless children, this work is really in line with the current needs.</p>
<p>As early as 1915, Dr. W. Healy in the United States believed that to reduce crime, one should start by studying individual psychology, so he established a children's mental hospital in Chicago. Prior to this, the University of Pennsylvania had established a psychological clinic in 1896, but the use of scientific methods to study children's criminal behavior began with Healy's hospital. This hospital had a great impact on society and made unique contributions to the Chicago Children's Court. Later, Judge Harvey H. Baker of Boston also imitated the establishment of a mental hospital. In recent years, many hospitals in Massachusetts and New York have added psychological counseling services, and the National Committee for Mental Hygiene is promoting them vigorously. The organization of children's psychological clinics has tended to spread from the United States to various European countries.</p>
<p>Child psychological counseling is a very important child welfare undertaking. In today's complex society, children who conflict with their environment or cannot adapt often develop behavioral disorders. If these psychological problems are not treated early, they will affect lifelong happiness. From the perspective of social security, children with behavioral disorders often cause various criminal events that are sufficient to disrupt social order. Therefore, problematic children with psychological disorders need treatment, just as people with physical weakness need treatment. The reason why problematic children need treatment is that they conflict with the social environment, feel difficulty in adapting to life, have unstable emotions, and lack balanced personality. This situation is easy for us to see. Many children like to cheat, lie, steal, mock others, abuse domestic animals, or have depressed personalities, arrogant attitudes, or even indulge in daydreams, and are capricious. Generally, parents and teachers often think that it is innate and cannot be created. In fact, these abnormal behaviors all have reasons. We must not ignore the influence of the acquired environment. The task of the clinic is to recruit social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, and experienced doctors to work together to study the causes of children's mental illnesses and determine treatment plans. Modern psychological hygiene knowledge is especially helpful for counseling, because the purpose of the clinic and the purpose of psychological hygiene are both to promote children's mental health. Naturally, the responsibility for treating psychological illnesses should be borne jointly by children's parents, school teachers, courts, and social organizations. The clinic is a comprehensive liaison organization, and its main function is to draw the attention of social persons to the prevention of children's aberrant behavior and the correction of deviant behavior.</p>
<p>The children's psychological clinic serves purely criminal, psychologically abnormal, and homeless children. It needs doctors who have special research on psychiatry to preside over it, and it also needs the cooperation of psychologists who are proficient in measurement tests. In addition, there must be enthusiastic social workers to analyze the social situation. Before the war, the Psychological Society of Datong University had established a children's psychological clinic to conduct case studies, but it has been suspended for a long time. The establishment of such a clinic in this city recently has benefited society immensely, and because it is co-operated by psychiatrists, psychologists, and social service workers of the church, it will surely have satisfactory results!</p>
<p>Editor's note: Recently, the "Shanghai Mental Hygiene Promotion Association," which is composed of Chinese and foreign people in this city, has also established a "Children's Guidance Clinic" in Tongren Hospital on Jiujiang Road, to help all walks of life deal with problematic children and mentally retarded children in a scientific way. The time is every Wednesday from 11:30 AM to 1:00 PM.</p>

<h3>A Better Life</h3>
<p>— Li Yongyun</p>
<p>If we can live a little happier, why must we suffer? If we can have better material enjoyment, why must we abandon it? Isn't the purpose of our efforts to make us live a better life?</p>
<p>However, having said that, it is not without conditions. The focus is on the distance of the horizon. We oppose the situation where a very small number of people are happy, while the majority of people wallow in the quagmire of suffering; we do not agree with the extravagant enjoyment of a few people, while countless people are groaning on the brink of starvation and death. We abhor deformity and seek fairness.</p>
<p>However, what we see now is exactly what we do not want to see. Manipulation, monopoly, self-interest, building one's own happiness on the suffering of others, ugly faces, and vicious hearts, but this does not prevent us from establishing our own life ideals, and it is even more urgent.</p>
<p>Obsessive pursuit of fame and wealth and simple material enjoyment can easily numb a person. Although we are not Platonists, we have the right to awaken everyone to the necessity of paying attention to spiritual life. People should maintain their pure and just conscience.</p>
<p>Therefore, in such a turbulent and dangerous environment, we must see the compass clearly and hold the rudder firmly, and we must never let the ship of life lose its direction.</p>
<p>We need to enjoy, but if we have to exchange it with despicable and filthy hearts, then we should respectfully decline. Moreover, we must remember that we should strive to make everyone live a better life. If material enjoyment is not good, but spiritual life is pleasant, then it is worth it. Because we live a meaningful life.</p>

<h3>A Record of Li Xuefang, the Elder Statesman of Cantonese Opera</h3>
<p>— Traveling Reporter</p>
<p>The famous Cantonese opera actress Li Xuefang has been away from the red carpet stage for a long time. For many years, since marrying a Cantonese businessman, Wei Jun, she has been living at home in seclusion. When Guangzhou fell, she quietly came to Shanghai, just like Mei Wan-hua in Hong Kong, unwilling to easily show her face on the stage again.</p>
<p>Recently, when all circles in Shanghai held a charity broadcast to aid the victims of the Zhongshan disaster, Xuefang was urged by relatives, friends, gentry, and merchants in Shanghai and was also concerned about the relief of her homeland's disaster victims. Therefore, she made an exception and appeared on the glass radio station of the New Asia Hotel at the same time as the famous actress Cheng Yanqiu, broadcasting for about an hour, with excellent results.</p>
<p>The success of an artist is by no means accidental. Xuefang is known for her Hua Dan (young female) roles, but she also has deep attainments in Changkao martial arts. Her famous works, such as "Daiyu Burying Flowers," "Shilin Sacrificing the Pagoda," "Cao Dajia," "Bitter Fate," "Green Jade Leaving Life," and "Yang Honglei," have captivated thousands of Cantonese opera lovers. Li Xuefang is very familiar in South China, but perhaps few people in Shanghai know about her. However, the beautiful story of "Southern Li and Northern Mei, two fragrant flowers" may have remained in the hearts of some people in Shanghai.</p>
<p>According to the reporter, Xuefang will soon go to Hong Kong Island because of the Hong Kong theatrical performance to relieve the victims of the Zhongshan disaster and to raise funds for the Shanghai Difficult Women's Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital. She is almost forty years old this year, and she did not expect that this artist's middle age is still so active in the art world.</p>
<h3>Li Xuefang's Still Photos</h3>
<h3>After Watching "Suo Lin Nang" (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Only Me</p>
<p>Cheng Yanqiu's new play "Suo Lin Nang" began its performance on the 29th of last month. The reporter went to watch it and briefly expressed his humble opinions as follows:</p>
<p>The story of this play, as previously recorded in this publication, is quite powerful in its contrast between rich and poor, as well as in its depiction of charitable karma. The entire script gives people a very clear impression. However, the personality of the protagonist, Xue Xiangling, makes people question it, but this is not because Yanqiu cannot portray Xue Xiangling's personality, but because he is subject to the plot. Because at the beginning of the play, Xue Xiangling is described as an inexperienced, pampered young lady. Even a face towel has to be changed again and again, and in the end, it is thrown on the ground because she does not like it. Although this is a small detail, it can be seen that Xue Xiangling has a bad temper and a great sense of vanity. There are also a few other places that tell us that Xue Xiangling is a difficult lady to serve. However, on the day she got married, the sedan encountered a heavy storm halfway through, and they took refuge in the Chunqiu Pavilion. Later, another sedan arrived, and the person in the sedan cried sadly because she was poor and married and was blocked by the rain. Xiangling actually expressed pity, which seemed very reluctant. Although everyone has compassion, because the description of Xiangling's vanity and temper in the previous section was quite excessive, this scene feels untenable. My reason is that Xue Xiangling's previous impression would never care about the affairs of an unknown poor person, and even give away her private savings, the "Suo Lin Nang" of jewelry. Since the key to the whole play lies in this scene of giving away the Suo Lin Nang, it is better to describe Xue Xiangling as a charitable and benevolent woman as much as possible in the previous part. This would not hinder the contrast between rich and poor, as well as how pampered a young lady is, and it can increase the strength of the entire play with the theme of "charity."</p>
<p>Also, Xiangling's Suo Lin Nang was given to Zhao Shouzhen and his daughter. Shouzhen's husband, Lu Shengchou, seems to be unaware of the situation. It is said that the Shengchou couple became rich through business because of the Suo Lin Nang, so there should be some explanation. Before Fool Yi and Fool Ren went up, there should be a scene with the Shengshou couple, in which Shengchou explains how they became rich through business, how they missed their benefactor, how they worshiped the Suo Lin Nang day and night, and how they set up a porridge shed at great expense due to the Dengzhou flood, fearing that the benefactor was buried in the belly of the fish, and provided extensive relief. Such scenes are essential. At the same time, in a continuous scene, the Shengchou couple should go to the small building to offer incense, because since it is said to be incense day and night, there should be incense, but the small building seen on that day, although there was a table and a niche, there was no incense. In order to fully develop the Shengchou couple's gratitude for the grace, it should be done realistically, and the scene of the couple offering incense is even more indispensable. Although there are many dark scenes in the play (the so-called Understood), it still depends on how it is related to the script. If it is to save time, then in the second scene, the old and young matchmakers have a long dialogue, which is meaningless and can be cancelled. If it is said that this dialogue describes people's snobbery, then it is similar to the dialogue between Hu Jie and Cheng Jun later on. There is also a scene of Mother Hu after the flood. A few of Mother Hu's colloquial words also feel vulgar, and it is best to reduce them to one or two sentences. In the scene where Xiangling accompanies the young master to play, the paper-cut cows and paper horses feel cold, so it is better to have the young master directly throw the ball and accidentally fall downstairs, which would be more tense. The above-mentioned points are about the arrangement of the script, and a few points that affect the stage. In terms of consciousness, it is satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Domestic Films</h3>
<p>— Yixing</p>
<p>A certain director talked about his five points of view on Chinese films:</p>
<p>(1) There is no "battlefield," "ballroom," or "love scene" in Chinese films. (Those who have seen "Absolute Beauty"... must not deny the first point. The awkwardness of the "ballroom" is also well known, and the "love scene" has always been symbolized by a pair of birds flying together in China.)</p>
<p>(2) There is no moving "air" behind the characters in Chinese films, that is, there is no such thing as a background on the screen.</p>
<p>(3) Chinese films force people to tears with "drama" (such as "Fisherman's Song" and "Sister Flowers"), not with "depiction."</p>
<p>(4) The performances of foreign (usually referring to Hollywood) stars are all "just right," while the performances of Chinese stars are either "insufficient" or "over the top."</p>
<p>(5) Foreign films emphasize "truth" before "beauty," while Chinese films emphasize "beauty" before "truth."</p>
<p>The reporter believes that most of the director's opinions are still accurate, but hopes that he can provide some constructive opinions after criticizing.</p>
