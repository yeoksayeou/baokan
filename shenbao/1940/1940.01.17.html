<p>歐洲西綫戰爭，隨着冬季到來而更見凝凍氣象；然則會不會因春季的到來而生氣蓬勃，大規模的展開呢？英國上議院議員米爾納勳爵推測「今後三月內，希特勒即當興傾國之師，向西綫進攻，藉以衝破英法兩國之陣綫，在必要時即使襲擊各中立國，亦所不惜………」這種推測，惟有等候事實來證明其準確與否；目前的事實，祗是雙方尙未從事於決戰，而仍逗留於僵持階段。原來消耗了大量軍火兵力，爭奪一二堅强據點，爲古今中外的兵家所不取；無故英法宣佈三年戰爭計劃，決定用長期封鎖，困弱德國，使其在經濟上宣告崩潰，達不戰而勝的目的；同時德國也宣佈五年戰爭計劃，以潛艇政策來對付英法的海軍封鎖計劃，並企圖以戈林的四年計劃，增强國內的經濟力量及吸收東南歐各國的物資，以與英法長期作戰。可見雙方都不願冒絕大犧牲，打一塲勝仗，所爭乃在整個戰爭的最後勝利。檢討雙方實情，就經濟言之，德國當然不及協約國來得豐厚；海上軍事封鎖，是對於德國的一大威脅，使德國資源必然受到相當影響；不過因爲德國有東南歐各小國的接濟，蘇聯的援助，在短時期英法難收預期的效果。所謂德國『在三數月內，如不獲勝利，即將無法自救』；這不是愚味的詛咒，便是謬誤的觀察。再就軍略言之，德國在西綫的戰術，最可能獲勝者，即所謂『閃電戰爭』，德國在波蘭戰爭中，此項戰術，收效甚宏；蓋挾雷霆萬鈞之力，作迅雷不及掩耳之舉，（一）使波蘭不及完成其動員計劃，波蘭軍隊不及集中於理想的據點；（二）德國有三千架的飛機，對付波蘭三百六十架飛機，自綽有餘裕，希特勒遂得計劃的一舉而殲毀之。但希特勒在東戰塲的收穫，並不能適用於西戰塲；因爲英法的空軍，在戰爭初期，至少亦與德國勢均力敵，經過了些時日，英法更得盡量補充，長足進步；而德國在東綫的戰爭，又予法國一個從容準備一般軍備的機會，當德國興高采烈，奏凱於波蘭的時候，法國軍隊早已分佈各要隘，決非德國所得輕易襲取了。至於德軍進犯中立國如荷比等圖，以求直逼英法軍隊的側面，爭取決定的勝利；這在去年十一月間，早已如此喧騰遐邇，可是一直到現在，還是密雲不雨，未見發動。雖則這樣僵持的局面，斷無長此不變之理，而將來何時變化，如何變化，也難於揣測，不過就短時期講，德國倘無幾分勝算，決不孤注一擲；故在最近將來，西綫不會發生怎樣驚人之舉，而若干中立鄰邦，如荷比等國，也不難暫時保持他們的中立。</p>
<p>近日荷比緊張之際，復有一說，謂德國聲東擊西。姿態是襲擊荷比，而眞意在於一鼓而下中南歐洲。原來巴爾幹各國，不久也許要捲入戰爭漩渦。各大國對這些國家，早已發動政治攻勢。西歐民主國家的主要目的，在於希望巴爾幹各國成立多瑙河集團，保持中立，使那些有野心的大國，無從挿足於其間；不過這一計劃，大體殆已歸於失敗。巴爾幹各國各有其欲求的，而各有其親疎恩怨；雖至目前爲止，尙不能斷言於其友敵分野之已十分確定，也不能斷言於其所傾嚮的一成不變，但巴爾幹各國之不成爲堅强完整的對德壁壘，這是顯見者一；巴爾幹各國間，隱伏着內在與外來的兩重危機，這是顯見者二。惟其有此危機，雖不能謂德國聲東擊西，意在一鼓而下中南歐，舉動即在目前，然乘機而發，則隨時隨地有其可能。不但如此，巴爾幹原來是歐洲的火藥庫，導火綫不一而足，夙昔爲各國政治家眼光集中的焦點，又是野心家逐鹿的塲所，也是軍事上最易攻陷的一環；荷比雖是蕞爾小邦，然比較巴爾幹，則荷比情况堅實穩定而單純；兩者相較，則隨着春天的到來，隨着戰爭的開展，而首先捲入了戰爭的漩渦，連保持中立而不可能的，也許不在西綫，不一定是目前最見緊張的荷比吧！</p>

<h3 id="c19">有田外相　披露政見　外交採自主立塲　調整對各國關係 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>東京　新任外相有田八郎、十六日接見新聞記者、闡明外交根本方針、即外相謂新內閣之外交方針、如米內相所聲明以處理中國事變爲主要目的、同時由自主立塲調整第三國關係、日本毅然站立於自主的立塲、決無與第三國之一方保持友誼關係、而與其他一方發生、敵對關係等事、却能與列國應各個之立塲與必要、惟持友誼關係、在此種意味之國交調整、實可適合外交本義、</p>
<p>對美關係</p>
<p>日本對美關係、因余尙未熟知最近情形、未便詳述意見、然對美根本方針、自當繼承前內閣之方針、即爲重建日美問傳統的親善關係起見、先使兩國關係正常化、通商條約之善後對策即爲此前提工作也、開放長江完全係日本由自主立塲實行者、現正進行準備實現開放、世人如想起平沼內閣當時已經決定開放長江之根本方針事、則必能明瞭日本之自主的立塲、又關於在華日美關係之諸懸案須應解決者、必須次第解決、余深信如美國方面以正當目光觀察日本如此公正態度、則必以建設的精神、與日合作調整兩國關係也、</p>
<p>對蘇關係</p>
<p>日本訂立防共協定時、余曾爲其當事人、因此或有關於對蘇外交抱杞憂者、亦未可知、然日本政府之方針、本以防共協定與日蘇友誼關係作爲別個問題、想到廣田內閣當時防共協定成立之後、日蘇兩國政府關於劃正國界處理紛爭問題、盡量進行談判之事、則能諒解日本態度、不幸其後兩國　係一時惡化、然至最近、此種不幸原因已經消滅、而恢復友誼精神、不勝欣幸之至、今後亦擬以兩國關係之正常化爲目標、繼續努力解決諸懸案、劃定國界時實爲極困難之問題、然日蘇兩國若以本問題疏通友誼精神、則其可得勝於不侵犯條約數倍之效果也、</p>
<p>對英關係</p>
<p>余曾在平沼內閣當時進行對英交涉、故深信英國覺醒而改善日英關係之期不在遠、</p>
<p>對德義關係</p>
<p>日德義防共協定現仍存在、日本與德義兩國之友誼關係毫無變更、余擬於將來更進一步、增　對德義關係、如有人認日本接近蘇聯、則阻害對德意之友誼關係、此種人爲不　日本自主立塲之外行外交家也、（十六日同盟電）</p>

<h3 id="c52">台杯賽今年是否舉行　澳洲躊躇不決　　憶向國際發草地網球會請示　情形與第一次歐戰時不同 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>（倫敦十五日路透社電）台維斯盃旣經澳洲去年奪得、今年是否照常舉行比賽、在澳洲方面、正急切欲求明瞭、蓋澳洲旣爲目　該盃之保待國、今年之比賽、應歸其管理、指定代表、處理歐美帶比賽、參加國家須於一月三十一日之前、向　報名、抽簽則往例於二月三日舉行，澳洲草地網球會最近曾開會討論、在戰事期內、應否停止比賽、結果決定命駐倫敦代表立刻向國際草地網球會請示如何辦理、</p>
<p>雖因戰事而使澳洲之地位、甚爲困難、但如澳洲表示今年台維斯盃停止舉行、則其理由亦不甚充足、因去年參加之二十七國中、十八國並未捲入漩渦、美國亦未曾參戰、情形與一九一四年完全不同、當時除美國外、皆已加入戰團、是以澳洲必須答覆之問題爲今年此賽是否舉行、抑放棄獲得之銀盃、但無論如何、澳洲將感覺困難萬分、去年擊敗美國之兩大將勃朗威治及奎斯脫、即將加入戰事訓練、管理霍普曼亦不久即將入營訓練、但澳洲祇須參加却令治賽、屆時或可設法出塲比賽也、</p>

<p>時間—下午六時。</p>
<p>人物—王家嫂嫂，張家姆媽，阿巧格娘，　孫老頭，阿巧。</p>
<p>怖景—一個普通的客堂間。</p>
<p>（開幕時—王家嫂嫂，張家姆媽，阿巧格　娘，孫老頭四個人在又麻雀。）</p>
<p>王　阿巧格娘，你的女兒，在前天吧，我親眼　看見她與一個穿西裝的小伙子，擁得緊緊地　在大馬路上走二…形狀眞醜！</p>
<p>阿巧娘　（緊接地，有事無事地）誰管得了她，　爺死後，倒幸虧她在掙錢，女孩子長了終是　人家的，隨她去吧。（手中接到了一張好脾　，嘴巴角上就露出了微笑）</p>
<p>孫　目前的確，女子比男囝容易賺錢！我的大　兒子算算書也讀過靠十年，却還不能够與我　老頭子比，整日整夜，只知道軋女朋友，花　錢請客，結些酒肉之交，要他正經地去找些　生意做做吧，却是這樣不會，那樣又不會。</p>
<p>張　（聚精會神地在又麻雀，對旁人所說的話　，好像都沒聽見）孫老頭，快些又，都是你　，話說得長長地，八圈麻雀，你瞧，整整地　已花了四個鐘頭啦（接着去看看頭錢已抽了　多少，看看香烟還吸賸幾枝…）　孫　（不服氣地）我不是要又麻雀的！張家姆媽　你得知道。你們不是說三缺一嗎？我本來領　孩子，燒小菜，忙得透不過氣來呢！</p>
<p>王·張·阿巧娘　（異口同聲地）孫家嫂嫂又病　了嗎？</p>
<p>孫　我討着這只貨色，眞是貼本錢，想孩子想　得三日兩頭病，病費也不知已經花了多少了　。這幾天的神經病越來越小像樣了，打人，　駡人，踢人，眞是無所不爲。可是孩子不爭　氣，叫我這副老骨頭怎麼辦法呢？</p>
<p>阿巧娘　年紀一大，就巴望孩子了，像我不是　嗎？要是沒阿巧的話，眞不知道又是那副局　面呢。</p>
<p>（阿巧穿得紅紅綠綠地衝了進來）</p>
<p>阿巧　媽，中筒開趙天聲，你打什麼？我要出　去啦，家里沒人照顧。（拔脚就想走）</p>
<p>阿巧娘　啊！趙…慢些呀，阿囝，…天哪，我　昨晚夢見…趙天聲嗎？…八元錢，八元…</p>
<p>（眼睛糢糊了，桌上的牌已經不能認淸。）</p>
<p>阿巧　媽，怎樣啦！（隨手）噢，這裏是十元錢　，挪了去作賭本吧…還有，我要對你說，今　晚有些兒事情，或許要明天早晨天亮才回來　…（說完就跑了出去）</p>
<p>阿巧媽　十元錢，今天的麻雀也有了着落了。　哈哈，哈哈（大笑）</p>
<p>孫·王·張　（也大笑）哈哈，哈哈，哈哈哈…</p>

<h3 id="c111">平齊讀畫記 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>星期日無事，因友人的介紹，到平齋腐廬去讀畫。</p>
<p>平齋朱鏡波先生是收藏家，同時也是畫家，與馮超然，吳湖帆，王勝之，葉恭綽等都是畫友，朝夕過從，鑒賞名畫法帖，此中興趣，使我門外漢甚爲羨慕。承他的情，把他所藏的名人書畫，一一取出，不厭煩的展開給我欣賞。</p>
<p>首先看到的是牆上掛着的，鏡屛「湖大春色圖」，這是馮超然臨吳愙齋所藏的吳漁山本，此圖曾臨十日，方始完成。鄕村景色，使我憶起初到靑暘的印象，也是這樣的長堤，也是這樣的楊柳和小動物，不禁爲之神往。</p>
<p>接着便看他所藏的字畫。有一幅宋畫院的「江南春曉」，是很長的手卷，裏面有童子對奕，村牛囓草，漁翁撒網，驛馬傳信等景，中間峯巒突出，保持了左右的平衡，構圖甚好。詞人鄭文焯題辭云，此畫雖無題款，但宋畫院中人是以不題名爲多的，他門寗願做無名的畫家，把名字寫在岩石問，不願給人知道；如此看來，更可看出此畫作者的高人逸致了。明代趙左的山水卷尤長，一路卷着看過去，眞有如詩句所云：「山窮水盡疑無路。柳暗花明又一村。」心曠神怡，爲之大快。明嘉靖間陸治的山閣圖絹畫也極古樸可愛。</p>
<p>近人書畫特別引起我注意的是吳昌碩任伯年的畫和沈寐叟的字。吳昌碩的屛條四幅，如松如梅如菊，都是耐寒的花樹，淸風峻節，我很喜愛。尤愛菊花一幅的題辭云：「若與淵明談往事，不堪重憶義熙年。」這兩句話的意味是多未的深長呵。任伯年所繪是晋書家王義之的側影，他的童子伏在他的身旁，岸旁有鵝，筆法和題材都是我所喜歡的。沈寐叟的字（近人陳柱學他）有如假山怪石，可說是圖畫一般的字，大有奇趣。末附朱彊邨的題辭，也頗使我愛玩。</p>
<p>此外吳秋農的一幅茅亭聽松，用朱竹垞詩意，亦不同凡俗。陸廉夫的菓品，顏色之艷，各果彷彿有露滴出。吳平齋的畫冊，以石壁歸帆一幅構圖為最好。在峭壁下著一孤舟，安排極爲妥帖。還爲高邕和楊峴的字，鄭慕康的仕女，消初蔡松原的沒骨靑綠山水，顧雪坡的山水册，眞是琳琅滿目，美不勝收。</p>
<p>朱鏡波自己的小幅山水，淸秀淡麗，也許他自己並不在意，我很喜歡。他的「月波樓花卉畫册」，我喜歡他的「林梢睡雀」的詩趣，梅花的勻稱，燕柳的疏朗和荷花的奇恣。吳梅的題辭云：「卿自用卿法，寫心還寫神。鵝溪三百幅，點筆要求君。」打趣得妙！</p>
<p>聽說十七日到十九日平齊主人將在大新公司舉行平齋古今書畫展覽會，屆時倒要去看看，因爲現在我所看的，不過是其中的一小部分，已經給了我很多的欣悅，不久能盡窺平齋所藏，當更爲一大快事也。</p>

<p>第十九回　看花賞月活動成家　種玉孕珠娠妊有術</p>
<p>何家兩位小姐父想與林建成談談建造廠屋的事。今天是他結婚的日子，想他很忙，不能把這種事與他細談。但是到了婚後呢？何小姐又怕他們要去作蜜月旅行。他們都吿了一個月的假，這一旅行，不知幾時纔回來。雖然建造廠屋的事，也不是立刻就興築起來，在自由村要劃地塡基種種手續，一面也等建築師相度地勢，繪起圖樣來。然而人總是性急的，在何家兩位小姐之意，最好是在自由村空地上，立刻湧現出一座廠屋來。明天與江老伯接洽後，領到股款，便可以着手建築廠屋，頂好就請林建成到自由村去看看。可是他們的蜜月旅行，又是人生最歡愉的事，未能加以阻擋。只不知他們旅行到什麽時候回來？後來一問吳君素，知道他們當夜並不作蜜月旅行，她們纔放了心。吳君素又給她們出主意，吿訴她們：「這一對新婚夫婦，雖然當夜並不作蜜月旅行，而過幾天却要給蘇理雅太太試乘家庭旅行車，旅游各地。還約着姊妹們同乘此車，她必定也要來的你咧。你何不與愛人姊商量，在他們新婚旅行時，順路到自由村去灣一灣，那末就可以使林工程師相度地勢，打起樣來，也胸有成竹咧。」何儷玉道：「這法子很好。他們旣不是當天晚上就出去作蜜月旅行，我們明後天就可與他們商量。借着旅行的時候，便可以到自由村去一看了。到了下午三點鐘時候，萬國大飯店的賀客，漸漸的多起來了。這些賀客中，各國的人都有，而尤其是美國，英國，法國的人爲多。美英兩國的人，是蘇理雅太太的朋友，和余澹雲自己的朋友比較爲多。法國人，是林建成的朋友較多，因爲林建成曾經留學法國過的。原來國民政府國民外交委員會統屬下所派的嚮導員，也分出好幾種地域。譬如在亞洲的幾國，有亞洲國來賓的嚮導員；在歐美的幾國，有歌美國來賓的嚮導員。再在亞洲，歐洲，美洲之間，另外分出人來。如印度，日本，菲列賓，蘇聯，土耳其，南美各國，大概先要能說那一國的言語，方能當那一國人的嚮導員。不然，言語不通，情意便隔閡了。正是：</p>
<p>莫道五洲司戶牖　須知四海皆弟兄</p>

<h3 id="c113">滴滴在心頭 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— 常方</p>
<p>上海熟水業司業公會因發現季建明及非同業郁黎陽等假借熟水業名義，擅自登報漲價，於前日召開緊急會議，以再度漲價攸關全體市民生計，一致通過不再漲價。</p>
<p>熟水一分二杓，與每杓二十文，粗看起來，每杓僅漲價五文，在白米售價四十元一擔之際，這區區之數，不致如何應響市民生計；但是每天早上祇生燒一餐飯時間的煤球爐就熄滅，其他午飯晚飯用熟水泡了吃下去，上海最多數的市民正過着這種生活。他們的生活已降低了，即使喝一口水也要撙節的程度，熟水每杓漲價五文，在他們喝的時候，怎不也如冰水一樣，要感到「滴滴在心頭」呢？</p>
<p>所以熱水業的忍痛營業，確實令人欽佩。但是煤價飛漲，也是事實，到了「忍」無可「忍」的時候又怎樣呢？因之，主要的任務不是「忍痛營業」，而在「抑平物價」。五文之微的熟水，已應響多數市民的生計，况四十元一担的白米乎？</p>

<h3 id="c115">花旦泰斗田桂鳳 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— 燕五</p>
<p>遜清光緒末葉，堪為花旦祭酒者，當推田桂鳳。田字桐秋，藝名小桂鳳。其作戲以浪漫細膩爲人所歡迎。如：烏龍院，關王廟，拾玉鐲，戲鳳，也是齋，賣餑餑，小過年等劇，胥爲其拿手傑作。今小翠花每演烏龍院，其念白中之揷科打諢，多爲田所遺。如：常劇中宋江責閻婆惜時，曾有「盡也未曾掛，地也未曾掃……麽樣兒啊」而閻則答以「一根筷子吃藕，又挑了眼啦。」及宋又資以「宋大爺還求曾坐下……；難道你輕慢你宋大爺不成？」閻則復答曰「力笨趕車，又翻了。」蓋彼時故都運輸煤斤，悉用騾馬所拉之兩輪大車，且又未興建馬路，地面凹凸不平，執鞭者，偶一不愼，即有翻車之處。」「力笨一故都土語，謂人之有力而無智者。遜淸某一曾試年，田與譚鑫培二人出演故都崇文門外之廣興園。是日，田演壓軸—即倒第二鴻鸞禧，譚演大軸—即倒第一失街亭。詎田演畢，觀衆多粉紛散去，所留者已寥寥無幾。反之，田演大軸，譚演壓軸，則觀衆皆寂靜不譁，無一先離座而去者。蓋是時臺下看客，多數爲赴京會試之舉子。對於譚之藝術並不能完全領略，而對田之丯姿，做表，念白則無不爲之傾倒萬分也。致　晚年會作男唱不過田桂鳳，女唱不過劉喜奎之嘆。當時捧田最力者，乃慈禧太后之第一寵臣九門提督兼大學士榮祿，榮染有阿芙蓉癖，田每晚必往榮府爲之打烟。積久，亦隨之而染是癖矣，致色嗓俱敗。不得已，乃專致力於「做」，故其每劇之作工，無一不臻化境。田旣與榮極相得，則凡有求於榮者，得田一言，無不立即生效。彼時榮正炙手可熱，於是一般熱中宦途者，知有田之捷徑，無不深夜紛往田處，懷苞苴以求先容。惟田性貧，尤好古玩，以是其收藏甚富。田對藝術，亦具有一般名伶之通病，絕不肯輕授於人，生平僅收男女徒二人，男爲尙小雲，女爲雲飄香而已。</p>
<h3 id="c116">「陳圓圓」觀後 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>「陳圓圓」共分五幕。爲了篇幅關係，這里祇略述一點觀後的私見。全劇的重心在二四兩幕，第三幕是介紹李闖這人物。這三幕戲作爲「吳三桂傳」是已足够的了；第一五兩幕戲的添加，大概是爲了劇名是「陳圓圓」的緣故。</p>
<p>在導演上，第一幕田國丈宴請吳三桂，在亭中的時間太久，又因光綫黯淡，遮蔽了演員的表情，因之非常沉悶。我以爲在他們三人主要的對白完了之後，然後入座；入座也祇應個景兒，即介紹陳圓圓出塲。陳圓圓的兩次唱曲，也應更動地位，最好第二次採用舞唱的形式，這樣更可以與吳三桂的感情互相呼應。第三幕吳三桂衡入李闖宮內，擊劍塲面，非常勉强。而且在情理上講，旣已衝破城門，不會吳三桂單獨衝人宮內的，也更沒有充裕的時間使吳三桂與李闖有兩次爭鬥。我以爲吳三桂與李闖小必見面，李闖中箭之後，就挾陳圓圓　走，留著吳三桂與他的父親相見。以吳襄責子收塲，同樣可以收到良好的效果。第四幕是全劇中最成功的一幕，陳圓圓的痛利害；祖大壽的陰謀敗露；吳三桂的後悔不及，處處能够激動觀衆。第五幕以楊娥的激昂陪襯吳三桂的「下塲」，是作者的苦心所在，不過在開幕時三個宮人的敘述吳三桂晚年縱情聲色，我以為不妨與陳圓圓同時出塲，或者使楊娥等先出塲，這樣可以減少舞臺上過份的冷落。</p>
<p>嚴俊的吳三桂，果然不夠英武，但和過去的西門慶比較起來，有進步的，如二四兩幕都能控制情感的衝突矛盾。夏霞的陳圓圓，第四幕較第一幕好，第五幕的消沉，被楊娥等的戲遮蔽了。祖大壽是全劇的關鍵人物，現在的那位演員，不够狀出「說客」的詐而險，且他的動作跳動，流於文明戲化，希望能隨時克制，改正。</p>

<p>一代尤物北平李麗，去年歲尾，應藝華公司之邀，來滬撮古裝片「碧雲宮」，時李麗因香港尙有藝專未了，故曾言明不能久留，爲此藝華公司之「碧雲宮」一片，關於李麗所有鏡頭，儘先趕拍，先後計費時一月，連　十八個通夜，李麗對此項工作，却亦甚見興趣，每逢通夜拍片，藝華主人即　贈「張裕白蘭地」一瓶，以消長我，其厚待李麗，可以想見。聞李麗在「碧州雲宮」中演出極見精彩，良以李麗第一次演古裝片，全神貫注，故有此成就，該片業定十八日夜九時起，在滬光獻映。</p>

<p>Fancheng: On the 15th, at dawn, the Chinese troops in South Hubei, from Fancheng, launched a two-pronged attack on the Japanese troops in Daye. Around 7 a.m., the vanguard approached the outside of the south gate and engaged in a fierce hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese troops, killing over 800 Japanese soldiers and seizing a large number of weapons and ammunition. A portion of the Chinese troops took advantage of the victory to charge into the city and burned down three Japanese warehouses. By noon, Japanese reinforcements from the Fankou area were being fiercely attacked by the Chinese troops. (15th dispatch)</p>
<p>Funglok Ho: The war situation in Central Hubei is progressing rapidly. On the 13th, the Chinese troops launched a surprise night attack on the Japanese troops from multiple directions. Unable to withstand the attacks, the Japanese troops retreated southwest in succession at dawn on the 14th. The Chinese troops have now completely occupied the highlands south of Gaopo Shiling Temple and continued to advance into the southeastern region, completely recovering Wangjiatai and Sunjiadian. Another unit has advanced to Zhujiamiao north of Yangzi and the Wuwan area southwest of Gaopo. Currently, most of the remaining Japanese troops are retreating to various strongholds near Yangzi, and the Chinese troops are making efforts to wipe them out. Since the Japanese troops' reinforcement and counterattack, there have been six days and nights of bloody battles, with a total of over 3,000 Japanese soldiers killed. (15th dispatch)</p>

<p>Japanese Troops on All Fronts Repelled</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to news received here today, the Japanese troops' offensives on all fronts last week were repelled by the Chinese troops, and they suffered significant losses. 10,000 Japanese troops on the Jingshan-Zhongxiang highway launched an attack on the Chinese positions last Saturday, covered by airplanes and artillery. After strong resistance from the Chinese troops, the Japanese troops were finally forced to retreat on Sunday afternoon. As of today, the Jing-Zhong highway is still under Chinese control. 2,000 Japanese troops in the northern part of Xiaxian, Jin Southwest, carrying 12 tanks and 10 artillery pieces, attacked the Chinese positions last Saturday. As of Sunday night, the Chinese troops were still strongly resisting the Japanese offensive. It is reported that the number of Japanese soldiers killed has reached 300. In the Yicheng area, 60 kilometers east and west of Xiaxian, Chinese and Japanese troops are still engaged in fierce battles. Furthermore, the Japanese troops who attacked Qinyang, the western end of the Daoqing Line, have been repelled by the Chinese troops, with 220 Japanese corpses left on the battlefield. In South Hubei, the Japanese troops surrounded by strong Chinese forces are currently attempting to break out, but all attempts have failed. In Shandong, the guerrillas are extremely active.

<p>A Company of Chinese Troops Sacrifices Heroically</p>
<p>Xiangyang: After Jiangjiagang, Yujialuzi, Xinzhaizi, and other places near Suixian were recovered by the Chinese, the Japanese repeatedly sent reinforcements for counterattacks, but they were all defeated, and many Japanese corpses were left behind. On the 13th, the Japanese troops increased to over 2,000, with dozens of artillery pieces and many airplanes, and fiercely attacked Jiangjiagang. Kong Fandi, the company commander of the Chinese defending forces, led his officers and soldiers to fight the Japanese troops, killing hundreds of Japanese soldiers. However, due to the disparity in numbers, the entire company made heroic sacrifices. (16th dispatch)</p>

<p>Luoyang: The lower reaches of the Shuangbo River in eastern Henan have been silted up since the breach at Hanbaoying, Fugou County, in the 27th year. Last summer, mountain torrents erupted, and the river breached eastward at Gao Miao Village, Weishi County. The old riverbed dried up, and navigation has long been impossible. More than 400,000 mu of disaster areas in Weishi and Fugou counties were affected, and the victims were exposed to the elements. Since the establishment of the Henan Provincial River Defense Special Works Department, 2,000 yuan has been allocated to rush to close the breach, and river patrol teams from the Yellow River Commission have been transferred to assist. The work has been carried out actively, and the breach at Gao Miao Village was closed ten days ago, the water returned to its old course, and navigation has been restored. As for the specific measures for managing the Shuangbo River, it is estimated that 250,000 yuan is needed for the project, and it has been submitted to the Henan Provincial Government and the Yellow River Commission for approval. It is estimated that it can be completed in about one and a half months after approval. In addition, the Zheng County's entire river channel management project commenced on January 1st and is progressing rapidly. It is expected to be completed within this month. (15th dispatch)</p>

<p>Hong Kong: It is heard that the British government is negotiating with Hong Kong shipyards to build ships. It is believed that at least four freighters will be built. The project will be undertaken by the two major shipyards in Hong Kong, namely Taikoo and Kowloon Shipyards. As for the actual tonnage, it is currently unknown, but it is said to be slightly smaller than the largest 10,000-ton ship built in Hong Kong. Most of the steel needed will come from Australia, and Hong Kong will only provide labor. The chairman of the Kowloon Shipyard said at a banquet that Hong Kong has the convenience of expanding its shipbuilding capacity and can greatly help replenish Britain's war losses. During the last World War, Hong Kong undertook this task and built at least six ships for Britain. (16th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e9">The Forefront of the War of Resistance in Western Sui: Overview of Dalate Banner Leader Kangkang Que Duoerji Arrives in Chongqing to Meet Chiang Kai-shek <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: Kangkang Que Duoerji, the leader of Dalate Banner of the Ik-chao League, arrived in Chongqing on the 12th to report on the banner's affairs to the authorities, ask for instructions on administrative guidelines, and pay respects to the president. He recently made a statement to reporters, briefly stating that Dalate Banner is located south of western Sui, separated from Baotou by only a river, and is the forefront of the War of Resistance. The Dashuwan, which Chinese and Japanese forces have repeatedly fought for, is located within the banner's territory. The banner was once invaded by the Japanese army a year after the War of Resistance but was subsequently driven out by the heroic resistance of our army. The Japanese then stationed heavy troops in Dashuwan as a stronghold for their advance. Due to the important position of the banner, more than 10,000 friendly troops are stationed there. For the past two years of the War of Resistance, the local garrison has spared no effort in providing supplies, such as military rations and leather clothing, which are mostly borne by the local government or taken from the banner government's water and grass taxes. The banner's two regiments, Ma An and Hengdai, are stationed in Cheshe, 90 miles south of Baotou. For the convenience of administration, I also moved the banner government there. Since returning to the banner in April of last year, in response to the needs of the current War of Resistance and for the victory of the military, I have actively rectified my subordinates. In addition to reorganizing the old subordinates of Wuyuan into the Third Regiment, I also established a cadre training team to enhance anti-war skills. The third phase has now begun. In terms of politics, because the original banner government's organization did not meet modern requirements, the banner government was reorganized to enhance administrative efficiency. Propaganda work was carried out against the puppet Mongol regime, extolling the greatness of Chinese nationalism and the position of Mongolia in the Chinese nation, in order to bring them back into the embrace of the motherland. The Baojia system was organized to lay the foundation for resisting and building the nation, and the entire banner was led to take an oath of the National Covenant to strengthen the Mongolian compatriots' belief in the inevitable victory of the War of Resistance. Two elementary schools were established as a preliminary step in promoting education. This is a brief description of my work after returning to the banner. After the banner's affairs were somewhat organized, the Mongolian Political Council held its fourth session. I believe that the slow cultural evolution of Mongolian society is due to poor politics, and the Mongolian political system is the main cause of poor politics. However, during this period of resistance, we should devote all our efforts to the War of Resistance. Therefore, completely abolishing the prince system might cause internal conflicts in Mongolia. Therefore, it is planned to use a progressive approach to establish the foundation of democratic forces. My visit to Chongqing this time is for reporting duties and seeking instructions, and there are no other tasks. (16th dispatch)</p>

<p>Chongqing: President Chiang believes that elementary school teachers across the country are dedicated to education and have contributed to the nation. Since the War of Resistance, local education funding has been tight, and payments have been difficult. Especially in county districts, education funding often cannot be paid on time. At a time when prices are rising and teachers' lives are difficult, it is extremely memorable. In addition to personally instructing the education authorities and various provinces to pay attention and discuss remedies, in order to arouse social respect for elementary school teachers, a telegram was sent to elementary school principals, faculty, and people of society across the country.

<h3 id="e13">Another Place Opened <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao: After the authorities announced on Sunday that another anchorage and two warehouses in Qingdao Port would be opened for use by ships of third countries, another wharf was opened today, totaling four places, in order to facilitate the shipping of third countries. This fourth wharf is only for loading and unloading dangerous goods. People in the shipping industry believe that if these wharves can be used freely, this new concession is a "step forward in the right direction," and pointed out that the two small wharves previously opened were not allowed to be used by foreign ships for several months under the pretext of "military needs." In order to vigorously expel foreign trade in the occupied areas, various forms of discrimination were used against foreigners, especially against British shipping companies. This new concession is still subject to the same restrictions as before, which completely loses the spirit of opening up, and the wording of the previous measures is retained, so it can still be applied in the same form. If this is the case, it is obviously an attempt to show generosity outwardly while not relaxing in reality, in order to influence public opinion in third countries, especially the United States.

<h3 id="e14">China's Foreign Trade Increases Greatly Chinese Goods Exported Through Hong Kong Last Year Valued at HK$274 Million <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: Although Japan has intensified its blockade and war has broken out in Europe, China's exports through Hong Kong have still increased greatly. According to an announcement from the local authorities, the Chinese goods exported through Hong Kong from January to November of last year were valued at HK$274,000,000, including HK$21,000,000 in September, HK$23,250,000 in October, and more than HK$27,000,000 in November. This sharp increase in exports is mostly due to the strong foreign demand for tung oil and tea. However, the export of bristles has been affected by the European war, because Germany previously imported a large number of bristles from China. The authorities also announced that the Ministry of Finance's Trade Rehabilitation Bureau (translated) is working closely with the Foreign Trade Commission and will now focus on the sales and export of tung oil. The Trade Rehabilitation Bureau has a capital of 60 million yuan. The export of bristles is now controlled by the Central Trust Bureau. China exported more than 40,000 tons of tung oil last year, mostly to the United States, to repay US$25 million in credit loans. China's annual tung oil production is about 70,000 tons, and the United States purchased about US$15 million last year. (16th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e16">The Future Direction of the European War <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>The war on the Western Front in Europe is becoming more frozen with the arrival of winter. Will it become vibrant with the arrival of spring and unfold on a large scale? Lord Milner, a member of the British House of Lords, speculated that "within the next three months, Hitler will launch an all-out attack on the Western Front, in order to break through the British and French lines. If necessary, he will even attack neutral countries..." This speculation can only be proven by facts. Currently, the fact is that both sides have not yet engaged in a decisive battle and are still in a stalemate. Originally, spending a large amount of ammunition and manpower to seize one or two strong strongholds is not favored by military strategists in ancient and modern China and abroad. For no reason, Britain and France announced a three-year war plan, deciding to use a long-term blockade to weaken Germany and cause it to collapse economically, achieving the goal of winning without a fight. At the same time, Germany also announced a five-year war plan, using submarine policies to counter Britain and France's naval blockade plan, and attempting to strengthen its domestic economic power and absorb materials from Southeastern European countries with Goering's four-year plan, in order to fight a long-term war with Britain and France. It can be seen that both sides are unwilling to risk huge sacrifices to win a battle, and what they are fighting for is the final victory of the entire war. Reviewing the actual situation of both sides, in terms of economics, Germany is of course not as wealthy as the Allied countries. The naval blockade is a major threat to Germany, which will inevitably affect Germany's resources to a considerable extent. However, because Germany has the support of small countries in Southeastern Europe and the assistance of the Soviet Union, it will be difficult for Britain and France to achieve the expected results in the short term. The so-called Germany "will be unable to save itself if it does not win in three to four months" is either a foolish curse or a fallacious observation. In terms of military strategy, the most likely way for Germany to win on the Western Front is the so-called "Blitzkrieg." Germany's tactics in the Polish War were very effective. Holding the power of thunder and lightning, it acted with lightning speed, (1) preventing Poland from completing its mobilization plan and preventing Polish troops from concentrating in ideal strongholds; (2) Germany had 3,000 airplanes to deal with Poland's 360 airplanes, which was more than enough. Hitler was able to plan to destroy them in one fell swoop. However, Hitler's gains in the Eastern Theater cannot be applied to the Western Theater, because the air forces of Britain and France were at least evenly matched with Germany in the early stages of the war. After some time, Britain and France will be able to replenish and make great progress. Germany's war on the Eastern Front also gave France an opportunity to prepare its military equipment in a relaxed manner. When Germany was elated and triumphant in Poland, French troops had already been deployed in various strategic locations, which Germany could not easily attack. As for the German army's plan to invade neutral countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium in order to directly approach the flanks of the British and French troops and win a decisive victory, this had already been so loudly rumored as early as November of last year, but until now, it is still cloudy and rainy, and has not been launched. Although such a stalemate situation will definitely not remain unchanged for a long time, it is difficult to predict when and how it will change. However, in the short term, Germany will definitely not make a desperate move unless it has some chance of winning. Therefore, in the near future, there will be no major surprises on the Western Front, and some neutral neighboring countries, such as the Netherlands and Belgium, will not be able to maintain their neutrality for the time being.</p>
<p>Recently, at a time of tension in the Netherlands and Belgium, there is another saying that Germany is feigning an attack in the east while attacking in the west. The posture is to attack the Netherlands and Belgium, but the real intention is to descend on Central and Southern Europe in one fell swoop. Originally, the Balkan countries may soon be dragged into the vortex of war. Major powers have already launched political offensives against these countries. The main purpose of Western European democracies is to hope that the Balkan countries will form a Danube River group, maintain neutrality, and prevent those ambitious major powers from interfering in it. However, this plan has largely failed. The Balkan countries each have their own desires and their own affections and grievances. Although it cannot be said that their friendships and enmities have been fully determined so far, nor can it be said that their inclinations are fixed, it is clear that the Balkan countries will not become a strong and complete wall against Germany. It is also clear that there are hidden internal and external crises in the Balkan countries. Because of this crisis, although it cannot be said that Germany is feigning an attack in the east while attacking in the west, and that the action is imminent, it is possible to take advantage of the opportunity at any time and anywhere. Not only that, but the Balkans were originally the powder keg of Europe, with no shortage of fuses. In the past, it was the focus of attention for politicians from all countries, the arena for ambitious people to compete, and the most easily conquered link in the military. Although the Netherlands and Belgium are small countries, compared to the Balkans, the situation in the Netherlands and Belgium is solid, stable, and simple. Comparing the two, it is possible that with the arrival of spring and the development of the war, the first to be dragged into the vortex of war, unable to maintain neutrality, may not be on the Western Front, and may not be the Netherlands and Belgium, which are currently the most tense!</p>

<p>(Question) What is the keynote of the political program and policies?</p>
<p>(Answer) As already announced, handling the current incident will be the top priority. We intend to follow the policies of the previous cabinet. Specific issues will be studied in the future.</p>
<p>(Question) Regarding the future stages of handling the incident, what attitude do you intend to adopt?</p>
<p>(Answer) The fundamental attitude is to follow the policies of the previous cabinet. As for future stages, we will conduct thorough research and implement them accordingly.</p>
<p>(Question) What are your views on the "new regime"?</p>
<p>(Answer) I am confident that a new regime can be established. As for the timing of its establishment, I hope it can be realized as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the basic principles for adjusting diplomacy?</p>
<p>(Answer) The diplomatic keynote is to adhere to an independent stance. As for specific details, I and the Foreign Minister will explain various policies in detail in the Diet.</p>
<p>(Question) What does "independent" mean?</p>
<p>(Answer) "Independent" means being self-reliant and acting independently.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the policy for adjusting relations with Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union?</p>
<p>(Answer) There will be no significant changes from the policies of the previous cabinet. We will adhere to an independent stance as the basis for seeking adjustments in diplomatic relations.</p>
<p>(Question) What about relations with the Soviet Union in particular?</p>
<p>(Answer) The measures of the previous cabinet were very appropriate. It would be best to gradually eliminate the root causes of conflict between the two sides.</p>
<p>(Question) There are many pending issues between Japan and the Soviet Union. Where will you start?</p>
<p>(Answer) We intend to first seek a resolution to the border issue.</p>
<p>(Question) What about other third countries?</p>
<p>(Answer) We will use an independent stance as the basis. This is the same for both Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>(Question) Among domestic issues, the most important is the operation of controlled economy. What policies will you use to handle this?</p>
<p>(Answer) Regarding the controlled economy, the method of using the term "controlled economy" is not yet clear. The issue of control must be implemented, but we must be cautious about its adverse effects.</p>
<p>(Question) Have you considered strengthening the invocation of the National Mobilization Law?</p>
<p>(Answer) This point has been deeply studied.</p>
<p>(Question) How will you handle the issue of the Ministry of Trade, which was handed over from the previous cabinet?</p>
<p>(Answer) Regarding the matters that the previous cabinet left unresolved, we have not been able to study this, so no decision has been made.</p>
<p>(Question) The Abe cabinet adopted a system of a small number of cabinet ministers at the beginning of its formation. The Konoe and Hiranuma cabinets also convened Five Ministers’ Conferences. What kind of consideration will the new cabinet give to the operation of the system?</p>
<p>(Answer) The operation of the cabinet system, it is already clear that I intend to fully staff all cabinet positions in this cabinet formation. If there are problems, we plan to discuss them with particularly relevant cabinet members. Perhaps there will be some, but I do not want to hold any specific meetings of any kind.</p>
<p>(Question) How will the system of councilors be handled?</p>
<p>(Answer) The appointment of councilors is planned. After the councilors are decided, we will respect and adopt their opinions on matters related to handling the current incident, especially regarding internal affairs issues.</p>
<p>(Question) What are your thoughts on parliamentary politics?</p>
<p>(Answer) I respect parliamentary politics.</p>
<p>(Question) What are your considerations regarding political parties at present?</p>
<p>(Answer) Political parties are like the elements of humanity. Political parties at present have no shortcomings. Therefore, this cabinet has increased the number of cabinet members from political parties to four. However, political parties are formed by a collection of many people, so it is possible that there may be some bad elements among them. This is true for any organization. However, it would be best if we could gradually correct the shortcomings.</p>
<p>(Question) Will the budget be inherited from the previous cabinet, or will a new one be prepared?</p>
<p>(Answer) We have not yet considered the budget. However, we will generally inherit the budget decided by the previous cabinet.</p>
<p>(Question) Will the laws be submitted to the Diet as before, or will they be submitted specifically to the current cabinet? If submitting specially to the current cabinet, are there any important bills?</p>
<p>(Answer) We have not yet fully seen the laws, but we intend to study them carefully. Regarding important bills to be submitted specifically to the current cabinet, if necessary, we will consider them separately. However, there are no such decisions at present.

The Foreign Minister stated that the new cabinet's diplomatic policy, as declared by Prime Minister Yonei, is primarily aimed at resolving the China Incident. At the same time, it will adjust relations with third countries from an independent standpoint. Japan resolutely stands on an independent stance and will never maintain friendly relations with one side of a third country while developing hostile relations with the other. Instead, it will maintain friendly relations with all countries according to their respective positions and needs. This kind of adjustment of diplomatic relations is truly in line with the essence of diplomacy.</p>
<p>On Relations with the United States</p>
<p>Regarding Japan's relations with the United States, as I am not yet familiar with the recent situation, I am not in a position to elaborate. However, the fundamental policy towards the United States will naturally inherit the policies of the previous cabinet. That is, in order to rebuild the traditional friendly relations between Japan and the United States, we must first normalize the relations between the two countries. The follow-up measures to the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation are a prerequisite for this work. The opening of the Yangtze River is entirely implemented by Japan from an independent standpoint. Preparations are currently underway to realize the opening. If people recall that the Hiranuma Cabinet had already decided on the fundamental policy of opening the Yangtze River at that time, they will surely understand Japan's independent stance. Furthermore, the various pending issues concerning Japan-U.S. relations in China that need to be resolved must be resolved gradually. I firmly believe that if the United States observes Japan's fair attitude with a proper perspective, it will cooperate with Japan in a constructive spirit to adjust the relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>On Relations with the Soviet Union</p>
<p>When Japan concluded the Anti-Comintern Pact, I was the person in charge. Therefore, some people may have concerns about diplomacy towards the Soviet Union. However, the policy of the Japanese government is to treat the Anti-Comintern Pact and friendly relations between Japan and the Soviet Union as separate issues. Considering that the two governments of Japan and the Soviet Union, after the establishment of the Anti-Comintern Pact under the Hirota Cabinet, made every effort to negotiate the demarcation of the national border and the handling of disputes, one can understand Japan's attitude. Unfortunately, the relations between the two countries temporarily deteriorated thereafter. However, recently, the causes of this misfortune have been eliminated, and I am extremely pleased to see the restoration of the spirit of friendship. In the future, we also intend to continue to strive to resolve various pending issues with the goal of normalizing relations between the two countries. Demarcating the national border is indeed an extremely difficult problem. However, if Japan and the Soviet Union use this issue to promote the spirit of friendship, it will be several times more effective than a non-aggression treaty.</p>
<p>On Relations with Britain</p>
<p>I was involved in negotiations with Britain during the Hiranuma Cabinet, so I firmly believe that the time is not far off when Britain will awaken and improve Anglo-Japanese relations.</p>
<p>On Relations with Germany and Italy</p>
<p>The Japan-Germany-Italy Anti-Comintern Pact still exists. Japan's friendly relations with Germany and Italy have not changed in the slightest. I intend to further strengthen relations with Germany and Italy in the future. If someone believes that Japan's rapprochement with the Soviet Union will hinder its friendly relations with Germany and Italy, that person is an outsider to Japan's independent diplomacy.

<p>Chongqing – The Xinhua Daily News editorial today stated that the policies of the Yonei cabinet will be largely determined by Japan's small clique of zaibatsu and industrial giants. Therefore, it is expected that the new Japanese cabinet will first adopt a policy of compromise with Britain and the United States, and then attempt to fundamentally resolve the so-called "China Incident." The newspaper concluded by warning the Chinese people to be wary of the Japanese cabinet's impending "political offensive" in China in an attempt to destroy China's unity and resistance.

<h3 id="e21">Yonei Cabinet Shows Signs of Soundness; First-Rate Figures Refuse to Take Office <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo – Generally, newspapers here believe that the Yonei cabinet lacks sound new elements to implement radical policies to cope with the urgent financial and economic situation and eliminate subsequent anxieties. It is concerning that the appointment of some important positions in the new cabinet was under pressure from the political crisis and not based on appropriate candidates. The newspapers expressed regret that some first-rate politicians and leaders in the financial world refused to take office. According to the Asahi Shimbun, the appointment of Sakurauchi as Minister of Finance was quite unexpected, and it is predicted that the policies he will implement will not be much different from those of the previous Japanese Minister of Finance after the start of the Sino-Japanese War. As for the domestic problems that the new cabinet must deal with, they include: (1) The thorny issue of rigorously revising the 10 billion yen budget, as this is necessary to prevent the continued increase in the issuance of banknotes, otherwise there is a risk of causing uncontrollable inflation; (2) Stabilizing the supply of food and other daily necessities. In addition, there are various major events that must have planned and perfect policies that can be quickly implemented to fundamentally solve them. Japan's foreign policy is unlikely to undergo changes. The newspaper predicts that Foreign Minister Arita will continue to promote the policy of recognizing and not interfering with the interests of all countries in China in establishing a "New Order in East Asia." The resolution of the Tianjin Incident will depend on the future actions of Britain. Japanese observers believe that Japan-U.S. talks cannot continue at this time because the opening of the Yangtze River cannot be quickly realized due to local conditions. In short, Foreign Minister Arita will not rush for the moment and will try to use appropriate means to resolve it. (16th, Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Tokyo – The political and civil parties, each in the capacity of party representatives, guaranteed the cabinet members of the new Yonei cabinet, showing a positive attitude of cooperation and resolving the confrontational situation between the government and political parties during the Abe cabinet. Therefore, when the Diet reconvenes, the two parties will be more coordinated with the government. In addition, the two parties also held general affairs meetings and executive committee meetings separately on the 16th to discuss countermeasures to deal with the Diet and future policies, and plan to clarify the policy of supporting the new cabinet before the Diet convenes.

<h3 id="e23">Financial Straits Reach Extreme; Let's See How the New Finance Minister Handles It <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo – The financial means of the new Minister of Finance, Yukio Sakurauchi, are still unknown, but he has experience as Minister of Commerce and Industry and Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, and with the cooperation of Chief Secretary Ishiwata and Masanori Katsu, who is proficient in finance, he will definitely be able to implement financial and economic policies. The financial problems that need to be solved by the new Minister of Finance are as follows: (1) The issue of implementing the 10 billion yen budget. The Abe cabinet compiled the Showa 15 budget centered on handling the incident and national defense plans. The new cabinet must also submit this budget to the Diet for approval, but the amount reaches 10 billion yen, so when it is implemented, it is necessary to consider issues such as digesting public bonds and stabilizing the lives of the people. (2) Smoothing out economic control. Economic control needs to be strengthened, but the past control has exposed its shortcomings in terms of bureaucracy. It is unknown what new control methods the new Minister of Finance will implement. (3) Fundamental reform of finance. Reorganizing central and local finances seems to continue the policies of the Abe cabinet, but it remains to be seen whether the new Minister of Finance can make it pass the Diet and be implemented quickly. The Trade Promotion Planning Board is reviewing the resource mobilization plan, and the Ministry of Finance is also echoing this, and must devote all its efforts to promoting trade, expanding productivity, and obtaining foreign exchange. In the past, the government was merely obsessed with trivial issues such as the Ministry of Trade. It is unknown what the new cabinet's ★foreign trade policy will be. (16th, Domei dispatch)</p>

In order to implement it, it is necessary to have thorough preparation and unwavering determination. He also said that the officers and soldiers on the front line should demonstrate the power of the "Imperial Army" with an iron unity that is not disturbed by a single thread, and show it to both China and foreign countries.

<p>Washington - Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark recently submitted a report to the House Naval Affairs Committee, arguing that the United States Navy should maintain a five-to-three ratio with Japan. He said that the United States naval expansion plan has been released by the Navy Department, and its goal is to enhance the United States naval strength, so as to be able to exceed the combined power of the navies of "countries opposed to peace." Some people advocate that the United States Navy should set up two fleets, the Atlantic and the Pacific. I believe this is impossible. I still agree with the current organization, that is, only setting up one fleet that can be quickly mobilized between the Atlantic and Pacific. (15th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington - Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark told the House Naval Affairs Committee yesterday that the US Navy needs to have larger submarines than any other country, as there may be a need for submarine warfare in the South Atlantic. Germany and the Soviet Union have built many small submarines to attack nearby enemies, but the United States is building submarines to resist enemy aggression farther from our shores. Japan has consistently built a large number of submarines that can operate in the described areas. Some speakers pointed out that the US$1.3 billion naval expansion focused on destroyers, and the balance between light and heavy was lost. Stark replied that Britain has a total of 359 destroyers, in addition to specially built auxiliary ships. (16th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Pay Attention to Far East Defense Set Up a Governor of Guam</p>
<p>Washington - The US Naval Command announced yesterday that Captain Macmillan, captain of the repair ship "Medusa", will take office as Governor of Guam and Commander of the Guam Naval Station around January 17. The term of office of the new commander is often after the expiration of the 1911 Japan-U.S. Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, which the United States announced would be abolished (January 26). According to Guam, it is 1,300 miles south of Yokohama. (16th, United Press dispatch)</p>

<p>Japan Establishes Defenses in Saipan Facing Guam Across the Water</p>
<p>Washington - US Naval Authorities in Guam wired the Naval Department last night, saying that the US Minesweeper "Penguin" recently rescued 24 crew members of a Japanese fishing boat in distress off the southeast coast of Guam. The Guam Naval Authorities contacted the Governor of Saipan, Japan, and the US Navy sent a ship to send the Japanese fishermen to the island. It is found that Saipan is a heavily guarded Japanese island, only a few miles away from Guam, where the United States intends to establish defenses, and is the Japanese naval base closest to Guam. US military authorities have always paid close attention to the island. Observers here are now closely watching how the Japanese Governor of Saipan responds to the Guam Naval Authorities. If the Japanese Governor refuses to allow the US warship to escort the victims to Saipan, some observers believe that the United States Council may determine that the island has been fortified, and pass the Naval Authorities' Guam defense plan.

<h3 id="e28">Japan Eager to Renew Temporary Commercial Treaty with the United States No New Developments in Tokyo Negotiations <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Washington - Secretary of State Hull stated at a reception for reporters yesterday that the imminent abolition of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty is only one of the issues that urgently need to be resolved between the United States and Japan. Although Hull did not explicitly mention other issues, it is believed that he was referring to the U.S. government's protests against Japan's destruction of the lives and property of American overseas Chinese in China. Hull remained silent on reports from Tokyo that a "draft of a transitional agreement" had been submitted to the U.S. government, saying only that there had been no new developments regarding the renewal of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty. The State Department also remained silent on the change of the Japanese cabinet. (16th, United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington - Diplomatic circles here believe that the Japanese are trying to reach an understanding with the United States on the Far East before the expiration of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty on January 26. The Yonei cabinet has adopted a more friendly attitude towards Western powers than the Abe cabinet. The news that the Japanese side has proposed a transitional agreement is related to the Yonei cabinet, and it may be possible to obtain satisfactory results. Japanese people here generally believe that the Yonei cabinet is extremely strong and can independently solve Japan's current difficult problems. According to well-informed sources, they believe that the military men of the Japanese navy are now in power, and their policies must adopt a friendly attitude towards Britain, because the Japanese naval community has a good impression of Britain. Some people even said that it is possible to repeat the friendly relations between Britain and Japan in 1920. As for Japan's policy towards China, there will be no drastic changes, but the attitude towards third countries in China may change. (16th, United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington - After Japanese Navy Admiral Yonei organized a new cabinet, the Republican Party's "Star Evening News" commented, "The army and navy are the main driving forces in Japan." If the army and navy cannot relax their attitude towards China and the so-called "New Order in Asia," then even if General Yonei sympathizes with the United States and makes it his duty to improve U.S.-Japan relations, it may not be successful. Now, Japanese intellectuals and business circles are extremely dissatisfied with the various burdens caused by the Sino-Japanese War, but the army and navy have failed to express their will and cancel the goals they have set, so that General Yonei or any other politician can establish an understanding with the United States. To be the place. In short, the principle issue of Japan is a human issue. Wanting to cover up the importance of the principle by changing personnel is a mistake. The U.S. government has a very clear understanding of the principle issue, and even if the leader of the Japanese government is a friend of the United States, there is a reason to ignore it. (16th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington - As the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty is about to expire on the 26th of this month, responsible people here recently stated that if the Japanese government wants to establish a temporary measure to replace the commercial treaty with the United States, it must provide concrete guarantees to respect U.S. interests in China. It is heard that the Japanese side has indeed proposed that the two sides negotiate a temporary agreement to ensure that the most-favored-nation clause can be maintained for at least some time, and hopes that the difficulties caused by certain members of the Japanese military repeatedly hindering U.S. interests in China will also be satisfactorily resolved. However, American people generally say that Japan's provision of concrete guarantees is a prerequisite for all negotiations. Otherwise, the commercial relations between the two countries will form a "no treaty state" from the 26th of this month. However, this does not mean that the United States should discriminate against Japan in commerce. However, the position of the United States thereafter is that it can take various discriminatory measures against Japan at any time. In fact, once the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty expires, the only consequence is that the import tax rate levied by the United States on Japanese goods will automatically increase. As for the current treatment of Japanese expatriates in the United States and American expatriates in Japan, there will be no changes. However, the U.S. Congress is no longer bound by any treaty and can pass bills at any time to take retaliatory measures against Japanese goods in terms of tariffs, or even prohibit the shipment of certain goods to Japan. Recently, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman expressed his readiness to request Congress to pass a bill prohibiting the shipment of various raw materials to Japan after the expiration of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty. In addition, the "Smyth-Hawley Act" stipulates that the U.S. government may also prohibit the import of goods from countries that discriminate against U.S. commerce. Therefore, if necessary, President Roosevelt can also invoke this law to deal with Japan. (15th, Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>According to Howard newspapers in New York, the appointment of Yonei as Prime Minister has not improved U.S.-Japan relations. In the past few months, although Tokyo has hoped to resolve the disputes between the United States and Japan, the result has been empty promises and gestures. Now, Yonei's appointment as Prime Minister is due to this hope, but whether the dispute between Japan and the United States can be resolved peacefully depends on whether the Japanese warlords can respect treaty obligations. The United States will never relax its insistence on observing treaties. Moreover, the majority of Americans believe that the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty should not be renewed after it expires, and advocate for the prohibition of arms materials and supplies that can promote Japan's aggression against China. In short, what the United States hopes for is not only empty promises and gestures from the Japanese side, but also that the forces that now rule Japan can abandon their policy of force and return to the path of peace and mutual concession.

<h3 id="e34">British Observation: Situation in Belgium and Holland; Germany to Attack Within a Month <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>London: Diplomatic circles are currently commenting on the situation in Belgium and Holland, generally stating that according to news received in London, Germany plans to launch an attack on the 25th of this month. It is difficult to determine whether this news is accurate or a scare tactic by Germany. In any case, whenever Germany initiates its aggressive actions, Belgium and Holland are certainly feeling threatened and should take all possible precautions. In November of last year, Germany originally planned to invade Holland. Belgium immediately expressed solidarity with Holland. The German General Staff, considering that Belgium's strength was no longer comparable to 1914, and that Britain and France might intervene immediately without waiting for Germany to defeat Belgium and Holland, hesitated and postponed the plan. The situation remains unchanged to this day. The question is, if Germany disregards Belgium's support of Holland and the intervention of British and French forces, and invades recklessly, what will their plan be? According to absolutely reliable sources received here, Germany has indeed concentrated a large number of troops on the borders of Luxembourg, Holland, Belgium, and northeastern France. British military circles observe that if Germany attacks, it will definitely launch a strong offensive on the French front to restrain the British and French Allied forces, preventing them from being transferred to the Belgian border. At the same time, it will launch a large-scale offensive against Belgium, heading straight for the port of Ostend. If successful, the British and French Allied forces and the Belgian army will be restrained, and German forces can invade Holland to achieve a swift victory. The main goal of this plan is to seize submarine and air force bases on the Dutch coast in order to launch a large-scale attack on Britain and, if the situation permits, to strike France with fierce force. However, this hope is relatively slim. Opinions differ as to whether Germany will implement the above plan. Some believe that if Germany intends to attack, why would it repeatedly issue warnings, allowing Belgium and Holland to prepare calmly? However, according to general opinion, Germany definitely intends to do so, and it is only a matter of time. Currently, it is deliberately creating confusion in order to allow the state of alert to pass. Once the tense period is over, Belgium and Holland may relax their vigilance and partially demobilize their armies, and then launch a surprise attack with lightning speed. Therefore, Belgium and Holland must take adequate precautions without any negligence, and Britain and France must also closely monitor the situation. From the military preparedness of Belgium and Holland, and the cancellation of all leave by the British and French Allied forces, one can see the attitude of these countries.

<p>Brussels: King Leopold III of Belgium met with Prime Minister Pierlot, Foreign Minister Spaak, and Defense Minister Denis yesterday to discuss general mobilization measures and various important national defense issues. Furthermore, at a cabinet meeting last night, chaired by Prime Minister Pierlot, several administrative measures were decided, including the banning of communist newspapers and the establishment of concentration camps for foreigners. It is pointed out here that the royal decree of 1916, which regulates news control, is still in effect. The location for the construction of the concentration camp has been decided between Brussels and Houthulst, with a capacity of approximately 6,000 people. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Brussels: Although the situation is still relaxed tonight, Belgium's attitude towards reports of the concentration of German troops on the Dutch border remains tense, but calmly so. Political figures say that the fourth stage of supplementing the army in the mobilization order is now in effect. Unless there is a major change in the international situation, the fourth stage will not be canceled and returned to the third stage. It is reported that Belgium's decision to implement the fourth stage of the mobilization order was not due to the discovery of a certain plan in a German aircraft forced to land in Belgium, but due to political and military intelligence received in Brussels. The Belgian mobilization order is divided into five stages, with the fifth stage being general mobilization. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Brussels: The atmosphere of panic in Belgium has gradually eased. Residents evacuated from the border area of Aubange-Meix-devant-Virton have now arrived in Nieuwpoort and are being welcomed by the local residents. Public buildings throughout Belgium are still guarded by the military, and special air raid precautions are still being taken everywhere. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>

It is said that the government's decision on this measure is to enhance air defense effectiveness. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam: The atmosphere in Holland eased slightly yesterday, and the newspapers here also expressed a sense of stability. Regarding the denial by German officials of discussions about military affairs between Belgium and Holland, the newspapers here are satisfied. Diplomatic figures in The Hague stated that Belgium's panic is greater than Holland's. It is now known that Belgium is still maintaining close contact with the French government. The Belgian ambassador to France has again visited French Prime Minister Daladier. Diplomatic figures believe that Holland's military measures are aimed at maintaining close contact with its southern neighbor and expressing its determination to strictly adhere to neutrality. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>The Hague: After Belgium and Holland took various military precautions, the German semi-official agency Deutsche Nachrichtenagentur indicated it was at the instigation of the British and French governments.

<p>Amsterdam: Dutch military authorities continued to inspect national defense preparations today, but no new measures were announced. According to responsible sources in The Hague, Holland has prepared everything, but one must not think that there is any danger at present. The Hague has denied the talk of a Belgian-Dutch military alliance and pointed out that the positions of the two countries are completely different. If Holland is invaded, Belgium's participation in the war will be extremely important, but if Belgium is invaded, Holland's maintaining neutrality may be more beneficial to Belgium. At the same time, the Belgian and Dutch governments are continuing to contact each other. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Paris: The French Foreign Ministry issued a warning today, stating that France will provide full assistance to any neutral country attacked by Germany.

<h3 id="e43">Soviet Air Force Employs Pincer Movement Against Finland; Bombing Everywhere, Over a Thousand Bombs Dropped; Finland Appeals to All Countries for Assistance in Resisting Soviet Aircraft <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>London: A spokesman for the Finnish Embassy in London stated that Finland cannot resist the Soviet air force's superiority without greater assistance from the world. In the past three days, the weather has been slightly clearer, allowing Soviet bombers to fly closer to their targets and bomb 27 places, with as many as 400 Soviet aircraft participating in the bombing, dropping over a thousand bombs. The Soviet air force is now employing a pincer movement, using its new bases in Estonia to attack the west coast, and using air force bases on the east border to harass other parts of Finland. Finland cannot control this advantage because its air force bases are located on the south coast behind the Karelian Isthmus. However, the Finns' determined fighting spirit is not shaken by the constant harassment from the sky. If the world thinks that Finland's temporary victories on land mean that Finland is gradually gaining final victory, it will create a tragedy. The Finns know that the victories at Suomussalmi are only victories in one corner. The Soviet army is still gathering, and the Soviet Union relies on its bombers to occupy a superior position in the sky, so Finland must get more fighter planes. Finland's fate depends on whether it can get more assistance in the sky. Finland appeals to all countries in the world to assist it in resisting Soviet power. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>

<h3 id="e47">Japanese Troops Are Unable to Defend Both Ends, Suffering Heavy Casualties in a Few Days <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Guanshao: The Japanese troops invading Guangdong Province this time dispatched three divisions and one mixed brigade, plus more than 10,000 naval landing forces. At the end of last month, they launched a fierce northward offensive from Zengcheng, Conghua, and Huaxian counties. The Chinese army, according to the planned strategy, lured them deep into Wengyuan and Yingde, launching a full-scale counter-offensive on New Year's Day, cutting them into several sections and annihilating them one by one. The Japanese troops were unable to defend both ends, suffering more than 10,000 casualties in a few days, and completely collapsed across the board on the second day. The arduous struggle of the Chinese army for the past ten days has resulted in a victory in northern Guangdong comparable to the great victory in northern Hunan. Subsequently, they bravely pursued the enemy and have now advanced into Qingyuan County. The following is a record of the battle:</p>
<h3 id="e48">A Large-Scale Counter-Offensive Launched on the Morning of the Second Day <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Tracing back to the Japanese troops who invaded Shaoguan, after they sneaked into Wengyuan and crossed the county seat, they were intercepted by the Chinese army at Xinjiang. At the same time, the Chinese army in Qujiang and Shixing also launched a large-scale southward advance. From the morning of the second day, a large-scale counter-offensive was launched, with fierce battles taking place all day in Xinjiang and the surrounding areas of the county seat. That evening, the Chinese army had crossed Xinjiang and recovered Wengyuan city. At the same time, the Japanese positions in Guantou were also recaptured one after another. By this point, the Japanese troops had suffered thousands of casualties and fled south in a state of panic, mostly retreating to the Qingtang area under Yingde's jurisdiction. Before retreating, they burned civilian houses and killed many civilians along the way, resulting in extremely tragic scenes. In order to take advantage of the victory and pursue the enemy to achieve greater results with less effort, the Chinese army detoured from Guantou to Qingtang. At noon on the second day, they stormed into northeastern Qingtang. The Chinese and Japanese armies engaged in fierce battles again in the area north of Qingtang. In order to cover the retreat of their defeated troops, the Japanese side dispatched aircraft all day to soar over Wengyuan, Xinfeng, and Yingde, providing cover for the rear withdrawal. On the evening of the third day, a certain elite unit of the Chinese army divided into two routes to encircle and attack the Japanese positions in Shangleidong, Xinfeng. The Japanese troops stationed there also showed signs of shifting backward. As a result, bloody battles unfolded in Shangleidong and the Qingtang area. Both sides bombarded each other with intense artillery fire. By 3:00 AM on the fourth day, the Chinese army's offensive became even fiercer, and the Japanese troops could no longer hold their ground, so they withdrew from Qingtang and fled in a panic towards Shidaokeng. At the time, the Japanese positions in Shangleidong, affected by the retreat from Qingtang, had been attacked by the Chinese army on three sides. Because they were attacked from both the front and rear, they immediately fled backward.</p>

<p>After the Chinese army successively recovered Shangleidong and Qingtang, the main force continued to attack south. Most of the remaining Japanese troops fled to Zhaogang between Xinfeng and Longmen, which was the main force of the remaining Japanese troops. In the area south of Xinfeng, there were still remnants of Japanese and puppet troops wandering around. The Chinese army launched a tight counter-offensive, and the heavy artillery unit also frequently displayed its power, fiercely bombarding the main location of the Japanese troops and their artillery positions. On the morning of the fourth day, they had launched a sweep of the Japanese troops in Zhaogang between Xinfeng and Longmen and west of Changning. At the same time, they concentrated artillery fire to bomb Shenkeng. Because the Japanese artillery unit had fled to Shenkeng, the Chinese army refused to relax even slightly. Until nightfall, the Chinese army's heavy artillery bombarded fiercely, and more than half of the Japanese artillery positions were destroyed. In addition, after the Chinese army cleared out the remaining Japanese troops south of Wengyuan, the troops on the frontal counter-offensive, in order to cooperate with the side-road assault, also went straight down to Lianjiangkou from Yingde along the Yuehan Railway. At the same time, the plainclothes team was active in various places behind the Japanese army, attacking Hengshi and Lidong separately. On the night of the fourth day, the two armies were already engaged in mixed battles along the way, with more than a thousand Japanese casualties. The Chinese army was also approaching Qingyuan. The frontal counter-offensive troops made even more active progress.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Chinese Aircraft Bombard Juntian <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>After the Japanese troops were severely attacked along the railway line, the Japanese troops south of Qingyuan were extremely panicked. More than 10,000 remnants gathered between Qingyuan and Huaxian, mostly fleeing to Juntian, Xinjie, and the south of Yinzhan and other places. In order to wipe out the remaining Japanese forces, the Chinese side dispatched eighteen aircraft at 6:00 AM on the morning of the fourth day, suddenly flying over Juntian and the southwest of Yinzhan, fiercely bombing the Japanese positions. They dropped sixty or seventy bombs one after another, destroying many Japanese camps, killing or wounding four or five hundred Japanese and puppet troops, and destroying many of their fortifications.</p>

<p>The headquarters of the Fourth War Zone and the headquarters of the Second and Twelfth Army Groups sent news of victory from the front lines. After the Chinese army successively recovered Wengyuan and Yingde and annihilated more than 10,000 Japanese troops, the Shaoguan Garrison Command, the Police Bureau, and the Provincial Party Department and other agencies posted the good news in public places on various main roads, "Our army on the front line has won a great victory, capturing Wengyuan and Yingde on the second day, annihilating more than 10,000 Japanese troops, and the entire line has collapsed." They also toured the city by car to distribute leaflets. When this news spread, the people were overjoyed and rushed to tell each other, jumping for joy and setting off firecrackers to celebrate. This kind of enthusiastic scene had not been seen since the Japanese troops invaded the south. When the Japanese troops invaded the north at the end of the lunar year, the Chinese military and political authorities, in order to express their determination to resist Japan, implemented the evacuation of people and materials and strengthened the defenses. At that time, the situation was quite serious, and the retreat from Wengyuan moved Qujiang even more. However, since the news of victory came, the people's hearts were greatly encouraged, and the people who had retreated from nearby villages have returned one after another. Shops in the city have resumed business one after another, with more than half reopening in one day. The authorities also encouraged the people to form military-civilian cooperation stations to supply various foods for the army to purchase. Therefore, all the highways, railways, towns, and villages within dozens of miles of Shaoguan were bustling with activity, with soldiers and civilians coming and going day and night. The overall situation has been stabilized, and the commercial district of Shaoguan is expected to return to its former appearance within a few days. In view of the situation, the authorities have also ordered the cessation of damage to highways to facilitate transportation.</p>
<h3 id="e52">The Railway Tracks on the Sujia, Huhang Routes Are Repeatedly Destroyed <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Jiaxing: The railway tracks nine li west of the Qixingqiao Station in the east and Jiashan Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway were destroyed by the Chinese army on the morning of the 13th. When a Japanese cargo train from Shanghai to Hangzhou passed through the area, the train head derailed. After the Japanese troops lifted it with a crane and made some repairs, it reopened to Hangzhou. Near Shengze on the Sujia Road, the road surface was dug into a large hole by the Chinese army late at night on the 12th, causing a Japanese military vehicle rushing from Suzhou to overturn here on the morning of the 13th, resulting in heavy losses. It is reported that after the incidents occurred at these two locations, the nearby Japanese troops searched civilian homes as usual, massacring many innocent people.</p>
<p>The base area of the Chinese army in this area was invaded by Japanese and puppet troops the day before yesterday. The Chinese army had prior knowledge of the matter and ambushed in the middle. When the Japanese troops advanced deep into the area, they were given a fierce blow in the waist. After a day and night of fierce fighting between the two sides, about one or two hundred Japanese officers and soldiers were killed or wounded. It is also reported that more than a hundred Japanese troops invaded Hantang Town yesterday morning and were defeated by the guerrillas stationed there.</p>
<p>Agricultural products from the six counties formerly under the jurisdiction of Jiaxing are now being extensively purchased by Japanese collaborators and unscrupulous merchants, causing increasing panic over food supplies in the six counties. As a result, market prices are rising day by day. It is reported that yesterday, the price of rice in Hedi was at least twenty-six or twenty-seven yuan, while the lowest price for other white rice varieties was more than thirty yuan. Therefore, the Chinese military authorities have repeatedly ordered their subordinates to strictly prohibit farmers from transporting rice for sale to the occupied areas, in order to reduce Japanese purchases.</p>

<h3 id="e53">A Review of Chinese Education in 1939 (I) <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Lijiang</p>
<p>(Chongqing Hangxun) Chen Lijiang, Director of the Department of Social Education of the Ministry of Education, recently wrote an article entitled "A Review of Chinese Education in 1939," which describes in detail the Ministry of Education's facilities for higher education, general education, social education, and other education-related endeavors within the year of 1939. The following is an excerpt of the main points.</p>
<p>(I) General Overview</p>
<p>Our country's educational policies were already decided in advance. This year, we continue to inherit the predetermined educational policies of the past, conduct them consistently, and further develop and enrich them. The previously established educational instructions remain the objective of today's education unchanged. The educational policy announced by the Minister of Education after the War of Resistance, emphasizing the parallel development of three educations (intellectual, moral, and physical), the integration of literary and military arts, and the equal emphasis on agriculture and industry, also remains an unchanging principle of today's education. The provisions of Articles 19 to 42 of the Outline for Resistance and National Reconstruction are always regarded as the most important guidelines for today's educational facilities. In addition to these predetermined policies, within this year, we have obtained many more educational guidelines from the President in various aspects of content, making the theory more definite and enriched, and providing higher guidance for implementation. The following are the most important points: (1) We must establish a definite goal for education, and take the Three Principles of the People for national salvation as the highest standard of our country's education, implement the Outline for Resistance and National Reconstruction, and create a new life for the modern nation. (2) We must take the development of the economy and the enhancement of military strength as the guiding principles of our education, develop the economy to enrich the national strength during wartime and lay the foundation for national reconstruction after the war, and enhance military strength in order to defeat the enemy and build the nation and the people. (3) We should use methods suitable for extraordinary times to achieve the original goals of education, use an extraordinary spirit to expand the effectiveness of education, and pay particular attention to strengthening the national will to resist Japan, establishing a positive spirit of national reconstruction, and enhancing the inherent national morality to overcome material difficulties with spirit. (4) Education should be integrated with military affairs, politics, society, economy, and all other undertakings. (5) Education should emphasize the transformation of life, pay attention to life guidance, and teach the people to practice a new life to achieve industrialization, militarization, and rationalization. (6) Education should take the cultivation of national personality as the basic task. To achieve this goal, the education sector should be strict with itself, lead by example, establish a consistent trend, and strive to realize the Three Principles of the People. (7) The goals of moral education should be determined in common. The eight virtues of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, harmony, and peace, as well as the party member code of conduct, should be the fundamental creed of education, so that young people will believe and abide by them consistently, and the four virtues of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame should be the common motto of schools at all levels throughout the country. (8) Education should be based on the six arts of ancient times: rites, music, archery, charioteering, writing, and mathematics, and select content suitable for the times to train the people to promote multi-faceted development and make them suitable for military affairs, heading towards military affairs, so that everyone can defend the country and defend themselves. The above points indicated by the President have the effect of adding a bright light to the forward journey of education in our country, making the direction clearer and the route more followed. This is a great gain this year, and the educational facilities and implementations this year are implemented by inheriting predetermined policies, based on actual needs, and in accordance with the President's instructions.</p>
<p>(II) Higher Education</p>
<p>In higher education, the important progress made this year can be divided into the following items: (1) "The Promotion of Vocational Education": In this academic year, the central government has added schools above the vocational level, including the National Central Technical School, the Northwest Technical School, the Xikang Technical School, and the Chongqing Merchant Marine School. In addition, various specialized courses were specially set up to help out-of-school youth. Fifteen national colleges and universities have established a total of twenty specialized courses. (2) "Improvement of School System and Organization": In terms of the system, the training period for vocational schools in the past was only two or three years, and specialized skills were not easy to master. This year, we will first recruit junior high school graduates from the music, art, veterinary medicine, and sericulture departments to try out a five-year training system. Regarding the organization, it is now stipulated that three offices should be set up: academic affairs, training, and general affairs, and twelve key points for supplementing the administrative organization of universities and independent colleges and vocational branches have been issued to make the organization more reasonable. (3) "Improvement of Training": In the past, there was no fixed standard for the qualifications of training personnel. This year, regulations have been added, and a qualification review committee for training personnel in colleges and above has been organized to select talents. The Ministry of Education has also formulated eight training outlines for colleges and above as a guideline for the implementation of training. (4) "Consolidation of University Curriculum and Compilation of Textbooks": Last year, the Ministry of Education had already set the common required subjects for colleges of liberal arts, science, law, agriculture, commerce, and engineering. This year, it has continued to set the required and elective subjects for each department of liberal arts, science, law, agriculture, commerce, engineering, and normal schools. The National Compilation and Translation Bureau has also been responsible for compiling, writing, and evaluating textbooks for various subjects in universities, striving to rectify the level of universities. (5) "Promotion of Academic Research Work": Academic research in various subjects in universities has been expanded to thirty-two departments in seven subjects this year. In terms of private lectures, there is also the new establishment of Fuxing Academy. The Ministry of Education has also specially set up an Academic Review Committee, which is specifically responsible for coordinating the planning and review of academic research matters.</p>
<h3 id="e54">A Letter from a Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Education to Shanghai Educators, with Encouraging Words and a Frank Discussion of the Stakes <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, all public and private schools in this city received a letter from a special commissioner of the Ministry of Education to "Teachers and Students of All Levels of Schools in Shanghai," hoping that teachers would strengthen their faith and strictly adhere to their posts, and encouraging students to distinguish right from wrong, unite and struggle, and jointly maintain the precarious situation and complete the sacred mission. The words were sincere and touching. The letter stated that Shanghai has been occupied for more than two years. Despite the hardships and precariousness, our Shanghai educators have been struggling hard for their sacred cause, maintaining the lifeline of education. Their achievements will surely be recorded in history forever. Our students, in this autumn of the War of Resistance and national crisis, are still able to work hard in their positions, concentrate on their studies, and maintain the sound of music under the leadership of wise teachers. This spirit is also rare. All of these manifestations of unity and hard work on the part of educators and students are not only admired by the four million citizens of the city, but also deeply appreciated and comforted by the central authorities and the people of the whole country. I am ordered by the central government to share the hardships and joys with you. Witnessing the pain you have suffered, I would like to express my highest respect with the most sincere enthusiasm. On the occasion of the change of the semester, I would like to share with you in detail what I have felt. Today, the situation of the War of Resistance has various favorable aspects in the military, political, economic, and diplomatic fields, confirming the great certainty of the final victory, and it is getting closer and closer. You have a firm belief and a clear understanding, so there is no need for further analysis. However, at this moment when the invaders are using puppets to carry out political offensives in an attempt to make a final struggle, their base methods are emerging one after another. Their conspiracies are aimed at confusing people's minds, shaking people's hearts, and dividing organizations and alienating unity. If you cannot stand firm and discern their schemes, you will surely fall into their trap and never be able to escape. This is something you cannot but pay close attention to. If you can strictly adhere to your posts and not be taken advantage of, then the threat is in your grasp. If you cannot resist to the end with the greatest determination, then you will only have to submit. The glorious history of more than two years of hard struggle will be ruined in one day. This is something you must deeply warn yourself against. In short, at this time of fierce offensive by evil forces, to distinguish right from wrong and to guard against traitors is the primary task of the educators and students at present.

<h3 id="e57">Will the Davis Cup Be Held This Year? Australia Hesitates and Asks the International Lawn Tennis Federation for Instructions. The Situation Is Different from the First World War. <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>(London, 15th, Reuters) With the Davis Cup having been won by Australia last year, there is much interest in finding out if it will proceed this year. As Australia is the current holder of the cup, this year's competition should be under its management. The national associations must declare participation before January 31st. The draw is usually held on February 3. The Australian Lawn Tennis Association recently held a meeting to discuss whether or not play should be suspended during the war. The result was a decision to instruct its representative in London to seek instructions from the International Lawn Tennis Federation.</p>
<p>Although the situation of Australia is complicated by the war, there is not much to suggest the Davis Cup should be suspended this year. Out of the 27 nations that entered last year, 18 are not involved in the conflict. Also, the United States is not yet at war. The situation is totally different from 1914 when all apart from the United States were involved in the war. The question for Australia is whether or not the competition will proceed this year, or to relinquish the trophy. In any case, Australia will face immense difficulties. The two leading players that defeated the United States last year, Bromwich and Quist, are about to enter training for war. The manager, Hopman, will also be joining up for training before long. However, if Australia just enters the competition, perhaps they can find some way of putting a team on the court.</p>

<p>Shanghai is located in the southeast of Jiangsu Province, on the west bank of the Huangpu River, where it converges with the Wusong River. Situated at the mouth of the Yangtze River, it is a crucial hub for traffic between the northern and southern oceans, as well as Europe and America. Due to its advantageous location, it has become the center of national trade, the economic hub, and the only major port in the Far East. The total value of import and export trade has increased from 30 million yuan to over 100 million yuan, accounting for more than 40% of the total national trade volume. In the past, it was a major import surplus port in the country, and the outflow of domestic cash was also the highest in Shanghai. Therefore, the increase or decrease in its import surplus often influenced the size of the national import surplus. The Chinese government, considering that to save the national import surplus, it must first start by eliminating the import surplus in Shanghai. By September of last year, Shanghai's trade turned into an export surplus. The full-year trade for last year is recorded as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e68">Implementation of Inheritance Tax: Whether It Will Be Implemented Regionally Is Currently Unknown <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Inheritance tax is an important backbone of the direct tax system. The proposal to establish it dates back to 1915, but it was ultimately delayed due to frequent changes in the political situation. After the Second National Financial Conference, the Ministry of Finance devoted itself to the study of inheritance tax. However, due to the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, it was put on hold. In July 1938, the first National Political Council convened and decided to complete the legislative procedure for inheritance tax as soon as possible. The Legislative Yuan formulated 24 articles of the Inheritance Tax Law, which were promulgated by the National Government on October 6, 1938. The Ministry of Finance then drafted the Implementing Regulations for the Inheritance Tax Law in accordance with the provisions of the law, which were passed by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated on January 1, 1940. It stipulates that the property of the deceased, if within Chinese territory, or the property of the deceased in China or abroad, must be taxed. Taxable inheritance includes movable and immovable property. A uniform tax rate of 1% is levied on the total value of the inheritance above 5,000 yuan. If the total value of the inheritance exceeds 50,000 yuan, an additional tax is levied on the excess amount on a graded basis. If a deceased person leaves property that should be taxed in accordance with the law, the taxpayer, the estate administrator, or the executor of the will shall report the fact of the deceased's death and the general situation of the property to the local inheritance tax collection agency within ten days. It is reported that the inheritance tax has been implemented since the date of promulgation of the Implementing Regulations. Whether it will be implemented regionally is currently unknown.</p>

<p>The English-language "North China Daily News" reported that Fox, a Western police officer of the Hai Water Police Station, accompanied by two Chinese police officers, patrolled the Suzhou Creek by motorboat at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 15th). Near the Zha Pulu Bridge, they saw a boatman of a vegetable boat on the north bank having a dispute with several Chinese men in Western clothes. Fox and the two Chinese police officers went forward to mediate, but were attacked by the Chinese men with bamboo poles and other objects. Fox's shoulders, arms, and face were injured, and he was carried ashore. The two Chinese police officers were beaten even more severely. Fox pushed two of the assailants into the motorboat during the fight, but before he could lead the Chinese police officers to take the two men away, several Japanese from a vegetable shop on Wusong Road arrived at the scene and invited Fox to the shop, offered him paper cigarettes, and released the boatman and the two assailants. Fox then led several beaten boatmen back to the Water Police Station and identified several of the assailants who had beaten the boatmen ten days ago. It was found that these rioters were from a vegetable shop on Wusong Road. Ten days ago, when they committed the assault, several people were captured by the Water Police Station.</p>
<p>Soon, a Japanese person from the shop went to the Zhoujiazui Water Police Station and requested their release, and promised that no more assaults would occur. In order to settle the matter, the Water Police Station accepted the request in order to prevent the boats on the Suzhou Creek from being affected. However, despite this guarantee from the Japanese on Wusong Road, several similar incidents occurred within a few days. Yesterday, Fox was also beaten. The Water Police investigated this morning and found that the vegetables carried by the boat were partly supplied to the Wusong Road vegetable shop and mostly supplied to the Fujian Road vegetable shop. However, even though the people on Wusong Road vegetable shop got some of the vegetables, they still did not allow the boat to sail elsewhere, and when the boatman</p>
<p>attempted to sail away, he was severely beaten. One boatman, who was not yet twenty years old, had his left wrist severely cut by thugs with daggers. After the assault incident happened again and again, the customs water police authorities are now paying close attention to the Suzhou Creek. Two of the assailants were arrested. When interrogated by Sugiyama, the extra port affairs director of the customs, they claimed that they committed the assault at the instigation of the Japanese.</p>

<p>According to people from Wuxi, the railways near the county and Changzhou have recently been damaged by guerrilla forces, so vehicles may be in danger from time to time, and travelers are deeply vigilant. The mobile troops there are all under the Loyalty and National Salvation Army. A few days ago, the Japanese learned that the 10th Detachment of the army was very active, so they divided their troops and launched a fierce attack on Tangshiyan, Xihetou, Wencun, and other places. After the two sides encountered, the battle was fierce. However, in this battle, Xiang Zhenting, the deputy adjutant of the third battalion of the detachment, was surrounded and shot in the chest due to taking the lead. He was captured by the Japanese army and pushed into the river. After the Japanese army left, the villagers rescued him, but he eventually died due to severe injuries and cold. It is said that Xiang was a native of Hubei, 31 years old, and graduated from the Training Corps of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Headquarters. His wife and children are now living in Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e76">The Application for Relief for Hidden Poverty Is Overcrowded; The Distribution of Steamed Buns Is Carried Out with Great Effort; The Internal Affairs of the Abandoned Calendar Year Will Not Be Interrupted <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The United Relief Association of Charitable Organizations is conducting winter relief to help poor people on the streets. Since it started distributing steamed buns and ginger soup on Dagu Road a few days ago, the number of people receiving food every night has been very crowded. Currently, 32 bags of flour are used to make steamed buns every night, and it is still not enough to distribute. The association believes that this is a matter of urgent winter relief. Although the relief funds are exhausted, it is determined to maintain the original plan with great effort until the end of the abandoned calendar year. The second cold-proof shelter will also be expanded. It is hoped that benevolent people will generously assist. Yesterday, a meeting of the Zengji Gathering Restaurant decided that each person would save 10 yuan from the gathering fee, totaling 110 yuan from 11 people, to donate to the association to purchase steamed buns for distribution. Regarding the hidden poverty relief of the association, according to Mr. Cheng Tongsheng of the association, since the association started distributing clothing and rice to help the hidden poor, it has received hundreds of letters requesting relief every day. Due to the limited relief funds, it also takes time to investigate the addresses at the same time, so new requests have been temporarily suspended. According to the situation in recent days, the lives of citizens in Shanghai under high prices are indeed very miserable, which is a social problem that deserves serious attention at present.</p>

<p>In order to control the vegetable business in this city, the Japanese deliberately enclosed land behind the East Continental Bank warehouse and the Four Banks Warehouse on Guangfu Road in Zhabei to build a market. It was previously reported that the market would open on the 15th of this month. It is now learned that the market has repaired some of the houses destroyed by the bombing of the two warehouses and converted them into the "Shanghai Central Market." A row of corrugated iron houses has been built behind it, leaning against North Tibet Road. Two rows of corrugated iron houses have been built along Manchuria Road, all of which are ready. However, a section of the wall opposite the intersection of Alabaster Road on the north side and the internal cement ground have not been paved, and the work still requires time. Therefore, the opening must be postponed. However, a temporary small vegetable market set up at the Datong Road intersection on the west side (north end of Xinzha Bridge) near the market has been selling and buying. Once the market opens, it must be incorporated into the business.</p>

<p>After the Shanghai Dredging Bureau's dredgers were repeatedly negotiated by the Customs Tax Officer, the Japanese have agreed to return some of the various medium-sized dredgers. Therefore, the bureau's surveying and dredging sections have begun to prepare for resumption of work. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>藤泽竟尔 Arrived at the Bureau</p>
<p>According to a well-informed reporter from Datong, the position of Chief Engineer of the Shanghai Dredging Bureau has been taken over by the Japanese since the bureau was forced to reorganize. The first Chief Engineer, 藤泽竟尔, has now arrived at the bureau. It is noted that the Chief Engineer of the bureau has always been a British national. The employment of Japanese personnel is still a pioneering move. Currently, only a few large dredgers, such as the "Construction" and others, have been returned to the bureau by the Japanese. They are not suitable for work in the Huangpu River, so the ships are temporarily berthed on the Xinkai River and have not been used yet.</p>
<p>The Shipyard Will Also Be Returned</p>
<p>The dredging work in various sections of the Huangpu River has always been undertaken by medium-sized vessels, such as the "Seahorse," "Sea Tiger," "Sea Eagle," "Seal," "Sea Otter," and other dredgers, as well as the "Liyong," "Lijiang," and other survey vessels. The Japanese have not yet returned these vessels. After further negotiations by the Jianghai Customs authorities, the Japanese have agreed to return some more. After receiving the news, the bureau ordered the surveying and dredging sections to prepare for resumption of work. At the same time, the Japanese have also agreed to return the Zhanghuabang Shipyard. The bureau has decided to send technical personnel to the factory within days to inspect the extent of the damage and repair it accordingly.</p>

<p>Since Ningbo resumed navigation, passenger and cargo traffic has been exceptionally busy. The Ningbo Shipping Association has requested and been approved by the garrison headquarters to send the Kangsha, Yining, and Ou ships to transport accumulated goods back and forth. A few days ago, 600 dan of dry cocoons were transported to Shanghai, and another 700 dan will arrive within days. Since the arrival of dry cocoons from eastern Zhejiang, the silk factory authorities have resumed operations one after another to maintain the livelihood of their employees. Currently, the factories that have resumed work include Hongda on Xinjia坡 Road (239 machines), Hualun on Xiaoshadu Road (131 machines), Sanyi (East 160 machines) on Macau Road, Shanghai on Xiaoshadu Road (210 machines), Tongcheng on Xiaoshadu Road (300 machines), and Meilong on Xiaoshadu Road (165 machines), etc. The Yihua Silk Factory on Chengdu Road (500 machines) has declared a shutdown due to a shortage of raw materials. Therefore, the six silk factories currently in operation have a total of 1,205 machines. According to people in the industry, each machine reels about five catties of cocoons per day, so the 600 dan of dry cocoons that have arrived will only be enough to maintain the reeling for ten days. The next batch of cocoons transported to Shanghai will at most only be enough to maintain it for half a month.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration has separately stipulated the amounts of remittances and development drafts in various places in Zhejiang. According to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, the postal services in Pinghu, Changxing, Chongde, Linghu, Tangqi, Puyuan, Fanchang, Digang, and other places have been planned to be restored by the Shanghai Postal Administration in conjunction with the Zhejiang Postal Administration.

All small remittances and large and small packages are temporarily not restored. However, the Zhejiang Postal Administration will change the business based on the complexity of the postal services in various places from time to time. The postal bureaus in Jinhua and Yongkang have been changed from second-class bureaus to first-class bureaus, and the postal bureaus in Xieqiao and Shuiyang have been temporarily downgraded to agencies. Small remittances have also been temporarily suspended, and the Datong Postal Bureau has been returned to the jurisdiction of the Anhui district. The Bianxi and Hengban agencies under the jurisdiction of the former Yuhang Postal Bureau, and the Huanghu agency under the jurisdiction of the former Pingyao Bureau, are now all under the jurisdiction of the Lin'an Bureau, and small draft services have been restored.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Skilled Water Trade Association publicly denied the increase in skilled water prices and the soaring coal prices in newspapers, it has been deeply admired and sympathized with by all sectors. The association yesterday issued another declaration saying, "Loyal members, now the citizens of the entire 'Isolated Island' deeply admire our loyalty in not raising prices. It's just that we 'serve society.' The ironclad facts tell us rationally that as long as we remain calm and faithful and abide by our trade regulations, they have unlimited power to seek considerable benefits for all loyal members of the trade. Now, various public groups, charitable organizations, and the Shanghai media are all expressing sympathy, admiring our position very much, and are extremely willing to help us as much as possible within their means. Coal is our lifeline, so it is very serious. We should strive to unite and solve our most painful 'coal shortage.' We hope that everyone will pool their wisdom and efforts to support us. We should have a dauntless spirit to create a new life for our trade in the future." The association's committee members were recently discussing late into the night to solve the coal problem for the skilled water industry, hoping to adopt group coal purchases to help the industry and reduce expenses.</p>

<p>Mingwei, the three-year-old son of Chen Baoqing, a Ningbo native residing at No. 431 North Jiangxi Road, was playing at the door around 1 PM on the 14th when he was kidnapped by Deng Guixi from Jiangxi to a small inn in the French Concession to hide him and inquire about news. Chen Baoqing, after his son Mingwei disappeared, immediately reported to the police station and posted a reward notice at the door, stating that if someone found and returned his son, he would be willing to pay ten yuan. At 11 AM the next morning, the suspect Deng saw the reward notice and sent the child Mingwei back, falsely claiming that he saw the child crying lost on Bazilu, so he took him to the inn where he was staying in the French Concession temporarily. Later, he saw the reward notice posted at the door, so he brought him home, etc. Chen Baoqing offered to reward Deng six yuan, but he felt it was too little, and the two sides argued. Hua Constable No. 2107 arrived, inquired about the details, and took Deng to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the case and requested a postponement of the investigation. Questioning Deng Guixi, his confession was vague. Judge Huang Risheng ordered him to be remanded in custody and rescheduled for further verification.</p>

<p>The famous gangster Wu Zhonghua from Nanjing, nicknamed "Little Xizi," usually relies on his special influence to extort so-called protection fees from various guide companies, brothels, teahouses, and dance halls. Otherwise, he would resort to harsh means. The aforementioned venues, fearing his power, dared not disobey him in the slightest. Recently, Wu again used a false name to host a banquet at the Continental Hotel on Yuqiaqing Road, and the invitation stated that a gift of ten yuan was required, which was actually a method of extortion. After receiving the invitations, various guide companies and others sent gifts one after another. However, the matter was discovered by French Constable Fang Te of the Old Zhabei Police Station, who led Hua Constable No. 1013 of the Third Avenue and Hua Detective Cui Chengke of the Chengdu Road Police Station to Room 517 of the Continental Hotel, where they arrested Wu and his accomplices Xu Linfu, Xu Linian, and Shen Xiangrong and sent them to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Chuan Lin opened the Second Criminal Court for further questioning. The defendants hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend them. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the police station's investigation procedures had not yet been completed and requested another postponement. Representatives of Yang Guifei, Black Cat, Guangming, and other guide companies testified in court yesterday. However, Xu Mingnian and Shen Xiangrong were found to be unrelated and requested to be released first, etc. After Judge Fu questioned them, he ruled that the case be rescheduled for further questioning.</p>

Recently, his wife, Ma Xiuqing (26 years old this year, residing at No. 4, Lane 169, Taisidelang Road), hired lawyer Yin Tinghua to file a petition with the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court, requesting mediation to grant a divorce and order the defendant to pay alimony of 50 yuan per month until the age of 50, totaling 15,000 yuan over 25 years. It is alleged that the petitioner and the defendant were married in the 21st year of the Republic (1932) through matchmakers. After marriage, it was discovered that his</p>
<p>Actions Were Erratic and Incoherent, Sometimes Insulting, Scolding, and Beating, Beyond Reason. Recently, it has become even worse. Since the Battle of Shanghai, the petitioner took refuge in her mother's home because her family home in Nanshi was in the war zone, and it has been two years now. The defendant sometimes comes to insult, scold, and whip her unconsciously, and the defendant has no reproductive function and suffers from a serious and incurable Jingfu disease, and there is no hope for children. In summary, the petitioner's lifelong happiness has been completely lost, making cohabitation unbearable, which is obvious. Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of Article 1052, Item 1, Section 8 of the Civil Code,</p>

<p>Xu Li, an old woman from Suzhou, is 60 years old and has a daughter named Lan Yun, who is 20 years old this year. She used to be a prostitute in the Shidai Hua Changsan brothel on Yunnan Road in this city, with the prostitute name of Meimei. Later, she was transferred to the Qunyu Lane Wenhua brothel to work as a Yingwei. Hui Qi, or Hui Xiqi, from Wuxi, who runs the Hefeng Socks Factory at No. 13 Dingji Lane, Xiafei Road in the French Concession, is 40 years old this year. Because his wife is infertile, he originally intended to take a concubine to have children. Therefore, in the early summer of last year, at the invitation of a friend, he met Xu Lan Yun in the Shidai Hua brothel. The two fell in love at first sight and had a sense of meeting late. The two sides immediately agreed to start living together at the Continental Hotel. Not long after, Hui formally took her as a concubine and welcomed her home to live with his main wife in one place. Xu Li has now hired lawyer Xu Yin to file a petition with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, accusing Hui Qi of disrupting the family. The reason is that the defendant induced Lan Yun to cohabit, which is enticing a woman under the age of 20, and requesting that the defendant's crime be investigated and sentenced in accordance with Article 240 of the Criminal Law. After the court received the petition, Judge Wu Kechou opened a court hearing yesterday morning. The plaintiff appeared in court through her lawyer, stating the intention of the prosecution, and said that the plaintiff lives in Suzhou and only received the summons yesterday, so she sent a letter to inform her. She was unable to appear in court today and requested permission to reschedule the hearing so that she could appear in court next time. The defendant Hui Qi and his defense lawyer appeared in court, admitting that he took Lan Yun as a concubine and that she has now returned to Suzhou. He has sent letters and posted notices to negotiate. After the court verified the statements, it ruled that the hearing be rescheduled. The defendant was ordered to be released on bail pending further instructions.</p>

This attracted the attention of bad people, and three intruders broke in last night around 8 PM. One person took out a pistol, threatened and intimidated him, and forced him to hand over the remittance. Liu told the truth, saying that the money had already been transferred to someone else and was not his. The bandits searched for a while but found nothing, so they became angry with Liu and fired a shot, hitting him in the right waist. The bullet went through, and he bled profusely. Seeing that they had caused a major disaster, the bandits roared and fled. The wounded man was rushed to the Red Cross Hospital by the school's staff.

<h3 id="e101">Finance Bullish Sentiment in Foreign Exchange Market Persists <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no fluctuations in HSBC's listed rates. The unofficial exchange rates for British and American currencies remained weak. If it weren't for buying activity from foreign firms (such as in cotton, wheat, and oil) and HSBC's substantial purchases at midday, the weakening trend would have been quite noticeable today. This is because ordinary speculators, alarmed by the worsening European war, are feeling increasingly uneasy and are entering the market to sell. Moreover, the weakness in the Hong Kong exchange market has intensified fears, prompting a flight of capital to Shanghai for safety, without hesitation. As a result, market positions have consistently remained saturated in recent days. Congestion in Hong Kong's telegraphic transfers (telex) is also a contributing factor. Occasionally, inexperienced players, like a certain bank eager to sell, ultimately covered their short positions at 0.046875 and 0.09375.</p>
<p>As for the day's specifics, the market opened flat. Subsequently, due to continued selling by speculators and a certain bank's eagerness to sell, but with strong demand from foreign firms, the weakening trend was gradual. Around 10:15 AM, Hong Kong telex also experienced congestion, with prices at 4 shillings 8 and 59375/100000 and 8.0625 yuan. Shortly after, with foreign firms not increasing their purchases but the supply from inexperienced players remaining substantial, the market stagnated. Around 11:30 AM, HSBC suddenly bought American dollars at a low price for spot delivery, causing the market to briefly weaken, with 4 shillings 8 and 4375/100000 and 8.03125 yuan proving difficult to settle. However, the re-emergence of Chinese merchants selling soon caused the market to firm up again. In the afternoon, Chinese merchants sold again, coupled with another instance of Hong Kong telex congestion, gradually strengthening the market, resulting in a closing price of 4 shillings 8 and 90625/100000 and 8.09375 yuan. The trend for futures mirrored that of spot prices, but the distance between the January and February contracts slightly narrowed. For swaps, inexperienced players were still offering discounts of 0.0125.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Outflow of Funds is Substantial</p>
<p>Early in the morning, London's large transactions, both near and far, fell by 0.0625. The price of silver in New York remained flat. The price of gold in London remained steady. Exchange rates for British pounds against US dollars, Shanghai yuan, and French francs were offered at par. The US dollar was up by half a cent against the British pound, up by 0.1 yuan against the Shanghai yuan, and up by 0.025 yuan against the French franc. The central bank's listed rates for all currencies remained unchanged. Banks opened the morning with spot selling prices of 4 shillings 8 and 4375/100000 for British gold and 8.03125 yuan for American dollars, with no change from the previous closing prices. After the opening, Chinese merchants resumed selling, also closing out their long positions for the current month, causing a slight firming. Sales to foreign firms, such as Unilever's North China branch, included American dollars for spot delivery at 8.0625 yuan and American dollars for the current month at 8.03125 yuan. HSBC's listed exchange rates were announced and remained unchanged. The silver equalization tax was announced at a small 0.0425. Afterward, although foreign firms bought at a low price, a certain bank's selling appetite was also strong, so there was no impact. Around 10:15 AM, Hong Kong telex suddenly offered British gold (15,000 pounds) at 4 shillings 8 and 59375/100000 to inexperienced players. At that time, foreign firms such as Mobil were closing out American dollars for the current month at 8.03125 yuan and 8.00 yuan with Unilever's North China branch and a certain bank, as well as American dollars for February at 7.875 yuan, thus the process was stable. Around 11:20 AM, HSBC bought American dollars for spot delivery at 8.0625 yuan and 8.03125 yuan from banks such as Chase Bank, causing the situation to briefly soften slightly to 4 shillings 8 and 4375/100000 and 8.03125 yuan, which was difficult to settle at one point. Eventually, with the resurgence of selling by Chinese merchants, the market firmed up again. Until the afternoon close, banks' spot selling prices were 4 shillings 8 and 59375/100000 for British gold and 8.03125 yuan for American dollars, with British pounds slightly weaker by 0.015625 compared to the morning opening, and American dollars unchanged.</p>
<p>British and American Exchange Rates Continue to Weaken</p>
<p>In the afternoon, speculators continued to sell off, selling American dollars for spot delivery at 8.0625 yuan and American dollars for February at 7.9375 yuan to foreign firms, further strengthening the market. Later, Hong Kong telex again entrusted a Chinese firm to sell British gold for spot delivery to a foreign firm at 4 shillings 8 and 90625/100000, making the situation even more favorable. Until the evening close, banks' spot buying prices were 4 shillings 8 and 90625/100000 for British gold and 8.09375 yuan for American dollars. British gold for the current month was 4 shillings 8 and 875/100000, and American dollars were 8.0625 yuan. British gold for the next month was 4 shillings 8 and 828125/1000000, and American dollars were 8.00 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous day, spot and current month British pounds weakened by 0.046875, while American dollars strengthened by 0.09375. February British pounds lengthened by 0.0625, while American dollars cheapened by 0.0125.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Gold Market Deteriorates Daily, Long Positions Reduce Prices to Sell <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold bullion unofficial market continued to decline, falling to a new low for the year. This was primarily due to weak demand from the Hong Kong trading group and a weakening exchange market, leading to long positions reducing prices to sell. However, the morning opening was still stable at 4,068 yuan. Subsequently, due to the slight weakening of the exchange market, cash gold firms and securities firms sold off. But at that time, a certain money exchange firm repeatedly bought on behalf of its clients, so the decline was still gradual. Then, as buying support weakened, and gold firms, silver shops, and a certain bank were all willing to sell, the price fell to a closing price of 4,052 yuan at noon. The situation was calm in the afternoon, fluctuating only by 3 yuan. However, due to the continued strengthening of foreign exchange and securities firms again entering the market on behalf of floating holders, the result was a low closing price of 4,050 yuan, another 16 yuan lower than the previous day. Overall trading was lackluster, still only about 600-700 taels. Gold jewelry in silver shops remained stable. Gold from customs, etc., remained flat.</p>
<p>Gold Bullion Continues to Decline</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (10 taels) opened relatively stable. Initially, a certain silver shop bought 20 taels from a cash gold firm for 4,068 yuan, 2 yuan higher than the previous closing price. Shortly afterward, due to the slightly weaker exchange market, gold firms and securities firms came to sell, falling by 8 yuan. A securities firm sold 20 taels to a money exchange firm for 4,060 yuan. At that time, a certain silver shop came to buy again, and the money exchange firm also followed suit, raising the price by 5 yuan. A certain silver shop bought 30 taels from a gold firm for 4,065 yuan. Subsequently, as the exchange market remained weak, coupled with cash gold firms, silver shops, and a certain bank actively competing to sell, and customer demand weakening, supply exceeded demand, and the price fell again, dropping by 15 yuan. A silver shop sold 20 taels to a securities firm for 4,050 yuan. Afterward, a money exchange firm took advantage of the cheap price to buy back in, rising by 4 yuan. A money exchange firm bought 10 taels from a securities firm for 4,054 yuan. However, due to another money exchange firm and securities firm mutually selling, the price fell again to 4,050 yuan. Later, a certain money exchange firm bought dozens of taels, raising the price by 2 yuan, buying 20 taels from a gold firm for 4,052 yuan, setting the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the first purchase was a money exchange firm buying 20 taels from a gold firm for 4,052 yuan. Later, a certain bank bought 20 taels from a money exchange firm for 4,053 yuan. After the evening, foreign exchange was reported weaker, and securities firms came to sell again, falling by 3 yuan. A securities firm sold 10 taels to a money exchange firm for 4,050 yuan, the previous night's closing price. As a result, it was another 16 yuan lower than the previous day. It was found that it had fallen for three consecutive days, totaling 45 yuan, with fluctuations of 18 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash gold firms' own brand gold was a few yuan higher than bullion gold, while the buying price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current premium for spot gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and very few trades were made.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Remains Stable</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry in silver shops remained unchanged. Da Tong Hang still held at 410 yuan per tael. Xin Tong Hang was the same as the above price, with the buying price reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's discount rate for bills of exchange first fell sharply and then slightly rebounded. The discount per thousand yuan once fell to less than 20 yuan.

<h3 id="e105">Grains: 10 Yuan Flour Price Realized Yesterday <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of second-grade flour increased by another 0.2 yuan, actually reaching the 10 yuan mark. Retail sales were completely suspended, causing the market to become increasingly tight. Returned goods were priced 0.6-0.7 yuan higher than the factory price. At the same time, foreign flour also took the opportunity to move up. The opening price for foreign "Sailor" brand had already risen to 10.085 yuan. The difference between "Double Eagle" brand and other brands was only a few cents. The factory price of "Phoenix" brand flour from Japanese factories was 10.05 yuan. With rice prices falling, flour prices were more expensive than rice, dealing a major blow to flour-based foods and dim sum.</p>
<p>Wheat remained scarce yesterday, with factories unwilling to sell even at the high price of 18 yuan. It was rumored that Japanese factories and hoarders continued to absorb supplies, with approximately 4,000-5,000 bags traded.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Rice Prices Decline, Gradual Hope <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>After a brief decline in the rice market, the opening hand yesterday was weak, and the prices of various goods were difficult to maintain. General retail merchants were unwilling to sell lightly due to their own capital constraints. Returned goods, seeing the market turn soft, were mostly sold off. Thin rice, with the continued transfer of 500-600 bags of green-shelled rice from Hongkou, resulted in prices depreciating by 0.3-0.5 yuan. The special Qing Si thin rice sold for only about 37.5 yuan. Other thick japonica and early/late rice market goods were scarce, but were still inevitably affected by small declines of 0.02-0.03 yuan. Yangjian was not traded. Only more than 30 bags of second-grade Lujian were traded, priced at 36.5 yuan. Only Baiyuan, with demand from rice porridge stands and cake shops, had slightly broader sales channels and no changes. High-quality Changli rice still sold for around 38 yuan, and Customer Yuan also sold for 35.35 yuan. As for various foreign rice varieties, although old Saigon was firmer than new goods, it was difficult to support the current weak situation, seeing a decline of 0.1-0.2 yuan. First-grade opened at 37.3-37.4 yuan, and second-grade at 36.2-36.3 yuan. New goods depreciated by about 0.5 yuan. Da Jiao sold for only 36.5 yuan. The sales channel for Tokyo Jianjian was even more sluggish, falling by 0.5-0.7 yuan to 33.5 yuan, and second-grade fell to 32.7-32.8 yuan. Siamese broken rice was 33 yuan, and 32.7 yuan. Saigon rice bran was 30 yuan, and second-grade was 29.5 yuan, also reduced by 0.3-0.5 yuan compared to before. It is estimated that the total transaction volume for the entire city was no more than 4,000-5,000 bags.</p>
<p>The arrival of foreign rice has been very strong in recent days. In addition to Saigon shipping directly to Shanghai, there are many more shipments from Hong Kong. Yesterday, various Taikoo and other ships were unloading goods. Moreover, yesterday's telegrams showed that international prices had returned to flat. Although Saigon first- and second-grade were difficult to match, broken rice had quite a bit of traffic. Yesterday, recycled broken rice was only asking for 33 yuan. Importers thought the trend in the Shanghai market was not appropriate. Due to the upcoming flat rice sales, the market was even more stagnant. Prices continued to be reduced by 0.1-0.3 yuan. According to this newspaper's investigation, both the "Yi Lun" and "Zha Hua" ships were specially loading goods and were expected to arrive around the end of the month.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Market Turns Steady <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The soybean market situation is that the source is not strong, and the sales channels are quite smooth, so the market is strong. Yesterday, the trend was slightly stable. Due to the lack of high-quality goods, the prices of medium- and low-quality goods have been increased too much. The general market, mountain pressing oil mills, and local street firms and storage in South China and Hong Kong handled 2-3 cars of Wuhu beans, priced at 19.45 yuan; 1 car of Nanjing beans, 18.2 yuan; 1,000 bags of Dingjia Zhou beans, 19.4-19.6 yuan; 50 bags of Taicang Doudou, 21 yuan; and 600 bags of Chongming Sha Huang, 19.47-19.5 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's securities unofficial market showed quite a chaotic situation. Large holders stopped adding to their long positions, and the demand from various trading groups also gradually weakened. This kind of trance-like phenomenon is said to be related to suspicion of interest issues. In fact, the interest payment method has been publicized in newspapers, fortunately, it is not far away, about ten days or so will see the difference. Recently, or will temporarily within a small range to hover for a time. Yesterday morning the selling atmosphere was strong, and the 16th and 38th were in the process of "Enter 5, Out 3". "Lianyi", "Hongkang", and "Hongda" slightly absorbed, but the selling atmosphere was relatively high, and "Tongkang" and "Tiansheng" mostly sold. The 20th and "Dafeng" also had considerable recovery. "Taifeng" and "Xinfu" also sold out. The market slowly trended towards weakness. The initial selling price in the afternoon remained extremely weak, with type "E" sold at 0.01 yuan and type "C" sold at 0.03 yuan, still lacking buyers. Later, the 41st suddenly had a larger purchase, but at the same time, "Tongkang" supply was also very strong, and "Xinfu" and "Dafeng" absorbed a lot of volume. Sellers took advantage of the trend to lift prices, and slowly rose slightly. The market prices ultimately showed mixed gains and losses, ranging from 0.05 yuan to 0.3 yuan. The total transaction volume was approximately 700,000-800,000 yuan. A summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Transactions: Traded 10 shares of Ning Shao Steamship Company stock, priced at 8.1 yuan per share.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market at the Public Industry Exchange opened quietly. After a while, the trend of profit-taking suddenly prevailed, and the momentum was violent. All rubber shares were stirred, plunging rapidly (whether this is related to the Dutch situation and the fall of the Dutch currency). When the morning market closed, the original price had fallen nearly one-tenth. Although the selling spree was also infecting industrial shares, in addition to picking up low-priced rubber shares when various shares fell, the number of genuinely large profit-taking buyers was also small.</p>
<p>London, 15th. Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign bonds: Customs-guaranteed bonds' Sino-French American dollars (with seal) and Reconstruction Loan (British issue) each fell by 2 pounds, with the former being 50 pounds and the latter being 40 pounds. The rest were flat.</p>

<p>The yarn market is gradually improving, because demand from Hong Kong and Tianjin for coarse yarn is relatively strong. At the same time, foreign cotton has also turned upwards, making the market even stronger. However, transactions for 20-count yarn are still unremarkable. However, the general bulls' thinking has turned richer again, and have started to buy in and add to positions. Moreover, the foreign exchange situation is still on the horizontal line, coupled with the near end of the lunar calendar, account books are also coming to an end.</p>
<p>The current yarn opened in the morning because foreign cotton recovered, plus the northern 10-count coarse yarn transactions still had a stomach for it, and Hong Kong was more active than in the past. Therefore, the bulls were excited again. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse was 720 yuan. Subsequently, Guangdong had a little buying, and the market slowly rose to 727 yuan. A statistical study of transactions of half a day: 2,790 packages. The market: 20 count double horse rose 8 yuan, Tiannv rose 7 yuan, double earth rose 6 yuan. Yong'an factory opened 350 packages of 20 count special Jincheng, priced from 713-724 yuan, 250 packages of 32 count, priced at 935 yuan, 450 packages of 10 count Jia He, priced at 525 yuan. Today, 175 pieces of export yarn were shipped to Hong Kong and 65 pieces were shipped to Haiphong. The amounts bought by various trading groups are listed separately as follows: Colleague 1235 Hong Kong 985 Tianjin 470 Ningbo 70 Jiangxi 20 Mainland 18 Statistics 2798</p>

<p>Although there is no large-scale development of local cotton transactions, the volume of transactions is more than yesterday's, but most is still fellow traders buying and selling American cotton which is slightly better. The factory has yet to start purchasing so morale is still unremarkable. However, the source of cotton in northern Jiangsu is again withering. At the dock, 109 packages of ordinary cotton arrived, 101 packages of Changyinsha, and 930 packages of Beisha. The details of current cotton transactions are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Another message is the foreign cotton market: New York cotton market, this morning's opening was extremely active. First, speculators bought. Later, the spot merchants bought, and the Liverpool market bought it. Therefore, the market was quite firm. In the end, the closing price rose by more than 17-20 pounds over the previous day. Indian (including forecasts) rose more than 1 rupee. Egyptian rose more than 50 pounds Pu, and Liverpool rose more than 10 pence.</p>
<p>Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transactions: Yesterday, the surge in the overseas cotton market caused the morale was particularly excited. Yesterday, there were those asking for purchases from various places. Among fellow traders there was trading so it was still quite active. However, the factory transactions were still unusually quiet, and the Japanese manufacturers had not started purchasing. The price the cotton market using the $8 USD exchange rate is listed below:</p>

<p>Yesterday, the price of eastern white cloth rose due to the continued development of actual sales by local merchants. The price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth surged by 0.25 yuan per piece, with the closing price bid at 22.25 yuan. The price of each brand of fine twill increased by 0.05-0.1 yuan. The Tianjin merchants continued to purchase nearly 1,000 pieces of Dragon Head colored ball and other fine cloths. The local street dragged to purchase 600-700 pieces of mid-range fine cloth. Therefore, the futures opening period for the next month was uniformly increased. The morning opening price for Dragon Head fine cloth in February was 22.6 yuan. Later, it needed 22.75 yuan. The morning opening futures price for Yanghe Colored Ball was 22.5 yuan. It was also subsequently increased by 0.1 yuan, and the trend was very firm. On the 17th, 150 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Yesterday's silk market fell sharply. New York's near-term fell by 0.115 yuan and the far-term fell by 0.15 yuan. Yokohama's spot price fell by 80 yuan and the far-term fell by 135 yuan. The local Shanghai silk market also saw a setback. Yesterday, Renji and other firms traded 120 loads of white factory silk, priced at 5,600 yuan, down about 700-800 yuan compared to the previous high. Jili, etc., fell by about 500 yuan, with the special premium price at 3,300 yuan and the top number at 3,000 yuan, but no transactions were made.</p>

<p>The price rise for various bituminous coal goods is becoming more and more intense. The reason is that retail sales are strong, and the local street factories' demand is smooth, resulting in the market's available goods gradually being sold out. The selling price is rising daily. Yesterday, both high- and second-grade goods increased by 5 yuan. It is estimated that the Kolkata coal of India, fellow traders disassembled, cost 135 yuan per ton, lower body screening debris 118 yuan, and Vietnamese coal 80 yuan, also plus 5 yuan. The above are all goods leaving the warehouse. The handling fee charged by the firm plus what they will bring to the customer will be adding another 6.00 yuan in prices.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market was very quiet with few transactions. The association's designated price hardly changed. The spot price of 24 coarse white was 56.5-56 yuan, the re-exported price was 45.5 yuan, and Taikoo's "Vehicle White" B brand East Warehouse was 57.5 yuan and West Warehouse was 58 yuan.

Mu Xianbai Zhenji brand was 56 yuan, second grade was 55.5 yuan, first grade Benru was 67.5 yuan, and Jing Mingru was 68 yuan. The domestic sugar brand remains tight. It is reported that the "Diao Qing" producing area will be controlled and will temporarily lack shipments. However, the firm said the sales are also few, and they are not eager to advance, resulting in a state of holding off.</p>

<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>Time—6 PM</p>
<p>Characters—Sister-in-law Wang, Mother Zhang, Mother Qiao, Old Man Sun, Qiao</p>
<p>Setting—An ordinary living room.</p>
<p>(Opening Scene—Sister-in-law Wang, Mother Zhang, Mother Qiao, and Old Man Sun are playing mahjong.)</p>
<p>Wang   Mother Qiao, your daughter, the day before yesterday, I saw with my own eyes, saw her walking closely with a young man in a Western suit on the main street… such an ugly sight!</p>
<p>Mother Qiao (quickly, busy or not) Who can control her, thank goodness that she is earning money after the death of her father. She is a girl who will eventually belong to someone else, so let her be. (She received a good card and a smile appeared on the corner of her mouth.)</p>
<p>Sun   Indeed, girls are earning money more easily than boys these days! My eldest son studied accounts for nearly ten years, but he can't even compare to this old man. Day and night he just wants to date girls, spend money on parties, and makes some fair-weather friends. If you ask him to properly find some business to do, he can't do this or that.</p>
<p>Zhang  (concentrating on playing mahjong, as if she didn't hear what others were saying) Old Man Sun, be quick, it's all you, talking at length. Look, we've spent a full four hours playing mahjong. (Then look at how much the house is taking and how many cigarettes are left…)</p>
<p>Sun   (unconvinced) I didn't want to play mahjong! Mother Zhang, you should know. Didn't you say that you were one short? I'm already overwhelmed with taking care of the child and cooking!</p>
<p>Wang, Zhang, Qiao (in unison) Is Old Man Sun's wife sick again?</p>
<p>Sun   I'm really losing money taking care of this woman. She is always missing her child so often that she ends up sick every other day. I don't know how much I've already spent on medical expenses. She's been getting crazier these last few days, hitting, scolding, kicking, doing everything she can. But the children are not making me feel proud, so what can this old bone do?</p>
<p>Mother Qiao   Once you get old, you hope for children, like me, is it not? If it weren't for Qiao, I don't know what kind of situation I'd be in.</p>
<p>(Qiao rushes in wearing bright red and green clothes.)</p>
<p>Qiao  Mom, you're playing with "Zhao Tiansheng". What are you playing? I have to go out, and there is no one to take care of the house. (She wants to leave quickly.)</p>
<p>Mother Qiao  Ah! Zhao… wait a moment, my child… Heavens, I dreamed last night… Zhao Tiansheng? Eight dollars, eight dollars…</p>
<p>(Her vision blurred, and she could no longer clearly recognize the tiles on the table.)</p>
<p>Qiao   Mom, what's wrong! (casually) Oh, here's ten dollars. Move it over and use it as gambling money… Also, I want to tell you, I have some things to do tonight, maybe I won't be back until dawn tomorrow morning… (and ran out after she said that.)</p>
<p>Mother Qiao  Ten dollars, today's mahjong is settled. Haha, haha (laughs loudly)</p>
<p>Sun, Wang, Zhang  (also laughing loudly) Haha, haha, hahahahaha…</p>
<p>……(Curtain falls)</p>
<h3 id="e116">A Record of Reading Paintings at Ping Qi's Studio <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Having nothing to do on Sunday, I visited Ping Zhai's "rotten residence" to appreciate paintings, through a friend's introduction.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Jingbo, the owner of Ping Zhai, is a collector and a painter himself. He's friends with Feng Chaoran, Wu Hufan, Wang Shengzhi, Ye Gongchuo, etc., and they spend their days together, appraising famous paintings and calligraphy. This kind of life fills an outsider like me with great envy. He graciously took out his collection of famous paintings and calligraphy, one by one, and patiently unfolded them for me to enjoy.</p>
<p>The first thing I saw was the "Spring Scenery of Lake Tai" hanging on the wall, a mirror screen. This was Feng Chaoran's copy of Wu Yushan's original, collected by Wu Kezhai. It took him ten days to finish this painting. The rural scenery reminded me of my first impression of Qing Yang, with similar long embankments, willows, and small animals, making me lost in thought.</p>
<p>Next, I looked at his collection of calligraphy and paintings. There was a "Spring Dawn in Jiangnan," a long hand scroll by a painter from the Song Dynasty Painting Academy. It depicted children playing chess, village oxen grazing, fishermen casting nets, and post horses delivering messages. In the center, prominent peaks maintained the balance of the left and right sides, with excellent composition. The lyricist Zheng Wenzhuo inscribed that although the painting had no signature, it was common for members of the Song Dynasty Painting Academy not to sign their works. They preferred to be anonymous artists, inscribing their names on rocks, unwilling to be known. From this perspective, one can see the lofty and unconventional spirit of the painter. Zhao Zuo's landscape scroll from the Ming Dynasty was particularly long. As I unrolled it, it truly felt like the lines of poetry: "Mountains and rivers exhausted, suspecting there is no road. Willows dark, flowers bright, another village." My heart was broadened and my spirits lifted. The silk painting "Mountain Pavilion" by Lu Zhi from the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty was also extremely simple and lovely.</p>
<p>What particularly caught my attention among modern calligraphy and paintings were the works of Wu Changshuo, Ren Bonian, and the calligraphy of Shen Meisou. Wu Changshuo's four-panel screen depicted cold-resistant flowers and trees like pine, plum, and chrysanthemum, representing nobility and integrity, which I greatly admired. I especially loved the inscription on the chrysanthemum panel: "If discussing past events with Yuanming, it is unbearable to recall the Yixi years." The meaning of these two lines is profound. Ren Bonian painted a side profile of the Jin Dynasty calligrapher Wang Xizhi, with a young boy by his side and geese by the shore. I liked both the brushwork and the subject matter. Shen Meisou's calligraphy (studied by the modern Chen Zhu) was like artificial mountains and strange rocks, almost like a painting, full of peculiar interest. The inscription by Zhu Qiangcun at the end also made me linger with delight.</p>
<p>In addition, Wu Qiunong's "Listening to Pine in Thatched Pavilion" used the poetic meaning of Zhu Zhuyu, also unconventional. Lu Lianfu's fruit arrangement was so vividly colored that each fruit seemed to have dewdrops on it. Among Wu Pingzhai's paintings, the composition of "Returning Sails on a Stone Cliff" was the best. A lone boat was placed under a steep cliff, arranged with great care. There were also calligraphy by Gao Yong and Yang Xian, court ladies by Zheng Mukang, boneless green landscape by Xiao Chu, Cai Songyuan, and landscape albums by Gu Xuepo. It was truly a dazzling array, too beautiful to take in all at once.</p>
<p>Zhu Jingbo's own small landscape paintings were delicate and beautiful. Perhaps he himself didn't pay much attention to them, but I liked them very much. In his "Moon Wave Building Flower Painting Album," I liked the poetic charm of "Sleeping Sparrows on Treetops," the balance of the plum blossoms, the sparseness of the swallows and willows, and the strangeness and freedom of the lotus flowers. Wu Mei's inscription said: "Use your own method, write the heart and write the spirit. Three hundred paintings of Goose Creek, each stroke asks for your skill." The jest was wonderful!</p>
<p>I heard that the owner of Ping Qi's studio will hold an exhibition of ancient and modern calligraphy and paintings at the Great China Company from the 17th to the 19th. I will definitely go and see it then, because what I saw now was only a small part of it, and it has already given me much pleasure. I am sure it will be a great delight to see the entire collection of Ping Qi's studio soon.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 19: Seeing Flowers and Enjoying the Moon, a Household is Established; Planting Jade and Conceiving Pearls, There is Skill in Pregnancy</p>
<p>The two Miss He wanted to talk to Lin Jiancheng about building factory houses. Today is his wedding day, and they thought he must be very busy and unable to discuss these matters in detail. But what about after the wedding? Miss He was afraid they would go on a honeymoon trip. They had both taken a month's leave, and who knew when they would return from this trip. Although the construction of the factory houses wouldn't start immediately, there were various procedures to go through in Free Village, such as demarcating land, filling foundations, and waiting for the architect to survey the land and draw up plans. However, people are always impatient. In the minds of the two Miss He, it would be best if a factory house immediately sprang up on the open space in Free Village. After contacting Uncle Jiang tomorrow and receiving the investment, they could start building the factory house. It would be best to invite Lin Jiancheng to take a look at Free Village. But their honeymoon trip was also the most joyful thing in life and couldn't be stopped. They just didn't know when they would return from their trip. Later, they asked Wu Junsu and learned that they were not going on a honeymoon trip that night, which relieved them. Wu Junsu gave them an idea, telling them, "Although this newly married couple is not going on a honeymoon trip that night, they will give Mrs. Suriya a test ride in the family travel car in a few days, traveling to various places. They have also invited the sisters to ride in the car together, and she will definitely come. Why don't you discuss with Miss He, and have them swing by Free Village on their honeymoon trip? That way, Engineer Lin can survey the terrain, draw up plans, and have a clear idea." He Liyu said, "That's a great idea. Since they are not going out on a honeymoon trip that night, we can discuss it with them tomorrow or the day after. They can take a look at Free Village during their trip." At three o'clock in the afternoon, the well-wishers at the Grand Hotel gradually increased. Among these well-wishers were people from various countries, especially from the United States, Britain, and France. The Americans and British were mostly friends of Mrs. Suriya and Yu Dan Yun. The French were mostly friends of Lin Jiancheng, because Lin Jiancheng had studied in France. Originally, the guides dispatched by the National Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Government were also divided into several categories. For example, in several countries in Asia, there were guides for guests from Asian countries; in several countries in Europe and America, there were guides for guests from those countries. Furthermore, people were assigned separately between Asia, Europe, and the Americas. For example, in India, Japan, the Philippines, the Soviet Union, Turkey, and various South American countries, one generally had to be able to speak the language of that country to be a guide for people from that country. Otherwise, if the language is not understood, the feelings would be estranged. It is precisely:</p>
<p>Don't say that the five continents manage the households,</p>
<p>You must know that all the seas are brothers.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Every Drop in My Heart <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Chang Fang</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cooked Water Trade Association, upon discovering that Ji Jianming and others not in the trade, such as Yu Liyang, were using the name of the cooked water trade to raise prices in the newspaper without authorization, convened an emergency meeting the day before yesterday. As the price increase was related to the livelihood of all citizens, it was unanimously agreed not to raise prices again.</p>
<p>Cooked water costs one cent for two ladles, and each ladle costs twenty cash. At first glance, the price increase is only five cash per ladle. With the price of white rice at forty yuan per picul, this small amount shouldn't affect the livelihood of citizens much. However, the coal stove that only burns for one meal in the morning goes out, and people eat lunch and dinner soaked in cooked water. The majority of Shanghai citizens are living this kind of life. Their lives have already been lowered, to the point where they have to be frugal even when drinking a sip of water. If the price of cooked water increases by five cash per ladle, how can they not feel "every drop in my heart" like ice water when they drink it?</p>
<p>Therefore, the cooked water trade's painful operation is truly admirable. However, the soaring price of coal is also a fact. What will happen when "tolerance" is no longer "tolerable"? Therefore, the main task is not "painful operation" but "suppressing and stabilizing prices." The small amount of five cash for cooked water already affects the livelihood of the majority of citizens, let alone forty yuan per picul of white rice?</p>

<p>Idle Talk of the Past</p>
<h3 id="e120">Tian Guifeng, the Leading Dan <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Wu</p>
<p>At the end of the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty, Tian Guifeng was the leading Dan. Tian, whose given name was Tongqiu and stage name was Xiao Guifeng, was popular for his romantic and delicate performances. His signature works included "Black Dragon Court," "Guan Wang Temple," "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet," "Playing the Phoenix," "Also Zhai," "Selling Cakes," and "Little New Year," among others. Today, Xiao Cuihua's performance of "Black Dragon Court" often includes interjections and jokes that were left by Tian. For example, in the play, when Song Jiang scolds Yan Poxi, he says, "Never hung up, never swept the floor... what kind of person are you?" And Yan replies, "Eating lotus root with one chopstick, you've poked my eye again." And Song also says, "Grandpa Song asks to sit down... don't you disrespect Grandpa Song?" Yan then replies, "Clumsy driving a cart, overturned again." In those days, coal was transported in the capital using two-wheeled carts pulled by mules and horses, and there were no paved roads. The ground was uneven, and the driver would occasionally overturn the cart if he wasn't careful. "Clumsy" is a local term in the capital, referring to someone who is strong but not intelligent. During an imperial examination in the late Qing Dynasty, Tian and Tan Xinpei performed at Guangxing Garden outside Chongwen Gate in the capital. That day, Tian performed the penultimate show, "Hongluan Jubilee," while Tan performed the final show, "Losing Jieting." However, after Tian finished performing, many audience members dispersed, leaving very few behind. Conversely, when Tian performed the final show and Tan performed the penultimate show, the audience was silent and didn't make a sound, and no one left their seats early. This was because most of the audience members were candidates taking the imperial examinations in the capital. They couldn't fully appreciate Tan's art, but they were all captivated by Tian's beauty, performance, and dialogue. This led to the lament that "Tian Guifeng was the best male singer in his later years, and Liu Xikui was the best female singer." The most enthusiastic supporter of Tian at the time was Ronglu, the first favorite minister of Empress Dowager Cixi and the Grand Tutor. Ronglu had an opium addiction, and Tian would go to Rong's residence every night to prepare opium for him. Over time, he also became addicted to opium, which damaged both his appearance and his voice. Unable to avoid it, he focused on "doing," so the workmanship in each of his plays reached perfection. As Tian was extremely well-liked by Rong, anyone who had a request of Rong would have it immediately granted with Tian's word. At that time, Rong was extremely powerful, so those eager for an official career knew the shortcut of Tian and would flock to Tian's residence late at night, carrying gifts to seek an introduction. Tian was poor, especially fond of antiques, and therefore had a rich collection. Tian also had the common ailment of artists in general: unwilling to easily pass on his skills to others. In his life, he only took two disciples, one male and one female: Shang Xiaoyun and Yun Piaoxiang.</p>
<h3 id="e121">After Watching "Chen Yuanyuan" <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>"Chen Yuanyuan" is divided into five acts. Due to space limitations, I will only briefly describe my personal opinions after watching it here. The focus of the whole play is on the second and fourth acts, and the third act introduces the character of Li Chuang. These three acts are enough for a "Biography of Wu Sangui"; the addition of the first and fifth acts is probably because the name of the play is "Chen Yuanyuan."</p>
<p>In terms of directing, the time spent in the pavilion in the first act, where Tian Guozhang hosts Wu Sangui's banquet, is too long. Also, the dim lighting obscures the actors' expressions, making it very dull. I think they should sit down after their main dialogue is over; sitting down should only be for show, to introduce Chen Yuanyuan's appearance. Chen Yuanyuan's two songs should also be changed, and it would be best to use a dance-song form for the second time, so that it can better echo Wu Sangui's emotions. In the third act, Wu Sangui's forcing his way into Li Chuang's palace and the sword-fighting scene are very far-fetched. Moreover, in terms of reason, having broken through the city gates, Wu Sangui would not have charged into the palace alone, and there would not have been enough time for Wu Sangui to fight Li Chuang twice. I think Wu Sangui must meet Li Chuang. After Li Chuang is shot with an arrow, he should take Chen Yuanyuan away, leaving Wu Sangui to meet his father. Ending with Wu Xiang scolding his son can also achieve a good effect. The fourth act is the most successful act in the whole play. Chen Yuanyuan's pain is sharp; Zu Dashou's conspiracy is exposed; Wu Sangui's regret is too late, which can move the audience everywhere. The fifth act uses Yang E's passion to set off Wu Sangui's "exit," which is the author's intention. However, I think the narration of the three palace maids at the opening, describing Wu Sangui's late-night indulgences, can be combined with Chen Yuanyuan's appearance, or Yang E and others can appear first, so as to reduce the excessive desolation on the stage.</p>
<p>Yan Jun's Wu Sangui is indeed not heroic enough, but compared to his past performances as Ximen Qing, there is progress. For example, he can control the emotional conflicts and contradictions in the second and fourth acts. Xia Xia's Chen Yuanyuan is better in the fourth act than in the first act, and the depression in the fifth act is obscured by Yang E and others' play. Zu Dashou is the key figure in the whole play, and the current actor is not enough to portray the deceit and danger of the "persuader," and his movements are too civilized. I hope he can restrain and correct himself at any time.</p>

<p>The beautiful Li Li of Beiping, at the end of last year, was invited by Yi Hua Company to come to Shanghai to shoot the costume film "Biyun Palace." At that time, Li Li still had unfinished business at the Art College in Hong Kong, so she stated that she could not stay for long. For this reason, Yi Hua Company's "Biyun Palace" rushed to shoot all the scenes about Li Li first, which took a month, including eighteen all-nighters. Li Li was very interested in this work. Whenever there was an all-night shoot, the owner of Yi Hua would give her a bottle of "Changyu Brandy" to relieve her exhaustion. It can be seen how well she was treated. It is said that Li Li's performance in "Biyun Palace" is very wonderful. Because Li Li played a costume role for the first time, she was completely focused, so she achieved this success. The film is scheduled to be screened at Huguang from 9:00 pm on the 18th.</p>

<p>Inner Court Servants of the Former Qing Dynasty (Continued)</p>
<p>In addition to performing operas, there were various kinds of music and acrobatics, such as Zhonghe music, Shifan, rope jumping, Korean somersaults, lion dances, magic tricks, octagonal drums, puppet shows, and poles. After the Gengzi year of Guangxu, Taiping songs, boy sticks, Yangge, and drums were added. Even if we only talk about performing operas, the actors on stage were called shangchangren, and the musicians who accompanied them with drums, flutes, strings, erhu, etc. were called suishou. Then there were those in charge of records, inspections, and colorful boxes. Furthermore, there were somersault performers who specialized in somersaults. How can everyone be called a servant? Therefore, I say that only those actors who enter the inner court to serve and have official ranks can be regarded as servants. (The chief manager used to be a sixth-rank official, but after the Shengping Department was changed, it was reduced to a seventh-rank official, and the deputy chief manager had no rank.) Until the nineteenth year of Guangxu, outside troupes were often called into the inner court to perform. At that time, the troupes included Six Happinesses, Little Dan Gui, Yucheng, Shishun, Heyishun, and Tongchun. Can the actors of a troupe who serve in the inner court today and still perform commercially tomorrow all be regarded as servants? The name does not match the reality, which is very clear. If it is true that Cheng Changgeng and Sun Juxian were rewarded with a sixth-rank official, this matter is not seen in the records, so if it is true, they can be regarded as servants. Did Tan Xinpei, who came to Shanghai during the Guangxu years and hung the plaque of inner court servant, ever receive an official rank? To be investigated. (Lao Tan entered the inner court in the sixteenth year of Guangxu, at the age of forty-two.) Among the famous actors who entered the Qing court in recent years who have passed away one after another, there are Sun Juxian, Chen Delin, Wang Changlin, Yu Yuqin, Gong Yunfu, Yang Xiaolou, Qiu Lirong (that is, Qiu Guixian), etc. The surviving ones are only Wang Yaoqing, Wang Fengqing, and Rui Debao. Even without official rank, they are still rare fruits.</p>
