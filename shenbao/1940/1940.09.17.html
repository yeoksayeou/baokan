<h3>越南畫定日本勢力範圍的檢討</h3>
<p>關於法日兩國所談判的越南問題，其結果影響，極大極遠，我們不能視如他家瓦上霜。到現在為止，談判內容究竟如何，雙方諱莫如深；察之法方聲明在曖昧，貝當態度的疲弱，外傳種種，雖極不利於法國，亦便人不能不信所傳的不大訛。昨日德國海通社又傳法國維希方面電訉，據稱法日談判已由兩國當局在原則上商定辦法；由法國畫出越南的東京與柬埔塞兩區，作為日本勢力範圍；此外各區仍由法國保持主權，但日本或將加以某種控制云。這亦是未經法國官方證實的消息，數日前已由別方面作此同樣報道；今則來自維希，傳之海通，尤使人不得不另眼看待而加以進一步的檢討。</p>
<p>談越南，一般人所有概念，或非十分明確。就歷史言；早屬中國版圖，秦始皇時代改封建為郡縣，其地屬象郡；及至五代以後，由割據而稱王國，但始終稱藩入貢；到一八八五年，由清朝顢顢頇頇的斷送了而淪為法屬；然其儀容，信仰，習慣，風俗，至今還同華夏。就地理言：在中國廣東廣西雲南三省之南，面積約二十八萬五千方英里，較法國本部大三分之一，較日本朝鮮台灣的總積大三萬餘方英里；東臨南海，西鄰暹羅緬甸，而控制暹羅灣。就政治言：全境分為五部分，北部稱東京，中部的東半稱安南，西半稱老撾，南部的西半稱柬埔塞，這四部各有小朝廷是法國的保護國；南部的東半稱交趾支那，纔是法國直屬的殖民地；中國或稱之為安南，或稱之為交趾，那是不足以指述全部的，故不總稱之為越南，而法國總稱之為印度支那</p>
<p>假定海通社所傳維希電訉而可信，則知日本所要取為勢力範圍的，是五部中的兩部。東京在北，與中國為鄰，所有海防，河內，勞開，諒山，皆在其內；氣候最佳，人口最密，水陸交通便捷，米煤產額豐富，實是越南的平原，亦精華所在。柬埔塞是越南的西南平原，其西北與暹羅接壤，其西南海綫抱住了暹羅灣；農礦物產，蔚為茂盛盜源。東京與柬埔塞兩部不相連屬，而日本卻何以不厭其割裂？此其顯見的一種原因，當然是侵略初步，先行分頭佈局，然後全境鯨吞。而其目前的主因，索東京區，即是包圍中國的西南；索柬埔塞區，則另有大欲。蓋柬埔塞除了經濟價值之外，還有重要的軍事價值。若以柬埔塞為根據：（一）更進一步，便是暹羅；（二）跨過克拉地峽，便是印度洋；（三）隔海與英屬馬來半島相望，離英國號稱遠東鎖鑰的新加坡軍港，約六百餘海里；（四）形成日本海陸空軍向西的最優良的最前綫；（五）陷美屬菲律賓於大包圍之中。至於柬埔塞族（即喀美爾族）文化水凖的較低，其地氣候的較熱，這在日本人取為殖民地的最適宜條件；祇要看他二三十年來移民於中國東三省的失敗，可作準確的反證。</p>
<p>所謂勢力範圍，在國際政治史上數見不鮮，然無明確而固定的定義，要視補充的具體條件而轉移。如這一次海通電訉所傳，有語謂『其他各區仍由法國保持主權』，則可見東京與柬埔塞兩區成為日本勢力範圍之後，兩區主權已不復為法國所保持，而將移讓入於日本之手。主權之不存，其他可想而知，這是變更了越南現狀何疑！於此說來，對於這種形態而僅稱之為勢力範圍，實是取珠還櫝，偷天換日的辦法啊！</p>
<p>維希政府何以如此斷送？德國政府何以假作痴聾？目前尙無確切的資料，可資說明；所可推想者；關於這樣遠大的問題，維希所得進退取舍者，至少為德國方面所默許；而德國對日本所取態度的剛柔，必與德國制勝英國的自信心的強弱，成為比例：即對英自信愈強，則對日態度愈剛；否則，反是。</p>

<h3>歐戰業談（七）　德國軍費的浩大</h3>
<p>關於德國備戰情形，本報前巳譯了一篇紐的泰晤士報訪員的報吿，茲再將Christian　Sciencw　Monitor所載德國軍費支出浩大情形，譯錄如下，與法國情形相對照，眞不可同日而語了：</p>
<p>德國軍費支出的總數，究至若干程度，尚難估計，但據美國商業部在歐戰爆發時所作的分析，可知一九三八年至一九三九年財政年度，德國軍費占全國收入百分之四十七。迄至現在，這種成數想巳增加不少。</p>
<p>德國在國際方面早已破產，在資源方面，又大感缺乏，何以能不顧經濟財政原則，如此羅掘呢?</p>
<p>在六年以前，德國對於黃金和外滙，都拮据到極點，信用破產，一切外債，也宣佈停付。那時沙赫脫是德國國家銀行總裁，不斷痛恨德國依賴國外原料，會向世界各國呼籲「妥協，容忍與親善」。就財政經濟方面講，那時德國似以到了山窮水盡的境地。</p>
<p>可是數月之內，德總理希特勒却又在加速進行規模宏大費用浩繁的擴軍計劃了。</p>
<p>去年秋季，他宣佈巳經爲擴張軍備，用去九〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇馬克。各國對此很難置信。其時德國貨幣，因其沒有金準備及在世界市塲上不能自由賣買的原故，折合美金究有若干，難於計算，但根據官方規定的滙率，的可折合美金三六，〇〇〇，〇〇○，〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>目前德國所用去的軍費，尙不得而知，但爲數之鉅，必無疑義。據英國方面估計，每年的須一五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元。其他方面的估計，則尙高出此數。</p>
<p>據經濟學家的解釋，以平時經濟的標準，來估計所能用於戰時的軍費一項原則，已不能適用。在一九一四年，各國經濟學家差不多都一致承認，德國在財政上，只能從事戰爭幾個月。但德國在上决世界大戰中耗費的金錢，除開生命的損失，產業的破毀，資金的减值，及貿易的損失不計外，統計下來，共達一八六，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元之多。的七倍了美國政府自一七八九年到一九一六年間的全部費用</p>
<p>在現代戰爭中，地面須用機械化部隊，天空須用飛機，其費用自必遠較一九一四年至一九一八年時代爲鉅，貧窮的德國如何能進行其征服全歐的冒險行動，吾人於此追溯到國社黨執政初期情形了。</p>
<p>希特勒在執政之始，卽發現德國啊人百分之三十失業，工廠停工，國庫缺少金錢去購進主要原料及食糧。在這樣的危機中，德國人民便順服的接受工業，勞工，貿易及金融的統制度，這種制度，在近代工業化的國家中，實未有前例</p>
<p>類似此項的統制制度，直至今日，仍有加無减。如果你是一個德國人，政府將吿訴你可以吃什麼，穿什麼，什麼地方去工作，什麼時間去工作，你可以得到多少工資，你的生活必需品應付出多少代價。</p>
<p>如果你是一個工業家，就將吿訴你得製造什麼，你得出售什麼，並且在你付了捐稅以後，剩餘的利潤，還應借給政府。如果你開了儲蓄銀行或保險公司，就將吿訴你的基金，　投資在什麼地方。</p>
<p>直到最近，英國政府才向國會取得了同樣獨攬的大權。政權集中是一個巨細不遺的龐大計劃，需時很久。希特勒進行這項計劃已有六年歷史了。</p>
<p>德國目前用來作戰的經費，不但取之於龐大的賦稅，不但借用了政府所能控制的人民的儲蓄，並且對於人民的生活，都規定其須嚴格犧牲。</p>
<p>就食物一項講，一個人每星期只能吃一磅肉。除此而外，只有白菜及番薯可條量的吃食。至於衣服，每年每人規定只能買幾件，每人所允許的分配數量，比之一個奏國囚犯，也還不如。婦女每年只准着四雙機。</p>
<p>據經濟學家解說，德國全國力量，都已配合起來爲作戰之用。工廠，住屋，及各機關的修理，如與作戰無關，皆予擱置。國家銀行現仟總裁芬克會在四月間發表談話，謂消費品的生產應加限制，商人應限制投資於裝修。一切儲蓄，應便於政府從儲蓄銀行及放款機關提取。</p>
<p>但除開加緊國內組織外，德國尙有向國外獲得重要原料的問題。煤，鐵煤油三項主要原料中，德國只有煤可以充分自給。國內生產的棉花，羊毛，銅，橡膠及其他大宗原料，都感缺乏。</p>
<p>然據國際貿易專家觀察，在戰前幾年，德國早已每年輸入大宗資源，其數量遠超過其平時需要。國社黨秉政的初年，一切對外貿易早加嚴格統制。德國貨幣在世界市塲上的自由交易，早加禁止。美國出口商，可以獲得德國的付款，但必須保存於德國內。出口商可用德國那筆款項，購買德貨輸至美國銷售，獲得美金。</p>
<p>但馬克的匯價也不統一，視交易的性質而定。舉例來說，馬克官　規定值美金四角，售出美金四十元的貨物，美商的得一百馬克。但在有些爲政府所願錢就的交易中，每馬克只值美金兩角，所以售出　金四十元的貨物，可獲二百馬克</p>
<p>雖　如此，德國海外接濟問題，在好多經濟學家及軍事專家視之，仍爲希特勒最弱的一環。煤的接濟固是充分了。鐵的供給可從　森堡及瑞典獲得大量的接濟。食糧的供給，也因丹麥荷蘭已在其侵佔之下，可不成問題。所最成問題者，厥為煤油一項。據國際煤油專家的意見，即使德國獲得　馬尼亞全部油產，羅馬尼亞每年煤油產量，加上德國自己的小量出產，及自蘇聯獲得一小部份，其總數也不過及美國二十天所出產的數量而已。</p>
<p>因此，大多數專家一致承認，就經濟財政兩方面而論，德國龐大的戰時機構，與發狂的舉動很難克服可操勝算的困難。除開接濟問題以外，若干專家　承認德國尚有人民究能忍受國家所强迫其忍受的犧牲至如何久的一個問題呢。</p>

<h3>法租界華軍集中營　昨發生嚴重慘劇　與越兵衝突致死傷多人　孤軍營糾紛仍在磋商中</h3>

<p>法租界內南市孤軍</p>
<p>民國二十六年十一月，華軍由上海西撤時、其南市方面不及退走之軍警、卽由法租界繳械收容、分別假用拉都路·霞飛路·薩坡賽路各學校地址、予以幽禁後、經陸續保釋、所有保安隊、別動隊等分子、均已悉數保出、所遺計九百六十人左右、均係陸軍第五十五師一六五旅三二八團至三三零團之兵士、其拘禁　所、亦集中於拉都路三八八弄十六號一處、該處原係位育小學舊址、經佔用後、該校遂遷至辣斐德路比德小學舊址授課</p>
<p>伙食問題引起衝突</p>
<p>每月由中國政府津貼法和界當局二萬四千元、俾供兵士伙食之需、小時有病、即送廣慈醫院之老監體院醫治、每星期得醫治三决、法租界對於該營監視、極爲嚴密、以往殊少發生事端、昨日晨十時許、該營兵十因小菜問題、與守軍發生衝突、遂至互鬥</p>
<p>開槍彈壓致有死傷</p>
<p>法捕房聞訊、派出卡車八輛、載越兵約三十人前往彈壓、越軍放射機關槍、據平明社探悉、孤軍方面死者七人，傷者二十餘人、同時外間馬路交通亦斷絕達三小時之久、並將該營總代表張廣志帶入捕房、又據另息、謂此一糾紛、係因昨日中秋令節、兵士　求老酒月餅而起、與法主任因言語不合、遂致衝突、法越兵士並開槍彈壓、結果孤軍死者五人、輕重傷十八人、</p>
<p>法租界之公表消息</p>
<p>又法租界捕房方面昨公表消息云、昨午十二時三十分許、拉都路華軍拘留營內、突有大部份孤軍企圖潛逃、會擬衝破法防軍及巡捕之保衛錢、當時雖經守衛者竭力勸阻、但未獲效果、故最後守衛者迫不得巳、使用武器、將羣衆逐退、聞有數名略遭微傷、</p>
<p>西報所紀肇事經過</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、公共租界孤軍營之不安情緒、今日（十六日）傳佈至法租界拉都路華兵拘留營、蓋駐守拉都路營之法越兵、忽遭營內華兵襲擊、竟開步槍鎭壓也、事後、受傷華兵若干、立卽在營中醫治、</p>
<p>鐵網竹竿用作武器</p>
<p>查拉都路營內華兵、係二十六年退入法租界之南市守軍、今日忽以　有刺鐵絲網之竹竿等爲武器、襲擊守營軍捕、法軍亟向空開槍示警無效、竟向華兵射擊、以謀自衛、</p>
<p>當局調查肇事原因</p>
<p>法官方人七頃告記者稱、「彼等不解華兵何故突施襲擊、蓋事前華兵未有怨言、其食物亦頗充足也」、負傷華兵、究有若干、今日未經披露、惟衆信內有受重傷者、出事後、守營法兵巳將秩序恢復、現情况如常、當局正調查肇事起因中、</p>
<p>孤軍營之糾紛事件</p>
<p>又據英文大美晚報消息、聞膠州路孤軍營中、擾攘三日、工部局與萬國商團代表數人、今晨往該營與孤軍首領謝團長磋商解決辦法、孤軍方面提出立卽釋放之强硬要求、截至今午爲止、尙未獲得解決、衆信今日午後、雙方將繼續磋商、孤軍士兵巳悉刻正進行磋商、然仍憤憤不平、</p>
<p>局方將作妥慎處置</p>
<p>今晨工部局對磋商事、無所發表、惟衆信今日磋商之後、工部局將對孤軍之前途、決定辦法、提交星期三日董事會議、加以討論、按孤軍營事件、係上星期五日工部局工務處苦力往修足球塲門而起、旋商定准許苦力前往修理、然决日孤軍士兵仍加反對、與守營白俄商團發生衝突、商團司令項培上校聞訊、親自赴營、謀取解決、傳孤軍對項培。亦曾動武、致擾攘迄今、尙未解決、</p>
<p>營房四周設探照燈</p>
<p>孤軍營四週之戒備措置、昨日竟益趣嚴重、與孤軍營毘隣之膠州公園中、咋亦有白俄團丁三名駐守、孤軍營周圍之雷桿木頂端、咋日下午並見有工匠正在裝設一千支光度之探照燈七具、昨日孤軍營與外間通路、仍受封鎖、致一切物品及來客、仍無法入內、電話依舊繼絕、全體孤軍、昨仍以白米裹腹、孤軍士兵、不時露首墻上、顯露其憤懣情緒、自十三日孤軍兵士與白俄隊隊員發生衝突後、該營迄今仍在萬國商團與警務處巡捕嚴密戒備中、孤軍兵士數名及少數禺國商團團員、因受萬國商團所擲催淚彈之影響、至今仍未復原、</p>

<h3>經濟叢談</h3>
<p>— 馮柳堂</p>
<p>籌算，籌馬，與珠算</p>
<p>中國計算所用之數字，通常有三種：（一）即一、二、三、四、五、六、七、八、九、十，此為數字之本體。（二）即壹、貳、叁、肆、伍、陸、柒、捌、玖、拾。俗稱大寫之數字，多半為借用之字體。（三）為工商界記　所用之“碼子”，（見後）現有呼之為“商碼”是也。</p>
<p>第一種所以借用為數字（除壹貳叁原亦為數字），正為其筆劃較繁，不易塗改，故　時官文書，（今亦然）以及今之支票填寫金額俱用之。然通常記帳，仍用數字之本體，或用碼子，取其書寫便捷也。</p>
<p>碼子之由來已久，而不知何自而來。在前人但知其然，而不求其所以然；且以為此工商末技，有何研究搜討之必要，即明知其然，而亦不願形之於筆，遂使今人數典忘祖，慾知其然，並知其所以然，有不可得矣。記者於數年前受友人之托，曾擬寫此文，懶於執筆。今見本報投稿為阿拉伯數字來源，有涉及碼子者，因思一抒所見，為研究碼子作開路之先鋒也可。</p>
<p>碼子，應作馬子（碼頭之碼亦為馬，非為碼，碼為碼碯之碼，）馬子之來源為籌馬，籌馬之制見於投壺。籌，壺矢也；馬者，投壺勝者為之立馬以記數，禮記投壺有云：“正爵既行，請為勝者立馬，一馬從二馬，三馬既立，請　多馬。”</p>
<p>孔穎達曰：“立馬，謂取算以為馬，表勝數也，每一勝輒立一馬，禮以三位成，三馬既立，請　多馬者，其勝已成。”又云：</p>
<p>“算，長尺二寸。”</p>
<p>此　其長度。但“算”與“馬，”實即“體”與“用，”故有曰：</p>
<p>“馬各直其算。”</p>
<p>投壺</p>
<p>馬係象形，以投壺於遊戲之中，寓尚武之意，故用以計算勝者曰馬。</p>
<p>筭與算在造字時原有分別，說文竹部筭云：</p>
<p>“筭，長六寸，計秝數者，從竹從弄，　常弄乃不誤也。”</p>
<p>說文係東漢時人作，當時之筭長六寸，合今尺猶在四寸左右，後世則一寸有零。惟釋義，算須常弄乃不誤，故筭　弄，深得學算精意。即今之習算者，亦何嘗不須常演習而始有成，足見中國造字能將如何可以習算成功之意義寓於其中也。又曰：</p>
<p>“算，數也；從竹具，讀　筭。”</p>
<p>段氏注曰：“筭為算之器，算為筭之用，二字音同而義別。”又曰：“算謂筭　，與算數字各用，計之，所謂算也。”　一為名詞，一為動詞也。　占算字中最可看出籌算之形式者，莫如</p>
<p>“　”</p>
<p>此其字形，足見筭籌之縱橫排列狀，宛然一布筭之雛形也。</p>
<p>以　籌，說文有云：</p>
<p>“籌，壺矢也。從竹　聲徐　曰，投壺之矢也，其制似箸，人以之算數也。”</p>
<p>，本為投壺所用之矢之稱，因以投中之　多寡立馬計輸贏，　之用亦無異於馬矣。於是“籌”與“馬”相聯繫，而成“籌馬”之一名詞，為後世計算數字之統稱。今籌算之制雖廢，而用籌以計數之　迄今猶復盛行，如棧房出進貨物仍用竹　　計數。故勞玉初論籌算曰。“　者，其正名也；籌者其通稱也；　者，用以計之之讀也。其材以竹，其形似箸，其色有赤有黑，（正算赤，負算黑，）其　不一，古長而今短，　古者　地　坐，布筭於地，故宜長；後世　於几案，故宜短。　明於此，　　子房　　　　　之　有由來矣。漢初　猶未脫席地而坐之習，（如漢文帝不覺席之　也，足見當時　用　，）然　與籌，其形已相近，故“借箸”可以“代籌，”後人　用其詞，而不明箸之所以代　之故也。</p>
<p>籌算之來　既明，一究籌算之形式，　籌馬之由來亦有因矣。籌算　　，其一二三四．．．．．．數字之排列，有縱列橫列兩式，（見圖），布算之時，縱橫互見，以免混淆。所可異者，籌算與筆算，雖古今中西之不相　，而數字自左首列序而下則一。籌算之　　位（如兩數字中間之　與單位之　）用錢，筆錄之時則用　，與筆算相同；籌算之布式，雖有與筆算相異處，而法實等之位置則相同。時無論古今，地無論東西，人類所具之意識，出自天賦，故其所制作亦大同而小異也。</p>
<p>籌算失傳，不知始於何時，余嘗檢閱唐宋元明諸史，而不易得其跡象。大抵唐時猶盛行籌算，可於唐書創作大衍曆之一行和尚傳中見之：</p>
<p>“一行求訪師資，以窮大衍，至天台山　清寺，見一院古松十數，門有流水。一行立於門屏間，聞院僧於庭布筭聲，而謂其徒曰：“今日當有弟子自遠求吾筭法，已合到門，豈無人導達也。”即除一筭，又謂曰：“門前水當却西流，弟子亦至，”一行承其言而趨入，稽首請法，盡受其術焉，而門前水果却西流。”</p>
<p>此後律曆雖有改變，而籌算之見於著作者，僅有明史藝文志羅雅谷籌算一卷，至清康熙間梅殼成有古算器考，足徵籌算已失傳矣。</p>
<p>筆算何自入中國，亦不可得考，但至　當　元代；元世祖至西元四年有回人札馬魯丁用其本國曆法，進萬年曆，以三百六十五日為一年，不置閏月，而置閏日。明洪武初，特為回回曆置官設職以掌其事，旋又　置。乃其後曆失其序，日月食時間常不符，甚至塑日之夜見微月，會利馬寶來中國，挟西洋天算以俱來，與上海徐光啟等習，徐乃以西洋天算之說進，與龐迪峨，熊三拔等（俱西洋天主教士）同修曆。其後天主教士來中國者尚有鄧玉　，龍華民，羅雅谷，湯若望等，俱與中國天算史上有相當之　　。湯全清康熙年間，尚為講曆而遭　，卒以所推算準確，南懷仁（亦西洋教士）起而為之昭雪，南且為康熙製造大砲以平三藩也。（按徐光啟亦主張與教士等共造大砲，以抗清師，為兵部所格而罷，庸臣誤國，但知有私，不知有公，類如此。）自筆算入中國，而中國之算術為之大變，籌算式微，亦其一大原因也。</p>
<p>因用籌算只故，記錄其計算之結果，狀其形，而成為今日流行之籌馬。此觀於附圖即可明瞭籌馬者，即籌算計數之符號也。惟有　、　、文、三馬子，與籌算之形不符，此則尚有待於考證者也。</p>
<p>係兩籌交　之狀也，求其字跡，則為古“五”字，自與　無涉。　則為“五”字之一筆寫成，（見附圖）故非從籌算得來。蓋　與　若照籌算排列，非為四畫五畫，即為四豎五豎，豎畫之數太繁，不便於筆錄，故求其簡，則做　與　，亦其宜也。至“九”之作“文”，此又脫胎於籌算，而變其形式；蓋籌算之上一豎為五，故九作文，上為五，下為四，合之　得其九也。</p>
<p>馬子既從籌算脫胎而來，故舊時呼之曰籌馬，最為允當，呼之曰商馬，要知使用此籌碼者，固不限於商界也，　有未切。</p>
<p>珠算之制，不過利用籌算之理，製作為算器而已。蓋珠算除“五”在橫檔之上，與籌算橫列之形式稍異外，（其實仍是一致，珠算至四加一時，始為一下五去四，而五在上檔，若不下五去四，則仍與籌算之狀無異也。）其餘均為　算橫列之狀。（見附圖）　夫珠算始於何時，余嘗求之於史而不可見。（余讀史無多，或有之而未及發見耳！不知梅氏叢書有此記載否，惜未見其書也。）但籌算自元明以來，似漸失其傳，必當時有起而代之者之故，否則計算之具，日用所不可缺，焉有失傳之理，殆疑當時已有珠盤之作矣。且珠算之口訣，原從籌算而來。而口訣之由來已久，宋洪容齊續筆中，已記有三四十二，三六十八．．．．．．等計算上之俗語，謂淮南子及杜預注左轉有八八六十四之句，（原文不克記憶，僅記其大意）可見漢晉之間已流行，則目今所習用之九九乘法表，出於古代之籌算更多一證矣。</p>
<p>從籌算一變而為珠算，為中國計算工具之一進步；蓋用　布算，不若圓柱圓珠計數之進退自如也。每柱固定其珠數，上檔之一珠代五，下檔每珠為一，固與籌算無異，然運算除有時上檔兩珠同時使用外，餘時上　珠下五珠　夠應用，不若籌算之籌，易於　　，而定位無珠盤之得固定也。珠算運用靈活，非籌算　籌可比，故易為人樂用，而籌算遂無人顧及矣。</p>
<p>加減乘除，珠算較筆算為捷；勞玉初籌算考釋，並　開方亦以籌算比筆算為快，余固未之試。但以為除目前新　明之計算器外，珠算固為計算工具之最便捷者，雖有錯誤不易發見之憾，但為“不常弄”之過，常弄者常不誤，此觀於錢業中幾位算盤名宿，運珠如飛，筆算縱快，有望　莫及之嘆可知也。即新式計算器亦有時無其快捷，惜乎年來之習珠算者故漸普遍，而運算佳妙者則少見。</p>
<p>中國籌馬之從籌算脫胎而來，當不至大　不然，惟阿拉伯數字是否從中國籌馬遷變而成，抑由印度傳入，在未有研究前，未敢妄　　　，姑存其說，以待日後之考證。按回教之通中國，在唐太宗時，（按穆罕默德克麥加，稱霸於阿拉伯，為唐貞觀四年庚寅，）至肅宗乾元元年，以寧國公主嫁回紇可汗；代宗永泰元年回紇吐蕃入寇，郭子儀免胄見回紇，受盟而還。中國與回教國通，以此一百五十年間為最。若籌碼由此時中傳入回紇，亦非將阿拉伯史乘作深切之研究，不易下一斷語。至於由印度傳入，更非從印阿兩國史實中另覓線索不可。惟余有疑者，則為羅馬數字之形式編制，竟與中國籌馬若相符契。　　一二三四，固與籌算中　縱列式無二數；自五至九，形式雖異，而其理復相同。中國與羅馬為東四大古國，數字　相若，其意義如何，　有研究之餘地，惜余不學，未能　所疑也。</p>
<p>經濟叢談不常發表，非無稿，為無地位；非　為無地位，亦為有地位應供讀者用，故經濟叢談非有其必要，不在本報發表。將來　　在　　“柳堂隨筆”中刊行，以求　於當世，惟不知　　何日耳。　編者</p>
<h3>再談阿剌伯數字</h3>
<p>— 深嚴</p>
<p>八月二十八日，在商業新聞中，有須　問先生作的一篇關於“阿剌伯數字”，甚感興趣。考須先生的結論，以為阿剌伯數字，斷乎脫胎於中國商碼。不過就我所知道，現在所謂“阿剌伯數字”，實在不是阿剌伯人所發明的，而是從印度學來的。因為古時印度的天文學，是非常的發達，於是算學乃因需要而發展起來。阿剌伯之向印度學習算學，我們在韋爾斯著的世界史網里可看出，韋爾斯說：“……此外阿剌伯人所受之激動，更有第三　源焉，即印度也，算學尤特受其賜……”如此阿剌伯向印度學習，是可以證明了。</p>
<p>但是印度到底如何發明此等數字，這倒有兩種說法；不過究竟是否真實　　，筆者還待諸讀者加以討論。</p>
<p>第一種說法，以為印度這種數字是由　　所蛻化出來的，頂簡單的是以一劃代表“一”，二劃代表“二”，這在我國　　數字（不是商碼）亦是如此。筆者以為此種說法最准確而最可靠：（見圖下）</p>
<p>第二種說法，以為印度的數字是由角度所蛻化出來的。因為古代的民族，對於角度的觀念很早就有了。距今四五千年前的巴比倫人，已經發明角度六十　　的。而且角度對於天文學是有很大用處，印度是天文學先進國家，當然對於角度的觀念，也是很早具備的了。不過筆者以為這種說法不及第一種可靠，因為角度的發明，一定不比直　來得早，而且也比　　來得奧妙且難。（見圖上）</p>
<p>最後至於中國商碼，筆者以為也在唐朝由玄奘從印度取經後，所傳入中國的　？</p>
<h3>金融　英美匯兌　一年來之變遷</h3>
<p>英美滙兌行市、在此次歐戰以前，恒在四元八角六分平價左右、及至去年八月二十五日、因歐戰將作、資金逃避、放棄維持後、八月二十八日英鎊低落、至美金四元一角、九月間英國實施外滙統制、倫敦市　祗有四元〇二分半之官定滙率、至於紐約英鎊、仍可自由交易、至本年三月五日英國政府宣佈加強滙兌管理、英鎊對美滙率降至三元七角、四月九日德軍進攻挪威時、跌至三元四角、至德軍入荷蘭比利時再跌、一度曾落至三元一角五分、六日英政府宣佈凡非英國住民所有之證券、不能再在英鎊集團以內之市　出售、紐約自由英鎊價格、即見回漲、近均在四元左右、上週六為四元〇三分七五、但依上週六上海英滙與美滙行市折合、則每一英鎊祗合美金三元五角三分、即按週六英滙收盤價三辨士·六（）九三七五、售英金一鎊、收入國幣六十六元四角九分、同時美滙收盤價為五元三一二五、以英金一鎊之價、買美金、祗合三元五角三分美金、若與紐約美英匯兌行市比較、每鎊相差美金達五角餘、</p>

<h3>各銀行鈔票真偽之鑒別</h3>
<p>— 沈鋆</p>
<p>上海流通之鈔票，除中央·中國·交通·中國農民四行法幣外，尚有中國農工·中南·四明（該三行鈔票歸中央銀行代理）中國通商·農商·（該二行鈔票歸中國銀行代理）浙江興業·中國實業·中國墾業·（該三行鈔票歸交通代理）等八行。另有浙江地方銀行，該行鈔票（杭州地名）大部收回，市上已不多見。</p>
<p>鈔票數位，計分百元·五十元·十元·五元·一元五種，每種同一數位，又因發行年份版本不同，式樣顏色亦互異。又有他省地名鈔票（俗稱外埠劵）有可通用者，有不可通用者，（近年發行之法幣，已無地名，全國一律通用，）并有將接收行券改為法幣者，如中國農工之改中央一元券，中國實業之改交通一元券，湖北省銀行之改中國農民五元十元券，以上種種不過舉其大略，已是種類繁多，令人目迷五色。</p>
<p>雖然，鑒別鈔票，是基於吾人應具之記憶，與熟練之本能，如過能有良好方法，以便於查閱，豈不可節省吾人時間腦力，與避免意外之損失乎！至本報編者先生，前次按語云，不少鈔票在未有水印之前，附有暗號，但不肯示人，恐作偽者仿造，并謂造偽鈔者於鈔票上故露破綻，以為將來破獲時減輕罪刑，但照鄙人管見，鈔票未有水印前，另有暗記，原為鑒別起見，不明白公佈，亦屬事實，然亦未將暗記形狀公諸銀錢業。至於不公佈暗記，恐作偽者仿造，則並非如此，蓋作偽者製造假鈔，大概均以真鈔拍照，以作藍本，再製銅版印刷，故偽鈔花紋，均粗劣模糊，真鈔暗記至為細小，常非目力所能及，偽鈔花紋模糊，此種精細暗記，自然不能印出，所謂故露破綻，使人易於鑒別，不過是印刷技術上達不到的緣故，蓋作偽者製造偽鈔，最好求其逼真，使收受者不相察覺，試將真鈔與偽鈔摺疊對照，其週圍花紋線路與數字形狀均相吻合，於此可見此係技術上問題，非避罪問題也，先生以為然否！</p>
<p>編者按：關於造偽鈔不求逼真，以圖減輕罪刑之說，約略記得前清某銀行鈔票發現偽造，及破案，偽造者提出反證，以為　票雙龍不點睛作辯。惟以年代過久，　案有不克記清矣。至由真鈔翻印，編者亦有所聞也。</p>
<p>茲先將中央銀行之鈔票種類，鑒別偽券之特點，改票之種種，　列一表，以供各界參考。</p>

<h3>人生的二個教訓（一）</h3>
<p>讀者諸君：我們在過去一個月的時間，已經將耶穌基督的犧牲，勇敢及饒恕精神，介紹給各位了，雖然還可以繼續地再說關於耶穌其他的美德，但爲了　使各位讀者在思想　方面略有　　　見，讓我們來研究研究人生。財物」，一個是說「耶和華用厚恩待我」，換句話說，一　的快樂根據是物質上的豐富；兩個人的生活，可以得着關於人生的三個教訓：（一）看這二人的生活，可知甚麽是真實，甚麼是虛幻？普通人總以為目能見的，手能的為真實，否則就視為虛幻，因此在物質上爭競富有，多了還想多，有了還過有，多多益善，貪得無厭，將精神完全貫注在物質上面，甚至將上帝　出思想之外，自己的靈魂也置之腦後，這是何等危險，何等痛心的事啊！</p>
<p>耶穌說：『人的生命不在乎家道豐富』（路加十二15）換句話說，家道豐富的人，他的生命未必豐富。許多人因為有了錢財反為財富所累，不能安逸度日。也有許多人一生勞碌關上項，省喫儉用，到老身體衰弱，雖有錢不能得著健康。若不幸遇到天災人禍，富有者立即可以成為貧窮。我們若能看透這一切，辨明真實與虛幻，實其所常實，就是一個真有智慧的人了。（二十日再登）</p>
<p>讀者欲知詳細，請函　詞上海愛文義路三五一號文字布道社，當有詳細答覆。</p>
<p>婦女</p>
<h3>妻的犧牲</h3>
<p>— 嚴止</p>
<p>「……姊姊並非庸碌之士，相反地你比我要强上幾倍。奈何現在你埋在家庭的瑣事中了！我並不反對你的居家，但我以爲你是可以不使自己成爲一個席俗的人的。那不是說一定要轟轟烈烈地幹。撫養未來的主人翁，强化他們的敎育，不是目前迫切的工作嗎？不要看輕小東西，他們是我們的後備軍呀！……</p>
<p>讀着從遙遠的陝北遞來的她的大妹的信，妻笑笑不說什麼。我却又一次感到慚愧得無地自容。</p>
<p>妻是上海一個有名的女子中學師範科畢業的。在校時，因爲品學兼優，師友們許爲最有前途的一個。在我剛邂逅她的日干裏，她巳在一個公司裏做事了。當時我們的理想非常美滿。我們打算在婚後一同早出晚歸，各人盡各人對國家，社會的責任。不料在我們的婚期前不久，她服務着的那個公司關了門，她失業了。接着我們結了婚，還有了孩子……</p>
<p>妻開始埋在家庭的瑣事中了，允其是在我們脫離了我的一老家之後。美滿的理想到底變成泡影了！過去好像一個夢。妻不得小拋棄書木，拋棄自己的理想，輾轉在菜塲上，廚房裏，臥室中。她變爲一個出色的管家婦了。這個犧牲是相當巨大的，想到它我常感到慚愧得無地自容！</p>
<p>接着她的大妹獨自往陝北去了。她的二妹也做了敎員。這兩件事予妻以怎樣的影響和打擊，我是理會的。但是妻的性格挺頑强，她不大喜歡回憶過去，相反地，她却抓住現在，熱心地敎育起孩子們來。她的注意力完全集中三個孩子，彷彿把她的希望寄托在他們的身上了。她要將她所知道的統統傳授給他們。這樣，我們的才四足　的大孩子得以考入。</p>
<p>戰爭</p>
<h3>戰爭與氣候</h3>
<p>— 史弢</p>
<p>人類的物質文明是如此發達了，而人類的戰爭也似乎日趨頻繁，最近一般天文學者都在熱心研究戰爭與氣象的關係，他們認爲太陽的黑點與戰爭有極大的關係，太陽上的黑點一多，人類因爲受了紫外綫幅射的刺激，日益興奮，以至爆發戰爭，不過他們的論據至今尙未到成熟的地步；太陽黑點的多少與戰爭的產生究有幾許影饗，我們暫置勿論，至少氣候與作戰是有極大關係的：人類和用嚴寒，暴雨，濃霧，……等等氣候的變異而作特別的戰略，是數見不鮮了，三國演義上的孔明借箭正是一個絕好的例子。</p>
<p>在承平時代，氣象事業是帶有國際性的，爲了要製作正個管敎很認眞的小學，第個孩子在家裏哼着她的哥哥讀爛了的三册幼稚園讀本，我們的十個月的阿三會拿小手打哇哇，看見了陌生人儘嘻喀笑！</p>
<p>此外，有一點值得特書的：妻對孩子們的愛是潛在的。她敎育孩子們，好像一個公園園丁愛護他手植的花木，同時他懂待那些花木是屬於公衆的</p>
<p>讀着從遙遠的陝北遞來的她的大妹的信，妻笑笑，不說什麼。我却又一决感到慚愧得無地自容。</p>
<p>像妻一樣作了犧牲的，又不知有多少哩！</p>
<p>準的天氣預報，那就必得與隣近諸國交換氣象的　報，可是到了鐵烏縱橫的今日戰時，各交戰國都將氣象情報秘匿不宣，因爲假使給對方明曉了這里的氣候，則遭受敵機轟炸等的危機更爲重大了。根據美國的書報，最近歐洲各交戰國都實施氣象管制，並且也極力在蒐集敵方的氣象情報。</p>
<p>氣象情報的穩秘不宣，防止敵機活躍當然是一個重大的理由，上决歐戰爆發後，英法方面有一很長時期不實施氣象管制，以致倫敦遭德機空襲了無數决，英國受了過去的敎訓，自然此决不再重蹈覆輙了</p>
<p>在這决大戰中，毒瓦斯等好像還不會被利用過，當然，放射毒瓦斯和撒布細菌，在戰時國際公法中是被禁止的，但縱使不禁止，毒瓦期等在戰爭中也有很難利用之處。因爲要使瓦斯戰衛有效，必須具備…個條件：（一）要有大量的瓦期材料，（二）風力　弱，風向敵方，且必須有氣溫逆轉層之存在；瓦斯材料的補充如今是非常困難，積集瓦斯也非經相當時日不可，因此不可能應急需的要求；至于第二個條件，更值得注目，毒瓦斯在一旦放射之後，經過相當時間，就會散逸，而　牠的密度漸减，終于失却效力；在一·五米左右的風速中，毒瓦斯最爲適宜，爲使放射出來的毒瓦斯長久停滯地上，那末地上至少非有兩米高的氣溫逆轉層不可。但是此稱氣溫的逆轉祇有在晴天的淸晨才有，風向向敵富然是必須的條件，但在風速每秒一。五半時，一般的風向是沒有一定的，一會南風，頃刻父變北風，而且受了地形的影　，風向也易發生急遽的變化，所以，撒　毒瓦斯和其時期是受着諸多限制的。</p>
<h3>隨筆　故鄉的眷戀</h3>
<p>— 品品</p>
<p>我一直眷戀着故鄉。父親說：我們的故鄉在海的後面山的前面。這是一個多麼美麗的地方，卽使現在想來。海一定會嘯，山一定會在夕陽下閃出五色；一個音樂與畫　的世界，不大能够用文字來描述的。</p>
<p>故鄉更是一個芳香的世界，因爲牠在南中幽，有果樹奇葩的香，有海味珍產的香。在過去，或父親回鄉，或鄉人來滬，總帶來許多可吃的香東西，如六角形的洋桃，生得疙瘩的波羅，扁扁的允魚乾，圓圓的番芋頭……我像餓鬼一樣狼呑着。小時候大家叫我「饞虫」，但是在這芳香的東西前誰不饞呢?年紀一大，不饞了，但東西也少有放進嘴裹——父親經常地失業，買不起了。</p>
<p>而現在什麼都沒有了。不單洋桃與波羅沒有，甚至海與山也沒有了。海上山上罩滿了昏暗的黑影。音樂變成悲號，圖盡變成鮮血，芳香變成屍臭；這巳是一堆破碎物。</p>
<p>故鄉啊，我是多麼眷戀着你呀！</p>
<p>從誕生到今天，我始終沒有去拜訪過故鄉，因爲沒有湊巧的機會。我埋在都市的窟裹太久，我只有憤怒對道都市。我夢故鄉，想故鄉，今天呢？</p>
<p>因此我加倍地眷戀着故鄉</p>
<p>故鄉是破碎了，給誰?我知道得淸楚。我不怨，我相信故鄉只是暫時的破碎，在快來的一天，必把毀滅者毀滅，個新的世界在破碎裹出現。暫時的破碎是要的，因爲預備新生。——那末，怒吼吧，海與山！那麼，舉起吧，鐵一樣的拳頭！在別人的許多故鄉得到解放的曙光前，我的也在光明裏了。</p>
<p>我將要到故鄉去，帶一尊酒痛欽黃龍。</p>
<h3>老了嗎？</h3>
<p>— 蒲明</p>
<p>有許多成功的事業家，年紀雖高，還有着年靑的心，什麼都感到新鮮，不停地克服一切的困難，將生命之途看得遙遠，廣闊。</p>
<p>「老了！」道是生命的喪鐘。一個人的心志，永遠不會老的，奮鬥的力量，沒有盡蜴的時候。</p>
<p>尼采說：「你們不要愛祖先的國，應該愛你們子孫的國。」我們對于人生，不要愛過去的時光，應該愛求來的日子。無論做了多大的事業，不值得跨躍，還當苦幹着，沒有喊老而停止的時候。</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第七章　「把他押起来」</p>
<p>「吃完夜飯，就到電影院去。從電影散出來後，又怎麼樣呢?」</p>
<p>「我就送伊回去。」</p>
<p>「你陪伊一塊兒進去的嗎?」</p>
<p>「沒有，我不曾進去。我的汽車在門口停住，讓伊一個人下車。因爲雨下得很大，我自己不會下車。」</p>
<p>電影是在十一點半完的。我送伊到家裹，最多在十一點三刻光景。」</p>
<p>「你在門口可會瞧見什麼人？」</p>
<p>「沒有——霍先生，你問那個趙伯雄嗎?」</p>
<p>霍桑並不回答，仍自顧自地發問：「那時你可會瞧見伊樓下的會客室中有沒有燈光?」</p>
<p>陸建笙沉着目光，好像在追想什麼的樣子。接着，他搖搖頭說：「我不曾留意，因爲我不會下車。」</p>
<p>「你的確不曾下車嗎?我想你還是說實話的好。」</p>
<p>「那當然是實話，我實在不會下車。」</p>
<p>「我就回家裏去——」</p>
<p>霍桑突然剪住他說：「回家裹去？這也是實話嗎？」</p>
<p>陸健笙的身子怔了一怔，臉上浮出種掩飾不住的驚愕。他忙着糾正說：「唉！不，我到揚子旅社去的。」</p>
<p>霍桑冷笑了一聲。陸先生，你太健忘了，才隔了幾個鐘頭的事，你就會記不得。」</p>
<p>那大腹　緊蹙着雙眉，低沉了目光，那隻右手的大拇指和食指，儘在搓旋那枚沒火的雪茄。這副窘態，眞是可笑又很可憐。</p>
<p>他掙扎地說：「霍先生，你別認眞，這是我組心失言。我是到揚子旅社去打麻雀的，直到天亮方才回家。我到了家裹才知道王麗蘭被打死的消息。」（一〇九）</p>

<p>㳺藝界</p>
<h3>一片祝壽聲中　談談王瑤卿之門牆桃李</h3>
<p>— 病鳩</p>
<p>老伶工王瑤卿，自客歲伴同其女弟子王玉蓉南下後，滬人對之印象彌佳。今歲廢曆八月上浣適值六旬壽辰，故都劇界，演戲稱觴，盛况空前，一片祝壽聲裏，忙煞門弟子大費周章，平滬報章，競記其事，亦梨園佳話也。</p>
<p>瑤卿爲鳳卿之兄，乃陳德霖最先出道之弟子，負盛譽於光緒末葉，譚鑫培當時演劇，靑衫一角，均以瑤卿爲配，銖輛悉稱，名重一時，口碑之佳，迄今弗袞。彼於靑衣　門旦刀馬旦各戲，靡不工絕，倒嗓以後，致力於白口戲，念字吐音，斬釘截鐵，淸脆老辣，不可方物，旗裝戲更爲擅長。蓋彼內庭供奉時，對於貝子貝勒之福晋動態，耳濡目染，一旦搬演，妙入毫巓。善創新腔，精研字音，服裝方面，如十三妹之蠻靴，雙陽公主之靠旗，胥爲彼所新創，平生貢獻於劇壇殊多，功續不在老譚之下，債茲懸弧良辰，理宜有所表示也。</p>
<p>瑤卿退休以後，課徒爲活，而慕名拜其門下者，不下數十人，茲就所記憶者，錄之於後，掛名而未得實學者不列焉。</p>
<p>男伶　榮蝶仙　梅蘭芳</p>
<p>王蕙芳　尙小雲　羅小寶</p>
<p>（未改鬚生前唱靑衣）筱</p>
<p>翠花　姜妙香　芙蓉草</p>
<p>王芸芳　苟慧生　程艷秋</p>
<p>程玉菁　李香勻　馬艷冰</p>
<p>黃玉麟　戴衍芳　李緝之</p>
<p>郭效靑　果湘林　吳蘭芳</p>
<p>王盛意　孫盛芳　南鐵生</p>
<p>章曉珊（票友）等。</p>
<p>女伶　雪艷琴　新艷秋</p>
<p>杜麗雲　華慧麟　章遏雲</p>
<p>毛劍佩（巳故）　鄒劍佩</p>
<p>李吟香　金素琴　李艷春</p>
<p>王玉蓉以及最近所收之綠</p>
<p>染香張雲燕（卽北上之秋</p>
<p>雲艷）等。</p>
<p>瑤卿之門弟子中，自以四大名旦爲最得意，惟就實際工力言，程玉菁可稱具體而微，梅程雖得瑤卿指示，未盡師宗，各就共個性之所適，博採衆長，兼收並蓄，得造成今日之地位。其由自身努力者固值得讚美，要亦瑤卿提携之功不可歿。慧生桐珊之京白，學王最有功夫，票界中南鐵生（現已下海）學得表面，章曉珊巳入堂奧，造詣不輸內行，坤伶中雪艷琴新艷秋曾經親炙，俱有所得，章遏雲就學王門最久，學力遠過常伶，可謂坤旦第一人，華慧麟天賦不足，王玉蓉僅以唱勝，皆非佳才，自膾以下，更無論矣。</p>
<h3>某製片家談　電影界「差不多」傾向</h3>
<p>— 海星</p>
<p>于宴席上遇某影業巨頭，談及國片之製作路綫，某巨頭暢談其個人所見，或可作爲今日製片家之珍貴參考，彼云：『昔時文藝界有「差不多」傾向，今日電影界亦彷彿似之，各公司旣羣走古裝片之路，而其性質不外兩種，一爲公子小姐談情作品，民開影片十九如此，另一種寫歷代之悲壯史實者，題材固佳，而佈局以及人物，類多大同小異，有人謂爲「銀色八股」似非過甚其詞，我以爲不論古裝時裝，都可攝製，形色不妨隨便，而劇旨不能不向新的路上出發，所謂「新的，」並非標新立異，想入非非，蓋電影片欲不負本旨，不一定要寫忠臣殉國烈女殉雞，其他儘有大可發揮的好題材也，」「差不多」問題，在今日製片者實有檢討必要，否則愈走愈狹，在所難免耳。</p>
<h3>女皇帝李綺年之笑容</h3>
<p>— 星谷攝</p>
<h3>評「李香君」</h3>
<p>— 金戈</p>
<p>的確李香君是值得一看的一部作品。</p>
<p>從舞台搬上銀幕，由於原作者自己担任改編，劇情方面也無多大更動，因此話劇裏許多警惕的對白依舊能保持，而話劇裏爲着空間所限制不能演出的許多塲面，也能藉着電影的特有技術，更充分地發揮出來。</p>
<p>導演吳村是稱職的，他處理下男女主角的纏綿悱惻的情意，有着他特有的作風，細膩而生動，對於幾個戰亂鏡頭也頗具大刀闊斧的手法，祇是高潮的抓取還稍嫌小够。</p>
<p>鄒嘯先生說過作者寫劇對於劇中人物心理的描寫是極共滇密的，這點導演由理解的透澈而至自我創造也是極其成功的。如王將軍送賄路來的時侯朝宗猶豫不決的神情，暴露出他意志不堅定將來屈服的伏筆，又如酒肉氣的福王，在被迎接進京時偷偷　燕子箋劇本，也顯示出他是一個不間政治的庸才。香君撞窗昏去一節，這樣處理是失當的，雖不一定要去請醫，可讓貞　爲香君先行包紮或酒些藥沫上去，不然似乎太欠合理。攝影角度的安置，頗見用心，也增加了它在藝術上的成就。</p>
<p>顧蘭君是有着很好演出，最後擲瓶　侯嘔血慘死，表演得十分精彩，對於　言時眼部的表情有時還太覺機械，希望她能注意及之。白雲的侯朝宗大致可說盡職，祇是浮滑了些</p>
<p>劇本意義的深長，導演技巧的優秀，演員演技的深刻以及其他一切都不會使你失望，對於此片可說是金星的第一道光芒。</p>
<h3>崑曲詞句檢討</h3>
<p>— 弄笛樓主</p>
<p>自來票友戲劇諸家，皆言崑曲劇本，文采風流，遠勝皮簧；然而習之者却尠有趨向，　世亂方殷，人心剛毅，文化袞落，深奧莫解，蟲聲起而天下秋，雷嗚作而山雨來；然後知聲音之道，與世運不無有關。予嘗涉獵各傳奇，若鳴鳳荊釵白兎精忠諸本，皆重忠義，琵琶拜月，孝思深切，紅梨玉簪，儒雅風流，玉茗四夢，美詞藻，嚴格律，曼聲徐度，固可養志，不當以言情目也。偶選佳句以吿同嗜者，更願世之君子有以倡導焉。</p>
<p>（一）遊園（皂羅袍）「朝飛暮捲，雲霞翠軒，雨絲風片，烟波畫船，錦屛人　看得韶光賤。」試思杜麗娘進得園來，覩此良辰美景，胸中何等淸　！傷春忸怩，爲　女天賦之情，一種曼妙狀態，不期然流露盡矣。柳夢梅花邊入夢，兩相繾綣，「惹下蜂愁蝶戀三生有綠。」不必有其事，不可無此曲。</p>

<h3>Fierce Air Battle in London the Day Before Yesterday: British Air Force Achieves Major Victory; British Official Report Claims 185 German Planes Shot Down; German Planes Continuously Attacked Again Yesterday Without Success</h3>
<p>London - Yesterday's massive air battle was the greatest sacrifice made by the German Air Force in a month. Around 11 AM, approximately 350 to 400 German planes in two batches attacked London and the southeast of England. The first batch of 200 enemy bombers and fighters were divided into eight or ten groups, flying into the skies between Dover and Dungeness. At 1:15 PM, another ten groups of enemy planes, totaling 150 to 200, also flew over the coast. Smaller groups of enemy planes harassed the areas of Portland and Southampton in the evening, but British patrol fighters intercepted them each time. The two fierce battles over London were unprecedented. Spitfire and Hurricane British squadrons, mostly piloted by experienced aviators from London's air defense, flew out to intercept. The enemy planes turned back, and the British planes pursued relentlessly until the enemy planes flew over the English Channel. One squadron of Hurricane fighters destroyed nine enemy planes and then returned to London to search for more. Another British squadron shot down five enemy planes in pursuit. Some enemy planes that flew to the Thames Estuary were severely attacked by Hurricane British planes, with almost none surviving. Apart from five enemy planes crashing, the rest were also heavily damaged and fled in disarray. After the fourth air raid warning, enemy planes flew into the inner circle of London, but the barrage of artillery fire was deafening, and the enemy planes ascended and fled in the same direction, not daring to circle London. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>A Certain Port in Southeastern England - Yesterday, an extremely fierce air battle occurred over this area. At least a hundred German planes, forming a strong formation, fought with British destroyers. German planes appeared over this area five minutes after the air raid alarm was issued, and were immediately met with deafening anti-aircraft fire from the British side. Although many anti-aircraft shells pierced directly through the German groups, the German planes were undeterred and continued to soar. After a few minutes, a large number of British fighters ascended and pounced on the German planes, scattering their formation and engaging in a fierce battle in the clouds. German and British planes could be seen darting down from the clouds from time to time, or ascending again while strafing with machine guns. It was reported that three German planes immediately crashed to the ground. The British fighters fought extremely fiercely, without a moment's pause, preventing the German planes from having a chance to drop bombs. One German aviator deployed his parachute and landed near here, unharmed. The sound of the air battle subsided after a long time. (United Press, 16th)</p>
<p>London - This morning, German planes again scattered bombs capable of causing death and destruction over London. The tension increased until 1 AM (9 AM Shanghai summer time). A hospital in London, which had been built for many years, was directly hit by a bomb, and the extent of casualties and damage was difficult to ascertain immediately. A reporter from the United Press was hit by shrapnel from an anti-aircraft shell on Oxford Street, wounded, and fled. While fleeing, he still heard four bombs falling nearby, but none of them exploded, seemingly being time bombs. Early this morning, German planes also visited many towns in the northeast, southeast, southwest, and central regions. (United Press, 16th)</p>
<p>London - Today, London was again subjected to air raids, with three alarms sounded before noon. The first two lasted about half an hour each. The third was issued at 11:12 AM and lifted 39 minutes later. At 1:12 PM, a fourth air raid alarm was issued again. Most of the German planes were driven back near the coast, and no fighting occurred over the London area. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>London - Today, German long-range artillery positions along the French coast opened fire on Dover, injuring eleven people. The British side also returned fire. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Dublin - After a full night of bombing by German planes, the all-clear signal was not given in London until 5:36 AM this morning. The first air raid alarm was issued at 8:08 PM last night. The anti-aircraft fire was extremely intense throughout the night, causing all street traffic to come to a standstill, as shrapnel rained down, making it quite dangerous for pedestrians. Several places caught fire due to incendiary bombs. It is now believed that most of the bombs dropped at night were delayed-action types. Yesterday, the London area shot down three German bombers. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>London - According to an official announcement, a total of 185 German planes were destroyed yesterday. The actual number of British planes lost was 25, as five of the 30 previously reported missing had safely returned to their bases, with all twelve crew members safe and sound. After 8 PM last night, German planes continuously invaded, incessantly throughout the night. The dense anti-aircraft fire network forced the enemy planes to evade. Three hospitals were hit, but only one sustained minor casualties. Buckingham Palace was bombed three times last night, and the extent of the damage is still unknown. The Ministry of Aviation and the Ministry of Internal Security issued a public statement saying that small groups of enemy bombers attacked London in shifts last night, causing damage to residences, shops, and other buildings. Three hotels have been bombed and damaged. Since last Saturday and Sunday, the German side has lost a total of 455 planes and 1,100 crew members, while the British have lost 101 planes and 57 crew members. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>Air Raid on Berlin</h3>
<p>Berlin - An air raid alarm was issued in Berlin at 11:28 PM last night and lifted at midnight. No enemy planes dropped bombs. Berlin's anti-aircraft units did not open fire either. According to responsible sources, British planes were unable to fly near Berlin due to the interception by anti-aircraft units, nor did they drop bombs elsewhere. By 12:50 AM, the British planes had flown back to England. (Haitong, 16th)</p>
<h3>London Stock Exchange Prepares to Relocate</h3>
<p>New York - The New York Times reported this morning, citing a dispatch from London, that British authorities are currently considering relocating the London Stock Exchange away from the British capital. (Haitong, 16th)</p>
<h3>German Air Force Uses New Tactics: Penetrates Anti-Aircraft Fire Network</h3>
<p>London - Although Sunday's air raid on London resulted in heavy losses, the German commander continued to send bombers into London this morning to carry out immoral attacks on various targets. It has been decided that German Air Force personnel will change their tactics. Small teams of bombers, led by a team leader, will use gliding and circling methods at high altitude to enter the center of London. The German Air Force is now adopting closely linked and mobile groups of aircraft, charging in from all directions of the British capital, so that they can penetrate the fierce anti-aircraft fire network on the ground from the British side. The method of group bombing of London for the past week is no longer being used. This morning, German planes again flew into the skies over the suburbs of London, but only a few reached the center of London. London has now been subjected to four air raids, and Buckingham Palace has been bombed three times, fortunately without casualties. Buckingham Palace was hit by two bombs, both hitting houses and penetrating the tapestry room used by the Queen as a reception room. (International, 16th)</p>
<h3>German Planes Dart into London Area; Buckingham Palace Bombed Again</h3>
<p>London - A joint public statement from the Ministry of Aviation and the Ministry of Internal Security stated that a large number of enemy planes in two groups crossed the coast near Dover yesterday morning. British fighter squadrons immediately met them head-on and engaged in a fierce battle. Two small groups of enemy planes darted into the London area and dropped bombs. Buckingham Palace was hit by another bomb, but this bomb did not explode. Houses elsewhere in the London area were also hit, with some catching fire. Gas pipes and water pipes were all damaged. A high-explosive bomb that landed on St. Paul's Cathedral was removed by experts yesterday, so the streets that had been closed to pedestrians for several days have now been reopened. Shops can reopen today. It is now known that St. Thomas' Hospital in London has also been bombed recently. A Reuters aviation correspondent stated that the second week of the air battle over London has now passed, and the form of the German air raids has clearly changed. Sometimes single planes attack, sometimes entire squadrons are dispatched. General Goering, in view of the losses suffered by the German Air Force, has to rest temporarily while re-examining the squadrons, which is why single planes are sent out to maintain pressure on Britain. Although this does not fit in with his planned invasion of Britain, Goering has used most of his first batch of aircraft. It is conceivable that the German lightning war against Britain has not lasted two months, and the attempt to invade Britain has not yet been realized, but its air force has reached this stage. This is something that can make people happy. The defensive capabilities of the British fighters and anti-aircraft guns have been demonstrated. If the German side wants to invade Britain without gaining air or sea superiority, its failure is undoubtedly inevitable. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>London - Up to 9 PM last night (6 AM Shanghai summer time), 175 German planes attacking Britain were shot down, breaking the previous record. London issued alerts four times yesterday, and Buckingham Palace was bombed for the third time, although it was hit by a bomb there were no casualties. Thirteen British fighters went missing, but ten pilots were safe and sound. The first alarm started at 10:51 AM and lasted for 65 minutes. Two bombs fell on Buckingham Palace, one hitting the palace tower and penetrating the Queen's reception room on the second floor, and the other falling on the lawn, neither of which exploded. At the same time, many small incendiary bombs fell outside the palace, and the lawn caught fire, but was quickly extinguished. At the time, the King and Queen were not in the palace, and only servants remained, sheltering on the lower floors, so there were no casualties. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>London - Yesterday, the area of the air battle was extremely wide, stretching from London along the Thames to the British Channel coast. Two heavy incendiary bombs and sixteen incendiary bombs all fell on Buckingham Palace, causing a fire that was quickly extinguished. As for the two heavy bombs, they did not explode. Witnesses here said that while attacking Buckingham Palace, after dropping the bombs, it was shot to pieces in the air by the British Air Force. Another German plane was damaged, and the pilot died because his parachute failed to open, falling on a rooftop. (United Press, 16th)</p>
<h3>German Military Headquarters Claims British Planes Lost 79</h3>
<p>Berlin - According to a statement from the German military headquarters, German planes continued to attack London yesterday, bombing shipyards and harbors. The Bromley gas plant was hit, and a gasoline station caught fire after being hit. Railway stations and military factories were also bombed. Air battles occurred at the time. The harbors of Dover and Portland were bombed, and the oil depot caught fire. The aircraft factory in Southampton was also hit. German planes attacked convoys near the coasts of Ireland, Scotland, and England, sinking two ships totaling 18,000 tons, one catching fire, and one heavily damaged. Another ship was sunk in the English Channel. German bombers raided Liverpool and Birmingham at night, causing fires in many places. British planes attempted to attack Berlin but failed. British planes bombed homes in western Germany, destroying several houses in a certain town, setting fire to a school, killing two civilians, and injuring several others. Anti-aircraft guns and destroyers shot down several British planes each. Coastal patrol boats shot down three. In total, the British lost 79 planes, and 43 German planes did not return. (Haitong, 16th)</p>
<p>Berlin - It is said that a large fire broke out in many places at the largest British Woolwich Arsenal last night during the German planes' frenzied attack on London. (United Press, 16th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The German High Command stated that as a result of the fierce battle between British and German planes over London on Sunday, 71 British planes crashed and the Germans only lost 20 planes. It is claimed that German planes destroyed various public utilities facilities in London, paralyzing London and increasing the number of fires. Two water plants, one power plant, and one pumping station were all destroyed. Most of London has been turned into an uninhabitable area. The Portland naval base and the port of Dover were severely damaged, and large fires are erupting. According to unofficial sources, long-range cannons on the French coast are also shelling London, and two British cargo ships of 8,000 tons each were sunk last week. (International, 16th)</p>
<h3>Time Bomb Near St. Paul's Cathedral Did Not Explode</h3>
<p>Berlin - According to a German Air Force report, two water plants and one power plant in London have all been destroyed. Several warehouses on the south bank of the Thames River also caught fire. According to the latest news, 71 British planes have been shot down, and 20 German planes have not returned. (Haitong, 16th)</p>
<p>London - When German planes bombed London on the 11th of this month, a slow-action bomb fell near the world-famous St. Paul's Cathedral. Although the authorities have disabled the bomb, as a precaution, they have ordered nearby residents to evacuate and temporarily isolated the adjacent streets, so that worship services have also been suspended today, which has not happened for many years. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>London - The historic St. Paul's Cathedral was almost destroyed today, because a delayed-action torpedo bomb fell in the courtyard of the cathedral. A heroic soldier discovered it and moved it to a place where it could not cause damage to explode. The bomb was removed by Lieutenant Davis and his soldiers after three days of effort. (United Press, 16th)</p>
<p>Swedish Capital - According to the British Home Secretary's announcement, the heaviest bomb dropped by German planes in London weighed over one ton and fell near St. Paul's Cathedral, fortunately it did not explode. Its timing fuse has been removed, and the bomb will be disposed of in an open area outside the city. When the bomb explodes, the diameter of the hole it creates will be over one hundred feet. (Haitong News Agency, 16th)</p>
<h3>German Planes Bomb Convoy Near British East Coast</h3>
<p>Berlin - According to German military sources, German planes bombed a convoy near the British east coast, sinking two merchant ships totaling 18,000 tons, another catching fire after being hit, and another heavily damaged. In the English Channel, a merchant ship with a displacement of 6,000 tons was sunk at night. (Haitong News Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>British Planes Brave Storms to Bomb German Military Areas; Antwerp Docks Hit Hardest</p>
<p>London - Large squadrons of bombers from the Aviation Corps fiercely attacked enemy ships, military installations, and storage depots in the English Channel ports, as well as enemy supply distribution centers and transportation lines, inflicting heavy damage and systematically destroying the German High Command's invasion organization. British planes braved bad weather and fierce resistance from ground defenses to bomb Antwerp, Ostend, Vlissingen, Dunkirk, Calais, and Boulogne ports, warehouses in Mannheim and other places, and railway traffic in the Rhine and other places, hitting targets. The Antwerp docks were hit the hardest, and the Cap Gris-Nez battery and several airfields were also bombed. One British plane went missing. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>London - According to the Intelligence Office of the Ministry of Aviation, British planes flew out in frightening weather, and were struck by lightning on the way. The electrically charged wind and rain were so fierce that the radio cables on the aircraft backs were burned off, and many aircraft surfaces were iced over. However, the British planes braved these difficulties and dangers, fiercely attacking the invasion "front line" along the coasts of France, the Netherlands, and Belgium, and bombing German bases, railway junctions, and transportation centers. The most severely attacked area that night was Antwerp, "directly pointing at the heart of London." British planes flew on the city from 11 PM (Saturday) to 2:30 AM (Sunday), dropping about 40 tons of high-explosive bombs and over a thousand incendiary bombs, causing heavy damage to large docks, warehouses, gasoline depots, and ships. Many areas in the dock area were hit. The east and west areas were repeatedly bombed from all directions. One warehouse was hit and destroyed. Judging from the intensity of the explosion, it must have stored explosives. Large fires broke out, oil pools caught fire, and there were other kinds of explosions. Coal, iron sand, and stacking yards were bombed, and debris flew high. Part of the newly formed Polish bomber squadron participated in the attack and succeeded in bombing oil operations. At that time, cold air swept through the clouds, fog was everywhere, anti-aircraft guns were constantly firing, and searchlights flashed across the sky. The British planes, undeterred, identified each part of the port and found their targets, launching fierce bombings. The ships in the port of Calais and the surrounding searchlight teams were heavily bombed from 5:30 PM to 8 PM. About 300 barges in a certain shipyard were especially lost. The British planes also used the fires visible from 20 miles off the coast to fly to Dunkirk, braving fierce anti-aircraft fire and repeatedly dropping high-explosive bombs, hitting the shipyards directly. When British planes attacked Ostend, they discovered that the port's defenses had been greatly strengthened in the past week, but they could not prevent the British planes from attacking the large number of ships in the port.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Reviewing the Delineation of the Japanese Sphere of Influence in Vietnam</h3>
<p>Regarding the Vietnamese issue negotiated between France and Japan, the resulting impact is extremely significant and far-reaching, and we cannot regard it as other people's affairs. Up until now, the exact content of the negotiations remains a secret between the two sides. Observing the ambiguity in the French statement, Pétain's weak attitude, and various external rumors, although extremely unfavorable to France, one cannot help but believe that the rumors are not entirely false. Yesterday, the German Haitong News Agency again transmitted a telegram from the Vichy side of France, claiming that the French-Japanese negotiations had been agreed upon in principle by the two countries' authorities; France would demarcate the Tonkin and Cambodian regions of Vietnam as the Japanese sphere of influence; other regions would still be maintained under French sovereignty, but Japan might impose some kind of control. This is also an unconfirmed message from French officials. The same report was made by other parties a few days ago; now it comes from Vichy and is transmitted by Haitong, making people even more concerned and subject to further review.</p>
<p>When discussing Vietnam, the general concept of people may not be very clear. Historically, it belonged to Chinese territory early on. During the Qin Dynasty, when the feudal system was changed to prefectures and counties, the area belonged to Xiang Prefecture. After the Five Dynasties, it became a kingdom by secession, but it always claimed to be a vassal and paid tribute. In 1885, it was carelessly abandoned by the corrupt Qing Dynasty and became a French colony. However, its appearance, beliefs, customs, and habits are still the same as those of China. Geographically, it is south of the three Chinese provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan, with an area of approximately 285,000 square miles, which is one-third larger than mainland France and more than 30,000 square miles larger than the total area of Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. It borders the South China Sea to the east and Siam and Burma to the west, and controls the Gulf of Siam. Politically, the entire territory is divided into five parts: the northern part is called Tonkin, the eastern half of the central part is called Annam, the western half is called Laos, and the western half of the southern part is called Cambodia. Each of these four parts has its own small court and is a French protectorate. The eastern half of the southern part is called Cochinchina, which is a directly administered French colony. China may call it Annam or Cochinchina, but that is not sufficient to refer to the entire territory, so it is not generally called Vietnam, but France generally calls it Indochina.</p>
<p>Assuming that the Vichy telegram transmitted by the Haitong News Agency is credible, then it is known that what Japan wants to take as its sphere of influence is two of the five parts. Tonkin is in the north, bordering China, and includes all of its coastal defenses, Hanoi, Lao Cai, Lang Son. It has the best climate, the densest population, convenient land and water transportation, and abundant rice and coal production. It is the plain of Vietnam and the essence of the territory. Cambodia is the southwestern plain of Vietnam, bordered by Siam to the northwest, and its southwestern coastline embraces the Gulf of Siam. Agricultural and mineral resources are abundant and a prosperous source. The two parts of Tonkin and Cambodia are not connected, so why doesn't Japan mind its separation? An obvious reason is that it is the initial step in aggression, first making separate arrangements, and then swallowing the entire territory like a whale. And its current main reason for seeking the Tonkin region is to encircle the southwest of China; for seeking the Cambodian region, there is another great desire. In addition to its economic value, Cambodia has important military value. Taking Cambodia as a base: (1) further advances would be Siam; (2) crossing the Kra Isthmus would be the Indian Ocean; (3) across the sea, it faces the British Malay Peninsula, about 600 nautical miles from the British naval port of Singapore, known as the key to the Far East; (4) it would form Japan's best and most advanced frontline for land, sea, and air forces to the west; (5) it would trap the American Philippines in a large encirclement. As for the lower cultural level of the Cambodian people (i.e., the Khmer people) and the hotter climate of the area, these are the most suitable conditions for Japan to take as a colony. Just look at its failure to immigrate to China's Northeast provinces in the past two or three decades, which can serve as an accurate negative proof.</p>
<p>The so-called sphere of influence is commonly seen in the history of international politics, but there is no clear and fixed definition. It must be transferred according to supplementary specific conditions. As in this telegram transmitted by the Haitong News Agency, there is a phrase that "other regions will still be maintained under French sovereignty." This shows that after the two regions of Tonkin and Cambodia become the Japanese sphere of influence, the sovereignty of the two regions is no longer maintained by France, but will be transferred to Japan. The absence of sovereignty is imaginable. There is no doubt that this changes the current situation in Vietnam! In this regard, it is a method of taking the pearl and returning the casket, stealing the sky and changing the day, to only call this form a sphere of influence!</p>
<p>Why does the Vichy government abandon the territory in this way? Why does the German government pretend to be deaf and dumb? There is currently no accurate information available to explain. What can be imagined is that regarding such a far-reaching issue, what Vichy can gain or lose, at least, is tacitly approved by the German side. And the flexibility of Germany's attitude towards Japan must be proportional to the strength of Germany's confidence in defeating Britain: that is, the stronger the confidence in Britain, the more flexible the attitude towards Japan; otherwise, the opposite is true.</p>

<h3>Korean Restoration Army to be Established Tomorrow</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Korea has been annexed by Japan for 30 years. For the past 30 years, the Korean people's heroic struggle against Japan for freedom has never ceased.

<h3>Muslims Should Be Referred to as Hui Religious Believers</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Our country has always advocated the republic of five ethnicities: Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan. Among them, the Hui ethnicity is actually the Islamic religion. Like the Mongols and Tibetans, they have a fixed territory and a fixed political and religious system, hence they can be called Mongol ethnicity and Tibetan ethnicity. However, the Hui people are spread all over the country. Although there are more of them in provinces such as Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai, everything about them, except for their religious rituals, is no different from the Han people. In fact, they are the same as believers of Christianity and Catholicism, so they can only be called Hui religious believers and cannot be called Hui ethnicity. In the past, this terminology has often caused ethnic problems, leading to estrangement and misunderstanding, which is a great pity. Although this phenomenon of estrangement has now been eliminated, if the name is incorrect, then the statement will not be proper. It is still necessary to fundamentally correct it. It is heard that the Executive Yuan, in view of this, intends to issue a general order to the whole country that, from now on, Muslims should be uniformly referred to as Hui religious believers and should not be referred to as Hui ethnicity.

<h3>Tominaga Returns to Vietnam from Tokyo; Will Continue Negotiations with Vietnamese Governor; Fu Carries New Instructions from Tokyo; Thailand Claims It Will Station Troops on the Malaysian Border</h3>
<p>Hanoi: General Tominaga, the right-hand man of Japanese delegation leader Major General Nishihara, arrived here by plane from Tokyo today. According to Japanese sources, Tominaga will hold a meeting with Governor-General Decoux tomorrow. It is rumored that Tominaga is carrying new instructions from Tokyo, as the Franco-Japanese conference was at a standstill when he went to Tokyo last week. At the same time, reliable sources claim that, in order to avoid unfortunate incidents on the border, the Japanese army in Guangxi has withdrawn nearly 20 miles from the Vietnamese border. It is said that last week, the Japanese army crossed the border into Vietnam, but retreated immediately because the French authorities in Dong Dang took a firm stance. The Japanese army's withdrawal today is clearly intended to avoid a repeat of the Dong Dang incident. As for the previous border crossing, the Japanese side expressed regret, claiming that the border crossing troops were initiated by individual commanding officers.

<h3>National Comforting Association Holds Autumn Festival Comforting Rally in Chongqing; Representatives of the People Present Flags and Respect to Chairman Chiang, Minister He Yingqin Receives the Flags on Behalf of the Association and Delivers a Thank You Speech to the Rally; Major Cities Simultaneously Hold Comforting Rallies</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The National Comforting Association held Autumn Festival comforting rallies in Chongqing and other major cities today, using the remaining funds from the gifts collected during the spring comforting campaign and other fundraising efforts, totaling one million yuan, as a grant for mooncakes for the soldiers at the front. At the same time, the Chongqing General Association also represented the people of the country in presenting flags and respect to Chairman Chiang and Minister He. The meeting was held this morning, presided over by Vice Presidents Gu Zhenggang and Ma Chaojun, who delivered speeches hoping that the will and strength of the military and civilians across the country would be concentrated, and that under the call of national supremacy and ethnic supremacy, they would strive for military supremacy and victory supremacy, and complete the tasks of resisting Japan and building the country. Then, representatives presented flags embroidered with "Savior of the Nation" and "Commanding with Precision," which were received by Minister He, who delivered a thank you speech. Since the Lugouqiao Incident broke out, Japan has devoted its entire national strength to invading China. Under the unified command of the Supreme Commander Chairman Chiang, the Chinese army has adhered to the established national policy and persisted in long-term resistance. In the past 38 months of war, through arduous struggle, loyalty and sacrifice, the Chinese army has become stronger and stronger in battle, and the Japanese army has become weaker and weaker in battle, sinking deeper and deeper into the mire. The manifestation of these slight achievements is due to the skill and precision of the Supreme Commander's command, as well as the sincere assistance of compatriots across the country. Our army is responsible for defense and is determined to save the country. Faced with this current national crisis, although we have exhausted our wisdom and loyalty, we have not been able to slightly save the situation. Much of our beautiful land is still in the hands of the Japanese, and we only feel ashamed and do not dare to accept the comfort of compatriots across the country for any merit or labor. However, we should sincerely accept the encouragement that we have received from our compatriots. From today onwards, we will follow Chairman Chiang's instructions of "no arrogance, no discouragement," and carry forward the spirit of renewed efforts and indomitable perseverance. We will fight to the end with all our blood and lives, in exchange for the perpetual life of the nation and ethnicity, and to strive for the independence, freedom, and equality of the nation and ethnicity. We will not rest until our goal is achieved. (Dispatch of the 16th)</p>

<h3>US Pacific Fleet Ready to Move Anytime, Anywhere; Defenses of Honolulu Impregnable; Military Projects Underway on Various Islands</h3>
<p>Honolulu: As a result of the deteriorating diplomatic relations between Japan and the United States, the United States is working to defend the first line of defense in the Pacific with unprecedented determination. After four months of unprecedented exercises, the US Pacific Fleet has been quickly completed. Since April 3, the authorities have been extremely secretive about the general situation of the fleet. However, one thing that has not been kept secret is that the fleet is ready to move at any time and anywhere in the Pacific. Naval authorities have confidently declared, "Every ship in our fleet can rival any country in the world." They hope that the naval shipbuilding program will enable the country's navy to be on par with any combined fleet in the world. The US Army stationed in Hawaii is now maintaining an absolute advantage and is waiting with agility. Sentries are patrolling all important traffic and transportation lines day and night. The authorities have also established a plan for underground storage facilities on Oahu, but information about underground airfields has not been made public. If the Army and Navy departments agree, it is believed that this can be achieved. The basic task of the US fleet is to maintain the highest level of gunnery skills. Officials believe that, apart from Britain, the navies of other countries in the world are not as accurate in their shooting as the American sailors. Oahu is now storing large quantities of military materials. Unofficial sources say that the amount of ammunition stored there can enable the fleet in that area to wage a prolonged war. Naval supplies are now being heavily taxed to ensure a steady flow of motor oil and other supplies into Pearl Harbor to supply the more than 100 warships there. The local naval operations authorities never disclose information, but they often make secret deployments lasting two or three weeks. It is reported that aircraft carriers are frequently conducting "foreign patrols." No less than a million people are building naval and air bases on the central islands and Johnson Island, which shield Honolulu. They have established the initial work of establishing a base on Wake Island. The defenses of the Sumay base, at the southernmost tip of Honolulu, have also been greatly enhanced to cope with any eventuality. All of the above is no different from a wartime picture. The supervisors there admit that the defense itself is impregnable. The United States is sufficient to deal with any eventuality in the Pacific. (United Press dispatch of the 16th)</p>

<h3>Remarks of Japanese Diet Member Kawanishi on US-Japan Relations: A Scathing Critique of Clumsy Diplomacy</h3>
<p>Tokyo – According to Japanese Diet member Kawanishi, who has traveled to the United States several times, US-Japan relations have never been as tense as they are today, yet there is no reason for war between the two countries. In an article published in mid-September, Kawanishi reviewed the tensions between the two countries arising from the China Incident and the European War, stating that "the relationship between these two Pacific powers is not uncorrectable, and only requires that Tokyo and Washington engage in negotiations with a straightforward attitude." Kawanishi concludes that neither Japan nor the United States will gain anything from war. He says, "Even if the U.S. Navy could blockade Japan, it could not make Japan submit. Conversely, even if the Imperial Japanese Navy could invade the American Pacific coast from the Philippines and Hawaii, Japan could never advance into the American continent and occupy Washington. Therefore, a US-Japan war would inevitably become a protracted event. In my opinion (Kawanishi referring to himself), there is nothing in the world that would cause more severe losses to both the US and Japan than a protracted war between the two countries." Furthermore, according to Kawanishi, since the gradual progress of the European War to date, the number of people in the United States who advocate establishing an understanding with Japan has greatly increased. Regarding this point, he says, "Americans are different from the British. The British are a pragmatic people, while Americans are purely emotional. Therefore, it is easier to deal with them. The reason why Americans have recently become increasingly anti-Japanese is due to our clumsy diplomatic actions. The result of diplomatic failures has led them to point to Japan as an aggressive nation. If we can be candid, the United States might understand our intentions. Therefore, we must explain to them the true nature and purpose of building a new order in East Asia. We should also inform Americans that since the enactment of the U.S. Immigration Act of 1924, which has adopted a closed-door policy toward Japan, we have had no choice but to expand in Asia. In addition to this immigration law, Australia and Canada have various laws that made Japan realize that its interests in Asia only lie in pioneering Greater Asia." Kawanishi says that if we want to resolve relations, there are three major prerequisites: 1. The China Incident; 2. Japan-Soviet relations; 3. French Indochina and the Dutch East Indies issues. He says that the reason why relations have recently become strained is undoubtedly due to the China Incident. Therefore, when dealing with the China Incident, if we can reassure the United States and protect their interests in China, and guarantee the restoration of their commercial rights with China, the two countries' friction will naturally disappear. After resolving the China Incident, the first thing Japan should do is restore the vitality of the war-torn areas, and this task cannot be accomplished without foreign investment. European countries will generally not discuss this after making such great sacrifices. Asian countries also cannot provide us with economic assistance. Therefore, Japan should cooperate with the United States, and it goes without saying that it is imperative to maintain friendly relations with the United States." When discussing Japan-Soviet relations, Kawanishi said, "As a result of careful study of Japan-Soviet relations, it is clear that improving US-Japan relations is no less important. Approaching the US can also pave the way for Washington and Moscow to establish close ties." Kawanishi, while defending Japan's advocacy of the Monroe Doctrine in Asia, said, "In order to liberate the people of Asia from the oppression of Western powers, the US should oppose Japan's actions in the Far East. Regarding our policies toward Indochina and the Dutch East Indies, we should also be candid and explain them without concealment. In short, we sincerely hope that US-Japan relations can be resolved through peaceful diplomatic negotiations without resorting to force. For example, we should immediately engage in negotiations to allow the United States to export oil, iron, and other materials to Japan, while the tin, rubber, and other products of the Dutch East Indies can also be exported to the United States."

<h3>Japanese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson on Stalled US-Japan Negotiations: Accusations of US Discrimination Against Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo – Foreign Ministry spokesperson Suma, while meeting with reporters this morning, acknowledged reports that Ambassador to the US Horinouchi had protested to US Undersecretary of State Welles on September 13 regarding the US embargo on gasoline. It has been reported that Welles rejected the protest. Suma also stated that the Japanese side had lodged a protest with Washington four or five weeks ago regarding the US embargo on gasoline, considering it discriminatory and unfair to Japan. US Undersecretary of State Welles responded with a written note a week later. The spokesperson refused to disclose the content or nature of the US response. It was also reported that when Horinouchi and Welles met on September 13 to discuss several major issues, almost all outstanding issues between the two countries were touched upon, but none were resolved. When a reporter asked on what grounds Japan's protest was based, the spokesperson replied that the US action was discriminatory against Japan, as the US allowed the export of gasoline to Western Hemisphere countries while imposing an embargo on Japan, which was unfair. He acknowledged that the US had sufficient gasoline supplies and could produce gasoline in any quantity. He also stated that this action by the US ran counter to the free trade principles that Secretary of State Hull had vehemently advocated for many years. Japan has been fighting for the two major principles of free trade and equality of opportunity since the Treaty of Versailles, and we will continue to fight for them." Another German reporter asked whether Japan's protest was based on the possibility of US gasoline being exported to England. The spokesperson expressed his personal opinion, saying that many transactions between the US and England, such as the sale of weapons and ammunition to England, may involve violations of the neutrality laws.

<h3>Japan Establishes Lavish Embassy in Sofia</h3>
<p>Sofia – There is much attention here regarding Japan's recent establishment of a first-class embassy in Sofia. The Japanese government approved the construction of an embassy in Sofia long ago in May of last year, before the signing of the mutual assistance agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union.

<h3>British Press Comments on Air War Situation</h3>
<p>London – British newspapers commented at the end of the week on the air war of the past week. Their general conclusion is that the German air force, using the methods it used to crush the Polish, Dutch, Belgian, and French air forces, attempted to defeat the British air force as a prelude to invading Britain. Thus, they engaged in fierce attacks over the past week, but this effort has clearly failed. The British air force has not only not been defeated, but is stronger than before. The window of opportunity for invading Britain has now passed. The military correspondent for the *Sunday Times* stated that the German air force must now admit its failure for the first time. However, whether Hitler will persist in his invasion strategy remains to be seen. Garvin, the editor of *The Observer*, said that it would be madness for Hitler to launch a large-scale invasion of Britain without achieving air superiority. If Hitler intends to do so, he must risk a try this week. Tomorrow (i.e., Monday) is the full moon and high tide, but Hitler may not be able to do so in time. (Reuter dispatch, 16th)</p>

<h3>Germany Will Attack Britain Next Spring, Italian Press Observes</h3>
<p>Rome – The quasi-official Fascist Party spokesman Farinacci, in an article in the Fascist regime newspaper, stated that Germany will not launch its final attack on Britain until next spring. However, it will begin major preparations during this winter. Farinacci said that Germany's attack plan against Britain will be the same as the one used against France. Germany also spent nine months preparing before attacking France. Therefore, Germany will only begin the attack when it is confident of victory. Germany remained very calm during the war against France, allowing the winter to pass in order to prepare fully for victory in the coming year. Its policy will naturally be the same in dealing with the war against Britain. When the time comes and it is possible to exchange victory for a few sacrifices, it will launch the final attack.

<h3>Further Talks on the European War (7): The Enormous Military Expenditure of Germany</h3>
<p>Regarding the situation of Germany's military preparations, this newspaper has previously translated a report from a "New York Times" correspondent. Now, we translate and record the massive scale of German military spending as reported in the "Christian Science Monitor" below. Compared with the situation in France, they are worlds apart.</p>
<p>The total amount of German military expenditure is still difficult to estimate, but according to an analysis by the U.S. Department of Commerce at the outbreak of the European War, German military expenditure accounted for 47% of national income in the fiscal year 1938-1939. To date, this percentage has likely increased significantly.</p>
<p>Germany has already gone bankrupt internationally and is experiencing a severe lack of resources. How can it disregard economic and financial principles and exploit resources in this way?</p>
<p>Six years ago, Germany was extremely short of gold and foreign exchange, its credit was bankrupt, and it declared a suspension of all foreign debt payments. At that time, Hjalmar Schacht, then President of the German Reichsbank, constantly lamented Germany's dependence on foreign raw materials and appealed to the world for "compromise, tolerance, and goodwill." From a financial and economic point of view, Germany seemed to have reached the end of its rope.</p>
<p>However, within a few months, German Chancellor Hitler was accelerating a large-scale and costly military expansion plan.</p>
<p>Last autumn, he announced that he had spent 90,000,000,000 marks on expanding the military. This was hard for other countries to believe. At that time, it was difficult to calculate how much the German currency, due to its lack of gold backing and its inability to be freely bought and sold on the world market, was worth in U.S. dollars, but according to the officially stipulated exchange rate, it could be converted to $36,000,000,000.</p>
<p>The current amount of military spending in Germany is unknown, but its magnitude is undoubtedly enormous. British estimates suggest it requires $15,000,000,000 per year. Other estimates are even higher.</p>
<p>Economists explain that the principle of estimating wartime military expenditure based on peacetime economic standards is no longer applicable. In 1914, almost all economists agreed that Germany could only afford to wage war for a few months financially. But Germany spent as much as $186,000,000,000 in the last World War, excluding the loss of life, destruction of property, depreciation of capital, and loss of trade. It's seven times the total expenditure of the U.S. government from 1789 to 1916.</p>
<p>In modern warfare, ground forces must use mechanized units, and the skies must use aircraft. The cost will inevitably be much greater than in the 1914-1918 era. How can impoverished Germany carry out its adventurous campaign to conquer all of Europe? We trace back to the early days of the Nazi Party's rule.</p>
<p>At the beginning of his rule, Hitler discovered that 30% of German people were unemployed, factories were shut down, and the treasury lacked money to purchase essential raw materials and food. In such a crisis, the German people obediently accepted the system of control over industry, labor, trade, and finance, which was unprecedented in modern industrialized countries.</p>
<p>Similar control systems continue to be strengthened today. If you are a German, the government will tell you what you can eat, what you can wear, where to work, when to work, how much you can earn, and how much you should pay for your necessities.</p>
<p>If you are an industrialist, you will be told what to manufacture, what to sell, and the remaining profits after paying taxes should be lent to the government. If you run a savings bank or insurance company, you will be told where to invest your funds.</p>
<p>Until recently, the British government obtained the same overwhelming power from Congress. The centralization of power is a massive and detailed project that takes a long time. Hitler has been carrying out this plan for six years.</p>
<p>The funds that Germany currently uses for war are not only derived from huge taxes, not only borrowed from the people's savings controlled by the government, but also require strict sacrifices in people's lives.</p>
<p>In terms of food, one person can only eat one pound of meat per week. Apart from that, only cabbage and sweet potatoes can be eaten in limited quantities. As for clothing, each person is only allowed to buy a few items each year. The amount allotted to each person is even less than that of a Russian prisoner. Women are only allowed to wear four pairs of socks per year.</p>
<p>Economists explain that the entire strength of Germany has been mobilized for war. Repairs to factories, houses, and other institutions are put on hold if they are not related to war. Walther Funk, the current president of the Reichsbank, said in April that the production of consumer goods should be restricted, and merchants should limit investments in renovation. All savings should be easily accessible to the government from savings banks and lending institutions.</p>
<p>But besides intensifying domestic organization, Germany still has the problem of obtaining important raw materials from abroad. Among the three main raw materials of coal, iron, and oil, Germany can only fully supply itself with coal. Domestic production of cotton, wool, copper, rubber, and other major raw materials is lacking.</p>
<p>However, according to international trade experts, in the years before the war, Germany had already imported large quantities of resources each year, far exceeding its normal needs. In the early years of the Nazi Party's rule, all foreign trade was strictly controlled. The free trading of German currency on the world market was prohibited. American exporters could receive German payments but had to keep them within Germany. Exporters could use that German money to buy German goods, ship them to the United States for sale, and earn U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>But the exchange rate of the mark was not uniform and depended on the nature of the transaction. For example, the official value of the mark was set at 40 cents U.S. An American merchant who sold $40 worth of goods would receive 100 marks. But in some transactions desired by the government, each mark was only worth 20 cents U.S., so selling $40 worth of goods would yield 200 marks.</p>
<p>Even so, Germany's overseas supply problems are still seen by many economists and military experts as Hitler's weakest link. The supply of coal is certainly adequate. The supply of iron can be obtained in large quantities from Luxembourg and Sweden. The supply of food is also not a problem because Denmark and the Netherlands are under its occupation. The most problematic item is oil. According to international oil experts, even if Germany obtains all of Romania's oil production, the annual oil production of Romania, plus Germany's own small output and a small portion obtained from the Soviet Union, would only amount to the quantity produced by the United States in 20 days.</p>
<p>Therefore, most experts agree that, from both an economic and financial point of view, Germany's massive wartime apparatus and frantic actions will have difficulty overcoming the difficulties of winning. Apart from supply problems, some experts also acknowledge that there is the question of how long the German people can endure the sacrifices that the state forces them to endure.</p>

<h3>Serious Tragedy Occurs in the Chinese Military Concentration Camp in the French Concession Yesterday: Clash with Vietnamese Soldiers Results in Many Deaths and Injuries; Dispute at the Lone Army Barracks Still Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>The conflict between the Lone Army Barracks in the Public Concession and the White Russian merchant group has not yet been resolved. Unexpectedly, a tragic dispute occurred in the Chinese military concentration camp in the French Concession yesterday. Vietnamese soldiers opened fire with machine guns and used water hoses to suppress the Chinese soldiers, resulting in more than twenty deaths and injuries on the Chinese side. The details are reported below:</p>
<p>Lone Army in the French Concession's Nanshi District</p>
<p>In November 1937, when the Chinese army withdrew from Shanghai, the soldiers and police in the Nanshi area who could not retreat were disarmed and taken in by the French Concession. They were detained in schools at various addresses, including Route Ratard, Avenue Joffre, and Route Saussoy. After successive releases, all members of the security team, special forces, and other units had been bailed out. The remaining approximately 960 people were soldiers from the 328th to 330th regiments of the 165th Brigade of the 55th Division of the Army. Their detention place was also concentrated at No. 16, Lane 388, Route Ratard. This place was originally the old site of the Weiyu Elementary School. After being occupied, the school moved to the former site of the Better Elementary School on Avenue Lafayette for classes.</p>
<p>Conflict Triggered by Food Issues</p>
<p>The French Concession authorities received 24,000 yuan per month from the Chinese government to cover the soldiers' food expenses. When soldiers were sick, they were sent to the Lao Jian Ti Yuan of the Guangci Hospital for treatment three times a week. The French Concession's surveillance of the camp was extremely strict, and there had been few incidents in the past. At around 10 o'clock yesterday morning, the soldiers in the camp clashed with the guards over the issue of side dishes, leading to mutual fighting.</p>
<p>Suppression by Gunfire Leads to Deaths and Injuries</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news, the French police sent eight trucks carrying approximately 30 Vietnamese soldiers to suppress the situation. The Vietnamese soldiers fired machine guns. According to inquiries by the Pingming News Agency, seven soldiers on the Lone Army side died, and more than 20 were injured. At the same time, traffic on the outside roads was cut off for three hours. The camp's chief representative, Zhang Guangzhi, was taken to the police station. According to another source, the dispute arose because the soldiers requested old wine and mooncakes for the Mid-Autumn Festival, leading to a conflict with the French officer due to disagreements. Vietnamese soldiers opened fire to suppress the situation, resulting in five deaths and eighteen injuries, some serious, among the Lone Army.</p>
<p>Official Announcement from the French Concession</p>
<p>The French Concession police issued an official announcement yesterday, stating that at approximately 12:30 yesterday afternoon, a large number of Lone Army soldiers in the Chinese military detention camp on Route Ratard suddenly attempted to escape and tried to break through the defense line of the French defense forces and police. Although the guards tried their best to dissuade them, it was ineffective. Therefore, the guards were forced to use weapons to drive back the crowd. It is reported that several people suffered minor injuries.</p>
<p>Western Newspapers Report on the Incident</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that the unrest in the Lone Army Barracks in the Public Concession spread to the Chinese military detention camp on Route Ratard in the French Concession today (the 16th). French and Vietnamese soldiers stationed at the Route Ratard camp were suddenly attacked by Chinese soldiers in the camp and opened fire to suppress the situation. Afterwards, several injured Chinese soldiers were immediately treated in the camp.</p>
<p>Wire Mesh and Bamboo Poles Used as Weapons</p>
<p>It was found that the Chinese soldiers in the Route Ratard camp, who were the Nanshi garrison troops who retreated into the French Concession in 1937, suddenly used bamboo poles with barbed wire and other items as weapons to attack the guards and police in the camp. The French army urgently fired warning shots into the air, which were ineffective, and then shot at the Chinese soldiers in self-defense.</p>
<p>Authorities Investigate the Cause of the Incident</p>
<p>French officials told reporters that they did not understand why the Chinese soldiers suddenly launched the attack, as the Chinese soldiers had no complaints beforehand, and their food was quite sufficient. The number of injured Chinese soldiers has not been disclosed today, but it is believed that there were some who were seriously injured. After the incident, the French soldiers guarding the camp restored order, and the situation is now normal. The authorities are investigating the cause of the incident.</p>
<p>Dispute at the Lone Army Barracks</p>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," it is reported that after three days of disturbances in the Lone Army Barracks on Kiaochow Road, several representatives of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps went to the camp this morning to negotiate a solution with Xie, the commander of the Lone Army. The Lone Army put forward a strong demand for immediate release. As of noon today, no solution has been reached. It is believed that the two sides will continue to negotiate this afternoon. The Lone Army soldiers are still furious.</p>
<p>The Municipal Council Will Take Appropriate Measures</p>
<p>This morning, the Shanghai Municipal Council made no statement regarding the negotiations. However, it is believed that after today's negotiations, the Municipal Council will decide on a plan for the future of the Lone Army and submit it to the board meeting on Wednesday for discussion. The Lone Army Barracks incident began last Friday when coolies from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Public Works Department went to repair the football field gate. It was then agreed that the coolies would be allowed to repair it, but on the appointed day, the Lone Army soldiers still opposed it, leading to a conflict with the White Russian soldiers guarding the camp. Colonel Hohn, commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, personally went to the camp to seek a solution. It is rumored that the Lone Army also used force against Hohn, leading to disturbances that have not yet been resolved.</p>
<p>Searchlights Installed Around the Barracks</p>
<p>The security measures around the Lone Army Barracks became even more severe yesterday. Three White Russian soldiers were also stationed in the Kiaochow Park adjacent to the Lone Army Barracks. Yesterday afternoon, workers were seen installing seven 1,000-candlepower searchlights on the tops of the telephone poles around the Lone Army Barracks. The road connecting the Lone Army Barracks to the outside world was still blocked yesterday, so all goods and visitors could not enter. The telephone lines remained cut off. All the Lone Army soldiers ate only white rice yesterday. The Lone Army soldiers frequently showed their heads on the wall, revealing their anger. Since the clash between the Lone Army soldiers and the White Russian soldiers on the 13th, the camp has been under strict guard by the Shanghai Volunteer Corps and the Municipal Police. Several Lone Army soldiers and a small number of White Russian soldiers have not yet recovered from the effects of the tear gas thrown by the Shanghai Volunteer Corps.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow is the 9/18 Anniversary: Citizens are Increasingly Loyal, Actively Promoting the Winter Clothing Donation Campaign; Security in Both Concessions Will Become More Strict</h3>
<p>The ninth anniversary of the September 18th Incident is approaching. It has recently been ordered by the central government that the anniversaries of both August 13th and September 18th have been merged with the July 7th Festival and do not need to be held separately. All sectors of Shanghai society will focus on spiritual encouragement and actively promote the fundraising for winter clothing and savings campaigns, using them as meaningful commemorations. Furthermore, many Northeastern compatriots who have suffered since the start of the war of resistance have migrated with the army to various parts of the south, unable to return home and facing difficult circumstances. A campaign has been launched to save one day's income and remit it to the Northeastern Refugee Relief Association to provide assistance. The authorities of both concessions attach great importance to the security measures for September 18th and have implemented joint security measures since yesterday, with the defense forces of various countries and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps deploying separately for patrol and prevention.</p>
<p>Security Tightened, Curfew Strictly Enforced</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that in preparation for the 8th anniversary of "September 18th," the concession authorities have tightened security since yesterday to prevent the occurrence of unfortunate incidents. However, crime in the urban area was visibly calm yesterday, as it was the Mid-Autumn Festival, and government offices, banks, and various organizations were closed for the holiday, making the scene in the bustling commercial district quite different from usual. Although yesterday passed peacefully, both concessions continued to maintain security and continue to implement the prevention measures that began at the beginning of this month. Since the 18th is the anniversary of the "Mukden Incident," both concessions have tightened security since last night. In addition to the police, the garrisons of various countries and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will participate in the prevention procedures starting this morning. The curfew in both concessions will also be strictly enforced from last night. It is rumored that all nightclubs in the urban area will be ordered to temporarily close on the eve of the "September 18th" anniversary, and police leave will also be suspended.</p>
<h3>Yesterday was the Mid-Autumn Festival: All Sectors Generously Donated, Promoting the Winter Clothing Fundraising Relief Campaign; Military Donations All Changed to Winter Clothing Contributions</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the lunar Mid-Autumn Festival. The silver and money industry, the Shanghai Municipal Council, the post office, customs, and various public groups and factories were closed as usual. Citizens were unable to avoid the customs of the festival, but there was also a strong response to saving money to support the winter clothing donation relief campaign. According to reports from the Xin Sheng News Agency, various charities such as the Refugee Relief Association, the Charity Federation, and the Child Welfare Association, as well as various agencies collecting winter clothing contributions, received a large number of donations. Although the business of tea houses, dry goods stores, and vegetable markets was still brisk during the Mid-Autumn Festival, those in the industry said that it was no longer comparable to the past. Sales volume had decreased significantly, reflecting the high prices and weak purchasing power of citizens. Furthermore, military donations for the Autumn Festival were all changed to winter clothing contributions to unify the effort.</p>
<p>Central Bank Open as Usual</p>
<p>The members of the Silver and Money Industry Association, as well as the bank reserve money industry reserve, and the member banks of the Foreign Banks Association, were all closed for the Autumn Festival yesterday. All receipts and transfers during the holidays will be handled after the market opens on the appointed day. However, the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank was open as usual. As for the various industry markets such as gold, securities, yarn flowers, beans, rice, miscellaneous grains, cotton cloth money exchange, and foreign exchange, the markets were closed as usual yesterday and will open for trading starting today (Tuesday). Furthermore, some factories and businesses closed down and took a holiday for the Mid-Autumn Festival to handle ordinary settlements.</p>
<p>Unpredictable Profits and Losses in Various Industries</p>
<p>The abnormal development of various industries in Shanghai is a thing of the past. Since the beginning of summer this year, freight transport on various routes has stopped, leading to unusual stagnation. The profits earned in the past have been lost in almost all cases, and factory inventories have piled up, with actual sales greatly reduced. Therefore, this year's Mid-Autumn Festival is very different from previous years. Fortunately, various industries have tried their best to manage and barely made it through the festival. However, there is hope that the market will improve after the Mid-Autumn Festival. We fear that problems will arise at the final summary in the future. All firms and banks allowed extensions for Mid-Autumn Festival loans at the request of various industries.</p>
<h3>Bethel Church in Ningbo Bombed by Japanese Aircraft</h3>
<p>The Bethel Church in Ningbo, located on Caowu Road, was suddenly bombed by Japanese aircraft on the 9th of this month. According to reports, a total of one bomb fell on the church, one at the foot of the front wall, destroying several tiles. The other fell in the back courtyard of the dining hall, destroying a hole in the ground. Fortunately, there were no deaths or injuries. The church has now reported the detailed incident to the General Assembly.</p>
<h3>Ferry Carries Passengers, Communication to Yunnan Restored</h3>
<p>Taisheng and Taiyuan to Sail to Haiphong Tomorrow: Yunnan-Vietnam Passengers Restricted to Carry Luggage But because communication to Kunming has been suspended, all passengers going to Yunnan have hesitated. Therefore, the passenger loads on ships going to Haiphong, such as the Taikoo Company's Suzhou ship that sailed on the 8th of this month and the Jardine Matheson Company's Mingsheng ship on the 12th, were not crowded. This was due to the interruption of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. According to a telegram from</p>
<p>Lao Cai, communication to Yunnan has now been restored. Although the railway bridge destroyed between Lao Cai and Hekou has not been repaired, passengers can be ferried back and forth by barge. Passengers traveling from Haiphong to Yunnan can also purchase through tickets. However, the maximum amount of luggage that can be carried is 40 kilograms, and it must be carried by the passengers themselves. The railway will absolutely not allow luggage to be checked in and transported on behalf. Furthermore, due to the tense situation in Vietnam recently, the Hekou Governor's Office has been conducting strict inspections of foreign</p>
<p>Immigration Passengers. Passengers departing from Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other places for Yunnan, regardless of gender, must have identification certificates from their respective service companies, customs, or groups, schools, etc. Otherwise, they must be allowed to proceed after verifying that there are no errors. Recently, ships sailing from Shanghai to</p>
<p>Haiphong include Jardine Matheson Company's Taisheng and Taikoo Company's Taiyuan, which will sail on the 18th of this month. The next departure is the Taikoo Company's Hengyang on the 21st. According to reporters, seats on the ships going to Haiphong are heavily booked, all because communication to Yunnan has been restored.</p>
<h3>Chinese Army Chen Yaozong's Unit Fights Bravely Against Japanese Army, Obtaining Many Spoils; Even Attached Zhang Songhai Killed in Action</h3>
<p>The Chinese army guerrillas led by Chen Yaozong, operating in the areas of Wujiang, Qingpu, and Kunshan, are very active. They have repeatedly engaged the Japanese army and inflicted severe blows, achieving significant results. On a certain day, the Japanese army gathered troops stationed in Jiaozhi, Chenmu, Wujiang, and Tongli to search the Longjing Hospital, but found nothing. They then retreated to the Chensi area to attack. Regiment Commander Chen led his troops to resist, and the two sides fought fiercely for two and a half hours. The Japanese army suffered heavy losses, and only the Second Company of Chen's regiment suffered slight damage. Furthermore, the Japanese army dispatched troops stationed in Zhujiajiao, Jiaozhi, Chenmu, and other places on the previous day, traveling on three motorboats and five civilian boats. At 9 o'clock in the morning, they suddenly attempted to approach the Chiji Bay. The Fourth Company of Chen's regiment</p>
<p>Reported the attack and launched a pre-emptive strike. The Seventh Company detoured to cut off the Japanese army's retreat, attacking them by surprise. The entire Japanese army was surrounded. The battle lasted until after 1 p.m., when the Japanese army was defeated by the Chinese army. The three motorboats escaped to the north, and the five civilian boats were captured by the Chinese side. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered great losses. The Second Battalion and First Battalion of Chen's regiment also encountered the Japanese army stationed in the City God Temple in Zhouzhuang. Due to the terrain, the Chinese army fought bravely and fiercely for five hours. The Japanese army was cut off by the Eighth Company of the Chinese army and retreated in panic. This battle was very fierce. Company Attached Zhang Songhai was brave and skilled in combat, leading from the front. He eventually died in action due to being hit by too many bullets. Regiment Commander Chen Yaozong personally led a strong force on a certain night at 11 o'clock, attacking the Japanese defense area in the southeast, west, and north of Chenmu Town in multiple directions. The Japanese army fled in droves, completely demoralized. The Chinese army captured one steamship and many other spoils.</p>
<h3>Yushan Waters - German Ship Detained - Released Last Night Via Telegraph</h3>
<p>The Hai Yi, a ship managed by the German firm Tongtai Feng Yanghang, has been sailing to ports such as Songmen, Xiushan, and Qushan near Shanghai for about a month. The ship recently departed from Shanghai on the 11th and arrived at the aforementioned ports. Originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 14th, it had not yet arrived by yesterday. A reporter from the Datong News Agency inquired at the Tongtai Feng shipping office on Wuma Road and learned that the ship, while returning from Xiushan to Shanghai on the 13th, was ordered to stop for inspection by a Japanese warship in the waters off Yushan. However, as of noon yesterday, the Japanese warship had not sent troops to board and inspect the ship, preventing it from continuing its journey and effectively placing it under surveillance. At 7 p.m. last night, the Datong News Agency reporter inquired with the company again and was informed that they had received a telegram from the shipowner stating that the ship had been inspected and released to return to Shanghai, and was expected to arrive today.</p>
<h3>British Auxiliary Ship to be Dismantled in the Far East - Replaced by "Daxing"</h3>
<p>The British Royal Navy's auxiliary ship "Hehua" of the Far East Fleet, with a displacement of 1,200 tons and equipped with two four-inch guns, served in areas such as the Dardanelles, Black Sea, and Red Sea in the United Kingdom. In 1927, it was transferred to the British Far East Fleet. Built in 1916, the British Admiralty decided to dismantle it in the Far East, considering it had served in China for over a decade and exceeded its service life. After the dismantling, it will be replaced by the "Daxing" for service in the Far East.</p>

<p>A large quantity of 100,000 tons of bituminous white coal has already been shipped from its production area and is expected to arrive in Shanghai within half a month to meet market demands. In addition, sporadic shipments continue to arrive at a steady pace. As autumn approaches and consumption is expected to increase, various coal businesses have stockpiled considerable quantities in preparation for selling them during the winter season. Regarding the sale of subsidized coal briquettes, despite various sectors requesting its continuation after its suspension, the Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Briquette Trade Association has yet to make any statement or convene representatives from member manufacturers to discuss concrete measures. It is reported that Yizouxing and other coal briquette factories strongly support the subsidized sale of coal briquettes.</p>

It was reported that the residents of that address had moved out beforehand, so nothing was found. Subsequently, they went to No. 1943, near Tushanwan on the same road, and arrested a man in his thirties wearing Western clothes. It was later learned that the man's name was Shen Shikui. Finally, they arrested another person at a residence near the intersection of Route Doumer and Route Courbet, but due to tight security, their name could not be ascertained.</p>

<h3>British Government Issues Interest-Free Loans - Repayment Three Months After the End of the War - Sympathizers of Britain Hope to Help Generously</h3>
<p>With the increased intensity of German air raids on London, the capital of England, the extent of the damage suffered has also become more widespread than in the past. British expatriates in Shanghai, after hearing the appeal from the Mayor of London last Wednesday, have been enthusiastically donating funds to help the families of those affected. The first batch of the "Air Raid Relief Fund," amounting to 2,500 British pounds, has already been remitted to the mother country. The second batch of donations will also be remitted to Britain in the coming days. According to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, the British government recently announced the issuance of</p>
<p>Interest-Free Public Bonds. Those who are willing to lend funds to the British government without requiring interest during the war can send their contributions to the British Treasury within their means. The Treasury will issue receipts and send them back to the lenders. The loan is to be repaid in full three months after the war ends. Another method is suitable for smaller loans, which can be deposited with the Postal Savings Bank, with the</p>

It is reported that the British government hopes that British expatriates in China will actively participate in this initiative, and also hopes that others who sympathize with the British government will lend funds to the British government.</p>
<h3>Rampant Damaged Banknotes - Exchange Them as Much as Possible - Can Be Directly Exchanged at the Four Banks - Do Not Exchange at a Discount Out of Ignorance</h3>
<p>Since the Four Banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China) restricted the flow of new legal tender into occupied areas to prevent counterfeiting, the occupied areas are now flooded with old banknotes. Regarding the exchange of damaged banknotes, a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the Four Banks that damaged banknotes that meet any of the following conditions will be exchanged at full value: (1) the damage is minimal, and more than three-quarters of the banknote remains; (2) although split into pieces, the pieces can be matched; (3) soiled or scorched but the signatures, numbers, text, and patterns are still identifiable. Damaged banknotes with less than three-quarters of the original remaining will be exchanged at half value. However, (1) those that cannot be identified due to being burned, flooded, stained with oil, or painted over; (2) those with less than half of the original remaining; (3) those pieced together that cannot be matched; (4) those deliberately cut, dug, painted over, or with one side removed; (5) unusable banknotes such as sample notes or canceled notes, will not be exchanged. It is reported that the Shanghai branches of the Four Banks have been ordered to handle the exchange of damaged banknotes in accordance with the above procedures. Anyone holding damaged banknotes can directly request exchange at the Four Banks and should not exchange them at a discount at money exchanges or cigarette shops to avoid losses.</p>

The association originally scheduled the departure on the 4th of this month, but the journey was postponed due to road blockades. It is now learned that although there are ships traveling on the Shanghai-Wenzhou route recently, they are intermittent and not smooth, so this plan has been temporarily abandoned.</p>

<h3>Bus Robberies Abound - Gangsters Increasingly Rampant During Mid-Autumn Festival - Notorious Courtesan Loses Valuable Diamond Ring</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin Daily reports that armed robberies on buses in the western district near the Chinese district are becoming increasingly common. Recently, due to the Mid-Autumn Festival, the gangsters have become increasingly rampant. Yesterday (the 15th), they even robbed passengers on a bus in the central district. The incident occurred at 8:35 p.m. last night. A Route 4 bus was traveling along Bubbling Well Road near Park Road. At that time, there were fewer passengers than usual. Suddenly, a Chinese man, Rui Yi, was threatened by a thief, who stole a diamond ring worth 300 yuan. When the bus stopped, the three robbers calmly got off the bus and fled.</p>
<p>Valuable Diamond Ring Stolen and Case Solved</p>
<p>The famous prostitute Lin Xiaoyun, known as "Old Eight," who advertised in Yuli, is 31 years old and originally from Zhenhai, Ningbo. She was once a concubine of Fan Shaoliang, the former president of the Five Hua Bank. Recently, she became involved with the gambling den owner Gao A'gen and now lives at No. 76 Limei Road. In March of this year, her employed maid Wu Wangshi (32 years old, from Yangzhou) suddenly stole a seven-carat diamond ring, a gold watch chain, and gold rings, totaling over 22,000 yuan, and fled without a trace. Until the day before yesterday, the French police dispatched detectives to apprehend Wu Wangshi. Yesterday, she was escorted to the Special Second Court, where Judge Zhu Chuzhe presided over the Eighth Criminal Court for questioning. The police lawyer requested an extension because the investigation was not yet complete. The court ruled that the defendant be remanded in custody and the trial be adjourned to the 25th.

<h3>Xu Chongdao General Store Employees Request Improved Treatment - Store Reports to Police</h3>
<p>According to the Xu Chongdao Employees Organization, Xu Chongdao Chinese Medicine Store on Avenue Edward VII and its thirteen branches have reportedly made considerable profits since the war, but have not increased employees' salaries (the original salaries were a minimum of six yuan and a maximum of fourteen yuan). A total of more than 380 employees are hired. Due to the soaring prices of goods, the employees can hardly make ends meet. Representatives from each store were elected and jointly decided to propose eleven demands for improved treatment, including a minimum salary of twenty yuan per month, a salary of sixteen yuan for senior clerks, and a request for an additional fifteen yuan for rice allowance and a uniform monthly allowance of five yuan. Because the employer did not negotiate, they reported to the police and sent officers to suppress them. The employees now believe that requesting improved treatment is their right. In addition to preparing a document requesting the Shanghai Municipal Council Political Department to uphold justice, they also hope that the employer will understand the employees' suffering and agree to their demands. Otherwise, the employees, driven by the need to make a living, will have to request that people from all walks of life provide sympathy and assistance from a fair standpoint.</p>
<h3>Foreign Sailor Drowning Case - Vendor Accused of Murder</h3>
<p>On March 24th of this year, a foreign sailor from the American ship Bilo purchased a small suitcase from Shao for the price of 70 cents in American currency. Shao followed him to the sailor's cabin to collect the money. Unexpectedly, another sailor, Yarov Nilin, in the cabin was pushed and fell into the Huangpu River and drowned. The river patrol police arrested the main suspects, Shao Mingcai and Yuan Jinsheng (both vendors), while the others reportedly fled. Shao and Yuan were sent to the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, where Judge Zhang Mingsheng presided over the case. The two defendants hired lawyer Zhang Shiben to defend them. Because there was a question of jurisdiction in the case, the court submitted it to the Supreme Court for designation of jurisdiction. After the Supreme Court ruled that the Special Second Court had jurisdiction, the hearing continued yesterday morning. Police lawyer Gu Shouxi prosecuted the two defendants for murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Code. When questioned, both defendants denied the charges. According to witness Qin A'er, Yarov Nilin usually rode in my sampan, but on that day, he rode in someone else's sampan, so I don't know about the dispute. Another witness, Chen Shou, said that his sampan was next to the ship that Yarov was riding in on that day, so I saw the two defendants arguing with Yarov, but I did not see how Yarov fell into the river. The court ruled that there was no significant evidence of the two defendants' guilt and that other witnesses must be summoned, so the hearing was adjourned to 9:00 AM on the 20th. The two defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Tram Company to Reduce Tram Accidents</h3>
<p>Recently, accidents have occurred frequently on trams in the two concession areas of this city due to ticket conductors failing to close the tram doors and pulling the bell to start the tram, resulting in passengers who were still boarding falling and being injured or killed. A reporter specifically addressed this issue to the tram company authorities yesterday. According to them, the company authorities have already</p>
<p>punished the negligent employees, and the judicial authorities have sentenced them to the appropriate penalties. Subsequently, they</p>
<p>ordered all subordinates to ensure that passengers have completely boarded and have their tickets before pulling the bell to start the tram, in order to avoid endangering passengers. However, since the population has increased sharply, every tram is crowded, and passengers rush to board as soon as they see the tram arriving at a stop. Even if the tram is already overcrowded, they still push to board. Although the ticket conductors loudly advise them to take the next tram, it is ultimately ineffective, leading to tragic accidents. It is hoped that passengers will board and alight in an orderly manner in the future, and if the tram is full, do not</p>
<p>board.</p>
<h3>Kidnappers Punished Separately</h3>
<p>Kidnapper Yan Zei Ru Buquan, also known as Peng Guangyuan, was previously a detective in the French Police Department but was dismissed due to an incident. On the morning of June 30th of this year, he gathered accomplices to kidnap Jiang Beihai, the accountant of Yongyu Coal Company at No. 2, Lane 475, Route Paul Henry. After the incident, the French Police Department arrested Bu and accomplices Hao Jinlin, Fang Donglin, Jiang Guiqing, Wang Ahua, and suspect Jiang Yongjin, and escorted them to the Special Second Court for interrogation and detention. Because Jiang Yongjin was not involved in the case, he was not prosecuted. Bu and the other four defendants were prosecuted for kidnapping for ransom. During the trial, Bu died in custody due to illness. Hao and the other four defendants' final trial concluded, and yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Mingsheng sentenced Hao Jinlin to seven years of imprisonment, Fang Donglin to eight years of imprisonment, and each was deprived of public rights for the same term as their imprisonment. Jiang Guiqing and Wang Ahua were each sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment, and each was deprived of public rights for three years. Bu Guangquan's case was dismissed. The defendants were transferred to the detention center.</p>
<h3>Stepmother's Son Accused of Embezzling Common Property - Sun Yingkang Devoured Father's Inherited Public Accumulation Fund - Sister-in-Law and Nephew Sue for Disposition - Ruling Orders Further Review</h3>
<p>Sun Jinting, a native of Wuxian, Jiangsu, accumulated a substantial fortune through business and managing his household. In addition to real estate, city houses, and land worth more than 400,000 yuan, movable property included cash, gold bars, silver ingots, antiques, calligraphy, paintings, and securities, worth approximately 600,000 yuan. During his lifetime, Jinting married four wives successively and had a total of seven children: Xiaokang, Dekang, Xuankang, Yingkang, Yuankang, Lekang, and a daughter Youfen. Except for Yuankang, who died early, the others were all</p>
<p>married and established.</p>
<p>After Jinting passed away, all of the inheritance was managed by the youngest wife, Fang, and her son, Yingkang. Recently, Sun Chen Zhenji, the daughter-in-law of the eldest son Xiaokang, acting as the legal representative of her children, Sun Jingmei and Huangi, hired lawyer Lu Qi to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Local Court against her brother-in-law, Yingkang, for embezzlement under Article 210 of the Criminal Code and Article 335 of the same code, alleging</p>
<p>embezzlement of common property.</p>
<p>The points of the alleged crimes included concealing accumulated public funds over the years and appropriating them for himself. During the distribution of assets to each branch of the family, a portion of the assets was proposed to be used as a public accumulation fund. The use of this public fund was intended to provide assistance to each branch of the family when encountering weddings, funerals, inability to maintain a living, or to pay for educational expenses. However, the defendant seized the public funds and never provided assistance to anyone, which clearly</p>
<p>indicated intent to embezzle.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the 50,000 yuan in cash, 200 taels of gold bars, and silver ingots, antiques, calligraphy, paintings, and porcelain inherited from Jinting were also secretly deposited by the defendant in his capacity as the head of the Shanghai Yongheng Bank, with funds transferred from the Shenyu Qianzhuang in Suzhou. He also forged an agreement with Madame Fang to undervalue the public property and illegally dispose of it to benefit his children. They requested the court to punish him according to the law for the aforementioned crimes. The First Special Court previously summoned them for questioning and ruled for an adjournment for a further hearing.</p>
<h3>Hou Yunqing Prosecuted for Assaulting a Woman He Was Pursuing - Fined as a Warning</h3>
<p>Hou Yunqing, the medical director of the Zhaofeng Sanatorium and a native of Tongzhou, runs a clinic above the Huaying Pharmacy. Wu Yeqi, a wealthy woman from Suzhou, hired Hou to treat her illness. Hou took advantage of his professional position to pursue her, taking her to various gambling venues, causing her to incur significant debts. When Yeqi's mother learned of this, she prevented Hou from harassing her daughter and forbade her from associating with him. Unexpectedly, on the 12th of last month, Hou lured Yeqi to his clinic again. When Hou's advances were rejected, he assaulted Yeqi, causing injuries. Yeqi immediately reported this to the police, and the medical report confirmed the injuries. After unsuccessful mediation by friends, Yeqi filed a private criminal lawsuit against Hou for assault with the First Special District Court. Judge Fang Qinghuan presided over the Fourth Criminal Court for the hearing. Both the plaintiff and the defendant appeared in court with their lawyers. After Judge Fang questioned them, he found the defendant Hou Yunqing guilty of assaulting the plaintiff and immediately sentenced him to a fine of thirty yuan as a warning.</p>
<h3>Business Youths Leave Jobs to Join the Military</h3>
<p>Four young men from this city, Xu Qingyu, Gu Minglie, Sha Zizhao, and Zhang Yong, previously worked in the business sector. Due to their fervent patriotism, they left their jobs together to join the military. On the 9th and 13th, they secretly went to the mainland to join the army. It is reported that Mr. Xu was originally scheduled to marry Miss Shi at the beginning of winter. His fiancée, Miss Shi, had tried her best to stop him beforehand, but he was deeply concerned about saving the country, disregarding personal feelings and making this heroic move, which is admirable.</p>
<h3>Fire at Canvas Shop - Shop Owner Highly Suspect - Maliciously Plotting to Obtain Insurance Money</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 7th of this month at 9:15 AM, a fire broke out at the Taichang Canvas Shop at No. 225 Tokyo Road. It was caused by apprentices Shi Zibing (from Ningbo, 17 years old) and Xin Afa (from Jiangbei, same age) carelessly handling turpentine, white wax, and other materials while drying and applying paint. As a result, apprentice Xin Afa and Chen Youfa's six-year-old daughter, Mei Jiao, who lived upstairs, were both burned to death. The concerned officers from the Gordon Road Police Station arrested Yuan Bingzheng, the shop owner from Ningbo, and sent him to the First Special Court for investigation. Yesterday, Judge Jiang Shuzi of the Third Criminal Court conducted a trial. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that, after investigation, the Taichang Canvas Shop had a fire insurance policy of 6,000 yuan. The cause of the fire was that the defendant and a Zhou surname shareholder who was on the run had instructed the two apprentices to dry and apply turpentine, white wax, and gasoline, all of which are flammable materials. This work was previously done by the Zhou surname shareholder, but now they suddenly had these two young apprentices do this dangerous work, with bad intentions and the possible intention of causing a fire to claim the insurance money. When questioned, Yuan Bingzheng's testimony was evasive, and he pleaded for leniency. The court ordered him to be remanded in custody and the investigation to be continued in detail. The request from Lawyer Zhang to re-test the process of heating flammable materials in an iron pot on a coal stove in order to clarify the truth was approved.</p>
<h3>Special Second Court Burns Contraband</h3>

The burning was completed at around 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Zhenye Silk Weaving Factory Reduces Production Volume</h3>
<p>The Zhenye Silk Weaving Factory on Rue du Consulat in Hongkou, which previously had more than 200 weaving machines and operated day and night, still felt that supply could not meet demand. Now, it has been reduced to just over 20 machines, and its silk products still lack customers. According to the person in charge of the factory, the reason is nothing more than the interruption of domestic and foreign sales channels and the inability to compete with foreign companies. It is also learned that the cotton textile industry, although not as prosperous as in previous years, is still in better condition than other industries. However, the factories that are currently barely operating have all reduced their scale and production.</p>

<h3>Recent Situation of Northeastern University Moving to Ertai</h3>
<p>Northeastern University is quite stable in Santai. In terms of food alone, the monthly food cost is eight yuan, and the two meals, lunch and dinner, often maintain a record of four dishes and one soup, two meat and two vegetables. The atmosphere of studying at Northeastern University is quite strong. There are often hundreds of people in the library, guarding a fixed seat and working hard at the desk. Six gasoline lamps are hung up at night, shining brightly, and there is even a problem of overcrowding. The current students of Northeastern University include students from all provinces of the country. The number of Northeastern students has gradually decreased. Most of the students come from the occupied areas. When Northeastern students recall the past, they are all heartbroken. The sadness and solemnity are beyond words. They are still worthy of being Yan and Zhao scholars. Regardless of Northeast and Southeast, they are all people in distress. In the exchange of emotions, except for the slight difference in language, it is impossible to distinguish between Northeast and Southeast, or any regional bias. In this situation, they have cultivated a spirit of perseverance and tenacity. They are truly able to give personal accounts and have the courage to take responsibility without hesitation for all patriotic work such as propaganda, fundraising, or donation. In this year's spring Labor Army donation movement, the enthusiasm of the Santai people to donate broke all past donation records. The strength of Northeastern University is really great.</p>
<h3>Southwest Associated University Builds Spacious School Buildings, with Excellent School Spirit and Students Diligent in Self-Study</h3>
<p>Southwest Associated University in Kunming, in terms of life, due to limited funds and location, all kinds of equipment are simple. Near Sanfen Temple in the north of the city, after more than a year of painstaking management, more than 40 student dormitories in the style of model prisons have finally been completed, as well as more than 30 classrooms and laboratories with relatively bright windows and clean desks, and there are also relatively spacious libraries and cafeterias. This is the so-called new campus of the Associated University. Recently, the Associated University, from professors and students to workers, has found that the most difficult and unsolvable problem is eating. In the past few months, the price of rice per shi (Dian people call dou as shi) has risen from 20 yuan to more than 60 yuan, and the food cost has risen from 6 yuan to 18 yuan per month, and there is a trend of increasing day by day. The suffering in this is really hard to say. The atmosphere of studying at the Associated University has always been very strong. Now there is only one library that can accommodate five or six hundred people in the new campus, which is full day and night. In addition, there is a magazine reading room and a reading room for specialized journals in the College of Science, which are also often full. It is a pity that these reading rooms are closed at night. After sunset, the students inevitably regard the eight teahouses on Longxiang Street outside the Great West Gate as self-study rooms. In order to occupy a bright place, they do not hesitate to spend a mao of national currency for each bowl of bitter tea.</p>
<h3>Aurora University Establishes Banking and Accounting Department</h3>
<p>Aurora University, in order to meet the needs of future economic and financial institutions for specialized talents, has added a banking and accounting department within the Department of Economics of the Faculty of Law. Shi Baijun, secretary of the Price Committee of the French Concession, has been hired as the lecturer of this course. The lecture began on September 16. It is heard that the number of students who have registered for the lecture is very large, which shows that the Chinese and foreign university students of the school are very interested in this special subject.</p>

<h3>Second Charity Basketball Challenge Match: New Army Shanghai Star's Strong Lineup, with a Women's Performance Match, Shanghai Star vs. Zhizhong, Enthusiastic Support from All Walks of Life, Donations Constantly Pouring In</h3>
<p>The charity basketball challenge match sponsored by the Shanghai Relief for Refugee Children and Orphanage has started with a grand event the night before last. There are six strong teams who are determined to challenge the Shanghai champion Paramount, including Youlian, Huhu, Liangxi, Guoguang Alumni, Qunyi, and Huqing. Youlian has already lost. Now the second team to appear is the emerging strong team Shanghai Star. Shanghai Star has not been established for a long time. The generals are all strong men from the South, such as Liang Yunhua, Zhuo Guoxiong, Chen Xuechong, Chen Bangzhen, Xu Heng, Yuan Zejian, etc., all old and new famous generals, are all fighters under his command, and center Zheng Qinming is even more famous in the southern basketball world. This is the first time to come to Shanghai and has not shown his skills. This comet has the courage to challenge the all-Shanghai champion who has won all battles, and naturally has the confidence to be sure. It is expected that there will be many wonderful scenes in the future, and give the audience a new taste and a new stimulus.</p>
<p>Women's Performance</p>
<p>In addition to the men's team, Shanghai Star also has a women's team. Heroines are not willing to lag behind, so they are also determined to appear and form a Zhizhong Women's basketball team, which will add a performance before the challenge match between Shanghai Star and Paramount. It is now scheduled to be held this Thursday (19th). Tickets are still divided into ordinary tickets for one yuan and honorary tickets for five yuan. The various sales points disclosed last week will continue to sell enthusiastically. In one day yesterday, 57 honorary tickets have been sold, most of which were bought by the directors of Shanghai Star.</p>
<p>Donations and Prizes</p>
<p>This grand charity competition has been deeply supported by all walks of life. In addition to the three balls donated by the Xiexing Sports Equipment Company for all the competitions, yesterday the Far East Sports Equipment Company donated another one, all of which were enthusiastically introduced by the famous sportsman Qian Xucang. In terms of prizes, in addition to the two silver cups donated by Mr. Li Xiangxu, Mr. Li Zulai has also donated two. At the same time, Kangli Silk and Satin Bureau, which is famous for specializing in making award flags, also generously donated six award flags. Zhang Shuliang, chairman of the Shanghai Star Sports Association, also donated two exquisite silver cups. Yaozhang pearls and jade are distributed one after another, which shows that people are kind and generous. In addition, famous comedians Zhang Yier and Jiang Xiaoxiao, as well as Shenqu famous artist Xiao Wenbin, etc., also voluntarily publicized and promoted on the radio, so the ticket sales will increase significantly on that day.</p>
<h3>Amateur Volleyball Women's Group, Finals This Week, All End This Weekend</h3>
<p>The entire order of the amateur volleyball league is scheduled to be completed this weekend. There will be four games on the 21st and 22nd of the weekend. In Group A, Shanghai Star White vs. Mingde, the championship has already been won by Shanghai Star White, and the outcome is not important. In Group B, the last game between the Fire Brigade and Huayan is also insignificant. Only the women's group forms a three-legged situation, with Youxing, Shanghai Star, and Weiwei teams having equal points. A single round robin system is used to resolve the championship. In the first game between Youxing and Weiwei the other day, Youxing unfortunately lost to the opponent with a score of one to two. The two games on the weekend are Youxing vs. Shanghai Star on Saturday and Shanghai Star vs. Weiwei on Sunday. If Youxing loses to Shanghai Star, then Shanghai Star vs. Weiwei will be the final. If Youxing wins Shanghai Star and Weiwei loses to Shanghai Star, then a triangular situation will be formed again and a re-determination will be made. The schedule for the weekend is as follows:</p>

<h3>Yinqian Cup Ping Pong Performance, Wang Qing Representative Produced</h3>
<p>Zhang Yongru and other ten female generals were selected. Shanghai women's table tennis has always been ignored by all walks of life, resulting in talents and levels being difficult to compete with men, which is a great pity. In view of this, the Shanghai Women's Youth Association hosted the All-Shanghai Women's Table Tennis Training Class last spring to promote it. Hundreds of people participated. In order to expand it, the association specially organized the "Women's Youth Table Tennis Team" and hired Mr. Chen Linsheng as the instructor. The Women's Youth has worked hard under his leadership for a year, and talents have emerged. They once defeated the men's team in a friendly match. The whole team is strong and the talents are average, which is rare in the history of women's table tennis. The enthusiastic promotion of the association has also attracted attention from all walks of life in Shanghai. Peicheng Girls' School responded first, followed by the Municipal Council Girls' School, Huadong Girls' School, Soochow University, and Baolian Industry Women's Team. Now, in order to promote women's table tennis, the Women's Youth Team has specially participated in the Yinqian Cup League. The league authorities have exceptionally allowed it as a performance item. The list of all the team members was produced yesterday, including Zhang Yongru (captain), Wang Guangmei (secretary), Hu Jiahe, Yang Chengdi, Fang Xiuwen, Zhu Shangxin Zhang Dexin, Xu Ruilan, Wang Mingxia, and Tao Lanying as official representatives, and He Jinxia, Zhang Yixuan, Fang Yangchu, and Zhu Min as new forces. It is heard that Chen has been supervising the training for days, preparing to compete with each team, and there will definitely be excellent performances.</p>

<h3>Economic Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Feng Liutang</p>
<p>Calculation, Counting Rods, and the Abacus</p>
<p>The numerals used in Chinese calculations are generally of three kinds: (1) namely one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. These are the basic forms of numerals. (2) Namely 壹, 貳, 叁, 肆, 伍, 陸, 柒, 捌, 玖, 拾. These are commonly known as the "capitalized" numerals, mostly borrowed characters. (3) The "code numerals" used in the commercial and industrial sectors (see below), now also called "commercial numerals."</p>
<p>The first kind is borrowed for use as capitalized numerals (except for 壹, 貳, 叁, which were originally numerals) precisely because their strokes are more complex and not easily altered. Therefore, official documents (even now) and the writing of amounts on checks all use them. However, for ordinary bookkeeping, the basic form of numerals or the code numerals are still used for their ease of writing.</p>
<p>The origin of code numerals is ancient, but its source is unknown. In the past, people only knew that they existed but did not seek to understand why; moreover, they thought of them as a trivial commercial skill, not worth researching or investigating. Even those who knew their function were unwilling to put it in writing, which has led to modern people forgetting their ancestors. The desire to know what they were and why they existed has become unattainable. Several years ago, I was asked by a friend to write about this, but I was too lazy to put pen to paper. Now, seeing an article in this newspaper about the origin of Arabic numerals that touches on code numerals, I feel compelled to express my views and serve as a pioneer in researching code numerals.</p>
<p>"Code numerals" should be written as "counting rod numerals" (the "dock" in "dock numerals" is also written with the "rod" radical, not with the "code" radical, the "code" in "Morse code"). The origin of counting rod numerals is the counting rods used in the game of pitch-pot. The counting rods are the arrows of the game; the marker is the rod placed for the winner to keep score. The Book of Rites states in its section on pitch-pot: "After the regular cup has been drunk, please place a marker for the winner. One marker follows two markers, and after three markers are placed, please add more."</p>
<p>Kong Yingda said: "Placing markers means taking counters as markers to represent the winning score. Each win results in the placement of one marker. The ritual is based on the rule of three; after three markers are placed, please add more markers, meaning that the victory is complete." It also says:</p>
<p>"Counters are one foot and two inches long."</p>
<p>This refers to their length. But "counter" and "marker" are really the "substance" and the "function." Therefore, it is said:</p>
<p>"Each marker is worth its counter."</p>
<p>Pitch-pot</p>
<p>The marker is pictorial, embodying martial spirit in the game of pitch-pot, and is used to count the score of the winner.</p>
<p>The characters 筭 and 算 were originally different when they were created. The Shuowen Jiezi (Explanation of Script and Analysis of Characters) under the bamboo radical defines 筭 as:</p>
<p>"筭, six inches long, used for counting numbers; from bamboo and 弄 (nòng, to play with), one must constantly play with them to avoid mistakes."</p>
<p>The Shuowen Jiezi was written by someone during the Eastern Han Dynasty. At that time, the counters were six inches long, which is still about four inches according to today's measurement. Later, it was reduced to slightly over one inch. However, the explanation says that calculation requires constant practice to avoid errors, so 筭 contains 弄, deeply capturing the essence of learning calculation. Even those who study calculation today must practice constantly to succeed, showing that Chinese character creation can embody the meaning of how to succeed in learning calculation. It also says:</p>
<p>"算 (suàn), number; from bamboo and 具 (jù, tool), pronounced like 筭."</p>
<p>Duan Yucai commented: "筭 is the tool for calculation, and 算 is the function of 筭. The two characters have the same sound but different meanings." He also said: "算 refers to 筭 being used, different from using 算 to denote numbers, it means calculating." One is a noun, and the other is a verb. Among the characters related to divination, the one that best shows the form of counting rods is</p>
<p>“卦”</p>
<p>The shape of this character clearly shows the vertical and horizontal arrangement of counters, resembling the prototype of a calculating array.</p>
<p>Regarding the use of counters, the Shuowen Jiezi says:</p>
<p>"籌 (chóu), arrow for pitch-pot. From bamboo and 壽 (shòu, longevity, sound), Xu Kai said, the arrow for pitch-pot, its shape is like chopsticks, people use it to calculate numbers."</p>
<p>籌 originally referred to the arrows used in pitch-pot. The number of arrows successfully thrown determined the placing of markers to calculate wins and losses, and the use of 籌 was no different from that of markers. Thus, "籌" (counting rod) and "馬" (marker) became linked, forming the term "籌馬" (counting rod marker), a general term for calculating numbers in later generations. Although the system of counting rod calculation has been abolished, the use of counting rods to count numbers still prevails today. For example, warehouses still use bamboo sticks to count goods in and out. Therefore, Lao Yuchu said in his discussion on counting rod calculation: "算 is the proper name; 籌 is the common name; 數 is the pronunciation for using them to calculate. Their material is bamboo, their shape is like chopsticks, and their color is either red or black (positive counters are red, negative counters are black). Their length varies, being long in the past and short now. In ancient times, people sat on the ground to use them, laying out the calculation array on the ground, so they should be long; later generations used them on desks, so they should be short. Understanding this clarifies the reason why Zhang Liang borrowed chopsticks to represent strategies. In the early Han Dynasty, people still retained the habit of sitting on the ground (such as Emperor Wen of Han not noticing the length of the mat, showing the use of mats at that time). However, since 算 and 籌 were similar in shape, 'borrowing chopsticks' could 'replace counting rods,' but later people used the phrase without understanding why chopsticks could replace counters."</p>
<p>Now that the origin of counting rod calculation is clear, we can explore its form to understand the origin of counting rod numerals. In counting rod calculation, the arrangement of numbers 1, 2, 3, 4... has both vertical and horizontal formats (see figure). When arranging the counters, vertical and horizontal arrangements are alternated to avoid confusion. What is remarkable is that although counting rod calculation and written calculation differ across time, places, and cultures, the numbers are always listed from the left. The position of zeros in counting rod calculation (such as the zero between two numbers and the unit zero) is represented by a space, while in written notation, a zero is used. The placement of digits according to their place value is the same whether using counting rod or written calculation. Regardless of time or place, human consciousness is innate, so what humans create is largely similar with minor differences.</p>
<p>The loss of counting rod calculation, it is unknown when it began. I have examined the histories of the Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, but it is difficult to find traces of it. Generally, counting rod calculation was still prevalent during the Tang Dynasty, as can be seen in the biography of the monk Yi Xing, who created the Dayan Calendar in the Book of Tang:</p>
<p>"Yi Xing sought teachers and mentors to master the Dayan calendar. He went to the Qingliang Temple on Mount Tiantai and saw a courtyard with a dozen ancient pine trees and a stream flowing in front of the door. Yi Xing stood between the gate screen and heard monks in the courtyard arranging counters and saying to their disciples: 'Today, a disciple will come from afar seeking my calculation method. He has already arrived at the door. Is there no one to lead him in?' Then he removed a counter and said again: 'The water in front of the door will flow westward, and the disciple will also arrive.' Yi Xing accepted his words and rushed in, bowing and begging for the method, and received all his skills, and the water in front of the door indeed flowed westward."</p>
<p>After this, although the laws and calendars changed, the only mention of counting rod calculation in writings is the "Counting Rod Calculation" in the Ming History Art and Literature Catalogue by Luo Yagu. During the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty, Mei Wending wrote "Study on Ancient Calculating Instruments," indicating that counting rod calculation was already lost.</p>
<p>When written calculation entered China, it is also impossible to ascertain, but it must have been during the Yuan Dynasty. In the fourth year of the Yuan Dynasty, the Muslim astronomer Jamal al-Din presented a ten-thousand-year calendar using his native calendar, with 365 days as a year, without intercalary months but with intercalary days. In the early Hongwu period of the Ming Dynasty, an official position was specially established for the Muslim calendar to manage its affairs, but it was later abolished. Afterwards, the calendar lost its order, and the timing of solar and lunar eclipses often did not match. Even on the night of the new moon, a crescent moon could be seen. Matteo Ricci came to China, bringing Western astronomy with him, and studied with Xu Guangqi and others in Shanghai. Xu then presented the theories of Western astronomy and, together with Diego de Pantoja, Sabatino de Ursis and others (all Western Catholic priests), revised the calendar. Later, other Catholic priests came to China, including Johann Adam Schall von Bell, Niccolò Longobardo, Luo Yagu, Johann Adam Schall von Bell, etc., all of whom have significant histories in Chinese astronomy. During the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty, Johann Adam Schall von Bell was even imprisoned for lecturing on the calendar, but his calculations were eventually proven accurate, and Ferdinand Verbiest (also a Western priest) rose up to exonerate him. Verbiest also manufactured cannons for Emperor Kangxi to quell the Three Feudatories. (It is noted that Xu Guangqi also advocated building cannons together with the priests to resist the Qing army, but this was rejected by the Ministry of War. Incompetent officials harmed the country, only knowing their own interests and not the public good.) Since the entry of written calculation into China, Chinese arithmetic has undergone a major change, and the decline of counting rod calculation is one of the major reasons.</p>
<p>Because counting rod calculation was used, the results of the calculations were recorded, depicting their shape, and becoming the popular counting rod numerals of today. This can be clearly seen in the attached figures. Counting rod numerals are the symbols for counting with counting rods. However, only 〡, 〤, and 文, three of the markers, do not match the shapes of counting rod calculations. These still need to be verified.</p>
<p>〡 is the shape of two crossed rods. Tracing its origins, it is the ancient character for "five," so it is unrelated to 〡. 〤 is the writing of "five" in one stroke (see attached figure), so it does not come from counting rod calculation. If 〡 and 〤 were arranged according to counting rod calculation, they would be either four or five strokes, or four or five vertical lines. The number of vertical lines is too many, making it inconvenient for writing, so simplification was sought, resulting in 〡 and 〤. The transformation of "nine" into "文" is also derived from counting rod calculation, but its form has been changed. The upper vertical stroke in counting rod calculation represents five, so "nine" is written as 文, with five on top and four below, adding up to nine.</p>
<p>Since counting rod numerals are derived from counting rod calculation, it is most appropriate to call them "counting rod markers." Calling them "commercial markers" is inaccurate, as the use of these markers is not limited to the commercial sector.</p>
<p>The abacus is merely the application of the principles of counting rod calculation to create a calculating tool. The abacus is the same to the counting rod except that the five-unit beads are placed on the horizontal bar, slightly differing from the horizontal format of counting rod calculation (in fact, it is still consistent. When adding one to four on the abacus, one first adds five and then subtracts four, and the five is on the upper bar. If one does not subtract four after adding five, it is still the same as the counting rod). The rest are all similar to the horizontal arrangement of counting rods (see attached figure). As for when the abacus originated, I have searched the historical records but could not find it. (I have not read many histories, so perhaps it exists but I have not found it! I don't know if there is any record of this in Mei Wending's "Collection of Books," but I regret that I have not seen the book.) However, it seems that counting rod calculation has gradually been lost since the Yuan and Ming dynasties. There must have been something that rose to replace it at that time. Otherwise, a calculation tool, indispensable in daily life, would not have been lost. It is suspected that the abacus was already invented at that time. Moreover, the formulas for the abacus originally came from counting rod calculation. The origins of the formulas are ancient. Hong Zhai of the Song Dynasty recorded common sayings in the "Continued Writings of Hong Zhai," such as "three four twelve, three six eighteen..." He said that Huainanzi and Du Yu's annotation of Zuo Zhuan had the sentence "eight eight sixty-four" (I cannot remember the original text, only the general meaning), indicating that it was already popular between the Han and Jin dynasties. This provides further evidence that the multiplication table currently used is derived from ancient counting rod calculation.</p>
<p>The transformation from counting rod calculation to abacus is an advancement in Chinese calculation tools. Using rods to arrange counters is not as convenient as the free movement of circular beads on a cylindrical frame. Each rod fixes the number of beads, with one bead on the upper bar representing five and each bead on the lower bar representing one, which is essentially the same as counting rod calculation. However, during operations, except for the occasional simultaneous use of two beads on the upper bar, the beads on the upper and lower bars are usually sufficient, unlike counting rods, which are easily confused, and the positioning is not as fixed as on the abacus. The abacus is more flexible than counting rod calculation, so people prefer to use it, and counting rod calculation is no longer considered.</p>
<p>For addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, the abacus is faster than written calculation. Lao Yuchu's "Study on Counting Rod Calculation" also states that square root extraction is faster with counting rod calculation than with written calculation, but I have not tried it. However, I believe that except for the newly invented calculators, the abacus is the most convenient calculation tool. Although there is the regret that errors are not easily detected, this is due to the lack of "constant practice." Those who practice constantly will rarely make mistakes. This can be seen in the several famous abacus masters in the money industry, who move the beads like flying, causing those who are fast at written calculation to sigh in admiration. Even modern calculators are sometimes not as fast. It is a pity that although the number of abacus learners has gradually become common in recent years, those with excellent operational skills are rarely seen.</p>
<p>The fact that Chinese counting rod numerals are derived from counting rod calculation should not be greatly mistaken. However, whether Arabic numerals are transformed from Chinese counting rod numerals or introduced from India, I dare not make a rash judgment before further research. I will leave the theory as is and await future verification. It is noted that the communication between Islam and China occurred during the reign of Emperor Taizong of Tang (Muhammad conquered Mecca and dominated Arabia in the fourth year of Zhenguan, which is the year of Gengyin). During the first year of Qianyuan in the reign of Emperor Suzong, Princess Ningguo was married to the Uyghur Khan. During the first year of Yongtai in the reign of Emperor Daizong, the Uyghurs and Tibetans invaded, and Guo Ziyi took off his helmet to meet the Uyghurs and made a pact before returning. The communication between China and Islamic countries was most frequent during these 150 years. If counting rod numerals were introduced from China to the Uyghurs during this period, it would not be easy to draw a conclusion without a thorough study of Arabian history. As for being introduced from India, it would be necessary to find additional clues from the historical facts of both India and Arabia. However, I have a doubt, which is that the formal structure of Roman numerals is surprisingly similar to Chinese counting rod numerals. Ⅰ, Ⅱ, Ⅲ, Ⅳ are inherently the same as the vertical arrangement in counting rod calculation. Although the form is different from five to nine, the principle is the same. China and Rome are two of the four ancient civilizations in the East, and the numbers are similar. What is the significance of this? There is still room for research, but unfortunately, I am unlearned and unable to resolve my doubts.</p>
<p>"Economic Miscellany" is not often published, not because there is a lack of manuscripts, but because there is a lack of position; it is not written for a lack of position, but also because those with a position should provide readers with content, so "Economic Miscellany" is not published in this newspaper unless it is necessary. In the future, it will be published in "Liutang's Jottings" to seek recognition in the world, but I do not know when that will be. — The Editor</p>
<h3>Further Discussion on Arabic Numerals</h3>
<p>— Shen Yan</p>
<p>I was very interested in an article about "Arabic Numerals" written by Mr. Xu Wenwen in the Commercial News on August 28th. Mr. Xu's conclusion is that Arabic numerals are definitely derived from Chinese commercial numerals. However, as far as I know, what are now called "Arabic numerals" were not actually invented by the Arabs, but were learned from India. Because ancient Indian astronomy was very developed, mathematics developed as a result of need. We can see the Arab's learning of mathematics from India in H.G. Wells' "The Outline of History." Wells said: "...Besides this, the Arabs received further stimulation from a third source, namely India, and mathematics especially benefited from this..." Thus, the Arabs learning from India can be proven.</p>
<p>However, there are two theories as to how India invented these numerals; but whether they are true or not, the author will leave it to the readers to discuss.</p>
<p>The first theory is that these Indian numerals evolved from tally marks. The simplest is to represent "one" with one stroke and "two" with two strokes. This is also the case with our Chinese tally marks (not commercial numerals). The author believes that this theory is the most accurate and reliable: (see figure below)</p>
<p>The second theory is that Indian numerals evolved from angles. Because ancient peoples had a concept of angles very early on. The Babylonians, four to five thousand years ago, had already invented angles of sixty degrees. Moreover, angles are very useful for astronomy, and India, as an advanced country in astronomy, certainly had a concept of angles very early on. However, the author believes that this theory is not as reliable as the first, because the invention of a straight line must have come earlier than that of an angle, and it is more mysterious and difficult than tally marks. (see figure above)</p>
<p>Finally, as for Chinese commercial numerals, the author believes that they were also introduced to China from India by Xuanzang after he brought back the scriptures from India during the Tang Dynasty?</p>
<h3>Finance - Changes in British-American Exchange Rates over the Past Year</h3>
<p>Before this European war, British-American exchange rates were consistently around the par value of four dollars and eighty-six cents. Until August 25th of last year, due to the impending European war, capital flight, and the abandonment of maintaining the exchange rate, the British pound fell to four dollars and ten cents on August 28th. In September, the United Kingdom implemented exchange controls, and the London market only had an official fixed exchange rate of four dollars and two and a half cents. As for the New York pound, it could still be freely traded. On March 5th of this year, the British government announced the strengthening of exchange control, and the exchange rate of the British pound against the US dollar fell to three dollars and seventy cents. When the German army attacked Norway on April 9th, it fell to three dollars and forty cents. As the German army invaded the Netherlands and Belgium, it fell further, once reaching three dollars and fifteen cents. On the 6th, the British government announced that securities owned by non-British residents could no longer be sold in markets within the sterling area. The free price of the pound in New York immediately rebounded, and has recently been around four dollars. Last Saturday, it was four dollars and three and three-quarters cents. However, according to the exchange rates of Shanghai's British and American currencies on Saturday, one pound was only worth three dollars and fifty-three cents. That is, according to the closing price of the British exchange rate on Saturday, three pence point six nine three seven five, selling one pound of British gold, receiving sixty-six yuan, forty-nine cents in national currency. At the same time, the closing price of the US exchange rate was five yuan point three one two five. Buying US dollars with the price of one pound of British gold only amounted to three dollars and fifty-three cents in US dollars. Compared with the New York British-American exchange rate, the difference per pound reaches more than fifty cents in US dollars.</p>

<h3>Metals - Tin Plate Shows Signs of Hoarding</h3>
<p>-Flat Galvanized Iron Weak-</p>
<p>Recently, the route for North China galvanized iron has slightly improved, but not much. Asking prices such as six yuan and a half per six-foot sheet and seven yuan and fifty cents per seven-foot sheet are quoted.</p>
<p>Transactions of tinplate in the city are also small. However, it is heard that in the past two days, the industry has been absorbing and hoarding. This is probably due to concerns about the Dutch East Indies. The amount of stock in the market is not abundant. After this search, the standard price will inevitably rise. Therefore, yesterday's price for 99.5% pure tin had to be sold at 1,500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Distinguishing Between Real and Fake Banknotes of Various Banks</h3>
<p>— Shen Yun</p>
<p>Shanghai circulating banknotes, besides the legal tender of the Central, China, Communications, and China Farmers Banks, also include those from the China Workers' and Peasants', China South, and Siming Banks (the banknotes of these three banks are handled by the Central Bank as an agent), the China General Chamber of Commerce, and Agricultural and Commercial Banks (the banknotes of these two banks are handled by the Bank of China as an agent), Zhejiang Industrial, China Industrial, and China Reclamation Banks (the banknotes of these three banks are handled by Communications Bank as an agent), totaling eight banks. Additionally, there is the Zhejiang Local Bank, but most of its banknotes (with the Hangzhou place name) have been withdrawn, and are rarely seen in the market.</p>
<p>Banknote denominations are divided into five types: 100 yuan, 50 yuan, 10 yuan, 5 yuan, and 1 yuan. Each denomination has different styles and colors due to different issuing years and versions. There are also banknotes with place names from other provinces (commonly known as "foreign vouchers"), some of which are usable and some are not (legal tender issued in recent years has no place names and is universally usable throughout the country). Furthermore, some receiving bank vouchers have been converted into legal tender, such as the China Workers' and Peasants' Bank converting Central Bank one-yuan notes, the China Industrial Bank converting Communications Bank one-yuan notes, and the Hubei Provincial Bank converting China Farmers Bank five-yuan and ten-yuan notes. The above are just a rough outline, and the variety is already numerous, dazzling to the eye.</p>
<p>However, distinguishing banknotes is based on the memory and skilled instinct that we should possess. If there is a good method to facilitate checking, wouldn't it save our time and brainpower, and avoid unexpected losses? As for the editor of this newspaper, he mentioned in a previous note that many banknotes had hidden marks before watermarks were introduced, but he was unwilling to reveal them, fearing that counterfeiters would imitate them, and claimed that counterfeiters deliberately left flaws on banknotes to reduce their sentences when caught in the future. However, in my humble opinion, the hidden marks on banknotes before watermarks were introduced were originally for the purpose of identification. The fact that they were not publicly announced is true, but the shape of the hidden marks was not disclosed to the silver and money industry either. As for not publishing the hidden marks for fear that counterfeiters would imitate them, this is not the case. Counterfeiters generally take photos of genuine banknotes as blueprints and then make copperplate prints. Therefore, the patterns on counterfeit banknotes are generally rough and blurry. The hidden marks on genuine banknotes are extremely small, often beyond the reach of eyesight. The patterns on counterfeit banknotes are blurry, so these fine hidden marks cannot be printed. The so-called deliberate exposure of flaws to make it easier to identify is merely due to the limitations of printing technology. Counterfeiters want to make counterfeit banknotes as realistic as possible so that recipients do not notice them. Try folding and comparing genuine and counterfeit banknotes, and you will see that the surrounding patterns, lines, and numerical shapes match. From this, it can be seen that this is a technical issue, not a matter of avoiding punishment. Does the editor agree?</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Regarding the saying that counterfeit banknotes are not made to be realistic in order to reduce punishment, I vaguely remember that when counterfeit banknotes of a certain bank in the late Qing Dynasty were discovered and the case was solved, the counterfeiters presented a counter-argument, claiming that the double dragons on the banknote did not have pupils. However, due to the length of time, the details of the case cannot be clearly remembered. The editor has also heard about reprinting from genuine banknotes.</p>
<p>Now, I will list a table of the types of banknotes issued by the Central Bank, the characteristics of distinguishing counterfeit notes, and the various types of altered notes, for the reference of all sectors.</p>
<p>(1) Central Bank Banknotes</p>
<p>Denomination / Year of Printing / Printing Company / Shape and Color / Counterfeit Notes? / Identification and Characteristics / Altered Notes? / Remarks</p>
<p>100 yuan / 1928 / American Bank Note Company / Black-gray pattern on the front, "One Hundred Yuan" written horizontally under the name of the Central Bank, purple-gray on the back, with a portrait of Sun Yat-sen in the middle / None yet / None yet / All banknotes listed in the table are circulating in the market and are commonly seen by all sectors. A separate table will be provided to explain withdrawn circulating vouchers and universally usable foreign vouchers.</p>
<p>50 yuan / Same as above / Same as above / Orange pattern on the front, blue-gray on the back, style is the same as the 100 yuan note / None yet / None yet</p>
<p>10 yuan / Same as above / Same as above / Blue-black pattern on the front, green on the back, style is the same as the 100 yuan note / Counterfeit notes have rough patterns and are easy to identify, so they are rarely found in the market / Yes / There are Hankou notes altered to Shanghai notes, printed in 1926, which have been discontinued. Counterfeiters alter the place names and mix them in the market. However, the front of these notes is red with a portrait of Sun Yat-sen in the middle, and the back is blue, which is easiest to identify, because Shanghai notes are not red. / The front and back mentioned in the above table refer to the Chinese text as the front and the English text as the back.</p>
<p>10 yuan / 1936 / Giesecke &amp; Devrient / Blue-black pattern on the front, with a portrait of Sun Yat-sen on the left and a blank circle on the right, viewed against the light reveals a watermark of Sun Yat-sen's portrait, gray-green on the back, with the Marble Boat and ancient trees / Yes / Counterfeit notes have slightly thicker paper, blurry surrounding patterns, black shadows on both sides of Sun Yat-sen's portrait, clear squares on genuine notes, unconnected squares on counterfeit notes, fine patterns on the face of the genuine portrait, clear eyebrows and eyes, rough and blurry patterns on counterfeit notes, but there is one distinguishing feature, that is, the watermark of Sun Yat-sen's portrait on the right side of the note is not visible when viewed straight on, but only when viewed against the light, while it is visible when viewed straight on for counterfeit notes. / The "shape and color" column above could have been omitted, but often there are stopped redemption vouchers from other banks that are converted into universal vouchers, small denomination vouchers that are converted into large denomination vouchers. By listing this column, it is easier to compare and identify questionable banknotes.</p>
<p>10 yuan / 1936 / Thomas De La Rue &amp; Company, Limited / Blue-black pattern on the front, Sun Yat-sen portrait on the left, slightly smaller than the Giesecke &amp; Devrient version, with a watermark beside it, the right side of the back is a view of an ancient palace / Yes / Counterfeit notes have rough paper, surrounding patterns are slightly lighter and very blurry than genuine notes, the face of Sun Yat-sen is also not clear, the cloud shadows on the palace on the back have the roughest patterns, which is the easiest place to identify, and there is another feature, that is, there is no Sun Yat-sen watermark in the blank space on the right side, the numbers on both sides are also dimmer and unclear than the genuine ones.</p>
<p>5 yuan / 1930 / American Bank Note Company / Green on the front, with a portrait of Sun Yat-sen in the middle, green on the back, with a view of Sun Yat-sen's mausoleum in the middle / Yes / Many of these counterfeit notes have been found in the market, there are several types, those with rough printing patterns are easy to identify, those with fine printing are more difficult to distinguish, but the face of Sun Yat-sen is ultimately more blurry than the genuine ones, and there is another distinguishing feature, that is, the five-yuan note only has counterfeit notes with the hidden marks "Ju" "Ji" "Xin". The hidden mark characters are black on the front right corner, and red under the seal on the back right corner, the characters are large and noticeable. / None yet / Before this version was issued, there was another five-yuan note from 1928, the pattern on the front was dark coffee color, the back was red, and there was a portrait of Sun Yat-sen in the right corner. This voucher has been completely withdrawn, but it has not been stopped from redemption, and may still be found in the market, and is still universally usable. However, this voucher also has counterfeit notes, which are easy to identify.</p>
<p>5 yuan / 1936 / Giesecke &amp; Devrient / Green pattern on the front, green on the back, the Sun Yat-sen portrait watermark and the scenery on the back are the same as the Giesecke &amp; Devrient ten-yuan version, but the surrounding patterns are slightly different / Yes / The points for distinguishing these five-yuan counterfeit notes are the same as those for the Giesecke &amp; Devrient ten-yuan counterfeit notes / None yet / The three hidden marks "Ju," "Ji," and "Xin" mentioned in the above table for five-yuan counterfeit notes are the hidden mark exchange vouchers that various money houses and commercial banks received from the Central Bank. The counterfeiters used these three types of hidden mark vouchers as samples, so the counterfeit notes also have these three hidden marks.</p>
<p>5 yuan / 1936 / Thomas De La Rue &amp; Company, Limited / Green pattern on the front, light green on the back, the pattern is the same as the Thomas De La Rue ten-yuan version, the surrounding patterns are slightly different, and there is also a watermark in the right corner / Yes / The printing of the patterns on the front of these counterfeit notes is clearer than other counterfeit notes, and the patterns on Sun Yat-sen's portrait are also clear, making it difficult to distinguish at a glance. The watermark on the right side is not visible when viewed straight on like the ten-yuan counterfeit notes, but must be viewed against the light to be seen, but the watermark is not as clear as the genuine notes, the color on the back is dim, and the palace patterns are blurry, making it still easy to identify. / There are five-yuan notes altered to ten-yuan notes. The counterfeiters take advantage of the fact that the patterns are almost the same as the ten-yuan notes, print the number ten on the paper, glue it on, and iron it flat. Just remember that the ten-yuan notes issued by this bank have blue patterns on the front, and the five-yuan notes have green patterns.</p>
<p>1 yuan / 1928 / American Bank Note Company / Green pattern on the front, brown on the back, with a portrait of Sun Yat-sen in the right corner / Yes / This one-yuan note is widely circulated in the market, the counterfeit notes are also rough, the paper is oily, and the eyebrows and eyes of Sun Yat-sen's portrait are unclear, which is the easiest point to identify, and the colors of the patterns on the front and back are also lighter than the genuine ones / None yet</p>
<p>1 yuan / 1936 / China Police Bureau / Red pattern on the front, with a black Marble Boat scene on the right, dark brown on the back / Yes / The authenticity of this note can be noted on the right side of the front, the Marble Boat scene, the patterns on the genuine notes are fine and bright, the counterfeit notes are pale and blurry / None yet / There is also another type of this note, the front and back colors are the same, only the Marble Boat on the right side of the front is red instead of black, and is universally usable like the black one, and there are no counterfeit notes</p>
<p>1 yuan / 1936 / Giesecke &amp; Devrient / Orange pattern on the front, brown on the back, the pattern style is the same as the Giesecke &amp; Devrient ten-yuan and five-yuan versions, and there is also a watermark / Yes / Counterfeit notes have rough paper, blurry patterns, and no watermark, making them very easy to identify, so they are rarely found in the market</p>
<p>1 yuan / 1936 / Thomas De La Rue &amp; Company, Limited / Ocher pattern on the front, orange-yellow on the back, the pattern style and watermark are the same as the Thomas De La Rue ten-yuan and five-yuan versions / Yes / Identification is the same as above / None yet</p>
<p>1 yuan / 1934 / American Bank Note Company / The patterns on the front and back are both red, which are Central Bank notes altered by the China Workers' and Peasants' Bank. The six characters of the China Workers' and Peasants' Bank are covered with a red seal, with the Central Bank printed below, with a scene of a farmer plowing the field with a cow in the middle, and the hidden mark "央" on both sides / None / This is an alterated voucher that can be universally used, there are three types, one is a no-place-name voucher, one is a Beijing-place-name voucher, and one is a Tianjin-place-name voucher, all of which are universally usable</p>

<h3>Two Lessons in Life (1)</h3>
<p>Dear Readers: In the past month, we have introduced to you the sacrifice, courage, and forgiveness of Jesus Christ. Although we could continue to talk about Jesus' other virtues, in order to give you some insight in terms of thought, let us study life. One says, "My warehouse is full and I have no place to store my goods," and the other says, "Jehovah has treated me with great kindness." In other words, the happiness of one person is based on material wealth. From the lives of these two people, we can learn three lessons about life: (1) From looking at the lives of these two people, we can know what is real and what is illusory. Ordinary people always think that what can be seen with the eyes and touched with the hands is real, otherwise it is regarded as illusory. Therefore, they compete for wealth in material things, and want more when they have more, and want more even when they have enough. They are greedy and insatiable, and completely focus their energy on material things, even putting God out of their minds and neglecting their own souls. What a dangerous and heartbreaking thing this is!</p>
<p>Jesus said, "A person's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions." (Luke 12:15) In other words, a person with a rich family may not have a rich life. Many people are burdened by their wealth and cannot live in peace. There are also many people who work hard all their lives, save every penny, and when they are old and weak, they cannot get health even if they have money. If they are unfortunate enough to encounter natural or man-made disasters, the rich can immediately become poor. If we can see through all this and distinguish between the real and the illusory, and cherish what is truly real, then we are truly wise. (To be continued on the 20th)</p>

<h3>Wife's Sacrifice</h3>
<p>— Yan Zhi</p>
<p>"...Sister is not a mediocre person, on the contrary, you are several times stronger than me. But now you are buried in the trivial matters of the family! I am not against you staying at home, but I think you can avoid becoming a vulgar person. That does not mean that you must do something earth-shattering. Is it not an urgent task to nurture the future masters and strengthen their education? Don't look down on small things, they are our reserve army!..."</p>
<p>Reading the letter from her younger sister from distant northern Shaanxi, the wife smiled and said nothing. But I once again felt ashamed and wanted to hide myself.</p>
<p>My wife graduated from the normal school of a famous girls' middle school in Shanghai. At school, because of her excellent character and learning, teachers and friends praised her as one of the most promising. In the days when I first met her, she was already working in a company. At that time, our ideals were very beautiful. We planned to go out early and return late together after marriage, each fulfilling our respective responsibilities to the country and society. Unexpectedly, not long before our wedding, the company she was working for closed down and she lost her job. Then we got married and had children...</p>
<p>My wife began to be buried in the trivial matters of the family, especially after we left my old family. The beautiful ideal finally turned into a bubble! The past seems like a dream. My wife had to abandon books and her ideals, and wander around the vegetable market, kitchen, and bedroom. She became an excellent housekeeper. This sacrifice is quite huge, and I often feel ashamed and want to hide myself when I think about it!</p>
<p>Then her younger sister went to northern Shaanxi alone. Her second sister also became a teacher. I understand how these two things affected and impacted my wife. But my wife's character is quite stubborn. She doesn't like to recall the past. On the contrary, she seizes the present and enthusiastically educates the children. Her attention is completely focused on the three children, as if she entrusts her hopes to them. She wants to pass on everything she knows to them. In this way, our eldest child was able to enter a strict primary school. The second child at home hums the three kindergarten textbooks that her older brother has read to pieces, and our ten-month-old Ah San claps his little hands and laughs when he sees strangers!</p>
<p>In addition, one point is worth mentioning: my wife's love for the children is latent. She educates the children like a park gardener taking care of the flowers and trees he planted, and at the same time he understands that those flowers and trees belong to the public.</p>
<p>Reading the letter from her younger sister from distant northern Shaanxi, the wife smiled and said nothing. But I once again felt ashamed and wanted to hide myself.</p>
<p>I don't know how many other people have made sacrifices like my wife!</p>
<p>War</p>
<h3>War and Climate</h3>
<p>— Shi Tao</p>
<p>Human material civilization is so developed, and human wars seem to be becoming more and more frequent. Recently, general astronomers have been enthusiastically studying the relationship between war and climate. They believe that the sunspots have a great relationship with war. The more sunspots there are, the more excited humans become due to the stimulation of ultraviolet radiation, leading to the outbreak of war. However, their arguments have not yet matured. We will put aside for the moment how much influence the number of sunspots has on the occurrence of war. At least climate has a great relationship with combat: it is not uncommon for humans to use the variations of severe cold, heavy rain, dense fog, etc. to make special strategies. Kongming borrowing arrows in Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a perfect example.</p>
<p>In peacetime, meteorological business is international. In order to make accurate weather forecasts, it is necessary to exchange meteorological information with neighboring countries. However, in today's wartime, when iron crows are flying everywhere, belligerent countries are keeping meteorological information secret, because if the other party knows the climate here, the crisis of being bombed by enemy planes will be even greater. According to American newspapers and periodicals, the European belligerent countries have recently implemented meteorological controls and are also trying their best to collect meteorological information from the enemy.</p>
<p>The confidentiality of meteorological information to prevent enemy aircraft from being active is certainly a major reason. After the outbreak of the European War, the British and French did not implement meteorological control for a long period of time, which resulted in London being bombed by German aircraft countless times. The United Kingdom has learned from the past lessons and will naturally not repeat the same mistakes.</p>
<p>In this great war, poison gas does not seem to have been used yet. Of course, the release of poison gas and the spread of bacteria are prohibited by international law in wartime, but even if it is not prohibited, poison gas is difficult to use in war. In order for gas warfare to be effective, it must meet three conditions: (1) There must be a large amount of gas material, (2) The wind force is weak, the wind is blowing towards the enemy, and there must be a temperature inversion layer, The replenishment of gas materials is now very difficult, and the accumulation of gas also takes a considerable amount of time, so it is impossible to meet the needs of emergencies, As for the second condition, it is even more noteworthy, Once the poison gas is released, it will dissipate after a considerable period of time, and its density will gradually decrease until it loses its effectiveness, Poison gas is most suitable in a wind speed of about one and a half meters, In order for the released poison gas to stay on the ground for a long time, there must be a temperature inversion layer of at least two meters high on the ground. However, this so-called temperature inversion only occurs on clear mornings, It is naturally a necessary condition for the wind to blow towards the enemy, but when the wind speed is one and a half meters per second, the general wind direction is uncertain, It will be a southerly wind for a while, and then it will suddenly become a northerly wind, Moreover, the wind direction is also prone to sudden changes due to the influence of terrain, Therefore, the time to spread poison gas and is subject to many restrictions.</p>
<h3>Essay: Longing for Hometown</h3>
<p>— Pin Pin</p>
<p>I have always longed for my hometown. My father said: Our hometown is behind the sea and in front of the mountain. What a beautiful place this is, even now I think about it. The sea must be roaring, and the mountains must be flashing with five colors in the sunset; a world of music and painting, which cannot be described in words.</p>
<p>My hometown is also a fragrant world, because it is located in the south, with the fragrance of fruit trees and exotic flowers, and the fragrance of seafood and delicacies. In the past, whether my father returned to his hometown or people from the hometown came to Shanghai, they always brought many fragrant things to eat, such as hexagonal star fruit, lumpy pineapples, flat dried yuyus fish, and round sweet potato heads... I devoured them like a hungry ghost. When I was a child, everyone called me a "glutton," but who wouldn't be a glutton in front of these fragrant things? When I grew up, I wasn't a glutton anymore, but there were also few things to put in my mouth - my father was often unemployed and couldn't afford to buy them.</p>
<p>And now there is nothing left. Not only are there no star fruit and pineapples, but there is not even the sea and the mountains. The sea and the mountains are covered with dim shadows. Music turns into wails, and the picture turns into fresh blood, and fragrance turns into the stench of corpses; this is already a pile of broken things.</p>
<p>Oh, hometown, how much I long for you!</p>
<p>From birth to today, I have never visited my hometown, because there was no opportune opportunity. I have been buried in the city's cave for too long, and I only hate the city. I dream of my hometown, I think of my hometown, what about today?</p>
<p>Therefore, I long for my hometown all the more.</p>
<p>My hometown is broken, but to whom? I know it clearly. I don't complain, I believe that my hometown is only temporarily broken, and in a day that is coming soon, it will surely destroy the destroyer, and a new world will appear in the brokenness. Temporary brokenness is necessary, because it prepares for new life. - Then, roar, sea and mountain! So, raise up iron-like fists! Before many other people's hometowns get the dawn of liberation, mine is also in the light.</p>
<p>I am going to go to my hometown, bringing a pot of wine to drink to the Dragon.</p>
<h3>Am I Old?</h3>
<p>— Pu Ming</p>
<p>There are many successful business people who, although they are old, still have young hearts, feel fresh about everything, and keep overcoming all difficulties, and see the path of life as long and broad.</p>
<p>"Old!" This is the death knell of life. A person's ambition will never be old, and the power of struggle has no end.</p>
<p>Nietzsche said: "You should not love the country of your ancestors, but you should love the country of your descendants." We should not love the past time, but should love the days to come. No matter how great a career you have done, it is not worth crossing, you should still work hard, and there is no time to stop by shouting old.</p>
<p>Hawthorne Case</p>
<h3>The Dancer's Fate</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 7 "Take Him Away"</p>
<p>"After finishing dinner, you went to the movie theater. After the movie was over, what happened?"</p>
<p>"I sent her back."</p>
<p>"Did you go in with her?"</p>
<p>"No, I didn't go in. My car stopped at the door and let her get out alone. Because it was raining heavily, I wouldn't get out of the car myself."</p>
<p>"The movie ended at half past eleven. I sent her home, at most around quarter to twelve."</p>
<p>"Did you see anyone at the door?"</p>
<p>"No - Mr. Hawthorne, are you asking about Zhao Boxiong?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne didn't answer, but continued to ask himself: "At that time, did you see any lights in the reception room downstairs?"</p>
<p>Lu Jiansheng had a thoughtful look, as if trying to recall something. Then, he shook his head and said, "I didn't notice, because I wouldn't get out of the car."</p>
<p>"Are you sure you didn't get out of the car? I think it's better for you to tell the truth."</p>
<p>"Of course it's the truth, I really wouldn't get out of the car."</p>
<p>"I went home -"</p>
<p>Hawthorne suddenly cut him off and said, "Went home? Is that the truth too?"</p>
<p>Lu Jiansheng's body froze, and an undisguisable look of astonishment floated on his face. He hurriedly corrected himself and said, "Ah! No, I went to the Yangtze Hotel."</p>
<p>Hawthorne sneered. "Mr. Lu, you're too forgetful, it's only been a few hours, and you can't remember."</p>
<p>The big belly frowned tightly, lowered his gaze, and his right thumb and index finger were constantly spinning the unlit cigar. This embarrassing state was really ridiculous and pitiful.</p>
<p>He struggled to say, "Mr. Hawthorne, don't take it seriously, it was a slip of the tongue. I went to the Yangtze Hotel to play mahjong, and didn't go home until dawn. I only found out about Wang Lilan's murder when I got home." (109)</p>

<h3>Amidst a Chorus of Birthday Wishes, Let's Talk About Wang Yaoqing's Students</h3>
<p>— Sick Dove</p>
<p>The veteran actor Wang Yaoqing, since accompanying his female disciple Wang Yurong southward last year, has left a very good impression on the people of Shanghai. This year, his sixtieth birthday falls on the upper ten days of the eighth lunar month, so the theatrical circles in the old capital are putting on performances to offer congratulations, an unprecedented grand occasion. Amidst a chorus of birthday wishes, his students are kept extremely busy making arrangements. Newspapers in both Beijing and Shanghai are competing to record these events, which is also a wonderful story in the theatrical world.</p>
<p>Yaoqing is the elder brother of Fengqing and was the first student to emerge under Chen Delin. He enjoyed a great reputation at the end of the Guangxu era. When Tan Xinpei performed, Yaoqing always played the supporting role of the female lead, perfectly matching him in every way. His name was highly respected at the time, and his reputation remains excellent to this day. He excels in all types of female roles – Qingyi (virtuous woman), Dan (young female), and Daomadan (female warrior). After his voice weakened, he devoted himself to dialogue plays, reciting lines with precision and clarity, sharp and experienced, unmatched by anyone. He is especially skilled in performing Qing court dramas. It is said that when he served in the inner court, he was exposed to the behavior of the consorts of princes and dukes, and when he reenacted them, he captured their essence perfectly. He is good at creating new tunes and has a deep understanding of the sounds of words. In terms of costumes, such as the barbarian boots of the Thirteenth Sister and the flag worn on the back by Princess Shuangyang, he created them all. He has made many contributions to the theatrical world throughout his life, and his achievements are no less than those of the veteran Tan Xinpei. On the occasion of his auspicious birthday, it is only right that we express our appreciation.</p>
<p>Since retiring, Yaoqing has made a living by teaching students, and no fewer than dozens have sought to study under him. The following is a list of those I remember; those who only enrolled in name but did not truly learn are not included.</p>
<p>Male Performers: Rong Diexian, Mei Lanfang, Wang Huifang, Shang Xiaoyun, Luo Xiaobao (Xiao, before changing to playing male roles, sang Qingyi), Cuihua, Jiang Miaoxiang, Furongcao, Wang Yunfang, Gou Huisheng, Cheng Yanqiu, Cheng Yuqing, Li Xiangyun, Ma Yanbing, Huang Yulin, Dai Yanfang, Li Zhizhi, Guo Xiaoqing, Guo Xianglin, Wu Lanfang, Wang Shengyi, Sun Shengfang, Nan Tiesheng, Zhang Xiaoshan (amateur), etc.</p>
<p>Female Performers: Xue Yanqin, Xin Yanqiu, Du Liyun, Hua Huilin, Zhang Eryun, Mao Jianpei (deceased), Zou Jianpei, Li Yinxiang, Jin Suqin, Li Yanchun, Wang Yurong, and the recently accepted Lu Ranxiang, Zhang Yunyan (i.e., Qiu Yunyan, who went north), etc.</p>
<p>Among Wang Yaoqing's students, the Four Great Dan are the most successful. However, in terms of actual skill, Cheng Yuqing can be said to be a miniature representation of him. Although Mei and Cheng received instruction from Yaoqing, they did not completely imitate him, instead adapting to their own personalities, drawing on the strengths of many others, and incorporating everything, which allowed them to achieve their current status. The fact that they achieved this through their own efforts is certainly commendable, but the contribution of Yaoqing in guiding them cannot be ignored. Huisheng and Tongshan have the best grasp of Wang's Beijing vernacular. In the amateur circles, Nan Tiesheng (now performing professionally) has learned the superficial aspects, while Zhang Xiaoshan has entered the inner sanctum, and his skill is no less than that of a professional. Among the female performers, Xue Yanqin and Xin Yanqiu have both received personal instruction and have gained something from it. Zhang Eryun has studied with Wang the longest, and her skills far surpass those of ordinary performers. She can be called the number one female Dan. Hua Huilin lacks talent, and Wang Yurong only excels in singing; neither is particularly gifted. As for those below them, there is even less to say.</p>
<h3>A Film Producer Talks About the "Almost" Tendency in the Film Industry</h3>
<p>— Sea Star</p>
<p>I met a film mogul at a banquet and talked about the production direction of domestic films. The mogul spoke freely about his personal views, which could serve as valuable reference for today's filmmakers. He said: "In the past, the literary and art circles had a 'close enough' tendency. Today, the film industry seems to be following suit. All companies are flocking to historical dramas, and their nature is nothing more than two types. One is romance stories about young masters and young ladies, which account for nineteen out of ten films made in the Republic era. The other type depicts tragic historical events, which have good subject matter, but the layout and characters are mostly the same. Some people call it 'silver eight-legged essays,' which doesn't seem like an exaggeration. I believe that whether it's a historical or modern drama, it can be filmed. The form can be flexible, but the theme must be new. The so-called 'new' doesn't mean being unconventional or indulging in fantasy. To live up to its original purpose, a film doesn't necessarily have to depict loyal ministers sacrificing themselves for their country or chaste women dying for their virtue. There are plenty of other good subjects to explore." The "close enough" problem really needs to be examined by today's filmmakers, otherwise, they are bound to get narrower and narrower.</p>
<h3>The Smile of Empress Li Qinian</h3>
<p>— Photographed by Xinggu</p>
<h3>Review of "Li Xiangjun"</h3>
<p>— Jin Ge</p>
<p>Indeed, "Li Xiangjun" is a work worth seeing.</p>
<p>Adapted from the stage to the screen, with the original author serving as the adapter, the plot has not changed much. Therefore, many of the cautionary dialogues in the play are still preserved, and many scenes that could not be performed in the play due to spatial limitations can be fully realized through the unique technology of film.</p>
<p>Director Wu Cun is competent. He handles the lingering affections of the male and female protagonists with his unique style, delicate and vivid. He also uses bold and decisive techniques for several war scenes. It's just that the capturing of the climax is still slightly insufficient.</p>
<p>Mr. Zou Xiao said that the author's description of the characters' psychology in the play is extremely delicate. The director's thorough understanding and self-creation are also very successful in this regard. For example, when General Wang sends bribes, Chaozong's hesitation reveals his wavering will and foreshadows his future surrender. Also, the hedonistic Prince Fu secretly peeks at the script of "The Swallow Note" when he is welcomed into the capital, which shows that he is an incompetent person who does not care about politics. The handling of the scene where Xiangjun faints after hitting the window is inappropriate. Although it is not necessary to call a doctor, Zhen should at least bandage Xiangjun or apply some medicine, otherwise it seems too unreasonable. The arrangement of the camera angles shows great care and also increases its artistic achievement.</p>
<p>Gu Lanjun gives a very good performance. The scene where she throws the bottle and Hou vomits blood and dies tragically is performed very well. However, the expression in her eyes when speaking is sometimes too mechanical. I hope she can pay attention to this. Bai Yun's Hou Chaozong can be said to be largely dutiful, but he is a little too frivolous.</p>
<p>The profound meaning of the script, the excellent directing techniques, the deep acting skills of the actors, and everything else will not disappoint you. This film can be said to be the first ray of light from Golden Star.</p>
<h3>Examination of Kunqu Lyrics</h3>
<p>— Master of the Flute Pavilion</p>
<p>Since the beginning, amateur performers and dramatists have all said that Kunqu scripts are more elegant and refined than Beijing opera. However, few people are inclined to study it. In times of war and chaos, people's hearts are strong and resolute, and culture is declining, making it difficult to understand the profound. The sound of insects heralds the arrival of autumn, and the rumble of thunder brings mountain rain. From this, we know that the way of sound is not unrelated to the fate of the world. I have often dabbled in various romances, such as "Singing Phoenix," "Jingchai," "White Rabbit," and "Loyalty," all of which emphasize loyalty and righteousness. "Pipa" and "Bowing to the Moon" are deeply devoted to filial piety. "Red Pear" and "Jade Hairpin" are refined and elegant. The Four Dreams of Yuming have beautiful words and strict rhythm, and slow and gentle melodies, which can cultivate the mind and should not be regarded as mere expressions of love. I have occasionally selected good lines to share with like-minded people, and I hope that gentlemen in the world will promote them.</p>
<p>(1) "Wandering in the Garden" (Soap Gauze Robe): "Flying in the morning and rolling in the evening, the clouds and mists decorate the emerald pavilion; threads of rain and slices of wind, misty painted boats; the embroidered screen and beautiful people look down upon the fleeting spring." Just imagine Du Liniang entering the garden, seeing this beautiful scene, what kind of feelings are in her heart! The melancholy and shyness of spring are the natural emotions of a young girl, a kind of graceful state that is inadvertently revealed. Liu Mengmei enters the dream by the plum blossoms, and they are tender and affectionate with each other, "provoking bee sorrow and butterfly love, a predestined fate of three lifetimes." It is not necessary to have the event, but it is impossible not to have this music.</p>
<p>(2) "Seeing the Moon" (Spread Gold Character Order): "Dusk is near, the courtyard is filled with faint mist; the clear night is quiet, the sound of the bell drips into the empty quiet; a sorrowful person, who will pity him?" This describes Emperor Tang Minghuang returning to the western capital after the rebellion, looking up at the bright moon, thinking of his beloved concubine, and feeling extremely sad. The word "Huang" (yellow) should be sung with a slight touch of black (乌) and yellow (黄) sound. "Hun" (dusk) should be pronounced as "hu wen qie," and "jin" (near) should be pronounced as "qi yi yin qie." This is a Changsan eye (a musical term), which is extremely pleasant to listen to. It is also a solo performance for a government official, and very few people sing it. I have heard one person sing it in Haining, and only one or two people in Shanghai can sing it. Later, there is a song called "Night Rain Striking the Wutong Tree," which is as mournful as the cuckoo's cry, with a feeling that shakes the Qiong Valley.</p>
<p>(3) "Tragic Sight" (Tipping Cup Jade Hibiscus): "Packing up the great land and rivers in a single load, the four elements are all empty; having experienced the vast journey, the desolate plain; the piled up mountains, the rolling Yangtze River." This is when Yongle usurped the throne, and Emperor Jianwen, together with Cheng Ji, disguised himself as a monk, avoided Xiangyang, and saw countless loyal officials being killed along the way, all of whom were former ministers, and the common people were supporting the old and carrying the young, wandering and displaced. This play is commonly known as "Eight Yang," with eight songs before and after, rhyming with "Yang." In the early Republic era, many people sang it. The meaning of the words is broad-minded, and passed down to this day, it is like an ornament of the times.</p>
<p>(4) "Breaking Willow at Yangguan" (Golden Bell): "How much spring weaving is left? The embroidered battle clothes are personally given to the men." The separation of husband and wife makes people sad! Today's travelers on long journeys should also feel it in their hearts. Seeing the farewell at the barracks in Beijing opera is too much like adding feet to a snake (unnecessary). The emotion in Kunqu is seen in the lyrics, which are gentle and without agitation. The dialogue is also quite fitting. Huo Xiaoyu sends Li Yi to Ba Bridge, and they look at each other across the green willows, so there are the lingering words: "Tell him to not leave his sword wherever he goes through the passes, and ask him to send letters to home when he meets people on the post road." All of this requires careful study of the lyrics. It cannot be understood at a glance, so the music is high and few people can sing along. Common people often cannot understand it and look down on it.</p>
<p>Random Notes from the Pear Garden</p>
<h3>Tao Xiaoting reduced to Beggary</h3>
<p>— Mei Yi</p>
<p>The old Kunqu opera actor Tao Xianting has a son named Xiaoting, who used to fill minor roles in the Rongqing Society Kunqu troupe. Sometimes he played the flute as a guest performer. Although the income was not very good, he was not reduced to beggary. According to a letter from a friend in Tianjin, Tao Xiaoting became addicted to bad habits last year, and later also smoked drugs. Recently, he was suddenly heard to be begging on the streets. Tao's relatives and friends, seeing Xiaoting willingly falling, all turned their noses and passed by, unwilling to offer help. According to reports, it is not uncommon for people in the Pear Garden to beg. There was Zhao Shengbi, a famous martial artist who graduated from Fu Society, who died of a drug overdose last year, and a certain female performer who once enjoyed great fame. Xiaoting is just one of them. The reason for their downfall is all due to drug use. People in the Pear Garden are mostly addicted to bad habits. Should they not be alert after reading this news?</p>

<h3>Examination of Characters in the "Confucius" Film (1)</h3>
<p>— Drawn by Tianye, Written by Qingniao</p>
<p>Preface: During the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, the world was in decline. Although the Zhou Dynasty had the name of the Son of Heaven, it had no real power to rule. The feudal lords divided the world, established their hegemony, fought and killed each other, killed their rulers and fathers. For more than two hundred years, rebellions did not cease. Confucius was born in this era. As a commoner, he traveled everywhere, lecturing on faith and righteousness, verbally criticizing and writing articles. His words and deeds are enough to serve as a model for all generations. Last October, when the sun was bright and the leaves were turning dark, the Shanghai Minhua Film Company specially produced "Confucius," a film about the lifelong struggles of the Sage, directed by Mr. Fei Mu, with a serious and careful attitude. At this time and in this place, this is especially commendable. Before the film is released, this publication will specially introduce the characters in the film, publishing it over six days, and we hope that readers will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Confucius, named Qiu, styled Zhongni, was a native of Lu. He was born in 1462 BC, the twenty-first year of King Ling of Zhou, and died in the forty-first year of King Jing of Zhou, at the age of seventy-three. He was born 551 years earlier than Jesus Christ and six years later than Sakyamuni. The Master "matches virtue with heaven and earth and caps his way with ancient and modern," taking propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and love as the foundation of his life, and rectifying his heart and making his intentions sincere as the beginning of governing his family, ruling his state, and pacifying the world. Where great righteousness lay, he never tired of teaching, struggling all his life, until his death. Later generations respected him and honored him as the national teacher.</p>
