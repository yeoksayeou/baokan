<p>社評</p>
<h3>從工商業當前之處境以策將來</h3>
<p>在此二三月中，上海市塲極盡波譎雲詭，漲跌升降之致。外匯由緊轉長，黃金（每十兩）之價，乃自七千餘元，直落至五千元有零；二十支棉紗，自每包一、千八百餘元，竟小至八百元左右；而隨棉紗以俱小者，尙有其原料棉花，成品棉布。此其所予工商界及一般投機分子之打擊，已極嚴重。並聞紐約股票之一度慘沮，中國巨商損耗於此中者爲數允鉅；上海洋商股票之節節下挫，凡珍視洋股如拱璧者，至此盡傾其所有，尙不足以彌補其所虧之甚。惟獨屹然不移反形高漲者，則爲人生一日所不可缺之米麥麵粉魚肉蔬菜油醬而已。夫以錢之川流不息，來去無定，以勞力血汗所換得之金錢，尙有不能善保始終，何况投機所獲，暴利所得，悖入悖出，古訓昭然，盈虛消息，謂非自然之理乎？故於其成敗得失，雖謂不足道，不足恤可也。所可痛心者，市塲多經一度風波，民間元氣多一番斲喪耳。</p>
<p>推求風波之由來，謂爲白熱之投機所致，事屬誠然；但國際時局與世界經濟之錯雜其間而為之重要因素，是亦不容否定。溯自歐西風雲變色，影響無遠弗屆；上海租界因此謠詠朋興，工商業者因此左右徬徨，於是相率觀望，於是無形壅滯，此則未可盡以歸咎於投機者。及日人乘機向遠東英法屬地施壓迫，法人首先慴服，凡越南及廣州灣毘連內地之處，悉行封鎖，而沿香港一帶中國地段，復爲日軍所佔領，於是西南道路，失其靈敏便利，直接所予滬上工商業以打擊者頗大。同時英法之關係惡化，遠東兩國屬地間之航運，將有中斷之虞，此後對南洋貨運之究將何似，亦爲工商界所絕無把握。至於中國北部之對南中各地商業，原屬一家，今同異族；尤自六月廿六日以還，日人對於華北與他處之滙兌與商貨，縮小範圍，加强統制。其在南中，又對於北運之貨，加以種種抑勒。故今後中國南北淪陷區之商業必因遭受割裂而銳减；取而代之者，厥惟日貨；此又苛細之壓榨政策之必然後果也。</p>
<p>此外尙因物價之不絕抬高，一般購買力無形减削觀於各耒嘗試削價而無補於門庭冷落，可爲之明證；而商家既因積重難返，又因憧憬於去年之暴利，不明時勢之變遷，意圖多囤貨物，弋取厚利，不意適得其反，遭受巨大之損失。又如工業用原料若棉花小麥蠶繭之類，亦無不爲日人用「統制」之名，庫價搜羅，悉數囊括，供其工廠之用，華商工廠雖出高價，不易取得，此其結果，將使華商工廠不出於停業，即出於屈膝，以「合作」之術語，求餘瀝之分潤；吾則，惟有用高貴之外匯，取給原料於海外。，成本既重，安得而與之相競於市塲。另一方面，出口貨大宗如絲茶之類，歐非銷路頓見衰落，產地茶價之下降無論已，蠶繭在出新時，每擔可售二百元左右，今則以絲銷不振，廠絲復以捐稅重重，輸出允多窒碍，浙西方面土絲售七八十元，尙乏受主。米糧之類，專供國內消費，固無虞不給，然於日本以戰養戰之餘，淪陷區之米糧商行輒出兩石之代價，僅得一石之米糧，猶有搬運無着之苦，至不得不仰結於越暹。近則香港寄棧之米，又恐一旦封鎖，不得出運，故洋米到源絡繹不絕；越南之米，又因地中海戰事，向之接濟法義諸國者，今則無從西運；此則似有稍輕上海米糧恐慌之望者，然頗聞日人已作染指壟斷之謀矣，前途未可知也。</p>
<p>凡此所予上海工商業之影響，日就式微而已，日就衰敗而已，業中人應如何及早警惕耶！</p>
<h3>蔣總裁七口全會閉幕詞　以自强不息精神應付國際演變環境　日本所謂東亞門羅主義難自圓其說</h3>

<p>格外激劇　最近日本在太平洋上的言行、亦日益囂張離奇、各位同志此次對於國際問題、更是特別注意、所以趁這閉會時候、再對各位陳述一下、本席以爲國際環境無論怎樣演變、而最重要的問題、還是要我們本身有堅忍不拔、自强不息的精神基礎、本身有了强固的基礎、則國際局勢無論如何變化、於我國只有益處、而決不會有什麼不利的地方、我們革命抗戰的精神、本來就是要矢勤矢勇、貫澈始終、絕對不因國際環境之順利不順利、而受到絲毫的影響、何况現在國際的環境、對於我們實在是特別有利、與我們預期的方針、一步一步的接近、與我們奮鬥的目標、更是日見符合、現在我且舉最近一件事例、對各位同志說明、我所要說的、就是日本在上月底高唱「東亞自主」、以及最近美總統秘書關於</p>
<p>門羅主義的談話、日本爲欲遂行其田中奏摺所謂征服中國、以征服世界的傳統侵略政策、他一貫的慣技、就是利用世界上現成的名詞、作爲掩飾其行爲的辯護狀、自「九一八」以來、日本朝野常常盛唱「東亞人之東亞」的論調、又有所謂「東亞門羅主義」的名詞出現於他們的公私宣傳文字之內、其用意無非在排除歐美免爲其侵略中國、掠奪亞洲的障碍、尤其是針對着提倡「不承認主義」、與「堅持九國公約」的美國、在他的用意來說、美洲有門羅主義、爲什麼東亞不可以由日本來行門羅主義、最近歐洲劇變以後、他在荷印越南南洋等處、肆行威脅、顯露鋒鋩、自上月下旬以來、就大吹大擂說、他的政府、將有關於「東亞門羅主義」重大聲明、最後乃於六月廿九日、在他的圓桌會議以後、由他的外相有田、作非正式的廣播、以東亞主人目居、欲囊括中國與南洋土地、作爲他的視爲「基於共存關係之分野」、儼然自稱爲「東亞安定勢力之日本」、而一面則曰此種思想、在歐美各國亦復存在、我們看他的全文、實在是賈不成理、妄冀搪塞、威嚇世界的耳目、與反對、期使大家所厭聞惡聞之「東亞新秩序」、換一名詞而實現、他全不想想、所謂門羅主義產生的環境如何、時代如何、以及其本質如何、老實說美洲之有鬥羅主義、事在</p>
<p>一百餘年以前、有那時美洲的環境、所以能產生如是之主義、也因爲有美國道樣一個具有領導資格、而願與本洲各國平等互助與和平共存之國家、所以門羅主義纔能推行於久遠、現在是什麼時代、日本是什麽國家、尤其是亞洲現在環境與地理是如何的形勢、無論歷史文化與人口民族各種最重要的因素、他皆一概不顧、以爲門羅主義是隨便可以產生出來的、他不知道美國所以能成就門羅主義的道理、是因爲門羅主義的精神爲美洲各獨立自由國家、在互助自衛上所需要、絕不是武力侵略的結果、何况時至今日、論眞正的世界和平之永奠、已經應該超過了地域的或部分的結合、而擴充爲全世界眞正平等合理之有效的集體安全組織、纔能收效於永久、若就亞洲來說、唯有我文化最悠久、人口最衆多、面積最廣大和亞洲各民族歷史上關係最密切的中國、憑我國固有的道德、和三民主義、纔能够安定亞洲、與各國提携共進、以貢獻於亞洲與世界的和平、日本今天憑</p>
<p>什麽資格　來談一東亞自主」、乃至於「東亞門羅主義」、各位要知道、亞洲和他洲不同、亞洲有本身獨立的文化、又和世界上各國有錯綜密切的地域關係、我們提起亞洲、就不能忘却北部有地跨歐亞兩洲的蘇俄、而且因爲太平洋與印度洋上各地的關係、亞洲不僅是與歐洲有關、而且也是東西兩半球共同有關的地區、現在日本仍儼然以亞洲支配者自居、我今且不說文化道德的基礎、只以武力來說、眞不知道他估計過自身的實力沒有、更不知道他已考憲了事實沒有、他究竟憑着什麼來唱亞洲門羅主義、隨着日本外相廣播而引起一般注意的、就是七月六日美總　秘書歐利的談話、因爲最初電訊所傳、他這個談話中間有「美政府所希望而認爲應當實現者、乃各洲皆採行門羅主義一一句話、所以眼光短淺的日本人、就以爲他的聲明得到了響應、其實照他的原意、乃是「美政府願見歐洲與亞洲、能各採用門羅主義、而此門羅主義之解釋與適用、一如在</p>
<p>美洲所行者、就是說、要以互助自衛平等獨立爲基礎、我們統觀他談話的全文、其主旨是在說明如何處置歐洲戰爭戰敗國、在美洲領土的問題、至對於亞洲問題、他的眞意顯然是反對日本以武力壓迫各國的辦法、反對日本以武力侵估任何地點的行動、特別對於法屬安南、明白指出、「應該由東亞各國用集議協商的方法來解決」、這句話簡單的說、就是他美國絕對反對日本用武力侵略安南的自由、單獨的處分安南、可見他絕沒有承認日本來獨用武力支配安南而決定其命運、我們一般同志、必然知道美國是不能放棄他在遠東傳統政策、和他一貫立塲的、而且祗有加强他的一貫主張的美國、是「九國公約」的發起人、他的遵重各國獨立、和開放遠東門戶一貫的主張、就是他反對武力侵略的日本、反對獨覇壟斷爲日本、反對閉關鬥戶的日本、最主要的原因、美國最近擴充軍備、異常積極、擴軍經費加增了一回又一回、爲什麼要如此接二連三的擴軍不止、當然不僅是爲大西洋、而是顧及太平洋上他的安全保陣、和發言的力量、美國在過去的歷史關係上說、當然他關心歐洲、重於亞洲、但是就他的現實和將來的立國來看、一定是重視亞洲更過於歐洲、（未完待續）</p>

<h3>英外相在上院報吿近東局勢　表明地中海英海權强大　力能履行對協約國諾言</h3>
<p>倫敦　英外相哈立法克斯昨在上院言近東之地位謂、自義國參戰以來、英國從未壓迫埃及使之對義宣戰、惟駐埃英軍應埃政府之請、業已大增、將阻止義國對埃之侵略、英國欲履行其保衛埃及之義務、埃及之獨立與重要利益、已因義國之對英宣戰而受威脅、渠可欣然相吿者、埃及人民深知英埃利益互相維繁不可分離、故對義國之甘言有所疑慮、覺有義國侵犯埃及與蘇丹土地之可能、且義國在里比亞阿爾巴尼亞與阿比西尼亞之行爲、尙未使其忘懷、而全能國之野心勃勃、亦使其不作幻想也、駐開羅之義公使遲遲離境、敵方散佈埃及如放棄其條約義務、則可避免義軍壓境的惡果之說、許多負責埃人以爲在此多事之秋、爲埃及人民利益計、不可不有更堅强之政府、表示其履行條約義務之決心、英政府因負有保衛埃及之責、故亦聲明英國之意見與此適同、巴力斯坦形勢現仍寗靜、除偶有匪亂外、全境尙稱安堵、大批阿刺伯人之釋獄、甚爲人歡迎、各部份人民在義國參戰後、已加强其親英情緒、猶太人固在防務與緊急計畫上與英當局完全合作、而阿刺伯人恐義國所用里比亞殖民化之方法、將來移用於巴力斯坦、故亦予英當局以一致之合作、</p>
<p>英國與土國仍有極密切之維繫、當義國參戰之初、土總理會宣稱土國將維持非交戰國之態度、英政府深了解土政府作此決定之環境、而土政府亦始終與英政府密切接觸、英土條約今仍有效、而此條約所根據之兩國人民間忠實友誼與同情、今仍存在、渠希望此可爲目前戰時與將來和平時兩國間有建設性的合作之基礎、德國雖在巴爾幹與近東、極力從事於引起無根據的疑慮與恐慌之工作、以期諸國墜其狡計、然渠信該處人民頗不乏對於全能國方法具有經騐者、當不致受欺而改變其對於吾人奮鬥以赴的原則之信念、吾人現表示吾人有對於近東與巴爾幹友人予以援助與保護之能力云、（十二日路透電）</p>
<h3>法實行獨裁政制　貝當上將任為元首　行政大權集於一身　政府將遷至凡爾賽</h3>
<p>維希　法國政府昨晚頒佈法令、宣佈貝當上將爲法國最高統帥、授予「法國元首」之尊稱、兼行總統與總理之政權、今後法國政府行政權完全集於貝當上將一身、各部會均對貝當上將負責而直接受其指揮、貝當上將之權限、今可單獨應付國外之緊張局勢、處理國內之嚴重衝突、參衆兩院一俟新憲法正式公佈之後、卽將休會、以後僅元首始可召集兩院開會云、（十二日海通社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　瑞士波洛敏斯德無綫電臺稱、貝當上將頃簽署一令、按照此令而接管前由共和國總統及總理辦理之一切工作、於是從一九三三年起任總統而爲法國首腦之勒白侖、乃被貝當上將免職、貝當總統復簽署一令、規定一國首腦之權力、渠將實施政府全權與各部長及央長合作、（十二日路透社電）</p>
<p>新憲規定元首權限</p>
<p>維希　本日法國政府公報刊載法國新憲法、規定法元首之權限如次、</p>
<p>「第一條」政府之大權完全在法國元首之掌握中、元首派定部長、部長祗有對元首負責、（一）新國會未成立之前、元首執行閣議中之立法權、（二）在參衆兩院成立後、遇有內憂外患、危機四伏之時、元首有頒佈關於財政預算及徵稅等法令之權、（三）元首公佈法規予以施行、（四）元首任命文武官員、（五）元首掌握全國之最高軍權、（六）元首執行特赦權、（七）元首有進行外交談判、核准條約及接見外國使節之權、（八）元首有宣告全國戒嚴、或一部戒嚴之權、（九）元首獲得議會之核准、有宣戰之權、</p>

<p>貝當發表廣播演說　維希　貝當元帥昨夜在無綫電臺向人民演說、暗示政府當前所待理之巨大工作、我人僅須想及法國之難民及給養問題以及其範圍、在法國被迫對德國屈服之黑暗時期中、法國之苦難尙接踵而來、英國海軍已攻擊其從前同盟之法國海軍、無論何種理由、均不能證明此種舉動之合理、英國聲稱爲預防法國艦隊落入德義手中起見、故不得不採取此項策略、法國在此非常大戰已皆失敗、慘遭新創、渠需要全體法國人民之信任、與渠之獲得法人代表之信任正同、渠將祖織一新政府、各省之行政長官應改爲省長、由政府任命之、鑒於各種事工之待理、法國政府決遷往凡爾賽、內閣各部卽遷回巴黎、卽被佔領之境內、現已向德國政府提出此項請求、此次戰爭已使國際資本主義及國際社會主義宣吿崩潰、法國現已脫離各種暗無天日之條約及聯盟關係、且完全孤立、但法國將以勇敢剛毅之精神、獨立改造法國國家及法國之生命、（十二日海通電）</p>
<p>議會制度茍延殘喘</p>

<p>莫斯科　最近外國報紙謠傳蘇聯已向土耳其提出割讓領土之要求、塔斯社頃由官方授權聲明、此項謠言純屬揑造、完全與事實不符、（十二日塔斯電）</p>

<p>聞賽丹之言論、將以强有力之詞句出之、而似將引起國外深刻之印象、至於蘇聯正式吾認德國所傳蘇聯以哀的美敦書致土政府之舉、已使土國爲之滿意、英外相哈立法克斯星期三夜在上院述及英土關係之言論、亦受此間誠摯之歡迎、駐土德大使巴本已返抵安加拉與政治發展維持接觸、土國現對於德國外交界之陰謀、不勝憤懣、若輩在已往一週中傳播種種讕言、如蘇聯將向土耳其提出要求、英土條約將正式廢止、土耳其將請德國保護、將以斯丹埠割予蘇聯之類、此種讕言已引起土國各報之痛詆、而政界亦爲忿忿、今日蘇聯之吾認與總理賽丹之演說、似可使一般人士甚至使德國外交家了然於德國對土恫嚇、或毒化蘇土關係之努力已遭失敗、（十二日路透社電）</p>

<h3>蘇彜士運河脆弱性</h3>
<p>歐戰爆發前，不問在日間和夜間，夏天和冬天，每八十二分鐘內，都有一隻船，以可驚的速度，開往某一地點，在蘇彝士運河進出口處，放着汽笛。航船的時間最寳貴，因此，它不能停頓。船舶利用蘇彜士運河，就在節省時間，而時間的延誤，就將失去蘇彝士運河存在的價値。一百二十個會各種言語的領港隨時聽候調度</p>
<p>蘇彝士運河公司對於每一個到來的船，皆負安全之責，如果在黑夜，則裝置探照燈，並派舵工及大副上船指揮，正如一個有訓練的看護授一個奶瓶與嬰孩一樣。</p>
<p>全河共有彎曲十三處，若有一隻船偶一不愼，撞入一個彎曲處，那就好像一個瓶塞，塞入瓶口，全河通航要停滯一星期。然而年復一年，沒有發生過這種情事，足證組織的完善了。</p>
<p>公司所管轄的水道，長一百十四英里。從賽特港到蘇彝士只有一百零六英里，但由於海濱的淺仄，地中海方面須加疏濬的水道有六英里，江海方面有二英里。以前法國人雷賽所開掘的一錢是平原與沙地，沒有發生行麼工程上的問題。全綫利用了三處天然低窪之地，一爲亡沙勤湖，）二十七英里），一爲鐵海沙湖（七英里），及其他兩個鹹水湖（二十英里　。另一段爲德密達運河，一半的工程是開濬成功的。沿河並無岩石層，地中海水面比江海水面只低十英寸，而兩處實際上並無潮汐。尼羅河的分出淡水運河，流入鐵姆沙湖，因此有三種不同的水混入蘇彜士主渠內。</p>
<p>蘇彝士運河管理委員會的主要工程是疏濬尼羅河排洩出來集積於其三角洲的沉澱物。埃及的河流正如中國的黃河和美國的密西西必河一樣，可以稱爲泥沙很多的河流。尼羅河口的往密達，只距運河西口二十五英里，地中海方面通常的風向是由西北吹來，地中海南岸全部的海流也是自西到東，河中的泥沙沿海岸造成淺灘，壅塞了蘇彝士運河口。</p>
<p>爲維持水深三十七英尺的標準，蘇彝士運河公司採用了兩項工程計劃，一項是築堤，把含有沉澱的海流不使之近岸，一項是不斷疏濬水道，保持水的深度。該項堤岸從賽特港起，向外傾斜開展，有三英里是突出水面，還有兩英里是低於水面。</p>
<p>在最初掘河的時候，河底的寬六十五英尺，但由於時勢的變遷，雷　特時代以木製成的帆船，現已由體積更大的鐵製輪船代替了。因此，蘇彜士運河公司不能不與現代造船工程的進步而俱進。目前河底的廣闊，已達一百八十英尺，而河面的廣闊，已達四百五十英尺。八十五英盡闊船舷的大船兩條在一起，能够穩便通過，但預防不測起見，曾嚴格規定，一條船必須停止進行，另一條船則須每小時减低五英里速度。原來二十五英尺的深度，也增加至三十七英尺。</p>
<p>船隻進行愈快，阻碍愈大，所激起的浪花也愈厲害。如果一隻船以其通常速度進行，其激起的浪花先將損毀兩旁的堤岸。蘇彜士運河公司乃規則限定吃水三十英尺的船舶，母小時以九英里的速度進行。</p>
<p>大船的舵相當的小，因可在廣闊海洋中進行時，獲得轉側角度極大的自由，在狹隘的水道中，角度極大的轉側，極為不便。一小時九英里的速率失云了駕駛自由，更使其不能轉側。因此把華麗的大輪安全地領導至廣闊的海洋上，實是蘇彝士運河釦港者技術優良的一個證明。</p>
<p>雖則蘇彝士運河公司純粹是商業性質的事業，但其商業的容量却視外界政治而轉移。外界的事件，如一國政府當局送達一個照會給另一國政府，會使蘇彜士運河的股票跌價。長期股票的低落要算一八七二年，那時此項事業能否成功，一般人仍抱懷疑態度。股票長期的高漲，要算一九三七年，那是隨着一九三六年英埃締結條約而來，股東自每股五十美元漲至一千二百美元。在一九三五年，義大利征阿比西尼亞時，國聯實行制裁，英國議員在議會中要求封鎖蘇彜士運河，股票跌至五百美元。蘇彜士運河股票的價格差不多可成為政治風潮的測騐器。</p>
<p>蘇彜士運河公司的終止期是在一九六八年的十一月，那時運河地帶土地的租借滿期。這樣一來，永遠的改良不便舉行，因為過了二十八年，他們或將得不償失。也就因為未來或將得不償失。也就因爲未來不知如何，對於現在保持運河的工程，也發生了若干困難。</p>
<p>在租期滿後，該運河就將無條件歸還埃及王法魯或其繼承人。到了一九六八年十一月，埃及政府對於下列三種辦法，可任擇其一：（一）以相當代價，購買公司生財，將這事業收爲埃及政府所有。埃及早有學生及智識階級激昂慷慨，喊出「排除一切外人及外人資本」的口號，把該運河收歸埃及人管理。（二）埃及政府或以之另行租給一家新公司，這新公司或由日本德國及義大利爲其主要分子。在這樣情形之下，埃及政府可獲大宗租金。（三）埃及政府仍租給原來的公司，將租期延長，將租金增加，或盈利增多，與董事會的代表增加。</p>
<p>就一般人觀測，如果現公司的董事長福格卽不與埃及王事前獲得秘密協定，也必使第三個選擇，能够達到目的。如以金錢的多少為轉移，則自無其他團體有這種雄厚力量，該公司技術上服務的優良及金錢勢力的雄厚，對於其握有優先權，自可操勝算。此外，若干人相信，英國亦必用極大的壓力加諸訂約一方，以求成立新約。租讓權雖仍有二十八年可享，但謠言已極盛，謂已有若干國家允許大量金錢，作收買活動了。</p>

<h3>英美蘇合作為安定遠東因素　美外交會主張美蘇全合作　伍德海建議美海軍東來</h3>
<p>最近太平洋形勢、突然緊張、英美日蘇之錯綜關係、表示日益微妙、英國當局毅然拒絕日方對於封鎖滇緬公路之要求、幷實行撤退香港婦孺準備以武力抵抗外來侵略、英日之關係緊張，概可想見、同時七七事變、日美海軍陸戰隊在防區內拘捕日便衣武裝憲兵十六名之事件發生後、日方故意擴大該事變之嚴重性、幷在虹口區發起反美運動、四處遍貼標語及開會、主張以武力對付美國、美日關係、雖不致因此地方事件而趨破裂、惟雙方交惡、實所難免、</p>
<p>美蘇全作可望實現</p>
<p>故最近美國外交政策協會、鑒於日本侵略之威脅、不容忽視、竟建力、某外報曾於社評稱、該項建議、殊有實現可能、</p>
<p>伍德海氏有效建議</p>
<p>據著名英籍評論家伍德海意見、美國海軍駐留檀香山之舉動、當可表示美國決意不肯放棄東亞之權益、彼復提及香港當局所採取之預防措施、表示日本襲擊香港之可能性、並闡明英當局準備抵抗之決心、最後彼建議美英當局大可成立協定、移調一部分美海軍於星加坡、亦爲制止日人南進之辦法、美國此舉、純粹在維護權益、及保持太平洋現狀、日方不得藉詞反對、</p>
<p>蘇聯政策始終不變</p>
<p>上述兩方面見解之對象、均集中於制止日人擴張之野心、太平洋情形向此方面發展、顯然對中國之抗戰、絕對有利、記者復向本埠接近蘇聯外交界人士叩詢蘇聯對於中國抗戰之態度、承答稱、蘇聯對華政策、一向不變、如人民外交委員會委員長莫洛托夫所言、蘇聯民衆、一致同情中國英勇之抗戰、中國繼續抗戰、必能獲得最後勝利、</p>
<p>滇緬禁運於法未合</p>
<p>昨日字林西報刋有讀者來函稱、日本政府與其國內報紙、對英政府拒絕其滇緬路禁運之要求、大表不滿、但在另一方面、吾人僅須細察日方行駛於其「佔領區」之船隻、卽可知若干戰事必需品、均由日方自西伯利亞源源運往德國、迄今未止、據吾人所知、英政府並未因此而向日方提出抗議、因後者究係中立國、其運輸上旣未受英國之監視、自不能禁止其爲此也、根據同樣情形、英國以同等之地位、自可由滇緬運軍火接濟中國、何况日本並未正式向中國宣戰乎、日方對華宜戰後、或可使用其海軍力量、扣留艦隻、今日方此種措置、自屬非法之舉也、</p>
<h3>明日為法國國慶　因時局關係　不過事鋪張</h3>
<p>明日爲法國巴黎革命羣衆、攻毀巴士蒂爾大獄、造成法蘭西共和國慶一百五十一週紀念日、旅滬法國僑民、往年循例舉行慶賀儀式、當局於每年七月十四日、作盛大之歡宴大會、卽各捕房與法租界、救火會、大門首掛電炬燈彩、點綴國慶、本年因</p>
<p>時局關係不欲過事鋪張、新聲社記者向關係方面探悉、明日除懸旗誌慶外、不作任何行動、下午七時或假法商俱樂部舉行餐叙、共伸慶賀、屆時法大使戈斯默夫婦·法總領事歐仁等，均將出席、大使海格私邸或將招待僚屬、各旅滬法僑之親友間、將自行</p>
<p>宴會在祝以誌紀念先烈造之非易、按距今一百五十一年前之一七八九年七月十四日、法京巴黎革命羣衆、攻陷巴士蒂爾大獄、造成共和國慶、樹立默陸民主主義模範先進國家、其時雖有頓挫、終賴不屈不撓精神推翻王權、造成今日之國慶、</p>
<h3>盛京輪所裝軍火日方宣稱收買　駐滬法軍方面尙無表示</h3>
<p>太古盛京輪、由天津裝來之法軍軍火、已於前日日方自動派駁船運去、外傳被沒收之說茲據日方宣稱、該項軍火已被收買、但駐滬法軍尙無表示、故日法雙方如何交涉、無從探悉、盛京輪於軍火卸畢後、卽駛進淞口、停靠法租界外灘該行一號碼頭、起卸來貨、聞來貨甚多、原定今日出口赴津、因不及裝卸、現改明日（星期日）上午十時啟程、但據日海軍發言人昨晚在招待新聞記者席上宣稱、星期二（九日）由盛京輪上卸下之軍火、暫時仍將由日軍保存之、該發言人繼稱、關於該輪不聽停駛號令、而向英海軍當局提出之抗議、目下仍由雙方當局在和平討論中、</p>
<h3>日憲兵被捕事件尋求解決塗徑　日軍官兩次訪貝克上校　對此事作更詳盡之解釋</h3>
<p>關於七七抗建三週紀念日日憲兵十六人、在美軍防區被捕一案、日方報紙及僑民、大事鋪張、日本官方之態度、則已漸趨緩和、美軍當局以咎不在我、始終出之淡漠與冷靜、問題雖未解決、緊張之勢、實已漸弛、貝克上校答覆日憲兵部一函、已於十日送達日方、但晶方認爲此項答覆、類多「答非所問」故有向美海軍第四聯隊詳細解釋之必要、</p>
<p>路透社十二日東京電、日外務省發言人、今日招待外報記者時、再度表示希望上海美陸戰隊與日憲兵之意外事件、將可就地解決、謂此事已任上海日當局談判、</p>
<p>兩訪貝克詳細解釋</p>
<p>爰於星期四（十一日）特派日軍官二名、往訪貝克上校、說明當時出事之實際情形、但貝克上校以忙於公務、軍草接見、竟未予作長時間談話之機會、啟昨日午前、日軍官等乃再度往訪赫德路美海軍第四聯隊司令部、向美方某職員作詳細之解釋、該職員允將詳情轉達貝克上校、</p>
<p>日文報紙張大其詞</p>
<p>據昨日日軍發言人在招待西報記者席上宣稱、關於出事當時實際詳細之情形、實非外間所盡知、渠對此事、亦不欲多所批評、昨日之日文大陸新報、對此案又以廣大之篇幅、發表「宏論、」略稱、此一事件、不獨影響「皇軍」之威信、且影響於日本整個國家之榮譽與尊嚴、此一問題、苟不獲適當而迅速之解決、其影響於日本國內之政治情形及對外關係、必甚嚴重、因此事之發生地、乃國際觀瞻所繫之上海一埠也、</p>
<p>官方態度表示審愼</p>
<p>據稱、我國（本日）當局、憑其全體在滬日僑之擁助、尙在採取謹愼之態度、以冀美海軍對於本案作適當之處置、但我國（日本）當局之審愼、應有限度、故美海軍對於憲兵隊司令三浦之抗議、若遲遲不覆、則我國當局必須採取其最後之決定、此蓋當然之事也、</p>
<p>東京言論推波助瀾</p>
<p>美國合衆社東京十二日電、東東「日日新聞」今日要求日本政府採取「以牙還牙、以刀還刀、」政策、解決在滬美國海軍陸戰隊與日本憲兵間發生之事件、該報聲稱、採取該項政策、不僅能阻止同樣事件之發生、且可處置糾紛、該報指出上海事件最有意義要素二點、其一爲該事件發生於日本旗占有優勢之上海、其二爲此事發生因未開化之美國海軍陸戰隊、託庇於公共租界、」</p>
<h3>日挪用海關稅收達二萬萬之鉅　英國負有追償鉅款責任</h3>
<p>國各關之巨擘、自中日戰事發生以後、奸商漏稅、劣貨充斥、稅收未免較前激减、但每月收入、猶有八百萬元至一千二三百萬元、故江海關每日平均稅收、約達一千萬元左右、自英日海關協定之後、表面雖解存麥加利銀行、實則無異解存日商正金銀行、茲據平明社記者向可恃方面探悉、江海關每日稅牧、由正金銀行收提及以前轉存者、迄今估計至少累積達二萬萬元以上、其中頗多為日方在本埠黑市作套購外滙之用、惟英日海關協定中規定、此項關稅、幷未可供日方挪用將來如有虧負等情、英國麥加利銀行方面殊應負追償此項鉅額稅收之責、故英方至少應向正金銀行查察此款、幷阻止其續被挪用、因此項鉅款、江海關自有確切之帳冊可稽、將來殊應淸算繳回原所有人也、</p>
<h3>華僑貢獻抗戰最力匯歸鉅大款項　捐款六億購公債十一億　政府國際收支賴以平衡</h3>
<p>自沿海富庶各省相繼淪陷、華僑匯款一已爲國府抗戰財政之一大助力、據法文政聞報載稱、根據華僑報吿、自中日事變迄今、華僑匯款回國資助抗戰之款項、達六萬萬元、認購公債達十一萬萬元、日本時報對此、亦有詳細之紀載、據云、在平時</p>
<p>華僑滙款回國、年約三萬萬元、大部由南洋華僑匯來、為平衡中國國際貿易之主要因素、中國在海外僑民的一千萬人、因受外國當局苛遇之痛苦、故愛國情緒、特別濃厚、每當祖國遭受內憂外患、輒以生命財產、供獻國家、不稍　躇、孫中出</p>
<p>革命成功華僑在精神上特力上、幫助極大、自國民黨執政以後、華僑之援助、從未减低、中國政府歷决之戡定內亂、得力於華僑之援助最大、自中日事變以後、華僑援助蔣委員長抗戰之款項、確數雖不可知、但據發表者、有下列各處之捐款、</p>
<p>荷印華僑捐法幣五·〇七三·四一八元、港幣二一九·五六八元、英屬婆羅洲華僑捐港幣八九七·八九六元、自一九三七年七月至一九四〇年三月、華僑捐款總數達六萬萬元、經僑務委員會匯解者、約六千八百五十萬元、</p>
<p>捐款最多者爲新如坡及荷印之僑民、國民政府統治下之二十四省分、已失去十一省、而財政仍能支持者、華僑之援助爲主要原因、至華僑承銷政府公債之數額、尤爲不可忽視、約達一·一一六·一八八·四五一元之多、</p>

<h3>大量印花到滬後應恢復貼用</h3>
<p>上月二十六日國民政府印花稅票大量裝運抵滬後、各業均紛紛購貼、且有多數熱心人士、對於不貼印花之單據、拒絕接受、以重國稅、茲悉尙有少數商戶、仍以「郵局停售無從購貼」爲由、藉以逃避國稅、現有關當局業已派員分赴各商號切實調査、舉凡賬簿銀摺等應貼印花之單據簿冊、若有漏貼情事、卽呈報特區地方法院、依法予以處罰、當局並盼各顧客商民、對於逃貼印花者、盡量吿發云、又悉近來有僞印花票發現、驟視之正難辨明、故各業如爲愼重計、逕向北四川路郵政管理局印花代售　購貨、可不致受愚、</p>

<h3>新亞酒店服毒案　三角變愛眞相　猶籍梅右夫婦潑水重收　俄人戀姦其婦各人不反對　侵占公款發覺三人服毒</h3>

<p>不治身死、其夫人及卡資則仍昏迷不醒、生死莫決、據警務處探員查悉、梅右夫婦約一年前避居來滬、旋卽離異，卡資爲舟山路三九四號捷克商西巴麵包廠雇員、約兩月前、偶遇梅夫人、一往情深、遂不時過訪、冒充該廠廠主、舉止闊綽、以博梅夫人歡心、惟梅夫人與卡資交遊不久、復與其夫</p>
<p>隨歡重拾、而梅右對其妻與卡資在往來、亦不反對、相安無事、奈好景不常、卡資恣意揮霍、月薪不敷抵償、竟私改賬目、以圖掩飾、終被該廠廠主史屆拉卡蒂發覺、報吿法租界警務處、蓋卡資寓辣斐德路也、卡資旣得風聲、不敢入廠工作、星期一日邀梅右夫婦赴新亞飯店闢窒、自認</p>

<h3>代客贖當判處拘役　工部局嚴予取締</h3>
<p>近年以來、滬上發現一種新興事業、卽所謂代客贖當、風行一時、各馬路里弄口、均可見此種店舖、該項店舖之營業範圍、係專收當票、因當舖於收當典質物時、均减低質物之價値甚巨、該店等乃於收買當票時、除去所當之價金外、再酌給客戶以少許金錢、取得當票所有權、備款向當舖將物贖出、然後再行出售、經此一轉手間、</p>
<p>代客贖當之店舖、獲利甚巨、實亦一種剝削貧民之事業、而工部局當局、以此項事業之存在、不特剝削貧民、抑且因當票之轉輾、而使捕房辦案上發生重大困難、因一般竊賊盜匪、於偷刦所得典質後、卽將當票售與此輩、而捕房之破獲竊盜案件、往往得錢索於當票、今眞主旣失、破案亦感困難、於是下令取締、通令所有界內代客贖當店號、一律須於本年五月底全所停閉、否則</p>

<h3>糧食洋米又到一萬餘包　米價復瀉二三元</h3>
<p>連日下游之米市、昨日大批途貨洋米繼續湧到、於是人心更虛、洋米各價再度暴瀉二三元、作客見到貨擁擠、市面日小一日、除本街店舖一些添辦外、其他去路悉告停頓、愈甩愈烈結果成交、雖似稍多、但洋米各價已較前市又落二三元、計收盤一號陳西貢祇六十元零五角、六十元、二號五十七元半、五十七元、一號暹邏六十元、二號五十七元半、五十七元、火絞五十九元、五十八元半、香港尖五十六元半、五十六元二角、東京砶尖五十四元半、五十三元、碎尖特自四十五元、决之四十元、米茶四十七八元、獨小絞以去路最熱、雖貶不足、殊比他貨佔鮮、仍須五十八元半耳、惟期洋米則以浮多巳漸澄淸、市勢轉機、且轉口幫略有添辦、結果比上日反昂半元之譜、統市成交四百多噸、計開英華司卽交暹邏二號米價爲七十元、又六月二十日裝價爲六十八元五角至八角、又二十六日裝六十八元至六十八元六角半</p>
<p>粳糯國米到貨依然寥落、銷塲方面際此疲局、無論明黑市悉屬衰退、所以售價相隨洋米續落一二元、傳聞常幫特淸粳已僅七十元、蘇崑常州白粳六十七八元、决下宿六十四五元、靑泗薄稻六十八九元、南港早稻六十五六元、斛見六十三元左右、糯米金溧貨六十四五元、常丹貨六十二三元、香港白元六十五元云云、</p>
<p>洋米到滬湧旺、前日一日共有六輪到滬、除太古公司成都輪因到埠時晚、確數未詳、其五輪共計裝來七萬七千餘包、已誌昨報、現悉成都輪計裝一萬四千七百零二包、停靠浦東本行碼頭起卸、</p>
<h3>鳳凰牌粉貶價</h3>
<p>麵粉頗形軟化、蓋自華粉廠减省供給後、日廠粉與內地雜牌粉、趁機傾銷、來源不絕、更有洋粉之成交、人心莫不虛萎、昨以米價銳落、購方一味殺價、聞日廠粉鳳鳳牌、跌勢更烈、七月份價祇十五元四角、八月份十五元七角半、九月份十六元、其他內地粉亦均跌一二角不等、至華粉廠盤則仍爲十五元二角、由阜豐廠供給三四千包、</p>
<p>新麥市况、亦屬步鬆、査內均在虹口交卸、大都被日廠收均在虹口交卸、大都被日廠收去、扯價每百斤二十三元左右、華廠方面迄無大量可收、故市塲亦正式開做、聞福新及阜豐購定澳洲洋麥、其第一批、約在本月底可到滬、</p>
<h3>金融出口商塞出外匯　匯市復穩</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、上午九時半揭曉、英匯三辦士七五不更、美匯掛縮一八七五、爲五兀六八七五、其他荷呂日匯亦一致掛緊不等、至內盤情况、本日忽又回頭、雖初時因洋有尙有結款、而一度吿緊、但不久因匯豐拋出遠期美金、並出口商塞出現貨、投機商轉入爲出、致全日市勢、處於鬆動之中、美匯最長到五元九六八七五、後市成交頗稀、故乏上落、先微硬而後回至原價、結果較隔昨英金軋鬆〇六二五、美匯毫無榮辱、計英金三辦士九〇六二五、美匯五元九三七五、論期貨與現貨走勢均相彷彿、</p>
<p>匯豐出遠期美匯</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠均跌一二五、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美不動、對滬縮〇三一二五、對法無市、美對英小七分半、對滬降一角八分、對法無市、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士八七五、美匯五元九〇六二五、較之上日晚收、英硬〇三一二五、美則緊〇六二五、乃匯兌跌落之故、開後洋行及投機商仍有需求、先後入市扒進七月期美匯軟達五元八七五、故現美匯已做五元八四三七五、匯豐掛牌揭曉、英匯未更、美匯掛縮一八七五、爲五元六八七五、他如荷呂日匯亦告掛小、白銀平衡稅揭曉低百分之〇·七五、此後投機商雖續來購納、而匯豐等供意頗佳、又出口商曾拋出七月期美匯、於是市面轉定、八月份匯豐出投機商五元八七五、七月份美匯出口商賣予外行及美行五元九〇六二五至九三七五、迨近午刻、投機家亦反進爲出、價愈硬化、七月份投機家售予外行均爲五元九三七五、八月份成交五元八七五與九〇六二五、時現美匯巳回達五元九六八七五、至午收結果、英金三辦士八七五、美匯五元九三七五、較晨開英平、美長〇一二五、</p>
<p>復後賣戶又轉稀</p>
<p>午後市面平庸、交易亦甚寥落、計僅美行曾售予揣機商理美匯為五元九六八七五、價似硬化、惟迄收盤時止、並無賣戶跟售、市象仍回軟至五元九三七五、晚收價英金較午收爲硬、計英金三辦士九〇六二五、美匯五元九三七五、八月份英金三辦士八七五、美匯五元八七五、比隔昨晚收、現貨英長〇六二五、美無榮辱、八月份英鬆〇六二五、美長〇三一二五、</p>
<p>香港美滙動盪甚</p>
<p>香港十二日（週　五）電、今里匯市開盤吿平、惟美匯動盪殊甚、英匯現貨不動、仍站原盤、遠期未曾開出、美匯現貨緊三七五、爲二十二元七五、（昨收爲二十三元一二五）、申匯現貨升一元、爲三百八十五元（昨收爲三百八十四元）、日匯現貨緊一元半、爲九十七元、九時四十五分申匯現貨回降三元、爲三百八十二元、下午二時三十分開盤吿平、美匯現貨回鬆一八七五、爲二十二元九三七五、其餘均無榮辱、</p>
<p>天津英美同見緊</p>
<p>天津十二日（週五）電、今晨匯市開盤吿平、英匯現貨緊〇九三七五、爲三辦士五六二五、美匯現貨縮一二五、爲五元半、申匯降半元、爲一百〇八元、「聯鈔」暗盤賤二元二角半、爲九十四元二角半、</p>
<h3>新空復起金市回挫</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、經二日來之上漲、驟又回挫、出乎過去獲利經營者之逆料、原以市面起伏不穩、已使一般人懷俱戒心、故本日五千五百三十元開盤後、雖於金銀號兩帮購買下、再晋達五千五百六十元高價、但此後各帮多方猛烈出籠、浮多亦作了結、且不乏新戶拋空、並聞匯市亦吿鬆硬、致釀成巨大賣風、霎時如釜底抽薪、卽告撳落二百元光景、最低見五千三百六十五元、午收尙穩、爲五千四百元、後市走勢平平、初開五千三百九十元、一度又撳十元、嗣賴錢兌業收入、會好至五千四百二十五元、結果卒以五千四百十五元收盤、較上日軋落七十五元、全天約三千兩成交、銀樓飾金結果未動、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤跌七十五元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以匯兌報跌、美匯吿緊、且隔昨人心本佳、致開時買氣濃厚、一抬卽跳四十元、銀號進金號三十兩、爲五千五百三十元、嗣錢兌業及金銀兩帮扒進、續好三十元、銀號出錢兌業二十兩、升爲五千五百六十元、奈斯時外匯忽吿轉鬆、銀號與金號反進爲出、且錢兌業多頭出籠、一部份經營者聞匯豐塞出鉅額英美兩匯、遂向金市拋空、是以賣風漸漸擴大、價遂愈做愈小、迨十一時後竟破入五千四百元大關、銀號互做二十兩、遜爲五千三百六十五元、此後賣風稍戢、某金號及銀號乘低補空、迨午收回高、銀號進金號二十兩、爲五千四百元、作午收價、午後市况轉靜、開市稍挫、銀號對做十兩、爲五千三百九十元、繼因金號吐出、再小十元、金號出銀號十兩、退爲五千三百八十元、旋賴某銀號及錢兌業先後收吸、市勢遂轉、金號出銀樓帮錢兌業等共三十兩、高爲五千四百二十五元、入後金號續來吐塞、重小十元、銀號對做十兩、爲五千四百十五元、作晚收價、結果比上日軋跌七十五元、全天一百九十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金結果無上落</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸五百六十元、迨九時半掛大十元、十時一刻回落十元、十一時十五分反跌十元、午後三時回高十元、結果平平、大同行依然懸五百六十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低三十元光景</p>
<h3>美金票　獲利了結</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤漲後轉跌、英美金鎊趨勢相同、卒吿下落二元半、英金票午後需要殷切、價漲三角、美金票初承隔咋之緊勢、上午九點半漲到十七元一角二分、嗣因獲利奢紛爭傾脫、一度退至十六元六角二分、、卒爲十六元六角八分、比上日尙軋跌一角二分、香港票趨勢堅挺、價漲二分、日金票需要激减、市價步落、晚市退爲一元一角九分半、朝鮮票稍有供給、晚市爲九角八分、一</p>
<h3>雜項香烟暗盤上漲</h3>
<p>近日香烟暗盤趨漲、因市上囤貨稀少、盛傳頣中烟廠有改組訊、霎時買氣頗濃、大英牌較上週漲七十元、五華牌比行盤超出三十餘元、昨開大英牌九百六十八元、品海牌六百四十七元、老刀牌七百六十元、五華牌五百〇三元、人心恐慌、勢乃高翔、（增）</p>
<h3>證券　外股繼續挺秀　—兩橡皮股派息—</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨市更見混沌、交易亦更减少、人心對此犬都不感興趣、市塲集會人數、愈見稀少、益使人恍惚不安、故盤旋呆滯局面、一時殊不易展開也、昨日交易、大都檯面少數零星散戶了結交易而已、絕少新戶或大戶加入、市况已漸漸失去投機性、一日結果稍稍回好一角左右、成交總數共計約三十萬元左右、茲錄簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、或交商務印書館股五十股、價為七十元正、</p>
<p>衆業公所昨雖爲星期五、未見有任何週末了結現象、市况繼續挺秀、上漲更形有力、近收盤時、買方行動、分外良好、此可顯示目下市塲銀根之充裕、投機家與投資者對於未來展望具有信心、橡皮股之未來股息、敢說其必將合乎一般人理想中之美滿、取價上騰不已、不能謂無理由、實業股上漲亦劇、惟其活躍力視橡皮股略差、以週末消息無甚特殊變化、下星期市况繼續看高、</p>
<p>英商匯通洋行經理之楂華康沙及英達區兩橡樹有限公司、昨經通吿分派一九四〇年份中期股息、計楂華康沙每股派給國幣二角半、自七月三十日起派、英達區每股派國幣一元五角、自八月六日起派、</p>
<p>倫敦十一日（週四）電今日中國外債曁遠東英商遠東各公司股票掛牌行市概吿平定、行情均無榮辱、（按昨前兩日僅匯豐銀行股稍見疲落、計九日香港註冊股跌一鎊、爲六十五鎊、十日英倫註冊股跌一鎊、爲六十四鎊、）</p>
<h3>紗花　棉紗大戶　逢高仍有賣出</h3>
<p>紗市始漲繼回、結果平平、實則連漲數日、同時香港幫辦云之現紗、額量已鉅、納冒暫有飽滿之象、所以本日購買大爲减色、惟同行中心思大都看好、但某大戶逢高稍有賣出傾向、總之紗價在百元以內伸縮也、</p>
<p>現紗初開承上日人氣、多方乘勢猛抬、形勢又帶洶洶之象、二十支雙馬開價爲一千〇四十五元、漲三十餘元、少頃漲至一千〇六十四元、此高價一開、賣風驟起、因獲利多頭乘機出籠、於是檯面一鬆、市盤乃步步下降至一千〇十三元、在低峰時盤旋已久、又回復漲至一千〇二十元、收價爲一千〇十七元、查半日間成交統計一千四百二十七包、行情二十支雙馬漲三元、今日有出口紗一百件運海口、又六百五十件運香港、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>同行、一三〇　寗波七七　香港　一六〇　內地　六〇　統計一、四二七</p>
<h3>廠胃難暢　棉市淸靜</h3>
<p>前日異常熱鬧之現棉情形、昨則又忽然冰釋矣、此則各方手貨囤足、市面一好、大家頗有脫卸之意、至於廠方亦無十分暢健胃口、因之生意又入淸靜之途耳、</p>
<p>美棉打包二〇三·〇〇　同行進六三件</p>
<p>上日未及記載之行市補左</p>
<p>通打包一九五·〇〇　內外進五〇〇件</p>
<p>北市　一五一·〇〇　豐記進五〇〇包</p>
<p>大中集二〇一·〇〇　同行進一〇〇包</p>
<p>惠司登　二一〇八·〇〇　同興進二〇〇件</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、昨日晨初開盤殊見活躍、賣後又因華爾街之在市購買後、一部份之空頭抵補、結果收盤價格、較之上日近期跌二三磅音、遠期漲五六磅音、印度棉市頗爲堅定、昨日連同預測又漲二羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來已走入熱鬧之境、交易殊稱不惡、有千餘包之成交、但以日廠購買者居多、紗價之穩定、華廠亦頗有購意、但終以銀根頗緊、不若日廠之放銀期交易、故成交者較少、目前棉花存底已見大减、且一部份之浮多、俱已斬售幾盡、且印棉運輸困難、故今後之棉市、已入正當之途、同業之心意頗爲旺盛也、</p>
<h3>煤炭印煤湧到</h3>
<p>以度喀爾喀答烟煤、自入夏以來、銷塲淸淡、本已落令、惟來源頻仍、價益不支、日前某號到有塊屑定貨一萬餘噸、在碼頭排車、業已起卸完畢、計開門莊發客、塊煤每噸兩百五十元、煤屑兩百三十元、同行自車、酌减廿元盤子、</p>
<h3>油餅　豆餅一落千丈</h3>
<p>豆餅市塲、自得雨後、人心一度奮發、市價因之陡升、但爲時不久、天時又無雨意、一般投機餅商、大受打擊、市况日非、行情一瀉千里、昨市又驟跌六角外、比頂峯時售價（四日）足削二元有奇、昨祗由內地行囤等了結甡記餅四千片、價自十一元三角至十一元、大有四牌餅七百片、價爲十二元八角至六角、元隆餅一車、價爲十一元、肥字餅一車、十一元一角、靑中餅一千穴百片、十一元至十元零四角、十三日有豆六百三十五包、芝蔴六百包、運往香港、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布囤風復熾</h3>
<p>國布　布市晨開續見昂騰、乃因囤風重熾、同業增厚存底、買氣甚濃、而廠方開售件額不多、市面頗呈緊俏、有步售步漲之勢、售盤白貨怡和粗布突漲每疋五角至一元、綸昌廠花布等貨漲每疋一元至一元半、各華廠細布斜紋·粗布亦提升每疋五角之譜、本街成交白貨五百餘件、漂染布二百餘件、溫甬幫辦去近三百件、港幫辦細斜二千餘疋、</p>
<p>東布　晨市因紗價續升、業外囤戶進胃突旺、漲風甚烈、十二磅龍頭細布售開卅一元七八角、四君子嗶嘰每碼到九角三分半、但不久卽以同業拋賣、細布降至卅元〇四角、後市最小盤跌至廿九元五角、終因挫勢過猛、同業抵補回升至卅元〇五角收盤、嗶嘰八角九分、實銷方面、津幫辦細布二百餘件、嗶嘰五十餘箱、而散戶購囤及同業心思交易、粽計成交各貨在千件左右、故市價雖較前日盤小、形勢則漸見穩定、</p>
<p>出口　今日有疋頭七十件運香港、又九十件運海口、</p>

<p>繩妓演藝（二）</p>
<p>人立馬背上，馬去如矢，而人峙如山，迨回則四面轉旋，背馬而立，再接再厲，凌波雙剪，就鞍上倒豎空中，俄而左縈右拂，一觔斗而端坐馬上，斯時叫好者如山崩，如川沸，馬已絕塵而去。至第三次而人貼馬肚，焂上焂落，如轉圈然。自黎明起而旭日東升，而跑馬事畢，卸妝少憇，遊觀者亦散。未幾而上刀山矣，刀山旁倚一軟梯，係兩繩縛刀，以便拾級而登，每級約去二尺餘，刀計二十餘柄，梯卽二十餘級，日中鑼聲乍響，遊人復集，兩女子聯步而上，謂上刀山。嗣至中腰，作倒捲珠簾勢，翻觔斗，就鋒刃中蟬聯而上，將到絕頂，上橫一刀，背向上而刃向下者，就中少坐。俄而一婦一僮續登，捷如升木之猱，至梯不能容，於是緣登絕頂，坐於椅卓之上，兩女就椅圈手作豎蜻蜓翻蛺蝶諸劇，俄一女倒懸，故作失足，從空墜下，是時觀者心膽俱碎，乃目不及瞬，而女以足繞得一繩，已翻身卓立矣。數日間，遠近來觀者絡繹不絕於途云。</p>

<h3>耶穌是婦女的救主</h3>
<p>猶主和一切古代民族，都有重男輕女的習俗創世記記載「女出於男」，猶太人誤解了，因此在他們數千年的歷史中，演出了種種輕視婦女的悲劇。我們古來，未明眞理，虐待婦女，至為殘酷「女子無才便是德」，「男主外女主內」，以致婦女在社會上毫無地位；又有「三從四德」，以及「七出」等奴化敎育和制度，約束她們，成為男子的附庸玩具。其實婦女生育，也是十月懷胎；除了生理組織與男人略有不同外，本無男尊女卑的階級。耶穌來世後，不因猶太人輕視婦女，他也輕視；反而尊重她們，提高了她們的地位，與男人平等。</p>
<p>耶穌主張男女犯姦，一同科罪，又主張男子可以休姦淫的女子，却未曾限定女子不可休犯姦淫的男子，祂又主張一夫一妻為聖經眞理，不可誤解經文，或藉人定的律法而輕易分離。祂更進一步的警告男子說：「凡看見婦女就動淫念的，這人心裏已經與她犯了姦淫」。</p>
<p>耶穌在世的時候，不論傳佈福音，醫治疾病，趕鬼談道，赦免罪孽，都沒分男女。攷查聖經，彰明昭著，無可否認的。並且祂死後三日復活過來，道德向一婦女名叫馬利亞的顯現。歐洲第一個信徒，是一位婦女就是賣紫色布的呂底亞，中國第一所的女學，乃是耶穌敎會所創辦的。其他基督敎舉辦造福婦女的機關，和提高女婦地位的事實，多得不可勝數。</p>
<p>總而言之耶穌敎到一處地方，那地的婦女就得着了解放和拯救，試讀古今史上的歷史，再看我國社會的現象；最受痛苦，最受壓迫，最受蹂躪的算是婦女。吓！現代的世界正在大量的製造孤獨寡婦，使婦女痛苦上再加痛苦。現代的世界施用種種的壓力，迫得婦女走上罪惡滅亡的路途。誰是婦女的救主呢？感謝上主！因為耶穌被差事遣到世上來，祂來了原是要施行拯救。深願我國的女同胞，快快回頭，接受你們的敎主耶穌基督。</p>

<p>什麼叫做死人？一個人呼吸斷了就叫死人嗎？在普通一般人的回答或許是如此的。但是當你更深一層更有力的問一句：到底那一種人叫做死人？那麼，愛迪生已經回答過說：「每一個沒有價值的人便是死人。」在古時菲在哥拉斯（Pgthagoras）的學校裏面，如果有人厭倦讀書而要退出的時候，他們大家就當他去的時候，舉行一個喪儀，替他立起墳墓碑銘，藉此來警告其他的學生，因為他們以為那個退出的學生是一個死人，而希望其餘的人們不要步他的後塵。同樣，在那時天主敎盛行的國家裏，每一個女人當她進修道院的時候，總是帶了棺材同去，而且舉行莊嚴的葬禮，來表示以後她是不能有所作為那就是死了！</p>
<p>依了這個見解，我們去看世界，我們可以見到有許多有權有勢，吃得好穿得好的傢伙已經死了。他們僅僅維持着虛幻的生命，裝飾的現顯，但是實在講來，豈不是與行屍走肉無異？只有那些在世界上的人們，他們的目的是要改進自己的身心，增加別人的福利的人，方可以算是活的。在人生短短的六七十年之間，照現在的情形看來，那麼一個人活的時期只有幾年，而大部的世界都充滿了死人而已。有的人到二十歲方始活，有的人到三十歲方始活，有的人到六十歲方始活，而有的人却在未活之前早已鳴呼了！</p>
<p>當古時波斯國王達克珊斯（Xerxes）立在小山上望的時候，他不禁流淚想，這麼許多人軍隊在一百年後是沒有一個再可以生存了！所以愛迪生說：「當我看了這人口眾多的城市以後，我忍不住流淚了！因為在這許多人中沒有幾個現在是活着的，而觀察他們致死的原因，大都是由一種毀滅力量很大的疾病所侵襲而起，這一種疾病普通就稱之為「懶惰」。所以我們應該盡力剷除這種疫癘，盡力設法促進青年的早生！老年的復活！……！」</p>
<p>你願意做一個死人嗎？你願意被人目為死人嗎？如果不願意，那麼趕快檢點自己的生活有沒有意義，有沒有被「懶惰」所侵襲，而向活的大道邁進！</p>

<h3>列寗的遺骸</h3>
<p>— 振作</p>
<p>蘇俄在最近的國際間，除美國外，可說是世界上，最使人注目的國家了。而蘇俄有今日的成功，使人想起了創造蘇俄的國父列寗。他是世界偉要之一，且為世界上唯一的能保存遺骸迄今的人。列寗卒於一九二四年一月二十一日，到今年已滿十六載，其遺骸在莫斯科紅塲。列寗的墳墓，完全用花崗石造的，墓道頗曲折。惟建築式樣單純而莊嚴。往參觀者，循石級而下，至一廣室，中央卽列寗遺蛻所在地。上鋪紅色褥毯，屍身置於玻璃柩內，自外可見彼遺容，身上覆絨毯，頭肩及二手外露，然如熟睡，面色稍帶灰白。其遺容能如此長存，供萬人瞻仰，均有賴於蘇俄的兩位特出科學家的功勞。</p>
<p>當列寗卒於莫斯科郊外的哥羅基府邸時，政府命令在遺骸上，施用施腐術，在血管內注射防腐劑溶液，但此種方法，未生大效。當時瞻仰遺容者，盈千累萬，摩肩踵接。列寗一月二十一日逝世，到二月中旬，至紅塲瞻仰者，已有十餘萬人，但二月末，遺骸皮膚已顯出乾燥，而變色，知所施之防腐術，有另行研究的必要；故當時卽禁止人民接近屍旁，且一度停止瞻仰。再由當局召集國內著名科學家多人，討論保持遺容的不起變化。可是數次會議結果，異口同聲說，這是不可能的，因屍體在空氣中，及普通氣溫下，欲使其外表組織不生變化，是不能辦別的，古時埃及的木乃伊，亦不過是防止屍體的不再分解，而要使面貌不變，最近的科學上，尙未發明。但史太林聘請著名解剖學者烏羅皮夫敎授，及生物化學家史巴羅司基敎授，兩位苦心研究，乃創造一種獨特方法，可使容貌長存，永久不變。就在一九二四年三月二十六日，再施行手術，使顏面不再萎縮，可使細胞組織，停止自行崩壞過程，於是列寗的遺蛻，成為木乃伊化。此種方法，是應用解剖學上及生物化學上，最新知識技能而成功的。兩敎授經四個月的努力，遂於七月二十六日大功告成，達到預期的目的。而列墓重行開放，供人民瞻仰，現在經過十六年幾月，來此參觀的，計有一千六百萬人以上了。每逢外人來莫斯科時，參觀遺容，成為必要的節目。且遺容至今完好如初，而日後亦可不起變化，兩敎授亦一直負保管照料之工作。惟烏羅皮夫敎授，已於一九三七年去世，今由史敎授，及其助手數人，繼續擔任。</p>

<h3>造命</h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>生活在這生存競爭的社會上，每個人都應培養一種堅强的自信心，不管是如何艱困的環境，多少次數的失敗，我們總應拿最大的毅力去克服牠。越過了重重的黑暗，必定會踏上光明的途程的。有許多人偶遇患難而沮喪，或因逆境而灰心，他們鼓不起勇氣來作進一步的奮鬥。頹廢，餒氣，失望，消沈，由此葬送了他們的前途，使他們對於生活感到沒有絲毫留戀的價值。</p>
<p>在悠長的人生旅途中，決不會永遠一帆風順，沒有意外的打擊。如果遇着指拂逆之境而不想去克服，徒逃避進取的責任，因難將永不能離開。這充分地表現出厭世色彩的定命思想，以為人們功業的成敗得失都繫於注定的命運，不是人為的努力所可挽回的。</p>
<p>其實，命運並不眞是我們成功的牽絆。古往今來，不知有多少的事業家學術家，靠了堅强的自信和毅力，經過無數的艱苦，卒能對人類有偉大的貢獻。無疑的他們是擺脫了命運的繩縛，成為支配命運的人了。為什麼說他們是支配命運的人呢？因為他們相信自己，必能克服險惡的環境，向旣定的目標做去。困難只是磨練他們的有力因素，失敗增加他們繼續奮鬥的勇氣；他們對於生活，有確切的信仰，任何挫折和阻擾，不足以動搖他們的意志。這一般人的成功，實由於他們能夠「造命」，認定命運握在他們手裏，不是別人可以操縱的。</p>
<p>相反的，那般經不起風浪襲擊的弱者，遇着逆境，只有消極的忍受和順應，好像注定了應被命運所播弄似的，從不作突破艱難的打算，甚至由「安命」而至「怨命」，自歏自嗟，以為遭逢厄運，是無可奈何的事，除了憤恨埋怨命運多乖外，簡直找不出較好的路徑。</p>
<p>易卜生說：「你要把這塊材料鑄陶成器，」這話很能警惕我們，要堅定生活的自信，從刻苦中磨練自己，敎育自己，永遠地做一個「造命」的人！</p>

<h3>舞后的歸突</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第三章　對立的情報</p>
<p>我一聽這話，不能不承認這局勢更有進展了。剛纔金梅一再說，余甘棠從十一那天吵嘴以後不曾來過，我就覺得好像故意為他掩飾，現在果然證實了。但伊為什麼如此呢？</p>
<p>霍桑點點頭說：「我從金梅的口氣裏，已猜到那余甘棠昨夜來過。老毛，他昨夜什麼時候來的？你怎麼會看見他？你昨夜不是出去看戲的嗎？」</p>
<p>老毛道：「就在我出門看戲的當兒看見的。那時大約在七點鐘光景，我剛纔走出門口，忽見他站在門口。」</p>
<p>「他可曾招呼你？」</p>
<p>「他問我「王小姐在家嗎？」我回答他不在。他又問：「趙伯雄今天來過沒有？」我又回答他不曾，又問他有什麼事。他却不理睬我，回頭就走。」</p>
<p>霍桑沉吟了一下，又道：「你說他是兇手，可是就為着這兩件事？」　　老毛搖頭道：「不，還有——還有更可疑的事。」</p>
<p>「還有更可疑的事？什麼？」</p>
<p>「昨天早晨，我在樓梯上洗抹的時候，他來了一個電話——先生，那電話箱就在樓梯的轉灣處。」</p>
<p>「是你接聽的嗎？」</p>
<p>「是，他沒有說姓名，不過我聽得出是他的聲音。他要王小姐接談，我就上樓去報告伊。」</p>
<p>「王小姐可曾接談？」</p>
<p>老毛點點頭。「接談的，可是談了不多幾句，便在電話中吵起來。」　（四三）</p>

<p>㳺藝界</p>
<p>游蹤藝</p>
<h3>都有理由</h3>
<p>— 小田</p>
<p>墨子摩頂放踵以利天下為之。楊子為我，拔一毛以利天下，不為也。細想起來，也各有各的理由。墨子情願犧牲自己為天下人盡義務，假使人人都能犧牲自己來替別人盡義務，那末世界之上，那裏還有甚麼權利之爭呢？楊子拔一毛來利人是不肯幹的，但是反過來說，也決不要別人拔一毛來利我，假使人人抱着不肯吃虧也不要佔便宜的宗旨，那末天下也就無事了。英國要掃滅侵略者，說是為保持和平而戰，德國攻破了無數國家，說是為要爭取永久和平，法國始而抗德，繼而降敵，終而反英，却也振振有詞，眞是都有理由。</p>
<p>講到在游藝界很有勢力的平劇藝員們，也是如此，譚富英是墨守典型，馬連良是多念少唱，推陳出新，言菊朋是以老根底對付着自己嗓子，遇到要彩處，把尺寸一拉慢，嗓子一放大，不由的台下彩聲就來了，這是限於天賦，不使狠勁，又不能迎合台下心理，我們祇當加以原諒，至於四聲陰陽，叫天之後，還要算他最講究呢。梅蘭芳嗓音寬亮，配上一把響堂的二胡，好聽。程硯秋嗓微枯澀，不用細音，便少纏綿悱惻之致。有幾個學梅的人，拼命把尺寸拉慢，學程的人，拼命把嗓音逼細，學馬的人，最好載詞裏編上幾十個入聲的「不」字，（按北曲無人聲，北平話祇從前趕驢車的有個「搭」字，還有就是連良的「不」字了）倒說不如此便不能逼肖，眞是都有理由。</p>
<p>舞女說，舞客不是些瘟生曲死，就是些洋盤牙籤。對待瘟生，架子越大越好，你要放點良心出來，稍微遷就些，他便當你無人問津的起碼貨，棄之如敝屣了。曲死是根本不識好歹，人云亦云。洋盤是不敲不響。牙籤是未籤時不惜任何犧牲。　過後反面無情，六親不認。所以要他們用眞心來對待人，恐怕還不止沙裏掏金，幾乎似海底撈月。舞客說，舞女們根本都是些水性楊花朝秦暮楚之流，能夠曉得寶貴大洋錢，就算上上乘了。能夠認識化大洋錢客人，那更是無上上乘了。這話聽去好像未免太過份一點，其實大部分舞女，都忘記了她們的青春祇有短短的七八年，所以賺來的錢，束手來，西手去，而且化得一無名色，所以抱塊石子，還有摩光的一天，若是想把舞女的眞情義磨出來，恐怕比石子還難哩。眞是都有理由。</p>
<p>末了再講到我們票界，有的講究字斟句酌，尋源窮理，說票友所以高出內行的，就在這一點上。有的不問原理，苦練實習，說最要緊就是上臺不幸。有的說，我們根本不賣錢，旣不必窮究學理，也無須練習功夫，祇要抓上幾句詞，扮上一個角，在臺上那麼一過癮，豈不快哉。有的說，上臺串戲，根本沒有甚麼可樂，旣不喜歡研究，何必化錢找罪受呢？眞是都有理由。</p>
<p>總之，正理祇一條，歪理十八條，至於那一條是正理，還是自己去批判罷。</p>
<h3>聽譚富英等角略評（下）</h3>
<p>上城樓前之一段一緊打慢唱，「至叫老軍掃街道」道字，忽放異彩，又高又亮又夠筋，餘子難及，此英秀之遺傳，眞撒手　也。「我本是臥龍崗散淡的人」一句極好，非余腔，人字高出好，「保定乾坤」定字下加一了字，「下南陽」陽字後變虛音嚬字，非英秀舊規，二六板一般，得彩聲最多，人嘉其飄逸，我嫌其太花巧，斬謖中「難消恨」用高腔，亦自不易，富英這齣戲，雖大純中不免小疵，第二人尙唱不到此，叔岩久不能唱，菊朋唱法已變，須讓富英獨步矣。捉放曹由過關公堂起，公堂陳宮之唱，本是老調，我曾學於老伶工陳福勝王玉芳二先生，今聽富英，將老腔加以變化，末段快板變為「緊打慢唱，」不知是誰開此先河也。殺家中「嚇得我三魂七魄忙，」一句，甚好，「陳宮心中似刀扎」一段尺寸太快，殺呂一塲中，「陳宮」宮字使本音嘎調，悶而不亮，「你一家大小」家字異常高嚮，如奇峯突出，高揷天際，精彩之至，眞實力量，人不能及。「聽他言」一段，內家腔好，咬字不合，「勤解於他」後加呀字，用叔岩唱法，不妙；「一輪明月」一句，全同叔岩唱法，下字用花腔，覺得欠沉着總以緊守譚氏法為是，末段散板，「做事差，」差字使「調商，」可證猶有餘力，難能可貴矣。</p>
<p>餘如哈寶山空城中扮王平，捉放中扮呂伯奢，皆以全力赴之，算得硬裏子中之佼佼，王泉奎空戰中起司馬懿，捉放中起曹操，以曹操為更佳，尤以過關公堂之唱，確實有根有譜，凈角中吃調　高者，當數斯人首屈一指，使其嗓音再大，則可與金少山分庭抗禮矣。葉盛茂空城中起馬謖臉整個頭均出色，嗓子亦有，將來可城名凈，慈瑞全之丑，為碩果僅存者，惜民初吾在春明，卽見其與各名伶配戲，今二十餘年矣，空城中先扮報子三次出塲，知其人者甚少，及改扮老軍，始有人注意，然其年已甚老，嗓子不能嚮堂矣。計艷芬與陳麗芬配二本虹霓關之東方氏，身材眉目甚佳，做工亦老到，扮像頗似朱琴心也，姜妙香常來滬，有目共賞不贅。</p>
<h3>弄堂房子上舞台</h3>
<p>— 菲菲</p>
<p>「上海屋簷下」的演出</p>
<p>這是劇作家夏衍君的最新嘗試，是中國話劇舞台上從未應用過的新的表現技巧，描寫上海人生活的「上海屋簷下」，它的裝置已由分幕而改為立體，這里出現的是工人區域中的弄堂房子，而這幢弄堂房子便直轟在舞台上，客堂間，灶披間，亭子間，前樓，後樓，三層擱，一點也不假的放在觀眾面前，觀眾就像生活在這所弄堂房子里，看到這房子里所有的人的活動，這里有失業的悲哀，失戀的痛苦，有娼妓的生活，有人海的沉浮，這里所表現的，完全是現實的。</p>
<p>夏衍這一劇本原為條件俱備的業餘劇團而寫，業餘旣因戰而停頓，這一新型的戲遂一直沒有為力量不足的小劇團所能演出。這次上海劇藝社終於開始了這最艱難的工作，就拿裝置一項來講，原來的佈景師，已不能完成它，而另外聘請了一位建築工程師一建造的，工程之浩大，化錢之多，不問可知。「上海屋簷下」將於下星期二演出了，這戲的別緻，必然會引起人們的注意。</p>

<h3>British and Japanese Negotiations on the Yunnan-Burma Road Transportation Issue: Japanese Communiqué States Satisfactory Progress in Negotiations; Detailed Statement to be Released Within Days</h3>
<p>Tokyo - According to a Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Foreign Minister Arita and British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie had satisfactory progress today in discussions regarding supplies transported to China via Burma. The statement released tonight said that the British Ambassador visited the Foreign Minister at 4 p.m. to continue discussions on the Burma Road issue, which concluded at 6 p.m. The talks had satisfactory progress, and it is hoped that a more detailed statement will be released on Monday. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Today, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated that the UK and Japan have not yet begun any formal negotiations. However, Japan hopes that after the clouds currently shrouding them dissipate, relations between the two countries will improve. When a reporter asked if there were any differences in the translations of the statements made by the US and Japan regarding the Dutch East Indies, the spokesperson replied that although both Tokyo and Washington have issued statements regarding maintaining the status quo of the Dutch East Indies, the US and Japan have never directly discussed this issue, so it is not appropriate to comment. Someone also asked about news reports that Britain had requested the US government to pool British resources with those of the Western Hemisphere to prevent raw materials from falling into the hands of Italy, Germany, Japan, and others considered unfriendly to London. The spokesperson replied that this issue was very important and declined to comment further. Finally, the spokesperson also relayed that there are still many unresolved issues in Japanese-Soviet relations, and the Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union has presented them one by one for resolution. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>London - Well-informed sources here reported last night that the British government will soon instruct its ambassador to Tokyo, Sir Robert Craigie, to "soften further" its response to Japan's demand to close the Yunnan-Burma Road. After Japanese Ambassador to London Mamoru Shigemitsu met with British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, reiterating Japan's demands, Britain seems to be adopting a more appropriate policy towards Japan. It is heard that the Japanese ambassador warned Halifax that Britain's strong stance on this issue would strengthen the measures of radical elements in Tokyo, who advocate closer relations between Japan and the Rome-Berlin Axis. Last week, Britain rejected Japan's demand to block traffic on the Yunnan-Burma Road, which caused anti-British sentiment in the Japanese press. Japanese Foreign Minister Arita requested the British government last Monday to reconsider its response. The reply to this request has not yet been submitted to Tokyo. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie held further talks with Foreign Minister Arita on the Yunnan-Burma Road transportation issue this afternoon, which lasted for two hours. According to a Foreign Ministry spokesperson, the talks have made satisfactory progress, and it is hoped that a more detailed statement can be released in a short time. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - Japanese Consul-General in Hong Kong, Okazaki, told reporters yesterday that he had received a copy of the demands made by the Japanese government to the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, but his position prevented him from discussing its contents. This matter is being handled by the British and Japanese governments. According to the English-language China Mail published in Hong Kong, there are three points of contention between Britain and Japan: (1) to prohibit all supplies from being transported to Chongqing, (2) to stop anti-Japanese propaganda in Hong Kong, and (3) to close Chinese political organizations in Hong Kong. It is reported that the Hong Kong government is currently considering this matter, and negotiations are progressing smoothly. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Japan Decides to Send Additional Inspectors</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Naval Department of the Imperial Headquarters issued a communiqué stating that it will send another group of inspectors to Guangzhouwan, a French leased territory. It is said that the Japanese Navy has decided to dispatch over ten inspectors, led by Captain Maruyama, to Guangzhouwan to observe the French cessation of all aid materials being transported to General Chiang Kai-shek through that area. Guangzhouwan is a narrow strip of coastal territory in Guangdong Province, including the islands of Donghai and Nanzhou (both transliterated), with a total population of 250,000, including over two hundred French nationals. It was leased to France under a treaty signed on November 16, 1898, for a term of 99 years. Previously, due to the increasing blockade of China's coast, the Chongqing government shifted its attention to Vietnam and Guangzhouwan as supply routes. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Japanese Naval Ministry recently announced that it has dispatched twelve inspectors to Guangzhouwan to monitor the transport of goods to Chongqing. The French authorities in Guangzhouwan have apparently reached an understanding with the Japanese, similar to a Franco-Japanese agreement. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Japanese side dispatched ten inspectors to the French leased territory of Guangzhouwan, who departed today. (Associated Press, 12th)</p>
<p>One Aircraft Lost in Accident</p>
<p>Hong Kong - According to sources on the French side here, a French airline plane chartered by a trust has crashed near Guangzhouwan on July 8 and was destroyed. The wreckage of the plane has not yet been found. The plane was specifically carrying one Japanese inspector from Hanoi to Guangzhouwan, with three French crew members. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - News today indicates that a French airline passenger plane carrying multiple Japanese inspectors to Indochina crashed near Baya Bao last week. Before the plane was destroyed, the air crew sent a wireless message stating, "Violent storm approaching, I am abandoning the aircraft." After these words were heard, the plane's radio immediately cut off. In addition to the Japanese inspectors, the plane also carried one French national residing in Hong Kong. The details of the accident are not yet known. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<h3>The Jiangnan Chinese Army is Extremely Active</h3>

<p>Yidu - The Japanese army occupying Yichang has been constantly attacking the south bank in recent days. The Chinese army has annihilated no less than 5,000 Japanese soldiers in An'anmiao, Shangxia Wulong, and other places one after another. The remaining Japanese are still being heavily besieged by the Chinese, and it will not be difficult to eliminate them. Chinese artillery has also demonstrated great power, fiercely bombarding the Japanese concentrations inside Yichang city. Two large Japanese warehouses have been destroyed by Chinese attacks, and the Japanese losses are enormous. The Chinese army also shot down eight Japanese aircraft in the An'anmiao area one after another, and the wreckage of four Japanese aircraft has been found by the Chinese. A Chinese unit on the Hanyi Road once occupied Yaquelin and Longquanting, killing more than 2,000 Japanese. The Chinese are still fighting fiercely nearby. (11th)</p>

<h3>Japan's Trade Deficit Increases</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Japan's trade with countries outside the Yen Bloc continued to decline in the first half of this year, with the trade deficit reaching ¥503,085,000, an increase of ¥75,640,000 compared to the same period last year. The total value of exports in the first half of this year was ¥2,018,980,000, an increase of ¥403,456,000 compared to the same period last year, but most of it was exported to Yen Bloc countries. As for imported goods, three-quarters came from countries outside the Yen Bloc. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<h3>Military Affairs Commission Spokesperson Discusses Widespread Defection of Puppet Troops; Over 20,000 Puppet Troops in Eastern Henan Pledge Allegiance; Chinese Army Annihilates Many Japanese Troops; Laying the Foundation for Victory in the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>Chongqing - In the past week, the war situation in various places has mostly been in a stalemate, but the defection of puppet troops has been widespread, like bamboo shoots after rain. Their battle achievements are truly astonishing. According to a military spokesperson speaking to a Central News Agency reporter, this puppet army defection movement is sweeping and large-scale, showing that people are thinking of the Han people and that victory in the War of Resistance is imminent. This not only completely shatters the Japanese dream of using Chinese to control Chinese, but also lays the foundation for China's final victory. A brief description of the puppet army's defection in various places is as follows: On the 31st of last month, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack into the city of Kaifeng. That night, in addition to annihilating more than 2,000 Japanese, they also destroyed more than ten bunkers and occupied the puppet police station, the Kempeitai, and special service agencies, destroying more than 30 vehicles. At that time, the three divisions of the puppet army in eastern Henan under Chen Jie (formerly Zhang Lanfeng), including Song Kebin, Cao Dazhong, and Li Zhongyi, with a total of more than 20,000 people and guns, took the opportunity to defect and assist the national army, attacking Bo County, Luyi, Shangqiu, and other places in various directions, killing thousands of Japanese and capturing many Japanese officers. Another unit fiercely attacked Yucheng, annihilating more than 300 Japanese soldiers and capturing eight artillery pieces, eleven light and heavy machine guns, more than 140 rifles, and more than 100,000 rounds of ammunition. Zhang's unit was the largest and most powerful part of the Japanese puppet army. The sudden defection caused great panic among the Japanese. At the same time, the puppet army under Wang Shouyin in Suixian County, taking advantage of the national army's attack on the Japanese outposts of Ma'anshan and Maping, surrendered one after another, attacking the city from both inside and outside. The Japanese inside the city suffered heavy losses. It is also heard that the puppet army in Suiyuan and Mongolia is also wavering. (11th)</p>
<h3>All Circles in Guangdong Conclude July 7th Donation</h3>
<p>Shaoguan - The "July 7th" donation from all circles in Guangdong has now concluded. The total amount from Qujiang County and neighboring areas reached 30,000 yuan. Other counties are still remitting their contributions. In addition, the 3,000 yuan donated by Christians has been remitted to the central government and forwarded to the front lines to comfort the soldiers fighting the war. (12th)</p>
<h3>Continuous Rainfall in Western Sichuan</h3>
<p>Chengdu - After receiving rainfall on the 29th in Western Sichuan, continuous rainfall has occurred from time to time for the past ten days. As of the 12th, all counties have celebrated sufficient moisture, and the ditches and canals in Chengdu have been filled.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>From the Current Situation of Industry and Commerce to Plan for the Future</h3>
<p>In these two or three months, the Shanghai market has been extremely turbulent, with extreme ups and downs. Foreign exchange went from tight to plentiful, and the price of gold (per ten taels) fell from more than 7,000 yuan to just over 5,000 yuan. 20-count cotton yarn fell from over 1,800 yuan per bale to as low as about 800 yuan, and along with cotton yarn, raw cotton and finished cotton cloth also fell. This has dealt a very serious blow to the industrial and commercial sectors and general speculators. It is also heard that the New York stock market suffered a severe slump, with Chinese magnates suffering huge losses. The Shanghai foreign stock market has seen prices fall steadily. Those who valued foreign stocks as treasures have now lost everything, yet it is still not enough to make up for their heavy losses. Only rice, wheat flour, fish, meat, vegetables, oil, and sauce, which are indispensable for life, have remained stable and even risen. Since money flows constantly, coming and going indefinitely, and the money earned by labor and sweat cannot always be protected, how can the gains from speculation and ill-gotten gains be? The ancient saying that ill-gotten gains are ill-spent is clearly true. Therefore, their successes and failures are not worth mentioning or worrying about. What is truly heartbreaking is that every time the market goes through a storm, the vitality of the people is further diminished.</p>
<p>The cause of the storm is said to be the result of white-hot speculation, which is certainly true. However, the complexity of the international situation and the world economy is also an important factor, which cannot be denied. Since the winds of change in Europe and the West have had far-reaching impacts, Shanghai's concessions have been filled with rumors, and industrial and commercial operators have been at a loss. Therefore, they have waited and watched, resulting in invisible stagnation. This cannot all be blamed on speculators. As the Japanese took the opportunity to put pressure on British and French territories in the Far East, the French first succumbed, and all areas bordering the interior of Vietnam and Guangzhouwan were blockaded. The Chinese sections along Hong Kong were also occupied by the Japanese army. As a result, the southwestern roads lost their agility and convenience, which directly dealt a major blow to Shanghai's industry and commerce. At the same time, the deterioration of relations between Britain and France meant that shipping between the two countries' territories in the Far East was in danger of being interrupted. Industrial and commercial circles had no confidence in what cargo transport in Southeast Asia would be like in the future. As for the commerce between northern China and the southern and central regions, which were originally one family, they are now different races. Since June 26, the Japanese have reduced the scope and strengthened control over remittances and commercial goods between North China and other places. In the south and central regions, they have also imposed various restrictions on goods transported from the north. Therefore, commerce in the occupied areas of northern and southern China will inevitably suffer a sharp decline due to fragmentation. What will take its place is Japanese goods. This is the inevitable consequence of a harsh and meticulous squeeze policy.</p>
<p>In addition, the constant rise in prices has invisibly reduced general purchasing power. This can be clearly seen in the attempts to cut prices that have not helped to alleviate the deserted business. Merchants, burdened by accumulated difficulties and yearning for last year's windfall profits, failed to understand the changes in the situation and intended to hoard more goods in order to obtain huge profits. Unexpectedly, they achieved the opposite and suffered huge losses. Raw materials for industry, such as cotton, wheat, and silkworm cocoons, have also been swept up by the Japanese in the name of "control," with the prices being searched and collected into their own pockets for use in their factories. Even if Chinese factory owners offer high prices, it is not easy to obtain them. The result is that Chinese-owned factories will either close down or submit, seeking a share of the remaining profits through the "cooperation" technique. We can only use expensive foreign exchange to obtain raw materials from overseas. Since the cost is high, how can we compete in the market? On the other hand, sales of bulk export goods such as silk and tea have declined sharply in Europe and Africa, regardless of the decline in tea prices at the production sites. When new silkworm cocoons were released, each picul could be sold for around 200 yuan, but now, with silk sales sluggish and factory silk burdened with heavy donations and taxes, exports are greatly hindered. Native silk in western Zhejiang is sold for 70 or 80 yuan, but there are still few buyers. Rice and grain are for domestic consumption only, so there is no worry about insufficient supply. However, in addition to using war to support war, the Japanese grain merchants in the occupied areas often pay the price of two piculs for only one picul of rice and grain, and there is still the difficulty of transportation, so they have to rely on Vietnam and Siam. Recently, there are also concerns that rice shipped from Hong Kong will be blockaded once it is, so foreign rice is arriving in an endless stream. Vietnamese rice, due to the Mediterranean war, has no way to be shipped west to supply France and Italy. This seems to offer some hope of alleviating the panic of rice shortages in Shanghai, but it is widely heard that the Japanese have already made plans to monopolize it, and the future is uncertain.</p>
<p>All of this has a diminishing impact on Shanghai's industry and commerce, day by day. How should those in the industry be vigilant as soon as possible!</p>
<h3>President Chiang's Closing Remarks at the Seventh Plenary Session: Facing the Changing International Environment with a Spirit of Self-Improvement; Japan's So-Called East Asian Monroe Doctrine Cannot Justify Itself</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Seventh Plenary Session concluded on the afternoon of July 8th. President Chiang personally delivered the closing remarks, elaborating in great detail on the recent international environment and the efforts of party members and the people. The full text has been finalized, and a brief summary is as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow comrades, the Seventh Plenary Session has now concluded, and we are holding the closing ceremony. For the past eight days, despite the intense heat and the bombing raids by Japanese aircraft, all of you have worked hard and diligently, without fearing hardship or danger, allowing this session to achieve a successful outcome. I firmly believe that if we maintain this spirit and continue to strive forward, there is no difficulty that we cannot overcome. I am even more confident that our revolutionary cause of resistance and nation-building will be completed as scheduled. This time, the number of comrades attending was particularly enthusiastic, the session was relatively long, and the number of resolutions passed was also particularly high. In addition to the daily plenary sessions, the various review committees were also particularly careful and diligent. The comrades devoted their entire time each day to the session, and all proposals were carefully discussed by everyone with concentrated effort, resulting in concrete resolutions. It can be said that the spirit and achievements of this session surpass all previous plenary sessions. All of our resolutions will be implemented in the future with this spirit, seeking practical results. The will of the session has been expressed in the declaration and does not need to be repeated. Today, on the occasion of the closing, I would like to share a few important points with you. First, I must explain that the environment in which we are now resisting the war, both before and during our session, has seen extraordinary and drastic changes in the international situation. Recently, Japan's words and actions in the Pacific have become increasingly嚣张 and bizarre. All of you comrades have paid particular attention to international issues this time, so I would like to further elaborate on this during the closing. In my opinion, no matter how the international environment evolves, the most important thing is that we ourselves have a solid foundation of perseverance, unyielding spirit, and self-improvement. If we have a strong foundation, then no matter how the international situation changes, it will only benefit our country and will not have any disadvantages. The spirit of our revolutionary resistance has always been to be diligent and courageous, and to persevere to the end, and we must not be affected in the slightest by whether the international environment is favorable or unfavorable. Moreover, the current international environment is particularly favorable to us, approaching our expected direction step by step, and even more in line with our goals of struggle. Now, I will cite a recent example to illustrate this to you comrades. What I want to talk about is Japan's high-profile advocacy of "East Asia's Autonomy" at the end of last month, as well as the recent remarks by the US President's secretary regarding</p>
<p>the Monroe Doctrine. In order to carry out its traditional aggressive policy of conquering China in order to conquer the world, as stated in the Tanaka Memorial, Japan's consistent tactic has been to use existing terms in the world as a defense to cover up its actions. Since the "September 18th Incident," the Japanese government and public have often chanted the slogan "East Asia for East Asians," and the term "East Asian Monroe Doctrine" has appeared in their public and private propaganda texts. Their intention is nothing more than to exclude Europe and the United States to avoid obstacles to their invasion of China and plunder of Asia, especially targeting the United States, which advocates the "Non-Recognition Doctrine" and "Upholds the Nine-Power Treaty." In their view, the Americas have the Monroe Doctrine, so why can't East Asia be subject to the Monroe Doctrine by Japan? After the recent dramatic changes in Europe, it has肆行 threats in the Dutch East Indies, Vietnam, Nanyang and other places, revealing its锋芒. Since the second half of last month, it has been loudly proclaiming that its government will have a major statement on the "East Asian Monroe Doctrine." Finally, on June 29th, after its Round Table Conference, its Foreign Minister Arita made an informal broadcast, claiming to be the master of East Asia, wanting to include China and Nanyang lands as his "fields based on co-existence,"儼然称自己为「东亚安定势力之日本」," and on the one hand saying that this kind of thought also exists in European and American countries. When we look at his full text, it is really absurd, hoping to敷衍 and threaten the eyes and ears of the world, and opposing, hoping to realize the "East Asian New Order" that everyone厭聞 and惡聞 by changing its name. He doesn't think at all about what kind of environment the so-called Monroe Doctrine was produced in, what era it was in, and what its essence is. To be honest, the Americas have the Monroe Doctrine, and it happened</p>
<p>more than a hundred years ago, and there was the environment of the Americas at that time, so such a doctrine could be produced. Also, because there is a country like the United States that has leadership qualifications and is willing to coexist in equality, mutual assistance and peace with the countries of this continent, the Monroe Doctrine can be promoted for a long time. What era is it now, and what country is Japan? Especially, what is the current environment and geographical situation of Asia? Regardless of the most important factors such as history, culture, population and ethnicity, he ignores them all, thinking that the Monroe Doctrine can be produced casually. He doesn't know that the reason why the United States can achieve the Monroe Doctrine is because the spirit of the Monroe Doctrine is needed by the independent and free countries of the Americas in mutual assistance and self-defense, and it is definitely not the result of military aggression. Moreover, today, in order to truly establish world peace forever, we should have exceeded the regional or partial combination and expanded it into a truly equal, reasonable and effective collective security organization to achieve permanent results. As far as Asia is concerned, only China, with the most ancient culture, the largest population, the largest area, and the closest historical relationship with the various ethnic groups in Asia, can stabilize Asia with its inherent morality and the Three People's Principles, and cooperate with various countries to contribute to the peace of Asia and the world. What qualifications does Japan have today</p>
<p>to talk about "East Asian Autonomy" or even the "East Asian Monroe Doctrine"? You must know that Asia is different from other continents. Asia has its own independent culture, and it also has intricate and close regional relations with various countries in the world. When we mention Asia, we cannot forget that the northern part has Soviet Russia, which spans Europe and Asia. Moreover, due to the relations in various places on the Pacific and Indian Oceans, Asia is not only related to Europe, but also to both the eastern and western hemispheres. Now Japan still俨然 considers itself the ruler of Asia. I will not talk about the foundation of culture and morality for the time being, but just in terms of military force, I really don't know if he has estimated his own strength, and I don't know if he has考憲了 the facts. What exactly does he rely on to chant the Asian Monroe Doctrine? Following the broadcast by the Japanese Foreign Minister, what has attracted general attention is the remarks made by US President's Secretary Olly on July 6. Because the initial telegrams conveyed that in his speech there was a sentence "What the US government hopes and believes should be realized is that all continents adopt the Monroe Doctrine," so short-sighted Japanese thought that his statement had been echoed. In fact, according to his original intention, it was "The US government is willing to see Europe and Asia each adopt the Monroe Doctrine, and the interpretation and application of this Monroe Doctrine are the same as those</p>
<p>practiced in the Americas," that is to say, it should be based on mutual assistance, self-defense, equality and independence. When we look at the full text of his speech, the main purpose is to explain how to deal with the issue of the territories in the Americas of the defeated countries in the European war. As for the Asian issue, his true intention is clearly to oppose Japan's method of oppressing various countries by force, and to oppose Japan's actions of invading and estimating any place by force. Especially for French Annam, he clearly pointed out that "it should be resolved by the countries of East Asia through collective consultation." In simple terms, this sentence means that the United States absolutely opposes Japan using force to invade Annam's freedom and unilaterally dispose of Annam. It can be seen that he has never recognized that Japan will use force alone to dominate Annam and decide its fate. Our general comrades must know that the United States cannot abandon its traditional policy in the Far East and its consistent stand. Moreover, only the United States, which strengthens its consistent主張, is the initiator of the "Nine-Power Treaty." His consistent主張 of respecting the independence of various countries and opening the doors to the Far East is his opposition to Japan's military aggression, opposition to Japan's exclusive dominance, and opposition to Japan's closed-door斗戶. The most important reason is that the United States has been expanding its military power recently and is unusually active. Military expenditure has been increased time and time again. Why is it necessary to expand the military again and again? Of course, it is not only for the Atlantic Ocean, but also to take into account the security of its safety bảo trận and the power of speech on the Pacific Ocean. In terms of the historical relationship in the past, the United States is naturally more concerned about Europe than Asia, but from the perspective of its reality and future establishment, it must attach more importance to Asia than Europe.

<h3>US Congress Declares Recess; Passes Bipartisan Appropriations Bill and Military Law; To Build a Vast Navy in Four Years; Expected to Surpass the Combined Strength of Britain and Japan</h3>
<p>Washington: The House of Representatives yesterday passed the bipartisan naval bill worth $4 billion. At this point, the bill has been formally established. This move will allow the United States to build a vast navy in four years. The bill has been immediately sent to President Roosevelt, and it is expected that he will sign it today so that the construction of 200 new battleships can begin as soon as possible. This bill will make the US Navy larger than the combined navies of Britain and Japan today. After this, the United States will have 800 battleships. At the same time, the Navy Department announced that if Congress can accept President Roosevelt's request again and pass another $4 billion military proposal, the defense of the US Pacific will be more substantial. The request was made by President Roosevelt to Congress in writing on Wednesday, and he also guaranteed that the United States' "self-defense mechanism will be stronger than ever." The Navy Department said that the defense funds that the President recently requested from Congress will be quickly passed by Congress. Regarding the distribution of the funds, $350 million will be used to establish a naval station and naval hospital in Guam, 1,200 miles southeast of Yokohama. The bill also includes $10,699,000 to supplement the defense of Hawaii, including a new naval air station, and $400,000 to establish a naval air station on Midway Island. Another $180,000 will be used to build a new naval airfield on Tutuila Island. The bill also allocates funds to strengthen the US defense in the Caribbean. The largest amount used in this area will be the naval air base in Saint John, worth $3.175 million. The total amount used for naval bases in the Caribbean is $6.056 million. Congress also received a request urging to find ways to develop mobile anti-aircraft batteries, motor torpedo boats, mines, and long-range coastal defense guns, and to have them supervised by experts. Dr. Mead, an expert from President Roosevelt's Civil Defense Committee, announced that he had heard that countless contracts had been considered to rush to build 25,000 aircraft for the army and navy within two years. Since President Roosevelt decided to submit another $4,848,171,000 defense plan on Wednesday, the executive department's rearmament plan has reached $14 billion. President Roosevelt told Congress, "If the United States needs national defense, it must be a complete national defense." The President also said, "We will not let anyone believe that the United States is a weak country." (United Press, 11th)</p>

<p>US Naval Commander-in-Chief in Secret Talks with Roosevelt</p>
<p>Washington: Vice Admiral Lee, the naval commander-in-chief who is preparing to go to Hawaii to command the fleet, conferred with President Roosevelt at the White House yesterday. Although what was discussed was not disclosed, knowledgeable people here believe that what the two discussed was the future actions of the US Navy. Vice Admiral Lee is scheduled to fly to San Francisco today, and then take a fast plane from San Francisco to Honolulu. (International News Agency, 12th)</p>

<h3>It is Reported That the Axis Powers Encourage Japan to Join the War; Japan Continues to Use Empty Threats Against France, Britain, and the United States; Military Experts Observe That Japan Cannot Afford to Take Risks</h3>
<p>Washington: The US government is indeed hoping that the current difficulties in Shanghai can be resolved peacefully on the spot. Officials here are carefully refraining from making statements that could worsen the situation. However, everyone knows that anti-American clamor has been intentionally stirred up. According to reliable information here, Germany is extremely active in Tokyo's diplomatic circles, doing everything possible to蛊惑, wanting Japan to join the Axis powers in the war in order to困擾 Britain and seize any or all of the territories of Britain, France, and the Netherlands in the Pacific region. People here expect Berlin to intend to let Japan keep the land it has seized as a result, and Tokyo seems to know this. According to news from diplomatic circles, Japan has been very careful in handling matters so far. What it has done is only to see how it can make France, Britain, and the United States give in under its empty threats. Now that France has succumbed to Nazi rule, Japan's empty threats against the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway have been successful. However, its threats against the Yunnan-Burma Road have failed to intimidate Britain. Now it wants to test the mood of the United States in Shanghai. Washington is now deeply interested in watching Japan's subsequent actions, because it expects that Japan's empty threats against Britain and the United States will all fail. The German fleet is still berthed in domestic ports, and the Italian fleet has also avoided war. Therefore, there are very few signs of the US battle fleet sailing away from the vicinity of Hawaii. According to military experts, if the Japanese navy risks trying to逞 in the Dutch East Indies or Malaya, it will see that a stronger fleet is stationed between its risky land and its far-away domestic base, and at least it will feel inconvenient. The American flag is still fluttering on the Philippine Islands, which it must defend. In addition, the US State Department has clarified that the Monroe Doctrine's remarks made by President Roosevelt's secretary at the end of last week are remarks made on policy, and the remarks made by Secretary of State Hull last Friday are indeed the policy of the United States. Check Hull's statement that the United States has not changed its stance, and it cannot tolerate the transfer of Western Hemisphere territory from one European country to another. The Monroe Doctrine has nothing to do with the fact that several European countries own territory in the Americas while other countries do not. The Monroe Doctrine is purely a policy of self-defense, intended to maintain the independence and integrity of the countries of the Americas. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma Yakichiro recently told the press that Japan is still willing to adjust its relations with the United States in order to clear the clouds over the relations between the two countries. He also said that when the United States abolished the US-Japan Commercial Treaty signed in 1911 last summer, the United States already knew that Japan was very willing to adjust its relations with the United States, because at that time "our cards were placed on the table." Suma said that Japan expressed its willingness to adjust relations with the United States and conclude a new commercial treaty at that time. However, Suma also said that there are currently no negotiations underway here to improve US-Japan relations. When asked whether the United States and Japan have conflicting views on the issue of maintaining the status quo of the Dutch East Indies, Suma said that the two countries have never directly discussed this issue, and it would be reckless to make any comments.

<h3>Adopting Low-Altitude Bombing Tactics, German Air Raids on Britain Intensify; Twenty-Three Aircraft Shot Down in Two Days; British Prime Minister Inspects Defense and Nearly Meets an Accident</h3>
<p>London: The German air raids have intensified, and yesterday they even carried out large-scale killings and destruction in Britain. King George and Prime Minister Churchill also nearly met an accident, and were spared from bombs and machine gun bullets. In the previous twenty-five hours of air raids, twenty or thirty people were killed and hundreds were injured. Twenty-two German aircraft were shot down or damaged by British anti-aircraft guns and fighter jets. King George was inspecting the army in the eastern coastal area yesterday, and German aircraft were found in the sky at that time. During the air raid, the King and the British army did not have time to enter the air-raid shelter. Prime Minister Churchill was also inspecting coastal defenses yesterday, but when the German army bombed the defense zone, Wen immediately took refuge in the air-raid shelter. Now many German aircraft are using low-altitude bombing tactics, followed by intensive machine-gun扫射. Hundreds and thousands of shops, houses, government offices, and fields have been attacked and damaged by this new tactic. Yesterday, German aircraft frantically destroyed day and night. A certain town on the southeast coast, after many决's fierce bombing, has turned the prosperous trading area into a slaughterhouse. The personnel in charge of rescue work were excavating瓦砾 in the destroyed areas last night and this morning to find the bodies of the victims. It is generally believed that as a result of yesterday's air raid, the rate of casualties will inevitably increase significantly. After yesterday's large-scale air raid, a single German aircraft dropped eight bombs in the residential area of the same town, but no one was bombed to death, and only a few people were concussed. This morning, a German aircraft in a town in the southwest dropped six bombs in a residential area, and the houses were greatly damaged, but there were no casualties. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>London: British fighter jets and anti-aircraft guns have shot down more than ten German aircraft attacking Britain every day for three consecutive days. By noon on Thursday, twelve had been shot down. It was later confirmed that eight more were shot down last night, and several more were shot down this morning. Among them, four bombers were shot down off the east coast. Reuters learned from responsible sources that British fighter jets and anti-aircraft guns shot down no fewer than twenty-three German aircraft in various parts of Britain in the past twenty-four hours. At the same time, British aircraft penetrated deep into the Ruhr area during the day to attack warehouses. Last night, British aircraft re-entered Germany to attack military targets. All the aircraft that attacked during the day flew back, and three bombers attacking at night were missing. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>London: Twenty-four German aircraft flew over the southeastern coast of Britain last night and dropped fifteen high-explosive bombs. The public believed that four German aircraft were shot down at that time. When the German aircraft attacked, they briefly clashed with British aircraft and immediately turned around and flew into the sea. Finally, someone saw that the batch of German aircraft was being repeatedly attacked by British fighters. One German aircraft was shot down by anti-aircraft fire, and one of its crew members jumped out and parachuted into the sea. Also, seven German aircraft and Spitfire-style British aircraft engaged in combat over southeastern Britain. One enemy bomber crashed to the ground and was destroyed in a fire. Four crew members were rescued from the fire. The remaining German aircraft dropped three high-explosive bombs near the English Channel while being driven into the English Channel, all of which fell in the fields and were not damaged. Another two aircraft, believed to be German bombers, crashed into the sea about five miles away. After a town in the southeast was attacked, some civilians were killed and injured. One shell hit the emergency station, and the people in the station were bombed to death. Also, the hotel, bank and police station on the main street of a certain town were all destroyed, as if an earthquake had occurred. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>London: An Air Ministry communique stated that yesterday a large fleet of enemy bombers, protected by fighter jets, encountered fierce resistance when they attacked ships and other targets around the British coast. British fighter jets shot down twelve enemy aircraft and engaged with many enemy aircraft. One British fighter jet was lost. A British coastal aircraft shot down an enemy seaplane while patrolling in the sky over the English Channel. In addition, British Air Force bombers attacked bombing airfields and concentrated ships and other targets in the Netherlands and Belgium yesterday. One British aircraft was missing. On Wednesday, British bombers 画袭ed the Saint-Omer and Amiens airfields in France, and five British aircraft did not return. A coastal aircraft was also lost on patrol. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>London: The Air Ministry's Intelligence Department stated that British Air Force medium bombers attacked the Poix airfield in France at dawn. It is believed that five German aircraft have been destroyed and several others have been severely damaged. The ground defenses were caught off guard when the British aircraft突袭ed. Therefore, the anti-aircraft guns opened fire after the British aircraft dropped bombs and flew away. The first batch of British aircraft dropped several high-explosive bombs along one side of the airfield. Ten minutes later, twenty enemy aircraft parked behind the hangar were also attacked.

<h3>British Foreign Secretary Reports on the Near East Situation in the House of Lords, States British Naval Power in the Mediterranean is Strong, Able to Fulfill Promises to Allied Nations</h3>
<p>London - British Foreign Secretary Halifax stated in the House of Lords yesterday regarding the situation in the Near East that since Italy's entry into the war, Britain has never pressured Egypt to declare war on Italy. However, at the request of the Egyptian government, British troops stationed in Egypt have been greatly increased to prevent Italian aggression against Egypt. Britain intends to fulfill its obligation to protect Egypt. Egypt's independence and vital interests have been threatened by Italy's declaration of war on Britain. He was pleased to inform that the Egyptian people deeply understand that British and Egyptian interests are intertwined and inseparable, so they are suspicious of Italy's sweet words and are aware of the possibility of Italy invading Egyptian and Sudanese territory. Moreover, Italy's actions in Libya, Albania, and Abyssinia have not been forgotten, and the ambitions of totalitarian states prevent them from having illusions. The Italian Minister to Cairo is delaying his departure, and the enemy is spreading rumors that if Egypt abandons its treaty obligations, it can avoid the calamity of Italian troops pressing the border. Many responsible Egyptians believe that in these troubled times, for the benefit of the Egyptian people, there must be a stronger government to demonstrate its determination to fulfill treaty obligations. The British government, bearing the responsibility of protecting Egypt, also stated that Britain's opinion coincides with this. The situation in Palestine remains calm. Apart from occasional banditry, the whole territory is generally peaceful. The release of a large number of Arabs from prison is welcomed. People of all factions have strengthened their pro-British sentiments after Italy's entry into the war. While the Jews are fully cooperating with the British authorities in defense and emergency plans, the Arabs fear that Italy's colonization methods used in Libya will be applied to Palestine in the future, so they are also providing consistent cooperation to the British authorities.</p>
<p>Britain and Turkey still maintain very close ties. At the beginning of Italy's entry into the war, the Turkish Council of Ministers declared that Turkey would maintain a non-belligerent attitude. The British government deeply understands the circumstances under which the Turkish government made this decision, and the Turkish government has always maintained close contact with the British government. The Anglo-Turkish Treaty is still valid, and the loyal friendship and sympathy between the two peoples on which this treaty is based still exists. He hopes that this can be the basis for constructive cooperation between the two countries during the current war and in future peace. Although Germany is making every effort in the Balkans and the Near East to arouse unfounded doubts and fears, in the hope that countries will fall for its cunning schemes, he believes that the people there have plenty of experience with the methods of totalitarian states and will not be deceived into changing their belief in the principles for which we are striving. We now state that we have the ability to provide assistance and protection to our friends in the Near East and the Balkans. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>France Implements Dictatorial Political System, Marshal Pétain Appointed as Head of State, Administrative Power Concentrated in One Person, Government to Move to Versailles</h3>
<p>Vichy - The French government issued a decree last night, announcing Marshal Pétain as the Supreme Commander of France, bestowing upon him the title of "Head of the French State," and concurrently exercising the powers of the President and the Prime Minister. From now on, the administrative power of the French government will be completely concentrated in Marshal Pétain. All ministries will be responsible to Marshal Pétain and directly under his command. Marshal Pétain's authority can now independently cope with tense foreign situations and handle serious domestic conflicts. The Senate and the Chamber of Deputies will adjourn as soon as the new constitution is officially promulgated. In the future, only the Head of State can convene the two houses to meet. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>London - Swiss radio station Bollomminster said that Marshal Pétain had just signed an order to take over all the work previously handled by the President and Prime Minister of the Republic. Therefore, Lebrun, who had been President and head of France since 1933, was dismissed by Marshal Pétain. President Pétain also signed an order stipulating the powers of the head of state, which he will exercise in full cooperation with the government and various ministers and central administrators. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>New Constitution Stipulates the Powers of the Head of State</p>
<p>Vichy - Today's French government gazette published the new French constitution, stipulating the powers of the French Head of State as follows:</p>
<p>"Article 1" The great power of the government is entirely in the hands of the French Head of State. The Head of State appoints ministers, who are only responsible to the Head of State. (1) Before the new parliament is established, the Head of State exercises legislative power in the cabinet. (2) After the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies are established, in times of internal and external trouble and crises, the Head of State has the power to issue decrees regarding financial budgets and taxation. (3) The Head of State promulgates laws and regulations for implementation. (4) The Head of State appoints civil and military officials. (5) The Head of State controls the supreme military power of the country. (6) The Head of State exercises the power of amnesty. (7) The Head of State has the power to conduct diplomatic negotiations, approve treaties, and receive foreign envoys. (8) The Head of State has the power to declare martial law nationwide, or in part. (9) The Head of State has the power to declare war with the approval of parliament.</p>
<p>"Article 2" The French Constitution promulgated on February 25, 1875, and the French Constitution promulgated on July 16, 1875, are hereby repealed to the extent that they conflict with the new constitution. Signed by Pétain in Vichy on July 11, 1940. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>Pétain Delivers a Radio Address - Vichy - Marshal Pétain delivered a speech to the people on the radio last night, hinting at the enormous work that the government is currently facing. We only need to think about the refugees and supply problems in France and their scope. In the dark period when France was forced to yield to Germany, France's suffering continued. The British Navy has attacked the French Navy, its former ally. No matter what the reason, no justification can prove the rationality of this move. Britain claims that it had to take this measure to prevent the French fleet from falling into German and Italian hands. France has failed in this great war and has suffered new wounds. He needs the trust of all the French people, just as he has gained the trust of the French representatives. He will organize a new government. The administrative heads of the provinces should be changed to governors, appointed by the government. In view of the various matters to be dealt with, the French government has decided to move to Versailles, and the various cabinet departments will move back to Paris, that is, to the occupied territory. This request has now been submitted to the German government. This war has declared the collapse of international capitalism and international socialism. France has now broken away from all dark treaties and alliances and is completely isolated, but France will independently transform the French nation and French life with courage and fortitude. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>Parliamentary System Barely Survives</p>
<p>Vichy - According to the impressions gained by the special correspondent of Haitong News Agency from talking with French parliamentarians, the French parliamentary system has not been overthrown. At the same time, French political parties do not intend to dissolve themselves. Both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies will continue to exist until new houses are produced in accordance with the new constitution, after which they will be dissolved. Although most of the French parliamentarians in Vichy have passed a resolution authorizing Prime Minister Pétain to draft a new constitution, they still hope that the two houses can participate in the drafting of the new constitution. The various political parties are also not prepared to dissolve themselves. Assistant Laval is currently advocating the organization of a single political party, but this proposal has been cancelled due to opposition from various parties. The younger parliamentarians generally do not believe that Pétain, Weygand, Laval, and Magne are figures who can revive France, so they collectively call them the "New Leaders."

<h3>Naval Battle in the Mediterranean Underway, Italian Troops Launch a Large-Scale Offensive in East Africa, British Troops Surrounded in Moyale</h3>
<p>Rome - Today's Italian military bulletin stated that the Anglo-Italian naval and air war in the Mediterranean, which began this week, is still ongoing today. Italian aircraft continued to bomb the vicinity of Malta, sinking one ship and destroying two destroyers. A British aircraft carrier was also burned by Italian air force bombing. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>London - Today, the Italian official bulletin broadcast by Rome Radio stated that when Italian aircraft attacked the British fleet in the Mediterranean, a large bomb hit an aircraft carrier, a ship in the convoy sank, and two destroyers were severely damaged. The bulletin also stated that Italian aircraft saw the aircraft carrier catch fire after being hit, and other ships went to rescue it. The attacked British fleet was said to consist of two battleships, one aircraft carrier, several smaller warships, and five large ships escorting fully loaded ships, sailing east near Malta. Officials in London have denied the above news. According to news received here, one Italian aircraft was shot down, and one British fighter plane could not fly again after landing. There were no other losses. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Nairobi - A British outpost in Moyale, on the border between Abyssinia and Kenya, was surrounded by a large number of Italian troops at dawn on Wednesday. However, it is still holding firm. The British side has dispatched troops to reinforce it. According to the communiqué, the Italian army has fired more than 1,000 shells at it, but so far there have been few casualties. The communiqué also stated that yesterday morning, three Italian Caproni bombers dropped many bombs in Moyale, causing very little damage. Three British aircraft took off to intercept them, shooting down one of them, and the engine of another was also seen to catch fire. All British aircraft safely returned to their bases.

<h3>Britain Seeks to Improve Relations with the Soviet Union, Hope of Success Gradually Apparent, Butler Answers Questions from Parliamentarians</h3>
<p>London - The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Butler, was asked in the British House of Commons yesterday whether he could sincerely acknowledge the claim in the German White Paper that Britain intended to directly attack the Baku oil fields, and declare to the House of Commons that the British government's policy was to improve and consolidate Anglo-Soviet relations. Butler replied that the British government's policy had always been to improve and strengthen Anglo-Soviet relations. This policy had shown promise of success after March of this year, when the Soviet Union made friendly contacts with the British government, intending to resume trade negotiations. This was a welcome departure from the unfriendly attitude adopted by the Soviet Union after the breakdown of political negotiations in August of last year. The British government immediately agreed to it, and hopes that the discussions currently being conducted by the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Cripps, can ultimately eliminate the danger that some people fear, that the Soviet government will work for Germany economically and militarily to the detriment of Britain. Since the outbreak of the war, the British government has been preventing this danger when formulating military plans. The General Staff must of course consider how to respond to Soviet assistance to Germany. Apart from military assistance, the most valuable assistance that the Soviet Union could give to Germany would be to supply Germany with oil from the Caucasus. It is the responsibility of the General Staff to study whether, under certain circumstances, it is possible to interfere with the production of Caucasian oil. However, the British government has never sought the cooperation or tacit consent of Turkey or Iran in this hypothetical plan. He hopes that these remarks can dispel the false and harmful impressions that German propaganda seeks to create. (Reuters, 12th)</p>

<h3>Balkan Situation Tense, Turkey Takes Precautionary Measures, Prime Minister to Deliver Speech Clarifying Attitude Towards Europe, Soviet Union Denies Demands for Turkey to Cede Territory</h3>
<p>Ankara - Turkish affairs took a sharp turn yesterday. The news that the military authorities in the Istanbul district summoned cavalry and soldiers on sick leave between the ages of twenty and thirty-eight from the 17th grade to return to their teams today had just spread, and the report that members of the People's Party (i.e., the ruling party) were summoned to a meeting at 10:00 yesterday morning followed. Yesterday afternoon, the gazette stated that Prime Minister Saydam reported on the situation and political events of the past few days. His speech was long, and the coalition party unanimously supported it. What was discussed at the meeting yesterday was clearly focused on Turkish-Soviet relations. Although political circles have not yet acknowledged the claim that the Soviet side submitted the Amedet letter, Turkish-Soviet relations now seem to be gradually crystallizing. The most notable is the Soviet Union's desire for its warships to be able to freely cross the Dardanelles Strait. Judging from recent newspaper propaganda, it would not be surprising if the Soviet Union wanted to amend the Montreux Convention, which grants Turkey the right to prohibit warships from crossing this strait. Turkey's attitude can be seen in the official declaration to be issued today. According to people here, the Axis powers seem to be trying to lure the Soviet Union to divert its attention from the Balkans and focus on Turkey and the Near East, so they are quite dissatisfied with Germany for interfering in Turkish affairs. Turkish newspapers are increasingly criticizing Germany's attempts to alienate Turkey and the Soviet Union. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Moscow - Recently, foreign newspapers have spread rumors that the Soviet Union has demanded that Turkey cede territory. TASS has recently been officially authorized to state that these rumors are pure fabrication and completely inconsistent with the facts. (TASS, 12th)</p>
<p>Ankara - The public is paying great attention to the declaration to be delivered by Prime Minister Saydam in the National Assembly this afternoon. It is expected that Saydam will declare that Turkey abhors the Axis powers' efforts to cause disputes between it and the Soviet Union. Although Turkey currently has no possibility of French assistance, it seems confident that it can resist all unfair demands and is determined to do so.</p>
<p>It is heard that Saydam's remarks will be delivered in strong and forceful terms and are likely to cause a deep impression abroad. As for the Soviet Union's official denial of Germany's claim that the Soviet Union sent the Amedet letter to the Turkish government, this has satisfied Turkey. British Foreign Secretary Halifax's remarks in the House of Lords on Wednesday night regarding Anglo-Turkish relations were also warmly welcomed here. German Ambassador to Turkey Papen has returned to Ankara to maintain contact with political developments. Turkey is now indignant at the conspiracies of the German diplomatic community, who have spread various rumors in the past week, such as the Soviet Union will make demands on Turkey, the Anglo-Turkish Treaty will be officially abolished, Turkey will ask for German protection, and Istanbul will be ceded to the Soviet Union. These rumors have aroused strong criticism from Turkish newspapers, and political circles are also indignant. Today's denial by the Soviet Union and Prime Minister Saydam's speech seem to make it clear to the general public, and even to German diplomats, that Germany's efforts to intimidate Turkey or to poison Soviet-Turkish relations have failed. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>London - Foreign Secretary Halifax met with Soviet Ambassador Maisky yesterday to discuss the general situation. According to diplomatic sources here, the talks were quite "harmonious." The two sides exchanged views on the Balkan Peninsula, especially the issue of the Turkish Dardanelles Strait. On this issue, Ambassador Maisky did not seem to explain anything concretely, but judging from his general expression, it was quite reassuring. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<h3>Romanian Foreign Minister Announces Foreign Policy, Decides to Strengthen Political Relations with Germany, Romania and Bulgaria Begin Negotiations to Adjust Friendship</h3>
<p>Bucharest - Romanian Foreign Minister Manolescu declared to press representatives yesterday that the redetermination of Romania's foreign policy will be proven by concrete facts. Romania's withdrawal from the League of Nations is the initial step in this new policy. Romania is determined to sever relations with the past. We are determined to strengthen political relations with Germany and create a new era of permanent friendly cooperation between Germany and Romania. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>Sofia - Bulgarian political figures said yesterday that preliminary negotiations to adjust friendly relations between Bulgaria and Romania have now begun. Bulgarian figures believe that the new Romanian cabinet will be more understanding of Bulgaria's demands than its predecessor. The Gigurtu cabinet had expressed its intention to compromise on the issue of Dobruja. It is understood that the preliminary negotiations between Bulgaria and Romania have a high hope of ending satisfactorily, but the Bulgarian government has not yet confirmed that Bulgaria and Romania have begun negotiations. However, one thing to note is that Bulgarian newspapers have stopped publishing rebuttals of Romania since yesterday. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>Sofia - Former Bulgarian Prime Minister Shaukov issued a booklet yesterday, solemnly declaring that Bulgaria should demand Dobruja and access to the Aegean Sea, and pointed out that this demand cannot be fulfilled without the sympathy and assistance of Germany. Shaukov also elaborated on the need for cooperation between the Soviet Union and Germany. Since Bulgaria is one of the small countries, its policies should be appropriate to the interests of the great powers. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>Romanian Government Issues New Order to Control Oil Industry Stocks</p>
<p>Bucharest - The government has issued a new order to control the stocks of Romanian oil companies, stipulating that all shares must be registered within 30 days, and detailed information must be reported to the Minister of National Economy. Shares held overseas must be represented by diplomatic and consular personnel, specifying the date and place of purchase by the holders. In the future, the transfer of these shares cannot take effect without the permission of the Romanian Special Committee now established. Some parties believe that this order is the first step towards nationalization. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>Hungarian Prime Minister Publishes Impressions of Visiting Germany</h3>
<p>Budapest - After returning to Budapest yesterday, Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki told the press about his impressions of visiting Germany, saying, "My Foreign Minister and I had a very good impression of our trip to Germany. When the German Head of State received us, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was also present. Italy was represented by Foreign Minister Ciano. The German Head of State, in his struggle for the survival of Germany and his experiment in stepping into a new powerful country, was willing to sacrifice his precious time to listen to our presentation and to learn about Hungary's important issues, which we deeply appreciated. In a two-hour and forty-five-minute conversation, the Foreign Minister and I presented various issues. The Head of State listened attentively and expressed great sympathy for the various issues. Regarding this point, the last sentence of the official communiqué can prove that the Axis powers all want to sincerely create a situation in all parts of Europe as a basis for permanent peace." (Haitong News Agency, 12th)</p>
<h3>Supreme Soviet of the Karelo-Finnish Republic Passes Constitution</h3>
<p>Moscow - At its first session, the Supreme Soviet of the Karelo-Finnish Republic examined and passed the code governing the election of Soviet representatives from the cities, towns, and villages of the republic. At the same time, regulations regarding the determination of the borders between the Karelo-Finnish Republic and the Russian Federation were also passed. The conference also elected Kuusinen as Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Karelo-Finnish Republic. Furthermore, it reported that when the Supreme Soviet of the Karelo-Finnish Republic held a conference on the 9th, Kuusinen reported on the drafting process of the republic's constitution, solemnly declaring that a certain article of the constitution had recognized that the Finnish and Russian languages occupied an equal important position in the republic. It is said that "this regulation can enable the people of the Karelo-Finnish Republic to reach the highest peak in culture." Other deputies who participated in the debate also unanimously agreed that the draft constitution was satisfactory and recognized that the draft was indeed in conformity with the Stalin Constitution. After discussion, the conference unanimously passed the entire constitution. (TASS, 11th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Naval Maneuvers in the Baltic Sea Completed</h3>
<p>London - News received here yesterday from Moscow Radio stated that the Soviet Baltic Fleet had held naval maneuvers in the Baltic Sea for three days, during which large-scale naval battles were practiced. All battleships, cruisers, destroyers, high-speed speedboats, submarines, and aircraft participated. The naval maneuvers were completed yesterday. It is decided that the naval maneuvers may be held on Soviet Navy Day. (United Press)</p>
<h3>Britain and Germany Engage in Diplomatic Struggle over the Pan-American Conference, U.S. Secretary of State Hull Makes a Statement, Accusing Germany of Threatening Latin America, British Ministry of Economic Warfare Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Washington - Secretary of State Hull yesterday denounced Germany's warning to Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Nicaragua not to join the Pan-American Conference in acts of "non-neutrality." Hull believes that this is a means of intimidation by Germany, attempting to undermine the sovereignty of the Central American republics. At the same time, it is heard that Britain's proposal to the United States to organize an economic alliance of the Western Hemisphere under American supervision, not to sell military supplies to Germany, Italy, and Japan, has been shelved by the United States. According to Britain's proposal, all twenty-one republics of the Americas would become the backbone of Britain's blockade policy, and it may cause these countries to go to war with Japan. Officials here believe that Britain and Germany are fighting a fierce first round of fighting on the diplomatic front, both trying to use the Pan-American Conference to prevent their opponents from obtaining raw materials from Latin America. American diplomats are now trying to counter any attacks from Germany, that is, to point out to the governments of Latin American countries that all countries in the Americas must unite in order not to be crushed by German economic power. According to Hull's denunciation of Germany, it was due to reports that German Minister to Panama Reinbeck had made this statement. Someone asked Hull to comment on Reinbeck's move. Hull replied, "The Pan-American Conference was unanimously approved by the twenty-one republics of the Americas. The matters discussed are only related to these twenty-one countries. Reinbeck's warning seems to be a means of intimidation. It should be known that the sovereignty and freedom of action of the countries subject to this intimidation should be respected and are no different from those of other countries. No legal theory can defend an attack on this sovereignty." Authoritative sources said that the shelving of the British proposal does not hinder the conference's handling of this case. At least Britain can fulfill part of its wishes. It is also heard that Britain is now planning to launch an anti-totalitarian trade boycott in Latin America, and the United States is currently not opposed to its efforts. (International News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>Washington - Secretary of State Hull met with reporters yesterday and, when referring to the activities of the German Minister to the five Central American republics, Reinbeck, said that Germany clearly intends to exert various threats on the Latin American countries. Reports say that Reinbeck, regarding the upcoming Pan-American Conference, "warned" the Central American governments not to engage in actions aimed at directly or indirectly opposing Germany. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>London - The Ministry of Economic Warfare recently issued an article on the issue of discussing American surplus products at the Pan-American Conference convened in Havana, Cuba, on July 20, stating that if Japan remains neutral, Britain has no intention of interfering with its legitimate trade. What concerns Britain about this Pan-American Conference is to prevent supplies from being transported to Germany, Italy, or the countries occupied by German forces. It is rumored that Britain's blockade of Germany and Italy also includes Japan. This statement is inaccurate because Japan is a neutral country. Although the conference in Havana is not related to the issue of blockade, if goods shipped out of the United States are transported to enemy countries or enemy-occupied countries, they will be intercepted by the British contraband control station. Germany is now imposing a blockade on Britain, so any British blockade measures must not be relaxed slightly, otherwise it will only prolong the war. The problem of American surplus products has been exacerbated by the war. Britain is willing to cooperate with it to study possible solutions to this problem. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>US Democratic Party Drafts Election Platform: Roosevelt Decides to Participate in Election</h3>
<p>Chicago - Amidst general uncertainty about President Roosevelt's willingness to run for a third term, leaders of the US Democratic Party have recently begun drafting the Democratic Party's 1940 election platform. It is said that this platform will not only attempt to reconcile with isolationists but also with conservative Democrats who oppose the New Deal. The Democratic National Convention will be held here on Monday, with over 3,000 delegates attending and a total of 1,094 votes. Representative Bankhead from Alabama, who is participating in the vice-presidential campaign, will deliver an important speech on Monday evening. Senator Barkley from Kentucky, also hoping to be selected as vice president, will deliver a speech on Tuesday evening. The Democratic platform is expected to be submitted for discussion and passage on Wednesday. The election of candidates will begin on Thursday. At that time, in addition to President Roosevelt's name, several other names will certainly be announced. However, today, much attention is being paid here to whether President Roosevelt will be nominated again. This sentiment is unavoidable while candidates are yet to be selected. Last night, some insisted on presenting Vice President Garner's name to the convention, regardless of President Roosevelt's decision to participate in a third campaign. Garner's name will be put forward by Garner's old friends Moro, Houston, and Baker of Texas, unless President Roosevelt indicates his willingness to participate in a third campaign. Senator Wheeler of Montana will also be nominated. Chairman Farley of the Democratic National Committee has also agreed to have his name put forward, but with reservations. Furthermore, according to rumors in Washington, President Roosevelt will announce his intentions within the next 24 hours. However, other rumors suggest that President Roosevelt will remain silent until the convention election begins, at which point he will announce his intentions to the delegates. (United Press dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Washington - US Secretary of the Interior Ickes claimed last night that there is no doubt that President Roosevelt will participate in the third presidential election. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3>Vulnerability of the Suez Canal</h3>
<p>Before the outbreak of the European War, regardless of day or night, summer or winter, a ship would pass through the Suez Canal's entrance and exit every eighty-two minutes at an astonishing speed, sounding its horn. The ship's time is most precious, so it cannot stop. Ships use the Suez Canal to save time, and any delay would diminish the value of the Suez Canal's existence. One hundred and twenty pilots who speak various languages are always on call.</p>
<p>The Suez Canal Company is responsible for the safety of every arriving ship. At night, searchlights are installed, and helmsmen and chief mates are sent on board to guide the ship, just as a trained nurse gives a baby a bottle.</p>
<p>The canal has a total of thirteen bends. If a ship accidentally crashes into one of these bends, it would be like a cork stuck in a bottle, halting all traffic for a week. However, year after year, this has never happened, proving the perfection of the organization.</p>
<p>The waterway managed by the company is one hundred and fourteen miles long. From Port Said to Suez is only one hundred and six miles, but due to the shallowness of the coast, the Mediterranean side requires six miles of dredged waterway, and the Red Sea side requires two miles. The channel originally excavated by the Frenchman Lesseps was through plains and sand, and did not present any engineering problems. The entire route utilized three natural depressions: Lake Manzala (27 miles), Lake Timsah (7 miles), and two other saltwater lakes (20 miles). Another section was the Demietta Canal, half of whose construction was successful. There are no rock layers along the canal. The Mediterranean Sea is only ten inches lower than the Red Sea, and there are practically no tides at either end. A freshwater canal branching from the Nile flows into Lake Timsah, so three different types of water mix in the main Suez Canal channel.</p>
<p>The main task of the Suez Canal Authority is to dredge the sediment discharged by the Nile that accumulates in its delta. The rivers of Egypt, like China's Yellow River and America's Mississippi River, can be described as rivers with a lot of sediment. The mouth of the Nile at Damietta is only twenty-five miles from the west entrance of the canal. The prevailing wind direction on the Mediterranean side is from the northwest, and the entire sea current along the southern coast of the Mediterranean also flows from west to east. The sediment from the river creates shoals along the coast, blocking the entrance to the Suez Canal.</p>
<p>To maintain a standard depth of thirty-seven feet, the Suez Canal Company has adopted two engineering plans. One is to build dikes to prevent sediment-laden currents from approaching the coast. The other is to continuously dredge the waterway to maintain its depth. These dikes extend outwards from Port Said, with three miles protruding above the water and another two miles below the water.</p>
<p>When the canal was first dug, the width of the canal bottom was sixty-five feet. However, due to changes over time, the wooden sailing ships of Lesseps' era have now been replaced by larger iron steamships. Therefore, the Suez Canal Company had to keep pace with the progress of modern shipbuilding. Currently, the width of the canal bottom has reached one hundred and eighty feet, and the width of the canal surface has reached four hundred and fifty feet. Two large ships with beam widths of eighty-five feet can pass each other comfortably. However, to prevent accidents, strict regulations have been put in place: one ship must stop, and the other must reduce its speed to five miles per hour. The original depth of twenty-five feet has also been increased to thirty-seven feet.</p>
<p>The faster the ships travel, the greater the resistance and the more violent the waves they generate. If a ship travels at its normal speed, the waves it generates will first damage the banks on both sides. The Suez Canal Company has therefore set a rule limiting ships with a draft of thirty feet to a speed of nine miles per hour.</p>
<p>Large ships have relatively small rudders, which allow them to have a wide turning angle in the open ocean. However, in a narrow waterway, a wide turning angle is extremely inconvenient. A speed of nine miles per hour eliminates the freedom to steer, further preventing them from turning. Therefore, safely guiding magnificent liners to the vast ocean is proof of the excellent skills of the Suez Canal pilots.</p>
<p>Although the Suez Canal Company is purely a commercial enterprise, its commercial capacity depends on external politics. External events, such as one government sending a note to another government, can cause the Suez Canal's stock to fall. The long-term decline in stock prices occurred in 1872, when people were still generally doubtful about the success of the project. The long-term rise in stock prices occurred in 1937, following the signing of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, with shareholders seeing the price rise from fifty dollars to one thousand two hundred dollars per share. In 1935, when Italy invaded Abyssinia, the League of Nations implemented sanctions, and British Members of Parliament demanded the closure of the Suez Canal, the stock price fell to five hundred dollars. The price of Suez Canal stock can almost be used as a barometer of political trends.</p>
<p>The Suez Canal Company's concession ends in November 1968, when the land lease for the canal zone expires. This makes permanent improvements inconvenient, because after twenty-eight years, they may not recoup their investment. Also, because of uncertainty about the future, there are some difficulties in maintaining the canal's current engineering.</p>
<p>After the expiration of the lease, the canal will be unconditionally returned to King Farouk of Egypt or his successors. In November 1968, the Egyptian government may choose one of the following three options: (1) Purchase the company's assets at a fair price, making the business the property of the Egyptian government. Egyptian students and intellectuals have long passionately shouted the slogan "Eliminate all foreigners and foreign capital" and put the canal under Egyptian management. (2) The Egyptian government could lease it to a new company, with Japanese, German, and Italian interests as its main members. In this case, the Egyptian government could earn a large amount of rent. (3) The Egyptian government could lease it to the original company, extending the lease, increasing the rent, or increasing profits, and increasing the number of representatives on the board of directors.</p>
<p>From the general observation of people, if the current chairman of the company, Vogel, can reach a secret agreement with the Egyptian King beforehand, it will certainly enable the third choice to achieve its goal. If the amount of money is the decisive factor, then no other group has such financial strength. The excellent technical services and strong financial power of the company will surely give it a winning chance in holding the priority. In addition, some people believe that Britain will also exert great pressure on the contracting party to seek the establishment of a new treaty. Although the concession still has twenty-eight years to run, rumors are rife that some countries have allowed large sums of money to be used for acquisition activities.</p>

<h3>Anglo-American-Soviet Cooperation as a Factor in Stabilizing the Far East; American Foreign Policy Association Advocates Full US-Soviet Cooperation; Woodhead Suggests American Naval Deployment to the East</h3>
<p>Recently, the situation in the Pacific has suddenly become tense. The complex relationships between Britain, the United States, Japan, and the Soviet Union indicate an increasingly delicate situation. The British authorities resolutely rejected Japan's request to blockade the Burma Road and implemented preparations to evacuate women and children from Hong Kong, ready to resist foreign aggression by force. The tension between Britain and Japan can be imagined. At the same time, after the July 7th Incident, and the incident where US Marines arrested 16 Japanese armed plainclothes military police within the defense zone, the Japanese deliberately magnified the severity of the incident and launched an anti-American movement in the Hongkou district, posting slogans and holding meetings everywhere, advocating the use of force against the United States. Although US-Japan relations are unlikely to break down due to this local incident, animosity between the two sides is unavoidable.</p>
<p>US-Soviet Cooperation Expected to Materialize</p>
<p>Therefore, the American Foreign Policy Association, recognizing that the threat of Japanese aggression cannot be ignored, has strongly advocated for it. A foreign newspaper editorial stated that this suggestion is very likely to materialize.</p>
<p>Effective Suggestions from Mr. Woodhead</p>
<p>According to the opinion of the famous British commentator Mr. Woodhead, the United States' naval presence in Honolulu indicates its determination not to abandon its interests in East Asia. He further mentioned the precautionary measures taken by the Hong Kong authorities, indicating the possibility of a Japanese attack on Hong Kong, and clarified the British authorities' determination to resist. Finally, he suggested that the US and British authorities could establish an agreement to transfer a portion of the US Navy to Singapore as a way to prevent the Japanese from advancing southward. This move by the United States is purely to safeguard its interests and maintain the status quo in the Pacific, and Japan should not use it as an excuse to object.</p>
<p>Soviet Policy Remains Consistent</p>
<p>The focus of the above two perspectives is to curb the Japanese expansionist ambitions. The development of the Pacific situation in this direction is clearly beneficial to China's resistance against Japan. The reporter also inquired with people in this city close to Soviet diplomatic circles about the Soviet Union's attitude towards China's resistance against Japan. They responded that the Soviet Union's policy towards China has always been consistent. As stated by Mr. Molotov, Chairman of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, the Soviet people unanimously sympathize with China's heroic resistance. China's continued resistance will surely achieve final victory.</p>
<p>Embargo on Yunnan-Burma Road Not Justified</p>
<p>Yesterday, the "North China Daily News" published a letter from a reader stating that the Japanese government and its domestic newspapers have expressed great dissatisfaction with the British government's rejection of their request to embargo the Yunnan-Burma Road. However, on the other hand, we only need to closely observe the ships operated by the Japanese in their "occupied areas" to see that some war necessities are continuously transported from Siberia to Germany by the Japanese, and this has not stopped to this day. As far as we know, the British government has not protested to the Japanese because the latter is, after all, a neutral country, and its transportation is not subject to British supervision, so it cannot be prohibited from doing so. Based on the same situation, Britain, in the same capacity, can transport munitions to China via the Yunnan-Burma Road. Moreover, Japan has not officially declared war on China. After Japan declares war on China, it can use its naval power to detain ships, but such measures are illegal.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow is French National Day; Due to the Current Situation, No Extravagant Celebrations</h3>
<p>Tomorrow is the 151st anniversary of the storming of the Bastille prison by the revolutionary masses of Paris, which led to the founding of the French Republic. In previous years, the French expatriate community in Shanghai would hold celebratory ceremonies as a matter of routine. The authorities would hold grand banquets and gatherings every July 14th. Various police stations and the French Concession fire brigade would hang electric lanterns and decorations to celebrate the National Day. This year, due to the current situation, they do not want to be too extravagant. A reporter from "New Voice News" learned from relevant sources that, in addition to flying flags to mark the occasion, there will be no other activities. A luncheon or dinner may be held at the French Chamber of Commerce at 7 pm to celebrate. At that time, French Ambassador Cosme and his wife, French Consul-General Eugene, and others will attend. The ambassador's private residence, Hague House, may host staff. The French expatriates and their friends in Shanghai will hold banquets and celebrations to commemorate the martyrs. It was not easy to establish it. On July 14, 1789, one hundred and fifty-one years ago, the revolutionary masses of Paris captured the Bastille prison, creating the Republican celebration and establishing a model for modern democratic nations. Although there were setbacks at that time, they finally relied on an indomitable spirit to overthrow the monarchy and create today's National Day.</p>
<h3>Japanese Claim to Have Purchased the Munitions Aboard the "Shengjing" Steamer; No Response from the French Garrison in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The French military munitions transported from Tianjin on the Taikoo "Shengjing" steamer were automatically transported away by Japanese barges the day before yesterday. Regarding rumors of confiscation, according to Japanese claims, the munitions have been purchased. However, there has been no response from the French garrison in Shanghai, so it is impossible to know how the Japanese and French are negotiating. After unloading the munitions, the "Shengjing" steamer sailed into Songkou and docked at Pier No. 1 of the Bund in the French Concession to unload cargo. It is said that there is a lot of cargo. It was originally scheduled to depart for Tianjin today, but because of the delay in loading and unloading, it has been changed to tomorrow (Sunday) at 10 am. However, according to a Japanese naval spokesman at a reception for journalists last night, the munitions unloaded from the "Shengjing" steamer on Tuesday (the 9th) will be temporarily kept by the Japanese military. The spokesman continued that the protest against the ship for not heeding the order to stop and presenting it to the British naval authorities is currently under peaceful discussion between the two authorities.</p>
<h3>Seeking a Resolution to the Incident of the Arrest of Japanese Military Police; Japanese Military Officers Visit Colonel Baker Twice; Provide a More Detailed Explanation of the Incident</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of sixteen Japanese military police officers arrested in the US military defense zone on the third anniversary of the July 7th Resistance, Japanese newspapers and expatriates have made a big fuss. However, the attitude of the Japanese officials has gradually eased. The US military authorities, believing that the fault does not lie with them, have consistently remained indifferent and calm. Although the issue has not been resolved, the tension has gradually eased. Colonel Baker's reply to the Japanese Military Police Headquarters was delivered to the Japanese side on the 10th. However, the Japanese side believes that this reply is mostly "unresponsive to the question," so it is necessary to provide a detailed explanation to the US Navy Fourth Regiment.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 12th: A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry reiterated today while hosting foreign reporters that he hoped that the accidental incident between the US Marines and Japanese military police in Shanghai could be resolved locally, saying that the matter has been left to the Shanghai Japanese authorities for negotiation.</p>
<p>Two Visits for Detailed Explanation</p>
<p>Therefore, on Thursday (the 11th), two Japanese military officers were specially dispatched to visit Colonel Baker to explain the actual situation at the time of the incident. However, Colonel Baker was busy with official duties and did not grant a long conversation opportunity. Yesterday morning, the Japanese military officers visited the headquarters of the US Navy Fourth Regiment on Hardoon Road again to provide a detailed explanation to a certain US official. The official promised to relay the details to Colonel Baker.</p>
<p>Japanese Newspapers Exaggerate the Situation</p>
<p>According to a Japanese military spokesman at a reception for Western reporters yesterday, the actual detailed circumstances at the time of the incident are not fully known to the outside world. He did not want to criticize this matter too much. Yesterday's Japanese "Continental New Daily" published a "grand theory" on this case with a large amount of space, stating that this incident not only affects the prestige of the "Imperial Army" but also affects the honor and dignity of the entire Japanese nation. If this issue is not resolved appropriately and quickly, its impact on Japan's domestic political situation and foreign relations will be very serious, because the place where this incident occurred is Shanghai, a port to which international attention is attached.</p>
<p>Official Attitude Shows Caution</p>
<p>It is said that our country (Japan) authorities, with the support of all Japanese expatriates in Shanghai, are still taking a cautious attitude, hoping that the US Navy will take appropriate action on this case. However, the caution of our country (Japan) authorities should be limited. Therefore, if the US Navy delays in replying to the protest of the Military Police Commander Miura, our country authorities must take their final decision. This is a matter of course.</p>
<p>Tokyo Rhetoric Fuels the Flames</p>
<p>United Press International, Tokyo, 12th: Tokyo's "Nichinichi Shimbun" today demanded that the Japanese government adopt a "tit-for-tat, knife-for-knife" policy to resolve the incident between the US Marines and Japanese military police in Shanghai. The newspaper claimed that adopting this policy would not only prevent the occurrence of similar incidents but also resolve disputes. The newspaper pointed out two of the most meaningful elements of the Shanghai incident: one is that the incident occurred in Shanghai, where the Japanese flag has a dominant advantage; the second is that this happened because of the uncivilized US Marines, under the protection of the public concession.</p>
<h3>Japanese Misappropriation of Customs Revenue Reaches 200 Million; Britain Has a Responsibility to Recover the Large Sum of Money</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the customs revenue of various ports has inevitably decreased compared to before due to tax evasion by unscrupulous merchants and the influx of inferior goods. However, the monthly income is still 8 million to 12-13 million yuan. Therefore, the average daily tax revenue of the Jianghai Customs is about 1 million yuan. Since the Anglo-Japanese Customs Agreement, although it is nominally deposited in the Mercantile Bank, it is actually no different from depositing it in the Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank. According to reporters from the "Ping Ming News Agency" who have reliable sources, the daily tax revenue of the Jianghai Customs, collected by the Yokohama Specie Bank and previously transferred to it, has so far accumulated to at least 200 million yuan. Among them, a considerable portion is used by the Japanese in the black market of this city to purchase foreign exchange. However, the Anglo-Japanese Customs Agreement stipulates that this customs revenue cannot be used for Japanese misappropriation. If there are any defaults in the future, the British Mercantile Bank should be responsible for recovering this huge amount of tax revenue. Therefore, the British side should at least investigate this amount with the Yokohama Specie Bank and prevent it from being further misappropriated. Because there are accurate account books for this large sum of money in the Jianghai Customs, it should be liquidated and returned to the original owner in the future.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Contribute the Most to the War of Resistance, Remitting Huge Sums of Money; Donate 600 Million and Purchase Government Bonds for 1.1 Billion; Government's International Balance of Payments Depends on It</h3>
<p>Since the successive fall of the wealthy coastal provinces, remittances from overseas Chinese have been a major source of financial support for the National Government's War of Resistance. According to the French "Political and Economic News," based on reports from overseas Chinese, since the Sino-Japanese Incident, overseas Chinese have remitted 600 million yuan back to the country to support the War of Resistance and purchased 1.1 billion yuan of government bonds. The "Japan Times" also has detailed records of this. According to reports, in peacetime, overseas Chinese remittances to China are about 30 million yuan per year, mostly from overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, which is a major factor in balancing China's international trade. The 10 million overseas Chinese abroad suffer from harsh treatment from foreign authorities, so their patriotic sentiment is particularly strong. Whenever the motherland suffers from internal and external troubles, they dedicate their lives and property to the country without hesitation. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary success was greatly helped by overseas Chinese in spirit and strength. Since the Kuomintang came to power, the assistance of overseas Chinese has never decreased. The Chinese government has relied heavily on the assistance of overseas Chinese in quelling internal unrest. Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, the exact amount of funds donated by overseas Chinese to support Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's War of Resistance is unknown, but according to those who have been published, there are donations from the following places:</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies donated 5,073,418 yuan in legal tender and 219,568 yuan in Hong Kong dollars. Overseas Chinese in British Borneo donated 897,896 yuan in Hong Kong dollars. From July 1937 to March 1940, the total amount of donations from overseas Chinese reached 600 million yuan, of which approximately 68.5 million yuan was remitted by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission.</p>
<p>The largest donors are the overseas Chinese in Singapore and the Dutch East Indies. The 24 provinces under the rule of the National Government have lost 11 provinces, but the finances can still be maintained, and the assistance of overseas Chinese is the main reason. The amount of government bonds underwritten by overseas Chinese is even more significant, reaching as much as 1,116,188,451 yuan.</p>
<h3>German Embassy's Reception for Reporters Changed to Once Every Two Weeks</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency Special Report from this City: The information officer of the German Embassy in China usually hosts Chinese and foreign reporters in Shanghai every Thursday. Due to the hot weather, it has been changed to once every two weeks. The location is the German Building at No. 1 Dashilu. In addition to tea and snacks, films about the recent European war are shown. In case of special events, reporters from various newspapers are invited to hold a meeting. The time for the next reception is 5 pm on July 25th, and the location is No. 1 Dashilu.</p>
<h3>After a Large Number of Stamps Arrive in Shanghai, Usage Should Be Restored</h3>
<p>After a large number of national government stamp tax tickets were shipped to Shanghai on the 26th of last month, all industries have been purchasing and affixing them. Many enthusiastic people refuse to accept receipts that do not have stamps affixed to them, in order to emphasize national tax. It is learned that there are still a few merchants who are still using the excuse that "post offices have stopped selling them and there is no way to purchase and affix them" to evade national tax. Relevant authorities have now dispatched personnel to various businesses to conduct a thorough investigation. All ledgers, bankbooks, and other documents and books that should have stamps affixed to them will be reported to the Special District Local Court if there is any omission, and they will be punished according to law. The authorities also hope that all customers and merchants will report those who evade affixing stamps as much as possible. It is also learned that counterfeit stamps have been discovered recently, and it is difficult to distinguish them at first glance. Therefore, for the sake of caution, all industries should directly purchase goods from the stamp sales agent of the North Sichuan Road Postal Administration to avoid being fooled.</p>
<h3>British Embassy Denies Evacuation of Overseas Nationals from Shanghai; The News Reported by White Russian Newspapers Has No Basis</h3>
<p>According to various Japanese and Russian newspapers in this city, the British Embassy and Consulate in this city have recently issued a notice saying that the British authorities are preparing to evacuate British women, children, and various goods from Shanghai. The British Embassy in China recently denied this and said that the news has no basis.</p>

<h3>A Hurricane May Strike Shanghai; Customs Hangs Ball Warning; The Wind is Strong and Moving Quickly Towards Shanghai</h3>
<p>A second new hurricane will strike Shanghai. At 3:30 pm yesterday, the Customs received a report from the Observatory that the hurricane originating from Komissima Island (transliteration) had reached 26.5 degrees north latitude and 127.5 degrees east longitude yesterday, still within 60 miles. The wind is quite strong and moving north-northwest. It is said that it may strike Shanghai, so the Customs hung a black ball on the flagpole on the roof of the clock tower at 4:53 pm yesterday (Customs clock) and changed to a red light at night to indicate a warning, so that ships on the Huangpu River could take precautions. However, the weather was still clear last night. The Gaodeng and Shantai ships were going to Ningbo yesterday. The Gaodeng ship still departed with passengers as usual after the Customs hung the ball warning. However, the Customs had no export report. It is said that the Shantai ship has stopped leaving Shanghai. Today, the Taikoo Qiongzhou and Jardine Matheson Yusheng ships, which were originally scheduled to depart for Haiphong this afternoon, depend on the condition of the hurricane on whether they could depart on time. As for other incoming and outgoing ships, they will also be affected by the hurricane, and the shipping schedule will inevitably be delayed.</p>
<h3>The Public Works Department Has Established a Committee to Handle the Reassessment of Rental Values for Owner-Occupied Housing; The Donation Amount for Next Year Will Be Based on the New Assessment</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department of the Public Concession established a small committee consisting of experts on the first of this month to reassess the rental value of industrial or commercial premises used by property owners for the purpose of collecting municipal general donations. It has now started work. Regarding appeals on housing rental assessments, the Public Works Department also stipulates the following procedures: The rental value to be used for collecting donations after reassessment shall be notified to the property owner in writing. Starting from January 1, 1941, donations shall be collected according to the new assessment. If the property owner is dissatisfied with the reassessed rental value, he shall obtain the prescribed appeal form from the office of the Director-General of the Bureau within 30 days after receiving the notice and submit it to the Bureau's Finance, Donation, and Appeals Committee to file an appeal. The said rental value shall take effect from January 1, 1941. The reasons for believing that the assessed rental value is inappropriate shall be stated in detail.</p>
<h3>Evacuation of Staff from the Nanshi Refugee Area Separately</h3>
<p>Since Father Jacquinot left Shanghai to return to his country, the Nanshi Refugee Area was forced to disband the refugees who had been maintained in the area for three years at the end of last month because of the lack of a head and the extreme shortage of funds in the area. However, the staff of the various departments and shelters belonging to the general office of the area usually totaled hundreds of people. Therefore, the association had a thorough discussion on how to evacuate these staff who had made considerable contributions. Until recently, it was decided to give each staff member the lowest allowance and evacuate them. It is learned that the French Concession Public Welfare Charity Association is now handling everything.</p>
<h3>The Fourth Phase of Price Stabilization Will Be Implemented on the 16th; 60 Rice Shops in the Two Concessions Undertake; Each Person is Limited to Purchasing 4 Jin of Rice for One Yuan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Price Stabilization Committee announced: "For the purpose of announcement, it is hereby decided to continue to hold the fourth phase of price stabilization starting at 7:00 am on July 16 (new clock). According to the previous method, the Rice Industry Association is still entrusted to designate 60 member rice shops in the two concessions to handle the price stabilization. Among them, there are 36 in the Public Concession, with 18 selling tickets and 18 distributing rice, and 24 in the French Concession, with 12 selling tickets and 12 distributing rice. They have now been designated by the Rice Industry Association respectively and will open on time. Those who buy rice must purchase rice according to the following methods and must not rush and squeeze. In addition to reporting to the authorities of the two concessions to order various police stations to assist in sending police to suppress and protect, this announcement is hereby made. The specific rules for price stabilization are as follows: (1) It is stipulated that each person is limited to buying rice up to one yuan in Shanghai general legal tender and must not buy more. (2) Each yuan sells 4 jin of rice. (3) Each shop is limited to selling 50 bags of rice per day. (4) The sales time is from 7:00 am (new clock) to 10:00 am every day. Sales will stop at any time after 50 bags are sold. (5) Those who buy rice must purchase rice tickets and then go to the rice distribution point designated on the rice ticket to collect rice and must not be confused." At this moment, the association has already sent letters to the authorities of the two concessions to send detectives to the various price stabilization points at that time to protect them.</p>
<p>Second Evaluation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Evaluation Committee held its second Evaluation Committee meeting at its meeting place at 15 Edinburgh Road at 3 pm yesterday. The highest prices for Yangmi sold in the market on the 13th, 15th, and 16th were evaluated on the spot. The prices are: No. 1 Saigon Siam 61.5 yuan, Huojiao 61 yuan, No. 2 Saigon Siam 59.5 yuan, Xiaojiao 59 yuan (the above are all reduced by 2 yuan compared to before), Gao Dongjing Usuyome 56.5 yuan, Dongjing Rough Rice 53 yuan (the above two are reduced by 3 yuan), Rice Tea 51 yuan (reduced by 2.5 yuan), Mixed Broken Rice 47 yuan (reduced by 2 yuan). It was also decided on the spot that the price of various foreign rice marked by rice shops should only increase by 1.5 yuan compared to the evaluated price. The rice industry's rice purchase team is actively encouraging purchases and has commissioned 3,000 tons, with prices for two types, namely 64.5 yuan and 66 yuan (No. 2 Saigon Rice).</p>
<p>Robbing Rice in Border Areas</p>
<p>After incidents of rice robbing occurred in Hongkou and West Shanghai, rice shops were afraid of suffering losses, so they announced that they would close shop starting yesterday, pulled up the iron gates, and transactions were generally carried out through small window holes. At the same time, the police authorities of the two concessions have increased the number of detectives patrolling various roads to protect them in order to prevent rice robbing incidents from occurring. The loading and unloading of rice grains at warehouses and wharves is especially tightly guarded. The group purchase of foreign rice initiated by the Civil Food Adjustment Association is still continuing to be registered. The Price Stabilization Committee also appealed to all sectors to actively donate funds in order to carry out price stabilization for a long time and maintain the livelihoods of ordinary people.</p>
<h3>Refugee Population Statistics</h3>
<p>According to a report from the Public Works Department Health Department on the 11th of this month, there are currently 13 shelters that have been inspected, accommodating a total of 17,771 refugees.</p>
<h3>Xu Maotang et al. Still Reside in the Hospital; Not Sent to Hongkou</h3>
<p>The English "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" stated that the rumor spread by a certain newspaper this (12th) morning that Xu Maotang, manager of the Chung Wai Bank, and accountant Xu Yongzuo had been sent to a certain hospital in Hongkou at the instigation of the Japanese authorities has been denied by the French Concession Police Department. It is said that the two men are ill due to the summer heat and are now being treated at Kwong Tze Hospital in the French Concession. It is learned that regarding the arrest of the two men, the Japanese military and the French police authorities are jointly conducting an investigation, while the two men are still being guarded by the French police, pending the results of further investigation. According to the two authorities, after the agreement was reached between the French and Japanese authorities, the Japanese military police and the French police arrested the Chinese for the first time.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Funds Return to Shanghai Again; Approximately 150 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>After the war, Shanghai was flooded with floating capital, leading to rampant speculation. Due to the serious situation in Europe, funds flowed back to Shanghai from Hong Kong. According to statistics, the amount is 150 million yuan. As a result, Shanghai's floating capital is becoming more abundant. The banking and money industries, recognizing that the abundance of floating capital leads to financial crises, are focusing on the finance of the hinterland in order to stabilize finance and prevent speculation, and are trying to divert floating capital to develop in the interior.</p>
<h3>Suicide Case at the New Asia Hotel; Truth of the Triangular Love; Jewish Mr. and Mrs. Meiyou Reconciled after Splashing Water; Russian Man Has an Affair with His Wife, and Everyone Does Not Object; Embezzlement of Public Funds Discovered, Three People Committed Suicide</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that one night this week, Jewish refugee Meiyou (48 years old), a tenant of the New Asia Hotel, his wife, and a White Russian named Kazi, committed suicide by poisoning at the same time. On Tuesday morning, it was discovered and sent to Gongji Hospital. Meiyou died at 9:05 am on Thursday morning. His wife and Kazi are still unconscious and their fate is uncertain. According to detectives from the police station, the Meiyou couple took refuge in Shanghai about a year ago and soon divorced. Kazi is an employee of the Czech company Xiba Bakery Factory at 394 Zhoushan Road. About two months ago, he met Mrs. Meiyou by chance and fell in love at first sight. He often visited, posing as the owner of the factory, behaving lavishly, in order to win Mrs. Meiyou's favor. However, Mrs. Meiyou and Kazi were not in contact for long before she reunited with her husband. Meiyou also did not object to his wife's contact with Kazi, and they lived in peace. However, good times do not last long. Kazi spent extravagantly, and his monthly salary was not enough to cover his expenses. He secretly altered the accounts in an attempt to cover up his actions, but was eventually discovered by Mr. Shijielakati, the owner of the factory, who reported it to the French Concession Police Station. It turned out that Kazi lived on Lafayette Road. Kazi, having heard the news, did not dare to go to work at the factory. On Sunday, he invited the Meiyou couple to a secret room in the New Asia Hotel and confessed to embezzling public funds. However, it is still a mystery why the three of them suddenly committed suicide together. The truth will not be known until Mrs. Meiyou and Kazi wake up. Also, the English "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" stated that Mr. Shijielakati, the owner of the Xiba Bakery Factory, filed a lawsuit in the Special First Court this (12th) morning against Kazi (51 years old), the Russian manager of the factory, for embezzling 1,500 yuan of public funds. The case is scheduled to continue on the 19th of this month. It is learned that the amount of money embezzled by Kazi is more than this. After a detailed investigation, the amount may reach 50,000 yuan in total. Kazi is now in the hospital and his condition has improved. However, Mrs. Meiyou's condition has worsened. It is learned that Kazi embezzled public funds and, knowing that he had been exposed, invited the Meiyou couple to the New Asia Hotel, told them the truth, saying that there was no solution other than the three of them committing suicide together. The Meiyou couple, because their expenses depended on Kazi, agreed to take poison and die together upon hearing this.</p>
<h3>代客贖當判處拘役　工部局嚴予取締</h3>
<p>Recently, a new type of business has emerged in Shanghai, namely the so-called "redeeming pawns for customers." It has become very popular, and such shops can be seen at the entrances of various roads and alleyways. The business scope of these shops is specifically to collect pawn tickets. Because pawnshops greatly reduce the value of the pledged items when accepting them, these shops, when buying pawn tickets, in addition to deducting the pledged amount, also give customers a small amount of money to obtain the ownership of the pawn ticket, prepare funds to redeem the items from the pawnshop, and then sell them again. Through this transaction,</p>
<p>the shops that redeem pawns for customers earn huge profits, which is actually a business of exploiting the poor. Moreover, the authorities of the Municipal Council believe that the existence of this business not only exploits the poor, but also causes major difficulties for the police in handling cases due to the circulation of pawn tickets. This is because common thieves and bandits, after stealing and robbing items, sell the pawn tickets to these people. However, the police often obtain clues from the pawn tickets when cracking theft cases. Now that the rightful owner has lost the ticket, it is also difficult to solve the case. Therefore, an order was issued to ban these shops, requiring all pawn redemption shops within the concession to close completely by the end of May of this year; otherwise,</p>
<p>legal action will be taken. After this order was issued, many people complied with it, but there were still quite a few who continued to operate. The day before yesterday afternoon, Chinese and foreign detectives from the Hongkou police station discovered several people operating this type of pawn redemption business in Dexing Lane, Peng Road. Eight people were arrested, including Ying A'gen, Yu A'miao, Zhang Yaoming, Gu Yanying, Li Peixuan, Peng Liankun, Ni Changle, and Zhang Shuwan. Three suitcases of pawn tickets and account books were seized and taken back to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the Special First Court for violation of police regulations. The police station filed a lawsuit in accordance with Article 33, Section 1 of the Regulations on Punishment of Police Violations, requesting that they be punished according to law. After questioning by Judge Shen Shanzeng, the eight people, including Ying, were sentenced to seven days of detention each as a warning.</p>

<h3>Over Ten Thousand More Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive, Rice Prices Plummet Again by Two or Three Yuan</h3>
<p>The downstream rice market has been sluggish for days. Yesterday, a large batch of foreign rice continued to arrive, causing even more public anxiety. The prices of various types of foreign rice plummeted again by two or three yuan. Merchants saw the market glutted with goods and shrinking by the day. Aside from some shops in this street replenishing their stock, other outlets have completely stopped. The more they try to sell, the more intense the slump becomes. Although the volume of transactions seemed to increase slightly as a result, the prices of various types of foreign rice have fallen by another two or three yuan compared to the previous market. At the close, No. 1 Saigon was only 60 yuan and 5 jiao, 60 yuan; No. 2 was 57 yuan and 5 jiao, 57 yuan; No. 1 Siam was 60 yuan; No. 2 was 57 yuan and 5 jiao, 57 yuan; Fire-milled was 59 yuan, 58 yuan and 5 jiao; Hong Kong Pointed was 56 yuan and 5 jiao, 56 yuan and 2 jiao; Tokyo Pointed was 54 yuan and 5 jiao, 53 yuan; Broken Pointed Special was 45 yuan, ultimately 40 yuan; Rice Tea was 47-48 yuan. Only Small Milled was the most popular, and although it depreciated less, it was still fresher than other goods, remaining at 58 yuan and 5 jiao. However, the market sentiment for foreign rice is gradually clearing up as more of it comes in, and the market is turning around. Additionally, transshipment assistance has slightly increased, resulting in prices rising by half a yuan compared to the previous day. The total market transaction volume was over 400 tons. The Yinghua Company immediately traded No. 2 Siam rice at a price of 70 yuan. The price for rice loaded on June 20 was 68 yuan and 5 jiao to 8 jiao, and for rice loaded on June 26, it was 68 yuan to 68 yuan and 6 jiao and a half.</p>
<p>The arrival of japonica and glutinous domestic rice remains scarce. The sales market is currently in a depressed state, and both the open and black markets are declining. As a result, prices are falling along with foreign rice, continuing to drop by one or two yuan. Rumor has it that the Changbang Special Clean Japonica is only 70 yuan, Su Kun Changzhou White Japonica is 67-68 yuan, Decided-Under Accommodation is 64-65 yuan, Qing Si Thin Rice is 68-69 yuan, Nangang Early Rice is 65-66 yuan, and Hu Jian is around 63 yuan. Glutinous rice Jinli goods are 64-65 yuan, Changdan goods are 62-63 yuan, Hong Kong White Yuan is 65 yuan, etc.</p>
<p>The arrival of foreign rice in Shanghai is booming. The day before yesterday, a total of six ships arrived in Shanghai. Except for the Taikoo Company's Chengdu ship, whose exact number was unknown due to its late arrival, the five ships together brought over 77,000 bags, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the Chengdu ship carried 14,702 bags, which were unloaded at the company's dock in Pudong.</p>
<h3>鳳凰牌粉貶價</h3>
<h3>Phoenix Brand Flour Devalued</h3>
<p>Flour is quite soft, as Japanese flour and miscellaneous domestic brands of flour are taking the opportunity to dump their product as the supply from Chinese flour factories is reduced. There are continuous sales of foreign flour, and people are generally discouraged. Yesterday, due to the sharp drop in rice prices, buyers were solely focused on driving down prices. It is reported that the prices of Japanese flour Phoenix brand are falling even more sharply, with the July price only 15 yuan and 4 jiao, August 15 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, September 16 yuan. Other domestic flours are also falling by 1 or 2 jiao. The offer price from Chinese flour factories remains 15 yuan and 2 jiao, with 3,000 to 4,000 bags supplied by the Fufeng factory.</p>
<p>The new wheat market is also easing. Inquiries are all being handled in Hongkou. The majority is purchased by Japanese factories, with prices around 23 yuan per 100 catties. The Chinese factories have not been able to purchase a large amount, so the market is not officially opening. It is heard that Fuxin and Fufeng have purchased Australian foreign wheat, and the first batch is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the end of this month.</p>

<h3>新空復起金市回挫</h3>
<h3>Gold Market Declines as New Short Selling Emerges</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold bar black market conditions, after two days of gains, suddenly declined, contrary to the expectations of those who had profited in the past. Because the market's ups and downs are unstable, the general public has become cautious. Therefore, after opening at 5,530 yuan, the price rose to a high of 5,560 yuan under the purchase of both the gold and silver firms. However, after that, various firms aggressively released gold, short positions were closed, and new sellers emerged. It was also heard that the exchange market had loosened, resulting in a huge selling frenzy, causing the price to plummet by about 200 yuan, with a low of 5,365 yuan. The noon close was stable at 5,400 yuan. The market trend in the afternoon was flat. It initially opened at 5,390 yuan, then fell another 10 yuan. Later, due to the income of the currency exchange industry, it recovered to 5,425 yuan. As a result, it ultimately closed at 5,415 yuan, down 75 yuan compared to the previous day. About 3,000 taels were traded throughout the day. The results for gold jewelry stores were unchanged, and the gold price set by customs, etc., remained stable.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Bars Down 75 Yuan</p>
<p>From the beginning of the morning, the price per bar (ten taels) was initially affected by the declining exchange rate and the tightening of the US exchange rate. The market's sentiment from the previous day was good, which led to strong buying interest when it opened, and the price immediately jumped by 40 yuan. The silver firm purchased 30 taels for 5,530 yuan. Subsequently, the currency exchange industry and the gold and silver firms bought in, and the price continued to rise by 30 yuan. The silver firm sold 20 taels to the currency exchange industry, rising to 5,560 yuan. However, at this time, the foreign exchange market suddenly loosened, and the silver and gold firms turned from buying to selling. Moreover, many long positions in the currency exchange industry were closed. Some traders heard that HSBC was releasing a large amount of both British and American currency, so they went short in the gold market. As a result, the selling pressure gradually increased, and the price continued to fall. After 11 o'clock, it even broke through the 5,400 yuan level. The silver firms traded 20 taels among themselves, and the price dropped to 5,365 yuan. After that, the selling pressure eased slightly, and some gold and silver firms bought back their short positions at low prices. The silver firm purchased 20 taels from the gold firm by noon, for 5,400 yuan, which was the noon closing price. The market situation was quiet in the afternoon. It opened slightly lower, and the silver firm conducted some trading for 10 taels, for 5,390 yuan. Then, because the gold firm was releasing gold, the price fell again by 10 yuan. The gold firm sold 10 taels to the silver firm, dropping to 5,380 yuan. Subsequently, a certain silver firm and the currency exchange industry gradually absorbed it, and the market situation turned around. The gold firm sold a total of 30 taels to silver store companies and currency exchange companies, reaching as high as 5,425 yuan. Afterwards, the gold firm continued to release gold, reducing the price again by 10 yuan. The silver firm traded 10 taels for 5,415 yuan, which was the evening closing price. As a result, it fell by 75 yuan compared to the previous day, with a total fluctuation of 195 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the gold shops' own-brand gold was about 10 yuan higher than the spot price, and the purchase price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the posted gold price, and there were few open trades.</p>
<p>The Results for Gold Jewelry were Unchanged</p>
<p>The initial price for jewelry gold at silver stores was still 560 yuan per tael at Datongxing. It increased by 10 yuan at 9:30, fell back by 10 yuan at 10:15, and then fell again by 10 yuan at 11:15. It increased by 10 yuan at 3:00 PM, with a result of flat overall.

<h3>雜項香烟暗盤上漲</h3>
<h3>Miscellaneous: Cigarette Black Market Rises</h3>
<p>The cigarette black market has been rising recently. Because there is a scarcity of goods in the market, there are widespread rumors that the Yizhong Cigarette Factory is being reorganized. Buying interest was strong. The British-American Tobacco brand rose 70 yuan compared to last week. The Wuhua brand exceeded the market price by more than 30 yuan. The opening prices yesterday were 968 yuan for the British-American Tobacco brand, 647 yuan for the Pinhai brand, 760 yuan for the Lao Dao brand, and 503 yuan for the Wuhua brand.

<h3>Securities: Foreign Shares Continue to Perform Strongly — Two Rubber Stocks Issue Dividends</h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities black market was even more chaotic, and trading decreased even more. People are not interested in these dogs, and the number of people gathering in the market is becoming increasingly scarce, which makes people feel uneasy. Therefore, it is not easy to break the stagnant situation for the time being. Yesterday's transactions were mostly just small retail investors closing deals on the floor. There were very few new investors or large investors joining in. The market is gradually losing its speculative nature. As a result, it recovered slightly by about 0.1 yuan, with a total transaction volume of about 300,000 yuan. A brief summary is provided below:</p>
<p>For stock trading, 50 shares of the Commercial Press were traded at a price of 70 yuan each.</p>
<p>Although yesterday was Friday for the Public Industry Association, there were no weekend closings. The market continued to perform strongly, with the increases being more forceful. Near the close, the buying activity was particularly good, which shows that the market currently has abundant funds and that speculators and investors have confidence in the future outlook. The future dividends of rubber stocks will definitely meet the expectations of most people. It cannot be said that the rising prices are without reason. Industrial stocks have also risen sharply, but their activity is slightly worse than that of rubber stocks. With no special changes in the weekend news, the market is expected to continue to rise next week.</p>
<p>Chaw Kangsha, manager of the British-owned Huatong Foreign Company, and two oak tree companies, Yingda District Co., Ltd., announced the distribution of interim dividends for 1940. Chaw Kangsha will pay 0.25 yuan in national currency per share, starting from July 30, and Yingda District will pay 1.5 yuan in national currency per share, starting from August 6.</p>
<p>London, 11th (Thursday) Telegraph: The listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and stocks of various Far East British companies were generally stable today, with no changes in the market. (According to the previous two days, only HSBC's shares showed slight fatigue, with Hong Kong registered shares falling by one pound on the 9th, to 65 pounds, and British registered shares falling by one pound on the 10th, to 64 pounds.)</p>
<h3>紗花　棉紗大戶　逢高仍有賣出</h3>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Major Cotton Yarn Dealers Still Selling at High Prices</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially rose and then declined, with the overall result being flat. In fact, after rising for several days, the amount of spot yarn currently available from the Hong Kong dealers has been substantial. There has been a temporary sense of saturation, so purchasing has greatly decreased today. However, most insiders are still optimistic. A certain major dealer has shown a tendency to sell at high prices. In short, yarn prices are fluctuating within 100 yuan.</p>
<p>The opening price for spot yarn continued the momentum from the previous day, with many taking the opportunity to raise prices aggressively, creating a surging situation. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse was 1,045 yuan, up more than 30 yuan. Shortly after, it rose to 1,064 yuan. As soon as this high price opened, a selling frenzy arose as many long positions took the opportunity to close. As a result, the market loosened and the price gradually fell to 1,013 yuan. After fluctuating at this low point for a long time, it recovered and rose to 1,020 yuan. The closing price was 1,017 yuan. According to statistics, 1,427 packages were traded during the half-day. The price for 20-count Double Horse rose by 3 yuan. 100 pieces of export yarn were shipped to Haikou today, and 650 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amounts purchased by various parties are listed below:</p>
<p>Dealers, 130; Ningbo, 77; Hong Kong, 160; Mainland, 60; Total, 1,427.</p>
<h3>Factory's Appetite is Weak, Cotton Market Quiet</h3>
<p>The unusually bustling cotton situation of the day before yesterday suddenly dissolved yesterday. This is because various parties have sufficient stock on hand, and when the market improves, everyone is eager to unload. As for the factories, they lack a strong appetite, thus business has returned to a quiet state.</p>
<p>American Cotton Packed at $203.00, 63 Bales Purchased by Fellow Traders</p>
<p>Supplementary Market Prices Not Recorded Last Time:</p>
<p>General Packed at $195.00, 500 Bales Domestic and Foreign Purchase</p>
<p>North Market: $151.00, 500 Bales Purchased by Feng Kee</p>
<p>Dazhong Collective: $201.00, 100 Bales Purchased by Fellow Traders</p>
<p>Hui Shi Deng: $2108.00, 200 Bales Purchased by Tong Xing</p>
<p>Additional News: The opening of the foreign cotton market yesterday morning was quite active. After selling, due to purchases in the market on Wall Street, some short positions were covered. As a result, closing prices were down 2-3 points for near-term deliveries compared to the previous day, and up 5-6 points for long-term deliveries. The Indian cotton market was quite firm, rising another 2 robies yesterday, including forecasts.</p>
<p>The foreign cotton trade in Shanghai has entered a lively phase, with transactions being quite good, involving over a thousand bales. However, most purchases were made by Japanese factories. With stable yarn prices, Chinese factories are also showing buying interest, but due to tight credit, they cannot match the Japanese factories' forward transactions. Therefore, fewer transactions are concluded. Current cotton stocks have decreased significantly, and most floating orders have been cut and sold. Moreover, the transportation of Indian cotton is difficult. Therefore, the future cotton market is on the right track, and the sentiment among traders is quite strong.</p>
<h3>Coal and Indian Coal Flood In</h3>
<p>Since summer, the sales of Durgapur coal have been slow. Orders have already been reduced, but the supply continues to be frequent, and prices are increasingly unsustainable. Recently, a certain firm received an order for over 10,000 tons of lump coal and fines. The coal has been unloaded from the trains at the docks. The prices for opening the door for merchants are 250 yuan per ton for lump coal and 230 yuan for coal fines. Fellow traders picking up their own coal from the trains will receive a deduction of 20 yuan per ton.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes - Bean Cakes Plummet</h3>
<p>After the rainfall, the bean cake market saw a brief surge in confidence, and prices rose sharply. However, this did not last long, as the weather showed no further signs of rain. Speculators in bean cakes were hit hard, and the market situation deteriorated daily, with prices plummeting. Yesterday, the market fell sharply by another 6 jiao, more than 2 yuan below the peak price (on the 4th). Only 4,000 pieces of Sheng Ji cakes were settled by inland traders, priced from 11 yuan 3 jiao to 11 yuan. 700 pieces of Da You Si Pai cakes were priced at 12 yuan 8 jiao to 6 jiao. One cart of Yuan Long cakes was priced at 11 yuan. One cart of Fei Zi cakes was priced at 11 yuan 1 jiao. 1,100 pieces of Qing Zhong cakes were priced from 11 yuan to 10 yuan 4 jiao. On the 13th, 635 bales of soybeans and 600 bales of sesame seeds were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods - Cotton Cloth Speculation Resurges</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: The cloth market continued to rise this morning due to renewed speculation. Traders are increasing their inventory, and buying interest is strong. However, the number of pieces offered by the factories is limited, making the market quite tight. There is a trend of increasing prices with each sale. Sales of white cloth from Yihe rough cloth suddenly increased by 5 jiao to 1 yuan per bolt. Printed cloth from the Lun Chang factory and other goods increased by 1 yuan to 1.5 yuan per bolt. Fine cloth, twill, and rough cloth from various Chinese factories also increased by about 5 jiao per bolt. Over 500 pieces of white cloth, over 200 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth, nearly 300 pieces were handled by the Ningbo gang, and over 2,000 bolts of fine twill were handled by the Hong Kong gang were transacted on this street.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Due to the continued rise in yarn prices, speculative buying by outside investors suddenly increased in the morning market, and prices rose sharply. Twelve-pound Longtou fine cloth was sold at 31 yuan 7-8 jiao, and Sijunzi Serge reached 9 jiao 3.5 fen per yard. However, soon after, fellow traders started selling, and fine cloth dropped to 30 yuan 4 jiao. The minimum price in the afternoon fell to 29 yuan 5 jiao. Finally, due to the excessive decline, fellow traders covered their positions and the price rebounded to 30 yuan 5 jiao at closing. Serge was at 8 jiao 9 fen. In terms of actual sales, over 200 pieces of fine cloth and over 50 cases of Serge were handled by the Tianjin gang, while scattered buyers and traders made speculative transactions. The total turnover of various goods was around 1,000 pieces. Therefore, although market prices were lower than the previous day, the situation is gradually stabilizing.</p>
<p>Exports: Today, 70 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong, and another 90 pieces were shipped to Haikou.</p>

<h3>Old News, Newly Copied - Sixty-Seven Years Ago - (443) - (From the Shen Bao of the Twelfth Year of Tongzhi, Qing Dynasty)</h3>
<p>Acrobatic Performance with Ropes (2)</p>
<p>A person stands on the back of a horse, and the horse moves like an arrow, while the person stands as steady as a mountain. When returning, the person rotates in all directions, standing on the horse's back. Then, they perform "Lingbo Double Scissors," doing a handstand on the saddle. Suddenly, they move left and right, doing a somersault and sitting upright on the horse. At this time, the cheers are like a mountain collapsing and a river boiling. The horse has already disappeared in the distance. The third time, the person clings to the horse's belly, rising and falling suddenly, like turning in circles. From dawn until the sun rises, the horse riding performance ends. After removing makeup and resting briefly, the spectators disperse. Soon after, they begin the knife ladder act. A soft ladder is placed next to the knife ladder, with ropes tied to the knives to facilitate climbing. Each step is about two feet apart, with more than twenty knives in total, making about twenty steps on the ladder. At midday, when the gong suddenly sounds, the spectators gather again. Two women walk up together, said to be climbing the knife ladder. Reaching the middle, they perform the "inverted pearl curtain" move, doing somersaults, continuously ascending the blades. Nearing the top, a knife is placed horizontally, with the back facing up and the blade facing down, upon which one woman briefly sits. Soon after, a woman and a child continue to climb, as swift as a monkey climbing a tree. When the ladder can no longer accommodate them, they climb to the very top, sitting on a chair-table. The two women use the chair circle and their hands to perform various acrobatic tricks, such as handstands and butterfly flips. Suddenly, one woman hangs upside down, pretending to lose her footing, falling from the sky. At this moment, the spectators' hearts are filled with fear. Not daring to blink, the woman wraps her feet around a rope and stands upright. In a few days, people come from far and wide to watch, with crowds incessantly streaming along the road.</p>

<h3>Jesus is the Savior of Women</h3>
<p>The Jews and all ancient peoples had customs of valuing men over women. The Book of Genesis records that "woman came from man." The Jews misunderstood this, leading to various tragedies of disrespect for women in their thousands of years of history. In our own history, lacking understanding of the true principles, we treated women cruelly. "A woman's lack of talent is a virtue," and "men manage external affairs, women manage internal affairs," leading to women having no status in society. Moreover, there were "three obediences and four virtues," as well as "seven grounds for divorce" and other enslaving education and systems that restricted them, turning them into appendages and playthings of men. In reality, women also experience ten months of pregnancy. Apart from slight differences in physiological structure compared to men, there is no inherent hierarchy of male superiority and female inferiority. After Jesus came into the world, he did not disrespect women because the Jews disrespected them. Instead, he respected them, raising their status and making them equal to men.</p>
<p>Jesus advocated that men and women who committed adultery should be punished equally. He also advocated that men could divorce adulterous women, but did not specify that women could not divorce adulterous men. He also advocated that one husband and one wife is a sacred truth and that scripture should not be misinterpreted or laws created by man used to easily separate them. He further warned men, saying, "Anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart."</p>
<p>During his time in the world, Jesus did not discriminate between men and women in spreading the gospel, healing diseases, exorcising demons, preaching, or forgiving sins. Examining the Bible, it is clear and undeniable. Furthermore, after he rose from the dead on the third day, he first appeared to a woman named Mary. The first believer in Europe was a woman named Lydia, who sold purple cloth. The first girls' school in China was founded by the Jesus Church. Other institutions established by Christians to benefit women and improve the status of women are too numerous to count.</p>
<p>In short, wherever Jesus’s teachings reach, the women there gain liberation and salvation. Reading the history of ancient and modern times, and looking at the phenomena in our society, it is women who suffer the most, are the most oppressed, and are the most abused. Alas! The modern world is mass-producing lonely widows, adding pain upon pain to women. The modern world applies all kinds of pressure, forcing women onto the path of sin and destruction. Who is the savior of women? Thanks be to God! Because Jesus was sent into the world to save us. I sincerely hope that my female compatriots in China will quickly turn around and accept your teacher, Jesus Christ.</p>

<h3>Dead People</h3>
<p>— Tao</p>
<p>What is a dead person? Is it simply someone who has stopped breathing? That's probably the common answer. But if you ask a deeper, more forceful question: what kind of person is a dead person? Edison already answered, "Every person who has no value is a dead person." In Pythagoras's school in ancient times, if someone got tired of studying and wanted to quit, everyone would hold a funeral for them as they left, erecting a tombstone to warn other students, because they believed that the quitter was a dead person and hoped that others would not follow in their footsteps. Similarly, in countries where Catholicism was prevalent at that time, every woman who entered a convent always brought a coffin with her and held a solemn funeral, indicating that she could no longer achieve anything—that is, she was dead!</p>
<p>Based on this view, if we look at the world, we can see that many powerful, well-fed, and well-dressed people are already dead. They merely maintain a illusory life and display decoration, but in reality, aren't they no different from walking corpses? Only those people in the world whose purpose is to improve themselves and increase the welfare of others can be considered alive. In the short span of sixty or seventy years of life, as it seems now, a person only lives for a few years, and most of the world is filled with dead people. Some people only start living at twenty, some at thirty, some at sixty, while others die before they even live!</p>
<p>When the ancient Persian king Xerxes stood on a small mountain and looked out, he couldn't help but weep, thinking that none of these many soldiers would still be alive in a hundred years! Therefore, Edison said: "When I look at this populous city, I can't help but weep! Because few of these many people are alive now, and observing the cause of their death, most of them are attacked by a disease with a very destructive power, which is commonly called 'laziness.'" So we should try our best to eradicate this epidemic and try our best to promote the early birth of youth and the resurrection of the elderly!……!"</p>
<p>Do you want to be a dead person? Do you want to be seen as a dead person? If not, then quickly examine whether your life is meaningful, whether you have been invaded by "laziness," and move towards the path of life!</p>

<h3>Lenin's Remains</h3>
<p>— Zhendong</p>
<p>In recent international affairs, besides the United States, Soviet Russia can be said to be the most eye-catching country in the world. And the success of Soviet Russia today makes one think of Lenin, the founding father of Soviet Russia. He is one of the world's great men, and the only person in the world whose remains have been preserved to this day. Lenin died on January 21, 1924, which is sixteen years ago this year. His remains are in Red Square in Moscow. Lenin's tomb is entirely made of granite, and the tomb passage is quite tortuous. However, the architectural style is simple and solemn. Visitors walk down the stone steps to a large room, in the center of which is the place where Lenin's remains are located. A red rug is spread on top, and the body is placed in a glass coffin, through which one can see his remains. The body is covered with a velvet blanket, with the head, shoulders, and hands exposed. He looks as if he is sleeping peacefully, and his face is slightly gray. The fact that his remains can be preserved for so long for millions to admire is due to the efforts of two outstanding Soviet Russian scientists.</p>
<p>When Lenin died at his residence in Gorki, outside Moscow, the government ordered that embalming techniques be applied to the remains, injecting preservative solutions into the blood vessels. However, this method was not very effective. At that time, tens of thousands of people flocked to see the remains. Lenin died on January 21st, and by mid-February, more than 100,000 people had visited Red Square to pay their respects. But by the end of February, the skin of the remains had shown signs of drying out and discoloration, indicating that it was necessary to study alternative preservation methods. Therefore, the authorities convened many famous scientists from the country to discuss how to prevent the appearance of the remains from changing. However, after several meetings, they unanimously said that this was impossible, because it was impossible to prevent the external tissues of a corpse from changing in air and at normal temperatures. The mummies of ancient Egypt were only to prevent the corpse from decomposing further, but to keep the appearance unchanged had not been invented in recent science. However, Stalin hired Professor Uroplov, a famous anatomist, and Professor Sparoski, a biochemist, to conduct painstaking research and create a unique method that could preserve the appearance for a long time and permanently. On March 26, 1924, they performed another operation to prevent the face from shrinking and to stop the cell tissues from self-destructing. Thus, Lenin's remains became mummified. This method was successfully applied using the latest knowledge and skills in anatomy and biochemistry. After four months of efforts by the two professors, the work was completed on July 26, achieving the expected goal. Lenin's tomb was reopened to the public, and over 16 million people have visited it in the sixteen years and several months since then. Whenever foreigners come to Moscow, visiting the remains becomes a necessary part of the itinerary. The remains are still in perfect condition and will not change in the future. The two professors have also been responsible for the preservation and care of the remains. However, Professor Uroplov passed away in 1937, and now Professor Shi and several of his assistants continue to work.</p>

<h3>Creating Destiny</h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>Living in this competitive society, everyone should cultivate a strong sense of self-confidence. No matter how difficult the environment or how many times we fail, we should always use the greatest perseverance to overcome them. After crossing through layers of darkness, we will surely step onto the path of light. Many people become discouraged when they encounter difficulties, or lose heart in adversity. They cannot muster the courage to make further efforts. Decadence, discouragement, disappointment, and depression bury their future, making them feel that life has no value worth cherishing.</p>
<p>In the long journey of life, it will never be smooth sailing forever, without unexpected setbacks. If we encounter an unfavorable situation and do not want to overcome it, merely evading the responsibility of striving forward, then difficulties will never leave. This fully expresses the fatalistic thinking of world-weariness, believing that the success or failure of people's careers depends on predetermined fate, which cannot be reversed by human effort.</p>
<p>In fact, fate is not really a hindrance to our success. Throughout history, countless entrepreneurs and academics have relied on strong self-confidence and perseverance, endured countless hardships, and were ultimately able to make great contributions to humanity. Undoubtedly, they broke free from the shackles of fate and became people who controlled their destiny. Why do we say that they are people who control their destiny? Because they believe in themselves and believe that they can overcome adverse circumstances and move towards their set goals. Difficulties are only powerful factors that hone them, and failures increase their courage to continue fighting. They have a firm belief in life, and no setbacks or obstacles can shake their will. The success of these people is due to their ability to "create destiny," believing that destiny is in their hands and cannot be manipulated by others.</p>
<p>Conversely, those weaklings who cannot withstand the storms of life, when encountering adversity, only passively endure and conform, as if destined to be manipulated by fate. They never plan to overcome difficulties, and even go from "accepting fate" to "resenting fate," pitying themselves and thinking that encountering misfortune is inevitable, and simply cannot find a better path than to resent and complain about fate.</p>
<p>Ibsen said, "You must cast this material into pottery," which is very capable of alerting us to strengthen the confidence of life, temper ourselves through hardship, educate ourselves, and always be a person who "creates destiny"!</p>
<p>Hawthorne Case</p>
<h3>The Sudden Return of the Dancing Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Conflicting Information</p>
<p>When I heard this, I had to admit that the situation had progressed further. Just now, Jinmei repeatedly said that Yu Gantang hadn't been back since the argument on the eleventh, which made me feel like she was deliberately covering for him. Now it was confirmed. But why was she doing this?</p>
<p>Hawthorne nodded and said, "From Jinmei's tone, I had already guessed that Yu Gantang had been here last night. Lao Mao, when did he come last night? How did you see him? Weren't you out watching a show last night?"</p>
<p>Lao Mao said, "I saw him just as I was leaving to watch the show. It was about seven o'clock. I had just walked out the door when I suddenly saw him standing at the entrance."</p>
<p>"Did he greet you?"</p>
<p>"He asked me, 'Is Miss Wang home?' I replied that she wasn't. He also asked, 'Has Zhao Boxiong been here today?' I replied that he hadn't. Then I asked him if there was anything I could do. But he ignored me and turned around and left."</p>
<p>Hawthorne pondered for a moment and then said, "You say he's the murderer, but is it just because of these two things?" Lao Mao shook his head and said, "No, there's also—there's something even more suspicious."</p>
<p>"Something even more suspicious? What?"</p>
<p>"Yesterday morning, when I was washing the stairs, he called on the phone—sir, the telephone booth is right on the turn of the stairs."</p>
<p>"Did you answer it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, he didn't say his name, but I could tell it was his voice. He wanted Miss Wang to talk to him, so I went upstairs to tell her."</p>
<p>"Did Miss Wang talk to him?"</p>
<p>Lao Mao nodded. "She did, but after only a few words, they started arguing on the phone." (43)</p>

<h3>There Are Reasons For Everything</h3>
<p>— Xiaotian</p>
<p>Mozi wore himself out from head to toe benefiting all under heaven. Yang Zhu would not sacrifice a single hair to benefit all under heaven, for his own sake. Thinking about it carefully, each had their own reasons. Mozi was willing to sacrifice himself to fulfill his obligations to the people of the world. If everyone could sacrifice themselves to fulfill their obligations to others, then where would there be any struggle for rights in the world? Yang Zhu was unwilling to pluck a hair to benefit others, but conversely, he would never want others to pluck a hair to benefit him. If everyone embraced the principle of neither wanting to suffer losses nor take advantage of others, then the world would be at peace. England wants to wipe out aggressors, saying it is fighting to maintain peace. Germany attacked countless countries, saying it was to strive for lasting peace. France initially resisted Germany, then surrendered to the enemy, and finally turned against England, yet it also had its own plausible reasons. Truly, there are reasons for everything.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Peking opera performers who are very influential in the performing arts world, it is the same. Tan Fuying adheres to the traditional style, Ma Lianliang emphasizes recitative over singing, innovating and introducing the new, Yan Jupeng uses his old foundation to cope with his voice. When encountering a highlight, he slows down the tempo and amplifies his voice, and the audience's applause inevitably follows. This is due to the limitation of talent. If he does not exert great effort and cannot cater to the audience's psychology, we should forgive him. As for the four tones and yin-yang nuances, after Mei Lanfang, he is still the most particular about them. Mei Lanfang's voice is broad and bright, coupled with a resonant erhu, which sounds good. Cheng Yanqiu's voice is slightly dry and astringent, and without the use of delicate tones, it lacks the lingering and poignant emotions. Some who learn from Mei Lanfang desperately slow down the tempo, those who learn from Cheng desperately force their voices to be thin, and those who learn from Ma ideally include dozens of entering-tone "bu" characters in their lyrics (note that there are no entering tones in Northern tunes; in the Beijing dialect, only the donkey cart drivers used a "da" sound, and then there's Lianliang's "bu" character). They say that without doing so, they cannot closely resemble them. Truly, there are reasons for everything.</p>
<p>Dancers say that the dance patrons are either sickly and dying or rich but unsophisticated. When dealing with the sickly, the higher the airs, the better. If you show a little conscience and compromise slightly, they will regard you as a bargain-basement item with no one interested in you, discarding you like worn-out shoes. The dying ones fundamentally cannot tell good from bad, simply echoing what others say. The rich ones won't make a sound unless you knock them. The unsophisticated ones are willing to make any sacrifice before signing. Afterwards, they are ruthless and recognize no relatives. Therefore, to expect them to treat people with sincerity is probably more than trying to find gold in sand, almost like fishing for the moon in the sea. Dance patrons say that the dancers are all fickle and inconstant, only knowing how to cherish silver dollars, which is considered top-notch. Being able to recognize customers who spend large amounts of money is even more top-notch. This sounds a bit too extreme, but in fact, most dancers forget that their youth lasts only a short seven or eight years. Therefore, the money they earn comes in easily and goes out just as quickly, spent on meaningless things. Therefore, even holding a stone, there is a day when it can be polished smooth, but trying to polish out the true feelings of a dancer is probably even harder than a stone. Truly, there are reasons for everything.</p>
<p>Finally, let's talk about our amateur opera circles. Some emphasize careful wording and detailed study, saying that the reason why amateurs are superior to professionals is precisely this. Some do not ask about principles but diligently practice, saying that the most important thing is to perform well on stage. Some say that we don't make money at all, so there's no need to delve into theory or practice skills. Just grasp a few lines of lyrics, play a role, and enjoy ourselves on stage. Isn't that great? Some say that performing on stage is not enjoyable at all. If you don't like studying, why spend money to suffer? Truly, there are reasons for everything.</p>
<p>In short, there is only one correct principle, but eighteen incorrect ones. As for which one is the correct principle, it is up to you to judge.</p>
<h3>Brief Review of Tan Fuying and Other Performers (Part 2)</h3>
<p>In the section before climbing the city gate, the tempo is "tightened up then relaxed." The "dao" character in "zhi jiao lao jun sao jie dao" suddenly shines with brilliance, high, bright, and full of strength, unmatched by others. This is the inheritance of Yingxiu, truly superb. The line "Wo ben shi Wolonggang san dan de ren" (I am originally a leisurely person from Wolonggang) is extremely good, not from the Yu School. The "ren" character is sung at a high pitch. The "baoding qiankun" (secure the universe) adds a "le" after the "ding" character. After "xia Nanyang" (go to Nanyang), the "yang" character changes to a weak "pin" sound, not in accordance with Yingxiu's old rules. The tempo of Er Liu is generally the same, receiving the most applause. People praise its elegance, but I find it too flowery. In Zhan Su (Killing Su), the use of a high pitch in "nan xiao hen" (difficult to dispel hatred) is also not easy. Although this play by Fuying is largely perfect, it inevitably has minor flaws. No one else can sing it to this extent. Shuyan has not been able to sing it for a long time, and Jupeng's singing style has changed. Fuying must be allowed to dominate. The Catching and Releasing Cao starts from the Guandi Hall. The singing of Chen Gong in the Guandi Hall is an old tune. I once learned it from the old performers Chen Fusheng and Wang Yufang. Now, listening to Fuying, he has changed the old tune. The ending Allegro becomes "tightening up then relaxing," I don't know who started this trend. In Killing Home, the line "xia de wo san hun qi po mang" (frightened my three souls and seven spirits) is very good. The tempo of the section "Chen Gong xin zhong si dao zha" (Chen Gong's heart is like being stabbed by a knife) is too fast. In the scene of killing Lu, the "gong" in "Chen Gong" uses the original pitch in a croaking tone, muffled and not bright. The "jia" in "ni yi jia da xiao" (your entire family) is unusually high and resonant, like a unique peak protruding, soaring into the sky, extremely brilliant, truly powerful, unmatched by others. The section "ting ta yan" (listen to his words) has a good domestic tone, but the enunciation is not correct. Adding a "ya" character after "qin jie yu ta" (diligently solve it for him) uses Shuyan's singing method, which is not good. The line "yi lun ming yue" (a round bright moon) is entirely the same as Shuyan's singing method. The "xia" character uses a florid tone, which feels lacking in calmness. It is best to adhere to Tan's method. In the final scattered beat, the "cha" character in "zuo shi cha" (doing things poorly) uses the "diao shang" mode, which proves that he still has strength to spare, which is commendable.</p>
<p>Other performers such as Ha Baoshan, who plays Wang Ping in Empty City and Lü Boshe in Catching and Releasing, give it their all, counting as the best of the best. Wang Quankui plays Sima Yi in the Empty City and Cao Cao in Catching and Releasing, with Cao Cao being better. In particular, the singing in the Guandi Hall scene is truly rooted and organized. Among the Jing roles with a high-pitched voice, this person is undoubtedly the best. If his voice were louder, he could rival Jin Shaoshan. Ye Shengmao's performance as Ma Su in Empty City, especially his face, is excellent. He also has a good voice and can become a famous Jing in the future. Ci Ruiquan's Chou role is one of the few remaining. It's a pity that I saw him performing with various famous actors in Chunming during the early Republic of China. Now, more than twenty years later, he first played the messenger three times in Empty City. Few people recognized him, but when he changed to playing the old soldier, people began to notice him. However, he is already very old, and his voice cannot resonate loudly. Ji Yanfen and Chen Lifen play the Dongfang sisters in Rainbow Pass, with excellent figures and eyebrows. Their performance is also experienced, and their appearance is quite similar to Zhu Qinxin. Jiang Miaoxiang often comes to Shanghai, which is universally appreciated and will not be repeated here.</p>
<h3>Lane Houses on Stage</h3>
<p>— Feifei</p>
<p>The Performance of "Under the Eaves of Shanghai"</p>
<p>This is the latest attempt by playwright Xia Yan. It is a new expression technique never before used on the Chinese drama stage. "Under the Eaves of Shanghai," which depicts the life of Shanghai people, has changed its set design from separate scenes to three-dimensional. What appears here is a lane house in a working-class area, and this lane house is directly blasted onto the stage. The parlor, kitchen, pavilion room, front building, back building, and three-story loft are all faithfully placed in front of the audience. The audience is like living in this lane house, seeing the activities of everyone in this house. Here there is the sorrow of unemployment, the pain of unrequited love, the life of prostitutes, and the ups and downs of life. What is expressed here is completely reality.</p>
<p>Xia Yan originally wrote this script for well-equipped amateur theater groups. Due to the interruption of amateur activities because of the war, this new type of play has not been able to be performed by small theater groups with insufficient strength. This time, the Shanghai Drama Society finally began this most difficult task. Taking the set design as an example, the original set designers could not complete it and hired an architectural engineer to build it. The scale of the project and the amount of money spent are self-evident. "Under the Eaves of Shanghai" will be performed next Tuesday. The uniqueness of this play will inevitably attract people's attention.</p>
