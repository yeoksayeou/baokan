<p>社評</p>
<h3>美日戰否問題</h3>
<p>以世界戰爭爲觀點，在目前國際之間，確乎貼近了戰爭漩渦，堪稱爲問題的國家者，有土耳其與希臘，有美國，有蘇聯。這數國，於其意願上，政策上，以及其所努力的方嚮上、絕無疑義的，與戰爭爆發之前的中國英國，完全一樣、總望避免戰爭；但終於能吾異乎中英兩國而避免戰爭？還是不免步武中英後塵，被逼至於不得不從事戰爭？誰都無法預料。蘇聯態度自是其中重要關鍵之一，而牽涉最廣，影響最大的，首推美國。美國以最大決心，最高勇氣，準備着應付兩洋戰爭，而以目前情勢而論，焦點不在大西洋而在太平洋；質言之，所亟不在對德義而在對日本。在德義日三國盟的公布前後的一霎那，日本朝野在呼着不辭與美一決雌雄：及至美國對盟的的反應，顯示其强毅激昂之後，白本在態忽爾歛跡；國際之皮相者，因此遽以爲日本軟化了，殆將暫安雌伏；其實，這小過是日本種種作態中的一態，不足視爲化軟變雌的證據。日本朝野始終沒有表示過，能尊重國際秩序，能尊重他國利益，始終沒有接受過美國維護條的原狀的提議；即使姿態見軟，亦祗是姿態而已。自原則上說，日本一天不修正其態度，即一天不知軟化其事實行動，則美日關係由對立尖銳而逼至交戰的因素，即一天無望其消弭。</p>
<p>然則在美國强毅激昂之餘，日本究竟有無硬幹的胆力，亦即究竟終於軟乎不軟？昨報傳載美國舊金山電訉。日本新任駐智利大使石井道經舊金山時，聲稱『美日之戰爭，乃屬不可能之事，蓋日本參加軸心聯盟的目的，即在避免美日間的衝突』；又謂「美目合作，尚有許多途徑可循，且有充分的時間。得以覓致改善目前的一切困難』；石井且聲明此項談話，乃奉外相松岡的訓令而發表，以表示凡所云云，不是一個外交官員隨便談談的外交辭令，而是日本外交當局的見解，惟其爲外相松岡所訓令發表，又逢美國態度日趨堅決而積極，美日關係日趨緊張的時候，吾們便値得稍加體味。體味所得，不難發見其說蓋有幾種不同解釋的可能。日本惟恐美國堅持其政策，繼續其對於中英兩國的援助，馴致美國對德義或對日木竟因利害牴牾而發生戰爭；於楚日不與德義締結盟約，企圖喝止美國的昂進，遮斷美國的力援；日本滿望這一企圖如願以償，斯與德義締盟的因果即是避免美日戰爭。，於此說來、石井奉命發表的談話，倒也不失其爲披肝瀝胆之談，世人得由石井談話而如見日本肺肝，這是一種解釋。事實上，日本與德義締盟後，美國旣以數種强有力的新行動，作爲答復了；美國自大總統國務卿陸海軍部長乃至報章論述，社會輿情，亦已揭穿日本締盟的企圖，表示憤怒了；如此對於日本朝野旣已無異於面命耳提，不容東京外相曁其駐外使節，假作痴聾而謂締盟乃係避免對美戰爭的好意了；然而松岡猶命石井如此云云，殆因知所忌憚，乃步得不憣然變計，從事與强颜掩飾其原來的企圖，而更企圖使美人息怒，日本自動開始了緩和美國感情，緩和美日國交的工作；行見此爲軟化其事實行動的先聲，請求美國外交轉圜的示意；這是又一解釋。由前一解，日本雖所作爲足以激發美日戰爭，但其本意衹是癡心妄想，虛聲恫嚇，並不想與美交戰。由後一解，日本鑒於與美交戰的不利而惟恐或戰，遂轉變其態度與政策。</p>
<p>這類解釋，誰能信任，誰能滿足？</p>
<p>石井奉命發表的談話之中，殆僅一語，可視爲眞實意嚮所在，即所謂充分的時間；而談話的動因，大的更在企圖時間的延長，以迄美日國交的最後決定。蓋德義日三國宣布同盟之後，美國的軍事布置，外交活動，經濟調度，眞有高視闊步，劍及屨及的氣槪；而英國對美國，亦能協力同心，並駕齊驅；循此動態的方嚮，進展的速度，顯見即在最近將來、具有發動任何大規模的新作爲之可能；這是日本所窘於應付，無法消受的。日本當局或因利令智昏，好大喜功，或因歷年對於人民的宣傳蒙蔽。勢如騎虎，故雖來自美國方面的磨阻當前，却不知悔，亦小能自返，於是還想借車外交辭令，佈爲軟性烟幕，試施麻醉，冀由時間的騰挪，以獲得充分的時間。抑時間有何濟，又何待？一曰，猶望美國持續其空疎的言行，俾日本得對於中國遂行其武功，完成其侵略。二曰，猶望美國一切作爲，停滯於現堦段，俾德義先將英國打倒。二者要旨，無非滿望時間可濟其窮，許德義與日本，對整個國際，貫徹其各個擊破的策略；滿望美人寬容，美國顢預，接受日本柔聲軟態的詭辯，而竟假以時間。誠哉，日本在中國用武，若得確定的勝利之後，英國被德義打得一敗墮地，帝國崩潰之後，美國對中英兩國，對整個變局勢必愛莫能助，徒喚奈何。那時候，松岡不必訓令石井取銷此項談話，自得恢復其猙獰本相：對美國何所憚而不挑戰，又何所爲而求避免戰爭！總之，日本不悟，則美日國交必不能復；美國及今不作有效的制止，則日本必不知悟，亦即美日交戰祗剩時間問題；而今日的日本，惟望美國予以選擇最有利於日本對美作戰的機會。</p>

<h3>丈夫患賢虧之癥症　閨房不融洽空氣爲之惡化</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌醫師</p>
<p>性能健康能融洽夫婦倆的個性　否則不論任何一方都受到打擊</p>
<p>性慾在人們日常生活上，握著很大很深的潛勢力。牠能支配環境。安慰枯寂的生活到快樂而幸福的境界，並能融洽夫婦兩個的個性，互助互愛，共同維持家庭之和平。此外對於一切的進化，蕃殖人類等等問題，那一樣可以缺少性慾呢？</p>
<p>性能雖爲人類的一種本能，可說健康的人，沒有人會缺少此性機能者，若此性的機能有何病態，卽屬賢虧無疑。丈夫一旦腎虧之後，不論丈夫的自身，其妻子那面都要感到一種很學生的打擊，因性機能的缺陷，往往使愛情良好的伉儷們，頓變仇恨，症狀嚴重者，惟有出於離婚之一途。</p>
<p>賢虧一症，患著的男女，正不知有多少。的確已成了個很嚴重的問題，障碍的種類，有很多種類，如陰萎，遺精，早洩，不妊等等，都是使患者非常的苦悶。</p>
<p>講到腎虧的治療，祇要能增進主宰性慾青春腺的繁榮，促進新陳代謝之機能，即可恢復健康，故對症治法，惟有進服德國眞正青春腺素製劑男用「補體康」。方能藥到病除，蓋吾人之睪丸，爲內分泌液的一種，內分泌之作用，乃排泄他的分泌夜到血液中，運送週身，調節全身之興衰，維持身體之繁榮，彼房事過度，手淫斷傷而來之腎虧早洩，陰萎不育等症，服睪丸（即青春腺）內分泌製劑男用「補體康」之後，即可補賢，補腦，補血，見效如神，其女用用調經種子之功，備爲醫師所信賴。</p>
<h3>最新遺精療法舉例</h3>

<p>遺精療法，雖有多種，但最爲吾輩醫師所實騐有效者，首推內服劑之運用，不過市上遺精藥種類太多，其中成分亦各不同，其中最佳者，首推德國「耐而斯遺精片」，今特舉其一例，以證明其功效。</p>
<p>患者夏君，年十九歲，於十六歲時即犯手淫，旋感遺精，滑精，發育不全，頭痛失眠等症。雖遍服市上成藥，絕無效療，旋由醫師處方服以「耐而斯遺精片」三片，每日僅服一次（在睡前），並兼服德國睪丸內分泌製劑以補虧損，一日三次，經過一個月之後，不僅遺精永止，且發育增進，腦力也爲之一爽，足證該兩劑爲遺精最對证的治法。</p>

<h3>如何肅清蔓延極速之淋菌</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士王克春</p>
<p>我人身體，是整個的，牽一髮而動全身，故某一部分被病菌的攻入，卽全身感到痛楚，一般人以爲淋病，乃是局部問題，而療法方面，亦僅注意局部的殺菌，忽略其全部問題，於是造成許多只有惡劣反應而無殺菌力的劣藥，蓋市上許多劣藥，均不過著眼於透膜殺菌，而且此種殺菌的功效祇是暫時的，表面的功效。而絕無實際的，根本的效力，余於多年來參考歐美各國醫最新驅淋物資藥不得不推德國彼德博士所發表之最新化學療法　「克淋儂」，此劑係根據以驅除淋病爲單位之化學療法之原理，此劑以純粹撲滅淋菌爲目的，與其他連帶治淋之化學療法，實不可同日而語，因此「克淋儂」之殺菌力極其强大，而絕無其化學療法之反應。故凡急慢性淋病如淋毒性前後尿道炎，睪丸炎，攝護腺炎，關節炎，膀胱炎等症，服「克淋儂」皆有優秀卓效。其成績在百分之九十八以上。對於蔓延極速之淋菌，與十分可怕的淋菌毒素，服「克淋儂」（各大藥房有售）皆有非常的實效</p>

<h3>觀「西綫影片」　活得史跡與悲歡的印象</h3>
<p>駐華德大使館情報專員柯德君，於昨日下午三時半，在大西路德國學堂招待報界，並試映西綫戰事影片。首由柯君起立致詞，略謂與諸君小別以來，眷念殊甚，茲又歡叙一室，曷勝欣幸！今日特以德軍在西綫各國作戰經過之影片放映，供諸君快覩。至其內容如何，看後自能明暸，鄙人亦無庸辭費。此次放映各片，更繫以簡單之華文說明，措詞解釋，是吾達意，還乞明達指示，以臻完滿云云。語畢，燈光全熄，震驚世人之德國「閃電戰」，卽開始呈映於銀幕上矣。</p>
<p>此所謂「西綫影片」與德使館前此所放映者，村料較爲豐富，雖亦係新聞片性質，經剪接後，在大體上已成一完整之故事。主要材料爲德軍侵荷。比·法之經過，中間又雜以挪威之防禦戰，義大利之對英宜戰，及北海之海戰等。自德軍攻陷荷海港鹿丹特起，至法軍屈服而在貢巴臬森林中與德方簽訂停戰條件止，足可映兩小時。餘此諸役戰事所包括之時聞，爲五月十一日德軍開始以傘兵攻鹿丹特而至六月二十日法德雙方簽定和的，前後恰爲一個月零九天也。</p>
<p>德軍之進犯西歐，其作風先以第五縱隊搖動人心，並爲內應之伏綫，然後由空中放下傘兵，突入敵陣後方，繼之以排砲轟擊飛機投彈，最後以機械化部隊保護步兵衝鋒，當者披靡，攻城陷市，乃成指顧間事。故在銀慕上放映時，除第五縱隊之活動未之得見外，其他「閃電戰」之方程式，則固大同而小異。西綫影片開映之第一個鏡頭，卽爲飛機塲中機羣由跑道上昇，軋軋之聲，震發自幕上。霎時間傘兵下降，巨大傘蓋，冉冉自天而下。旣着地，各兵卽組成一小隊，開始在敵人陣後進襲。栘時巨砲怒吼，飛機轟炸步兵隨機械化部隊，蜂擁而至，而鹿丹特之守軍，卽於幕上出現，搖白旗乞降矣。</p>
<p>德軍之侵魯文，攻鄧扣克，入巴黎，均爲西綫片」中精彩之處。其入巴黎一幕，軍容壯盛，福煦大道上德統帥勃勞希將軍檢閱自香藹利大街而來之德國軍隊，其畫面以凱旋門爲背景，德攝影師得意之作也另有一個鏡頭，爲凱旋門前舉行授勳式及歐戰陣亡將士墓前之「長明火」，火光熊熊，炎舌騰騰，了無變異，畏眠於此墓中之健兒俠骨，乃不知德軍鐵蹄已臨故土，亦可悲已。</p>
<p>自德法兩元首在明興（卽慕尼黑）會晤之熱鬧情形完畢後，此片已趨於尾聲，將結束之一段，卽爲貢巴臬森林中之一幕悲劇。（參看本報歐戰叢談十）先是希特勒於軍中聞貝當表示停戰乞和消息，其一種躊躇滿志之狀態，誠有不覺手之舞足之蹈之者，—片中示希氏忽而伸兩臂，旋又舉右足作極輕快之旋轉返身式—又其於林中與戈林上將散步時，一種閒逸莫逆之情緻，活躍畫面。在此殺人如麻慘痛萬分之戰事片中，得此兩個鬆動之景象，亦殊難能可貴也！貢巴臬森林廣塲前，停餐車一輛，希特勒與季台爾上將等上車求久，法代表亦施施而來。旋希氏先下車，樂聲大作，挾其戰勝之光榮，駛車返德。一面則爲法代表之下車，步入廣塲旁之小蓬帳中，有德方將校一人爲伴。法代表四人入帳後，此德將校卽將慕門拉上，於是觀者頓失此四位代表所在，實則若輩方與維希方面以電話磋商德方所授予之停戰條件，其慘痛可想而知。德將校之一個小小拉「幕」動作，寗不令人有不勝其嘆惜者乎？</p>
<p>六時一刻，全片映畢，滿室重見光明，參觀者爲之欣然，蓋以兩小時之緊張空氣，至此始獲蘇息也。</p>

<h3>控制區迭有血案　日方苛密搜檢　嚴峻煩瑣爲前次所未有　愚園路北區最近始開放　南市昨被搜查居民多被驚擾</h3>
<p>字林報云、日憲兵一名、上星期五日在愚園路畔被刺殞命、日軍當局旋在該地突施封鎖、致使愚園路以北之區、與外界隔絕者、的歷二十四小時、至昨（二十日）夜五時三十分、始撤除封鎖、而該區居民之不寗與惶慮、亦吿終止、</p>
<p>食物給養　均遭截斷</p>
<p>在此一晝夜封鎖期間、可通往日憲兵被刺地點之愚園路六六八街與六〇八衖內、華籍住戶之食物等給養、均被截斷、並有少數外僑之牛乳、麵包與報紙、亦被阻未能送釗、先是上述兩街、自星期五日起、卽由「市警」駐守、</p>
<p>弄內華人　均禁通行</p>
<p>至星期六夜間父有日憲兵數隊開到、不發警告、卽在入口處架置有刺鐵絲網障礙物、行人交通、皆苦阻斷、直至昨晚始已、日兵對於外僑、未有干涉希圖、僅一度似有哨兵誤解其所接命令、而對某外僑有阻撓行動、但華人皆不能通行、</p>
<p>挨戶售旗　着水淋漓</p>
<p>當初該處並無搜查隊出現、故衆皆不解日方此舉動機何在、直至將近午刻、有日兵與「市警」一小隊、在該兩衖排戶「出售」日方與寗方旗幟各一、並勒令居民將兩旗同懸門上或房上顯明處、居民本以非至捕獲刺客、卽無食物可得爲慮、午後又被强迫購旗懸掛、適細雨濛濛、旗幟着水、狼狽萎頽、不知日當局係因犬雨、抑因自知不能捕獲刺客、乃於傍晚突然撤除封鎖、人夜、卽有食物等源源携人、</p>
<p>搜查苛密　前所未見</p>
<p>自傳筱庵與日憲兵伍長齋籐先後被刺殞命，一週來、上海日當局在其控制區內、實施有系統的搜查行人車輛、其嚴格爲過去一年來所未見、虹口方面近所採取之辦法、殊爲嚴峻、斐倫路橋上、駐有日海軍陸戰隊士兵、搜查行人車輛、以防私藏武器、已歷數日、行人抵此、列成長行、挨次被搜查、須待長久時間、始能經過、</p>
<p>虹口交通　異常擁擠</p>
<p>乘汽車與人力車者、亦皆被迫下車受搜查、入晚、由便衣日人代日陸戰隊士兵搜查不懈、虹口方面公共汽車與乘客、亦同樣遭搜查、故交通擁擠異常、至昨日搜查始見寬弛、</p>
<p>認爲刺客　匿居某屋</p>
<p>又英文大美晚報云、據日當局稱、日方因信狙擊日憲兵之刺客三人、逸人愚園路六〇八街、匿於某屋中、故自星期五晚起封鎖該衖云、估計該衖居民的有四千人、日憲兵被刺案發生後、日當局卽在愚園路「歹土」區大肆搜查、</p>
<p>南市搜查</p>
<p>法租界毗連南市各處之鐵門、如斜橋·南陽橋·東新橋·新開河等處所駐日兵、及所謂「警士」、於昨晨黎明六時起、對進出行人、均施予嚴密搜查、凡市民未携「市民證」者、均被阻於鐵門外、不准進出、一時被阻者數百人、住於南市居民、欲經過鐵門進入租界者、亦遭阻折回、而一部份新近遷入南市者、均無「市民證」、莫不驚慌失措、被阻不能入租界、至此次日方突施檢查原因、一說傳筱庵被刺後、嚴緝在逃兇犯、一說係滬西暗殺日軍官一名所致、</p>

<h3>金融　現金不做做期貨　烚赤軋空軋扁了空頭　半月一期恢復了期貨　昨日爲此特停市一天</h3>
<p>自標金市塲在八二三時停市後，卽由金業交易所從業員組設烚赤市塲，在某銀號內從事買賣，當時參加交易者僅有銀樓幫十二家，金號五家，及錢兌業等二十餘家，市價升降，常隨外滙爲轉栘。但最近一反常例，外滙趨鬆，而烚赤背馳，頻見上漲，形成過去一週之軋空風潮，自十四日起至十九日止，空方無日不在軋空之下，忍痛了結，推究原因，主要者的有三點：</p>
<p>（一）上海游資充斥，無法運用，自「五二」風潮後，對於囤積貨物投機外股，漸乏興趣，而扒結外匯，亦因太平洋上情形變幻莫測，不敢落手，故大都轉移目標，競購烚赤，允以港地搜　爲甚。同　自銀行减息後，擁有齊財者，認爲與其將法幣存在銀行中，不如易爲黃金藏在保管箱中爲妥。</p>
<p>（二）太平洋上局勢雖然變幻莫測，而大體利空以故賣空者甚多　以前浮空或浮多如無力收解；同業中能情商緩交，現在則因數額過大，不能通融。</p>
<p>（三）投機者對於時局，見仁見智，各有看法，因之有實力之多頭暗中互相聯結，抬價搜購，以遂操縱市面之伎倆，故對空方大加壓力，扣緊烚赤籌碼，不予放出，俾市價大漲之後，乘高出籠，以故十九日市價高達五千九百元時，銀樓幫卽有實貨流出。</p>
<p>以上海有限之烚赤籌碼，經各方無窮之搜購，與夫多頭之操縱軋空，市價自然飛騰而與外匯背馳。市塲方面因軋空情形紊亂已極，故十九日決定以該日午收盤爲止，所有交易，概照美匯五·八四三七五）十九日收盤行市）結價，的合烚赤五千九百八十四元（亦作九十元，又作八十九元二角）多空一併了結。竟比十九日收盤價加起一百六十元之數，依此價空方吃虧甚大，故昨日父經冉定辦法，無論實貨收解或以結價了結，一律依照十九日午收盤價五千八百三十元多空了結淸楚，因之昨日烚赤未曾開做。同時決定於今日起開做期貨，每半月了結，若到期無貨交割，可貼利轉期，卽恢復前標金市塲交易方法，至於保證金規定每條四百一元，已定於今日（　十二日照常開市。（聖）</p>
<h3>外期現　幾相軋平</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、匯電掛牌、悉無上落、英美滙暗市、走勢穩平、初以紗花幫及英美烟公司、稍有結款、略形軟化、惟期貨價與現貨一度軋平、後市華行塞出、需要轉少、市面遂吿回鬆、結果較上星期六不分軒輊、期貨與現貨仍微有拔開、</p>
<h3>紗花幫結期美匯</h3>
<p>晨初以滙兌、英對　滬等均平、美對英未更、對滬大三分、對法無市中央掛牌各　如舊、銀行晨開、現貨賣價、英金三辦士七九六八七五、美滙五元八四三七五、較之上星期六收市、英美兩滙俱平、開後投機商吐售如前、本月份美滙外行收人投機商計五元八四三七五、　有紗花幫來市結進期貨美匯、因此市面帶軟、十一月份美國紗花幫進有利爲五元八　一五、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉、亦無增减、此後英美烟公司、亦稍購入遠月美匯、十二月份某美行塞出爲五元八一二五、迨至午刻、投機商見勢跟扒、本月份美滙俱吿五元八一二五、收盤價期現軋平、英金三辦士七八一二五、美匯五元八一二五、比晨開英緊〇五六·五、美縮〇三一二五、</p>
<h3>午後華商又猛售</h3>
<p>午後華行猛售、市面硬化、計東亞售予某美行及有利本月份美滙五元八四三七五、惟以後市面極靜、交易不多、收盤價英金三辦士七九六八七五、美滙五元八四三七五、本月份與現貨同價、下月份英金三辦士七八一二五、美滙五元八一二五、比上週末收、英美匯均毫無榮辱、</p>
<h3>香港匯價殊平穩</h3>
<p>香　廿一日（週一）電、今　匯市開盤平穩英日及申匯均無變動、（申匯上週六午收爲三百九十二元、）美滙現貨鬆〇六二五、爲廿三元〇六二五、午收申匯現貨升一元、爲三百九十三元、下午二時三十分開盤平穩、美匯現貨緊〇六二五、爲廿三元、其餘不動、</p>
<h3>天津英美俱鬆動</h3>
<p>天津廿一日（週一）電、今晨匯市開盤吿半、倫敦電匯鬆〇三一二五、爲三便士六五六一五、紐約電匯硬〇六二五、爲五元六五六二五、申滙降角五分、爲一百〇〇四元、（聯鈔）暗盤亦昂二角五分、爲七十七元五角、</p>
<h3>英鎊票忽有需要</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤無市、塲外喊價略疲、故英美金鎊因亦一致下落一元、英金票忽有需　、市價趨漲一元、美金票盤旋於十六元五角三分及六角四分間、卒爲十六元五角半、比上週六微漲一分、香港票供求均勻、市價站平、日金票及朝鮮票趨勢甚挺、市價步漲、前者復高至一元四角一分、後者續升至一元一角九分、</p>
<h3>油餅　油市多空鬥法</h3>
<p>昨日食油市况、晨初承上週六收盤時之緊局、故開盤市略挫一三角、入後浮囤出籠力勁、市遂下游、最低時曾比開盤價削去一二元、至午後風傳靑島市價報砌、市氣卽回升、行情跳漲元外、結果祗小修半元左右、計成交大有廠，油四百担、價爲八十六元、跌至八十四元半、旋升至八十五元、花生油做開膠州現油五十件、價爲七十元零五角、叫禮拜交五十件、價爲七十二元、靑島油訂十一月上交二百桶、價爲一百零二元、開盤直瀉至一百元、後爲一百零一元半收盤、訂十一月下交三百桶、價爲一百零四元、跌至零三元收盤、刻下人心轉入盤旋狀態中、全日交易亦已减色、其大局有醞釀不化之勢、欲使明朗、須看搬出證問題解決、方可分多空誰勝，</p>
<p>昨日由天津來黃豆二千二百一十包、今日有豆子三百九十五包、豆餅一千六百片、麩皮二千包、高粱三百七十包、運往厦門、昨日並有桐油一千聽、自天津來、</p>
<h3>糧食　不買金子卽買米　投機奸商到處搗亂</h3>
<p>洋米昨日初漲後跌、市面仍轉平坦、緣早晨開市後、業內外浮戶鑒於金市軋現、花紗上漲、莫不盲從吸收、而一部份從事於烚赤條子交易之投機客戶、因結價停市而轉趨於米市塲、因此米市塲中頓呈活潑興旺氣象、各洋米立被買聲熱鬧而抬起半元至七八角不等、但業中行國、大戶並無顧問、間有問津者盡屬投機之搶帽子交易、實銷淸淡如故、獲利者頗有趁高塞售、故市價一漲、賣氣頓旺、市又逐步回降、及至午收則又與日前收價相接近、下午出入兩少、市無軒輊、新交易未開、回籠英華司原包二號西貢現貨開七十四元、出月交貨之路貨則爲七十三元二角、開出一百多噸、現米成交近萬包、</p>
<p>新粳尖及窰種野稻等、到貨雖屬不旺、祗共千　包、然以天雨、一般作客恐有水漬、常此新貨身骨不堅、不的而同鮮有進取、貨主抱同樣心理、亦謀急脫、致售價遂難難持、新粳計落一二元之巨、崑山貨開七十三元、閔行一帶者祗七十元、原包高貨七十六七元、至於客種及野稻、貨主以貨稀、尙圖扳持、致未做開、杜洋尖亦被帶小元許、靑角杜尖原包開六十九元、斛見六十五元、太倉羊尖原包六十九元、破粳亦僅常粳開出八十二三元、至若南港早破悉未做開、</p>
<p>糯米國洋兩貨、仍以酒戶活動堅俏異常、市價續提半元至一元、宜溧國米開七十八元、香港特元七十六元、</p>
<p>洋米不　來滬、昨日太古公司安順輪，自香港運來五十四百六十六包、又湖南輪亦自香港裝來八千四百五十七包、兩輪共裝來洋米一萬三千九百二十三包、昨晨先後抵埠、停靠法租界本行碼頭、正在起卸中、　（祖）</p>
<p>麵粉　昨日　號粉廠盤、改爲十七元、比前突漲半元、蓋自回籠貨昂貴以來、各廠以原料缺乏、成本高昂早有提漲之意、惟在租界當局、制止物價高漲及維持本街性質、故未卽加、迨至昨日、始再加價半元、而回籠貨市面、在上週末本已漸臻平和、今廠盤一加、局勢未免再緊、聞老車牌價沽十九元三四角、洋粉以定貨不繼、高牌又迫近二十元大關、但交易仍未開展、統市除兩廠　出八千餘包外、其他交易小滿五千包、</p>
<h3>原料不繼　粉盤突漲半元</h3>
<p>小麥　昨日小麥市况、沉寂如故、蓋以內地供源久稀、日廠進價限制小放、華廠限盤在二十五元、亦難接近、故每日僅有點綴解廠貨而已、聞近日外傳　廠又有新定洋麥之說、但尙未見證實云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　核桃回跌</h3>
<p>核桃因來源見旺、統共計達千數百件、故市勢驟軟、兼之前市提升過速、亦非無因、昨開出靑州桃二百件、價開八十元、降十四元、提桃一百件、八十六元、　桃肉反升、開一百二十六允</p>
<h3>紗花　港幫辦粗紗　紗市漲力强</h3>
<p>紗市復趨上升、漲力殊强、此因香港幫對於十支粗紗納胃暢健、在市搜羅殷切、以致人心激昂、投機買風允織、市乃再現新高峯、惟同業及廠方一致拋賣、而氣勢依然挺秀、二十支雙馬曾達一千二百八十五元、上日申新九廠開出二十支天女二千七百包、價爲一千一百七十元附正、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、市態平和、二十支雙馬價爲一千二百五十六元、同業大都賣出、少頃微洛至一千二百四十八元、在一千二百五十五六元、廻旋甚久、嗣後聞香　幫搜購粗紗頗旺、且售價跳起二三十元之夥、人心由是震盪、而金子幫及證券善於投機舉動、見風一致在抬、市盤直綫上騰、至一千二百八十五元、獲利多頭吐出、父回下至千一百七十六元、收盤價爲千一百八十一元、查半日間成交、統計五千七百九十包、行情漲廿元、二十日棉紗運厦鬥二十件、運香港二百四十五件、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分別如左、同行四、一一〇香港、六八〇統計五、七九〇</p>
<h3>外棉交易　日趨活躍</h3>
<p>現棉情况亦堅定、但成交仍以同業買賣、較爲繁盛、</p>
<p>MT　二八三·〇〇同行进　一三一件</p>
<p>苏重而　二六八·〇〇又　一〇〇件</p>
<p>特白洛去二五三·〇〇新生進　一〇〇件</p>
<p>細絨打包二六〇·〇〇又　二七八件</p>
<p>北太倉　二一五·〇〇同行進　六〇〇包</p>
<p>草包</p>
<p>二〇六·〇〇又　三〇〇包</p>
<p>平果爾　一六五·〇〇</p>
<p>一六四·〇〇又　四〇〇件</p>
<p>一六六·〇〇</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、市况靜寂、同業稍有購買、嗣後則因南方幫之套賣、結果收盤價格、較之上日跌一二磅昔、印度連同預測漲一羅比餘、</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉交易、日來日趨活躍、奈因市上存底不豐、故交易未能大量之做開、同業方面訂購裝船貨者甚多、俟此項定貨到埠時、棉價始可稍後也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　港粵動辦國布　有疋頭運港轉仰光</h3>
<p>國布　昨市趨勢堅昂、乃因粤港幫需胃轉旺、同業心思生意傾向買進、晨盤頗少軒輊、富貴細斜喊售三十元零六七角、尙無多大交易、後市需要激增、步引至三十一元、富貴細布卅三元、其他細布細斜漂布亦俱喊高每疋二角半至五角、粗布漲每疋一角至二角半、本街成交坯布粗細布斜紋漂染布等一千餘件、粤港幫辦色布色斜三百數十件、浙閩幫亦辦色布細　等二百餘件、烟津幫辦藍布粗布一百餘件、</p>
<p>東布　始疲終堅、收盤時尤形挺秀、細布細斜較上週升漲每疋五角之譜、嗶嘰漲每碼分許、十二磅龍頭細布收盤價三十八元三角半、四君子嗶嘰一元　角六分二厘半、</p>
<p>出口　今有疋頭一百八十件、運港轉仰光、九百五十件運香港、父五十七件運厦門、</p>
<h3>呢絨下檔居俏</h3>
<p>呢絨　勢堅穩、銷路零躉均健男女色與裏襯等、交易皆頗繁盛、客幫因交通阻滯、及受統制關係、雖有設法運輸、而爲數不多、因之十之七八俱靠本街一隅所銷出、綜窺目前百貨高漲時代、呢絨亦步　塵、但其購買力漸見减弱、因此造成下檔貨居俏子餘元一碼之呢絨、不論厚薄、合於中裝及西裝者、銷路大轉活躍、而來路賤價之下檔者、往年早已搜羅一空、申織本廠貨、尙有下檔者、餘剩與出品耳、昨美綸聖誕老人海力司及板四呢、齊批沽十一元、公大十三元至十四元、章華制服呢九元二角半、大業醒獅圖單幅四元五角、大衣呢雙幅十二元半、海林棒雙幅十三元半、大業呢單幅二元二角、</p>
<h3>海味　生粉去化轉活</h3>
<p>生粉近日去化轉活、而底存亦漸稀少、勢乃堅挺、刻市已漲起五元、計飛麒麟標售七十元、人槍二X、KG、三標同售六十九元、鐵錨牌六十元、雙T標五十七元、三號紛爲四十六元、價較初盤回跌十餘元</p>
<h3>香山尾湧到　價較初盤回跌十餘元</h3>
<p>兩洋蝦尾、如香山貨來源見湧、如昨日售開者爲四百一十元、貨品至佳、惟較之初盤、須跌去四十餘元、然銷路尙可、後市可望底定、</p>
<h3>糖市　車赤白步鬆　本續四元</h3>
<p>昨糖市以外滙續長、再度鬆落、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白本棧七十四元七角、外棧七十四元二角、轉口貨五十九元、均鮮更動、受手不多、荷赤續降八角、初爲五十六元、權降至五十五元八角及五角、太古車白B嘜西棧七十二元七角、小三角、東棧七十二元五角、至七十二元、小八角、CW嘜西棧七十二元二角、小三角、DY嘜六十八元三角、小八角、HX嘜六十八元三角至六十八元、降七至一元、H嘜車赤五十五元、降一元、本廠白冰因粗砂步跌多日、未有成交、昨有開出一號冰爲九十四元半、晶明冰九十六元、前後須降四元、國糖來源均乏、號貨亦無開出、且存底亦已不多、</p>
<h3>五金　市面向榮</h3>
<p>新盤元　交易甚旺、製釘廠。鉛絲廠。及螺絲廠等、相率收辦、囤戶幫亦多點綴、昨成交一千餘担、每担價自五十六元五角至五十七元二角半不一、其價比前已提加一元有奇、查此貨存底　甚充斥、然其成本均在六十元出關、所以同業方面、均在扳價、且洋行現貨已經售罄、故此後市面、當有步步高陞之氣象也，</p>
<p>會同織　印鐵廠·熱水瓶廠·玩具廠以及餅干廠等、昨市爭相收進、且市上流通貨不多、故市氣甚膨脹、據海外定價因兵險水脚加高關係、其行情已回高至九元七角半、（美金）、合之最近外滙、其行形要一百八十元出關、比之申市高出十元之多、因此執貨不肯廉售、後市情形甚爲樂觀也、</p>
<h3>藥材　大草仁轉升</h3>
<p>大草仁近乏續到、而高貨較缺、故身份足乾之貨、好起五元、現市需八十元、惟潮次者受手寥寥、雖低廉亦乏受主云、</p>
<h3>證券　內債屢見新高價　——亦是一時之風雲際會</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨市更見飛黃騰達、丙種曾穿出六十元大關、戊種亦達六十元新高價、各種行市無一不見最高紀錄、又爲八一三以後最新紀錄、趨勢之猛進得未曾有、蓋以昨日金子市塲發生問題、未能開市、因此般投機份子羣集於公債市塲、勢力雄厚、而其背景又有新借款五千萬美元爲之撑持、一時風雲際會、興高彩烈、集會人驟見擁擠、買氣高漲、市塲充滿多頭心思、午後有某銀行賣出三四十萬、高峯稍稍受挫、一時多頭隨之出籠者頗不乏人、但仍能維持相當高價、前途或將小起回風、再向新高價邁　、昨日上午震康首先買進、仁昌茂泰樂茂繼之、胡鶴記恒孚聯益等亦從事搜羅、雖有鴻大怡泰大量供給、無濟於事、各債均見新高價、午後久豐聯益同康生大等均奮勇買進、一時丙種衝出六十元大關、戊種亦達六十元、於是松茂代某銀　賣出戊種三四十萬元、一時籌碼充裕、各幫賣氣漸重、鴻大再事賣出、大通同順信孚均有賣出、市價乃爲之壓小三五角、但收盤價多數仍在上午收盤價之上、結果惟丁種獨漲一元六角爲最多、餘均漲七八角不等、成交總數共計的二百萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>編者的話</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>關於受過高等敎育的婦女回家庭去是不是犧牲的問題，過去已經刋載過好幾篇文章。最近因爲發表了一些應時文章，同時因爲討論婦女問題的來稿比較擁擠，整理需時的關係，所以已經停了幾次。現在稿件已經整理完竣，可是因爲自由談篇幅狹小，又不便把全部的篇幅用來談論婦女的出路，因此祇能比較嚴格地選出一部份稿件來陸續地發表。我們將特別注重婦女們自己的意見與切身經騐。</p>
<p>關於「是不是犧牲」的問題，陳銘先生又來了一篇『再談犧牲』，聲明他的「原意並不是主張所有的婦女都該走上家庭的一條路去』，他「承認婦女在社會上應該和男人佔一樣的地位，不過在目前（以及最近的將來）家庭制度尙不能取消或變更的前提之下，一大部份婦女自動的或被動的回到家庭里去盡她的責任，應該也是一種事業，而不應該認爲是犧牲。』並且提到把家務全部交給傭人的不可靠。</p>
<p>關於這一點，徐健女士覺得社會服務與治家是可以兼顧的，並且有事實可以證明。</p>
<p>阿顰女士的『爲他人生活』，描寫一個女子在舊家庭中的痛苦，以及自由後的奮發努力，她的寳貴意見，是特別値得我們注意的。</p>
<p>家庭</p>
<h3>爲他人生活</h3>
<p>— 阿顰</p>
<p>我旣不是出身某大學，或某中學，又不曾在社會上有何活動，只是一個剛在小學讀了五年書就被送入大家庭，被舊禮敎緊緊束縛了六年的不幸的</p>
<p>在大家庭中，允其是略有資產和還留着封建遺害的大家庭中，做一個媳婦所受的壓迫和痛苦，是非言語所能形容的。公婆嚴厲的臉色，妯娌的傾軋，小姑的刁難，傭人的暗欺，在在使一個十七歲的我感到莫大的痛苦。我的身體是公婆的，而不是丈夫的。小夫妻除了夜間偷偷談幾句外，其他時間絕對不許交談，卽使我勉勵丈夫求點知識，或糾正一點過錯，「怕老婆」「雌老虎」等雅號就加到我倆頭匕。奉承公婆，拍妯娌馬庇，替小姑做差使，是我的功課。我不爲自己，不爲丈夫，更不能爲孩子，一天到夜惡來爲去是公姜·小姑·妯娌，整天笑臉相陪，稍一不謹，就是「不孝」的大罪名，別說到社會活動，速出大鬥也不容易。我只機械地茫然地爲他人生活而已！</p>
<p>轟的一聲，大砲響了，家產被燬了，封建式的大家庭不能再束縛我。我和我的丈夫孩子們在砲火連天中悄然地來到上海，開了一爿僅能餬口的小店，雖然受着經濟壓迫，但我到底自由了。</p>
<p>自由後第一要事，是再求知識，我知道淺鄙的學識是不能適應未來的社會，雖然六年的緊束，把我養成林黛玉型的弱質女子，而家道中落後的銀根拮据，財力上，精神上，都不許我更求多的知識，但我揀了適合我個性的課程補習着，努力地自修着，以備將來應用。</p>
<p>並不是六年來大家庭的束縛引起的厭惡而不贊成希特勒式的把婦女關到家庭裏去的派頭，實在是我由衷地感覺我們女子守着古舊的理想，埋身在家庭裏，決不能適合現代的潮流。至少是在安定後，受了血的洗禮後的中國，需要大量國民去負起建國責任，我們也是國民的一份子，我們對於祖國也負有同樣的責任，佔着人口半數的女同胞們，在這國難重重之秋，我們應該怎樣的自勉呵！等到社會需要我們的時候，我們可振臂奮發替我們大中華造成完美的國家，替我們女子打開一條光明的大道！去做比安慰丈夫撫養孩子還要重大的工作！</p>
<p>婦女</p>
<h3>可以兼顧</h3>
<p>— 徐健</p>
<p>一個家庭的組織，不一定如一般未婚男女所想像的那末簡單；誠然，敎育子女，管理繁複的家務，在今日社會，尙未有托兒所，公共食堂創辦以前，這是婦女們放不下的擔子；做妻子，做母親的，爲着社會上的工作，卽脫離家庭，拋棄家庭，置家庭於不顧，當然也是要不得的。但如專爲着要敎養孩子，使家庭裏整整齊齊，而要女子的全部精神葬下去，認爲是婦女的事業，這亦未免太殘忍一點！在「男女平等」，「婦女解放」的呼號下，我們幸運的一部份，已能得到與男子在同一座位上受知識的灌漑，得社會地培植與重視。那末到「學有成就」以後，就應當與男子同樣地貢獻出所有能力，報效給國家與社會。我們儘可以一方面持家，敎育子女，但另一方面，還得要上社會去工作。</p>
<p>也許有一都分的人，要想我在說夢話，但是，且慢着；事實是最有理由的證人。我本人就生長在這樣的家庭裏，父親前後任職於敎育界，新聞界，政界而沒有賦閒過，而我的母親，服務於敎育有二十年的歷史，在婚前她是學生們的良師，婚後亦是，生了孩子仍舊是，她不曾因家庭而放棄過她服務社會的責任，雖然父親因顧到她的過於辛勞而耍她辭職，但她却一直沒有荒怠過。而我們的家庭，並不因母親的就職而弄得紊亂不堪。家務有一定規定以後，自成習慣，那是不難料理的。我也認識好多家庭婦女，在持家敎子之餘，盡可能的參加社會活動，她們的家庭，一樣也是井井有條。由此使我覺得，持家與就職，是可以兼任的。</p>
<p>所以我覺得，一個受過優良敎育的主婦，一個劃時代的女兒，應當有能力管理家務，敎麥子女，效勞於社會，領導大衆，使得不到光明的，重見天日，無知無識的，得以敎育；我們要知道我們佔全國民半數的女同胞的協力工作的力量，是如何地重大？如何的需要？願大家努力！</p>
<h3>「輕一點吧！先生。」</h3>
<p>— 章志淸</p>
<p>爲了飢餓，爲了要使我們藐小得像蟻螻的生命冉延遲片刻，我們蜂擁在平糶米店的門前了。飢餓之火煽動得使我們擁擠，掙扎，嚴整的秩序因此被擾亂了；先生！你們是治安的維持者，擾亂，騷動，的確是需要你們的皮鞭來更正的。可是，先生呵！幾天的飢餓巳足够使我們疲乏了呢。削瘦的肌肉，枯柴般的骨骼，如何再受得了在抽呢？先生呵！請接受我們的斗胆的請求：「輕一點吧；先生！在你們揮動皮鞭的時候。」　（不受酬）</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小靑著</p>
<p>第九章　驚人消息</p>
<p>我本想乘這機會搜索一下，萬一老毛有盜竊手飾的可能，那贓物勢必還來不及出門，說不定還在這箱子裏。我蹲着身子，在那柳條箱的蓋上揭了一揭。那箱子是鎖着的。我轉念一想，要開這箱子，固然不難，不過我如果馬上破壊他的箱子，未免太無根據。不如跟霍桑商量一下，再動手不遲。因此，我就站直了從門房中走出來。</p>
<p>我走上那條水泥小徑時，見陽光正滿照着靠左手的花圃上。花圃的泥地上，經過夜來雨水的冲洗，呈現着一種平順勻整狀態，還是淸晨所見的那樣子。幾朶淺紅而瘦小的月季，受着陽光的煦拂，比早晨瞧見時更有些精神，彷彿一個多愁多病的美人，得到了某種慰藉，扎掙出一種勉强的苦笑，可是它的生命的終點也就在眼前了。我走上正屋的階級，見鬥口裹面鋪蓋脚印的木板雖已移去，雜亂的脚印也增加了不少，但先前那個甲印却還不甘完全模糊，顯見這地板還沒有人抹過。我走到會客室門口，把門鈕旋了一旋，門已下鎖。我祇得站住了等待。不一回，老毛已領了金梅下樓，金梅向我站了點頭，就用手裏拿着的鑰匙開會客室的門。</p>
<p>我向老毛說：「我要跟金梅談幾句話。你到門房裏去。」</p>
<p>我先走進了會客室，等金梅跟進來以後，我順手把會客室的門關上。室中的景像和淸晨進來時並沒有兩樣，祇少了一個死人。光綫雖不很暗，但因着窗門的關閉，空氣却很沈悶，心理上還有一種悲凄的感覺，所以當我在那圓桌旁邊的皮墊椅上坐下來時，精神上很不舒適。金梅也蹙緊了雙眉，神氣上也不及初見時那麽鎭靜。</p>
<p>我說道：「金梅，你也坐下來。這件案子我們從各方面調查的結果，覺得非常曲折。我們已知道造成這曲折原因的人，就是你。」</p>
<p>那女僕向我瞧了一瞧，驚訝地說：「我？——我？什麽？我不懂。」</p>
<p>我答道：「換一句說，你早晨和我們談的話，完全沒有誠意，把重耍的事實隱藏了起來，才使這件事弄得越發複雜了。」　（四三）</p>
<h3>旋風中的上帝（一）</h3>
<p>上帝與人說話的方法和情形，隨時不同。今天的題目是叫我們想到從前上帝在旋風中和人說話的事。（約伯記三十八，）風所以稱之為旋，乃是因為這風來的時候，是一種螺旋式的，非但是猛烈的吹來，而且是在空中旋轉，小則使灰塵蔽天，大則竟有拔樹撼山之力。自然界的歷史中，常有旋風為害的記載。旋風所過之處，工切建築物和田中農作品，以及高樓大厦，却可連根拔起，毀滅無餘。</p>
<p>所謂上帝在旋風中與約伯說話，乃是一個比方，使我們推測約伯所有的旋風的經騐。他的確有這種經騐，他有七個兒子，三個女兒，七千隻羊，三千駱駝，五百對牛，五百匹驢子，並許多男女僕婢，是東方一個極富有的人。豈知在一日之間，他的兒女們正在宴會的時候，忽有狂風從曠野　來，將他的房屋吹倒，兒女們都被壓死，所有牛羊駱駝，有的被搶，有的遭瘟，自己又是渾身生瘡，坐臥不寧，痛苦萬分，這豈不是飛來橫禍，如同旋風嗎？（約伯記第一二章）</p>
<p>約伯記又告訴我們，約伯遇到這種橫禍的原因，乃是因為他是一個完全正直，敬畏上帝，遠離惡事的人。（約伯記一，）魔鬼在上帝面前控告他，說他敬畏上帝，完成是虛偽的。因為他的目的，是要得着上帝賞賜他一切子女和財產，假使將他一切所有的毀去，他必定要變心，不像從前的敬畏了。上帝為了要敎訓世人，並且要証明約伯的眞實，便准魔鬼進行試煉的工作，弄得他人畜死亡，家產毀盡，。約伯雖然遭此大難，仍不改變對於上帝的敬畏，反而說：『我赤身出母胎，也必赤身回去，賞賜的是上帝，收取的也是上帝』（伯一21）（二十七日再登）</p>

<h3>「孔夫子」先賭記</h3>
<p>— 四華</p>
<p>轟動已久的民華鉅片「孔夫子」，已在滬光試片，筆者很幸運地得到欣賞機會，爰將觀感所及，作一報道。</p>
<p>孔老夫子一生的偉業成就，如哲學思想，政治理論，敎育方法等，本片以「行仁義，正人心，」爲主題範圍，選取史實，全片書面以齊攻魯開始，士兵殘暴行爲的描寫，正刻劃了當時的黑暗。孔夫子登塲後，把當時環境叙述一過，卽問弟子顏回子路等的志向如何，引出他的「行仁義，正人心」的言論。其後戰亂與孔夫子敎弟十的塲面對照，予人印象深刻。</p>
<p>仕於魯，由對弟子講授的畫面轉接到在朝廷說魯君，但言語繼續不斷；孔子治魯的政績却由齊國方面說出，下面馬上接夾谷之會，一貫下來，毫無滯澀之感。</p>
<p>魯君納女樂後，孔子決心去魯，弟子願隨，女兒惜別，都很動人，周遊列國用長途跋涉的許多鏡頭，及各地的地圖表示，其問如在衛，陳蔡受困等都有好幾個畫面，描寫艱難困厄的情形。且兩次插入孔女祈父平安的鏡頭，更動人以孝親之情。但孔子把生死置諸度外，對這些一概處之泰然，竟使剛强憤慨的子路也感化過來，隨着孔子的琴聲歌舞起來了。孔子以高年奔走在外，並非孳孳爲利，相反地是要救庶民於水火，這種舍己爲人的犧牲精神，是每個人應該學習的。</p>
<p>該片將近結束時，描寫孔子的晚景，很使人唏噓的：救世目的旣未達到，得意門生顏回子路先後死亡，膝下僅孫一人。子路戰死一塲，處理甚好，惟大隊兵士攻擊子路，未能十分逼眞，孔子死後以一首讚美孔子的歌結束。</p>
<p>全片的布局色彩均莊重，對白精警，導演手腕精湛，鏡頭活潑，畫面美麗，惜有幾處攝影不甚淸晰，佈景很使人滿意。但大塲面的音響效果稍遜。演員方面，唐槐秋的孔子，發音很能表現孔子崇高偉大的人格。張翼的子路，英武剛强，頗能發展個性。慕容婉兒這次初上銀幕，飾南子，戲不多，未能盡展其演藝。</p>

<h3>Chinese Troops on Anhui Border Repeatedly Score Victories; Langxi and Qianshan Both Reported Recovered; Chinese Troops in Northern Jiangxi Advance to Ganzhou Market after Capturing Fengxin; Japanese Suffer Heavy Losses and are Retreating towards Anyi</h3>
<p>Tunxi:  Chinese troops on the Anhui-Jiangsu border launched a counter-offensive towards Langxi. On the 19th, they pressed close to the outskirts of the city. At midnight, they charged into the city and engaged in fierce street fighting throughout the night. The Japanese were unable to withstand the assault and collapsed. The county town of Langxi was thus reported to be recovered. (Dispatch of the 21st)</p>
<p>Lihuang:  On the morning of the 18th, several dozen Japanese troops, a mix of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, arrived at the outskirts of Qianshan city and engaged in fierce fighting with the defending Chinese troops. Around 10 o'clock, the Japanese briefly broke into the city. On the morning of the 19th at 2 o'clock, the Chinese troops began to encircle and attack the Japanese. One unit of brave soldiers broke into the city and engaged in street fighting, while another unit attacked the Japanese from outside the city. The fighting continued until around 10 o'clock, when the Japanese, unable to withstand the pressure, fled southeast. Qianshan was thus completely recovered by the Chinese troops. (Dispatch of the 20th)</p>
<p>Gao'an:  The Chinese troops who recovered Fengxin continued their eastward pursuit on the 19th and 20th to expand their victory. On the 20th, the Chinese troops had advanced to the vicinity of Ganzhou Market. The Japanese are collapsing towards Anyi. The situation before Fengxin has returned to the state it was in thirteen days ago. (Dispatch of the 21st)</p>
<p>Gao'an:  Since the Chinese troops launched a counter-offensive against Nanchang last month and inflicted heavy losses on the Japanese army in Northern Jiangxi, the Japanese have been attempting to take retaliatory action against China since February. Starting from the 13th, they gathered 3,000 troops from various parts of Northern Jiangxi and launched a fierce attack on Fengxin and the northwest region from Anyi. After being met with a head-on and painful blow by the Chinese, they suffered heavy losses. One unit fled into Fengxin city. The Chinese troops immediately eliminated the remaining Japanese west of Fengxin and, at the same time, joined forces from all directions to launch a large-scale siege against the remaining Japanese in Fengxin city. After three days and nights of intense fighting, they attacked and entered Fengxin city on the morning of the 18th. The fierce fighting continued until 3 p.m., when the Japanese collapsed and retreated towards Anyi. In total, it is estimated that over 2,000 Japanese were killed in this operation. Numerous machine guns, rifles, horses, ammunition, and other spoils of war were captured. It is noted that Fengxin was originally a major stronghold on the outer perimeter west of Japanese-occupied Nanchang. Since it was recovered by the Chinese, the Japanese forces in Nanchang and Anyi have felt threatened. This time, they concentrated all their efforts to try to regain the stronghold of Fengxin in order to complete their pincer formation. This attempt has now been shattered by the Chinese. (Dispatch of the 20th)</p>
<p>Wengyuan:  A unit of Japanese troops from Dongguan encountered a Chinese unit near Partridge Pit on the morning of the 17th. Fierce fighting immediately broke out. The Japanese retreated towards Futakeoka. (Dispatch of the 21st)</p>

The Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies also scheduled a banquet for Wu on the 22nd (Tuesday) to welcome him.

China, in its arduous struggle, has given rise to a new modern nation. The resources of the vast hinterland have been gradually developed, and a very solid economic foundation has been established in the southwest and northwest. When the war ends and the international order is restored, China's prospects for foreign trade will have unimaginable progress. Therefore, China and the Dutch East Indies should fully cooperate at present to lay the foundation for the prosperity of East Asia. (Dispatch of the 21st)</p>

According to the documents, the Japanese planes' air raid on the Yunnan-Burma Road on Sunday morning included several bridges in Yunnan province with military value. At the same time, bombs were dropped on the Chinese ammunition factory in Gejiu, southwest of Yunnan. (Associated Press dispatch of the 21st)</p>

<h3>Chongqing Prepares to Commemorate Air Defense Day</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The National Government previously designated November 21st as Air Defense Day. The Aviation Commission believes that the event is a new initiative and of great significance, and that grand commemoration ceremonies should be held on this day in various places. Chongqing, as the central location, should hold the event enthusiastically. It has now been decided to invite central and local agencies and organizations to form a preparatory committee to manage the event. (Dispatch of the 11th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Southern Advance Policy Likely to Slow Down</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Well-informed sources here are convinced that Japan's southward expansion policy will proceed slowly. It is said that this is not the first time Japan has succumbed to strong foreign pressure. Japan originally planned to obtain gains without fighting, but once Britain and the United States exposed its bluff, it would back down, because it is actually unable to risk a major war with Britain and the United States. As for the Soviet Union immediately concluding a non-aggression pact with Japan, that is highly doubtful. Although the Soviet Union wants to see the major powers fight each other, it must be certain that the outcome of this action will promote war between the United States and Japan before it will do so. Since there are few signs of war between the United States and Japan, the Soviet Union may not sign such a treaty with Japan. The negotiations for the Soviet-German pact, although they lasted for several months, were only signed on the eve of Germany's invasion of Poland, which is one example. It is expected that there will be no developments in the Far East for the time being, pending the outcome of the European war. (Reuter's dispatch)</p>

<h3>Cooperative Enterprises in Guizhou Province Progressing Rapidly</h3>
<p>Guiyang: The development of rural loans and cooperative enterprises in Guizhou is progressing very rapidly. As of now, the total amount of agricultural loans in the province has reached more than 1,500 units, with more than 335,000 members. (Dispatch of the 21st)</p>
<h3>Zhang Gongquan Arrives in Lanzhou to Inspect Transportation</h3>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Question of Whether the U.S. and Japan Will Go to War</h3>
<p>From the perspective of world war, among the international powers at present, those that are truly close to the vortex of war and can be considered problematic are Turkey and Greece, the United States, and the Soviet Union. There is no doubt that these countries, in their intentions, policies, and the direction of their efforts, are completely the same as China and Britain before the outbreak of the war, all hoping to avoid war. But will they ultimately be different from China and Britain and avoid war? Or will they inevitably follow in the footsteps of China and Britain, forced to engage in war? No one can predict. The attitude of the Soviet Union is certainly one of the important keys, and the most far-reaching and influential is the United States. The United States is preparing with the greatest determination and the highest courage to cope with a two-ocean war. In the current situation, the focus is not on the Atlantic but on the Pacific; in other words, the urgent matter is not against Germany and Italy but against Japan. In the blink of an eye before and after the announcement of the Tripartite Pact of Germany, Italy, and Japan, the Japanese government and public were calling for a showdown with the United States. However, after the United States' reaction to the Pact showed its strength and vigor, Japan suddenly restrained its attitude. Superficial observers of international affairs, therefore, hastily believed that Japan had softened and was about to temporarily remain dormant. In fact, this is just one of Japan's many acts of posing and is not enough to be seen as evidence of softening or changing. The Japanese government and public have never expressed that they can respect the international order or respect the interests of other countries, and they have never accepted the United States' proposal to maintain the status quo. Even if their posture appears soft, it is only a posture. In principle, as long as Japan does not correct its attitude, that is, as long as it does not soften its actual actions, the factors that drive US-Japan relations from confrontation and sharpness to war will remain unmitigated.</p>
<p>So, in the face of the United States' strength and vigor, does Japan ultimately have the courage to act tough, that is, will it ultimately soften or not? Yesterday's newspaper carried a dispatch from San Francisco. When the newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to Chile, Ishii Michitaka, passed through San Francisco, he claimed that "a war between the United States and Japan is impossible, because the purpose of Japan's participation in the Axis alliance is to avoid conflict between the United States and Japan." He also said that "there are still many ways for US-Japan cooperation, and there is ample time to find ways to improve all the current difficulties." Ishii also stated that this talk was published on the instructions of Foreign Minister Matsuoka, to show that what he said was not just diplomatic rhetoric from a diplomat, but the view of the Japanese diplomatic authorities. Precisely because it was published on the instructions of Foreign Minister Matsuoka, and it coincided with a time when the attitude of the United States was becoming increasingly firm and active and US-Japan relations were becoming increasingly tense, we should take a closer look. What we learn is that it is not difficult to find that there may be several different interpretations of his words. Japan fears that the United States will adhere to its policies, continue its aid to China and Britain, and that the United States will actually engage in war with Germany, Italy, or Japan due to conflicting interests. Therefore, Japan has concluded a pact with Germany and Italy, attempting to stop the United States' advancement and block its aid. Japan is hoping that this attempt will be successful, and that the cause and effect of concluding an alliance with Germany and Italy is to avoid a US-Japan war. From this perspective, Ishii's talk published on orders is not without its sincerity. The world can see the Japanese heart through Ishii's talk. This is one interpretation. In fact, after Japan formed an alliance with Germany and Italy, the United States responded with several powerful new actions. From the President, Secretary of State, and Secretaries of the Army and Navy to newspaper commentary and public opinion, the United States has also exposed Japan's attempt to form an alliance and expressed anger. Thus, it is no different from the Japanese government and public being told directly. It does not allow the Tokyo Foreign Minister and his foreign envoys to pretend to be deaf and dumb and say that the alliance is a good intention to avoid war with the United States. However, Matsuoka still ordered Ishii to say such things, probably because he knew what to fear, so he had to suddenly change his plan, engage in disguising his original attempt, and try to appease the Americans. Japan has automatically started to ease American feelings and US-Japan relations. It is foreseeable that this is the prelude to softening its actual actions and an indication of a request for a US diplomatic turnaround. This is another interpretation. According to the former interpretation, although Japan's actions are enough to provoke a US-Japan war, its original intention is only wishful thinking and empty threats, and it does not want to fight the United States. According to the latter interpretation, Japan is aware of the disadvantages of fighting the United States and fears war, so it has changed its attitude and policies.</p>
<p>Who can trust or be satisfied with this type of explanation?</p>
<p>In Ishii's talk published on orders, perhaps only one sentence can be regarded as the true intention, namely, the so-called ample time. The greater motivation for the talk is to attempt to prolong the time until the final decision on US-Japan relations. After the announcement of the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan, the United States' military deployment, diplomatic activities, and economic adjustments have truly been high-profile and swift. Britain, on the other hand, can cooperate wholeheartedly and keep pace. Following this dynamic direction, the speed of progress clearly indicates that in the near future, it has the possibility of launching any large-scale new action. This is something that Japan is struggling to cope with and cannot accept. The Japanese authorities may be blinded by greed, like to exaggerate, or be deceived by years of propaganda to the people. The situation is like riding a tiger, so even though the resistance from the United States is in front of them, they do not know regret, and they are unable to return. Therefore, they still want to use diplomatic rhetoric, lay a soft smokescreen, and try to anesthetize, hoping to gain ample time through time maneuvering. What is the advantage of time, and what is it waiting for? First, they still hope that the United States will continue its empty words and deeds, so that Japan can carry out its military conquest against China and complete its aggression. Second, they still hope that all of the United States' actions will stagnate at the current stage, so that Germany and Italy can defeat Britain first. The essence of the two is nothing more than hoping that time can save them, allowing Germany and Italy and Japan to implement their strategy of defeating the entire international community one by one; hoping that the Americans will be tolerant, that the United States will be indifferent, and that they will accept Japan's soft-spoken and gentle sophistry, and in fact grant them time. Truly, if Japan gains a decisive victory in its use of force in China, and after Britain is defeated by Germany and Italy and the empire collapses, the United States will inevitably be unable to help China and Britain and the entire changing situation, and will only cry out in despair. At that time, Matsuoka does not have to order Ishii to retract this talk, and he will naturally be able to restore his hideous original appearance. Why should he fear challenging the United States, and why should he seek to avoid war! In short, if Japan does not realize the truth, US-Japan relations will never be restored. If the United States does not take effective measures to stop it now, Japan will not realize the truth, which means that only a matter of time remains before US-Japan war. Today's Japan only hopes that the United States will give it the opportunity to choose the most favorable time for Japan to fight the United States.</p>
<h3>Thai Prime Minister Threatens Vietnam: Will Launch Blitzkrieg if Territorial Demands are Rejected</h3>
<p>Bangkok: Thai Prime Minister Songgram yesterday called on the public to remain calm during the current crisis in French Indochina, but the Prime Minister also issued a threatening statement, saying that if the French do not accept Thailand's territorial demands, Thailand will launch a blitzkrieg against Vietnam. The Prime Minister at the time advised the people to remain calm and await the government's decision. He also stated that the French delegation that is about to arrive here must have the authority to resolve Thailand's territorial claims, otherwise the delegation will not be accepted by the Thai government. According to previous reports, the delegation only has the authority to discuss the issue of the Mekong River border. The Prime Minister declared yesterday, "Even if we can obtain a reasonable settlement on the Mekong River, it still cannot show that the unfair treatment that the French gave us in the past has been completely resolved. We have decided to retake the lost territories, and we will definitely achieve our goal. We are currently trying to resolve the issue without resorting to force, but once we have to resort to force, we will try to conduct the war with the least amount of bloodshed." Several thousand Thai farmers held a demonstration march at the Ministry of Defense yesterday to express their support for the use of force against Vietnam. The farmers were carrying rice, bananas, coconuts, and other agricultural products, indicating that they would supply these items to the people during the war.

<h3>Togo Departs Soviet Union; Tatekawa May Arrive Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Moscow: The former Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Togo, departed here for Tokyo yesterday. Many members of the diplomatic corps and representatives of the Soviet Foreign Affairs Committee were at the station to see him off. Togo was appointed as Ambassador to the Soviet Union in 1938 and will be replaced by Tatekawa. The new ambassador is expected to arrive here on the 23rd. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 21st)</p>
<p>Tokyo: A Foreign Ministry spokesman said that future relations between Japan and the Soviet Union will depend on all developments after the new Japanese Ambassador to Moscow, General Tatekawa, arrives. The spokesman denied that Japan has made a major change in its policy towards the Soviet Union, saying that our will has not changed in any way. He also said that there will still be many ceremonial exchanges before the new ambassador can hold formal talks with the Soviet Union. He also mentioned the matter of transporting goods into China through Hong Kong, saying that the Japanese government has learned that the road is still blocked, and the Japanese authorities have notified the Hong Kong government to pay attention to the fact that the closure of the Hong Kong route has not been set to a time limit. Finally, he said that he had just returned from giving speeches throughout the country, and that the Tripartite Pact was warmly welcomed everywhere he went. (Reuter's dispatch of the 21st)</p>

Although a small number of opium seedlings were found in the Mongolian Banner area, they were immediately ordered to be cut down after investigation and verification, and they have indeed been cleared. As for the prohibition of transportation and sales, it has also been strictly enforced, and the results are very good. (Dispatch of the 20th)</p>

<h3>Balkan Region Threatened by War: Britain Intensifies Diplomatic Activities</h3>
<p>British Envoys in Turkey and Bulgaria in Close Contact; Soviet Union Denies Secret Negotiations with Turkey</p>
<p>London: Romania is now effectively under the iron heel of the German army. The focus of the situation at the end of this week has shifted southwards to Turkey, Bulgaria, and Greece. The British Minister to Bulgaria, Rendel, has now traveled to the Turkish capital to discuss everything with the British Ambassador to Turkey, Knatchbull-Hugessen. Before leaving Sofia, Rendel had a lengthy audience with the Bulgarian King, allowing him to inform Knatchbull-Hugessen of the King's attitude toward the new developments in the Balkans. Considering the fierce attacks on the Bulgarian King in the German newspapers, King Boris's attitude can be inferred. At the same time, Knatchbull-Hugessen has also met with the Turkish Foreign Minister, Saraçoğlu, and can inform Rendel of Turkey's reaction to the continued Axis advance in the Balkans. Undoubtedly, Turkey's reaction will depend on the Soviet Union's attitude. The Soviet Union remains silent, but Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov held talks with the Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union in the middle of last week. The Soviet Ambassador to Turkey also met with Turkish President İnönü, which is of great significance. Turkey remains calm and watches the development of the situation carefully, while preparing everything to protect its vital interests. The Axis powers are currently spreading smoke screens in the Balkans, disseminating rumors that the Axis powers have presented an ultimatum to Greece and that Greek Prime Minister Metaxas has resigned. The Axis powers undoubtedly hope that Greece will follow Romania's example and submit, but Greece, having seen Romania's fate, may not be willing to fall into the trap, especially since Greece has Britain's naval guarantee. The reports of German troops entering Bulgaria have not been confirmed, but there are many reports of German tourists entering Bulgaria. Germany is now trying to lure Bulgaria with an outlet to the Aegean Sea that is unfavorable to Greece, as a reward for Bulgaria imitating Romania. However, is it not a losing proposition to sacrifice sovereignty for this price? (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>London: The London Daily Express reported this morning that Greece has rejected Italy's demand to sever Anglo-Greek commercial relations for the third time. The Greek government has not issued any statement regarding the rejection of Italy's demands, in order to avoid a public diplomatic dispute with Italy. The Daily Express also stated that Greece is currently rushing to prepare defenses against a possible Axis attack. (International Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>Istanbul: Well-informed sources here have learned that British diplomats held negotiations in Istanbul, attended by the air and naval attachés of the British embassies in Romania and Turkey. Political circles here believe that political and military issues were discussed. During the negotiations, the Greek Ambassador to Turkey maintained constant contact with the British Embassy. It is also learned that the issue of evacuating British nationals from the Balkans was also discussed. According to sources close to the British Embassy, the British Embassy seems quite disappointed with Turkey's reserved attitude. Judging from the current situation in the Balkans and the attitude expressed in the Turkish newspapers, Britain clearly hopes that Turkey will take a stronger stance. Diplomatic circles here speculate that Turkey's reserved attitude is due to the Soviet Union's lack of a clear position, which is causing great confusion for the Turkish government. Sources here suggest that due to British initiative, a conference of diplomats from Britain, Turkey, and Greece may soon be convened in Ankara to discuss political and military issues related to the three countries. (Haitong Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>Sofia: The conference of British diplomatic representatives in the Balkan countries in Istanbul and the visit of British War Minister Eden to Cairo have attracted great attention in Bulgaria. Although the British Ambassador to Turkey, Knatchbull-Hugessen, has clearly stated that he only met with the British Minister to Bulgaria, Rendel, in Istanbul, the recent extraordinary activities of British diplomats in the Balkans have aroused suspicion among the Bulgarian people. The Newnik newspaper reported that Eden's trip to Cairo and Knatchbull-Hugessen's talks in Istanbul must be directly related, being Britain's last effort to draw Turkey and Greece into the Allied forces. The Slovo newspaper stated that Britain's attempts in this regard are doomed to failure, and that the Balkan countries wish to maintain neutrality under all circumstances and will use all means to oppose Britain's conspiracy.

As for Egypt, we solemnly declare that our enemy is not Egypt but Britain, and Britain has recently occupied Egyptian territory. The offensive of Italian East African Commander Graziani will undoubtedly not be obstructed. Greece and Turkey have gradually been drawn into the dangerous situation of British policy."

<h3>Soviet Union Revises Labor Law</h3>
<p>Moscow: The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union issued an order today, revising the current labor law. The main provision is that industrial leaders throughout the country can transfer technicians and workers from one factory to another for production needs, regardless of the distance, but workers with low wages and no special skills can still choose their place of service. Therefore, if technicians and workers in various factories disobey orders and refuse to transfer to designated factories, they will be punished for desertion under the law promulgated on July 26, 1940. However, technicians and workers who are ordered to relocate can be subsidized for travel expenses by the government, whether they bring their families or not. Observers believe that the Soviet authorities have taken this measure because they have realized that allowing workers to freely choose their place of work has been harmful to the development of national industry.

<p>Sexual Health</p>
<h3>Husband Suffers from Kidney Deficiency; Disharmonious Atmosphere in the Bedroom Deteriorates</h3>
<p>— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Healthy Sexual Function Can Harmonize a Couple's Personalities; Otherwise, Both Parties Suffer</p>
<p>Sexual desire holds great and profound potential in people's daily lives. It can dominate the environment, transform a dull and lonely life into a joyful and happy realm, harmonize the personalities of a couple, help each other, and jointly maintain family peace. Furthermore, what aspect of evolution, reproduction of mankind, etc., can lack sexual desire?</p>
<p>Although sexual function is a human instinct, it can be said that healthy people do not lack this sexual function. If this sexual function has any pathology, it is undoubtedly kidney deficiency. Once a husband suffers from kidney deficiency, both the husband himself and his wife will feel a very significant blow. Because the defects of sexual function often turn loving couples into hatred, and in severe cases, the only way out is divorce.</p>
<p>The disease of kidney deficiency affects countless men and women. It has indeed become a very serious problem. There are many types of obstacles, such as impotence, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, infertility, etc., which all cause patients to be very depressed.</p>
<p>Speaking of the treatment of kidney deficiency, as long as the prosperity of the youth glands that govern sexual desire can be increased and the function of metabolism can be promoted, health can be restored. Therefore, the only targeted treatment is to take the German genuine youth gland hormone preparation for men, "Boticam." It can cure the disease because our testicles are a kind of endocrine fluid. The function of endocrine is to excrete its secretion into the blood, transport it throughout the body, regulate the rise and fall of the whole body, and maintain the prosperity of the body. For kidney deficiency, premature ejaculation, impotence, infertility, and other symptoms caused by excessive sex and self-inflicted wounds, "Boticam," an endocrine preparation for the testicles (i.e., youth glands), can be taken to replenish the kidneys, brain, and blood, with miraculous effects. Its use in women to regulate menstruation and seed is trusted by doctors.</p>
<h3>Example of the Latest Spermatorrhea Therapy</h3>
<p>— Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Although there are many types of spermatorrhea therapy, the one that our doctors have found most effective is the use of oral medications. However, there are too many types of spermatorrhea medicine on the market, and their ingredients are also different. The best one is the German "Niles Spermatorrhea Pills." Now, let's cite an example to prove its effectiveness.</p>
<p>Patient Xia, 19 years old, started masturbating at the age of 16 and then felt spermatorrhea, involuntary emission, incomplete development, headaches, insomnia, and other symptoms. Although he took over-the-counter medicines on the market, they were all ineffective. Then, the doctor prescribed "Niles Spermatorrhea Pills," three pills to be taken only once a day (before bed), and also German testicular endocrine preparations to make up for the loss, three times a day. After a month, not only did the spermatorrhea stop permanently, but also development was promoted, and the brainpower was refreshed. This proves that these two medicines are the most targeted treatment for spermatorrhea.</p>

<h3>How to Completely Eradicate Rapidly Spreading Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Dr. Wang Kechun, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>The human body is an integrated whole; one hair can move the entire body. Therefore, when one part is invaded by bacteria, the entire body feels pain. Generally, people believe that gonorrhea is a localized problem, and treatments only focus on localized sterilization, neglecting the overall issue. This has resulted in many inferior drugs with only adverse reactions and no sterilizing power. Most of the inferior drugs on the market only focus on membrane penetration for sterilization, and this type of sterilization is only temporary and superficial. There is absolutely no real, fundamental effect. For many years, after consulting the latest European and American medical materials for treating gonorrhea, I must recommend the latest chemical therapy "Klinon" announced by Dr. Peter of Germany. This agent is based on the principle of chemical therapy with the unit of eradicating gonorrhea. This agent aims to purely eliminate gonorrhea bacteria, which is incomparable to other chemical therapies for treating gonorrhea in conjunction. Therefore, "Klinon" has extremely strong sterilizing power and absolutely no chemical therapy reactions. Therefore, "Klinon" is highly effective for all acute and chronic gonorrhea, such as gonorrheal anterior and posterior urethritis, orchitis, prostatitis, arthritis, cystitis, etc. Its success rate is above 98%. For rapidly spreading gonorrhea and highly dangerous gonorrheal toxins, taking "Klinon" (available in major pharmacies) is exceptionally effective.</p>

<h3>The Harm of Pulmonary Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Tuberculosis is the most virulent disease that robs human lives and is a great enemy to human prosperity. Therefore, people with lung disease should seek treatment early. Once the lungs lose their health, tuberculosis will worsen daily, leading to mental fatigue, night sweats, and decreased appetite. Subsequently, chest pain and coughing will occur, accompanied by a sallow complexion and emaciation, coughing up phlegm and blood, tinnitus, headaches, insomnia, palpitations, shortness of breath, and difficulty sleeping. If only symptomatic treatments are used, although they can suppress superficial symptoms, the tuberculosis bacteria will still exist, making reproduction easier and causing more complications. However, the drug "Bu Fei Naer" (Lung Supplement Naer) has truly different effects because it can eradicate tuberculosis bacteria, shrink lesions, and restore eroded lung cavities to their original state. This is the most ideal oral medication for lung disease. As for coughing, taking this medication can relieve coughing and eliminate phlegm within three hours, with guaranteed effectiveness.</p>
<h3>Gonorrhea Lecture</h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Unbearable to Recall Consolation When Happiness Was!</p>
<p>Many cases of gonorrhea are easily curable, but they often become difficult-to-cure chronic leukorrhea due to missed opportunities. It is truly "exchanging a moment of pleasure for a lifetime of regret." Recalling the times of bright lights and green wine, it is truly unbearable to recall. In fact, there is always the possibility of contracting venereal diseases when engaging in such activities. As long as treatment is effective, there is no reason why it cannot be cured. Because science is now advanced, unlike in the 19th century, once infected, one would be trapped by this disease and unable to escape. In fact, science is now greatly advanced, and there is absolute certainty of curing such acute and chronic gonorrhea. Taking modern oral medications, there is the special gonorrhea drug "Klinon" (available in major pharmacies), which can produce anti-gonorrheal phagocytic action and a powerful analgesic effect, so the radical cure of gonorrhea can be quickly realized. With over 20 years of clinical experience, I also find that "Klinon" is superior to the inferior drugs that have been on the market in the past and present. I also use German induced electrostatic therapy, ice compress therapy, etc., which makes spring healing even easier. Treating syphilis, lymphogranuloma venereum, chancroid, and sexual neurasthenia. Twenty patients are admitted daily, with a registration fee of only five jiao per patient.</p>

<h3>French Coastal Ports Fiercely Bombed by British Air Force; British and German Cannons Exchange Fire Across the Strait; German Aircraft Groups Fly High to Invade Britain</h3>
<p>Dover, last night until this morning, large squadrons of British air force, resembling swarms of bees, crossed the English Channel, carrying out the most intense attacks on German forces in the various ports of French territory. The Hitler invasion base was given a very large destruction, countless tons of bombs, like a torrential rain, with a bombing amount reaching more than one hundred pieces per minute. The terrible destruction almost spread to the French coastal area. Before the British Air Force implemented the fierce bombing, the exchange of fire between the British and German cannons across the sea had shown an unprecedented tension. The attack by the British Air Force began at seven o'clock in the afternoon. At that time, the sound of bomb explosions was like thunder, and both sides of the coast shook. All the glass windows in the coastal areas of Kent trembled and made urgent noises, and many furnishings in the houses were also knocked down and destroyed by the shock. On Sunday afternoon, German long-range cannons fired fifty shots at the residential area of Dover. Several good houses, a hotel, and a church in the area were hit, killing one person and seriously injuring two. At sunset, the German long-range cannons fired two more rounds of shots. Afterwards, the British Air Force showed its power on the French coast, without rest until noon. Every ten or twelve minutes, a new squadron of British aircraft replaced the old ones. In the five hours from dusk to midnight, the German positions on the French coast suffered countless bombs, perhaps thousands. After each terrifying British aircraft bombing, there was a ten-minute break. Ten minutes later, another team of British aircraft arrived, and all the British aircraft seemed to be emptying their baskets, throwing all the bombs they carried at the German base. Although the Strait was shrouded in thick fog, making it difficult to clearly see the explosion of British aircraft bombs on the other side, the sky last night was bright and moonlit, which greatly aided the British aircraft's air raid. Last night, thousands of residents gathered on the beach, looking up and admiring the attack of the British Air Force. They said that such weather was a good opportunity for German aircraft to attack Britain. However, the British Air Force had already taken the lead. Yesterday, a Messerschmitt aircraft was shot down over this area, and the German pilot was slightly injured. He parachuted into the field and was captured by farmers. Yesterday morning, British long-range cannons fired more than twenty shots at the German fleet attempting to depart from Calais to Poland. British air reconnaissance aircraft also indicated the location of the fleet from the air to facilitate the attack by the artillery. Due to heavy fog and frost, the effect of the artillery attack could not be seen. The loud sound of the British long-range cannons caused the entire city of Dover to shake. Before noon, the British long-range artillery team attacking the German fleet, along with another artillery team, carried out the largest artillery attack since the war in response to the German artillery fire entering the English ships in the port of Dover. The guns of the British artillery team were fired at Cape Gris-Nez. When the German army fired artillery, two or three shells fell into the water off the coast of Dover every few minutes. Although the situation in the strait could not be seen due to the fog, the Germans seemed to be blindly bombarding all British ships passing through the strait. On the same day, many German bombers and fighter jets flew to the vicinity of Dover, but were immediately driven away by British Spitfires. The Spitfire squadrons also flew across the strait and vigorously pursued the German aircraft. Yesterday, the anti-aircraft guns here fired frequently, because individual German aircraft sometimes flew to the location, seemingly wanting to bomb the British artillery positions. It was heard that at least two German bombers were shot down. One of them swayed and fell towards the sea, and then disappeared into the fog, never to be seen again. (United Press dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Berlin. A Huitong News Agency reporter has learned that German aircraft dropped more than 500 tons of bombs in various parts of Britain in the past 24 hours. Along the way, they encountered very few British fighter planes. No German aircraft were lost, and all safely returned to their original defense. (Huitong dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>London. Today's Air Ministry communique states that two enemy aircraft were destroyed last night. The enemy's nighttime air raid mainly targeted the London area and the Midlands. The London area suffered considerable damage to buildings, and several fires broke out. Several people were killed and injured. In the Midlands, only one city was most heavily bombed, with houses, schools, and shops destroyed in many places, and several people killed and injured. Although other places were also bombed by enemy aircraft, the damage and injuries were extremely slight. Yesterday, seven German aircraft were shot down, and three British aircraft were destroyed, but all the pilots escaped safely. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>London. Yesterday, after the British artillery bombarded across the Dover Strait, the German artillery retaliated fiercely for two hours, causing the glass windows in a large area of the British side to be shattered. However, as a whole, the material damage was very minor. It is estimated that only one person was killed and two were injured. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>London. In today's house raid, the headquarters of the Youth Association here was hit by a high-explosive bomb, suffering great damage. Four or five hundred members who were sheltering in the gymnasium were fortunate to escape safely. Most of the houses are no longer habitable. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>London. Reuters Air Force reporter said that the German Air Force is now gradually using semi-stratospheric altitudes in the British "white book" aircraft. This is another consequence of the German side's attempt to break through British defenses with a large number of daytime bombers under fighter protection, which ultimately failed. The German side sent fighter-bombers to carry out this offensive, with single-seat fighters also carrying bombs as assistance. However, this offensive relies entirely on rapid flight and the greatest possible use of cloud cover to launch surprise attacks. However, during this "second summer" weather in Britain, there is not enough cloud cover to rely on, so German aircraft have to seek rapid flight and high altitude. When enemy aircraft cross the coast to London, the general altitude is above 30,000 feet, more than five miles above the ground, making interception difficult. This is because the mobility of British defending fighters decreases greatly when flying over this altitude, and the handling is quite uncomfortable. German aircraft flying to altitudes above 30,000 feet are far away from the range of ground artillery fire. In addition, there are more enemy aircraft. This is why the German Air Force has suffered less loss in recent times, and sometimes the number of British aircraft lost is not greater than that of German aircraft. Recently, the German side has been using Messerschmitt 109 and 110 aircraft to harass Britain, which has greatly reduced the area of their attacks. For example, on Sunday, the activity of German aircraft was almost limited to the southeast corner, and they carried few bombs, so the damage they could inflict on Britain was also minimal. If the German side can constantly fly to various places from the south coast to London and immediately escape after attacking, then this method is quite valuable in harassment. In addition, they also repeatedly flew to Britain for night raids, so that the inner and outer defenses of London were always on alert, and the public often entered and exited air raid shelters and could not rest peacefully. Undoubtedly, this is one of the main goals of the German side. The British Air Force staff officers are now paying close attention to this matter. According to reason, the British side will not dispatch reserve fighter squadrons to make up for the difference in the number of aircraft, but will use a type of aircraft with extremely high rate of climb and high endurance in the new fighters, so that the German aircraft in night raids will be eclipsed. German aircraft coming in daylight have now added thicker armor for protection. This German safety measure has not escaped the attention of British Air Force strategists. The British side will definitely respond with weapons with greater armor-piercing power. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>London. German aircraft flew high yesterday, mostly wreaking havoc in southeastern Britain. The Air Ministry communique stated that the material damage and casualties were not significant. A total of seven German aircraft were shot down yesterday, one of which was a Messerschmitt fighter-bomber, which was shot down in a street in London. Most of the attacking enemy aircraft were fighters or fighter-bombers. In the morning and afternoon, several teams crossed the coast of Kent and flew towards London and the Thames Estuary. Some of them broke into the London area. Bombs fell in London, Kent, and Wessex. There was little activity of enemy aircraft in other parts of Britain, and no bombs were reported to have been dropped. The enemy aircraft tried to harass London five times via the Thames Estuary, but were intercepted by British fighters. After the enemy aircraft were bombed by the Thames Estuary's artillery, they fought fiercely three times with the intercepting British aircraft over the two towns. The enemy fighters tried to break through the barrage balloons over the port of Dover three times, but without success, they were driven away by ground artillery fire. In the afternoon, in addition to a yellow-nosed Messerschmitt German aircraft being shot down in a street in London and its pilot also dying, another enemy aircraft was pursued by British fighters, with smoke coming from its engine, and fled towards French territory. According to German official news agencies, Berlin claimed that German aircraft shot down nine British aircraft in an attack on Britain on Sunday. Three German aircraft did not return to their base. The German aircraft that carried out the attack hit important military facilities in London and a military camp in southwestern Britain with bombs. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>London. The British Embassy was damaged in the recent London night raid. A time bomb fell near the embassy and then exploded, shattering some doors and windows. However, all the personnel on duty at the time were safe and sound. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>British Bomber Squadrons Break Through Berlin's Air Defenses and Bomb Northern Italy Extensively; Bombs Rain Down on Berlin's Residential Areas</h3>
<p>Berlin. Early this morning, British bombers broke through Berlin's air defenses, causing the German capital to suffer an unprecedentedly severe attack. British aircraft dropped incendiary bombs and high-explosive bombs on residential areas in Berlin, as dense as rain and avalanches. Since the British aircraft bombed Berlin, this was also the strongest attack ever. Although hundreds of searchlights and anti-aircraft guns fired together, the British aircraft still swooped down and unloaded their batches of bombs. The 4 million residents of Berlin stayed in air raid shelters all night, not sleeping. Even until dawn this morning, although the German anti-aircraft fire was fierce, the British aircraft rumbled over Berlin all night without leaving. German officials said that when the British aircraft bombed, two aircraft were shot down. The Germans said that the purpose of this British air raid was to "intimidate" because "only incendiary bombs were used and only residential areas were bombed." The air raids last night and this morning caused several fires, so there must have been many deaths and injuries. (International dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>London. An Air Ministry communique announced that last night the British Air Force carried out extensive bombing from Berlin to northern Italy. Targets in the above two regions and other parts of Germany were attacked. Aggressive seaports were also bombed. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>German Military Report</h3>
<p>Berlin. This afternoon's German military report stated that a German submarine sank a British auxiliary cruiser (over 10,000 tons), and two other submarines sank two escort vessels. Last night, German aircraft sank two escort merchant ships (approximately 20,000 tons). German coastal batteries bombed two large merchant tires in Dover Harbor. Subsequently, the enemy's long-range artillery also fired several shots at the French coast. There were no losses on the French side. German light bombers bombed several cities in London and central and southern England. A fire broke out at the oil pool in Thameshaven. There were several air battles yesterday and last night, all of which were won by the German forces. At night, German heavy bombers intensified their bombing of London, and a large number of bombs fell on both banks of the Thames River. Armories in central England and seaports in the west were also severely bombed. Last night, enemy aircraft flew over German territory and dropped bombs in Berlin and other cities. Apart from the destruction of railway tracks in the west, there was no damage to military facilities. Several houses were destroyed, and several civilians were killed or injured. That was all. In total, 19 enemy aircraft were lost yesterday, and one German aircraft went missing. (Huitong dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>French Aircraft Crashes into the Sea and Sinks; Many Officers Perish</h3>
<p>Vichy. A French aircraft carrying three French military officers, four officers belonging to the German Supervisory Committee, and six German military assistants and soldiers, a total of thirteen people, crashed into the Mediterranean Sea due to a storm and quickly sank. Although French officials immediately dispatched personnel to rescue after receiving the news, it was too late. All the people on board were drowned. The remains were washed ashore and were given a funeral by the French authorities in accordance with military etiquette. The chairman of the German Supervisory Committee, in addition to expressing his thanks to the French authorities, also expressed condolences to the French military officers who died.

<h3>American Aircraft Factories Increase Working Hours to Fourteen Hours a Day</h3>
<p>London. British Ambassador to the United States, Lothian, flew to Lisbon from the United States and then flew to Britain from Lisbon. He arrived here yesterday and said to guests that American aircraft are now arriving in Britain one after another, in batches of hundreds, and the number will increase greatly next year. American armaments have made significant progress. American public opinion knows the necessity of assisting Britain. The people of London are calm and orderly despite being bombed. The United States is deeply impressed by this. The American Army authorities have asked American aircraft manufacturers to adopt a fourteen-hour work system per day. He thinks that each factory will comply. He will stay in the central government for three weeks and now needs to go to the Scottish region for a few days of rest before returning to London to report to the government.

<h3>British Air Force Intensifies Attacks on Italian Bases in Libya; Ships Hit in Port of Benghazi</h3>
<p>Cairo. British bombers increased their strength at the end of this week, striking Italian bases and ships in Libya. According to last night's communique, on Sunday, British Air Force bombers attacked a row of ships in the port of Benghazi and bombed the barracks in the port, causing a fire. The barracks, telephone exchange, and military headquarters in Benghazi were bombed on Saturday night. Italian barracks and a large number of motor transport vehicles south of Bardia were also bombed. When British aircraft attacked Newwa and Solen in Halfaya, bombs hit anti-aircraft gun teams and barracks. On the same night, British aircraft also attacked Morechai in the Dodecanese Islands. The extent of the damage is unknown. The aircraft hangar in Diradawa, Abyssinia, was hit and exploded, causing a fire. All the attacking British aircraft returned safely. Also, shortly after midnight on Saturday, the island of Bahrain in the Persian Gulf was bombed by four Italian aircraft. However, the material damage was minimal, and there were no casualties.

<h3>American Citizens Urge the Secretary of the Army to Coordinate Air Defense; Recruit Three Million Volunteers to Command Defense Plans</h3>
<p>Washington. It was revealed here today that American civil groups are now urging Secretary of the Army Stimson to organize a civil defense department to coordinate methods for underground and indoor air raid preparedness, and relief plans for the major cities of the United States after bombing. This proposal requires the recruitment of three million volunteers to command civil defense plans across the country. It is generally believed that the immediate establishment of this group can allow the US Army to somewhat relieve its responsibility for purely civilian defense plans, and can allow rural residents to safely avoid possible air raids by enemy forces. Officials here today said that the increasing concern across the United States for the civil defense system can be seen in the increase in letters they have sent to the Army Department. Officials also said that the 44th consecutive air raid on London has made the American public aware of air raids. (International News Agency dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Snow on the Coastline of the North Atlantic</h3>

<h3>Britain and the Netherlands Call on the United States to Jointly Defend the Dutch East Indies; Suggest Using Singapore to Command Naval Battles; Japanese Representative Kobayashi is Scheduled to Return Home Today</h3>
<p>Washington. According to news here today, the British and Dutch governments have called on the United States to cooperate in defending the Dutch East Indies, as a condition for prohibiting oil exports to Japan from the Dutch East Indies. Reliable sources say that Britain has suggested that the United States use the Singapore base to command the naval battles needed to defend the Dutch East Indies. It is also said that the call for US assistance and the suggestion to use the Singapore base were conveyed to US Secretary of State Hull by British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Lothian. Since Lothian returned to London last week, talks have stopped. It is generally believed that Lothian was called back to the country because the US government was unwilling to provide precise guarantees to the British requests. At the same time, US Ambassador to Britain Kennedy was also called back to Washington to discuss whether this move could reach a compromise. (International News Agency dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>London. Reliable sources said last night that Japan is putting pressure on the Dutch East Indies to force them to abolish the contract to export aviation gasoline to Britain.

<h3>US Interests in Shanghai - Still Determined to Maintain - All Important Businesses Operate as Usual - No Concessions Made on Central District Defense</h3>
<p>According to news from the US Consulate yesterday, the US official notice to American nationals in the Far East to withdraw and return home is currently limited to "non-essential personnel." The remaining personnel will not be evacuated for the time being. It is also understood that there are a total of 4,000 American nationals in Shanghai, of which approximately 1,500 are women and children, who will generally wait for ships to return home. However, the remaining employed American men will remain in Shanghai. Although American nationals are extremely concerned about the development of the situation in the Far East, their emotions are calm and there is no sign of anxiety. All important American businesses in Shanghai are operating as usual, and there are no internal changes, which proves that the common speculation about American businesses in this city based on the closure of some American commercial organizations in Tianjin and Beijing is premature. According to well-informed sources, Shanghai is one of the largest areas of American investment in the Far East, and this "economic fortress" will not be abandoned unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Central District Defense - US Highly Concerned</p>
<p>According to reliable news from foreign diplomatic circles yesterday, the US authorities in Washington also regard the issue of defense transfer in the central district of the Shanghai International Settlement as one of the important interests of the United States in the Far East. Although the US government has not yet made representations to Japan on this issue, it is paying close attention to it. Therefore, if Japan does not make concessions on the issue of defense of the Shanghai International Settlement, it will also become an important factor stimulating a strong anti-Japanese sentiment in the US government and public.</p>
<p>British and American Merchant Corps - Continue to be Stationed</p>
<p>According to news from senior officers of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, the highest authorities of the Shanghai International Settlement have decided to extend the stationing of the British and American units of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps in the central district for another month. The Shanghai International Settlement authorities originally scheduled the temporary takeover of the central district by the Corps to end on September 16, which was then extended to the end of October, and now it has been extended again to the end of November.</p>
<p>Scheduled Berths - Daily Increase</p>
<p>According to the reporter's investigation yesterday, the President Lines received more than 100 additional applications for scheduled berths from American nationals yesterday, bringing the total to over 4,000. At least 1,800 of these were issued by American nationals in Shanghai, and the rest were from American nationals in other parts of China and Japan. The US Consul General's Office has also received more than 4,000 responses from American nationals in Shanghai to the Office's notices. However, there have been no new developments regarding the progress of the evacuation of American nationals. According to senior officials of the President Lines, in addition to the four ships already announced, no other new ships have been added to the fleet ordered to come to the Far East to evacuate American nationals. As for the President Coolidge, President Pierce, and President Taft, although they are also assisting in the evacuation of American nationals back to the United States, this is not due to emergency measures, as the dates of arrival and departure of these ships from Shanghai will follow the schedule set before the State Department issued the advisory.</p>
<p>Four Ships' Fares - Almost Double</p>
<p>The minimum fares for the four giant postal vessels ordered to come to the Far East to transport American nationals back to the United States are almost double those of the President Taft and President Cleveland of the President Lines. It is understood that the minimum fares from Shanghai to San Francisco are US$395 each for the President Monde and the President Mariposa, while the minimum fare for the President Washington is US$450. At the same time, the minimum fares for the President Taft and other President Lines ships of the same size are only US$200, and even the minimum fare for the President Coolidge is only US$240. Senior officials of the American President Lines explained to reporters that the four postal vessels that are about to come to Shanghai to evacuate American nationals do not have third-class cabins, and these four postal vessels are all of the same class, so they cannot be compared with the President Lines ships.</p>
<p>Hankou American Nationals - First Trip to Shanghai</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Hankou on the 21st: The families of the American staff of Standard Oil, consisting of four women and one young child, booked tickets to Shanghai last week, but the ship was requisitioned by the Japanese army to transport troops, resulting in the temporary cancellation of the voyage. The American nationals were delayed for several days and only set out for Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Rate Hike - Only Proposed</h3>
<p>Due to the deficit in the previous fiscal year's final accounts, the Shanghai Municipal Council's budget for this year implemented an increase in municipal taxes from July of this year. However, since the implementation of the tax increase, prices have not been suppressed, and rice prices and food have soared, forcing the Council's expenditures to exceed the budget again. It is permissible for the allowances of the Council's Chinese and foreign staff to be increased. Therefore, the Council is considering increasing municipal taxes again. A reporter from the Pingming News Agency made inquiries about this matter to relevant parties close to the International Settlement authorities. It is learned that although the authorities have begun to consider the tax increase issue, it will not be implemented at present. However, the Council has to study it in advance due to the budget exceeding expenditures. The date of implementation is still far away, as the Council cannot implement the tax increase issue without authorization. It must be submitted to the ratepayers' annual meeting for approval. Therefore, although the Council is currently considering a tax increase, it will definitely not be implemented before the next ratepayers' annual meeting.</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation Opens - Hong Kong-Shaoguan Air Route</h3>

<h3>Another Batch of British Nationals - Volunteer to Enlist - Scheduled to be Compulsory from Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that there are quite a few British nationals in the city who are volunteering to enlist. Another group is scheduled to leave for Malaya, India, and Britain on Wednesday to serve the country. This is the third batch of British nationals leaving Shanghai to enlist in ten days, totaling eleven people. Three of them will join the British Air Force, and the rest will join the British Army. Another batch of British nationals in Shanghai who are enlisting will postpone their departure to the second half of November due to the irregular schedule of ships.</p>
<h3>French Authorities Express Approval of Foreign Rice Profits</h3>
<p>The Price Evaluation Committee of the French Concession Public Works Bureau convened a meeting of the Rice and Grain Sub-Committee at the General Administration Office on Avenue Joffre at 1:00 PM yesterday. All committee members attended and deliberated. In addition to reporting on the committee's affairs, the committee expressed its approval of the Shanghai Rice and Grain Price Evaluation Committee's proposed 5% profit margin for the sale of foreign rice on the market. Once the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement approves it, it can reply to the Rice and Grain Price Evaluation Committee to implement it on schedule.</p>
<h3>Resolution of the French Business Water and Electricity Company Strike - All Traffic to Resume Tomorrow - Conditions to be Signed This Afternoon</h3>
<p>The French Business Water and Electricity Company's strike continued to be negotiated yesterday afternoon and has been successfully resolved. It is scheduled that the two parties will sign the resumption of work conditions at the company at 6:00 PM today. All buses and trams will officially resume operations tomorrow. The Pingming News Agency reporter went to the company yesterday to wait for the results of the negotiations. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Negotiation Situation</p>
<p>After the labor and management sides and the Department of Political Affairs held two direct negotiations at the company on the 19th, most of the conditions have been resolved. Only the reinstatement of dismissed workers is still in dispute. Afterwards, the labor and management sides conducted indirect negotiations through mediators, and a satisfactory solution was also negotiated for this issue. It was decided to continue direct negotiations yesterday afternoon. At 5:40 PM, the labor representatives, Shi Jinfu and Zhang Fubao from the Mechanical Department, Pan Lujie, Gao Chengding, Shen Zhiqin, Li Huidin, Gu Xichun, and Gu Jinrong from the Transportation Department, all arrived at the company to negotiate with Director Fafolet and two representatives from the Department of Political Affairs in the compradore's spare room. Both sides were very sincere in their attitude. The discussions lasted for three hours, ending at 7:30 PM.</p>
<p>Resolution Focus</p>
<p>The focus of yesterday's negotiations was concentrated on two points: (1) the reinstatement of dismissed workers; (2) the increase of wages. After the negotiations began, the labor representatives explained the first issue to the management, saying that these dismissed workers were actually dismissed for participating in the strike and organizing groups. Now that both sides have clarified, these workers can be fully reinstated. The management replied that, in order to handle this strike reasonably, it will gradually allow 30 of the 46 dismissed workers to be reinstated, and the rest will be hired after the resumption of work. The labor side was satisfied. Regarding the second issue of wages, the labor side initially insisted on an increase of six yuan, and if a subsidy was increased, it would have to be eight yuan. Finally, in order to show sincerity, it also made concessions. As a result, a subsidy of six yuan was granted. As for other issues, after a short period of discussion, they were all resolved. Both sides were satisfied, so they drafted the establishment conditions, which are scheduled to be signed by both parties at 2:00 PM this afternoon. Work can officially resume tomorrow, and trams and buses can all resume operations tomorrow. All parties are pleased that the strike, which lasted for 27 days, has now been successfully resolved.</p>
<h3>Eastern Zhejiang War Gradually Stabilizes - Zhuji Telecommunications Disconnected</h3>
<p>According to reports from the Zhejiang natives in Shanghai, the war situation in Zhuji County has stabilized since the recapture of the county seat on the 19th. The Zhuji County government has returned to the city to work, but the government office buildings in the city have been burned down, and they are now being cleaned up. When Zhuji was lost, another group of Japanese troops harassed Lizhu Town in Shaoxing, and the situation in Shaoxing was tense. After the recapture of Zhuji, this group of Japanese troops, fearing that their rear would be cut off, also retreated rapidly to Xiaoshan. The Shaoxing Bank has not moved, the post office is working as usual, and the telegraph office temporarily suspended commercial telegrams due to the congestion of military telegrams, but has now resumed sending and receiving. Therefore, postal and telegraphic remittances are all smooth and unobstructed. The people of Ningbo have remained calm and have not been affected by the war in the Zhuji and Lin'an areas. However, telephone and telegraph communication between Ningbo and Zhuji have been cut off since the 16th and have not yet been restored. It was slightly damaged during the fierce fighting in the suburbs of Zhuji and has not yet been repaired. According to post office news, although mail to various towns and cities in Zhuji County, such as Zhaojiabu, Baidou, Zhibu, Caota, Paitou, Fengqiao, Tangjiadian, Machege, Yaogongbu, Zaiwang, Sandu, etc., is still being collected and sent as usual, it has obviously been impossible to deliver it due to the unfinished war in the area, and it appears to be at a standstill. However, the post office is determined to load the collected mail onto wheels and transport it to find a way to deliver it nearby. If the recipient has already moved, the original item will be returned to the sender. Therefore, it is hoped that the Zhuji natives in Shanghai will temporarily refrain from delivering mail to their hometown. It is also learned that Da Bei Da Dong Telegraph Office is still receiving and sending Zhuji telegrams as usual, but delivery is difficult.</p>
<h3>Tai Gu Ship Sails South - Shanghai Goods Shipped to Burma in Batches - Restrictions on Taking British Gold Tickets to Yangon - Passengers Landing in Burma Must Have Visas</h3>
<p>Since the reopening of the Burma Road, the Shanghai customs brokerage and foreign shipping industries have urgently sought to establish shipping between Shanghai and Yangon. However, there have been no direct scheduled ships between Shanghai and Yangon, and even irregular ships are rare due to the long distance. In the past, most of the goods shipped to Burma were first transshipped to Singapore. Taigu Steamship Company has recently shipped two batches of goods to Singapore for transshipment to Yangon. Today, a third batch is being shipped to Hong Kong for transshipment to Burma. In addition, the Glacier Line is planning to sail directly to Yangon and is being represented by Tongyi and Hongyun Shipping Companies. It is currently being planned and is scheduled to sail on Thursday of this week.</p>
<p>Visa Procedures</p>
<p>Anyone wishing to go to Yangon and enter the southwest and northwest regions via the Burma Road must complete passport procedures to avoid conflicting with local regulations and being refused landing. The Passport Visa Office of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong has issued a notice to prevent the above from happening: "Any Chinese citizen wishing to go to British territories can obtain a passport from the office and complete all procedures. The office can provide guidance on the details. Those in Shanghai who wish to go to Yangon to obtain a passport can inquire at the China Travel Service and then obtain it from the Passport Visa Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong."</p>
<p>Prohibition of Carrying British Banknotes</p>
<p>Since the British government ordered a ban on the import of British banknotes into the country, the Governor of Burma has ordered a ban on anyone from any other country except India from carrying Bank of England banknotes into Burma, except with the permission of the Reserve Bank of India. Ordinary travelers are limited to carrying £10 of Bank of England banknotes into the country. Passengers from Shanghai to Yangon, Burma, should be careful not to carry more than £10 of British banknotes to avoid being seized and confiscated by the Yangon authorities. These Bank of England banknotes are the British gold tickets in the Shanghai market.</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Officer - Visits Chairman of Shanghai Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Yesterday (21st), Vice Admiral Iwamura Seiichi, the Japanese naval attaché stationed in Shanghai, accompanied by his successor, Rear Admiral Kanazawa Masao, visited the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The Volunteer Corps dispatched honor guards to pay their respects.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Obstruct Shipping - Investigation of the Bombing of Shipu - More Than 900 Houses Destroyed - More Than 10 People Killed or Injured</h3>
<p>At 9:30 AM on the 16th of this month, three Japanese warships anchored outside Shipukou suddenly fired 18 shells at the coast. One shell landed on Shipu Jiao San Wine Shop, destroying one house. Seventeen shells landed in front of Yanchang, destroying four civilian houses. There were no other losses. At around 10:00 AM, four Japanese planes attacked from the southeast, invading the airspace over Shipu City, flying low and circling.</p>
<p>Rotating Bombing</p>
<p>They dropped two incendiary bombs and two explosive bombs at the Old Daotou, Jiangqin Temple, and Nan Guan Bridge areas outside the city. One incendiary bomb and one explosive bomb were dropped in the Dandang Lane area in the city center. One explosive bomb landed at the foot of Tiger Cave Mountain, injuring one civilian. One bomb was dropped in the Great Church Ground, but no one was injured and there was no damage. The planes indiscriminately strafed the ground with machine guns for fifteen minutes before fleeing to the northeast. At that time, black smoke gathered over Shipu,</p>
<p>Stretching Straight</p>
<p>Into the clouds, the situation was terrifying. Because the shops and residents there could not withstand the shelling, they moved to the countryside on their own, leaving only a few poor, old, weak, and infirm people. As a result, there were few people to put out the fire, and it was left to burn itself out. It was not extinguished until 4:00 PM, and a total of more than 930 houses were burned down, with losses reaching 300,000 yuan. Eleven women and children and six men were burned to death.</p>
<p>Scorched and Battered</p>
<p>Some only had half a body left, and their intestines were broken and bleeding. The scene was unbearable to witness. Five men and two women were injured, but their lives were not in danger. After Shipu was bombed this time, there was no one left in the urban area. Only thin stray dogs were wandering around among the rubble and in the streets and alleys, searching for food. The scene was extremely desolate. Also, at 9:10 AM on the 15th of this month, the Ningbo air defense watch post reported that four Japanese seaborne bombers were attempting to</p>
<p>Invade Shipu.</p>
<p>The air raid emergency alarm was sounded. Ten minutes later, two planes circled over Shipu for a long time, spying. Afterwards, they escaped towards Linhai. Two other planes circled for a week and dropped four bombs on Dongmen Island, destroying three houses and one thatched shed. After dropping the bombs, the planes escaped towards Longshan out to sea.</p>
<h3>Crimes Greatly Reduced After Strict Security Measures in French Concession - No Assassination Cases in September - Other Robberies and Thefts Similarly Reduced - A Rare Phenomenon in French Concession Police Records</h3>

<h3>Watching "West Front Film" - Impression of History and Tribulations</h3>
<p>Mr. Ke De, Information Specialist of the German Embassy in China, hosted the press at the German School on Daxilu at 3:30 PM yesterday and screened a film on the Western Front. Mr. Ke stood up and made a speech, saying that he had missed everyone very much since he last saw them. He was very happy to be reunited in one room. Today, he is screening a film showing the German army's operations in various countries on the Western Front for everyone to enjoy. As for the content, everyone will understand it after watching it, and he doesn't need to waste words. The films screened this time are also accompanied by simple Chinese explanations, and he asks for everyone's instructions to achieve perfection. After he finished speaking, the lights were turned off, and Germany's "blitzkrieg," which shocked the world, began to be shown on the screen.</p>
<p>This so-called "West Front Film" has richer materials than those previously screened by the German Embassy. Although it is also a newsreel, it has become a complete story on the whole after editing. The main material is the German army's invasion of Holland, Belgium, and France, interspersed with the Norwegian defense war, Italy's declaration of war against Britain, and naval battles in the North Sea. It can be shown for two hours from the German army's capture of the Dutch port of Rotterdam to the French army's surrender and signing of the armistice terms with the Germans in the Forest of Compiègne. The time included in the battles shown in the film was exactly one month and nine days from May 11, when the German army began to attack Rotterdam with paratroopers, to June 20, when the French and Germans signed the peace treaty.</p>
<p>The German army's invasion of Western Europe first used the Fifth Column to sway people's hearts and serve as a hidden line for internal support. Then, paratroopers were dropped from the air to break into the enemy's rear, followed by artillery bombardment, aerial bombing, and finally mechanized units to protect the infantry charge. Those who stood in their way were crushed, and the capture of cities was a matter of moments. Therefore, when it was shown on the screen, except for the activities of the Fifth Column, which were not shown, the other formulas of the "blitzkrieg" were generally the same. The first shot of the "West Front Film" was of a group of planes rising from the runway at an airfield, the sound of creaking reverberating from the screen. In an instant, paratroopers descended, their huge parachutes slowly descending from the sky. After landing, each soldier formed a small team and began to attack behind enemy lines. Then, giant cannons roared, planes bombed, and infantry followed the mechanized units, swarming in. The Rotterdam garrison appeared on the screen, waving a white flag to surrender.</p>
<p>The German army's invasion of Leuven, attack on Dunkirk, and entry into Paris are all highlights of the "West Front Film." The scene of their entry into Paris was magnificent. General von Brauchitsch, the German commander, reviewed the German troops coming from the Champs-Élysées on the Avenue Foch. The picture had the Arc de Triomphe as the background and was a proud work of the German photographer. Another shot was of the awarding of medals in front of the Arc de Triomphe and the "eternal flame" in front of the graves of the war dead in the European War. The flame was burning brightly, and the tongue of fire was leaping, with no change. The brave soldiers sleeping in this tomb did not know that the German army's iron hooves had already arrived in their homeland. It was also a tragedy.</p>
<p>After the lively scene of the meeting between the German and French heads of state in Munich, this film came to an end. The ending was a tragic scene in the Forest of Compiègne. (See the European War Talk in this newspaper, No. 10.) First, when Hitler heard the news in the army that Pétain had expressed his desire for an armistice and peace, his state of complacency was such that he could not help but dance with his hands and feet. The film showed Hitler suddenly stretching out both arms and then raising his right foot to make a very light and quick turn. Also, when he was walking with General Göring in the forest, the leisurely and intimate feelings were vividly displayed on the screen. In this film of killing and terrible war, it is rare to get these two relaxing scenes! In front of the Compiègne Forest Square, there was a dining car parked. Hitler and General Keitel and others got into the car for a long time, and the French representatives also came slowly. Then, Hitler got out of the car first, the music played loudly, and he drove back to Germany with the glory of his victory. On the other hand, the French representatives got out of the car and walked into a small tent next to the square, accompanied by a German officer. After the four French representatives entered the tent, the German officer pulled the curtain up, and the audience lost sight of the four representatives. In fact, they were consulting with the Vichy side by telephone about the armistice terms granted by the German side. Their pain can be imagined. The German officer's small action of pulling the "curtain" cannot but make people sigh!</p>
<p>At 6:15, the whole film was finished, and the whole room regained its light. The visitors were happy, because the tense atmosphere of two hours was finally relieved.</p>

<h3>Bloodshed Repeatedly Occurs in Controlled Areas, Japanese Side Implements Strict Searches, Severity and Tediousness Unprecedented, Yu Yuan Road Northern District Just Recently Opened, Southern District Searched Yesterday, Many Residents Alarmed</h3>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reports that a Japanese military policeman was stabbed to death on the side of Yu Yuan Road last Friday. The Japanese military authorities immediately imposed a blockade on the area, isolating the area north of Yu Yuan Road from the outside world for a full twenty-four hours. The blockade was lifted at 5:30 PM last night (the 20th), and the unrest and anxiety of the residents in the area also came to an end.</p>
<p>Food Supplies All Interrupted</p>
<p>During this 24-hour blockade, the food and other supplies for Chinese residents in Lane 668 and Lane 608 of Yu Yuan Road, which lead to the location where the Japanese military policeman was stabbed, were all interrupted. The delivery of milk, bread, and newspapers to a few foreigners was also prevented. Prior to this, the aforementioned two lanes had been guarded by "city police" since Friday.</p>
<p>Chinese Inside Lanes All Prohibited from Passing</p>
<p>On Saturday night, several teams of Japanese military police arrived. Without warning, they erected barbed wire barriers at the entrances, obstructing pedestrian traffic. This continued until last night. Japanese soldiers did not interfere with foreigners, except for one instance where a sentry seemed to misunderstand his orders and hindered a certain foreigner's movement. However, all Chinese were prohibited from passing.</p>
<p>Door-to-Door Flag Sales, Soaked Through</p>
<p>Initially, no search teams appeared in the area, so people did not understand the Japanese side's motives. It wasn't until nearly noon that a small team of Japanese soldiers and "city police" went door-to-door in the two lanes "selling" one Japanese flag and one Nanjing (puppet government) flag each, and forced residents to hang both flags prominently on their doors or roofs. Residents were already worried about not getting food until the assassin was captured. In the afternoon, they were forced to buy and hang flags. Coincidentally, it was drizzling, and the flags were soaked and drooping dejectedly. It is unknown whether the Japanese authorities lifted the blockade suddenly in the evening due to the rain or because they realized they could not capture the assassin. After dark, food and other supplies were brought in continuously.</p>
<p>Strict Searches, Unprecedented</p>
<p>Since the assassinations of Zhang Xiaolin and Japanese military police Sergeant Saito, the Japanese authorities in Shanghai have been conducting systematic searches of pedestrians and vehicles in their controlled areas for the past week. The strictness is unprecedented in the past year. The measures recently adopted in the Hongkou area are particularly severe. Japanese naval landing force soldiers are stationed on the Feilun Road Bridge, searching pedestrians and vehicles to prevent the concealment of weapons, which has been going on for several days. Pedestrians arriving here line up in long queues, being searched one by one, and it takes a long time to get through.</p>
<p>Hongkou Traffic, Exceptionally Congested</p>
<p>Those traveling by car and rickshaw are also forced to get out and be searched. In the evening, Japanese civilians in plain clothes replace the Japanese naval landing force soldiers to continue the searches tirelessly. Public buses and passengers in the Hongkou area are also subjected to the same searches, resulting in exceptionally congested traffic. The searches began to ease only yesterday.</p>
<p>Believing the Assassin is Hiding in a Certain House</p>
<p>Also, the English "China Press" reports that according to the Japanese authorities, the Japanese side believes that three assassins who ambushed the Japanese military policeman escaped into Lane 608 of Yu Yuan Road and are hiding in a certain house. Therefore, they blockaded the lane from Friday night. It is estimated that there are 4,000 residents in the lane. After the assassination of the Japanese military policeman, the Japanese authorities conducted a large-scale search in the "badlands" area of Yu Yuan Road.</p>
<p>Southern District Search</p>
<p>Japanese soldiers and so-called "police officers" stationed at the iron gates in various places in the French Concession adjacent to the Southern District, such as Xieqiao, Nanyangqiao, Dongxinqiao, and Xinkaihe, have been conducting strict searches of pedestrians entering and leaving since 6:00 AM yesterday. Any citizen who did not carry a "citizen's certificate" was blocked outside the iron gate, not allowed to enter or exit. At one point, hundreds of people were blocked. Residents living in the Southern District who wanted to enter the concession through the iron gate were also blocked and turned back. Some who had recently moved into the Southern District did not have "citizen's certificates" and were panicked, unable to enter the concession. As for the reason for this sudden Japanese inspection, one theory is that it was to rigorously pursue the fugitive murderer after the assassination of Zhang Xiaolin, and another is that it was due to the assassination of a Japanese military officer in Western Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Bloodshed at the Da Zhonghua Hotel: Principal Culprit Shot Dead, Four Accomplices Detained Pending Investigation</h3>
<p>In room 628 of the Da Zhonghua Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road, a shooting assassination occurred at 9:00 PM on July 16th of this year. Hou Nianyan and Xu Zhenhua in the room were both seriously injured and died. Fan Fayuan (manager of the Lihai Company at 107 Jiangxi Road) was wounded in the neck. The perpetrators all escaped. After investigation by Chinese detectives Zhou Kaiwen and Han Shoushan of the General Inspectorate, the suspects Feng Liheng, Cai Xiaozheng, Yu Yuechu, Dong Zhengnan, Wu Amo, Qiu Yongtang, Qiu Ahai, Sun Zilong, etc., were apprehended. According to</p>
<p>Cai's Confession</p>
<p>they indeed participated in the assassination of Hou Nianyan and others at that time. The three suspects Feng, Yu, and Dong also participated. As for the principal culprit, it was a person named Wei Yaosheng. As for why Wei wanted to assassinate Hou and others, he did not explicitly say beforehand, so it is unknown. However, according to the investigation by the Inspectorate, the occurrence of this assassination incident is closely related to the gambling dens in Western Shanghai. As for the principal culprit in this case, Wei Yaosheng, he was also shot and killed on Gordon Road 28 days after the murder (i.e., August 14th). Therefore,</p>
<p>the Cause of This Case</p>
<p>cannot be known in detail. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special District. Inspectorate lawyer Qian Xunjiu, based on the criminal law of murder and attempted murder, filed charges against Feng Liheng, Cai Xiaozheng, Yu Yuechu, and Dong Zhengnan. As for the remaining suspects, finding no connection, he requested that they be released. After Judge Feng Shide verified and reported, he issued an order to detain them for further verification after questioning the defendants. Those against whom no charges were filed were released.</p>
<h3>Illegally Melting Copper Coins for Profit, Accountant Detained</h3>
<p>Chinese detective Huang Fugen and detective Zhao Yongqing of the Hongkou Inspectorate learned that someone was illegally collecting a large amount of copper coins at 315 Gongping Road, melting them down, and selling them to a certain party for multiple times the profit. At 11:20 AM the day before yesterday, they rushed to search the premises with Western detectives. The principal culprit, Du Lixiang from Nanjing, had already fled upon hearing the news. They arrested the accountant, Zhang Shunxing from Nanjing, and took him to the Inspectorate, along with 74 melted copper ingots, weighing over 100 catties. Yesterday, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the Special Court. Inspectorate lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that he should be detained. Judge Huang Risheng briefly questioned Zhang, but his testimony was evasive, so he was ordered to be detained again for further verification.</p>
<h3>Adultery Conviction, Wife Seeks Divorce, Settlement Reached in Court</h3>
<p>Chen Xinwu, from Jiading, is 27 years old and lives at 36 Zhenhua Lane, Malong Road. He is the son of Chen Jiro, a giant in the tea and snack industry, and currently works as an accountant at the wild water chestnut candy store on Avenue Joffre. In 1934, he married Cao Junying, of the same hometown and age, and they have a son and a daughter. However, Chen is a playboy who frequents dance halls, leading to an inseparable relationship with Lu Ying, a Guangdong dancer. From then on, he discarded his wife like worn-out shoes. Cao made every effort to investigate and learned of their hideout, reporting the information to the French Inspectorate, who arrested them and escorted them to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special District. They were sentenced to four months' imprisonment for adultery and three months' imprisonment for opium use, to be served concurrently for six months. The case has been finalized and executed. Now, Cao has filed a separate lawsuit against Chen for divorce. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Shen convened the Fourth Civil Court for mediation. A settlement was reached in court, with Chen paying 3,000 yuan for the divorce and 3,900 yuan for child support. The children will be temporarily raised by the woman and returned to the man when they reach the age of sixteen. Both parties signed the record in court and dispersed.</p>

<p>Shi Dezhi, a 62-year-old man from Ningbo, and his son, Shi Amao, residing at 14 East Seward Road, had been setting up a steamed bun stall on the side of East Hankou Road to make a living. Around 5:00 AM on September 25th, Shi Amao, carrying a rattan basket, intended to sell steamed buns to a refugee camp on Yuanfang Road, but mistakenly entered the Baoxing Beef Shop at 172.

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor, I am a basketball enthusiast and have never missed a game in this charity basketball challenge organized by the Orphanage. I have enjoyed watching the fierce competition between the players of each team and am very fortunate. Paramount has achieved a great record of six wins in six games, which is not unexpected. However, the strength of each team should not be underestimated. The game between Paramount and Guoguang Alumni was the most satisfying. Although Guoyou was a temporary organization formed in a hurry, with less than a week of training, their combat strategy was unique. This time, the old friends reunited and used their "five-man joint defense" skill, which was so strict that there was no gap to take advantage of. The score on the scoreboard was constantly changing, often within one or two points. The tension and excitement of the performance were even better than the past game between Hualian and Paramount. In the end, Guoyou lost by only one point, which was not their fault. It was a matter of luck. However, it rained heavily that night, and only a few hundred fans waded through the water to attend. There must be many people who did not get to enjoy it. I would like to suggest to you, Mr. Editor, that such a close game should be replayed on a regular basis. Even if the tickets are still sold for five or ten yuan, I believe there will be many enthusiastic people in Shanghai who will be happy to contribute. You, Mr. Editor, advocate sports and are kind and compassionate, which I admire very much. I hope you will make a call to action and promote its success, which will not only be a blessing for the fans, but also benefit thousands of orphans. With respect, Wang Wenchao, October 21st.</p>

<h3>Finance - Cash Not Used for Futures - "Haxia" Crushes Short Sellers - Half-Month Term Restores Futures - Trading Suspended Yesterday for This Reason</h3>
<p>Since the margin market was suspended at 823, the Gold Exchange Employees organized a "Haxia" market to conduct trading in a certain bank. At that time, only 12 silver building groups, 5 gold shops, and more than 20 money exchange businesses participated in the transaction. Market price fluctuations often followed foreign exchange rate changes. However, recently, it has reversed the normal pattern, with foreign exchange rates trending loosely, while "Haxia" has diverged and frequently risen, forming a short squeeze trend in the past week. From the 14th to the 19th, short sellers were constantly squeezed and painfully closed their positions. There are three main reasons for this:</p>
<p>(1) Shanghai is full of idle funds that cannot be used. After the "May 2nd" turmoil, interest in hoarding goods and speculating in foreign stocks gradually waned, and hedging foreign exchange was also avoided due to the unpredictable situation in the Pacific. Therefore, most of them shifted their target and competed to purchase "Haxia", especially those in Hong Kong. At the same time, after the bank reduced interest rates, those who had wealth believed that it would be better to convert their legal currency into gold and store it in a safe deposit box rather than deposit it in the bank.</p>
<p>(2) Although the situation in the Pacific is unpredictable, the overall outlook is bearish, so there are many short sellers. In the past, if there were floating short or long positions that could not be closed, colleagues could negotiate a delay in delivery, but now, due to the large amounts involved, it is not possible to accommodate.</p>
<p>(3) Speculators have different opinions on the current situation, and each has their own view. Therefore, long positions with strength secretly colluded to raise prices and search for purchases in order to carry out the trick of manipulating the market. Therefore, they put great pressure on the short side, tightened the "Haxia" chips, and did not release them, so that after the market price rose sharply, they could come out at a high price. Therefore, when the market price reached 5,900 yuan on the 19th, the silver building group had real goods flowing out.</p>
<p>With Shanghai's limited "Haxia" chips, after endless purchases by various parties and the manipulation of long positions to squeeze shorts, the market price naturally soared and diverged from the foreign exchange rate. The market side decided on the 19th that all transactions up to the closing price on that day would be settled at the closing price of the U.S. dollar (5.84375), which was equal to 5,984 yuan (also written as 90 yuan or 89 yuan and 2 jiao), and all long and short positions would be closed together. This was a difference of 160 yuan higher than the closing price on the 19th, and the short side suffered a great loss at this price. Therefore, yesterday, a method was decided that whether real goods were received and delivered or settled at the closing price, all long and short positions would be closed at the closing price of 5,830 yuan on the afternoon of the 19th. Therefore, "Haxia" was not traded yesterday. At the same time, it was decided to open futures trading from today, with settlement every half month. If there is no delivery of goods upon expiration, the term can be extended by paying interest, which is to restore the previous margin market trading method. As for the margin, it is set at 401 yuan per bar, and it has been decided to open the market as usual today (12th). (Holy)</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Spot - Almost Equalized</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, the exchange rate listed, there was no rise or fall. The dark market for British and American exchange rates was stable and flat. Initially, the yarn flower group and British and American tobacco companies had some settlement of payments, which slightly softened the market. However, the futures price and the spot price once equalized. Later, Chinese banks sold out, and the need for transfers decreased, so the market became looser. As a result, it was not much different from last Saturday. The futures and spot prices still had a slight gap.</p>
<h3>Yarn Flower Group Settles Forward U.S. Dollars</h3>
<p>In the early morning, the exchange rate, the British exchange rate against Shanghai, etc. were all flat, the U.S. exchange rate against the British exchange rate did not change, and against Shanghai, it was three cents higher. The central listing for the French exchange rate, etc. remained the same. When the banks opened in the morning, the spot selling price was 3 shillings, 7.96875 pence for British gold and 5.84375 yuan for U.S. dollars, which was the same for both British and U.S. exchange rates as at the close of last Saturday. After the opening, speculators sold as before. The speculator's income for this month's U.S. dollar foreign exchange was 5.84375 yuan. The yarn flower group came to the market to settle forward U.S. dollars, so the market softened. The November U.S. dollar for the American yarn flower group was 5.8 [unclear]. The HSBC listing was announced and did not move. The silver balancing tax was announced and there were no increases or decreases. After that, the British and American tobacco companies also slightly purchased U.S. dollars for distant months, with a certain American bank selling the December rate for 5.8125 yuan. By noon, speculators saw the trend and followed, and the U.S. dollars for this month were all announced at 5.8125 yuan. The closing price was equal to the spot price, with British gold at 3 shillings and 7.8125 pence and U.S. dollars at 5.8125 yuan, a decrease of 0.0565 pence for British gold and 0.03125 yuan for U.S. dollars compared to the morning opening.</p>
<h3>Chinese Merchants Sell Heavily Again in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>In the afternoon, Chinese banks sold heavily, and the market hardened. It is estimated that the East Asia Bank sold this month's U.S. dollars for 5.84375 yuan to a certain American bank and favorably. However, the market was extremely quiet afterwards, and there were not many transactions. The closing price for British gold was 3 shillings and 7.96875 pence, and for U.S. dollars, it was 5.84375 yuan, the same price as the spot price for this month. Next month's British gold was 3 shillings and 7.8125 pence, and U.S. dollars were 5.8125 yuan. Compared to the close of last weekend, British and U.S. exchange rates showed no gain or loss.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Exchange Rate Very Stable</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, 21st (Monday) telegram, today the exchange market opened steadily, and there was no change in the British, Japanese, and Shanghai exchange rates (the Shanghai exchange rate closed at noon last Saturday at 392 yuan). The spot U.S. dollar was 0.0625 lower, at 23.0625 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by 1 yuan at noon, to 393 yuan. The market opened steadily at 2:30 PM, and the spot U.S. dollar was 0.0625 higher, at 23 yuan. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Tianjin British and American Rates Loosen</h3>
<p>Tianjin, 21st (Monday) telegram, the exchange market opened this morning, with the London telegraphic transfer rate loosening by 0.03125, to 3 pence 65615. The New York telegraphic transfer rate hardened by 0.0625, to 5.65625 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate dropped by 0.5 jiao, to 100.4 yuan (joint note). The black market also rose by 0.25 yuan, to 77.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sudden Demand for British Pound Notes</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation, the "Haxia" market was closed, and the shouted price outside the market was slightly weak, so British and American gold pounds also fell by one yuan together. There was a sudden demand for British gold notes, and the market price trended up by one yuan. American gold notes fluctuated between 16.53 yuan and 16.64 yuan, eventually reaching 16.55 yuan, a slight increase of 0.01 yuan compared to last Saturday. The supply and demand of Hong Kong notes were even, and the market price remained flat. The trend of Japanese gold notes and Korean notes was very strong, and the market price increased steadily. The former rose to 1.41 yuan again, and the latter continued to rise to 1.19 yuan.</p>
<h3>Oil Cake - Bulls and Bears Fighting in the Oil Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's edible oil market situation, the market continued the tight situation at the close of last Saturday in the early morning, so the opening price slightly decreased by 1.3 yuan. After the opening, the floating stocks were strong, so the market went downstream. The lowest price was reduced by 12 yuan compared to the opening price. In the afternoon, rumors spread that the Qingdao market price was reported to be built, so the market atmosphere rose immediately, and the price jumped by more than 1 yuan. As a result, it was only slightly repaired by about 0.5 yuan. It is estimated that the transaction was made by Dayou Factory, 400 dan of oil, the price was 86 yuan, falling to 84.5 yuan, and then rising to 85 yuan. Peanut oil was made for 50 pieces of Jiaozhou spot oil, the price was 70.05 yuan, and 50 pieces were called for delivery on Sunday, the price was 72 yuan. Qingdao oil was ordered for 200 barrels for delivery in November, the price was 102 yuan, the opening price fell straight to 100 yuan, and then closed at 101.5 yuan. 300 barrels were ordered for delivery at the end of November, the price was 104 yuan, falling to 03 yuan at the close. At the moment, people's hearts have turned into a state of circling. The daily transaction has also been reduced. The overall situation has a potential for brewing and not dissolving. To make it clear, it is necessary to see the solution to the moving certificate problem before we can distinguish who wins more or less.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 2,210 packages of soybeans came from Tianjin. Today, there are 395 packages of beans, 1,600 pieces of bean cake, 2,000 packages of bran, and 370 packages of sorghum shipped to Xiamen. Yesterday, there were also 1,000 cans of tung oil from Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Grain - If You Don't Buy Gold, You Buy Rice - Speculators Causing Trouble Everywhere</h3>
<p>The price of foreign rice rose first and then fell yesterday, and the market still turned flat. In the early morning, floating households inside and outside the industry blindly absorbed the market, seeing the squeeze in the gold market and the rise in cotton yarn. Some speculative customers engaged in "Haxia" and futures transactions turned to the rice market because of the settlement price suspension. As a result, the rice market suddenly showed a lively and prosperous atmosphere, and the price of each foreign rice was immediately raised by 0.5 yuan to 0.7 or 0.8 yuan with enthusiastic buying. However, the industry leaders and major households did not inquire, and those who asked were all speculative scalping transactions. Actual sales were still bleak. Those who profited took the opportunity to sell at a high price, so the market price rose, the selling atmosphere suddenly rose, and the market gradually fell back. By noon, it was close to the previous closing price. There were fewer ins and outs in the afternoon, and the market was unchanged. New transactions were not opened. The re-imported Yinghua Company original package No. 2 Saigon spot was opened at 74 yuan, and the road goods for delivery next month were 73.2 yuan. More than 100 tons were opened, and nearly 10,000 packages of spot rice were transacted.</p>
<p>Although the arrival of new japonica rice and Yaozhong wild rice was not prosperous, only a total of 1,000 packages arrived. However, due to the rain, the general guests were afraid of water stains. The new goods were not strong and rarely made progress. The owners had the same mentality and also sought to sell quickly, resulting in a difficult price. New japonica rice was down by 1 or 2 yuan. Kunshan goods opened at 73 yuan, and those around Minhang were only 70 yuan. The original package of high-quality goods was 76 or 77 yuan. As for guest species and wild rice, the owners still tried to hold the price because of the scarcity of goods, so they did not open the market. Du Yangjian was also down by a small amount. Qingjiao Du Jian original package opened at 69 yuan, and the price per load was 65 yuan. Taicang Yangjian original package was 69 yuan, and broken japonica rice was only 82 or 83 yuan for ordinary japonica rice. As for Nangang early broken rice, all were not opened.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice, both domestic and foreign, was still unusually strong due to the activities of wine users. The market price continued to increase by 0.5 yuan to 1 yuan. Yili domestic rice opened at 78 yuan, and Hong Kong special yuan opened at 76 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign rice is not [unclear] arriving in Shanghai. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Anshun wheel transported 5466 packages from Hong Kong, and the Hunan wheel also loaded 8457 packages from Hong Kong. The two ships loaded a total of 13923 packages of foreign rice and arrived at the port one after another yesterday morning, berthing at the bank's wharf in the French Concession and were being unloaded. (Zu)</p>
<p>Flour - Yesterday, No. 1 flour factory's list price was changed to 17 yuan, a sudden increase of 0.5 yuan. Since the price of re-imported goods has been expensive, each factory has been intending to raise the price due to the lack of raw materials and high costs. However, the authorities in the concession have restrained the price increase and maintained the nature of the street, so they have not immediately increased the price. Until yesterday, they started to increase the price by 0.5 yuan again. The re-imported goods market has gradually become peaceful last weekend. Now that the factory price has been increased, the situation will inevitably tighten again. It is heard that the old car brand price is 19.34 yuan, and the price of foreign flour is approaching the 20 yuan mark due to the lack of fixed orders. However, transactions have not yet started. The total market, in addition to the two factories selling more than 8,000 packages, other transactions are less than 5,000 packages.</p>
<h3>Lack of Raw Materials - Factory Price Suddenly Increases by 0.5 Yuan</h3>
<p>Wheat - Yesterday's wheat market was as silent as usual. The domestic supply source has been scarce for a long time, the Japanese factory's import price is limited, and the Chinese factory's price limit is 25 yuan, which is difficult to approach. Therefore, only a little is sold to solve the factory's goods every day. It is heard that recently there have been rumors that the factory has a new fixed foreign wheat, but it has not yet been confirmed.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods - Walnut Drops Back</h3>
<p>Walnuts - The market has suddenly softened due to the strong source, totaling thousands of pieces. Also, the previous market has risen too fast, which is not without reason. Yesterday, 200 pieces of Qingzhou peach were opened, the price opened at 80 yuan, down 14 yuan. 100 pieces of Ti Tao, 86 yuan. The peach meat rose instead, opening at 126 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn - Hong Kong Brokers Coarse Yarn - Yarn Market Has Strong Rise Force</h3>
<p>The yarn market has rebounded, and the rise force is very strong. This is because the Hong Kong brokers have a smooth appetite for 10-count coarse yarn and are eager to collect it in the market, which has aroused people's enthusiasm. Speculative buying is flourishing, and the market has reappeared at a new peak. However, colleagues and factories have been selling consistently, and the momentum is still outstanding. 20-count Double Horse has reached 1285 yuan. The Shanghai New 9 Factory opened 2700 packages of 20-count Tiannv yarn at 1170 yuan including positive.</p>
<p>The spot yarn opened in the morning, and the market was peaceful. The price of 20-count Double Horse was 1256 yuan. Most of the colleagues sold out. After a short while, it slightly decreased to 1248 yuan, and it circulated at 12556 yuan for a long time. Afterwards, it was heard that the Hong Kong brokers were searching for coarse yarn quite vigorously, and the selling price jumped by 230 yuan. The people's hearts were shaken, and the gold shop and securities were good at speculative actions. Seeing the wind, they unanimously raised the price, and the market rose in a straight line to 1285 yuan. Profitable long positions were sold out, and the market returned to 1176 yuan. The closing price was 1181 yuan. Checking the transaction in half a day, a total of 5790 packages were traded, and the price rose by 20 yuan. 20 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Xiamen on the 20th, and 245 pieces were transported to Hong Kong. The amount of money bought by each broker is as follows: 4110 pieces by the same line, and 680 pieces by Hong Kong. Statistics, 5790 pieces.</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Transactions Increasingly Active</h3>
<p>The spot cotton situation is also firm, but transactions are still dominated by colleagues' buying and selling, which is more prosperous.</p>
<p>MT 283.00 Colleagues Buy 131 pieces</p>
<p>Su Zhonger 268.00 Another 100 pieces</p>
<p>Special White Loke 253.00 Xinsheng Buy 100 pieces</p>
<p>Fine Velvet Packaging 260.00 Another 278 pieces</p>
<p>Beitaicang 215.00 Colleagues Buy 600 bags</p>
<p>Grass Package 206.00 Another 300 bags</p>
<p>Pingguoer 165.00</p>
<p>164.00 Another 400 pieces</p>
<p>166.00</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Price, New York Cotton Market, the market was quiet, and colleagues made some purchases. Afterwards, the closing price was lower than the previous day by 12 pounds due to the selling of the Southern brokers. Indian even with predictions rose by more than one rupee.</p>
<p>Another message, the transaction of foreign cotton in the Shanghai port has become increasingly active in recent days. Because the stock on the market is not abundant, transactions cannot be opened in large quantities. Many colleagues have ordered goods for shipment. When this order arrives at the port, the cotton price can be slightly delayed.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods - Hong Kong and Guangdong Brokers Handle National Cloth - Some Piece Goods Are Transported to Hong Kong for Transfer to Rangoon</h3>
<p>National Cloth - Yesterday, the market trend was firm and expensive, which was due to the strong demand from the Guangdong and Hong Kong brokers. Colleagues' thoughts and business tended to buy. The morning market was very little changed. Fugui Fine Twill shouted to sell for 30.067 yuan, but there was not much transaction. In the later market, the demand increased sharply, and it was gradually drawn to 31 yuan. Fugui fine cloth was 33 yuan. Other fine cloth, fine twill bleached cloth also shouted high by 0.25 yuan to 0.5 yuan per piece. Coarse cloth rose by 0.1 yuan to 0.25 yuan per piece.

Guangdong and Hong Kong brokers handled 300 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Zhejiang and Fujian brokers also handled 200 pieces of colored cloth and fine [unclear]. Tianjin brokers handled more than 100 pieces of blue cloth and coarse cloth.</p>
<p>Dongbu - Initially tired, finally firm, especially outstanding at the close. Fine cloth and fine twill rose by 0.5 yuan per piece compared to last week. Serge rose by a fraction of a yard. The closing price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 38.35 yuan. Four Gentlemen Serge was 1 yuan and [unclear]625 jiao.</p>
<p>Export - Today, 180 pieces of piece goods will be transported to Hong Kong for transfer to Rangoon, 950 pieces will be transported to Hong Kong, and another 57 pieces will be transported to Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Woolen Cloth in the Lower Grade Is More Popular</h3>
<p>Woolen Cloth - The trend is firm and stable, and sales are good in both retail and wholesale. Transactions for men's and women's colors and linings are quite prosperous. Due to traffic jams and the restriction of control, although the guests have tried to transport the goods, the number is small. Therefore, 70 to 80% are sold in this street. Looking at the current era of rising prices, woolen cloth is also following suit, but its purchasing power is gradually weakening. Therefore, the lower-grade goods are more popular. Woolen cloth with a price of more than 1 yuan per yard, regardless of thickness, is suitable for Chinese and Western clothing, and sales are booming. The lower-grade goods with cheap prices in the past have long been collected. Shenzhi's own factory has lower-grade goods, and the rest are only for production. Yesterday, Meilun Santa Claus Hailisi and Ban Si Ne were sold together for 11 yuan. Gongda was 13 yuan to 14 yuan. Zhanghua Uniform Ne was 9.25 yuan. Daye Lion Dance single width was 4.5 yuan. Overcoat Ne double width was 12.5 yuan. Hailin stick double width was 13.5 yuan. Daye Ne single width was 2.2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Seafood - Raw Starch Sales Turn Active</h3>
<p>The sales of raw starch have turned active recently, and the stock is gradually scarce, so the trend is firm. The market has risen by 5 yuan. It is estimated that Feiqilin brand is sold for 70 yuan. People's gun 2X, KG, and 3 standard are sold for 69 yuan. Iron Anchor brand is 60 yuan. Double T standard is 57 yuan. No. 3 is 46 yuan, the price is more than 10 yuan lower than the initial market.</p>
<h3>Xiangshan Shrimp Tails涌到, The Price Is More Than 10 Yuan Lower Than the Initial Market</h3>
<p>Both Western shrimp tails, such as Xiangshan goods, are见湧来. For example, those sold yesterday were 410 yuan, and the goods were excellent. However, compared to the initial market, they must be 40 yuan lower. However, the sales are still good, and the future market is expected to bottom out.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market - Che Chibai Gradually Loosens - The Main Continues at Four Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to lengthen outside the exchange, and it gradually loosened again. The association's drawing was that the spot price of 24 coarse white 本棧 was 74.7 yuan, the outside 棧 was 74.2 yuan, and the transshipment goods were 59 yuan. There were few changes. The Dutch赤 continued to drop by 0.8 jiao, initially at 56 yuan, and then dropped to 55.8 jiao and 5 jiao. Taikoo's 车白 B mark West 棧 was 72.7 yuan, 小三角. Dong 棧 was 72.5 yuan, to 72 yuan, 小八角. CW mark West 棧 was 72.2 yuan, 小三角. DY mark was 68.3 jiao, 小八角. HX mark was 68.3 jiao to 68 yuan, a decrease of 0.7 yuan to 1 yuan. H mark 车赤 was 55 yuan, a decrease of 1 yuan. The main factory's white ice has not been traded for many days due to the fall in coarse sand. Yesterday, the opening price for No. 1 ice was 94.5 yuan, and for Jingming ice was 96 yuan, with a decrease of 4 yuan before and after. The domestic sugar source is scarce, the number of goods has not been opened, and the stock is not much.</p>
<h3>Metals: Market Outlook Prosperous</h3>
<p>New coils are selling briskly, with nail factories, lead wire factories, and screw factories all resuming operations. Speculators are also actively involved, with over 1,000 piculs traded yesterday. Prices ranged from 56.5 to 57.25 yuan per picul, a rise of over one yuan compared to previous prices. Although existing stocks are abundant, the cost of import is around 60 yuan, so industry players are collectively raising prices. Furthermore, foreign firms have already sold out their spot goods, so the market outlook is expected to rise steadily.</p>
<p>Factories producing galvanized iron, thermos bottles, toys, and biscuits are also being actively purchased yesterday, and there is limited circulating stock in the market, resulting in market inflation. Due to increased war risk surcharges and shipping costs, overseas prices have risen to 9.75 (US dollars), equivalent to an import cost of 180 yuan based on recent exchange rates, which is 10 yuan higher than Shanghai prices. Consequently, those holding goods are reluctant to sell at low prices, and the market outlook is very optimistic.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Increased Prices for Amomum Villosum</h3>
<p>There has recently been a lack of continuous arrivals of Amomum villosum, and high-quality goods are particularly scarce. Therefore, well-dried goods are up by five yuan and are now selling for eighty yuan. However, lower-quality goods are seeing few buyers, even at low prices.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Reaches New Highs—A Fleeting Opportunity</h3>
<p>The grey market for securities saw further prosperity yesterday. Class C bonds traded above 60 yuan, and Class E bonds also reached a new high of 60 yuan. The market reached new highs across the board, marking the highest levels since August 13th. The momentum is unprecedented. This is because the gold market was unable to open yesterday due to issues, causing speculators to flock to the government bond market with substantial capital. Their efforts were further supported by a new loan of 50 million US dollars, creating a fleeting opportunity. Gatherings became crowded, buying interest surged, and the market was filled with bullish sentiment. In the afternoon, a certain bank sold 300,000 to 400,000 units, causing a slight setback at the peak. Some bulls took profits, but prices remained relatively high. The future may see a slight pullback before another push towards new highs. Yesterday morning, Zhenkang was the first to buy, followed by Renchang, Maotai, and Lemao. Hu Heji, Hengfu, and Lianyi also engaged in acquisition, but the large supply from Hongda and Yitai was ineffective. All bonds reached new highs. In the afternoon, Jiufeng, Lianyi, Tongkang, and Dasheng all vigorously bought, pushing Class C bonds above 60 yuan and Class E bonds to 60 yuan. Subsequently, Songmao, on behalf of a certain bank, sold 300,000 to 400,000 yuan of Class E bonds, increasing supply. Selling pressure from various parties gradually increased, and Hongda resumed selling. Datong, Tongshun, and Xinfu also sold, causing prices to fall by a small margin of 0.03 to 0.05 yuan, but closing prices mostly remained above the morning's closing prices. Ultimately, Class D bonds saw the largest increase, rising by 1.6 yuan, while the rest rose by 0.07 to 0.08 yuan each. The total transaction volume was approximately 2 million yuan. A summary table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Compared to Previous Day</p>

<p>Stock trading saw 200 shares of Xinya Pharmaceutical traded at a price of 24.7 yuan.</p>
<p>The overall stock market opened exceptionally strong, prompting profit-taking from last week's bulls. Prices rose and then gradually declined, but the closing was stable with extremely high trading volume. There was increased interest in various rubber stocks.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Editor's Note</h3>
<p>— The Editor</p>
<p>Regarding the question of whether it is a sacrifice for women with higher education to return to their families, we have published several articles in the past. Recently, due to the publication of some timely articles, and because the submitted articles discussing women's issues were relatively crowded, and it took time to organize them, we have stopped publishing them several times. Now, the submitted articles have been organized, but because the "Free Talk" section is small, and it is not convenient to use the entire section to discuss women's paths, we can only select a portion of the articles more strictly to publish them successively. We will pay special attention to the opinions and personal experiences of women themselves.</p>
<p>Regarding the question of "Is it a sacrifice?", Mr. Chen Ming has submitted another article, "Revisiting Sacrifice," stating that his "original intention was not to advocate that all women should take the path of family." He "acknowledges that women should occupy the same position as men in society, but under the premise that the family system cannot be abolished or changed in the present (and near future), it should also be a career for a large part of women to voluntarily or passively return to their families to fulfill their responsibilities, and should not be regarded as a sacrifice." He also mentioned the unreliability of entrusting all housework to servants.</p>
<p>Regarding this point, Ms. Xu Jian feels that social service and managing a home can be balanced, and there are facts to prove it.</p>
<p>Ms. A Pin's "Living for Others" depicts the suffering of a woman in an old family, as well as her efforts after gaining freedom. Her valuable opinions are especially worth our attention.</p>
<p>Family</p>
<h3>Living for Others</h3>
<p>— A Pin</p>
<p>I am not a graduate of a certain university or middle school, nor have I ever been active in society. I am just an unfortunate woman who was sent to a large family after only five years of primary school and was tightly bound by old etiquette for six years.</p>
<p>In a large family, especially one with some assets and feudal remnants, the oppression and suffering experienced by a daughter-in-law are indescribable. The stern faces of the parents-in-law, the infighting among sisters-in-law, the difficulties caused by the sisters-in-law, and the secret deception by servants, all caused immense suffering to a seventeen-year-old me. My body belonged to my parents-in-law, not to my husband. Other than secretly exchanging a few words at night, we were absolutely not allowed to talk at other times. Even if I encouraged my husband to seek knowledge or correct a mistake, labels like "afraid of his wife" and "henpecked" would be applied to both of us. Flattering the parents-in-law, sucking up to the sisters-in-law, and running errands for the sisters-in-law were my duties. I did not live for myself, not for my husband, and certainly not for my children. Day and night, I toiled for the parents-in-law, sisters-in-law, and sisters-in-law, always with a smiling face. A slight slip-up would result in the grave sin of "unfilial piety." Let alone social activities, even leaving the house was difficult. I simply lived mechanically and aimlessly for others!</p>
<p>With a loud bang, the artillery roared, the family property was destroyed, and the feudal large family could no longer bind me. My husband, children, and I quietly came to Shanghai amidst the raging fires and opened a small shop that barely provided a livelihood. Although we suffered from economic hardship, I was finally free.</p>
<p>The first priority after gaining freedom was to seek knowledge again. I knew that shallow knowledge could not adapt to future society. Although six years of confinement had turned me into a frail woman like Lin Daiyu, and the decline of the family fortune made financial resources tight, neither financial nor mental strength allowed me to seek more knowledge. However, I chose courses that suited my personality and studied diligently on my own, in preparation for future applications.</p>
<p>It is not just the aversion caused by six years of confinement in a large family that makes me disapprove of Hitler's style of confining women to their families. It is truly my heartfelt feeling that if we women adhere to old-fashioned ideals and bury ourselves in our families, we will never be able to adapt to modern trends. At the very least, after stability and the blood baptism, China needs a large number of citizens to take on the responsibility of nation-building. We are also part of the citizens, and we bear the same responsibility to our motherland. What should we, the female compatriots who make up half of the population, do to encourage ourselves during this time of national crisis? When society needs us, we can raise our arms and work hard to create a perfect country for our great China and open up a bright path for our women! To do work that is more important than comforting our husbands and raising our children!</p>
<p>Women</p>
<h3>Can Be Balanced</h3>
<p>— Xu Jian</p>
<p>The organization of a family is not necessarily as simple as unmarried men and women imagine. Indeed, educating children and managing complex household affairs are burdens that women cannot put down in today's society, before nurseries and public canteens are established. As a wife and mother, it is certainly unacceptable to abandon the family and disregard the family in order to focus on work in society. However, to bury a woman's entire spirit solely for the sake of raising children and keeping the family tidy, believing that this is a woman's career, is also a bit too cruel! Under the cries of "gender equality" and "women's liberation," we fortunate few have been able to receive knowledge on the same footing as men and be nurtured and valued by society. Then, after "achieving academic success," we should contribute all our abilities in the same way as men, to repay the country and society. We can manage the household and educate our children on the one hand, but on the other hand, we must also go out into society to work.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people think I am dreaming, but hold on; the facts are the most reasonable witness. I myself grew up in such a family. My father held positions in education, journalism, and politics throughout his life and never retired, while my mother served in education for twenty years. Before marriage, she was a good teacher to her students, and she remained so after marriage. She did not abandon her responsibility to serve society because of her family. Although my father wanted her to resign because he was concerned about her overwork, she never neglected her duties. And our family did not become chaotic because of my mother's job. After setting certain rules for housework, it became a habit, and it was not difficult to manage. I also know many housewives who participate in social activities as much as possible while managing their households and raising their children. Their families are also well-organized. This makes me feel that managing a household and holding a job can be done simultaneously.</p>
<p>Therefore, I feel that a well-educated housewife, a modern woman, should have the ability to manage the household, educate children, serve society, and lead the masses, so that those who do not receive light can see the light again, and those who are ignorant can be educated. We must know how great and how needed is the power of the cooperative work of our female compatriots, who make up half of the country's population. May everyone work hard!</p>
<h3>"Easy on us, Sir!"</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhiqing</p>
<p>For hunger, for delaying for a moment our insignificant lives like ants, we thronged in front of the government rice store. The fire of hunger stirred us to jostle and struggle, and the strict order was disturbed. Sir! You are the maintainers of peace, and indeed, disturbance and commotion need your whips to correct them. But, Sir! Several days of hunger have already exhausted us. How can our emaciated muscles and withered bones endure the whip? Sir! Please accept our bold request: "Easy on us, Sir! When you wield your whips." (Unpaid)</p>
<p>Hawthorne Detective Cases</p>
<h3>The Homecoming of the Dancing Queen</h3>
<p>— By Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 9: Astonishing News</p>
<p>I originally intended to seize this opportunity to search a bit, in case Old Mao might have stolen jewelry. The stolen goods would certainly not have had time to leave, and might still be in this box. I squatted down and lifted the lid of the wicker trunk a little. The trunk was locked. I had a second thought. Opening this box would certainly not be difficult, but if I immediately broke into his box, it would be too unfounded. It would be better to discuss it with Hawthorne before acting. Therefore, I stood up straight and walked out of the gatehouse.</p>
<p>As I walked onto the cement path, I saw the sunlight shining fully on the flower bed on the left. The soil of the flower bed, after being washed by last night's rain, presented a smooth and even state, just like I had seen it in the morning. Several pale red and slender monthly roses, receiving the warmth of the sunlight, were more energetic than when I saw them in the morning, as if a melancholic and sickly beauty had received some comfort, forcing out a kind of reluctant bitter smile, but the end of its life was also right in front of it. I walked up the steps of the main house and saw that although the wooden board covering the footprints at the entrance had been moved away, the messy footprints had increased quite a bit, but the previous A-shaped footprint still refused to be completely blurred, showing that the floor had not yet been wiped. I walked to the door of the drawing room, turned the doorknob, and the door was locked. I had no choice but to stand and wait. Before long, Old Mao had led Jinmei downstairs. Jinmei nodded to me and used the key in her hand to open the door of the drawing room.</p>
<p>I said to Old Mao, "I need to talk to Jinmei for a few words. You go to the gatehouse."</p>
<p>I walked into the drawing room first, and after Jinmei followed in, I closed the door of the drawing room. The scene in the room was no different from when I came in this morning, except there was one less dead person. Although the light was not very dim, due to the closing of the windows and doors, the air was very dull, and there was still a feeling of sadness in my mind, so when I sat down on the leather cushion chair next to the round table, I felt very uncomfortable mentally. Jinmei also frowned tightly, and her expression was not as calm as when I first saw her.</p>
<p>I said, "Jinmei, you sit down too. The results of our investigation into this case from all aspects show that it is very tortuous. We already know that the person who caused this tortuous situation is you."</p>
<p>The maid looked at me and said in surprise, "Me? -- Me? What? I don't understand."</p>
<p>I replied, "In other words, what you told us this morning was completely insincere, and you hid important facts, which made this matter even more complicated." (43)</p>
<h3>God in the Whirlwind (1)</h3>
<p>The ways and circumstances in which God speaks to people vary from time to time. Today's topic is to remind us of the past when God spoke to people in the whirlwind. (Job 38) The reason why the wind is called a whirlwind is because when this wind comes, it is in a spiral form, not only blowing fiercely, but also rotating in the air, small enough to make dust cover the sky, and large enough to have the power to uproot trees and shake mountains. In the history of nature, there are often records of whirlwinds causing harm. Wherever the whirlwind passes, all buildings and crops in the fields, as well as tall buildings and mansions, can be uprooted and destroyed without anything remaining.</p>
<p>The so-called God speaking to Job in the whirlwind is a metaphor, allowing us to infer Job's experience of the whirlwind. He indeed had this experience. He had seven sons, three daughters, seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred pairs of oxen, five hundred donkeys, and many male and female servants. He was an extremely wealthy man in the East. Who knew that in one day, while his children were at a banquet, a gale suddenly came from the wilderness, collapsing his house, and his children were all crushed to death. All his cattle, sheep, and camels were either robbed or suffered from plagues. He himself was covered in sores, unable to sit or lie down in peace, and in great pain. Wasn't this a sudden disaster, like a whirlwind? (Job 1:2)</p>
<p>The Book of Job also tells us that the reason why Job encountered this misfortune was because he was a completely upright man who feared God and shunned evil. (Job 1:1) The devil accused him before God, saying that his fear of God was completely hypocritical. Because his purpose was to obtain God's blessings of all his children and property. If everything he had was destroyed, he would surely change his mind and not fear God as he used to. In order to teach the people of the world and to prove Job's truthfulness, God allowed the devil to carry out the work of testing, causing his livestock to die, and his family property to be destroyed. Although Job suffered this great disaster, he still did not change his reverence for God. On the contrary, he said: "I came naked from my mother's womb, and I will also return naked. The one who gives is God, and the one who takes away is also God" (Job 1:21) (To be continued on the 27th)</p>

<h3>First Look at "Confucius"</h3>
<p>— Si Hua</p>
<p>The long-awaited Min Hua epic "Confucius" has been screened in Shanghai. I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to appreciate it, and I am reporting on my impressions.</p>
<p>Confucius' lifelong achievements, such as his philosophical thoughts, political theories, and educational methods, are the main themes of this film: "Practicing benevolence and righteousness, correcting people's hearts." Selecting historical facts, the film begins with Qi attacking Lu. The depiction of the soldiers' brutal behavior accurately portrays the darkness of that time. After Confucius appears, he narrates the current environment and immediately asks his disciples Yan Hui, Zilu, etc., about their aspirations, which leads to his discourse on "practicing benevolence and righteousness, correcting people's hearts." Afterwards, the scenes of war and Confucius teaching his disciples are contrasted, leaving a deep impression.</p>
<p>Serving in Lu, the scene transitions from lecturing the disciples to speaking to the Duke of Lu in the court, but the speeches continue uninterrupted. Confucius' achievements in governing Lu are described from the perspective of the State of Qi, followed immediately by the meeting at Jiagu. The transition is consistent and without any sense of obstruction.</p>
<p>After the Duke of Lu accepts female musicians, Confucius decides to leave Lu. The disciples are willing to follow, and his daughter bids farewell, which are all very moving. Traveling around the states is represented by many long-distance shots and maps of various places. Situations such as being trapped in Wei and Chen Cai are depicted in several scenes, describing the difficult and precarious circumstances. And twice the scene of Confucius' daughter praying for her father's safety is inserted, further moving people with the emotion of filial piety. But Confucius disregards life and death and treats all of this with equanimity, which even transforms the strong and indignant Zilu, who begins to sing and dance along with Confucius' zither music. Confucius, at an old age, travels around for reasons not for profit, on the contrary, to save the common people from misery. This spirit of self-sacrifice is something everyone should learn.</p>
<p>Near the end of the film, the depiction of Confucius' later years is very poignant: his purpose of saving the world has not been achieved, and his favorite disciples Yan Hui and Zilu die one after another, leaving only one grandson by his side. The scene of Zilu's death in battle is handled very well, but the large number of soldiers attacking Zilu is not very realistic. After Confucius' death, the film ends with a song praising Confucius.</p>
<p>The overall layout and colors of the film are solemn, the dialogue is concise and insightful, the director's skills are superb, the shots are lively, and the visuals are beautiful. It is a pity that the photography in a few places is not very clear, but the sets are very satisfying. However, the sound effects in the large scenes are slightly inferior. In terms of actors, Tang Huaiqiu's Confucius expresses Confucius' noble and great personality very well. Zhang Yi's Zilu is heroic and strong, and can develop his personality quite well. Murong Wan'er is on the screen for the first time this time, playing Nanzi. There are not many scenes, and she has not been able to fully display her acting skills.</p>
<h3>Prelude to Li Wanchun's Arrival in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Xin Sheng</p>
<p>Among the martial actors, the one who enjoyed the earliest and greatest reputation, considering both the North and the South, is only Li Wanchun. Wanchun is the son of the martial actor Li Yongli. At the age of five or six, he was able to perform various long-costumed and short-fighting plays. Compared with the child actor Liu Tianhong, who was able to sing in color at the ancestral temple at the age of eight, it is truly miraculous. This is due to extraordinary intelligence, which cannot be forced by human power. I watched Wanchun's plays between 1923 and 1932, when Wanchun had already achieved considerable fame.</p>
<p>Famous Throughout the Nine Cities</p>
<p>Plays such as "Two Generals at Changbanpo" showed his skilled prowess, completely in the style of a master. His handsome appearance is just an aside. In the autumn of 1926, he went south with Mei Wanhua to perform at the Daxin Stage (now Tianchan). At that time, Wanchun was fifteen or sixteen years old, like a spring flower just blooming, outstanding and extraordinary, beautiful and elegant, beyond description. "Two Generals," "Lin Chong's Night Flight," "Evil Tiger Village," and "Linked Rings" were all praised by word of mouth. In the past, Xie Ju praised Liu Xia with the phrase "Heroes of the Jianghan, seen in this!" I say the same of Wanchun. In recent years, Wanchun has devoted himself to monkey plays. In addition to the existing "An Tian Hui" and "Water Curtain Cave," he has also newly arranged "The Complete Monkey King," "Skull Mountain Monkey King Strikes the Corpse Demon," and "Eighteen Arhats Capture the Great Peng" full-length plays, which are performed regularly in the ancient capital, and his popularity is unmatched. In addition, plays such as "Eight Copies of the Iron Rooster," "The First Two Copies of the Wine Beggar," "Cao Ying for Twelve Years," "The Complete Ma Chao," "Kang Xiao Ba," "Eight Great Captures," "The Complete Huang Tianba," and "True and False Ouyang De" are all Wanchun's proud and popular masterpieces. If he can perform as many of them as possible during this visit to Shanghai,</p>
<p>Unique Martial Plays</p>
<p>His resulting reputation will naturally be within our expectations. If he insists on showing off his breadth of repertoire, combining civil and martial plays, or presenting a mix of Yang and Ma styles, then I dare not hope for it. In short, Wanchun is a born martial artist of exceptional talent. Whether the martial plays he performs are long or short, he is more than capable of looking down on everything in the ranks of young martial actors. After Xiao Lou, the one who is full of vitality and has inexhaustible energy is only this one person. Actors have their own specialties in learning their craft. Performing civil plays requires civil actors with talent for civil plays. If one tries to learn both, the result will be like drawing a tiger. Even if one has a particularly high talent and seems to be able to do everything, the general rule of specializing rather than generalizing should be followed. At most, one will end up being a hodgepodge. Why bother? I have known Wanchun for a long time, and our friendship is also quite deep. When he comes, in addition to expressing a warm welcome, I dare to offer a word of foolishness. I hope Wanchun will accept it. If he can deeply understand this point and move forward, he will reap both fame and fortune, and enjoy it for a lifetime. Wanchun, strive for it!</p>
<h3>Stars Trapped in a Small Building</h3>
<p>— Chou Cheng</p>
<p>Yuan Ludeng, nicknamed "Uncle Everybody," and Han Langen and Yin Xiucen, the Chinese Laurel and Hardy, sang Wang Laowu songs together in the radio station, and also took a photo together to commemorate the event. Yuan, wearing a long gown and jacket, stood in the middle with a serious expression. Han and Yin were bare-chested on the left and right, one as thin as a skeleton, the other as fat as a floating corpse; both had silly smiles, which were difficult to describe. Yesterday, the Guoguang Pharmacy opened, and they were invited to open the ceremony, and three movie stars, Li Lihua, Bai Hong, and Li Hong, were invited to cut the ribbon. Yuan, still wearing his gown and jacket, arrived the earliest and waited upstairs. After a while, he heard thunderous applause downstairs, knowing that the stars had arrived. Sure enough, Wang Dabang acted as a volunteer bodyguard, pushing his way through the crowd. Han shouted that he couldn't take it anymore, Yin was already panting like a cow, and the three female stars were even red-faced. At that time, Guizhou Road was crowded with people, making them afraid to go downstairs. So Yuan described in detail how Chen Yunshang had injured her foot while cutting the ribbon the other day, and Yin took the opportunity to ask Dr. Chen to examine his trachoma. Han said he was taking advantage, and the receptionist held four cigars and gave them to Yin. Yin didn't dare to keep them to himself, but handed them over to Han. Han put two cigars in Yin's suit pocket, and said he was decorating his appearance for him. As he was about to stuff the remaining two in his own pocket, Officer Hong suddenly came and said that his pocket was also empty and could hold cigarettes. Han then gave him one, and said that the street was crowded with people, did he pretend to be an ox when he came? These three people were used to performing together. More and more guests gathered, and Yin, being fat and afraid of heat, said that at this rate, he was afraid of suffering from heatstroke. Han said that all the medicines were ready, and if he suffered from heatstroke, he would not die, and everyone laughed. He then telegraphed to send police to disperse the idlers, and they went downstairs to cut the ribbon and then fled together.</p>
