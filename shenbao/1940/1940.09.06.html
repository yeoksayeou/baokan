<h3 id="c5">日本將用兵越南嗎？ <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>前昨頻傳：西貢與香港兩地接獲情報，日本方面定於九月六日，對法屬越南採取軍事行動。倘若所傳不訛，則今日便是遠東變局，乃至世界變局，另入新階段的開始。同時，各方報告與此有關的消息：（一）在越南海防口外，日艦麕集，兼具掩護登陸與封鎖海綫的兩種姿態；（一）在昆連越南的中國廣西邊境，日軍有越境入越的姿態；（一）法國當局關於日本要求借道侵華，以及在越南設置海空兩軍根據地，已經拒絕；（一）越南無綫電廣播宣稱定期鐵道交通，暫時停頓；（一）日本侵越的主力是海軍，而其海軍大臣吉田，素稱比較溫和持重，忽然稱病辭職；（一）越南內部有變亂之說，日本發蹤指使的第五縱隊，在越飛躍。倘若這些消息確鑿有據，更可顯明的烘托出來，今日越南，已成瞬息燃燒的焦點。觸發火燄的，或是東京，或是環伺越南的日本海陸將校士兵。倘若燃燒了，越南的遠近鄰居，將沒有一個存心幸災樂禍的，亦沒有一個悠然隔岸觀火的。但是，這也不是應該懊喪憂慮的事情。</p>
<p>無論是今日或明日，或是最近與較遠的將來，一切劇烈變化，皆非意外，皆不容預言。瘋在症太時髦了。對於瘋在者，旣無從體騐其次一步動作，則不問其有無其有無動作，如何動作，惟有鎮靜的戒備着。昨日華盛頓電訊，美國國務卿赫爾氏，溫爾文雅的聲稱：華盛頓刻正密切注視日本在遠東足以影響越南或東印度的每一行動；又稱，法屬越南的局勢，乃美國政府所認為重要的事：又稱，日本倘若確已向越南法國當局提出最後通牒，則美國與論勢將有不幸的反響。這是一個世俗的意思表示，未必無效；但求其效騐的確鑿，則與其溫爾文雅的如此云云，恐怕還不如直截了當的喝令止步，更不如伸出鐵腕來。</p>
<p>話得說回頭。日本瘋在的頂點，似乎已經過去了，現在也許正在疲乏甦省的岐途。假使在疲乏之中，不再來一次最後的瘋在，則對越南的軍事行動，至少在今明日是不會實現的。惟一的原因，事實上太疲乏了。在這一原因之外，若代他從旁加些理智的註解，一則他因自知疲乏而打定主意，在泥足尙未拔出中國的期間，絕對不再向他方面作何軍事行動。當然，無論在陸上或海上，陳列些隊伍，是可能的，却亦並非所謂軍事行動，二則對法國雖可趁火打刦，但近來維希政府所取不卑不亢的態度，暗示着他在患難之中，並不孤立，還有友邦；德法兩國間的一切，不必多說；英法兩國在整個遠東，好像以洋涇浜爲界，愛多亞路上的情况可以代表得；更有美國，即如赫爾氏昨日所表示的，誰也絕不懷疑於美國對越南有何野心，或想分肥，却祗爲了維護越南現狀。不久之前，亞洲方面聽得美國重申了美洲的門羅主義，德國呼喊了歐洲的希特勒主義，以爲他們關閉了自己的大門，束縛了自己的行動，拋却門外的一切了；這不是幼稚的誤解，便是利令智昏；但看今日越南問題的正反面，眞是重要的一課啊。三則日本固然明知德國在遠東無能爲力，故現在確是無須忌憚德國；明知最好追隨驥尾，却又迎合不上他的條件；然而要想在遠東做些不流血的買買，還得借重『吾友軸心』爲幌子；故就世界全局而論，似乎大有操縱其間的縱橫妙用，但越南問題所引起明的暗的反應，則不能無所顧忌於一朝肆意恣爲，不免跌在縱橫之間，而爲兩頭勿着的駝子。四則所謂新體制也者，還在袞袞羣公方寸之問，尙未全部搬到紙上；搬上了紙，一帆風順，也還得漸漸推行，慢慢收效；而其主旨，唯一的主旨，是結集消耗了三四年的殘餘力量，加速創造新力量，絕對不是羣策羣力，再放一把大火。來加速燬滅所殘餘。越南天賦極厚，但望虛張聲勢，不勞而獲。若果流血，徒見其瘋在。</p>

<h3 id="c32">歐戰叢談（一）　少年希特勒的潦倒 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>少年希特勒現在差不多一十三歲了。他飽經憂患，與貧苦奮鬭，漸漸的要苦盡甘來了。眞所爲天之欲降大任於此人，必先苦其心志，勞其筋骨，希特勒後來在他的著作中，也頗流露此意，不過他所認爲不滿而加以忿恨的，亦與日俱增。他潔身自好，淸凈爲懷的程度，比了幼時亦更見進步。住在小客棧裏的時候，他是出名不去找尋女人的。還有件事，其他的人往往在公共室中，當衆裸裎，不以爲恥。希特勒換玄服時，却要老遠躱到壁角落裏，偷偷摸摸，很覺不安，所以從來沒有人看見過他的身體的。他吃東西也很細緻，一方面因爲胃弱，一方面認爲肉食不潔足以亂性。他祇吃些蔬菜和粟粥。至於酒類，更是點滴不入。他兩眼巨大，水汪汪的熱情四溢？身子雖較瘦矮，頭部却被稱爲「美」得很。鼻下蓄着一撮小鬍子，走路時候，步子很輕快。</p>
<p>他在維也納市上東飄西蕩，常常自言自語。一有了錢便去看歌劇，這是他唯一的消遣。這時候他愛讀法國人哥畢諾伯爵所著立說離奇的「人種學」，贊成日耳曼主義。他並愛好瓦格　的音樂，他對於那些歌劇別有領會之處。在反對共產黨人和猶太人之外，他對於國會議員，和其他民治政府的官僚們，也很表示憎惡。他常到奧國衆議院去聽辯論，看見那些議員們多是混血兒，不是日耳曼種，不覺大爲憤懣。這時，在他自己的著作中，他曾很明顯的說明如何痛惡混血人種</p>
<p>二十三歲那年，希特勒離維也納往德國的慕尼黑。在那裏或是做做油漆匠或是做做裱畫司務的助手。這樣兩年之後，歐洲大戰爆發，他便投效德軍，初爲下士，後爲伍長，深爲上級所器重。他愛國情緒非常高，在同儕中說話亦獨多。長官利用他的熱情，專門叫他去擔仟單獨而危險的工作，像傳遞消息，和單獨斥堠之類。他曾受傷兩决，又被煤氣悶倒甚爲利害。戰爭期中，他把他母親的小照，放在胸前軍服左面口袋中。休假期間，他仍律身嚴謹，形同苦修。。這時他把鬍子剃光，只留着短髭。</p>
<p>希特勒一團中的上校，在開戰後不久便陣亡了。未幾，新派團長到任，他隨着大隊開赴前綫。忽然有幾顆子彈從上飛來，希特勒躍出行伍，把自己身子遮掩新團長，並且很勇敢的喊着，他不願在這樣短短的時間中，使第二位團長陣亡。」一同伴們對他這種姿態未免表示嫌怪。事後，他們揶揄着對他說，要是眞要救護團長，應該先把他推倒，使他平臥地上，然後把自己盍住他的身體，僅僅立在他面前是不中用的。但他們却承認他能做英雄，只是難與爲伍罷了。</p>
<p>他在軍隊之中，從不像其他士兵們常常口出怨言，對他的上級也從來不說短道長。他的言語行動全然不像一個兵；他常以光榮，愛國和爲國犧牲作口頭禪。然而有人却說他過於嘮叨。有一次，他到後方一個據點去，遇見一個兵士正在軍用電話機旁，有氣無力的講話。這兵士說，誰打勝仗，他一槪都不管。希特勒聽見此語，不覺火起，把他痛毆一頓，後來他還把這件事禀明上司，說他動火的原因，官長們倒還對他着實的獎勉一番。他對於長官們旣敬又誠，可說無微不至。一天他同一位弟兄被德國重砲的爆發聲震倒在泥澤，連氣都透不過來。他一次隻身捕獲幾個法國兵，榮膺一等鐵十字勛章。幾個年輕的副官想，這樣一個勇敢的士兵當可擢升爲尉官了，可是希特勒的頂頭上司說，「我決不叫這樣神經質的人升任軍官。」</p>
<p>一次，希特勒受了傷從醫院裏寫信給團長說：「請立刻召我回營。弟兄們正在攻擊敵人的時候，我不欲留在慕尼黑」。他傷愈歸隊，仍舊擔任伍長。他看戰事與他個人奮鬥一樣。德國戰敗，不啻他自己戰敗，這是從他有生以來，不能成爲藝術家而變爲流浪者後唯一痛心之事。休戰消息到達之時，他正第二次入醫院療傷，他身臥吊床，把頭攢在枕下，流淚哭泣。最後他仍把德國戰敗原因歸咎於共產黨及猶太人，這樣，纔覺得胸中寬舒了些</p>
<p>停戰條的簽字之日，希特勒已是二十九歲的人了。他比了那些歷史上自許爲世界征服者的，倒還要成熟些。在實際上，希特勒雖以此自許，而眞正發動這「大事」之日，却遲至五十歲之時。在個性上，這時期的他有許多地方和亞立山大一世，成吉思汁，穆罕默德，愷撒，威廉一世，及拿破侖頗有相仿之處。在工具和準備方面，更有若干地方比他們還强。他孑然一身，沒有家室之累；無家庭，無朋友，也不想和女人談戀愛。至於他的不喝酒，又是大衆曉喩的。他這樣的跡近苦修，在他肉體表面上，蒙了神秘的色彩。他自有一種强有力的潛在能力，幾經磨練發展，能把所受的痛苦，變爲勝利之夢。這個信念而且愈久愈難動搖。他博覽羣籍，頗具辯才、他所提出來的原理，總要引經據典，自圓其說。他有兩個純潔的夢境，一是追念他的母親，一是實現大德意志的觀念。他如果愛上任何東西，最後的歸納都逃不出這兩頃。外表上，他並不如何動人，然而內在的力量却非常叫人生出深刻的印象。這與過去一班自許爲世界的征服者的實有相仿之處。他們的「種一相同，而且都是生有異「禀的。幼時災殃備受，悶鬱不樂，甚至煩惱騷動，妄作妄爲及長，不是好色如命，任性汚亂，便是在性的方面，異常怪僻。</p>
<p>一九一九年，希特勒奉長官之命，前往慕尼黑，參加一個反猶太，反資本主義，反共產，反任何主義的一個集會，探刺他們的行動。這一個小小的團體，另有獨特的政治主張，想用新方法來拯救戰敗的德國。他們主張德國須有一個領袖人物希特勒，具有灰色水在汪的兩隻大眼睛，一撮頭髮覆在前額，短短的鬍子，柔荑般的雙手，和內在的神經質，猙獰坐在那裏，以自許爲征服世界者的姿態，側耳傾聽。第二次他又去參加，這一次不是奉了上級的命令，因爲陸軍已經不中用了，而是他自己去的，那次就當選爲這集會（按卽今日的國社黨）中的第七名委員。少年希特勒在一切失敗之餘，終於做了一個政治家了。</p>
<p>一九二三年，他領導叛變未成，被判入獄，在監獄裏寫了一部「我的奮鬥」，在那執政十五年前，已把各種征服世界的計劃寫在裏面，這也可說是「前無古人」的了。在獄一年又一個月後始被釋出。一九三二年由興登堡總統任命組閣，於是政權在握，排除異已，進而爲德國獨裁者。一九三九年，實現其征服歐洲的迷夢（本篇完）</p>

<h3 id="c72">糧食　國洋米價不顧限制　明目張膽俱做暗盤　國米有限價而不限…洋米有評價而不守　米市竟成黑暗世界…昨市又飛漲兩三元 <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>昨日洋米市況紊亂狀態中、僅有一般砶米及紅米尚有正市可言、開五十六　、其他各貨　成擯持局面、悉不出　、統做暗盤、雖自以秘密異常、但欲人不知、如非已莫為、昨有某客戶　檢舉業送工部局懲戒、但投機者　不畏法、後市雖若無形停頓、暗盤交易則仍形活潑、大有秘密公開之狀、一號西貢火絞均　至六十五六七元、一號及小絞至六十二三四元、市價竟至激漲兩三元、實銷只　本街鋪作之少數點綴而已、行客之心思交易與投機之吸收實占大半、在存充到湧之際、再以新米正　上市、米價之上漲、殊覺不近情理、但米商與投機者對於　縱壟斷依然狂熱、雖經工部局檢舉、而此風迄未稍已、原包英華司一號西貢越限一元半為七十三元之價開出暗盤後、續有七十四五元之喊價多方借以抬價口舌者乃以海防中斷與定價不符云云、實則滬市步漲後、定貨已將接近、至於交通迄今通運、來貨源源不絕、而暹緬兩路則始終無阻也、現米成交八千包、原包三百五十　、大半為囤戶收　云、</p>
<p>洋米繼續上漲、而亦繼續到滬、昨有華綸洋行經理之巴拿馬輪Essl號、直接由西貢裝來一萬六千一百十八包、昨晨七時許抵滬、停　法租界天文台碼頭起卸、儲入泰昌祥及法國郵船公司後新棧兩棧、又怡和洋行泰生輪、前日傍晚到滬、亦出香港運來三百包、在羅斯福碼頭起卸、聞滬越航綫卽將復航、貢米可源源而來、本市民食絕對無慮、（祖）</p>
<p>國米本來有限價、米商不遵守、取締之者莫可如何、佯不之理、因國米有限價、洋米無限價、故當時洋米之價步步上升、粳米之價暗盤飛騰、近來由米商公開評價之後、洋米要評價、原有限價之國米、現　越限、反可不評價、因之連日國米以不受評價拘束之故、暗盤公開飛漲、洋米亦做暗盤、當局亦無如之何、照此推論、將來國洋兩米、一則有限價而不限、一則有評價而不守、是誠如上海　孺所謂「滑稽來些」、而上海米市真可謂黑暗世界矣、</p>

<p>小麥　昨亦見昂挺、蓋自米價漲以來、貨主雖有堅持之心、終為環境束縛、不能運入租界、為日廠抑價收取、故市面無從發展、昨日一鑫廠吃盤已較寬放、送廠作價者、高檔廿一元至廿一元半、中次者仍為廿一元左右、華廠收進廿五元及廿四元八角、惟出口幫正式成交辦去之太倉麥一百五十二包、價已放至二十五元五角、此前驟漲半元云、</p>

<p>現紗晨開、市場人氣看好者無數、二十支雙馬價為一千〇二十五元、直漲至〇三十九元、此時搶帽子者一律拖進、乃造成上升之局面、詎料匯票轉升、黃金大跌、老多頭已在暗中逐步出籠、擡面上籌碼感覺充盈、市盤反漲為跌、低價跌至一千〇〇九元、查半日開成交統計二千三百八十包、收盤價為一千〇十四元半、比上日跌十六元、今日有紗一百一十件運烟台、茲將各幫口買去之額量分列如左、</p>

<p>現棉交易又復活動、惟多數廠方、在昔日高價時吸收奇旺、故存底仍充足、除一小部份廠商存貨較鮮、稍有採辦外、其他絕乏生色、不過同業心思交易轉趨活躍、所以行情緊昂</p>

<p>以上現貨送廠</p>
<p>另訊外棉布價、紐約棉布、日來呈堅定狀態、華爾街股票價格高漲、及一部份紡織廠購買亦活躍、結果收盤價格較之上日又漲五六磅音、印度昨日連同預測又漲四羅比餘</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨因紗價回疲、棉布亦稍有靜寂、昨成交雖屬寥寥、而訽問者頗多、同業心思亦高、</p>
<h3 id="c81">疋頭　布價微跌 <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>國布　昨市微軟、乃因實銷去路未暢、囤戶心神不定、黃金回跌、吐售之風又熾、變化殊形迅速、售盤粗布平平、細布斜紋每疋跌二角半之譜、漂染印花布價均平穩、本街成交粗細布斜紋絨布坯布漂染布三百餘件、浙閩幫辦當貴細布斜紋怡和粗布等貨一百餘件、粵港幫辦綸昌色布細布斜紋粗布二百餘件、北路烟台威海衛幫辦怡和等廠粗布百餘件、國外南洋幫辦卡其色漂布三千數百疋</p>
<p>東布　昨以外滙放長、標金下挫、白貨龍頭細布因市場浮多傾吐、回跌殊猛、上午收盤為三十三元、下午又降至三十二元七角半、四君子嗶嘰每碼九角三分二厘半、中檔細布每疋亦各跌五六角、</p>
<p>出口　疋頭今日有二百十五件、運往烟台、</p>
<h3 id="c82">雜糧　豆價俱昂 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>糧市況、除一部份少人問津之落令貨在疲憊情形外、其他內來源受嚴重箝制、故被強迫上漲、但交易出於不自然、生意因之大都小來小往、昨日黃豆蠶豆市價在惡劣之環境下、昂砌三四角、計安慶豆已開至三十三元至三十三元五角、桑園豆售三十四元至三十四元三角、崇明沙黃二十九元五七角、吳江青蠶（非揀青）二十一元二角至九角、北港毛家市青蠶二十元零一角、瀏河青蠶十九元二角至七角、平湖青蠶一十一元、安慶小粒白蠶十六元至十六元六角云、</p>

<p>昨糖市無甚更動交易亦稀、公會劃盤、現貨一四粗白外棧新貨叫七十九元、老貨六月份到貨叫七十八元、四月到貨七十七元半、均未成交、太古車白B嘜仍七十七元八角、DY嘜稍鬆、為七十四元至七十三元九角、HX嘜九月十五日打棧單七十四元至七十三元七角半、荷赤亦見軟、為六十三元半至六十三元三角、國糖以貨缺仍緊、新到東鄉赤七百外包、叫六十元、卽外產之冬霧青、聞有續到、叫升六七元、均未成交、查昨由香港來糖五百四十包、</p>

<p>烟煤生意、依然平淡無勁、實因本市存底充足、銷場未動、行情萬難昇騰、仍屬徘徊之象、日昨市場略有成交、計開印度喀爾喀答塊同業拆價仍喊二百元、飾塊二百零八元、棧房出貨、行積外加、</p>

<p>漳州所產之蘭竹枝、因鼓浪嶼間之船隻尚未暢通、首批貨僅到數十箱、又以外費甚昂、故開盤特高、昨號方已開出由各行分通、行盤定售二百三十元、僅有薄利云、</p>

<p>本埠之蘇州河，卽吳淞江也，江口淤淺日久，潮退時僅二三尺，不但往來船隻，行駛爲難，且於口內農田，灌漑不易，早經道憲札委上海縣及洋務委員，會同勘丈，所有港口至大橋之淤淺河道，擬用製造局機器開挖，估約四閱月可以竣工。一面將挖泥機器船隻等件，移怕港口，並雇定船夫駁運挖起淤泥；卽於本月初八日動工開挖，由奉派委員隨時督察，另派監工司事，常坐船認眞監督，以期迅速完工。從此船戶農夫，咸沾利益矣。</p>

<p>— 沙駝</p>
<p>本月三日本報「本埠新聞」欄內，刊有菲島僑胞李萍影先生給本報編輯先生的一封公開信，李先生雖然自謙「在這封信里頭，雖然沒有精彩的文字，和超絕的理論」，然而我讀了李先生那封「公開信」後，非常感動，李先生的那封「公開信」，的確如他所說，是「每一個字句的造作，却是我的辛酸眼淚的結晶啊！</p>
<p>作爲一個僑胞的李先生，能够這樣關懷於祖國的一切，在這孤島也可算是「僑居」的我，實在對李先生是無限的敬佩，同時，醉生夢死於這孤島上的我們萬千同胞，應該怎樣猛然憬悟過來。——我們是都該讀一讀李先生的那一封「公開信」的！</p>
<p>李先生是數日前由遙遠的南洋投到祖國的懷抱里來的，他是久慕着上海的偉大，繁榮，因此時時想一瞻上海的　儀，來慰他生平的志願。可是李先生當一踏到上海，上海所給予李先生的，是：</p>
<p>舞女野雞多於黃浦江之鯽；還有：嚮導，堂子，鹹肉莊；還有：酒店舞廳；還有：綁票，暗殺；還有：路有「凍死」之骨；……這些一切，使李先生對上海的印象，立刻有了一個急速的轉變，那就是——魔窟！</p>
<p>因此李先生要明天就離開這「魔窟」，到內地去，因爲李先生厭惡着上海的一切，更詛咒着上海的同胞，所以才不願再在這「魔窟」中久留！我相信：李先生到了內地，那末，他對祖國的失望，一定會重新恢復起來的，並且相信，祖國正在年靑，向新的大道上邁進哩。</p>
<p>李先生那封「公開信」，旣是「公開」的，顯然，不是僅只給本報編輯先生一個人的了，因此，作爲一個中華同胞的我，對李先生那封「公開信」，很想向李先生作一番解釋。</p>
<p>第一：上海已是淪陷之地了，所謂孤島」的名稱，就是由此而來的。因此李先生到上海這「魔窟」來，實在不是投向「祖國來。這一點，我覺得很是重要，因爲李先生是「僑胞」，李先生的「公開信」，對一僑胞」的影響一定是會很大的。因此連帶到——</p>
<p>第二：李先生所看到的一切，是現代資本主義社會的一大都市」所必然有的現象。嚮導，舞女，野鷄，鹹肉莊，綁票，堂子，（只有暗殺却是特有的現象），這些一切，在一切現代的「大都市」中，我們都可以找到的。李先生之所以找到這些罪惡的現象而悲憤的，我相信是李先生把上海看作「祖國」了，因此而覺得失望之至，這點，我在上面已經說到，其實是李先生自己說到的：上海僅是「魔窟」而已！</p>
<p>然而上海究不同於其他淪陷之地，我說以上那話，也愉不幫助一部分醉生夢死的人，那些人，我覺得應該把李先生的那封公開信放在案頭上，作爲「座右之銘」的。不過在這里，我只有一句話奉吿李先生以及國外一切「僑胞」的，那就是：「一面是荒淫無恥，一面卻是嚴肅的工作」呵！在上海滯留一星期的李先生，是沒法看到的吧！</p>
<p>現在，李先生是離開上海而去內地了，我想對，李先生在上海所得到的那些不快的印象，在內地是沒有的，因此李先生也會確信：把「來到上海」而富作「投向祖國」的懷抱，實在是錯誤的了！</p>
<p>同時，我希望全上海的同胞們，都應一讀李先生那封「公開信」，有則改之，無則加勉，李先生雖然「詛咒着上海的同胞」，然而這是李先生的「憤語」，我們應該感謝李先生，因爲他的那封「公開信」，在這濁氣混沌的大上海，不啻是一顆五百磅的大炸彈！</p>

<p>第六章　危險的經歷</p>
<p>我又問道：「那末，你從亞東出來以後，就直接到這裏來的嗎？」</p>
<p>霍桑道：不，我要知道你尾隨那余甘棠的成績怎樣，又料想你一定會疑惑我的突然失踪，所以我曾回我的寓所裏去。施桂把你們的經過情形告訴了我，所以我又趕到昌明里去，見過那個宋兆麒。」</p>
<p>我道：「宋兆麒？那個瘦長個子穿一件淡藍白條紋西裝襯衫的傢伙嗎？」</p>
<p>霍桑應道：「眞是他，。他是余甘棠的朋友，曾吿訴我不少關於余甘棠的話。不過他竭力給余甘棠辯白，說他在兇案上沒有關係。」</p>
<p>倪金壽忙問道：「你也相信嗎？他如果和這件兇案沒有關係，怎麼一句話都不肯說？」</p>
<p>霍桑答道：「我當然不會完全接受那宋兆麒的話。若說余甘棠不肯說話，那並不成什麼問題。不過眼前最急切的，就是怎樣把這個開槍的人我得來。」</p>
<p>我忽然有一種突然想起的見解。「霍桑，你想這開檢打你的人，會不會就是趙伯雄？他的個子也很高。」</p>
<p>霍桑把兩隻手抱住了他的右膝，眼睛瞧着地板，綏緩地答道：「這的確是可能的。可惜我始終沒有細瞧他的正面的機會。我正恨我自己太謹慎了。」</p>
<p>倪金壽道：「如果就是他，事情倒簡單些；否則另外又多了一個人出來，那就更麻煩了。」</p>
<p>霍桑道：「我猜想那決不是另生的枝節。開槍的卽使不是趙伯雄本人，一定也是屬於他這一條綫。你用不着過慮的。」</p>
<p>倪金壽道：「那末，你打算用什麼方法去找這趙伯雄？」</p>
<p>霍桑攢着眉毛，答道：「這不能不借重你們官廳的力。第一步，你須憑着公務員的名義，跟那旅館裏的負責人去接洽一下，然後才能向各部份的茶房仔細調査。如果事情還有曲折，我們一時不能下手，第二步你還須派幾個得力的探員，裝扮了茶房，在那邊小心守候。」　（九八）</p>
<h3 id="c93">金魚的幸運？ <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— 李馥</p>
<p>在一只闊口的玻璃缸中，能有三四條金黃的和烏黑的金魚，睜着一對暴突出頭外的眼珠，擺着那闊大而開又的尾巴，悠閑地在一莖碧綠的水草中穿來穿去，借着水光的反映，更顯得色彩的鮮艶，使任何人見了，都不由地對之生出一種好感。所以，不但高貴華麗的廳堂裏需要牠的點綴，就是普通人家以及小孩的瓦鉢，磁盌裏，也有牠們的蹤跡，甚至一般窮苦階級，沒有將牠們請回家去的能力，在路旁遇上了賣金魚的攤子，也會竚立着儘量的觀賞。</p>
<p>在動物學上和日常的傳說上都這樣地說，金魚是鱒魚的變種。可是我沒有見過怎樣變的，更不知道是怎樣變的了；不過，想來總是用了像從前女人纏足那樣殘忍的方法，將牠們造成這樣的一對怪眼和一條不善游泳的闊尾，雖然姿勢是婀娜了，模樣是美麗了，更能使人一見生愛，而牠們天賦的技能却剝削殆盡了。假如牠們並不受人們的保護，寄生在玻璃缸或荷花池中，想用牠們怯弱細小的身軀在自然界中自求生存，金魚柏早已像恐龍等一樣，成爲歷史上的名詞了。</p>
<p>所以，金魚雖在先天受了摧殘，因之技能上有了缺陷，才得到人們的愛護，才能自由自在地不用費一絲心力在牠們的小世界中生活着，並不用在驚風駭浪中担怕受嚇，而且還可對其他魚類驕傲說：「你們有誰像我能生登大雅之堂！</p>
<p>這是金魚之幸，還是不幸呢？</p>

<p>是臨時演員們的副業</p>
<p>世界上大概有不少的女子，她們以爲好萊塢是理想的樂園，一到那邊每一個人都立刻可以成爲明星的。所以每年不知道有多少美貌的女子往好萊塢去，但是結果她們全都失望了！她們美麗的夢成爲泡影，只有少數的女子得到了一個吃不飽餓不死的臨時演員地位。因爲她們臨時演員的收入不够糊口，她們近來想出了一種副業，那就是「弄棍」。「弄棍」的把戲我們也時常可以在電影巾見到，那就是地個人把一根棍子在身邊前後左右的轉着，做出各種美妙的姿態。她們現在組織了一個團體，每人有一種奇特的服裝，她們一方面可以在影片中歌舞塲而裏或游行塲面裏演出，一方面又可以受廣告公司或宣傳公司的雇用來賺錢。現在這種「弄棍」的把戲已經風行一時，差不多每一個好萊塢女子都在學着，不久或將成爲一種時髦的運動工具哩！</p>

<p>關於「李香君」的解釋</p>
<p>舞台劇「李香君」上月會在　宮演出，該劇現已由金星攝爲影片，排定本月十二日在金城上映。這里是訪問劇作者的談話。</p>
<p>第一個問題——</p>
<p>（問）怎樣去寫「李香君」及其動機？</p>
<p>（答）我怎麼寫「李香君」的呢？由於桃花扇這一些題材，在今天看來：</p>
<p>（一）時代雖有不同，環境恰有相似之處；</p>
<p>（二）材料過多，處理上不能不選揮要點，同時，與其寫大人先生們，不如寫平民階級，所以題材偏重李香君個人部份。</p>
<p>（三）處理材料之前，我曾先就桃花扇本身作了通盤硏究，（包括史實考證，排塲分配以及人物個別描寫），之後才開始寫的。</p>
<p>（四）主題是妓女尙講究氣節，侯朝宗却妥協投降。借離合之情，寫興亡之感。</p>
<p>第二個問題——</p>
<p>（問）舞台和電影有怎樣不同的地方？</p>
<p>（答）舞台上分幕和人物上下塲要受限制，取材不免使前後事實不能不在時間上作縮短的寫法，就是說，爲使前後貫串，不能不求其牽合。</p>
<p>（二）電影方面，不受空間限制，在舞台上未能明白表現處，在電影上可以明寫或另自穿揷，換言之，電影是整個的，舞台是部份的。</p>
<p>（三）舞台上劇情進行，注重對白，電影則可以滲合畫面，使能面面俱到。</p>
<p>（四）因爲舞台劇有許多事實全靠對白予以交代，而電影則舉凡話劇所看不到的情節在銀幕上都能够有充分的表演</p>

<p>正是悶悶熱的一天下午，我經陸先生的介紹得往新華總廠去參觀攝片。那天第四攝影棚正在拍攝「瀟湘秋兩」，此片爲陳雲裳王元龍海熹等所主演，我們去時正在拍文遠家中一幕，　　（陳雲裳飾）拜認義父，此幕雲裳表演悲喜二種姿態，於旋踵間轉變，殊非易易，演來甚爲自然，殊覺難得。陳小姐嘗於此幕中有「我的父親，現在還不知在什麽地方，叫我怎能放心」？一句，陳小姐對「心」字，國音欠準，，後經指導後，雖略校正，終嫌勉强。</p>
<p>本來接下去尙須拍一幕，後因梅　未到，不得已而停拍我們也就從第四攝影塲退了出來。</p>
<p>從第四攝影棚到了第一攝影棚，中間隔着一段路，路的雨旁，全都搭了假屋布莊，酒店，客棧，色色俱全，正面觀之，頗為逼真，自後觀之，一根根橫七豎八的小木段，不知其為何物，見此情景，不覺啞然失笑。</p>
<p>第一攝影棚裏，正在拍顧蘭君主演之「刁劉氏」佈景爲刁劉氏的　房裏，床前珠　明窗，窗下置琴，琴旁焚香一爐，烟縷縷淸香，頗極幽靜。顧蘭君飾刁劉氏，正演調琴，被屋外某所聞，贊聲連連，想此幕定爲調情之先聲，演下去「風光一定必「旑旎」，惜無眼福，未能見之耳。此劇導演者爲馬徐維邦，矮小精悍，絲毫不苟，想刁劉氏獻映時必將轟動全滬也。時已近晚，乃雇車而歸</p>

<h3 id="e1">U.S. Note to Japan: Close Attention to New Situation in the Far East; Possible Joint Front for British and American Navies; Japanese Government to Issue Formal Statement on Vietnam Situation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Washington: The United States yesterday publicly notified Japan that Washington will pay close attention to all Japanese actions in the Far East that could affect Annam and the East Indies. At the same time, Secretary of State Hull revealed that the United States still refuses to recognize the Japanese takeover of the British defense zone in Shanghai (i.e., the one evacuated by British forces last month). Hull said that U.S.-Japan negotiations on the aforementioned issue are still ongoing, but have not yet reached the point of any agreement. It is reported that Hull warned Japan earlier this summer, stating that the United States opposes any attempts to change the situation in the Far East by force. According to unconfirmed reports from here yesterday, Japan's request to transport troops through Annam territory was rejected. It is said that Japan has notified the French authorities in Annam that Japanese troops will arrive in the French colony early tomorrow. As for what action the United States will take if the integrity of Annam's territory is violated by Japanese forces, Hull did not say. Hull issued a statement saying that the situation in French Annam "is an event that the US government is paying attention to." The US has not confirmed the reports that Japan sent an ultimatum to the French authorities in Annam, and fundamentally considers the report to be unbelievable. The statement continued that if future events prove that the aforementioned report is not without basis, the impact on American public opinion will be unimaginable." (Fifth, United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Asahi Shimbun today published an editorial speculating that the British and American navies may take a common front against Japan. The article stated that if Germany wins the war against Britain, the British fleet will inevitably withdraw from the domestic waters, and the situation in the Far East will be affected. Yomiuri Shimbun stated that Britain urgently needs any assistance it can get to resist the German offensive, so it is well aware that the American destroyers are already old, but it is still willing to lower its dignity before the United States. These fifty destroyers are part of the two hundred ships that the United States hurriedly built during the last World War, of which 30% are no longer seaworthy. A few years ago, Congress investigated this matter. Britain's move is indeed strange, but Britain's purpose goes far beyond obtaining these destroyers. Its purpose is to gradually pull the United States closer to war, and to shock its enemies spiritually, and to encourage and excite its own people. How Britain and the United States can continue to do this is none of our business, but the possibility of the compromise between Britain and the United States in the Atlantic extending to the Pacific is worth asking. The newspaper cited the joint management of Canton and Enderbury Islands by Britain and the United States as proof, and also cited the recent remarks of retired US Navy officer and former commander of the US Yangtze River Patrol Gunboat Fleet, Rear Admiral Stirling F. Smith, and the American publisher, Howard, who emphasized that if the United States goes to war with Japan, its navy must use the Singapore naval base. The newspaper concluded by saying that after the failure of Britain's Far East policy, it agreed to block the Burma Road and has now placed its Far East interests under the protection of the United States. Although Britain and the United States have not reached a compromise on the Pacific, who dares to predict what will happen tomorrow? This is why Japan should pay attention to it.

<h3 id="e2">Hull Opposes Japanese Invasion of Vietnam, Unanimous Approval from U.S. Lawmakers <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Washington: American congressional foreign relations experts recently unanimously approved Secretary of State Hull's statement opposing the invasion of Vietnam. New York Republican Congressman and member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Fish, indirectly praised the statement, saying that the content and meaning of this statement are very peaceful, while other lawmakers believe that this statement has far-reaching significance. California Democratic Congressman Isac said that this is clearly a warning to Japan, and Isac predicted that after the United States issued this warning, unless Japan believes that Germany has indeed defeated Britain, it will never invade Vietnam. (Fifth, United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma, who told newly arrived reporters today that the Foreign Ministry has not received detailed reports on the Vietnam negotiations, but General Nishihara has considerable discretion in conducting talks. The spokesman is aware of the impression abroad that Japan's ultimatum has been issued, but believes that this is quite questionable. The spokesman also said that the Japanese government will issue a formal statement on the situation in Vietnam in the coming days. Newspapers believe that the British-American agreement makes it more urgent for Japan to realize its goals for French Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies. Kokumin Shimbun said that the British-American compromise in the Atlantic has made the relationship between Britain and the United States in the Pacific closer, so Japan's policy towards Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies is even more important. Asahi Shimbun said that Britain and the United States have agreed to allow the US fleet to stay in the Pacific, so the United States' preparation to consolidate its backyard—the defense of the Pacific—is now clearly visible. (Fifth, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry recently stated that French-Japanese negotiations are still underway in Vietnam, and there are no new developments to report, but also said that Major General Nishihara, the leader of the Japanese monitoring group in Vietnam, has reportedly been authorized to act at will. An army spokesman said that there have been no reports here of the alleged "deadline" set by the Japanese side in the hope of obtaining a reply to their demands. (Fifth, United Press Dispatch)</p>

<p>Tokyo: According to the "Hochi Shimbun", the opinion of Japanese aviation expert Mutō is that even if the United States and Japan go to war, the strength of the Japanese Navy is sufficient to avoid an American aerial blitzkrieg. Mutō believes that American aviators will not be able to break through the Japanese naval defense line. When discussing air defense in the event of war, Mutō said, "If Japan is forced to take military action against the United States, it will not be easy for the United States to bomb Japan, as Germany bombed Britain. Japan's airspace will never be filled with American aircraft. Another certainty is that the strength of the Japanese Navy is sufficient to prevent the US Navy from sailing past the 120th meridian in the Pacific. The Japanese Navy is indeed confident in this move. If war breaks out with the United States, Japan will deploy a 2,000-mile-long ring in the Pacific. The United States has no way to break through this. The United States may be able to let three or four aircraft slip into Japanese territory, but this number cannot be used for large-scale bombing. The US mainland is too far from Japan. Some people may think that the United States can use Hong Kong as a base to bomb Japan, but this is absolutely impossible. No one believes that Hong Kong will still exist as usual when the United States and Japan go to war. If the United States insists on launching a large-scale air raid on Japan, the only way is to abandon its aircraft fleet and move it as close to Japan as possible, but can the US ships really get close to Japan? However, there is an exception to this. If Britain flees to Canada with its 200 warships and places full naval authority in the hands of the Americans, it may be able to do something to Japan, but this is still very far from now. Although, if this matter involves the Soviet Union, Japan will be in great danger. If the Soviet Union goes to war with Japan, they can send planes from Korea to Japan in just two hours. Therefore, Japan must pay attention to this matter. However, if Vladivostok is destroyed before the Soviet Union acts, there is nothing to fear. Therefore, 'first come, first served is an invaluable path'." (Fifth, United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>New York: Former Commander-in-Chief of the US China Fleet, Rear Admiral Yarnell, recently spoke to a New York correspondent, praising President Roosevelt's actions in concluding the British-American naval treaty and urging the British and American fleets to unite immediately, saying that this would defeat the Nazis and Japan, but time is of the essence. The reporter asked if there were any British bases in the Pacific under the same treaty that could be used by the United States. He said that the United States needs Singapore.

<p>Tokyo: Asahi Shimbun reported that, according to a New York Times Washington dispatch, the United States and Australia are currently conducting informal negotiations in accordance with the recent compromise between Canada and the United States. This matter is very noteworthy. Asahi Shimbun also speculated on the possibility of Germany winning the war against Britain, saying that Japan should prevent India, Malaya, and Australia from remaining under British control for a long time. A portion of the British fleet may move to the Far East. If so, the importance of Singapore as a naval base will inevitably increase. This is only natural. (Fifth, Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e5">Will Japan Use Force Against Vietnam? <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Frequent reports over the past few days indicate that Saigon and Hong Kong have received intelligence that Japan is set to take military action against French Vietnam on September 6th. If these reports are accurate, then today marks the beginning of a new stage in the Far Eastern situation, and even the world situation. At the same time, various reports provide related information: (1) Japanese warships are massing outside Haiphong harbor in Vietnam, posing both a landing cover and a naval blockade; (2) Japanese troops have positioned themselves to cross the border from China's Guangxi Province into Vietnam near Kunlun Pass; (3) French authorities have rejected Japanese demands to transit troops through China and establish naval and air bases in Vietnam; (4) Vietnamese radio broadcasts announced the temporary suspension of scheduled rail transport; (5) The main force of the Japanese invasion of Vietnam is the navy, and its Naval Minister, Yoshida, known for being relatively moderate and prudent, has suddenly resigned due to illness; (6) There are rumors of internal unrest in Vietnam, with the Japanese-instigated fifth column actively in motion. If these reports are verified, they further illuminate the fact that Vietnam has become a burning focal point. The flame may be ignited by Tokyo, or by Japanese army and navy officers and soldiers surrounding Vietnam. If it burns, none of Vietnam's neighbors will be gleefully schadenfreude, nor will any nonchalantly watch the fire from across the river. However, this is not something to be despondent and worried about.</p>
<p>Whether today or tomorrow, or in the near or distant future, all drastic changes are not unexpected and cannot be predicted. Madness is too fashionable. For those who are mad, there is no way to anticipate their next move, so regardless of whether they move, or how they move, we can only calmly be prepared. Yesterday, a Washington dispatch reported that U.S. Secretary of State Hull made a mild and cultured statement: Washington is closely watching every action by Japan in the Far East that could affect Vietnam or the East Indies; the situation in French Vietnam is a matter the US government deems important; if Japan has indeed issued an ultimatum to the French authorities in Vietnam, there will be unfortunate repercussions in American public opinion. This is a secular expression of intention, and may not be ineffective. However, for its effectiveness to be certain, perhaps it would be better to issue a direct order to stop, or to extend an iron fist, rather than saying so mildly and culturedly.</p>
<p>But let's backtrack. The peak of Japan's madness seems to have passed, and it may now be at a crossroads of fatigue and awakening. If, during its fatigue, it does not experience one last surge of madness, then military action against Vietnam will not be realized, at least in the next day or two. The only reason is that it is factually too exhausted. Beyond this reason, if we add some rational commentary on its behalf, one is that it has decided, knowing its own exhaustion, that it will absolutely not take any further military action in other directions while its feet are still stuck in China. Of course, it is possible to deploy some troops on land or sea, but that is not what is meant by military action. Second, although France can be exploited in its distress, the non-humiliating and non-arrogant attitude recently adopted by the Vichy government suggests that it is not isolated in its difficulties, and that it has allies; there is no need to say more about the relationship between Germany and France; in the entire Far East, Britain and France seem to be separated by the Yangjingbang, and the situation on Edward Road can be representative of that; and then there is the United States, as Secretary Hull indicated yesterday, no one doubts that the United States has any ambition for Vietnam, or wants to divide the spoils, but only to maintain the status quo in Vietnam. Not long ago, the Asian side heard the United States reiterate the Monroe Doctrine in the Americas and Germany shout out Hitlerism in Europe, believing that they had closed their own doors, bound their own actions, and abandoned everything outside the door; this was either a naive misunderstanding or a loss of reason due to greed; but looking at the pros and cons of the Vietnam issue today, it is truly an important lesson. Third, Japan knows full well that Germany is powerless in the Far East, so there is no need to fear Germany now; it knows that it is best to follow in its footsteps, but it cannot meet its conditions; however, if it wants to do some bloodless business in the Far East, it still has to rely on "Our Friend, the Axis" as a facade; therefore, from a global perspective, it seems to have great manipulative skills, but the overt and covert reactions caused by the Vietnam issue cannot be ignored in a moment of wanton arbitrariness, lest it fall between the vertical and horizontal lines, and become a hunchback with nothing on either end. Fourth, the so-called New Order is still a matter of debate among the public, and has not yet been fully put on paper; even if it is put on paper and goes smoothly, it will still have to be gradually implemented and slowly take effect; and its main purpose, the only purpose, is to gather the remaining strength that has been consumed for three or four years and accelerate the creation of new strength, and it is definitely not to pool efforts and put another big fire to accelerate the destruction of what remains. Vietnam is richly endowed, but hopes to make a show of force and gain without labor. If it sheds blood, it will only show its madness.</p>

<p>Hong Kong: According to news from Kwangchowan, Japanese residents and the Japanese inspection team in Vietnam were initially ordered to leave the country yesterday, but have now been ordered to stay, but are still ordered to prepare to leave Vietnam at any time. Little direct news has come in, and all communications are subject to strict inspection. Japan has changed its attitude, and the tense situation has eased slightly, but it is said that French nationals are still evacuating the coastal areas of Vietnam, and the authorities are still engaging in defense. Admiral Decoux, the Governor-General of Vietnam, met with Japanese officials again yesterday, but the progress of the meeting has not been disclosed. However, according to unconfirmed reports, the purpose of the Japanese officials is to persuade the Vietnamese Governor to recognize a certain agreement reached between the Japanese representative in France and the Vichy government.

<p>Hong Kong: The ban imposed by Hong Kong authorities three weeks ago on all American and Allied ships sailing to Vietnam was suddenly lifted this morning.

<p>Hong Kong: Major General Grasett, Commander of the British Forces in Hong Kong, told seven American reporters who visited the defenses yesterday that Britain's policy is to defend Hong Kong to the end. After describing Hong Kong's defensive situation and its ability to repel a major attack, Grasett said that Hong Kong has now become a difficult place to attack, and its current position is purely defensive. Grasett also said that Britain's policy at this time is to maintain the main bases and abandon the non-essential lands. This policy has been demonstrated by the British withdrawal from British Moulmein. We must not allow Hong Kong to fall into enemy hands. Although the enemy may use a blockade to attack Hong Kong, the British Navy will be able to take effective action to deal with it. (Fifth, United Press Dispatch)</p>

(Fifth, United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The English-language "Chu Pao" published an editorial titled "China's Interests in the South China Sea," stating that China is concerned about Japan's southward expansion, not only for strategic reasons, but also because it has important interests in the South China Sea. For centuries, Chinese people from the southern provinces of China have lived in various countries in the southern part of the South China Sea, and have created an economic territory. The remittances from overseas Chinese, especially those in the South China Sea, have become an important source of invisible income for the Chinese treasury, and have greatly contributed to the prosperity of the Min and Guangdong provinces. Many countries in South Asia have had long and close historical relations with China, such as French Vietnam, Burma, Thailand, the Malay Archipelago, the Straits Settlements, the Dutch East Indies, Borneo, and the Philippines. Annam was conquered by China in 214 BC. Although France forced China to give up its sovereignty over Annam in the mid-19th century, the Chinese have a strong influence in the national life of the country due to its long association with China. Chinese account for 400,000 of the 20 million residents, and most of them live in Cochinchina, where almost all industries and businesses are run by Chinese. Cholon (translated from Vietnamese), four miles from Saigon, is the center of trade for Chinese people in Vietnam. China also has similar interests in the Dutch East Indies. The tobacco plantations on the east coast of Sumatra employ more than 20,000 Chinese laborers, and the tin mines in Bangka Belitung employ several thousand Chinese laborers. All the towns in Borneo have Chinese residents who have lived there for generations, and most of the commerce is controlled by them. We can also list similar interests of Chinese people in other parts of the South China Sea. Therefore, if Japan can demand special interests in these places, then China has even more reason to demand them. As for French Vietnam, if the lives and property of the Chinese people there are threatened by the Japanese, China will not hesitate to protect them with force. China is also prepared to cooperate with the relevant powers in other parts of the South China Sea to curb Japan's ambitions. (Fifth, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: A Chinese military spokesman said that the Chinese army is prepared to enter Vietnam once Japanese troops land in Vietnam. The spokesman also believes that Major General Nishihara's ultimatum to Vietnam is a kind of intimidation, "because Japan believes that it can force the French to submit without relying on actual military action." The spokesman continued that if Japan concentrates a large army in Vietnam or confirms that its actions have diplomatic support, it may launch a war in Vietnam, but a force of one or two divisions is unlikely to be up to the task.

<p>San Francisco: Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox announced here yesterday that the United States is proceeding to lease the two Pacific islands of "Canal Peagas" and "Cocos" to further strengthen the defense of the Western Hemisphere. Colonel Knox stated that the United States should make the Panama Canal militarily impregnable, so the government should build more naval bases, as the canal cannot be fully protected solely by airplanes based in the country. After obtaining British consent, the United States exchanged 50 overage destroyers for 99-year leases of British bases in the Western Hemisphere. Since the establishment of this agreement, the United States has obtained the Atlantic gateway to the Panama Canal. If the lease of "Canal Peagas" and "Cocos" is established, the Pacific gateway to the Panama Canal can also be protected without worry. Colonel Knox arrived here yesterday to inspect the naval bases in the Pacific. He will fly to Hawaii to inspect Pearl Harbor. Afterwards, he may continue to inspect the U.S. bases on the Pacific islands of Washington, Oregon, and Alaska. (Associated Press dispatch of the 5th)</p>
<p>The United States Will Allocate Huge Sums to Build Bases</p>
<p>Salt Lake City: Secretary of the Navy Knox told reporters here last night that the United States will soon allocate $250 million to prepare for the construction of naval and air bases on land obtained from Britain. This exchange will surely cause a great uproar and will encounter the huge opposition encountered by the draft law during the last Great War, but Congress is aware of the trend of public opinion. He denied that the new British-American agreement had forced the United States to welcome war. He claimed that if Hitler sought an excuse to declare war on the United States, he could have long ago found a reason to declare war. When the House of Representatives met in Washington yesterday afternoon, members either called the transfer of destroyers "clearly an act of war" or said "this move is good." Opinions differed, and the debate was short, emotional, and inconclusive. Speaker Bankhead met with President Roosevelt before the meeting and told reporters that the rumors in the newspapers that the United States was negotiating with the Netherlands or Togo for bases in the West Indies were castles in the air and that there were no plans to seek more bases at present.

Although the first year of the World War had unprecedented sacrifices, the war gains obtained only accounted for a part of the current war gains. The achievements of the last twelve months can be</p>
<p>represented by a triangle. The triangle currently occupied by the German army extends east to the Bug River, north to Narvik and the North Cape, and south to the Spanish border. Britain only relied on the advantages of its geographical location to make a quick escape, avoiding the fate of immediate collapse. The British army had contact with the German army and had many opportunities to fight, but the British army quietly withdrew. Italy, as Germany's ally, took the offensive in East Africa, defeating the British army and strengthening Italy's position. British propaganda has turned German victories into British victories, and these "victories" cannot be understood by people with sound minds. Mr. Hitler gave examples to prove this. After the Allied forces were defeated in Norway and forced to withdraw, they declared that they hoped to withdraw from Norway. After the collapse of France, Britain declared that it could concentrate its forces and wage a more effective war against Germany. When the European war broke out, Britain expected the war to last for two years. Mr. Hitler declared that he had told Goering at the time,</p>
<p>to prepare for a five-year war. This preparation was not because the war might last five years, or because he believed the war would last five years, but as a precaution. Mr. Hitler solemnly declared that he knew that the end of the war was the collapse of Britain, and that the collapse of Britain would certainly become a reality. Germany has made meticulous preparations. Mr. Hitler declared that,</p>
<p>the world needs freedom, and one country must not blockade a continent, nor must one country make 540,000,000 people fall into the abyss of poverty. We cannot tolerate Britain dictating our work or dictating whether we can drink coffee. It is an intolerable situation if 85,000,000 people are punished only because of the decisions of London financiers. Mr. Hitler continued, stating that Germany was prepared to join hands with Britain, and understanding with Britain was the goal of German foreign policy. He is still willing to achieve a clear decision, the meaning of which is to remove the</p>
<p>pro-war government and build an environment in Europe that is not threatened by any country. Germany and Italy will never allow any country to threaten the whole of Europe again. Britain and its collapsed allies will not be able to stop Germany and Italy from achieving their goals. We are closely watching their conspiracies, we are prepared to act at any time, we are not afraid of any threats, the National Socialist Party has experienced the most difficult times and will not be intimidated by any situation. Britain predicted "revolution" and "famine", we will answer with "action" when the time is ripe. Mr. Hitler expressed his sincere thanks to the German Air Force. Currently, German planes are fighting against Britain every day. Mr. Hitler also thanked the people in the rear, and mentioned that 700,000 residents who were evacuated from the German border to the interior when the European war broke out acted resolutely and fearlessly. The British Air Force has recently raided Germany at night and indiscriminately bombed civilians because it cannot attack Germany during the day, because the German air defense forces will intercept them. Germany has not responded to British air raids for three months, which Churchill regards as a sign of weakness. Currently, German planes have been</p>
<p>attacking Britain at night and are increasing the extent of their bombing. If the British Air Force drops thousands of kilograms of bombs every night, the German Air Force will drop hundreds of thousands of kilograms of bombs every night. If British planes carry out heavy bombing of German cities, German planes will also destroy British cities. One of Britain and Germany will perish in the war, and the one that collapses will not be National Socialist Germany. Mr. Hitler continued, stating that Germany</p>
<p>must fight to the end, and the prerequisite is the united solidarity of the people. Without a people determined to fight, German soldiers will not be able to achieve the current war gains. The current purpose of the war is not the victory of the war, but the construction of a new country. The achievements of National Socialism are social reforms, which are feared by Jews and financiers. However, the future world will continue to develop along this path, and countries that cannot follow this path will collapse. The current war is a war to build the social foundation of Germany. The winter relief work during the war is a powerful manifestation of building spirit and a great educator's work. The achievements of recent years have shown a great victory. Future life will be more and more pleasant. Mr. Hitler finally thanked the workers of the first year of the wartime winter relief and</p>
<p>appealed to the German people to assist in the progress of the second year of the winter relief, hoping that the second year of the winter relief would once again show the world the inseparability of German society, so that all countries in the world would understand that expecting a "revolution" in Germany is in vain, and that the German people can all "do their duty together". National spirit will make Germany make a firm decision. The 85,000,000 people in Germany are truly a people with the same hearts, fighting shoulder to shoulder on the front lines with the same wishes and determination, which has created an unconquerable country. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 5th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German newspapers published yesterday morning on the front page with large headlines the speech delivered by leader Hitler in Berlin, guaranteeing that Britain will collapse. The "Berlin Financial Daily" commented, stating that if the British people cannot understand the faith that the German people place in the leader, then the leader's speech yesterday will surely enlighten the British people that Germany is a country with a sense of life and duty, vowing to eliminate Britain's maritime and aerial plundering, until the final decision. Germany's 85 million people have cleared Europe of enemies in a year. Germany will be able to give Britain the final blow when the time is chosen. The leader has a definite grasp of this.

<p>London: This morning, German bombers and fighters broke through the outer defenses of the southeast coast and flew towards the Thames River and London, but were repelled by fierce anti-aircraft fire and the machine gun fire of British fighters. Because the internal air defenses of London are tight, most of the German planes did not have time to drop bombs and flew back. A few German planes dropped several bombs in the suburbs. British planes pursued them until the coast. Today, German planes also raided the Midlands, Northwest, and Southwest regions. According to official claims, a large number of German planes flew over the southeast coast this morning, and some of them flew to the outskirts of London and dropped several bombs, but the reports received so far indicate that there was no major damage. British anti-aircraft positions and fighters inflicted heavy damage on the German planes. Fierce battles took place continuously during the air raid this morning, and three German Messerschmitts were shot down. (Reuters dispatch of the 5th)</p>
<p>Berlin: This morning, the targets of German bombers were the Hill and Cannes airfields. In the beginning, the British strength was weak and did not put up strong resistance. Afterwards, the number of British planes responding to the battle increased and there were multiple dogfights. Many British planes were shot down. The initial air raid alarm in London this morning lasted 50 minutes. (Haitong dispatch of the 5th)</p>

<p>Berlin: Regarding the British aircraft night raid on Berlin last night, the official gazette was issued here at dawn as follows: On the night of September 4th, British aircraft attacked Berlin at night. However, due to the dense German anti-aircraft fire, only a few aircraft entered Berlin's airspace after one enemy aircraft was shot down. Two heavy bombs were dropped. One fell on Tiertaden, killing one police officer on duty. The other fell on an ammunition depot in the northwest suburbs, but the damage was minimal. A workers' dormitory was also hit by a bomb, killing and injuring one worker each. (Haitong Telegraph, 5th)</p>
<p>London: The Air Ministry's Information Office stated that Berlin suffered its fifth attack in nine days on the night of the 3rd of this month. Military targets were repeatedly bombed by British aircraft. British aircraft repeatedly dived to attack a power station on the outskirts of Berlin. Although the low-hanging clouds obscured the details, many bombs were seen hitting the target area, and flashes of fire were seen. Another power station was bombed by British aircraft from an altitude of 7,500 feet. A gas plant was hit by a high-explosive bomb, immediately causing a large fire, and thick smoke rose like clouds. The second batch of attacking British aircraft bombed an arsenal, causing a deafening explosion. The light illuminated the low clouds, making them bright. The main railway lines on the outskirts of Berlin and the railway lines near the city were also bombed. Shortly after midnight, British aircraft dropped high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs on forested areas outside Berlin, such as the Grunewald Forest, with the aim of setting fire to the arsenals hidden in the forest. Two large fires immediately broke out in the forest north of the city. Fifteen minutes after the British aircraft flew away from the area, the crew turned their heads and looked back, still seeing the flames soaring upwards. After one British aircraft dropped a bomb on the Grunewald Forest, two explosions were seen 150 yards away, bright and yellow. Another batch of British aircraft that attacked at night concentrated on bombing the large Maqui Fort oil refinery and oil storage target area from southeast to northeast, causing fire and burning. One of the British aircraft sent to attack Maqui Fort hovered over the area for more than half an hour, searching for its target, but was eventually prevented by ground smoke and darkness. It then found the main railway intersection of the city and dropped a huge bomb. Arsenals and ammunition factories in the forests of northwestern Germany and the Habach Mountains were also attacked at night on the 3rd. This was the first time the area had been bombed. British aircraft dropped hundreds of incendiary bombs, and the surrounding pine forests caught fire and burned, the fire spread, and explosions rumbled. British aircraft were able to find the secret military targets they wanted to attack. One place was extremely hot, and it could still be seen from the air 70 miles away. (Reuters Telegram, 3rd)</p>

<p>London: Yesterday, a large squadron of German aircraft engaged in air combat with British aircraft. The intensity of the battle reached its peak, and the scope of the air combat was also extremely wide. After crossing the English Channel at dusk, German aircraft attacked the London area and several cities in southeastern England. The third air raid alarm of the day in London was issued on time amidst the explosions and the roar of anti-aircraft guns outside the capital. The last air raid by German aircraft began at 9:03 PM (Shanghai daylight saving time was 6:00 AM on Thursday) and lasted for one hour and thirty-seven minutes. The air raids and air battles on Wednesday lasted until late at night. The British side considers this battle to be a great victory, as 45 German aircraft were shot down in this battle, while the British warplanes only lost 11. (International News Agency Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>London: According to the latest report, the scope of last night's air raids was quite extensive. At least six German bombers attempting to break through London's defenses were shot down. After the air raid alert was lifted in the London area, searchlights still illuminated the sky. In a certain location in the southeast, 30 to 40 bombs fell within five minutes. Another German aircraft attempted to strafe the soldiers in charge of the searchlights with machine guns. Several high-explosive bombs fell in various rural areas of the Midlands. Houses were slightly damaged, and there were very few casualties. Two air raids occurred in the northeast area. A certain city on the coast of Wales and the southwest also experienced long periods of air raids. The garrison continued to repel the attacks with anti-aircraft fire. The damage caused by the bombs was very minor. (Reuters Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The official communiqué at 4:00 PM today stated that the first German Air Force unit attacked airfields in southern England, shot down 20 British fighter planes, and returned to its original defense safely. Only five were missing. (Haitong News Agency Telegram, 5th)</p>

According to sources from Raiskier on the west coast of Sweden, less than 300 people were rescued, and the number of drowned people is estimated to be over 3,000. It is said that a smaller troop transport ship was also sunk by torpedoes two weeks ago. (Reuters Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>London: The German Air Force once again attempted to break through the defenses of southeastern England and sneak into London yesterday, but failed. Forty-five aircraft were lost, including 35 bombers or fighter-bombers. The British side lost a total of 11 fighter planes, but it is reported that the pilots of five of them parachuted to safety. London issued air raid alerts three times yesterday, the last time from 8:03 PM to 10:42 PM. However, the German aircraft were intercepted and defeated before they could drop bombs on London. (Reuters Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>London: Last night, German aircraft attempted to sneak into the center of London with great ferocity, just hours after Hitler threatened retaliation for the British Air Force's heavy bombing of military targets in Berlin. However, countless anti-aircraft guns in southeastern London fired simultaneously, forming a network of fire that prevented the German aircraft from entering. Last night, the anti-aircraft fire in London was extremely intense, and more than a hundred searchlights illuminated the sky, as bright as day. The defenses were unprecedentedly tight. The flashing lights, mixed with the fire from the exploding anti-aircraft shells and the white, red, and blue flares dropped by the German aircraft, were a spectacle to behold. Suddenly, a flash of white light appeared, indicating brightness, presumably caused by a barrage balloon catching fire. (Reuters Telegram, 5th)</p>

Two British aircraft teams bombed Kakura and Marie Chai separately. Two Italian aircraft on land were destroyed. At the same time, British warships fired on Sesebala, causing slight damage to houses and injuring many civilians. As a result, they were still repelled by our destroyers and anti-aircraft guns, shooting down a total of seven enemy aircraft and capturing three people. After repelling the enemy aircraft, our aircraft began to retaliate.

<h3 id="e32">Random Notes on the European War (1): The Destitution of Young Hitler <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Young Hitler is now almost thirteen years old. He has endured many hardships, struggling with poverty, and is gradually about to see the end of his suffering. It is truly said that Heaven, in bestowing great responsibility upon a person, must first afflict his mind, tax his sinews and bones. Hitler later revealed this idea in his writings, but his dissatisfaction and resentment grew with each passing day. His level of self-discipline and purity of mind was even more advanced than in his childhood. When he lived in small hostels, he was known for not seeking out women. There was also another thing: other people often undressed in public rooms, without shame. When Hitler changed his clothes, he would always hide far away in the corner, secretly and uneasily, so no one had ever seen his body. He was also very meticulous about what he ate, partly because of his weak stomach, and partly because he believed that meat was unclean and could disturb his nature. He only ate vegetables and millet porridge. As for alcohol, he did not touch a drop. His eyes were huge, full of overflowing passion? Although his body was relatively thin and short, his head was described as "beautiful." He had a small mustache under his nose, and he walked with a very light step.</p>
<p>He wandered around the city of Vienna, often talking to himself. As soon as he had money, he would go to the opera, which was his only pastime. At this time, he loved to read the eccentric "Ethnology" written by the French Count Gobineau, and he supported Germanism. He also loved Wagner's music, and he had a special understanding of those operas. In addition to opposing communists and Jews, he also expressed hatred for members of parliament and other bureaucrats in democratic governments. He often went to the Austrian House of Representatives to listen to debates, and he was greatly angered when he saw that the members were mostly people of mixed race, not of German descent. At this time, in his own writings, he clearly explained how much he hated mixed-race people.</p>
<p>At the age of twenty-three, Hitler left Vienna for Munich, Germany. There, he worked as a painter or as an assistant to a picture framer. Two years later, the European War broke out, and he enlisted in the German army, first as a corporal, then as a sergeant, and was deeply valued by his superiors. His patriotic feelings were very high, and he spoke more than others among his peers. His superiors used his enthusiasm, and specially asked him to undertake solitary and dangerous work, such as delivering messages and solitary scouting. He was injured twice and was seriously suffocated by gas. During the war, he put a small photo of his mother in the left pocket of his uniform in front of his chest. During his leave, he was still strict with himself, behaving like an ascetic. At this time, he shaved off his beard, leaving only a short mustache.</p>
<p>The colonel of Hitler's regiment died in battle not long after the start of the war. Before long, a new commander arrived, and he followed the team to the front line. Suddenly, several bullets flew from above. Hitler jumped out of the ranks, covered the new commander with his body, and bravely shouted that he did not want the second commander to die in such a short time." His companions were somewhat puzzled by this gesture. Afterwards, they teased him and said that if he really wanted to save the commander, he should have pushed him down first, so that he was lying flat on the ground, and then covered his body. Standing in front of him was useless. But they admitted that he could be a hero, but it was difficult to be with him.</p>
<p>In the army, he never complained like other soldiers often did, and he never spoke ill of his superiors. His words and actions were completely unlike a soldier; he often used glory, patriotism, and sacrifice for the country as his mantra. However, some people said that he was too verbose. Once, he went to a stronghold in the rear and met a soldier who was listlessly talking on a military telephone. The soldier said that he did not care who won the battle. Hitler was furious when he heard this, and beat him severely. Later, he also reported this matter to his superiors, saying the reason why he was angry, and the officers praised and encouraged him. He was respectful and sincere to the officers, and could be said to be meticulous. One day, he and a brother were knocked down into the mud by the explosion of a German heavy artillery, and they could not even breathe. He once captured several French soldiers single-handedly and was awarded the Iron Cross First Class. Several young adjutants thought that such a brave soldier should be promoted to lieutenant, but Hitler's immediate superior said, "I will never promote such a neurotic person to be an officer."</p>
<p>Once, Hitler was injured and wrote a letter from the hospital to the commander saying, "Please call me back to camp immediately. I do not want to stay in Munich when my brothers are attacking the enemy." He returned to the team after recovering from his injuries, and still served as a sergeant. He looked at the war as if it were his own personal struggle. The German defeat was as if he himself had been defeated. This was the only heartbreaking thing since he had been unable to become an artist and had become a wanderer. When the news of the armistice arrived, he was in the hospital for the second time, lying in a hammock, burying his head under the pillow, and crying. Finally, he still attributed the cause of Germany's defeat to the Communist Party and the Jews, and only then did he feel a little relieved.</p>
<p>On the day the armistice treaty was signed, Hitler was already twenty-nine years old. He was more mature than those in history who had claimed to be world conquerors. In reality, although Hitler claimed to be this, the actual launch of this "great event" was delayed until he was fifty years old. In terms of personality, Hitler at this time had many similarities with Alexander I, Genghis Khan, Muhammad, Caesar, William I, and Napoleon. In terms of tools and preparations, he was even stronger than them in some respects. He was alone, without the burden of a family; no family, no friends, and he did not want to fall in love with women. As for his not drinking, it was well known to the public. His asceticism covered his physical surface with a mysterious color. He had a strong latent ability, which had been developed through many trials and tribulations, and could transform the pain he had suffered into a dream of victory. This belief became more and more difficult to shake. He was well-read and quite eloquent. The principles he put forward were always based on classics and could justify themselves. He had two pure dreams: one was to remember his mother, and the other was to realize the idea of ​​a Greater Germany. If he fell in love with anything, the final conclusion could not escape these two things. Outwardly, he was not very moving, but his inner strength was very impressive. This was similar to the previous group of people who claimed to be world conquerors. Their "seeds" were the same, and they were all born with different "gifts." They suffered disasters in their childhood, were depressed and unhappy, and even disturbed and agitated, acting recklessly. When they grew up, they were either addicted to sex and lived a promiscuous and chaotic life, or they were extremely eccentric in terms of sex.</p>
<p>In 1919, Hitler was ordered by his superior to go to Munich to participate in a gathering against Jews, anti-capitalists, anti-communists, and anti-anythingism, to spy on their actions. This small group had unique political views and wanted to use new methods to save the defeated Germany. They advocated that Germany must have a leader. Hitler, with his gray, watery eyes, a tuft of hair covering his forehead, a short beard, soft hands, and inner nervousness, sat there ferociously, listening with a self-proclaimed world conqueror's attitude. The second time he went to participate, this time not by order of his superiors, because the army was already useless, but he went himself. That time, he was elected as the seventh member of this gathering (that is, today's National Socialist Party). After all his failures, young Hitler finally became a politician.</p>
<p>In 1923, he led a failed rebellion and was imprisoned. In prison, he wrote a book, "My Struggle," in which he had written various plans to conquer the world fifteen years before he came to power. This can be said to be "unprecedented." He was released after one year and one month in prison. In 1932, he was appointed by President Hindenburg to form a cabinet. Thus, he seized power, eliminated dissidents, and became the dictator of Germany. In 1939, he realized his dream of conquering Europe (End of this article).</p>

<h3 id="e33">After U.S. Admiral Hepner Arrives in Shanghai, He Holds Two Important Meetings, Reviews the General Situation and Discusses Plans, the U.S. Does Not Concede on the Issue of Defense Zones <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>According to foreign sources, U.S. Asian Fleet Commander Admiral Hepner arrived in Shanghai at 1:00 PM the day before yesterday on the cruiser Marblehead. That afternoon, he met at the U.S. Consulate General with Fourth Fleet Commander Colonel Baker, Yangtze River Fleet Commander Glassford, and Acting Consul General Broderick. There were reports and discussions. Yesterday morning, Hepner resumed discussions with Broderick and others at the same location. When reporters asked Broderick about Hepner's mission and the content of the meetings, Broderick declined to comment. One official said that the purpose of the meetings between U.S. officials was to make contact with each other, which was a matter of course. However, authoritative sources believe that the discussions convened by Admiral Hepner must be related to the issue of defense zones and other current situation issues. Hepner's arrival must be to convey the intentions of the government and to determine the methods that the U.S. should take to deal with the current situation. As for the attitude of the U.S. government, it was reported yesterday that private individuals in this port had already received telegrams from Washington, stating that "The U.S. government has today formally and publicly warned Japan that the U.S. is paying close attention to every action of Japan in the Far East that affects Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies. At the same time, Secretary of State Hull publicly declared to reporters that the U.S. refuses to allow the Japanese to take over any defense zones left by British troops in the Shanghai International Settlement.</p>
<h3 id="e34">No Progress in Defense Zone Negotiations <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times stated that after the Shanghai International Settlement Volunteer Corps temporarily took over the "B" defense zone of the Public Concession, a rotational system has now been adopted. Before the 16th, the British troops of the West Fork Highland Regiment withdrew, and the A Company of the Volunteer Corps filled the defense for a week. It was decided that the cavalry and B Company would be successively transferred for defense, each guarding for four days. As of 8:00 PM yesterday (the 4th), the A Company replaced the B Company in rotation.</p>
<p>A Company Has a Longer Defense Period</p>
<p>A Company dispatches two officers and fifty-one soldiers from Company A, Company B, the Scottish Company, and the Light Machine Gun Company every day to defend five positions in the "B" defense zone. However, A Company has more soldiers, so it is stationed for one week each time, while B Company and the Cavalry Company have fewer soldiers, and each defends for four days. On average, the soldiers of the three major companies are deployed for twenty-four hours every sixteen days."</p>
<p>Defense Zone Talks Still Have No News</p>
<p>At the same time, there is still no news on the talks between the U.S. and Japan regarding the defense zone issue in this city. Therefore, it is difficult to determine how long the Volunteer Corps will defend in the "B" zone. Some people believe that the current method of the Volunteer Corps will continue for several months. As for the "D" defense zone, which was designated to be handed over to the Japanese army, the Japanese army has not yet taken it over. The area is currently guarded by patrolmen from the Shanghai Municipal Police Department and "City Police." The "Zi Lin West News" also stated that the U.S. and Japanese authorities are consulting on the issue of permanent patrol of the "B" defense zone of the Public Concession in this city. The situation is currently at a standstill. The "B" zone will continue to be defended by the International Volunteer Corps until the two sides reach a final decision."</p>
<p>Positions are Mostly on the North Bank of the Suzhou Creek</p>
<p>It is found that the "B" zone originally started from the Bund in the east and ended at Yuqiaqing Road, from Eddoe Road in the south to the boundary road in the north. However, at present, except for the Russian team of the Volunteer Corps guarding the southern end of the Waibaidu Bridge, no Volunteer Corps is deployed south of the Suzhou Creek. The manpower dispatched is concentrated on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek, stationed in four defense houses and one position, all directly under the jurisdiction of the district command headquarters located in the Special First Court.</p>
<p>The Number of Soldiers Determines the Number of Times</p>
<p>The duration of the company's deployment is determined by the number of soldiers it can deploy. It is now determined that A Company took over the defense for the second time last night. On the 11th of this month, the cavalry and armored vehicle teams will be transferred for defense. On the 15th, B Company will be deployed again. On the 19th, A Company will be deployed again in rotation. Each defense house north of the Suzhou Creek is stationed with one non-commissioned officer and four soldiers, each deployment lasting twenty-four hours. During this time, each soldier takes turns on sentry duty for two hours and rests for four hours.</p>
<p>The Facilities in the Defense Houses are Very Comfortable</p>
<p>The facilities in the defense houses are complete, and every effort is made to make the soldiers comfortable. A row of marching beds is placed along the wall, and bedding is provided by the soldiers themselves. There is also a radio for playing music. Three meals a day are quite exquisite and are delivered by trucks dispatched by the Volunteer Corps Headquarters. When the soldiers are resting, they either play cards, read books in bed, or chat and laugh, and their spirits are very full.</p>

<p>German Aircraft Attacked England</p>
<p>An American military expert here said that during the recent Anglo-German air war, if the purpose of Germany's recent air raids was to eliminate the strength of the British Air Force in order to attempt a landing in England, it was a failure. The loss of German aircraft was at least three to one compared to British aircraft. The production of British aircraft has now been increased, and 3,000 of the 11,000 aircraft ordered from the United States have been delivered. In addition, the United Kingdom can obtain an unlimited supply of aviation gasoline and lubricant oil. On the contrary, Germany does not have refined lubricant oil, which prevents the speed of German aircraft from increasing.</p>

She feels that this war is destroying both China and Japan. Japan is ruled by a military dictatorship. The people were initially deceived about the purpose of the war against China. However, after three years of war, the Japanese people are no longer fooled. Although the heavy burden of war is unbearable, they are still afraid and dare not resist. According to reports, anyone who makes such remarks in Japan will be imprisoned. Therefore, Ms. Matsui is now exiled in other countries and cannot return to her country.

<p>The Current Situation is Abnormal The Cost of the Survey is Huge</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council conducts a census within the boundary every five years. This year is again the year for the survey. However, the current population within the boundary is about two and a half to three times more than in 1935. The density of the population in the Concession is as mentioned above.

In view of the current abnormal situation and in order to save expenses, the Shanghai Municipal Council has decided at its regular meeting that this year's population census will be postponed.</p>

<p>Since Vietnam was threatened by the Japanese Navy, it first prohibited the import of military supplies into the Chinese mainland via Vietnam in early July. The Japanese also sent supervisors to Vietnam. At that time, the Shanghai-Vietnam shipping route was suspended for a time and then resumed on the 10th. In the middle of last month, the Japanese again asked the Vietnamese authorities to allow the army, navy, and air force to pass through Vietnam in an attempt to attack, causing the situation in Vietnam to become tense again.</p>
<p>The Situation in Vietnam is Uncertain</p>
<p>Although the French and Japanese governments have directly negotiated, there have been no results so far. Therefore, on the 28th of last month, the Vietnamese authorities voluntarily closed the ports for precautionary reasons. The Hong Kong-Vietnam-Shanghai shipping route was interrupted again. The details have been recorded in previous reports. In the past week, rumors have been rife, mainly because the situation in Vietnam is unstable.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank issued subsidiary currency notes of one and five cents, totaling 7 million yuan, with the approval of the Ministry of Finance, in order to alleviate the shortage of subsidiary currency notes in Shanghai. They have been issued in batches and are circulating in the market. They were all printed by the American Yongning Company. A reporter from the "Xin Sheng News Agency" learned from the Central Bank yesterday about the issue of counterfeit five-cent notes found on the market. It was confirmed that the English on the back of the genuine notes was (UNION PUBLISHERS AND PRINTERS FED. INC. U.S.A.), while the counterfeit notes were (UNIONPRINTING CO. U.S.A.). In fact, this was due to batch printing. The former was issued later and printed by the American United Yongning Company, while the latter was issued earlier and printed by the American Yongning Company, and were not counterfeit notes. Currently, all the notes printed and issued are the former. As for the counterfeit five-cent notes found on the market, the paper is rough, easily damaged after friction, and the printing is blurred and unclear, making it obvious that they are counterfeit notes. The number of these counterfeit notes found on the market is not large, and the industry has been investigating.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Rice Industry Association sent a letter to the two authorities yesterday regarding the continuous rise in rice prices. The letter stated, "Respected Sirs, in recent days, rice prices have risen and cannot be suppressed. Although the Evaluation Committee has exercised its judgment and relaxed the price limit in accordance with the authorities' intention, it is still ineffective. Rice prices are still rising, and today (5th) the market quotation is even more soaring. The top-grade Saigon rice is quoted as high as 67-8 yuan, which is far from the 61.5 yuan limit set by the Evaluation Committee for top-grade Saigon rice."</p>
<p>Difficult to Buy Low-Quality Goods at High Prices</p>
<p>"If we purchase low-quality goods at the highest rice price set by the Evaluation Committee, it will be difficult to get what we want. Our retail rice shops, which directly supply the food for the entire city, purchase low-quality goods at the highest price. Even if we sell them at a loss, the citizens do not understand the truth and misunderstand us, and criticisms follow. At this time, the prices of all goods are rising, and the general public is already feeling threatened. However, rice prices are rising again and again without end, and people's livelihood is even more unbearable. Our members also feel very difficult. If we do not take measures to help them, we will cause most of the poor people to be unable to find food. The weak will be filled in the trenches, and the strong will take risks, which will also affect local security. Our association witnesses the chaotic situation in the market and the endless rise in rice prices, with hundreds of crises. We are compelled to submit this letter and request that your bureau quickly find ways to provide relief, thoroughly clarify the chaotic situation in the rice market, strictly enforce the price limit set by the Evaluation Committee, and send more officers to strictly inspect the rice market at any time."</p>
<p>One Rice Weevil Was Arrested Yesterday</p>
<p>"If there is any act of exceeding the price limit or secretly raising prices, we will immediately detain them to maintain people's food and protect security. This is addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the Board of Directors of the French Concession." It was heard that a rice weevil was arrested by the market police in the market yesterday morning and sent to justice.</p>

<p>Yang Binghua, also known as Xiaoyang the Clerk, is a local man, 37 years old, living at No. 15 Pingquan Villa, Maibike Road. Before August 13, he was a detective in the Nanshi Police Department. After leaving his job, he relied on his mistress, Ding Wan'e, a famous Shanghai Opera actress (36 years old, a local, living at No. 21 Xinxin'an Lane, Mintineyin Road), to support his life. Last year, Yang formed an inseparable bond with the daughter of the Eastern Hotel, Tianzhen, a palm reader (who was once sensationalized for robbing diamond rings).</p>
<p>A Lasting Bond</p>
<p>They built a golden house to hide their love. Soon, Yang raised funds to go to Suzhou to open the Dalu Entertainment Park, and took Tianzhen with him, abandoning Ding like a worn-out shoe. This year, Ding discovered that her lover had a new love, and she could not help but feel jealous. She rushed to the place, but Yang actually favored Tianzhen and beat Ding severely. Ding came to Shanghai in anger and took all the rosewood big beds, noodle soup tables, five-drawer cabinets, and wardrobes in the house, claiming to entrust the Detai Rosewood Workshop on Zilai Street to repair them, and moved them to No. 21 Rafide Road for hiding. When Yang's Suzhou Dalu Entertainment Park failed and returned, he discovered the theft and repeatedly questioned Ding.</p>
<p>Firmly Denies It</p>
<p>Yang Binghua hired lawyer Yang Dong to represent him and filed a private prosecution against Ding in the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court for theft under Article 320 of the Criminal Law. According to the complaint, the court opened a second criminal trial by Judge Zhu Chuzhe yesterday morning. The defendant hired lawyer Jin Yu to defend and argued that the two parties were spouses and could not file a private prosecution according to law. After a detailed hearing in court, because the two parties were not formally legally married, the hearing was continued. As a result of the hearing, the court made a judgment in court. The main text of Ding Wan'e was theft and was sentenced to 40 days of detention with a two-year reprieve. The defendant declared that he would not accept the judgment and could appeal to the High Third Branch after receiving the judgment.</p>

<p>Since the French Concession police and French defense forces implemented a blockade of all road junctions along Avenue Edward VII on the morning of the 4th, taking strict precautions, almost all police personnel and French troops have been mobilized. The area has been peaceful and orderly for days, ensuring public safety. Rumors that the French Concession's precautions were due to the Vietnam issue are purely fabrications and not true. The public is very concerned about when these precautions will be lifted. Yesterday, a reporter from this newspaper inquired with the French Concession authorities. It was learned that the timing of the removal of these various precautionary measures, such as road closures, will depend on the situation. It is expected that the precautions will be extended until after the "September 18th" anniversary, as this will save some procedures.</p>

<p>(Chongqing, 5th) Drama has a profound influence on moral education. Since the beginning of the War of Resistance, schools have established drama clubs and performed plays for propaganda purposes. Many newly established theater groups have also emerged. The Ministry of Education, recognizing that although the scripts performed by various theater groups have certain advantages, they often violate educational theories in terms of technique. If not corrected, it is easy to cause problems. The Ministry has ordered drama schools and theater groups to submit the scripts they plan to perform to the Ministry for review from an educational perspective. Over the past year, it has reviewed more than eighty scripts and is now in the process of carefully selecting and compiling a booklet of selected plays to meet the needs of theater groups in various regions.</p>

<h3 id="e66">International Rober Cup Tennis Finals China Lost Yesterday US Team Wins Championship After Five Hard Sets Lin Baohua and Wang Wenzheng Lose to Carson <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The 1940 International Rober Cup Lawn Tennis Championship unexpectedly fell into the hands of the Americans. The Chinese and American teams continued their unfinished battle yesterday afternoon on Avenue Joffre. First, the Chinese representatives Lin Baohua and Wang Wenzheng easily won the first set 6-3 last week. The second set was also fought to a tie, with each side winning five games. The situation was very favorable, and it was expected that they would be able to avenge their years of regret. Unexpectedly, after yesterday's clash, the second set became a difficult and inseparable situation. As a result, the American side won with a score of 10 to 8, each winning one set. The score was all tied and the American side had the lead at 9 to 8. Unfortunately, in the 18th game, Lin Baohua's serve, which he was very confident in, was lost after two comeback points, which was extremely regrettable. In the third set, each side had three and four, and the American side still had the advantage. When they lost two consecutive games, the American side won again with a score of 6 to 4, and took a 2-1 lead. At the beginning of the fourth set, China and the United States still won the game with their serves. From the eighth game, Wang Wenzheng won the game with a ballistic serve. Lin Wang also broke Carson's very confident serve. Therefore, with a heroic posture of winning three consecutive games, they won back the fourth set with a score of 6 to 4, tying the score at two. In the final deciding set, unexpectedly, the Chinese team had bad luck. Wang Wenzheng's serve was broken by the American side. Carson won three consecutive games. After three to five, it was impossible to save the situation. The United States defeated China 3-2 to win the 1940 International Rober Cup championship.</p>

<p>National Rice Prices Ignore Restrictions Overtly Doing Dark Deals National Rice Has Price Limits But No Limits...Foreign Rice Has Evaluated Prices But Does Not Abide By Them The Rice Market Has Become a Dark World...The Market Soared by Two or Three Yuan Again Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was in a chaotic state. Only ordinary broken rice and red rice still had a formal market, opening at 56 yuan. Other goods had become a monopolized situation, and no prices were quoted, all being done through dark deals. Although they claimed to be extremely secretive, if you don't want people to know, don't do it. Yesterday, a customer reported a business to the Public Works Department for disciplinary action. However, speculators were not afraid of the law. Although the market seemed to have stopped invisibly, dark trading was still lively, with a great appearance of secret publicity. No. 1 Saigon fire-milled rice was all priced at 65, 66, or 67 yuan. No. 1 and small fire-milled rice were priced at 62, 63, or 64 yuan. Market prices soared by two or three yuan. Actual sales were only a small embellishment by the shops on this street. The thoughts of merchants and the absorption of transactions and speculations accounted for the majority. At a time when stocks were surging, the rise in rice prices, with the new rice about to enter the market, seemed unreasonable. However, rice merchants and speculators were still fanatical about manipulating and monopolizing the market. Although the Public Works Department has reported them, this trend has not stopped. The original English-Chinese Company No. 1 Saigon exceeded the limit by one and a half yuan, with a dark price of 73 yuan. Subsequently, prices of 74 and 75 yuan were quoted, with various parties using excuses such as the interruption of Haiphong and the inconsistency of pricing to raise prices. In fact, after the Shanghai market rose, orders were close to being placed. As for transportation, it is still open, and goods are arriving continuously. The routes to Siam and Burma have not been blocked. Eight thousand bags of rice were traded yesterday, and the original packaging was three hundred and fifty bags. Most of them were collected by hoarders.</p>
<p>Foreign rice continues to rise in price and continues to arrive in Shanghai. Yesterday, the Panama ship Essl, managed by the Hualun Foreign Company, arrived directly from Saigon with 16,118 bags of rice. It arrived in Shanghai around 7 AM yesterday morning and was unloaded at the French Concession Observatory Wharf and stored in the Taichangxiang and French Post Office Company's new warehouses. In addition, the Yihua Foreign Company's Taisheng ship, which arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday evening, also brought 300 bags from Hong Kong and was unloaded at the Roosevelt Wharf. It is heard that the Shanghai-Vietnam route will soon resume, and Saigon rice will be available in a steady stream. There is absolutely no need to worry about the food supply for the citizens of this city. (Zu)</p>
<p>National rice originally had a price limit, but rice merchants did not comply, and those who tried to ban it could do nothing about it. They pretended not to care. Because national rice had a price limit but foreign rice did not, the price of foreign rice rose step by step at that time, and the price of japonica rice soared in dark deals. Recently, after rice merchants openly evaluated prices, foreign rice had to be evaluated. National rice, which originally had a price limit, could now exceed the limit and no longer be evaluated. As a result, national rice has been soaring in price in dark deals for days because it is not restricted by price evaluations. Foreign rice is also being sold in dark deals, and the authorities can do nothing about it. According to this inference, in the future, both national and foreign rice will either have a price limit but no limits, or have evaluated prices but not abide by them. This is truly, as the Shanghai elder said, "a bit of a farce," and the Shanghai rice market can truly be called a dark world.</p>
<p>Therefore, the national glutinous rice, which was not subject to price restrictions yesterday, saw a resurgence in sales as a result, and prices continued to rise by about two yuan. Jinyue Special was priced at 570 yuan, and Changdan goods were priced at 678 yuan. Hong Kong glutinous rice was similar. Thick and thin japonica and other national rice were frantically sought after in the off-market dark deals. Each price continued to rise by more than two yuan. Changbang fresh and clear japonica was 78 yuan, white japonica was 756 yuan, Changzhou Sukun japonica was 745 yuan, and Nangang original early rice was 745 yuan, with spot at 72.5 yuan to 72 yuan. Only thirty to forty loads of new japonica rice from Zhoupu arrived, and the Qiaotou goods were sold out. At this opportune moment, people were even more enthusiastic. The price of 69 yuan, an increase of two yuan, was sold out in one go. Taicang's new sheep-tip rice was transported by bicycle with eighteen loads, priced at 66 yuan, with spot at 63.5 yuan, also an increase of two yuan. In short, the price of each item continued to rise by two or three yuan. Only foreign rice, due to the evaluation relationship, sellers were unwilling to sell and buyers were not brave enough to buy, resulting in this lifeless and secretly trading market.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Cannon Car Flour Sells Actively in the North at 17 Yuan <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the flour market showed signs of improvement. It was found that the board of directors of the No. 1 flour factory had not changed. Sales were gradually becoming brisk. As for domestic sales, although the mooncake season was coming to an end, the two factories had reduced their supply by half, inevitably leading to demand exceeding supply. In particular, the Phoenix brand of Japanese flour, which was subject to speculative activities, was the most popular in the market. Because the rice market was stagnant, more hoarders were buying futures flour. Transactions reached 15,000 to 16,000 bags, with September quoted at 15.1 yuan and October at 15.4 to 15.48 yuan, an increase of 0.2 to 0.3 yuan from the previous day. It was also heard that the Green Cannon Car flour was also being inquired about in the North, with nearly 10,000 bags traded at a price of 17 yuan. The market has a promising prospect of recovery.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the price also saw a rise. Since the rise in rice prices, although cargo owners have had the determination to persist, they are ultimately bound by the environment and cannot transport the goods into the concession, where Japanese factories suppress prices and collect them. Therefore, the market has no way to develop. Yesterday, the eating board of the Yixin Factory was relatively relaxed.

<p>Yesterday, the unofficial gold market fell sharply from high levels, unable to recover. It initially surged, then suddenly plummeted, with prices nearing the 6,200 yuan mark. News spread that the U.S. government was concerned about British defense withdrawal areas in the city, as well as Vietnam, the Dutch East Indies, and other places, and had warned Japan. As a result, the Japanese foreign exchange market suddenly softened amidst speculators selling 1.5 million U.S. dollars. A "cut losses" trend started in the gold market. Consequently, a certain bank and money exchange company first bought in, rising from the morning opening of 6,380 yuan to 6,405 yuan. However, under the selling pressure from gold firms and two other banks, as well as retail investors selling due to negative news, prices plummeted. In the afternoon, prices continued to decline to a low of 6,180 yuan. Later, due to continuous absorption by Hong Kong-funded gold firms, as well as Chinese banks absorbing foreign exchange, prices softened slightly and short covering began, eventually rising back to 6,135 yuan, a drop of 95 yuan. After closing, the market weakened again. The sentiment of all parties shifted from excitement to fatigue. The total trading volume was over 5,000 taels. Ornament gold fell by 10 yuan to 640 yuan.

Then, due to banks and money exchange companies joining in, it rose another 25 yuan, reaching a high price of 6,405 yuan, but with very little trading. Later, due to the sudden hardening of foreign exchange, a certain bank suddenly released a large amount of long positions, coupled with gold firms and money exchange companies selling more and buying less, it immediately retreated to 6,320 yuan. Subsequently, another bank slightly bought, briefly rising back 20 yuan. However, because the exchange market continued to soften, a certain bank and gold firms launched another round of aggressive selling, and at this time, leveraged long positions also painfully closed out, falling further to 6,240 yuan. After this, favorable rumors suddenly spread, and foreign exchange stopped softening and tightened slightly. Gold firms and a certain bank switched from selling to buying, and briefly rose back to 6,305 yuan. Unexpectedly, the foreign exchange market softened again at noon, and selling pressure reappeared. Banks and other groups tended to sell off, and before closing, it plummeted to 6,210 yuan, and the closing price was only 6,220 yuan. The initial opening in the afternoon was still good, raising by 10 yuan. Banks released gold firms by 20 yuan, at 6,240 yuan. However, gold firms and banks vigorously sold off, and the exchange market at this time hardened, and the price retreated to the 6,100 yuan level, seeing a low price of 6,180 yuan. After entering, the foreign exchange trend slightly changed, and leveraged long positions took advantage of the low price to add positions, and securities firms also searched for a lot, so it once rose back to 6,240 yuan. However, the result was 6,225 yuan, a decline of 95 yuan compared to the previous day. The full-day fluctuation was 225 yuan. After closing, the off-market situation was weak.

<p>The securities unofficial market continued to rise yesterday, but the trend was緩. The shorts had been patient up to this point, thinking that the market price was already high and would fall back, and hoping to wait a moment longer for unexpected changes. However, they did not know that after the Shanghai silver market became extremely loose, there were very few outlets. There were many investors in public bonds, and after being collected by various banks, the circulating chips related to the reserve positions were gradually bought month by month, and became increasingly scarce. The long-awaited large-scale Sino-US loan that has been rumored recently is gradually reaching the hot stage. This kind of loan, which ostensibly aids China, is actually indirectly reducing the opposing forces between the US and the UK. There is a reason for this, and success is not far away. The current trend of public debt already has underlying factors, but it has not yet reached the point of outbreak. A huge涨势 will come later, and it will definitely not collapse midway because it has already risen too much. Yesterday, after a slight fluctuation, it rose again. Type C once again broke through the 4 yuan mark and saw a high price again. Types A and B also saw new high prices. The buyers were mainly Tianfeng, Hongda, Lianhe, and Quanri, who bought in throughout the day. Tongshen, Jiufeng, Wuyuan, and Hengfu also searched for them at any time. No. 41 went into A and came out of C. Lianyih entered first and exited later. Tongkang, Runli, Xinchang, and Shunchang were all selling. Most of the retail shorts have not yet been covered, and there is still much hope for the future. As a result, the market price continued to rise by 2-3 jiao. The total transaction volume was estimated to be about 1.2-1.3 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 100 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 14 yuan 5 jiao.</p>
<p>The stock market of the Zhongye Public Institute yesterday had a very good potential. The selling of sellers was particularly difficult and were easily absorbed. Prices did not change much, and the transaction volume was extremely large. Rubber stocks were also stable.</p>
<p>London, 4th (Wednesday) dispatch: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks only fluctuated slightly in HSBC bank stocks. HSBC's UK-registered shares fell back by 1.5 pounds, with a price of 65.5 pounds. Hong Kong-registered shares remained unchanged, and the rest were also unchanged.</p>

<p>The yarn and cloth, which had risen for 18 consecutive days, with 20-count double horse yarn rising by a total of 130 yuan and 5 jiao, saw a slight reaction and declined yesterday. Spot sales remained sluggish, and relying solely on the support of enthusiastic market sentiment, of course, cannot be sustained for long. General speculators will base their advances and retreats on the ups and downs of the gold market. Therefore, with the rebound of foreign exchange and the weakening of gold, the yarn and cloth followed.

The statistics of the transaction volume in the first half of the day show 2,380 bales, and the closing price was 1,014 yuan and a half, 16 yuan lower than the previous day.

<p>Spot cotton trading has become active again, but most factories absorbed Qiwang at the high prices of the past, so their inventory is still sufficient.

<h3 id="e87">Dredging the River Mouth <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The Suzhou Creek in this city, also known as the Wusong River, has been silting up for a long time. At low tide, it is only two to three feet deep, making it difficult for ships to navigate and hindering irrigation of farmland within the mouth of the river. The Dao Xian (county magistrate) has long ordered the Shanghai County and the Foreign Affairs Commissioners to jointly survey the silted river channel from the harbor mouth to the bridge. It is planned to use the machinery of the Manufacturing Bureau to dredge the river, which is estimated to take about four months to complete. Dredging machines and ships have been moved to the harbor mouth, and boatmen have been hired to transport the dredged silt. Dredging began on the eighth day of this month, with dispatched commissioners supervising at all times and supervising officers regularly sitting on ships to supervise carefully, in order to complete the work quickly. From then on, boat owners and farmers will all benefit.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Buddha in a Clam <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The Ten Thousand Buddha Hall in the Xingjiao Temple in Yangzhou City, which was destroyed by fire last year, has now been rebuilt and is brand new! In the past, the hall was inlaid with gold-plated small Buddhas, numbering in the tens of thousands, hence the name Ten Thousand Buddha Hall. Now, it has been slightly replenished. It was heard yesterday that someone donated a clam, about eight inches long, with a total of eighteen Buddha images naturally formed on both sides, with distinct beards and eyebrows. It is now believed that the ancient saying "Buddha in a Clam" is not an empty one. According to the monks, this clam was obtained from the riverbank by a farmer in the northern countryside in the spring. The craftsmanship of nature is truly remarkable!</p>

<h3 id="e90">After Reading "An Open Letter from Overseas Chinese in the Philippines" <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Sha Tuo</p>
<p>In this newspaper's "Local News" column on the third of this month, there was an open letter from Mr. Li Pingying, an overseas Chinese in the Philippines, to the editor of this newspaper. Although Mr. Li modestly said, "In this letter, there are no brilliant words or outstanding theories," after reading Mr. Li's "open letter," I was deeply moved. Mr. Li's "open letter," as he said, is indeed "every word crafted is the crystallization of my bitter tears!"</p>
<p>As an overseas Chinese, Mr. Li is able to care so much about everything in the motherland. I, who am "residing" in this isolated island, have endless admiration for Mr. Li. At the same time, we thousands of compatriots who are indulging in a life of pleasure on this isolated island should suddenly wake up! We should all read Mr. Li's "open letter"!</p>
<p>Mr. Li arrived in the embrace of the motherland from the distant Nanyang a few days ago. He had long admired the greatness and prosperity of Shanghai, and therefore always wanted to see Shanghai's elegance to fulfill his lifelong ambition. But when Mr. Li stepped into Shanghai, what Shanghai gave to Mr. Li was:</p>
<p>Dancers and prostitutes outnumbered the carp in the Huangpu River; also: guides, gambling dens, salted pork shops; also: hotels and dance halls; also: kidnappings, assassinations; also: bones of those "frozen to death" on the road;... All of this caused Mr. Li's impression of Shanghai to undergo a rapid change, which was—a den of demons!</p>
<p>Therefore, Mr. Li will leave this "den of demons" tomorrow to go to the interior, because Mr. Li hates everything in Shanghai and curses the compatriots in Shanghai, so he does not want to stay in this "den of demons" any longer! I believe that when Mr. Li arrives in the interior, his disappointment with the motherland will definitely be restored, and I also believe that the motherland is growing up and moving towards a new path.</p>
<p>Since Mr. Li's "open letter" is "open," it is obviously not only for the editor of this newspaper. Therefore, as a Chinese compatriot, I would like to offer some explanations to Mr. Li's "open letter."</p>
<p>First: Shanghai is already a fallen land. The name "isolated island" comes from this. Therefore, Mr. Li came to Shanghai, this "den of demons," not to embrace the "motherland." This point, I think, is very important, because Mr. Li is an "overseas Chinese," and Mr. Li's "open letter" will definitely have a great influence on an "overseas Chinese." Therefore, it leads to—</p>
<p>Second: Everything Mr. Li sees is a phenomenon that is bound to exist in a "big city" in modern capitalist society. Guides, dancers, prostitutes, salted pork shops, kidnappings, gambling dens (only assassinations are a unique phenomenon), all of these can be found in all modern "big cities." I believe that the reason why Mr. Li found these sinful phenomena and felt grief and indignation is because Mr. Li regarded Shanghai as the "motherland," and therefore felt extremely disappointed. As I said above, in fact, Mr. Li himself said: Shanghai is only a "den of demons"!</p>
<p>However, Shanghai is different from other fallen lands. I say the above words, but I don't help some people who are indulging in a life of pleasure. I think those people should put Mr. Li's open letter on their desks as a "motto." But here, I only have one sentence to tell Mr. Li and all "overseas Chinese" abroad, that is: "On the one hand, it is lewd and shameless, and on the other hand, it is serious work"! Mr. Li, who stayed in Shanghai for a week, probably didn't see it!</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Li is leaving Shanghai to go to the interior. I think that Mr. Li will not have those unpleasant impressions he got in Shanghai in the interior, so Mr. Li will also be sure: It was a mistake to "come to Shanghai" and wrongly regard it as "embracing the motherland"!</p>
<p>At the same time, I hope that all the compatriots in Shanghai should read Mr. Li's "open letter." If there are shortcomings, correct them; if there are none, be encouraged. Although Mr. Li "curses the compatriots in Shanghai," this is Mr. Li's "angry words." We should thank Mr. Li, because his "open letter" is nothing less than a five-hundred-pound bomb in this muddy and chaotic Shanghai!</p>

<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 6: A Dangerous Experience</p>
<p>I asked again, "Then, after you came out of the Asia Hotel, did you come directly here?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne said: "No, I wanted to know how your tailing of Yu Gantang was going, and I also expected that you would be puzzled by my sudden disappearance, so I went back to my apartment. Shi Gui told me about your experiences, so I rushed to Changming Lane and met Song Zhaolin."</p>
<p>I said: "Song Zhaolin? Is that the tall, thin guy in the light blue and white striped suit and shirt?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne replied: "That's him. He is a friend of Yu Gantang and told me a lot about Yu Gantang. However, he tried his best to defend Yu Gantang, saying that he had nothing to do with the murder."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou hurriedly asked, "Do you believe him too? If he has nothing to do with this murder, why doesn't he say a word?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne replied, "Of course I won't completely accept Song Zhaolin's words. It's not a problem that Yu Gantang refuses to speak. However, the most urgent thing at the moment is how to get the person who shot me."</p>
<p>I suddenly had an idea that I suddenly thought of. "Hawthorne, do you think the person who shot you could be Zhao Boxiong? He is also very tall."</p>
<p>Hawthorne hugged his right knee with both hands, looked at the floor, and slowly replied, "This is indeed possible. It's a pity that I never had the chance to take a closer look at his face. I hate myself for being too cautious."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou said: "If it's him, things will be simpler; otherwise, there will be another person, which will be even more troublesome."</p>
<p>Hawthorne said: "I guess that's definitely not an extra complication. Even if the shooter is not Zhao Boxiong himself, he must belong to his line. You don't need to worry too much."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou said, "Then, what method do you plan to use to find this Zhao Boxiong?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne frowned and replied: "This has to rely on the power of your officialdom. The first step is to contact the person in charge of the hotel in the name of a civil servant, and then you can carefully investigate the waiters in various departments. If there are still twists and turns in the matter and we cannot start for a while, the second step is to send a few capable detectives disguised as waiters to wait carefully over there." (98)</p>
<h3 id="e93">The Goldfish's Luck? <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Li Fu</p>
<p>In a wide-mouthed glass tank, there are three or four golden and black goldfish, with a pair of bulging eyeballs, swaying their wide and open tails, leisurely swimming back and forth in a stem of green aquatic plants. Reflected by the water, they appear even more vividly colored, making anyone who sees them have a sense of liking for them. Therefore, not only do noble and gorgeous halls need their embellishment, but also ordinary people's homes and children's earthenware pots and porcelain bowls have their traces. Even the general poor class, who do not have the ability to invite them home, will stand and watch as much as possible when they encounter a goldfish stall on the roadside.</p>
<p>In zoology and everyday legends, it is said that goldfish are a variant of trout. But I have never seen how they changed, and I don't even know how they changed; however, I always think that they used cruel methods like women binding their feet in the past to create such a pair of strange eyes and a wide tail that is not good at swimming. Although the posture is graceful and the appearance is beautiful, and it can make people fall in love at first sight, their innate skills are almost completely stripped away. If they are not protected by people and live in glass tanks or lotus ponds, and they want to use their timid and small bodies to survive in nature, the goldfish family would have become a historical term like dinosaurs, etc. long ago.</p>
<p>Therefore, although goldfish were destroyed in their innate nature, and thus had defects in their skills, they were loved by people, and they were able to live freely in their small world without spending a trace of effort, and they did not have to be afraid and frightened in stormy seas, and they could also proudly say to other fish: "Who among you can ascend to the hall of elegance like me!"</p>
<p>Is this the luck or misfortune of the goldfish?</p>

<p>— Translated by Luo Men</p>
<p>Fellow citizens! I advise you that our country does not need a comfortable life, but a life of striving and achievement. If we are lazy; if we only seek luxurious, indolent comfort and ignoble peace; if we avoid the arduous struggles that determine the life and death of people, then people braver and stronger than us will surpass us, and they will seize sovereignty over the world for themselves.</p>
<p>Therefore, let us face a life of struggle, determined to do our duty well and bravely; determined to support justice with facts and words; determined to serve noble ideals honestly and courageously, but with practical methods.</p>
<p>Most importantly, if we believe that struggle is just, then let us not avoid struggle, whether it is spiritual or physical, domestic or foreign; because only through struggle, through arduous and dangerous action, can we ultimately achieve the true goal of national strength.</p>

<p>— Tao</p>
<p>A Sideline for Extras</p>
<p>There are probably many women in the world who think that Hollywood is an ideal paradise, and that everyone there can immediately become a star. So every year, countless beautiful women go to Hollywood, but in the end, they are all disappointed! Their beautiful dreams become bubbles, and only a few women get a barely-surviving extra position. Because their income as extras is not enough to make ends meet, they have recently come up with a sideline, which is "stick twirling." We often see the "stick twirling" trick in movies, where a person twirls a stick around their body, front, back, left, and right, making various beautiful poses. They have now formed a group, each with a unique costume. They can perform in song and dance scenes or parades in films, and they can also be hired by advertising or publicity companies to earn money. Now this "stick twirling" trick has become very popular, and almost every Hollywood woman is learning it. It may soon become a fashionable exercise tool!</p>

<p>All the staff of the Education Film Department of the China Film Studio are now led by Yuan Congmei, working hard in groups somewhere, and are required to complete the first phase of military education films "Chinese Air Force" and other four films within September, including:</p>
<p>The first group is "Chinese Air Force," with director Li Zhiqing and cinematographers Chen Jiguang, Zhu Shutao, etc., working at air force officer schools, air force sergeant schools, air force machinery factories, and air force units in various locations, and about half of the film has been completed. In addition, the situation of commemorating the "August 14" Air Force Day in various places this year will also be added to this film, and cinematographers sent by "China" to various photography stations are filming separately.</p>
<p>The second group is "Infantry Shooting Education," directed by Yuan Congmei himself, with cinematographers Wu Wiyun and other staff members, preparing to film at the training classes of two central military officer schools and the headquarters of the military academy. The script has been completed and they are rushing to produce storyboards and dialogues, etc., and will start filming on the 10th of this month.</p>
<p>The third group is "Gliders," directed and photographed by Luo Jun, preparing to film the "manufacturing" and "flight" of gliders in various places. They are currently working on writing the screenplay. The outline of the screenplay has been drafted and filming will begin soon. The participating units include glider training classes and air force units.</p>
<p>The fourth group is "Parachutes," with director Zhou Yan and cinematographer, collecting materials and writing scripts in various places. Filming can begin simultaneously with "Gliders" as soon as it is completed.</p>

<p>— Rui Hongchu</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Kunshan, from Wuxing, is only twenty years old, likes Peking opera, and imitates the movements of actors, singing and reciting quite similarly. He studies Qingyi in the Cheng style. When the Silk and Cloth Industry Knowledge Mutual Aid Society was established two years ago, Kunyou joined the Peking Opera group and strived for further study. He hired teachers to teach him plays such as Mei Longzhen, Yutangchun, Visiting Mother, Wujiapo, Joining the Army, Jin Suoji, and Yu Zhou Feng, and his skills improved day by day. His voice is sweet and pleasant, and his pronunciation is clear. His stage presence is sophisticated and delicate, worthy of being a rising star in the amateur world.</p>

<p>An Explanation of "Li Xiangjun"</p>
<p>The stage play "Li Xiangjun" was performed at the theater last month. The play has now been filmed by Jin Xing and is scheduled to be released at the Jin Cheng on the 12th of this month. Here is an interview with the playwright.</p>
<p>The first question——</p>
<p>(Q) How did you write "Li Xiangjun" and what was your motivation?</p>
<p>(A) How did I write "Li Xiangjun"? Because of the themes of The Peach Blossom Fan, as we see them today:</p>
<p>(1) Although the times are different, the environment is quite similar;</p>
<p>(2) There is too much material, and we must select the key points in the treatment. At the same time, it is better to write about the common people than to write about the great men and gentlemen, so the theme focuses on the individual part of Li Xiangjun.</p>
<p>(3) Before processing the material, I first conducted a thorough study of The Peach Blossom Fan itself (including historical research, scene arrangement, and individual character descriptions) before I began to write.</p>
<p>(4) The theme is that even prostitutes value integrity, while Hou Chaozong compromises and surrenders. Through the feelings of separation and reunion, write about the feelings of rise and fall.</p>
<p>The second question——</p>
<p>(Q) What are the differences between stage and film?</p>
<p>(A) (1) On stage, the division of acts and the appearance and disappearance of characters are subject to restrictions, and the material inevitably requires a shortened writing method in time to make the facts before and after connect. That is to say, in order to make the connection before and after, it is necessary to seek its relevance.</p>
<p>(2) In terms of film, it is not restricted by space. What cannot be clearly expressed on stage can be clearly written or inserted separately in the film. In other words, the film is whole, and the stage is partial.</p>
<p>(3) The progress of the plot on stage focuses on dialogue, while the film can incorporate the screen, so that it can take care of everything.</p>
<p>(4) Because many facts in stage plays rely entirely on dialogue to explain, while in movies, all the plots that cannot be seen in plays can be fully performed on the screen.</p>

<p>— Shen Jian</p>
<p>It was a muggy and hot afternoon. Through Mr. Lu's introduction, I was able to visit Xinhua's main studio to see the filming. That day, the fourth studio was shooting "Xiao Xiang Autumn Grievances." This film stars Chen Yunshang, Wang Yuanlong, and Hai Xi. When we arrived, they were filming a scene in Wen Yuan's home, where (played by Chen Yunshang) recognized her adoptive father. In this scene, Yunshang performs two kinds of postures, sadness and joy, and it is not easy to change between them in an instant. The performance was very natural, which was very commendable. In this scene, Miss Chen once had the line, "My father, I still don't know where he is, how can I feel at ease?" Miss Chen's pronunciation of the word "heart" was not accurate, and after guidance, although it was slightly corrected, it was still forced.</p>
<p>Originally, they were going to shoot another scene, but because Mei had not arrived, they had to stop filming, so we left the fourth studio.</p>
<p>From the fourth studio to the first studio, there was a distance in between. On both sides of the road, there were all fake houses, cloth shops, hotels, and inns, all kinds of things. From the front, they were very realistic. From behind, there were small pieces of wood crisscrossed, and I didn't know what they were. Seeing this scene, I couldn't help but laugh silently.</p>
<p>In the first studio, they were filming Gu Lanjun's "Cunning Liu Shi." The scene was in Cunning Liu Shi's room, with pearl curtains in front of the bed and bright windows. Under the window was a zither, and next to the zither was a furnace burning incense, and the smoke was fragrant and peaceful. Gu Lanjun played Cunning Liu Shi, and was playing the zither. Someone outside the room heard it and praised it repeatedly. I thought this scene must be a prelude to flirting, and the "scenery" must be "charming" when it is performed later. It's a pity I didn't have the chance to see it. The director of this play is Ma Xuweibang, who is short, stocky, and meticulous. I think "Cunning Liu Shi" will cause a sensation in Shanghai when it is released. It was getting late, so I hired a car and returned home.</p>
