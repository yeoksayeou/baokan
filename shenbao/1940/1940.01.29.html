<p>社評</p>
<h3>雅納爾大將的建議</h3>
<p>前美國亞洲艦隊司令雅納爾大將，最近對新聞記者表示完全贊成對日禁運；並主張重新劃分太平洋經濟利益範圍，由英美法荷將相當利益讓予日本，俾日本得在太平洋另獲出路以分化其在華力量；並藉以使日本國內的自由主義者因獲得對外貿易的新機會而抬頭，以阻止軍人的侵略，雅氏駐防遠東有年，夙以精通東方事件著稱，最近返國後，曾一再抨擊日本的侵略中國，並極力支持經濟制裁的提議，其主持正義的精神實為東西所共仰，此次所發表的主張當係出於同樣的動機。此外據說雅氏還曾就其竟見，草就一幅太平洋經濟劃分新圖；其內容何似，尚無所聞，因亦無從加以具體的探討。但就現勢而論，在這列強間經濟鬥爭異常尖銳迫切的今日，除非有絕對嚴重的理由，任何國家都絕不會肯從井救人，犧牲自身權益以為他國關一屬閭，所以這一建議，無寗遠是理想成分居多。考其根本認識，則大致不出下列兩個重要出發點；第一，認為日本侵華的一部份原因，實出於其自身的迫切需求，故欲令日本停止對華的侵略，必須另予日本以某種滿足；第二，日本自由主義者的勢力可以隨着對外貿易的發達而增長，所以如果在太平洋給予日本以更多的貿易機會，則必能助長自由派人士制五軍閥橫行的力量。這雖是雅氏個人的看法，却也未必不代表著美國以及其他各國一部份人士的見解。因此之故，值得加以檢討。</p>
<p>日本之侵略中國，其最有力且最動聽的飾詞，就是說日本是一個「無」的國家，更遭受人口過剩的壓迫，所以其向亞洲大陸拓展，實出於一種求生存的迫切需求。十年以來，日閥侵略的罪惡曾在這類宣傳掩護之下獲得國際上的某種諒解，同時日本國民也在這種理論麻醉之下，把對統治者的不滿轉變為對軍部侵略企圖的支持。其實所謂「無」和人口問題，在日本都只有相對的意義，中國許多地帶的人口密度還要比日本高，而且如果不是為了侵略而進行無限制的擴展軍備，也絕不致發生資源的困難，這種託詞無非是侵略者一貫的藉口而已。日本最大的問題仍舊只是日本社會自身：一方金融資本主義已有高度的發展，一方全國最大多數的農民還受着中世紀的封建榨取：輕工業雖極發達，在本國却沒有適當的市場：一般中下階級的消費能力都貧弱得異常可憐，而其足以與任何國家爭雄的棉織絲織工業基礎，又全是建立在低微不堪的工資上面；在這等予盾畸形的社會經濟結構之下，就無怪一九二九年的世界經濟恐慌繼兩年前的日本金融恐慌而發生之後，立刻就招致了日本農村和中下階級的普通困窘和破產，這也就是軍人們趁機發動對外冒論的根本原因。此其結果，冒險行動的得失如何，為別一問題，然內部困難並未因而好轉；於是只能繼續擴大其對外侵略，以轉移國內視綫。分析因果，事實如斯，這豈是區區重分太平洋經濟利益所能濟事？再就日本本身經濟發展情況來看：全國工業化的程度還很幼稚，到處小資本家都感到資本缺乏的壓迫；農業方面普遍保存着現物地租的榨取形式，因之農民遂無餘力採用近代的科學技術；此外其本國未開發的富源和待懇殖的荒地也還不少，何嘗是自身更沒有續謀發展的餘地？這些事實都證明了日閥之所以要向外去「衝」，固屬內部困難使然，但這種困難，招致了經濟更竭蹶的後果，絕對不能視經濟竭蹶為其原因；疑為經濟使然，這是因果倒置；論其真因，實屬社會的性質。</p>
<p>至於日本的貿易關係，正如上面所指出的，所患並不在國外市場的缺乏，而是國內市場的過度狹窄。產業的發展始終是畸形的偏枯的，幾個大的財閥王國壟斷着最大多數的企業，竭力抑低工資水凖，以便運用傾銷政策爭奪國外市場，結果又必然引起各國紛紛樹立關稅壁壘以為抵制。所以即使重為日貨開拓商場，也並不見得能獲得雅納爾所希冀的結果；因為即在平時，一切對外貿易的所得，也中是歸於少數財閥，並不能使中下階級獲得實利，以促進自由主義的復活；何況在戰時統制之下，經過租稅和政府的刦持，更只是資助了侵略者的軍閥。由於日本維新以來數十年間的特殊歷史演進，到現在，日本社會各階層中還缺乏一個足以阻止軍人侵略的力量存在，雖然民間不滿情緒在繼續增進中，但這一重大的歷史使命恐終非自由派人士所能勝任。</p>
<p>雅納爾提出這一建議的時節，大槪尚未看見日閥企圖併呑中國的新證據；如果曉得日閥野心。未因久戰無功無稍戢，至今還想滅亡呂國，且將藉中國作北攻蘇聯南脅英美法荷的根據地，則雅氏對於本問題當不至看得如此輕易．雅氏的用心是值得同情的，他是要在禁運的消極辦法之外，別開釜底抽薪的有效途徑；但是他的建議並不能與問題的真相適應而獲致解決。</p>
<p>今日遠東問題的根本樞紐，純粹從理論上說來，存在中日兩方，中言之，一在日本悔禍，一在中國制勝。事實上說來，除非中國獲得決定的勝利，絕不可能恢復遠東的安寗與和平，也無法解除日本所加於各國的威脅。但看美國一年前的切實抗議，半年前廢約的通知，三個月前格魯大使的警告，皆未能使日本廢然知返，幡然改圖；可知希望日本悔禍，衹是理想罷了。現在的美國與論，猶以為衹要日本改變態度。這是一個樞紐，是一個基本認識，今日　心遠東機速的人們所應該注意記取的。雅納爾大將的建議，無望於使日本轉變前進的途徑，相反的，或且使日本的傲慢野心，因此而更亢進！</p>
<h3>美政府以沈着態度　對日運用外交壓力　英美法有平行行動傾向　真理報謂美國太政策活躍</h3>
<p>華盛頓　一九一一年日美商約滿期後、美國政府昨日靜待來美國在遠東利益之外交發展、美國對日商務目前仍賡續如常，茲由各方面觀察所及、國務卿赫爾顧安坐靜待、觀察日本歧視美國在華商業會否停止、日本將對美國作何種保障、以及日本有否設法與他國通商、此間老練觀察家相信、官方對於日美商務問題、採取緩進辦法者、因官方欲避免對日採取直率挑戰、該項挑戰、或將引起日本經濟轉變、或消滅日本自由分子獲得東京領導地位之希望、圖務院方面之態度、係基於多數專家聲稱、當美國決心、一旦被日方完全承認時、日本領袖將更有多人承認與目前僵局有關之經濟困難、日本於是將接受談判、（二十八日合衆電）</p>

<p>兩性醫學</p>
<h3>男女相愛之原理生殖腺之繁榮爲最要</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊首南醫師著</p>
<p>男女相愛之原理，可說由於生理上及精神上之融合而來，如生殖機關之發育不全，則對於性慾亦失健全，生殖機能之目的，在使男子之精蟲與女子之卵子相結合，而生殖新個體，而欲達此目的，不可不借途於性慾，男女相愛之原理，即在於斯。然仔細觀察人類。性慾與生殖機關之發育，其間亦甚不調和。蓋人類之有戀愛與性慾感覺。遠在其生殖機關成熟之前，彼生育機關尚未發育成熟之兒童，對於異性，已屢屢起其戀愛之情，此即可見也。以生殖機關尚未成熟之兒童，即知戀愛異性，亦爲奇怪現象，故兒童爲手淫者，全不足怪。然與身心之健康大受影響，此由於生殖機關尚未成熟，即行性行爲所致也。</p>
<p>此外青年茍於全身發育尚未完全成熟以前，即舉行結婚，行其生殖之行爲，其結果必於身體有害，故青年求健康者不宜忽視。</p>
<p>在發育之時，茍犯手淫，或縱慾無度，則生殖搖滾大受創傷，結果遂患遺精等症，早婚亦然，此種人在正當之性生活時，病態百出，其爲吾人所常知者，即早洩，陰痿，發育不全等症均是。患此者，和好之婚姻每被破壞，故在發育時應善爲檢束，毋自放蕩，如感身體衰弱，健康水準低下，應以德國生殖腺素制劑男用「補體康」補之。蓋「補體康」之成分完全採自動物之生殖腺，用科學方法提出其精素，並摻入有益於人體之礦植物成分精製而成，具有補腦，補血，補腎，補精之功用。如因手淫斷傷，一服該劑，即可恢復原來之壯健，保證廿四小時即生精補腎，老年人服此，有返老還童之功，其女用「補體康」爲治月經不調，貧血早衰之特效良藥，實爲健康之至寶！</p>
<p>淋病春秋</p>
<h3>金錢與淋病</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌醫師述</p>
<p>淋病的猖狂，實在與經濟學上有關，所以不景氣之狂潮，捲沒了整個地面，當吾人生活正發生嚴重問題時，誰都還有能力來贍養妻子？所以在資本主義制度下，人類深深感到經濟恐慌的威脅，結婚只能讓有錢的階級所享有，廣大貧苦的大衆，對於結婚，只能認是一種特殊的權利了。</p>
<p>但在生理上無錢階級中人，與有錢階級中人，並不兩樣，他們一樣要求異性來安慰。所以宿娼成爲社會上一種普遍的現象。由宿娼而引起的淋病，也就無怪其日見流行了。根據著名學者之研究，患淋病的人不論男女，他們第一可怕的危機，便是骨膜和關節炎，這種變症，時常會使四肢殘廢，腰背佝僂，其次淋毒更進一步入骨髓，那就有頃刻暴斃之處。此外如有此引起腦脊髓膜炎異常險惡，關於淋病的治聞，據國際最著名之淋病世家柯路曼氏於一九三二年，曾有一篇馳譽世界的論文發表題爲「提供一個淋病特殊療法」除述淋病必須服用「克淋濃」外，並提出「克淋濃」乃德國彼德博士根據非特異性療法，用蛋白體黃色素混合製成，其殺菌抗淋力，可達到細胞之全部，故彌漫性之全身淋毒傳染，關節炎等，非服「克淋濃」不足以征服之，因之其他一切新舊折濁，均有待於「克淋濃」之治療，始可根治。而各國臨床室，對於淋病之用「克淋濃」，已成普遍之現象矣！余自美返國以還，以「克淋濃」治愈淋病者，不可數計，其他一切市上成藥，均被淘汰之例。</p>
<h3>痰中帶血</h3>
<p>— 盛在強醫師</p>
<p>患者王雨青，年三十三歲，安徽巢縣人，（自訴）本人好酒色，於前年冬患咳嗽之症，此時未經醫治，直至去年秋，咳嗽不止，胸感刺痛，而濃痰甚多，每於清晨，痰中帶有血點，由是憂急萬分，入夜常有盜汗。乞治云云。余觀王君熱度甚高，面色蒼白，以Ｘ光檢騐，發現右側肺葉一胡桃大小之空洞，即囑其在家靜養，攝取富有滋養之食品，並積極購服『補肺拿爾』，王君遵余言購服，結果，一月後咳嗽已止，食慾已增，二個月後，濃痰已少，盜汗已無，服至今諸症全消痰中帶血已無發現，已全身體壯茁，健康恢復矣。</p>
<h3>自凟縱慾的治騐</h3>
<p>— 姚菊岩醫師</p>
<p>患者凌其春，年二十五歲，寗波人，服務於某飯店。（自訴）因本人意志薄弱，十七歲時，已犯上手淫，久之成習，旋遺精頻繁，面色蒼白。後雙與同鄉某蕩婦私姘，致身體愈形狼狽，現雖拆離，而已罹患腎虧等病。（病象）食人呢不振，每星期有遺精三四次，頭腦朦朧，早洩，局部短小。（治法）每日電療十五分鐘，服「佈景而斯遺精片」以止遺精，並令積極購服以睾丸精質製劑「補體康」以培補虧插，而治療神經衰弱，及腎虧等症，連服一月，頓覺頭腦清爽，精神振作，遺精已止。至第二月，食慾亢進，面色紅潤，早洩絕無，至第三月，諸症全消，檢視體重，已增九磅，而勃起力強大，照理已可停服，凌君鑒於「補體康」之補力偉大，故仍續服以培補虧損，共計服半年，體重可達一百十八磅，凌君未治療前體重僅一〇一磅。</p>
<p>淋病座談</p>
<h3>如何挽治全部的尿道炎</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師撰</p>
<p>診所：寗波路九號四川路口</p>
<p>全部淋毒性尿道炎，是指淋菌已瀰漫於全部尿道，此時爲淋病患者要驅除淋毒最後之好機會。然而不幸患者既放棄此種急性淋時之前尿道炎，又未能攔截轉瞬即入內生殖器等，遂轉感可怕的變症。現在再說搆成前尿道炎之原因，成爲此症者，蓋有兩端。一爲病態的自然的發展，一爲誤被一般拙劣手術，將淋菌由前尿道帶入後尿道，逆竄各部，凡此皆爲構成全部尿道炎之條件，此所舉者，不過其大端而已。淋毒性全部尿道炎，其全部尿道，悉爲淋菌所蹂躪，故若用二杯或三杯試騐法，其前端與末端小便，（即第一杯或第二，三杯小便）皆溷濁不清。此症在許多塲所，往往有誘發攝護腺炎，故其病灶又不限於全部尿道炎也。其時患者尿意頻數，膀胱中恒有飽滿之感。而此種尿意頻數之症狀，在每次房事後尤甚。其他如在大便時，攝護腺部有壓重之感。</p>
<p>此等症狀，甚爲複雜，不能單用局部方法可以竟其全功。且非有充分經騐之醫師，必難認識與鑑別。余遇此症，恒用標本兼治法，多創奇騐，以舉世公認之炎症，一齊消滅，更用德國感應靜電療法，及抗淋血清，與Welere　X線療法，則不但殘餘之淋菌，可以肅清，且可防止淋菌而起惡化，因之自可在短期內完全根治</p>
<p>診時：上午十時至下午六時。自即日起每天送診廿號每號僅取號金五角，並贈性病全書一冊。　兼治梅毒橫痃下疳</p>

<h3>廿八年上海金融動態（下）</h3>
<p>— 朱博泉</p>
<p>本文共六節：計分（一）前言，（二）法幣發行，（三）外滙暗市，（四）儐市，金市，股市，（五）銀錢業及同業匯劃，（六）尾聲。前四節已於本刊上二期內發表，茲繼完於下。</p>
<p>五，銀錢業及同業匯劃</p>
<p>（甲）銀錢業情形</p>
<p>二十八年上半年中，滬市遊資塵壑，當時雖因國際收付逆差，去路頻繁，而銀行錢莊存款，則一般的並未減少，收付數目，亦視去年同期增加，銀行票據交換，一月份每日平均為一千萬元，二月份為一千二百萬元，三月份為一千二百五十萬元，四月份為一千五百萬元，五月份為一千四百萬元，五個月每日總平均數，為一千五百萬元，約當上年百分之二百，當二十年戰前百分之八十六。</p>
<p>六月二十一日銀錢業奉財政部馬電，於提取存款，再度加以限制，凡八一三後存入之法幣存款，每星期支取在五百元以下者，照付法幣，超過五百元者，以匯劃支付，其時銀錢業支付能力充裕，財部本旨，誠如來電所稱，「因上海競購外匯，資金逃避，亟應防止」，云云，以視八一三時施行之安定金融辦法，其中關於提存之限制，係於防止資金逃避外，兼對銀錢業加以保護者，頗有不同，即就此次提存限度觀之，較安定金融辦法規定之每週一百五十元，寬逾三倍，可以瞭然，惟外匯暗市暴縮，纔逾旬日，市民驚魂初定，喘息未蘇，突聞此舉，在謠諑紛紜中，原來可信其不必提款者，反多因謠諑而生誤會，因誤會而紛紛照限度儘量提存，加以窰藏，於是遊資充斥已久之市面，忽因提存而反奇緊，所幸銀錢業實力本極充分，故應付裕如也。</p>
<p>銀錢業目擊時艱，共謀善後，為使自身實力高度的增強，並使一般的商業信念得以早日恢復起見，決定就兩業之支付準備金加以調整，其方法為，（一）各銀行錢莊原有之匯劃獎金，一律按百分之九十五換成法幣，由準備會分十二個星期支付，錢業同業公會會員錢莊於七月四日起加入準備之交換集團，（二）由準備會收受各行莊提供之財產，供給匯劃，其總額暫定五千萬元，以上均由銀錢業聯席會議訂定各種章則，如期實行，此即「新匯劃制度」之產生也。</p>
<p>下半年中，雖暗市外匯價格兩次續跌，而市面比較的可稱平穩，銀行業票據交換六月份每日平均為一千三百余萬元，七月份為一千二百萬元，時錢莊已參加交換，故實際上減低頗多，八月以後，每月增加，八月份為一千六百萬元，九月份二千一百萬元，十月份約二千二百萬元，十一月份約二千二百萬元，十二月份約三千二百萬元，七個月每日總平均數計一千九百萬元，約當上平均數百分之二七一，當戰前平均數百分之九五。</p>
<p>一年以來，銀錢業之營業情形，因報告尚未發表，只能泛述一二，大抵銀錢業之經營方針，近來十九注重保守，本市工商業雖有繁榮之觀，而各行莊之放款與投資、類皆格外審慎，關於資金內移一點，一部份各有相當之努力與成就，銀錢業本為營利社團，但這一切業務，在營利目的以外，自有其社會目的，故資金充裕，安全為上，厚利當前，分散是務，其對存戶對顯客乃至封社會對國家之責任，視他業尤為重大，在吾國之銀錢業為尤甚，而環境艱苦，年甚一年，市面履驚，今年尤劇，差幸八一三至今兩年五個月以來，除通和一家銀行及恒隆恒異同慶等數家錢莊外，全體同業，均克穩度難關，為國家保全若干地氣，若非銀錢兩業平素培養之深沈，國結之堅厚，曷克臻此。</p>
<p>（乙）新匯劃制度之際立及銀錢票據交換之業中</p>
<p>匯劃為票據款項，在戰前除同業轉帳外，可以隔日取現，與普通票據之區別，僅在收現之為當日為隔日，八一三後，銀錢業訂定安定金融補充辦法，呈部核准施行，其中關於匯劃票據，有不得收現或購買外匯之限制，有此限制，八一三後之匯劃，乃有「對銷通訊」之性質</p>
<p>匯劃之產生，最初本出於錢莊之信用製造，其後銀行供給專用，亦常以匯劃為之，匯劃支付準備金之存欠情形，在銀行始終為主，在錢業則有存有欠。</p>
<p>新匯劃制度之施行，並非於八一三日後之匯劃性質加以變更，其最重要之特點，解言之即系銀錢業匯劃支付準備之強化，照同業匯劃領用法之規定，（一）同業匯劃以財產為準備，各行莊領用匯劃，須以領用辦法內特定之財產，繳存準備金為應保品，領用同業匯劃恕不得逾財產計價額百分之七十，（二）上述財產之檢查，計價及保管，由本市中西銀錢業代表中西各業專家擔任之。</p>
<p>吾人，訊將銀錢匯劃支付準備金之今昔作一比較，則係一　　劃支付準備金，雖係各行莊對欠款錢莊之間接放款，其最後據保，為各欠款莊之資產及股東責任，（一）現在之匯劃支付準備金，則系百分之百以上之財產為準備者也。</p>
<p>當時銀錢業因票據有時效係關，為便於商人日常之授受起見，曾擬由準備會發行匯劃證，除各莊得就原有之領用匯劃限度內領用外，準備會對於最後同業匯劃票據執票人之付款，可以匯劃證支付之，旋以（一）同業準備既經強化，預料匯劃證將受歡迎，若一般民眾，以信任法幣者信任匯劃證，紛紛加以窩藏，各行莊繳存準備金之財產，殊有呆擱之可能，豈不與準備會供給「籌碼」便利工商之旨、大相逕處、（二）匯劃證籌設之初，市上發生流通券之謠言，雖真相一明，謠傳自止，而在人心不安之當日，自以審慎為宜，故匯劃證備而未用，今後變自無發行之帶要也。</p>
<p>新匯劃制度實行後，曾照意每月舉行檢查，　經製成公告，刊載各報，茲不具資。</p>
<p>錢行聯合準備會之上海票據交換所，錢業聯合準備庫之準備總會，各爲銀行及錢莊票據之計算中心，　初清算範圍，各限於銀行或錢莊同業。至二十四年六月以後，銀行與錢莊相五問之票據款項，始　上述兩中心點分別代辦收付，但未用　錢方法為之，手錢仍不十分便利。本年七月四日起，錢業準備庫，依兩業聯席會議談論，以委託交換方式，參加上海票據交換所之交換，凡錢業公書會關錢莊四十二家，共收入交換範圍內各銀行付款票據，一律存交準備庫，準備庫轉交準備會，由準備會提出交換。交換關內各銀行收入各錢莊付款之票據，一律向準備會提出交換。銀錢兩業盼望多年之集中交換，屢次商議而迄未實行者，幸得一迫告成。</p>
<p>（丙）匯劃貼水</p>
<p>八一三後，因匯劃不能購買外匯，而其轉帳範圍·復限於本國之金融業，商人之中，漸有以營業收入之匯劃，每百元減低一二元，易取法幣，以供需要者。嗣後市上匯劃增多，而現款反感不足，於是收集法幣，買匯劃以圖利者，遂飛機而風起。上年四月，貼水行市飛漲，中中交三行委託銀行聯合準備會對銀線同業法幣需要，酌量調劑，貼水市價大見穩定，然匯劃既可調現，行之日久，取巧者日久，而資金之封鎖，因此遂有泄扈。蓋銀錢業封客之供給，本限於進口商人之真正需要，但一一欲如預期之嚴格，事實上究不可能。本年春間，貼水漸升，而掉現之幫求仍亟，在上述情形下，準備會對匯劃貼水市面今後之應否維持，實與匯兌平準備之維持外匯暗市，有了新考慮之必要者，其情形正複仿佛，五月中旬，三行與準備會曾審慎計議，擬將匯劃掉現之供給予以停止，鑒於市面人心之易受刺激，護而未行也</p>
<p>自銀錢業奉財政部令限制提存，準備會對各同業匯劃掉現之供給，乃於同時起實行停。六月二十三日，匯劃貼水暗市，暴漲至一百三十餘元，其後稍跌至百元以內，七月十四日以後，步步高升，至月感高至二百四十餘元。九月以後，逐漸回跌，十月二十七日後，盤旋於三十六元至五十元以內。年底趨勢，尤屬平強化，頗受工商業之歡迎，八一三後拒收匯劃之外商銀行中，已有因此而收受者。貼水暗市，自準備會停止供給後，其初雖因市面阢隍，投機家們得因緣為利，強事把持。而八九月以來，市民商業信念，漸漸恢復，各業人士，對非常時期內獎金封鎖之奪懿，新同業匯劃保護之穩厚，已有甚深之認識，投極者乃漸失憑藉</p>
<p>六，尾聲</p>
<p>一年來之上海金融情形，約如前述，其分段多未適當，敘述不免疎漏，雖竭力摒除主觀之論列，而信筆盡之，屢入主觀誥氣，或亦不免，殊深愧報。總之，本文關於金融各專案，連前述之稱經濟病態，擺其一，已足為專門性質之研探，請視本文為金融研究之擬題可也</p>
<h3>市場知識顧問</h3>
<p>因地位關係，本欄停止已達三期：積下問題多起，茲依次解答如後。</p>
<p>蔡吉東先生　所詢匯劃貼現原理，可讀本期所戰周夢雲先生一文。茲不復發。</p>
<p>姚士民先生　所詢「中國合作法規條例」疑問，來示內未將疑問開列，無從作答；請列示後再請專家致復。</p>
<p>陸秀川先生　所詢棉麥交易單位簡答如次</p>
<p>美棉　買賣單位為一百包，每包重五百磅。市場叫價單位為美棉一磅低美金分。</p>
<p>印棉　叫價單位為一康脫Candy，計重七百八十四磅；值為印幣羅比。</p>
<p>英棉　叫價單位為，磅值英幣便士（以上之演算法參看本刊二九一——三期）</p>
<p>美麥　坎拿大麥叫價單位為　滿什耳Busbel值美幣坎幣數。每備什耳約合〇三四〇三二一五一華石。</p>
<p>磅音　非貨幣名稱，英文為Pojnl，系小數點以後之小數，美棉叫價單位為美金分；美分系美國最小之貨幣名稱。磅音者，即不及美金一分之分數，在進位上與我國之毫相等。如跌五磅音，即等於跌美金五毫；如漲十磅音，即等於漲美金一厘，至於英棉市價中之點，意義與磅音同。英文為Decimal，即分數之意。英棉叫價單位為便士；如謂漲十九點，實即漲〇·一九便士；按分數言，約等於十六發之三便士，美幣系十進位，英幣非十進位。故一曰磅音，一曰點，以示其計算上之不同。</p>
<p>陳潔先生來函請「前讀本報鮑樂蒂君「洋米公正價不到二十元」一文，詢之上月自越南歸者，亦如是說，近來外匯轉鬆，何以本市洋米售價，猶在三十七元左右，但以第一次集團購米公佈成本價格每包為四三·八三元（合每石二五·〇六元）相較，則售價似尚平準。豈食糧販運者，利潤所得，果僅戔戔此數乎，抑鮑君計算殆有錯誤歟。請賜解釋」茲可答復者</p>
<p>洋米　價格，鮑君所計者為每百斤之價；石量爲一百六十斤；每包為一百九十八斤。故據鮑君所據之市價計算，每石約三十元強，每包約四十元弱。與目前市價相差誠然尚遠。</p>
<p>鮑君　所據者為去年七月中之仰光米價，復以十二月初之上海匯價折合；每據加費為五元，乃得每擔二十元弱之售價。四倍其加費，平心而論，不見其苛而但見其寬。</p>
<p>進口　外貨，其產地價一經外匯折合即得，　加費一層，非個中人不得而知。舉凡不公正之價格，經加費之衛護，即可恬不知羞而講之公正，且又豈僅外貨為然，內地土產之運滬，現亦無不以加費一詞彌蓋其貪慾。</p>
<h3>匯劃貼現之計算原理與珠算定位說明</h3>
<p>— 周夢雲</p>
<p>按匯劃票據貼現是申水（加水）問題，不是折扣計算。故換算法幣　，應用除法，而不用乘法。要知除的意義。一即甲數是含乙數的幾倍，一即是甲數依乙數等分。匯劃票據貼現率，以一千元為單位。「……假定現有匯劃存款一百元，依比例式計之，可得現法幣，九十三元四角五分強。而並非百元匯劃，減七元貼現為九十三元」。即一千元申水七十元。一百元申七元。每元申七分。這申水，好是貼現率。按計算原理，匯劃票據面額，即是甲數。——實數被除。（一）加貼現率，（一元〇七分）是乙數。——法數除數。除的結果，所得的商，即是匯劃票據面額內，含（一）加貼現率的倍數。故得應用公式如下：</p>
<p>匯劃票據÷（一·貼現率）＝實得現法幣</p>
<p>票據面額-實得現法費＝貼現費</p>
<p>如以例題實際數字代入，則為：$100.00÷1.07=93.45　$100.00-93.45=6.55</p>
<p>如百元匯劃減去七元貼現為九十三元。則應用公式為：</p>
<p>匯劃票據面額×貼現率＝貼現費</p>
<p>匯劃票據面額-貼現費＝實得現法幣</p>
<p>以實際數字代入簡式，則為：</p>
<p>100×70/1000＝7　100-7＝93</p>
<p>兩式相差四角五分強。前式用除，調「外貼現演算法」。後式減乘並用，稱「內貼現」算法。外貼現又為「真貼現」。即對於要求取現費日取金額以計貼現費。此法除「匯劃貼現」應用外，用者極少。內貼現即是銀行貼現。（Bank　Discount）即對於票據面額以計其貼現者，而即於票據面額內減去之為取現者實得金額。參考求本票之銀行貼現息及貼現後餘欵法即（一）求本票價值。（二）求貼現期內本票價值這銀行貼現息。（三）求本票價值減去銀行貼現及代取費後之餘款額是也。按匯劃貼現，與票據銀行貼現略有差別。故應用「外貼現」算法。</p>
<p>珠算的特長，在迅速，正確。即是見「珠」呼「訣」，隨「決」布「珠」，得數即能解決。（技術熟練，不須口呼就能得心應手）。但盤位法訣，必須熟記。假定本例匯劃一百元，貼現率為千元貼七十元。則布被除（一）於算盤左邊一樣，定第三位元空檔為原單位　。而以一〇七（一加貼現率爲一元〇七元）爲除數，置於算盤右邊檔，或默記，均可。一元〇七分的整數部份，為一位法數。即記「除法定位訣」曰「法數一位，商單位，在原單位左一位」。即在原實（一）的次位檔。（珠算定位法，詳拙作小數符號伸縮算盤說明書）。故運算的結果，即知為九十三元四角五分，尚餘八厘五毫，亦即匯劃票據一元比例法幣值得·九三四五元強。（本例應用除法撞歸訣「見一無除作九」原理，從略。</p>

<h3>糧食囤戶出籠米價稍鬆</h3>
<p>昨日米市因星期日內地來源由虹口轉出者僅南港早晚稻三百余包、惟南市亦有轉出嘉興蘆尖七十六包、而銀行棧各貨封關關係、都無出樣、故市上各貨出售者無多、同時銷場自前一度矗足後、昨則本鄉店胃均呈觀望、不敢貿然再進、所以零　去路自晨一路呆木、市面亦形平定、惟迄中市一般稱健者且見環境不佳、深恐有劇烈變化、手中囊貨多者即均趁此回出、一時回籠貨充斥、市價遂難支持、無論粳尖洋米悉貶三四角、若厚粳及特薄稻仍為四十元外、早晚稻僅售三十九元二三角至三十九元、白元供求相埒、無甚輊輊、而久巴無市之蔫尖、昨由南市轉出者開四十元五角、一號西貢開四十一元、二號西貢開三十九元五七角、東京砶尖三十七元七角至三十六元九角半、米粞三十一元三五角、經此一跌後、頗多乘廉進取、銷場又漸活繹、適將收市、更兼內地幫眾專出手暢辦、市面稍見回緊，而備貨價結果稍見回鬆一二角云。</p>

<h3>全市昨紀念一二八　情緒極悲壯肅穆　各處發現傳單詞多朂勉　租界戒備嚴密竟日無事</h3>
<p>昨日爲一二八滬戰第八週年紀念日、各界市民、一致沉痛紀念、並推進節約建國儲蓄、及春禮勞軍運動、以示擁護國策之決心、租界當局實施緊急戒備、全日秩序安謚、今日起恢復當　態、茲分誌各情如下、</p>
<p>沉痛紀念</p>
<p>本市各界、以昨日爲一二八滬戰第八週年紀念、回憶八年前日軍侵犯淞滬、十九路軍英勇將士、爲捍衛國土、首次起而奮勇抵抗、歷時三十四日、造成悲壯光榮之戰績、開民族禦侮之先聲、而奠定全面抗戰之基礎、其意義至爲重大、茲值全面抗戰繼續演進、最後勝利、爲期不遠之今日、追念當時殉國軍民、及全體抗戰將士、盜車堅擁護國策、服從領袖之決心、故各界除自動停止娛樂宴會一天、以誌衷思外、並以行動實踐紀念意義起見、各團體方面、決加緊推進節約儲蓄及春禮勞軍運動、藉以充實力量、爭取勝利、</p>
<p>發現傳單</p>
<p>昨日全市娛樂塲、如黃金大戲院·共舞台·大舞台·大世界·天蟾舞台·更新舞台·辣斐戲塲·璇宮戲塲等、均自動停止營業一天、其他如電影院·舞塲等、雖照常營業、但淸淡、昨晨五時許、南京路大新公司門前·五馬路·大世界等處、均發現五彩紀念傳單頗多、路人爭相傳誦、情緒極爲感奮、又三民主義靑年團上海支團、昨並發表告靑年書、勗勉各界靑年、務本八年前抗戰時之愛國熱忱、繼續發揚光大、爭取獨立生存、</p>
<p>各橋戒備</p>
<p>公共租界工部局警務處、爲防止不良份子乘機搗亂治安、故位於昨晨六時起、將蘇州河上之目來水橋·盆湯弄橋·新垃圾橋·實施斷絕交通、天後宮橋行人車輛、均可通行、老閘橋衹限行人、老垃圾橋衹限車輛往來、各橋均派有警備多名、在橋堍實施搜查工作、英美法意防軍及萬國商團、均奉命協助維持秩序、鐵甲車車巡隊、分作途巡弋探捕沿途搜查行人及車輛、以策安全、</p>
<p>馬路封鎖</p>
<p>兩租界除封昆連華界地段加緊防範外、並同時將愛多亞路福煦路一帶、非必要馬路如江西路·天主堂街·朱葆三路·吉祥街·紫萊橋·打狗橋·麥底安路·　坊街·東西自來火街·雲南路·廣西路·八里橋街·龍門路·貝勒路·重慶路·淡水路·呂宋路·白爾　路·慕爾鳴路·邁爾西愛路等非必要馬路、及里弄實施封鎖、僅留外灘·河南路·福建路·束新橋·大世界·成都路·同孚路·西摩路·等數口、供行人車輛往來通行、但各該口均派有大批中西探捕嚴密實施檢查、防範至爲澈底、</p>
<p>南市情况</p>
<p>一二八紀念、在南市方面交通、並無阻礙、所有法租界鐵門、亦未關閉、而南市區域因日軍將日暉港作爲天然之鴻溝、將港西置以多量之軍隊、其港東僅平蔭橋日暉橋兩處橋面通行、故特派有「憲佐」及「警察」等嚴厲搜查、而日憲兵與日警備隊、均增加出動、在斜橋·南陽橋·新橋街·新開河·等處監督「警察」嚴厲檢查入內之民眾、故南市雖無如何戒嚴令、但行動上不　無形戒嚴、</p>
<p>竟日安謐</p>
<p>昨日「一二八」紀念日、因兩租界當局、實施聯合戒備、防範極爲嚴密、故全日秩序、異常安謐、迄晚未有任何事故、據警務處消息、該項緊急戒備、將於今晨零　時起撤消、所有各處馬路交通、一律恢復原狀、惟在本月三十日前、所有各種集會、除經工部局特准者外、一律不許舉行、</p>
<h3>美艦甲蒙號　服務期滿　將以其他新艦兩艘取代</h3>
<p>美運輸艦「甲蒙」號、在遠東海面服務、行將十五載於茲、該艦於最短期內、將作最後一次行駛太平洋海面返國、由海軍部另行遣派其他艦隊前來替代、據悉、該「甲蒙」號最後一次抵達上海、在去年八月、彼係由華北秦皇島載運天津大水之難民來滬、其後該艦之行踪、曾於一月前歷經美國東綫海岸之諾萁洛克海軍船塢、甲蒙號首次來滬爲一九二七年二月二十四日、時曾載美駐滬第四海人員來滬、彼再度來滬之期、爲一九三七年九月十三日、當時載由桑狄哥來滬之海軍總指揮皮藪脫將軍來滬、航海行程、由加尼福來華、歷時僅二十一日、美運輸艦漢得遜號、於昨晨離滬返國、甲蒙號繼之亦將他調、而由共他新運輸艦兩艘接替、運同漢得遜號、共計三艘、逐月輪流在美國太平洋沿岸與遠東間航行一次、該兩新艦名稱未詳、惟悉可於來年八月中抵滬、至於漢得遜號、將於最短期內來滬、</p>
<h3>英輪被日扣阻案　英海軍正交涉　英盼日勿堅持威望　庶免事件趨於擴大</h3>
<p>美國合眾社倫敦廿八日電、此間昨晚獲悉、日本海軍最近在福州附近登臨英國商船「永生號」案、已由英國駐滬海軍當局、與日方交涉、「永生號」被日軍軍艦扣留十一小時、日本軍艦曾向該船船首開放二槍、「永生號」船主簽發文告、謂該船在抗議之下、被日方搜查、</p>
<p>上海英軍有所折衝</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社廿七日電、英國怡和公司輪船「永生」號、昨在中國福建省海面、被日本軍艦攔截盤詰、並扣留至十五小時之久、據此間外交界人士透出消息、英駐滬海軍當局、業向日方有所折衝、但截止目下爲止、英政府尚未與日政府正式交涉、</p>
<p>廣寗輪船亦曾被截</p>
<p>查英輪「文寗」號、日前在香港附近甚或在英國領海內、一度被日艦攔截、據消息靈通方面所知、英政府曾向日本駐英大使重光葵提出交涉、英官方對於此種事件、原不十分重視、但日政府對於「淺間丸」案、倘不能在合理的時期以內、予以結束、則英政府改變態度、亦屬可能、</p>
<p>英國態度息事寗人</p>
<p>要之、任何事端、凡可在英日間引起緊張局勢者、英國固願竭力避免、特日方亦須表示誠意、務勿因堅持威望或其他理由、而將事態擴大、</p>

<p>甬廠失愼</p>
<p>據昨日由甬來滬之旅客談稱、本月二十四日午、寗波江東岸之華豐紗廠、突然失愼、緣該廠資本千餘萬、爲甬埠最大之紗廠、是日因機油間失愼延燒遍及各機器間、一時火勢燎原、不可收拾、經各救火會竭力灌救、數小時後始告撲滅、聞據調查、損失至少四百餘萬元、並悉是時適有日機飛往櫟社機塲投彈、致各方誤認係日機轟炸寗波市區、本埠方面盛傳寗波大火之說、殆亦此事之誤傳、</p>

<h3>一九三九年　上海工業之回顧（三）　工部局年報之三</h3>
<p>有專製電氣開關之工廠一家，從前設於楊樹浦，規模頗大，現經移設界外馬路區域，但其範圍，業已縮小。前設於楊樹浦之電扇廠一家，將在租界內復業，大規模之新廠房，正在建築中。無綫電另件製造業發展頗速，娛樂塲所之發達，使裝置霓紅燈者日多。</p>
<p>烟酒食品業，烟草工廠在戰時受損甚重，上年有新廠兩家，曾在西區建造廠屋，其中一家，業已開工，另有大規模者一家，正在籌辦中。若干公司所製出品，包售位於較小之烟廠。新設之汽水廠及啤酒廠各一家，已經開工，前設於東區之餅乾公司一家，已在西區建廠開工，本地所製餅乾及糖果之銷路，大抵興旺。麵粉廉之產量，在年底時已見減少，其原因爲內地銷路減色；且華北運銷困難，油廠因芝麻　類及棉子等不易自內地運滬，營業較爲淸淡。茶葉於廈間有大宗出口，突然暢銷，歐戰發生以後，北非市塲斷絕，工廠　家，曾於年底因時令關係，宣告停工。</p>
<p>工作情形</p>
<p>若干工廠之內部情形，已見改善，其原因韵有數端：最重要者，厥爲廠主本身之創造力及其興趣，尤以新工廠之創辦人爲最。此輩廠主，年事方輕者頗多，曾受技術上之訓練，承襲其前輩實行改革之精神，而富有進取心。至於廠方所用機械工程師及化學工程師，曾受大學教育者，亦屬屢見不鮮，即使在規模較小之機器廠中，從前僅備一草圖者，目前恒備有準確之圖案。又如工人與監工之訓練，經認爲不可忽視。若于廠主選擇學徒時，亦往往限制其最低教育程度。再就本局工業拉而言，該科對於新工業之一切設備，愼重督察，亦爲促進改善之一法。凡工廠翻造之時，該科竭力利用此機會，使廠方在可能範圍內，提高一切設備，廠方　於此種措置，欣然合作。</p>
<p>自工業科成立至今，已有七載，其間害在改良工廠方面，悉心規劃，按違警罰法第卅三條規定，「有左列各行爲之一者，處十五日以下之拘留或十五元以下之界金。（一）違背法令章程營工商業者，」又同法第十八條規定，「勒令歇業，於累犯同一違警行爲者適用之，」工業科即根據以上兩條規定，設法使廠方遵守規章。某工廠內部擁擠，該科曾禁止其在廠內進行易生火災之工作，關於此類情形，局方並無明文限制，但法院卒受理該案。又有案件兩起，某案情牽涉局方所頒布之裝置汽壓機器規則，亦經法院承認有效。此外。尚有多種重要革新，例如八小時工作時間制，經採用者，有紗廠三家，織毯廠及芋蔴各一家，又如減少工塲之熱度與噪聲，改良宿舍設略去以及裝置煮飯汽鍋等等，均著有成效。惟戰後各工廠，大都過於擁擠，致使工人之健康與安全，均受威脅，此等工廠所能改良之處不多。</p>
<p>意外事件</p>
<p>經報告之工業上及職業上之意外事件，全年計有一·九四二起，前年計有一·五一三起。此項數字，不足表示所有意外事件之確數，因工業科自工廠方面收到之例行報告，其程序仍甚遲緩。上述之報告，大半來自捕房，救護車，及各醫院，由答醫院報告之事件，約佔百分之四十，此數恐未能包括所有經醫院施救之意外事件。至工人重傷或死亡之案件，凡五九五起，約佔總數三分之一，均經詳細調查，並飭令廠方採取適當措置，以防同樣事件之發生。因意外事件而死亡者，共一一〇人，超出以往之記錄。（一九三八年爲八八人，一九三七年七個月間爲五八人，一九三六年爲九五人。）所有　報告之事件中，工人死亡者約佔百分之五·六，比前年約增百分之〇·二。（上節完）</p>

<h3>雪之功用</h3>
<p>— 秋郞</p>
<p>歲月推遷，又屆臘底，天寒地凍，而六出花飛矣。按雪之為物，純潔皎白，象徵高人逸士，古來關於雪之故實，亦指不勝數，如袁安之臥雪，程門之立雪，謝氏之咏雪等；是其最著者，此與本刊無關，毋庸多贅，惟以雪充飲料，則殊有益，且必以臘雪（亦稱冬雪）為然，處以孤島之上，四周煤氣既烈，入冬以來，天氣又復亢旱，燥火奇重，極易發生喉症！幸前數日雪花飛舞，撲滅各種流行病菌，茍能貯雪於　，溶雪成水，隨時取出，煮沸而飲，既屬清涼，復避時疫，且於農產物亦多有利，蓋穀類荳苗等，經臘雪掩蓋，殺除　蝗，來歲必占豐收，裨益人羣，誠匪淺鮮也</p>
<p>又考本草水部臘雪條載：「臘雪密封陰處，數十年亦不壞，用水浸五穀種，則耐旱不生蟲，洒几席間，則蠅自去，掩藏一切果食不蛀蠧，又主治；「解毒，治時氣瘟疫，小兒熱癎狂啼，大人丹石發動，酒後暴熱，黃疸，小溫服之，洗目退赤，煎茶煮粥，解熱止渴，宜煎傷寒火暍之藥，扶疿亦良」。是則臘雪之功甚偉，稱曰瑞雪，亦固宜矣！</p>
<h3>亭子間裏賞梅花</h3>
<p>— 哀黎</p>
<p>徐卓呆先生說得好：上海人的家庭，大半是只有家而沒有庭的，真的，我有許多親戚朋友，都是沒有庭的家庭，你要欣賞一些花木，吸一些新鮮的空氣，休想。他們整日的擠在幾間屋子裏，沈悶得甚麼似的。像這種沒有庭的家庭，對於「衣食住行」第三項「住」的條件，還沒有完全，實在不配稱為家庭。筆者是個最愛好花木的人，在故鄉的時候，倒也有一個庭園，種着一些花木，不幸現在覊身孤島，做着中等難民，住在亭子間裏，雖然勉強還可以稱得「家」，然而也沒有「庭」了。往年在這歲尾年頭，我故鄉庭園裏的幾株梅樹都開花了，天天聞着清香，使人陶醉，而如今只聞着亭子間裏的惡濁之氣，那裏來梅花的清香，不得巳而求其次，想去買一二盆梅花的盆景來去作為案頭淸供。誰知到市上去看看，全都是縛手縛腳曲曲彎彎的病梅，實在都看不上眼，有的梅花盆景，又像是菜館中炒雜拌一樣，裝得亂七八糟的，俗不可耐，把那清高的梅花擠在裏頭，真要替梅花叫屈。擠在裏頭，所以跑了十多天，至今還沒有買到一盆。昨天訪友環龍路，道出亞爾培路，卻見三六二號一個園子裏，見有人在那裏舉行「小小梅花展覽會」，走進去參觀時，見一張板桌上，陳列着許多大大小小的梅花盆景，布置得很有章法，很有畫意，和人家雜亂無章的做法完全不同，不由得使我注意起來，一盆盆的細細地看，有一盆單種一本的，有二本或三本合種一盆的，也有松竹梅合成歲寒三友的，剪裁得很合式，位置得很適當，委實使你移動不得，欣賞了一會，見有一個花匠在旁，問是誰做的？他回說是一位孔志淸先生，我一聽之下，頓然記起秋間在中西蒔花會中曾見過他的出品，着實不錯，無怪這些梅花盆景也雅而不俗，與眾不同了。當時我細看盆上標有價目，知道是可以割愛相讓的，就買了兩盆帶回家去。家裏的人見了，也皆大歡喜，於是我這有家沒有庭的人，也居然天天在亭子間裏賞梅花了。</p>
<h3>一星期經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 葉英女士</p>
<p>前幾天本刊編者先生轉來一位　者　女士的來信，承伊稱許我的經濟菜單，說是受益非凡，真不勝慚愧之至。信中說　　新年將近，一般家庭，往往在這幾天中，先就購買魚肉等物，以免接近年關，受價格飛漲的損失，不過買來之後，不能就吃，只得　來醃，可是除了醃之外，方法很多，不知以何者為佳？以筆者的愛好來講，那麼以　和糟為最好。如猪腿醃過幾天之後，再把豆瓣醬搗爛，四面塗滿，放在陽光中晒乾就好。糟的方法比較麻煩，　如糟鷄糟肉等，須先行放在鍋中炻酥，趁熱把鹽一搽，等到冷了之後，再把老糟用溫開水溶化，（用熱水要變酸）裝在布袋中，就將這布袋放在肉和鷄上，　糟　滴下去，至於裝這　和肉的東西，必須蓋緊，那麼糟　不致外　了。　魚方法較為簡單，只須醃過一醃之後，用　　　滿就算了。</p>
<p>星期一</p>
<p>猪肉　本葱燒　魚　紅燒捲心菜　葱花　　絲</p>
<p>星期二</p>
<p>鹹白菜牛肉　紅燒鰱魚頭　雪菜豆腐　靑菜黃豆芽</p>

<h3>衣之染色問題　（下）</h3>
<p>— 天虛我生</p>
<p>建黃與建葉，夙為世重，即由其地產　，故建窯之磁，白過於贛，是陶土中含有鈷也。建藍　天然之泥，含有鈷　，非蓼藍也；靑花磁器必用碗靑，即是鈷耳。磁靑之紙，用　　　，永不褪色，亦即碗靑，天靑外套與元靑馬褂。久必發現油光，即　　化鈷本為　磁，未經燒煆而受過量之　，故不免除　性　淡之後，復受養化變酸，天靑色舊轉紅，元靑色舊轉黃，元色本為硫黃，硫化　　　天然礦產之泥也。黑衣可以藏垢納汚，故為惰性之賤役所喜；若經皂莢頻洗，則色必漸　而成　衣，故凡官府選役，可於衣色辨其勤惰，而皂衣　為僕投所利用矣。至於　　白衣，則以勤洗本色之衣，久晒所致，足見其慈母之　賢妻遞嬗，教子必有方也；故目之為俊秀之才。至於兵士之衣，舊都　色，是在山水間遠望，可不見其人也；若在近處而不見人，則宜綠色，以期　於草木山湖之間。如在沙漠之地，則宜黃色，如在　洋則　白色，外洋之沿白正以　耳；　其人種本白，是本色也。今我黃種之人，拋却本色而亦尙白，可謂盲　；然而西方之人，方以東方色彩為貴，米色紙及駝絨，我國人亦以為是西方色彩，目為時髦，誠可笑也。　　之家，嘗有字畫不古之醜陋形相，則求假作古色者以裝舊蒙門面，是故毛邊稱為官斗，是官家以為斗方者也。　面用　　壳紙，本色而非染也。洋表古號　為古而色新，偽稱為裱　　　，是欺人之不識貨耳。故我以為人心向外，從前不過為女性之由必嫁而然，今則無論男女之心，無不向外，是無怪其窮斯濫矣。為今之計，但取好惡於上之心　方法，即可轉移風俗，白為　色，本係喪服，為人所惡，黃為正色，本已推尊，公文書現猶尙黃，何必如科場卷　之誘主司醒目也耶？皆通衣色，予在兒時，多尙淺色，後乃尙灰，則　淺色復染，不能不變灰耳。故於男色加　為靑灰，女色加紅為桃灰，而豆灰鼠灰等等，則皆自然而然耳。今則新衣亦竟尙灰，是直為市儈所愚弄，返故而為新，　紙業之返故紙，即其例也。吾人昔尙儉德，一衣數傳，改長為短，由大而小，背心與套褲，皆其妙用，兒童之百衲衣，成人之孔雀衣，是真可謂物盡其用，無一廢材。今如製衣，先本色而後黃，黃而加紅成赭，赭加藍成灰，灰而染黑，則亦可以常新。惟在　時必去舊染之汚，正不必用汽油乾洗，亦不必用遭達脫脂，更不必用漂白與硫酸，但用柴灰淋汁取碱，即可脫脂。凡經脫脂，無不可用植物色素，以明礬媒染，豈必如吃　　　白塔者，肉飯不能入口也耶？上有好者，下必　焉，吾願有草上之風，一移其俗，則凡向外之人心，或可轉而向內，蓋凡此路不　，必走別路，勿令再入歧途，以取捷徑，則平平之道，亦正可以不治而平。　（完）</p>

<h3>過年何必雙料</h3>
<p>— 熾强</p>
<p>新年剛過了，却還有一個陳年，過去的是新曆年，又來的是「舊曆年關」呵！</p>
<p>面的措辭，非常好聽，呌做「春節」，這實在是對透了的。似此一來；旣無「重床疊架」之贅，而有「舊思不匱」之實。</p>
<p>有空不妨到市街上去兜個圈子，并且留意一下那些熙熙地忙錄的面孔，雜沓的脚步，以及緊張而且在盤算的心胸。兩重奏當中的後一重年曲，又洋洋乎盈耳哉了！</p>
<p>中華民國才有二十九，壯年也；過的年倒有五十八，硬巴巴拖到暮氣沉沉的地域去。陽曆照樣畫葫蘆的過了，自然頗合「陽奉」之旨；舊曆年再來一條尾巴，則亦難逃「陰違」之譏！</p>
<p>新曆年是掛國旗，放假，年輕人發賀年片，公私社團或闊人等「登報鞠躬」的過年。舊曆年是年關，是銀錢結束，老年人打躬作揖，講恭喜發財，托着各該實實的下頷而致詞曰：「你又大一歲了！」的過年。</p>
<p>這中間彷彿畫出二十九條大痕的模樣，「過新年」，「過新年」；「舊年」，「舊年」「老法過年」；年年有一次雙料的胡鬧。</p>
<p>如果說新曆年底「爆竹一聲除舊」，要等到舊曆年過了方纔「挑符萬戶更新」，則中間三四十天似新似舊的日子，將成兩重奏過年底下的渣滓了！豈非過着一些寃枉日子嗎？豈不是白白犧牲這年頭年尾而無所於歸的時光嗎？</p>
<p>這種滑稽的表演——兩重奏。社會上實在可說數見不尠，過舊曆年特其著焉者耳！一個人有這種想頭，整個社會有這種觀念，則一切將停頓在「依違皆是」，「模稜兩可」當中。</p>
<p>因此，在這新年已經過了之後，一般如白痴如瘋癲者流行將再奏一重過年之曲，敬　誠相告曰：過年何必雙料！</p>
<p>生活報告</p>
<h3>也是試車</h3>
<p>— 龍駒生</p>
<p>讀了余香芸的「試車」文後，覺得豪富人們的享福，眞是「天之驕子」了！</p>
<p>從余香芸的試車文，我頓時想到工人們也是「試車」的牛馬生活。</p>
<p>這兩年來，抗戰造成功功孤島上，托庇在外人脅下的紗布廠發財年，於是新紗廠，新布廠，像雨後春筍的風起雲湧了。</p>
<p>紗布廠開工的前奏是—試車—紡紗的程序，是淸花，鋼絲，粗紡，細紡，併紡，搖紗……男女工人，爲了生活的驅使，一天到晚，鵠立在機器旁，努力大眾衣　所需的生產工作。男工在平車，揩車，運轉（搬花）……女工在檢查紡錠，安置筒管，靜待電氣馬達發軔的皮帶轉動聲，而後忙着巡視粗紡車，或細紗車，忙着棉紗接頭（條幹工作），忙着煞車或關車，檢視有無不流暢的弊病。如果稍爲偷懶一些，給工務，管車員看到，那麼開除的處分，馬上會臨到你的頭上來，毫無通融的餘地！</p>
<p>女工們還須具有尖銳的目力，和靈緻的手足，一見紗有斷頭，立刻須趕緊接好，否則紗的條幹一亂，會愈積愈多，凌亂得如絲益棼，竟會叫你手足無措呢。她們日工十二小時的工作（夜工同），除了午餐二十分鐘外，可以說傍着機器做伴侶，沒有片刻兒獲得休息的</p>
<p>至於布機間的試車，雖然比較紡紗工作簡單些，但是一個女工，要兼管到布機三台至五台，也够辛苦的了。織布的程序，是筒子緯紗，經紗，漿紗，以至於織布，看布（整理檢查布的有無毛疵），……男工們在漿紗，搬紗，搬布，……女工們在工作緯紗，在搬取梭子，忙着經緯紗筒管的準備，放入梭子裏，靜待電氣馬達一動，於是機杼劈劈拍拍的動作了。她們管了三，五台布機，還要留心經緯的製成布的密度和梭子的不斷交替，要目不轉瞬的用盡全副精神工作，方纔不致於債事。「女工手中布，大眾身上衣，」大家讀了生意聯絡的「試車」文後，再請一讀「也是試車」，相形之下，幸福與苦惱，相差眞是何可以道里計呢。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第二十回　世界交通同文共語　兒童教育獎學憐才</p>
<p>朱愛人道：「我們去佔據他們的新房做什麼？我們不是去鬧新房嗎？」說起了鬧新房，中國向來有此習俗，而且各地都有。新娘越是怕羞的，越是鬧得厲害，這不僅是說說笑話而已，而且有的簡直是惡作劇。新郎所受的還好，新娘可說是受了虐待，受了痛苦。甚而至於闖出禍來，這實在不能算是一種好風俗。而且鬧新房還有互相報復的，你鬧了人家的新房，到你結婚時，人家也鬧你的新房了。這都因爲從前做新娘子的不給人見面，不言不笑，嬌羞滿面，人家便乘此來戲弄你了。這是中國一向對於男女交際束縛太嚴之故。從前中國年靑的婦女，不出閨門，陌生人是見也不能見一面的，出門的時候還要四圍遮蔽，這好比土耳其從前的女人，都遮着一個面巾，只露出兩隻眼睛。到後來解放了，也不見有怎樣傷風越禮的事。因爲男子與女子難得見面，趁着她新婚時候，借着鬧新房爲名，可以要求飽看一回。但是給他們看看，也就完了，偏有那些伴娘們不給他們看，那就鬧得更厲害了。到了如今，新婚是人生必要經過的階段，並沒有什麼神秘在其中。新娘子都是落落大方的，說笑依然說笑，交際還是交際，並沒有什麼羞慚的事。這個新房，也就鬧不起來了。當時經吳君素一提議，全高興到金澹雲的家裏去。只有君素的妹妹君可，她說：『我不去了。我今夜還要趁火車回去咧。』邵慧華道：『晨光還早，現在還只有九點半咧。澹雲姊的家裏，離西車站很近，停刻兒汽車送你去，不到五分鐘就到了。你趁十一點的火車也正好，不然，十二點鐘還有一趟車。或者你索性明天一早去吧。上午六點鐘，七點鐘，都有車，你學校裏要九點鐘上課，正來得及咧。』原來這時從上海到南京的京滬路，全舖了雙軌，所以每天開車的次數，比了戰前加上了一倍之多。雖加上一倍之多，但趁車的人，還是很擁擠的。因此常常有同時開出兩列車的，好在京滬路近來營業發達，車頭車輛，添置了不少，儘够供給。而近來的火車龍頭，以及客車，貨車，也都由中國自己設廠製造呢。　（二三三）</p>

<p>物質不同，比重互異，同一水也，若溫度差異，而比重且未能相等；則米旣有杜，洋之分，秈，粳之別，其比重之未必盡同，明甚。而米業糶米，小數用量，大數用衡，以品質不同比重不同之米，而固定衝之一點以合量，（以市稱一百六十斤連袋，折合市斛一石。）則其背理甚矣。自國米被阻，運輸困難，西貢洋米，及傾銷，而洋米乾燥潔凈，其經重較之國米，相差幾達什一。是則若糴洋米一石，因用衡權，實際僅量器之九斗强耳。換言之，設向米號糴國米及洋米各一斗，因用升量，其容量相等，而重量則洋米重於國米什一矣。若糴國米及洋米各一石，則用磅秤，其重量相等，而容量則洋米少於國米者幾達一斗。習慣相沿，著爲定例，然事有背理若是其甚者焉。</p>

<h3>Remnants of Japanese Army Completely Cleared Northwest of Gaoping, Chinese Army Advances on Changzhi and Huguan</h3>
<p>Xingji: The battle situation south of Changzhi is still very smooth. More than 2,000 remnants of the Japanese army who invaded the area northwest of Gaoping, including Wangpu Village, Putou Temple, and Zhuangzhen, have been completely cleared on the 21st. The Qinghua forces are launching a pincer attack north of Gaoping. The Japanese army in Niusi Village in the northern section of Baipu and Shigangkou north of Liaoxian have been attacked, suffering hundreds of casualties. The Japanese army in Heilongguan once invaded Hualuo on the 23rd, but was quickly defeated, abandoning many corpses (Dispatch of the 27th)</p>
<p>Xingji: The battle situation in Shanxi is still most intense in the southeast. After the general collapse last week, 5,000 to 6,000 Japanese troops were transferred from Changzi to join the remnants of the Japanese army in Changzhi and Changnan. The Chinese army launched a head-on attack on one side and surrounded Baodian in Changzi on the other, cutting off Japanese reinforcements. At the same time, they launched a fierce attack on Changzhi and Huguan, and once stormed into Huguan City, capturing many. Along the Changgao Highway, the Chinese army launched a continuous flanking attack at night, heading straight for Changzhi. After Gaoping was recovered by the Chinese, the outer strongholds were also successively recovered. Overall, the connection of the Japanese army in southeastern Shanxi has been divided, forming separate battles. Therefore, in the past week, they have been in an increasingly difficult situation. The northern section of the Baijin Road has been constantly attacking Japanese strongholds, destroying transportation and hindering Japanese transportation, which has been very effective. The Japanese army in southern Shanxi has repeatedly invaded Zhongtiao Mountain without success and dare not act rashly. The Chinese army west of the Qin River has repeatedly pressed on Fushan, and the Japanese are extremely panicked. The Japanese army in Yicheng has responded several times to the aid, but they have all been defeated (Dispatch of the 27th)</p>
<p>Luoyang: After the Chinese recovered Yincheng in eastern Shanxi, they continued to pursue and attack, and their momentum was like a broken bamboo. The remnants of the Japanese army have now retreated to Huguan, Maizhang, and Su Dian (west of Huguan), and a unit bypassed Changzhi and transferred to Changzi. The Chinese are still pursuing Changzhi and Huguan in separate directions (Dispatch of the 27th)</p>
<h3>Japan Blocks Tianjin Concessions, Many Obstacles for American僑民, Prices in the Concessions Increase Daily, American Chamber of Commerce to Appeal to Washington</h3>
<p>Tianjin: According to the Tianjin American Chamber of Commerce today, if the Japanese do not improve the food shortage situation around the concessions, the American Chamber of Commerce will appeal to Washington. According to the American Chamber of Commerce, the obstacles at the barrier point have greatly increased for American僑民, and many minor incidents of various natures have occurred. The Japanese side claimed yesterday that Americans carrying passes could carry food without being inspected or interfered with by the Japanese, but today the food carried was thoroughly inspected by the Japanese, and there was an attitude of not letting it go, which is obviously inconsistent with their previous statement (United Press dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The barbed wire around the British and French concessions has been energized tonight. According to the Japanese military authorities here, this move has nothing to do with any intention to tighten the blockade of the concessions. They are only restoring the situation before August 20 last year, when the current in the barbed wire was stopped due to flooding. It is rumored that the Japanese plan to tighten the blockade to retaliate against the abolition of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, and that the actions of the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin were affected by the Asama Maru incident, but both rumors have been denied by the Japanese. The Japanese had previously issued a bulletin stating that anti-Japanese elements often enter the Japanese-occupied areas from the British and French concessions through the barbed wire, so they will be energized (Reuters dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Since the Japanese energized the barbed wire around the concessions, Chinese farmers' food can still be transported into the concessions. The method is to throw the food over the barbed wire into the concessions in sections where there are no Japanese sentries. It is said that the Chinese police can allow this method without interfering (United Press dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Although there is a slight new supply of meat and vegetables in the market, prices have risen again this morning. According to vendors, this is due to the continued difficulties in imports and exports and the upcoming Chinese New Year, when demand elsewhere has also increased. A Japanese military spokesman told people last night that he was unaware of any orders to tighten border restrictions. He believed that the reduction in supplies was probably due to increased demand during the Chinese New Year (Reuters dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<h3>Chongqing Commemorates the Shanghai Battle</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Today, the "January 28th" Shanghai Battle was commemorated quietly. The National Government specially distributed food and money to the families of those fighting on the front lines today. General Zhang Zhizhong, who served as the commander of the Chinese army during the Second Shanghai Battle, gave a speech to the families of the soldiers on the front lines, asking each family to support the war for national freedom with unwavering will while their husbands or fathers were fighting on the front lines (United Press dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to news here, the members of the Sanminzhuyi Youth League took the opportunity of the eighth anniversary of the January 28th Incident to visit the families of soldiers who have gone to war, giving gifts and helping to write letters, and will also explain to them the procedures for obtaining special food certificates. Many Chinese newspapers stated that today's China will never agree to any agreement signed by the Japanese and Wang, and that the Shanghai Truce Agreement, or any other similar effort to achieve peace through compromise, will not be repeated. The "Saodang Bao" also stated that the January 28th Shanghai Battle made the Chinese believe in Japan's determination to conquer China. Therefore, China was able to make various preparations and was ready for war in 1937, and at the same time, it made the Chinese deeply believe that they could resist the Japanese army and defeat it (Reuters dispatch of the 28th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>General Yarnell's Suggestion</h3>
<p>Former commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, General Yarnell, recently told reporters that he fully supported the embargo against Japan and advocated redividing the scope of economic interests in the Pacific, with Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands giving some of their interests to Japan so that Japan could find another outlet in the Pacific to divert its forces in China. He also hoped to enable the liberals in Japan to rise up because they would obtain new opportunities for foreign trade, in order to stop the military's aggression. General Yarnell had been stationed in the Far East for many years and was known for his understanding of Eastern affairs. After returning to the country recently, he repeatedly criticized Japan's aggression against China and strongly supported the proposal of economic sanctions. His spirit of upholding justice is admired by both the East and the West. The claims he made this time were probably out of the same motives. In addition, it is said that General Yarnell also drafted a new map of the economic division of the Pacific based on his insights. The content of it is unknown, so there is no way to explore it specifically. However, in terms of the current situation, in today's era when economic struggles between the powers are extremely sharp and urgent, unless there is an absolutely serious reason, no country will ever be willing to sacrifice its own interests to help another country. Therefore, this suggestion is more of an ideal component in the end. Examining its fundamental understanding, it roughly does not go beyond the following two important starting points: First, it is believed that part of the reason for Japan's invasion of China is due to its own urgent needs, so in order to stop Japan's aggression against China, Japan must be given some satisfaction; second, the power of Japanese liberals can increase with the development of foreign trade, so if Japan is given more trade opportunities in the Pacific, it will definitely be able to help the liberals to restrain the power of the warlords. Although this is General Yarnell's personal view, it may not fail to represent the views of some people in the United States and other countries. Therefore, it is worth examining.</p>
<p>Japan's invasion of China, its most powerful and pleasant-sounding embellishment, is that Japan is a "have-not" country, and is also suffering from the pressure of overpopulation, so its expansion to the Asian continent is out of an urgent need to survive. For ten years, the crimes of Japanese aggression have gained some international understanding under the cover of this kind of propaganda, and at the same time, the Japanese people, under the anesthesia of this theory, have transformed their dissatisfaction with the rulers into support for the military's aggressive intentions. In fact, so-called "have-not" and population problems only have relative significance in Japan. The population density in many areas of China is even higher than that of Japan, and if it were not for the unlimited expansion of armaments for the sake of aggression, resource difficulties would never have occurred. This kind of excuse is nothing more than the consistent excuse of aggressors. Japan's biggest problem is still only Japan's own society: on the one hand, financial capitalism has reached a high degree of development, and on the other hand, the vast majority of farmers throughout the country are still subjected to the feudal exploitation of the Middle Ages; light industry is extremely developed, but there is no proper market in the country; the consumption capacity of the general middle and lower classes is pitifully weak, and its cotton textile and silk textile industry base, which is enough to compete with any country, is entirely based on low wages; under this kind of contradictory and deformed socio-economic structure, it is no wonder that after the world economic panic in 1929 followed the Japanese financial panic two years earlier, it immediately led to the general distress and bankruptcy of Japanese rural areas and the middle and lower classes, which is the fundamental reason why the military took the opportunity to launch external adventures. As a result, the gains and losses of adventurous actions are another matter, but internal difficulties have not improved as a result. Therefore, they can only continue to expand their external aggression in order to shift domestic attention. Analyzing the causes and effects, the facts are like this. How can this be remedied by merely redividing the economic interests in the Pacific? Looking at the economic development of Japan itself, the degree of national industrialization is still very immature, and small capitalists everywhere feel the pressure of lack of capital; in agriculture, the extractive form of rent in kind is generally preserved, so farmers have no surplus power to adopt modern science and technology; in addition, there are still many undeveloped resources and uncultivated wastelands in their own country, so how can they not have any room for continued development? These facts all prove that the reason why the Japanese warlords want to "rush" outward is indeed caused by internal difficulties, but this kind of difficulty has led to the consequence of further economic exhaustion. It is absolutely impossible to regard economic exhaustion as its cause; suspecting it is due to economics is putting the cart before the horse; when discussing its true cause, it really belongs to the nature of society.</p>
<p>As for Japan's trade relations, as pointed out above, the problem is not the lack of foreign markets, but the excessive narrowness of the domestic market. The development of industry has always been deformed and lopsided. A few large chaebol kingdoms monopolize the vast majority of enterprises, doing their best to suppress wage levels in order to use dumping policies to compete for foreign markets, and the result must inevitably lead to various countries erecting tariff barriers to resist. Therefore, even if markets are reopened for Japanese goods, it does not seem to be able to achieve the results hoped for by General Yarnell; because even in peacetime, all the income from foreign trade only goes to a few chaebols and cannot enable the middle and lower classes to obtain practical benefits in order to promote the revival of liberalism; not to mention that under wartime control, after taxes and government coercion, it only subsidizes the aggressor's military. Due to the special historical evolution of Japan in the past decades since the Meiji Restoration, there is still a lack of a force in all levels of Japanese society that is sufficient to stop the military's aggression. Although popular discontent is continuing to increase, it is feared that this major historical mission will ultimately not be able to be accomplished by liberals.</p>
<p>The time when General Yarnell made this suggestion was probably before he had seen new evidence of the Japanese warlords' attempt to annex China; if he knew the Japanese warlords' ambitions had not diminished due to the long war without success and they still wanted to destroy China, and that they would use China as a base to attack the Soviet Union in the north and threaten Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands in the south, then General Yarnell would not have seen this issue so easily. General Yarnell's intentions are worthy of sympathy. He wants to open up an effective way to draw firewood from under the cauldron in addition to the passive method of embargo; but his suggestion cannot adapt to the truth of the problem and achieve a solution.</p>
<p>The fundamental pivot of the Far East issue today, purely in theory, exists on both sides of China and Japan. In short, one is Japan's repentance, and the other is China's victory. In fact, unless China obtains a decisive victory, it is absolutely impossible to restore peace and tranquility in the Far East, nor is it possible to relieve the threat that Japan has imposed on various countries. However, looking at the United States' sincere protest a year ago, the notification of the abrogation of the treaty half a year ago, and Ambassador Grew's warning three months ago, none of them made Japan repent and change its plans; it can be seen that hoping for Japan's repentance is only an ideal. Now, U.S. public opinion still believes that as long as Japan changes its attitude. This is a pivot, a basic understanding that people who are concerned about the Far East crisis today should pay attention to and remember. General Yarnell's suggestion is hopeless in causing Japan to change its path forward; on the contrary, it may even make Japan's arrogance and ambition even more intense!</p>
<h3>U.S. Government Uses Diplomatic Pressure on Japan with a Calm Attitude, Britain, the United States, and France Tend to Take Parallel Action, Pravda Says U.S. Policy Too Active</h3>
<p>Washington: After the expiration of the 1911 U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, the U.S. government waited quietly yesterday for the diplomatic development of U.S. interests in the Far East. U.S. commercial affairs with Japan are currently continuing as usual. As observed from all aspects, Secretary of State Hull is sitting quietly and waiting to see whether Japan will stop discriminating against U.S. commercial affairs in China, what kind of guarantees Japan will make to the United States, and whether Japan is trying to trade with other countries. Experienced observers here believe that the official decision to adopt a gradual approach to the U.S.-Japan commercial affairs problem is because officials want to avoid taking a straightforward challenge to Japan. This challenge may cause Japan's economy to change or eliminate the hope of Japanese liberals gaining leadership in Tokyo. The attitude of the department of maps is based on the claim of most experts that when the U.S. determination is once fully recognized by the Japanese side, more Japanese leaders will recognize the economic difficulties related to the current stalemate. Japan will then accept negotiations (United Press dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>Washington: After the Japanese garrison authorities in Tianjin City decided to tighten the blockade of the British and French concessions, people here generally said that the continuation of the Japanese military's anti-foreign policy in China can be clearly demonstrated here. In fact, the direct reasons for the United States government's abolition of the treaty with Japan, the unanimous opposition of U.S. public opinion against Japan, and even the various proposals put forward by U.S. congressmen demanding the implementation of an embargo against Japan, are all this kind of anti-foreign policy. Although the interests of Britain and France in Tianjin are more directly threatened by this action of the Japanese side, the U.S. government believes that its own interests are also hindered by it. Therefore, it is willing to maintain a joint and progressive relationship with the other signatory countries of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty. It can be observed that there is a tendency towards parallel action with Britain and France in diplomacy. Observers also said that the parallel action of the United States, Britain, and France in the Far East has become more obvious. For example, the United States abolished the treaty with Japan so that it could impose retaliatory measures on Japan at any time. Britain made serious representations to the Eastern government because Japan did not recognize the right of British warships to intercept Japanese warships and capture enemy personnel. Although France's interests in the area of the Vietnamese border have been threatened, France still took a tough attitude towards the various demands put forward by the Japanese side for the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. All these ends, although the incidents are different, the trends are the same. People in the U.S. diplomatic circles said that the government's attitude is extremely firm. In other words, before Japan starts negotiating temporary measures or general treaties, Japan must respect U.S. interests in China. As far as the current situation is concerned, Japan has troops stationed in China, so that the interests of the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty in China cannot enjoy equal treatment in accordance with the treaty provisions (Havas dispatch of the 27th)</p>
<p>Moscow: Pravda recently published a comment on the issue of the U.S.-Japan treaty abrogation. The newspaper said, "The impact of the abrogation of the U.S.-Japan treaty is not limited to the trade relations between the two countries. The abrogation of the treaty has made it possible for the United States to exert pressure on Japan. There are two reasons for the U.S. action this time. First, the U.S. government is trying to use the current international situation and Japan's domestic difficulties to consolidate the U.S. position in China. Second, the United States intends to use the current European war to gain a more advantageous position than Britain. The United States' abrogation of the U.S.-Japan treaty and its refusal to sign a transitional agreement prove the activity of the U.S. Pacific policy. The United States now intends to use the European war to strengthen its position in the Pacific and deal with strong enemies." (TASS dispatch of the 27th)</p>
<h3>Anglo-Japanese Negotiations on the Asama Maru Incident: Conflicting Opinions, British Side Insists on International Law, Germans on Asama Maru Detained in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Regarding the Asama Maru incident, after the Japanese government issued a serious protest to Britain on the 22nd, the British government's reply arrived at the British Embassy in Japan at 10:30 AM on the 27th. British Ambassador Craig visited Japanese Foreign Minister Arita at the Foreign Minister's residence at 2:00 PM that morning, personally delivering the reply and beginning diplomatic efforts to resolve the Asama Maru incident. The meeting lasted two hours, but due to significant differences in their respective positions, the first round of negotiations ended unsuccessfully at 4:00 PM. Ambassador Craig presented Foreign Minister Arita with a lengthy response from his government, but the content was the same as the views previously expressed by Ambassador Craig, namely: (1) The inspection of the Asama Maru and the detention of the Germans on board were based on the rights of belligerent nations under international law and were perfectly legal acts; (2) The detained Germans were being repatriated by order of their government and with government funding, so it was clear that they would be immediately drafted into military service upon their return; (3) The phrase "enlisted in the enemy's armed forces" in the London Declaration would, according to the judgment of the Prize Court, be interpreted to include reservists; (4) In an organized state like Germany, detaining combatants, including reservists, and all men fit for military service was not contrary to actual practice; (5) Therefore, the detention of the Germans was believed to be a completely legal measure. The British side consistently adhered to a legalistic viewpoint to justify the legality of their search of the Asama Maru and to refuse the extradition of the Germans. Ambassador Craig also made oral representations: (1) While the inspection of the Asama Maru was a belligerent right under international law, there were shortcomings in the procedures followed, which unfortunately aroused the emotions of the Japanese people. In reality, Britain had no intention of particularly harming Japan's prestige, and hoped for understanding; (2) The Germans detained were skilled technicians in diesel engines who would be assigned to submarine crews upon their return. The British government could not stand idly by and watch such enemy nationals return home, and despite Japan's strong protests, it absolutely could not agree to extradition; (3) Regarding future guarantees, care would be taken to fully respect Japan's prestige, but the British government could not easily withdraw from its beliefs regarding international law. However, arrangements would be made to prevent the recurrence of unfortunate incidents between Britain and Japan. Foreign Minister Arita replied: (1) The differences between the Japanese and British governments' views had been stated previously, but legal arguments were secondary at this point. The search of a Japanese ship and the detention of Germans in Japanese waters, based on views different from those held by the Japanese government, had caused unprecedented anger in the Japanese government and people; (2) The Japanese people felt that the detention of the Germans was intertwined with the illegal and forceful actions of the British Navy. Therefore, it was appropriate to take a broad perspective and extradite the detained Germans to Japan, dispelling the dark clouds hanging over Anglo-Japanese relations due to the Asama Maru incident, which would be a wise move for Britain; (3) Regarding future guarantees, the Japanese government, adhering to its position of non-participation in the European war, had already considered the presence of nationals from belligerent nations on Japanese ships. The cooperation of the British government was requested on this point. As a result, Japanese and American opinions remained divergent, and it was agreed to continue negotiations. The meeting then ended. (Kyodo News, 28th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Anti-British sentiment is spreading among the masses in Osaka, Kobe, Kyushu, and other cities, protesting the British Navy's unauthorized seizure of twenty-one Germans on the "Asama Maru". At the same time, Japanese newspapers are also advocating a firm stance against Britain. The Asahi Shimbun stated that the Foreign Ministry would certainly reject the British reply, reiterate its protests, and insist that the Japanese Navy must adopt a vigilant stance to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents. It also stated that Japan's attitude must not only be firm and resolute, but if necessary, it would not hesitate to resort to force. (United Press, 28th)</p>

<h3>Joint US Army and Navy Exercise: Weaknesses Discovered in Caribbean Sea Defenses</h3>
<p>New York: The United States Army and Navy are jointly conducting exercises in the Caribbean Sea to test the effectiveness of newly established naval bases in the Caribbean Sea in defending the Atlantic coast and the Panama Canal. The New York Times recently reported that the exercises have revealed several weaknesses that will be remedied immediately. In the exercises, the army forces acting as the aggressor consisted of 15,000 personnel, supported by two cruisers, seven torpedo boats, one aircraft carrier, and eight transport ships. They landed on the island of Puerto Rico under aerial bombardment and held the island for two days before being driven back by mobilized reserve forces. This shows that the defenses are not yet complete and need to be strengthened. (Havas, 28th)</p>

<h3>Uruguay Feels British Economic Pressure</h3>
<p>Montevideo: "El Diario", a very influential newspaper published here, published an editorial this morning stating that Britain should end its pressure on Uruguay's domestic production. The newspaper pointed out that Britain has a plan to gradually use the opportunity of blocking German exports to eliminate all peacetime business competition, which is very harmful to Uruguay. The cost of Uruguay's purchases of foreign goods has increased by 50% compared to the past, while the value of its sales has decreased by less than 10%. The difference between income and expenditure is too great. The only solution is for South American countries to form an organization to share sales, so that rights and interests will not be lost.

<h3>Germany Launches Diplomatic Offensive in Balkans: Targeting Romanian Oil as Main Goal, Urging Balkan Countries to Trade with Germany</h3>
<p>London: It has been learned here that German newspapers are now issuing news and editorials on Germany's battle in the Balkans in the form of propaganda. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Southern Capital City: It has been learned from reliable sources that the Balkan Entente Conference is scheduled to open here on February 2nd. The schedule is as follows: Greek Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Metaxas, accompanied by Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu, are scheduled to arrive in the Southern Capital City on the morning of February 2nd by the Orient Express. Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu will also arrive here by special train on the same day. The first meeting will be held that day at the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry. Prince Regent Paul of Yugoslavia will separately receive the foreign ministers of the four countries. On the afternoon of February 3rd, Prince Regent Paul will host a banquet for the foreign ministers of various countries. On the evening of the 3rd, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković will host a banquet. The conference is scheduled to end on the 4th. On the afternoon of the 4th, a joint press conference will be held, and after the report is issued, the three foreign ministers of Greece, Turkey, and Romania will return to their respective countries that evening. (Haitong Telegraph, 28th)</p>
<p>London: British newspapers are closely monitoring the issue of Germany taking military action in the Balkan Peninsula to seize oil produced by Romania, but their interpretations are inconsistent. The "Sunday Times" believes that if Germany expands the scope of the war to Southeastern Europe, its defensive position on the Western Front will be seriously affected, and there will inevitably be various difficulties in transportation. Other newspapers believe that Germany's attack on the Balkan Peninsula is inevitable. The "Observer" also reported that Romania and its oil production will become Germany's main target, because the Germans firmly believe that their lifeline is not on the Rhine but on the Danube, and it is expected that they cannot forget their Eastern policy. According to a dispatch from the newspaper's correspondent in Rome, German economic expert Clodius went to Italy yesterday, and his purpose was to find a solution for a certain outstanding issue between Italy and Germany, so that it would not cause opposition from Italy if Germany had an incident in Romania in the future. "The People's News" reported that Hitler is now attempting to intimidate various neutral countries again, and the threats that Romania, Hungary, and Yugoslavia are about to suffer will be no different from those suffered by Austria, which may be a prelude to Germany's military offensive. However, before launching this intimidation campaign, Hitler must wait for Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to give a reply agreeing not to interfere before he can let go and do it. In general, the plan that Hitler put forward to Italy is as follows: (1) Germany's expansion of power in the Balkan Peninsula will not hinder Italy's interests; (2) If Soviet troops advance further into the Balkan Peninsula, Germany will also advance at the same time to divide its power; (3) If Italy has an incident in the future, Germany should promise to provide full military assistance, but does not require Italy to assist Germany during the current war as an exchange condition; (4) After Germany wins in the future, it should cede all of North Africa to Italy. In addition, "The Reynolds News" reported that the Balkan Entente's Standing Political Conference is about to open. Hitler is likely to take diplomatic action against the conference, on the one hand, forcing Turkey to abandon England and France, and on the other hand, urging the Balkan Entente countries to trade with Germany, thereby weakening the power of England and France in that region. (Chavas Telegraph, 28th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German military newspaper has denied the reports from England and France that German troops have entered Galicia. Local newspapers reported that the German authorities denied a week ago that the Soviet government had ceded Galicia in exchange for Germany's assistance in the Soviet-Finnish war. British newspapers then published news that German troops had indeed entered Galicia, apparently with the intention of influencing Romania. German political figures pointed out that 60,000 Germans in eastern Galicia moved to Germany in January, and this relocation is still ongoing, which is clear evidence that Germany has no intention of occupying Galicia. "Abendpost" reported that the political authorities of the Balkan countries must be happy to hear that the panic caused by the news from England and France has no factual basis. "Berliner Börsen-Zeitung" reported that the British government is trying to fabricate the illusion that Germany is threatening Romania to influence Romania's oil policy and disrupt German-Romanian business relations. (Haitong Telegraph, 28th)</p>
<p>Rome: The Standing Political Conference of the Balkan Entente countries is scheduled to be held on February 2nd in the capital of Yugoslavia. According to well-informed sources, the Entente countries are unanimous in their opinion that they must continue to maintain neutrality, jointly maintain peace and maintain the status quo in Southeastern Europe, and carry out constructive cooperation with their neighbors in peace. This can be asserted. The most important issue in the Balkan Peninsula was originally the territorial demands made by Hungary and Bulgaria to the Entente countries, but as of now, the threat posed to the countries of Southeastern Europe by the new Berlin-Moscow axis has taken a backseat. In addition, Italy's every move is extremely important. The country has stated that it will do its best to maintain peace in the Balkan Peninsula and is willing to encourage all actions that can effectively ease the mutual relations between the countries of the Balkan Peninsula. At the same time, Bulgarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Koseivanov has also firmly stated that while the country does not want to make things difficult for its neighbors, all these two statements have been welcomed by the countries of the Balkan Peninsula. As for Hungary, the country is located between the three powers of Germany, the Soviet Union, and Italy, so it has to take a wait-and-see attitude. Since Soviet troops arrived in southern Poland and approached its border, its relations with Romania have eased slightly, but it may not have abandoned its territorial claims (Romania's outer Transylvania province belonged to Hungary before the last European war). Its Foreign Minister Csáky is scheduled to give a speech to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives on the 30th of this month, at which time he may explain the country's views on the issue of expanding the scope of the Balkan Entente and having Hungary participate, but this is a major matter, and it may not be possible to realize it in a short period of time.

<p>Rome: After the establishment of the National Petroleum Committee, the government recently appointed Professor Naida, Secretary-General of the Ministry of Economy, as chairman. Professor Naida used to be a director of the Peninsular Agency Lador News Agency. (Havas Telegraph, 28th)</p>
<p>London: The Sunday Times recently published an article discussing Romania's recent adjustments to its oil production methods, stating that Romania is currently being demanded oil production by Germany, threatened by the Soviet Union, Bulgaria wants Southern Dobruja, Hungary wants Transylvania, and Italy wants to acquire considerable power, so the plight of its politicians is comparable to any other country in Europe. The difficulty of the current oil production situation lies in whether Romania can allow Germany to obtain the agreed 1.5 million tons without infringing on the oil production of companies operated by Allied capital. Germany may attempt to force Romania to hand over this oil production, but the Allied countries that guarantee its integrity and supply its national defense equipment cannot allow their capital to solve the major difficulties encountered in German military supplies. It is still difficult to say whether Germany will threaten Romania with war-like actions in order to seize all of its oil production, but even if it does, due to the difficulties in transportation, it may not be of much help to the Western Front. It is estimated that Germany used about 8 million tons of oil annually in peacetime, so even if Germany can satisfy its desires in Romania, its domestic oil production cannot maintain its peacetime quantity, and it is feared that there will still be a shortage. According to military estimates, the need for oil in modern countries during wartime needs to be increased two or three times compared to peacetime. The article concluded that we cannot underestimate Germany's ability to launch an attack, but there is reason to suspect that the reason why Germany has been slow to take the offensive is that it fears that if it fails, all of its stored oil will be used up, causing its entire war machine to stall.

<h3>Italy Restricts Food Purchases: Cabinet Member Publishes Article Explaining Reasons for Restrictions</h3>
<p>Rome: Cabinet member of Non-Essential Departments, and former Secretary of the Fascist Party, Farinacci, recently published an article in the "Fascist Political System Newspaper" explaining the reasons for Italy's implementation of purchase restrictions. He stated, "The German people have been filling their stomachs with black bread and potatoes for the past five years," which can be a model for our people. It must be known that the implementation of purchase restrictions is the foundation of economic mobilization and national mobilization. The government is expanding armaments at the greatest speed and organizing economic resistance, and taking this step is a reasonable move. Our people are accustomed to this kind of measure by the government and will certainly trust and willingly follow it, which is no different from the spirit of our soldiers defending the borders for months. (Chavas Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<p>Rome: The Italian Party authorities have previously implemented purchase restrictions on coffee and sugar. Everyone rushes to stores to buy various daily necessities as a precaution. The authorities should take appropriate measures to prevent this. The newspapers still say that Italy's production is abundant and sufficient to meet normal needs, and that the people do not need to hoard food. "Stampa" reported that Italy is the country with the most abundant food in Europe, regardless of whether it is a belligerent country or not, and there is still a surplus that can be exported to foreign countries, with a value of hundreds of millions of lire. As for the current situation of Italy's textile industry, it is also satisfactory. "No matter how things change in the future, the Italian people will have no shortage of food and clothing."

<h3>Hungarian National Bank Adjusts Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>Budapest – The Hungarian National Bank recently reduced the exchange rate between the Hungarian pengő and the U.S. dollar to the level before the last European war, in order to adjust the exchange rate between the pengő and the currencies of various countries, with the German mark being the most important.  From now on, the exchange rate of the mark against the pengő can be increased by 6 to 10 percent.  Regarding this matter, Germany raised this requirement during recent economic negotiations between Germany and Hungary.  According to a communiqué issued by the Hungarian National Bank, the government's adoption of this measure is a necessary action in extraordinary times, but it will not hinder the country's import and export trade in any way.

<h3>Japanese Spies Appear in Annam; Soviet Magazine Comments on Relations Between Japan and Annam</h3>
<p>Moscow – The latest issue of the Soviet publication "World Economics and Politics" published an article on the relationship between Japan and Annam, stating that Annam is France's most important colony and its third largest market, as well as a base for France in the Pacific. Annam is rich in raw materials, especially food. Japan's ambition to meddle has not been a recent development. Japan is ambitious and seeks to dominate East Asia, and occupying Annam is naturally part of its plan. At present, the northern and western parts of Annam have been threatened by Japan. Since Japan occupied Hainan Island, the situation has become even more tense. Japan is still active on the border of Annam and is now working hard to attempt to invade Annam, and has sent many spies there to carry out activities. Japan plans to first deploy in the northern, western, and coastal areas. Once the deployment is complete, the occupation of Annam will be as easy as turning one's hand. (28th)</p>

<h3>British Government to Control All National Mail Ships; Conscription to Begin on February 1; Two More French Ships Attacked</h3>
<p>London – Starting on the first day of next month, any British mail ship registered in the United Kingdom and its colonies, once it arrives at any port in the empire and unloads passengers and cargo, will be requisitioned by the government. Minister of Shipping, Gilmour, recently made a statement to a reporter from The Observer on this matter, saying that by that time, all British mail ships will be under national control. During the last European war, our country did not achieve this until 1917, three years after the start of the war. Now, we have been able to do it in less than half a year, which is gratifying. Moreover, the cooperation between the British and French maritime authorities is very close. In addition to the French Minister of Shipping, Le Rivoire, being here to talk with our authorities, the French government has also sent representatives permanently stationed in London to maintain contact.

<h3>Soviet Forces Intensively Attack Northern Finland; Restraining and Encircling Finnish Troops at Kylmalahti; Soviet Planes Bomb Cities in Northern Finland</h3>
<p>Helsinki – The General Headquarters recently issued a battle report stating: (1) The front line in the Terijoki Isthmus was quieter today than before. Patrol units from our side and the enemy engaged in encounters. Our forces captured one Red Army officer and many soldiers. (2) Northeast of Lake Ladoga, Red Army forces attacked our positions in certain locations, but were repelled. Several units were completely annihilated, and our forces seized a large quantity of military supplies. (3) Soviet planes flew to northern parts of our country today and bombed various cities. Details of the damage are not yet available. Our forces shot down a total of three enemy planes. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>Helsinki – Judging from last night's communiqué, although there are approximately 200,000 Soviet troops north of Lake Ladoga attempting to flank the Mannerheim Line for a week, it is the Finnish army that still controls the battle situation there. This fact has repeatedly proven that winning with fewer troops depends on strategy. The Soviet offensive has been deterred by the most courageous Finnish troops, such as the suicide squads. It is said that although the Soviet troops are mostly new recruits and well-equipped, they have suffered heavy losses. People are eagerly awaiting news about the fate of the Soviet troops besieged around Kylmalahti. Approximately three to four Soviet divisions are stationed there. Finnish suicide patrol teams, together with the Finnish Air Force, have cut off their rear lines of communication, causing them to be in a difficult situation. Soviet forces in the north are launching fierce attacks in order to restrain the Finnish troops surrounding the Soviet troops at Kylmalahti. Public opinion suggests that some of the besieged Soviet troops may have broken out and escaped. Last night's Finnish communiqué stated that a Soviet submarine sank in a Finnish minefield. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Stockholm – It is reported that the Soviet troops currently on the front lines in northern Finland are superior to those who fought at the beginning of the war. It is estimated here that there are 50,000 Soviet troops in the trenches in the Salla area. It is reported that the Finnish advance in the far north has recently slowed down because General Stern has taken over military authority there and has improved the organization of the Soviet troops. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Paris – Intelligence received by military circles in Paris indicates that Finnish forces destroyed 400 Soviet supply trucks near the area where a large number of Soviet troops have been trapped for many days.

<p>Moscow – Regarding the award of medals to Red Army officers and soldiers for their achievements in the fighting in Finland, the Red Star newspaper recently published a commentary stating, "In view of the heroic fighting of the Soviet army, the propaganda experts of British and French imperialism can only fabricate rumors of Finnish victories to console themselves. At present, countless Red Army officers and soldiers have been awarded medals for their achievements in fighting the Finnish self-defense forces in Finland. This fully proves the absurdity of the rumors in the cafes of Paris and London. The Red Army is fully implementing its international mission in accordance with the people's orders, and nothing can hinder the victory and achievements of socialism." (TASS, 28th)</p>
<p>London – A Reuters military correspondent telegraphed that the reported visit of Marshal Voroshilov, the Soviet Defense Commissar, to the Finnish front lines is of great significance. Voroshilov is Stalin's closest confidant. Even during the most intense purges of the army, he still maintained some contact between the various chaotic armies. Voroshilov is now the Supreme Commander of the Soviet Army, Navy, and Air Force. This trip to Leningrad may be aimed at adjusting the three services and continuing military operations.

<h3>Canadian Election Begins</h3>
<p>Ottawa – After the Canadian Federal House of Commons was ordered to be dissolved, the government has set March 26 of this year as the date for re-election. Prime Minister Mackenzie King recently delivered a speech yesterday, starting the election campaign, briefly stating that his primary responsibility now is to fight the war abroad. He and his cabinet members must pay attention to official business, so they have to reduce their election activities to a minimum. The new House of Commons will not be formally established until April 25 at the earliest. In addition, although the officers and soldiers of the Canadian Expeditionary Force's first division are stationed in Europe, they will still vote as usual at that time. The list of candidates from all parties will be telegraphed to those officers and soldiers, and their ballots must be sealed and transported back here before they can be revealed. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<h3>Reopening of the German-Belgian Border</h3>
<p>Eupen – The Hotset area of the German-Belgian border has been reopened today. Once the snow is cleared, the tram from Eupen to Köpfchen on the German border will operate as usual, and pedestrians will also be able to cross the border. However, vehicles entering Germany must follow the road from Liège to La Calamine. The current situation has returned to the state before the tense period. It is reported that the Belgian government had previously heard that Germany had deployed troops on the Belgian border as a precautionary measure, causing the situation to suddenly become tense.

<h3>Palestine Receives Jewish Refugees</h3>
<p>Rome – 725 German Jewish refugees have been transported by Greek ships to Palestine in recent days. People in Haifa believe that although these Jews have not obtained permission to enter the country, they will temporarily stay in Palestine, residing in barracks along the coast south of Haifa.

<h3>French Military Writer Predicts German Strategy; Germany Has Abandoned Invasion of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Italy; Will Seek to Break Through the Maginot Line</h3>
<p>Brussels – The famous French military writer General Duval recently gave a speech here, believing that Germany has likely abandoned its plan to "win by surprise." He said that the country is unlikely to invade Belgium and the Netherlands in the future, nor will it take any action in Scandinavia or the Balkan Peninsula, in order to complete its "great roundabout strategy." Instead, it will directly attack France between the Rhine and the IJssel rivers. He anticipates that the tactical characteristic to be adopted at that time will be to use heavy tanks weighing 80 to 100 tons to break through the French Maginot Line under the cover of large numbers of aircraft and heavy artillery. Then, the army units now concentrated along the North Sea coast and near the Belgian border will use this breakthrough point to attack the French mainland. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>Observers Comment on the Situation, Anticipating Changes in the War</p>
<p>London – First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill's speech has recently been commented on by foreign observers here, humorously saying that although Britain and France are tightening their economic control over Germany, their current defensive stance in military terms is not a fixed strategy. This has been expressed for the first time by responsible personnel of the British government. This can be seen in Churchill's statement that "Britain does not intend to sit and wait for the enemy to attack permanently. We hope that Hitler will one day be in a position of waiting, and will be anxious because he does not know when we will attack him." It can be seen from this that many celebrities in Britain have recently advocated adopting an "offensive strategy." For example, former Conservative Colonial Secretary Amery said that Britain should change from defense to offense and strike Germany in the air. The famous writer Wells, although he has repeatedly attacked so-called pacifism, has recently returned to his original position and has gone even further than Amery, advocating bombing Berlin. However, among the responsible personnel of the British government, First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill is the foremost. As for why Britain and France have not done much in the purely offensive aspect, there are two reasons that have been explained by Churchill. Germany was already ready before the outbreak of the war, and Britain and France rushed to catch up after the start of the war in order to organize production, which caused the war to slow down. This is one reason. In the air force, Britain and France are unwilling to initiate a destructive war for moral reasons. This is the second reason. Now, the aircraft manufacturing industries of Britain and France are making daily progress, and it will be easier to attack Germany's various military targets, defensive strongholds, transportation routes, and its remaining foreign commerce. In addition, in the economic war, in addition to the current blockade measures, other methods can be used to weaken Germany's power. This is something that can be done very well as the military strength of Britain and France increases day by day, which goes without saying. As for strategy, there are certain military and geographical issues that cannot be considered for the time being. However, it is also true that there are many points in Germany that are vulnerable and susceptible to attack, which cannot be discerned by simply looking at the Siegfried Line. As the strength of Britain and France increases day by day, there may be new developments in the war situation in the coming weeks. This can be seen in First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill's statement that "At this moment, in addition to showing endurance, we must also display a spirit of boldness." (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>Allied Forces Reach a Total of Ten Million Troops</p>
<p>London – The Sunday Dispatch today wrote an article praising France's war efforts, first stating that the troops commanded by the Allied Supreme Commander will outnumber Hitler. "As far as Germany is concerned, according to general estimates, by the spring of this year, the country's army will reach approximately five million troops, of which 30 percent are new recruits whose training is not yet complete. Another one million troops must be stationed in Poland, the Czech Republic, and Austria, and cannot be transferred to the Western Front. Once all five million troops have completed their training by the end of the summer of this year, Hitler plans to continue to conscript 2.5 million troops into the army. Therefore, by the end of 1940, the German army will increase to 7.5 million troops. On the Allied side, the French army has 6.5 million troops, and the British have 3.5 million troops, for a total of ten million troops, which is a quarter more than the German army."</p>
<h3>Artillery War on the Western Front; Snow is Gradually Melting; All Infantry Activity Has Ceased</h3>
<p>Paris – In recent weeks, the snow has been gradually melting, and the activities of patrol teams and other infantry have completely ceased. However, the artillery units are more active, especially not far from Luxembourg and east of the Moselle River and east of the Vosges Mountains. The guns of the Maginot and Siegfried Lines are bombarding each other along both banks of the Rhine River. Aerial activity has almost completely ceased. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Berlin – According to a report from a correspondent of the German News Agency, German reconnaissance teams captured several head of cattle that France sent out between the German and French army positions to reconnoiter German minefields. It is claimed that the area is "no man's land." France released cattle in order to test where mines were buried. After discovering the activity of these cattle, the German reconnaissance team captured them all. (Haitong News Agency, 28th)</p>

<h3>Lin Zhiyuan Regrets His Crimes After Being Captured; Huang Dawei Also Detained by the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: Lin Zhiyuan, who led the Chaoshan puppet army to invade Zhao'an in the Fujian province, has been taken back to the headquarters by Chief of Staff XXX of the XXth Army Group Headquarters after being arrested in Raoping. When Lin was escorted from Raoping, he knew that his crimes were obvious and that he would inevitably die. He regretted his erroneous behavior at the beginning, which led to his current predicament. He personally wrote a letter and printed it to send to the puppet troops scattered in Raoping and Chenghai, advising them to repent and surrender. The original letter said, "To all officers and soldiers of the 'Peace and National Construction Army': This invasion of Zhao'an is acting as a tool for the enemy, which is extremely meaningless. Even if we are lucky enough to occupy it temporarily, it will only be expanding the enemy's territory and killing each other. How can it benefit the country and the nation? I have strongly advised against it beforehand, as everyone knows. Unfortunately, Huang Dawei could not accept my opinion due to personal biases. Now that we have failed to this point, why should we continue to resist and cause more casualties? What is the way out? I ask you all to value your lives and surrender as soon as possible to avoid being killed. I am waiting for punishment here. You were misled for a moment, and there is no serious crime. If you can abandon the darkness and surrender, you will surely be pardoned by the central government. I hope you will hand in your weapons upon receipt of this letter and await resettlement. Do not make any more mistakes," and so on. It is reported that after this letter was sent out, a group of puppet troops (mostly from Jiangsu and Zhejiang) who were scattered in the mountains on the border of Fujian and Guangdong surrendered and were sent to a certain place for reorganization. As for Huang Dawei himself, he was dissatisfied with the fact that the Japanese garrison commander in Shantou, Ando, did not move his troops. After returning to Shantou, he was detained by Ando. Cheng Wanjun was appointed to control the puppet army. Recently, 3,000 puppet troops were transferred from Shanghai and Guangzhou and concentrated in Chenghai. They have been very busy with deployments in recent days and have ordered the villages to conscript laborers for use, claiming that they will invade Huanggang Zhao'an again within a month. According to general speculation, the puppet army suffered heavy losses in the last invasion of Zhao'an. This wild claim to invade is nothing more than an attempt to cover up their defeat. Since the Chinese army in that area has long had careful arrangements and deployed heavy troops, it is impossible for the puppet army to cross the line. In addition, on January 2, Pingtan County in eastern Fujian (i.e., Haitan Island) was raided by Hua Yu'a Huang's bandit gang, who fled to the small islands in the Bai Da Ocean to make a living by intercepting passing ships. However, the main traitors, Lin Shaoping and Weng Shanggong, were transferred to Xiamen by the Japanese for training, so they were missed in the roundup. Now the county magistrate, Luo Zhongruo, has returned to his post to deal with the aftermath, and local order is gradually being restored.</p>
<h3>The Bandit Disaster in Fujian is Completely Eradicated. The Bandit Suppression Headquarters Has Handled Local Post-War Affairs. Security Brigade Commander Chen Peiyu Suddenly Shot and Killed by Bandits.</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Regarding the military situation of bandit suppression in central Fujian, after Zhang Xiongnan was killed at Duitingge Mountain in Dehua, his subordinates Zhang Kewu, Zhang Chengfu, Wu Junchang, and Zhou Gonghui, all submitted their firearms and requested to reform. More than 40 groups of bandits, large and small, in Dehua, Datian, Xianyou, Yongtai, and other counties, also surrendered to the county government one after another, awaiting disposition. The mountains and ridges in various counties of central Fujian are overlapping, with precipitous cliffs and dense forests, which can be the lair of bandits everywhere. For more than 20 years, it has become a bandit-infested area. This time, it has been eradicated, which is a great fortunate event during the Anti-Japanese War. Currently, the Bandit Suppression Headquarters in central Fujian has begun to handle local post-war affairs. There are two important matters: (1) to appease the good people in the bandit areas of various counties; (2) to offer rewards for excavating buried bandit guns. Regarding the appeasement of good people, Zhang Xiongnan has been entrenched in central Fujian for more than ten years, creating a local evil force. Many people have been coerced to obey him, causing good people to be displaced and their fields and houses to be destroyed. It is truly heartbreaking. This time, the chief culprit was beheaded. It is especially hoped that the government will be magnanimous and treat those who were coerced to follow as if they were reforming themselves. For those who have been displaced, methods will be devised to appease them. All counties have been ordered to earnestly publicize this intention, especially in remote areas with low levels of public awareness, so that they can understand right and wrong and all be able to turn to good. Regarding the excavation of bandit guns, the reward methods are stipulated as follows: (1) Excavate a complete factory-made rifle, reward 10 yuan; (2) Light machine gun, 100 yuan; Mauser pistol, 20 yuan for ten rounds, 30 yuan for twenty rounds, 40 yuan for submachine gun. Government and military personnel who surrendered after joining the bandits, in addition to completely surrendering their own firearms, can receive double the reward if they can report the whereabouts of other bandits' hidden guns and thus excavate them. However, at this time of great victory in bandit suppression in central Fujian, an unfortunate incident suddenly occurred in western Fujian, that is, Chen Peiyu, the commander of the Security █ Brigade, was shot and killed by three thugs in Longyan on the evening of January 2. The murderers have not yet been apprehended, and the reason is also unclear. The provincial government granted 2,000 yuan for funeral expenses, and Yan Zeyuan, deputy director of the Security Department, was temporarily appointed to fill the vacancy. It is found that Chen is 42 years old this year and is from Nan'an County, southern Fujian. Since the seventh year of the Republic of China, he has successively served as company, battalion, and regimental commander of the Jingguo Army, the Bandit Suppression Army, the Provincial Defense Army, and the Security Corps. In the winter of the 25th year of the Republic of China, he was transferred to his current position and concurrently served as the commander of the Qingxiang in Yongde Da and northern and western Fujian. This time, he was transferred to Longyan to take charge of the defense of Yan (Longyan), Hang (Shanghang), Wu (Wuping), and the Zhang areas. Unexpectedly, he was suddenly shot and killed, and the military and political authorities were deeply shocked.</p>
<h3>Disorder in Suzhou City; Robberies Occur Repeatedly in the City</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: Although the appearance of this county town seems to be gradually returning to its former appearance, in reality it is still extremely dilapidated. Moreover, since all daily necessities are under the control of the Japanese, prices have soared several times. Since the beginning of winter, there have been several robbery cases in urban and rural areas every day. In the urban area, from the 16th to the 21st, incidents occurred successively in Tonghefang, West Street, Shuiguan Bridge, Dingxiang Lane, Pingjiang Road, and other places. In just one week, there were as many as eight incidents. Even busy streets could not be avoided. Most of the robbers were armed. The Japanese puppet military and police were unable to maintain order, resulting in extremely chaotic order in the city. In previous years, near the Lunar New Year, farmers from the surrounding villages all came to the city to purchase New Year's goods. All industries in the urban area were thriving. Now, however, there is unrest everywhere, so they dare not come forward, resulting in the current commercial situation being far worse than in the past.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Puppets in Jiangyin Incite Anti-British Sentiment Extremely Fiercely; Sale of British Goods and Cigarettes is Prohibited</h3>
<p>Changyinsha Correspondence: The Japanese puppets in Jiangyin City, affected by the assassination of Yang Shoutong, the puppet magistrate of Wuxi, are all uneasy. Originally, outside the north and south city gates, several Japanese soldiers were killed by guerrillas before and after the end of the lunar year, which already showed signs of unrest. Now, it is even more shaken.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a "Youth Anti-British Sports Meeting" in Jiangyin, which was organized under the urging of the Japanese. It specifically investigates and prohibits the sale of Hongxibao, Daying Brand, and cigarettes sold in various cigarette and paper shops in the market. Existing inventory must be stamped before being sold. The deadline is set for the 20th of this month. If British goods or cigarettes are sold again, they will all be confiscated.</p>
<h3>The Price of Rice in Dinghai Continues to Rise; Each Dan Costs More Than Thirty Yuan</h3>
<p>Dinghai Correspondence: This county does not produce much rice. The people's food needs have always relied on imports from neighboring counties. Since the fall of Yunian County, the shipping routes between Yong and Ding have been cut off, and external assistance has been suspended. Moreover, due to the control of the Japanese and the manipulation and monopoly of unscrupulous merchants and gentry, the price of rice has soared. Recently, the price of ordinary white rice has reached between 30 and 34 yuan in national currency per dan. The common people are complaining endlessly, and the poor are taking risks, resulting in frequent theft cases in urban and rural areas. Now, some people are discussing jointly establishing a public sale to stabilize prices. However, most of the unscrupulous gentry are only interested in profit, so they have not yet raised funds to implement it. Complaints are boiling in the city, and the people are struggling to survive. Only the villages in the suburbs of the city, such as Cengang, Yancang, Ziwei, Ma'ao, Xiaosha, Baiquan, Ganxian, and Dazhan on Zhoushan Island, have relatively stable rice prices due to the effective control of the county government. Each yuan can buy more than seven sheng of rice. In the western villages, due to this year's bumper harvest, it can buy up to eight and a half sheng. The common people can still barely maintain.</p>
<p>Medical Science of Sexuality</p>
<h3>The Most Important Principle of Love Between Men and Women is the Prosperity of the Gonads</h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. Yang Shounan, a graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University</p>
<p>The principle of love between men and women can be said to come from the physiological and spiritual integration. If the reproductive organs are not fully developed, the desire for sex will also be unsound. The purpose of reproductive function is to combine the sperm of a man with the egg of a woman to reproduce a new individual. To achieve this goal, one must use sexual desire. The principle of love between men and women lies in this. However, careful observation of human beings shows that there is also a great disharmony between sexual desire and the development of reproductive organs. The feeling of love and sexual desire in humans is far before the maturity of their reproductive organs. Children whose reproductive organs have not yet matured have repeatedly developed love for the opposite sex. This can be seen. It is also a strange phenomenon that children whose reproductive organs have not yet matured know how to love the opposite sex, so it is not surprising that children masturbate. However, their physical and mental health is greatly affected. This is because the reproductive organs have not yet matured, and they engage in sexual behavior.</p>
<p>In addition, if young people get married and engage in reproductive behavior before their overall development is fully mature, the result will definitely be harmful to their bodies. Therefore, young people who seek health should not ignore this.</p>
<p>During development, if one commits masturbation or excessive indulgence, the reproductive organs will be greatly injured, and as a result, they will suffer from nocturnal emission and other symptoms. Early marriage is also the same. Such people experience all kinds of illnesses during normal sexual life. What we often know is that premature ejaculation, impotence, and underdevelopment are all symptoms. Those who suffer from this have their harmonious marriages often broken. Therefore, one should restrain themselves well during development and not be licentious. If you feel weak and have a low health level, you should supplement it with "Butikan," a German gonadal hormone preparation for men. The ingredients of "Butikan" are completely extracted from the gonads of animals. Its essence is extracted by scientific methods, and it is refined by mixing mineral and plant ingredients that are beneficial to the human body. It has the functions of nourishing the brain, nourishing blood, nourishing the kidneys, and nourishing essence. If you are injured by masturbation, one dose of the drug can restore your original strength. It guarantees to generate essence and nourish the kidneys in 24 hours. Elderly people who take this will have the effect of returning to youth. Its female "Butikan" is an effective medicine for irregular menstruation, anemia, and premature aging. It is truly a treasure of health!</p>
<p>A History of Gonorrhea</p>
<h3>Money and Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Narrated by Dr. Huang Zhongchang, Doctor of Medicine in the United States</p>
<p>The rampant spread of gonorrhea is indeed related to economics. Therefore, the tide of recession has swept across the entire ground. When people are experiencing serious problems in their lives, who still has the ability to support their wives? Therefore, under the capitalist system, human beings deeply feel the threat of economic panic. Marriage can only be enjoyed by the wealthy class. For the vast majority of poor people, marriage can only be regarded as a special right.</p>
<p>However, there is no difference between the poor and the rich in terms of physiology. They all require the comfort of the opposite sex. Therefore, prostitution has become a common phenomenon in society. It is no wonder that gonorrhea, which is caused by prostitution, is becoming more and more popular. According to the research of famous scholars, the first terrible crisis for people suffering from gonorrhea, whether men or women, is periostitis and arthritis. This kind of metastasis often causes the limbs to become disabled and the waist and back to become hunched. Secondly, if the gonorrhea toxin further enters the bone marrow, there is a possibility of sudden death at any moment. In addition, if this causes meningitis, it is extremely dangerous. Regarding the treatment of gonorrhea, according to Dr. Colman, the most famous gonorrhea family in the world, in 1932, he published a world-renowned paper entitled "Providing a Special Therapy for Gonorrhea." In addition to stating that gonorrhea must be taken with "Kelinong," he also pointed out that "Kelinong" is a mixture of proteid pigments made by Dr. Peter of Germany based on non-specific therapy. Its bactericidal and anti-gonorrhea power can reach all cells, so diffuse systemic gonorrhea infection, arthritis, etc., can only be conquered by taking "Kelinong." Therefore, all other old and new turbidity can only be completely cured with the treatment of "Kelinong." And the use of "Kelinong" for gonorrhea has become a common phenomenon in clinical laboratories in various countries! Since returning to China from the United States, I have cured countless people with "Kelinong." All other over-the-counter medicines on the market have been eliminated.</p>
<h3>Blood in Sputum</h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>The patient, Wang Yuqing, is 33 years old and from Chaoxian County, Anhui. (He complained) that he likes wine and women, and suffered from cough two years ago. At this time, he did not seek medical treatment. Until last autumn, the cough did not stop, and he felt a stabbing pain in his chest, and there was a lot of thick sputum. Every morning, there were blood spots in the sputum, so he was very worried and anxious, and often had night sweats at night. He begged for treatment. I observed that Mr. Wang had a high fever and a pale complexion. An X-ray examination revealed a walnut-sized cavity in the right lung lobe. I immediately told him to rest at home, take nutritious foods, and actively purchase and take "Bufei Naer." Mr. Wang followed my advice and purchased and took it. As a result, the cough stopped after one month, and his appetite increased. After two months, the thick sputum was reduced, and the night sweats were gone. After taking it until now, all the symptoms have disappeared, and there is no blood in the sputum. His body is strong and healthy, and his health has recovered.</p>
<h3>A Cure for Self-Pollution and Indulgence</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>The patient, Ling Qichun, is 25 years old and from Ningbo. He works in a hotel. (He complained) that because he is weak-willed, he started masturbating at the age of seventeen. Over time, it became a habit, and he frequently had nocturnal emissions and a pale complexion. Later, he had a private affair with a promiscuous woman from the same hometown, which made his body even more embarrassed. Although he has separated now, he has already suffered from kidney deficiency and other diseases. (Symptoms) Poor appetite, nocturnal emission three or four times a week, hazy mind, premature ejaculation, and small local area. (Treatment method) Daily electrotherapy for 15 minutes, taking "Bujinger Si Nocturnal Emission Pills" to stop nocturnal emission, and actively purchasing and taking "Butikan," a testicular essence preparation, to cultivate and supplement deficiencies and treat neurasthenia and kidney deficiency. After taking it for one month, he immediately felt his mind clear and his spirits lifted, and the nocturnal emission stopped. By the second month, his appetite was increased, his complexion was ruddy, and there was no premature ejaculation. By the third month, all the symptoms disappeared. When he checked his weight, he had gained nine pounds, and his erection power was strong. In theory, he could stop taking it. Mr. Ling appreciated the great tonic power of "Butikan," so he continued to take it to cultivate and supplement the losses. He took it for a total of half a year, and his weight reached 118 pounds. Mr. Ling's weight was only 101 pounds before treatment.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Forum</p>
<h3>How to Cure the Entire Urethritis</h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, at the intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Total gonococcal urethritis refers to the fact that gonococci have spread throughout the entire urethra. At this time, it is the last good opportunity for gonorrhea patients to eliminate gonococci. Unfortunately, patients have given up this acute gonorrhea of the anterior urethra and failed to intercept it before it quickly enters the internal reproductive organs, resulting in terrible complications. Now, let's talk about the reasons that constitute anterior urethritis. There are two reasons for becoming this disease. One is the natural development of the disease, and the other is the mistaken transfer of gonococci from the anterior urethra to the posterior urethra by general inferior surgery, which reversely invades various parts. All of these are conditions that constitute total urethritis. What is mentioned here is only the general outline. In gonococcal total urethritis, the entire urethra is ravaged by gonococci, so if the two-cup or three-cup test method is used, the front and end urine (i.e., the first or second and third cup of urine) are all turbid and unclear. This disease often induces prostatitis in many places, so its focus is not limited to total urethritis. At that time, the patient has frequent urination and always has a feeling of fullness in the bladder. And this symptom of frequent urination is especially severe after each sexual intercourse. Others, such as a feeling of pressure in the prostate during bowel movements.</p>
<p>These symptoms are very complicated and cannot be completely successful with local methods alone. And it is difficult to recognize and distinguish without a doctor with sufficient experience. I always use the method of treating both the symptoms and the root cause for this disease, and I have created many miracles to eliminate the world-recognized inflammation. I also use German induced static electricity therapy and anti-gonorrhea serum, and Welere X-ray therapy, which can not only eliminate the remaining gonococci, but also prevent the deterioration caused by gonococci. Therefore, it can be completely cured in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Consultation hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. From today, 20 consultations will be sent out every day, and each consultation will only cost 5 jiao, and a complete book on venereal diseases will be given as a gift. Also treats syphilis, lymphogranuloma venereum, and chancroid</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Education Consults Sichuan Province to Improve Social Education; Social Education Funds Must Account for 20%</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airlines News) The Ministry of Education attaches great importance to social education in Sichuan. Previously, it sent social education supervisors to inspect social education in various places in western and southern Sichuan. There were many opinions on improvement. After the Ministry of Education approved it, it consulted the Sichuan Provincial Government to make improvements. The main points of Sichuan Province's social education improvement are disclosed as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Matters that should be coordinated and improved by the Provincial Government's Department of Education</p>
<p>(1) The social education funds in Sichuan Province have not yet reached 10% of the total provincial education funds, and the social education funds in various counties have mostly not reached the prescribed standards. They should immediately comply with the order of the National Government on October 8, 17, and earnestly raise funds to ensure that they reach the prescribed 20% of the total education funds within one or two years to facilitate the development of the cause.</p>
<p>(2) It is found that there is only one provincial public education hall in Sichuan Province. According to the Department of Education, it is planned to add 15 more within three years, starting from the 29th year, distributed in various administrative inspectorate areas. If this plan is to be fully realized, then the funds should be generously raised, and the talents should be effectively trained. Regarding the generous fundraising, we should try our best to find ways from the existing tax sources, and at the same time, we should pay attention to the completion of land reporting and the thorough reorganization of land taxes. After increasing tax revenue, we should clearly define the proportion and allocate assistance separately. Regarding talent training, the Social Education Department of Sichuan Provincial Education Institute should concentrate human and financial resources to engage in research and experimentation in public education halls, effectively guide students, and participate in work, so as to unite social education administration and talent training, so that people can be employed and talents can be used to their full potential.</p>
<p>(3) The funding for popularizing civil education in various counties ranges from 10,000 yuan to 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. However, as of June, only a few counties can fully allocate and use them. Most counties either have not approved the local budget, or are afraid that tax revenue will not be sufficient, and have been delayed in spending them, or because of emerging businesses, there is no funding, and they are reduced and misappropriated to make up for it. If this is delayed and reduced, the adult illiterate people's literacy education will not be able to be promoted, let alone popularized. The counties should immediately be ordered that this funding should not be reduced at will, and that they should do their best to handle the adult illiterate people's literacy education. As for the civil education funds that have not been used in previous years and have been included in the accumulated surplus, the counties should still be ordered to use them for handling the adult illiterate people's literacy education, so that the adult illiterate people's literacy education can be rapidly popularized.</p>
<p>(4) Although there is fixed funding for the popularization of adult illiterate people's literacy education in various counties, most do not have a sound plan, resulting in delays, reductions, and slow progress. The counties should be ordered to prepare implementation plans separately and supervise their operation.</p>
<p>(5) Social military training is being widely implemented in various counties. Wartime civil literacy education can be carried out in conjunction with this organization to stimulate the national consciousness of the trainees and supplement their knowledge of life, and the effectiveness can be particularly significant.</p>
<p>(6) Most of the directors of the public education halls in various counties have not received professional training, and the qualifications of the staff are even lower. Those who teach in civil schools do not know the correct teaching methods, those who manage books do not know how to catalog and classify, those who manage livelihood education do not have production knowledge, and those who manage sports do not know the layout of the venue and the rules of the competition. In addition, the director's monthly salary is mostly no more than 40 yuan, and the minimum is only 20 yuan. The staff's salary is mostly no more than 20 yuan, and the minimum is less than 10 yuan. With such meager treatment, it is difficult to attract talents. In the future, it should be appropriately increased, and more opportunities for training and further study should be given. Those with poor academic experience and performance should be eliminated separately to facilitate the development of the cause.</p>
<p>(7) Many counties employ full-time teachers in public schools, but their treatment is at most paid for ten months a year, or only eight months. Their service time is often only half a year. In the future, the selection of teachers for civil schools should be carefully selected, paid for twelve months a year, the number of teaching periods should be increased, and various simple social education undertakings should also be carried out in accordance with Article 23 of the Ministry-promulgated Regulations on Public Schools.</p>
<p>(8) In addition to cultivating elementary school teachers, county normal schools in various counties should also pay attention to the training of public school teachers. Each school should be equipped with a complete public school for students to practice. Graduates of normal schools who work in elementary schools will have the ability to concurrently handle social education.</p>
<p>(9) Middle and elementary schools in various counties have not made much effort to concurrently handle social education. They should be supervised to handle it earnestly, and supervision and inspection should be strictly implemented to achieve success.</p>
<p>2. Matters that should be transferred to various counties and cities for separate handling (omitted)</p>

<h3>Inter-Port Football Trial Match: Ideal Wins Over Potential; Four to Two, One Goal Each in the First Half; Each Player's Performance Extremely Brilliant</h3>
<p>The inter-port football trial match between the Ideal team and the Potential team took place yesterday morning at the Recreation Ground. All of Shanghai's elite Chinese and Western football players gathered for the selection of the inter-port team, each displaying their skills, and the brilliance was naturally expected. Yesterday morning, each player's performance was perfect, making it the first beautiful football performance of the season. As a result, although the Potential team lost to the Ideal team by a score of two to four, the excellence of the Potential team members' performance was no less than that of the Ideal team. The first half ended in a one-to-one tie. The official inter-port lineup still awaits formal approval from the Westerners' association. Yesterday happened to be the anniversary of the January 28th Incident, which greatly affected the fans, with only about two to three thousand people attending. The players were exactly as announced in yesterday's newspaper.</p>
<p>Ideal Team</p>
<p>Willie Watt (Western Police)</p>
<p>Haile Selassie (Eastern Silk) Carroll (Western Forsythe)</p>
<p>Jim Watt (French Business) Li Yichen (Lido) Kola Sha (Portugal)</p>
<p>Cao Qiuting (Lido) Sun Jinshun (Lido) Laobastoff (French Business) Xu Wenkui (Lido) Pile (Western Forsythe)</p>
<p>Potential Team</p>
<p>Kabutuo (St. Francis)</p>
<p>Zhuang Youren (Tung Wah) Ke Lai Tuo (French Army)</p>
<p>Grimbert (St. Francis) Costas (Portugal) Sigren (French Business)</p>
<p>Carlo Liequ (St. Francis) Luo Chailiao (Portugal) Cochrane (Northwest Sacred) McLard (Eastern Silk) Fuen (St. Francis)</p>
<p>(Excellent in Both Offense and Defense) Yesterday's performance had its own merits. In terms of defense, the Ideal team was flawless, definitely better than the Potential team in many ways. In the first half, the Potential team's fierce attacks repeatedly failed to break through, precisely because of this. Goalkeeper Willie Watt's saves were particularly ingenious, earning him applause from the entire field. The two fullbacks, especially Mail, were slightly inferior. The center midfielder, Li Yichen, was no weaker than Costas. The Potential team's defeat was due to their inferior defense. Kabutuo's goalkeeping was the biggest failure. As for the forwards, they were evenly matched. In the first half, the Potential team's five forwards were active and formidable, controlling the situation. Unfortunately, with a steel gate in front, their attacks repeatedly hit a wall. In the second half, the Ideal team's five forwards gradually cooperated, and their offense became stronger. The blonde Laobastoff was particularly dangerous, scoring a hat-trick and proving to be the ideal center forward. The right winger, Fuen, seemed better than the Ideal team's Pile, as his iron-leg performance was much improved compared to the past. Cao and Xu, the two forwards, were also very competent.</p>
<p>One Goal Each</p>
<p>The Ideal team kicked off and attacked first. Costas intercepted Fuen's pass and advanced along the side. Haile Selassie lost his footing, and Willie Watt kicked the ball out. The Ideal team launched a counterattack. Li Yichen took a free kick from twenty yards away from the goal, but it flew over the bar. Kabutuo kicked the ball out not far, and Kola Sha intercepted it and passed it to the center, from the center to the left. Qiuting made a clever pass in front of the goal. Kabutuo touched it on the ground, saving it but failing to prevent it from slipping into the goal. Only three minutes after the kickoff, the Ideal team had already taken the lead. The Potential team counterattacked, and their momentum was very strong. For the next thirty minutes, it was almost entirely the world of the Potential team's five tigers' activity. The five forwards cooperated seamlessly. Fuen and McLard were especially likable, moving step by step, like machines. Unfortunately, Willie Watt was unbreakable, wasting their efforts. But after thirty minutes of fierce attacks, the Potential team finally broke through and scored. The one who made the contribution was Fuen. After achieving a tie, the Potential team's offense did not diminish slightly. Three minutes later, Cochrane broke in alone and rushed to the front of the goal. Willie Watt tried to save and fell to the ground, with his legs in the air. The opportunity was excellent, but Cochrane did not score, allowing Willie to punch the ball out. What a pity, what a pity. The Ideal team's five forwards gradually became active. Sun Jinshun and Xu Jiaokui both had wonderful shots but failed to hit the target. McLard's powerful shot hit the post and bounced back, which was also a wonderful move. In the last five minutes of the first half, McLard rushed into the penalty area and lifted his foot to shoot, touching Jim Watt's hand. It was clearly a penalty, but the referee Karna showed leniency and placed the ball outside the white line, changing it to a free kick. The Ideal team finally escaped danger because of this. Karna's cleverness was also wonderful. The first half ended in a one-to-one tie. (Final Victory) After switching sides, the Ideal team's five forwards, who were initially out of sync, gradually cooperated better, and the situation changed dramatically. Kabutuo was very busy for a while. Costas marked the blonde, staying close by. But at eight minutes, he was careless for a moment, and Laobastoff was like a horse off its leash, rushing in. The Ideal team took the lead. At twenty-five minutes, Li Yichen lobbed the ball to the blonde, and Laobastoff completed his hat-trick, scoring again. The Potential team seemed to be losing momentum. But in just one minute, McLard broke in alone, and the ball hit the goalpost and bounced back. Willie rushed out too late, and Cochrane tapped it in. The score became three to two, and the situation became tense again. For the next twenty minutes, both sides had chances but failed to succeed. Until the last minute, Qiu Heng took a corner kick, and the landing point was excellent. The blonde jumped up and headed the ball in again. By the time the center line was kicked off, the whistle had already blown. The final score was four to two.</p>
<h3>Changes in the Inter-Port Football Hong Kong Team Roster</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong team, which will participate in the Hong Kong-Shanghai inter-port football competition during the Spring Festival in Shanghai, is scheduled to depart from Hong Kong on March 3rd or 4th. According to a United Press report, the Hong Kong team going to Shanghai for the inter-port match has been reduced from fifteen to thirteen players. The final decision on the team members was made on the evening of the 24th, and the lineup has been slightly changed, reducing the number of players by two compared to the original plan. Only three military personnel were selected. However, the most disappointing thing is that Sheehan of Middlesbrough and "Head Horse" Fula will not be coming, further weakening the strength of the Hong Kong team. The current final roster of the Hong Kong team is: goalkeeper Moss Ham (military), defenders Da Shidulanqi, Bowen, center midfielders Xia Xian, Hua Lu, Gan (military), Xiao Shidulanqi, Mai Shihui, forwards Da Gaoshan Nu, Jia Sidelu, Li Anna, Mai Yiyun, He Xi (military), Han Nibulu. This is the final decided roster.</p>
<h3>Lido and Tung Wah Lose in Yesterday's Reserve Team Football Matches</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in two reserve team football matches in Jiaozhou Park, the two heroes of the Chinese team, Lido and Tung Wah, both lost. Lido's players were either sick or injured, so they could not resist the pressure from Eastern Silk, suffering a惨败 (can bai) of 0-2, conceding one goal in each half. Tung Wah lost to St. Francis by an even greater score (2-5). Lido, after this惨败 (can bai), now has the same points as Eastern Silk, and their hopes for the championship are still very high.

<p>Economic Special Issue, No. 305</p>
<h3>Shanghai Financial Dynamics in the 28th Year (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhu Boquan</p>
<p>This article has six sections: (1) Introduction, (2) Issuance of Legal Tender, (3) Black Market Exchange Rates, (4) Pawn Market, Gold Market, Stock Market, (5) Banking and Money Shop Industry and Interbank Transfers, (6) Conclusion. The first four sections have been published in the previous two issues of this publication, and the following is the continuation.</p>
<p>5. Banking and Money Shop Industry and Interbank Transfers</p>
<p>(A) Situation of the Banking and Money Shop Industry</p>
<p>In the first half of the 28th year, there was abundant floating capital in Shanghai. Although the international balance of payments deficit led to frequent outflows, the deposits in banks and money shops generally did not decrease. The number of receipts and payments also increased compared to the same period last year. The daily average of bank clearing of notes was 10 million yuan in January, 12 million yuan in February, 12.5 million yuan in March, 15 million yuan in April, and 14 million yuan in May. The total daily average for the five months was 15 million yuan, about 200% of the previous year and 86% of the pre-war level in the 20th year.</p>
<p>On June 21, the banking and money shop industry received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance, further restricting the withdrawal of deposits. For legal tender deposits made after August 13th, those withdrawing less than 500 yuan per week would be paid in legal tender, and those exceeding 500 yuan would be paid by transfer. At that time, the banking and money shop industry had sufficient payment capacity. The original intention of the Ministry of Finance was, as stated in the telegram, "to prevent the escape of funds due to the competition for foreign exchange in Shanghai." This differed from the financial stabilization measures implemented during the August 13th Incident, which, in addition to preventing the escape of funds, also aimed to protect the banking and money shop industry. This could be seen from the withdrawal limit, which was more than three times wider than the 150 yuan per week stipulated in the financial stabilization measures. However, the black market for foreign exchange contracted sharply. Just over ten days after the citizens had barely recovered from their shock, they suddenly heard of this measure. Amidst rumors, those who originally believed that there was no need to withdraw funds instead misunderstood due to the rumors and rushed to withdraw and hoard funds to the maximum extent allowed. As a result, the market, which had long been flooded with floating capital, suddenly became unusually tight due to the withdrawals. Fortunately, the banking and money shop industry was inherently strong, so it was able to cope with ease.</p>
<p>Witnessing the difficulties of the times, the banking and money shop industry jointly sought solutions. In order to enhance its own strength to a high degree and to restore general commercial confidence as soon as possible, it was decided to adjust the payment reserve of the two industries. The methods were as follows: (1) The original transfer bonus of each bank and money shop would be converted into legal tender at 95%, and the reserve association would pay it in twelve weeks. Money shops that were members of the money shop industry association would join the reserve exchange group from July 4th. (2) The reserve association would receive the property provided by each bank and money shop and supply it for transfer, with the total amount provisionally set at 50 million yuan. The above were all stipulated in various regulations by the joint meeting of the banking and money shop industry and implemented as scheduled. This was the birth of the "new transfer system."</p>
<p>In the second half of the year, although the black market foreign exchange rate continued to fall twice, the market was relatively stable. The daily average of bank clearing of notes in June was more than 13 million yuan, and in July it was 12 million yuan. At this time, money shops had already participated in the clearing, so the actual reduction was quite large. After August, the amount increased every month: 16 million yuan in August, 21 million yuan in September, about 22 million yuan in October, about 22 million yuan in November, and about 32 million yuan in December. The total daily average for the seven months was 19 million yuan, about 271% of the previous average and 95% of the pre-war average.</p>
<p>Regarding the business situation of the banking and money shop industry over the past year, because the report has not yet been published, only a few general remarks can be made. In general, the management policy of the banking and money shop industry has recently focused on conservatism. Although the local industry and commerce have a prosperous appearance, the loans and investments of each bank and money shop are all particularly cautious. Regarding the internal transfer of funds, some have made considerable efforts and achievements. The banking and money shop industry is inherently a profit-making organization, but these businesses have social purposes in addition to profit-making purposes. Therefore, sufficient funds and safety are paramount, and when high profits are present, diversification is necessary. Their responsibility to depositors, to distinguished customers, to society, and to the country is more important than that of other industries, especially in our country's banking and money shop industry. The environment is difficult, and the year is even worse than the previous year. The market is frequently shocked, and this year is particularly severe. Fortunately, in the two years and five months since August 13th, except for the Tonghe Bank and several money shops such as Henglong, Hengyi, and Tongqing, all of our colleagues have been able to overcome the difficulties and preserve some of the nation's vitality. If it were not for the deep cultivation and strong national ties of the banking and money shop industry, how could this have been achieved?</p>
<p>(B) Establishment of the New Transfer System and the Banking and Money Shop Note Exchange Industry</p>
<p>Before the war, transfers were for note payments. Apart from interbank transfers, they could be cashed the next day. The difference between them and ordinary notes was only that the cashing was on the same day or the next day. After August 13th, the banking and money shop industry formulated supplementary measures for financial stabilization and submitted them to the Ministry for approval and implementation. Among them, transfer notes were restricted from being cashed or used to purchase foreign exchange. With this restriction, transfers after August 13th had the nature of "offsetting correspondence."</p>
<p>The creation of transfers initially came from the credit creation of money shops. Later, banks also provided them for special use, often using transfers. The status of transfer payment reserves, in terms of deposits and debts, was always mainly in banks, while in money shops, there were both deposits and debts.</p>
<p>The implementation of the new transfer system did not change the nature of transfers after August 13th. Its most important feature, in short, was the strengthening of the transfer payment reserves of the banking and money shop industry. According to the regulations on the usage of interbank transfers: (1) Interbank transfers are backed by property. Each bank and money shop must deposit the specified property in the usage methods as collateral when using transfers. The interbank transfer limit must not exceed 70% of the assessed value of the property. (2) The inspection, valuation, and safekeeping of the aforementioned property are handled by experts from Chinese and Western banks and money shops in the city.</p>
<p>If we compare the past and present of the transfer payment reserves of the banking and money shop industry, we see that although the transfer payment reserves were indirect loans from each bank and money shop to the indebted money shops, the ultimate security was the assets and shareholder responsibilities of each indebted shop. (1) The current transfer payment reserves are 100% or more backed by property.</p>
<p>At that time, the banking and money shop industry, considering the time-sensitive nature of notes, intended to issue transfer certificates to facilitate the daily transactions of merchants. In addition to each shop being able to use them within its original transfer limit, the reserve association could pay the final note holder of interbank transfer notes with transfer certificates. However, (1) since the interbank reserves had been strengthened, it was expected that the transfer certificates would be popular. If the general public trusted the transfer certificates as much as they trusted legal tender and hoarded them, the property deposited by each bank and money shop as reserves might be stuck. Wouldn't this be completely contrary to the purpose of the reserve association providing "chips" to facilitate industry and commerce? (2) At the beginning of the planning of transfer certificates, there were rumors of circulating notes on the market. Although the truth became clear and the rumors stopped, prudence was still advisable on that day when people's hearts were uneasy. Therefore, the transfer certificates were prepared but not used, and there was no need to issue them in the future.</p>
<p>After the implementation of the new transfer system, inspections were conducted monthly as intended, and announcements were made in various newspapers, which are not listed here.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Note Exchange, which is the Qianhang Joint Reserve Association, and the Reserve General Association, which is the Qianye Joint Reserve Treasury, are each the calculation center for bank and money shop notes. Initially, the clearing scope was limited to banks or money shops. Until after June of the 24th year, the note payments between banks and money shops were handled separately by the aforementioned two centers, but the handling method was not convenient enough. From July 4th of this year, the Money Shop Reserve Treasury, in accordance with the discussions of the joint meeting of the two industries, participated in the exchange of the Shanghai Note Exchange in the form of entrusted exchange. All 42 money shops that were members of the Qianye Gongshu Association deposited the bank payment notes received into the reserve treasury, which in turn transferred them to the reserve association, which then submitted them for exchange. All bank payment notes received by the banks within the exchange from the money shops were submitted to the reserve association for exchange. The centralized exchange that the banking and money shop industry had been hoping for for many years, and which had been discussed many times but had not been implemented, was fortunately achieved at once.</p>
<p>(C) Transfer Discount</p>
<p>After August 13th, because transfers could not be used to purchase foreign exchange, and their transfer scope was limited to the domestic financial industry, some merchants gradually reduced the value of transfers from their business income by one or two yuan per hundred yuan to obtain legal tender for their needs. Later, as the number of transfers on the market increased and cash became insufficient, those who collected legal tender and bought transfers to make a profit suddenly became popular. In April of last year, the discount rate soared. The Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Bank of China entrusted the Bank United Reserve Association to moderately regulate the legal tender needs of the Yin Qian (Banking and Money Shop) industry. The discount market price greatly stabilized. However, since transfers could be cashed, and as time went on, those who took advantage of it became more numerous, and the blockade of funds therefore had leaks. The supply of Yin Qian (Banking and Money Shop) to customers was originally limited to the real needs of importers, but it was impossible to be as strict as expected in practice. This spring, the discount gradually increased, and the demand for cash withdrawals was still urgent. Under the aforementioned circumstances, the Reserve Association had to reconsider whether to maintain the transfer discount market in the future, just like maintaining the foreign exchange leveling reserve in the black market for foreign exchange. The situation was exactly the same. In mid-May, the three banks and the Reserve Association carefully discussed and intended to stop the supply of cash withdrawals for transfers, but they did not do so because of the easy stimulation of public sentiment.</p>
<p>Since the banking and money shop industry received the order from the Ministry of Finance restricting deposits and withdrawals, the Reserve Association simultaneously implemented the suspension of the supply of cash withdrawals for transfers to various colleagues. On June 23, the black market for transfer discounts soared to more than 130 yuan, and then fell slightly to less than 100 yuan. After July 14, it rose step by step, reaching a high of more than 240 yuan in August. After September, it gradually fell back, and after October 27, it hovered within 36 yuan to 50 yuan. The trend at the end of the year was particularly stable and welcomed by industry and commerce. Some foreign banks that had refused to accept transfers after August 13 had already started accepting them because of this. After the Reserve Association stopped the supply of the transfer discount market, although speculators initially took the opportunity to profit due to the market chaos and forcibly held it up, since August and September, public and commercial confidence has gradually recovered, and people in various industries have a deep understanding of the lock-up of bonuses in extraordinary times and the stability and protection of the new interbank transfers. Speculators gradually lost their support.</p>
<p>6. Conclusion</p>
<p>The Shanghai financial situation over the past year is roughly as described above. The segmentation is often inappropriate, and the description is inevitably incomplete. Although I have tried my best to avoid subjective comments, and have written as much as possible, I have repeatedly entered subjective assertions, which may be inevitable. I deeply regret this. In short, this article, regarding the various financial projects, even the aforementioned economic diseases, any one of which is sufficient for specialized research. Please regard this article as a proposal for financial research.</p>
<h3>Market Knowledge Consultant</h3>
<p>Due to circumstances, this column has been suspended for three issues. There are many questions accumulated, and I will answer them in order as follows.</p>
<p>Mr. Cai Jidong's inquiry about the principle of transfer discounting can be read in the article by Mr. Zhou Mengyun in this issue. I will not repeat it.</p>
<p>Mr. Yao Shimin's inquiry about the "Chinese Cooperative Regulations and Ordinances" question, the question was not listed in the letter, so it is impossible to answer; please list it and then ask an expert to reply.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Xiuchuan's inquiry about cotton and wheat trading units is briefly answered as follows:</p>
<p>American Cotton The trading unit is one hundred bales, each bale weighing five hundred pounds. The market quotation unit is US cents per pound of American cotton.</p>
<p>Indian Cotton The quotation unit is one Candy, weighing 784 pounds; the value is Indian rupees.</p>
<p>English Cotton The quotation unit is pence per pound of English currency (see issues 291-3 of this publication for the above algorithms)</p>
<p>American Wheat Canadian Wheat The quotation unit is bushel, valued in US dollars and Canadian dollars. Each bushel is approximately equal to 0.34032151 Huashi.</p>
<p>Pound Sounds Not a monetary name, the English is Pojnl, which is a decimal after the decimal point. The American cotton quotation unit is US cents; cents are the smallest monetary name in the United States. A pound sound is a fraction of less than one US cent, and in terms of carry, it is equal to our country's milli. For example, a drop of five pound sounds is equal to a drop of five US mills; a rise of ten pound sounds is equal to a rise of one US mill. As for the point in the price of English cotton, the meaning is the same as that of pound sound. The English is Decimal, which means fraction. The quotation unit for English cotton is pence; for example, if it is said to have risen by nineteen points, it has actually risen by 0.19 pence; in terms of fractions, it is approximately equal to three-sixteenths of a penny. The US currency system is decimal, while the British currency system is not decimal. Therefore, one is called a pound sound and one is called a point to indicate the difference in calculation.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Jie wrote to say, "After reading Mr. Bao Leti's 'Fair Price of Imported Rice is Less Than 20 Yuan' in the previous issue of this newspaper, I inquired with those who returned from Vietnam last month, and they said the same. Recently, the foreign exchange rate has eased, so why is the selling price of imported rice in this city still around 37 yuan? However, compared with the cost price of 43.83 yuan per bag (equivalent to 25.06 yuan per stone) announced in the first group purchase of rice, the selling price seems to be still average. Is it true that the profit earned by the food transporters is only this small amount? Or is Bao Jun's calculation wrong? Please explain." The following can be answered:</p>
<p>Imported Rice Price, the price calculated by Bao Jun is the price per hundred catties; a stone is 160 catties; and a bag is 198 catties. Therefore, according to the market price cited by Bao Jun, each stone is about a little over 30 yuan, and each bag is a little less than 40 yuan. The difference from the current market price is indeed still far.</p>
<p>Bao Jun What he cited was the price of Rangoon rice in mid-July of last year, which was converted at the Shanghai exchange rate at the beginning of December; and the fee was added to five yuan, and the selling price of a little less than 20 yuan per load was obtained. Quadrupling its added fee, to be fair, it is not seen to be harsh but only seen to be lenient.</p>
<p>Imported Foreign goods, their cost price can be obtained by converting the foreign exchange rate in the place of origin, and the layer of added fees cannot be known by non-insiders. All unfair prices, protected by the added fees, can be spoken of as fair without shame, and this is not only true for foreign goods. The transportation of local products from the mainland to Shanghai is now also covered by the word added fees to cover up their greed.</p>
<h3>Calculation Principles of Remittance, Draft, and Discount, and Instructions on Abacus Positioning</h3>
<p>— Zhou Mengyun</p>
<p>The discount on remittance drafts is a matter of adding water, not a discount calculation. Therefore, when converting to legal tender, division should be used instead of multiplication. It is important to understand the meaning of division. One is that the first number contains the second number several times, and the other is that the first number is equally divided according to the second number. The discount rate for remittance drafts is based on a unit of one thousand yuan. "...Assuming there is now a remittance deposit of one hundred yuan, calculated according to the proportional formula, you can get current legal tender, ninety-three yuan, four jiao, and five fen plus change. It is not one hundred yuan for remittance, minus seven yuan discount equals ninety-three yuan." That is, add seventy yuan of water to one thousand yuan. Add seven yuan to one hundred yuan. Add seven fen per yuan. This adding water is the discount rate. According to the calculation principle, the face value of the remittance draft is the first number. - The real number is the dividend. (1) plus the discount rate, (one yuan and seven fen) is the second number. - The legal number is the divisor. The result of the division, the quotient obtained, is the multiple of (1) plus the discount rate contained in the face value of the remittance draft. Therefore, the following formula should be applied:</p>
<p>Remittance Draft ÷ (1 + Discount Rate) = Actual Legal Tender Received</p>
<p>Draft Face Value - Actual Legal Tender Received = Discount Fee</p>
<p>If we substitute the actual numbers from the example, then: $100.00 ÷ 1.07 = 93.45  $100.00 - 93.45 = 6.55</p>
<p>If one hundred yuan remittance minus seven yuan discount equals ninety-three yuan, then the formula to apply is:</p>
<p>Remittance Draft Face Value × Discount Rate = Discount Fee</p>
<p>Remittance Draft Face Value - Discount Fee = Actual Legal Tender Received</p>
<p>Substituting actual numbers into the simplified formula gives:</p>
<p>100 × 70/1000 = 7  100 - 7 = 93</p>
<p>The difference between the two formulas is four jiao and five fen plus change. The former formula uses division and is called the "external discount algorithm." The latter formula uses both subtraction and multiplication and is called the "internal discount" algorithm. The external discount is also known as the "true discount." This means calculating the discount fee based on the amount to be received on the date of the request for cash. This method is rarely used except for "remittance discounts." Internal discount is bank discount. (Bank Discount) This means calculating the discount based on the face value of the note and subtracting it from the face value of the note to get the actual amount received by the one who cashes it. Refer to the method of calculating the bank discount interest and the remaining amount after the discount of a promissory note, which is (1) calculate the value of the promissory note; (2) calculate the bank discount interest on the value of the promissory note during the discount period; (3) calculate the remaining amount of the value of the promissory note after deducting the bank discount and collection fees. There is a slight difference between remittance discounts and bank discounts on notes. Therefore, the "external discount" algorithm should be applied.</p>
<p>The special features of the abacus are speed and accuracy. That is, seeing the "bead" calls out the "formula", follows the "formula" to place the "bead", and the answer can be solved immediately. (With skilled technique, there is no need to call out the formula and you can handle it with ease.) However, the positions and formulas of the abacus must be memorized. Suppose in this example the remittance is one hundred yuan and the discount rate is seventy yuan per thousand yuan. Then place the dividend (1) on the left side of the abacus, set the third digit gap as the original unit. And use one zero seven (one plus discount rate is one yuan and seven yuan) as the divisor, place it on the right side of the abacus, or memorize it silently. The integer part of one yuan and seven fen is a one-digit legal number. That is, remember the "Division Positioning Formula" which says "One digit of the legal number, the unit of the quotient, is one digit to the left of the original unit." That is, in the next digit of the original real number (1). (For the abacus positioning method, see my book, "Description of the Abacus with Telescopic Decimal Point Symbol"). Therefore, the result of the calculation is known to be ninety-three yuan, four jiao, and five fen, with a remainder of eight li and five hao, which also means that the legal tender of the remittance note is worth about 0.9345 yuan. (In this example, the principle of the division "seeing one without division makes nine" is applied, which is omitted).</p>

<h3>Grain Hoarders Release Stock, Rice Prices Ease Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market was affected by the fact that only about 300 bags of early and late rice from Nangang were transferred from the inland source in Hongkou on Sunday. However, 76 bags of Jiaxing Lujian were also transferred from the Nanshi. Because the banks and warehouses were closed, no samples were shown. Therefore, there were not many goods for sale on the market. At the same time, after a period of stability in sales, yesterday, both local stores and wholesalers took a wait-and-see attitude and did not dare to purchase more rashly. Therefore, retail sales were sluggish all morning, and the market was calm. However, by midday, those who generally felt strong saw that the environment was not good and feared drastic changes, so those with a lot of goods in hand took the opportunity to sell. For a time, the market was flooded with returned goods, making it difficult to maintain prices. All varieties of rice, including Japonica, Indica, and foreign rice, depreciated by three to four jiao. Except for thick Japonica rice and extra-thin rice, which were still priced above forty yuan, early and late rice were only sold for thirty-nine yuan, two jiao, three fen to thirty-nine yuan. The supply and demand of white yuan were equal, with no significant difference. As for withered Indica rice, which had no market for a long time, it was transferred from Nanshi and opened at forty yuan and five jiao. No. 1 Saigon opened at forty-one yuan, No. 2 Saigon opened at thirty-nine yuan, five jiao, seven fen, and Tokyo Rice Bran thirty-seven yuan, seven jiao to thirty-six yuan, nine jiao, five fen, Rice broken 31.35. After this drop, many took advantage of the low prices to purchase, and sales gradually became active again. Just as the market was about to close, inland merchants also came out to buy briskly, and the market showed a slight tightening, resulting in a slight easing of the price for prepared goods by one or two jiao.</p>

<h3>The City Commemorated January 28th Yesterday with Extremely Solemn Emotions - Leaflets with Exhortations Found Everywhere - Strict Precautions in the Concessions - Nothing Happened All Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the eighth anniversary of the January 28th Shanghai War. People from all walks of life in the city solemnly commemorated the event and promoted frugality, national construction savings, and the spring tribute to the military campaign to show their determination to support national policies. The concession authorities implemented emergency precautions. The order was peaceful throughout the day. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Solemn Commemoration</p>
<p>Yesterday, all sectors of the city commemorated the eighth anniversary of the January 28th Shanghai War. They recalled the Japanese invasion of Shanghai eight years ago and the heroic soldiers of the 19th Route Army, who rose up for the first time to bravely resist in defense of the homeland, lasting for 34 days, creating a tragic and glorious record, opening the prelude to the nation's resistance against foreign insults, and laying the foundation for the overall war of resistance. Its significance is extremely important. Today, as the overall war of resistance continues to evolve and final victory is not far off, we remember the soldiers and civilians who died at that time, and all the soldiers of the War of Resistance, vowing to firmly support national policies and obey the leader's determination. Therefore, in addition to automatically stopping entertainment banquets for one day to express our thoughts, all sectors have decided to intensify the promotion of frugality, savings, and the spring tribute to the military movement in action to practice the meaning of commemoration, in order to strengthen our strength and strive for victory.</p>
<p>Leaflets Discovered</p>
<p>Yesterday, all entertainment venues in the city, such as the Golden Grand Theater, Gong Stage, Grand Stage, Great World, Tianchan Stage, Renewal Stage, Lafayette Theater, and Xuan Palace Theater, voluntarily closed for one day. Others, such as cinemas and dance halls, were open as usual, but business was sluggish. At about 5 o'clock yesterday morning, many colorful commemorative leaflets were found in front of the Daxin Company on Nanjing Road, Wuma Road, and Great World. Passers-by scrambled to read them, and emotions were extremely excited. In addition, the Shanghai Branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League also issued a letter to the youth yesterday, urging the youth of all circles to maintain the patriotic enthusiasm of the Anti-Japanese War eight years ago, continue to carry it forward, and strive for independent survival.</p>
<p>Precautions on Bridges</p>
<p>The Public Concession's Police Department took measures to prevent unscrupulous elements from taking the opportunity to disrupt public order. Therefore, starting at six o'clock yesterday morning, the Moolaque Bridge, Basin Lane Bridge, and New Garbage Bridge on the Suzhou River were closed to traffic. The Tianhou Temple Bridge was open to pedestrians and vehicles. The Old Zhabei Bridge was only open to pedestrians, and the Old Garbage Bridge was only open to vehicles. Many guards were stationed at each bridge to conduct searches. British, American, French, and Italian defense forces and the International Volunteer Corps were ordered to assist in maintaining order. Armored patrol teams patrolled and searched pedestrians and vehicles along the way to ensure safety.</p>
<p>Road Blockade</p>
<p>In addition to sealing off the areas bordering the Chinese areas in both concessions to strengthen precautions, the authorities simultaneously blocked non-essential roads such as Jiangxi Road, Tianzhutang Street, Zhu Bao San Road, Jixiang Street, Zilai Bridge, Dagou Bridge, Mcdilian Road, Fang Street, East-West Zilaihuo Street, Yunnan Road, Guangxi Road, Bali Bridge Street, Longmen Road, Bell Road, Chongqing Road, Danshui Road, Luzon Road, Baille Road, Merming Road, Maxie Road, and non-essential roads and alleys, leaving only the Bund, Henan Road, Fujian Road, Shu Xin Bridge, Great World, Chengdu Road, Tongfu Road, Seymour Road and other exits open for pedestrians and vehicles. However, a large number of Chinese and Western detectives were stationed at each exit to strictly implement inspections and preventions thoroughly.</p>
<p>Situation in Nanshi</p>
<p>There were no traffic obstructions in Nanshi for the January 28th commemoration. All French concession iron gates were not closed. In the Nanshi area, the Japanese army used the Rihui Port as a natural divide and stationed a large number of troops west of the port. Only the Pingyin Bridge and Rihui Bridge on the east side of the port were open to traffic. Therefore, "Constables" and "police" were specially assigned to conduct strict searches. Japanese military police and guard units increased their patrols to supervise the "police" and strictly inspected the people entering at Xie Bridge, Nanyang Bridge, Xin Qiao Street, and Xin Kai River. Therefore, although there was no formal martial law in Nanshi, there was an intangible martial law in action.</p>
<p>Peaceful Throughout the Day</p>
<p>Yesterday, the "January 28th" Commemoration Day, the order was exceptionally peaceful throughout the day, because the authorities of both concessions implemented joint precautions and prevention was extremely strict. There were no incidents until late at night. According to police department news, the emergency precautions will be lifted starting at zero o'clock this morning, and all road traffic will be restored to its original state. However, before the 30th of this month, all kinds of gatherings, except those specially approved by the Public Works Department, will not be allowed.</p>
<h3>US Ship Chaumont Completes Service, to be Replaced by Two Other New Ships</h3>
<p>The US transport ship "Chaumont" has been in service in the Far East for nearly fifteen years. The ship will make its last voyage across the Pacific Ocean back to the United States in the shortest possible time, and the Navy Department will send other fleets to replace it. It is reported that the "Chaumont" last arrived in Shanghai in August last year. It carried refugees from the Tianjin flood from Qinhuangdao, North China, to Shanghai. After that, the ship's whereabouts passed through the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on the east coast of the United States a month ago. The Chaumont first arrived in Shanghai on February 24, 1927, carrying the fourth US Marines stationed in Shanghai. It arrived in Shanghai again on September 13, 1937, carrying General Piboult, commander of the naval forces from San Diego to Shanghai, a voyage that took only 21 days from California. The US transport ship Henderson left Shanghai yesterday morning to return to the United States. The Chaumont will also be transferred, and two other new transport ships will replace it. Along with the Henderson, a total of three ships will take turns sailing between the US Pacific coast and the Far East every month. The names of the two new ships are unknown, but it is known that they can arrive in Shanghai by mid-August next year. As for the Henderson, it will come to Shanghai in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3>British Ship Detained by Japanese - British Navy Negotiating - Britain Hopes Japan Will Not Insist on Prestige to Avoid Escalating the Incident</h3>
<p>London, 28th - Associated Press - It was learned here last night that the recent boarding of the British merchant ship "Yong Sheng" by the Japanese Navy near Fuzhou has been negotiated with the Japanese side by the British naval authorities in Shanghai. The "Yong Sheng" was detained by the Japanese warship for eleven hours, and the Japanese warship fired two shots at the bow of the ship. The owner of the "Yong Sheng" issued a statement stating that the ship was searched by the Japanese under protest.</p>
<p>British Army in Shanghai Makes Concessions</p>
<p>Shanghai, 27th - Havas - The British Jardine Matheson ship "Yong Sheng" was intercepted and questioned by a Japanese warship in the waters of Fujian Province, China, yesterday, and detained for up to fifteen hours. According to sources in diplomatic circles here, the British naval authorities in Shanghai have made concessions to the Japanese side, but as of now, the British government has not officially negotiated with the Japanese government.</p>
<p>Kuangning Ship Also Intercepted</p>
<p>It has been learned that the British ship "Wen Ning" was intercepted by a Japanese warship near Hong Kong or even in British territorial waters some days ago. According to well-informed sources, the British government has negotiated with the Japanese ambassador to the UK, Mamoru Shigemitsu. The British government originally did not attach great importance to this kind of incident, but if the Japanese government cannot resolve the "Asama Maru" case within a reasonable period of time, the British government may change its attitude.</p>
<p>Britain's Attitude is to Appease People</p>
<p>In short, Britain is willing to do everything possible to avoid any incidents that may cause tension between Britain and Japan. However, the Japanese side must also show sincerity and must not escalate the situation due to insisting on prestige or other reasons.</p>
<h3>Belgian Ambassador Guillaume Arrives in Shanghai From Peiping</h3>
<p>Continental Press reports that the Belgian ambassador to China, Baron Guillaume, arrived in Shanghai from Peiping yesterday morning (27th) with his family by the Shuntian ship and is temporarily residing in the Belgian Consulate at No. 1300 Lafayette Road.</p>
<h3>Ning Shao Sends Telegram to Shanghai - Reports Local Peace - Ningbo Hua Feng Yarn Factory Loses Caution - More Than 3,000 Passengers From De Ping Arrive</h3>
<p>The Japanese troops crossing the Qiantang River, the troops spying from the west, were blocked at Wenjia Yan. The fighting in that area was extremely fierce. According to sources from Zhejiang provincial groups in the city yesterday, the Japanese troops had retreated to Kuaiji Mountain, where they were in danger of being wiped out. The troops invading from the east, after abandoning Qianqing Town, had retreated to the Xixing River bank near the Shao Xiao bus station, and their situation was desperate. They seemed to be preparing to retreat to the north bank. Therefore, the situation on the south bank will be stabilized within a day or two. The situation in Shaoxing has become stable because the Japanese army abandoned Qianqing Town. It is found that Shaoxing is about seventy li away from Qianqing Town. When the battle in Qianqing Town was fierce, artillery fire could be heard in the city of Shaoxing, so people were more panicked. Now it has become stable. According to a wine boat partner who left Shaoxing on the 24th of this month to Shanghai, when they left Shaoxing, the shops in the urban area were closed and people were migrating in an endless stream, but there was no arson.</p>
<p>Linpu Hit by Shells</p>
<p>According to the Shaoxing Association in Shanghai, telegrams reporting peace have been received from Keqiao, Shaoxing, Shangyu, Yuyao, and Ningbo. However, the situation in Xiaoshan is chaotic. The association has telegraphed the Shangyu County Chamber of Commerce to find out the details, but has not yet received a reply. According to the association's news, the Japanese army did not capture Linpu Town in Xiaoshan. However, Japanese artillery from Hangzhou shelled the town, causing two shells to hit the market, and part of the city's houses were burned down.</p>
<p>Yong Factory Loses Caution</p>
<p>According to passengers who came to Shanghai from Yong yesterday, the Huafeng Yarn Factory on the east bank of Ningbo Jiangdong suddenly lost caution on the 24th of this month at noon. The factory has a capital of more than 10 million yuan and is the largest yarn factory in Yongbu. On that day, the oil room lost caution and the fire spread to various machine rooms. For a time, the fire raged out of control. The fire was extinguished after several fire brigades tried their best to put out the fire. According to the investigation, the loss was at least more than 4 million yuan. It is also known that Japanese planes flew to Lishe Airport to drop bombs at the time, causing all parties to mistakenly believe that Japanese planes were bombing the Ningbo urban area. The rumor of a major fire in Ningbo in the city is probably a misrepresentation of this matter.</p>
<p>De Ping Passengers</p>
<p>The Italian Sino-Italian Company's Deping ship arrived in Shanghai from Yong the day before yesterday and entered the port that night. This was the first shipping ship to carry passengers to Shanghai after the outbreak of the war in eastern Zhejiang. It carried more than 3,100 passengers and more than 7,000 pieces of local goods such as tin foil and Shaoxing wine. According to a crew member who spoke to a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency, Ningbo had been ordered to evacuate the population on the 24th after the outbreak of the war in Xiaoshan. Currently, the residents in the city are all moving to the countryside, and the city's face has not changed as before, but it is not as lively as before.</p>

<h3>Wu Kaixian Issues Proclamation - Persuading Those with Shaky Faith to Wake Up - Wu Shaoshu Sends Letter From Hong Kong Encouraging All Sectors</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, 28th - Wu Kaixian, Deputy Minister of the Organization Department of the Central Party Headquarters, issued a proclamation yesterday, stating roughly: Since Wang Changyan advocated peace, the impact has been such that the environment has become worse and life has become more expensive. All people in Shanghai have suffered from it. You may be lured by profit or threatened, although you cannot be compared with those who "recognize thieves as fathers" and "work for tigers," but it is also because of shaky faith and incautious friends that you have come to this. In the past, you may have hated fallacies, or been drunk with profit and personal gain, and you have been obsessed and incorrigible. Now that Gao Tao has gone far away and the secret agreement has been revealed, even if you have not conspired with them, you are also in agreement. I hope you will wake up in time, turn back, and atone for your sins. Our Central Committee will not blame the past. When will the pressure and reward be? You choose for yourself.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 28th - Wu Shaoshu, chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, issued a letter to leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai after arriving in Hong Kong from Shanghai, saying: I have sent a letter before, and I hope you will be aware of it. I am determined to do my best for society and be loyal to the party and the country, as Shaoshu has requested and is fortunately as expected, how can I not be inspired? Now, reports of victory in the war of resistance are frequent, and the establishment of the country has just begun its constitutional government. Wang's cadres, such as Ying Tao, have now painfully fled to Hong Kong, declaring their secret agreements and announcing them to the people, which further proves that their Zhangyan proposal is an illusion, making our country a vassal state, making our people meat, and destroying our China forever. The leaders of the Executive Council have the responsibility to guide. I hope that you will use the first knowledge to know the later knowledge, and the first awareness to awaken the later awareness. The future of resistance and construction is really dependent on it. Shaoshu is incompetent and willing to work with the Executive Council to plan for it.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Settlement of Postal Packages - No Restrictions in Concession Areas</h3>

<h3>Wuxi Puppet Official - Premonition of Being Killed - Sheep Head Suddenly Falls to the Ground During Confucius Ceremony - Yang Yang Tong Jin Thinks it is Unlucky</h3>
<p>According to a visitor from Wuxi, after the case of Yang Gao Bai, the puppet county magistrate of the county, being shot and assassinated on the way on the 9th of this month, the entire city was in a state of tension at that time. The city gate was closed for five days, and door-to-door searches were conducted, with some families being searched as many as six or seven times. Traffic between Shanghai and Wuxi was virtually cut off for ten days. Finally, the visitor reiterated that Yang had obtained an ominous sign before the accident, which was quite intriguing. That is, Yang, in his capacity as puppet county magistrate, served as the chief priest on the day of the autumn sacrifice to Confucius several months ago. On that day, Yang was dressed in splendid clothes and personally went to the ceremony. However, just as the ceremony was about to end, the ceremony officer stood aside and respectfully read the memorial text, just as he recited the words "Chief Priest Yang," the head of the sacrificial sheep in the three animals displayed in the center of the temple suddenly fell to the ground from the wooden frame. At that time, Yang was shocked and thought it was ominous, because Yang thought that "Yang" and "sheep" had the same sound. Now that the sheep has fallen for no reason, he is afraid that he will have the danger of falling himself. He did not expect it to be a premonition of a fatal disaster. Everyone in Xidi knows about this, and it is regarded as a topic of conversation.</p>

<h3>Four Banks' Damaged Notes: Exchange and Redemption Without Regional Restrictions, Stipulating Mutual Exchange and Redemption with Timely Reporting; Areas Without Banks Have Designated Agencies</h3>
<p>The Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and Farmers Bank of China, upon the order of the Ministry of Finance, promulgated the revised measures for exchanging and redeeming damaged banknotes, and have specially formulated eleven implementing measures. The original text is recorded as follows: (1) The four banks shall exchange and redeem damaged notes without regional restrictions, mutually exchanging and redeeming for each other, and sending them to the issuing bank for exchange at any time. If only one of the four banks exists in a certain area, that bank shall exchange and redeem on behalf of the others, and send them to its Chongqing branch for exchange with the other three banks.</p>
<p>Agencies for Exchange and Redemption</p>
<p>(2) In areas where the four banks are not established, the four banks shall jointly entrust the following agencies to exchange and redeem: The exchange and redemption agencies are divided into two types: 1. Primary exchange and redemption agencies; 2. Auxiliary exchange and redemption agencies. (1) Primary exchange and redemption agencies: A. Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau; B. Local banks in various provinces and commercial financial institutions in various regions; C. Cooperative credit societies in various regions. (2) Auxiliary exchange and redemption agencies: D. Tax collection agencies in various regions; E. Agencies designated by county governments. For primary exchange and redemption agencies, except for the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, which has already signed an agreement for agency, B. Local banks in various provinces and commercial financial institutions in various regions; C. Cooperative credit societies in various regions, shall be selected and entrusted by the four banks through agreements. For auxiliary exchange and redemption agencies, the Ministry of Finance shall separately forward the instructions to the provincial governments for compliance. (3) If the agencies that have entered into agreements with the four banks need to pre-allocate funds for the exchange and redemption of damaged notes, they may apply for allocation and deposit, and report to the Joint Treasury for record. (4) The agencies shall hang a wooden sign in front of their premises with the words "Agency for the Four Banks of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and Farmers Bank of China for Exchanging and Redeeming Damaged Banknotes," and the county governments shall issue public notices to inform the public. The four banks shall also hang the same wooden sign in front of their premises.</p>
<p>Exchange and Redemption Measures</p>
<p>(5) The exchange and redemption of damaged notes shall be handled in accordance with the exchange and redemption measures stipulated by the "Issuing Reserve Management Committee." The agencies shall post the relevant measures and shall not unreasonably discount or intentionally create difficulties. (6) When an agency exchanges and redeems damaged banknotes, if it encounters difficult situations, it shall have the holder sign or affix a seal on the banknote, and the agency shall issue a temporary receipt, and send the banknote directly to the nearest of the four banks issuing the banknote for identification. The nearest of the four banks shall then reply before the exchange can be made. The nearest of the four banks shall still return the banknote in case the holder is unwilling to wait. (7) The four banks' damaged banknotes redeemed by the agency shall be stamped on both sides with the seal "This damaged banknote has been exchanged and redeemed by a certain agency and is void." This seal shall be clearly visible and difficult to erase.</p>
<p>Reporting Procedures</p>
<p>(8) The agency shall seal and sign the returned damaged notes every time, and send them to the four banks in Chongqing by registered mail for verification. However, when 100 yuan is reached, it shall be sent out at any time, and within one or two days after sending, a report form shall be filled out, together with the postal registration slip, and sent to the four banks in Chongqing. After the four banks verify that there are no errors, the amount shall be immediately remitted back, or deducted from the allocated funds. (9) The handling fee for the agency shall be calculated at 20 per mille, with 10 per mille given to the agency and 10 per mille given to the personnel of the agency. This handling fee shall be paid by the four banks according to their respective amounts received. (10) If the four banks' damaged banknotes exchanged by the agency are altered or forged, the agency shall be responsible for compensation. (11) The four banks shall universally distribute sample banknotes to the agencies.</p>
<h3>Jardine Matheson Cotton Cloth Temporarily Postponed Import</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government, because it cannot verify whether the cotton cloth produced by Jardine Matheson, such as the "Nine Heavens" brand, is enemy goods, has telegraphed the Ministry of Economic Affairs for verification. Before a reply is received, all imports should be temporarily postponed to prevent enemy goods from being mixed in. Special orders have been issued to all counties to comply.</p>
<h3>Wang Yu-cheng Dies in Hong Kong Residence</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Yu-cheng was a member of the Tongmenghui from Siam. In the past, he dedicated himself to the revolutionary cause and was highly regarded by Sun Yat-sen. During the Restoration, he served as the Chief of the Guards of the Provisional Presidential Palace in Nanjing. In his later years, he retired in Shanghai and spared no effort in supporting social charity. After August 13th, due to the special situation in Shanghai, he resided in Hong Kong, continuing his social work and gaining a good reputation, which was valued by the local authorities. Unfortunately, news has come that he suddenly passed away in his Hong Kong residence on the 26th of this month at亥時 (9-11PM), at the age of 71. He is survived by three sons, four daughters, and three grandsons. His eldest son, Yingbin, is currently the Secretary-General of the Southwest Transportation Company and the Director of the Chongqing Company. His second son, Yingshuo, works in Chongqing, and his youngest son, Yingming, is still studying. Upon hearing the news of his death, friends and relatives in this city were deeply saddened. His remains are currently placed at 227 Nathan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong. After the situation stabilizes, they will be transferred to Shanghai for burial.</p>
<h3>A Review of Shanghai's Industry in 1939 (3) - Part 3 of the Shanghai Municipal Council Annual Report</h3>
<p>There is a factory specializing in the manufacture of electrical switches, formerly located in Yangshupu, with a large scale, now relocated to the area outside the boundary road, but its scope has been reduced. A fan factory, formerly located in Yangshupu, will resume operations within the concession, and a large-scale new factory building is under construction. The manufacturing of radio parts has developed rapidly, and the development of entertainment venues has led to an increasing number of neon lights being installed.</p>
<p>In the tobacco, wine, and food industries, tobacco factories suffered heavy damage during the war. Last year, two new factories built factory buildings in the western district, one of which has already started operations, and another large-scale one is under preparation. Some companies' products are packaged and sold by smaller tobacco factories. One new soda factory and one new brewery have started operations. A biscuit company, formerly located in the eastern district, has built a factory in the western district and started operations. The sales of locally made biscuits and sweets are generally booming. The output of cheap flour decreased at the end of the year, due to the reduced sales in the inland areas and the difficulty of transporting it to North China. Oil mills experienced slower business due to the difficulty of transporting sesame and cottonseed from the inland areas to Shanghai. Tea experienced a sudden boom in exports from Xiamen, but after the outbreak of the European war, the North African market was cut off, and a factory announced a temporary shutdown at the end of the year due to seasonal factors.</p>
<p>Working Conditions</p>
<p>The internal conditions of some factories have improved, due to several reasons: the most important of which is the creativity and interest of the factory owners themselves, especially the founders of new factories. Many of these factory owners are young, technically trained, inherit the spirit of reform from their predecessors, and are enterprising. As for the mechanical engineers and chemical engineers employed by the factories, it is not uncommon for them to have received university education. Even in smaller machine factories, accurate drawings are now prepared, whereas previously only sketches were available. Furthermore, the training of workers and supervisors is considered indispensable. When factory owners select apprentices, they often restrict their minimum level of education. In addition, the Industrial Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council carefully supervises all equipment in new industries, which is also a way to promote improvement. Whenever a factory is renovated, the section makes every effort to use this opportunity to improve all equipment within the possible range, and the factories readily cooperate with these measures.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Industrial Section seven years ago, it has carefully planned to improve factories. According to Article 33 of the Police Regulations, "Whoever commits any of the following acts shall be subject to detention for up to fifteen days or a fine of up to fifteen yuan: (1) Operating an industrial or commercial enterprise in violation of laws and regulations." Article 18 of the same law stipulates, "An order to cease business operations shall be applicable to repeat offenders of the same violation of police regulations." The Industrial Section, based on the above two regulations, seeks to ensure that factories comply with regulations. When a factory was overcrowded, the section prohibited it from carrying out fire-prone work in the factory. Although there were no explicit restrictions by the Bureau on such situations, the court ultimately accepted the case. In two other cases, one case involved the rules for installing pneumatic machinery promulgated by the Bureau, which were also recognized by the court as valid. In addition, there are many important innovations, such as the eight-hour work system, which has been adopted by three cotton mills, one carpet factory, and one taro factory. Other improvements include reducing the heat and noise in factories, improving dormitory facilities, and installing cooking steam boilers, all of which have been effective. However, after the war, most factories were too crowded, which threatened the health and safety of workers, and there was little room for improvement in these factories.</p>
<p>Accidents</p>
<p>The number of reported industrial and occupational accidents for the whole year was 1,942, compared to 1,513 in the previous year. This number does not fully represent the exact number of all accidents, as the routine reports received by the Industrial Section from the factories are still very slow. Most of the above reports come from the police station, ambulances, and hospitals. The events reported by hospitals account for about 40 percent, and this number may not include all accidents treated by hospitals. As for cases of workers' serious injury or death, there were 595 cases, accounting for about one-third of the total, which were thoroughly investigated, and the factories were ordered to take appropriate measures to prevent the recurrence of similar events. The total number of deaths due to accidents was 110, exceeding previous records. (88 in 1938, 58 in seven months of 1937, and 95 in 1936.) Workers' deaths account for about 5.6% of all reported cases, an increase of about 0.2% compared to the previous year. (End of section)</p>

<h3>Lack of Freedom in Marriage: Gorgeous Girl Commits Suicide by Poison; Lover Far Away in Xindu Sends Frequent Letters; Parents Choose Another Match, Angered and厭世</h3>
<p>Min Yiqun, a woman from Changsha, is twenty years old, with beautiful features. Wearing a long camel-colored wool coat and permed hair, she is certainly a modern woman. The night before, she checked into room number two of the Yipinxin Hotel on Yuqiaqing Road alone, intentionally seeking accommodation. Unexpectedly, around 9:00 AM the next morning, she swallowed four bottles of sedative pills and attempted suicide. After a while, she groaned loudly. The waiter discovered her and tried to open the door, and reported to the Zhabei Police Department, which dispatched officer number 116 in a car, summoning an ambulance to rush her to Renji Hospital for treatment. It was heard that she had taken too much poison, and her life was still in danger until midnight. It was later learned that Min was studying at a certain girls' school, and had a lover working at the Chongqing Aviation Administration as a pilot. Although separated by thousands of miles, they corresponded frequently, exchanging several letters each month, and their affection grew stronger. Unexpectedly, a bolt from the blue struck recently: her parents are arranging another marriage for her, and the wedding date is approaching. Min suddenly heard this news and was devastated. She had been depressed for days, and after much deliberation, felt厭世 and resorted to this measure.</p>
<h3>Liu Guankun Arrested for Swindling Rice</h3>
<p>Liu Guankun, a local youth, defrauded Feng Rice Store near the Nicheng Bridge of three dan of white rice by fraudulent means at 6:00 PM on the 19th of this month. Liu claimed to be the catering manager of the Xin Xin Company factory on Nanjing Road and asked the rice store to deliver the rice and collect the money. When the rice was delivered to the front of the Xin Xin Company, Liu told the old manager that he would send someone to guard the rice himself. Unexpectedly, Liu sneaked out from another door and carried it away. The old manager waited until 7:00 PM in the evening, and when Liu did not come out to pay, he knew something was wrong and reported to the accounting office. The day before yesterday afternoon, Liu walked past the front of the store again, and was spotted by an employee, who called the police and arrested him, escorting him to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special Court, where he was prosecuted for fraud. After the magistrate钟 questioned him, he ordered him to be remanded in custody and adjourned the trial.</p>
<h3>Man Runs Wildly, Police Open Fire and Capture Him</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 5:20 PM, near Guangdong Road on Henan Road in the Public Concession, a man was walking south along Henan Road. At that time, a patrol car was checking pedestrians in the area. Seeing that the man was behaving suspiciously, they immediately chased him and ordered him to stop for a search. Unexpectedly, upon seeing the patrol car approaching, the man immediately ran away. Despite repeated orders from the police to stop, he continued to run wildly. The police became more suspicious and immediately drew their guns and fired a shot at his legs, knocking him down and capturing him. He was taken to the police station for questioning.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Flour Mills Lack Raw Materials, Order American and Australian Wheat, First Batch of 30,000 Dan to Arrive in Shanghai Next Month, Flour Prices Expected to Fall</h3>
<p>Shanghai flour mills are now selling well, but lack raw materials. They have newly ordered large quantities of wheat from the United States and Australia. The first batch of more than 30,000 dan is expected to be loaded and shipped to Shanghai early next month, and flour prices are expected to fall. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Ordering Foreign Wheat</p>
<p>The seven flour mills in this city, including Fuxin, Fufeng, Maoxin, Huafeng, Zhengyi, and Youda, because the wheat from North China has been completely controlled by the Japanese, and the areas of northern Jiangsu and Zhejiang and Anhui have been disturbed by the Japanese army along the way, making it difficult to transport wheat to Shanghai. Even when small amounts are transported, they are subject to harsh taxes and extortion by the Japanese, increasing costs. As a result, there is a severe shortage of raw materials for flour production. In order to prevent a forced shutdown, they have separately ordered large quantities of foreign wheat from the United States and Australia to maintain future raw material supplies. However, the total amount ordered by each factory is currently unknown.</p>
<p>Arriving Next Month</p>
<p>The flour mills believe that the current selling price of flour is not far from the cost of using foreign wheat. Although the European war is still continuing, the United States and Australia are currently neutral, and shipping lines transport goods without hindrance. Therefore, they have ordered foreign wheat from the United States and Australia. According to flour industry sources, the first batch of more than 30,000 dan of foreign wheat newly ordered from the United States and Australia is being transported to China by shipping lines hired by merchants who have received orders from those countries. The arrival date in Shanghai is expected to be early next month. It is said that the price of flour in Shanghai is expected to fall once the foreign wheat arrives.</p>
<h3>Hengren Shipping Company: Resolving Disputes, Seals Awaiting Expert Authentication</h3>
<p>The Hengren Shipping Company on Hankou Road, which went bankrupt and ceased operations last spring due to poor cash flow, entrusted Wang Yigong, the assistant manager of the company, as the liquidator, stating that he would receive a monthly allowance of 300 yuan for transportation expenses. During the liquidation process, Wang successively advanced approximately 9,700 yuan, and in January of the same year, Xu borrowed another 18,000 yuan from Wang.</p>
<p>Promissory Note Established</p>
<p>Recently, Wang repeatedly sent letters urging Xu to repay the loan, but Xu ignored them. Wang then commissioned lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court, suing Xu for the recovery of the debt. Magistrate Yu Changzi repeatedly held court hearings, but the defendant Xu Guansheng denied borrowing the money, claiming that the seal on the promissory note was not his seal, and submitted his seal to the court. The court sent it to the Forensic Department of the Police Department for authentication. The authentication result by Henry Deromon, the chief of the inspection division, was</p>
<p>It is said that the strokes of the seal are slightly different in thickness. The case was heard again previously, and both parties, accompanied by their lawyers, appeared in court. The lawyer representing the plaintiff stated that he requested to replace the authenticator, presenting four reasons, and presented more than ten pieces of evidence obtained by the plaintiff, all of which were seals usually affixed by the defendant, requesting verification. The court immediately showed them to the defendant for inspection. The defendant admitted that the seals on the documents were indeed affixed by him, but claimed that the seal on the promissory note was not his seal.</p>
<p>At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that in order to facilitate the court's proceedings, the plaintiff had taken simultaneous photos of the seals on the documents and the promissory note, and there was no difference. Since the defendant admitted that the seals on the documents were correct, the facts were clear and there was no room for denial. After reviewing the situation, the court stated that the authentication of the seal was a major matter and ordered that after the court separately appointed a epigraphy expert for authentication, a summons would be issued for another hearing.</p>

<p>Min Anji, a 45-year-old resident of number 33, Xu Road, Xujiahui, is a small vendor. Suffering from an illness, he has an opium addiction and has opium paraphernalia at home for smoking. Recently, someone reported him to the French Police Station in Xujiahui, accusing him of privately setting up an opium den for people to smoke. The police station sent officers to investigate and found that Min Anji had an eight-month-old son named Shishibing. When the officers were searching, he was being breastfed by his mother. He became ill due to shock and died without medical treatment.</p>

<h3>The Uses of Snow</h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>Time passes, and it is once again the end of the year. The weather is cold and the ground is frozen, and the six-petaled flowers (snowflakes) are flying. Snow, being pure and white, symbolizes noble hermits. Countless historical anecdotes relate to snow, such as Yuan An lying in the snow, Cheng Men standing in the snow, and the Xie family composing poems about snow. These are the most famous, but they are not relevant to this publication, so I won't dwell on them. However, using snow to make beverages is very beneficial, especially if it is "Laba snow" (also called winter snow). Living on this isolated island, surrounded by intense fumes, with the winter being so dry and the internal heat so severe, it is easy to develop throat ailments! Fortunately, in the past few days, snowflakes have been dancing, extinguishing various epidemic germs. If one can store snow in jars, melt it into water, take it out from time to time, boil it, and drink it, it is both cooling and helps prevent seasonal diseases. It is also very beneficial to agricultural products, as grains and bean sprouts covered by Laba snow will have their locusts and other pests killed, ensuring a good harvest in the coming year, greatly benefiting the people.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Laba Snow section in the "Materia Medica" states: "Laba snow, when sealed in a dark place, will not spoil even after decades. Soaking grains in it will make them drought-resistant and insect-free. Sprinkling it on tables and mats will drive away flies. Covering all kinds of fruits will prevent moths and worms. It can also be used to 'detoxify, treat seasonal epidemics, infantile fever and manic crying, adult elixir-induced flare-ups, post-alcohol heatstroke, and jaundice. A small, warm dose can be taken internally, and it can be used to wash the eyes to reduce redness. It can be used to brew tea, cook porridge, relieve heat and quench thirst, and is suitable for decocting medicines for cold-induced fever and heatstroke. It is also good for treating prickly heat.'" Therefore, the benefits of Laba snow are immense, and it is indeed fitting to call it "auspicious snow!"</p>
<h3>Appreciating Plum Blossoms in a Garret Room</h3>
<p>— Ai Li</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Zhuodai put it well: Most Shanghai families only have a home and no garden. Indeed, many of my relatives and friends have homes without gardens. You can forget about admiring flowers and trees, or breathing fresh air. They spend their days crammed into a few rooms, feeling utterly suffocated. Such families without gardens do not fully meet the "dwelling" requirement of "clothing, food, shelter, and transportation," and are truly unworthy of being called families. I am a person who loves flowers and trees. When I was in my hometown, I had a garden with some flowers and trees. Unfortunately, now I am confined to this isolated island, living as a middle-class refugee in a garret room. Although I can barely call it a "home," it has no "garden." In past years, around this time of year, the plum trees in my hometown garden would bloom, and I would be intoxicated by their fragrance every day. But now, I only smell the foul air of the garret room. Where can I find the fragrance of plum blossoms? I have no choice but to seek a second-best option and buy one or two potted plum blossoms to display on my desk. But when I went to the market to look, all I found were stunted and twisted, sickly plum trees that were truly unappealing. Some of the potted plum blossoms looked like a mixed stir-fry in a restaurant, cluttered and unbearably vulgar, squeezing the noble plum blossoms within. It truly made me want to speak up for the plum blossoms. Because they were so crowded, I have been going for more than ten days, and still haven't bought a single pot. Yesterday, I visited a friend on Huanlong Road and passed by Avenue Albert, where I saw a garden at number 362 holding a "small plum blossom exhibition." When I went in to see it, I saw many plum blossom bonsai of various sizes displayed on a wooden table, arranged in a very orderly and artistic way, completely different from the messy arrangements I had seen elsewhere. This made me pay attention. I carefully examined each pot, some with a single tree, some with two or three trees planted together, and some with pine, bamboo, and plum blossoms combined to form the "Three Friends of Winter." They were pruned in a very fitting way and positioned very appropriately, truly captivating. After admiring them for a while, I saw a gardener nearby and asked who had made them. He replied that it was a Mr. Kong Zhiqing. As soon as I heard that name, I immediately remembered seeing his works at the Zhongxi Flower Exhibition in the autumn, which were indeed very good. No wonder these plum blossom bonsai were so refined and unique. I looked closely at the price tags on the pots and realized that they were for sale, so I bought two pots and took them home. My family was delighted to see them. So, this person who has a home but no garden is now able to appreciate plum blossoms in his garret room every day.</p>
<h3>A One-Week Budget Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Ye Ying</p>
<p>A few days ago, the editor of this publication forwarded a letter from a reader, Ms. [omitted name], who praised my budget menu, saying that it had been exceptionally helpful. I am truly humbled. The letter mentioned that the New Year is approaching, and many families tend to buy fish, meat, and other items in advance to avoid the price increases near the end of the year. However, after buying these items, they cannot be eaten immediately and must be preserved. Besides pickling, there are many other methods, but which is the best? In my opinion, pickling with fermented bean curd and wine paste is the best. For example, after pickling a pork leg for a few days, mash fermented soybean paste, coat it all over, and dry it in the sun. The wine paste method is more complicated. For items like wine-paste chicken and wine-paste meat, you must first cook them in a pot until tender, sprinkle them with salt while they are hot, and then dissolve the aged wine paste in warm water (using hot water will make it sour). Put it in a cloth bag and place the bag on top of the meat and chicken, letting the wine paste drip down. The container for the ingredients must be tightly sealed to prevent the wine paste from leaking. The method for pickling fish is simpler. Just pickle it briefly, then coat it with fermented bean curd and you're done.</p>

<h3>The Problem of Dyeing Clothes (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>Jian yellow and Jian leaf have long been highly valued, precisely because they are produced in that area. Thus, the porcelain from Jian kilns is whiter than that of Ganzhou, due to the presence of cobalt in the clay. Jian blue is a natural mud containing cobalt, not woad. Blue and white porcelain must use bowl blue, which is cobalt. The paper used for magnetic blue paper never fades because it also contains bowl blue. Sky blue overcoats and cyan mandarin jackets inevitably develop an oily sheen because the cobalt in them was originally a magnetic material that was not fully fired and therefore absorbed an excessive amount of [missing information]. Therefore, after the [missing information] diminishes and undergoes oxidation, becoming acidic, the sky blue color turns reddish, and the cyan color turns yellowish. The original color is sulfur, and sulfurization [missing information] is a natural mineral mud. Black clothing can hide dirt and grime, so it is favored by lazy, menial laborers. However, frequent washing with soapberry will inevitably cause the color to gradually fade into a [missing information] color. Therefore, when government officials select laborers, they can discern diligence from laziness by the color of their clothing, and soap-dyed clothing becomes the tool of servants. As for [missing information] white clothing, it is the result of diligent washing of the original color and prolonged exposure to the sun, demonstrating the virtuousness of a loving mother or a supportive wife in teaching her children well. Therefore, they are regarded as talented individuals. As for the clothing of soldiers, the old capital favored [missing information] colors so that they would be invisible from a distance in the mountains and rivers. If one wanted to be invisible at close range, green would be suitable to blend into the grass, trees, mountains, and lakes. In desert areas, yellow would be suitable, while in the [missing information] ocean, white would be suitable. Foreigners along the coast use white precisely for this reason. Their race is inherently white, which is their natural color. Today, we, the yellow race, abandon our natural color and also admire white, which can be called blind [missing information]. However, Westerners now value Eastern colors, and we also consider beige paper and camel wool to be Western colors and fashionable, which is truly laughable. [missing information] families who have ancient calligraphy and paintings with unsightly appearances seek to fake an ancient color to disguise their origins. Therefore, hair-edged paper is called "official square," because officials believe it to be square. The [missing information] surface uses [missing information] shell paper, which is its natural color and not dyed. Fake antique watches are [missing information] as old but with new colors, falsely claiming to be [missing information], deceiving those who do not know better. Therefore, I believe that people's hearts are turned outward, which used to be the case only for women who had to marry. Now, the hearts of both men and women are turned outward, so it is no wonder that they are so unrestrained. The best way to address this is to take the preferences of those in power [missing information] method can shift customs. White as a [missing information] color is originally for mourning and disliked by people. Yellow, as the correct color, has always been revered. Official documents still use yellow today. Why induce examiners to take notice as in the imperial examination papers? Generally speaking about the color of clothes, when I was a child, I preferred light colors, but later I preferred gray. When light colors are dyed again, they inevitably turn gray. Therefore, adding [missing information] to masculine colors makes them bluish-gray, and adding red to feminine colors makes them pinkish-gray. Bean-gray, mouse-gray, and so on, are all natural occurrences. Today, even new clothes are gray, which is a direct result of being fooled by merchants, turning old into new. The turning of waste paper into new paper by the paper industry is an example of this. In the past, we valued thrift, passing down clothes for generations, altering lengths from long to short, and sizes from large to small. Vests and leggings were wonderful uses of materials. Children's patchwork clothing and adults' peacock clothing were truly examples of making the most of everything, with no waste. Today, when making clothes, start with the natural color, then yellow, then yellow with red to make ochre, ochre with blue to make gray, and finally dye it black, which can also keep it new. However, before [missing information], one must remove the stains of the old dye. It is not necessary to use dry cleaning with gasoline, degreasing with Zuo Da, or bleaching with sulfuric acid. Simply use lye from wood ash to degrease. Once degreased, any plant pigment can be used with alum as a mordant. There is no need to eat [missing information] the White Pagoda, and then be unable to eat rice with meat. When those above like something, those below will [missing information] it. I hope that there will be a wind over the grass, shifting customs so that the hearts of those who are turned outward may turn inward. If this path is blocked, another path must be taken. Do not let them re-enter the wrong path to take shortcuts. The straightforward path can be peaceful without intervention. (The End)</p>

<h3>Why a Double Dose of New Year?</h3>
<p>— Chi Qiang</p>
<p>The New Year has just passed, but there is another old one coming. The one that passed was the Gregorian New Year, and now comes the "Lunar New Year's Eve"!</p>
<p>The wording is very pleasant, called the "Spring Festival," which is absolutely correct. In this way, there is no need for superfluous celebrations, and there is the reality of "old thoughts not exhausted."</p>
<p>When you have time, you might as well take a walk around the streets and pay attention to those busy faces, hurried footsteps, and tense, calculating minds. The second movement of the double concerto is once again resonating in your ears!</p>
<p>The Republic of China is only twenty-nine years old, in its prime; but the New Year has been celebrated fifty-eight times, stubbornly dragging it into the region of senility and decline. The Gregorian calendar is imitated in the same way, naturally in accordance with the "outward compliance" principle; but the Lunar New Year comes with a tail, and it is difficult to escape the criticism of "inner defiance!"</p>
<p>The Gregorian New Year is marked by hanging the national flag, taking holidays, young people sending New Year's cards, and public and private organizations or wealthy people "bowing in newspapers" to celebrate the New Year. The Lunar New Year is New Year's Eve, the end of monetary affairs, the elderly bowing and making gestures of congratulations, holding up their solid chins and saying, "You are another year older!"</p>
<p>In the middle, it seems as if twenty-nine large marks have been drawn, "Happy New Year," "Happy New Year"; "Old Year," "Old Year," "Old-fashioned New Year"; every year there is a double dose of tomfoolery.</p>
<p>If it is said that "firecrackers expel the old" at the end of the Gregorian New Year, and we have to wait until after the Lunar New Year to "replace the charms and renew the households," then the thirty or forty days in between, which are neither new nor old, will become the dregs under the double concerto of the end of the year! Are we not living some wrongful days? Are we not sacrificing this time at the beginning and end of the year in vain, with nowhere to return?</p>
<p>This kind of comical performance - a double concerto - is really commonplace in society. Celebrating the Lunar New Year is especially noticeable! If one person has this kind of thought, and the whole society has this kind of concept, then everything will be stuck in "obeying and defying are both possible," "ambiguity is permissible."</p>
<p>Therefore, after the New Year has already passed, those who are generally like idiots and madmen will once again play the double concerto of celebrating the New Year. Please, I sincerely advise you: Why a double dose of New Year!</p>

<h3>It's Also Test Driving</h3>
<p>— Long Ju Sheng</p>
<p>After reading Yu Xiangyun's article "Test Driving," I feel that the happiness of the wealthy is truly the life of "heaven's darlings"!</p>
<p>From Yu Xiangyun's test drive article, I suddenly thought of workers also living a "test driving" life as beasts of burden.</p>
<p>In the past two years, the war of resistance has created an isolated island where cotton mills under foreign influence have made a fortune. New cotton mills and new cloth factories have sprung up like bamboo shoots after rain.</p>
<p>The prelude to the opening of a cotton mill is—test driving—the spinning process, which is cotton cleaning, carding, coarse spinning, fine spinning, doubling, reeling... Male and female workers, driven by life, stand by the machines all day long, working hard to produce the products needed for the clothing of the masses. Male workers are on flat cars, cleaning cars, transporting (moving flowers)... Female workers are inspecting spindles, installing bobbins, and waiting quietly for the belt of the electric motor to turn, and then they are busy inspecting the roving frames or spinning frames, busy joining cotton yarn (sliver work), busy braking or stopping the machine, checking for any malfunctions. If you are a little lazy and are seen by the engineer or the machine operator, then a dismissal will immediately befall you, with no room for compromise!</p>
<p>Female workers must also have sharp eyes and dexterous hands and feet. As soon as they see a yarn break, they must quickly join it, otherwise the sliver of the yarn will become more and more chaotic, as messy as tangled silk, and you will be at a loss. They work twelve hours a day (the same as night workers), and besides the twenty-minute lunch break, they can be said to be companions with the machine, with no moment to rest.</p>
<p>As for test driving in the weaving room, although it is simpler than spinning, it is also hard enough for a female worker to manage three to five looms. The weaving process is bobbin weft, warp, warp sizing, and then weaving, watching the cloth (sorting out and checking the cloth for defects),... Male workers are sizing the warp, moving the yarn, moving the cloth,... Female workers are working the weft, moving the shuttles, busy preparing the warp and weft bobbins, putting them in the shuttles, waiting quietly for the electric motor to move, and then the looms are making a clattering noise. They manage three or five looms and must also pay attention to the density of the warp and weft in the finished cloth and the constant alternation of the shuttles, and they must work with all their energy with unblinking eyes to avoid owing debts. "Cloth in the hands of female workers, clothes on the bodies of the masses," after reading the "Test Driving" article in Business Contacts, please read "It's Also Test Driving," and the difference between happiness and distress is truly immeasurable.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty: World Traffic, Common Language, Children's Education, Scholarship, and Pity for Talent</p>
<p>Zhu Airen said, "What are we going to do taking over their new house? Aren't we going to make a scene at the wedding?" Speaking of making a scene at the wedding, China has always had this custom, and it exists everywhere. The more shy the bride is, the more intense the scene. This is not just making jokes, and some are simply practical jokes. The groom is still okay, but the bride can be said to be abused and suffer pain. Even to the point of causing trouble, this is really not a good custom. And making a scene at the wedding is also reciprocal. If you make a scene at someone else's wedding, they will make a scene at yours when you get married. This is all because brides in the past were not allowed to be seen, did not speak or smile, and were full of shyness, so people took the opportunity to tease them. This is because China has always had too strict restrictions on interactions between men and women. In the past, young women in China did not leave their boudoirs, and strangers could not even see them. When they went out, they had to cover themselves on all sides, like the women in Turkey in the past, who all wore a face veil, only showing their eyes. Later, when they were liberated, there was no indecent behavior. Because men and women rarely meet, they take advantage of the wedding to see her by making a scene at the wedding. But when they let them see, it's over. But some bridesmaids don't let them see, so the scene becomes even more intense. Now, marriage is a necessary stage in life, and there is nothing mysterious about it. Brides are all generous, talking and laughing, socializing as usual, and there is nothing to be ashamed of. This wedding scene will not happen again. At that time, after Wu Junsu proposed it, they were all happy to go to Jin Danyun's house. Only Junsu's sister, Junke, said, "I'm not going. I'm going back on the train tonight." Shao Huihua said, "It's still early in the morning, it's only half past nine now. Sister Danyun's house is very close to the West Railway Station. If you send a car to you for a while, it will take less than five minutes to get there. You can catch the 11:00 train just fine, otherwise, there is another train at 12:00. Or you might as well go early tomorrow morning. There are trains at 6:00 and 7:00 in the morning, and you can make it to school at 9:00, which is just in time." It turned out that at this time, the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway was completely double-tracked, so the number of trains running every day was more than doubled compared to before the war. Although the number has more than doubled, the people taking the train are still very crowded. Therefore, it is common to have two trains departing at the same time. Fortunately, the Jinghu Railway has recently developed its business and added a lot of locomotives and vehicles, which is enough to supply. And recently, the train heads, passenger cars, and freight cars have also been manufactured by China itself. (233)</p>
<h3>The Irrationality of Using Both Volume and Weight in the Rice Industry</h3>
<p>— Bao Kangjing</p>
<p>Different substances have different specific gravities. Even water, if the temperature is different, its specific gravity is not the same. It is clear that rice has differences such as native and foreign, indica and japonica, and their specific gravities are not necessarily the same. However, the rice industry sells rice, using volume for small quantities and weight for large quantities. With rice of different qualities and different specific gravities, fixing the scale at a point to match the volume (160 catties per market unit, including the bag, converted to one shi per market unit) is very irrational. Since domestic rice has been blocked and transportation is difficult, Saigon foreign rice is dumped. Foreign rice is dry and clean, and its weight differs from that of domestic rice by almost a tenth. Therefore, if one buys one shi of foreign rice, due to the use of weight, the actual volume is only a little over nine dou. In other words, if one buys one dou each of domestic and foreign rice from a rice shop, due to the use of volume measurement, the volumes are equal, but the weight of foreign rice is greater than that of domestic rice by one tenth. If one buys one shi each of domestic and foreign rice, using a scale, the weights are equal, but the volume of foreign rice is almost one dou less than that of domestic rice. Customs have been passed down and established as rules, but things are so irrational.</p>
<h3>In Memory of Mr. Liu Jiping</h3>
<p>— Shu Tong</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Jiping passed away in Shanghai on August 25, 1938. His family has scheduled a memorial service at the Fancang Temple on Route Ghisi, French Concession, on January 31, 1941, to mourn him with poetry.</p>
<p>Walking by the banks of the Wu Ni Jing River, Hand in hand, we climbed the Huangye Tower, The home [missing information] filled with bottles, the shelves filled with books, I asked you to stay for one night.</p>
<p>Together, we lamented the red ashes of robbery, And sought refuge in Jiangtian as sojourners, A corner of the market tower was worth buying wine, I remember carrying your shadow to sit in the spring breeze.</p>
<p>Liu San was indeed a remarkable man, Even in the face of national and family ruin, death was sweet, But when the time comes for things to return to [missing information], It makes people remember Jiangnan in vain.</p>
