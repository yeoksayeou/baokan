<p>社評</p>
<h3>德國攻瑞與義國參戰的傳說</h3>
<p>昨晚美國電訉機關的義京羅馬消息，與法國電訉機關的英京倫敦消息，俱傳德國即將進攻瑞典，義國即將參加戰爭。倘若所傳的確，則不但是歐戰的新開展，歐洲的新局面，亦是世界的歷史的畫時代動態。</p>
<p>國際原來正在瞬息萬變之中，國際消息尤極錯綜離奇之致；這些未必盡屬惡意的謠言，或計畫的宣傳，輒因實際上混沌複雜，且每每意外演化，乃至訪者難於捉摸，編者艱於判別，使聞者無法憑信，亦不欲輕於置信；不得已，惟有靜待事實證明。德國與義國在最近將來究何所作為，誰得斷言。</p>
<p>德國攻瑞，義國參戰，實為任何人所不願見聞，雖在德人與義人，亦非例外。蓋弱小國被侵凌，中立國被破壞，戰爭蔓延於和平的領域而擴大；無論目道義上，人道上，國際公法上，安寗秩序與利害關係上，一般觀點，萬無是處。何况瑞義兩國牽入歐戰漩渦之後，其影響絕對不限於瑞義兩國國境，亦即戰爭不僅擴大及於瑞義，行將擴大至於不知所底。就義國而論，原非好戰　武的民族，根本上不願戰爭，必與和平中的任何族類，完全同其意態。更就德國而論，攻瑞雖因別有意願，但樹敵已多，豈願中立的瑞典，因被攻而化為敵人；對於義國參戰之舉，雖所傳為與德國站於同一戰綫，亦即德國將因義國參戰而得一偉大的生力友軍，但德國西南牛壁較弱的國防疆界，原來由義國不參戰而隱然具有最可依賴的掩護，迨義國參戰之後，至少不能不密切關心於這友軍的進退勝敗；故謂德國萬分願意義國參戰，亦非絕無問題。申言之，義國若參戰，若站在德國方面，則在友敵分野上雖友德國而敵英法；在戰事表面形式上雖與德國共勝敗，共休戚，以擊敗英法為共同目標；在軍事上雖强迫英法分散力量，至少在空軍方面由德義合力而自始形成優勢；然問題不盡此在，因義國參戰助德後的戰局形勢，對於目前德國與聯軍所爭持的海陸空三方戰綫，可謂絕無直接的裨補；亦即德國在這一方面未能因此而得義國助力，義國未能因此加强德國戰鬭力。徒然在目前戰綫之外，西北起自法義兩國大陸交界處所，穹然天空，迤東南而迄地中海，成為彼此到處有懈可擊，無險可守，而綿延極長的三軍新戰綫。德國在此新戰綫，殆亦不遑有所裨補，勢惟有以義國單獨的方量，對付英法合力之半。對於若此形勢，推論之為雙方各無絕對制勝的把握，推論之為全局不因此而得短縮戰事時間；我們自信這是「十分中立」的推論。根據此推論，我們更不願見聞義國參戰；但願義國即將參戰的傳說不確。</p>
<p>德國攻瑞與義國參戰，或在任何人不願見聞之中，竟然實現；或有任何人更不願見聞之事，隨之實現。其間較重大且較可能的演進，如蘇聯土耳其西班牙三國，以及東南歐巴爾幹半島各國，不再能保持其中立，相繼挺身而出，拔劍相助；我們暫不研討諸國如何友敵，最後如何勝敗但我們不妨想像若此大規模戰爭的後果。戰爭而若此規模，雖不必更謂美國日本必將不復能自安自外，但瑞義兩國牽入漩渦後，將使歐戰世界化的可能，遠東歐洲兩組戰爭化合為一的可能，必因此而增進。此為全人類打算，眞有不堪想像者。</p>
<p>由上述種種，竊以為德國進攻瑞典，其動機原在戰略方面，性質原屬比較簡單；祗因蘇聯曁歐洲北部其他諸國政治外交關係的並不簡單，德國對瑞，非無終於自制的理由，至於義國參戰，其動機原在政治經濟諸方面，性質原屬比較複雜，決非以所謂履行盟約為參戰原因；却因軍事的見地。義國殆須再經時日，再經玫慮，而後決定；又因政治經濟力面諸問題的解決，性質上不以戰爭為唯一的手段，不以助德為唯一的門徑，故在義國再經時日，再經攷慮之餘，加以英法與德國多方鬭爭之影響，世人對於義國參戰的傳說，應作最大的保留。</p>

<h3>南北美洲築造　世界最長公路　連綿一萬四千英里</h3>
<p>世界最偉大的公路，從北美洲西北角　拉斯加的阜彭克起，直到南美洲東南角阿根廷京城為止，經遇寒帶溫帶熱帶各種氣候，連綿一萬四千英里，若干部份已經造成。美洲國際團體正在加緊進行，以期於一九四二年哥倫布節舉行通車典禮。屆時，這條公路，除啣接阿拉斯加和巴拿馬運河區外，並將直接貫通南北美洲十六國，穿過西半球大陸上的每個共和國。巴西，巴拉圭和烏拉圭三國雖不通過，却將有支路相聯接。</p>
<p>這條公路的建造，係分幾大段進行的。在北部，從阜彭克到西雅圖，長二千二百五十英里，係由阿拉斯加國際公路委員會督造。其路綫尙待勘定，或者將與穿過加拿大西境高原，向北到海慈頓（在阿拉斯加南部邊境以東六十英里）的巳成公路相連接，美國國務院近與加拿大當局已開始談判，以期完成這條公路。</p>
<p>從西雅圖起，巳有一條新式公路，向南穿過美國到墨西哥邊界的諾茄勒斯地方。墨西哥方面擬從這裏起，接造一段經過瓜達拉茄拉，蜿蜓而上，到拔海七千三百九十二英尺的墨西哥京城。這段公路並將與從美國台克薩斯州拉萊度起，向西南行經過墨西哥京城的美洲國際公路相啣接，直達巴拿馬的終點。</p>
<p>段公路擬造到　京南四十英里為止。此後即　美洲國際公路繼續前行一百穴十餘英里，接着就是泥土路　和森林中的狹道。然後通到危地馬拉邊境蘇却德河上的泰列斯曼橋。危地馬拉境內一段公路長三百十二英里，盤繞上山，穿過該國京城，還經過泰瑪蘇拉河上的大橋。這段公路現在已經局部改造，每年只有一部份時期可以行　汽車，有些地段斜坡險峻難行。</p>
<p>其次通過的國家有薩爾瓦多，從康特拉里亞和桑泰安那間的一地起，通到該國京城和桑文生特中間一地止，已有一條五十英里長的公路。從這段起到薩爾瓦多東部的桑密牙，也有一段局部改造過的公路，每年也祇有一部份時期可以通車。預料薩爾瓦多方面對境內一段公路的最後八英里將在年內造成。</p>
<p>汽車開到桑密牙後，須用船駁到巴拿馬，因為洪都拉斯方面雖尤建造境內九十英里長的一段公路，但迄未動工。尼加拉瓜境內約二百六十五英里公路也是如此。科斯達黎加境內擬造的公路長二百六十英里，目下在築造中的祇有七十五英里，該國境內土地崎　，公路完成更感困難。</p>
<p>在巴拿馬國境內第一段通到台維　約六十五英里公路，仍未造成。從台維特起却已有路面粗劣的公路，長五十英里，接着是長二百三十五英里的柏油路。再次是水泥路長十二英里，到巴拿馬運河區的西端為止。此外，美國和巴拿馬將聯合籌劃添造七十英里，從拉却勒拉通達里奧哈土軍用飛行塲。預料巴拿馬當局本年將撥款四五百萬至百萬元建造公路，其中大部份將用以建造美洲國際公路。</p>
<p>美洲國際公路到巴拿馬國境內就終止，向南去便是泛美公路。這兩條公路並不能接通，因為巴拿馬南部和哥侖比亞北部的原野森林中，現在極難造路。照目前的計劃，汽車開到巴拿馬後，須用波船載到哥侖比亞的卡泰基那，或到委內瑞拉的賴圭拉，那裏就有國營公路可通。到哥侖比亞的波哥太，也可有乾燥的公路通達厄瓜多的圭亞奎爾港口，這裏並無陸路通秘魯，但汽車可用船駁到厄瓜多南部的瑪却拉，循乾燥的沿海公路，可到秘魯京城。</p>
<p>從秘魯京城起有兩條公路都可直達阿根廷京城。其一是沿海岸的公路，業已造成，常年可通車。到智利的伐兩巴萊索後，有公路東行，經安第斯山而到阿根廷京城。另一條將為泛美公路的幹綫，從秘魯京城造起，向東南行，經秘魯的寇慈柯，玻璃維亞京城（係世界最高的京城，拔海一萬三千英尺）和阿根廷境內的卓傑埃，特柯憂和科度巴三地，然後到阿根廷京城。這段公路若干部份已可通車。</p>
<p>在墨西哥到巴拿馬的一段公路開工建造前，美國公路局曾估計建築費共須一萬六千萬元，近據泛美公路財政委員會佔計，祗須七千八百萬元，即可完成。其中由墨西哥担任二千二百餘萬元，厄地馬拉，科斯達黎加，和巴拿馬三國各出一千二百萬元左右，其餘由其他各國分別負担。美國對於測量，造橋，及其他工程，所費已有一百十二萬五千元。</p>
<p>公路的建造正在進行中，一般人的關心也在滋長着。美國汽車階級的人們正在殷切期待這公路通車。中美洲各國估計公路落成後，招待往來游客，每年的可增加五十萬元的收人。（譯紐約泰晤士報）</p>

<p>英美期貨均放長</p>
<p>午後無大變動、投機商曾賣與外行四月份美匯為六元〇三一二五、但未幾外行照上價欲出不能、故潛勢遠期較為穩定、迄至收盤、英金仍四便士一二五、美匯六〇三一二五、四月份英美亦為四便士一二五與六元〇三一二五、五月份英金三便士九八四三七五、美匯為五元七八一二五、結果較隔昨午收、現貨英平美緊〇三一二五、四月份英硬〇一五六二五、美則平定、五月份英鬆〇四六八七五、美亦硬〇三一二五、</p>

<h3>金市兔起鶻落　全天有百元上落　結果僅軋小六元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、倐起條落、最高最低、竟差一百元之鉅、情况殊為緊張、其因歐局謠言又興、致後市掀起買風、故結果軋跌無幾、晨初以滙兌報縮、美滙吿緊、開盤即升達五千六百九十元、嗣以證券幫錢兌業傾吐、霎時間降至五千六百二十五元、但為金號見賤猛吸、得提高三十元、豈知證券幫錢兌業續吐不怠、勢所難擋、而斯時美滙轉長、慘破五千六百元大關見五千五百九十元低價、午收賴銀號稍拉、美滙鬆勢略轉、始告穩定、重出五千六百元關外、後市景狀轉好、開後銀號帮　代浮多復進、由五千六百十五元漲至四十元、迨三時許因歐局謠訊、證劵幫入市大搜、立好至五千六百七十五元、惟結果該號忽獲利回吐若干、收盤則吿五千六百五十九元、較上日小六元、全天交易約二千兩有餘、銀樓飾金時高時低、結果平平、海關金等呆定、</p>
<p>烚赤曾進六百元關</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開滙兌報跌、美滙略緊、某錢兌業首來喊買、進證券幫二十兩、為五千六百九十元、比前收拾起二十五元、嗣因證劵幫曁金號等先後乘高力賣、而買戶見勢旁觀、一霎時回小二十元、後再加錢兌業亦來跟塞、而斯時滙市轉鬆、貿戶更少、再跌四十五元、金號出銀號十兩、遜為五千六百二十五元、惟其時金號及散戶拖入、遂步漲三十元、金號進銀號三十兩、為五千六百五十五元、不意其時證券幫見機又賣、復步跌四十餘元、後以美滙續硬、賣風益濃、立破入五千六百元大關、金號進銀號五十兩、為五千五百九十元、將近收盤時、銀號轉賣為買、遂漸吿穩、不久即回至五千六百元大關、錢兌業進余號一十兩、為五千六百十八元、繼而銀號互做十兩、為五千六百十五元、作午收價、午後開市即高五元、錢兌業對做二十兩、為五千六百二十元、後乃錢兌業吐出若干、立回低五元、錢兌業出銀號二十兩、為五千六百十五元、旋金號及銀號帮重代浮多撈進、步步上升、迨三時光景　漲達五千六百四十元、不料其時證劵幫突來猛吸、一時市氣緊張、立好三十五元、證券幫進銀號五十兩、為五千六百七十五元、入後證劵幫忽來復出、市勢立轉、錢兌業互做二十兩、退為五千六百五十五元、三時半金號對做十兩、為五千六百五十九元作晚收價、結果比上日軋小六元、全天一百元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤高數元、收進减低二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>銀樓飾金高低不定</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸五百七十元、迨至九時二十五分掛大五元、未逾半小時即回落五元、十一時反小五元、下午　時半回高五元、結果平平、大同行依然懸五百七十元、新同行與上價相同、收進約减低十五元光景、</p>
<h3>鮮票進一元關</h3>
<p>昨日英美金鎊初因各方供給仍暢、市價繼續下落、後以金價回漲、致亦隨之回平、英金票供求仍勻、市價站穩、美金票始以鎊價續跌一分五厘、晨初高至十六元四角二分、嗣忽各方供塞又殷、一度退至十六元三角一分、午後忽傳歐戰有更將擴大勢、晚市抬至十六元三角七分、比上日軋漲二分、香港票不因港滬滙兌下落而跌、法郞票供給仍旺、市價繼續趨下、荷蘭票及羅比票稍有需求、市價略漲、菲律賓票忽有供給、市價略軟、日金票及朝鮮票供塞又殷、跌風重起、前者復退至一元二角六分五厘、後者已廉過於法幣、晚市降為九角九分、</p>

<h3>證券　外股投機　會德豐與墾殖</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况因補空而引起回風、大都為散戶交易居多、大日元仍有脫手、下午比上午漲勢較勁、買進則浮戶佔多數、昨日掉換交易為多、大通鴻大聯益均係互相掉換、忽進忽出、義泰久豐德孚聯和均有補空、協大永康多頭了結、同康鴻康仁昌脫貨求財、興元同順及三十八號則有現貨流出、統觀全局市價、雖見回漲、但脚地不堅、全日結果一致回漲四角至五角半、成交總數共計約六十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交無錫慶豐紗廠股三十股、價為六十二元正、</p>
<p>眾業昨日股市交易、復經歷極緊張之一頁、開盤市況穩定、不久逐形軟化、終於造成極大跌風、賣戶不顧價格、競謀說手、</p>
<p>關於會德豐無稽謠諑繁興、有謂屬於該公司之各項船隻、會將被英政府所徵發、故該股受創綦重、在層層賣方壓力下、一度低至一百九十四元、嗣有買戶維持、收盤一百九十九元買進、二百零一元賣出、</p>
<p>各執股公司股如國際·揚子·上海等俱因會得豐劇跌、價格亦吿不支、一度下瀉甚鉅、但終各以三十一元半、二十元及三十四元二五等回堅價收盤、</p>
<p>中國墾殖股相反的甚形活潑堅强、其抵禦浮多了結與拋空者之力量驚人、成交十萬五千股、收盤三十一元二五價有極佳需求、賣方所索為三十一元半、</p>
<p>橡皮股受實業股慘跌影響、亦吿不振、但價格方面尙無劇變、</p>
<p>本日因會德豐股跌價、本報又接有署名「李良箴」者為會德豐多頭作遊說、其理由以為「會德豐船隻多屬慢船、且遠在東方、決不能應歐洲軍事運輸之需、即怡和太古等較大之航海運輸船隻、尙未被徵、當不至徵及會德豐駁船」云云、按英國是否徵及遠東商輪、在本市傳說已久、昨則舊話重提、當有事實證明、空言徒亂人意、現下操縱之外股有六七種、凡屬在漲巨跌之股票、皆為投機之明證、翻空翻多、此中作用非常、飛蛾撲火、可為殷鑒、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米續落　西貢米直接運天津</h3>
<p>洋米暴瀉餘勢未殺、蓋賣買雙方、怵於米市變化之烈、恐遭大虧、不敢貿然從事、賣方若原根客販、續謀急脫、而素藉投機之浮囤散戶、心思更淡、手貨悉在廉價推出、而客方雖欲添購、亦無意猝進、他如內地鄕莊客戶祇袖手觀望而已、大局仍呈祇出不進之象、是以喊聲步低、高决各檔莫不一致續跌、小紋米消化最旺、市上籌碼亦比較見多、而行情一度降至四十元、旋以浮空趁低吸收、新囤亦有問津、市乃逐步上展、午後乃昂至四十元零九角、其他西貢暹羅火絞各米初跌後漲、結果均與前日收價相近、惟回籠西貢二號、上午最低仍開五十二元、旋被客囤吸收、收價為五十二元半、反較漲半元、全日成交期貨二百噸、現六千包、</p>
<p>粳糊國米、續到常錫貨七八車、及靑泗南港等貨一千三四百包，銷路因價盤較廉、頗屬活絡、售價與前相仿、無甚榮辱云、</p>
<p>華北食糧、亦被某方造成恐怖景象、故近來大量採購洋米、除本市運往者外、亦向越暹直接訂購、前有挪威商輪Mimei號、在西貢裝儎洋米三萬餘包赴津、經香港時、適値挪國遭歐戰波及、遂被扣留、該輪在港逗留多日、挪輪現已復航、該輪亦於前日（二十四日）、自港起椗赴津、怡和洋行怡生輪、昨晨抵滬、聞自香港裝有洋米一萬一千三百三十一包、日內運往天津、</p>
<h3>麵粉交易殊清　小麥仍趨擯持</h3>
<p>麵粉交易仍淸淡、二號粉廠盤為十三元八角、本街零批不足五千包、老車牌回籠貨價在十三元七角半、亦無甚榮辱、內地雜牌粉除新到一批、今後運輸須加費用、成本加昂、執貨者大都擬扳守以待善價、故交易亦吿沉靜、又麵粉今（二十六日）、有二千一百包、及麩皮七千五百包、運往福建、</p>
<p>小麥廠客買賣雙方、邇來屢見檳持、除送廠貨外、迄無大宗交易、統市僅開常錫一車、價為二十一元、其他中决各貨暫無妥交、市面尙可站立、</p>
<h3>紗花　申新開出雙鳥　五六月期紗二千包</h3>
<p>紗市續挫、跌風稍起、此因實際銷路不旺、而滙兌寗靜、黃金軟化、因之有一部份不要做多頭、惟一般經濟充足之戶、吸收之額非但不願放出、反見在低落時復來加碼、所以遠期貨價殊昂、</p>
<p>現紗晨開承上日之虛氣續進、喊賣者雖多、二十支廠單價為一千四百二十八元做開十包、惟價格一鬆、買者紛至沓來、立刻漲至一千四百五十元、此時現貨價為一千四百七十元、旋聞金價不振、浮多了結、同時現銷牛庸、又見回下十元外、查半日間成交統計一千三百包、行情二十支雙馬現貨跌十五元、廠方　申新九廠開出二十支雙馬二千包、價為一千四百七十元全鈔、五六月期出淸、今日有一百三十七件運靑島、茲將各幫口買去之額量列左、</p>
<p>同行一、一七〇內地一〇</p>
<p>香港一一〇厦門一〇</p>
<p>統計一、三〇〇</p>
<h3>外棉到埠日稀</h3>
<p>本棉交易仍不旺、印美棉成交較增、但廠方絕少舉動、所有生意、皆係同業互相買賣、市面尙屬平定、茲將現棉成交情形列左、</p>
<p>米特林二九四·五〇同行進二〇〇件</p>
<p>大中集二四五·〇〇　二四六·〇〇又二〇〇包</p>
<p>彭家浦二五二·〇〇又二〇〇件</p>
<p>火草包二〇八·〇〇又四〇〇包</p>
<p>北太二一八·〇〇又三〇〇包</p>
<p>白洛去二五二·〇〇又一〇〇包</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日市况軟弱、後因有大衆之賣出、及一部份多頭了結、故收盤市價、近期較之上日降落十餘磅音、遠期較為堅定、跌五六磅音、昨日印度連同預測漲一羅比餘、埃及降落十餘磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、因市上目前銀根奇緊、故交易未能活躍、然因歐局戰事爆發以來、船艘日見减少、故運輸異常困難、日來外棉之到埠日稀、五月起將無到貨、滬上外棉缺乏、乃係實情、按照目前情况、六月中旬將有棉荒之虞廠方近日雖有訂購數千包、俱為五六月份裝船、然屆時是否能有船準期運出、頗屬疑問也、故深信棉價將於五六月中將高漲之虞也、茲將昨日棉市以美滙六元折合送廠價如下、</p>
<p>二十支美米特林二九四·二〇</p>
<p>又又下級二八五·一〇</p>
<p>三支又　　　三一〇·五〇</p>
<p>又又下級三〇〇·二〇</p>
<p>四十支又三一四·二〇</p>
<p>又又下級三〇四·九〇</p>
<h3>雜糧　油價暗削　黃豆再挫元許</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆市况、因環境不利多頭、且油市擯持未開、潛勢巳暗修元餘、故各帮辦胃一致裹足、行情再挫元許、計榨油廠辦去蚌埠豆二車、價為二十三元五角、南京豆二車、價為二十二元、出口去安慶豆三百包、價為二十四元、本街採取蕪湖豆二百包、價為二十元至十九元二角、及平湖杜豆一百二十包、價為二十五元七角至一角、崇明沙黃三百五十包、價自二十一元至二十元零五角云、</p>
<p>豆子今（廿六日）有三百八十包、及豆餅七千四百塊肥田粉二千八百包、俱運福建、</p>
<p>豆油昨由烟台來四百四十聽、又來生油三百聽、</p>
<h3>糖市　車白軋缺見好</h3>
<p>昨粗白復趨疲落、惟B嘜車白以貨缺反升、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白本棧六十三元半、小五角、外棧新貨六十三元二角、三月十八日到貨六十三元一角、小三四角、轉口五十元、小五角、太古車白B嘜西棧七十一元三角、至五角、升五角、DY嘜新貨七十元三角、老貨七十元、HX嘜西棧七十元、荷赤車赤均乏更動、本廠雪白小五角、為六十三元、國糖有廣帮開出北海片靑二百五十包、四十一元半、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲市受制歐戰　駛歐船隻將减少　法國統制進口絲</h3>
<p>昨橫濱無市、紐約近期漲二分、遠期漲四分半、洋行絲交未暢、輯里特絲二千六百五十元、較前市漲五十元、正牌討價二千三百五十元、副牌討價二千二百八十元、中干討價二千一百元、白廠肘價四千九百元、均無成交、蓋歐戰影響、日漸妨礙生絲市塲、例如五月後赴歐郵船减少、此一因也法國統制對外貿易、法國進口絲商不能自由購絲、而必須先行向政府申請、得許可證後、方可照限定之包額結外滙購生絲、此又為一因、是故歐銷前途、常難順利云、二十五日人造絲運香港一百零一箱、</p>
<h3>煤炭　烟煤屑漲十元</h3>
<p>烟煤屑各貨、近因到稀存枯、銷塲轉旺、加之塊煤提高後、下身屑子亦跟蹤抬上十元行情、計做印度煤屑每噸兩百四十元、婆羅洲屑兩百三十元、開平一號屑兩百二十元、二號屑兩白元、基隆屑一百九十元、送到客戶酌加行扛、</p>
<h3>疋頭　秋令花絨嗶嘰　—期貨交易大旺</h3>
<p>國布實銷平淡、月底銀根關係、一部份執貨者脫貨求現、拉進下月份、故市價近廉遠昂、細布細斜每疋拔開二元以上、昨市現貨一致疲落、細布斜紋跌五角至一元、粗布跌二角半至五角、漂染布跌五角之譜、價極混亂、秋令貨印花絨綫呢嗶嘰坯布現墊及期貨交易大旺、達豐廠黑花中柄·水浪絨·現貨開價每碼一元一角、售出二百餘箱、以水浪絨最俏、六月份名利嗶嘰開價每碼一元六角半、手貨現市一元五角、本街囤戶成交最盛客幫尙鮮動辦、又棉布今（二十六日）有一百七十三件、運往福建、</p>
<p>東布晨跌千回、市勢轉堅、十二磅龍頭細布上午低盤售過四十三元八角半、嗣以本街同業及囤戶進意濃厚、乘廉吸收、逐步回升、至晚收盤升漲至四十五元二角半、期貨成交　巨、下月份做開四十七元七角半、四君　嗶嘰現出每碼一元四角一分、期貨一元五角許、</p>
<h3>絲光羽紗　貨缺價昂</h3>
<p>絲光羽紗、昨日市銷頗暢、其售價　絲紗原料高貴、故價上漲二角、昨頭號每碼一律批售二元二角、二號二元、三號一元七角半、叫號一元四五角、大半有行無市、至平光羽紗、國產本廠貨、市銷不若英貨為旺、售盤頭號每碼十元、二號九元二角半、斜花羽紗祇英國製造者一種、別無進口出品、價比平光為貴、然時値天熱時候、實銷已遂步减遜、昨頭號一律批售十元零五角、二號九元七角半、</p>
<h3>南北貨　黑棗久疲回振</h3>
<p>黑棗自疲跌以來、市價已至廉宜、故客方較高之貨、皆守而少出、趨勢遂見轉機、昨聞開出統手黑棗一百數十包、價為三十七元半、比前回升三四元、</p>
<h3>茴香步昂</h3>
<p>茴香近以到存俱缺、市價迭趨高昂、昨號方開出貨品平常、但價格仍高、竟達二百十元、可見堅俏一斑、</p>
<h3>五金　新盤元現貨奇枯</h3>
<p>邇來新盤元因到貨不多、且滬存又薄、洋釘廠需胃仍健、故市面頗覺挺秀、（蓋海外已無貨裝申之故）、行情扶搖直上、反較之本釘高出二三元不等、刻市每擔須售六十五元、而本廠元釘每桶倍司僅喊六十二三元而巳、</p>
<h3>硬鉛絲亦高二元</h3>
<p>白鉛絲（亦稱硬鉛絲）交易、當推天津·靑島·及烟冶帮諸客商為最繁、而本街廠家方面亦時有點綴、近因人心轉硬■故標準售盤又高二元、八號至十六號售五十元、十六號至二十號售五十五元、</p>

<h3>林語堂　與米內「打賭」</h3>
<p>將於明日出版之密勒氏評論、載有林語堂氏致該報一函、略謂、渠敢與日首相米內打賭」、如汪精衛現在能拉攏重慶方面重要人員三人、供彼驅使、則渠願自殺、蓋針對米內宣稱汪精衛「政府」成立後、可「吸收」不少國民政府要員赴南京而發也</p>
<h3>新總統輪　題名核准　九十八日環航一次　每年環航二十六次</h3>

<h3>音樂隊靡費巨款　西報評摘　警務工務需款甚殷　應加挹注以分緩急</h3>
<p>昨日出版之英文金融商報、對十七日納稅外人年會通過工部局一九四〇年度預算案、有所評摘、認爲該局音樂隊全年消費公款二十萬元、祇爲少數愛好音樂者謀快慰、同時工部局警務處及工務處、與公衆關係密切、經費殊有酌增之需要、何不移彼挹此、實所不解、</p>
<h3>挪輪駛滬　均由港啟椗　裝貨件甚多</h3>
<p>挪威商輪業已復航、各情巳誌昨報、茲悉天祥洋行經理之挪輪Tiranna號·Titania號·Talisman號·三輪、前被扣留香港、Talisman號已於前日（二十四日）自港起椗來滬、的今日下午可抵埠、該輪係由美來滬、聞裝來大量貨物、計小白鐵四千餘件、漂粉三百箱、鋼精粉二千二百三十二箱、流酸一百四十九桶、烟葉二千大桶、洋碱粉一千四百五十包、及德士古油一百桶、汽車有六十輛、共計三千九百九十九噸之巨、停靠虹口公利祥碼頭起卸、Titania號、約今日自港開出、預計下星期一（二十九日）可抵滬、Tirauna號、原定二十五日到滬、因前决在港被扣、躭誤日期、昨據天祥洋行消息、該輸爲船期關係、中止來滬、即由香港起綻返國、</p>

<p>新任工部局總董凱自威、日前會正式拜會領袖領事尼龍、茲悉尼氏於昨（二十五）日前往該局答拜總董、當由商團派遣儀仗兵列隊致敬、</p>
<h3>日閣員聯翩來華　視察淪陷區　迄未明瞭其有何意義</h3>
<p>據外人方面消息、日本現內閣厚相吉田茂·鐵相松野鶴本·及拓相小磯國昭大將三人、於上週前來中國、赴日軍佔領下之北平·南京·漢口·廣州各地及戰地前綫視察、此三閣員之來華、適於所謂「阿部特使團」同時、其究係日方固定計劃、抑屬臨時巧合、刻尙未能明瞭意旨、</p>
<h3>西報記者　又被邀赴南京　由日陸軍方面伴同前去</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、南京方面、將於週杪歡迎日本駐在「政權」特使阿部、本市外籍新聞記者一行由日陸軍及大使館兩發言人伴同、今日（廿五日）午後三時乘火車離北站、再度前往南京、採訪新聞、一行計合衆社莫列斯·及安恩·環球公司新聞影片攝影師克萊努柯夫·紐約通報基恩·日內瓦國民日報薩克斯·德國通訊社蘇奇·奧爾森女士·葛林富夫婦·小巴黎人報烏爾·及海通社的韓寄、</p>
<p>今日南京又將有新演出、表面慶祝新「政權」、實係取媚日本派華特使阿部之來寗、對於汪日政治關係、頗有重大影響、阿部來華、有重大任務、或將表示日本開始實行控制之計劃、且阿部旣爲日本軍部訓令之實行者、彼來華後、新「政權必須依據新的、有所作爲、方能　悅日軍部也、</p>
<h3>商會函勸煤球業　顧全大局　愼勿追緊狂潮　藉口一再漲價</h3>
<p>上海市商會昨爲煤球價格事、致函機製煤球業公會云查貴同業所售煤球、半月以來、業已漲價兩次　、雖據報因成本關係、但煤球究爲一般市民燃料所需、關係民生、至爲密切、務勸吿同業、仍以勉維業務、顧全大局爲依歸、愼勿追踪在潮、競趨極度、</p>
<h3>英聯工潮　將再調解　但資方拒不談判　一說有解決希望</h3>
<p>字林報云、楊樹浦路六四〇號英聯船廠罷工風潮之鼓動者若干人、昨（二十四日）日被捕、刻在羈禁中、若輩被捕後未幾、英聯船廠所屬浦東和豐機器廠之罷工風潮即宣布解決、工人均巳復工、英聯船廠之罷工、雖仍繼續中、然有迅吿解決之望、大陸報云、聞諸可靠方面、英聯船廠資方迄今拒不與工人談判、或即將雇用白俄、以代罷工華工、查英聯船廠楊樹浦工塲工人、自三月十四日要求增加工資及米貼起罷工、該廠其他部份工人、亦於上週響應罷工、最近實行罷工者、爲該廠船隻雇工、謠傳工潮即可解決說、未能由負責人士加以證實、聞工潮情勢、仍無變化、即資方拒不與工人談判是、外傳勞資雙方、巳在原則上商獲妥協一說、諒不可靠、因本月初起、迄未從事談判也、昨據工人代表聲稱、勞方仍圖勸使廠方繼續談判、或將央請中立方面、如工部局工業科、出而調停此巳歷六週之爭端、</p>
<h3>本埠存紙甚豐　來源未斷　昂漲原因由於操縱</h3>
<p>紙價昂漲原因、雖多藉口來源稀少、然昨據某紙業中人語記者、此種理由、極屬勉强、僅爲居奇操縱者之托詞、蓋本市存紙迄目下爲止、爲數尙極可觀、現北歐來源雖巳受阻、然自美國輸入者、則逐月增多、如本年二月份自美輸滬紙類共六四·七八二元、至上月即激增至一七七·八七九元、現自美駛滬之船隻、莫不載有鉅量紙貨、故其來源、絕對無虞、</p>

<h3>滬西「特警隊」　一時無成立望　現正起草組織及工作細則　經濟問題雙方意見未接近</h3>
<p>滬西越界築路組織「特警隊」問題、因工部局與偽方意見未趨一致、故自二月間「警務協定」簽訂以來、遷延二月餘、毫無結果、迄至最近、工部局與僞方再度進行商議、據傳該項「特警隊」問題、磋商漸臻成熟、將於下月中成立、茲據負責輿僞方談判之工部局</p>
<p>總巡鮑恩</p>
<p>聲稱、關於滬西組織「特警隊」之談判、最近頗有進展、但該項「特警隊」傳將於下月中旬可以成立之說、恐難實現云、至渠與僞「警察局長」盧英及日顧問五十嵐翠之談判、據渠云、於下月中諒可結束、又悉雙方現</p>
<p>正在起草</p>
<p>關於該「特警隊」之組織及工作之計劃、俟談判結束後、尙有兩難題亟待解決、即人選問題、與經濟問題、而對於後一問題、雙方意見、未見接近、尤難於獲得解決之頭緒、據悉關於經濟問題一項、其爭議之焦點、在</p>
<p>捐稅問題</p>
<p>緣僞方頗覬覦該區內之捐稅、而工部局則決不放棄、且已由工部局捐務處發出通知、該區內本年度夏季房捐及各項捐稅、仍由工部局征收、僞方仍堅持要求、欲攫得此項捐稅、故在短期內、關於越界築路問題、勢難獲得解決、</p>

<h3>法租界　限制任意加租　現從事研究將制定法令</h3>
<p>法國駐滬總領奧齊氏、昨日接見西報記者、表示法公董局對界內房東擅自增加房租、而引起種　惡劣之結果一事、現正從事查究其實况、而將在最近期內、制定一種法令</p>
<p>加以限制</p>
<p>以减少居民之痛苦、奧齊　、自一九三七年中日戰事爆發以來、兩租界人口陡增、房東遂利用機會、於中取利、因此而造成種種糾紛、法公董局有鑒及此、現正謀取解決之道、惟三年以來、此種惡風、雖巳極顯然、但因</p>
<p>調查探討</p>
<p>不無困難、迄今仍未能確定適當　之計劃、以應付此種不合理之現象、今　公董當局已規定限制物價表、其第二步驟、當就房租糾紛問題、發布某種禁令、以謀解決之途徑、惟仍當就日用必需品之飛漲、及捐稅電費之增加等等事實、愼重考慮、然後制定禁令、制止房東投機諜利、增加房客之負担、</p>
<p>房客奮起組聯合會</p>
<p>奧齊氏又稱、十年前、法總領凡登氏禁止房東索取小費、尤嚴禁於房客進屋時、索取一切不正當之費用、但日久玩生、近數年來、禁令玩弛、房租糾紛、遂亦層出不窮、洎乎今日、由於本埠幣價之下跌、其情勢更形嚴重、房東方面、竟有提出荒謬要求、以外幣繳付房金者、法租界內房客、對房東此種措置、業已一致表示强烈反感、並奮起組織房客聯合會、以示對抗、公共租界方面、對此大表同情、且有組織相同機關之趨勢、但效果甚微、當房租糾紛發生、並訴諸法庭時、房東方面往往獲得勝利、此種狀况、如繼續存在、界內秩序、將受極大之打擊、且有愈演愈劇之勢、故法公董局對此種措置、在目前有實行必要也、</p>

<h3>舊報新抄　六十七年前　（三六六）</h3>
<p>（見遜清同治十二年本報）</p>
<p>社倉</p>
<p>社倉之法，昉自朱子，較官倉為美善。官倉即古常平倉，或由官勸紳富捐輸，或每年加厘於錢漕，買米充貯，非奉官示，不能　發，且官亦不能擅發，以蹈賠補之過，必　民間荒呈上詳院司批准，勘災而後可以發倉賑濟。若社會則自鄉耆勸辦，城鄕皆設，雖奉官諭，而實則民辦，蓋明知官倉遇災仍不可恃，故此外又籌立社倉，以為巳成災未辦賑之時所用。發倉散賑，不待申明上憲批准之後，日災未太甚，仍可收價趕赴米多之處，採運接濟於倉中，本錢無所虧缺也。嘗與西人論及此事，極不佩服！且謂籌辦倉米，不如倡開運路，蓋辦倉則米有定限，開路則米有來源，泰西各國，均以此為賑務之第一着，然中國現暫不能行，則惟有倡立社倉，以為災已成賑未辦之接濟。然社倉之設，亦有難焉，故寗詳　辦社倉，設局邀紳，已有半年，而四鄕尙有數處舉辦，城中各捐戶，放棄延宕觀望也。其實不惟寗波，若處處勸辦，各府縣之城中，必不能與鄕間一律。夫朱子社倉之法，仿照常平廣惠而增益之，今之欲立社倉，以義倉多弊病，紳捐民勸，而官為經理之，恐值凶年而仍不足恃，是以謀立社倉也。蓋義倉本為官設，而穀捐自民，自宜紳辦之為善，惟紳辦而仍須請於官，且縣詳上官，諸事均被遷延，官為經理之弊，大都如此也。</p>

<h3>被壓迫的一羣　嚮導女蘭珍的遭遇</h3>
<p>— 忠</p>
<p>嚮導社本身是塊有名無實的幌子，所謂掛了羊顫賣狗肉，這差不多是久居孤島的人，沒有一個不知道的。常少爺先生們在酒足飯飽之後，只知道出了二元一小時的代價，就要享受相常權利的時候，可知道嚮導女們內心所受的痛苦，是在過着非人的生活！</p>
<p>嚮導女的出身，除了極少數是自甘墮落的外，差不多都是由於家境貧寒，不得已被迫州此下策的。住在隔壁三曆擱裹的黃家阿婆的女兒蘭珍，就是被迫走上這條路的一個。據說他們從前也是小康之家，自從在戰事中店誧燬於砲火，丈夫為了生命綫的財產，冒死跑去探視，也就一去不返之後，剩了她們孤苦伶仃的娘兒倆，在這種生活程度高漲的時侯，靠了洗衣服，賣豆板，足足過了九個整月，也算她不客易的了。她們日間洗了整天的衣服，夜裏不能睡覺，還要剝豆板，好預備明日應早市，可是八毛錢的米，不夠她們喝一天的粥，柴價漲得買不起了，求求二房東作點好事，等火爐空時燒點粥，但是房租又過期了。當她們母女倆愁着活不下去的時候，亭子間裏作嚮導女的阿妹，終於折服了蘭珍的傲骨。</p>
<p>蘭珍靠了姿色的秀麗，起初營業的確不錯，但是後來因為蘭珍太自重了，她忘卻了這種職業的眞面目，於是生意逐漸的冷淡下來，飯吃不飽不要緊，但是衣服是借錢也要做的。嚮導社的老闆，一面為了要拉攏她們，一面也是一筆好進帳，借十元大洋，每星期的利錢是二元。借了錢不怕你不做，可是每日的收入卻扣去了大半的利錢。蘭珍雖然知道這是飲鴆止渴，但她終覺得比客人因得到了滿足的代價而贈與的來得清白。</p>
<p>不知怎的，最近蘭珍可變了，一切都變了，活潑天眞的精神變了萎靡，粉紅白胖面龐，也逐漸地慘白消瘦，炯炯如電的眸子，也有點遲鈍起來。但她卻說她沒有病，為了老母，為子生活，她韶得做下去，去忍受那無盡的摧殘，當她在客人面前，裝出了勉強的笑靨時，內心一袋卻湧出了哭不出的血淚！</p>
<h3>為某校舉辦貸款進一言</h3>
<p>— 若</p>
<p>在袱動鑼不定的時竭中，能夠生存在這孤島的上海，巳經算她很徼倖的了。何現我們站在消費方面的學生們，憑着父兄們辛勤所得來供給，同時得浩學校方面努力支持，而得到學習的機會，實在是尤其徼倖的事！因此，我們應該體會現在處境的困苦，努力利用僅有的機會去求深造，這本來是最本份的事。然而，卻有一部份學生——也許是極少數——尚不知自己處境已比一般人優越得多，而埋怨自己的家長們的供給，不足他們學費以外的消耗。須知家畏們的處境，除了極少數擁有富厚資產者外，多數卻是中產以上或他薪俸階級，當這百物騰貴的現在，能夠支持一家數口的生活以外，尙供給子女的教育費，已是很吃力而不客易的事，因此，我捫絕對不能埋怨家長們的。</p>
<p>在進個情形中，我們聽到一個消息，是某校最近因鑒於有一部份同學，他們的家長原是在淪陷區的，恐怕匯款的不便，或是隨該地淪陷而不知消息的，以致斷絕了他們的供給而影響到他們的學業和生活，故有鋸辦貸款，這原是救濟的好辦法。可是因有上述的情形，恐怕另有一部份人不需要貸款而也來一個請求貸借，那麼，這豈不是佔去需要救濟的人的貸金嗎？因此，我希望學校當局定出一個嚴格的審查辦決，第一，請求者的家鄉是否淪陷？那是最要緊的：第二，即使己淪陷，但在未淪陷以前，他們的家長，是否在該地？也要注意的；關於這種種，都應該提出相常的證明。這是恐怕有一部份學生，一方面向家長拿到相當費用，而又一方面向學校貸款，在外胡調濫用，致造成的結果與舉辦的原意大相逕庭。雖然，貸款終須要還的，可是我們不得不事先預防，以免影饗到其他一部份確實需要援助的人呵！</p>
<h3>婢女阿麗</h3>
<p>— 徘徊</p>
<p>「太太饒了我吧！饒了我吧！悲慘而求救的喊聲從隔壁的平房裏傳了出來。我開了窗戶仔細地聽了片刻，這喚聲越來越像那可憐的女孩阿麗的聲音。唉！她實在太痛苦了！她今年只不過七歲，瘦弱的樣子，看來總像是有病似地，並且她那副蒼白的臉上時常流露出一條乾枯了的涙痕，蓬着頭，赤着足，一天忙到晚幫着太太做事，一點空餘底時間都沒有去整理她目己的身子。我記得有一次她太太給了她十餘件衣服，要她在一個鐘頭內都洗乾凈，同時吩咐她洗完後得去煮飯，她一聲不饗地在那裏洗。可是她實在太矮小了，那裏夠得上那高的屋　，去曬她已洗凈了的衣服呢。她再三的將竹竿向上升，纔沒有夠上，站在旁邊的太太非但沒有半點幫助的心理，並且帶着厭惡的神氣，拚命打她，罵她。</p>
<p>這幾月來，太太的手段更惡毒，竟限止這孩子的飯量，而自己卻吃得像肥豬似地整天打牌，看戲。回來有不稱心的事情，老是向這位小朋友出氣。她時常乘太太不在的時候告訴我們：她在二年前有一個最美滿的家庭，沒兄弟姊然，在家裏的確是一位獨一無二的小寶貝。不幸在前年的夏天，她父親因為患有一種急性的病症，竟在數小時內就逝世了。可憐的母親憂急得時常生病，而所有的錢卻已用完了。所以她再三的勸母親將她賣給人家做丫頭，好得幾個錢醫醫母親的病，可是，她母親那裏忍心呢</p>
<p>今年因為實在受到生活的壓迫，才不得不將她賣給了這位太太。她又說：這幾天母親更窮困了，每天睡在巷子口的稻草堆裏過活，有時候她母視來盼望她，可是總遭受到無情太太的毒罵，不許她母親淮門口。</p>
<p>這可憐的小姑娘，不知什時候能夠跳出這悲慘的桎梏呢！</p>
<h3>弄獅者與瘧蚊</h3>
<p>— M.Chin.732</p>
<p>傑克霍華以弄獅著名，常與獅虎為伍。在其弄獅之生涯中，會廈次為獸所襲而負傷，然均告痊愈，以故衆嘗思棄其業。其　臂腹腿間創痕髪　，均猛獸齒爪所遺留也。</p>
<p>其擊友係演蚤戲者，嘗思曉以益　之毒　甚於猛獅與河馬，然霍華則視其言為墻角稽之談。</p>
<p>一日，霍華決意一探　荒，在百獸之天然環意中作實地之觀察。計劃既定，即偕獵者一隊出發至非洲內部，而革影片公司則與此著名之弄獅者相約，如彼能不携鎗械，深入荒野，與獅相值，而能使其驚逸者，則願酬以重金。霍華歡然尤諾結果此驚該之一幕竟告成功，蓋霍華施其神技，竟使猛獅驚惶失措而竄入長草之中。</p>
<p>半月以後，霍華忽病。繆綿數月，瀕死者再。至稍有力氣後，往訪籌求治，醫者診得病人患　甚劇，而其致病之源乃在　蚊之一咬耳。醫者遵照國際聯盟食　疾委員會所規定之方法，施以治療，即每日服奎寗十五喱至二十喱，連服五天至七天，病即告痊，而預防瘧疾，則在熱病流行之時期內每日服奎寗六喱。</p>
<p>瘧疾委員會一九三八年報告書第一百二十五頁鄭重宣稱，在各種預防及治療瘧疾之藥物中，奎寗之用途仍幾最廣，以其功效卓著，不含毒性，而其用法與劑量憶家喻戶曉也。</p>
<p>弄獅者自經此良法治療後，不久即告痊愈，而一俟體力恢稪後，即匆匆離去非洲，不願再作一日之勾留。回抵支加哥後。即往方其演　戲之友人，請之曰：『老友乎，汝之言乃千真萬確。蟲　之害確較猛獅，蓋猛獸僅貿若干創痕於我肌　上，而一體積微小之蚊蟲則幾致我死命也。』</p>
<h3>上帝高於一切　（二）</h3>
<p>這並不是一種有趣的，也不明一處樂觀的情景，我們處在這樣的情景之中，只能責備自己。以歷史上，像這樣的情景，以前也發生過，許多種的社會機構，方樹立起來，不過多時，又崩潰下去，凡屬這樣的事，其原因就在缺乏一種真實的耐久的基礎。希臘曾有過一種傳大的文化，以美為中心，但她忽視了口格。羅馬曾有過一種強大的帝制，以豪勇為基礎，但是她沒有宗敎的信仰。巴比倫曾有過驚人的大商務，但是她缺乏仁茲和善意。所以，這些文化，都不免於崩潰和滅亡。我們現行的社會制度，已在崩潰中了，這個原因，我想是我們不曾　習一個偉大而永久的敎訓，世上只有一條道路，一種哲學，使人得着永久的和平和權能請看創世世大章一節「太初，上帝」這句話，。你便明白這種哲學了。如今世人，多半忘即了這句話，故陷於現在的狼狽。他們不明白拿撇勒人耶穌的大敎訓，和完全的榜樣。耶穌是有生民以來之最偉大者，我們今日認為重要的東西，他實際上就不曾有過。他誔生的馬　，騎的驢，埋葬的墳墓都是向人借用的。他死的時候，羅馬兵士拮鬬分他所有性一財物，就是身上穿的衣服。他的門徒是窮，在物質上，他仍舊讓他們窮。「你們不要積着財實在地上，」「着是人得了全世界，失掉了生命，有什麼益處呢？」這個敎訓我們得學習。耶穌遭遇過經濟的不安定，社會的罪惡，政治的　詐和腐敗，他那時的世界，與我們今日頗相似。但是，在實際上，他未曾具體的說到那些社會問題，豈不令人覺得希奇嗎？那時有許多無衣，無食，無佳的人，又有許多人生病，需要醫治，旁人問問他大聲呼求應付那些迫切問題，但是他說，要應付那些問題，先得解決一個更迫切的問題，就是，「太初，上帝，」這是人生最大的事。耶穌敎訓人，醫治人，宣傳上帝，和他的私生活，在在均以上帝上為先。他以天父事業為首，負起十字架，於上帝懷抱之中完結他肉身的生命，「父阿，我將靈魂交許你。」耶穌的生命，始於上帝，終於上帝。（待續）</p>

<p>那時各人都特別照了一張照片，除了瞿無雙邵慧華兩，報館憶有不少照片子。瞿無雙在席間，又啟口向她們徵求文字，或是在「婦女園地」上發表，或是在「婦女知識」上發表，一聽其便。因她知道她們各有專門之學，而且都能握管作文的，所以有些請求了。就是剛纔的各人都特地別照了一個相，也是有意思的。後人的一篇文字上，冠以她們一個照片，也是近頃很流行的事。這是使讀者讀了她的文章，又可以認識她的芳容咧。各人自然答應了，但不免謙虛一番，說是：「只怕我們文字拙劣，說理不清，寫出不的東西，不能見人吧。」邵慧華又打趣道：「我早知道今晚這一餐飯，諸位姊妹不是能白吃的，果然想出茶樣來，要叫你們做文章了。我人帝位無雙姊妹，拉稿的手段，也是天下無雙。她的拉稿手段，比了從前軍閥時代的拉夫，還要厲害。本來今天這客是我請的，她要搶了去，倘然是我請客，不讓諸位姊妹苦思做文章了。」瞿無雙道：「慧華！你別打扯！我知道諸位姊妹，一定愛護這兩種刋物，能各人賞賜我一篇文章的。」後來這幾個人中，第一個交卷的是吳君紗，請的是敎育與文藝的關係。瞿無雙非常的歡迎，在「女婦知識」雜讀上登出來了。第二個交卷的是金澹雲，她是講婦女社交的，也說得很透澈。她說：東方婦女，有固有之美德，不能盲從西方。這篇文章，有限向家外國雜讀，都翻譯成西文，轉載去了。第三個交卷的是朱愛人，她雖然醫嬰院裏的事情很忙，卻也偷捉工夫的寫了一篇。她這篇文章，是提介普及育兒所託兒所的。最末一個交卷的，誻何家兩位小姐了。產當然寫了籌辦織綢廠的事，近來忙了一點。被套也是她們久在外國，對於用中國文字寫點東西，有點兒不大得勁。倘然敎產用外國文字發表，洋洋灑灑，倒可寫一篇文章。後來還是何雙玉寫成了一篇關於振興中國紡織業的管見，但她覺得文字不好，拿不出來。後來把這篇稿子，寄給吳君紗請她潤色了一下贍後送交瞿無雙，用雙玉儷玉兩人的名發表了。此是後話，暫且表過。（二六八）</p>

<h3>卡通鼻祖——華德狄斯耐　由小小畫師而成世界大藝術家　成功要素不外刻苦力學與深思</h3>
<p>— 海風</p>
<p>「白等公主」長片諧書問世以後，這位偉大的卡通鼻祖——華德狄斯耐的聲譽更爲震動了。也許還是十多年以前的事蹟吧，當時華德狄期耐頗不得志，祇是一個平凡的美國靑年畫師，在一家美術店擔任夜班的職務。偶而無意的發現了奇特的徵象：每當萬籟俱寂的夜深，除了　師的筆不停揮繪寫着的聲音以外，惟有鼠輩在辦公室出沒，盡師對那班老鼠幷不討厭，且感覺與趣起來，他和那班鼠做朋友，把共中十隻養在一個籠裏，每天餵港和牠們遊戲，且敎了一個使牠站立在他的繪版上，做標本。</p>
<p>八年以後，華德狄斯耐的墨水瓶裏產生的米老鼠卡通畫便一嗚驚人地問世了，這是米老鼠的由來，同樣是諧　的淵源，他定名爲米老鼠就和電影革命的有聲電影，同時誕生。在米老鼠進展的過程中，諧畫亦隨之轉變，初次出版一種連集短片叫做「阿麗絲漫游奇境記」的墨水畫影片。</p>
<p>當華德狄斯耐十一年以前在一家報館擔任詼諧畫師的時候，他會和他的兄弟　儀在一九二三年至洛杉磯開辦活動墨水畫公司，他們倆人的合資不過五日元，但他們有很好刻苦的精神與精巧的技能，初次出版的運集短片即爲阿麗絲諧畫。</p>
<p>雖然，這種連集短片始初出版，就很受歡迎，但他仍秉其果毅的態度，堅强的意志，刻苦的精神，聰慧的腦袋，去改良與發展，狄斯耐以爲把一個生動演員介紹上去或可加增興趣。於是他用了複曬的方法把一個女孩活現於那墨水畫片上，這樣做了兩年，成績頗爲完滿，後來又從事製作一種奧斯姆墨水畫短片。</p>
<p>狄斯耐年紀尙輕，他是充滿着靑年熱血的，他的一副熱力，完全在米老鼠身上表現出來，所以米老鼠是一個永生不倦的　潑的動物，在工作時間，若你不是和狄斯耐相熟的，那你就很難在他的同事中認他出來，他雖然是做了老闆，但他不把他的權威來影響他的同事。</p>
<p>據最近的報吿：華德狄斯耐史從事　三張五彩長片卡通『Bameri』的畫片設計，儘量收集小型的登塲動物。其內容如何，請讀者等着瞧吧。</p>

<h3>新華與梅熹之爭執　——因廣告排名引起糾紛</h3>
<p>— 海星</p>
<p>影界新　傳出消息：新華將放棄梅熹。這一定會叫讀者驚奇，試想新華正在戲羅人材，而梅熹又是戰後崛起的一流小生，况且十九日的申新各　新華所刋的全版廣吿上，還　梅熹的四部戲（雁門關，西施，蘇武牧羊，釋迦牟尼）預告，怎麼忽然放　呢？</p>
<p>據說放　的原因，就因那幅廣吿而起。原來梅熹與新華的新合同上，註明廣吿所刊的名字，大小須與女主角一樣，但十九日的預吿戲目中，有一齣「雁門關」，因爲主演人有袁美雲梅熹龔秋霞三個，所以梅熹的名字排得比袁美雲小了一點，梅熹翌日即致函新華主人張善琨，認爲此舉與合同不符，如無善後辦法，擬即中止工作。</p>
<p>張善琨接信後，以爲梅熹所爲，未免不近人情，即表示願意放棄梅熹，即使梅熹封未完成的「西施」不願續拍，也並無不可。新華的理由是：梅燾在戰後所得的報酬，是月薪一百三十元，而幾次加薪，現在連酬勞每月巳可得七八，自元，同時新華並尤許他裕別家公司工作，而獲得意外報酬，則新　所待梅熹者，可謂不薄、這次廣吿排名，新聞報所刋的四部預吿，有三部都是與女主角一般大小，而申報大美所刊，則史是四部一樣，可見這是手民的疏忽，決非新華故意不履行合局，而梅熹忽然扳起面孔，不免太小顧舊情。張善琨斷然而言曰：「要用　種手段對付我，我就願意放棄，不論他是什麼大明星！</p>

<h3>Fierce Battle Near Gaoping; Japanese Army Suffers a Complete Collapse; Over 5,400 Japanese Soldiers Killed or Wounded; Japanese Forces Near Zhengzhuang and Xingyu Nearly Annihilated</h3>
<p>Tongguan - Japanese forces near Gaoping, which had advanced from Changzi and Changzhi, suffered heavy losses in repeated attacks by the Chinese army. On the morning of the 23rd, the Japanese reinforced their forces to over 10,000 and continued their fierce attacks on the Chinese. The Chinese forces, positioned at Sanjia Village and Bushang Village (both north of Gaoping), launched an encirclement from three sides. Japanese corpses littered the fields, and blood flowed like rivers. By evening, Japanese casualties had reached over 5,400. A unit of the Chinese army circled around to near Dasheng Town and launched a pincer attack, causing the Japanese to suffer a complete collapse and retreat northward in disarray. No trace of the Japanese remained near Gaoping, and the great annihilation battle was declared complete. The Chinese army is currently pursuing and annihilating the remaining Japanese forces. (Dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<p>Xi'an - At noon on the 21st, according to a pre-determined plan, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on the Japanese forces who had penetrated near Zhengzhuang (northeast of Qinshui). After a day of bloody battle, the Japanese abandoned over 680 bodies and retreated northwestward in disarray. The Chinese forces are vigorously pursuing. In this battle, the Chinese captured eight machine guns, over 160 rifles, and a large quantity of other military supplies. (Dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - A spokesperson for the Chinese military stated that since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese army had been attempting to drive out the Chinese forces stationed in the Zhongtiao Mountains and Taihang Mountains. Therefore, they have recently intensified their attacks. The Japanese army, currently advancing along nine routes simultaneously, is engaged in battle with the Chinese forces along a 150-mile-long front line extending from Maojindu to the Yangtze River and Huguan Pass. The Japanese began attacking Maojindu on April 17th. While the Japanese army attacked the front lines of the Chinese army, the Chinese army simultaneously adopted a strategy of attacking the rear of the Japanese army. (Dispatch from the 25th, Associated Press)</p>
<p>Luoyang - The Japanese forces, advancing southward from Changzhi and Changzi along five routes, reached the line between Shese Village and Macun, northwest of Gaoping, on the 23rd.

<p>Luoyang - The Chinese army recently achieved a major victory on the Yi-Qin Highway, comparable to the victory at Dahui (southwest of Lingchuan). On the night of the 22nd, over 700 Japanese troops from Xingyu, southwest of Qinshui, took covert action to raid eastward. The Chinese army had detected this in advance and set up an ambush in a pre-determined location. They also deployed a large force to vigorously intercept the Japanese army near Laomu Tomb. After a night of fierce fighting, the Japanese suffered heavy losses. At dawn, the remaining Japanese could not hold on and retreated westward. The Chinese ambush troops rose up and intercepted them, trapping the Japanese in the Chinese encirclement. After resisting stubbornly until noon, the majority of the Japanese were annihilated by the Chinese army. Fewer than 100 survived. Many Japanese cannons and supplies were abandoned. The Chinese army has captured Xingyu Village and is pursuing in triumph. In addition, the Japanese forces in Qinshui, under the cover of continuous artillery fire, invaded Yangcheng and engaged in a major battle with the Chinese army in the suburbs.

<p>Xi'an - On the morning of the 21st, the Chinese army, advancing from the Maojindu area toward the rear of the Japanese army, engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese reinforcement troops near Huaixia Village and Xuecun Village. After fighting fiercely until noon, the Japanese army collapsed and retreated. The Chinese army is currently launching a fierce attack on the rear of the Japanese army in a certain area. (Dispatch from the 24th)</p>
<p>Luoyang - In the Jin-Nan triangular area, the Chinese army is still engaged in a general offensive. At Yandi and Maojindu (east and west) and on the northern and southern fronts, the Chinese army has annihilated no fewer than 1,000 Japanese troops in continuous battles. In retaliation, the Japanese army mobilized over 6,000 troops on the 22nd and launched a major offensive eastward against Wangyuan Village. The Chinese army fought bravely to meet the attack, and after half a day of fierce fighting, the Japanese were unable to succeed and retreated westward at noon. The Chinese army pursued and intercepted them, and a bayonet fight broke out near Yandi, resulting in more Japanese casualties. The battle with the Japanese reinforcements is still ongoing. (Dispatch from the 24th)</p>
<h3>Heavy Casualties Among Japanese Troops Attacking Yin Jia Hui</h3>
<p>Fuliang - On the 22nd, Japanese troops from Guichi, southern Anhui, launched an attack near Gu Jia Hui.

Subsequently, they were reinforced and launched another fierce attack, and the bloody battle near Baiyang was still ongoing until late at night. (Dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Army in Eastern Shandong Recaptures Taibaobao Village</h3>
<p>A Certain Location in Shandong - On the morning of the 20th, the Chinese army in Shandong Province launched a fierce attack on the Japanese forces near Tengxian County and engaged in a fierce mountain battle with the Japanese near Majiayu. The brave and valiant Chinese soldiers, based on the principles of mobile warfare, lured the Japanese to the mountainous area northeast of Majiayu and encircled them for a fierce attack. After fighting fiercely until noon, the Japanese suffered over half casualties. The remaining Japanese troops fled in panic and were unable to escape the encirclement. They are currently being annihilated. Another unit of the Chinese army has advanced to near Nanhe and is blocking the Japanese reinforcements who are arriving from Majiayu. (Dispatch from the 25th)</p>

On the morning of the 11th, a unit of the Chinese army attacked Taibaobao Village (northeast of Anqiu) and engaged in a bloody battle with the Japanese forces near Taibaobao Village. After fighting fiercely until noon, the Chinese army used a portion of its forces to launch a pincer attack on the rear of the Japanese army. The Japanese could not hold on and fled in disarray. The Chinese army recaptured Taibaobao Village and destroyed over 100 zhang of the Jiaoji Railway between Gaomi and Weixian. (Dispatch from the 25th)</p>

The city was attacked by Japanese aircraft on October 2nd of last year. The Japanese aircraft subsequently dropped many bombs in the suburbs of Chongqing, but the details are not yet known. The Japanese aircraft did not actually appear over Chongqing City, so most of the residents who had taken refuge in the air raid shelters were unaware of the bombing. A reporter observed the air raid from outside the air raid shelter. At 2:30 AM, the sound of aircraft whirring could be heard clearly in the distance. Suddenly, ten flashes of light illuminated the sky, and everything within several miles was as bright as day. Then, the sound of bombs exploding in the west could be heard faintly.

<p>Chongqing - A spokesperson for the Chinese army announced that this morning, Japanese aircraft twice bombed the outskirts of Chongqing and also attacked Xining, 100 miles northeast of Chongqing.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Rumors of Germany Attacking Sweden and Italy Entering the War</h3>
<p>Last night, American news agencies in Rome, Italy, and French news agencies in London, England, both reported that Germany was about to attack Sweden and Italy was about to enter the war. If these reports are true, it would not only be a new development in the European war and a new situation in Europe, but also a watershed moment in world history.</p>
<p>The international situation is constantly changing rapidly, and international news is extremely complex and bizarre. These rumors, which may not all be malicious or planned propaganda, often arise from the actual chaos and complexity of the situation and its frequent unexpected developments. As a result, they are difficult for reporters to grasp, difficult for editors to judge, and impossible for readers to believe or even want to believe. Inevitably, one can only wait for the facts to prove themselves. What Germany and Italy will actually do in the near future, no one can say for sure.</p>
<p>Germany attacking Sweden and Italy entering the war is something that no one wants to see or hear, even Germans and Italians are no exception. The invasion of a small country, the destruction of a neutral country, and the spread of war into peaceful territory are all wrong from the perspective of morality, humanity, international law, order, and self-interest. Moreover, after Sweden and Italy are drawn into the whirlpool of the European war, the impact will definitely not be limited to the territories of Sweden and Italy alone. In other words, the war will not only expand to Sweden and Italy but will expand to an unknown extent. As for Italy, it is not a war-loving or martial nation and fundamentally does not want war, and its intentions must be completely the same as those of any nation in peace. As for Germany, although attacking Sweden is due to other motives, it already has many enemies and would not want a neutral Sweden to become an enemy because it was attacked. As for Italy's entry into the war, although it is reported that it would stand on the same front as Germany, which means that Germany would gain a great new ally because of Italy's entry into the war, the weaker southwestern border of Germany's national defense was originally implicitly protected by Italy's non-participation in the war. After Italy enters the war, it cannot but closely concern itself with the progress and victory or defeat of this allied army. Therefore, to say that Germany is extremely willing for Italy to enter the war is not without its problems. In other words, if Italy enters the war and stands on Germany's side, it would befriend Germany and oppose Britain and France in terms of friendly and enemy divisions. In terms of the surface form of the war, it would share victory, defeat, and fortunes with Germany, with the common goal of defeating Britain and France. In military terms, it would force Britain and France to disperse their forces, at least initially forming an advantage in the air force through the joint efforts of Germany and Italy. However, the problem does not end here, because the war situation after Italy's entry into the war to help Germany would provide no direct benefit to the three fronts of land, sea, and air that Germany and the Allied forces are currently fighting for. In other words, Germany cannot gain Italy's assistance in this aspect, and Italy cannot strengthen Germany's fighting power. It would only create a new and extremely long three-army front outside the current battle line, starting from the point where the continental territories of France and Italy meet in the northwest, encompassing the vast sky, extending southeastward to the Mediterranean Sea, where each side can attack everywhere and there is no danger to defend. Germany would probably not be able to supplement anything on this new front and would have to rely on Italy's own strength to deal with half of the combined strength of Britain and France. Regarding this situation, inferring that neither side has an absolute certainty of victory and inferring that the overall situation will not shorten the war time as a result is, we believe, a "perfectly neutral" inference. Based on this inference, we do not want to see or hear of Italy entering the war. We hope that the rumors of Italy's impending entry into the war are not true.</p>
<p>Germany attacking Sweden and Italy entering the war may be realized despite being something that no one wants to see or hear. Or something that anyone wants to see or hear even less may be realized as a result. Among the more important and possible developments are that the Soviet Union, Turkey, and Spain, as well as the countries of the Balkan Peninsula in southeastern Europe, will no longer be able to maintain their neutrality and will successively stand up, drawing their swords in aid. We will not temporarily discuss how these countries will befriend or oppose each other or how they will ultimately win or lose, but we may as well imagine the consequences of such a large-scale war. A war of such scale would not necessarily mean that the United States and Japan would no longer be able to remain safe and aloof, but after Sweden and Italy are drawn into the vortex, the possibility of the European war becoming globalized and the possibility of the war in the Far East and the war in Europe merging into one would inevitably increase as a result. This is something that is truly unimaginable from the perspective of all mankind.</p>
<p>From the above, I believe that Germany's attack on Sweden was originally motivated by strategic considerations and was relatively simple in nature. However, because the political and diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and other countries in northern Europe are not simple, Germany has reasons to ultimately restrain itself from attacking Sweden. As for Italy's entry into the war, it was originally motivated by political and economic considerations and was relatively complex in nature. It was definitely not due to fulfilling a so-called alliance that it entered the war, but due to military considerations. Italy would probably need more time and more consideration before making a decision. Moreover, because the political and economic problems could be solved by means other than war and by routes other than helping Germany, and in view of the influence of the various struggles between Britain and France and Germany, the world should treat the rumors of Italy entering the war with the greatest reservation.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Military Plans to Implement Authoritarian Economic Experiments: Strict Plans to Limit Price Increases; Business Circles Believe This Will Cause Harmful Effects</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The Japanese Army Ministry, in view of rising prices, plans to implement strict plans to reduce prices in Japan. Industrialists fear that this economic experiment may cause harmful effects, and they express deep concern about the general situation. The Japanese military and capitalists have long held differing opinions on economic policy. This week, army leaders held a three-day meeting to discuss limiting profits in order to reduce general prices. Business and industrial figures previously believed that most military leaders came from rural areas and had limited knowledge of the complex situations of modern finance and economics. In 1936, General Terauchi Hisaichi, then the Minister of the Army, made a statement saying that it was easy for the government to raise money, just by issuing an unlimited amount of public bonds, which caused extreme turmoil at the time. Bankers and businessmen are extremely uneasy about the Army Ministry's economic experiments. Many of the difficulties in North China are also due to military interference in commerce and finance. The financial world is particularly surprised by the current new plan of the military. The financial world believes that the military's idea of limiting profits to reduce the price of munitions and other manufactured goods is too simple and ignores the current situation of Japanese industry. The industrial world believes that strict price controls will encourage illegal transactions, and their prices will inevitably be higher than those stipulated by the government. The urgent problem to be solved at present is the distribution of goods, and it is necessary to obtain raw materials and labor. They stated that the economy must be fundamentally resolved based on the main reasons, otherwise, if authoritarian methods are used to strictly limit the rise in prices, the effect is feared to be limited. According to the military's plan, munitions merchants can only obtain enough profits to continue their business. The military has not yet decided what the profit limit should be. They plan to establish a five-year average plan to accumulate the profits earned, but no concrete decision has been made. The Price Control Bureau was established long ago, but the regulations for managing prices have been repeatedly violated, so a "black market" has emerged. Merchants stipulate the price of goods, but raise the price during the transaction. Due to the prosperity of the munitions industry and inflation, many people with ample funds are willing to buy rare goods at high prices. The Royal Bank of Canada recently stated after investigating Japanese finance that Japan's wartime economic situation will inevitably lead to price inflation and a deterioration in living standards. Government officials acknowledge this phenomenon, so they support limiting profits. Minister of Commerce and Industry Ginjiro Fujiwara stated, "I believe that if we implement restrictions on profits, we will encounter various difficulties." (United Press report on the 25th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Japanese Central Price Committee held its second round table meeting yesterday. Prime Minister Yonai and several cabinet members, as well as many key figures from the financial and business circles, attended and participated. The main topics discussed were cracking down on illegal transactions, increasing production, and maintaining prices at the same time. Interior Minister Kodama and Justice Minister Kimura both expressed their opinions, saying that although the government authorities have strictly controlled them, illegal transactions still exist in various places, but it is said that the number of transactions has not continued to increase. The committee then decided that the government authorities should promote "economic morality" and strictly stipulate punishment measures to serve as a warning. (Havas report on the 24th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - According to various newspapers, the amount of banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan reached 33.2 billion yen by the end of last month. It is expected that the amount issued in the first half of this year may exceed 40 billion yen, breaking the record of 38.1 billion yen at the end of last December. Although the newspapers warned the government to prevent malignant inflation, they said that cash transactions are very active recently, and prices are rising continuously, coupled with other seasonal factors, the increase in the amount of banknotes in circulation is not surprising.

<h3>Representatives of the Japanese Spinning Industry Active in Australia: Okawa Talks About the Purpose of Visiting Australia: Plans to Import Large Quantities of Wool</h3>
<p>Sydney - Okawa, the director of the wool purchasing section of Kanegafuchi Spinning Co., Ltd. in Osaka, visited Australia in the name of a representative of the Japan Wool Spinning Industry Association. He made a statement here, saying that he came to Australia to try to ensure that a large source of Australian wool is continuously transported to Japan. The company he represents has eight wool factories in Japan, four factories in China, and one factory in Manchuria, as well as 26 cotton spinning factories, employing more than 40,000 workers in total. He hopes to meet with many Australians to discuss and create closer friendly relations between the two countries. In addition to his business mission, he hopes to become a non-official goodwill ambassador. In view of the past trade relations between the two sides, he asked Australia to show a slightly friendlier attitude towards Japan, and he thinks that Australia should not consider his hope as excessive. Japan has become a highly industrialized country in the past few years, but Japan's material resources are limited. In order to maintain its status as an industrial country, it has to seek the supply of raw materials from other countries. Japan is willing to cooperate with Australia to promote mutual benefits. Japan knows that Australian wool is suitable for Japanese industry, and the Australian people can also understand the appropriateness of the prices offered by Japanese manufacturers.

<p>Washington - The Army Department has decided that when 70,000 soldiers of the Army conduct exercises in Louisiana and Texas next month, no foreign military attaches will be invited to observe. The US "streamlined division" will also participate in its first exercise in peacetime as a field army. The person in charge explained the reason for not inviting foreign military attaches, saying that the observation site is too small to properly accommodate foreign military attaches. (Reuters report on the 25th)</p>
<p>Washington - The US Army Department announced last night that the US Army will hold large-scale exercises from May 11 to 25, and will not invite military attaches from various countries stationed in the US to participate. According to non-official sources, the motive for this statement is because the US Army Department does not want foreign military experts to understand the latest technical equipment of the US Army. Moreover, when a certain European country held exercises last year, it also did not invite US military attaches to participate. (Haitong News Agency report on the 25th)</p>
<h3>Pittman Advocates Building a Large Navy</h3>
<p>Washington - Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman told reporters today that the United States must maintain a strong navy, sufficient to defend the Western Hemisphere without the aid of Britain and France. He said that the United States should have the strength to defend the Western Hemisphere, so as not to be a protectorate of Britain and France forever. (Haitong News Agency report on the 25th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Japanese newspaper "Yomiuri Shimbun" published an article commenting on the speech by Rear Admiral Taussig, commander of the Ninth Naval District of the United States, believing that Taussig's speech was crazy and absurd, and Tokyo could ignore it, just like dealing with US Secretary of State Hull's statement on the Dutch East Indies issue. Moreover, the "Kokumin Shimbun" stated that Taussig's speech was another threat to Japan from the United States. Taussig has probably regarded Japan as the imaginary enemy of the United States. Such a speech is truly appalling. The newspaper also said that although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs completely ignored it, such crazy remarks occurred repeatedly, which could also make the situation serious.

<p>Rome - The Roman newspapers are paying close attention to the Allied conspiracy to expand the war and the efforts to repair relations with Italy. According to a dispatch from London carried by "Il Giornale d'Italia," the London newspapers are focusing on the threat to Yugoslavia. The British newspapers are publishing this kind of argument in order to make Yugoslavia accept its promise of assistance, but this kind of promise cannot be trusted. The newspaper continued to carry a dispatch from Paris stating that people in French political circles are focusing on discussing the Mediterranean issue. The commentary of "Le Matin" said that if Italy interferes, it will give the Allies an opportunity to attack Germany. (Haitong News Agency report on the 25th)</p>
<p>Swiss Capital - According to observers in Berlin, Germany no longer hopes that Italy will directly assist in military operations, at least for the time being, but is very impressed by the spiritual cooperation given by the country, and believes that this cooperation will become closer in a short period of time. The observers also said that there is indeed a group of people in Italy who advocate assisting Germany in the war, but these people do not have the power to influence the government authorities. (Havas report on the 25th)</p>
<p>London - Well-informed sources here today spoke to Reuters reporters regarding reports of Allied guarantees to Sweden that they would immediately provide assistance in the event of a German invasion, saying that any new act of aggression by Germany, wherever it may occur, will be a matter of immediate concern to Britain and France. At the same time, it cannot be determined that the Allies have made any special guarantees to Sweden at present. (Reuters report on the 25th)</p>
<p>Belgian Capital - A military affairs reporter for the "La Nation Belge" recently commented on the military situation in Northern Europe, stating briefly that the concentration of German troops in various ports on the Baltic coast is intended to invade Sweden, with the Port of Luleå as the target. The port is connected to the Kiruna iron mine by railway. If Germany occupies it, it can seize a large amount of iron ore, and can continuously obtain a supply of ore through the sea route during the summer thawing of the Gulf of Bothnia. It can also use this railway line to dispatch fresh troops to reinforce Narvik Port in Norway. For the sake of the British and French Allied forces, it is necessary to prevent it by all means, and if necessary, the hydropower plant at Lake Torneträsk can be destroyed. The machinery of the Kiruna mine and the railway traffic of the Port of Luleå both rely on the plant to supply electricity. (Havas report on the 24th)</p>
<p>Italian Trade Union Council Discusses Diplomacy</p>
<p>Rome - The Italian Fascist Trade Union Council today discussed diplomatic issues. Cianetti declared that Italy's enemies are the plutocratic politics that rule Britain and France. He believes that the Foreign Minister should prepare a map detailing the living space needed by Italy in the Mediterranean, including Gibraltar, Malta, Haifa, Cyprus, and Viserta. (Haitong News Agency report on the 25th)</p>
<p>The Iron Ore Issue is a Crucial Key</p>
<p>Swedish Capital - Political observers here recently said that the iron ore issue is still the key to the war in Northern Europe. Once the Gulf of Bothnia thaws, German troops may finally invade Sweden in order to control the iron mines in the north of the country. Otherwise, Germany may occupy the Aland Islands (currently owned by Finland) at the end of May this year, that is, on the day when the Gulf of Bothnia and the Swedish Port of Luleå are completely thawed. In this way, on the one hand, the country can rely on the islands to directly threaten Sweden and force it to supply iron ore. On the other hand, it can set up an air force base there and send aircraft to escort German ships transporting iron ore. But one thing that cannot be ignored is that the islands are located at the mouth of the Gulf of Finland. The Soviet Union has always regarded the sea area there as its sphere of influence. If Germany occupies them, the attitude of the Soviet Union is worthy of attention. (Havas report on the 24th)</p>

Chamberlain replied that if this hypothetical situation is realized, the British government will take the actions necessary for the safety interests of the Allies. (Reuters report on the 25th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam - Regarding the statement issued by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons, that if neutral countries are attacked in the future, the Allies will take measures to protect the overseas interests of the attacked neutral countries, it confirms Britain's unwillingness to stand idly by if the Dutch East Indies are involved in the war. Regarding the issue of Iceland and Greenland, British Foreign Secretary Butler said that Britain and Canada are now considering their future in detail. (Haitong News Agency report on the 25th)</p>

<h3>British Aircraft Repeatedly Raid German Sylt Island; German Patrol Ship and Motorboat Sunk; German Airfields Within Denmark and Norway Continuously Bombed</h3>
<p>London - News from the airfield west of Sylt Island reports that on Tuesday, it was subjected to a relentless bombing raid lasting one hundred minutes by British aircraft. German air force bases in Aalborg, Kristiansand, Oslo-Fornebu, and Stavanger were also attacked. The scope of operations was extensive that night, with a large number of British aircraft participating. It is reported that only two did not return to base. The airfield west of Sylt Island suffered its first major attack since the war began. The British aircraft involved were long-range bombers. One hangar was repeatedly hit, and another was heavily damaged. The airfield runways were bombed repeatedly, with several fires breaking out. The first British bomber encountered only minor intense gunfire, but as the British aircraft unleashed a major bombing, anti-aircraft guns around the airfield fired continuously. In the attack on the Stavanger airfield, about twenty enemy aircraft were bombed before dawn, most of which were destroyed. The airfield ground, already riddled with holes, was further damaged by this intense bombing. One British aircraft flew low to drop a bomb, which exploded beside the runway, creating a sudden burst of light. The British aircraft attacking the Kristiansand airfield focused on the runways and buildings, achieving many hits. Despite intense ground fire, the British aircraft managed to evade it. The Fornebu airfield near Oslo was also heavily bombed. A British aircraft, en route to Fornebu, spotted two enemy ships heading north, not far from the mouth of the Oslofjord. The aircraft dropped two bombs on them, which exploded alongside the first ship. The aircraft then descended to less than 150 feet above the water, opening machine-gun fire on the ship as it sped towards the shore. This was the fourth British air raid on Aalborg. The weather was excellent, with clear skies and a bright moon. Looking down on the airfield, no enemy aircraft were visible, but the defenses were strong, with gunfire filling the air and searchlights sweeping the area. Nevertheless, the British aircraft dropped bombs, achieving many hits. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>London - The War Office issued a war report stating that British aircraft flew to the Westerland airfield on the German island of Sylt last night and bombed it heavily for an hour and a half. During the raid, a German patrol ship and a motorboat were sunk. At dawn today, another group of aircraft flew to Stavanger in Norway and bombed a German aircraft depot. At the time, twenty German aircraft were parked on the field, some of which were destroyed or damaged. German airfields in Kristiansand, Norway, and Aalborg, Denmark, were also bombed by our aircraft and suffered damage. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The German official news agency reported on the British air raid on Sylt, stating that the British aircraft dropped about ten bombs. Military targets were not hit, but other material was slightly damaged. Several British aircraft attempted to fly into the western coast of Schleswig-Holstein and dropped some bombs, but they all landed in fields and caused no damage. (Reuters, 24th)</p>

<h3>British Intelligence Service Expands Authority; Manages Postal and Telegraph Censorship</h3>
<p>London - British Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons today that Monckton has been appointed Deputy Minister of Information, also serving as Assistant Secretary in the Foreign Office, effective immediately. Chamberlain stated that the government, based on its experience, has decided that the Ministry of Information should assume the functions currently exercised by the Press Censor Bureau. To enhance coordination between the military and the Ministry of Information, the number of senior military personnel serving in the Ministry of Information will be increased, and representatives of the Ministry of Information will also be added to the military. Monckton's concurrent appointment as Assistant Secretary in the Foreign Office is to ensure that the Foreign Office's propaganda division, responsible for propaganda in neutral countries, cooperates with the Foreign Office's division for propaganda against the enemy. All matters of postal and telegraph censorship, previously managed by the War Office, are now under the control of the Ministry of Information. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3>Dutch Government Announces Press Regulations</h3>

<h3>French Arms Production Dramatically Increases, Minister of Armaments Reports</h3>
<p>Paris - The Armaments Committee of the Chamber of Deputies held a meeting this afternoon, during which Minister of Armaments Dautry delivered a speech, stating, "The quantity of our country's arms production has dramatically increased and is sufficient to cope with all contingencies. The production of some factories has increased tenfold, which was unexpected. Minister of the Navy Campinchi delivered a speech to the Finance Committee, stating that the current shipbuilding program will be completed by 1944, with a total cost of 130 billion francs. In short, even if our current fleets are unusable by 1944, our naval strength at that time will at least be on par with the present." (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>Anglo-Soviet Trade Negotiations Still Deadlocked; Soviet Union Considering British Conditions</h3>
<p>London - Soviet Ambassador Maisky met with Foreign Office official Butler yesterday for consultations. Political figures here have said that this move must be related to the reopening of trade negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union. The government has presented the Soviet Union with a note explaining one of the conditions under which Britain should proceed with negotiations, but so far Ambassador Maisky has not responded because he has not received instructions from his government. It is generally believed that Ambassador Maisky's visit to British diplomatic authorities was to reiterate the Soviet government's complete adherence to political "neutrality." Soviet sources said that Ambassador Maisky's talks with official Butler yesterday were of a general nature. At the same time, Ambassador Maisky must have reiterated the Soviet Union's policy of neutrality. In short, after Germany expanded its influence toward the Scandinavian Peninsula, the Soviet Union has indeed felt uneasy. If Germany were to achieve victory in Northern Europe, the Scandinavian Peninsula would be constantly under its control, and the Soviet Union's lines of communication to the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean would be threatened. For this reason, the Swedish government's refusal to allow German soldiers and munitions to transit its territory to Norway is supported by the Soviet Union. However, under these circumstances, it is doubtful whether Britain and the Soviet Union can conclude a commercial agreement. What Britain is demanding is that the Soviet Union limit the amount of goods that the country exports to Germany, as well as the amount of goods from other countries that transit the Soviet Union to Germany. It is uncertain whether the Soviet government can comply with this. If the Soviet Union accepts British demands and concludes a satisfactory commercial agreement, it would undoubtedly be a major shift in that country's policy. In short, where the country goes from here, will soon be demonstrated by facts. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>British Government Vigilant Against Anti-War Activities; Home Secretary Responds to Questions in the House of Commons</h3>
<p>London - Home Secretary Anderson declared in the House of Commons today, in response to questions, that he has been closely monitoring the activities of a few people and feels that some of them seem intent on hindering the war effort. Because the nation is determined to exert all our strength in this war, the above activities have had little practical impact so far. However, the potential consequences of continuous attempts to hinder the war effort cannot be ignored. (Cheers) The freedom permitted by traditional British principles may be abused by extremists, some of whom are eager to destroy this freedom. Anderson concluded by saying that he is currently considering whether there is a need to strengthen existing regulations in order to curb activities that specifically tend to hinder the national war effort. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<h3>Germany Bans Recreational Travel</h3>

<h3>German Counter-Offensive at Trondheim; Attempts to Prevent British and French Forces from Advancing South; British Fleet Bombards German Positions at Narvik; Fierce Fighting in the Steinkjer Area</h3>
<p>Berlin - Authoritative sources claim that two British battleships, several cruisers, and many destroyers bombarded the city and harbor of Narvik yesterday for a long time, causing considerable damage. However, there was no loss of German forces. New positions have been constructed. Although British warships have bombarded Narvik for days, there has been no attempt to land. (Haitong, 25th)</p>
<p>Berlin - According to sources here, a small unit of German troops near Trondheim captured a position with six machine guns. The German troops suffered no losses. (Haitong, 25th)</p>
<p>Stockholm - The "Aftonbladet" newspaper recently published news from Røros, Norway, stating that fresh Allied troops are continuously arriving in Lillehammer. The combined British, French, and Norwegian forces total 17,000 personnel. Allied forces are also continuously landing in Narvik. The fighting is quite fierce in the Steinkjer area. In addition, an air raid alarm was issued once in Kiruna, Sweden, in the Swedish iron ore region, but no aircraft appeared. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Stockholm - Yesterday, advanced units of British troops and German forces carrying military weapons, assisted by tanks and armored vehicles, engaged in battle in the Steinkjer area. Intense artillery fire continued until late at night. It is reported that two German destroyers and one light cruiser penetrated into the inner harbor of Trondheim Bay to assist the German forces on land with gunfire. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Stockholm - According to reliable sources, there are currently 2,500 German troops surrounded in Norway, including 1,000 in Narvik and 1,500 in the surrounding area. It is too early to say whether these troops have already surrendered. In short, regarding this matter, neither British nor Norwegian military authorities have made any announcements. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>London - The War Office recently issued a war report on the situation in Norway, stating that a large contingent of German reinforcements landed in Trondheim Bay yesterday and has begun a counter-offensive. After fierce fighting, our forces were able to reverse the situation. There is no news to report regarding the situation in other areas. Observers commented that the German counter-offensive aims to reduce the pressure on German forces in Trondheim, but the landing of these reinforcements is not enough to prevent the Allies from advancing south. According to some sources, German reinforcements landed under the cover of destroyer fire. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Stockholm - News received here last night states that Steinkjer is now in the hands of German troops, but Allied forces are holding a strong position six miles north of the city, which the Germans are expected to attack. German aircraft and destroyers in Trondheim Bay are assisting in operations around Steinkjer. The railway stations north of the city have been repeatedly attacked from the air, but the bridges and tracks are undamaged because they are located between cliffs and are difficult for German pilots to hit. The residents of Steinkjer have fled into the mountains, suffering from hunger and cold. Støren, an important railway junction south of Trondheim, is now controlled by Allied forces, and the two railways from Trondheim to Oslo and from Vagnas to Oslo are also in the hands of the Allied forces. German aircraft have repeatedly bombed Åndalsnes and Dombås. It is reported that Dombås is currently on fire. Troops were seen parachuting into the southeast of the city. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Stockholm - Allied forces continue to land at Fosnes and Åndalsnes, so the strength of Allied forces in the Trondheim area is increasing daily. German air activity continues unabated, but German aircraft have suffered many losses. Some have been shot down by increasingly effective British anti-aircraft guns, while others have been forced to land due to bad weather. It is reported that Allied forces now control the railway south of Trondheim to Lillehammer. If this is true, it is strategically important because it has cut off the German route for reinforcements to Trondheim. Although German forces in Trondheim can hold out for the time being, they will be in a desperate situation if they rely solely on aerial assistance from the south. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Stockholm - According to recent reports here, German forces concentrated north of Oslo have reached the vicinity of Koppang, 50 miles north of Elverum. Allied forces are sending troops to the area to prevent the German advance. According to a telegram from the Aftonbladet correspondent in the village of Kjølen, northeast of Oslo, Norwegian troops are currently holding a mountain ridge near the Swedish border. The Germans initially thought that the Norwegian troops would not put up much resistance, but a Norwegian volunteer officer encouraged his subordinates to fight hard, causing the Germans to encounter unexpected resistance. Yesterday, 200 German troops were killed in the area. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>British and French Still Maintain Initiative</p>
<p>Paris - Regarding the war situation in Norway, responsible figures here recently stated that the war in Northern Europe is becoming increasingly important and more intense. In terms of naval warfare, Britain and France still maintain the initiative. The German fleet is blockaded in various bays and can only conduct minor operations, no longer daring to sail on the high seas. In terms of land warfare, the German army is limited in number on all fronts, and only advanced units can conduct attacks. This can be seen in the fighting that occurred around Steinkjer (north of Trondheim) on the 23rd of this month. Germany is currently making maximum use of air power to assist land operations, bombing land transport routes and Allied landing ports in the North Sea and along the Norwegian coast, and strafing Allied forces with machine guns. Allied anti-aircraft batteries are also firing at them at all times. In addition, Norway's mountainous terrain and dense forests make it easy for Allied troops to camouflage themselves or take refuge in the mountains, so German air raids are difficult to succeed. Moreover, the weather is bad at the front, and German aircraft often get lost in the fog and snow. The frontline war can generally be divided into three areas: (1) The German forces in the north at Narvik have been surrounded on three sides by Allied forces. (2) In the central region around Trondheim, both sides are still engaged in fierce fighting, and the Allied forces have continued to make progress. Although the Germans attempted to force a crossing at Namsos, the Allied's initial landing point, with small warships, they were unsuccessful. Two battalions of German reinforcements have landed in Trondheim and have advanced to the front to reinforce and launch a counter-offensive. After fierce fighting by the Allied forces, the situation has been reversed. According to unconfirmed reports, the Allied forces south of Trondheim have advanced to within 60 kilometers of the port. (3) The war situation in the southern region seems extremely chaotic, especially around Lillehammer. However, it is reported that the German forces have stopped advancing north and have instead turned northwest, planning to strike directly at the Swedish border with maximum effort. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>Steinkjer a Scorched Earth</p>
<p>London - According to a telegram from a Swedish newspaper correspondent, the fierce battle between German and Allied forces in the Steinkjer area has now stopped. The city has been completely destroyed, and the homes of 6,000 residents are in ruins. A Norwegian staff officer told the correspondent that the German forces have made only slight progress in the area and do not pose an immediate threat to the Allied forces. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>German Losses Reach 17,000</p>
<p>Paris - Today, "Le Petit Parisien" declared that the German side has lost 17,000 men in the war in Norway, of which 14,000 drowned en route to Norway. The newspaper also stated that 61,000 tons of German transport ships have been sunk and 36,000 tons have been damaged. The above losses of German lives do not include the crew members on the transport ships. The newspaper also stated that the German side has lost nine transport planes. (Taiwan Electricity, 25th)</p>
<p>German War Report Claims Continued Progress</p>
<p>Berlin - The German war report stated that the British Navy has once again made every effort to bombard military strongholds 30 kilometers northeast of Narvik. The resistance of the enemy forces encountered by the German troops north of Trondheim is weak, so they have occupied several mountain passes. German troops have now completely occupied all parts of Trondheim and the railway leading to the Swedish border. In the Oslo area, German troops continue to advance fiercely to the north and northeast. The army, with the aid and cooperation of the air force, is destroying enemy positions. In the Skagerrak Strait, two enemy submarines were sunk. A small unit of German warships spotted several French destroyers not far from the mouth of the Skagerrak Strait and immediately opened fire. After a brief engagement, the French destroyers quickly fled westward. On the 23rd, two new Norwegian destroyers were placed under the control of German crews. Yesterday, German aircraft reconnoitered the central and northern parts of the North Sea, reaching as far as the Shetland Islands, and damaged enemy transport routes to Lillehammer, Trondheim, and Bergen. German aircraft sometimes flew low to strafe enemy troops traveling on the roads and enemy gathering points. German fighter planes bombed the enemy's navy and shot down four enemy planes, three of which crashed in the North Sea and one near Aalborg. Two German aircraft did not return to base. There were no special or important battles on the Western Front. Two French aircraft were shot down over the border by German anti-aircraft guns. Two German aircraft flying into enemy territory went missing. (Haitong, 25th)</p>
<p>British, French, and Norwegian Forces Cooperate Fully</p>
<p>Stockholm - The Norwegian News Agency recently issued news from Narvik stating that the Norwegian Army's Sixth Division has completed its mobilization in the north, has high morale, and is fully cooperating with the British and French Allied forces. As for Torøya Island and Sørreisa, civil administrations have been organized. The people everywhere are optimistic about the future of the war. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>British Troops Going to Norway Called "Northwest Expeditionary Force;" General Vyvyan Pope Named Commander-in-Chief</h3>
<p>London - "The War Office declared that the official name of the British expeditionary force in Norway is now designated as the Northwest Expeditionary Force." (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>The Hague - "De Telegraaf" reported that Britain has now appointed Major General Vyvyan Pope as Commander-in-Chief of the British Norwegian Expeditionary Force. Major General Pope was born in Brussels in 1880. He served in the British Army and has earned distinguished military merits. He participated in the South African War, and was wounded twice. At the beginning of the First World War in 1914, he served in the British forces in Somaliland, and was wounded in battle. In 1915, he was ordered to go to the Western Front to fight, and was wounded eight times, with a broken left arm and blindness in one eye. In 1916, the superiors awarded him the Victoria Cross for his bravery in combat. At the beginning of the current European war, Major General Pope happened to be in Warsaw, as a member of the British military delegation. After the collapse of the Polish army, he took refuge in Romania. (Haitong, 25th)</p>

<h3>Germany and Romania Sign Annex to Commercial Agreement, Adjusting Trade Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>Bucharest - The German economic delegation, led by Mr. Clodius, Director of the Economic Department of the German Foreign Ministry, arrived here on the 18th of this month and has been in talks with the Romanian State Council for several days. The two sides signed a protocol this afternoon as an annex to the current commercial agreement between the two countries (which was established on December 21st of last year). The main contents are as follows: (1) The exchange rate between the Mark and the Romanian Leu will remain as originally agreed, maintained at 41 Lei per Mark. The price of Romanian grain exported to Germany will be calculated based on this exchange rate.

<h3>United States Expands Scope of Moral Embargo, Limits Sale of Warplane Goods to Aggressor Nations, Japan Formally Protests, U.S. Unyielding</h3>
<p>Washington - According to reliable sources here today, Japan has lodged a formal protest with the U.S. government because the United States recently expanded the moral embargo to include various goods essential for air warfare. This protest has elicited a brief and unyielding response from the U.S. State Department, which stated that it reserves all rights regarding internal regulations concerning the implementation of the moral embargo. Although the Japanese Embassy in the United States and the State Department exchanged important notes several weeks ago, this matter has never been officially announced. Officials at the State Department remain silent about Japan's protest. The significance of this protest and reply, in the opinion of authorities here, is two-fold: one is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the moral embargo in hindering Japan's military operations in China, and the other is to express the firm resolve of the United States' policy of restricting the sale of goods to aggressor nations that engage in wanton bombing of civilians from the sky. It is reported that the Japanese government opposes the extension of the moral embargo to machinery used to manufacture and refine gasoline for aircraft, which is the third and most recent expansion of the embargo by the United States.

<h3>British Authorities Study Aerial Blockade</h3>
<p>London - According to reliable sources, British authorities are studying the feasibility of an aerial blockade of German imports and exports.

However, this is more difficult and is a realistic situation. (25th Havas News Agency)</p>

<h3>North and South America Constructing the World's Longest Highway, Stretching 14,000 Miles</h3>
<p>The world's greatest highway, starting from Prudhoe Bay in Alaska, in the northwest corner of North America, and ending in the capital of Argentina, in the southeast corner of South America, passes through various climates, including frigid, temperate, and tropical zones, stretching 14,000 miles. Some sections have already been built. The Inter-American organizations are stepping up efforts to hold a traffic opening ceremony on Columbus Day in 1942. At that time, this highway, in addition to connecting Alaska and the Panama Canal Zone, will directly connect 16 North and South American countries, passing through every republic on the Western Hemisphere continent. Although Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay will not be passed through, branch roads will be connected.</p>
<p>The construction of this highway is proceeding in several major sections. In the north, from Prudhoe Bay to Seattle, a length of 2,250 miles, is being supervised by the Alaska International Highway Commission. Its route is yet to be surveyed. It may be connected to the existing highway that passes through the western plateau of Canada and goes north to Hyder (60 miles east of the southern border of Alaska). The U.S. State Department has recently begun negotiations with Canadian authorities to complete this highway.</p>
<p>From Seattle, there is already a new highway that goes south through the United States to Nogales, on the Mexican border. Mexico plans to build a section from here that passes through Guadalajara, winding up to Mexico City, which is 7,392 feet above sea level. This section of the highway will also connect with the Inter-American Highway that starts from Laredo, Texas, in the United States, and goes southwest through Mexico City to the end point of Panama.</p>
<p>This section of the highway is planned to be built to 40 miles south of the capital. After that, the Inter-American Highway will continue for more than 110 miles, followed by dirt roads and narrow paths in the forest. Then it leads to the Talisman Bridge on the Suchiate River on the Guatemalan border. The section of highway within Guatemala is 312 miles long, winding up the mountain, passing through the capital of the country, and also passing over the bridge on the Tamazula River. This section of the highway has now been partially renovated, and only a portion of the year can be used for cars. Some sections have steep and difficult slopes.</p>
<p>The next country passed through is El Salvador. From a place between Contralía and Santa Ana, to a place between the capital of the country and San Vicente, there is already a 50-mile long highway. From this section to San Miguel in eastern El Salvador, there is also a partially renovated highway, which can only be used for traffic for a portion of the year. It is expected that El Salvador will build the final eight miles of the highway within its borders this year.</p>
<p>After the car arrives in San Miguel, it must be transported by ship to Panama, because although Honduras is planning to build a 90-mile long section of the highway within its borders, construction has not yet started. The same is true for the approximately 265 miles of highway within Nicaragua. Of the 260 miles of highway planned to be built within Costa Rica, only 75 miles are currently under construction. The land within the country is rugged, making the completion of the highway even more difficult.</p>
<p>In Panama, the first section of the highway, about 65 miles long, that leads to David, has not yet been built. From David, however, there is a road with a rough surface, 50 miles long, followed by 235 miles of asphalt road. After that, there is a 12-mile long cement road, to the western end of the Panama Canal Zone. In addition, the United States and Panama will jointly plan to build 70 miles, from La Chorrera to the Rio Hato military airfield. It is expected that the Panamanian authorities will allocate 4-5 million to 1 million US dollars this year to build the highway, most of which will be used to build the Inter-American Highway.</p>
<p>The Inter-American Highway ends within the borders of Panama, and the Pan-American Highway goes south. These two highways cannot be connected, because it is currently extremely difficult to build roads in the wilderness forests of southern Panama and northern Colombia. According to the current plan, after the car arrives in Panama, it must be transported by ship to Cartagena in Colombia, or to La Guaira in Venezuela, where there are national highways available. To Bogota, Colombia, there is also a dry highway to the port of Guayaquil, Ecuador. There is no land route to Peru here, but cars can be transported by ship to Machala in southern Ecuador, and follow the dry coastal highway to the capital of Peru.</p>
<p>From the capital of Peru, there are two highways that can lead directly to the capital of Argentina. One is the coastal highway, which has already been built and can be used for traffic all year round. After arriving in Valparaiso, Chile, there is a highway going east, through the Andes Mountains to the capital of Argentina. The other, which will be the main line of the Pan-American Highway, is being built from the capital of Peru, going southeast, passing through Cusco in Peru, the capital of Bolivia (the highest capital in the world, 13,000 feet above sea level), and the three places of Jujuy, Tucumán, and Córdoba in Argentina, and then to the capital of Argentina. Some sections of this highway can already be used for traffic.</p>
<p>Before the construction of the highway from Mexico to Panama started, the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads estimated that the construction cost would be 160 million US dollars. According to the Pan-American Highway Finance Committee, it would only cost 78 million US dollars to complete. Among them, Mexico is responsible for more than 22 million US dollars, and Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Panama each contribute around 12 million US dollars. The rest is borne separately by other countries. The United States has already spent 1,125,000 US dollars on surveying, bridge building, and other projects.</p>
<p>The construction of the highway is underway, and public concern is also growing. The American automotive class is eagerly awaiting the opening of this highway. The Central American countries estimate that after the completion of the highway, the annual income from accommodating tourists will increase by 500,000 US dollars.

<h3>Japanese Troops in Chaozhou and Shantou Attempt to Break Through Han River Blockade Line, Repeatedly Dispatch Aircraft for Reconnaissance and Bombing, Battles on Various Lines Intermittent</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Heavy rains in the Fujian-Jiangxi border area for several days, the Han River has risen, on the Xiangzi Bridge, there is a Japanese shallow-water warship, more than ten armed electric boats, attempting to attack Dabu and Meixian upstream. Since the 10th, Japanese warships off the coast of Shantou have increased greatly, with three Japanese shallow-water warships in the Chaoyang and Da'hao area of the Xinjin port, two Japanese warships in the north and south ports of Chenghai, three Japanese warships in Long'ao on Nan'ao Island, and seven or eight large and small Japanese warships between Hongluoqian and Mayukou. There are two Japanese warships in the port of Shantou, and a Japanese aircraft carrier is stationed between Nan'ao and Chenghai. Every morning, five aircraft are dispatched to fly into Chaozhou and Shantou to assist in the battle.</p>
<p>The Lingdong Chinese army, currently commanded by Miao Mou-nan, has laid mobile water mines and obstacles in the Rongjiang and Lianjiang rivers between Jieyang and Chaoyang, downstream between Guanbu, Guiyu, and Caoyu. The navigation of ships downstream of the Han River is only possible to Fu-huang. Between Fu-huang and Hulushi Zhixi, there is a警戒line. Below Zhixi to Yixi in Chao'an is a mobile water mine area, and land and water transportation is cut off. The Japanese warships on the Xiangzi Bridge surface sailed above Caijiawei last month, but were repelled by the Chinese army. In early this month, the Japanese army was defeated again in Yuyao and other places on the Anjie Road, so they changed their direction to invade the border between Fengshun and Jieyang, and attacked Po-jie Ridge with cavalry artillery, but were also defeated by the Chinese military and civilians. On the 9th, the defeated Japanese army returned to Chaozhou City. On the morning of the 10th, three Japanese aircraft flew to bomb Hulushi, Chang'anli, Da-shi Street, and Minxing Teahouse, dropping more than twenty bombs. Residents were awakened from their dreams, flesh and blood flew everywhere, fires broke out everywhere, and fifty to sixty innocent men and women were killed or injured, creating an unprecedented tragedy. On the 11th, the Japanese artillery on Wenli Mountain and Jianfeng Mountain opened fire on the Chinese army's Fenghuang Mountain and Ge Mountain in Zhongrong District, bombarding them all day long. More than thirty civilian houses near Ge Mountain were destroyed. Also that morning, five Japanese aircraft flew in from the sea and wreaked havoc over Jieyang, Fengshun, and Raoping. At noon, two more aircraft swept over Nie, about three hundred feet from the water surface, flying low along the river, dropping twelve bombs in a row at Zhixikou, northwest of Hulushi, and also opening machine guns to strafe Jiuhuazhai Village, attempting to break the Chinese army's blockade. However, the Chinese army's blockade line was cleverly deployed and was not detected by the Japanese aircraft. On the 13th, two more Japanese aircraft flew low along the river, opening fire and shooting indiscriminately whenever they were at a river bend. Currently, the Chinese army is still firmly guarding Po-jie Ridge, Gouxia Village, Shaxitou, and other places. There is no trace of the Japanese in Yixi and Zhuxiang. As for the Japanese army that invaded Jieyang Yujiao from Xiangniujima, Qingma Mountain, and Bailian Lake, they fought fiercely with the Chinese army on the 14th between Guishan and Xigang. About six to seven hundred Japanese cavalry artillery were intercepted by the Chinese army in the southern section of the Anjie Road, and the fierce battle lasted for four hours. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties and retreated in embarrassment to Fuyang. The Chinese army in Chenghai heard that the Japanese army on the Anjie Road had been defeated. On the morning of the 14th, before dawn, they divided their troops into two groups and attacked Liaohai City from Ouding and Zhanglin, fighting with the Japanese army outside the South Gate at Huangpoao and Qingshegang. Three Japanese aircraft flew out from the sea to assist, dropping bombs towards the Chinese army's positions. The Chinese army was forced to retreat and instead sent guerrillas to rush into the city, destroying three Japanese puppet organs and killing more than two hundred Japanese and puppet soldiers before retreating.</p>
<h3>The Devastating Robbery of the Fang Family Outside the East Gate of Qingpu, Residents Searched and Robbed for Three Days, More Than Twenty Civilians Killed</h3>
<p>Qingpu Correspondence: At Fangjia Yao outside the East Gate of Qingpu, on the 20th, 21st and 22nd of this month, dozens of "Peacekeeping Army" men, led by Japanese people, suddenly came. All of them were in plain clothes and carried out a large-scale search, looting all the male cotton-padded clothes. During the search, more than twenty civilians were shot or stabbed to death by bayonets because they ran away in fear. Later, four trucks of Japanese troops, about a hundred people, came and lined up to search in Fangjia Yao, north of Xiaodongwei. They severely tortured the resident Wu Ping (62 years old), forcing him to hand over the guerrilla captain. Because they could not get the information, they tied Pan to Songjiang. The previously bound and escorted guerrilla captain Wang was also escorted to Songjiang. Also, the Japanese army forced Fangjia Yao to establish a "Maintenance Society." Because no one responded, they threatened to carry out a large-scale massacre.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Suzhou Forcibly Conscripts Laborers to Build Roads, Intending to Defend Against the Chinese Army</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: The Japanese army stationed in Suzhou, because Chinese mobile units are frequently found in the northeast countryside, and the Su-Chang Highway is often sabotaged, and land transportation is repeatedly blocked. Therefore, on the 10th of this month, the puppet county government was instructed to convene a meeting of puppet township chiefs from Nanbeiqiao, Lumu, Huangdai, Dongqiao, Huguan, Mudu, and other townships. The Japanese side submitted a proposal to conscript 500 villagers from each township to build the highways designated by the Japanese army in sections: (1) Mudu to Tianping Mountain, (2) Wei-jing Tang to Taiping Bridge, (3) Wu-ta to Xiangcheng, (4) Jinshu to Guangfu, (5) Fengqiao to Huguan Wuqian. It is said that construction is scheduled to start on the 13th of this month and is scheduled to be completed before the end of this month in order to prevent the active activities of the Chinese mobile units.</p>

<h3>Finance: Spot and Futures Exchange Rates Gradually Converging</h3>
<p>In yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged across the board. The spot exchange rate for British pounds in the black market remained stagnant, while the exchange rate for US dollars initially tightened and then retreated. Futures exchange rates rose across the board, and swap rates gradually converged, indicating that Chinese speculators were bullish on futures. Hong Kong Electric sold May futures, with the price rising to the four-pence mark. The bank's buying and selling price for spot US dollars was 6.0625 yuan. Futures exchange rates were particularly volatile, stabilizing only at noon. Spot British pounds were level and US dollars tightened. Distant-month rates tended to ease across the board. Spot and current-month futures prices had both converged.</p>
<p>Speculators Continuously Selling</p>
<p>In the early morning, with London large bars rising by 0.0625, distant-month rates were flat. New York silver prices remained level, and London raw gold remained stagnant. Foreign exchange rates for British pounds against US dollars, Shanghai currency, and French francs were all level. The exchange rate for US dollars against British pounds fell by one and a half points, against Shanghai currency fell by seven points, and against French francs fell by one point. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened with spot selling prices in the morning, with British gold quoted at 125 pence and US dollars at 6 yuan. Compared to the previous day, British pounds were level and US dollars were soft by 0.0625 yuan, due to the decline in foreign exchange rates. At the same time, futures exchange rates opened, with US dollars slightly tighter across the board and British gold unchanged. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The increased balance tax on silver was announced at 50 cents. After that, speculators began to sell aggressively, gradually hardening. It is estimated that speculators sold May US dollars to outsiders at 5.75 yuan and April US dollars at 6.03125 to 0625 yuan. Soon, the selling pressure intensified, and Hong Kong Electric also sold off. With speculators continuously selling, although outsiders had a good appetite, it was difficult to balance supply and demand, resulting in May British gold trading at four pence and May US dollars being accepted by outsiders at a low of 5.78125 and 8125 yuan. Outsiders also traded April US dollars at 6.025 yuan. By noon closing, the market had stabilized slightly. Spot British gold remained at 125 pence, US dollars at 6.0625 yuan, April British gold at 125 pence, US dollars at 6.03125 yuan, May British gold at 3.984375 pence, and US dollars at 5.78125 yuan.</p>
<p>British and American Futures Both Rose</p>
<p>There were no major changes in the afternoon. Speculators sold April US dollars to outsiders at 6.03125 yuan, but outsiders were unable to sell at the same price, so distant-month rates were relatively stable. Until the close, British gold remained at 125 pence, US dollars at 6.03125 yuan, April British and American pounds were also at 125 pence and 6.03125 yuan, and May British gold at 3.984375 pence and US dollars at 5.78125 yuan. As a result, compared to yesterday afternoon's close, spot British pounds were level and US dollars tightened by 0.03125 yuan, April British pounds hardened by 0.015625 yuan, and US dollars were level. May British pounds softened by 0.046875 yuan, and US dollars also hardened by 0.03125 yuan.</p>

Spot British pounds continued to soften by 0.03125 yuan, spot US dollars rebounded by 0.03125 yuan, and Shanghai currency rose slightly by 25 cents. The black market price of "Joint Currency" was high by 10 cents, at 103.15 yuan. (Note: The black market price of "Joint Currency" may be a coding error, and it remains to be verified whether it is still at the original price.)</p>
<h3>Gold Market Highly Volatile, Fluctuating by Hundreds of Yuan Throughout the Day, Resulting in a Net Decrease of Only Six Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's black market for cash gold was highly volatile, with the highest and lowest prices differing by as much as 100 yuan. The situation was very tense. This was due to the resurgence of rumors about the European situation, which led to a buying spree in the market. As a result, the net decrease was minimal. In the early morning, with foreign exchange rates declining and US dollars tightening, the market opened at 5,690 yuan, up 25 yuan from the previous close. Subsequently, as securities firms and money changers unloaded, the price quickly fell to 5,625 yuan. However, gold dealers aggressively bought at the low price, raising it by 30 yuan. Unexpectedly, securities firms and money changers continued to unload relentlessly, and the trend was unstoppable. At that time, the US dollar turned longer, breaking through the 5,600 yuan mark and reaching a low of 5,590 yuan. Thanks to silver houses slightly pulling up at noon, the loose momentum of the US dollar slightly reversed, and it began to stabilize, leaving the 5,600 yuan level. After the market improved, silver houses helped to float more and re-entered, rising from 5,615 yuan to 40 yuan. At around 3 pm, due to rumors about the European situation, securities firms entered the market and searched aggressively, rising to 5,675 yuan. However, as a result, the company suddenly took some profit, and the closing price was 5,659 yuan, down slightly by 6 yuan from the previous day. The total transaction volume was more than 2,000 taels. The price of gold ornaments in silver shops fluctuated, resulting in a flat result. The price of customs gold remained stagnant.</p>
<p>Cash Gold Once Reached the 600 Yuan Mark</p>
<p>From the beginning of each bar (ten taels), the foreign exchange rate initially declined, and the US dollar slightly tightened. A money changer first came to buy, entering 20 taels for the securities firm at 5,690 yuan, up 25 yuan from the previous close. Subsequently, as securities firms and gold dealers took advantage of the high prices to sell, buyers watched the trend from the sidelines, and the price fell slightly by 20 yuan in an instant. Later, with money changers also following suit, and at that time the foreign exchange market turned loose, there were even fewer traders, and the price fell by another 45 yuan. Gold dealers bought ten taels from silver houses, inferior to 5,625 yuan. However, gold dealers and retail investors entered at that time, gradually rising by 30 yuan. Gold dealers bought 30 taels from silver houses at 5,655 yuan. Unexpectedly, securities firms saw the opportunity to sell again at that time, and the price fell by more than 40 yuan again. Later, with the US dollar continuing to harden and the selling pressure increasing, it broke through the 5,600 yuan mark. Gold dealers bought 50 taels from silver houses at 5,590 yuan. Near the close, silver houses turned from selling to buying, and gradually stabilized. Soon, it returned to the 5,600 yuan level. Money changers bought ten taels from Yu, at 5,618 yuan. Then, silver houses did each other ten taels, at 5,615 yuan, as the noon closing price. The market opened 5 yuan higher in the afternoon, and money changers made each other 20 taels at 5,620 yuan. Then the money changers spat out some, and it fell back 5 yuan. Money changers sold 20 taels to silver houses at 5,615 yuan. Subsequently, gold dealers and silver houses helped to pull in more, and rose step by step. By about 3:00 PM, the price rose to 5,640 yuan. Unexpectedly, securities firms suddenly came and absorbed aggressively at that time, the market atmosphere was tense, and it rose by 35 yuan. Securities firms bought 50 taels from silver houses at 5,675 yuan. After entering, the securities firms suddenly came and released again, and the market situation changed immediately. Money changers made each other 20 taels, retreating to 5,655 yuan. At 3:30 PM, gold dealers did each other ten taels, at 5,659 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it decreased by 6 yuan compared to the previous day, fluctuating by 100 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash gold by the gold dealers was a few yuan higher than the cash gold, and the purchasing price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current bid gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little trading.</p>
<p>The Price of Gold Ornaments in Silver Shops Was Uncertain</p>
<p>The initial selling price of gold jewelry per tael in silver shops was still 570 yuan in Datongxing. At 9:25 am, it hung up to 5 yuan, but it fell back 5 yuan in less than half an hour. It fell back by 5 yuan at 11:00 am, and rebounded by 5 yuan in the afternoon at 1:30 pm. As a result, it was flat, and Datongxing still hung at 570 yuan. Xintongxing's price was the same as the above price, and the purchasing price was reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dollar Bills Break the One-Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of British and American gold pounds continued to fall due to the smooth supply from all parties. Later, it returned to level due to the rebound in the price of gold. The supply and demand of British gold bills was still even, and the market price stabilized. The price of American dollar bills initially rose to 16.42 yuan due to the continued drop in the price of the pound. Subsequently, the supply from all parties suddenly became abundant, and it once retreated to 16.31 yuan. In the afternoon, it was suddenly rumored that the European war would expand further, and the evening market rose to 16.37 yuan, up 2 cents from the previous day. Hong Kong dollar bills did not fall due to the decline in Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rates. The supply of French franc bills was still strong, and the market price continued to trend down. There was some demand for Dutch and Ruble bills, and the market price rose slightly. There was a sudden supply of Philippine bills, and the market price softened slightly. The supply of Japanese gold bills and Korean bills was again abundant, and the declining trend restarted. The former retreated to 1.265 yuan, and the latter was cheaper than legal tender, falling to 99 cents in the evening market.</p>
<h3>Cash Eases, Discount Rate Returns to Around 100 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for foreign exchange drafts initially rose and then fell. It initially rose to 112.5 yuan per thousand yuan, and then rose to nearly 114 yuan near noon. In the afternoon, cash suddenly flooded the market, and it fell sharply to around 100 yuan, which was 10 yuan lower than the previous day. The interest rate for interbank lending by the Money Industry Association remained unchanged at 20 cents in the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3>Securities Speculation in Foreign Stocks: Wheelock and Shanghai Kelantan Rubber Estates</h3>
<p>Yesterday's stock market dark trading saw a rebound due to short covering, mostly driven by retail investors. The Japanese yen continued to be sold off, with afternoon gains stronger than those in the morning. Buyers were mostly floating investors. Yesterday's trading was mostly swapping, with Jardine Matheson, Tung Woh Hong, and Dah Lien Yee swapping shares, entering and exiting frequently. Ewo, Tai Fung, Kiu Foong, Teh Fu, Lien Ho all engaged in short covering, while Sietas and Wing On Kang concluded long positions. Tung Kang, Hong Kang, and Yan Chong sought profit through selling. Heng Yuan Tung Shun and No. 38 saw cash stock outflow. Overall, the market price, although rebounding, lacked a firm foundation. The overall result for the day was a rebound of 4.5 to 5.5 dimes. Total transaction volume was approximately 600,000 yuan. A concise summary is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 30 shares of Wusih Ching Fong Spinning Mill were traded at a price of 62 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's stock market trading experienced another extremely tense day. The market opened stable but gradually weakened, eventually leading to a significant downturn. Sellers disregarded prices, competing to find buyers.</p>
<p>Regarding Wheelock, baseless rumors proliferated, claiming that the company's ships would be requisitioned by the British government. Consequently, the stock suffered severe damage, dropping as low as 194 yuan under heavy selling pressure. Later, buyers stepped in to maintain the price, with the closing price at 199 yuan for buying and 201 yuan for selling.</p>
<p>Stocks of various holding companies, such as International, Yangtze, and Shanghai, also suffered price declines due to the sharp fall of Wheelock. They once fell sharply but eventually rebounded to closing prices of 31.5 yuan, 20 yuan, and 34.25 yuan, respectively.</p>
<p>Shanghai Kelantan Rubber Estates, on the contrary, was very active and strong. Its ability to withstand profit-taking and short selling was remarkable, with 105,000 shares traded. At the closing price of 31.25 yuan, there was excellent demand, with sellers asking for 31.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Rubber stocks were also affected by the severe decline in industrial stocks and became sluggish, but there were no dramatic price changes.</p>
<p>Today, due to the fall in Wheelock's stock price, this newspaper received a letter from someone named "Li Liangzhen," lobbying for Wheelock's long position. The reason he gave was that "Wheelock's ships are mostly slow and far in the East, and they cannot meet the needs of European military transportation. Even the larger shipping companies such as Jardine Matheson and Swire have not been requisitioned, so it is unlikely that Wheelock's barges will be requisitioned." Regarding whether Britain will requisition Far East merchant ships, rumors have been circulating in this city for a long time. Yesterday, the old story was brought up again. There should be factual evidence. Empty words only confuse people. There are currently six or seven types of manipulated foreign stocks. Any stock with huge gains and losses is clear evidence of speculation. Flipping long and short positions is a very common tactic. Flying moths into the fire can be a warning.</p>
<h3>Food: Foreign Rice Continues to Fall; Saigon Rice Shipped Directly to Tianjin</h3>
<p>The momentum of the sharp fall in foreign rice has not stopped. Both buyers and sellers are wary of the drastic changes in the rice market, fearing significant losses, and dare not act rashly. Sellers, if they are original wholesale merchants, continue to seek quick sales, while floating speculators, who rely on speculation, are even less interested. They are selling their goods at low prices. Although buyers want to increase their purchases, they are not willing to move suddenly. Customers in inland rural areas are also just watching. The overall situation still shows a pattern of only selling and not buying. Therefore, the asking price has been lowered step by step, and all grades have consistently continued to fall. Small-grain rice is selling the fastest, and there are relatively more chips on the market. The price once fell to 40 yuan. Then, floating short positions took advantage of the low price to absorb, and new囤 (tun, i.e. those holding back on sales) also made inquiries. The market gradually rose, and in the afternoon, it rose to 40 yuan and 9 dimes. Other Saigon, Siam, and Huo Jiao rice initially fell and then rose. The results were all similar to the closing prices of the previous day. However, No. 2 Saigon, which had been taken back into stock, opened at a low of 52 yuan in the morning and was then absorbed by customers. The closing price was 52.5 yuan, a rise of half a yuan. Total transactions for the day were 200 tons of futures and 6,000 bags of spot.</p>
<p>Jing Hu (a kind of rice) domestic rice, another seven or eight cars of Changchow and Wusih goods and 1,300 or 1,400 bags of Qing Si and Nan Gang goods arrived. Sales were quite active due to the lower prices. The selling prices were similar to those of the past, without much gain or loss.</p>
<p>Food in North China has also been subjected to a terrifying scenario by certain parties. Therefore, a large amount of foreign rice has been purchased recently. In addition to those shipped from this city, they are also directly ordering from Vietnam and Siam. Previously, the Norwegian merchant ship Mimei, loaded with more than 30,000 bags of foreign rice in Saigon and destined for Tianjin, was detained in Hong Kong because Norway was affected by the European war. The ship stayed in Hong Kong for many days. The Norwegian ship has now resumed its voyage, and it set sail from Hong Kong for Tianjin on the 24th. Jardine Matheson's Ewo Sheng ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, reportedly carrying 11,331 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, which will be shipped to Tianjin within days.</p>
<h3>Flour Trading is Very Quiet; Wheat Still Tends to Be Rejected</h3>
<p>Flour trading remains quiet. The price for No. 2 Flour Mill is 13 yuan and 8 dimes. Less than 5,000 bags were sold in small batches on this street. The price for old brands taken back into stock is 13 yuan and 7.5 dimes, without much gain or loss. In the case of miscellaneous brands of flour from inland areas, a new batch has just arrived. Transportation costs will have to be added in the future, increasing the cost. Those holding goods mostly plan to wait for a good price. Therefore, trading has also become quiet. In addition, 2,100 bags of flour and 7,500 bags of wheat bran will be shipped to Fujian today (the 26th).</p>
<p>Buyers and sellers of wheat from factories have frequently been rejecting each other recently. Apart from goods sent to the factory, there have been no large transactions. The total market only opened one car of Changchow and Wusih goods, at a price of 21 yuan. There are currently no proper deals for other middle and lower grades. The market can still stand firm.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Shen Hsin Releases Double Bird Yarn; 2,000 Bales of May-June Yarn</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to decline, with a slight rise in the downwind. This is because actual sales are not strong, and exchange rates are stable, and gold is softening. As a result, some people don't want to be long. However, those with sufficient general economy not only do not want to release the absorbed amount, but also come back to add more when it falls. Therefore, the price of forward contracts is very high.</p>
<p>Spot yarn opened in the morning, continuing the upward trend from the previous day. Although there were many sellers, the factory price of 20-count yarn was 1,428 yuan for 10 bales. However, as soon as the price loosened, buyers flocked in, immediately rising to 1,450 yuan. At this time, the spot price was 1,470 yuan. Then, it was heard that the price of gold was not good, and floating longs closed out. At the same time, the sale of現銷 (a type of yarn) was 牛庸 (a type of yarn). Then, it was seen that it went back down 10 yuan. According to the transaction statistics in half a day, 1,300 bales were traded. The price of 20-count Double Horse spot fell 15 yuan. The Shen Hsin No. 9 factory released 2,000 bales of 20-count Double Horse yarn at a price of 1,470 yuan in full cash. The May-June issue was sold out. Today, 137 pieces were shipped to Qingdao. The amount bought by each帮口 (group) is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Same Industry 1,170; Inland 10</p>
<p>Hong Kong 110; Amoy 10</p>
<p>Total 1,300</p>
<h3>Arrivals of Foreign Cotton Are Becoming Scarce</h3>
<p>Trading in domestic cotton is still not strong. Transactions in Indian and American cotton have increased, but factories are rarely making any moves. All business is done by traders buying and selling to each other. The market is still stable. The current state of spot cotton transactions is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Middling 294.50, Same Industry bought 200 pieces</p>
<p>Ta Chung Chi 245.00, 246.00 also 200 bales</p>
<p>Peng Chia Pu 252.00 also 200 pieces</p>
<p>Fire Damaged Bales 208.00 also 400 bales</p>
<p>North Pacific 218.00 also 300 bales</p>
<p>White Rock 252.00 also 100 bales</p>
<p>Another report: Foreign cotton market prices. The New York cotton market was weak yesterday. Later, due to mass selling and the closing out of some long positions, the closing market price for near-term delivery fell by more than 10 points compared to the previous day. Far-term delivery was firmer, falling by 5 or 6 points. Yesterday, India's (cotton prices) rose by more than one rupee, including forecasts. Egypt's (cotton prices) fell by more than 10 points.</p>
<p>The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai is not active due to the unusually tight credit situation in the market. However, since the outbreak of the European war, the number of ships has been decreasing daily. Therefore, transportation is extremely difficult. The arrival of foreign cotton has been becoming increasingly scarce, and there will be no arrivals from May onwards. The lack of foreign cotton in Shanghai is a reality. According to the current situation, there is a risk of a cotton shortage in mid-June. Although factories have recently ordered several thousand bales, they are all scheduled to be shipped in May and June. However, it is doubtful whether there will be ships arriving on time at that time. Therefore, it is firmly believed that cotton prices will rise sharply in mid-May and June. The factory prices for yesterday's cotton, converted at an exchange rate of 6 yuan per US dollar, are as follows:</p>
<p>20-count American Middling 294.20</p>
<p>Also, Also Lower Grade 285.10</p>
<p>30-count Also 310.50</p>
<p>Also, Also Lower Grade 300.20</p>
<p>40-count Also 314.20</p>
<p>Also, Also Lower Grade 304.90</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Oil Prices Secretly Fall; Soybeans Decline Another Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean market conditions were unfavorable for long positions, and the oil market was stagnant and closed, the underlying trend has already depreciated by more than one yuan. Therefore, all brokers unanimously hesitated to move, and prices fell another yuan. It is estimated that oil pressing factories bought two cars of Pengpu beans, at a price of 23 yuan and 5 dimes, and two cars of Nanjing beans, at a price of 22 yuan. 300 bags of Anqing beans were exported, at a price of 24 yuan. This street bought 200 bags of Wuhu beans, at a price of 20 yuan to 19 yuan and 2 dimes, and 120 bags of Pinghu soybeans, at a price of 25 yuan and 7 dimes to 1 dime. 350 bags of Chongming sand soybeans were sold at prices ranging from 21 yuan to 20 yuan and 5 dimes.</p>
<p>380 bags of soybeans and 7,400 pieces of bean cake and 2,800 bags of fertilizer will be shipped to Fujian today (the 26th).</p>
<p>440 cans of soybean oil and 300 cans of raw oil came from Yantai yesterday.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Refined White Sugar is Scarce and Looks Good</h3>
<p>Yesterday, coarse white sugar became sluggish again, but B-mark refined white sugar rose due to shortage. The trade association's listed prices are: spot 24 coarse white sugar, 63 yuan and 5 dimes per share in this stock, 63 yuan and 2 dimes for new goods in the outside warehouse, 63 yuan and 1 dime for goods arriving on March 18, a small 3 or 4 dimes, 50 yuan for transshipment, a small 5 dimes, Swire refined white sugar, B-mark, 71 yuan and 3 dimes to 5 dimes in the West warehouse, up 5 dimes, DY-mark, 70 yuan and 3 dimes for new goods, 70 yuan for old goods, HX-mark, 70 yuan in the West warehouse, Dutch赤車 (a type of sugar) and 赤 (red sugar) remained unchanged. This factory's snowy white, a small 5 dimes, is 63 yuan. 250 bags of Beihai flake青 (a type of sugar) were offered by the Guangdong幫 (group) for 41.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Market Affected by the European War; Ships to Europe Will Decrease; France Controls Silk Imports</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was no market in Yokohama. In New York, near-term contracts rose by two points, and far-term contracts rose by four and a half points. Silk transactions by foreign firms were not smooth. Zhejiang raw silk was 2,650 yuan, up 50 yuan from the previous market. First-grade was quoted at 2,350 yuan, second-grade was quoted at 2,280 yuan, Zhong Gan was quoted at 2,100 yuan, and Bai Chang肘 (elbow) was priced at 4,900 yuan, but there were no transactions. The European war is increasingly hindering the silk market. For example, the number of mail ships to Europe will decrease after May. This is one reason. France controls foreign trade. French silk importers cannot freely purchase silk and must first apply to the government for a permit. Only after obtaining a permit can they exchange foreign currency and purchase raw silk according to the limited amount. This is another reason. Therefore, the prospect of sales to Europe is often difficult. On the 25th, 101 boxes of rayon were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Coal: Coal Dust Rises by 10 Yuan</h3>
<p>Recently, the various goods of coal dust have been scarce and depleted, and sales have become active. In addition, after the price of lump coal increased, the price of coal dust also followed, rising by 10 yuan. It is estimated that Indian coal dust is 240 yuan per ton, Borneo dust is 230 yuan, Kaiping No. 1 dust is 220 yuan, No. 2 dust is 200 yuan, and Keelung dust is 190 yuan. Customers are charged extra for shipping and handling.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Autumn Floral Velvet Beaverteen; Futures Trading is Booming</h3>
<p>Domestic cloth sales are sluggish. Due to the month-end credit situation, some people who hold goods sell to seek cash, pulling it into the next month. Therefore, near-term prices are low and far-term prices are high. Fine cloth and fine twill are opened up by more than 2 yuan per piece. The spot market was consistently weak yesterday. Fine cloth and twill fell by 5 dimes to 1 yuan, coarse cloth fell by 2.5 dimes to 5 dimes, and bleached and dyed cloth fell by about 5 dimes. Prices are extremely chaotic. Autumn goods printed floral velvet serge gray cloth present bedding and futures trading is booming. Dafen factory black flower middle pattern·Shuilang velvet·Spot is priced at 1 yuan and 1 dime per yard, and more than 200 boxes were sold. Shuilang velvet is the most popular. The June contract for Mingli serge is priced at 1 yuan and 6.5 dimes per yard. Spot is 1 yuan and 5 dimes in the current market. The most active transactions are among warehouse owners in this street. Customers are still rarely acting. In addition, 173 pieces of cotton cloth will be shipped to Fujian today (the 26th).</p>
<p>Eastern cloth fell thousands of times in the morning, and the market trend turned firm. The low price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was sold at 43 yuan and 8 dimes in the morning. Later, due to the strong intentions of peers and warehouse owners on this street, they absorbed it at a low price, and gradually rebounded. At the closing, it rose to 45 yuan and 2.5 dimes. A giant quantity of futures contracts were traded. The next month opened at 47 yuan and 7.5 dimes. Four Gentlemen's serge is currently offered at 1 yuan and 4 dimes and 1 point per yard, and futures are at about 1 yuan and 5 dimes.</p>
<h3>Mercerized Feather Yarn: Short Supply and High Price</h3>
<p>Mercerized feather yarn sales were quite smooth yesterday. The selling price The price of raw silk yarn is high, so the price has risen by 2 dimes. Yesterday, the wholesale price for No. 1 was 2 yuan and 2 dimes per yard, No. 2 was 2 yuan, No. 3 was 1 yuan and 7.5 dimes, and the price for 叫號 (a type of yarn) was 1 yuan and 45 points. Most of them are in demand but not available. As for flat feather yarn, domestic factory goods are not as popular as British goods. The selling price for No. 1 is 10 yuan per yard, and No. 2 is 9 yuan and 2.5 dimes. There is only one type of oblique flower feather yarn manufactured in the UK, and there are no imports or exports. The price is more expensive than flat yarn. However, as the weather is hot, actual sales have gradually decreased. Yesterday, the wholesale price for No. 1 was 10 yuan and 5 points, and No. 2 was 9 yuan and 7.5 points.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Black Dates Recover After a Long Period of Weakness</h3>
<p>Since the price of black dates has been falling, the market price has been cheap. Therefore, customers with high-priced goods are holding and selling less, and the trend is changing. Yesterday, it was heard that 100-odd bags of 統手 (a type of date) black dates were offered at a price of 37 yuan and 5 dimes, an increase of 3 or 4 yuan compared to the previous price.</p>
<h3>Fennel Steps Up</h3>
<p>Fennel is becoming more and more expensive due to the lack of arrivals and stocks. The goods offered by Hao Fang yesterday were of average quality, but the price was still high, reaching 210 yuan, which shows how firm the market is.</p>
<h3>Hardware: New Pan Yuan Spot Goods Are Extremely Scarce</h3>
<p>Recently, the market for new Pan Yuan has been quite strong because there have not been many arrivals and Shanghai stocks are thin. The demand from洋釘 (foreign nail) factories is still healthy. (Because there are no more goods being loaded for shipment overseas), the market price has been rising sharply, and it is 2 or 3 yuan higher than the price of本釘 (domestic nail). The current market price is 65 yuan per担 (picul), while the factory price of yuan钉 (yuan nail) is only 62 or 63 yuan per bucket.</p>
<h3>Hard Lead Wire is Also 2 Yuan Higher</h3>
<p>The trade in white lead wire (also known as hard lead wire) is most active among customers from Tianjin, Qingdao, and Yantai. Local factories also occasionally participate. Recently, people's hearts have become more rigid, so the standard selling price has also increased by 2 yuan. No. 8 to No. 16 is sold for 50 yuan, and No. 16 to No. 20 is sold for 55 yuan.</p>

<h3>Lin Yutang Bets with 米内 (Prime Minister of Japan)</h3>
<p>The upcoming issue of the China Weekly Review contains a letter from Lin Yutang stating that he dares to bet with Japanese Prime Minister 米内 that if Wang Jingwei can now attract three important figures from Chongqing to be at his disposal, he is willing to commit suicide. This is in response to 米内's claim that after the establishment of Wang Jingwei's "government," it can "absorb" many important officials from the National Government to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>New President Ship Name Approved: Circumnavigate Once Every 98 Days; 26 Circumnavigations per Year</h3>
<p>The American President Lines is currently building seven new C-3 type ships to circumnavigate the globe. The names of the ships were approved by the American</p>
<p>Shipping Committee</p>
<p>Yesterday, namely President Adams, President Monroe, President Jackson, President Van Buren, President Polk, President Hayes, and President Garfield. They are now being built at the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company in Newport News, Virginia. President Jackson</p>
<p>The first to be completed</p>

It will circumnavigate the world once every 98 days (including berthing time), which is 14 days less than the circumnavigation date of existing ships. After all seven ships are completed, the American President Lines ships will be able to circumnavigate the globe 26 times a year.</p>
<h3>Orchestra Spends Huge Sums of Money: Western Newspaper Comments: Police and Public Works Need a Lot of Money; Should Add Support to Alleviate Urgency</h3>
<p>The English-language North China Daily News, published yesterday, commented on the Shanghai Municipal Council's budget for 1940, which was approved at the Foreign Taxpayers' Annual Meeting on the 17th. It believes that the orchestra consumes 200,000 yuan of public funds throughout the year, only to please a few music lovers. At the same time, the Municipal Council's Police Department and Public Works Department are closely related to the public, and their funding needs to be increased appropriately. It is incomprehensible why they do not move from one to support the other.</p>
<h3>Norwegian Ships Sail to Shanghai: All Started from Hong Kong: Many Items Loaded</h3>
<p>Norwegian merchant ships have resumed sailing, and the details have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is learned that the Norwegian ships Tiranna, Titania, and Talisman, managed by Tiensheng Foreign Firm, were previously detained in Hong Kong. Talisman set sail from Hong Kong to Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 24th) and is expected to arrive in port this afternoon. The ship came from the United States to Shanghai and is reported to have brought a large amount of cargo, including more than 4,000 pieces of tinplate, 300 boxes of bleaching powder, 2,232 boxes of steel powder, 149 barrels of sulfuric acid, 2,000 large barrels of tobacco leaves, 1,450 bags of洋碱 (foreign alkali) powder, and 100 barrels of Texaco oil. There are 60 cars, totaling 3,999 tons. It will berth at the Hongkou Public &amp; Prosperity Wharf to unload. Titania is scheduled to depart from Hong Kong today and is expected to arrive in Shanghai next Monday (the 29th). Tirauna was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 25th, but the date was delayed due to its detention in Hong Kong. According to Tiensheng Foreign Firm, the shipment canceled the voyage to Shanghai due to shipping schedule reasons and returned to China from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council Visits Consular Leaders</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Keswick, recently formally paid a visit to the consular leader, Nelson. It is learned that Nelson visited the Chairman of the Council yesterday (the 25th) to return the visit. The Chamber of Commerce sent honor guards to pay their respects.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Members Come to China in Succession: Inspect the Occupied Areas: It is Still Unclear What Meaning They Have</h3>
<p>According to foreign sources, the Japanese Cabinet Minister of Health and Welfare, Yoshida Shigeru, Minister of Railways, Matsuno Tsurumoto, and Minister of Colonial Affairs, Koiso Kuniaki, came to China last week to inspect the cities and battle fronts in Japanese-occupied areas such as Beijing, Nanjing, Hankou, and Guangzhou. The arrival of these three cabinet members in China coincided with the so-called "Abe Envoy Group." It is not yet clear whether it is a fixed plan by the Japanese side or a temporary coincidence.</p>
<h3>Western Newspaper Reporters Invited to Nanjing Again: Accompanied by the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that Nanjing will welcome Abe, the Japanese envoy stationed in the "regime," at the end of the week. A group of foreign news reporters from this city, accompanied by the spokespersons of the Japanese Army and the Embassy, will leave the North Station by train at 3:00 PM today (the 25th) and go to Nanjing again to cover the news. The group includes Maurice from the United Press, Ann, Kleinukov, newsreel photographer from Universal Pictures, Keane from the New York Times, Sachs from the Geneva National Daily, Suchi from the German News Agency, Ms. Olsen, Greenworth and his wife, Ul from Le Petit Parisien, and Han Ji from the Reuters Agency.</p>
<p>There will be a new performance in Nanjing today, ostensibly to celebrate the new "regime," but in reality to ingratiate itself with Abe, the Japanese envoy to China. This has a significant impact on the Wang-Japan political relationship. Abe's arrival in China has a major mission. Perhaps it will indicate that Japan is beginning to implement its control plan. Since Abe is the implementer of the instructions of the Japanese military, after his arrival in China, the new "regime" must act in accordance with the new situation in order to please the Japanese military.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Letter Advises Coal Briquette Industry: Consider the Overall Situation: Be Careful Not to Follow the Frenzied Tide: Use Pretexts to Increase Prices Again and Again</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Mechanical Coal Briquette Industry Association yesterday regarding the price of coal briquettes, stating that the price of coal briquettes sold by your association has increased twice in the past half month. Although it is reported that this is due to cost factors, coal briquettes are ultimately needed for fuel by the general public and are closely related to people's livelihood. We urge you to advise your colleagues to maintain their business and consider the overall situation. Be careful not to follow the frenzied tide and tend to the extreme.</p>
<h3>British Federation Labor Strike: To Be Mediated Again: But the Employer Refuses to Negotiate: One Says There is Hope for a Solution</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that some of the agitators of the strike at the British Federation Shipyard at 640 Yangshupu Road were arrested yesterday (the 24th) and are currently in custody. Shortly after their arrest, the strike at the Hefeng Machinery Factory in Pudong, which belongs to the British Federation Shipyard, was announced to have been resolved, and the workers have all returned to work. Although the strike at the British Federation Shipyard is still continuing, there is hope for a quick resolution. The Continental Daily News reported that, according to reliable sources, the British Federation Shipyard has so far refused to negotiate with the workers and may hire White Russians to replace the striking Chinese workers. The workers at the Yangshupu factory of the British Federation Shipyard went on strike on March 14, demanding an increase in wages and rice allowances. Other workers at the factory also responded to the strike last week. The recent strikers are the ship hire workers of the factory. The rumor that the strike will be resolved soon has not been confirmed by responsible people. It is heard that the situation of the strike has not changed, that is, the employer refuses to negotiate with the workers. The rumor that the labor and management sides have reached a compromise in principle is unreliable because there has been no negotiation since the beginning of this month. According to the workers' representatives yesterday, the labor side is still trying to persuade the factory to continue negotiations or will ask a neutral party, such as the Industrial Section of the Municipal Council, to mediate this six-week-old dispute.</p>
<h3>This Port Has Abundant Paper Reserves, Supply Uninterrupted, Price Hikes Due to Manipulation</h3>
<p>Regarding the reasons for paper price hikes, although many excuses are given about scarce supply, a person from the paper industry told a reporter yesterday that such reasons are extremely far-fetched and are merely pretexts used by those who hoard and manipulate prices. This is because the amount of paper reserves in this city is still quite considerable to date. Although the supply from Northern Europe has been obstructed, the imports from the United States are increasing month by month. For example, paper imports from the US to Shanghai totaled 64,782 yuan in February of this year, but surged to 177,879 yuan last month. Currently, ships sailing to Shanghai from the US are all carrying large quantities of paper goods. Therefore, there is absolutely no worry about the supply.</p>
<h3>Fujian Provincial Bank Shanghai Office Underwrites Provincial Bonds, Construction Bonds, 20 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>The Fujian Provincial Government previously submitted a request to the Central Government for permission to issue 20 million yuan in Construction Bonds for the 29th year of the Republic, with an annual interest rate of five percent, paid twice a year. Starting from the fourth year after issuance, principal will be repaid through lottery drawings, with repayment completed over 20 years. Principal and interest are secured by land taxes and provincial enterprises. The bonds are available in denominations of 100 yuan, 1,000 yuan, and 10,000 yuan. Within Fujian Province, they can also be used to pay various local special taxes. These bonds are underwritten by the Fujian Provincial Bank Shanghai Office, located in the French Mail Steamship Company Building on the Bund in this port. It is heard that subscriptions are very enthusiastic. The first batch of 6 million yuan was issued in January and was fully subscribed immediately. The second batch of 6 million yuan is scheduled to be issued on July 1st. The remaining 8 million yuan is scheduled to be issued in the autumn.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West "Special Police Force," No Prospect of Establishment for the Time Being, Currently Drafting Organization and Working Regulations, Economic Issues, Divergent Opinions Between Both Parties</h3>
<p>The issue of the "Special Police Force" in the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Road Area has been delayed for more than two months since the signing of the "Police Agreement" in February, due to the lack of consensus between the Municipal Council and the puppet government. Until recently, the Municipal Council and the puppet government conducted further discussions. It is rumored that negotiations on the "Special Police Force" issue are gradually maturing and will be established next month. According to the Municipal Council official responsible for negotiations with the puppet government,</p>
<p>Chief Inspector Bowen,</p>
<p>claimed that negotiations on the organization of the "Special Police Force" in Shanghai West have made considerable progress recently. However, the rumor that the "Special Police Force" will be established in the middle of next month is unlikely to be realized. As for his negotiations with the puppet "Police Chief" Lu Ying and Japanese Advisor Igarashi Midori, he said that they are expected to conclude next month. It is also learned that both parties are currently</p>
<p>drafting</p>
<p>plans for the organization and work of the "Special Police Force." After the negotiations are concluded, there are still two difficult issues to be resolved: the selection of personnel and economic issues. Regarding the latter issue, the opinions of both parties have not approached each other, and it is particularly difficult to find a solution. It is understood that the focus of the dispute regarding economic issues lies in the</p>
<p>tax issue.</p>
<p>The puppet government is quite covetous of the taxes in the area, while the Municipal Council is determined not to give them up and has already issued a notice from the Municipal Council's Revenue Office that the summer housing tax and various taxes in the area will still be collected by the Municipal Council. The puppet government still insists on demanding and seizing these taxes. Therefore, it is difficult to reach a resolution on the extra-settlement road issue in the short term.</p>

<h3>French Concession, Restricting Arbitrary Rent Increases, Currently Studying and Will Formulate Laws</h3>
<p>French Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Ozé, met with a Western newspaper reporter yesterday and stated that the French Municipal Council is currently investigating the actual situation regarding the issue of landlords arbitrarily increasing rents within the concession, which has led to various adverse consequences, and will formulate a law in the near future</p>
<p>to restrict</p>
<p>it, to reduce the suffering of residents. Mr. Ozé stated that since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, the population of the two concessions has increased sharply, and landlords have taken the opportunity to profit from it, thus causing various disputes. The French Municipal Council is aware of this and is currently seeking solutions. However, although this bad trend has been very obvious for three years,</p>
<p>investigation and exploration</p>
<p>have not been without difficulties, and it has not been possible to determine an appropriate plan to deal with this unreasonable phenomenon. Now, the Municipal Council authorities have stipulated a price control list, and the second step will be to issue some kind of prohibition on rent disputes, in order to seek a way to solve the problem. However, it is still necessary to carefully consider the soaring prices of daily necessities, the increase in taxes and electricity bills, etc., and then formulate a prohibition to prevent landlords from speculating and increasing the burden on tenants.</p>
<p>Tenants Rise Up to Form Associations</p>
<p>Mr. Ozé also stated that ten years ago, French Consul General Fandant prohibited landlords from soliciting tips, and especially prohibited the collection of any improper fees when tenants moved in. However, over time, the prohibition relaxed, and rent disputes have emerged in recent years. Today, due to the depreciation of the currency in this port, the situation is even more serious. Some landlords have even made absurd demands to pay rent in foreign currency. Tenants in the French Concession have unanimously expressed strong resentment against this measure by landlords and have risen up to form tenant associations to show resistance. The Public Concession is very sympathetic to this and there is a trend to organize similar organizations, but the effect is minimal. When rent disputes occur and are brought to court, landlords often win. If this situation continues, order within the concession will be greatly affected and will continue to worsen. Therefore, the French Municipal Council believes that this measure is necessary to implement at present.</p>
<h3>Areas Designated for Prohibition of Transporting Goods Aiding the Enemy, Ministry of Economic Affairs Re-designates</h3>

<h3>Ruithai Steamer Damaged on Entry</h3>
<p>The British Huarlun Trading Company's Jingji Ruithai steamer, carrying passengers and cargo from Ningbo to Shanghai on the 23rd of this month, unexpectedly sustained slight damage when it entered the Wusongkou at about 1:00 AM yesterday. The ship was too close to the shore outside the Wusongkou at about 1:00 AM yesterday, so the driver turned the ship, hoping to steer it further away from the shore. Unexpectedly, the stern accidentally hit the rocks on the shore, causing three holes to rupture in the stern. After being blocked, the ship continued to sail and arrived safely at the Garden Pier on the Bund of Beijing Road at about 2:00 AM.

The ship is scheduled to enter the Ruirong Factory for repairs this morning, which will be completed in about one or two days.</p>
<h3>Maritime Smuggling Rampant, Yesterday Afternoon, Customs Seized a Smuggling Boat, Both Imports and Exports Were Not Declared and Were Confiscated</h3>
<p>Recently, customs has been very strict in inspecting smuggled goods, because some small steamships are speculating in smuggling along the Chinese coastal ports. Their method is to fly the Chinese national flag at inland ports and change to the five-color puppet flag in the occupied areas to load undeclared goods. There have been many cases in the past where they were seized by customs. Yesterday afternoon, another Deli small steamship, with a load of about 70-80 tons, came to Shanghai from Wenzhou, loaded with 58 burlap sacks of tea, 30 tins of tung oil, and 20 pieces of tanned leather, etc. All the goods loaded were not declared for import or export. Yesterday afternoon, when they were about to unload, the customs patrol found out and searched. All the goods were seized and taken to customs and were confiscated. There has been no news of any punishment for the smugglers.</p>
<h3>Quaker Friendship Association's Enthusiasm and Perseverance, Transforming Street Homeless Children, Psychological Treatment Center Established at the Beginning of Next Month, Persistently Inducing and Transforming Criminal Habits</h3>
<p>According to the *Continental Daily News*, the Quaker Friendship Association of this city will establish a psychological "treatment center" for street homeless children at 1086 Yu Garden Road in the first week of next month. This is an important step in solving the problem of child crime in Shanghai and will be praised by those engaged in child protection work. According to Mr. Shelley Kerk, who is responsible for this project, the center will take in frightened and distressed children, treat them kindly, and persistently induce them in order to prevent criminal children from committing evil deeds when they grow up. It will also use the best methods of changing children's psychology to influence ignorant and criminal orphaned children, and then encourage them to work according to their preferences.</p>
<p>Transforming Psychology</p>
<p>In addition, various methods will be used to transform their psychology of fearing others into a friendly psychology. If the parents of homeless children are found, they will be sent back home or trained to familiarize themselves with their favorite work, and then find a job for them. Otherwise, they will be sent to orphanages. The center can accommodate 30 children at the same time and will carry out two weeks of induction. It will then find a way to send them out, which will surely have a good impact on them. Giving each child appropriate induction, even two weeks, can greatly change their psychology and make them loyal citizens when they grow up.</p>
<p>Authorities Sponsor</p>
<p>In addition, it is reported that the Municipal Council's child protection department is very supportive of this project and has decided to cooperate with it. Therefore, the Municipal Council is now conducting a detailed investigation of the individual situations of each child in order to enhance the efficiency of establishing a physical hospital to the extent possible. Mr. Shelley Kerk's psychological hospital will be assisted and hosted by Ms. Zheng Manli, a former professor at a certain missionary school in Wuchang, and Ms. Bi Hainai, a member of the Quaker Association of Sichuan. According to Ms. Bi Hainai, this kind of organization is extremely needed for homeless children, because according to what she usually sees, homeless children are in a difficult situation and criminal behavior is easier to create. She also mentioned the experience of a child, saying that the child was separated from his biological parents in 1937 and wandered the streets for several days, then was adopted by a beggar, who used him to gain the sympathy of passers-by in order to take money, and then was sold to a Chinese person at a small price. The person treated him very harshly and beat him every day. Finally, neighbors were displeased and found a way to rescue him and send him to an orphanage for adoption.</p>
<h3>Japanese Organize the Yangtze River Trade Association, Study the Invasion of Central China's Resources</h3>

<h3>Banta Egg Factory Labor Dispute, Three Female Workers Run Over, Six Male Workers Arrested by Police</h3>
<p>The American-owned Banta Egg Factory at 1 Tengyue Road, Yangshupu, has more than 700 male and female workers. The factory specializes in collecting chicken and duck eggs from various places and shipping them overseas, so it makes a lot of profit. Recently, the male and female workers of the factory, because their wages were not enough to maintain their lives, recently gathered to discuss asking the capitalists to understand their difficulties and increase their wages in order to maintain the lowest living standards during the current period of high rice and firewood prices. Five representatives were elected to repeatedly request the capitalists, but to no avail. The workers had no choice but to announce a strike on the 24th and wait for the factory to resolve the matter satisfactorily. At 6:30 AM yesterday morning, the male and female workers were gathering at the factory gate to inquire about news, and there was an abnormal crowd. Unexpectedly, at this time, a truck from the factory, carrying many employees, disregarding the crowd, sped into the factory from outside, causing the female workers Zhang Xiaomei (26 years old) from Pudong, Xi Mingzhen (21 years old), and Chen Xiangmei (17 years old, namely Zhang Xiangmei), who were at the head of the line, to be knocked down and run over, injuring their heads and feet. Afterwards, the police station received the news and went to send the injured to the hospital for treatment. One said that the factory took female workers into the factory in a truck because the male workers were on strike. When entering the factory, the male workers blocked the vehicle, causing the three female workers on the truck, Zhang Xiaomei, etc., to fall and be injured. It is also learned that afterwards, six workers, Sun Yuanlong, Wang Ziqing, Zhu Genquan, Wu Baogen, Zhu Jiefu, and Yang Genfu, were arrested by the police. (Shewen News Agency)</p>
<h3>Binlang Road Robbery, Father and Son Beaten and Injured, One Thief Captured on the Spot</h3>
<p>An old man from Yixing, Qu Xiaosheng, 62 years old, and his son, Zhushu (26 years old), made a living by setting up a chicken and duck blood stall on Binlang Road and lived at 74 Binlang Road. At 5:30 AM yesterday morning, eight bandits suddenly entered the house with six pistols to rob. Qu Xiaosheng had already gotten up and was immediately frightened into silence. The robbers searched and robbed more than 100 yuan in property and then left with a shout. Qu was unwilling to let them go and held onto the last thief tightly when the thieves went out. The other thieves were shocked and one of them fired four shots at him, hitting his chest and other parts, and bleeding profusely. However, the thief he was holding onto did not loosen his grip at all. At this time, the nearby patrol had received the news and arrived and arrested the thief and seized a pistol. Because the other thieves had fled in different directions, they were not captured. Afterwards, the police station summoned an ambulance and sent the injured old man and his son, Zhushu, who was sleeping in bed and was beaten and injured by the thieves, to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Residents of Baisezhong Road, Strange Guests Break in at Night, Asking About Zhang Surname, Police Arrive and Escape Without a Trace</h3>
<p>Four people who resembled a certain nationality, accompanied by two Chinese people, suddenly broke into 172 Baisezhong Road in the French Concession on the evening of the 22nd. In a threatening manner, they asked if there was anyone named Zhang. The male servant replied that there was no one named Zhang here, and they immediately fled. After the French General Police Department received the report, it immediately sent Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene. These strange guests had already escaped without a trace. Yu Yushan, a local youth who lives at 52 Yongqing Road, Xinda Gu Road, and is now working as a shiptender at the Japanese Mitsui Bussan Kaisha, is 24 years old this year and has a face like the skinny monkey Han Langen, a comedic movie star. Last winter, he met Xie Lianping (19 years old this year), the only daughter of Xie Dougong, an Anhui native who now lives at 5 Kang Village, Pingjili Road, in a dim sum shop in front of the Great World. They fell in love at first sight, and then went to the Yangtze Hotel to have sex. Afterwards, Xie's mother, Xie Huang, discovered it,</p>
<p>Brought it Up for Negotiation.</p>
<p>Yu then asked matchmaker Ding Baokang and Hu Bo to propose marriage. They got engaged at the Xindu Hotel on February 21 of this year and chose a date for the two parties to hold a formal wedding tomorrow. However, Yu suddenly claimed that Xie was immoral and stole diamond rings, and that he could not marry her, so he filed an application with the Civil Court of the Special Second Court to mediate and dissolve the marriage contract with Xie Lianping. As a result, because the woman objected, the mediation failed and a separate lawsuit was filed. The woman claimed that Yu's behavior was bad, that he seduced his daughter, and that after reaching his goal, he applied for dissolution.</p>
<p>Like a Gigolo</p>
<p>Because the woman was only 19 years old and had not reached the legal age, her mother, Xie Huang, acted as her legal representative and hired a lawyer to sue Yu Yushan in the Criminal Court of the Special First Court for interfering with the family and attached a civil suit to recover 50,000 yuan in compensation. Judge Meng Tingke has held two court sessions and the details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday, this case was continued by Judge Meng Tingke of the Special First Court. The plaintiff again accused Yu of committing the crime of using fraud to make a woman believe that he was her spouse and obey his adultery under Article 229 of the Criminal Code. When questioned, Yu Yushan denied having</p>
<p>committed adultery</p>
<p>. This lawsuit by the plaintiff is actually a counterattack against Yu's lawsuit to dissolve the contract, and also filed a lawsuit for defamation, because before the plaintiff filed this lawsuit, he had already distributed the indictment to the newspapers, and also accused Yu of being the second Jiang Jianqiu who specializes in cheating. Then, lawyer Tu Kunfan defended, saying that the plaintiff's accusation of desertion from the family was not true in fact, and the plaintiff's daughter had never left her family. The interpretation of Article 229 of the code is even more inconsistent with the circumstances of this case, so he requested that the verdict be innocent. After Judge Meng reported it, he issued an order that the debate in this case was over and a date was set for sentencing.</p>
<p>Special Second Court</p>
<p>On the side, Yu Yushan's lawsuit to dissolve the marriage contract was heard in the seventh courtroom by Judge Ma Yishu yesterday afternoon. Plaintiff's lawyer Tu Kunfan arrived in court to state the case, requesting that the marriage contract be dissolved and that the loss of 824 yuan for wedding banquets, etc., be recovered, and that the litigation costs be borne by the defendant. The defendant Xie Lianping did not arrive, and was represented by lawyer Li Cheng. They arrived at the court and requested that the plaintiff's words be rescinded, saying that the report had filed a counterclaim, requesting that the plaintiff be ordered to fulfill the marriage contract, and if it could not be fulfilled, then requesting that 20,000 yuan in damages be recovered. As for the litigation fee department, because they were unable to pay, they applied for assistance. After hearing the words in court, the judge ordered that a ruling be made and a date be set for a hearing.</p>
<h3>Arrest of a Bank Clerk for Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Xia Yongtao from Baoshan (residing at No. 9, Anyi Village, North Xizang Road), an employee of Yi Kang Money Exchange at No. 263 Jiangxi Road, told Manager Wang Xifu on the afternoon of the 22nd of this month at 2:00 PM that the mainland branch of a Japanese trading company on Fuzhou Road, with which he had regular dealings, had called and wanted to purchase 13,500 yen in Japanese currency, requesting immediate delivery. Wang, trusting him, ordered Xia to deliver the amount. However, this was a lie by Xia, who actually absconded with the money, taking with him his wife, Ms. Luo, his five-year-old daughter Ju Ming, and his two-year-old daughter Yu Ming, disappearing without a trace. Yi Kang discovered the embezzlement and reported it to the General Inspectorate. Hua Inspector Qian Xianting investigated and apprehended Xia, his wife, and daughters at the Yuan Family Residence in Luodian, bringing them back to the police station. Xia confessed that he had deposited a portion of the embezzled funds with Yuan Dingshan, the owner of Shi Xin Hardware Store at No. 76 North Xizang Road (Xia's guarantor). Upon searching the store, Yuan had already fled, but his wife, Ms. Yuan Wan, was apprehended, and a portion of the original embezzled funds was recovered. Yesterday morning, they were all escorted to the Special First Court's Criminal Division. Police attorney Peng Qixin stated that the case required further investigation and requested temporary detention, which Judge Zhan approved, ordering them to be detained for further interrogation at a later date.</p>
<h3>Gang of Thieves Stealing Flour; Eight Suspects Apprehended</h3>
<p>Around 2:00 AM the night before last (the 24th), a large group of thieves was discovered at the Hua Feng Flour Mill in Yaoshui Lane, Xiaoshadu Road, West Shanghai. Approximately twenty or more thieves, each carrying flashlights and burglary tools, broke into the flour storage area and carried away twenty-seven bags of flour, intending to flee with their loot. However, due to their large numbers and the noise they made, the factory's administrative staff discovered them and raised the alarm. The thieves, unwilling to linger with their stolen goods, fled in different directions. Eight thieves were apprehended, and fifteen bags of flour, a hatchet, and a suitcase were recovered. It was reported that two of the thieves were carrying handguns. Amidst the frequent robberies in West Shanghai, this large-scale theft by a gang of thieves is unprecedented.</p>
<h3>Truck Rolling into Alley Kills Child</h3>
<p>At 6:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 24th), a cargo truck with license plate F2584 was parked in front of No. 300 Gansidong Road in the French Concession. The driver had gone elsewhere for business. A truck assistant named Fei Xiesheng was sitting in the vehicle, in charge of the engine, while two workers, Yu Qiqing and Jin Yi, were pushing the truck from behind, intending to park it in Lane 500 of Avenue Albert. As the truck was being pushed into the entrance of Lane 500 of Avenue Albert, a thirteen-year-old boy named Cao Jinfu, the son of Cao Arong, a local resident living in a bungalow at No. 248 Lane Fulili Road, was playing near the truck, helping to push it. Because the alley entrance was narrow, Cao Jinfu's head was crushed between the truck body and the wall, shattering his skull and causing blood and brain matter to splatter. He was immediately taken to Guangci Hospital but died. The hospital reported the incident to the police, who sent detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the morgue for an autopsy. Yesterday, Chief Prosecutor Zhao Changmin of the Special Second Court arrived to examine the body, confirming that the death was caused by the crushing injury. After questioning the father of the deceased, Cao Arong, and the accused, Fei Xiesheng, Jin Qiqing, and Jin Yi, the judge ordered the body to be released to the father for burial. The accused were handed over to the police department for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Landlady Assaults Tenant Over Mezzanine Construction; Ms. Yang Shi Detained for Investigation</h3>
<p>Yang Dahua and his wife, Ms. Yang Shi (44 years old), natives of Ningbo, recently leased a three-story building at No. 80, Baoyu Lane, Caishi Street, French Concession, with the intention of increasing rental income. They began constructing mezzanines in each room. Ms. Weng Wang (38 years old), a tenant from Suzhou residing in a room above the main hall, objected to Yang's plans and tried to stop the construction in her room, leading to verbal clashes. The Yangs, harboring resentment, gathered a group of thugs on the afternoon of the 24th at 5:00 PM, led by Ms. Yang Shi, and beat Ms. Weng Wang, causing injuries all over her body and rendering her immobile. The incident was reported to the French police, who dispatched detectives and only apprehended Ms. Yang Shi, as the thugs had already fled. Ms. Yang Shi was taken into custody, and the injured Ms. Weng Wang was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Yesterday afternoon, the police sent Ms. Yang Shi to the Criminal Division Eight of the Special Second Court. The police attorney, Chen Ming, presented the case, stating that the victim was unable to appear in court due to her injuries and requested a postponement of the hearing. After questioning the defendant, Judge Qiu ordered the hearing to be postponed to the 29th, and Ms. Yang Shi was detained. It is reported that the police also suspect the defendant's husband, Yang Dahua, of inciting the assault and have dispatched detectives to arrest him for further investigation.</p>
<h3>American Beauty Jarrett Jailed Again</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that American Jarrett, who ran a gambling den on Huaji Road in previous years, was arrested and sentenced to one year in prison by the U.S. Court for China on October 1 of that year. After serving one and a half months in the Ward Road Jail, she fell ill and requested release for medical treatment. The U.S. Court granted her release on the condition that she leave China for five years. Jarrett left Shanghai on December 20 of the year before last but returned to Shanghai twelve days later. She has been staying here off and on since then. Since she did not appear to be staying for long, the U.S. authorities let it go. However, Jarrett recently returned to Shanghai, seemingly intending to stay for an extended period. The U.S. Court arrested Jarrett on the afternoon of the 24th and sent her back to the Ward Road Jail to serve the remaining ten and a half months of her one-year sentence.</p>

At approximately 8:50 PM last night, six robbers arrived, four of whom were armed with handguns. They ordered everyone to remain silent. The armed robbers searched the upstairs bedrooms and stole a gold ring, a gold bracelet, and a diamond ring, with a total value of approximately 2,000 yuan. They then fled. The owner chased after them, shouting for help. The robbers, in a panic, fired two shots, hitting a servant at the hospital, Liao Youfang (48 years old), in the buttocks. He bled profusely.

<h3>Gleanings from Old Newspapers; Sixty-Seven Years Ago (366)</h3>
<p>(From this newspaper published in the twelfth year of the Tongzhi reign of the late Qing Dynasty)</p>
<p>Community Granaries</p>
<p>The system of community granaries originated with Zhu Xi and is superior to official granaries. Official granaries are the ancient ever-normal granaries, established either through donations from officials, gentry, and the wealthy, or by adding a surcharge to land taxes each year to purchase rice for storage. Release is only permitted with official instructions, and officials cannot arbitrarily release the grain to avoid liability. Instead, reports of famine must be submitted by the people, reviewed by the court, and relief can only be distributed after a disaster assessment. In contrast, community granaries are organized by village elders and established in both urban and rural areas. While official instructions may be issued, they are essentially managed by the people. It is understood that official granaries are unreliable in times of disaster, so community granaries are established as a backup for times when disaster has struck but relief has not yet been organized. Release from the granary does not require approval from higher authorities. If the disaster is not too severe, the grain can be sold and the proceeds used to purchase more rice from areas with surplus, replenishing the granary without any financial loss. I once discussed this matter with a Westerner, who was not impressed! He argued that establishing trade routes is better than building granaries, as granaries have a limited supply of rice, while trade routes provide a continuous source. Western countries prioritize this in disaster relief. However, China cannot implement this at present, so the only option is to promote community granaries as a backup when disaster has struck but relief has not yet been organized. However, establishing community granaries is difficult. Although Ningbo has been organizing community granaries and inviting gentry to form committees for half a year, several areas in the countryside have yet to do so, and donors in the city are delaying and observing. In fact, this is not unique to Ningbo. When promoting community granaries in various prefectures and counties, it is impossible to treat urban and rural areas equally. Zhu Xi's system of community granaries was modeled after the ever-normal granaries but with improvements. The current desire to establish community granaries stems from the many problems with charity granaries, with gentry donating and the people contributing, but officials managing them. It is feared that they will still be insufficient in famine years, hence the plan to establish community granaries. Charity granaries are established by officials, while grain is donated by the people. It would be better if managed by the gentry, but even with gentry management, official approval is still required, and reviews by higher authorities cause delays. This is the main problem with official management.</p>

<h3>The Oppressed Group: The Encounters of Escort Miss Lan Zhen</h3>
<p>— Zhong</p>
<p>The escort service itself is a mere facade, an empty signboard. Selling dog meat under the guise of selling sheep - almost everyone who lives on this isolated island knows this. When the young masters, after their fill of food and drink, only know that they have paid two yuan an hour to enjoy the corresponding rights, do they know the pain suffered in the hearts of the escort girls, living a subhuman existence!</p>
<p>The backgrounds of the escort girls, apart from a very few who willingly degrade themselves, are almost all due to impoverished families, forced to resort to such a strategy. Lan Zhen, the daughter of the old woman Huang who lived next door in the Three Calendar Lane, is one who was forced to walk this path. It is said that they used to be a family of modest means. Since their shop was destroyed by artillery fire in the war, her husband risked his life to run back to see the assets that were the lifeline, only to never return. This left the two of them, mother and daughter, lonely and helpless. In this time of high living expenses, they relied on washing clothes and selling bean curd, managing to survive for a full nine months, which was no easy feat. They washed clothes all day, and at night they couldn't sleep, still having to peel bean curd to prepare for the morning market. But the rice, costing eight dimes, wasn't enough for them to drink porridge for a day. Firewood prices had risen so much that they couldn't afford to buy it. They begged the second landlord to do a good deed and let them cook porridge when the stove was free. But the rent was overdue again. When the mother and daughter were worrying about how to survive, A Mei, who worked as an escort girl in the pavilion, finally overcame Lan Zhen's pride.</p>
<p>Relying on her beautiful appearance, Lan Zhen's business was indeed good at first. But later, because Lan Zhen was too self-respecting, she forgot the true nature of this profession, and so business gradually cooled down. Not having enough to eat didn't matter, but clothes had to be made even if she had to borrow money. The owner of the escort service, both to win them over and because it was a good source of income, lent ten yuan, with an interest rate of two yuan per week. Once you borrowed the money, you couldn't quit, but a large part of the daily income was deducted for interest. Although Lan Zhen knew this was like drinking poison to quench thirst, she still felt it was more honorable than the gifts given by customers in exchange for satisfaction.</p>
<p>For some reason, Lan Zhen has changed recently. Everything has changed. Her lively and innocent spirit has become listless, and her pink and white face has gradually turned pale and thin. Her bright, electric eyes have also become a little dull. But she said she wasn't sick. For the sake of her old mother, for the sake of survival, she had to keep going, to endure the endless torture. When she put on a forced smile in front of customers, a bag of blood and tears that couldn't be cried out welled up in her heart!</p>
<h3>A Word on Granting Loans to a Certain School</h3>
<p>— Ruo</p>
<p>In this era of constant turmoil and instability, being able to survive on this isolated island of Shanghai is already a great fortune. And we, the students on the consumer side, relying on the hard-earned income of our parents to support us, while also receiving the energetic support of the school, to have the opportunity to study, is an even greater fortune! Therefore, we should understand the difficulties of the current situation, and strive to make use of the limited opportunities to pursue deeper learning. This is the most basic thing to do. However, there are some students - perhaps a very small number - who still do not realize that their situation is already much better than that of most people, and complain that the support from their parents is not enough for their expenses beyond tuition. We must know that the situations of our parents, apart from a very few who possess abundant assets, are mostly middle-class or salaried workers. In this present time of rising prices, being able to support the lives of a family of several people, while also providing for their children's education, is already a very difficult and strenuous task. Therefore, we must never complain about our parents.</p>
<p>In this situation, we heard news that a certain school recently, seeing that some students' parents were originally in the occupied areas, were concerned about the inconvenience of remittances, or that news was unknown due to the fall of the area, which would cut off their support and affect their studies and lives, hence the provision of loans. This is originally a good way to provide relief. But given the above situation, there is concern that another group of people who do not need loans will also request them, which would then take away the loan money from those who need relief. Therefore, I hope that the school authorities will set out a strict examination procedure. First, is the applicant's hometown occupied? That is the most important thing. Second, even if it is occupied, were their parents in that area before it was occupied? This must also be noted. On these kinds of matters, substantial proof should be provided. This is to prevent some students from receiving substantial expenses from their parents on the one hand, and then applying for loans from the school on the other, spending the money outside indiscriminately, resulting in an outcome that is far from the original intention of the program. Although loans must eventually be repaid, we must take precautions beforehand to avoid affecting other parts of the people who truly need assistance!</p>
<h3>The Maid, Ah Li</h3>
<p>— Hovering</p>
<p>"Madam, spare me! Spare me!" A miserable cry for help came from the bungalow next door. I opened the window and listened carefully for a moment. The voice sounded more and more like that of the pitiful girl, Ah Li. Alas! She really suffered too much! She was only seven years old this year, and her thin and weak appearance always made her look sick. Moreover, her pale face often showed traces of dried tears. With disheveled hair and bare feet, she was busy helping the madam with housework all day long, without any free time to tidy herself up. I remember once her madam gave her more than ten pieces of clothing and told her to wash them all clean within an hour. At the same time, she instructed her to cook after washing. She washed there silently. But she was really too short to reach the high eaves to dry her washed clothes. She raised the bamboo pole up again and again, but still couldn't reach. The madam standing beside her not only had no intention of helping her, but also, with a look of disgust, beat her and scolded her desperately.</p>
<p>In the past few months, the madam's methods have become even more vicious. She even limited the child's food intake, while she herself ate like a fat pig, playing mahjong and watching operas all day long. Whenever something unpleasant happened when she returned, she always took it out on this little friend. She often told us when the madam was not around: two years ago, she had a most wonderful family, no siblings. She was indeed a unique little treasure at home. Unfortunately, in the summer of the year before last, her father passed away within a few hours due to an acute illness. The poor mother was so worried and anxious that she was often sick, and all the money had been used up. So she repeatedly persuaded her mother to sell her to someone to be a maid, so that she could get some money to treat her mother's illness. But how could her mother bear to do that?</p>
<p>This year, because she was really oppressed by life, she had no choice but to sell her to this madam. She also said: These days, her mother is even more destitute, sleeping in straw piles at the alley entrance every day. Sometimes her mother came to visit her, but she always suffered the merciless scolding of the cruel madam, who did not allow her mother to enter the gate.</p>
<p>This pitiful little girl, I wonder when she will be able to jump out of this miserable cage!</p>
<h3>Lion Tamers and Malarial Mosquitoes</h3>
<p>— M.Chin.732</p>
<p>Jack Howard is famous for lion taming and often associates with lions and tigers. In his lion taming career, he has been attacked and injured by beasts several times, but has always recovered. Therefore, many have advised him to abandon his profession. The scars on his arms, abdomen, and legs are all left by the teeth and claws of ferocious beasts.</p>
<p>His friend, who performs flea circuses, once tried to explain to him that the poison of mosquitoes is more dangerous than lions and hippos. However, Howard dismissed his words as mere hearsay.</p>
<p>One day, Howard decided to explore the wilderness and make on-the-spot observations of the natural environment of wild animals. Once the plan was set, he departed with a team of hunters into the interior of Africa. A film company agreed with this famous lion tamer that if he could enter the wilderness without weapons, encounter a lion, and make it flee in terror, they would reward him handsomely. Howard gladly agreed. The result was that the astonishing scene was a success; Howard used his divine skills to make the lion panic and flee into the tall grass.</p>
<p>Half a month later, Howard suddenly fell ill. He suffered for several months and was repeatedly on the verge of death. When he finally regained some strength, he sought medical treatment. The doctor diagnosed him with a severe case of malaria, and the source of the illness was the bite of a malarial mosquito. The doctor followed the methods prescribed by the Malaria Committee of the League of Nations, administering treatment of fifteen to twenty grains of quinine daily for five to seven days. He recovered, and to prevent malaria, he was to take six grains of quinine daily during epidemics.</p>
<p>Page 125 of the 1938 report of the Malaria Committee solemnly declared that among all the drugs for preventing and treating malaria, quinine is still the most widely used because of its remarkable efficacy, lack of toxicity, and the fact that its usage and dosage are known to every household.</p>
<p>The lion tamer, after being treated with this good method, soon recovered. As soon as his strength was restored, he hastily left Africa, unwilling to stay another day. Upon returning to Chicago, he went to see his friend who performed flea circuses and told him, "My friend, your words are absolutely true. The harm of insects is indeed greater than that of lions, for wild beasts only leave a few scars on my skin, while a tiny mosquito almost took my life."</p>
<h3>God Above All (2)</h3>
<p>This is not an interesting, nor a particularly optimistic situation. We are in this predicament, and we can only blame ourselves. Historically, similar situations have happened before. Many kinds of social institutions are erected, but soon collapse. The reason for such things is a lack of a true and durable foundation. Greece once had a great culture centered on beauty, but neglected character. Rome once had a powerful empire based on valor, but lacked religious faith. Babylon once had astonishing commerce, but lacked benevolence and kindness. Therefore, these cultures inevitably collapsed and perished. Our current social system is already collapsing, and I think the reason is that we have not learned a great and lasting lesson: There is only one path in the world, one philosophy, that gives people lasting peace and power. Please see the first chapter of Genesis, "In the beginning, God." You will understand this philosophy. Today, most people have forgotten this sentence, and thus are trapped in the current mess. They do not understand the great teachings and perfect example of Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus was the greatest man who ever lived, and the things we consider important today, he did not have. The manger where he was born, the donkey he rode, and the tomb where he was buried were all borrowed from others. When he died, the Roman soldiers fought over his possessions, which were only the clothes he wore. His disciples were poor, and he let them remain poor materially. "Do not store up treasures on earth," "For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul?" This lesson we must learn. Jesus encountered economic instability, social evils, political fraud and corruption. His world was quite similar to ours today. But, in fact, he never specifically addressed those social problems, doesn't that seem strange? At that time, there were many who had no clothes, no food, no homes, and many who were sick and needed healing. Others asked him loudly to address those urgent problems, but he said that to address those problems, one must first solve a more pressing problem, which is, "In the beginning, God." This is the most important thing in life. Jesus taught people, healed people, preached God, and in his private life, always put God first. He took the work of his Father as his priority, carried the cross, and ended his physical life in the embrace of God, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit." Jesus' life began with God and ended with God. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>After the Rain, Clear Skies</h3>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 23: Old Friends, New Companions, New Articles Have Value; Famous Scenic Spots are Well-Managed by the Right People</p>
<p>At that time, everyone had a special photograph taken. Besides Qu Wushuang and Shao Huihua, the newspaper also had many photographs. Qu Wushuang took the opportunity during the dinner to solicit articles from them, either for publication in the "Women's Garden" or the "Women's Knowledge" section, whichever they preferred. She knew that they each had specialized knowledge and could write well, so she made the request. The fact that everyone had a special photograph taken just now was also intentional. Putting their photographs alongside an article is a popular trend these days. This allows readers to appreciate their beauty while reading their writing. Everyone naturally agreed, but not without some modesty, saying, "I'm afraid our writing is clumsy and our reasoning unclear. We might write something that isn't presentable." Shao Huihua jokingly added, "I knew that you sisters wouldn't be getting a free meal tonight. As expected, something was thought up to make you write. I say, Wushuang sister, your methods of soliciting articles are unparalleled. Your methods of soliciting articles are even more ruthless than the conscription methods during the warlord era. Originally, this dinner was my treat, but she wanted to snatch it away. If I were the one treating, I wouldn't make you sisters rack your brains to write articles." Qu Wushuang said, "Huihua! Stop teasing! I know you sisters will definitely support these two publications and each gift me an article." Later, among these people, the first to submit was Wu Junsha, who wrote about the relationship between education and literature. Qu Wushuang was very pleased and published it in the "Women's Knowledge" magazine. The second to submit was Jin Danyun, who spoke very insightfully about women's social interactions. She said that Eastern women have inherent virtues and should not blindly follow the West. This article has been translated into Western languages and reprinted in foreign magazines. The third to submit was Zhu Airen. Although she was very busy with the affairs of the infant hospital, she still managed to write an article. Her article was about promoting the popularization of nurseries and daycare centers. The last to submit were the two He sisters. Naturally, they wrote about the preparations for establishing a silk weaving factory. They had been a little busy lately. Also, having been abroad for a long time, they were not very comfortable writing in Chinese. If they were asked to publish in a foreign language, they could write a grand article. Later, He Shuangyu wrote an article on her views on revitalizing the Chinese textile industry, but she felt that the writing was not good enough to be presented. She gave this manuscript to Wu Junsha to polish it, and then it was submitted to Qu Wushuang and published under the names of both Shuangyu and Liyu. This is a later story, so let's move on for now.

<h3>The Father of Cartoons – Walt Disney: From Humble Artist to World-Class Artiste: Success Results From Diligence and Deep Thinking</h3>
<p>— Hai Feng</p>
<p>Since the release of the full-length animated film "Snow White," the reputation of this great father of cartoons, Walt Disney, has been even more shaken. Perhaps it was more than ten years ago when Walt Disney was quite unsuccessful, just an ordinary American young artist working the night shift in an art store. He accidentally discovered a peculiar phenomenon: every time the night was deep and silent, except for the sound of the artist's brush ceaselessly painting, the only other sound was that of mice scurrying around the office. The artist did not dislike the mice, and felt quite interested in them, he befriended them, keeping a dozen of them in a cage, feeding them and playing with them every day, and even training one to stand on his drawing board as a model.</p>
<p>Eight years later, the Mickey Mouse cartoon, created from Walt Disney’s ink bottle, was released with great fanfare. This is the origin of Mickey Mouse, and the origin of cartoons as well. He named it Mickey Mouse, and it was born at the same time as the revolution in cinema – the sound film. During the development of Mickey Mouse, the cartoon also changed. He first published a series of short films called “Alice’s Wonderland”.</p>
<p>When Walt Disney was a cartoonist at a newspaper eleven years ago, he and his brother Yiwei opened an animated ink painting company in Los Angeles in 1923. Their joint investment was only five yuan, but they had a very good spirit of hard work and excellent skills. The first series of short films they published was the Alice cartoon.</p>
<p>Although this series of short films was very popular from the beginning, he still maintained his resolute attitude, strong will, hard-working spirit, and clever mind to improve and develop it. Disney thought that introducing a live actor might increase interest. So, he used the method of double exposure to bring a girl alive in the ink painting film. He did this for two years, and the results were quite satisfactory. Later, he began to produce a series of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit ink painting short films.</p>
<p>Disney is still young. He is full of youthful energy, and all of his energy is expressed in Mickey Mouse. Therefore, Mickey Mouse is a lively animal that is never tired. During working hours, if you are not familiar with Disney, it is difficult to recognize him among his colleagues. Although he is the boss, he does not use his authority to influence his colleagues.</p>
<p>According to recent reports, Walt Disney is currently working on the design of three colorful full-length cartoons, "Bameri," and is trying to collect small animals that will appear in it. As for what the content will be, readers should wait and see.</p>
<h3>Laraine Day: A Rising Hollywood Star and a Model of Fitness</h3>
<h3>News from the Peking Opera Scene</h3>
<p>— Wen Yuan</p>
<p>The famous actor Xi Xiaobo recently led</p>
<p>the Xi Opera Troupe to Shanghai to perform at the Golden Theater for nearly two months, with great success. He took the Shuntian back to the north on the evening of the third. He arrived safely in Tanggu on the morning of the seventeenth, and then transferred to the west. He arrived safely in the old capital on the afternoon of the seventeenth at seven o'clock. Representatives of Guangde and other theaters, as well as relatives and friends from inside and outside the industry, totaling more than a hundred people, welcomed him at the station. In addition to Hou Yulan, Gao Shenglin, Wang Shaoting, and Wang Jiushan, who returned to the north from Shanghai on the same train, the famous female performer Xu Xiuwen and her party, who had finished performing at the Shanghai Imperial Palace, also arrived in Beijing on the same train. After resting in Beijing, Xi Xiaobo immediately reorganized the Zhongxin Troupe with Chen Xinqin and Wang Jiushan, and will perform at Guangde, Kaiming, Sanqing, Qingle and other theaters in the near future.</p>
<p>Shang Heyu, Shi Huibao, Cheng Jixian, Xiao Changhua, and Zhu Guifang, five veteran actors performing elderly roles in Beijing, are long in years but enjoy great reputation. It is said that these five elders are the fruits of the pear orchard, Shang and others are indeed worthy of it. The ages of the five people are investigated as follows: Shang Heyu is 68 years old, Cheng Jixian is 67 years old, Xiao Changhua is 63 years old, Shi Huibao is 59 years old, and Zhu Guifang is 50 years old. The total age of the five people is 307 years.</p>
<p>Ma Lianliang and Zhang Junqiu left Beijing on the morning of the seventeenth and have arrived in Qingdao. They will perform at the Guanglu Theater on the evening of the 22nd. The supporting actors of the troupe, Ma Fulu, Ye Shenglan, Li Hongfu, Yuan Shihai, etc., will depart from Beijing for Qingdao on the 19th. Ma and others are expected to arrive in Shanghai early next month.</p>
<p>Mao Shilai, one of the four little famous female performers, is currently in Qingdao and plans to perform in Qingdao after Ma Lianliang. Whether she will come to Shanghai to perform at the Golden Theater, together with Sha Shixin, Jiang Shiyu, etc., is to be decided. Sha Shixin came to Shanghai last time but did not receive good reviews. After returning to Beijing for recuperation and training, he will make a comeback this time and will work even harder, it is said.</p>
<p>Xi Caiyun, a famous female Ping opera performer, recently suffered from neurasthenia in Beijing and has been hospitalized for treatment.</p>
<h3>The Dispute Between Xinhua and Mei Xi – Caused by Advertising Ranking</h3>
<p>— Hai Xing</p>
<p>A new rumor has spread in the film industry: Xinhua is going to abandon Mei Xi. This will surely surprise readers. Just imagine that Xinhua is actively recruiting talents, and Mei Xi is a first-class young actor who has emerged after the war. Moreover, the full-page advertisements published by Xinhua in the Shenxin newspapers on the 19th still featured previews of Mei Xi's four films (Yanmenguan, Xishi, Su Wu Herding Sheep, Sakyamuni). How could they suddenly abandon him?</p>
<p>It is said that the reason for the abandonment was caused by that advertisement. Originally, the new contract between Mei Xi and Xinhua stipulated that the size of the name published in the advertisement must be the same as that of the female lead. However, in the preview of the films on the 19th, there was a film called "Yanmenguan" because there were three leading actors, Yuan Meiyun, Mei Xi, and Gong Qiuxia, so Mei Xi's name was ranked a little smaller than Yuan Meiyun's. Mei Xi immediately sent a letter to Zhang Shankun, the owner of Xinhua, the next day, believing that this move violated the contract and that if there was no proper solution, he would terminate the work immediately.</p>
<p>After receiving the letter, Zhang Shankun thought that Mei Xi's actions were unreasonable, and expressed his willingness to abandon Mei Xi, even if Mei Xi was unwilling to continue filming the unfinished "Xishi," it was not impossible. Xinhua's reason is that Mei Xi's salary after the war was 130 yuan per month, and after several raises, his current remuneration is already 7 or 800 yuan per month. At the same time, Xinhua also allows him to work for other companies and obtain unexpected rewards. Therefore, it can be said that Xinhua has treated Mei Xi well. This time, the advertisement ranking, in the four film previews published in the Xinwenbao, three of them were the same size as the female lead, while those published in the Shenbao and Damei were all the same. It can be seen that this was a clerical error and not Xinhua deliberately failing to fulfill the contract. Mei Xi suddenly turned hostile and seemed to ignore old relationships too much. Zhang Shankun said decisively: "If he wants to use such means to deal with me, I am willing to give up, no matter how big a star he is!"</p>
<h3>The Lessons "Xi Shi" Gave Me</h3>
<p>— Wei Borui</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Relief Committee for Zhongshan Refugees hired the Yong'an Yue Opera Troupe to perform "Xi Shi" at the Lyceum Theatre. The reporter was prepared to watch it. The theater had two floors, covered with luxurious colored carpets. The attendants were all dressed in red uniforms. The seats were also red sofas, extremely luxurious! In the center hung the four characters "Benefit Disaster Victims." On the left and right corners of the stage were placed large red flower baskets, quite pleasing to the eye. At seven o'clock, the audience gathered. Such a grand scene proves that the great spirit of Zhongshan exists forever in the hearts of every citizen.</p>
<p>The drama "Xi Shi" has profound meaning and can reflect the current era. The drama tells that on the male side (Fan Li) he abandoned everything for national and family revenge; on the female side (Xi Shi) she destroyed her chastity and maintained her loyalty to repay her benefactor. In other words, both men and women sacrificed the small self to achieve the great self, which can be a mirror for our 450 million compatriots. The drama is divided into eight acts: each act is wonderful! The scenery is even more vivid and lovely! Finally, Fan Li retired successfully and sailed on the Five Lakes. He abandoned fame and wealth and roamed outside of material things. This is a noble character; I hope that those who have seen this drama will never forget it!</p>
<p>What is the lesson that "Xi Shi" gave me? It is that the spirit of Zhongshan is immortal! The national spirit of China will last forever! (Gratitude) The above is a recent picture of Ms. Zhou Xuan in ancient costume, and Mr. Chen, the inventor of the toothpaste for which Ms. Zhou is an endorser.</p>
<p>Film News (1) Walt Disney's newly completed "Pinocchio" has been released simultaneously in the Nanjing and Shanghai Grand Theatres yesterday, with unprecedented grandness. It is indeed the greatest contribution to the film industry this season. "Pinocchio" is a full-color three-dimensional film, and both the production and painting can add a different color to art. And in terms of the story, it contains a deep meaning of educating children. People in Shanghai, please do not miss it. (2) "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer", starring Mickey Rooney, has long been famous at sea and sensational in the film industry. Now, the young writer Duo Shengjun has translated Mark Twain's original novel into Chinese, which is a long-awaited good news for ordinary movie fans. Major bookstores in this and other cities are on sale. (3) "China Film News" issue 6 is published today, and the content is more detailed than before.
