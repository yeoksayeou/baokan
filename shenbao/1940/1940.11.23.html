<p>社評</p>
<h3>電話加價</h3>
<p>輓近上海電話公司父以行將加價聞。說之流傳已久，前曾一度刺戟電話股價，使之上騰，但其後復歸沉寂，蓋大的在工部局考慮中故也。至前一星期，報載工部局擬定電話加價暫行辦法。計有三原則除新裝電話押櫃及遷機裝置分機增加費用外，而用戶經常貢担之增加。則爲數允鉅；一即減少基本通話决數：營業電話由一百五十决減爲一百决，住宅電話由一百决減爲大十五决；綜其成數以言之，的各減少用戶通話之權利百分之三十：此外又各增加月租費百分之三十；冉加以超出基本通話决數以外之通話費；每次自三分增加至七分，則所增又在百分之一百三十三。假定一營業電話按月通話三百决，照舊章月租十元外，超過之一百五十决，每决收費三分計爲四元五角。合計之爲十四元五角。照新章月租十元，通話一百决。加附加費百分之三十，爲十三元，超出之二百决，每决七分，計爲十四元，合計爲二十七元。大凡營業電話超出平均决數，雖未獲得統計，敢信其不止二百次；即照二百决算，用戶按月所增加之費用，已達百分之八十六，然若通話之决數超出愈多，則其增加率愈大，簡言之，謂今之電話加價，比原有加起百分之一百，亦不爲過。反對之者：上海電話之發達，純由於租界內用戶之增多，今反加重其負担，殊屬不智。亦有謂所增加數目之鉅大，一旦付諸實行，非特工商業將蒙惡劣影響，大部居民，勢將不堪負担。故以爲最近雖經兩租界市政當局予以通過，但一般用戶仍望當局對電話公司收支狀况，再行鄭重審譏；如加價勢在必行，亦當滅少其加價之成數，此報載用戶方面之意見。亦即暫行加價辦法所引起之反響也。</p>
<p>竊謂公用事業，原以便利公衆使用爲目的，旨在使公衆出最低之費用，能得最大之享用。故市政方面對於公用事業待遇特優，許其獨占營　，所以保障其應有之利益，亦無非欲使其爲公衆　忠實服務也。惟其如此，此類事　以市辦爲上。徒以官營精神輒不如商辦，於是公用事業之由市辦而重歸於商辦者，比比而然。旣歸商辦；商人自與一般營利事業，作同樣看待，斤斤較量於其資本之孳息；一朝利益不能如其所期之願望，則不問負担之爲如何，勢必出於提高代價，以求償所欲；於是名爲公用事業而實與私人企業無以異，此又商辦必然之弊害，而市民則受其殃矣。</p>
<p>電燈電熱電力加價矣；公共汽車電車加價矣：自來水自來火亦加價矣；即使電話公司無加價之必要，能不怦然心動，而思傚允乎？况處此物價高昂之候，欲加之價。何患無辭，則電話公司此决毅然出於加價，不能獨責以非。即在市政當局旣許各種公用事業加價於先，獨不許電話公司步武於後，寗得謂事理之平。於是加價旣爲普遍之事實；所爭者只在加價之程度高低而已。夫電話加價經過數月之考慮，而許其如此加法，自必有其應增應加之理由在，當非率爾邀准者可比。惟當注意者，公用事業旣欲增加公衆之負担，萬不可以一般物價之高漲，而以爲公用事業所得之代價太低；亦母以私人營業之暴利獵得，而不忍公用事業有向隅之嘆，凡此，深知市政當局決不存此念：然而經營公用事業者能保不作此想乎？公司憑其文書以爲考量，則所聲請之理由，必振振有辭：所提供之證明，必周密無遺。况在洋商經營之下，幣値之觀念允重，以在中國投資經營之事業，而仍處處以外匯核算之，於是外匯短縮，價即隨之以高；然知第一决歐戰時外匯大長，當時公用事業固未聞減價也。</p>
<p>今者工部局審核與市民福利攸關公用事業之加價事件。自必先爲市民利益計，而後爲事業者利益計。但公用事業既欲增加大衆以負担，亦當使大衆知其負担之所應增，與其負担之由伺而來，然而今之加重大衆以負担者。祇知有此負担之後果。而不知所以有此負担之事實原因。此則安能使大衆樂於負担而無間言耶！</p>
<p>或謂加價之事實，容有牽涉於其營業上之秘密。故無可以公開之理，然則所以加價之故。豈盡有不可吿人之處耶！有以知其不然，蓋惟公用事業之地位與一般工商業不同。故其行動，自應予大衆以共見共聞之機會也。</p>

<h3>歐戰痛史（三）　法國悲劇中三主角　（三）窮於肆應的萊諾</h3>
<p>這篇所叙述的是法蘭西大悲劇中第三位主角萊諾，他和達拉第甘茂林輩現都押在維希附近監獄中，靜待最高法院判決是否誤國。原文係法國名記者特聖瓊de　Saint　Jean所作。他自一九三五年至一九三七年曾任巴黎晚報倫敦分社主任，歐局吿緊，始返默隨工作，迨戰爭爆發，乃加入法國政府情報部任職。原文載美國於Harpet’s　Magazine，茲迻譯於後：</p>
<p>法國這决的戰敗，可說是古今罕見。在一個極短時間之內，因軍事而影響政局，且牽涉到許多國，翻遍世界各國史，實找不出同樣的例子。這幕悲劇在今後若干年中，必成爲世人研究的一個重要問題。</p>
<p>當荷蘭比利時被侵之前，西綫戰事並不緊張，所以這决戰爭的決勝時期，可說是始於五月十日，而終於六月十三，歷時僅三十四天。其實雙方決勝的時間，或奢還不及此。法國柯勒普軍陣綫的被突破和主力軍的瓦解，都發生在五月十七日。所以不論法國軍隊如何勇敢，不論法國軍備如何充足，在這七天工夫之內，巳被打敗了。</p>
<p>以敵我兩軍接觸時間之短，法國所受創痛之鉅，各種離奇謠言因之畫起。有人說：「法國之敗，是由於內奸賣國。」還有人說：「法國前總理某，去冬曾在瑞十秘密接洽，竟爲了數袋金錢，把法國出賣給希特勒。一此種風說，當然足以使人驚心動魄，可是賞際並不如此。法國之　，與其說是由於軍事，不如說是由於政治原因居多。</p>
<p>法國軍事失敗，不出下列數因：空軍落後，已有多年，一也；法國駕駛員，可與世界名手並駕齊驅者不少，徒因飛機製造量不足，所以本年春間，還在待「機」而動。戰車寥寥無幾，二也；法國兵工廠在整個冬天，多注全力於製造重砲，而不注意於戰車，實則這次閃電戰中，重砲幾一無所用，三也；防空設備的無端遲延，情報機構的弱點畢露，四也。其允重要奢，廠爲軍事當局墨守成規，不知隨機應變。若說一九一佣年的歐戰，法國曾先事準備，面非確論，但至少要比一九三九年的歐戰，準備充足得多，可以母庸爭辯。一班曾經參與上决歐戰的宿將，經騐固然豐富，見聞未免不廣，居然把那些策劃新職術的靑年將校壓倒。「記憶巳往」的呼聲竟比「想像未來」要高。馬奇諾防鐘是根據上次壕塹戰的經騐而造成的偉大工事，以舊抗新，認爲不僅可以　滅現代的侵略者，且可掃蕩一切軍事上的新學說。</p>
<p>凡此種種缺點，在領導法國國運直至屈伏爲止的袞袞諸公，未嘗不曾見到。國務穗理萊諾，對鈴法國的各種罪惡，多年以來，早經大聲疾呼，痛下針砭，以致不慊於人，然而一且執掌國政，竟一籌莫展，無力挽救浩刦。這種怪現象，乃欲明瞭法國此决悲劇的重要關鍵，非僅關係這位內閣總理一身而已。</p>
<p>法軍戰敗之日，卽五月十七日那天，全國士氣，並未銷沉，祇須獲得一個小小的勝利，定可益加奮發。萊諾政府始終揭緊他組閣時「加緊作戰」口號，奮勉進行。然而在五月十七日那一天，達拉第雖和他不陸，依然做着陸軍部長，甘茂林雖不得他信任，依然掌握統帥大權。作戰能否加緊進行，却要靠總理所要罷黜的陸軍部畏和總司令身上，眞是糟不可言了。萊諾以反對前任的政策而取得政權，却未能澈底澄淸，舊派勢力依然可以左右政府。總之，萊諾執掌政權，祇有八十七天，他的短命內閣，便慘遭傾覆，然在他任期之內，對於平素熟知爲靠不住的人，竟會曲予保留，古人所謂「惡惡不能去，」萊諾是焉。</p>
<p>難道萊諾自己並無主見，所以容他們繼續操縱作戰方針嗎？絕對不是如此。這位內閣總理，對於國家大事，向來不同流俗。他在未秉國政以前，早巳養成一種自信力。然而他內閣中听羅致的人物，却都是碌碌庸才，他們所發喪的意見，是否高明，也就可想而知了。</p>
<p>三月二十一日，萊諾內閣成立，當天晚上，萊諾對他親信說道：「我組閣得太早了。」道句話在今日聽了，未免奇怪，因爲一切巳經證明，卽使他掌權得冉早些，也未免有「太遲」之感。實則萊諾的話，確是別有用意。三月二十那天，國會舉行秘密會議，許多議員放棄投票，顯見他們對鈴達拉第，祇要像小學生犯過失時，僅加「申斥，」而不願遽行「開除。」萊諾以爲中問尙須有一過渡內閣，自己且待稍緩再行登台。不料達拉第的聲勢，衰落之速，出人意外，在衆議院僅得信仟票二百三十九票，而棄權的竟有三百人之多，自知難以戀棧，於是決計辭職。是日午後，總統卽召萊諾組閣。</p>
<p>萊諾親友一聞此訊，莫不爲之雀躍，然而喜氣洋溢的還不止萊諾的友人，就是他的政敵也在暗地裹稱快。依附達拉地的一班人物，以爲新仟總理，不過五日京兆，一旦掛冠，達拉第卽可東山冉起。那天未投達拉第信任票的議員，多來向他道歉，要求原諒。當萊諾正在物色人村，預備組閣的時候，達拉第的政治勢力，又在遂漸嘭脹了。萊諾聞訊，不得不改變方針，他知道沒有達拉第，事情必然難辦。因爲，達拉第是急　黨的領袖，是法國一般人的代表。他貌似謹願，說話帶南方音，口才辯給，語語使人動聽，所以不論是兵士，城裹人，或鄉下人，都易受他的感動。</p>
<p>萊諾却適得其反，形狀像一個有錢的布爾喬亞，身材矮短，態度生硬，言語帶着鼻音，演說時頗有頣指氣候的神情，使令人望而却步，達拉第到馬奇諾防綫視察的時候，頭戴舊軟帽，身披大坎肩，形式很是隨便。萊諾去的時候，却是高冠盛服，態度尊嚴。所以達拉第常爲衆望所歸，萊諾從來不得人心。</p>
<p>所以在三月二十一日那天，萊諾不得不把他的政敵拉入內閣忍痛畀以陸軍部長一席；他知道非和這個頭戴軟帽的人合作，必致毫無辦法。</p>
<p>新總理沒有黨派憑藉，要得多數的擁護，確非易事。達拉第是急進社會黨的黨魁，勢力頗大，內閣沒有他支持，或是和他的黨派反對，決不能發號施令。總之，國會機構，早巳失其運用，今天推翻一個總理，歡迎後任的人起而改絃更張，明天却父强迫後仟者保留前任的遺策。像這種翻雲覆雨，自相矛盾的情形，法蘭西眞正的民治主義，早已名存實亡了。（未完）</p>

<p>匈京　匈牙利當局今日指稱、匈牙利加入三國公的之主耍目的、爲建立長久之歐洲和平半官勞逸報稱匈牙利之參加三國公的、增加國家之聲望、但同時增加匈牙利之責任、三國公的之目的爲使戰爭不致蔓延、同時建設三洲之新秩序關於匈與蘇聯之關係、該報指稱、與蘇聯維持友好關係乃匈牙利外交政策之耍點、匈牙利之加入三國公的、使此項關係益見鞏固、（二十二日海通電）</p>
<p>羅馬當局闡釋　三國公約目的</p>
<p>羅馬　此間官塲人士談稱、匈牙利加入三國公的絕無保留條件、故公的全文無須加以修改、匈牙利對公的三簽字國、願在政治與經濟方面予以無限制擁護、匈牙利之加入三國公的乃爲其他國家樹先例、參加建設歐洲新秩序、由此可以證明改組歐洲之三國公的、巳具有吸引力、此間官塲人士繼續闡述三國公的之目的如决、（一）限制戰事擴大鼓勵任何國家勿捲入戰禍、（二）保障三國公的有關各國之勝利、（三）鼓勵其他國家加入三國公的、共爲建設新秩序、使在政治及經濟領域內提高各國之生活水準、就英國各報之評論而論、匈牙利之加入三國公的、英國顯亦自知在威望上遭一新的打擊、（二十二日海通電）</p>
<p>羅國加入盟約　並無重大意義</p>
<p>倫敦　路透社外交訪員稱、德國所控制方面最近傳出之消息、如果實現、則羅馬尼亞將繼匈牙利加入軸心、查羅國被迫作重大犧牲後、東南歐乃有所謂「新秩序」之建立、今軸心國複强迫羅國加入盟的、而與匈國保證此「新秩序、」此或可視爲不近情理、惟羅國加入軸心時或不若匈國之大事喧張、軸心國今無對南斯拉夫或保加利亞卽將有所行動之象、而德國亦無準備忽遽援助陷於窘境的義國之任何證據、義國對希作戰現已達危急之點、唯德國立卽予以强有力的干涉、始能挽回危局、然德國殊未必有此能力、第若謂軸心國將置南國或保國於不計、則未可斷言、德方果派軍隊　保國攻希、則土耳其將認其極重要利益遭受威脅、因而牽入戰禍、至於德方所宣傳蘇聯將對付土國之說則在事實上未有根據、且土總統近曾重申蘇土兩國關係之友好性質（二十二日路透電）</p>

<p>安加拉　聞德駐土代辦曾於日前通知土政府、謂德國對於希義戰事無論如何並無採取任何行動之意、惟土耳其非官方人士對此保證、並不過予重視、土政府現正採取進一步手段、以使政府機構適合國家之各種需要、最近希軍勝利之消息、巳引起安加拉人民之欣慰（二十二日路透社電）</p>

<p>猶在蘇聯政府考慮中、吾人有理由可信此建議乃蘇聯堪以接受者、刻正待其答覆、吾人父對於因蘇聯兼併土地而起之各問題、提出折衷辦法、而亦對於英政府現有之義務、予以適當之顧慮、吾人復爲增進兩國邦交祛除容有的誤會起見、提出若干性質廣泛之建議、此中梗概巳兒諸報紙、凡此皆爲成立兩政府間在政治方面之更大信任計也、上述各建議、尙待答復、故余現未能對於此事續有陳述云、英外相言及</p>

<p>給予希臘用符吾人所負之責任與義務、此乃英國之已定政策、無待贅言、三星期之希義戰事、巳證實吾人在希臘拒絕義國最後涌牒時對於希臘而具之欽仰、確有理由云、英外相復言及墨索里尼所稱希義戰爭其咎全在希方一節、謂黑索里尼雖向義國人民力言、如事進行順利、然義國人民旣開泰蘭吐港義艦摧毀之消息、復覩其領袖野心所招致的、戰事失利之恥辱、漸不能無動於中、而覺其領神徒以鸚鵡式單調敎其國人歌功頌德而已、世界上如有赤裸裸的搶刦戰爭、則爲此對弱小民挨而施之戰爭、今此弱小民族已向世界表示其擁護自由之勇氣與精神、較諸軍隊衆多、更爲有力、如其古歷史所已表示奢然、在世界史中、</p>

<p>冷血陰謀察墨氏此决論調可見墨氏深以十月二十八日希臘拒絕其哀的美　書爲異、其所謂希臘事前準備聯英攻義者、直托詞耳、墨氏自謂渠得德元首同意、直接參加攻英、英政府於此必認義國參加轟炸婦孺之舉動、徒逞殘暴、全無理由、自當予以相當注意、英國現仍等候義軍從里比亞方面之進攻、埃及英軍戰士與戰具業已大增、埃及與蘇丹各要點、皆有重兵駐守、故埃及與近東各處今皆愈堅其信任之情緒云、英外相最後言及美國積極助英事、謂軍火輸入源源不斷美總統近且聲明、交美國所製戰具約十分之六供給英國、（二十二日路透社云）</p>

<h3>糧食　洋米又到二萬餘包　日商在市上兜售安南米　投機米商對之大爲氣餒</h3>
<p>滬上洋米連續有到、昨日又有怡和洋行定生輪、由香港裝來七千五百二十七包、停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、法公司西江輪、直接由西貢運來一千噸、的合一萬教百包、亦於昨日下午五時許抵埠、停泊十一十二號浮筒、今日開始起卸過駁、又前日太古公司濟南輪、由香港裝來七千一百五十三包、已誌昨報、茲悉該輪另有洋米四千二百八十一包、共計有一萬一千四百三十四包之鉅、並此更正、</p>
<p>洋米昨日到旺銷細　市面已經趨平、而市塲謠風父不利於買方、投機搶風之皮球生意、隨因市價直綫式下降不能施其技、然一部份投機者翻多爲空、又度其賣空買空之故技、且新交易雖無華洋商續拋、然日商因其在越南之地位便利、船位之充實、水脚保險之低宜、前晚與昨日卽在市兜攬交易、市上雖無正式交易、惟聞已有電洽　或可於下月初卽有試掛到申、因此人心頓時浮動、期現兩貨早市立小、午後再跌、晚收雖被補空拉好數角、然結果期現貨均比前晚小去一元以上、二號西買早市現貨八十二元七八角、下午八十二元、比前晚八十三元七八角則小去一元七八角、十一月上午八十二元半、下午八十一元八角、較小一元半、十二月八十元零八角、小一元、一號十二月自八十四元半至八十三元半、進戶尙有還到八十二元半者、小紋上午七十九元半、下午七十九元、亦小一元、全日回籠七百多噸、現米七千包、</p>
<p>新粳尖及野稻茶種等到貨不旺、然銷塲亦屬不暢、所以形成供求供勻、悉現定格、若原句新粳仍開九十二元革九十元、斛見八十八元至八十六元、野稻八十九元、菉種八十一元、杜洋尖亦相仿、</p>
<p>糯米去路平常、惟以市貨無多、售價亦乏軒輊、宜溧白元八十五元革八十三元、香港白元七十八元半、七十五兀、</p>
<h3>麵粉廠盤　又有提高之議　日廠粉運北方</h3>
<p>麵粉市况、明定暗緊、蓋自米價昂貴以來、現粉本街需用頻增、更有客幫之問津、雖有少數洋粉到滬、未能大量供應、是以局勢逐步暗緊、聞廠方以原料一再高昂、且無法收買、故擬將廠盤再行提高，刻正在商討中、因此回籠貨老車棧單復有囤戶之貪取、價須十九元四五角、洋粉同時堅佾、雙鷹牌售開十九元、由本街收進二百五十包、至華廠批出二號粉八千餘包、價仍爲十七兀、客盤仍爲十八元半、但無正式供給、</p>
<p>至麵粉運津、外輪久已絕跡、惟日輪運往者仍若不少、其貨全係日商三興廠出口，昨日有麵粉六千包、運往威海衛、係回頭貨、（卽由威海衛運來之生仁所換）、父昨日怡和洋行定生輪、由香港運來洋麵粉八百包、</p>
<p>小麥趨勢、亦屬暗挺、蓋以到貨久稀，華廠方面、欲購無貨、洋麥來源亦受阻礙、是以廠方繼續放價、以招遠貨、聞日廠亦擬以二十八元收價、再向行商訂購云、</p>
<p>昨日出口、有苞米四千包、運威海衛、又三百包、運烟台、</p>
<h3>金融　外滙出籠　爲數益巨</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、滙豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美滙暗市、本日稍見軟化、昨日電傳日軍將積極南進、有在泰國登陸說、多戶出籠較增、反之扒戶除外銀行有吃胃外、甚爲缺乏、下午港電傾塞爲數益巨、一度美滙做開五元九六八七五，惟結果仍穩、比上日軋鬆零一五六二五與零三一二五、計英金三辦士七六五六二五、美滙五元九三七五、期貨美滙軋平、遠期英金稍形拔開、</p>
<p>外銀行仍收進</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠期均降零六二五、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、滙兌英對美·滬等均平、美對英·滬等無市、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士七五、美滙五元九零六二五、與上日晚收不分軒輊，開後華商投機家略有塞出、市面帶硬、計十一月份爲五元九三七五、同時矣行亦售現美滙價五元九三七五、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉低百分之零·二五、此後港電賣出若干美滙、本月份價仍五元九零六二五、以上全係外銀行吸入、以其吃胃不弱、潛勢雖鬆仍穩、迄至午刻、父傳日軍圖在泰國登陸、人心未受影響、時某美行出外行本月份美滙依然吿五元九三七五、午收價英金三辦士七六五六二五、美滙五元九三七五、此晨開各畏零二五六二五及零三一二五、</p>
<p>港方猛烈塞出</p>
<p>後市港電猛塞、美滙曾做五元九六八七五、物港電出下月份先令三辦士七六五六二五、並出同月美滙五元九六八七五、嗣華行金城來進同月美滙、美行結予爲五元九三七五、投機商亦賣予有利均爲五元九三七五、晚收英金現貨及本月份三辦士七六五六二五、十二月份三士七五、美滙一致爲五元九三七五、比上日英硬零一五六二五、遠期不更、美滙期現俱長零三一二五、</p>
<p>香港美匯鬆動</p>
<p>香港二十二日（週五）電、今晨滙市開盤牛穩，各滙概無變動、（英滙現貨昨收硬至一先令三便士、遠期不動、）十一時三十分吿平、美滙現貨硬零六二五、爲二三允六八七五、其餘不動、下午二時三十分開盤平穩、申滙現貨降一元五角、爲三百九十六元五角、其餘不動、</p>
<p>天津聯鈔狂跌</p>
<p>天津二十二日（週五）電、今晨滙市開盤吿鬆、倫敦電滙硬一五六二五、爲四便士一五六二五、紐的電滙長二五、爲六元六二五、申滙猛降四元、爲八十八元五角、「聯鈔」暗盤在賤四元二角五分、爲九十二元、</p>
<h3>金市近午突降</h3>
<p>昨現金烚赤暗市、初　定、於午刻突展開跌　、乃於十一點卅分起、忽盛傳日積極南侵、且外匯在港　巨額賣勢下、突由穩轉鬆、各方人心因之趣疲、自晨開卽承上日頹勢、低爲五千六百七十元、嗣進出均散戶居多、價僅十數元起落一度抬至五千六百八十二元、詎至午刻，利賣傳說忽起、外滙又報硬、遂起跌勢、證券　銀號匯票商力售、下午某錢莊賣小至五千六百廿二元、但外匯不久經匯豐等英行吸納、突止鬆小回、價亦因現金號傾進　上、終爲五千六百卅五元、計軋小四十五元、全日交易共三千六七百兩、現金比期交價的低六七元、未聞做開、飾金關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤跌四十五元</p>
<p>晨初以外滙開出略長、人心稍疲、開盤銀號出令號卅兩、吿五千六百七十元、較隔昨收盤低十元、嗣冉因證券幫力塞、續挫十元、計銀號對做廿兩、退達五千六百六十元、惟此時散戶見賤、紛紛來買，價遂回升，計銀號入錢兌業卅兩、爲五千六白八十二元、但不久銀號幫又來　出、致重向下落，計金號沽予銀號廿兩、僅五千六百五十二元、午收銀號對做十兩、亦祇五千六百五十七元、午後爲狀不振、乃銀號幫多頭不斷吐出、初銀號對做廿兩、爲五千六百二十五元、後證券幫稍吸、漲起二十元、計證券幫入銀號卅兩、五千六百四十五元、而銀號又出證券幫廿兩、祇五千六百二十元、收盤前金號買進、潛勢中止、計入銀號卅兩、五千六百四十元、再進十兩、爲五千六百三十五元、作晚收價、收後聞做五千六百二十元左右、比上日軋撳四十五元、全日有五十元上落、現金號之本牌金售價、較烚赤高十數元、收進低三十元、現標余照掛牌金低五六十元、均鮮做餚、</p>
<p>首飾金尙無變動</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、始終不動、計大同行掛五百八十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<p>美票每況愈下</p>
<p>外幣市况、烚赤市價、盤旋趨下、英美金鎊、因亦各降一元、英金票仍鮮交易、市價呆定如故、美金票每况愈下、晚市退爲十六元三角六分、比上日終降一角七分、香港票　勢堅挺、晚市高至四元、日金票及朝鮮票、供求均勻、市價站平、前者仍爲一元五角三分、後奢仍爲一元一角五分、</p>
<h3>紗花　投機心思看小　棉紗直瀉　雙馬進二百元關</h3>
<p>紗市續　、且跌風殊熾、此因投機者心思看落，人心一致向下、同時實際銷路、較爲减色、多說西買事件、利於空頭、於是賣奢異常踴躍，放空額紛粉活動、一時籌碼鬆懈、市盤乃逐步下降、二十支雙馬最後敲破二‘元關門、推大戶及銀行界之，多額、始終鎭靜而無動意耳、今日有紗九百四十件運香港、</p>
<p>現紗影開、因境環不利、大家多說不　、一致傾向賣方、二十支雙馬首盤價爲一千二百二十元、頃刻間跌至一千二百十七元、旋聞外滙寗靜無變化、又復漲至一千二百十三元、豈料價格一高、拋寧頭愈形活躍、市况再行下向、一千二百十二元、然在一千二百十餘元間　旋頗久、後傳言紛紜、賣戶忽濃、一霎間打破一千二百元關口、爲一千一百九十八元收盤、查半日間成交統計六千二百三十包、行情二十支變馬跌三十元、茲將各幫買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>香港　一二五同行六、一五〇</p>
<p>統計六、二三〇</p>
<h3>棉價尙難鬆動</h3>
<p>現棉情形寥落、因紗市疲憊乏力、廠家更無意採辦、但存底日見　减、所以心意堅昂、售價仍難鬆動、大致情況、亦在進退維谷之間耳、</p>
<p>外棉市價紐約棉市、昨日爲感謝節、全美停市一天、印度停市、預測測降落二羅比餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來始終靜寂異常、廠方購意又轉淡薄、同業又不願廉售其手貨、故全日市上交易淸淡也、</p>
<h3>紗價驟落的原因　說不無與增加棉布「統稅」有關</h3>
<p>花不常好、月不常圓、棉紗的蓬勃景象、日來的趨勢、又將如過去的漸漸地暴露了、試想每上半天、常做五六千包交易的、照越昨的情形、統共祗做二十支雙馬三千六百七十五包的交易、較前减二千包左右、價自開盤的一千二百三十九元微高至中盤的一千二百四十二元、顯然的荏弱無力、革收盤又回小到一千二百三十六元、這是二十一日的行市、到今天（二十二五的筆者撰稿時、開盤父承隔昨下午暗盤再小的影響、開價僅做一千二百二十元、中間曾微高至二十三元、卒仍不支、逐步跌落革十七元、十一元、十四五元、而小到一千二百〇九元的低價了、（按最後收盤是一千一百九十八元、）</p>
<p>採訪紗價驟跌的原因、普通眼光的觀察、不外是（一）實際銷路又呆滯、（二）外棉電訊下跌、（三）棉紗囤積仍厚、（四）緬滇路運貨內地、猶未實現、（五）季節外銷落令、上述五點在棉紗市塲上混進混出者、夫人而知之、</p>
<p>還有一種「紗價驟跌」的大原因、就是棉布的出廠統稅、將要於下月（十二月）一日起、實行增加了、所以如申新新裕等廠、都巳登報通吿、催執有棉布廠棧單的顧容、限期於本月底前、須一雜出淸、吾則統稅率變更、應歸顧客負擔、這一條催命符、對鈴棉紗市塲貿賣不無影響、執有棉紗廠單的顧客、誠恐棉紗稅率也要變更，不願出貨者粉粉圖脫手、籌碼一增多、反使做多頭朋友的心思退縮了，再加市塲上有阿部赴渝求和的風傳，一片喊賣聲、紗價立刻就盤旋直降了、聽內行同業諸友的談論、照目前情勢與環境、二十支的變馬價、恐一千二百元也必站立不住了、因此外行投機、也唯內行傳說的馬首是瞻、跟着做空了、同時搶帽子奢漸漸束手、交易的額子、亦日益减少、再不像上月中旬的生氣蓬勃了、環境如此、人爲的翻雲覆雨、和欲擒故縱的技巧、亦只是曇花一現而已、（駒）</p>
<h3>證劵　內債昂昂然直上　各債中多見新高峯</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨市　續上漲甲乙丙戊四　均冉發見新高價、丙種曾衝出四元、戊種亦高達四元、惟因漲勢過猛、引起多頭出籠及放空之湧起、而回小五六角，但仍比隔日漲數角至一元外、大漲小回、是浮多之見利即結關係、華僑之大量吸收、半因和平空氣之濃厚、半因游資之充斥、市價易於抬高、蓋由於此、昨日上午、其買進奢如價孚恒康新華德孚數家、均係代表金融界或華僑買進、如久豐昌記恒孚震康鴻大同康等或有補空、或有投資需要、亦極興奮、同順仁昌生大中孚大通聯益、或斬多、或放空，大都吿失敗、午收除丁種外、餘均父見新高價、午後信孚新華鴻大繼續買迆、八號及十四號聯和怡泰聯益均有需要、乙丙戊種均又見新高價、仕昌協興兀忽來放空已爲有機可乘、於是裕興同順及大部散戶紛紛賣出、市價乃稍稍回鬆、但結果仍比隔日好起五角半至一元一角不等、成交總數有三百五六十萬元之多、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易成交南洋烟草公可股五十股、價十六兀二角、又大中華火柴等股九十股、價二十五元、</p>
<p>昨日衆業股市，復甚穩定、英聯與墾植二股、比較最爲活潑、成交價較前略優、經營者大多似不願在週末將多頭過夜、但亦並不急於賣出、結果市況在絕對堅穩中收盤、橡皮股略有需求、</p>
<p>倫敦二十一日（週四）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市仍吿平滯、行情概無變動、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布人氣虛怯　龍頭細布大跌</h3>
<p>廠布昨市平　、乃緣紗價連貶、人氣虛怯之故、惟粵港幫現銷踴躍、浙間幫墊進各貨、需要亦旺、因之售盤下挫甚微、白貨粗細布·斜紋·色布每疋跌一角至二角半、綸昌怡和等廠羽綢·貢緞·漂布缺俏、各檔反提漲每疋二角半革五角、粵港幫辦府綢·漂布·粗布·色布等五百餘件、閩浙幫辦漂布·色布·色斜等二百餘件、本街成交各貨六百餘件、國外新加坡等地辦色布、漂布等三千餘疋、二十三日疋頭運香港一千六百件、</p>
<p>東布昨以投機散戶傾向賣出、市盤續跌、龍頭細布在跌每疋一元强、後市收盤降至三十四元四角、中檔細布跌六七角、細斜僅跌二角半、嗶嘰跌二分，四君子嗶嘰收盤爲一元〇六分、蓋以同業中人心仍堅定、而業外拋售故龍頭跌洛最甚、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲經略有成交</h3>
<p>昨日絲市，紐的無市、橫濱現貨一三五〇元維持價、近期十一月份一三五四元、遠期一三八二元、絞前日小一－二元、本埠絲市外銷零落、怡和進七八分、白廠西·七〇〇元、輯里三·四〇〇元、成交二十擔云、</p>
<h3>油市　生油稍漲卽逝</h3>
<p>昨日花生油市、在晨初因現貨有港幫問津、人心續見向榮、行情曾比上日市續升半元外、至午後有大囤戶趁高出籠期貨、一般搶帽浮多、見風轉舵、市氣頓呈暗淡、市價步　下游，結　　貨擯持期貨反挫二元外、豆油實銷依然懈淡、市價究屬難好，叉見回落半元、統計成交膠州豆油五十件、價爲七十五元五角、烟歧豆油二十件、價爲七十八元、大有餘廠油五十担、價爲八十四元五角、膠州生油二百五十件、價爲七十八元至七十七允五角、靑島生油五十桶、價爲一百零七元五角、訂十二月下交一千餘桶、價自一百零七元二角半至一百零八元、　步瀉至一百零五元五角、烟台生油四十件、價爲七十七元、及聽裝油一千聽、價爲一百零七元、</p>
<p>廿三日有豆子六百六十包、豆餅七千九百十塊、生仁四百包、生油五白六十聽、芝蔴四百包、蔴油四百三十聽、均運香港</p>
<h3>南北貨　榨茶來源防斷　價以外費大故亦高昂</h3>
<p>四川榨菜、近來漢口方面、直接稍有運到、作外費極大、故到數不多、查市上存底甚薄、行盤相當高昂、售至二百八十元、如無續到、勢必斷檔，後市絕無鬆望、</p>
<h3>糖市　車白復軟　國糖出路爲所把持</h3>
<p>昨糖市因交易至爲零星、續見下游、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白外棧貨叫七十二元半、原盤、未成交、荷赤現貨仍五十六元、十二月十日打單者同價、太古車白B嘜西棧七十四元半、小三角、DY嘜西棧六十九元三角、東棧六十九元、小二角、HX嘜西棧六十九元一角、東棧六十八元八角、小三四角、國糖絕無開出、蓋出路爲某方把持、致成久疲難振之局、昨由香港來糖一百五十包、</p>
<h3>海味　麒茶生粉　俱見挺昂</h3>
<p>麒菜市存單薄、頗有供不應求之勢、售價因是堅昂，昨開冲獅毛菜爲七十一元二角、西蘭菜六十八元、决之六十五元五角、龍牙菜六十二元六角、</p>
<p>生粉存稀銷活、各標父遞升二元、查上檔更缺、後市尙看續緊、西谷米帶好、大小粒均售七十八元、</p>
<h3>煤炭　煤球漲無止境　有再加十二元</h3>
<p>煤球廠盤、前旬曾一度漲價八元、各界以近來煤球質地低劣、嘖有煩言、不意日昨市塲又揚言各廠棧單、再加十二元、同業自車由一百四十元漲至一百五十二元、一加再加漲無止境、殊堪浩歎、惟各廠現售價參次不齊、尙有仍售原價者、頗不一律云、</p>
<h3>藥材　梔子軋缺續漲</h3>
<p>黃梔子因來源久乏、如汕頭福建等處、均無運到、故市存異常軋缺、現在行盤叫升十元、尙無多數可以供給、後市非俟新貨到申、決無鬆落希望、</p>

<h3>美限制僑民　游歷遠東</h3>
<p>據咋日外人方面消息、在目下遠東危機尙未完全消滅之時期內、美政府對於人民請求簽發前來遠東之護照、已有嚴格之限制、據稱、每日均有不少美國人民欲來遠東游歷、但均被拒絕簽發此項證書、以向國務院申請簽發護照者、必須說明旅行之理由、申請者若爲商人、則尙有核准之希望、若係遊歷性質、則一槪禁止、至於婦孺、則已絕對無法領得此項旅行護照矣、</p>
<h3>滬越通航　照常維持</h3>
<p>自日兵企圖在西貢登睦後、越南情勢頓呈緊張、中國政府已下令封鎖祺越交通、並停止發給旅行護照、所有貨運郵遞、均吿中斷、惟滬越間航運、據大光社記者探悉、目前仍維待通航、法國郵船公司之貨船金第亞號S．S．Kindia於前日由西貢載運大批洋米抵滬後、業已起卸竣事、準定於二十五日（星期一）由虹口順泰碼頭啟椗、直放西貢海防、該輪僅載有棉紗布疋等五千餘噸、並不搭客、叉該公司之西江輪、巳於昨日傍晚由西貢抵滬、由西貢運來洋米一萬四千二百餘包、繫泊第十一十二兩浮筒至嗣後續航與否、朋須視越局發展而定、</p>

<h3>寗波鼠疫　已經撲滅　本市不致波及</h3>
<p>江海關此决宣布浙海駛滬航輪實施檢查鼠疫辦法、係鑒於寗波發生鼠疫所致、滬甬一宿之程、爲預防傳染起見、對浙海駛滬船隻、施行嚴厲檢查制度、以策安全、現在滬甬本無直達航輪、自轉經其他口岸搭輪來滬者、在浙境內復經過相當旅程、此於鼠疫患者之病體上、殊爲不適、有此數層原因、故上海方面可望不致波及、現悉寗波鼠疫、已經撲滅、故本埠史可安心矣、江海關浙輪檢疫辦法亦未實際施行、</p>
<h3>旅客經乍浦　殊多危險</h3>
<p>自滬甬航綫封鎖後、旅客柱返均假道乍浦、今據乍浦來人目覩者談、日軍藉口防止鼠疫及防止他種行動、狀甚恐惶、故數天內將錢江封鎖、不准船隻往來浙東、華人不知細情、仍將船隻開來、日軍見船近岸、卽以小鋼砲擊之、將船擊破下沉、受傷溺斃甚衆、然有未受傷者圖下水逃生、將近岸邊、日軍叉驅之下水更以機槍掃射、全部慘遭覆沒、故此後往返旅客、切勿再轉道乍浦、以免危險、</p>

<h3>各慈善團體昨開會　決議冬賑方針　物價高漲加緊籌集款項　半設庇寒所並施米施衣</h3>
<p>本埠各慈善團體、以時屆冬令、米價高漲、受凍餒之貧民、勢必增加爲謀擴大救濟起見、特於昨日下午六時、假白克路功德林、召開聯席會議、出席者有難民救濟會。上海慈聯救災會·仁濟堂·中國紅十字會·紅萬字會等十餘團體、商討擴大籌募冬賑款項等問題、結果甚爲圓滿、</p>
<p>物價高漲貧民增加</p>
<p>大中社記者、昨曾叩詢仕濟堂某君關於本年度冬賑之設施情形、承吿如下、「本年度本市之生活指數、較去年度幾高達一倍、而本市各工廠外銷貨物、遭受日封鎖或內地原料未能運滬、致有裁撤工人或减少工人之舉、由於上述二種原因、致貧民之數量、亦大爲增加、而本年度冬賑、亦因物價高漲而增加支出、例如去　施棉衣一套、價値僅三元左右、現則非七八元莫辦、故開辦冬賑、須加緊籌募款項、允冀各界熱心人士、慷慨解囊、以襄善舉</p>
<p>冬賑辦法共分五項</p>
<p>今歲冬賑之具體辦法、分下列數項、（一）隱貧救濟、（二）設庇寒所、（三）施粥·施米、（四）發饅首、（五）施衣、關於隱貧救濟工作、吾人將施行詳確之調查、獲悉處於飢寒交迫景况下、雖亟須救濟而難於明白乞求者、將發給衣米、庇寒所每年冬季例行舉辦、但今歲僅收容老弱殘廢者、散發饅首之救濟工作自去歲試辦後、成續良好、今年將繼續施行、</p>
<p>議決施衣辦法兩項</p>
<p>關於施衣之具體辦法、本埠十餘慈善團體、於前日（二十一日）假仁濟堂召開之聯席會議上、業已商定、計（一）爲防止所施與者將施衣變賣起見、概由各善團分發、並予以鮮明之標誌、（二）私人捐助分發施衣、須確知對方係窮苦者、然後發給、又今冬施衣之假定總數、的爲五千件左右、但視經費之情形而定、總之、吾人於飽暖之餘、勿忘飢啼號寒之貧民而予以援手、亦爲人類同情心之表現也、</p>

<h3>蒔花會的秋色（下）</h3>
<p>— 愛農</p>
<p>旁邊二張桌子陳列的，是另一位中國會員孔志淸先生的出品。這决孔先生得首獎獎憑，其作品自有價値，參加的盆景共有二十餘點，以水石盆景爲多，大大小小，種種不一，一盆有一盆的詩情，一盆有一盆的畫意，彷彿在國畫展覽會中，看到許多名畫家的山水精品一段。所有各種盆栽也剪栽得當，純以技巧見長。盆景中最有意義的，要算是以萬里長城作背景的「黎明」，在這小小的盆中，可以見到中國的大好河山，依舊無恙，使人不自覺地起了愛國之心。他的桌子上放着好多張名片，方知孔先生是以此爲職業，在白樂商塲中新樹一幟，常川陳列他的作品，以後倒常有觀光的機會，承他送了我一盆神仙牌肥料粉，據說是最新發明，專供盆栽之用，一經施用，兩星期卽可使盆中花木十分鮮妍，我帶回去倒要試一試哩。</p>
<p>更有其他西人的出品，分門別類每類都集中在一條長長的桌子中，而在桌上的菊花，配備着各式各樣的花瓶花籃，目不暇接，來不及一樣樣地欣賞了。還有西洋學校裹學生的出品，五光十色，陳列着也楚楚有致。</p>
<p>左首的一間大廳，陳列着大型的菊花，型式都是整齊而有規矩的，配得西方人的口味。而各種果蔬也大半是西方人所食的，然而無論一顆菜，一根蘿蔔，都是新鮮肥大，使任何人看了都會食指大動。</p>
<p>這樣的走馬看花地欣賞，足足費了二小時之久。那天晚上，竟做了一個花團錦簇的好夢，彷彿身在衆香國裹，眞個飄飄欲仙哩。（完）</p>
<p>看不到影戲，只好把廣吿來欣賞；無非是畫餅充飢，望梅止渴罷了。誰是一大獨裁者？」</p>
<p>「是卓別林。」在將要噗嗤一笑之前，我們覺得在這將笑未笑的一刹那間，裹面倒着實有含蓄，有文章呢！</p>
<p>這影片究竟將如何的敎我們發笑，我們且不去管他。不過却利說：「笑總是有益衛生的。」進一層，他父說道：「笑笑也可以叫世界上行爲不檢者知所自愛。」所以他演製這張片了的目的，據他自己說，單純得很。</p>
<p>右面一張的確是廣吿，是紐的泰晤士報上的影戲廣吿，眞像本報每大所刊的廣吿一樣，不知要哄動多多少少的影迷，去看這世界唯一笑匠的傑作呢。</p>
<p>卓別林之爲義一笑一也，猶之我們在廣吿上看見：“Lipton　Meanstea”－離秘頓奢「茶」也－一般。一看見他的大名，沒有不會發笑的。因之以卓別林來主演「大獨裁者，」也無非是取個鬧兒，我個笑話的意思罷了。可是世界上的事，越是簡單，越覺得顚撲不破。見了卓別林三字已經早就叫人發笑，何　卓別林就是代表「獨裁者」！</p>
<p>上月十五，星期一，「大獨裁者」初决在紐的與世人作相見禮。Astor和Capitol兩大戲院同時獻映，時間是晚上八時三刻。主角卓別林於星期六日，悄然從好萊塢搭乘「美航機」赴紐的，在拉瓜地機塲下來，寄寓在紐約的友人家中。獻映之晚，他和片中主要配角，自己的太太寳蓮高黛德女士，和扮演劇中拿破里尼（注意里尼兩字）的傑克哇凱，一同參加獻映　禮。受到影迷們瘋在似的　迎。卓別林攝製此劇時，共攝　片五十萬尺，選剪了十二大本，足映　小時又四十分鐘。</p>
<p>這千呼萬喚始出來的「大獨裁者，劇情究屬是怎樣一回事，要叫卓別林化上兩年的長時間和一百二十萬美余的鉅大資本去攝製呢？其實卓別林儘管在各種片子中表演着沒頭沒腦，神經錯亂，或傻子似的滑稽舉動，以及叫人哭笑不得的種種「苦在肚裹，笑在面上」的表情，他本人却是個苦幹，實幹，硬幹，－（這三個詞句似乎沒有什麼好笑罷）遇事一絲不苟，富有組織能力的一位事業家。如果把銀幕上所看到的，已經化身的卓別林，去對照那本來面目的卓別林，而以爲他竟是個一而二者，那沒差之毫厘，就要失之十里了。而這位笑匠之祖，如何能永遠坐在笑國的寳座上，穩如泰山，而一些沒有風吹草動的樣子呢。</p>
<p>我們要知道，卓別林的引人發笑，是一種至性的笑，這種笑不受時間空間的束縛，不分男女老幼的區別，凡是「人」，便會笑，因爲笑，纔是人。反轉夾說，看了卓別林的滑稽舉動而能笑的，這人便也會哭。卓別林是以哭的哲學，引起笑的發生。凡是悲哀，無吿，痛苦，壓迫的程度愈深，他所表演出來叫　　笑的成份愈厚。「大獨裁者」劇情的所以堪喜可笑，也實在因爲它內潛悲哀痛苦的　方太多了呢！</p>
<p>「大獨裁者」的本事很簡單，一看就會發笑，再看更覺好笑，三看以至四…五…那沒簡實除了笑之外，其他一切都沒有了。原來這故事的最後結局，在獨裁者的本身竟是一塲春夢，那個小猶太　髮匠，在絕對「無意」之中，把萬想不到的事實，加在獨裁者統治下的全能國身上，－發動革命，眞是個笑話！</p>
<p>金聖嘆臨刑時曾說。。「殺頭痛事也，而我以「無意」得之！」卓別林劇中的無意之處，其軍量堪與金聖嘆口中所說者相埒。喜劇總是喜劇，眞像天下的烏鴉總是一樣黑的哩。</p>
<p>「大獨裁者」的故事，簡要的說起來，應如下面所述：</p>
<p>一個名叫亨格爾的小猶太人住在土馬尼亞國中，在第一决大戰時，在前錢充當小兵。因受砲大的震蕩，飛機爆炸的驚恐，成爲一個記憶全忘，不能說詀，半瘋顚而患有心病似的人。那時他國中的一位獨裁者，名AdenoidHynkel（也是卓別林所飾，與理髪匠同姓名，）漸漸得勢，大權獨攬。亨格爾幸虧患的是「心神喪失」之症，對於獨裁者的一切設施，倒也不覺痛苦。退伍還鄉之後，他做理髮匠度日，因爲得罪了獨裁者的衝鋒隊隊員，遭官家逮捕甚急。這時候獨裁者的一個得寵副官史乞爾滋，前曾在戰事中受過亨格爾的恩惠，總算以德報德，沒有把他拘捕。</p>

<h3>宴會的成功與失敗</h3>
<p>在社交界中，舉行宴會是一種很平常的事情，無論在家裏或者在菜館裏舉行。的確，宴會的　　，可以使我們交到時許多的朋友，實行社交生意。</p>
<p>在舉行宴會之前，也用許多事情要做，第一，我們先得　定舉行宴會的地點。如果我們的家裏陳設得相當清潔，那東就可以在家裏肖行，不但費用較省，而且賓客也可以有更多的樂趣，否則就可以在菜館裏舉行。</p>
<p>第二，我們得　定被請人的名單，在幾天之內，把請柬送去，同時我們也得决定是一　茶會，還是午宴成省晚宴。</p>
<p>在舉行宴會的當天，最好通知每一個被邀請的人，使他們都能談來。然後對於各種佈置褚如餐桌，陳設等，和賓客的　樂問題，也找　　加以準備了。</p>
<p>如果我們做主人請客，一定得使每一個客人　典而數，這一點就　要充足而活潑的精神。</p>
<p>在進食的時候，流利生動的交談，往往能　使宴會非常生色，我們得淸楚　　，仔細　　，這二點需要很多的精神。</p>
<p>在吃完以後，就得使每一個客人有相當的淸　，一桌　　，或是　　，或者賞訣幾本有趣味的書篇，開　縷電或者玩弄　　　。</p>
<p>總之，一個宴會的成功與否，必須看主人的招待週到和客人的　　態度而定。</p>
<p>假使我們患瘛頭痛，牙痛，風濕痛，或者月經痛，我們就不能使宴會成功了。</p>
<p>假使我們為急軟想見，吃了一點不好的止痛藥，到後來發生反應起來，將成什麽情形？</p>
<p>這種問題是很容易解决的，最簡便而安全的止痛方法是服用數利痛，吞服一片或兩片，疼痛就在十分鐘裏終止，無論疼痛的程度如何嚴重，都能　移止，而且因為藥性和平，毫無濾弊。</p>
<p>散利痛是瑞士競爭孟羈氏有限公司製發的，該公司所製造的藥品，都是十分可靠的，所以遇到急要的時候發生疼痛，可以用散利痛來解决當前的問題。</p>

<h3>在我的崗位上</h3>
<p>— 之瑜</p>
<p>老天像有意作難我們似的，今天碰到我們服務安全運動的宣傳工作，它却毫不客氣地下起毛毛雨來了。</p>
<p>七時半了，我傘也不撑的急急地趕到學校裏去，去領那「安全第一」的臂章：跑進學校的辦公室，冷淸淸的一個人都沒有，的確，時候是太早了，還沒八點鐘哩！數分鐘後，同學們三三兩兩的來了，辦公室的自鳴鐘也噹噹地敲了八下，可是辦事先生還沒有來。</p>
<p>「八點鐘了，我們上崗的時候到了，怎麼臂章還不發呀！」一個同學不耐煩地問着。</p>
<p>「×先生還沒睏醒，怎麽會發？」另一個同學回答着。</p>
<p>「等一息吧！別嚕囌了，當心他來了，」級長好意地可囑着。</p>
<p>大約這樣的議論了十餘分錡，×先生搖擺着來了，嘴裏還啣着雪茄，手裏捧着一捲紅的臂章，還含糊着說，「不要緊，早上人還不會十分多的，遲幾分鐘也沒有什麼關係。」雖然，他是明明知道自己不守時刻。</p>
<p>爲了已經過了上崗的時候，我們不得不急急地趕到崗位上去。工作也就是這樣地開始了。</p>
<p>我們的崗位——愛多亞路——相當熱鬧，起初來往的都是那班神聖的勞働者，有背着包的賣鹽媽子，有挑着擔的賣菜姑娘，她們見了我們，當我們「特別巡捕」，怕我們捉她們到「行」裏去，所她們不等我們開口，就飛也似的逃跑了，她們被巡捕先生們「捉」得怕極了。</p>
<p>行人漸漸的多起來了，我向他們一一的發着傳單。</p>
<p>有些人當我們是賣「神丹」的，他們見我們走近連說「不要」就走，當我們向他們解釋時，他們反給了我們一個「白眼」，在他們中間，有大多數是西裝筆挺的「紳士」。</p>
<p>我們向一般摩登太太或小姐們發傳單時，她們常常是高傲地一睬也不睬的繼續着她們「美妙」的步伐。大概他們是不願從大衣袋裏伸出玉手來接受這種「不値一錢」的紙頭吧！</p>
<p>接連「觸」了四五十個「霉頭」，我眞氣極了，我呆呆地立着，讓雨來洗掉我心中的氣悶吧！忽然，黑得漆一樣的手伸到我的眼前，我被它一驚，抬超頭來一看，原來是一個穿着汚穢不堪的靑布工裝的摸二十歲左右的工人，臉黑得像「黑人牙膏」的商標一樣，背上背着相當沉重的鐵塊，在向着我要傳單。</p>
<p>「先生，對不起，給我一張」。</p>
<p>「行…路…時…必……必定在街……鉛上」，我給了他一張以後，他立停着低聲的一個字一個字的念着。</p>
<p>「你不十分識字嗎？」我聽得他念「沿」字爲「鉛」字，所以發着問。</p>
<p>「是，我沒有進過學堂，唉……」</p>
<p>「我念給你聽，」我自吿奮勇地將傳單上所有的字都念給他聽。</p>
<p>「謝謝你，你們眞…太好了，你們都是少爺，還在這樣的下雨天爲社會服務着，可惜我不識字，不能……哎！我應該去了，我帶這張紙給我的朋友們去看好嗎？」他感激地這樣斷斷續　地說了一大套。</p>
<p>我又呆住了，及等錕君喊我的時候，我才發現這位忠誠的朋友走了。</p>
<p>雖然，祇有五六分鐘的談話，但是我已從這位朋友身上得到極大的安慰，我知道他的句句話是從他的純潔的心裏發出來的，我是被他感動了！方才的「三千丈」的火早消退了。</p>
<p>時候已到了，我戀戀地離開了崗位——因爲在那裏給過我莫大的安慰——在毛毛雨中，回到了家。</p>
<h3>原野</h3>
<p>— 麥桿作</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第十一章　趙伯雄的供詞</p>
<p>我就乘空表示我的意見。「這個老頭兒在表面上很像一個道學先生，想不到竟會施展出這種狠毒的手段。」</p>
<p>霍桑張開了眼睛向我瞧瞧，感喟似地說：「這無疑地是金錢的魔力引誘了他。不過他也祇是個假道學，他的修養，一定還不充分。吾則，孟老夫子設過的；「富貴不能淫」，這區區的鎭鐲和戒指耳環，決不能就迷住他的心竅。我和他接談時，也給他的假面具所蒙蔽，相信他是一個舊式的君子人，因此他在行兇時因時間忽促而遺留在書桌邊上的那枚假象牙烟嘴，竟也相信他眞是在晚飯後閱報時遺留的。包郞，這是我的失著，我竟受了他的騙。其實我從那枚香烟嘴上測度他的個性，除了紙烟吸到盡根表示他過度節儉以外？烟嘴的保持完整，又顯見他是個細心謹愼的人。可是他在談話終了走出客室時，又故意忘掉那枚烟嘴，又顯不他是個粗心健忘的人。這舉動明明和我先前的推斷完全相反，我當時竟不曾立卽想到，可見我的腦子的靈敏性，確是跟着年齡而逐漸裝退了！」他連帶著嘆息了一聲。</p>
<p>我道：「這也難怪你。他的矯飾工夫的確很高明，醫如據金梅說，他在發案後首先主張報吿警署；他對於王麗蘭的生平又好像表示伊有些自作自受，對於伊的死叉像莫名究竟，又不自謀卸罪地舉出其他嫌疑人。總之他的行動，態度，言語，的確都不易敎人生疑」。</p>
<p>霍桑搖頭道：「不，他在談話之間，好像他是很淸高的，不滿意麗蘭的行爲。其實我後來仔細一想，他的淸高也出於虛偽。你想他在前年秋天來過一次，卽然不滿意麗蘭的生活行動，又認爲上海是個惡濁的都市，那末，他這一决爲什麼再來？而且叉爲什麼仍舊寄住在他所不滿的內姪女的屋子裏？」</p>
<p>我點點頭。「那末，他在實際行刺的動作方面，你有過怎樣的假定」？</p>
<p>霍桑道：「他的行動的步驟，我想你等一回可以聽他自己說，用不着我間接地說明，因爲我說起來多少會有些隔膜。不過我的限光所以集中到他身上，然後又斷定是他，關鍵還在那個甲印上。我想起我曾瞧見客室中有一雙陸健笙留着的拖鞋，因此料想也許還有一變皮鞋留在屋子裏，給李芝範　用。剛才我單獨到警廳裹去時，叫你先到麗蘭家去找李芝範談話，我的目的就要你設法覊留他在樓下，以便我可以悄悄地到他房間裏去搜索陸健笙的那雙黑皮鞋。後來你也瞧見的，我在麗蘭房裏果眞搜出了那雙皮鞋，你又告訴我李守琦强姦不遂的事，我的理想便完全證實了。　（一七四）</p>

<h3>偉大的我</h3>
<p>— 竺迅</p>
<p>灶如田野，我，是無數禾麥中的一粒渺小的種苗，但我亦必好好地生長，冒苗茁壯，帶着滿身的穀子。粒粒都苞含着充足的營養份。</p>
<p>比如樹林，我，是萬果長林中的一棵矮小的樹株，但我亦必須堅挺地成長，不怕風雨，不畏寒霜，枝葉扶疏地堅强美質，令人有休憇的佳蔭。</p>
<p>比如洪海，我，是大海洋中間的滴，雖然是極微渺的一滴，但是我亦知道一切波浪的起伏，潮流的來往，我亦應該處處顯出我一份子的力量，以表示大　中生命的姿態，復仇憤恨的怒潮在湃奔！</p>
<p>比如螻蟻，我，是小動物蟻羣中的一個，但是爲了自由，爲了解放，我要爬過萬里長城，爬上長白山頭，去斬斷那奴隸的鐵銬，步上血跡的徑途，來保衛祖國的河山！</p>
<h3>貧窮</h3>
<p>— 逢渠</p>
<p>貧窮是可怕的；有時貧窮能够毀滅靈魂；不過凜冽的北風鞭策吾人，而溫煖的南風，却使吾人頹然地睡去。－烏依德</p>
<p>貧窮並不是過失。－法諺</p>
<p>世界上的許我大人物，都曾度過貧苦的生活。－塞斯洛</p>
<p>可以與奮吾人能力與發達吾人精神的東西，更沒有比有計劃的志願與相當的貧困的壓迫，兩者所結合起來的力量，更爲透澈更爲有效的了。－克里夫蘭</p>

<p>㳺藝界</p>
<h3>電影皇后—蓓蒂黛維絲</h3>
<p>— 淸暉</p>
<p>當選好萊塢本年度雷影皇后的蓓蒂黛維絲，她不是一個演員，一個明星，而是一位天才的女藝人，她以精湛的演技，去換得這崇高的榮譽，無論何種角色，給她飾演起來，沒有不淋漓盡致，刻劃入微；而且又出落得沉魚落雁，閉月羞花，笑的時候，像朶迎風芙蓉；哭的時候，又似帶雨海棠，用花來形容她，是再切合沒有了。閒話少叙，言歸正傳：</p>
<p>半工半讀</p>
<p>在一九零八年四月五日，她母親旅行到羅威爾地方，因爲勞動過度，產生下一個不足十月的女孩子，她就是蓓蒂。在她出世小久，她的雙親就宣吿離婚，蓓蒂依着母親過活。可憐的她，幼年多病，把快樂的少女時代在慘苦中度過了。後來爲了家庭的貧苦，不得已而在校服役，以供學費，日作夜讀，這樣才完成她的學業，</p>
<p>兩度獲獎</p>
<p>當然，她並不以苦工爲異，然而她希望在百老匯或好萊塢尋求出路，終於費了一年辛苦被安排在一部片子裏，充了配角，但結果是失敗了，這部片子幾乎把她　閉在影界門外。可是她自信甚堅，終於在「女人女人」一片中充任主角，一　而榮獲金像尖，一九三八年叉以「紅衫淚痕」再度獲獎。目前在滬公映「再生緣」又是她的成功之作，看來本年度的金像獎，還是以她這一位影后最有希望。</p>
<p>愛好詩歌</p>
<p>在私生活裏，蓓蒂對於詩歌有着非常的愛好，不但喜歡讀，而且常常提起筆來寫，不但寫，而且常常拿到雜誌上去發表，「愛瑙麥絲」便是她底化名。浪漫是詩人的風度，可是這位女詩人，不，相反地她工作非常認眞，比一般女工還要認眞。早晨八時到公司，入晚八時才返家，有誰能像她在工作塲上躭擱得這麼久呢？所以許多人奇怪她爲什麽要那樣勞苦，有時她自己也要詫異起來，可是習慣依然不改。在她的生命中最寡歡的一件事，　是沒有事做，一天到晚只是尋找歡樂的時期。</p>
<p>崇拜中國</p>
<p>你也許要驚奇吧。蓓蒂黛維絲是一個崇我中或的女星，她曾給這樣讀美過：「從小，我就知道在遠東有這麽一個强大無敵的中國，它蘊藏着無量數的礦物原料，有聳立的高由，縈帶的江河，可是那裹的民族並不依靠高山深川作天然屏障，膏腴　澤爲生命淵源，他們賴於堅苦忍耐的卓絕精神，現正在和侵略者作自衛的鬥爭，以求永久光榮的和平，那來我們可以知道中國是如何的偉大與光明了。」</p>
<h3>張君秋毛世來喜訊</h3>
<p>— 喜鵲</p>
<p>先後結婚——相距十日</p>
<p>故都伶界，最近有兩大喜事，便是四小名旦中的兩小名旦——張君秋·毛世來，都是做新郞了！張君秋娶的是趙硯奎之女，定今日（二十三在福壽堂結婚；君秋最近應天津中國大戲院的邀請，前往演唱，直到婚前五大纔趕西北平。毛世來的未婚妻，是劉斌升的義妹，也姓劉，則定於十二月三日舉行婚禮，地點在萃華樓。張君秋自天津回平後，現在毛世來糶君秋之後，又上天津去了，也是應中國犬戲院之邀，而且也決定在婚前的五天趕回北平，這已經是巧事，而兩家的結婚地點：福壽堂與萃華樓，又同在東城，相距僅數十武之遙，這又是一個巧事。此外兩家的婚儀，都　用舊式旗傘羅蓋，花轎向由恒泰喜轎舖承辦，這更是巧之又巧了。（十一月十八日自北平寄）</p>

<h3>Chongqing Allocates Funds for New Air Raid Shelters</h3>
<p>To better protect residents during air raids, the Chongqing government has allocated 500,000 yuan for the construction of new air raid shelters. Currently, Chongqing has 1,189 air raid shelters, accommodating 368,195 people. According to the latest population survey, the city's population, excluding the suburbs, is 353,188. This year, Japan may use five times the number of aircraft for bombing compared to last year. However, the number of casualties this year is only two-thirds of last year's figure. The Chongqing Air Defense Auxiliary Team currently has over 10,000 people, mostly civilian volunteers. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Japan Intensifies Preparations for Southern Advance; Long Yun Discusses Sino-Japanese War Situation; Japan Recognizes Military Conquest of China as Impossible; Threat to Burma Road Will Not Impede Transportation</h3>
<p>Kunming - Yunnan Provincial Chairman General Long Yun, in an exclusive interview with the Associated Press today, stated that Japan is preparing to seize resource-rich but poorly defended countries such as Vietnam, Thailand, and Burma. Chairman Long predicts that China will continue to fight, and the war will end through diplomatic rather than military means. Chairman Long highly praised the United States' economic measures against Japan but felt that the economic measures adopted by the United States were not aggressive enough. However, neither the United States nor Japan desires war. General Long, who has governed Yunnan for twelve years, received the reporter at his headquarters, located on the site of a 17th-century Ming Dynasty empress's residence. The reporter was surprised by Long's simple attire and gentle demeanor upon entering Long's personal reception room. Long's appearance and demeanor were those of a typical scholar, not a rough military man. His words and actions were characterized by the gentleness of an artist, the precision of a scientist, the alertness of a military strategist, and the wisdom of a philosopher. Although Long is middle-aged, he is physically fit and appears to be in his thirties. He showed great interest in discussing the international situation and continued to tell the reporter, "After three years of fighting in China, Japan has realized the obvious fact that it is impossible to conquer China by force. Japan is now regretting the endless and unprofitable war in China and is attempting a southern advance with diplomatic and strategic schemes to gain benefits without spending money or manpower. Tokyo's current scheme to disturb the eastern corner of Asia is to incite war between Thailand and Vietnam to profit from it." In the center of the black paneled wall of Long's reception room hangs a photo of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Long taken in 1935 when Chairman Chiang visited Yunnan. Long, a cigar smoker, after lighting a cigar with a match, told the reporter, "The Japanese are now planning Burma to seize Burma's oil fields and rice paddies on the one hand and cut off our country's international transportation on the other, achieving two goals with one arrow. As for the threat posed by the Japanese bombing of bridges on the Burma Road, the actual experience last month has proven that this threat is impossible. Even if most of the cables of the bridges on the Burma Road are cut off, leaving only one, we can still transport goods back and forth on it. Our transportation will not be hindered by this. The Japanese may now even be planning to overthrow Thailand and use the pretext of passing through that country. I believe that the Japanese will not dare to attack the Dutch East Indies or Singapore rashly before occupying Vietnam, Thailand, and Burma." When the reporter inquired about the rumored Japanese intentions toward Saigon, Chairman Long replied that the Japanese troops concentrated on Hainan Island could land in Saigon at any time and predicted that the French would not resist once the Japanese troops landed in Saigon. Regarding US-Japan relations, Chairman Long said that the various actions taken by the United States in recent years are admirable, "But I believe that a US-Japan war will not happen in the near future. Japan is very cautious towards the United States and is trying its best to avoid actual war with the United States. And the United States is unwilling to engage in military action without serious consideration beforehand. The economic means of the United States may be sufficient to cause difficulties for Japan, but Washington has not fully implemented what it should in its economic sanctions." Chairman Long also said that Yunnan Province has a very rich harvest this year, and food is guaranteed to be sufficient. Chairman Long often goes to investigate the bombed areas after each air raid in Yunnan and personally supervises the preparations. Fire prevention preparations to deal with incendiary bombs have now been completed. Chairman Long predicts that the Chinese people will continue to fight, and the Sino-Japanese war "can only end when the Japanese realize that China cannot be conquered by force. I believe that this war will not end with military force but with diplomatic means." (Associated Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Being Transferred to South China</p>
<p>Chongqing - Yesterday, when entertaining the press here, the Chinese military spokesman said that Japan's preparations for the southern advance can be seen from the large number of Japanese troops being transferred from Vietnam to the Zhongshan area near Macau. The First Imperial Guard Division, formerly stationed in Shandong, has also been transferred to South China. It is expected that these troops will soon join the two divisions currently concentrated on Hainan Island. In the past week, due to the relocation of Japanese vehicles, there have only been minor contacts on various front lines. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing - When the military spokesman here entertained news reporters this afternoon, he mentioned the movements of Japanese troops in China, saying that according to unverified news, some of the Japanese troops stationed in Shandong and the Northeast have recently been withdrawn. Recently, a new Japanese division has arrived in Central China, and there are also signs of a large number of Japanese troops arriving in the Zhongshan area near Guangzhou, a large part of which was recently withdrawn from Vietnam. The spokesman estimated that there are currently a total of one division of Japanese troops stationed in Vietnam. A reporter asked whether the Japanese army would try to cross the Yellow River this winter. The spokesman replied that the Japanese army is now concentrating its efforts on expanding southwest, so it may not try to attack the northwest. Although there are several places on the Yellow River where the ice freezes three feet thick in winter, the Japanese army and its equipment can advance on the ice, but the Japanese army may not make this attempt, partly because the important crossing points near Luoyang are still in the hands of the Chinese army, and partly because the Chinese army has made sufficient preparations to deal with this attempt. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Japan to Launch Guangdong-Jiangxi Offensive</p>
<p>Hong Kong - If the Japanese army launches another attack on Shaoguan, the wartime capital of Guangdong Province, the senior Guangdong military officers now in Nanning are ready to fight in Guangdong Province. Upon hearing the news that 10,000 Japanese soldiers are heading to Guangdong, their desire to return to Guangdong arose spontaneously. According to an unconfirmed report, among the Japanese detachments coming to Guangdong, there are elite guard troops who participated in the Battle of Kunlun Pass northeast of Nanning last winter and have rich experience. They come directly from Japan and represent the elite of the Japanese army. The Chinese military authorities believe that if the Japanese decide to advance northward again, they will attack Wengyuan from Zengcheng north of the East River, or attack north from Xinshi on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, or from Lulong (transliteration) in the Shantou area to the East River (where there is a highway to Shaoguan). However, the Japanese may not take the last mentioned route, as the Japanese army in Shantou is currently taking a defensive posture. Chinese military reports say that 10,000 Japanese troops have arrived in Guangzhou, some of whom will be stationed in Baoan, and 6,000 can be used in the Guangzhou and West River areas. Although the Japanese guards are not really ill, they need a major rest due to the unsuitable weather in the Nanning area. It is said that the Chinese headquarters in Shaoguan has received orders from the central military authorities in China not to take a defensive posture but to adopt a "strategic offensive" in Guangxi to try to make the Japanese army withdraw from Nanning. The plan for this strategic offensive, planned by the Guangdong generals in Guangxi, has been transmitted from Guilin to here today. The new commander-in-chief of the Japanese army in Guangzhou is also expected to launch a new offensive in Guangdong to increase his military reputation, but the Japanese army in Vietnam is not under his command.

<p>French Deny Thai-Vietnamese Conflict</p>
<p>Vichy - Regarding the situation in French Indochina, there are many rumors from foreign sources that a separatist movement has occurred in the colony of Cochinchina, causing considerable anxiety to the French authorities. It is said that the Governor-General of Vietnam, Lieutenant General Decoux, has resigned, and even that Vietnamese and Thai troops have clashed on the Mekong River border. The official here has repeatedly denied this, dismissing it as completely unfounded, and stating that the US State Department denied on the 18th of this month the rumor that Britain and the United States supported Thailand's territorial claims against Vietnam. (Havas News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>Vichy - French officials here said that rumors of war between Vietnamese and Thai troops are completely unfounded. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo - When the Foreign Ministry spokesman entertained news reporters today, he was asked about the border conflict between Thai and Vietnamese troops. The spokesman replied that the government had not received official information to verify the news reports. When a reporter asked for his opinion on the Hong Kong newspaper report about China blocking the Yunnan-Vietnam border, the spokesman answered irrelevantly, saying, "This is good," and added that the news from Hong Kong had not received official verification but that if it was true, it would be very comforting, as the Japanese army entered Vietnam to cut off the supply line between Chongqing and Vietnam. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Japan Claims Increased Friendship with Vietnam</p>
<p>Hanoi - The Japanese side here declared today that the friendly relations between Vietnam and Japan are increasing, while anti-Japanese activities on the American side here are increasing daily. The Japanese side also said that it is rumored that an American enterprise company has refused to provide its warehouses outside Hanoi to the Japanese army for storing fuel. Japanese military officials and the Vietnamese authorities are very angry about this. The side also said that the American enterprise company's refusal was instigated by the American consul. It is said that the fuel was transported to Hanoi under the French-Japanese agreement. According to the Japanese, the Vietnamese authorities are now continuing to transport oil to Hanoi regardless of the company's existence, because the company, which is a [sic - word missing] enterprise, is obviously American property. When the Japanese army entered Vietnam, they suddenly changed to American nationality. (Associated Press, 22nd)</p>
<h3>986 Japanese Aircraft Destroyed in China; Chinese Air Force Strength Improved; Hope to Obtain Fighter Planes from US</h3>
<p>Chongqing - According to an official announcement today, a total of 986 Japanese aircraft have been destroyed in the past forty months of the Sino-Japanese War, of which 308 were shot down by Chinese aircraft, 236 were destroyed on the ground, and 164 were shot down by anti-aircraft guns. The Japanese aircraft damaged and crashed behind the Chinese military front were not included. According to official estimates, since the beginning of the war, the foreign property lost due to Japanese air raids is the largest for Britain, totaling 1,949,465 yuan, followed by the United States, with 1,468,809 yuan, then Italy with 744,870 yuan, Germany with 150,000 yuan, Spain with 30,000 yuan, France with 17,500 yuan, and Sweden with 3,000 yuan. According to a spokesman for the Chinese Air Force, the above figures do not include property losses of foreign governments and institutions, but only private losses of foreign nationals in China. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing - A military spokesman pointed out that the main shortcoming of the current Chinese military offensive is the lack of aircraft, saying that if China can obtain 500 aircraft from the United States, the Chinese military can immediately begin a general offensive. According to military experts, Japan's air force strength totals 3,000 aircraft, of which 1,100 are used in China and 400 are stationed in Manchuria. However, since a large number of aircraft were recently withdrawn from China for possible southern advances and national defense, approximately 600 aircraft are currently fighting in China. China now has bomber squadrons, but due to the lack of fighter protection, they cannot be used. If 500 fighter planes can be obtained from the United States, the skies can be controlled, and the Chinese military can take the initiative in land warfare. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<h3>New Fourth Army's Troop Transfer Not Yet Implemented</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Regarding the news that the Chinese New Fourth Army will be transferred from the Central China region to a certain province in North China, according to a responsible person from the Kuomintang, the detailed report on the troop transfer has not yet been received here, and it will generally take some time before it can be implemented.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Telephone Rate Increase</h3>
<p>Recently, it has been rumored that the Shanghai Telephone Company will increase its rates. The rumor has been circulating for a long time and once stimulated the price of telephone stocks, causing them to rise, but they later returned to dormancy, mainly because it was under consideration by the Municipal Council. A week ago, it was reported that the Municipal Council had formulated temporary measures for the telephone rate increase. There are three principles: in addition to new telephone installation deposits and increased fees for moving machines, installing branch machines, etc., the increase in users' regular contributions is substantial; one is to reduce the basic number of calls: business telephones are reduced from 150 calls to 100 calls, and residential telephones are reduced from 100 calls to 85 calls; in terms of percentages, the rights of users to make calls are reduced by 30%; in addition, the monthly rental fee is increased by 30%; plus the call fee beyond the basic number of calls; each time from 3 cents increased to 7 cents, the increase is 133%. Assuming a business telephone makes 300 calls per month, according to the old rules, in addition to the monthly rental of 10 yuan, the excess of 150 calls is charged at 3 cents per call, totaling 4 yuan and 5 cents. The total is 14 yuan and 5 cents. According to the new rules, the monthly rental is 10 yuan, with 100 calls, plus an additional fee of 30%, totaling 13 yuan, and the excess of 200 calls is charged at 7 cents per call, totaling 14 yuan, the total is 27 yuan. The average number of calls for business telephones exceeds the average, although no statistics are available, it is safe to say that it is more than 200 times; even according to 200 calls, the monthly increase in expenses for users has reached 86%. However, if the number of calls exceeds more, the increase rate is greater. In short, it is no exaggeration to say that today's telephone rate increase is more than 100% compared to the original. Those who oppose it say that the development of telephones in Shanghai is purely due to the increase in users in the concessions, and it is unwise to increase their burden now. Some also say that the large increase in the number, once implemented, will not only have a negative impact on industry and commerce, but most residents will be unable to bear the burden. Therefore, it is believed that although the municipal authorities of the two concessions have recently approved it, users generally hope that the authorities will seriously review the income and expenditure of the telephone company again; if the price increase is inevitable, the percentage of the price increase should also be reduced. This is the opinion of users reported in the newspapers, which is also the reaction caused by the temporary measures for the price increase.</p>
<p>I believe that public utilities are originally intended to facilitate public use, aiming to allow the public to obtain the greatest enjoyment at the lowest cost. Therefore, the municipal authorities treat public utilities with special preferential treatment, allowing them to operate monopolistically, so as to protect their due interests, and also to make them serve the public faithfully. Because of this, it is better for such undertakings to be run by the city. However, because the spirit of official management is often not as good as that of commercial management, there are many cases of public utilities returning to commercial management from municipal management. Having returned to commercial management, businessmen naturally treat them the same as general profit-making enterprises, calculating every ounce of profit from their capital; once the profits cannot meet their expectations, they will inevitably raise prices regardless of the burden, in order to compensate for what they want; thus, they are nominally public utilities but in reality no different from private enterprises, which is also an inevitable harm of commercial management, and the citizens suffer the consequences.</p>
<p>Electricity, heat, and power have increased in price; public buses and trams have increased in price; tap water and gas have also increased in price; even if the telephone company has no need to increase prices, can it not be moved and think of emulating it? Moreover, at a time when prices are high, there is no shortage of excuses to raise prices, so the telephone company's decision to increase prices cannot be solely blamed. Even if the municipal authorities have allowed various public utilities to increase prices first, it is not fair to deny the telephone company from following suit. Thus, since the price increase is a universal fact; the only thing in contention is the degree of the price increase. The telephone rate increase has been under consideration for several months, and the permission to increase it in this way must have its reasons for increasing it, and it is certainly not comparable to a rashly granted request. However, what should be noted is that public utilities should not increase the burden on the public because of the general increase in prices, thinking that the prices obtained by public utilities are too low; nor should they be greedy for the windfall profits of private businesses and be unwilling for public utilities to have a sigh of regret. All of this, I know, the municipal authorities will never have this idea: but can those who operate public utilities guarantee that they will not have this idea? The company relies on its documents for consideration, so the reasons for the application must be justified, and the proof provided must be thorough and without omissions. Moreover, under the management of foreign merchants, the concept of currency value is very important. In the case of undertakings invested and operated in China, they are still calculated in foreign exchange everywhere, so when foreign exchange is short, the price will increase accordingly. However, it is known that when foreign exchange increased greatly during the First European War, no public utility was heard of reducing prices at that time.</p>
<p>Today, the Municipal Council reviews the rate increase event of public utilities, which is closely related to the welfare of citizens. It must first consider the interests of citizens, and then consider the interests of the undertakings. However, public utilities want to increase the burden on the public, they should also let the public know the burden that should be increased, and the reason why the burden comes from the servants, but today, those who increase the burden on the public only know the consequences of this burden, but do not know the factual reasons for this burden. How can this make the public happy to bear the burden without complaint!</p>
<p>Some say that the facts of the price increase may involve secrets in its operation, so there is no reason to make it public, so are the reasons for the price increase all that cannot be told to people? This is how we know it is not, because the position of public utilities is different from that of general industries and businesses, so its actions should give the public the opportunity to see and hear them.</p>
<h3>Change of Command Flagship for US Asiatic Fleet; Another Batch of US Aircraft Transported to Philippine Islands to Increase Defense</h3>
<p>Manila - The USS Houston today became the flagship of the US Asiatic Fleet, which is the second time in history. Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet, transferred from the USS Augusta to the USS Houston at 9:00 a.m. after a ceremony. The USS Augusta will soon sail back to the United States. Today's ceremony completed the [ship's] seven years of service in the Asiatic Fleet. It is said that the ship replaced the USS Houston as the flagship on November 14, 1933. (Associated Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>Honolulu - News today said that some US Army aviators and aircraft have been transported to the Philippines on a transport ship from the Department of the Army. The transport ship, the Etolin, arrived here on Wednesday evening and left here at midnight for Manila.

<h3>US Far East Policy Strengthens; Matsuoka Diplomacy Fails; Nomura Delays Trip to Tokyo, US-Japan Talks Stalled; US Reporter Observes Japan Unable to Wage War in Pacific</h3>
<p>Tokyo - When the Foreign Ministry entertained news reporters today, it was asked whether the government had received news from Washington indicating that the United States had changed its attitude towards the Far East, in particular towards Japan. The spokesman replied, "No." A US reporter said that US Ambassador Grew had held multiple talks with Japanese authorities some days ago, including two talks with Foreign Minister Matsuoka and one with the Vice-Minister. There has been no contact between the two sides since then. He asked what the nature of the multiple talks was and why there had been no contact in recent days. The spokesman declined to disclose the nature of the talks and said that the fact that the diplomatic representative had not visited the Foreign Minister of the host country was enough to indicate that there were no important questions pending discussion between the two countries. He was also asked why the formal announcement of Nomura's appointment as ambassador to the United States had been delayed. The spokesman replied that this was because the necessary formalities for the formal announcement had not yet been completed. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Honolulu - Frederick Moore, the former owner of the Japan Advertiser, who passed through here on a Japanese ship yesterday en route to the United States, said that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka would never start a war with the United States. Matsuoka had told him that the purpose of Japan's treaty with the Axis powers was to restrain the United States and prevent it from taking [militarily] aggressive action in the Pacific. Moore also said that he believed there would be no US-Japan war in the Pacific, but that this plan was unwelcome in the eyes of the big navy faction who advocated expanding the navy. If the United States gets involved in the European war, Japan will follow the Three-Power Pact and take action. People of normal psychology in both the United States and Japan do not want war. If the United States joins the war, it will be the end of world civilization. If the United States remains neutral, it can save world civilization. Japan's southern advance policy is only economic in nature and not military in nature. Japan only wants to gain economic control in the Dutch East Indies and does not want to use force. Japan has not yet planned to seize the Dutch East Indies with its navy. However, so far, Japan's economic wishes in the Dutch East Indies, such as gasoline, have not been markedly successful. Moore also said that although Nomura had not been formally appointed as ambassador to the United States, he himself was reluctant to accept the position. Moore also said that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke is now continuing to urge Nomura to accept the position. (Associated Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Kokumin Shimbun today wrote an editorial urging Prime Minister Konoe to beware of pro-American and status quo factions within the country. The Kokumin Shimbun said that elements in Japan's political and economic circles are now in possession of powerful potential, advocating that the Japanese government maintain the status quo. The newspaper also said that Japan's international path, after the establishment of the Three-Power Alliance, has made friction with Britain and the United States unavoidable. The newspaper also said that the Konoe Cabinet should take on the arduous responsibility of leading Japan through the international crisis and establishing a "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." The newspaper pointed out that factions advocating maintaining the status quo are now regaining power in the political and economic spheres. The newspaper added, "Regarding this matter, the most unforgivable are the pro-American elements among them." (Associated Press, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Nazi Espionage in America: US Investigative Committee Releases Report, Important Documents Seized Exposing Secrets</h3>
<p>WASHINGTON - The Congressional "Committee to Investigate Anti-American Activities," also known as the "Dies Committee," yesterday ordered the search of documents belonging to pro-Japanese, pro-Nazi, pro-Fascist, and pro-Communist groups in eight major cities. These eight cities are Baltimore, Buffalo, Boston, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, New Orleans, Milwaukee, and Denver. Simultaneously, the committee released a report, compiled based on documents seized from German commercial firms and the Transocean News Service in New York. One section specifically exposes the relationship between Japanese diplomats in the United States and the Transocean News Service. The original text states that the Transocean News Service not only offered advice to Japanese diplomats but also informed the German government on how to deal with American affairs. The committee claims to have documents proving that "The Transocean News Service is the main propaganda organ of the Nazi Party in Guatemala, Mexico, Cuba, Ecuador, Argentina, and Brazil. Materials sent from Germany to various countries in the Americas are vehemently anti-American, and the Transocean News Service distributes them to local newspapers without charge." The committee also obtained evidence that Chipura (president of the Transocean News Service in the United States) paid close attention to the United States' handling of diplomatic relations with Japan, sometimes offering suggestions not only to the Japanese ambassador but also reporting to his own government on what steps should be taken to be advantageous. One telegram to Berlin stated, "The strongest and only way to ensure America's neutrality is to cause complications in US-Japan diplomatic relations. This way, America will not be able to get involved in European affairs for a certain period of time in the present and future." Currently, the US State Department seems to be trying to clear up the Far East situation so that it can have more strength to focus on Europe. In recent weeks, both official and unofficial anti-German propaganda in the United States has increased. If this continues to increase, the impact on public psychology will be significant, creating a preliminary stage for the United States to abandon its formal neutrality." (22nd United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>NEW YORK - The American "Wireless Telegraph Communications Agency" declares that the white paper released by the Congressional Dies Committee after investigating anti-American activities mentions that a certain employee of the New York branch of the Transocean News Service is an employee of the "Wireless Telegraph Communications Agency," which is not true. Quisenberry (surname) Assel (given name) of the Transocean News Service is not related to Quisenberry (surname, different character) (given name) of the "Wireless Telegraph Communications Agency."

<h3>Evacuated British Women Unlikely to Return to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>HONG KONG - According to a public statement released here today, the Colonial Office believes that the situation in the Far East is unlikely to improve in the short term, making it impossible for the dependents of British expatriates who have already been evacuated to return to Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government recently received successive petitions from British women who had been evacuated and their husbands remaining in Hong Kong, requesting permission for those who had left Hong Kong to return. Therefore, it specifically sought instructions from the home government, and the reply was received by telegram and issued as a public statement. (22nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>American Missionary Arrested in Japan</h3>
<p>HONOLULU - It was learned here yesterday that Ms. Lawrence, an American church missionary who had served in Seoul, Korea, for twenty years, was arrested by Japanese police in Yokohama yesterday while on a ship returning to the United States. According to the police, the reason for the arrest is unknown, but they stated that they were merely carrying out the authorities' orders. According to passengers on the ship, US Ambassador to Japan Grew was at the pier saying goodbye to friends when he heard the news and promised to do his best to help. There were 160 church members on board the ship returning to the United States, all of whom believe that Ms. Lawrence herself had no reason to warrant the arrest. It is believed that Ms. Lawrence's sudden arrest is the first time in years that an American church member has been detained in Japan. (22nd United Press dispatch)</p>

<h3>After Eleven Days of Fierce Fighting, Greek Troops Seize Korçë, Italian Side Admits Korçë Has Fallen, All Italian Troops Retreat Northwest</h3>
<p>LONDON - Korçë, specially selected and meticulously arranged by the Italian side as a base for attacking Greece, has now fallen into the hands of the Greek army. According to recent reports, the elite Italian troops are now retreating in disarray before the pursuing Greek troops. Currently, the front lines in the Pindus region are all within Albanian territory. The resistance of the Italian troops in the coastal Epirus region seems to be collapsing continuously. Military figures here, while praising the glorious victory of the Greek army in defeating a larger force with a smaller one, believe it is a mistake to consider the current Italian defeat as a complete rout or to believe that a large number of Italian troops will be cut off. The Italian air force has been much less active in the past few days, possibly due to the unexpected resistance from the Greek and British air forces. Military supplies of all kinds, along with armaments and munitions seized by British forces from Italian bases in the Western Egyptian desert are being rushed into Greece and used by Greek forces to bombard Italian forces. (22nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>ROME - The Italian General Headquarters has just announced that after eleven days of fierce fighting and suffering heavy casualties, the Italian army has withdrawn from the positions around Korçë and the city of Korçë. The Italian army has now retreated west of Korçë. Italian reinforcements have concentrated in new positions. (22nd United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>ROME - According to the Italian military command, two Italian divisions have retreated from the vicinity of Korçë to a new defensive line to the west, ending eleven days of intense fighting. (22nd Transocean News Service dispatch)</p>
<p>SOUTHERN CAPITAL CITY - A report from Monastir states that after a protracted and fierce battle, the first patrol of Greek troops rushed into the city of Korçë yesterday morning. Last night, the main force of the Greek army had completely occupied the city. (22nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>ATHENS - The Italian army has abandoned the city of Korçë, and the Greek army is preparing to occupy it. Its vanguard has reached the eastern suburbs of Korçë, temporarily stopping to wait for the main force to descend directly from the eastern slope of the Morava Mountains to take the city together. The Greek army has cut off the road south of Korçë leading to Oskaca and is now sweeping the enemy in the rural areas west of Korçë. The Italian artillery is currently covering the Italian army's retreat along the road to Pogradec, while Korçë is still within range of Italian artillery fire. (22nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>ATHENS - According to a communiqué from the General Headquarters here, the Greek army continued to achieve victories yesterday, capturing seven heavy artillery pieces, four anti-aircraft guns, dozens of machine guns, many mortars, and countless military supplies. In addition, they also occupied food and oil depots. Greek aircraft scouted and bombed the battlefield, with great success. (22nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>ATHENS - It is reported that the Italian troops on the front line are in confusion and retreating along the entire front. According to the latest military intelligence, the Italian strongholds are in danger of being surrounded, not only Korçë, but also Argirokastro. If the Greek army succeeds in flanking east of Argirokastro, it can cut off the communication between this important Italian base and eastern Albania, putting the Italian positions along the coast of Epirus in a precarious situation. Threatened by this new encirclement, the Italian army is now retreating north. Greek observation posts overlooking Korçë see long columns of Italian troops moving out of the city and heading north along the road to Pogradec. This indicates a general retreat of the Italian troops from Korçë. The Greek troops are now advancing victoriously, pursuing the Italian troops who are retreating in disarray along the misty mountain ridges in Albania. The Greek side is now making every effort to completely collapse the Italian troops currently retreating. British and Greek aircraft are constantly patrolling and bombing Italian airfields in Albania on a large scale. At the same time, due to weather conditions, the Italian army seems to have lost its air support. Previously, Italian aircraft had indeed curbed the rapid advance of the Greek army.</p>
<p>SOUTHERN CAPITAL CITY - According to news from the Greek border town here, artillery battles between Italian and Greek forces continued incessantly for the past two days. The Greek air force bombed the Argirokastro Lot airfield, while the Italian air force also bombed western Macedonia. (22nd Transocean dispatch)</p>
<p>ROME - A large number of Italian aircraft are now continuously attacking the entire position of the Arria Sea-Flores. The transportation routes, artillery positions, and troop concentration points behind the Greek positions are also being bombed.

<p>ROME - According to the Italian newspaper, fifty Greek soldiers attempted to seize Gaidaro Island but were repelled by three Italian military police. The island is located near the Greek island of Samos and is defended by only a small Italian team of sailors and several military police.

<p>Greek Troops Enter the City of Korçë, Nationwide Celebration of Victory</p>
<p>ATHENS - According to sources here, a large unit of the Italian army and a large number of military supplies were captured in the battle near Korçë. The Greek army entered Korçë at noon and raised the Greek flag on the city hall. After the Italian army retreated, the municipal authorities formally invited the Greek army to take over. When the Greek army marched in, the masses broke through the cordon and cheered wildly. Currently, the news of the occupation of Korçë has spread loudly throughout every village and town in Greece. In taverns, drinkers are raising their glasses in celebration, and church bells are ringing throughout the country to celebrate. All flags are hanging in the air. The situation in Athens is particularly enthusiastic, with a large number of women kneeling and praying in churches, thanking God for the victory. Greek Prime Minister Metaxas stood on the stone steps of the Greek General Headquarters and announced the occupation of Korçë to the masses. (22nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Greek Troops Cross the Albanian Border, Cutting off Italian Supply Lines</p>
<p>ATHENS - According to reliable sources, Greek troops have crossed the Albanian border and are advancing rapidly, having cut off the main supply line of the Italian army in Quanta to Argirokastro (within Albania). Elsewhere, Greek troops are advancing towards Korçë in three routes. On the Argirokastro road, Greek troops are advancing in a large number of captured Italian tanks and motorcycles. Another unit of Spartan troops traveled day and night, crossing the Markellari Plateau and cutting off the road in the Korçë area, blocking Italian supplies. The Spartan troops have built positions there, so retreating Italian troops encountered fierce machine gun and mortar fire. An Italian prisoner of war said that when someone shouted "Our rear is cut off" in the army, the entire Italian army became greatly disturbed. The Spartans were a famous brave people of ancient Greece. The number of troops in this battle was far less than the number of Italian troops. Italian tanks and cavalry units flowed towards Korçë. The three miles of road near that place were filled with abandoned Italian trucks and two-wheeled motorcycles, and the escaping Italian troops were strafed or bombed by British and Greek aircraft. Although the Italian army set fire to the abandoned vehicles, it is reported that there were no less than two hundred complete trucks. The Greek commander used radio to solicit drivers and mechanics from all over the country to drive these spoils of war. (22nd United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>More Than Fifty Italian Generals Reportedly Dismissed by the Italian Government</p>
<p>NEW YORK - Columbia Wireless received a broadcast report from the British Broadcasting Corporation stating that after the Italian army's failed invasion of Greece in Albania, more than fifty generals of the army were dismissed by the Italian government. (22nd United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>ATHENS - According to unconfirmed reports from Belgrade, the Greek army occupied Bogradiec on the Urita River in a blitzkrieg. British and Greek aircraft dropped leaflets throughout Albania, urging the Albanians to unite with the victorious Greek army under the exiled Albanian King Zog II to resist Italy. According to reports, sixty senior Italian front-line generals have been dismissed by Mussolini. The rapidly advancing Greek troops are too far from their supply stations, so food is being dropped by British aircraft to supply them. A Greek spokesman in Athens said today that the current strategy of the Greek army is not only to occupy Albanian territory, but also to completely destroy the Italian army that invaded Greece. The spokesman also said, "Our army is advancing according to the planned full-army operational plan, with no retreat, but also not to be lured by the enemy to go deep into a certain place." According to the latest news received this afternoon, the Italian rearguard was in a state of chaos when it withdrew from Korçë. (22nd International dispatch)</p>
<p>British and Italian Air Forces Engage in a Major Battle Over Albania, British Side Achieves Important Victory</p>
<p>CAIRO - Last night, the British side stated that while several squadrons of British bombers were attacking the strategic land and sea military centers of the Italian army from the southern coast of the Red Sea to the interior of Albania, British and Italian air forces had an unprecedented large-scale group air battle in Africa. The British side achieved victory. According to a British official report here, a total of 75 aircraft participated in the air battle, with 15 British aircraft and 60 Italian fighters engaged in fierce fighting over Libya. As a result, 10 Italian aircraft were shot down. Although the number of Italian aircraft far exceeded that of British aircraft, all of the British aircraft that attacked the Italian aircraft and provoked the air battle returned safely to their bases without injury. The official report also stated that British aircraft had launched large-scale night attacks on Asab successively. The city has been engulfed by a large fire, and the flames and smoke can be seen from 80 miles away. (22nd International News Service dispatch)</p>

<h3>A Painful History of the European War (3): Three Protagonists in the French Tragedy (3): Laval's Inability to Cope</h3>
<p>This describes the third protagonist in the French tragedy, Laval, who, along with Daladier and Gamelin, is currently being held in a prison near Vichy, awaiting the Supreme Court's verdict on whether they misled the country. The original article was written by the famous French journalist, Saint Jean. From 1935 to 1937, he served as the London bureau chief for the Paris Soir newspaper. As the European situation tightened, he returned to France to work, and after the outbreak of war, he joined the French government's intelligence department. The original article appeared in Harpet's Magazine in the United States, and is now translated below:</p>
<p>France's decisive defeat can be said to be rare in ancient and modern times. Within a very short period of time, military affairs influenced the political situation, and involved many countries. It is difficult to find a similar example in the history of the world. This tragedy will undoubtedly become an important subject of study for the world in the coming years.</p>
<p>Before the invasion of the Netherlands and Belgium, the Western Front was not tense. Therefore, the decisive period of this war can be said to have begun on May 10 and ended on June 13, lasting only thirty-four days. In fact, the decisive time for both sides may have been even shorter. The breakthrough of the French Corap army's line and the disintegration of the main force occurred on May 17. Therefore, no matter how brave the French army was, no matter how sufficient the French military equipment was, it had already been defeated within these seven days.</p>
<p>Given the short time of contact between the two armies, the great pain suffered by France, various bizarre rumors arose. Some said, "France's defeat was due to internal traitors who sold the country." Others said, "A former French prime minister secretly negotiated in Switzerland last winter and betrayed France to Hitler for a few bags of money." These kinds of rumors were, of course, enough to be shocking, but the reality was not like that. The reason for France's defeat was more due to political reasons than military ones.</p>
<p>France's military failure was due to the following reasons: the air force was backward for many years; there were many French pilots who could rival the world's best, but due to insufficient aircraft production, they were still waiting for "planes" to move in the spring of this year; there were very few tanks; the French armaments factories devoted most of their efforts to manufacturing heavy artillery throughout the winter, but did not pay attention to tanks. In fact, heavy artillery was hardly used in this blitzkrieg; and the delay in air defense equipment and the weakness of the intelligence agencies were fully exposed. More importantly, the military authorities stuck to conventions and did not know how to adapt to circumstances. If we say that France had prepared in advance for the European war of 1914, it was not accurate, but at least it was much better prepared than for the European war of 1939, which is undeniable. A group of veterans who had participated in the last European war had rich experience, but their knowledge was not broad enough, and they actually overwhelmed the young officers who were planning new tactics. The cry of "remember the past" was louder than "imagine the future." The Maginot Line was a great project based on the experience of the last trench warfare, using the old to resist the new, believing that it could not only destroy modern invaders, but also sweep away all new military doctrines.</p>
<p>All these shortcomings were seen by the many officials who led France's destiny until its surrender. Prime Minister Laval had been loudly criticizing and sharply pointing out the various sins of France for many years, which made him unpopular, but once he took charge of the government, he was at a loss and unable to save the country from disaster. This strange phenomenon is an important key to understanding the French tragedy, and it is not only related to this prime minister.</p>
<p>On the day of the French army's defeat, May 17, the morale of the nation did not decline. A small victory would have been enough to further inspire them. Laval's government consistently promoted the slogan of "intensifying the war" when he formed his cabinet, and worked hard to carry it out. However, on May 17, Daladier, though disagreeing with him, remained Minister of War, and Gamelin, though distrusted by him, remained in command. Whether the war could be intensified depended on the Minister of War and the Commander-in-Chief whom the Prime Minister wanted to remove, which was truly terrible. Laval gained power by opposing the policies of his predecessor, but he failed to thoroughly eliminate them, and the old forces could still influence the government. In short, Laval only held power for eighty-seven days, and his short-lived cabinet was tragically overthrown. However, during his tenure, he retained people whom he knew to be unreliable. As the ancients said, "If you hate evil, you cannot get rid of it." That was Laval.</p>
<p>Was it that Laval himself had no opinions, so he allowed them to continue to control the war policy? Absolutely not. This prime minister had always been unconventional in his views on national affairs. He had developed a sense of self-confidence before taking office. However, the people he recruited into his cabinet were all mediocre, so it is conceivable whether the opinions they expressed were brilliant.</p>
<p>On March 21, Laval's cabinet was formed. That night, Laval said to his confidants, "I formed the cabinet too early." Hearing this sentence today is strange, because everything has proven that even if he had taken power earlier, it would still have been "too late." In fact, Laval's words had a different meaning. On March 20, the parliament held a closed-door meeting, and many members abstained from voting, showing that they only wanted to "reprimand" Daladier for his mistakes, like a schoolchild, and were unwilling to "dismiss" him immediately. Laval believed that there should be an interim cabinet, and that he should wait a little longer before taking the stage. Unexpectedly, Daladier's influence declined so quickly that it was unexpected. He only received 239 votes of confidence in the National Assembly, and 300 abstained. Knowing that it was difficult to cling to his post, he decided to resign. That afternoon, the president summoned Laval to form a cabinet.</p>
<p>Laval's friends and relatives were all overjoyed when they heard the news. However, it was not only Laval's friends who were happy, but also his political enemies were secretly pleased. The people who were attached to Daladier thought that the new prime minister was only a temporary official, and that once he resigned, Daladier could make a comeback. The members who did not vote for Daladier's confidence that day came to apologize to him and ask for forgiveness. When Laval was looking for people to prepare to form a cabinet, Daladier's political power was gradually expanding again. When Laval heard the news, he had to change his policy. He knew that things would be difficult without Daladier. Because Daladier was the leader of the Radical Party and represented the general public in France. He looked cautious and willing, spoke with a southern accent, and was eloquent, making his words pleasing to the ear, so he was easily moved by soldiers, city dwellers, and rural people.</p>
<p>Laval was the opposite. He looked like a wealthy bourgeois, was short, had a stiff attitude, spoke with a nasal twang, and had a condescending manner when he spoke, making people shy away. When Daladier inspected the Maginot Line, he wore an old soft hat and a large vest, and his appearance was very casual. When Laval went, he was dressed in grand attire and had a dignified attitude. Therefore, Daladier was often popular, while Laval was never popular.</p>
<p>Therefore, on March 21, Laval had to pull his political enemy into the cabinet and reluctantly give him the post of Minister of War; he knew that without cooperating with this man in the soft hat, there would be no way to do anything.</p>
<p>It was not easy for the new prime minister to gain the support of the majority without the backing of a party. Daladier was the leader of the Radical Socialist Party, and had a great influence. Without his support in the cabinet, or in opposition to his party, it would be impossible to give orders. In short, the parliamentary system had long lost its function. Today, it overthrows a prime minister and welcomes the successor to start anew, but tomorrow it forces the successor to retain the predecessor's legacy. In this kind of inconsistent situation, France's true democracy had long existed in name only. (To be continued)</p>

According to German senior officials, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano will not come here when Romania announces its accession to the Tripartite Pact. (Haitong Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>Bucharest: According to sources in Sofia, Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov and Foreign Minister Popov will travel to Germany next week. It is believed here that after the visit of Bulgarian dignitaries to Germany, Slovak leaders will also follow. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop recently announced that three more countries will join the German-Italian-Japanese agreement. Newspapers report that Bulgaria will issue a note to Greece in the near future to make demands. (Haitong Telegram, 22nd)</p>

<p>Budapest: Hungarian newspapers yesterday warmly welcomed Hungary's accession to the Tripartite Pact, and called the day of signing the protocol a "historical day in Hungarian politics."

<p>Hungary Strives to Maintain Friendly Relations with the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Budapest: Hungarian authorities today stated that the main purpose of Hungary's accession to the Tripartite Pact is to establish lasting peace in Europe. A semi-official report stated that Hungary's participation in the Tripartite Pact increases the country's prestige, but also increases Hungary's responsibilities. The purpose of the Tripartite Pact is to prevent the spread of war, and at the same time to build a new order in the three continents. Regarding Hungary's relations with the Soviet Union, the report stated that maintaining friendly relations with the Soviet Union is a key point of Hungarian foreign policy, and Hungary's accession to the Tripartite Pact will further consolidate this relationship. (Haitong Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>Roman Authorities Explain the Purpose of the Tripartite Pact</p>
<p>Rome: Local officials said that Hungary's accession to the Tripartite Pact is without reservation, so the full text of the pact does not need to be modified. Hungary is willing to give unlimited support to the three signatory countries of the pact in political and economic terms. Hungary's accession to the Tripartite Pact sets an example for other countries to participate in the construction of a new European order, which proves that the Tripartite Pact for reorganizing Europe is attractive. Local officials continued to explain the purpose of the Tripartite Pact as follows: (1) to limit the expansion of the war and encourage any country not to get involved in the war; (2) to ensure the victory of all countries related to the Tripartite Pact; (3) to encourage other countries to join the Tripartite Pact and work together to build a new order, so as to improve the living standards of all countries in the political and economic fields. Judging from the comments of British newspapers, Britain clearly realizes that it has suffered a new blow in prestige with Hungary's accession to the Tripartite Pact. (Haitong Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>Romania's Accession to the Alliance Has No Major Significance</p>
<p>London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that if the news recently released from the German-controlled side is realized, then Romania will follow Hungary in joining the Axis. After Romania was forced to make major sacrifices, the so-called "new order" in Southeast Europe was established. Now the Axis powers have forced Romania to join the alliance and guarantee this "new order" with Hungary. This may be regarded as unreasonable. However, Romania's accession to the Axis may not be as sensational as Hungary's. The Axis powers now have no indication of taking action against Yugoslavia or Bulgaria, and Germany has no evidence of preparing to suddenly help Italy, which is in distress. The Italian campaign against Greece has now reached a critical point, and only strong intervention by Germany can save the situation, but Germany may not have this ability. However, it cannot be said that the Axis powers will disregard Yugoslavia or Bulgaria. If Germany sends troops to Bulgaria to attack Greece, Turkey will recognize that its vital interests are threatened, and will therefore be drawn into the war. As for Germany's propaganda that the Soviet Union will deal with Turkey, there is no basis in fact, and the Turkish President recently reaffirmed the friendly nature of Soviet-Turkish relations.

<p>Still under consideration by the Soviet government. We have reason to believe that this proposal is acceptable to the Soviet Union and is awaiting its reply. We have also proposed a compromise solution to the various issues arising from the Soviet annexation of territory, and have also given appropriate consideration to the existing obligations of the British government. We have also put forward a number of broad proposals to enhance relations between the two countries and to dispel potential misunderstandings. The gist of these has been reported in the newspapers. All of these are intended to establish greater trust between the two governments in political terms. The above-mentioned proposals are still awaiting a reply, so I am unable to continue to comment on this matter at this time," said the British Foreign Secretary.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Vichy government, he said that Hitler is now using his old trick of enticement and intimidation against France. France is not occupied territory, and it is becoming more difficult because of the German deportation of the French from Lorraine. As far as we know, the French protests have had no effect. The British Foreign Secretary went on to say about Greece, that providing Greece with all possible assistance is in accordance with our responsibilities and obligations, and this is the established policy of Great Britain. The three weeks of the Greek-Italian war have proven that we had reason to admire Greece when it rejected the Italian ultimatum. The British Foreign Secretary went on to say that Mussolini claimed that the Greek-Italian war was entirely Greece's fault, but although Mussolini has been trying to tell the Italian people that things are going smoothly, the Italian people have already heard the news of the destruction of Italian warships in Taranto and have seen the shame of military failure brought about by the ambitions of their leaders. They are gradually becoming unmoved and feel that their leaders are merely parrot-like in their monotonous praise of the country. If there is a naked war of plunder in the world, it is this war waged against a weak nation. Now this small nation has shown the world its courage and spirit in defending freedom, which is more powerful than a large army, as its ancient history has already shown. In world history,</p>
<p>Greece's reputation is higher than ever today, and Italy's reputation has fallen lower than ever today. There are many absurdities and absurdities in Mussolini's words, especially the statement that the culprit of the war is Britain. His intention seems to be to say that the Italians' battle is caused by Britain. This statement must be refuted. Who should bear the responsibility for the Anglo-German war? The documents are available for review. Our conscience is clear. As for Italy, Britain or other countries have never given the Italian government the pretext that Italy will be attacked. It was Mussolini who led his people into the war a few days before the collapse of France, and it had nothing to do with others. Mussolini did this solely in the hope of a victory without labor and a quick settlement. This kind of stabbing in the back against France will forever be a pre-arranged</p>
<p>cold-blooded conspiracy. From Mussolini's argument, it can be seen that Mussolini is deeply resentful that Greece rejected his olive branch on October 28. His so-called Greek preparation to join forces with Britain to attack Italy is just a pretext. Mussolini claimed that he had obtained the consent of the German leader to directly participate in the attack on Britain. The British government must recognize that Italy's participation in the bombing of women and children is simply a show of brutality and has no reason at all, and should be given due attention. Britain is still waiting for the Italian army to attack from Libya. The number of British soldiers and weapons in Egypt has greatly increased. All important points in Egypt and Sudan are heavily guarded, so Egypt and the Near East are now increasingly confident. The British Foreign Secretary finally spoke of America's active assistance to Britain, saying that arms imports are constantly flowing in, and the American President recently stated that about 60% of the weapons made in America will be supplied to Britain.

<h3>Duisburg, a Major German Inland Port, Attacked from the Air; Transportation Network in Western Germany Heavily Damaged</h3>
<p>London: On Wednesday night and Thursday morning, British bombers heavily bombed the inland port of Duisburg-Ruhrort in Germany, causing heavy damage. Duisburg-Ruhrort is the world's largest inland port, extremely important, and the main meeting point of railways, waterways, and bridges in the entire industrial area on the right bank of the Rhine in the Ruhr area. This time, the British Air Force carried out a violent attack on the port, lasting for several hours, dropping extremely heavy bombs, which must have destroyed its important raw materials. According to the pilots' reports, there were many anti-aircraft guns concentrated at the port. The American planes flew low under the range of the artillery fire, and overlooked the target, which was clearer. They then aimed and dropped heavy bombs. The target was hit and damaged and caught fire. At the same time, British coastal bombers attacked enemy air bases in Brittany, Normandy, and Picardy in France. A Blenheim-type British plane shot down a German bomber that was apparently taking off to attack Britain when it was preparing to bomb an airfield near Artos. The British plane saw this twin-engine bomber at an altitude of 5,000 feet, with its navigation lights not turned off, and launched a head-on attack. The front and rear turrets fired together, and the enemy plane was seen to fall straight down and crash next to the airfield where it had just taken off, and caught fire. A Hudson-type plane from the British Coastal Command also attacked an oil factory in Flushing, the Netherlands, causing heavy damage. (Reuters Telegram, 22nd)</p>

In the 75 days, German planes have continuously bombed various parts of Britain, destroying its various military targets. Harbors, airfields, and armaments factories have been bombed repeatedly and none have been spared. German planes have also been able to reach the Atlantic Ocean, strengthening the blockade of the British Isles. In addition to bombing the military industrial center of the Midlands on a large scale recently, German planes have also bombed harbor facilities and military targets in Weymouth, Northampton, and Bournemouth. British planes attacked western and northern France and western German cities on the night of the 20th, and the damage suffered was insignificant. (Haitong Telegram, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Yuan Ludeng Issues Statement Regarding the Orphanage</h3>
<p>Yuan Ludeng, chairman and director of the Shanghai Orphanage, issued the following statement yesterday because a certain newspaper still had some misunderstandings about the truth: This orphanage and its colleagues have put in the utmost effort to educate and care for more than 600 orphans. Its financial difficulties have been alleviated by the continuous donations from kind people from all walks of life. Raising funds is a difficult task every day. All donations and accounts have been published in the Shen and Xin newspapers to show credibility. I and all the directors of the orphanage are fully responsible for the economic expenditures in the orphanage and can be audited at any time. As for the so-called "malfeasance" and "bribery," major newspapers are trying to cover it up, which is unfounded and unnecessary. The orphanage has its own strict position. As for the matter of rewarding reporter Jiang Shilin of the Shanghai United News Agency with 2,000 yuan, because the orphanage has held charity competitions in the past, Mr. Jiang has been running around planning, serving and promoting, and the news agency's finances have always been tight, as a demonstration of human mutual assistance, so there was the motivation to give this subsidy to help them succeed and reward their hard work. However, because the outside world has already misunderstood the orphanage, Mr. Jiang has returned the full amount to the orphanage, so it has nothing to do with the reporters of various newspapers at all. In order to prevent rumors from spreading and misunderstanding the truth, I solemnly declare again that if there are any more criticisms in the future, I am busy with affairs and it is difficult to have the time to answer them one by one.</p>
<p>Famous Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition Still Has Today and Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Jingwu Sports Association in the Cishu Building on Nanjing Road is holding an exhibition of calligraphy and paintings by more than 100 famous artists to raise funds for the Youyou Orphanage and Volunteer School. Since its opening, the number of buyers has been unprecedented. It was originally scheduled to end on the 20th, but due to the large number of exhibits and the limited space, all of them could not be displayed. The exhibition has been extended for four days. There are still today and tomorrow. Famous calligraphers and painters such as Wu Hufan, Ma Gongyu, Chen Xiaodie, Zheng Wuchang, Wang Yachen, etc., have new works added.</p>

<h3>Food: Over 20,000 More Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive, Japanese Merchants Hawk Annam Rice in the Market, Speculative Rice Merchants Are Greatly Discouraged</h3>
<p>Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. Yesterday, the Jardine Matheson's Dingsheng Wheel arrived with 7,527 bags from Hong Kong and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. The French Company's Xijiang Wheel arrived directly from Saigon with 1,000 tons, totaling 18,100 bags. It also arrived at the port at around 5:00 pm yesterday and docked at buoys 11 and 12. Unloading and transshipment will begin today. Furthermore, the Taikoo Company's Jinan Wheel, which arrived with 7,153 bags from Hong Kong the day before, was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the ship also had another 4,281 bags of foreign rice, totaling a huge 11,434 bags. This is a correction.</p>
<p>The arrival of foreign rice yesterday led to brisk sales and the market has already stabilized. However, market rumors are unfavorable to buyers, and the speculative rush business of "balloons" cannot be implemented due to the straight-line decline in market prices. However, some speculators have turned from being long to short, and are using their old trick of selling short and buying short. Although there is no continued selling by Chinese and foreign merchants in new transactions, Japanese merchants are leveraging their favorable position in Vietnam, the abundance of ship space, and the low cost of water and insurance. The night before and yesterday, they were canvassing for transactions in the market. Although there were no formal transactions in the market, it is heard that there have been telegrams and it is possible that there will be trial listings arriving in Shanghai in early November. As a result, people's hearts were immediately agitated, and the difference between forward and spot goods was small in the early morning. After noon, prices fell again. Although the late close was pulled up by shorts covering their positions, the result was that both forward and spot goods were more than one yuan lower than the night before. No. 2 West Buy spot goods were 82.78 yuan in the morning and 82 yuan in the afternoon, 1.78 yuan lower than 83.78 yuan the night before. November was 82.5 yuan in the morning and 81.8 yuan in the afternoon, 1.5 yuan lower. December was 80.08 yuan, 1 yuan lower. No. 1 December was from 84.5 yuan to 83.5 yuan, and there were still bids at 82.5 yuan. Xiaowen was 79.5 yuan in the morning and 79 yuan in the afternoon, also 1 yuan lower. The total amount returned to the market throughout the day was more than 700 tons, with 7,000 bags of spot rice.</p>
<p>The arrival of new japonica and wild rice tea seeds is not prosperous, but sales are also not smooth, so the supply and demand are balanced. If the original sentence is used, the new japonica still opens at 92 yuan and 90 yuan, the bucket sees 88 yuan to 86 yuan, the wild rice is 89 yuan, the Lvzong is 81 yuan, and the Duyang top is similar.</p>
<p>The market for glutinous rice is average, but because there is not much stock in the market, the price also lacks difference. Yili Baiyuan is 85 yuan and 83 yuan, Hong Kong Baiyuan is 78.5 yuan and 75 yuan.</p>
<h3>Discussions of Increasing Flour Mill Prices Again, Japanese Factories Ship Flour to the North</h3>
<p>The flour market is clearly stable but secretly tight. Since the price of rice has been expensive, the current demand for flour in this street has increased frequently, and there are even inquiries from Hakka merchants. Although a small amount of foreign flour has arrived in Shanghai, it has not been able to supply a large amount, so the situation is gradually tightening in secret. It is heard that the factory plans to increase the factory price again because the raw materials are rising again and cannot be purchased. It is currently under discussion. As a result, old car shops and warehouses have greedy hoarders, and the price must be 19.45 yuan. Foreign flour is also strong at the same time. Shuangying brand is sold at 19 yuan. 250 bags were collected from this street. As for Huachang's wholesale of more than 8,000 bags of No. 2 flour, the price is still 17 yuan, and the price for Hakka merchants is still 18.5 yuan, but there is no formal supply.</p>
<p>As for flour being transported to Tianjin, foreign ships have been gone for a long time, but there are still quite a few Japanese ships transporting it. All the goods are exported by the Japanese Sanxing Factory. Yesterday, 6,000 bags of flour were transported to Weihaiwei, which was returned goods (i.e., exchanged for raw peanuts transported from Weihaiwei). Yesterday, the Jardine Matheson's Dingsheng Wheel transported 800 bags of foreign flour from Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The trend of wheat is also secretly strong. Because the arrival of goods has been rare for a long time, Huachang cannot buy goods, and the source of foreign wheat is also hindered. Therefore, the factory continues to release prices to attract distant goods. It is heard that the Japanese factory also plans to collect at a price of 28 yuan and order from merchants again.</p>
<p>Yesterday's exports included 4,000 bags of corn to Weihaiwei and 300 bags to Yantai.</p>
<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange is Released into the Market, Increasing in Quantity</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market: HSBC's listed price remained unchanged. The dark market for British and American exchange rates saw a slight softening today. Yesterday, the telegram said that the Japanese army would actively advance south and there was talk of landing in Thailand. More households released more, while the number of "eaters" among peeling households except for foreign banks was very small. In the afternoon, the amount of Hong Kong electricity was huge and was once priced at 5.96875 yuan for the US exchange rate. However, the result was still stable, 0.015625 and 0.03125 yuan lower than the previous day, totaling 3 shillings 765625 for British gold and 5.9375 yuan for US exchange. The forward US exchange rate was squared off, and the forward British gold was slightly pulled apart.</p>
<p>Foreign Banks Still Buying</p>
<p>In the early morning, London's large bars, both near and far term, fell by 0.0625. New York's silver price remained flat. London's raw gold remained stable. The exchange rates of British to US and Shanghai were flat, and the US to British and Shanghai were without a market. The Central's listed prices for various exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening price for spot sales was 3 shillings 75 for British gold and 5.90625 yuan for US exchange, unchanged from the previous day's late close. After opening, Chinese merchants and speculators slightly squeezed out, and the market became firm, with November at 5.9375 yuan. At the same time, the banks also sold spot US exchange at a price of 5.9375 yuan. HSBC's listed price was announced and did not move. The silver balancing tax was announced to be 0.25% lower. After that, Hong Kong Electricity sold some US exchange, and the price for this month was still 5.90625 yuan. The above were all absorbed by foreign banks, and because their appetite was not weak, the potential was loose but still stable. Until noon, the rumors that the Japanese army was planning to land in Thailand did not affect people's hearts. At that time, a certain US bank went out to tell the US exchange rate for this month as 5.9375 yuan. The noon closing price was 3 shillings 765625 for British gold and 5.9375 yuan for US exchange, 0.025625 and 0.03125 yuan lower than the morning opening of each dread.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Fiercely Selling</p>
<p>In the late market, Hong Kong Electricity fiercely sold, and the US exchange rate once reached 5.96875 yuan. Objects Hong Kong Electricity sold the first order of the next month for 3 shillings 765625, and also sold the same month US exchange for 5.96875 yuan. Later, China Bank Jincheng came in with the same month US exchange, and the US Bank settled it at 5.9375 yuan. Speculators also sold to the benefit of both at 5.9375 yuan. The late close was 3 shillings 765625 for British gold spot and for this month, and 3 shillings 75 for December. The US exchange rate was consistently 5.9375 yuan, 0.015625 higher than the British's hard one. The forward was unchanged, and the forward US exchange rate was 0.03125 longer than the current.</p>
<p>Hong Kong US Exchange Rate Softened</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 22nd (Friday) Electric: This morning, the exchange market opened bullish and stable, and there were no changes in any exchange rates (the British exchange spot closed hard at 1 shilling and 3 pence yesterday, and the forward remained unchanged). At 11:30, it was announced that it was flat. The US exchange spot rate was hard at 0.0625, at 23 and 6875. The rest remained unchanged. The market opened steadily at 2:30 pm. The Shanghai exchange spot rate fell by 1.5 yuan to 396.5 yuan, and the rest remained unchanged.</p>

<p>Tianjin, 22nd (Friday) Electric: This morning, the exchange market opened and reported loose. The London telegraphic transfer was hard at 0.15625, at 4 pence 15625.

The "Federal Notes" dark market was cheap at 4.25 yuan, at 92 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Market Plunges Near Noon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash gold market was initially stable, but a sudden drop occurred around noon. From 11:30 AM, rumors of Japan actively invading the south spread, and under the pressure of large-scale foreign exchange selling in Hong Kong, the market shifted from stable to loose. The sentiment of all parties became weary. Opening lower than the previous day's decline at 5,670 yuan, subsequent trading was mostly dominated by retail investors, with price fluctuations of only a few dozen yuan, once rising to 5,682 yuan. Unexpectedly, at noon, rumors of profit-taking sales suddenly emerged, and foreign exchange rates were reported to be strong, leading to a downward trend. Securities firms, banks, and foreign exchange merchants aggressively sold. In the afternoon, a certain money shop sold down to 5,622 yuan. However, foreign exchange was soon absorbed by HSBC and other British banks, abruptly halting the decline with a slight rebound. The price also increased due to aggressive buying from cash shops, ultimately closing at 5,635 yuan, a drop of 45 yuan. The total daily transaction volume was 3,670 taels. The cash price was 6-7 yuan lower than the forward price. No forward trading was reported. Jewelry gold and customs gold remained stable.</p>
<p>Gold Drops 45 Yuan</p>
<p>The market opened with slightly higher foreign exchange rates, leading to some fatigue in sentiment. At the opening, banks quoted 30 taels at 5,670 yuan, 10 yuan lower than the previous day's closing. Subsequently, due to selling pressure from securities firms, the price continued to fall by 10 yuan, with banks trading 20 taels, reaching 5,660 yuan. However, at this time, retail investors saw the low price and rushed to buy, causing the price to rebound. Banks bought 30 taels, reaching 5,682 yuan. But soon, securities firms resumed selling, causing the price to fall again. Gold shops sold 20 taels to banks at only 5,652 yuan. At noon closing, banks traded 10 taels at only 5,657 yuan. The afternoon situation was lackluster, with banks continuously selling. Initially, banks traded 20 taels at 5,625 yuan. Later, securities firms absorbed some, rising by 20 yuan. Securities firms bought 30 taels from banks at 5,645 yuan, while banks sold 20 taels to securities firms at only 5,620 yuan. Before the closing, gold shops bought in, potentially halting the decline. They bought 30 taels from banks at 5,640 yuan, and then 10 taels at 5,635 yuan, as the late closing price. After the closing, it was heard that trading occurred around 5,620 yuan, a drop of 45 yuan compared to the previous day. The daily fluctuation was 50 yuan. The selling price of cash shops' own brand gold was several dozen yuan higher than the spot price, while the buying price was 30 yuan lower. The spot price was 50-60 yuan lower than the listed price, with little trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold in silver shops remained unchanged. Da Tong Heng quoted 580 yuan per tael, with Xin Tong Heng offering similar prices. The buying price was reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<p>US Dollar Continues to Deteriorate</p>
<p>In the foreign currency market, spot prices fluctuated downwards. British and American gold pounds also fell by one yuan each. British gold notes remained thinly traded, with prices remaining stable. US dollar notes continued to deteriorate, falling to 16 yuan 3 jiao 6 fen in the evening market, a decrease of 1 jiao 7 fen compared to the previous day's closing. Hong Kong dollar notes were firm, rising to 4 yuan in the evening market. Japanese gold notes and Korean notes had balanced supply and demand, with prices remaining stable. The former remained at 1 yuan 5 jiao 3 fen, while the latter remained at 1 yuan 1 jiao 5 fen.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market: Speculative Sentiment Weakens; Cotton Yarn Plummets, "Double Horse" Brand Falls Below 1,200 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to decline, with a particularly strong downward trend. This was due to speculators anticipating a fall, leading to unanimous downward sentiment. At the same time, actual sales were relatively weak. Rumors of Western buying benefited short sellers, leading to extremely active selling and a surge in short positions. The market's holdings loosened, and the market gradually declined. The final price for 20-count "Double Horse" brand yarn broke below the 1,200 yuan mark. Major players and banks remained calm and unmoved. Today, 940 bales of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Spot yarn trading was sluggish due to unfavorable conditions, with most people expecting a fall and leaning towards selling. The opening price for 20-count "Double Horse" brand yarn was 1,220 yuan, quickly falling to 1,217 yuan. News of stable foreign exchange rates then caused it to rise again to 1,213 yuan. However, as prices rose, short selling became even more active, and the market turned downward again to 1,212 yuan. The price fluctuated around 1,210 yuan for a long time. Later, various rumors circulated, and selling became more intense, breaking below the 1,200 yuan mark in an instant, closing at 1,198 yuan. According to half-day transaction statistics, 6,230 bales were traded. The price of 20-count "Double Horse" brand yarn fell by 30 yuan. The amount bought by each group is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 6,125 bales</p>
<p>Same Trade: 150 bales</p>
<p>Total: 6,230 bales</p>
<h3>Cotton Prices Remain Difficult to Ease</h3>
<p>The spot cotton situation is bleak, as the sluggish yarn market has discouraged manufacturers from buying. However, inventories are gradually decreasing, so sentiment remains strong, and prices are difficult to ease. The overall situation is one of advancing and retreating with difficulty.</p>
<p>In the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market was closed yesterday for Thanksgiving, and the entire United States was closed. The Indian market was also closed, with forecasts predicting a drop of more than two rupees.</p>
<p>Trading in foreign cotton in Shanghai has been quiet lately, with factories showing less interest in purchasing. Traders are also unwilling to sell their goods cheaply, so trading on the market has been slow all day.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Sharp Fall in Yarn Prices Said to Be Related to the Increase in "Unified Tax" on Cotton Cloth</h3>
<p>Flowers do not always bloom, and the moon is not always full. The booming scene of cotton yarn is gradually fading as in the past. Consider that daily trading often involved 5,000-6,000 bales, but yesterday, only 3,675 bales of 20-count "Double Horse" brand yarn were traded, a decrease of about 2,000 bales compared to the previous day. The price rose slightly from the opening price of 1,239 yuan to 1,242 yuan in the mid-morning, but it was clearly weak and powerless. The closing price then fell back to 1,236 yuan. This was the market on the 21st. Today (the 22nd, as the author is writing), the opening price followed the influence of the previous afternoon's after-hours trading, opening at only 1,220 yuan. It briefly rose to 1,223 yuan in the middle of the day, but ultimately could not sustain the rise and gradually fell to 1,217 yuan, 1,211 yuan, and then to a low of 1,209 yuan. (Note: The final closing price was 1,198 yuan.)</p>
<p>Interviewing about the reasons for the sharp fall in yarn prices, the common observations are: (1) Actual sales are again stagnant; (2) Foreign cotton news is declining; (3) Cotton yarn stockpiles remain thick; (4) The transport of goods to the mainland via the Burma Road has not yet been realized; (5) Seasonal export orders are falling. The aforementioned five points are known to everyone who is involved in the cotton yarn market.</p>
<p>There is also a major reason for the "sharp fall in yarn prices," which is that the unified factory tax on cotton cloth will be increased starting next month (December 1st). Therefore, factories such as Shenxin and Xinyu have already published notices urging customers with cotton cloth factory warehouse receipts to clear their stocks before the end of this month, otherwise the change in the unified tax rate will be borne by the customers. This "death warrant" has had an impact on the cotton yarn market. Customers holding cotton yarn factory receipts, fearing that the cotton yarn tax rate will also change, are reluctant to ship goods and are trying to sell them. As the number of holdings increases, the sentiment of those who are long is shrinking. In addition, there are rumors in the market that Abe is going to Chongqing to seek peace, leading to a chorus of selling, and the yarn price immediately plunged. According to discussions among industry insiders, given the current situation and environment, the price of 20-count "Double Horse" brand yarn will likely not be able to hold at 1,200 yuan. Therefore, outside speculators are following the lead of industry insiders and going short. At the same time, scalpers are gradually giving up, and the volume of transactions is decreasing day by day, no longer as vibrant as it was in the middle of last month. In such an environment, artificial manipulation and the technique of feigning retreat are only fleeting. (Ju)</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Soars, Many Bonds Reach New Peaks</h3>
<p>In the after-hours securities market, yesterday's market continued to rise, with Classes A, B, C, and E all reaching new high prices. Class C once broke through 4 yuan, and Class E also reached as high as 4 yuan. However, due to the excessive rise, it triggered profit-taking by long positions and a surge in short selling, leading to a pullback of five or six jiao. However, it was still several jiao to one yuan higher than the previous day. The large increase followed by a small pullback was due to the floating long positions taking profits immediately. The large-scale absorption by overseas Chinese was partly due to the strong atmosphere of peace and partly due to the abundance of idle funds, making it easier to raise the market price. Yesterday morning, buyers such as Jiafu, Hengkang, Xinhua, and Defu were all buying on behalf of the financial sector or overseas Chinese. Companies such as Jiufeng, Changji, Hengfu, Zhenkang, Hongda, Datongkang, etc., were either covering shorts or had investment needs, and were also very excited. Companies such as Tongshun, Renchang, Shengda, Zhongfu, Datong, and Lianyi were either cutting long positions or going short, and mostly failed. At the noon closing, except for Class D, all other classes reached new high prices. In the afternoon, Xinfu, Xinhua, and Hongda continued to buy, and Nos. 8 and 14, Lianhe, Yitai, and Lianyi all had needs. Classes B, C, and E all reached new high prices again. Shichang and Xiexing suddenly came to go short, seeing an opportunity to profit. As a result, Yuxing, Tongshun, and most retail investors sold, and the market price slightly loosened. However, the result was still five jiao and a half to one yuan and one jiao better than the previous day. The total transaction volume was more than 3.56 million yuan. A summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 50 shares of Nanyang Tobacco Company stock at 16 yuan 2 jiao, and 90 shares of Dachunghua Match Company stock at 25 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public utilities stock market was very stable again. The Yinglian and Kenzhi stocks were the most active, with transaction prices slightly better than before. Most operators seemed unwilling to hold long positions overnight on the weekend, but they were also not in a hurry to sell. As a result, the market closed in an absolutely stable position. Rubber stocks had slight demand.</p>
<p>London, 21st (Thursday) Telegram: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks remain flat, and the market is generally unchanged.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Sentiment Weak, "Dragon Head" Fine Cloth Plummets</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market was flat yesterday, which was due to the continuous depreciation of yarn prices and weak sentiment. However, Cantonese and Hong Kong merchants were actively selling spot goods, and Zhejiang merchants were also actively advancing goods, so demand was strong. As a result, the selling price fell only slightly. White goods, coarse and fine cloth, twill, and colored cloth fell by one jiao to two jiao and a half per piece. Yuchou, gongduan, and bleached cloth from factories such as Lunchang and Yihe were scarce, and each file was raised by two jiao and a half to five jiao per piece. Cantonese and Hong Kong merchants handled more than 500 pieces of poplin, bleached cloth, coarse cloth, colored cloth, etc., and Fujian and Zhejiang merchants handled more than 200 pieces of bleached cloth, colored cloth, colored twill, etc. About 600 pieces of various goods were traded on this street. More than 3,000 pieces of colored cloth and bleached cloth were handled for Singapore and other countries. On the 23rd, 1,600 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Eastern cloth market continued to fall as speculative retail investors leaned towards selling. "Dragon Head" fine cloth fell by more than one yuan per piece, and the market closed at 34 yuan 4 jiao. Mid-range fine cloth fell by six or seven jiao, and fine twill fell by only two jiao and a half. Serge fell by two fen, and Junzi Serge closed at one yuan and six fen. Because the industry insiders' sentiment remained firm, while outsiders were selling, "Dragon Head" fell the most.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Sees Some Transactions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market in New York was closed. The Yokohama spot price remained at 1,350 yuan. The recent November price was 1,354 yuan, and the distant price was 1,382 yuan, slightly down 1-2 yuan from the previous day. The Shanghai silk market had sluggish exports. Yihe bought seven or eight loads. White factory silk was 700 yuan, and Zhili silk was 3,400 yuan. 20 loads were traded, it is said.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Crude Oil Rises Briefly Then Fades</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the peanut oil market initially continued to flourish in the morning due to inquiries from Hong Kong merchants for spot goods, and sentiment continued to improve. The market price was half a yuan higher than the previous day. In the afternoon, however, large-scale stockpilers took advantage of the high prices to release forward contracts, and general scalpers switched direction at the sight of the wind. The market atmosphere suddenly became gloomy, and the market price gradually declined. As a result, the price of spot goods was maintained, while forward contracts fell by two yuan. Actual sales of soybean oil remained weak, and the market price ultimately failed to improve, falling back by half a yuan. According to statistics, 50 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil were traded at a price of 75 yuan 5 jiao. 20 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil were traded at a price of 78 yuan. 50 loads of Dayouyu factory oil were traded at a price of 84 yuan 5 jiao. 250 pieces of Jiaozhou crude oil were traded at a price of 78 yuan to 77 yuan 5 jiao. 50 barrels of Qingdao crude oil were traded at a price of 107 yuan 5 jiao. More than 1,000 barrels were ordered for delivery in December, with prices ranging from 107 yuan 2 jiao and a half to 108 yuan, gradually falling to 105 yuan 5 jiao. 40 pieces of Yantai crude oil were traded at a price of 77 yuan, and 1,000 cans of canned oil were traded at a price of 107 yuan.</p>
<p>On the 23rd, 660 bags of soybeans, 7,910 pieces of soybean cake, 400 bags of shelled peanuts, 560 cans of crude oil, 400 bags of sesame, and 430 cans of sesame oil were all shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Preserved Mustard Greens Source at Risk of Interruption, Price High Due to Large External Fees</h3>
<p>Sichuan preserved mustard greens have recently been transported directly from Hankou, but external fees are extremely large, so the number of arrivals is small. The market inventory is very thin, and the market price is quite high, selling for 280 yuan. If there are no further arrivals, there will inevitably be a shortage, and there is no hope of easing in the future market.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Taikoo White Sugar Softens Again; The Outlet of Domestic Sugar Is Controlled</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to decline due to extremely scattered transactions. The association's dividing plate, the spot 24 coarse white foreign warehouse goods called 72 and a half yuan, the original plate, did not conclude a deal, the existing plate of the Dutch red is still 56 yuan, the same price for the 10th of December signing, Taikoo white B label West Warehouse 74 and a half yuan, small triangle, DY label West Warehouse 69 yuan 3 jiao, East Warehouse 69 yuan, small 2 jiao, HX label West Warehouse 69 yuan 1 jiao, East Warehouse 68 yuan 8 jiao, small 34 jiao, domestic sugar has no quotations, because the outlet is controlled by a certain party, resulting in a long-term tired and difficult situation, yesterday 150 bags of sugar came from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Kelp and Tapioca Flour See Strength</h3>
<p>The kelp market has a thin inventory and there is a shortage, so the selling price is strong, yesterday the price of Chong Lion Hair kelp was 71 yuan 2 jiao, Xilan kelp 68 yuan, Juezhi kelp 65 yuan 5 jiao, Longya kelp 62 yuan 6 jiao.</p>
<p>Tapioca flour has a scarce stock and is actively selling, each mark has increased by 2 yuan, checking the upper mark is even scarcer, the future market is still looking tight, sago is good, both large and small grains are sold at 78 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal: Coal Briquettes Rise Endlessly, With Another 12 Yuan Added</h3>
<p>The coal briquette factory plate, increased the price by 8 yuan once in the former ten days, all walks of life have said something about the inferior quality of coal briquettes lately, unexpectedly yesterday, the market also said that the factory warehouse receipts will be added another 12 yuan, the industry has increased from 140 yuan to 152 yuan, adding and adding again and rising endlessly, quite sad, but the current selling price of each factory is uneven, and there are still those who sell at the original price, quite uneven.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Gardenia Shortage Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Due to the prolonged lack of sources for yellow gardenia, with no shipments arriving from Shantou, Fujian, and other places, the market stock is exceptionally short. The current market price has risen by ten yuan, but there is still not much available for supply. There is no hope for prices to fall until new goods arrive in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Beauty Wins Chinese Essay Award, Immediately Flies to Chongqing for Sightseeing; Chairman Chiang and Wife Will Host Her; Winners Awarded in New York; Essay Concerns "Our Stakes in China's Future"</h3>
<p>Many prominent figures in American society, in order to promote public concern for China, recently held a Chinese essay contest titled "Our Stakes in China's Future." The winner of the first prize, Ms. Disin from New Jersey, received US$1,200 and a free trip to Chongqing, China, aboard a Clipper flying boat, where Chairman Chiang and Madame Chiang will host her. The second prize went to Mr. Cole from Ohio, who received US$750, and the third prize went to Ms. Alfred from California.</p>
<p>Grand Banquet Held in New York</p>
<p>This competition, sponsored by the Continental Corporation, recently held a banquet at the Ford Motor Exhibition Hall at the New York World's Fair to host the winners and present the awards. At the banquet, Admiral Yarnell, former commander of the US Navy's Asiatic Fleet, delivered a speech stating that the United States has a vital interest in the Far Eastern situation. Other guests who gave speeches included Pearl S. Buck, former president of Xiangya Medical College, Mr. Angel, and Mr. Pan Lai, president of Continental Corporation.</p>
<h3>US Restricts Citizens' Travel to the Far East</h3>
<p>According to foreign sources yesterday, during the current period when the Far Eastern crisis has not been completely eliminated, the US government has strict restrictions on issuing passports to people requesting to travel to the Far East. It is said that many Americans want to travel to the Far East every day, but they are all denied the issuance of this certificate. To apply to the State Department for a passport, one must state the reason for travel. If the applicant is a businessman, there is still hope for approval. If the nature of the trip is tourism, it is generally prohibited. As for women and children, it is absolutely impossible to obtain this travel passport.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Vietnam Navigation Maintained as Usual</h3>
<p>Since Japanese troops attempted to land in Saigon, the situation in Vietnam has suddenly become tense. The Chinese government has ordered the blockade of traffic between Qiyue and has stopped issuing travel passports. All cargo and mail deliveries have been interrupted. However, according to the Daguan News Agency's investigation, shipping between Shanghai and Vietnam is currently still being maintained. The French Post Company's cargo ship, S.S. Kindia, arrived in Shanghai from Saigon with a large shipment of foreign rice the day before yesterday and has already completed unloading. It is scheduled to set sail from the Shun Tai Wharf in Hongkou on the 25th (Monday), directly heading to Saigon and Haiphong. The ship only carries more than 5,000 tons of cotton yarn and cloth and does not carry passengers. Also, the company's Xijiang ship arrived in Shanghai from Saigon yesterday evening, carrying more than 14,200 bags of foreign rice from Saigon, and is moored at the 11th and 12th floating pontoons. Whether subsequent voyages will continue depends on the development of the situation in Vietnam.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Branches of Four Banks (Central, China, Communications, and Agriculture) Do Not Reduce Interest Rates</h3>
<p>Commercial banks in Shanghai, in view of the abundance of idle funds and the lack of proper investment channels, have implemented reductions in interest rates on demand deposits in order to avoid wasting interest. In addition to the Shanghai, Zhejiang Industrial, Jin Cheng, Continental, Salt Industry, Zhongnan, and Guohua banks, and the Four Banks Savings Association, which have already implemented this, the Zhejiang Xingye Bank has decided, due to market conditions, to change the interest rate on demand deposits to an annual rate of 2.5% starting on December 1. As for the Shanghai branches of the Central, China, Communications, and Agriculture banks, they are not taking any interest rate reduction actions. It is said that the deposits absorbed by these four banks have long been transferred to the interior. It is reported that the four banks have recently made significant investments in the interior, developing transportation and the economy in the southwest.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Plague Eradicated, Shanghai Not Affected</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs' announcement of implementing plague inspection measures on ships sailing from Zhejiang to Shanghai was due to the outbreak of plague in Ningbo. Shanghai and Ningbo are only a night's journey away, and to prevent infection, a strict inspection system is being implemented on ships sailing from Zhejiang to Shanghai to ensure safety. Currently, there are no direct ships between Shanghai and Ningbo, and those who transfer to ships to Shanghai via other ports have to undergo a considerable journey within Zhejiang Province, which is very unsuitable for the bodies of plague patients. Due to these reasons, Shanghai is expected not to be affected. It is now known that the Ningbo plague has been eradicated, so it can be said that this port can rest assured. The Jianghai Customs' quarantine measures for Zhejiang ships have not actually been implemented.</p>
<h3>Travelers Passing Through Zha Pu Face Many Dangers</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping line was blockaded, passengers returning to and from have been detouring through Zha Pu. According to people coming from Zha Pu who witnessed the scene, the Japanese army, under the pretext of preventing the plague and preventing other actions, acted in a very frightened manner. Therefore, within a few days, they blockaded the Qiantang River, prohibiting ships from traveling to and from eastern Zhejiang. Chinese people, unaware of the details, still sailed their ships over. When the Japanese army saw the ships approaching the shore, they immediately fired small steel cannons at them, sinking the ships. Many people were injured and drowned. However, those who were not injured tried to escape by swimming. As they approached the shore, the Japanese army drove them back into the water and strafed them with machine guns, causing them all to perish miserably. Therefore, travelers going to and from should not detour through Zha Pu again to avoid danger.</p>
<h3>Draft Regulations for Leases in the French Concession Drawn Up; Residents May Express Opinions, Which Will Be Submitted to the Consul-General for Review</h3>
<p>Mr. Duc, chairman of the French Concession Housing Rent Research Committee, recently distributed the draft regulations on the leasing, subleasing, and transfer of real estate within the concession to the committee members for study. Residents of the French Concession who wish to express their opinions on the draft decree to Mr. Li Jia, secretary of the committee, at the Bureau of Public Works, 375 Avenue Joffre, are welcome to do so. All opinions from committee members and other residents should be submitted to the French Consul-General after December 17, 1940. The Consul-General will decide, within his authority, the most effective measures to reduce the housing rent burden on residents. The reasons for drafting these regulations are as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons</p>
<p>The French Consul-General in Shanghai, in accordance with Article 13 of the organizational charter of the Shanghai French Concession Bureau of Public Works promulgated by Decree No. 27 of January 15, 1927, promulgated the "Regulations on the Leasing, Subleasing, and Transfer of Real Estate within the Shanghai French Concession," along with the following reasons: Since the outbreak of the war, the crowding of the city and economic panic have led to speculation and abuse of rights. Authorities in various countries around the world have had to take special measures, and the provincial governments and special municipal governments of China have also invoked the provisions of Article 161 of the Land Law and various other articles, and have also restricted the principles of freedom of contract and private agreement in accordance with special measures to maintain public order. In order to maintain peace and tranquility in this concession, it is necessary to take emergency measures. Therefore, these regulations are specially formulated for the public to abide by.</p>
<h3>Today is Myanmar National Day; Eight Principles Established to Build a New Nation; Promoted by Cooperation between China, Britain, and Myanmar</h3>
<p>Today (the 23rd) is Myanmar National Day. The Yangon government radio station (frequency 6007) will broadcast three broadcasts at 10:15 AM and 11:15 AM (Shanghai time). The Yangon bishop is scheduled to give a lecture tomorrow at 9:00 PM. According to Dr. Facasson, he pre-broadcasted on the Yulin West News Radio Station two days ago (the 21st) stating that Myanmar is currently promoting a liberation movement led by leaders from China, Britain, and Myanmar. This movement is based on eight principles, and when the plan is completed, it is expected to produce a new nation.</p>
<h3>Command of the Volunteer Corps Will Be Taken Over by Mann; Colonel Henby Scheduled to Leave Shanghai</h3>
<p>Colonel Henby, commander of the Shanghai Municipal Council Volunteer Corps, has resigned from his position as commander of the Volunteer Corps due to his impending return to his home country next spring. He is scheduled to leave Shanghai for England in early February next year. The vacant position of commander of the Volunteer Corps will be taken over by Major Mann. Originally, the headquarters of the Volunteer Corps had one commander and two deputy commanders. Major Mann was originally the deputy commander. The Municipal Council is now seeking to save expenses and will change the two deputy commanders to one. This will be implemented after Colonel Henby leaves office. At that time, the commander of the Volunteer Corps will be Major Mann, and the deputy commander will be Major Badeley.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Increases Bus Fares on All Highways</h3>
<p>According to transportation sources, the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Transportation Company has recently increased bus fares to 1 jiao 4 fen per kilometer due to the limited supply and high prices of gasoline, as well as the continued rise in social prices, in order to maintain balance. This has been implemented since the middle of this month.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Meeting of Various Charitable Organizations - Resolution on Winter Relief Policy - Increase Efforts to Raise Funds Due to High Prices - Establish Half-Shelters and Provide Rice and Clothing</h3>
<p>Various charitable organizations in Shanghai, considering the arrival of winter and the high rice prices, which will inevitably increase the number of impoverished people suffering from cold and hunger, convened a joint meeting at the Gong De Lin in Baker Road at 6:00 PM yesterday to discuss expanding relief efforts. Attendees included representatives from over ten organizations, such as the Refugee Relief Association, the Shanghai Charity Relief Association, Renji Hall, the Chinese Red Cross, and the Red Swastika Society. They discussed issues such as expanding fundraising for winter relief, and the results were very satisfactory.</p>
<p>High Prices and Increased Poverty</p>
<p>A reporter from Da Zhong News Agency inquired yesterday with a certain Mr. of Shiji Hall about the arrangements for this year's winter relief. The reply was as follows: "This year's cost of living in Shanghai is almost double that of last year. Furthermore, due to the Japanese blockade and the inability to transport raw materials from the interior to Shanghai, many factories in Shanghai have been forced to lay off workers or reduce their workforce. Due to these two reasons, the number of impoverished people has greatly increased. The cost of winter relief has also increased due to high prices. For example, a set of cotton clothes that cost only about three yuan last year now costs no less than seven or eight yuan. Therefore, it is necessary to step up fundraising for winter relief. We hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will generously donate to support this charitable cause."</p>
<p>Five Aspects of Winter Relief Measures</p>
<p>The specific measures for this year's winter relief are divided into the following aspects: (1) Relief for the Hidden Poor; (2) Establishment of Shelters; (3) Distribution of Porridge and Rice; (4) Distribution of Steamed Buns; (5) Distribution of Clothing. Regarding the relief work for the hidden poor, we will conduct a thorough investigation to identify those who are in dire need of relief due to hunger and cold but find it difficult to openly beg. We will provide them with clothing and rice. Shelters are held every winter as a regular practice, but this year they will only accommodate the elderly, weak, and disabled. The distribution of steamed buns has been implemented on a trial basis since last year and has achieved good results. This year, we will continue to implement it.</p>
<p>Two Resolutions on Clothing Distribution Measures</p>
<p>Regarding the specific measures for clothing distribution, over ten charitable organizations in Shanghai had already agreed at a joint meeting held at Renji Hall the day before yesterday (the 21st). The measures are as follows: (1) To prevent the recipients from selling the distributed clothing, the clothing will be distributed by the charitable organizations and marked with a clear sign. (2) Private donations for clothing distribution must be given only to those who are confirmed to be poor. The estimated total number of clothing items to be distributed this winter is approximately five thousand, but it depends on the availability of funds. In short, let us not forget the impoverished people crying from hunger and cold and extend a helping hand. It is also an expression of human compassion.</p>
<h3>New Stamps - To Be Issued on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>After the implementation of the increase in domestic postage rates, the printing of new stamps has been undertaken by the Hong Kong China Bookstore. The process is now mostly completed. It is reported that the printing plate is still the original plate kept by the former Beiping Printing Bureau. However, the colors have changed slightly. There are two denominations, four cents and eight cents. The issue date has been set for New Year's Day next year. At that time, the General Post Office will distribute them to post offices nationwide for public use. The old stamps can also be used in the same way.</p>

<h3>Hongkou Residents, Startled Birds, Experience Another Disturbance - Investigation Reveals Japanese Drunk Randomly Firing a Gun - Outside Rumors Already Exist - Investigation Confirms Inaccuracy</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin Daily reported that at approximately 11:30 PM on the 19th of this month, two gunshots were suddenly heard near the Hongkou District Police Station. Shortly after, Japanese army and navy soldiers appeared on the streets to conduct an investigation. Residents in the area were unaware of the true situation, leading to another disturbance. This was because several Japanese military officers had been ambushed in Hongkou recently. Rumors spread quickly among Chinese residents, one saying that another Japanese military officer had been assassinated on a certain street in Wusong Road. This was later proven to be inaccurate. The gunshots were actually fired by a drunk Japanese man, who was apprehended by public concession police officers and taken to the Hongkou Police Station, before being handed over to the Japanese Consulate Police Department.</p>
<h3>Soochow University Faculty and Students - Commemorate Zhu Hua - To Be Held Today at the Tzu Shu Building - Faculty, Staff and Students Mourn This Person Together</h3>
<p>Ever since Zhu Hua (also known as Zhu Hua), a third-year student in the Architecture Department of Soochow University, was shot and killed by the police after advising his younger brother not to get involved in a gang fight, there has been a public outcry. As Zhu Hua was an outstanding student during his time at the university and got along well with teachers and friends, the faculty and students of Soochow University were deeply saddened and indignant upon hearing the news of his death. They collectively voiced their disapproval. For the sake of commemoration, the Architecture Society of the university, with the approval of the university authorities, initiated a memorial service, which will be held today at 4:15 PM at Room 320, 3rd Floor, Tzu Shu Building, Nanjing Road.</p>
<p>Exhibition of Posthumous Works</p>
<p>In order to avoid excessive extravagance and unnecessary consumption, the memorial ceremony will be simple and solemn. At that time, many of Zhu Hua's posthumous works, various architectural design drawings, will also be exhibited for mourning. His younger brother plans to personally attend the meeting to report on his brother's innocent death and other circumstances. The Architecture Society, which is responsible for preparing the memorial service, has sent invitations to relevant schools to send representatives to attend. Students of the university who wish to attend the memorial service are eager to participate. It is estimated that no less than one hundred people will attend at that time.</p>
<p>President to Attend</p>
<p>Moreover, the faculty and staff of Soochow University are extremely grieved by the student's unfortunate passing. When the memorial service is held this afternoon, President Li Pei'en, Acting President Ming Side, Dean Tan Dakai, Director of Student Affairs Zhuo Riren, and many other department heads and professors from the Architecture Department all intend to participate in person to mourn this person together and deliver speeches to express their condolences. This memorial service is completely open to the public. Those in charge welcome outsiders to participate.</p>
<p>Program of the General Assembly</p>
<p>The program of today's memorial service is as follows: (1) Everyone stands in silence; (2) Flower presentation; (3) Bow three times to the portrait; (3) Silent mourning; (4) Reading of the eulogy; (5) Speech by the master of ceremonies; (6) Speech by teachers; (7) Speech by classmates; (8) Reply by family members; (9) End of the ceremony.</p>
<h3>Chinese Women's Temperance Association - Holds Charity Bazaar</h3>
<p>The Chinese Women's Temperance Association, located at No. 80 Xieqiao Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, and its affiliated Xinsheng Refugee Craft Workshop, is facing difficulties in providing supplies due to soaring prices. It has scheduled a charity sale on the 23rd and 24th of this month at its premises. In addition to handicrafts made by the Xinsheng refugees, ladies from all walks of life and major companies and businesses who enthusiastically support the refugee production and relief cause will generously donate items to participate in the bazaar and support the charitable cause together. The time is from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Most of the items on display are daily necessities, and the prices are not expensive.</p>
<h3>Autumn Colors of the Flower Show (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Ai Nong</p>
<p>On the two tables next to it were the works of another Chinese member, Mr. Kong Zhiqing. Mr. Kong won the first prize certificate, and his works have their own value. There were more than twenty potted landscapes participating, mostly water and stone landscapes, large and small, varied and different. Each pot has its own poetic sentiment, and each pot has its own artistic conception, as if seeing many masterpieces of landscape paintings by famous painters in a national art exhibition. All kinds of bonsai plants are also trimmed properly, excelling purely in technique. The most meaningful bonsai is the "Dawn" with the Great Wall of China as the background. In this small pot, you can see that China's beautiful rivers and mountains are still intact, which unconsciously arouses patriotism. There were many business cards on his table, and I learned that Mr. Kong uses this as a profession, establishing a new banner in the Baile Commercial Market, and his works are often on display. In the future, there will often be opportunities to visit. He gave me a pot of fertilizer powder from the "Immortal" brand, which is said to be the latest invention, specially for potted plants. Once applied, it can make the flowers and trees in the pot very bright in two weeks. I will take it back and try it.</p>
<p>There are also works by other Westerners, which are divided into categories and concentrated on a long table. On the table are chrysanthemums, equipped with various vases and flower baskets, dazzling and too late to appreciate one by one. There are also works by students from Western schools, colorful and well-arranged.</p>
<p>In a large hall on the left, large chrysanthemums are displayed, all in neat and regular styles, catering to Western tastes. And most of the various fruits and vegetables are also eaten by Westerners. However, whether it is a vegetable or a radish, they are all fresh and large, making anyone's appetite stimulated.</p>
<p>It took a full two hours to appreciate this fleeting glance. That night, I had a good dream full of flowers, as if I were in a country of fragrance, truly feeling like an immortal. (End)</p>
<p>If you can't see a movie, you have to enjoy the advertisement; it's nothing more than drawing cakes to satisfy your hunger and quenching your thirst with plums. Who is the great dictator?</p>
<p>"It's Chaplin." Before we burst into laughter, we felt that in the moment before laughing, there was really restraint and content!</p>
<p>We won't worry about how this film will make us laugh. But Chaplin said, "Laughter is always beneficial to health." Further, his father said, "Laughter can also make those who behave improperly in the world know how to love themselves." Therefore, the purpose of his producing this film, according to himself, is very simple.</p>
<p>The one on the right is indeed an advertisement, a movie advertisement from the New York Times, just like the advertisements published in our newspaper every day. I don't know how many movie fans will be coaxed to see the masterpiece of the world's only comedian.</p>
<p>Chaplin is the epitome of laughter, just like when we see in advertisements: "Lipton Meanstea" - leave secret tons of "tea" too - in general. As soon as you see his big name, there is no one who will not laugh. Therefore, having Chaplin star in "The Great Dictator" is nothing more than taking a joke and making a joke. But the things in the world, the simpler they are, the more unbreakable they feel. Seeing the three words Chaplin has already made people laugh, why Chaplin represents "dictator"!</p>
<p>On Monday, the fifteenth of last month, "The Great Dictator" made its first public appearance in New York. The Astor and Capitol theaters simultaneously premiered it, at 8:45 PM. The protagonist Chaplin quietly traveled from Hollywood to New York on a "American Airlines flight" on Saturday and Sunday, got off at LaGuardia Airport, and stayed at a friend's house in New York. On the night of the premiere, he and the main supporting actors in the film, his wife, Ms. Pauline Goddard, and Jack Wakai, who played Napollini (pay attention to the two words "lini" in Napollini) in the play, attended the premiere ceremony together. They were greeted by movie fans as if they were crazy. When Chaplin made this film, he shot a total of 500,000 feet of film, selected and cut twelve large volumes, which can be shown for one hour and forty minutes.</p>
<p>What exactly is the plot of "The Great Dictator", which has been so long-awaited, that it took Chaplin two years and a huge capital of more than 1.2 million US dollars to make it? In fact, although Chaplin performs brainless, neurotic, or foolishly funny actions in various films, as well as all kinds of expressions that make people laugh and cry ("suffering in the stomach, smiling on the face"), he himself is a hard-working, practical, and tough - (these three words do not seem to be funny) a businessman with organizational ability. If you compare the Chaplin you see on the screen, who has already transformed, with the Chaplin in his original appearance, and think that he is two in one, then you will lose by thousands of miles if you are only slightly off. And how can this ancestor of comedy always sit on the throne of the country of laughter, as stable as Mount Tai, without any signs of disturbance?</p>
<p>We must know that Chaplin's humor is a laugh from the heart. This kind of laugh is not bound by time and space, and does not distinguish between men, women, old and young. All "people" will laugh, because laughter is what makes a person. Conversely, if you can laugh at Chaplin's funny actions, then this person will also cry. Chaplin uses the philosophy of crying to cause laughter to occur. The deeper the degree of sadness, injustice, pain, and oppression, the thicker the content of laughter he performs. The reason why the plot of "The Great Dictator" is so happy and funny is really because there are too many places hidden with sadness and pain!</p>
<p>The plot of "The Great Dictator" is very simple. You will laugh when you see it once, and you will find it even funnier when you see it again. If you see it three or four...five...times, there is nothing but laughter. It turns out that the final ending of the story is that the dictator himself is a spring dream. The little Jewish barber, in absolutely "unintentionally", adds unexpected facts to the totalitarian country under the dictator's rule - launching a revolution, it's really a joke!</p>
<p>When Jin Shengtan was about to be executed, he said, "Killing is a painful thing, but I got it 'unintentionally'!" The unintentionalness in Chaplin's play is comparable to what Jin Shengtan said. Comedy is always comedy, just like the crows in the world are always black.</p>
<p>The story of "The Great Dictator", to put it simply, should be described as follows:</p>
<p>A little Jew named Hengel lives in the country of Tomannia. During the First World War, he served as a soldier on the front line. Due to the shock of the artillery fire and the panic of the plane explosion, he became a person with complete memory loss, unable to speak clearly, and half-crazy with heart disease. At that time, a dictator in his country, named Adenoid Hynkel (also played by Chaplin, with the same name as the barber), gradually gained power and seized all power. Hengel was fortunate to suffer from "mental loss", so he did not feel pain for all the facilities of the dictator. After returning home from the army, he worked as a barber. Because he offended the dictator's stormtroopers, he was arrested by the government. At this time, the dictator's favorite adjutant, Stilz, had been helped by Hengel in the war, and finally repaid his kindness with virtue and did not arrest him.</p>

<h3>Police Translator Zhao Anda Steals Head Constable's Gun - Recovered by Search Team on Chengdu Road</h3>
<p>Martin, the Western head constable of the Jiaxing Road Police Station, hung his official handgun with its leather case in the police station office on the evening of the 18th of this month. Unexpectedly, the gun suddenly disappeared the next morning. At that time, the police station authorities believed that since outsiders could not freely enter and exit the office, it must have been done by someone in the police station. They arrested Wan Ruqin from Anhui and Fu Jiaxi from Nanjing, two coolies, on suspicion and sent them to the Special Court for interrogation and detention. It is now learned that the actual criminal in this case has been apprehended by the police station, and the handgun and six bullets have also been recovered. The criminal's name is Zhao Anda, only nineteen years old, registered in Nanjing, and works as a translator at the Jiaxing Road Police Station (his father is a police detective). He lives at No. 3, Lane 103, Guling Road. After stealing the gun and bullets, he planned to sell them. At 9:30 PM the night before, he took the gun to hand it over, but because the price was not right, he brought it back to his residence. Unexpectedly, while passing near No. 741, Chengdu Road, he was found by a police station search team and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Fourth Criminal Division of the Special Court. Police station lawyer Peng Qiqi stated the case, saying that the two police station clerks, Zhao and Fu, who were previously arrested had no relationship to this case and requested that their detention be revoked. However, Fu Jiaxi had another incident of stealing a police officer's whistle award, which must be prosecuted separately. When Zhao Anda was questioned, he confessed to the charges. The court ruled that Zhao Yuqin would be released first, and Zhao Anda would be detained until the 27th to be tried together with Fu Jiaxi.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Morning's Constable Confrontation with Robbers on Route Ghisi - One Robber Dies from Serious Injuries - One Constable Injured in the Leg</h3>
<p>At 7:45 AM yesterday morning, three robbers suddenly broke into the home of a Zhang family, a Ningbo cotton cloth merchant, at No. 10, Zhilan Lane, Route Ghisi, French Concession. Two of the robbers had handguns. They entered through the back door and robbed 2,000 yuan in cash and two gold rings before fleeing. At that time, a certain Mr. A, a tenant of the Zhang family, secretly followed behind. Seeing the three robbers fleeing eastward, he reported to Chinese Constable No. 154 at the intersection of Route Wagner and Rue Marcel. The constable then blew his whistle and chased after them. The two robbers knew that things were not going well, so they fled towards Rue Min Teni Yin and the Great World. At that time, Chinese Constable No. 283, a three-wheeled police officer from the French Police Station, was patrolling the area. Upon hearing the alarm, he got off his motorcycle and chased after the robbers. At that time, the traffic light in the middle of Avenue Edward VII was green, opening up north-south traffic, so the robbers were able to cross Avenue Edward VII. In an instant, two robbers disappeared. Only one robber, wearing a gray striped suit and with a short stature, fled eastward and turned around to shoot at the constable to resist arrest. The constables also returned fire, and a series of gunshots were fired, totaling more than ten shots. Pedestrians fled in panic. The robber then fled into the hot spring bathhouse at the corner of Avenue Edward VII and Yunnan Road. Chinese Constable No. 553 from the Public Concession, who was also there, also fired his gun to block his path. As a result, the robber was attacked from both sides and was shot three times in the chest, abdomen, and feet. Due to the critical injuries, he immediately fell to the ground and died. Chinese Constable No. 553 was also shot in the right foot by the robber's bullet. At that time, both the French and Public Concession police stations had received the news and sent police cars and detectives to the scene. The injured constable was sent to the police hospital, and the dead robber was sent to Renji Hospital. The Public Concession Police Station then transferred the dead robber and a six-inch Browning handgun seized from the dead robber to the French Police Station for handling.</p>
<h3>Extorting a Flour Shop Owner - Two Criminals Arrested</h3>
<p>The Ruiji Flour Shop at No. 122 North Zhejiang Road was founded by Pan Ruijie, a native of Luodian. Between the 7th and 14th of this month, he suddenly received three threatening letters from a gang and a basket of apples containing a hand grenade. The second letter contained two bullets, demanding 50,000 yuan and urging payment by phone up to six times. Pan was disturbed by these people and secretly reported to the police. At about 4:00 PM on the 21st, Hua Detective Shang Wu and Detective Li Dacheng, who were handling the case, arrested Gu Xiaodi, a native of Pudong, and Yu Yutang, a native of Ningbo, near Yuyuan Road, Jing'an Temple Road, while they were telephoning the victim to go to a certain place to negotiate the payment. A piece of paper with the words "Received 1,300 yuan" was found on Gu's body. Both were taken to the Huisi Police Station for detention and escorted to the First Special Court yesterday morning. Police Station lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the case and requested a postponement. Judge Huang Risheng questioned the two defendants and ordered them to be remanded in custody and rescheduled for further verification.</p>
<h3>Mahjong Shop Employee - Punished for Private Business</h3>
<p>Miao Jinbao, a native of Anhui, was an employee of the Zhang Rongxing Mahjong Shop at No. 710 Guangdong Road. He was dismissed on September 1 of this year. On October 5, a customer surnamed Jie came to the shop to urge the delivery of a confirmed order, saying that he had paid a deposit of more than 1,500 yuan on August 28 and September 9, respectively, and had receipts, etc. The shop then discovered that the receipts were stamped with the shop's seal by Miao Jinbao while he was in office. He had secretly received the payments, continuously embezzled them, and failed to report them to the accounts, intending to engage in private business. The shop entrusted lawyer Huang Renda of Yide Heng Law Firm to file a complaint with the First Special Court, accusing Miao of stealing the seal and breach of trust, and requesting investigation and prosecution. The case was heard by the judge the other day. Defendant Miao Jinbao initially tried to deny it, but after witness Jie was summoned to court to testify, Miao finally admitted that he was engaging in private business. Judge Xiao then concluded the trial and sentenced Miao Jinbao to a fine of 120 yuan for breach of trust. If he could not pay, he would be sentenced to labor service, with two yuan equivalent to one day.</p>
<h3>Suspicious Man - Handgun and Bullets Seized</h3>
<p>At 2:15 PM yesterday afternoon, officers from the Public Concession Police Department were inspecting pedestrians on Guangdong Road, Henan Road, when they saw a man passing by the entrance of Yongning Lane. He looked quite panicked. They immediately ordered him to stop and seized a handgun and five bullets from his body. He was taken to the police station for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Maid Abused - Fine Imposed</h3>
<p>Li Shenshi, a native of Ningbo who previously worked as a hostess, lives at No. 407 Siwen Lane, Datong Road. In May, she spent 26 yuan to buy a nine-year-old girl, Xu Ayu, as her adopted daughter. However, she was quite violent by nature and made Xu work all day long. Whenever she was slightly dissatisfied, she would often beat her, causing her head and buttocks to be severely injured. Xia Li, the wife of the second landlord, witnessed this and could not bear it, so she reported it to the Xinzha Police Station. Detective Yuan Yao was dispatched to arrest Li Shenshi and bring her to the police station. Yesterday morning, she was escorted to the First Special Court. Police Station lawyer Li Zhishan filed a lawsuit according to law. After questioning by the judge, Li Shenshi was sentenced to a fine of 60 yuan, and the girl was sent to the Jiliang Institute for food and lodging.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Issues Order Strictly Prohibiting - High-Interest Loans in Rural Areas</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that usury has long been strictly prohibited, the Ministry of Finance has learned that there are now those who are taking advantage of the war to create ingenious names and exploit farmers again. In some cases, the interest within one year even exceeds the principal, and in others, the interest reaches more than 10%. Farmers are in urgent need of funds to purchase fertilizers and seeds, and are forced to drink poison to quench their thirst. There are also local bullies colluding with uncooperative Baojia chiefs, requiring that all borrowers must be introduced and certified by the Baojia chief, and the Baojia chief must take a commission from the borrowed funds as an introduction and certification fee. This kind of high-interest loan is illegal. In addition to consulting with the provincial governments to investigate and ban it, the Ministry of Finance also ordered the Central Trust of China, the Bank of Communications, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the Provincial Banks in the four provinces to expand agricultural loans as much as possible in accordance with the outline of agricultural loans, so as to protect the development of the rural economy. Debtors are allowed to accuse and punish unqualified Baojia chiefs who collude in exploitation or illegal detention according to law.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I recently read in the newspaper about a shooting at the Dasanxing Restaurant on Fuzhou Road during a wedding of someone surnamed Lu, stating that the Lu was the owner of Wanli Rice Company. We have checked and there is no such person in our company, nor any shareholder surnamed Lu. We fear this is misinformation. We are sending this letter in order to correct this news. Respectfully, to the Editor of Shen Bao. Wanli Rice Company</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>

<h3>The Success and Failure of Banquets</h3>
<p>In social circles, holding banquets is a very common occurrence, whether at home or in restaurants. Indeed, banquets can allow us to make many friends and conduct social business.</p>
<p>Before holding a banquet, there are many things to do. First, we must decide on the location of the banquet. If our home is furnished quite cleanly, then we can hold it at home, which is not only cheaper, but also allows guests to have more fun. Otherwise, we can hold it in a restaurant.</p>
<p>Second, we must decide on the list of invitees and send out invitations within a few days. At the same time, we must also decide whether it will be a tea party, a luncheon, or a dinner party.</p>
<p>On the day of the banquet, it is best to notify each invitee so that they can all arrive. Then, various arrangements such as the dining table, furnishings, and the guests' entertainment problems must also be prepared.</p>
<p>If we are hosting, we must make every guest feel well taken care of, which requires sufficient and lively spirit.</p>
<p>During the meal, fluent and lively conversation can often make the banquet very colorful. We must be clear and careful, which requires a lot of energy.</p>
<p>After eating, we must provide each guest with a considerable amount of time, a table, or, or appreciate a few interesting books, start, or play.</p>
<p>In short, the success or failure of a banquet depends on the host's attentive hospitality and the guests' attitude.</p>
<p>If we suffer from headaches, toothaches, rheumatism, or menstrual pain, we cannot make the banquet a success.</p>
<p>Suppose we are anxious to see, take some bad painkillers, and then have a reaction, what will happen?</p>
<p>This problem is easy to solve. The easiest and safest method of pain relief is to take Sanli Tong. Swallow one or two tablets, and the pain will stop in ten minutes. No matter how severe the pain is, it can be stopped, and because the medicine is gentle, there are no side effects.</p>
<p>Sanli Tong is manufactured by Swiss Competition Meng Ji Co., Ltd. The medicines manufactured by the company are very reliable, so when pain occurs in an emergency, Sanli Tong can be used to solve the immediate problem.</p>

<h3>In My Position</h3>
<p>— Zhi Yu</p>
<p>It seems that God is deliberately making things difficult for us. Today, we encountered the promotional work of the safety movement, but it unceremoniously started to drizzle.</p>
<p>It was half past seven, and I hurried to the school without an umbrella to collect the "Safety First" armband. I ran into the school office, but it was deserted, with not a single person there. Indeed, it was too early, not even eight o'clock yet! After a few minutes, students came in twos and threes. The office clock also chimed eight times, but the office staff had not yet arrived.</p>
<p>"It's eight o'clock, and it's time for us to go on duty. Why haven't the armbands been distributed yet!" a student asked impatiently.</p>
<p>"Mr. × is still asleep. How can he distribute them?" another student replied.</p>
<p>"Wait a minute! Don't grumble. Be careful when he comes," the class leader kindly advised.</p>
<p>After about ten minutes of such discussion, Mr. × came swaggering in, with a cigar in his mouth and a roll of red armbands in his hand. He also mumbled, "It doesn't matter. There won't be too many people in the morning. It doesn't matter if it's a few minutes late." Although, he clearly knew that he was not keeping to time.</p>
<p>Because it was already past the time to go on duty, we had to rush to our posts. The work began in this way.</p>
<p>Our post—Aiguo Road—was quite lively. At first, those sacred laborers came and went, including salt sellers carrying bags and vegetable girls carrying burdens. When they saw us, they thought we were "special patrolmen" and were afraid that we would take them to the "union." So, they ran away as if they were flying before we could open our mouths. They were extremely afraid of being "caught" by the patrolmen.</p>
<p>More and more pedestrians came. I handed out leaflets to them one by one.</p>
<p>Some people thought we were selling "elixirs." When they saw us approaching, they immediately said "no" and left. When we explained to them, they gave us a "white eye." Among them, most were neatly dressed "gentlemen."</p>
<p>When we handed out leaflets to fashionable ladies or young women, they often arrogantly ignored us and continued their "wonderful" pace. Perhaps they were unwilling to stretch out their jade hands from their coat pockets to accept this "worthless" piece of paper!</p>
<p>After running into forty or fifty "unlucky" encounters in a row, I was really angry. I stood there blankly, letting the rain wash away the gloom in my heart! Suddenly, a hand as black as lacquer stretched out in front of my eyes. I was startled by it, and when I raised my head to look, it turned out to be a worker of about twenty years old wearing dirty blue overalls, his face as black as the "Darkie Toothpaste" trademark, carrying quite heavy iron blocks on his back, asking me for a leaflet.</p>
<p>"Sir, excuse me, give me one."</p>
<p>"Walk...ing...must...be...sure...to...on the road...", I gave him one, and he stopped and read it word by word in a low voice.</p>
<p>"Are you not very literate?" I heard him read the word "along" as "lead," so I asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, I have never been to school, alas..."</p>
<p>"I'll read it to you," I volunteered to read all the words on the leaflet to him.</p>
<p>"Thank you, you are really...great, you are all young masters, and you are still serving the community on such a rainy day. It's a pity that I'm illiterate and can't...Hey! I should go. Can I take this paper to show my friends?" he said a lot in such a discontinuous manner with gratitude.</p>
<p>I was stunned again. It was not until Kun Jun called me that I realized this loyal friend had left.</p>
<p>Although it was only five or six minutes of conversation, I had already received great comfort from this friend. I knew that every word he said came from his pure heart. I was moved by him! The fire of just now had long subsided.</p>
<p>The time had come, and I reluctantly left the post—because it had given me great comfort there—and returned home in the drizzle.</p>

<h3>The Danc Queen's Denouement</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Eleven Zhao Boxiong's Confession</p>
<p>I took the opportunity to express my opinion. "This old man looks very much like a moralist on the surface. I didn't expect him to use such a vicious method."</p>
<p>Hawthorn opened his eyes and looked at me, saying with emotion, "This is undoubtedly the magic of money that tempted him. However, he is just a hypocrite. His cultivation must not be sufficient. Otherwise, Mencius said, 'Wealth and rank cannot corrupt him.' These petty trinkets, rings, and earrings certainly cannot bewitch his mind. When I talked to him, I was also deceived by his mask, believing that he was an old-fashioned gentleman. Therefore, I even believed that the fake ivory cigarette holder he accidentally left on the desk when he committed the crime was something he left behind while reading the newspaper after dinner. Bao Lang, this is my mistake. I was deceived by him. In fact, from the cigarette holder, I measured his personality. Apart from the fact that smoking the cigarette to the end showed that he was excessively frugal, the intact preservation of the cigarette holder also showed that he was a careful and cautious person. However, when he deliberately forgot the cigarette holder when he walked out of the guest room at the end of the conversation, it also showed that he was a careless and forgetful person. This action was clearly completely contrary to my previous inference. I didn't even think of it immediately at the time, which shows that the sharpness of my mind is indeed gradually declining with age!" He sighed along with it.</p>
<p>I said, "It's no wonder you. His art of disguise is indeed very clever. As Jinmei said, he was the first to advocate reporting to the police station after the incident. He also seemed to indicate that Wang Lilan's life was somewhat self-inflicted. He seemed to be at a loss about her death, and he did not try to exculpate himself by pointing out other suspects. In short, his actions, attitude, and words were indeed not easy to make people suspicious."</p>
<p>Hawthorn shook his head and said, "No, in the conversation, he seemed to be very pure and dissatisfied with Lilan's behavior. In fact, after thinking about it carefully later, his purity also came from hypocrisy. You think, he came once in the autumn of the year before last. Since he was dissatisfied with Lilan's life and actions and believed that Shanghai was a dirty city, then why did he come again? And why did he still live in the house of his niece whom he was dissatisfied with?"</p>
<p>I nodded. "Then, what assumptions have you made about his actual assassination actions?"</p>
<p>Hawthorn said, "His steps of action, I think you can hear him say it himself in a while. There is no need for me to explain it indirectly, because I will be somewhat detached when I speak. However, the reason why my attention was focused on him and then determined that it was him, the key lies in that A print. I remembered that I had seen a pair of slippers left by Lu Jiansheng in the guest room, so I thought that perhaps there was also a pair of leather shoes left in the house for Li Zhifan to use. Just now, when I went to the police station alone, I asked you to go to Lilan's house to talk to Li Zhifan first. My purpose was to ask you to find a way to detain him downstairs so that I could quietly go to his room to search for Lu Jiansheng's pair of black leather shoes. Later, you also saw that I did find the pair of leather shoes in Lilan's room. You also told me about Li Shouqi's attempted rape, and my idea was completely confirmed. (174)</p>

<h3>Film Queen — Bette Davis</h3>
<p>— Qinghui</p>
<p>Bette Davis, who was elected as this year's film queen in Hollywood, is not an actor, a star, but a talented female artist. She exchanged her superb acting skills for this noble honor. No matter what kind of role she plays, she can perform it vividly and incisively. Moreover, she is as beautiful as a fish or a wild goose, and as shy as a flower behind the moon. When she smiles, she is like a hibiscus in the wind; when she cries, she is like a begonia in the rain. It is most appropriate to describe her with flowers. Let's stop the small talk and get back to the topic:</p>
<p>Work-Study</p>
<p>On April 5, 1908, her mother traveled to Lowell, and because of overwork, she gave birth to a girl who was less than ten months old. She was Bette. Not long after she was born, her parents announced their divorce, and Bette lived with her mother. Poor her, she was often sick in her childhood and spent her happy girlhood in misery. Later, because of the poverty of the family, she had to serve in the school to provide for her tuition. She studied day and night, and in this way, she completed her studies.</p>
<p>Won Awards Twice</p>
<p>Of course, she does not regard hard work as an exception, but she hopes to seek a way out on Broadway or Hollywood. Finally, after a year of hard work, she was arranged to play a supporting role in a film, but the result was a failure. This film almost closed her out of the film industry. However, she had great confidence. Finally, she played the main role in the film "Dangerous", and won the Academy Award in one fell swoop. In 1938, she won the award again for "Jezebel". The current public screening in Shanghai of "The Great Lie" is another success of hers. It seems that she, this film queen, is most likely to win this year's Academy Award.</p>
<p>Loves Poetry</p>
<p>In her private life, Bette has a very strong love for poetry. She not only likes to read, but also often picks up a pen to write. She not only writes, but also often publishes in magazines. "Arnoux Mace" is her pseudonym. Romance is the demeanor of a poet, but this female poet, on the contrary, she works very seriously, even more seriously than ordinary female workers. She arrives at the company at 8:00 in the morning and does not return home until 8:00 in the evening. Who can stay in the workplace for so long like her? Therefore, many people wonder why she has to work so hard. Sometimes she herself is surprised, but the habit remains unchanged. The least happy thing in her life is having nothing to do, a period of just looking for joy all day long.</p>
<p>Admires China</p>
<p>You may be surprised. Bette Davis is a female star who admires China. She once said this: "Since I was a child, I knew that there was such a powerful and invincible China in the Far East. It contains countless mineral raw materials, towering high mountains, and winding rivers. However, the people there do not rely on high mountains and deep rivers as natural barriers, and fertile lands as a source of life. They rely on the outstanding spirit of perseverance and endurance and are now fighting against the invaders in self-defense in order to seek permanent glorious peace. From this we can know how great and bright China is."</p>
<h3>Good News for Zhang Junqiu and Mao Shilai</h3>
<p>— Magpie</p>
<p>Married one after another — ten days apart</p>
<p>In the capital's opera world, there have been two major events recently, that is, two of the four little famous dan — Zhang Junqiu and Mao Shilai, are both getting married! Zhang Junqiu is marrying Zhao Yankui's daughter, and the wedding is scheduled for today (the 23rd) at Fushoutang. Junqiu was recently invited by Tianjin China Grand Theater to perform, and only rushed back to Beiping five days before the wedding. Mao Shilai's fiancée is Liu Binsheng's adopted sister, also surnamed Liu, and the wedding is scheduled for December 3, at Cuihualou. After Zhang Junqiu returned to Ping from Tianjin, Mao Shilai went to Tianjin after Zhang Junqiu, also at the invitation of China Grand Theater, and also decided to rush back to Beiping five days before the wedding. This is already a coincidence, and the wedding locations of the two families: Fushoutang and Cuihualou, are also both in the East City, only dozens of steps apart. This is another coincidence. In addition, the wedding ceremonies of both families are using old-fashioned flag umbrellas and canopies, and the sedan chairs are contracted by Hengtai Wedding Sedan Shop. This is even more of a coincidence. (Posted from Beiping on November 18)</p>
<h3>Yan Qiu and Zhen Fei</h3>
<p>— Meng Yu</p>
<p>Since Xue Yanqin and others left, Xin Yanqiu has become the leader of female performers, and many latecomers cannot match her. Xinling's learning process has a great resemblance to her. My late friend Bu Linyu had great expectations and once sent a poem to Xinling saying: "Although my darling is growing day by day, I always mention you in my mouth." Xinling is also Linyu's adopted daughter. This time in Shanghai, there will not be many performances. I also happened to be in another city, and after returning, I only got to watch her play Wang Baochuan. I could not enjoy her wonderful performance, but one glimpse is enough to get a general idea of the rest. Moreover, Xinling is graceful and has the demeanor of a great family. Her portrayal of Wang Baochuan makes her strengths even more evident. The cloth skirt and hairpin are purely natural, without any traces of artificiality. I cannot help but sigh at the perfection. This time, the most outstanding supporting actor is Yu Zhenfei. Zhenfei is also an old friend. More than ten years ago, Zhenfei often came to my residence on holidays. At that time, he was still a famous amateur with a heroic spirit, unparalleled for a time. This reminds me of my late friend and famous qin player Lu Jun. Zhenfei took care of me, and Lu often came with him. The other famous amateurs were also friendly with Lu. Every time they sang, it was even more wonderful with Lu playing the qin. Now the grass on the grave has grown, and looking back on the past, I am sad and shed tears. I believe Zhenfei must also have the same feeling!</p>
