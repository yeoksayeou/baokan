<h3 id="c5">歐戰擴大與上海前途 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>英法聯軍甫以苦戰退出佛蘭德區，義大利的參戰問題又達到如箭什弦的形勢，國際大局顯然正在逆境之中繼續開展；此後兵連禍結，變亂相續，其影響與歸宿實非目前所能臆斷。因之，日來孤島人心亦見動盪；上海一隅的前途與安全顯已成爲人們最感關切的一個問題。</p>
<p>其實，這並不是個新的問題，三年以來，上海人士至少有過兩决同樣的經騐：蘇台德區的糾紛，西歐戰事的爆發，都曾使上海空氣一度趨於緊張。然而那兩决的危機，都是瞬即消釋，因之人們也除却　心情上經歷了一些波動而外，似乎並未能深刻領受其意義和敎訓。繼之而起的倒是投機與囤積的盛行，追求個人利慾的行徑達到空前高峯。而國家民族所正經歷着的神聖偉業，則因爲時間的悠久與空間的遠隔而漸次在人們的意識上冲淡。最近因爲歐戰擴大而又重新感到對上海前途的關切，其實這不過是華軍退出淞滬後一個舊的問題的擴大和延續而已。</p>
<p>就以往兩度事變和目前來比較，當以一九二八秋天的日方態度最爲囂張。當張伯倫兩度飛往貝許伽登的時候，滬上局面也隨着歐陸而空前嚴重起來，彼時日閥似乎只等歐局決裂消息到來，便立即對上海試其鋒銳。到去秋歐戰爆發，日方雖也曾向英法要求撒退駐華軍隊，姿態已相當和緩，且當英法不予考慮之後也就相安於無形，別無重大的變化。及至最近，日方輿論固極龐雜，其軍政當局則異常持重，直到目前尚無露骨的表示。這種態度上的變化，自然未便驟即斷爲代表着日方行動方面的動向，却可看出日閥由俞拔弩張逐决變爲小心翼翼的趨勢。而決定日閥這一變化者不是旁的，正是日方在侵華一役中所遭受的挫折與敎訓。設使歐戰是什一九三五—三六之交爆發，那不要說一個彈丸之地的上海，恐怕所有列强在遠東的屬領都會被三宅坂的英雄們看成囊中物。又假如中國抗戰不幸而中途失敗或妥協，則上海的中立局勢也絕不會組持到三年。所以上海一隅的前途，絕不能與整個的抗戰分離開去觀察單從局部情勢講：上海在最近期間容或不致發生何種意外。因爲列强對於維持上海現狀固具決心；旬日以前美艦隊司令赫德也曾對滬上局勢，作未雨綢繆的措置。一個宗邦已全歸淪陷的荷屬東印，日閥縱已饞涎欲滴，且不敢輕事妄動，則此度義大利縱即牽入歐戰漩渦、上海的安全也未必立即遭受何等驚擾。但是進一步來看：國際局勢旣在繼續惡化之中，全世界任何一個角落都未必獨能躱避到整個的洪鑪以外。丹麥挪威荷蘭比利時那一個不是與世無爭的獨立國家，竟都逃不脫遭受侵襲奴役的噩運，假使歐戰再繼續擴大，正不知將更牽連若干無辜的人民與國家。而同時一個正以抗戰謀解放的民族，其一部國民反而斤斤於自身生命財產的安全，這不能不算爲一種錯覺。藉令退一步講，上海獨能長此實身於一切禍亂之外，形成變相的桃源，試問在全世界的干戈擾攘之中，一個自身不能生產的孤島及其居民，又何以繼續維持其生存？須知上海四五百萬人民的休戚，並不僅繫於孤島一地的命運，與國際形勢的變化，主要還要看中國抗建大業的前途。如果暫時把目前這一烏煙瘴氣的環境拋開，轉而看看自由中國的大後方，那一切太可樂觀了！三年來的苦戰，已把沉埋已久的民族精神和元氣磨鍊煥發，在任何方面都顯出蓬勃馥郁的現象。有如日機的殘酷轟炸，也許會引起人們想像中的戰慄；而事實上，無論在都市或鄕鎭，那只激起籌愾和復興精神，絕不像日軍發言人所希望，會使華人的抵抗精神歸於毀滅。而且往往轟炸一過，一面淸除瓦礫，一面就奠立新基從事改建，據說有若千城市已因遭過轟炸而面目一新。這正是充分表現了中華人民百折不回的毅力，並且也象徵着民族復興的前途。再就軍事方面來看：最近英法比聯軍與德車作戰，雙方軍備在伯仲之間，戰局竟成一面倒之勢；而中國軍事裝備之劣，較之日軍幾無比例可言，倒能和日軍相持到三年，且一再挫敗日軍的機械部隊和閃電戰略。這又是何等使人興奮並且加强信心的事。所以如果僅爲一已近利着想，也許竟會感覺到處都是絕路；但若着眼於民族前途的遠景，則無往而不是光明。明乎此，人們實不必惠葸以孤島一隅的安危爲慮，只有把人力物力都貢之祖國以促進抗戰勝利的提早到臨，纔是保障個人利益的無上出路。</p>

<p>余於一九三八年一月杪被召返回國，聆取訓令，俾與希特勒進行談判。如以德報論調，及希特勒偶向英人方面吐露者爲判斷，則英德障碍厥有兩端，一即英國在歐洲所採取之反德政策，一即拒絕交還自德人手中「攫奪」之殖民地是也。余奉命通知希特勒，謂英國政府在原則上準備商討一切懸案。</p>
<p>二月四日返任。見空氣不佳，乃延期至三月三日始訪希特勒。其時哈里法克斯勛爵已繼艾登任外相。是日造舊總理府，承延坐於靠墻對窗之大沙發。余左爲德外交部譯員希密特博士。再左，成半圓形，希特勒坐於圓手靠椅，面對余而坐其旁者則爲外交部長里本特洛甫。余陳述請見意旨後，即謂余之來意，並非爲討價還價。英國政府深知前途荊棘良多，但亦確信，如雙方能以互惠爲基礎，並以更高尚之原則，代替武力，所有困難，亦不難迎刃而解。現狀可予變更，但當以更高尚之理由爲根據。兩國間亟須檢討者，即爲縮减軍備，限制轟炸，（英國政府尚望廢除轟炸機）及和平解決捷奧及殖民地問題是也。余之所欲知者，　德國於維護歐洲和平準備作何貢獻耳。</p>
<p>此或爲余對希特勒自來最長之陳述，歷時當有十分鐘之久。彼蜷縮椅中靜聽，面貌猙獰，時露不豫之色。惟余之語氣，　堅決而緩和，希特勒此種表情，大可不必。余陳說畢，希特勒即發言曰，非至英國報紙停止攻擊，實無能爲力。（每次談話，彼必重伸此說。）第三國干涉中歐事件，亦爲其所不能容忍。德人數百萬遭遇不公平之待遇。自決與自治權，德人應與其他民族同樣享受。奧人擁戴許士尼格政府者，不過百分之十五。英國茍反對合理的解決方式，則德人惟武力是視。當地德僑如遭壓迫，彼必以迅雷不及掩耳之手段，出而干涉。奧國必須舉行公民投票，以決定誰屬，捷克境內之日耳愛族居民應在文化及其他方面，獲得自治權。</p>
<p>彼對殖民地問題，不感興趣。半小時內，彼所叨叨不絕者，無非爲英國報紙之攻擊，英主敎之干與德敎會事件，及英國之干涉各種事件，（由希特勒　之，此種事件，初與英國無涉）。以及捷奧境內國社主義派日軍曼人之遭　虐待而已。旋復談及軍縮問題，並稱法蘇互助協定及捷克之强盛，均爲一種對德威脅。職是之故，德國軍備，不得不大加擴充，任何軍縮問題之討論，要以蘇聯爲轉移。事之最感困難者厥爲「有人竟信任化外的蘇聯所訂之條約。須知蘇聯所訂任何條約，絕無價值可言，該國決不能任其踏進歐洲」。即以禁止使用毒瓦斯言，欲令蘇俄永矢勿渝，孰能信之。</p>
<p>余與希特勒會談約兩小時之久，其間里本特洛甫對於英國報紙態度，曾向希特勒貢獻某種意見。余即詰之曰，以僑居加拿大多年，且曾出使英國之人，如此不懂英國人心理習慣，殊屬駭人聽聞。時希特勒之於里本特洛甫，尚未如日後之言聽計從，對余反駁，因尚能瞭解。</p>
<p>三月十一日晚，戈林在航空協會舉行盛大宴舞會，嘉賓盈千。余亦被邀參加。各方紛紛議論奧國問題。時有人持電報授余，促與牛賴特談話。一時全塲肅靜無聲，明眼二千隻，視綫集余一身。無何，戈林至，與余等握手爲禮，殊落漠。坐定後，撕下半張節目單，草草以鉛筆作一短簡，授由美大使夫人交余，上書曰「樂終願獲一談，並解釋一切。」最後五字下，且劃有橫綫三。余伺機隨戈林出大廳。嗣後三刻鐘，羣相猜測，不知發生何事矣。</p>
<p>余二人會談於戈林私室，殊不歡洽。戈林斥責奧德總理許士尼格無信義，　除目下辦法外，並無他途可循。旋余獲悉，德陸空軍已越過邊境，奧國已被併吞矣。</p>
<p>余爲許士尼格辯護，口敝唇焦始已。最後謂戈林曰，「縱使奧德總理爲不智，德人亦不能藉此用兵。」旋余又相機力促戈林，勿害反國社黨派奧人。比返大廳，余復向戈林進一言，茍不欲希特勒獲悉英國民衆對此反響，莫若於二星期內勿使希特勒寓目英報。</p>
<p>至此，尚有一事，不能不紀。三月十三日爲德方歐洲陣亡將士紀念日。各國代表均依例參加紀念禮，余則以德奧事件，血未乾刀，謝絕參加。且爲表示絃外之音起見，反往拜會奧使。余以汽車往，車頭挿有英國國旗。余到達之時，見奧使全副軍裝，正擬赴紀念會。事後聞人言，奧使曾在會行國社黨敬禮，且曾隨衆高呼希特勒萬歲焉。</p>
<p>自是厥後，捷克問題告緊，張伯倫首相始則飛往貝許得斯加登，繼則飛往戈得斯堡，最後至慕尼克。余於首相僕僕風塵，不欲妄加評斷，留待他日史家之批判可耳。當時一部份人，不自量力，且不願拒絕蘇台德區自決權之道義的立塲如何，率以爲我人對付一九三八年九月希特勒虛聲恫嚇之舉爲失策，此則余以爲完全錯誤。須知僅僅以「否」之一字對付獨裁者，於事何補。當時余曾謂，「欲謀對付希特勒之恫嚇，唯有準備担當一切後果。」當時法國有此準備耶，遑論英國。</p>
<p>張伯倫首相既已決定與希特勒面談，即於一九三八年九月十五日晨八時半，自倫敦啟程，四小時後，飛抵慕尼克。是晨，余乘火車往迎。首相以六十九歲之高年，車舟勞頓者十小時後，復與里本特洛甫及希特勒晤談甚久，並以經過　形電告倫敦。忙碌終日，日夜十一時始寢。自稱飭骨堅强，信不誣也。</p>
<p>是日下午四時許抵達貝許得斯加登，入逆旅稍憩。俄而驅車至希特勒山居別墅。希特勒降階歡迎。進茶時，閒談約二十分鐘。希特勒即邀張伯倫於其書室中談話。</p>
<p>余雅不願里本特洛甫側身其間。會談紀錄由里本特洛甫保管，竟違反常例，未予張伯倫過目致使首相感受諸多不便，而於後來談話時爲尤甚。所幸以後數次談話，威爾　士多在塲，即余亦有時參予其間也。</p>
<p>首次談話歷三小時之久。希特勒表示，和平談判，應以承認蘇台德區日耳曼人自決權爲基礎。張氏承認此項原則，但須商由內閣通過，及獲得法捷兩國政府之同意。希特勒至此尤約期再談。</p>
<p>翌晨，張伯倫乘飛機返倫敦。即召任錫曼爵士（英國派往捷克之非正式調停專員）由捷返英商討。而法總理外長則於九月十八日抵倫敦。英法兩政府爲維護和平，及維持捷克之重要利益起見，即會同勸告捷克不但承認蘇台德區自決權，並無需公民投票，即以日耳曼人佔百分之五十以上之土地，割歸德國焉。</p>

<p>今日爲林文忠公在廣州虎門焚燒鴉片紀念日、經中央規定爲禁烟節、政府當局、爲貫澈禁烟政策、振奮民族精神、曾通令全國限期禁絕、各地雷厲　行、頗著成效、乃滬市自國軍西撤後、竟然毒氛瀰漫、烟禍猖獗、故本市各界、值此禁烟節　、莫不深切警惕、決定遵從國策、一致推行拒毒運動、勸告親友、凡染有烟毒者、希望從速猛省、立即戒絕、俾節省無謂消耗、恢復健全體魄、又滬市黨部·三民主義靑年團·上海支團部·民族大同豐·立穗社等、均發表告民衆書、玆分錄如下、</p>
<p>巿黨部發　告民衆書</p>
<p>上海特別巿黨部為六三禁烟紀念、告本市且衆略稱、今天是六三禁烟紀念日、同時是六年禁烟計劃期滿之年、我們知道、前英國心理學家霍爾曾經先後說過、「不能以三等體格的國民、造成第一等的國家」、「有了體格的黃金時代、三十年後、必有一　文化的黃金時代」、</p>
<p>健康關係　國族强弱</p>
<p>這短短的幾句話、充分地說明健康是國家强弱的關鍵、當我們現在全力抗戰的時候、尤其應該珍重我們的健康、養精蓄銳、爲國家民族而奮鬬、而努力、而犧牲、再接再厲、表現其潛在的力量、和環伺四周的惡魔作不斷的搏戰奮鬬、我們必須了解在暴的風雨、正在孤島激盪着、悖理的壓迫、和慘酷的摧殘、正在接踵而來、我們要抗禦掙扎、我們要完成抗建的使命、責任何等重大、</p>
<p>拒毒務本　拒毒務盡</p>
<p>要是我們沒有堅強的體魄、一切的一切、就會給我們斷送不要說發揚我大中華文化爲黃金時代爲不可能、即保存我華夏、四千餘年的歷史、亦屬疑問、所以我們在今天六月三日的一天、尤其在今天禁烟六年計劃期滿之年、我們更應該牢記下面兩句、「拒毒務本」、和「拒毒務盡」、的話、</p>
<p>不吸鴉片　不販毒品</p>
<p>明白些說、拒毒要從根本做起、拒毒要求盡絕、不容我們有絲毫的疏忽、不容我們有些微的懈怠、我們不僅從此不吸鴉片、並且從此不販賣任何毒品、我們不僅自己不販賣任何毒品、並且對於破壞我們禁烟計劃的陰謀、更要給他迎頭痛擊、粉碎無遣、我們必須這樣、才算拒毒問題澈底解決、我全市市民、本此精神、爲今後粉碎陰謀的先聲、擁護中央、服從總裁、切實做去、創造氣象蓬勃的大中華、</p>
<p>三靑團發　告靑年書</p>
<p>三民主義靑年團上海支團部發告全市靑年書云、全市親愛的靑年們、當一八三九年的六月三日、就是一百另一年前的今日、湖廣總督林文忠公、在虎門焚燬販運入口的鴉片二萬箱、這是表示他禁烟的決心、（中略）</p>
<p>毒化政策　不寒而慄</p>
<p>在最近十餘年來、一方面是國民政府的嚴厲執行禁烟計劃、一方面是日本帝國主義者史積極向找國推行毒化政策、自從九一八事件之後、東北在日人統治之卞、一天利害一天的毒化了、據一九三八年日本自己所發表的偽滿烟民的數量、是一千三百萬、占了偽滿人口全數的三分之一、自從蘆溝橋事件發生後、日本逐漸的侵占了華北·華中·華南。的沿海區域、而使天津·上海·廈門·三處、做了毒化蓬北華中華南根據地、</p>
<p>決心禁毒　粉碎陰謀</p>
<p>一九三七年的八月、日軍攻陷北平後、許多監犯、都慘遭槍決、獨獨這批烟犯、完全恢復了自由、一九三八年、華北傀儡政權更公然廢止了國民政府的禁烟法規、所有華北各處的烟犯、一律釋放、這許多事實、都表徵日本帝國主義者是怎樣要充分運用毒化政策、來奴化我們的民族、來</p>
<p>民衆自己　負起責任</p>
<p>蔣總栽一再昭示我們、這一個六年禁滅亡我們的國家、但是國民政府決不因爲日本帝國主義者的武力侵路、而對禁政稍加忽略因爲毒化政策、便是日本布國主義者侵略政策的一種、我們要以武力來抵抗武力的侵略、同時我們要以禁絕烟毒的決心、來粉碎毒化的陰謀、</p>
<p>民衆自己　負起責任</p>
<p>蔣總裁一再昭示我們、這一個六年禁烟計劃、必須要貫澈、今年是禁絕烟毒的最後限期、所以在今年、我們必須要把毒氛逐出國境、不過在日本帝國主義者的侵佔區內、政府的力量、巳是不能到達、而這一個禁烟責任、更需要我們民衆自己担負起來、蔣總裁在去年的禁烟節、曾昭示我們、一我以十二萬分懇切至誠希望全國同胞、必須協助政府、實施政策、每一個人、都把禁烟認爲自己應盡的責任」、尤其靑年、尤其是上海區內的靑年、更需要切實的負起道個責任來、因爲我們深信靑年最能够抱定道個禁毒的決心、也祇有把這個禁毒的事情、從靑年身上做起、才是最澈底、</p>
<p>上海靑年　一致奮起</p>
<p>全上海的靑年們、我們要振發我們的精神、我們要堅强我們的體魄、組成一枝民族抗戰陣綫中的有力生力軍、便要絕對隔絕烟毒、我們要繼續不斷的抵抗暴力的侵略、我們要使國家民族一天天的强盛起來、我們切不可忽略了禁絕烟毒的大政、口號（一）今年是中央禁絕烟毒的最後限期、（二）烟毒是頹唐精神的工具、（三）烟毒是斵傷身體的利器、（四）烟毒是銷沉妣士的惡魔、（五）烟毒是束縛思想的桎梏、</p>
<p>各界分別　勸勉除毒</p>
<p>中華海員工會持派員辦事處、以今日爲林則徐在廣州虎門焚土日、經中央規定是日爲禁烟節、每年今日、該會必召集各輪海員開會、舉行紀念、藉資宣傳本年禁烟節、爲表示擁護中央國策、並鼓勵各輸海員對禁烟國策、有更深切之認識、與自動推行之精神起見、爰實行精神紀念辦法、由該會通告各　工友、於工餘之暇、在各輸小組會議時、分別舉行紀念、同時並頒發爲「六三」禁烟節告全國海員工友書、此外本市民族大同盟立國聯誼社等、亦均發表文告、勸勉除毒、文長從略、</p>

<p>關於越界築路交涉、自工部局總巡鮑恩提出最後建議後、偽方迄今尚無答案提出、此種若斷若續情形、前途固未許樂觀、但據昨日方傳出消息、則謂此種特別警察局」、共轉六個「分所」、經變方勝續就細目交涉月餘之久、兩者間之具體協定、至遲在六月中旬、可見諸成立、至其他懸案，如（一）封閉滬西區城之賭塲、（二）捐稅問題、（三）法院　題、「最近亦將見諸解決、」</p>
<p>「特警署」　似將成立</p>

<p>法院問題　無從妥協</p>
<p>至捐稅問題、工部局已委派總裁費利溥·副總辦葛伯·財務處長毛爾濟·與偽方交涉代表、而偽方代表尚未產生、故祇可謂準備談判、業已妥協之說、似未免過早、惟法院問題、關係中國主權、中國政府於一九三〇年一九三一年先後收回兩租界法權、與英美法荷挪巴西六國、均有協定關係、此非任何一國所可得而破壞、偽「政府」旣未經兩租界當局承認、似不能成爲交涉對手、六國間一國未能同意？少數國家亦無法與任何方面單獨交涉、美國既反對日本在遠東所造成之片面行動、各友邦及民主國家、復承認中國領土主權之獨立完整、吾人固可斷言、凡參加收回臨時法院協定之任何一國、必不致有人甘冒此大不韙、故日方之所謂「法院問題最近亦將解決、此僅一幻覺而巳、</p>

<p>（大光社）上海敎育界聯合會爲六三禁烟紀念、告本市敎育界、略稱、今天是六三禁烟紀念節、同時又是六年禁烟計劃期滿之年、我們知道吞紅丸、吸鴉片、都足以斵傷我們的身體、妨碍我們的健康、毒害我們的精神、斷送我們的前途、消滅我們整個的種族、這種可怕的後果、誠令人</p>
<p>不寒而憟</p>
<p>林公則徐、遠瞻高矚、在一百年前的今天、以大無畏精神，痛快地把二萬餘箱鴉片完全燒燬當時林則徐雖然因此削職治罪、痛遭失敗、但是烟毒是無可諱言、林則徐的偉大、也是任何人所不能否認、民國以來、雖有禁烟之議、然又徒託空言、只有我蔣委員長英明果敢、把六月三日規定爲禁烟紀念節、並且</p>
<p>限期禁絕</p>
<p>本年恰為六年禁烟計劃期滿之年、但自國軍西撤、有人肆無忌憚地、把各種毒品、運銷侵佔區域、毒害我同胞、破壞我垂成之計劃、一方面還施行其無形的毒素、戕賊我民衆心理、其爲毒實較鴉片爲更甚、一般無恥之徒、利慾薰心、</p>
<p>身受其毒而不自知、尤覺痛心、所以我仍今天紀念禁烟節意義、不僅在戒除有形的鴉片、同時還得放大其意義、傚法林則徐不屈不撓的精神、擁護中央、服從總裁、把人的陰謀、予以粉碎、我們敎育界的責任、不僅體育人材、同時還負有移風易俗爲社會楷樸的使命、更應該處先知先覺的地位、從自己做起、庶幾推己及人、一切的毒素、會掃除得乾乾凈凈云、</p>

<p>致詞</p>
<p>主席　…今天開會的動機，是由於上决申報</p>
<p>經濟專刋「上海市塲自我管理」座談曾時，大家認爲上海游資總數，至少有三十多萬萬；而這些游資，都從事於囤積貨物，購買黃金，外匯等投機事業；欲加管理，非常困難；因爲投機目的，無非是爲賺錢；僅以消極的道義的方法來勸導，是無效的；所以當時兄弟便提出指導游資正當的出路；游資獲得正當的出路，或不致冉事盲從，兄弟又以爲游資的出路之一，是經營進出口事業，可是進出口事業絕不是如投機外匯，黃金等那樣簡單；無論何人，均可盲動，提倡國際貿易，在出口方面，意在取得外匯，充實國力；在進口方面，在怎樣以最經濟方法，換取生活必需品和國貨製造必需原料品，現在歐洲情勢緊急，意大利美國均有參戰之可能；洋貨來源，更受威脅，所以我們在進口聲中，還要抓住機會，積極模仿製造，以振興我國工業。凡此種種，與生產技術，金融週轉，述輸問題，海外市塲，均有莫大的連鎖關係。道必須社會上有地位學識的人及各業先進，出來提倡領導，指示出光明的道路；一班人才能亦步亦趨，隨同前進。今天出席的都是經濟專家，各業領袖；希望由各方面不同的觀察，討論出一些良好的辦法。這不便是工商界的福利，也是對於國計民生的「個大貢獻。</p>
<p>國際貿易與國民經濟</p>
<p>主席自五月二日以來，外匯又告暴縮，故物價與各種經濟部門都起變動，又據昨日報載，外匯主管機關在重知所發表的數字，我國外匯百分之九十，是用於國際貿易，這雖不是說外匯變動，直接由於國際貿易；但誰亦不能否認其二者之間的重大關係。我國今年第一季的國際貿易，據各報所載，雖是出超；但這是根據外匯的官價計算的，如以外匯黑市價格計算，入超委實驚人。道與國民經濟的影響如何？有無補救方法，請大家討論。</p>
<p>盧志學　海關報告是出超，按市塲匯價計算是入起。</p>
<p>張—凡　國際收支上應依黑市計算。商品貿易上應以法定匯率計算，才可扣除物價影響，而研究甚供需眞相。</p>
<p>姚慶之主席　各位，兄弟想在討論本題以前，作一個開塲白；兄弟對於今天討論的題目，覺得非常有興趣。中國近十年來的經濟思想，一方面憧憬於蘇俄的社會主義，一方面則趨向於德息之法西司蒂：一般人士對於國際貿易，均希望能自給自足；這種自給自足的思想，在戰時固然是值得提倡的，但在平時都是要不得的。我們知道國際貿易，在原則上無非是國際間的分工合作，有無相通；所以各個國家與國家間。如果眞正能在平等互惠的條件之下，作合理之交易，對於雙方均是有利而無弊的。歐洲爲什麼要戰爭？是不是非戰爭便不能解決？這是值得我們注意的。穗國爲什麼要造成這一决的歐戰？其內在的原因，無非是爲了搶奪市塲及爭取原料。但是過剩的生產，如果有國際市塲，可以公尤推銷；缺乏的原料，亦可向國際市塲自　購獲。則德國至少在經濟上，實無從事侵略的必要。至於英法，他們有的是殖民地，原料易於買到，生產品易於推銷，自然感覺得滿足。但是英國自從阿太華帝國會議以後，對於英帝國的各部份實行優惠稅率；法國自從經濟恐慌以後亦實行同樣的政策。其結束使別國的貨物在英法二帝國的殖民地內，不易與英法的貨物相競爭，因位亦就缺乏購買力量，在英法二帝國的殖民地內購獲所需的原料，關於遭點，英法一國對於這决歐戰的遠因，實亦難辭其咎。總之各國如能在貿易政策上採取比較自由的態度，實爲國際和平最好的基礎。近年美國赫爾國務卿之竭力提倡互惠商的，以及最近羅斯福總統主張戰後經濟復興應以開明的貿易政策爲原則，其精意所在，亦即在此。所以兄弟以爲國際貿易，在平時應該採取比較自由的方式；經濟上的自給自足，在戰時雖應提倡，在平時是辦不到的。就是勉强辦到，也是犧牲很大，譬如德國置自然橡膠於不顧而從事於人迭橡膠，其成本反較原來爲貴，這是一般的情形。關於國際貿易的結果，發生入超是否要不得的，也值得我們加以探討。我以爲關於這一點也要分別而論。如果這種入超的原因，是爲了國家經濟發展因而利用外資，那是不要緊的，因爲外資的流入，無異就是無形貿易的出超；若果能抵過有形貿易的入超，那末國際收支仍可平衡，對外匯價仍可穩定，所以在這種情形之下，入超是根本不成問題的，但是在現在環境內的上海則不然，因爲有形貿易的入超，不但無外資的流人，可資抵補，且因資本的逃避而加劇，以致對外滙價的穩定大受威脅，這是很危險的現象。</p>
<p>第二次歐戰的發生，對於吾國國祭貿易上發生絕大變化；在以前，德國在我國進口總額上佔第三位，自歐戰爆發後、來貨很少；尤其是機器與各種化學品根本買不到，此外英法及其他歐洲交戰國或中立國的貨物進口，亦逐漸减少；所以不得不改道從美輸入，至於出口，則因法幣匯率的跌落，反有增加，國貨之推銷南洋一帶，已有顯著之進步，不獨南洋如此，而目還擴展至印度；如棉紗棉布汗衫手帕襪子之類，銷數都很可觀，吾國橡皮套鞋，甚至推銷英法，這是出口史上破天荒的記錄，這都是很有利的現象。</p>
<p>在此過程中，還有一種特點，也是值得吾們注意的；就是以前吾國國際貿易，一向操諸外人之手；其原因是爲了國人不熟悉外國情形，所以不僅是進口如此，出口亦然，但是現在則已慢慢的在轉移到國人手裏，經營進出口的華行日有增加，這時要使國際貿易的權屬於自己，實在是很好的機會，因爲吾們如要買德國的顏料，內中的情形，決不能比歷史很久的德商更爲詳細，現在德國貨旣不能來，乃不得不向美國去買；吾們誠然是外行，但是外商也同吾們一般外行；吾們便可以和他們競爭，這是進口方面因國際環境變化得到的好轉；出口方面情形自然相同，所以在道時候於國際貿易機構上有很多的利益，王海波先生不但是理論家，而是實行家；希望王先生領導提倡，使所有進出口事業能統操諸國人之手。</p>
<p>盧志學　這問題應分二點講，上海和內地，不能一槪而論……如果我們把自已用的東西，極度减低，一定可使入超變爲出超。但上海的入超問題很難解決。因爲一切用的東西，大半靠着外來。聲如歡廠固本肥皂的原料牛油，從前是向靑島蚌埠等地採購，從未用過外貨，現在因該地淪陷，非向澳洲去買不可；便非外匯不可。從前牛油每噸十三四元，最近達九十餘儿。又如松香須向美國去買。木箱板從前來自溫州杭州，價極便宜；現在來貨旣少，價錢亦貴。內地物價雖貴，但原料隨地都有；所以要增加生產，調整貿易，都比上海容易。姚先生說：「自給自足」的政策是不可能的，兄弟有些異議，因爲在現在，不自給自足，則困難更多，勉强做，當然不經濟，但是爲了國家，非要不可的東西，要買的買，可以做的做，不論其價錢高下，或製造成本如何……</p>
<p>我國現階段之貿易環境</p>
<p>主席　現在我國及歐陸均在戰爭期中，將來地中海，印度洋，太平洋，亦都有隨時捲入璇　的可能。在戰爭期中的國際貿易，自然有許多特殊情形。目前進出口商人感覺得最嚴重的兩大問題，即外滙與運輸。外滙上落不定，風險便隨之發生。交通阻隔，艙位短少，更有礙於貨運。在此內外戰爭的情態下，我國國際貿易究竟能吾維持，並且如何維持，情大家發表高見。</p>
<p>俞仲葵　照現在情形，實在沒有辦法；所以很　難討論。</p>
<p>張一凡　歐戰恰起，一般人很恐慌，以爲歐美將從遠東巿塲撤退；進出口貨物將無船可將；此外都在日人手裏；後以戰事不緊張，各國對華貿易照常才放心。最近又因英法給隻有繞這好望角之說，恐慌重起。其實歐戰擴大後，是不是眞的沒有給到中國來？這一點要看他們是否能自給自足？事實上他們必需到中國來買原料，所以不會沒有給來。這　然不是眞正解決，但貿易和運輸，可以維持則明甚。</p>
<p>李祖範　因爲外國需要中國的原抖，所以即使歐戰冉擴大，船還是要來，但是容量的减少是必然的，所以將影響到價錢便宜而容積大的東西來源換言之價高而容積小東西容或尚有繼續維持運輸之可能，但是價低容積大的就有問題了，譬如說「煤」從前不過十數元以至數十元一噸，目歐洲戰事發生後，立刻漲價，但是出產的地方如印度，還是祇賣得九個盧比，而運費需要五六倍，過去各工廠對於「煤」原是極小的小問題，而現在則認爲絕對的嚴重。歐美需要我們的原料，所以船一定會來，但是中國除礦產及植物油供給外，其餘的東西，還是中國需要人家的多，美國的船所以不願意增加來遠東，也是爲了裝貨來多去少，不能使之平衡，這是將來很嚴重的問題，化學工　如製造肥皂等等之主要原料碱，不論純碱燒碱同來巿卜內門洋行供給，自最近歐洲戰事突變，地中　發生危險後，便不肯出賣，因爲將來來源缺乏，毫無疑義，而英船須繞道好望角這樣一來，時間增長水脚漲價，所以類似問題，一定很多原料供給今成大問題，除了運輸問題還有外匯不穩定，使國際貿易的成本，根本算不定，因爲一批定貨到至少二三個月，在此期內實無法佔計其變動之程度，　如　廠，用的麺粉，從前一個時期是由加拿大來的，後來因外匯貴了，就改用中國貨—質地稍差—有一次外滙鬆，而國貨不够需要，所以再向外國去買，但是到的時候，市價已顯有不同，雖然敝廠早結外匯，尚無問題，但外滙之不穩定，實爲國際貿易的最大障礙之一。</p>
<p>武堉幹　關於運輸問題，除「船」之外，我覺得還有更困難更嚴重問題，上海戰前是中國國際貿易的中心，國軍西撤後，即以廣州灣，海防，溫州等口岸爲國際道路，而以香港爲貿易中心。後因英日關係一度緊張，香港有封鎖之說，後因局勢漸鬆，才無變化，但將來尚難逆料，所以不是「船」來不來的問題。我們知道西南，西北另有兩條國際通路，不過貨運的實際情形，無法確知，希望內地來的各位把知道的情形報告一些。</p>
<p>張一凡　假定運輸成問題，工商界誠然困難，政府總比私人有辦法，所以不如把雄出口事業交給國家經營，當比私人單獨辦理方便。</p>
<p>促進貿易與金融</p>
<p>主席　金融界與進出口貿易，脈脈相關；在平時爲然，在或時更爲然，金融界應如何援助貿易商，才能使公私交受其益？請大家討論</p>
<p>甘斗南　金融界與實業界必須聯合一致，現在彼此間不甚聯絡。金融界不放款於廠商，而另營其他事業，原因有二：（二）信用易於調查；（二）投機事業獲利較豐。長此以往，旣非金融實業界之禍，更非促進貿易之道。兄弟主張銀錢業應該一致援助區區僅存之民族工業，假定某廠接得三萬元定單一紙，而無銀行帮助，便因資金不足而不能接受，勢必坐失機會。金融界或恐有人利用定單，同時向幾家銀行，借款而另作別用，防範之法，由金融界聯合組織一對外貿易登記處；其任務爲實業界或出口商向金融界借款時，必須先向該處登記，由該處發給登記證，憑此向金融界借款；該處所有負責，則爲同一定單或滙票，祗能發給登記證一次；而金融界可隨時咨詢該登記處，則上述弊病，或可消弭無形</p>
<p>聶光地　接到了出口定單，就應買進原料，否則，市面波動不無危險，這樣便要一筆本錢。資金上能力有所不及，就非向銀行借錢不可；銀行不肯借，就辦不了；辦不了即少丁一批外匯。……英國各屬地，他們不許你　隨便便的把東西裝去，原因也無非是為了維持他們自己的外匯，所以我們接到定單之後，應先問明是否尤進口？可以進口的，便可想法和他們在上海倫敦等地的往來銀行合作，靠他們的力量去採購原料。不過頂好和中國商業銀行合作。假定能這樣做，對外貿易，比現在必可大得多。最近有二位朋友同我講外商銀行倒可對信用好的先借錢給你，可是不能人人做到，我們希望中國的商業銀行自己來做，尤其是對於出口商的幫助，可以使我國多得些外匯。</p>

<p>西人越牆而出後，徑奔大路之旁，見悉佈木壁，路旁皆有兵營管守徘徊，間為兵所見，俱甚忿恨！有強欲拉某他往者；有言御　已過，無庸窺探者；某立定腳跟，總不答應，惟言隱身壁後，何害之有。繼而二傭人亦氣急敗壞而來，執某手而言曰：「我等速離此處，是為上着。」某慰之曰：「汝等不如亦在此一觀，保無妨也。」傭言萬萬不欲觀，眼中之樂有限，頸際之痛無窮。時見壁上有一小孔，某即注目其中，置人言於不聽。遙聞車聲轔轔，但見很需要輜重之車，連屬而過，亂而不整。瞥見騎馬者數人，穿紅色長褂，戴黃頂帽，飛馳而過。鑾儀衛各執事人繼至。某此時極力注視，又見粗笨車紛至，穿紅褂之兵，亦紛紛跨馬而過。滿洲弓兵繼至，弓甚大而箭滿於壼，所穿之衣，或藍或白，或黃或黑不一，步亦不甚齊。及見黃　遙來，知聖駕將臨矣。皇上乘轎，以八人恭抬，皇太后宮妃俱乘黃　車，太后端坐輿中，聖容康健，皇上所御，則為靑袍也。</p>

<h3 id="c98">黑飯與白飯 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— 孟昭</p>
<p>爲在六三紀念節</p>
<p>黑籍中人，寗可白飯不吃，而黑飯（雅片）却不可一日無，夜來一燈熒燃，嘯傲烟　！左拍洪厓　，（嬌妻，　妾，）右托翡翠槍，呼呼然，吞雲吐霧，樂在其中，無論土價貴到怎樣程度，從三四元一兩，而飛升到五六十元一兩，癮君子不皺眉頭！走出來，三分像人，七分像鬼，眞令人可怖！</p>
<p>從國軍西撤以來，孤島四週的毒氛，更充滿了里弄，發國難財的，固然深溝高壘，於窗明几爭的蘭閨中，一榻橫陳，俾畫作夜，俾夜作畫，將寳貴的光陰和金錢，都付之於呼……聲裏，還有許多吃不起黑飯的癟三們，躱在每一個墻下壁角，吸紅丸，呑白面，……這些……都是亡人國，　人種的毒辣手腕的反映</p>
<p>那淪陷區城市，烟館，烟行，更是星羅棋布，引誘良善的同胞們，走入漆黑沉淪的苦海裏去，那烟館內部的陳設精緻，還有塗脂抹粉的女妖精，供你調情作樂，你誤入陷阱之後，那裏會迷塗知返呢？即如孤島歹土的所謂「樂國」也者，除了呼盧喝雉之外，黑飯與女人，是葬送你身家，性命的唯一毒物，然而身入其間者，能有幾人回頭呢？新聞報道上，平添着不少自殺入獄的新聞，豈不可慨！</p>
<p>另一面，掙扎在生活綫上的窮人，不要說吃黑飯，連白飯都有　飱不　的恐慌了！無論洋米，杜米，市斗而沽，仍有五六塊錢的代價，纔會給你一飽肚子，試問以勞力汗血換得區區酬報的勞動苦力！那裏負擔得起呢？妻啼，子號，無異人間地獄。</p>
<p>今天是林公則徐，禁烟的「六三紀念節」，筆者希望有錢吸黑飯的優閑階級，痛加戒絕，那麼放下屠刀，重新做一個完人，將戒除的錢，移救平羅經費，救濟窮人，使自己脫離苦海後，冉超度眞員沒有「白飯吃」的窮人，那眞是何樂而不爲呢？</p>
<h3 id="c99">改良男子夏服的我見 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— 君久</p>
<p>改良男子夏服，在這個百物昂貴，時間經濟兩俱需要撙節的富兒，我們覺得靑年會的提出徵求式樣，道一種倡導，是誰也在迫切期待着的。</p>
<p>過去，改良男子夏服，也曾幾度嘗試過，但它的結果，誠如耳東君所謂「計劃不善，不久便默默無聞，」這計劃的不善，我想決非負责者不肯率先倡導，忽視了羣衆的實際情形，至少也有一部分原因。</p>
<p>夏天的衣服，是以輕便凉快爲主要目的，西裝的複雜，長袍的累墜，誰也不能否認會適合於夏天穿着的，記得當時也曾有人提倡過利用工裝，學生裝，竄裝的原有式樣來加以改造，但終於也引不起大衆的同情而失敗了。這理由簡單得很，還是因爲工裝，童裝，學生裝依然緊裏着身體，而穿起來也正如西裝一般地麻煩，而且大部分人穿慣寬身大袖的華服，一且改裝，舉手投足，在在都感到不自然，因此，我覺得改良男子夏服，至少該爲大部分羣衆着想，最有效而令人樂於接受的方法，我建議還是在於利用華式衣服來加以改造</p>
<p>利用華式衣服來加以改造，不僅可以迎合大衆的心理，即在這個綢布價値昂貴得令人不敢領敎的時候，還適合於經濟條件。現在做一件新衣，用起碼的紡綢，至少也得化十多塊錢，假使改良的式樣可以用原有舊衣服來從事剪裁，我想很可以克服上述種種的困難。</p>
<p>此外，我們覺得短褲赤足，在夏天也是十分需要而値得倡導的，改良夏服，同時似乎也該顧慮到這一點。</p>
<h3 id="c100">住宅與花木 <a href="#c100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— 黎</p>
<p>凡是西方人的住宅，最注重裝飾與佈置，差不多每一間房裏，都有幾盆或幾瓶花草點綴着，自然覺得生氣盎然，怡情悅目。惟有我們中國人的住宅，不注意這個，窮苦的人家不用說了，就是有錢人家，也大半如此；除了家中有了什麽喜慶，或宴客的日子，胡亂弄些花來揷揷瓶子外，平日間簡直瞧不見花的影子，因此一些兒生氣都沒有。筆者最近去訪問一位文友，見他書室中明窗凈几，潔無纖塵，而最最難得的，是書案茶几，甚至窗檻上，都陳列着玲瓏幽雅的盆景，使我羨慕得了不得。問他是不是自己做的？他說自己沒有做盆景的技巧，這是託一位專家孔志淸先生做的。我覺得孔志淸三字耳熟能詳，似乎曾在報紙上見過，但是他所做的盆景，却是第一次觀賞，眞有巧奪天工之妙。當下我便下了個決心，定要把我自己那間雜亂無章的書室，也好好地整理一番，而第一要着，就得請孔先生給我做幾個盆景。於是又向那位文友問明孔先生的地址，據說是在薩坡　路一號，這幾天正在舉行盆景展覽會」這倒是一件巧事，非去參觀一下不可。</p>
<h3 id="c101">解決携帶午飯問題 <a href="#c101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— 孫</p>
<p>自從生活指數增高，米賣到五十元一擔，煤球賣到八八元餘一百市斤對於薪給階級之人，深感痛苦。尤其對於新式行商小供午膳之小職員，更覺困難，上小飯店吃三碗白飯要化三角錢，豆腐湯一碗須化一角幾分，每餐至少要化到四角以上，方能果腹。然而小飯店中洗碗水，令人見之欲作三日嘔，其他如煤氣，油氣以及汗穢氣等，更使人難受。故余決心自己携帶午飯，對於帶飯之器具，頗費考慮，起先想用飯盒子，或如湖絲阿姐之手提飯鍋，覺得如用上述器具，難以爲情，尤其是我們穿長杉階級的，處在當今勢利世界，早晚携帶飯鍋，恐被旁人恥笑，而冷飯冷菜對於用腦力辦事之入，食之究小相宜。最後想到用二磅廣口熱水瓶二隻，一隻盛熱飯，另一隻置熱湯菜，爲便於携帶起見，照二隻熱水瓶大小，做一手提木箱，如學童之手提書包式，携帶旣便，熱水瓶亦不易碰碎。飯可在晨起身盥洗時，放在煤球爐上煮至八分程度時，即可盛置於熱水瓶內，湯菜亦煮熱後盛入瓶中，煮飯菜所費時間不到十分鐘，至午飯時即有熱湯熱飯可吃，在夏天隔夜煮好盛入，亦可保暖至决日午飯，每餐所費大的在二角五分左右，此法行之將近一年，同事中照予法仿行者甚多。目下熱水瓶價雖貴，每只的四元幾角，若照上述辦法，所費的十元即可辦到，三個月後即可省出。現在天氣漸熱，上小飯店旣小經濟，又不衛生，倘有感覺生活不易的同道，不妨照余所述試行之。</p>
<h3 id="c102">義相墨索里尼的日常生活 <a href="#c102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— 嚴懋德</p>
<p>在歐戰局勢緊張聲中，首先値得注意的，是義大利的態度，而義大利的命運却操縱於墨索里尼一人，蓋墨氏爲一世梟雄，在歐洲和平時代，尙不顧一切，掀出東菲戰役，際茲目前英法在軍事受到極大挫折，焉有不渾水摸魚之理，因此墨索里尼的一舉一動都足以使世界人士屬目，現在道裏我記載一些關於他的日常生活。</p>
<p>墨索里尼是義國的首相，雖然獲得九六〇〇〇里爾的年俸，但他的生活，却質樸儉的，不亞於平民，而且他所著的自傳，在美國賣得五千鎊稿費，悉數捐給羅馬的貧民階級。</p>
<p>墨索里尼今年已經五十七歲了，他雖然已是久經奮鬥的半老的人，但因他起居飲食辦公娛樂有秩序，有規律，所以他至今還兼備着靑年人的氣色和精神，他具有十足樂天派的態度。</p>
<p>墨索里尼每天早晨，六時前起身，跑馬一小時，便赴盥洗室整容後，乃進早餐；咖啡，水果爲他最愛吃的東西，餐後，便開始披閱私人信札及報章，到了九時，赴國務院辦公處——他的辦公室，只是個空無陳設的大房間，他就在那半新舊的書桌上，接見所兼的六部决長及黨軍參謀長共七人，聽取各方報吿後，然後指示那種可以變更數百萬人的命運的決定。</p>
<p>十二時，他才回家進午餐，肴饌很簡單，所吃的不過些湯或肉汁，麵包，咖啡，再吃些水果，午餐用畢後，就和他幾位外甥女兒及自己最幼的女孩子玩要，玩要的時候，拔河也好，跳繩也好，堆沙袋也好，搭橋也好，甚至他在高興的時候，還得拉拉梵啞林　，此後他接見一般私人的親戚以及社會上各方面的人物，作爲他施政的對象。</p>
<p>到了四時赴國務院辦公處，接見各國外交使領人員，及重要外賓，或有時向民衆演說，至九時左右，回家吃晚餐，所吃的比較午餐豐富些，餐後便退居書室，從事讀書，默思，或著作等，高興時便在家中開映幾决不公開的電影，或舞劍半小時，但他不飲酒，也不吸烟，當他疲乏時才能入陲。</p>
<p>總之，墨索里尼每天很辛勞地，辦九小時的公，緊急時更要多些，平均每天只睡六小時，而在日常生活方面的享受，是極端質樸而平民化的，可是他的體格，仍可比作呆重的蠻牛，於决日再開始他艱重的工作。</p>

<p>這幾天的鰣魚，貴得了不得，竟要兩角錢一兩了，即使心中愛吃，也實在吃它不起，不得已而求其决，還是吃吃鮝魚吧。况且這幾天的鮝魚，也實在廉得出人意外，每兩只要二三分，不吃更待何時？鮝魚的味兒很鮮，可說不在鰣魚之下，無論紅燒淸燉，都很可口！尤其是淸燉，只須放幾塊猪油丁和少許甜醬葱薑在內，吃起來幾與鰣魚不相上下，所差的沒有鰣魚鱗片部分那麼腴美罷了。然而二角一兩與二三分一兩，相差幾有十倍，爲經濟起見，還是舍彼就此吧。</p>

<p>我們都知道星子，並且愛星子。兒童舉目仰望天上星光點點，覺得有點希奇，科學家以望速鏡向天空凝視，比兒童更覺希奇，因爲他比兒童多知道星子是怎樣的奇怪。主耶穌自比爲星說，「我是明充的晨星。」他的意思何在？星子與我們有何關係。第一，星子是導師。古時指南針尙未發明，水手在海洋中朽船，惟一導師，卽是星子。歲是如今的大海船，若無星子在天空指示，他們的船，也不能行的那麽快，那麽穩妥。人生好比大海，世上的　婦都是這人生大海的船。有的一開行就遇險，有的晴天開出，一路順風，後來却不幸碰在石頭上，或擱淺在沙灘上。還有的受風浪打擊，被急流冲得走錯了方向，但末後却安安全全到了目的地。這樣說來，我們要這人生之船，在大海中安穩行駛，決少不得要有一顆明星來引導我們的行程。我們要自己的身體，記憶，思想，幻想都得着正確的指導，不走人歧途，那末惟一妥當的引導明星，就是耶斛的言語和榜樣。第二，星子的運行。黑夜時候，我們仰望天上的星子，半夜時候又再望，便可以看出星子的地位前後大有變動。在西邊的不見了，在頭上的走到了西方，在東方的走到了頭上。這好像星子是在運行，實在呢，不是星子運行，乃是我們在地上的人，因着地球的旋轉，實實在在運行。上　對於我們也是如此，有時上帝好像離我們很近，那時我們的信心堅定，愛心溫暖，我們便認出上帝是在我們左右，有時呢，好像上帝走開了，不再與我們親近了，其實，這不是上帝離開我們，乃是我們遠離上帝，因爲上帝是昨在，今在，以後永在的。（待續）</p>

<h3 id="c106">博良薪的薪給支票 <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Crarroll　D．Alcott　立人譯自大陸報</p>
<p>工部局已宣布爲挽留局方律師博良、Robert　T．Bryan，Jr．）服務計，必須付給年俸美金七千五百元。博良有他的特殊才能，即熟知中國民法和刑法，所以見工部局的要員，可是博良的重要，是否是有在此艱難時際，付給美金七千五百元年俸的價値一點，必有許多人將起疑問，當你想到工部局工務處小工三千人，因要求每日增加工資二角左右（後來尤加一角八分，合每人年增美金的三元四角），局方竟讓其罷工，你便要狐疑工部局對薪給問題，是否還措施確當？</p>
<p>當然，局方會說你出幾塊錢，便可找到不少小工，而要員却難覔得這是實情，不過祇在某種程度內是如此，在我本人說來，我從不欺騙自己而信他人，若得機會，來辦理我的職務，不能跟我辦得一樣妥善，工資低微的三千小工，能爲求稍飽其腹而使本市的康健，陷於危境，那時候，公衆便開始失却其對工部局要員的信仰了。工部局各部份首腦人物如屬必要，應獲巨俸，即使是用外幣付給，我也以爲然，可是應付若干薪給的問題，須加鄭重考量。在三年前，工部局律師年俸美金七千五百元，似乎嫌其過巨但在今日，却的確太高了。</p>
<h3 id="c107">上海之典當業 <a href="#c107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— 王沛</p>
<p>典當本爲地方當局所設，不以營利爲目標，純粹輔助平民經濟爲宗旨，本爲一有利於貧民之借貸處所。惟恐其借後不還，故以物典質之，遂有典當之名。其所定利息特低，月息祇一二分。其後一般商人見有利可圖，乃紛紛設立以營利，將利率日漸抬高，盡失其輔助平民經濟之本意。</p>
<p>我國典當業所取利息之高，爲世界各國所罕見，就上海而言，普通一般典當爲月息一分八厘，亦有一分六厘，唯較少耳。除利息外，另有種種剝削方法，如期限方面：有月不過五之法，即每月過期五天，利息照一月計算；此外尙有所謂手續費，存箱費，包裝費等名目。名曰按月一分八厘，實已二分數厘矣。故現時之典當，已成爲一變相之高利貸款處</p>
<p>滬上一般典當業所定之滿當期限，類皆爲十八個月。自本月一日起，典當業已議決將滿當期限改爲十二個月，即自物件送入典當起，取贖時間不得超過十二個月，吾則即行沒收。滿期後雖有寬限若干日之規定，唯在此期間，須納較高之利息。縮短當期之主要原因，當然爲各典當當物過多，貧民無力取續，使典當資本不能周轉，但斷然縮短當期，則對於貧民將更加重一層剝削了。因貧民未能在此短時期內籌得現款，唯有眼見期滿而被沒收。故縮短當期，在當店果可增加一筆巨大收入，對於平民即縮短其贖取所當物之機會，間接亦即縮短貧民之半計。</p>

<p>限止種植，勒令禁烟，在戰前已相當獲得成績了。各縣各鎭都普遍有禁烟局之設，限令吸食者前往登記，依年齡之大小而分戒絕之先後。吾鄕已從未滿二十歲起而至四十歲以十齡爲一期，則已達第三期矣。戒絕這種惡嗜好的人數，可以說得在十份之七八以上。而貧寒者可以在指定的醫院中，獲得經濟的優待。但是抗戰旣興以後，一部份人在租界中私下活動，在淪陷的更憑藉了特殊勢力，公開高張　談話處，而不知自愛的同胞，又墮入了地獄。</p>
<p>所幸租界的禁例與中國政府的命令相同，如果能有切實或大規模的「禁毒運動」，不難將毒氣肅淸的。希望就從今天始，像努力推行「日光節的」運動及「安全」運動那樣，一鼓而使那些妖魔無從遁逃，則租界上的犯罪案或許也能因之减少</p>
<p>而每一個中華民國的人民，應該堅强起來，已脫離苦海的，別再被引誘，吾則也應立志自强，即日戒除。在建立中的新中國是不需要墮落的人民。</p>

<p>— 程小靑著</p>
<p>第一章　「一位挺漂亮的小姐！」</p>
<p>那女客約有五呎一二吋高度，在我國東南一帶普遍低矮的女性中，已可算得長身玉立」。上身披着件淡靑色細嗶嘰的短帔，下面露出紅白相間條了綢的頎袍，一直蓋到伊的銀皮鏤孔的鞋背上面。伊有一個瓜干形的臉兒，頰骨部分紅得刺目，一雙靈活烏黑的眼睛，罩着兩條細長的人工眉—原來伊的大然眉毛，時時遭受理髮匠的摧毀，已不留絲毫影踪！那鼻子的部位生得很恰當，鼻樑也細直而並不低陷，也是搆成伊的美的重要原素。那張小嘴本來是伊的美的主因之一，可是因着塗了過量的口紅，使我見了覺得有些兒「凛然」。伊臉上的皮膚固然是白嫩細膩到了圾高度，可是我小敢相信，大半定是借重了「鉛粉」的力。因此伊的芳齡究竟是十八九，還是二十三四，也不容易判斷。</p>
<p>「你—你不是霍桑—」伊　壁疑訝似地瞧着我，一壁舉起伊的指爪上塗着粉紅色蔲丹的尖細的手指，掠　伊的燙捲的近乎赭紅的頭髮。伊的手指上還戴一隻相當大的鑽戒。</p>
<p>我答道：「霍先生馬上就回來。要不要坐一坐？我說這句話委實有些勉强，因爲伊的那種不自然的矜貴之態—傲氣，和那種無禮貌的稱呼，已漏出了伊的身分或敎育程度。</p>
<p>伊將那帔肩卸了下來，露出兩條也經過人工裝點的玉臂一。伊的衣服很單薄，因着成衣匠的精緻的技巧，那頎袍和伊的肌肉特別熨貼，越顯得不足以抗禦這暮春的曉寒。但伊似乎並不覺得，使我不能不佩服都會女性的抗寒力的高强。</p>
<p>伊坐在靠書桌的那張沙法上，把一條腿疊了起來，我的眼睛便又增加一種色彩。伊的脚也和我一樣是赤裸的，那銀皮的鏤孔中露出了猩紅的趾爪。伊坐時的那種姿勢似乎非常熟練，翹起了一隻脚，把一隻紅白相間的皮手夾擱在大腿上，眼睛向我瞟了一瞟，彷彿等我去奉承的樣子。（三）</p>

<p>Paris - The General Headquarters announced in a war bulletin this morning that German forces launched continuous attacks in the Dunkirk area in the north yesterday. Our troops fought bravely and fiercely. Furthermore, Allied forces continued to evacuate from Dunkirk port day and night yesterday under enemy aircraft bombing and artillery fire. As for the enemy forces on the Somme River line, they launched multiple small-scale offensives yesterday, all of which failed. In other areas, there was only artillery fire. (2nd Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris - Responsible military figures stated that the enemy forces are unlikely to launch a large-scale offensive in the next few days. Furthermore, according to news received here, the fortress of Calais in the north is being defended by a British detachment and has been for a week. As of last night, it was still in British hands. (2nd Havas News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris - French military officials announced that British and French troops who lost contact with the main force retreating toward Dunkirk have now rejoined the Allied forces. The number of these troops is unknown. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris - Military figures here stated that according to news from Dunkirk, although Allied forces are subjected to German aircraft bombing and artillery fire, they are still continuously withdrawing from the Flanders area. As for the vicinity of Dunkirk, it is almost completely flooded. In addition, the Allied forces are bravely resisting in the suburbs, making it difficult for the German forces to advance swiftly, allowing them only to bomb and shell with aircraft and artillery. Furthermore, several Belgian troops who refused to surrender have broken through the German lines and arrived in the Dunkirk area to join the Allied forces. A portion of the Allied forces are responsible for covering the retreat of the main force, and they continue to fight and retreat toward Dunkirk today. As for the German forces in the Abbeville area at the mouth of the Somme River, they launched multiple fierce attacks with the assistance of aircraft and tanks, but were repelled by the French forces. German forces also launched a surprise attack on the upper reaches of the Somme River, which also failed. (1st Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris - General Headquarters announced a war bulletin tonight, stating, "Our troops resisted enemy attacks in the north of the country and effectively covered the continuous retreat of Allied forces. Apart from some activity along the Somme River, there is nothing else to report. Also, a squadron of our bombers flew to the north yesterday afternoon to bomb enemy concentration points, and then flew to the Meuse River, Moselle River, and Rhine River areas for reconnaissance. They also engaged in combat with enemy aircraft in the Rhone River valley, shooting down several enemy aircraft. The exact number is still being determined." (1st Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>London - As the last part of the British Expeditionary Force in Dunkirk fought fiercely today to cover the retreat of the remaining British and French troops in Flanders, resisting the German advance, the British side has also formed a combat force to cope with the war on another front. A large number of soldiers retreating from the north, after a 48-hour break, will be assigned to the newly formed expeditionary force to go to the battlefield under the command of Allied Commander-in-Chief General Weygand. It is generally believed that this new army may join part of the existing French forces jointly defending the Somme line. (2nd United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>German War Bulletin</p>
<p>German Führer Headquarters - Yesterday, German forces continued to advance towards Dunkirk along the coast on both sides. British troops resisted stubbornly, and the fighting was exceptionally fierce. Nieuport is in the hands of German forces. Attin-Couck State, west of Furnes, and Ghyvelde, ten kilometers east of Dunkirk, have been occupied by German forces. German forces captured a large amount of war materiel. One army captured 200 cannons of various types. There was no special development in the southern theater. German bombers carried out low-altitude attacks on troop transport ships in Dunkirk, sinking four warships and eleven transport ships (approximately 54,000 tons). Fourteen warships, including two cruisers, two light cruisers, one anti-aircraft cruiser, six destroyers, three torpedo boats, and thirty-eight merchant ships (approximately 160,000 tons), were also hit and severely damaged. Many other small boats capsized. The dense troops on the beaches of Dunkirk were also bombed by German aircraft. German torpedo boats also destroyed several sections of the British Marseille-Lyon railway. The Allied forces lost a total of 58 aircraft yesterday, of which 42 were shot down in air combat, 8 were shot down by anti-aircraft guns, and the rest were destroyed at the airfield. A total of 15 German aircraft are missing. On the Norwegian front, German forces advanced from Trondheim and have occupied Bodø, capturing a large amount of military supplies. (2nd Reuter dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin - The German High Command announced last night that the remaining British Expeditionary Force troops attempted to escape to warships off Dunkirk in various vessels yesterday, but were bombed by the German Air Force, which sank 40,000 tons of transport ships and troop ships, as well as four other warships and fifteen merchant ships. In air combat, 40 enemy aircraft were shot down. (2nd Havas News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin - According to military journalist Lenz, after German motorcycle units occupied a fortress near Bollezeele, they discovered several British destroyers approaching the coast. A soldier in the unit, a trained artilleryman, fired five shots and sank one destroyer. (2nd Havas News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin - Military officials in Wilhelmstrasse announced last night that the first phase of Hitler's spring offensive has now been completed. Three elite army corps in northern France have been annihilated, and the remnants of the British Expeditionary Force have been routed. The British army lacks tanks and mechanized equipment, but a part is still trapped in Dunkirk and the large sand dunes extending to Nappol. The resistance of the northern French army no longer exists fundamentally. German authorities acknowledge that the British army, aided by heavy fog, has transported a considerable number of troops across the Channel, but they say that the British losses are extremely heavy. According to the German side, the British army has occupied positions near Dunkirk due to the flooding of the Bassée Canal, but German troops have already occupied a bridgehead of the canal and will soon be able to eliminate the last British resistance. (2nd United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Heavy Fog Along the Channel - British Expeditionary Force Continues to Retreat</p>
<p>Paris - The French Air Ministry announced that despite heavy fog along the Channel coast, our aircraft were still carrying out missions over the Dunkirk area last night to supply land forces and brought back information about enemy artillery positions, especially to the north of the Bapaume-Amiens line and northeast of Abbeville. Yesterday, French bombers bombed enemy motorized units between Doullens and Abbeville. The airfield occupied by German forces was also bombed. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin - According to the German News Agency, a German military expert said that the British Expeditionary Force has had unexpected luck, because visibility has been poor in recent days, so they were able to retreat in large numbers. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris - The main force of the British Expeditionary Force retreated yesterday to a semi-circular area of 35 miles around Dunkirk, under the protection of British and French naval artillery and the support of the Royal Air Force. The remaining troops are currently resisting German forces, so that General Beauvoir's troops can break through the narrowest gap to reach the coast. The artillery positions of the Dunkirk fortress have been greatly increased, and the remaining French fortresses along the 35-mile coast have been temporarily shelling German forces. At the same time, Allied naval artillery is also firing. In the evening, bombers and large transport planes take turns dropping food and other items in the fortress positions. Because of the adverse weather conditions, many German aircraft have stopped taking off, so the Allies were able to act calmly. The German side is doing its best to curb the retreat of the troops, with paratrooper units dropping sea mines and torpedo boats traveling along the coast to sink warships. German heavy artillery is shelling Dunkirk and the port's shipping stations outside the Allied semi-circular position. A military spokesman said, "If the German offensive is blocked for a few more days, the British Expeditionary Force will suffer few losses. The Navy's rescue of heroes fleeing from Flanders is a great battle record in its glorious naval history." (2nd United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>German and Italian Newspapers Speculate on the War Situation - Battle for Paris to be Launched</p>
<p>Berlin - German political figures anticipate that the First World War in France will soon end. What is currently being paid attention to is where the second step of the German troops will advance. A Hamburg foreign newspaper stated that Führer Hitler's strategy is to pursue the victory and not allow the enemy to have a chance to breathe, especially in today's favorable situation, and will undoubtedly continue the offensive. The newspaper pointed out that the German army is now only 100 kilometers from Paris, and the French front line is more than 300 kilometers long, with no shortage of weak points that can be attacked. Therefore, the defensive plan of French Commander-in-Chief General Weygand is difficult to implement effectively. (2nd Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>London - The Air Ministry announced that several of our aircraft had engaged in many fierce battles with enemy aircraft in the Flanders area yesterday while covering the retreat of troops. They also bombed enemy bridges, tank and motorized units, and infantry units. A "Messerschmitt" fighter plane attacked one of our bombers from only 40 yards away, but was eventually repelled by our plane and seen burning. In addition, a group of our bombers engaged two enemy "Junkers" aircraft in the port of Ostend, Belgium, and threw them into the sea before escaping at full speed. The rear machine gun of one of them had been destroyed by our plane. Also, an enemy reconnaissance balloon was shot down by our plane near Nieuport, Belgium. (2nd Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris - The Air Ministry announced that a group of our bombers flew to Dunkirk port last night and dropped military supplies and ammunition by parachute to supply the defending forces. A group of our reconnaissance planes also flew to various parts of the front line this morning for reconnaissance. We obtained important information on the activities of German artillery units on the Bapaume-Amiens line and northeast of Abbeville. Today, a group of our bombers again flew to the north bank of the Somme River to bomb enemy military targets, and dropped no less than 22 tons of giant bombs between Amiens and Doullens. In addition, several enemy aircraft were shot down by our planes in the Rhone River valley. (1st Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris - As the Battle of Flanders draws to a close, there has been a noticeable increase in the activities of the German Air Force in other parts of France. The Lyon area and various places in southwestern France have been subjected to intense bombing. Details are not yet known. Air raid alerts were issued in Saint-Étienne, Roanne, Toulon, and Marseille. As a result of the bombing in Gannat, some people were killed and injured, and some buildings were burned down. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris - It has been learned that German aircraft flew to various cities in southern France today and bombed Lyon, Toulon, and Saint-Étienne, among other cities. Air raid alerts were issued in all of these cities. 40 people were killed or injured in the Lyon area. (1st Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome - A military column analyzing the situation on the Western Front was published in the Roman newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia, claiming that the next major battle will be the battle for Paris. The German high command hopes that the battle in Flanders will end within 24 hours. (2nd United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Copenhagen - According to the Danish newspaper Politiken, France's current problems are different from those of the past few weeks, and now the German army will adopt an offensive, first encircling the large French forces within the Maginot Line and breaking the resistance of the French army. At that time, Britain will be isolated and unable to maintain contact with the European continent. (2nd Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>British Troops Tenaciously Defend Calais Fortress - Food Supplied by Aircraft</p>
<p>Paris - A spokesman for the French military stated that the Allied forces, mostly British troops, defending Calais are displaying unparalleled heroism in the siege warfare. These few defending troops are supplied with food by parachute and supported by the air force in combat, resisting German troops that outnumber them many times. Although the fort's artillery positions have not been modernized, its walls are still strong and there are deep underground chambers that can avoid aerial bombardment. The spokesman also said that the troops in the Dunkirk area are still boarding ships as quickly as possible despite all kinds of difficulties. German troops have distributed long-range heavy artillery around Dunkirk in the past 24 hours to shell incessantly, and are carrying out intense bombing with the air force. Allied aircraft are launching intensive attacks, not only causing heavy damage to German bombers, but also to German troops on the ground. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e5">The Expansion of the European War and Shanghai's Future <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>The British and French Allied forces have just retreated from the Flanders area after a bitter battle, and the issue of Italy's participation in the war has reached a critical point. The international situation is clearly continuing to unfold in adversity. In the future, wars and chaos will follow one another, and their impact and outcome cannot be predicted at present. As a result, the hearts of the people in the isolated island have also become turbulent in recent days; the future and safety of Shanghai have clearly become the most concerning issue for people.</p>
<p>In fact, this is not a new issue. In the past three years, Shanghai people have had at least two similar experiences: the Sudetenland dispute and the outbreak of the war in Western Europe both caused the atmosphere in Shanghai to become tense at one time. However, those two crises were quickly resolved, so people, apart from experiencing some emotional fluctuations, did not seem to deeply understand their meaning and lessons. What followed was the prevalence of speculation and hoarding, and the pursuit of personal gain reached an unprecedented peak. The sacred cause that the nation and the nation were experiencing was gradually diluted in people's minds due to the long period of time and the remote space. Recently, because of the expansion of the European War, people have once again felt concerned about the future of Shanghai. In fact, this is just an expansion and continuation of an old problem after the Chinese army withdrew from Songhu.</p>
<p>Comparing the previous two incidents with the current one, the Japanese attitude in the autumn of 1938 was the most arrogant. When Chamberlain flew to Berchtesgaden twice, the situation in Shanghai also became unprecedentedly serious along with the European continent. At that time, the Japanese warlords seemed to be waiting for the news of the breakdown of the European situation to immediately test their sharp edge in Shanghai. When the European War broke out last autumn, although the Japanese side also asked Britain and France to withdraw their troops stationed in China, their posture was relatively mild, and after Britain and France did not consider it, they got along peacefully and there were no major changes. Until recently, Japanese public opinion was extremely mixed, but its military and political authorities were unusually cautious, and have not yet made any explicit expressions. This change in attitude naturally cannot be immediately concluded as representing the Japanese action, but it can be seen that the Japanese warlords have gradually changed from tense to cautious. And what determines this change in the Japanese warlords is none other than the setbacks and lessons that the Japanese side has suffered in the invasion of China. If the European War had broken out between 1935 and 1936, not to mention Shanghai, a small area, I am afraid that all the powers' possessions in the Far East would have been regarded as loot by the heroes of Miyakezaka. Also, if China's resistance to Japan had unfortunately failed or compromised, then Shanghai's neutral situation would never have been maintained for three years. Therefore, the future of Shanghai cannot be separated from the entire anti-Japanese war of resistance. Speaking from a local situation alone: Shanghai may not experience any accidents in the near future. Because the powers are determined to maintain the status quo in Shanghai; a few days ago, US Fleet Commander Hart also took precautionary measures on the Shanghai situation. The Japanese warlords, even though they are already drooling over the Dutch East Indies, whose country has been completely occupied, dare not act rashly. Therefore, even if Italy is involved in the whirlpool of the European War, Shanghai's safety may not be immediately disturbed in any way. However, looking further ahead: since the international situation is continuing to deteriorate, no corner of the world may be able to escape the entire disaster alone. Which of Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, and Belgium is not an independent country that has no desire to contend with the world, but all of them cannot escape the nightmare of being invaded and enslaved. If the European War continues to expand, it is not known how many innocent people and countries will be involved. At the same time, a nation that is seeking liberation through resistance is actually paying attention to the safety of its own lives and property, which cannot be regarded as a kind of illusion. If we take a step back and say that Shanghai alone can stay away from all disasters for a long time and form a disguised utopia, then how can an isolated island and its residents that cannot produce on their own continue to maintain their survival in the turmoil of the world? It must be known that the welfare of the four or five million people in Shanghai is not only tied to the fate of the isolated island, and the changes in the international situation, but mainly depends on the future of China's anti-Japanese construction cause. If we temporarily put aside the current smoky environment and turn to look at the great rear of free China, then everything is too optimistic! Three years of hard fighting have tempered and rejuvenated the long-buried national spirit and vitality, and have shown vigorous phenomena in all aspects. For example, the cruel bombing of Japanese planes may cause people to imagine tremors; but in fact, whether in cities or towns, it only aroused the spirit of raising donations and revival, and unlike what the Japanese military spokesman hoped, it will not cause the Chinese people's spirit of resistance to be destroyed. Moreover, often after the bombing, while clearing away the rubble, new foundations are laid to engage in reconstruction. It is said that some cities have been completely renovated because they have been bombed. This fully demonstrates the Chinese people's indomitable perseverance, and also symbolizes the future of national rejuvenation. Looking at the military aspect again: recently, the British, French, and Belgian Allied forces fought against German tanks, and the military equipment of both sides was comparable, but the battle situation turned into a one-sided situation; while the inferiority of China's military equipment is almost disproportionate to the Japanese army, but it can stand up to the Japanese army for three years, and repeatedly defeat the Japanese army's mechanized units and blitzkrieg strategy. This is such an exciting thing and strengthens confidence. Therefore, if we only think about the immediate interests of ourselves, we may feel that there are dead ends everywhere; but if we focus on the long-term prospects of the nation, then there is nothing but light. Knowing this, people really do not need to worry about the safety of the isolated island, only by contributing human and material resources to the motherland to promote the early arrival of victory in the anti-Japanese war of resistance is the supreme way to ensure personal interests.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Washington Official Circles Predict Germany and Italy Will Adopt a "Peace" Offensive; Fascist Party Congress Resolves to Support Joining the War; Anglo-French Relations with Italy Worsen <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>New York, United Press Dispatch from its Washington diplomatic correspondent: U.S. official circles predict that Germany and Italy will launch a "peace offensive" and issue an ultimatum to support it. Should this "offensive" fail, Italy will then enter the war. Washington officials have not yet received definitive information on this matter, but according to the most reliable sources, Italy will propose a general outline of peace proposals to the Allied nations in the name of itself and Germany. The details will be decided at a future peace conference. Italy's demands on Britain and France will also be included. As seen by Washington observers, Italy's recent military preparations and various belligerent gestures are "tactics" for the peace offensive. In their view, Mussolini is not merely making empty threats. Once the ultimatum is issued, there will be no possibility of retreat. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>London, Well-informed sources here recently commented that certain neutral countries, especially the United States, have subtly advised Italy that maintaining neutrality is advantageous and that joining the war would be detrimental in various ways. However, this advice has not been effective. It is said that these countries may make similar efforts again, but it is unlikely to achieve anything. In Italy's view, this is merely a "blackmail" tactic, hoping that Britain and France will make significant concessions. However, the result of such concessions would only delay Italy's entry into the war. Aware of this, Britain and France, in addition to taking preventive measures on land, sea, and air, will also exert significant economic pressure on Italy. The effectiveness of this policy will soon be seen. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Rome, The National Executive Committee of the Fascist Party recently convened here, chaired by Secretary-General Muti. It immediately passed a resolution stating that our country lost 600,000 officers and soldiers in the last European war, a very significant sacrifice. Subsequently, it suffered "unjust sanctions" during the Abyssinian campaign. Today, this Committee feels that the current blockade is suffocating our country and unanimously supports our leader (referring to Prime Minister Mussolini) in striving for our country's maritime independence. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Rome, According to foreign observers, Italy's entry into the war is imminent, likely to coincide with Germany's attack on French forces, with offensives launched in multiple locations. North African French Tunisia and British Malta in the Mediterranean are the main targets. At that time, the Italian navy and air force, assisted by the Swedish air force, will launch a fierce attack on British and French fleets in the Mediterranean. However, Italy's entry into the war will not affect the attitude of the Balkan countries. Turkey and Yugoslavia will only join Britain and France after being attacked by Italy. Italy, not wanting to fight on two fronts simultaneously, will naturally avoid attacking Turkey and Yugoslavia. Furthermore, Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu's resignation, replaced by the pro-German Gigurtu, indicates a shift in the country's policy towards the German-Italian axis, which is noteworthy. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Rome, According to inquiries from reliable neutral diplomatic sources, Italy's participation in the European war is a matter of days. Diplomats and well-informed Italian political figures emphasize that Italy is fully prepared militarily and determined to break the Anglo-French grip on the Mediterranean. (Haitong, 2nd)</p>
<p>Rome, Prime Minister Mussolini met with the commander of the Italian air force, Felain, yesterday and gave instructions. (Haitong, 2nd)</p>
<p>Rome, Relations between the Allied countries and Italy continue to deteriorate. Consequently, foreigners are hurriedly leaving Italy. Trains heading towards the border are full of foreigners. However, French and British nationals who went to the Ministry of Interior to obtain exit permits were told to return in five days, at which time, if approved, the permits would be issued. Passersby generally expect Italy to enter the war between June 4th and June 14th. The Italian cabinet is scheduled to meet on June 4th. Crown Prince Umberto, commander-in-chief of the northern region, took a special train to Turin yesterday. German Ambassador Mackensen saw him off at the station. The Crown Prince was wearing civilian clothes. General Graziani, former governor of Abyssinia, also accompanied him. The Crown Prince will inspect the annual gathering of the national reserve infantry in Genoa. He will also participate in the annual infantry gathering in Fiume on June 8th, 9th, and 13th.

<p>London, Yesterday, the British naval and military officers' publication "Navy" published an article discussing Italy's entry into the war and warned Italy that if it joins the war, it will be very disadvantageous to Mussolini. Admiral Fremantle, a renowned naval officer who has experienced many wars, discussed Anglo-Italian naval warfare in detail in the publication and said he believed that Italian intervention would not harm the Allied forces but would harm Italy. Furthermore, Brigadier Montgomery-Massingberd, former Director of the British General Staff, said that Mussolini has incited Italy's ignorant youth, causing a war fever, believing that Italy can gain glory in this war, not knowing that when bombs and machine guns fall on these young people, their uncontrollable war fever will immediately dissipate. However, Montgomery-Massingberd and Fremantle share the same view that the Allies should not underestimate Italy's resources and combat capabilities. (Associated Press, 2nd)</p>

<p>Madrid, Spanish students held a demonstration yesterday, chanting "Gibraltar" and singing the Falange party anthem. The British and French embassies were heavily guarded by police and armored vehicles. The demonstrators were dispersed by the police at one point, but they continued to march in groups, chanting "Gibraltar." (Haitong, 2nd)</p>
<p>Madrid, The new British Ambassador to Spain, Hoare, arrived here yesterday. Subsequently, several thousand Spanish citizens gathered in front of the embassy, chanting "Who does the Strait of Gibraltar belong to?" Then they shouted, "It belongs to Spain!" The police arrived and dispersed the crowd. (Haitong, 2nd)</p>
<p>Madrid, The Spanish Falange party newspaper "Arriba" stated that Spain's demand for the return of Gibraltar is not because the port is a historical fortress, but because it is Spain's sacred and inviolable land. The isolated fortress of Gibraltar has lost its military value to Britain. The newspaper pointed out that Gibraltar was the key to the Mediterranean in the age of sailing ships. Since the invention of submarines and airplanes, Gibraltar can no longer control the entrance to the Mediterranean. Spain's air bases in Andalusia can dispatch aircraft within minutes to control all key points in the Strait of Gibraltar. The British fleet can no longer obtain safe protection in the port of Gibraltar. (Haitong, 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e10">British Expeditionary Force Evacuation Situation; British Soldiers Recount Experiences <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>A port in southeastern coastal Britain, Allied warships from Dunkirk shelled German forces last night that were attempting to prevent the Allied evacuation from the Flanders region. British Expeditionary Force soldiers who recently evacuated here claimed that the Allies used various ships in Dunkirk to evacuate "the besieged Allied forces in northern France." One British soldier claimed, "The Allied situation deteriorated. They waited on the sand dunes, several miles long outside the leveled city of Dunkirk, for ships to evacuate. They dug holes in the sand to hide. While the soldiers were digging holes, they were repeatedly attacked by German artillery, planes, bombs, and aerial machine guns." British and French soldiers who recently arrived here told reporters that German forces were approaching Dunkirk and were shelling Dunkirk with mortars. Around Dunkirk, the Allies used all vehicles and destroyed lumber to create a final defense line to resist the German forces. In addition, the Allies only relied on rifles and the cannons of naval warships to fight. The Allied forces in Dunkirk were mostly rear-guard units. They had nothing but rifles and relied on the navy's cannons as their only savior. In the past few days, I have spoken with British and French soldiers who have experienced air raids and spent their days on the beaches. The conditions they encountered are unparalleled in British history. Yesterday, German planes bombed British transport ships, and the artillery fire on both sides was intense. Both sides suffered heavy losses. The sound of heavy artillery can be heard here. According to soldiers who recently arrived here, the final defense lines built by the British and French forces in the Flanders region and Dunkirk were guarded by soldiers carrying rifles. In the early stages of the retreat, the Allied forces were protected by heavy artillery, but when they retreated to the coast, the Allied forces used rifles to resist German four-inch mortars, heavy artillery, and automatic weapons. During the final series of attacks, the German army did not use tanks. It is generally speculated that the German army stopped attacking with mechanized units and replaced them with artillery and infantry. A Scottish soldier told reporters, "This battle is fluid. Soldiers cannot dig trenches. What they encounter is fierce artillery fire from the enemy. The enemy first uses heavy artillery, then four-inch mortars, and then attacks with very low-flying planes. After these three attacks, the enemy soldiers have already rushed to within fifteen yards of the British lines. This happened repeatedly. When the German artillery stopped firing, our soldiers, lying on the ground, looked up and saw a large number of German soldiers carrying light machine guns and rifles. They had already arrived. We repelled them, but they came again. In an environment where we were outnumbered ten to one, we could only retreat step by step. Our retreat was orderly, and we repeatedly inflicted heavy damage on the enemy, but because of the enemy's superior equipment, we could only fight step by step. If we had the same equipment as the enemy, we could end the war in three months. When we fight the enemy one-on-one, the enemy cannot resist. Even with inferior weapons, we can often repel the enemy. We only use bayonets and rifles." (Associated Press, 2nd)</p>

<p>Chongqing: A spokesman for the Military Commission discussed the war situation from this past week (May 26th to June 1st), stating that the fiercest fighting occurred on the borders of Henan and Hubei provinces and in southern Shanxi. The Chinese army continued to achieve brilliant victories. On other battlefields, fierce battles raged between Chinese and Japanese forces, with the Chinese army consistently inflicting defeats on the Japanese. A detailed account of the operations follows:</p>
<p>Henan-Hubei: Remnants of the Japanese army in northern Hubei, after their defeat last week, find themselves in an increasingly desperate situation. The Chinese army is simultaneously clearing out remaining Japanese troops near places such as Yangjiadang, Chengjiahe, and Taipingzhen, while also pursuing and encircling Japanese forces in the area north of the Dabie Mountains. Significant victories have been repeatedly achieved this past week. The remnants of the Japanese army attempted to break through the Xianghua Road and Zaozhong Road to retreat, but were defeated, leaving behind several thousand corpses. Currently, the Chinese are tightening the encirclement while simultaneously adopting new tactics to pressure the Japanese army. On top of their defeats, they are on the verge of complete annihilation. Furthermore, in the Xinyang area, the Chinese army captured Lianghekou and repeatedly stormed strongholds such as Wangjiadian and Dongshuanghe, capturing and killing many enemies. The southern section of the Pinghan Railway has been cut off by the Chinese army.</p>
<p>Guangdong-Guangxi: The Chinese army in southern Guangdong continued its victories from last week, launching fierce attacks on the Japanese. They successively recovered places such as Dahua'ao, Heshui'ao, Jinjinao, Shiliuwei, Tanghenkeng, Fengdou'ao, Fenghuoling, and Wugongshan. On the 26th, they captured Liangkou in one fell swoop, killing countless Japanese soldiers. The Japanese regimental commander Yamamoto Niro was also killed on the spot. To salvage their overall losses, the Japanese have been continuously reinforcing their troops south of Liangkou. Currently, they are engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese forces near Mibu. The Japanese army in southern Guangxi has repeatedly invaded Tunlun and Dazhi, but has been repeatedly defeated by the Chinese, leaving behind many corpses.</p>
<p>Hunan-Jiangxi: The Chinese army in northern Hunan has repeatedly launched mobile offensives, achieving significant gains. Strongholds such as Dashaping and Zhaoliqiao have been repeatedly stormed by the Chinese army, resulting in the deaths of many Japanese soldiers. Japanese warships in Yueyang have made several attempts to harass, but have all failed. In northern Jiangxi, Japanese forces advanced from Pingze and Duchang towards the Chinese defense line. After being defeated by the Chinese, they retreated in disarray. The Chinese army pursued them along several routes, capturing Tugang and Mamaqiao, and directly pressing towards Huangtuling inside the city of Pengze. Another route led to the capture of Mabiqiao and Caijialing. On the morning of the 27th, Japanese reinforcements attacked Liuhua, but were again defeated by the Chinese. The remnants of the Japanese army retreated in disarray towards Hukou, with the Chinese still in close pursuit.</p>
<p>Southern Shanxi: The Chinese army, through astute and meticulous deployment, recaptured the strongholds of Xianweng Mountain and Zisha Village southeast of Qinshui on the 27th, killing a large number of Japanese soldiers. While the Chinese and Japanese forces were engaged in fierce battle, Japanese reinforcements arrived from Qinshui and Duanshi, but were again defeated by the Chinese as they advanced east from Xianweng Mountain. In this battle, over sixty Japanese soldiers were killed, over twenty Japanese vehicles were destroyed, and over a thousand boxes of artillery shells and over ten bags of rice were seized. Japanese forces near Yangcheng launched a joint land and air offensive starting on the 26th. One unit invaded Longzhang and Wenjialing on the 27th, but after being fiercely attacked by the Chinese overnight, Wenjialing was recaptured by dawn on the 28th. Remnants of the Japanese forces in Longzhang are still being surrounded and annihilated. Another unit attacked the areas of North and South Xiangtai and Upper and Lower Baisang, but after being fiercely attacked by the Chinese, the Japanese suffered over half their casualties. Currently, the Chinese are simultaneously blocking the enemy while sending strong forces to encircle the enemy's rear. It will not be difficult to annihilate these Japanese forces completely. Furthermore, Maeda Osamu, the Japanese division commander who was wounded, has died of his injuries in Beiping. In addition, in northern Henan, on the 22nd and 23rd, the Chinese army destroyed three Japanese bridges and killed over ten Japanese officers, including Okada, in the Youmiao area.</p>
<p>Northern Jiangsu: Japanese forces in Gaoyou and other places launched offensives towards places such as Yuhekou, but were repeatedly fiercely attacked by the Chinese, resulting in many Japanese deaths. The Japanese also released large amounts of poison gas. Yuhekou once fell into Japanese hands on the 26th but was recaptured by a fierce Chinese counterattack on the 29th. The remnants of the Japanese army retreated in disarray, with a total of over 1,500 Japanese soldiers killed. Hasegawa, the Japanese garrison commander in Shaobo, was also killed by the Chinese near Renqiao on the 29th. Furthermore, on the 28th, the Chinese air force destroyed over a thousand Japanese vehicles near Anlu, killing many Japanese soldiers.

<p>Chongqing: Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke recently gave a speech on the eve of the centenary of the Opium War, stating that China must resolutely resist all imperialist evils. The Chinese people have already resolved to liberate themselves and not be conquered by foreign powers. President Sun appealed to all those addicted to opium to make a firm resolution to save themselves and said that whether China can completely eradicate opium depends on victory in this war of resistance. "Who can forget the horrors of opium? In 1840, Mr. Lin Zexu engaged in burning opium to resist the imperialist powers who invaded us a hundred years ago. In the past three years, our resistance has fully demonstrated our desire to liberate ourselves from our semi-colonial status. We have decided to fight against all imperialist evils in order to completely eliminate them." The National Anti-Smoking Conference will be held in Chongqing tomorrow to discuss Chairman Chiang's six-year anti-smoking plan, and this year is the last phase of the six-year plan to eliminate opium addiction in Free China.

<h3 id="e25">China Will Surely Unite to the End to Strive for Final Victory; Has Established a Strong and Powerful Army Sufficient to Fight for Freedom and Independence <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: A report from Moscow states that the latest issue of the World Economy and Politics magazine, edited by the renowned Soviet scholar Varga, contains a special article discussing the Chinese political situation, stating that China has established a strong and powerful army during the war of resistance, which is sufficient to fight for China's freedom and independence. The Chinese people and army have united to fight to the death against Japanese imperialism. As a result of this war, Japan's political and military strength are showing signs of collapse. Conversely, the Chinese army's combat capabilities and political awareness have greatly increased, and its previous military and technical shortcomings are gradually being eliminated. At the same time, the mechanized units, military experts, and superior tactics that Japan previously relied upon for its advantage are no longer evident. This proves that China has progressed in this war, while Japan has regressed. Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang and the National Government, China has unified its army, which is extremely important. This is why China is becoming stronger and Japan is becoming weaker. Last year, someone from the Japanese side declared that the China problem cannot be solved by bayonets and must be shifted from large-scale military operations to political activities, seeking to collude with China's reactionary elements. Japan's weaknesses are becoming increasingly apparent, and its desire to rely on puppets is becoming more urgent, while the position of the Chinese National Government is becoming stronger as a result. Japan is currently using Wang Jingwei and the puppet Kuomintang, but Wang has no social standing and has even less status after becoming a Japanese puppet. In addition, the Japanese side is engaging in absurd propaganda in an attempt to undermine China's internal unity. In reality, China will surely unite to the end, jointly resist the invaders and reactionary elements, and achieve final victory. (2nd Dispatch)</p>

In addition to various comfort items and souvenirs, a portion of which has already been purchased by the association, it also intends to solicit commemorative items from all walks of life for forwarding, with commemorative items of brocade banners, silver shields, and other items of commemorative significance being the standard.

<p>Paris: General Honzig, Commander of the Colonial Army, recently published a message to his soldiers, stating, "The war has already begun. What the enemy wants to attack is our army's morale. Their strategy is to win by intimidation. In reality, large-scale aerial bombing, although fierce, has limited effectiveness, as proven by the facts. The method of dealing with it is very simple. When enemy aircraft attack, hide; once finished, return to your posts. Moreover, our army also has aircraft for cover, so what is there to fear? As for tanks, they cannot do much either. Each soldier can temporarily hide and let them pass, then attack the guide. Tank teams without guides are like blind men. Each tank must have gasoline supply to operate. In short, do not be misled by rumors and obey the orders of your superiors." (2nd Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>Washington: President Roosevelt recently requested the government to grant him full power to call up the National Guard to cope with the possibility of "dangerous developments" in the Western Hemisphere. US Army Chief of Staff Marshall yesterday issued a statement expressing his support for the President's request, saying, "The US Army currently has only five streamlined infantry divisions (each with 8,500 men) serving in the US mainland. The sixth division is being organized. After a dispute occurs in the Western Hemisphere, the United States must have more trained troops." General Marshall did not specify where the dispute will occur in the Western Hemisphere, but due to the European war, questions have been raised here about the status of Britain, France, Denmark, and the Netherlands in the Western Hemisphere. In addition, there are widespread rumors in the United States that pro-German political activities are already underway in Latin America. (2nd United Press Dispatch)</p>

<p>London: Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi visited the British Foreign Office yesterday afternoon, expressing the Chinese government's extreme concern about the reopened British-Japanese commercial treaty negotiations. A United Press reporter inquired about this matter with the British Foreign Office. A spokesperson for the British Foreign Office denied the claim that Britain would guarantee the supply of gasoline to Japan, saying that the gasoline issue was not mentioned in the British-Japanese negotiations. However, it was indicated in the British-Japanese talks that rubber and tin produced in the Dutch East Indies and Malaya would be exported to Japan. It is generally believed that the items Britain will export to Japan include timber produced in the British Empire. As for Japan, it is promised to stop transporting raw materials for war from Dalian and Vladivostok to Germany. Regarding Ambassador Guo's expression to British Undersecretary Butler yesterday, both the Chinese and British officials remain silent. However, the League of Nations had a resolution stipulating that all member states should not engage in any actions that hinder China's war of resistance.

Therefore, it still only considers reality. In short, the Soviet Union's position is on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, which is a historical tradition, and will not go elsewhere."

<p>Oslo: German Commissioner for Norway, Terboven, recently gave a speech at the Oslo Palace stating that Germany does not intend to undermine Norwegian neutrality either before the current war or during the war. My subordinates should also not interfere in Norway's internal affairs. Terboven then solemnly stated that Germany's only task in Norway is to implement a peaceful economic construction plan, so that all Norwegians can benefit from it. He hopes that Norwegian administrative officials and business leaders will consider this plan and cooperate with it. In terms of Norway's economic development, Germany is now opening up a raw material market for it in Central and Southeastern Europe, but the raw materials on which Norway's own survival depends will be protected. At the same time, Germany will supply Norway with the raw materials necessary for the implementation of the economic construction plan. Terboven also expressed his willingness to do his best to solve the unemployment problem in Norway, and mentioned that Germany has decided to release Norwegian prisoners of war.

<h3 id="e44">Record of a Mission of Shame to Germany (3) Translated from the original by Sir Nevile Henderson <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>I was summoned back to England at the end of January 1938, to receive instructions in order to negotiate with Hitler. Judging from the German press and what Hitler occasionally revealed to the British, there were two main obstacles between England and Germany. One was the anti-German policy adopted by England in Europe, and the other was the refusal to return the colonies "seized" from the Germans. I was instructed to inform Hitler that the British government was, in principle, prepared to discuss all outstanding issues.</p>
<p>I returned to my post on February 4th. Seeing that the atmosphere was unfavorable, I postponed my visit to Hitler until March 3rd. By this time, Lord Halifax had succeeded Eden as Foreign Secretary. On this day, I visited the Old Reich Chancellery and was invited to sit on a large sofa against the wall facing the window. Dr. Schmidt, the translator of the German Foreign Ministry, sat to my left. Further to the left, forming a semicircle, Hitler sat in an armchair with rounded arms, facing me, and next to him was Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. After stating the purpose of my visit, I said that my intention was not to haggle. The British government was well aware of the many thorns ahead, but was also convinced that if both sides could act on the basis of reciprocity and replace force with higher principles, all difficulties could be resolved. The status quo could be changed, but on the basis of higher reasons. What needed to be reviewed urgently between the two countries was the reduction of armaments, the restriction of bombing (the British government also hoped to abolish bombers), and the peaceful settlement of the Czech, Austrian, and colonial issues. What I wanted to know was what contribution Germany was prepared to make to maintaining peace in Europe.</p>
<p>This was perhaps the longest statement I had ever made to Hitler, lasting about ten minutes. He listened quietly, huddled in his chair, his face grim, occasionally revealing displeasure. However, my tone was firm and moderate, making Hitler's expression unnecessary. After I finished speaking, Hitler immediately said that he could do nothing until the British newspapers stopped attacking him. (He repeated this point in every conversation.) He also could not tolerate interference by third countries in Central European affairs. Millions of Germans were being treated unfairly. Germans should enjoy the same rights to self-determination and autonomy as other nations. Only 15 percent of Austrians supported the Schuschnigg government. If Britain opposed a reasonable solution, the Germans would only resort to force. If German nationals in the area were oppressed, he would intervene with lightning speed. Austria must hold a plebiscite to determine its fate, and the Germanic residents of Czechoslovakia should obtain autonomy in cultural and other affairs.</p>
<p>He was not interested in the colonial issue. For half an hour, he kept complaining about the attacks in the British newspapers, the interference of British bishops in German church affairs, and British interference in various matters (according to Hitler, these matters had nothing to do with Britain to begin with), as well as the abuse of National Socialists and Germans in the Czech and Austrian territories. He then returned to the issue of disarmament, claiming that the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact and the strength of Czechoslovakia were both threats to Germany. Therefore, German armaments had to be greatly expanded, and any discussion of disarmament should be transferred to the Soviet Union. The most difficult thing was that "some people actually trust treaties signed with the uncivilized Soviet Union. It should be known that any treaty signed by the Soviet Union is worthless, and that country must not be allowed to set foot in Europe." Even regarding the prohibition of using poison gas, who could believe that Soviet Russia would never break its word?</p>
<p>I met with Hitler for about two hours, during which Ribbentrop offered some opinions to Hitler regarding the attitude of the British newspapers. I immediately asked him how a person who had lived in Canada for many years and had been an envoy to Britain could be so ignorant of British psychology and customs. At that time, Hitler did not yet listen to Ribbentrop as he would later, and could still understand my rebuttal.</p>
<p>On the evening of March 11th, Göring held a grand banquet and dance at the Aviation Association, with thousands of guests. I was also invited to attend. Everyone was discussing the Austrian issue. At this time, someone handed me a telegram, urging me to talk to Neurath. The whole room fell silent, and two thousand pairs of eyes were focused on me. Shortly after, Göring arrived and shook hands with us, looking very lonely. After sitting down, he tore off half of the program and wrote a short note in pencil, which he had the American ambassador's wife deliver to me. It read, "I would like to have a talk at the end of the party and explain everything." The last five words were underlined three times. I waited for an opportunity to follow Göring out of the hall. For the next three-quarters of an hour, everyone speculated about what had happened.</p>
<p>The conversation between the two of us in Göring's private room was not pleasant. Göring accused Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg of being untrustworthy, and that there was no other way but the current method. Shortly after, I learned that the German army and air force had crossed the border and Austria had been annexed.</p>
<p>I defended Schuschnigg until I was hoarse. Finally, I said to Göring, "Even if the Austrian Chancellor is unwise, the Germans cannot use this as an excuse to send troops." Then I took the opportunity to urge Göring not to harm the Austrian National Socialists. Upon returning to the hall, I made another suggestion to Göring that if he did not want Hitler to know the British public's reaction to this, it would be best to prevent Hitler from seeing the British newspapers for two weeks.</p>
<p>At this point, there is one more thing that must be recorded. March 13th was the German Day of Remembrance for soldiers who died in Europe. Representatives from various countries participated in the memorial service as usual, but I declined to participate due to the German-Austrian incident, the blood of which had not yet dried. Moreover, to express an underlying meaning, I visited the Austrian ambassador instead. I went by car, with the British flag displayed on the front of the car. When I arrived, I saw the Austrian ambassador in full military uniform, preparing to attend the memorial service. Afterwards, I heard people say that the Austrian ambassador had given the National Socialist salute at the meeting and had shouted "Heil Hitler" with the crowd.</p>
<p>From then on, the Czech issue became tense, and Prime Minister Chamberlain first flew to Berchtesgaden, then to Godesberg, and finally to Munich. I do not want to make hasty judgments about the Prime Minister's tireless efforts, leaving them to be criticized by historians in the future. At that time, some people, overestimating their abilities and unwilling to reject the moral ground of the right to self-determination in the Sudetenland, felt that our response to Hitler's bluff in September 1938 was a mistake, which I think is completely wrong. It should be known that simply saying "no" to a dictator does not help. At the time, I said, "To deal with Hitler's intimidation, we must be prepared to bear all the consequences." Did France have this preparation at the time, let alone Britain?</p>
<p>After Prime Minister Chamberlain decided to meet with Hitler, he departed from London at 8:30 a.m. on September 15, 1938, and flew to Munich four hours later. That morning, I took the train to meet him. The Prime Minister, at the advanced age of sixty-nine, traveled by car and boat for ten hours, and then met with Ribbentrop and Hitler for a long time, and telegraphed the details to London. He was busy all day and did not go to bed until eleven o'clock at night. He claimed to have strong bones, and his belief was not false.</p>
<p>He arrived at Berchtesgaden at about 4 p.m. that afternoon and rested briefly at the inn. Then he drove to Hitler's mountain villa. Hitler came down the steps to welcome him. During tea, they chatted for about twenty minutes. Hitler then invited Chamberlain to talk in his study.</p>
<p>I did not want Ribbentrop to be involved. The meeting records were kept by Ribbentrop, which was against the usual practice and were not shown to Chamberlain, causing the Prime Minister much inconvenience, especially during later talks. Fortunately, in subsequent talks, Welles was present, and I also sometimes participated.</p>
<p>The first conversation lasted for three hours. Hitler stated that peace negotiations should be based on the recognition of the right to self-determination of the Germans in the Sudetenland. Chamberlain acknowledged this principle, but it had to be approved by the cabinet and agreed to by the French and Czech governments. At this point, Hitler made an appointment for another talk.</p>
<p>The next morning, Chamberlain flew back to London. He immediately summoned Sir Runciman (the British unofficial mediator to Czechoslovakia) back from Czech to England to discuss. The French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister arrived in London on September 18th. In order to maintain peace and uphold the important interests of Czechoslovakia, the British and French governments jointly advised Czechoslovakia not only to recognize the right to self-determination in the Sudetenland, but also to cede land with more than 50 percent of Germans to Germany without a plebiscite.</p>

<p>These few words fully illustrate that health is the key to the strength or weakness of a country. When we are now fighting with all our strength, we should especially cherish our health, conserve our energy, and fight, work hard, and sacrifice for the country and the nation, and continue to show our potential strength and constantly fight with the demons that surround us. We must understand that violent storms are raging in the isolated island, and unreasonable oppression and cruel destruction are coming one after another. We must resist and struggle, we must complete the mission of resistance and construction, and our responsibilities are so important.</p>
<p>Root Out Drugs, Eliminate Drugs Completely</p>
<p>If we do not have a strong physique, everything will be lost. Not to mention that it is impossible to develop our great Chinese culture into a golden age, even preserving our Chinese history of more than 4,000 years is questionable. Therefore, on this day of June 3rd, especially in this year when the six-year anti-smoking plan expires, we should especially keep in mind the following two sentences: "Root out drugs" and "Eliminate drugs completely."</p>
<p>Do Not Smoke Opium, Do Not Sell Drugs</p>
<p>To put it more clearly, drug resistance must be done from the root, and drug resistance must be completely eliminated. We cannot allow ourselves to have the slightest negligence, and we cannot allow ourselves to have the slightest slackness. We will not only not smoke opium from now on, but also not sell any drugs from now on. We will not only not sell any drugs ourselves, but also give a head-on blow to any conspiracy to undermine our anti-smoking plan, and smash it without leaving any traces. Only in this way can the drug resistance problem be thoroughly solved. All citizens of our city, based on this spirit, should be the vanguard of smashing conspiracies, support the central government, obey the President, do it earnestly, and create a vigorous and prosperous China.</p>
<p>Notice to Young People Issued by the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League issued a notice to the youth of the city, saying, "Dear youth of the city, on June 3, 1839, that is, today 101 years ago, Lin Wen-zhong, Governor-General of Huguang, burned 20,000 boxes of imported opium in Humen, which showed his determination to ban smoking. (Omission)"</p>
<p>Drug Policy is Chilling</p>
<p>In the past ten years or so, on the one hand, the national government has strictly implemented the anti-smoking plan, and on the other hand, Japanese imperialists have been actively promoting the drug policy to find the country. Since the September 18th Incident, the Northeast has been increasingly poisoned under the rule of the Japanese. According to the number of opium smokers in Manchukuo announced by Japan itself in 1938, it was 13 million, accounting for one-third of the total population of Manchukuo. Since the Lugouqiao Incident, Japan has gradually occupied the coastal areas of North China, Central China, and South China, making Tianjin, Shanghai, and Xiamen the base for the poisoning of North China, Central China, and South China.</p>
<p>Determined to Ban Drugs, Smash Conspiracies</p>
<p>In August 1937, after the Japanese army captured Beiping, many prisoners were executed, but this group of opium offenders completely regained their freedom. In 1938, the puppet regime in North China openly abolished the National Government's anti-smoking regulations, and all opium offenders in North China were released. All these facts show how Japanese imperialists want to fully use the drug policy to enslave our nation.</p>
<p>The People Themselves Take Responsibility</p>
<p>President Chiang has repeatedly instructed us that this six-year ban will destroy our country, but the National Government will never neglect the ban because of the Japanese imperialists' military invasion, because the drug policy is a kind of aggressive policy of the Japanese imperialists. We must resist military aggression with military force, and at the same time, we must smash the drug-induced conspiracy with the determination to ban opium.</p>
<p>The People Themselves Take Responsibility</p>
<p>President Chiang has repeatedly instructed us that this six-year anti-smoking plan must be implemented. This year is the final deadline for banning opium, so this year, we must drive the drug atmosphere out of the country. However, in the occupied areas of the Japanese imperialists, the power of the government cannot reach, and this anti-smoking responsibility needs to be borne by our people themselves. President Chiang once instructed us on the Anti-Smoking Day last year, "I hope that all compatriots in the country must assist the government in implementing policies with 120,000 points of sincerity, and everyone should regard anti-smoking as their own responsibility." Especially young people, especially young people in the Shanghai area, need to take this responsibility seriously, because we firmly believe that young people can best embrace this determination to ban drugs, and only by starting with young people can this anti-drug effort be most thorough.</p>
<p>Shanghai Youth Rise Up Together</p>
<p>Youth of Shanghai, we must revitalize our spirit, we must strengthen our physique, and form a powerful new force in the national anti-war front. We must absolutely isolate ourselves from opium. We must continue to resist violent aggression, and we must make the country and the nation stronger day by day. We must not neglect the major policy of banning opium. Slogans: (1) This year is the central government's final deadline for banning opium. (2) Opium is a tool for weakening the spirit. (3) Opium is a sharp weapon for injuring the body. (4) Opium is a demon that destroys one's will. (5) Opium is a shackle that binds the mind.</p>
<p>Various Circles Separately Advise to Eliminate Drugs</p>
<p>The Chinese Seamen's Union Holding Staff Office, taking today as the day when Lin Zexu burned soil in Humen, Guangzhou, which has been designated by the central government as Anti-Smoking Day, the union must convene meetings of seamen from various rounds every year to hold commemorations to promote this year's anti-smoking festival in order to express support for the central government's national policy and encourage seamen from various rounds to have a deeper understanding of the anti-smoking national policy and the spirit of automatic implementation. Therefore, we will implement spiritual commemoration methods, and the union will notify various工友 to hold commemorations separately in the small group meetings of each transmission during their spare time. At the same time, it will also issue a letter to the national seamen工友 on the "June 3rd" anti-smoking festival. In addition, the Shanghai National Datong League Liguo Friendship Society and others have also issued articles, advising to eliminate drugs, and the articles are too long to be included.</p>

<p>The Association of Lower-Ranking Officers of the 162nd French Army Division held a meeting at 10:30 a.m. yesterday (the 2nd) at the Army and Navy Headquarters on Avenue Magy. The French Commander of Defense Forces in China and other military aides were invited to attend.</p>

<p>Regarding the French Concession Public Works Bureau's plan to balance the 1940 budget by implementing a slight additional tax from July 1 this year, and the agreed increase in tax rates, as mentioned in the newspaper on May 29, it is now known that the tax increase proposal was proposed by the Director of Finance, Qu Dan (translated), at the Public Works Bureau meeting on the 20th of last month, and has been approved by French Consul General in Shanghai, Eugène. The tax rate increases remain as reported previously, with land tax increasing from 9, 10, and 11 per thousand to 11 to 13 per thousand based on land rights. House tax will increase from 17 percent to 22 percent. The license taxes for other public rickshaws, chartered carriages, privately owned rented carriages, free carriages, privately owned automobiles, mechanical bicycles, public automobiles, freight cars, and delivery vehicles will each increase by 40 percent. It is reported that the French Public Works Bureau, in order to supplement the recent large expenditures, has also taken measures to increase taxes. At that time, it will be implemented simultaneously with the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Bureau's increase of municipal donation by 50 percent. It is reported that this tax increase method is currently a temporary regulation, and a separate notice will be issued when it is formally implemented.</p>
<h3 id="e53">"Special Police" To Be Organized Soon; Legal Rights Not To Be Violated; Tax Issue To Be Negotiated By Both Sides; The Bureau Is Unlikely To Overstep The Court's Authority <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the negotiations on road construction beyond the boundaries, since the Shanghai Municipal Council's Chief Inspector Bowen put forward the final proposal, the puppet side has not yet come up with an answer. This intermittent situation does not bode well for the future. However, according to news that came out yesterday, this "Special Police Bureau," which consists of six "branches," has been under detailed negotiation by both sides for more than a month. A concrete agreement between the two parties can be expected to be established by mid-June at the latest. As for other pending issues, such as (1) the closure of gambling dens in the western district of Shanghai, (2) the tax issue, and (3) the court issue, it is said that "they will also be resolved soon."</p>
<p>"Special Police Department" Likely To Be Established</p>
<p>According to someone familiar with the Shanghai Municipal Council, the council is making its best efforts to find ways to improve the current situation. Eliminating secret organizations and the existence of evil forces in the lawless area is a matter of great urgency. Therefore, the leading group has repeatedly sent personnel to negotiate with the Japanese intelligence agencies. Japanese Consul Miura believes that the most effective method is to quickly establish a "Special Police Department." Therefore, given the trend of the situation, this "police department" may be established in the middle of the month. This is evidenced by the prior closure of gambling dens, which makes it even more likely to be realized.</p>
<p>Court Issue Unlikely To Be Compromised</p>
<p>As for the tax issue, the Shanghai Municipal Council has appointed Director-General Fessenden, Deputy Director-General Keswick, and Finance Director Moller to negotiate with the puppet side's representatives. However, the puppet side's representatives have not yet been determined, so it can only be said that they are preparing for negotiations. It seems premature to say that an agreement has already been reached. However, the court issue concerns China's sovereignty. The Chinese government successively recovered the legal rights of the two concessions in 1930 and 1931, which are related to agreements with six countries: the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Norway, and Brazil. This cannot be violated by any country. The puppet "government" has not been recognized by the authorities of the two concessions, so it cannot become a negotiating partner. If one of the six countries does not agree, a small number of countries cannot negotiate separately with any party. Since the United States opposes Japan's unilateral actions in the Far East, and friendly nations and democratic countries recognize the independence and integrity of China's territorial sovereignty, we can confidently assert that none of the countries that participated in the recovery of the Provisional Court agreement would risk such a great transgression. Therefore, the Japanese side's claim that "the court issue will also be resolved soon" is merely an illusion.</p>
<p>Police Commissioner Knows Nothing About It</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the Japanese-language "Continental News" reported yesterday (the 1st) that the Shanghai Municipal Council and the "Shanghai Municipal Government" have recently reached an agreement on the establishment of a special police force in the western district. The reporter asked Police Commissioner Major Bowen of the Shanghai Municipal Council about this last night. He replied that he knew nothing about the establishment of the special police bureau having been finally agreed upon, because the negotiations between the police department and the "Municipal Police Department" are still in progress. According to the news published by the "Continental News," the Shanghai Municipal Council and the "Municipal Government" authorities have recently reached an agreement on the establishment of a special police bureau and six branch bureaus in the western district after a month of negotiations. The new police officers of the bureau will first order all gambling dens in the lawless area to close.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Relief For Ningbo's Food Shortage; Concrete Measures Planned By Shanghai Fellow-Provincials Association; Sent Letter To Ningbo For Review <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the problem of the Ningbo rice shortage has become serious. After repeated calls and appeals from various agencies and organizations in Ningbo, the Fellow-Provincials Association invited Ningbo natives in Shanghai and leaders from all walks of life to hold meetings to raise large sums of money, order foreign rice, transport it to Ningbo, and organize price stabilization sales to help the fellow villagers. Specific measures were drafted and sent to Ningbo for review a few days ago. The measures are recorded as follows: (1) A special committee will be formed, with members appointed by both Shanghai and Ningbo to cooperate; (2) The standard for ordering foreign rice is 100,000 bags, and the average selling price is assumed to be 30 yuan per market stone. It is estimated that each bag will lose 15 to 20 yuan, with a total loss of 2 million yuan; (3) Shanghai will be responsible for raising one-third of the total amount, i.e., more than 1.333 million yuan. The first batch of 50,000 bags will require raising more than 666,000 yuan. More than 520,000 yuan has already been advanced, leaving a shortage of 140,000 yuan, which can be paid at any time. The remaining half will be paid when the second batch of 50,000 bags is processed, without a fixed deadline; (4) The funds for purchasing rice should be raised by Ningbo, and the proceeds from the sale of rice will also be collected by Ningbo; (5) The funds for purchasing rice should be submitted to the ministry for free remittance. The tax exemption for the import of foreign rice and hemp bags should be handled in accordance with the original plan approved by the Sanbei Price Stabilization Association; (6) This price stabilization rice will begin with 18,000 bags of rice shipped from Hong Kong by the Grant Line, and will continue until 100,000 bags have been processed. It will also be clearly distinguished from the previous efforts of the Ningbo Food Company and the People's Food Relief Association; (7) The selling price of the hemp bags will be offset against the losses, with the proportion shared by both parties; (8) Except for Cibei and Zhenbei, which are already being handled by the Sanbei Price Stabilization Association, the price stabilization sales in Yin County, Cixiao, Fenghua, and Tiehai counties will be handled by the county magistrates, who will discuss and distribute rice equally.</p>

<p>Yu Zhijie initiated the Sanbei hometown price stabilization, pledging private property worth one million yuan as a price stabilization fund to order 200,000 bags of foreign rice. Still feeling insufficient, he telegraphed the chairman of the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China, Communications Bank, Bank of Agriculture and Commerce and the Four Banks, requesting to serve as the price stabilization fund of 450,000 yuan. The office has now been ordered and approved to reply to the Shanghai branch for borrowing.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Wenzhou Navigation Not Disrupted; Although The Port Is Blockaded, It Is Still Possible To Find A Way In <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Wenzhou navigation has been obstructed by Japanese warships, which is a common occurrence since the opening of navigation. Recently, the Japanese Navy issued a warning to the British and American consulates, stating that "if ships of third countries sailing to Wenzhou do not comply with the orders of the Japanese Navy, they will take necessary measures." After that, foreign shipping suffered a severe blow. For example, the Yi Hua foreign company's "Binli" ship was blocked and ran aground, the Portuguese merchant ship "Minhe" and the German merchant ship "Hanna" were unable to enter and returned to Shanghai, and the German merchant ship "Feikanglun" was blocked outside the Oujiang River estuary. Almost no ship was spared from obstruction. However, in order to maintain navigation, the ships continued to operate. During the past week, the situation eased slightly because the Japanese warships outside the Oujiang River estuary had been ordered to sail elsewhere. Therefore, all ships sailing to Wenzhou were able to enter the port. However, it is known that most of the ships entered the Oujiang River at night to avoid being seen by the Japanese warships. Currently, there are a total of fourteen foreign ships operating on the Shanghai-Wenzhou line. More than ten ships are currently unloading cargo in Wenzhou and will continue to return to Shanghai this week. As for the Japanese warships firing on foreign ships outside the Oujiang River estuary, it has happened more than once. Sometimes they fire blank shots to intimidate, and sometimes they use machine guns to strafe aimlessly. The foreign ships are deeply indignant at this deliberate obstruction of navigation. The Japanese side prevents foreign ships from sailing to Wenzhou, claiming that the Oujiang River has been blockaded by the Japanese Navy with mines, and there are many dangers for ships entering the port. Therefore, the so-called ships of third countries must comply with the orders of the Japanese Navy, that is, they are prohibited from entering the blockade line. However, the foreign ships believe that this method is a fundamental prohibition of navigation and should not be followed hastily. Therefore, the ships continue to operate as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e57">British, French, and Italian Liners Sail to Shanghai As Usual <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>A French liner from Marseille, which arrived in the Far East at the end of April, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 1st of this month after arriving in Hong Kong last week. Due to delays en route, the journey from Hong Kong to Shanghai was delayed by two days. According to company news, the ship will arrive in port today and berth at the Bund's Shuntai Wharf. This ship's journey from Europe to Shanghai took more than a month, which is unprecedented. In addition, the voyage of British ships sailing to the Far East has also been extended since the British government ordered them to change course and sail around the Cape of Good Hope in Africa. One of the Changxing Company's ships, the Empress of Russia, will arrive in Shanghai today. After arriving in the Far East, the ship will still sail to Kobe and other ports in Japan as usual. The date of departure from Shanghai will be more than half a month later. The Italian Mail Boat Company's Conte Verde recently sailed from Europe to Shanghai without any obstruction along the way. After completing the loading and unloading of passengers and cargo in Shanghai, it will set sail from Shanghai to Europe at 8:00 AM on the 9th, passing through Hong Kong, Little Luzon, Singapore, Colombo, Bombay, and other ports to reach Genoa.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Fire At Sijing Destroys Forty Or Fifty Stores; Estimated Loss Of 300,000 Yuan <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Since the last fire in Sijing Town in western Shanghai, most of the destroyed houses have been rebuilt with simple thatched cottages. Fire prevention is extremely worrying. Unexpectedly, on the 26th of last month, a second major fire broke out due to the carelessness of a small worker repairing the water drain in the Tianzhang Sesame Cake Shop. Tianzhang Sesame Cake Shop is located east of Dongshi Bridge and west of Zhangjing Bridge in the town. It is one of the larger shops in the town and has a thriving business. Recently, due to damage to the eaves, workers were hired to repair it. At around 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 26th, the small worker repairing the water drain, Ma Yeqing (ten years old), accidentally overturned the stove onto the thatched roof next door, causing the burning charcoal fire to ignite the firewood. In an instant, it spread and burned. At that time, the southeast wind was blowing, and the wind helped the fire, making it unstoppable. Moreover, the streets there were narrow, and the neighbors on the left and right were also on fire. At the same time, it also affected the shops on the upper and lower banks. By the time the rescue efforts were made, it was already beyond control. It is estimated that a total of 34 shops on the upper and lower ponds, totaling 45 storefronts, were burned from the Pin Fang Photo Studio at the east end of Zhongshi Bridge to the Shao Dasheng South Goods Shop at the east end. The property loss is estimated to be 300,000 yuan. Yao Aju, who lived in the Xiehe Shunchou Silk Shop, was seriously ill and died on the spot from the shock. The list of burnt shops is as follows: (Upper bank) Wang Tianzhang Sesame Cake Shop (where the fire started), Shao Dasheng South Goods Shop, Wang Zhengxing Teashop, Wang Yixing Noodle Shop, Guangda Foreign Goods Shop, Lead Sheet Shop, Sock Shop, Umbrella Shop, Fang Jiulun Silk Shop, Yida Tea Candle Shop, Tianyitang Pharmacy, Tianzhutang Main Entrance, Bicycle Shop, Xieheshun Silk Shop, Pinfang Photo Studio, Noodle Shop, Central Teahouse, Zhang Fuxing Shoe Shop, Wang Wan sells groceries (total of 19 shops). Lower bank, Salted Meat Shop, A Bao Fish Shop, Tianshouzhai Rice Shop, Zhang Yuanchang South Goods Shop, Coppersmith Shop, Basket Shop, A Jin Tofu Shop, Chen Chenhe Umbrella Shop, Hongchang South Goods Shop, Bamboo Shop, Fruit Shop, Zhang Futai Basket Shop, Du Desheng Shoe Shop, Bookstall, Meat Shop (total of 15 shops. The losses of Wang Yixing, Zhang Yuanchang, Fang Jiulun, and Xiehecheng were the greatest.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Police Chief Smith Did Not Return To England; Japan's Hope For His Departure Is Clearly Deliberate <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Police Chief Smith of the Public Concession Shanghai Municipal Council has been performing his duties effectively and is highly regarded by the council. However, the Japanese side claimed that Smith was a reserve officer in the British military register. In mid-last month, it was rumored that he had been summoned back to his country. Later, seeing that Smith had no intention of leaving and was performing his duties as usual, it was suspected that the Shanghai Municipal Council had deliberately concealed the matter and was discussing with the British government to postpone Smith's recall to the military. Yesterday, the Japanese side's "Continental News" even said that the Shanghai Municipal Council was planning to retain Smith, or to reappoint a certain American, the former deputy director-general, and choose one of the two. It also said that if Smith joined the military, his vacancy should be filled by Police Chief Robertson of the Special Police Force or Deputy Director-General Akagi, who would serve concurrently. From this, we can see the Japanese side's intentions. However, according to inquiries by the reporter of the Dazhong News Agency from well-informed sources, it is said that there is no news about Smith being summoned.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Amid Fluctuating Prices, Labor Disputes Arise Frequently <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Although prices in this city have not fallen sharply due to the decline in gold prices and the appreciation of the exchange rate, some prices have continued to rise. The working class is still mostly in hardship, and labor disputes have arisen frequently. It is hoped that the capitalists will understand the plight of the employees and voluntarily increase wages appropriately, so that these people can work with peace of mind and avoid unnecessary losses. The details of the three labor disputes are recorded below:</p>
<p>Tofu Workers' Strike</p>
<p>After the tofu shop workers in this city began their work slowdown the day before yesterday, the labor and management have not yet reached a solution. Yesterday afternoon, the tofu shop workers in the western Shanghai area also joined the work slowdown. However, the work in each tofu shop is still proceeding as usual, because the number of workers hired in each tofu shop is small. After the work slowdown, their work can be handled concurrently by apprentices and family members of the shop owner. Therefore, each tofu shop can still deliver goods to the market. The Tofu Industry Association Management Committee announced yesterday the contents of the association's resolution to increase workers' wages, which are roughly as follows: "(1) Starting from the 15th of this month, wages will be increased by five cents per day; (2) In addition to the remaining amount of eight dou, two cents in legal tender will be added per dou; for more than twenty-four dou, the increase will be doubled." However, it is heard that the workers are demanding that the capitalists pay a monthly salary increase of 7.5 yuan, so the two sides have not been able to reach a satisfactory solution.</p>
<p>Bada Silk Factory</p>
<p>The Bada Silk Weaving Factory on North Henan Road has been slowing down work for ten days because the workers demanded that the factory increase wages by 50%, but did not get it. Although the Industrial and Commercial Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council sent personnel to mediate, it did not yield results. At 10:00 AM yesterday, the factory suddenly ordered the workers waiting in the factory for a solution to leave the factory, causing a conflict. At that time, two male workers were injured. One, Li Jingjin, 28, was sent to the Kaifeng Road Refugee Hospital for treatment. The other, Lu Lai, now all the male workers in the factory have been forced to leave the factory and live in the factory's workshop at No. 177 Jielu. Some of the female workers have left the factory and returned home. The striking workers, because their livelihoods have been cut off, are calling on their colleagues for relief and have been using the donated funds to cook two meals of porridge a day to fill their stomachs.</p>
<p>Jingxin Printing Bureau</p>
<p>The labor dispute at the Jingxin Printing Bureau on Glock Road in the French Concession has lasted for a week. While the capitalists have declared that they will dismiss the striking workers, they have also recruited new workers. It was learned yesterday that the factory has been scheduled to start work this morning. In addition to the newly hired workers, there are very few old workers who are allowed to enter the factory to work, because they still insist on demanding that the factory increase wages by 20 yuan per month.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Japanese Warships Gather In Zhejiang Sea <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>According to reliable information from the shipping industry, Japanese warships have recently gathered in the Zhejiang Sea, seemingly with some kind of plan. Large Japanese warships and small Japanese cruisers have been anchored off the coast of Yantian and the estuary of the Oujiang River for many days and have not yet sailed away. Three Japanese transport ships are anchored off the coast of Dongshajiao, Daishan Island, Zhoushan Islands. A flagship and a destroyer are anchored in Dinghai Shitougang. Yamada, a senior commander of the Japanese war zone, landed there to reinforce the troops. Also, a Japanese warship is anchored in the Chuanshan Sea and cruises back and forth from time to time, with unclear intentions.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Famous American Clergyman Calls For US Sanctions Against Japan; The Greatest Sufferers Are The Chinese; The US Should Stop Aiding And Abetting And Stop The Atrocities <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The March issue of "The Catholic World" magazine, published in New York, published an article by the famous clergyman Rev. James M. Gillis criticizing the US policy on the Sino-Japanese War. The article stated that while Finland has been invaded and Poland has been ravaged, the greatest sufferers are actually the Chinese. In his opinion, the so-called crusaders for religious humanity, such as Britain and France, have failed to do their best to maintain justice, and the United States is also to blame. When Japan invaded the Northeast in 1931, the US authorities did make a weak protest, but since then they have claimed that Britain was unwilling to cooperate, so they did not take any action against Japan. This kind of defense is actually very hypocritical. We Americans are known as a people who pursue truth and cherish charity. We often pride ourselves on liberating South America, Cuba, and Puerto Rico from suffering.</p>
<p>Supplying Arms Is Tantamount To Aiding And Abetting</p>
<p>But the massacres of Japanese in China are ten thousand times more serious than in other countries, and we not only cannot stop these massacres, but also supply the Japanese with arms to massacre the Chinese. Our ideal humanitarian and charitable Congress is at this moment fussing over the difficulties and dangers of the United States intervening in the Sino-Japanese War. We do not need to stand up for the victims, but what we need to do is to stop aiding and abetting and stop encouraging aggression. New York is far from China and seems to have nothing to do with the war in China, but we are related to the massacre of millions of innocent Chinese. Why? Try to look at the huge amount of iron filings carried by the freight cars on the banks of the Jersey River, all of which are shipped to Japan. The iron materials after the railroad on Sixth Street is dismantled are also shipped to Japan.</p>
<p>American Arms Kill Chinese</p>
<p>When we see photos of the horrific scenes of Chinese houses and hospitals being bombed by Japanese planes in the newspapers every day, we must know that the bombs dropped by Japanese planes, as well as the bullets and tanks used by the Japanese army, are all made from American raw materials, and may even be manufactured in American factories. We are purely using economic tactics to pressure Japan to submit. The arrogant little Japan may take intimidating actions against us. However, we must know that the Chinese are still fighting bravely against Japan to this day. Can we Americans not resist the attacks of the Japanese Navy? If so, we Americans will be reduced to a country below the tenth rate.</p>
<p>Distinguish Between What Is Important</p>
<p>Gillis further said in his article that some people advocate maintaining trade with Japan and are unwilling to damage friendship with Japan, which is completely wrong. Just imagine, which is more important, New York City lacking water sources or 400 million Chinese being massacred? It is very clear. Finally, Gillis said that Americans should no longer call themselves a charitable nation, and should pray to God to forgive their sins. In his opinion, he still firmly believes that the United States will be able to stop the massacres in China without causing war.</p>

<h3 id="e63">German Ship "Lameris" Suddenly Holds Reception; German, Italian, and Japanese Residents Invited; British, French, and American Residents Did Not Attend <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Since the expansion of the European War, the German ship "Ladous" in Shanghai has been docked on the Huangpu River and has not left the port. Unexpectedly, the ship suddenly sailed into the blockade line of the 16th Pier a few days ago and docked at the Gaochang Temple side of the Huangpu River. At 12:00 noon yesterday, the ship hosted a reception for German, Italian, and Japanese residents in Shanghai. The shipowner issued hundreds of invitations in advance. However, it is known that none of the British, French, and American residents in the city received invitations. Therefore, all the guests who arrived yesterday morning were more than 300 German, Italian, and Japanese residents, who were picked up by the Japanese ship "Chunjiang Maru" at the customs pier.

The two secretly get engaged. Hua Binggang's son, Yingde, is in love with Fan Yunsheng's daughter, Fan Liqiong, but Hua Binggang also likes Liqiong. Through the enthusiastic matchmaking of the go-between, Chuan Er Niangzi, Liqiong, due to her mother's difficult life, is forced to agree to become Binggang's second wife. Binggang arranges for Yingde to marry a widow, and promises Yingmei to Fan Yunsheng, because Fan Laoxiansheng is wealthy and does not want his dowry. Thus, the father and son fight for love, and the relationships are reversed. The two sons' lovers are about to marry their respective fathers as second wives. In the end, Yingde, Liqiong, Li Han, and Yingmei, the two young lovers, are able to break the deadlock and all become couples. The plot is tight, and the performance is vivid and colorful.

<h3 id="e75">The United Education Association Issues a Letter to the Education Community on the Anti-Smoking Day: Expanding the Meaning of Anti-Smoking and Strictly Preventing Invisible Poisons <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>(Da Guang News Agency) The Shanghai Education Community United Association, for the June 3rd Anti-Smoking Memorial Day, issued a statement to the education community in this city, stating briefly: "Today is the June 3rd Anti-Smoking Memorial Day, and it is also the year that the six-year anti-smoking plan expires. We know that swallowing red pills and smoking opium can all damage our bodies, hinder our health, poison our minds, ruin our future, and destroy our entire race. These terrible consequences truly make people tremble with fear.</p>
<p>Lin Gong Zexu, with foresight and vision, on this day a hundred years ago, with a great spirit of fearlessness, burned more than 20,000 boxes of opium completely. Although Lin Zexu was dismissed and punished for this, and suffered a painful failure, the harm of opium is undeniable, and Lin Zexu's greatness cannot be denied by anyone. Since the Republic of China, although there have been discussions about banning smoking, they have been mere empty words. Only our Chairman Chiang is wise and decisive, designating June 3rd as Anti-Smoking Memorial Day and</p>
<p>Setting a Deadline for Elimination</p>
<p>This year happens to be the year the six-year anti-smoking plan expires. But since the National Army withdrew westward, some people have recklessly transported various drugs to the occupied areas, poisoning our compatriots and destroying our nearly completed plan. On the one hand, they are also implementing invisible poisons, harming the minds of our people. Their poison is actually even worse than opium. The general shameless people, blinded by greed,</p>
<p>Suffer from its poison without knowing it, which is especially heartbreaking. Therefore, the significance of commemorating Anti-Smoking Day today is not only in quitting tangible opium, but also in expanding its meaning, emulating Lin Zexu's indomitable spirit, supporting the Central Government, obeying the President, and crushing the conspiracies of these people. The responsibility of our education community is not only to cultivate talent, but also to transform customs and set an example for society. We should be in a position of foresight and awareness, starting with ourselves, so that we can extend it to others, and all poisons will be swept away cleanly."</p>

<p>The semi-finals of the International Cup Mini-Football were held at the Aurora Stadium at 3:30 PM yesterday. In the first match, England defeated Portugal 3-0. However, Portugal's offense was very strong, and Fafan Xiao missed more than ten shots on goal. Otherwise, the outcome would have been difficult to determine. In the other match, China led all the way against France. In the first half, China was ahead 2-0. France was at a loss. China scored two more goals, and eliminated France 4-1 to secure a place in the finals with England. The battle situation is as follows:</p>

<p>In the match between China and France, Zheng Tongyu, the goalkeeper of the Chinese team, was unable to play, and was replaced by Fan Jinyong of the Ge Lian team. Captain Sun led the front line, with Shen Jinda and Gao Baozheng serving as left and right forwards. The defenders were still Feng and Meng. The lineup was fairly complete. The French team, under the leadership of veteran Baoti Tuokelai, and with the help of French businessman Bakerlai, was not weak either. After the kickoff, China took the offensive. "Iron Leg" passed to Baozheng, whose shot was blocked, but he scored on a second shot. Before long, Sun "Iron Leg" made a comeback, passing left to Shen Jinda. The defender rushed out too quickly, and Shen sent the ball into the empty net to open the scoring. The French team, after losing a goal, brought in Hailayang to replace Xin Liu. Sure enough, soon after, Hailayang dribbled forward and passed to Kelai, Kelai shot and Shou was unable to save it, and a goal was lost, making it a 1-1 tie. The first half ended. After the break, the Chinese team's lineup changed slightly, with Chen Yuanji replacing Shen Jinda to increase the offense. After ten minutes, Luo Su accidentally handled the ball with his hand. Fortunately, it was far from the goal, and "Iron Leg" kicked it into the net, again giving China the advantage. Not three minutes later, Wen's was called for a personal foul. "Iron Leg" took the penalty again, which Levi received but then lost, making it 3-1. The Chinese team had an absolute advantage. The French army's actions seemed rather crude. Unfortunately, their luck was bad and they were unable to score. After twenty-two minutes, Gao Baozheng passed to Sun Jinshun, who passed the defender and went in, making it 4-1, sealing the victory. Two minutes before the end, Chen Yuanji of the Chinese team and Wen's, a defender of the French army, had a misunderstanding while fighting for the ball, and the two sides got into a fight.

In the first half, the English army's goal was scored by Jin Selai, taking a 1-0 lead. After switching sides, the Portuguese team's offense did not weaken, but they were still unable to break the duck egg record. On the contrary, they were scored on twice from afar by the English army's substitute, James Watt, resulting in a 3-0 loss, with the English army being eliminated.</p>

<p>The Youth Association, in order to actively train long-distance running talent, held a summer long-distance running training class. At 6:30 AM yesterday, they gathered at Guangxia Middle School on Moore Road to start a 3,200-meter test. Wang Zhenglin, the "freak runner," was present to guide and time the event. As a result of the competition, Wang Zhixi finished the entire course first with a time of 10 minutes and 49 seconds. It is commendable for a newcomer to achieve this result. Second place was Li Shiheng, only four seconds behind. Third place was Wang Ximing, and fourth place was Ge Yuting. Another one-mile practice session was also held at the same time. As a result, Xu Xingzhe won first place with a time of 5 minutes and 30 seconds. Second place was Yan Wenzhong, and third and fourth places were Wu Guoan and Wu Zhenxin.</p>
<p>Taifeng Transportation Company Sues Wu Linsen for Fraud: The Plaintiff Claims Repayment of 22,000 Yuan; The Defendant Fails to Appear, the Case is Postponed</p>
<p>Taifeng Transportation Company at number 20, Sijing Road, last December, due to transporting more than 3,000 pieces of cotton purchased by Defeng Spinning Factory, You Hengyuan Tai, and other companies in Jiangbei Dazhongji, believed that due to the special wartime situation at various tax checkpoints along the way, taxes could not be declared according to the usual peacetime regulations. It was necessary to find someone who had relationships with the Japanese army and guerrillas to handle it. Wu Linsen, who claimed to be the "Manager of the American Company," contacted Gao Xingwu, the manager of Taifeng Company. Wu claimed that he had real connections with the upstream guerrilla teams and the Yangtze River Japanese Army transportation management unit. He said that the company had branch offices in Taixian upstream and other ports, and that all goods transported from these places to Shanghai could have all kinds of miscellaneous fees and taxes handled and</p>
<p>Funds Advanced. Only after the goods arrived in the Shanghai concessions would the company come to collect the money, etc. At that time, Gao believed it to be true and did not suspect anything else. He then negotiated with Wu, agreeing that the goods would be transported from the port to the Shanghai concessions for delivery, with a fee of 42 yuan per piece of cotton, including all taxes and fees along the way. When Taifeng Company's cotton was transported from Dazhongji to the port, and was about to be handed over to Wu for shipment to Shanghai, Wu suddenly came to Taifeng Company and told Gao that the current situation was</p>
<p>Special, and that he must pay in advance. Gao, based on the agreement, refused to pay in advance. However, Wu repeatedly said that he must, so Gao handed over 21,000 yuan to Wu. Unexpectedly, after Wu received the money, he disappeared and could not be seen. All the offices were also closed. At this point, Gao realized that he had been deceived. Recently, Gao finally found out where Wu was hiding, and hired lawyer Zhang Danping to represent him. He filed a complaint with the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, accusing Wu of fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Law, and attached a civil lawsuit, requesting compensation of 11,000 yuan. The court approved the complaint. The previous day, Judge Zhong opened the Civil Court 8 for trial. The defendant avoided appearing, and entrusted lawyer Cai Lin to defend him. After the plaintiff's statement was recorded, the court stated that criminal defendants must appear in person. If they use excuses not to appear, the court will consider the situation and take them into custody. Therefore, the hearing was postponed to the 8th of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e88">How to Promote Foreign Trade <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>A Summary of the Minutes of a Symposium Held in Cooperation with the Economic Research Department of the Universal Trust Company</p>
<p>In these wartime times, although our country's foreign trade environment is challenging, its significance and hope are actually greater than in peacetime. The outbreak of the European war is even more beneficial to exports. However, overcoming the environment requires our efforts; and opportunities that arise should also be rationally utilized. Moreover, stabilizing the exchange rate, balancing prices, adjusting the supply and demand of materials, strengthening the war economy, and improving the national economy and people's livelihood are all related to this. At the last symposium of this publication, Mr. Wang Haibo believed that in addition to cracking down on speculation, we should also guide idle capital to legitimate outlets. Engaging in import and export business is also a worthwhile outlet for funds to be studied. Mr. Wang Haibo is one of the few domestic economists who has become an import and export entrepreneur. He is full of knowledge and experience and is very interested in this. Therefore, the Economic Research Department of the American Universal Trust Company, under his leadership, initiated a collaboration with this publication to invite government officials, merchants, bankers, national goods industrialists, and economists with special research on international trade in this city to hold a joint symposium in order to gather ideas and conduct academic discussions. We are deeply honored to have received the presence of various predecessors in person or through representatives, who shared their insightful opinions. We are also deeply grateful for the support and cooperation of Mr. Wang Haibo and the Economic Research Department of the Universal Trust Company under his leadership in preparing and conducting this symposium.</p>
<p>However, due to the limited position of this publication, we can only provide a summary of the key points of the insightful opinions expressed by all attendees. We are grateful for your personal revisions, which allow us to retain the essence. We are especially fortunate that this issue will contain the first part, and the next issue will continue to complete it. It is said that the "Daily Economic Monthly," edited by Mr. Wang Haibo, will publish a special issue on foreign trade in July of this year, from which the whole picture can be seen, which readers will be happy to hear.</p>
<p>Date: May 12, 29th year [of the Republic], from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM</p>
<p>Location: 5th Floor Hall, Bank Association, No. 59 Hong Kong Road</p>
<p>Chairman: Mr. Wang Haibo Stenographer: Mr. Shen Wenbin</p>

<p>Opening Remarks</p>
<p>Chairman: ... The motivation for today's meeting stems from the belief, expressed during the "Shanghai Market Self-Management" symposium of the Shen Bao Economic Special Issue, that the total amount of idle capital in Shanghai is at least 300 million; and that this idle capital is all engaged in speculative activities such as hoarding goods and purchasing gold and foreign exchange. It is very difficult to manage this, because the purpose of speculation is nothing more than to make money; and it is ineffective to persuade them with passive moral methods. Therefore, at that time, I proposed guiding idle capital to legitimate outlets; if idle capital can find legitimate outlets, it may not blindly follow. I also believe that one of the outlets for idle capital is to engage in import and export business. However, import and export business is by no means as simple as speculating in foreign exchange and gold; anyone can act blindly. Promoting international trade, in terms of exports, aims to obtain foreign exchange and strengthen national power; in terms of imports, how to exchange for daily necessities and essential raw materials for domestic goods manufacturing in the most economical way. Now that the situation in Europe is urgent, and Italy and the United States may join the war, the source of foreign goods is even more threatened. Therefore, in our import statements, we must also seize the opportunity to actively imitate and manufacture in order to revitalize our country's industry. All of this is inextricably linked to production technology, financial turnover, transportation issues, and overseas markets. It is imperative that people with status and knowledge in society, as well as leaders in various industries, come forward to promote and lead, and point out a bright path; so that a group of people can follow suit and move forward together. Today's attendees are all economic experts and leaders in various industries; it is hoped that through different perspectives, some good methods can be discussed. This is not only a benefit to the industrial and commercial sectors, but also a great contribution to the national economy and people's livelihood.</p>
<p>International Trade and the National Economy</p>
<p>Chairman: Since May 2nd, the exchange rate has plummeted again, causing changes in prices and various economic sectors. Also, according to yesterday's newspaper, the figures released by the foreign exchange authority show that 90% of our country's foreign exchange is used for international trade. Although this does not mean that exchange rate fluctuations are directly due to international trade, no one can deny the significant relationship between the two. According to various newspapers, our country's international trade in the first quarter of this year showed a surplus; but this is based on the official exchange rate. If calculated at the black market exchange rate, the trade deficit is truly alarming. What is the impact of this on the national economy? Are there any remedial measures? Let's discuss this.</p>
<p>Lu Zhixue: The customs report shows a surplus, but calculated at the market exchange rate, it is a deficit.</p>
<p>Zhang Yifan: The balance of international payments should be calculated based on the black market rate. Commodity trade should be calculated based on the legal exchange rate in order to deduct the impact of prices and study the true state of supply and demand.</p>
<p>Yao Qingzhi (Chairman): Everyone, I would like to make an opening statement before discussing this topic; I find today's topic of discussion very interesting. In the past ten years, China's economic thought has been partly influenced by Soviet socialism and partly by German fascism. The general public hopes for self-sufficiency in international trade. This idea of self-sufficiency is worth promoting in wartime, but it is unacceptable in peacetime. We know that international trade is, in principle, nothing more than international division of labor and cooperation, and mutual exchange. Therefore, if countries can truly engage in reasonable transactions under conditions of equality and mutual benefit, it will be beneficial and harmless to both parties. Why does Europe have to go to war? Is it impossible to solve the problem without war? This is worth our attention. Why did Germany create this European war? The underlying reasons are nothing more than to seize markets and compete for raw materials. However, if surplus production has an international market for public sales, and if raw materials are lacking, they can also be purchased from the international market. Then Germany, at least economically, has no need to engage in aggression. As for Britain and France, they have colonies, raw materials are easy to buy, and products are easy to sell, so they naturally feel satisfied. However, since the Ottawa Imperial Conference, Britain has implemented preferential tariffs for various parts of the British Empire; France has also implemented the same policy since the economic crisis. This makes it difficult for goods from other countries to compete with British and French goods within the colonies of the British and French Empires, and they also lack purchasing power to purchase the required raw materials within the colonies of the British and French Empires. In this regard, Britain and France are also to blame for the long-term cause of this European war. In short, if countries can adopt a more liberal attitude in their trade policies, it is the best basis for international peace. In recent years, U.S. Secretary of State Hull has vigorously promoted reciprocal trade agreements, and President Roosevelt has recently advocated that economic reconstruction after the war should be based on liberal trade policies. The essence of this is also here. Therefore, I believe that international trade should adopt a more liberal approach in peacetime; economic self-sufficiency should be promoted in wartime, but it is impossible in peacetime. Even if it is forced, it will be at a great sacrifice. For example, Germany ignores natural rubber and engages in artificial rubber, and its cost is more expensive than the original. This is the general situation. Regarding the result of international trade, it is also worth exploring whether a trade deficit is unacceptable. I think this point should also be discussed separately. If the reason for this trade deficit is to use foreign capital for national economic development, then it does not matter, because the inflow of foreign capital is tantamount to a surplus in intangible trade; if it can offset the deficit in tangible trade, then the balance of international payments can still be balanced, and the exchange rate can still be stabilized. Therefore, under such circumstances, a trade deficit is not a problem at all. However, this is not the case in Shanghai under the current environment, because the trade deficit in tangible trade is not only not offset by the inflow of foreign capital, but is exacerbated by the flight of capital, which greatly threatens the stability of the exchange rate. This is a very dangerous phenomenon.</p>
<p>The outbreak of the Second European War has brought about tremendous changes in our country's national tribute trade; in the past, Germany ranked third in our country's total imports, but since the outbreak of the European War, there have been very few imports; especially machinery and various chemicals are simply not available. In addition, imports of goods from Britain, France, and other European belligerent or neutral countries have also gradually decreased; therefore, we have to change our route and import from the United States. As for exports, due to the fall in the exchange rate of the legal currency, they have increased instead. The sales of domestic goods in the Nanyang area have made significant progress. Not only is this the case in Nanyang, but it has also expanded to India; such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, undershirts, handkerchiefs, socks, and the like, the sales volume is very considerable. Our country's rubber overshoes have even been sold to Britain and France, which is a groundbreaking record in the history of exports. These are all very favorable phenomena.</p>
<p>In this process, there is also a characteristic that is worth our attention; that is, in the past, our country's international trade has always been controlled by foreigners; the reason for this is that the Chinese people are not familiar with foreign conditions, so this is not only the case for imports, but also for exports. However, this is now slowly shifting to the hands of the Chinese people. The number of Chinese firms engaged in import and export is increasing day by day. This is a very good opportunity to make the right of international trade belong to ourselves, because if we want to buy German pigments, the internal situation cannot be more detailed than that of German merchants with a long history. Now that German goods cannot come, we have to buy from the United States; we are indeed laymen, but foreign merchants are also laymen like us; we can compete with them. This is an improvement in imports due to changes in the international environment; the situation is naturally the same for exports. Therefore, at this time, there are many benefits in the international trade mechanism. Mr. Wang Haibo is not only a theorist, but also a practitioner; I hope that Mr. Wang will lead and promote so that all import and export businesses can be controlled by the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Lu Zhixue: This problem should be discussed in two points. Shanghai and the mainland cannot be generalized... If we drastically reduce the things we use ourselves, we can definitely turn the trade deficit into a trade surplus. But the problem of Shanghai's trade deficit is difficult to solve because most of the things we use rely on foreign sources. For example, the raw material tallow for the Huan Factory Solid Soap used to be purchased from Qingdao, Bengbu, and other places, and foreign goods were never used. Now, because these places have fallen, we have to buy from Australia; we must use foreign exchange. In the past, tallow was 13-14 yuan per ton, but recently it has reached more than 90 yuan. Another example is that rosin must be bought from the United States. Wooden box boards used to come from Wenzhou and Hangzhou, and the price was very cheap; now that there are few imports, the price is also expensive. Although prices in the mainland are expensive, raw materials are available everywhere; therefore, it is easier to increase production and adjust trade than in Shanghai. Mr. Yao said that the policy of "self-sufficiency" is impossible. I have some objections, because in the present, if we are not self-sufficient, there will be more difficulties. If we force it, it will certainly not be economical, but for the sake of the country, the things that must be needed, we must buy what we must buy, and make what we can make, regardless of the price or the manufacturing cost...</p>
<p>Our Country's Current Trade Environment</p>
<p>Chairman: Now our country and Europe are in a period of war, and in the future, the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean may be involved in the whirlpool at any time. International trade in wartime naturally has many special circumstances. At present, the two major problems that import and export merchants feel most severely are foreign exchange and transportation. Fluctuations in foreign exchange cause risks to arise. Transportation blockages and shortages of cabin space further hinder cargo transportation. Under the circumstances of internal and external wars, how can our country's international trade be maintained, and how can it be maintained? Please express your valuable opinions.</p>
<p>Yu Zhongkui: According to the current situation, there is really no way; so it is difficult to discuss.</p>
<p>Zhang Yifan: When the European War just started, people were very panicked, thinking that Europe and the United States would withdraw from the Far East market; and that there would be no ships to transport import and export goods; in addition, they were all in the hands of the Japanese. Later, when the war was not tense, various countries were relieved that trade with China was as usual. Recently, there has been talk of Britain and France only going around the Cape of Good Hope, and panic has risen again. In fact, after the expansion of the European War, is it really impossible to reach China? This depends on whether they can be self-sufficient? In fact, they must come to China to buy raw materials, so it will not be impossible to come. This is certainly not a real solution, but it is clear that trade and transportation can be maintained.</p>
<p>Li Zufan: Because foreign countries need China's raw materials, even if the European War expands again, ships will still come, but the reduction in capacity is inevitable, so it will affect the source of cheap and bulky things. In other words, expensive and small things may still be able to maintain transportation, but cheap and bulky things will have problems. For example, "coal" used to be only ten to dozens of yuan per ton, but after the outbreak of the European war, the price immediately rose, but the producing place, such as India, still only sells for nine rupees, while the freight costs five or six times. In the past, "coal" was a very small problem for various factories, but now it is considered absolutely serious. Europe and the United States need our raw materials, so ships will definitely come, but China, in addition to the supply of minerals and vegetable oils, still needs more from others. The reason why American ships are unwilling to increase their voyages to the Far East is also because there is more cargo coming than going, which cannot be balanced. This will be a very serious problem in the future. The main raw material alkali for chemical industries such as soap making is supplied by the ICI (Imperial Chemical Industries) Company, but since the recent sudden change in the European war and the danger in the Mediterranean, they have refused to sell because there is no doubt that the future source will be lacking, and British ships have to detour around the Cape of Good Hope. In this way, the time is extended and the freight increases, so there must be many similar problems. The supply of raw materials is now a major problem. In addition to the transportation problem, the unstable exchange rate makes it impossible to calculate the cost of international trade at all, because a batch of orders takes at least two or three months, and it is impossible to estimate the extent of its changes during this period. For example, the flour used by our factory used to come from Canada for a period of time. Later, because the foreign exchange was expensive, we switched to using Chinese goods—the quality was slightly worse—once, the foreign exchange was loose and the domestic goods were not enough, so we went to buy from foreign countries again, but when it arrived, the market price was already different. Although our factory settled the foreign exchange early, there was no problem, but the instability of the foreign exchange is indeed one of the biggest obstacles to international trade.</p>
<p>Wu Yugan: Regarding the transportation problem, in addition to "ships," I think there are more difficult and serious problems. Before the war, Shanghai was the center of China's international trade. After the withdrawal of the national army to the west, the ports of Guangzhou Bay, Haiphong, and Wenzhou became international roads, and Hong Kong became the trade center. Later, due to the once tense relations between Britain and Japan, there was talk of a blockade of Hong Kong. Later, because the situation gradually eased, there was no change, but it is difficult to predict the future. Therefore, it is not a question of whether "ships" will come or not. We know that there are two other international routes in the southwest and northwest, but the actual situation of cargo transportation cannot be determined. I hope that those from the mainland will report some of the information they know.</p>
<p>Zhang Yifan: Assuming that transportation becomes a problem, the industrial and commercial sectors will indeed have difficulties. The government always has more ways than private individuals, so it is better to hand over the export business to the state for operation, which will be more convenient than private individuals handling it alone.</p>
<p>Promoting Trade and Finance</p>
<p>Chairman: The financial sector is closely related to import and export trade; this is true in peacetime, and even more so in times of crisis. How should the financial sector assist traders to benefit both the public and private sectors? Let's discuss this.</p>
<p>Gan Dounan: The financial sector and the industrial sector must be united. There is not much contact between them now. The financial sector does not lend to manufacturers, but operates other businesses for two reasons: (1) credit is easy to investigate; (2) speculative businesses are more profitable. If this continues, it will not only be a disaster for the financial and industrial sectors, but also not a way to promote trade. I advocate that the banking industry should unite to assist the only remaining national industries. Suppose a factory receives an order worth 30,000 yuan, but cannot accept it due to insufficient funds without the help of a bank, and will inevitably miss the opportunity. The financial sector may worry that someone will use the order to borrow money from several banks at the same time and use it for other purposes. The preventive method is for the financial sector to jointly organize a foreign trade registration office; its task is that when the industrial sector or exporters borrow money from the financial sector, they must first register with the office, and the office will issue a registration certificate, based on which they can borrow money from the financial sector; all those responsible in the office can only issue a registration certificate for the same order or bill of exchange once; and the financial sector can consult the registration office at any time, and the above-mentioned drawbacks may be eliminated invisibly.</p>
<p>Nie Guangdi: After receiving an export order, you should buy raw materials, otherwise, there is no danger in market fluctuations, so you need a sum of money. If the funds are not sufficient, you have to borrow money from the bank; if the bank is unwilling to lend, you can't do it; if you can't do it, you will have less foreign exchange... In the British colonies, they don't allow you to easily ship things there, the reason is nothing more than to maintain their own foreign exchange, so after receiving an order, we should first ask whether it can be imported? If it can be imported, we can think of cooperating with their corresponding banks in Shanghai, London, and other places, and rely on their strength to purchase raw materials. However, it is best to cooperate with Chinese commercial banks. Assuming that this can be done, foreign trade will definitely be much larger than it is now. Recently, two friends told me that foreign banks can lend money to those with good credit first, but not everyone can do it. We hope that Chinese commercial banks will do it themselves, especially for the help of exporters, which can enable our country to obtain more foreign exchange.</p>

<p>The Wuxi Rice Market has been short of rice boats recently due to the spring cocoons entering the market, and the inventory has been gradually reduced. Some shops have successively replenished their stocks in the market and sold them in separate packages. The market price is firm. High-quality white japonica rice is 33.2 yuan per stone, white japonica rice for retail is 32 yuan, high-quality brown rice is 10 yuan, high-quality japonica rice is 15.3 yuan per dan, white rice is 31 yuan per stone, and Yuan rice is 15 yuan. There is very little Yangxian and Dazi rice. High-quality white Yangjian rice is 34-5 yuan per stone, and white Dazi rice also needs 33-4 yuan. The Xian rice market is smooth. It is hoped that the arrival of Wanlu Xian rice will ease the supply and the price will fall.</p>
<p>New wheat has entered the market in Xiyi. Old wheat will be extinct. However, there is no formal large market for new wheat. Small machine mills are trying to make it for 32-33 yuan per bag. After the silkworm season, most of them will be harvested and enter the market after the Dragon Boat Festival. The supply will inevitably surge. However, the bottom price this year is too high, making it difficult to start. New Yuan wheat from Nanjing is coming in steadily, at more than 21 yuan per stone, and the quality is still good. There is a limited amount of old flour. New flour will be available in about twenty days. It once rose to 13.67 yuan per bag, almost balancing with Shanghai flour. The number of flour mills has increased this year, and there will inevitably be differences in the market price of wheat and flour.</p>
<p>The weighing of spring cocoons in Xiyi has been going on for three or four days. Because there are too many small cocoon shops, they indiscriminately accept and release orders, resulting in a high price of 400 yuan per dan. The other day, some small cocoon shops temporarily stopped weighing. The "China Central Company" controlled various cocoon shops and also started to accept goods. Although the recent silk price has reached more than 5,000 yuan, cocoon merchants still have a bullish mentality. However, with the unpredictable changes in the European war and the major crisis in the future of silk prices, small cocoon shops have stopped accepting goods, also feeling that cocoon prices are too high and the future is dangerous. A certain cocoon shop in Nanxiang has collected more than 100,000 pieces, but has also stopped buying due to high costs. This year's cocoons are of very good quality due to the dry weather. Generally, the drying loss is only 280 catties, and the reeling loss can be within 400 catties. (Good)</p>

<p>Golden needle vegetables were once seen loosening, but now, as the market has become more active, the price has turned tight.

<p>Sugar prices showed mixed fluctuations, with small ups and downs. The association's opening price for spot goods was 71.5 yuan for No. 24 coarse white sugar in the main warehouse. The initial price for new foreign goods in foreign warehouses was 71 yuan to 70.9 yuan, but later it rose back to 71.2 yuan. Small triangle, old goods were 70.3 yuan to 70.5 yuan, transit goods were 57.5 yuan, then to 57.6 yuan to 57.7 yuan, and later even to 58 yuan, up by half a yuan. Taikoo white B mark was 82.5 yuan, small five jiao, HX mark was 81.5 yuan, and the prices of car red and red lotus remained unchanged. The local factory's snow white was 72 yuan, and the wood ice was slightly looser than before, with No. 1 at 92.5 yuan, No. 2 at 92 yuan, and crystal clear ice at 94 yuan.</p>

<p>Although the white coal business is in the summer season, sales are gradually declining, but there are many ships arriving with goods, and customer orders are still coming in an endless stream. Yesterday, a certain company arrived with more than 360 tons of Tongdeli white coal, which has already been unloaded and put on the wharf. Fellow traders still opened at the old price of 210 yuan, but the goods in the hands of hoarders can be 7-8 jiao cheaper than the market price.

<p>— Feng</p>
<p>The Shanghai broadcloth market is undoubtedly the central hub of the entire country. Merchants from all regions and routes invariably come to Shanghai for business. Examining the sales of broadcloth, there have been significant changes from the past to the present. Starting from the fifth year of the Republic [1916], merchants from various parts of South and North China came to Shanghai one after another to establish firms and purchase broadcloth. Around the seventh and eighth years of the Republic [1918-1919], the sales of broadcloth became even more prosperous, and the number of merchants and firms established in Shanghai increased. The North China merchants (including those from Manchuria) were the most active in purchasing, and their firms were mostly located at Yi Shun Heng, Yi Shun Sheng, Yong Feng, Shi Yi Tang, etc. The South China merchants mostly set up shop within the Guangdong, Ji, and Chao firms. The Guangdong merchants came to Shanghai mainly to purchase woolen cloth and mostly resided in the Hongkou Tiantong area (commonly known as Guangdong Street), often within general fruit stores. They mostly sold bananas and sugarcane to purchase broadcloth for return to Guangdong, and the business was substantial. The Shantou and Xiamen merchants mostly purchased mixed broadcloth and “lanhu” broadcloth. The firms of the Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan merchants mostly gathered in Da Chuan Tong, Tai Gu Yu, Yi He Yu, Zhao Shang Yu, Ji Xing, Hui Ji Xing, Xiang Yu Gong, and Yi Ji Zhan, etc. The Changsha merchants mostly gathered between Xiang Yi Gong and the Changsha Commercial Guild. Other merchants from places such as Peiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, Hankou, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Jiangxi, Nanchang, Xi'an, and Dalian, were mostly associated with commercial guilds if they were run by northerners, and those run by southerners mostly operated within well-known Shanghai firms. However, among these northern and southern merchants, many rented houses in alleys such as Taiping Fang, Weishui Fang, Ju Fang, Jinghe Li, and Taozhu Li. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Securities: New York Stocks</p>
<p>A dispatch from New York on the 2nd: The stock market today experienced mixed trading with a slight decline. Trading was quiet, primarily due to many speculators in the financial district still being on holiday, awaiting the decision on Italy's entry into the war. The declines in stocks were mostly minor. Although the steel industry's operating rate is expected to increase next week, steel stocks also declined. Copper stocks, however, were supported by expectations of war orders. The Federal Reserve Board announced a decrease of $53 million in broker loans, totaling a decrease of $108 million over the past two weeks. This reflects the recent unloading of positions by weak bulls and indicates that stocks are now held by strong hands.</p>
<p>Rubber</p>
<p>A dispatch from New York on the 2nd: Rubber prices rose due to increased insurance premiums and concerns about the situation in the Dutch East Indies. Short covering reappeared, leading to a rise on Monday. The International Rubber Restriction Committee released its monthly statistics for April, showing a permitted net export of 103,813 tons, inventories of 21,183 tons, and 188,000 tons in transit at sea. Total absorption was 97,649 tons, and the net export from the Golden Ball was 113,047 tons.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>A dispatch from Chicago on the 2nd: A private estimate for the wheat market projects a total production of 720 million bushels. Increased war risk premiums for goods shipped eastward via the Suez Canal, along with a lack of exports and very favorable crop weather, have largely dampened bullish sentiment. However, a strong telegram from Winnipeg today helped stabilize the market somewhat. Prices rose slightly.</p>

<p>After the Westerners climbed over the wall and exited, they went directly to the side of the main road and saw that it was made of wood. Soldiers were guarding and patrolling everywhere along the road. When they were seen by the soldiers, they were all very angry! Some forcefully tried to pull someone away, while others said that the Emperor's procession had already passed, so there was no need to spy. Someone stood firm and did not respond, only saying that hiding behind the wall could do no harm. Soon after, two servants also arrived, looking anxious and exasperated. They grabbed someone's hand and said, "We should leave this place quickly; that's the best course of action." Someone comforted them and said, "Why don't you two also take a look here? I assure you it's harmless." The servants said they absolutely did not want to watch; the joy in the eyes is limited, but the pain to the neck is infinite. At that moment, someone noticed a small hole in the wall and immediately focused their attention on it, ignoring what others were saying. They faintly heard the sound of rumbling carts and saw many heavily loaded vehicles passing by in a disorderly manner. They glimpsed several people on horseback, wearing long red coats and yellow hats, galloping past. Officials of the Imperial Guards followed. At this point, someone strained their eyes and saw clumsy carts arriving in succession, and soldiers in red coats also passed by on horseback in droves. Manchu archers followed, with large bows and quivers full of arrows. Their clothing was of various colors—blue, white, yellow, and black—and their steps were not very uniform. When someone saw the yellow parasol approaching in the distance, they knew that the Emperor's arrival was imminent. The Emperor was in a sedan chair, carried respectfully by eight people. The Empress Dowager and concubines were all in yellow carriages. The Empress Dowager sat upright in her carriage, looking healthy and composed. The Emperor was wearing a blue robe.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Black Rice and White Rice <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>Written for the 6/3 Commemoration Day</p>
<p>People mired in the black register [opium addicts] would rather go without white rice than spend a day without black rice (opium). At night, a lamp flickers as they indulge in their habit! Caressing their concubines on the left and holding their jade pipes on the right, they inhale and exhale, finding joy in their habit. No matter how expensive opium becomes, rising from three or four yuan per tael to fifty or sixty yuan per tael, the addicts do not bat an eye! They come out looking three parts human and seven parts ghost, truly terrifying!</p>
<p>Since the withdrawal of the National Revolutionary Army from the west, the poisonous atmosphere has filled the alleys of this isolated island. Those profiting from the national crisis build high walls and dig deep moats around themselves, turning day into night and night into a painting in their bright and clean boudoirs, dedicating their precious time and money to the sound of inhalations... And then there are the penniless wretches who cannot afford black rice, hiding under every wall and in every corner, smoking red pills and swallowing white powder... These... are all reflections of the poisonous schemes of a nation and a race facing ruin.</p>
<p>In the occupied cities, opium dens and opium shops are even more ubiquitous, luring well-meaning compatriots into the dark and sunken sea of misery. The interiors of these opium dens are exquisitely furnished, with painted and powdered she-devils there to provide entertainment. Once you fall into this trap, how can you find your way back? Even in the so-called "paradise" of this isolated hellhole, besides gambling and drinking, black rice and women are the sole poisons that will destroy your wealth and your life. Yet, how many who enter there can turn back? News reports are increasingly filled with stories of suicide and imprisonment, which is truly lamentable!</p>
<p>On the other hand, the poor, struggling to survive, face the terror of not having enough white rice, let alone black rice! Whether it is foreign rice or Du rice, sold by the measure, it still costs five or six dollars to fill their stomachs. How can the laborers who earn only meager wages through their labor and sweat afford this? Their wives cry, their children wail, making it no different from a hell on earth.</p>
<p>Today is the "6/3 Commemoration Day" of Commissioner Lin Zexu's opium prohibition. I hope that the leisurely class who have money to smoke black rice will make a painful effort to quit. Then, put down the butcher's knife and start anew as a complete person, diverting the money saved from quitting to disaster relief funds and to helping the poor, so that after freeing themselves from the sea of misery, they can also help those truly good people who do not have "white rice to eat." Wouldn't that be a cause for great joy?</p>
<h3 id="e99">My Views on Improving Men's Summer Clothing <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Jiu</p>
<p>In this era of expensive goods and the need to economize on both time and money, we feel that the Youth Association's call for design submissions and advocacy is something everyone is eagerly awaiting.</p>
<p>In the past, there have been several attempts to improve men's summer clothing, but their results have been, as Mr. Er Dong said, "due to poor planning, they soon faded into obscurity." I believe that this poor planning is not simply due to those responsible failing to take the lead or neglecting the actual circumstances of the masses; at least part of the reason is this.</p>
<p>The main purpose of summer clothing is to be lightweight and cool. No one can deny that the complexity of Western suits and the cumbersome nature of long robes make them unsuitable for summer wear. I remember that some people once advocated using the existing styles of work clothes and school uniforms to make changes, but this ultimately failed to arouse public sympathy. The reason for this is very simple: work clothes, children's clothes, and school uniforms still cling to the body and are just as troublesome to wear as Western suits. Moreover, most people are accustomed to wearing loose-fitting Chinese clothing, so any alteration makes them feel unnatural in their movements. Therefore, I believe that improving men's summer clothing should at least take the majority of the masses into consideration. The most effective and acceptable method, I suggest, is to modify Chinese-style clothing.</p>
<p>Modifying Chinese-style clothing not only caters to the public's psychology, but also suits the current economic conditions, when silk and cloth prices are so high that people dare not even ask about them. Now, making a new set of clothes, using even the cheapest spun silk, will cost at least ten dollars. If the modified style can be cut from existing old clothes, I think it can overcome all the difficulties mentioned above.</p>
<p>In addition, we feel that wearing shorts and going barefoot in the summer is also very necessary and worth advocating. When improving summer clothing, it seems that this point should also be taken into consideration.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Residences and Flowers <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Western people's residences are most concerned with decoration and arrangement, almost every room has several pots or bottles of flowers to embellish, and naturally feel vibrant and pleasing to the eye. Only our Chinese residences do not pay attention to this. Needless to say, poor families are like this, and most wealthy families are also like this; except when there is some celebration at home, or on days when guests are entertained, some flowers are casually put into vases. On ordinary days, you simply cannot see the shadow of flowers, so there is no vitality at all. I recently visited a literary friend and saw that his study was bright, clean, and spotless, and the most rare thing was that the bonsai was arranged on the desks, tea tables, and even the window sills, making me extremely envious. I asked him if he made them himself? He said that he did not have the skill to make bonsai, and that they were made by an expert, Mr. Kong Zhiqing. I feel that the three characters Kong Zhiqing are familiar, and I seem to have seen them in the newspaper, but it was the first time I had seen the bonsai he made, which was truly ingenious. Immediately I made a decision, I must organize my messy study well, and the first step is to ask Mr. Kong to make some bonsai for me. So I asked my literary friend for Mr. Kong's address, and it is said to be at No. 1 Sapo Road, where a bonsai exhibition is being held these days." This is indeed a coincidence, and I must visit it.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Solving the Problem of Carrying Lunch <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Sun</p>
<p>Since the cost of living has increased, rice sells for fifty yuan per dan [a unit of dry volume], and coal briquettes sell for over eighty-eight yuan per hundred jin [a unit of weight], those on salary feel deeply distressed. In particular, it is even more difficult for the small clerks in modern commercial firms who provide lunch. Eating three bowls of white rice in a small restaurant costs thirty cents, and a bowl of tofu soup costs over ten cents, so each meal costs at least forty cents to fill your stomach. However, the dishwater in the small restaurants makes you want to vomit for three days, and the gas, oil, and sweaty smells make people even more uncomfortable. Therefore, I decided to bring my own lunch. I spent a lot of time considering the container for carrying the lunch. At first, I wanted to use a lunch box or a hand-carried rice pot like the Huzhou silk weavers, but I felt that using the above-mentioned containers would be embarrassing, especially for those of us who wear long gowns. In today's snobbish world, I am afraid that carrying a rice pot in the morning and evening would be ridiculed by others, and cold rice and cold dishes are not suitable for those who use their brains to work. Finally, I thought of using two-pound wide-mouth thermos bottles, one for hot rice and the other for hot soup and dishes. For the convenience of carrying, I made a hand-carried wooden box according to the size of the two thermos bottles, like a schoolboy's hand-carried bag. It is convenient to carry, and the thermos bottles are not easily broken. The rice can be cooked on a coal briquette stove in the morning while washing up, until it is 80% done, and then it can be put into the thermos bottle. The soup and dishes are also cooked and put into the bottle. The time spent cooking rice and dishes is less than ten minutes. At lunchtime, you can have hot soup and hot rice. In summer, if you cook it the night before and put it in, it can also keep warm until lunch the next day. The cost of each meal is only about twenty-five cents. I have been doing this for almost a year, and many colleagues have followed my method. Although the price of thermos bottles is expensive now, each one costs four yuan and a few corners, if you follow the above method, it will cost ten yuan to handle, and it can be saved in three months. Now that the weather is getting hot, it is not economical or hygienic to go to small restaurants. If there are any like-minded people who feel that life is not easy, you may wish to try it according to my description.</p>
<h3 id="e102">The Daily Life of Italy's Mussolini <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Maode</p>
<p>Amidst the tense European situation, the attitude of Italy is the first thing to note, and Italy's fate is controlled by Mussolini alone. After all, Mr. Mo is a hero of his time. In the European era of peace, he disregarded everything and launched the East African campaign. Now that Britain and France have suffered great military setbacks, how can they not take advantage of the situation? Therefore, Mussolini's every move is enough to attract the attention of the world. Now I will record some about his daily life.</p>
<p>Mussolini is the Prime Minister of Italy. Although he receives an annual salary of 96,000 lire, his life is simple and thrifty, no less than that of ordinary people. Moreover, the autobiography he wrote sold for 5,000 pounds in royalties in the United States, which were all donated to the poor in Rome.</p>
<p>Mussolini is already fifty-seven years old this year. Although he is an old man who has been struggling for a long time, because his daily life, diet, office work, and entertainment are orderly and regular, he still possesses the energy and spirit of a young man. He has a completely optimistic attitude.</p>
<p>Mussolini gets up every morning before six o'clock, rides a horse for an hour, and then goes to the washing room to groom himself before having breakfast; coffee and fruit are his favorite foods. After the meal, he begins to read private letters and newspapers. At nine o'clock, he goes to the State Council office—his office is just a large room with no furnishings. There, at the semi-new and old desk, he meets with the seven people who hold the six ministerial posts he concurrently holds and the chief of staff of the party army, listens to reports from all parties, and then instructs the decisions that can change the fate of millions of people.</p>
<p>At twelve o'clock, he goes home for lunch. The dishes are very simple, consisting of only some soup or gravy, bread, coffee, and some fruit. After lunch, he plays with his several nieces and his youngest daughter. When playing, whether it is tug-of-war, skipping rope, stacking sandbags, or building bridges, he even has to play the violin when he is happy. After that, he meets with general private relatives and people from all aspects of society, as the object of his administration.</p>
<p>At four o'clock, he goes to the State Council office to meet with diplomatic envoys and important foreign guests, or sometimes gives speeches to the public. At about nine o'clock, he goes home for dinner, which is richer than lunch. After the meal, he retreats to the study to read, meditate, or write, etc. When he is happy, he shows a few films at home that are never made public, or dances with a sword for half an hour, but he does not drink or smoke. He can only fall asleep when he is tired.</p>
<p>In short, Mussolini works very hard every day, doing nine hours of official business. In emergencies, he has to do more, sleeping only six hours a day on average, and his enjoyment of daily life is extremely simple and civilianized, but his physique can still be compared to a heavy bull, and he starts his arduous work again every day.</p>
<p>Heavenly Chef Recipe (16)</p>
<h3 id="e103">(29) Stir-fried Hollow Tofu (One of the Best Summer Dishes) <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Preparation: Tofu, fermented bean curd juice, MSG, pickled ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil.</p>
<p>Preparation Method: First, put a pot of clear water on the stove and bring it to a boil over high heat. Add several large pieces of tofu one by one. Wait until it boils for 30 minutes and the tofu has all puffed up into a honeycomb shape, then remove it and place it in a basket to drain off the water. Cut it into tofu shreds. At the same time, cut the pickled ginger into thin strips. Discard the boiling water in the pot, wipe it dry, pour in some vegetable oil, and wait for the oil to heat up. Then, add the tofu shreds and ginger strips one after another, and quickly stir-fry with a spatula. After a while, add an appropriate amount of fermented bean curd juice, MSG, and soy sauce (the amount of soy sauce should be based on each person's taste). Then, stir and mix quickly with a spatula. After all the ingredients are evenly mixed, you can put them in a bowl, and then drizzle a few drops of sesame oil. It is most suitable for serving with rice in the summer, and it is also hygienic.</p>

<p>— Ms. Yi Ying</p>
<p>The shad these days are terribly expensive, costing two dimes per ounce! Even if I love to eat it, I really can't afford it. Having no alternative, I will eat dried fish. Moreover, the dried fish these days are unexpectedly cheap, only two or three cents per ounce, so when to eat if not now? Dried fish is very delicious and can be said to be no less than shad. Whether it is braised in soy sauce or stewed, it is very delicious! Especially stewed, just put a few pieces of diced pork fat and a little sweet sauce, scallions, and ginger, and it tastes almost the same as shad, the only difference is that the scale part of the shad is not so fat and beautiful. However, two dimes an ounce and two or three cents an ounce are almost ten times different, so for the sake of economy, let’s abandon that and take this.</p>

<p>We all know the stars and love the stars. Children look up at the stars in the sky, feeling a bit curious. Scientists gaze at the sky with telescopes, feeling even more curious, because they know more about how strange the stars are than children do. Jesus compared himself to a star, saying, "I am the bright morning star." What did he mean? What is the relationship between stars and us? First, stars are guides. In ancient times, before the invention of the compass, the only guide for sailors sailing in the ocean was the stars. Even the large ships of today cannot travel so quickly and safely without the stars indicating the direction in the sky. Life is like a sea, and all the people in the world are ships on this sea of life. Some encounter danger as soon as they set sail, some set out on a sunny day and have smooth sailing all the way, but later unfortunately hit a rock or run aground on a beach. Still others are battered by winds and waves and carried off course by strong currents, but in the end, they arrive safely at their destination. In this sense, if we want this ship of life to sail safely in the sea, we must have a guiding star to guide our journey. We want our bodies, memories, thoughts, and imaginations to be guided correctly, so that we do not go astray. Then, the only appropriate guiding star is the words and example of Jesus. Second, the movement of the stars. At night, we look up at the stars in the sky, and when we look again in the middle of the night, we can see that the position of the stars has changed greatly. Those in the west have disappeared, those above our heads have moved to the west, and those in the east have moved above our heads. It seems as if the stars are moving, but in reality, it is not the stars that are moving, but us people on earth, who are moving because of the rotation of the earth. God is the same to us. Sometimes God seems very close to us, and at that time our faith is firm, our love is warm, and we recognize that God is with us. Other times, it seems as if God has left us and is no longer close to us. In fact, it is not that God has left us, but that we have distanced ourselves from God, because God is in the past, in the present, and will be forever. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e106">Mr. Bryan's Salary Check <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Crarroll D. Alcott, Translated by Li Ren from the Continental News</p>
<p>The Municipal Council has announced that in order to retain the services of Mr. Robert T. Bryan, Jr., the Council's lawyer, it must pay an annual salary of US$7,500. Bryan has his special talents, namely a thorough knowledge of Chinese civil and criminal law, so he is seen as important to the Municipal Council. But whether Bryan's importance is worth paying an annual salary of US$7,500 in these difficult times is something that many people will question. When you consider that 3,000 laborers in the Municipal Council's Works Department went on strike for a daily wage increase of about 20 cents (later increased by 18 cents, amounting to an annual increase of US$3.40 per person), you have to wonder whether the Municipal Council's salary policies are still appropriate.</p>
<p>Of course, the Council will say that you can find many laborers for a few dollars, but senior officials are hard to find. This is true, but only to a certain extent. For myself, I never deceive myself into believing that others, if given the opportunity to handle my duties, could not handle them as well as I can. When 3,000 low-wage laborers can endanger the health of this city in order to seek a slight improvement in their livelihood, then the public will begin to lose faith in the Municipal Council's senior officials. I believe that senior figures in the Municipal Council's various departments should receive huge salaries if necessary, even if paid in foreign currency. However, the issue of how much salary should be paid must be carefully considered. Three years ago, an annual salary of US$7,500 for the Municipal Council's lawyer seemed too high, but today it is indeed too high.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Shanghai's Pawnshop Industry <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Pei</p>
<p>Pawnshops were originally established by local authorities, not for profit, but purely to assist the economic needs of the common people. They were intended as a borrowing place beneficial to the poor. Fearing non-repayment after borrowing, items were pledged as collateral, hence the name "pawnshop." The interest rates set were particularly low, only one or two percent per month. Later, general merchants, seeing the potential for profit, established them in large numbers for profit, gradually raising the interest rates, completely losing the original intention of assisting the economic needs of the common people.</p>
<p>The high interest rates charged by pawnshops in our country are rare in the world. In Shanghai, the typical interest rate for ordinary pawnshops is 1.8% per month, although some charge 1.6%, but that is less common. In addition to interest, there are various methods of exploitation, such as in terms of time limits: there is the "no more than five days per month" rule, meaning that if it is overdue by five days each month, interest is calculated for a full month. In addition, there are so-called handling fees, storage fees, packaging fees, and other charges. Although the interest rate is nominally 1.8% per month, it is actually 2% or more. Therefore, pawnshops today have become a disguised form of high-interest lending.</p>
<p>In general Shanghai pawnshops, the set redemption period is usually eighteen months. From the first of this month, the pawnshop industry has resolved to change the redemption period to twelve months, meaning that from the time an item is pawned, the time for redemption cannot exceed twelve months, or it will be confiscated. Although there are provisions for a grace period after the expiration date, a higher interest rate must be paid during this period. The main reason for shortening the redemption period is, of course, that pawnshops have too many pawned items, and the poor are unable to redeem them, preventing the pawnshop capital from circulating. However, drastically shortening the redemption period will further exploit the poor, as they will be unable to raise the cash within this short period and will have to watch their items expire and be confiscated. Therefore, shortening the redemption period may indeed increase the pawnshop's income significantly, but it reduces the common people's opportunity to redeem their pawned items, indirectly shortening the lifeline of the poor.</p>

<p>— A Certain Person</p>
<p>Today, June 3rd, once again brings to mind the "floating corpse case" in Tianjin. Although "floating corpses" with numerous sores all over their bodies have not yet been found in the Huangpu River in Shanghai, the suburbs of the concessions are being engulfed in poisonous flames, and countless self-destructive compatriots are unknowingly falling into hell. Although "floating corpses" have not been seen in the Huangpu River, the wilderness in the suburbs may already be filled with white bones.</p>
<p>Restricting planting and ordering the prohibition of opium had already achieved considerable success before the war. Opium prohibition bureaus were generally established in various counties and towns, requiring addicts to register and prioritizing abstinence based on age. In my hometown, the age groups are divided into ten-year periods, starting from under twenty to forty years old, and we have already reached the third period. The number of people who have quit this bad habit can be said to be over seventy or eighty percent. The poor can receive financial assistance in designated hospitals. However, after the outbreak of the war, some people secretly operated in the concessions, and even more relied on special forces in the occupied areas, openly displaying opium dens. And self-destructive compatriots have once again fallen into hell.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the prohibition regulations of the concessions are the same as the orders of the Chinese government. If there can be a practical or large-scale "drug prohibition movement," it will not be difficult to eliminate the poison. It is hoped that starting from today, like the efforts to promote the "daylight saving time" movement and the "safety" movement, we can make those demons have nowhere to escape in one fell swoop, and the crime rate in the concessions may also be reduced as a result.</p>
<p>And every citizen of the Republic of China should be strong. Those who have escaped the sea of suffering should not be tempted again, and we should also resolve to strengthen ourselves and quit immediately. The new China that is being built does not need degenerate people.</p>

<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 1 "A Quite Beautiful Lady!"</p>
<p>The female guest was about five feet one or two inches tall, which can be considered tall and graceful among the generally short women in the southeastern part of our country. She wore a short cape of light cyan fine serge on her upper body, revealing a red and white striped silk cheongsam underneath, which covered the backs of her silver leather perforated shoes. She had a melon-seed-shaped face, with cheekbones that were strikingly red. A pair of lively, dark eyes were covered by two slender artificial eyebrows—her original natural eyebrows were often destroyed by barbers, leaving no trace! The position of her nose was very appropriate, and the bridge of her nose was thin, straight, and not low, which was also an important element in her beauty. Her small mouth was originally one of the main reasons for her beauty, but because she wore too much lipstick, it made me feel a little "apprehensive." The skin on her face was certainly white and delicate to the highest degree, but I dare not believe that it was mostly due to the power of "lead powder." Therefore, it was not easy to judge whether she was eighteen or nineteen, or twenty-three or twenty-four.</p>
<p>"You—you are not Hawthorne—" she looked at me suspiciously, while raising her slender fingers with powder-pink nail polish, and brushed her permed, almost reddish-brown hair. She also wore a rather large diamond ring on her finger.</p>
<p>I replied: "Mr. Hawthorne will be back soon. Would you like to sit down for a while?" I said this somewhat reluctantly, because her kind of unnatural dignified manner—arrogance, and that impolite address, had revealed her identity or level of education.</p>
<p>She took off the cape, revealing two jade arms that had also been artificially decorated. Her clothes were very thin. Because of the tailor's exquisite skills, the cheongsam and her muscles were particularly smooth, making it seem even less able to withstand the chill of this late spring morning. But she didn't seem to feel it, which made me admire the strong cold resistance of urban women.</p>
<p>She sat on the sofa near the desk, crossed one leg over the other, and my eyes added another color. Her feet were also bare like mine, and scarlet toes were revealed in the perforations of the silver leather. Her sitting posture seemed very skilled, tilting one foot, putting a red and white interlaced leather handbag on her thigh, and glancing at me as if waiting for me to flatter her. (3)</p>
