<h3 id="c3">積極之兼善社會 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>獨善不足訓。先賢有云；「古之人，得志，遭遇其時，則布恩澤加被於民」，斯爲兼善之達者。夫孰不樂善？能兼善者蓋鮮。豈得志逢時者今乏其人？豈盡述邅而今無達者哉，竊期期以爲不然，物望儘可有爲，祗以不達，斯不事兼善一也。有此心，有其魄力，復善用其時間，則隨處皆得爲人助；雖落莫街頭，爲頒白者負戴可也；助人者利他，利社會，斯即兼善之義；或乃忽之，以爲未得志，未逢時，無餘力，無物望，輒自顧欿然，以爲無能爲焉，愛莫能助，斯不事兼善，二也。由後之說，邁迹自身而可以媿古之人矣，顧不多覯。今人有馮君炳南者，迹其作爲，志切兼善；茲以其人其事，引伸我說。</p>
<p>馮君爲其母壽，擯絕俗尚，而惟延請篤學之士，分日演講儒釋道耶回五敎道德要旨，以勵末俗，而移人心；更斥其私財，舉辦社會福利事業社，爲敎育人員，新聞從業人員，宗敎，失業自助，及健康互保會五種補助基金。是壽母之別開生面，願宏意遠者也。原人羣之禍福利害，人羣自作而自受之；人人爲我，我爲人人；助人即所以自助，立己即所以立人；此實人羣常道，亦屬老生常道。然就現實以言這，人方醉　於拜金主義，盡量擴展其個人慾求，尚有不知戚　友朋者，寗知有羣，更安知羣衆之福利；而馮君獨能注意社會爲利事業，則自有足多矣。</p>
<p>今之謀社會福利者，或國家、或公園，或慈善家，皆能同情於貧苦階層面視爲措施之對象。其事不一、其功不可沒；然大都偏於消極方面、未能兵有促進文化，提高人類德性，發揮羣已互助精神之意義。蓋在一方爲施捨，施捨以外之意義，所不計也。受施者但知濟一時之急，而於其此後能吾長此獲助，能吾不再求助而惟自助，所不顧也。甚有因此自甘墮落，不自振拔者；是則惠人適以害人，當非救濟之本旨。亦有疾苦萬狀，凍餒及於無告之妻孥，徒以深惡於救濟之面目可僧，髯憂鬱自絕者；是則從事社會福利事業者所不及知，不遑顧也。亦有不求救濟，不獲救濟，顧乃出之於營私舞弊，爲非作歹之途者；此則更爲人羣之害。救濟云云。不絕於世，然仍不絕於需要救濟，其故蓋可深長思矣。</p>
<p>謂期盛世郅治，竟無復需要救濟者，其難固無殊於期河之淸；然一反往常消極之救濟而轉謀積極之方法，則馮君之五種補助基金，堪爲社會倡導也。何也，與其謂爲救濟性質，無髯謂爲對人類精神文化之一種建設事業。蓋衡其性質，則有學校敎育，社會敎育；宗敎事業，保健事業，以及勞工失業自助，要之，無非欲自食其力，從事於此類事業者，不以其待遇之淸苦，一時之艱窘，搖動其意志，而仍能恪盡厥職，畢生從事於斯；則無論物質上因此而受惠幾何，亦必有感於此精神上之慰藉。此其影響所及，將由慰藉而更得實際之鼓勵，獲致效率之精進，此所造於社會者，固不惟受惠者其人而已。</p>
<p>雖然，社會者者，人人之社會，非任何一人之社會，即以此五種事業而論，爲社會之事業，亦非個人之事業。微論其所需之經費廣大如何，欲期獨力成事，誠如馮君所謂，非有美國大富豪卡匿奇洛克非羅一流之財富，不可。但若運用其羣之力量，則集合若干千百人之力量，亦未嘗不可以造成一個卡匿奇或一洛克非羅。人定勝天，個人事業猶然，况於羣衆之福利？故云「我們義所應爲的事，不容其有所待於別人」，馮君倡之，行見必有聞風興起者。則社會福利事業社事雖艱鉅，繼此曙光，其光明不遠乎。</p>

<h3 id="c34">美國共和黨總統候選人　威爾基氏的略歷 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>共和黨全國代表大會已在費城推定威爾基爲該黨總統候選人，他是一個身材高大不修邊幅的人。他沒有競選組織，沒有競選運動的主持人，沒有競選運動的經費用，也沒有羣衆。他是美國南方電力公司的董事長，第一國家銀行的董事。他在紐的的辦公處與垣街近在咫尺，他的住宅則在富麗的五馬路，藏書七千卷之多。</p>
<p>他生於印第安那州，他的態度和演說，帶着西中部人的風味。他是熱烈的坦白的自由主義者，他過去的事業和近來迭决演說，都足以證明。他原屬於民主黨，在一九二四年，他會以俄亥俄州代表資格，參加民主黨全國代表大會。直到一九三二年，他還曾投票選舉羅斯福，並捐助競選運動費一百五十元。</p>
<p>羅斯福當選總統之後，他就退出民主黨，並且變爲反對新政最激烈的人。共和黨中沒有一個候選人，不問在黨中的歷史是怎樣悠久，能够像他一樣把新政攻擊得體無完膚。</p>
<p>美國各界各地對於這樣一位人物，却極感興趣。三個月以來，他被人邀請去演說三千餘决，差不多像好萊塢一個名星一樣出風頭。</p>
<p>威爾基第一次被人提出爲共和黨總統候選人。是在去年十一月二十日紐的銀行公會樓上證券俱樂部中。提議人是强生將軍。俱樂部會員最初聽到這樣主張有些疑惑。一星期後，紐的泰晤士報駐華盛頓訪員克洛克也在該報的評論欄提到戚爾基及其爲總統候選人的資格。於是紐的和華盛頓兩地就開始傳述威爾基或是共和黨有力的總統候選人了。</p>
<p>恰在此時，許多地方請威爾基作公開演說，雜誌主筆也不斷邀他寫文章。「幸運雜誌」並請他發表政見。他因在該雜誌四月號，發表「我們人民」一文。該文顯然係針對新政而發，其大意如下「你們執政諸公，把工商業與人民生活分開，並對他們灌輸一種憎恨與不信任的學說。但我們人民却要說：工商業是我們日常生活的」部份，損害工商業，就是損害我們。因此，放棄憎恨的態度使我們的企業重獲自由。</p>
<p>「你們在改造旗幟之下，限制人民權利，减削各州權力，把權力置諸少數人手中，你們纂奪了我們的政權。我們人民得向你們說：我們不再需要壟斷的政府，正如我們不需要壟斷的工商業一樣。歸還我們傳統的政權，解放我們，用法律來統治我們。</p>
<p>「你們兩黨的政客！把外交內政混爲一談，而我們人民所要求的是：給我們信任的外交政策。我們反對侵略國，我們尋求國外貿易，我們承認我們的生活程度，在提高世界各國的生活程度時，纔能提高」</p>
<p>數日之後紐的一個靑年律師路脫自動地把此文寄出六百份，並擁護他爲總統候選人。三星期後，各處自動印發此項文字的，共有七萬份，流傳到四十餘州。隨後並有四個男子和兩個婦女組織一個「志願郵寄委員會」，分發威爾基的言論，並在一家旅館中，每月付房金五十元，成立一個辦事處。</p>
<p>到了五月中旬，民衆擁護威爾基的，已傳遍國內三分之二。共和黨幹部到了這時纔曉得擁護威爾基運動是自然發生的。</p>
<p>威爾基以一八九二年二月十八日生於印第安那州愛爾烏德他的父親會任律師和法官。他的母親是印第安那州第一個女律師。他的祖先是德國人。</p>
<p>他在印第安那大學中，他是一個著名的閙風潮的人。在校時曾幫助他父親勝了一件訴訟。上决歐戰時，人陸軍任上尉，曾以出席軍事法庭，替兵士辯護，出名一時。</p>
<p>大戰終止後，他到阿克隆業律師。在反三K黨一案勝訴。俄亥俄州所有重要電氣事業及鐵路訴訟多由其承辦。一九二九年，任美國南方電氣公司法律顧問。四年後當選爲該公司董事長，該公司資本一•一二八•五〇一•七七八美元，其營業範圍自密歇根州直至本錫伐尼亞州。那時他僅四十一歲。</p>
<p>一九一七年，他與威爾克小姐結婚，育有一子名斐力，現在普靈斯頓大學四年級肄業。</p>
<p>美國共和黨候選總統威爾基Wendell　Wilkie係電業巨擘，年俸七萬五千美元。他關於外交政策曾經說過，「美國人一致主張不參戰，但我們如其閉着眼掩着耳道：「我對歐洲方面的變化不感興趣，」那末我們於和平無所裨補。這次戰爭的結局對於美國實有重大影響。民治國勝，我們無所懼；但是獨裁國如果擴展勢力，更接近我們的邊境，那未我們就更不安全了。」</p>

<p>股票交易、成交信誼藥廠股五十股、價爲十四元</p>
<p>昨日衆業股市交易、大半限於週末了結與補空、成交額稍增、牧盤時濟勢較佳、因補空者活動、同時招致新多來購也、</p>
<p>倫敦二十七日（週四）電、今日速東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、銀行股再告跌落、麥加利銀行股跌八先令九便士、價爲五鎊十一先令三便士、匯豐銀行英倫註冊股跌兩鎊、價爲五十三鎊、又香港註册股跌五鎊、價爲五十五鎊、其餘不動、</p>
<p>倫敦二十七日（週四）電、今日中國外債掛牌行市、仍告平穩、上下檔各債券、概無變動、</p>
<h3 id="c40">糧食　一週之中　麵粉連漲三次　每包漲起一元四角 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>昨日現粉又告漲、二號粉廠盤、自本週初漲起半元後、週三又漲四角、昨日（週五）再漲半元、已喊爲十五元二角之價、一星期中每包漲達一元四角之巨、各廠雖以新麥成本關係、似乎漲之太速、致一般平民不勝負担、聞當局對此頗爲關懷、昨有集議商討平價辦法、廠盤旣已連加三次、當可儘量供應、故昨日兩廠批出續有一萬四五千包、而客帮與囤戶、一概停售、故回籠貨均在十六元以上、尤爲一般行囤所垂注云、</p>
<p>新麥來源、逐見湧旺、但祇日商方面、領到所謂搬運許可證、華商尚屬未妥、故日廠絡繹收辦、每日的有數千包至一萬包、價在二十三元至二十四元之間、因品質關係參差不一、華廠處此環境、亦祇有放價吸收、聞福阜兩廠昨辦京滬車船麥的計四五千包、售價亦稍軒輊、</p>
<h3 id="c41">午後米價　又見不騰 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>米市自前朝再度回軟後、昨晨初開、一般作客尚冀市面步低、形勢淸淡異常、賣方見南洋風雲未平、猶無輕脫之意、於是在相持之下、市面遂呈平庸之局、如此遷延許久、直至本街店胃認爲市無小面、突出暢辦、浮囤散戶從中活動、喊聲遂起、各色洋米價卽步步上升、結果、收盤一號陳西貢又至六十三元六十二元半、二號六十一元、六十元零五角、一號暹羅六十二元六角、火絞六十二元、小絞六十元零四角、不過砶米及紅米、素以內地幫爲大宗去路、茲旣停頓、又且鄉莊亦懈、遂現平疲之態、無甚頡頑、計東京砶尖高自五十七元、决至五十六元、海防紅米五十七八元、獨米菉與混合碎更屬衰頹、米菉僅售五十二元、五十一元半、混合碎除特貨冲米菉爲五十元外、較决者自四十九元半至四十八元半、惟至下午因謠傳日軍圖越日亟、且有波及香港之說、行囤方面趁機抬價、而抵空與新囤及搶風又復活躍、各檔洋米乃至一律向上、二號西貢上午最低小至六十元零二三角者、晚收大至六十二元、小絞大至六十一元二角、暹羅二號至六十一元六角、不獨比上午低價相差一二元、卽與前晚亦較大近元也、回籠則二號　米十八裝六十七元半至六十八元、廿六裝六十六元三角、又現西買二號七十五元半、共計二百廿五噸、現米成交的九千包、因午市後卽有內地鄉莊木客及行囤吸收云、</p>
<p>粳糯國米、昨到轉旺其的二千餘包、其中以粳貨居多、傳聞塲外粳米暗盤、因之疲軟異常、成交寥寥、售價續貶近尤、常幫特淸粳七十一二元、蘇崑常州白粳七十元、决至宿貨六十八元半、靑泗薄稻大都未能做開、計開者高自七十一元、决至宿熱者六十八元半、南港早稻鮮特六十八元半、次六十七元半、糯米到貨旣稀、而又以價盤低廉、是雖銷塲未堪稱爽、貨主則售意頗堅、市面遂呈平定之局、與前相仿、金溧特別元六十元、五十九元半、常丹白元五十七八元、江北貨五十六元左右云云、</p>
<h3 id="c42">油餅　荳餅大漲小回　天雨實銷反懈　囤戶亟謀脫手 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>豆餅市况、自市以來、未遭挫折、其冉冉上升之力、完全由投機者一手造成、但際此旺銷之時、本操良好局面、詎得雨後實銷反呈懈淡、致昨市一部份浮囤見勢不佳、恐難支持、故亟謀晚手、市面立軟角譜、總之究屬時値非常、購買力不健、昨統祇做開大有餘廠四牌餅三千片、現貨價爲十三元五角、訂七月上半月分爲十三元五角半、甡記餅四千片、現貨價爲十三元至十二元九角、七月上爲十三元一角至零五分、元隆餅一車、價爲十二元八角半、靑中餅五百片、價爲十二元三角云、</p>

<p>紗市仍　平疲、趨勢始跌後回、此因實際銷塲凋疲、兼之六月底結賬時期已屆一般浮多無力收貨、祇得忍痛斬結、所以市盤依然鬆懈、二十支雙馬低峰曾達八百元、旋以獲利補空、回至八百六十元、前途仍在現銷上着想也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、因外匯情形硬化、塲中買戶仍乏與奮性、加之廠家亦來收貨、散多傾向吐出、檯面仍鬆、二十支雙馬爲八百四十元、直跌至八百元、嗣以多頭復來塌便宜貨、稍爲幣昂一步、但客幫銷路仍少生色、收盤價爲八百五十元、查牛日間成交統計二千七百五十五包、行情二十支雙馬跌三十五元、今日有棉紗一百三十五件運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>

<p>現棉交易依然沉悶、蓋以紗銷西南不暢、所以廠家納胃閉塞、生意之成交、猶似鳳毛麟角也、但執貨者需要現款之用、售價竟願特別廉宜、然吃客嘗試者、仍未踴躍也、</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐的棉市、市况雖小、然殊形堅定、一部份之補空、現貨交易尚稱活躍、結果收盤價格較之今日略漲五六磅音、印度棉市、盛傳政府尤受保兵險、故市况活躍、昨日連同預測漲六七羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來華方廠商異常靜寂、然日方廠商以紗銷殊佳、故對於原棉之採購、較爲活躍、但付款期則稍爲延長耳、</p>

<p>國布昨以月底　款關係、散額廉貨續有塞出、售盤趨勢仍軟、良以囤戶意興淡薄、貨價尚賴實銷及執貨者之堅持、而獲支撑也、白貨粗細布及漂染布每疋續跌二角半至五角、本街批發號進粗布·坯布·斜紋·色布·漂布·一萬五六千疋、染廠進坯布近萬疋、多數運銷蘇浙皖各游擊區、山東帮辦色布色斜一百餘件、浙東溫甬帮辦細布色布粗布二百餘件、國外新加坡暹邏辦色布漂布二千餘疋、</p>
<p>東布昨市先跌後漲、形勢轉堅、十二磅龍頭細布晨開跌至廿七元八角、四君子嗶嘰八角二分半、嗣因同業補空、本街批發及染廠亦來採辦、市氣頓緊、下午龍頭細布回升至三十元、嗶嘰八角八分、</p>
<h3 id="c46">糖市　刁靑見新高價 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>昨洋糖市依然下游、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白外棧爲六十七元五角至七角、小三角、轉口貨七月二日打棧單者五十四元、跌一元、太古車白B嘜七十八元半、亦降一元、荷赤仍五十九元四角、國糖成交雖少、堅穩之態、初未稍减、而刁靑且見新高價、幾與粗白並駕、誠歷來所未見焉、計白色高刁靑五十包、六十五元半、又一百五十包、六十五元、升元半至一元、油次者一百包、仍六十三元半、又昨日由海口來糖一百三十五包、</p>

<p>靑笋干因產區水道已通、來源仍由竹排順流至杭、爲數甚湧、計到申者前後已達二千餘件、故市勢立軟、昨高肥挺售二元八角、小二角、普通二元半、高禿挺二元四角、降度相同、普通二元一角、早元尚未成交、前途有續鬆之象、</p>

<p>鴻基白煤屑、連日有輪運到、市上已不虞缺乏、各煤球廠亦有兩三個月原料存儲、人心穩定、價亦明定暗鬆、某行折盤、雖尚擯持一百四十元老盤、但屯戶手貨、削低七八元行情、亦有塞出、故本街門莊、亦一律减小、</p>

<p>英駐華大使寇爾爵士、此次由渝來滬、原擬早日北上、於北戴河作這暑之計、徒以時局緊張、重要政務、尚有亟待處理者、乃遲遲其行、買棹無期矣、茲悉大使定今日廣播演講、不特本埠英僑聞訊欣然、予以重視、卽無數中華友人、亦以爵士抵滬以來、已有多日、尚未能於公衆塲所瞻仰丰采、今日旣在空中廣播、自可飽聆名言讜論、藉資他山之助、</p>
<p>英大使寇爾爵士近影</p>

<p>歐戰初起　大使講詞</p>
<p>去秋歐戰初起、大使曾在滬上一度公開對英僑演講、詞意警闢、語句生動、綜其大意、尚有得以重述者、當時滬上英僑、因聞祖國對德宣戰、爲保衛社稷、奮起請纓、執干戈以衛國家、大使對其同胞之一片赤忱、極爲感動、惟以間關萬里、交通阻隔、英僑在滬、均有正常職業、若能抓住本位、卽是報國之途、初不必騁馳疆塲也、故其演講中曾有一段、大意爲余於上决大戰時、年事較輕、方供職於外交界中、一聞祖國有難、亦如諸君之熱血沸騰、卽欲赴前綫參戰、但余之長官、未能徇從余意、當時殊覺憤懑、邇者流光迅速、忽忽已二十載、當時情形、歷歷猶在目前、而余已馬齒徒增、廻念往事、殊覺余長官所言爲極是、願諸君亦卽努力於本位事業、一待政府有命、立卽應召、共赴國難云云、語重心長、想滬上英僑當能善體其大使之意也、</p>
<p>葡僑喚起　同胞助英</p>

<p>目的所在</p>
<p>日憲兵隊長三浦少將爰於上星期五日致牒法公董局當局、說明日方取締重慶恐怖份子之願望、內包括移交捕獲之反日份子予日方暨法日當局會同搜查及檢問、至本星期四日、法公董局表示贊同日方建議、而尤法日警務當局互相合作、昨日乃以書面通知日軍事當局、</p>

<p>做兒女的，都應該盡孝道，這是亘古以來的天經地義，孝是怎麼樣的一件事呢？古今來的聖賢明哲，對於孝的道理，已經發揮盡致了，而且力行孝道的人，在我國更史不絕書。不過人倫道德的觀念，是隨着時代而進化的，所以鄙人對於孝道的見解，有一點補充。做兒女的，因爲要報答父母劬勞養育之恩，所以盡孝，這是歷古以來的說法，也是萬世不磨的一個道理，這是從兒女自己身上着想的。如果我們再從父母方面着想，則做父母的，個個多願意他們的兒女能盡孝道。父母養大一個兒女成人，是費了無限心血精神的，甚至往往有爲了兒女而犧牲了自己生命的，一部分犧牲了自己的健康，犧牲了自己的幸福，比一個偉大的藝術家成就一件最偉大的藝術品所費的精神心力更多，更苦，更吃力。這樣養成的兒女，而不能盡孝，則何貴乎生育兒女。一個藝術家所以專心致志於他的作品，目的就是要他的作品成功。父母對於兒女的期望的心理，也是如此，不過更懇切罷了。生兒育女，撫養成人，是一件最複雜，最不容易，最苦痛，最要耐性，最要小心負責的事。尤其是做母親的，在懷孕和生育時間的痛苦，所以不辭痛苦而生育兒女者，爲的就是有一個期望在後頭。如果兒女不盡孝，則父母的這種期望，成爲空虛，於是做父母的都會感覺得所吃的痛苦，爲不值得，而且無意義，不特對於自己不值得，無意義，就是對於社會，對於人類，也是不值得，也是無意義，於是人人都想避免痛苦，及一切負擔，而不生育兒女。近年有人提倡節育，一部分的理由，是爲經濟環境，一部分的理由，是爲母體的健康，而事實上則有許多本來應該做母親的因爲要逃避生育的苦痛和撿養的麻煩而節育。這種風氣，美國最盛。據統計者說，美國的節育增加率，若長此以往，則六十年後恐怕就不會再有生育。如果全人類都有這樣的傾向，則整個人類，不難趨於滅絕。（其中有一兩個國家却正在竭力提倡生育，像德國和意大利，姑勿論其目的如何，在這一點上，總不失爲知機的。）他們知道在世界上生存，以人力爲第一，所以他們極力獎勵生育，我國的孟子也說過，「不孝有三，無後爲大，一我國人數千年來都尊重這個說法，所以直至今日，我國民族蕃昌。人口之多，冠於各國，可見得古昔聖賢究竟是先知先覺。由此說來，則兒女盡孝，做父母的，才樂於生育兒女，人類才不至於滅絕，若不提倡孝道，則雖有兒女，亦只足以爲害於社會。有人或者會問，禽獸不知孝何以禽獸却能維持其嗣續；而不至於滅絕呢？這就因爲禽獸有性慾的本能，而沒有節育的知識。人雖有性慾的本能，但是同時有節育的智識，因此禽獸不至於把自已的種族滅絕，而人類若不提倡孝道，則種族轉有滅絕之虞，所以孝道不止關係自己的良知良能，簡直是關係全民族全人類的存亡問題，不止是倫常道德上的問題，簡直是很現實的社會大問題，國家大問題，民族大問題，全人類的大問題。</p>

<p>日本各舖戶人家，均喜用煤油以燭夜，故市上煤油行銷甚巨；惟地方官吏則常慮此油容易失慎，前經出諭居民，凡各賣戶，如有煤油十箱者，以二箱門市出售，以八箱貯藏官處，售完後，再到官處領取，以防不虞。此諭出後，未免買賣兩難，故遵諭者殊鮮。今日人新得一法，用藥水合油點之，不但不能着火，且光更勝於煤油，因之而改用者甚多云。</p>

<p>— 野孩子的朋友</p>
<p>讀了姚景行先生的救救野孩子，就不揣淺陋的報告一些關於救助野孩的小經騐。十幾年來看到了街路上求乞的男女老幼，沒有一次不興起無限的傷感。常常和許多朋友討論如何積極救濟這沿門托鉢的一羣。但談的時間多，做的機會無，戰事爆發後，接近了一個保育兒童的新集團，乃得建議救濟乞童。雖然沒有整個解決本市乞討問題，而對於野孩子（丐童及拾垃圾者）開闢了一條小小的路，可以引導他們到達人生康樂的園地。</p>
<p>目前在這條路上前進的有七十多個小朋友。他們中間有的已經討過二三年飯；有的二三個月；有的沒有討過飯，而家庭遭到悲痛的毀減。我們為他們組織了一個家庭，學校，工場，三位一體的場所。</p>
<p>我們告訴他們人生是寶貴的，不應該自暴自棄去度着流浪的卑污的生活。現在這七十多個小朋友半天讀書，半天學手藝，臉是長得相當的豐滿，胸也挺得高高的。他們會看書，寫字，唱歌，畫圖，弈棋，打乒乓，燒飯，洗衣，拖地板，擦玻璃窗，縫衣，製鞋。他們和有錢人家的小孩並肩站着，也不會自覺卑污，他們是忘記了過去悽慘的一幕幕。年齡較小的，一天到晚跳跳跑跑，有時依依在教師身伴，猶如體味著慈母的甜意。</p>
<p>然而事情往往不能像理想那樣的美滿，偶然也會有幾個惡習太深，不知自愛的兒童，不甘過着團體的有規律的生活，寗可遊蕩在街頭巷尾。我們勸道無效時，爲了保持其餘兒童的生活的安寗，祗得由他們去再度嘗試流浪的滋味，直到他們覺悟回來，我們就同目見浪子回頭一樣的興奮。有幾個經過了幾次的逃走，回來時就特別安心工讀。</p>
<p>看到他們微笑着的面龐，注視在書本上，或手裏的工作時，我們心底深處同時洋溢起快慰的微渦。</p>
<p>我們期待着一切善意的指導和援助。我們的地點是在白利南路三十七號A·</p>

<h3 id="c85">歷史勝跡貢比埃臬 <a href="#c85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— 潔泉</p>
<p>此次德法兩國，在貢比埃臬森林中簽訂和約以後，該處將成為歷史上永不磨滅的名勝地方了。臬比埃臬這名詞，並非專指森林而言，在森林附近，還有一個貢比埃臬城，也是一座古色古香的城市。</p>
<p>貢比埃臬城位於愛納河與瓦茲河合流點的下游。當地居民約有一萬五千人，大多以製造船舶，編織綫索，製造水管等爲業。該處商業頗爲發達，尤以麻布，木靴，木材，煤炭，以及農產物等爲交易大宗。那處所製造的帽子和農產物，如小粉，及大麥等，也很著名。</p>
<p>城中的古跡甚多。旅客遊行其地，可以看見許多古代城堡的遺跡。其中有十二世紀時所建的高塔一座，現在已經大半頃坍。這座危塔，　立在瓦茲河岸旁，當地居民，都稱之爲「聖女貞德塔」。此外尚有聖安東尼教堂一所，半爲十二世紀及半爲十六世紀的建築物。附近的聖傑克教堂，亦係十二世紀的古物。在這所教堂中間，藏有珍貴的古鶩極多。貢比埃臬市中心，還有著名雕刻家勒羅氏所　的聖女貞德紀念像。城中也有大學一所。貢城自古以來，即是政治家以及主教等會議之處。聖女貞德曾於一四三〇年五月十四日，在此處被擒。貢比埃臬的王宮，也係名勝的所在，法王路易十六世與瑪麗安東尼以及拿破崙一世與奧國的瑪麗路易士，均在此王宮中舉行婚禮。上述許多古跡，經過這次兵災以後，不知還能完好無損否？</p>
<p>貢比埃臬森林，在貢比埃臬城南，位於瓦茲河，愛納河，及巴黎城之間。森林面積占一百四十平方公里強，週圍約九十四公里。林中古跡甚多，即使前的遺跡，亦有四十餘處之多。古代法郎族人的帝王，常往林中馳騁狩獵。上次歐戰結束之時，法德兩國代表會在林中的一輛餐車中間簽訂和約，這次德國戰勝以後，希特勒爲雪恥起見，所以亦迫令法國人在舊地同一餐車上簽訂和約，可是訂約以後，却把那輛陳舊的破車，運回柏林珍藏起來，以作紀念，然而他却沒有把貢比埃臬森林，也搬到柏林去！</p>
<h3 id="c86">畢業誓詞 <a href="#c86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— 李希之</p>
<p>我得受大學教育，是社會的特殊恩賜。我得到畢業文憑，除了表示我曾盡力研讀以外，並無特殊的功勳。我要謙恭，因為我沒有驕傲的理由。</p>
<p>我接受了社會的恩賜，也要把那恩賜，全部歸還給社會。這是我的義務，也是我的責任。社會上的兄弟姊妹，多數沒有接受大學教育的福氣，我要同情他們，幫助他們，扶持他們。</p>
<p>今天我脫離學校生活，可是我並不脫離學習的生活。我要在生活中學習，也要在學習中生活。我要追求世界上的光明，我要發揚宇宙間的真理。我決不辜負我所受的教育。</p>
<p>我所受的教育，不過是踏入社會去做人的一個準備階段。在做人之餘，我決不忘記正在危難中的國家，因為沒有國家，就沒有我。我要盡量利用我所舉行得，去貢獻給我的祖國，我要使祖國向復興的途中邁進，因為我要使這個世界，成為一個更美好的世界。</p>

<p>金梅繼續道：「老毛向這室中望了一望，便主張先打電話通報陸經理。李老爺也贊成的。就由我打電話到他的公館裏去。陸經理還沒有回家。我就說不如再通知王小姐的好朋友姜安娜小姐。不料伊也不在快樂舞場裏。我們的意思，想找一個可以作主的人來，再想辦法。因為李老爺難得來的，像個客人。他也不很熟悉王小姐的情形，故而不肯出什麽主張。後來我們商量了一下，就差老毛出去找陸經理跟姜小姐，直到天已亮了，老毛方才陪了姜小姐到這裏來。接着陸經理也從揚子旅社完了雀局回家，知道了這個消息，就先打電話到這裏來詢問。我將王小姐被槍殺的事告訴了他，他說由他去報告警署。但他自己至今還不曾來過。」金梅說完了又把目光瞧瞧伊的已死的主人，旋又注視着那條白地藍花的厚地毯，似等待其他的問句。</p>
<p>霍桑又問道：「姜小姐到了這裏做過什麽事？」</p>
<p>「伊一瞧見王小姐那個模樣，眼眶裏包滿了眼淚，分明很悲傷。伊向我們問明了經過的情形，便說這件事很蹊蹺，一定要查個明白。」</p>
<p>「唉，伊說很蹊蹺？伊可有什麽表示？」</p>
<p>金梅的眼角仿佛向霍桑和金壽瞅了一瞅。伊躊躇了一下，方才側過了頭回答·</p>
<p>「沒有，伊祗說要去請一個姓霍的偵探來查究這一件事……。」</p>
<p>倪金壽忽又停了鉛筆，插嘴道：「這一位就是霍桑先生，全國聞名的大偵……」</p>

<p>— 李紹忠</p>
<p>一個人的才力和見識，究竟有限。所以我們有句俗諺說是：「三個臭皮匠，勝過一個諸葛亮。」</p>
<p>小自個人的行動，大至國家的政治措施，都需要正確的，合理的建設性的批評－或由良久的忠告，或為輿論的意見－來督促，來指正，使不善的，和不完美的地方，能加以改良革新，成為善的，和完美的。由此，我們可以說，「批評」「進步」的主要動力之一</p>
<p>但是，時下有一般所謂「批評」的看家本領，就在「武斷一切，抹煞倫理。」</p>
<p>對於一些妄用「X不等於Y，即等於Z」的公式的「批評家」們，我們是祗得「夫複何言」的。我們　然不是說，一定要精讀倫理舉「三白遍」，然後才可下筆寫「批評」。不過要是死抱著「此物非馬即為狗」的「新邏輯」，揚揚得意地下筆千言，論是議非，我們真不免要替世界上許多「白首窮經」的倫理學者們捏一把冷汗。</p>
<p>「批評」是「進步」的動力之一，但，我們需要的批評態度</p>
<p>第一，冷靜的頭腦，以摹理爲對象，不意氣用事，更不當「假公爲私」。</p>
<p>第二，不強辦，不曲解，不背「邏輯」。</p>
<p>第三，對於批判的對象，自己須下一番研究的工夫。把問題認識與了解清楚之後再提筆來發揮意見。不要「盲人騎瞎馬」般地亂撞一番。至於一些自己本身對一個問題還在「一知半解」之中，就大發議論的朋友，人家當然是「不敢領教」的了。</p>

<p>— 沛然</p>
<p>金星影業公司宣告成立了。該公司在報間所刊的成立廣告，有說到他們的製片方針的，說是：「出品取材，必期審慎；攝製技術，務求精進。」這態度很好，值得關心中國電影的人們興奮。</p>
<p>上海成為孤島以後，文化界始終站在自己的崗位上，切實努力，不會辜負社會的期望；比較起來，如果我們不願護短，那麼電影界不能不說是最落後的一環。照最近的情形說來，不但跟文化界脫節，而且跟環境完全妥協了。</p>
<p>金星公司在這時候成立，而且態度又是那麼誠懇切實，是值得我們欣喜的事。在此，筆者願以一電影愛好者的資格，向它寄予若干的期望：</p>
<p>第一，上海的環境困難，我們大家知道；我們固然不希望有慷慨激昂之作；卻也決不願意聽靡靡之音。電影作品，最低限度，應當不和現實游離，鼓勵觀眾精神向上，這是關於內容方面</p>
<p>第二，現在正是物力維艱的時代，出品固然要儘可能的快，物力固然要儘可能的節省，但以不損害作品本身為度。粗製濫造，一日編一劇，十日攝一片，是要不得的。製作態度應當嚴肅，這是關於形式方面。</p>
<p>自然，這也期望於整個電影界，但對於新生的金星，我們的期望尤其迫切！聽說周劍雲君是金星主要負責人之一，以周君過去奮鬥的歷史，當可以保證我們期望的兌現吧。</p>
<p>當金星誕生之初，謹祝它進步和努力，前途無量！</p>

<p>但是，她的身體到底並未完全復原，因此數天演後，足部忽然發腫，事實上告訴她除了靜靜修養，暫時再也不可演劇，於是在昨天起，劇中娜如改由林娜演出，大約最近期內，在她祗有踏着病足作為觀劇者的了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Soviet-Romanian Agreement Established; Romania Cedes Northeastern Territory; Red Army Enters Romanian Ceded Area; Rumors of Hungarian Territorial Demands; Ceded Area Includes Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Moscow, The Soviet government announced this afternoon in its official gazette that the Soviet Union and Romania have reached an agreement stipulating that Romania cede Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union. A Soviet-Romanian commission has also been established to handle the transfer of territory, with General Kotikov and General Potemkin as the Soviet representatives. It is reported that Soviet troops are scheduled to enter the cities of Tighina, Chișinău, and Cetatea Albă at 2:00 PM today. (Haitong News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>Moscow, The government announced today that as the Red Army entered Romanian territory and began occupying Cernăuți, Cetatea Albă, and Chișinău, Romania has agreed to the Soviet demand to cede Bessarabia and the northern region of Bukovina to the Soviet Union. Romania has also expressed its consent to the Soviet military's occupation of Cernăuți, Chișinău, and Cetatea Albă, and will also transfer railways and other industries within these areas to the Soviet Union. (United Press, 28th)</p>
<p>Moscow, The Soviet government's official gazette this afternoon announced the acceptance of the territories of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina from Romania, stating that on June 26th, the Soviet government delivered an ultimatum to the Romanian ambassador to the Soviet Union, Davidescu, demanding that Romania immediately cede Bessarabia and northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union. On June 27th, the Romanian government replied to the Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, expressing its willingness to discuss the territorial issue. Because Molotov felt that the Romanian response did not guarantee the cession of territory, he questioned Davidescu whether the Romanian government was prepared to accept the Soviet demands. Davidescu replied that the Romanian government agreed to the Soviet proposal. The Soviet Union then sent a second note on the 27th, demanding that Romania begin withdrawing within four days, starting from 12:00 noon (local time) on the 28th, and that the Soviet Union immediately occupy the cities of Cetatea Albă, Cernăuți, and Chișinău. Today, Soviet troops began advancing towards the aforementioned three cities at 2:00 PM on the 28th.

<p>Bucharest, According to well-informed sources here, the Soviet Union's ultimatum to Romania did not demand the right to military ports or control of any seaports. The ultimatum's demands were limited to the return of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina. Bessarabia has an area of 44,424 square kilometers and, according to statistics from July 1, 1938, a population of 3,147,000. According to official statistics from 1930, there were 1,000,000 Ukrainians and Russians, but Ukrainians claim there were 1,500,000. The rest were 80,000 Germans, tens of thousands of Jews, and various other minorities. Romania annexed Bessarabia in 1918, which the Soviet Union has never recognized. Other European powers only recognized it after many years. Northern Bukovina, originally Austrian territory, was ceded to Romania by the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. It has an area of 10,444 square kilometers and, according to statistics from 1938, a population of 917,000, of which Ukrainians account for half and Jews account for 10 to 15 percent. (Haitong News Agency, 28th)</p>

(Haitong News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>Bucharest, On Wednesday afternoon, the Soviet Union issued an ultimatum to Bucharest. Romania has proposed diplomatic negotiations, but the Soviet Union has refused to respond.

<h3 id="e3">Active Social Benefit for All <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Self-cultivation alone is not enough. A wise man once said, "In ancient times, those who achieved their ambitions, encountering the right time, would spread grace and benefit to the people," these were the masters of the benefit for all. Who does not enjoy doing good? But few can benefit all. Are there no people today who achieve their ambitions and encounter the right time? Are all those who encounter difficulties today without those who succeed? I earnestly believe this is not the case. Great achievements are possible, but they remain unfulfilled simply because the commitment to benefitting all is lacking. If one has this aspiration, the courage, and uses time wisely, one can help others everywhere. Even when down on one's luck, one can carry burdens for the elderly. Helping others benefits them and benefits society, which is the essence of benefitting all. Some may overlook this, thinking they have not achieved their ambitions, have not encountered the right time, have no resources, no influence, and feel inadequate, unable to help. This is a second failure to commit to benefitting all. Following this line of reasoning, one can find oneself falling short of the ancients, a situation unfortunately too common. Today, there is Mr. Feng Bingnan, whose actions reveal a strong commitment to benefitting all. I will use his example to expand on my argument.</p>
<p>Mr. Feng celebrated his mother's birthday by rejecting vulgar customs, instead inviting learned scholars to lecture on the essential moral principles of Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, and Islam to inspire and transform people. He also used his private wealth to establish a social welfare organization that provides five types of assistance funds for educators, journalists, religious figures, the unemployed, and mutual health insurance. This is a novel way to celebrate a mother's birthday, showing a grand vision and far-reaching intentions. Human misfortune and happiness are self-created and self-experienced. Everyone is for me, and I am for everyone. Helping others is helping oneself, and establishing oneself is establishing others. This is the constant way of humanity, an often-repeated principle. But in reality, people are intoxicated with materialism, expanding their personal desires to the fullest, and some do not even care about relatives and friends, let alone the community or the welfare of the masses. Mr. Feng's unique focus on social welfare is truly commendable.</p>
<p>Those who seek social welfare today, whether states, public institutions, or philanthropists, all sympathize with the poor and treat them as objects of their measures. Their actions vary, and their contributions are undeniable, but they mostly focus on the passive aspects, failing to promote culture, enhance human virtue, and foster a spirit of mutual assistance. They primarily focus on charity, not considering the broader implications. Recipients only know to address their immediate needs, not considering whether they can continue to receive assistance, or how to become self-reliant and no longer seek help. Some even become complacent and fail to improve themselves, thus harming them instead of helping, which is not the purpose of relief. Others suffer immensely, their families enduring cold and hunger, but they deeply resent the condescending nature of relief, succumbing to despair and suicide. Social welfare providers are often unaware of this, unable to address it. Others, not seeking or receiving relief, resort to corruption, and wrongdoings, further harming the community. Relief efforts are ceaseless, yet the need for relief persists. The reason for this deserves deep reflection.</p>
<p>To hope for an era of prosperity and perfect governance where no one needs relief might be as difficult as hoping for the Yellow River to run clear. But instead of the usual passive relief, seeking active solutions, Mr. Feng's five assistance funds can serve as a social model. Why? Rather than seeing it as a relief effort, it should be viewed as a contribution to the spiritual and cultural development of humanity. Judging by its nature, it includes school education, social education, religious endeavors, healthcare services, and assistance to the unemployed, all aiming to enable individuals to support themselves. Those who engage in these endeavors do not let low pay or temporary hardship shake their resolve but continue to fulfill their duties and dedicate their lives to these causes. Regardless of the material benefits they receive, they will feel a sense of spiritual comfort. This influence will lead to practical encouragement, resulting in improved efficiency, and benefiting society far beyond the individual recipients.</p>
<p>However, society is the society of everyone, not the society of any one person. Even with these five types of endeavors, as projects of society, they are not just individual undertakings. Not to mention the vast amount of funding required, to expect to accomplish such a task single-handedly, as Mr. Feng himself said, one would need the wealth of American tycoons like Carnegie or Rockefeller. But if the power of the community is harnessed, the collective strength of hundreds or thousands of people can create a Carnegie or a Rockefeller. Human determination overcomes nature. This is true for individual projects, let alone the welfare of the masses. Therefore, it is said, "What we are obligated to do should not depend on others." Mr. Feng has initiated this, and we will see others following suit. Although social welfare organizations are challenging, with this initial glimmer of hope, true progress cannot be far off.</p>

<h3 id="e13">The First Graduating Class of the Sichuan Provincial Training Corps; President Chiang's Address; Governance Values Naming and Verifying Actualities; Cannot Leave the Masses; Hereafter, One Should Use the Spirit of Warfare to Engage in Local Autonomy Construction <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Chengdu: The first graduating class of the Sichuan Provincial Training Corps held a graduation ceremony on the 28th. In President Chiang's address, he stated that at the beginning of the Corps' establishment, a speech was given, explaining that the purpose of the Corps was to create a model of people's models, a cadre of cadres, and listing five essential points on how to achieve the above tasks. Last month, during the Weekly Memorial to the Premier, there was a more detailed speech, which particularly emphasized the implementation of orders, putting public interests before private interests, paying attention to methods of doing things, earnestly implementing, directing, supervising, assessing, rewarding, and punishing, etc., which are necessary cultivations for modern civil servants. Now that graduation has arrived, what I want to repeatedly emphasize to you is to deeply understand each of the above instructions, to see them in practice, and to achieve complete success. Since the Premier personally initiated and began to implement local autonomy, the Party has not had concrete implementation due to various environmental factors, and the work of nation-building has long been delayed. The foundation of internal affairs is not strong, which has led to foreign insults and the current dangerous situation. To trace the root of the problem, it can be summarized in one sentence: local autonomy cannot be implemented. The foundation of governance lies in people. In the past, the lack of people's qualifications and the lack of attention to cadre issues were the biggest among all the bad causes. Now that the outlines of county-level organizations have been promulgated, and the implementation of the Sichuan provincial and county system has been underway for several months, the laws are ready and the orders are carried out. What is urgent is the strengthening of cadres at all grassroots levels. Now, with the qualifications of the first batch of trained cadres, you are returning to your original positions to shoulder this arduous task. Personnel, time, place, and other conditions are all properly configured, and you must start anew with the spirit of striving for progress by leaps and bounds. Several meanings are given to encourage you to govern: First, the term local autonomy, literally, should focus on the self-character of autonomy. Therefore, everything should be sought from oneself, and the distance between name and reality, the rise and fall of social welfare, should be used as a measure. If things don't go well, reflect on oneself. This kind of self-reflection can promote individuals and even society to progress continuously. You are not only basic cadres for local administration, but also responsible for training teachers for cadres at all levels. How to make yourself healthy in order to influence the majority of students, subordinates, and the masses is not only related to the success or failure of a political system reform, but also a major issue for the survival of our nation in the future. The importance of this meaning should be deeply alerted by you. Second, the key to governance is to value naming and verifying actualities. The name is mentioned, and the reality is enough to match it. In this way, one is not false to oneself and does not deceive others. The deep disease and major drawbacks in politics throughout history lie in flaunting beautiful names, but there is no actual action. Even if the laws and creations are extremely complete, they are like oranges south of the Huai River, their quality is no longer the same. Repeated mistakes can serve as a warning. The various contents stipulated in the new county system require that they be done step by step and practically, one by one. It is necessary to be both fast and accurate. The desire for quick success and instant benefits should not be strong, and the disease of exaggeration and decoration should be eradicated at the root. Nation-building is not different from army-building, and administration is the same as warfare. Seeking truth from facts, being meticulous and comprehensive, being stable and steady, and seizing opportunities are iron rules for seeking political efficiency, although they are commonly used terms in military affairs. The consistent and interconnected principles must be thoroughly understood. Third, the purpose of politics is to seek the welfare of all the people. Without the people, there is no politics to speak of, especially with the meaning of autonomy being vastly different. Therefore, our grassroots personnel in local autonomy, on the one hand, should have a high opinion of themselves in terms of personality, resolutely taking on the responsibility of being wise and aware, and on the other hand, must be consistent with the people's lives and have the same spirit. In this way, they can gain the love and obedience of the masses. If there is a slight notion of a special class, it will lead to increasing isolation from the masses and eventually be abandoned. It is not to serve people, but to be served by people. All civil servants today should have this belief. The people can be made to follow, but they must also be made to know. In terms of the meaning of the times, this must be explained in this way. Therefore, the object of work is the masses, not superiors, and the power of public opinion is greater than the state's rewards and punishments. As long as you take your sincere and compassionate heart, think about the welfare of the society and the people in everything, and do not worry too much about difficulties and obstacles, persevere and strive for success, right and wrong will be announced in the hearts of the people, and merits and demerits cannot be diminished. In the past, Duke Du Zheng advocated sincerity and honesty to the world, and was able to transform the movement and achieve success. Today, the disease of society is exactly the same, and only this medicine can save it. What I showed earlier, putting public interests before private interests, is a footnote to the word sincerity, and the practical, quick, and hard work that I have advocated for more than ten years is a concrete explanation of the word honesty. Fourth, in my opening speech at the first session of the Party and Government Training Class of the Central Training Corps, I suggested that local autonomy be the starting point for the practice of ism, that improving the people's livelihood and developing the national economy be the central task for promoting local autonomy, and that the New Life Movement, the National Spiritual Mobilization, and the National Economic Construction Movement be the ways to practice them. With the center established and the paths ready, following the path will naturally lead to success every day. However, strengthening the body is more important than cultivating the foundation, and eliminating evils is more urgent than promoting benefits. At present, the province's prohibition of smoking, clearing the countryside, and suppressing bandits have achieved considerable results. It is hoped that we can take a further step to achieve a truly clean and clear environment, so that all construction can be established on a solid foundation. The road ahead is long, and the light can be connected. Today's trip will be judged by you. The international situation is changing more rapidly, and the environment of the war of resistance is becoming more difficult. History tells us that without the spirit of fighting with life and death, it is impossible to break through the encirclement and obtain the guarantee of national survival. I deeply hope that on this occasion of leaving the Corps, you will all be aware that you are soldiers with live ammunition walking onto the battlefield, and that in the future, you should use the spirit of warfare everywhere to engage in the construction of local autonomy, without hesitation, without懈怠, and thoroughly. Your merits are no less than those of the soldiers on the front lines of the charge. (Telegraph, 28th)</p>

<p>Chongqing: The Chinese Air Force is now actively assisting the Chinese army in taking the counter-offensive in the Yichang area, bombing the Japanese army's concentration points every day. Today, several Chinese planes bombed the Japanese army in Yichang. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to Chinese military sources, the fighting near Yichang is intensifying. The Chinese army is now launching a large encirclement offensive on Yichang in three directions. The Yaque Ridge, northeast of Yichang, has been recovered by the Chinese army. The Japanese army has suffered heavy casualties. (Express News Agency, 28th)</p>

<p>Chongqing: A military spokesman said on the 27th that the main force of the Japanese army on the west bank of the Xiang River is still in Dangyang and its eastern regions. In addition, there is a considerable force of Japanese troops in the Jingmen, Yichang, and Jiangling areas, and a small number of Japanese troops in Shenjiaji, Shayang, and Shili Pu. Since last week, the Chinese army has completed a strong encirclement of each Japanese army and continued the most violent attacks. Seeing the situation becoming increasingly dangerous, the Japanese army strengthened its defensive fortifications. However, after the Chinese army's planned separate encirclement attacks, by the 24th, the remnants of the Japanese army's periphery had been almost completely wiped out, and the goal of absorbing the Japanese and gradually reducing them was successfully achieved. Therefore, the battle after the 25th fell into a stalemate. In the near future, the war situation on the west bank of the Xiang River will have a surprising development, because the Chinese army is determined to complete the determined annihilation of the Japanese.

<p>Chongqing: Ninety Japanese planes attacked the capital of China at around 10:00 AM on the 28th. The Chinese Air Force soared into the sky, waiting in battle. Half an hour later, they saw a group of Japanese planes breaking into the city airspace from the south. The Chinese Air Force launched a head-on attack. A fierce battle took place in the airspace over Changshou. One Japanese heavy bomber was shot down by the Chinese and crashed in Lijia Ba in the county. The remaining Japanese planes were injured and fled east. The Chinese Air Force returned safely. (Telegraph, 28th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: At 12:30 PM today, 120 Japanese planes flew into the airspace over Chongqing again, dropping more than 1,000 incendiary bombs into the city, causing fires everywhere. At that time, the weather was dry and hot. The incendiary bombs landed and instantly thick smoke rose and fierce flames spewed out. The entire city was enveloped in flames. Although air defense personnel, rescue personnel, and hundreds of volunteers disregarded danger and tried their best to rescue, the fire was very fierce and could not be extinguished for a while. It did not gradually die out until several hours after the air raid. The heavy losses from this great fire go without saying. How many lives were lost cannot be investigated or estimated. The air raid alarm lasted for two hours, and was lifted at 1:15 PM. Before dropping incendiary bombs into the city, the Japanese planes first bombed other places nearby. Central University, ten miles west of Chongqing, was also bombed.

<p>Tokyo: This morning, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson told newspaper reporters that, according to the guarantee made yesterday afternoon by French Ambassador Henri, even though the Governor-General of Vietnam has been replaced, the understanding between Japan and France regarding Vietnam will remain unchanged. It is said that the French Ambassador visited Japanese Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki at 5:00 PM yesterday, informing him that although the Bordeaux government decided on June 25th to transfer the Vietnamese Governor-General, he guaranteed that the understanding established between Japan and France regarding Vietnam would not be altered. A reporter asked, "According to Hong Kong newspapers, there may be a conflict between Vice Admiral Decoux, the Vietnamese Governor-General appointed by the Bordeaux government, and the former Governor-General Catroux, who is loyal to General de Gaulle and organizing a National Committee in London." The spokesperson replied that, in his view, France only has one government, which is the one that moved from Paris to Bordeaux. Another reporter inquired about rumors that Japanese Minister to The Hague, Ishii, would be recalled and sent to the Dutch East Indies. The spokesperson replied that the government had such a plan, but the details would be decided after the current Minister to the Netherlands, who has been recalled, arrives in Tokyo.

<p>Tokyo: A Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated that the Japanese government wants the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies government to actively adopt appropriate plans to reliably guarantee Japan's acquisition of the desired quantity of goods exported from the Dutch East Indies and to quickly resolve issues concerning Japanese businesses and the entry of Japanese nationals. Today, Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki met with Dutch Minister Pabst to discuss this matter. It is said that, from the standpoint of maintaining peace and security in East Asia, the Japanese government is deeply concerned about any developments that may affect the current situation in the Dutch East Indies. The Japanese government's declaration on this matter is issued in response to various political, economic, and other events. Since issuing this declaration, Japan has continued to negotiate with the Dutch government regarding Japanese commercial enterprises and the issue of Japanese nationals entering the Dutch East Indies. Japan is deeply concerned about maintaining and further enhancing close commercial relations between the two countries. An amicable resolution of these issues is not only a natural necessity in administrative relations between the two countries but also necessary to eliminate various anxieties and promote friendship between Japan and the Dutch East Indies. In light of these facts, the Japanese government's first step is to engage in negotiations with the Dutch government to ensure that the goods Japan needs from the Dutch East Indies can be exported to Japan. The Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies government have both announced that they do not want to implement any plans that would prevent these goods from being exported to Japan and will comply with Japan's wishes. The Japanese government is very pleased with this sincere attitude. (Reuters, 28th)</p>

<p>Washington: According to a survey by the U.S. Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce, U.S. import and export trade with China in 1939 both increased compared to 1938. In 1939, U.S. exports to China were valued at US$55,611,000, compared to US$34,719,000 in 1938 and US$49,703,000 in 1937. In 1939, U.S. imports from China were valued at US$61,831,000, compared to US$47,189,000 in 1938, which was still less than the US$103,662,000 in 1937. Thus, U.S. exports to China accounted for 1.8% of total U.S. exports to the world, while U.S. imports from China accounted for 2.7% of total imports. "The largest increase in U.S. exports to China was in agricultural products, followed by kerosene, scrap iron, tinware, and automobiles, etc. The largest decrease in exports to China was in aircraft parts. The largest increase in imports from China was in raw silk, with its value increasing from US$2,145,000 in 1938 to US$11,701,000. Tin imports last year increased by 67% compared to the previous year, but decreased by 41% compared to 1937. The import value of tungsten ore increased by 49%. The import value of hog bristles increased by 35%. Leather imports also increased. Due to increased difficulties in transporting from inland Chinese ports, the amount of tung oil imported into the U.S. decreased sharply, but because the price of tung oil increased, the total value of tung oil imported into the U.S. last year decreased only slightly. In December of last year, U.S. exports and imports to China both increased sharply due to rising prices caused by the outbreak of the European war. U.S. exports to China in December more than doubled compared to October and tripled compared to July, while imports from China increased by 44% in December compared to October and doubled compared to July. The largest increase in exports to China was in cotton, with cotton exports in December valued at US$5 million, followed by automobiles and parts, tobacco leaves, steel, scrap iron, and aniline dyes. The largest increase in imports from China in December was in tung oil, raw silk, and tungsten ore, with a total value of US$2 million. (United Press, 28th)</p>

<p>Philadelphia: The Republican National Convention, meeting here today, has, in the sixth ballot, decided to nominate Wendell Willkie, a public utilities giant, as the Republican presidential candidate. At the last minute, the powerful delegation from Pennsylvania unanimously voted for Willkie, and Willkie won 998 votes out of a possible maximum of 1,000 votes. Here, they celebrate Willkie as "a choice made by the people." The scenes in the Republican convention last night and early this morning were truly rare. Willkie is a staunch advocate of aiding the Allied powers, and each of his votes represents a formidable force. When the vote was taken, there were 14,000 people in attendance. The crowd cheered loudly as the vote counters announced each vote for Willkie. As Willkie's votes exceeded those of Senator Taft and Dewey, the crowd became even more excited. Before long, Willkie's votes accumulated to such a high number that it was certain he would be elected, and the crowd was overjoyed. Political observers all believe that the Republican convention has selected a presidential candidate with a great chance of defeating President Roosevelt. The Republican Party firmly believes that Roosevelt will still be selected as the Democratic presidential candidate, as there is no one else in the Democratic Party who can compete with Willkie. In the first two ballots, Dewey was in the lead, but by the fourth ballot, Willkie surged ahead and then remained fixed. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Philadelphia: The Republican National Convention has nominated ten U.S. presidential candidates, such as Wendell Willkie, a giant in the electricity public utility industry, Senator Robert Taft, son of former President William Taft, and Senator Vandenberg. Among them, Willkie and Taft have the highest support, and the competition is expected to be fierce. The final ballots began last night. The other seven candidates are New York District Attorney Dewey, editor Gannett, Senator Bridges, Pennsylvania Governor James, Senator McNary, Senator Whitefield, and McNider. Former President Hoover has not yet been nominated. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Republican Platform</p>
<p>Philadelphia: The ten-page Republican platform, which the party will use as a tool for its future presidential campaign, was adopted by the Republican National Convention last night. One of the articles in the platform advocates amending the Constitution to stipulate that a president cannot be re-elected more than twice. Regarding foreign policy issues, the platform states, "The Republican Convention firmly opposes the United States being drawn into foreign wars. The Republican Party aims to maintain Americanism, maintain peace, and engage in national defense preparations. The complete lack of preparation of the United States today, and the danger of the United States being drawn into war, are all the fault of the 'New Deal.' We advocate that the construction of the U.S. national defense should be rapid, orderly, and practical, so that it can defend the U.S. mainland, U.S. territories, and key outposts from enemy attacks, and can effectively implement the Monroe Doctrine. "The New Deal has already led the United States to failure. The reason for this is that it attempted to send Congress back to its homeland at a time when the world is extremely critical. Once the representatives of Congress leave, a single order can draw the United States into war." The platform does not directly mention Far East relations, although during the drafting process, some advocated a blockade against Japan, while others criticized the administration's actions as provoking Japan. However, these opinions were not formally included. The platform condemns countries that attack non-aggressive countries, saying that the United States should provide broad assistance to all countries that are fighting for freedom and to countries whose national freedom is threatened, but states that such assistance should not violate the principles of international law. The platform calls for actively defending U.S. territories and important outposts, including the Philippines. The platform accuses the New Deal of leaking U.S. military secrets and failing to understand the meaning of modern mechanized military defense, and criticizes the New Deal for tempting the American people to rely solely on the government forever, which not only weakens the American spirit but also violates the American traditional spirit.

<p>Tokyo: The "Asahi Shimbun" recently reported that after resigning as President of the Privy Council, Duke Fumimaro Konoe will devote himself to a one-party movement, thereby causing discord with Prime Minister Yonai. When Duke Konoe submitted his resignation, he originally wanted to recommend former Prime Minister Kiichiro Hiranuma to succeed him, but Prime Minister Yonai refused, and the position was changed to Vice President of the Privy Council, Yoshimichi Hara. People in political circles are all surprised by this matter. The reason for this is that Prime Minister Yonai believes that after Hiranuma's comeback and re-occupancy of important positions, he will inevitably form an axis with Konoe and Minister of the Imperial Household Koichi Kido, which would be detrimental to the current cabinet.

<h3 id="e34">Brief Biography of U.S. Republican Presidential Candidate Wendell Willkie <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The Republican National Convention has nominated Wendell Willkie as its presidential candidate in Philadelphia. He is a tall, unkempt man. He has no campaign organization, no campaign manager, no campaign funds, and no crowds. He is the chairman of the board of Southern Power Company and a director of First National Bank. His office in New York is close to Wall Street, and his residence is on the splendid Fifth Avenue, with a collection of 7,000 books.</p>
<p>He was born in Indiana, and his attitude and speeches have a Midwestern flavor. He is an ardent, outspoken liberal, as evidenced by his past career and recent speeches. He originally belonged to the Democratic Party. In 1924, he participated in the Democratic National Convention as a delegate from Ohio. Until 1932, he even voted for Roosevelt and donated $150 to the campaign.</p>
<p>After Roosevelt was elected president, he left the Democratic Party and became one of the most vehement opponents of the New Deal. No Republican candidate, no matter how long their history in the party, could attack the New Deal as completely as he does.</p>
<p>People from all walks of life in the United States are very interested in such a figure. For the past three months, he has been invited to give over 3,000 speeches, almost like a Hollywood star in the limelight.</p>
<p>Willkie was first proposed as a Republican presidential candidate on November 20th of last year at the Securities Club in the New York Bankers Association building. The proposer was General Johnson. Club members were initially doubtful when they heard this suggestion. A week later, Clyde, a Washington correspondent for the New York Times, also mentioned Wilkie and his qualifications as a presidential candidate in the newspaper's commentary column. Thus, rumors began to spread in New York and Washington that Wilkie might be a strong Republican presidential candidate.</p>
<p>At this time, many places invited Wilkie to give public speeches, and magazine editors constantly invited him to write articles. "Fortune Magazine" also invited him to express his political views. He published an article in the April issue of that magazine entitled "We the People." The article was clearly aimed at the New Deal, and its main idea was as follows: "You officials in power, separate industry and commerce from the lives of the people, and instill in them a doctrine of hatred and distrust. But we the people want to say: Industry and commerce are part of our daily lives. Damaging industry and commerce is damaging us. Therefore, give up the attitude of hatred and let our enterprises regain their freedom."</p>
<p>"Under the guise of reform, you restrict the rights of the people, reduce the power of the states, and place power in the hands of a few people. You have usurped our political power. We the people have to say to you: We no longer need a monopolistic government, just as we do not need a monopolistic industry and commerce. Return our traditional political power, liberate us, and govern us with law."</p>
<p>"You politicians of both parties! Mix up foreign and domestic affairs, and what we the people ask is: Give us a trustworthy foreign policy. We oppose aggressor countries, we seek foreign trade, and we recognize that our standard of living can only be raised by raising the standard of living of all countries in the world."</p>
<p>A few days later, a young lawyer from New York, Roth, voluntarily mailed 600 copies of this article and supported him as a presidential candidate. Three weeks later, a total of 70,000 copies of this text were printed and distributed in over forty states. Subsequently, four men and two women organized a "Volunteer Mailing Committee" to distribute Wilkie's speeches and established an office in a hotel, paying a monthly rent of $50.</p>
<p>By mid-May, popular support for Wilkie had spread to two-thirds of the country. It was at this time that Republican cadres realized that the movement to support Wilkie had occurred naturally.</p>
<p>Wilkie was born on February 18, 1892, in Elwood, Indiana. His father was a lawyer and a judge. His mother was the first female lawyer in Indiana. His ancestors were German.</p>
<p>At Indiana University, he was a well-known troublemaker. While in school, he helped his father win a lawsuit. During World War I, he joined the army as a captain and became famous for defending soldiers in military courts.</p>
<p>After the end of the war, he practiced law in Akron. He won a lawsuit in an anti-Ku Klux Klan case. He handled most of the important electrical business and railway lawsuits in Ohio. In 1929, he became legal counsel for Southern Electric Company. Four years later, he was elected chairman of the board of the company, which had a capital of $1,128,501,778 and whose business scope extended from Michigan to Pennsylvania. At that time, he was only forty-one years old.</p>
<p>In 1917, he married Miss Willkie and has a son named Felix, who is currently a senior at Princeton University.</p>
<p>Wendell Wilkie, the U.S. Republican presidential candidate, is an electrical industry giant with an annual salary of $75,000. Regarding foreign policy, he once said, "Americans unanimously advocate not participating in the war, but if we close our eyes and cover our ears and say: 'I am not interested in the changes in Europe,' then we will not be able to contribute to peace. The outcome of this war has a significant impact on the United States. We have nothing to fear if democratic countries win, but if dictatorial countries expand their power and get closer to our borders, then we will be less safe."</p>

<h3 id="e35">Finance  The London and New York Anglo-American Exchange Rates Are Close. The Shanghai Exchange Market Sees a Tightening of the Pound and Loosening of the Dollar. The Hong Kong Dollar Exchange Rate Fluctuates. <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices were revealed at 9:30 AM. The pound fell, while the exchange rate remained unchanged. The dollar exchange rate was adjusted to six yuan, an increase of 0.25. Other exchange rates were also uniformly listed looser. As for the domestic market situation, the underlying trend continued to be strong. Although there were slight pullbacks in the middle, due to oversupply, rock-bottom prices emerged. As a result, the New York pound soared again by 0.25, breaking through the four-yuan mark. It is said that the black market exchange rates between the British pound and the US dollar, and vice versa, have become equal. As for the reasons for the sharp rise, New York believes that all goods exported from the United Kingdom and the British Empire will soon be calculated at the official pound exchange rate. Therefore, importers are seizing this last opportunity to buy pounds at prices lower than the official exchange rate. Another theory is that a new regulation completely prohibiting the use of free pounds is also expected to be announced soon. Therefore, the opening of the market showed a tightening of the pound and an increase in the dollar. Subsequently, Hong Kong electrical company speculators aggressively sold off, with the loosest dollar exchange rate reaching 6.3125 yuan. Later, Chinese banks and others slightly bought in, causing a slight rebound. The noon closing price was firm at the current dollar exchange rate of 6.3125 yuan. In the afternoon, rumors of peace in Europe slightly affected sentiment. At that time, sellers stopped selling aggressively, and speculators and American banks had an appetite for buying, resulting in a softening. However, before the close, Japanese banks and cotton mills came to sell, causing the exchange rate to loosen again. As a result, the gold pound was 3 shillings 8.4375 pence, and the dollar exchange rate was 6.28125 yuan, which was 0.09375 yuan tighter for the pound and 0.09375 yuan looser for the dollar compared to the previous day. Futures were tighter than spot prices.</p>
<p>Dollar Exchange Rate Listed at Six Yuan</p>
<p>Early this morning, London long positions rose by nearly 0.4375, and distant positions rose by 0.3125. New York silver prices remained flat, and London raw gold remained stable.

The dollar rose by 0.25 against the pound and by 0.25 against the Shanghai yuan. There was no market for the French franc. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened with a spot selling price of 3 shillings 8.125 pence for the gold pound and 6.25 yuan for the dollar, which was 0.125 tighter for the pound and 0.09375 looser for the dollar compared to the previous day's closing price, due to the sharp rise in the exchange rate. After the opening, Chinese speculators and Hong Kong electrical companies came to sell off, causing the market to loosen. The July dollar exchange rate of Chinese speculators selling to foreign banks was 6.15625 yuan. Also, the Hong Kong electrical company sold the same month's dollar exchange rate to foreign banks at 6.15625 yuan to 6.1875 yuan. HSBC's listed prices were revealed, and the pound exchange rate remained flat, while the dollar exchange rate rose by 0.25 to 6 yuan. Other exchange rates, such as the Japanese yen, Dutch guilder, and Luxembourg franc, were also uniformly listed looser. The silver equalization tax was announced to increase by 2.50%. After this, American banks and foreign banks continued to trade the July dollar exchange rate at 6.1875 yuan. At one point, the spot dollar exchange rate reached 6.3125 yuan. However, at around 10:15 AM, Chinese banks and speculators suddenly had an appetite for buying, and the market situation slightly softened. Chinese banks and others bought in spot dollars from 6.28125 yuan to 6.1875 yuan, and the July dollar exchange rate also rose from 6.1875 yuan to 6.125 yuan. Subsequently, because American banks and Hong Kong electrical companies continued to sell aggressively, their positions remained abundant, and prices gradually turned firmer. The July dollar exchange rate was sold by American banks and Hong Kong electrical companies to foreign banks at 6.1875 yuan, and the spot dollar exchange rate was 6.21875 yuan. The noon closing result was a dollar exchange rate of 6.3125 yuan and a gold pound of 3 shillings 8.75 pence, both 0.0625 looser than the morning opening.</p>

The tightest spot was previously quoted at 3 shillings 8.125 pence. Later, Chinese banks, East Asian banks, and Japanese banks and cotton mills uniformly sold off, causing prices to loosen again.

<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: the trends of British and American gold notes diverged. The former sharply rose by 0.3 yuan, while the latter once retreated to 15.8 yuan, but finally rebounded slightly to 16.1 yuan, a sharp decrease of 0.2 yuan compared to the previous day, due to the influence of the pound's sharp rise.

<h3 id="e37">Low Prices Maintain, the Gold Market Can Be Called Stable <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's black market for spot gold was exceptionally stable. Although foreign exchange rates slightly rose, especially the dollar exchange rate, the gold price was not affected in any way. Purchasers of gold were enthusiastic, and low prices were maintained. There was no shortage of such people. The morning opened with a drop of 100 yuan, to 5,300 yuan. Subsequently, the drop continued slightly, but the securities firms and gold shops all came to buy in at that time, so it soon rose to 5,400 yuan. Later, it was suppressed by the selling of gold firms, and before the close, it fell to 5,335 yuan. The noon closing price was 5,345 yuan. The situation in the afternoon market was still flat. Subsequently, securities firms, gold shops, and money exchange businesses all came to sell, and the price slightly fell and did not rise. Because retail investors bought in, it once reached a high of 5,410 yuan. However, gold firms continued to sell, and it fell again to 5,370 yuan. The closing price was 5,380 yuan, only 20 yuan lower than the previous day. Trading throughout the day was still brisk, about 4,000 taels. The price of gold jewelry in gold shops was eventually stable. The price of customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Only Fell by 20 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (10 taels) initially saw a sharp rise in quasi-convertibility, and the dollar exchange rate loosened, resulting in strong selling sentiment at the opening. First, money exchange businesses sold 10 taels to gold shops for 5,300 yuan, 100 yuan lower than the previous day. Because there were still many sellers, it fell another 20 yuan. Gold shops sold 20 taels to gold firms, inferior to 5,280 yuan. The foreign exchange rate then tightened, stimulating buying interest. Money exchange businesses, gold shops, and gold firms successively bought in, and a certain gold firm and a certain securities firm also bought in the middle. Soon, it soared by 120 yuan. Gold shops bought 50 taels from gold firms for 5,400 yuan. Unexpectedly, at this time, the foreign exchange rate loosened again, and selling sentiment revived. A certain gold firm turned from buying to selling, and cash firms and many retail investors followed suit to sell off, seeing a drop of 65 yuan again. Securities firms sold 20 taels to gold shops, retreating to 5,335 yuan. Before the close, gold shops slightly bought in, showing a slight rebound. Gold firms sold 10 taels to gold shops for 5,345 yuan as the noon closing price. The market opened slightly sluggish in the afternoon. Gold shops sold 10 taels to gold firms for 5,340 yuan. Before long, gold shops sold off again, and it fell another 10 yuan. Gold shops traded 20 taels with each other, falling to 5,330 yuan. Later, a certain gold shop and money exchange business successively bought in aggressively. Although a certain gold firm sold off in the middle, the exchange market reported a tightening, causing securities firms and others to follow suit to buy in. Soon, it broke through the 5,400 yuan mark. Gold shops bought dozens of taels from securities firms and others, rising to 5,410 yuan. After entering, buying interest gradually dissipated, and it re-entered a sluggish state. The price continued to fall by 40 yuan due to the continuous selling of a certain gold firm. Gold shops sold 20 taels to securities firms for 5,370 yuan. Before the close, a certain securities firm came to buy in again and was slightly pulled up. Securities firms bought 30 taels from gold firms for 5,380 yuan, as the evening closing price. As a result, it continued to fall by 20 yuan compared to the previous day. There were 130 yuan ups and downs throughout the day. The selling price of the cash firm's own-brand gold was dozens of yuan higher than the spot gold, and the purchase price was reduced by more than 30 yuan. The current standard gold was 50 to 60 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little open trading.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Securities Domestic Bonds Are Still Being Bought, British Bank Shares Are Falling <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>In the black market for securities, prices rose again yesterday as a certain bank continued to buy in, but the upward trend stabilized in the afternoon due to the cessation of purchasing. However, the amount of circulating chips in the market has therefore decreased again, and it is still not easy to quickly return to small amounts. Banks are closing accounts, and principal and interest are due, so short sellers are not without caution. Today, there will only be half-day trading in the morning, and the afternoon will be dedicated to handling same-day settlements because tomorrow is Sunday, and the following Monday and Tuesday are bank settlement holidays. Yesterday morning, a certain bank continued to buy 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, still through Yongfeng Hao as an agent. Others, such as Defu Hong, Da Shun Kang, and Lianyi, also bought in. Buyers were mostly Trade &amp; Development and Zheng Dachang. Hong Kang Xin Chang also sold off with the market. The noon closing was about 0.2 yuan to 0.3 yuan better. In the afternoon, Xie Da bought a relatively small amount on behalf of others. The 14th and Tong Kang also had strong demand. The 4th and Tong Shun sold a lot. Market prices stabilized slightly. As a result, the performance rose by 0.1 yuan to 0.35 yuan. The total number of transactions still exceeded 1 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 50 shares of Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory were traded at a price of 14 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's trading in public and stock markets was mostly limited to weekend settlements and short covering. The turnover increased slightly. The situation was better at the opening because short covering activities also attracted new buyers.</p>
<p>London, 27th (Thursday) Telegram. Today's listed prices of Far Eastern British companies' shares: bank shares fell again. The price of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China fell by 8 shillings and 9 pence, to 5 pounds 11 shillings and 3 pence. The price of HSBC's London-registered shares fell by 2 pounds, to 53 pounds. Also, the price of Hong Kong-registered shares fell by 5 pounds, to 55 pounds. The rest remained unchanged.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Food  Flour Prices Rise Three Times in a Week, Each Bag Rises by 1.4 Yuan <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, spot flour prices rose again. The price of the No. 2 flour mill rose by 0.5 yuan since the beginning of this week. On Wednesday, it rose by another 0.4 yuan, and yesterday (Friday), it rose by another 0.5 yuan, already shouted at a price of 15.2 yuan. The price of each bag has risen by a huge 1.4 yuan in one week. Although the mills seem to be rising too fast due to the cost of new wheat, the general public cannot afford it. It is reported that the authorities are quite concerned about this and held a meeting yesterday to discuss ways to stabilize prices. Since the factory price has already increased three times, it should be able to supply as much as possible. Therefore, the two mills continued to sell 14,000 to 15,000 bags yesterday, while customer groups and hoarders stopped selling altogether. Therefore, the recovered goods are all above 16 yuan, which is especially concerned by general traders and hoarders.</p>
<p>The source of new wheat is gradually becoming more abundant, but only Japanese merchants have received the so-called transportation permits, while Chinese merchants are still not settled. Therefore, Japanese factories are busy with processing, with several thousand to 10,000 bags every day, at prices between 23 yuan and 24 yuan, depending on the quality. Chinese factories in this environment can only lower prices to absorb it. It is reported that the Fu and Fu mills processed 4,000 to 5,000 bags of Beijing-Shanghai train and ship wheat yesterday, and the selling price was also slightly higher.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Rice Prices Seen Not Rising Again in the Afternoon <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Since the rice market rebounded again after the previous period of softening, the opening yesterday morning saw general customers still hoping that the market would step lower, and the situation was unusually quiet. Sellers, seeing that the situation in Southeast Asia was not peaceful, still had no intention of lightly selling off. So, under this stalemate, the market presented an ordinary situation. This dragged on for a long time until the shops on this street realized that the market was not small and actively proceeded with processing. Floating hoarders and retail investors became active in the middle, and shouts began to rise. The prices of various foreign rice gradually rose. As a result, the closing price of No. 1 Chen Saigon was again at 63 yuan to 62.5 yuan, No. 2 at 61 yuan to 60.05 yuan, No. 1 Siam at 62.6 yuan, fire-milled at 62 yuan, and small-milled at 60.04 yuan. However, polished rice and red rice are traditionally mainly sold by mainland traders, and since this has stopped and the countryside is also relaxed, they presented a flat and tired state, with not much stubbornness. The price of Tokyo polished pointy rice fell from 57 yuan to 56 yuan, and Haiphong red rice was 57 to 58 yuan. Only rice husks and mixed broken rice were even more decadent. Rice husks were only sold for 52 yuan to 51.5 yuan, and mixed broken rice, except for special grade rice husks for 50 yuan, was from 49.5 yuan to 48.5 yuan. However, in the afternoon, due to rumors that the Japanese army was trying to cross Vietnam and was about to affect Hong Kong, traders took the opportunity to raise prices, and short sellers, new hoarders, and speculative winds became active again. The prices of various foreign rice rose across the board. The lowest price of No. 2 Saigon in the morning was 60.02 to 60.03 yuan, but the evening closing price was as high as 62 yuan, and small-milled was as high as 61.2 yuan. The price of Siam No. 2 was up to 61.6 yuan, not only 1 or 2 yuan higher than the morning low, but also nearly 1 yuan higher than the previous night. The recovered rice was 67.5 yuan to 68 yuan for 18-pack rice and 66.3 yuan for 26-pack rice. Also, the current purchase price of No. 2 rice was 75.5 yuan, totaling 225 tons. It is said that the spot rice transaction was 9,000 bags because mainland rural brokers and traders absorbed it after the midday market.</p>
<p>The arrival of japonica and glutinous domestic rice increased significantly yesterday by more than 2,000 bags, most of which were japonica. Rumors of fatigue in the black market for japonica rice outside the market, resulting in few transactions, and the selling price continued to depreciate significantly. Changbang special clear japonica rice was 71 to 72 yuan, Su Kun Changzhou white japonica rice was 70 yuan, and the price of old goods was 68.5 yuan. The price of Qing Si thin rice was mostly unable to open, and the opening price was as high as 71 yuan, while the price of old hot goods was 68.5 yuan. Nangan early rice special grade was 68.5 yuan, and the next grade was 67.5 yuan. The arrival of glutinous rice was rare, and the price was low. Although the sales floor was not considered refreshing, the owners were firm in their intention to sell, and the market presented a stable situation, similar to before. Jin Li special yuan was 60 yuan to 59.5 yuan, Chang Dan white yuan was 57 to 58 yuan, and Jiangbei goods were around 56 yuan.</p>

<p>Since the soybean cake market opened, it has not encountered setbacks. Its gradual upward momentum is entirely created by speculators. However, at this time of strong sales, the original good situation has actually weakened sales after the rain. Yesterday, a part of the floating hoarders saw that the situation was not good and feared that it would be difficult to maintain, so they were eager to sell off. The market immediately softened. In short, it is an extraordinary time, and the purchasing power is not strong. Yesterday, only more than 3,000 pieces of Dayou Factory's four-brand cake were traded, with a spot price of 13.5 yuan and a price of 13.55 yuan for the first half of July. 4,000 pieces of Shenji cake were traded, with a spot price of 13 yuan to 12.9 yuan and a price of 13.1 yuan to 13.05 yuan for the first half of July. One car of Yuanlong cake was traded at a price of 12.85 yuan. 500 pieces of Qingzhong cake were traded at a price of 12.3 yuan.</p>

<p>The yarn market is still flat and tired, and the trend is initially falling and then rebounding. This is because the actual sales floor is deserted, and with the end of June settlement period approaching, most of the long positions are unable to take delivery, and they have to bear the pain of cutting losses. Therefore, the market is still loose. The low peak of 20-count Double Horse once reached 800 yuan. After that, short covering for profit recovered to 860 yuan. The future still lies in the current sales.</p>
<p>When the spot yarn opened in the morning, because the foreign exchange situation hardened, buyers in the market still lacked enthusiasm. In addition, the factories also came to take delivery, and retail positions tended to sell off. The table was still loose. 20-count Double Horse was 840 yuan, falling straight to 800 yuan. Later, as the longs came to buy cheap goods, it slightly rebounded one step. However, the sales of customer groups were still not brilliant. The closing price was 850 yuan. According to the statistics of the number of transactions during the day, 2,755 packages were traded, and the price of 20-count Double Horse fell by 35 yuan. 135 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today. The amount purchased by each gang is listed on the left.</p>

<p>Spot cotton trading is still dull because yarn sales in the southwest are not smooth, so the factories' intake is blocked and the transaction of business is still as rare as phoenix feathers. However, those who hold the goods need cash, and the selling price is willing to be particularly cheap, but those who try to eat are still not enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Another message: the market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, although the market is small, is very firm. A part of the short covering and spot trading is still active. As a result, the closing price rose slightly by 5 to 6 pounds from today. The Indian cotton market is rumored that the government is especially insured, so the market is active, and yesterday it rose 6 to 7 rupees along with the forecast.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai foreign cotton market, Chinese manufacturers have been unusually quiet in recent days, but Japanese manufacturers are more active in purchasing raw cotton because yarn sales are very good, but the payment period has been slightly extended.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Piece Goods Cotton Cloth Sales Turn Prosperous <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, domestic cloth continued to sell off loose goods in small amounts due to end-of-month payment reasons, and the selling trend was still soft. The enthusiasm of hoarders was weak, and the price of goods still depended on the insistence of actual sales and those who held the goods for support. The price of white goods, coarse and fine cloth, and bleached and dyed cloth continued to fall by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan per piece. The wholesale number of this street imported 15,000 to 16,000 pieces of coarse cloth, gray cloth, twill, colored cloth, and bleached cloth. Dyeing factories imported nearly 10,000 pieces of gray cloth, most of which were transported and sold to the guerrilla areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. The Shandong gang purchased more than 100 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill, and the Zhejiang East Wenzhou and Ningbo gangs purchased more than 200 pieces of fine cloth, colored cloth, and coarse cloth. Singapore and Siam purchased 2,000 pieces of colored cloth and bleached cloth from abroad.</p>
<p>The East cloth market first fell and then rose yesterday, and the situation turned firm. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth fell to 27.8 yuan at the opening in the morning, and Four Gentlemen serge was 0.825 yuan. Later, because the industry covered shorts and wholesale and dyeing factories in this street also came to purchase, the market atmosphere tightened. In the afternoon, the Dragon Head fine cloth rebounded to 30 yuan, and the serge was 0.88 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Sugar Market Diao Qing Sees New High Price <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign sugar market was still downstream. The guild drew the disc. The spot price of 24 rough white foreign warehouses was 67.5 yuan to 67.7 yuan for small triangles, and the transfer goods with a warehouse list hit on July 2 was 54 yuan, falling by 1 yuan. The price of TaiKoo car white B mark was 78.5 yuan, also down 1 yuan. The Dutch red was still 59.4 yuan. Although the transaction of domestic sugar was small, the firm and stable state did not decrease at first, and Diao Qing saw a new high price, almost on par with rough white, which is unprecedented in history. 50 packages of white Gao Diao Qing were 65.5 yuan, and 150 packages were 65 yuan, rising by 1.5 yuan to 1 yuan. 100 packages of oil second were still 63.5 yuan. Also, 135 packages of sugar came from Haikou yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e47">North and South Goods Green Bamboo Shoots Arrive in Large Quantities, the Market Also Loosens <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Because the waterways in the green bamboo shoot production area have been opened, the source is still flowing smoothly to Hangzhou by bamboo raft, and the number is large. It is estimated that more than 2,000 pieces have arrived in Shanghai before and after, so the market situation immediately softened. Yesterday, Gao Fei Ting was sold for 2.8 yuan, and Xiao Erjiao was a common 2.5 yuan, Gao Tu Ting was 2.4 yuan, the same drop, ordinary 2.1 yuan. Zao Yuan has not yet been traded, and the future has a continuous loosening trend.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Coal, No Worries About White Coal Dust Shortages <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Hongji white coal dust has been shipped here by steamer continuously in recent days. The market no longer worries about shortages. Coal ball factories also have raw material reserves for two or three months. Public confidence is stable, and prices are nominally fixed but actually flexible. Although some firms still adhere to the old price of 140 yuan per disc, hoarders are selling off their stock at 7-8 yuan below the market price, thus the shops on this street are also reducing prices across the board.</p>

<h3 id="e49">British Ambassador Broadcasts Today, Locals and Foreigners Attach Great Importance, Portuguese Community Raises Large Sums to Help Britain in the War <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, came to Shanghai from Chongqing this time and originally planned to go north to Beidaihe for a summer vacation. However, due to the tense situation and important political affairs that need to be dealt with urgently, his departure has been delayed and his trip is uncertain. It is now known that the ambassador will give a broadcast speech today. Not only is the British community in Shanghai excited and attaching great importance to the news, but countless Chinese friends also feel that since the ambassador arrived in Shanghai many days ago, they have not been able to see his demeanor in public. Now that he is broadcasting on the air, they can hear his famous words and wise opinions, which can be used as help from others.</p>
<p>Recent Photo of British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr</p>
<p>Two Broadcast Speeches Today</p>
<p>The ambassador's broadcast today is divided into two sessions, at noon and in the evening. The times are 12:45 PM and 9:00 PM, broadcast by XMHD (frequency 760 kHz, wavelength 395 meters) and XCDN (frequency 1440 kHz, wavelength 208 meters). The ambassador's speech is clear, with a calm and pleasant tone. At that time, the masses in Shanghai will be able to hear his voice through the airwaves in one room.</p>
<p>Ambassador's Speech at the Beginning of the European War</p>
<p>At the beginning of the European war last autumn, the ambassador once gave a public speech to the British community in Shanghai. His words were sharp and his sentences vivid. To summarize the main points, there are still some that can be retold. At that time, the British community in Shanghai, upon hearing that their motherland had declared war on Germany, rose up to volunteer to defend their country. The ambassador was extremely moved by the patriotic enthusiasm of his compatriots. However, due to the long distance and transportation difficulties, the British community in Shanghai all had normal occupations. If they could hold on to their positions, it would be a way to serve the country, and there was no need to rush to the battlefield. Therefore, there was a passage in his speech, which roughly meant: "When the last major war broke out, I was younger and worked in the diplomatic field. When I heard that my country was in trouble, my blood boiled, just like yours, and I wanted to go to the front line to fight. However, my superiors did not comply with my wishes. At that time, I felt very angry. Now, time flies, and twenty years have passed in a flash. The situation at that time is still vivid in my mind, and I have only grown older. Looking back on the past, I feel that what my superiors said was very true. I hope that you will also work hard in your positions, and when the government orders, you will immediately respond to the call and go to the national crisis together." His words were earnest and sincere, and it is hoped that the British community in Shanghai will be able to understand the ambassador's meaning.</p>
<p>Portuguese Community Urges Compatriots to Help Britain</p>
<p>A certain member of the Portuguese community in Shanghai sent a letter to the North-China Daily News yesterday, and attached a donation of 50 yuan, stating that it was to help the British soldiers on the front line. The letter expressed great sympathy for the British soldiers, and called on the Portuguese community in Shanghai to rise up, donate large sums of money, and contribute to Britain's war expenses. The letter stated, "I would like to call on the Portuguese community who serve in British factories and businesses to do their best to help the British army in the war. The Portuguese community in Shanghai and Hong Kong should all be aware of the importance and seriousness of the British army's continued operations. The Portuguese community has received great help from the British, which is an undeniable fact, so we should show great sympathy to the British and do our best to help them. I hope that what I have said can deeply arouse the attention of the Portuguese community everywhere." Finally, he said that he had attached 50 yuan to be used for any donation to Britain. Although this amount is very small, he has done his best.</p>
<p>Ambassador Johnson to Come to Shanghai Next Month</p>
<p>American Ambassador to China, Dr. Nelson Trusler Johnson, has been in Chongqing for nearly half a year. Now, due to the hot weather, he will go to Beidaihe to escape the summer heat. It is scheduled that he will fly from Chongqing to Hong Kong by China National Aviation Corporation on July 4, and then transfer to the President Coolidge, which is returning from Little Luzon to Shanghai via Hong Kong. The ambassador will arrive here on July 9, stay in Shanghai for a short time, and then buy a ticket to go north to meet his family, and then go to Beidaihe together. It is said that the ambassador's wife and daughter are currently living in Beiping. In December of last year, the ambassador took a special trip from Chongqing to Shanghai and then to Beiping to celebrate his daughter's fourth birthday.</p>
<p>Italian Ambassador Marquis to Go North on Schedule</p>
<p>Italian Ambassador to China, Marquis Raffaele Paolucci di Valmagra, quietly left the French Concession after Italy declared war on France and resided at the Italian Embassy on Chengdu Road. According to sources, Marquis Paolucci has returned to his original residence in the French Concession after France and Italy announced an armistice. Marquis Paolucci is scheduled to leave Shanghai by Japanese ship on July 5 to go north for the summer. At that time, the embassy staff will accompany him. The embassy office will be stationed in Beidaihe for a long time. After that, the embassy affairs in Shanghai may be moved to North China.</p>

<p>July 14 is the French National Day, which is the anniversary of the success of the French Revolution in 1789 when the French people opposed the autocratic politics of Louis XVI. The French community in Shanghai celebrates the day on a large scale every year. According to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency who inquired with the French community, although the current situation is extraordinary, the anniversary will still be celebrated as usual, but it is not intended to be too extravagant, and the form will be simpler than in previous years.</p>
<h3 id="e51">The Iron Gate of Xiaodongmen Opened Again Yesterday Morning <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Since the "August 13th" Shanghai Battle occurred and the Chinese army withdrew to the west, the iron gates on the border of the French Concession's Pushi South City have been closed. It was not until the spring of this year that the French authorities opened the iron gates at Xinkaihe, Xinqiao Street, Nanyang Bridge, Xie Bridge and other places leading to Pushi one after another. In recent days, it has been rumored that the French Concession will completely open all the iron gates that have not been opened, but this has not yet become a reality. However, at around 7:00 AM yesterday morning, the French authorities suddenly sent personnel to open the iron gate of Xiaodongmen.</p>

<p>Since the coastal provinces have been successively occupied, the number of Japanese immigrants to China has been increasing with the power of their army. According to a survey by the East Asia Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as of April 1, the number of Japanese residents in China was 255,261.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Japanese Side and French Concession Establish Police Agreement. The Specific Details of the Agreement Have Not Been Publicly Announced by Either Side. The Japanese Side's Aim is to Suppress "Terrorists" <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>This newspaper reported yesterday on the establishment of a police agreement between the Japanese side and the French Concession, which has now been confirmed. According to Japanese newspapers, "The head of the Shanghai Japanese Military Police, on June 21st, presented a note to the French Concession Municipal Council regarding the agreement, including: 1. Extradition of criminals; 2. Joint searches; 3. Interrogation; and other matters desired by the Japanese military. On the 25th, the French Municipal Council largely accepted the wishes of the Japanese military authorities and sought to closely cooperate between the Japanese and French police forces in the future. This agreement came into effect on the 27th." According to foreign sources, the content of this agreement is roughly the same as that concluded between the Japanese side and the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement in March last year.</p>
<p>Japanese Official Announcement</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported, "The Japanese military authorities here issued an official announcement last night (27th) at 6 PM, stating that regarding the suppression of anti-Japanese elements in the French Concession, the Japanese military authorities and the French Concession Municipal Council have reached a compromise. This agreement was reached after negotiations between the two sides. It is noted that after the police agreement was reached between the International Settlement and the Japanese military authorities in March last year, "terrorists" from Chongqing were "expelled" from the International Settlement. Because the French Municipal Council did not reach an agreement with the Japanese military authorities on suppressing anti-Japanese elements, and the French municipal authorities only provided the Japanese side with friendly cooperation, Chongqing terrorists and their organizations gradually concentrated in the French Concession.</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p>Major General Miura, head of the Japanese Military Police, sent a note to the French Concession authorities last Friday, explaining the Japanese side's desire to suppress Chongqing terrorists, including transferring captured anti-Japanese elements to the Japanese side and joint searches and interrogations by French and Japanese authorities. By this Thursday, the French Municipal Council expressed its approval of the Japanese side's proposal, especially regarding cooperation between the French and Japanese police authorities. Yesterday, the Japanese military authorities were notified in writing.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Japanese Advocates for Return of German Buildings; German Side Denies <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun published an article the day before yesterday, surprisingly advocating for the return of the French Club on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession to the German side. The newspaper claimed that the original site of the French Club was a German building, and next to it was the German Garden, so the newspaper believed that the French Club on Avenue Joffre should be returned to the German side. However, the newspaper also stated that when the German Embassy spokesperson was asked whether the French Club would be ceded to Germany, he said, "The German officials in this city have no authority to decide on this issue." This speculation by the Japanese side is clearly fabricated.</p>

<p>The general final account of the profit surplus of various banks in this city for the first half of the year can be concluded tomorrow. The semi-annual settlement of money shops can also be completed tomorrow. According to a reporter from Da Guang News Agency who inquired in financial circles yesterday, the four banks of Central, China, Communications, and Agriculture are actively rushing to complete the settlement procedures. Other major commercial savings banks have also separately ordered the full amount of principal and interest of fixed, current, special, and communication deposits to be settled. Fixed-term current deposits and short- and long-term loans of money shops have been limited to being cleared tomorrow. As for the deposit departments of the four major companies such as Wing On and Sincere, as well as the deposits of pawnshop counterparts and the deposit and remittance accounts of the postal savings and remittance bureau, they are also scheduled to be completely processed by tomorrow evening.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Bloody Incident on Fujian Road Last Night: Mu Shiying Assassinated by Gunfire. Thugs Fled Immediately After Opening Fire, Leaving No Trace. Rickshaw Puller Also Wounded by Stray Bullet. <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Writer Mu Shiying, 35 years old, from Zhejiang, at 7:25 PM yesterday, wearing a light gray Prince suit, was riding in a rickshaw, passing the entrance of Fengtai Foreign Goods Store on Fujian Road, when suddenly thugs came forward, blocked the way, and immediately pulled out guns, ambushing him with gunfire, firing several shots in succession. At that time, Mu was shot twice, once in the chest and once in the abdomen, and immediately fell to the ground from the rickshaw.</p>
<p>Lying in a pool of blood, his breath was faint. Rickshaw puller Tang Jikun (26 years old, from Jiangbei) was also injured in the right foot by a stray bullet. The shooters, seeing that their goal had been achieved, immediately fled. The nearby Chinese police heard the sound and rushed to the scene, but the shooters were already far away and gone without a trace. They urgently called an ambulance to send Mu Shiying and rickshaw puller Tang Jikun to Renji Hospital for treatment, but Mu died before reaching the hospital due to injuries to vital organs.</p>
<p>It was announced that he had died. Tang Jikun's foot bone was seriously injured and he was hospitalized for treatment. The Central Police Station received the report and immediately sent a large number of detectives to conduct a thorough investigation at the scene. The police are investigating the cause of the attack. It is rumored that he had recently participated in the work of a certain party.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Shanghai Municipal Council Notice: Additional Taxes to Be Implemented in July. The French Concession's Additional Tax Increase May Be Reverted. <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement's increase of 50% in taxes, after being passed by the annual meeting of foreign taxpayers on April 17th of this year, taxpayers in the settlement repeatedly requested an extension, which was not accepted. Recently, the council has announced to all sectors that it will charge fees according to the new tax rates passed by the annual meeting of taxpayers, starting from the day after tomorrow, including: (1) For all kinds of Chinese and foreign houses, starting from July 1st, an additional surcharge of 50% will be added to both the municipal general tax and the municipal special tax. The tax payments for Western-style houses should be sent directly to the council's tax collection section on Jiangxi Road by the residents upon receiving the notice, and no personnel will be dispatched to collect them. (2) Land tax: Starting from July 1st, an additional surcharge of 50% should be added. After receiving the notice, taxpayers should send it directly to the council's tax collection section, and no personnel will be dispatched to collect it. (3) All license fees and other fees collected: Starting from July 1st, an additional surcharge of 50% will be added uniformly. All payments should be made on time according to the previous payment method.</p>
<p>The French Concession May Terminate the Tax Increase</p>
<p>Regarding the French Concession Municipal Council's implementation of a tax increase from July 1st, according to reliable news obtained by a Da Zhong News Agency reporter from the French Concession, the staff of the Municipal Council's tax affairs department are currently engaged in preparing all the necessary procedures for the tax increase, but have not yet received a formal collection order from the authorities. The Chinese directors and Chinese committee members of the French Concession are making every possible effort to plead for all the residents of the French Concession and strive to stop the implementation of this measure. At a minimum, it is necessary to obtain a reduction in the percentage of the tax increase and a postponement of the implementation period. However, French Consul General Mr. O'Rein is always mindful of the suffering of citizens after the increase in burden, cares about the people's livelihood, and is extremely wise. His relationship with the Chinese people is always harmonious. He had previously made an informal statement to influential figures in the Chinese community of the French Concession, expressing his willingness to consider the tax increase issue. Therefore, the problem of tax increase in the French Concession may be reversed, and a formal statement should be made within a day or two. As for the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession, it is eagerly awaiting a formal written reply from the French Municipal Council so that it can take the scheduled negotiation steps. It is also reported by reliable sources that the French Concession's financial budget has always been balanced and has a surplus. The proposed tax increase this time was originally intended to remit the surplus to France to cover war expenses. Now that the Franco-German war has ended, the tax increase is really unnecessary.</p>
<p>French Business Water and Electricity Companies Not Allowed to Increase Prices</p>
<p>It is also reported that the French-owned water and electricity company planned to request a 40% price increase from July 1st. According to a reporter's confirmation, this request has been formally rejected by the board of directors of the French Municipal Council. However, it is rumored that the company intends to request again that it be implemented starting from August.</p>

As of the time of this reporter's writing, no solution had been heard of.</p>

<p>Recently, Yongxing Metal Products Factory in this city requested the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to record changes in partnership shareholders. The Chamber of Commerce stated that according to Article 19 of the Commercial Registration Law, the abolition, change, or transfer of a registered business name may not be used to oppose a bona fide third party without registration. In addition, Rule 17 of the Implementing Rules of the Commercial Registration Law states that for the registration of a business name transfer, the application should be jointly filed by both the transferor and the transferee, and the original or a copy of the transfer contract should be attached. Therefore, the factory's partnership transfer registration should be submitted to the ministry for application in accordance with legal procedures. The factory has been notified by letter to handle it according to law. It is also heard that regarding commercial registration, the Chamber of Commerce has accepted agency services starting from July 1st, including various registrations such as establishment and transfer.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Price of Rice in Pudong Drops by Ten Yuan; Rice Prices in Shanghai Fall. Autumn Harvest is Promising, and Rice Transportation from Hong Kong is Smooth Again. Based on the Current Situation, Rice Prices Will Gradually Decrease. <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Since the day before yesterday, rain has fallen sufficiently in the suburbs, and farmers are delighted. In Pudong, rice prices dropped instantly. According to people who came from there, since the day after the rain, the price has fallen by as much as ten yuan per picul, which proves that the price increase before the rain was not due to a shortage of goods, but actually due to rice merchants preventing famine, which is not enough to be used as a lesson. Rice prices in Shanghai have fallen slightly in recent days, which is a small relief for the poor. According to people in the rice industry, this is because agricultural crops in rice-producing areas and the suburbs of Shanghai</p>
<p>Suddenly received timely rain, and recently, 15,000 to 16,000 bags of rice shipped to Shanghai from Saigon and Siam have arrived, and those who continue to order are also on the way to Shanghai one after another. Speculators are panicked because of the above two reasons and have to sell to recover funds. New speculators are forced by the realistic situation and dare not speculate again. Therefore, rice prices are falling. Although the amount of the drop is not very large, judging from the current situation, prices will still gradually decrease. However, due to continuous rain and transportation difficulties, the arrival of domestic rice is not as strong as before. Therefore, the selling price of domestic rice remains firm. Currently, shipping between Shanghai and Hong Kong is still very smooth, the market transaction is more stable, and cargo owners find it difficult to raise prices on the pretext. Buyers have weak appetite due to the above situation, so</p>
<p>Transactions are weak. It is also reported that July 1st (Monday) is the date for the silver and money industry in this city to close accounts for the 29th year. The rice industry tea parties will be closed for one day on this day and will resume business as usual on the 2nd. Also, the noodle restaurant industry in this city had previously sent representatives Zhou Fumin and Liu Xinhe to petition Mr. H.E. Arnhold, Deputy Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, requesting measures to</p>
<p>Supply plain flour to facilitate business. Yesterday, Mr. Arnhold replied that he had agreed with various factories to follow the previous decision method (the industry has 175 members, the previous three major factories each received one bag per day, the 33 large factories received two bags per day, and the 49 factories received none). 159 bags are sold at a discounted price of 15 yuan per bag every day. The funds are collected by the guild and paid to Ruiji Flour Store the day before, and the flour is distributed the next day. The period for discounted sales is from now until the end of July. The guild immediately notified its members to prepare funds for purchase upon receiving the reply.</p>

<p>Chen Guohua, also known as Sufei, from Zhapu, is 30 years old this year. After graduating from the Sino-French School at the age of 19, he joined the French-owned tram company as a ticket writer. Later, because of his serious work, he was promoted to ticket inspector No. 6, and then promoted to inspector No. 5 last year. He is one of the most popular Chinese employees in the company. At 2:10 PM on the 25th of this month, when Chen was performing his duties on public bus No. 849 of Route 21 from the terminal station of Dapuqiao, three strong men wearing blue cloth clothes followed him on board. When the bus reached the intersection of Jin Shenfu Road and Avenue See Yaume, one of them pulled out a pistol and fired two shots at Chen's head, both hitting vital parts. Chen immediately fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The three thugs immediately opened the car door and fled. When they reached the intersection of Jin Shenfu Road and Rue Lafayette, the shooter fired a shot at Chinese police officer No. 1101 who was operating the traffic lights, hitting passerby Xu Wangshi and Ji Jinfu, a boy living at No. 88 Jin Shenfu Road. The Sikh police officer Salaev heard the sound and chased after them, firing his gun and hitting the shooter, who fell to the ground and was captured. He then rushed to send the victim to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but he died.</p>
<p>After detaining the criminal, the police, based on the confession of the injured and captured criminal Luo Rucheng, arrested the principal offender Lin Shengxiang (also known as Wu Laoer, 29 years old, from Nanjing, previously a driver and dismissed), Bian Jintang (27 years old, from Yancheng, previously a ticket seller), Lü Tiancheng (32 years old, from Jiangbei, a ticket seller), and suspects Xu Chengchang (29 years old, from Yangzhou, a police officer No. 962), Zhou Yuntian (41 years old, from Yancheng, a ticket seller No. 172), Luo Zhifa (40 years old, from Yangzhou, a ticket seller), Yuan Jinshan (36 years old, from Yancheng, a ticket seller), Guo Shu'an (35 years old, from Gaoyou, a ticket seller No. 271), Wang Yaozhong (34 years old, from Yancheng, a ticket seller No. 21), Yu Tiansong (36 years old, from Yancheng, a ticket seller No. 54), Li Rongwen (30 years old, from Jiangbei, a ticket seller), Li Heshang (30 years old, from Jiangbei, a ticket seller No. 201), Kuai Dahui (32 years old, from Yancheng, a ticket seller), Wu Xiangyao (24 years old, from Fulin, a ticket seller No. 306), Xu Baoming (31 years old, from Fulin, a ticket seller), Yao Yunlong (36 years old, from Yancheng, a ticket seller), Wang Hongchang (35 years old, from Jiangbei, a ticket seller), Dong Anxiang (32 years old, from Jiangbei, a ticket seller), Zhang Qingsheng (42 years old, from Yancheng, a ticket seller), Shen Shaoyu (35 years old, from Jiangbei, a ticket seller), Chen Hongtao (34 years old, from Gaoyou, a ticket seller), Hu Wandong (31 years old, from Jiangbei, a ticket seller), Yan Pu (35 years old, from Yangzhou, a ticket seller), Gu Yuewen (46 years old, from Jiangbei, a ticket seller), Luo Xiweng (30 years old, from Jiangbei, a ticket seller), Sun Bingliang (29 years old, from Yancheng, a ticket seller), Zhang Wanjun (28 years old, from Yancheng, a ticket seller), etc., and arrested them all. However, the principal offenders, ticket sellers No. 185 and No. 297, had already fled after hearing the news. The details have been recorded in the newspapers. Yesterday afternoon, the criminals were escorted to the Criminal Division 1 of the Special No. 2 Court for interrogation. The police lawyer Fei Xizhen requested a postponement of two weeks because the administrative authorities had not completed the investigation.</p>
<p>The reason for killing Chen was, according to the handling detective Yan Jinwen's report, that the case occurred because the dismissed ticket seller Bian Jintang had the idea and ticket seller No. 304 Lü Tiancheng helped to carry it out. That morning, Bian and others first discussed the plan of action in Room 13 of the Daji Hotel on Bellows Road and decided that Luo Rusheng would use the gun (Luo is currently being treated in Guangci Hospital due to injuries and did not appear in court), and Lin Shengxiang and Bian Jintang would keep watch. As for the pistol used in the murder, it was robbed from police officer Xu Chengchang No. 255 on Avenue Paul Beau. However, Xu knew that the gun was lost but did not report it, so he is also suspected of a crime. As for Zhou Yuntian, he is the guarantor of the fugitive principal offender ticket seller No. 297 and was also arrested. The rest of the defendants were arrested based on the signature book of each defendant participating in the conspiracy found on Lü Tiancheng. It was also heard that each defendant contributed five yuan to hire a murderer. Lin Shengxiang confessed that that morning, Luo and Bian and I first waited for the deceased on the Bund, but it was inconvenient because there were too many people and we could not start. Then we followed him to Dapuqiao but still did not start. It was not until in front of No. 118 Jin Shenfu Road that Luo used the gun to attack. There were a total of twelve bullets in the pistol. Two shots were fired at that time. As for the motive for killing Chen, it was because Chen was too loyal to the company and often made reports, causing us to be fined lightly or dismissed heavily. Bian Jintang then confessed that in August last year, I was reported by Chen to the company and my business was dismissed. My family had no way to make a living and I was very angry with Chen, so I discussed it with ticket seller No. 304 Lü Tiancheng. Lü also had the same hatred, so he asked Luo to kill Chen. The rest of the confession was the same as Lin's. According to Lü Tiancheng's confession, Bian is my brother. Chen did do too much and always looked for our shortcomings and reported them to the company, so I always had to be fined a dozen yuan from my salary. I really intended to get rid of him. The rest of the confession was evasive. According to police officer Xu Chengchang's confession, my pistol was robbed on April 17th. I didn't know that they robbed it for murder. The rest of the defendants all confessed that they had no hatred with the deceased, and the five yuan involved in the case of ticket seller No. 304 was said to be a rotating credit association fee. Although they all agreed to join the association, they all did not pay, so they all knew nothing about the killing of Chen Guohua. Judge Zhang Minsheng verified the words and immediately ordered the case to be postponed until the 12th of next month for further trial. All the defendants were remanded in custody.</p>

<p>Cao Baoxian, a young owner of Yixing Gunny Sack Store at No. 123 Mei Bai Ge Road, is 20 years old this year. He had previously fallen in love with Cheng Aizhen, a woman from Hangzhou (19 years old this year). Both sides were willing to grow old together, and the relationship began at the Dragon Palace Hotel on Eight Immortals Bridge. They then rented No. 52 Yu Kang Lane on Rue Pichon to live together, with the date of the wedding scheduled. Unexpectedly, Cao Baokun left home on the pretext of returning home in less than half a month and never returned. On March 20th of this year, he officially married Lu Huanqi, a woman from Jiashan, at the Mountain View Garden on Sima Road. Since being abandoned, Cheng Aizhen has become pregnant and is unwilling to accept it. She will file a lawsuit against Cao and Lu for disrupting the family. Cao, in order to preemptively strike, had Lu Huanqi file a lawsuit in court against Cheng Aizhen for disrupting the marriage. The Special No. 2 Court approved the petition and, the day before yesterday (26th), Judge Yuan opened the second hearing. The plaintiff and her lawyer were present in court, and the defendant Cheng Aizhen hired lawyer Yin Tinghua to defend her. Lawyer Yin began by stating that Cao Baokun and Cheng Aizhen's adultery had been admitted by both parties as an indisputable fact. However, the period of adultery was before Cao Baokun's marriage to Lu Huanqi. Since Lu Huanqi obtained the status of wife, Cao Baokun and Cheng Aizhen have not continued to commit adultery. Therefore, Lu Huanqi has no right to sue in this case. He asked the court to rule that it would not be accepted. Judge Yuan verified the words and immediately ordered that it not be accepted. As for the case in which Cheng Aizhen's mother separately sued Cao Baokun for disrupting the family, it is scheduled to be heard on July 3rd.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Feng Bingnan's Memorial to His Mother's Birthday (Part 2): Elucidates the Essence of the Eight Virtues and Returns to Filial Piety.

<p>As children, we should all fulfill filial piety. This is a natural and eternal truth since ancient times. What exactly is filial piety? The sages and wise men of ancient and modern times have fully expounded the principles of filial piety, and those who diligently practice filial piety have been recorded throughout our history. However, the concept of human morality evolves with the times, so I have a little supplement to my understanding of filial piety. As children, because we want to repay the hard work and nurturing grace of our parents, we fulfill filial piety. This is the saying from ancient times and an unshakable principle for all ages. This is considered from the children's own perspective. If we consider it from the parents' perspective, then parents are willing to have their children practice filial piety. Parents spend boundless effort and energy to raise a child to adulthood, and they often sacrifice their own lives for their children, partially sacrificing their own health and sacrificing their own happiness. The mental effort required is more and harder than a great artist to complete the greatest artwork. Children who cannot fulfill filial piety are not worthy of being born. An artist so focuses on his work that the purpose is to have his work succeed. The psychology of parents' expectations for their children is the same, but even more earnest. Childbirth, raising children, and nurturing them to adulthood is the most complicated, most difficult, most painful, most patient, and most responsible thing to do. Especially for mothers, the pain during pregnancy and childbirth, so those who do not give up pain and give birth to children do so because there is an expectation later. If children do not fulfill filial piety, then this expectation of parents becomes empty, and the parents will feel that the suffering they have endured is not worthwhile and meaningless, not only for themselves, but also for society and for humanity, it is not worthwhile and meaningless. Therefore, everyone wants to avoid pain and all burdens and does not give birth to children. In recent years, some people have advocated birth control. Part of the reason is for the economic environment, and part of the reason is for the health of the mother, but in fact, many who should be mothers avoid the pain of childbirth and the trouble of raising children. This trend is most prevalent in the United States. According to statistics, if the increase rate of birth control in the United States continues like this, it is feared that there will be no more births in sixty years. If all human beings have such a tendency, then the entire human race will inevitably move towards extinction. (One or two countries are trying their best to promote birth, such as Germany and Italy. Regardless of the purpose, they are not losing sight of the opportunity in this regard.) They know that manpower is the first thing to survive in the world, so they strongly encourage birth. Mencius of our country also said, "There are three unfilial acts, and having no descendants is the greatest." Our country has respected this saying for thousands of years, so to this day, our nation is prosperous. The size of the population is the greatest among all countries, which shows that the ancient sages were ultimately foresighted. From this point of view, children who fulfill filial piety make parents happy to have children, and humanity will not become extinct. If we do not promote filial piety, then even if there are children, they are only enough to harm society. Some may ask, why do animals not know filial piety, but animals can maintain their posterity and not become extinct? This is because animals have the instinct of sexual desire but do not have the knowledge of birth control. Although humans have the instinct of sexual desire, they also have the knowledge of birth control at the same time. Therefore, animals will not drive their own race to extinction, but if humans do not promote filial piety, then the race will be in danger of extinction. Therefore, filial piety is not only related to one's own conscience and ability but is simply related to the survival of the entire nation and all of humanity. It is not only a matter of ethical morality but simply a very real social problem, a national problem, an ethnic problem, and a big problem for all humanity.</p>
<h3 id="e67">An Opium Addict Plots Robbery and Murder: Conspires to Wound a Fellow Opium Smoker, Feigning a Trip to Hanzhuang for Pleasure, Inside He Raises an Axe to Commit Robbery, The Culprit is Apprehended, the Injured Taken to Hospital <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>A case of attempted robbery and murder occurred in the French Concession some ten days ago. Because the police department was in the process of apprehending the culprit, it was not announced. The culprit was apprehended the day before yesterday. Here is the beginning and end of the case, as investigated by the reporter of the She Wen She: Chen Dejing, a local man, 36 years old, residing at No. 8, Lane 125, Zhao Zhu Jiao Road, French Concession, is relatively wealthy, with a wife and a concubine. However, Chen is an opium addict, a fact unknown to his wife and concubine. Chen frequently indulged in opium at Yan Zhenshan’s (33 years old), a Yangzhou native, opium den on the third floor of No. 8, Yuqing Lane, Balizhao Bridge Street.</p>
<p>There he became acquainted with Song Deping (34 years old), a local man nicknamed "Little Uncle," who shared his interests. Chen, being wealthy, wore diamond rings and luxurious clothes, and was lavishly generous. This aroused Song's greed, leading him to plot murder. On the 13th, he purchased a sharp axe from a second-hand stall on Ningbo Road in the French Concession and hid it in a trash can in Ningfuli, behind the Slaughterhouse Company on Clark Road. Without raising suspicion, Chen claimed to Chen that in some Han Zhuang in Ningfuli, a new beauty had arrived, named Aibao, from Suzhou.</p>
<p>He claimed that every smile and gesture of hers was charming, and suggested that they go for a pleasurable visit. Chen, feeling bored, readily agreed. It was about 8:00 PM. After dinner at a certain restaurant near the Great World, Song pretended to knock on a door to inquire about Aibao, but found no one. He feigned disappointment and returned with Chen. Unexpectedly, when they reached the trash can where Song had hidden the axe, Song had an evil thought. He told Chen, "We are trapped in this dark life, and our strength is waning day by day. I don't know who is stronger, you or me. Why don't we compare our strength by trying to move a large piece of cement from the ground?" Chen, satiated with opium and wine, readily agreed. He bent over, intending to lift the large cement block.</p>
<p>Seeing Chen fall for the trick, Song quickly took the axe out of the trash can and struck Chen's head twice. Chen, caught off guard, was wounded and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. Song, thinking he was dead, robbed Chen of two gold and diamond rings from his finger and seventy dollars in cash. He abandoned the axe and fled without a trace. However, Chen's injuries were not fatal. He had only fainted. After half an hour, he woke up and cried for help. Neighbors and guards heard him and investigated. They immediately reported to the police station and summoned an ambulance to take Chen to Guangci Hospital for treatment. However, due to excessive blood loss, he was unable to speak for a time, making it difficult to ascertain the details of the case.</p>
<p>Some days ago, Chen's condition improved slightly, and he narrated the above events. The police station dispatched detectives to strictly apprehend Song. Finally, around noon on the 27th, detectives Qin Youyu, Shen Jinshu, Zhang Dongcheng, Wang Baolin, and others, discovered Song's whereabouts. They rushed to Room 8 of the Lao De Tai Hotel at No. 152, Balizhao Bridge Street, arrested Song, and brought him to the police station. Song confessed to the robbery and attempted murder. He also confessed that he had pawned the gold ring at Zhenhe Silver Shop on恺自迩 Road, and sold the diamond ring to Cai Yongshou, who does redemption work at No. 25, Clark Road. The police station is currently detaining Song for investigation because the victim's injuries have not healed.</p>

Group B has eight teams: Zhongyi, Tongren, Shangxing, Xihua, Moore, Nanyang, and Paramount B, using a single round-robin system.

However, due to the wet ground after the rain, it is still questionable whether the match can be played.</p>

<p>Changde One Win, One Loss</p>
<p>Last night, the China Vocational Table Tennis Team, at the invitation of the Changde Team, played at the China Vocational Table Tennis Room. The competition was fierce. As a result, Changde won by a score of 6 to 1. At that time, veteran table tennis player Chen Linsheng sat in the rear for China Vocational. He was old but vigorous, winning three to zero against Zhou Jialiang, the captain of the Changde team. The demeanor of the old general was truly well-deserved. The match results are listed below:</p>
<p>(Changde) (China Vocational)</p>
<p>(1) Wu Guoguang Shu Shaoyuan 3-1</p>
<p>(2) Shao Yutang Xia Guansheng 3-1</p>
<p>(3) Jun Changxing Feng Chu 3-1</p>
<p>(4) Du Yunbang Sha Zizhao 3-2</p>
<p>(5) Tong Chunhua Shao Lizhang 3-0</p>
<p>(6) Shao Yugang Wu Daqin 3-1</p>
<p>(7) Zhou Jialiang Chen Linsheng 0-3</p>
<p>It is reported that Changde played against Da Samsung in the afternoon of the same day. Due to the absence of strong player Tong Chunhua and the lack of practice by main player Shao Yugang due to examinations, and with the help of well-known players Jiang Zongdi and Cheng Zhifang, Da Samsung complemented each other. As a result, Da Samsung was defeated by a score of 11 to 3. It is also reported that the Changde team accepted the invitation of the strong Shanghai team Xinya on Sunday last week and met at the Xinya table tennis room. As a result, the Changde team won by a score of 13 to 3. Among them, Shao Changxing won four consecutive games, and Shao Yugang's victory over Li Shaoguang was the most exciting. It is reported that Xinya will meet again with an elite team on the morning of the 28th.</p>

<p>Japanese shops and households all like to use kerosene to light up at night, so kerosene sales are very large on the market; however, local officials often worry that this oil is easy to be careless with. Previously, they issued an edict to residents that all sellers who have ten boxes of kerosene should sell two boxes in the shop and store eight boxes in the official's office. After selling out, they can go to the official's office to pick them up, to prevent unforeseen circumstances. After this edict was issued, it was inevitably difficult for both buyers and sellers, so few followed the edict. Today, someone has come up with a new method of adding medicinal water to the oil to light it. Not only can it not catch fire, but the light is even better than kerosene. As a result, many people have switched to using it.</p>

<p>A snake beggar named Jia lives in a dilapidated house in Weng's Courtyard, Su Yuan. Every year in April and May, he goes out to catch snakes at sunrise, eating, playing with, or selling them. He has been doing this for more than ten years and knows all kinds of snakes. At the beginning of the month, he was poking around in the grass with a pole when he saw a snake that looked like a gecko, more than two feet long, with four legs in the front and back, and mottled all over with golden red color. He thought it was strange and put it in his bag. When he went to bed in the evening, the room was winding up and down with countless snakes, raising their heads and wagging their tails, ready to pounce. All the beggars were uneasy and advised him to release the four-legged snake. Jia agreed, and the snakes then gradually dispersed. Some say that this four-legged snake is the Snake King. Is it true? Who knows?</p>

<h3 id="e84">We Are Saving Wild Children <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— A Friend of Wild Children</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Yao Jingxing's "Save the Wild Children," I venture to report some of my humble experiences in rescuing wild children. For more than ten years, whenever I have seen men, women, old, and young begging on the streets, I have always felt endless sadness. I have often discussed with many friends how to actively help this group of door-to-door beggars. However, we talked more than we acted. After the outbreak of the war, I came into contact with a new group dedicated to child care and was able to suggest rescuing beggar children. Although we have not completely solved the problem of begging in the city, we have opened up a small path for wild children (beggar children and garbage collectors), which can guide them to the land of happiness and well-being.</p>
<p>Currently, there are more than seventy children advancing on this path. Among them, some have been begging for two or three years; some for two or three months; and some have not begged, but their families have suffered tragic destruction. We have organized a home, a school, and a workshop for them, a three-in-one place.</p>
<p>We tell them that life is precious and that they should not give up on themselves and live a wandering, lowly life. Now, these more than seventy children spend half the day studying and half the day learning a craft. Their faces have become quite full, and they stand tall with their chests puffed out. They can read, write, sing, draw, play chess, play ping pong, cook, wash clothes, mop the floor, clean windows, sew, and make shoes. They can stand side by side with the children of wealthy families without feeling inferior. They have forgotten the tragic scenes of the past. The younger ones jump and run around all day, sometimes clinging to their teachers, as if savoring the sweetness of a loving mother.</p>
<p>However, things often do not go as perfectly as we imagine. Occasionally, there are a few children with ingrained bad habits who do not cherish themselves and are unwilling to live a disciplined life in a group, preferring to wander the streets and alleys. When our劝导 is ineffective, in order to maintain the peace of life for the remaining children, we have to let them try the taste of wandering again, until they realize and come back. We are as excited as seeing a prodigal son return. Some, after several escapes, become particularly settled in their studies and work when they return.</p>
<p>Seeing their smiling faces, focused on their books or the work in their hands, a whirlpool of joy fills our hearts at the same time.</p>
<p>We look forward to all well-intentioned guidance and assistance. Our location is at 37A, Route Pelly.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Historical Site: Compiègne <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— Jiequan</p>
<p>Since Germany and France signed the peace treaty in the Forest of Compiègne, the area will become a historical site that will never be erased. The name Compiègne does not only refer to the forest. Near the forest is also the city of Compiègne, which is also a quaint city.</p>
<p>The city of Compiègne is located downstream from the confluence of the Aisne and Oise rivers. The local population is about 15,000, mostly engaged in shipbuilding, weaving ropes, and manufacturing water pipes. The local commerce is quite developed, especially in linen, wooden shoes, timber, coal, and agricultural products. The hats and agricultural products produced there, such as wheat flour and barley, are also well-known.</p>
<p>There are many historical sites in the city. Tourists visiting the area can see the remains of many ancient castles. Among them is a high tower built in the 12th century, most of which has now collapsed. This dangerous tower stands on the bank of the Oise River, and the locals call it the "Tower of Joan of Arc." In addition, there is the Church of Saint Anthony, half of which was built in the 12th century and half in the 16th century. The nearby Church of Saint Jacques is also an antique from the 12th century. This church houses many precious ancient documents. In the center of Compiègne, there is also a statue of Joan of Arc by the famous sculptor Le Roy. There is also a university in the city. Compiègne has been a place for meetings of politicians and bishops since ancient times. Joan of Arc was captured here on May 14, 1430. The Royal Palace of Compiègne is also a famous site. King Louis XVI of France and Marie Antoinette, as well as Napoleon I and Marie Louise of Austria, held their wedding ceremonies in this palace. It is unknown whether the above-mentioned many historical sites will remain intact after this war.</p>
<p>The Forest of Compiègne is located south of the city of Compiègne, between the Oise River, the Aisne River, and the city of Paris. The forest covers an area of more than 140 square kilometers, with a perimeter of about 94 kilometers. There are many historical sites in the forest, including more than forty sites with prehistoric ruins. The ancient Frankish emperors often rode and hunted in the forest. At the end of the last European war, representatives of France and Germany signed a peace treaty in a dining car in the forest. After Germany's victory this time, Hitler, in order to avenge the humiliation, also forced the French to sign a peace treaty in the same dining car at the same location. However, after the treaty was signed, he transported the old, broken car back to Berlin for safekeeping as a souvenir, but he did not move the Forest of Compiègne to Berlin as well!</p>

<p>— Li Xizhi</p>
<p>The university education I have received is a special gift from society. The diploma I receive only indicates that I have tried my best to study, and there is no special merit. I must be humble, because I have no reason to be proud.</p>
<p>I have received a gift from society, and I must return that gift to society in its entirety. This is my duty and my responsibility. Most of my brothers and sisters in society do not have the blessing of receiving a university education. I must sympathize with them, help them, and support them.</p>
<p>Today I leave school life, but I do not leave the life of learning. I want to learn in life, and I want to live in learning. I want to pursue the light in the world, and I want to promote the truth in the universe. I will never let down the education I have received.</p>
<p>The education I have received is only a preparatory stage for entering society and becoming a person. In addition to being a person, I must never forget the country that is in danger, because without the country, there would be no me. I will do my best to use what I have learned to contribute to my motherland. I want to lead my motherland on the path of rejuvenation, because I want to make this world a better world.</p>

<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Two: "A Page of History!"</p>
<p>Jinmei continued: "Old Mao looked around the room and suggested calling Manager Lu first to inform him. Old Master Li also agreed. So I called his residence. Manager Lu had not yet returned home. I said it would be better to notify Miss Wang's good friend, Miss Jiang Anna. But she was not at the Happy Dance Hall either. We wanted to find someone who could make a decision and then figure out what to do. Because Old Master Li rarely came and was like a guest. He was not very familiar with Miss Wang's situation, so he was unwilling to offer any suggestions. Later, we discussed it and sent Old Mao out to find Manager Lu and Miss Jiang. It wasn't until dawn that Old Mao accompanied Miss Jiang here. Then, Manager Lu finished his mahjong game at the Yangtze Hotel and returned home. When he heard the news, he called here first to inquire. I told him that Miss Wang had been shot. He said that he would report it to the police station. But he himself has not come here yet." After Jinmei finished speaking, she glanced at her dead mistress, then fixed her gaze on the white carpet with blue flowers, as if waiting for other questions.</p>
<p>Hawthorne asked again: "What did Miss Jiang do when she got here?"</p>
<p>"When she saw Miss Wang like that, her eyes were full of tears. It was clear that she was very sad. She asked us about what had happened and said that this matter was very strange and that we must investigate it thoroughly."</p>
<p>"Ah, she said it was very strange? Did she give any indication?"</p>
<p>Jinmei's eyes seemed to glance at Hawthorne and Jinshou. She hesitated for a moment before turning her head and answering:</p>
<p>"No, she only said that she was going to hire a detective named Huo to investigate this matter..."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou suddenly stopped writing and interjected: "This is Mr. Hawthorne, the nationally renowned great detective..."</p>
<p>Hawthorne frowned and waved his hand, stopping Ni Jinshou's unnecessary introduction. (29)</p>
<h3 id="e89">Essay: The Attitude of Criticism <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Li Shaozhong</p>
<p>A person's talent and knowledge are ultimately limited. So we have a common saying that "three cobblers are better than one Zhuge Liang."</p>
<p>From individual actions to national political measures, correct, reasonable, and constructive criticism—whether it be the advice of loyal officials or public opinion—is needed to urge and correct, so that the bad and imperfect places can be improved and reformed, becoming good and perfect. From this, we can say that "criticism" is one of the main driving forces of "progress."</p>
<p>However, there are some people who nowadays whose specialty in "criticism" lies in "arbitrarily denying everything and obliterating ethics."</p>
<p>For some "critics" who misuse the formula "X is not equal to Y, therefore it is equal to Z," we can only say "what more can be said?" Of course, we are not saying that one must study ethics meticulously and recite "Three Hundred Cases" before one can write "criticism." However, if one clings to the "new logic" of "this thing is not a horse, then it is a dog" and proudly writes thousands of words, discussing right and wrong, we cannot help but feel a cold sweat for many "white-haired scholars" of ethics in the world.</p>
<p>"Criticism" is one of the driving forces of "progress," but what we need is an attitude of criticism that is:</p>
<p>First, a calm mind, focusing on reason, not acting on emotion, and even less using "public office for private gain."</p>
<p>Second, not forced, not distorted, and not contrary to "logic."</p>
<p>Third, one must do some research on the object of criticism oneself. After understanding the problem clearly, then write to express your opinion. Don't blindly crash around like "a blind man riding a blind horse." As for some friends who themselves are only "half-knowing" about a problem and then make grand pronouncements, people will certainly "dare not accept" their views.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Congratulations on the Birth of Golden Star Company <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Peiran</p>
<p>Golden Star Film Company has announced its establishment. The company's establishment advertisement in the newspaper mentioned their film production policy, saying: "The selection of subjects must be prudent; the production technology must be refined." This attitude is very good and worthy of excitement among those who care about Chinese cinema.</p>
<p>Since Shanghai became an isolated island, the cultural world has always stood at its post, working diligently, and will not fail to meet the expectations of society; comparatively speaking, if we are unwilling to protect our shortcomings, then the film industry cannot but be said to be the most backward link. According to the recent situation, it is not only out of touch with the cultural world but also completely compromised with the environment.</p>
<p>The establishment of Golden Star Company at this time, and with such a sincere and earnest attitude, is something that we should be happy about. Here, the writer would like to, as a movie lover, place some expectations on it:</p>
<p>First, we all know that the environment in Shanghai is difficult; we certainly do not hope for works of慷慨激昂; but we are also resolutely unwilling to listen to靡靡之音. At the very least, film works should not be divorced from reality and should encourage the audience's spirit to move upward. This is regarding the content.</p>
<p>Second, now is a time of material hardship. Production certainly needs to be as fast as possible, and material resources certainly need to be saved as much as possible, but to the extent that it does not damage the work itself. Crude and shoddy production, writing a script in one day and filming a movie in ten days, is unacceptable. The production attitude should be serious. This is regarding the form.</p>
<p>Naturally, this is also an expectation of the entire film industry, but our expectations for the newborn Golden Star are especially urgent! I heard that Mr. Zhou Jianyun is one of the main persons in charge of Golden Star. With Mr. Zhou's past history of struggle, he should be able to guarantee the realization of our expectations.</p>
<p>At the beginning of Golden Star's birth, I sincerely wish it progress and effort, and an unlimited future!</p>

<p>— Ahan</p>
<p>Miss Sun Jinglu, a basic member of the China Travel troupe, is now a rising star in the drama troupe. Besides the sister flowers Tang Ruoqing and Ruoying, her position in the Xuan Palace is high enough. Indeed, with her crisp and fluent vernacular and lively movements, no one would believe that she is a lovely young woman of seventeen! In fact, although she is young, she has been following China Travel for many years, performing in Hong Kong, Hankou, and other places, and her stage experience is enough to make her acting skills well-trained.</p>
<p>Half a month ago, just when China Travel was performing "Ah Q," she suddenly suffered from a throat ailment, so that she could not go on stage. The role of Sister-in-law Seven was temporarily replaced by Wu Chunzhen. At the same time, her illness was quite serious for a time, even turning into the danger of scarlet fever. Later, thanks to the treatment of both Chinese and Western doctors, she was able to escape danger and gradually recover her health. However, her spirit of engaging in drama is very high, so in "Heaven and Earth Net," she played the main role of Nara.</p>
<p>However, her body has not fully recovered after all, so after several days of performance, her foot suddenly became swollen, telling her that she had no choice but to rest quietly and not perform for the time being. So, starting yesterday, the role of Nara in the play was replaced by Lin Na. It is estimated that in the near future, she can only watch the play with a sick foot.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Revisiting Old Matters: Talking About "The Good Earth" <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Qiao</p>
<p>Cha Ruilong, the Chinese strongman who is famous in the film world for starring in the Shandong Swordsman, has many anecdotes in his life that are worth recording. What is particularly praised by people are two things: one is the world-renowned film "The Good Earth." At the beginning of the filming, the role of the protagonist had already been decided to be played by a Chinese person. However, due to various restrictions, such as the need for a height of six feet and a weight of 164 pounds, after several searches, no one was suitable. Later, through the introduction of Ms. Jiang Yiping, Cha was introduced to Mr. Wen Lishimin, the China consultant of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which was filming the film. After the meeting, he was considered satisfactory. The reason is that Cha's height is not only five feet eleven inches and zero, and his weight is exactly 164 pounds, which is in line with its regulations, and his physique is strong, like copper tendons and iron bones, so he is really a rare talent. The factory was also quite interested and planned to ask him to play the lead role in "The Good Earth" for a price of 200,000 national currency. Cha was worried that the film might contain insults to China. For the sake of prudence, he discussed it with his friend Tian Han and decided to request to read the script first. However, the factory insisted that it was not possible. Cha became more suspicious of the content of the film, which might contain insults to the Chinese people, so he resolutely sacrificed the reward of 200,000 yuan and declined to star in it. (Note: Paul Muni was later used to star in this film.) The second thing is that recently, a major film company in Hong Kong specially invited Cha to star in the sound film The Story of a Wandering Swordsman. At first, Cha had the intention because this film was similar to his personality. Later, he learned that the film was actually a variation of Burning of the Red Lotus Temple, which had long been banned by the National Government, so he also politely declined it. Cha's enthusiasm for patriotism can be seen from this. Cha has devoted himself to martial arts for many years. The new techniques he has invented are a new type of martial art with practical effects, which is easier to achieve results than Taijiquan.</p>
<p>Brief News: The Fourth American Navy has been holding naval services and concerts at the Grand Theatre every Sunday morning at 10 o'clock. It is heard that the concert this Sunday (the 30th) has invited harmonica player Wang Qinglong to lead the China Harmonica Society to perform. The program is exceptionally wonderful.

<p>The China Film Studio does not want to be hindered by Japanese bombing and hinder its work. Therefore, it has recently installed a generator in an air-raid shelter on the outskirts of Chongqing, so that it can continue to work even when the city stops supplying electricity during air raids. Recently, Japanese planes come to bomb every day. The films "A Year" and "Japanese Spies" continue to work under this special equipment.</p>
