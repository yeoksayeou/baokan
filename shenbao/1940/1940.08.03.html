<p>社評</p>
<h3>一般社會之保健問題</h3>
<p>上海居民之死亡率無準確數字可資統計。目所見，耳所聞：路斃日必數十起，街頭病丐所在皆是；貧苦階層之呻吟床第，不獲醫藥而奄奄待死者，以及一般社會之死於庸醫僞藥者，不知凡幾也；於是而讀隔昨報載鐵肺人三十誕辰之電訉，能不慨歎乎？美人史耐特以鐵肺人著稱，前於一九三六年三月間，遊歷來華，在北平突患麻痺症，呼吸瀕絕，乃養之於鐵肺中，須臾不能離；日昨報載電訊，此人已能離其鐵肺，出而度其三十弧誕，且其夫人並將於下月分娩矣。夫托性命於鐵肺，生死懸於呼吸間，而得不死；非特不死，且逐漸恢復其原有機能，而能生育，是誠醫藥進步後之奇績也。</p>
<p>雖然，當今醫藥誠進步，但其進步亦因人而顯；無史耐特之財富，則爲癱爲瘓，不幸而死，墓木已拱；幸而帶病延年，所受所歷，人間地獄不啻也；而史耐特不特自華返美，自美赴法，優遊自如；在紐約則嘗參觀世界博覽會，在德則於鐵肺中裝迥光鏡，觀綱球比賽，身雖麻痺，得以醫治固無間，而心靈自在，故死症亦可以不死。若不得其醫，不得其藥，得其醫而不得其藥，得其藥而不得其醫，或至於無藥無醫，雖不死之症而亦至於死矣。是則人之生死，豈由自然之支配，亦繫於人力之匡救矣。</p>
<p>返觀今日上海社會中之病人固何如，不望有如史耐特治療調養之萬一，而掙扎於病榻之中，徬徨於生死之途，蓋有不知若干人也。此中右不得良醫良藥而至於不起者；有誤於庸醫庸藥而至於死者；亦有爲求醫求藥，求之無方，而促其死者，是皆非死於病，而死於無錢無醫無藥。人死於無錢無醫無藥，謂之不得其死也可，謂之社會之病態也亦可。</p>
<p>蓋今日可爲貧病之救星者，各善堂原有之施診而已；以言施診、規模粗備者寥寥六七所，此中若仁濟善堂，就診者每日約有七八百號，納號金二角，並給以藥一劑，確乎其爲貧病造福匪淺。此在一善堂之施診範圍內觀之，爲數已鉅；而在茫茫人海困於疾厄中者比較之，恐亦甚微。以是可知即並此施診之惠亦有不得遍沾者矣。且各善堂施診，大都以國醫國藥爲限，西藥雖有而不著；於是欲求西醫治療者，當求之較有公立性質之醫院，而其擁擠，其怱忙，其神態，病家欲期診斷明確，則不得不求於私家醫生。私家醫生之稱貧病免費者，寥若晨星；有之，則甚有所不「免」也者焉。於是求診一二次，已至無力再醫之地步，是惟有憑一己之體力以與病魔抗，幸而勝則生，不幸而敗則死，如此慘劇，爲一般人所慣見慣聞而不遑慨歎矣。</p>
<p>夫誰尸其咎，補救亦確乎甚難。既未能多言建設，只能就現狀以冀其改善。固知每一事業之見有成效　財　兩者俱不可缺；有其財，無其才，則徒然浪費，無裨於事業；有其才，無其財，則孜孜矻吃，而其績不著。故欲解決貧病之困苦，第一，仍不得不望大衆共發同情心，有力者扶助無力者，有錢者扶助無錢者。第二，施醫給藥、美名也。母貪其名、應有其實，醫治應求其精審，藥材務求其眞實，濫竽充數，以僞亂眞，非以救人，乃以殺人，是求生反得其死，爲善適以作惡也。第三，既願爲貧病而服務，自應無怨無恚、務誠務敬，要知病家心理，什九皆煩懣，稍示體恤，則安慰良多；不假詞色，則刺激殊深；此不得不望於醫生護士之輩，知所悲憫也。</p>
<p>然此僅爲貧病計也。若薪工階級，除所服務之機關定有職工疾病醫藥辦法、自爲職工所應享之權利，此外，既有恒業，義不容仰賴於慈善，自惟有善自爲計。雖然，薪給有限，劇病可虞；即使積儲不薄，亦復久病可虞；以一人之力而負一家重擔，以固定收入而遭不測病魔；此則薪工階級雖極自愛而輒無以自全者也。然則何以爲計？日各自爲計，必有不足；臨時求佛，必無靈應；要在以集體之力量，作周密之組織，必先分擔醫藥設備於康健之時，然後無虞治療費用於疾苦之日；此有效之自助也，恒久之合作也，合理且合算之方法也，此外更無善計。糾集多人，衆擎易舉，斯爲主體：以此羣力，聘任有學術，有熱忱，有道德之醫家，周詳璧畫，設「保健會」。保健會者，現代之社會組織，絕非市醫招徠長期主顧之歛錢營業，侔利法門也。</p>
<h3>日本接近軸心國　對美裂痕益加深　關島有重行設防趨勢　美國對日停運汽油三十五萬桶</h3>

<p>華盛頓　加州民主黨衆議員依薩克昨晚吿合衆社記者稱、日本最近所宣布之外交政策、或將刺激美國國會而使之贊助關島設防之提議、依氏係眾院外交委員會職員、渠以為日本此次在東京重行宣布內外政策、足使美國國會及人民感到、『對日採取綏靖政策乃無用之舉』渠稱、國會此後當對日採取强硬之態度、國會已有在今秋或明年初加强關島防禦之趨勢、依氏並稱、『歐洲遇有事變、日本每在東方開始行動、日本以爲英國一旦失敗、吾人卽將被逼自太平洋撤退、惟余不相信吾人至少在目前有此意向、』共和黨眾議員費許稱，渠信羅斯福政權所採取之干涉遠東運動、係逼使現時日本改變政策之中因、』渠稱、『余久巳相信政府如繼續到處採取反日姿態、結果將驅使日本接近德義或至接近蘇聯、今日遠東情形殊堪扼腕、惟吾人自應擔負一部份之責任、』（二日合眾社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　此間昨日計算、羅斯福總統對飛機汽油出口之禁令、已將自美國各地預備運至日本之汽油三十五萬桶加以停止、（二日合衆社電）</p>
<h3>日外相闡釋新閣外交方針　放棄「討好各方」政策準備採取外交攻勢</h3>
<p>香港　東京電、松岡因其聲明或嫌抽象不易了解、復於一日下午、招待新聞記者有所解釋、其大意謂日本將採取外交攻勢、放葉其「討好各方一之政策、過去內閣所採取之政策、對解決「中國事件」有利之各國、則與之合作、對阻撓日本在華行動之各國、則捨棄之、此種政策原亦合理、但新內閣在目前環境下、將首先發動盡量多覓友邦、俾能貫澈日本之外交政策、世界各國中、固有欲與日本合作者、但亦有與此相反者、凡拒絕與日本合作之國家、日本決不擬與之握手言歡卽八面玲瓏之外交、徹底清算、關於「不介入」方針既決暫維持自無可言者、確立大東亞共榮圈、當以日「滿」華爲其樞軸、處理中國事變、仍爲當前最緊要事、尚無變史、而大東亞將包括南洋、亦不待言、其目標在包含日「滿」華荷印越南及其他完成自給自足之經濟單位、以確立東亞安定因素、總之、關於新內閣之外交方針、尚未至更進一步說明之時期、如時期到達、自當具體發表云云、觀其談話可知所謂（不介入）方針、漸有改變之趨勢、但此或不免含有爲威脅英美之作用也（二日電）</p>
<p>倫敦　每日電聞今日社論、謂日本新政府所發表之政策文吿及日外相松岡閘明此政策之言論、既屬措詞在暴、且亦詞意欠明、日本今所佈吿之外交政策其大部份在實質上與前外相有田所宣佈者相同、松岡並未作進一步之說明、不過謂法屬越南與荷屬東印度皆在日本目的之範圍內耳、松岡之所增者厥爲刺激之表示、凡拒不與日本現行計劃合作之外國、日本決不與之握手、日本在對華作戰三年中、內閣之更迭其速令人迷惘、而性質則相同、每一新閣就職、輒持有以較前閣更嚴峻的行動、結束戰爭之程序、故今日松岡與近衛皆以完全解決中國局勢爲其主要目的、日本目前雖將不與閒歐事、但將利用國際局勢之變動、發仇對英美之言詞、而注目於荷屬東印度、以進取其目的、日政府竟被迫暴露此種態度、良可扼腕、今料日本軍閥對於美國拒絕再以廢鐵與油或飛機油供給之必將咆哮不平、但彼等陷於此種困難、實咎由自取、不能怨及他人也、日本軍閥主義之野心施諸中國國家權益與世界一般幸福者、共受害之甚、除英國外、莫美國若、日本政治家必須明瞭彼等不能期望依賴美國之資源、延長對華戰爭中之慘暴行爲、屈服中國之日、較諸三年以前未見稍近、此爲明白之事實、日本軍力消耗於中國各省者至巨、其重要戰爭原料今已剝奪凈盡、無從取給、對荷屬東印度所作之威脅、無補大局、東亞之繁榮固爲日本之眞正利益、但欲達到此目的、唯有取和平之道而已、（一日路透電）</p>

<h3>日又逮捕二英僑　英使進行交涉　日外省發言人表示　拒絕英方任何抗議</h3>
<p>倫敦　今日據此間官方消息、又有英僑二人在朝鮮被日當局所捕、一爲英敎會牧師却特威爾、另一名桑福特、主日英大使克萊琪、對於此事已向日方提出交涉、關於二人所犯罪狀、此間毫無所聞、計目前在日被拘禁央僑共爲九人、（二日路透電）</p>
<p>東京　日外務省發言人頻麼彌吉郎頃稱、英國方面日本逮捕涉有間諜嫌疑英人事件所提之任何抗議、日本政府均將予以拒絕、發言人指陳、此案完全爲一內政問題、不涉外國抗議之範圍、須磨此項言論、係對新聞記者之詢問而發、蓋各記者曾詢以日本政府、是否對任何英國關於日方逮捕英人之抗議、均將置之不理云云、發言人繼稱、逮捕英人乃爲維持日本內國和平秩序所必需、係依照日本法律而行、職是之故、此一案件、應完全列入內政方面、但須磨承認此事具有若干牠方面之因素、嗣又吾認此舉係日本改變外交政策之結果、該發言人指陳、就根本上言之、日本國策實無絕對之改變、惟爲適應國際新情勢起見、於外交政策上容或有所改變（二日合衆社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　此間可靠方面昨晚得悉、日本釋放被捕英人六名、而加彼等以間諜未遂之罪名、殊不能使英國政府滿意、除非日本憲兵將現仍被拘之英人七名迅速予以釋放、則英國或將採取特殊行動、此間回憶日本未予警吿而邋將英人十三名拘捕、已使英人感到甚深刻之印象、日本保留被釋六人之公文、表示日本或將仍對彼起訴、此舉益使英人不滿、頃據權威界探悉、駐東京英大使克萊琪已向日本政府提出抗議、要求說明逮捕事件、最近日本軍部情報明白宣言英國爲「敵對強國」、此間負責方面意見、相信日本蓄意排斥在華之英國及其他外國權益、然對於日本重行考慮與英國大規模戰爭一節、尚表示懷疑、其意或謂、英國亦强烈認識於遠東局勢開展最後階段中、日本將有要求香港之可能、此聞一般觀察家相信、香港並非足以久守之地、然渠等分柝稱、日本倘對該地施以攻擊、必遭受軍事抵抗、此間之堅强信心、以爲日本對星洲之任何行動、必將認識英國較爲强大之地位、（二日合衆電）</p>

<h3>蘇聯两院聯席會議　一致通過外交政策　維持中立決不參加戰爭　波羅的海三國代表列席</h3>
<p>莫斯科　聯邦院及民族院今日舉行聯席會議、情况異常熱烈、晚間七時兩院議昌卽已到齊、此外並到期達漢諾夫份子、莫斯科工廠工人、紅軍人員、塲中無空座擁擠不堪、七時正、斯達林·莫洛託夫·伏羅希洛夫·加里寗·卡昂諾維區·密高揚·柴特諾夫·克魯斯赤夫·培里亞·馬冷哥·丁木生哥、以及最高議會兩院院長副院長入塲、來賓一致起立歡呼、凡數分鐘之久、祝賀斯達林及其同志、</p>
<p>聯邦院院長安杜耶夫宣佈開會、並稱立陶宛愛沙尼亞及拉脫維亞·貝布兩區全權委會代表均在塲、此時、全塲報以熱烈歡呼、安氏並代表蘇聯最高議會向該全權代表致賀、旋大會開始討論議程第一項、莫洛託夫當卽起立報吿、而全塲亦一致起立、對蘇聯政府首腦歡呼、莫氏報吿凡一小時、聽衆每一分鐘均注意報吿內容、對蘇聯和平政策之勝利、均表示滿意、當莫氏宜佈解決二十二年來蘇羅糾紛、收回貝布兩區以及波海三國家成立蘇維埃政權等項時、羣衆復報以歡呼、在結論中、莫洛託夫引證斯達林之言曰、「吾人應時在動員狀態下、並準備應付任何軍事襲擊、俾敵人之一切狡計均無從實施」、莫氏言畢、羣衆予以更熱烈之歡呼、</p>

<h3>莫洛托夫外交報告</h3>
<p>莫斯科　蘇聯人民委員會委員長及人民外交委員會委長莫洛托夫、在聯邦院及民族院聯席會議中報吿政府外交政策、當莫氏起立致詞時、蘇聯最高議員一致起立、向莫氏及各民族領袖斯達林致敬、歡呼聲震動全塲、莫氏演詞原文如左、</p>
<p>「各位同志及議員、自上屆大會舉行後、迄今已四月矣、在此時期中、歐洲方面曾發生極重要之事件、德國之軍事動作由挪威·丹麥·比利士·荷蘭而展及法境、於是歐戰乃益趨擴大、六月十日、義大利加入德方、向英法宜戰、至此歐洲强國第四大國遂捲入戰禍、自春季以還、歐戰已因挪丹比荷事件、繼續發展、而法方潰敗之速、尤爲本人所欲申述者、在一個月或六星期中、德軍非特擊破法方之抵抗力、且已强迫法國簽訂停戰協定、根據該項協定、法國犬部份（包括巴黎）均在德軍佔領下、</p>
<p>法國仍未獲得和平</p>
<p>法國現雖已獲得停戰、但仍未獲得和平、關於和平條件、迄今未能探悉、對付德義之協約國現已祇剩英國一國、英當局巳決定在美國援助下繼續作戰、法國已充分表現在戰時之弱點、關於法國被擊敗之原因、無庸詳細申述、總之、法國之敗、非僅由於軍事準備之不充足、重要原因厥爲法國統治階級過份輕視蘇聯在歐洲事件之力量、過去數月之事實、已證明法國潰敗更重要之原因、法當局未能與民衆聯繫一氣、彼等非特未以民衆爲主要力量、且將酷愛自由之法國民衆置於不重要地位、此點實爲法國衰弱最嚴重之因素、法國民衆現擬補償戰後之創傷、但此種任務、絕非易事、良以恢復邦國、非陳舊方法所能臻效也、</p>
<p>德國未逹主要目的</p>
<p>德國在戰爭中雖已獲得極大之成就、但尚未達到其主要目的、易言之、卽在德方所企求之條件下結束戰爭、</p>
<p>七月十九日德元首復向英國作和平建議、但據吾人所知、英方已拒絕該項建議、英政府且認該建議爲要求英國投降、表示苟不獲得勝利、決不停止作戰、同時英方並揚言將與昔日同盟法國斷絕關係、</p>
<p>此點表示英國不願放棄其散佈各處之殖民地、目前英幽雖因法國戰敗及義大利參戰而更陷於不利地位、但仍將爲世界霜權一戰、</p>
<p>歐戰第一年卽將結束、但全部戰事之結束、則仍遙遙無期、吾人現已屆德義及英美激戰之前夕、雖然此種種事實均未使蘇聯變更英外交政策、爲遵從和平及中立政策計、蘇聯決不加入戰爭、</p>
<p>絕對遵守德蘇協定</p>
<p>德蘇關係因一年前簽訂協定結果已發生重要轉變、菩政府絕對遵守該項協定、當蘇聯在西方實施政策時、並未與德發生糾紛、此實得力於蘇德協定之締結、同時該協定完成後、德國已不復有東顧之憂、最近歐局之變化、非特未减弱德蘇不侵犯公的之力量、且已證明該公的之重要性、邇來國外報紙允其是英方報紙、屢次推測蘇德不和之可能性、且以德國力量擴大一點向吾人恫嚇、實則此種謠言與恫嚇、已由吾人與德國一笑置之、吾人頃特鄭重言明蘇德之友好關係、完全基於兩國之共同利益而絕非偶然之過渡辦法、</p>
<p>對義關係亦已改進</p>
<p>最近吾人與義大利之關係亦已改進、吾人與義方交換意見結果、證明確有在外交政策上獲得諒解之可能性、同時吾人並預料兩國貿易將有發展、</p>
<p>蘇英關係並無變化</p>
<p>至於蘇英關係最近並無變化、吾人認爲英國屢次向吾人採取仇視行動結果、已使兩國關係無從順利發展、雖然英國遺派克里浦斯爲駐蘇大使、確係企圖與吾人改進關係、</p>
<p>蘇聯西境逹多瑙河</p>
<p>吾人外交政策之勝利、已使我國領土更爲擴展、關於此點、本人現擬申述之、查貝布兩區合併蘇聯、詳情已於六月廿八日發表、無庸贅述、本人所送交羅公使之牒文、包括建議兩項、（一）貝薩拉比亞歸還蘇聯、（二）北布柯維納移交蘇聯、結果、羅政府接受建議、於是二十二年之糾紛卽吿解決、貝布兩省居民大部份均爲烏克蘭及莫爾達維人、彼等已自羅馬尼亞貴族、地主及資本家手中獲得解放、而開始享受新生活、彼等內心之愉快、不言可知、查貝薩拉比亞面積四萬四千五百方公里、人口三百二十萬、北布柯維納面積六千公里、人口五十萬、自該兩區歸併蘇聯後、蘇聯領土業已大爲增加、結果、蘇聯邊境已展及西部、抵達多瑙河、按多瑙河爲歐洲最大及重要商業河道之一、此次事件之解決、極受蘇聯民衆之歡迎、同時吾人與羅馬尼亞之關係、此後自應順利發展、</p>
<p>波羅的海三國問題</p>
<p>本人現繼續申述吾人與立陶宛·拉得維亞·愛沙尼亞之關係、吾人與該三國所締結之互助公的旣未有成就、於是蘇聯與波海國家之關係最近遂發生重要轉變、查上項公約、由於统治者之反對、並未使蘇聯與該三國接近、</p>
<p>在簽訂互助公的後、波海三國家非特未與蘇聯接近、且秘密加緊向蘇聯從事仇視活動、而以所謂波羅的小協商國爲工具、按波羅的小協約國原祗包括拉愛兩國、但於去年末、立陶宛亦加人該項軍事同盟、對付蘇聯、此點證明該三國小資本主義統治者未能忠實遵守互助公的、相反的、彼等竟加緊從事反蘇工作、關於此方面之證據、蘇聯所獲極多、際此國際局勢下、此種行爲實無法予以容忍、因此、蘇聯政府乃不得不要求三國政府改組、並遺派紅軍至各該國、吾國政府採取此項步驟之結果、諸君諒巳洞悉、</p>
<p>三國親蘇政府成立後、其重要工作厥爲國會大選、七月間波海三國家各地舉行大選、結果證明三國小資本統治階級僅代表少數剝削民衆者、而未代表全體民意、依據直接及秘密投票法選出之三國國會已發表對一般政治問題之意見、同時立·愛·拉三國民衆、亦一致擁護並雙助設立蘇維埃政權、並將三國易爲蘇維埃社會主義共和邦、至此、蘇聯與三國之關係乃置於新的基礎上、該三國歸併蘇聯後、經濟文化均可獲得發展、而本身力量及安全亦得以鞏固、在另一方面、蘇聯力量亦因該三國之併入大爲增加、</p>
<p>波海國家併入蘇聯後、蘇聯人口大爲增加、計拉脫　亞一百九十五萬人、愛沙尼亞一百十二萬人、立陶宛二百八十八萬人、另加貝布兩區、蘇聯人口共已增加一千萬人、如吾人再加上烏克蘭之一千三百萬人、蘇聯在過去一年中已增加人口二千三百萬人、按該部份人口在一九二○年時、原係屬於蘇聯、但由西方帝國主義强國利用蘇聯薄弱之軍事力量强行奪去、目前此部份人口巳重新歸還蘇聯、至此蘇聯全部人口已達一萬萬九千三百萬、一九三九年及一九四〇年之增加數、尚不在內、</p>
<p>蘇聯獲致不凍港口</p>
<p>在另一方面、蘇聯邊境巳展及波羅的沿海岸、此點極關重要、同時吾人現巳獲得吾人所亟需要之不結冰港口、允重要者、願爲蘇聯係以和平手段達到目的、蘇聯與波海國家及其布區解決糾紛、完全得力於各該國民衆之擁護、關於在各新共和邦各項經濟及政治建設工作、其責任應由蘇聯政府負之、</p>
<p>蘇芬和約順利實施</p>
<p>在上屆大會中、本人會報吿蘇芬和約、自該的簽訂後、迄今巳逾四月、該的業已順利實施、此外兩國並已締結貿易協定、將來經濟關係之發展、正未可限量、蘇聯建議解除愛蘭島武裝、亦由芬方予以接受、蘇聯現更在該處設立領館、</p>
<p>將來蘇芬關係是否能進一步改善、全視芬方本身之努力如何、苟芬蘭統治方面若干份子不中止彼等加害親蘇人員之非法活動、則蘇芬關係必受打擊、</p>
<p>對瑞發展經濟關係</p>
<p>吾人與斯干的那維亞國家（挪威與瑞典）之關係、完全繫於該方面之現行局勢、目前挪威地位特殊、未能遽下斷語、至於瑞典、有一點值得注意、卽雙方均願發展貿易及經濟關係、關於此點、雙方正在進行談判、本人深盼談判結果、卽能成立裨益雙方之協定、</p>
<p>巴爾幹方面之外交</p>
<p>關於巴爾幹方面、吾人巳與南斯拉夫設立外交關係、以往兩國外交關係未能設立、固非蘇聯之咎、但此次關係之建立、係由南斯拉夫所建議、而由蘇聯予以接受、本人深盼蘇南關係亦能逐漸改進、吾人與保加利亞之關係已恢復常態、蘇布關係之進一步改善、前途已無障碍、</p>
<p>對土關係並無變動</p>
<p>吾人與土耳其之關係並無變動、最近德方白皮書發表結果、已發現土耳其方面若干令人不快之活動、駐土法大使雖有解釋但仍未能更變該項文件之內容、査在四月初、蘇聯政府卽通知土方蘇當局決不能容忍下項事實、四月初曾有來自土耳其之飛機一架飛越煤油廠林立之巴土密區、最初土方對該機來自土境一點、完全否認、但最後土方允許採取步　防止同樣事件之發生、自德方文件發表後、該機究屬何方面、不言可喻、而各人向土政府所提出之抗議、亦在情理之中、</p>
<p>加嚴監視伊朗態度</p>
<p>至於伊朗、並無重要事件發生、但亦有無可容忍之事實、三月末、在巴庫方面有飛機兩架來自伊朗、伊朗政府對此雖巳否認、但德方白皮書所載、巳有充分之解釋、吾人認爲此種飛機活動、必使吾人與磷邦之關係更趨複雜、由於此種飛機活動結果、吾人以後將在南部邊境增强監視力量、</p>
<p>對日關係可能改進</p>
<p>關於日本最近關係已開始形成正常性質、去年在哈爾欣河發生衝突區之確切劃界問題、雙方已於六月九日成立協定、此點極爲重要、蓋此事之延不解決、已使蘇日及蒙滿關係之調整、發生阻碍也、在數日內、雙方所組成之劃界混合委員會將開始工作、就大體而言、日方似有改善關係之傾向、苟雙方均能認識去除障碍之必要、則蘇日關係之改進、並非不可能、雖然、日本新政府之所謂「新政治機構」計劃、不甚明瞭、日政府南進之口號已引起日本主要方面之注意、良以該方面對歐洲之變動極感興趣也、雖然、在許多方面、彼等之政治抱食尚未明瞭、關於蘇日關係、亦有同樣情形、</p>
<p>蘇美關係不願發表</p>
<p>關於蘇美關係、吾人不願有所發表、蓋兩國間之情形、依然乏善可吿也、據謂美國若干方面對於蘇聯在波羅的海國家所獲得之外交勝利、表示不滿、事實上、吾人對此並不關切、良以吾人實施工作、並無需此輩紳士之合作也、雖然、最近吾國國家銀行曾向波海三國購買現金、而美當局竟非法禁止出口、吾方對此必提出嚴重抗議、關於此事、吾人祗可向英美政府提及彼等非法行爲之重大責任、至於吾人與偉大中國之關係、自兩國簽訂不侵犯公約後、一切素極友好、中國現正爲生存而戰、</p>
<p>殖民地問題尖銳化</p>
<p>吾人與其他谷國關係、本人不願贅述、茲僅在國際變化、作一簡略之申述、自德軍獲得勝利後、歐局已有變動、但迅速結束戰事之期、尚未來臨、德國自獲得勝利後、國力已大爲增强、在另一方面、英國繼續作戰、已感困難、至於法國、自被擊敗後、現仍遭遇嚴重之危機、此種力量强弱之轉變、非特在歐洲有重大之反響、卽世界其他各地亦將蒙受影響、</p>
<p>除法國外、被擊敗之國家尚有荷比兩國、荷蘭擁有巨大之殖民地、但其實力巳不足保衛其殖民地、於是重分殖民地之問題、乃更趨尖銳化、</p>
<p>帝國主義之慾望、非特日本卽美國亦具有之、在美國方面、若干人均以「關切」作彼等帝國主義計劃之烟幕、彼等擬以「西半球全部」歸爲已有、至於各國在美國大陸附近之殖民地、美國亦擬據而有之、凡此種種、均足擴大戰爭、使其成爲帝國主義世界大戰、</p>
<p>增强國力有備無患</p>
<p>在此種情形下、蘇聯不得不鞏固其內外地位、吾人現已實施每日八小時每星期七天工作制度、俾吾人得以執行增强國力之任務、整頓紀律同時並提高生產力量、</p>
<p>吾人雖已獲得相當成就、但吾人並不以此自滿、爲進一步獲得勝利起見、吾人應牢記斯達林之言、「吾人應隨時在動員狀態下、並準備對付任何武力進攻、俾敵人之一切狡計均無從實施、</p>
<p>「苟吾人牢記此言、則吾人決不致爲他人所逞、且將爲蘇聯獲得更光榮的勝利、」（二日塔期電）</p>
<h3>英美方面評　莫氏演說</h3>
<p>倫敦　此間負責人士對於蘇外長莫洛托夫在蘇聯最高議會開幕時所發演說之某數點、巳有批評、謂果如莫氏所稱、克利斯浦爵士之被任為駐蘇大使、係由於改善英蘇關係之願望所促成、故當蘇聯表示願作貿易之談判時、英方卽任克氏爲駐蘇大使、賦有賡續貿易討論之全權、希望得蘇聯之合作、此項討論將可產生效果、並證明其爲改進一般關係之重要因素、惟鑒於莫氏所稱英帝國現正準備繼續戰事以獲世界霸權一語、英方殊有聲明英帝國之繼續作戰、實爲對抗世界霸權之必要、（二日路透電）</p>

<h3>世界最富麗的典當</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城旅居不久的外僑，都不免向阿根廷人問着，「那名叫Casa　De　Ventas的是什麼塲所，是不是百貨商店呢？」</p>
<p>阿根廷人對於這個問題眞是答不勝答。原來那所富麗堂皇的Oasa　De　Ventas是一所市立典當，表面看來，却像百貨商店。其實，它是一種新奇的商業，其總所和六處分所僱用職員逾一千一百人，營業以利民爲目的，貸款所收質物中，縫衣機達一萬具，鋼琴達二千五百具，可見其規模之大。它還貸款各城市，以助築路還債。一九三四年間貸予阿根廷京城市政府的借款，達二千一百萬披索，約合美金四，八三○·○〇〇元。</p>
<p>外國尋常的典當，都設在陋巷，無非一所汚穢的小房屋，櫉窗裏亂堆着舊錶等雜物，人們非至一籌莫展，決不願踏進典當門的。</p>
<p>在阿根廷京城却不然。那裏的典當是由市政府管理，市民出入典當，就像進銀行一樣，大模大樣，毫無愧色，它對貧困市民無不盡力服務。</p>
<p>這所典當設在市中心，是一幢精緻的五層樓新厦。質物未經贖回的，在拍賣前數天，公開陳列。櫥窗若干，成半圓形，其中布置整潔精雅。可與百貨公司相頡頏。</p>
<p>例如，一個櫉窗裝飾成餐室，便陳列着優美的桌椅，碗盞，繪畫，電鐘，下附小籤，註明號碼和最低標價。其他櫥窗，分陳各色無綫電機，皮貨，打字機和樂器，無不布置得寬敞悅目，有條不亂。</p>
<p>拍賣室中最有趣的人物是一種代辦。你若不能親自到塲購物，祇須付五分錢手續費，並付百分之二十的押櫃。拍賣時便有代辦替你出價，最多到你暗中預定價代的爲止，也許不滿你所指定的代價，便成交了。</p>
<p>顧客購貨，還有一種便利。假如你想買某種物品，而不見陳列着，只須留下你的姓名和電話號碼，等這物品有出售時，便會通知你。這種服務精神，對於質物者和買客，眞是兩全其美。買客隨心所欲購得物品，旣無不便，又不浪費時間。典當方面售出質物，所得利潤，扣去應得息金，將餘款交還質物原主。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城典當的熱鬧</p>
<p>這所典當轉角處，面臨小塲，是一所估價室，出入人們川流不息。阿根廷京城市民持物典質，司空見慣，他們可說是靠借債度日。無論購置衣履以至汽車，莫不分期付款。他們性好揮霍，於是不得不乞援於這所市立典當。</p>
<p>一般市民走進估價室，從容不迫，正像走進其他公共塲所一樣。估價室對質物者也像普通店舖對顧客一般的彬彬有禮，請他在小房間中候着，由職員將待質物件携進估價員。質物原主和估價員永不見面，以免勾通。估價旣畢，質物者得款離去，決不爭多嫌少，蓋深知所得押款，必較其他私人當舖爲多也。</p>
<p>這所典當收受任何種質物，貸款亦無限制。它曾收下鑽石一枚，押款十二萬披索之多（的合美金二萬七千六百元）。它又曾收下飛機一架，後來不得不以十元左右的代價賣去。結婚禮服典質的很多，但結婚戒指非到山窮水盡，不肯輕易典質。縫衣機典質的也很不少。這所典當爲節省堆積地位，及便利原主計，常准原主留着縫衣機應用。</p>
<p>這所典當常被人呼做阿根廷京城的藏衣室，因爲有些人典質衣服，祇是將其貯藏着而已。</p>
<p>有些人典物後，按期付息巳逾十年。曾有某婦典質鋼琴一具，巳歷二十五年之久，典當管理處便決定將它交還原主。典下的望遠鏡，不在少數，原來有些人賽馬輸了，星期一日質去望遠鏡，到星期六領得週薪，再去贖回，照常看跑馬去了。可是賽馬入迷的，並非個個能贖回質物。例如某洗衣婦曾將顧客托洗的襯衫質去，得款賽馬大負，顧容索衣時，竟出當票讓顧客自己贖取</p>
<p>惟這所典當職員都不准入跑馬塲。他們的薪給優厚，且有種種安居樂業的待遇。例如月薪不是一百零四元的，誕生一孩，便得津貼一百披索（的合美金二十三元）還另外贈送嬰孩的坐車衣衫。</p>
<p>這所典當自一八七八年成立以來，確能忠實展行其爲公衆服務的使命，今且積極從事慈善工作，每年將貧民所質的冬季衣服和毛毯，抽籤發還。一九三八年曾資助醫院建造肺病療養室和門診室，以利貧病。南美洲一帶人因稱之爲有良心的典當，實當之無愧。</p>

<p>又訊、泰縣因連日得雨後、河下稻數來源頗旺、二十四日稻價二十六元、已較前减低二三元、二十五日又因新稻上市、故拋售陳稻數目、亦較往日爲多、是以稻價大跌、現上稻每石二十五元、中稻二十四元、次稻二十三元、新稻出量尚佳、每石見價二十元、據陸陳業中人談、如各種糧食不再私運出境、仍有大跌之可能、</p>

<p>港電有所塞出</p>
<p>午後投機商依然猛吸、計進八月份美滙五元八四三七五、且聞荷蘭與有利對做八月份美滙緊至五元八一二五、後港電略出市面吿定、故投機商入美行等八月份美滙仍五元八四三七五、嗣投機家少數見貴吐售、計賣予華行八月份美滙回達五元八七五、晚收英金爲三辦士八一二五、美滙五元八四三七五、本月份與現貨價同、九月份英金三辦士七八一二五、美滙五元七八一二五、較上日英金期現各緊○六二五、美滙期現軟一二五與〇六一五</p>

<h3>美票暴漲</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、因法幣與英鎊商業新匯率業巳宣佈、以致烚赤暴漲、英美金鎊因亦各升三元、英金票需要不惡、價漲一元、美金一度高達十七元四角、但未幾即吿步落、一度回落至十六元八角二分、午後又高至十七元零五分、比上日軋漲三角八分、香港票需要尚殷、價漲一分、坎拿大票及菲列賓票亦均趨漲、日金票亦趨漲風、晚市高至一元二角七分、朝鮮票潛勢甚俏、晚市高至一元零九分半、</p>
<h3>為重訂商匯率　金市漲風再起</h3>
<p>昨日本市現金烚赤暗市、漲風東山再起、於混亂中價已盤出五千五百元大關外、緣因報載渝電、中央財部重訂中交兩行商業滙率、定法幣對英鎊價爲四便士半、本市人心受一時之刺激、外匯突緊、故將甫伏不久之買風、重被激起也、晨開卽升至五千四百八十元、時在外匯止緊回鬆時、小錢莊金號傾出、遂見在落、見五千四百三十元低價、不久外匯較緊、買風重吿熾烈、金號小錢莊散戶等復進、午刻盤出五千五百元外、下午某銀樓亦傾進、遂升見五千五百七十五元高價、不意因外滙聞有港電供給、突然止緊、多方傾售、曾銳落九十元、入五千五百元內、終隨外匯重見昂升、收市五千五百二上五元、計軋升一百二十元、全日交易四千餘兩、飾金升起十元、爲五百七十元、關金等、均平、</p>
<p>烚赤漲百念元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以報載重慶對商業滙兌率改縮、故雖美英匯兌吿長五分、人心則頗堅昂、開市竟橫跳七十五元、錢兌業進銀號十兩、爲五千四百八十元、詞因滙市緊後忽鬆、錢兌業銀號卽來競賣、未幾竟回落五十元、銀號出金號十兩、遜爲五千四百三十元、旋賣風稍挫、金號忽來吸納、頓又提升三十元、金號進銀號五十兩、爲五千四百六十元、奈此後某金號忽來猛塞、爲數不少、復被壓小至五千四百四十元、惟不久某錢兌業突來在吸、且斯時賣者减少、加之散戶亦見景跟進、一霎時卽衝出五千五百元大關、銀號互做十兩、升爲五千五百十五元、後以浮多獲利吐出、曾回入五千五百元關邊、惟終因某金號補空殊切、復見五千五百三十元高價、而收市爲五千五百二十元、午後開時景况頗佳、一跳二十元、金號進銀號二十兩、爲五千五百四十元、繼因金號及銀號扒進、續高三十五元、金號進銀號十兩、昂爲五千五百七十五元、旋某銀號突來撳價力賣、且金號證券幫等爭先求售、加之不久某錢兌業多頭大量出籠、竟一度逼入五千五百元大關、金號出證券幫十兩、浪爲五千四百八十五元、後以人心仍堅、低價買戶頗多、並賴某金號轉賣爲買、迨收市又漲達五千五百二十五元、結果比上日軋漲一百二十元、全天一百四十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金掛大十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸五百六十元、迨十一時三刻、掛高十元、此後則無變化、計大同行改懸五百七十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>絲茶　外銷停滯　本埠絲市上升</h3>
<p>邇來海外絲市、可謂呆鈍異常、橫濱現貨一三五○元、不動者巳十日於茲、遠期略有升况、較前日漲十一元、紐的市氣相同、數日來紐約交易所每日成交額僅四五成單而巳、市價方面、昨日則呈上升、計近期漲三分半、遠期漲四分半、本埠洋行英法行家沉寂如故、某方洋行續有吸購、輯里六號售開二五二五元、計較前漲五十元、成交額達近百担、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米新到近三萬包　米價一度上漲旋又回落</h3>
<p>洋米昨日又有大量到滬、計中通公司經理之英輪St．Vincent　Depul號由西貢接運來一萬六千二百五十一包、昨晨到滬停靠北京路外灘十五號碼頭起卸、預定昨晚夜工可卸竣、又怡和洋行利生輪、由海防運來六千零九十二包、香港裝來六百十七包、裕生輪亦由香港裝來一千九百零七包、兩輪於昨晨先後抵埠、停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、太古公司成都亦於昨午到滬、自香港裝來五千零十八包、停靠法租界本行碼頭起卸、計四輪裝米到滬、共計二萬九千八百八十五包之鉅、（祖）</p>
<p>現洋米市似已轉向盤旋之途、前兩日一漲一跌、昨又重演漲風、雖早市賣買尚承上日疲勢、後以內地幫護照關係、突又出手選採廉價之下身貨、至此一經活動、售方卽隨風轉舵、頃刻形勢帶緊、引得本在靜觀之一般實銷、相繼進取、而心思交易、隨機轉變、得風助浪、允爲活躍、於是市面際斯各方推動激盪不定之狀態下、愈覺濃馥、各貨行情、在喊聲逐節增高中、結果收盤已較前市回升一二元不等、計一號陳西貢又至五十六元半、新尖五十五元、然雖如此、但實銷並不見貪、內地客幫亦無暢化、加之存底擠塞、後到絡繹、未敢儘興收買、市又步落四五角、最後祗較好半元至一元、回籠路現原包在早市現米上漲之際、二號西貢又開至五十九元半、乃進戶不旺、反有趁高吐出、收市又自五十九元三四角小至五十九元、暹暹二號開價亦爲五十九元半、收市亦回小二角爲五十九元三角、總之市上存底充實、實銷不多、市面終難過份回好耳、回籠原包已開出二百噸、現米七千包、</p>
<p>國糯到貨旣久吿斷、而棧存日薄、不過前因洋糯相軋、脚地較軟、茲則洋糯迭經甩脫之後、底貨頓亦减稀、而銷路反見激增、致形成供求不勻之勢、物稀爲貴、遂緊俏異常、價騰二元左右、開金溧特元五十九元、常丹白元五十六七元、香港元五十八元半、决之五十六七元、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米到貨雖時不　、但以盤子高貴、較之洋米相距彌遠、致傳聞塲外暗盤交易僅一些零星胃口、售價因之難能與洋米並秀、堪稱定局、悉與前盤相仿云、</p>
<h3>日粉喊高　麥價亦漲</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨廠盤仍守十五元原價、本客均有零星點綴、市面脚地漸穩、查日廠粉迭經貶價後、頗引起一般貧賤者所垂注、連日麥價微高、走銷稍動、貨方頓時喊起、八月份鳳凰牌初開十四元、旋即升至十四元二角、九月份已達十四元五角、成交約計三千包、市面漲風頗熾、內地粉亦隨市而堅、聞雙獅牌亦售十四元五角、但無正式成交、</p>
<p>小麥　昨因內地蘇錫等處、產價已漲、日廠進胃似轉活躍、貨方心思頓堅、扳守不脫、昨日成交允稀、而市形巳暗升五六角、華廠放價暗收、日有二三千包收進、進價亦比前提高半元左右、</p>
<h3>證券　內債漲跌互見</h3>
<p>證券晤盤、昨市又稍轉疲軟交易亦因此减少、塲內人心仍甚堅定、多方陸續收買、並未停止、如二十號向收戊種昨仍始終收買、甲種需要較爲普遍、因已規定本月十日舉行第十次抽籤、此次抽籤爲二十八支、又較上次增加二支、中籤較爲容易、成本雖較鉅、其權利自亦較多、如松茂永康恒孚以及一般散戶對於甲種特別感覺興趣、以前大戶之收買者、絕未見其出脫、前途或有畸形的發展、塲內賣戶、信昌鴻大聯益同康中信均有賣出、而買戶亦不弱、故結果乙種尚好五分、餘則一致回小五分一角至二角半、成交總數共計的八十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交南洋兄弟烟草公司股百股、價爲十一元三角、</p>
<p>衆業公所本週之交易雖少、最後五分鐘之浮多了結仍屬難免、但多方吸收力甚强、收盤市况極端挺昂、橡皮股最爲生色、英楂華與蘭格志各有進展收盤價前者爲三十五元二五、後者則爲二十五元二五、怡和股竟日買氣甚佳、英聯股成交亦鉅、</p>
<p>倫敦一日（週四）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛脾行市、銀行股趨向疲落、計麥加利銀行股回跌一先令三便士、價爲六鎊十八先令九便士、滙豐銀行股各跌二鎊、英倫註冊股爲六十三鎊、香港註冊股爲六十六鎊、古拉客林傍橡皮股獨升一先令三便士、價爲十五先令、其餘均無變動、</p>
<h3>紗花　雙馬紗　一度出千元關</h3>
<p>紗市趨堅、且漲風稍起、此因財部宣佈法幣英鎊新滙率爲四便士半、人心一時衝動、買氣濃烈、二十支雙馬漲出千元關口、詎料實際交易依然暗淡無生色、同時某某多頭乘漲風時在暗中忽然出檔、以致檯面鬆懈、市盤又復回挫矣、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、因行盤緊縮、黃金漲高、致投機買風活躍、二十支雙馬開高盤價爲一千元、漲二十元、一時人氣熱烈、叫喊聲紊亂如蔴、做至一千○〇八元、豈料大戶多頭大量的出籠、同時滙票稍軟、於此籌碼鬆落、市價卽速回跌至九百九十元、收盤稍回上、查半日間成交統計一千八百包、行情二十支雙馬漲十四元、今日有棉紗一千八百三十五件運香港、茲將各幫口買去之額量分列如後</p>
<p>同行　一、四三五香港二六五</p>
<p>天津　一〇〇一統計一八〇〇</p>
<h3>棉花廠需不斷</h3>
<p>現棉交易雖無躉批發展、然廠方零星需要尚不斷、加之外匯改縮、致人心轉好、所以市面較爲堅挺一些、茲將現棉成交情形列左、</p>
<p>大中華二〇七·〇〇　鴻章進　一三三件</p>
<p>巴西棉二二六·〇〇　申二廠進三〇〇件</p>
<p>火草包一五一·〇〇　協愼進　一五五包</p>
<p>大中集二〇二·〇〇　承德進　一三三包</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、市况異常呆滯、各方俱抱觀望、華爾街方面亦靜寂殊深、結果收盤價格、較之上日跌落二三磅、印度棉市昨日停市、預測不動、</p>
<p>滬嗥外棉交易、昨日雖匯兌轉緊、然未能刺激人心、棉紗因實銷呆滯、因之棉花交易毫無、市上存底日見稀少、尤以長纖維為最、故大衆意見、棉市將有轉機也、</p>
<h3>油餅　豆餅回挫角許</h3>
<p>油餅因乏新刺激、致在本週內無甚變遷、惟豆餅一度昂挺、但去路未見廣泛、故潛勢尚少驚人、且昨市已盤挫角許、祗做開甡記餅七百片、價爲十一元一角、元隆餅一車、價爲十元另七角、生豆油漲跌互見、其範圍亦平常、因之大局不離徘徊、昨由廣幫香港內地本道等辦去膠州生油三百五十件、價爲六十三元、烟台生油五十件、價爲六十二元五角、及大連豆油一百四十桶、價爲九十二元五角、浦東豆油二十桶、價爲七十一元云、今日有豆子一千一百六十包、生油一千二百八十聽運香港、</p>
<h3>疋頭　布廠籌備復工</h3>
<p>布市近以客銷蟬聯、囤戶活動、而生產數量因布廠普遍停工减工之故、廠方存底漸稀、頗多積極籌備復工、新貨成本、將因原紗漲價而增高、故市氣頗露轉機象、昨白貨售盤、每疋　增二角半至五角、漂染各布亦漲五角左右、本街印染廠對於各項坯布需胃激增、批發號略辦粗布·漂染布計共六百餘件、閩帮辦色布·色斜·綫呢等三百餘件、粵港帮辦斜紋·色布等二百數十件、川滇帮裝貨、改道仰光、轉口添辦色布等貨一百餘件、三日疋頭出口、運香港一千件、運天津四十件、</p>
<p>東布　貨·細布·細斜以實銷及囤戶搜羅、售盤一致升勝、細布漲每疋一元至一元三角、細斜每疋漲五角至七角半、十二磅龍頭細布後市成交價爲三十元〇七角半、四君子嗶嘰每碼九角一分、天津帮採辦細布三百餘件、本街同業心思殊堅、進額允夥、</p>
<h3>秋冬呢羢仍堅</h3>
<p>呢羢市况、依然淸疲、其秋冬需銷之各貨、若馬褲呢·駝斯錦·單面花呢·套頭花呢·麥爾登·平厚呢·鞋呢占呢·寬緊駝羢·長毛絨·短毛羢·海律斯·男女色各　大衣呢之類、趨勢則均穩固、但交易遠不如前半月之夥、此由售價高至頂盤、各種物價續見下降之故也、</p>
<h3>糖市　二四粗白　廣幫續進千餘包</h3>
<p>昨日糖市因新滙率宣布、英美滙俱縮、人心轉佳、二四粗白外棧貨六十八元五角、六十八元八角、最後做至六十九元、升一元二角、轉口貨卽打單者五十二元二角、五十二元八角、五十三元、八月十五打單者六十四元、升一元、廣幫進胃仍健，再收一千餘包、太古B嘜七十三元荷赤八月十五日到船交貨者、仍爲五十六元五角、咋有糖四十四包自海口來、八百八十包香港來、</p>
<h3>海味　螟蜅步漲</h3>
<p>自浙閩沿海爲某方封鎖後、甬方所產螟蜅海蜇、來源吿絕、於是市價不絕上升、如蜇皮升至六十元、貨底將罄、蜇頭五十元、寗波螟蜅八十元、市貨已收完、本山貨升二三十碼、售過一百四十五元、昨叫一百五十元、</p>
<h3>煤炭　同得利塊上騰</h3>
<p>同得利白煤前週因　戶大批出籠、暗盤節節下降、日來本街銷路、漸露轉機、街客有意搜羅、貨主反不肯脫手、暫存觀望、市塲現貨、頓感缺乏、行盤立時上騰、計開同得利篩塊每噸一百八十元、統煤一百七十元、送到客家、行扛在內、</p>
<h3>藥材　薏仁去路活潑</h3>
<p>薏仁味甘爲暑季利濕之品、故斯時銷路頗形活潑、而允以色白無蛀爲上選、查市間中次擋居多、刻下上中者售七十元、决之六十五六元不一、查來源寥落、後市看緊、</p>

<h3>昨晨同一時間內　發生暴行案三起　白俄領袖梅思拉遭慘殺　義泰興經理沈錦洲被綁　環龍路上綁架未遂槍傷巡捕</h3>
<p>通來本埠綁架暗殺之案、層見迭出、昨日領事團正爲會議遏止政治性暴行、不料昨晨八時二十分甫陽路二零八號竟發生暴徒槍殺本埠白俄僑民委員會主席遠東著名白俄領袖梅思拉氏（Charles　Metzler）參案一起、當卽負傷、身死車中、同日上午八時五十分許愛文義路溫州路轉角、又發生一綁架案、被綁者爲義泰興煤球號經理沈錦洲、此外、昨晨八時許、環龍路上、有一寓客正圖登車出外辦事、被預候該處之暴徒、向其恐嚇、幸以機警得免、惟該處崗捕中彈受傷、查上述三案、幾發生於同一時間內、茲分述各情如次、</p>
<h3>南陽路血案　白俄領袖被殺</h3>
<p>本埠白俄僑民委員會主席遠東著名白俄領袖梅思拉Charles　Metzler、於昨晨八時二十分、由其私寓南陽路二〇八號愛文公寓二樓一七號房間下樓、步出門外、甫登其私用汽車（號碼四八一一）經梅氏僱用十六載之（紹興籍）汽車夫周振貴、正將開車之際</p>
<p>甫登汽車即遇暴徒</p>
<p>突有祥生汽車（號碼一七九七二）一輛、駛在前面、一穿白色紡綢衣褲之暴徒由車上躍下、拔出手槍、逕向車中梅氏開放兩響、當時汽車夫周振貴警惶失措、下車竄逃、須臾重返原處、見暴徒躍上前面之汽車、行將駛去、彼乃立卽駛車尾隨其後、直至小沙渡路口、路旁突然又有暴徒數名出現、以手槍恐嚇周振貴、向後駛回原處、</p>
<p>梅思拉氏遺影</p>
<p>胸中兩彈當即身死</p>
<p>該暴徒復向梅氏開放兩槍、然後紛紛逃去、結果、梅氏左胸中兩彈、血流如注、氣息奄奄、當時在該處目擊慘案發生之某外僑、立卽催促該汽車夫將其主人駛往大西路宏恩醫院求治、但梅氏於半途中已吿氣絕畢命、屍體已移往萬國殯儀館、據與梅氏同住一公寓之一外僑稱、該祥生汽車內似有暴徒四名、直接行兇者則僅一人、</p>
<p>本埠俄僑同深震憤</p>
<p>該暗殺慘案發生後、本埠全體俄僑、大爲震憤、蓋梅氏生前曾對於促進俄僑公益方面貢獻頗多、按梅氏生前、與日本領事官員聯絡極爲密切、態度頗爲親日、兩星期前、彼曾造訪日總領事三浦義秋、討論本埠俄僑之地位、並悉日總領事當時答應支持梅氏繼任俄僑委員會主席職、同時一月前僞市長傳筱庵、亦曾向梅氏予以同樣之保證、衆信該慘案發生後、本埠俄僑對於日方主辦之新俄僑團體、表示更爲冷淡、</p>
<p>電促梅妻返滬治喪</p>
<p>記者曾赴梅氏私寓、內中佈置、頗爲富麗、梅妻之姊及傭人數名留守、從彼等獲悉、梅妻於四日前赴日避暑、並作病後休養、現巳電吿該氏、並促其乘飛機返滬、料理乃夫喪事、梅氏年五十二歲、寓滬將近二十五載、在聖彼得堡大學專攻法科、畢業後肄業於帝俄東方語言學院、一九〇八年、被委爲帝俄駐蒙副領事、一九一二年升任爲駐平帝俄使館秘書、旋卽派滬任領事職、一九二三年帝俄駐滬領事館關閉後、梅氏卽在丹麥保險公司任職、服務八年之久、然後轉任美商美發保險公司高級職員、</p>
<h3>義泰興煤號經理　沈錦洲遭綁架</h3>
<p>愛文義路溫州路轉角、於昨晨八時五十分許、突發生綁票案、被綁者係本埠煤業巨頭義泰興煤號經理餘姚人沈錦洲、匪徒四人、躍登沈之五一八六號自備汽車、向西疾駛而遁、於中午十一時許、該號汽車在愛多亞路朱葆三路口發現、茲將各情探誌於後、</p>
<p>汽車代步</p>
<p>沈錦洲、現年五十三歲、浙江餘姚人、稅居於愛文義路二三九弄平和里三號獨家居住、沈爲新閘路一八四號義泰興煤號股東兼經理、並充中華煤球公司常務董事、置有福特汽車一輛、號碼爲五一八六號、用以代步、僱有汽車夫南通人顧阿毛、（年三十四歲）服役已逾年餘、</p>
<p>突遭綁架</p>
<p>咋晨一時五十分許、沈循例乘車、擬至新閘路一八四號義泰興煤號視事、然後赴麥根路三五二號廠中視察、不料汽車甫開出平和里朝東折入愛文義路溫州路轉角時、詛該處預伏匪徒四名、首由兩匪、一御白色中山裝、一衣派立司長衫、各出手槍、攔住汽車前進、威逼恫嚇、於是開啟車門、各匪蠭擁登車、兩匪跨入車廂、將肉票挾住、執槍在手、不得動彈、餘兩匪步入車頭前面、監住汽車夫顧阿毛、</p>
<p>汽車發現</p>
<p>道令向南經靜安寺路西行抵靜安寺路成都路口、始將阿毛驅下、由一匪駕駛、賡續西進、不知所終、事後由阿毛近寓、向家屬報吿主人被綁情形、及投報新閘捕房營救查緝，捕房據報、曾飭探捕馳往出事地點查勘、並將汽車夫顧阿毛帶入捕房盤詰其主被綁架群情、一面跴緝綁匪歸案究辦、直至下午一時許、沈之汽車在愛多亞路朱葆三路口發現、當帶回捕房，令沈宅先行具領、沈昨晨被架時、服白華絲紗長杉紡綢衫褲、頭戴草帽、足登布底緞鞋、</p>
<h3>環龍路上綁架未遂</h3>
<p>昨晨八時許、環龍路某號寓主、甫出門口、正將踏登其私人汽車時、突有暴徒四名、向其恐嚇、擬將彼綁去、傭人見狀、直前攔阻、暴徒一人、立欲拔槍開放、乃槍爲彈軋住、未能放出、該寓主見狀、驚惶過度、致暈倒於地、當時復有行人經過該處、遂奔吿附近華龍路及環龍路十字路口站崗之華捕一○五七號、該捕尚遲疑不決、斥該行人曰、「爾何以知彼輩帶有手槍」、言猶未已、暴徒聞聲、逕以手槍向該捕開放、彈中其背、暴徒等立卽紛紛逃去、臨行慌張、遺下手槍一支、隨後受傷警捕、立卽送往法捕房醫院、傷勢經過、尚屬良好、法捕房現正繼續調查該案、至於發生原因是否與政治有關、尚未能決定、</p>
<h3>英大使　電吿安抵威海衛</h3>
<p>英大使寇爾爵士、於上月三十日搭太古公司之湖南輪悄然離滬後、昨接電吿、業已安抵威海衛、會晤大使夫人、寇爾大使此行、係乘一星期之休假期日、在該地稍作勾留、純係私人旅行性質、幷無任何公務、</p>
<h3>領事團昨日開會　發表重要決議　致函工部局附若干建議　促令各國防軍密切合作</h3>
<p>由於租界內恐怖行動之猖獗、工部局總董凱自威氏、乃於上月廿二日、向領事團懇切呼籲、要求合作、加以戢止、旋經領袖領事希爾氏召集領團會議、加以討論、無如以日總領三浦之轉移日標、諉過於中國政府、致會議結果、未有確切決定、而定於昨日重開領團會議、續加討論、</p>
<p>門禁森嚴</p>
<p>昨日下午三時半、此項會議、在工部局會議室舉行、因其性質之重要、開會時門禁森嚴、謝絕記者之採訪、除各國領事外、局外人絕無旁聽餘地、會議秘密進行逹二小時半之久、內容嚴守秘密、</p>
<p>發表決議</p>
<p>惟於討論結果後、發表決議如下、「上海領事團認爲一切恐怖行動、有違人道與文明之主義、茲因鑒於此種行動在上海一地已發生極可悲之影響、本團對於恐怖行動、無論出於何種方式或由何人實施、均予以嚴重之譴責、並因鑒於上海一地之實際情形、故特促令工部局對於此間之情形、加以充分之攷慮、而竭力撲滅及遏止一切恐怖行　以保和平而維秩序」、</p>
<p>準備復函</p>
<p>據領袖領事希爾稱、領事團已在致區工部局、附以若干建議、並促令警務處與駐滬外國防軍、協力合作、但在開會之前、有記者訪問日總領三浦、三浦仍持其成見、謂租界內恐怖事件、全由所謂重慶分子所釀成云、三浦仍以此藉口、要挾領團會議、</p>
<h3>滬郵局長乍配林　昨晨返滬　對法租界檢郵　會與日員接洽</h3>
<p>上海郵政管理局法籍局長乍配林氏、自上月十六日由滬取道香港飛滇、旋以總局局長郭心崧氏因公在渝、隨卽由滇轉渝、報吿蘇浙皖贛四郵區狀况、對於上海一般郵務狀祝、均有所詳述、茲以滬地公務待理、兼程循滇越路經杳港乘怡和輪公司之裕生輪來滬、乍氏業於昨晨七時之十三分抵埠、卽返寓休息、下午二時後、又復蒞管理局作非正式會晤金旨謹一郎、接洽關於檢查法租界郵件之具體辦法</p>
<p>檢郵情形</p>
<p>新聲社記者咋向馬斯南路郵局探悉、該局對於日檢查員應行扣留可疑郵件之記錄簿等、早經準備就緒、據吿正式檢查、確巳開始、惟尚無郵件被扣耳、一切進駐形式、早已完成、該支局管理組組長黃寬華氏亦已報吿、局方並坦白承認、大概以後將逐步檢查矣、昨日檢查員以金局長臨時之通知、故未往馬斯南路郵局、聞係因乍局長到滬關係、</p>
<h3>南市鐵門全部開放　昨又盛傳　據稱滬西烟賭　同時遷往南市</h3>
<p>昨日外間盛傳毘連南市關閉已久之鐵門、有定於本月六日全部開放說、又傳因上述原因、滬西越界築路及曹家波各賭台土行等、將同時遷往南市營業、並已獲得僞偵緝隊一「自衛隊」「警察局」及日方之憲兵特務隊共同許可、蓋因租界當局對滬西警備嚴密、各賭台營業蕭條、早欲另謀出路、以南市仍多阻碍、故迄未實現、大光社記者昨以此事分向各方探詢、迄難予以證實、惟宴海弄等處房屋業已租賃一空、聞卽因充作賭台土行之用、證之南市各里弄露天賭台林立、故賭台遷往南市之傳說、難以吾認、</p>
<h3>倪瀾深　昨晚被架</h3>
<p>新聞報編輯倪瀾深、於昨晚十一時返家、當步入所居之法租界華成路愼餘里內時、突有身穿西服之男子二人、自後竄出、將倪君左右挾住、拽至弄外、納入一預停於弄口之第三四五九號黑牌汽車內、疾駛而去、時倪夫人以倪君偶攖微恙、正在煎藥、迨弄內乘凉者以目擊之情形見吿、始知肇事、乃卽投報捕房請查、</p>

<h3>財政部改訂　商業匯況率　英匯四便士半　中外均予擁戴</h3>
<p>財政部加強管理外匯後、准結匯出口貨物領取外匯差額、必需品之進口盡量供給外匯、今為獎勵土貨出口、限制非必需品進口起見、命令將中國交通兩銀行之「商業外匯率」掛牌、自舊時之七辦士改為四辨士半、除通告中中交三銀行及貿易委員會外、並電令銀錢業同業公會遵照辦理、而法幣之法定對英匯率、仍為一先令二辨士半、並未變更、外界不察、以為法幣跌價、是誤解中央扶助出口商、限制非必需品進口之一番用心也、</p>
<p>於進出口商均有利</p>
<p>中國交通兩銀行商業外匯率之掛牌、自八月一日起、已改為英匯四辨士半、新聲社記者昨向銀行界探悉、（一）土貨出口、凡政府統籌收購運銷之桐油·豬鬃·茶葉·礦產、以及結匯之蛋品·羽毛·腸衣·皮革·子仁·煙草·木材·蘭絲·皮毛·掊子·藥材·油蠟·棉產·苧蔴·等十四類、依照價結匯實際結清匯額後、得憑結算證件、向結匯銀行領取法價與中交掛牌價格之差額、其用意在使出口商領得此項匯價差額、可以補助運輸上之虧損、藉以鼓勵其輸出、且可獲得相等於黑市法匯之利益、如此則可減少逃匯、而收集中外匯之效、</p>
<p>申請法匯　繳平衡費</p>
<p>（二）洋行貨進口、凡進口商之進口貨物、不在禁止輸入之例、而為國內所必需者、得向外匯審核委員會申請購買外匯、但申衣人須繳納按法價與中交掛牌價格之差額平衡費、其意義如下、蓋自非必需品及奢侈品進口既已禁止、其必需品進口自應盡量供給、以減輕人民因匯市趨縮、而增高物價之負擔、並因以往所有進口物品、無論必需品非必需品及奢侈品、以示能顯示標準核給外匯、致均向黑市場中爭購外匯、使黑市匯價愈趨愈縮、今必需品既予供給外匯、而非必需品奢侈品又已禁止進口、則黑市匯價可望較為穩定、</p>
<p>法定匯率　並不變更</p>
<p>關於法定外匯、自經平準外匯基金管理委員會竭力穩定後、始終如前不變、中央銀行之法定外匯掛牌、為英匯一先令二辦士半、至銀行辦理結匯研需費用、今已改為政府負擔、原定商人向銀行請法匯價時、應繳外匯法價與銀行掛牌之差額百分之三限度內手續費、概准免予繳納、以往商人向銀行結匯、係照實售貨價證明書所填實售數額九成結算、現已改為八成結算、其貨物由西南各省輾轉　出、須經外國口岸所需外幣費用特多者、尚可減至七成結算、俾出口商得將大量貨物出口、藉以增加外匯收入、平衡國際收支、</p>
<p>使與黑市　相差無幾</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨再向外商銀行探悉、上海黑市外匯、前因中國政府限制供給法定外匯、以致一般無法申請法定外匯者、均向黑市購進外匯、同時投機者故意操縱、使黑市匯價劇烈變動、正當商人、受害匪淺、而中國交通兩銀行之「商業匯兌率」、掛牌英匯七便士美匯十三元六二五、中央銀行之法定匯兌率、掛牌英匯一先令二便士半美匯三十元、但與上海黑市匯兌率之相差仍距、所以實有抑低「商業匯兌率」之必要、使黑市場得以持久穩定、今中國政府之抑抵中交掛牌使與黑市場相差無幾、則此後黑市得不致再有猛縮劇變、</p>
<p>金融市場　一致擁戴</p>
<p>外商對政府之措置、均表擁戴、而此後法幣之外匯來源、因更定掛牌匯率之後、出口商所得既形增多、紛紛自願將匯票售給政府、則整個外匯之來源、自必益臻充沛、此項更定匯率之消息、前日本埠消息靈通方面、即已獲知、惟因明瞭此項更動、純係調整匯市之一種技術作用、整個匯市、實不受任何影響、昨日此訊公布以後、市百一時曾呈反應狀態、美匯略縮至五元八一二五、黃金曾漲至五千五百元外、惟大勢極穩定、至於股市場則經過至為平靜、</p>
<h3>荷皇家輪停駛　港緬開辦飛航　暫定每星期六飛行一次　海防貨運陷停頓狀態中</h3>
<p>自歐洲第二次大戰爆發後、地中海封鎖、非但歐洲航運、遭遇重大阻礙、卽行駛歐亞線各輸、航道變更、船期亦守秘密、故本市華文報紙、對於交戰國國籍航輪船期、已極少披露、至法意商輪業已停航、意輪康脫佛田號仍寄椗於黃浦江十六十七號浮筒、開行無期、上海至荷蘭東印度巴城·孟加錫·三賣壟及泗水之爪哇航線、為本市渣華郵船公司獨家行駛、有芝字輪十余艘、荷蘭亦被歐戰擲入漩渦、該公司各輪航期、亦秘而不宣、</p>

<p>攀登屋頂</p>
<p>逃逸、內有一盜、踰後圍牆竄去、巡捕爲免誤侈他人起見、並未開槍、惟審愼注視、至衆盜復避入該衖各屋宇、遂開始挨戶搜查、衆住戶顯感惶懼、不予援助、惟巡捕搜查不輟、終在四十七號見有一人、自稱係廚子者、引起巡長陶格賴斯之疑寶、陶氏乃退出、</p>
<p>吿諸巡長</p>
<p>白賴特等、而請白氏從嚴防範後、復入四十七號、始有住戶一人、指盥洗室向陶氏私語曰「强盜」、陶氏乃入室、逮捕冒稱廚子之匪、將加盤詰、時的午後一時許、「市警」若干到塲、問明情形、與公共租界巡捕會同查問、陶氏當將被捕一人、交予「市警」、賡續</p>

<p>計劃周密</p>
<p>唯靜安寺捕房接得宇林西報某外籍職員報警、迅速出動兜捕、始克阻止此刦案、盜黨行刦時、由婦人率領、該婦熟知四十一號被刦住戶之習慣及女傭之名、故率領盜黨前往、先呼女傭啟門、禁其聲張、然後進屋內、驅住戶入一室、而後持槍逼屋主之子、領入藏有大量現款之室、適望風盜見巡捕到塲、亟呼嘯一聲、衆盜乃四散　逃、</p>

<p>學習西語</p>
<p>左氏傳有之曰：「樂操土風，不忘舊也。」楚在春秋，名爲夷狄，實則同在華夏之中，而於應對之間，猶以不忘土音稱之爲君子，今乃取海外之語言文字，勤而習之，不亦異於鍾儀之所爲乎；然處今而泥古，非達人之見也。近來中外通商，航海梯山，無遠勿屆，昔之所爲重譯而來者，自今日視之，不啻戶牖之問，此而不能通其語言，習其文字，又何以聯中外之情而達華洋之性，此所以講求西字西語者，固有不敢從緩者矣。遠見者父恐一齊人之傳，不敵業楚人之咻，議使幼童出洋，專心學習，爲置之莊嶽之計，並可以熟悉其人情風土，以成有用之材，而儲異日之用，法不可謂不周，意不可謂不美也。惟中國之愛子，多以姑息爲事，世家大挨，斷不肯令其子弟出洋，故所遣之人，半係寒酸之子若弟，一經出洋，眼界一開，此正如久居窟室，忽至郊原，則天地爲之異色，又離中國已遠，禮義之化，有所不知，故於管理敎養，必須十分當心也。</p>

<h3>公雞　—紀念魯訊六十誕辰</h3>
<p>— 徐翊</p>
<p>今天是魯迅的六十歲誕辰紀念日，遙望着深陷在妖氛中的先生的墳墓，我們哀哭嗎？歎息嗎？抑是舉起高燈來慶祝我們的巨人的「陰壽」呢？</p>
<p>六十年前的今日，正當一隻罪惡的魔手擰住我們國家的時候，在一個僻鄕的角落裏，產生出了一隻雄糾糾的「公雞一，那就是我們的導師魯迅。</p>
<p>魯迅是一隻「公雞」，他站在幾萬萬的「懶猪」當中，每晨爲他們摧醒迷夢。然而「公雞」終於因着疲勞過度而死了，那末我們的「懶猪」是否也因着沒有了雞啼而致一睡不醒呢？</p>
<p>鐵的事實吿訴我們：「懶猪」們因着「公雞一數十年的報曉和現實的敎訓，已經習慣了什麽時候應該醒起，什麼時候應該工作了！他們不再貪吃懶做，也不再一睡不醒，他們變成了一羣忠實的耕牛，不，他們變成了一羣勇敢的吼獅！</p>
<p>可是對於這死去了的「公雞，我們應該作怎樣的紀念呢？我們決不哀哭，決不歎息，但我們也知道這還不是提燈掛彩慶祝的時候。我們要做的，是要學他苦幹的精神！</p>
<p>「我們要敢笑敢哭敢怒敢駡敢打，在這可詛咒的地方，擊退那可詛咒的時代！」</p>

<h3>英國人的家庭</h3>
<p>— 蔣彝自倫敦寄</p>
<p>在一個英國人家庭裏，普通祇住一夫一妻或者一兩個小孩子。英國人的目的，要使每人都爲他自己建築一個家庭。無論男女，按照英國法律，到了二十一歲就算成年，可以離開父母而自由獨立。</p>
<p>許多有錢的英國人，至少有兩所屋子：一所在鄕下，一所在城裏。但是小康之家，也可以在他原有的房屋之外，有一個鄕村住所，或一個海邊木屋，爲着他們週末和假期休息之用。</p>
<p>英國人很考究房屋的建築和室內的裝飾和布置。有些定期雜誌，專門討論這些問題。許多在幾個時代以前建築的房屋依舊存在。他們的建築形式，是按照那個時代的皇家尊號而定的。譬如像維多利亞時代，喬治時代，安娜時代，丘奪爾時代等等。這一類房屋多半是屬於有名的貴族的家庭，他們以保留古老的建築而很目豪，很喜歡談論他們房屋的歷史價值，因此變成了他們茶會和宴會時的普通談話資料。</p>
<p>有這樣房屋的主人常僱用了一大批僕役。譬如管事的，下手，管家的女人，客堂女僕臥室女僕，廚子及府房女僕等。雖然祇有幾個主人住在道一所大房屋裏，所有僕役却很忙碌。因爲要把這屋子保留最好的形式，牆壁上要有和屋子同一時代的裝飾，傢具也差不多配成同一時代的式樣。我的一個英國朋友，他有一所丘奪爾時代的房屋在英國北部的山上，我常被邀到那房屋裏去住一兩個禮拜。那裏有許多地方使我覺得非常有趣。樓梯用石頭砌成，因爲有五六百年的歷史，變成了滑溜溜的，上下的人總要抓住吊在旁邊的「根粗大繩子才行。這位朋友特別喜歡這山上的房屋，雖然他在倫敦也有一所安娜時代的房屋，可是他並不常到倫敦來。</p>
<p>話又說轉來，個人的愛好原是不同的，有許多英國人非常趨隨時髦。近幾年來英國各大城中都建樂了很多集合樓房，差不多在每所建築成功的時候，就有許多趨之若驚。有的房聞有很好的傢具，並且按着最流行的時式來裝飾。牆壁上掛些歌舞明星與俄國農村的玩偶等。簇新式是用極新派的方形傢具，牆壁上掛些印象派，立體派或超現實派的畫。至於實用式，那就是用鋼鐵和玻璃等所造的傢具。布置在人，這不過峪舉幾個例子罷了。</p>
<p>戰爭</p>
<h3>大戰與鴿子</h3>
<p>— 華志</p>
<p>現代的軍軍交通，日新月異。十九世紀的軍隊，每天行進二十英哩，已是非常的紀錄，二十世紀的軍隊在摩登化的汽車路上，每日行進三百英哩，也算不上什麼。跟着戰事速率的推進，以前用星期和月份來計數的，現在已用日子和鐘點來計算，各種傳遞消息的利器，如無綫電報，廣播及電話等等，層出不窮，然而無綫電常受氣候的影響，電話綫時有損壞的危險，所以古昔的交通工具軍用鴿子，在現代的戰塲上，非特沒有被淘汰，而且增加了威力。</p>
<p>近世戰役中，最先大規模利用鴿子的，當以一八七〇年普法之戰爲嘴矢，當時巴黎被圍，就利用大批鴿子，傳遞信息，但也不過數百頭而已，及至上次歐戰發生，各國利用鴿子的，巳增加到三千餘頭。至於此次大戰爆發之初，西部前錢的軍用鴿，往返頻繁，共計十萬餘頭，較上次歐戰時超出了三倍，它所發揮的效力，甚至有超過無綫電與電話所能爲的呢。</p>
<h3>開店</h3>
<p>— 銘勛</p>
<p>人如果像一家店，那麽，體格便是本錢，知識就是夥友，信用便是牌子，良心，當然是這店的監察員。</p>
<p>如果沒有本錢，店當然開不成，沒有適當的夥友，店就不起色，牌子不彈硬，生意永無興隆之日。監察員如果太過放縱，顚倒是非，那末，這店便要越做越亂來，結果，終免不了被人淘汰，而閉門大吉。</p>
<h3>失望</h3>
<p>— 方靜</p>
<p>失望是希望的反面。</p>
<p>眞正有認識的人是決沒有失望的，因爲他能很正確地把握他的希望。</p>
<p>大多數人的失望，都是因爲希望鎖了的綠故。</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第四章　幾種推想</p>
<p>霍桑忽又自動地補充。「你所以把陸健笙除外，就因你對於「寃桶心理」的研究太透澈了！你須知大都會裏的寃桶雖多，也並不是出於一個典型；並且心理的狀態千變萬化，就是同一個寃桶，在不同的環境和情勢之下，也會反映出截然不同的心理狀態。須知他們「悖入」了，有時也未必肯隨意「悖出」啊。」</p>
<p>汽車又因紅燈而停止了。我一時不知道怎樣答覆霍桑的空泛的理論。霍桑忽回過頭來向我微笑着說：「你怎麼靜默起來了？」</p>
<p>我答道：「我在靜聽你的高論啊。那末，你以爲陸健笙眞有兇手嫌疑嗎？」</p>
<p>他一面將汽車繼續駛行，一面又笑道：「包朗，我相信文學頭腦跟科學頭腦，這中間的確界着一條鴻溝。我吿訴你，眼前我的腦子裏，誰也有嫌疑，誰也沒有嫌疑。……唉，亞東到了。」</p>
<p>我們進了旅館，先在旅吝表上找尋七七四號。這號數下面標着「金君」二字。我有些失望，霍桑却並無表示。</p>
<p>我低聲道：「莫非這趙伯雄已經搬走？」</p>
<p>霍桑答道：「我們上去問一問再說，他儘可能化名。——且慢，讓我先打一個電話給倪金壽。」</p>
<p>霍桑走到電話間去。我等在外面，見他撥的號碼是警察總署。一回兒電綫接通了。</p>
<p>他斷續地說：「我是霍桑，請倪探長接話。……還沒有回來？……他有電話嗎？怎麼說？……今天沒有上課……晤，唔。……他此刻到那兒去了？……好。」他隨手將聽筒擱好。</p>
<p>我等他回出來時低聲問他。「可是那余甘棠今天沒有上課？」</p>
<p>霍桑點頭道：「是的，連宿舍裏都不在。倪金壽已問過幾個余甘棠的同學，據說他這幾天缺課很多，行蹤也很飄忽。」</p>
<p>「這樣看來，這個人的嫌疑似乎又加重了一層。是不是？」（六四）</p>

<h3>佐麥克利的田園生活</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>家鄉發跡</p>
<p>佐麥克利的家鄕是好莢塢，而電影是他選取的工作，因此，好萊塢就是他發跡的地方。早年時代，佐在中學裏面讀書，因爲他知道影片公司的門口是不大好走進去的，所以他再也想不到自己能有一天，可成電影明星。祇是對於戲劇，他一向就很愛好，尤其是富有着演劇天才，學校裏表演戲劇總由他担任重要的男角。</p>
<p>大好機會</p>
<p>由中學而大學，在四年的大學生活中，和在中學裏面一樣，時常有表演學校戲劇四年快過去了，有一次幸運之神光臨到他的頭上；校中排演戲劇，他担任男主角，對手是女同學琪恩何特。那女角的父親是電影導演，他到學校裏來參觀女兒的演戲就賞識了佐麥克利的演技，慫恿他畢業後大可投身電影界。</p>
<p>成功經過</p>
<p>導演的目光究竟是不差的，佐麥克利聽了他的話，離開學校後，就投身銀幕。由臨時演員升做地位很重要的大明星，一帆風順，向前邁進。先後在雷電華，米高梅，廿世紀，福斯等主演不少影片，成績進步得很快。他是一個愛好運動的人，游泳是他嗜好的運動，他整個的時閒，消磨在海灘的上面。對於網球和騎馬，也是很嫻熟的。</p>
<p>田園生活</p>
<p>近年以來佐麥克利對於田園生活，特別愛好。在好萊塢的附近，他有着二十畝的農田，一部分是闢作牧塲，一部分種着農作物。耕地下種，他都會自己動手。現在他還在把這種工作，敎導給他的兒子。如果沒有戲拍，他就時常在那邊和他的夫人茀蘭茜蒂及兒女等住在一起，享天倫之樂。據他自己說，他的愛好田園生活，由於遺傳，還是他祖父遺傳給他的呢。</p>
<h3>「正在想」</h3>
<p>曹禺的三部曲，雷雨，日出，原野，恐怕喜歡看話劇的觀衆沒有不知道的。曹君任職重慶國立戲劇專校，想校務紛繁，很久沒有新作發表了。最近聞已完成了二部劇本：一爲「蛻變」，巳在重慶上演，鬨動全渝，另爲獨幕長劇，名「正在想」，已寄滬發表在最近出版之劇塲藝術第六七期合刋上，內容描寫）沒落的走江湖班子，鑒於本身營業慘淡，乃臨時改行演話劇，以致笑話百出。全劇滑稽梯突，涉筆成趣，是一標準的優秀鬧劇。曹君過去發表的作品，均爲嚴肅風貌，而本劇却是劇作家認爲最不易下筆的喜劇，故允爲難能可貴。該劇已定爲上海劇藝社權上海屋　下後之劇目，屆時定能鬨動全滬之話劇迷。</p>
<h3>偉大崇高的「孔夫子」</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>近半年來，常接讀者和影迷的來信，問我「孔夫子」何時可以獻映？此片的情節怎樣？我回答他們說：「民華對「孔夫子」攝製的態度極端認眞，編導費穆先生更不是組製濫造的人；雖然費了一年以上的時光，却還不能預料何日公映。至於情節呢，我不曾讀過這劇本，也沒看過試片，怎樣好，我是不敢說，但保證意識高超，內容嚴肅，有功於世道人心，是可以斷言的……。」</p>
<p>最近接民華來信微文，爲「孔夫子」出特刊，預備擇八月中旬在大光明公映，這是多麼樂意的喜訊！我自從國產片競趨古裝一途後，久未欣賞，以示個人所抱的傾向，但涇渭究須分淸，「孔夫子」雖屬古裝片，又當別論，我非竭誠擁護它不可。一則以我個人從小曾受至聖先師的遺敎，深感孔敎的偉大；二則此片鄭重攝製，打破國片空前的紀錄，我人將於此片一覘國片進步的一斑。</p>
<p>「孔夫子」是國產古裝片的崇高作品，值得擁護，這已是一般人的公言，而非一巳之私意；敬以此祝民華製片業的成功！</p>
<h3>民間電影　夏霞不感興趣</h3>
<p>— 海星</p>
<p>國聯之九部民間故事的影片中，每一演員多者四五部，少者一兩部，都派着戲，但夏霞落空，一部也沒有，據說這是夏霞的要求，她因爲身體　弱，不耐趕戲，同時對於民間故事不感興趣，當她把這一要求向張善琨提出時，張氏表示決不勉强，因此夏霞就沒有戲了。據聞夏霞根本對於銀幕生活已感厭倦，因爲在銀幕上，她被派到的角色往往是老婦之類——例如「盡忠報國」的岳母，她以為這些角色不能使她盡量發揮，此後夏霞將改變作風，專在舞台上顯共好身手了。</p>

<h3>The Chinese Army in Southern Guangxi Repeatedly Defeats the Japanese Offensive; The Japanese Army's Large-Scale Offensive Towards the Yonglong Road is Repelled; The Chinese Army in the Jin City and Gaoping Area Advances Rapidly</h3>
<p>Liuzhou: The Guangxi Army has recently repeatedly defeated the Japanese offensive. A few days ago, the Japanese army launched a large-scale offensive towards Luotian on the Yonglong Road but was ambushed by the mobile Chinese army. By the 27th, they were unable to withstand and fled. (2nd Telegram)</p>
<p>Liuzhou: At dawn on the 29th, the Japanese army, advancing along the Yonglong Road towards Longnong Village, used four cannons and four tanks to cover their infantry in a fierce attack on the Chinese army. The Chinese army met them head-on with a heavy blow, and a fierce battle unfolded. From morning to noon, the sounds of artillery and machine guns shook the sky. The Japanese launched repeated assaults but ultimately failed. The two sides are still engaged in a bloody battle. (2nd Telegram)</p>
<p>Luoyang: More than a thousand Japanese troops with more than ten cannons stationed in the Ba Gongzhen and Gaodu area northeast of Jin City, simultaneously attacked the Fengtou Village south along the Jincheng-Lingchuan Avenue on the morning of the 27th. The Chinese army engaged them in separate counterattacks, resulting in fierce fighting. Another unit of the Chinese army happened to advance to the area between Gaoping and Jin City at this time, taking advantage of the enemy's weakness to launch a surprise attack from the rear. The advance was very rapid, and the encirclement was gradually tightening. (2nd Telegram)</p>
<h3>Jiang Tingfu Issues a Statement After Returning to Chongqing</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Jiang Tingfu, Director of the Political Affairs Department of the Executive Yuan, recently led a political inspection group of five people to inspect the six provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Guangxi. Having returned here, he recently issued a statement to the press, elaborating on his impressions of the trip. He said that he had contacted people from all walks of life in the six provinces and had informal conversations to understand the economic situation of the six southeastern provinces, which was very good. The prosperity of the rural areas in our interior allows trained and experienced talents to have development opportunities. For example, the slaughter tax collected by various provinces has increased sharply, indicating that farmers have sold agricultural products at high prices, resulting in higher incomes. The consumption of pork has also increased, which also reflects the prosperity of the interior. Secondly, the land tax revenue of various provinces has also increased. Although the land tax itself has not increased, because most farmers are wealthy, they can afford to pay off accumulated taxes. In addition, there is ample cash everywhere, and it is very common for debtors to redeem their mortgages. Furthermore, there is another phenomenon that is quite noteworthy: old-fashioned textile machines that have been idle for a long time have recently been put into use again. This is because the source of fabrics from outside has become less and less, and the trend of people in various places weaving and spinning their own cloth is becoming more common. This measure not only solves the problem of people's clothing but also prevents capital from flowing out. In addition, ordinary merchants have great foresight and have stockpiled a large amount of gasoline, various metal machines, and other commodities many years ago, which is also of great benefit to the country's welfare during the war of resistance. However, on the other hand, the greatest difficulty in the six southeastern provinces lies in the lack of technical talent. Even in terms of workers, there is a great shortage of workers due to the implementation of the compulsory military service system and the recruitment of workers to build roads or to serve in transportation. There are also not enough trained intellectuals to go to the interior to guide emerging businesses. Therefore, there are now a large number of important positions that require experienced talent. The county magistrates told me that the prosperity in the interior is unprecedented in the past twenty years. As for the finances of the various provinces, they are very sound. Tax revenues have increased significantly. In addition, the various economic and trade undertakings run by the provincial authorities have generated huge profits. Even land that was previously considered uncultivable is now being cultivated. In short, there is no shortage of food. The only problem is transportation. (1st Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Jiang Zuobin Inspects Political Affairs in Yunnan</h3>
<p>Kunming: Jiang Zuobin, Chairman of the Yunnan-Guizhou Group of the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Inspection Team, accompanied by members Duanmu Kai, Zhang Yuanzhao, Wang Zhuoran, Yu Yueyou, and Li Peitian, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, departed from Kunming to inspect the counties in western Yunnan. That evening, they arrived in Chuxiong. On the 26th, they arrived in Dali, attended the county's welcoming conference, and inspected various agencies separately. They inquired in great detail about various political affairs and comforted the families of soldiers before returning to Kunming. According to Jiang, the ten counties in western Yunnan have achieved remarkable political achievements, and various tasks are being implemented step by step according to plan, which is very satisfactory. He now plans to stay in the province for three or four days before heading to the southwest to inspect. (2nd Telegram)</p>

<p>Chongqing: When Japanese aircraft raided Chengdu on the 24th of last month, two were shot down by the Chinese side. One was discovered early on, but the other was not found in the southern suburbs of Chengdu until today. (1st Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3>The National Government Issues a Decree Praising Zhou Junyan</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The National Government issued a decree on the 2nd, stating that Zhou Junyan, Director of the Quartermaster General Supervision Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs, was loyal and honest, and upheld integrity. He participated in the revolution in Guangdong, assisted the military, and transported supplies to aid the Northern Expedition five years ago. He made significant contributions. In recent years, he has served in the central government, presided over the affairs of the Military Affairs Department, planned meticulously, and left no stone unturned. He worked diligently from morning to night, and his loyalty and trustworthiness were widely recognized by officers and soldiers. During the three years of the War of Resistance, he provided supplies without delay, which greatly benefited the military. It was expected that he would contribute his wisdom and talents for a long time, but the news of his death from illness was sudden and deeply mourned. He is hereby given a public commendation, with 5,000 yuan allocated for funeral expenses, and the Military Affairs Commission is instructed to provide generous compensation. His life's deeds will be preserved and announced to the National History Museum to recognize his loyalty and comfort his soul. This decree (2nd Telegram)</p>

<h3>The National Government Reissues an Order to Rectify Official Conduct</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The National Government issued an order on the 1st, stating that selecting virtuous and capable people is an essential task for the country. It is imperative to ensure that everyone is competent in their position, so that governance can be prosperous and enlightened. A clear order was issued in 1928 stating that senior officials should not recommend individuals to lower or parallel agencies in their personal capacity, in order to eliminate the malpractice of favoritism and prevent the pursuit of solicitation. The intention was far-reaching and does not need further explanation. Now, in this extraordinary period of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, the responsibilities are extremely heavy, and it is even more necessary to promote true talent and prevent opportunism. However, the previous order has been in effect for a long time, and it is feared that there may be outward compliance but inward defiance. It is essential to reiterate the warning. All internal and external officials must strictly abide by it. In addition to recommending and employing subordinates in accordance with the law based on their authority, they must strictly avoid relying on personal relationships to solicit other lower or parallel agencies in order to eliminate redundancy and purify the officialdom. Those who are responsible for supervising personnel and administration should also pay close attention to this matter, correct any deviations in a timely manner, and set an example for colleagues. They should uphold the ideals of impartiality and loyalty and jointly establish good rules for selection. Great expectations are placed on them. This order (1st Telegram)</p>
<h3>The National Government Appoints Supervisors for the Higher Examination</h3>

<h3>German Reporter Stationed in Chongqing Hosts a Gathering for Various Circles</h3>

He greatly admired the spirit of hard struggle in Chongqing under the ruthless bombing, which he believed represented the strong and unyielding will of the Chinese people. After the meal, lantern slide films of the German army, navy, and air force fighting in Norway, Belgium, and France were shown, including the operations of the German air force, the landing of parachute troops, and the storming of tanks capturing enemy generals. The gathering ended at 11:00 pm. (1st Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Yunnan Provincial Government Restricts the Purchase of Rice</h3>
<p>Chongqing: It has recently been learned that the Yunnan Provincial Government has decided to implement measures to restrict the purchase of rice in order to prevent hoarding and ensure that there is no shortage of food for the people. This measure is of great benefit to the poor. Taking Kunming as an example, about 100 tons of rice are needed every day for price stabilization sales. (1st Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>The British Ship "Foshan" is Detained in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>Guangzhou: The British ship "Foshan," which sails from Guangzhou to Hong Kong every Thursday, was unable to sail out yesterday morning after all the passengers had boarded because the manager of the ship, Taikoo Company, disagreed with the Japanese pilot. According to Dinstel, manager of Taikoo Company, the ship could not sail because there was no pilot. Although Taikoo Company was unwilling to explain the reason for the lack of a pilot, it was learned from reliable sources that this was due to disagreement over pilotage fees. The "Foshan" is now indefinitely detained here, pending the outcome of ongoing negotiations. (2nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Sichuan Opium Inspection Team Prepares to Depart</h3>
<p>Chengdu: Jiang, the concurrent head of the Sichuan Opium Inspection Team, specially appointed Chu Fucheng, director of the Wanzhou Office of the Sichuan-Kang Construction Promotion Association, to come to the province to act as the head of the team in his place, in order to show seriousness, as the team's organization is ready and will depart soon. The Opium Suppression Supervision Office has urgently telegraphed Chu to come quickly. The team is divided into (16) groups, and the group leaders are appointed by the central government and various relevant agencies, the Sichuan provincial party and government, the military, and members of the Senate. If local officials are found to have violated laws or neglected their duties, the provincial government may be telegraphed to immediately remove and punish them. If an opium offender is truly unforgivable, the team leader may telegraph the case to Chairman Chiang for approval and execute them on the spot in order to show a stern warning and demonstrate the government's determination to eradicate opium.

<h3>The Problem of General Social Health</h3>
<p>There are no accurate statistics on the mortality rate of Shanghai residents. What we see and hear is that there are dozens of deaths on the streets every day, and beggars suffering from illness are everywhere. There are countless people from poor families groaning in bed, dying without access to medicine, and in general, dying from quack doctors and fake medicines. Therefore, when we read the news from yesterday's newspaper about the thirtieth birthday of the "Iron Lung Man," can we not sigh? The American Mr. Snyder is known as the "Iron Lung Man." He traveled to China in March 1936 and suddenly contracted paralysis in Beiping. His breathing was near cessation, so he was kept in an iron lung and could not leave it for a moment. Yesterday's report said that this man was able to leave his iron lung and celebrate his thirtieth birthday, and his wife will give birth next month. To entrust one's life to an iron lung, with life and death hanging on breathing, and yet not die; not only not die, but gradually recover one's original functions and be able to bear children, is truly a miracle of medical progress.</p>
<p>Although medicine today is indeed advanced, its progress is revealed differently depending on the person. Without Mr. Snyder's wealth, one would be paralyzed and die tragically, with a tomb long built. Even if one is fortunate enough to live with the disease, the suffering one endures is no less than a living hell. Mr. Snyder not only returned to the United States from China, but also went to France from the United States, enjoying life freely. In New York, he visited the World's Fair, and in Germany, he watched tennis matches with a reflective mirror installed in his iron lung. Although his body was paralyzed, the medical treatment was certainly unimpeded, and his mind was at ease, so even a fatal illness could be overcome. If one cannot get the right doctor or medicine, or gets the doctor but not the medicine, or gets the medicine but not the doctor, or even has no medicine or doctor, then even a curable illness can lead to death. Therefore, whether a person lives or dies is not only determined by nature but also depends on human efforts to help.</p>
<p>Looking back at the patients in Shanghai society today, how can they be compared? They do not expect to have even a fraction of Mr. Snyder's treatment and care, but they struggle in their sickbeds and wander on the path of life and death. There are countless people who cannot get good doctors and medicine and eventually die; some are harmed by quack doctors and fake medicines and die; and some seek medical treatment and medicine but cannot find it and hasten their death. These people do not die from disease but from lack of money, doctors, and medicine. People who die from lack of money, doctors, and medicine can be said to have died an unnatural death or to be a symptom of a sick society.</p>
<p>Today, the only saviors for the poor and sick are the free clinics run by various charities. Speaking of free clinics, only six or seven have somewhat decent facilities. Among them, Renji Charity provides treatment to about seven or eight hundred people every day, charging a registration fee of two dimes and providing a dose of medicine. It is indeed providing great benefits to the poor and sick. This is a large number within the scope of one charity's free clinic, but compared to the vast sea of people suffering from illness, it is probably very small. From this, we can see that even the benefits of these free clinics are not universally available. Moreover, most free clinics run by charities are limited to traditional Chinese medicine, and Western medicine is rare. Therefore, those who seek Western medical treatment must go to hospitals with a more public nature, but they are crowded, rushed, and indifferent. If patients want an accurate diagnosis, they have to seek private doctors. Private doctors who claim to offer free treatment to the poor are as rare as morning stars, and even when they exist, there are many things that are not "free." Therefore, after seeking treatment once or twice, they have no ability to seek further medical care. They can only rely on their own strength to fight the disease. If they are lucky and win, they live; if they are unlucky and lose, they die. Such tragedies are commonly seen and heard by ordinary people, and they have no time to sigh.</p>
<p>Who is to blame for this, and it is indeed very difficult to remedy. We cannot say much about construction, but we can only hope to improve the situation. We know that for every undertaking to be successful, both talent and wealth are indispensable. If there is wealth but no talent, it is simply a waste and does not benefit the undertaking. If there is talent but no wealth, then one toils diligently but achieves little. Therefore, to solve the suffering of the poor and sick, first, we must still hope that the public will share compassion, with those who have the ability helping those who do not, and those who have money helping those who do not. Second, providing medical treatment and medicine is a noble cause. Do not be greedy for fame, but there should be reality. Medical treatment should be precise and thorough, and medicines should be genuine and authentic. To do a superficial job and use fake medicines is not to save people but to kill them. It is seeking life but getting death, and doing good turns into evil. Third, if you are willing to serve the poor and sick, you should be without complaint or anger, and be sincere and respectful. You should know that most patients are frustrated. A little sympathy will bring great comfort. To be rude will be a great stimulus. We must hope that doctors and nurses will show compassion.</p>
<p>However, this is only for the poor and sick. For salaried workers, in addition to the medical and pharmaceutical benefits provided by the organizations they serve, which are their rights as employees, they have permanent jobs and should not rely on charity. They should only take good care of themselves. However, salaries are limited, and serious illnesses are a cause for concern. Even if savings are not small, prolonged illness is also a cause for concern. To bear the heavy burden of a family with one person's strength, to face unexpected illness with a fixed income, the salaried class, even if they take great care of themselves, often cannot protect themselves completely. Then, what is to be done? To rely on individual efforts is bound to be insufficient. To pray to Buddha in an emergency will have no effect. The key is to use collective power to create a well-organized organization. You must first share the burden of medical facilities when you are healthy, and then you will not have to worry about treatment costs when you are sick. This is effective self-help, lasting cooperation, and a rational and cost-effective method. There is no better plan. Gathering many people makes the task easier. This is the main point. With this collective strength, hire doctors who are knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and ethical to create a "health association" with comprehensive planning. Health associations are modern social organizations and are by no means a way for city doctors to attract long-term customers, make money, and seek profit.</p>
<h3>Japan's Closeness to the Axis Powers Deepens the Rift with the United States; There is a Trend to Re-Fortify Guam; The United States Halts the Shipment of 350,000 Barrels of Gasoline to Japan</h3>
<p>Washington: According to unofficial and political circles last night, the basic policies of the new Japanese cabinet announced in Tokyo yesterday are likely to increase the existing rift between the United States and Japan. Secretary of State Hull and his subordinates refused to comment, but most people in Washington believe that there is nothing particularly new in this statement regarding Japanese policy. Many believe that there has been a gradual change in Japan's recent domestic and foreign policies. Japan is now seen as having acknowledged the abandonment of a nominal parliamentary system in favor of an all-powerful political system. It is believed that Japan is now focusing on the "Greater East Asia" plan, including the South Sea Islands. These trends indicate that Japan will eliminate its friendship with democratic countries and move closer to the Axis powers. It is unclear whether US-Japan relations will immediately deteriorate as a result, and depends on how Japan implements its announced plans. Various countries here yesterday warmly welcomed the publication of Japan's statement, although there were no community reviews on the matter for the time being, but the titles used by various newspapers implied their reaction. The Times Herald published the statement on the front page with the headline "Japanese Declare Asia Belongs to Us" "Japan Warns the United States of 'Non-Friendly' Embargoes" The Washington Star added a huge headline across the entire page above the message, calling "Japan Actively Governs the Entire Asia," Daily News headline calls "Japan Announces Far East Rule Plans," (2nd United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>Washington: California Democratic Congressman Isaac told a United Press reporter last night that Japan's recent announcement of its foreign policy may stimulate the United States Congress to support the proposal to fortify Guam. Isaac is a staff member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and believes that Japan's renewed announcement of its domestic and foreign policies in Tokyo will make the US Congress and the people feel that "the policy of appeasement toward Japan is useless." He said that Congress should take a tougher stance toward Japan in the future, and Congress is likely to strengthen Guam's defenses this autumn or early next year. Isaac also said, "Whenever there are events in Europe, Japan begins to act in the East. Japan believes that once Britain fails, we will be forced to withdraw from the Pacific. However, I do not believe that we have this intention, at least for now." Republican Congressman Fish said that he believes that the Roosevelt administration's intervention in the Far East is the reason for forcing Japan to change its current policies. He said, "I have long believed that if the government continues to take an anti-Japanese stance everywhere, the result will be to drive Japan closer to Germany and Italy or even closer to the Soviet Union. The situation in the Far East today is very regrettable, but we should bear a part of the responsibility ourselves." (2nd United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>Washington: It was calculated here yesterday that President Roosevelt's ban on the export of aviation gasoline has stopped the shipment of 350,000 barrels of gasoline from various parts of the United States to Japan. (2nd United Press Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister Elaborates on New Cabinet's Foreign Policy: Abandoning the "Appeasing All Sides" Policy, Preparing to Adopt an Offensive Diplomacy</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, Tokyo Dispatch: Due to the abstract nature of Matsuoka's statements, which were difficult to understand, he held a press conference on the afternoon of the 1st to explain further. His main points were that Japan will adopt an offensive diplomacy, abandoning its "appeasing all sides" policy. The policy adopted by previous cabinets, cooperating with countries that are beneficial to resolving the "China Incident," and abandoning countries that obstruct Japan's actions in China, was originally reasonable. However, in the current environment, the new cabinet will first strive to find as many allies as possible to thoroughly implement Japan's foreign policy. Among the countries of the world, there are those who wish to cooperate with Japan, but there are also those who oppose it. Japan will not seek friendly relations with countries that refuse to cooperate with Japan, and will thoroughly liquidate the diplomacy of "appeasing all sides." The "non-intervention" policy, once decided, will be temporarily maintained. The establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will take Japan, "Manchukuo," and China as its axis. Handling the China Incident remains the most urgent task, with no change in history. It goes without saying that Greater East Asia will include Southeast Asia. The goal is to create a self-sufficient economic unit encompassing Japan, "Manchukuo," China, the Dutch East Indies, Vietnam, and others, to establish a stable factor in East Asia. In short, the time for further explanation of the new cabinet's foreign policy has not yet arrived, and a concrete announcement will be made when the time comes. Judging from his remarks, the so-called "non-intervention" policy is gradually changing, but this may inevitably contain the effect of threatening Britain and the United States. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: Today's editorial in the Daily Telegraph stated that the policy statement issued by the new Japanese government and the remarks by Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka clarifying this policy were both sharply worded and unclear in meaning. The diplomatic policy now proclaimed by Japan is substantially the same as that announced by former Foreign Minister Arita. Matsuoka did not provide further explanation, except to say that French Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies are within the scope of Japan's objectives. What Matsuoka added was a provocative statement that Japan will not shake hands with any foreign country that refuses to cooperate with Japan's current plans. In the three years of Japan's war against China, the rapid turnover of cabinets has been bewildering, but their nature has been the same. Each new cabinet takes office with a program to end the war with more severe actions than the previous cabinet. Therefore, today both Matsuoka and Konoe have the complete resolution of the China situation as their primary goal. Although Japan will currently not interfere in European affairs, it will use the changes in the international situation to express hostile words towards Britain and the United States and focus on the Dutch East Indies to advance its objectives. It is regrettable that the Japanese government has been forced to expose this attitude. It is expected that the Japanese militarists will protest vehemently against the United States' refusal to supply them with scrap iron, oil, or aviation fuel, but they are in this difficulty through their own fault and cannot blame others. The ambitions of Japanese militarism, as applied to China's national interests and the general well-being of the world, have caused great harm. Apart from Britain, no country is more affected than the United States. Japanese politicians must understand that they cannot expect to rely on American resources to prolong the brutal acts in the war against China. The day of subjugating China is no closer than it was three years ago, which is a clear fact. Japan's military strength is being depleted in the provinces of China to a great extent, and its important war materials have now been completely deprived and cannot be obtained. Threats against the Dutch East Indies will not help the overall situation. The prosperity of East Asia is Japan's true interest, but to achieve this goal, only peaceful means can be taken.

<h3>Outline of Japan's Basic National Policy</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, Tokyo 1st Dispatch: After the establishment of the Konoe Cabinet, a four-minister conference was held on the 19th of last month to decide on the outline of national policies for building a new order in East Asia and dealing with the world situation. The cabinet officially decided on it today, and the government immediately announced its content at home and abroad. The outline is as follows: (1) (Fundamental Policy) Based on the spirit of the universal brotherhood of mankind, seek to establish world peace. The first step is to build a new order in Greater East Asia with Japan as its core and the strong combination of China, Japan, and Manchukuo as its foundation. Therefore, Japan itself will also quickly establish a national system adapted to the new situation and devote all its national strength to advancing. (2) (National Defense and Diplomacy) In view of the new situation at home and abroad, the national defense and national system that exert the overall strength of the country should be the foundation for strengthening military preparations. Current diplomacy is based on building a new order in Greater East Asia. First, place its focus on ending the China Incident, examine major international changes, and consider constructive and flexible strategies to advance the country's destiny. (3) (Reforms of the Domestic System) The urgent task of domestic politics is to reform various policies based on the true meaning of the national polity and establish the foundation of the national defense and national system. Because of the following points, it is necessary to realize them: (A) On the one hand, reform education to suit the true meaning of the national polity, and at the same time, reject the ideology of self-serving studies and establish a national morality that takes serving the country and the public as the primary principle. (B) Establish a strong new political system to achieve comprehensive unity of national politics. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan Arrests Two More British Nationals; British Ambassador Conducts Negotiations; Spokesperson of the Japanese Foreign Ministry States that Any Protest from the British Side Will Be Rejected</h3>
<p>London: According to official sources here today, two more British nationals have been arrested by the Japanese authorities in Korea. One is the Anglican minister Mr. Chatwin, and the other is Mr. Sanford. The British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, has made representations to the Japanese side regarding this matter. Nothing has been heard here regarding the crimes they are accused of. A total of nine British nationals are currently detained in Japan. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mr. Hinuma Yoshiro recently stated that the Japanese government will reject any protests from the British side regarding the arrest of British individuals in Japan on suspicion of espionage. The spokesman pointed out that this case is entirely a domestic matter and does not fall within the scope of foreign protests. Suma made these remarks in response to inquiries from journalists, who asked whether the Japanese government would ignore any British protests regarding the Japanese arrest of British nationals. The spokesman continued, saying that the arrest of British nationals is necessary to maintain Japan's domestic peace and order and is carried out in accordance with Japanese law. Therefore, this case should be completely classified as a domestic matter. However, Suma acknowledged that this matter has some other aspects. He then admitted that this move is a result of Japan's changing foreign policy. The spokesman pointed out that, in essence, there has been no absolute change in Japan's national policy, but there may be some changes in foreign policy to adapt to the new international situation. (2nd Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: Reliable sources here learned last night that Japan has released six arrested British nationals but charged them with attempted espionage, which is not satisfactory to the British government. Unless the Japanese military police quickly release the seven British nationals who are still detained, Britain may take special action. It is recalled here that the arrest of thirteen British nationals by Japan without warning has made a very deep impression on the British. Japan's retention of the documents of the six released individuals, indicating that Japan may still prosecute them, has further displeased the British. According to authoritative sources, the British Ambassador to Tokyo, Sir Robert Craigie, has protested to the Japanese government, demanding an explanation for the arrest incident. Recently, the intelligence department of the Japanese military clearly declared Britain to be a "hostile power." Responsible parties here believe that Japan is deliberately excluding British and other foreign interests in China. However, they express doubt about Japan's reconsideration of a large-scale war with Britain. Their meaning may be that Britain is also strongly aware that in the final stages of the development of the situation in the Far East, Japan may have demands for Hong Kong. General observers here believe that Hong Kong is not a place that can be defended for long, but they analyze that if Japan attacks the area, it will face military resistance. There is strong confidence here that any action by Japan against Singapore will recognize Britain's stronger position. (2nd Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Remains of Ma Junwu Were Placed in a Coffin Yesterday</h3>
<p>Guilin: Since becoming the president of National Guangxi University, Ma Junwu has spared no effort in planning and managing the university, paying attention to both spiritual and material aspects, and the university's affairs have been thriving.

<h3>The Joint Session of the Two Houses of the Soviet Union Unanimously Approves Foreign Policy: Maintaining Neutrality and Never Participating in War; Representatives of the Three Baltic States Attended</h3>
<p>Moscow: The Federal Council and the National Council held a joint session today, and the situation was extremely enthusiastic. The speakers of the two houses were all present at 7:00 PM in the evening. In addition, the representatives of the Dahanov faction, workers from the Moscow factory, and Red Army personnel were present. There were no empty seats in the crowded venue. At exactly 7:00, Stalin, Molotov, Voroshilov, Kalinin, Kaganovich, Mikoyan, Zhetnov, Khrushchev, Beria, Malenkov, Timoshenko, and the speakers and deputy speakers of the two houses of the Supreme Soviet entered the venue. The guests all stood up and cheered for several minutes, congratulating Stalin and his comrades.</p>
<p>The Speaker of the Federal Council, Mr. Anduyev, announced the opening of the meeting and stated that the representatives of the Plenipotentiary Committees of Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia and the Baybu region were all present. At this time, the entire venue responded with warm cheers. Mr. An also congratulated the Plenipotentiary Representatives on behalf of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The conference then began to discuss the first item on the agenda. Molotov immediately stood up to report, and the entire venue also stood up and cheered for the head of the Soviet government. Mr. Mo reported for an hour, and the audience paid attention to the content of the report every minute, expressing satisfaction with the victory of the Soviet Union's peaceful policies. When Mr. Mo announced the resolution of the Soviet-Romanian disputes for 22 years, the recovery of the Baybu region, and the establishment of Soviet power in the three Baltic countries, the crowd responded with cheers again. In conclusion, Molotov quoted Stalin as saying, "We should always be in a state of mobilization and be prepared to deal with any military attack so that all the enemy's tricks cannot be implemented." After Mr. Mo finished speaking, the crowd gave him even warmer cheers.</p>
<p>Then, Congressman Stibakov delivered a speech, pointing out the victories achieved by the Soviet Union's peaceful policies and saying that the Soviet people unanimously agreed with the government's policies and measures. Finally, on the motion of Mr. Shi, the conference decided not to debate the foreign policy report any further. So, amid cheers from the crowd, the conference passed the conference's foreign policy. (1st Tass Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Molotov's Foreign Policy Report</h3>
<p>Moscow. Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, reported on the government's foreign policy at a joint session of the Council of the Union and the Council of Nationalities. When Molotov rose to speak, all the deputies of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union stood up and paid tribute to Molotov and Stalin, the leader of all nationalities. The cheering shook the entire venue. The original text of Molotov's speech is as follows:</p>
<p>"Comrades and deputies, it has been four months since the last congress. During this period, extremely important events have occurred in Europe. German military operations have expanded from Norway, Denmark, Belgium, and the Netherlands to France, thus further escalating the European war. On June 10, Italy joined the German side and declared war on Britain and France. Thus, the fourth major European power was drawn into the war. Since the spring, the European war has continued to develop due to the events in Norway, Denmark, Belgium, and the Netherlands. I would particularly like to emphasize the speed of the French defeat. Within a month or six weeks, the German army not only broke through the French resistance but also forced France to sign an armistice agreement. According to this agreement, a large part of France (including Paris) is under German occupation.</p>
<p>France Has Not Yet Achieved Peace</p>
<p>Although France has now achieved an armistice, it has not yet achieved peace. The terms of peace have not yet been ascertained. The only Allied power left to confront Germany and Italy is Britain. The British authorities have decided to continue fighting with American aid. France has fully demonstrated its weakness in wartime. There is no need to elaborate on the reasons for France's defeat. In short, France's defeat was not only due to insufficient military preparation. An important reason was that the French ruling class excessively underestimated the power of the Soviet Union in European affairs. The facts of the past few months have proven the more important reason for the French defeat. The French authorities failed to connect with the people. They not only did not regard the people as the main force but also placed the freedom-loving French people in an unimportant position. This is the most serious factor in France's weakness. The French people now intend to compensate for the post-war trauma, but this task is by no means easy. After all, the restoration of the country cannot be achieved by old methods.</p>
<p>Germany Has Not Achieved Its Main Goal</p>
<p>Although Germany has achieved great success in the war, it has not yet achieved its main goal. In other words, to end the war on terms that Germany desires.</p>
<p>On July 19, the German leader made another peace proposal to Britain, but as far as we know, the British side has rejected the proposal. The British government also believes that the proposal is a demand for Britain to surrender and stated that it will not stop fighting unless it wins. At the same time, the British side also declared that it would sever relations with its former ally, France.</p>
<p>This indicates that Britain is unwilling to give up its colonies scattered around the world. Although Britain is now in a more unfavorable position due to the defeat of France and Italy's participation in the war, it will still fight for world hegemony.</p>
<p>The first year of the European war is coming to an end, but the end of the entire war is still far away. We are now on the eve of a fierce battle between Germany, Italy, Britain, and the United States. Although all these facts have not caused the Soviet Union to change its foreign policy, in order to comply with the policy of peace and neutrality, the Soviet Union will not join the war.</p>
<p>Absolutely Abide by the German-Soviet Agreement</p>
<p>German-Soviet relations have undergone an important transformation as a result of the agreement signed a year ago. The Soviet government absolutely abides by the agreement. When the Soviet Union implemented its policies in the West, no disputes occurred with Germany. This was achieved thanks to the conclusion of the German-Soviet agreement. At the same time, after the completion of the agreement, Germany no longer had to worry about the East. The recent changes in the European situation have not only not weakened the power of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact but have also proven the importance of the pact. Recently, foreign newspapers, especially British newspapers, have repeatedly speculated on the possibility of German-Soviet discord and threatened us with the expansion of German power. In fact, we and Germany have dismissed such rumors and threats with a smile. We would like to solemnly state that the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Germany are entirely based on the common interests of the two countries and are by no means an accidental transitional measure.</p>
<p>Relations with Italy Have Also Improved</p>
<p>Recently, our relations with Italy have also improved. As a result of our exchange of views with the Italian side, it has been proven that there is indeed the possibility of reaching an understanding on foreign policy. At the same time, we also expect that trade between the two countries will develop.</p>
<p>Soviet-British Relations Have Not Changed</p>
<p>As for Soviet-British relations, there have been no changes recently. We believe that as a result of Britain's repeated hostile actions towards us, the relations between the two countries have been unable to develop smoothly. Although Britain sent Cripps as its ambassador to the Soviet Union, it was indeed an attempt to improve relations with us.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's Western Border Reaches the Danube</p>
<p>The victory of our foreign policy has further expanded our territory. On this point, I would now like to elaborate. The details of the merger of the Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina regions into the Soviet Union were published on June 28 and do not need to be repeated. The note I sent to the Romanian Minister included two suggestions: (1) Bessarabia should be returned to the Soviet Union; (2) Northern Bukovina should be transferred to the Soviet Union. As a result, the Romanian government accepted the suggestions, and thus the 22-year dispute was resolved. The majority of the residents of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina are Ukrainians and Moldavians. They have been liberated from the Romanian nobles, landlords, and capitalists and have begun to enjoy a new life. Their inner joy is self-evident. Bessarabia has an area of 44,500 square kilometers and a population of 3.2 million. Northern Bukovina has an area of 6,000 kilometers and a population of 500,000. Since the merger of these two regions into the Soviet Union, the territory of the Soviet Union has greatly increased. As a result, the Soviet border has extended to the west, reaching the Danube. The Danube is one of the largest and most important commercial waterways in Europe. The resolution of this incident is extremely popular among the Soviet people. At the same time, our relations with Romania should develop smoothly in the future.</p>
<p>The Baltic States Issue</p>
<p>I will now continue to elaborate on our relations with Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. Since our mutual assistance pact with these three countries has not been successful, important changes have recently taken place in the relations between the Soviet Union and the Baltic states. The above-mentioned pact has not brought the Soviet Union and these three countries closer together due to the opposition of the rulers.</p>
<p>After signing the mutual assistance pact, the Baltic states not only did not get closer to the Soviet Union but also secretly intensified their hostile activities against the Soviet Union, using the so-called Baltic Entente as a tool. The Baltic Entente originally only included Latvia and Estonia, but at the end of last year, Lithuania also joined the military alliance to confront the Soviet Union. This proves that the small capitalist rulers of the three countries have failed to faithfully abide by the mutual assistance pact. On the contrary, they have intensified their anti-Soviet work. The Soviet Union has obtained a great deal of evidence in this regard. Under the current international situation, such behavior is intolerable. Therefore, the Soviet government had no choice but to demand the reorganization of the governments of the three countries and send the Red Army to each of these countries. You are all aware of the results of the steps taken by our government.</p>
<p>After the establishment of pro-Soviet governments in the three countries, their most important task was the general election of the parliament. General elections were held in the Baltic states in July. The results proved that the small capitalist ruling class of the three countries only represented a minority of exploiters and did not represent the will of the people as a whole. The parliaments of the three countries, elected in accordance with direct and secret ballot laws, have expressed their opinions on general political issues. At the same time, the people of Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia have unanimously supported and assisted in the establishment of Soviet power and transformed the three countries into Soviet socialist republics. At this point, the relations between the Soviet Union and the three countries have been placed on a new foundation. After the merger of the three countries into the Soviet Union, their economy and culture can be developed, and their own strength and security can be consolidated. On the other hand, the power of the Soviet Union has also greatly increased due to the merger of the three countries.</p>
<p>After the Baltic states were merged into the Soviet Union, the population of the Soviet Union greatly increased, including 1.95 million people in Latvia, 1.12 million people in Estonia, and 2.88 million people in Lithuania. Adding the Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina regions, the population of the Soviet Union has increased by a total of 10 million people. If we add the 13 million people in Ukraine, the Soviet Union has increased its population by 23 million people in the past year. This part of the population originally belonged to the Soviet Union in 1920 but was forcibly taken away by the Western imperialist powers using the weak military power of the Soviet Union. This part of the population has now been returned to the Soviet Union. At this point, the total population of the Soviet Union has reached 193 million, not including the increase in 1939 and 1940.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Gains Ice-Free Ports</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Soviet border has extended to the Baltic coast, which is extremely important. At the same time, we have now obtained the ice-free ports that we urgently need. What is more important is that the Soviet Union achieved its goals through peaceful means. The resolution of disputes between the Soviet Union and the Baltic states and its Bessarabia region was entirely due to the support of the people of these countries. The Soviet government should be responsible for the various economic and political construction works in the new republics.</p>
<p>The Soviet-Finnish Peace Treaty Is Smoothly Implemented</p>
<p>At the last congress, I reported on the Soviet-Finnish Peace Treaty. Since the signing of the treaty, more than four months have passed, and the treaty has been smoothly implemented. In addition, the two countries have also concluded a trade agreement, and the development of future economic relations is immeasurable. The Soviet Union's proposal to disarm the Åland Islands has also been accepted by the Finnish side. The Soviet Union is now setting up a consulate there.</p>
<p>Whether future Soviet-Finnish relations can be further improved depends entirely on the efforts of the Finnish side itself. If some elements of the Finnish ruling class do not stop their illegal activities that harm pro-Soviet personnel, Soviet-Finnish relations will be hit.</p>
<p>Develop Economic Relations with Sweden</p>
<p>Our relations with the Scandinavian countries (Norway and Sweden) are entirely dependent on the current situation in the region. Norway's current status is special, and it is impossible to draw a conclusion rashly. As for Sweden, one point is worth noting: both sides are willing to develop trade and economic relations. The two sides are currently conducting negotiations on this point. I sincerely hope that the negotiations will result in an agreement that will benefit both sides.</p>
<p>Diplomacy in the Balkans</p>
<p>Regarding the Balkans, we have established diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia. The failure to establish diplomatic relations between the two countries in the past was not the fault of the Soviet Union. However, the establishment of this relationship was proposed by Yugoslavia and accepted by the Soviet Union. I sincerely hope that Soviet-Yugoslav relations can also gradually improve. Our relations with Bulgaria have returned to normal. There are no obstacles to the further improvement of Soviet-Bulgarian relations.</p>
<p>Relations with Turkey Have Not Changed</p>
<p>Our relations with Turkey have not changed. As a result of the recent publication of the German White Paper, certain unpleasant activities on the Turkish side have been discovered. Although the French ambassador to Turkey has provided explanations, he has still failed to change the contents of the document. In early April, the Soviet government notified the Turkish side that the Soviet authorities could not tolerate the following fact: in early April, a Turkish aircraft flew over the Baku area, which is full of oil refineries. Initially, the Turkish side completely denied that the aircraft came from Turkish territory. However, in the end, the Turkish side agreed to take steps to prevent similar incidents from happening. After the publication of the German documents, it goes without saying which side the aircraft belonged to. The protests made by the people to the Turkish government are also reasonable.</p>
<p>Strengthen Surveillance of Iran's Attitude</p>
<p>As for Iran, no major events have occurred, but there are also intolerable facts. At the end of March, two aircraft from Iran arrived in the Baku area. Although the Iranian government has denied this, the German White Paper contains a full explanation. We believe that this kind of aircraft activity will inevitably make our relations with the neighboring country more complicated. As a result of this aircraft activity, we will strengthen our surveillance on the southern border in the future.</p>
<p>Relations with Japan May Improve</p>
<p>Recent relations with Japan have begun to take on a normal character. On June 9, an agreement was reached on the exact demarcation of the area of conflict that occurred in the Khalkhin Gol last year. This is extremely important because the delay in resolving this matter has hindered the adjustment of Soviet-Japanese and Mongolian-Manchukuo relations. In a few days, the joint demarcation committee composed of both sides will begin its work. In general, the Japanese side seems to have a tendency to improve relations. If both sides can recognize the need to remove obstacles, then the improvement of Soviet-Japanese relations is not impossible. Although the so-called "new political structure" plan of the new Japanese government is not very clear, the slogan of the Japanese government's southward advance has attracted the attention of the main aspects of Japan, because this aspect is extremely interested in the changes in Europe. Although, in many aspects, their political ambitions are not yet clear. The same is true of Soviet-Japanese relations.</p>
<p>Unwilling to Comment on Soviet-American Relations</p>
<p>Regarding Soviet-American relations, we are unwilling to comment because the situation between the two countries is still lackluster. It is said that some aspects of the United States have expressed dissatisfaction with the Soviet Union's diplomatic victory in the Baltic states. In fact, we do not care about this because we do not need the cooperation of these gentlemen to carry out our work. Although, recently, our National Bank purchased cash from the Baltic states, the US authorities illegally prohibited exports. We must lodge a serious protest against this. Regarding this matter, we can only mention to the British and American governments the great responsibility for their illegal acts. As for our relations with great China, since the signing of the non-aggression pact between the two countries, everything has been extremely friendly. China is now fighting for survival.</p>
<p>The Colonial Issue Is Sharpened</p>
<p>I do not wish to elaborate on our relations with other countries. I will only make a brief statement on international changes. Since the German army won the victory, the European situation has changed, but the time to quickly end the war has not yet arrived. Since Germany won the victory, its national strength has greatly increased. On the other hand, Britain is feeling difficult to continue the war. As for France, since being defeated, it is still encountering a serious crisis. This shift in the strength of power has not only had a major reaction in Europe, but other parts of the world will also be affected.</p>
<p>In addition to France, the defeated countries also include the Netherlands and Belgium. The Netherlands has huge colonies, but its strength is not enough to defend its colonies. Therefore, the issue of redistributing colonies has become more acute.</p>
<p>The desire for imperialism is possessed not only by Japan but also by the United States. In the United States, some people use "concern" as a smokescreen for their imperialist plans. They intend to claim "the entire Western Hemisphere" as their own. As for the colonies of various countries near the American continent, the United States also intends to seize them. All of this is enough to expand the war and make it an imperialist world war.</p>
<p>Strengthen National Power to Prepare for Contingencies</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the Soviet Union has no choice but to consolidate its internal and external position. We have now implemented an eight-hour day and a seven-day week system so that we can carry out the task of strengthening national power, rectifying discipline, and increasing production power.</p>
<p>Although we have achieved considerable success, we are not complacent about this. In order to achieve further victories, we should bear in mind Stalin's words: "We should always be in a state of mobilization and be prepared to deal with any military attack so that all the enemy's tricks cannot be implemented.</p>
<p>"If we bear this in mind, then we will never be taken advantage of by others and will win more glorious victories for the Soviet Union." (TASS dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<h3>British and American Comments on Molotov's Speech</h3>
<p>London. Responsible people here have criticized certain points in the speech made by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov at the opening of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, saying that if, as Molotov claimed, Sir Cripps' appointment as ambassador to the Soviet Union was prompted by a desire to improve British-Soviet relations, then when the Soviet Union expressed its willingness to hold trade negotiations, the British side appointed Cripps as ambassador to the Soviet Union, with full power to continue trade discussions, hoping to gain the cooperation of the Soviet Union. This discussion will produce results and prove to be an important factor in improving general relations. However, in view of Molotov's statement that the British Empire is now preparing to continue the war to gain world hegemony, the British side must declare that the British Empire's continuation of the war is necessary to resist world hegemony. (Reuters dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Washington. After the speech of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov was first transmitted to the United States, an impression arose here that the statement that the Soviet border extended to the Danube was a challenging move against the ambitions of Germany and Italy in the Balkans. As for Molotov's mention of the United States, it is not surprising, but the public feels that it may not be conducive to the success of the talks being held in Washington.

<h3>The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union Passes Six Items on the Agenda, Including the Merger of the Baltic States</h3>
<p>Moscow. The seventh session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union opened today at the Kremlin Palace. The Council of the Union meeting was convened at 2:00 p.m., with the participation of Stakhanovites, representatives of the scientific community, commanders of the Red Army and Navy, deputies, diplomatic corps, and journalists. Then, Andreyev, Chairman of the Council of the Union, Vice-Chairmen Lysenko, Usman, Yusupov, Molotov, Kaganovich, Chutnov, Kroschchev, Chevnik, Malenkov, Sharytov, and deputies of the Supreme Soviet entered the venue one after another. The guests gave them warm cheers. Andreyev, Chairman of the Council of the Union, immediately announced the opening of the meeting and invited Shcherbakov, Chairman of the Secretariat of the Soviet Union, to report on the results of the examination of the election documents of Gubiyev, the representative of the Karelo-Finnish Federal Republic. (Gubiyev is the Deputy of the Council of the Union elected from the Vyborg District.) Finally, it was unanimously recognized that Gubiyev's credentials were mostly authentic. At this point, the Chairman announced the agenda of the Congress as follows:</p>
<p>(2) Report on the Government's Foreign Policy,</p>
<p>(2) The issue of merging the Guta, Anke, and Ismail districts of Northern Bukovina and Bessarabia into the Ukrainian Republic and the establishment of the Moldavian Soviet Republic,</p>

<h3>German Aircraft Bombard London, Drop Bombs in Norwich, and Scatter "Peace" Leaflets Everywhere. British Aircraft Groups Constantly Fly to Bomb Germany</h3>
<p>London. Just after receiving news last night that German aircraft had come from the southeast and southwest of Britain and the northeast of Scotland, groups of German aircraft were seen hovering over various areas of Britain, launching deadly attacks on towns across the country. When attacking the densely populated town of Norwich, German aircraft suddenly descended and strafed residents on the streets with machine guns, killing five and injuring countless others. Afterwards, a German aircraft dropped several incendiary bombs on Norwich, causing several fires. It is generally believed that the city's property losses were enormous. Other air raids were scattered throughout, with minor damage. (International News Agency dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>London. Yesterday afternoon, a German aircraft suddenly emerged from the clouds over the town of Norwich (114 miles northwest of London), descended rapidly to about 400 feet, and dropped bombs, killing five people and injuring several others. One bomb destroyed part of a warehouse, and another bomb hit another house. A bomb hit a restaurant, and the roof was blown off. According to the Ministry of Internal Security, an enemy aircraft flew very high over the east coast in the afternoon. Enemy aircraft activity elsewhere was limited to flying over the English Channel from time to time. Two enemy aircraft were shot down over the English Channel last night, and a British fighter plane that flew out on patrol did not return. (Reuters dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>London. A German aircraft flew to a town in southeastern England yesterday afternoon, bombing and strafing it, causing the windows of shops and houses to be shattered. A fire broke out at one location, with minor casualties. British aircraft took off to pursue. (Reuters dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>London. Last night and this morning, German aircraft launched fierce attacks in the southern and southwestern regions of Britain, dropping bombs and scattering leaflets with "The Last Chance for the British." The content was still the words of Hitler's speech on July 19, namely, "Do you want peace or destruction?" The title of the leaflet was "Hitler's Last Appeal to Reason." While German aircraft were scattering these leaflets, it was also reported from Grenoble that German troops from the Spanish border to the Belgian border had begun to move to the coastal ports of northern France. These leaflets were dropped from aircraft flying at extremely high altitudes. The aircraft were obviously avoiding contact with anti-aircraft balloons and avoiding the illumination of searchlights in order to be able to fly back and forth in the sky during air raid alerts to scatter leaflets. When residents left the air raid shelters and returned home after the alerts were lifted, they saw the roads full of these leaflets. This morning, three or four thousand incendiary bombs were dropped by German aircraft on northern Britain, but no casualties were reported. The Ministry of Aviation also announced that Wales and eastern England had also been attacked, with minor losses and casualties. (United Press dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>London. The Ministry of Aviation announced that British Air Force bombers attacked German military targets and ships off the Dutch and German coasts on Wednesday. Enemy fighters intercepted them and shot down two of them. A British bomber was lost. That night, British aircraft flew to Merschburg, Osnabrück, and Brook to attack oil refineries and storage depots. Ships in the Suda Sea and enemy airfields in the Netherlands and Germany were also bombed. Two British aircraft were lost. Also on Wednesday, an Australian Air Force Sunderland seaplane escorting a convoy repelled several attacks three times. A Coast Command aircraft flying to Norway for reconnaissance did not return.

<h3>The German Blitzkrieg Has Not Yet Begun, Showing a Lack of Confidence in Victory</h3>
<p>Cairo. The Cairo-based non-partisan daily "Al-Mokattam" discussed today the delay in Germany's offensive against the British Isles, saying that Hitler had indeed lost the opportunity to achieve a lightning victory over Britain. The date of the German offensive has been changed repeatedly, and every day that is delayed reduces Hitler's chances of victory and increases Britain's chances of victory. (Reuters dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>Rome. Yesterday, when journalists were received here, someone asked why the various Italian newspapers had different opinions on the current strategy of attacking Britain. The spokesman replied that these were all assumptions of the newspapers themselves. Regarding the "Italian News" Wednesday's statement by Gaida that the attack on Britain would not be as fierce as the attack on France, the spokesman said that Gaida's words could not be regarded as the true strategy of attacking Britain. The attack on Britain is now underway, but do not regard what is published in the newspapers as the mouthpiece of the authorities. (Hai Tong dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<h3>Activities of Libyan Italian Troops Taking on an Offensive Appearance, Italian Ammunition Depot at Bardia Bombed, Flames Rise 500 Feet into the Air</h3>
<p>London - Authoritative sources recently stated that a large number of Italian troops have concentrated on the northern front in Libya, which may be a sign that the Italian troops are taking large-scale offensives. Our troops have gradually advanced towards the Egyptian border and are said to be taking extremely cautious steps to deal with British tanks. (2nd United Press)</p>
<p>Cairo - This morning, the British Air Force here issued a communique saying that British bombers yesterday raided a large ammunition depot near Bardia with great effect. The intensity of the explosion was felt even at altitudes above 2,000 feet. The flames rose as high as 500 feet, and black smoke rose to approximately 7,000 inches. When the British planes flew back, they could still see several plumes of rising black smoke from a distance of forty miles. The British planes suffered no casualties. Italian bombers raided Port Sudan without success. British fighter planes encountered an Italian Caproni bomber over the Abyssinian border. After a short engagement, the Italian plane was shot down. (2nd Reuters)</p>
<p>Cairo - The British Air Force here issued a communique stating that a small squadron of British bombers attacked an oil refinery near Massawa. The bombs scored direct hits, and gasoline caught fire and burned. Black smoke could be seen from fifty miles away. The airfield and hangars at Asmara were also attacked by another squadron of British bombers and suffered heavy damage. All British planes returned safely to their defenses. British planes also raided Golan. Although the cloud cover was very low, hindering accurate bombing, they were still able to hit several targets, causing several fires. To the south of Moyale, the South African Air Force bombed troop concentrations with great effect. (2nd Reuters)</p>
<p>Rome - According to the Italian military headquarters, the British fleet sailing out of Gibraltar, including two battleships, two aircraft carriers per ship, and other warships, although equipped with anti-aircraft guns, were still heavily bombed by the Italian Air Force near the Balearic Islands, hitting one battleship and several other warships. The battleship has already caught fire. One Italian plane did not return. The Italian destroyer "Vivaldi" sank a British submarine last night in the Ionian Sea with depth charges. The submarine was equipped with 30mm caliber gun emplacements and eight torpedo tubes. Of the 55 officers and men on board, 53 were rescued by the Italian ship. In East Africa, Italian aircraft bombed various locations in Sudan. Italian troops in the Kassala area destroyed eight British tanks. Italian troops have occupied Dube, 45 kilometers south of Moyale. Enemy counterattacks have been repelled. British aircraft bombed Dire Dawa without results. British planes attacked Asmara and Massawa, killing one Italian and injuring several others. Two British planes were lost. (2nd Haitong Telegraph)</p>
<p>Berlin - A senior German military officer stated today when issuing a military report that the poor weather in western Germany and Britain continued to hinder the Air Force's actions yesterday, but over the English Channel, above the port of Dover, the German Messerschmitt fighter planes still defeated the British Spitfire fighter planes. Five British planes were shot down, while the German side suffered no losses. Not long ago, Britain claimed that its Spitfires were superior to German planes in terms of speed and combat, but yesterday's air battle proved that its claims were inaccurate. The German planes' actions were concentrated attacks on military targets. The British planes that attacked Hanover last night dropped bombs in the clouds. House number 25 on Schiller Street in the city was destroyed, three were heavily damaged, two people were killed, three were seriously injured, and four were slightly injured. It was investigated that there were no military targets in the vicinity of that street. (2nd Haitong Telegraph)</p>

<h3>Spies Arrested in the Panama Canal Zone, Totaling Eighty-One, Nationalities Not Announced</h3>
<p>Washington - Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson told reporters here yesterday that the United States has detained eighty-one foreign nationals in Panama, "to deport them or subject them to other punishments." He said that these detainees are currently concentrated at immigration stations, but he did not disclose the nationalities of these individuals. Secretary Stimson also said, "No foreign nationals other than Panamanians are employed in the Canal Zone or in advertising. Foreigners previously employed have now been dismissed." Stimson declined to elaborate on the detention of these eighty-one foreign nationals and did not specify whether they were captured by the military or federal commissioners. Stimson stated that the situation in Panama is considered more dangerous by the War Department than anyone else observes. Although authorities in Balboa told the Associated Press that they were unaware of the arrest, it is reported that German, Austrian, and Jewish refugees have been detained at the Balboa Quarantine Station, pending verification of whether they can enter the United States or other Latin American countries. Currently, the only foreign national detained in Balboa is Dr. Waldorf, who was traveling to Santiago, Chile. He was detained on June 2nd for carrying secret codes from the German Consulate in San Francisco into the Panama Canal Zone and was arrested for questioning. Balboa officials said that it is inaccurate to say that only Americans and Panamanians work in the Panama Canal Zone, as there are still 15,000 Black Britons working in the zone. However, the Panama Canal Zone authorities have clearly excluded German, Austrian, and Italian personnel. (2nd United Press)</p>
<h3>Naval Battle in the South Atlantic, One British Ship Damaged, Sails into Bañelos Port for Repairs, Two Crew Members Killed, Seven Injured</h3>
<p>Guinello Port - The British giant auxiliary cruiser "Alcantara" arrived at this port yesterday morning after engaging in a naval battle with a German ship in the South Atlantic on the 31st of last month. The ship suffered heavy damage, and the stern has sunk into the water. (2nd Haitong Agency)</p>
<p>Rio de Janeiro - The British auxiliary cruiser "Dorcancandara," weighing 22,209 tons, docked at Isaltovina yesterday after an engagement with a German raider and will remain there for two or three days for repairs. An Associated Press reporter inspected the ship from a small boat and learned that the ship's armor and guns were not damaged by the German aircraft. According to British officers, the ship was hit during the German air raid but suffered minimal damage. However, two crew members were killed and seven were injured. (2nd Associated Press)</p>
<p>Brazilian Capital - The British armed patrol merchant ship "Alcantara" suffered minor damage in a battle with a German raider near Trinidad Island and arrived here yesterday. It slightly leaned to the left as it passed through the bay and entered the dry dock. According to responsible sources, the Brazilian government has allowed the "Alcantara" to remain docked until repairs are completed, as the engine room was damaged and cannot sail out without repairs. Details of the battle are not yet known. The British Admiralty announced that "the 'Alcantara' sank the German raider and suffered minor damage while pursuing and attacking after the German ship released smoke." The German official news agency stated that the German auxiliary cruiser that encountered the "Alcantara" has resumed its merchant ship raiding activities. (3rd Reuters)</p>
<p>Guinello Port - After the British giant auxiliary cruiser "Alcantara" was damaged in a naval battle with a German ship in the South Atlantic and sailed into this port yesterday morning, the Brazilian authorities have now allowed it to remain in the port for 24 hours. According to the neutral country government's previous permission for warships of belligerent countries to stay in port for 24 hours, the British ambassador to Brazil has requested the Brazilian authorities to extend the stay due to the heavy damage to the "Alcantara" and the impossibility of completing the repairs in a short time. The ship is now guarded by foreign police in the port, and no one other than official representatives is allowed to board or disembark. It is understood that two British soldiers were killed and seven were seriously injured and have left the ship. The remaining twenty-three slightly injured remain on board. (2nd Haitong Agency)</p>
<p>London - The German "Popular Newspaper" of July 17th published an article stating that the penetrating power of British incendiary bombs is stronger than usually estimated, and the range and penetrating power of explosive bomb fragments are also not as low as estimated. The destructive power of the fragments that cause death and destruction is truly unbelievable. We have seen fragments as large as fists penetrate an oak door and two layers of thick iron on a safe. Even thick walls cannot withstand them. The nightly air raids by British planes cause unbearable nervous tension. The newspaper published an article on July 14th, titled "The Bombing of Hamburg," stating briefly that it has become a habit to take refuge in air raid shelters every night. People are surprised if there are no British air raids and speculate about the reason for the peaceful night. Another newspaper on July 17th stated that there is hardly a night without enemy planes flying high and dropping bombs on Germany. (2nd Reuters)</p>

<p>Rome - Germany is now vigorously supporting Hungary's demands regarding Outer Transylvania, making it difficult for the Gigurtu government to cope. There is now a possibility of organizing a "central" government, which will seek to conduct new negotiations with Germany and, on the other hand, inquire with the Soviet Union whether the Soviet Union is willing to help Romania if Germany insists on not giving way. Former National Peasant Party leader Maniu is gradually emerging and intends to call on the country to resist Hungary's land demands. His program includes being pro-Soviet and restoring normal relations with Britain, Turkey, and Yugoslavia. (2nd Reuters)</p>

The "Central Daily News" recounted the circumstances of Cox's tragic death and later stated that Cox had served in the press for nearly forty years, most of which he spent in the Far East. He had many friends in the Chinese press, both known and unknown, who respected him as a loyal journalist. Journalists all over the world will surely protest after expressing their regret for Cox's tragic death and demand a thorough investigation of the case. After speculating on the reasons for Japan's actions, the newspaper continued, "After Britain closed the Burma Road, Japan took the opportunity to continue to put pressure on Britain and the United States. Some say that Japan's high-pressure tactics against British expatriates in Japan may be the result of Britain's recent capitulation." The "Ta Kung Pao's" commentary was frank and direct, titled "Commemorating Our Comrade Journalist Cox." It stated, "We dare say that Japan's accusation of Cox as a spy is completely unfounded, for the reasons being: (1) Everyone knows that Japan would never allow national secrets to fall into the hands of foreign journalists; (2) Britain has no ambitions towards Japan and has no right in Japan, so there is no need to obtain any secret information; (3) Cox, as an experienced journalist in the press, has always had a reputation for integrity and would never engage in any disreputable actions."

<h3>The World's Most Luxurious Pawnshop</h3>
<p>Foreigners who have resided in the capital of Argentina for a short time invariably ask Argentinians, "What is that place called 'Casa De Ventas'? Is it a department store?"</p>
<p>Argentinians find it hard to answer this question enough. It turns out that the magnificent Casa De Ventas is a municipal pawnshop, but on the surface, it looks like a department store. In fact, it is a novel form of commerce. Its headquarters and six branches employ over 1,100 people, and its business aims to benefit the people. Among the pawned items it lends against, there are as many as 10,000 sewing machines and 2,500 pianos, which shows the scale of its operations. It also lends to various cities to help them build roads and repay debts. In 1934, it lent 21 million pesos to the city government of the Argentine capital, equivalent to about US$4,830,000.</p>
<p>Ordinary pawnshops in foreign countries are usually located in narrow alleys, nothing more than a dirty little house, with old watches and other sundries piled up in the display window. People would never want to step into a pawnshop unless they were at their wit's end.</p>
<p>But it is not so in the capital of Argentina. The pawnshop there is managed by the municipal government. Citizens enter and leave the pawnshop as if they were entering a bank, dignified and without shame. It does its best to serve the poor citizens.</p>
<p>This pawnshop is located in the city center, in a refined five-story new building. Unredeemed pawned items are displayed publicly for several days before the auction. There are several display windows, arranged in a semi-circle, with neat and elegant decorations, comparable to a department store.</p>
<p>For example, one display window is decorated as a dining room, displaying beautiful tables and chairs, bowls and plates, paintings, and electric clocks, with small labels attached, indicating the number and minimum bid price. Other display windows display various radios, leather goods, typewriters, and musical instruments, all arranged spaciously and pleasingly, in an orderly manner.</p>
<p>The most interesting figure in the auction room is a type of agent. If you cannot go to the venue to shop in person, you only need to pay a five-cent handling fee and a 20% deposit. An agent will bid on your behalf during the auction, up to the price you have secretly pre-determined. The deal may be closed even if it does not reach the price you specified.</p>
<p>There is another convenience for customers who buy goods. If you want to buy a certain item but do not see it on display, you only need to leave your name and phone number, and you will be notified when the item is available for sale. This kind of service is truly a win-win for both the pawner and the buyer. Buyers can buy what they want at will, without inconvenience or wasting time. The pawnshop sells the pawned items, deducts the interest due from the profits, and returns the remaining funds to the original owner of the pawned item.</p>
<p>The Bustling Pawnshop in the Capital of Argentina</p>
<p>At the corner of this pawnshop, facing a small square, is an appraisal room, with a constant stream of people entering and leaving. It is common for citizens of the capital of Argentina to pawn items. It can be said that they live by borrowing money. Whether purchasing clothing, shoes, or even cars, they all pay in installments. They are fond of spending lavishly, so they have to turn to this municipal pawnshop for help.</p>
<p>Ordinary citizens enter the appraisal room calmly, just like entering other public places. The appraisal room is also as polite to the pawners as ordinary shops are to customers, asking them to wait in a small room, while the staff takes the items to be pawned to the appraiser. The original owner of the pawned item and the appraiser never meet, to prevent collusion. Once the appraisal is completed, the pawner leaves with the money, never arguing about the amount, knowing that the pawn money obtained will definitely be more than at other private pawnshops.</p>
<p>This pawnshop accepts any kind of pawned item, and there is no limit to the loan amount. It once accepted a diamond, with a pawn of as much as 120,000 pesos (equivalent to US$27,600). It also once accepted an airplane, which it later had to sell for about ten yuan. Many wedding dresses are pawned, but wedding rings are not easily pawned unless one is completely impoverished. Many sewing machines are also pawned. To save storage space and for the convenience of the original owner, this pawnshop often allows the original owner to keep the sewing machine for use.</p>
<p>This pawnshop is often called the cloakroom of the capital of Argentina, because some people pawn clothes simply to store them.</p>
<p>Some people have been paying interest on pawned items for more than ten years. Once, a woman pawned a piano, which had been there for 25 years. The pawnshop management decided to return it to the original owner. No small number of telescopes are pawned. It turns out that some people lose at horse racing, pawn their telescopes on Sunday, get their weekly salary on Saturday, and then redeem them to watch the races as usual. However, not everyone who is addicted to horse racing can redeem their pawned items. For example, a certain laundress pawned a shirt entrusted to her by a customer, lost a lot of money betting on horses, and when the customer asked for the shirt, she actually gave the pawn ticket to the customer to redeem it themselves.</p>
<p>However, all employees of this pawnshop are not allowed to enter the racetrack. They receive generous salaries and various benefits for a stable and happy life. For example, if the monthly salary is not 104 yuan, they receive a subsidy of 100 pesos (equivalent to US$23) for each child born, and are also given a baby carriage and clothing.</p>
<p>Since its establishment in 1878, this pawnshop has faithfully fulfilled its mission of serving the public. Now it is actively engaged in charitable work, drawing lots each year to return winter clothes and blankets pawned by the poor. In 1938, it funded the construction of tuberculosis sanatoriums and outpatient clinics for hospitals to benefit the poor and sick. People in South America call it a pawnshop with a conscience, which it truly deserves.</p>
<h3>Abundant Water in Northern Jiangsu and the Lower Reaches of Rivers; Xingdong Ferry Resumes Service; Rice Prices Also Decline</h3>
<p>Taixian Correspondent: Due to the previous drought and lack of rain in various counties of Northern Jiangsu, the rivers in the lower reaches dried up, making it impossible to irrigate farmland and draw water. It was decided to open the Baojia Dam to divert water from the Yangtze River into the lower reaches. Recently, with continuous heavy rain, the farmland has been sufficiently watered, and the water volume in the lower reaches has increased. On the 25th, the township chiefs of Taixian County led civilians to block the dam. Also, because the water levels in the upper and lower reaches of the Taixian River were low, transportation was inconvenient. As a result, the ferry services on various lines were forced to stop. Recently, with continuous heavy rain and a sudden rise in the Huai River, the water levels in the upper and lower reaches have increased. To facilitate transportation, various ferry companies have begun to resume services. In addition to the Xing (Hua) Tai (Xian) ferry, which was the first to resume service on the 24th, the Tai (Xian) Dong (Tai) ferry continued to resume service on the 26th. The ferries to Haian, Taixing, and other places will also resume service within the next few days.</p>
<p>Another report: After continuous rain in Taixian County, the source of rice in the lower reaches has been abundant. On the 24th, the price of rice was 26 yuan, which was two or three yuan lower than before. On the 25th, due to the entry of new rice into the market, the number of old rice sold was also greater than in the past. As a result, the price of rice fell sharply. The current price of high-quality rice is 25 yuan per stone, medium-quality rice is 24 yuan, and low-quality rice is 23 yuan. The output of new rice is still good, with a market price of 20 yuan per stone. According to people in the land and grain industry, if various grains are no longer smuggled out of the country, there is still a possibility of a large drop in prices.</p>

<h3>Guangxi Provincial Government Formulates Measures for Middle School Students' Service; Graduation Certificates Will Only Be Issued to Those Who Pass; Service for Two Years Guarantees Admission to Senior High School or Normal School</h3>
<p>(Guilin Telegram) Guangxi Province is implementing universal national education, which requires a large number of teachers. To remedy the shortage of teachers and to supervise students who have completed the early stage of their studies in public and private junior middle schools to serve in national primary schools to meet the urgent needs of universal national education and to increase their social service experience, the Provincial Government has specially formulated the "Implementation Measures for Students Who Have Completed the Early Stage of Studies in Junior Middle Schools and National Middle Schools in Guangxi Province to Serve in National Education." It stipulates that all public and private junior middle schools in the province must set up teacher training courses in the third academic year in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Education, and national middle schools must strengthen teacher training and education services in the second academic year. After passing the graduation examination, all students who do not take the senior high school entrance exam must serve in a designated county's national primary school for one semester in the next academic year. Students of county-run schools should serve in their home county or the county where the middle school is located. Students of provincial schools should serve in the counties in the district where they are located. Students assigned to serve should not request changes without compelling reasons and must report to the school for work before the start of the school year. The students serving this time will be assigned to serve as substitute teachers in national primary schools at all levels, and full-time positions will be the principle. Living expenses will be determined by each county in accordance with the salary standards of teachers in the county. Travel expenses for arrival and departure will be issued by the province. Each middle school should form a service student guidance committee to guide and assess students. After the service period expires, the county government will conduct a thorough examination of the service. Those who pass will be given a service certificate, and those who fail will have their service extended for one semester until they pass. Graduation certificates will only be issued by the original school in accordance with regulations after passing the service performance. Those who have not yet received a certificate and wish to continue their studies may take the exam with a service certificate. Those who wish to continue serving may directly report to the county government where they serve or the county government of their origin to request priority employment. Those who serve for more than two years with excellent results may be guaranteed admission to the senior high school normal school without examination for further study and may participate in the elementary school teacher examination and certification.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Formulates Curriculum Standards for Central Schools</h3>
<p>After the implementation of national education in various regions, the Ministry of Education decided to formulate separate curriculum standards for the adult classes, women's classes, and the national school, in the central school, to meet the needs. It invited many experts in people's education to discuss and formulate a set of interim curriculum standards, which have now been formulated and promulgated. The Textbook Editing Committee of the Ministry of Education is now working on editing textbooks. Before these new textbooks are completed, the textbooks needed for the adult classes, women's classes and national school in each region's central school and other types of school are to temporarily apply the type B textbook edited by the Ministry of Education for the public school.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Rewards Vocational School Teachers for Further Studies</h3>
<p>General subject teachers in vocational schools are to participate in summer training and discussion meetings for teachers of various subjects in general secondary schools to further their studies. However, the further studies of vocational subject teachers will be handled separately by the education departments of each province. In the middle of the month, the Ministry of Education sent a telegram urging the departments to quickly handle the case of rewarding vocational school teachers of vocational subjects for further studies and report it for approval by the deadline.</p>
<h3>News from the Department of Education of Zhejiang University</h3>
<p>(Zunyi Correspondent) The Department of Education of National Zhejiang University was established quite early, at the beginning of the establishment of the University in the 17th year of the Republic of China. It was initially affiliated with the College of Arts and Sciences. Because there were not many students, it was combined with the Department of Chinese and the Department of English into the first group. The following year, Zheng Zonghai, Meng Xiancheng, and Yu Ziyi were hired to teach at the school. Zheng also served as the head of the department. After the 19th year, two doctors, Huang Yi and Shen Yougan, arrived successively. All courses such as education and psychology were gradually opened and a large number of psychological instruments, charts, and testing materials were purchased, and a psychological laboratory was established. In the 22nd year, Professor Meng resigned, and Dr. Zhuang Zexuan, director of the Institute of Education of Sun Yat-sen University, was hired to take office. Since then, domestic and foreign educational and psychological books and newspapers have been collected, and a library has been opened for students to read and refer to freely. A training institute was also established to test the process of children's behavioral development and the methods of guidance and treatment. From the 23rd year, the department was divided into education and psychology groups, allowing students to choose to study according to their inclinations. In the autumn of the 25th year, Zhu Kezhen was appointed president of Zhejiang University, and Zheng Xiaocang was appointed provost. The head of the department was changed to Zhuang Zexuan concurrently. Later, the War of Resistance began, and the school moved west, going through three or four places before it was slightly settled. Many professors also moved elsewhere. Director Zhuang Zexuan went to Hong Kong to lecture, and Professor Meng was appointed to succeed him. Soon Meng left, and Professor Huang acted as the director again. Lei Peihong, Zhang Gunian, and Jiang Zhenjun once served as professors in the department. In the autumn of the 28th year, President Zhu successively hired Chen Li, Hu Jiajian (concurrently director of the Experimental Middle School), Li Xiangxu (concurrently director of the Normal College), Jiang Qi (concurrently director of University Training), Chen Jianxiao (concurrently director of University Training), and Peng Baichuan (concurrently director of the first grade) from Chongqing, Shanghai, Kunming, Guilin, and other places to be professors. Because Huang Yi resigned from his concurrent position as acting head of the department, Chen Jianxiao was appointed to succeed him. At this time, the department began to restore its former scale and was moving towards normal education and academic research, in order to create good teachers for secondary schools, local educational administrative cadres, and a small number of people who continued to study educational psychology. Fortunately, the original instruments, charts, books, and magazines from England, America, and Germany are still abundant, and there was not much loss after they were taken out. They are still being supplemented. In Zunyi, where the school is located, houses have been rented as laboratories, and professors guide students to conduct research on school systems, training, statistics, testing, teaching materials and methods for primary and secondary schools, and to conduct experiments on child psychology, learning processes, and emotional development. All of the above have been arranged, and the work has made considerable progress. Although the equipment has not been improved due to wartime funding and time constraints, the department is striving to adapt to the environment with its inherent good foundation and the efforts of current teachers and students. Currently, the department has seven professors, one lecturer, three teaching assistants, and fifty-seven students. About seventy graduates have worked in various educational institutions in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Hong Kong, and Chongqing with remarkable results. Four students will graduate this summer and have been introduced to work. However, in the autumn of the 27th year, the school was ordered by the Ministry of Education to add a Normal College. From that year, the students recruited by the department were assigned to the Normal College, and those recruited in the past were still assigned to the College of Arts. The department is affiliated with the two colleges and complements each other. In the future, the department will be responsible for providing educational subjects to the Chinese, English, history, geography, mathematics, physics, and chemistry departments of the Normal College, and for guiding primary and secondary education in Guizhou and Guangxi. Dean Mei Guangdi of the College of Arts and Dean Wang of the Normal College both have rich knowledge and experience in education, and Director Chen is also an expert in education. There is no doubt that they will be able to work together to develop the department.</p>

<h3>Finance　The Statutory Exchange Rate for the Pound Sterling Remains Unchanged, Commercial Exchange Rate Slightly Adjusted, Changed from the Original Seven Pence to Four and a Half Pence</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: HSBC's exchange rates remained unchanged. The black market rates for the British and American currencies turned tighter and softer again. Due to a telegram from Chongqing, the Ministry of Finance revised the commercial exchange rate to four and a half pence, leading to a misunderstanding that the legal tender's exchange rate against foreign currencies had decreased. In reality, the Central Bank's listed rates remained unchanged. What has been adjusted this time is the commercial exchange rate of the Bank of Communications of China, which is used for the settlement of exchange for fourteen categories of export goods. Since the government's control of foreign exchange, the export of local goods has always been stipulated to be settled at seven pence with the Bank of Communications of China, while the actual black market exchange rate often fluctuates between three and a half pence and four pence, with an excessively large difference. Those who suffer losses naturally belong to the export merchants. Now, in order to take care of the exporters, the government ordered the Bank of Communications of China to reduce the commercial exchange rate to four and a half pence, only changing the unit of calculation for settlement of exchange. Not only can it encourage exports, but it can also restrict the import of non-essential goods. As for the original value of the legal tender, it has not changed. This can be seen from the fact that the Central Bank's foreign exchange rates have not changed at all yesterday. Moreover, the cash reserve for the amount of legal tender issued still maintains the original statutory ratio. In addition, Jones of the US Reconstruction Bank formally announced that China still has US$22 million in credit loans. It can be seen that the foundation of the legal tender is more solid than imagined. Therefore, although speculators were active everywhere yesterday, pouring out nearly one million US dollars, all banks, including the Central Bank, British Bank, and American Bank, sold them, and the price once softened to US$5.8125 and the British pound softened to 3 pence 8125. Soon, news came from Hong Kong, and foreign banks were willing to supply, and it rebounded slightly, eventually softening again. The closing price was 3 pence 8125 for spot British pounds, US$5.84375, British tight .0625, US tight .125. Futures were only slightly tighter. Swaps have been squared off, and trading was quite active.</p>
<p>Exchange Rates Once Sharply Tightened</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London big strip fell .0625, the forward price remained unchanged, the New York silver price remained the same, and the London gold price was fixed.

<h3>In Order to Reset the Commercial Exchange Rate, the Gold Market Rise Re-emerges</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the black market for cash silver ingots in this city rose again. In the chaos, the price has exceeded the 5,500 yuan mark. The reason is that the Chongqing telegram reported that the Central Ministry of Finance reset the commercial exchange rate of the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications to 4 and a half pence for the legal tender against the British pound. The people of this city were temporarily stimulated, and foreign exchange suddenly tightened, so the buying trend that had just subsided was reignited. The opening price in the morning rose to 5,480 yuan. When foreign exchange stopped tightening and rebounded, small private banks and gold shops poured out, and then fell, seeing a low price of 5,430 yuan. Soon foreign exchange tightened again, and the buying trend became fierce again. Gold shops, small private banks, retail investors, etc. re-entered, and the price exceeded 5,500 yuan outside the noon moment. A certain jewelry store also entered the market in the afternoon, and the price rose to a high of 5,575 yuan. Unexpectedly, the foreign exchange heard that the Hong Kong telegram supplied it, and it suddenly stopped tightening. Many parties poured out, and it once fell sharply by 90 yuan, entering within 5,500 yuan. It finally rose again with foreign exchange, and the closing price was 5,525 yuan, which was 120 yuan higher. The total transaction volume for the whole day was more than 4,000 taels. The price of jewelry gold rose by 10 yuan to 570 yuan. The customs gold and other items were all flat.</p>
<p>Silver Ingots Rose by One Hundred Nian Yuan</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the morning, each bar (ten taels) was initially due to the report that Chongqing reduced the commercial exchange rate, so although the exchange rate between the US dollar and the British pound reported a increase of 5 points, the people's hearts were quite firm. The opening price actually jumped 75 yuan, and money exchange businesses entered the silver shop with ten taels at 5,480 yuan. Because the exchange market tightened and then suddenly loosened, money exchange businesses and silver shops immediately competed to sell, and soon fell back 50 yuan. Silver shops sold gold shops ten taels, less than 5,430 yuan. Then the selling trend was slightly frustrated, and gold shops suddenly came to absorb, and suddenly increased by 30 yuan. Gold shops entered silver shops with fifty taels at 5,460 yuan. However, after that, a certain gold shop suddenly came to sell fiercely, the amount was not small, and it was repressed to 5,440 yuan. However, soon a certain money exchange business suddenly came to absorb, and at that time, the sellers decreased, and retail investors followed suit, and in a moment, it rushed out of the 5,500 yuan mark. Silver shops made ten taels each, rising to 5,515 yuan. Later, the surplus was profitable and spit out, once returning to the edge of the 5,500 yuan mark. However, in the end, because a certain gold shop needed to cover the short very much, the high price of 5,530 yuan was seen again, and the closing price was 5,520 yuan. The opening conditions in the afternoon were quite good, jumping 20 yuan, and the gold shop entered the silver shop with twenty taels at 5,540 yuan. Following the progress of gold shops and silver shops, it continued to rise by 35 yuan, and the gold shop entered the silver shop with ten taels, which was 5,575 yuan. Then, a certain silver shop suddenly suppressed the price and sold it forcefully, and gold shops and securities gangs scrambled to sell it. In addition, a certain money exchange business had a large number of bulls come out soon after, and it once forced into the 5,500 yuan mark. Gold shops sold the securities gang ten taels, and the waves were 5,485 yuan. Later, because the people's hearts were still firm, there were many buyers at low prices, and relying on a certain gold shop to transfer the sale into a purchase, and then rose to 5,525 yuan at the closing price. As a result, it rose by 120 yuan compared with the previous day. The whole day was up and down by 145 yuan. The selling price of the current gold of the cash shop was more than ten yuan higher than the silver ingot, and the intake was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and it was rarely opened.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Listed at Ten Yuan</p>
<p>The exchange of jewelry gold per tael in jewelry stores: Initially, Datonghang still suspended 560 yuan. It was not until 11:30 that it was suspended at 10 yuan higher. After that, there was no change. It is estimated that Datonghang changed to suspend 570 yuan. The new line was the same as the above price, and the revenue was reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea　Export Stagnation　Shanghai Silk Market Rises</h3>
<p>Recently, the overseas silk market can be described as extremely dull. The spot price in Yokohama is 1,350 yuan, which has remained unchanged for ten days. The forward price has risen slightly, 11 yuan higher than the previous day. The market atmosphere in New York is the same. In the past few days, the daily turnover of the New York Stock Exchange has only been 40% to 50%. In terms of market prices, it showed an increase yesterday. It is estimated that the near-term rose by 3 and a half points, and the far-term rose by 4 and a half points. The foreign firms in Shanghai, the British and French firms, were as silent as ever. A certain foreign firm continued to absorb and purchase. The 6th grade of Qili was sold at 2,525 yuan, which was 50 yuan higher than before. The transaction volume reached nearly 100 dans.</p>
<h3>Grain　Nearly 30,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Newly Arrived　Rice Prices Once Rose and Then Fell Back</h3>
<p>A large amount of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai again yesterday. It is estimated that the British ship St. Vincent Depul, managed by the Central Transportation Company, transported 16,251 bags from Saigon. It arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and docked at Pier 15, Bund, Beijing Road for unloading. It is scheduled to be completed last night. In addition, the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Laisheng ship transported 6,092 bags from Haiphong and 617 bags from Hong Kong. The Yusheng ship also transported 1,907 bags from Hong Kong.

It is estimated that the four ships loaded rice to Shanghai, totaling 29,885 bags. (Zu)</p>
<p>The current foreign rice market seems to have turned to a hovering path. After rising and falling once in the past two days, the rising trend was re-enacted yesterday. Although the buying and selling in the early market still inherited the fatigue of the previous day, the local gangs suddenly took action to select cheap lower-grade goods because of the passport relationship. Once this was active, the sellers immediately followed the wind and turned the rudder. In an instant, the situation became tighter, attracting the general sales who were watching and successively advancing, and thinking about transactions and changing with the opportunity. The wind assisted the waves, and it was actively allowed. Therefore, in the state of constant promotion and agitation by all parties in the market, it felt more concentrated, and the prices of various goods increased in each section in the shouting. As a result, the closing price had risen by 1 to 2 yuan compared with the previous market. It is estimated that the No. 1 Chen Saigon has reached 56 yuan and a half, and the new pointed rice is 55 yuan. However, even so, the actual sales were not greedy, and the local customers did not have a smooth transformation. In addition, the inventory was congested, and the late arrivals were endless, and they did not dare to buy to their heart's content. The market fell by 40 to 50 cents again, and finally it was only half a yuan to one yuan better. At the time when the current rice rose in the early market, the No. 2 Saigon was opened to 59 yuan and a half, but the number of incoming households was not strong, and there were people taking advantage of the high prices to spit it out. The closing price also fell slightly by 20 cents from 59 yuan 34 cents to 59 yuan. The opening price of Siam Siam No. 2 was also 59 yuan and a half, and the closing price also fell back slightly by 20 cents to 59 yuan 30 cents. In short, the market inventory is substantial, there are not many actual sales, and the market will eventually be difficult to recover too much. 200 tons of returned original bags have been opened, and 7,000 bags of current rice have been opened.</p>
<p>The national glutinous rice has been out of stock for a long time, and the inventory is declining, but because foreign glutinous rice has been squeezed out, the foot is relatively soft. Now, after foreign glutinous rice has been sold out repeatedly, the base cargo has also become scarce, and the sales have increased sharply, resulting in an uneven supply and demand situation. Rare things are expensive, so it is extremely tight and valuable, and the price is about 2 yuan higher. Kaijin Litie is 59 yuan, Changdanbai is 567 yuan, Hong Kong is 58 yuan and a half, and Juezhi is 567 yuan.</p>
<p>Although the arrival of thick and thin japonica and other national rice is not always constant, the plate is expensive, and the distance from foreign rice is far away, so it is rumored that there are only some scattered appetites in the off-market transactions, and the selling price is difficult to be as good as foreign rice, which can be called a fixed situation. It is said that everything is similar to the previous plate.</p>
<h3>Japanese Flour Shouts High, Wheat Prices Also Rise</h3>
<p>Flour: The factory plate still maintained the original price of 15 yuan yesterday. Local customers had scattered embellishments. The market foot has gradually stabilized. It is found that Japanese factory flour has been devalued repeatedly, which has aroused the attention of the general poor. The price of wheat has been slightly higher in recent days, and the sales have moved slightly. The cargo side shouted up immediately. The August Phoenix brand initially opened at 14 yuan, and then rose to 14 yuan and 20 cents. September has reached 14 yuan and 50 cents, with a transaction of about 3,000 bags. The rising trend in the market is quite strong, and the local flour is also firm with the market. It is heard that the Double Lion brand is also sold for 14 yuan and 50 cents, but there is no formal transaction.</p>
<p>Wheat: Because the production prices in the inland areas of Su and Xi have risen yesterday, the Japanese factory's appetite seems to have become more active, and the cargo side's thinking has become more firm, and it is holding on tightly. The transaction was very rare yesterday, and the market price has risen by 50 to 60 cents. The Chinese factory's price is collected secretly, and 2,000 to 3,000 bags are collected every day. The purchase price is also about half a yuan higher than before.</p>
<h3>Securities　National Debt Sees Both Rise and Fall</h3>
<p>The securities noon plate: The market turned slightly weak again yesterday, and trading decreased accordingly. The people's hearts in the market are still very firm, and many parties continue to buy, and have not stopped. For example, No. 20 has always been buying Grade E yesterday, and the demand for Grade A is more common. It has been stipulated that the tenth lottery will be held on the 10th of this month. This lottery is for 28 branches, which is 2 branches more than the last time. The chance of winning the lottery is easier. Although the cost is higher, the rights are naturally more. For example, Songmao, Yongkang, Hengfu, and the general retail investors are particularly interested in Grade A. Those who bought large amounts before have never been seen to sell them. There may be an abnormal development in the future. The sellers in the market include Xinchang, Hongda, Lianyi, Tongkang, and Zhongxin, who have all sold out. However, the buyers are not weak, so as a result, Grade B is still 5 points better, and the rest are consistently reduced by 5 points, 10 cents to 25 cents. The total transaction volume was more than 800,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 100 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 11 yuan and 30 cents.</p>
<p>Although the trading volume of the Public Chamber of Commerce this week is small, the surplus settlement in the last five minutes is still unavoidable. However, the absorption power of many parties is very strong, and the market conditions at the closing price are extremely strong. Rubber stocks are the most prominent. Yingzhahua and Langgezhi have made progress. The closing price of the former is 35 yuan 25, and the latter is 25 yuan 25. The Yihua stock has been in good demand all day, and the transaction volume of the British Associated stock is also huge.</p>
<p>London, 1st (Thursday) telegram: Today's board of foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks are listed. Bank stocks are tending to fall. It is estimated that the stock of McCallum Bank has fallen back by 1 shilling and 3 pence, and the price is 6 pounds 18 shillings and 9 pence. The stocks of HSBC have fallen by 2 pounds each. The stock registered in London is 63 pounds, and the stock registered in Hong Kong is 66 pounds. The stock of Gulake Linbang Rubber is the only one that has risen by 1 shilling and 3 pence, and the price is 15 shillings. The rest are unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton　Double Horse Yarn Once Breaks the Thousand Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>The yarn market is tending to be firm, and the rising trend has risen slightly. This is because the Ministry of Finance announced the new exchange rate of legal tender against the British pound to be 4 and a half pence. The people's hearts were temporarily agitated, and the buying sentiment was strong. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose above the 1,000 yuan mark. Unexpectedly, the actual transaction was still bleak and lifeless. At the same time, a certain long side suddenly came out in secret when the rising trend was on. As a result, the table was relaxed, and the market fell back again.</p>
<p>The spot yarn opened in the morning, and the investment and buying sentiment was active due to the tightening of the market and the high price of gold. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,000 yuan, an increase of 20 yuan. The atmosphere was enthusiastic for a while, and the shouting was as chaotic as hemp, making it to 1,008 yuan. Unexpectedly, the long side of the big account came out in large quantities. At the same time, the bill of exchange was slightly weak. At this point, the chips fell off, and the market price fell back to 990 yuan quickly. The closing price rebounded slightly. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 1,800 packages were traded. The market price of 20-count Double Horse yarn increased by 14 yuan. Today, 1,835 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Hong Kong. The amount of purchases by each gang is listed below:</p>
<p>Colleagues 1,435 Hong Kong 265</p>
<p>Tianjin 1001 Statistics 1800</p>
<h3>Cotton Mills Need to Be Continuous</h3>
<p>Although there are no wholesale developments in the spot cotton trade, the mills still need to be continuous in small amounts. In addition, the foreign exchange has been reduced, which has improved the people's hearts, so the market is firmer. The transaction situation of spot cotton is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Dazhonghua 207.00 Hongzhang entered 133 pieces</p>
<p>Brazilian cotton 226.00 Shener Mill entered 300 pieces</p>
<p>Huocaobao 151.00 Xieshen entered 155 packages</p>
<p>Dazhongji 202.00 Chengde entered 133 packages</p>
<p>Another news about the market price of foreign cotton: the market situation in the New York cotton market is extremely dull, and all parties are holding a wait-and-see attitude. Wall Street is also very quiet. As a result, the closing price fell by 23 pounds compared with the previous day. The Indian cotton market was closed yesterday, and the forecast was unchanged.</p>
<p>Although the foreign exchange tightened yesterday, the trade of foreign cotton in Shanghai did not stimulate the people's hearts. The cotton yarn was stagnant due to the actual sales, so there was no trade in cotton. The stock in the market is becoming less and less, especially the long fiber is the most. Therefore, the public opinion is that the cotton market will have a turnaround.</p>
<h3>Oil Cake　Soybean Cake Falls Back Slightly</h3>
<p>Oil cake has not been much changed this week due to the lack of new stimulus. However, soybean cake was once strong, but the road to go was not wide, so the potential is still less amazing, and the market has been slightly reduced yesterday, only 700 pieces of Shenji cake were opened, the price was 11 yuan 10 cents, and one car of Yuanlong cake, the price was 10 yuan 70 cents. The price of raw soybean oil rose and fell each other, and the range was also ordinary, so the overall situation was no different from lingering. Yesterday, 350 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were handled by Guangdong gangs, Hong Kong, the mainland, and this road, and the price was 63 yuan, 50 pieces of Yantai raw oil, the price was 62 yuan 50 cents, and 140 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, the price was 92 yuan 50 cents, and 20 barrels of Pudong soybean oil, the price was 71 yuan. Today, 1,160 packages of soybeans and 1,280 listens of raw oil are transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods　Cloth Mills Prepare to Resume Work</h3>
<p>Recently, the cloth market has been dominated by customer sales and activity of hoarders. Due to the general shutdown and reduction of work in cloth mills, the mill's inventory is gradually thinning. Many mills are actively preparing to resume work. The cost of new goods will increase due to the rise in the price of raw yarn, so the market is showing a turnaround. Yesterday's white goods selling plate increased by 25 cents to 50 cents per piece, and the bleached and dyed cloths also increased by about 50 cents. The local printing and dyeing factory has a sharp increase in the need for various grey cloths. The wholesale number slightly handled about 600 pieces of coarse cloth and bleached and dyed cloth.

Fine cloth rises by 1 yuan to 1 yuan 30 cents per piece, and fine twill rises by 50 cents to 70 cents and a half per piece. The closing price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth is 30 yuan 07 and a half cents, and the closing price of Four Gentlemen serge is 91 cents per yard. The Tianjin gang purchased more than 300 pieces of fine cloth, and the local industry is very firm and the amount of advance is very large.</p>
<h3>Autumn and Winter Woolen Fabrics Are Still Firm</h3>
<p>The market conditions of woolen fabrics are still weak. The trend of various goods for autumn and winter sales, such as horse riding breeches, Tosca velvet, single-sided floral velvet, pullover floral velvet, Melton, plain thick velvet, shoe velvet, Zhan velvet, wide and tight camel velvet, long-haired velvet, short-haired velvet, Harris, men's and women's colored coats, etc., is stable, but the transaction is far less than the first half of the month. This is because the selling price is high, and the prices of various goods continue to decline.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market　Ersi Coarse White　Guangdong Gang Continues to Advance More Than 1,000 Packages</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market: Because the new exchange rate was announced, the British and American exchange rates were reduced, and the people's hearts turned better.

For example, jellyfish skin has risen to 60 yuan, and the stock is about to be sold out. The price of jellyfish head is 50 yuan, and the price of Ningbo squid is 80 yuan. The market goods have been collected. The price of local goods has risen by 20 to 30 yards and has been sold for more than 145 yuan. It was quoted at 150 yuan yesterday.</p>
<h3>Coal　Tongdeli Lump Soars</h3>
<p>Tongdeli white coal had been falling step by step in the black market last week due to the large number of sales by owners. Recently, the sales in this street have gradually shown a turnaround. Street customers intend to collect them, and the cargo owners refuse to sell them, temporarily watching and waiting. The spot goods in the market suddenly feel scarce, and the market plate immediately soars. It is estimated that the Tongdeli screened lump is 180 yuan per ton, and the unified coal is 170 yuan, delivered to the customer's home, including the handling.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials　Coix Seed Has Lively Demand</h3>
<p>Coix seed has a sweet taste and is a product for removing dampness in summer, so the sales at this time are quite lively, and it is best to have a white color and no moths.

<h3>Three Cases of Violence Occurred at the Same Time Yesterday Morning: White Russian Leader Metzler Was Brutally Murdered; Shen Jinzhou, Manager of Yitaixing, Was Kidnapped; Failed Kidnapping on Huanlong Road, Patrol Was Shot</h3>
<p>Cases of kidnapping and assassination in this city have emerged one after another. Yesterday, the consular corps was holding a meeting to curb political violence. Unexpectedly, at 8:20 yesterday morning, a case of a gangster shooting and killing Mr. Charles Metzler, chairman of the White Russian community in Shanghai and a famous White Russian leader in the Far East, occurred at 208 Fuyang Road. He was injured and died in the car. At around 8:50 AM on the same morning, a kidnapping case occurred at the corner of Avenyi Road and Wenzhou Road. The kidnapped person was Shen Jinzhou, manager of Yitaixing Coal Ball Shop. In addition, at around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, a resident on Huanlong Road was about to board a car to go out to do errands. He was threatened by gangsters waiting there. Fortunately, he escaped by being alert, but the guard at the post was shot and injured. It is found that the above three cases almost occurred at the same time. The details of each case are described as follows:</p>
<h3>Bloodshed on Nanyang Road: White Russian Leader Assassinated</h3>
<p>Charles Metzler, Chairman of the White Russian Emigrant Committee in Shanghai and a prominent White Russian leader in the Far East, was shot dead yesterday morning at 8:20 AM. He was leaving his private residence at 208 Nanyang Road, Apartment 17 on the second floor of the Avenue Apartments. As he stepped outside and entered his private car (license plate number 4811), driven by Zhou Zhengui (from Shaoxing), his chauffeur of 16 years, who was just about to start the engine:</p>
<p>Entering the Car, He Was Immediately Attacked</p>
<p>Suddenly, a Xiang Sheng taxi (license plate number 17972) pulled up in front. A thug dressed in white silk clothing jumped out of the taxi, pulled out a pistol, and fired two shots directly at Metzler in the car. The chauffeur, Zhou Zhengui, panicked and fled the scene. Returning shortly thereafter, he saw the assailant jump back into the taxi, which was about to drive away. Zhou immediately followed in his car, chasing it to the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road. Suddenly, several more thugs appeared on the side of the road, threatening Zhou Zhengui with pistols and forcing him to drive back to the original location.</p>
<p>A Likeness of Mr. Metzler</p>
<p>Two Bullets to the Chest, Instant Death</p>
<p>The assailant fired two more shots at Metzler, then they all fled. As a result, Metzler took two bullets to the left chest, bleeding profusely and barely breathing. A foreign national who witnessed the horrific event at the scene immediately urged the chauffeur to drive his master to Hong En Hospital on Avenue Haig for treatment. However, Metzler died en route. His body has been moved to the International Funeral Parlor. According to a foreign national who lived in the same apartment building as Metzler, there appeared to be four thugs in the Xiang Sheng taxi, but only one directly committed the act.</p>
<p>The Local Russian Community Deeply Shocked and Angered</p>
<p>After the assassination, the entire Russian community in Shanghai was deeply shocked and angered, as Metzler had contributed significantly to the welfare of the Russian community during his lifetime. Before his death, Metzler had maintained close contact with Japanese consular officials and was known to be pro-Japanese. Two weeks prior, he had visited Japanese Consul-General Miura Yoshiaki to discuss the status of the Russian community in Shanghai. The Consul-General reportedly promised to support Metzler's re-election as Chairman of the Russian Emigrant Committee. One month ago, the puppet mayor, Chuan Xiaoan, had also given Metzler the same assurance. It is believed that after this tragic incident, the Russian community in Shanghai will show even greater indifference towards the new Russian organizations sponsored by the Japanese.</p>
<p>Telegram Urges Metzler's Wife to Return to Shanghai for Funeral</p>
<p>Reporters visited Metzler's private residence, which was richly furnished. Metzler's sister-in-law and several servants remained in the house. They revealed that Metzler's wife had gone to Japan four days earlier to escape the summer heat and recuperate from an illness. She has been notified by telegram and urged to return to Shanghai by plane to arrange her husband's funeral. Metzler was 52 years old and had lived in Shanghai for nearly 25 years. He majored in law at the University of Saint Petersburg and later studied at the Imperial Russian Oriental Languages Institute. In 1908, he was appointed Deputy Consul of the Imperial Russian Consulate in Mongolia. In 1912, he was promoted to Secretary of the Imperial Russian Embassy in Beijing, and soon after, he was assigned to Shanghai as a Consul. After the closure of the Imperial Russian Consulate in Shanghai in 1923, Metzler worked at the Danish Insurance Company for eight years. He then became a senior executive at the American Manufacturers Foreign Credit Insurance Association.</p>
<h3>Manager of Yi Tai Xing Coal Company, Shen Jinzhou, Kidnapped</h3>
<p>A kidnapping occurred yesterday morning around 8:50 AM at the corner of Rue A.M. Dollfus and Wenzhou Road. The victim was Shen Jinzhou, a native of Yuyao and the manager of the major coal company Yi Tai Xing Coal Company in Shanghai. Four bandits jumped into Shen's private car, number 5186, and sped westwards. Around 11:00 AM, the company's car was found at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue Chu Pao San. Details of the incident are as follows:</p>
<p>Traveling by Car</p>
<p>Shen Jinzhou, 53, from Yuyao, Zhejiang Province, resides alone at No. 3, Lane 239, Pinghe Lane, Avenue A.M. Dollfus. Shen is a shareholder and manager of Yi Tai Xing Coal Company at 184 Xinzha Road and also serves as an executive director of the Zhonghua Coal Ball Company. He owns a Ford car, number 5186, for transportation and employs Gu Amao, a 34-year-old chauffeur from Nantong, who has been working for him for more than a year.</p>
<p>Suddenly Kidnapped</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 8:50 AM, Shen, as usual, got into his car to go to the Yi Tai Xing Coal Company at 184 Xinzha Road and then to inspect the factory at 352 McTaggart Road. However, as the car turned east from Pinghe Lane onto the corner of Avenue A.M. Dollfus and Wenzhou Road, four bandits, who were lying in wait, blocked the car. Two of them, one wearing a white Zhongshan suit and the other a paletot, each pulled out a pistol and stopped the car from moving forward, threatening and intimidating the occupants. They opened the car door, and the bandits swarmed in. Two bandits entered the passenger compartment, holding the victim hostage with guns in hand, preventing him from moving. The other two bandits stepped into the front, guarding the chauffeur Gu Amao.</p>
<p>Car Found</p>
<p>They ordered him to drive south, heading west on Jing'an Temple Road until the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Chengdu Road, where they forced Amao out of the car. One of the bandits then drove the car further west, disappearing without a trace. Afterwards, Amao returned to his residence to report the kidnapping to the family and reported the incident to the Xinzha police station for rescue and investigation. Upon receiving the report, the police dispatched detectives to investigate the scene and brought the chauffeur Gu Amao to the police station to interrogate him about the kidnapping. They also searched for the kidnappers to bring them to justice. Around 1:00 PM in the afternoon, Shen's car was found at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue Chu Pao San and was taken back to the police station, ordering the Shen family to take the car. When Shen was kidnapped yesterday morning, he was wearing a white silk long gown and silk trousers, a straw hat, and cloth-soled satin shoes.</p>
<h3>Attempted Kidnapping on Route Cardinal Mercier</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, a resident of a house on Route Cardinal Mercier had just left his doorway and was about to step into his private car when four thugs suddenly threatened him, intending to kidnap him. Upon seeing this, the servants rushed forward to stop them. One of the thugs tried to pull out a gun and fire, but the gun jammed and failed to discharge. The resident, upon seeing this, became overly frightened and fainted to the ground. At that time, other pedestrians passed by and ran to inform Hua Bu No. 1057, stationed at the intersection of Route Cardinal Mercier and Route Hua Long. The policeman hesitated and retorted to the pedestrian, "How do you know they have guns?" Before he finished speaking, the thugs heard the commotion and fired at the policeman with a pistol, hitting him in the back. The thugs then fled in a panic, leaving behind a pistol. The injured policeman was immediately taken to the French police hospital. His condition is stable. The French police are continuing to investigate the case. Whether the incident is politically motivated remains to be determined.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador Cables Safe Arrival in Weihaiwei</h3>
<p>Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador, quietly left Shanghai on the Tai Koo Shipping Company's Hunan on the 30th of last month. A cable received yesterday announced his safe arrival in Weihaiwei, where he met with the Ambassador's wife. Ambassador Kerr's trip is a one-week vacation. His stay there is purely a private trip and does not involve any official business.</p>
<h3>Consular Body Held Meeting Yesterday, Issued Important Resolutions, Sent Letter to Shanghai Municipal Council with Several Suggestions, Urging Close Cooperation Among Foreign Defense Forces</h3>
<p>Due to the rampant terrorist activities in the International Settlement, Mr. Stirling Fessenden, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, made an earnest appeal to the Consular Body on the 22nd of last month, requesting cooperation to curb these activities. Subsequently, Mr. Herbert Phillips, the Doyen of the Consular Body, convened a meeting of the Consular Body to discuss the matter. However, due to the Japanese Consul-General Miura's shifting of the blame to the Chinese government, the meeting did not reach a definitive decision. It was decided to reconvene the Consular Body meeting yesterday to continue the discussion.</p>
<p>Strict Security</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, the meeting was held in the Shanghai Municipal Council's conference room. Due to the importance of the meeting, security was tight, and reporters were denied access. Only consuls from various countries were allowed to attend. The meeting was held in secret for two and a half hours, and the contents remained confidential.</p>
<p>Resolutions Issued</p>
<p>However, after the discussion, the following resolutions were issued: "The Shanghai Consular Body considers all acts of terrorism to be contrary to the principles of humanity and civilization. In view of the tragic impact of such acts in Shanghai, this body strongly condemns terrorism in any form or by anyone. Given the actual situation in Shanghai, the body urges the Shanghai Municipal Council to fully consider the situation here and to make every effort to suppress and prevent all acts of terrorism in order to maintain peace and order."</p>
<p>Preparing a Reply</p>
<p>According to the Doyen of the Consular Body, Mr. Herbert Phillips, the Consular Body has already sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council with several suggestions, urging the Shanghai Municipal Police and the foreign defense forces stationed in Shanghai to cooperate. However, before the meeting, when reporters interviewed Japanese Consul-General Miura, Miura maintained his view that the terrorist incidents in the International Settlement were entirely caused by so-called Chongqing elements. Miura used this excuse to pressure the Consular Body meeting.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Postmaster Jappelyn Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Morning, Discussed with Japanese Officials Regarding Mail Inspection in the French Concession</h3>
<p>Mr. Jappelyn, the French postmaster of the Shanghai Postal Administration, left Shanghai on the 16th of last month, traveling via Hong Kong to Yunnan. Because Mr. Guo Xinsong, the Director-General of the Postal Administration, was in Chongqing on official business, Jappelyn then traveled from Yunnan to Chongqing to report on the situation of the four postal districts of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi. He also provided detailed information on the general postal affairs in Shanghai. Due to the urgent need to handle official duties in Shanghai, he traveled via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, arriving in Hong Kong and taking the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Yuesheng to Shanghai. Mr. Jappelyn arrived in Shanghai at 7:13 AM yesterday morning and returned to his residence to rest. After 2:00 PM, he returned to the Postal Administration for an informal meeting with Mr. Kanaji Kin-ichiro to discuss concrete measures for inspecting mail in the French Concession.</p>
<p>Mail Inspection Situation</p>
<p>Reporters from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the Post Office on Route Masnan that the branch office had already prepared the record book for recording suspicious mail to be detained by Japanese inspectors. It was reported that formal inspection had indeed begun, but no mail had been detained yet. All preparatory procedures had been completed. Mr. Huang Kuanhua, head of the administration section of the branch, also reported this. The branch office also frankly admitted that gradual inspection would likely begin in the future. Yesterday, the inspectors did not go to the Post Office on Route Masnan due to a temporary notice from Director Kanaji, reportedly due to the arrival of Postmaster Jappelyn in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Iron Gates of Nanshi Fully Opened, Rumors Swirl Again, Claiming Shanghai West End Gambling Dens and Brothels Moving to Nanshi Simultaneously</h3>
<p>Yesterday, rumors spread that the iron gates adjacent to Nanshi, which have been closed for a long time, would be fully opened on the 6th of this month. There were also rumors that, due to the above reasons, gambling dens and brothels on the Shanghai West End and in Caojiadu would simultaneously move to Nanshi to operate. They allegedly have obtained joint permission from the puppet detective team, the "self-defense force," the "police bureau," and the Japanese military police and special forces. This is because the International Settlement authorities have tightened security in the West End, causing business in the gambling dens to decline, so they have long sought other locations. However, there have been many obstacles in Nanshi, so it has not yet been realized. Reporters from the Dagang News Agency inquired about this matter from various parties yesterday but could not confirm it. However, the houses in Yanhai Lane and other places have been completely rented out, reportedly for use as gambling dens and brothels. This, combined with the proliferation of open-air gambling dens in the alleys of Nanshi, makes the rumor of gambling dens moving to Nanshi difficult to dismiss.</p>
<h3>Ni Lanshen Kidnapped Last Night</h3>
<p>Ni Lanshen, an editor at the Xinwen Daily, was kidnapped last night at 11 PM. As he entered Shenyu Lane on Route Hua Cheng in the French Concession, where he lived, two men in Western suits suddenly rushed out from behind, grabbed Mr. Ni on both sides, and dragged him out of the lane, forcing him into a black-plated car with license plate number 3459, which was parked at the entrance of the lane. The car sped away. At the time, Mrs. Ni was preparing medicine because Mr. Ni had been feeling slightly unwell. It was only when onlookers in the lane reported what they had witnessed that she realized what had happened. She immediately reported the incident to the police station and requested an investigation.</p>
<h3>Yixing Association Raising Funds for Drought Relief</h3>
<p>Yixing is located at the junction of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. Mountains account for most of its area. It is prone to disasters when it encounters drought. Since the beginning of summer this year, there has been little rain, and the fields in various villages cannot be planted with rice. The drought is severe, and coupled with the ongoing war, the disaster victims are displaced, and starvation is rampant. The Yixing Association in Shanghai, recognizing the many difficulties in its hometown, convened the 7th Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees the day before yesterday to discuss drought relief matters. In addition to requesting emergency relief from charitable organizations, it plans to allocate a large sum of money to relieve the disaster victims in its county.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Revised Commercial Exchange Rate, British Exchange at Four and a Half Pence, Supported by Both Chinese and Foreign Parties</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance strengthened foreign exchange management, it allowed exporters of foreign exchange settlement goods to receive foreign exchange differences and supplied as much foreign exchange as possible for the import of essential goods. Now, in order to encourage the export of domestic goods and restrict the import of non-essential goods, it ordered that the "commercial exchange rate" of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications be adjusted from the old rate of seven pence to four and a half pence. In addition to notifying the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Trade Commission, it also telegraphed the silver and money industry associations to comply. The legal exchange rate of the fiat currency against the British exchange rate remains unchanged at one shilling and two and a half pence. Outsiders, unaware of this, thought that the fiat currency had depreciated, which is a misunderstanding of the central government's intention to support exporters and restrict the import of non-essential goods.</p>
<p>Beneficial to Both Importers and Exporters</p>
<p>The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications' commercial exchange rate has been adjusted to four and a half pence per British exchange rate since August 1st. Reporters from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that (1) for the export of domestic goods, for tung oil, bristles, tea, and minerals that are purchased, transported, and sold under the overall planning of the government, as well as for egg products, feathers, casings, leather, seeds, tobacco, wood, ramie, furs, kudzu, medicinal materials, oil wax, and cotton products that are settled in foreign exchange, exporters can receive the difference between the legal price and the price listed by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications upon presentation of settlement documents after the actual settlement of the foreign exchange amount. The intention is to allow exporters to receive this foreign exchange difference to subsidize transportation losses, thereby encouraging their exports, and to obtain benefits equivalent to the black market fiat exchange rate. In this way, foreign exchange evasion can be reduced, and the effect of collecting Chinese and foreign exchange can be achieved.</p>
<p>Applying for Fiat Exchange Requires Payment of Balancing Fee</p>
<p>(2) For the import of foreign goods, if the imported goods of the importer are not subject to import bans and are necessary for the country, they may apply to the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee for the purchase of foreign exchange. However, the applicant must pay a balancing fee based on the difference between the legal price and the price listed by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. The significance is as follows: Since the import of non-essential and luxury goods has already been prohibited, the import of essential goods should be supplied as much as possible to reduce the burden on the people caused by the shrinking foreign exchange market and the increase in prices. In the past, all imported goods, whether essential, non-essential, or luxury goods, were given foreign exchange based on the ability to show standard verification, which led to competition for foreign exchange in the black market, causing the black market exchange rate to become increasingly scarce. Now that essential goods are supplied with foreign exchange, and non-essential and luxury goods are prohibited from import, it is hoped that the black market exchange rate will be more stable.</p>
<p>Legal Exchange Rate Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>Regarding the legal foreign exchange rate, it has remained unchanged since the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee made every effort to stabilize it. The Central Bank's legal foreign exchange listing price is one shilling and two and a half pence for British exchange and thirty yuan for US exchange. The expenses for banks to handle foreign exchange settlement have now been changed to be borne by the government. The original regulations that merchants should pay a handling fee within the limit of 3% of the difference between the legal foreign exchange price and the bank's listed price when applying for the legal foreign exchange price from the bank have been waived. In the past, when merchants settled foreign exchange with banks, they settled at 90% of the actual sales amount filled in the actual sales price certificate, but now it has been changed to 80%. For goods transferred from the southwestern provinces that require a lot of foreign currency expenses through foreign ports, it can be reduced to 70% to allow exporters to export large quantities of goods, thereby increasing foreign exchange income and balancing international payments.</p>
<p>Making It Almost the Same as the Black Market</p>
<p>Reporters from the Xin Sheng News Agency further learned from foreign banks yesterday that Shanghai's black market foreign exchange rates were previously caused by the Chinese government's restriction on the supply of legal foreign exchange, so that those who could not apply for legal foreign exchange had to purchase foreign exchange in the black market. At the same time, speculators deliberately manipulated the market, causing the black market exchange rate to fluctuate sharply, and legitimate merchants suffered greatly. The "commercial exchange rate" of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications listed at seven pence for British exchange and thirteen yuan and six hundred and twenty-five yuan for US exchange. The Central Bank's legal exchange rate listed at one shilling and two pence and a half for British exchange and thirty yuan for US exchange, but the difference from the Shanghai black market exchange rate was still large, so it was actually necessary to lower the "commercial exchange rate" so that the black market could be stable for a long time. Now that the Chinese government has suppressed the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications' listing to be almost the same as the black market, the black market will not have any drastic changes in the future.</p>
<p>Financial Markets Unanimously Support It</p>
<p>Foreign businessmen have expressed support for the government's measures. The source of foreign exchange for the fiat currency will increase as exporters will receive more income after the exchange rate is revised. They will voluntarily sell their foreign exchange bills to the government, and the entire source of foreign exchange will naturally become more abundant. The news of this revised exchange rate was already known to well-informed parties in Shanghai. However, because it was understood that this change was purely a technical effect of adjusting the foreign exchange market, the entire foreign exchange market was not affected in any way. After the news was announced yesterday, the market briefly reacted. The US exchange rate briefly shrank to five yuan and eight hundred and twelve yuan, and gold rose to five thousand five hundred yuan. However, the overall situation was very stable. As for the stock market, it went through a very calm period.</p>
<h3>Dutch Royal Ships Suspended, Hong Kong and Burma Flying Started, Provisionally Scheduled to Fly Once Every Saturday, Haiphong Freight Transport Stalled</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Second World War in Europe, the Mediterranean has been closed, which has not only caused major obstacles to European shipping but has also changed the routes and kept the schedules secret for the ships traveling on the Europe-Asia route. Therefore, Chinese newspapers in this city have rarely disclosed the schedules of ships with the nationality of the belligerent countries. As for French and Italian commercial ships, they have been suspended. The Italian ship Conte Verde is still anchored at buoys 16 and 17 in the Huangpu River, and there is no schedule to resume sailing. The Java route from Shanghai to Batavia, Macassar, Samarang, and Surabaya in the Dutch East Indies is exclusively operated by the Java Mail Ship Company in this city, with more than ten ships with the "Zhi" character. The Netherlands has also been thrown into the vortex of the European war, and the schedules of the company's ships are also kept secret.</p>
<p>Dutch Royal Ships</p>
<p>Suddenly Announced Suspension</p>
<p>In addition, the Dutch Royal Company, which operates in East Africa, has three ships, such as the Boisgevain, the Ruys, and the Tegclberg, all of which are equal in size, about 15,000 tons. Originally, they sailed to various ports in Hong Kong, the South Seas Islands, and East Africa. Later, from 1938, they began to come to Shanghai and Taiwan, managed by the Java Mail Ship Company. Since these three ships have been operating in Shanghai, the company has recently heard that due to the current situation, it will temporarily suspend the three ships. Since then, there will be no direct shipping lines from this city to East Africa.</p>
<p>Haiphong Freight Transport</p>
<p>Completely Stalled</p>
<p>As for the port of Haiphong in Vietnam, since the fall of Guangzhou in South China, the port has suddenly become a passage connecting the interior, and commerce has gradually prospered. Unexpectedly, it has recently been oppressed by the Japanese, and transportation has been invisibly stalled. Although the British companies Taikoo and Jardine Matheson in this city continue to maintain the Shanghai-Fangcheng line, the outgoing goods have disappeared, and only foreign rice is arriving.</p>
<p>Hong Kong and Burma Aviation</p>
<p>Trial Flight Good</p>
<p>It is also heard that the Hong Kong-Hanoi air route operated by the French airline Air France has been flying once a week from Hong Kong to Hanoi every Thursday. Recently, due to certain reasons, it has suddenly been suspended. It is difficult to predict when it will resume. In addition, the Hong Kong-Rangoon (Burma) air route trial-operated by the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) was trial-flown on the 20th of last month with excellent results. It is heard that there will be a stopover in Kunming or Chongqing. The location must be temporarily determined. The flight schedule is tentatively set for once every Saturday. The fare is 654 rupees per person in Burmese currency. This makes it much more convenient between Hong Kong and Burma.</p>

<h3>Japanese Warship Sailed to Zhenhai Yesterday; Three Gunboats Fully Loaded with Munitions and Provisions; Japanese Warships Indiscriminately Opened Fire on Zhenhai Waters</h3>
<p>Three Japanese gunboats, fully loaded with munitions and provisions from the Japanese military supply depot in Wusong, set sail from Wusong around 3 p.m. yesterday, heading to Zhenhai for combat. Each ship also carried marines and rubber dinghies, suggesting an intention to land.</p>
<p>Zhenhai War Report</p>
<p>The Ningbo sojourner groups in Shanghai continued to receive telegrams from Ningbo yesterday, stating that around 5 a.m. on the 31st, two Japanese warships of various sizes were spotted patrolling the waters off Yushan, outside Zhenhai. Ten minutes later, one of the Japanese warships suddenly opened fire on our fortress, firing over thirty shots before ceasing. An hour later, the two Japanese warships sailed north. At 8:40 a.m., clear cannon fire was heard in Ningbo, seemingly coming from Zhenhai. The source of the fire has not yet been officially announced. Furthermore, at 8:31 a.m. on the same day, heavy engine sounds were heard northeast of Longshan for about twenty minutes before gradually subsiding. Two Japanese warships in the Qijiao waters of Xiangshan Port sailed towards Tingshuimen around 6 a.m. yesterday. Additionally, one Japanese warship each was anchored off Huangniu Reef and Wushi Mountain. They sailed to the Qijiao waters yesterday and suddenly fired over thirty shots at the coast of Dsong area in eastern Yindong. The shells landed in the mud, causing no damage. The two Japanese warships previously anchored off Zhenhai sailed towards the Qili Ji waters around 9 a.m. on the 1st without any unusual movements. Yesterday, one Japanese warship anchored upstream in the Qiancang waters suddenly opened fire indiscriminately at the coast of Xiangshan Port, firing four or five shots. All the shells landed in the mud, causing absolutely no damage.</p>
<p>Japanese Plane Crashed</p>
<p>Yesterday, a visitor from Dinghai informed a reporter from the Daguan News Agency that at 12 p.m. on the 27th of last month, a Japanese seaplane bomber, carrying heavy bombs, took off from the waters off Tougang in Dinghai, intending to bomb Zhenhai in support of the war effort. However, due to the pilot's poor skills, it accidentally struck the mast of a sailboat in the waters off Tougang facing Guishan Mountain during takeoff and crashed. The fuselage was severely damaged, and all four crew members were seriously injured and sent to the "Imperial Army Hospital" in the city's West Gate for treatment.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo Transportation</p>
<p>Since the interruption of shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo, travel for passengers has been difficult. Recently, a few passengers from Ningbo arrived in Shanghai by detour. Their routes were as follows: From Ningbo, cross the sea to Lichuang, Yuwang, to Chaiqiao in Zhenhai, cross the sea to Ligang, and take the Ban Hai Yi steamer to Shanghai. From Ningbo to Andong in Yuyao, cross the sea to Zhapu, and then travel to Shanghai. However, these routes are inconvenient and extremely dangerous, so they should not be taken lightly.</p>

<h3>New Gambling Den Opens Next to German School on Avenue Haig; Largest Scale Among Gambling Dens; Gambling Begins Without a License</h3>
<p>The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reported that a gambling den opened last night (the 1st) near the German school on Avenue Haig. Its grandeur and luxurious decoration are unmatched among Shanghai's gambling dens. According to a reporter from someone who visited the gambling den last night, the opening was extremely crowded, with no fewer than two or three thousand people. All kinds of gambling games, such as roulette, were available. It is said that the new gambling den is funded and operated by the owners of various gambling dens forced to close in the Badlands. It is located on Avenue Haig in the Public Concession, with the rear of the building next to the German school. It is reported that it began operating last night without obtaining a license. The various gambling dens in the Badlands are quite worried about the competition from this new gambling den, so the new gambling den may not be able to operate smoothly. According to another source, the gambling den is named "Six Nations Hotel," and the manager is surnamed Zhu.</p>
<h3>Handgun Robbery</h3>
<p>At 6:30 a.m. yesterday morning, a case of bandits robbing a public service handgun from a Sikh watchman occurred at the entrance of the Foch Fang alley on Avenue Foch. According to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, the Sikh watchman was named Chu Zhizhong, 45 years old, from Yancheng. Yesterday morning, while Chu was on duty, a small car suddenly drove from the east on Avenue Foch. Upon reaching the entrance, it stopped abruptly. Three passengers got out of the car and asked Chu for directions. Taking advantage of Chu's unpreparedness, they restrained him. One of the bandits, wearing a Western suit, pulled out a Mauser pistol and warned Chu not to make a sound. Another bandit, wearing Chinese clothing, robbed Chu's official handgun, No. 36688, and six bullets. They then sped away in the original car towards the west. Afterwards, the watchman reported to the police station for investigation.</p>
<h3>Two Car Robberies in Shanghai West Badlands; Cars Later Returned to Original Locations</h3>
<p>Within two hours yesterday morning, two car robbery cases occurred in the Shanghai West Badlands. One involved a dispatch car from Yunfei Company (license No. 12339, driver Gui Linsheng, local).

<h3>Younger Brother Urged Older Brother to Jump into the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Bai Jinjiang, 40 years old, from Ningbo, lived at a certain address on Kaifeng Road. He used to work as a comprador for the Sanbei Shipping Company and as a chief accountant for the Zhenbei Shipping Company. He became unemployed after the August 13th Incident and has been living idly for several years. He has been experiencing extreme financial difficulties. Recently, with the high cost of living, it has been difficult to support a family of several people. Yesterday morning, Bai went to the Bank of China on the Bund in the French Concession to borrow ten dollars from his younger brother, Bai Jiugao (currently the deputy director of the savings department of the bank). His request was rejected. In the end, he only wanted to borrow one dollar to take a taxi home. Bai Jiugao not only refused but also said to his older brother, "This place is very close to the Huangpu River. You might as well go jump in." Bai Jinjiang was extremely heartbroken upon hearing this. He turned around and went outside, to Pier No. 1 on the Bund, and jumped into the river to commit suicide. Fortunately, a Chinese police officer saw him and managed to pull him out. Because he had swallowed too much water, he was disoriented. An ambulance was called and he was sent to Tongren Hospital. After emergency treatment by the doctor, his life was no longer in danger.</p>
<h3>New Owner of Merchandise Building Forcing Tenants to Vacate; Seventy-Seven Tenants Hope for Protection</h3>
<p>The Merchandise Building at No. 110 Avenue Edward VII, also known as the Merchandise Securities Exchange at No. 1 Sichuan Road, was used as a wounded soldier's hospital at the beginning of the August 13th Incident. Later, it became a refugee shelter. The owner, Dehe &amp; Co., later sent staff because some of the refugees had also established transportation companies or factory offices in the building, etc.</p>
<p>Collecting Rent</p>
<p>Those living there paid rent and established an indefinite lease relationship with the owner. At the end of April this year, Dehe &amp; Co. sold the property to Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., a British company. The tenants negotiated their lease rights with Dehe &amp; Co., and the company replied that they should negotiate with the new owner. Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. then notified all tenants that they must</p>
<p>Vacate by the End of July</p>
<p>Currently, there are a total of seventy-seven families living there, with more than a thousand men, women, old and young. At a time when the cost of living is high and it is difficult to find housing, they have nowhere to move. They have repeatedly negotiated with the new owner to continue renting and living there, but to no avail. Around 9 a.m. yesterday morning, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. sent staff accompanied by several Chinese police officers to the location to force the tenants to move out by cutting off the water supply. The tenants protested</p>
<p>Nearly Resulting in a Conflict</p>
<p>The owner's reason for forcing the tenants to move out was that a portion of the building was burned down in a fire in February of this year, and the entire building needs to be renovated. However, the tenants unanimously believe that there is no need for renovation. During the dispute between the two sides, the police station sent a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to the scene to mediate. As a result, the water supply was temporarily not cut off, and the burned part was demolished first. The remaining issues will be discussed further by both parties. The tenants' association has appointed lawyer Ge Cheng to advocate for legal protection on their behalf. There may be a satisfactory resolution to this landlord-tenant dispute in the future.</p>
<h3>Detailed Account of the Yu Yuan Road Robbery; Five Bandits Led by a Female Bandit</h3>
<p>The *North-China Daily News* reported that the Jing'an Temple police station received a robbery alarm on Yu Yuan Road yesterday afternoon (the 1st) and immediately sent police officers to the scene. Unexpectedly, an incident occurred, and three Chinese police officers from the Public Concession were detained by the Japanese military police for three hours. They were released around 5 p.m. The details are as follows: At 12:20 p.m. yesterday,</p>
<p>Five Bandits</p>
<p>Two of whom were armed, broke into No. 41, Lane 608, Yu Yuan Road to commit robbery. Upon receiving the report, the Jing'an Temple police station immediately dispatched a team of patrol officers led by Chief Inspector Curtis, who sped to the scene. They arrived in just two minutes, surrounded the robbed house, and blocked the streets in front and behind. Then, they drew their guns and approached. They saw one of the robbers acting as a lookout at the back door and ordered him to stop. However, the robber was alert and scattered</p>
<p>Climbing on the Roof</p>
<p>And fled before the patrol officers entered the house. One of the robbers jumped over the back wall and escaped. To avoid misidentifying others, the patrol officers did not open fire but carefully observed. When the robbers re-entered various houses in the lane, they began searching house by house. The residents were obviously frightened and did not provide assistance. However, the patrol officers continued their search and finally found a person at No. 47 who claimed to be a cook. This aroused the suspicion of patrol officer Tagliaferro. Tagliaferro withdrew and</p>
<p>Informed the Patrol Chief</p>
<p>Wright, and after asking Wright to strengthen precautions, he re-entered No. 47. Then, one of the residents pointed to the washroom and whispered to Tagliaferro, "Robber." Tagliaferro entered the room and arrested the bandit posing as a cook. Just as he was about to interrogate him, around 1 p.m., some "municipal police" arrived at the scene. After learning the situation, they questioned him together with the Public Concession patrol officers. Tagliaferro handed over the arrested person to the "municipal police" and continued</p>
<p>To Carry Out the Search</p>
<p>At 1:30 p.m., suddenly a company of Japanese military police, led by Captain Shida, marched into the street in formation. Shida immediately asked Wright, "What authority do Public Concession patrol officers have to operate in the outer-road area?" Wright replied that the Jing'an Temple police station had dispatched patrol officers after receiving a report from a foreigner. However, the Japanese continued to object. Wright then handed over one of the arrested bandits and a large number of stolen goods to the Japanese military police. However, Shida's attitude</p>
<p>Remained Stubborn</p>
<p>And ordered the Japanese military police to arrest three Chinese patrol officers from the Jing'an Temple police station before allowing the remaining patrol officers to withdraw. Soon after, the Japanese military police and the "municipal police" conducted a perfunctory investigation and left the scene together. Although one of the bandits was arrested, the remaining four bandits were likely still hiding in the houses along the street. When the Public Concession patrol officers were at the scene, Chinese men were not allowed to enter or leave the houses in the lane. Among the stolen items recovered at the time, there was at least one discarded piece of clothing. The street is usually sparsely populated, and the robbery was</p>
<p>Carefully Planned</p>
<p>The Jing'an Temple police station received a report from a foreign employee of the *North-China Daily News* and quickly dispatched officers to surround and arrest them, which stopped the robbery. When the robbery occurred, it was led by a woman. The woman was familiar with the habits of the residents of No. 41 and the names of the maids. She led the bandits to call the maid to open the door, preventing her from making a sound, and then entered the house, driving the residents into a room. Then, they used a gun to force the homeowner's son to lead them to the room where a large amount of cash was stored. Just as the lookout saw the patrol officers arriving, he shouted a warning, and the bandits scattered and fled.</p>
<h3>Elderly Man in His Sixties in Love with a Dancer; Concubine Sues for Separate Residence and Support; Reconciliation Reached at Second Hearing Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Zhang Qinshun, a wealthy merchant from Shaoxing, 63 years old, owns a large property on Nanjing Road. His wife has passed away, and he has a concubine, Zhang Huang, 38 years old, with whom he has five children, the oldest 17 and the youngest 9. After the war, he brought his family to Shanghai and resided at No. 292 Yuelai Apartment on Jing'an Temple Road. Recently, his concubine hired a lawyer, claiming that Zhang frequented dance halls,</p>
<p>Infatuated with a Dancer and filed a lawsuit in the Shanghai First Special District Local Court for separate residence and payment of 15,840 yuan in alimony. Judge Tao had already held a hearing on the 22nd of last month, ordering a rescheduling for continued hearing on the 2nd of this month and ordering the defendant to bring the children for questioning. The case was heard again yesterday morning in the First Tribunal by Judge Tao. The plaintiff arrived with her representative, lawyer Wu, and the defendant also arrived with</p>
<p>Two Eldest Sons</p>
<p>Accompanied by his representatives, lawyers Zhu Chengxun and Xu Fengyi. The plaintiff first stated that the defendant frequented dance halls and neglected his family, and even abused her, requesting the payment of over 15,000 yuan in alimony. When questioned, the defendant claimed that he had not abused the plaintiff and that frequenting dance halls was only occasional. Since the plaintiff left without saying goodbye, if she wanted to leave, he would not force her to stay, but refused to pay alimony. After repeated persuasion by the judge and the lawyers on both sides, by 12 p.m.,</p>
<p>Reconciliation Was Reached</p>
<p>The plaintiff agreed to return home to live together. The defendant would allocate over 20 yuan of the rental income from a portion of the land in Shaoxing and give the plaintiff a fixed amount of 25 yuan in national currency per month. Furthermore, the defendant would return 796 yuan in national currency, the rental income he had received in the past two years, to the plaintiff. Both parties signed the reconciliation record before leaving the court.</p>
<h3>Murder in Shanghai West; Cao Xingen Died from Gunshot Wounds</h3>
<p>Cao Xingen, 27 years old, who lived in Chenjiadu, north of Zhoujiaqiao, Shanghai West, was with his friend Pan around 7 p.m. the night before last. While Cao and Pan were near Beixinjing, several people wearing miscellaneous clothing suddenly kidnapped Cao to a nearby cemetery. They pulled out a Mauser pistol and shot Cao several times, all hitting vital points. His friend Pan was also kidnapped by them to another location and then released. It is rumored that Cao's murder was due to a military equipment issue. Whether it had political overtones is not confirmed as no other clues could be found.</p>
<h3>Social Miscellany</h3>
<p>Zheng Qinnan, 25 years old, from Suzhou, was a shipping clerk at Shen Da &amp; Co. at No. 47 Yanghang Street. Because he embezzled three checks from the company, totaling 11,964 yuan, he immediately cashed out 10,000 yuan from the Guohua Bank and fled to No. 18 Yulin Road. When the company manager, Shen Yanying, discovered the embezzlement and reported it to the French police station, detective Shao Guanrong was dispatched to arrest Zheng and confiscate 7,700 yuan in cash. He was then sent to the First Criminal Division of the First Special District Court and prosecuted for embezzlement. Judge Li held a hearing yesterday morning and scheduled a verdict for the 6th, ordering the confiscated 7,700 yuan to be returned to the original owner and the defendant to be detained.</p>
<p>Feng Baishun, Chinese Chief Inspector of the Putuo Road Police Station, along with detectives Li Wenzhao and Jia Di, recently learned that someone was running a gambling den in a bungalow in Caoxiebang, Putuo Road, profiting from skimming. Yesterday, they and Western detectives arrested the owner, Wu Wanzhang, and seventeen male and female gamblers, along with dominoes and dice cups. They were all taken to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special District Court, where police lawyer Peng Qiqi filed a lawsuit in accordance with the law. Judge Meng sentenced Wu to four months of imprisonment, fined the other gamblers fifteen yuan each, and confiscated the gambling equipment.</p>
<p>Zhu Hongjin, a handyman from Yixing who worked for the Shenhe Truck Company at No. 165 Alal Street, argued with his companion, Shao Arong, in front of the truck company on the evening of the 7th of last month over a minor matter. Shao Arong beat Mao Hongsheng, a flower seller, to death with his fists. They were arrested and sent to the First Special District Court for prosecution. Judge Jiang Shuzi concluded the hearing, and yesterday morning, the case was brought to the court for sentencing. Zhu Hongjin and Shao Arong were sentenced to four years of imprisonment each for jointly causing death by injury. The accompanying civil lawsuit was transferred to the Civil Division of the court for hearing.</p>
<p>The robber, Zhu Zhigen, from Hangzhou, along with Chen Ruirong, who is still at large, carried a lotus seed-style real and fake handgun each and four bullets. On the morning of one day, at 10 a.m., they invaded the home of Chen Chengbing at No. 51, Lane 117, Chengdu Road to commit robbery. They were apprehended by the neighbor, Xu Adi, and handed over to the Chengdu Road Police Station along with the firearms and ammunition.

<p>At 7:10 a.m. yesterday morning, Zhang Laichang (23 years old), a Chongming native working for the Oriental Bakery Company at No. 71 Avenue Dubail, was dispatching goods on a three-wheeled delivery tricycle. When Zhang was driving past No. 1540 Avenue Joffre, a private car with license No. 10442 driven by En Caihuaiduan (transliteration), a German merchant from No. 261 Jiaochuan Road, was speeding from west to east. Zhang was unable to avoid it and was knocked down and crushed in the head. The police chief arrived and sent Zhang to Guangci Hospital. He died at noon. The police station moved the body to the Tongren Fu Yuan Branch for autopsy.</p>

<p>Learning Western Languages</p>
<p>The Zuo Zhuan says, "Enjoy local customs and do not forget the old." Although Chu was considered a Yi-Di (barbarian tribe) during the Spring and Autumn period, it was actually within the Huaxia (Chinese) civilization. Yet, even in interactions, not forgetting the local accent was praised as gentlemanly. Now, diligently learning the languages and writing of overseas countries, isn't this different from what Zhong Yi did? However, clinging to the past in the present is not the view of an enlightened person. Recently, with increasing trade between China and foreign countries, navigating the seas and climbing mountains, there is no place unreached. What used to be translated through multiple intermediaries is now as simple as asking someone at the door. If we cannot understand their languages and learn their writing, how can we connect the emotions of China and foreign countries and understand the nature of both Chinese and Westerners? This is why studying Western words and languages is something we dare not delay. Those with foresight fear that the teachings of one Qi person cannot match the clamor of a crowd of Chu people. They propose sending young children abroad to focus on learning, planning for their secure future, and also allowing them to become familiar with local customs to become useful talents and store them for future use. This method can be said to be thorough, and the intention can be said to be beautiful. However, Chinese people often spoil their children. Wealthy families are unwilling to let their children go abroad. Therefore, those sent are mostly sons or younger brothers from poor families. Once they go abroad, their horizons broaden. This is like living in a cave for a long time and suddenly arriving in the countryside, where the world seems different. Furthermore, being far from China, they may not understand the influence of etiquette and righteousness. Therefore, management and education must be handled with great care.</p>

<h3>Rooster – In Memory of Lu Xun's Sixtieth Birthday</h3>
<p>— Xu Yi</p>
<p>Today is the sixtieth anniversary of Lu Xun's birth. As we gaze remotely at the tomb of the teacher, deeply embedded in a demonic atmosphere, do we weep? Do we sigh? Or do we raise high lanterns to celebrate the "posthumous birthday" of our giant?</p>
<p>Sixty years ago today, just as a wicked devil's hand was gripping our country, in a remote corner, a majestic "rooster" was born. That was our mentor, Lu Xun.</p>
<p>Lu Xun was a "rooster." He stood among hundreds of millions of "lazy pigs," awakening them from their slumber every morning. However, the "rooster" finally died from overwork. Will our "lazy pigs" fall into a deep sleep because they no longer hear the rooster's crow?</p>
<p>Ironclad facts tell us: The "lazy pigs," due to the "rooster's" decades of crowing and the lessons of reality, have become accustomed to knowing when to wake up and when to work! They no longer indulge in gluttony and laziness, nor do they fall into a deep sleep. They have transformed into a group of loyal oxen, no, they have transformed into a group of brave roaring lions!</p>
<p>But how should we commemorate this deceased "rooster"? We will never weep, never sigh, but we also know that this is not the time to celebrate with lanterns and decorations. What we must do is learn his spirit of hard work!</p>
<p>"We must dare to laugh, dare to cry, dare to be angry, dare to scold, dare to fight, and in this cursed place, repel that cursed era!"</p>
<p>Family</p>
<h3>The English Family</h3>
<p>— Jiang Yi, sent from London</p>
<p>In an English family, it is common to find only a husband and wife or one or two children. The goal of the English is to enable everyone to build a family for themselves. According to English law, both men and women are considered adults at the age of twenty-one, free to leave their parents and be independent.</p>
<p>Many wealthy English people have at least two houses: one in the countryside and one in the city. But even middle-class families may have a country residence or a seaside cabin in addition to their original home, for weekend and holiday relaxation.</p>
<p>The English are very particular about the architecture of houses and interior decoration and furnishings. Some periodicals are devoted to discussing these issues. Many houses built several eras ago still exist. Their architectural style is based on the royal title of that era. For example, the Victorian era, the Georgian era, the Anne era, the Tudor era, and so on. These types of houses mostly belong to famous aristocratic families. They are very proud of preserving the old architecture and like to talk about the historical value of their houses, thus becoming common conversation topics at their tea parties and banquets.</p>
<p>The owners of such houses often hire a large number of servants. For example, managers, assistants, housekeepers, parlor maids, bedroom maids, cooks, and mansion maids. Although only a few masters live in that large house, all the servants are very busy. In order to preserve the house in its best form, the walls must have decorations from the same era as the house, and the furniture must be matched with the style of the same era. An English friend of mine has a Tudor-era house in the mountains of northern England. I am often invited to stay in that house for a week or two. There are many places there that I find very interesting. The stairs are made of stone. Because they are five or six hundred years old, they have become slippery. People going up and down always have to grab the thick rope hanging next to them. This friend is particularly fond of this mountain house. Although he also has an Anne-era house in London, he does not come to London often.</p>
<p>However, personal preferences are different. Many English people are very trendy. In recent years, many apartment buildings have been built in major cities in England. Almost as soon as each building is completed, many people rush to it. Some rooms have excellent furniture and are decorated in the most popular styles. Some walls are decorated with images of musical stars and Russian rural dolls. The newest style uses very modern square furniture, and the walls are hung with Impressionist, Cubist, or Surrealist paintings. As for the practical style, it uses furniture made of steel and glass. The arrangement is up to the individual. These are just a few examples.</p>
<p>War</p>
<h3>The Great War and Pigeons</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>Modern military communications are constantly changing. In the 19th century, an army traveling twenty miles a day was considered a remarkable record. In the 20th century, an army traveling three hundred miles a day on modern highways is nothing special. As the pace of warfare advances, what used to be counted in weeks and months is now calculated in days and hours. Various tools for transmitting messages, such as wireless telegraphs, broadcasts, and telephones, emerge endlessly. However, wireless communications are often affected by the weather, and telephone lines are subject to damage. Therefore, the ancient means of transportation, military pigeons, have not only not been eliminated on the modern battlefield but have also increased in power.</p>
<p>In modern warfare, the first large-scale use of pigeons was during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. At that time, Paris was besieged, and a large number of pigeons were used to transmit information, but there were only a few hundred. By the time of the last European war, the number of pigeons used by various countries had increased to more than three thousand. As for the beginning of the current war, the military pigeons on the western front were traveling frequently, totaling more than one hundred thousand, which is three times more than during the last European war. The effectiveness they demonstrated even exceeded what wireless communications and telephones could do.</p>
<h3>Opening a Store</h3>
<p>— Ming Xun</p>
<p>If a person is like a store, then physical strength is the capital, knowledge is the partner, credibility is the brand, and conscience, of course, is the store's supervisor.</p>
<p>If there is no capital, the store cannot be opened. Without suitable partners, the store will not be successful. If the brand is not strong, business will never prosper. If the supervisor is too lenient and reverses right and wrong, then the store will become more and more chaotic. As a result, it will inevitably be eliminated and closed.</p>
<h3>Disappointment</h3>
<p>— Fang Jing</p>
<p>Disappointment is the opposite of hope.</p>
<p>Those who truly understand will never be disappointed, because they can accurately grasp their hope.</p>
<p>The disappointment of most people is because their hopes are locked away.</p>
<p>Hawthorne's Detective Work</p>
<h3>The Prima Ballerina's Final Destination</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Four: Several Speculations</p>
<p>Hawthorne suddenly added, "The reason you exclude Lu Jiansheng is because your study of the 'scapegoat psychology' is too thorough! You must know that although there are many scapegoats in the metropolis, they do not all come from the same type. And psychological states are ever-changing. Even the same scapegoat, under different circumstances and situations, will reflect completely different psychological states. You must know that once they 'enter,' they may not be willing to 'exit' at will."</p>
<p>The car stopped again because of the red light. For a moment, I didn't know how to respond to Hawthorne's empty theory. Hawthorne suddenly turned to me and smiled, "Why have you become silent?"</p>
<p>I replied, "I'm quietly listening to your high-minded arguments. Then, do you think Lu Jiansheng is really a suspect?"</p>
<p>As he continued to drive, he smiled again, "Bao Lang, I believe that there is indeed a chasm between a literary mind and a scientific mind. I'm telling you, right now in my mind, everyone is a suspect, and no one is a suspect… Sigh, Yadon is here."</p>
<p>We entered the hotel and first looked for room 774 on the hotel register. Below this number was marked "Jin Jun." I was a little disappointed, but Hawthorne showed no sign.</p>
<p>I whispered, "Could it be that Zhao Boxiong has already moved out?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne replied, "Let's go up and ask. He may be using an alias. Wait, let me make a phone call to Ni Jinshou first."</p>
<p>Hawthorne went to the telephone booth. I waited outside and saw that the number he dialed was the police headquarters. After a while, the line connected.</p>
<p>He said intermittently, "I am Hawthorne. Please connect me to Detective Ni... Not back yet?... Does he have a phone?... What do you mean?... He didn't go to class today... Hmm, hmm... Where did he go at this moment?... Okay." He put the phone down.</p>
<p>When he came back, I whispered to him, "So Yu Gantang didn't go to class today?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne nodded, "Yes, he's not even in the dormitory. Ni Jinshou has already asked several of Yu Gantang's classmates. It is said that he has been missing many classes these days, and his whereabouts are very erratic."</p>
<p>"From this perspective, this person's suspicion seems to have deepened. Is that right?" (64)</p>

<p>The World of Entertainment</p>
<h3>Zachary Scott's Rural Life</h3>
<p>— New Shadow</p>
<p>Hometown Success</p>
<p>Zachary Scott's hometown is Hollywood, and movies are the work he has chosen. Therefore, Hollywood is where he became successful. In his early years, Zachary studied in middle school. Because he knew that the entrance to film companies was not easy to get into, he never thought that he would one day become a movie star. But he had always been fond of theater, especially possessing a talent for acting. He always played important male roles in school plays.</p>
<p>Great Opportunity</p>
<p>From middle school to university, during his four years of university, just like in middle school, he often performed in school plays. One time, the goddess of luck shone on him. In a school play, he played the male lead, opposite a female student, Jane Wyatt. The female lead's father was a film director. He came to the school to watch his daughter act and appreciated Zachary Scott's acting skills, encouraging him to join the film industry after graduation.</p>
<p>Success Story</p>
<p>The director's eye was ultimately correct. Zachary Scott listened to his advice and joined the film industry after leaving school. He rose from an extra to a very important star, progressing smoothly forward. He starred in many films at RKO, MGM, 20th Century Fox, etc., and his performance improved very quickly. He is a person who loves sports. Swimming is his favorite sport. He spends all of his time on the beach. He is also very proficient in tennis and horseback riding.</p>
<p>Rural Life</p>
<p>In recent years, Zachary Scott has been particularly fond of rural life. Near Hollywood, he has twenty acres of farmland, some of which is used as a pasture, and some of which is planted with crops. He does the planting himself. Now he is also teaching this work to his son. When he is not filming, he often stays there with his wife, Elaine Anderson Scott, and children, enjoying family happiness. According to him, his love of rural life is due to heredity; it was inherited from his grandfather.</p>
<h3>"Thinking"</h3>
<p>Cao Yu's trilogy, Thunderstorm, Sunrise, Wilderness, are probably known to all theatergoers. Cao Yu is employed at the Chongqing National Drama College. As school affairs are complex, he has not published any new works for a long time. Recently, it was heard that he has completed two plays: one is "Metamorphosis," which has already been performed in Chongqing and caused a sensation, and the other is a one-act play called "Thinking," which has been sent to Shanghai for publication in the recently published combined issue of Theater Arts, issues 66 and 67. The content depicts a declining traveling troupe. Seeing that their business is bleak, they temporarily change their profession to perform spoken dramas, resulting in many jokes. The whole play is humorous and engaging, a standard excellent farce. Cao Yu's previous works were all serious in style, but this play is a comedy that the playwright considered the most difficult to write. Therefore, it is truly commendable. The play has been designated as the repertoire of the Shanghai Art Theater after their move to a new location in Shanghai. At that time, it will surely cause a sensation among Shanghai's theater fans.</p>
<h3>The Great and Sublime "Confucius"</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>In the past six months, I have often received letters from readers and movie fans asking when "Confucius" will be released and what the plot of this film is like. I answered them, "Minhua's attitude towards the production of "Confucius" is extremely serious, and the director, Fei Mu, is not one to produce inferior works. Although it has taken more than a year, it is still impossible to predict when it will be released. As for the plot, I have not read the script or seen the test footage, so how can I say? But it is safe to say that the awareness is superb, the content is serious, and it is beneficial to the world and people's hearts…"</p>
<p>Recently, I received a micro-letter from Minhua about publishing a special issue for "Confucius," preparing to release it at the Grand Theater in mid-August. This is such a pleasant piece of good news! Ever since domestic films began to tend towards historical dramas, I have not watched them for a long time, to show my personal inclination. But we must make a clear distinction, "Confucius," although a historical drama, should be treated differently. I must sincerely support it. First, because I personally received the teachings of the Sage Teacher since childhood and deeply feel the greatness of Confucianism; second, this film is produced solemnly, breaking the unprecedented record of domestic films. I personally will take this film to see the progress of domestic films.</p>
<p>"Confucius" is the sublime work of domestic historical dramas, worthy of support. This is a common saying among people, not just a personal opinion. I respectfully wish Minhua film production success!</p>
<h3>Folk Films: Xia Xia Not Interested</h3>
<p>— Hai Xing</p>
<p>In the nine folk tale films of the League of Nations, each actor played four or five roles at most, and one or two roles at least. However, Xia Xia missed out and did not have a role in any of them. It is said that this is Xia Xia's request. Because she is physically weak, she cannot endure the rush of filming. At the same time, she is not interested in folk tales. When she made this request to Zhang Shankun, Zhang said that he would never force her. Therefore, Xia Xia had no roles. It is rumored that Xia Xia is already tired of the film life because the roles she is assigned on the screen are often elderly women, such as Yue Mu in "Serving the Country Faithfully." She believes that these roles cannot allow her to fully express herself. In the future, Xia Xia will change her style and show off her skills on the stage.</p>

<p>Game 192: Single Horse Captures the Scholar</p>
<p>Red to move and win</p>
<p>I have repeatedly received letters from readers asking about the moves for a single horse capturing a lone scholar. According to this set of moves, it is actually extremely easy, but many beginners make idle moves, or even have no way to win. Therefore, I have specially drawn the diagram above. Following the chess position in the diagram, you can definitely reach it. You only need the red to move nine steps to capture the scholar. The moves are as follows:</p>
<p>General 5 advances 1, Guard 4 advances 1, Horse 7 advances 6, Guard 4 retreats 1, Horse 6 retreats 4</p>
<p>Advisor 6 retreats 5, Horse 4 retreats 5, Guard 4 advances 1, Horse 5 advances 3, Advisor 5 advances 6</p>
<p>Horse 3 retreats 4, Advisor 6 retreats 5, Horse 4 advances 6, Advisor 5 retreats 6, Horse 6 advances 8</p>
<p>Advisor 6 advances 5, Horse 8 advances 7, Guard 4 retreats 1, Horse 7 retreats 5 (Win)</p>
<p>Solution to the Heavenly Net and Earthly Cage Moves (Zheng He)</p>
<p>Chariot 4 moves to 5, Chariot 2 advances 6, Cannon 2 moves to 4, Advisor 5 retreats 4, Chariot 5 advances 1</p>
<p>Chariot 2 moves to 4, Chariot 5 advances 1, Pawn 4 moves to 3, Chariot 5 retreats 7, Advisor 4 advances 5</p>
<p>Horse 2 retreats 3, Chariot 7 retreats 6, Chariot 5 advances 8, Chariot 4 advances 1, Chariot 5 retreats 8</p>
<p>Chariot 7 advances 6, Chariot 5 moves to 6, Pawn 3 moves to 4, Cannon 4 moves to 2, General 6 moves to 5</p>
<p>Cannon 2 retreats 8, Chariot 7 moves to 5, Chariot 1 advances 9, General 5 advances 1, Cannon 2 moves to 6</p>
<p>Chariot 5 advances 1, Marshal 4 advances 1, Chariot 5 moves to 4 (Draw)</p>
<p>Chen Guohe and Gu Fohai were the first to guess correctly and will each receive a chess manual.</p>
<h3>Idle Talk from Hut Qi</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>Watching Bai Yuyan Perform "Da Chu Shou"</p>
<p>"Da Chu Shou" (Fighting Hand-to-Hand) is the special skill of a Wudan (female martial role). After Jiu Zhenfeng, there was Zhu Guifang. Both of them exhausted the skills of "Da Chu Shou." Currently, those who are good at this skill include Yan Shishan and Song Dezhu. The above-mentioned people are all male actors who play Wudan. Except for Jiu Zhenfeng, there is quite a lot of strength, but not enough grace. The physical condition of men makes this unavoidable. The only woman who practices Wudan and can perform Da Chu Shou is Fen Juhua. Although Fen Juhua plays Wudan as a woman, she also feels that she has more strength than grace. It is known that the beauty of combining strength and gentleness is very difficult for anyone, male or female, to possess. But yesterday I happened to be summoned by Mei Jun to watch Kunling Bai Yuyan perform Jinshan Temple, actually performing Da Chu Shou, and performing it wonderfully. There is a move in which she sits diagonally on the ground and uses a fake small foot to bounce back the spear thrown by the lower court's door god, which can be named "Magpie Kicking a Branch." This "Magpie Kicking a Branch" has a handsome posture, accurate vision, and stable foot strength. It is truly a wonderful product. What is commendable is that it combines strength and grace and can be called a giant of the female Da Chu Shou. Her costume is very beautiful. Her face is long, her eyes are quite beautiful, her nose is good, and her teeth are also good. However, she needs to add more vitality to her expressions for her demeanor to become more vivid. She should study her pronunciation and enunciation more. The Kunqu melody and singing method are not suitable for women's high voices. It is not her fault that she does not sing loudly. Before that, there was also Tan Mu, where she played the princess. It is a pity that I did not get to listen to it. It must be better than the Zuihua Yin suite sung in Jinshan Temple, it can be asserted. The little Lianying who accompanied her as Qing'er is also a Kun female role. Her costume and movements are good. Her eyebrows move frequently, and her posture is flexible, similar to Zhang Wenyuan in her prime. She is also only seventeen or eighteen years old, so there is no fear that she will not become a good role in the future. There are many talented female actors, and they are even more prevalent in recent years. Within a month, I inadvertently saw two talented Kun female actors, so I am happy to record this. Kunqu opera performances burn incense and use water, mainly singing, with absolutely no "Da Chu Shou." When Ping opera troupes perform it, Wudan, who knows Da Chu Shou, is played, which adds this martial art. It is said that Jiu Zhenfeng started it, but this matter remains to be investigated.</p>
