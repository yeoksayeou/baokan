<p>近頃歐西軍事仍在沉寂之中，但經濟戰則頗現緊張景象。英國爲了加緊對於德國的經濟封鎖，嚴厲制止德國凡百貨品的輸出，於是宣佈運往義國的德煤亦在違禁之列，應予扣留；因而自荷蘭國洛特丹港駛出的義國運煤船多艘，在英國海軍實行檢查的步驟之下，全數被截。自本問題發生後，義國政府已向英政府提出抗議，認爲英國此項行為，實與一九三八年成立的英義協定相抵觸，對於義國的經濟發展，有重大關係；且認爲現行國際公法對於各中立國商務利益訂有保障辦法，今英政府竟檢查截留義國所購煤斤，實與國際公法的精神相違背云。英政府對此抗議，日內即將答覆；據昨日所傳，英國措辭極溫和，而其論據則聲明英王詔書的一視同仁，且謂如此辦法，在上次歐戰中即已實行，當時義國與此平行辦理，故有先例可援云。預料此里賓特洛浦洽於此際赴義國，更難免予義國的對英態度以何種影響。很可能的，此事成爲導火綫，影響及於義大利與歐戰的前途。</p>
<p>歐洲諸大強國中，義大利缺煤最多，本國產量每年約僅二百餘萬噸；且煤質低劣，不能應用於重要工業，故必須購求之於外國。在上次歐洲大戰時，義國的煤斤供應問題已有嚴重現象，何况經二十五年而至今日，義國工業化的程度已較前大增，煤的需要與消耗量當然劇增。考之近年統計，義大利由外國輸入煤斤的總數，每年約在一千二百萬到一千三百萬噸之間。現在輸入的德煤被扣，當然不能視爲義國所需煤斤的來源斷絕，甚至發生何種經濟生產國民生活上的重大困難？但是不能不視爲對義國的深刻刺激。</p>
<p>原來義國所需煤斤，有半數以上取給於德奧；例如一九三八年，義國輸入煤一千二百萬噸，其中七百萬噸來自德奧；此外，則自波蘭輸入一百六十萬噸；自捷克輸入五十四萬噸。現在奧國與波蘭與捷史，均已相繼淪陷於德國的直接管轄之下，所以義大利之所不足，可謂百分之八十左右依賴德國。及至戰事爆發，德國一面因爲自身需要的激增，一面雙因爲運煤赴義國，遭遇了若干事實上交通上的困難，但其間還有他種因素，使德義兩國之供需勉力維持，未嘗中斷。今者，英國爲加緊對德經濟戰爭，禁止德貨外輸起見，在公海上截留了義國運煤船，施行檢查，阻止運輸；這在英國方面的本意，祇在打擊德國的貿易，並非與義國爲難；但煤之爲物，對於經濟生產與國民生活，尤對於重工業，不但需要，并且一日不可短少，一日不可間斷；則不問被扣後別籌補求，儘有其可能，但目前一時的影響，亦即可以視爲異常嚴重。義大利政府現在正採取沉着緘默的態度，靜候英國政府的覆文，以決定今後的行動。今後行動究將如何決定，絕難預料，但因此藉口而採取任何行動，俱非意外。</p>
<p>我們暫時不必假定義國如何行動，且更不妨從最和善的方面着想。即德義運煤的海道，雖被英國遮斷，但德義之間尙有陸上交通綫，則德煤運義，尙非絕無辦法。然考察以往的統計，德義間的鐵道運輸，有其甚小的限度。兩國若要增加鐵道運煤量，困難實甚；蓋德義雙方均無大批載重貨車，可供運煤；且阿爾卑斯山脈橫貫其間，鐵道交通綫上受此自然障礙而不能大量載煤。歷來上西利亞，波蘭及捷克等處運煤到義大利，均取道詢問幾尼亞，斯旦丁，或漢堡諸地的海上交通綫。試思舍近取遠，舍速取緩，舍陸取海，以種種不經濟而猶不得不然，則其鐵道運煤的困難，自是可想而知了。雖一年以來歐陸政治局勢的劇變，已使德義兩國的空間，更爲接近；若使設法改進波希米亞與奧地的鐵道設備與效能，在政治上旣具有其可能，亦即確乎遠較一年之前爲方便；若此則德義兩國間的陸上運輸量自應可望劇增。但是，德國早已悉索敝賦以赴戰爭，據聞竭力維持其所有之交通機構，旣有捉襟見肘之象；然則列謀改進，更謀建義，以冀擴展對義運輸，殆在事實上有所難能，有所不暇；即使能之，亦是緩不濟急。從這一點說來，或得相反的結論，即義大利或將以中立國恣態，準備與英國改進商業協定，從而獲得所需之煤，也不是絕無其可能的。</p>
<p>在戰爭期間，各交戰國與中立國間發生外交爭議，原屬極平凡的現象；此次英國阻止德煤輸義，致與義大利發生糾紛，自亦未足爲怪。至於目前的義大利，它的國際政策是所謂不參加戰爭，這與一般所謂中立，意態上有其微妙的不同之處；同時，德義軸心的基礎依然存在，義國尤得每事以其本國利益爲前提而儘量發揮其特殊地位，運用其特殊機會。這當然不能謂爲義大利乃得儘量機詐，逞所意願；因爲英法方面戰時的弱點，與義大利一般的弱點，亦屬遽難比較，斷言於孰能較佔優勢；何况德蘇方面的眞實力量，根本尙無可信的估計，西綫軍事又沉悶相持，參見分曉。故義大利需煤難亟，若謂爲了扣煤而便與英國關係惡劣至無可收拾，雖非絕不可能，亦非必然趨勢。</p>

<p>瑞典京城　芬京來訊稱、目前之和議若吿失敗、則芬軍將傾其全力輔以外國允許之援助、而取新的主動地位、前在瑞典京城之芬蘭政治家今已離去、聞前任芬蘭總統斯文赫夫伏特與戰前辦理對蘇談判之巴錫基維亦皆離此、據此間觀察家之意見、除芬政府官員與蘇聯要人外、與和議有關者尙有許多方面、如芬軍即其一也、任何政府若接受芬軍所不贊同之條件、則其處境將感困難、而德英法之態度亦有關係、此乃瑞典尤常注意之因素、同時芬蘭公報措辭雖樂觀、但分蘭戰局似未能使人完全寬懷、蓋其繼續抵抗力、視其所接外國有效的援助之迅速而定也、頃據官塲聲稱、瑞京與歐洲各國間之電話交通、昨因防杜驚入謠諑傳播於外而中斷者、今已恢復、（九日路透電）</p>
<h3>不自由母寗死芬人之悲壯語</h3>
<p>倫敦　「泰晤士報」登有駐芬京訪員來電稱、和平條件倘具有辱國性質、則該國大部份民衆仍决心捍衛自由與獨立、「某要人會語余云、芬蘭當繼續作戰、即使此種作戰等於自殺、亦所不顧、吾人在殉國之前、亦當先將妻室擊斃、以免落於敵人之手、但吾人在出此下策之前、尙能作戰一年之久、即使芬蘭終於淪亡、此種忠勇壯烈之苦戰情形、亦必能留芳百世、而西歐各太邦不加援手、則將遺臭萬年」云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>瑞典官方聲明　僅居中人地位　切望芬能保持獨立自由　戰事行長勢難置身事外</h3>
<p>瑞典京城　瑞典官方人士昨日發表關於瑞典調解蘇芬衝突之談話、宣稱、瑞典政府幷未以任何壓力加諸芬蘭、其所負擔之工作、不啻外交上之傳郵、瑞典之亟望以芬蘭可堪接受之條件、獲得蘇芬戰事和平之解決、乃屬無可諱言、瑞典深願爲技術上之居間調人、將蘇聯提議轉達芬蘭政府、此項要求經蘇聯政府提交瑞典駐蘇公使後、已由瑞典京城轉送芬蘭政府、瑞典政界人士對於莫斯科方面難與芬京政府進行談判一事、極表重視、因蘇俄前於戰事初起時、曾扶植由古錫寗任總理之芬「人民政府」今與芬京重開談判、即表示「人民政府」之如曇花一現也、（九日海通電）</p>
<p>瑞典京城　漢森總理機關報「社會民主報」頃就蘇芬兩國戰事發表一文、略謂、蘇芬兩國之問、樹立光榮的和平、俾芬蘭保持獨立自由、此實斯堪的那維亞半島各國主要利益所在、「蓋戰事愈延長、則　典乃至整個斯堪的那維亞半島即愈難置身事外、西方各國倘若出而干涉、吾人何去何從、即絕少抉擇餘地、質言之、吾人他日倘若被迫而決定態度、則全國人民白分之九十九之意向如何、吾人實已知之甚諗、但百分之九十九之國民莫不切望避免此種兩難局勢、則亦吾人所深知也、至以現行和平談判而論、其性質至爲脆弱、要屬實在情形、因此吾人未可過份樂觀、仍應以全力支持芬蘭、幷將本國之抵抗力量、加强至最高限度」云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>荷京　「電聞報」頃載有駐芬京訪員來電稱、「瑞典所具態度、已使芬蘭人民感覺苦悶、彼等咸信芬蘭之前途如何、在廣大範圍之內、當以瑞典是否願在軍事上予以援助爲斷至瑞典所由出面調處者、揣其用意、乃欲使英法兩國不致大規模援助芬蘭、以免瑞典國捲入漩渦」云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　此間瑞典人士頃談稱、該國政府此次在出面調處芬蘭蘇聯兩國爭端之前、曾以此意吿知土耳其政府、瑞典駐英公使在上星期中、曾與土國駐英大使署魯舒第進行談話、即與此事有關、此在外交界人士則謂、關於芬蘇兩國和平方案、除各報所載者外、其眞實內容如何、外間尙鮮聞知、無論如何最後決定之權、仍當操之芬蘭、截至目下爲止、該國當局似尙未作何決定云（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>蘇聯曾請英　出百斡旋　當被英方拒絕</h3>
<p>倫敦　關於蘇芬兩國進行和議事、此間消息靈通人士頃談稱、旬日之前、蘇聯駐英大使邁斯基曾詢問外務部當局、願吾以該國和平條件轉達芬蘭政府、但外務部當局認爲其所述條件內容、碍難接受、僅允轉吿芬蘭政府、謂蘇聯已有媾和建議提出、而不願代爲轉達、此外幷聞邁斯基大使曾向外務部當局聲明、蘇聯未與德國成立政治協定或軍事同盟條的、但英國仍拒不出任調處、該大使當時頗爲不愉云、至以瑞典出面斡旋而論、實乃德蘇兩國共同壓迫之結果、大抵各該國曾向端典發出警吿、謂蘇聯對於斯堪的那維亞半島各國原未抱有何種野心、但瑞典倘成爲英法兩國之工具、而拒不以壓迫加諸芬蘭、則德蘇兩國實逼處此、即當聯合加以對付、查蘇聯政府此次所提出之和平條件、共中幷未涉及埃倫特羣島不得設防一項問題、此其用意、乃在見好瑞國、自可不言而喩、瑞典政府在此種利誘威脅之情勢下、終于以蘇聯之和平條件轉交芬蘭、芬蘭政府雖極不歡迎、但因瑞典當局之力勸、始允派遣代表團前往莫斯科進行談判、總而言之、蘇聯顯欲及早結束芬蘭戰事、此其原因、由于軍事行動之進展遲緩者少、而由于憂懼英法兩國之積極干涉者多、若謂該國可因此减低其要求、則殊未必、無論如何、英法兩國仍準備加緊援助芬蘭、但一切仍聽由該國自行決定、所遺憾者瑞典處于德國直接威脅之下、其所推行之「中立政策」、已使英法兩國之援助芬蘭、遭遇種種困難、而芬蘭政府之左右爲難、自可想像得之云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>莫斯科電臺　停止反芬節目</h3>
<p>倫敦　莫斯科無綫電昨晚未言及蘇芬戰事、自蘇芬戰舉爆發起、每日用外國語廣播之反芬節目、現亦停止、（九日路透電）</p>
<h3>如接獲正式申請　英法當以實力援芬　芬蘭運命聽任芬人自決　斷不容許德功支配北歐</h3>
<p>巴黎　此間消息靈通方面稱、英法關於現所進行之和平談判、不欲以壓力加諸芬蘭、如芬蘭願協的國繼續予以援助、則祗須一言、協的國即準備有以應之、衆覺瑞典政府在本國與世界輿情之前、已負甚大責任、瑞典以其與情關係、聞已對芬蘭大施壓力、並作停止目前間接援助之暗示、聞蘇聯新要求不啻將芬蘭置於慕尼黑會議後之捷克地位、其所要求者、包括貝柴摩區連同鎳鑛與漁權之割讓、沿海各砲台之拆除、以暨維堡與拉多加湖芬蘭全部土地之放棄、「巴黎時報」稱、此事當由芬人自決之、芬人所須知者、英法固準備予以更大而更直接之援助也、洪水不可分、故納粹之禍與蘇聯之禍亦不可分離、此亦爲芬人以及刻在戰爭邊綫上躊躇顧慮之各國人土所當記憶者也云、據聞英法運往芬蘭之軍用品，連已交與在途者在內共有飛機四百零五架、其中轟炸機六十七架、又砲九百十六尊·砲彈二百五十餘萬個、輕機關槍五千挺·重機關槍一百二十四挺·平射砲一百五十尊·炸彈四十五萬枚·水雷一千零五十枚·地雷一萬枚·槍彈五六千萬發、上述各軍用品現已繳者至少有三分之二、（九日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　倫敦官方聞蘇芬即將議和之謠傳甚盛、大爲震動、權威方面意見、以爲蘇德二國支配斯堪的那維亞諸國、即係協的國之失敗、彼等有此憂慮、其所根據之理由如下、（一）蘇德一國支配芬蘭以及斯堪的那維亞半島之後、即能從瑞典之加利佛·吉露那·以及吉露那伐拉三處、取得其所需之鐵礦、此三處乃世界第三產鐵區也、（二）德國北部海岸、殆可絕對不受協的國之攻襲、從經濟方面立論、該處乃德國最有價値之地也、（三）蘇俄旣免於戰事、即能與德合作、開採原料運德、同時又可守護德國之巴爾幹邊境、若干觀察者均預料協的國必有一日假道彼處以攻德國也、（四）奧大利捷克以及波蘭相繼崩潰之後、巴爾幹諸國對於芬蘭之結果、注視甚切、今芬蘭倘亦崩潰、則此諸國信任協的國之心、必將較前冷淡、蓋協的國向被認爲與芬蘭休戚相關者也、（五）若芬蘭屈服、而受德蘇二國之支配、則德蘇二國或將迫令挪威、允許德人使用在丹麥之梅空根據地、俾可由該處進攻英國之北海艦隊、此亦可能之事也、總之、歐洲全部戰局之複雜情况、或將因此後二三星期內芬蘭之決斷、而有改變之可能、至於主持此項和戰大計者、當係孟納興上將、（國際社九日電）</p>
<p>哥本哈根　據權威方面報告、芬蘭擬在數小時內決定、直接向英法二國、請求各派援軍、以禦紅軍之侵略、此項消息如果屬實、則戰事即有波及斯堪的那維亞諸國之可能、據倫敦方面之快報、謂英國正向瑞典要求、許其假道運兵、果爾、則此間以爲英國希望芬蘭乞援之意見、即可證實、據可靠方面謂、芬蘭之是否出此一策、須觀瑞典之能否調和蘇芬衝突而定、瑞典之任務、爲使蘇聯提出之條件、更近於芬蘭所可接受之程度、而使芬蘭所可接受者、更近於蘇聯所要求之程度、苟蘇聯之要求不能大事减削、或挪威與瑞典不遺有力之援軍至芬、則一般人士皆料、芬蘭必將向協約國直接乞援、且信協的國必不拒絕、（國際社特派員福察麥九日電）</p>

<p>瑞典京城　柏林各外國觀察家頃談稱、德國政界人士對於該國與瑞典聯合調處芬蘇兩國戰爭一說、均予以否認、但調英法兩國倘若派遣軍隊或　顧兵直接援助芬蘭、德國當　爲西歐各國意欲擴大戰爭範圍、而造成反德國之新戰綫、果兩則一般局勢必將完全改觀、德政府自不得不準備採取必要之決定云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>糧食　洋米連跌又小兩元　到源甚旺今日又有七萬包　星期停市米業已在醞釀中</h3>
<p>邇來米市運朝暴跌、已成一蹶不振之勢、誠以本月期貨絡繹湧到、銀根周轉維艱、懷貨者難以扳守、市貨擁擠異常、作客目見市面變化暴烈、都具戒心、是以昨晨開手、喊聲即低半元、無如人心日疲、致米價愈跌愈暴、迄午市收盤、除混合碎以存底不充、銷路較廣、略能拷住、見落半元至元殂、高自三十五元、次至三十四元外、其他各色洋米、又猛削元半至二元不等、一號西貢已爲四十四元、四十三元半、二號西貢高自四十一元、决至四十元、火絞高貨賓塔牌四十二元半、雜牌四十二元、二號　羅三十九元三五角、小絞三十　元三十八元八角、東京砶尖三十八元二角、三十八元、且視大局趨勢、人心已頹、尙在望小、况銷路日見减稀、一時希其轉機、似頗不易、而其續步跌風、或屬意想中事、</p>
<p>洋米　售、亦爲浮戶散客與財力薄弱之行囤、均已感覺銀根之壓迫、更以國外頻頻報小、洋商兜售二號西貢已不到五十元、一號西貢亦低五十二三元、雖行商不敢續定、而市面與人心更多一壓迫、因此晨間開市後、市塲中賣氣極旺、高决各洋米莫不在瀉而下、比之前日較小元外至二元不等、回籠期貨亦乏受主、三月份暹羅二號自四十九元六角小至四十九元、又小絞小至四十八元二角、亦小元外、成交不足二百噸、現洋米亦祗三千多包、</p>
<p>洋米又有續到、怡和洋行怡生輪自海防運來六千六百五十六包、又從香港裝來七千五百八十八包、共計一萬四千二百四十四包、已於昨晨進口、停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、本報昨載之渣華公司經理之輿別林輪在西貢裝米七萬一千餘包來滬、原定昨日到埠、茲據該公司昨接該　電吿、須今日始可進口、仍照預定停靠虹口公和祥碼頭起卸、（祖）</p>
<p>糯米續被洋米影響、去路平淡、行情跟落半元次至一元、厚薄粳　國米、其來源邇米旣又以種種困難、突吿寥落、昨則仍在此種狀態中、由虹口區轉出者尙祇三五百包、且多屬昔日棧存之貨、其新到者僅丹陽等白元五六車而已、不過傳說太倉區一帶之貨、不日或有疏通之望、　得實現、亦誠民食之福、至於塲外暗盤、聞仍　羽、衹南港早晚稻略有做開、價爲四十五元、因此貨價格最低、一般店舖頗合應付門市、故能較厚粳去路爲易云云、</p>
<p>小廣寒米市塲、各同業爲因每逢星期日、各堆棧悉屬封關、無法扦樣、對於營業往往無形停　、殊感不便、特照雜糧公會星期日休假前例、擬於下星期日起、每屆星期日休業一天、得以便於整理營業、故昨各該同業簽字贊成此舉者有九十餘家、已佔全同業二分之二、祇待該公會開會通過、即可通吿實行、</p>
<h3>廠粉無變化　回籠貨略有起伏　蘇麥跌至廿三元</h3>
<p>粉市初疲後穩、查一號粉廠盤、在平賣期內、已無變更之可言、而回籠貨則隨銷化情形、而略有呼吸、昨老車牌棧單上午開過十四元二角半、後因內地鄕莊稍動、價復回高十四元三角及三角半、聞綠砲車價爲十四元六角半、但無正式市面、此種環境、恐尙有一度醞釀、十日有粉二百四十包運厦門、</p>
<p>小麥交易、依然清閑、華廠與出口幫均鮮垂青、日廠亦思抑價而取、故全日間僅開蘇州麥一二車、價爲二十三元、比前日開價已跌去八角、其他各貨槪無妥交、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆漲風　不可抵制</h3>
<p>黃豆　市况一度趨跌後、近兩日實銷開展、一般投機者乘勢騷動、市塲中人心興　、搶　子勢又盛行、市情拉抬頗烈、昨市更見騰踊、蚌埠豆最高價又達二十四元、做開七八車、價自二十一元四角至二十四元、丁家州豆成交一千三百餘包、價爲二十四元八角至二十五元三角、蕪湖豆八百餘包、價爲二十元零五角至二十三元、南京豆四百餘包、價爲十九元五角至二十二元五角滁州豆一車、價爲二十二元五角、桑園豆一百包、價爲十九元五角、靑島豆二百包、價爲二十九元、銷塲爲囤戶占去四分之一、其餘由榨油廠車坊本街南洋等走化云、</p>
<p>出口　雜糧、今（十日）有豆子六百托十五包、又生仁五百九十五包、及豆餅一千五百張、供　廈門、又有豆子六百四十五包、及生油四百八　聽、運往香港、運新加坡者、祗豆子五百二十包、</p>
<h3>金融　滙市岑寂　趨勢平穩</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、因受海外美對英匯兌竟復轉向下、暴跌四分之多、故本市匯豐、美匯掛牌、遂縮小〇六二五、退達六元半、荷呂日等匯亦略見掛小、他如英匯等則尙平定、內盤半天悄况、仍頗沉寂、潛勢仍穩、蓋日來無論國內外消息均頗良好、且當日港電稍有吐塞、故市勢穩中微硬、至晨開復呈英平美緊之故態、英仍計四辦士一二五、美則爲六元六八七五、開後洋行稍扒、但無影響、旋有港電吐出於先、錢兌業跟塞繼後、情勢遂現稍鬆、此後買賣雙方、觀望不前、成交更吿淸稀、遂於平定狀態下收盤、價爲四辦士一四〇六二五及六元七一八七五、結果比上日英鬆〇一五六二五、美緊〇三一二五、期貨趨勢與現貨相同、</p>
<p>英鬆而美略緊</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近期漲一八七五、遠期升二五、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美滬法等各滙俱平、美對英猛跌四分、對滬未更、對法暴落二分二五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士一二五、美滙六元六八七五、較之前收、英平美緊〇六二五、乃匯兌降落之故、開後洋行首先扒入匯豐現貨英金四辦士一二五、供求平衡、缺乏變化、不久港電稍有塞出、故市面遂形微硬、計售　外行現貨英金四辦士一四〇六二五、斯時美匯六兀七一八七五難結、滙豐掛脾揭曉、英平美縮〇六二五、白銀平衡稅揭曉大〇·七五、此後錢兌業亦跟跡賣予華義某行等美金票六元八一二五、致市勢續吿略鬆、英金四辦士一四〇六二五、及美匯六元七一八七五、已可結得、後洋行界復來結進某行本月份美匯六元六八七五、嗣後成交更淸、爲狀呆平、迨至午收、英金四辦士一四〇六二五、美匯六元七一八七五、本月份英金四辦士一二五美匯六元六八七五、下月期英金四辦士〇七八一二五、美匯六元五九三七五、給果比上日現期英鬆〇一五六二五、美緊○三一二五、午後週六無市、</p>
<p>香港九日（週六）電、今晨滙市開盤動盪不安、英匯現貨初開不動、遠期緊〇三一二五、爲一先令二便士八一二五、美匯現貨猛縮三一二五、爲二十四元、申滙現貨降二元五角爲三百五十六元五角、日滙現貨亦緊一元、爲一百〇二元二五、十時市面微軟、英滙現貨緊〇三一二五、爲一先令二便士八一二五、遠期不動申匯現貨回升一元、爲二百五十七元半　十時四十五分市面重吿不安、英滙現貨回鬆〇三一二五、爲一先令二便士八四三七五、美匯現貨亦回長〇六二五、爲二十四元〇六二五、申滙現貨重降一元、爲三百五十六元五角、十一時三十分吿平、各滙槪無變動、下午週六無市、</p>
<p>天津英滙徵鬆</p>
<p>天津九日（週六）電、今晨匯市開盤告平、英滙現貨微鬆〇三一二五、爲二便士七五、美匯現貨及申匯均無榮辱、仍爲六元〇六二五、及一百十元七角五分、「聯鈔」暗盤回賤一元、爲一百〇三元、</p>
<h3>金市無大起伏　半天祇十四元上落</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、依舊盤旋、變動可謂極微、以先漲而後回挫、結果較隔昨稍高、良以港帮逢低搜羅所致、晨開爲四千七百八十五元、計大九元、原因美滙報緊、及某銀樓等代港帮收買、繼有某錢兌業跟進、再漲五元、升達四千七百九十元、旋某掮客代大連帮沽出、某銀號亦賣、且斯時外匯略告轉硬、故難站定原狀、一度盤小至四千七百七十六元、顧以港帮乘低復來活動、故收盤尙有四千七百八十元、較上日好起四元、午後週六無市、而塲外亦鮮聞做開、半天交易的千兩光景、銀樓飾金呆定、海關金等仍平、　自晨每條（十兩）、初開因美匯報緊、加之香港帮首來購買、故局勢堅穩、開市即抬高九元、某銀樓進銀號五十兩、爲四千七百八十五元、少頃某錢兌業亦來跟進、遂再提高五　、錢兌業進金號五十兩、爲四千七百九十元、嗣因某掮客突來猛塞、且美匯略報回硬，英金反吿徵鬆、故某銀　及證券報等亦互相吐出、而港帮吃胃轉呆、滬步回挫現金號出錢兌業十兩、遜爲四千七百七十六元、此後賣者漸少、而港帮乘低復來吸收、重又拉起八元、某銀　進證券　五十兩、爲四千七百八十四元、卒因港帮吃胃已足、銀樓帮及某銀號等復來拋售、再又回落四元、某銀號出錢兌業三十兩、爲四千七百八十元作午收價、結果此上日軋漲四元、半天祗上四元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高數元、牧進减低二十元、現　金照掛脾金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金仍未更動</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、續吿平定、大同行仍懸四百八十五元、新同行與上價相同、收進的减小十五元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣勢銷轉緊</h3>
<p>昨日外幣、英美金鎊、供求稀少市况穩定、英美金票交易未盛、英金票仍爲五十五元、美金票因鎊匯速降、市價稍緊、晚市爲十四元六角五分、香港票稍鬆軟、新加坡票荷蘭票需要見增、斐律濱票亦趨堅秀日金票稍弱、晚市爲一元二角九分四厘、朝鮮票微疲、晚市爲一元零一分三厘、昨日市價、美金票升二分、香港票降五厘、法郎票升一厘、新加坡票荷蘭票斐律賓票俱升五分、安南票升二分其他各幣未更、</p>
<h3>證券　洋股平穩　內債盤旋</h3>
<p>昨日統一公債暗盤市况、蓋以近來銀根緊縮、買戶以頭襯與抵押上利息負擔之關係、以致裏足不前、乃空方雖繫於南京謠不時深機拋塞、但一般洞悉謠言之無謂、零星散多、則納意頗覺有勁、是以進出相埒、乃遺成微波蕩漾之勢、全日上落狹小僅伸縮於一二角之間、獨乙種爲除中籤價格遂軋小八角、其他則參差於五分一角間、成交未增、仍約五十萬元左右、</p>
<p>股票交易、三友實業社股五十股、價爲一三元五〇、</p>
<p>昨日衆業公所股市、開盤續形平穩、雖有浮多因週末關係、出而了結、多方吸胃甚、交易因以激增、買戶定單源源而來、價格冉冉趨高、上海銀公司·英聯·會德豐·鋼業·及怡和等成交最爲熱鬧、價格俱有進展、橡皮股穩定、</p>
<p>倫敦八日（週五）電、今日英商遠東各公司股票掛牌行市、父見漲風、滙豐銀行英倫註册股漲一鎊半、價爲九十三鎊半、又香港註册股跟升半鎊、價爲九十二鎊半、有利銀行股升二先令六便士爲十二鎊十二先令六便士、開平煤礦股續漲三便士、價爲十八先令六便士、古拉客林傍橡皮股微跌一便士半、爲二十一先令十便士半、其餘吿平、</p>
<p>倫敦八日（週五）電、今中國外債掛牌行市略有波動、漲跌不一、英德續借款（英發）回漲二鎊、爲五十九鎊、中法美金（有印）微升半鎊、價爲五十一鎊半、津浦鐵路原續借款均跌半鎊、價爲十三鎊、其餘吿平、</p>
<h3>紗花　棉紗底盤不謂小　逢漲不乏新賣戶</h3>
<p>紗市堅而挺、趨勢平穩、但升降範圍甚狹、此內外滙寗靜、以致人心安定、同時實銷雖無大量的發展、惟港帮方面零星採辦、續而不斷、三月份二十支雙馬紗、大戶業已將定額扒淸、據其意態、謂原料暫無鬆落之望、然拋空者因其底槃不能算小、所以漲價時新賣者亦不乏人也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開人氣平平、少頃聞外滙改縮、買風又熾、三月期二十支雙馬開價爲九百十二元、直漲至十四元、此時買戶依然不絕、但客帮稍有吐出、故擯持已久、迨至收盤以後、又見昂張、查半日間成交統計二千〇四十五包、行情二十支雙馬現貨漲三四元、今日有紗五十件運香港、一百七十七件運厦門、茲將各帮口買去之額量錄左、</p>
<p>香港　二七五　同行一、七〇〇</p>
<p>內地　四五　四川　二〇</p>
<p>廈門　五　統計二、〇四五</p>
<h3>本棉貨少　不易發展　同業移注於印棉</h3>
<p>本棉交易轉趨淸淡、但行悄依然堅挺如恒、查生意之少的原因、謂執貨者不願脫售之故、又値週　關係、所以成交减少、近聞各花號鑒於貨物缺少、在本棉上難以發展、紛紛向海外購訂印棉做交易、據云購訂之數貴、日見增進、效將現綿成交情形列左、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日殊爲靜寂、又因南方帮之在市套賣、及一部份之海外棉商在市拋賣、結果昨日棉市收盤價格、較之上日近期跌六七磅音、遠期跌三磅音、印度棉市日來因紗廠罷工之故、現貨交易靜寂、加之各方多頭了結、市况頗呈疲乏之狀、昨日　同預測猛跌六羅比餘，埃及十餘磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日較爲靜寂、同業間對於印棉之價落、昨忽袖手不購、藍因深恐印度之再跌也、廠方則始終淡薄、諒以日來到貨甚擠之故、茲將昨日棉市以美匯六元七一八七五折合送廠價如下、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布客銷　又見熱鬧</h3>
<p>布市明鬆暗緊、雖以銀根及堆儲困難等關係、浮多未易堅持、而一般貨戶、態度仍形鎭靜、廠方以製造費用日增、開價奇昂、囤戶納胃、似已飽滿、掉出掉進交易居多、本街及客帮、如西南滇粵閩浙東客銷、雖均有進展、而以市上存底太厚、影響市面尙徵、各貨漲跌、互有參差、甬地以內陸交通漸復、昨續辦細斜·細布·組布·近二百件、閩粵帮辦府綢·花布·漂布·色布一百數十件、滇帮辦色布·綫呢一百餘箱、皖北辦色布漂布·印花布五千餘疋、南洋帮辦四千餘疋、本街成交五百餘件、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖價升降互見</h3>

<h3>洋米按日到滬　米價逐跌　西貢米價下降　滬市步趨跌勢</h3>
<p>昨日又有洋米一萬四千二百四十四包進口、係怡和洋行怡生輪、自海防裝六千六百五十六包、在香港運來七千五百八十八包、於昨晨黎明進口、停　羅斯福碼頭起卸、昨報所載渣華郵船公司經理之奧別林號輪、自西貢裝來洋米七萬一千餘包、原定昨日到滬、至傍晚尙未見進口、後據該公司云、該輪須今日始可到埠、仍停靠虹口公和祥碼頭起卸、</p>
<p>人口减少</p>
<p>自下月停止平糶消息傳播後、社會人士、對今後食糧之來源及價格、頗爲　念、米業中人云、以後米價、尙有繼續下跌趨勢、緣以前來源、十之匕八、全恃國米、十之二三、爲購洋米、彼時因訂購洋米、頗爲　難、形成公開之秘密、而國　來源、因受限制而不暢通、是以造成操縱囤積機會、今則適反是蓋恃訂購洋米者、已十之七八而希望國米者、不過十之二三耳、况向西貢訂購之價格、全視外滙之漲落而定高低、已成完全公開之買賣、任何人可以訂國、不若以前之暗市交易、囤戶亦　此而稍稍吐售、其次爲上海　　　貴中下層階級、不易居住、因維持困難而遷回故鄕者　多、</p>
<p>產地跌價</p>
<p>每日全市民食、較以前須打八折、甚至於十折、有此雙重原因、嗣後米價之看跌、當在意料中、且洋米產區之西貢、因產量豐富、價格下降、木市洋米定價亦劃小、昨日米市每石價格、平均的統跌一元左右、</p>

<p>英　　大使館新任武官白克赫德七校、於前日午後、應英皇家航空協會星期宴會之的、參加該會之餐叙、皇家航空會以白上校蒞任後、並未聯歡、爰於七日設宴洗塵、並示歡迎、白上校於一九一三年中英來華、世界犬戰爆發、返國參戰、一九二八年來華北天津、後調北平、一九三四年被調赴新加坡與香港服務、最近始調仟斯職、</p>
<h3>中美新借款成立後　法幣益形穩定　日方雖極端表示不滿　但對美國又未敢開罪</h3>
<p>中美二千萬元信用借款成立消息傳出後、昨日本埠金融市塲、愈趨穩定、據某外商銀行鉅子談、此項信用放款、係指定數額範圍、由中國動用、在美國購買載重汽車及鐵路材料、並非貨予現款、故市塲上不致發生任何波　、然就其積極援助中國而論、則其意義甚屬重大、至中國法幣在外匯市塲上、三日來頗爲穩定、即有上落、亦衹有些微之變動而已、美匯昨日買進十四元五角四分、賣出十四元九角五分、英匯買進每磅五十六元四角七分、賣出五十八兀一角八分、</p>
<p>日雖悵惘亦無如何</p>
<p>字林報云、日方昨日（八日）招待新聞記者席上、或以美政府貸款予中國、對於中日局勢將有何種影響叩諸日大使館發言人者、據答稱、中國境內今有大規模戰事在進行中、</p>
<p>給予重慶</p>
<p>之經濟上或精神上的援助、皆不能認爲係對日友好之行動、但美國所給予援助之範圍、對於援助重慶政府將有何種具體結果、則不無可疑、再、此項借款、已經聲明非擬購買軍器與軍火者、故重慶對此借款用途頗小、美國民衆、似有以</p>
<p>同樣目光</p>
<p>而視中國與芬蘭之趨勢、乃誤解事實所致、或以借款將否激動在華日人與美人間之情緒相叩者、發言人答稱、渠不能想像貸款之舉、將對美日兩國民衆間之關係、發生良好影響、日政府圓滿結束在華戰事與重行調整</p>
<p>美日邦交</p>
<p>之決心、甚爲堅決、渠信日後終將顯示日本民衆與政府之誠摯、注視遠東大局者、已知日方決心云、或問、一九一一年美日商的旣吿廢止、今又貸款予中國、將吾在華促成自動的</p>
<p>反美情緒</p>
<p>、發言人答稱、目下難以相像此種情緒之將爆發、但日後之變化與情勢、將促成何種事件、則渠不能預料、各國政府之行動、皆受與情所支配、日本亦然、將來日人之對美情感、或將被他日發生之事件所激怒、但日當局不欲美日開係惡化自不待言、</p>
<h3>打撈景昇沉輪　起出屍體</h3>
<p>寗波駁輪景昇號沉沒後、迄已九日、該善後委員會曾一度打撈、因船身過重、無法起出、昨據新聲社記者問謀福輪船務部探悉、由滬屋往之汗水夫十名、於前日上午抵達寗波後，即於午後一時開始打撈、經潛水夫勘察後、因船內尙有屍體、分量過重、一時不易起出水面、故決定先行打撈船內屍體、當即撈獲女屍體三具、及男女小孩各一名、嗣因潮水過激、打撈不易、至午後三時停止、迨至晚八時潮退時、繼續潛入水底打撈、直至十時半始止、當時叉撈獲屍體一具、昨晨八時、第三次進行打撈、預定將船內屍體完全起出後、再設法將沉輪出水、惟該處潮流湍急、必須待潮退時入水打撈、不能連續工作、故非短期內所能竣事、奪波旅滬同鄉會對於此决被難旅客、頗爲關念、除已由甬災捐款項下撥滙一萬元外、昨復分別通知旅滬同鄉、勸募景昇輪捐款、爲被難旅客辦理善後之用、據又一消息、打撈沉輪、尙非困難、惟須設法入水、將沉輪四週封閉、抽出輪內之水、然後始能浮起、惟是項打撈沉輪、必需器具、尙未完備、不克進行、</p>

<h3>被日艦砲擊之英輪　湖南號已駛滬　英當局謂日方已經道歉　惟滬人曾引起極大焦慮</h3>
<p>大陸報云、上月曾遭砲艦砲擊之太古公司湖南號輪、昨日（八日）抵滬、船長白羅斯、已將被擊事之詳情、報吿本市英大使館辦公處與太古公司、據此間　當局聲稱、此事已吿結束、因日方官員曾在此事地點道歉、並允諾賠價損壞之時間也、故外交界不致續行交涉、</p>
<p>甲板後部有小凹良</p>
<p>湖南號輪損壞甚微、僅後部甲板上有小凹良一處、表示該處係落彈地點、實心鋼質砲彈一枚、已在甲板上檢得、而交英大使館官員、</p>
<p>一度引起莫大焦慮</p>
<p>該輪船員抵滬時、聞此事曾使上　人士激動、頗爲驚詫、聞該船員與旅客之眷屬、聆讀倫敦廣播與在本市報紙所　該輪被擊之簡訊後、曾紛赴太古公司辦公處、叩探該輪狀况、當時太古公司所能發表之消息、僅「船上諸人均安」而已、</p>
<p>船員之妻誤爲沉沒</p>
<p>惟某船員之妻認此言有弦外之音、且謂該輪或已沉沒而船上諸人被迫乘艇逃生、昨據本市許多人士之意、灸當局對此事件、苟發表更詳盡之消息、則不致發生謠諑與猜測、而船昌與旅客之眷屬、亦可不必憂慮、故保守秘密、似屬不當、</p>
<p>中彈之後日即道歉</p>
<p>查此事係、一月廿七日上午約十一時發生於烟台外、湖南號對日艦所發第一次警吿汽笛、未加注意、因認日艦乃攔阻他船也、但旋即停輪、而向日艦詳細報吿其船名與國籍、數分鐘、兩船前駛時、湖南號甲板上忽中一彈、據太古公司方面消息、湖南號被擊後、即有日官員離艦乘艇駛近、親自道歉、</p>
<p>旅客數人險被擊中</p>
<p>惟據該輪船員昨吿記者稱、湖南號中彈後、賡續前駛、日艦立即報吿日當局、而由日當局直接向此間英大使館官員道歉、並未通知湖南號輪、該輪甫離天津、並未將此事報吿津市英當局云、聞日艦所發、係有時用於高射砲之砲彈、墜於湖南號輪甲板、並未洞穿、衆意該彈乃日海軍某下級官佐所發、時該輪載客的二百人、內有歐人四名、彈落時、甲板上有旅客數人、險遭擊中、</p>

<h3>植樹節的由來</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>一年一度的植樹節，又很快的將到眼前了。小朋友們，知道「植樹節」的來歷嗎？知道的最好，不知道的，讀讀我這篇文字就知道了。</p>
<p>民國四年的時候，北京政府農商部，規定廢曆的清明日爲「植樹節」，上至省吏，下至縣長，必於這天率領僚屬到郊外去植梧桐，楊柳，或松，柏等樹苗，以爲「樹人樹木」之意，而全國其他各機關及各學校各團體，也擇定圜圃等地，種植樹木，以求綠葉成蔭。民國十七年，國民政府正式成立於南京，改以三月十二日，國民黨總理孫中山先生的逝世紀念日，爲「植樹節」，一方面舉行植樹典禮，一方面也所以追念締造民國的元勳，以鼓勵後代子孫的仿效孫中山先生的艱苦奮鬥的「大無畏」精神。</p>
<p>小朋友們！現在父，兄的血汗在培植你，國家的民族教育在薰陶你，你應該要格外苦讀書，格外用功。在國難的洪爐中，鍛煉出堅強的體魄，優秀的才幹，勇敢的精神，等待抗戰建國的大業完成，正需要你們來肩負起繼往開來的光榮合命，這是筆者所熱烈希望的啊！</p>
<h3>孫中山先生幼年的軼事</h3>
<p>— 鏞</p>
<p>後火（三月十二日）又是我們的國父孫中山先生的逝世紀念日了，學校中照例是放假一天。各位小朋友，校中放假是不是爲了多給你們一些游戲的機會？不，這是叫你們來追憶先生生前所做一切的偉業，而在你們的學業上，行動上作爲前輩的指針。在後面，讓筆者來舉一件關於先生幼年時的軼事，亦可以供各位在腦中多留下些深刻的景象吧。</p>
<p>有一天：中山先生閒着無事，忽然想起了一個問題：「人死後，他的一生是完了嗎？」，他就把這個問題問他的媽媽。他的媽媽說：「當然是完了。」，可是中山先生說：「如果他能够在生前做下一些轟轟烈烈的事業，那么他雖死，難道一切亦都完了嗎？」</p>
<p>中山先某次跟了他的哥哥到火奴魯魯去，途經澳門，當時的澳門與今日孤島的情形是完全相同的，到處都是令人歧途之處，什麼賭塲，什麼烟窟，多似雨後春筍，爲了這個緣故，他勸他的哥哥不是登陸。</p>
<p>中山先生在幼年時代已立下了這樣的志向，所以，日後的能成一代偉人，爲人景仰，眞可以說是一種預成的收穫。</p>
<h3>潛望鏡</h3>
<p>— 金箴</p>
<p>歐洲之戰幕揭開了已將屆半年了。海洋面上的海戰也異常的猛烈，交戰國的雙方競爭地把「潛艇擊沉軍艦」「驅逐艦追襲潛艇」……一類的消息，在報紙上極力宣傳着他們的捷報。</p>
<p>「哥哥，潛水艇是潛伏在水中，它怎能把別人的軍艦擊沉呢？」阿慧看見這種消息，而對於潛水艇的內容却一些也不知道，便這樣的去問阿明。</p>
<p>「潛水艇雖是在水中行動的，但它對於水面上一切的事物都清清楚楚的知道，那就是靠它那露出在水面的潛望鏡，所以潛望鏡是潛水艇的眼睛，如沒有了它，便如人瞎了眼的一樣無用了。從潛望著鏡望著得他人的軍艦之後，再根據數學上原理來測求。那軍艦和本身的距離，角度，軍艦的速度，噸數（就是那艦的大小）　等，很精密的計算，然後很迅速地瞄準那軍艦，把適當大小的魚雷——水中的炸彈放射過去，到得那水雷撞擊到軍艦的锏板上，便轟的一聲，擊中要害，那軍艦便慢慢地沉沒了。」阿明把潛艇炸沉軍艦的情形，講了一個大槪。</p>
<p>阿慧更尋根究底的問道：「那麼潛望鏡是怎樣構成的？」</p>
<p>「潛望鏡的構造完全根據光學上光的透射和反射原理，製造一隻潛望鏡祇需五塊玻璃——三塊凸透鏡，更遇到三稜鏡即被曲折反射，再過二過透境，又從三稜鏡的反射，便可射入人的眼睛中，所看見的物像和原來的一模一樣，如果這潛望鏡的長度愈長，也就是光綫所過的途徑越長，則我們所看見的東西也越小，所以采用的玻璃須十分的準確，否則便有糢糊的可能，潛望鏡是有一定的長度，最高是二十米（略合六十英尺），如果再比這界限長，那所看到的影像是很小，要是在陰暗的天氣，那更看不分明。潛水艇中所用的潛望鏡是更要複雜而精細，可是本質上是同樣的」。阿明更接下去說道：「今天沒有事，我們自己來做一隻簡單的潛望鏡」。阿慧當然是非常的高興。</p>
<p>阿明去找了二塊鏡子上的方片和一張馬糞紙。先把馬糞紙摺成方形，兩端更剪成了長彎形，在兩對角上很費力的裝上了兩片鏡子，但所要留意與紙盒所成的角度，要使這片鏡子反射出來的光，必須在另一片上，而別一片更從缺口那裏可以反射在人們眼上，否則是無效的。不到一個鐘點，那潛望鏡也告成了，玩的時候，只要在上端缺口附近放了一樣東西，那在下端的缺口可以望見和那東西同樣的影像。「這玩具眞好玩！」在阿慧的家裏的每一個人的口中是這樣的說着。而阿慧對於潛望鏡的原理也澈底的了解了。</p>

<h3>亞美利加洲如何得名</h3>
<p>— 曹靈佑</p>
<p>小朋友們！當你們讀到世界地理的時候，你一定知道五大洲中有亞美利加洲。亞美利加洲是西半球的大洲，西界太平洋，東界大西洋，兩端尖狹，中央係一地峽，由此分爲南北美洲。但是我想你們的地理教科書中，很少告訴你們這亞美利加洲如何得名，讓我在這裏來告訴你吧！</p>
<p>遠在一四五一年，西班牙有一位名亞美利哥，范斯浦奇誕生，年長後他爲牛肉商人，後來轉做航海事業，在數次航海後，接受了葡萄牙王的任命，去遠征現在的巴西國。他於一五〇一年五月間出發，在狂暴大洋中航行三月之久，才看到了巴西的海岸。後來可怕的颶風又將他們送到杳無人烟的南喬治亞島上，該島在南美洲南端好倫角之東數百里，是當時的人們所到的極南地方。從這裏，漂流的浮冰又將他們送回去，於一九〇二年九月他們又回到葡京里斯文本。</p>
<p>亞美利哥是一位有著作天才的人，他把他旅途的經過，寫成小册子，力言他們經過的地方，確是一塊新大陸。他寫得娓娓動聽，於是引起了許多人的注意，譯成多種文字。這些本子傳到德國，適其時，有從頭再來年青的學者，正要出版一部新地理書，他在書中述亞美利歌的發見，並建議稱其地爲亞美利加—意即亞美利哥之地，以紀念其發見者。這個建議，無人反對，不過，最初是僅指巴西一帶地方，但到後來，由於普遍的應用，「亞美利加」一詞竟變成了南美洲和北美洲全部的名稱。</p>
<h3>總理語録</h3>

<p>我們立志要做大事，不要做大官。</p>
<p>造就高深學問的方法，不但是每日講堂之內，要學先生所教的學問，還要舉一隅問反三隅，自己去推廣，在講堂之外，更須注重自修的工夫。（錄自馬眉伯著中山故事）</p>
<h3>黑兄弟（九）</h3>
<p>— 一木</p>
<p>當下他又繼續說道：「誰能爬上那黃金江發源的山頭去，在它的源頭上倒下三滴聖水，那麼爲了他，單單爲了他的分上，這條江眞的會變成一條黃金的江。不過第一次就不能失敗，一失敗之後，第二次不會成功了。要是有人把不聖潔的水倒在江中，如此那水會得把他的身體浸沒，而立即使他變成一塊黑石。」那黃金江的王說完了這話，便轉過身去，大模大樣地走到爐子的烈火中間；他的身子變了紅，又轉了白，一會兒又亮晶晶地透明起來，終於變澈了。</p>
<p>格勒疾忙趕將過去，抬頭望着烟囱，眼送那黃金江的王蒸發而消滅了。就放聲喊道：「嘎！呀！奇啊，奇啊！我的壼我的壼！我的壼！」</p>
<p>那黃金江的王剛剛沒了踪影，希華和漢士却喝得酩酊大醉大呼小叫地闖進屋子來。他們見碟子都已化爲烏有，却不怪自己酗酒荒唐，反遷怒到格勒身上，將他一陣子痛打，足足打了一刻鐘，然後各自倒在椅中，問格勒可有什麼話說。格勒不敢怠慢，忙將黃金江的王所說的那些話複述了一遍。他們倆一句話也不相信，重又把格勒打起來，直到他們的臂膀疲乏了，方始住了手，上牀睡覺去了。</p>
<p>第二天早上，他們對於格勒的話忽又相信起來，不過他們倆誰去先試，卻成了一個難解決的問題，彼此爭執了好久，終於拔出刀來互相決鬥。決鬥廝鬧的聲響，驚動了鄰居，連忙過來解勸，可是他們倆那肯聽從，還是鬥個不休，鄰人們沒奈何，就去喊了警察來。</p>
<p>漢士一聽得警察上門，立刻逃開去躲了起來；但是希華却捉將官裏去，法官因他擾亂治安，判他罰金，但他這晚早就把最後的錢都喝光了，繳不出來，於是送入牢獄監禁，等他拿得出錢來時，才能釋放。</p>
<p>漢士聽得希華已收了監，快樂得什麼似的，決意產刻趕往黃金江去。怎樣才可得到聖水，那倒是一個問題。他到牧師那裏去商量，牧師因他是一個無賴，不肯給他聖水。漢士沒法可想，只得等到晚禱時候，他第一遭前去參加，假做當胸畫着十字，偷得了一杯聖水，才得意洋洋地回家去了。</p>
<p>一宿無話，清早太陽還沒有出來，漢士已起身了。他把那聖水裝在一個瓶子裏，又在籃子裏帶了兩瓶酒和一些肉，背在背上，取了一根爬山的杖，到山上去了。</p>
<p>他在出村的當兒，走過牢獄，向鐵窗中望了一下，恰見希華正在探頭張望，滿臉現着不安定的神情。漢士冷笑着問道：「哥子早安，你可有什麼信託我轉交黃金江的王媽？」希華恨極了，把牙齒嚼得格格作聲，用足了全身的氣力，猛搖那鐵窗上的鐵梗，可是一動也不動。漢士大笑了一陣，就把那籃子重又背在背上，興高彩烈的大踏步走開了。</p>
<h3>聽的藝術　（二）</h3>
<p>你曾留心聽自己良心所說的話吧？人的品格能發出聲音，道德也有聲音，要人會聽，纔能聽着。良心是主宰，人的意志怎樣，決於他良心所發的聲音。行正，行邪，走貞潔之路，或走墜落之途，他的良心，一槪明白。如有人不知自己是否行正，這在道德上說，他必定是個愚人。我們各人的良心吩咐我們說，「這是當走的路，你去走罷！」我們翻閱歷史，知道時不論古今，人不論中外，所以能成大業，都是從留心聽良心的話而來。凡大科學家，宗教家，哲學家，和政治家，都是這樣。耶穌在這裏講「聽」的道理，就是要我們修養「聽」的藝術。要我們聽良心所發的聲音。「凡有耳聽的，就應當聽」。聽哪，一個人任自己在道德上做聾子，這是如何悲慘的事！人無視覺，聽覺，甚至嗅覺，可以生存，世上許多殘廢人是這樣，但無是非的意識，是不能生存的。人能看，能聽，能覺，能嗅，能運用各種知覺，但無是非之心，寗非怪事，做邪惡事，不覺痛苦，也無犯罪意識，這樣的人，只算人屍，不能算人。因爲他的心已死，俗語說「人無心即死，菜無心即黃，」他的生命，如何會有長進呢？沒有長進，當然只算死人。我們內心所發真理，光明，和尊榮的聲單，我們要留心聽，我們如對自己忠實，不自欺，就明白這是應當的。這內心，就是耶穌所說上帝降臨到我們裏面的天國。我們要用心聽，同時也得傾耳靜聽外面來的聲音。他人有所需要，困難，憂傷，我們耳聾不聽，這是很容易犯的毛病。要曉得人生在世，專顧自己，不體諒他人，這樣的人生，決無快樂可言。因爲人是社會動物，彼此有互相關係，決不能獨自生存。所以，我們留心聽良心的聲音，同時也得傾耳聽外來的聲單。使徒保羅傾聽了外面的聲音，「過大馬色來，帮助我們，」（待續）</p>

<p>「說書道中，有「蘇道」海道一之分，蘇道稱「光裕社」，海道稱「潤餘社」。三十年米，分庭抗禮，門戶之見很深！後來崛起了一個「普餘社」，男女拼擋；光潤兩社社員，當然一致反對「女子說書」，因着這一點關係，光潤兩社站在一條「男說書」的陣綫上，倒把過去積不相能的私見，無形中消滅了。這也是說書道中一段小小的滄桑，他年談書擅掌故者，不可不知也。</p>
<p>四五年前，是普餘社的全盛時期，近年來則已由絢爛而返於平淡！失敗的原因有好幾點：第一，社中人才太少；上手人才，除王燕語的珍珠塔，沈麗斌的雙珠鳳外，幾無可聽之書。第二，主持社務，不得其法；往往有了好的塲子，不能認眞幹去，過去的「中南」「大中」兩地盤，就是在這樣情形下失去的。第三，社員人數太少，不敷支配，難謀發展，實力不敵光潤兩社；够得十稱「響擋」的允少，聽來聽去，老是這幾擋書，不免令人厭倦！其他原因尙多，不勝枚舉，假使長此以往，不知振作，那未在艱苦奮鬥下成立起來的普餘社，終於還是要淘汰的！談普餘羣娃者，必先數醉疑仙與沈玉英，其决則周雪豓也是差强人意的一個，可是這三人都已退藏於密，不再輕以色相示人了！</p>
<p>醉疑仙本氏金，書藝傳自乃兄霓裳。某君詩「盡道阿兄傳授妙，金家小妹最知名」即本此。長得骨肉停勻，儀態端麗。五年前，甫昭豓名於三吳書壇，辮花招展，望之如畫中美人。與乃兄拼擋說「雙珠鳳」，說表利落，彈唱婉轉，非徒以飾貌之妍動人而已。平心而論，醉疑仙美則美矣，若論「媚」態，則尙不如沈家玉英。沈玉英貌非絕豓，而自有一種逗人愛憐之態。嬰寗一笑，百媚橫生，琵琶玲瓏，一時無兩！隨阿父麗斌說雙珠鳳，十二三年前即以「童女彈詞」出演於大世界，名噪一時。說表不如醉疑仙，彈唱則有過之焉，琵琶遮面，媚笑傾城，婉轉低唱時，不知風魔了台下幾許聽衆！今則名花有主此調不彈久矣</p>
<p>周雪豓係周潤泉之親女，說「文武香球」，歌喉沙啞而能不失其「糯」，色藝稍遜於醉沈；口齒聰明，說唱均有獨到處，橫波一笑，亦自風華車絕！大概是說慣了「私訂終身後花園」的故事，因此一屆及笄之年，便耐不住春花秋月！失踪以來，瞬逾兩年，聽說去年已經尋獲，但已不預備冉作出山泉水了。普餘社本年就感到人才缺乏，一自三姝退隱，遂使書擅羣芳，更有畸零冷落之感</p>
<h3>胡蝶减瘦法</h3>
<p>— 海星</p>
<p>最近公映的一絕代佳人」里，觀衆都看到胡蝶瘦了，她怎樣瘦的呢？據日前由港返滬的王引說：「胡蝶爲了求瘦，一面吃藥，一面更不吃絲毫含有脂肪的東西，連飯也只吃一小酒盅一頓，雖然肚皮餓得難過，可是她總忍受下去。」（萍按）讀者之中，一定有好多覺得太肥的人，若要减肥，不妨如法泡製一下。但减肥法很多，讀者如有更好的方法，寄交本刋，當樂予發表。同時還有許多瘦子，無時不想求肥，使自己的肌肉漸漸發達，這增肥的方法，也希望大家公開出來。</p>
<h3>論由滬去平出演之三個坤伶鬚生</h3>
<p>— 陳琳</p>
<p>北方坤伶鬚生，早年期多優秀人才，如恩曉峯小蘭英　，唱做之佳，殊不讓於一般名伶也。最近數年，坤角之在北方，唯多旦角一行，鬚生人才，自孟小冬後，未見雋品。去歲海上坤票李英秀，與師陳秀華北上，繼之向在小型劇塲出演之仇樂弟，亦隨乃父仇月祥去平。今春迫踪而去者，更有張文娟，此三人且已次第在平出演，缺乏坤伶鬚生已久之北國樂園，頓呈熱鬧。</p>
<p>仇樂弟</p>
<p>在此三人中。學戲有悠久歴史，資格最老。乃父月祥，爲孟小冬之開家師。樂弟因係梨園世家，自有不少地方比李張佔便宜，如「字眼」「武工」方面，實較餘子佳妙也，樂弟之嗓奇佳，調門能吃「乙」字調，惜略具雌音，自難與孟小冬之「雲摭月」嗓子相較，但其他大體不差。樂弟去平後，已易名「孟又冬」，先李張而出演於慶樂園，伊因與孟小冬爲姊妹行，出演之初，小冬曾爲樂弟四處拉攏，樂弟因有一條嗓子，故演出成績頗佳云</p>
<p>李英秀</p>
<p>雖係票友下海，但乃師陳秀華，劇學淵源，非一般人所能及。英秀從秀華學藝，得其眞傳，今已易名「李紹華」在平出演矣。李之嗓亦佳，不亞於樂弟，雖係半路出家，悉心研究，頗見努力。惟體格發胖，扮相吃虧不少，身段亦因之而欠瀟洒，第以李之境况優於儕單，組班出演，廣羅名角，所以別具流召力。</p>
<p>張文娟</p>
<p>來平較遲，最近始將班紙織就緒，日內即將出演，論文娟之藝，實不及前述二人，惟文娟之嗓，音寬而闊，極少雌音，乃餘子所不及。文娟身村矮小，殊不能投北方人所好，設若出演，其成績恐不及仇李輩。第文娟年事甚輕，且極聰敏，將來之發展，正未可限量。文娟今已投張榮奎門牆，榮奎之靠把戲，有獨到處，必能傳之文娟，文娟更嘗請益於楊寶忠，今旣去平，或能由榮奎寶忠敎導之也。</p>

<h3>紀世界電影藝術科學院</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>美國世界電影藝術科學研究院是全美最高的研究電影藝術的機關，這機關的所在地也就在好萊塢。他們照例一年一度，要發表過去一年中好萊塢各部門的電影工作人員的得獎名單。這名單的公佈，照往年是在二月底。新年一開始，研究院內所有的工作人員，爲了要評選得獎的影人，工作就特別緊張起來。他們對於各部門得獎人的評選。聘有專家負責，不但每一個都審愼處理，而且都能採取公正的態度，再也不存半點私心的。這評選的工作，事前嚴守秘密，不會把消息洩露，直要到名單公佈之後，才證實了誰是榜上有名。</p>
<p>在影人方面，大家以爲獲得電影藝術科學研究院的褒獎是莫大的榮譽，所以在名單沒有發表之前，一般自認爲得獎有望的影人，大家伸長了頭頸，期待名單的早日公佈。至於好萊塢電影圈外的人，事前對於獲獎的影人，照例要作種種的預測，好像博戲樣的，你猜那一個得獎，我猜那一個得獎，甚至有人還在賭東呢！離發表名單的日期愈近，空氣愈是緊張，所以近來關於影人的得獎問題，又成了好萊塢人們的目光所集中的一件事情了。</p>

<h3>從戀愛到家庭　妻權增大是小家庭的特色　戀愛成功並非事業的成功</h3>
<p>— 華生</p>
<p>道里家庭就是家族因爲普通往往叫家族爲家庭。大家都知道，我國過去的家庭制度是大家庭制度，是聚族而居的。後來才有小家庭出現。這特別見於都市裏，以一夫一妻爲主體，不像大家庭的以一個男的或女的長輩把攙經濟權，管理一切事務了。</p>
<p>小家庭跟着一部分的工業的發展而出現以後，許多人都起來擁護小家庭，說小家庭好，大家庭不好。特別是女人，堅決的這樣主張着。理由很簡單，媳婦在大家庭裏，上有公婆，旁有妯娌和姑娘，大家壓迫，傾軋起來是不容易做人的。小家庭簡單得多了，即使有公婆，也不再佔權了。女人（妻）旣有了「經濟權」，又比大家庭裏自由，他自然要贊成小家庭，那里會再夫贊成人家庭呢？這是很有理由的。</p>
<p>男人也贊成小家庭，不喜歡大家庭。因爲小家庭裏的男子，比在大家庭裏的自由些，也好像比較的獨立些。對於兒女的所有權雖比較的减少些，對於女人（妻）的所有權却要增大些，—在大家庭裏，娶來的女人雖然也是他的妻，但重要的却是公婆的媳婦，可以致不是屬於他個人，主要是屬於家庭的。一到了小家庭裏，彷彿是完全屬於他的了。</p>
<p>到這時期，戀愛說也起來了，而月覺得重要了，覺得在小家庭裏戀愛結婚是最合理想的辦法了在這時候，婚姻常事人和父母曾爭奪主權，相當猛烈。兩方面都拿出理論。現在單講婚姻當事的方面，主要的理由是：戀愛結婚，即性情相投的夫婦，對於個人的　　即事業的成就的是如何上何的　要。據說：如果夫妻能够眞正合作，各種事業就容易成功，就容易成就大事業，如果合　　，是甚麼事情也做不成功的。此外自然還有別的理由。</p>
<p>在小家庭裏，夫妻性情的相合，的確比在大家庭裏重要了。在大家庭裏，爭吵起來還可以吿訴婆婆，排解的旁人也很多；小家庭裏爭吵起來時，勸解，禁止的人旣少了，最好自然還是不爭吵，性情的投契，遂愈加覺得重要了。至於對於事業的關係，關係當然是有，多得一個人帮助和少一個人帮助，相差當然小少。但是若說　業的成敗繋於有好伴侶，這實在是不確的，若說主要由於此，也是有些誇大。事業無論大小，成功和失敗無疑的是極複雜的社會關係的總結果，很多事情還一直關係到國際。共同做道事業的人則都是，功的一分子，便是破壞的或反對的也包括在裏面，配偶的帮助不過共中的一部罷了普通社會上人士把它過大的估計，大部分原因是在用以反對舊式婚姻，主張小家庭制度，特別把自主的婚姻說得特別好。一部分原因我以爲是從美國輸入的電影上看來的。——讀者看了這話，不要以爲我反對個人自主的婚姻，我毫不反對，而且贊成的；以上的話，不過還它一個本來的面目，和藉此說明無論甚麼事情的成敗，並不是兩人的事情，而是社會以至國際關係的結果—自然這也並不是說個人的努力因此可不要了</p>

<h3>上海婚姻問題種種</h3>
<p>— 勞珊</p>
<p>據某周報廣吿上登載，在八仙橋靑年會食堂裏，一九三六年結婚决數共九八次，到了一九三八年增至一八六次，幾乎增加一倍。這個廣吿不是示該食堂喜星高照，而是反映亂世多結婚。這日不提，先來估計一下上海在去年一年中消耗的結婚筵席等費，假定全年共有十萬對結婚，每對結婚用度聘金嫁裝不計，只以筵席及酬勞等費而論，男女兩家各用一千元，那末十萬對新夫婦就是二萬萬元。即使打一個對折，也得一萬萬元。這個數目不算少吧！</p>
<p>在亂世做父母的，以爲把兒女結了婚，就可以了却心願但是一根情絲有時也不能繫住一對男女，可以安處孤島反而催促兒女們失蹤。我們不是常常在報上看到招尋失蹤兒女的廣吿嗎？大都有：「婚姻問題，汝母是不固執成見……」等言，「一夜夫妻百夜恩情」的紙　老虎，早早被無愛情的結婚　「罪惡」的利劍戳破了。捉住一對生氣勃勃的靑年，强迫他和她結婚，强迫他們困守亭子間，（上海無家園，新夫婦也只好在亭子朋裏委曲委曲）這好比中國以前的富家翁，教兒子吸鴉片，使他精神不振，不致出去嫖賭，同樣危險。世間上固然很多好心可得好報的例子，但是强迫兒女結婚的好心，只有獲得惡報，決不會有好報。</p>
<p>其次是有情的靑年男女，本來可以結婚，可以在禮節隆重費用節省的方法上結婚，但是一般愛面子的父母，非要舖張塲面，甚至非要聘金若干，嫁裝若干不可。這樣，靑年們只有兩條路，一條路是借債結婚，結婚以後，天天過大年夜還債。另一條路是靑年男女高飛遠走，給父母們一個人財兩空的報答。</p>
<p>上海究竟不是紐約，沒有試騐結婚的新聞；上海也不是巴黎，沒有婚姻介紹所操縱的報紙。上海畢竟是中國的都市，雖然有一九四〇年的汽車，二十八層洋樓，但是內層裏畢竟包着封建社會的氣質，同時有新的思想在發育着。上面所說的幾種婚姻現象，不是不可解說的怪現象，而是反映整個中國社會現象的一面。</p>

<h3>事非經過不知難　不滿意的婚姻產生滿意的結果</h3>
<p>— 其勛</p>
<p>我自己並不諱言，我也是受了客觀環境的引誘而反對「父母之命，媒妁之言」的一個靑年，自己旣無戀愛的對象，却又不願接受父母代配的婚姻。不過，我的反對却不澈底，在不忍拗違親心的思想下，終於半推半就的接受了「命」和「言」。</p>
<p>婚姻完成之後，這位女士與我理想中的典型女性的確距離得很速，非但個性固執，一錢如命，且裝束亦不入時，短短的頭髮，藍布短衫，黑綢短裙，白襪，黑布鞋，這種裝束在鄕間雖是一位摩登的學生派頭，但到上海之後，實難和上海社會人士融合。於是乎，衣料，絲襪，高跟鞋，不斷的買給她。可是，竟出於意料之外，非但求獲得她的好感，且還遭到許多譏諷，什麼：「有錢須知無錢日，莫到無時思有時。不能求一時的美觀，要想想永久的生活才是道理……」兩年來，產生於這種事情上的口角，哭泣，眞不知道有若干决。不過，她雖不趨尙摩，登不像朋友們的賢內助那樣善於交際，但對家事却處理得井然有條，絲毫不紊。</p>
<p>日子是一天天的過去，大時代的洗禮給孤島產生了許多畸形的塲面。日用品的價格飛漲，使薪給階級者勢將陷於斷炊的絕境。從去年八月起，我無日不處愁城，而她却無日小用種種方法寬慰我的心，並且，還把從前我按月交給她家用錢中所私目陸續儲蓄下來的錢拿出來爲證，以備將來補助生活，兩年之中竟也有三百餘元。我於欣喜之餘，回顧朋友們因娶摩登女性，只吃不做以致債台高築，我的神經是受了嚴重的刺激，我的精神，我的理智，我的行動，以及我的個性，都因而有極大的轉變！我對妻已由憎惡而轉變到敬愛！她在我心目中父和我從前心目中的典型女性易地而處的距離得很遠。常我失眠之夜，輾轉反覆於被中時，我會痛悔從前不該憎惡她，不自禁的會流淚，望着她熟睡的臉，輕吻她一下，撫摸一下她的頭髮。</p>
<p>從此，社會間關於婚姻問題，上面新舊兩種說法和目標，在我心中已變成了一個謎。僅憑我的理智是不能瞭解的，也不能權衡它　弊的輕重，只得謹以我經過的事實供訴出來給人參考。假如我堅決反對不娶她，我的生活決沒這樣安定</p>
<h3>集團結婚的起源　十月三十日是集團結婚日　中國集團結婚的效行</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>在人類的歷史上古時代是否仁有過集團結婚，因為暫時　不到參考的資料，姑且置之不論。但我們一說起集團結婚，便會職想到近年風行于各國的集團結婚，以意國為發剏。意大利自黑衣宰　　案里尼秉政而後，為使意國的人口得以迅速增加起見，對于結婚運動，鼓勵不遺餘力。更為補救貧窮者無力結婚起見，規定每年的十月三十日為集團結婚的日子，參加集團結婚的新夫婦，是用不到費什魔錢，原是　經濟的辦法。</p>
<p>以前上海市政府當局，鋻于市民結婚，每多人舖張，富者糜費無數金錢，貧者　因結婚而舉債，甚至礙于塲面而無力，也倡導集團結婚，由市長證婚，加入的結婚男女，每人祇須繳一十元的禮服費，其他就沒有什麼費用了。儀式旣隆重，費用又經濟，所以當一十四年四月一日，舉行第一屆集團結婚的時候同，加入的新夫婦，多　一百餘對。此後先則每月舉行一次，後來每隔兩月舉行一次，每次舉行，總有不少新夫婦參加的。</p>
<p>由於上海的倡行於前，各地的縣政府跟着也有主辦集團結婚的，而上海方面，一直到民國　十六年，沒有中斷過。直到「八一三」滬戰爆發，經過三個半月的戰事，市政當局跟了中國軍隊向內地撤退，結果才使集團結婚中輟了。隔得不久，上海却發現了幾個集團結婚服務社，集團結婚代辦所一類的機關，主辦集團結婚，此外各同鄕會在戰後亦主辦同鄕集團結婚。</p>

<p>婚俗誌異</p>
<h3>婚姻趣俗</h3>
<p>— 友仁</p>
<p>說到婚姻的風俗，各國都有他們的奇趣怪異的婚俗，現在讓我把瀛海最奇趣婚俗，寫在這裏，好讓諸位讀者作茶餘酒後之談：</p>
<p>結婚星期</p>
<p>在勃利脫義的地方，他們的給婚風俗，是每年均有一個「結婚星期」，在這期中，一般人民例須停工，而待婚的女子們，於節期前一個月，　備了奩具，待婚的男子們，　須回家，於是男子造訪女家，開始求婚，但女子這時必須匿　，待男子多方尋覓而後得，這種表示就是說要訓練新郎對愛情的忍耐呢。</p>
<p>騎馬求婚</p>
<p>革命前墨西哥人對於嬌妻的獲得，多是在馬上得來的，他們的風俗，凡求婚的男子，在一個明媚月亮的午夜裏，盛裝華服，口裏含着雪茄，手裏提着一個叫弦琴，乘着一匹駿馬，到情人寓所的　外，調琴作歌，以訴衷曲，使對方心動，婚事遂諧，否則這個男子般馬向後，低着頭的回家去，這就是失意的落伍者了。</p>
<p>暗中摸索</p>
<p>這地方的人民，在結婚這夕，新郎須要在黑暗的新房裏摸索找尋他的新娘，婚期的時候，新娘的臉上要戴上一個面幕，她非等到坐上了合歡床，才許她睜開眼睛來，在她去新家庭時，她在路上須將雙眼緊閉着，由兩位親戚領着她走路，一人執着她的手，另一人挾着她的頭，還有許多人提着燈籠蠟燭跟着她走，這種婚俗，眞的別具風味了。</p>
<p>母親作主</p>
<p>在巴西中部的博羅印第安人，他們婚姻的結合就有點不同了，他的求婚不是出於男子的主意，也不是出於女子，而是出於女子的母親，這種方法略有些似乎我國的招郎入舍，不過他們的意義不同，所以現在有很多學者贊成他們的方法，也有人提倡文明國去仿效牠呢，道方法就是由女子的母親，於廣庭大衆之中，訪得合意的少年，然後延請他到家裏，享以辛辣的食品，而這個少年於赴席時，亦必與自己的母親同去，倘者自己是合意於女子時，他就將食品一一嘗試，並且將餘剩的送給母親吃，如果他的母親也表示同意，亦吃少許，於是這椿婚事就成功了，說到他們的結婚儀式，也很簡單，在婚前四日，新郎到女家住宿，但祇是住宿，不能與新娘會面到第五日淸晨兩八便相見了，同時踞坐於茅舍之前，宣吿完婚，新郎四大的住居，據說就是測騐性情一下，這種簡單的婚禮，目前還有好些人是同情與提倡的。</p>
<h3>賓陽的婚姻怪俗</h3>
<p>— 糜若拙</p>
<p>賓陽——衹要每日留心看戰串新聞的人，想總不會生疎這個地名吧！</p>
<p>對於婚姻在賓陽盛行着早婚俗，普涌男十六當娶，女十四即嫁，因爲自己感到年齡太小，所以在結婚一天新郎新娘非但沒有欣快的感覺，反而到處形露着慚愧與恐懼的表情，甚至做出避廻與藏匿的把戲呢</p>
<p>結婚後第一天，新娘宿新郎家，惟第二天淸晨新娘便回到娘家去了，以後雖逢過年過節之日，新娘仍居家不離。直至數年後，男家到女家的不回來住宿不能過問，祇有聽其自然。不過當男子要決定放棄他妻子的話，他可將她作爲婢奴般的賣給他人；反之，假使她對於她丈夫有不滿意時，却只能作消極的不合作——永不回丈夫家。</p>
<p>女子初嫁，聘金每在六十元至一百元之間；但是在改嫁時，身嫁便倍增，可是改嫁時的身價收入，並非歸女家所得，而屬男家者，因爲上段說過，在男于決定放棄他妻子時，男家可將她作奴婢般的賣給他人的呀！</p>
<h3>駭人聽聞之婚姻風俗　砍人手足方許成婚</h3>
<p>— 思</p>
<p>西菲所屬的卡里奇姆亞島是一個未開化的島嶼，島上產大蜇蜴鰐魚，土人獵捕充食，探險家曾數度冒險在此荒爲探測礦苗，但均無結果。</p>
<p>最近克遜博士由西菲駕飛機到達該島探險，忽在島之直南隅　現產量豐富的銻礦。</p>
<p>據克遜博士云，當他乘飛機到達該島時，適逢雨季節開始，曾目睹若干土人在細雨之下舞蹈在歡。他們婚俗奇特，聽之令人駭異，男女互相愛悅之後，男家糾集戚友，一窩蜂似的跑到女家搶親。女家也糾集戚友實行抵禦，雙方械鬥頗爲劇烈。女家方面必須活捉男家搶親人之一，將其手或足砍下一隻，然後方准新娘任由男家綁架而去，女家便將所砍得的手或足，置於祭壇之上，聚衆舞蹈作樂，男家那位被捉砍去手足的人，終身成了殘廢，新娘和新郎，應負贍養責任。</p>
<h3>新穎的婚禮</h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>簡單而儀式新穎的婚禮，在我們的腦海中，如果不是很健忘的話，則我們約略地可以記得：許是十年以前吧？曾任因爲在島上獵捕鰐魚蜇蜴以充食糧，是一件很不容易的工作，只有讓年輕體强的人去幹，所以活捉的人多半是上了年紀，自己因體力衰弱，不能捕捉猛獸，寗願趁此機會，犧牲了一隻手或一隻足代價，來解決終身的生活。廣東航空司令的劉沛泉，曾在上海舉行過空中結婚，一對新夫婦，乘着飛機翱翔於天空，婚禮就算吿成，這眞是名副共實的在天願爲比翼鳥」啊！</p>
<p>六七年前，新穎的婚禮又出現在我們眼前了，那是徐卓呆先生的女公子徐某女士，和海上漱石生孫玉聲的公子在水上舉行婚禮，那時曾經　動了全市，報章勝載，傳爲美談。然而不久以前，「戲水鴛鴦」更撒底的是將無過於人猿泰山韋斯摩勒，和鼎鼎大名的交際花芭麗司格特女士的游泳池底作結婚的禮堂了，泰山在銀幕上雖然是一位山林裏的覇王，可是他原是一位活躍於水裏的游泳冠軍，因此他計劃着的婚禮，是要在水底舉行，於是證婚人，嬪相，便不得不跟着他倆新夫婦同下水去「滅頂」一遭。</p>
<p>但新穎的婚禮是愈出愈奇了的，自從歐戰爆發以後，在波蘭，在芬蘭，有很多的靑年男女，因爲要執戈疆塲，服務後方，在戎馬倥惚之中，便不得不迅速地完成了結婚的手續，於是防空壕裏舉行婚禮，便如雨後春筍般底流行起來。這在我國西南內地據說也已司空見慣了的。「在地願爲連理枝」，以防空壕來作結婚的禮堂，當機聲軋軋，炸聲隆隆的時候，却也別有一股滋味在心頭呢！我不知道置身於燈紅酒綠的孤島上，舉行婚禮於入飯店大禮堂之中，窮奢務闊的靑年男女們，對此新穎的婚禮，是將作何感想？</p>
<h3>爬樹結婚</h3>
<p>在菲列濱若干地方，還遺留一個有趣可愛的結婚習俗，就是當一雙情侶，互相愛好，願訂白　時，他們的父母，便在四郊找兩顆相距不十分遠的大樹，但須高低粗細人致相同，到了預定的黃道吉日，便請這一對將締夫婦的男女，同到樹下站立，命他們從樹根下爬到樹頂上，爬到後，男子便用力伸臂去將女方的樹幹櫻住，同時女的也自然極力設法，帮他的未婚夫達到這目的，當兩顆樹尖拼合一起時，站在樹下的主婚人，便很莊嚴地宣佈婚禮已經吿成了！</p>
<h3>黃金國的婚姻誡條</h3>
<p>— 尹子</p>
<p>建築在黃金基礎上的美利堅，他們靑年男女對於自己的婚姻，却並不以黃金來解決問題，他們或她們都很普遍地信守一種很平凡的誡條：</p>
<p>關於男子的</p>
<p>一，不與屢　離婚的婦人結婚，同時也不與年輕而妖艷的女子結婚。</p>
<p>二，不與浮薄的女子結婚。</p>
<p>三，不與專心於化裝而爭奇鬥艷的女子結婚。</p>
<p>四，不以女子之財產爲目的而結婚。</p>
<p>五，不娶無家政知識而徒具美貌的女子爲婦。</p>
<p>關於女子的</p>
<p>一，不與較目己年輕的靑年成婚。</p>
<p>二，不與狂飲酒在吸烟的男子結婚。</p>
<p>三，不與放蕩遊惰而無藝無職的男子成婚，但有技能的失業者是例外。</p>
<p>四，不與吝嗇的男子成婚。</p>
<p>五，不與僞君子而殘忍刻薄的男子成婚。</p>
<p>六，不因貧乏的男子而辭絕其婚姻。</p>
<h3>蘇聯的婚姻制度　最簡單，又合理</h3>
<p>— 清暉</p>
<p>在蘇聯剛剛革命的後幾年，社會秩序還不曾安定，在男女的關係上，放縱，濫交，混亂的情形是不免有的。然而現在，這種變態的樣子已經是過去的名詞了。他們底戀愛比之我們「禮義之邦」還要嚴肅而正經得多！國家法律規定，男女到了十八歲就得自由結婚了。結婚的手續眞是節單極了，祇要男女倆到國家行政機關的結婚登記所去，付點極小的手續費，登記一下，出來就成爲正式的夫婦了。</p>
<p>蘇聯每個男子一結了婚，並不是說，從此要加上可怕的家庭負擔，或者在女的一方面，就必須受丈夫的束縛。不！絕對不！在蘇聯，沒有一個丈夫能束縛妻子，也沒有一個妻子要靠丈夫撫養，雙方在社會上，經濟上，都是完全獨立的</p>
<p>至於離婚呢？非經雙方同意且有相當的理由，是不許可的，離婚的手續，也是舉行一次登記。</p>
<p>離了婚，對於子女的扶養，仍是由雙方分擔，如果男女雙方那　面所掙的薪水高，就那一面分擔得多一點。</p>
<p>結了婚，女人如果懷了孕，那末休假就是她們的特權。在休假的時候，所供職的機關對於她們，不但照常支薪，而且還有津貼。生育的休假期是產前產後各兩個月？共休息四個月。生產時一切醫藥療養用途，都是國家免費供給的。</p>

<h3>Chen Shaoyu on Democratic Politics</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Wang Ming, also known as Chen Shaoyu, a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, published an article in the Chinese Communist Party's newspaper Xinhua Daily today, discussing democratic politics. He said that merely convening the National Assembly to formulate a constitution cannot be considered the implementation of constitutional government or democratic politics. He also said that true democratic politics has two essential conditions: first, the people must have freedom, including freedom of publication, speech, assembly, association, belief, and thought; second, all legitimate activities, political parties, and groups that support democratic politics have the right to exist legally; third, there must be people's congresses automatically elected by the people in all parts of the country. If these three things do not exist in reality, then no matter how beautifully it is said, it is self-deception. Therefore, the constitutional government that the Chinese people are currently striving to achieve and demand is a National Assembly that truly represents the people, a constitution that truly represents the will of the people and protects the rights and interests of the people, and a constitutional government that can truly implement democratic politics.

This shows the severity of the situation. The people are suffering unspeakably. (Telegram of the 9th)</p>
<h3>One Week of Battle Situation: March 2nd to 8th</h3>
<p>Chongqing: A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated that the Chinese army on all fronts has continued to inflict damage on the stubborn Japanese in the past week. The war is progressing extremely smoothly. The Japanese are overwhelmed and struggling. The frequent anti-war riots in their country and the declining morale of the front lines are becoming increasingly intense. Their foolish attempts to struggle desperately will be gradually crushed by the Chinese. Regarding the course of the battle, the more important aspects are approximately as follows:</p>
<p>Southern Guangxi</p>
<p>The Chinese army was originally in a standoff with the Japanese near Canshibu, Gaofeng'ao, and Santang on the outskirts of Nanning. On the 6th, the Chinese army rose up to attack the Japanese, advancing on Santang and driving the remaining Japanese to the vicinity of Ertang. The Japanese were extremely panicked and automatically destroyed the public works south of Santang and Gaofeng'ao. South of the Yu River, the Chinese party defeated the Japanese who attacked Shangsi and took advantage of the victory to advance, successively capturing Liangqing and other places, giving the Japanese a relentless pursuit and annihilation, and seizing huge gains.</p>
<p>Guangdong Area</p>
<p>On the morning of the 4th, the Japanese troops on the southern route launched a large-scale attack on the Chinese army on Hainan Island in four directions. After being met with mobile counterattacks, they were severely damaged near Wenyacun, north of Xincun, and in various areas in the near suburbs of Dan County. The Japanese offensive was greatly frustrated, and the remaining Japanese troops are hesitating and faltering in the high mountains, having fallen into a dilemma of advancing or retreating. At this moment, their return route has been cut off. Japanese troops who attacked Zhongshan landed and attacked at Tangjiawan (east of Zhongshan County) and Xiangzhou (south of Tangjiawan) on the morning of the 5th, covered by many Japanese aircraft. After the Chinese separately surrounded and fiercely attacked them, the Japanese suffered extremely heavy casualties. At this moment, they are still being annihilated. At the same time, strongholds such as Guanyao, Xinjie, and the southwest of Sanshui in northwestern Guangzhou were repeatedly stormed by the Chinese army. The Chinese army also broke into Zengcheng in eastern Guangdong and defeated the Japanese who attacked Chenghai. The Japanese army, trapped in Guangzhou, is threatened by the Chinese on all sides. Military morale is wavering, and anti-war incidents are occurring one after another, leading to a state of self-destruction.</p>
<p>Hubei Province</p>
<p>In the past week, the Chinese army has been engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese army at the foot of the Dahong, Tongbai, and Dabie Mountains, achieving successive victories. One route crossed the Xiang River to the east and advanced towards Zhongxiang, Jingshan, and Tianmen counties. On the 4th, a unit stormed into Tianmen, with the vanguard reaching the suburbs of each county, completely controlling the Hanyi Road. Another route defeated the Japanese who attacked Mopan Mountain from Luotuo Town in southern Henan and recovered the strongholds of Hejiadian and Xinqiao south of Suixian, attacking the South Gate and killing countless Japanese soldiers. At this moment, the important areas surrounding the county seat are under the control of the Chinese army. Another route defeated the Japanese army that attacked Baliwan, taking advantage of the victory to launch a fierce attack on Macheng, burning down a Japanese barracks and driving all the Japanese out of the suburbs. The Japanese, who had been foolishly attempting to move towards the Dahong, Tongbai, and Dabie Mountains, were unable to do so.</p>
<p>Jiangsu and Anhui</p>
<p>After Lanxi and Liyang in the south were recovered by the Chinese army, they continued to advance in recent days, giving the defeated Japanese a fierce pursuit with rapid progress. The Chinese army in southern Jiangsu successively captured Litouqiao and Shanghebu, and the Japanese retreated to Tianwangtang. Another unit captured Dongliuzhen, and the Japanese retreated to Hongbu. On the Anhui side, the Chinese army captured Xinhezhuang, and the Japanese army retreated towards Wanzhi. Another unit of the Chinese army took advantage of the situation to attack Datong, killing many Japanese soldiers. Soon, over two thousand Japanese soldiers from Wan and Che launched a counterattack towards the Xinhezhuang area. After the Chinese launched a multi-pronged attack, six to seven hundred Japanese soldiers were killed, and the Japanese fled immediately. Over a thousand Japanese soldiers from Mingguang in northern Anhui had attacked Dingyuan, and the Chinese bravely fought back. As of the evening of the 4th, they were still fighting. As for the Japanese warships that had entered Anhui, they were bombarded by the Chinese army on the river surface in the Dongliu and Anqing areas in recent days, and over ten ships were sunk, killing over a thousand Japanese soldiers. Japanese water transportation cannot be restored.</p>
<p>Southern Shanxi</p>
<p>The war has gradually intensified in the past week. The Chinese army in southeastern Shanxi once stormed into Changzi, engaging in street fighting with the Japanese and killing a large number of Japanese soldiers. The Japanese in various strongholds west of the Fen River in western Shanxi were repeatedly attacked by the Chinese army and retreated successively. At this moment, Heilongguan, Linfen, Hongdong, Zhao City, Hejin, and Xinjiang are still under Chinese siege. Quanzhang, an important point northwest of Xinjiang, has already been recovered. The Japanese who attacked Puxian were defeated by the Chinese army, and at this moment, there are no traces of the Japanese near Puxian.</p>
<p>Henan Province</p>
<p>The Chinese army also repeatedly frustrated the stubborn Japanese in Bo'ai, Zhongmu, and Xinyang, and once stormed into Zhongmu, killing many Japanese soldiers.</p>
<p>Western Suiyuan</p>
<p>The Chinese army continued to besiege Wuyuan and destroyed over ten Japanese vehicles that had been reinforced by Guyang to Baotou. There were fierce battles in Xincheng, Gu'an, Yongqing, and Wuqing on both sides of the Pingjin Road, killing over a thousand people. The Japanese in Pingjin were extremely shaken.</p>
<p>Shandong Province</p>
<p>The Chinese have been fiercely attacking the Japanese in Laiwu, Linqu, Pingtai, Taian, and Feixian, achieving successive triumphs. Japanese traffic on the Jinpu and Jiaoji railways has been cut off from time to time.</p>
<p>Northern Hunan</p>
<p>The Chinese stormed into the Japanese camp in Yanglousi.</p>
<p>Jiangnan</p>
<p>The Chinese are eliminating the remaining Japanese soldiers on Chongming Island. These are all important war updates in the past week. (Telegram of the 9th)</p>

<h3>Anti-British Movement in Weihaiwei Revives Again</h3>
<p>Weihaiwei: The anti-British movement in Weihaiwei has been dormant for some time, but it has suddenly revived after the Japanese launched a campaign to cleanse the guerrillas in the Jiaodong area. The so-called Jiaodong area includes the entire eastern part of the Shandong Peninsula. Slogans and colorful paper banners against Britain and illustrations depicting the extraction of fat from India and China are now found everywhere in Weihaiwei. One slogan reads: "Those who hope for early peace, national liberation, and Asian prosperity should immediately rise up and overthrow Britain." Another slogan reads: "Britain is the common enemy of the Asian people. To promote the prosperity of East Asia and the new China, Britain must be dealt with first." (Reuters telegram of the 9th)</p>
<h3>Chongqing Municipal Government Suppresses and Stabilizes Prices</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The municipal authorities here have recently been actively engaged in two measures: one is the control of prices, and the other is the evacuation of the people. Regarding the control of prices, the authorities have now adopted the strictest methods to deal with speculators. At the same time, the government has stipulated the selling prices of all daily necessities. Businesses that violate this law will be sealed off without exception. Regarding the evacuation of the population, notices have been posted all over the city, advising people to evacuate voluntarily. Otherwise, coercive measures will be taken. In order to make it easier for people to evacuate, the Chongqing municipality has closed down several cinemas. However, the reasons why people are still hesitant are, firstly, the inconvenience of transportation and, secondly, the difficulty of finding suitable accommodation.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Prospect of British and Italian Coal Interception Dispute</h3>
<p>Recently, the military situation in Europe and the West has remained relatively quiet, but the economic war is showing signs of increasing tension. In order to intensify the economic blockade against Germany, Britain has strictly prohibited the export of all German goods, and has therefore announced that German coal destined for Italy is also on the list of prohibited items and should be detained. As a result, several Italian coal ships sailing from Rotterdam, the Netherlands, were intercepted during British naval inspections. Since the issue arose, the Italian government has protested to the British government, arguing that this British action is in conflict with the Anglo-Italian Agreement of 1938 and has a significant impact on Italy's economic development. It also believes that current international law provides for the protection of the commercial interests of neutral countries, and that the British government's inspection and interception of Italian coal purchases violates the spirit of international law. The British government is expected to respond to this protest within days. According to yesterday's reports, the British wording is extremely mild, but its argument states that the British King's decree treats everyone equally, and that such measures were implemented during the last European war, when Italy handled it in parallel, so there is a precedent to follow. It is expected that Ribbentrop's visit to Italy at this time will inevitably have some impact on Italy's attitude towards Britain. It is very possible that this event will become a fuse, affecting Italy and the future of the European war.</p>
<p>Among the major European powers, Italy has the greatest shortage of coal, with domestic production amounting to only about 2 million tons per year. Moreover, the quality of the coal is poor and cannot be used in important industries, so it must be purchased from foreign countries. During the last European war, Italy's coal supply problem was already serious, let alone today, 25 years later, when Italy's industrialization has greatly increased, and the need and consumption of coal has naturally increased dramatically. According to recent statistics, the total amount of coal imported by Italy from foreign countries is about 12 million to 13 million tons per year. Now that the imported German coal has been detained, it certainly cannot be seen as a complete interruption of the source of coal needed by Italy, or even lead to serious difficulties in economic production and national life? But it cannot be seen as a profound stimulus to Italy.</p>
<p>Originally, Italy obtained more than half of its required coal from Germany and Austria; for example, in 1938, Italy imported 12 million tons of coal, of which 7 million tons came from Germany and Austria; in addition, 1.6 million tons were imported from Poland and 540,000 tons from Czechoslovakia. Now that Austria, Poland, and Czechoslovakia have all fallen under the direct jurisdiction of Germany, it can be said that Italy depends on Germany for about 80 percent of its needs. When the war broke out, Germany, on the one hand, faced a surge in its own needs, and on the other hand, encountered some practical transportation difficulties in transporting coal to Italy, but there were also other factors that allowed the supply and demand between Germany and Italy to be maintained with effort, without interruption. Now, in order to intensify the economic war against Germany, Britain has intercepted Italian coal ships on the high seas and conducted inspections to prevent transportation, with the intention of hitting German trade, not making things difficult for Italy. However, coal is essential for economic production and national life, especially for heavy industry, and it cannot be short or interrupted for a day. Therefore, it is possible to find other ways to replenish the supply after the detention, but the immediate impact can be regarded as extremely serious. The Italian government is currently adopting a calm and silent attitude, awaiting the British government's reply to decide on future actions. It is extremely difficult to predict how future actions will be decided, but it would not be surprising to take any action under this pretext.</p>
<p>We do not need to speculate on how Italy will act for the time being, and we may as well think in the most amicable way. Even though the sea route for coal transportation between Germany and Italy has been blocked by Britain, there is still a land transport line between Germany and Italy, so it is not impossible to transport German coal to Italy. However, examining past statistics, the railway transportation between Germany and Italy has a very small limit. It is very difficult for the two countries to increase the volume of coal transported by rail, because neither Germany nor Italy has a large number of heavy-duty freight cars that can be used to transport coal. Moreover, the Alps traverse between them, and the railway transportation line is hindered by this natural obstacle and cannot carry a large amount of coal. Historically, coal from Upper Silesia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia has been transported to Italy via sea routes in Gdynia, Stettin, or Hamburg. If we consider taking the long way around, taking the slow way instead of the fast way, taking the sea instead of the land, and doing so with all kinds of uneconomical measures, then the difficulty of transporting coal by rail can be imagined. Although the dramatic changes in the political situation in Europe over the past year have brought Germany and Italy closer together in space, if efforts are made to improve the railway equipment and efficiency of Bohemia and Austria, it is politically possible and indeed much more convenient than a year ago; in this case, the volume of land transportation between Germany and Italy should be expected to increase dramatically. However, Germany has already exhausted its resources for the war, and it is said that it is struggling to maintain all its transportation infrastructure, which shows signs of being stretched thin. Therefore, it is difficult and untimely to plan improvements and new construction in order to expand transportation to Italy, even if it is possible. From this point of view, one may come to the opposite conclusion, that Italy may prepare to improve its commercial agreement with Britain in a neutral posture, thereby obtaining the coal it needs, which is not entirely impossible.</p>
<p>During wartime, diplomatic disputes between belligerent countries and neutral countries are a very common phenomenon. It is not surprising that Britain's prevention of German coal from being exported to Italy has led to a dispute with Italy. As for the current Italy, its international policy is so-called non-participation in the war, which has a subtle difference in meaning from general neutrality. At the same time, the foundation of the German-Italian axis still exists, and Italy can make the most of its special status and opportunities, taking its own interests as the premise in everything. This certainly cannot be said to be that Italy can make the most of its trickery and do whatever it wants, because the wartime weaknesses of Britain and France and the general weaknesses of Italy are also difficult to compare and judge which is more advantageous. Moreover, the true strength of Germany and the Soviet Union has no credible estimate at all, and the military situation on the Western Front is stagnant, so it is difficult to see the outcome. Therefore, Italy urgently needs coal. Although it is not entirely impossible that the relationship with Britain will deteriorate to the point of no return due to the coal detention, it is not an inevitable trend.</p>

<h3>U.S. Secretary of State's Talk - Purpose of Loans to China - To Promote Trade Between the Two Countries - Rumor That China Is Trying to Contact the U.S. - Third Loan of 55 Million</h3>
<p>Washington - U.S. Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that the U.S. is lending China a new loan of US$20 million. The purpose of this loan is to promote U.S. foreign trade. U.S. trade policy stipulates that the Export-Import Bank, a semi-official institution, can lend to certain countries to promote trade between the two countries. When reporters asked Hull to respond to the Japanese Foreign Ministry's statement that the U.S. loan to China was an "unfriendly gesture" to Japan, Hull declined to comment further. The Export-Import Bank implemented a loan of US$20 million to China on Thursday. In December 1938, the U.S. first lent China a credit loan of US$25 million. Together with the new loan of US$20 million, the total has reached US$45 million. Recent official documents announced that China has exceeded the amount due on the amortization schedule for the first credit loan. Chinese sources here claim that the new loan will be used to purchase U.S. hardware, gasoline, trucks, road construction machinery, mining and smelting machinery, medicines, and other raw materials necessary for construction. In addition, the U.S. Committee for Aid to Chinese Civilians has raised US$500,000 to purchase medicines for shipment to China. Chen Guangfu, head of the Chinese Purchasing and Finance Mission, said that China will continue to ship tung oil, tin ore, and other raw materials necessary for U.S. industry to the U.S. through the Universal Trading Corporation, that is, the above-mentioned exports will repay the U.S. loan. The Universal Trading Corporation will also use the new loan to purchase various goods for the Chinese government. The new loan was allocated from the US$100 million increase in the capital of the Export-Import Bank approved by Congress. Congress also amended the foreign loan law, stipulating that the loan to each foreign government be reduced from US$30 million to US$20 million. Well-informed sources here claim that China is trying to borrow another US$55 million from the U.S., which, together with the first US$25 million and the current US$20 million, totals US$100 million. It is reported that the future loan will be divided into two batches, the first batch being US$25 million and the second batch being US$30 million. At that time, Congress will have to amend the foreign loan law again to allow the Export-Import Bank to lend China the required loan. (United Press dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<p>Washington - According to sources in Tokyo, the Japanese government believes that the U.S. loan of US$20 million to China is an "unfriendly action" to Japan. Regarding this matter, Secretary of State Hull declared that this loan is in accordance with the regulations for lending to foreign countries and promoting trade, and does not know why it is unfriendly to Japan. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - This morning, the Central Daily News editorial said that the establishment of a US$20 million loan between the U.S. and China on the eve of the establishment of Wang Jingwei's "new regime" is no less important than a million U.S. soldiers fighting side by side with China in China. The significance of this loan is far beyond that of ordinary international loans. The U.S. Export-Import Bank had already lent China US$25 million. According to regulations, it could no longer continue to lend. Therefore, the U.S. government specially ignored the trouble and passed a new law so that this new loan could be established. Since the expiration of the U.S.-Japan trade treaty, the U.S. has not only not extended the old treaty, but also not taken steps to negotiate a new treaty. The consistent sympathy of the U.S. President, the public, and all parties in Congress for China is evident here. This move was realized on the eve of the establishment of Wang Jingwei's "new regime" and should be a serious warning to Japan. If Japan changes its policy in China, third parties may continue to take "unfriendly and unpleasant" actions. The value of this new loan in terms of spiritual encouragement is actually greater than its material value. This kind of sympathy and friendship from the U.S. gives China greater confidence in the final victory. (Reuters dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<h3>Japan Worried and Indignant About U.S. Huge Loan to China - Discussed U.S. Armed Intervention - Tokyo Newspaper Urges Attention to Current Trends</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The "Kokumin Shimbun" here wrote today that the U.S. loan of US$20 million to China and the refusal to renew the new trade treaty with Japan have caused the U.S. to lose all rights and qualifications as a mediator in the Sino-Japanese war. The newspaper continued, saying that Japan's only response to U.S. mediation is that Japan's policy towards the U.S. will adopt the same attitude as Germany and Italy towards the U.S. As far as we know, Germany and Italy do not think it is very appropriate for the U.S. to mediate in Europe, because the U.S. has more sympathy for the democratic group. Also, newspapers here today criticized U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles' visit to Europe as a failure. The "Asahi Shimbun" pointed out that there is no possibility of mediation between the Allied countries and Germany at present. The "Kokumin Shimbun" also believes that Welles' arrival in London may discuss the Far East issue with the British government, arousing the attention of people all over the world. However, the newspaper also believes that it is difficult for the U.S. to take the position of mediator. (United Press dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The "Asahi Shimbun" published an editorial, stating briefly that the U.S. assistance to the Nationalist government has the sole purpose of defeating Japan. The U.S. government has notified Japan that it will abolish the U.S.-Japan trade treaty. Currently, the U.S. Export-Import Bank has lent China 20 million gold and continues to threaten Japan. The Japanese government has been forced to strengthen its national defense and find ways to eliminate its economic dependence on the U.S. Japan knows that when the U.S. cannot achieve its goals through economic pressure, it will resort to military intervention. The strengthening of the U.S. Navy is a clear indication. Japan should immediately recognize that as the U.S. gradually advances its East Asia policy, the U.S. attitude of hostility towards Japan is also increasing. Japan should give serious consideration to this trend in its current China policy. (Haitong dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Today's Asahi Shimbun commented on the U.S. aid to the Chinese government, saying that in the current session of the Japanese Diet, there was a serious discussion about the U.S. intention to intervene in the China incident not only on the basis of conditions and disputes, but also by relying on the power of true force. The government authorities have done everything possible to prepare for any new developments. It also said that the more actively Japan promotes its work to build a "new order," the more the U.S. will make greater efforts to obstruct the progress of this work and will more frankly express its hostile attitude towards Japan. In Japan's current China policy, serious consideration should be given to this trend. (Reuters dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<h3>Japan Claims Policy Toward East Asia Remains Unchanged - Will Dispatch Special Envoy to China - To Negotiate With "Wang Regime"</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese newspapers today carried reports stating that the Japanese government will issue a document next week explaining that Japan's policy of "building a new order in East Asia" is based on the document issued by Fumimaro Konoe on December 22, 1938. The document advocates Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, friendly relations between the two countries, and joint anti-communism. It is said that this time, the Japanese government's document will be announced by Japanese Prime Minister Mitsumasa Yonai on March 15 at the opening of the "Central Political Conference" in Nanjing. The conference will make the final plans for the construction of the new "Central Government" led by Wang Jingwei. Japanese newspapers claim that Yonai will announce at that time that Japan's invasion of China, which caused hundreds of thousands of Chinese people to lose their lives and property, is not a war of aggression. Yonai will reiterate the Japanese government's determination to support the "Wang Regime" to be established in Nanjing. The Japanese will soon select a special envoy to attend the establishment of the "Wang Regime" in Nanjing next month. The special envoy will hold negotiations with the "Jiang Regime" to try to adjust Sino-Japanese relations. The highest calls for candidates for the special envoy are former Prime Minister Hirota Koki and General Abe Nobuyuki. General Abe will go to Shanghai this month. The position of the first special envoy sent by Japan to the "Nanjing Regime" was originally intended to be filled by Fumimaro Konoe, but he refused to accept it.

<h3>Problem of Foreign Debt of Chinese Railways - Discussed in Japanese House of Representatives</h3>
<p>Tokyo - At today's meeting of the House of Representatives, questions were raised about the status of foreign loans secured by Chinese railways. Hidakazu, the Economic Minister of the Asian Court, replied that the Chinese railways are all operated by companies jointly run by China and Japan. The Japanese side invests in cash and materials, while the Chinese side invests in cash. Negotiations on foreign loans secured by the railways are a matter for the Chinese government. Japan believes that any negotiations should be handled by the Chinese government. Someone then asked whether Japan intends to return the railways after the China incident is resolved and before formal negotiations on the future status of the railways begin. Hidakazu replied that the companies managing the Chinese railways are enterprises jointly run by China and Japan. These railways are the property of the Chinese government. The Japanese government hopes to clarify the relationship between railway sovereignty and Japan's payments to the Chinese government for its railway operations, so as to avoid any concerns about Japan's position regarding railway affairs.

<h3>Japanese Army in Northern Manchuria - Hastily Building Works - To Prevent Soviet Attack</h3>
<p>Changchun - According to a report obtained here from Heihe, senior Japanese army commanders in northern "Manchukuo" are now hastily building defensive works to prevent a Soviet attack. It is said that the "Manchukuo" budget for developing the north in 1940 is 3,180,000 yuan. The first step is to rush to build highways so that the Japanese army can concentrate completely in a short period of time. It is found that the 1940 budget increased by 1,024,000 yuan compared with last year, and the total amount reached 3,181,000 yuan. Of this, 2,119,000 yuan is used for the development of transportation, and the rest is used for agricultural education and other items. (United Press dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<h3>France Takes a Tough Stance Toward Japan - "Bangkok Maru" Incident - France Decides to Reject Japanese Protest</h3>
<p>Paris - Well-informed sources here declared that if the Japanese side protests about the detention of mail on the "Bangkok Maru," the French side will refuse and reject it. Currently, the Japanese Consul General stationed in Hanoi has lodged an oral protest, but a formal protest from the Japanese Embassy here has not yet been received. At the same time, the French authorities have notified the Japanese transport company here that all mail must be inspected in the future. (United Press dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Legislator Exposes Corruption in Internal Affairs - Paid for 33 Years - Telegraph Bureau Still Doesn't Install Telephone</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese legislator Kojima gave a shocking speech in the Diet the other day. According to Kojima, "He paid the Telegraph Bureau 15 yuan 33 years ago to request the installation of a telephone. He has been waiting for 33 years, but the telephone has not yet been installed. According to statistics, 100,000 houses and shops have paid 15 yuan and submitted applications for telephone installation to the Telegraph Bureau, but the results have not obtained telephones. After the Telegraph Bureau received 1.5 million yuan, it still made no statement. If the Telegraph Bureau is a private institution, I would have sued long ago. Imagine that I paid the Telegraph Bureau 15 yuan 33 years ago. If I had deposited this money in the bank, wouldn't I have become a rich man long ago? In 1907, I was still a young man, but now I have become an old man with white hair. If the Telegraph Bureau continues this policy of delay, I will have to make a will and declare that I will leave this telephone for my children and grandchildren to enjoy."

<h3>Tokyo Newspapers Advocate Reorganization of the Diet - Aftermath of Saito Issue - Split of Japanese Socialist Party</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The case of Minseito Party member Fujio's "slip of the tongue" has been disturbing for more than a month. Finally, the House of Representatives decided to expel him. An extraordinary wave has subsided. However, the newspapers feel tired of the situation in the House of Representatives and believe that parliamentary politics has completely failed. The extreme nationalist "Kokumin Shimbun" advocates dissolving all political parties and replacing them with a powerful, all-encompassing one-party system, presided over by the military and nationalists. The "Hochi Shimbun" calls for the dissolution of bad political parties. The "Asahi Shimbun" said that in view of the current international situation, it is necessary to properly reorganize the House of Representatives. (Havas dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Social Democratic Party discussed the issue of Saito Takao's punishment. At that time, party leader Abe Kio and Suzuki Bunji, Koya Chozo, Nishio Suehiro, Okazaki Ken, Katayama Tetsu, Yonezawa Mitsuru, Matsunaga Yoshio, Tomikichi Eiji, Matsumoto Jihachiro and other ten people expressed opposition to the mainstream opinion of the party headquarters, which stimulated the young guards. When the party held a meeting of representatives on the 8th, the idle and comfortable sentiment was to advise the other nine people besides the party leader Abe to leave the party, and asked the nine people to reply within nine days. As a result of discussions today, Katayama Tetsu and the other nine people have refused the party's advice. (Daimen Alliance dispatch on the 9th)</p>

<h3>Tense Anglo-Italian Relations Strike: German Foreign Minister Suddenly Visits Rome to Exchange Important Opinions on the European Situation and Attempt to Re-Establish a Strong Axis Relationship</h3>
<p>Berlin: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop left this morning at 9:15 AM (4:15 PM Shanghai time) by special train for Rome. He was accompanied by few personnel. According to well-informed sources, Finnish President Svinhufvud, who had arrived here suddenly yesterday, did not travel to Rome on the same train. (Haitong Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>Berlin: German radio announced that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop departed by train for Rome today to exchange views with Italy, accompanied by economic expert Clodius, legal advisor to the Foreign Ministry Kost, Treaty Director Dueneburg, intelligence chief Schmidt, and a large number of secretaries. The first secretary of the Italian Embassy in Berlin, Zapponi, also traveled along. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Political figures here declared that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop departed by train for Rome today to discuss the general European political situation with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano, especially various issues related to Germany and Italy. Political figures pointed out that last autumn, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano came to Berlin and conferred with Hitler and Ribbentrop on the overall situation. Ribbentrop's trip this time is of the same nature as Ciano's visit last autumn. (Haitong Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Since German radio announced the news that the Foreign Minister would go to Rome, there has been much discussion. Foreign observers in Berlin believe that Ribbentrop will directly inform Mussolini of the overall situation in Northern Europe and Germany's position. Some neutral figures in Berlin believe that Ribbentrop will undoubtedly put pressure on Mussolini to take active actions related to the war or the spring offensive on the German side. It is also said that Ribbentrop's trip is related to the return of U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles to the United States via Rome, as it was rumored a week ago that Hitler was eager for Welles to have the impression of the unity of the Rome-Berlin axis. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Berlin: General Göring's mouthpiece, the "Essener National Zeitung," recently published a commentary on the Foreign Minister's visit to Rome today, stating that Germany and Italy will never allow the reactionary forces of the Allies to obstruct the ideal of building Europe. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to Rome will discuss the unchanging common goals of National Socialism and Fascism with the Italian authorities, just like the talks conducted by important German and Italian figures many times before. The newspaper concluded its essay by saying that after the end of the Polish war, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano visited Berlin and held talks with the head of state Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. Several months have passed, and now Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is going to Italy to exchange views with the Italian authorities. After the talks are over, the world situation will undergo a decisive change. (Haitong Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>Rome: After German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop arrived here, all newspapers commented on it, saying that this is the inevitable result of maintaining the "steel axis" between Germany and Italy. The semi-official "Popolo d'Italia" stated that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's sudden arrival here is actually a consequence of the central government's improper handling of German coal measures. He probably wants to use this extraordinary situation to re-establish close relations between Germany and Italy. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Rome: Although rumors of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to Italy had been circulating for some time, it was unexpected that it would happen so quickly. Few Italians knew about it last night. People see Ribbentrop's visit as due to the international situation reaching a critical point. According to political circles, it is not surprising that the two axis powers maintain close contact in times of emergency, and many problems need to be resolved now. It is reasonable for Ribbentrop to personally consult with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. Foreign observers, however, link Ribbentrop's visit to Italy with an unverified report from Danzig that former Finnish President Svinhufvud will arrive in Rome tomorrow, believing that Ribbentrop will explain Germany's attitude towards the Finnish issue to Mussolini, that is, Germany does not allow foreign intervention in the Soviet-Finnish war. It is hoped that Mussolini may mediate and achieve a truce in the Soviet-Finnish war because Italy is eager to avoid the expansion of the scope of the war. Other political observers say that U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles is currently holding talks in several European capitals and will come to Italy again soon, and Ribbentrop's early arrival is probably related to this.

<p>Moscow: Regarding the content of Hitler's talks with Welles on March 3, as reported by the Associated Press, the German Embassy in the Soviet Union issued the following statement: "Regarding the rumors about the negotiations between U.S. Special Envoy Welles in Berlin, reliable German sources state that both sides are still firmly committed to maintaining the lie of not publicly disclosing the details of the negotiations. Therefore, the content reported by foreign newspapers is purely fabricated, and its purpose is to create distrust between Germany and the United States and to mislead the world about Germany's war goals.

<h3>Detention of Coal Issue: Anglo-Italian Negotiations Hope to Be Resolved Smoothly: British Reply Being Drafted</h3>

In addition, according to well-informed sources, the Anglo-Italian economic negotiations have only been temporarily suspended and have not broken down. (Havas, 9th)</p>

<h3>Molotov's 50th Birthday: Soviet Presidium Awards Medals: Several Districts, Towns, Schools, and Factories Named After Molotov: People's Committee Establishes Molotov Scholarship</h3>
<p>Moscow: The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, considering that People's Commissar Molotov has made great contributions to organizing the Bolshevik Party and consolidating the Soviet state, has awarded him the Order of Lenin on his 50th birthday and made the following decisions: (1) In accordance with the will of the Pam regional public group, the Pam district and town will be renamed Molotov District and Town; (2) In accordance with the will of the various public groups in the Norilsk District, the district will be renamed Molotovsk District and Town; (3) The Smolensk Military and Political School and the Gorky Anti-Aircraft Artillery Specialized School will be renamed after Molotov; (4) The Taglau Factory will be renamed Molotov Factory (this change is based on the request of the engineers and workers of the factory). (TASS, 9th)</p>
<p>Moscow: The Soviet People's Committee, in commemoration of Molotov's 50th birthday, decided to establish 300 "Molotov Scholarships" to be awarded to outstanding students in higher education institutions. (TASS, 9th)</p>
<p>Molotov's Life Story</p>
<p>Moscow Molotov was born in March 1890 in the town of Kukarka (Vyatka Province). In 1902, he entered the Kazan Middle School to study. In 1905, he began his revolutionary work, participating in various anti-Imperial Russia rallies and demonstrations. In 1906, he joined the Bolshevik Party. During the difficult period from 1908 to 1912,</p>
<p>In April 1909, he was arrested and exiled to Vologda Province for two years. In 1911, he regained his freedom and entered the St. Petersburg Academy to study. In 1912, he began working for the News. He was one of the editors of Pravda and wrote many great articles. During this period, he had his first meeting with Stalin and participated in the Duma election campaign, guiding the Bolshevik Party in the Duma.</p>
<p>In 1913 and 1914, he was arrested and exiled twice and ordered not to reside in industrial areas and cities again. After the outbreak of the European War in 1914, he arrived in Moscow and reorganized the Moscow Bolshevik organs. In 1915, he was arrested again and exiled to the Menshevik region of Ukrzhe Province for three years, but in 1916, he escaped and returned to Leningrad to continue his revolutionary work. In the autumn of 1916, he served on the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party and directed the revolutionary movement, preparing for the February Revolution of 1917.</p>
<p>After the success of the October Revolution, he became one of the leaders of the Leningrad Workers' and Peasants' Deputies. In early 1918, he served as Chairman of the Northern National Economic Department. In the summer of 1919, he was appointed as the party and government representative of the Volga region. At the end of 1919, he was elected Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Nizhny Novgorod Province. In September 1920, he was appointed Secretary of the Party Committee of the Donets region. In November of the same year, he was appointed Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine. In 1921, he was elected Secretary of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party. In 1926, he was appointed as a member of the Political Bureau of the committee.</p>
<p>From 1921 to 1930, he served as Secretary of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party. On December 19, 1930, he was appointed Chairman of the Soviet People's Committee. He has made great contributions to the construction of the Soviet state. In various developments, he contributed new methods to the country and guided them to success. The development of Soviet industry is largely due to Molotov. Trotsky, Bukharin, and other enemies of the Soviet Union attempted to economically enslave the Soviet Union, but their efforts were defeated by Molotov. He was a major participant in the implementation of Stalin's Five-Year Plan. In 1939, he was re-appointed as Chairman of the People's Committee for Foreign Affairs. Although he was in an extremely complex international situation, he solved many historical problems. The non-aggression and friendship pact signed between the Soviet Union and Germany has shattered the conspiracy of Britain and France to force the Soviet Union into war. At the same time, the Soviet Union has signed mutual assistance pacts with Latvia, Estonia, and other countries. As a result of the Soviet Union's conclusion of a mutual assistance pact with the Finnish People's Government, the crisis of the Finnish Self-Defense Forces attacking Leningrad has been eliminated.

<h3>Rumors of Soviet Mobilization of Young Men</h3>
<p>Stockholm: "Svenska Dagbladet" recently published a dispatch from a correspondent stationed in the capital of Estonia, stating that Soviet People's Commissar for Defense Voroshilov has ordered mobilization, including all young men under the age of 35 in the northern part of the country. This move is enough to make people everywhere suspect that Britain and France intend to wage war against the Soviet Union. (Havas, 9th)</p>

<h3>Finland Striving for Glorious and Lasting Peace with All Its Might: Stockholm and Moscow Become Centers of Diplomatic Activity: Peace Negotiations Now Reaching a Critical Stage</h3>
<p>Sweden: The official content of the demands made by the Soviet Union to Finland via Sweden has not yet been announced. It is reported that it includes a request to cede the Hanko Peninsula, which Finnish figures indicate cannot be accepted under any circumstances. If the Soviet Union insists on this demand, the war will inevitably continue. Political figures in Sweden, however, believe that "glorious and lasting peace" can be guaranteed, and the Finnish government will certainly not give in. (Haitong Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: Finnish negotiations are expected to enter the final stage today. The Soviet Union now appears to insist that peace conditions be decided first, and then a truce be announced. When the Finnish side was still in the early stages of exclusive negotiations, it had already requested a truce. It is learned here that before the start of the negotiations, the Swedish authorities constantly worked to establish a foothold between the two sides, which lasted for many weeks, as both sides feared being seen as showing weakness in their preparations. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Regarding the peace talks between Finland and the Soviet Union, according to reliable sources, the Finnish government will not issue a public statement before the 11th of this month. As for the conditions proposed by the Soviet Union, the cabinet members have roughly the same understanding and are carefully considering whether to accept them or not. From the perspective of the military situation, the resistance of the Finnish army has not collapsed and is continuing to fight on the Karelian Isthmus and the frozen waters of the Gulf of Finland. Well-informed sources say that the Finnish representatives went to Moscow to explore the views of the Soviet government, and formal negotiations have not yet begun. As for the talks held by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop with former Finnish President Svinhufvud in Berlin yesterday, political circles did not initially attach importance to them because Svinhufvud had retired from politics many years ago. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Paris: According to the latest news, the Finnish delegation, led by Minister Without Portfolio Paasikivi, is conducting talks with the Soviet government in Moscow. Former Finnish President Svinhufvud has also gone to Berlin. In addition, according to various sources, famous Finnish industrialist Gallen is also working for peace. Gallen recently returned to Europe from the Bahamas in the West Indies via the United States, traveled on the Italian liner "Rex" with U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles, and maintained close contact with Welles. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Paris: According to sources here, the representatives of Finland participating in the Moscow talks are Foreign Minister Erkko and Mr. Paasikivi, who engaged in Soviet-Finnish negotiations before the war. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>London: According to a cashless telegram from Helsinki, former Finnish President Svinhufvud has met with Hitler in Berlin. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Moscow: Today, the U.S. Embassy and the Swedish Legation here have become centers of diplomatic activity. Ambassadors from various countries have either gone there in person or contacted them by telephone. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: A message from Helsinki states that if the current peace talks fail, the Finnish army will devote all its efforts, supplemented by foreign aid, to take a new initiative. Finnish politicians who were previously in Stockholm have now left. It is reported that former Finnish President Svinhufvud and Paasikivi, who handled pre-war negotiations with the Soviet Union, have also left here. According to observers here, in addition to Finnish government officials and Soviet leaders, there are many parties involved in the peace talks, such as the Finnish army. Any government that accepts conditions not approved by the Finnish army will find itself in a difficult situation, and the attitudes of Germany, Britain, and France are also relevant. This is a factor that Sweden often pays attention to. At the same time, although the wording of the Finnish communiqué is optimistic, the Finnish war situation does not seem to be completely reassuring, as its continued resistance depends on the speed with which it receives effective foreign aid. It was recently stated by officialdom that telephone traffic between Stockholm and various European countries, which was interrupted yesterday to prevent rumors from spreading abroad, has now been restored. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>"A Mother Who Is Not Free is Dead" - Tragic Words of a Finn</h3>
<p>London: "The Times" published a dispatch from a correspondent stationed in Helsinki stating that if the peace terms are humiliating to the country, most of the people are still determined to defend freedom and independence. "An important person told me that Finland should continue to fight, even if such fighting is tantamount to suicide. Before we die for our country, we should first kill our wives to avoid falling into the hands of the enemy, but before we resort to this last resort, we can still fight for a year. Even if Finland is finally destroyed, this heroic and tragic struggle will surely be remembered for generations to come, and the major powers of Western Europe will be infamous for failing to provide assistance." (Havas, 9th)</p>
<h3>Swedish Official Statement: Only Adopting a Neutral Position: Eager for Finland to Maintain Independence and Freedom: Difficult to Stay Out of a Protracted War</h3>
<p>Stockholm: Swedish officials issued a statement yesterday regarding Sweden's mediation of the Soviet-Finnish conflict, declaring that the Swedish government has not put any pressure on Finland, and its work is no more than a diplomatic post office. It is undeniable that Sweden is eager to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Soviet-Finnish war on terms acceptable to Finland. Sweden is willing to be a technical mediator, transmitting the Soviet proposal to the Finnish government. This request was submitted to the Swedish Minister to the Soviet Union by the Soviet government and has been forwarded to the Finnish government from Stockholm. Swedish political figures attach great importance to the fact that Moscow is having difficulty negotiating with the Helsinki government, because the Soviet Union initially supported the Finnish "People's Government" headed by Kuusinen at the beginning of the war, and now re-opening negotiations with Helsinki means that the "People's Government" is fleeting. (Haitong Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: Prime Minister Hansson's mouthpiece, "Social-Demokraten," recently published an article on the Soviet-Finnish war, stating that it is in the main interests of the Scandinavian countries to establish a glorious peace between the Soviet Union and Finland so that Finland can maintain its independence and freedom. "The longer the war lasts, the harder it will be for Sweden and the entire Scandinavian Peninsula to stay out of it. If Western countries intervene, we will have little choice but to go along. In short, we know very well what the intentions of 99% of the people will be if we are forced to decide our attitude in the future, but we also know that 99% of the people are eager to avoid this dilemma. As far as the current peace talks are concerned, their nature is very fragile, and this is the reality. Therefore, we cannot be overly optimistic and should continue to support Finland with all our strength and strengthen our country's resistance to the highest limit." (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>The Hague: "De Telegraaf" recently published a dispatch from a correspondent stationed in Helsinki stating, "The attitude of Sweden has made the Finnish people feel depressed. They believe that the future of Finland, to a large extent, will be determined by whether Sweden is willing to provide military assistance. As for Sweden's mediation, it is speculated that its intention is to prevent Britain and France from providing large-scale assistance to Finland, so as to avoid Sweden being drawn into the vortex." (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>London: Swedish figures here recently stated that before mediating the dispute between Finland and the Soviet Union, the Swedish government informed the Turkish government of its intention. The Swedish Minister to Britain held talks with the Turkish Ambassador to Britain, Rushdi, last week, which was related to this matter. Diplomatic figures say that apart from what is stated in the newspapers about the peace plan between Finland and the Soviet Union, little is known about its true content. In any case, the power of final decision still rests with Finland. So far, the authorities of that country do not seem to have made any decision. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Once Asked Britain to Mediate: But Was Rejected by the British Side</h3>
<p>London: Regarding the peace talks between Finland and the Soviet Union, well-informed sources here recently stated that ten days ago, Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky asked Foreign Office officials whether he would convey the country's peace terms to the Finnish government, but Foreign Office officials believed that the content of the conditions he described was difficult to accept. They only agreed to inform the Finnish government that the Soviet Union had made a peace proposal, but were unwilling to convey it on its behalf. In addition, it is heard that Ambassador Maisky stated to Foreign Office officials that the Soviet Union had not established a political agreement or military alliance treaty with Germany, but Britain still refused to act as a mediator. The ambassador was quite unhappy at the time. As for Sweden's mediation, it is actually the result of the joint pressure of Germany and the Soviet Union. It is generally believed that these countries warned Sweden that the Soviet Union did not originally harbor any ambitions towards the Scandinavian countries, but if Sweden becomes a tool of Britain and France and refuses to put pressure on Finland, then Germany and the Soviet Union will be forced to unite and deal with it. The peace conditions put forward by the Soviet government this time did not involve the demilitarization of the Åland Islands, which was intended to please Sweden. It goes without saying that under this situation of enticement and threat, the Swedish government finally handed over the Soviet peace conditions to Finland. Although the Finnish government was extremely unwelcome, it agreed to send a delegation to Moscow for negotiations at the urging of the Swedish authorities. In short, the Soviet Union clearly wants to end the Finnish war as soon as possible. This is due to the slow progress of military operations and the fear of active intervention by Britain and France. It is unlikely that the country can therefore reduce its demands. In any case, Britain and France are still preparing to step up aid to Finland, but everything is still up to that country to decide. It is regrettable that Sweden, under the direct threat of Germany, has made it difficult for Britain and France to aid Finland with its "neutral policy," and the Finnish government's dilemma can be imagined.

<h3>Moscow Radio Station Stops Anti-Finnish Programs</h3>
<p>London. Moscow Radio did not mention the Soviet-Finnish war last night. The anti-Finnish programs, broadcast daily in foreign languages since the outbreak of the Soviet-Finnish war, have now also been discontinued. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>If a Formal Application is Received, Britain and France Will Assist Finland with Strength. Finland's Fate is Left to the Finns to Decide; They Will Never Allow German Domination of Northern Europe.</h3>
<p>Paris. Well-informed sources here say that Britain and France do not wish to put pressure on Finland regarding the current peace negotiations. If Finland wishes the Allied countries to continue to provide assistance, they only need to say so, and the Allied countries are prepared to respond. It is widely felt that the Swedish government has assumed a great responsibility before its own country and world opinion. Sweden, due to its close relationship with Finland, is said to have exerted great pressure on Finland and has hinted at stopping current indirect aid. It is said that the Soviet Union's new demands are tantamount to placing Finland in the position of Czechoslovakia after the Munich Conference. Its demands include the cession of the Petsamo region along with its nickel mines and fishing rights, the dismantling of coastal batteries, and the abandonment of Viipuri and all Finnish territory on Lake Ladoga. "Le Temps" states that this matter should be decided by the Finns themselves. What the Finns need to know is that Britain and France are indeed prepared to give greater and more direct assistance. Like a flood cannot be divided, the disaster of Nazism and the disaster of the Soviet Union cannot be separated. This is what the Finns and the people of various countries hesitating on the edge of war should remember. It is reported that the military supplies transported by Britain and France to Finland, including those already delivered and en route, total 405 aircraft, including 67 bombers, 916 artillery pieces, more than 2.5 million shells, 5,000 light machine guns, 124 heavy machine guns, 150 anti-tank guns, 450,000 bombs, 1,050 naval mines, 10,000 landmines, and 56 million rounds of ammunition. At least two-thirds of the above military supplies have now been delivered. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>London. London officials are greatly disturbed by the widespread rumors that the Soviet Union and Finland are about to negotiate peace. Authoritative sources believe that the domination of the Scandinavian countries by the Soviet Union and Germany would be a failure for the Allied countries. Their concerns are based on the following reasons: (1) After the Soviet Union and Germany dominate Finland and the Scandinavian Peninsula, they will be able to obtain the iron ore they need from Gällivare, Kiruna, and Kirunavaara in Sweden, which are the world's third-largest iron-producing areas. (2) The northern coast of Germany will be almost completely immune from Allied attacks. From an economic point of view, this is the most valuable area in Germany. (3) Since Soviet Russia is free from war, it can cooperate with Germany to exploit raw materials and transport them to Germany, while also guarding Germany's Balkan border. Some observers predict that the Allied countries will one day pass through that area to attack Germany. (4) After the successive collapses of Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, the Balkan countries are paying close attention to the outcome of Finland. If Finland also collapses, these countries' trust in the Allied countries will be less than before, as the Allied countries are considered to be closely related to Finland. (5) If Finland surrenders and is dominated by Germany and the Soviet Union, Germany and the Soviet Union may force Norway to allow Germany to use the Me Kong base in Denmark, so that it can attack the British North Sea Fleet from there. This is also a possibility. In short, the complex situation of the entire European war may change due to Finland's decision in the next two or three weeks. As for the person in charge of this major war plan, it should be General Mannerheim. (International News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>Copenhagen. According to authoritative reports, Finland intends to decide within a few hours to directly request Britain and France to send reinforcements to defend against the invasion of the Red Army. If this news is true, then the war may spread to the Scandinavian countries. According to a quick report from London, Britain is asking Sweden to allow it to transport troops through its territory. If so, then the opinion here that Britain hopes Finland will ask for help can be confirmed. According to reliable sources, whether Finland will take this measure depends on whether Sweden can mediate the Soviet-Finnish conflict. Sweden's task is to make the conditions proposed by the Soviet Union closer to what Finland can accept, and to make what Finland can accept closer to what the Soviet Union demands. If the Soviet Union's demands cannot be greatly reduced, or if Norway and Sweden do not send strong reinforcements to Finland, then the general public expects that Finland will directly ask the Allied countries for help, and believes that the Allied countries will not refuse. (Special Correspondent Fukazawa, International News Agency, 9th)</p>
<h3>Finland's War or Peace Plan Against the Soviet Union Depends on General Mannerheim</h3>
<p>Danzig. A reporter from the Hai Tong News Agency recently learned that if the activities of mediating the Soviet-Finnish conflict in the Swedish capital are unsuccessful, when the foreign ministers of the Scandinavian countries met in Danzig on February 25, Swedish Foreign Minister Günther told the foreign ministers of Denmark and Norway that it was possible to mediate the Soviet-Finnish conflict. Swedish Foreign Minister Günther made this statement in the hope that Denmark and Norway could at least participate in this effort morally, because at that time, Swedish Foreign Minister Günther believed that Finland's cession of territory was unavoidable. Therefore, political figures here, after reading the official report issued by the Danzig meeting, also understood that the three Scandinavian countries all hoped to maintain Finland's independence by following a possible path to resolve the conflict. People in Norway say that the Finnish government has handed over the decision-making power on war and peace to General Mannerheim, so Foreign Minister Günther's statement that it is possible to stop the Soviet-Finnish conflict may not be entirely true. General Mannerheim and the country's former president, Pehr Evind Svinhufvud, have different political views. General Mannerheim has always been pro-British and pro-French. His repeated visits to London and his repeated appeals, hoping that Western countries would help Finland under any circumstances, can be seen as a glimpse of his trust in Britain and France. On the contrary, Svinhufvud often advocated a policy of close ties with Germany. When Finland won its independence in 1918, Svinhufvud personally went to Berlin to ask Germany for assistance to Finland, but General Mannerheim expressed his opposition. In the spring of 1939, there was a proposal for Germany and Finland to conclude a non-aggression pact, but it was not successful. Therefore, it is decided whether the activities participated in by Svinhufvud will succeed or fail. The final decision still rests with General Mannerheim. (Hai Tong News Agency, 9th)</p>
<h3>US Government Officials are Concerned about the European Situation; US Ambassador to Moscow Has Long Talks with Foreign Minister Molotov</h3>
<p>Washington. An official from the State Department said today that the US government has not received any formal or informal requests to mediate the Soviet-Finnish war. The State Department is now greatly concerned about the news of peace hopes, but there is no further action. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Moscow. US Ambassador to Moscow Steinhardt held talks with Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov for two hours yesterday. It is widely believed that they discussed the possibility of the United States mediating the Soviet-Finnish war. Steinhardt also met with the Swedish Minister to the Soviet Union and other diplomatic representatives here. (United Press, 9th)</p>
<h3>Germany Issues Warning to Britain and France; If They Assist Finland with Force, It Will Lead to Unfortunate Consequences</h3>
<p>Stockholm. Foreign observers in Berlin recently stated that German political figures have denied the claim that Germany and Sweden are jointly mediating the war between Finland and the Soviet Union, but warned that if Britain and France send troops or mercenaries to directly assist Finland, Germany will believe that Western European countries intend to expand the scope of the war and create a new anti-German front. If this is the case, the overall situation will be completely changed, and the German government will have to prepare to take necessary decisions. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Rome. Italian newspapers welcome the attempt to mediate the Soviet-Finnish war and expect the possibility of restoring peace and eliminating a crisis in the entire Europe. But in Germany, the German government does not allow newspapers to mention the Soviet-Finnish peace talks, and only prints in large font the news from Northern Europe criticizing the Allied countries for preparing to send troops to land on the Scandinavian Peninsula. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>Soviet-Finnish War Report; Soviet Offensive in the Viipuri Area Repelled by Finnish Forces</h3>
<p>Moscow. According to a communique from the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, there were no major developments on the front line yesterday. In the Gulf of Viipuri, Soviet troops occupied Isosaari Island, Isosaari Town, Kiiskisaari Island, Lakkasaari Town, Turkkisaari Island, Monstereisaari Town, Häytesaari Island, and Häytesaari Town. Soviet troops captured 12 artillery pieces, 57 machine guns, and 2 million rounds of ammunition. The Soviet Air Force bombed enemy troops and shot down two enemy planes in air combat. (TASS, 9th)</p>
<p>Helsinki. The General Headquarters issued a war report stating, "The Red Army units intensified their attacks yesterday and today in the area from Koivisto to Lake Ladoga, but were all repelled. Our artillery effectively destroyed many enemy tanks and artillery pieces. The Red Army left behind 400 bodies between Viipuri and Vuoksi Lake. Casualties were especially heavy on the River Kollaa. The number of bodies left behind is estimated to be over 2,000. In addition, at least six enemy planes were shot down by our forces today." (Havas, 8th)</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles in Chenghai and Chaoan for Several Days; Chinese Troops Abandon Chenghai City After Capturing It; Japanese Troops from Guangzhou Rush to Chaoan for Reinforcements Overnight</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The Huazhenzhong Brigade of the Chinese Army launched a three-pronged attack on Chaoan City on February 26. One route started from Tiandongxu, Fengshun, detoured through Qiulang Mountain and Zhuxiang, and attacked Yixi Station outside the North Gate. Another route crossed the river from Gebu Fushi and attacked Shuangjingshan. One route set out from the Anjie Highway, attacked Xucuoxiang, and Hougou, Chihu, Moweixiang, and Chunchenglou outside the South Gate. Another route set out from Fengfeng Mountain, Raoping, and stationed troops on the left bank of the Han River. The three sides advanced fiercely at the same time. That afternoon, they had advanced to Shuangjingshan and Zhugaoshan, narrowing the encirclement and engaging in fierce battles with the Japanese army. The Japanese army relied on the defensive fortifications on the mountain to hold on stubbornly. The sound of artillery fire rumbled all day long. The Japanese and puppet troops in various strongholds such as Shantou, Chenghai, Anbu, and Huamei all went to aid. The original sentry posts of the Japanese army checking pedestrians at the key traffic points in Shantou City were also replaced by puppet police. The plainclothes team in the suburbs of Shantou immediately sneaked into the city, posting slogans on the streets or giving public speeches, which was very active.</p>
<p>Recapture Chenghai</p>
<p>The Chinese troops Li Shaoru and Hong Zhizheng and other units stationed in Zhanglin Donglong, Chenghai, had already joined forces with the New Sixth Division in mid-month. On the evening of the 26th, in order to respond to the Chinese troops in Chaoan, they crossed the river in the dark of night and attacked Chenghai City. The able-bodied men bravely climbed the city walls and attacked the Japanese camp. About 400 Japanese troops in the city closed the city and defended it firmly, opening fire and bombarding the outside of the city indiscriminately. At this time, a fire had already broken out in the city, and street fighting occurred, killing more than 200 Japanese troops. The remaining Japanese and puppet troops retreated to Waisha Xiapu Ouding on the 17th. Flour, foreign rice, kerosene, military supplies, etc. were left in the city, all of which were seized by the Chinese army. Then a transportation team of 4,000 people swept and transported all of them onto boats and transported them to the rear in Raoping. On the evening of the 27th, the Chinese army swept towards Waisha and forced an attack on the outskirts of Shantou City. Chaos had broken out in Fulong, Jinsha, Shawei, Qishan, Xinxiang, Longwei, Taizihan and other areas 10 li away from Shantou City. There were also gunshots and artillery fire in Shantou City. All shops and houses were closed. The Japanese troops in the city moved to the Qilu Waimalu Airport by the sea, preparing to get on ships and leave. At the railway station and on the Wuqiaoban, Tongji Road, there were 300 to 400 remaining Japanese soldiers guarding the intersection, cutting off traffic in and out of the city.</p>
<p>Intercept Japanese Troops</p>
<p>After the Chinese army captured Chenghai City, it blocked the retreat route of the Japanese troops in Chaoan on the railway line of Huamei and Caitang City, and quickly joined forces with the Chinese troops in Sangpu Mountain, Pannanshan, and Wugang. At this time, the focus of the war shifted to Hougou, Xiasi, Chihu, Yunlishan, and Zhugaoshan outside the South Gate of Chaoan. The fighting was most fierce on the 28th. Japanese planes flew to Chaoan in turn to help in the battle, because the Japanese troops there had been trapped for several days, and their food, ammunition, and water had all run out. They were cut off from the strongholds between Shantou and Anbu, and their responses were ineffective. More than 3,000 Japanese troops in Chaoan suffered more than 1,000 casualties in the recent ten days. On the 28th, eight Japanese transport ships stopped near Dadun, and four stopped on the sea surface of Qilu. The Japanese troops secretly sent the wounded soldiers and documents into the ships at night, intending to withdraw. On the one hand, they urgently requested help from the Southern China Dispatch Army in Guangzhou. The Japanese commander Ando specially mobilized 3,000 Japanese troops to board ships from Huangpu Taiping, and they had arrived in Shantou on the 29th, and were transported to Waisha overnight by armed motorboats to land. In addition, 16 electric boats carried more than 300 Japanese soldiers to Chenghai, Donglong, and Nanyang to invade, but before they could land, they were ambushed by the militia, and 40 to 50 people were killed or injured. Seeing that the Chinese troops in Zhanglin Donglong were prepared, the Japanese motorboats turned to sail up the tributary of the Han River, landed at Longhu, and marched north along the Hudi Road to rescue Chaoan. In addition, motorboats carried soldiers to land outside the East Gate of Chenghai, and near Anbu, Meixitou, Xianhu, Xiedu, and Daya. The Chinese team fought on the plains intertwined with rivers. The transportation was inconvenient, and the advance and retreat were out of control. Therefore, Chenghai City was lost again on the early morning of March 1, which was the fourth abandonment. When Chenghai City was captured on February 27, it was expected that it would be difficult to hold it for a long time, and the Japanese and puppet troops withdrew from the city and hid in Guanshan Township and Waisha Township, waiting for reinforcements. On March 1, fierce battles took place in these two places, and 300 to 400 Japanese and puppet troops were killed or injured. There were no battles in the near suburbs of Chenghai. 300 Japanese reinforcements boarded 16 motorboats and landed near Daya, east of Anbu, before noon on the 29th. It happened that the Chinese army withdrew from Pannanshan, preparing to cross back to Chenghai. The bamboo rafts by the shore were occupied by Japanese boats as docks. Seeing this, the Chinese army ambushed on the shore and fired from above, which was completely unexpected by the Japanese army. After two hours of melee, two Japanese motorboats were sunk. The Japanese army suffered another 70 to 80 casualties. The Chinese army seized the motorboat, planted a Japanese flag, crossed Chenghai, and returned smoothly to the Longdu Dushu position.</p>
<p>Chaos in Chaoan</p>
<p>On the Chaoan side, after the Japanese reinforcements arrived, they launched a fierce counterattack. The war map was quite fierce in Bijia Mountain, Yunli Mountain, Yunti Mountain, Chihu, Xiasi, Yunbu City, and Longhu outside the city. Three Japanese planes took turns flying low to help in the battle. More than 1,000 Japanese infantry and cavalry rushed out of the Chihu stronghold on the morning of the 29th and pounced on the northwest mountains. The Japanese cavalry saw that the Chinese army's mountain dangerous areas were destroyed by Japanese planes, whipped their horses and rushed into Linjiazhuang, fighting hand-to-hand four times. The Chinese army was ambushed in the forest, setting up hunting traps and tripwires. The Japanese cavalry's horse feet were tripped by the Chinese army with hemp ropes, blocking the following troops of the Japanese army. Dead people and dead horses were piled up on the road in the fields in front of Linjiazhuang. The two sides fought fiercely until 1 pm. The fresh troops stationed in Fengxi by the Chinese also arrived and defeated the Japanese troops who rushed out of Chihu. Taking advantage of the victory, they swept through the area. In the evening, the Chinese army had approached Xiasi Chihu, and 200 to 300 people were captured along the way, and more than 70 rifles and machine guns, steel helmets, military flags and other trophies were seized. There were also nine puppet soldiers, who were originally local able-bodied men who were forced to become soldiers. Seeing that the Japanese army was defeated, they carried their guns from the Guanyin Temple in Linjiazhuang and surrendered to the Chinese army, turned their guns and joined the war, leading the Chinese army to search the side of the Guanyin Temple, killing six Japanese officers and capturing a war horse and two machine guns.</p>
<h3>High Prices for Everything in Dinghai</h3>
<p>Dinghai Correspondence: Various goods in this county have recently been controlled by the Japanese and puppet authorities, and the source is scarce, resulting in rising prices and the people are unable to make a living. At present, the price of rice in the city is 32 yuan per shi, pork is 1 yuan per jin, vegetable oil is 1 yuan per jin, sesame oil is 1.3 yuan per jin, lard is 1 yuan for 14 taels, soybeans are 26 yuan per shi, glutinous rice is 2.5 he per yuan, early rice is 12 yuan per 100 jin, candles are more than 6 yuan per jin, soft firewood is 5 fen per jin, hard firewood is 8 fen per jin, sweet potatoes are 6 fen per jin, sweet potato silk is 1 jiao per jin, medium-sized tin foil is more than 200 yuan per yuan, eggs are 9 fen each, duck eggs are 1.1 jiao each, matches are 3 fen per pack, kerosene is 1.2 yuan each, longan is 2.1 yuan per jin, soap is 2 jiao per piece, cotton is 9 jiao or 1.3 yuan per jin, old wine is 2 jiao per jin, and silk and cloth are more than doubled compared to before. A cloth coat cannot be made without 10 yuan (formerly only 5 yuan). Vegetables are extremely expensive, costing several jiao per jin, because the villagers dare not enter the city. Before the war, it was only 20 wen per jin. Fish was very cheap. Before the war, a yellow croaker only cost 5 fen, but now it costs no less than 3 to 4 jiao. When there is wind and rain, it is difficult to catch fish, and the price rises to 6 to 7 jiao per fish. Salt was only a little over 1 fen per jin before the war, but now it costs 7 fen or 1 jiao per jin. Other items such as cigarettes, cosmetics, stationery, books, etc. are even more expensive, more than twice as expensive as before the war. The residents of Dinghai are in dire straits in this high cost of living, which can be described as suffering.</p>
<h3>Japanese and Puppet Troops Occupy Chonggu Town, Qingpu; The Town Has Been Blockaded by Guerrillas</h3>
<p>Qingpu Correspondence: Chonggu, Guanyintang, and other towns in the eastern part of Qingpu have been controlled by the 3rd Detachment of the Songhu Guerrilla Force since the withdrawal of the Chinese troops to the west, maintaining law and order, and the people lived and worked in peace. However, since Jin Honggao, the captain of the 1st Brigade of the Qingpu County Puppet Security Team, was executed by the guerrillas in October last year, the Japanese and puppet troops, in retaliation, suddenly dispatched Jiang Akao's unit of the 3rd Brigade of the Qingpu County Puppet Security Team, together with more than 60 Japanese troops, to attack Chonggu by motorboat on the 14th day of the 12th lunar month last year. At that time, the 2nd Detachment of the 3rd Detachment met the enemy on separate routes, but because the timing was not right, after killing several puppet soldiers, they immediately withdrew. After the Japanese and puppet troops occupied Chonggu, they piled up sandbags, barbed wire, and built brick walls several feet high and thick on the Xiaolong thoroughfare to prevent the guerrillas from counterattacking. The materials used were dismantled from the Fuquan Mountain Primary School in the town and the ancient Leizu Temple with a history of 500 years, and the rest were collected. The discipline of the puppet army was gone, and villagers were tied up day and night. To this day, no less than hundreds of people have been tied up, and they have extorted and plundered everything. It is now known that the guerrillas, in addition to planning to attack by surprise, are implementing a policy of blocking the four suburbs. Pedestrians are only allowed to leave but not enter, and all rice and goods are not allowed to be imported. Therefore, the once prosperous rice market is now silent. It is also heard that the Japanese and puppet troops occupied Chonggu, originally wanting to collect rice donations and various taxes from the fields, but now there is no rice market in the town, and the four villages are still controlled by the guerrillas, so it is impossible to implement. They have to rely on kidnapping, theft, and looting to live.</p>

<h3>Central Government Increases Funding for Sichuan University by More Than 250,000 Yuan Annually</h3>
<p>(Chengdu Airmail) National Sichuan University is a higher education institution in the Southwest and the only complete university in the country. Since Mr. Cheng Dafang took over as president of the university, he has been working hard to reorganize it. However, due to insufficient funding in the past, all facilities have been quite difficult. In order to seek the long-term development of the university and to complete the national plan for cultivating talents, Mr. Cheng went to Chongqing at the end of last month to request increased funding from the central government. The central government has now formally approved an additional 257,000 yuan in funding each year.

<h3>Food: Imported Rice Continues to Fall, Down Another Two Yuan; Arrivals Very Strong, Another 70,000 Bags Today; Rice Industry Brewing Over Weekly Closing</h3>
<p>The recent rice market has plummeted and become irreversibly depressed. The continuous arrival of futures this month has made it difficult to circulate funds. Those holding goods find it difficult to hold on. The market is extremely crowded. Guests who see the drastic changes in the market are cautious. Therefore, the opening price this morning was half a yuan lower. However, people's minds are increasingly tired, causing rice prices to fall more and more sharply. By the time the market closed at noon, except for mixed broken rice, which was in short supply and sold more widely and able to hold steady, falling by half a yuan to a yuan, from 35 yuan to 34 yuan, other types of imported rice fell sharply by 1.5 to 2 yuan each. No. 1 Saigon was 44 yuan, 43.5 yuan, No. 2 Saigon was 41 yuan, falling to 40 yuan, high-quality fire-dried Binta brand was 42.5 yuan, mixed brand was 42 yuan, No. 2 Siamese rice was 39.35 yuan, small fire-dried rice was 38 yuan, Tokyo pointed rice was 38.2 yuan, 38 yuan. Seeing that the overall trend is declining and people's minds are depressed, there is still hope for a small rebound. Moreover, sales are decreasing day by day. It seems difficult to expect a turnaround at this time, and the continued decline may be expected.</p>
<p>The sale of imported rice is also felt by floating households, retail customers, and weak trading firms. The pressure on funds is felt even more. Overseas reports are frequently small, and foreign merchants are selling No. 2 Saigon rice for less than 50 yuan, and No. 1 Saigon rice is also lower than 52 or 53 yuan. Although traders do not dare to continue ordering, the market and people's minds are even more pressured. Therefore, after the market opened this morning, the selling pressure in the market was extremely strong. The prices of various imported rice were falling, and they were lower than the previous day by one to two yuan. There was also a lack of buyers for repurchased futures. The March Siamese No. 2 rice fell from 49.6 yuan to 49 yuan, and the small fire-dried rice fell from 48.2 yuan, also by one yuan. The turnover was less than 200 tons. There are currently only more than 3,000 bags of imported rice.</p>
<p>More imported rice has arrived. Ewo's Yisheng Wheel brought 6,656 bags from Haiphong, and another 7,588 bags from Hong Kong, totaling 14,244 bags, which were imported yesterday morning and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. According to yesterday's report, the Yu Berlin Wheel, managed by the Zhaohua Company, loaded more than 71,000 bags of rice in Saigon to Shanghai, originally scheduled to arrive yesterday. According to the company's telegram yesterday, it will not be able to import until today, and it will still dock at the Gonghexian Wharf in Hongkou as planned for unloading. (Zu)</p>
<p>Glutinous rice continued to be affected by imported rice, and the market was flat. Prices followed the fall by half a yuan to one yuan. The source of thick and thin japonica domestic rice has recently become sporadic due to various difficulties. Yesterday, it was still in this state. Only three to five hundred bags were transferred out of Hongkou, and most of them were goods stored in the past. Only five or six cars of Danyang and other white rice have arrived. However, it is rumored that goods from the Taicang area may be cleared soon. If it can be realized, it is indeed a blessing for the people's food. As for off-market trading, it is heard that it is still quiet. Only early and late rice in Nangang are slightly traded, and the price is 45 yuan. Because the price of this cargo is the lowest, it is quite suitable for general stores to cope with retail sales. Therefore, it is easier to sell than thick japonica rice.</p>
<p>The traders in Xiaoguanghan Rice Market, because all the warehouses are closed every Sunday and cannot sample, which often causes invisible business interruptions, feel very inconvenient. Following the precedent of the Grocery Association's holiday on Sundays, it is planned to close the business for one day every Sunday starting next week to facilitate the organization of business. Therefore, more than 90 traders have signed in favor of this measure yesterday, accounting for two-thirds of the entire industry. It only needs to be approved by the association meeting before it can be announced and implemented.</p>
<h3>Factory Powder Unchanged; Repurchased Goods Fluctuate Slightly; Suzhou Wheat Falls to 23 Yuan</h3>
<p>The powder market was initially weak and then stabilized. The factory's price for the first-class powder has not changed during the flat selling period. The repurchased goods fluctuate slightly with the sales situation. Yesterday morning, the old car brand warehouse receipt opened at 14.25 yuan. Later, due to slight movements in the rural areas of the interior, the price returned to 14.3 yuan and 14.35 yuan. It is heard that the price of Green Cannon Car is 14.65 yuan, but there is no official market. This kind of environment may still have a period of brewing. 240 bags of powder were shipped to Xiamen on the 10th.</p>
<p>Wheat trading is still quiet. Both the Chinese factory and the export gang are rarely interested. The Japanese factory also wants to suppress the price and take it. Therefore, only one or two cars of Suzhou wheat were opened throughout the day, and the price was 23 yuan, which was 8 jiao lower than the opening price the previous day. There were no proper transactions for other goods.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Uptrend Unstoppable</h3>
<p>After the soybean market once trended down, actual sales have expanded in the past two days. General speculators took advantage of the trend to stir up trouble. People's minds in the market were excited, and the rush to buy was popular again. The market situation was quite strong. Yesterday, the market saw further jumps. The highest price of Bengbu beans reached 24 yuan again, and seven or eight cars were traded, with prices ranging from 21.4 yuan to 24 yuan. More than 1,300 bags of Dingjiazhou beans were traded, with prices ranging from 24.8 yuan to 25.3 yuan. More than 800 bags of Wuhu beans were traded, with prices ranging from 20.05 yuan to 23 yuan. More than 400 bags of Nanjing beans were traded, with prices ranging from 19.5 yuan to 22.5 yuan. One car of Chuzhou beans was traded, with the price at 22.5 yuan. 100 bags of Sangyuan beans were traded, with the price at 19.5 yuan. 200 bags of Qingdao beans were traded, with the price at 29 yuan. One-fourth of the sales market was taken by hoarders, and the rest was taken by oil mills, carriage workshops, local streets, and Nanyang, etc.</p>
<p>Today (10th), 615 packages of soybeans, 595 packages of raw peanuts, and 1,500 bean cakes are available for export to Xiamen. Another 645 packages of soybeans and 480 cans of raw oil will be shipped to Hong Kong. Only 520 packages of soybeans will be shipped to Singapore.</p>
<h3>Finance: Exchange Market Quiet, Trend Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market was affected by the fact that the exchange rate of US dollars against British pounds overseas turned downward and plummeted by more than four points. Therefore, the HSBC and US dollar exchange rates in this city were reduced by 0.0625 to 6.5 yuan. The Dutch guilder, Japanese yen, and other exchange rates also saw slight reductions. Other exchange rates, such as the British pound, were relatively stable. The intraday situation was still quite quiet, and the potential trend was still stable. The recent domestic and foreign news has been quite good, and the Hong Kong telegram was slightly blocked on the same day. Therefore, the market trend was slightly firm. At the morning opening, the old pattern of British pound flat and US dollar tight reappeared. The British pound was still quoted at 4 shillings and 1.125 pence, and the US dollar was 6.6875 yuan. After the opening, foreign firms slightly bought in, but there was no impact. Soon after, the Hong Kong telegram issued a sell order first, and the money exchange industry followed with a tight order. The situation became slightly loose. Since then, buyers and sellers have been waiting and watching, and the turnover has become even more scarce. The market closed in a stable state at 4 shillings and 1.140625 pence and 6.71875 yuan. As a result, the British pound was 0.015625 looser and the US dollar was 0.03125 tighter than the previous day. The trend of futures was the same as that of spot.</p>
<p>British Pound Looser, US Dollar Slightly Tighter</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the London big bar was up 1.875 for the near term and up 2.5 for the far term. The New York silver price was still flat, and the London raw gold was fixed. The exchange rates of British pound against US, Shanghai, and French currencies were all flat. The US dollar fell sharply by four points against the British pound, remained unchanged against Shanghai, and fell sharply by 2.25 points against the French franc. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling price was 4 shillings and 1.125 pence for British gold and 6.6875 yuan for the US dollar, which was flat for the British pound and 0.0625 tighter for the US dollar compared to the previous close. This was due to the decline in the exchange rate. After the opening, foreign firms first bought into HSBC spot British gold at 4 shillings and 1.125 pence. Supply and demand were balanced, and there was a lack of change. Soon after, the Hong Kong telegram issued a sell order, so the market became slightly firm. It is estimated that spot British gold was sold to foreign firms at 4 shillings and 1.140625 pence. At that time, it was difficult to close the US dollar at 6.71875 yuan. The HSBC listed price was announced, with the British pound flat and the US dollar reduced by 0.0625. The silver balance tax was announced at 0.75. After that, the money exchange industry also followed suit and sold US dollar bills at 6.8125 yuan to a Chinese-Italian bank, causing the market situation to continue to be slightly loose. British gold at 4 shillings and 1.140625 pence and the US dollar at 6.71875 yuan could be closed. Later, the foreign firms came back to close the US dollar at 6.6875 yuan for this month with a certain bank. Afterwards, the turnover became even clearer, and the situation was flat. By the time of the noon close, British gold was 4 shillings and 1.140625 pence, and the US dollar was 6.71875 yuan. This month's British gold was 4 shillings and 1.125 pence, and the US dollar was 6.6875 yuan. Next month's futures British gold was 4 shillings and 0.078125 pence, and the US dollar was 6.59375 yuan. As a result, the near-term British pound was 0.015625 looser and the US dollar was 0.03125 tighter than the previous day. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 9th (Saturday) Telegram: The exchange market opened this morning with turbulence. The British pound spot opened unchanged, and the far-term was tighter by 0.03125 to 1 shilling and 2.8125 pence. The US dollar spot shrunk sharply by 3.125 to 24 yuan. The Shanghai exchange spot fell by 2.5 yuan to 356.5 yuan. The Japanese yen spot also tightened by 1 yuan to 102.25 yuan. At 10:00 a.m., the market was slightly soft.

The US dollar spot and the Shanghai exchange remained unchanged, still at 6.0625 yuan and 110.75 yuan. The "Union Note" dark plate returned to 1 yuan cheaper, at 103 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Market Without Major Fluctuations, Only 14 Yuan Rise and Fall in Half a Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash raw gold dark market situation continued to hover, and the changes can be said to be extremely small. It first rose and then fell back, resulting in a slightly higher price than the previous day. This was caused by the Hong Kong gang's search for bargains. The morning opening was 4,785 yuan, up 9 yuan, due to the US dollar exchange rate tightening and a certain silver shop buying on behalf of the Hong Kong gang. Then, a certain money exchange industry followed, and the price rose another 5 yuan to 4,790 yuan. Later, a certain broker sold on behalf of the Dalian gang, and a certain silver firm also sold. At that time, the foreign exchange slightly turned firm, so it was difficult to stand firm. The price once fell to 4,776 yuan. However, the Hong Kong gang came back to operate when the price was low, so the closing price was still 4,780 yuan, which was 4 yuan better than the previous day. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday, and there was also little trading heard outside the market. The turnover in half a day was about 1,000 taels. The silver shop's jewelry gold was fixed, and the customs gold, etc., were still flat. Since the beginning of the morning, the initial opening price per bar (10 taels) was raised by 9 yuan due to the tight US dollar exchange rate and the first purchase by the Hong Kong gang. A certain silver shop entered 50 taels of silver firm, at 4,785 yuan. After a while, a certain money exchange industry also came to follow up, so the price was raised by another 5 yuan. The money exchange industry entered 50 taels of gold firm, at 4,790 yuan. Afterwards, because a certain broker suddenly issued a sell order, and the US dollar exchange rate slightly returned firm, while the British gold was reported to be slightly looser, a certain silver firm and securities report, etc., also mutually sold out. The Hong Kong gang's appetite turned dull, and Shanghai took a step back. A certain money firm exited 10 taels to the money exchange industry, losing to 4,776 yuan. Since then, sellers have gradually decreased, and the Hong Kong gang has come back to absorb at a low price, pulling up 8 yuan again. A certain silver firm entered 50 taels of securities firm, at 4,784 yuan. In the end, because the Hong Kong gang's appetite was sufficient, the silver shop gang and a certain silver firm, etc., came back to sell, and then fell back by 4 yuan. A certain silver firm exited 30 taels to the money exchange industry, with the closing price at 4,780 yuan. As a result, the closing price was 4 yuan higher than the previous day. In half a day, it only rose and fell by 4 yuan. The selling price of the cash firm's own brand of gold was several yuan higher than the raw gold, and the purchase was reduced by about 20 yuan. The current cash price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Still Not Changed</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael in silver shops continued to be stable. Datonghang still quoted 485 yuan. The new same firm's price was the same as the previous price, and the purchase was reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Sales Turned Tight</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds, had little supply and demand, and the market was stable. The trading of British and American gold notes was not prosperous. The British gold notes were still 55 yuan. The US gold notes were slightly tighter due to the rapid decline in the pound exchange rate. The evening market was 14.65 yuan. The Hong Kong notes were slightly soft. The demand for Singapore notes and Dutch notes increased. The Philippine notes also trended firm. The Japanese yen notes were slightly weak, and the evening market was 1.294 yuan. The Korean notes were slightly weak, and the evening market was 1.013 yuan. Yesterday's market price: US gold notes rose by 2 points, Hong Kong notes fell by 5 li, French franc notes rose by 1 li, Singapore notes, Dutch notes, and Philippine notes all rose by 5 points, Annam notes rose by 2 points, and other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Securities: Foreign Stocks Steady, Domestic Bonds Hover</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the unofficial market situation for the Consolidated Public Bonds was such that, due to the recent tightening of credit and the burden of interest on margin and collateral for buyers, progress was slow. Although the bears constantly relied on rumors from Nanjing to secretly dump stocks, the general understanding of the futility of rumors and scattered small purchases meant that the bulls felt quite energetic, resulting in a balance between buying and selling. This created a slight ripple effect, with the daily fluctuations being minimal, only ranging between one or two jiao. Only the Category B bonds saw a deduction of eight jiao due to the drawing of winning numbers. Other bonds fluctuated between five fen and one jiao. The trading volume did not increase, remaining at around 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 50 shares of Sanyo Industry Company were traded at a price of 13.50 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market at the Public Brokers' Association continued to be stable at the opening. Although there were some bulls who came out to close positions due to the weekend, the buying side was very absorbent, and trading increased significantly as a result. Purchase orders came in steadily, and prices gradually increased. Shanghai Bank, Union Insurance, Jardine Matheson, Steel Industry, and Jardine Matheson were the most actively traded, with prices showing progress. Rubber stocks were stable.</p>
<p>London, 8th (Friday) Dispatch: Today's listed prices for Far Eastern companies' stocks on the London Stock Exchange showed an overall increase. Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's UK-registered shares rose by £1.5, priced at £93.5. The Hong Kong-registered shares followed suit, rising by £0.5, priced at £92.5. Mercantile Bank shares rose by 2 shillings and 6 pence to £12 12s 6d. Kaiping Mines shares continued to rise by 3 pence, priced at 18s 6d. Kulala Klang Rubber shares slightly fell by 1.5 pence, to 21s 10.5d. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>London, 8th (Friday) Dispatch: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt fluctuated slightly, with mixed gains and losses. The Anglo-German Continued Loan (British issue) rose by £2, to £59. The Sino-French American Dollar (with stamp) slightly increased by £0.5, priced at £51.5. The Tianjin-Pukou Railway Original Continued Loans both fell by £0.5, priced at £13. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn &amp; Cotton: The Foundation of Cotton Yarn Should Not Be Underestimated, New Sellers Are Not Lacking When Prices Rise</h3>
<p>The yarn market is firm and resilient, with a stable trend, but the range of fluctuations is very narrow. This is due to the stability of both domestic and foreign exchange rates, which has calmed people's minds. At the same time, although there has been no large-scale development in actual sales, the Hong Kong firms are continuously making small, sporadic purchases. The major traders have already cleared the fixed amount of 20-count Double Horse yarn for March. According to their intentions, there is no hope for the price of raw materials to fall in the short term. However, because the bears believe that the foundation cannot be considered small, new sellers are not lacking when prices rise.</p>
<p>The opening atmosphere for spot yarn this morning was unremarkable. Shortly after, news of a decline in foreign exchange rates stimulated buying interest. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse for March was 912 yuan, which rose directly to 14 yuan. At this time, buyers were still numerous, but the guest firms sold a little, so prices remained high for a long time. By the time the market closed, prices had risen again. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 2,045 bales were traded. Spot prices for 20-count Double Horse rose by three to four yuan. Today, 50 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, and 177 pieces were shipped to Xiamen. The amount of yarn purchased by each firm is recorded below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 275, Fellow Traders: 1,700</p>
<p>Inland: 45, Sichuan: 20</p>
<p>Xiamen: 5, Total: 2,045</p>
<h3>Domestic Cotton Is Scarce, Difficult to Develop, Traders Shift Focus to Indian Cotton</h3>
<p>The trading of domestic cotton has become less active, but market sentiment remains firm as ever. The reason for the decline in business is said to be that holders are unwilling to sell. Also, due to the weekend, transactions have decreased. Recently, various cotton firms, seeing the scarcity of goods and the difficulty in developing domestic cotton, have been actively purchasing Indian cotton from overseas. It is said that the number of purchases is increasing day by day. The current situation of spot cotton transactions is listed below:</p>
<p>In other news, the price of foreign cotton: the New York cotton market was particularly quiet yesterday. Also, due to the short selling by Southern firms and the overseas cotton merchants in the market, the closing price of the cotton market yesterday fell by six to seven points for near-term contracts and three points for long-term contracts compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market has been quiet in recent days due to the strike by yarn mills. In addition, many bulls have closed their positions, and the market is quite sluggish. Yesterday, brokers predicted a sharp drop of more than six rupees, and more than ten pounds for Egyptian cotton.</p>
<p>The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai was quieter yesterday. Traders suddenly refrained from buying Indian cotton due to fears of further price declines in India. The factories have remained lukewarm, likely due to the heavy arrival of goods in recent days. The price for cotton delivered to factories yesterday, converted at an exchange rate of 6.71875 yuan for US dollars, is as follows:</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Guest Sales of Cotton Cloth Are Lively Again</h3>
<p>The cloth market is ostensibly slack but actually tight. Although the bulls are finding it difficult to maintain their positions due to tight credit and difficulties in storage, the general attitude of goods holders remains calm. The manufacturers are quoting surprisingly high prices due to the increasing cost of production. The wholesalers' appetites seem to have been satisfied, and there is more trading in and out. The street firms and guest firms, such as those selling to the southwest, Yunnan, Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, and East, have all made progress, but the excessive inventory in the market has affected the market to a certain extent. The rise and fall of each commodity varies. Due to the gradual restoration of inland transportation in Ningbo, nearly 200 pieces of fine twill, fine cloth, and group cloth were purchased yesterday. The Fujian and Guangdong firms purchased more than one hundred pieces of poplin, printed cloth, bleached cloth, and colored cloth. The Yunnan firms purchased more than one hundred boxes of colored cloth and woolen fabric. The Northern Anhui firms purchased more than 5,000 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, and printed cloth. The Nanyang firms purchased more than 4,000 pieces. The street firms traded more than 500 pieces.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices See Mixed Gains and Losses</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Taikoo Sugar Company quoted a price of 5.975 Dutch guilders for crude white sugar, according to the C.L.F.IC standard price, which was slightly lower than before. It also quoted 14.90 Hong Kong dollars for 3,500 bags of B-Mark granulated sugar. The market prices set by the local association showed mixed gains and losses. Spot prices for second-grade crude white sugar were up slightly, two to three jiao, at 62.20 yuan at local firms, 62 yuan for newly arrived goods at foreign firms, and 61.80 to 61.60 yuan for old goods. Re-exported goods were up slightly, five jiao, at 48.50 yuan. Taikoo granulated sugar was up slightly, three to five jiao, with B-Mark at Western firms at 66.50 yuan, CW-Mark at 66 yuan, CX-Mark at 64.50 yuan, DY-Mark at 63.80 yuan, and HX-Mark at 63.50 yuan. Eastern firms' goods were down five jiao to two jiao and three jiao. H-Mark crude sugar saw a similar decrease, at 44.50 to 44 yuan. Dutch crude sugar rose by four to five jiao, with MP-Mark at 47.50 yuan and WA-Mark at 46.90 yuan. There were no changes in local white sugar and No. 1 crystal sugar. The Jian Firm offered more than 400 bags of new Diaoging sugar at 49 to 48.50 yuan, up by one yuan. The Xinghua Firm offered another batch of sheet Qing sugar, boxed at 43 yuan and basketed at 42.50 yuan, both up by several jiao.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Tangerine Cakes Rise One Yuan</h3>
<p>The bridge cakes, after a batch recently arrived via the Jinan freighter, have seen activity as the goods are selling quickly. The market has become tight, and the price was raised by one yuan from yesterday. The price of particularly high-quality goods is expected to continue to rise. Lotus seeds: twenty-five boxes arrived from Ningbo yesterday.</p>

<h3>The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Shanghai International Settlement Strenuously Opposes the Municipal Council's Tax Increase; Comparisons with Foreign Cities Will Inevitably Lead to Market Disruption and Disastrous Consequences</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, citing increased expenditure, plans to increase the municipal general rate, special house rate, and land rate surcharge by 50% from July 1st of this year. After the news was made public, residents within the Settlement were panic-stricken. The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Shanghai International Settlement sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, urging them to reconsider. The original letter is recorded below:</p>
<p>Citizens Are Panic-Stricken</p>
<p>"To the esteemed Council, since your Council announced the 50% tax increase, public opinion has been uneasy. We have received a letter from the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, which stated that the district branches of this association, namely the 27th, 11th, 2nd, 26th, 12th, 24th, 35th, and 34th districts, have reported that they have recently learned that the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, citing increased expenditure, plans to increase the municipal general rate, special house rate, and land rate surcharge by 50% from July 1st of this year to compensate for the increase. The news has spread, and residents within the Settlement are panic-stricken. Since the outbreak of the war, the population of this city has concentrated, and the prices of all goods have soared. Although the various industrial and commercial sectors appear to be prosperous on the surface, in reality, this prosperity is entirely due to consumption and cannot last. Most of the citizens are from the war zones, and after nearly three years, their economic capacity has gradually withered. At a time when prices are skyrocketing, their lives are already under severe threat. Therefore, speaking of tax increases at this time will further deepen the market crisis. If the Municipal Council argues that the market has improved, and most salaried workers have increased their salaries or subsidies, then this salary increase is merely a drop in the bucket and cannot offset the expenditure caused by the high cost of goods. Therefore, this association sincerely hopes that the Municipal Council will abandon the tax increase at this time of economic hardship and propose a remedy, paying attention to thrift in order to balance revenue and expenditure. We are sending this letter to your Council, requesting that you, together with the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, forward it to the Municipal Council for strict negotiation and prevention, so that the tax increase does not become a reality. Then the citizens will be fortunate, the market will be fortunate, and so on. Received at the meeting, based on this.</p>
<p>Public Opinion Is in an Uproar</p>
<p>Since the Municipal Council announced its intention to increase the tax rate by 50% from July 1st of this year, public opinion, both Chinese and foreign, has been in an uproar. They all believe that this move by the Municipal Council will further deepen the market crisis. At this time, the Municipal Council should share the hardships with the taxpayers, reducing the municipal expenditure to the lowest possible level, eliminating unnecessary expenditures as much as possible, and respecting the taxpayers' hard-earned money. It is still remembered that before the war, the Municipal Council planned to increase the tax rate by 2% (from 14% to 16%), and all sectors unanimously protested, saying that they could not bear the burden, and the implementation was eventually postponed. Now, during the war, when prices are abnormal and people's livelihoods are difficult, the sudden desire to increase the tax rate by 50% is truly extracting marrow from bones. Once implemented, it will stimulate prices to continue to soar, and rent disputes will also evolve, plunging society into serious unrest. We hope that you will quickly negotiate a halt, and we will be eternally grateful. Received at the meeting.</p>
<p>Swiftly Halt It</p>
<p>Everyone knows that balancing the budget has two main aspects: (1) thrift and (2) opening up new sources of revenue, which is the old saying of "increasing income and reducing expenditure." However, if your Council compares Shanghai to foreign cities and uses this concept to manage the municipal economy of the International Settlement, it will inevitably destroy the balance on one hand while striving to achieve balance on the other. As a result, it will merely be a temporary solution and not a fundamental cure, and it will ultimately lead to the consequences that this association has repeatedly stated. In accordance with the aforementioned letter, we are hereby informing you, hoping that you will investigate and immediately stop before it is too late, avoiding a descent into a deep abyss. We sincerely hope for your friendship. This is addressed to the Chief Executive of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Arrives in Shanghai Daily, Rice Prices Fall Accordingly; Saigon Rice Prices Decrease, Shanghai Market Follows a Downward Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday, another 14,244 bags of foreign rice were imported by the Jardine Matheson's Yisheng vessel, loaded with 6,656 bags from Haiphong and transported 7,588 bags from Hong Kong. They were imported at dawn yesterday, stopping at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. The Java Mail Steamship Company's Oberlin vessel, managed by the manager, loaded with over 71,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, but had not been imported by the evening. According to the company, the vessel should arrive today and still moor at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou for unloading.</p>
<p>Population Decrease</p>
<p>Since the news that the subsidized rice sales will be discontinued next month spread, the public has been quite concerned about the source and price of food in the future. Rice industry insiders said that rice prices are likely to continue to fall in the future. In the past, 80% of the source was the domestic rice and 20% to 30% was the imported rice. It was quite difficult to order the imported rice at that time, which formed an open secret, and the source of domestic rice was restricted and not smooth, which led to the opportunity of manipulation and hoarding. However, now the opposite is true: 70% to 80% rely on ordering the foreign rice and only 20% to 30% hope to obtain the domestic rice. In addition, the price of ordering the rice from Saigon depends entirely on the rise and fall of the foreign exchange rate, which has become a completely open transaction. Anyone can order from foreign countries, unlike the secret transactions in the past, and hoarders are also selling their goods, to a certain extent, because of this. Secondly, Shanghai's middle and lower classes find it difficult to live in the city, and many have moved back to their hometowns due to difficulties in maintaining their livelihoods.</p>
<p>Price Drop in Production Areas</p>
<p>The daily food consumption of the entire city is 80% or even 70% of what it used to be. With these two reasons, the future price drop in rice is expected. Moreover, Saigon, the production area of foreign rice, has abundant production and lower prices. The price of foreign rice in the wooden market has also been lowered. Yesterday, the average price of rice per dan fell by about one yuan.</p>
<h3>British Royal Air Force Hosts a Banquet for Whitehead; Whitehead Is the Newly Appointed Military Attaché of the British Embassy</h3>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Whitehead, the newly appointed military attaché of the British Embassy, attended a weekly banquet of the British Royal Air Force on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. The Royal Air Force held a banquet on the 7th to welcome Colonel Whitehead and show their welcome, as there had been no gathering since Colonel Whitehead's appointment. Colonel Whitehead came to China in 1913, returned to his country to participate in World War I, came to Tianjin in northern China in 1928, and was later transferred to Beiping. In 1934, he was transferred to Singapore and Hong Kong, and recently transferred to his current position.</p>
<h3>After the Establishment of the New Sino-American Loan, the Legal Tender Becomes More Stable; Although the Japanese Side Expresses Extreme Dissatisfaction, They Do Not Dare to Offend the United States</h3>
<p>After the news of the establishment of the Sino-American 20 million yuan credit loan spread, the financial market in Shanghai yesterday became more stable. According to a mogul of a foreign bank, this credit loan is a designated amount for China to use to purchase heavy trucks and railway materials in the United States, not to lend cash, so there will be no waves in the market. However, in terms of actively assisting China, its significance is very important. The Chinese legal tender has been quite stable in the foreign exchange market for the past three days. Even if there are fluctuations, they are only slight changes. Yesterday, the buying price of the US dollar was 14.54 yuan, and the selling price was 14.95 yuan. The buying price of the British pound was 56.47 yuan per pound, and the selling price was 58.18 yuan.</p>
<p>Although the Japanese Are Disappointed, There Is Nothing They Can Do</p>
<p>The China Press said that at yesterday's (8th) press conference hosted by the Japanese side, when a reporter asked the spokesman of the Japanese Embassy about the impact of the US government's loan to China on the Sino-Japanese situation, the reply was that a large-scale war is currently taking place in China,</p>
<p>Any economic or spiritual assistance given to Chongqing</p>
<p>Cannot be regarded as a friendly act towards Japan. However, the scope of assistance provided by the United States and the specific results of the assistance to the Chongqing government are questionable. Furthermore, this loan has been declared that it is not intended to purchase military equipment and ordnance, so Chongqing has little use for this loan. The American public seems to have</p>
<p>The Same Perspective</p>
<p>As the trend of China and Finland, which is a misunderstanding of the facts. When asked whether the loan will stimulate the emotions between the Japanese and Americans in China, the spokesperson replied that he could not imagine that the loan would have a good impact on the relationship between the American and Japanese people. The Japanese government's determination to successfully end the war in China and readjust</p>
<p>American-Japanese Relations</p>
<p>Is very firm. He believes that in the future, it will eventually show the sincerity of the Japanese people and the government. Those who pay attention to the overall situation in the Far East have known the determination of the Japanese side. When asked, "Since the American-Japanese Commercial Treaty of 1911 has been abolished, and now the loan is granted to China, will this encourage automatic</p>
<p>Anti-American Sentiment</p>
<p>In China?", the spokesperson replied that it is currently difficult to imagine the outbreak of this sentiment, but he cannot predict what kind of events future changes and situations will promote. The actions of all governments are governed by circumstances, and so is Japan. In the future, the Japanese people's feelings towards the United States may be angered by events that occur in the future, but it goes without saying that the Japanese authorities do not want the relations between the United States and Japan to deteriorate.</p>
<h3>Salvaging the Sunken Jing Sheng Steamer, Bodies Recovered</h3>
<p>After the Jing Sheng lighter sank off Ningbo, nine days have passed. The aftermath committee once tried to salvage the vessel, but was unable to lift it due to its excessive weight. According to a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency who inquired with the shipping department of the Moufu Steamer Company, ten divers from Shanghai arrived in Ningbo on the morning of the day before yesterday, and began salvage operations at 1:00 PM. After the divers surveyed the vessel, it was determined that it was not easy to lift the vessel out of the water due to the presence of bodies inside, which added to its weight. Therefore, it was decided to first salvage the bodies inside the vessel. Three female bodies and one male and one child's body were immediately recovered. The salvage operations were stopped at 3:00 PM due to the strong currents. When the tide receded at 8:00 PM, the salvage operations were continued, and were stopped at 10:30 PM. One more body was recovered at that time. The third salvage operation was conducted at 8:00 AM yesterday, and it is planned to completely recover the bodies inside the vessel before attempting to salvage the vessel. However, the currents are rapid at that location, and it is necessary to wait for the tide to recede before entering the water for salvage operations. Therefore, the salvage operations cannot be completed in a short period of time. The Ningbo Shanghai Association is very concerned about the distressed passengers. In addition to allocating 10,000 yuan from the Ningbo disaster relief funds, the Association also notified Shanghai natives yesterday to solicit donations for the Jing Sheng steamer to handle the aftermath for the distressed passengers. According to another source, salvaging the sunken vessel is not difficult, but it is necessary to find a way to enter the water and seal off the vessel on all sides, pump out the water inside the vessel, and then it can float. However, the necessary equipment for salvaging the vessel has not been completed, and the salvage operations cannot be carried out.</p>
<h3>The First Hospital of the Relief Association to Celebrate Its Anniversary Today</h3>
<p>For the sake of improving the health of refugees, Yu Qiaqing, chairman of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, and others raised a large sum of money to establish a civilian hospital. For one year, it has benefited society to a great extent. It is heard that the First Hospital of the Association, located at No. 140, North Xizang Road, has been established for one year since its establishment last year. A week of anniversary celebration will be held at the hospital today, inviting people from all walks of life to visit.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Chairmanship Election; Allman Agrees to Participate; British and American Candidates Have Been Fully Launched</h3>
<p>According to someone close to the famous American lawyer Mr. Allman, Mr. Allman has decided to accept the candidacy for the chairmanship of the Municipal Council as proposed by friends. However, the American community must first hold a primary election before the Municipal Council election, and decide on two people from among the three candidates to be the formal candidates.</p>
<p>The China Press said that the election for the chairmanship of the Public Concession Municipal Council is approaching, and the preparations for the primary election of candidates by the expatriates of various countries in Shanghai have been completed. The British Electoral Committee announced yesterday (8th) the names of the seven British candidates as follows: Keswick, Hayley, McGill, Powell, Lottrik McDonald, Lanar McDonald, and Lightell. An election will be held within the next fourteen days to elect five of them. The Municipal Council chairmanship election will be held on April 10th and 11th.</p>

<h3>The British Vessel Hunan, Which Was Shelled by Japanese Warships, Has Arrived in Shanghai; British Authorities Say the Japanese Side Has Apologized; However, It Has Caused Great Anxiety Among the People of Shanghai</h3>
<p>The China Press said that the Taikoo Shipping Company's vessel Hunan, which was shelled by warships last month, arrived in Shanghai yesterday (8th). Captain White Ross has reported the details of the shelling to the British Embassy Office and the Taikoo Shipping Company in this city. According to authorities here, the matter has been concluded, as Japanese officials have apologized at the location of the incident and promised to compensate for the damage. Therefore, the diplomatic community will not continue to negotiate.</p>
<p>A Small Dent in the Rear Deck</p>
<p>The damage to the Hunan vessel was very minor, with only a small dent in the rear deck, indicating the location where the shell landed. A solid steel shell was found on the deck and handed over to British Embassy officials.</p>
<p>Once Caused Great Anxiety</p>
<p>The crew of the vessel were quite surprised to hear that the matter had agitated people in Shanghai when they arrived in Shanghai. It is said that the family members of the crew and passengers, after reading the brief messages about the vessel being shelled on the London Broadcasting Corporation and in the newspapers in this city, rushed to the Taikoo Shipping Company's office to inquire about the condition of the vessel. At that time, the only news that the Taikoo Shipping Company could release was "Everyone on board is safe."</p>
<p>The Wife of a Crew Member Mistakenly Thought It Had Sunk</p>
<p>However, the wife of a certain crew member thought that this statement had an undertone, and said that the vessel may have sunk and everyone on board was forced to escape by boat. According to the intention of many people in this city yesterday, if the authorities concerned had released more detailed information about the incident, there would not have been rumors and speculation, and the family members of the crew and passengers would not have had to worry. Therefore, it seems inappropriate to keep secrets.</p>
<p>Japan Apologized Immediately After Being Hit</p>
<p>It is learned that this matter occurred at about 11:00 AM on January 27th outside Yantai. The Hunan vessel did not pay attention to the first warning whistle issued by the Japanese warship, as it was thought that the Japanese warship was intercepting other ships. However, it immediately stopped and reported its name and nationality to the Japanese warship in detail. A few minutes later, when the two ships were sailing forward, a shell suddenly hit the deck of the Hunan vessel. According to Taikoo Shipping Company, after the Hunan vessel was hit, Japanese officials left the ship by boat and approached to personally apologize.</p>
<p>Several Passengers Were Almost Hit</p>
<p>However, according to a crew member of the vessel who told reporters yesterday, after the Hunan vessel was hit, it continued to sail forward, and the Japanese warship immediately reported to the Japanese authorities, and the Japanese authorities directly apologized to the officials of the British Embassy here, without notifying the Hunan vessel. The vessel had just left Tianjin and had not reported the matter to the British authorities in Tianjin. It is heard that the shell fired by the Japanese warship was sometimes used for anti-aircraft guns. It fell on the deck of the Hunan vessel without penetrating it. Public opinion is that the shell was fired by a certain junior officer of the Japanese navy. At that time, the vessel was carrying 200 passengers, including four Europeans. Several passengers were on the deck when the shell fell and were almost hit.</p>
<h3>The Chinese 45th Brigade Arrives at Tianmashan, Defending the Foothills as a Base</h3>
<p>According to people from Qingpu, the regular Chinese army's 45th Brigade, led by Tian Xiushan, after defeating more than 100 soldiers of the Japanese army's Shimada unit from Qingpu city in a surprise attack in Zhangliantang last winter, has advanced again to the foothills of Tianmashan, a perfect location for troops to camp. It is said that Tian's troops have been operating in the suburbs of Qingpu for two years. Last year, they attacked the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Fengjing train station and destroyed its two large bridges, cutting off train traffic on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. They also fought fiercely with the Japanese army and air force in the Xitang-Taozhuang area for many days. At one point, they were forced to retreat west of the Sujia Road due to being outnumbered and outgunned by the Japanese soldiers. After receiving sufficient supplies from the military authorities, they advanced rapidly northeast along the Jiangsu-Zhejiang border. Their marching was miraculous. When they developed a new base on the shores of the Yeshe Marsh and in Zhangliantang Town last winter, they were discovered by the Japanese army in Qingpu, who sent troops to resist. Tian's troops surrounded the Japanese army using a new strategic flexibility, capturing more than 70 soldiers. They charged straight to the peaks of Tianmashan. The Japanese side was thinly manned and dared not attack.</p>
<h3>Gauss Will Be Sworn In in Shanghai; Order to Go to Australia Has Not Yet Arrived; U.S. State Department Is Expediting</h3>
<p>The China Press said that the official of the U.S. Consulate told reporters yesterday (8th) that the departure date of U.S. Consul General in Shanghai Gauss to take up his new post as U.S. Minister to Australia in Canberra has been delayed. Two months ago, it was expected that Gauss would be on his way to Australia at this time, but Gauss has not yet received instructions from the State Department to leave Shanghai. Although there is no special reason for the slight delay in instructions, it is clear that the preparation by Washington for Gauss's departure from Shanghai has taken longer than expected in this city. It is heard that the current U.S. Consul General in Beiping, Lockhart, is the strongest candidate to succeed Gauss as U.S. Consul General in this city. Mr. Lockhart has stayed in Shanghai several times and has the necessary experience in Far Eastern affairs. Gauss is still handling the duties of Consul General. After the instructions from Washington arrive in Shanghai, Mr. Gauss may hold the swearing-in ceremony for his position as Minister at the U.S. Consulate General in this city.</p>
<h3>Hungarian Community Prepares to Celebrate National Day</h3>
<p>The Hungarian community in this city will hold a grand gathering on the 15th to celebrate their country's National Day. This year, the Hungarian people attach even greater importance to this festival because it marks the 500th anniversary of the birth of King Matthias and the 20th anniversary of the election of Horthy as Regent of Hungary. The celebration program is as follows: At 8:30 am, Hungarian expatriates will gather at the Pushi Road Church for a celebration ceremony. At 9:00 pm, a concert will be held at the American Women's Club. All proceeds from ticket sales will go to the Hungarian Relief Association.</p>
<p>Note: The Republic of Hungary was established on November 23, 1918, with Mr. Károlyi as its first president. On March 22 of the following year, a so-called Bolshevik government was established, but it was immediately overthrown by Romania. On March 23, 1920, Hungary officially established a new government and elected Horthy as regent.</p>
<h3>Residents Outside the Settlement Refuse to Pay Municipal Taxes; Water Supply Cut Off; Tax Payment Issue Not Included in Agreement; Fessenden Refuses to Comment on the Matter</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily News, incidents have occurred in the area outside the Settlement where roads were built, in which residents refused to pay municipal taxes, leading to the cutoff of their water supply. Yesterday (the 8th), the reporter asked Mr. Fessenden, the Secretary-General and Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, about this matter, and asked whether the water cutoff situation in the area had become more prevalent in the past two months. Mr. Fessenden replied that he could not comment on this issue. As for whether some residents in the area refused to pay taxes to the Municipal Council because they had already paid taxes to the "Shanghai Municipal Government," he also could not say. The issue of tax payment in the area outside the Settlement where roads were built was not included in the agreement recently reached between the Municipal Council and the "Municipal Government." The reporter asked whether the tax issue would be resolved outside the scope of the agreement, and Mr. Fessenden said that he could not comment on this point either. However, he could inform the reporter that the Municipal Council and the "Shanghai Municipal Government" were currently conducting "verbal discussions" regarding the water cutoff incidents involving residents of the extremely small Non-Fei Road Meicun Lane and Sancheng Lane (both transliterated) due to their failure to pay municipal taxes.</p>

<h3>Promulgation of General Occupational Licenses in the French Concession; All Profit-Making Occupations Must Obtain Licenses; Salaried Employees Exempt</h3>
<p>According to Da Guang News Agency, after the promulgation of the regulations for general occupational licenses in the French Concession, many people in various circles have not understood the true situation. Therefore, it is explained that all those who engage in occupations for their own profit within the concession must obtain these licenses. However, charitable undertakings and undertakings that promote the knowledge and morality of others (such as educational and cultural institutions, scientific research, universities, artists, sanatoriums, and hospitals) are exempt from licensing.

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Budget for This Year</h3>
<p>—Music Team</p>
<p>The draft budget for the Shanghai Municipal Council Music Team for this year has been submitted to the Music Committee, which met on February 15 to review it. The total budget is 236,130 yuan, which is 49,770 yuan more than last year. Except for the "travel expenses" item, which is 1,270 yuan less than last year, all other items are more than last year. "Salaries and allowances" increased by 55,600 yuan, "medicines, transportation, water, electricity, and fuel" increased by 4,230 yuan, "advertising, printing, and stationery" increased by 2,500 yuan, "new sheet music" increased by 1,100 yuan, "instrument repairs" increased by 3,000 yuan, and "maintenance and repairs" increased by 1,340 yuan, totaling an increase of 67,770 yuan. After deducting the amount to be audited and the estimated increase in income this year, the net increase is 49,770 yuan. The reasons for the increase in various expenditures are roughly similar to the situation everywhere.</p>
<p>The team's income for this year includes the following items: (1) Grant from the French Municipal Council: 20,100 yuan; (2) Grant from the French authorities: 20,000 yuan; (3) Grant from the Italian government: 20,690 yuan; (4) Fees for private services: 150 yuan; (5) Concert ticket revenue: 9-1,300 yuan.</p>
<p>The total budget for the team this year is 36,1210 yuan, exceeding the per capita annual limit (200,000 yuan) for the chief accountant. Therefore, the finance director proposed using the team's reserve fund and appropriately increasing the price of concert tickets to make up for the shortfall.</p>
<p>The committee members have agreed to increase ticket prices, but the implementation date will be at the beginning of this year's summer concerts.</p>
<p>Regarding the fees for privately hiring the band, the committee members unanimously agreed that the current fees were too low and should be appropriately increased. It was then decided that (1) a surcharge of 50% should be added to all fees for privately hiring the band, as well as for transporting instruments and vehicles; (2) the free practice session should be canceled immediately. From now on, fees should be charged at half the rate of the full fee schedule for formal performances.</p>
<p>To reduce the budget for this year, the team's reserve fund will not be fully used, and the reserve fund that can be obtained from this year's budget will also be transferred for use.</p>
<p>Finally, the committee members resolved that the music team's budget for this year should be revised to within the limit of 200,000 yuan and submitted to the Finance Committee for review.</p>

<h3>Conte Rosso Arrives in Shanghai from Europe; Speed Increased En Route; Carrying a Large Number of Passengers</h3>
<p>The Conte Rosso, a special express liner of the Italian National Steamship Company's Europe-Asia line, departed from Conis on the 9th of last month to come to the Far East. It was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 7th of this month. A few days ago, due to heavy fog at sea, the ship was affected by heavy fog on the way from Little Luzon to Hong Kong, which reduced the rate. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong on the 5th, but was delayed until the 6th. It left Hong Kong at 6 pm that afternoon and headed north, and was expected to arrive in the port yesterday morning. All circumstances have been reported previously. It is now known that the ship saw clear seas on the way from Hong Kong to Shanghai, and the shipowner ordered an increase in speed. Therefore, it entered Wusongkou at 3:30 pm the day before yesterday and docked at the Hongkou Gonghexiang Wharf at 5:30 pm. There were a total of 935 passengers, including more than 400 Chinese crew members returning from Germany and more than 100 Jews. They were transferred in batches to small steamships to disembark at the New Customs Wharf. The mail ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai and return to Europe tomorrow morning at 8 am. Because it arrived late, it will also be changed to depart from the pier and export at 8 am on the 11th to return to Venice. Passengers are scheduled to go to the New Customs Wharf at 9 pm tonight to take the company's prepared passenger shuttle boat to the big ship. The Java Mail Ship Company's Cibadak Mail Ship, which came to Shanghai from Surabaya this time, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 11th. Now it is said that it will be delayed by one day and arrive on the 12th.</p>
<h3>Tragic Incident on Avenue Albert Yesterday; Weng Guangtian Stabbed to Death; Died of Three Stab Wounds; Two Assailants Fled Without a Trace</h3>
<p>A stabbing murder occurred on Avenue Albert in the French Concession at around 9:00 am yesterday. The victim was Weng Guangda from Ningbo, the deputy manager of the Ningshao Fire and Marine Insurance Company in this port. He was stabbed in the head, back of the head, right face, and back, etc., bleeding profusely. The two assailants abandoned their knives and fled. The injured man was sent to the hospital for treatment but died in the afternoon. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Employed by Ningshao for Three Years</p>
<p>Weng Guangtian from Ningbo, 42 years old, has been the deputy manager of the Ningshao Fire and Marine Insurance Company and the Ningshao Shipping Company on the third floor of Jianhua Bank, No. 86 Jiangxi Road and Ningbo Road, for more than three years. His wife, Zhu Caijun (41 years old), currently lives in his hometown, while Weng lives at the above address with his concubine, Jiang Wenying (32 years old, from Ningbo). His son, Weng Kainian, is 24 years old and is currently studying in the political science department of Fudan University.</p>
<p>Suddenly Attacked on the Way to Work Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Weng lived at No. 18 Baolongfang, Avenue Albert, in the French Concession. At around 9:10 am yesterday morning, Weng was dressed in Chinese clothing and took his own chartered car as usual. The driver, Yuan Weizheng (alias A Si, 26 years old) from Jiangbei, drove him to the company to work. Unexpectedly, before he had gone a few steps, in front of Zhao Ji Garment Shop, No. 3 in the lane, two thugs wearing black short coats suddenly appeared. One grabbed the car shaft, and the other showed a sharp triangular pointed knife. Without asking why, they stabbed Weng three times, once in the left back bone, once on the right side of the face below the eye, and once in the back of the head. The wounds were very deep, and blood gushed out. Weng endured the pain and got out of the car, and quickly fled home.</p>
<p>Driver Trapped; Assailants Flee</p>
<p>At this moment, another thug threw a bag of incense ash at the head and eyes of the chartered car driver, Yuan Weizheng. The incense ash powder hit his eyes directly, causing the driver to be unable to open his eyes. The assailants took the opportunity to abandon their knives and flee the lane. By the time the nearby police learned of the incident and arrived, the assailants had long since disappeared.</p>
<p>Died of Three Stab Wounds</p>
<p>Weng fled home and was accompanied by his concubine, Jiang Wenying (22 years old), in a chartered car to the Hongqiao Sanatorium on Avenue Joffre. Because the sanatorium did not have an emergency room, they transferred to the Red Cross Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective, and he died in the hospital at 1:20 pm. Weng's chartered car driver, Yuan Weizheng, along with the recovered murder weapon, were taken back to the police station for strict interrogation.</p>
<p>Previous Lawsuit Due to Discord with Subordinates</p>
<p>Weng had previously had disagreements with employees of the company. In January of this year, all the employees jointly sent a letter to the board of directors attacking Weng very harshly. At that time, Weng reported to the police station, accusing certain employees of the company of defamation. The details were reported in this newspaper. After the court trial, they were declared innocent. The cause of this sudden death is still under investigation.</p>
<h3>Melting Copper Coins for Profit; Three Convicts Sentenced</h3>
<p>Yongtaichang Copper and Tin Shop, No. 825 Beijing Road, is owned by Wu Haitang from Shaoxing and managed by Zhang Bingkun. Recently, seeing that the price of all goods has soared, especially the price of lead, they were blinded by greed and ignored the consequences. They instructed the shop assistants to collect old-fashioned copper coins widely and entrusted the Xiexing Furnace Workshop, No. 8, Lane 140, Xinzha Road, run by Yu Jinsheng and Xu Changlin from Shaoxing, to melt the copper coins for them, at a rate of 18 yuan per dan, and then sell the copper bars at a high price. The matter was discovered by Yang Feizhang, a Chinese detective of the Xinzha Police Station, who went to Xinzha Road and confiscated a large bag of copper coins, totaling 7,800 coins, and 13 copper bars. He then went to Yongtaichang on Beijing Road and arrested the shop assistant Li Guilin and the apprentice Jiang Qingrong, and sent them to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Chuan Lin presided over the Second Criminal Court for a further interrogation. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, requested that Jiang Darong be released first because he was not involved. The other three defendants were prosecuted according to Article 2 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Crimes Against the Currency System. When the defendants were questioned, their confessions were evasive. After verifying the confessions, Judge Chuan sentenced Yu Jinsheng and Xu Changlin to two years of imprisonment each for jointly destroying copper coins, Li Guilin to one year of imprisonment, and Jiang Qingrong was released. The copper coins and other items were confiscated.</p>
<h3>A Pair of Old Lovers Suddenly Quarrel; The Lover Sues for Separation; The Lover is Arrested for Assaulting the Lover</h3>
<p>Zhu Desheng from Ningbo, a former leather craftsman, is 48 years old this year. When he was 21 years old, he met Zhang A Si from Shaoxing, a hairdresser, in Hangzhou. She is 51 years old this year. They have been living together for 27 years. Later, they came to Shanghai to develop, each earning a living through labor, saving money, and jointly opening the Taixing Inn at No. 22 McTaggart Road in the French Concession. The business is quite good. They have already purchased land and built a house in their hometown, hoping to grow old together. Unexpectedly, Zhu Desheng has hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Zhang A Si in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court, seeking a separation. Yesterday afternoon, the court accepted the case and Judge Yu Changzi opened the court for trial. Both parties were represented by lawyers. First, the plaintiff's lawyer stated the reasons for the lawsuit. Then, the defendant's lawyer, Du Xi, said that the two parties have been living together for 27 years and have a contract. Recently, because the plaintiff was satiated and thinking of lewdness, and frolicked in the brothels, quarrels often arose. The defendant originally intended to appear in court today, but unexpectedly the two had another fight this morning, causing the defendant to be injured and arrested and sent to the hospital, so she could not appear in court. The plaintiff's lawsuit should be rejected. After verifying the situation, the court ordered that the case be postponed to the 27th to see if the plaintiff and defendant both appear in court for interrogation. Because the two had a fight yesterday, the police have detained Zhu and will send him to court for interrogation tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Trust Companies to Confer on Open Seal Storage Fees</h3>
<p>The member banks of the Shanghai Banking Association and the Foreign Exchange Banks Association have decided to implement the collection of open seal storage fees starting from the 7th and have jointly sent letters to the Qian industry seeking their opinions. The Qian Industry Association held an executive committee meeting yesterday to discuss this matter. It was resolved that the number of open seal storage businesses handled by various Zhuang (native banks) is not large, so there is no need to establish rules for fee collection. It is heard that among the Qian Zhuang, only Fuyuan Qian Zhuang has storage vaults and safety deposit boxes for rent, while the others only have warehouses and no storage vault facilities. According to inquiries made by a Da Guang News Agency reporter in the financial sector, the Qian industry has decided not to consider the issue of collecting open seal storage fees. However, those currently planning to follow in the footsteps of the Sino-foreign commercial banks are more than twenty trust companies, including Tongyi, Zhongyi, Huanqiu, Shengda, Guoan, Dalu, Shanghai, Zhongwai, Zhongji, Zhongguo, Dongnan, Haian, Tonghai, Huaye, etc. These companies will soon hold a joint meeting to discuss the matter of collecting open seal storage fees, and it is understood that these trust companies handle a large amount of this storage business, so they will definitely decide to implement the fee collection.</p>

<h3>Wedding Ballad</h3>
<p>(Sending Grass Eight Characters) Big Six Clash and Small Six Clash, Year and Geng avoid the same; Ask if your eight characters are true or false, Lying matchmakers waste their hard work.

Wine and food are plentiful to satisfy the old glutton, Deliberately declining and deliberately inviting; Count thirteen and a half from the beginning, Remember to water the plum root decidedly. (Carrying the Offspring Bucket) A load of red chamber pot is carried, Full of happy fruits placed in the middle; Long gown and big hat are very imposing, Not like ordinary laborers.

<h3>The Origin of Arbor Day</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>The annual Arbor Day is coming soon. Do you children know the origin of "Arbor Day"? If you know, that's great, but if you don't, reading this article of mine will tell you.</p>
<p>In the fourth year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce of the Beijing government stipulated that Qingming Day in the lunar calendar should be "Arbor Day." From provincial officials to county magistrates, they must lead their subordinates to the suburbs on this day to plant saplings of phoenix trees, willows, pines, cypresses, etc., with the meaning of "cultivating people and cultivating trees." Other agencies, schools, and organizations across the country also selected parks and other places to plant trees, seeking green shade. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, the National Government was formally established in Nanjing and changed the 12th of March, the anniversary of the death of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the leader of the Kuomintang, to "Arbor Day," on the one hand holding tree planting ceremonies, and on the other hand commemorating the founding father of the Republic of China, to encourage future generations to emulate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit of arduous struggle.</p>
<p>Children! Your fathers and brothers are cultivating you with their blood and sweat, and the nation's national education is nurturing you. You should study harder and work harder. In the crucible of national crisis, temper a strong physique, excellent talent, and a brave spirit, and wait for the completion of the great cause of resistance and national reconstruction. This is what the author earnestly hopes for!</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Childhood</h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>The day after tomorrow (March 12th) is again the anniversary of the death of our national father, Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Schools will be closed for a day as usual. Are the holidays given to you children to give you more opportunities to play? No, this is to call on you to recall all the great achievements made by Mr. Sun Yat-sen during his lifetime, and to use them as a guide for your studies and actions. Let me give an anecdote about Mr. Sun Yat-sen's childhood, which can also leave a deeper impression in your minds.</p>
<p>One day, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, being idle, suddenly thought of a question: "When a person dies, is his life over?" He asked his mother this question. His mother said, "Of course it's over." But Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, "If he can do some earth-shattering things in his lifetime, then even if he dies, is everything over?"</p>
<p>Once, Dr. Sun Yat-sen went to Honolulu with his brother, passing through Macau. Macau at that time was completely different from the isolated island it is today. Everywhere was misleading, with gambling dens and opium dens springing up like mushrooms after rain. For this reason, he advised his brother not to land.</p>
<p>Dr. Sun Yat-sen had already established such ambitions in his childhood, so his later success as a great man and being admired can be said to be a pre-ordained harvest.</p>
<h3>Periscope</h3>
<p>— Jin Zhen</p>
<p>The curtain of the European war has been opened for nearly half a year. Naval battles on the ocean surface are also exceptionally fierce. The warring parties are competitively publicizing their victories in newspapers with news such as "submarines sinking warships" and "destroyers chasing submarines."</p>
<p>"Brother, submarines are lurking in the water, how can they sink other people's warships?" Ah Hui saw this news but knew nothing about the content of submarines, so she asked Ah Ming.</p>
<p>"Although submarines operate in the water, they know everything on the water surface clearly. That is because of their periscope, which protrudes above the water. So the periscope is the eye of the submarine. If it doesn't have it, it is as useless as a blind person. After observing other people's warships through the periscope, they use mathematical principles to measure. The distance between the warship and itself, the angle, the speed of the warship, the tonnage (that is, the size of the ship), etc., are calculated very precisely. Then, they quickly aim at the warship and launch a torpedo of the appropriate size - an underwater bomb. When the torpedo hits the warship's hull, there will be a boom, hitting the vital point, and the warship will slowly sink." Ah Ming explained the situation of the submarine sinking the warship in general.</p>
<p>Ah Hui asked even more inquisitively: "Then how is a periscope constructed?"</p>
<p>"The construction of a periscope is entirely based on the principles of light transmission and reflection in optics. To manufacture a periscope, you only need five pieces of glass - three convex lenses, and when you encounter a triangular prism, it will be refracted and reflected, and after passing through two convex lenses, it will be reflected from the triangular prism again, and then it can be projected into people's eyes. The image seen is exactly the same as the original. If the length of the periscope is longer, that is, the path that the light travels is longer, then the things we see will be smaller, so the glass used must be very accurate, otherwise it may be blurry. The periscope has a certain length, the highest is twenty meters (slightly equal to sixty feet), if it is longer than this limit, the image seen is very small, and it is even more unclear in dark weather. The periscopes used in submarines are more complex and refined, but the essence is the same." Ah Ming went on to say: "We have nothing to do today, let's make a simple periscope ourselves." Ah Hui was of course very happy.</p>
<p>Ah Ming went to find two square pieces of mirror and a piece of corrugated paper. First, he folded the corrugated paper into a square, and then cut the ends into long curved shapes. He painstakingly installed two pieces of mirror on the two corners, but the angle formed by the paper box must be carefully observed so that the light reflected by this piece of mirror must be on the other piece, and the other piece can be reflected from the gap into people's eyes, otherwise it is useless. In less than an hour, the periscope was completed. When playing, as long as you put something near the gap at the top, you can see the same image as that thing in the gap at the bottom. "This toy is so fun!" Everyone in Ah Hui's family was saying this. And Ah Hui also thoroughly understood the principle of the periscope.</p>

<h3>How the Americas Got Their Name</h3>
<p>— Cao Lingyou</p>
<p>Children! When you read world geography, you must know that among the five continents there is the Americas. The Americas are the continents of the Western Hemisphere, bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the west and the Atlantic Ocean to the east, narrow at both ends and with an isthmus in the center, which divides them into North and South America. But I think your geography textbooks rarely tell you how the Americas got their name, so let me tell you here!</p>
<p>As early as 1451, a Spaniard named Amerigo Vespucci was born. When he grew up, he was a beef merchant, and later turned to the shipping business. After several voyages, he accepted the appointment of the King of Portugal to make a long expedition to what is now Brazil. He set out in May 1501 and sailed for three months in the raging ocean before seeing the coast of Brazil. Later, a terrible hurricane sent them to the uninhabited South Georgia Island, which is hundreds of miles east of Cape Horn at the southern tip of South America and was the southernmost place that people had reached at that time. From here, drifting ice floes sent them back to Lisbon, Portugal, in September 1902.</p>
<p>Amerigo was a person with writing talent. He wrote the journey he went through into booklets, strongly stating that the places they passed through were indeed a new continent. He wrote vividly, which aroused the attention of many people and was translated into many languages. These books were passed to Germany. At that time, a young scholar was about to publish a new geography book. He described Amerigo's discovery in the book and suggested calling the place America - meaning the land of Amerigo, to commemorate its discoverer. No one objected to this suggestion, but at first it only referred to the area around Brazil, but later, due to widespread application, the word "America" became the name of the entire South and North America.</p>
<h3>Quotes from Dr. Sun Yat-sen</h3>
<p>Money is not always useful. The most important thing is "loyalty."</p>
<p>Besides revolution, I only like to read. I cannot live without reading for a day.</p>
<p>We aspire to do great things, not to be high officials.</p>
<p>The method of achieving profound learning is not only to learn what the teacher teaches in the classroom every day, but also to infer three corners from one corner and expand it yourself. Outside the classroom, you must pay more attention to self-study. (Recorded from Sun Yat-sen's Stories by Ma Meibo)</p>
<h3>Black Brothers (9)</h3>
<p>— Yimu</p>
<p>Then he continued: "Whoever can climb to the top of the mountain where the Golden River originates and pour three drops of holy water on its source, then for him, only for him, this river will truly become a golden river. But the first time must not fail. After one failure, the second time will not succeed. If someone pours unholy water into the river, then that water will submerge his body and immediately turn him into a black stone." After the King of the Golden River finished speaking, he turned around and strode into the raging fire of the stove; his body turned red, then white, and after a while it became sparkling and transparent, and finally disappeared.</p>
<p>Geller hurriedly rushed over, looked up at the chimney, watched the King of the Golden River evaporate and disappear, and then shouted: "Ga! Ya! Qi Ah, Qi Ah! My pot! My pot! My pot!"</p>
<p>Just as the King of the Golden River disappeared, Siwa and Hans stumbled into the house, drunk and yelling. They saw that the dishes had all turned into nothing, but instead of blaming themselves for their drunkenness and absurdity, they blamed Geller and beat him for a while, for a full quarter of an hour, and then each fell into a chair, asking Geller if he had anything to say. Geller did not dare to neglect, and hurriedly repeated what the King of the Golden River had said. Neither of them believed a word, and they started beating Geller again, until their arms were tired, and then they stopped and went to bed.</p>
<p>The next morning, they suddenly believed Geller's words again, but who of the two should try first became a difficult problem. They argued for a long time, and finally drew their knives to duel each other. The sound of the duel alarmed the neighbors, who hurriedly came to persuade them, but they were unwilling to listen and continued to fight. The neighbors had no choice but to call the police.</p>
<p>As soon as Hans heard that the police were coming, he immediately ran away and hid; but Siwa was arrested by the officials. The judge fined him for disturbing the peace, but he had already drunk all his last money that night and could not pay, so he was sent to prison to be imprisoned until he could come up with the money before he could be released.</p>
<p>Hans was overjoyed when he heard that Siwa had been imprisoned, and decided to rush to the Golden River immediately. How to get holy water was a problem. He went to the pastor to discuss, but the pastor refused to give him holy water because he was a rogue. Hans had no choice but to wait until evening prayer, when he went to participate for the first time, pretending to draw a cross on his chest, stole a cup of holy water, and returned home triumphantly.</p>
<p>Nothing happened overnight. Early the next morning, before the sun had risen, Hans got up. He put the holy water in a bottle, and also carried two bottles of wine and some meat in a basket on his back, and took a climbing stick and went to the mountain.</p>
<p>As he was leaving the village, he passed by the prison and looked at the iron window, and saw Siwa peeking out, his face showing an uneasy expression. Hans smiled coldly and asked, "Good morning, brother, do you have any messages for me to pass on to the King of the Golden River's mother?" Siwa hated him so much that he gnashed his teeth and shook the iron bars on the iron window with all his strength, but they did not move at all. Hans laughed for a while, then carried the basket on his back again and walked away happily.</p>
<h3>The Art of Listening (2)</h3>
<p>Have you ever listened to what your conscience tells you? A person's character can make a sound, and morality also has a sound. Only those who know how to listen can hear it. Conscience is the master. A person's will depends on the sound his conscience makes. Whether one acts righteously or evilly, walks the path of chastity or the path of depravity, his conscience understands everything. If someone does not know whether he is acting righteously, then morally speaking, he must be a fool. Each of our consciences tells us, "This is the way to go, go on!" When we read history, we know that whether in ancient or modern times, whether in China or abroad, those who can achieve great things all come from listening to the words of their conscience. All great scientists, religious figures, philosophers, and politicians are like this. Jesus speaks of the principle of "listening" here to cultivate the art of "listening." We must listen to the voice of conscience. "He who has ears, let him hear." Listen, what a tragic thing it is for a person to make himself deaf in morality! People can survive without sight, hearing, or even smell. Many disabled people in the world are like this, but they cannot survive without a sense of right and wrong. People can see, hear, feel, smell, and use various senses, but without a sense of right and wrong, how strange is that? Doing evil things without feeling pain or having a sense of guilt, such a person can only be counted as a human corpse, not a person. Because his heart is dead. As the saying goes, "If a person has no heart, he dies; if a vegetable has no heart, it turns yellow." How can his life progress? Without progress, of course, he is only considered dead. We must listen to the sound of truth, light, and glory that comes from our inner heart. If we are true to ourselves and do not deceive ourselves, we will understand that this is appropriate. This inner heart is the kingdom of heaven that Jesus said God descended into us. We must listen carefully, and at the same time we must listen carefully to the sounds from outside. It is easy to make the mistake of being deaf to the needs, difficulties, and sorrows of others. We must know that living in the world, only caring about oneself and not being considerate of others, such a life will never be happy. Because humans are social animals, and they are mutually related to each other, they cannot survive alone. Therefore, we listen carefully to the voice of conscience, and at the same time we must listen carefully to the sounds from outside. The Apostle Paul listened to the voice from outside, "Come to Damascus and help us," (To be continued)</p>

<h3>A Record of a Retired Female Tanci Singer: A Little History in the World of Storytelling</h3>
<p>— Dong Yun</p>
<p>"In the world of storytelling, there's a distinction between the 'Su School' and the 'Hai School'. The Su School is called 'Guangyu Society', and the Hai School is called 'Runyu Society'. For thirty years, they were equals, but with deep-seated prejudices! Later, a 'Puyu Society' rose, with both men and women; the members of Guangyu and Runyu societies naturally opposed 'women storytelling', and because of this, the two societies stood on the same 'male storytelling' front, dissolving the past private biases invisibly. This is also a small vicissitude in the world of storytelling, which those who discuss books and specialize in anecdotes in the future must know.</p>
<p>Four or five years ago was the peak of the Puyu Society, but in recent years it has returned from brilliance to plainness! There are several reasons for the failure: First, there were too few talented people in the society; apart from Wang Yanyu's "Pearl Pagoda" and Shen Libin's "Double Phoenix Pearls," there were few books worth listening to. Second, the management of the society was not effective; often there were good venues, but they couldn't be seriously operated; the past "Zhongnan" and "Dazhong" locations were lost in this way. Third, there were too few members, which was insufficient to distribute, making it difficult to seek development. Its strength was not equal to that of Guangyu and Runyu societies; few could be called 'resonating actors', and listening again and again to the same performers inevitably led to boredom! There are many other reasons that cannot be enumerated. If this continues without improvement, the Puyu Society, established through arduous struggle, will eventually be eliminated! When discussing the girls of Puyu, one must first count Zui Yixian and Shen Yuying, and Zhou Xueyan is also a barely satisfactory one, but all three have retreated into seclusion and no longer easily show their beauty to the public!</p>
<p>Zui Yixian's original surname was Jin, and her storytelling skills were passed down from her brother, Ni Chang. A certain gentleman's poem, "Everyone says her brother taught her the wonders, the Jin family's little sister is the most famous," refers to this. She grew up with balanced features and a dignified appearance. Five years ago, she first revealed her beauty in the storytelling circles of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, her braids fluttering, looking like a beauty in a painting. She performed "Double Phoenix Pearls" with her brother, speaking clearly and singing sweetly, captivating not only with her beauty. To be fair, Zui Yixian is beautiful, but in terms of 'charm', she is not as good as Shen Yuying. Shen Yuying's appearance is not absolutely stunning, but she has a kind of endearing demeanor. A smile from Ying Ning generates a hundred charms, her pipa playing is exquisite, unparalleled for a time! Following her father, Libin, in performing "Double Phoenix Pearls", she appeared at the Great World as a "child storyteller" twelve or thirteen years ago, causing a sensation. Her speaking is not as good as Zui Yixian's, but her singing surpasses it. With the pipa hiding her face, her charming smile captivates the city. When she sings softly, she drives countless listeners in the audience mad! Now, the famous flower has its master, and this tune has not been played for a long time.</p>
<p>Zhou Xueyan is the daughter of Zhou Runquan. She sings "Civil and Martial Fragrant Ball", her voice is hoarse but able to maintain its 'glutinousness'. Her beauty and skill are slightly inferior to Zui and Shen; her speech is clever, and both her speaking and singing have unique qualities. A smile from the side also has a unique charm! She is probably used to telling the story of 'private engagement in the back garden,' so at the age of fifteen, she couldn't resist the spring flowers and autumn moon! It has been more than two years since her disappearance. It is said that she was found last year, but she is not prepared to make a comeback. Puyu Society has felt a lack of talent this year. Since the retirement of the three beauties, the society, known for its beautiful talents, has felt even more lonely and desolate.</p>
<h3>How Hu Die Lost Weight</h3>
<p>— Hai Xing</p>
<p>Recently, in the publicly shown "Peerless Beauty," the audience saw that Hu Die had lost weight. How did she lose weight? According to Wang Yin, who recently returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong, "Hu Die, in order to lose weight, not only took medicine, but also didn't eat anything containing fat. She even only ate a small wine cup of rice per meal. Although her stomach was painfully hungry, she always endured it." (Ping's note) Among the readers, there must be many who feel too fat. If you want to lose weight, you might as well imitate this method. But there are many weight loss methods. If readers have better methods, please send them to this publication, which will be happy to publish them. At the same time, there are also many thin people who always want to gain weight, so that their muscles gradually develop. We also hope that everyone will share these weight gain methods.</p>
<h3>On Three Kunling Male Impersonators from Shanghai Performing in Beiping</h3>
<p>— Chen Lin</p>
<p>In the early years, there were many outstanding talents among the Kunling male impersonators in the North, such as En Xiaofeng and Xiao Lanying. Their singing and acting were as good as those of general famous actors. In recent years, among the female performers in the North, there have only been those in the dan (female) roles, and since Meng Xiaodong, there have been no outstanding talents in male impersonation. Last year, the Kunqu amateur Li Yingxiu from Shanghai went north with her teacher Chen Xiuhua. Following her, Chou Ledi, who had been performing in small theaters, also went to Beiping with her father, Chou Yuexiang. This spring, Zhang Wenjuan followed suit. These three have successively performed in Beiping, bringing excitement to the northern paradise, which had long lacked Kunling male impersonators.</p>
<p>Chou Ledi</p>
<p>Among these three, she has the longest history of studying opera and is the most qualified. Her father, Yuexiang, was Meng Xiaodong's first teacher. Because Ledi comes from a family of opera performers, she has advantages over Li and Zhang in many areas, such as "diction" and "martial arts skills," which are indeed better than the others. Ledi's voice is exceptionally good, and she can sing in the "B" key, but unfortunately, it has a slightly feminine tone, which is difficult to compare with Meng Xiaodong's "cloud-covered moon" voice, but otherwise it is generally good. After Ledi went to Beiping, she changed her name to "Meng Youdong." She performed at the Qingleyuan before Li and Zhang. Because she and Meng Xiaodong were sisters in the same profession, Xiaodong helped Ledi everywhere when she first started performing. Because Ledi has a good voice, her performance results are quite good.</p>
<p>Li Yingxiu</p>
<p>Although she is an amateur who has become a professional, her teacher Chen Xiuhua has a deep understanding of opera, which is beyond the reach of ordinary people. Yingxiu learned from Xiuhua and received her true teachings. She has now changed her name to "Li Shaohua" and is performing in Beiping. Li's voice is also good, no less than Ledi's. Although she is a latecomer, she studies diligently and shows great effort. However, her physique is getting fatter, which is a disadvantage for her appearance, and her movements are also less elegant as a result. However, Li's situation is better than the others, and she has formed a troupe to perform, recruiting famous actors, so she has a unique appeal.</p>
<p>Zhang Wenjuan</p>
<p>She came to Beiping later. Recently, she has just finalized her troupe and will perform soon. In terms of skill, Wenjuan is not as good as the previous two, but Wenjuan's voice is wide and broad, with very little feminine tone, which the others lack. Wenjuan is short in stature, which may not appeal to the people of the North. If she performs, her results may not be as good as Chou and Li. However, Wenjuan is very young and extremely intelligent, so her future development is unlimited. Wenjuan has now joined Zhang Rongkui's school. Rongkui's stage combat skills are unique and will surely be passed on to Wenjuan. Wenjuan has also sought advice from Yang Baozhong. Now that she has gone to Beiping, she may be taught by Rongkui and Baozhong.</p>

<h3>A Record of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</h3>
<p>— Xin Ying</p>
<p>The American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is the highest research institution for film art in the United States, and its location is in Hollywood. They routinely announce the list of award winners among the film workers in various departments of Hollywood for the past year. The announcement of this list is usually at the end of February. At the beginning of the new year, all the staff in the academy work particularly hard to evaluate the award-winning filmmakers. They hire experts to be responsible for the evaluation of the award winners in various departments. Not only is each one handled carefully, but they also adopt a fair attitude, without any personal bias. The evaluation work is kept strictly confidential beforehand, and the news will not be leaked. Only after the list is announced will it be confirmed who is on the list.</p>
<p>In terms of filmmakers, everyone believes that receiving the award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is a great honor. Therefore, before the list is announced, filmmakers who consider themselves to be award-winning hopefuls are stretching their necks and waiting for the early announcement of the list. As for people outside the Hollywood film circle, they usually make various predictions about the award-winning filmmakers beforehand, like gambling, you guess who will win, I guess who will win, and some people even bet on it! The closer the date of the announcement, the more tense the atmosphere, so recently, the issue of filmmakers winning awards has become a focus of attention for people in Hollywood.</p>
<h3>Chinese Film News</h3>

<h3>From Love to Family: Increased Wife Power is a Feature of Small Families, Success in Love is Not Success in Career</h3>
<p>— Hua Sheng</p>
<p>Family in theory refers to a clan, because normally, clans are called families. As everyone knows, the family system in our country in the past was a large family system, where clans lived together. Later, small families appeared. This is especially evident in cities, with a husband and wife as the main body, unlike large families where a male or female elder controls the economy and manages all affairs.</p>
<p>After the small family appeared along with the development of some industries, many people stood up to support the small family, saying that the small family was good and the large family was not good. Especially women, who firmly advocated this. The reason is very simple: in a large family, a daughter-in-law has parents-in-law above her, and sisters-in-law and daughters beside her. It is not easy to be a person when everyone oppresses and jostles. Small families are much simpler, and even if there are parents-in-law, they no longer hold power. Women (wives) already have "economic power" and are more free than in large families, so naturally they will agree with small families. How can they still support large families? This is very reasonable.</p>
<p>Men also support small families and do not like large families. Because men in small families are freer than in large families and seem to be more independent. Although the ownership of children is relatively reduced, the ownership of women (wives) is increased - in large families, although the woman who is married is also his wife, the important thing is that she is the daughter-in-law of the parents-in-law, and may not belong to him personally, but mainly belongs to the family. Once in a small family, it seems that she completely belongs to him.</p>
<p>At this time, the idea of love also arose, and it became more important. It was felt that love marriage in a small family was the most ideal way. At this time, marriage often involved struggles between the parties involved and their parents for dominance, which were quite intense. Now, let's just talk about the parties involved in the marriage. The main reason is: love marriage, that is, couples with compatible personalities, are how important for personal (that is, career) achievements. It is said that if couples can truly cooperate, various careers will be easily successful and great careers will be easily achieved. If they are incompatible, nothing can be done successfully. Of course, there are other reasons as well.</p>
<p>In a small family, the compatibility of the personalities of the husband and wife is indeed more important than in a large family. In a large family, when quarrels arise, you can tell your mother-in-law, and there are many others who can mediate; when quarrels arise in a small family, there are fewer people to persuade and prohibit, so it is best not to quarrel. The compatibility of personalities becomes even more important. As for the relationship to career, of course there is a relationship. There is certainly a difference between having one more person to help and having one less person to help. However, to say that the success or failure of a career depends on having a good partner is really inaccurate, and to say that it is mainly due to this is also somewhat exaggerated. The success and failure of a career, whether large or small, is undoubtedly the result of extremely complex social relations, and many things are even related to international relations. People who work together on a career are all a part of the success, and even those who destroy or oppose it are included. The help of a spouse is only a part of it. The general public overestimates it, mostly because it is used to oppose old-fashioned marriages and advocate small family systems, especially to say that autonomous marriages are particularly good. Part of the reason, I think, comes from the movies imported from the United States. - Readers, don't think that I am opposed to individual autonomous marriage. I am not opposed to it at all, and I support it. The above words are just to restore it to its original appearance, and to explain that the success or failure of anything is not a matter for two people, but the result of social and even international relations - of course, this does not mean that personal efforts are therefore unnecessary.</p>

<h3>Various Marriage Problems in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Lao Shan</p>
<p>According to an advertisement in a certain weekly magazine, the number of marriages at the restaurant of the YMCA in Baxianqiao in 1936 was 98, which increased to 186 in 1938, almost doubling. This advertisement is not to show that the restaurant is auspicious, but to reflect that there are many marriages in troubled times. Not to mention this, let's first estimate the wedding banquet and other expenses consumed in Shanghai in the past year. Assuming that there are a total of 100,000 marriages throughout the year, and each marriage does not include the bride price or dowry, but only the banquet and reward expenses, and each family spends 1,000 yuan, then 100,000 new couples will cost 200 million yuan. Even if you cut it in half, it will still be 100 million yuan. This number is not small!</p>
<p>Parents in troubled times think that marrying off their children will fulfill their wishes, but sometimes a single thread of affection cannot tie down a couple. Being able to live peacefully on an isolated island can instead prompt children to disappear. Don't we often see advertisements in the newspapers looking for missing children? Most of them say: "Regarding marriage issues, your mother is not stubborn..." The paper tiger of "a hundred nights of affection for one night of marriage" has long been pierced by the sharp sword of "sin" in loveless marriages. Catching a pair of energetic young people, forcing them to marry, and forcing them to be confined to a small room (Shanghai has no homes, and new couples can only be wronged in small rooms), is as dangerous as wealthy old men in China in the past teaching their sons to smoke opium, so that they are mentally exhausted and do not go out to gamble. Of course, there are many examples in the world where good intentions are rewarded, but the good intentions of forcing children to marry only get bad rewards and will never get good rewards.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are young men and women who are in love and can get married, and can get married in a way that is ceremonious and cost-effective, but generally parents who love face must put on a show, and even demand a certain amount of bride price and a certain amount of dowry. In this way, young people only have two paths. One path is to borrow money to get married, and after marriage, they spend every day like New Year's Eve, paying off debts. The other path is for young men and women to fly away, giving their parents the reward of losing both people and money.</p>
<p>Shanghai is not New York, and there are no news about trial marriages; Shanghai is not Paris, and there are no newspapers manipulated by marriage agencies. Shanghai is, after all, a Chinese city. Although there are 1940s cars and 28-story Western-style buildings, the inner layer is still wrapped in the temperament of a feudal society, and new ideas are developing at the same time. The above-mentioned marriage phenomena are not inexplicable strange phenomena, but reflect one side of the entire Chinese social phenomenon.</p>

<p>A True Record</p>
<h3>It Is Difficult to Know Until You Have Experienced It: An Unsatisfactory Marriage Produces Satisfactory Results</h3>
<p>— Qi Xun</p>
<p>I myself do not deny that I was also a young man who was induced by the objective environment to oppose "the orders of parents and the words of matchmakers." I myself had no love interest, but I was unwilling to accept the marriage arranged by my parents. However, my opposition was not thorough. Under the thought of not being able to violate my parents' wishes, I finally accepted the "order" and "words" half-heartedly.</p>
<p>After the marriage was completed, this lady was indeed very far from the typical woman in my ideal. Not only was she stubborn and money-grubbing, but her dress was also out of date. Her short hair, blue cloth shirt, black silk skirt, white socks, and black cloth shoes were a modern student style in the countryside, but after arriving in Shanghai, it was difficult to integrate with the people of Shanghai society. Therefore, cloth, silk stockings, and high heels were constantly bought for her. However, unexpectedly, not only did I not gain her favor, but I also received many criticisms, such as: "You must know the days when you have no money when you have money, and think of the days when you have it when you have no it. You can't seek temporary beauty, you have to think about a permanent life is the truth..." In the past two years, I don't know how many quarrels and cries have arisen from this kind of thing. However, although she does not pursue fashion and is not as good at socializing as the virtuous wives of my friends, she manages the housework in an orderly manner without any disorder.</p>
<p>The days passed day by day, and the baptism of the great era produced many deformed scenes on the isolated island. The prices of daily necessities soared, making salary earners in danger of starvation. Since August last year, I have been in sorrow every day, but she has used various methods to comfort my heart every day, and also took out the money that she had secretly saved from the household money that I gave her every month, as evidence, to prepare for subsidizing life in the future. In two years, there were actually more than 300 yuan. In addition to joy, looking back at my friends who married fashionable women, only ate and did not work, resulting in high debts, my nerves were severely stimulated, and my spirit, my reason, my actions, and my personality had undergone great changes! My hatred for my wife has turned into respect and love! The distance between her in my heart and the typical woman in my heart in the past is very far. When I have sleepless nights and toss and turn in the quilt, I regret that I should not have hated her in the past, I can't help but shed tears, looking at her sleeping face, I kiss her lightly and stroke her hair.</p>
<p>From then on, the above-mentioned new and old theories and goals about marriage in society have become a mystery in my heart. I can't understand it with my reason alone, and I can't weigh the pros and cons. I have to tell the facts that I have experienced for people to refer to. If I resolutely opposed not marrying her, my life would not be so stable.</p>
<h3>The Origin of Group Weddings: October 30 is Group Wedding Day, the Effect of Chinese Group Weddings</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>In the history of mankind, whether there were group weddings in ancient times is unknown because I can't find any reference materials for the time being. But when we talk about group weddings, we think of the group weddings that have been popular in various countries in recent years, which originated in Italy. Since Mussolini came to power in Italy, in order to rapidly increase the population of Italy, he has spared no effort to encourage the marriage movement. In order to remedy the inability of the poor to marry, it is stipulated that October 30 of each year is the day for group weddings. New couples participating in group weddings do not need to spend much money, which is an economical method.</p>
<p>In the past, the Shanghai municipal government, seeing that many citizens were extravagant in marriage, with the rich spending countless money and the poor going into debt because of marriage, and even being unable to do so due to face, also advocated group weddings, with the mayor officiating the wedding. Married men and women who joined only had to pay a dress fee of ten yuan, and there were no other expenses. The ceremony was both grand and economical, so when the first group wedding was held on April 14, the number of new couples who joined was more than 100 pairs. After that, it was held once a month, and later it was held every two months. Each time it was held, many new couples participated.</p>
<p>Due to Shanghai's advocacy in the past, the county governments in various places also followed suit in organizing group weddings, and Shanghai has not interrupted them until the Republic of China in 1927. It was not until the "August 13" Shanghai war broke out that the municipal authorities, after three and a half months of war, retreated to the interior with the Chinese army, resulting in the interruption of group weddings. Not long after, Shanghai discovered several group wedding service agencies and group wedding agency offices, which organized group weddings. In addition, various hometown associations also organized hometown group weddings after the war.</p>

<p>Strange Marriage Customs</p>
<h3>Interesting Marriage Customs</h3>
<p>— Youren</p>
<p>Speaking of marriage customs, various countries have their own peculiar and strange practices. Now, let me write about the most interesting marriage customs from across the oceans for you readers to discuss during your leisure time:</p>
<p>Marriage Week</p>
<p>In the area of Brittany, their marriage custom involves an annual "Marriage Week." During this period, the general population traditionally suspends work, and women awaiting marriage prepare their dowries a month before the festival. Men awaiting marriage must return home, and then men visit the women's families to propose. However, the women must hide themselves, and the men must search extensively to find them. This is said to train the groom's patience in love.</p>
<p>Courting on Horseback</p>
<p>Before the revolution, Mexicans often won their sweethearts on horseback. According to their customs, a man proposing marriage would dress in splendid attire on a bright, moonlit midnight, hold a cigar in his mouth, carry a stringed instrument, ride a steed to the outside of his sweetheart's residence, and serenade her with songs to express his feelings and move her heart. If successful, the marriage would be arranged. Otherwise, the man would turn his horse around, lower his head, and return home, becoming a defeated loser.</p>
<p>Groping in the Dark</p>
<p>The people of this place, on the eve of the wedding, require the groom to grope for his bride in the dark bridal chamber. During the wedding, the bride must wear a veil, and she is not allowed to open her eyes until she sits on the nuptial bed. When she goes to her new home, she must keep her eyes tightly closed during the journey, guided by two relatives, one holding her hand and the other supporting her head. Many others follow her with lanterns and candles. This kind of marriage custom truly has a unique flavor.</p>
<p>Mother Makes the Decision</p>
<p>Among the Bororo Indians in central Brazil, the union of marriage is somewhat different. The proposal does not originate from the man's idea, nor from the woman's, but from the woman's mother. This method is somewhat similar to the practice of a man being adopted into the wife's family in our country, but their meanings are different. Therefore, many scholars now support their method, and some even advocate that civilized countries imitate it. The method is that the woman's mother, in a public gathering, seeks out a suitable young man, and then invites him to her home to enjoy spicy food. When this young man attends the feast, he must go with his own mother. If he finds the woman agreeable, he will try all the food and give the leftovers to his mother to eat. If his mother also expresses her agreement, she will eat a little as well, and then the marriage will be successful. Speaking of their wedding ceremony, it is also very simple. Four days before the wedding, the groom stays at the bride's house, but only stays; he cannot meet the bride until the fifth morning when they meet and sit in front of the thatched house, declaring the wedding complete. The groom's four-day residence is said to be a test of his temperament. Many people sympathize with and promote this simple wedding.</p>
<h3>Strange Marriage Customs in Binyang</h3>
<p>— Mi Ruozhuo</p>
<p>Binyang—anyone who pays attention to news about the war, I think, won't be unfamiliar with this place name!</p>
<p>Regarding marriage, early marriage is prevalent in Binyang. Boys generally marry at sixteen, and girls at fourteen. Because they feel they are too young, on the wedding day, the bride and groom not only do not feel joyful, but instead reveal expressions of shame and fear everywhere, even resorting to evasion and hiding.</p>
<p>On the first day after the wedding, the bride stays at the groom's house, but the next morning, she returns to her parents' home. Afterwards, even during New Year's and other festivals, the bride remains at her own home. It is not until several years later that the groom's family goes to the bride's house. The family doesn't visit, or question, but is left to happen naturally. However, if the man decides to abandon his wife, he can sell her to others as a servant. Conversely, if she is dissatisfied with her husband, she can only adopt a passive non-cooperation strategy—never returning to her husband's house.</p>
<p>When a woman marries for the first time, the bride price is generally between sixty and one hundred yuan. However, when she remarries, the bride price doubles. But the income from the bride price when remarried does not go to the woman's family, but belongs to the man's family, because as mentioned above, when the man decides to abandon his wife, the man's family can sell her to others as a servant!</p>
<h3>Horrifying Marriage Customs: Only by Chopping Off Limbs Can a Marriage Be Approved</h3>
<p>— Si</p>
<p>Kalichiuma Island, part of the West Indies, is an uncivilized island. The island produces large lizards and crocodiles, which the natives hunt and eat. Explorers have repeatedly risked venturing into this wilderness to explore for mineral deposits, but with no results.</p>
<p>Recently, Dr. Carson flew from the West Indies to the island to explore and suddenly discovered rich antimony ore deposits in the southern corner of the island.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Carson, when he arrived on the island by plane, it was the beginning of the rainy season. He witnessed some natives dancing and rejoicing in the drizzle. Their marriage customs are peculiar and horrifying. After a man and woman fall in love, the man's family gathers relatives and friends and rushes to the woman's house to seize the bride. The woman's family also gathers relatives and friends to resist. The fighting is quite fierce. The woman's family must capture one of the men from the groom's family alive and chop off his hand or foot. Then, the bride is allowed to be kidnapped by the groom's family. The woman's family places the severed limb on the altar and gathers to dance and make merry. The man from the groom's family who has his limb chopped off becomes disabled for life, and the bride and groom are responsible for his support.</p>
<h3>Novel Wedding Ceremonies</h3>
<p>— Junmei</p>
<p>Simple and novel wedding ceremonies, if our memories serve us right, we can vaguely recall: perhaps ten years ago? Liu Peiquan, then commander of the Guangdong Air Force, held an aerial wedding in Shanghai. A pair of newlyweds flew in the sky, and the wedding was considered complete. This truly embodied the saying, "Wishing to be birds flying wing to wing in the heavens!"</p>
<p>Six or seven years ago, a novel wedding ceremony appeared before us again. It was Miss Xu, the daughter of Mr. Xu Zhuodai, and the son of Sun Yusheng, who held a wedding on the water. At that time, it stirred the whole city, and newspapers reported it widely as a beautiful story. However, not long ago, the "aquatic lovebirds" were completely overshadowed by Tarzan, Weismuller, and the famous socialite, Barbara Scott, who used the bottom of a swimming pool as their wedding hall. Although Tarzan is a king of the jungle on the screen, he was originally an active swimming champion. Therefore, he planned to hold the wedding underwater. Thus, the officiant and bridesmaids had to follow the newlyweds into the water for a "drowning" experience.</p>
<p>But novel wedding ceremonies are becoming more and more strange. Since the outbreak of the European War, in Poland and Finland, many young men and women, because they had to take up arms and serve in the rear, had to quickly complete the marriage procedures amidst the chaos of war. Therefore, holding wedding ceremonies in air-raid shelters became as common as bamboo shoots after the rain. It is said that this has also become commonplace in the southwestern inland of our country. "Wishing to be intertwined branches on the ground." Using an air-raid shelter as a wedding hall, with the sound of airplanes and the rumble of bombs, there is a unique feeling in the heart! I wonder what the young men and women, who are in the midst of the red lights and green wine of the isolated island, holding lavish weddings in the grand halls of hotels, would think of this novel wedding ceremony?</p>
<h3>Climbing Trees for Marriage</h3>
<p>In some places in the Philippines, there remains an interesting and lovely marriage custom. When a pair of lovers are in love with each other and wish to pledge their eternal love, their parents find two large trees in the suburbs that are not too far apart, but must be roughly the same height, thickness, and appearance. On the predetermined auspicious day, the couple is asked to stand under the trees and ordered to climb from the roots to the tops of the trees. After climbing, the man stretches out his arms to embrace the woman's tree trunk, while the woman naturally tries her best to help her fiancé achieve this goal. When the tops of the two trees are joined together, the officiant standing under the trees solemnly announces that the wedding ceremony has been completed!</p>
<h3>Marriage Admonitions of the Golden Country</h3>
<p>— Yin Zi</p>
<p>In America, built on a foundation of gold, young men and women do not use gold to solve their marriage problems. They generally adhere to a set of very ordinary admonitions:</p>
<p>For Men:</p>
<p>1. Do not marry a woman who has been divorced multiple times, nor marry a young and alluring woman.</p>
<p>2. Do not marry a frivolous woman.</p>
<p>3. Do not marry a woman who is obsessed with makeup and competing in beauty.</p>
<p>4. Do not marry with the goal of obtaining a woman's wealth.</p>
<p>5. Do not marry a woman who lacks domestic skills and possesses only beauty.</p>
<p>For Women:</p>
<p>1. Do not marry a man who is much younger than oneself.</p>
<p>2. Do not marry a man who drinks heavily and smokes.</p>
<p>3. Do not marry a man who is dissolute and idle without skills or a job, but unemployed people with skills are exceptions.</p>
<p>4. Do not marry a stingy man.</p>
<p>5. Do not marry a hypocritical and cruel man.</p>
<p>6. Do not reject marriage with a poor man.</p>
<h3>The Simplest and Most Reasonable Marriage System in the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>— Qinghui</p>
<p>In the years immediately following the revolution in the Soviet Union, social order was not yet stable, and situations of promiscuity, promiscuity, and chaos in relationships between men and women were unavoidable. However, this abnormal state of affairs is now a thing of the past. Their love affairs are much more serious and proper than in our "land of propriety"! National laws stipulate that men and women are free to marry at the age of eighteen. The marriage procedure is extremely simple. As long as the man and woman go to the marriage registration office of the national administrative organ, pay a small fee, register, and they become an official couple.</p>
<p>In the Soviet Union, when a man gets married, it does not mean that he will bear a terrible family burden from then on, or that the woman must be bound by her husband. No! Absolutely not! In the Soviet Union, no husband can bind his wife, nor does any wife have to rely on her husband for support. Both parties are completely independent socially and economically.</p>
<p>As for divorce? It is not permitted without the consent of both parties and a valid reason. The divorce procedure is also a matter of registration.</p>
<p>After a divorce, the support of children is still shared by both parties. If one party earns a higher salary, that party contributes more.</p>
<p>If a woman becomes pregnant after marriage, maternity leave is her special right. During the leave, the agency where she works not only continues to pay her salary as usual, but also provides allowances. The maternity leave period is two months before childbirth and two months after childbirth, for a total of four months. All medical and healthcare expenses during childbirth are provided free of charge by the state.</p>
