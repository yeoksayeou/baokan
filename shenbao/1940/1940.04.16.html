<p>社評</p>
<h3>歐局開展與義大利</h3>
<p>歐洲風雲，已因德國進犯斯干蒂那維亞而向全世界的多方面邁進。現在激烈的戰爭，雖只限於北歐一隅；爭取的目標雖也只限於挪威海岸，但是這些情形絕非所謂第二階段歐戰的本體，亦非其全貌，而祗是第二階段的初步，初步所得說明第二階段的，祇是戰爭範圍趨嚮擴大，中立國的地位，更趨困難，不復能持續其以往的噯昧，實逼處此，必須衣明其立塲：若非投入德國方面，即是投人英法方面。不但環境已不容其徘徊，抑且時間亦不許其猶豫。析言之，西歐的荷此魯森堡是如此，巴爾幹的羅馬尼亞，南斯拉夫，土耳其，希臘也是如此，甚主南歐的翹楚義大利也必如此。小國的受侵犯較易，其反動的顯示其態度乃如響斯應；例如挪威，雖最初對德稍優容而對英法稍嚴肅，但轉瞬之間，却因抗德而與英法成與國。至於中立的大國，實力較雄厚，地位較重要，既往歷史與目前環境較複雜，政治色彩較濃厚，而其立國願望亦較遠大。這在交戰國方面當然亦視中立小國爲易與，而對大國則因多所顧忌而必須另眼看待；施以威脅既不易使之曲從，予以利誘亦不易使之滿足；歐戰七閱月以來，交戰國在軍事之外，在國際的政治經濟外交種種方面，在種種煙慕之下，所鈎心鬥角者，要在對於較大的中立國的獵取而已。歷史不會重演的、我們不能刻畫了第一次歐戰中的種種，來按索目前。回憶當年，自始便是主力戰，而不是像這一次的深溝高壘的濠塹戰，所以這决交戰國雙方的實力，雖經過了七月戰鬥可說是完全沒有折損。交戰國雙方的從事戰爭，彼此鄭重的不以實力相賭博而祗賭時間，故若檢點戰塲，則相持七月，而誰勝誰負，還是一個整個的未知數。義大利的態度亦不同於第一次，他在戰爭開始時候，一面聲明不參加任何一方，一面却又作種種姿態，種種表情，顯示其準備隨時參加戰爭。這是普天之下的大謎，誰也不能斷定謎底是怎的！</p>
<p>表情姿態倘若不是虛僞的，可知義大利小欲置身事外；而其徘徊噯昧，却分並非自命爲絕無偏袒。自從戰爭開始以來，他的言論頗不平庸，他的行動也不示弱；法西領袖一再昭告其人民，枕戈待旦，而其在巴爾幹方面的外交策動，尤見堅持其政策。其言論，其行動，其政策。逈乎不同於中立，而明示世人以偏向於其軸心中的德國。推求因果，原非意外，蓋義大利外交政策實有四個基點：第一，義國與德國的同盟關係，原非整個的健全的而是跛行的，故並無助德作戰的義務，但義國爲對付國際計，仍以抱殘守缺爲較利，故對德維持其密切的體態，對戰爭維持其『保留』態度。第二，義大利等待最有利的時機到來，以備一舉而獲償其願望；析其願望，一部份與德國相矛盾，而一部份有待英法的讓予。第三，德國元首希特勒明知義國首相墨索里尼的願望與態度；且希特勒滿以爲德國戰勝英法，不在乎義國的援助，祗要義國不助英法；故德國對義國，所期待者少，而所期許者多；故義國不打算拼命，而祗準備在最後勝利關頭，流最少的血，奏最大的功。第四，義國國力雖强，較英法德則有遜色，若在平時急起直追，亦難遽望項背；及至戰爭爆發，這在交戰國是雙方消耗的時期，在義大利是建設的時期，亦即使國力並駕齊驅的最好機會。因此四基點，遂使義大利採取既往七個月以來的態度。但是國際情勢，戰局演變，使義國不想長此旁觀。</p>
<p>不旁觀則如何？昨天義京電訉報告，義國外相齊亞諾的機關報『電聞報』經理安薩爾杜，突然向義國陸軍發表廣播演說，略謂：</p>
<p>『義國正等待最有利益之機會，參加歐戰；渠以爲北歐戰事爆發後，任何國家，均難避免戰禍矣。義國人民，倘幻想義國終可避免參戰，或幻想義國僅須覓取外匯利潤，均爲莫大之錯誤。挪威等小國，尙小免捲入戰爭漩渦，而况義國與交戰國爲鄰；且保有地中海各項利益，將如何避不參戰乎？義國已整飭軍備，等待利於義國之時機，此項時機，於一月前尙覺遙遙無期，而目前已威迫在眉睫矣。吾人不僅應在物質上準備作戰，精神方面，亦應準備於一二星期內或將爆發之戰事云。』</p>
<p>這是歐戰發展到北歐以後反應，即是歐戰第二階段初步以後的進步。但是義大利的砲口愴口，究竟向着那一方面？演說辭中並沒有給人捉摸，何况向前走，向後轉，同是仕何隊伍慣常而輕易的動作啊！昨天還有一項傳說，據稱：</p>
<p>『巴爾幹外交界昨晚消息；墨索里尼首相已在韃靼海峽進口處之多特堅尼羣島集中艦隊。義大利此種海軍新發動，此間認爲係羅馬柏林軸心戰、略之一部，衆信乃去月德義兩國首腦在勃倫納山隘會議時所磋商者。同時據稱：墨索里尼首相準備動員一百二十五萬後備軍，企圖粉碎協約國與土耳其之互助條約，』</p>
<p>這說明動向了，但甚有可疑；因爲電訉播送者是美國合衆社，電訉來源是英國倫敦，消息根據是所謂巴爾幹外交界，而所傳對象却在韃靼海峽。因此種種，誰得而尋根究底。</p>
<p>義國有關的消息，因義國在歐洲的國際地位關係而使人不敢視如無物，置若罔聞。何況義國眞是決不長此旁觀。所應分別體認的；報紙經理的演說不即是政府當局的命令，對陸車的廣播不即是對國際的宣言。命令與宣言，在義國首相墨索里尼與外相齊亞諾翁婿二人眞是優爲之。現在的北歐烽火誠然驚動了義國，而義國消息富然也能驚動了交戰國，即如義國在這時候表示不以外滙利潤爲滿足，亦夠驚動交戰國了；但是動的後文不即是衝鋒或放愴。義國海陸空三軍具有發動攻勢的力量，而其海陸空三防却使義國當局多所籌措；故義國即使對戰爭有所發動，亦決不貿然以其外交政策的四基點來決定其攻勢的動嚮，還須以其軍事上的海陸空三防來決定其動嚮的取捨。而所謂義國準備一二星期內或將爆發戰事，暫時可以視爲北歐戰局勝負在一二星期內或將分曉。一二星期在歷史上眞是一霎那，這是義國不想長此旁觀的註解。</p>

<h3>紗花　棉紗多頭　如醉如狂　雙馬抬至一千四百元　空戶擱淺者日有所聞</h3>
<p>紗市　升、且漲風愈熾、此　情形、殊屬可畏然市塲上一鼓熱烈之氣、依然勇猛、日日在跳、大有漲無止境之象、不過目前內籌碼週折較緊、實銷　滯、現貨一鬆、將後之反動、亦不可不防也、　一般囤戶吸收仍旺云、</p>
<p>現紗晨開英美匯兌雖長、而外棉亦疲弱、然人氣依舊緊張、買氣濃密、二十支雙馬廠單漲一千三白二十五元、惟買戶踴躍、市價步開步升、直到一千三百九十五元、現實漲出一千四百元關外、查半日間成交統計三千一百三十五包、行情二十支雙馬現貨漲五十餘元、廠方由永安廠開出二十支特金城五萬包、價爲一千三百五十元至三白七十五包、今日有棉紗四百八十六件運香港、茲將各帮買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>同行二、四二五香港　五四五福州　一六五統計三、一三五</p>
<p>按近來棉紗狀况、漲風之劇、爲亘古以來所罕見、前昨兩日、步步在跳、連出二重大關、先漲破一千三百元外、昨日再穿出一千四百元外、然漲風雖熾、耳聞空方無力支持擱淺者、倒閉人家日多、某紗市塲更形不穩、照吐情形而論多方在抬亦可束手矣、因爲如果一味猛漲、賺了錢、恐亦拿不到手也、</p>
<h3>廠辦轉暢　棉價愈高</h3>
<p>本棉交易頗形起色、印棉需要亦見興旺、廠方因紗布市價暴騰、對於原料頗有採辦觀念、因之市價亦跟踪而上、茲將現棉成交、情形列左、</p>

<p>另訊外棉市價紐約棉市、昨日殊為平靜、後內南方幫之在市套賣、及一部份限價之賣出、市况稍形回疲、結果收盤價格較之上日跌二三磅音、印度棉巾亦因受歐局之牽制、昨日　日預測跌三羅比、埃及跌十磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日父因紗價之高漲、滙兌又縮、默局父形擴大、印棉因運輸困難、各同業在市搜購現貨頗烈、尤以供紡二十支原料爲最、竟有無棉可購之虞、廠方進胃甚旺、目前祗能購訂期貨矣、日方廠商亦殊活躍、茲將昨日棉市以美滙六元折合送廠價如下、</p>

<h3>疋頭　布價上漲　竟無虛日</h3>
<p>布市以外傳歐戰有擴大之說、紗價飛騰、市十買氣濃厚、個布上午開價均漲、細布。細斜·粗布每疋加起五角至一元、午後市面更緊續漲一元左右、漂染布全日漲起一元至二元、各廠喊價更爲高昂、本街成交各貨在二千件以上、客銷以粵滇帮爲最佳、辦　漂布、色布·色斜·細布·粗布等六百餘件、皖帮辦條漂布·色布等貨一百餘件、浙閩帮需胃較淡、十六日運查盡布疋一百四十五件、</p>
<p>東布晨開平平、旋以北帮　辭、市盤直綫上　、午刻龍　細布售開四十二元五角、叫君子嗶嘰一元三角三分半後市本街同業進胃突旺、漲勢益猛、細布每疋續升二元外、嗶嘰每碼在跳一角、收市龍頭爲四十五元五角、嗶嘰一元四角八分半、又創空前高價、</p>
<h3>證劵　外股橫跳　會德豐十倍其値</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤、昨日市况、復起跌風、歐洲戰事、蔓延極速、余子在漲、加以本埠謠言蠢起、人心惶慮、出　及套賣者隨時可見、交易不多、趨勢極軟、開盤由高價、直趨下游、全日以最小價收盤、昨日上午、初開由多方拉抬丙　、以九角開盤、維持的五分鐘後、賣氣漸濃、漸趨軟化、潤利怡泰及二十號三十八號等先後賣出、鴻大仁昌益昌久豐等、初則頗有吸收、後亦漸感滿足、午後即小二角左右、午後德孚價孚均來吐出、十一號及十四號北帮賣出尤湧、買戶愈見稀少、久豐澗利稍有抵補、結果共回小三角至四角半、成交總數共計約六七十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交大達輪船公司股五十股、每股價爲五十五元正、</p>
<p>又衆業公所股市、因週期交易開始、價格欣欣向榮、晨初拍板時因隔晚決定之定單擁擠、交易至爲熱鬧、各種實業股幾俱有買戶興趣、其中尤以英聯·鋼業·怡和·等爲最活躍、各執股公司股需求亦佳、成交則不甚旺，買方加碼心思竟日未衰、價格緩步上升、直至最後、多方勢力愈强、晚收價爲一日中之最佳者、</p>
<p>橡皮股被忽視、雖滙市堅俏、投資者暫時似在畜意出籠橡皮股、而換取實業股、故多數價格下降、</p>
<p>按國際信託股票、票面十兩、今已漲至二十七元七角五分、上海銀公司票面五兩、昨已爲二十九元五角、會德豐股票面十兩、去年最高七十六元、最低廿八元、昨巳漲至一百六十元、所漲不止十倍、怡和股票五兩、昨已至五十五　半、</p>
<h3>糧食　米市轉平</h3>
<p>昨日米市、爲先疲後緊之局、而收盤適成平平、昨日早市初開、若原根客販旣懷貨守伺、其零躉作客、皆鮮問津、當時頗有相持不決之勢、銷塲淸淡異常、迺浮囤散戶心思漸餒、首先傾脫行情喊低半元有奇、一般店胃方始出手、略事添辦、售開小絞四十元、一號西貢四十四元三角、二號四十一元二角、而內地鄕莊等客戶亦繼起棄廉搜羅、頃刻銷塲立旺、市面急轉直上、似有打破週前高價之勢、客販突將手中各貨大批推出　見市貨擁擠、供求頓勻、昂勢遂挫、不易冉升、從此一路徘徊、迨收市未有變化、收盤行情悉與週前相埒、至於粳糯國米、由虹口大昌公司輸人界內奢、兩朝共有五千餘包、而粳米交易、因運日市面高漲、各貨價格標準已超限盤之上、致貨主惜於身本、市上又無出樣、塲外暗盤、亦無所榮辱、常帮高粳爲四十五元、中四十三四元、常州及崑粳四十三四元、蘇同淸粳、四十四元、四十三元半、粉粳四十二三元、靑洲眞特薄四十五元、冲特四十四元、大市四十三元半、四十三元左右、南港早晚稻四十二元、次至四十一元半、糯米市相與各貨並行、亦皆站住、未見軒輊、</p>
<p>昨日有　米一萬一千包、裝太古公司南昌輪運往天津、並有苞米一千五百包、係順天輪退關、改裝南昌輸運津、該項洋米、係達孚洋行終售、</p>
<p>洋米在上午尙居平站之局、雖有南洋帮辦去小絞西貢暹邏各米近萬包、而行情祇人三四角、及至午後、市上謠言蜂起、若中立國之加入戰渦也、遠期定貨絕望也、莫不爲行囤大戶所張目、新囤活潑、行客競買、市面頓見緊張、期現各貨一致上騰、一號西貢途貨上午開五十二元半者、下午跳漲達五十四元、竟猛升一元半之鉅、二號四五月份上午最但五十一元半開價、逐步上升至五十二元三角、午後開五十二元半至五十三元三角、拾級而上、上下午竟跳漲一元八角、現洋米一號西貢上午開四十五元、繼加半元、午後　四十六元、　他各米一致上升、午後高價均比上午開較大近元、全日交易活潑、總計現米一萬七八千包、期七百頓、</p>
<h3>麺粉堅　麥仍擯持</h3>
<p>粉市徵挺、查　號粉廠盤仍為十三元五角、在國際時局小安、物價昂貴聲中、各廠認爲廠盤係維持本街性質、故暫不加增、但實據上本街零銷、各號門市殊見淸閑、邇日客銷雖略有採取、而客盤則仍須十五元之高價、致客化父畏縮不前、間有去路者、亦屬有限、聞四號粉價開十二元、客帮稍有購動、回籠貨老車牌底碼已枯、昨開十三元四角八分、本街及內地成交二三千包、由廠家批出　的計七八千包、市因金貴米漲、及車站運輸時、被某方阻碍、故局勢漸形活絡、</p>
<p>麥市交易、尤見擯局、全日因價已跌至二十一元半後貨　均有扳守之意、况目下內地有麥已枯、洋麥定　愈昂、執貨者不肯輕脫、而連日廠胃平淡、意欲擯小、故雙方擯持之交、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆銷路活躍　行情漲半元</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆市况、在晨初尙屬平定、人後出口去路有香港厦門、內銷有油廠本街囤戶等、致人心向榮、行情梢砌、午後盛傳意大利亦已加入歐戰、故一般行囤以爲有機可乘、市　頓被鼓勵昂騰、結果高豆再漲半元、中次亦帶起角外、統共成交蚌埠豆三車、價爲二十元五角、安慶豆八白餘包、價爲廿二元五角至二十二元、蕪湖豆六百包價爲廿一元、廿元零二角、靑島豆五百包、價爲二十七元五角、丁家卅豆三百包、價爲二十二元八角、又豆子今（十六日）有二千一百八十包、運往香港、</p>

<h3>糖市　車白加起半元</h3>
<p>昨糖市據香港電、太車白B嘜已升至港幣一六·〇五漲〇·四五、故本市公會劃盤均見隨緊、現貨二叫粗白外棧新到貨初爲六十三元七八角、旋由九角至九角半、而至四元三角、轉口貨仍五十一元、太古車白升半元、B嘜西棧初爲六十五元半至八角、後爲七十元、餘照退H嘜車赤升七角、初爲四十九元，後到五十元、荷赤五十二元七八角、至五十三元升二角、本雪白六十三元、本一號冰七十六元半、晶明冰七十八元、國糖開出條靑四十六件、三十九元、石門片靑百餘包、四十三元五角、</p>
<h3>南北貨泉圓產區存貨　甌幫搜辦一空</h3>
<p>泉州桂圓、昨　產區客方函訊、因爲甌帮搜採存貨已罄、而辦價比前升十八元、　本届新圓拋價亦被帶高、返視申市、以實銷不　、後到之貨、迄未開出、市勢頗有下遊之象、倒懸日甚　市價　二十九年四月十五日星期一</p>

<h3>江灣日軍大隊西開　靑滬路發生激戰　日軍千餘名由趙巷進發　華軍顧復生部奮起接觸</h3>
<p>昨晨（十五日）拂曉、本埠租界邊區之虹橋路一帶居民、突聞隆隆砲聲、時斷時續、茲經向夾自靑滬公路及虹橋路之旅客方面探悉、離滬約三十公里之滬西靑滬公路趙巷西南游擊隊與日軍發生大規模接觸、雙方激戰之烈、實爲滬郊過去若干游擊戰中所僅見、上海江灣區之日軍、大部均巳抽赴靑滬公路作戰、</p>
<p>日坦克車　四輛出動</p>
<p>蓋曾有日方軍用卡車十七輛、滿載日軍約達六七百名、並附坦克車四輛、先於前日經大西路中山路虹橋路、而折入靑滬公路之趙巷鎭駐防、同時滬西各據點、如黃渡·南翔·蟠龍·諸地、徐涇·漕河涇等一帶、亦均增加日軍、自數十名增至一二百名、及至昨晨拂曉五時、大隊日軍、大舉由趙巷向西南進發、進攻淞滬游擊隊第三支隊顧復生部、該處爲顧部主力所在、遂亦舊勇接戰、</p>
<p>戰事激烈　迄晚未止</p>
<p>動員之日軍、當在一千五百餘各、而華方亦有相當人數、故衆信雙方損失、必極慘重、至於是役結果、因該旅客等離靑滬交界處之七寳時、在下午二時、業已劇戰達七小時之久、猶未停息、至虹橋鎮時、尙能聞得密集之機關槍聲、並悉七寳以西之杜家行、先於本月十二日下午二時、有日軍及僞軍徐星洲于陶生等部、被顧部襲擊、日軍此舉、似爲報復、又悉昨日出動之日軍、爲田中部隊、華軍爲顧復生部、</p>
<p>安亭日軍　趕築工事</p>
<p>據崑山來人云、沿京滬鐵路之安亭站、屬於崑山靑浦交界、又黃渡站、屬於靑沛嘉定交界、均爲大上海市之近郊、離滬不足二十公里、各該處本有游擊隊、與僞軍劃界而駐、雙方接洽不打同胞、而僞軍担任代爲供給情報、日軍明知、但求安謐、不敢吹求、乃最近該地到有新四軍一千餘員名、已將游擊鐵與僞軍收編、故日軍大恐、日退集車站、趕築工事、異常忙碌、</p>
<h3>歐戰與　米價無關　讕言不攻自破　米市又呈穩定</h3>
<p>運日米市、因投機者謠傳歐戰與洋米運滬有關、而略形上漲後、終因事實上並未受阻、此說不攻自破、且國米來源、亦漸暢達、故米市塲於昨日開市後、價格又吿穩定、米行業茶會市塲、特於昨日發貼一三一號公吿云、「本市塲春季入塲證、截止至本月十四日期滿、一律作廢、夏季新證、除各米號仍向米號業公會換領、掮客由聯誼社彙領外、凡我同業、以及各經售號、務於本月十五日至十七日、每日上午八時至下午五時、規定期內、檢齊舊證、並帶三個月茶費、向北辦事處換領新證、再「行客彙編」業已刊就、每本收價五角、並可帶款領取、特此公吿週知、</p>
<h3>納稅會昨函旅業　增捐交涉經過</h3>
<p>公共租界納稅華人會、前應旅館業　業公會之要求、轉函工部局交涉核减旅社營業執照捐稅、該會業經轉函工部局、惟迄今未獲該局答復、茲納稅會已於日昨函復旅業公會、詳述交涉經過、</p>
<h3>難民收容所　勢難解散　願回籍者給路費　老弱仍設法安挿</h3>
<p>本市各慈善機關、雖會有遺散之說、惟據難民救濟協會負責人稱、該會直屬之收容所、僅惇信路第一收容所、其他如慈聯總會。慈聯分會所屬尙有收容所三十二處、該項收容所主要給義米煤二項、均由難民救濟協會供給、目前雖云給養困難、疏散事宜、在積極進行中、惟並不一定在三十日强行解散、此刻正屆春耕時節、一部分年靑力壯之難民、自願回籍謀生者、當由所方給予相當之遺散費、但一般老弱者、仍須易謀安挿之法、</p>
<h3>財政部新輔幣　輾轉流入滬市　鋁質首批發竣二批抵滬　領用分幣券仍採申請制</h3>
<p>財政部調整各種輔幣成色重量之後、已由中央造幣廠成都昆明桂林蘭州等廠、鑄造一分二分五分十分新輔幣、是項新輔幣經審查委員會審查合格、交中央銀仃發行流通市面、上海方面雖不運來發行、但轉輾流入上海者、亦得照常通用、新聲社記者昨向銀行界探悉、新輔幣係銅鋅合鑄、惟五分十分含有鎳一成八、故色黃、因銅成份最多、式樣正面「中華民國二十九年二靑天白日徽章、反面古錢模型、註明壹分二分五分十分字樣、</p>
<p>鋁質輔幣　首批發竣</p>
<p>鋁質分五分新輔幣、係上海銀行業同業公會請求財政部批准、專在上海一埠發行、第一批一千萬枚業已發行完竣、第二批一千萬枚、一分五分各半、運抵上海之後、即將啣接第一批發行、暫限於銀行錢莊領用、凡銀錢業公會會員行莊、及洋商銀行公會會員銀行、均得向銀錢業準備會庫、及英商滙豐銀行領用、至於各公司行號工廠、得向往來之行莊酌量調換、</p>
<p>分券發出　三百萬元</p>
<p>中央銀行上海分行前經財政部核准發行一分五分分幣券、規定總額爲七百萬元、委託美商永寗印刷公司承刷、業已由該行視市面需要隨時發行、補救輔幣缺乏恐慌、今已發出總約三百萬元、以五分券局多數、藍市上需要五分劵正殷、此後決不因鋁質輔幣發行而停發、惟爲鄭重起見、仍採用申請制、凡各業因正當需要均得向該行請求、</p>
<h3>納稅西人　明日開年會　日擬作政治進攻　華人注意增捐案</h3>
<p>聚張情形足以與本屆工部局董事競選相比擬之納稅西人會年會、定於明日下午二時三十分，假跑馬廳總會來行、就目前情勢而論、日人勢將在本屆年會中、利用增加市政捐百分之五十案、對工部局採取攻勢、而展開英美對日之政治鬥爭、實有極大可能性、英美方面現對於其納稅人有投票權者、較日人所有者爲少一點、極表焦慮、蓋英美所能操縱者、厥維歐洲僑民集團之投票也、關於加捐案、華人」致東視、希望能懸崖勒馬、勿引起嚴重問題、茲分誌各情如决、</p>
<p>莫肅擔任　大會主席</p>
<p>公共租界工部局木屆納稅西人年會定於明日下午二時、假座跑馬廳總會舉行、屆時由名推事莫肅擔任主席、總董樊克令報吿工部局一年來施政槪况、討論提案中、除審核上年度決算書及修正年會議事規則外、以通過一九四〇年至一九四一年一六·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元新預算案爲最重要、因工部局擬自本年七月」日起增加市政總捐。特別房捐。地捐附加費百分之五十、即合併於該案中討論、爲各方一致重視、</p>
<p>華人重視　加捐問題</p>
<p>查加捐案自發表後、中外納稅人反對均甚强烈、納稅華人會且根據納稅人意旨曾有書面抗議、請懸崖勒馬、現此案已臨討論關頭、記者昨向納稅華人會某要員探詢、據謂、加捐案絕對多數華人之意嚮、應爲當局尊重、外僑納稅人當亦勿願作繭自縛、加捐之後果、吾人已屢言之、不僅納稅人增加負擔問題、實與整個市面及社會治女、有重大之關係、</p>
<p>盼納稅人　一致出席</p>
<p>目前英美日三國選舉委員會方面、努力爭取其贊助者、使彼等確能於年會舉行時出席、而採一致行動、連日已有顯著之發展、美僑委員會已特爲此舉召開緊急會議、除工部局下年度預算外、並印就抗辯書、分散於納稅人、以便彼等參加納稅西人年會時之參考、日僑納稅人、亦已數度在蓬路日僑總會集議如何對待本屆年會之辦法、英國駐滬總領喬治氏早已將彼個人簽名之函件、分寄各納稅人、促彼等注意木屆納稅西人年會、而保證每一納稅人均能出席參加、以維持整個英僑團體之權益、</p>
<p>日僑揚言　將有提案</p>
<p>據日文報紙表示、日人現正欲極力使本屆納稅西人年會意見分裂、而成爲兩大顯著之壁壘、雖工部局方面對提付本屆納稅西人年會之提議、早經公布須於開會前六日寫就送交工部局、但日文半官方機關報大陸新報、竟忽視此點、而宣稱在本屆年會中、日方將提出緊急臨時動議、又悉日僑納稅人、今晚或將由林雄吉氏召開會議、據消息難通者稱、此項會議、將決定日方是否將繼續採取政治攻勢、在工部局中爭取其優越之地位</p>
<p>局方派員　促請參加</p>
<p>又工部局昨派昌向各國僑民談話、對此次納稅西人年會有所指示、藉以提高納稅人之興趣、而出席投票、其言略云、「納稅人須注意下列各項、（一）君須參加本屆年會、（二）納稅西人年會定明日下午二時半、在跑馬廳舉行、（三）除非納稅人離滬　因病不克出席、不能代理投票表決、（四）工部局對車輛之規定、略爲納稅人汽車駛入進口後、須駛繞馬塲一周後、由巡捕指揮前往停車處停車、（五）官方汽車由馬霍路進口、停車於調馬塲、</p>
<h3>煤業公會請當局　保護運煤船隻</h3>
<p>本市茂泰·華祥·正大·等煤號、昨致函煤業公會稱、敝號爲裝運煤觔之船隻、出入蘇州河問、每於夜間屢被流氓等竊損、若輩目無法紀、蠢湧上船、橫使侗嚇、强行搬取、敝行因衆寡懸殊、抵抗乏術、並於船抵麥根路义袋角碼頭卸貨之際、更有大批游民、結集前來、明拾暗竊、不可理喻、無法制止、據上述情形、爲特耑函呈請貴會、備文轉呈公共租界警務當局、請求予以保護、而蘇商困、聞煤業公會已照轉警務處、請予以保護、</p>
<h3>法司令加斯維爾　明日離滬返法　昨在跑馬廳檢閱各國防軍　為近來滬上最大盛况之一</h3>
<p>昨晨十時、英美日法義駐滬防軍、均列隊於靜安寺路跑馬廳、山行將離滬之法駐軍總司令加斯維爾大佐加以檢閱、萬國商團白俄隊、昨亦列隊參加、據悉此項檢閱、爲近來滬上最大盛况之一、加斯維爾大佐乘自備汽車駛往跑馬廳、由全身武裝之警士六名護送、抵塲後、即由各國駐軍常局迎接、表示歡迎、加斯維兩氏隨即環行一周、與五十餘各國駐軍高級軍官握手致謝、加斯維爾大佐定明日乘Jean．Laborda號離滬赴巴黎、渠之繼任者、則爲愛沙蒂氏、</p>
<h3>馬歇爾著文論述　中國工業進步驚人　西南後方重鎭已成工業重心　成績輝煌絢爛已堪自足</h3>
<p>「中國季刊」春季號、載有英國商會主席馬歇爾氏論文一篇、對中關工業之發展情形、推崇備至、渠認爲中國工業之猛進、不特堪以自給自足、且可使國家躍臻富裕、以與其他各國爭衡、其文略云、</p>
<p>內地工業　突飛猛進</p>
<p>『一九三七年、中日戰爭爆發後之結果、中國之近代新工業區、泰半被毀、或淪於日人掌握此於中國、固爲莫大之損害、然中國工業、因是而能在後方蓬勃生長、充分發揮其力量、並享受發展之自由與保障且能積極建設、大量生產、遠勝一九三七年時之中國工業、實足令人驚嘆、根據工部局工業科及中央政府之共他報吿、吾人可知中國工業、已突飛猛進、而臻成功之境、反之、在一切淪陷區禿、各種工廠、天半停頓恢復無力、縱或有恢復營業者、亦難以補償其一九三七年之損失、此固由於被毀之劇、揆其主因、則大半係山日人經營之故、</p>
<p>工廠遍佈　有若繁星</p>
<p>據報吿所稱、在非淪陷區內之工業、非但已有廣大之發展、工廠之廣佈、目已遍及各地、有如繁星、此外、合作事業之活躍、亦使新生之工廠、步入遠大之前程、但另一方面、尤有其他因素、如交通之日臻通達、對外貿易之繁榮、原料之大量開發等等、由於上述種種、中國西南及西部、已開闢一嶄新之天地、而成全國工業之重心、</p>
<p>別關蹊徑　解除困難</p>
<p>惟目前中國西部之工業、仍有困難、此種困難、非因與其他部分競爭所致、其唯一困難、乃在於水道運輸之阻隔、而公路運輸、亦未臻充分發達之故、其解決困難之道、唯在一端、即設法建立雲南緬甸鐵路、但此項計劃、尙未完全成功、而事實上鐵路之成、亦非二三年內所可政、故解決之途、仍須另覓蹊徑、全國各實業家、遂集中注意、如伺化整爲零、使業已建立之大工廠、分化爲小型工廠、蓋小工廠之設立、機械設備、均較大工廠爲易也、惟就今日之成績言之、中國新生之工廠、其產量實已足使中國自給自足、而不必仰求於外國矣、綜觀二年半以來、中國工業狀態、似已有極大之變動、昔之被視爲重要工業區者、已不復爲人注意、反之、昔奢洪荒之區、今則已成爲最軍要之工業區矣、』</p>
<h3>防癆運動　昨已閉幕</h3>
<p>自本埠名醫丁福保丁惠康發起防癆運動、於上月十五日在霞飛路虹橋療養院開幕以來、時已一月、於昨日依限截止、據虹橋療養院統計、在此短短一月內、前往檢騐體格者、共計二千一百餘人、而須攝愛克司光者、亦有五白餘人、可見木埠平民患肺癆病之衆多、惟照國人習慣、凡患此類病症者、大都諱莫如深、更在此百物高漲聲中、維持生活、尙感困難、安有餘款顧念及此、自丁氏父子發起此運動後、因檢騐費用低微、一般平民始稍稍予以注意、惟盼此一運動、由私人而擴展至公共、則經濟不虞竭蹶、然後方能成爲一永久之機關、蓋此種運動、殊有繼續推行之必要也、</p>
<h3>國際救濟會　完成任務　月內辦結束　仍保留名義</h3>
<p>上海國際救濟會、爲滬各領袖善團及中外人士於滬戰時組織、其時滬郊砲火連天、難民逃生無路、該會既係國際組織、出入虹口，搶救最力、嗣國軍西撤、南市難民、亦多由該會營救、而贊助難民區之成立、尤著勞績、經先後設立大規模收容所六處、主持收容遺散難民、總計不下二十萬人、該會設有工藝組、首先創導難民生產、俾節省公衆負祖、於去年並協助法租界當局、收容街頭乞丐、施以感化敎育、茲以上海難民、由難民救濟協會統籌收容、且目前收容人數、較前大見减少、認爲任務已吿一段落、刻正準備於本月底辦理結束、惟國際救濟會之名義、或仍將保留，</p>
<h3>財部飭各關頒發　戰時津貼　江海關已撥付</h3>
<p>財政部爲體恤各地海關關員生計起見、特頒發「戰時津貼」、無論關員、稅警或差役等、咸以四成照付，月得新俸百元者、即津貼四十元、該項津貼至戰事停止即行取消、可見當局之關懷下屬矣、茲據新聲社記者探悉、江海關是項津貼、本於本月二十五日於發付正式薪俸時一次付給、茲悉該關已提前付發第一批即內勤者、已於本月十二，十三兩日內分別付發、第二批則已定於今明兩日內發給、該項津貼係於本年三月份起、故四月份津貼尙未付發、聞定於本月二十五日一次付給、獲得該項津貼者、最尠爲十餘元、最多爲一百八十餘元左右、至於前决核准照發米貼、仍繼續發付、於米價回跌至十五元以下時、再行取消、關於他地海關、亦已分別照發、</p>
<h3>僑胞季阿吉　報國情殷　自嘆年老未能從征　月以餘奉獻祖國</h3>
<p>據華僑籌賑會消息、蔣委員長夫人最近接得荷囑婆羅州六十七歲華僑獵人季阿吉獻金五十三元、並附函稱、渠生活海外、已歷三十載愛國之情、無時或巳、如年事尙壯、極願返國參戰、以損驅沙塲爲榮、今旣老　、資財又乏、爲勉盡國民天職、當月以餘款、奉獻祖國、以供抗建之用、按季阿吉初到婆羅州時、木爲經商、數年以前、不景氣潮流波及荷矚東印度、季阿吉事業失敗、遂致傾家蕩產、貧無所依、自此藉行獵爲活、渠於去歲匕八兩月、巳分別匯寄四十元及四小元零。角一分至重慶、</p>
<h3>美商電臺　仍遭電波擾亂　可用器械測知擾亂所在　但上海尙無此種新機器</h3>
<p>大陸報云、本市美商XMHA無綫電臺之波長、昨日（十四日）仍遭外來電波擾亂、致昨晨迄晚假該雷臺廣播之基督敎會講道、昔樂節目及阿爾考脫氏之新聞報吿、均受影響、基督敎會報吿員昨晚在該電臺播昔時、曾斥此爲「惡意之擾亂」、並謂聽眾未能淸晰聆得講道播音者、可索　印就之全交、又央文大美晚報云、據該無綫電工程師聲稱、今可用器械約略測知擾亂電波之來源地、但測定其確切地點、則須有特製器械、今上海尙無此種最新式之特裝器械可得、故XMHA電臺所受擾亂之來源、一時不易發現、</p>
<h3>日競選失敗　果引起危機歟　紐約民聲講壇報之評論　小小風波亦頗値得注意</h3>
<p>哈瓦斯社十五日絲的電、上海公共租界工部局選舉董事結果，頃由紐約民聲講壇報加以評論云、日本方面、原望控制工部局而未獲如願以償、此後或將引起新的危機、上海公共租界選舉董事一事、雖如極小茶壺內之極小水面、但按之實際、或含有引起太平洋戰事之可能性、……日方發言人曾稱、必於明年搏得多數票、以故此際不妨靜待、但日本軍人、果能靜待至明年乎、以意度之、其第二步驟、殆係經由「南京政權」之手、向各條約國要求收回租界、果爾、則必遭英美兩國政府之拒絕、然則日本父將如何哉、此種風波、雖極微小、但此一茶壺、即太平洋之縮影也、職是之故、此種小風波、亦頗値得注意、」</p>
<p>須磨表示　非常驚駭</p>
<p>美國合衆社東京十五日電、日外務省發言人須磨彌吉郞今日聲稱、上海工部局選舉之結果、令彼大爲驚愕、謂當選舉之前夕、頗有許多可駭之事、如據稱公共租界某方面之投票數目、突然增加、即爲其一、</p>

<p>南方食稻，而以麥爲小食；北方食麥，而以黍糧爲小食。自黍以下，爲穀中粗品，稻麥二種，最爲精美。古者祭祀粢盛，兼用稷黍菽粱，以備五土之宜；而自古迄今，上下通食，播種獨多者，莫如稻麥若也。揚州之域，其穀官稻，而麥亦時種。北方之田，未必不宜稻，特以九河旣失道防，夏令亢暴，而父患秋汛決堤，皆有妨稻熟，若種麥即初夏已收，無慮乎此。故今北方皆以麥爲昆食，而雜蒔梁黍，以補不足，粱黍不成，亦無大碍，其實大下之土，五穀之生，無所不宜，即天下之人，五穀之食，亦無所不宜也。稻麥味皆甘平，稻則和中，麥則補中，二者之性，無大異處，今不識古書，不問遠俗之醫生，輒戒人以食麥，正不知其何所見也。將謂其功益氣乎，夫氣者，體之所受，體弱者，氣必不足，麥能益氣，正有功於氣虛之病，何以不可食也。彼則曰：（麥旣補中，則益氣，益氣之力在發生人身臓腑所受，積久皆病；或舊有病，不時當發，而麥之功，不啻引之至。旣病之人，體氣本虛，虛者能益之，固妙劑也，恐不能益，而更發其病，夫寗勿食之爲愈也．彼又曰：「北方地氣厚，人體結實，麥能益具氣；南方人體孱弱，麥適發其病也。」</p>

<p>教育</p>
<h3>家庭敎育比學校敎育重要</h3>
<p>— 周戊</p>
<p>普通一般人總以爲靑年犯罪的原因是爲了貧困，爲飢寒所迫而致；但是，事實上却不盡然。</p>
<p>最近美國某電影公司拍攝了一個短片，也證明了這一點。片子述雨美國某地的警務當局破獲了一樁竊盜的案件，所捕得的三個主犯却都是未成年的男孩子，而他們的家庭也都小康，過着安適的生活。然則，他們爲什麽要幹這竊盜的勾當呢？</p>
<p>這影片所給予我們的答稷是：家長們沒好好的關心他們的孩子。他們給兒子們穿暖了，吃飽了，就算已盡了責任。他們限本不留心孩子們在課餘空暇的時候做些什麼玩意兒消遺。最好是父母們應該陪子女消遺空暇的時候，做點有益的運動，游戲，或談話。但，可惜大多的父母把子女們當做畜養的貓狗，吃飽了，穿暖了，就算數，於是產生了這種種不好的後果。</p>
<p>由此，我們可以知道父母對於子女的責任是不僅在「給養」而巳，最要緊的還是在「敎育」。窮苦的父母雖然不能使子女過安樂舒滴的生活，但是却可以給良好的家庭敎靑興子女們，這對於子女們的得益却遠勝於財富。</p>
<p>報章雜誌上雖常載有靑年爲貧困所迫而犯罪的消息，但也不缺乏富家子弟不務尼業而走入歧路的事件。因此，貧困決不是靑年犯罪的惟一原因。</p>
<p>靑年是最易感染着不良習慣和趨入邪路的時期，因爲靑年人大多入世不深，判斷力比較薄弱。所以，爲父母的當子女們逐漸長大，行將成年之時，當吏注爲子女們的舉動，循循善誘，使國家未來之主人翁都走着光明的正路。</p>
<p>在中國，尤其在今日之上海，學校的敎育紙在懣智識，而對於敎導立身處世的責任是有待於父母們自己貧担起來的。</p>
<p>所以我說：家庭敎育比學校敎育更爲重要。</p>

<h3>每日的休假</h3>
<p>— 曹靈佑</p>
<p>處在這繁華的都市裏，生活是非常緊張的。東奔西走，僕僕風塵，經營角逐，腦筋已經够倦了。更兼周圍的環境，充滿了各種新奇的刺激。各人在家裏，更負荷了種種無謂的憂慮及煩惱。在這種情形之下，我們的精神健康是受着很大的打擊的！</p>
<p>據調查所得，都市的人易患神經衰弱，因爲我們的環境，實在太惡劣，但是各人因爲職業的關係，不能離開城市到鄉村去，行日出間作，日入而息的生活，因此我們必須想些方法，來調劑我們疲乏的頭腦，使不致陷於精神不建全的狀態。</p>
<p>因爲我們的生活太緊張，所以我們必須養成從容不迫的態度，更規定一種每日的休假。</p>
<p>每日的休假，時間是不需要很多的，十分鐘也好，二十分鐘也好。這每日的休假簡直比春假，寒假，及其他的例假來得軍要。我們須知勞苦的工作不會傷害人，只有不充足的休息會傷害人，每日的休假就是想在極緊張的生活中，得到片刻的休息。</p>
<p>能利用每日休假的人，不但能除去各種精神上的疾病，更能增加工作的效率。</p>
<p>美國巳故的老羅斯福總統是一位善於利用每日休假的人，他每天在極忙的生活中，找出十餘分鍊的時間，來看自己喜歡的詩集。有一位靑年，利用每餐飯前飯後的時間，來玩樂器，結果多得了一種技藝。還有一位靑年，利用中午飯後多餘的時間，往街中攝取各種景物，結果成了一位攝影專家</p>
<p>眞的，假如你是一位極其忙碌的人，那你更需要多些每日的休假，藉以調劑你那疲乏的頭腦，使它從新淸醒起來！</p>
<h3>人不如狗</h3>
<p>— 潘仲長作</p>
<p>隨筆</p>
<h3>自傳的重要</h3>
<p>— 胡洪基</p>
<p>幾天以前，很幸運地見到一位社會的長老。在九十分鐘的會晤中，他把他一生的思想和人生觀滔滔不絕地發揮了出來。其中有着許多可驚可喜的故事，也有許多足爲後一代人的敎訓的資料。</p>
<p>我勸道位老先生把他的自傳寫下來。可是他謙虛地說，『我不是甚麼了不起的人，我不喜歡自捧自吹。』</p>
<p>對於這一點，我是表示異議的。世界上固然有人利用自傳以作自我的宣傳，可是寫自傳的人並不一定都是如此，也不一定都要如此。因爲每個人都祇生活一回，所以人生實在是一種冒險，一種嘗試，一個實騐。在幾十年的生活中，我們有苦，有悲，有笑，有淚，有衷心的憾事，有慘痛的經騐與敎訓。有許多錯誤，我們是不願意再犯了，有許多悲劇我們是不希望重演了。我們在一生的苦闘與掙扎中，曾經得到不少寳貴的敎訓。這些敎訓是社會給我們的，所以我們應該把它們歸還給社會。我們不應該把它們像中國『古傳秘方』似地藏秘起來使社會蒙受一種無形的損失。我們要把這些敎訓，當做一種合理的遺產留傳給我們子孫，叫下一代的人，能够無代價地接納我們所得的敎訓，避免我們所犯的錯誤，過一種較好的生活。</p>
<p>我不但希望這位老先生把他的自傳寫下來，也希望每個認眞地過着忠實的生活的人，都有一本目傳遺留給他們的子孫。</p>
<p>人物</p>
<h3>卡奈基奮鬬史</h3>
<p>— 溫和</p>
<p>「交友秘訣」的作者台爾卡奈基巳經是世界名人了，他的口才的流利，使他成爲一僩頂好的演說家。可是他幼年時候的境遇，很不順利，他有今日的地位，全憑自己的奮鬥。</p>
<p>他出身農家，少年時在一所小城市的師範學校裏讀書。他立志要成爲一個出色的人物，他自知生得很瘦小，在運動塲上出人頭地，是完全沒有希望的。可是他曾在母親指導之下，有過很多决的背誦的經驗，他利用自己這一點的長處，加八了學校的辯諭隊。第一年中，他參加了好幾决辯論比賽，可是竟沒有一决不失敗。</p>
<p>他心頭懊喪之至。正在那個時候，他去聽一個暑期講習曾講師的演講。這位講師的樣子很闊氣，態度很大方，姿勢很純熟。他講的是一個貧苦鄉村小孩的故事，講得十分動人，很快的就抓住了聽衆的興趣。他說這個年孩有一度覺得自己的前途黯淡得很，想不到竟有一天會成功，會成爲一個受大家愛慕欽佩的人物。這個講師講到故事的頂點了，他對聽衆說道：「你們要問了，這個灰心的孩子是誰呢？諸位女士先生，你們現在所看着的就是他！」</p>
<p>卡奈基也坐在台下聽，他受着那位講師的魔了。這一次的演講，是他生平第一次聽到講得這樣津津有味的；而且這故事本身很可能就是他自己的故事。他現在想起道件事，印象仍舊還很深刻，他說：『我看見這個講師坐着火車，各處奔跑，住着旅館，帶了白硬領這樣的關氣；我又知道他一度也像我一樣的是個貧苦的鄕下小孩，我才自信我有一天也可以成功的。」</p>
<p>那决聽講以後，他參加校內辯論，就用了一種新的方法。他又用功背誦名家的演辭。他每天從農塲到學校的來回路程，都是騎了馬去的，他常常對了這匹馬，演講林肯的「蓋鐵斯繼演辭」和其他著名的演辭。他這樣的醉心演說，全校師生立刻就公認爲他是全校最好的演說家了。</p>
<p>師範學校畢業之後，他做過兩項生意，又想成爲一憫演員，可是他總究還是走演講這條老路。廿四歲的時候，他同紐約的靑年會接洽，想借他們的地方來辦一個演講訓練班。靑年會答應他的請求，可是他說每一决他要拿兩塊錢，靑年會就認爲這個數目太大了。他們答應了一個拆帳的辦法，他們悄願把總收入的百分之八十給卡奈基，他們以爲這個數目一定很小的，不料卡奈基開講之後，立刻大受歡迎，受訓的人很多。而且別處的靑年會也來要求他開演講訓練班了。兩年之後，他一禮拜的收入巳有五百元美金了。</p>
<p>靑年會的演講班奠定了卡奈基事業的基礎。「卡奈基會話交際學院」和他的「交友秘訣」的成功，在他少年時候已經下好種子了。</p>
<h3>地心的話</h3>
<p>— 陸安之</p>
<p>地球的平均密度是五·五，而地球表面的平均密度僅二·五，所以許多寳實的重金屬，如赤金，鎢，鐳等，皆蘊藏在地球中心。假使有一天，人類能够發掘地球中心的金屬，像現在開義一樣容易的話，則金塊的價値，將同普通的石塊一般低賤，世界上的金融市塲，難免起一次極劇烈的更動。</p>

<h3>王瑤卿述譚鑫培軼事</h3>
<p>— 燕五</p>
<p>五名伶之得以成名，必具有敏捷之思想，動作。在故都時，老供奉王瑤卿曾爲余言：當譚大王始成名時，同行中嫉之者甚衆，某鬚生尤甚。一日，某王府七王爺爲其太夫人祝壽。故都名伶咸被傳入府，演劇稱觴。譚大王及某鬚生亦與焉。某鬚生以爲使譚栽觔斗之機會已至，即懇求戲提調某，將己與譚大王排於同一戲碼；而又能在同一塲演出者。某並不知某鬚生之用意，乃將譚與某鬚生派演「草船借箭」，使譚大王飾孔明，某鬚生飾魯子敬。當演至孔明與子敬在船中飲酒一塲時，某鬚生突詢譚曰：「請問先生，天邊有白雲一朶，不知主何吉凶？」此，本係某鬚生所杜撰，劇中原無此白，蓋其意以爲驟然以此問之，譚必猝不能答，而觀衆亦必報以倒彩，如是，則某鬚生平時之嫉預，亦可稍洩矣。詎譚大王竟不慌不忙輕揮羽扇而答曰：「天機不可洩露，請大夫附耳過來。」乃在其耳邊低聲曰：「　你的祖宗。」某鬚生猶點首作勢曰：原來如此。」</p>
<h3>新梅蘿香觀後</h3>
<p>— 潔</p>
<p>「梅蘿香」是中國放行劇團第一個上演的戲。據唐槐秋說：這也是使他演得出色的一個戲。此次中旅繼「雷雨」「日出」把它重演，那不僅是爲了很可叫座，還有二點値得我人知道。</p>
<p>第一：這决已把「梅蘿香」改名爲「新梅蘿香」，在這時代，像梅蘿會那樣慧志薄弱的女性，不知有多多少少，然而走到墮落之路盡頭的時候，還能够回頭是岸，擺脫一切，毅然去找求獻身於國家的光明前程，那是不可多得的。梅蘿香最後自殺，經一老伶工的激勵，再造新主命，這就可說不是梅蘿香而是　梅蕪香。同時在這劇裏，劇作者又把馬子英的前進思想强調起來，這也是足以寳貴的。</p>
<p>第二：我們以前看到過的梅蘿香，那是唐若靑白楊等演的，「新梅蘿肖」却起用新人李靑來（在「阿Q正傳」中演出過）演梅蘿杳一角，又由另一新人藍靑演小春蘭，都是中旅新的嘗試。</p>
<p>「新梅蘿香」仍爲四幕，唐槐秋的白森卿，那副犴滑勢利姿態，確是全劇最出色的人物。而對於若干小動作，尤能襯托這種人物的個性，逼蘿香寫信與子英絕交，這一節是生動極了。與森卿站在相反地位的，便是前進靑年馬子英。子英一角出「明末遺恨」中的施汶飾演，剛毅熱情，俱有成功的演出，小春蘭穿挿得很好，在這一支動人的悲劇中，是不能缺少春蘭這類自作聰明的虛榮女性點綴着。藍靑的努力演戲，也博得觀衆的好評，至於梅蘿香的戲，十分吃重，要把意志薄弱的個性表演出來，而內心上充溢着熱情與創痛，又交織着矛盾與徬槐，這在李靑來第一决能演得相當洗煉動人，確是不可不讀許的。</p>
<p>全劇塲子較鬆的，該是　三幕的前半節，小春蘭來見梅蕪香，對白如能刪短，情緒更可緊湊起來，等到白森卿出塲，就漸漸掀起高潮，第一幕獨有一個高潮（子英與森卿的爭辯），那也是難得的。</p>
<p>令劇各人物的現實，對白的幽默有力，以及第三幕布景的富麗，要是從效果上再設法加以强調各幕情緒，確不失爲中旅成功劇本中的一個。</p>
<p>常的去照顧她，慧聰遇到什麼疑難的事情，也常去問他，於是他倆的友誼，就漸漸地進一步走到戀愛的階段。</p>
<p>在不久以前，慧聰的母親，父拗棄了女兒去世，祇剩下她孤苦伶仃一個弱女十，雖然還有叔父張嘯天和其他親戚，但究竟不比自己的親生父母，那末，找尋一個歸宿，是她急於要解決的一件事情。在這時候，她感到文魁對於她親切的安慰，更是使她傾心，就毅然決然地和文魁宜吿同居了。</p>
<p>記者爲這件事，曾到後台向雙方作一决訪問，慧聰似乎沒有脫女孩子害羞的天性，祇含着笑不肯表示什麼，文魁却坦白地說：以前因爲沒有到成熟的時期，所以對親友們仍保守着秘密，現在爲避免種種的讕言，况且也小是偷愉摸摸的事情，還不如正式公開一下來得痛快。我就問他是否要舉行一决同居的儀式，他爽直地回答說：那當然是要的！</p>
<p>說到這裏，他就上台去演戲，完畢上來，慧聽「在扮戲房等着他，卸裝以後，一同出了後台，樣子當然非常親熱，慧聽雖在一年之中，連遭兩次大故，但爲了這美滿的姻綠，心裏目然安慰得多了。</p>

<p>「戰太平」這齣戲，許多年來已淪爲掃邊老生的開鑼戲，此番貫大元搭入更新，我因爲他身材略短，面色蒼老，並且嗓音宜高不宜低，所以勸他多演靠把老生劇，而將穿靑稽子的一類戲少唱。更在報端先將「戰太平」的特點，詳述一過，故而當他頭一次貼演該劇時，雖僅上了個八成座，然而第二次再貼這戲時，居然連臺上都賣了百餘座位，後來還不斷有許多票界朋友專要煩他這戲，看看他飾華雲被擒時的「波浪鼓」怎樣翻法，以及那句「站的是你老爺將華雲」的老腔如何唱法，因爲這種翻與唱，都是近來一般譚派鬚生所辦不了的。大元潦倒多年，此番竟風頭十足，連演三月，而座不少衰，我想他的這齣「戰太平」也可以算是他的成名劇了。本來凡是一位名角，都要各有三兩齣拿手傑作，而這幾齣戲的優點，又能爲社會人士所周知，那就不愁沒有人歡迎了。譬如程硯秋的「紅拂傳」「六月雪」每演就得滿堂，這也就是因爲此兩劇是他先後馳譽歌壇，號爲程派名劇的緣故。最怕一個角兒，樣樣都能，樣樣都平平，恐怕唱、輩子戲，也難能走紅連的。</p>

<h3>British Navy Continues Victory: Landing in Narvik, Norway; Over Thirty German Warships and Transport Ships Lost; Pocket Battleship Admiral Hipper Also Sunk</h3>
<p>London - The Admiralty has just issued a communique stating that our troops have landed in the port of Narvik, northern Norway. (Havas dispatch, 15th) London - The Army and Navy jointly issued a communique in the morning, stating that British troops have landed at several locations on the coast of Norway. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>London - Regarding the battle situation in Narvik, northern Norway, although official sources here still refuse to release information, it is generally believed that the port has been recaptured by British forces. Under the protection of the British fleet, it will simultaneously become a base for both land and sea battles. Moreover, the port is close to the iron ore region of northern Sweden. If occupied by British forces, the German plan to invade Sweden will inevitably be hindered. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>London - A telegram from the capital of Sweden states that the British and French fleets are performing very well in the naval battle off Narvik, Norway, and German forces in the port have already been driven out. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>London - A naval communique announced that further reports from our submarines indicate that two more German transport ships have been sunk. In addition, an attack was carried out on a group of German transport ships in the Skagerrak, with four torpedoes hitting their targets. The communique also stated that yesterday, the British naval air force again attacked enemy transport ships and aircraft in the Bergen area. One transport ship caught fire, a small supply ship sank, and a large survey ship was strafed with machine-gun fire by British planes, catching fire and burning. One British plane returned to base safely. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Stockholm - When the German 26,000-ton battleship Gneisenau was sunk, it had a crew of 1,500 officers and men. As of now, excluding the "Admiral Hipper," the loss of German warships accounts for approximately 27% of the country's total naval tonnage. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>London - According to the "Daily Express," several armed British ships have been carrying an expeditionary force, following behind British warships, heading towards Narvik since Saturday. News from knowledgeable sources indicates that the expeditionary force numbers around 100,000. According to reports from neutral countries, after the British naval victory on Saturday, British and French troops arrived at Narvik. However, German sources claim that the British and French fleets are still out at sea. Official sources here neither confirm nor criticize these two reports. (United Press dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>London - Prime Minister Chamberlain will deliver a detailed statement to the House of Commons on April 16th regarding the British landing in Norway. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Stockholm - It has been reported from Berlin that the German ship sunk in the Oslofjord was one of Germany's most powerful warships, the Gneisenau, and not the cruiser Blücher. It has been definitively confirmed that Admiral Carls, commander of the German main battle fleet, and several high-ranking army and naval officers were forced to swim ashore after the ship sank, as these high-ranking officers only command the largest battleships. Berlin has not denied the Norwegian claim that the Gneisenau has already sunk. German authorities announced last week the loss of the 10,000-ton cruiser Blücher and the 6,000-ton cruiser Karlsruhe. It is reported that the Blücher was heavily damaged when it attempted to bombard Norwegian 11-inch caliber guns outside Oslo. The Blücher was only completed last year and was equipped with eight 8-inch guns and three aircraft. The Gneisenau, on the other hand, was one of the largest and most powerful ships in the German fleet. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>London - According to a communique issued by the British Admiralty, as a result of British naval operations in Norway last week, Germany has lost over thirty warships and transport ships in total. The German 10,000-ton pocket battleship Admiral Hipper, a sister ship to the Graf Spee, which scuttled itself in South American waters several months ago, was destroyed on Thursday morning by the British 670-ton submarine Swordfish. A German cruiser, presumably the 6,000-ton Karlsruhe, was torpedoed and sunk by the British ship Truant on Tuesday. The German side has now acknowledged the loss of this ship. In addition, on April 10th, two other unidentified German ships were also sunk. Furthermore, four other German ships under escort were also hit by torpedoes, but the results are unknown. The German ship Alster, 8,145 tons, has been captured by the British. Three large fishing boats have also been brought into British ports. On Wednesday, the British 2nd Destroyer Flotilla sank six German supply ships and the munitions-laden Ravensfeld outside Narvik. The German oil tanker Skagerrak, 6,044 tons, scuttled itself upon seeing the approach of British warships, as there was no escape. The German ship Maine was spotted by the Norwegian destroyer Traug and also scuttled itself. Its crew of approximately 60 men was rescued by the Norwegian ship and brought to a British port. The Norwegian ship Traug has now joined the Allied navy. It is reported that the German oil tanker Kattegat has been scuttled in the Skagerrak Strait by the Norwegians. The losses of German submarines have not yet been determined. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>British Navy Smashes Goebbels' Slogans</h3>
<p>Paris - News of the British Navy's resounding victories in Narvik has been met with jubilation throughout France. All Parisian newspapers have published this news on the front page in large characters. The general sentiment is, "If Nelson knew, he would be overjoyed in the afterlife." Official commentary suggests that "the British Navy has smashed all of Goebbels' slogans in a matter of hours." A semi-official statement elaborates on the strategic importance of British operations in the North Sea and Baltic Sea, stating that the German attempt to seize Norwegian ports has proven to be a major mistake. The Allies can now operate freely in the North Sea without hindrance. The British Navy has demonstrated that Hitler's habitual attacks are merely hollow threats when met with initial resistance. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>British Air Force Bombards Stavanger Airfield; German Plane Crashes in Sweden</h3>
<p>London - The Air Ministry announced that British planes again flew low at dawn to attack the Stavanger airfield and hangars, damaging several enemy aircraft. British planes also flew over Hafrsfjord, strafing several enemy seaplanes on the water with machine guns and destroying one enemy machine-gun post. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>London - Swedish radio reports that a German three-engine plane crashed on a hillside after flying over the town of Uddevalla near Gothenburg, Sweden, and caught fire. It is also reported that a Junkers German plane was forced to land in western Sweden earlier. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Stockholm - An official communique has just been released stating that a German plane flew over our town of Uddevalla (south of the Norwegian border) into our airspace. Local anti-aircraft batteries first fired a warning shot, but the German plane continued flying, so they opened fire and hit it, causing it to catch fire and crash. The pilot died on the spot. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Berlin - According to a local Berlin newspaper, German Air Attaché Captain Spierer was indeed killed in action in Oslo. (Haitong dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>The Hague - A British bomber was shot down this afternoon during a battle with German planes over Germany and crashed in the town of Abele (near the Dutch border). (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>London - An Air Ministry communique announced that last night, Coastal Command reconnaissance planes continued to attack the Stavanger airfield. Despite darkness and heavy rain, British planes dropped many incendiary bombs on the field and strafed ground defenses with machine guns. The British planes encountered heavy anti-aircraft fire but sustained no losses. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Mines Laid at Entrance to Baltic Sea</h3>
<p>Berlin - Berlin Radio announced that the entrances to the Baltic Sea have been mined in two locations: one in the Great Belt Strait between 55 degrees 17 and 55 degrees 22 north latitude, and the other in the Little Belt between 9 degrees 47 and 9 degrees 51 east longitude. A line east of 55 degrees 33.9 north latitude, 9 degrees 47 east longitude and 55 degrees 36.1 north latitude, 9 degrees 51 east longitude has also been mined. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>German Troops Reinforce Trondheim; Railway Line East of Narvik Blown Up; 3,000 Norwegian Soldiers Retreat into Sweden and are Detained</h3>
<p>Stockholm - The Norwegian government has just issued a communique stating that German troops have departed from Oslo to reinforce Trondheim. According to news from the Norwegian border, German troops, after occupying the city of Halden, also occupied the town of Krossjesier and took over the customs office there. Norwegian troops have now retreated to a location 20 kilometers from the Swedish border. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Stockholm - According to border news obtained by newspapers, Norwegian forces have blown up the railway line from Narvik to Luleå, cutting off the transport of German troops within Narvik. It is reported that German troops have occupied Sarpsborg, southeast of Oslo, which is located on the Glomma River. It is also reported that Halden, near the Swedish border, surrendered without a fight, and over a hundred German soldiers entered the city in trucks. German troops have retreated near Eidsvold, so Kongsvinger is temporarily safe. According to its reporters, the Norwegian front line is gradually taking concrete form due to the efforts of Norwegian officers returning from the Finnish front. German troops are very well equipped; when their first transport ships arrived in Oslo, light tanks and several heavy artillery pieces were unloaded. According to reports, German troops are now sweeping away resistance and advancing rapidly towards the Swedish border. Naval battles have been ongoing for a week on the west coast of Norway, while German troops on land are now crossing Lake Mjøsa from Oslo towards Charlottenberg. German heavy bombers continue to attack Elverum, killing over fifty people. After continuing to land in Oslo, German troops immediately set out east. Guerilla warfare is still taking place between Kongsvinger and Halden, not far from the Norwegian-Swedish border. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Paris - The German military authorities in the occupied areas of Norway have issued an order stating that any Norwegian who dares to answer the government's call to arms will be immediately executed upon capture. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Stockholm - Three hundred Norwegian soldiers, after fighting German troops southeast of Oslo, have crossed the border between Halden and Gothenburg into Swedish territory and have been detained by Swedish authorities. It is also known that fighting is still ongoing east of Kongsvinger, and the city is still in the hands of Norwegian troops. German planes have flown over Swedish airspace, and two have been shot down near the Swedish border by British and French planes. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Stockholm - Regarding the war in Norway, local newspapers recently reported that the German front has now expanded to the south of Aurskog, and Eidsvoll fell at 2:00 AM this morning. Norwegian troops stationed in Elverum have automatically withdrawn, crossing the Vorma River and defending the high ground. There is no confirmation on the current situation. Fierce fighting occurred near Ski near Gjøvik yesterday, but the number of German troops involved was very small. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Paris - Military sources here have recently stated that the course of the Norwegian war over the past 24 hours has been similar in nature to the previous day, namely, a type of "road war." German troops are attempting to advance along transportation lines from the Oslo area directly into the heart of Norway, allegedly to obstruct the country's mobilization plans and to establish contact with German troops landing in various locations on the west coast of Norway. On the Norwegian side, they have stepped up defenses at key locations, such as bridges, forests, passage entrances, and roads along lakes. At the same time, the Norwegian mobilization plan, under the command of the Norwegian General Staff, is proceeding exceptionally quickly. The country's air force and the remaining fleet have also begun to attack the enemy. This can be seen in yesterday's downing of several German planes by the Norwegian air force and the pursuit of the ship "Dahlak" to intercept German cargo ships on the west coast, forcing them to scuttle themselves. The British air force's three bombings of the Stavanger airfield are of even greater significance. After the third bombing, the German side can hardly make use of this airfield anymore. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Stockholm - According to local official sources, German troops in Norway have advanced to the Karnesjøs customs station near the Norwegian-Swedish border, south of Halden. The railway from Oslo to Trondheim also passes through this area. (Haitong dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Two German Ships Scuttle Themselves</h3>
<p>London - The German oil tanker "Skagerrak" (6,040 tons) encountered a British cruiser somewhere at sea and immediately scuttled itself. The German ship "Mena" (7,624 tons) encountered a Norwegian destroyer off the coast of Norway and also scuttled itself. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Swedish-Finnish Volunteers Fighting in Norway</h3>
<p>London - According to news from the Swedish capital, the Norwegian General Headquarters has just announced that Swedish and Finnish volunteers have arrived at the front lines to participate in the war. In addition, the Norwegian Naval Headquarters announced that a total of three German planes were shot down today, and all the pilots have been captured. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Development of the European Situation and Italy</h3>
<p>European turmoil has moved in many directions throughout the world due to Germany's invasion of Scandinavia. Although the fierce war is limited to a corner of Northern Europe, and the goal is also limited to the Norwegian coast, these situations are by no means the essence or the full picture of the so-called second stage of the European war. It is only a preliminary stage. What the preliminary stage shows about the second stage is only that the scope of the war is expanding, and the status of neutral countries is becoming more difficult. They can no longer continue their previous ambiguity and are forced to clarify their position. If they do not join the German side, they must join the British and French side. Not only does the environment no longer allow them to hesitate, but time also does not allow them to waver. In short, Western European countries like the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg are in this situation, as are Balkan countries like Romania, Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Greece. Even Italy, the leader of Southern Europe, must be in this situation. It is easier for small countries to be invaded, and their reactions and displays of attitude are as quick as an echo. For example, Norway, although initially more tolerant of Germany and more serious towards Britain and France, quickly became an ally of Britain and France due to its resistance to Germany. As for neutral great powers, their strength is stronger, their position is more important, their past history and current environment are more complex, their political color is stronger, and their national aspirations are more ambitious. On the belligerent side, they naturally see neutral small countries as easier to deal with, but they must treat great powers differently due to various considerations. It is not easy to make them submit through threats, nor is it easy to satisfy them through temptations. In the seven months since the start of the European war, in addition to military action, the belligerent countries have engaged in intense struggles on all fronts of international politics, economics, and diplomacy, all under various pretenses, to try and win over the larger neutral countries. History does not repeat itself. We cannot portray the various events of the First World War and apply them to the present situation. Recalling those years, it was a major war from the beginning, not like this time's deeply entrenched trench warfare. Therefore, the strength of both belligerent sides can be said to have been completely undiminished after seven months of fighting. Both belligerent sides are engaged in war, treating each other with caution, not gambling with strength, but only gambling with time. Therefore, if we examine the battlefield, after seven months of stalemate, who is winning and who is losing is still a complete unknown. Italy's attitude is also different from the First World War. At the beginning of the war, it declared that it would not participate on either side, but at the same time, it made various gestures and expressions, showing its readiness to join the war at any time. This is a great mystery under the sky, and no one can determine the answer!</p>
<p>If these expressions and gestures are not false, it shows that Italy wants to stay out of it; but its wavering and ambiguity do not mean that it claims to be completely impartial. Since the beginning of the war, its rhetoric has been quite extraordinary, and its actions have not been weak. The fascist leader has repeatedly announced to his people to be ready for battle, and his diplomatic machinations in the Balkans show that he is adhering to his policies. Its rhetoric, its actions, and its policies are distinctly different from neutrality, and clearly show the world that it is leaning towards Germany, its Axis partner. The reason for this is not unexpected, because Italy's foreign policy actually has four cornerstones: First, Italy's alliance with Germany was never completely sound, but rather lopsided. Therefore, there was no obligation to help Germany in the war, but in order to deal with the international situation, Italy still believed that maintaining the status quo was more beneficial. Therefore, it maintained close ties with Germany while maintaining a "reserved" attitude towards the war. Second, Italy is waiting for the most favorable opportunity to arrive, in order to achieve its wishes in one fell swoop. In analyzing its wishes, some contradict Germany, while others require concessions from Britain and France. Third, German leader Hitler is well aware of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's wishes and attitude. Hitler is confident that Germany's victory over Britain and France does not depend on Italy's assistance, as long as Italy does not help Britain and France. Therefore, Germany expects less and hopes for more from Italy. Therefore, Italy does not plan to fight desperately, but is only preparing to shed the least amount of blood at the final moment of victory and achieve the greatest success. Fourth, although Italy's national strength is strong, it is inferior to Britain, France, and Germany. If it tries to catch up in peacetime, it is difficult to hope to catch up. However, when war breaks out, it is a period of mutual attrition for the belligerent countries, and a period of construction for Italy, which is also the best opportunity to bring its national strength on par. These four cornerstones have led Italy to adopt the attitude it has taken for the past seven months. However, the international situation and the evolution of the war have made Italy not want to remain a bystander for much longer.</p>
<p>If it does not remain a bystander, then what? Yesterday, a telegram from the Italian capital reported that Ansaldo, the manager of the "Telegraph News," the newspaper of Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, suddenly delivered a radio address to the Italian army, saying:</p>
<p>"Italy is waiting for the most profitable opportunity to participate in the European war. He believes that after the outbreak of the war in Northern Europe, no country can avoid the disaster of war. It is a great mistake for the Italian people to fantasize that Italy can ultimately avoid participating in the war, or to fantasize that Italy only needs to seek foreign exchange profits. Small countries like Norway can barely avoid being drawn into the vortex of war, let alone Italy, which is a neighbor of the belligerent countries and has various interests in the Mediterranean. How can it avoid participating in the war? Italy has strengthened its military preparations and is waiting for an opportunity that is beneficial to Italy. This opportunity seemed remote a month ago, but it is now imminent. We should not only prepare for war materially, but also mentally, in preparation for a war that may break out in one or two weeks."</p>
<p>This is a reaction to the development of the European war to Northern Europe, and a step forward after the preliminary stage of the second phase of the European war. But which direction are Italy's cannons pointing? The speech did not give anyone a clue, not to mention that moving forward and turning around are both common and easy movements for any team! There was also a rumor yesterday, claiming that:</p>
<p>"According to Balkan diplomatic circles last night, Prime Minister Mussolini has concentrated his fleet at the entrance of the Dardanelles, near the Dodecanese Islands. This new naval mobilization by Italy is considered to be part of the Rome-Berlin Axis strategy, which is believed to have been discussed by the leaders of Germany and Italy at the Brenner Pass meeting last month. At the same time, it is claimed that Prime Minister Mussolini is preparing to mobilize 1.25 million reservists in an attempt to crush the mutual assistance treaty between the Allies and Turkey."</p>
<p>This explains the direction, but it is highly suspicious, because the telegram was broadcast by the American United Press, the source of the telegram was London, England, the news was based on so-called Balkan diplomatic circles, and the target of the transmission was the Dardanelles. Because of all of this, who can get to the bottom of it?</p>
<p>The news about Italy cannot be ignored or disregarded because of Italy's international position in Europe. Besides, Italy really has no intention of remaining a bystander for long. What should be recognized separately is that a newspaper manager's speech is not the same as a government order, and a broadcast to the army is not the same as a declaration to the international community. Orders and declarations are truly the forte of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano, his son-in-law. The current war in Northern Europe has indeed alarmed Italy, and the news from Italy can certainly alarm the belligerent countries, such as Italy's expression at this time that it is not satisfied with foreign exchange profits. But the meaning behind this action is not an attack or surrender. The Italian army, navy, and air force have the power to launch an offensive, but their defenses cause the Italian authorities to deliberate carefully. Therefore, even if Italy is preparing to take action in the war, it will never rashly decide the direction of its offensive based on the four cornerstones of its foreign policy, but will have to decide its direction based on its army, navy, and air force defenses. The claim that Italy is preparing for a war that may break out in one or two weeks can be temporarily seen as the outcome of the war in Northern Europe being decided in one or two weeks. One or two weeks is truly a fleeting moment in history, and this is an annotation of Italy's desire not to remain a bystander for long.</p>

<h3>Moviegoers Arrested at Ping'an Roman Theater</h3>
<p>Beiping: A new "Roman Theater" has been established near Dongjiaominxiang (Embassy District) in Beiping City, operated by an Italian.

Italian sailors at the scene dispersed the police. However, before the evening show, Chinese police suddenly arrived with several Japanese military police and arrested several theater staff and 50 moviegoers.

<h3>Japan Built a Large Airfield on Hainan Island Capable of Accommodating 1,600 Aircraft for Expanding Its Influence in the South Seas</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Following reports that Japan may take advantage of the European war to seize the Dutch East Indies, Chinese officials are closely watching developments in the South Pacific. The "Saodang Daily" published an editorial on this matter, stating that foreign countries with interests in the Pacific should pay serious attention to this matter. The European war is closely related to the Sino-Japanese war. China must now intensify its war of resistance to prevent Japan from transferring troops to expand into the South Pacific. At the same time, all countries should not only actively assist China, but also protect their own interests in the Pacific. According to well-informed Chinese sources, the Japanese have built a large airfield on Hainan Island capable of accommodating 1,600 aircraft. This preparation by the Japanese is clearly not for fighting against China, but for expanding their influence in the South Pacific. (Reuters dispatch of the 15th)</p>
<h3>Relief Commission Orders Henan to Handle Industrial Relief</h3>
<p>Luoyang: The Central Relief Commission believes that to relieve refugees, industrial relief should be promoted.

<h3>Japanese Political Offensive Soviet Newspaper Continues Commentary</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Moscow News: Soviet newspapers continue to comment on Japan's political offensive. The Moscow Bolshevik newspaper commented (Japan's Puppet Stage), stating that after years of painful struggle, Japan has actually staged its puppet show on the Chinese stage, which proves that the theater group is encountering great difficulties. The war expenses consumed by Japan in China have emptied the national treasury, and Japan's national economy has suffered the greatest blow as a result. After 33 months of war against China, the number of Japanese casualties has reached 1.5 million. Although the Japanese side regards the war against China as a (historical mission), the Japanese government cannot explain to the people of the whole country why it is necessary to make such sacrifices. Recently, more than 3,000 people in Japan have been arrested for anti-war activities. The other side of Japan's inner heart can be seen from this. Japan now places great hope on Wang Jingwei because Japan hopes to use him to save Japan's crisis. Wang's administrative program was formulated in Tokyo. The outline of the program is the same as what Doihara advocated. It is not known whose handwriting it is. (Dispatch of the 15th)</p>
<h3>Japan Holds Emergency Cabinet Meeting to Discuss Future of Dutch East Indies; Tokyo Newspaper Opposes Protection by Britain and the United States; British and Japanese Foreign Ministers Meet with Dutch Envoys</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Prime Minister Yonai held talks with Foreign Minister Arita at his official residence at 11:00 AM on the 15th, listening to his report on the situation in Northern Europe and the current situation of the focus of work in the Netherlands.

The participants were the cabinet ministers below Prime Minister Yonai (excluding the two ministers Fujiwara and Yoshida who were traveling). After Yonai and Arita reported in detail on the current European situation, they stated that if the flames of war spread to the Netherlands, Japan would still adhere to the policy of non-intervention in the European war, but in the Pacific, the relationship with the Dutch East Indies would inevitably be of great concern. After discussion among the cabinet ministers, it was unanimously agreed that the Japanese government should still adhere to the policy of non-intervention in the European war, but should try its best to avoid the spread of the war to the Pacific. Therefore, the Japanese government will issue a statement of "Non-intervention and Peaceful Defense of the Pacific" within days, and at the same time issue this instruction to overseas envoys to clarify Japan's policy to various countries.

<p>Tokyo: Several newspapers here discussed yesterday what would happen to the fate of the Dutch East Indies if Britain dragged the Netherlands into the war. The newspapers speculated that British Ambassador to Japan Craigie had explained to Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki the attitude that Britain would take towards the Dutch East Indies. According to the "China and Foreign Business News", Britain may have the possibility of controlling the Dutch East Indies, but at the same time it guarantees that it will not affect Japan's trade. The "Tokyo Asahi Shimbun" reported that the fate of the Dutch East Indies will have the following two possibilities: (1) Britain will control or protect the Dutch East Indies on the grounds that it is adjacent to Singapore; (2) If the Dutch government flees to the Dutch East Indies, it will be protected by the United States. The "Kokumin Shimbun", which has close ties with the military, claimed that whether Britain or the United States occupied the Dutch East Indies, it would be a threat to Japan, and Japan could not allow the islands to be a base for Britain or the United States to advance eastward.

<h3>Swedish National Socialist Party's Conspiracy to Launch Uprising Fails Swedish Authorities Take Strict Precautions</h3>
<p>Paris: Well-informed sources here recently said that the Swedish government had received information that the country's National Socialist Party planned to launch an uprising on the evening of the 11th of this month. The party's various groups had received orders to occupy all the important strongholds of Sweden at the same time. The government immediately took various preventive measures, and the National Socialist Party's conspiracy failed. Swedish Prime Minister Hansson said in a broadcast speech to the nation on the 12th of this month, "We must closely monitor the staff who work for foreign countries," referring to this matter.

<p>Stockholm: Observers here generally believe that the troops that Germany has concentrated in Denmark since the 9th of this month originally intended to attack Sweden, which will resolutely resist. Germany's current control of Denmark is similar to the protectorate it has established in the Czech Republic, but the German troops have orders to avoid cruel acts, which is the difference. All deposits of foreigners in Denmark have been confiscated, and permits are required to purchase goods. At present, food is decreasing day by day. In the future, various raw materials needed for agriculture in the country will not be imported, and the food situation of the people will become more serious. In short, if the military preparations of Denmark and Norway were more substantial, and they were determined to aid Finland at that time, they would not be invaded at this time. However, although the Scandinavian countries are fraternal states, their close relations are limited to cultural aspects and have no concrete foundation. Before being invaded, Denmark had already felt uneasy and asked Sweden for help, but the Swedish authorities replied that what the country feared was the Soviet Union, not Germany. This situation of sleeping in the same bed with different dreams is enough to lead wolves into the house. (Havas dispatch of the 14th)</p>

Seven people hid in a house. At dawn, the Algerian rapid-fire soldiers entered the village to search, and the seven surrendered. The recent Western Front war report of the French side stated that the enemy infantry west of the Voss district River used the cover of the artillery team to attack the French positions, but were wounded and retreated.

<h3>The Soviet Union Will Not Attack Sweden If Germany Invades Sweden It May Intervene</h3>
<p>Paris: The attitude of the Soviet Union towards the war in Northern Europe has recently been commented on by observers here, who said that the country will not attack Sweden for a while. This can be seen from the fact that Germany abides by the peace treaty between Finland and the Soviet Union, and the Red Army in the Bega-Momo port area of Finland will be withdrawn on schedule. However, if German troops do invade Sweden, the Soviet Union will send troops to intervene and share a piece of the pie. As for France and Britain, they will not take hostile actions against the Soviet Union, but if the Soviet Union sends troops to aid Germany, France and Britain will regard it as an enemy country and treat it as they would treat Germany.

Our country is now in a situation where even I and the Crown Prince and the government authorities do not know where we will be tomorrow.

<h3>US Newspaper Advocates Taking Over Greenland; No Country in the Western Hemisphere Can Tolerate Conquest by Another Country</h3>
<p>Chicago – Colonel Knox, the Republican candidate in the 1936 election and manager of the "Chicago Daily News," recently published an article in that newspaper arguing that the American "Monroe Doctrine" should be extended to Danish-owned Greenland. During the current European war, Greenland should be temporarily handed over to the Canadian Federation or the Dominion of Newfoundland for merger. The United States should cooperate in this matter. If not, the United States should take over sovereignty of the island until the end of the European war. In addition, Major Eliot, a military affairs reporter for the "New York Herald Tribune," published an article in that newspaper stating, "The United States cannot tolerate any European country ceding any land it currently holds in the Western Hemisphere to any non-American country, or being conquered by a non-American country, or any non-American country establishing new naval, land, or air bases in the Western Hemisphere. It is time to clearly state this position to all countries in the world.

Shipping sources reported today that the "Panama" had already turned out of the San Bernardino Strait via the American Pacific coast.

<h3>War Threatens US Interests: US Newspaper Discusses Northern European War</h3>
<p>London – According to special dispatches from here, New York newspapers reported the news of German destroyers being destroyed in Narvik as the most important news. The New York Times stated that the existence of this country depends on the outcome of the war around Norway is not only for the belligerent countries. Every neutral country, no matter how far from Europe, and no matter how determined it is to stay out of the war, must reassess its position in light of the outcome of Germany's advance. Germany will not hesitate to launch this attack if it gains a strategic advantage by defeating any neutral country. This fact is now clear. The New York Tribune stated that the war is approaching us day by day. The fate of Greenland now brings the war to our doorstep. If the Netherlands is invaded, the fate of the Dutch island of Curaçao and the West Indies will extend the war to within a stone's throw of the American Panama defense zone. Today is like 1917. People think of war and are afraid, but today the threat of war to the United States is greater than the victory of the United States and the defeat of Germany. The United States will undoubtedly face the possibility that it will only be able to protect its own interests by being forced to join the war. (Reuters, 15th)</p>

<h3>Britain Continues to Requisition American Dollar Securities</h3>
<p>London – On February 18, the British government issued an order to requisition 60 types of American securities held by British citizens. Now, it has ordered that 117 types of American dollar securities issued by 108 American companies must be transferred to the control of the British Treasury. This does not mean that all of the previously requisitioned securities have been sold. The Treasury has no intention of selling the American securities it has obtained on the market. The Treasury's principle is not to disrupt the American market. If American banks and trust companies cannot immediately absorb the sold securities, the British authorities will sell them later, waiting for Wall Street to have sufficient absorptive capacity. Financial circles say that if Wall Street's business activities can absorb the American securities sold by Britain, there will be no difficulty. Some of the securities requisitioned by the British government this time are collateral bonds, which are different from those requisitioned last time. American Steel common stock, Chrysler Motors common stock, and New York Central Railroad common stock are also included in this requisition. It is expected that the British government will continue to issue orders to requisition other types of securities at any time. (Reuters, 15th)</p>

<h3>Central Museum Studies Prehistoric Culture in Dali</h3>
<p>(Kunming Correspondence) The National Central Museum, in addition to collecting folk customs data in Xikang, discovered a total of 17 ancient tombs and 12 ancient sites in Dali, Yunnan, in 1928. Among them, seven belong to the prehistoric period, and five belong to the Nanzhao period. Five sites have been excavated, of which three belong to the prehistoric period. The work is relatively detailed.</p>
<p>The prehistoric culture of Dali includes five periods. There are stone tools in each period, and the shape changes very little. The pottery of each period has its own characteristics. The characteristic of the pottery in the first period is red sandy pottery with impressed patterns on the surface. The pottery in the second period is the same as in the first period, but the patterns are more complex. The third period is black sandy pottery, sometimes with patterns. Red sandy pottery was popular again in the fourth period, but the epidermis has a layer of red coating and is polished brightly. The fifth period is rope-patterned pottery made by stamping. Comparing the prehistoric culture of Dali with the Yangshao and Longshan cultures of North China, they have both similarities and differences. The three types of stone tools: axes, chisels, and planes, as well as rectangular stone knives, are very similar. However, the crescent-shaped stone knife produced in Dali is close to a bow shape, with the blade opening on the back of the bow, which is not found in North China. The forms and methods of making pottery bowls and basins are similar to those of Yangshao pottery. From the third period onwards, there are utensils similar to beans, cooking utensils with pointed feet, and tripods, all of which are commonly found in North China. The rope-patterned pottery made by stamping in the fifth period is exactly the same as that produced in North China. However, fragments of pottery with stamped intermittent patterns are common in Dali, which are not found anywhere in North China except Gansu. The prehistoric culture of Dali has its own characteristics, so it can form a system. Although the Yangshao and Longshan cultures of North China have both similarities and differences, they also have considerable relations with other ancient Chinese cultures. The museum has set up a working station in Dali, which is presided over by Mr. Wu Jinding, to handle excavation matters. In addition, Ms. Zeng Zhaogiong and Mrs. Wu assisted in the research. Most of the workers used in the excavation work last year were women, which is only seen in the history of archeology.</p>
<h3>Opening of Fujian University</h3>
<p>President Qiu Encourages Students to Study Hard</p>
<p>(Yong'an Correspondence) After completing the registration procedures for new students on March 28 and 29, Fujian Provincial Fujian University opened on the 1st of this month. That day happened to be the National Monthly Meeting and Commemorative Week. A Commemorative Week was held in the school's auditorium. All teachers and students attended and participated. President Qiu Hanping presided and led the ceremony. He then gave a speech on the school's purpose and his hopes for the students, saying that people generally like to recall the past and imagine the future, but they miss the present. In fact, the present is the necessary stage for the past and the future. Without the present, there is no past or future. The present is the most precious. All students should seize it, make full use of it, and enjoy it. The Fujian Provincial Government believes that the War of Resistance must build the country, and building the country must cultivate talents. In view of the lack of legal, agricultural, and medical talents in the province and the relationship between academic research and local characteristics, it spares no effort to operate this university regardless of the current difficult environment. Its expectations for the students of the school are extremely deep, especially those of Chairman Chen and everyone else are even more earnest. He hopes that everyone can do the following six things: (1) Implement a new life, (2) conscientiously study knowledge, (3) respect teachers and be friendly to friends, (4) serve the country and society, (5) cultivate a spirit of perseverance, and (6) love things and practice labor service. Throughout history, among the 450 million compatriots in our country, very few have received higher education. All students are now able to study here, under the guidance of good professors, and their expenses are jointly borne by the 13 million compatriots in this province. This is really a unique advantage. Therefore, I personally hope that everyone can make full use of the present opportunity, conscientiously study knowledge, develop good habits, and do their best to serve their hometown after graduation. Don't think for yourself, otherwise you will be letting down the government and the cultivation of the compatriots in this province. Then, he led the National Monthly Meeting, explained the outline of Chapter 5 of the Spiritual Mobilization, reported current events, and instructed the students to go to the countryside to lead the people to hold monthly meetings, so as to achieve the true effect of spiritual mobilization. Finally, he introduced the professors. In addition to Provost Wu Zhifang, the newly hired professors are Professor and Head of the Accounting Department Chen De, Business Mathematics Lecturer and Director of General Affairs Huo Sihua, Economics Professor Fu Zhida, History Professor Shen Lianzhi, Mathematics and Physics Professor Shi Yanhan, and Lecturer Qian Zongqi.</p>

The substantial rise in gold prices has exceeded the tightness of the US dollar. According to today's US dollar settlement, it was only 110 yuan lower, which is rare. Although the exchange rate rose in the morning, and the US dollar was quoted , the market had more good news, resulting in a better opening of 10 yuan, at 5,660 yuan. The market was still firm. Certain money changers and bank gangs mutually unloaded, immediately dropping 15 yuan. Originally, yarn operators had unwavering expectations. There were many rumors in the market, such as the possibility of the country entering the war, the dangerous prospects of the European situation, and a Western newspaper published that a certain foreign bank was about to be established with the aim of issuing banknotes. The problem of the seizure of silver in Tianjin was also rumored. At the same time, the exchange rate was recovering and tightening, and buying sentiment arose from all sides. First, gold shops and securities gangs aggressively advanced. Among them, because a certain money changer sold, there was a slight pause, but in the end, the sharp momentum was difficult to resist for long.

The market opened with an increase of 10 yuan, and gold shops entered 30 taels of silver into banks, at 5,660 yuan. Later, because the US dollar's loosening trend remained, a certain money changer took the lead in selling, and silver shops also slightly sold, resulting in a decrease of 15 yuan. The money changer sold 20 taels to gold shops, at 5,645 yuan. However, because people's expectations were high, retail buying sentiment rose again. At this time, the US dollar suddenly reported a tightening trend, and people's hearts were even more excited. Securities gangs, gold shops, and bank gangs competed to grab first, and soon rose again by 40 yuan. Gold shops entered 50 taels of silver into banks, at 5,685 yuan.

It fell back by 40 yuan, and securities gangs sold dozens of taels to banks, at 5,760 yuan. Then another securities gang's buying intention revived, and a certain money changer also came to delay, and then rose to 5,790 yuan again. After entering, gold shops and retail investors took profits and unloaded, and the army slightly fell back. Gold shops sold 20 taels to securities, at 5,774 yuan as the evening closing price.

The opening of US dollar bills was slightly retreated to 16 yuan and 45 cents. Later, there were many rumors in the market about silver deposits in Tianjin, and there was also news that a certain foreign bank would be established.

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market, the HSBC listed price was flat, and the spot British exchange rate in the black market maintained. Apart from HSBC supplying and closing hundreds of thousands of pounds still flat, the futures and US dollar were consistently tightening, which was due to many rumors unfavorable to sellers. If Italy in the European situation also joins the Allied forces in the war, and there is a desire to establish a bank to issue "paper money" and destroy legal tender, and the problem of silver in Tianjin has reached the final stage, all make the buyers fearless. Fortunately, American banks such as Citibank sold more than 500,000 US dollars, so the tightening trend was not too great. The transaction was booming. Since the morning, the exchange rate between the US and British currencies has indeed rebounded by 3.875, resulting in a flat opening for the British currency and a loosening of the US dollar to 6.065. Huashang Bank took the lead in selling, and the hardest May futures US dollar was 5.84375. However, soon people with strength came to dump and Huashang Bank speculators Hong Kong Electric Japanese banks and other fiercely dumped, and the market situation gradually softened.

<h3>Yarn and Flowers: Cotton Yarn Bulls are Drunk and Mad, and Double Horses are Lifted to 1,400 Yuan, and There are Daily Rumors of Empty Households Running Aground</h3>
<p>The yarn market rose, and the rising trend became more intense. This situation is very terrifying, but the enthusiastic atmosphere in the market is still brave, jumping every day, with a strong sense of endless rise. However, the current internal chip turnover is tighter, and the actual sales are sluggish. Once the spot goods loosen, the reaction afterwards must be guarded against. Generally, stockpilers are still absorbing strongly.</p>
<p>The current opening of the yarn market was that the British and American exchange rates increased, and the foreign cotton was also weak, but the popularity remained tense, and the buying sentiment was strong. The 20-count double horse factory order increased by 1,325 yuan.

<p>According to the recent situation of cotton yarn, the dramatic rise is unprecedented. In the past two days, it has been jumping step by step, and two major levels have been broken out, first rising through 1,300 yuan, and then yesterday breaking out of 1,400 yuan. However, although the rising trend is fierce, there are rumors that the shorts are unable to support those who run aground, and more and more families are going bankrupt. The certain yarn market is even more unstable, and judging from the unloading situation, the bulls are also ready to give up. Because if it rises wildly, earning money, I am afraid I will not be able to get it.</p>
<h3>Factory Offices Turn Smooth, Cotton Prices Higher</h3>

<p>In addition, the market price of foreign cotton in New York cotton market was very calm yesterday. Due to the on-market selling of the southern gangs and a part of the limited-price selling, the market situation slightly recovered. As a result, the closing price was 2-3 pounds lower than the previous day. Indian cotton towels were also affected by the European situation. Yesterday's daily forecast fell by 3 rupees, and Egypt fell by 10 pounds.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign cotton trading in Shanghai was due to the high price of yarn, the shrinkage of the exchange rate, the expansion of the silent situation, and the difficulty of transporting Indian cotton. The peers searched for spot goods on the market quite fiercely, especially for the raw materials for spinning 20-count yarns. There was a concern that there was no cotton to buy. The factory's import stomach was very strong, and at present, it can only order futures. Japanese manufacturers are also very active. The price of the US dollar at 6 yuan to convert to the factory price yesterday is as follows:</p>
<p>20-count American Mitteline 290.25</p>
<p>20-count American Mitteline Lower Grade 280.00</p>
<p>32-count American Mitteline 306.30</p>

<h3>Piece Goods: Cloth Prices Rise Without a Day of Interruption</h3>
<p>The cloth market is rumored to be expanding in the European war, the yarn price is soaring, and the buying sentiment is strong in the market. The opening price of each cloth in the morning has risen, and the fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth have increased by 5 cents to 1 yuan per piece. The market in the afternoon is tighter and continues to rise by about 1 yuan. The bleached and dyed cloth has risen by 1 yuan to 2 yuan throughout the day, and the asking price of each factory is even higher. The transaction of each goods on this street is more than 2,000 pieces, and the best customer sales are the Guangdong and Yunnan gangs. The office handles more than 600 pieces of bleached cloth, colored cloth, colored twill, fine cloth, and coarse cloth. The Anhui gang needs more than 100 pieces of striped bleached cloth, colored cloth, and other goods. The demand of the Zhejiang and Fujian gangs is weaker. On the 16th, 145 pieces of cloth are shipped.</p>
<p>The opening of Dongbu in the morning was flat, and then the north gang resigned, and the market price rose in a straight line. At noon, Long brand fine cloth was sold at 42 yuan and 50 cents, and Juzi Biji was called at 1 yuan 33 and a half points. In the post-market, the peers on this street suddenly went on a diet, and the rising trend became more intense. The fine cloth continued to rise by 2 yuan per piece, and the Biji jumped by 10 cents per yard. The closing price was 45 yuan and 50 cents for the leading brand and 1 yuan 48 and a half points for Biji, which also set an unprecedented high price.</p>
<h3>Securities: Foreign Stocks Jump Horizontally, and Wheelock &amp; Co. Multiplies its Value Tenfold</h3>
<p>Yesterday's black market in securities, the market situation, rose and fell again, the European war spread extremely rapidly, and the rest were rising, coupled with the rumors in this port were stirring, people were panicked, selling and taking profits can be seen at any time, the transaction was not much, and the trend was extremely soft. The opening price was directly downward from the high price, and the closing price throughout the day was the lowest price. Yesterday morning, the opening was pushed up by the bulls, and the opening price was 90 cents, which was maintained for five minutes. After that, the selling became more intense, and gradually softened. Runli, Yitai, and Nos. 20 and 38 were sold one after another. Hongda, Renchang, Yichang, and Jiufeng were initially quite absorbed, but later they gradually felt satisfied, and then they were about 20 cents. In the afternoon, Defu and Jiafu also came to unload, and the selling of Nos. 11 and 14 by the North Gang was even more intense, and the buyers became rarer. Jiufeng and Runli slightly compensated, and the total return was about 30 cents to 40 cents. The total number of transactions was about 6-700,000 yuan. The following is a simplified table:</p>
<p>Stock trading, 50 shares of Deda Shipping Company were traded, with a price of 55 yuan per share.</p>
<p>In addition, the stock market of the Public Works Bureau was thriving due to the start of cyclical trading. The trading was very lively at the morning auction due to the crowded orders decided overnight. Almost all kinds of industrial stocks had buyers' interest, of which British United, Steel, and Jardine were the most active. The demand for the shares of each holding company was also good, but the transaction was not very strong. The buyers' intention to increase their positions was not diminished throughout the day, and the price rose slowly until the end, when the bulls' power was stronger and the evening closing price was the best of the day.</p>
<p>Rubber stocks were ignored. Although the exchange market was firm, investors seemed to be intentionally coming out of the rubber stocks and exchanged them for industrial stocks for the time being, so the majority of prices decreased.</p>
<p>According to the International Trust stocks, the face value of 10 taels, has now risen to 27 yuan and 75 cents. The face value of Shanghai Silver Company stocks is 5 taels, and yesterday it was 29 yuan and 50 cents. The face value of Wheelock &amp; Co. stocks is 10 taels, the highest last year was 76 yuan and the lowest was 28 yuan, and yesterday it has risen to 160 yuan, which is more than ten times the rise. The Jardine stocks are 5 taels, and yesterday it has reached 55 and a half.</p>
<h3>Grain Prices: Rice Market Turns Flat</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market started weak but tightened later, eventually closing flat. The early market saw original wholesalers holding firm, while retailers showed little interest. A stalemate prevailed, and sales were unusually slow. Eventually, holders of surplus stock lost heart and began to sell off, dropping prices by more than half a yuan. Mainstream retailers then started to buy in small quantities. Sorted Xiaojiao was sold for 40 yuan, Saigon No. 1 for 44.3 yuan, and No. 2 for 41.2 yuan. Inland clients also started to scoop up cheap goods, and sales quickly increased. The market rapidly turned upward, seemingly poised to break the previous week's high prices. However, wholesalers suddenly released large quantities of their holdings, causing supply to meet demand and halting the upward momentum. Prices remained stable, with no changes by closing. Closing prices matched those of the previous week. As for japonica and glutinous rice, the Da Chang Company from Hongkou imported over 5,000 bags into the Settlement. Due to soaring prices in the Japanese market, japonica transactions saw prices exceeding the upper limits, leading sellers to hold onto their stock. There were no samples available on the market, and private deals were unprofitable. Standard High Japonica was priced at 45 yuan, Medium at 43-44 yuan, Changzhou and Kun Japonica at 43-44 yuan, Suzhou-Tong Japonica at 44 yuan and 43.5 yuan, Powder Japonica at 42-43 yuan, Qingzhou Special Thin at 45 yuan, Chong Special at 44 yuan, General Market at 43.5 yuan and around 43 yuan, and Nangang early and late rice at 42 yuan, down to 41.5 yuan. The glutinous rice market mirrored other varieties, holding steady without significant fluctuations.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 11,000 bags of rice were transported to Tianjin on the Taikoo Company's Nanchang vessel, along with 1,500 bags of corn, which were customs-rejected on the Shuntian vessel and reloaded onto the Nanchang for Tianjin. These foreign rice shipments were finalized by the Da孚 Foreign Firm.</p>
<p>Foreign rice remained stable in the morning. Although Nanyang brokers purchased nearly 10,000 bags of Sorted Xiaojiao, Saigon, and Siamese rice, prices only increased by 3-4 jiao. By the afternoon, rumors spread widely, including that neutral countries were joining the war and that long-term orders were hopeless. These rumors were promoted by large speculative firms. With new firms becoming active and retailers competing to buy, the market suddenly tightened. Spot and futures prices rose uniformly. Saigon No. 1 for future delivery, which opened at 52.5 yuan in the morning, jumped to 54 yuan in the afternoon, a significant increase of 1.5 yuan. No. 2 for April/May delivery, which opened at a low of 51.5 yuan in the morning, gradually rose to 52.3 yuan, then opened at 52.5-53.3 yuan in the afternoon, climbing steadily and rising by 1.8 yuan from morning to afternoon. Spot Saigon No. 1 opened at 45 yuan in the morning, increased by half a yuan, and then reached 46 yuan in the afternoon. Other rice varieties rose in tandem, with afternoon high prices nearly a yuan higher than morning prices. Overall trading was active, totaling 17,000-18,000 bags of spot rice and 700 tons of futures.</p>
<h3>Flour Firm, Wheat Holds Steady</h3>
<p>The flour market is showing strength. The No. 1 Flour Mill's list price remains at 13.5 yuan. Amid international stability and high commodity prices, mills consider their list price to maintain the local market's nature, so they are temporarily not increasing it. However, retail sales in local shops are slow. While there has been a slight increase in wholesale purchases recently, wholesale prices remain high at 15 yuan, deterring retailers. Limited purchases are still made occasionally. No. 4 flour is priced at 12 yuan, prompting some buying by wholesalers. The old brand numbers for returned goods are depleted. Yesterday, 2-3,000 bags were traded in the local market and inland, with 7-8,000 bags distributed by mills. The market is gradually becoming more active due to the high price of gold and rising rice prices, as well as disruptions to railway transportation.</p>
<p>The wheat market remains at a standstill. After prices fell to 21.5 yuan, holders were reluctant to sell. Furthermore, domestic wheat supplies are dwindling, and foreign wheat orders are becoming increasingly expensive. With mills experiencing slow demand and seeking to maintain lower inventories, a stalemate has developed between buyers and sellers.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Sales Active, Prices Rise Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean market started calmly. Exports to Hong Kong and Xiamen, along with domestic demand from oil mills and local speculators, boosted sentiment and slightly increased prices. In the afternoon, rumors of Italy joining the European war spread, leading speculators to believe there was an opportunity. The market was encouraged, and prices rose. High-quality soybeans rose by another half a yuan, with medium and lower grades also increasing slightly. A total of three truckloads of Bengbu soybeans were traded at 20.5 yuan, over eight hundred bags of Anqing soybeans at 22.5-22 yuan, six hundred bags of Wuhu soybeans at 21 yuan and 20.02 yuan, five hundred bags of Qingdao soybeans at 27.5 yuan, and three hundred bags of Dingjiazhou soybeans at 22.8 yuan. Today (16th), 2,180 bags of soybeans will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Japanese Silk Continues to Decline, Zhejiang Silk Has Some Transactions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was no trading in New York. Yokohama spot silk was priced at 1510 yuan, near-term at 1508 yuan, down 40 yuan each, and long-term at 1514 yuan, down 42 yuan. There was no activity in the foreign firm silk market. Zhejiang's Special Superior Grade New York City brand was priced at 2700 yuan, and the secondary brand Racecourse Grade at 2300 yuan, the same as the previous market. There were no transactions for White Silk Factories, and Indian firms were also quiet. Only about 25 dan of Zhejiang silk was traded.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Refined White Sugar Increases by Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>According to a telegram from Hong Kong, Taikoo refined white sugar B mark has risen to HK$16.05, up HK$0.45. Consequently, the local Sugar Guild also adjusted its prices accordingly. Spot Second Grade Coarse White from foreign warehouses just arrived was initially priced at 63.78 yuan, then 63.9-63.95 yuan, and finally 64.3 yuan. Transit goods remained at 51 yuan. Taikoo refined white sugar increased by half a yuan. B mark Western Warehouse initially priced at 65.5-65.8 yuan, later 67 yuan. Other prices include Refined Red Sugar H mark decreasing by 7 jiao, initially at 49 yuan, later at 50 yuan. Dutch red sugar at 52.78-53 yuan, up 2 jiao. Local snow white sugar at 63 yuan, Local No. 1 crystal sugar at 76.5 yuan, Crystal clear ice sugar at 78 yuan. National sugar: Drawn Green strip sold 46 pieces at 39 yuan, Shimen sliced green over 100 bags at 43.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dried Fruits and Nuts: Longan from Quanzhou, Local Speculators Buy Up All Stock</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a letter from Quanzhou stated that local Quanzhou speculators had bought up all longan stock, increasing purchase prices by 18 yuan. The price of new longans has also increased. However, Shanghai is not actually selling them, and no imports have been opened for sale. Market conditions are on the decline. More and more uncertain.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops from Jiangwan Head West, Fierce Fighting Erupts on Qinghu Road, Over a Thousand Japanese Troops Advance from Zhao Xiang, Chinese Troops Under Gu Fusheng Fight Back</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning (April 15th) at dawn, residents in the Hongqiao Road area on the edge of the Settlement suddenly heard the sounds of artillery fire, intermittent but continuous. According to travelers from the Qinghu Highway and Hongqiao Road, a large-scale engagement occurred between guerrillas southwest of Zhaoxiang Town on the Qinghu Highway, about 30 kilometers from Shanghai, and Japanese troops. The ferocity of the fighting was unprecedented in past guerrilla warfare around Shanghai. Most of the Japanese troops in the Jiangwan district of Shanghai had been dispatched to the Qinghu Highway to fight.</p>
<p>Four Japanese Tanks Deployed</p>
<p>Reportedly, seventeen Japanese military trucks, fully loaded with about six to seven hundred Japanese soldiers, along with four tanks, had previously passed through the Da Xi Road, Zhongshan Road, Hongqiao Road, and then turned onto the Qinghu Highway to be stationed in Zhaoxiang Town. At the same time, Japanese troops were also increased in various strongholds west of Shanghai, such as Huangdu, Nanxiang, Panlong, Zhudi, Xujing, and Caohejing, from dozens to one or two hundred. At dawn at five o'clock yesterday morning, a large force of Japanese troops launched a major offensive southwest from Zhaoxiang, attacking the troops of Gu Fusheng, the third detachment of the Songhu Guerrilla Force. This was where the main force of Gu's troops was located, so they bravely engaged in battle.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting Continues into the Evening</p>
<p>The number of Japanese troops mobilized was over 1,500, while the Chinese side also had a considerable number. Therefore, it is believed that both sides suffered extremely heavy losses. As for the outcome of the battle, the travelers reported that they left Qibao, near the boundary of Qingpu, at 2:00 PM, and the fighting had been raging for seven hours and had not yet stopped. When they reached Hongqiao Town, they could still hear the intense sound of machine-gun fire. They also learned that Gu's troops had attacked Japanese and puppet troops under Xu Xingzhou and Yu Taosheng at Dujia Xing, west of Qibao, on the afternoon of the 12th of this month. It seems that this Japanese action was in retaliation. It is also reported that the Japanese troops deployed yesterday were from the Tanaka unit, while the Chinese troops were from Gu Fusheng's unit.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops in Anting Rush to Build Fortifications</p>
<p>According to someone from Kunshan, Anting Station, along the Jinghu Railway, is located at the intersection of Kunshan and Qingpu, and Huangdu Station is located at the intersection of Qingpu, Pei County, and Jiading, all near Shanghai and less than 20 kilometers from Shanghai. There were already guerrilla forces in these areas, stationed with puppet troops, and they had agreed not to fight each other. The puppet troops were responsible for providing intelligence. The Japanese army was aware of this but sought peace and dared not interfere. However, recently, over a thousand New Fourth Army soldiers arrived in the area and have absorbed the guerrillas and puppet troops. Fearing this, the Japanese troops have retreated to the train station and are rushing to build fortifications, working very busily.</p>
<h3>European War Has No Impact on Rice Prices, Rumors Refuted, Rice Market Stabilizes Again</h3>
<p>After the rice market to Japan slightly increased due to speculators' rumors that the European war was impacting foreign rice shipments to Shanghai, the market has stabilized as the rumors have been disproven and domestic rice supplies have gradually become more accessible. The Rice Trade Market Tea Party issued Public Announcement No. 131 yesterday stating, "This market's spring entry permits, expiring on the 14th of this month, are all invalidated. For the summer new permits, rice merchants should still exchange them through the Rice Merchants Guild, brokers should collect them through the Friendship Association, and all members of our industry and sales companies must bring their old permits and three months' worth of tea fees within the scheduled period from the 15th to the 17th of this month, from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, to the North Office to exchange for new permits. The "Compilation of Broker Companies" has been published and is priced at 5 jiao per copy, which can be collected with payment. This announcement is hereby made for general information."</p>
<h3>Chinese Taxpayers' Association Writes to Hotel Industry Regarding Increased Tax Negotiations</h3>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Settlement previously responded to the request of the Hotel Industry Guild to forward a letter to the Public Works Department to negotiate a reduction in the business license tax for hotels. The Association has already forwarded the letter to the Public Works Department, but has not yet received a response from the Department. The Taxpayers' Association has now responded to the Hotel Industry Guild, detailing the progress of the negotiations.</p>
<h3>Difficult to Dissolve Refugee Camps, Those Willing to Return Home Given Travel Expenses, Elderly and Weak to Be Assisted</h3>
<p>Although there has been talk of disbanding charity organizations in the city, according to the person in charge of the Refugee Relief Association, only the Dunxin Road First Refugee Camp is directly under the Association. Other organizations, such as the Ciliantonghui and Cilianfenhui, still have 32 refugee camps. These camps mainly provide free rice and coal, supplied by the Refugee Relief Association. Although supplies are currently difficult and dispersal is actively underway, there is no guarantee that they will be forcibly dissolved on the 30th. As it is currently the spring plowing season, some young and strong refugees are willing to return to their hometowns to make a living and will be given some travel expenses by the camp. However, for the elderly and weak, methods of resettlement must still be sought.</p>
<h3>New Auxiliary Coins of the Ministry of Finance Flow into the Shanghai Market; Aluminum Coins' First Batch Issued, Second Batch Arrives in Shanghai; Application System Still Adopted for Receiving Fractional Currency Notes</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance adjusted the fineness and weight of various auxiliary coins, the Central Mint in Chengdu, Kunming, Guilin, Lanzhou, and other factories have been casting new auxiliary coins of one, two, five, and ten fen denominations. These new auxiliary coins have been reviewed and approved by the Review Committee and handed over to the Central Bank for issuance and circulation in the market. Although Shanghai does not import them for issuance, those that flow into Shanghai through other channels are also valid for normal use. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that the new auxiliary coins are cast from a copper-zinc alloy, but the five and ten fen coins contain 18% nickel, hence their yellow color. Due to the highest copper content, the design features the "29th Year of the Republic of China, Blue Sky White Sun emblem" on the front and an ancient coin model with the denominations "One Fen," "Two Fen," "Five Fen," and "Ten Fen" on the reverse.</p>
<p>Aluminum Auxiliary Coins: First Batch Fully Issued</p>
<p>The aluminum one and five fen new auxiliary coins were issued exclusively in Shanghai after the Shanghai Banking Association requested and received approval from the Ministry of Finance. The first batch of ten million coins has already been fully issued, and the second batch of ten million coins, half one fen and half five fen, will be issued immediately after arriving in Shanghai, replacing the first batch. For the time being, only banks and native banks are allowed to receive them. All member banks and native banks of the Banking Association and member banks of the Foreign Banks Association can receive them from the Silver and Native Banks Clearing House and the British-owned HSBC. As for various companies, firms, and factories, they can exchange them in appropriate amounts from their usual banks and native banks.</p>
<p>Fractional Currency Notes Issued: 3 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank previously received approval from the Ministry of Finance to issue one and five fen fractional currency notes, with a total stipulated amount of seven million yuan, contracted to the American-owned Yongning Printing Company. The bank has been issuing them as needed based on market demand, to alleviate fears of a shortage of auxiliary coins. A total of approximately three million yuan has already been issued, with five fen notes accounting for the majority. The five fen notes are currently in high demand on the market. The issuance will not be suspended due to the issuance of aluminum auxiliary coins. However, for the sake of prudence, an application system will still be adopted. All businesses can apply to the bank if they have legitimate needs.</p>
<h3>Foreign Taxpayers to Hold Annual Meeting Tomorrow; Japanese Intend to Launch Political Offensive; Chinese Pay Attention to Proposed Tax Increase</h3>
<p>The scale of gathering is comparable to the Board of Directors election of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The annual meeting of foreign taxpayers is scheduled for 2:30 PM tomorrow at the Race Course Grandstand. Judging from the current situation, the Japanese are likely to use the proposed 50% increase in municipal taxes at this annual meeting to launch an offensive against the Shanghai Municipal Council, potentially leading to a major Anglo-American political struggle against Japan. The British and Americans are extremely concerned that they have slightly fewer eligible voting taxpayers than the Japanese because the only votes that British and Americans can manipulate are those from the European expatriate group. With regard to the proposed tax increase, the Chinese community is sending messages hoping to avoid a serious problem by backing down before reaching the edge of a cliff. Details are described separately as follows:</p>
<p>Mo Su to Serve as Chairman of the Meeting</p>
<p>The annual meeting of foreign taxpayers of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession is scheduled to be held at the Race Course Grandstand at 2:00 PM tomorrow. The esteemed magistrate Mo Su will serve as the chairman. The Chairman of the Council, Mr. Fessenden, will report on the general situation of the Shanghai Municipal Council's administration over the past year. Among the proposals for discussion, the most important is the approval of the new budget of 16,000,000 yuan for 1940 to 1941, in addition to reviewing the annual financial statement for the previous year and revising the rules of procedure for the annual meeting. The Shanghai Municipal Council plans to increase the overall municipal tax, special property tax, and land tax surcharge by 50% starting from July of this year, which will be discussed in conjunction with the budget proposal and is receiving unanimous attention from all parties.</p>
<p>Chinese Community Focuses on Tax Increase Issue</p>
<p>Since the announcement of the proposed tax increase, there has been strong opposition from both Chinese and foreign taxpayers. The Chinese Taxpayers' Association has also lodged a written protest based on the wishes of taxpayers, requesting a halt before reaching the edge of the cliff. Now that the proposal is about to be discussed, a reporter inquired with a key member of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association yesterday. According to the member, the wishes of the absolute majority of Chinese should be respected by the authorities, and foreign taxpayers should also avoid creating problems for themselves. The consequences of the tax increase have been repeatedly stated; it not only increases the burden on taxpayers but also has a significant impact on the entire market and social order.</p>
<p>Hope Taxpayers Will Attend Unanimously</p>
<p>Currently, the election committees of the British, American, and Japanese communities are striving to secure the support of their respective backers to ensure their attendance at the annual meeting and to take concerted action. Significant progress has been made in recent days. The American Community Committee has held an emergency meeting specifically for this purpose, and in addition to the Shanghai Municipal Council's budget for the coming year, it has also printed a rebuttal to be distributed to taxpayers for their reference when attending the annual meeting of foreign taxpayers. The Japanese taxpayers have also gathered several times at the Japanese Chamber of Commerce on Peng Road to discuss how to deal with this year's annual meeting. The British Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. George, has already sent letters with his personal signature to all taxpayers, urging them to pay attention to the upcoming annual meeting of foreign taxpayers and to ensure that every taxpayer attends to maintain the rights and interests of the entire British community.</p>
<p>Japanese Residents Claim They Will Have Proposals</p>
<p>According to Japanese newspapers, the Japanese are now trying their best to divide the opinions at this year's annual meeting of foreign taxpayers into two distinct camps. Although the Shanghai Municipal Council has announced that any proposals to be submitted to this year's annual meeting of foreign taxpayers must be written and submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Council six days before the meeting, the semi-official Japanese newspaper, the Continental News, has ignored this point and claimed that the Japanese side will submit urgent temporary motions at this year's annual meeting. It is also learned that the Japanese taxpayers may hold a meeting tonight convened by Mr. Rin Yuji. According to sources with difficulty obtaining information, this meeting will decide whether the Japanese side will continue to adopt a political offensive to seek its superior position in the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Municipal Council Sends Personnel to Urge Participation</p>
<p>The Municipal Council also sent Chang to speak with expatriates from various countries yesterday, providing instructions on this year's annual meeting of foreign taxpayers, in order to increase taxpayers' interest and attend to vote. His words were roughly as follows: "Taxpayers must pay attention to the following: (1) You must attend this year's annual meeting. (2) The annual meeting of foreign taxpayers is scheduled for 2:30 PM tomorrow at the Race Course. (3) Unless the taxpayer is away from Shanghai or unable to attend due to illness, proxy voting is not allowed. (4) The Municipal Council's regulations on vehicles are as follows: After a taxpayer's car enters the entrance, it must drive around the race track once before being directed by the police to the parking area. (5) Official vehicles enter from Ma Huo Road and park at the jockeying area."</p>
<h3>Coal Industry Association Asks Authorities to Protect Coal Transport Vessels</h3>
<p>The coal dealers of Maotai, Huaxiang, Zhengda, etc. in this city sent a letter to the Coal Industry Association yesterday, stating that the vessels of this company used to transport coal are often stolen and damaged by hooligans when entering and exiting the Suzhou Creek at night. These people disregard the law, swarming onto the ships, threatening and intimidating, and forcibly carrying away goods. This company is unable to resist due to the disparity in numbers. Furthermore, when the ships arrive at the McGon Road Yidaijiao Wharf to unload, a large number of vagrants gather to openly pick up and secretly steal, making it impossible to reason with them and unable to prevent them. Based on the above situation, this company has specially sent a letter to the association, requesting that the association submit a document to the police authorities of the Public Concession, requesting protection. According to Su merchants, the Coal Industry Association has forwarded it to the police department, requesting protection.</p>
<h3>French Commander Gasquevel to Leave Shanghai for France Tomorrow; Inspects National Defense Forces at the Race Course Yesterday; One of the Grandest Occasions in Shanghai Lately</h3>
<p>At 10:00 AM yesterday, the British, American, Japanese, French, and Italian defense forces stationed in Shanghai were all lined up at the Jing'an Temple Road Race Course to be inspected by Colonel Gasquevel, the commander-in-chief of the French garrison stationed in Shanghai, who is about to leave Shanghai. The White Russian troops of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps also lined up to participate yesterday. It is understood that this inspection was one of the grandest occasions in Shanghai lately. Colonel Gasquevel drove his own car to the Race Course, escorted by six fully armed police officers. Upon arriving at the scene, he was greeted by senior officials from various countries' garrisons, expressing their welcome. Colonel Gasquevel then walked around the perimeter and shook hands with more than fifty senior military officers from various countries' garrisons to express his thanks. Colonel Gasquevel is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Paris tomorrow on the Jean Laborda. His successor will be Mr. Esdati.</p>
<h3>Marshall Writes About the Amazing Progress of Chinese Industry; The Southwestern Hinterland Fortress Has Become an Industrial Center; Brilliant Achievements That Are Already Self-Sufficient</h3>
<p>The spring issue of the "China Quarterly" contains an article by Mr. Marshall, chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, praising the development of Chinese industry. He believes that China's industrial advancement can not only achieve self-sufficiency but also enable the country to become wealthy and compete with other countries. His article reads in part:</p>
<p>Rapid Progress in Inland Industry</p>
<p>"As a result of the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, most of China's modern new industrial areas were destroyed or fell into the hands of the Japanese. This was undoubtedly a great loss to China. However, as a result, Chinese industry was able to flourish in the rear, fully exert its strength, and enjoy the freedom and guarantee of development. It has been able to actively build and mass produce, far surpassing Chinese industry in 1937, which is truly amazing. According to reports from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Industrial Section and the Central Government, we can see that Chinese industry has made rapid progress and reached a successful stage. On the contrary, in all the occupied areas, various factories have either shut down or are unable to recover. Even if some factories have resumed operations, they are difficult to compensate for their losses in 1937. This is not only due to the severity of the destruction, but the main reason is that most of them are operated by the Japanese.</p>
<p>Factories Scattered Like Stars</p>
<p>According to the report, industry in the non-occupied areas has not only seen extensive development, but the widespread distribution of factories has spread across various regions like stars. In addition, the 활발 of cooperative enterprises has enabled the newborn factories to embark on a bright future. But on the other hand, there are other factors, such as the increasing accessibility of transportation, the prosperity of foreign trade, and the large-scale development of raw materials. Due to the above-mentioned factors, southwestern and western China have opened up a brand new world and become the industrial center of the country.</p>
<p>Seeking Alternative Paths to Resolve Difficulties</p>
<p>However, the industry in western China still faces difficulties. This difficulty is not caused by competition with other parts, but its only difficulty lies in the obstruction of waterway transportation, and highway transportation has not yet been fully developed. The solution to the difficulty is only one, that is, to find a way to build the Yunnan-Burma Railway, but this plan has not yet been fully successful, and in fact, the completion of the railway is not something that can be achieved in two or three years. Therefore, the way to solve it is to find another way. Industrialists all over the country have concentrated their attention on how to break up large factories that have already been established into small factories, because the establishment of small factories and mechanical equipment are easier than large factories. However, judging from today's achievements, the output of China's newborn factories is actually enough to make China self-sufficient and not have to rely on foreign countries. Looking at the state of Chinese industry for the past two and a half years, it seems that there has been a great change. Those that were once regarded as important industrial areas are no longer noticed. On the contrary, those areas that were once barren have now become the most military important industrial areas."</p>
<h3>Anti-Tuberculosis Campaign Closed Yesterday</h3>
<p>The anti-tuberculosis campaign initiated by local famous doctors Ding Fubao and Ding Huikang, which opened on the 15th of last month at the Hongqiao Sanatorium on Avenue Joffre, has been going on for a month and ended yesterday as scheduled. According to statistics from the Hongqiao Sanatorium, in this short month, a total of more than 2,100 people went for physical examinations, and more than 500 people needed to have X-rays taken. This shows the large number of common people in this city who suffer from tuberculosis. However, according to Chinese customs, most people who suffer from this type of disease are reluctant to talk about it. Moreover, in this time of rising prices, it is difficult to maintain a living, so how can there be extra money to take care of this? Since the Ding family initiated this campaign, the inspection fees have been low, so the general public has begun to pay attention to it. It is hoped that this campaign will be expanded from private to public, so that there will be no fear of economic exhaustion, and then it can become a permanent organization, because this kind of campaign is especially necessary to continue to promote.</p>
<h3>International Relief Committee Completes Mission; To Complete Closure Within the Month; Name Will Still Be Retained</h3>
<p>The Shanghai International Relief Committee was organized by various leaders, charities, and Chinese and foreign individuals in Shanghai during the war. At that time, artillery fire was raging in the suburbs of Shanghai, and refugees had no way to escape. As an international organization, the committee entered and exited Hongkou, providing the most effective rescue efforts. Later, when the National Army withdrew westward, many refugees from the Nanshi area were also rescued by the committee, and the establishment of refugee zones was particularly meritorious. A total of six large-scale shelters were established to house displaced refugees, totaling no less than 200,000 people. The committee established a craft group, first creating refugee production, to save public funds. Last year, it also assisted the French Concession authorities in housing street beggars and providing them with education. Now that the refugees in Shanghai are being collectively housed by the Refugee Relief Association, and the number of people being housed is much smaller than before, it is believed that the mission has come to an end. Preparations are currently being made to complete the closure by the end of this month. However, the name of the International Relief Committee may still be retained.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Orders All Customs Houses to Issue Wartime Allowances; Jianghai Customs House Has Already Paid</h3>
<p>In order to take care of the livelihoods of customs officers in various places, the Ministry of Finance has issued "Wartime Allowances." Whether customs officers, tax police, or servants, all are paid at 40%. Those who receive a new salary of 100 yuan per month will receive an allowance of 40 yuan. The allowance will be cancelled as soon as the war stops, which shows the authorities' concern for their subordinates. According to a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency, the Jianghai Customs House originally planned to pay the allowance at the same time as the official salary on the 25th of this month. However, it is learned that the customs house has advanced the payment of the first batch, that is, those in the internal service, and paid them separately on the 12th and 13th of this month. The second batch is scheduled to be paid within today and tomorrow. The allowance is from March of this year, so the April allowance has not yet been paid. It is heard that it will be paid at one time on the 25th of this month. The smallest amount of the allowance is more than 10 yuan, and the largest is about 180 yuan. As for the previously approved rice subsidy, it will continue to be paid until the rice price drops below 15 yuan, then it will be cancelled. It is also learned that customs houses in other places have also been paying them separately.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Patriot Ji Aji; Deeply Patriotic; Regrets Being Too Old to Enlist; Consecrates the Rest of His Salary to the Motherland</h3>
<p>According to the Overseas Chinese Fundraising Association, Chiang Kai-shek's wife recently received 53 yuan from Ji Aji, a 67-year-old overseas Chinese hunter in Dutch Borneo, along with a letter stating that he has lived overseas for 30 years and has always been patriotic. If he were still young and strong, he would be willing to return to the country to join the war and be honored to sacrifice himself on the battlefield. Now that he is old and lacks funds, in order to fulfill his national duty, he will donate the rest of his salary to the motherland for the purpose of resisting aggression and reconstruction. According to records, when Ji Aji first arrived in Borneo, he was not in business. Several years ago, the economic recession affected Dutch East India, and Ji Aji's business failed, leading to bankruptcy. Since then, he has made a living by hunting. Last year, in August, he remitted 40 yuan and 4 small yuan and a corner separately to Chongqing.</p>
<h3>American Radio Station Still Subject to Radio Wave Interference; Equipment Can Be Used to Detect the Location of the Interference; But Shanghai Does Not Yet Have This Type of New Machine</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that the wavelength of the American radio station XMHA in this city was still subject to external radio wave interference yesterday (14th), causing the Christian church sermons, music programs, and Mr. Alcott's news reports broadcast on the radio station yesterday morning until night to be affected. A Christian church reporter, during a broadcast last night at the radio station, denounced this as "malicious interference" and stated that listeners who could not clearly hear the sermons broadcast could obtain a printed full text. The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury also reported that according to the radio engineer, it is now possible to roughly determine the source of the interfering radio waves with equipment. However, to determine its exact location, special equipment is required, and Shanghai does not yet have this type of latest special equipment available. Therefore, the source of the interference to XMHA is not easy to find for the time being.</p>
<h3>Did the Japanese Election Failure Really Cause a Crisis? Commentary from the New York Min Sheng Forum; Small Troubles Are Also Worth Paying Attention To</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, 15th dispatch from Sisi, the results of the Shanghai Public Concession election of directors were recently commented on by the New York Min Sheng Forum, stating that the Japanese side originally hoped to control the Shanghai Municipal Council but did not achieve its wishes. From now on, it may cause a new crisis. The election of directors of the Shanghai Public Concession, although like a very small surface of water in a very small teapot, actually contains the possibility of causing a Pacific war... A Japanese spokesperson once said that they must win a majority of votes next year, so it is better to wait quietly at this time. But can the Japanese military wait quietly until next year? Judging by their intentions, their second step is likely to be through the hands of the "Nanjing regime" to demand the return of the concessions to the treaty countries. If so, it will inevitably be rejected by the governments of Britain and the United States. Then what will Japan do? Although this kind of trouble is very small, this teapot is the epitome of the Pacific. Therefore, this kind of small trouble is also worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>Suma Expressed Great Alarm</p>
<p>United Press International, Tokyo, 15th report, Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Suma Yakichiro stated today that the results of the Shanghai Municipal Council elections greatly surprised him, saying that there were many shocking things before the election, such as the sudden increase in the number of votes in a certain aspect of the Public Concession, which was one of them.</p>

Lawyer Ru Baoyi of the police station stated that the suspect Gu Zhuxuan in this case was confessed by the previously arrested defendants. Because urgent investigation is needed, he requested permission to detain him temporarily and to be tried jointly with Wei Shulin.</p>
<p>Joint Trial Investigated</p>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan confessed, "Last night I had dinner with friends at the Hongyun Club. I suddenly received an emergency phone call from home, saying that there was an urgent matter and instructing me to return immediately. After I hung up the phone, I took my car home. Who knew that the police were already waiting at my house? I was arrested as soon as I got out of the car, saying that I was suspected of instigating murder. I beg the judge to investigate thoroughly. I am really wronged." Judge Feng verified the confession and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and rescheduled to be tried jointly with Wei Shulin and others on the 17th of this month.</p>

The employees had no choice but to hand over the key and open the safe. The robbers then reached in and took a gold ring, a gold pocket watch, and a large amount of banknotes, totaling 19,400 yuan. After packing them up, the two robbers without weapons left first. After a while, the two robbers with guns left the shop calmly and disappeared.

<h3>Min Wenju's Lustful Courage Was Boundless, and He Tried to Rape a Friend's Wife</h3>
<p>Chen Gao, a local female worker at the Shenxin Fifth Cotton Mill, 28 years old, lived with her husband and sister Chen Miaoxian at No. 174 Yanshan Road, Hongkou. At around 11:00 PM on the 12th of this month, while she was sleeping soundly, Min Wenju (24 years old, from Jiangbei, who had been working at the "China Workers' Welfare Association" at No. 127 Longjiang Road), broke into her bedroom on the pretext of visiting a friend. Seeing that she was lying on her back and not awake, he actually had boundless lustful courage and went forward to take off her small clothes, intending to rape her. She was awakened and grabbed Min, shouting loudly, causing a violent struggle. At that time, she lost a gold ring and a wristwatch that she was wearing. Min's chest was also scratched. As a result, Min still escaped. After she reported the incident to the Yulin Road Police Station, the police station sent detective Qiu Sijiu to the "Welfare Association" on the morning of the 13th to arrest and detain Min. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Court.

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I was shocked to read the news item in yesterday's edition of your newspaper stating, "Tai Linsheng, in the name of the Kangjiaqiao Citizens' Association, brought thugs to extort fees from Xie Yuming, a rickshaw puller at No. 61, and assaulted him." I have resided in Kangjiaqiao for decades, and I have always conducted myself properly in all my dealings with people. Recently, due to the damaged roads and clogged gutters in Kangjiaqiao, which become muddy bogs every time it rains heavily, I used my name to send a letter to the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council to dredge the Kangjiaqiao sewers. The Public Works Department has already sent personnel to discuss the matter. The funding for road construction and public welfare projects has been voluntarily assumed by familiar factories and shops. I have never extorted fees from people in the name of the association. Furthermore, I have investigated and found that Tan Honghai resides at No. 61 Kangjiaqiao, and there is no division of the residence. 61 Route Cardinal Mercier is exclusively occupied by the Shen residence. This news is clearly a fabrication and a deliberate defamation of my reputation. After the incident, I investigated with the police station and found no evidence of assault, nor is there any record of such an incident at the hospital. I hereby request a correction. Yours sincerely, Qin Linsheng, April 15.</p>

<h3>Husband of "Madam Leng Xiang" and Dance Girl Convicted of Adultery, Each Sentenced to Three Months' Imprisonment, Suspended Sentence Granted</h3>
<p>The local woman, Yin Junong, is twenty-six years old, daughter of the late famous Shanghai doctor Yin Shoutian. She was betrothed to Chen Zonghui (courtesy name Yuanliang), the second son of Chen Weiquan, a wealthy antique dealer from Nanjing residing at No. 12, Moliai Road, by matchmakers Xia Yingtang and Zhao Huihe, and married in the auditorium of the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road in January of the 24th year of the Republic. They have since had two daughters. However, Yin enjoys Kunqu opera, often performing on stage, with the stage name "Madam Leng Xiang," and enjoys considerable fame in the Kunqu opera community. But Chen Zonghui, because his wife did not cater to his liking, caused the love between husband and wife to break down. Recently, Chen has been wandering outside, neglecting his business, and often frequenting dance halls. Yin's persuasion was ineffective, and she returned to her mother's home. Chen became even more unscrupulous, recently becoming acquainted with Zhou Lianfang (also known as Xu Shirley), a nineteen-year-old dance girl from Taizhou at the Xianle Dance Hall, and renting a room on the floor of No. 593, Route Lafayette, to cohabit with Zhou, disregarding his wife Yin. Now that Yin has learned of this, she reported it to the French police on the morning of the 28th of last month. Detective Qian Shibao was dispatched to apprehend the adulterers, arresting Chen and Zhou, and seizing soiled clothes and socks, bringing them all to the police station. After investigation, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special Second District Court that afternoon. The police lawyer prosecuted them for adultery and violating family harmony. The defendants hired lawyers Le Junwei, etc., to defend them. After questioning, the court ordered the defendants to post bail, instructing both parties to settle the matter out of court and reschedule the hearing. All of this has been recorded in this newspaper. Now, because the settlement failed, Judge Li Jinshan presided over a continued hearing at the Eighth Criminal Court yesterday morning, questioning the two defendants. Their testimonies contradicted each other, all in an attempt to evade responsibility. The court also summoned the handling detective to recount the circumstances of the arrest of the defendants. With the facts of the case now clear, the court ordered closing arguments. Police lawyer Yuan Jiahuang argued that the evidence of the defendants' crime was conclusive and requested that they be sentenced according to the law. The defense lawyers of the two defendants then made their arguments. The court then announced the conclusion of the trial, and the court ruled that Chen Zonghui, having a spouse, committed adultery with Zhou Lianfang, and Zhou Lianfang committed adultery with a married person. Each was sentenced to three months' imprisonment. If commuted to a fine, it would be calculated at three yuan per day. Each was granted a two-year suspended sentence, and they remained on their original bail during the appeal period.</p>
<h3>Pu Ziling Quit Smoking Medicine Illegally Published Distributorship Advertisements, Prosecuted for Forgery, Scheduled for Sentencing</h3>
<p>Pu Ziling Quit Smoking Medicine Bureau, located at No. 3 Yongxiang Lane, corner of Edward Road and Belle Road, was leased to Hua Fa Company in February of this year to continue operations. The company then conducted extensive publicity, illegally publishing the name of Dalai Company, located at the intersection of Three Horse Road and Southern Henan Road, on its prescription sheets, claiming them as an exclusive distributor. Recently, Dalai Company discovered this and reported it to the French police, claiming that Hua Fa Company had forged its name and affected its reputation. The police, upon receiving the report, dispatched detectives to bring Wu Shiqi, a shareholder and manager of the company, to the police station, and confiscated a bundle of prescription sheets. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Second District Court, prosecuted under Article 25 of the Criminal Law for fabricating false information in business matters. Judge Liao Yan presided over the trial. The defendant hired lawyers Wang Heng and Gu Zhulv to defend him, and his testimony was evasive. The court, considering the facts of the case clear, ordered closing arguments and scheduled the sentencing for the 18th. The defendant was ordered to post a 300-yuan bail, and if unable to do so, he would be detained.</p>
<h3>Shooting Incident Occurred at the Huile Palace Gambling Den in Western Shanghai, Caused by an Interpreter Picking a Fight</h3>
<p>A shooting incident occurred at the Huile Palace gambling den in Western Shanghai around 2:00 AM yesterday morning. A Taiwanese man named Zhong, who is a Japanese interpreter, was introduced to work at the Huile Palace by the "gambling den supervisor." Recently, Zhong neglected his duties and was reprimanded by "the department," and his dismissal was scheduled for the 15th. Upon learning this, Zhong became extremely angry and wanted to use a gun to snipe the head of the department. However, because Zhong did not have a firearm, he turned to Ma Yushan, the leader of the den, to borrow one, but was unsuccessful. A dispute ensued, followed by a physical altercation. Suddenly, a gunshot was heard, and Zhong immediately fled into the accounting room. Although the shot did not hit anyone, Ma was severely injured by Zhong and was sent to the hospital for treatment, where his life is in critical condition.</p>
<h3>Pioneering Effort in the Chinese Medical Community: Institute Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>The National Medical Research Institute of this city, located at No. 2 Haiwei Road (corner of Ma Huo Road), is organized by famous figures in the National Medical community (see edition of this newspaper from the 12th year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty).</p>
<h3>Old Newspaper, New Copy: Sixty-Seven Years Ago (356) (See this newspaper from the 12th year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty) Distinguishing Between Wheat Consumption and Illness</h3>
<p>In the South, rice is the staple food, and wheat is a minor food; in the North, wheat is the staple food, and millet is a minor food. Below millet are coarse grains, while rice and wheat are the most refined. In ancient times, sacrifices used millet, sorghum, beans, and foxtail millet to suit the suitability of the five soils; and from ancient times to the present, both high and low commonly eat rice and wheat, and the most widely planted crops are rice and wheat. In the region of Yangzhou, the grain is rice, but wheat is also planted occasionally. The fields of the North are not necessarily unsuitable for rice, but because the nine rivers have lost their channels and defenses, the summer is dry and scorching, and there is concern about autumn floods breaching the dikes, all of which hinder the ripening of rice. If wheat is planted, it is harvested in early summer, without worry of this. Therefore, the North now uses wheat as the staple food, and interplants sorghum and millet to supplement the deficiency. Even if sorghum and millet do not grow well, it is not a major problem. In fact, the land beneath the sky is suitable for the growth of all grains, and the people beneath the sky are also suitable for the consumption of all grains. Rice and wheat both have sweet and neutral flavors. Rice harmonizes the middle, while wheat nourishes the middle. The natures of the two are not very different. Today, doctors who do not understand ancient books and do not ask about distant customs often forbid people from eating wheat, and I do not know what they see in this. Do they say that its merit is to benefit qi? Qi is what the body receives. If the body is weak, qi must be insufficient. Wheat can benefit qi, and it is beneficial for diseases of qi deficiency. Why is it not edible? They then say: "Since wheat nourishes the middle, it benefits qi. The power to benefit qi lies in stimulating what the human body's organs receive. Over time, this causes illness; or if there is an existing illness, it is time for it to break out, and the effect of wheat is no different from leading it to the point of eruption. People who are already ill have weak qi. Nourishing what is weak is a wonderful remedy, but there is concern that it cannot nourish and instead aggravates the illness. So it is better not to eat it." They also say: "The earth qi in the North is strong, and people's bodies are solid. Wheat can benefit their qi; the bodies of Southerners are weak, and wheat is suitable for triggering their illnesses."</p>

<p>Education</p>
<h3>Family Education is More Important than School Education</h3>
<p>— Zhou Wu</p>
<p>Ordinary people generally believe that the reason for youth crime is poverty, driven by hunger and cold; however, the truth is not entirely so.</p>
<p>Recently, an American film company made a short film that also proves this point. The film narrates a case in which the police authorities in a certain area of the United States cracked a theft case, and the three main culprits arrested were all underage boys, and their families were all well-to-do, living comfortable lives. So, why did they engage in this theft?</p>
<p>The answer the film gives us is: parents did not take good care of their children. They dress their sons warmly, feed them fully, and think they have fulfilled their responsibility. They do not pay attention to what their children do for recreation in their spare time after school. Ideally, parents should accompany their children to spend their spare time, doing some beneficial exercise, games, or conversation. But, unfortunately, most parents treat their children like cats and dogs that are raised, considering it enough to feed and clothe them, thus producing these various bad consequences.</p>
<p>From this, we can know that parents' responsibility to their children is not only in "providing" but also in "education." Poor parents may not be able to make their children live comfortable lives, but they can give their children good family education, which is far more beneficial to their children than wealth.</p>
<p>Although newspapers and magazines often carry news of young people committing crimes because they are forced by poverty, there is no lack of incidents of wealthy children not engaging in proper occupations and going astray. Therefore, poverty is by no means the only reason for youth crime.</p>
<p>Youth is the period when one is most easily infected with bad habits and drifts into evil ways, because young people are mostly inexperienced in the world and have relatively weak judgment. Therefore, when children gradually grow up and are about to come of age, parents should pay attention to their children's actions and provide patient guidance so that the future masters of the country all walk on the bright and righteous path.</p>
<p>In China, especially in today's Shanghai, school education only focuses on imparting knowledge, and the responsibility for teaching how to conduct oneself in the world is left for parents to shoulder themselves.</p>
<p>So I say: Family education is more important than school education.</p>
<p>Cultivation</p>
<h3>Daily Vacation</h3>
<p>— Cao Lingyou</p>
<p>Living in this bustling city, life is very stressful. Rushing around, covering oneself in dust, operating and competing, the brain is already tired enough. Furthermore, the surrounding environment is full of various novel stimuli. Everyone at home bears various unnecessary worries and troubles. Under these circumstances, our mental health is taking a big hit!</p>
<p>According to surveys, people in the city are prone to neurasthenia, because our environment is really too bad, but everyone cannot leave the city to go to the countryside to live a life of working at sunrise and resting at sunset due to their occupation. Therefore, we must think of some ways to regulate our tired brains so that they do not fall into a state of mental imbalance.</p>
<p>Because our lives are too stressful, we must develop a calm attitude and prescribe a kind of daily vacation.</p>
<p>The daily vacation does not need a lot of time, ten minutes is fine, twenty minutes is fine. This daily vacation is simply more important than spring break, winter break, and other regular holidays. We must know that hard work will not harm people, only insufficient rest will harm people. The daily vacation is to get a moment of rest in an extremely stressful life.</p>
<p>People who can take advantage of the daily vacation can not only eliminate various mental illnesses, but also increase work efficiency.</p>
<p>The late U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt was a person who was good at taking advantage of daily vacations. He found more than ten minutes of time in his extremely busy life to read his favorite collection of poems every day. A young man used the time before and after each meal to play musical instruments, resulting in an additional skill. There was also a young man who used the extra time after lunch to capture various scenes on the street, resulting in becoming a photography expert.</p>
<p>Really, if you are a very busy person, then you need more daily vacations to regulate your tired brain and make it refresh itself!</p>

<h3>The Importance of Autobiography</h3>
<p>— Hu Hongji</p>
<p>A few days ago, I was fortunate enough to meet an elder of society. During the ninety-minute meeting, he expressed his lifelong thoughts and views on life. Among them were many surprising and delightful stories, and many materials that could serve as lessons for future generations.</p>
<p>I advised the old gentleman to write down his autobiography. But he humbly said, "I am not a remarkable person, I don't like to self-promote."</p>
<p>I disagree with this. While there are people in the world who use autobiography for self-promotion, not all people who write autobiographies are like this, nor do they necessarily have to be like this. Because everyone only lives once, life is really an adventure, an attempt, an experiment. In the decades of our lives, we have bitterness, sorrow, laughter, tears, sincere regrets, and painful experiences and lessons. There are many mistakes that we are unwilling to make again, and there are many tragedies that we do not want to repeat. In the struggles and struggles of our lives, we have gained many valuable lessons. These lessons are given to us by society, so we should return them to society. We should not hide them like Chinese "ancient secret recipes," causing society to suffer an invisible loss. We should pass on these lessons as a reasonable legacy to our descendants, so that future generations can accept our lessons without cost, avoid the mistakes we have made, and live a better life.</p>
<p>I not only hope that this old gentleman will write down his autobiography, but also hope that everyone who earnestly lives a faithful life will have an autobiography to leave to their descendants.</p>

<h3>Carnegie's Struggle History</h3>
<p>— Wen He</p>
<p>Dale Carnegie, the author of "How to Win Friends and Influence People," has already become a world celebrity. His eloquence has made him an excellent speaker. However, his situation in his childhood was not smooth, and his current position is entirely due to his own struggle.</p>
<p>He came from a farming family and studied at a normal school in a small city when he was young. He was determined to become an outstanding person. He knew that he was born very thin and small, and there was no hope of standing out in the sports field. However, under the guidance of his mother, he had a lot of experience in reciting by heart, and he used this strength of his to join the school's debate team. In the first year, he participated in several debate competitions, but he did not fail in any one of them.</p>
<p>He was extremely frustrated. At that time, he went to listen to a lecture by a lecturer at a summer training session. The lecturer looked very wealthy, had a very generous attitude, and had very skilled posture. He talked about the story of a poor rural child, which was very moving and quickly captured the interest of the audience. He said that this child once felt that his future was very bleak, but he never thought that he would one day succeed and become a person admired and admired by everyone. The lecturer talked about the climax of the story, and he said to the audience: "You want to ask, who is this discouraged child? Ladies and gentlemen, the person you are looking at now is him!"</p>
<p>Carnegie was also sitting in the audience listening, and he was enchanted by the lecturer. This lecture was the first time in his life that he heard such an interesting speech; and the story itself was very likely his own story. He still has a deep impression when he thinks about it now, and he said: "I saw this lecturer running around everywhere by train, staying in hotels, and wearing such a dignified white stiff collar; and I knew that he was once a poor country boy like me, and I was confident that I could succeed one day too."</p>
<p>After that lecture, he used a new method to participate in school debates. He also worked hard to recite famous speeches. Every day, he rode a horse to and from the farm to school, and he often gave Lincoln's "Gettysburg Address" and other famous speeches to this horse. He was so fascinated by speech that all the teachers and students in the school immediately recognized him as the best speaker in the school.</p>
<p>After graduating from normal school, he did two businesses and also wanted to become an actor, but he still eventually took the old road of lecturing. When he was twenty-four years old, he contacted the New York YMCA and wanted to borrow their place to run a speech training class. The YMCA agreed to his request, but he said that he wanted to take two dollars for each session, and the YMCA thought that this number was too big. They agreed to a split account method, and they were willing to give Carnegie 80% of the total income. They thought that this number must be very small, but Carnegie was immediately very popular after he started lecturing, and many people were trained. And other YMCAs came to ask him to open a speech training class. Two years later, his weekly income was already 500 US dollars.</p>
<p>The YMCA's speech class laid the foundation for Carnegie's career. The success of "Carnegie Conversation and Communication College" and his "How to Win Friends and Influence People" had already planted the seeds in his youth.</p>
<h3>Words from the Earth's Core</h3>
<p>— Lu Anzhi</p>
<p>The average density of the Earth is 5.5, while the average density of the Earth's surface is only 2.5. Therefore, many precious heavy metals, such as red gold, tungsten, and radium, are stored in the Earth's core. If one day humans are able to excavate the metals in the Earth's core as easily as they mine now, the value of gold nuggets will be as low as ordinary stones, and the world's financial market will inevitably undergo a drastic change.</p>
<h3>Accumulate Small Amounts to Make a Large Amount</h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>Once, the American oil tycoon Rockefeller borrowed a dime from his secretary to pay for car fare. "Please remember, don't forget this dime." He said.</p>
<p>"Mr. Rockefeller, oh, what does this count as!" The secretary replied. "What does it count as!" Rockefeller suddenly shouted, "A dime is the interest of a dollar for two full years!"</p>

<h3>Wang Yaoqing Recounts Anecdotes About Tan Xinpei</h3>
<p>— Yan Wu</p>
<p>The reason why five famous actors are able to become famous must be that they have agile thinking and actions. When I was in the old capital, the old court supplier Wang Yaoqing once said to me: When Tan Da Wang first became famous, there were many people in the industry who were jealous of him, especially a certain bearded actor. One day, the Seventh Prince of a certain Wang Mansion was celebrating the birthday of his wife. Famous actors from the old capital were all summoned to the mansion to perform and offer toasts. Tan Da Wang and the certain bearded actor were also among them. The certain bearded actor thought that the opportunity to make Tan make a fool of himself had arrived, so he begged a certain opera coordinator to arrange for him and Tan Da Wang to be on the same program; and to be able to perform in the same scene. The certain did not know the intention of the certain bearded actor, so he assigned Tan and the certain bearded actor to perform "Borrowing Arrows with Straw Boats," with Tan Da Wang playing Kongming and the certain bearded actor playing Lu Zijing. When performing the scene where Kongming and Zijing were drinking wine in the boat, the certain bearded actor suddenly asked Tan: "May I ask, sir, there is a white cloud in the sky, I wonder what good or bad fortune it portends?" This was fabricated by the certain bearded actor. There was no such line in the play. He meant to ask this question suddenly, Tan must not be able to answer suddenly, and the audience would definitely boo him. If so, the certain bearded actor's usual jealousy could also be vented a little. Unexpectedly, Tan Da Wang calmly waved his feather fan and replied: "Heaven's secrets cannot be revealed, please come closer." Then he whispered in his ear: "Your ancestors." The certain bearded actor nodded and gestured, saying: "So that's how it is."</p>

<p>"Mei Luo Xiang" was the first play staged by the China Traveling Troupe after it was allowed to operate. According to Tang Huaiqiu, it was also a play that allowed him to perform excellently. This time, the China Traveling Troupe revived it after "Thunderstorm" and "Sunrise," not only because it was likely to be a crowd-pleaser, but also for two other reasons worth knowing.</p>
<p>First: It has already been decided to rename "Mei Luo Xiang" to "New Mei Luo Xiang." In this era, there are countless women with weak wills like Mei Luo. However, when they reach the end of the road to depravity, they can still turn back to the shore, break free from everything, and resolutely seek a bright future dedicated to the country, which is rare. Mei Luo Xiang originally commits suicide, but after encouragement from an old actor, she recreates her life. This can be said to be not Mei Luo Xiang, but Mei Wu Xiang. At the same time, in this play, the playwright emphasizes Ma Ziying's progressive ideas, which is also valuable.</p>
<p>Second: The Mei Luo Xiang we have seen before was performed by Tang Ruoqing, Bai Yang, etc. However, "New Mei Luo Xiang" uses a newcomer, Li Qinglai (who performed in "The True Story of Ah Q"), to play the role of Mei Luo Xiang, and another newcomer, Lan Qing, to play Xiao Chunlan. These are both new attempts by the China Traveling Troupe.</p>
<p>"New Mei Luo Xiang" is still in four acts. Tang Huaiqiu's Bai Senqing, with his cunning and opportunistic demeanor, is indeed the most outstanding character in the entire play. He is particularly able to use subtle actions to highlight the character's personality. The scene where he forces Luo Xiang to write a letter breaking off relations with Ziying is extremely vivid. Standing in the opposite position to Senqing is the progressive youth Ma Ziying. The role of Ziying is played by Shi Wen from "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty." He is resolute and passionate, with a successful performance. Xiao Chunlan is well-integrated. In this moving tragedy, the embellishment of a vain woman like Chunlan, who thinks she is clever, is indispensable. Lan Qing's diligent performance also won the audience's praise. As for the role of Mei Luo Xiang, it is very demanding. She has to express the personality of a woman with a weak will, while her heart is filled with passion and trauma, intertwined with contradictions and confusion. Li Qinglai is able to perform this quite refined and movingly, which is indeed commendable.</p>
<p>The most relaxed scene in the whole play is the first half of the third act. When Xiao Chunlan comes to see Mei Wu Xiang, the dialogue could be shortened to make the emotions more compact. When Bai Senqing appears, the climax gradually rises. The first act alone has a climax (the debate between Ziying and Senqing), which is also rare.</p>
<p>The realism of the characters in the play, the humorous and powerful dialogue, and the magnificent scenery of the third act, if the emotional impact of each act can be further emphasized, it will certainly be one of the successful plays of the China Traveling Troupe.</p>
<p>often took care of her. Whenever Huicong encountered any difficulties, she would often ask him. Thus, their friendship gradually progressed to the stage of love.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Huicong's mother passed away, leaving her an orphan. Although she still had her uncle, Zhang Xiaotian, and other relatives, they were ultimately no match for her own parents. Therefore, finding a home was a matter she urgently needed to resolve. At this time, she felt Wen Kui's intimate comfort, which made her even more devoted. She resolutely decided to cohabit with Wen Kui.</p>
<p>The reporter went backstage to interview both parties about this matter. Huicong seemed to retain the shy nature of a girl, only smiling and refusing to express anything. Wen Kui, however, frankly said: In the past, because the time was not ripe, we kept it a secret from relatives and friends. Now, to avoid all kinds of rumors, and since it's not a secret affair, it's better to make it public formally. I asked him if he would hold a cohabitation ceremony, and he replied straightforwardly: Of course!</p>
<p>Speaking of this, he went on stage to perform. After finishing, Huicong was waiting for him in the dressing room. After removing his makeup, they left the backstage together. Their manner was, of course, very intimate. Although Huicong had suffered two major misfortunes in one year, she felt much comforted by this happy marriage.</p>

<h3>Liu Wenkui and Zhang Huicong's Love Matures</h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>—Cohabitation Ceremony to be Held</p>
<p>Liu Wenkui, a martial arts laosheng and Zhang Huicong, a kundandan, from the Yifeng Troupe at the Carlton Theatre, have recently announced their cohabitation after their love has matured. Their union is well-matched and couldn't be more suitable. The reporter also knows a little about the process of their love. They had a good relationship backstage and often discussed plays together, finding each other very compatible. Since Huicong unfortunately lost her father last year, leaving the mother and daughter to depend on each other, Wen Kui often</p>
<h3>Hua Yun in "Battle of Taiping" is a Mistake for Hua Yun</h3>
<p>The play "Battle of Taiping" has been relegated to an opening play for sweep-the-stage laosheng for many years. This time, when Guan Dayuan joined Gengxin, I advised him to perform more plays featuring bearded laosheng because he was slightly short in stature, had an aged complexion, and his voice was more suitable for high pitches than low. I also told him to sing fewer plays involving wearing green clothing and performing acrobatic movements. I had also previously detailed the characteristics of "Battle of Taiping" in the newspaper. Therefore, when he first performed the play, although it only filled about 80% of the seats, the second time he performed it, he even sold more than a hundred seats on the stage. Later, many ticket agents kept asking him to perform this play, wanting to see how he flipped the "rattle drum" when Hua Yun was captured, and how he sang the old tune of the line "Standing here is your lord, General Hua Yun." This is because this kind of flipping and singing is something that general Tan school bearded performers can't do nowadays. Dayuan had been down on his luck for many years, but this time he was very popular, performing for three months with few signs of decline. I think his "Battle of Taiping" can be considered his signature play. Originally, every famous actor should have three or two signature masterpieces, and the advantages of these plays should be well known to the public, so there is no need to worry about not being welcomed. For example, Cheng Yanqiu's "Hongfu Biography" and "June Snow" are always full houses whenever they are performed, which is because these two plays made him famous in the opera world one after another and are known as Cheng school famous plays. The worst thing is when an actor can do everything, but everything is mediocre. I'm afraid it will be difficult to become popular even if they sing a lifetime of plays.</p>
