<h3 id="c18">美國蘇聯密約說 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>國際當然有種種新醞釀與新準備，庶幾可以應付方興未艾，無法捉摸的種種劇變。例如日前倫敦電傳：英美蘇三國將締結同盟，以對抗德國支配歐洲，及日本支配亞洲約計畫。又如昨日華盛頓電傳：美國在野黨議員海密爾敦費許氏，在衆議院提案請求質問總統羅斯福氏，美蘇之間，是否有一密約或秘密諒解，即一日蘇聯牽入與日本或德國作戰，美國按照所約，得在海軍方面或其他軍事方面予蘇聯以援助。這兩項消息，我們未以爲根據了既然的事實而發；且以爲英美蘇三國同盟雖非無其可能，美蘇密約雖有其必要的論據，然在目前，是否已經成熟，是否正在醞釀，是否開始了發動，盡是疑問。我們所不疑者：並世諸强國的政治家，鑒於當前國際劇變中所包含的危機，必深切感覺到萬難獨善其身，計惟有選擇幾種國際力量，設法糾合，謀所以共同應付今後種種緩急劇變的來臨。在這一個前提之下，我們縱使尙未確悉諸强，何者已在醞釀，何者方事準備，然必有所醞釀準備，則事屬可想而知。</p>
<p>在英國的主力經過一次大規模作戰而告段落之前，甚難想像英國在國際乃得收穫何種重大的成就。不但如此，即如最近，英屬香港與緬甸所遭壓迫，英國政府猶能婉辭堅拒，雖日事理在所應爾，然亦不能不想像英國在此艱危之中，即此消極的堅拒，亦屬難能可貴而値得稱道。蓋英國今日在歐洲，除蘇聯容當別論之外，甚難遽望獲得强有力的與國；在亞洲，香港緬甸所受壓迫，不以堅拒或忍受而消弭，這纔是壓迫的開始。假使英國在歐洲沒有繼續作戰的決心，在亞洲沒有堅拒壓迫的勇氣，則不僅在歐洲，即在亞洲方面亦必被視爲業已戰敗的國家而非忍受再接再厲的壓迫不可。有決心，有勇氣，然後可以求致與國；而與有同情者，在事實上亦祇能暫作好意的觀望；若求强調這種決心與勇氣的客觀效騐，則繫於今後一仗的主力戰。遠東的壓迫不足予英國决一主力戰以何種不利的影響，而主力戰的結果，却將影響及於英國在遠東的地位。戰的結果不可知，然對英國好意的以及惡意的觀望者，必期待者，準備着。</p>
<p>美國與蘇聯，地理的處境不同，歷史的恩怨不同，立國的精神信仰以及基層組織舉不相同；然國際劇變到了這一階段之後，他們所感覺的利害與危機，則應大體完全一致了。蓋無論爲美國打算，或爲蘇聯打算，都應該希望歐洲與亞洲各自維持其相當的均勢；然美蘇兩國各不相謀之結果，惟有坐視歐亞兩洲之內，均勢遭受動搖，坐視强有力者向着獨覇而昂進。當然，在歐洲或由英國與德義對抗而維持均勢，或則假定英國被封鎖於大陸之外，還可作萬一均勢之望；即德義各得外衛自此分庭抗禮，力敵勢均；但只是萬一之望，亦只是短時期而不穩定的均勢罷了。在亞洲，惟有中國抗戰勝利，纔成均勢之局。不獲均勢，則由稱雄者領導了他所控制的整個資源，形成超越國家的更大作戰單位。近有日人放言高論、略謂天下四分，日本亞洲，德國歐洲，美國美洲，蘇聯跨歐亞兩洲；我人誠不知對此高論，墨索里尼氏如何感想？誠不知日本的亞洲夢中將有何種夢魔？然美蘇兩國各不相謀，坐視日本膨漲之結果，美蘇兩國中必有一國爲第二輪的被挑釁者。第一輪原爲中國或蘇聯，事實上却是中國首當其衝：萬一中國抗戰失敗，英法諸國當然不得不退出遠東而拱手讓人，則彼囊括中國，羽毛豐美後，必確定美蘇爲假想敵，而擇其一國，乘瑕蹈隙。然則美蘇如何終得獨善其身？以此利害，以此危機爲衡，雖美國議員費休氏砟日所質問者，未必有何確鑿根據，但美蘇兩國政家甚應消弭任何質問以及困難，促成兩國强有力的平行行動。能若是，深信必有益於國際。</p>

<p>— 譯英海軍上將培根爵士原著</p>
<p>海上戰略，可說現在，過去，和未來都是一致的。其唯一的目標端在擭得海上控制權；使友邦和中立國的船隻，得在海上通行無阻，敵國的船隻，無論戰艦商船受到封鎖。</p>
<p>海上戰略雖則一成不變，但是「海上控制權」的複雜化則與年俱進。拿破侖時代的海戰，凡能作戰而擊破敵方艦隊，或封鎖其戰艦於港內，使之不能爲害；然後用護衛艦來保護自己商船的航運，那末已做到海上控制的地步了。上决歐洲大戰時，這步工作因受潛水艇，水雷及魚雷的影響，已大見複雜；不得不採用水中保護的方法。目下因爲空軍活躍的緣故，這種任務又見難上加難。空軍不僅爲船隻攻守的耳目，且能攻擊船舶。在某種限度中，他們又能在海岸間的上空，藉運輸速絡，來摧毀海軍的海上控制。</p>
<p>因之，今日之所謂澈底海上控制者，須包括海上，水中和上空三方面的控制而言。可是目下複雜化的程度，又變本加厲，在若干海上，簡直要控制無方了。原因由於國際法規定三英里領海中准許各種船隻，不問中立的或交戰國的，來往自由。</p>
<p>英國在地中海的戰略，當視同盟與敵國的情形爲轉移。現在所最成問題的，當然只有義大利了。在此種情形之下，惟有着眼於地中海的封鎖，使船隻出入，立吿停止。更進一步，最好把蘇彝士運河完全封鎖，達達尼爾海峽局部封鎖，直布羅陀的入口完全堵塞起來。至於地中海方面港與港間的交通，從大體上說，可以母庸考慮。</p>
<p>在過去的十五年中，差不多每年有五個月的時候，我居住在義大利，認識了他們不少的海軍軍官，尤其是高級將校。我敢說他們都很卓越，精明果敢，十分前進。近幾年來他們對於指揮軍艦作戰之術，更見進步。巨砲射擊，在海上聽聲測遠，進步之處已達四倍。義大利的海軍有他世襲的特徵，與德國大不相同。英國與義大利在海上作戰時，難保他們不一顯身手，逈異於德國的海軍。</p>
<p>義大利海軍部近年爲建造潛水艇及高速度馬達魚雷艇，常年所化的錢甚爲可觀。潛水艇的威脅，在過去幾個月中已大爲動搖，因爲我們的水兵對於潛水艇的偵察與毀滅，其熟練工夫已大見增進；但是這種東西仍極可怕，尤其運用於西西里與菲洲海岸間的狹水之中。所謂高速度馬達船聲昔太大，不能視作具有重大價値的武器；何况氣候稍見惡劣，這種船就不能運用了。</p>
<p>英國的商船現已變更通過地中海的航錢。海軍已省事多了。這時英國軍艦的唯一任務，只須在海上打擊義大利艦船，或阻止其行動就完事。義大利在地理上的位置，因爲他據有西西里，特黎波里，和利比亞的空軍根據地，最便於攻擊經過地中海狹隘地帶的英國商船。但是，如果沒有商船可肆攻擊，這位置就白廢了</p>
<p>義大利的弱點，就在據有三個殖民地。伊利特利亞和阿比西尼亞惟有紅海一條可通達。英國可在蘇彝士運河外三英里地帶，立刻把它們封鎖，以切斷其交通錢。然後把阿比西尼亞土著武裝起來，大部土人早已預備起來與義大利作戰。再從中東部的陸軍中，抽調軍隊去攻亞的斯亞比巴。第二個殖民地利比亞，係埃及至突尼斯的一條海岸，義大利如果要運輸軍隊或給養至特黎波里，英國的海空軍儘可加以攻擊。</p>
<p>馬爾太將成爲一個極有用的空軍根據地，在那里可以獲得敵人行動的情報，而使英國的巡邏隊得以警戒。這島當不免要　敵軍的更番轟炸。但是該島沿岸的大港和馬薩等處，早有無數的高射砲位設置着。如果設備合法，數量充足，這種高射砲和戰鬬機，可使敵方的轟炸機不能飛入海港上空。</p>
<p>義大利的第三個殖民地是杜得卡尼斯羣島，位於愛琴海的南部。這島嶼不但對於義大利毫無力量可言，反而使她暴露弱點；因爲與其他的孤立島嶼相仿，在戰事期中非得要有軍艦守護，而這些艦艇老早就已英雄無用武之地了。</p>
<p>義大利空軍甚强大，可爲其國防上之大助，但是英國也可以拿飛機來對付她的飛機，而英國的空軍戰鬬員，在這次戰事中已證明了他們的能力與勇氣。義大利的潛水艇倒是一個危險，不得不小心提防，但是這種武器的現在易於摧毀，較之上次大戰期中確乎兩樣了</p>
<p>攻襲義大利的海港也易於着手，對大蘭杜可予以轟炸。如果義大利的主要海軍被英擊破，那末亞得里亞海各港口便容受敵了。但是這里應該注意的，軍艦與要塞却不能相提並論。軍艦可被擊沉，砲台則不能，建造軍艦需時自十八個月至兩年半之久，要塞的建築自水泥堆砌起來，便可吿成；一艘軍艦的造價自一百五十萬鎊至六百萬鎊不等，一個堅强的砲壘僅費十餘萬鎊而已。</p>
<p>如果英國的海軍能在地中海上遇到義大利海軍而加以擊敗，那末義大利只餘北部的一條鐵路供運煤斤和其他必需品，到那時，她一定能了然於英國的封鎖，和她與她屬地所獲得餓饉，可使地中海的戰事早吿結束了。</p>

<p>各城市中兒童健康的外表是西班牙一個好的象微。記者曾在午餐時考察一個兒童集中營。那是一個從上午九時到下午四時，替家庭與母親任管理職務的機關。它是把幼稚園小學病院及寄宿舍鎔爲一爐，有着出身高貴的漂亮女郞做着雜務。在那所機關房舍的一端，有二百五十個女孩圍着輝耀的餐布正在餐桌上進餐。在另一端則爲同一歟目男孩的餐室。在他們的盤中，有着豐富的鷄蛋，魚、及碎悉薯，當女指導員開開門來領我進去的時候，每一個未吃完的孩子都從椅子上筆直地站起來，伸出右手行敬禮。</p>
<p>這機關的創立是在戰爭的時候，目的是在减除兒童受苦。但後來兒音的母親感覺很方便。許多在家裏要管理兒童的母親繼續把他們送到這機關內。這機關的一切費用是由公家出，是爲貧苦階級而設的。那些兒童由汽車夫早晚接送的，則這機關沒有他們的分。</p>
<p>西班牙的工人，用着那種旣可悲憫，又極英勇的熱誠，只要一有機會，無不竭其全力。西班牙的獨裁者佛朗哥也時常承認這一點，西班牙國民的願意工作，是西班牙無價之寳。如果有了這樣一個寳藏，而加上堅忍，再排除了智識階級的革命，西班牙的經濟復興，只是時間問題。</p>

<p>省中敎職員提高待遇</p>
<p>（三）省立各中學敎職員生活費待遇標準，本係參酌公務員生活費標準而定、惟本年度敎育文化事業費概算、須仍照上年度已核定之數目統籌支配、而各校班級自然增加、如公費生等名額亦隨之而增、原有事業、旣不能停止任何部份、統籌支配實感無法、因學校開支、除設備及辦公費外、全部卽爲敎職員薪金也、職是之故、欲求其能達與公務員相似之待遇標準、根本不可能、省立紹中、沈校長曾有函吿予、校中有四五位敎師、全家每日改食兩頓稀飯而不能得一飽、各校校長、因實際困難孔多、會請轉呈省府設法救濟、省府同人、察知實情、已決議自八月份起至年底止、另行撥助八萬元、由敎廳酌爲支配各校、作爲薪修津貼、各校之薪給標準，亦祇可自下學期起施行、又職業學校敎員薪給、已奉敎部令知另由敎部撥助、至　附小敎職員待遇、前已定有辦法、英文敎授講師等待遇、下學期起、亦酌爲提高、</p>
<p>公私中學校積極整頓</p>

<p>耶穌是特別傳福音給貧窮的人，所以世界上相信耶穌，貧窮人居多數，然所貧窮人信了耶穌以後，變成富足的到處都有。當耶穌在世的時候，祂自己是一生窮苦，祂曾說：「狐貍有洞，飛鳥有巢，人子（耶穌自稱）無安枕之處，一祂敎訓人說：「人的生命不在乎家道豐富，」又說：「不要為生命憂慮……你們只要求祂的國和他的義，祂些東西就必加給你們了。」祂又警告富足的人說：「你們要變賣所有的　濟人，為自己預備永不壞的錢囊，用不盡的財寶在天上；就是賊不能近，虫不能蛀的地方；因為你的財寶在那裏，你們的心也在那裏。」</p>
<p>富足的人大都自私自利，貪婪吝嗇，所以祂對那個富足的少年人說，當變賣你一切所有的賜濟窮人，再來跟從我，方能得着永生。富足的人果然不應該貪得無饜，自私自利然而貧窮的人，也不該依賴成性，遊手好閒，皆當勞力操作，自食其力，因為「天父也不斷地工作。」可惜世人不肯接受耶穌，更不認識耶穌是貧窮人的救主。倘使全世界的人，照耶穌的原則着實去做，就是富的人勿再自私，免棄貪心，有耶穌的博愛犧牲，自願將自有的財產扶危濟困；而生活艱難的人窮人，能自奮鬥，悉心工作，克勤克儉，因作工而吃飯，非因吃飯而工作；世上永遠沒有勞資的問題，貧富的階級了，耶穌的救貧，眞是根三的方法。耶穌實在是窮人的救主啊！世人當常輕看貧窮人，但耶穌郤尊敬他們；祂看貧窮人比富貴人更有價值；你們若信仰了耶穌祂必能拯救你們出來，保羅說：祂本來富足，郤為你們成了貧窮，叫你們因祂的貧窮，可以成為富足。」　　欲知詳細請函詢郵政信箱一五八一號</p>
<h3 id="c110">錢與面子 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— 張三郎</p>
<p>錢與面子這二件東西，照說是勢不兩立的，喜歡「面子」的人，就不得不把「錢」看輕一點；愛「錢」的人，也祇得不去十分講究「面子」。話雖如此，而事實上却有人抱定「錢是要的，面子我還是要的」主義，或許有人會說：「這樣好雖好，怕是辦不得到的吧？」或曰：「面子是個什麼東西，它值多少錢一斤？」</p>
<p>對！面子是個什麼東西呢？</p>
<p>一個校長先生說：</p>
<p>「……請了某聞人來做校董，原希望他捐幾個錢給學校的，可是他不捐；不捐也吧，他又送他的子女們到校裏來讀書；讀書也罷；然而他不肯付學費，這算什麼意思呢？和他去商量，他說：有面子人的子女們去讀書，照便是不付錢的，付幾個錢倒是小事，可是面子要緊，這付不得！……」</p>
<p>哦！面子原來就是這麼樣的一個東西！</p>
<p>最近，寗波一帶荒年，許多人熬不住飢餓，死掉了。已經死掉的拉倒，尙未死掉的得請大家商量個辦法，於是開會啦，選舉委員啦，打電報，募捐，調查貧民戶口，派員出洋採辦米糧啦……，認認眞眞地幹了起來，阿彌陀佛！幾個月後，總算把一大羣難民從陰間裏拖了出來，他們拿出四角錢，可以換回一升又黑又碎的米。黑米也好，碎米也好，四角錢一升，究竟是便宜的。</p>
<p>一天，有一個難民在街上談話，甲說：</p>
<p>「四角錢一升米，實在吃不起，聽說，再過幾天，連四角錢一升米都要買不到的了。」</p>
<p>「是呀！」乙說：「一聽到縣裏發賣平價米，誰不想去弄點便宜貨來？前幾天阿毛對我說：他主人家——那個在什麼機關裏辦事情的老爺，一共弄得十石米，每石祇化十九元，米色又好，粒頭也大。」</p>
<p>「阿毛的主人家可不是很有錢的嗎？他怎樣也有資格去買平價米？」</p>
<p>「面子呀！做人頂要緊的就是面子，他認識會裏的人，他說十石，那末就是十石。」</p>
<p>哦！面子原來就是這麼樣的一個東西！</p>
<h3 id="c111">一件小事 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— 曹靈佑</p>
<p>在擁擠的無軌電車中，突然的聽見了一位乘客和賣票員相罵的聲音。靜聽一下，相罵的原因，可說是極其簡單，並且是極小的事，可是因兩不相讓，結果，相罵的聲調隨着車輪的進行而增高。</p>
<p>那位乘客拿了一元的鈔票，向賣票員買兩張一角的車票。賣票員給了那位乘客兩張車票後，找回八角，就沒有事了。可是因為在賣票員找回八角之中，有着四角是五分的鈔票，那位乘客就囑令那位賣票員少給些五分的鈔票。賣票員一定不肯，並大聲的說：「這種五分的鈔票，又不是不好用的，是中央銀行的鈔票。又不是電車的代價券，假如是新的話，你也許要搶了。」結果，你罵我一句，我罵你一句，乘客口頭上的規勸，都告無用。假如相罵繼續不斷的進行，相打總免不了。在緊張的空氣中，忽有坐在我隔座的一位中年乘客，從自己的腰囊裏拿出兩張兩角的鈔票出來，向那賣票員對換那四角的五分鈔票，並囑令賣票員把那兩張兩角的鈔票給那位不肯要五分鈔票的乘客。賣票員氣冲冲的把八角的鈔票，給了那位乘客，於是一塲緊張的對罵，才停止下來。</p>
<p>這雖是一件小事，但我覺得有給讀者看的價值。</p>

<p>倪金壽道：「老毛，說下去。你說你看見的。看見什麼？」</p>
<p>老毛道：「看見那姓余的。」</p>
<p>「什麼時候看見他？」</p>
<p>「此刻——一兩分鐘以前。」</p>
<p>倪金濤作託異聲道：「一兩分鐘以前？」</p>
<p>「是的，我親眼看見。」</p>
<p>霍桑好像比倪金壽更瞭解老毛的語意。他接着問道：「你剛纔在門口看見他的嗎？」</p>
<p>老毛的視綫移到了霍桑臉上，點頭道：「是的，這位偵探先生叫我等在門房裏，不許出來。我悶得很，開了窗向外面隨便瞧瞧。我忽見余少爺從大同路那邊轉過來，先向停着的那輛載屍汽車瞧了一瞧，又向鐵門裏張望，却不走進來。他的模樣兒有些鬼鬼崇崇。正在這時，王小姐的屍體恰巧從大門裏抬出去。他的行動更叫人可疑。」</p>
<p>「怎麼樣？有什麼行動？」</p>
<p>「他走到抬床的旁邊，揭起那條白單被來，向王小姐的臉瞧了一瞧。他一瞧之後，不等那後面的警官走出門口，便飛也似地跑去了。」</p>
<p>霍桑思索似地靜止了一下，不卽回答。倪金壽便利著馬上接續下去。他向老毛說：「你擅自跑進來報告，祇是這回事嗎？」</p>
<p>老毛舐了舐嘴脣，答道：「先生，我看他的模樣兒很可疑。」</p>
<p>「可疑？這樣的可疑，你就說他是兇手？」</p>
<p>倪金壽的語氣中表示出十二分的失望。其實他剛纔的興奮，也未免太過度了。霍桑仍婉聲排解。</p>
<p>他說：「金壽兒，別心急哪。坐下來。老毛還有話說哩。」</p>
<p>老毛點點頭道：「先生，是的，昨夜他也來過，我也看見的。」　（四二）</p>
<h3 id="c114">上海的夏令兒童會 <a href="#c114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— 一份子</p>
<p>在這紛亂的時代，民眾在極端的艱苦中掙扎着，兒童所受的摧毀更難設想。就近看這孤島上的情形吧，街巷里弄，儘是些孩子們在奔跑亂嚷。一到夏天，更叫人看了心酸。他們一天到晚只爬在地上打玻璃彈子，仍香烟盒摺成的方塊，嘴裏隨意喊着汚穢的話，身上髒得像小豬，生活顯然在墮落中。做父母的見了也只有嘆息，因為生活所逼，住的是白鴿籠似的一間，吃的只够不餓死，平時已沒有担負敎育費的能力，何况現在是夏天，硬把孩子禁閉火爐一般的小屋子裏，怕不要蒸成肉饅頭？夏令兒童會的對象，便是這些貧苦失學的街童。</p>
<p>上海是寸金地，夏令兒童會也缺少舉辦的塲所。因為普通的學校都在上午設暑期班，所以舉辦夏令兒童會的可能時間，也只能由上午改至下午。這樣，因氣候的關係，服務員的設計工作又要加重不少。夏令兒童會的工作，普通有集會，談話，故事，識字，遊唱，常識，時事，衛生檢查和手工等項。每天的節目雖不繁重，但藉着與兒童友愛的團契生活，却能自然地貫澈敎學做的要旨。兒童經過五六星期的訓練，很能感受深刻而活潑的印象。</p>
<p>七月一那一天，全上海的夏令兒童會服務員，曾在靜安寺路清心女中舉行一個討論會。會塲上充滿了奮興感人的空氣。浸禮會婦女部總幹事凌鄔福音女士，演講街童敎育的重要和方法。</p>
<p>根據報告：去年在上海的夏令兒童會有二十六處，服務員共二百七十九人，所收兒童達三千五百二十九人。上海的工作是全國夏令兒童會的一部份。去年在全國計有夏令兒童會七百零四處，服務員二千五百五十八人，兒童二萬六千六百五十五人。本年上海的夏令兒童會，約有三十左右。已確定的有：老北門浸會堂，虞洽卿路慕爾堂，四馬路時報大樓滬東中學，大西路一〇八號眞光學校，極司非而路三十八號聖書學院，麥根路七五八號監理公會，靜安寺路聯吉里主恩堂，愛文義路六　六號廣東浸會堂，辣斐德路諸聖堂，法華懷本堂，靜安寺路五九一弄清心女中，山東路天安堂，四川路青年會中學，江西路墾業大樓華東聯中，大陸商塲滬江大學，南市普益社，大南門清心堂，愛文義路卡德路修德小學，武定路麥倫中學。其他各處，正在積極籌備中。</p>
<p>該會主張沉着地為街童盡實際上的貢獻。不要作擴大宣傳，但我聽見有的還找不到舉辦的地方，有的還沒有購買書籍的經費（每個孩子約需四角），有的也許還沒有發動，希望有較多的人協助這服務工作起見，作了這簡要的報告。好吧，你如能省吃一杯冰淇淋，已能捐助一個街童的書籍了。如能允借地位，或有其他物質上人力上的援助，都能助長這工作的進行。該會辦公處在圓明園路一六九號三樓基督敎協進會內。我誠懇地希望讀者能給他熱烈的響應。</p>

<p>德國在歐洲大勝之後，對於美國頗有虎視耽耽的模樣，美國一般孤立主義派因此又抬起頭來，主張不管外國閒事，影響所及，好萊塢現在拍攝中的若干反德的影片，都有被迫停製之虞。其全部損失，的達六百萬美金。</p>
<p>各片中首當其衝的，就是喧傳了兩年的笑匠卓別林個人出品「獨裁者」，其攝製代價爲一百五十萬美金，由卓別林獨自出資。其次爲米高梅公司的「逃亡」，代價一百二十五萬美金，「死潮」，代價九十萬美金。二十世紀福斯公司的「四令郞」「我與納粹主義者結婚」「惡覇覇」三片，全部價値二百三十萬美金。還有派拉蒙公司的「神秘海盜」，價値三十五萬美金，統在停拍之列。</p>
<p>按卓別林近日正駕駛游艇，在太平洋遨遊，聽得了這個消息，不禁有些着急，趕忙經　他的代理商聯合公司，發表闢謠的聲明，大意說道：「關於鄙人放棄獨裁者一片的傳聞，實屬無稽之談。該片現在剪接中，一經完竣，卽當公映。時至此際，全世界惟笑料是尙，蓋大笑一事，爲吾人健康上無價之寳也。」</p>

<p>— 稜白</p>
<p>卡爾登大戲院，如今巳在歇夏期中。不過，爲了救濟紹興難民，將於最近幾日內，舉行三塲義務戲，分兩天演出。</p>
<p>其中，除了小型報界票友全體出動，周信芳張翼鵬黃桂秋王熙春等等，都將協力合作。値得報吿者，計有「全部伐子都」「宋十回」「八大鎚」三份好戲。</p>
<p>「全部伐子都」中，由周信芳主演子都，張翼鵬主演穎考叔，前面除帶「舉旗拉車」，並帶黃桂秋的「孝感天」，可說近年劇壇罕有的盛會。「宋十回」中，除周信芳高百歲王熙春金素雯演出外，並帶王蘭芳劉斌崑的「活捉」，也是一時偉講。至於「八大鎚」，記得去年，信芳翼鵬，曾在共舞台合作演出，極博美譽，今决重演，轟動當然也在意料中。</p>
<p>據說，座價將要賣到五元，以這樣的陣容和堅强的劇目，况且又是爲了救濟難民，自然不好算貴。同時前台方面，也將義務開放冷氣，那確眞是觀者意外的幸福了。</p>

<p>London - Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Mamoru Shigemitsu, expressed Japan's dissatisfaction with Britain's attitude regarding the Yunnan-Burma Road during a meeting with British Undersecretary of State Butler. He reportedly requested that Britain promptly consider Japan's request to prohibit the transport of war materials through Burma to Chongqing. Shigemitsu also reiterated a warning that Britain's attitude was strengthening the measures of radical elements in Tokyo, who advocate for closer ties between Japan and the Rome-Berlin Axis. (1st day, United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo - British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, visited Japanese Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs Kani Yoshizo yesterday to inquire about Japan's attitude and plans after Britain refused to block the Yunnan-Burma Road. Regarding this matter, it is understood that the Japanese government believes that in order to end the Sino-Japanese war as soon as possible, it is necessary to cut off the supplies transported to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek via Hong Kong and the Burma Road. Therefore, it has been decided to adopt a tough stance towards Britain. If Britain continues to adopt delaying tactics, Japan will resort to final measures, with the Navy, Army, and Foreign Ministry acting in unison. (11th day, Haitong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>London - According to a diplomatic correspondent for The Times, the British side has issued new instructions to its ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, regarding his talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita Hachiro concerning Japan's claims that military materials are being transported from Hong Kong and the Burma Road to China. (11th day, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo - This morning, the Kokumin Shimbun commented that Britain's adoption of delaying tactics towards Japan's demands is rooted in personal interference by Winston Churchill's attitude towards Far Eastern politics. The newspaper stated that if Britain insists on implementing Churchill's proposals, the Far East will face a catastrophe because the British colonies in Burma and the Far East, unwilling to remain dormant, have been awakened by nationalistic ideas.

<h3 id="e18">The Alleged Secret Pact Between the United States and the Soviet Union <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Naturally, there are various new preparations and brewing in the international arena, so as to be able to cope with the ongoing and elusive dramatic changes. For example, a London cable reported a few days ago: The three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will conclude an alliance to confront the German control of Europe and Japan’s control of Asia. Also, yesterday's Washington cable reported: US opposition party congressman Hamilton Fish proposed in the House of Representatives to question President Roosevelt on whether there is a secret pact or secret understanding between the US and the Soviet Union, that is, if the Soviet Union is drawn into war with Japan or Germany, the United States, according to the agreement, will provide assistance to the Soviet Union in the naval or other military aspects. We do not believe that these two pieces of news were issued based on established facts. We believe that although the alliance of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is not impossible, and the US-Soviet secret pact has necessary arguments, at present, whether it has already matured, whether it is brewing, or whether it has begun to launch, are all questions. What we do not doubt is: politicians of the world's major powers, in view of the crisis contained in the current international dramatic changes, must deeply feel that it is extremely difficult to take care of themselves alone. The only solution is to select several international forces, find ways to unite them, and seek to jointly cope with the arrival of various urgent and dramatic changes in the future. Under this premise, even if we have not yet accurately known which major powers are brewing and which are preparing, it is conceivable that there must be brewing and preparation.</p>
<p>Before the main force of Britain goes through a large-scale battle to an end, it is difficult to imagine what kind of major achievements Britain can harvest in the international arena. Not only that, even recently, facing the oppression suffered by British Hong Kong and Burma, the British government can still politely but firmly refuse. Although it is reasonable, one cannot but imagine that in this difficult situation, even this passive refusal is commendable and worth praising. Because today, in Europe, apart from the Soviet Union, it is difficult to expect to obtain a strong ally. In Asia, the oppression suffered by Hong Kong and Burma will not be eliminated by refusal or endurance, this is just the beginning of the oppression. If Britain does not have the determination to continue fighting in Europe, and does not have the courage to firmly refuse oppression in Asia, then not only in Europe, but also in Asia, it will be regarded as a country that has already been defeated, and it must endure repeated oppression. Only with determination and courage can one seek allies. Those who sympathize can only temporarily wait and see with good intentions. To seek to emphasize the objective effectiveness of this determination and courage depends on the main battle in the future. The oppression in the Far East is not enough to have any adverse effects on Britain's decision to fight a main battle, but the result of the main battle will affect Britain's position in the Far East. The result of the war is unknown, but those who observe Britain with good intentions and malicious intentions must expect and prepare.</p>
<p>The United States and the Soviet Union have different geographical situations, different historical grievances, and different national spirits, beliefs, and grassroots organizations. However, after the international dramatic changes have reached this stage, the interests, dangers, and crises that they feel should be largely completely consistent. Because whether it is for the United States or for the Soviet Union, they should all hope that Europe and Asia will each maintain their proper balance of power. However, the result of the US and the Soviet Union not cooperating with each other is only to sit and watch the balance of power being shaken in Europe and Asia, and to sit and watch the strong and powerful moving towards monopoly. Of course, in Europe, either Britain and Germany and Italy confront each other to maintain the balance of power, or it is assumed that Britain is blockaded outside the mainland, and there is still a slight hope for the balance of power. That is, Germany and Italy each have external guards and stand on their own, with equal strength and equal power. But it is only a slight hope, and it is only a short-term and unstable balance of power. In Asia, only the victory of China's War of Resistance can form a balanced situation. Without obtaining a balance of power, the champion will lead the entire resources it controls, forming a larger combat unit that transcends national boundaries. Recently, some Japanese people have made high-sounding arguments, roughly saying that the world is divided into four parts: Japan in Asia, Germany in Europe, the United States in the Americas, and the Soviet Union spanning Europe and Asia. We really don’t know how Mr. Mussolini feels about this argument? We really don't know what kind of nightmares will be in Japan's Asian dream? However, the US and the Soviet Union do not cooperate with each other, and as a result of sitting and watching Japan's expansion, one of the US and the Soviet Union will be the second round of provocations. The first round was originally China or the Soviet Union, but in fact, China was the first to bear the brunt. In case China's War of Resistance fails, Britain, France, and other countries will of course have to withdraw from the Far East and give it to others. Then, after it includes China and its feathers are abundant, it will definitely determine the US and the Soviet Union as hypothetical enemies, and choose one of the countries to take advantage of the gap. So how can the US and the Soviet Union end up taking care of themselves alone? Weighing this benefit and this crisis, although what US Senator Fish asked yesterday may not have any solid basis, the politicians of the US and the Soviet Union should eliminate any questions and difficulties and promote strong parallel actions between the two countries. If they can do this, I believe it will definitely benefit the international community.</p>

<p>Stockholm - The Third Reich of Hitler now seems to be moving forward with the goal of establishing a German-dominated European economic front. The new trade agreement between Germany and Sweden was signed here yesterday. Informed sources believe that this agreement has broad commercial implications. Germany has once again won a victory on the diplomatic front without relying on force. The leaders in Berlin have long sought to cooperate with this neutral and strong country on the Scandinavian Peninsula. Therefore, this new convention is the highest achievement of the diplomatic development of both parties. After this, there will be an important expansion of business between the two countries, and Germany's control of the Scandinavian countries will in fact be achieved as a result.

<p>London. A major air battle took place over the Channel yesterday. Multiple sources claim that at least ten aircraft were shot down. Approximately 150 aircraft were involved. Initially, about thirty German bombers, escorted by fighters, attacked, dropping several batches of bombs, but they were far off target. Anti-aircraft guns opened fire fiercely. British fighters also engaged in combat. When the British fighters drove away the enemy bombers, a squadron of German fighters, hiding in the upper clouds for protection, swooped down and strafed with gunfire. Other Spitfire British fighters also ascended, encircling the German aircraft from behind. After a fierce battle, the German aircraft were eventually driven away. At that time, the sky was filled with aircraft. Anti-aircraft guns fired within a radius of several miles. One aircraft of unidentified origin crashed. According to reports from reporters on the southern coast, at least ten aircraft were seen crashing into the sea. In less than three minutes of combat between German bombers and British fighters, three were shot down by the British and fell straight into the sea. Another aircraft had its tail hit. In addition, a bomber and a fighter collided in mid-air. Furthermore, several German aircraft were severely damaged, with smoke billowing from their tails, and turned back towards the French coast, but they may not be able to reach their original defenses. (11th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London. An Air Ministry communique stated that British Air Force fighter squadrons of Spitfires and Hurricanes had inflicted heavy damage on attacking German aircraft yesterday, shooting down fourteen German bombers and fighters.

By yesterday evening, the enemy bombers and escorting fighters encountered by British Spitfire and Hurricane aircraft numbered about seventy. After shooting down six German aircraft, British pilots also destroyed eight German fighters and one bomber in several engagements, with no British losses. These Spitfire fighters were patrolling near the British coast when they discovered seventy German aircraft, flying at altitudes ranging from 6,000 to 12,000 feet. Three British aircraft immediately attacked one of the squadrons, and the air battle ensued. German aircraft dropped bombs on a city in the southeast today, causing minor casualties.

It was reported that a squadron of fifteen German bombers first bombarded the convoy. They swooped down amidst the anti-aircraft fire from the escorting ships and dropped high-explosive bombs, which fell like rain, but none seemed to hit their target. The German aircraft were then driven away by British Air Force fighters. Ten minutes later, a squadron of about thirty German coal-fired aircraft was seen flying over the Channel at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet, dropping several batches of bombs, which landed near the convoy. Fighters appeared everywhere in the sky, and the German fighters that were escorting them were attacked by British squadrons and encountered heavy fire from anti-aircraft guns within a radius of several miles along the coast.

<p>German Air Force Boasts of Combat Techniques</p>
<p>Berlin. A Huitong Agency reporter recently learned the following from Berlin officials: "The excellent techniques of the German Air Force were fully proven during the war in France. The current operations against Britain further demonstrate the high level of their techniques. For example, the fact that twelve British aircraft were completely shot down by our aircraft in Stavanger on the 9th of this month is further proof. According to the news received yesterday, the group of British aircraft that invaded the Calais airfield was also completely shot down by our aircraft. Among them, seven bombers did not get close to the airfield due to the dense fire of our anti-aircraft guns and fled. They indiscriminately dropped bombs along the way, so the military losses were very light. After the anti-aircraft fire stopped, our fighter planes engaged them in air combat, shooting them down one by one until they were all wiped out. Our aircraft suffered no losses."

<h3 id="e34">British Navy Attempts to Attack Italian Coast in the Mediterranean; After Brief Contact Near Crete, British Fleet Eventually Retreats to the Southeast <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Rome. It was announced here last night that, regarding the naval battle near Crete, on the afternoon of July 8, Italian reconnaissance aircraft spotted a British fleet in the Mediterranean Sea sailing west in three groups, consisting of three battleship-class main battleships, one aircraft carrier, and multiple cruisers and destroyers. At that time, Italian submarines, with agile movements, sailed to the area and immediately sank one British destroyer, and immediately reported the route and speed of the enemy ships, confirming that the British ships had attempted to attack the Italian coast. However, from the evening of the 8th to the afternoon of the 9th, the actual movements of the enemy ships were still unknown. At that time, the Italian fleet in the Ionian Sea was fully prepared to meet the British ships. When the Italian fleet was concentrated in Calabria, it was bombed by enemy aircraft, but as a result, five aircraft were shot down. At 2:00 PM that afternoon, after the enemy aircraft were repelled, the main force of the British fleet was sighted. Italian destroyers immediately opened fire on them. The Italian battleships "Cesare" and "Cavour," both weighing 23,000 tons and equipped with ten 32-centimeter guns, also participated in the battle, facing three American main battleships weighing 31,000 tons, each equipped with eight 38-centimeter guns. The distance between the two sides was 26 kilometers. The Italian ships fired extremely quickly and accurately, inflicting heavy damage on the British ships, one of which, a main battleship, was severely damaged. At the same time, three British bombers were also shot down. At that time, British and Italian aircraft had also engaged in air combat. Italian aircraft bombed enemy ships with great success. After fifteen minutes, the enemy could not withstand it and began to retreat to the southeast, and the attempt to attack the Italian coast was clearly abandoned. The Italian fleet then sailed back to its original base. (11th Huitong Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>British Fleet Commander Expresses Disappointment</p>
<p>London. A communique from the British Admiralty last night stated that, according to a report from the commander-in-chief of the British fleet in the Mediterranean Sea, the naval battle between the British and Italian navies in the Mediterranean was "a disappointing action" because the British fleet did not have the opportunity to inflict substantial damage on enemy ships at close range. The British fleet pursued the Italian fleet until land was in sight. It was unfortunate that the British fleet could not catch up with the Italian fleet before it sailed into the range of the shore batteries. British torpedo bombers, braving heavy anti-aircraft fire, attempted to prevent the Italian fleet from retreating and launched one torpedo, which hit an enemy cruiser. Italian officials have already issued a communique acknowledging that one Italian ship (likely a battleship) was hit by a 15-inch shell fired by a British ship. There were no casualties on British ships during the battle yesterday. A British submarine in another part of the Mediterranean Sea spotted an Italian submarine nearby and launched one torpedo, hitting it. Debris flew high, the bow of the submarine stood out of the water, the stern was below, and it immediately sank. (11th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Communique from Italian Air Force Chief of Staff</p>
<p>Rome. Italian Air Force Chief of Staff General Pricolo issued a statement to the soldiers today, stating, in summary, that Italian aircraft bombed British ships on the 8th and 9th, achieving decisive results.

<p>Rome. According to well-informed sources here last night, multiple Italian bombers, escorted by destroyers, bombed the naval base, arsenals, and other facilities on Malta.

All Italian aircraft safely returned to their bases. (11th Huitong Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Cairo. A Royal Air Force communique stated that Italian aircraft attacked Malta yesterday and were intercepted by British fighters, causing two to catch fire and crash.

<p>Stockholm. The Swedish government issued a formal report yesterday regarding the British attack on four Swedish destroyers, one supply ship, and one ship carrying refugees. The formal report was issued after the destroyers returned to Swedish territorial waters yesterday morning. The four destroyers were built by Italy. The refugee transport ship was the Patrasia and the supply ship was the Kastor. The report stated that the ships encountered special difficulties and various obstacles during their voyage. The most serious accident occurred in the Faroe Islands on June 20. On that day, the ships were intercepted by British ships. Because they were not fully armed, they could not resist the British ships. After the Swedish government lodged a serious protest with London, the ships were released by the British. It has now been determined that the destroyers were severely damaged. The British government has declared its willingness to compensate for all losses and has apologized, stating that the incident was due to a misunderstanding. The German naval authorities provided great assistance to the ships' voyage, pointing out the location of minefields and safe waterways. The refugee transport ship was heading to Ireland to evacuate 200 Swedish expatriates. When it departed, the destroyer and refugee ship had to postpone their departure due to the oil tanker Kastor being detained by the French, as they had no fuel. After protests, the French released the oil tanker. It is said that the British government, fearing that Swedish warships might be captured by the German navy and used to attack Britain, had no choice but to take this measure.

<p>London. A communique from the Admiralty stated that mines have been laid in the waters between the Orkney Islands and Iceland, and between Iceland and Greenland. This mine placement constitutes a defensive curtain between Norway and Iceland, as Norway is a concentration point for German troops, and the Icelandic side, according to yesterday's official warning, is also in danger of being invaded at any time. This mine placement is sufficient to protect Iceland from being occupied by the Germans and cutting off the British and American sea lanes. If this mine placement is effective, it can also prevent German fleets from entering the Atlantic Ocean. Currently, the British Navy is engaged in combat with the Italian and French navies, making it particularly necessary to prevent German ships from entering the Atlantic.

This constitutional change will be approved by the national people and then passed by the Senate and House of Representatives, which will be established soon. The government will devote itself to this important work, especially to solving the refugee problem and preparing for peace." The ministers present yesterday, in addition to Deputy Prime Minister Laval, included Minister Without Portfolio Achard, Minister of the Interior Marquet, Minister of Foreign Affairs Baudouin, Minister of Public Works Frossard, and Minister of Labor Pomaret. (11th Huitong Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Vichy. Laval declared yesterday at a preparatory meeting of the National Assembly that the new French constitution will be approved by a citizen referendum. Laval continued, stating that Prime Minister General Petain, due to his old age and frail health, cannot personally attend various meetings, so he entrusted him to attend parliamentary meetings and the National Assembly on his behalf. (11th Huitong Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>London. London newspapers are all commenting on the problem of the new French regime. The Daily Telegraph said that Petain's cabinet undoubtedly believes that basely imitating dictators can obtain some concessions as a reward. This is a big mistake, because Petain initially thought that by first declaring unconditional surrender, he could obtain a glorious peace from Hitler, but this has now become a pipe dream. The French people may need some time to realize the truth of their pain, but the chains imposed on them now will certainly not be able to confine the spirit that has illuminated the progress of mankind for thousands of years for long. The News Chronicle, discussing the future French referendum, said, "Under the arrangements of the Nazi stage, everything will proceed very smoothly." A large part of France is now occupied by the German army, and the rest is controlled by Petain's fascists. French people must have a heroic spirit to dare to say no, and even if there are many heroes, the numbers can still be fabricated. (11th Reuters dispatch)</p>

On the contrary, Romania has been involved in political actions that are detrimental and useless, far from Romania's true will, and its friendship with neighboring countries has deteriorated day by day.

<p>London. Oil industry insiders here have not confirmed the rumor in Bucharest that the British are planning to sell their Romanian oil interests to the Soviet Union. London believes that not only would the Soviet Union be unwilling to buy something it can control politically, but also British officials would not allow it. Most of the British oil technicians have now left Romania, but the executive and administrative personnel are temporarily staying. The oil that is still being produced, how it will be handled, even the oil companies themselves are unsure. However, it is believed that the oil produced is no longer being transported to Constanta as usual, but is instead being transported inland, or to Germany and Italy. The Romanian authorities have expelled all personnel who could sabotage British oil wells. Romanian exports to England are now scarce. British oil companies cannot now remit profits to England, but they can still maintain telegraphic communication between London and their personnel in Romania. (11th Huitong Agency dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e47">President Roosevelt Declares No Troops to Be Sent to European War; Asks Congress to Approve Huge Defense Budget; Expand Army, Navy, and Air Force to Defend the Americas <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt sent a special message to Congress today, requesting the approval of an additional $4,848,000,000 for defense expenditures. The President stated that, "We do not want to use our military equipment in wars of aggression, nor do we want to send our troops to participate in the European war." Such a huge defense expenditure is a sacrifice, and such a great defense program is a hard work, that is, the whole country participates in defense. Including this resolution, the defense expenditures that President Roosevelt has requested Congress to approve during this congressional term amount to about 10 billion yuan. According to the President's message, the use of this expenditure is as follows: (1) To strengthen the navy until the navy can cope with the combined navy of the enemy; (2) To fully equip the army of 1.2 million people; (3) To store tanks, guns, and ammunition that can be used for another 800,000 troops (that is, the army can be increased to 2 million people if necessary); (4) To provide private and state-owned manufacturing plants with the necessary facilities to produce equipment for 2 million troops and military supplies in the sea, land, and air programs; (5) To manufacture 15,000 new aircraft for the army and 4,000 for the navy, including prepared engines, armament, and new equipment. The President said that the United States is deeply aware of the threat of new methods of concealing the intelligence of enslaved people. Now this threat is becoming more frequent, and its malice is becoming more obvious. The American people are increasingly determined to meet this threat with complete and adequate defense. "We have now seen many countries succumb to the military power of aggressor nations, some of which have been defeated by internal traitors. We have also seen countries encouraged by the hope of final victory, still fighting loyally to resist the aggressor. We oppose war. Not only do the American people know this, but the people of the world know this. We do not want to participate in the European war, but we want to prevent aggression against the United States or the Western Hemisphere. The American people and members of Congress are aware that the threats to their freedom, security, life, religion, politics, and international credibility are increasing and becoming more serious. The maintenance of democracy in the United States is by no means a sign of American weakness. The free people of the United States are determined not only to maintain their freedom, but also to become stronger. Those who speak for dictatorship and those who are willing to fail or advocate moderation believe that we have not devoted all our efforts to preparing for war, and therefore we cannot defend ourselves at present. They refute this statement as untrue." Army Chief Johnson estimates that, according to the army expansion plan proposed by the President, the U.S. Army will have a total of 24,591 aircraft in January next year. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt guaranteed yesterday that the United States would not send troops to participate in the European war. At the same time, he promised that the United States would have "the largest defense war machine ever seen by mankind" to defend the United States and the entire Western Hemisphere. This "total defense" plan of President Roosevelt's is included in the special message he delivered to Congress yesterday. He requested an additional $4,848,171,000 to add 19,000 new fighters to the army and navy and to quickly complete the various agencies of the U.S. national defense. This bill will increase the number of U.S. warplanes to 35,000. President Roosevelt told Congress that the European war has taught the United States a lesson: "Partial defense is not enough." President Roosevelt's message stated, "If the United States must have defense equipment, then it should be a complete defense." (United Press, 11th)</p>

<p>Chicago: The Democratic Party's People's Convention is about to begin. According to the most reliable sources, President Roosevelt will be the Democratic Party's presidential candidate. The Democratic Party's vice-presidential candidate will probably be Representative Bankhead of Alabama. In addition, hopeful vice-presidential candidates include Senator Byrnes of South Carolina and Senator Barkley of Kentucky. Secretary of State Hull and Federal Security Administrator McNutt are also among the vice-presidential candidates, but their voices are not as high as those of the aforementioned people. At the same time, Senator Wheeler, who has always opposed President Roosevelt's third term, originally had hopes of becoming a presidential candidate. However, he has refused to form a third party to support him as an independent presidential candidate. Senator Wheeler predicts that the Democratic Party's resolution platform will have a strong anti-war tendency. If so, then he will not withdraw from the party. Senator Wheeler also stated that his plan in Chicago will depend on President Roosevelt's actions. He said, "If the President formally accepts to be a candidate, then I will abandon this plan, because no one can compete with the President." It is widely believed that the only way to allow Farley, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, to continue his political work is to nominate Secretary of State Hull as the presidential candidate and make Farley his deputy. Farley had been conducting his campaign in silence until two weeks ago, because he and other political experts believed that Roosevelt was determined to run for a third term. Farley, Wheeler, and McNutt privately exchanged views, believing that the President is currently experiencing difficulties because he has been too silent on the issue of re-election, causing countless speculations among Democrats. Roosevelt's silence has made the candidates in the party stand still. Now, Roosevelt has no other good way except to be a candidate, because time does not allow for the creation of another hopeful candidate. (United Press, 11th)</p>

<p>Tokyo: Authoritative observers here say that the Japanese political situation will soon reach a decisive juncture. This can be seen from Konoe's recent request that the Yonai cabinet express its attitude towards the "political renovation" movement he is presiding over, and from Army Minister Hata Shunroku's soliciting opinions from army generals on strengthening the southward advancement policy. According to Konoe, the government must actively participate in the movement to reform Japan's political structure. In the new structure, military, legislative, and administrative powers should be unified. He has informed the government and the military of this view, but this movement is not aimed at the Yonai cabinet. According to commentators with inside knowledge of the political world, Konoe has no intention of overthrowing the Yonai cabinet and succeeding as prime minister before the formation of a single political party. Although Yonai and Konoe are both trying to get closer to each other on domestic issues, the military's particularly firm attitude towards the current foreign policy is actually an obstacle to this. And if Konoe's movement to establish a new political structure does not pay due attention to the military's attack on Foreign Minister Arita's so-called "status quo" diplomacy, it is unlikely to succeed. According to the Japan Times, Army Minister Hata Shunroku will soon visit Prime Minister Yonai to discuss the military's request to change foreign policy and reform the political structure. It is reported that the army and navy authorities have fully understood the golden opportunity that the European war has given them to accelerate the implementation of the southward advancement policy. However, before this policy is implemented, it is obviously necessary to strengthen the domestic structure, and it is necessary to be less formal in diplomacy and not to be too concerned about third countries. Moreover, the military is particularly opposed to Arita's "verbal diplomacy" and firmly demands the adoption of the principle of "action first." The reason is that Arita has repeatedly issued statements to maintain the status quo of the Dutch East Indies. In the eyes of the military, this is an obstacle to Japan's economic demands on the archipelago. Therefore, it has formed an action plan with the naval authorities and insists that the government should implement this plan as soon as the opportunity is ripe, regardless of whether Britain and the United States have any objections.

<h3 id="e55">British Naval Strategy in the Mediterranean <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Translated from the original by British Navy Admiral Sir Bacon</p>
<p>Naval strategy, it can be said, is consistent now, in the past, and in the future. Its sole objective lies in securing control of the sea; allowing the ships of friendly and neutral nations to pass unhindered, while enemy ships, whether warships or merchant vessels, are subject to blockade.</p>
<p>Although naval strategy remains unchanging, the complexities of "sea control" increase with each passing year. In the Napoleonic era, the aim was to engage and defeat the enemy fleet, or to blockade their warships in port, rendering them harmless; then, using frigates to protect the shipping of one's own merchant vessels, one had achieved sea control. By the time of the European War, this task had become greatly complicated by the influence of submarines, mines, and torpedoes, necessitating underwater protection measures. Currently, due to the activity of the air force, this task has become even more difficult. The air force not only serves as the eyes and ears for the offense and defense of ships but can also attack ships. To a certain extent, they can also undermine naval sea control by rapidly transporting forces to destroy targets in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Therefore, the modern concept of thorough sea control must encompass control of the sea, underwater, and the air. However, the degree of complexity has intensified, to the point that in some seas, control is simply impossible. This is due to international law, which stipulates that all ships, whether neutral or belligerent, are permitted to move freely within the three-mile territorial sea limit.</p>
<p>British strategy in the Mediterranean must be contingent on the situations with both allies and enemies. The most problematic issue at present is, of course, Italy. Under these circumstances, the focus should be on blockading the Mediterranean, halting the entry and exit of ships. Furthermore, it would be best to completely blockade the Suez Canal, partially blockade the Dardanelles Strait, and completely block the entrance to Gibraltar. As for traffic between ports in the Mediterranean, generally speaking, it can be disregarded.</p>
<p>For almost five months of each of the past fifteen years, I have resided in Italy, getting to know many of their naval officers, especially senior officers. I dare say they are all outstanding, astute, courageous, and very progressive. In recent years, they have made even greater progress in the art of commanding warships in battle. Advances in long-range gunnery and underwater sound detection have increased fourfold. The Italian Navy has its own hereditary characteristics, quite different from the German Navy. If Britain were to engage Italy in naval warfare, it is difficult to be certain they would not demonstrate their capabilities, quite unlike the German Navy.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Italian Navy has spent considerable sums annually on building submarines and high-speed motor torpedo boats. The threat of submarines has been greatly diminished in the past few months because our sailors have become much more proficient in detecting and destroying submarines; however, they remain extremely dangerous, especially when used in the narrow waters between Sicily and the African coast. High-speed motorboats are too noisy to be considered weapons of significant value; moreover, they cannot be operated in slightly adverse weather conditions.</p>
<p>British merchant ships have already changed their routes through the Mediterranean. This has made things much easier for the navy. At this point, the only task for British warships is to engage Italian ships at sea or prevent their movement, which is all that is required. Italy's geographical location, with its air force bases in Sicily, Tripoli, and Libya, makes it ideally suited to attack British merchant ships passing through the narrow areas of the Mediterranean. However, if there are no merchant ships to attack, this location is wasted.</p>
<p>Italy's weakness lies in its possession of three colonies. Eritrea and Abyssinia can only be reached via the Red Sea. Britain can immediately blockade them three miles outside the Suez Canal, cutting off their lines of communication. Then, arm the natives of Abyssinia; a large number of them are already prepared to fight Italy. Also, draw troops from the Middle Eastern armies to attack Addis Ababa. The second colony, Libya, is a coastal strip from Egypt to Tunisia, and British air and naval forces can attack Italian troop or supply transports to Tripoli.</p>
<p>Malta will become an extremely useful air force base, where intelligence on enemy movements can be obtained, allowing British patrols to be on alert. The island will inevitably be subjected to repeated enemy bombings. However, countless anti-aircraft gun positions have already been set up along the island's ports and at Marsa. If the equipment is lawful and sufficient in quantity, these anti-aircraft guns and fighter aircraft can prevent enemy bombers from flying over the harbor.</p>
<p>Italy's third colony is the Dodecanese Islands, located in the southern Aegean Sea. These islands are not only of no use to Italy but expose her weaknesses, as, like other isolated islands, they must be defended by warships during wartime, and these ships would have long since become useless.</p>
<p>The Italian Air Force is very strong and can be a great help to its national defense, but Britain can also use aircraft to counter its aircraft, and British air force fighters have proven their abilities and courage in this war. Italian submarines are a danger that must be carefully guarded against, but this weapon is now easier to destroy, quite unlike during the last war.</p>
<p>Attacking Italian ports is also easy to undertake, and bombing could be carried out on 大蘭杜. If Italy's main navy is defeated by the British, then the ports of the Adriatic Sea will be vulnerable to the enemy. But it should be noted here that warships and fortresses cannot be compared. Warships can be sunk, but fortresses cannot. It takes eighteen months to two and a half years to build a warship; the construction of a fortress can be completed as soon as the cement is piled up; a warship costs from one and a half million to six million pounds, while a strong fortress costs only a little over one hundred thousand pounds.</p>
<p>If the British Navy can encounter and defeat the Italian Navy in the Mediterranean, then Italy will only have one railway in the north to supply coal and other necessities. At that time, she will certainly understand that the British blockade, and the starvation suffered by her and her territories, can bring the Mediterranean war to an early end.</p>

<p>The healthy appearance of children in the cities is a good symbol of Spain. The reporter once inspected a children's center during lunchtime. It was an institution that managed duties for families and mothers from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM. It combined a kindergarten, elementary school, hospital, and boarding house, with beautiful young ladies of noble birth doing chores. At one end of the building, two hundred and fifty girls were dining at tables set with shining tablecloths. At the other end was the dining room for boys of the same age. In their plates were generous portions of eggs, fish, and mashed potatoes. When the female instructor opened the door to lead me in, every child who had not finished eating stood straight up from their chair and extended their right hand in salute.</p>
<p>This institution was founded during the war with the aim of reducing the suffering of children. But later, the children's mothers found it very convenient. Many mothers who had to manage their children at home continued to send them to this institution. All expenses of this institution were paid by the government and were intended for the poor. Those children who were chauffeured by drivers every morning and evening were not allowed to attend.</p>
<p>Spanish workers, with a compassion that is both pitiable and heroic, spare no effort whenever they have the opportunity. Spain's dictator, Franco, often acknowledges this point, saying that the Spanish people's willingness to work is Spain's priceless treasure. With such a treasure, coupled with perseverance, and the elimination of intellectual revolution, Spain's economic recovery is only a matter of time.</p>

<p>(Lishui Correspondence) Director Xu Shaodi of the Zhejiang Department of Education attaches great importance to education in the Western Zhejiang Guerrilla Zone. He personally visited various counties in the Western Zhejiang Guerrilla Zone last month for an inspection. It is now known that the Department of Education has prepared a detailed plan for the restoration of education in the Western Zhejiang Guerrilla Zone and will also make active efforts to promote the overall education of the province. The reporter called on Mr. Xu and received the following information:</p>
<p>Find Ways to Increase Education Funds in the Guerrilla Zone</p>
<p>(1) The lives of elementary school teachers in the guerrilla zone are the most difficult. Although some counties close to the front lines have managed to raise funds this year, it is a drop in the bucket and may not be enough. The lives of social education personnel serving in the guerrilla zone are also equally difficult. Due to the financial difficulties of the provincial treasury, this year, in addition to implementing some new projects, the funds for other education and cultural education undertakings can only be listed according to the number of the previous year. Therefore, we can only hope that the central government will provide relief. The various difficulties in the guerrilla zone have been reported to the Ministry of Education, and the central government is very concerned about this. According to a letter from a friend in the Ministry of Education, the subsidy for elementary school teachers and other efforts in the occupied areas has been included in this year's national budget and has been approved by the Executive Yuan. The amount to be allocated to this province has not yet been ordered. This money will be entirely allocated to subsidize those working hard in the education sector in the guerrilla zone. The Department is currently planning to set up a Guerrilla Zone Education Guidance Office in potential locations. In addition to increasing supervisory personnel, we will also find ways to establish contact with all parties. The plan is being submitted to the Ministry for approval. A portion of the funds is also expected to be allocated by the Ministry. After the establishment of the office, it will be easier to carry out work.</p>
<p>The Fourth Temporary Middle School Will Be Added in Western Zhejiang</p>
<p>(2) Three temporary middle schools have already been established in Western Zhejiang. The Second Temporary Middle School has been approved to recruit female students from the next semester. It is difficult for young people in Jiashan to travel far to Changhua and Qian due to transportation issues. The Fourth Temporary Middle School could not be established last semester due to a lack of funding. Repeated requests have been made to establish a national middle school, but they have not been realized. The Provincial Government has approved the addition of the Fourth Temporary Middle School in Western Zhejiang this year. The Department has appointed Guerrilla Education Supervisor Wang Can to prepare for it. The location is planned to be in the Yuyao area.</p>
<p>Increase the Salaries of Teachers and Staff in Provincial Middle Schools</p>
<p>(3) The standard of living expenses for teachers and staff in provincial middle schools is based on the standard of living expenses for civil servants. However, this year's budget for education and cultural undertakings must still be allocated according to the approved amount of the previous year. The number of classes in each school has naturally increased, and the number of publicly funded students has also increased accordingly. It is impossible to stop any part of the existing undertakings, so it is impossible to allocate funds uniformly. All of the school's expenditures, except for equipment and office expenses, are all teachers' salaries. For this reason, it is fundamentally impossible to reach a standard of treatment similar to that of civil servants. Principal Shen of the Provincial Shaoxing Middle School once wrote to me, saying that four or five teachers in the school had changed to eating two thin porridge meals a day and could not even get full. The principals of various schools, due to many actual difficulties, have asked to submit a request to the Provincial Government for relief. The colleagues in the Provincial Government, aware of the real situation, have decided to allocate another 80,000 yuan from August to the end of the year, which will be distributed to the schools at the discretion of the Department of Education as salary subsidies. The salary standards of each school can only be implemented from the next semester. In addition, the salaries of teachers in vocational schools have been ordered by the Ministry of Education to be allocated separately by the Ministry of Education. As for the treatment of teachers and staff in the affiliated primary schools, there were previous methods. The treatment of English professors and lecturers will also be increased appropriately from the next semester.</p>
<p>Actively Rectify Public and Private Middle Schools</p>
<p>(4) The number of middle school students in this province was 31,000 before the war. It dropped to 16,000 in the 26th year and has now increased to more than 40,000. The number of students entering junior high school has increased compared to before. In addition to the provincial Yan Middle School, Qu Middle School, Tai Middle School, and Shao Middle School, which have added high schools, the private Shufan Middle School, the private Sanyi Middle School, the private Huipu Middle School, and the newly established Xinqun Middle School have been approved to establish high schools this year. After inspection, some of the county-run private middle schools or temporary middle schools will be adjusted. Some middle schools are not well-managed and only mislead young people. Those who have been repeatedly ordered to improve but have not complied will be suspended if necessary. For example, a certain middle school's finances are not public at all, the content is corrupt, and some teachers and staff do not know how to respect themselves. When the Department sent personnel to inspect, it was already mid-morning, and some students were still sleeping soundly. There were even playing cards on their desks. The situation of daily teaching can be imagined. It is truly a great stain on the education sector that such strange phenomena still exist in the education sector. It is heartbreaking that young people are still belittling themselves at a time when national affairs are in crisis.</p>
<h3 id="e59">School News <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Southeast Girls' Middle School The Southeast Girls' Elementary and Middle School, formerly located in the city center, moved to No. 20 Wangjiasha Garden Road after the war. The school is well-managed and has been recognized by the authorities, so the Bureau of Works has agreed to provide subsidies. In order to avoid increasing the burden on parents, the school will not increase tuition fees next semester, remaining at 22 yuan for junior high school, 13 yuan for upper elementary school, 8 yuan for middle elementary school, and 7 yuan for lower elementary school, while teachers' salaries will be increased by 30%. In order to improve students' English conversation skills, the school has hired a Westerner to teach English conversation from the next semester. The school is scheduled to hold an entrance examination on July 14, and registrations have been quite enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Jishan Middle School Jishan Middle School, located at the intersection of Gordon Road and Xinzha Road, is known for its strict teaching and outstanding achievements. It has recently been heard that the school will hire many Chinese and Western teachers for teaching from the next semester. The autumn new student entrance examination will be held on July 20th. The number of applicants is very high. In addition, the summer school attached to the school has already started, and there are still vacancies.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Surprise in the Hezhong Cup, Shanghang Loses, Tianhang Wins After a Thrilling Battle, Bailuo B Wins Zhongyi <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>In the eighth match of the Hezhong Cup Charity Basketball Tournament held yesterday, Tianhang defeated Shanghang by a score of 43 to 39 in the second group of the first division, creating the first major upset since the start of the Hezhong Cup. Shanghang had previously defeated Zhongyi and Xihua in this tournament, demonstrating great momentum. Tianhang encountered the strong team Bailuomen in the first match, resulting in a defeat. But in yesterday's meeting, Shanghang initially showed great enthusiasm, with Zhou Xuan, Li Wende, and Lian Zhu launching attacks, scoring repeatedly. Tianhang was too cautious, only following Shanghang's lead. But Tianhang became more and more courageous, with Xu Shengrong and Dong Shouchun scoring repeatedly. In this extremely tense atmosphere, the first half finally ended in a 21-21 tie. After changing sides, the difference between the two sides did not exceed five points. At 33-31, Tianhang had already come from behind. Shanghang's morale gradually declined, and fouls became frequent. Shanghang's main player, Ye Zuyun, was also sent off for four fouls, making the situation even worse. At the end of regulation time, Shanghang was finally defeated by Tianhang by a score of 39 to 43 with a four-point difference. Bailuo B and Zhongyi, Zhongyi was already in the minds of the audience as Bailuo's enemy. After entering the court, the situation was immediately controlled by Bailuo. At the end of the first half, Bailuomen led by a score of 29 to 11, a lead of as much as eighteen points. After the rematch, Bailuomen was still sharp. Only Zhongyi's Dong Shaotang broke free and scored as many as seven goals. In total, the result was 60 to 46, and Bailuo B won a great victory. However, in the first five minutes of the second half, Zhongyi player Yuan Shirui had a violent action and was ordered to leave the court by referee Zheng Zhifang. The organizers expressed deep regret about this, but because they were both serving the charity cause, they decided to give special tolerance. However, in order to rectify discipline, they issued a serious warning that if he re-offends, he will be deprived of his permanent right to participate in the Hezhong Cup.</p>

<h3 id="e66">The "Shengjing" Steamer, Carrying Munitions, Was Detained by the Japanese Authorities Last Night Upon Arrival; No Definite Statement Has Been Made Regarding Confiscation; The Details of Negotiations Regarding This Case Have Also Not Been Released <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The British firm Butterfield &amp; Swire's "Shengjing" steamer, which departed from Tianjin on the 9th and returned to Shanghai, carried munitions from the French army in Tianjin destined for Shanghai. Upon arrival, the Japanese navy ordered the ship to stop for inspection. The steamer disregarded the order and sailed directly to Shanghai. The Japanese military, considering this deliberate evasion, dispatched a small vessel to intercept it. It was detained on the Huangpu River near Lujiazui and towed to the Wusongkou anchorage. Passengers disembarked from the ship and went ashore on the afternoon of the 10th, as reported in previous news.</p>
<p>Unloading Munitions</p>
<p>It was learned yesterday that the company dispatched two "Huatong" lighters on the day before yesterday to first unload the fruit. As no agreement was reached at that time, they remained alongside the "Shengjing" overnight. Unloading began at dawn yesterday, but at around 10:00 AM, the Japanese military ordered a halt to the unloading and directed them to leave. Several other lighters approached the ship and began unloading the munitions. The lighters unloading fruit returned to Shanghai at around 2:00 PM, reportedly having unloaded only half of it. It is now known that the munitions were completely unloaded by 4:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>Arrival of the "Shengjing"</p>
<p>The "Shengjing" steamer entered port at 5:25 PM (Customs time) and arrived at the company's wharf in the French Concession at 7:45 PM. The company instructed it to dock at Wharf No. 1 on the Bund outside Avenue Edward VII. Night labor was used to unload the cargo last night. The ship is scheduled to set sail for Tianjin, and also to call at Weihaiwei and Yantai, at noon tomorrow (Saturday). The originally scheduled departure date of Saturday will not be affected. The rumors that gold bars were found by the Japanese military are completely false. As for the rumors that the munitions have been confiscated, that remains to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Negotiations Between the Two Parties</p>
<p>A British naval spokesperson told reporters yesterday that the Japanese authorities, based on the grounds that the "Shengjing" steamer disobeyed orders and refused to stop, lodged a protest with the British naval authorities. Both parties are currently engaged in "friendly" negotiations to resolve the matter. However, the spokesperson declined to disclose the details of the protest. The Japanese naval office also remained silent on the matter, stating only that some issues have been resolved. According to the English-language "China Press," a Japanese spokesperson stated at a press conference the day before yesterday that because China is engaged in a large-scale war of resistance against Japan, the Japanese side has the right to detain munitions destined for Chinese ports.</p>
<p>Disposition of Munitions</p>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reported that the Butterfield &amp; Swire's "Shengjing" steamer, carrying 794 cases of French army rifles from Tianjin, was detained by the Japanese naval authorities. The French and Japanese authorities in this city reached an agreement last night (the 10th) to transfer the rifles and ammunition onto a Japanese navy lighter. The "Shengjing" was then released nearly noon today (the 11th), having been detained at Wusongkou for over thirty-six hours. Whether these arms and ammunition will be returned to the French side is not yet known this morning. However, it is reported that the arms and ammunition will be held by the Japanese side until the matter is fully investigated. The British authorities have not yet protested the detention of the "Shengjing." The Butterfield &amp; Swire Company also refuses to state whether it will formally request the British authorities to pay attention to this matter.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Villagers of Chuansha Township Massacred; Chen Wanghe's Troops Collude with the Japanese Military; Conflict with Zhang Huifang's Subordinates <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Chen Wanghe's troops in Zhujiaqiao, Jiangzhen, and other areas within Chuansha County, originally subordinates of Zhang Huifang, harassed the local populace. Zhang's elder brother, Zhang Amao, led troops to suppress them. On the evening of the 4th, they ambushed Jiangzhen along the seawall. At midnight, they stormed Chen's "General Headquarters" stationed in a nunnery, encircling it. Artillery fire ensued, and a night battle lasted for two hours. Chen broke through the encirclement and fled in disarray, suffering over sixty deaths and dozens of injuries. Four nuns also fell victim to the calamity. Zhang's side also suffered over ten injuries but no deaths. They seized one heavy machine gun and over a hundred rifles. Chen's troops originally numbered only over two hundred, so they have been almost completely wiped out. He then</p>
<p>Cried to the Japanese on the 7th. The Japanese then dispatched four warships to patrol the Bailonggang area of Chuansha. At the same time, they dispatched 500 soldiers, transported from Gaomiao via a small train, to Qingdun, from which they marched to Gaozhaizi, six li east of Xijia Wharf. They set up small steel cannons and machine guns at various strategic crossroads and bombarded them. A large contingent of Japanese troops then launched an assault, while Chen's troops seized the opportunity to burn down the villages of Weijiazhai, Yanjiazhai, Liwang, turning them into scorched earth. They also massacred over 120 farmers, including Wei Guanshun, leaving corpses strewn across the fields. This is truly the most tragic scene for the populace since the August 13th Incident. At the time, women and children fled in terror, their cries shaking the heavens. In the days before yesterday and yesterday, the Japanese military continued their offensive, with aircraft flying reconnaissance missions over the coastal areas of Chuansha and Nanhui. The Japanese military also received guidance and set out from the location of Qin Xingyan's troops in Gaojiahang, to encircle the rear of Caijialukou, aiming to annihilate Zhang's troops in one fell swoop. Fortunately,</p>
<p>They had received prior warning. Faced with a vast disparity in strength, Zhang's troops, in order to preserve their strength, sailed to a certain location to await an opportunity to counterattack. This battle saw the Japanese military mobilize over a thousand troops with naval, land, and air forces, and under the power of warships, artillery, and aircraft, not a single guerrilla fighter was killed or wounded. Currently, transportation in the township is difficult, and the corpses are being collected and buried by the Chuansha Charity Hall. It is truly a great calamity.</p>

<p>The Daguan News Agency reports that according to reliable information from the shipping industry, two British merchant ships, the "Yongda" and "Yongfeng," which specialize in sailing along the Chinese coast, transporting goods, set sail from Shanghai earlier this month, loaded with cargo and bound for Fuzhou. While passing through the waters off Yongning, they were suddenly attacked by two Japanese warships, which fired over twenty rounds at the two merchant ships, causing significant damage to the ships' hulls. At the time, six Chinese crew members were killed by stray bullets and one was injured. The two shipping companies received telegrams and are currently investigating the matter.</p>

<p>A Japanese military spokesperson told reporters yesterday that the Japanese side has not yet received a response to its protest regarding the "maltreatment" of a Japanese military policeman by the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment last Sunday. He did not deny that if the U.S. side guarantees that there will be no similar "outrages" in the future, the Japanese side will consider it a reasonable response and this case will come to an end. In addition, U.S. Navy Fourth Marine Regiment Commander Colonel Beck sent a letter to Japanese Military Police Commander Miura yesterday morning. It is widely believed that the letter contains an expression of regret.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 11th: Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that after studying the detailed report of the July 7th arrest of a Japanese military policeman by U.S. sailors in the Shanghai International Settlement, he felt even more strongly that the matter should be resolved locally.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Admits Mistake for Entering Defense Zone</p>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reports that Japanese officials stated today that unless the U.S. side provides a guarantee that the same incident will not occur again in the future, they will not consider the matter closed. The Japanese authorities have admitted their mistake in not notifying the U.S. military authorities about the Japanese military policeman entering the U.S. military defense zone. However, the issue is not about that. What is being sought now is a guarantee that violence will not be used again in the future, as was the case with the U.S. soldiers on Sunday.</p>
<p>Beck Sent a Letter Expressing Regret</p>
<p>According to another source, U.S. military commander Colonel Beck recently sent a letter to Lieutenant General Miura, commander of the Japanese military police in Shanghai. It is widely believed that the letter expressed regret over the Sunday incident and promised to take steps to prevent the same incident from recurring in the future.</p>
<p>Japanese Residents Want Beck to Apologize</p>
<p>The "Continental Daily News" reports that one thousand Japanese residents in Shanghai held a meeting in Hongkou last night and passed a resolution urging the Japanese authorities to demand that Colonel Beck, commander of the U.S. Marines in Shanghai, publicly apologize before an "international body" for the alleged humiliation of a Japanese military policeman by U.S. soldiers on Sunday morning. However, the resolution did not specify which countries should be represented in this "international body." According to observers in this city, while the Japanese authorities have allowed the Japanese residents to hold a meeting, they hope to prevent the matter from escalating, as both Tokyo and Washington have indicated that they hope the matter will be resolved locally.</p>

<p>Since the Japanese military police, together with the French police, searched the residences and offices of Xu Maotang, manager of the China Remittance Bank, and Xu Yongzuo, an accountant, finding nothing, and still held the two in custody by the French police, it has aroused close attention from various circles of society. All consider Xu Maotang to be a legitimate businessman, with a solid financial background, and who is usually law-abiding and does not participate in external affairs. Although Xu Yongzuo cannot completely avoid external social engagements due to his professional duties, he is known for being strict with himself and executing his duties with great integrity. Therefore, he is often requested by society to review and certify important accounting matters to demonstrate great credibility, which has been the case for a long time. The details of the two's arrest were not reported in detail in the newspapers, and the reasons were unknown. The reporter, after several days of investigation from various sources, finally learned the content of this matter, which is actually a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Commissioned to Review Various Donations, Covered Up the Heard Cause. The origin of the matter was that after the August 13th Shanghai War, various circles in Shanghai had an organization of support associations. Among them, matters such as the review of accounts for the relief group, the medical group, and the national salvation donations were all entrusted to accountants for handling separately. Xu Yongzuo was one of those entrusted. After each donation collection agency received donations, it would send a notification letter to Xu Accountant's office for review, and then compile and publish the names and amounts of donors in the newspaper. From the standpoint of his position, it was impossible to shirk.</p>
<p>Account Books and Receipts Stored in the Bank, and the Work Stopped After the Withdrawal of the Chinese Army in October. However, all account books and receipts were feared that donors would need to check in the future, so it was inconvenient to destroy them. However, because the presiding personnel were scattered and no one was responsible for the assets, after discussion among the remaining members in Shanghai, three boxes of account books were stored in the Tianjin Road branch of the China Remittance Bank. On the one hand, the China Remittance Bank still has about 900,000 yuan in national salvation donations, which is funds managed by the National Salvation Donation Management Committee, and neither Xu is involved.</p>
<p>Changing the Account Name for Deposits, Someone Informed.</p>
<p>In the spring of this year, the China Remittance Bank received a letter from its chairman, Du Yuesheng, instructing that the name of the national salvation donation be canceled and replaced with a registered account name, which would be stored as before. Xu Maotang, in his position as manager, was ordered by the chairman, so he had to comply and save the Du letter as evidence. Unexpectedly, because of this change of account, someone secretly informed a certain party of this payment order and seal of the management committee, along with the Du letter, and said that the funds were being used to support guerrillas.</p>
<p>Arrested Together at Dawn on the 5th, the Japanese military police and the French police suddenly went to the residences and offices of the two Xus at dawn on the 5th of this month to search, but found nothing. However, in Xu Yongzuo's office, old diaries, photos, and draft regulations drafted for the Ministry of Industry and Commerce before 1931 were searched, all of which were irrelevant. The two were still taken to the police station and ordered to hand over all the seals, which were compared one by one with the seal list of the National Salvation Donation Management Committee, and none were related. However, the two were still kept at the police station, and then became ill due to the heat, so they were transferred to a certain hospital for treatment, and patrolmen were still sent to guard them.</p>
<p>The Chief Accountant of Zhonghui Was Also Arrested. Up until the day before yesterday, Lu Zhuying, the chief accountant of the China Remittance Bank, was also arrested by a certain party. Then, together with the Central Police Station of the Public Concession, Lu was taken to the Zhonghui branch on Tianjin Road, and the boxes of national salvation accounts stored in the warehouse were taken to the police station. Upon opening the boxes and inspecting them, there were no other related documents except receipts for donations from various circles and donation notices. The party wanted to take the account books away, but the police station refused to transfer them because they did not consider these account books to be any kind of information.</p>
<p>All Parties Concerned About Being Implicated Due to Public Service. However, almost all well-known and fair-minded people in society participated in the support association, and even more than several hundred million people donated money to the national salvation donations. Therefore, since this case occurred, the groups have been suspected and shocked, sincerely fearing that they will be implicated and speed up the process, creating a social terror phenomenon. Both Xu were implicated due to their positions and public service, so people from all walks of life are even more concerned about them. Since all the seals of the accounting firm were taken away, the entrusted cases could not be carried out and were at a standstill. It is verified that this donation has nothing to do with the two Xus, and since the withdrawal of the Chinese army to the west, no penny has been embezzled, but on the contrary, it has increased due to the transfer of interest over time. The truth of the Mu case is nothing more than that, but the two Xus are still detained in the hospital, unable to be free, and are truly implicated a lot.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Unlicensed Silver Houses and Money Shops to be Banned <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>In the corner of Shanghai, the number of silver houses has recently reached hundreds, and there are countless in the process of brewing. Most of them are located in Jiangxi Road, Sichuan Road, and other places in the Public Concession, because that place is the concentration of the financial industry. The business they operate is the buying and selling of various securities, as well as speculation in various countries' banknotes and the black market exchange rate, and the buying and selling of the dark market for gold. Because they have neither government supervision nor the guidance of the same industry, most of them engage in reckless speculation, which deteriorates society and runs counter to the government's wartime financial policy. After the Ministry of Finance received the report, it decided to ban silver houses and money shops that had not registered with the competent official in accordance with the law. At the same time, they are not allowed to join the industry association in accordance with the law. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency inquired with the banking industry yesterday and learned that according to Article 2 of the Banking Law, "Banks should be organized as companies, and may not be established without the approval of the Ministry of Finance." Article 46 stipulates that "If a bank opens without the approval of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Finance may order it to suspend business and impose a fine of not less than 1,000 yuan and not more than 5,000 yuan."</p>

<p>Biede, First Counselor of the German Embassy in China, who was the Chargé d'Affaires of the German Embassy in Chongqing after German Ambassador Trautmann left China, came to Shanghai from Chongqing on the 23rd of last month and stayed at the International Hotel. He has been here for more than ten days. He has recently visited various parts of Shanghai and is quite interested. According to a Daguan News Agency reporter, Biede's sudden departure from Chongqing to Shanghai is entirely a private trip and has no mission whatsoever. Former Ambassador Trautmann is currently staying in Berlin. According to well-informed sources, because Sino-German relations are becoming increasingly cordial and diplomatic relations have been restored and improved, the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs will actively strengthen its diplomatic presence in China in the near future.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Removal of Iron Net on North Henan Road, Traffic Opened Yesterday Morning; Only Pedestrians Allowed, Vehicles Still Prohibited; Grim Situation in Zhabei, Intolerable to Recall <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The intersection of North Henan Road and Boundary Road, which had been cut off for three years, was reopened to traffic at 5:00 AM yesterday morning. When the Shanghai war broke out, the Public Concession authorities erected a barbed wire obstacle on the Boundary Road according to the original iron fence (west from the end of North Zhejiang Road to the end of North Henan Road). The part that passed through the intersection of North Henan Road and Boundary Road has been completely removed, forming an access point. At both ends of the north side of the access point, two infantrymen of the Japanese "Concession Force" are stationed in guard posts. At the southeast end of the access point, one British soldier and one Concession patrolman are jointly stationed. Although pedestrians can still pass freely, various vehicles are generally prohibited from passing without "special credentials." Although those going to Zhabei no longer need to detour via Bazilu to Fuxing Road, very few people were entering and leaving the access point as of yesterday afternoon, because post-war Zhabei has become an almost uninhabited area. According to the British military authorities, the opening is from 5:00 AM to 10:00 PM every day. After 10:00 PM, no one is allowed to enter or leave without a special pass. A reporter from the Pingming News Agency specially entered Zhabei Baoshan Road through the access point yesterday afternoon and inspected the surrounding areas. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Road Bureau Building Completely Changed Its Appearance</p>
<p>The South Road Bureau Building (newly built after the January 28th Incident), which stands on the Boundary Road, has not suffered major damage due to the Shanghai war because it is close to the Concession and its construction is solid. Although the exterior shell is covered with bullet marks, the interior is still intact. It has now been occupied by the Japanese Marine Corps as the "Concession Force Headquarters," with hundreds of Japanese soldiers stationed inside. A Japanese naval flag is planted on the roof, and two fully armed Japanese soldiers are guarding the roof. However, the two radio antenna iron poles on the roof are dilapidated. The open space on the other side of the Road Bureau to Baoshan is dilapidated, the open space to the Ministry has also been designated as the "Concession Force Land," with barbed wire erected around it to prohibit idlers from passing. There are also Japanese soldier outposts near the "Concession Force Headquarters," such as at the intersection of Qiujiang Road and Baoshan Road, where two armed Japanese soldiers are stationed. In other places, such as north of Qiujiang Road, Baotong Road, Shixing Road, Zhonghua Xin Road, and Xiangshan Road, plainclothes puppet police are stationed. Except for Japanese military vehicles, no Japanese soldiers were found on the road.</p>
<p>Zhabei Patrol. The reporter continued north along Baoshan Road, from Zhonghua Xin Road to the Zhabei Northwest District of the Shanghai-Taicang Long-Distance Bus Road. Seventy to eighty percent of all the civilian houses have been destroyed by artillery fire. The ruins are desolate. The western wasteland in the middle section of Baoshan Road has been designated as the "Shanghai Military Police Construction Site," with barbed wire erected around it to prohibit passage. As for the old site of the Commercial Press Hall located at the intersection of Baoshan Road and Baotong Road, it has experienced "January 28th" and "August 13th"</p>
<p>Two rounds of artillery fire, so its remains are indescribable. However, because it is a reinforced concrete building, the outline still exists, but it is precarious, and pedestrians are very cautious when passing here. The Japanese military authorities set up a wooden sign near it, saying that transportation is prohibited in order to preserve this "war trace." As for the shops, in addition to the newly built "Yangtian Foreign Company," "Sugimoku ×× Shanghai Branch," and "Komiyama Factory" and other thirty shops south of Qiujiang Road, there are also Hua Yang merchant shops, such as the post office, which are extremely deserted. Although there are cars of the "China Railway Company" running on the long-distance bus road, most of the vehicles were left in the area by the Chinese side before the war, so they have become old and dilapidated. At the same time, because there are few passengers, only seven or eight each time. All the asphalt roads are uneven and full of garbage. In this hot summer,</p>
<p>The smell is overwhelming. At the same time, because all the iron covers of the central drainage ditches on all roads have disappeared, it is easy to fall into the roadside ditch if you are not careful when walking on the road. The Shanghai Memorial Monument for Police Officers Killed in the Past (inscribed by Wu Tiecheng) on Hongxing Road and Baoshan Road is still safe and sound. Although the water tower next to Baoshan Road still retains its outline, most of the metal objects inside have been dismantled and cannot be used.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Gas Prices to Increase from the Middle of the Month <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The British Shanghai Gas Company, due to soaring coal prices and other expenses, has also increased significantly. The fuel used has increased invisibly by two times due to the plummeting exchange rate. The total value of fuel purchased has increased by 4,360,642 yuan compared to 1939. Therefore, it applied to the Public Works Department to appropriately increase the surcharge of 10% on the basic price of gas. After repeated deliberations by the Public Utilities Committee and the Board of Directors of the Bureau, it was decided to increase it to 1.58 on bills for gas used up to and including July 16th of this year, or within the gas usage period after that date, for a period of three months. After three months, it will be reviewed again.</p>

<p>According to the Public Works Department's situation office, when the Public Works Department's Music Committee met on the 28th of last month, it discussed the issue of increasing the living allowance for the bureau's band musicians. The current salaries of the Public Works Department's musicians average between 200 and 300 yuan per month. It is not easy to maintain a livelihood. Therefore, the band captain submitted a request to the bureau to consider increasing the living allowance to show sympathy. When the case was discussed by the committee, some people suggested appropriately reducing the number of musicians so that the retained personnel could increase their salaries. The band captain stated that the current number of musicians in the team is already the bare minimum. If it is reduced, it will inevitably affect the effectiveness of the band, which is not appropriate. The living allowance currently received by the musicians is 40% of their salary, which is 25% less than that received by the bureau's general staff. In addition, only a few musicians have permanent part-time jobs. With the extreme increase in the cost of living, it is not enough to maintain it without an appropriate increase in the living allowance. After discussion, it was decided to increase the musicians' living allowance from 40% to 65% to show sympathy. The above resolution has been passed by the bureau's board of directors' regular meeting.</p>

<p>Since the situation in Hong Kong has become tense, the Chinese and Western residents evacuating from Hong Kong and arriving in Shanghai by ship have numbered around one thousand. Yesterday, a traveler who had just arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong told a Reuters reporter that tickets for various ships from Hong Kong to Shanghai were already sold out. Tickets for ships as far as the 24th of the month have also been purchased. Furthermore, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce has also begun registering Chinese residents to facilitate evacuation to ports such as Manila, Macau, and Haiphong if necessary. Recently, as the situation has become somewhat more relaxed, many are adopting a wait-and-see attitude, and some have even canceled their tickets and stopped their departure from Hong Kong. Also, telegraphic communications between Hong Kong and Vietnam, which had been temporarily interrupted, have now returned to normal due to the easing of the situation. According to reliable sources in the shipping industry in this city, ticket sales for ships departing from this city to Singapore in Southeast Asia suddenly stopped yesterday. A reporter from Pīnmíng News Agency learned that the most recent scheduled departure for Singapore from this city is the British company's Sanshia steamer on the 14th of this month. However, the company received a telegram from Hong Kong yesterday stating that ordinary tickets from Shanghai to Singapore would be suspended. Therefore, passengers from this city traveling to Singapore can only purchase tickets to Hong Kong. This is because after the ship arrives in Hong Kong from Shanghai, it will be requisitioned by the Hong Kong authorities to evacuate British women and children.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Fourteen Types of Daily Necessities Industries Restricted from Illegal Transactions: Large Quantities of Foreign Rice Arrive in Port Yesterday <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Grain, coal, oil, salt, Western medicine, Chinese medicine, cotton, yarn, silk fabric, paper, notebooks, sugar, general merchandise, hardware, and electrical materials—these fourteen industries, having been designated as important commercial sectors, have now received orders for their respective trade associations to prevent members from hoarding and speculating, as well as engaging in trading activities outside their primary business. The associations are also required to dispatch personnel to inspect and correct any issues at any time. All businesses involved in these sectors should publicly announce the wholesale and retail prices of their products at all times and are not allowed to engage in unfair competition with other businesses. The aim is to prevent hoarding and manipulation and to avoid affecting the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Appraisal</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Price Appraisal Committee, since holding its first appraisal meeting on the 9th of this month, has immediately appraised the highest prices for foreign rice for the three days from the 10th to the 12th and has announced it to the market for implementation. Now, the committee has set to convene its second price appraisal committee meeting at 3:00 PM today at the association's location at No. 15 Edward Road. At that time, the highest market trading prices for the three days of the 13th, 15th, and 16th (the market is closed on Sunday the 14th) will be appraised and implemented.</p>
<p>Subsidized Rice Sales</p>
<p>The Rice Dealers Association of this city, having been entrusted by the Subsidized Rice Sales Committee of this city, will continue to hold the fourth subsidized rice sales event on the 16th of this month. To discuss various methods and allocate the subsidized rice dealers, a meeting will be held at the association's location on Shanhai Pass Road at 3:00 PM this afternoon. It is said that the methods for this round of subsidized rice sales will be largely the same as the previous round. A total of sixty rice dealers in the two concessions will handle the sales (thirty selling tickets and thirty distributing rice). However, the distribution time may be changed due to the hot weather.</p>
<p>Rice Arrivals</p>
<p>Yesterday, a large amount of foreign rice arrived, totaling 77,458 bags transported by the Yusheng, Desheng, Yingzhou, Jiangsu, and Qiongzhou ships. Among them, 7,376 bags were shipped from Haiphong, while the rest were transported from Hong Kong. It is reported that the Taikoo Company's Chengdu ship also transported a large quantity, and the Liver pool ship also transported 16,000 bags of tribute rice. However, due to the late arrival of the ship in Shanghai yesterday, the exact number is unknown.</p>
<h3 id="e81">The Linji Coffin Transport Company is Accused of Destroying Corpses and Fraud: The Defendant Claims an Accident Occurred En Route Due to Wind; The Court Orders the Posting of a Thousand-Dollar Shop Guarantee for Further Inquiry <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The Linji Coffin Transport Company at No. 157 Rue Magne, French Concession, is owned by Zhang Deyi (48 years old this year) from Nantong. Recently, Wu Fatian, Yang Futian, Shen Baosheng, Mrs. Miao Zhang, Mrs. Yu Yin, Mrs. Li Lu, Xu Zhengkun, Shi Hongru, and others have hired lawyer Yu Bin to file a private prosecution with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, accusing him of setting up a sham company, fraud, breach of trust,</p>
<p>and the crime of destroying corpses, etc. The petition states that the plaintiffs entrusted the defendant's coffin transport company to transport coffins back to their hometowns at different times last year. At that time, they each paid transportation fees ranging from 30 to 40 yuan and held receipts. However, the coffins have not yet arrived in their hometowns. When they repeatedly inquired, they were given various excuses. When they inquired again recently, they were told that the ship had sunk and could not be transported back. When asked where the sinking occurred, why it sank, and whether there was any concrete evidence, they initially evaded the questions and then</p>
<p>avoided meeting. It is suspected that if the ship loaded by the defendant was due to the fault of the boatmen, the defendant should not only be responsible for negotiating but also for providing evidence. However, they remained silent, neither providing evidence nor handing over the boatmen. It is suspected that they set up a sham company, fraudulently collected transportation fees, dumped the corpses, repainted the old coffins, and resold them at high prices, hoping to take advantage of the lack of coffins in the interior during this time of national crisis.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that they are making this inhumane fortune. Moreover, the plaintiffs have confirmed this through investigation. The plaintiffs have entrusted the transportation of the remains of their ancestors, or the bones of their deceased husbands or wives. Now that the defendant has defrauded them of transportation fees and abandoned the remains, making it impossible to trace them, the means are vicious, and the intentions are sinister beyond measure. Therefore, they request the court to punish them according to Articles 339, 342, and 247 of the Criminal Law,</p>
<p>and order them to compensate each body for a loss of 1,500 yuan, etc. The court accepted the petition, and yesterday morning, judge Li Weishen presided over the second criminal court hearing. The defendant argued that the company had been established for more than ten years and had never had an accident. This time, it was indeed because of a sinking due to wind outside the Xuliujingkou of Hupu, and there is a certificate issued by the local guerrillas to prove it. The court reviewed the statements and found the evidence provided by the defendant insufficient, and immediately ordered the defendant to provide a written shop guarantee of 1,000 yuan for further inquiry at a later date.</p>

<p>Recently, the dog days have arrived, the weather is extremely hot, and epidemics are rampant. In recent weeks, the epidemic has suddenly become rampant. According to a reporter's inquiry at the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, since the hospital began providing treatment on the 20th of last month, those seeking medical attention have been endless. As of the 9th of this month, the total number has reached 8,688. Among them, dysentery, gastroenteritis, and cholera are the most rampant, with yesterday being the highest, reaching 652 people in a single day. There were 104 cases of gastroenteritis, 40 cases of dysentery, and 9 cases of true cholera have been discovered this year. Only one person is currently hospitalized, and the rest have recovered and been discharged.</p>
<p>Strict Inspection by the Japanese Side</p>
<p>Recently, cholera symptoms have suddenly become prevalent in the occupied areas of suburban Shanghai, with a rampant trend. Therefore, since yesterday, the Japanese army has been extremely strict in inspecting epidemic prevention certificates at various entry and exit points in western Shanghai. Anyone with a fake "certificate" will be detained and not allowed to pass. The Japanese side believes that there have been many cases of cholera recently, and the trend has a high probability of spreading further. Anyone without a recent epidemic prevention certificate will not be allowed to pass and will not be allowed to purchase tickets to take the train.</p>
<p>Alarming Number of Corpses on the Roadside</p>
<p>Since the surge in commodity prices in this city, it has been difficult for the general public to make a living, and beggars and vagrants who starve to death are also found every day, which is very tragic and appalling. Recently, as the dog days arrive, the number of deaths on the roadside has increased sharply. According to a Reuters reporter's inquiry at the Pushan Villa, the number of corpses found in the past week includes 239 adults and 2,800 children.</p>

<p>Yan Qiaoyun, a woman from Wuxi, is 30 years old this year. She has been a child bride in the family of Wang Yibao, a fellow villager, since she was a child. Ten years ago, she married Wang Yibao and had a child. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, Wang was drafted into the army in his hometown, causing Yan to have financial difficulties. She remarried to Xue Sanbao (28 years old), also a fellow villager, and has been married for more than two years. On the 6th of this month, Xue</p>
<p>came to Shanghai from Wuxi, and Yan also came with him. It was not until the day before yesterday that they found a place to stay in the second floor of No. 3 Tianhou Lane, No. 288 Yuezhou Road, and moved in together. There was a man named Pan Juquan (22 years old, also from Wuxi), who was originally in the sand casting business with Xue. He met Xue on the way, and Xue, knowing that he had no place to live, invited Pan to stay at his house temporarily. In the evening, the three of them</p>
<p>slept on the floor, with Xue in the middle, and Pan and Yan sleeping on either side. Around 10 o'clock, Yan was already asleep. Xue went out alone to cool off because the room was stuffy, and Yan was unaware of it. Soon, in her sleep, Yan felt someone pulling down her shorts, and there were no lights in the room, which was extremely dark. She thought it was her husband trying to consummate their marriage. Then, thinking that there was someone else next to the bed, she did not speak</p>
<p>and let it happen. While they were having intercourse, someone suddenly entered the room from downstairs. Hearing the voice, it was Xue Sanbao. Yan realized that the person having intercourse with her was not her husband but Pan Juquan. Seeing Xue suddenly arrive, Pan knew things were not good. He quickly found a pair of shorts to put on and ran away, but was stopped by Xue. They fought with fists and feet, causing Pan to suffer serious injuries to his face, lips, scrotum, and testicles. Pan</p>
<p>reported to the Huishan Concession Police after being beaten. Initially, he concealed the fact that he colluded with Yan and only said that he had been beaten. However, Chinese detective Qi Mengqing discovered that the shorts worn by Pan were women's clothing and knew there was a secret. After a detailed investigation, he discovered the incident of adultery and arrested everyone involved. Although Xue was inevitably angry at the time, he should not have beaten Pan,</p>
<p>and should have reported it to the police. Therefore, Xue was also detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin said that Pan could not attend court today due to injuries in the hospital. The police are now prosecuting Pan for rape and Xue for assault, requesting permission for a rescheduled hearing. After an interrogation by Judge Huang Risheng, Xue was ordered to remain in custody for a rescheduled hearing in one week.</p>

<p>Lai Yiren, the assistant manager of the Shanghai branch of the Nanjing Commercial Savings Bank, which recently closed due to financial difficulties, is a 41-year-old from Chaoyang, Guangdong. He currently resides at No. 13 Yunshang Village, Lane 22, Tasside Road, French Concession. In 1917, Lai married Huang Qiaolian (40 years old), a fellow villager, in Singapore, Southeast Asia, through a matchmaker. They have two sons and one daughter. Five years ago, Lai met Niu Jingyuan (27 years old this year, from Beijing), a female staff member of a certain agency in Beiping, and eventually took her as a concubine. After the National Army moved west, Lai changed his job to assistant manager of the Nank Bank Shanghai branch, bringing his wife and concubine to Shanghai, renting a residence at his current address. However, Lai was still not satisfied. Last spring, he met Fei Guiying (25 years old, from Pinghu), a student at Cambridge English College. They fell in love and eventually had a relationship. On August 28 of the same year, they held a formal wedding with Fei at the Grand Ballroom of the International Hotel, with the famous painter Liu Haisu as the witness. After the marriage, Fei was introduced by a friend to work as a female clerk at the Shihai Insurance Company, earning a monthly salary of 150 yuan. However, recently, Lai suddenly changed his behavior and often abused Fei. Fei recently became pregnant and gave birth to a daughter in the hospital on the 14th of last month. Lai treated them as strangers and ignored them. On the 7th of this month, Fei took her marriage certificate and reported it to the French Concession Police, who sent detectives to arrest Lai and bring him to the police station. After confirming the facts through interrogation, they jointly transferred him to the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court yesterday, filing a public prosecution for bigamy. After an interrogation by Judge Sun Pengxian, he ordered the defendant to temporarily be released on bail by his defense lawyer and ordered him to provide a substantial shop guarantee for a rescheduled hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Financial News: US Dollar Settlement of 600,000 Leads to a Sudden Advance in the Exchange Rate to the 6 Yuan Level <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices showed no fluctuations. In the black market for British and American exchange rates, the tight situation continued to intensify. Originally, due to a shift in public sentiment, foreign firms made large settlements. It is reported that settlements for rice, wheat, cotton, coal, tobacco, etc., reached over 600,000 US dollars, with foreign rice and cotton accounting for the majority. Chinese speculators also competed to buy (partially to cover short positions) 300,000 US dollars. Under the pressure of millions of US dollars, Chinese, British, and American banks could not supply enough, and the market showed a trend of tight conditions that were difficult to reverse. In the morning, the US exchange rate was most tightly quoted at 6 yuan. Later in the market, as foreign firms became more and more aggressive and Hong Kong telegrams also absorbed, the price broke into the 6 yuan level. US exchange rates of 5.9375 yuan were not lacking in transactions. The closing market was also brisk. British gold was at 3 pence 84375, and the US exchange rate was at 5.9375 yuan, a slight increase of 0.0625 yuan compared to the previous day's closing, while the US exchange rate decreased by 0.1875 yuan. The trend of futures was no different from the spot market.</p>
<p>Speculative Covering of 300,000 US Dollars</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, London large strips rose by 0.05, near-term rose by 0.1875, New York silver prices remained flat, London gold remained stable, and the British exchange rate against the US remained unchanged. The exchange rate against Shanghai was also flat, and there was no market for the exchange rate against France. The US exchange rate against the British was slightly up by 0.0375, and the exchange rate against Shanghai did not change, and there was no market for the exchange rate against France. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same as before. Banks opened the spot selling price in the morning, with British gold at 3 pence 9375 and the US exchange rate at 6.09375 yuan, an increase of 0.03125 yuan and a tightening of 0.0625 yuan compared to the previous day's closing, due to the decline in exchange rates. After opening, foreign firms first came to buy settlements for rice, wheat, tobacco, coal, and other settlements, and speculators also followed, and the market immediately softened. Foreign firms entered the US and British exchanges for the current US exchange rate at 6.065 yuan, and speculators entered the July US exchange rate at 6.03125 yuan. HSBC's listed price was announced as unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was announced to increase by 1.25%. After that, the buying trend remained strong. It is estimated that speculators purchased far-month US exchange rates up to 6 yuan, tightening to 5.90625 yuan. Later, the American bank reversed and bought the speculators' July US exchange rate at 6.0625 yuan. However, soon the current US exchange rate tightened to 6 yuan. A first order saw 3 pence 875, around 11 o'clock in the morning. Before the close, the market slightly rebounded, and there was a profit for the American bank that had absorbed the July US exchange rate at 6.03125 yuan, while the speculators bought the August US exchange rate from the Chinese bank Dongya, which tightened to 5.96875 yuan. The spot also retreated to 6.0625 yuan. As a result, British gold was at 3 pence 875, and the US exchange rate was at 6.03125 yuan, a decrease of 0.0625 yuan for British and American compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>The Tightening Trend Increased in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The situation was even tighter in the afternoon, as the needs of foreign firms increased and Hong Kong telegrams also came in. Initially, there was a profit for those who entered the speculators' US exchange rate for this month at 6.03125 yuan. Soon, the foreign firms bought the current US exchange rate for 6 yuan and 5.9375 yuan. Also, Hong Kong telegrams bought the US exchange rate for this month also at 5.9375 yuan. The closing market remained soft, with British gold at 3 pence 84375 and the US exchange rate at 5.9375 yuan.

<h3 id="e95">Amidst Heavy Buying, Gold Market Rapidly Rises <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold market (烚赤暗盤市况) continued its upward trend, a complete reversal from the sluggishness of the previous week. This was due to nervous short sellers rushing to cover their positions, while long position holders seized the opportunity to push prices higher, refusing to release their holdings. Furthermore, supplies from Tianjin were scarce, as it was rumored that gold bars being transported to Shanghai had been confiscated. Consequently, those Tianjin dealers who had previously sold short were unable to deliver, leading to intense pressure to cover, resulting in a significant shortage of available gold. Prices were repeatedly bid up, rising even faster than foreign exchange rates. The market opened with a jump of seventy yuan, reaching 5,320 yuan. Later, sales by gold shops temporarily pushed the price down to a low of 5,300 yuan. However, as foreign exchange rates weakened, prices surged again to 5,410 yuan. The midday close was 5,365 yuan, further boosting market sentiment. Demand was strong, and short sellers were willing to pay high prices to cover their positions, initially at 5,400 yuan. Although prices briefly dipped by a few tens of yuan, a wave of buying soon emerged, pushing prices to a peak of 5,495 yuan. The closing price was 5,490 yuan, a rise of 240 yuan compared to the previous day. Total trading volume for the day was over 3,000 taels. Gold jewelry also rose by twenty yuan, while customs gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>烚赤 Jumps by 240 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, the price per bar (ten taels) initially rose by seventy yuan due to shrinking exchange rates and tight US dollar rates, leading to strong market sentiment. Money exchange businesses brought twenty taels to gold shops, raising the price to 5,320 yuan. Subsequently, sales by gold shops caused a slight pullback. Securities firms released ten taels to gold shops, bringing the price down to 5,300 yuan. However, as foreign exchange rates remained tight and buying pressure persisted, both silver firms and gold shops competed to acquire gold, pushing the price up again by sixty yuan. Gold shops brought twenty taels to silver firms, setting the price at 5,360 yuan. Later, selling by money exchange businesses and gold shops caused a temporary dip of thirty yuan. Gold shops sold forty taels to silver firms, bringing the price to 5,330 yuan. Ultimately, due to continued weakness in the foreign exchange market, money exchange businesses frantically covered their short positions, and gold shops switched from selling to buying. With a temporary shortage of sellers, prices soon soared by eighty yuan. Money exchange businesses brought twenty taels to jewelry shops, raising the price to 5,410 yuan. At noon, foreign exchange rates eased, and leveraged long position holders sold to lock in profits, causing a temporary dip of forty-five yuan. Silver firms sold thirty taels to money exchange businesses, settling the midday closing price at 5,365 yuan. The market opened strong in the afternoon, jumping thirty-five yuan. Gold shops brought ten taels to silver firms, setting the price at 5,400 yuan. Subsequently, selling from those with upper-limit price orders hampered the upward momentum, and sales by gold shops and individual investors caused a temporary dip of thirty yuan. Silver firms traded twenty taels among themselves, setting the price at 5,370 yuan. Later, the foreign exchange market suddenly tightened, stimulating buying pressure. Gold shops stopped resisting and absorbed the selling pressure, while money exchange businesses were eager to cover their short positions, leading to a surge of 125 yuan under heavy buying pressure. Gold shops brought thirty taels to silver firms, setting the price at 5,495 yuan. Following that, gold shops brought another fifty taels to silver firms and others, setting the evening closing price at 5,490 yuan. As a result, the price rose 240 yuan compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 195 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of spot gold by current gold shops was several tens of yuan higher than 烚赤, while the buying price was thirty yuan lower. Spot gold was over fifty yuan lower than listed gold, with little activity.</p>
<p>Silver Jewelry Rises Two Levels</p>
<p>The exchange price of silver jewelry per tael initially remained at 540 yuan at Da Tong Heng. Around 9:45 AM, it rose ten yuan. After 3:00 PM, it rose another ten yuan. In total, Da Tong Heng changed the price to 560 yuan. The new Heng firm had similar upper prices. The buying price was about thirty yuan lower.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Foreign Currency Surges, Annam Piastres Alone are Weak <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign currency market 烚赤 surged due to the large-scale covering of short positions by Tianjin dealers, resulting in exceptionally high demand for British and American gold pounds. Market prices rose sharply across the board, by six yuan. While the British gold notes slightly retraced after the rise, they ultimately closed up by one dime. American gold notes were in high demand due to the strong buying by import banks in the black market for US dollars (美隴), causing market tightness. The evening market rose to 16.8 yuan, up eight dimes from the previous day. Hong Kong notes and Robbie, Canadian, and Philippine notes were also in demand, with prices rising across the board. Japanese gold notes were exceptionally sought after, with the evening market reaching 1.21 yuan. Korean notes maintained a balance between supply and demand, remaining at 9.85 dimes in the evening market. Annam piastres, on the other hand, had not been traded for a long time. Yesterday, there was some trading, but the price plummeted by nine dimes.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Sugar Market: Raw White Sugar Rebounds <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a tightening trend due to the shrinking foreign exchange rates. The association set the price for spot raw white sugar (二四粗白) from foreign warehouses at 68 yuan, which then rose to 68.2 to 68.3 yuan, a good increase of eight dimes. Re-exported sugar (轉口) was priced at 54 yuan for warehouse receipts and 54.6 yuan for delivery in twenty days, up eight to nine dimes. Taikoo granulated B mark sugar rose by half a yuan to 78.2 yuan. Dutch Red sugar was priced at 57.5 to 58 yuan, up five dimes. Domestic sugar remained stable with no transactions. Yesterday, 1,663 bags of sugar arrived from Haikou and 707 bags from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Grain: Over 70,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive in One Day, Rice Prices are Relatively Flat <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Large quantities of foreign rice flooded the market yesterday. Jardine Matheson's Yushun arrived from Haiphong with 7,376 bags, and 8,487 bags arrived from Hong Kong. The company's Desen also arrived from Hong Kong with 17,536 bags. Both ships arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, docking at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. Butterfield &amp; Swire's Yingzhou also arrived from Hong Kong with 17,180 bags, also arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, docking at the company's wharf in Pudong for unloading. The company's Jiangsu also arrived from Hong Kong with 10,879 bags, arriving at the port yesterday afternoon, docking at the company's wharf in Pudong for unloading. The Qiongzhou also arrived from Hong Kong with over 16,000 bags, arriving in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession. Unloading began last night. A total of five ships arrived yesterday, bringing a massive 77,458 bags of rice. Furthermore, Butterfield &amp; Swire's Chengdu, also carrying foreign rice, arrived in Shanghai yesterday evening. The exact quantity is unknown and will be reported later. (Zu)</p>
<p>Prices for high-quality foreign rice have already fallen by four to five yuan, while inferior grades have plummeted by as much as six to seven yuan. This has prompted domestic and rural dealers to take advantage of the low prices. Local shops have also increased their stocks. However, the market remained flat from morning to afternoon, holding steady at the original prices with little change. Rice futures, due to the large amount arriving, must be delivered. Many leveraged long position holders are struggling with cash flow and are forced to sell. However, re-export dealers have halted purchases due to incomplete export procedures, resulting in oversupply and weak market sentiment. As a result, prices have fallen sharply by over two yuan. Arnhold Trading's immediate delivery of Siamese No. 2 rice was priced at 70.05 to 70 yuan, No. 20 loading at 69.8 to 68.8 yuan, and No. 26 loading at 68.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Although the supply of glutinous rice is limited, with a lack of demand, prices continued to decline by one to two yuan. Jin Piaobai (金漂白) was priced at 66 to 67 yuan, Chang Danbai (常丹白) around 65 yuan, Jiangbei rice at 64 yuan, and Hong Kong rice at 66 to 67 yuan.</p>
<p>No domestic rice, such as thick and thin Japonica varieties, arrived yesterday. Rumors suggest that off-market trading remained weak. However, holders of goods, seeing the dwindling supply and stabilization of foreign rice, were unwilling to sell at lower prices, resulting in a relatively stable selling price, similar to before. Changbang Teqing Japonica still required 71 to 72 yuan, Changzhou Su Kun Japonica 70 yuan, second-grade Su 68 yuan, Qingsi thin rice 70 yuan, Nangang early rice 66 to 67 yuan, and Hu Jian 65.5 to 65 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Japanese Flour Dumping <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market remained quiet. China Flour Milling Company continued to sell only half of its supply from Fufeng, mostly purchased by noodle and cake makers, totaling about 3,000 bags. The factory price remained unchanged at 15.2 yuan. However, Japanese flours, such as Green Phoenix brand, were facing pressure from various domestic flours due to their darker color. Despite offering lower prices, they found little demand. Other brands like Jinshan Double Lion and Johnson's flour also saw prices ease by one to two dimes.</p>
<p>The wheat market continued to weaken yesterday, as prices were down and shipments from inland areas to Hongkou ranged from several thousand to 10,000 bags daily. However, most of it was purchased by Japanese factories, with Chinese factories taking only a small amount, as their purchasing prices were higher than those of the Japanese factories. This was due to the market conditions. The formal market still needs to develop.</p>

<p>Yarn Market: Continued its upward trend due to consistently good real transactions. Purchases from Hong Kong dealers remained strong, and there was also demand from Eastern Zhejiang. As a result, market sentiment was boosted, buying pressure revived, and speculation increased. 20-count Double Horse yarn broke through the 1,000 yuan mark, reaching as high as 1,034 yuan before slightly weakening. Compared to 800 yuan on June 28th, it has risen by over 200 yuan.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened strong, continuing the enthusiasm of the previous day, with buyers flocking to the market. It jumped over twenty yuan, with 20-count Double Horse priced at 990 yuan. However, buyers remained eager, briefly hesitating at the 1,000 yuan mark before surging to 1,034 yuan. At this point, gold prices were also high, and some profit-takers sold, causing a pullback to 1,005 yuan. The market then rebounded to 1,014 yuan at closing.

<p>Same Trade: 2,350; Hong Kong: 635; Inland: 30; Ningbo: 20; Xiamen: 20; Total: 3,075</p>
<h3 id="e101">Yarn Prices Rebound, Cotton Market Improves <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Spot cotton transactions continued to improve, but factory demand has not yet significantly increased. However, there was some buying among dealers to cover headwear business. At the same time, the rebound in yarn prices is also good for the cotton market. The spot cotton transaction details are listed below:</p>
<p>Tongzhou: 175.00, purchased by Qingxiang: 130 bales</p>
<p>Hui Si Deng: 199.00, 201.00, purchased by Qingsheng: 400 pieces</p>
<p>Pengjiapu: 210.00, purchased by Same Trade: 200 pieces</p>
<p>Huoji: 150.00, purchased by Same Trade: 200 bales</p>
<p>Taicang: 158.00, purchased by Same Trade: 200 bales</p>
<p>The market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, was initially very active yesterday. At the same time, adverse weather conditions in the eastern cotton regions and short covering resulted in closing prices rising more than ten points for both near and distant contracts. The Indian cotton market rose more than nine Robbie yesterday, including forecasts.</p>
<p>The trade in foreign cotton in Shanghai has been very brisk in recent days. Yesterday, due to the high price of yarn, market sentiment was exceptionally strong, and there were many inquiries from various parties. The available stock in the market is not abundant. Once the current stock is sold out, cotton transportation will be difficult. It is difficult to predict how high the future cotton market will rise. The transaction volume yesterday was considerable, approximately 3,000 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Securities: Beyond Reason, Rubber Shares Frequently Rise, British and Chinese and HSBC Pay Dividends <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The informal securities market remained stagnant yesterday, hovering between five dimes and one yuan, with mutual observation. Prices remained stagnant. In the morning, Jiufeng Lianyi bought, and Yichang Lianhe sold, and the market was flat. In the afternoon, Jiu Shuang Lianyi continued to buy, and Xinfu Hong and No. 25 both had demand. Lianhe continued to sell heavily. Hongda and No. 64 also sold. As a result, market prices were mixed between five dimes and one yuan. The transaction volume was estimated to not exceed 50 million yuan. A summary table is listed below:</p>
<p>In stock trading, 100 shares of Great China Match Company were traded at a price of 20.04 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market was extremely active and high-spirited. The surge in rubber shares became increasingly intense. The reason for this is difficult to ascertain. The main reason is the recent announcement of excellent dividends by British and Chinese and Kelo-Wah shares, leading to similar expectations for the future dividends of other companies. The tightening of the foreign exchange market is another factor contributing to the surge.</p>
<p>The industrial stock market was also very strong. At the close, there was still a rush of buyers for prominent shares.</p>
<p>The British-owned Hui Tong Yang Xing's two rubber companies, British Chinese and Kelo-Wah, are scheduled to pay interim dividends for 1940 on July 23rd. British Chinese will pay 3 yuan per share, and Kelo-Wah will pay 0.25 yuan per share. The British-owned Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) is scheduled to pay an interim dividend for 1940 on August 12th, at 2 pounds and 10 shillings in British gold per share.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Piece Goods: Japanese Merchants Take Advantage of High Prices to Offer 3,000 Pieces of Futures <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The cloth market first rose and then weakened. In the morning, due to the lingering momentum from the previous day, the tightening foreign exchange market, and hoarding, prices rose. Later, Dongpi offered a huge amount of futures at high prices, and sentiment gradually weakened. Peers then began selling, and prices immediately softened. As a result, white goods, fine cloth, twill, and part of coarse cloth rose by 0.25 to 1 yuan per piece. The quoted prices for bleached and dyed cloth remained flat. Dyeing factories in this street saw a sharp drop in interest due to the increased selling price of grey cloth. However, spot trading among individual hoarders was still busy. Merchants from the Zhejiang route, Wenzhou, Ningbo, and Taizhou continued to purchase. Total transactions included over 500 pieces of white goods and over 300 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth. On the 12th, 42 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Dongbu was very keen to see prices rise in this street, and the rising momentum was very strong. At the opening, Longtou fine cloth was priced at 29.45 yuan. It was then heard that the yarn market was rising, and the buying pressure was even stronger, jumping beyond the 30 yuan mark. The closing price at midday was 30.05 yuan. In the afternoon, off-market trading sold at a peak price of 31 yuan. However, the closing trend slightly retreated to 30.089 yuan. Sijunzi serge was priced at 0.915 yuan, because Dongmian Ito and other firms offered 3,000 pieces of next month's fine cloth, with Longtou priced at 31 to 31.5 yuan per piece. Medium-grade colored balls, Yanghe Wufu, and other brands were only priced at around 27.5 to 28 yuan in the morning market.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Cakes Plunge, Affecting Actual Soybeans <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, except for the Shengji soybean cakes (詳細市價欄), of which inland dealers purchased 3,000 pieces at low prices. The remaining transactions were mainly a settlement of prices based on the original basis, resulting in a slump in the market and strong selling pressure, falling by more than half a yuan compared to the previous day. As a result, the soybean market was affected, and no transactions were made for various soybeans used for oil extraction, mirroring the weakness of the soybean cake market. However, other soybeans suitable for export and local sales remained relatively stable due to the limited arrival and stock. It is estimated that 300 bags of Chongming sand yellow soybeans were purchased by Guangdong dealers at a price of 16.35 yuan, one cart of Nanjing soybeans was traded locally at a price of 26 yuan, and over 200 bags of Pudong Doudou soybeans were priced at 28.68 yuan. Today, 650 bags of soybeans and 300 cans of sesame oil will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Silk and Tea: Black Tea Exports Improve <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market saw a sudden shift in momentum. Exports of local black tea and De Zhuang saw a sudden improvement. The whole city was purchased by Xingcheng, Hausman, and other foreign firms for more than 480 cases, priced at 280 to 356 yuan. The reason for the current activity in the black tea market is that the export of Chinese tea from Hong Kong to Germany is extremely scarce. However, the green tea market remained sluggish. Only 40 cases of Zhucha were purchased by Yongyu and Baochang yesterday, priced at 310 yuan, with no other transactions.</p>

<p>Lily buds have recently seen a firm trend due to limited arrival and stock. High-quality goods, such as Ding Zhuang vegetables, have exceeded the 50 yuan mark and are now selling for 52 yuan, Da Xing vegetables for 48 yuan, Yang Hua for 46 yuan, Xiang Zhuang vegetables for 44 yuan, and ordinary second-grade Xuzhou vegetables for 32-33 yuan. It is heard that sporadic new Xuzhou vegetables are already available in the production areas and will soon arrive in Shanghai in small quantities.</p>

<p>Rope Performers</p>
<p>Rope performers, also known as corner performers, are all young women who can walk on the rope as if flying. They can also climb the rope high into the air, somersault, swing, and are as agile as monkeys. They are also skilled in jumping horses and climbing knives. They are rarely seen in the south, but there are still excellent performers among the women in the Beizhi Dongguang area. Last month, three rope performers were hired to perform for four days in Zhao Jia Chang, Hebei, Tianjin. The eldest was about thirty years old, one was seventeen or eighteen years old, and one was only a child. All had bound feet in the shape of a crescent moon. The youngest had the smallest double bends, the best beauty, and unique skills. They appeared on stage three times a day. At dawn, they raced horses, climbed knives in the middle of the day, walked the rope in the afternoon, and performed tricks on the knife mountain. The knife mountain is made of wood, in a cross shape, about five or six feet high. The top is tied with several chairs. The chair has a circle of hands placed flat, and the table is with feet up. The summit has an iron ring, like a wellhead, with several ends of the rope tied to the crossbeam, fluttering on the ground, and a bundle of silk a foot long hanging in mid-air. A horizontal wood is a triangle, which is for somersaults and swings. They appear on stage every day from dawn to sunset. The audience is noisy with carriages and horses, and the shoes are interlaced. Zhao Jia Chang is originally an open area, and there is almost no room to insert a foot. The horse race is counted for three weeks, with two women racing together. They are dressed in red for the elder, and black for the second, with short jackets and narrow sleeves, with various patterns.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Jesus is the Savior of the Poor <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Jesus especially preached the gospel to the poor, so most of those who believe in Jesus in the world are poor. However, poor people who believe in Jesus become rich everywhere. When Jesus was on earth, He Himself was poor all His life. He said, "Foxes have holes, and birds have nests, but the Son of Man (Jesus called Himself) has no place to lay His head." He taught people, "A man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions," and "Do not worry about your life... But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you." He also warned the rich, "Sell all that you have and give to the poor, and provide yourselves with moneybags that do not grow old, with a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."</p>
<p>Most rich people are selfish and greedy, so He said to the rich young man, "Go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and come, follow Me, and you will have eternal life." The rich should not be insatiable, selfish, but the poor should not be dependent, idle, but should work hard and support themselves, because "the Father also works constantly." It is a pity that the world is unwilling to accept Jesus, and does not know that Jesus is the Savior of the Poor. If everyone in the world earnestly does according to Jesus' principles, that is, the rich no longer selfish, abandoning greed, and having Jesus' love and sacrifice, voluntarily using their own property to help those in need, and those who live in hardship and the poor can struggle, work diligently, and be thrifty, eating because of work, not working because of eating; there will never be a labor-capital problem in the world, nor a class of rich and poor. Jesus' saving the poor is a truly radical method. Jesus is indeed the Savior of the Poor! The world often despises the poor, but Jesus respects them; He sees the poor as more valuable than the rich; if you believe in Jesus, He will surely save you, Paul said: "He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that you through His poverty might become rich."

<h3 id="e110">Money and Face <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Sanlang</p>
<p>Money and face are two things that, in principle, cannot coexist. Those who value "face" have to look down on "money," while those who love "money" must not be too particular about "face." Although this is the general understanding, in reality, some people are determined to uphold the principle of "I want money, but I also want face." Some might say, "That's good in theory, but I'm afraid it's impossible to achieve, right?" Or, "What is face anyway? How much does it cost per pound?"</p>
<p>Yes! What is face?</p>
<p>A school principal said:</p>
<p>"...We invited a certain celebrity to be a school board member, hoping he would donate some money to the school. But he didn't donate. Even if he didn't donate, he sent his children to study at the school. Even if they study, he's not willing to pay tuition. What does that mean? When I discussed it with him, he said, 'Children of people with face don't pay tuition. Paying a little money is a small matter, but face is important, and I can't lose it!'..."</p>
<p>Oh! So that's what face is!</p>
<p>Recently, there was a famine in the Ningbo area, and many people couldn't endure the hunger and died. Those who have already died are gone, but those who haven't died yet need everyone to discuss a solution. So they held meetings, elected committees, sent telegrams, raised donations, investigated the households of the poor, and sent people abroad to purchase grain... they worked diligently. Amen! After a few months, they finally dragged a large group of refugees out of the realm of the dead. They took out forty cents, which could be exchanged for one liter of black and broken rice. Black rice or broken rice, forty cents a liter, is cheap after all.</p>
<p>One day, a refugee was talking on the street. Person A said:</p>
<p>"Forty cents for a liter of rice is really unaffordable. I heard that in a few days, you won't even be able to buy a liter of rice for forty cents."</p>
<p>"Yes!" Person B said, "As soon as you hear that the county is selling rice at a low price, who wouldn't want to get some cheap goods? A few days ago, Amao told me that his master—that gentleman who works in some government office—got a total of ten piculs of rice, costing only nineteen yuan per picul. The rice is of good quality and the grains are large."</p>
<p>"Isn't Amao's master very rich? How is he qualified to buy low-priced rice?"</p>
<p>"Face! The most important thing in life is face. He knows people in the association. If he says ten piculs, then it's ten piculs."</p>
<p>Oh! So that's what face is!</p>
<h3 id="e111">A Trivial Matter <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Lingyou</p>
<p>In a crowded trolleybus, I suddenly heard the sound of a passenger arguing with the ticket seller. Listening carefully, the reason for the argument was extremely simple and a very small matter. However, because neither side would give in, the tone of the argument increased with the movement of the wheels.</p>
<p>The passenger took out a one-yuan bill to buy two ten-cent tickets from the ticket seller. The ticket seller gave the passenger two tickets and eight cents in change, and that should have been the end of it. However, because four cents of the eight cents in change were five-cent bills, the passenger insisted that the ticket seller give fewer five-cent bills. The ticket seller refused and loudly said, "These five-cent bills are not unusable. They are bills from the Central Bank. They are not trolleybus vouchers. If they were new, you might try to snatch them." As a result, you cursed me, and I cursed you. The passenger's verbal persuasion was useless. If the argument continued, a fight would be unavoidable. In the tense atmosphere, a middle-aged passenger sitting next to me suddenly took out two twenty-cent bills from his pocket and exchanged them with the ticket seller for the four cents in five-cent bills, instructing the ticket seller to give the two twenty-cent bills to the passenger who refused to take the five-cent bills. The ticket seller angrily gave the eight cents to that passenger, and the tense argument finally stopped.</p>
<p>Although this is a trivial matter, I feel it has value for readers.</p>

<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Conflicting Information</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou said, "Lao Mao, go on. Tell us what you saw. What did you see?"</p>
<p>Lao Mao said, "I saw that fellow surnamed Yu."</p>
<p>"When did you see him?"</p>
<p>"Just now—a minute or two ago."</p>
<p>Ni Jintao made a strange noise, saying, "A minute or two ago?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I saw it with my own eyes."</p>
<p>Huo Sang seemed to understand Lao Mao's meaning better than Ni Jinshou. He continued, "Did you see him at the gate just now?"</p>
<p>Lao Mao's gaze shifted to Huo Sang's face, and he nodded, "Yes, this detective told me to wait in the gatehouse and not come out. I was very bored, so I opened the window and looked outside. I suddenly saw Young Master Yu coming from the direction of Datong Road. First, he looked at the hearse parked there, then he looked at the iron gate, but he didn't come in. He looked a bit sneaky. Just then, Miss Wang's body happened to be carried out of the gate. His actions were even more suspicious."</p>
<p>"How so? What actions?"</p>
<p>"He walked to the side of the stretcher, lifted the white sheet, and looked at Miss Wang's face. After he looked, before the police officer behind could even get out of the gate, he ran away as if he were flying."</p>
<p>Huo Sang paused, as if in thought, and did not answer immediately. Ni Jinshou quickly continued. He said to Lao Mao, "You took it upon yourself to run in here to report, is that all?"</p>
<p>Lao Mao licked his lips and replied, "Sir, I thought he looked very suspicious."</p>
<p>"Suspicious? Just because he looked suspicious, you're saying he's the murderer?"</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou's tone showed a great deal of disappointment. In fact, his earlier excitement had been excessive. Huo Sang still tried to mediate gently.</p>
<p>He said, "Jinshou, don't be impatient. Sit down. Lao Mao has more to say."</p>
<p>Lao Mao nodded and said, "Sir, yes, he came last night too, I saw him." (42)</p>
<h3 id="e114">Shanghai Summer Children's Camp <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— A Participant</p>
<p>In this chaotic era, the public is struggling through extreme hardship, and the devastation suffered by children is even more unimaginable. Look at the situation on this isolated island. The streets and alleys are full of children running around and shouting. In the summer, it is even more heartbreaking to see. All day long, they crawl on the ground playing marbles or making squares out of cigarette boxes, shouting dirty words, their bodies as dirty as piglets, their lives clearly in decline. Parents can only sigh when they see this, because they are forced by life to live in cramped apartments like pigeon cages, and they barely have enough to eat to avoid starvation. They usually don't have the ability to afford education, let alone now in the summer. If they were to confine their children to their small, oven-like rooms, wouldn't they be steamed into meat buns? The target of the summer children's camp is these poor, out-of-school street children.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a place where every inch of land is worth its weight in gold, and the summer children's camp also lacks venues to operate. Because regular schools hold summer classes in the morning, the only possible time to hold the summer children's camp is to change it from the morning to the afternoon. In this way, due to the climate, the workload of the staff will be increased significantly. The activities of the summer children's camp usually include gatherings, talks, stories, literacy, singing, general knowledge, current events, hygiene inspections, and handicrafts. Although the daily program is not heavy, by creating a loving fellowship with the children, it can naturally implement the essence of teaching. After five or six weeks of training, the children can feel a deep and lively impression.</p>
<p>On July 1st, all the staff of the Shanghai Summer Children's Camp held a discussion meeting at Qingxin Girls' High School on Jing'an Temple Road. The meeting place was filled with an inspiring and moving atmosphere. Ms. Ling Wu Fuyin, the general secretary of the Women's Department of the Baptist Church, gave a speech on the importance and methods of street children's education.</p>
<p>According to reports, last year there were twenty-six summer children's camps in Shanghai, with a total of 279 staff members and 3,529 children. The Shanghai program is part of the national summer children's camp. Last year, there were a total of 704 summer children's camps nationwide, with 2,558 staff members and 26,655 children. This year, there are about thirty summer children's camps in Shanghai. The confirmed locations are: Lao Beimen Baptist Church, Moore Church on Yuqiaqing Road, Shanghai East Middle School at the Times Building on Simalu Road, Zhenguang School at 108 Daxilu Road, St. Book Institute at 38 Jisi Feier Road, Methodist Church at 758 Maigen Road, Zhuen Church at Lianjili on Jing'an Temple Road, Guangdong Baptist Church at 66 Avenue Edward VII, All Saints Church on Lafayette Road, Fahua Huaiben Church, Qingxin Girls' High School at 591 Lane Jing'an Temple Road, Tian'an Church on Shandong Road, YMCA Middle School on Sichuan Road, Huadong United Middle School at the Kenye Building on Jiangxi Road, Hujiang University at Continental Shopping Mall, Puyi Society in Nanshi, Qingxin Church at Dananmen, Xiude Elementary School at Avenue Edward VII and Carter Road, and McLaren Middle School on Wuding Road. Other locations are being actively planned.</p>
<p>The association advocates contributing practically to street children in a calm manner. Do not make extensive publicity, but I have heard that some still cannot find a venue, some still do not have the funds to buy books (about forty cents per child), and some may not have even started. Hoping that more people will assist in this service work, I have made this brief report. Well, if you can save the cost of an ice cream, you can donate a street child's books. If you can lend a venue or provide other material or human assistance, you can help promote this work. The association's office is located at the Christian Association Building, 169 Yuanmingyuan Road, 3rd Floor. I sincerely hope that readers will give it a warm response.</p>

<p>B: We originally implemented saving "daylight," not saving "electric light." This result is already unexpected!</p>

<h3 id="e116">Chaplin Issues Statement — "The Great Dictator" Scheduled for September Release — <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Huazhi</p>
<p>After Germany's great victory in Europe, it has a predatory attitude towards the United States. The general isolationist faction in the United States has therefore raised its head again, advocating not interfering in foreign affairs. As a result, some anti-German films currently being filmed in Hollywood are in danger of being forced to stop production. The total loss could reach six million U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>The first to be affected among these films is the comedy "The Great Dictator," personally produced by Charlie Chaplin, which has been hyped for two years. The production cost is 1.5 million U.S. dollars, funded entirely by Chaplin. The second is MGM's "Escape," costing 1.25 million U.S. dollars, and "Dead Tide," costing 900,000 U.S. dollars. Twentieth Century Fox's "Four Sons," "I Married a Nazi," and "Tyrant" total 2.3 million U.S. dollars. Also, Paramount's "Mysterious Pirate," worth 350,000 U.S. dollars, is on the list of films to be stopped.</p>
<p>According to reports, Chaplin is currently sailing a yacht in the Pacific Ocean. Upon hearing this news, he became somewhat anxious and quickly issued a statement through his agent, United Artists, to refute the rumors, saying in essence: "The rumor that I have abandoned 'The Great Dictator' is completely unfounded. The film is currently being edited and will be released as soon as it is completed. At this time, laughter is the only thing that matters to the world, for a good laugh is a priceless treasure for our health."</p>
<p>According to recent reliable sources, "The Great Dictator" will be released in September, as insisted by Chaplin.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Carlton to Perform Charity Show — Zhou Xinfang and Zhang Yipeng Collaborate on Performance — <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Lengbai</p>
<p>The Carlton Theater is currently in its summer break. However, in order to help the Shaoxing refugees, three charity shows will be held in the next few days, performed over two days.</p>
<p>In addition to the full participation of small newspaper opera enthusiasts, Zhou Xinfang, Zhang Yipeng, Huang Guichun, Wang Xichun, and others will all work together. Worth reporting are three good plays: "Full Son-in-law All," "Song Shi Hui," and "Eight Great Hammers."</p>
<p>In "Full Son-in-law All," Zhou Xinfang will play Zidu, Zhang Yipeng will play Ying Kaoshu, and in addition to "Raising the Flag and Pulling the Cart," it will also include Huang Guichun's "Filial Piety Moves Heaven," which can be said to be a rare grand event in the opera world in recent years. In "Song Shi Hui," in addition to Zhou Xinfang, Gao Baisui, Wang Xichun, and Jin Suwen performing, it will also include Wang Lanfang and Liu Binkun's "Live Capture," which is also a great event. As for "Eight Great Hammers," I remember that Xinfang and Yipeng collaborated on the performance at the Gong Stage last year, which was highly praised. Now it is decided to perform it again, and it is certainly expected to be a sensation.</p>
<p>It is said that the ticket price will be sold for five yuan. With such a lineup and strong repertoire, and especially since it is for helping refugees, it is naturally not considered expensive. At the same time, the front desk will also open the air conditioning free of charge, which is truly an unexpected happiness for the audience.</p>

<p>(1) Warner's No-Smoking Sound Stage</p>
<p>Due to tradition, smoking is not allowed on Warner Brothers' Stage 21. No matter the director, cinematographer, actors, or other staff, everyone is prohibited. Everyone who works at Warner's knows this, but other sound stages besides Stage 21 are not the same, and smoking is not prohibited.</p>
<p>(2) Chaplin Selects and Gives Beauty Products</p>
<p>Although Charlie Chaplin and his angel Paulette Goddard did not live together long before they had disagreements and divorced, they still maintain a considerable friendship to this day. Recently, Paulette Goddard is filming a new film, The Ghost Breaker, at Paramount Pictures, and Chaplin sends twelve kinds of beauty products to Miss Goddard's dressing room every day. It can be seen that they are still connected and have not forgotten their old love!</p>
<p>(3) Colbert's Strong Interest in Ice Skating</p>
<p>Claudette Colbert has been very interested in ice skating recently. One day, in order to go ice skating in Yosemite, she drove all night and skated all day from morning to evening.</p>
<p>(4) Chuck McGhee as Temporary Shepherd</p>
<p>Several Hollywood actors have purchased farmland and opened pastures. Like Chuck McGhee, after recently finishing filming, he returned to his ranch in Paso Robles during his vacation to work as a temporary shepherd and felt very happy.</p>
<p>(5) Sky Shots Are Becoming Safer</p>
<p>Since aerial photography became popular, Hollywood film companies have often shot sky shots. In the early years, because airplanes were not as safe as they are now, there were quite a few actors who died in plane crashes while filming aerial footage. But now, we rarely hear of such incidents. It can be seen that air travel is much safer than before!</p>
<p>(6) Actresses Like to Marry Great Men</p>
<p>Every woman in the world most likes to be the wife of a great man, and movie actresses are no exception. Sometimes, even when they play the wife of a great man on screen, they forget everything and act as if they really are the wife of a great man, appearing very arrogant to others.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Old Capital Opera Troupe Survey (Part 1) — A Total of 45 Troupes and 5 Training Schools <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Plum Blossom Hall Owner</p>
<p>The organization of opera troupes in the old capital is different from that in Shanghai. Most troupes are formed by individual performers with star power (also known as starting a troupe). A person familiar with the opera business is entrusted to take charge. This person is called the troupe leader (commonly called the "head") or manager. All matters such as hiring performers, assigning plays, rehearsing, selling tickets, registering, and contacting theaters or the outside world are the responsibility of the manager. In recent years, managers have been renamed presidents. This president is also what the proverb calls the "front-facing boss." According to a recent survey, there are a total of 45 opera troupes in Beijing, including 5 training schools. The rest are troupes formed by individual performers. The "troupe name," "president," and "performers" of each troupe are listed separately below:</p>
<p>(1) Training Schools</p>
<p>Fu Liancheng Troupe President: Ye Longzhang All performers are male</p>
<p>Opera School President: Jin Zhaoyan Coed</p>
<p>Rongchun Troupe President: Zhao Yankui Coed</p>
<p>Kuide Troupe President: Unknown All members are female</p>
<p>Rongqing Troupe President: Unknown This troupe specializes in Kunqu opera</p>
<p>(2) Male Performers</p>
<p>Chongqing Troupe President: Shang Fuxia Troupe Head: Shang Xiaoyun</p>

<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>Slight Comments After Listening to Tan Fuying and Other Performers</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Gengxin Stage this spring, there have been rumors that Tan Fuying's troupe has been invited to perform in the south. From spring to summer, people have been eagerly waiting. Now, in the heat of summer, they have finally arrived. Anyone with a passion for old operas will want to be among the first to see them. Fuying and others started performing on July 2nd. The main performance on the first day was "Empty City Stratagem and Beheading Ma Su." My friend Mr. Zhang bought tickets in advance, and I went with him. I saw Yang Shengchun's "Picking the Imperial Carriage" and Chen Lifang's "Female Escort." I left after listening to Tan Fuying's "Beheading Ma Su." On the fourth day, Tan posted "Catching and Releasing Cao Cao with Public Court." My friend Mr. Li also reserved seats for me, and I went. I saw Yang Shengchun playing Luo Sihui. Chen Lifang, Jiang Miaoxiang, and Ji Yanfen jointly performed "Second Volume of Rainbow Pass." Tan Fuying, Wang Quankui, Ci Ruiquan, and Ha Baoshan jointly performed "Catching and Releasing Cao Cao," from passing the border to finishing at the inn. Now, I will briefly record what I heard and saw in the two performances.</p>
<p>Yang Shengchun: On the first day, "Picking the Imperial Carriage" is a major performance in long-armed armor. The fighting is heavy, and he must sing northern tunes. Even a slightly admirable performance is considered a skilled performer. He is still young, and his skill is not yet fully developed. Wearing long-armed armor, his height does not seem sufficient. On the fourth day, he played Huang Tianba in "Catching Luo Sihui." The short-armed fight was more dashing and stylish, and he added new-style tricks to his movements. Shengchun and Gao Shenglin are both northern-style young martial artist talents. He should start with a grand style to succeed the orthodox style of Xiaolou.</p>
<p>Chen Lifang: I heard that Lifang is the son of the old actor Chen Fusheng. He once studied under Cheng Yanqiu, specializing in learning Cheng Yanqiu's singing and acting, and is quite similar. In the past, Yanqiu was good at emitting high, thin tones, which others called ghost tones. Lifang has this ability. Before the "Western Slope" and "Daoban," he used a high and thin tone, and at the end, he turned it higher and louder. With this one skill alone, it can be seen that he has real ability and is good at using his breath. In the following sections, he sang well, with excellent breath control. His use of clappers and filler words is also very clever. His acting imitates Yanqiu's style too much. However, he occasionally fails to hit the correct pitch in one or two places when singing, which should be improved. Then it will not be difficult for him to become very popular. The "Second Volume of Rainbow Pass" on the fourth day is a short play, so I will not discuss it.</p>
<p>Tan Fuying: On the first day, his "Losing Jieting and Beheading Ma Su" double introduction was better than others, but not yet exquisite. His spoken tone was slightly lower than his singing tone, perhaps due to a lack of energy. He was deliberately saving his energy for later. The "Two Countries" section was close to the singing style of Yu Shuyan. The "Mountain" character in "Near the Mountain and Water," I heard him sing this character most broadly and solidly last year, but this time it was slightly worse. The last four lines of the third report, "Hoping that the First Emperor will show his power in the sky," are the most difficult to sing. Fuying can raise and stabilize the high note in the "show" character. This sentence is definitely not in Yu's style, but in Tan's local style. Although the rhythm of the "power" and "spirit" characters was not fully in tune, it is still commendable.</p>
