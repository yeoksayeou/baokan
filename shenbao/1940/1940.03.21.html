<p>社評</p>
<h3>和平之詮釋</h3>
<p>負國家重任者，和平時代決不輕言戰爭，戰爭時期決不輕言和平；即在戰時醞釀和平，亦必待和平確有把握之日，始不諱言和平；誠以政策不容輕事轉變。士氣民心不容輕率張弛，國族禍福利害不容輕付嘗試；蓋政治家態度應若此，責任應若此；亦必若此，始克稱政治家，克負國家重任也。是在中國歷史，每値用兵域外，或禦侮邊疆，大計決於廟堂，而廷臣和戰之議輒囂然並存：則因『民可使由之，不可使知之』，朝野隔閡，內外梗阻，是時代病態，不足為今日訓。今日蔣委員長之再三昭吿國民，謂必忍艱苦，抗戰以迄最後勝利；堅決强毅，舉國翕然，此實中國歷史所創見，顧現代各國政家何莫不然。徵之近例：英國首相張伯倫氏前日在彼下議院演說時，聲明英國奮起作戰，務獲理想之和平目的，不達目的，必奮鬭不已；德國官方昨日否認和平攻勢之說，謂德國去年提議和平既被拒絕，今後對於和平，決不再有所發動；英德兩方並各以「戰至獲勝為止」為口號；堅決强毅，蓋與中國蔣委員長不謀而合，如出一轍。此無他，現代政治家應若此，必若此耳。</p>
<p>中日兩國血戰將滿三年，迄今絕無息戰媾和之朕兆；雖汪精衛號召和平，獲得日本近衛，平沼，阿部，米內諸內閣之支撑，以建「府」掌「政」之姿態，有所舉措於淪陷區域之內，然日本仍公開承認並不能因此結束所謂「中國事變」，且仍竭力摒擋其空前龐大之戰時預算；具見日本尙未修正其侵略政策，放棄其侵略軍事，亦見中國之非繼續抗戰不可；此乃無待評騭，不分贊否之客觀事實，亦不可掩飾之彰明趨勢也。至於歐戰，本報昨既推論之為在醞釀排解之中，並略舉蛛絲馬跡，說明其有及早息戰之可能；於此醞釀尙未揭曉之日，當然不能斷言醞釀之成敗；然英德兩國當局所表示之決心，所倡導之口號，亦不足以反證醞釀之無成。失敗之揭曉，或可見之於今後交戰國雙方或任何一方所作强化戰時氣息之新行動，或可聞之於美國國務副卿威爾斯氏返美後，美總統羅斯福氏或國務卿赫爾氏之長歎一聲。成功之揭曉，至早亦待威爾斯氏之報命。</p>
<p>至於目前，最可樂觀者，莫若和平涵義之大體漸見確定。善哉羅斯福氏於五日前向全世界廣播曰：「吾人今日應尋求以道德為基礎之和平，若四海不能成為兄弟，則無眞正之和平；若和平之成果為壓迫饑餓殘酷，或武器勝於人道，則不獲持久之和平；若小國時在强國威脅之下生活，則無穩固之和平；若自由為侵略所剝奪，則無道義之和平；若人類之意志思想被抑制，則無合理之和平；若上帝被否認，則無正直之和平；自上次歐戰之終結至今日之歐戰，世界尙未有以此為基礎之和平」；故「世界正在尋求眞正和平，務足以保證小國之主權及宗敎文化之自由」云。吾人贊成羅斯福氏對於和平之詮釋，且擁護之以促其實現；於是而想像威爾斯氏歷聘歐洲諸强，昨既首途，滿載而歸，姑不問充溢其囊槖者，固為何如內容，然醞釀成功之揭曉，斷乎不離羅斯福氏詮釋之輪廓，則可確實信任而不疑者也。</p>
<p>羅斯福氏廣播其和平見解之後，各方稱頌之反應，具見近日中外報章，其間最可注意者：羅氏廣播之後兩日，義國首相墨索里尼氏與德國元首希特勒氏，始長談於勃倫納山隘；長談之後，對於羅氏所痛切申述者，迄今未聞作何異議。羅氏廣播之後三日，英相張伯倫氏在彼下院演說，坦白接受羅氏之和平詮釋，並表明英國奮戰以求者，若此詮釋之和平而已。竊以為和平涵義既見確定，在理論上可以評判凡百和戰論之正謬，在政策上可以分析國際和平與反和平之分野，在事實上則信念所宗範疇所在，可以醞釀共趨於眞正和平之運動。竊以為威爾斯氏必不徒勞往返，羅斯福氏必不徒費脣舌，而美國國民亦必不辜負其國族之雄偉力量，坐視善惡之消長，而徒言和平眞理！</p>

<p>紐約　美財長毛根韜向參院銀行貨幣委員會發言、反對停購外國白銀之湯森德議案、謂觀於美國建立對外貿易與外交關係之努力、則提建中之停購外國白銀事、應視為委員會所硏究的銀行與貨幣一般問題之一部分加以硏究、而不應單獨硏究之云、委員會已允於今日投票表決此建議、擁護該案者稱、可得充分贊成票、使該案提交參院討論云（二十日路透電）</p>

<p>培利夏氏質問援芬舉措失當</p>
<p>前陸相培利夏問協約國在其扼要的外交中與總努力之中、是否盡其所能、以期達其目的、並謂戰爭開始時有迅雷不及掩耳之兩次打擊、一爲波蘭之被消滅、一爲海上德國商業之被掃除、自此而後、德國在陸地無甚活動，而協約國則專力於封鎖、此爲協約國所採打敗德方之唯一有效利器、然此於事已足乎、抑須在其他方面加强壓力乎、德國亟需鐵砂與鋼之接濟、德國之所以促成芬蘭戰事之結束者、其故在此、蓋蘇聯對芬一日不停戰、則德國所可取給於蘇聯之物質上利益、一日不能實現、其尤甚者、厥爲礦油、芬蘭事即協約國　、爲協的國計、協約國當維持芬蘭之抗戰、就最高軍事會議察之、派兵援芬事屬可行、且亦需要、惟從此時起、協約國之行動、應出以毅然決然之手腕、在制定政策時固不妨觀望猶豫、但在實施政策時、則不應如此、就事實所示、協約國竟使其所擬有之策動地位、爲他人所攫得、誠不幸也、人人皆知兵力需要之迫切、最高軍事會議、有此決定後、巳三星期、協約國直至芬蘭政府已與莫斯科接洽之時、始吿以軍隊與　械之出發、俟芬蘭一再請願時爲之、挪威外相不實謂蘇芬和平談判業已進行，協的國方向挪威作假道出兵之請求乎、一般　情　以爲空軍大肆威力、定可擊破蘇軍攻擊、他方縱有反對、然不能阻止英空軍大隊之出發、英國豈不以保全時局値得英國飛機廠一個月之出產乎、詎英法猶豫、敵方活潑、而芬蘭遂喪失矣、今日歐洲各處影響顯明、今有趨向新陣綫之動作、戰事或無發展、但希特勒之黨羽、現方奔走甚忙、試問協約國能否阻止中立國與德國聯終之趨勢乎、整個戰爭必須以整個努力制勝、德蘇盟約、前曾損及義日兩國對德之同情、今德國顯然用多大努力欲恢復其友誼、如此種理論、終又成不利民治國之工具、則誠爲不幸發展、英法爲世界最强之國、如欲實踐其主義、以達於勝利、則必不可徒具强盛之名、但必表示其强盛之力、</p>
<p>辛克萊氏主張抓住先發地位</p>
<p>倍利夏發言旣畢、自由黨領袖辛克萊繼起致詞、謂協約國宜竭力奮勵以博取勝利、必須抓住先發地位而緊握之、國會不妨考慮是否欲得較諸日前所有者更有效力之國家的帝國的與協約國間的戰爭工具、今之戰時內閣、以其對自治領與協約國間會商之現有方法、分配不勻、運用不靈、似未能增進認眞作戰之精神、自渠觀之、國會宜開秘密會討論此事、今欲保全波蘭與芬蘭、固嫌太晚、然吾人應透澈處理此種事件、免使吾人主義再遭頓挫、首相所發關於斯加巴灣新近會戰之言論、渠亦贊同、今戰事之進行不若前所預料、沉寂已甚、故任何地方砲聲一響、民眾輒易視爲大事、英國現與甚有力量與效能之一國交戰、而歐洲將否復入於野蠻與惡覇的政府之時代、抑將光大其以自由公道與法治爲基礎之光明、實繫於此、波蘭芬蘭波羅的海興斯堪的那維亞亞半島諸國之自由與獨立、悉唯協約國對德戰爭之勝利是賴</p>
<p>阿特里氏質問政府行動遲緩</p>
<p>工黨領袖阿特里亦起立發言、謂芬蘭反對侵略之勇武抗戰、與央國奪鬭以求者同一志趣、援芬責任不獨英國負之、凡國聯會員國無一不負之、挪威與瑞典於此、未具有强盛軍備、渠不欲聞對於與戰綫接近之人民、有不近情理之判斷、英國所可給予之援助範圍、視英國能與瑞典挪威合作之程度而定、凡侵犯瑞挪權利之舉動、當然必無其事、工黨不便謂英政府本可安全給予更多之援助、但願知已給予者是否及時而無非必要之延緩、渠更希望英國襄助芬蘭復與之努力可爲他國之模範、渠敢問英國是否刻在外交軍事與經濟各方面竭其所能、首相所稱協約國從芬蘭學得之敎訓、爲如欲擊敗侵略則必須團結一致一語、渠極贊同、渠希望國人準備反抗希待勒所將給予之任何打擊、惟靜坐以待打擊之政策、實爲取死之道、吾人必不可許希特勒取得發動地位、協約國必須以可能的最善方法用其物力與人力云、</p>
<p>阿特里言及國內煤業狀况、謂戰時失業之礦工、現仍過多、運輸制度多所浪費宜改善鐵路公路運河與海上運輸制度而利用之、在此種事業上、宜予以更多之注意、而收人力之更大利用、國會須知國內現尙有失業者一百四十萬人、</p>
<p>張伯倫對各議員質問之答辯</p>
<p>工黨議員達爾頓亦起立發表意見、首相張伯倫對此辯論發言答復謂、達爾頓以政府未充分維持國人戰志爲慮、要知英國智力、處處不及敵方、英國雖對德封鎖、然有漏隙接濟品仍源源運入德國之說、並非眞相、且非鼓起致勝勇氣之道、達爾頓未知英國工作之範圍、不解漏隙對全部工作之甚少比例、在目前之戰爭中、如欲從戰事開始時成立完備之封鎖、殆爲不可能、英國一面欲以與其戰爭旨趣不相矛盾之方式優容中立國、一面辦理封鎖事宜、其所感困難、已可概見、達爾頓似謂、如破壞中立國權利、而能加創敵方、則中立國權利不應顧及、要知英國不抱此見解、英國勉力不越出國際公法之規程、而德國則反是、巳絕對的取消訴諸國際公法反對任何破壞之權利、英國有時於就近對敵交綏而勢將碍及中立國權利之際、亦爲顧及英國自己時常援用之國際公法條例、至於達爾頓所稱挪威聽令德艦破壞其中立一節、則英國海軍與空軍時常監視德艦有無侵犯挪威領海之舉動、如果證實其有此情事、則吾人將不得不入此領海而追擊之云、（衆歡呼、）</p>

<h3>金融　美英滙兌　看縮心理仍未减</h3>
<p>外匯昨日巿况、滙豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美匯暗市、情况依然乏勁、足以左右巿面之消息、惟有待歐洲之戰事局勢澄淸、昨曾預測美英匯兌有復跌之可能、及匯巿之走軟、果於今日晨初報跌二分三七五、是以開後美較英為緊、嗣雖日行及港電等吐塞、中途回硬、但不久外電突傳英首相對歐洲和平之信心、甚形淡薄、作戰到底政策、未遭變更、致華商紛扒期貨美匯、毫不猶疑、結果英美匯均示微緊、而人心對於匯兌看縮心理、繼續未移也、</p>
<p>美滙買風未衰</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠期均平、紐約銀價亦平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美滬法各匯均平、美對英縮二分三七五、對滬未更對法小一分一二五、中央掛牌各匯如舊·銀行晨開現貨　價、英金四辦士一二五、美匯六元四三七五、較之前收、美比英為緊、計英縮零一五六二五、美軟零六二五、乃匯兌復跌之故、開後日行首來稍吐、接踪港電亦有賣出、巿勢驟見回硬、計日行售予有利現貨美匯六元四六八七五、及港電賣予外行現貨英金四辦士四零六二五、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭　亦無升降、此後華商因聞電傳英首相張伯倫態度强硬、宣言決不中途言和、作戰到底、故大衆對於美英匯兌續看小面、又來扒進期貨美匯、致巿面重形趨緊、計投機商結入大通某行等本月份美匯六元四零六二五、及下月份美匯六元三一二五及二八一二五、同時某行又吐予同行本月份美匯亦為六元四零六二五、斯時現貨美匯亦復緊達六元四三七五、現貨英金亦重縮至四辦士一二五、嗣後扒者轉少、為狀漸定、午刻華行上海塞予外行下月份美匯六元二八一二五、缺乏影響、延至收盤、英余四辦士一二五、美匯六元四三七五、本月份英金四辦士一零九三七五、美匯六元四零六二五、下月份英金四辦士零四六八七五、美匯六元二八一二五、結果比上日現期英緊零一五六二五、美軟零六二五、午後週三無巿、</p>
<p>香港英平美緊</p>
<p>香港二十日（週三）電、今晨匯市開盤平穩、英匯現期貨均無上落、美匯現貨緊零六二五、為二十三元一八七五、遠期縮一二五、為二十三元、申匯現貨升五角、為三百五十八元、日匯現貨緊五角、為九十八圓五角、十時仍吿平穩、美匯現貨續緊零六二五、為二十三元一二五、遠期仍站廿三元原盤、十一時三十分吿平、各滙概無變動、下午週三無市、</p>
<p>天津英美均長</p>
<p>天津二十日（週三）電、今晨匯市開盤穩定、英匯現貨鬆零六二五、為三便士九零六二五、美匯現貨長零九三七五、為六元一二五、申匯降一元二角五分、為一百零五元七角五分、「聯鈔」暗盤賤五角、為一百零一元五角、</p>
<h3>英美金鎊　所漲最巨　美票次之</h3>
<p>昨日外幣巿况、忽又趨漲、　英鎊價格果又趨軟、黑市美匯因又吿緊、並因紛傳偽「中央政治會議」業已在南京舉行、以致一般投機者流、又羣起搜購、美票金直綫飛漲、英美金鎊奔騰殊烈、僅香港票供給較暢、市勢反見疲弱、日金票漲風未戢、晚巿高至一元三角三分、朝鮮票需要稍增、晚市為九角九分、昨日市價、以英美金鎊各漲一元五角為最巨次推美金票、漲三角二分、英金票亦升一角、法郎票高二厘、羅比票昂五發、斐律濱票升一角、僅香港票獨降五厘、餘俱不動、</p>
<h3>歐局和平空氣消散　黃金漲風再起　重出五千一百元關外</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、績入興奮狀態中、以最低價五千〇四十元開盤、直抬至五千一百十七元高價、原因環境利多、如在之登台說、至少刺激人心、而歐局和平希望渺小、美英滙兌報縮、均使經營者進多出少、中某證券帮大量加碼、影響最巨、銀號帮代本帮搜買亦甚可觀、更聞港帮仍有活動、但今日下午因辦理交割無市、而明後接速四天之假期、恐减少一般買戶之活動、故昨日之漲焰、恐難繼續於今日、</p>
<p>烚赤漲七十七元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開滙市報緊、人氣頗佳、某銀號與證券帮等買意尤濃、開巿遂抬起十二元、銀號互做五十兩、為五千〇四十元、嗣同賣者寥落、祇某錢兌業略有塞出、故再拉高二十八元、證券帮進銀號五十兩、為五千〇六十八元、此後外滙忽報回硬、賣氣稍濃、錢兌業及銀樓帮等先後吐出、曾回小十四元、證券帮出銀號十兩、為五千〇五十四元、旋證券帮及某銀號買意重萌、同時某錢兌業亦競相收買、旦斯時外滙復緊、提高四十四元、銀號互做三十兩、為五千〇九十八元、時因五千一百元限價賣者頗多、致買風稍殺、而某錢梵業獲利復吐目現金號亦乘高塞出、遂回小十元、錢兌業吐予金號五十兩、為五千〇八十八元、顧以某證券帮冉來搜入、又漲起七元、證券帮進銀號三十兩、為五千〇九十五元、將近收盤時、金號忽來吐出、遂小三元、金號出銀號五十兩、為五千〇九十二元作午收價、午後巿勢更堅、開巿即高八元、證券帮進金號五十兩、為五千一百元、後證券帮與銀號一再扒進、而售者不肯輕易脫手、見勢扳價頗夥、遂於交易淸稀中、再步漲十七元、銀號進現金號五十兩、為五千一百十七元、入後買者中止活動、而一般散多乘高吐出、銀樓帮亦有拋賣、遂回小十二元、銀號互做五十兩、為五千一百〇五元作晚收價、結果比上日狂漲七十七元、全天七十七元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高數元、收進减低二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>首飾金掛高五元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸五百十元、迨至十時三刻、掛高五元、此後無變化、結果大同行改懸五百十五元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低十五元光景、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆囤戶又起　行情回元許</h3>
<p>昨日雜糧油豆巿塲中之市况、全日波浪頗多、起伏結果、大跌小回、其潛勢照收盤時之態度、因交易大都是搶帽子式之囤戶、故大局未可樂觀、黃豆市連跌一週、人心不免活動、昨趁油市轉頭之機、囤戶又來拖進、行情轉升四五角至元許、計開蚌埠豆六車、價詳市價欄、蕪湖豆五車、南京豆一百三十餘包、安慶豆二百包、揚州山黃三百五十包、及崇明沙黃六十包、今日有豆子六百十包運往香港、</p>
<h3>糧食　食米又有乘廉居積　囤洋米者已不無打擊</h3>
<p>米市自棧存豐富、各棧乘機加租、若羅斯福等棧一月改作兩期、因之又多軋棧租一種問題、况大批本月份期貨洋米、又陸續到達、銀根繁重、一般貨主在環境壓迫之下、遂致不惜身本、忍痛脫手、行巿竟瀉十四五元之巨、悉打破四十元大關、高似一號西貢祇售三十七八元、低如小絞等尖僅三十四五元、而混合碎次已二十八九元、且該批現貨、都屬春初及隔年貨居多、身本頗重、休說獲利無人、即保本亦少、囤戶受此打擊、原為應有之報、並不足惜、蓋大衆吃苦已不少矣、昨市晨初、一般浮囤散戶、仍有售出、各價又落近元、若小絞曾至三十四元、但原根客販不再輕脫、且又重起操縱、乘廉拉進、一時市上籌碼頓稀、反感不敷、結果莧能將早市跌價恢復、較前巿增高半元光景、計收盤一號西貢為三十九元、二號三十五元半、火絞三十六元八角、小絞二十五元半、二號暹羅三十五元半、東京砶尖三十五元、混合碎三十一元半、糯米巿因到源驟湧、昨抵界內不下二千餘包、且他貨一再猛落、行情遂削短一元左右、厚薄粳及早晚稻等國米、河下昨到南港貨十餘般、其車運由虹口轉出者亦夥、不下三千餘包、一般貨主目見洋米巳祇售三十餘元、當此環境、亦乏守特之旨、悉謀早脫、况天時漸暖、身骨較弱之貨、最易變化、故業在市上出樣者頗多、依限開出早晚稻四十元、三十九元半、三十九元三角、且斛見次貨祗三十六七元、至於厚薄粳高貨、正市尙無、仍屬塲外暗盤、聞說特錫粳四十五元、市貨四十三四元、崑特粳四十四元、市四十二三元、靑泗特薄四十二三元、特早稻四十一二元云、</p>
<p>米市塲管理委員會公舍小廣寒米巿塲、於國歷本月二十三·二十四兩日為掃墓節、休業兩天、二十五日起照常營業云、</p>
<p>洋米原包昨晨開價繼續下挫、現貨續小三四角、但貨方以成本高昂、虧折過鉅、而目下定價則與滬上回籠價相差四元之鉅、因此大多擯不售出、二號西貢上午一度開四十三元二角、午後即昂至四十四五元扯盤、小絞上午亦喊四十三元左右未妥、午後亦高至四十四五元、一號西實初喊四十八元七角、後以貨方加碼未妥、</p>
<p>洋米又到二萬二千餘包、係捷成洋行之法蘭姆Fram（譯音）號輪、自暹羅運來、巳於前日（十八日）傍晚六時五十分抵滬、停靠於浦東其昌棧起卸、（祖）</p>
<h3>粉市岑寂　麥價平穩</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨市二號廠盤、雖經廠方擬定十三元八角、各號門售改為每包十四元、而當局對於平賣事件、猶在考慮、故正式行巿、尙待今明發表、昨平賣粉已暫吿停頓、本街方面之需要者、儘可向廠零批、大致已恢復、惟客銷依然寂寞、各廠亦尙未接應客銷、因此市面淸閑、聞老車牌回籠貨又見鬆疲、上午價祇十三元九角、後巿做開十三元九角五分、其他各牌概乏正式成交、又聞切麵業要求抑平粉價、以十二元為限、故當避與廠方尙須再度磋商、方可公佈、</p>
<p>小麥　昨巿續居平站、貨主方面、以目下國麥來源旣枯、存底日薄、洋麥雖有運到、而新定難於合劃、故售意始終帶緊、惟廠方則一味擇巧而取、致雙方又趨擯持狀態、聞阜豐廠略辦三百包、價仍為二十三元五角、</p>
<h3>紗花　外滙轉縮　紗市重振　四月期雙馬紗做到九百七十九元</h3>
<p>上日大落之紗市、昨則又復回升、實緣外匯轉縮、黃金昂騰、以致人心良好、多方紛紛活動、巿盤乃上漲、但一般空方、因海外印美棉市不振、且印棉購訂尤廉、對於四月期拋空心思尤切、惟多方鑒於匯票一緊、買風特熾、紗市前途關鍵仍在匯巿上作進退也、四月期、馬始做九百六十四元、收盤　到九百七十九元云、</p>
<p>現紗晨開因外匯改縮、人心重振、二十支雙馬三月期開價為九百五十二元、此時買者稍踴、再升至九百五十六元、價格高後、空方活動又復回下至九百五十一元、迨至十一時後、聞美匯甚軟、及金子又昂、買氣陡濃、再漲至九百五十七元、查半日間成交統計二千一百二十包、行情二十支雙馬現貨漲十一元、今日有紗三百件運海防、一百件運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>香港四一〇　內地二五</p>
<p>同行一、六八五統計二、一二〇</p>
<h3>假前棉市　愈覺沉悶</h3>
<p>本棉交易轉趨沉悶、惟美棉生意、較為活動、且均係靑島幫辦去、至於廠方僅日廠同興買一百件、在四月底收銀款送廠、其他未見起色、印棉近日購訂價格甚為廉宜、茲將現棉成交情形列左、</p>
<p>米特林　二六七·五〇　同行進三〇〇件</p>
<p>又　二六七·〇〇　又　二〇〇件</p>
<p>阿非利加　二十三·〇〇　又　二七三件</p>

<p>常熟花　二〇八·〇〇　又　三三五包</p>
<p>米特林　二七五·〇〇　同行時　一〇〇件</p>
<p>另訊、外棉巿價、紐約棉巿，昨日晨初先因外商之賣出而跌後稍因紐奧綸期幫及華爾街之購買而回漲、結果收盤價格近期不動、遠期昇起二至四磅音、印度昨日又跌三羅餘、預測回漲、埃及跌十餘磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來殊為靜寂、各方俱無交易聞、印度棉市米能振作、且耶穌復活節即將屆臨、廠方俱抱觀望態度、且日來到貨甚多、故交易異常靜寂、茲將昨日棉巿以美匯六元四三七五、折合送廠價如下、</p>
<p>二十支　美米特林　二六〇·八〇</p>

<h3>證劵　內債浮多出籠　洋股依然堅昂</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日巿况、因環境消息不利、又以　　起將有四日之假期、多方不願冒險負此無謂之利息、頗多了結、南京表演愈益露骨、期貨交易、顧忌太多、難成事實、市上不乏浮多出籠、丙種九元頓又退進、形勢又趨軟化、正式行市須俟假期後、因今日祗做上午半日交易、午後即行停巿、又因於假期前需將買賣交割手續一律淸楚、昨日上午交易平穩帶疲、各戶大都均有掉換交易、故時有進此出彼之買賣、市價亦稍稍疲落、午後聯和潤利及聯益賣出甚多、市氣更萎、雖有三十八及四十一以及鴻大同康等吸收抵補、但仍供過於求、丙種九元關頭頓又敲破結果回小二角半至五角不等、成交約有一百三四十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交中一信託公司睽一百股除利息、價九元七角五分、</p>
<p>衆業公所報吿隔晚美國各市塲行情報漲、公衆深信歐洲和平展望、未免言之過早、股巿開　堅穩、半日間買方對於各股興趣甚濃、雖無驚人發展、國際信託、上海銀公司、會德豐等股趨勢之堅亦堪注目、收盤時前者為一十四元二五、及二十五元、後者亦回升至一百三十二元半、怡和股始終穩定、英聯股因怠工風潮略吿疲軟、收盤各股需求均佳、橡皮股之在日前、曾受巨創而被過分壓低者、昨日開盤突轉堅俏、價格回漲甚劇、成交龐大、蘭格志特形活潑、回騰至三十三元收盤、該股最近因謠傳其獲利展望欠佳、而被大量傾賣價格因之每况愈下、但頃巳證明此項謠傳全屬子虛</p>

<h3>夫婦知識</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培　性病專科醫師詹念曾合著</p>

<p>（時間）上午十時至下午六時星期日休息</p>
<p>愛情中靈肉一致的問題　愛情是必須要佔領全身心的，　再由全身心開出燦爛之花！</p>
<p>靈是心靈，也就是精神，肉是肉體，也就是肉慾。我們揭開天窗說亮話：無論他是道學先生，宗敎家……他們如果要走進愛情氛圍裏的時候，就免不掉精神與肉體的作用，所以靈肉一致實是愛情唯一的原則。一對夫婦，若老是口惠而實不止，或是實惠得太少，不足以滿足對方需要的時候，任他把精神方面的愛情，說得『天花亂墮』，恐怕他們整個兒的愛情也要像肥皂泡一樣，一經風就要破裂了。這有很多的事實可以證明：楊貴妃在性飢渴的時候，爲什麼不能愛高力士？潘金蓮爲何要愛上武松？富有資產與地位的官僚或富商，他們的嬌妻美妾，爲什麼要下堂求去？柴米夫妻，他們爲什麼反很滿足而愉快？一切的一切，均可以證明着愛情是必須要靈肉一致的，能靈肉一致，那就美滿而幸福，不能靈肉一致，那就缺陷而痛苦！</p>
<p>西諺有云：『健全的精神寓於健全的身體』，靈與肉均須以身體健康爲基礎。所以男子能身體健壯，精力豐足者，除非他已另有所歡，吾則他的愛情必然熱烈而　綣，爲其妻者，眞是幸福之至！可是男子若曾犯自　縱慾，虧損了生殖腺內分泌液，使精力衰弱，有早洩，陽痿，發育不全，精薄不育等症象者，則妻貌如花，雖欲愛之，心有餘而力不足也，若長此下去，妻的靑春虛度一，情懷不歡，由此抑鬰成疾者有之，情不自禁，因男子之勾一在引，與人私通私奔，或振振一以有詞與夫訴請離婚之訟者，若今日社會中亦時有見開！所治爲丈夫者，必須精力豐足，經有衰弱症象必須及早治愈。療之法：據世界名醫及余等驗，均以服健壯動物生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』最爲對症特效。固此劑質料名貴，功效確實，藥性和平，補力偉大，爲任何類似製劑所不及。男子於服後一日夜間卽可生精補腎，健腦活血，允貴繼續連服，則更助長發育，滋稠精血，上述症象，必可於短期內完全治愈，使精力格外豐足。中老年人常服，則延年益壽，返老還童。惟有遺精者，須兼服特效藥『希米脫氏固精片』（中西五洲火藥房及永安公司西藥　均售每匣兩元）以制止潰洩，收效允速。</p>
<h3>乳峯萎的威脅與補救</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>我眞佩服上海裁縫司務手段的高妙，你　：一個女性身上的全部輪廓，如乳峯，臀部，腰圍，　胂，都能够在一襲旗袍上充分的顯露出來，使得曲線明朗，姿態曼妙，這是何等有助於女性的健美？可是話又要說回來了，上海裁縫司務的手段雖然高妙、能做出恰到好處的新裝，然而亦祇限於身體健美的女性，至於一向多病多痛，以致乳峯萎　，臀部瘦削，健美喪失的女性，則縱有驚人技藝，也是無能爲力。試問胸口癟塌塌，臀部瘦得像個活猻屁股，叫他那裏可以運用木領呢？雖然有人說，乳峯萎癟，可以用義乳來假裝，但假裝的僅能遮羞於一時，遲早總要戳穿西洋鏡，如一旦蘭湯待浴，遍體無存，或『春閨低垂銷金帳，鴛鴦衾里效雙飛』時，那將何所遁形？不惟此也，而男子之心，什九容易丕變，當雙方愛好無間時，固尙能勉守，若一旦女性的劣跡或醜態被地發覺時，則未有不見異思遷，另我對像，或則尋花問柳，視家庭似傳舍，或則金屋藏嬌，視妻子如陌路，夫婦之名存實亡，故健美喪失之女性，可不懔然知懼乎？至於補救之法。在今日科學昌明時代，亦至易易，據中西名醫及余經騐。祇須服以生殖腺卵巢內分泌製劑女用『性殖素』，則一日夜間即可培補卵巢一機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，　整月經，暖宮止帶，倘繼續服用，担保能於短期內使乳峯高聳，紅潤面頰，增進健美。</p>
<h3>遺精靑年當心春瘟</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>春天果然是萬物蓬勃的季節，同時也是疾病孳生的時候。一個精力强壯富有抵抗力的男子，在此暖和的春天，當然益顯其健壯而活潑。可是一個患有遺精症的靑年，因爲精力的衰弱，抵抗力的缺乏，那就感覺春氣多厲，動不動就傷風咳嗽，頭昏腦脹，腰酸背痛，或竟感染春瘟，一病兼旬，則時間金錢與精神之損失，何可計算？然此猶小焉者也，若春瘟而經年累月，或竟不治，則豈不誤了前途，葬送了靑春幸福，斷送了生命嗎？</p>
<p>原來男子體內的精液，在生理學上即所謂生殖腺內分泌液，能直接滲於血內而灌溉全身，功能助長發育，滋養神經，調節情緒，發動愛情，而尤能增强抵抗，防禦疾病。所以靑年人能潔身自愛，保持其精力豐足者，則必體貌雄偉，思想淸明，性能强健，前途幸福無量！若不知自愛，犯自凟縱慾，使精關鬆弛，繼起遺精，既患遺精而復因循失治，則勢必致精力枯竭，爆發腦衰健忘，失眠心悸，腰酸背痛，早洩陽痿，發育不全等症，此種靑年，必然求學不進，習業難成，更將爲女性所棄，妻妾所恨，尙復有何前途與幸福之可言</p>
<p>今特忠吿靑年：自凟縱欲，切不可犯，既患遺精，允須速治，治法：以服德國眞正老牌「希米脫氏固精片」最爲簡便而有特效。因此藥功能鞏固精關，鎭靜神經，服後於當夜即可安眠止遺。因遺精巳有上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』以培補腦腎，精而及神經，必可於短期內恢復美滿健康。患者若能親來本診所診治，更可保證治愈。</p>

<p>保持永遠不發之白濁</p>
<p>淋病之每爲一般人望而生厭的花柳病，蓋因此病毒，較之梅毒下疳等病，更難治萬倍。以梅毒而言，現在已有『六〇六』和『九一四』之特效藥發明，此猛烈之梅毒，已無足慮，獨有淋病一症，迄今尙未有特效藥之發明，以是患基多。故急慢性白濁蔓延於社會，夫豈偶然？其實以現代科學之進步，淋病治療，已得到眞確之解決，彼抱殘守缺之醫家，輒以　陋惡劣之醫械，粗野之手術，敷衍塞資，病毒永述不能脫離吾人，變症蜂起，絕嗣育，傾生命，多由淋病患者失治後之結果。</p>
<p>余在國內各大花病病院担任淋病科主任，十數寒暑以來，於近代淋病療法之進步，靡不留心研究，而最近德國發明之濾淋平流電療法，於淋病治療法上，實開一新紀兀，在余曆年臨床之實騐，凡一般急慢性淋病，如前尿道炎，攝護腺炎，精　炎，睪丸炎，關節炎，膀胱炎，及直腸炎等，均用濾淋平流電療，更相機輔用手術，及最新化學療法，德國希氏驅淋血淸作靜脈之注射，及用提　帶以支持發炎腫大之　丸，並令靜養依此療治，絕對可在短期中完全根治，愈後並由病家送工部局衛生處檢驗，絕無淋菌，故能永保根治。</p>

<p>鍾馗嚇賊</p>
<p>上月二十三日，三鼓後，舊閶門外許巷中某學究家，各人　歇睡，獨坐兀坐危樓，就燈觀書，突聞樓　有人，吁然失聲，五體投地。當即秉燭趨視，則一梁上君子倒暈墻角，四肢俱冰，惟氣息未絕，急為灌醒，詢其緣由。竊者云，甫踰垣入室，取火燎望，猛見巨人赤面朱鬚，紅衣絳靴，舉手欲搏，蓋不知其是神是鬼，是妖是怪，今始知為畫上之人也。先是某有硃砂鍾馗一幅，因學徒潑水於畫，彼日正懸掛壁間，以待乾燥。竊者心虛膽怯，以偽疑真，不覺魂飛魄奪耳。</p>

<h3>動</h3>
<p>— 黃喜音</p>
<p>動，因爲這是一個動的世界。</p>
<p>幾白年前，蝸牛的散步，可以用來象徵世界的動：在今日、唯有飛機與閃電能够表現世界的動的速度。</p>
<p>在大學校的一間課室裏，當年高德劭的歷史學敎授講演完畢的時候？十幾個熱心求知的靑年蜂　到講臺前去了一先生，請吿訴我們你對於左派和右派的意見。先生一，你是左貨還是右傾？」</p>
<p>敎授摸着灰白的鬍鬚微笑了。</p>
<p>「靑年人，」他說，「左與右是一種不很明確的分類法。世界上的方向除了左右之外，還有兩種傾向，一種是向前的，進步的，還有一種是退後的，落伍的。我祇希望自已是一個向前進步的人。因爲，」他說着，把手用力撥着桌上的地球儀，地球儀滾滾地轉動着。於是他繼續說，「因爲世界是動的，是一直在進步着的。」</p>
<p>這位我們所敬愛的老敎授也許是在躱避着我們的問題，可是他的話却給我們每個入很深刻的印象與指示。動，因爲世界正在動着。</p>

<h3>護士自述</h3>
<p>— 自修</p>
<p>一個正式護士，必需經過三個階段，第一個階段是平年的試讀，第二個階段是三年的學生生活，最後經過護士會會考及格發給文憑，到這時候，才算是個正式可以服務在國內任何醫院的護士。巾試讀升爲正式護士的三年中間，病房工作的時候由二小時逐漸增爲八小時，在病房工作，無非做些倒痰盂，擦便桶，替病人舖床，擦澡，服業等一類的工作所以與其說三整年的病房工作，倒不如直截爽快的說是做三個整年的老媽子。在一般人看來，病人稱妳小姐「密史」，其實我們所處的實際地位，同一般公館裏的僕役是沒有什麼兩樣！</p>
<p>在這國內戰事正酣的孤島，女子要想得一個學些將來能自文自給，不做人及社會的寄生蟲的技能的地方，可說辦法很少。尤其像我們這些故鄕侖一陷，要升學事實上不許可的女子，更加上一重險峻的難關！我在去年夏天，經過一度苦幹，考入了一個高級職業護士女校，當時從一二百人錄取三十名的當中，我能一個位置，那時間家庭對希望，以及我個人內心的歡，決不是一枝筆可以形容得出來的。由希望成了事實，織了學雜費，穿上護士學生的制服，因爲是在試讀階段，頭上還不够資格帶護士帽。進了學校四個月，因爲院裏生意好極，爲我們是一個年靑的女子，心理上祇有坦白與熱誠，在病房裏，不管病人是如何的無理取鬧，不管護士長吹毛求疵，嚴辭責備，我總記得俗語說：「吃盡苦中苦，方爲人上人」，所以那時間，一切因勞作而精神上的，疲憊，因受自以爲老資格的護士長的責備，而內心所起的怨忿，是怎樣，總以十二分的堅決意志，抱着「忍辱負重，埋頭苦幹」的精神來苦幹。因爲理想着人的一生本來天天在走着曲折不平的道路，要想得一技之長後的「自由」「快樂」，這莫非是必經的階段。</p>
<p>時光如飛一般地過去，半年試讀已怱怱而過，學期大考到了，憑着平日有先生教之名而無先生教之實，自習得來的本事應試，（因爲一般身份高的醫生，不高與教，不過在職務上又說不過去，免強担任所以每次上課大半多祇指定自習的範圍，很少講授的時間。）　佳得很，沒有不及格的功課（規定七十分及格），有四位同學因兩門不及格而令退學，又月一位同學因一門不及格，而補考仍未及格，也令退學（其實學期通知書上只須試讀期間兩門不及格退學，並沒有因一門不及格補考又不及格時令退學的規定），那幾位同學，同我們分別的時候，她們面上所表現出內心的苦痛的愁容，令人落下幾滴同情的酸淚！</p>
<p>由卅多位同學，已减爲廿幾位同學，心中當然格外的戰戰兢兢，做着病房的工作。不幸得很，有一位同學又因病床上被醫生了現了　枚橘子，就給校長叫了去，罰說帽子一個月（護王有違犯規則以不准帶護士帽子人病房工作方式懲戒），校長並且用她一付猙獰的語調說：「始們還沒有資格帶帽子，妳們未來的挫折多着呢！一我心裏吏加上了一層恐慌，不知道將來的命運又將遇着如何的遭遇…</p>
<p>我希望學校裏的校長，醫生，護士長，能各盡其職，各本良心，以身作則，尊重學生人格來指導。人孰無過，我們本來四『學』而來，父那會沒有小的錯處，懲戒的方式不妨寬些！更希望爲醫學界上增多才，洗刷東亞病夫的奇恥大的遠大目光，對我們限於智能，勞力精神所不夠　的地方多加原諒。事先不把學校懲戒的規則通知家長，而突然間加以處罰，至勒令中途退學，關於這幾點，希望能多加考慮改舊，毌令受刺激太甚，而發生意外的可怕的變故！</p>

<h3>靑春的心理</h3>
<p>— 宋景濂</p>
<p>國亞力遜那州大學心理學系，有過一個有趣的測騐，據他們所得的結果，以爲智能並不能帮助女生去吸引男子，而只能帮助她們在學校裏得好分數。</p>
<p>該測騐並勸吿一般女生在應接，款待，娛樂，遊藝等的藝術方面，多用點功夫，假使要得到男子的愛惰的話。</p>
<p>道個測騐是一級五十餘位學生合作的結果，他們並謂此測騐結果不僅適用於女子，即是男子亦能適合云。</p>
<p>該校心理學系主哈頓博士對其澳騐的結果最引以爲異的，並非應接，款待，娛樂等的藝術爲吸引男子最重要的要素，而爲智能僅列入吸引男子之最重要八種要素的末位而已。哈頓博士並謂此測騐的結果，至少巳將男學校學生最喜歡以智能高超的女子爲其終身伴侶的理論完全打倒了。</p>
<p>哈頓博士最後發出樂觀的結論，他說：「此測騐最重要結論，是社會上名人的大部份美點可爲任何人所得到，祇要能努力硏究改進。同時若肯在化裝，舉止，談吐……等方面用功，吾人之大部份缺點，亦能消除」。我們但願他的結論是對的，希望世界上有情人皆成眷屬。</p>

<h3>明天今天</h3>
<p>— 黎離</p>
<p>我知道，八年前一個人就計劃着讀一些書－當他有空的時候。可是，直到現在還沒有翻過，自然將來也決不會翻的。他的雄心已爲近延的手所格殺了。</p>
<p>我們不該尋我一種口實把現在該做的事拖延到明天。否則，一切終將成爲泡影。浪費掉今天的現實寄希望於明天的幻想中，多傻！不過這樣的人却多着呢。</p>
<p>「明天冉說吧。」這是多熟悉的話語。但，請記住，雖然今天最長祇有二十四小時，而明天却是無窮的呢。那麽，恐怕終不免永遠是一句空話吧？</p>
<p>你不能把自己跟現在隔開，而專注意明天將怎樣怎樣。不管你願意與否，你總歸是活在現在的。</p>
<p>因此，問題的核心是活下去。在現實世界的每日生活中，你將學會如何生活的知識。它如同一把神奇的鑰匙，可以開啟明天的快樂的實藏——當時間把明天推到現在的時候。</p>

<h3>羅漢九尊</h3>
<p>— 竺迅</p>
<p>據崑山通信載稱，角直保聖寺的　漢業已裏渡，尙乘者僅有四尊，但早晚仍難保全。考此項古物，確爲我國歷史上東南地理之希有古跡，惜我國人不加注意，雖一度經地方當局會同保管修茸，面我國人前往遊覽者仍寥寥，但日人幾每暇必往，早已垂涎三尺。按此項羅漢爲唐陽元中張僧繇弟子楊　子所塑，距人今已有）千四百餘年，而保聖寺創立於蕭梁武帝天鑒年（公元五〇三年），宋祥符時重建，明崇禎時再修葺。</p>
<p>惠子原塑難漢共十八尊，已詳載甫里志中，甫里爲叫直古稱，因詩人陸　蒙，甫里先生而得名；現存於寺中之羅漢像，本共九尊，後有尊被盜，故祇存八尊，共一虬髯蟒袍、舉目仰視，謂降龍，最爲神妙；其一怒目袒腹，伸臂捏奉，稱伏虎；中央者靜坐閉目，肖帝王，傳指梁武帝；共一容貌淸廟，張口作笑；其一貌淸秀，壯一瘦，情趣異別；後貌莊嚴，氣象萬千。故八個像各有其不同個性，含情，眞量，充實其中，非聖塑家難以表出；其塑工之精巧，可見一般。而我國人素不加注意，以坟荒蕪此大好古蹟。至民國七年，文人顧讀遊　，－一年重遊，幾見湮沒，乃爲之呼籲，刊小說月報，乃爲東洋美術史學家大村西崖，爲遠數千里而來，攝照　十八幀，詳予引證，成「壁塑殘影」一書，於是轟動各國藝術史家，咸來考究。後經蔡孑民先生書，奔走呼號，乃組織保管會，由汪中鶼先生整理殘跡，寺外之門形若牌坊，有乾隆書「輔揚　秘」四字？</p>
<p>與保聖寺同遺者尙存科棋，幢礎，筒瓦，獸頭　物，後均兢民教館中，至於楊惠子所塑除保圣寺罗　外，尚有崑山慧聚寺天王像云。</p>

<h3>「蒙古之子」全部攝竣</h3>
<p>— 秋雯</p>
<p>記　得在一九三五年的秋天就傳來了一個驚人的捷報，就是蘇聯政府將決定協助蒙古共和國攝製一張國防影片「蒙古之子」，那時也許有人會驚奇，怎样蒙古人也會想到拍電影，其實我們從另一面觀察下來，當然知道是受到蘇聯政府的引誘所致，雖然蒙古人已無形中受到蘇聯政府威脅而被人所利用，但在整個劇情方面的處置，據說的確還不失去國防影片的意義。在全片中，他已明晰地告訴蒙古人民應該怎樣起來抵抗第三國的侵略和蹂躪，他更進一步吿訴蒙古人民應該用甚麼方法來應付那未來的敵人。</p>
<p>劇本的內容，確實是很大胆的，全劇除了描寫蒙古人民特有的羅曼史外，其餘差不多全是對某國的一種示威，他吿訴了我們某國在蒙古是如何壓迫蒙古人民，把蒙古人當作朝鮮第二一般，最後且把蒙古人的幾種特殊貿易，都非法的搶奪了去，眞的，我們覺得被壓迫的民族應當喚醒給全世界人士去法意來共同救救這些可憐的民族。然而我們從另一方面來觀察，那末爲巷麼某國也不在蒙古攝製一張影片去暴露他們的陰謀呢？這當然是因爲及不到蘇聯的緣故呀！據說這影片的剧情，是由蘇聯政府所編製，主角人選差不多全由蒙古人充任。至於飾演某國人的則一部份由蘇聯演員充任，全片外景則大都攝自蒙古，至於內景洗剪等手續則全由蘇聯着手，全部影片也是有聲對白的蒙古語，在最近蘇聯某一張機關報上，會贊美這部影片是代表中國政府攝製的國防影片代表作，不過還要吿訴讀者的就是這一部紀念蒙古共和國二十週紀念的禮物－蒙古之子－在我們這裏，是賞光不到的，因爲他們不需要讓我們看見了，而增加天生的忿恨，所以這部影片究竟內容是怎樣，筆者也不敢妄加判斷了。</p>
<h3>谈「萬世师表」</h3>
<p>— 華爾芝</p>
<p>「萬世師表」去年度獲選十大巨片冠軍，及藝術學院的金獎片，在美國公映時，其賣座收入，並不遜色於好萊塢歷史上的任何巨片：在英國，曾在四家第一輪戲院同時開映，滿座兩週。現在大華大戲院定於今日起公映，「萬世師表」的原著人是傑姆斯希爾頓，他在學校時代就喜歡向各報投寄稿件，第一篇作品在孟却斯脫導報發表，那時他祇十七歲。在倫敦畢業後，沒有我到職業，因爲和愛爾蘭獨立報的編者是朋友，他就經常寫一點稿子來維持生活。一九三一年，他寫了「現在再會了」，才使他在文壇上獲得一點地位。至於寫（萬世師表」的動機，那是一個雜誌編輯向他徵求一個中篇小說，要在兩星期內繳卷，第一個星期過去了，希爾頓還沒有動手，或許是環境關係，他想有一次旅行，即使放棄這部小說的稿費也可以：但是在他沒有啟程之前，突然地，（烟士披里純」降臨到他書桌之前，一個吉潑斯那樣的人物在他筆底下產生，四天之內，完成了這部傑作（再會吧！吉潑斯先生！」「一萬世師表一的原名）</p>
<p>筆者沒有機會讀到他的原著，但是被賽姆華特搬上銀幕的「萬世師表」却有相反地在一個偶然的機會中看到了。那位突然跳到希爾頓筆底下的吉潑斯，是一個畢生盡瘁於敎育事業的敎師」而且是一個非常可愛的人物，不過，也祇僅僅是（鞠躬盡瘁」而已，他沒有替吉潑斯創迭一個在敎育或學術上有偉大供獻的學者，這是不免爲這傑作遜色的。同時，羅曼斯的煊染，在銀幕上看來，也仿佛是「插入的一段，至少在整個故事上這是不甚調和的」節。因爲是巨著，是巨片，這點私見希望不要認爲是過於苛求</p>
<p>至於勞勃杜奈的吉潑斯，從少年到老年，都充份地把握了這一人物的特殊性格，在遇見葛麗亞嘉孫的反常狀態，及看到第三代學生的長大時的衷心喜悅，演技之神化，在好萊塢的小生羣中，恐怕是難求的一個。化妝方面，非常出神，導演手法，也樸素而生動。</p>
<p>最近好萊塢的競爭文藝片，傳奇片，確是可喜的現象，而「孩兒樂園」，「萬世師表」的獲獎，更充份證明電影所負的使命。國產電影的古裝片似乎有每况愈下的傾向，前天本刋的「建議，」希望從事電影事業者有所省悟。</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>An Interpretation of Peace</h3>
<p>Those who bear the heavy responsibility of national affairs never speak lightly of war in times of peace, nor do they speak lightly of peace in times of war. Even when brewing for peace during wartime, they will not openly discuss peace until they are sure of it. This is because policies should not be changed lightly, morale and public sentiment should not be relaxed or tightened rashly, and the benefits and harms of the nation should not be lightly tested. This is how statesmen should behave, this is how they should be responsible, and only in this way can they be called statesmen and bear the heavy responsibility of the nation. In Chinese history, whenever troops were used abroad or to defend the borders, the grand strategy was decided in the imperial court, and the court officials' arguments for and against war always existed side by side. This was because "the people can be made to follow, but cannot be made to understand," resulting in a gap between the court and the public, and internal and external obstructions. This was a disease of the times and is not a good example for today. Today, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek has repeatedly announced to the people that they must endure hardship and resist until the final victory. His firm and resolute stance has been met with nationwide approval. This is truly an innovation in Chinese history. However, is this not the case with modern statesmen in various countries? For example, British Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in his speech to the House of Commons the other day that Britain is rising up to fight to achieve its ideal peace goals, and will not stop fighting until it achieves its goals. The German government yesterday denied the talk of a peace offensive, saying that since Germany's proposal for peace last year was rejected, it will no longer launch any peace initiatives in the future. Both Britain and Germany have adopted "fight until victory" as their slogan, which is as firm and resolute as that of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek of China, as if they came from the same mold. This is nothing else, this is how modern statesmen should behave, this is how they must behave.</p>
<p>The bloody war between China and Japan will soon be three years old, and there is still no sign of a cessation of hostilities or peace talks. Although Wang Jingwei has called for peace and has gained the support of the Japanese cabinets of Konoe, Hiranuma, Abe, and Yonai, and has taken some actions in the occupied areas in the posture of establishing a "government," Japan still openly admits that it cannot end the so-called "China Incident" as a result, and is still making every effort to deal with its unprecedentedly large wartime budget. This shows that Japan has not yet revised its policy of aggression and abandoned its aggressive military operations, and it also shows that China has no choice but to continue its resistance. This is an objective fact that does not require evaluation and cannot be concealed, and it is also a clear trend that cannot be concealed. As for the European war, this newspaper has already inferred yesterday that it is in the process of brewing a settlement, and has briefly cited some clues to indicate the possibility of an early cessation of hostilities. At this time when the brewing process has not yet been revealed, it is of course impossible to assert the success or failure of the brewing. However, the determination expressed by the British and German authorities and the slogans they have advocated are not enough to disprove the success of the brewing. The revelation of failure may be seen in the future in the new actions taken by the warring countries on both sides or any one side to strengthen the atmosphere of war, or it may be heard from US Under Secretary of State Welles after his return to the United States, or from a long sigh from US President Roosevelt or Secretary of State Hull. The revelation of success will not come until Welles reports back.</p>
<p>As for the present, the most optimistic thing is that the general meaning of peace is gradually becoming clear. It is good that Roosevelt broadcast to the world five days ago: "We should seek a peace based on morality today. If the world cannot become brothers, there is no true peace; if the fruits of peace are oppression, hunger, cruelty, or weapons are superior to humanity, there is no lasting peace; if small countries live under the threat of powerful countries, there is no stable peace; if freedom is deprived by aggression, there is no moral peace; if the will and thought of mankind are suppressed, there is no reasonable peace; if God is denied, there is no righteous peace; from the end of the last European war to today's European war, the world has not had a peace based on this"; therefore, "the world is seeking true peace, enough to guarantee the sovereignty of small countries and the freedom of religious culture." We approve of Roosevelt's interpretation of peace and support it to promote its realization. Thus, imagining that Welles has visited the major European powers, started his journey yesterday, and returned full of cargo, we will not ask what kind of content fills his bag. However, the revelation of the brewing process will certainly not deviate from the outline of Roosevelt's interpretation, which can be trusted without doubt.</p>
<p>After Roosevelt broadcast his views on peace, the reactions of praise from all sides can be seen in the Chinese and foreign newspapers in recent days. The most noteworthy of these is that two days after Roosevelt's broadcast, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German leader Hitler had a long talk at the Brenner Pass. After the long talk, there has been no dissent so far on what Roosevelt has so keenly stated. Three days after Roosevelt's broadcast, British Prime Minister Chamberlain openly accepted Roosevelt's interpretation of peace in his speech to the House of Commons and stated that what Britain is fighting for is only a peace of this interpretation. We believe that since the meaning of peace has been clarified, it can be used in theory to judge the right and wrong of all kinds of arguments for war and peace, and to analyze the boundaries between international peace and anti-peace in policy. In fact, the source and scope of belief can brew a movement towards true peace. We believe that Welles will certainly not make a futile trip, Roosevelt will certainly not waste his words, and the American people will certainly not fail to live up to the great strength of their nation, sit idly by and watch the rise and fall of good and evil, and only talk about the truth of peace!</p>

<p>Washington: US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau opposed Townsend's bill to stop purchasing foreign silver yesterday when he appeared before the Senate Banking and Currency Committee. Morgenthau claimed that since the US began its silver purchase policy, the government has purchased silver worth US $218,060,000 from China. "This purchase has greatly benefited friendly countries in obtaining the US dollars they need through silver exchange." The Senate Banking and Currency Committee plans to vote on the Townsend bill today. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>
<p>Washington: The Treasury Department announced today the statistical figures for Chinese silver imports into the United States.

<p>New York: US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau spoke to the Senate Banking and Currency Committee, opposing Senator Townsend's bill to stop purchasing foreign silver. He said that in view of the efforts of the United States to establish foreign trade and diplomatic relations, the proposed cessation of foreign silver purchases should be studied as part of the general problems of banking and currency studied by the Committee, and should not be studied alone. The Committee has agreed to vote on this proposal today. Supporters of the bill claim that it can obtain sufficient affirmative votes to submit the bill to the Senate for discussion.

<h3>British-Japanese Talks in Tokyo: Ambassador Craig Visited Arita, Conversation Concerned the Puppet Regime</h3>
<p>Tokyo: British Ambassador Craig met with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita this morning for an hour. Officials were tight-lipped about this, but the "Asahi Shimbun" reported that the two discussed the Tianjin silver issue and other pending issues between Britain and Japan. The "Hochi Shimbun" reported that the two discussed the situation in Europe and China. Craig told Arita that the Hitler-Mussolini meeting would not affect Britain's determination to deal with any situation, and that Britain would not stop until it achieved its war aims. The British ambassador also listened to Arita's explanation of the imminent establishment of the Wang regime and the situation of the Central Political Conference in Nanjing, and then said, "The British government cannot ignore the establishment of the new regime and its attitude, so the British government hopes to know the Japanese government's attitude towards the Wang regime." Arita replied that the Japanese government will absolutely assist the establishment and growth of the new regime and is prepared to recognize it early. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>London: At the House of Commons meeting this afternoon, Labor MP Price asked the government to publish the recent talks between Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Mamoru and Foreign Minister Halifax, and asked whether Japan would try to persuade Britain to mediate so that the Chongqing National Government would contact Wang Jingwei. Undersecretary Butler replied that it is common for the Japanese ambassador to visit the Foreign Office to discuss matters related to the two countries, and that the matters mentioned in the question were not mentioned at that time.

<h3>Japan Provides Supplementary Explanation on the Tianjin Blockade Issue</h3>
<p>Tianjin: A Japanese military spokesman, when receiving reporters this morning, denied the interpretation made by the outside world of his statement yesterday that "the blockade of the Tianjin concessions will only be lifted when Japan and other countries transfer their concessions to China," and issued a supplementary statement saying, "This meaning is nothing more than a joke, and it does not contain any intention that any compromise reached in Tokyo will be sufficient to lift the blockade." Colonel Morinaka reiterated that the attitude of the Japanese military authorities has not changed, and the cancellation of the blockade will depend on whether the Japanese military authorities decide that traffic restrictions are necessary.

<h3>Foreigners Sympathize with Chinese Wounded Soldiers</h3>

<h3>Chinese Government Plans to Control Important Export Commodities; The United States Continues to Assist China Financially; China's Tea Exports Have Doubled Compared to Before</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Although the Japanese navy is imposing a blockade and bombing the Yunnan Railway after occupying Nanning, China is still able to continue exporting tung oil, tea, and other commodities to fulfill its obligations. In order to ensure the effective collection and rapid export of export products, the Chinese government now plans to hand over the export of tea to the China Tea Company, tung oil to the Fuxing Company, mineral sands to the National Resources Commission, and bristles to the Foreign Trade Commission for separate control. According to sources here, the US Export-Import Bank's recent decision to lend China an additional US $10 million was prompted in part by the US desire to provide financial assistance to China and in part by China's satisfactory fulfillment of its obligations under the previous US $25 million agreement. It is said that China's tea exports in 1938 exceeded the 1937 figures by more than 10,000 boxes. Since the exchange agreement was renewed last year, tea has once again become an important commodity for export to the Soviet Union. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

<h3>Germany and Italy Deny Planning a Peace Proposal, German Government States It Will Fight Until Complete Victory, Rumors of Talks Between Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Berlin: An officially authorized announcement denies rumors of a peace plan, stating that after Hitler's sole proposal on October 6th last year was rejected, Germany will no longer speak on the issue of peace. German political circles here point to the claim that Hitler put forward an eleven-point peace plan as a foolish propaganda campaign launched by the Entente countries due to fear of the future, and state that Germany's slogan is "Fight until victory." A German Foreign Ministry spokesman told neutral journalists that people overseas still do not seem to understand that the German government has made two decisions: (1) to continue the war until complete victory; (2) for the sake of one and all, to protect Germany's important interests after victory and to end the permanent threat from the Entente democracies. It is reported that the German Foreign Ministry is now openly discussing the need for better understanding between the Soviet Union and Italy, and the visit of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to Moscow is still a possibility. (Reuters report, 20th)</p>
<p>London: The Rome correspondent of the News Chronicle recently reported that neutral observers expect that talks will continue between the governments of Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union after the meeting between the dictators of Germany and Italy at the Brenner Pass. It is likely that the Soviet government will send a high-ranking official to Berlin, and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will visit Moscow again. It is noteworthy that German leader Hitler summoned army generals for consultation after returning to Berlin yesterday. In addition, German newspapers firmly deny the claim that German leader Hitler is preparing to launch another peace offensive, stating that Germany's slogan is "No stopping until victory." German leader Hitler once proposed a peace proposal on October 6th last year, but after it was rejected by others, he is unwilling to repeat the same mistake. (Havas report, 20th)</p>
<p>Rome: "Il Giornale d'Italia" published an article by Gayda, reviewing the meeting at the Brenner Pass, briefly stating that it is hard to believe that countries have not yet asked for peace talks and that Mussolini will travel between capitals to strive for peace. The meeting between Hitler and Mussolini is not a special event, but a normal event within the alliance treaty signed on May 22, 1939, and the German-Italian Axis structure. The diplomatic representatives and economic organs of Germany and Italy maintain a cooperative relationship with each other, and the leaders of the two countries should contact each other, especially in times of emergency. Gayda pointed out that Hitler and Mussolini first held talks at the Brenner Pass, and then the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy participated. The four dignitaries did not release a report after the meeting, and the content of the talks is unknown. The rumors in the Allied newspapers are purely fabricated. Western European democracies previously regarded Italy as an "aggressor," but now repeatedly recognize Mussolini as a peace envoy, believing that he will launch a "new peace offensive" and continue to mediate the war, which is absurd and ridiculous. Mussolini made every effort to maintain peace between August and September last year. Currently, all countries have implemented armaments, and Italy will also complete its military preparations to ensure the independence and security of its other positions and interests. The famous issues arising from the European war have shown that the foundation of the German-Italian Axis is balance and cooperation. The spirit of unity between Germany and Italy has been demonstrated again by the meeting at the Brenner Pass. The main goal of the German-Italian Axis is to build a new Europe based on fairness and equality, and to protect the interests of Germany and Italy in the new European structure. (Haitong report, 20th)</p>

<p>Washington: Roosevelt's personal secretary, O'Leary, expressed disbelief today in the reported eleven-point peace plan put forward by Germany. O'Leary told reporters that the US government has not received any information that can confirm the reports of this plan.

<h3>Daladier Cabinet Submits Resignation, French Parliament Passes Vote of Confidence in Government, But Majority of Members Abstain from Voting</h3>
<p>Paris Urgent Telegram: Prime Minister Daladier has submitted the resignation of his cabinet to President Lebrun. (Havas report, 20th)</p>
<p>Paris: The resignation of the French cabinet, this decision occurred after the House of Representatives voted on a vote of confidence in the government this morning. It is expected that Lebrun will ask Daladier to form a new cabinet, which will likely be a small-scale wartime cabinet. As for Daladier's success, it will depend on the impression he gives in the secret meeting of the House of Representatives, as the public is quite alarmed by the sudden resignation of the cabinet. However, the members of the House of Representatives who participated in the secret meeting do not find it strange, as the outcome of the vote has placed the government in a difficult position. According to a speculation by political figures, the new cabinet will be organized by 3:00 PM today. It is generally believed that if Daladier agrees to form a new cabinet, he will likely give up one of the two posts he holds concurrently, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of National Defense. According to general speculation, Daladier seems more likely to give up the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs, in which case Flandin is likely to succeed him. If Daladier resigns from his concurrent position as Minister of National Defense, the likely successor will be General Nogues, Governor-General of North Africa. (Reuters report, 20th)</p>
<p>Paris: Today, the House of Representatives passed a vote of confidence in the government by a vote of 239 to 1. A large number of members abstained from voting.

<p>Paris: At the Senate meeting this afternoon, Minister Sarraut delivered a speech, stating that the government has taken various measures to deal with the various propaganda activities carried out by the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party. He also said, "The communist leaflets distributed in France are German planes." The Senate then immediately passed a vote of confidence in the government by a show of hands. It also passed a bill stipulating that all members of the House of Representatives who are sentenced for anti-national activities should be deprived of their political rights. In addition, Senator Reber requested the government authorities to explain the residency of the former Spanish Republican Foreign Minister Alvarez del Vayo and his wife in France. Minister Sarraut immediately replied that Alvarez del Vayo was initially sentenced to three months of detention for escaping to France because his passport was not properly authorized. However, on March 16th of last year, with the permission of the French authorities, he went to Mexico to attend the labor conference and strongly defended our country for the plight of Spanish refugees in France in order to refute German propaganda. He has recently returned to France and is awaiting instructions from the authorities on how to deal with it. (Havas report, 19th)</p>

<h3>Welles Departs from Italy for the United States, Issues Statement Before Departure, Denies Negotiating Peace</h3>
<p>Rome: US Under Secretary of State Welles formally completed his visit to European diplomats yesterday. He had lunch with Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano. Welles left Rome for Genoa at 11:00 PM last night to board the "Conte di Savoia" at noon today and return to the United States. (United Press report, 20th)</p>
<p>Rome: US Under Secretary of State Welles refused to answer questions raised by reporters when he met with reporters from various newspapers this afternoon. It was not until the evening that he issued a statement to clarify various rumors, stating, "My mission here is only to collect various information to report to President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull. I hereby solemnly declare that I have never received any peace proposals or other important proposals from any belligerent countries or other countries. This is the first point. I have not been ordered to submit any suggestions of any kind to any belligerent countries or other governments, nor have I ever submitted them in my personal capacity. This is the second point." In addition, Under Secretary Welles had lunch with Foreign Minister Ciano at noon today, and Prince Colonna, Governor of Rome, American Ambassador to Italy Phillips, and many other dignitaries were also present. Afterwards, he played a round of golf with Foreign Minister Ciano and talked for a long time. He then went to the US Embassy and met with Hobart, the First Secretary of the US Legation in Romania. He is scheduled to depart from here to the port of Genoa at 11:00 PM tonight to take a boat back to the United States. He will not meet with Prime Minister Mussolini again before his departure. (Havas report, 19th)</p>
<p>Vatican City: According to reliable sources from the Holy See, US Under Secretary of State Welles stated when speaking with Pope Pius XII on Sunday that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini had assured him that Mussolini did not intend to put forward Italian demands in the current stage of the conflict, so as not to cause further disputes in the situation. It is said that the Italian Prime Minister told Welles that as long as the scope of the European war remains limited, Italy does not intend to obstruct peaceful solutions, either during peace negotiations or after peace. According to sources from the Holy See, the Pope provided assurances to Welles, stating that in his observation, Mussolini's assurances were worthy of complete trust. Welles told the Pope that, based on his observations over the past six weeks, this conflict is unlikely to escalate. The Pope also told Welles that Romania tends toward safe neutrality, as does Yugoslavia. Germany is very interested in persuading the Soviet Union to maintain peace in the Balkan Peninsula.

<h3>Italy and Romania Establish Financial Agreement</h3>
<p>Rome: The financial agreement between Italy and Romania was established today. The content stipulates that the exchange rate of the Italian currency lira against the Romanian currency should be increased. Regarding petroleum, Italy originally requested that Romania sell it 400,000 tons annually, increasing it to 800,000 tons, but the Romanian government has not yet agreed and has not accepted any firm commitment. Italy then abandoned its original proposal. In this regard, political figures believe that it must be related to the successive visits to Rome by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Klodius, Director of the Economic Department of the German Foreign Ministry.

<h3>Italy Orders Coal from Bulgaria</h3>

<h3>Hungarian Prime Minister Visits Italy for Easter, Italian Newspapers Say Italy and Hungary Will Hold Talks</h3>
<p>Rome: Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki and his wife arrived in Trieste last night. After staying there for a few days, they will transfer to Rome via Florence to spend the Easter holiday. Italian newspapers today all published articles commenting on the importance of Teleki's trip. The semi-official "Italian News" stated that this visit shows the close unity between Italy and Hungary. Although this trip is of a private nature, there is absolutely no reason not to take this opportunity to exchange views with Mussolini and Ciano. This exchange of views, held after the Brenner talks, will have important decisions regarding the situation in Southeastern Europe and the path of German-Italian cooperation. (Haitong report, 20th)</p>
<p>Paris: Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki and Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu are scheduled to visit Rome in the short term. Political figures here are paying close attention after hearing the news and saying that when the dictators of Germany and Italy met at the Brenner Pass yesterday, in addition to discussing the issue of peace, they also reviewed the situation in Southeastern Europe, especially the issues of Romania and Hungary. The visits to Rome by Prime Minister Teleki and Foreign Minister Gafencu are probably related to this. One point to note is that the views of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German leader Hitler are not consistent. Germany's goal is to use inducements and threats to obtain various raw materials from Romania, while Italy has always supported Hungary's demands for treaty revisions, such as the demand for Romania to return the province of Outer Transylvania. Therefore, Italy's efforts in recent years have been aimed at trying to bring Romania and Hungary closer together, which is completely different from Germany's economic and political goals in Southeastern Europe. From this point of view, Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki is going to Rome this time to inquire about the results of the Brenner Pass talks, because it is very important to Hungary what Germany and Italy will do in Southeastern Europe in the future. In short, if Italian Prime Minister Mussolini follows Hitler's point of view, then Hungary will be in a delicate situation. (Havas report, 19th)</p>

<h3>Chamberlain's Wartime Policies Cause Heated Debate in the House of Commons; Pelly Lays Accusation Against Government for Insufficient Aid to Finland; Attlee Attacks Policy of Following the Situation and Waiting; Chamberlain Reiterates Britain's War Aims</h3>
<p>London - British Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons yesterday afternoon that since we bear the responsibility of administration, we cannot rashly make adventurous attempts that seem to have no hope of success and are harmful. Now, some people advocate a strong policy, believing that it is appropriate to adopt an imaginative and courageous strike to seize the initiative. However, we must know that the timing and location of our strikes must depend on the opinions of our most capable experts and take the most reliable path to victory, which is to maintain our determination and unity, so that it does not waver in the slightest. US President Roosevelt has already explained moral peace. The reason why we rise up to fight is to obtain this kind of peace. If we do not obtain it, we will continue to fight. We have like-minded compatriots in the Empire, we have loyal allies with strong military forces outside the Channel, and we have a moral concept, which is what we are fighting for now, that is, to establish the lasting moral peace that the righteous in the world, as President Roosevelt said, want to establish. The Prime Minister mentioned the German air raid on Scapa Flow on Saturday, saying that attacks on our naval bases on the north and east coasts were often expected by us, but we are confident that we have the ability to deal with them. The air raid on land was the first time. One hundred and twenty-one high-explosive bombs and five hundred incendiary bombs fell on an area of ​​one hundred square miles, injuring several civilians, one of whom died. The German High Command has always claimed that it is bombing military targets, but no matter what its intentions, the House of Commons should pay attention to this matter and know that the party that bears the responsibility for the consequences is the party that bombed first. In this tragic struggle, this kind of trivial matter is of course not important. After the Prime Minister finished speaking, there was great applause.</p>
<p>Pelly Accuses Aid to Finland of Being Improper</p>
<p>Former Secretary of War Pelly asked whether the Allied countries had done their best in their essential diplomacy and overall efforts to achieve their goals, and said that at the beginning of the war, there were two lightning strikes: one was the destruction of Poland, and the other was the clearing of German commerce at sea. Since then, Germany has not been very active on land, and the Allied countries have focused on blockade, which is the only effective weapon adopted by the Allied countries to defeat the German side. However, is this sufficient, or must the pressure be increased in other areas? Germany urgently needs iron sand and steel supplies. The reason why Germany promoted the end of the Finnish war lies in this, because if the Soviet Union does not stop the war with Finland for a day, the material benefits that Germany can obtain from the Soviet Union cannot be realized for a day, especially mineral oil. The Finnish affair is the Allied countries. For the sake of the Allied countries, the Allied countries should maintain Finland's resistance. From the perspective of the Supreme Military Council, sending troops to aid Finland is feasible and necessary. However, from this moment on, the actions of the Allied countries should be carried out with resolute measures. It is okay to wait and hesitate when formulating policies, but it should not be like this when implementing policies. According to the facts, the Allied countries have unfortunately allowed their planned initiative to be seized by others. Everyone knows the urgency of troop needs. Three weeks have passed since the Supreme Military Council made this decision. The Allied countries only informed the Finnish government of the departure of troops and armament when the Finnish government had already contacted Moscow. This was done after Finland repeatedly requested it. Is the Norwegian Foreign Minister falsely stating that the Soviet-Finnish peace negotiations have already been conducted, and the Allied countries are making a false request to Norway to send troops? The general situation believes that the air force can use its great power to defeat the Soviet army's attack. Even if there are objections from other parties, it cannot prevent the departure of the British air force. Is it not worth a month's production of British aircraft factories for Britain to preserve the situation? However, Britain and France hesitated, the enemy was lively, and Finland was lost. Today, the influence in various parts of Europe is obvious. Now there is a movement towards a new front. The war may not develop, but Hitler's party members are now running around very busy. May I ask whether the Allied countries can stop the trend of neutral countries joining Germany? The entire war must be won with the entire effort. The German-Soviet alliance once damaged the sympathy of Italy and Japan for Germany. Now, Germany is obviously making great efforts to restore its friendship. If this kind of theory eventually becomes a tool that is unfavorable to the democratic countries, it will be an unfortunate development. Britain and France are the strongest countries in the world. If they want to practice their doctrine and achieve victory, they must not only have the name of being strong, but must also show their strength.</p>
<p>Sinclair Advocates Seizing the Initiative</p>
<p>After Pelly finished speaking, Liberal Party leader Sinclair took the floor, saying that the Allied countries should strive hard to win and must seize the initiative and hold it firmly. Parliament may consider whether it wants to obtain more effective national, imperial, and allied war tools than those available before. The current wartime cabinet, with its existing methods of consultation between the dominions and the Allied countries, is unevenly distributed and not flexible enough, and it does not seem to promote the spirit of serious warfare. From his perspective, Parliament should hold a closed-door meeting to discuss this matter. It is too late to preserve Poland and Finland now, but we should thoroughly deal with this kind of event to prevent our doctrine from being thwarted again. He also agreed with the Prime Minister's remarks regarding the recent battle of Scapa Flow. The current war is not progressing as expected and has been very silent. Therefore, as soon as a cannon sounds anywhere, the people easily regard it as a major event. Britain is now fighting a country with great power and effectiveness, and whether Europe will return to the era of barbaric and hegemonic governments, or whether it will glorify its light based on freedom, justice, and the rule of law, depends on this. The freedom and independence of Poland, Finland, the Baltic Sea, and the Scandinavian peninsula all depend on the Allied victory in the war against Germany.</p>
<p>Attlee Questions Government's Slow Action</p>
<p>Labor Party leader Attlee also stood up to speak, saying that Finland's courageous resistance to aggression is the same ambition as what Britain is fighting for. The responsibility to aid Finland is not only borne by Britain, but also by every member state of the League of Nations. Norway and Sweden do not have strong military equipment in this regard. He does not want to hear unreasonable judgments about the people close to the front line. The scope of assistance that Britain can provide depends on the degree to which Britain can cooperate with Sweden and Norway. Any actions that infringe on the rights of Sweden and Norway will certainly not happen. The Labor Party does not mean that the British government could have safely provided more assistance, but wants to know whether what has been given is timely and without unnecessary delay. He further hopes that Britain's assistance to Finland and its efforts can be a model for other countries. He dares to ask whether Britain is currently exhausting its efforts in diplomatic, military, and economic aspects. The Prime Minister's statement that the Allied countries learned from Finland the lesson that if they want to defeat aggression, they must be united is highly appreciated by him. He hopes that the people of the country are prepared to resist any strikes that Hitler will give, but the policy of sitting still and waiting for strikes is a way to seek death. We must not allow Hitler to gain the initiative. The Allied countries must use their material and human resources in the best possible way.</p>
<p>Attlee mentioned the situation of the domestic coal industry, saying that there are still too many unemployed miners during the war. The transportation system is wasteful and should be improved by utilizing railway, highway, canal, and sea transportation systems. More attention should be paid to this kind of undertaking, and greater use of human resources should be made. Parliament must know that there are still 1.4 million unemployed people in the country.</p>
<p>Chamberlain Responds to Questions from Various Members</p>
<p>Labor Party member Dalton also stood up to express his views. Prime Minister Chamberlain replied to this debate by saying that Dalton was worried that the government had not fully maintained the nation's fighting spirit. We must know that British intelligence is inferior to that of the enemy in all aspects. The statement that although Britain has blockaded Germany, there are still loopholes and supplies are still being transported into Germany is not true, and it is not a way to arouse the courage to win. Dalton does not know the scope of British work and does not understand the small proportion of loopholes to the entire work. In the current war, it is almost impossible to establish a complete blockade from the beginning of the war. Britain is trying to accommodate neutral countries in a way that does not contradict its war objectives, while handling blockade affairs, and the difficulties it faces can be generally seen. Dalton seems to say that if destroying the rights of neutral countries can increase the damage to the enemy, the rights of neutral countries should not be taken into account. We must know that Britain does not hold this view. Britain strives not to overstep the regulations of international law, while Germany is the opposite. It has absolutely canceled the right to appeal to international law to oppose any destruction. Sometimes, when Britain is about to engage in combat with the enemy nearby and is about to hinder the rights of neutral countries, it also takes into account the international law regulations that Britain itself often invokes. As for Dalton's statement that Norway obeyed German warships to destroy its neutrality, the British Navy and Air Force often monitor whether German warships have violated Norwegian territorial waters. If it is confirmed that this has happened, then we will have to enter this territorial sea and pursue them. (Cheers from the crowd.)</p>
<p>The Prime Minister replied to the criticisms regarding the Finnish war, saying that Sinclair's remarks were mostly wrong. The issue of sending volunteer soldiers can never occupy a major part of any assistance that can be given. We know that what the Mannerheim Line needs are trained soldiers. Untrained volunteers cannot show much difference in the trenches compared to those who are not on the battlefield. We did not know that the Finnish situation was deteriorating until shortly before the final collapse. We still heard that the morale of the Finnish army was extremely high and that they were confident that they could defend the Mannerheim Line. It was not until a few days before the final collapse that the Finnish side informed us that the situation was critical. All requests made by Finland were submitted to the chiefs of staff to see if they thought the requests were appropriate in the environment in which Britain was in. If we only consider the things in the minds of the chiefs of staff, then what we should give will definitely not be as much as what we have already given. The cabinet takes responsibility for shipping out the armaments and war materials that we believe can help the Finns support themselves. If someone criticizes the government's measures as being too late, they should know that the departure of the expeditionary force requires various preparations. Soldiers must be specially selected and given equipment that can be used in deep snow. The equipment must be taken from other countries, and transportation must also be arranged. It is not easy to collect many ships in a very short period of time. However, we are still preparing in order. The reason why Finland did not urgently request troops to assist them was not because the number of the expeditionary force was too small or the departure was too late. It was neither hesitation nor wandering. The only reason why the expeditionary force did not move out in the end was that Sweden and Norway refused to allow troops to pass through their territory, so Finland could not send out a request when it was in urgent need of assistance. Regarding the layer that Britain did not help Finland with a large air force, when Finland asked for help with a large number of bombers, Britain could not but comply with the order except by allocating them from the expeditionary air force and the national defense air force. However, it still gave sympathetic consideration. The first bomber was not possible to make preparations for the convenience of the field, personnel replenishment ammunition and repairs, and could immediately be put into combat. We were prepared to supply crew members and several bombers when Finland appealed, but at that time we heard the news that peace talks were in progress. We did not have the certainty that the Soviet-Finnish war would continue, so we were not willing to plan to send out a large number of bombers that we valued, fearing that they would not be able to save the whole of Finland, nor would they be able to return to their home country. Even so, in the last period, we still followed the request of the Finnish minister and dispatched the bombers that we could dispatch. On the one hand, we should fulfill our responsibility to fight and win against our enemies, and on the other hand, we have done our best to help Finland in all the time we have. As for the problem of aircraft production, he is sure that in the next half month, the House of Commons will know that the output has greatly increased. Although the House of Commons expressed different opinions during the debate, this is a superficial matter, and in fact, the aims of the various parties are the same. (Cheers from the crowd) The British Prime Minister said at the end that President Roosevelt's remarks a few days ago on what kind of peace there should be really won my heart. When we had not started the war, I had tried my best to avert the war. Now that we have started the war, I should be equally determined to achieve our war aims. (Reuters telegram on the 20th)</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary's Report on the European Situation</h3>
<p>London - Foreign Secretary Halifax said in the House of Lords last night about the Finnish-Soviet war that what I can guarantee to the Lords is that we will never deviate from the main purpose, which is to defeat Germany. Fortunately, do not overthink that any special actions of ours will be enough to damage British-Soviet relations at any time. I intend to state Britain's policy at today's stage, and its clarity is no more than this belief. Halifax continued to say that he was unable to tell the House of Lords what the situation was at the Brenner Pass Conference. However, no matter what the future holds, we are determined to be prepared to deal with it. He dares to say that those who say that time is not in favor of the British side must be ruffians. Those who dare to say that it is appropriate to take action against action at any cost and disregard the pros and cons are even more foolish. Britain does not want to destroy Germany in order to obtain true peace, or a similar peace. Britain's ambition is to do its best to see the freedom that has been deprived of all nations restored. In short, Britain wants to obtain security for the world. Halifax then mentioned the German air raid on Scapa Flow, saying that according to the information obtained, this was not an intentional attack on civilians, or that the proper consequence of this attack was that the British Air Force would take retaliatory action at an appropriate time. I dare not agree with this statement. (Reuters telegram on the 20th)</p>
<h3>Britain Retaliates Against Germany by Air Raiding the Island of Sylt; Deals a Heavy Blow to the German Air Force Base; One Aircraft Shot Down, the Rest Return Safely to Their Original Defense; Several Bombs Fall by Mistake Within Danish Territory</h3>
<p>London - According to the Ministry of Aviation, the British Air Force's attack on the Hörnum Air Force base on the island of Sylt last night began at 8 pm and lasted for seven hours before it was completed. Although the German side searched with searchlights and fired anti-aircraft guns, only one British aircraft has not yet returned. It is probably missing. The rest have safely returned to their original defense. According to the current information, the extent of the damage to the German side is extremely great. At about 8 o'clock this morning, two more British aircraft flew over the island of Sylt, aiming to take photos to determine the damage caused by the British aircraft during the air raid. According to the latest news from Danzig, hundreds of Danish residents in western Denmark and the island of Rømø witnessed the air raid. Before midnight, they saw an aircraft drop several bombs and then crash on the beach. There was also a bomber that dropped several bombs on the Hindenburgdamm. They saw huge flames and black clouds rising from there. (Reuters telegram on the 20th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The German High Command issued a battle report today stating that several British aircraft attacked the island of Sylt by air at 8 pm last night. Most of the bombs dropped fell into the sea, and only one house was destroyed. A British aircraft was shot down by our anti-aircraft guns. It is reported that the British aircraft flew over the airspace of the Netherlands and Denmark during this attack on the island. (Haitong News Agency telegram on the 20th)</p>
<p>Danzig - It is reported that when the British aircraft attacked Sylt by air, several bombs fell near the Wit place near Linköbing in Danish territory. The nationality of the aircraft involved has not been determined. Several thatched houses in the area were slightly damaged, but no one was injured. Several bomb craters were also found in the Vahlen place near Wustergath, but there was no damage. (Reuters telegram on the 20th)</p>
<p>London - The Ministry of Aviation has just announced the circumstances of the British Air Force's attack on the German Air Force base in Hörnum on the island of Sylt yesterday, causing significant damage. It is said that the area is one of the German aircraft's coastal bases for attacking British naval and merchant ships. Because German aircraft attacked the British coastal base in the Orkney Islands, the British aircraft took this action to retaliate. After British Prime Minister Chamberlain received the news of the attack on Hörnum, he immediately announced it in the House of Commons, saying that this news was based on a wireless message sent by the lead aircraft, and that the attack was still continuing. The Prime Minister called the German aircraft's attack on Scapa Flow "very unimportant" and adjusted that if this attack was an attack by German aircraft on the fleet in Scapa Flow, it must be regarded as a failure. The general public may pay too much attention to the actual situation of the air raid because of the so-called "impeccable communiqué" issued by the German commander. We should not forget the "impeccable communiqué" previously issued by the German side. German aircraft dropped more than 20 bombs in Scapa Flow, and one ship was slightly damaged, but it was not a main battleship. We must always be prepared for attacks on our naval bases and the northeastern part of the country, but we are confident in our ability to deal with German aircraft.

<h3>Crocodiles are Edible; Japanese Regard them as a Delicacy</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Someone recently transported 150 crocodiles to Yokohama. It is reported that their meat is edible. The owner, Kido, also said that these crocodiles are collected in the South Sea Islands. Compared with American crocodiles, their skin is tougher and their meat is more delicious, similar to spring chicken. It can be eaten raw or cooked. Indigenous people in the South Sea Islands sell crocodiles about six feet long, each for 30 yen, but the price in the Japanese market is 300 yen. Once the public clamors for it, the price can continue to rise. According to recent colorful films, there are often crocodiles worshiped as gods, and living people are offered as sacrifices to be swallowed by them. Now the Japanese are doing the opposite. It can be said that they are the most gluttonous. The general public often worries about the high price of meat and the shortage of meat. Now that a large number of crocodiles have been obtained, can they be relieved? (Havas telegram on the 18th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Approves Peace Treaty with Finland; Finland, Sweden, and Norway Alliance; Soviet Union Expresses Opposition</h3>
<p>Moscow - The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union today approved the Soviet-Finnish Peace Treaty signed on March 12, 1940. (TASS telegram on the 10th)</p>
<p>Moscow - Finnish President's representatives Paasikivi and Vuennä arrived here today to exchange documents regarding the approval of the Soviet-Finnish Peace Treaty. Those who welcomed them at the airport included Bakov, Director of the Treaty Department of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, Lisijek, Director of the Department of Baltic States Affairs, and Frangstedtström, Military Attaché Counselor of the Swedish Embassy. (TASS telegram on the 19th)</p>
<p>Moscow - According to foreign reports, Finland, Sweden, and Norway are currently conducting negotiations to conclude a so-called "defensive alliance" with the aim of protecting Finland's borders. It is also said that the Soviet Union has not expressed opposition to this "defensive alliance." TASS has been authorized to declare that this report regarding the Soviet Union's attitude is completely inconsistent with the facts. Judging from the Norwegian President's famous anti-Soviet speech on March 14, we can already clearly understand that this "alliance" is directed against the Soviet Union and directly violates the Soviet-Finnish Peace Treaty signed on March 12, 1940. (TASS telegram on the 20th)</p>
<h3>Japanese-Spanish Commercial Treaty Established</h3>
<p>Paris - The commercial agreement between Japan and Spain, which has been under negotiation, is now agreed upon by both parties. The established agreement is for Spain to export 7 million yuan to Japan, and Japan to export 8 million yuan to Spain. (Allied telegram on the 20th)</p>
<h3>China Purchases Military Supplies from the United States; Valued at 390,000 Gold in the Previous Month</h3>
<p>Washington - The State Department recently announced that the value of US military supplies and aircraft exports in February of this year was a total of 19,500,000 US dollars, of which those shipped to France were valued at 7,181,000 US dollars, those shipped to Britain were valued at 3,562,000 US dollars, those shipped to Finland were valued at 2,027,000 US dollars, and those shipped to China were valued at 706,000 US dollars.

<h3>Japanese Dog Food Approved to be Supplied by the National Treasury; As a Reward for Their Postal Delivery Work</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Civil Politics Party member Kita Reikichi recently proposed in the House of Representatives to kill all dogs and cats in the country to save food. However, because Secretary of War Hata Shunroku opposed it, the case was dismissed. It is reported that dogs in various parts of Hokkaido often undertake the work of delivering mail at night in the snow, and their achievements are very great. In order to reward them, the Ministry of Communications has decided that the dog food there will be supplied by the national treasury. According to the "Daily News," "mail carriers such as Yamagishi have been using dogs to assist in delivering mail in winter for a long time. Some local mail carriers often use dogs to lead the way when they get lost in the heavy snow or encounter obstacles on the journey, or use sleds to load mail, which are dragged by dogs. The dog food for this item has always been supplied by the mail carriers, and the amount consumed is often more than the diet of the mail carriers. Recently, rice and firewood have become expensive, and the mail carriers cannot bear the burden. Postal personnel in various places held meetings to discuss remedial measures, and immediately passed a resolution, requesting the Postal Bureau of the Ministry of Communications to provide subsidies. The authorities of the Ministry of Communications have now drafted regulations, which will give this kind of dog that is responsible for delivering mail the treatment of a mail carrier, and their salary will be paid by the national treasury."

<h3>Focus on Jieyang in the Chao-Shan Battle; Fierce Fighting Continues Along the Chao-Shan Railway Line</h3>
<p>Shantou Dispatch, March 2nd: The highest-ranking Japanese general, Nishio Toju, once flew to Chao-Shan for inspection. Approximately one regiment of newly added Japanese troops also arrived in Chenghai and Chao'an, using the Chao River as the main artery. Their military advance pointed towards Jieyang. Over the past ten days, fierce battles have erupted in three locations: outside Chenghai city, the outskirts of Chao'an, and the Sangpu Mountain range. The battle conditions are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Suburbs of Chenghai</p>
<p>The terrain occupied by the Chinese army in the suburbs of Chenghai is extremely unfavorable, as the area belongs to a flat, low-lying region with intertwined rivers. The Chinese side lacks motorboats for transportation, and advances and retreats are often shrouded in darkness, making it extremely difficult to accomplish tasks during the day. On February 27th, the Chinese army seized Chenghai city and cleared out the Japanese and puppet troops in Nanyang and Donglong. On the 29th, Chinese and Japanese troops confronted each other across the river in Xiapu, Shangpeng, and Ouding. On the 5th of this month, the Japanese army used motorboats to transport over 500 soldiers, coordinating with over 700 Japanese and puppet troops from Waisha to launch a large-scale attack on the east gate of Chenghai. A bloody battle ensued. By 9:00 AM on the 8th, the Japanese suffered over 400 casualties, and 300 puppet troops surrendered to the Chinese side. The Japanese army retreated in disarray to Ouding and Waisha. The river surface there is approximately three miles wide, and the Chinese army did not cross the river to pursue them. After the 8th, clear gun and artillery sounds were again heard in the suburbs of Shantou, indicating that the fighting had shifted to Anbu, Pengzhousuo, and the foot of Sangpu Mountain.</p>
<p>Outskirts of Chao'an</p>
<p>From mid-March to March 7th, the fighting never ceased. On March 1st, the Chinese army had approached the city walls, and those who crossed the river from Waisha attacked the Japanese transportation station outside the south gate's Chuncheng Tower, killing over 50 Japanese soldiers. On the night of the 2nd, the artillery battle at Yixi was extremely fierce. The Chinese plainclothes team attacked to the foot of Jinshan Mountain at the north gate, and another unit crawled into Shuangjing Mountain, breaking through two layers of barbed wire, attacking the Hanwen Gong Ancestral Hall, and hacking over a dozen Japanese soldiers to death before retreating. At Yixi and Zhugao Mountain, both sides engaged in an all-night artillery battle, which only stopped on the morning of the 3rd. At this time, Japanese reinforcements had arrived in the suburbs of Chao'an, replacing the Japanese troops who had been trapped in various strongholds for many days. Also, at 10:00 AM on the 2nd, over 400 Japanese infantry and cavalry opened from Chao'an city to Fuyang, being stationed in Gezhou. When passing through Shaxi, they fought with the Chinese local volunteer corps for three hours. The Chinese volunteers scattered and ambushed from the hillsides on both sides, occupying advantageous positions. The Japanese suffered dozens of casualties and retreated towards Chao'an.</p>
<p>Chao-Shan Railway</p>
<p>The fighting along the railway line started on March [blank]th. Over 3,000 Japanese troops from the Taura unit, using Fuyang as a base, advanced on the front towards Anjie Road, attempting to attack Wu Deze's division of the Chinese army in Jieyang. They used Qingmao Mountain, Fengxi, and Yunti Mountain as positions to shield Jieyang. The base was established in the mountains on the border of Fengjie. When the Taura unit advanced towards Qingmao Mountain, the Chen Regiment of the Chinese army also attacked Yixi and Xitang. Another special operations team attacked the Japanese positions at Bijia Mountain and Tiyun City on the 7th, flanking behind the Japanese troops in Fuyang and Gezhou. When the Taura unit attacked Qingmao Mountain, Japanese naval aircraft flew from overseas to assist in the battle, with several planes bombing Jieyang in the rear of the Chinese army. When passing the fort at Guanbu, they flew low and strafed with machine guns, then circled along the railway line to conduct reconnaissance, indicating artillery firing targets. The Chinese army on Qingmao Mountain resisted strongly and never retreated. The fighting lasted until 4:00 PM, when the Chen Regiment of the Chinese army attacked Tiyun City from two directions, breaking through the Japanese lines in Yunbu Village. The Japanese lines in Fuyang and Gezhou were greatly shaken, and the Taura unit abandoned Qingmao Mountain and retreated towards Chao'an. On the night of the 7th, Chinese guerrillas infiltrated the south gate and engaged in street fighting in the city for three hours. The retreating Japanese troops were intercepted and severely attacked by the Chinese guerrillas, suffering over 200 casualties. The fighting along the Chao-Shan Railway line became increasingly fierce from the 8th. The Japanese army wanted to occupy Jieyang, while the Chinese army wanted to recapture Chao-Shan. The strength of both sides has increased by nearly a full extent compared to last year, so the unfolding of the Lingdong battle situation is more spectacular than before.</p>
<p>Jieyang Port</p>
<p>Hua Zhenzhong's Independent 19th Brigade of the Chinese army steadfastly defended Sangpu Mountain, where the three counties of Jieyang, Chao'an, and Chenghai meet. It is approximately 30 li from Shantou city, and can overlook Shantou city, controlling the Chao-Shan Railway and the Rongjiang River navigation. For half a year, the Japanese army has been unable to break into the mountains. On March 1st, reinforcements from the mainland arrived at Anbu. On the morning of the 8th, in response to the Japanese army in Chao'an, they advanced towards Jiaoshan County and Pannan Mountain at the foot of Sangpu Mountain. Pengzhousuo, on the west side of Sangpu Mountain, had been occupied by the Japanese army, and fortifications had been built to block the mountain. Also, on the 5th, a Japanese shallow-water vessel sailed into Jieyang Port and stopped in front of Guanbu, attempting to send troops ashore. The Chinese army and civilians on the shore were already on high alert. On the 6th, three Japanese armed motorboats sailed two li northeast of Guanbu, scouting landing sites and attempting to bombard Fort City. Huang Guojun's brigade, stationed there, immediately announced the closure of the river surface, cutting off ferry traffic. On the morning of the 7th, thirty-six armed motorboats from the Japanese army in Shantou, fully loaded with Japanese ground troops, sailed into Jieyang Port, initially docking at the coasts of Nanaokou and Pengzhousuo. At 2:00 PM that afternoon, a squadron of Chinese air force suddenly appeared in the sky above Shantou city. Two Japanese military trains, carrying 500 soldiers, drove to Anbu Station and were immediately struck by over a dozen bombs dropped by the Chinese air force, most of which hit, causing over 100 Japanese casualties. The Japanese artillery fort at Pengzhousuo was also hit by eighteen bombs, destroying three. The Chinese planes also covered the Sangpu Mountain, repelling the Japanese army. The Japanese motorboat squadron that attacked Fort City from Nanxi was also strafed by the Chinese air force and driven back. On the 8th and 9th, the fighting gradually shifted to the Fengkou, Quxi, and Fort areas of Jieyang, with extremely fierce artillery battles.</p>
<h3>Last Year's Overseas Chinese Remittances from Fujian Set New Records; About 40 Million Yuan Before the War; Last Year, Quanzhou Alone Exceeded 100 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: The foreign trade of Zhangzhou and Quanzhou in southern Fujian has historically suffered from a significant trade deficit, amounting to approximately 40 million yuan annually. This deficit has been offset by remittances from overseas Chinese. Since the start of the War of Resistance, remittances from overseas Chinese have been extremely enthusiastic. Last year, in particular, surpassed all previous records, exceeding the normal annual amount threefold, marking the peak of overseas Chinese remittances in southern Fujian. According to statistics from the former Xiamen Silver and Letter Industry Association, the highest record in 1937 was over 60 million yuan, covering Xiamen, Gulangyu, and the counties of Zhangzhou and Quanzhou. According to a report from the Quanzhou Silver and Letter Industry Association, remittances from Quanzhou alone last year (end of the lunar year) should have been over 100 million yuan, with Jinjiang County accounting for approximately half, exceeding 50 million yuan. Nan'an County accounted for over [blank]15 million yuan, and the remaining quarter, 25 million yuan, was divided between Huian, Tong'an, Anxi, Dehua, and [blank] County, with Yongchun accounting for a strong tenth, approximately over 10 million yuan. An investigation revealed that Quanzhou has a total of 26 silver and letter agencies. Last year, the agency that distributed the most remittances and drafts reached over [blank]16 million yuan, while others had over 10 million, several million, several hundred thousand, and at least several tens of thousands of yuan. An investigation revealed that since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, many middle-class and upper-class families of overseas Chinese from Quanzhou have evacuated to Southeast Asia. Otherwise, the number of overseas remittances last year would have been even higher. It is estimated that it could have increased by one-third to half. In recent years, state-owned banks have absorbed a huge amount of foreign exchange in Southeast Asia. Overseas Chinese have been competing to purchase legal tender with their surplus funds and deposit them in state-owned banks, with amounts ranging from millions to thousands of yuan. Even a poor elementary school teacher could save 3,000 to 4,000 yuan in legal tender per year. The foreign currency absorbed by the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Overseas Chinese Bank in British, Dutch, American, and French territories in Southeast Asia has exceeded previous years many times over. The Bank of China plans to continue to establish branches in the Philippines. The Philippine branch of the Bank of Communications has been serving overseas Chinese in recent years and has gained a good reputation, with its business greatly expanding. Furthermore, various parts of southern Fujian have been greatly affected by the surge in overseas remittances, and local financial resources have become unusually active, with an apparent abundance of cash. Families of overseas Chinese are using this to compete to purchase farmland and build mansions, causing land prices to increase tenfold and creating a shortage of building materials.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese from various native places residing in Southeast Asia, in view of the fact that the great undertaking of national reconstruction depends on the development of resources and that the revitalization of industry depends even more on the economic strength of overseas Chinese, have jointly organized the Fujian Industrial Co., Ltd. The business term is set at 20 years, with the general company established in the provincial capital. The total capital is set at 1 million national currency units, divided into 10,000 shares, each worth 100 yuan, to be paid in two installments. The shares will be subscribed by overseas Chinese from Fujian. The business will focus on agricultural production, supplemented by industrial production. The business area will cover the entire province. The business includes: (A) operating multifunctional farms to increase national resources; (B) opening new-style factories to manufacture daily necessities to meet social needs; (C) establishing model stores to supply public consumption; (D) operating government-approved public utilities and other industries. A preparatory office has been established and personnel have been dispatched back to Fujian to liaise.</p>
<h3>Mayor of Dinghai, Chen Ji'an, Assassinated; Chen's Wife Also Injured and Suffered Serious Harm</h3>
<p>Dinghai Dispatch: Chen Ji'an, the mayor of the pseudo-special city, previously served as the town mayor of Chengzhen and the chief of the voluntary model corps. However, after the fall of Dingcheng, Chen defected and surrendered to the Japanese, serving as the president of the pseudo-Dinghai County Self-Government Association. But not long after, due to unequal distribution of spoils, he was detained by the Japanese army and demoted to mayor of the pseudo-Chengwei Special City. Chen remained unrepentant and even used his power to exploit the local people, causing resentment among the residents. One night in early this month, after Chen and his wife finished playing cards at the home of Jin A'man, they were about to return to their residence in front of the park when, unexpectedly, as they passed the Zhenfu Alley entrance of the Qian Clan Ancestral Hall, two strong men wielding sharp blades suddenly leaped out from the darkness and slashed at Chen's head and throat. Although Chen was strong, he was over sixty years old and unprepared, so he was seriously wounded and fell to the ground. Chen's wife cried out for help, but the strong men, fearing they would be heard, also slashed Chen's wife in the face and mouth with their sharp blades. It was said that several cuts were made to her cheek, and the flesh was torn. She was seriously injured. Afterwards, neighbors sent Chen and his wife to the hospital for treatment, but because the injuries were in vital areas, their lives were in grave danger.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Province Promotes New County System; Expected to be Completed Within Three Years</h3>
<p>Chengdu Dispatch: Sichuan Province began implementing the new county system on March 1st, and progress has been quite smooth. The provincial government has now submitted a report on the implementation situation to the central government. From the 1st, the province and counties will receive and spend funds according to the newly established standards. The adjustments of the various sections of the county governments are being rushed through, and all [blank] matters will be completed by the end of the month. The first phase of training for cadres and administrative personnel from each county will be for the county government secretaries and half of the district chiefs. The provincial government has now ordered all those to be trained to report to the province by April 15th. Classes will officially begin in late April.</p>
<p>The implementation of the new county system is scheduled to be completed within three years. In terms of new institutions, the 135 counties in Sichuan will be divided into six levels according to their area, population, economic, and cultural conditions. The civil affairs, finance, and military sections will all be uniformly established in the county governments. As for the current district offices, except for those in remote counties with inconvenient transportation, such as Leima, Ping'e, Songli, Maomao, and other counties, which will all be retained, the rest will be considered for abolition. The district chiefs who are abolished will be resettled as much as possible. After deliberation and decision by the provincial affairs meeting, the methods will be to either transfer them to county instructors or section chiefs, or to participate in examinations. The organization and personnel of the townships and paochia are also clearly regulated.</p>
<p>Regarding financial allocation, from the date of implementation of the new county system, all of the original provincial slaughter tax and house tax, 30% of the total amount of central government subsidies for stamp tax, and a portion of the excess provincial land tax after the completion of land reporting will be allocated to the counties. Furthermore, county judicial expenses, district joint school expenses, district standards and measures inspection branch expenses, county education guidance director and cooperation instructor expenses have all been changed to be borne by the provincial treasury. The expenses of each squad of the National Guard will be allocated by the Ministry of Military Affairs. For increased funding, legal new taxes can be levied, such as business license tax.</p>
<p>Regarding education and training matters, on the one hand, the Department of Education will formulate plans to establish township and town central elementary schools according to regulations, and complete the national elementary schools within three years to popularize people's education. At the same time, normal schools will be used to cultivate local administrative cadre talents. On the other hand, a county personnel selection committee will be specially established to select talents, and a county local cadre training committee and training group will be established to separately mobilize current personnel and recruit some young people to undergo short-term training before being appointed. In addition, the organization of national guard groups, the establishment of various levels of public opinion organs, the development of the economy, and the implementation of autonomy will all be gradually implemented in accordance with central government regulations.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Forcibly Seized the Xishan Coal Mine in Suzhou; It is Said that They Will Hire Workers to Mine It</h3>
<p>Suzhou Dispatch: Dongzhai River Town in the Xishan Mountain of the county's jurisdiction is surrounded by mountains on three sides, and the mountains extend for dozens of miles. They all contain deposits of smokeless coal. In 1930, Gan Tang of Luowan Town, Xishan, initiated fundraising to submit a request to the provincial government and the Ministry of Industry to develop the mine. However, due to a shortage of capital, they were unable to purchase new-style machinery and only used old methods for mining. Therefore, the daily output was very low. After the war, due to transportation problems, the work was suspended. Recently, the Japanese Huazhong Electric Company, after seizing major Chinese factories, needs a large amount of fuel, so they coveted the coal mine there. On the 15th of this month, Okada, the head of the Japanese special agency, suddenly sent over 20 Japanese and puppet personnel to the town of Xishan to forcibly take over the mine. It is said that they will hire Chinese workers to mine it in the near future.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants Absorb Large Quantities of Rice in Wuxi; Pseudo Troops Arrest Xue Mansheng</h3>
<p>Wuxi Dispatch: The price of rice in Wuxi has fluctuated greatly recently. Market prices in the neighboring counties of Wuyi, Suyu, and other counties have also tended to fall. Currently, the market price of high-quality white rice is around 27 yuan per stone, but Japanese merchants are still absorbing large quantities. They also sold 20,000 stones of white rice to rice milling businesses at a price of 27 and a half yuan, causing the rice price to rise back by five or six jiao. According to the current amount of rice in storage, it is unlikely to rise again. If the source continues to flow, the market price can be expected to fall. However, if Japanese merchants continue to order large quantities, the market will be greatly affected. There is no proper way to ensure that people have enough food. Xue Mansheng, a resident of Wuxi, once held a special position for the Japanese at the beginning of the occupation and was very influential. He then avoided Shanghai for a time. This spring, he returned to Wuxi for his mother's birthday. Unexpectedly, Cheng Wanjun, the leader of the pseudo-pacification troops, learned that Xue was in contact with Commander Gu's guerrilla unit and ordered his arrest. Xue knew that he would be unable to escape. [blank] Still trusted by the Japanese, he went to Hankou to temporarily avoid the danger.</p>

<h3>Competition Subjects and Reward Methods for Schools Above Junior College Level; Ministry of Education Announces 12 Regulations</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airlines Dispatch) Improving the quality of schools above junior college level is extremely important. The Ministry of Education has paid close attention to this issue in recent years. Measures such as curriculum arrangement, department adjustment, equipment enrichment, academic research promotion, and unified enrollment have all yielded results. The Sixth Plenary Session's resolution on education also indicated that future university education should emphasize quality improvement. The Ministry of Education believes that although various examinations for schools above junior college level have been strictly enforced in recent years, there has been little competitive observation of academic achievements. In order to encourage student academic research, the Ministry of Education has specially formulated the National School Above Junior College Student Academic Competition Method and promulgated it for implementation. Regarding the date of the competition, the subjects of the Class B competition for each grade, and the reward methods, it is said that a public announcement will be made after a decision is made. The following is a record of the competition method:</p>
<p>National School Above Junior College Student Academic Competition Method</p>
<p>Article 1: The Ministry of Education has specially formulated this method to encourage student academic research in schools above junior college level. Article 2: Academic competitions are divided into three types: A, B, and C. Type A competitions include three subjects: Chinese, English (French or German), and Mathematics. First-year students from all colleges and universities may freely apply to take one to three subjects. Type B competitions include major subjects in each department. Second- and third-year students from all colleges and universities may freely apply to take the subjects designated for each grade. Type C competitions are for graduation theses. Fourth-year students from all colleges and universities must participate. Article 3: Type A and B competitions are divided into a preliminary test and a retest, each held once a year. The preliminary test is conducted by each college and university, and the retest is conducted by the Ministry of Education. Type C is divided into a preliminary selection and a re-selection. The preliminary selection is conducted by each college and university, and the re-selection is conducted by the Ministry of Education. Article 4: Students who are selected for the preliminary test or preliminary selection are called preliminary selected students. For Type A, the unit is the college (for junior colleges, the unit is the school). For each college (school), if there are fewer than 80 students taking the test, one student with the best score in each subject will be selected as a preliminary selected student. If there are more than 80 students, one additional student will be added for each subject. For Type B, the unit is the grade. For each department, if there are more than five students in each grade, one student with the best score will be selected as a preliminary selected student. If there are fewer than five students in each grade, they should be combined with other grades in the same department for selection. For Type C, the unit is the department. One student with the best graduation thesis in each department for the current year will be selected as a preliminary selected student. Article 5: Each college and university's preliminary test and preliminary selection should be handled by an academic competition committee, with the college and university president, dean of academic affairs, and department heads serving as members, with the college and university president serving as the chairman of the committee. Article 6: Each college and university's academic competition committee may hire professors of relevant subjects as examination committee members to handle the matters of setting questions, grading papers, and reviewing theses.

<h3>The Ministry of Education Announces the Revised Teaching Hours Table for Junior and Senior High Schools (1); Also Promulgates the Method for Adding Teacher Training Subjects in Junior High School</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airlines Dispatch) The Ministry of Education is now actively revising the curriculum standards for junior and senior high schools. In addition to announcing the revised teaching hours and weekly teaching hours table for each subject in junior and senior high schools on February 14th, and in view of the imminent implementation of national education, although provinces are establishing normal schools, simplified normal schools, special normal departments, and simplified normal departments in various normal school districts, the lack of national education teachers in each county is extremely severe. When there is no formal teacher training institution in the local area, the provincial education administrative organs have no choice but to temporarily designate public junior high schools, or the county government submits a request for approval, allowing the third grade of the county junior high school to add teacher training subjects to cultivate national school substitute teachers to remedy the situation. When the local teacher supply is sufficient and formal teacher training institutions have been established, the training subjects will be discontinued. The Ministry of Education has notified the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities to comply with this method. The training subject method and the revised teaching hours table for junior and senior high schools are recorded below separately:</p>
<p>(1) Method for Adding Teacher Training Subjects in the Third Grade of Junior High Schools</p>
<p>(1) Any third-grade junior high school student who is over 17 years old and whose average academic performance in the previous year is above 70 points and who is willing to serve as a national school teacher may choose to study teacher training subjects. (2) The teacher training subjects and weekly teaching hours for the third grade of junior high schools are as follows: First semester: Teaching outline 2 hours per week, teaching method 4 hours (including child psychology and teaching materials); Second semester: School administration 2 hours per week (including child care law), teaching practice 4 hours. (3) The teaching hours of the required junior high school subjects for students who choose to study teacher training subjects must not be reduced. The number of mathematics hours for teacher training subjects is three hours of the original elective hours in the third grade, plus an additional three hours, totaling six hours. The total weekly teaching hours is three hours more than other students. (4) Students who choose to study teacher training subjects may serve as substitute teachers in national schools after graduation and must serve for more than one year and receive training in teacher refresher courses for more than six months or participate in summer seminars for more than three sessions before they can obtain the same qualifications as graduates of simplified normal schools or simplified normal departments. These graduates may apply for simplified normal departments or normal schools. (5) Municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan may follow this method.</p>

(5) The research association mentioned in the previous article should, based on the teaching principles stipulated in Article 3, compile a Three People's Principles teaching outline, which, after being approved by the supervisor, will serve as the standard for the Three People's Principles curriculum. The research should also be divided into groups, and teaching materials should be compiled according to this standard. The research association should also collect lecture materials and regularly distribute them to Party Principles teachers for their use in teaching. (6) The professors of the Three People's Principles curriculum in each school will be selected by the Ministry of Education from the members of the research association mentioned in Article 4 and assigned to the respective colleges and universities for appointment.

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Finance: The Psychology of Expecting Depreciation in US-British Exchange Rates Has Not Diminished</h3>
<p>The exchange rate situation yesterday showed no changes in the HSBC listed prices. The black market for British and American exchange rates remained weak. The only news that could affect the market was the clarification of the war situation in Europe. It was predicted yesterday that the US-British exchange rate might fall again, and the weakening of the exchange market did indeed start with a drop of 2.375 points in the early morning. Therefore, the US dollar was tighter than the British pound after the opening. Although the Japan Bank and the Hong Kong Electric Company made some sales, causing a rebound in the middle, news suddenly came from foreign telegrams that the British Prime Minister's confidence in European peace was very weak and that the policy of fighting to the end had not changed. As a result, Chinese merchants rushed to buy US dollar futures without hesitation. As a result, both British and American exchange rates showed slight tightness, and the psychology of expecting depreciation in exchange rates continued to prevail.</p>
<p>The Buying Wind for the US Dollar Has Not Declined</p>
<p>In the early morning, the large London bill was flat for both near and far terms. The New York silver price was also flat, and the London raw gold was stagnant. The exchange rate of British pound against US, Shanghai, and French currencies was flat. The US dollar depreciated by 2.375 points against the British pound, remained unchanged against the Shanghai currency, and depreciated slightly by 1.125 points against the French currency. The listed prices of various currencies at the Central Bank remained the same. The bank's opening spot prices in the morning were British gold at 4 shillings and 1.125 pence, and the US dollar at 6.4375 yuan, which was tighter than the British pound compared to the previous closing. It was calculated that the British pound depreciated by 0.015625, and the US dollar weakened by 0.0625, which was due to the depreciation of the exchange rate. After the opening, the Japan Bank first made some sales, followed by the Hong Kong Electric Company. The market suddenly saw a rebound. It was calculated that the Japan Bank sold spot US dollars to Youli at 6.46875 yuan, and the Hong Kong Electric Company sold spot British gold to foreign banks at 4 shillings and 4.0625 pence. The HSBC listed prices were announced to be unchanged. The balance tax on silver was also unchanged. Afterwards, Chinese merchants, upon hearing a telegram that British Prime Minister Chamberlain's attitude was strong and that he declared he would never make peace halfway and would fight to the end, continued to expect a slight decrease in the value of the US-British exchange rates and came to buy US dollar futures again, causing the market to become tight again. It was calculated that speculators closed out this month's US dollar at 6.40625 yuan and next month's US dollar at 6.3125 and 28125 yuan with a certain bank. At the same time, a certain bank also sold this month's US dollar to the same bank at 6.40625 yuan. At that time, the spot US dollar also became tight again, reaching 6.4375 yuan. The spot British gold also shrunk to 4 shillings and 1.125 pence again. Afterwards, fewer buyers appeared, and the situation gradually stabilized. At noon, Shanghai Bank sold next month's US dollar to foreign banks at 6.28125 yuan, which had no impact. Until the close of the market, British gold remained at 4 shillings and 1.125 pence, the US dollar at 6.4375 yuan, this month's British gold at 4 shillings and 1.09375 pence, the US dollar at 6.40625 yuan, next month's British gold at 4 shillings and 0.046875 pence, and the US dollar at 6.28125 yuan. As a result, the spot British pound was tighter by 0.015625 and the US dollar was softer by 0.0625 compared to the previous day. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Hong Kong: British Currency Flat, US Dollar Tight</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 20th (Wednesday) Telegram: The exchange market opened steadily this morning. The British exchange rate was flat for both spot and futures. The spot US dollar was tight at 0.0625, at 23.1875 yuan. The forward rate depreciated by 0.125, at 23 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by 0.5 yuan, at 358 yuan. The Japanese exchange rate was tight by 0.5 yuan, at 98.5 yuan. At 10:00 AM, the market was still stable. The spot US dollar continued to tighten by 0.0625, at 23.125 yuan. The forward rate remained at the original level of 23 yuan. At 11:30 AM, the market was flat, with no changes in any exchange rates. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Tianjin: British and US Currencies Both Increased</p>
<p>Tianjin, 20th (Wednesday) Telegram: The exchange market opened steadily this morning. The spot British exchange rate loosened by 0.0625, at 3 shillings and 9.0625 pence. The spot US dollar increased by 0.09375, at 6.125 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate fell by 1.25 yuan, at 105.75 yuan. The black market for "Lianchao" was cheap by 0.5 yuan, at 101.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>British and American Gold Pounds Gained the Most; American Notes Were Second</h3>
<p>The foreign currency market yesterday suddenly trended upwards again. The price of the British pound did indeed weaken again, and the black market for the US dollar became tight again. In addition, it was widely rumored that a fake "Central Political Conference" had already been held in Nanjing, causing speculators to flock to buy American notes and gold, which skyrocketed. The British and American gold pounds soared particularly fiercely. Only the supply of Hong Kong notes was relatively smooth, and the market was weak. The surge in the price of Japanese gold notes did not subside, reaching 1.33 yuan in the evening market. The demand for Korean notes increased slightly, reaching 0.99 yuan in the evening market. Yesterday's market prices saw the greatest increase in British and American gold pounds, each rising by 1.5 yuan. American gold notes followed, rising by 0.32 yuan. British gold notes also rose by 0.1 yuan. French francs rose by 0.02 yuan, Robbie notes rose by 0.05 yuan, and Philippine notes rose by 0.1 yuan. Only Hong Kong notes fell by 0.05 yuan, while the rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>The Atmosphere of Peace in Europe Dissipated; The Surge in Gold Prices Rose Again; Re-emerged Beyond the 5,100 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>The cash gold bar black market situation yesterday continued to enter an excited state, opening at a low of 5,040 yuan and rising directly to a high of 5,117 yuan. The reasons for this were many favorable factors, such as Von Hoegen's speech, which at least stimulated people's hearts, the fading hope of peace in Europe, and the reported depreciation of British and American exchange rates, which all led to more buying than selling among operators. A large increase in holdings by a certain securities firm had the greatest impact. The buying by the silver firms on behalf of their own firms was also considerable. It was also heard that Hong Kong firms were still active. However, since there was no market this afternoon due to settlement, and the four-day holiday starting tomorrow and the day after would likely reduce the activities of general buyers, it was feared that yesterday's surge would be difficult to continue today.</p>
<p>Gold Bars Rose by 77 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the early morning, the exchange market reported tightness for each gold bar (ten taels), and the atmosphere was quite good. A certain silver firm and securities firm were particularly eager to buy, and the opening price was raised by 12 yuan. The silver firms traded 50 taels with each other at 5,040 yuan. Later, there were few sellers, only a certain money exchange slightly sold out, so the price was raised again by 28 yuan. The securities firm entered 50 taels with the silver firm at 5,068 yuan. After this, the foreign exchange suddenly reported a rebound, and the selling pressure was slightly stronger. The money exchange and the silver building firms sold out one after another, and the price once fell by 14 yuan. The securities firm sold 10 taels to the silver firm at 5,054 yuan. Then, the securities firm and a certain silver firm's desire to buy reappeared, and at the same time, a certain money exchange also competed to buy, and at that time, the foreign exchange recovered, increasing by 44 yuan. The silver firms traded 30 taels with each other at 5,098 yuan. At that time, there were many sellers at the price limit of 5,100 yuan, which slightly reduced the buying pressure, and a certain money exchange re-sold after making a profit. The cash silver firm also took advantage of the high price to sell out, so the price fell by 10 yuan. The money exchange sold 50 taels to the gold firm at 5,088 yuan. Gu Yi, a certain securities firm, came to buy again, and the price rose again by 7 yuan. The securities firm entered 30 taels with the silver firm at 5,095 yuan. Near the close of the market, the gold firm suddenly sold out, so the price fell slightly by 3 yuan. The gold firm sold 50 taels to the silver firm at 5,092 yuan as the closing price for the noon market. The market situation was even stronger in the afternoon. The opening price was high by 8 yuan. The securities firm entered 50 taels with the gold firm at 5,100 yuan. Later, the securities firm and the silver firm bought in again and again, but the sellers were unwilling to let go easily, seeing the situation and raising the price quite a bit. So, in a scarce transaction, the price rose again by 17 yuan. The silver firm entered 50 taels with the cash silver firm at 5,117 yuan. After entering, the buyers stopped their activities, and the general retail sellers took advantage of the high price to sell out. The silver building firms also had sales, so the price fell by 12 yuan. The silver firms traded 50 taels with each other at 5,105 yuan as the closing price for the evening market. As a result, the price rose sharply by 77 yuan compared to the previous day, with fluctuations of 77 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the original gold brand of the cash silver firm was several yuan higher than the price of gold bars, and the buying price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current margin gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Was Listed 5 Yuan Higher</p>
<p>At the beginning, the Datong Bank still suspended the sale of jewelry gold at 510 yuan per tael, but at 10:45, the price was raised by 5 yuan. After that, there were no changes. As a result, Datong Bank changed the suspension price to 515 yuan. The new banks had the same price as the above price, with the buying price reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Hoarders of Yellow Soybeans Rise Again; Prices Recover to About One Yuan</h3>
<p>The market situation in the miscellaneous grains and oil soybeans market yesterday had quite a few waves throughout the day. As a result of the ups and downs, there was a big drop and a small recovery. According to the attitude at the time of closing, because the transactions were mostly cap-style hoarding, the overall situation was not optimistic. The soybean market had been falling for a week, and people's hearts could not help but move. Taking advantage of the opportunity of the oil market turning around yesterday, hoarders came to buy again, and prices turned up by 0.4 to 0.5 yuan to about 1 yuan. There were six cars of Bengbu beans, the price details are in the market price column. Five cars of Wuhu beans, more than 130 packages of Nanjing beans, 200 packages of Anqing beans, 350 packages of Yangzhou Mountain Yellow beans, and 60 packages of Chongming Sand Yellow beans. Today, 610 packages of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Food: There is Accumulation of Cheap Rice Again; Those Hoarding Foreign Rice Have Been Hit</h3>
<p>Since the rice market has abundant inventory, each warehouse took the opportunity to increase rents. For example, Roosevelt and other warehouses changed to two periods a month, resulting in an additional problem of warehouse rent. Moreover, a large number of this month's futures foreign rice arrived one after another, and the silver was heavy. Under the pressure of the environment, the general cargo owners had to sell at a loss, and the market price fell by as much as 14 to 15 yuan, all breaking the 40 yuan mark. High-quality Saigon No. 1 was sold for only 37 to 38 yuan, and low-quality small twist and other tips were only 34 to 35 yuan, while mixed broken grades were already 28 to 29 yuan. Moreover, most of these spot goods were from early spring and the previous year, and the cost was quite high. Not to mention that no one made a profit, there were few who even kept their capital. Hoarders suffered this blow, which was what they deserved, and it was not a pity, because the public had already suffered a lot. In the early morning yesterday, some floating hoarders still sold out, and each price fell by nearly 1 yuan. For example, small twist once fell to 34 yuan, but the original regular merchants no longer sold lightly and started manipulating again, taking advantage of the low price to buy in. For a time, the chips on the market were suddenly scarce, and the feedback was insufficient. As a result, the morning market decline was restored, increasing by about 0.5 yuan compared to the previous market. It was calculated that the closing price of Saigon No. 1 was 39 yuan, No. 2 was 35.5 yuan, fire twist was 36.8 yuan, small twist was 25.5 yuan, Siam No. 2 was 35.5 yuan, Tokyo broken tip was 35 yuan, and mixed broken was 31.5 yuan. Due to the sudden influx of sources of glutinous rice, no less than 2,000 packages arrived yesterday. Moreover, the price of other goods fell sharply again, and the market price was cut by about 1 yuan. More than a dozen types of domestic rice, such as thick and thin japonica and early and late rice, arrived in Nanhong from the river yesterday. There were also many truckloads transferred from Hongkou, no less than 3,000 packages. In this environment, the general cargo owners, seeing that foreign rice was only selling for more than 30 yuan, lacked the purpose of defending the special price and sought to sell early. Moreover, as the weather gradually warmed, goods with weaker bodies were most prone to change, so there were quite a few who sampled in the market. Limited offers were made for early and late rice at 40 yuan, 39.5 yuan, and 39.3 yuan, and the market price for inferior goods was only 36 to 37 yuan. As for high-quality thick and thin japonica rice, there was no product on the regular market and it was still in the off-market black market. It was said that Teshi japonica was 45 yuan, the market price was 43 to 44 yuan, Kunt japonica was 44 yuan, the market price was 42 to 43 yuan, Qingsi special thin was 42 to 43 yuan, and special early rice was 41 to 42 yuan.</p>
<p>The Xiaomi Market Management Committee's Public Office Xiaoguanghan Xiaomi Market will be closed for two days on the 23rd and 24th of this month in the national calendar for the Tomb Sweeping Festival, and will resume normal business on the 25th.</p>
<p>The opening price of foreign rice in the original package continued to decline yesterday morning, and the spot price continued to fall by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. However, the cargo side believed that the cost was high and the losses were too great, and the current pricing differed from the Shanghai repurchase price by 4 yuan, so most of them refused to sell. Saigon No. 2 once opened at 43.2 yuan in the morning, but rose to 44 to 45 yuan in the afternoon. The small twist also shouted around 43 yuan in the morning without a compromise, and also rose to 44 to 45 yuan in the afternoon. I Saigon No. 1 initially called 48.7 yuan, but the cargo side added the code and did not compromise.</p>
<p>More than 22,000 bags of foreign rice have arrived again, which is Fram (transliteration) ship of the Jiecheng Foreign Company, transported from Siam, and arrived in Shanghai at 6:50 pm the day before yesterday (18th), docked at Qichang Warehouse in Pudong for unloading, (Zu).</p>
<h3>The Flour Market is Quiet; Wheat Prices are Stable</h3>
<p>Flour: Although the factory side planned to fix the price of the No. 2 factory plate yesterday at 13.8 yuan and changed the door sales of each number to 14 yuan per bag, the authorities are still considering the sale at a discount, so the official market price is still waiting to be announced today and tomorrow. Yesterday, the sale of discounted flour has been temporarily stopped, and those in need on this street can purchase wholesale from the factory, which has been mostly restored. However, the guest sales are still lonely, and each factory has not yet responded to guest sales, so the market is quiet. It is heard that the returned goods of the old brand are weak again, and the price in the morning was only 13.9 yuan, and the price in the latter market was 13.95 yuan. Other brands generally lacked formal transactions. It is also heard that the noodles industry requires the suppression of the discounted flour price to 12 yuan, so it is necessary to negotiate with the factory again before it can be announced.</p>
<p>Wheat: The market continued to remain flat yesterday. The cargo owners believed that the source of domestic wheat was depleted and the bottom was thin, and although foreign wheat was transported, the new orders were difficult to combine, so the intention to sell was tight. However, the factory side chose cleverness, which led to a holding state on both sides. It is heard that Fufeng Factory slightly handled 300 packages, and the price was still 23.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn Cotton: Foreign Exchange Turned Up; Yarn Market Revived; April Term Double Horse Yarn Sold for 979 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had fallen sharply the previous day, rebounded again yesterday. In fact, the foreign exchange rate turned up and the price of gold soared, which made people feel good. Many parties were active and the market price rose. However, the general short side believed that the overseas Indian and American cotton markets were depressed and the purchase of Indian cotton was even cheaper, so the April term shorting thoughts were particularly urgent. However, the multi-party took advantage of the tight exchange rate to purchase vigorously. The key to the future of the yarn market is still in the exchange market. The April term started at 964 yuan, and the closing price was 979 yuan.</p>
<p>Because the foreign exchange rate changed in the morning and the popularity of the market was revived, the opening price for the 20-count Double Horse March term was 952 yuan. At this time, buyers were slightly enthusiastic, and the price rose to 956 yuan. After the price was high, the short side activities returned and fell to 951 yuan. After 11:00, it was heard that the US exchange rate was very weak and the gold price rose again, and the buying enthusiasm was strong, and the price rose to 957 yuan. The half-day turnover statistics were 2,120 packages, and the spot price of 20-count Double Horse rose by 11 yuan. Today, 300 pieces of yarn were shipped to Haiphong and 100 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount of purchases from each gangkou is listed on the left,</p>

<h3>Pre-Holiday Cotton Market: Increasingly Dull</h3>
<p>Cotton trading has turned dull, with only American cotton business being relatively active, and all transactions are handled by agents from Qingdao. As for the factories, only the Japanese-owned Tongxing mill bought 100 bales, with payment due at the end of April for delivery to the factory. Other factories have not shown any signs of activity. Indian cotton has recently been purchased at very cheap prices. The current spot cotton transactions are listed below:</p>
<p>Middling: 267.50, traded 300 bales among dealers</p>
<p>Also: 267.00, also 200 bales</p>
<p>African: 23.00, also 273 bales</p>
<p>Middling: 260.50, also 100 bales</p>
<p>General Packing: 201.00, also 100 bales</p>
<p>Changshu Cotton: 208.00, also 335 bales</p>
<p>Middling: 275.00, traded 100 bales among dealers at the time</p>
<p>Another report: Regarding foreign cotton market prices, the New York cotton market initially fell yesterday morning due to selling by foreign merchants, but then rebounded slightly due to purchases from New Orleans futures traders and Wall Street. As a result, closing prices for near-term contracts remained unchanged, while prices for deferred contracts rose by 2 to 4 points. Indian cotton fell by more than 3 rupees yesterday and is expected to rebound. Egyptian cotton fell by more than 10 points.</p>
<p>Transactions in foreign cotton in Shanghai have been very quiet recently, with no transactions reported from any party. The Indian cotton market is unable to rally, and with Easter approaching, factories are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Furthermore, there are many arrivals daily, so trading is unusually quiet. The following are the factory delivery prices for yesterday's cotton market, converted at an exchange rate of 6.4375 yuan per U.S. dollar:</p>
<p>20 count: U.S. Middling 260.80</p>
<p>Also: Lower grade 250.90</p>
<p>32 count: Also 285.60</p>
<p>Also: Lower grade 276.00</p>
<p>42 count: Also 289.20</p>
<p>Also: Lower grade 280.00</p>
<h3>Securities: More Domestic Debt Floats, Foreign Stocks Remain Strong</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter securities market yesterday saw a decline due to unfavorable news and the upcoming four-day holiday. Many investors were unwilling to risk accruing unnecessary interest and chose to close out positions. The Nanjing performance became increasingly blatant, and there were too many concerns about futures trading, making it difficult to materialize. There were many floating positions coming out of the market. Category C shares retreated again from 9 yuan, and the situation softened again. The formal market will have to wait until after the holiday. Since only half a day of trading was conducted this morning and the market will close in the afternoon, and because all buying and selling settlement procedures need to be cleared before the holiday, trading was stable but weak yesterday morning. Most firms had swapping transactions, so there were frequent buys and sells. The market price also fell slightly. In the afternoon, there were many sell orders for Lianhe Runli and Lianyi, further weakening market sentiment. Although Thirty-Eight, Forty-One, Hongda, and Tongkang absorbed and offset some of the selling pressure, supply still exceeded demand. The 9 yuan level for Category C shares was broken again, and the result rebounded by only 2.5 to 5 cents. The transaction volume was about 1.3 to 1.4 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: China Trust Company traded 100 shares ex-dividend, priced at 9 yuan 7.5 cents.</p>
<p>The Public Industry Association reported that the U.S. market was up overnight. The public's belief in the prospect of European peace is perhaps premature. The stock market opened firm. During the half-day, buyers showed great interest in various stocks. Although there was no surprising development, the strength of International Trust, Shanghai Silver Corporation, Jardine Matheson, and other stocks was also noteworthy. At closing, the former was 14 yuan 25 cents and 25 yuan, and the latter also rebounded to 132 yuan 50 cents. Jardine remained stable throughout. British American Tobacco weakened slightly due to labor strikes. Demand for all stocks was good at closing. Rubber stocks, which had previously suffered greatly and were excessively depressed, suddenly turned firm at the opening, and prices rebounded sharply. Transaction volume was huge. Lange &amp; Zeitlin was very active, rebounding to 33 yuan at closing. This stock had recently been heavily sold off due to rumors of poor profit prospects, and the price had continued to fall, but it has now been proven that these rumors were completely false.</p>
<p>London, 19th (Tuesday) dispatch: Today's listed prices for British Far East companies' stocks were slightly weaker. Mercantile Bank shares fell 1 shilling 3 pence, priced at 9 pounds 5 shillings. Glanvill Enthoven Rubber continued to fall 7.5 pence, priced at 20 shillings. The rest were flat.</p>
<p>London, 19th (Tuesday) dispatch: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt were back to stable. There were no changes in any of the bonds.</p>

<h3>Oil Market: Soybean Oil Fell Sharply and Rebounded Slightly</h3>
<p>The oil market was flat yesterday morning. After entering the market, buying and selling began, and asking prices tightened, with each transaction rising sharply. By the afternoon, actual sales were unsustainable, and the market turned short.

<h3>Coal: Indian Coal Arrives, 5,500 Tons</h3>
<p>Since large batches of orders for Indian bituminous coal have arrived one after another, the market has gradually stabilized. The Dachang Coal Company recently received 5,500 tons of Calcutta lump coal, which was unloaded at the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong. The industry is trading at 230 yuan per ton. Goods in the Italian Concession are 10 yuan cheaper, but are limited to small spot sales and are not available for out-of-warehouse orders. It is said that more goods will continue to arrive.</p>
<h3>Grain Market: Che Bai Continues to Loosen</h3>
<p>According to the Dutch telegraph, yesterday coarse white flour fell another 0.30 Dutch guilder, with the C.I.F.K.G. price at 9.10. Therefore, the municipal association's quotation still showed weakness. Spot goods recently arrived at the local and foreign warehouses at 61 yuan, with no rise or fall. Old goods returned to 60.5 yuan. Jardine Matheson's Che Bai B mark was 66 yuan 7 jiao at the West Warehouse, down 0.3 yuan, and 66 yuan 5 jiao at the East Warehouse, down 0.5 yuan.

<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Slightly More Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday's silk market saw a slight rebound in both domestic and foreign prices. New York's near-term price rose by 4 points, and the deferred price rose by 7 points. Yokohama's spot price rose by 20 yuan, and the deferred price rose by 45 yuan. As a result, foreign firms in Shanghai were interested in buying, but it was still difficult to raise the bid price, so there were not many transactions. White filature was 4,900 yuan, and Special Grade Qieli was 2,810 yuan, which was the path for white head merchants. British and French firms only sent telegrams. A total of 30 dan were transacted.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Local Customer Sales Active</h3>
<p>The domestic cloth market first fell and then rebounded, due to the continued strong demand from Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and South China gangs, which increased the sales of gray cloth in this street. And with the rebound in gold, sentiment was revived. The selling price fell by 0.1 to 0.25 yuan in the morning market, and returned to the original price in the afternoon. The swapping of goods among the local hoarders and traders in this street was very active. Dyeing factories entered more than 300 bales of gray cloth, Ningbo gang agents entered more than 200 pieces of coarse cloth, yuan yarn, bleached cloth, poplin, fine cloth, and colored cloth. Wenzhou gang agents entered few goods due to lack of shipping space. Fujian and Guangdong gang agents entered one to two hundred pieces of fine cloth, coarse cloth, colored cloth, and poplin. Nanyang gang entered more than one hundred cases of bleached cloth and colored cloth.</p>

<h3>Today's Activities: Commemorating the Liberation of Shanghai, Recalling the Glorious and Great History, Emulating the Spirit of Hard Struggle</h3>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the National Revolutionary Army's liberation of Shanghai. All sectors of the city are celebrating enthusiastically. Due to the special circumstances, no ceremonies will be held. It has been decided to uphold the national policy with unwavering determination and complete the great cause of resistance and reconstruction. The League of Loyal Comrades of the Kuomintang of China has also issued a "Letter to Comrades in Shanghai in Commemoration of the Liberation of the City," urging comrades to work together and strive forward. It briefly states: "Looking back at this day in 1927, General Chiang Kai-shek led his troops on the Northern Expedition. The party army arrived on the shores of Shanghai, and the military and civilians worked together to liberate the city. Our Shanghai party members rose up bravely, and the masses responded in unison. The warlords were overwhelmed and fled in panic, unable to form a battle line. The remnants and bandits of more than ten years were swept away without a trace. Local tyrants were expelled, corrupt officials were punished, harm was eliminated for the people, traitors were executed for the country, national prestige was restored, and the people's spirit was revived. The Republic of China was able to celebrate its rebirth, thanks to the sincerity of our General and the loyalty and courage of our party's predecessors. At that time, our party comrades were truly 'pioneers of the people, working tirelessly day and night,' so they were able to create this glorious and great history that will last forever. At this time, the General is leading the troops in the war of resistance, and there are frequent reports of victories from the front lines. The final victory is just around the corner. It is hoped that our Shanghai comrades will work even harder, lead the masses, be loyal to the party and the country, and be willing to die. Emulate the spirit of struggle of the past and add to the glory of our Shanghai commemoration. Let us encourage each other."</p>
<h3>Overseas Affairs Department Orders Overseas Chinese Not to Purchase Counterfeit Currency; Bank of China Supplies Legal Tender; Counterfeit Currency is Dull and Coarse</h3>
<p>The Overseas Affairs Department has issued a circular to overseas Chinese, stating: "Regarding the discovery of legal tender of unknown origin around [blank] Ocean, and the imitation of counterfeit currency being sold to overseas Chinese at [blank] prices, the Ministry of Finance has investigated and telegraphed to Kuomintang branches in various places to advise overseas Chinese not to purchase it in order to avoid being deceived. If you really need legal tender, you should contact the branches of the Bank of China or the banks it entrusts to act as agents in various places to purchase it, and it has been telegraphed to the head office of the Bank of China to find out the actual needs of overseas Chinese in various places for legal tender and supply it as much as possible." It is said that most of these counterfeit banknotes are 10-yuan notes. The method of identifying counterfeit banknotes is that the patterns and colors of the counterfeit banknotes are dull and coarse, which can be clearly identified as counterfeit banknotes. This counterfeit currency was made by a certain party in an attempt to disrupt China's finances.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Cables Various Industries to Refuse to Use Military Scrip; Military End Will Immediately Make it Waste Paper; Avoid Damage, Refuse to Buy and Sell</h3>
<p>The various trade associations in the city yesterday forwarded a winter telegram from the Ministry of Finance, which stated: "The Japanese military scrip is used for aggression and is issued without limit. It is even more vicious than banknotes with empty reserves. The end of the military will immediately make it waste paper. Its purely fraudulent behavior to harm our people has been fully exposed. If our people do not examine it carefully, or are greedy for small profits at the moment, [blank] it is closely related to the war of resistance policy, [blank] personal [blank] harm, and the survival of the nation [blank]. The Ministry has previously [blank] issued a ban and telegraphed in January of this year [blank] to advise and warn that military [blank] must never be used and traded, and to explain in detail the nature of military scrip so that the people can understand the advantages and disadvantages and avoid being deceived. Now, according to the previous situation, the telegram is replied to and forwarded for compliance. Therefore, military scrip is a compulsory means of payment in the occupied areas, and the area and time of its exercise are limited. It cannot be compared with ordinary foreign currency. The Ministry of Finance said in the telegram that the end of the military will immediately make it waste paper, which is a fair and appropriate statement. In order to avoid damage, all industries should advise each other not to use it and refuse to buy and sell it. Therefore, this letter is specially delivered for your attention."</p>
<h3>Coal Ball Industry Association Decides to Hold Second Phase of Low-Price Sale; Fixed Period of Ten Days Starting from the 27th; 1,300 Dan Sold Every Day</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Ball Industry Association held a joint meeting of factories at the association's office on Tianjin Road at 3 p.m. yesterday to discuss the continued implementation of low-price coal ball sales. More than ten representatives from Yitaixing, Nanyang, Guohua, Dongfang, Jinghua, and other factories, including You Chunxin, Chen Cuifang, and He Ziguo, attended. Chairman Chen Cuifang first reported the purpose of the meeting and then began discussions. (1) Should the low-price coal ball sale be continued? It was decided that the first phase of the low-price sale would be stopped on the 22nd, and the second phase of the low-price sale would be continued on the 27th, for a fixed period of ten days. (2) How should the small coal ball factories be rescued due to the high cost of coal dust? It was decided that in addition to the previous rescue, Yitaixing would supply 500 tons at a low price, Dalongxing 300 tons, Tongcheng 100 tons, and Hancheng 100 tons, for a total of 1,000 tons. The method of distribution will be jointly decided by the association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The rest of the cases were omitted. The meeting adjourned at around 5 p.m. As for the number of low-price coal balls supplied by each factory, it has been decided. According to the reporter of Xinsheng News Agency, (1) Yitaixing 500 dan, Nanyang 200 dan, Guohua 70 dan, Guanghua 40 dan, Dongfang 70 dan, Jinghua 60 dan, Yuedong 20 dan, Huacheng Cuiji 20 dan, Heji 5 dan, Yuanhua 10 dan, and Public Use 40 dan, for a total of 10,350 dan. 1,350 dan will be sold at a low price every day. All the methods are the same as in the first phase. Each person is limited to 2 jiao per purchase, which is 4 catties. It will still be sold from 2 p.m. every day until the quota is full. The location of the low-price sale may be changed. It can be officially decided and announced by the 25th of this month.</p>
<p>Opinions on Remedying the Coal Ball Panic</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Joint Association of Coal and Firewood Shops sent representatives to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and Yu Qiaqing, a well-known businessman, to petition separately. As a result, the Chamber of Commerce agreed to provide assistance, and Yu Qiaqing agreed to transfer it to the Chamber of Commerce for processing. Today, they plan to continue to petition the Public Works Department. The main points of the resolutions listed in the petition are recorded below. (1) It is found that some coal ball factories are stopping night work, and some are using machine repairs as an excuse. As a result, the output has decreased, which is far different from today last year. Furthermore, the self-operated retail outlets are given priority in delivering goods, and the remaining goods are supplied to the shops that issue warehouse warrants, and the remaining goods are then supplied to the retail stores. Regardless of how much is left, the supply is given to those who have a good relationship, and those who do not have a good relationship are refused. It is difficult for the retail stores to continue their business. The factories' concurrent retail operations can monopolize the livelihoods of the retail stores, and the drawbacks of the warehouse warrants are the main reasons for the creation. Although the issuance of warehouse warrants has been suspended on the surface, the output has been reduced deliberately, trying to deceive the public, and using self-operated retail outlets to cover it up. To eliminate the disease, each factory must stop retailing and issue all the quantities specified for the low-price coal ball sale to the members' stores of our association. (2) It is found that the current retail price of coal balls is 5.8 yuan per dan. When delivered to the house, it can be sold for 116 yuan per ton. The factory sells it for 110 yuan per ton. The car fee is 2 yuan. Each ton contains at least 300 catties of coal ball dust, which is exchanged back at a 10% discount. The loss of coal balls and round-trip car fare is about 2.4 yuan. Moreover, the coal balls are still hot when they are shipped recently, and the moisture has not been removed, so the weight increases. When it is cold, each [blank] loses 40 catties, which is worth 2.4 yuan. In this way, the cost of purchasing coal balls for retail stores is 116.8 yuan per ton. Compared with selling it for 116 yuan, not only is there no profit, but it is also a loss. The pain of the retail stores is unbearable. Recently, the factory has also proposed to exchange coal dust for balls at an 80% discount, which is unbearable for the retail stores. It should be based on maintaining the livelihood of the retail stores, and the coal dust exchange for balls should still maintain the usual 90% discount. (3) According to recent reports from members, the factories have changed the way of delivering coal balls, causing the stores to go through many twists and turns and increase damage. Furthermore, the purchase of coal balls is limited to banknotes from the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China. All these kinds of things, I hope that the factories will understand the suffering of the retail stores.</p>
<h3>Domestic Postage Increase; No Order Received Yet; Public Letters Will Inevitably Increase Sooner or Later</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Post Office has not yet received an order from the Kunming General Post Office regarding the report in the North-China Daily News that postage rates within China will be increased, so the date of implementation is not yet certain. According to sources, the report that domestic postage rates will be increased by one level starting next month may be inaccurate, but they will eventually be increased sooner or later. It is said that the Kunming General Post Office has discussed and decided to increase the postage for ordinary letters to various parts of the country to 7 cents, and the postage for local letters will also be increased from 2 cents to 3 cents.</p>
<h3>Noodle Industry Asks to Suppress Flour Prices; Limited to 12 Yuan per Bag; At the Same Time, Limiting Noodle Prices</h3>
<p>The low-price flour sale ended temporarily on the 18th of this month. In order to find a proper solution, the Shanghai Machine-Made Noodle Industry Association held a temporary general meeting of all members' representatives at the Tongle Teahouse on Zhejiang Road at 4 p.m. the day before yesterday to discuss (1) the request to suppress the flour price to 12 yuan as a limit. It was decided and unanimously passed. (2) If low-price flour is obtained, try to promote the sales of Fufeng and Fuxin flour as much as possible. If the price of recycled goods is lower, resolutely refuse to use it. It was decided and passed. (3) Although the low-price flour has been temporarily suspended, the price of retail and wholesale noodles is uniformly 2.8 jiao per city catty, and must not exceed the limit. If violated, severe punishment will be imposed. It was decided and unanimously passed.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul Attempts to Interfere in Concession Sanitation Administration; The Authorities Believe that the Japanese Argument is Inappropriate; Are Considering Their Suggestions</h3>
<p>According to sources from the Public Works Department, the department is currently considering the Japanese Consul General's request to cooperate with the Public Works Department to improve sanitation in the Concession area. It is said that the results of the consideration are currently unknown. However, according to the Bureau, although the Bureau has not cooperated with the Japanese in sanitation matters in the past, the Sanitation Department has always been willing to cooperate with all parties. According to this news, the spokesperson of the Japanese Consulate General publicly stated that the sanitation conditions in the Concession area last year were far below the sanitation conditions in the Japanese-occupied areas, so the Japanese side is willing to cooperate with the Public Works Department to engage in prevention and other work. Officials of the Public Works Department believe that the Japanese argument is inappropriate because the Japanese side has not clearly defined the scope of what is called "Japanese-occupied area."</p>
<h3>More Than 300 Groups in Shanghai Welcome Gauss</h3>
<p>The US Consulate General officially announced yesterday that the US Consul General in Shanghai, Gauss, will leave Shanghai on the "President Taft" on April 2 to take up the post of US Consul General in Australia. Because Mr. Gauss is about to leave Shanghai, all sectors of the foreign community in the city are holding farewell banquets. It is said that the American Marines have scheduled a horse race at the Racecourse at 9 a.m. next Thursday, and the American University Alumni Association will hold a dance party at the American Overseas Chinese Association next Wednesday to show their farewell. It is said that Mr. Gauss will deliver a brief speech on that day.</p>
<h3>British Government Requisitions Two Ships from Jardine Matheson; Both Sail to Singapore</h3>
<p>According to sources in the foreign community, the British government has now requisitioned two more ships from Jardine Matheson, a British company in Shanghai, the "Yee Ho" and the "Fook Ho". It is learned that the "Yee Ho" has a deadweight of 342 tons and left Shanghai on the evening of the 19th. The "Fook Ho" has a deadweight of 500 tons and left port yesterday. The two ships will stay in Hong Kong for a few days and then sail to Singapore to be dispatched by the British naval authorities. Also, the British naval authorities are unwilling to comment on this news and are unwilling to announce whether the British government will requisition ships in the future. Also, it is learned that the British company Weir &amp; Co.'s giant ships "Su San" and "Caroline" were also requisitioned by the government and left port a few months ago.</p>
<p>According to sources in the shipping industry, the arrival and departure times of all British ships will no longer be published in the shipping column of the local Western newspapers. It is said that this measure is entirely due to the recent situation in Europe. As for passengers, etc., if they want to find out the shipping schedule, they must inquire directly with the shipping company.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Loans Concentrated in the Four Banks; Establishment of Agricultural Finance Office; Each Bank Shares Loans</h3>
<p>After the Four Banks of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank, and Farmers Bank passed the outline of the agricultural loan method for the 29th year, the four industries have established an Agricultural Finance Office, with Hou Zhe'an as the director. The total amount of agricultural loans will be determined at any time according to the actual needs of various places, and will be shared by the various banks according to the following proportions: Central Trust Bureau 15, China 25, Communications 15, China Agricultural 35, Farmers Bank 10. It has been decided to give priority to the provinces in the rear, and Sichuan and Xikang will be the primary areas. Other provinces and regions will be determined by the four banks at any time according to the situation. It is said that after the establishment of the office, it will be responsible for the unified planning, supervision, and liaison of all agricultural loan matters in the country. In the past, the China Farmers Bank was the largest lender of agricultural loans in China, followed by the China and Communications Banks. The Farmers Bank and provincial banks in various provinces all handled small-scale agricultural loans. In the future, they will be concentrated in the Four Banks of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank, and Farmers Bank.</p>
<h3>Falsified Telegrams; All Associations Deny; Industry Leaders Unanimously Express Their Attitude; Willing to Stay at Their Posts and Fulfill Their National Responsibilities</h3>
<p>All members of the various trade associations in the city have always been patriotic and enthusiastic. In this difficult environment, they still adhere to their posts and struggle hard. However, there are one or two unscrupulous elements who fabricate various meanings, privately engrave seals, and respond to "peace." All members are extremely indignant. The Grain, Oil Cake, Antique, Underwear Knitting, Sauce Garden, and Ground Goods Trade Associations have published in the newspaper, solemnly denying this. Cigarette Factory, Hotel, Rubber, and Woolen Factory Industries have also made solemn statements to the competent authorities, resolutely supporting the central government's national policy of resistance and construction. According to investigations, of the more than 100 trade associations named in the telegram responding to "peace" published in a certain newspaper this time, 65 have not been formally established, or even have no such name. 41 of them have been shut down. As for those who actually have such a name and are active, they actually knew nothing about this matter beforehand. Then this telegram is undoubtedly fabricated. Industry leaders have made solemn expressions. Yesterday, a certain newspaper published a telegram from the silver and money industries. After inquiring from the silver and money industries, they all condemned the theft of their names and will also make a solemn denial. A certain party was thus enraged and instigated its so-called "Special Operations Headquarters" to use terrorist means to intimidate all sectors. Several sectors have received threatening letters yesterday, but all sectors said that they will not be afraid and will definitely fulfill their due national responsibilities.</p>

<h3>British Merchant Ship "Yongfeng" Aground Off Wenzhou; Situation Serious, Rescue Efforts Ongoing; Passengers and Cargo Transferred by Barge</h3>
<p>The British merchant ship "Josephine Moller" (永豐) of Messrs. Moller &amp; Co., leased by the Far Eastern Shipping Company in Shanghai and operating on the Shanghai-Wenzhou route, has been sailing for many times. The ship sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou last week, carrying a large quantity of export goods such as cotton yarn. After arriving off Wenzhou, it was blocked by Japanese warships and had to stay outside the port for several days. Later, the "Manly Moller," which had also sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou, arrived off Wenzhou as well. The two ships once sailed to the vicinity of the Oujiang River estuary, but were spotted by Japanese warships and chased by a motorboat. Unable to enter the port, they wandered outside. On the night of the tenth, the two ships detoured and entered the Oujiang River. The "Manly" entered first due to its smaller size, while the "Yongfeng" ran aground at the entrance.</p>
<p>The "Manly" did not witness the grounding at the time. It was only when it returned to Shanghai from Wenzhou the day before yesterday that it saw the ship aground on the sandbank. It was learned that the grounding was quite serious due to the ship sailing at full speed. Fortunately, it did not hit a reef, so the hull was undamaged. Upon learning of the incident, the company hired a barge to transport part of the cargo and five passengers to Wenzhou. It is reported that the sandbank there is too high, and the tide cannot submerge it on ordinary days, and the barge's power is insufficient, so the ship has not been rescued yet.</p>
<p>The company is currently trying to carry out rescue efforts. According to company staff, the ship had previously called at Xinghua to unload all the cargo there, preparing to go to Wenzhou to load cargo to Shanghai, so it was traveling empty. The company only received a telegram about the grounding, and no detailed report has been received as of yesterday.</p>
<h3>Initial Election of British and American Directors; Ballots Must Be Mailed Today</h3>

The deadline for voting is set at noon on Saturday (the 22nd) for British voters and Tuesday (the 25th) for American voters. However, the voting period coincides with Easter. Both election committees are deeply concerned that voters may delay due to this holiday, resulting in invalid ballots. Therefore, they issued an application yesterday, urging all eligible voters to mail their ballots as soon as possible today, as the Easter holiday begins tomorrow and will last until next Monday.</p>
<h3>Mobile Troops on the Qinghu Road Launch Night Attack on Chonggu, Cut Military Telephone Lines, and Attack Baihejiang</h3>
<p>Along the Qingpu-Shanghai Highway, the Chinese mobile troops have been very active in recent days. It is reported that the Japanese military telephone lines between Chonggu and Baihejiang were sabotaged by the Third Detachment of Gu Fusheng's troops, who cut off four to five hundred feet of telephone lines. At the same time, Gu's troops launched a night attack on the Japanese and puppet troops in Chonggu and Baihejiang, inflicting a great blow on the Japanese army. The next morning, more than two hundred Japanese and puppet troops were dispatched to search the surrounding villages in an attempt to retaliate, but to no avail. Yesterday, more than one hundred Japanese and puppet troops encountered Gu Fusheng's troops in Lujiajiao. They were ambushed by Gu's troops and, after a fierce battle for half an hour, were forced to retreat to Xujing after many of their vanguard troops were killed.</p>
<h3>Tomb-Sweeping Day; Banks and Foreign Firms Closed; Municipal Council and Public Works Bureau Also Closed</h3>

<h3>American Missionary Couple Returns to Work in China; Will Return to Kunming via the Burma Road and Resume Teaching at Huazhong University</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily News, Mrs. Miller, an English professor and missionary at Huazhong University, arrived in Shanghai on the President Adams on the 19th after a short vacation in the United States. She plans to travel with her husband to Yunnan via the Burma Road and return to Huazhong University. Huazhong University was originally in Hankou, but has now moved to the Southwest due to the Sino-Japanese War.</p>
<p>Mrs. Miller first came to China as a girl in her teens. She has spent almost her entire life in the Chinese interior. Now that she is gray-haired, she can symbolize the entire process of missionary activities in China. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, the Millers were on vacation in Guling. Before long, the summer resort also became a battlefield. They and other foreigners set out at night along narrow mountain paths, trekking all night, and only discovered after traveling thirty-five miles that they had passed through the battle lines of both armies. Mrs. Miller does not know where Huazhong University is in Yunnan Province and will travel with her husband to find it.</p>
<h3>Collection of Handling Fee for Tuberculosis Prevention X-Ray Examination; To Cover Film and Electricity Costs; Public Criticism Based on Misunderstanding</h3>
<p>Since the opening ceremony of the Tuberculosis Prevention Movement Congress, initiated by leaders from all walks of life in the city, at the Hongqiao Sanatorium at 990 Xiafei Road on the 15th of this month, many people have gone for diagnosis, examination, and X-ray examination. The authorities of the sanatorium are also working very hard in the spirit of service. However, some people have criticized the fact that a handling fee of two yuan must be paid for X-ray examination. At a time when everything is expensive and life is difficult, it is feared that the movement will not be expanded and the beneficiaries will be difficult to universalize if a fee is charged for examination. Therefore, all parties hope that the responsible authorities will consider this matter so that the tuberculosis prevention movement can be further promoted. A reporter from the Pingming News Agency interviewed Ding Huikang, director of Hongqiao Sanatorium, about the issue of charging for X-ray examination yesterday. According to Ding, although the movement has received enthusiastic donations from all walks of life, the daily expenses are huge, such as the cost of X-ray film and the consumption of electricity. Therefore, although we charge a handling fee of two yuan, it is only to slightly cover the costs. Since the opening ceremony, the expenses have been difficult to bear. The staff is also very busy serving all day long. In short, in order to promote the tuberculosis prevention movement, the hospital is willing to fulfill its obligations in terms of human and material losses. However, the tuberculosis prevention movement is not a charitable cause, and the public's criticism seems to be based on misunderstanding. Ding also said that since the opening ceremony, more than one hundred people have come to participate in the examination every day. According to statistics, about one in three people suffers from tuberculosis, which shows the rampant tuberculosis bacteria on the isolated island. As for the duration of the movement, it is tentatively set for one month, from the 15th of this month to the 15th of next month. Whether to extend it after the expiration date still needs to be considered depending on the situation.</p>
<h3>Opening of British Army Defense Zone on North Xizang Road; This Move is in Response to a Request from the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>According to a public announcement issued by the British Army authorities in the city, the Japanese side yesterday requested the British side to open the barbed wire fence in Zone "B" to facilitate the entry and exit of goods from the puppet regime's "Central Vegetable Market." It is said that this request has been considered by the British Army authorities and the Municipal Council authorities. The British Army authorities have agreed to open the area along North Xizang Road, but reserve the right to close the area at any time. A statement issued by the British Army Headquarters said, "The British Army Commander has received a request from the Japanese Naval Landing Forces to open the barbed wire fence in Zone "B." The reason given is that the "Central Vegetable Market" run by the "Shanghai Special Municipal Government" is about to open. The British Army Commander has also notified the Municipal Council of this request. The Municipal Council has not made any statement. Therefore, the British Army authorities have allowed the Japanese side this request and decided to open the Xizang Road area from 9:30 today. At the few import and export points where Zhabei and the concession adjoin, troops and police will be stationed by both sides. Citizens can enter and exit freely without a pass. However, the British Army authorities stated that they reserve the right to close it at any time."</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to foreign sources, the "Shanghai Central Market," run by the puppet "Municipal Government," will open at 10:00 a.m. on the 13th at the site located at 21 Guangfu Road in Zhabei.</p>
<h3>British Nationals Will Investigate Damage to Assets in China; Will Conduct Research According to American Practice; As a Basis for Negotiations with the Japanese Side</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the assets of third countries in China have been repeatedly damaged by the Japanese side. The US State Department has lodged more than six hundred protests with the Japanese Foreign Ministry as a result. Recently, the Japanese side, with US-Japan relations extremely tense, is eager to ease American public opinion, and is therefore striving to resolve the outstanding US-Japan cases. According to Suma Yakichiro, Director of the Information Department of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, announced on February 21, the Japanese side has resolved nineteen American protest cases by means of compensation. However, after the American nationals here checked the items listed, they discovered that in some of the so-called resolved cases, the Japanese side had not yet paid the compensation or had only paid part of the total amount requested. Therefore, the American nationals here were unwilling to tacitly consent to a nominal resolution, and last week organized a War Damage Claims Group to investigate the details of the damage and the actual situation of the compensation, in order to obtain a satisfactory settlement through continued negotiations. According to foreign sources, the British nationals here have heard of this organization of American nationals and attach great importance to it, because the assets of British nationals in China have also been destroyed in the same situation and have not yet been compensated. For example, some British assets in Zhoujiazui in Pudong, Shanghai, were destroyed by the Japanese side. Although it has been heard that the Japanese side is preparing to resolve the matter, there has been no further news. Therefore, according to the British nationals, the damages suffered by the Japanese side since the war should also be investigated and requested in accordance with the established practice of the American nationals, so as not to allow the rights and interests to be despised, and to assist the formal negotiations of the consular authorities.</p>
<h3>Dredging of the Huangpu River Difficult to Resume; Flood Prevention Should Be Carried Out This Autumn</h3>
<p>Although the Shanghai Dredging Bureau has been forced to reorganize and an agreement has been reached, with the position of Chief Engineer being occupied by the Japanese Fujita, the dredging of the Huangpu River by the bureau has been difficult to resume. Chinese and foreign shipping merchants have been eagerly awaiting the dredging of the Huangpu River channel, but the news has been silent. It is found that the key to the bureau's inability to resume the dredging of the Huangpu River is that the Japanese side has not yet returned all the ships. A few of the ships that have been released, such as the "Construction" large dredger and the "Liliang" survey ship, are not suitable for work in the Huangpu River because they are all large ships, and these ships are still under repair. The fact that the riverbed of the Huangpu River has been high and the water depth has receded due to the lack of dredging for a long time is acknowledged by the engineering personnel of the Dredging Bureau as a public fact. If dredging is not carried out in time, not only will navigation be seriously affected, but also the floods that will be added to the land in Shanghai when the autumn floods arrive will inevitably become more and more serious. This is indeed a problem that deserves attention.</p>

<h3>The Li Yongkuan Father and Sons Case; Appeal to the Third Instance; Conspiracy to Commit Perjury Exposed; Li's Wife and Others Arrested</h3>
<p>Li Yongkuan, Li Jiazhou, and Li Bihua, a father and sons from Anhui who were notorious salt smugglers, arrogantly claimed to be "Captains of the Pacification Team" in the Ruanxiang coastal area of ​​Punan, Songjiang County, after the National Army withdrew westward. They forcibly abducted two girls from Xihutang Township, Lin Xiuhua and She Yuexian, and forced them to marry Jiazhou and Bihua. Li Jiazhou also shot and killed Lin's mother. In the spring of the year before last, after being disarmed by the Zhengfeng Army, Li and his sons could not stand their ground, so they took their families and the two girls and fled to Shanghai, hiding in No. 10, Ciyou Zhongxing New Village, Xujiahui Town. They imprisoned and monitored Lin and She. Later, the two girls escaped through a gap and reported to the French Concession Police. The police arrested Li and his sons and sent them to the Second Court for prosecution on charges of robbery, murder, rape, and obstruction of freedom. Lin and She also filed a civil lawsuit. At that time, because there was a problem with jurisdiction over the location of Li's crime, the court submitted a request to the Supreme Court, which approved and designated the case to be accepted and tried by the court of original jurisdiction. As a result, Li Yongkuan was sentenced to twelve years in prison for continuous robbery, Li Jiazhou was sentenced to eighteen years in prison, and Li Bihua was sentenced to ten years in prison. Li and sons refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. As a result, the appeal was rejected. In the civil suit, the two trials also ruled that Li Jiazhou and Li Bihua should each compensate Lin Xiuhua and She Yuexian with 1,600 yuan in legal currency, and Li Jiazhou should also be responsible for Lin's mother's funeral expenses of 500 yuan. The details of each case have been recorded in previous reports. However, because Li still refused to accept the sentence after being sentenced, he appealed to the Supreme Court again. As a result, the case was sent back to the Third Branch of the High Court for retrial. Before the hearing, Li Yongshi's wife, Li Ru, and Li went to the countryside and colluded with local gentry Cai Ding and Lu Baoren, using deceptive words and intimidation to coerce She Zhuping, the father of She, to come to Shanghai, testify in the case, falsely claiming that his daughter was betrothed to Li Bihua with his consent. On the one hand, she also colluded with the rural woman Yang Cai to come to the case, falsely claiming that she had witnessed Lin's mother die from stray bullets, in order to overturn the previous testimony. The case was investigated by Judge Wang Yue in the investigation court the day before yesterday. Li and his sons entrusted lawyer Yu Enliang to defend them. After stating the reasons for the appeal, the court summoned all the witnesses for questioning and instructed them to continue the trial at a later date. Unexpectedly, after the adjournment, Lin and Yu, believing that Li's wife, Yao, dared to coerce Lin's father, Lin Zhuping, to come to Shanghai and give false testimony, imprisoning him in a hotel and preventing him from acting freely, and preventing the father and daughter from meeting, committed acts of obstructing freedom, waited at the gate of the court and called for arrest. Yao and Yang Cai were taken to the police station on the spot. After a detailed interrogation by the police chief, they all confessed the truth and confessed that the instigators Cai Dingyi and Lu Baoren were hiding in Room 31 of the Yunzhou Hotel on Edward Road. The police were dispatched to the hotel, but Cai and Lu had already fled after hearing the news. Only two accomplices, Xia Yiqing and Ding Shouqing, were arrested. Yesterday afternoon, the group of people was sent to the Third Branch of the High Court, and Judge Wang Yue presided over the trial in the Fifth Court. He ordered that the audience be prohibited from attending. As a result, he ordered that Li Yao, Yang Cai, Yu Zhuping, Yi, and Ding Shouqing, a total of five people, be returned for investigation and prosecuted separately.</p>
<h3>The Case of the Shooting of Liu Zhongying; The Principal Offender Ju Lun is at Large; Accomplice Xiao Yonglin Interrogated and Awaiting Judgment</h3>
<p>Liu Zhongying (42 years old), a native of Ningbo, was the manager of the Daya Radio Station on Jiujiang Road. His family lived in the radio station. At 8:45 a.m. on February 17, Liu went out on business, riding in a chartered car pulled by a Sikh rickshaw puller (a native of Tongzhou). When he was outside in Lane 555, Jiujiang Road, he was suddenly assassinated by thugs. The bullet hit a vital part and he died. At that time, two Chinese policemen, No. 1019 and No. 792, of the Laozha Police Station, arrested a suspect named Xiao Yonglin (a native of Changshu, a few years old) at the corner of Hankou Road and Jiujiang. They found a pistol and ten bullets in his trouser pocket. They learned that he lived at No. 25, Lane 80, Zhidi Ao Road, in the French Concession. The two Chinese policemen, together with Chinese and foreign detectives from the police station, rushed to his home and found another box of bullets, totaling twenty-seven, as well as several seals and a draft of a threatening letter, and brought them back to the police station together, and sent them to the First Special Court. The police station filed a public prosecution in accordance with the crime of homicide. Because it was found that the principal offender named Ju Lun was at large, Xiao Yonglin was ordered to be remanded in custody for further investigation. The case was heard by Judge Jiang Shuzi in the Criminal Third Court yesterday morning. Money Tao Jiu, a lawyer from the police station, claimed that during the change of date, the principal offender Tang Lun could not be detained. The defendant said at the police station that he and Tang Lun used to be colleagues in a certain weaving factory, so they knew each other. After the factory closed down, he was unemployed at home. Around February 18, Tang Lun came to his house and asked him where he was working. Only then did he know that he was unemployed. Tang said that he was working in a certain place and could introduce him to work, etc. Over the next few days, Tang repeatedly came to his house and asked him to help him wait at the entrance of Lane 555, Jiujiang Road, and handed him a pistol. At that time, he was on lookout in the lane. When he heard a gunshot in the lane, he fled. He was caught by the two police officers at the corner of Hankou Road and Jiujiang Road because they saw that he looked flustered, and he was arrested, etc. Then, Liu's wife, Chen (40 years old), made an incidental civil claim against the defendant, requesting compensation for living expenses of 400 yuan per month, which was her husband's income from various institutions, until the age of sixty, totaling 97,200 yuan. Rickshaw puller Sha A San also testified about the process of his employer Liu Zhongying being killed at that time. In questioning the defendant Xiao Yonglin's confession, Tang Lun's friend instigated him to be on the lookout, for which he received 20 yuan per month. He asked for leniency and hired lawyer Wang Yaotang to defend him, asking for a lenient sentence. Judge Jiang ordered him to be remanded in custody and set the sentencing for next Wednesday.</p>
<h3>Traffic Accident on Xiafei Road; Car Overturns, Seven Injured; Including Four Passengers, Two Pedestrians, and One Driver</h3>
<p>According to the French newspaper, yesterday (the 15th) at 5:35 p.m., a tragedy occurred on Xiafei Road due to the driver's carelessness, resulting in seven injuries. It was found that a Chinese private car, No. 1514, was speeding towards the Bund on Xiafei Road with a Chinese driver. Near Masnan Road, it attempted to overtake a Western car and drove to the left side of the road. At this time, a tram was coming from the opposite direction. The driver turned sharply to the left. Due to poor visibility or excessive speed, the car drove straight towards the short lamppost at the tram station. At that time, he tried to avoid it, but as a result, he crashed into a tree on the side of the road. The car body then backed up and crashed into the window of a store on the south side of Xiafei Road, and the car overturned. Two pedestrians were knocked down and seriously injured. Four passengers in the car were also seriously injured. The driver suffered only minor injuries, except for a broken face. The owner of the car was sitting next to the driver, and his head was injured the most when it crashed into the windshield. Two Chinese people sitting in the car, one had a leg injury and the other was cut by broken glass. Afterwards, the police arrived and sent all the injured to Guangci Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Glucose Calcium Lawsuit Concluded</h3>
<p>Dr. Yu Tingxiang prescribed glucose calcium injections produced by American Puer Strong Company for a patient with a cold and cough, and a reaction occurred. He filed a private criminal lawsuit against Wu Zhiwei, the Far East General Manager of the company, for negligent injury with the First District Court. After a detailed trial, the court ruled in Chinese that "Wu Zhiwei is not guilty." The reasoning was roughly: "Puer Strong Company is a well-known American pharmaceutical factory with sophisticated equipment, and its glucose calcium has been sold for a long time. The defendant, Wu Zhiwei, also inquired with American Puer Strong Company regarding the situation described by the plaintiff. After repeated experiments by the company, it was determined that the product did not contain any toxic substances or other defects. The company's reply can be used as evidence. Therefore, in normal circumstances, the use of this drug for injection is unlikely to harm a person's health. The defendant's promotion should not be considered negligent simply because an abnormal reaction occurred after a buyer's injection. Moreover, whether the plaintiff's claimed health damage is entirely true and whether it was caused by the poor quality of the drug itself have not been actively proven. The defendant cannot be compared to someone who knowingly distributes inferior drugs that are crudely manufactured and substandard. Therefore, it is difficult to hold him liable for negligent injury under the law." The plaintiff was not satisfied and appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The court held a hearing on the 20th of this month. Wu Zhiwei's side presented a chemical test report from the Shanghai Municipal Council's testing laboratory to prove that the glucose calcium from American Puer Strong Company was indeed pure and flawless. Under the interrogation of the presiding judge, a mediation was attempted. Dr. Shao Tingxiang admitted the misunderstanding and withdrew the appeal, accepting the original verdict. Wu Zhiwei's side also agreed not to pursue the matter further and not to file a counterclaim for false accusation. Therefore, the lawsuit has been declared concluded.</p>
<h3>Robbers Open Fire on Route Tenant de Bie</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, seven robbers, all armed with military pistols, broke into an oil shop at No. 80 Route Tenant de Bie at 2:15 a.m. on the 20th to commit robbery. The Jing'an Temple Police received the report and dispatched officers to the scene, but the robbers had already fled. The police, seeing that the oil shop was located outside the boundaries of the concession, decided not to handle the case. However, as the officers were investigating around the house, the robbers who had fled into an alley suddenly fired several shots. The bullets flew past the officers, narrowly missing them. Several bullet casings were collected and taken back to the police station.</p>
<p>At 8:00 a.m. on the same day, three robbers also broke into a leather factory owned by the Su family near Route Tenant de Bie to commit robbery. One of them was armed with a gun. Approximately fifty workers in the factory, upon seeing this, showed no fear and rushed towards the three robbers. The robber fired one shot, but no one was injured. He was immediately captured. However, the two unarmed robbers escaped while the workers were surrounding the armed robber. The captured robber has been handed over to the local police station.</p>
<h3>Widespread Suffering in Xiaoshao Area, Representatives Sent to Shanghai to Beg for Funds</h3>
<p>Since the start of military action in eastern Zhejiang, the Xiaoshao area has suffered the most, with countless displaced people in dire need of food. Shaoxing County, being at the forefront of eastern Zhejiang, has suffered particularly badly. Transportation is blocked, food supplies are cut off, and most businesses have closed down. Those with any assets have relocated elsewhere. Donations are impossible to collect, and relief efforts are difficult. In order to seek relief, the county government and the county chamber of commerce jointly appointed Fang Wenying, a standing committee member of the county chamber of commerce, to travel to Shanghai to appeal to fellow villagers for donations. Since arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Fang has been appealing and working tirelessly, gaining the support and sympathy of various parties. It is reported that fundraising has been completed and the results are very good. Mr. Fang set off back to Shaoxing yesterday to handle emergency relief. It is hoped that all fellow villagers will continue to donate generously to benefit the disaster-stricken people of their hometown. It is reported that the Shanghai Zhejiang Local Bank has been entrusted to collect donations, or they can be sent directly to the Shaoxing County Chamber of Commerce for collection.</p>

<p>The Problem of the Unity of Spirit and Flesh in Love. Love must occupy the whole heart and mind, and then bloom into brilliant flowers!</p>
<p>Spirit is the soul, that is, the mental aspect. Flesh is the body, that is, carnal desire. Let's be frank: whether they are moralists, religious figures... when they enter the atmosphere of love, they cannot avoid the interplay of spirit and flesh. Therefore, the unity of spirit and flesh is truly the only principle of love. If a couple only pays lip service without real action, or if the action is too little to satisfy the other party's needs, no matter how eloquently they talk about the spiritual aspect of love, their entire love is likely to burst like a soap bubble in the wind. There are many facts to prove this: when Yang Guifei was sexually frustrated, why couldn't she love Gao Lishi? Why did Pan Jinlian fall in love with Wu Song? Why do the beautiful wives and concubines of wealthy bureaucrats or businessmen leave them? Why are ordinary couples very satisfied and happy? Everything proves that love must be united in spirit and flesh. Unity of spirit and flesh leads to fulfillment and happiness, while a lack of unity leads to imperfection and suffering!</p>
<p>As the Western saying goes: "A sound mind in a sound body." Both spirit and flesh must be based on physical health. Therefore, if a man is physically strong and full of energy, unless he has already found someone else, his love will inevitably be passionate and tender. His wife is truly blessed! However, if a man has committed self-indulgence and damaged the endocrine fluids in his reproductive glands, causing weakness, premature ejaculation, impotence, underdevelopment, thin sperm, and infertility, then even if his wife is as beautiful as a flower, he will want to love her, but his heart is willing, but his body is unable. If this continues, the wife's youth will be wasted, and her emotions will be unhappy. This can lead to depression and illness. Driven by instinct, she may be tempted by other men and commit adultery or elope, or she may even file for divorce with her husband, citing justifiable reasons. Such cases are often seen in today's society! Therefore, husbands must be full of energy, and if they have symptoms of weakness, they must be treated as soon as possible. According to world-renowned doctors and our experience, the most effective treatment is to take "Reproduction Element," a preparation made from the reproductive glands of healthy animals. This preparation is made of precious materials, has reliable efficacy, a mild nature, and a great restorative power, surpassing any similar preparation. After taking this preparation, a man can produce sperm, strengthen the kidneys, nourish the brain, and invigorate the blood within a day and night. Continued use will further promote development and thicken sperm and blood. The aforementioned symptoms can be completely cured in a short period of time, making energy exceptionally abundant. Regular use by middle-aged and elderly people can prolong life and rejuvenate. However, those with seminal emission must also take the special "Hymitos' Semen-Consolidating Tablets" (available at China-West Five Continents Pharmacy and Wing On Company's Western Drug Department, priced at two yuan per box) to stop the discharge and achieve rapid results.</p>
<h3>The Threat and Remedy of Breast Atrophy</h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei</p>
<p>I truly admire the superb skills of Shanghai tailors. You see, the entire outline of a woman's body, such as the breasts, hips, waist, and thighs, can be fully revealed on a cheongsam, making the curves clear and the posture graceful. This is so helpful for a woman's beauty! But then again, although the skills of Shanghai tailors are superb and can make perfectly fitting new clothes, they are only suitable for women with healthy and beautiful bodies. As for women who have been sick and in pain for a long time, resulting in breast atrophy, thin hips, and loss of beauty, even the most amazing skills are powerless. Ask, how can they use wooden collars when their chests are flat and their hips are as thin as a monkey's butt? Although some people say that breast atrophy can be disguised with artificial breasts, the disguise can only cover up for a while, and sooner or later it will be exposed. Once they are bathing, and nothing remains, or "in the spring boudoir, the golden帳 hangs low, and in the mandarin duck quilt, they imitate a pair of birds," where will they have to escape? Not only that, but men's hearts are easily changed. When both sides love each other deeply, they can still barely maintain their commitment. But once a woman's defects or ugliness are discovered, they will inevitably become fickle, finding another partner, or seeking pleasure with prostitutes, treating the family like a temporary shelter, or hiding a mistress in a golden house, treating the wife like a stranger. The marriage exists in name only. Therefore, women who have lost their beauty must be aware of the danger! As for the remedy, in today's era of advanced science, it is very easy. According to Chinese and Western doctors and my experience, simply taking "Sexual Element" for women, a preparation made from the endocrine glands of the reproductive glands and ovaries, can restore ovarian function, boost metabolism, regulate menstruation, warm the uterus, and stop leucorrhea within a day and night. Continued use will guarantee that the breasts will be high and plump, the cheeks will be rosy, and beauty will be enhanced in a short period of time.</p>
<h3>Young Men with Seminal Emission Beware of Spring Plague</h3>
<p>— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>Spring is indeed the season of vigorous growth for all things, and it is also the time when diseases breed. A man who is strong and has good resistance will naturally appear more robust and lively in this warm spring. However, a young man suffering from seminal emission, due to weakness and lack of resistance, will feel that the spring weather is severe, and will easily catch colds and coughs, have dizziness and headaches, backaches, or even contract the spring plague, falling ill for weeks. What a loss of time, money, and spirit! However, this is a minor matter. If the spring plague lasts for years and months, or even becomes incurable, will it not ruin his future, bury his youth and happiness, and end his life?</p>
<p>Originally, the semen in a man's body, physiologically speaking, is the endocrine fluid of the reproductive glands, which can directly penetrate into the blood and irrigate the whole body. Its functions are to promote development, nourish the nerves, regulate emotions, initiate love, and especially enhance resistance and prevent disease. Therefore, young people who can maintain their self-respect and keep their energy abundant will inevitably have a majestic physique, clear thinking, strong performance, and a promising and limitless future! If they do not know how to cherish themselves, commit self-indulgence, causing the seminal vesicle to relax, leading to seminal emission, and then neglect treatment, it will inevitably lead to exhaustion of energy, resulting in brain failure, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, premature ejaculation, impotence, underdevelopment, and other symptoms. Such young people will inevitably fail in their studies, have difficulty completing their careers, and will be abandoned by women and hated by wives and concubines. What future and happiness can they have?</p>
<p>I now sincerely advise young people: self-indulgence must not be committed. If you suffer from seminal emission, you must treat it quickly. The most convenient and effective treatment is to take the German genuine old brand "Hymitos' Semen-Consolidating Tablets." This drug functions to consolidate the seminal vesicle and calm the nerves. After taking it, you can sleep peacefully and stop seminal emission on the same night. For those who have seminal emission with the above-mentioned symptoms, they must also take "Reproduction Element," a preparation made from reproductive gland factors, to nourish the brain and kidneys, and to nourish the spirit and nerves, so that they can recover their perfect health in a short period of time. If patients can come to our clinic for diagnosis and treatment in person, a cure can be guaranteed.</p>

<p>Maintain Leukorrhea That Never Returns</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is a venereal disease that is generally dreaded by people, because this virus is ten thousand times more difficult to treat than diseases such as syphilis and chancroid. Taking syphilis as an example, effective drugs such as "606" and "914" have now been invented, so this fierce syphilis is no longer a concern. The only disease that still lacks an effective drug is gonorrhea, which is why so many people suffer from it. Is it any wonder that acute and chronic leukorrhea is spreading in society? In fact, with the progress of modern science, the treatment of gonorrhea has been truly resolved. Those doctors who cling to old methods and use crude and inferior medical equipment and rough surgical procedures to muddle through and collect fees will never be able to rid people of the virus. Complications will arise, causing infertility and ending lives. This is mostly the result of patients with gonorrhea who have been improperly treated.</p>
<p>For more than ten years, I have served as the director of the gonorrhea department in major venereal disease hospitals in China. I have paid close attention to the progress of modern gonorrhea treatment. The filter lymph equal flow electrotherapy recently invented in Germany has truly opened a new era in the treatment of gonorrhea. In my years of clinical experience, all general acute and chronic gonorrhea, such as anterior urethritis, prostatitis, seminal vesiculitis, orchitis, arthritis, cystitis, and proctitis, are treated with filter lymph equal flow electrotherapy. I also use surgery and the latest chemotherapy as appropriate, and inject German Hee's gonorrhea serum intravenously. I also use a suspensory to support the inflamed and swollen testicles and order the patients to rest quietly. Following this treatment, it can be completely cured in a short period of time. After recovery, the patient will send the sample to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department for testing, and there will be no gonococcus, so it can guarantee a permanent cure.</p>

<h3>Old Newspaper Excerpts Sixty-seven Years Ago (From This Newspaper in the Twelfth Year of the Tongzhi Reign of the Qing Dynasty)</h3>
<p>Zhong Kui Scares a Thief</p>
<p>On the 23rd of last month, after three drums, in the home of a scholar in Xu Lane outside the old Chang Gate, everyone was asleep. The scholar was sitting alone in a high building, reading by lamplight. Suddenly, he heard someone on the floor, cried out in alarm, and fell to the ground. He immediately took a candle and went to look. He saw a thief lying unconscious in the corner, his limbs cold, but still breathing. He quickly woke him up and asked him what had happened. The thief said that he had just climbed over the wall and entered the room. He lit a fire to look around and suddenly saw a giant with a red face, vermilion beard, red clothes, and crimson boots, raising his hand as if to strike him. He did not know if it was a god, a ghost, a demon, or a monster. Now he knew it was a painting. It turned out that the scholar had a painting of Zhong Kui in cinnabar. Because a student had splashed water on the painting, it was hanging on the wall that day to dry. The thief was guilty and timid, mistaking the false for the real, and his soul was frightened away.</p>
<p>A Giant Turtle Bites a Foot</p>
<p>Zuo Qiuming's Zuo Zhuan says that Zigong tasted turtle flavor with his index finger. This is a unique event in history. But yesterday, a poor man in Shanghai was washing his feet under the railway bridge when he felt something biting his foot painfully. He looked quickly and saw a turtle as big as a dou (a unit of volume). Passersby helped him catch it and sent it to the Hongkou police station. It weighed over one hundred and fifty catties, which can be considered gigantic. But his foot was injured, and he only saw the shape of the turtle. How does his suffering compare to the pleasure of one who tasted turtle flavor with a finger that moved?</p>
<p>Great Earthly Light</p>
<p>After midnight on the 27th of last month, fishermen on fishing boats on the shores of Tai Lake suddenly saw a light on the water reaching the sky. There were no sun, moon, or stars, but it was clear as day. Beards and eyebrows could be seen distinctly. The fishermen thought it was dawn and were about to prepare their boats, but soon it was dark as before. Several hours later, the sun rose brightly. No one knew what omen this was.</p>

<h3>Motion</h3>
<p>— Huang Xiyin</p>
<p>Motion, because this is a world in motion.</p>
<p>A few hundred years ago, the snail's pace could be used to symbolize the world's motion. Today, only airplanes and lightning can represent the speed of the world's motion.</p>
<p>In a classroom at a university, after the renowned history professor Gao Deshao finished lecturing, a dozen eager young people crowded around the podium. "Professor, please tell us your opinion on the left and right wings." The professor replied, "Are you left-wing or right-leaning?"</p>
<p>The professor stroked his gray beard and smiled.</p>
<p>"Young people," he said, "left and right are not very clear classifications. Besides left and right, there are two other tendencies in the world: one is forward, progressive, and the other is backward, outdated. I only hope to be someone who moves forward and progresses. Because," he said, forcefully turning the globe on the table, and the globe spun. Then he continued, "Because the world is in motion, it is always progressing."</p>
<p>This beloved old professor may have been avoiding our question, but his words gave each of us a very deep impression and instruction. Motion, because the world is in motion.</p>
<h3>Nurse's Self-Narration</h3>
<p>— Self-Study</p>
<p>A formal nurse must go through three stages. The first stage is a trial reading year, the second stage is three years of student life, and finally, after passing the nurse association examination, a diploma is issued. Only then is one considered a formal nurse who can serve in any hospital in the country. During the three years from the trial reading to becoming a formal nurse, the working hours in the ward gradually increase from two hours to eight hours. Working in the ward mainly involves tasks such as emptying spittoons, cleaning bedpans, making beds for patients, wiping bodies, and dispensing medicine. Therefore, rather than saying it's three full years of ward work, it's more straightforward to say it's being a nanny for three full years. In the eyes of the general public, patients call you "Miss" or "Miss Smith," but our actual status is no different from that of servants in an ordinary mansion!</p>
<p>In this isolated island where domestic wars are raging, it can be said that there are very few ways for women to acquire a skill that will enable them to be self-sufficient in the future and not be parasites on others and society. Especially for women like us, whose hometowns have fallen and whose further education is practically impossible, there is an added layer of perilous difficulties! Last summer, after a period of hard work, I was admitted to a senior vocational nursing school for women. At that time, out of one or two hundred people, only thirty were admitted. The family's hopes and my personal inner joy at securing one of those positions could not be described with a single pen. Hope turned into reality. I paid the tuition and fees, put on the nurse student uniform, and because it was the trial reading stage, I was not yet qualified to wear a nurse's cap. For the four months I was in school, because the hospital's business was extremely good, and because we were young women, with only frankness and enthusiasm in our hearts, no matter how unreasonably the patients behaved, no matter how nitpicking and severely reproachful the head nurse was, I always remembered the saying, "Endure the bitterest of the bitter, and you shall be above others." So, at that time, all the physical and mental fatigue caused by the labor, the resentment in my heart caused by the reprimands from the head nurse, who considered herself to be experienced, was endured with a firm will of twelve points, embracing the spirit of "bearing humiliation and working hard silently." Because I idealized that a person's life is inherently a winding and uneven road, and that the "freedom" and "happiness" after acquiring a skill are an inevitable stage.</p>
<p>Time flew by like an arrow, and the half-year trial reading passed quickly. The semester final exams arrived. Relying on the skills I had learned through self-study, despite the appearance of being taught by teachers but without the substance of it (because generally, high-status doctors don't want to teach, but they can't justify it in their duties, so they reluctantly take on the role, so most of the time they only assign self-study materials and rarely lecture). Fortunately, I didn't fail any subjects (70 points required to pass). Four classmates were asked to withdraw from school because they failed two subjects, and another classmate was asked to withdraw because she failed one subject and still failed the makeup exam (in fact, the semester notification only stated that students who failed two subjects during the trial reading period would be asked to withdraw, and there was no regulation about being asked to withdraw for failing one subject and then failing the makeup exam). When those classmates parted with us, the sorrowful expressions on their faces made us shed a few tears of sympathy!</p>
<p>From more than thirty classmates, the number had been reduced to more than twenty. Naturally, we were all extra cautious while doing ward work. Unfortunately, one classmate was caught by the doctor with an orange on her bed and was called to the principal and punished with a one-month cap suspension (nurses who violate the rules are punished by not being allowed to wear their nurse's caps in the ward). The principal even said in a ferocious tone, "You are not yet qualified to wear caps. You will face many more setbacks in the future!" A layer of panic was added to my heart. I didn't know what kind of encounters my future fate would bring...</p>
<p>I hope that the school's principal, doctors, and head nurses can all fulfill their duties, act according to their conscience, lead by example, and guide students with respect for their personality. Who is without fault? We came here to "learn," so how could we not make small mistakes? The methods of punishment might as well be more lenient! I also hope that with a broad and far-sighted vision to increase talent in the medical field and wash away the shame of being the "Sick Man of East Asia," they can be more forgiving of our limitations in intelligence, labor, and mental strength. I hope that they can give more consideration to changing the practice of not notifying parents of the school's disciplinary rules in advance, but suddenly imposing punishments, even to the point of ordering mid-term withdrawal, so as not to cause excessive stimulation and terrible accidents!</p>
<p>Psychology</p>
<h3>The Psychology of Youth</h3>
<p>— Song Jinglian</p>
<p>The psychology department of the University of Arizona in the United States conducted an interesting test. According to their findings, intelligence does not help girls attract men, but only helps them get good grades in school.</p>
<p>The test also advises girls to put more effort into the art of social interaction, entertaining, recreation, and games if they want to gain the love of men.</p>
<p>This test was the result of the collaboration of over fifty students in one class. They also said that the results of this test not only apply to women, but also to men.</p>
<p>Dr. Hatton, head of the psychology department at the school, found it most surprising that the art of social interaction, entertaining, and recreation was the most important element in attracting men, while intelligence was only listed as the last of the eight most important elements in attracting men. Dr. Hatton also said that the results of this test have completely overturned the theory that male students prefer women with high intelligence as their life partners.</p>
<p>Dr. Hatton concluded optimistically, saying: "The most important conclusion of this test is that most of the good qualities of celebrities in society can be obtained by anyone, as long as they are willing to work hard to study and improve. At the same time, if you are willing to work hard on makeup, demeanor, conversation, etc., most of our shortcomings can also be eliminated." We only hope that his conclusion is correct and that lovers in the world will become family members.</p>

<h3>Tomorrow, Today</h3>
<p>— Li Li</p>
<p>I know that eight years ago, someone planned to read some books—when he had time. However, he still hasn't turned a page to this day, and naturally, he never will. His ambition has been strangled by the hand of procrastination.</p>
<p>We shouldn't look for excuses to postpone what we should do today until tomorrow. Otherwise, everything will become a bubble. What a fool to waste today's reality and place hope in tomorrow's illusion! But there are many people like that.</p>
<p>"Let's talk about it tomorrow." How familiar these words are. But, please remember that although today is only twenty-four hours long, tomorrow is infinite. Then, I'm afraid it will inevitably remain an empty word forever?</p>
<p>You can't separate yourself from the present and focus solely on how tomorrow will be. Whether you like it or not, you will always live in the present.</p>
<p>Therefore, the core of the problem is to live. In the daily life of the real world, you will learn the knowledge of how to live. It is like a magical key that can unlock the treasure of tomorrow's happiness—when time pushes tomorrow to the present.</p>

<h3>Nine Arhats</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xun</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from Kunshan, of the Arhats in Baosheng Temple in Jiaozhi, only four remain. However, it is still difficult to ensure their preservation sooner or later. This antique is indeed a rare historical site in Southeast China, but unfortunately, the Chinese people do not pay attention to it. Although the local authorities once jointly took custody and renovated it, few Chinese people visit it. But the Japanese visit almost every free moment, having long coveted it. According to records, these Arhats were sculpted by Yang Huizhi, a disciple of Zhang Sengyao during the Tang Dynasty's Yuanhe era. They are now more than 1,400 years old. Baosheng Temple was founded during the Tianjian era of Emperor Wu of the Liang Dynasty (503 AD), rebuilt during the Song Dynasty's Xiangfu era, and renovated again during the Ming Dynasty's Chongzhen era.</p>
<p>Huizhi originally sculpted eighteen Arhats, which are described in detail in the Fuli Zhi. Fuli is the ancient name of Jiaozhi, named after the poet Lu Guimeng, the Master of Fuli. Of the Arhat statues currently in the temple, there were originally nine, but one was stolen, so only eight remain. One has a curly beard and python robe, looking up, called Subduing Dragon, which is the most divine. Another has an angry look, bare belly, stretching out his arm and pinching a phoenix, called Taming Tiger. The one in the center sits quietly with his eyes closed, resembling an emperor, said to be Emperor Wu of Liang. One has a clear and beautiful face, opening his mouth to laugh. One has a clear and handsome face, one strong and one thin, with different emotions. The latter is solemn and majestic. Therefore, each of the eight statues has its own distinct personality, containing affection, truth, and fullness within them, which is difficult for non-sacred sculptors to express. The exquisite craftsmanship of the sculptures is evident. However, the Chinese people have always neglected it, leaving this great historical site desolate. In 1918, the scholar Gu Dunyou visited, and revisited a year later, finding them almost submerged. He then appealed for their preservation, publishing in the Short Story Monthly. Consequently, the East Asian art historian Omura Seigai traveled thousands of miles to photograph eighteen images in detail, providing detailed citations, and compiling the book "Remnants of Wall Sculptures," which caused a sensation among art historians in various countries, who came to study them. Later, thanks to Mr. Cai Yuanpei's writings and appeals, a preservation association was organized, with Mr. Wang Zhongjian organizing the remnants. The gate outside the temple is shaped like a paifang, with the four characters "Fu Yang Secret" written by Qianlong.</p>
<p>Besides Baosheng Temple, other remnants that still exist include Ke chessboards, plinth foundations, tile cylinders, and animal head ornaments, which are all now in the Jiaomin Education Hall. As for the statues sculpted by Yang Huizhi, in addition to the Arhats in Baosheng Temple, there is also said to be a Heavenly King statue in Huiju Temple in Kunshan.</p>

<h3>"Son of Mongolia" Completed Filming</h3>
<p>— Qiu Wen</p>
<p>I remember that in the autumn of 1935, a surprising piece of good news came: the Soviet government had decided to assist the Mongolian Republic in producing a national defense film, "Son of Mongolia." At that time, some people might be surprised, how could the Mongolians think of making a movie? In fact, if we observe from another perspective, we certainly know that it was caused by the Soviet government's inducement. Although the Mongolians have been invisibly threatened and exploited by the Soviet government, the handling of the entire plot is said to indeed not lose the meaning of a national defense film. Throughout the film, it clearly tells the Mongolian people how they should rise up to resist the invasion and trampling of third countries, and it further tells the Mongolian people what methods they should use to deal with future enemies.</p>
<p>The content of the script is indeed very bold. The entire play, in addition to depicting the unique romance of the Mongolian people, is almost entirely a demonstration against a certain country. It tells us how a certain country oppresses the Mongolian people in Mongolia, treating them like Koreans, and finally illegally robs them of several special trades of the Mongolian people. Really, we feel that the oppressed nations should be awakened for people all over the world to pay attention to and jointly save these poor nations. However, if we observe from another perspective, then why doesn't a certain country also produce a film in Mongolia to expose their conspiracy? This is of course because it is beyond the reach of the Soviet Union! It is said that the plot of this film was written by the Soviet government, and almost all the leading actors were Mongolian. As for those who play the people of a certain country, part of them are Soviet actors. The entire film's exterior scenes were mostly filmed in Mongolia, while the interior scenes, washing, and editing were all handled by the Soviet Union. The entire film is also in Mongolian with sound dialogue. Recently, a certain Soviet newspaper praised this film as a representative masterpiece of a national defense film produced by the Chinese government. However, what I want to tell the readers is that this gift commemorating the 20th anniversary of the Mongolian Republic—Son of Mongolia—is not available here, because they don't need us to see it and increase our innate resentment. Therefore, the author dare not rashly judge what the content of this film is.</p>
<h3>Talking about "Goodbye, Mr. Chips"</h3>
<p>— Hua Erzhi</p>
<p>"Goodbye, Mr. Chips" was selected as the champion of the top ten blockbusters last year, and won the Academy Award for Best Picture. When it was released in the United States, its box office revenue was not inferior to any blockbuster in Hollywood history. In the United Kingdom, it was simultaneously screened in four first-run theaters, playing to full houses for two weeks. Now, the Grand China Theater is scheduled to release it starting today. The author of "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" is James Hilton. He liked to submit articles to newspapers during his school days. His first work was published in the Manchester Guardian when he was only seventeen years old. After graduating in London, he did not find a job, because he was friends with the editor of the Irish Independent, so he often wrote a little to make a living. In 1931, he wrote "Lost Horizon," which gave him a little status in the literary world. As for the motive for writing "Goodbye, Mr. Chips," a magazine editor asked him for a novella, to be submitted within two weeks. The first week passed, and Hilton had not yet started writing. Perhaps due to environmental reasons, he wanted to take a trip, even if he had to give up the稿費 of this novel. But before he set off, suddenly, "inspiration" descended on his desk. A character like Mr. Chips was produced under his pen. Within four days, he completed this masterpiece ("Goodbye, Mr. Chips," the original name of "Goodbye, Mr. Chips")</p>
<p>The author did not have the opportunity to read his original work, but I happened to see the "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" that Sam Wood put on the screen. Mr. Chips, who suddenly jumped to Hilton's pen, is a teacher who has dedicated his life to education, and is also a very lovely character. However, he is only "devoted" and nothing more. He did not create a scholar with great contributions to education or academia for Mr. Chips, which inevitably diminishes this masterpiece. At the same time, the embellishment of romance, as seen on the screen, also seems to be "an inserted passage, which is at least not very harmonious in the whole story." Because it is a masterpiece and a blockbuster, I hope this personal opinion will not be considered too demanding.</p>
<p>As for Robert Donat's Mr. Chips, from youth to old age, he fully grasped the special character of this character. His performance of the sincere joy when he met Greer Garson's abnormal state and saw the growth of the third generation of students is so divine that it is difficult to find another in Hollywood's group of young actors. The makeup is very lifelike, and the director's technique is also simple and vivid.</p>
<p>Recently, the competition of literary films and legendary films in Hollywood is indeed a gratifying phenomenon, and the awards of "You Can't Take It With You" and "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" fully prove the mission undertaken by movies. The costume films of domestic films seem to have a tendency to decline. Yesterday, this magazine's "suggestion" hopes that those engaged in film will be aware of this.</p>

<h3>Hollywood Male Stars on "Women"</h3>
<p>— Sheng Yi</p>
<p>James Stewart said: "I don't think the attraction that women give to men lies in coquetry and appearance."</p>
<p>Allan Jones said: "If women treat love as a magic-like pretense, then I'd rather read a romance novel."</p>
<p>Fred MacMurray: "Besides the other reasons, we need women just as we need a good listener."</p>
<p>George Raft: "When men are troubled, they need the love of the opposite sex to inspire them."</p>
<p>Errol Flynn: "Women should all know that the thing men hate most is a gossip."</p>
<p>Fredric March: "Modern women don't take men seriously, they are very arrogant. In fact, this is not their cleverness, on the contrary, it is their stupidity."</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Saintly Hands of Southern String and Percussion (Part 1)</p>
<p>When discussing the string and percussion accompaniment in Peking opera, everyone respects Mei Yutian, Sun Zuochen, and the famous drummers Li Wu and Liu Shun. The above-mentioned people are indeed exceptionally skilled and extraordinary. However, without Tan Xinpei's illustrious title of "King of Kings," which shook the world, the string players and drummers who assisted him would not have been deeply noticed by the music circle and enjoyed great fame. Because Tan only began to stand out after the age of fifty, astonishing everyone with a single feat. His experience was already rich, and his experience was also deep, and his own true artistic ability was also tempered and honed from hardship. Therefore, his selection of supporting actors was extremely strict, and even more so for the leaders of the string and percussion sections who accompanied him day and night. The so-called vision of a famous artist is naturally a cut above others, and those with mediocre skills are difficult to even be glanced at by him. Mei and Li followed Tan first, while Sun and Liu followed next. In his later years, Xu Lanyuan and Zihe also tried to be employed by Tan, but it was only for a very short time, and their skills were far inferior to Mei, Li, Sun, and Liu. Moreover, in the past, people in the percussion section first had to be proficient in all six types of accompaniment, and be proficient in everything, in order to be qualified, unlike today's so-called famous string players, who are only good at the zither, and the flute and suona are not what they have learned, let alone the gongs and drums and other instruments in the martial arts section. Yutian was indeed proficient in all six types of accompaniment and especially excelled at it, but when he followed Lao Tan to Shanghai, he was still humble and respectful, deeply afraid that there would be famous performers in the South, and if his skills were even slightly above his, and someone pointed out his weaknesses, then his past reputation would be swept away. Therefore, after arriving in Shanghai, he inquired of fellow artists in the same troupe, hoping to get a visit from a famous artist. At that time, there was Zhao Songshou in Shanghai, who was the father of the famous martial actor Zhao Xiaolian and the grandfather of the famous Dan actor Zhao Junyu. Although he was famous in the world for his drums, he also compiled new dramas in addition to the six types of accompaniment, and the tunes he recorded were countless. When he was at home, he always held a pen in one hand and buried himself in front of the desk, looking like a writer. All kinds of drum scores and tune names were drawn into various shapes with colored pens and annotated to spread widely among people. As for the old scripts he collected and the new scripts he compiled by hand, they filled baskets and chests, piled up like mountains.</p>
