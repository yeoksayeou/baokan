<p>社評</p>
<h3>危險時期中之美國</h3>
<p>美國衆議員卡爾生氏，昨日在衆院軍事委員會詢問海軍部長諾克斯氏，謂「美國有無參加遠東戰爭之危險」？諾氏答以『在此危險時期，無人知之』云。如此問答，似無何種具體之新啓示：然美國政界權威之把握其堅定國策，有鑒於遠東局勢之嚴重，體認美國參加遠東戰爭之隨時有其可能，則於此問答而宣洩無遺矣。</p>
<p>美國之國策，是否於從事戰爭之外，猶有貫澈之方法？美國之權益，是否於從事戰爭之外，就有保持之力法？如曰無待戰爭，則切實之方法安在？如曰勢必戰爭，則適宜之時機安在？凡此疑問，求美國人士之間，殆有若干岐異之見解；至少至今日爲止，尙難獲得一致之答復。若居今日而企圖鼓勵美人一致主張立即參戰，或企圖脅誘美人一致主張放棄其權益而退出遠東，則必俱歸徒勞。據傳英國駐美大使爲撒退駐華英軍問題，訪晤美國國務院當局時，嘗就美國今後在遠東所應負之職責有所進言；當局冷然答以美國自有主意，無勞越爼代謀云；所傳未必恰如眞相，然美國國策旣極堅定，而美國一般習性與風尙，由自尊之觀念而深惡宣傳，鄙薄遊說，樂聞各種無甚論斷之見解而自爲論斷；則所傳美國務院當局之所冷然者，實屬美國之典型精神。即如海軍部長所以答復議員者，力避正面肯定之辭，亦得美國從政之三昧者也。蓋美國人士於威爾遜總統時代之參加第一次歐戰而獲勝，以迄十四原則之失敗，迄今猶所痛心；痛心之反動，爲孤立理論之抬頭；痛心之敎訓，爲一般態度之謹慎；而有眞知灼見之政治家。亦以有所殷鑒而於國際之所謂平行行動或集團行動，不但諱言之，且亦憚爲之，孜孜矻矻所朝夕致力而不懈者，秉所信，定取舍。提高實力，務策萬全，然後選擇最合理之途徑，最適宜之時機，按步就班，特力獨行以赴之而已。三年來美國對付遠東局勢之迭决舉措，罔不如此，可覆按也。</p>
<p>至於今後，美國有其最理想之標準，即至六年後之一九四六年時，大海軍增建計劃可告完成，可以同時應付太平洋與大西洋兩面之變局而無虞。然此非吾定目前危機之謂，復非必待六年而目則不能有所作爲之謂。在目前：備偉大之陸軍，以補海軍目前同時對付兩洋之不足，此美國政府所提強制兵役案之所由來也，此其一。在大西洋方面，雖同情英國而期望英國之不敗。然德義海軍力量遠遜美國，故英國即使不幸而失敗，德義在劇戰之餘，事實上對美國究亦不致遽作何種威脅行動；備不虞者，空中而已，陸上而已；此其二。在太平洋方面。美國直接間接已受威脅，彼海軍部長認爲旣人危險時期；安定太平洋者繫於海軍，故美國海軍之主力，留駐太牛洋；此其三。云何已受威脅？在夏威夷羣島者，美國既悉遠東第五縱隊之出沒羣島；在間島四周之他國代管各島者，美國既悉各島已設違約之軍事設備；在菲列賓羣島者，謂有政界中人，相率以結交强鄰爲其政治上之出路；凡此事實，皆暄騰於美國報章，而爲美國一般人士所耳熟能詳云。况以中國之遭受侵略，美國在中國之權益幾無所恃；所恃者，非中國抗戰勝利，即美國發動實力以自維。復以法屬越南之被威脅，荷屬印度之被覬覦，此在氣勢上陷爲「東亞經濟圈」之一部份，誠使演爲事實，則介乎越南與荷印間之美屬菲列賓，必爲俎肉釜魚而無疑；而威脅之覬覦之者，目前旣昌言不諱於向此事實竭力推進，其事實跡象固歷歷可覩也。於是言之：「危險時期」確已降臨，美國國策之貫澈，權益之保持。非迅籌切實方法，則所謂「參加遠東戰爭之危險」無復否定餘地；「無人知之」者，時機而已。</p>
<h3>諾克斯海長宣稱　美注視兩洋危機　擴充海軍須六年完成　卽建三處後備根據地</h3>
<p>華盛頓　海軍部長諾克斯上校、昨吿衆院軍委會稱、渠相信一旦英國失敗、美·德衝突或將開始、渠預料英國戰敗後、德國卽將向南美作經濟之伸張、苟德國在拉丁美洲獲得軍事據點、則事態之嚴重、將不易解決、諾克斯上校拒絕答覆一直接之關於美國有否向日本作戰可能之問題、但稱、余以爲吾人現正生存於一甚危險之時代、無人能預言攻擊來自何方」、渠並言、現時有一危險之可能、卽「吾人在太平洋之可能敵人、或將與吾人在大西洋之可能敵人成立諒解」是也、此種聯盟或能侵害美國渠並宣言、「如吾人現時有三百萬噸之海軍、則毫無疑問地吾人必能控制大西洋及太平洋、惟吾人正在擴張中之海軍、非至一九四六年不能完成」、諾克斯上校指出、英國如終至戰敗、德國將控制一切造艦工業、速率將遠較美國爲大，海軍部長並重申　之預算、謂美國需要正規軍隊三十萬人、並附以國防軍之提議、係在法國屈敗之前送交國會者云、渠言、二年前、渠自南美歸來、卽深信保衛美國唯一方法、在採用「半球防衛法、談及巴拿馬運河時、氏稱、「吾國對外最重要之聯絡係在國外地帶」、渠並云、渠會見德國犧牲巨量金錢、在巴西方面之亞馬遜河設立航空綫、最後稱、「余曾詢問其故、據稱、該航綫可使彼等自亞馬遜河上游於五小時內到達巴拿馬運河故也」、（十五日合衆電）</p>

<h3>華商粉廠業　遭受雙重困難　定麥每船須二三百萬元　外銷絕望日廠又復競爭</h3>
<p>本市華商麵粉廠業、近因原料中斷、被迫停車後、向恃該業直接供給之麵包切麵麵館餅饅各店、確曾發生一度恐慌、旋經廠商介紹其暫用內地粉與外粉後、風潮始見平歇、緣本市行號前定之新洋粉、已由維大洋行等分別裝到、而淪陷區廠粉每日有四五千包至萬包到申、本市日商各廠、亦加速生產、應消本客、故本市麵粉供應之民食問題、乃得暫吿解決、</p>
<p>銷路被奪</p>
<p>惟自滬變後、迭經困難而忍痛維持達三年之華粉廠業、則已見衰落、卽據該業自認從中國機製粉開始以來、未有遭受重疊困難如今日者、蓋目下北洋與東北銷區盡被外粉所佔、南洋則被封鎖本市亦有洋粉日粉淪陷區粉侵奪、而原料一項、國麥旣遭統制、又被攔阻、歷來粉廠全年營業僅恃新麥湧令者今乃完全絕望、</p>
<p>訂麥不便</p>
<p>雖尙有向外訂買洋麥一途、然以滙水奇縮成本極昂、每定一船之銀根又須二三百萬元之鉅、不獨經濟或虞不週、卽洋行多嫌風險、不敢接受、故月前只定妥二批、而洋行尙不肯担負沿途意外責任、且船期不能準確、最早一船近電須八月底後到申、然尙難深信、卽日商自訂自裝之一船、原定目下可到者、亦須延至下週方有確訊、</p>

<h3>港幫乘低購進　金價欲小又止</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤晤盤市况、始終平疲、雖多頭心思經營者居多、但事實上欲進猶豫、反使一般浮戶傾向出售、而匯市平靜、亦爲不易上漲之一因、晨初爲五千七百八十元、開後會低十元、嗣賴金號錢兌業曁港帮等驟購、高至五千八百零五元、後雖被另一錢兌業沽出所壓、但金銀號續吸殊猛、再挺達五千八百二十五元、聞斯時外匯微軟、午收前靜寂中、證券帮求售、致收市祇五千八百十二元、午後初市尙佳、迨經錢兌業銀號等吐後、降爲五千八百零三元、晚收爲五千八百零七元、較上日微跌一元、收後市勢略軟、退至五千八百元關邊、全天交易的二千兩以上、銀樓飾金未更、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤祇軋小一元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以匯兌續漲、美匯微鬆、且加某銀號撳價力賣、致開市做小二十八元、銀號出金號二十兩、爲五千七百八十元、嗣因某銀號仍滿懷賣意、再跌十元、銀號出錢兌業等五十兩、退爲五千七百七十元、旋幸港帮乘低暗中活動、且賴某金號亦代富商扒進、故不久卽回升三十五元、金號進銀號三十兩、昂爲五千八百零五元、此後另一錢兌業突來吐塞、曾再小達五千七百九十元、惟終因錢兌業銀號曁金號等羣起代客收買、且浮戶不乏拖入、一度抬至五千八百二十五元、斯時成交尙旺、而未幾銀號及證券帮忽乘高塞出、且浮多獲利亦作了結之舉、收盤前曾回小至五千八百元、此價頗易吸收、入後銀號轉賣爲買、而浮多亦了結罄盡、故收市尙吿五千八百十二元、午後開市景况頗佳、首由金號進銀號十兩、升爲五千八百十八元、嗣又漲二元、銀號進金號十兩、爲五千八百二十元、旋乃某銀號湧塞、步小十餘元、銀號出金號十兩、降爲五千八百零三元、入後某錢兌業補空及證券帮買入、復又升起四元、銀號進金號二十兩、爲五千八百零七元、作晚收價、（收後人心略軟、錢兌業賣出頗多、遜爲五千八百元、惟成交少數、）結果比上日軋小一元、全天五十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金仍懸六百元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、終日未見更動、大同行仍懸六百元原價、新同行與上價相同、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>鮮票行市日下</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤平穩、英美金鎊故亦無甚榮辱、英金票供求均勻、市價平穩、美金票變動至微、最低爲十八元二角四分、最高爲十八元三角九分、卒爲十八元三角半、結果與上日相若、香港票稍有供給、市價略低一分、日余票需要仍殷、晚市爲一元三角六分半、朝鮮票情勢益非、大有江河日下之勢、晚市已退與法幣平掉、</p>
<h3>證劵　內債需要大盛　公和祥碼頭派息</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤、咋市漲風漸勁、觀連日中孚新華等各銀行不斷收進、不無蛛絲馬跡可尋、是則籌碼出路增加不爲無因、檯面籌碼已有顯著之枯竭、而需要仍尙殷切、上海防軍會議、聞已和平解決、租界治安、絕無問題、時局前途、已有慢性的澄淸朕兆、公債需要、自更逐漸增加、觀昨日聯和恒孚始終買進、聯益淮胃亦不弱、信孚需要亦殷、久豐漸起補空、樂茂搜羅甲種近十二萬、惟同康及鴻康兩家、始經賣出、永康及天豐賣出甲種、空方一面抵補、一面又在拋出、趨勢如此、而市價極爲堅强、故全日結果、續漲二角至六角半不等、甲種價出六十元、丙戊穿出五十元、又見付息後之新高價、成交總數、共計約九十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交三友實業社股二十股、價爲二十元〇五角、</p>
<p>衆業公所昨日股市、寗靜已極、整個市面、似在等待各國防軍會議之結果、價格幾無變動、成交極稀、空氣尙覺樂觀、</p>
<p>倫敦十四日（週三）電、今日中國外債及速東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、均吿平滯、行情概無變動、</p>
<p>恰和洋行經理之英商公和鮮碼頭有限公司、定八月二十九日開派一九四〇年度中期股息、每股國幣十七元、</p>
<h3>糧食　存米豐富　米價自平</h3>
<p>洋米市自前日一經轉軟後、昨則更演較猛之跌風、蓋以邇來到貨不絕、存底愈厚、各棧已有八九十萬包、市面挫折可虞、買方鑒於往昔之驟風巨浪、不獨內地帮及本鄕店胃一般實銷、穩紮穩打、僅應所需、卽浮囤散戶等心思交易、素抱投機活動之旨、遇高則進、見疲思出、茲悉祗縱不擒、所以市面出多進少、先徘徊而後直趨下降、其收盤行情、較之前市貶落一元左右、市上旣有大量存底、而來源迄未中止、且平糶又將開辦、棧存亦天熱求脫、實銷依然被阻、囤戶納胃呆滯、全日現米交易祗有二千六七百包、一號陳西貢祇開五十七元三角、新五十五元六角、二號五十三元至五十二元三五角、小絞五十二三元、暹邏二號祗五十一二元、比之前市又小一元至一元半、回籠原包初以客囤兩呆、開價卽小半元、旋有原根收補、市氣轉定、二號西貢六十二元一二角、二號暹邏六十二元二角、又建源原根六十二元六角、總計成交有四五百噸、</p>
<p>糯米去路亦屬不爽、不過市上高貨缺乏、所以貨主不肯輕脫、在扳持之下、行情僅小半元、其中關者則落近元、開金溧特元六十一元半、六十一元、常丹貨五十八九元、香港特元五十九元、中五十七元、次砶元五十二三元、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米到貨續到千餘包、所以際此洋米疲跌之間、傳聞塲外暗市相隨不振、甩低元半左右、常帮鮮淸粳六十六七元、無錫淸粳六十五元、常州蘇崑六十三四元、决至宿六十一二元、薄稻無市、南港原包鮮早稻六十二三元、斛見六十元五十九元、蕪尖四十七元六角云云、</p>
<p>周浦新粳、則以到貨突寥、遂不以胃口平常而見軟、獨呈定局、仍開六十二元、六十一元半、</p>
<h3>本街實銷　大部配用日廠粉</h3>
<p>現粉市况、均趨平穩、查福新廠以原料中斷、被迫停車後、阜豐廠續有供應、而本街實銷幫、大部份配用日粉與內地粉、故現粉迄未匱乏、更傳北洋幫裝粉被扣之謠、雖非證實、而人心已難過好、華粉廠盤、仍站十五元、日粉鳳凰牌價亦轉定、計開本月份十四元六角至六角二分半、九月份十四元六角半、洋粉價亦無甚榮辱、統市各粉成交、約計六千包左右、</p>
<p>麥市交易、平淡如故、內地來源、到貨不湧、存棧各貨、均有待價而沽之意、惟終以運入租界之困難、任憑日廠之挑剔、其價格仍站二十元左右、一時無法再昂、聞日廠需胃頗佳、而貨方亦不願輕脫、故成交數不過三千餘包云、</p>
<h3>紗花　新買束手　紗價日非</h3>
<p>紗市續跌、趨勢依然軟弱、此因現銷不暢、客胃殊滯、且一方面廠方催緊出去、所以人心不振、新買者又吿束手、至於大戶鑒於如斯情形、亦抱旁觀態度、暫時不來做作、均係一般乏力之浮日元、在市搶帽子交易、進進出出、熱鬧非凡、然市盤愈弄愈小矣、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、塲上依然散漫乏勁、且搶帽子之流及金子輩皆抱做短綫主義、大家抬高後想套出、二十支雙馬開價爲九百二十六元、此價一開、買者仍屬寥寥、形勢殊滯、旋聞實銷冷淡、賣氣尤盛、市盤徐徐下落至九百元、查半日間成交統計一千八百三十包、行情二十支雙馬跌三十元、今日有紗五百五十五件運香港、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>同行一、五七〇　香港二五〇</p>
<p>內地一〇　統計一、八三〇</p>
<h3>棉市暗淡</h3>
<p>現棉交易仍屬寂寞、各方皆無進展之望、實因紗價日非、廠方意態冷澹、所以原棉絕少生望、至於海外棉市、因德國加緊進攻、局勢亦在易跌難漲中、本棉行情、大致在萎靡之途耳、</p>
<p>三餘花一八四·　同行進一八九包</p>
<p>火機草包一五五·同行進二〇〇包</p>
<p>米特林二五八·公大進一〇〇件</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐約棉市市况呆滯、同業抱觀望態度、市况因現貨交易之淸淡、棉價轉形疲乏、結果收盤價格、較之上日跌落一二磅音、印度連同預測跌半羅比餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、終因紗價之不振棉市因之被拖而不前、前途竟有如紗價之同樣暗淡也、全日竟無只包之交易、</p>
<h3>疋頭　布廠增棧租　浮多心思動搖　東疋跌風未已</h3>
<p>布市續疲、蓋以銷路狹仄、棉紗軟弱、廠方催提棧單貨、猛增棧租費、浮多心思頗受動搖、售盤粗布·細斜·細布等貨續跌每疋二角半、漂染布跌三五角、本街成交三百餘件、浙幫辦粗布·色布·色斜一百餘件、粵港幫辦色布·色斜等一百數十件、國外星加坡等地辦漂布、色斜等貨四千餘疋、十五日運香港疋頭四百八十五件、</p>
<p>東布跌風未已、十二磅龍頭細布晨開三十一元八角、賣戶踴躍、直綫下降、後市低盤曾見三十元九角、收盤稍回昂、爲三十一元二角、四君子嗶嘰去勢允疲、一度跌至八角九分半、收市時爲九角、而人氣衰頹、暫時殊乏好面、</p>
<h3>油市　食油反動回昂</h3>
<p>近日油市、因產地行情戰跌、所以影響申市人心、市况連跌三朝、昨晨初尙見出多進少、開盤價比上日市仍削一元多、後因一般囤戶心思活動、趁賤拖進、貨戶乘機拉抬、市風轉好結果復砌元譜、成交膠州生油三百件、價爲六十二元五角至六十三元、路貨七百五十件、價爲六十二元五角至六十四元、靑島生油二十桶、價爲九十三元五角、大連豆油二十桶、價爲九十七元、大有餘廠豆油三百担、價爲七十元至七十五元、</p>
<p>又豆子今日有八百二十包、運往香港、</p>
<h3>糖市　晋江糖無來申之望</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢續見微緊、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白無甚上落、爲七十二元四角、外棧貨初平後緊、結果好起二角、爲七十二元至七十二元二角、轉口貨二十二日交貨仍爲五十六元七角、荷棉白見緊、TML三元三角、升三角、KD十二元、升五角、荷赤五十九元至五十九元四角、太古車白B七十五元三角、DY十二元六角、均無更動、H赤五十八元三角、升四角、國糖據晋江訊、因產價高昂、暫時絕無合划可能、決無運申之望、蓋該處由帆船運銷甌江較爲便利、而內地糖價甚高、亦一原因也、</p>
<h3>煤炭　烟煤屑回漲</h3>
<p>烟煤屑各貨、月前自傾跌以來、銷路平淡、殊少起色、惟日來受塊煤漲價刺激、稍見回升、計開印度烟屑每噸一百七十五元、開平一號屑一百六十元、二號屑一百四十元、基隆屑一百二十元、以上均同業拆價、送到客戶、酌加盤子、</p>
<h3>五金　黑鐵坯子續高</h3>
<p>黑鐵坯子市面、最近因外匯再縮、人心隨昂、故趨勢頓易舊貌、兼之前昨由天津幫客商羣趨問津、本街水瓶廠·鏡子廠·印刷廠·及製聽廠等、亦時有搜辦故市塲空氣熱鬧、執貨者心思挺秀、行情較前繼長增高、刻市每紥喊價須一千一百元、比之前市價昂數十元不等、查該貨日後若外埠客商大量採辦後、市價或有再好之望、</p>
<h3>南北貨　金山枝獻新　價開二百五十元　新金菜到稀回漲</h3>
<p>新金山枝因產價高昂、號方迄無到貨、近由行方試辦一十餘箱、業已到申、作爲試銷性質、昨聞已售開二百五十元、可謂空前之新紀錄、後批多到、當有回鬆可能、</p>
<p>徐州新金菜、前以到貨稍增、曾降去十餘元、但產價反見上展、自別路貨亦乏到、兼之粵汕兩幫均有問津、價回復緊、昨市售八十五元、特高者九十元、</p>
<h3>海味　烟台蝦尾到稀</h3>
<p>烟台蝦尾、邇來到源至稀、故底存有限、如龍鬚島貨曾叫三百三十元、擯持未成、始於昨日售開一批、爲三百二十六元、又成交安南田扁尾係冷汽貨、價爲三百二十元、大勢穩定、</p>
<h3>藥材　北芡存底單薄</h3>
<p>北芡卽藥芡、前市有港帮採辦、售價爲三十九元、近以來源轉寂、底存乃日感單薄、因之人心向昂、其稍有手貨者、亦不願廉脫、最近叫盤爲四十二元、殆不日將有成交、</p>
<h3>中國蠶絲業之刷新</h3>
<p>— 德</p>
<p>（甲）過去之槪况</p>
<p>我國蠶絲之輸出，過夫數年間卽呈顯著之减退；惟其减少之原因有二，其一爲製絲技術之缺陷，他方則係繭之品質的日行低下。尤以後者爲我國蠶絲業衰退之重大原因。二三十年之前，我國的養蠶家，自己尙有蠶種；且各地方皆能保持均一性。例如無錫地方有無錫種，諸曁地方有諸曁種，嘉興地方則有綠種等是，他如浙江，江蘇，山東，湖北，湖南，山西，等各省亦係同樣。此等地方之共通特徵，係能產出八至九，九至十一分那樣之細絲，並以均一性，彈力性等爲最優秀之點。</p>
<p>但此項事件，乃係十年至十五年之前，輸入外國種爲主嬰蠶種所受之變化。蓋此所輸入之蠶種，多比我國固有者惡劣；又因小規模之鄕村養蠶家，缺乏科學上之知識，一味盲從瞎幹，遂使繭之品質受到如斯重大之惡劣影響。結果，我國蠶絲在世界市塲上之地位，日形動搖，大有岌岌消滅之趨勢。</p>
<p>僅以蠶絲製造之惡劣，而謂必致喪失輸出市塲者，似屬過甚之辭。因我國之地域廣大，養蠶事業乃係人民之重要副業，故自然擁有多數之蠶種。在世界上，我國實可誇稱爲最豐富之製絲原料產地而無愧。且其蠶絲爲世界中之最優良者也。惜因過去缺乏精選及改良此最良之品種之組織，遂致如斯情况，故我國今日蠶絲業史生之道，實以回復蠶種品質爲第一緊要。（未完）</p>

<h3>議分馬頭費</h3>
<p>向　來鴉片烟土之進上海者，在英租　內由工部局收馬頭費，每兩計銀四錢，而在法租界者，則法工部局不收此費。局中經費，僅恃房租捐項，故有印度人新開烟行，特擇於法租界之內，原冀免此費也。而新沙遜相繼遷於法租界，迨今則老沙遜亦搬之而往，以故英租界工部局現於烟土馬頭費一項，竟至分厘無收。查此項通年亦收銀一二萬兩，今則遽少鉅款，辦公頗覺爲難，不知如何設法，可以抵補。英工部局特請法工部局商議，欲一律收此馬頭費，倘得允許，令土行仍遷回英租界，則所收之銀願分貼法工部局，每年五千兩，乃法局不肯允行，且云辦理收捐，各有章程，亦不能遽改云。</p>

<p>天熱得要命，北向的小窗中非但沒有絲毫的風吹進來，從柏油路上被蒸逼起來的熱氣反把這狹小的窗口組成了火網。在五支光的電燈下批閱課卷，汗像珍珠似的從額上，頰骨，頸　，而流到了胸前，用手巾來揩抹也沒有用處，却反而躭誤了我的工作。因爲在課卷改完之後，我至少要有幾小時的睡眠，才能恢復今天的疲勞，而明天繼續上課呢。於是忘記了目前一切的痛苦，把精神集中在課卷上。</p>
<p>也不知什麼時候了，望着一本本低下來的課卷，心頭似乎覺得陣莫名的寬暢，但窗口忽然飛進一隻飛蛾，向着電燈猛撲。五支光的電燈本來祇够照見紙面上的字影，這隻飛蛾的徘繞猛撲，就把它龐大的影子在課卷上移動，速字影都瞧不淸楚了；而且眼球受了刺激，有些暈眩了。這突來的糾纏逼使我停下了筆。但是這餘下來的幾本課卷如何處置呢？明天去欺騙那些天眞的孩子，還是犧牲自己的睡眠時間？急中想出了急的辦法，把電燈拉下來逼近自己的頭部，這樣，它的徘繞的影子果然並不影饗課卷上的字影，可是它徘繞猛撲如故，連我的面上，胸部都誤認作爲目標。在汗跡未乾的皮膏上粘着它翅上的毛粉，再也使人忍耐不住了，於是我　起殺心，把報紙在燈下摺了個紙袋，等着它自投羅網罷。</p>
<p>果然，它做了紙袋的俘虜，但還在里面使勁地飛撲。我因爲急於批改課卷，也沒有注意一下它掙扎的情形。等到一堆課卷完全看完，痛快地伸了一個懶腰，忽然覺窗外已露着肚白色了，一陣曉風掠過，這愉快的享受確是難以形容。這時我才記起這隻飛蛾，把紙袋拿下來一看，它已經用盡了它的精力，僵臥在袋里。</p>
<p>肚白色的天際漸漸明朗，五支光的電燈已失却了它的光芒，我才舒了口氣，熄了燈，躺到床上去，凉爽的曉風不時從窗口吹來，天明了。</p>
<p>業餘漫談</p>
<h3>正視經濟蕭條</h3>
<p>— 史偉</p>
<p>原來老早就有人指出過，上海的繁榮是靠不住的，這就是說，它並不是正常的發展。造成繁榮的原因，一方面是過去政府無限制的供給上海外滙，使上海成爲中國國外輸入的總站。其决是隨着各城市的失陷，上海的人口逐漸增加，特別是資金逃避，使上海這一隅之地集中了數十萬萬的游資，因而囤積居奇，投機賣買等層出不窮，其混亂情形眞是「破天荒」的。但無論如何，人們畢竟不難窺見這種表面繁榮的底細。物價高漲了四五倍，固然使各廠商獲得了鉅額利潤；但道是建築在數百萬市民生活空前惡化的基礎上面的。</p>
<p>由於歐戰的擴大影響到國外的輸入，由於海口封鎖影響到上海的輸出，由於某方的加緊控制，由於生活費用的增加迫使大批市民離滬，特別是由於工資跟不上物價高漲而造成購買力的普遍减落。所以從基本上講，上海的表面繁榮已走到了它的盡頭，接着的是向蕭條的路上奔跑。</p>
<p>報紙上已經在報吿驚人的新聞，六月份紗號倒閉了百餘家，七月份棉織廠停工的有十分之五，裁員减薪的有十分之三，剩下來祗有十分之二維持原狀；有許多化學工業廠已都開七日停七日，若干搪瓷鋼精廠已都停開夜工，各公司商號的營業數目的等於五月二日前的二分之一，上海商業的樞鈕—南京路上已有二爿中等襪廠與一家規模較小的國貨公司在舉行關店大拍賣了。</p>
<p>顯然，這是一個極端嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>由於廠商的倒閉與裁員，將使失業隊伍更加擴大，使市民生活更加惡化，迴轉過來就是使經濟蕭條更加嚴重；社會將引起不安、國力將受損失、惡勢力將進一步的緊迫與引誘</p>
<p>全上海的市民應該來注視這與己生活休戚相關的問題，租界當局及各界領袖望能積極來策劃解決辦法，各報紙雜誌應展開廣泛的討論。我們早已覺得這經濟蕭條會得到來，因之決不是向它低頭，而是迎頭去解決。問題的焦點是在能否同心協力，團結一致，為了祖國的前途，來渡過這個空前的難關。</p>
<h3>弄堂裏的大亨</h3>
<p>— 朱曦</p>
<p>我們弄堂里有個大亨」。</p>
<p>「大亨」這把交椅已經傳了好幾個人了，如今坐這把交椅的名叫小癩子，年紀大的十四五歲，有着很結實的身體，很大的力氣；當然這把交椅是打來的，因爲「前任交卸」之後，逐鹿的人很多呢！</p>
<p>小癩子手下還有幾　黨羽，這些都是弄堂中與他差不多人家的孩子，他們對小癩子是惟命是從的，當然最大原因是怕他拳頭厲害。那末小癩子可以在弄堂中隨便打人家的孩子，家長們就不管嗎？是的，這一定有人要問。不過你知道，小癩子有位很能幹的姊姊呢！有一次，小癩子又在弄中尋事打了人家的孩子，這孩子的母親去找小癩子的母親評理。好！他的姊姊出來了，她說；『小癩子被你們嚇跑了，你同我去把他找回來，我就叫媽媽打他。假使他不回來在外面出了什麼事，嘿！要你們負這個責任的。』接着又嘩啦嘩啦駡了一大串，人家駡不過她，只好算了。</p>
<p>小癩子自己還有好方法呢！他不親自動手打人，總是唆使他的黨羽打的，並且他們暗中的好，倘然誰打了人家鬧到自己的大人處去時，其餘的幾個就出來證明，說；『某人並沒有打他，是他瞎說的。』他們的組織似乎也很嚴密。</p>
<p>因爲家中僅有一間房，所以傍晚太陽升上屋頂之後，就打發孩子洗了澡在門口坐着乘凉，因此我們的二個孩子，也曾被小癩子和他的黨羽欺侮過，並且被奪去一些玩意兒和圖畫書。</p>
<p>有一個姓王的孩子，十一二歲了。有一回走出弄堂去，被小癩子和他的黨羽攔住了，要借一角錢買路，沒有，被打了幾拳哭着回家去。</p>
<p>上海眞是一個奇怪的地方，到處有奇怪的事發現。像小癩子這樣，他家中做什麼的我不知道，所可知道的一定沒有良好的家庭敎育，或許他道種舉動，家中還以爲得意，他姊姊的衛護就可以看出。並且，他平日所耳渲目染的和心目中所崇拜的偶像，恐怕就是所謂一大亨吧？</p>
<p>孩子有領袖慾，並不楚不好的心理，不過須有良好敎育來誘導他入於正途才對呢！</p>
<p>小癩子假使有良好的父兄及師長來敎導他，是一個很有希望的孩子。（却酬）</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第五章　惡消息</p>
<p>電話間却站了四五個人，在那裏喃喃地談話，內中還像有一個旅館的職員。我在向東面通則們的方向瞧瞧，也不見霍桑的影踪。余甘堂却已從向南的大門裏　　出去。我除追踪上去，當然沒有別法。</p>
<p>我暗自忖度道；「我可能把他拘住了交給警察？這舉動會不會壞事？霍桑也會贊成嗎？」</p>
<p>可恨的，我走到了門口，依舊不見霍桑。我向轉角的停車處一看。他的汽車也不見了。奇怪，他怎麼放我一個人在這裏？</p>
<p>我看見余甘棠跳上一部黃包車，把手向西揮一揮，我才安心了些。如果他有汽車的話，我也許會被迫探取緊急處置，把他拘住了再說。這時我的最合理的行動，當然也如法泡製地跳上一部黃包車，叫車夫向西進行。我與余甘棠之間還隔着兩輛其他的黃包車，那是我最好的烟慕。</p>
<p>車子向靜安路進行的時候，我仍向街的左右瞭望，希望霍桑會突然出現。效果當然是零。我一壁吸着紙烟，一壁推想霍桑突然失踪的理由。莫非他也在無意中碰見了趙伯雄，故而尾隨着他去了嗎？或是倪金壽還有什麽其他重要的報吿，霍桑才來不及等我，已趕到警察署裏去了嗎？或是—我的推想又到處碰壁。</p>
<p>黃包車進行了五六分鐘，便漸漸離開鬧市。等到走到河陽路時，那兩輛隔在中間的烟慕車，都不別而行地岔開了。我和余甘棠的車子便發生了直接的連繫。可是我仍叫車夫保持着若干距離。車子又向南轉灣，進入昌明路。余甘棠曾在車上回頭來瞧過一瞧，我急忙丟了烟尾，把頭一低，料想他不會瞧淸楚我。不過情勢上却很危險。又經過了三四分鐘光景，昌明路將要走盡，余甘棠的車子忽而停下來了。（七七）</p>

<h3>曹禺的「正在想」</h3>
<p>— 鄒嘯</p>
<p>曹禺以「雷雨」一劇一鳴驚人，獲得國際的地位，接着又作「日出」和「原野」，各地都上演他的戲。最近他的獨幕劇「正在想」脫稿，又已在辣斐劇塲上演了。</p>
<p>此劇編得很好，色彩允佳：別出蹊徑，與前三劇不同。吳堅演老倭瓜，簡直是在演「跪池」；凡看過「這不過是春天」中廳長這角色的，都知道他演技的超特。夏霞演小甜瓜，最爲合式，那聲音就够甜的，眞個是「小甜瓜，甜瓜小，」幾句悲調，「我的天哪」，轉折得允有神韻。魏征的老蓋兒幾句山東話，維妙維肖，一半當是導演許晟之功。梅邨的丁老師，活畫出一個只洗凈杯盤外面的僞善者。他如韓非演小禿子的天眞，英子演小紅的嬌態，維拉演領弟的快嘴，嚴俊演李保長的官派，等等，都使得這戲劇生色。雖說是喜劇，但寫藝術家的不被欣賞，其實却是含淚的微笑。因此，我想到最末在觀衆一哄而散以後，小甜瓜兜着圈子要打老倭瓜，老蓋兒等人跟着一同逃，也是這樣的熱鬧，不知是否掩沒了悲哀的激動。不過如果要改爲靜的塲面，小甜風只是又着手臂賣問老倭瓜，又不知是否會與以前熱鬧的塲面不調和，以致鎭壓不住這個結尾；或者說，使得這結尾鬆懈了。我對於話劇是外行，因此也不敢下一個斷語。</p>
<p>與「正在想」同時演出的是「啞妻，洪謨的導演使得這兩幕喜劇滑稽電影化，很是成功。例如歌唱與動作的配合，行手術者的點頭和動作的機械化，都極有趣。吳耐，小鳳，奚蒙等的熟嫻的演技，獲得了魄衆自始至終的笑聲。</p>
<p>聽說不久曹禺的「北京人」和「蛻變」兩劇也將在辣斐劇塲上演，我們等着瞧吧。</p>
<h3>讀「獻給評劇界的管見後」</h3>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>— 靜廬</p>
<p>讀子嘉君一篇「獻給評劇界的管見」大文後，使我感到無限的同情，的確，他所說的種種，也是我「數年來心中對於評劇界所想說的」話。現在一般評劇家所寫的「不是在捧，便是亂駡，」却從未負起他們應負的責任。</p>
<p>譬如平劇的需要改良，是人所公認的，但一般評劇家却堅持着非守舊不可，對於改良平劇攻訐備至，他們不但不鼓勵戲劇的改進，反而從中阻撓，至於在小處吹毛求疵，更是他們的慣技，像考籃與網籃之爭，索府與蘇府之戰，就是極顯明的例子，誰的對與不對，自然難逃公道，强詞奪理是沒有用的，可是評劇家的責任就在這個上面嗎？</p>
<p>所以子嘉君的意見很對，評劇家應該不要在小處吹毛求疵，或賣弄死人骨頭，而須從大的方面加以嚴格的指正，如劇情的意識（按，平劇向不注重意識，我却認爲是重要的一點。）和合理，劇本的結構和修詞，服裝的合乎時代，演技的修養和硏究都是評劇家應該一一商榷的，這纔不愧這三個字「評劇家」尊嚴的榮銜，我願附子嘉君的驥尾，向評劇界大聲疾呼，要求諸位改變作風！</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>— 吠聲</p>
<p>本刋本月七日披露了「獻給評劇界的管見」一文，讀了使我非常感動，因爲我是愛好戲劇的一員，平時要想從旁鼓吹，使之加以改進，可是我的志願，終不過是志願而已，要想實現，却非易事，第一是伶人們的墨守成規。舉一個例說吧，我曾經把「捉放曹」的改善意見，在去年本刋上發表，並曾與某伶說過，可是結果，任何人都置之不理，可見伶人們的保守性和固執性，實是最大原因之一。</p>
<p>第二，報章刊物，爲了種種關係，總是抱着「隱惡揚善」的態度，要是有很直率地指出某一伶人的大疵，或是矯正某一評劇文字的錯誤的作品，大　拒不發表。這裏我要貢獻一點意見給編者，最好文責由作者自負，一切麻煩，不無可以避免，不知編者先生以爲如何？（按）此點難以照辦。</p>
<p>第三要基於善意的批評，凡執筆爲文的評劇人，最基本的條件，是要完全以客觀的態度，作藝術的論據，就拿這個「評」字來講，左邊是言論之言，右邊是公平之平，必須要公平正直的言論，纔配被稱為評論。所以挾嫌嫉忌之謾罵，旣要不得，徇情阿私之瞎捧，亦無所取。</p>
<p>至於前進的伶人，對於劇情，服裝及唱詞，業經自動加以改良的，已是屢見不鮮，當然也有鼓勵的必要。</p>

<h3>Chinese Troops Achieve Victory on the West Bank of the Xiang River</h3>
<h3>Japanese Troops Cleared Out Near Jingmen</h3>
<h3>Japanese Attempt to Invade Chinese Positions Northeast of Dangyang Repulsed</h3>
<h3>Part of Japanese Troops Besieged in Funan Break Out and Flee, Chinese Forces Pursue Vigorously</h3>
<p>Fancheng: Chinese troops on the west bank of the Xiang River have been mopping up Japanese troops northeast of Jingmen, and have completely cleared out areas such as Lexiangguan (north of Jingdou) and Wangjiaji (northeast of Jingmen). On the 3rd, they launched another encirclement and attack on the Japanese troops northeast of Jingmen, stormed into the Japanese positions in one fell swoop, killed over 200 Japanese soldiers, and the remaining Japanese fled in disarray. The Chinese forces captured a large amount of military supplies. (Dispatch of the 15th)</p>
<p>Yicheng: A unit of Japanese troops near Dangyang advanced towards Chinese positions from the northeast of Dangyang on the morning of the 6th. They were met with a counterattack by the Chinese army, and the fighting was fierce. By noon, they were unable to withstand the pressure and retreated. (Dispatch of the 15th)</p>
<p>Guilin: The Japanese troops besieged in Funan have suffered heavy casualties due to repeated fierce attacks by the Chinese army. On the morning of the 13th, a unit of Japanese troops broke out towards Longtou, but were intercepted by the Chinese army, and the Japanese troops scattered in all directions. (Dispatch of the 15th)</p>
<p>Wuming: A certain unit of the Chinese army in southern Guangxi attacked the Japanese troops entrenched in Naliao (under the jurisdiction of Sileng) on the 2nd, and stormed into the Japanese positions in one fell swoop. The Japanese troops were unable to withstand the attack and fled. The Chinese forces recaptured Naliao. (Dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<p>Wuming: After the Chinese army in southern Guangxi captured Qijin County on the morning of the 6th, they immediately cleared the battlefield and crossed the river to launch a fierce attack on the Japanese strongholds west of Shangjin. The fierce battle continued until 6 p.m. on the 7th, when the Japanese troops showed signs of collapse. The Chinese forces are currently pressing the attack. (Dispatch of the 15th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to a Chinese military spokesperson, Chinese and Japanese troops are currently engaged in fierce fighting on the border of southern Guangxi. On August 5th, the Chinese army occupied Shangjin, ten miles east of Xizhou, and drove out all the Japanese troops stationed there. To date, the Japanese army has not been able to reoccupy the area. The Japanese attempt to defeat the Chinese forces on all fronts has been hampered by the heavy floods in many rivers around Longzhou and Shangjin in the past week. These floods were caused by heavy rains. The spokesperson further stated that, according to military intelligence, the strength of the Japanese troops in Nanning and Longzhou had decreased significantly in the past week. The reports that the Japanese army had increased its garrison in these two cities were not true. The spokesperson also stated that, in North China, the Japanese army has not only cleared the grass in the fields along the railway tracks to a width of one mile, but also built barbed wire fences on both sides of the railway to prevent guerrillas from sabotaging traffic. Despite these precautions, a military train traveling from Qingdao was blown up twice in the past week, killing two Japanese soldiers. The barbed wire fence still cannot prevent guerrilla sabotage of the railway. (United Press dispatch of the 15th)</p>
<p>Yingde: A certain unit of the Chinese army in southern Guangdong launched a surprise attack on the Japanese troops in Longkou at midnight on the 7th, once breaking through the Japanese barbed wire and burning down many Japanese barracks.

<h3>Winter Clothing Donation Campaign to be Completed by the End of This Year</h3>
<h3>National Winter Clothing Donation Committee Issues Circular Calling for Enthusiastic Donations from People at Home and Abroad</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The General Association of the National Winter Clothing Donation Campaign Committee, in view of the imminent arrival of autumn and winter, urgently needs to promote this year's winter clothing donation campaign. It has been previously stipulated that the national donation campaign will begin simultaneously on August 15th, and will be completed within two and a half months before October 31st. The Committee has now issued a circular to compatriots at home and abroad, calling for a unified response and enthusiastic donations. The circular states in brief: "The hot summer is about to pass, and autumn is approaching in the blink of an eye. Every year when winter comes, we are warmly dressed and do not feel cold even when sitting by the stove, while millions of soldiers on the front lines are braving the cold in the frozen wilderness to engage in fierce battles, and displaced refugees are shivering and crying out in the cold. Their loyalty and courage are admired by all, and their dedication to the country is sympathized by the world. Since the 27th year of the Republic (1938), this Committee has repeatedly called for and launched the Winter Clothing Donation Campaign to be transferred to the soldiers on the front lines and the refugees. We are deeply indebted to our compatriots at home and abroad for their generous donations and enthusiastic contributions. In the past two years, we have collected more than seven million pieces of winter clothing, which have been distributed one by one. In the past two summers, we have also sewn more than 300,000 sets of summer clothing made of ramie cloth and 80,000 mosquito nets, which have been distributed to new recruits and wounded soldiers in various places. This Committee has decided to continue to launch this year's Winter Clothing Donation Campaign. However, based on past experiences, we deeply feel that transportation is inconvenient in various places, and the distribution of winter clothing is difficult. It is also difficult to ensure the uniformity of quality and style for clothing made separately in various places. Therefore, this year, we have decided to change to raising 10 million yuan in cash (6 million yuan domestically and 4 million yuan overseas), and to collect as many old clothes as possible. Based on the actual needs of various battlefields, we will separately request the military supply bureaus in various places to make and transfer the clothing, and request the affiliated agencies of the Western Relief Committee to distribute the collected old clothes to refugees in various places for relief. The donation campaign will begin on August 15th and will last for two and a half months, and must be completed by October 31st. We hope that everyone will take the lead, publicize widely, and respond enthusiastically in accordance with the principle of contributing money and effort, and make large donations."

<h3>Japanese Army Vehicle Runs Over Chinese Landmine</h3>
<p>Miluo: A bridge (27 meters long), number 177, on the Yueyang-Puqi section of the northern section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway was blown up by a certain unit of the Chinese army on the evening of the 10th. On the evening of the 12th, a Japanese army vehicle inspecting the road ran over a landmine planted by the Chinese forces nearby, and the vehicle was destroyed. (Dispatch of the 15th)</p>
<h3>Wei Lihuang Discusses the Situation in Southern Shanxi</h3>
<p>Chongqing: General Wei Lihuang, Commander of the Shanxi-Henan War Zone, recently told the press that the Japanese troops in southern Shanxi have already undertaken their tenth "suppression" campaign against the thousands of Chinese guerrillas in Zhongtiao Mountain, but the result is still unsuccessful, and they have retreated to their defensive cities. General Wei stated that Zhongtiao Mountain is a fortress for defending against the Japanese troops in southern Shanxi. The mountain is sufficient to protect the thousands of Chinese guerrillas who harass the Japanese troops and prevent the weary Japanese troops from penetrating deeply. The Japanese 11th "suppression" campaign resulted in the loss of 200,000 men. Currently, the Japanese have only their 12th Division, which has been reinforced 27 times. General Wei also stated that he believes that the Japanese military strength in North China does not allow them to attack Free China to the west. The Japanese claim that they want to attack southern Shaanxi along the Han River and move towards Gansu to cut off international routes is nothing more than a fantasy. To carry out this plan, the Japanese would have to deploy countless divisions, but at present, every Japanese soldier in North China has to fight against the guerrillas, and he does not know how they can mobilize a large army to advance west. (United Press dispatch of the 15th)</p>
<h3>Third Interest Payment Period for National Salvation Bonds</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to the Ministry of Finance, the third interest payment for the National Salvation Bonds will be issued by the four banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China) starting on August 11th.

<h3>Control Yuan Seeks to Improve Commissioned Investigations</h3>
<h3>Plans to Draft Measures for Commissioned Investigations</h3>
<h3>To Give People More Opportunities to Seek Redress</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Control Yuan's investigation of cases is divided into two categories: dispatched investigations and commissioned investigations. In the past six months, a total of more than 500 written complaints have been received. Among them, matters that are not within the scope of the Yuan's responsibilities and those that are factually incorrect will not be accepted and will be filed after review and approval. For all other cases, the Yuan cannot send personnel to investigate all of them, and a portion is commissioned to other agencies for investigation. Fearing that the commissioned agencies cannot provide accurate answers, which may result in the people's suffering or the inability to fully seek redress, the Yuan is now seeking to improve this work and plans to draft measures for commissioned investigations, so that the commissioned investigation agencies have a basis to rely on, in order to achieve the effect of supervision.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>America in a Dangerous Period</h3>
<p>U.S. Representative Carlsen yesterday asked Secretary of the Navy Knox during a hearing before the House Military Affairs Committee, "Is there a danger of the United States participating in the Far Eastern war?" Knox replied, "In this dangerous period, no one knows." Such a question and answer does not seem to offer any concrete new enlightenment: however, the firm grasp of its established national policy by American political authorities, the recognition of the seriousness of the Far Eastern situation, and the understanding that American participation in the Far Eastern war is possible at any time, are all revealed in this question and answer.</p>
<p>Does the United States have ways to implement its national policy other than engaging in war? Does the United States have the power to maintain its interests other than engaging in war? If it is said that war can be avoided, then where are the effective methods? If it is said that war is inevitable, then where is the opportune moment? Regarding all these questions, there are likely to be some differing views among Americans; at least, as of today, it is still difficult to obtain a unanimous answer. To attempt to encourage Americans today to unanimously advocate immediate entry into the war, or to attempt to coerce Americans to unanimously advocate abandoning their interests and withdrawing from the Far East, is bound to be futile. It is said that when the British Ambassador to the United States visited the U.S. State Department regarding the issue of withdrawing British troops stationed in China, he offered some suggestions regarding the responsibilities that the United States should assume in the Far East in the future; the authorities coldly replied that the United States has its own ideas and does not need others to meddle. What is said may not be exactly true, but since American national policy is extremely firm, and American general customs and habits, stemming from a sense of self-respect, deeply abhor propaganda, disdain lobbying, and are happy to hear various views without much judgment and to make their own judgments; then the coldness of the U.S. State Department, as reported, is truly a typical American spirit. Even the Secretary of the Navy's reply to the Congressman, avoiding definitive words, also captures the essence of American politics. Americans are still pained by President Wilson's participation in the First World War and the victory, up to the failure of the Fourteen Points; the reaction to this pain is the rise of isolationist theory; the lesson of this pain is the caution of general attitudes; and politicians with true insight have also learned from this and not only avoid mentioning the so-called parallel action or group action in the international arena, but also fear to do so. They diligently work day and night to relentlessly uphold what they believe, determine their choices, improve their strength, strive for complete security, and then choose the most reasonable path, the most appropriate moment, and proceed step by step, acting independently to achieve their goals. The repeated measures taken by the United States to deal with the Far Eastern situation in the past three years have all been like this, as can be reviewed.</p>
<p>As for the future, the United States has its most ideal standard, that is, by 1946, six years from now, the large naval expansion plan can be completed, and it can simultaneously cope with changes in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans without worry. However, this does not mean that the current crisis is predetermined, nor does it mean that nothing can be done until six years have passed. At present: preparing a great army to compensate for the current inadequacy of the navy to simultaneously deal with two oceans is the reason for the mandatory conscription bill proposed by the U.S. government, this is one point. In the Atlantic, it sympathizes with Britain and hopes that Britain will not fail. However, the naval power of Germany and Italy is far inferior to that of the United States, so even if Britain unfortunately fails, Germany and Italy, after fierce battles, will not pose any immediate threat to the United States in reality; what is to be prepared for is only the air and the land; this is the second point. In the Pacific, the United States has already been threatened directly and indirectly. The Secretary of the Navy believes that we are already in a dangerous period; the stability of the Pacific depends on the navy, so the main force of the U.S. Navy remains stationed in the Pacific; this is the third point. How has it already been threatened? In the Hawaiian Islands, the United States is aware of the activities of the Fifth Column from the Far East in the islands; in the mandated islands around the Marshall Islands, the United States is aware that the islands have been equipped with military facilities in violation of the agreement; in the Philippine Islands, it is said that some political figures are trying to befriend strong neighbors as a way out of their political situation; all these facts are widely reported in the American newspapers and are well known to the general American public. Furthermore, because China has been invaded, the interests of the United States in China are almost non-existent; what can be relied on is either China's victory in the war of resistance, or the United States using its strength to maintain its own interests. Furthermore, with the threat to French Indochina and the coveting of the Dutch East Indies, this is a situation in which they are trapped as part of the "East Asian Economic Sphere." If this becomes a reality, then the American Philippines, located between Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies, will undoubtedly be at the mercy of others; and those who threaten and covet are currently openly advocating and striving to advance this reality, and the signs of this are clearly visible. Therefore, it can be said that a "dangerous period" has indeed arrived. If the United States does not quickly plan effective measures to implement its national policy and maintain its interests, then there will be no room to deny the so-called "danger of participating in the Far Eastern war"; what "no one knows" is only the timing.</p>
<h3>Knox, U.S. Secretary of the Navy, Declares: America is Watching the Crisis in Both Oceans; Navy Expansion Requires Six Years to Complete; Three Reserve Bases to be Built Immediately</h3>
<p>Washington - Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox told the House Military Affairs Committee yesterday that he believes that once Britain falls, a U.S.-German conflict may begin. He predicted that after Britain's defeat, Germany would immediately extend its economic reach to South America. If Germany were to gain military bases in Latin America, the seriousness of the situation would be difficult to resolve. Colonel Knox refused to directly answer a question about the possibility of the United States going to war with Japan, but said, "I believe we are living in a very dangerous time, and no one can predict where an attack will come from." He also said, "There is a dangerous possibility that our potential enemies in the Pacific might reach an understanding with our potential enemies in the Atlantic." Such an alliance could harm the United States. He declared, "If we had a navy of three million tons now, there is no doubt that we would be able to control the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, but our navy, which is expanding, cannot be completed until 1946." Colonel Knox pointed out that if Britain were ultimately defeated, Germany would control all shipbuilding industries, and its rate would be much faster than that of the United States. The Secretary of the Navy also reiterated the budget, saying that the United States needs 300,000 regular troops, and the proposal to supplement them with a national guard was submitted to Congress before France's defeat. He said that two years ago, after returning from South America, he deeply believed that the only way to defend the United States was to adopt the "Hemispheric Defense Law." When discussing the Panama Canal, he said, "Our country's most important foreign connection is in foreign territories." He also said that he had seen Germany sacrifice a huge amount of money to establish an airline on the Amazon River in Brazil. Finally, he said, "I asked why, and it was said that the airline could allow them to reach the Panama Canal from the upper reaches of the Amazon River in five hours." (United Press, 15th)</p>
<p>Washington - Washington officials feel that the outcome of the English Channel battle is also related to the fate of the Americas, so they are paying close attention to this war, and regard domestic issues as secondary. They hope that the British air force can continue to demonstrate its superiority. A political reporter for the Washington Post said that the fate of not only the British Empire but also all free people in the world is tied to this battle. The Baltimore Sun said that the war is now moving towards a new and terrifying extreme. Germany is deploying a major strike, and its success or failure is unknown, depending on whether it encounters strong resistance from resolute people. As Germany's blitzkrieg has begun, people are inevitably worried. Some quarters here believe that President Roosevelt will soon take action on the sale of destroyers to Britain. It is said that someone has already tested the opinions of members of Congress on this matter on behalf of the President. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Washington - U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox said last night that the U.S. Navy will build three reserve bases immediately, and there are 13 other bases that are being expanded. These bases will be used as training grounds for 1,600 reserve officers. (United Press International, 15th)</p>
<p>New York - Thomas, a Republican member of the New Jersey State Assembly, said today that Puerto Rico is likely to experience serious rebellion due to German and Spanish conspiracies. Thomas, a member of Congress, has just returned from a visit to the Caribbean to inspect U.S. defenses. He urged the U.S. and Puerto Rican authorities to take immediate action to stop it before it becomes unmanageable. (International News Service, 15th)</p>
<p>Enlistment Act Amendment Passed; Army Soldiers' Pay Improved</p>
<p>Washington - The Senate passed an amendment to the Enlistment Act yesterday, which will allow U.S. Army soldiers to receive monthly pay from US$21 to US$30, so that the Army and Navy can receive equal treatment. At the same time, the Enlistment Act caused a strong debate in the Senate. It is rumored that a certain Senate leader told President Roosevelt that although the bill had been strongly debated, it would eventually pass in the middle of next week. At the same time, Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox urged the implementation of the Enlistment Act in the Military Affairs Committee. He said, "The United States is now encountering the most serious crisis in its history. Once Britain is defeated (I hope this will not become a reality), we will have no friends on earth." Colonel Knox said that there is a reason why the United States needs the Enlistment Act. The first reason is to make American youth always have "the mentality that to preserve freedom, one must sacrifice." The second reason is that since the country "spends so much money" to purchase armaments, we should fully train the people and teach them how to use them. At the same time, President Roosevelt wrote to Federal Security Administrator McNutt, saying that he advises college students that their most important patriotic duty is not to enlist in the Army and Navy or find jobs in military industrial plants, but to continue their studies. The President said, "The decision to leave school would be unfortunate. We urgently need well-educated and intelligent citizens to deal with today's difficult situation." (United Press International, 15th)</p>
<p>Washington - U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox declared to the House Military Affairs Committee yesterday that Britain would collapse within 60 days. The information the United States has about the attack on Britain is not accurate. The U.S. conscription bill must be passed, because after Britain's defeat, the world will have no allies of the United States, although it is hoped that Britain will not reach this point. (Haitong News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>Washington - Nelson, the production advisor to the U.S. National Defense Committee, said yesterday that the U.S. Army can have 1.2 million fully equipped men by the end of 1942, and it is estimated that it will take another nine months to equip 2 million men. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Attitude of U.S. Republican Senators and Representatives on the National Guard Bill</p>
<p>Washington - U.S. Representative Miller, a Republican from Connecticut, proposed an amendment to the National Guard Mobilization Act yesterday, arguing that the deployment of the National Guard should be limited to the U.S. mainland, U.S. islands, Alaska, the Panama Canal Zone, and the Philippines, and said that the original plan would allow President Roosevelt to dispatch the National Guard to any place in the Americas. In the Senate, Senator Taft, a Republican from Ohio, launched a fierce attack on Secretary of War Stimson, Assistant Secretary of War Patterson, New York Times publisher Ochs, and other members of the military training camp association who supported the conscription bill, calling them warmongers and attempting to build a huge army that the United States does not need. He said that Stimson, Patterson, and others are engaged in extensive national propaganda, clearly intending to exert pressure on Congress. Taft said that the total number of troops desired by Sheppherd on the Senate Military Affairs Committee was only 700,000. A huge army would cost the United States a huge sum of US$350 billion. He also said, "We should not exaggerate the current dangerous situation. I believe that even if we want to cope with the threat of an all-powerful nation, we do not need to turn ourselves into an all-powerful nation." Taft said that it is absolutely impossible to protect Argentina, Brazil, and other South American countries with only one army. The Monroe Doctrine should be implemented by the Navy. If it cannot be implemented by the Navy, then this doctrine is completely impossible to implement. He also said that Roosevelt's administration would certainly hope to use our country's army to defend countries such as Brazil, Argentina, and Chile. He supported building a huge navy, saying, "I quite agree that our country should have a navy in the Atlantic sufficient to repel European aggression, and a navy in the Pacific sufficient to repel Japanese aggression. I believe that our country's current navy has sufficient power to move back and forth to defend against attacks from both oceans. If we can implement the Monroe Doctrine, we should have a navy as prepared as we are now." He concluded by saying that he was very skeptical as to whether Japan would attempt to invade the United States. (United Press International, 15th)</p>
<h3>British Parliamentarian Advocates Embargo Against Japan; House of Commons Debated the Issue of Blocking Burma</h3>
<p>London - During yesterday's meeting of the House of Commons, Liberal MP Mander questioned Under-Secretary of State Butler, saying that in view of Britain's closure of the Burma Road and refusal to transport oil and other materials needed for the war to China, would Japan be allowed to continue transporting them, and regarding this matter, should the government consider the U.S. ban on oil exports to Japan? Butler replied that he had no comment to make at this time. Mander asked again whether the government understood that continuing to transport military materials to Japan would be tantamount to sanctioning the aggressor and aiding the aggressor. Butler replied that the questioner might be satisfied to know that the government constantly kept all aspects of this issue in mind. Labor MP Noel-Baker then asked whether the government had considered adopting the American principle, which was important because the war might be prolonged and Britain should store as much of this material as possible for its own use. Butler replied that Britain's own needs were the most important. (Reuters, 15th)</p>

<h3>National Government Implements Price Controls</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The National Government is now taking effective measures to control prices and ensure the proper distribution of food and daily necessities, while also adjusting the national economic life in wartime. In addition to establishing a National Food Control Office, the Executive Yuan has recently decided to strictly prohibit hoarding of food and daily necessities. Violators will be sentenced to death for endangering national survival. The government has also decided to unify all anti-smuggling agencies. Previously, this anti-smuggling work was handled by various agencies attached to the customs of the Ministry of Finance and military authorities. In the future, all of these activities will be handled by a central agency, but details have not yet been released. At the same time, in order to curb extravagant lifestyles and prevent the outflow of funds due to the purchase and import of luxury goods, the public has been notified that various imported luxury goods stored in shops in Free China must be sold within three months (i.e., by the end of October). After the deadline, the government will take over these stocks and sell them at official prices. The list of luxury goods contains hundreds of items. The Chongqing Municipal Government has now established sales outlets to sell daily necessities and food at prices much lower than those on the market. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has allocated 15,000 tons of coal to the outlets for sale. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>Li Hanhun Discusses New Measures in Guangdong</h3>
<p>Chongqing - A reporter visited Li Hanhun, Chairman of Guangdong Province, on the 15th and asked about the new policies implemented in Guangdong recently. He said the following: In terms of military affairs, Guangdong Province has won two major victories in the past two years, which is due to the good fighting of the soldiers, but the cooperation of the people is also very important. Now is the busy farming season, and soldiers everywhere have actively participated in field work, which has greatly helped the harvest. This can be seen as a manifestation of the spirit of military-civilian cooperation. In terms of economy, at the beginning of my term, I was determined to accelerate the development of agriculture and industry in Guangdong Province, which can assist the military and stabilize the people's livelihood. Up to now, the following tasks are still being actively promoted: (1) Increasing agricultural production; (2) Improving handicrafts; (3) Promoting cooperative enterprises and strictly stabilizing prices; (4) Promoting rural loans. The above work has made good progress, so the lives of the military and civilians are very stable. In terms of politics, the most important measure at present is to implement the new county system and ban opium addiction ahead of schedule. The opium ban was completed at the end of June, which is gratifying to the people of the country. In short, since Guangdong was invaded, it initially felt threatened geographically and economically. After more than two years of hard struggle, everything has embarked on the road to recovery and prosperity. (15th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Easing of German Air Offensive; British Planes Raid German and Italian Territories Extensively; Two of Italy's Largest Aircraft Factories Reported Bombed; Search for German Paratroopers in England Yields Nothing</h3>
<p>London: German air raids on England have now greatly subsided, while the British Air Force, on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, launched the largest attack on enemy territory since the start of the war. In addition to heavily bombing German aircraft and munitions production centers, they soared over the Alps, a journey of approximately 1,600 miles, and heavily damaged two of Italy's most important aircraft factories: the Caproni factory in Milan and the aircraft factory in Turin. According to the Air Ministry's intelligence department, this was the first British air raid on Italy in a long time, evidently unexpected by the Italians. As a result, the anti-aircraft batteries were thrown into confusion, and their fire was sparse and scattered. The Air Ministry stated that the British planes hit their targets in the Italian aircraft factories, and the railway west of the Turin aircraft factory and the railway junction south of the city were also bombed. Hangars at the airfield next to the factory and the slipway of the seaplane station were also hit by high-explosive bombs, causing large fires to break out quickly. When British planes attacked German territory, the Junkers aircraft factory in Dessau, within sixty miles of Berlin, the main German aircraft production center, was bombed for over an hour, causing considerable damage. The Junkers auxiliary aircraft factory and airfield, as well as many munitions factories, in Bernburg, twenty miles away, were heavily bombed, catching fire and exploding, causing significant damage. A total of fourteen airfields in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France were attacked. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Milan: A supplementary report on the British air raid on Milan on Tuesday night, recently announced here, states that most of the bombs fell in workers' residential areas. Two bombs fell near the printing press of "Il Popolo d'Italia," creating a deep crater in the road. The glass windows of nearby houses were shattered, but the newspaper's editorial work was not interrupted, so the paper was published as usual. (Haitong, 15th)</p>
<p>Nine German Planes Shot Down Yesterday</p>
<p>London: According to current information, a total of nine German planes were shot down today. There was intense aerial activity this afternoon over the northeast coast of England, with large numbers of Spitfire and Hurricane planes appearing and disappearing in the clouds, engaging with enemy planes. Several high-explosive bombs fell in a workers' area of a certain city, and anti-aircraft batteries opened fire heavily. Enemy planes were also reported to have appeared over southeastern England. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>German Planes Attack Dover Barrage Balloons</p>
<p>Berlin: According to a statement from the Air Ministry and the Internal Security Department, the barrage balloons over Dover were attacked by German planes. A lightship was also attacked by six German planes, each dropping two bombs, killing two crew members and wounding several others. The survivors boarded other ships, and the lightship soon sank. Hurricane fighters took off to intercept, shooting down one German bomber into the sea, and the remaining planes fled back to France. In addition, German dive bombers attacked an airfield in Kent but failed, and two were shot down. German planes in several other locations were met with fierce attacks by British fighters, suffering considerable losses. Yesterday afternoon, several areas in southeastern and southwestern England were also subjected to sporadic attacks. High-explosive bombs hit Southampton, slightly damaging a train and injuring several people. A house in Hastings was destroyed by bombing, killing and injuring some people. In addition to the seventeen German planes shot down by British Air Force fighters in England, three were shot down by anti-aircraft fire, bringing the total to twenty. British planes are constantly in action but have lost only four, one of whose pilots has been rescued. Of the twelve German twin-engine bombers that swooped down to bomb southeastern England yesterday, at least three were shot down, and it is presumed that another one crashed into the sea before reaching its destination. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The primary target of the German Air Force's attacks today was the barrage balloons around Dover. The British defenses were very strong, and several air battles took place. However, German dive bombers broke through the defenses, and the attacked targets suffered no damage. (Haitong, 15th)</p>
<p>A Port on the Southeast Coast of England: When German raiders shot down an anti-aircraft balloon yesterday, a reporter narrowly escaped injury. The reporter was aiming his camera at the sky to film when the anti-aircraft balloon was suddenly hit and fell in front of him in a flash of light. At that moment, another photographer shouted, "Look out!" The wires of the balloon were already hissing past his ears. The reporter was standing on a cliff, watching the formation of German planes passing by. Every time a plane flew low, the coastal anti-aircraft batteries fired in rapid succession. When the German planes came out of the clouds and began to destroy the balloon, an anti-aircraft shell passed over his head, and the raiders had already safely flown out to sea. (United Press, 15th)</p>
<p>German Parachutes Discovered in England</p>
<p>London: The Internal Security Department states that there is no evidence of paratroopers landing in England or Scotland. After the department received reports of aircraft parachutes being discovered in two areas of England and one area of Scotland, the military police and Home Guard immediately mobilized and launched a large-scale search, which is still ongoing. However, no paratroopers have been found, nor is there any evidence that paratroopers have landed. After an enemy aircraft parachute was discovered in the Midlands yesterday morning, the military police and Home Guard not only carried out a major search but also took other precautions, deploying additional guards on roads throughout the area. According to a farmer in the area, a parachute was found near his field, but no one was seen, leading some to suspect that this was a German ruse. Parachutes were also found in a village ball field and in the flower bushes next to a house. Prior to this, aircraft activity in the area had been continuous for several hours. The night before, a huge plane appeared in the skies over Scotland, and yesterday, sixteen opened parachutes were found in various locations and handed over to the military authorities. However, there are no reports of any paratroopers being captured. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>London: Yesterday, a guard unit in a town in central England reported by telephone that a gray object had been spotted in the air. The church bells in the villages rang loudly, warning the people that German paratroopers had landed in central England. After the warning was issued, armored car units and truck police squads carrying "Bren" machine guns, along with villagers carrying rifles and old-fashioned weapons, searched for German paratroopers. As of yesterday morning, no paratroopers had been found. A company commander of the guard unit stated that a warning had been issued at midnight, saying, "A large object has been spotted in the sky. The search went on late, and a parachute was discovered. However, the British did not shoot at the parachute because they did not initially know that the object in the air was a parachute." Many believe that the parachutes are a new method used by the Germans to cause panic. (United Press, 15th)</p>
<p>Germany Announces Air War Results</p>
<p>Berlin: A German military expert yesterday made the following supplementary war report to a Haitong News Agency reporter: On August 13, the enemy lost a total of 132 aircraft, of which 89 were shot down in aerial combat, 43 were destroyed at airfields, or were shot down by anti-aircraft fire. We lost 28 aircraft on the same day. Not only was the south coast of England a target for German bombing on that day, but various ports on the east coast were also bombed. The ports of Hartlepool and Wallsend on the east coast suffered more severe damage, and the ports of Bournemouth and Plymouth on the south coast suffered more severe damage. In addition, the munitions factories of Exeter and Bristol, and the gasoline depots of North Killingholme were also targets for German bombing. The Eastchurch airfield southeast of Sheerness suffered the most severe damage. In the English Channel and the Thames Estuary, two patrol boats were sunk and two armed merchant ships, totaling approximately 15,000 tons, were destroyed. On August 13, German planes also attacked British barrage balloons on the southeast coast, shooting down twelve balloons in the Folkestone area. On the morning of the 13th, British Blenheim bombers bombed Aalborg in Denmark. Before they could drop their bombs, they were intercepted by German fighters and simultaneously hit by ground anti-aircraft fire. Only one escaped, and the rest were shot down. On the same morning, eleven British planes attacked Aalborg again, resulting in five being shot down. On the naval front, the German submarine commanded by Lieutenant Commander Salzmann sank a total of 41,611 tons of enemy ships, of which 11,400 tons were a British auxiliary cruiser. The German submarine fleet encountered several British destroyers in the North Sea. Despite being outnumbered, the enemy ships did not dare to engage and fled into the fog. (Haitong, 15th)</p>
<p>Berlin: This afternoon, the German war report stated that the primary target of German submarines was a British auxiliary cruiser (17,000 tons) sunk in the Atlantic. Although the weather was poor yesterday, German planes continued to attack British ports and industrial facilities, airfields, military camps, etc., with the Midlands and southern England being particularly targeted. The munitions factories between Brighton and Lewes were heavily bombed, and the munitions factories in Uckfield and Salisbury were also attacked. The main targets of the attacks in southeastern and southern England were airfields and the Aldershot military camp. Several air battles took place during the German attacks, with all victories going to Germany. In total, the enemy lost twenty-eight aircraft yesterday, and twelve German aircraft are missing. (Haitong News Agency, 15th)</p>

<h3>Hitler Disappointed in Attacking England</h3>
<p>London: Today, all London newspapers recalled that after the fall of Paris, German propagandists had set August 15 as the day Hitler would triumphantly enter London. The editorial in the Daily Telegraph stated, "Today is the day the Germans falsely claimed that Hitler would dictate peace terms in London. If this rumor is indeed true, then Germany's failure to fulfill it should forever dispel the notion that Hitler is punctual." The article also mentioned that the German planes had been attacking England since last Thursday, saying that Hitler considered this to be the first step in launching a decisive blow, naturally hoping to destroy our ports, factories, and airfields, deplete our air defenses, which are slightly weaker in numbers, and crush the courage of our civilians. "If Hitler harbors this goal, then the results of the first week of large-scale air raids must have greatly disappointed him. The German planes that participated in the battle outnumbered the British planes, but their losses far exceeded ours. This has made our dominance of the skies unquestionable. The German communiqué is habitually deceptive, and Hitler is even more brazen in his attempts to cover up the truth, which is clearly visible." The Daily Mail stated, "Regardless of what extravagant claims Hitler makes about invading England, Britain has already won the first round of the war. Our seas are now strewn with the wreckage of Nazi planes and the hopes of the Nazis." (Reuters, 15th)</p>

<p>Rome: Authoritative sources declared last night that the British Red Sea Fleet is preparing to take offensive naval action in an attempt to relieve the Italian pressure on Berbera, the capital of British Somaliland. According to reports received last night, British ships anchored in the Gulf of Aden suddenly sailed to an unknown location.

Regardless of the reports, the communications from Africa last night all stated that the British Red Sea Fleet had sailed to an unknown destination, and most reports stated that the British naval action was directly related to the Italian infantry's continued attack on British Somaliland.

<p>London: Reviewing the British Air Force's performance in the Middle East fighting against the Italians since June 19, it can be said that the British pilots and aircraft are superior to the enemy. Whenever British bombers and reconnaissance planes encounter Italian patrol squadrons, they can defeat them with superior tactics. According to strict statistics, since mid-June, approximately 200 Italian aircraft have been destroyed in the North African theater, while British aircraft losses have been only eighteen. In the past two months, the British Air Force has been constantly active, launching large-scale attacks on ten Italian military targets a total of 150 times. In addition, they have also continuously scouted various parts of enemy territory, dropping hundreds of tons of bombs. The South African Air Force and the Southern Rhodesian squadrons have provided the British Air Force with valuable assistance, and the cooperation of French pilots has also been effective.

<h3>Under Severe Italian Oppression, Greece Seeks Aid from Turkey; Italian Newspapers Vigorously Criticize the Greek Government; Greek Cruiser Helle Sinks After Being Hit by Torpedo</h3>
<p>Vienna: It is rumored that Italy has issued a new protest against Greece for assisting Britain, causing a tense situation in Athens today. It is said that Greek Prime Minister General Metaxas, after receiving the diplomatic note, immediately requested Turkey to provide military assistance to Greece in the event of an Italian invasion. What kind of response Turkey will give is currently unknown, but observers predict that the Turkish government will give very serious consideration to the current situation. According to reports, Greece and Turkey, together with Romania and Yugoslavia, signed a non-aggression pact on February 9, 1934, which is still in effect. (International Telegraph, 15th)</p>
<p>Istanbul: A Turkish nationalist newspaper stated that Italy is blaming Greece for the assassination of Albanian nationalist Haki Shehu, which is causing unease in Turkey. The Balkan countries are divided due to land disputes, and Italy is using the Albanian incident as a reason to increase its troops in Albania. Readers should not forget the events of Corfu Island in 1923. Today, this island has considerable military value to Italy, so it is doubtful whether there is a real rebellion in Albania, or whether this move by Italy is a manipulative tactic. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Rome: Rome Radio continues the official Italian intimidation campaign against Greece. The station's reporter declared that Greece continues to commit atrocities against the Albanian minority. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Athens: Greek King George met with Prime Minister Metaxas yesterday to hear a report on the increasingly tense relations between Greece and Italy after the assassination of Albanian Haki Shehu.

<p>Rome: According to the "Messaggero," diplomatic figures from Italy and Greece are actively working to eliminate the crisis in Italo-Greek relations. The Italian ambassador to Greece held important talks with Greek Prime Minister Metaxas yesterday. Metaxas also met with German Ambassador Schoenburg. At the same time, the Greek ambassador to Turkey visited Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoglu to inquire whether the Turkish government recognizes that the Greek-Turkish mutual assistance agreement remains in effect. The Greek ambassador to the Soviet Union has visited Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov, requesting that the Soviet Union advise Bulgaria not to take advantage of the current tension between Italy and Greece to demand Thessaloniki and Aegean seaports from Greece. (Haitong News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>Rome: Italian newspapers continued to write articles criticizing Greece yesterday. Some newspapers were particularly harsh. The newspapers severely criticized Greece's policies toward Albanians in the Greek region of Epirus, which aimed to deprive them of their nationality. Famous Italian journalist Gaeta published an article in "Italian News" stating that Albanians make up an absolute majority of the residents in the six districts along the Greek-Albanian border. The population of the six districts totals 168,203, of which Albanians account for 99,995, or 60% of the total population. However, the remaining 40% is not entirely Greek; there are also Bulgarians and other national minorities. Responsible officials here claim that the Albanian border incident, the assassination of Albanian Haki Shehu, has created a "delicate situation." "New Voice of Italy" continued, saying that the "criminal and hostile" behavior of the Greek newspapers is not welcome. The world welcomes the revival of Greece, but Greece should not suppress other ethnic groups to realize its revival. (Haitong Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Officials here declared yesterday that Germany's attitude toward the Italo-Greek incident involving the assassination of Albanian Haki Shehu should be based on the fact that Italy is Germany's ally. Regarding disputes between Italy and third countries, we should evaluate them in the context of the alliance. If there are two views, then the Italo-Greek incident is only indirectly related to Germany. Today, Italy's view is not only to make Greece, but also to make the whole world know that the Albanian issue is an integral part of Italy's entire policy. (Haitong Telegram, 15th)</p>

<h3>British War Minister Eden Reports on the War Situation; Britain Actively Expands Its Strength; The Real War Has Not Yet Begun</h3>
<p>London: War Minister Eden said on London radio last night that the day Britain takes the offensive and strikes directly into enemy territory will be the day the war truly begins for Britain. This is Britain's method of winning the war and what Britain must do. German propaganda has said that the war will be over in the summer of 1940, but we do not believe so. For us, the real war in which the British Empire can exert its full strength has not yet begun. Sea power is a more powerful weapon than land power, as has been proven before, and will continue to be so in the future. Germany knows this very well, but hopes to overcome this difficulty by dominating the skies in this war. However, superior sea power combined with a rapidly expanding air force is ultimately invincible. This is Britain's position today and the reason why final victory belongs to us and not the enemy. We have a superior navy, a superior air force, and a land army that is growing stronger every day, and we will surely achieve our goal of victory. When we attack in the future, Hitler's Fifth Column will no longer be found, and Hitler will have nowhere to find friends, because the people of all countries that have been ravaged by him will rise up. Speaking of the post-war world, Eden said that we are determined not to let the post-war world remain as it was before the war, and will never allow a third European war to occur in our time or in the time of our descendants. We will not adopt any plans for halfway concessions or bribing enemy countries to subdue them, but will adopt a perfect method to allow free nations to share peace based on the principles we believe to be just and faithful. Eden continued to talk about British defense, saying that 500,000 people have been drafted and trained since May this year, and in addition to the British army, there are also troops from the Dominions and allied countries, all prepared to make the first victorious counterattack when the enemy invades. Britain's preparations in terms of manpower and material resources are increasing every day. The number of domestic militias alone has reached more than 1.5 million. He is convinced that Britain can not only defend but also attack. (Reuters, 15th)</p>

<h3>Dutch East Indies Adopts New Methods to Defend Oil Fields</h3>
<p>Bandung: An Associated Press reporter recently learned from official sources here that the manpower and military equipment for the defense of the Dutch East Indies have been greatly increased in oil-producing areas. Previously, there were various defense plans in these areas to destroy oil wells, oil depots, and various equipment in the event of an invasion. Under the government's new plan, invaders must have a strong military force to carry out an attack. Army officials declared that the latest oil field destruction technology can destroy the largest oil depots, oil wells, and equipment in a matter of minutes. Officials also said that during the last World War, Germany could repair the destroyed Romanian oil fields and start extracting oil within a few days, but if the oil fields in the Dutch East Indies are destroyed now, it will take an extremely long time to recover. An army officer told the Associated Press reporter that if the "enemy" who relies on the supply of oil from the Dutch East Indies attacks the Dutch East Indies, the result will be that they will not be able to obtain oil supplies for a very long time. He also said that there is no fear of Fifth Column activities here, because the lessons learned by the Netherlands have been kept firmly in mind. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>

<p>Tokyo: The Japanese newspapers are paying close attention to the meeting between Prime Minister Konoe and the generals. The "Kokumin Shimbun" believes that, based on changes in the world situation and changes in Japanese foreign policy, the Japanese government will take certain decisive diplomatic steps. The vague attitude of Britain and the United States forces Japan to make a decision. The "Yomiuri Shimbun" said that Japan has suffered for three years and can no longer tolerate it. It will cancel foreign concessions in the areas of China that have been occupied. The "Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun" said that the talks between Japanese generals and the Prime Minister were specifically held to discuss issues between Japan, Britain, the United States, the Dutch East Indies, and Vietnam, and were based on the Greater East Asia policy.

Since the Meiji Restoration, Japan has implemented a multi-party political system and a system of freedom of association. The Minseito Party was the mainstay of this traditional spirit. Observers generally believe that with the Minseito Party announcing its dissolution, Japan's old history can be said to have come to an end, and a new page will be opened. (Telegraph, 15th)</p>

<p>People in the local Chinese and foreign communities are deeply concerned about the Foreign Defense Forces Commanders' meeting, which was held at the Municipal Council meeting room at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. However, the results of the meeting were not announced and will not be released until 9:00 a.m. today.

Generally, the defense of the central district of the International Settlement will be taken over by the United States Marine Corps, while the area north of the Suzhou Creek and the western district and the area around Great Western Road will be handed over to the Japanese army, but confirmation is still pending.</p>
<p>Central District Should Be Taken Over by American Troops</p>
<p>According to information from well-informed American community leaders last night, the United States is closely monitoring the progress of the British troop withdrawal. Regarding the issue of adjusting the British troop defense area, the American community believes that the central district of Shanghai is an area where British and American commerce converge, and all rights and interests are almost entirely concentrated in this area. Therefore, the British and American communities in Shanghai unanimously and firmly insist that the defense of the central district should be taken over by American troops without any doubt or concession. As for other areas, they can be handed over to Japanese troops in a friendly and reasonable manner.</p>
<p>Admiral Hart Provides a Full Report</p>

The spokesman said that the Navy hopes to reach a reasonable solution to the issue of the British troop defense area.</p>
<p>Garrison Authorities Attended Together</p>

Major General Simons, commander of the British forces, representatives of the French army and navy, Commander Modron of the Italian Navy stationed in Shanghai, and one naval officer also entered the venue early. However, Rear Admiral Takeda, commander of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces, arrived at 10:00 a.m. and stood on the car's running board for a long time to allow photographers to take his picture. In addition to the commanders of the defense forces and their aides-de-camp, Superintendent Smyser of the Municipal Council Police Department and Colonel Hempel, commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, also attended and listened. Admiral Hart dispatched his aide-de-camp, Lieutenant Miro, so he did not attend in person.</p>
<p>Meeting Contents Are Kept Secret</p>
<p>Although the commanders of the defense forces of various countries refused to make any comments on the results of the meeting, according to general rumors yesterday, the American defense forces here requested to completely take over the British defense area, but the Japanese representatives firmly opposed this. Colonel Baker then proposed a compromise solution, the contents of which could not be ascertained. However, the final outcome is still unknown. It is said that the details of the meeting will be announced in a formal press release this morning by Major Mann, secretary of the Defense Forces Joint Committee.</p>
<p>Baker Admits to Holding a Meeting</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported that Colonel Baker, Commander of the 4th Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps, invited the commanders of the defense forces (excluding the Japanese commander) to hold a meeting on Monday. Colonel Baker has now confirmed this, but he refused to disclose the contents of the resolution. It is said that he also invited the Japanese side to attend, but they declined. Representatives from the French, Italian, British, and American forces all attended, and Colonel Hempel, commander of the Volunteer Corps, and Superintendent Smaill, deputy chief of the Municipal Council Police Department, also attended and listened. It is understood that the resolution reached at the meeting was that the British defense area should be managed by the defense forces of various countries, that is, the Japanese army would take over the defense of the western Hongkou district, and the American and Italian armies would take over the other British defense areas. Well-informed sources claim that if this is correct, there will be fierce debates at this morning's meeting, as the Japanese demand to take over the entire British defense area will be strongly opposed.</p>
<p>Departure of British Troops Still Not Confirmed</p>
<p>The English-language China Press reported that the official departure date for the British troops stationed in Shanghai has not yet been determined.

<h3>More Than Seventy Ships Stalled in the Huangpu River; Moufu Searched While Sailing Near Gutou</h3>

According to a shipping company's statement to the reporter yesterday, with an average load capacity of 500 tons per ship, the total number of moored ships is 35,000 tons.

<p>Due to the decline in shipping, many dock workers, coolies, and shipping employees have lost their jobs. All the crew members of the German ship Lemsfels, which is moored within the blockade line in the Huangpu River in Nanshi, remain on board, while the Conte Verde still requires monthly expenses of about 100,000 yuan. The decline in the shipping industry has reached its peak today. Although the Guangzhou Pearl River was announced by the Japanese Navy to be open in June of this year, no foreign vessels have entered the Pearl River to this day due to the Japanese side's harsh regulations on shipping transport.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Non-Stop</p>
<p>According to reliable information from the shipping industry, the Swire Company's vessels sailing to South China have always stopped at both Guangzhou Bay and Guangzhou. This port also sells tickets for this route. However, the company suddenly stopped selling tickets for Guangzhou Bay yesterday. Inquiries made to the company's authorities did not explain the reason, only stating that they had received a telegram from the Guangzhou Bay branch.</p>
<p>Shenhua Aftermath</p>
<p>Regarding the aftermath of the hijacking of the British ship Shenhua, the relevant parties are handling the matter. According to the Ping Ming News reporter's information: (1) A batch of mail on the vessel was undamaged and has been delivered by the post office. (2) More than 20 overseas Chinese passengers have declared their overseas Chinese passports invalid due to their loss and are seeking replacements. (3) There is still no news of the nine kidnapped passengers and the declaration to Fujian to invalidate the hijacked drafts. It has been verified that the hijacked passengers were Jewish, as reported in previous newspapers.</p>
<h3>Important News Summary</h3>
<p>About 1,000 bags of mail from eastern Zhejiang are expected to arrive soon. The route is completely separated from sea transport.</p>
<p>The Refugee Relief Association reported: (1) The refugee food standard for the second half of July, totaling 16 days, is 4.25 yuan per person. (2) The second half of July provided food for 15,973 refugees from various charitable organizations. (3) A total of 5,575 refugees were sent away in May, June, and July of this year.</p>
<h3>After Lifting Special Alert, Defenses Remain Tight; Public Concession Still Under Alert Due to Defense Meeting Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the authorities of the two concessions began taking precautions on the 9th, dispatching Chinese and Western detectives and police forces, and blockading unnecessary traffic, the anniversary of the Songhu War of Resistance was quietly passed. The martial law measures were extended until 11:00 p.m. on the 14th and then lifted. The barbed wire fences placed at the blockade gaps on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession have been moved to the side of the road, and the armored vehicles in the center of the road have also been removed. There are no longer separate lanes for pedestrians to enter and exit, and there are no restrictions on inspections. The French Volunteer Corps and others have also been demobilized. In order to effectively maintain the security of the British Concession, the Police Department continued to take strict precautions yesterday, coinciding with the leaders of the defense forces of various countries holding a defense meeting. The barbed wire fences placed at the southern end of Simaolu Bridge and Sichuan Road on Yuqiaqing Road have not been removed. However, because the Shanghai Volunteer Corps and the defense forces of various countries were demobilized at 7:00 p.m. the night before, only Chinese and Western detectives are stationed at the gaps, and they still selectively inspect suspicious pedestrians entering and exiting. The blockade barbed wire fences at the southern ends of Chongqing Road and Chengdu Road, which connect to the French Concession, have also been moved to both sides. The situation in all places will return to normal today.</p>
<h3>Two Hostels, Great Eastern and East Asia, Both Had Kidnapping Cases Yesterday; A Traveler Was Kidnapped from the Great Eastern Hostel; The East Asia Kidnapping Case Was Intercepted by Detectives Investigating the Defendant</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, at approximately 3:30 PM, two Japanese individuals suddenly arrived at a room in the Great Eastern Hostel on Nanjing Road. They apprehended a Chinese man, put him in a car with license plate number 4995, and sped away. Upon receiving the alert, the Old Zhabei Police Department immediately dispatched both Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. However, both the people and the car had vanished. The investigation is currently underway.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, around 5:00 AM, two Japanese individuals, accompanied by four Chinese individuals, suddenly arrived at rooms 519 and 513 of the East Asia Hostel on Nanjing Road. They arrived in a car with license plate number 4991. The two Japanese individuals, armed with handguns, intended to abduct the travelers in the two rooms. Fortunately, the two travelers shouted for help. After someone reported to the Old Zhabei Police Department, Chinese and foreign detectives were dispatched to the scene. The two Japanese individuals and three of the Chinese individuals were arrested. One of the Chinese individuals managed to escape. They were immediately taken to the police station. After a preliminary interrogation by the police chief, it was learned that one of the two travelers was Wang Nanguo, 45 years old, from Taizhou, engaged in the pig bristle business. The other was Shen Linchong, 34 years old, also from Taizhou. According to the Japanese individuals, the two travelers were related to the guerrillas, but there was no evidence to support this claim. It was later discovered that the Japanese individuals worked at the Japanese Consulate. However, there were no orders to arrest anyone. Subsequently, the police department sent the two Japanese individuals to the Japanese Consulate. The remaining three Chinese individuals are being held for questioning by the court.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xiaolin: Coffin Sealing This Afternoon; Funeral Procession and Temporary Placement in Funeral Parlor; Many Notables Went to Pay Their Condolences Yesterday</h3>
<p>The case of the maritime figure Zhang Xiaolin and his disciple Wu Jianchen being shot and killed by Zhang's bodyguard Lin Huaibu at 214 Rue Wagner in the French Concession the day before yesterday, at approximately 1:45 PM, has been detailed in various newspapers. After Zhang's death, his body was laid out in his residence. Subsequently, the Shanghai Special Second Court dispatched a prosecutor to Zhang's residence for an inspection. Shortly thereafter, technicians from the Chinese Funeral Parlor were summoned to wash, make up, and inject preservatives into Zhang's body. It was then moved to the hall downstairs for placement. Meanwhile, monks and Taoists were invited for memorial services, and the family members were in deep mourning. It is estimated that over five to six hundred people went to pay their condolences throughout the day, including Huang Jinrong, Cai Hongsheng, Yang Shunquan, Ma Changsheng, Lu Xuepu, Fan Huichun, and famous actors like Zhou Xinfang. Dozens of telegrams of condolence were also received from afar. It is now scheduled for coffin sealing at 2:00 PM this afternoon (the 16th) at his residence. His attire will be a Ming Dynasty (landowner style) ceremonial robe. The coffin will be made of the finest zero-yin Phoebe zhennan wood, worth approximately eight thousand yuan. The funeral procession will be held immediately after the coffin sealing. It is said that the procession will be very simple, with only cars being used. At that time, the French Municipal Council will dispatch a full military band to participate. The coffin will be temporarily placed in the Chinese Funeral Parlor, and the burial will be scheduled for a later date. The route of today's funeral procession is recorded below: From the residence on Rue Wagner, head west to Songshan Road, pass Luzon Road, turn to the end of Avenue Foch, head south to Route Hogue at the Chinese Funeral Parlor.</p>
<p>Wu Jiancheng's Coffin Sealed Yesterday</p>
<p>As for Wu Jiancheng, who was killed at the same time as Zhang, his body was inspected by the prosecutor of the Special Second Court at the mortuary on Route Tenant yesterday at noon, after which his wives, Wu Zhangshi and Wu Wangshi, jointly signed for and claimed the body. After the inspection, the corpse bearers took the body to the Central Funeral Parlor for coffin sealing.</p>
<p>The Murderer Interrogated This Morning</p>
<p>As for the assassin Lin Huaibu, he is still held in the police station. Because yesterday was the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the police department was on holiday, so he was not sent to court. He must be interrogated today. It is heard that Zhang's chauffeur, A Si, who is also the murderer's old man and also serves as a guarantor, is now also detained in the police station, pending investigation to determine whether there is any connection with this case.</p>
<h3>Group Rice Purchase: Unremitting Efforts, Fixed at 20 Yuan Per Bag</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce relayed a letter from the Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee, stating that the committee was established on the 5th of this month and submitted its charter and list of members for registration on the 8th. The reason for the committee's organization was to follow the instructions of the concession authorities and attempt to stabilize rice prices and the rice market through evaluation methods. However, this method is only a temporary solution, not a fundamental cure. If we talk about a fundamental cure, then it lies in ensuring a steady supply and increasing reserves. Therefore, at the inaugural meeting, a proposal was made to promote group rice purchases. It was decided that, in addition to the rice industry associations finding ways to transport commercial ships and continue to collectively order 100,000 bags of foreign rice in the near future, a letter should also be sent to the Food Regulation Association to continue its efforts and achieve significant results. It is proposed that the Chamber of Commerce advise all industries to promote group rice purchases, requiring each industry's firms, companies, and factories to assess their needs, collectively purchase in bulk, and ensure adequate reserves for the people's food supply. Even in the event of changes in weather or human affairs, it will prevent public panic and the rush to buy, which stimulates market prices. This is what the committee earnestly prays for. Therefore, a special letter is submitted for approval and implementation, without any further anticipation. In order to prevent rice shortages and ensure the food supply, a corresponding letter is prepared and forwarded. The Chamber of Commerce is requested to earnestly promote it. It is said that the pharmaceutical industry has already notified its members to pay a deposit of 20 yuan per bag within five days of receiving the letter, in order to facilitate collective purchase.</p>
<h3>Banking Industry Limited to Reporting Interest Rates by the End of the Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Guild recently received an order from the Ministry of Finance to thoroughly investigate the deposit and loan interest rates of various banks. Before the end of August, the interest rates for the first half of this year must be reported in a table. The table is divided into (1) deposit interest rates, divided into fixed-term, current, and ordinary savings, and (2) loan interest rates, divided into credit mortgages, bill discounts, and interbank lending. It is learned that the Ministry of Finance has designated the Currency Department to send specialists to inspect the account books, inventory status, and other relevant documents of various banks to prevent direct commercial operations and hoarding of goods, as well as whether the use of deposits complies with the law, in order to implement supervision and management and bring the entire financial system into order.</p>
<h3>Post Office News: Shanghai-Guangdong Flights Resume</h3>
<p>According to Shanghai Post Office news, flights between Shanghai and Guangzhou have resumed. All airmail sent from Shanghai to Guangzhou can now be accepted as usual.</p>
<h3>Chinese Flour Mills Suffer Dual Difficulties; Each Shipment of Wheat Requires 2-3 Million Yuan; Exports Hopeless, Japanese Mills Resuming Competition</h3>
<p>The flour milling industry of local Chinese businesses in this city has recently been forced to halt production due to the interruption of raw materials. Bakeries, noodle shops, and steamed bun shops, which have relied on the industry's direct supply, did indeed experience a period of panic. After the manufacturers introduced the temporary use of inland flour and foreign flour, the turmoil began to subside. The new foreign flour previously ordered by companies in this city has been delivered by companies such as Weed &amp; Co. Flour from factories in the occupied areas arrives in Shanghai daily, with four to five thousand to ten thousand bags. The Japanese factories in this city are also accelerating production to meet local demand. Therefore, the problem of flour supply for the people's food in this city has been temporarily resolved.</p>
<p>Sales Channels Seized</p>
<p>However, the Chinese flour milling industry, which has endured difficulties and maintained operations for three years since the Shanghai Incident, has been declining. According to the industry itself, since the beginning of the Chinese mechanized flour industry, it has never suffered such overlapping difficulties as today. Currently, the northern and northeastern sales areas are entirely occupied by foreign flour. The southern seas are blocked, and Shanghai is also invaded by foreign flour, Japanese flour, and flour from the occupied areas. As for the raw materials, domestic wheat is subject to control and is also blocked. The flour mills have always relied on the surge of new wheat throughout the year for their entire business, but now that hope is completely lost.</p>
<p>Inconvenience of Ordering Wheat</p>
<p>Although there is still the option of ordering foreign wheat, the cost is extremely high due to the sharp depreciation of the exchange rate. Each shipment requires 2-3 million yuan in capital. Not only is there concern about economic inadequacy, but also many foreign companies are afraid of the risk and dare not accept orders. Therefore, only two batches were finalized last month, and the foreign companies are still unwilling to bear the responsibility for unexpected events along the way. Moreover, the shipping schedule cannot be accurate. The earliest shipment recently telegraphed that it would arrive in Shanghai after the end of August, but that is still hard to believe. Even one ship ordered and loaded by the Japanese themselves, which was originally scheduled to arrive now, must be delayed until next week for confirmation.</p>

It was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai at 11:00 PM last night for Hong Kong, Little Luzon, the South Seas, Bombay, and return to the United States via the Cape of Good Hope, as reported in yesterday's newspaper.

The last trip of the passenger tender will depart from the Customs wharf at 9:30 AM this morning.</p>
<h3>The Police Are Working Hard to Investigate a Gang of Child Traffickers; About One Hundred Children Are Still Hidden in Shanghai; More Than Two Hundred Have Been Trafficked to Xiamen</h3>
<p>Since the Public Concession Police Department discovered an international child abduction ring organized by kidnappers rampant in Shanghai, it has been ordered to strictly apprehend them. Several key members of the ring have been arrested in recent days, including two ringleaders. In addition, several kidnapped children have been rescued. Efforts are still being made to arrest the criminals in order to eliminate this social scourge that separates families. It is also learned that the authorities have found that about one hundred and fifty children kidnapped in Shanghai by the kidnappers' ring are still hidden in Shanghai and have not been sold, and about two hundred have been trafficked to Xiamen.</p>
<h3>All Customs Police Demand Increased Subsidies; Customs Agrees to Follow the Post Office's Example</h3>
<p>Over a thousand customs police and other unranked employees of the Jianghai Customs have recently requested the authorities to increase subsidies based on the cost-of-living index published monthly by the Public Works Department, and also requested an annual increase of 40% of their monthly salary. It is learned that the Customs Commissioner had previously agreed to handle the employee subsidies in the same way as the Shanghai Postal Administration. According to a reporter from the Tax Police New Voice Society yesterday, the Postal Administration employees' subsidies, in addition to rice subsidies and local subsidies, have now been approved by the Kunming Postal Administration of the Ministry of Communications, and an additional 75% of their monthly salary has been paid to each person since June of this year. The tax police continued, "Last month, one yuan of national currency was only worth 23 cents. Our salaried class has seen at least a 50% drop compared to pre-war salaries." It is also learned that the Jianghai Customs Police intend to separately petition the authorities to open training courses and conduct examinations to provide opportunities for promotion.</p>
<h3>Norwegian Consulate Administration Subject to Orders from the Current Government; Norwegian Consul to Return to Shanghai at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>Mr. Kraztun, the Norwegian Consul-General in Shanghai, left Shanghai with his family a month ago to escape the summer heat in Japan. A telegram has now been received stating that he is scheduled to return to Shanghai by ship at the end of this month. During Mr. Kraztun's absence, all consular duties were delegated to Mr. Kiedel. As for administrative matters, they are still handled in accordance with the orders of the current Norwegian government in exile. Several telegrams were previously received from England to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Lee Yu-ying's Sudden Death Case: Account Verification in Progress; Further Verification After Clearing the Accounts</h3>
<p>Lee Yu-ying, also known as Jie Ru, the head nurse of the Chinese and Western Sanatorium at 563 Route Pere Robert, died of a stroke, leaving behind 8,700 yuan in cash, three gold bracelets, over 300 pieces of clothing, and miscellaneous items. During the autopsy, the prosecutor indicated on the autopsy report that the items should be handed over to the deceased's parents, Lee Shih-chen and Lee Lin-shi, for collection. However, Lu Zhong-an and Lu Zhen-qing, the father and son directors of the Chinese and Western Sanatorium, claimed that Lee Yu-ying had embezzled over 10,000 yuan from the hospital's funds during her lifetime, and that the remaining items were insufficient to cover the debt by over 1,000 yuan. Therefore, they withheld the inheritance and refused to return it. As a result, Lee Shih-chen, the deceased's father, entrusted three lawyers, Wang Heng-yi, Zhuang Ding-dong, and Lee Chung-dao, to file a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the Second Special Court against Lu Zhong-an and Lu Zhen-qing, the directors of the Chinese and Western Sanatorium, to preserve the evidence. Judge Yu Chang-zi held a preliminary hearing, and the defendants appointed lawyer Ling Chang-hsien and others as their representatives. The hearing was adjourned to a later date and the account books were summoned for further questioning. The case was reopened for continued hearing the day before yesterday. Both parties were represented by their lawyers. The defendant's side presented over twenty volumes of large and small Western-style account books. According to Lu Zhen-qing's testimony, the hospital's money was managed by me. Starting in July last year, I fell ill, so I entrusted the deceased to manage it on my behalf. Until her death, she did not hand over the accounts clearly. The accountants are currently verifying the accounts and have submitted a report. After deducting the deceased's inheritance, she still owes over 1,000 yuan, etc. The plaintiff's side also appointed an accountant to be present to assist in the verification of the accounts, and submitted evidence. After examining the situation and reviewing the account books, the court ordered that the case be temporarily suspended and resumed after the accounts had been clarified. Starting yesterday morning, the accountants appointed by both parties went to the court to review the account books.</p>
<h3>Fashion Store Owner Kidnapped; Criminals Vehemently Deny Guilt; Victim Proves They Participated in the Kidnapping; Awaiting Summons of Witnesses to Clarify the Truth</h3>
<p>Yang Yu-rui, the owner of the Jin Tai Fashion Company at 301 Tongfu Road from Pudong, was kidnapped by seven armed bandits at 11:50 AM on July 16 of this year and taken to a shed on Avenue Bailleul in western Shanghai with the intention of demanding a ransom. Unexpectedly, Yang escaped on July 18 and was escorted home by the police. Several days later, Yang suddenly received a threatening letter from the Shanghai Special Agent Team in western Shanghai, stating that Yang should not have</p>
<p>Escaped Privately</p>
<p>and was given three days to contact Yu Yapei, the general manager of the China New Musical Instrument Manufacturing Factory at 1234 Jing'an Temple Road. Yang reported to the police, who ordered detectives to investigate. According to Yu, the handwriting on the letter was similar to that of Liu Yong-sheng, a worker who had left the factory from Shandong. Based on the clues, the police arrested Liu and sent Liu's handwriting to Mei Yu, a handwriting expert at the Public Works Department. It was verified that Liu's</p>
<p>Handwriting</p>
<p>was the same as the threatening letter, confirming that it was written by Liu. Liu was sent to the First Special Court. Song Renfu and Lu Wanping, partners of the Jin Tai Fashion Company, identified Liu in court as being present when the store owner was kidnapped. However, the defendant vehemently denied the charges. The court deemed the case to be serious and the victim was not present, so the hearing was adjourned. The case was continued yesterday morning by Judge Chuan Lin in the Second Criminal Court. The victim, Yang Yu-rui, was also present in court.</p>
<p>According to Yang's Testimony</p>
<p>On that day, while I was reading the newspaper in the store, several kidnappers suddenly entered, threatened with guns, and forbade me from looking up. They put me in a car. Two bandits sat on either side of me, watching me with weapons. One bandit sat in the front with the driver, and black glasses were used to cover my eyes. We drove directly to the bandits' lair, a shed. Two bandits were assigned to watch me during the day, and three at night. After two days, two bandits went out to buy cigarettes and</p>
<p>Handed Over a Handgun</p>
<p>to another bandit, who watched my movements with the gun in both hands. Not long after, the bandit dozed off, so I took the opportunity to escape from a small path in the back. The bandit woke up in surprise and chased me from the main road, but fortunately did not catch me. However, the defendant was one of the two bandits on either side of the car, etc. When questioned, the defendant Liu Yong-sheng still vehemently denied, saying that he was working at the Ming Jing Film and Martial Arts Association at 20 Guomin Lane, 585 Rue Foch, and was</p>
<p>Working</p>
<p>and did not go out on that day. This point can be confirmed by summoning Ge Tan, a clerk from the association, to testify. In order to seek the truth, Judge Chuan, not wanting to be lacking in detail, ordered the defendant to write a note in court and ordered that the case be adjourned again for seven days to summon Ge Tan to court for further verification. The defendant was sent back into custody.</p>
<h3>Woman Dies After Miscarriage; Coffin Carried Out the Back Door; Causes Neighborly Discontent; Reported to Police for Investigation</h3>
<p>Wu Jia-yu, a man from Jiangbei residing on the upper floor of 303 East Jiaxing Road, who is now twelve years old, married a woman from his hometown, Wang, as his wife in November last year. Since their marriage, the relationship between the couple has been average. Recently, Wu Wang became pregnant for four months, and suddenly had a miscarriage on the 12th of this month. Ms. Wang's condition deteriorated sharply after the miscarriage, and she died on the 13th. Wu Jia-yu and his mother, Wu Zhu-shi, immediately prepared a coffin for burial and held a funeral at noon the next day. However, the coffin was</p>
<p>Carried Out the Back Door</p>
<p>causing general neighbors to complain and discuss a lot. Some said that the cause of death of the deceased was unclear. When Wu Jia-yu heard about it, he said it started conflict and they physically fought, and he reported to the police, saying that hooligans were taking the opportunity to extort money, while Xiao Ling-shi from 297th also reported to the police, accusing Wu of assault. The Chinese Detective Home Jujia, and detective Dong Qingquan went to investigate. The coffin had been transported to Dong Jiazhai on Qimei Road in Zhabei, but because Wu Jia-yu and others</p>
<p>Did Not Seek Medical Treatment</p>
<p>when the deceased was critically ill, and did not notify the deceased's relatives after her death, and secretly transported the coffin out through the back door, the circumstances were suspicious. In order to clarify the cause of death, in addition to hanging the coffin back in the car to the autopsy, the Wu Jia-yu and Wu Zhu-shi were arrested and taken to the Jiaxing Road Police Station and sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the above situation, saying that the deceased's</p>
<p>Cause of Death Was Suspicious</p>
<p>asking permission for detention, and to wait for the procuratorate to verify the body before further investigation, etc. When questioned, Wu Jia-yu and others said that Wu Wang-shi had indeed died of a miscarriage. When she was seriously ill, they had sought the help of a fortune teller to treat her, and that after death, because the landlord did not allow the coffin to be transported out of the front door, they had to transport the coffin out of the back door, etc. After a brief questioning by the judge Chuanto the neighbors Xiao Yuan-shi and others, they were ordered to be held in custody pending autopsy verification.</p>
<h3>Prison Factory Management Sued for Dereliction of Duty; Defendant Flatly Denies</h3>
<p>Dong Henian, the manager of the toothbrush factory in the prison of the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District on Route Massenet in the French Concession, was suspected of corruption. Huang Xiqiang, the warden of the prison, learned of this and reported it to the warden on the 20th of last month to conduct an inspection. As a result, over thirty taels of pig bristles, worth four yuan per tael, and four hundred toothbrush boards were confiscated. Warden Zhao then convened a meeting to discuss and resolved to dismiss Dong. Dong heard the news and directly asked the warden to exempt him from dismissal. Because he did not achieve his purpose, he scolded the warden as an old bastard. Warden Zhao therefore detained Dong and sent him to the Procuratorate of the Second Special Court for investigation. After the investigation by Prosecutor Sun Wei, he was prosecuted for crimes such as dereliction of duty and obstructing official duties. The case was heard by Court President Liao of the Second Special Court in the First Criminal Court. The defendant Dong Hongnian hired lawyer Zhang Danping to defend him. First, the prosecutor stated the intention of the prosecution, and then several staff members and prisoners involved in the case separately testified about the discovery process of the case. Based on this, the court questioned the defendant Dong Henian. According to the confession, the confiscated pig bristles and other items were handed down by the previous manager. As for the point of insulting the warden, he flatly denied it. The court deemed it necessary to investigate and ordered the hearing to be adjourned to a later date.</p>
<h3>Big Merchants from Northern Jiangsu in Shanghai Establish Clinics and Pharmacies</h3>
<p>Recently, Yuan Delin, a prominent merchant from Northern Jiangsu in Shanghai, together with his friends Wang Qishan, Fang Peiji, Li Chunhe, Yang Shiji, Yin Shunji, etc., raised funds to organize a clinic and pharmacy to benefit the poor, without charging any fees. The clinic is located at the residence of physician Wu Bingqing at 101 Yongping Lane, Route Mayen, and Dr. Wu was invited to serve as the director of diagnosis and treatment. Patients flock to the door for treatment, one after another. Dr. Wu carefully examines the patients and succeeds in treating them all. Patients are not only grateful for the benevolence of Yuan, Wang and others, but also for Dr. Wu's ability to revive the dead. However, the cost of medicine is expensive, and the supply is insufficient. Without the help of great philanthropists, it may be difficult to sustain. Therefore, it is hoped that those who sympathize will provide enthusiastic support.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Arms and Ammunition Seized in a Small Lane on Rue Paul Beau; All Confiscated Rifles Are of Unknown Origin</h3>
<p>Although the "August 13th" alert has passed safely, the defense works of the two concessions were removed yesterday morning. However, the French Concession police authorities are still meticulously protecting the security within the concession. Police officers such as patrol teams continue to perform their duties in the hot sun without any slackening. It is heard that around 8:00 PM the night before last night, the French Police Department seized a large number of arms and ammunition inside the dividing wall of a small alley in 258 Wangzhi Road, Rue Paul Beau. It is heard that the firearms were all rifles. The police department is investigating the origin of these firearms. One theory is that the discovery of the firearms was made because a woman at No. 13 in the small alley had a chicken fly over the dividing wall, so she ordered a child to climb the wall to catch it, and that the firearms were discovered. The police department received the news and immediately went to seize them.</p>
<h3>Detectives Forming Gangs to Rob and Assault, Arrested and Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Xu Jiasheng from Tongzhou, who worked as Detective No. 306 at the French Concession Police Station, along with his fellow townsman Zhang Boping, and the fugitive Zhang Guifu who instigated the crime, used their service revolvers at 1:30 PM on the 7th of this month to attempt to rob the home of wealthy Tongzhou merchant Wu Mingjiang at No. 20, Lane 133, Gordon Road. The case was discovered, and the Chinese and foreign detectives from the Gordon Road Police Station arrested and escorted them to the Special Court for interrogation and detention.

<h3>Unexpected Results in All-Cup Basketball; Liangxi and Moore Both Suffer Losses; Qunyi and Tianxing Fight Bravely to Defeat Strong Teams; Situation in Group A2 Becomes More Chaotic</h3>
<p>There were upsets in both groups of the Hezhong Cup Charity Basketball Tournament yesterday. At this critical moment, such miracles occurred, further consolidating Bailemen's position in both groups. Moore, with four wins in five games in Group A2, was neck and neck with Bailemen. Unexpectedly, yesterday's loss to Tianxing formed a three-way tie with Shangxing and Nanyang. Whether they can win the championship depends on whether they can defeat Bailemen in the future. At the same time, Bailemen must also lose to Shangxing. However, Moore must also face Shangxing again. At the end of the first half, Tianxing took a five-point lead with a score of 24-19. Although Moore's Ling Peng rose in the second half, the overall score was still a bitter 47-50 loss due to the excessive losses in the first half. In Group A1, Liangxi and Qunyi, Liangxi currently occupies the second-place position. Unexpectedly, yesterday's defeat formed a parallel situation with Huqing for the second-place position. Liangxi's Zhang Liangxiong and Zhuo Guoxiong were monitored by Qunyi, relying only on Liang Yunming to hold the overall situation. Qunyi's Weng Ren'an and Zhang Jinxiang had shots that were sure to hit. In the first half, Liangxi trailed by only two points with a score of 25-27.

<h3>Finance: Early Morning Forex Relatively Loose; No One From Chinese Merchants Willing to Respond</h3>
<p>The Forex market situation yesterday: HSBC's listing showed no fluctuations. The informal market for British and American exchanges was average. The underlying trend showed that British gold was stable, while the U.S. exchange rate was slightly firmer, as the US-UK exchange rate had risen to near the London exchange rate, with a difference of only 0.25.

No Chinese merchants were willing to respond to the initial offers, and the price immediately firmed to a high of 3 shillings 7.1875 pence for British gold and 5.46875 yuan for U.S. dollars.

<h3>Hong Kong Gang Purchases at Low Prices; Gold Price Wants to Decline but Stops</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold disk market situation: always flat and tired. Although most traders were thinking of running up the price, in fact they were hesitant to advance, which made the general floating traders tend to sell, and the quiet exchange market was also a reason for not being able to rise easily. The morning started at 5,780 yuan. After opening, it fell by ten yuan. Then, thanks to the sudden purchase by gold dealers, money changers, and Hong Kong gangs, it rose to 5,805 yuan. Although it was suppressed by the sale of another money changer, gold and silver dealers continued to absorb it sharply, and it rose again to 5,825 yuan. It was heard that at this time the foreign exchange was slightly soft, and in the silence before the noon closing, securities firms sought to sell, resulting in a closing price of only 5,812 yuan. The initial market in the afternoon was still good. After money changers, silver shops, and others disgorged, it fell to 5,803 yuan. The evening closing was 5,807 yuan, slightly lower by one yuan compared to the previous day. After closing, the market trend was slightly softer, retreating to the edge of the 5,800 yuan level. The total transaction volume for the day was over 2,000 taels. Silver shop ornament gold was unchanged. Customs gold and others remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Only Slightly Down One Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, each tael (ten liang) initially saw a continuous rise in exchange rate, a slight loosening of the U.S. dollar, and a price cut by a certain bank, resulting in a small opening price of 28 yuan. A silver shop offered 20 taels to gold shops at 5,780 yuan. Then, a certain bank was still full of selling intentions, and it fell another ten yuan. A silver shop offered fifty taels to money changers, retreating to 5,770 yuan. Fortunately, Hong Kong gangs were secretly active in purchasing at low prices, and a certain gold shop also relied on rich merchants to buy in, so it soon rebounded by 35 yuan. A gold shop bought 30 taels from a silver shop, rising to 5,805 yuan. After that, another money changer suddenly came to vomit, and it once again fell to 5,790 yuan. However, because money changers, silver shops, gold shops and others jointly bought on behalf of customers, and there were many floating traders who were dragged in, it once rose to 5,825 yuan. At this time, the turnover was still strong, but before long, silver shops and securities firms suddenly sold at high prices, and many floating traders also took the opportunity to close out their profits. The price had returned to 5,800 yuan before closing, and this price was easily absorbed. After entering, silver shops changed from selling to buying, and floating traders also cleared out their positions, so the closing price was still at 5,812 yuan. The situation at the opening of the afternoon market was quite good. First, a gold shop bought ten taels from a silver shop, rising to 5,818 yuan. Then it rose another two yuan. A silver shop bought ten taels from a gold shop for 5,820 yuan. Subsequently, a certain bank poured in, reducing the price by more than ten yuan. A silver shop offered ten taels to gold shops, falling to 5,803 yuan. After entering, a certain money changer covered shorts and securities firms bought in, and it rose again by four yuan. A silver shop bought twenty taels from a gold shop for 5,807 yuan, setting the evening closing price (after the closing, the market was slightly soft, and money changers sold a lot, losing to 5,800 yuan, but there were few transactions). As a result, it was slightly down by one yuan compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 55 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of spot gold from cash shops was more than ten yuan higher than the spot gold, and the purchase price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current bid gold was more than fifty yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Ornament Gold Still Suspends at 600 Yuan</p>
<p>The exchange price of silver shop jewelry gold per tael did not change throughout the day. Datong Line still suspended the original price of 600 yuan. The price of New Trade Line was the same as the upper price, and the purchase price was reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Market Declines Daily</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: Spot gold was stable, and British and American gold pounds did not rise or fall much. The supply and demand of British gold notes were uniform, and the market price was stable. The fluctuation of U.S. dollar notes was minimal, with a minimum of 18.24 yuan and a maximum of 18.39 yuan, finally settling at 18.35 yuan. The result was similar to the previous day. There was a slight supply of Hong Kong notes, and the market price was slightly lower by one point. The demand for Japanese remaining notes was still strong, with an evening market of 1.365 yuan. The situation of Korean notes was getting worse and worse, with a downward trend. The evening market had retreated and was on par with the legal currency.</p>
<h3>Securities: Strong Demand for Domestic Debt, Dividend Payment by Kung Ho Cheung Wharf</h3>
<p>The securities gray market is showing increasing upward momentum. Observing the continuous acquisition of shares by various banks such as Zhongfu and Xinhua in recent days, there are discernible clues, indicating increased avenues for chip release. The supply of chips on the market has noticeably dried up, while demand remains strong. It is rumored that the Shanghai Defense Forces Conference has reached a peaceful resolution, with no issues concerning the security of the concessions. The future of the current situation exhibits signs of gradual clarification, leading to a sustained increase in demand for government bonds. Yesterday, Lianhe and Hengfu consistently bought shares, while Lianyi and Huaiwei were also active. Xinfu also showed strong demand, and Jiufeng gradually emerged to cover short positions. Lemao accumulated nearly 120,000 Class A shares. However, Tongkang and Hongkang were the only two firms that sold shares. Yongkang and Tianfeng sold Class A shares, with the short side covering positions while simultaneously selling, yet the market price remained extremely strong. As a result, the market continued to rise by between two dimes and six and a half dimes. Class A shares were priced at 60 yuan, and Class C and E shares pierced through 50 yuan, reaching new highs after the dividend payment. The total transaction volume amounted to over 900,000 yuan. A concise table is provided below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 20 shares of Sanyou Industrial Company were traded at a price of 20.05 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's stock market at the Public Chamber of Commerce was extremely quiet. The entire market seemed to be awaiting the outcome of the Defense Forces Conference. Prices remained virtually unchanged, and transaction volume was extremely low. However, the overall sentiment remained optimistic.</p>
<p>London, 14th (Wednesday) dispatch: Today, the listed market prices for Chinese foreign debt and shares of various British companies in the Far East remained flat, with no changes in market conditions.</p>
<p>Kung Ho Cheung Wharf, a British company managed by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., Ltd., has scheduled the payment of an interim dividend for the fiscal year 1940 on August 29th, at a rate of 17 yuan in national currency per share.</p>
<h3>Grain: Abundant Rice Reserves, Stable Rice Prices</h3>
<p>Following a softening of the foreign rice market the day before, yesterday saw a more pronounced decline. This was primarily due to a continuous influx of goods, leading to a thickening of reserves. Each warehouse now holds between 800,000 and 900,000 bags, raising concerns about market setbacks. Buyers, wary of past rapid and significant fluctuations, have adopted a cautious approach, focusing on actual sales and only meeting immediate needs, including domestic and local merchants. Speculators, typically driven by opportunistic intentions, buy high and sell when fatigued. However, they are now only observing and not acting. Consequently, the market has seen more selling than buying, wavering initially before declining sharply. Closing prices fell by about one yuan compared to the previous market. The market has a large volume of reserves, with no end in sight for supplies. Furthermore, subsidized rice sales are about to commence, and warehouses are eager to clear their inventories due to the hot weather. Actual sales remain hindered, and stagnation has befallen both speculators and merchants. The total transaction volume for spot rice was only 2,600 to 2,700 bags. No. 1 old Saigon rice opened at only 57.3 yuan, new rice at 55.6 yuan, No. 2 rice at 53 yuan to 52.35 yuan, and small Jiaoxi rice at 52.3 yuan. No. 2 Siamese rice was only at 51.2 yuan, a decrease of one yuan to one and a half yuan compared to the previous market. Initial quotations for recovered original packages were half a yuan lower due to sluggishness among both buyers and speculators. However, some original sources covered their positions, stabilizing market sentiment. No. 2 Saigon rice was at 62.12 yuan, No. 2 Siamese rice at 62.2 yuan, and Jianyuan original source at 62.6 yuan, with a total transaction volume of four to five hundred tons.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice also saw brisk sales. However, there was a shortage of high-quality goods on the market, leading sellers to be unwilling to easily release their holdings. Under this support, prices only rose by half a yuan. Among them, Guanjin Litte opened at 61.5 yuan and 61 yuan, Changdan goods at 58.9 yuan, Hong Kong Litte at 59 yuan, middle quality at 57 yuan, and secondary goods at 52.3 yuan.</p>
<p>Over a thousand bags of thick and thin japonica rice continued to arrive. Amidst the decline in foreign rice prices, rumors circulated that the off-market dark market followed suit, falling by about 1.5 yuan. Changbang fresh Qing japonica rice was at 66.7 yuan, Wuxi Qing japonica rice at 65 yuan, Changzhou Sukun at 63.4 yuan, and Juezhi Su at 61.2 yuan. There was no market for thin rice. Nangang original package fresh early rice was at 62.3 yuan, and broken grains were seen at 60 yuan and 59 yuan, with Wujian at 47.6 yuan.</p>
<p>Zhoupu new japonica rice, due to a sudden shortage of arrivals, did not soften despite ordinary market appetite, maintaining a stable price of 62 yuan and 61.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Local Street Sales: Mostly Using Japanese Factory Flour</h3>
<p>The current flour market situation is generally stable. Following the forced shutdown of Fuxin Factory due to the interruption of raw material supply, Fufeng Factory has continued to supply flour. Most of the local street sales outlets are using Japanese flour and domestic flour. Therefore, there is no current shortage of flour. There are also rumors that flour loaded by Northern factories has been seized. Although not confirmed, it has caused unease among the people. The price of Chinese flour remains at 15 yuan, and the price of Japanese Phoenix brand flour has also stabilized, with this month opening at 14.6 yuan to 14.625 yuan and September at 14.65 yuan. The price of foreign flour has also remained unchanged. The total transaction volume for various flours is estimated to be around 6,000 bags.</p>
<p>Wheat market transactions remain sluggish. The supply from inland sources has not been overwhelming, and merchants with goods in storage are waiting for prices to rise. However, due to the difficulty of transporting goods into the concessions, they are at the mercy of the Japanese factories' scrutiny. Prices remain at around 20 yuan, with no way to increase them further. It is heard that the Japanese factories have good demand, but sellers are unwilling to release their goods easily. Therefore, the transaction volume is only over 3,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: New Buyers Hesitant, Yarn Prices Deteriorating Daily</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to decline, with a persistently weak trend. This is due to sluggish spot sales and a stagnant buyer appetite. Furthermore, the factory side is urging sales, leading to low morale. New buyers are hesitant. As for major traders, they are adopting a wait-and-see approach and are temporarily not active. The market is dominated by weak day traders engaging in scalping, with frequent buying and selling, but the market is shrinking.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened weak in the morning, lacking momentum. Scalpers and speculators are all adopting a short-term strategy, trying to sell after raising prices. 20-count Double Horse yarn opened at 926 yuan, but there were few buyers, and the situation was stagnant. It was heard that actual sales were slow, and selling pressure was high. The market gradually declined to 900 yuan. The half-day transaction volume totaled 1,830 bags. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 30 yuan. Today, 555 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each trade is listed below:</p>
<p>Same trade: 1,570 bags; Hong Kong: 250 bags;</p>
<p>Inland: 10 bags; Total: 1,830 bags.</p>
<h3>Dull Cotton Market</h3>
<p>The spot cotton market remains quiet, with no hope of progress from any side. This is because yarn prices are deteriorating daily, and the factory's attitude is cold. Therefore, raw cotton has little prospect of improvement. As for the overseas cotton market, due to Germany's intensified attacks, the situation is also inclined to fall rather than rise. Domestic cotton prices are generally on a declining path.</p>
<p>Three Yu Hua: 184 bales; Same trade purchased: 189 bales.</p>
<p>Huoji Cao Bao: 155 bales; Same trade purchased: 200 bales.</p>
<p>Mitelin: 258 bales; Gongda purchased: 100 pieces.</p>
<p>In addition, news from overseas cotton markets indicates that the New York cotton market is sluggish, with traders adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Due to the sluggishness of spot transactions, cotton prices have become weak, resulting in closing prices falling by 1-2 pounds compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by over half a rupee.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton trade has ultimately been dragged down by the decline in yarn prices, and the future appears as bleak as yarn prices. No transactions occurred throughout the day.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Factory Increase Warehouse Rent, Speculators Wavering, Eastern Cloth Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>The cloth market continues to weaken due to narrow sales channels, weak cotton yarn prices, factories urging the withdrawal of warehouse receipts, and sharply increased warehouse rental fees. Speculators' confidence has been shaken. Prices for spun cloth, twill, and fine cloth have continued to fall by 2.5 dimes per piece, while bleached and dyed cloth have fallen by 3-5 dimes. Local street transactions totaled over 300 pieces. Zhejiang merchants handled over 100 pieces of spun cloth, colored cloth, and colored twill. Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants handled over 100 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Overseas, Singapore and other places handled over 4,000 pieces of bleached cloth and colored twill. 485 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong on the 15th.</p>
<p>The decline in Eastern cloth continues. Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened in the morning at 31.8 yuan, with sellers eager to sell, leading to a straight decline. The market price fell to 30.9 yuan in the afternoon, before rebounding slightly to 31.2 yuan at the close. The momentum of Sijunzi serge is weakening, falling to 8.95 dimes at one point, before recovering to 9 dimes at the close. However, market sentiment is weak, and there is currently little prospect of improvement.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Edible Oil Rebounds</h3>
<p>Recently, the oil market has been affected by the decline in prices in production areas, which has impacted sentiment in Shanghai. The market has fallen for three consecutive days. Initially, this morning saw more selling than buying, with opening prices falling by more than one yuan compared to the previous day. Later, speculators became active, taking advantage of the low prices to buy in. Merchants seized the opportunity to raise prices, and the market sentiment improved, returning to the original level. 300 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were traded at prices ranging from 62.5 yuan to 63 yuan. 750 pieces of road goods were traded at prices ranging from 62.5 yuan to 64 yuan. 20 barrels of Qingdao raw oil were traded at 93.5 yuan. 20 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were traded at 97 yuan. 300 dan of Dayouyu Factory soybean oil were traded at prices ranging from 70 yuan to 75 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, 820 bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: No Prospects for Jinjiang Sugar to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The sugar market continued to show slight tightness yesterday. The Association's quoted price for spot No. 24 coarse white sugar remained relatively stable at 72.4 yuan. The price of goods in outside warehouses was initially flat before tightening, ultimately rising by two dimes to 72 yuan to 72.2 yuan. The price for delivery on the 22nd for re-exported goods remained at 56.7 yuan. Dutch cotton white sugar showed tightness, with TML at 3.3 yuan, up by 3 dimes, and KD at 12 yuan, up by 5 dimes. Dutch red sugar was at 59 yuan to 59.4 yuan. Taikoo Car White B was at 75.3 yuan, and DY was at 12.6 yuan, with no changes. H red sugar was at 58.3 yuan, up by 4 dimes. According to news from Jinjiang, the price of domestic sugar is too high, making it impossible to transport it to Shanghai. It is more convenient to transport it to Oujiang by sailboat, and the high price of sugar in the interior is also a factor.</p>
<h3>Coal: Anthracite Dust Rebounds</h3>
<p>Since the decline in anthracite dust prices last month, sales have been sluggish, with little improvement. However, recently, stimulated by the rising prices of lump coal, it has shown a slight rebound. Indian anthracite dust is priced at 175 yuan per ton, Kailuan No. 1 dust at 160 yuan, No. 2 dust at 140 yuan, and Keelung dust at 120 yuan. These are all wholesale prices among traders, with a small margin added for delivery to customers.</p>
<h3>Metals: Black Iron Billets Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>The black iron billet market has recently changed its appearance due to the further contraction of foreign exchange rates, which has boosted market sentiment. In addition, traders from Tianjin have been actively inquiring in the past few days, and local bottle factories, mirror factories, printing factories, and can factories have also been seeking supplies, creating a lively atmosphere in the market. Holders are confident, and prices have continued to increase compared to the past. The current market price is quoted at 1,100 yuan per bundle, which is several tens of yuan higher than the previous market price. If foreign merchants purchase large quantities of this commodity in the future, the market price may see further improvement.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: New Jinshan Branches Offered, Price Opens at 250 Yuan, Limited Arrival of New Jinshan Vegetables Leads to Rebound</h3>
<p>The price of new Jinshan branches is high, and merchants have not yet received any goods. Recently, trading firms have tentatively handled over ten boxes, which have arrived in Shanghai for trial sales. It was heard yesterday that they were sold for 250 yuan, which can be described as an unprecedented new record. When more batches arrive, there may be a possibility of a price decrease.</p>
<p>The price of new Xuzhou Jinshan vegetables had previously fallen by over ten yuan due to a slight increase in arrivals. However, production prices have rebounded, and there has been a shortage of goods from other sources. In addition, merchants from Guangdong and Shantou have been inquiring, leading to a recovery in prices. Yesterday, the market price was 85 yuan, with particularly high-quality ones at 90 yuan.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Scarce Arrival of Yantai Shrimp Tails</h3>
<p>The supply of Yantai shrimp tails has been extremely scarce recently, resulting in limited inventory. Goods from Longxudao were once quoted at 330 yuan, but no agreement was reached. A batch was finally sold yesterday, for 326 yuan. In addition, Annam Tianbian tails, which are cold-stored goods, were traded at 320 yuan. The overall trend is stable.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Meager Inventory of Northern Gorgon Fruit</h3>
<p>Northern Gorgon fruit, or medicinal Gorgon fruit, was previously purchased by Hong Kong merchants at a price of 39 yuan. Recently, due to a decrease in supply, inventory has become increasingly meager, leading to rising prices. Those with a small amount of goods are unwilling to sell them cheaply. The most recent quote is 42 yuan, and a transaction is likely to occur soon.</p>
<h3>The Revitalization of China's Silk Industry</h3>
<p>By: De</p>
<p>(A) Past Situation</p>
<p>China's silk exports have declined significantly in recent years. There are two main reasons for this decline: one is the defects in silk production technology, and the other is the declining quality of cocoons. The latter is the most significant reason for the decline of China's silk industry. Twenty to thirty years ago, Chinese silkworm farmers still had their own silkworm eggs, and each region was able to maintain uniformity. For example, Wuxi had the Wuxi breed, Zhuji had the Zhuji breed, and Jiaxing had the Green breed. Similarly, provinces such as Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shandong, Hubei, Hunan, and Shanxi also had their own breeds. The common characteristic of these regions was their ability to produce fine silk of eight to nine or nine to eleven strands, with uniformity and elasticity being the most outstanding features.</p>
<p>However, this situation changed ten to fifteen years ago, primarily due to the import of foreign silkworm eggs. These imported silkworm eggs were often inferior to China's native breeds. Moreover, small-scale rural silkworm farmers lacked scientific knowledge and blindly followed practices, which had a significant negative impact on the quality of cocoons. As a result, China's position in the world silk market has been shaken, with a trend towards extinction.</p>
<p>It would be an exaggeration to say that the loss of the export market is solely due to the poor quality of silk production. Because China has a vast territory, and silkworm farming is an important secondary occupation for the people, it naturally possesses a large number of silkworm breeds. China can rightfully be called the most abundant source of raw materials for silk production in the world, and its silk is among the finest in the world. Unfortunately, due to the lack of organizations for selecting and improving these superior breeds in the past, the situation has deteriorated. Therefore, the key to reviving China's silk industry today is to restore the quality of silkworm eggs. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Discussing Wharfage Fees</h3>
<p>In the past, opium and raw earth entering Shanghai were subject to wharfage fees collected by the Public Works Department in the British Concession, at a rate of four cents of silver per tael. However, the French Concession did not collect this fee. The Bureau relied solely on rent and donations for its expenses. As a result, an Indian man opened a new opium firm specifically within the French Concession in the hope of avoiding this fee. The new Sassoon firm subsequently moved to the French Concession, and now the old Sassoon firm has also moved there. Consequently, the British Concession Public Works Department is now receiving absolutely no revenue from opium wharfage fees. This revenue used to amount to 12,000 taels per year, but the sudden loss of this large sum has made it difficult to operate. It is not known how to compensate for this loss. The British Public Works Department has requested discussions with the French Public Works Department, seeking to uniformly collect this wharfage fee. If allowed, the earth firms would be moved back to the British Concession, and the British Bureau would be willing to share 5,000 taels per year with the French Bureau. However, the French Bureau has refused, stating that the procedures for collecting donations are in place and cannot be changed abruptly.</p>

<h3>Well Excavation Completed</h3>
<p>Seven charity wells have been excavated inside the new North Gate of this city. The project has taken several months and cost a considerable amount of money. It is now reported that all the wells have been completed. Each well is lined with two layers of tiles and covered with a flat stone, making them extremely sturdy. This will facilitate water access for residents and provide fire protection, which is truly a benevolent act.</p>

<p>Current Events</p>
<h3>Dawn</h3>
<p>By: Xiao Wu</p>
<p>The heat was unbearable. Not only was there not the slightest breeze coming in from the small north-facing window, but the heat rising from the asphalt road was trapping the stifling air inside. Grading papers under a five-watt bulb, sweat poured like pearls from my forehead, cheekbones, and neck, running down my chest. Wiping it with a towel was useless and only delayed my work. Because after grading these papers, I would need at least a few hours of sleep to recover from today's fatigue and continue teaching tomorrow. So I forgot about all the current suffering and focused my mind on the papers.</p>
<p>I don't know when it was, but looking at the pile of decreasing papers, I felt a sense of relief. But suddenly a moth flew in through the window, swooping towards the light. The five-watt bulb was barely enough to illuminate the characters on the page. The moth's circling and swooping caused its large shadow to move across the papers, making the words difficult to see. My eyeballs were also stimulated, causing some dizziness. This sudden entanglement forced me to stop writing. But what should I do with the remaining papers? Should I deceive those innocent children tomorrow, or sacrifice my own sleep? In desperation, I came up with a quick solution: I pulled the light down closer to my head. This way, the shadow it cast did not affect the characters on the papers. But it continued to circle and swoop, mistaking my face and chest for its target. The powdery fuzz from its wings stuck to my sweaty skin, making it unbearable. So I decided to kill it. I folded a newspaper into a paper bag and waited for it to fly into the net.</p>
<p>Sure enough, it was captured by the paper bag, but it was still struggling to fly inside. Because I was eager to grade the papers, I didn't pay attention to its struggles. After I finished grading all the papers, I stretched and sighed with relief. I suddenly realized that the sky outside the window was already showing a pale whiteness. A gust of morning breeze swept through, and this delightful feeling was hard to describe. At this moment, I remembered the moth. I took down the paper bag and saw that it had exhausted its energy and was lying stiffly inside.</p>
<p>The pale white sky gradually brightened, and the five-watt bulb lost its brilliance. I finally breathed a sigh of relief, turned off the light, and lay down on the bed. The cool morning breeze blew in from the window from time to time. Dawn had broken.</p>
<p>Amateur Musings</p>
<h3>Facing the Economic Recession</h3>
<p>By: Shi Wei</p>
<p>It had long been pointed out that Shanghai's prosperity was unreliable, meaning it was not a normal development. The reasons for this prosperity were, on the one hand, the past government's unlimited supply of foreign exchange to Shanghai, making it the main import station for China. On the other hand, the population of Shanghai gradually increased with the fall of various cities, especially with the flight of capital, concentrating hundreds of millions of yuan of speculative capital in this corner of Shanghai. This led to hoarding, speculation, and all sorts of unprecedented chaotic situations. But no matter what, it was not difficult for people to see through the bottom of this superficial prosperity. The rise in prices by four or five times certainly brought huge profits to various manufacturers; but it was built on the basis of unprecedented deterioration in the lives of millions of citizens.</p>
<p>Due to the expansion of the European war affecting foreign imports, due to the blockade of seaports affecting Shanghai's exports, due to the tightening control by certain parties, and due to the increase in living expenses forcing a large number of citizens to leave Shanghai, especially the general decline in purchasing power caused by wages not keeping pace with rising prices, the superficial prosperity of Shanghai had reached its end and was now heading towards recession.</p>
<p>Newspapers are already reporting alarming news: over a hundred yarn shops went bankrupt in June, 50% of cotton mills suspended operations in July, 30% reduced staff and salaries, and only 20% maintained their original state. Many chemical factories are operating for seven days and then stopping for seven days. Some enamel factories have stopped operating night shifts. The turnover of various companies is half of what it was before May 2nd. Two medium-sized sock factories and a smaller domestic goods company on Nanjing Road, the commercial hub of Shanghai, are holding closing sales.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is an extremely serious problem.</p>
<p>The bankruptcy of manufacturers and layoffs will further expand the ranks of the unemployed, further worsen the lives of citizens, and in turn make the economic recession even more severe. This will lead to social unrest, damage national strength, and allow evil forces to further exert pressure and temptation.</p>
<p>All citizens of Shanghai should pay attention to this problem, which is closely related to their lives. The concession authorities and leaders from all walks of life are urged to actively plan solutions, and newspapers and magazines should start extensive discussions. We have long felt that this economic recession would come, so we must not bow to it, but rather face it head-on to solve it. The focus of the problem is whether we can work together with one heart and unite to overcome this unprecedented difficulty for the sake of the future of our motherland.</p>
<h3>The Big Shot in Our Alley</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xi</p>
<p>"There's a big shot in our alley."</p>
<p>The "big shot" position has been passed down to several people already. The current one sitting on this throne is called Little Pockmark. He's about fourteen or fifteen years old, with a very sturdy body and great strength. Of course, this position was won through fighting, because after the "previous tenant stepped down," many people were vying for it!</p>
<p>Little Pockmark also has several henchmen. These are all children from families in the alley similar to his own. They obey Little Pockmark's every command, mainly because they fear his powerful fists. So, can Little Pockmark just beat up other people's children in the alley, and the parents don't care? Yes, someone is bound to ask this. But you see, Little Pockmark has a very capable older sister! Once, Little Pockmark was causing trouble in the alley again, beating up someone else's child. The child's mother went to Little Pockmark's mother to reason with her. Good! His older sister came out and said, "Little Pockmark was scared away by you. You come with me to find him, and I'll tell Mom to beat him. If he doesn't come back and something happens to him outside, hey! You'll be responsible for it." Then she rattled off a long string of curses. The other person couldn't out-scold her and had to give up.</p>
<p>Little Pockmark himself also has good methods! He doesn't personally hit people; he always instigates his henchmen to do it. And they secretly have an understanding. If someone gets hit and the matter is taken to their own parents, the others will come out and testify, saying, "So-and-so didn't hit him; he's just making it up." Their organization seems to be very tight.</p>
<p>Because we only have one room at home, after the sun rises above the roof in the evening, we have the children bathe and sit at the door to cool off. Therefore, our two children have also been bullied by Little Pockmark and his henchmen, and they had some toys and picture books taken away.</p>
<p>There was a boy surnamed Wang, eleven or twelve years old. Once, when he walked out of the alley, he was stopped by Little Pockmark and his henchmen, who demanded to borrow a dime for passage. When he didn't have it, he was punched several times and went home crying.</p>
<p>Shanghai is truly a strange place, where strange things happen everywhere. As for Little Pockmark, I don't know what his family does. All I know is that he certainly doesn't receive good family education. Perhaps his family even thinks his behavior is something to be proud of, as can be seen from his sister's protection of him. Furthermore, what he usually hears and sees and the idols he admires are probably so-called big shots, right?</p>
<p>It's not necessarily a bad thing for a child to have a desire for leadership, but they need good education to guide them onto the right path!</p>
<p>If Little Pockmark had good fathers, older brothers, and teachers to teach him, he would be a very promising child. (End)</p>
<p>The Hawthorn Detective Case</p>
<h3>The Ballerina's Fate</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Five: Bad News</p>
<p>There were four or five people standing in the telephone room, talking in low voices. Among them seemed to be a hotel employee. I looked towards the direction of the east corridor but didn't see Hawthorn's shadow. Yu Gantang had already gone out through the south gate. Of course, I had no choice but to follow.</p>
<p>I secretly pondered, "Could I restrain him and hand him over to the police? Would this action ruin things? Would Hawthorn agree?"</p>
<p>Annoyingly, I walked to the door and still didn't see Hawthorn. I looked at the parking area at the corner. His car was also gone. Strange, why did he leave me alone here?</p>
<p>I saw Yu Gantang jump into a rickshaw and wave his hand to the west. I felt a little relieved. If he had a car, I might have been forced to take emergency measures and restrain him first. At this time, my most reasonable action was, of course, to imitate him and jump into a rickshaw, telling the rickshaw puller to head west. I was separated from Yu Gantang by two other rickshaws, which was my best cover.</p>
<p>As the rickshaw proceeded towards Jing'an Road, I kept looking to the left and right of the street, hoping Hawthorn would suddenly appear. The result, of course, was zero. I smoked a cigarette while trying to figure out why Hawthorn had suddenly disappeared. Could it be that he also accidentally encountered Zhao Boxiong and was following him? Or did Ni Jinshou have some other important report, so Hawthorn didn't have time to wait for me and had already rushed to the police station? Or—my guesses kept hitting dead ends.</p>
<p>The rickshaw traveled for five or six minutes and gradually left the bustling city. When we reached Heyang Road, the two rickshaws that had been providing cover in the middle diverged separately. My rickshaw and Yu Gantang's rickshaw became directly connected. However, I still told the rickshaw puller to keep a certain distance. The rickshaw then turned south into Changming Road. Yu Gantang had turned back to look once in the rickshaw. I quickly threw away the cigarette butt and lowered my head, assuming he wouldn't see me clearly. However, the situation was very dangerous. After another three or four minutes, as Changming Road was about to end, Yu Gantang's rickshaw suddenly stopped. (77)</p>

<p>Entertainment Circle</p>
<h3>Cao Yu's "Thinking"</h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>Cao Yu became an instant sensation with his play "Thunderstorm," gaining international recognition. He then wrote "Sunrise" and "Wilderness," and his plays were staged everywhere. Recently, his one-act play "Thinking" was completed and has already been staged at the Lafayette Theatre.</p>
<p>This play is well-written and has good color. It takes a different approach, unlike his previous three plays. Wu Jian plays Old Gourd, practically acting as "Kneeling Pond." Anyone who has seen the director's role in "This Is Just Spring" knows his superb acting skills. Xia Xia plays Little Sweet Gourd, which is most suitable. Her voice alone is sweet enough. The few sad tunes of "Little Sweet Gourd, Sweet Gourd is small," are handled with great charm. Wei Zheng's Old Gail's Shandong dialect is incredibly lifelike, half of which should be attributed to the director Xu Sheng. Mei Cun's Teacher Ding vividly portrays a hypocrite who only cleans the outside of the cup and plate. Others, such as Han Fei playing the innocence of Little Baldy, Yingzi playing the coquettishness of Little Red, Vera playing the fast-talking of Lingdi, and Yan Jun playing Li Baochang's official style, all add color to the play. Although it's a comedy, it writes about the lack of appreciation for artists, which is actually a smile through tears. Therefore, I thought that at the end, after the audience dispersed in a chaotic manner, Little Sweet Gourd circling around to hit Old Gourd, and Old Gail and others following along to escape, was such a lively scene. I wonder if it obscured the agitation of sadness. However, if it were changed to a quiet scene, with Little Sweet Gourd simply grabbing Old Gourd's arm again and selling him off, I wonder if it would be incompatible with the previously lively scene, resulting in suppressing the ending, or rather, loosening the ending. I am an amateur when it comes to spoken drama, so I dare not make a judgment.</p>
<p>Performed at the same time as "Thinking" was "The Dumb Wife." Hong Mo's direction made this two-act comedy successful in a slapstick, film-like way. For example, the coordination of singing and movement, and the mechanical nodding and movements of the surgeons, were extremely interesting. Wu Nai, Xiao Feng, Xi Meng, and others' skilled acting won the audience's laughter from beginning to end.</p>
<p>It is said that soon Cao Yu's "Beijing Man" and "Metamorphosis" will also be staged at the Lafayette Theatre. We'll wait and see.</p>
<h3>After Reading "Some Views Offered to the Ping Opera Circle"</h3>
<p>(One)</p>
<p>— Jing Lu</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Zi Jia's long article "Some Views Offered to the Ping Opera Circle," I felt endless sympathy. Indeed, what he said was also what I had "wanted to say to the Ping Opera circle in my heart for many years." Now, what general Ping opera critics write is "either praising or scolding randomly," but they have never taken on the responsibilities they should bear.</p>
<p>For example, the need for reform in Peking Opera is universally recognized, but general Ping opera critics insist on sticking to the old ways and criticize the reform of Peking Opera severely. Not only do they not encourage the improvement of drama, but they also hinder it. As for nitpicking on small matters, it is their usual trick. The dispute between Kao Lan and Wang Lan, and the battle between Suo Mansion and Su Mansion, are very clear examples. Who is right and who is wrong will naturally not escape justice, and it is useless to argue unreasonably. But is this where the responsibility of Ping opera critics lies?</p>
<p>Therefore, Mr. Zi Jia's opinion is very correct. Ping opera critics should not nitpick on small matters or peddle dead men's bones, but should strictly point out the big aspects, such as the consciousness of the plot (note: Peking Opera has never paid attention to consciousness, but I think it is an important point) and its rationality, the structure and rhetoric of the script, the clothing that fits the era, and the cultivation and research of acting skills. These are all things that Ping opera critics should discuss one by one. Only then can they be worthy of the three characters "Ping Opera Critic" and the dignity of the title. I would like to follow in Mr. Zi Jia's footsteps and loudly appeal to the Ping Opera circle, asking everyone to change their style!</p>
<p>(Two)</p>
<p>— Fei Sheng</p>
<p>This publication disclosed the article "Some Views Offered to the Ping Opera Circle" on the seventh of this month. Reading it moved me very much, because I am a member who loves drama. At ordinary times, I want to promote it from the sidelines to make improvements, but my wish is only a wish after all. It is not easy to realize. First, the actors stick to conventions. To give an example, I once published improvement suggestions for "Capturing and Releasing Cao" in this publication last year, and I also spoke to a certain actor, but in the end, no one paid any attention. It can be seen that the conservativeness and stubbornness of the actors is one of the biggest reasons.</p>
<p>Second, newspapers and periodicals, for various reasons, always adopt the attitude of "concealing evil and promoting good." If there is a very frank work that points out a major flaw of a certain actor or corrects an error in a certain Ping opera text, most refuse to publish it. Here, I would like to offer a suggestion to the editor. It is best that the author be responsible for the article, and all troubles can be avoided. I wonder what the editor thinks? (Note) This point is difficult to follow.</p>
<p>Third, criticism must be based on good intentions. For all Ping opera critics who write, the most basic condition is to adopt a completely objective attitude and use artistic arguments. Taking the word "Ping" (critic) as an example, the left side is the word for speech, and the right side is the word for fairness. One must have fair and upright speech to be called a critic. Therefore, neither malicious slander nor blind praise that condones personal feelings is acceptable.</p>
<p>As for the progressive actors who have already automatically improved the plot, costumes, and lyrics, it is not uncommon, and of course, there is also a need to encourage them.</p>
<h3>Spring River's Moonlight Romance: A Glimpse into the Secret History of Polygamy</h3>
<p>The long-rumored 20th Century Fox film "Spring River's Moonlight Romance" has been showing at the Grand Theatre since the 15th. The film stars the three major stars Tang Ya Manqi, Andre Lee, and Ya Qiaosheng. The entire film is filmed in color, dazzling and eye-catching, and the story is touching, like a clear and beautiful poem. As for Tang Ya Manqi's acting skills, they have reached perfection, and it is generally believed that it surpasses "The Great Waltz." (The picture below is a scene from the film.)</p>
<p>RKO's romantic comedy "The Secret History of Polygamy" stars Eileen Dunne, Curry Grant, Gan'er Pan, and Patrick Lundoff Scott. It is humorous, hot, and full of hilarious events, and is a wake-up call for polygamy and a warning for womanizers. This film has been showing at the Nanjing Theatre since the 15th. It can be added that the Great Shanghai Theatre will be re-screening "Mirror for Husbands" from the 15th. With the two films being shown at the same time, Asian Film Company may have a plan. (The picture on the right is a scene from The Secret History of Polygamy.)</p>
<h3>Shi Junqing Joins the Great World Qiankun Theatre</h3>
<p>— Lan</p>
<p>The famous actress Shi Junqing (formerly Xiao Hanshen) has studied singing and acting in male roles. She has thoroughly studied the Tan and Qi schools. Her appearance is dignified and her singing voice is clear and bright. Her acting is deeply rooted in the word "doing." The expressions on her body and face are excellent, and she is rich in the so-called "acting" art. She has been with the Little Guanghan Theatre for many years, and those who have seen her plays all admire her, believing that she will eventually rise above the common. The owner of the Great World loves her talent and hires her with a generous salary. She will be on stage at the Qiankun Grand Theatre tonight, performing the full-length "Empty City Stratagem." Tomorrow night, "Xiaoyao Ford," and the night after, "Chasing Han Xin," all of which are her signature masterpieces. The right side publishes a recent photo of her in the play "Empty City Stratagem."</p>
<h3>Classification of Hollywood Actresses</h3>
<p>— Tao</p>
<p>Not long ago, many film magazine reporters in the United States gathered together to hold an election. They divided many Hollywood actresses into eight types according to their styles, and each type elected a representative. The results of their election are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Aristocratic type—represented by Norma Shearer</p>
<p>(2) Beauty type—represented by Danian Dalian</p>
<p>(3) Mysterious type—represented by Ann Sothern</p>
<p>(4) Passionate type—represented by Dolores del Río</p>
<p>(5) Lady type—represented by Myrna Loy</p>
<p>(6) Comedy type—represented by Claudette Colbert</p>
<p>(7) Tragedy type—represented by Bette Davis</p>
<p>(8) Lively type—represented by Priscilla Lane</p>
