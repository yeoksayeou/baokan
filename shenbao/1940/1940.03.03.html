<p>社評</p>
<h3>美國外交與歐洲和平</h3>
<p>歐亞兩大洲正在進行着摧毀文化屠殺人類的戰爭，各大國幾乎完全與戰事發生了直接的關係；能夠置身局外，站於大戰漩渦之外者，唯有義國與美國。然而義美兩國的政治外交軍事任何方面，亦無不受了戰事嚴重的影響；號稱中立，絕非孤立而得獨善其身！</p>
<p>在歐洲的兩組戰事，顯然有其不同的演展。英法興德國的戰爭確已歷時六月，但是除了海上潛艇活動，飛機與斥堠隊的遭遇戰，以及小規模的砲戰以外，迄今未有一次像樣的戰事。蘇芬戰事則較為激烈，紅軍恃其精利的軍械，猛烈進攻；芬蘭雖得天時地利，能作堅强的抵抗，但國力有限，若不能獲得外來的援助，恐難獨拒蘇聯的侵略，而保持國家的獨立。這兩組戰事到現在為止，各自為戰，似乎不相為謀；其實際的連帶關係，原來息息相通；尤其是到了最近德蘇簽訂了商務協定以後，兩國間實際上的合作，密切而微妙，已非表面形熊所能說明；因此歐戰的演變，隨時有其發生新劇變，創造新局面的可能。可是，現代的戰爭是立體的戰爭，以種種力量與條件的複雜，使空間廣大，使時間延長，決非痛痛快快的三仗五仗所能立刻決定誰勝誰負。因此之故，僅僅以歷史的智識與教訓，不夠推測這决歐戰的前途；莫說戰果，莫說武功，莫說利害影響，無從預為估量；即以持續的時間而論，亦無從逆覩其如何長久。所可斷言的，若使儘由軍事的演進，則決非短時間所能解決。交戰國為爭取長期戰爭中決勝的機會起見，彼此千方百計，以求資源雄厚至於無盡量。所以目前的各交戰國除了加緊充實其軍事行動外，一面努力於改善經濟機構，增進一般的實力，以期適應長期戰爭的需要；一面在外交上盡其縱橫裨闔的能事，拉攏與國，以冀自側面掩護其作戰制勝的進行，更自正面獲印他國資源的供给。美國是資本主義國家中的實際盟主，擁有偉大經濟力量，足以左右世界大勢；歐洲交戰國，若在資源方面得到美國為後盾，幾乎即已把握了制勝的絕對優勢；至少亦己獲得了較多的制勝機會。問題在於美國並非沒有魂靈的工具，他對交戰國的雙方有所好惡，而又非盲目的宗教信仰式的偏袒；他亦有其本身的利害關係，必須由異常複雜的條件來衡量一切；所以美國今後外交的動向，必予歐局的演變以重大影響，甚且予以最後決定的影響！</p>
<p>美國愛好和平的熱誠，維護民治的努力，除了瘋人在人以外，莫不深知，莫不承認；而其外交行動的穩健與堅實强毅，亦為不瘋不在者所共見共聞。我們理解了這兩點。若再根據了歷史的智識與教訓，、似得輕易斷定美國對於今决歐戰的態度與最後的趨歸。蓋在上次歐戰的初期，美國維持着中立地位；後來終究是實行加入了協約國方面，於是決定了德意志軍國主義的命運。這一次的情形，雖已不同於一九一四年友敵分野，亦自始不同於上次歐戰的初期；但種種基調，無論感情，信仰，或理智與利害，大體與往年仍無多大差別，吾們所最不能忽略的差別，却在歷史雖似循環，但非複演，往年的教訓是慘痛的，人類的理智是進步的：交戰中的英法德蘇如此，中立的美國尤然。因此差別，較之上次歐戰，現在却有逈乎不同的演出。例如最近，美國以其和平的信念，以其中立的身份，挾其雄偉的資源為國際發言的比重，於是而對於歐戰毅然採取積極的外交行動。行動方面凡二：其一，美國副國務卿威爾斯氏已於上月十七日前往歐洲行將先後聘問英法德義諸國當局，今已別了墨索里尼，往晤希特勒。其二，國務卿赫爾氏聲明與中立國家進行談話，共商「國際健全經濟制度的樹立」與一軍備的裁减」；現今方在沉着謹愼的進行之中。這兩項行動，方嚮不同，對象不同；內容分際亦不相同；但其精神與動機當然同其胚胎，計畫與步驟當然同其範疇而所希望的功效又當然同其歸宿。總統羅斯福氏與國務卿赫爾氏的運籌帷幄，發縱指使，自不必說，彼特使的威爾斯氏亦是美國具有政治頭腦，外交手腕的有數人才，素以熟稔國際局勢著稱，極為羅斯福總統所器重。此次奉命出國赴歐的使命，必能獲得有關世界大局的眞知灼見，作為美國調停歐戰的切實基礎。羅斯福氏告誡國民，對於威爾斯氏此行，切勿期望過奢：這是老成持重的政治家流露其熱情，決不能减輕吾們對於威氏使命的觀感。當然，吾們不應認威氏此行便得倒旋乾坤，但美國若不置身事外，則無論如何，必是奠定國際的主要因素！</p>
<h3>法國當局表示　無對日續訂商約意向　滇越路被炸引起法輿情憤激　界憂慮對法貿易前途</h3>
<p>東京　據日方消息、目下駐法日大使澤田、雖與法外部繼續談判、但法當局巳表示並無續訂法日商的之意向、此間日人認為法方此項態度、實由於下列兩項因素、（一）自歐戰爆發以來、法國已感覺有根本調整其海外貿易關係之必要、（二）法國之公衆情緒、因日本轟炸滇越鐵路而激怒、法政府已為此項公論所傾動、日商界人士謂法國在經濟關係、力與英國接近、並在集團之基礎上、調整英法之經濟制度、聞法國對於貿易關係、現努力與英國共同建立本國與各殖民地聞之廳給與自足、又謂英法現竭力限制貨物輸人英法經濟集團、對於輸人英屬剛果及法屬摩洛哥之貨物、實施一種執照制度、日本之绵織品、實際上已被禁輸往上述非洲各部矣、鐵政府更擬加强其對於輸出之限制、以便保留原料供其軍火工業之用、惟因日本輸至法國及其殖民地之主要貨物、為罐頭薩門魚及紡織品、均屬重要之日需品、故法方難以實施嚴峻之限制、同時法方似亦求必無故阻止各項原料輸至日本、以致引起日方之報復手段也、（二日路透電）</p>
<p>東京　日本政界方面今日對於法日商約今後之命運、頗為擔憂、深恐亦如美日間之陷入無的狀態也、按法日商的將於三月十五日滿期、滿期之後、法方或將拒絕續訂也、因法國自歐戰爆發之後、即覺有重行調整其對外貿易關係之必要、再則自日本屢决轟炸滇越錢之後、法國輿情亦頗憤慨、（二日合衆電）</p>
<p>巴黎　據負責方面之暗示、如日本再圖阻止貨物用滇越鐵路運入中國、則協約國將於日本利用西比利亞鐵路運貨入德事提出抗議、聞日本山西比利亞鐵務運往德國之貨物、內有高等鋼·棉布·與食物（二日路透電）</p>
<h3>日本擬派遣　廣田來華　任駐「偽政權」特使</h3>
<p>東京　據「報知新聞」消息、前任日首相廣出弘毅、將為汪政權」在南京成立之日本大使最有可能之候補者、日本政府擬派遣軍人為汪政權」之第一任大使、但因「阻礙」已將該項計劃放棄近衛文膺·平沼麒一郎·及松岡洋右亦為「駐華大使」候補者、由彼等「不能接就此任、」「派赴中國之特使、並不僅携政府致「汪政權」之慶賀而已、渠將授有調整「新政權」與日本間主要關係之廣泛權力、派遣駐「新政權一特使、乃日本事實上承認「新政權、」蓋與「滿洲國」成立時、派遺武藤信義大將為特使、同一意義、（二日合衆電）</p>
<h3>美進出口銀行撥巨款　貸與芬瑞挪三國　對華放款亦卽可實施</h3>
<p>華盛頓　美國建設銀公司董事長喬恩斯昨日宣稱、進出口銀行董事會已發美金二千萬元貸予芬蘭、一千五百萬元貸予瑞典、及一千萬元貸予挪威、俾在美國境內購買軍用品以外各種貨物、一般期望該行將撥款二千萬元貸予中國、喬恩斯昨日接獲羅斯羅總統出「杜斯卡盧沙」號巡艦所發無綫電、保證渠於今日返抵白宮時、簽奢參衆兩院通過之增加進出口銀行資本一萬萬元法案、（二日合衆社電）</p>
<h3>渝市積極　疏散人口</h3>
<p>重慶　當局因春節將臨、視綫明晰、為免日機空襲、致有不必要之生命財產損失起見、刻正在規模疏散重慶居民、重慶防務司令部規定、必須離市者、有政府公署若干、娛樂塲多所、及一切學校、衆信娛樂塲停閉而使本市减少生氣、則疏散程序、更易實行、政府機關疏散、共分三期、屬於第一期者、業已悉數移動、另有許多機關、不日將隨之遷出、當局並敦促商店運一部份貨物往鄰鎮、俾於轟炸時、减少損失、此間防空壕雖能容二十萬人、但防務司令部仍擬於可能範圍內、减少人口至八萬至十萬間、故料重慶將在短期內成為缺乏興趣之城市、而已接停業令之戲院電影院妓寮與西式菜館、均將减少、（二日重慶電）</p>

<h3>金融　投機商了結美滙　歐洲和平盛傳於市本埠美滙放長可能</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美匯暗市、半天悄况寗靜、惟投機商穩健者、對於美匯略有出籠、蓋因歐洲和半盛傳於市、倘果實現、海外美英匯兌有回出四元大關可能、換苜之、即本市美匯亦跟之放長更以本日匯豐續有供塞、且傳為代平準華金委員會維持之說、然當日外銀行多數見賤樂於吸納、故結果美匯現期、祇見長起〇三一二五、英金則呆站於叫辨士一二五原價、亳無變動、至晨開均半、仍為四辨士一二五及六元七一八七五、初以洋行雖扒、但匯豐則寨、致無影饗、旋乃少數華商本月期獲利脫售、故迨十時許、美匯略形放長、達六元七五、此後錢兌業及某華行雖亦跟跡吐出、但外行如華比某行等頗有吃胃、故頭寸尚告平衡、賴以站定、午刻狀態吏靜、迄至收盤、英金仍叫辨士一二五、美匯為六元七五、期貨潛勢、與現貨無別、</p>
<p>滙豐依然有供給</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近期縮三一二五、遠期跌一八七五、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美·滬·法·等各匯俱平、美對英長一二五、對滬未更、對法大二五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辨士一二五、美匯六元七一八七五、較之前收、均無榮辱、開後洋行界雖來扒進現貨先令、但匯豐仍肯供給、且斯時麥加利亦懷賣意、故毫無影響、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉小一分半、此後投機商忽四起吐出本月期美匯、但以為數均屬零星、故鬆勢極微、計賣予華比某行等價為六元六八七五、繼而某行複吐予洋行現貨美匯六元七五、同時華義亦售予同行現貨美匯六元七五、十時半後華商浮多、復稍來吐出、及華行華僑亦了結四月期美滙、但華比某行等外行吃胃尚佳、故得以無變、計投機商又吐予某行本月份美滙六元六八七五、及錢兌業塞予華比美金要六元八一二五、倘並華僑售予外行四月份美匯六元五三一二五、午刻為狀更靜、迄至收盤、英金四辨士一二五、美匯六元七五、本月期英金四辨士〇六八二五、美匯六元六二五、下月期英金四辨士、美匯六元半、結果比上日現期英平美各略長〇三一二五、午後週六無市、</p>

<h3>某種空氣復濃　金市跌風擴大</h3>
<p>昨日現金恰赤暗盤市况、回風擴大、幾破入叫千八百元大關、蓋因滙豐之接連塞出、又代平準基金委員會維持之說、且本日美滙轉硬、再以國內有某種利空消息、致市塲人心急告不安、更逢週梢關係、散戶出籠漸增、而大買戶港帮絕無扒跡、雖證券帮某號扒進有數、但終厭力量不足、無濟於事、上半日情况、晨初即呈軟弱、雖外滙報平、但一開即跌七元、為四千八百四十二元、尚屬當日高峯、嗣後再因滙市美滙帶硬，賣者更形擁擠、某金號與某銀號等紛來競塞、退達四千八百二十二元、後以某證券帮忽代本帮猛吸、同時金號亦有拖入、遂告一度轉穏、會回升達四千八百三十六元、惟其時塲中突有某種空氣、另一證券帮力代客帮傾吐、加之現金號及某銀號冉賣、市象又告難堪、迨至午收前竟出現四千八百元低盤、惟午收則為四千八百零二元、結果比上日猛跌四十七元、午後塲外稍告回硬、聞最後價為四千八百十元光景、半天交易的一千兩有餘、銀樓飾金掛小</p>
<p>烚赤瀉四十七元五元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）初開外滙雖平、但局勢略形疲軟、某金號首來賣出、加之進者極少、致開市即被撳低七元、售予證券帮二十兩、為四千八百陶十二元、少頃某銀號亦來力塞、同時銀樓帮亦賣、且滙市美滙報硬、降落二十元、銀樓帮賣予金號四十兩、為四千八百二十二元、嗣因證券帮突起買風、再加斯時某金號亦代客搜進、而某銀號亦稍有復入、遂回升十四元、現金號出證券帮三十兩、為四千八百三十六元、旋又某證券帮忽來傾吐、現金號賣意亦濃、某銀號及散戶等重來脫售、雖錢兌業與另一證劵帮逢低倘有吃胃、終難維持、迨至午收前、竟父降小三十六元、證券帮塞予錢兌業四十兩、遜至四千八百元、後銀樓帮進錢兌業五十兩、略回二元、為四千八百零二元、作午收價、結果比上日猛落四十七元、半天四十二元上落、現金號之本牌金賣出價、照恰赤較高數元、收進减低二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>首飾金掛小五元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸四百九十元、迨至十一時半、掛小五元、此後無變化、結果大同行改懸四百八十五元、新同行與上價相同、收進均减低十五元光景、</p>
<h3>澳票獨見猛升　八元九角</h3>
<p>昨日外幣英美余鎊、供結趨殷、市况軟弱、英美金票大戶吐塞楊爽、市價鬆動、晚市英金票降為五十五討二角、美金票降為十四元六角八分、香港票需要呆滯、新加坡票荷蘭票俱疲弱、斐律濱蔡跟隨下降、澳金票流通稀少、需嬰驟增、市價猛升、日金票微堅、晚市為一元三角零二釐、朝鮮票仍為一元零一分半昨日市價、英美金　俱降五角、英金票降角、美金票降六分、香港票降一分、新加坡票荷蘭票俱降一角、斐律濱票降五分、澳金票升八元七角、其他各幣未更、</p>
<h3>糧食　米儈作崇　竟無虛日</h3>
<p>昨日農間米市、不過平平、及店胃續進、客販喊聲驟起、浮囤散戶又來作祟、迄中市各色洋米價悉較前盤繼增半元左右、一號西貢開四十七元半、火紋售四十六元、小絞四十三元半、東京砶尖特四十三元三角、四十二三元、市四十二元五六角、四十二元、混合碎三十六元八角、米菉特別四十一元、如是者數决徘徊、後以實銷復均見高停手、市形似又轉軟、一般浮囤心思家不但不將手貨出脫、反藉此拉進、市面有帶緊之勢、至於糯米、咋則不以洋米之升昂而能並秀、誠以一般作客視乎市面無所希望、遂均着意於彼、去路殊稀、因之行情雖守原盤、未見上落、而形勢反有帶軟之色、厚粳薄稻及早晚稻等國米、以價格已貴、聞塲外暗盤殊衰、難有變化、祇南港早晚稻做開四十七兀、而其來源由虹口轉出者、早晚稻五百餘包、</p>
<p>另訊、洋米非晨開市雖呈軟象，然旋被業內外浮囤問津、而貨方亦以滙縮金漲定價不鬆、不肯隨市輕脫、市乃逐步抬高、結果各米均較漲三五角、午後形勢續呈挺象、回籠小絞自五十一元四角半大至五十一元六角、二號西貢自五十二元五角半至五十二元七角、二號暹遲五十二元叫五角、下午收市前貨方心思更堅會又喊高一二角、但無續妥、洋米現貨成交五千包、期六百噸、</p>
<h3>回籠粉漲半元　麥市擯持不開</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨市步見好轉、查二號粉廠盤在平賣期間、已無更動可言、紙有回籠貨棧單點綴市塲、因連日容帮略有問津、內地鄉莊去化亦告活動、一般持有棧單者、均圖扳守、聞老車牌售開十四元八角至九角、比前日陡漲半元、綠砲車喊價亦須十五一元五角、但無正式市面、</p>
<p>小麥　昨交易又趨檳局、蓋自連日麥價回落後、日廠方面、頗有擇巧取辦之意、而貨方終以目下存底寥薄、不願輕脫、兼之回籠粉價一高、人心更為望好、故貨方喊價立昂、而購者尚思壓抑、結果未有正式交易、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆市風改變</h3>
<p>邇來黃豆市况、自轉入疲途後、終難振作、蓋歲首各方興奮態度、大都由操縱壟斷所造成、故自上月下旬市風改變、人心下游、市價步步挫修、中决貨且有無人問津、咋行情雖仍續跌、但走銷略活、共計做開丁家州豆三百包、價為二十六元五角、蚌埠豆三車、價為二十五元、餘州豆一車、價為二十三元五角、南京豆二車、價為二十三元至二十元、及平湖杜豆五十包、價為二十五元云、</p>
<p>又生仁昨（二日）有二千五百二十包、及生油二千七百十四聽、均由靑島來滬、（三日）出口雜糧、有豆子七于三百五十包、及生油九百五十聽、運往香港、</p>
<h3>紗花　空戶乘勢活動　棉紗反動下跌　雙馬跌進九百元關</h3>
<p>連期大漲之紗市、今則轉趨下挫、但市塲上買進賣出之成交、異常興旺、所以市面之變遷迅速也、不過現紗生意漸見起色、華南港帮納胃較前為活健、故多方心思仍濃、惟歐洲有和平停戰消息、於是有一部份空頭活動、及浮多吐出而趨鬆懈、但價低落後、吸進做多者頗不乏人也、三月期最高價為九百三十元跌至九百零四元、收盤後又到九百十一元、</p>
<p>現紗晨開因外棉下跌、及不利消息並來、塲中買者缺乏、廿支豐馬一月期開價為五百二十五元、此盤一開、賣戶紛紛、檯面較鬆、少頃跌至九百十六元、中途雖經盤旋、然人心仍屬不振、空方某某大事加碼、　跌直到九百零四元、但盤一見、新買風復起、又見回升、惟現貨雙馬紗由九百十五元步跌至八百九十元、查半日間成交統計二千六百五十包、行情二十支雙馬跌十五元、今日有棉紗四百四十五件運香港、十五件運廣州灣、四十件運海口、一百二十件運海防、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>香港四二〇　同行二、二〇五</p>
<p>內地　二五　統計二、六五〇</p>
<h3>紗價稍疲　棉花漲勢稍挫</h3>
<p>本棉交易略淸、但印棉生意又見興旺、同行開始買賣允鉅、故人心尚佳、惟廠方華日兩方皆有需要、因之市面仍堅昂、不過紗價稍疲、徵受影響也、蘇北來源、計通州花三百零七包、茲將現棉成交情形列左、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價紐約棉市、昨日晨初開盤即因投機者之拋賣、後有外棉商上市賣出、及一部份多頭了結、市况回疲、結果收盤價格、較之上日跌十餘磅音、印度市上歐戰有和平空氣之傳說、因之市况頗軟、速同預測猛跌十羅比、埃及停市、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日因海外棉市之趨跌、因之人心轉疲、故交易不若數日前之熱鬧矣、廠方仍抱觀望態度、如有價廉者、則稍為購進、惟祇為零星交易耳、茲將昨日棉市以美騰六元八七五折合送廠價如下、</p>
<p>二十支美米特林　二六六·九〇</p>
<p>二十支　又　下級二五·六〇</p>

<p>三十二支　又　二八二·四〇</p>
<p>四十二支　又　下級二六七·四〇</p>
<h3>證券　外股跌多漲少　內債漲勢有力</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况漲勢繼鐵有力、買戶頗見踴躍、和平空氣、又死灰復燃、雖屬向壁虛構市上不少附會以遂其投機之始願、其上漲理由、大都不外銀根較緊、金子及棉紗之下跌、此種上騰、恐仍難以為繼、上午交易不多、買賣變方大都仍本其一貫宗旨、信孚樂茂聯益等買進、空方則鴻康久豐聯和加碼、市價微見上升、午後信孚愼康聯益同康大通等紛粉收進、丙種會高至四十八元六角半、旋以久豐聯和潤利以及鴻大協大等紛紛賣出、買氣頓受壓迫、勢乃稍歛、收盤後雖屬稍疲、但濟勢仍緊、下週當有一番競爭也、市價結果續好二三角、成交的有一百十餘萬元、茲更簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交通易信託公司股五百股、價為一元正、</p>
<p>衆業公所股票市塲、情况跌多於漲、公共汽車因罷工問題未獲解決、結果又猛落一元有奇、開平煤礦英聯船塢亦均告步跌、前者由六十四元降至六十二元、後者盤小達四十元零二角半、其他各股亦降一元至數角不等、惟會德豐德律風自來火等股仍頗堅定、橡皮股因市上有傅歐洲和平之說、故大都鬆動、然低價股如陳氏　則尚不乏買戶、結果反略上漲、</p>
<p>倫敦一日（週五）電、今日中國外債掛牌行　、仍告平穩、上下檔各債條、均無變動、</p>

<h3>疋頭　棉布漲風稍戢　客銷南洋最暢</h3>
<p>國布　昨布市漲勢稍戢、藍連日升漲甚速、而銀根仍緊、浮多頗有獲利脫手者、惟實銷尚佳、廠方因現市布價尚多不敷成本、開價高昂、故人心穏定、售盤大市不動、各貨散額脫售、價每疋小落二角半之譜、本街成交五百餘件、浙路溫州帮需胃最健、續辦粗細布漂染印花布三百餘件、間粤帮亦辦一百五十餘件、豫魯帮辦藍布府綢印花布近百件、津帮辦色素府綢士林布藍布一百餘箱、港帮南洋帮辦漂染布印花布斜紋五千數百疋、</p>
<p>東布　白貨細布細斜、晨跌午回、結果高檔龍頭細布每疋回落三四角、而中檔喇叭彩球等因染銷頗旺、略疲一二角、細斜比較平穩、北帮搜辦四月份期貨細布五六百件、故龍頭遠期價仍挺、做開每疋二十九元一角半至三角牛、</p>

<h3>平價煤球　購買者數萬人　購者盡屬貧民情殊可憫　彼輩生活艱難可見一斑</h3>
<p>煤球平售、於昨日下午二時開始、各煤球廠於上午、即將承銷數、交各平售處、康腦稅路赫德路口第十四平售處協源煤炭店，謂該地並無貧民、拒絕代理平售、故將其應承銷之　十祖、歸併於薩坡賽路一百廿六號第二十二處大森號承售、（連其應銷二十担共計四十袒）又第十七處松泰昌、昨誤為振泰昌、故實際平售僅一十五處、每日平售千担、</p>
<p>購者擁擠</p>
<p>此次煤球平售僅限每人二角、故購者均為貧民、人數較上次平協同時擁擠、增加千倍以上、各平售處未至一時、已人頭擠掛、兩租界當局、並在每平售處加派巡捕三四人、攔成直綫、依决候賣、究以購者搬擠、故至下午四時許、各處平售數量、均巳售罄、購得者共二萬五千人、收入現金共五千元、而未能購得者、仍達四五萬人、此决辦法、雖已改良、惟因必須臨時秤給、故手續仍甚麻煩、尚望有以改良、</p>
<p>澈底辦法</p>
<p>煤球平售時、平售委員會煤球業公會、及各煤球廠、特於二時半、推派代表陳萃芳·何子果·允春生·韓丕豪·等、分乘汽車、出發各處巡視、防止平售處之留難、各代表鑒於貧民眺買擁擠、足見生活稈度之艱難，磋議如市價跌至六元以內後、方中止此項平售工作、吾則決長期舉辦、藉以减輕貧民負祖、</p>

<p>事相問、發言人答稱、此事須加調查、另一記者問、公共汽車與電車兩公司得有工部局之特權、豈工部局不關心此事、日方公共汽車公司旣無市政特權、則日當局何能使兩者和解、日海軍發言人答稱、日方公共汽車公司乃在</p>
<p>特別情勢</p>
<p>下開始營業者、蘇州河北恢復公共汽車與電車、或將予不良份子以復趨活動之機會、日海軍反對恢復此等公共業務、因此舉將使日方不能維持有效的控制也、故此事務須重加考量、或問北區於樹立完全善警務管理後、日海軍擬否仍在該區</p>
<p>派駐哨位</p>
<p>發言人答稱、然、維持哨位、乃防務辦法、日大使館發言人繼稱、交還警權、乃賂恢復常態進行之一步聚、但無完全之正常狀態存在、今須對確實情況、加以考慮、日當局與工部局間數種、</p>
<p>分歧之點</p>
<p>己告和陸解決、實乃互可滿意之事、而雙方與「上海市府」均抱和解精神、渠確感此等和調政業與解決、將助長更佳之　氛、日當局預料日人華人與第三國人民間之關係、行將好轉、</p>
<p>豁免捐稅損失鉅大</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、據今（二日）晨披露、公共租界北區豁免一九三七年八月十五日至同年十二月三十一日之特稅、致使工部局損失一·一一八·〇一一元、內一·〇一七·六〇〇元係市政總捐、一〇〇·四〇〇元係房捐、此外、工部局復損失一九三七年之未繳捐稅二五五·三八七元、據工部局某員聲稱、北區居民於一九三七年戰事中</p>
<p>遭受損失</p>
<p>故工部局特准免捐　　九三三年滬戰時、局方曹取相類手續、但損失之捐稅頗不及此次數字之半云、記者今晨以上海電車與公共汽車兩公司有在北區恢復行駛之特權事、叩器工部局總辦兼總裁斐利浦、据客爯、渠對比事、尚未能發表言論、但不日將與日當局</p>
<p>磋商此事</p>
<p>與其他縣案云、又據電車公司某員聲稱、霍重公司絕無放棄其在北區的特權之意嚮云、日總領事三浦與工部局總董樊克令昨日（一日）簽訂協定後、警務處刻正忙碌從事必要之籌備、俾完全收回北區管理權、</p>
<p>北區居民迭遭拘捕</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、據蘇州河北區華人居民傳出消息、日方自二月十四日廢止通行證而華人紛赴北區後、遭日軍當局兜捕者、其數無從確悉、一說共數百人、多係成人、彼等之命運、猶未可知、或被押往日軍司令部盤問後、即已釋出、或則如訴諑所傳、已被、</p>

<h3>法公董局平衝預算　可望不加捐稅　嚴行撙節控制一切支出　本年預算當能收支適合</h3>
<p>大陸報云、法租界公董局行政董事柯蒂斯、昨日（一日）對客談稱、就目前微象察之、一九三九年度結束、法公董局財務處未有入不敷出情事、今預算尚未公布、渠不能引述確實數字、惟據渠觀之、公董局平衡預算、頗為圓滿、渠雖不能確料公董局將吾增加捐稅、但若無</p>
<p>特殊事件發生、或法幣價値劇跌、則法租界可望不致加捐、而公董局去年所以未入不敷出者、乃因嚴行撙節與控制一切支出所致、苟非經特殊委員會投票表決、則不能添撥款項予公董局任何部份、再、局方如發覺若干部份之經費有剩餘、並不立即耗此餘款、因局方知情况或將改變而需要此款也、故對支出</p>
<p>极度審愼、且局方恒照何者為最要、何者為决要之原則而支配經費、若須在維持警務或公園方面撙節、則所撙節者、當屬公園之維持經費、法公董局一九四〇年經常豫算收入一六·七九九·四八〇元八角六分、支出一六·七九五·五二四元二角三分、故預算收入、超過預算支出、但因物價續增與外滙不定、故上述者不能認為</p>
<p>最後数字公董局每年指撥警務處經費五百草萬、衛生處約三十萬元、局方於去夏購入大量煤斤、可供給至本年杪、故燃料費絕未大增、但明年供給各學校暖氣所費、或將激增、無論煤價如何、各學校終須有充量暖氣、至於為法租界居民採購大批煤斤、加以貯積而調整市塲煤價、則事屬不可能、蓋法租界</p>
<p>人口稠密非公董局所能供給煤斤之需要、且此舉將在市塲造成驚惶、而予公衆以煤斤奇缺之印象、徒使現况更趨惡化、柯氏末稱、希望公董局组織調查市况之特別委員會、將使物價低落、該委員會對於此種工作、當可較其他任何團體更為成功、因其目的在解決此問題、而竭力研究多數必需品價格高漲之原因也、</p>
<h3>民和輪由溫駛滬　又遭攔扣</h3>

<h3>宇宙綫之發明　脗合中國學理天文變象人間必有大亂　中國古代學說之科學化　米立根敎授夫婦昨已乘輪返美</h3>
<p>宇宙綫發明家米立根教授、偕其夫人及畢卡特教授·尼赫教授、出印度測量宇宙綫歸國、途决滬演、已於昨日（二十九）上午十一時隨披亞士總統號輪船離滬、離滬前、本埠科學家范鳳源教授會代表中國工程師學會及上海緒大學登輪與之寒暄、表示歡迎、</p>
<p>中國前途至可樂觀</p>
<p>氏原擬在上海交通大學演講、繼以船泊上海、祇二十四小時、忽促未果實行、氏對中國前途、頗抱樂觀、對中日戰事、頗抱同情、又聞知若干猶太人流落滬濱、亦為嘆息、</p>
<p>最初發現係在印度</p>
<p>氏稱最初測最之字宙綫、係一九一〇年在印度首獲發見、嗣在北美洲·南美洲·亦做若干測騐、甚至海洋中之海底、空氣上之同溫層、均會測過、終覺宇宙錢甚為稀薄、</p>
<p>磁性薄弱容易射入</p>
<p>後知地球之磁性、為阻止宇宙綫射入地面之障物、故接近地球之南北極、則測得宇宙綫極少、而在地球表面中央之赤道、因南北極距離相等、磁姓最差、宇宙綫容易射入、故此决赴印度測量、為期三月、結果非常圓滿、</p>
<p>強弱差別測騐方法</p>
<p>氏又告范氏以測騐字宙綫之儀器、並示簡易者、又說明如何繫於汽球上、如何昇入雲香、採取紀錄、蓋用無綫電儀器與精密自動紀錄器、利用宇宙綫可使氣體電離之作用、而眞空管表示電流大小、即知宇宙錢之强弱、</p>
<p>中國學說具有至理</p>
<p>氏稱宇宙綫對於人類之心理與思想、極有密切之關係、人類進化、完全字宙綫所使、往者中國聖賢、常謂天文變象、人間必發生大亂、此說頗有意義、蓋太陽之黑點變化地位、地球之磁綫變換方向、於是宇宙綫射入地面之情形、亦起變花、</p>
<p>地面變化天演造成</p>
<p>人之心理變化、思想變化、及其個人之思想變化、故能引起戰爭、是誠地面人類所為、莫不天演造成、而今後人類生活變化、與宇宙綫之發明、更有影響、聖經佛經皆從光綫說起、其中至理、迨宇宙綫發見後、方始知其一二、</p>
<p>今後變遷影響甚鉅</p>
<p>蓋世界黑暗、人鷄猶為猿類、世界有光綫到達、尤其宇宙光綫、而人類方始由猿類進化為人類、今後世界上文字思想之變遷、與今日研究之宇宙綫殆有甚深切之關係、末氏贈以照片數幀、又謂其研究所得、將在最短時期於紐約發表、蓋此决一切費用、均由紐約康納琪學院供給也、</p>

<h3>奇緣巧遇</h3>
<p>越郡伺家山，有何某者，家本赤貧，傭工度日。每年收割之日，越人往往的作至錢塘沙地為農家僱作短工。何屆時亦與三人同往，坐於茶肆，以待僱者。何戲謂同伴曰：「今歲受僱，必須主人有女，我方肯就，吾則小往也。」同伴皆竊笑之。適有需僱短工之蔣某，正在茶肆覓人，聞其語，頗覺憤懣，迺僱其同伴而獨辭何。同伴謂何曰：「今晚爾無宿處矣，晚飯後可來蔣宅借宿。」何頷之。同伴於晚膳後，白借宿意，蔣堅執小允，即令閉門，同伴亦無如何。蔣雖農家，而豐於財，有女年已及笄，與表弟有私，正的於是晚私逃。臥樓後窗外，本大路也，夜闌人靜，女獨倚窗而望，豈知其表弟因要事不克前來。何至蔣宅投宿，至則見扉已閉，徘徊於園墻之外，女覺下有步履聲，以為表弟至，即由窗洞擲下兩大布包，潛啟後戶而出。何正無法，忽見大包擲下，提之頗重，喜為天賜，即負之而走，女則自後追隨。防有人知，彼此不交言。行二三里，至　凉亭，何頗憊，入亭小憇，女已至前，相視大驚！已欲歸不得，遂與何言明原委，願終事焉。何本未娶，乃至臨浦僦宅居之，將所得之金七八百元，作小本生意，宜家宜室，居然小康。甫於今春為蔣訪知，入門認女，行翁婿懼，復送奩資三百千，此眞奇緣巧遇也。</p>

<h3>談交友</h3>
<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>一個人無分男女人小，活在世界上，誰都免不了要交友。男的有男朋友，女的有女朋友，大的有大朋友，就是小的也有小朋友。</p>
<p>但是，要是交友不愼，是非常危險的。因為，朋友好比是一隻冶鐵的爐子一樣，交着了好的朋友，便好比一塊鐵，投向這隻爐子裏去，可以鍛鍊出有用的鋼來。換句話說，便是說，交着好的朋友，可以增進你的學問，可以矯正你的過失而成為一個有用的人。要是交着了壞的朋友，那你便好比　一塊鐵，投向一隻壞的爐子裏去，非但鍛不出有用的鋼來，並且還會把你毀了！換句話說，就是說交了壞的朋友，不但會引誘你走向墮落毀滅的路上去，並且還會使你原來純潔善良的品性和行為，都跟了同化，轉變。所謂「近朱者赤，近墨者黑」，這樣看來，交友不愼，豈不危險可怕？所以，古人有「君子愼交」之說。</p>
<p>總而言之，一倘人活在世界上，無論男女大小，不能孤居獨處，便莫不需要交友。男的有男朋友，女的有女朋友，大的有大朋友，就是小的也有小朋友，旣如上述。那麼，我希望諸位親愛的小朋友們，你們現在小的時候，交小朋友，也有好壞，固然要謹愼。就是將來大的時候，交大朋友，更有好壞，也一樣的要謹愼纔好啊！</p>
<h3>國姓瓶</h3>
<p>— 剛</p>
<p>國姓瓶這個名字，小朋友對他一定很生疏罷：在這裏我可以告訴你們國姓瓶的來歷，因為這也是値得我們所曉得的。</p>
<p>明末鄭成功抗淸，因為看到泉州的重要，他就在海邊設立了砲臺，常時他所用的火藥都備藏在一個個長形的磁瓶裏，等到火藥完，就把瓶拋在海中，因為唐王賜鄭成功姓朱，所以一般人都稱他為國姓爺，而這種瓶，也就名之為國姓瓶。</p>
<p>國姓瓶到現在已視為珍品，因為在海中，所以或由漁夫網得或由潮水沖來，而以瓶外附有貝殼者為最貴重，貝殼愈多，年代愈久，現在泉州一帶已不易買到，就是有也要數十金一個，尤其是因用來紀念道位民歲英雄的，所以一般人都爭着購買。</p>
<p>國性瓶雖然在我們是覺得生疏，然而也倘得我們所紀念而應該曉得的。</p>
<h3>轟炸</h3>
<p>— 蘚明</p>
<p>自從戰事一發生之後，報紙上便時常可以發見「飛機猛烈轟炸運貨車，但據所得之情報損失甚微……」或「某日，飛機數架在炸某地飛機塲，毀機數架……」之類的消息。庸兒看到了這種不利的消息，便不去讀它，這因為打不起他的興趣來，要是看到我們的飛機釗什麽陣地去轟炸，他倒是非看不可，更去細細閱讀，不肯錯過的，同時又現出欣悅的神情。而且他更是具有一股野心，就是希望他將來成為一個飛機師，帶着炸彈去轟炸他人，的要地，轟的一聲是多麽的爽快！這是他的痴想，他哥哥——宗兒時常的說他。然而現在他對於飛機轟炸的一回事，都是不十分的明瞭，而是他所急需知道的。</p>
<p>「哥哥，轟炸到底是怎麽一回事？是不是很有趣的」？他便這樣的開口問着。</p>
<p>「我曾看過本關於飛機的書籍，它上面告訴我們：飛機轟炸不是件容易的事。我們特常想駕駛着飛機飛到我們的目的地上，就很快的飛瀉下去，等到我們的飛機和目的地的距離飛得接近，便把炸彈對準那目的地擲下去，那便聽得轟的　聲，很準確地把目的地炸毀了。但是那結果却大大地和你的理想相反，實際上那炸彈決不會很隨便的聽你話，落到你所要轟炸的目的地上去的。假如細細地考察從飛機上擲下炸彈的下隊情形，你會發生很奇怪的現象，那知擲下的炸彈和飛機似乎有繫着不可見的綫一般，好像有吸力般的停留在飛機底下，到得那炸彈達到地面上的地點，却和要轟炸的目的地隔離得很遠。那非但沒有收到轟炸的效果，却浪費了一枚炸彈的價値。這是什麼緣故？這現象便證明了牛頓的第一原理——惰性法則：肉為炸彈在飛機上時，它是被飛機帶着一起走的，常你把它擲下它便離開飛機而落下來，然加它不會消失它自己原始在飛機土的速度，在落下的同時，又要繼續完成剛才在空中的運動，便發生了直經（落下）與水平（飛機向前）的兩種運動，結果，炸彈祇得依着弧形曲綫而落下，那便和你所對準的目的地，離開了。所以要使轟炸準確，事前必須計算飛機的連度，炸彈下降的條件，以及風的速度等都有密切的關係。做一個飛機師不是容易的。你倘去做一個侵略他人的飛機師我不贊成，我祗希望你將來做一個為人羣正當服務的飛機師，那才是光榮的！</p>
<h3>親善的動物</h3>
<p>— 淸</p>
<p>動物間的友好關係，有許多是非常奇怪的，譬如：貓看見了烏，就難免食指大動，垂涎欲滴，這是小朋友們所知道的。</p>
<p>然而在澳大利亞的布隆斯威地方，有一個叫做華伊斯的人他養了一隻貓，也養了一頭鷓鴣，而道隻貓興這隻烏，日常相處在一起，就交成了很好的朋友添彼此十分親愛。那隻貓，平日非但沒有一點傷害那頭鷓鴣的意思，却反而處處愛護着伊。小鷓鴣常常甜蜜地睡在貓的懷中，而貓也用了它的爪子緊緊地摟住那隻鷓鴣，這種眞誠的相親相愛的精神，豈是那些心裏兇狠臉上裝着假親善的人所司比，他們雖稱為人，眞是這畜先也不如了！</p>
<h3>新寓言</h3>
<p>— 公超</p>
<p>蝸半在地上慢慢地爬，慢得比最慢的烏驅還要慢。身體後而留着長長的一條黏液，映着日光，發着五顏六色的光彩，蝸牛時常得意地回頭去看，以為：「這是地上的虹，世界上沒有第二種動物能够夠創造」！</p>
<p>他爬着，爬着，忽見一樣慘白色的有環節的東西，像座高高的城墻一般，擋在他的面前，使他个能前進，他仔細看，原來是一條蛇皮，便輕蔑地說：</p>
<p>一修蛇皮，死東西！從前，我和一條活蛇比賽長短，我只伸出了牛個身子，他還比我短一個觸角。我們又比賽快慢，我早已跑到目的地了，他還落後在我的虹裏面，在那兒欣賞她的美哩。活的蛇尚且被我比輸了，哼，你這死東西，也敢擋我的路」！</p>
<p>他的人話還沒有說完，脫下了這皮的　尾小靑蛇，還沒有走遠，回答道：『蝸牛先生，你有這樣長的身體，這樣快的脚步，我倒要領教領教。來，比賽一下！小比的話，就吃掉你」！</p>
<p>蝸牛嚇得把全身子縮進壳裏，好久不敢仲出頭來。</p>
<h3>靑年與老年</h3>
<p>— 趙易林</p>
<p>勿勞林寓言</p>
<p>一個有貪心的靑年，向他的父親說：「我親愛的父親呀！請你待我好一點，告訴我怎樣尋求幸福。」老人說：「這是一種光榮的追求；要想得到幸福，一定要照尋常一樣的工作。把他的才能，日夜都為他的國家服務。」「啊呀！像這樣做生活，是太疲倦了！我要想做一種允榮較少的工作。」「最可靠的方法，就是做奸細。」「這是不名譽的。我想得到財富，但却不願意有罪，也不願意工作。」老人便嘆了一口氣，說道：「那就難了！」</p>
<h3>黑兄弟（八）</h3>
<p>— 一木</p>
<p>那鍋子裏又發出聲音來道：一來，格勒，我的孩子！我仍然好看，快快倒我出來」。但是格勒詫異極了，一動也不動的站在那裏。那聲音帶着」些暴躁，又喊道：「我對你說，快快倒我出來」。格勒仍是一動都不動。那聲音又帶着懇求似的意味說道：「你可能倒我出來嗎？我實在太熱了」。</p>
<p>格勒定了定神，雙手方始活動起來，從爐子上拏起了鍋子，慢慢地倒出那，熔化的黃金來。但是倒出來的卻並不是流質的黃金，只是先伸出兩條美麗的黃金色小腿，拉接着露出了衣服的下裾，接着又瞧見了一對小小的臂膀，末後才是他的老朋友那張金杯上的人頭。這些腿啊，衣裾啊，臂膀啊，人頭啊，逐一從鍋子裏滾出來，一到了地上卻就混合在一起，變做了一個黃金的矮人，約有一英尺半高度。</p>
<p>那矮人很高興的說道：「這樣就好了」！他先伸了仲腿，又伸了伸臂，然後又把他的頭忽上忽下的搖了幾搖，這樣一連有五分鐘光景，兀自不停，彷彿試騰他的全身各部可會拼錯的樣于。格勒一言不發的瞧着，詫異得甚麼似的。那矮人穿着一件金絲織成的緊身衣，織得非常之細，那三角形的光彩，一閃一閃的，好像是珍珠的面部，他的頭髮和鬚子，從衣上披下來，長長的，細細的，一摟一捲的，格勒簡直瞧不出它的盡頭，似乎和空氣相融合了。然而他的臉龐，却沒有他衣服和鬢髮那樣的精細，實在有比組糙，色彩也有些像夾着銅的模樣。</p>
<p>那矮人把自身審查了一遍之後，就將他那一雙尖銳的小眼睛直注在格勒的臉上，足足有一二分鐘之久，才開口說道：「格勒，我的孩子，這不會的」。格勒聽這話很為突兀，也不知道他　什麼意思，便順着他的口氣，很溫和的說道：「先生，不會的嗎」？矮人答道：「是啊，不會的」。說時，把他的帽子壓在他的兩眉上，在室中打了兩個旋子，把他的兩條腿提得很高，着地很重。</p>
<p>格勒對他瞧了一會，覺得沒有住麽害怕的理由，便猜疑似的問道：「先生，你可是我的金杯麽」？矮子猛可的轉過身來，直走到格勒的面前，把身子挺得直直的，放聲答道：「我是黃金江的王」。說了這話。他又轉了兩個大大的旋子，重又回到格勒的面前，站着不動，似乎等格勒的回話。格勒祗得柔聲下氣的說道：「我希望階下一切都很好吧」。</p>
<p>那矮人却並不理會到他客氣的問候，自管說道：「你聽着！我就是你們凡人所說的黃金江的王，我因為中了一位比校强有力的王的法術，才變成你以前所瞧見我的模樣，司是被你放在鍋子裏一熔化，就把我解放了，你和你兩個惡哥哥的行為，我都已瞧到，才使我願意來幫你的忙；你也就應當聽了我的話做去」。</p>

<h3>談平劇中的旗</h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>平劇以歌曲為主，而一舉一動，無不含有舞意，故於劇中道具，亦以便於舞弄者為之。旗，亦為平劇道具主要物件之一，蓋所以表示劇中人行陣征戰官吏動向者，而風雲雨雪，陰陽向背，亦遂多以旗為象微，觀衆自能一目瞭然，有習見而不為人所注意者，如紅門旗，黑門旗，水旗，車旗等多種，摭述之如下：</p>
<p>紅門旗　紅門旗用紅布製成，不施綵繪，為用甚廣，以表示喜氣者，如紅鸞禧中之紅鸞星，及狀元遊街婚嫁等等，悉以此旗為前導。火神出塲，亦時或用之，則以紅色含有火意之故。又如劇中人被斬首，則即以此旗裏其紗帽或髫髻為之，又所以代表赤血淋漓者矣。</p>
<p>黑門旗　黑門旗一名風旗，四方黑色，劇中情景有大風，即以此旗舞動於臺上，故名。用以表示鬼魂御風而行者，則如托兆碰碑七郎出塲時，四人持黑旗前行等等，亦不吉之意，故曰黑門旗。</p>
<p>水旗　水旗以白布為之，上繪水紋，代表水浪，遇有投河，遇救，水戰塲合，皆用此旗。</p>
<p>車旗　車旗於旗面繪車輪形，一人持兩旗，行於中間者，即用以表示來車之意。劇中人乘車者多為旦角，男角惟諸萬亮一人而已。</p>
<p>上述四旗，為平劇中所習見者，近年來武生於好勇鬥狠之餘，有舞綵綢大旗者，繽紛燦爛，目迷五色，用之於兵兇戰危之中，不知何所取義矣。</p>
<h3>「紅樓夢」人選確定　陳雲裳反串賈寶玉　林黛玉薛寶釵兩要角　由袁美雲陳燕燕飾演</h3>
<p>— 銀冰</p>
<p>關於新華公司籌攝全部紅樓夢事，當在三年以前，早就有此計議，因為工程浩大，不無躊躇，直到近」時期，才將原定計劃，付諸實施。這片子在拍演方面，事實上有這樣幾種較大的困難。（一）劇本—書中情節複雜，且極瑣屑，將它分段組織起來，允頭力避沉悶惡俗，這分鏡頭的工作是很不容易。（二）背景—大觀園重樓疊閣，堂皇富麗，佈景工程，異常浩大。（三）演員—書中人物衆多，自十二金釵以下，女角更屬不少，欲求適合個性，支配得當，允非易事。新華於此三項問題，第一貼劇本聞由專家起稿，負資辦理；第二佈景利用僥有花木之勝的丁香花園全部塲地搭置，事半功倍，極為適宜；第三重要演員的支配，頃已大致確定：唯一的中心入物賈寶玉，由陳雲裳反串。林黛玉為身軀嬌弱的袁美雲，薛實釵係玉容豐腴的陳燕燕，王熙鳳一角，仍屬演過「大閙寗國府」片的顧蘭君。</p>
<p>賈寶玉定由女角反串，這確是一個較好的辦法。因為銀幕小生人才，本屬很少，宜於飾演蘊藉風流之寶玉角的，允絕無　人；紅樓夢側重描寫兄女歡愛情節，寶玉如由男角扮飾，亦不免於難為較熱情的澈底表演。陳雲裳嬌憨活潑，猶帶經氣一二分；演此角色，旣甚適合，且似「化身姑娘」般別僥風味，亦是足為紅樓夢片大見生色的。</p>
<h3>斬經堂考（七）</h3>
<p>— 小田</p>
<p>斬經堂一名吳漢殺妻，述演王莽末年時事，劇目為劉秀走國，潼關遭擒，述寃訓子，吳漢殺妻，賢母盡節，棄莽歸漢，而吳漢之妻，則新室公中在莽之女也。全劇唱微調，自麒麟童主演後，頗見風行，後且攝製影片問世，考後漢書果漢傳載：「吳漢，字子顏，南陽宛人也，家貧，給事縣為亭長，王莽末，以賓客犯法，乃亡命至漁陽，資用乏，以販馬自業，往來燕薊間，所至皆交結豪傑，更始立，使使者韓鴻徇河北，或謂鴻曰，吳子顏奇士也，可與計事，鴻召見漢，甚悅之，遂承制拜為安樂令。」是吳漢僅會為更始官，在莽朝則係一馬販，安能尚公主稱駙馬哉。該傳又載，「王郎起，北州擾感，漢素聞光武長者，獨欲歸心，乃說太守彭寵曰，漁陽上谷突騎，天下所聞也，君何不合二郡精銳，附劉公，擊邯鄲，此一時之功也。（中略）寵甚然之，於是遺漢將兵，與上谷諸將並軍而南，所至擊斬王郎帥，及光武於廣阿，拜為偏將軍，旣拔邯鄲，賜號建策侯。」觀此則吳漢之歸漢，起事乃在漁陽，覜見則在廣阿，功蹟則係說彭寵擊王郎，與斬經堂劇情，無一可假借附會，或謂該劇編製，殆出自東漢演義，（余未及觀覽未知信吾，）不知東漢演義　又何所本也。</p>
<h3>華國劇校動態</h3>
<p>— 賀芸</p>
<p>近些日來，話劇的熱鬧，似乎成為孤島上的特殊鳥綴。這現象，可以說是破了歷史的紀錄。其實戲劇，——尤其是話劇——它是一種行動簡單而最含有力量的教育工具，而且隨特隨地可以做着人生社會的反映，所以在新時代的警鐘響遍了大地的今日，它能够如此生氣蓬勃地，自然也是事實的必然。於是乎，劇社劇團之產生，名劇之上演，以及削校之創立，都給了國人很大的興奮。</p>
<p>這時候，華國戲劇專科學校，也跟着和社會見面了。華國劇專，側重話劇範幽以內的各種學術與技巧。例如導演，編劇，表演，化裝，舞蹈，佈景，燈光，効果等，仍在訓練之中，希鐵能於短期間內造就專門人才。</p>
<p>現在，華國已經正式上課了，男女學員共有四十餘人。據說目下一方面除在上課，另一方面並且在排練一多幕的名劇，最近期內有在璇宮劇院演出之說。</p>
<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>楊小樓崇拜李春來（下）</p>
<p>當李演白水灘濤，彼飾十一郎，頭戴草帽團，唸罷「見死不救非丈夫時，身立台口，先作一鞠躬式，迨其頭向上一揚時，草帽圈早已高飛至台頂。其時上面有兩人專司接帽之責，接得者戲後賞洋兩兀，倘均有失，必受李重責。又李每於白日無戲時，常親督觔斗蟲練功，一手持雪茄，　手握皮鞭，每命一人翻觔斗，輒連呼「再來一個，冉來一個」不止。翻者須隨其語聲連續翻下，稍有遲延，或令出而無力冉翻，則必遭李子之鞭笞。春來盛時旣以「白水灘」一劇享名海上，故某日遇李貼演該劇時，小樓特早到後台一時許，在簾內不住向外探視，春來當然格外賣力，等到甩草帽圈時，仍然不用手，要顯顯他頭上的工夫，雖以彼時年邁，略低了些，然而這種絕技，仍是別人作不來的。（天蟾台高，只好在幕前着人接去）又當生爭兩人開打時，二人各持棍之一端，（其實棍」即代表十一郎挑肉所用之扁担，戰時乃用作兵器耳）生凈同時在原地翻一觔斗，同起同落，異常迅捷。立定後，氣不喘，身不搖，那裏能看到他是六旬以外的老頭兒呢。待他這塲完啦，剛一跨進後台，楊老板急忙到跟前，拉拉春來的手，接着又把大拇哥（即拇指）伸了幾伸，嘴裏連呼曰一老英雄，老英雄一，春來固面有得色，而和此老配演的鞠德奎，（飾靑面虎）也覺得面子很有光彩呢。</p>

<h3>怎樣解瘊家庭經濟　應從大處着眼小處着手</h3>
<p>— 風</p>
<p>家庭問題目前成為一般的最嚴重問題，這是戰時的特殊現象，不能以常道論。在平時，每一個家庭，有正常的收入，而物價也有一定的水準，家庭經濟發生了問題，那或由於處置小當，或家庭的成員無謂的浪費所致，那末最軍要的辦法，就是個人加以調整。目前的問題則異是，物價的高漲，大多數雖節無可節，省無可省，仍小能維持一家的生計，其原因決不是個人的過失，而是社會所造成。因此，從個人方而去解決，那是無濟於事的，這尚有待於社會的共同解決。</p>
<p>就一般的情形講，各國一當戰事發生，主要的日用食物，如食糧燃料等，都由政府加以統制，對於貯藏的數量，事先加以統計，有餘，則謀如何處置，不足則謀如何調劃，並限定最高價額（Maximumpriee），不致使日用必需品的價格在漲，並嚴禁投機，以免市塲混亂。上海是在特殊情况之卜，這一步手續，根添就沒有做到。去年地方當局，對於食糧提出限價，這也是事後的亡羊補牢，而不是事前的未雨綢繆。等到今年市塲再起紛擾，而米的限價早已打破。煤的抬高價格，也無法　止，棧房中雖儲有大量煤斤，因為棧單在投機者手中作為他們操縱居奇的手段，每　煤非二百餘元無法購得，於是煤的價格，突飛猛漲，鬧成空前少有的局面，雖經工商界領袖的出而作壓平價格的種種努力，所收成效，實屢不多。</p>
<p>嚴厲制裁投機，這當然是目前最重要的措施，不過僅僅這樣的消極辦法，尚不能解決目前物價的高漲問題，還有待租界當局及工商界的領袖，籌集大量基金，對於主要物品調杳現有的存數，不足時，大量的購入，以謀調劑。上海民食調節委員會籌集基余集團購米，可說是近來調整米價最有成續的團體行動。不過這一辦法，尚嫌不普遍，能夠拿出十元購米的，就其本身講，已不是一般中等以上的人能力所及，在馬路上看到糴平米的行列有半里路長，這些人都是拿了胥箕縐五升一斗以餬口的，他們當然沒有能力購上一石一石貯藏在家內，以為食用，集團購米的辦法，當然把這些人排擠在圈外。平糶的辦法，對於這些人，，是大有帮助，這種辦法，須持之能久，高風潮來時，實行平糶，等到風稍平息時，又吿中輟。這也不是澈底的解決辦法。所以這問題應該通盤籌措，以求其普遍而收效宏大，這種辦法可分幾方面：第一上海各大公司各大工廠的僱主，可就其盈餘範圍以內，撥出基金，眺買日用必需品，在不以營利為目的範圍內，分賣與八其職工，這在僱主方面，不過一舉手之勞，而在職工方面，則可購得比市塲上要低廉得多的日用品。第二，上海自抗戰以來，游資充斥，這些游資，不加正當利用，而多作操縱投機之用，如果這些游資能如過去信用合作方式，作為投資消費合作社之用，不知道對於社會福利要有利得不知多少倍。在這時期，消費合作社的組識，實有提倡的必要。不過所謂合作事業，不限於消費合作，其他如醫藥合作事業增進個人身體健康，及教育台作事業，教靑子女，以節省個人負担，及儉德台作會社等，都能對於家庭經濟上有所帮助，也應該捉倡。並且合作社的基本精神，是所謂民主政治，當此提倡憲政的時候，這種合作社的組織，也是培養民主精神好辦法。這一個也是更値得我們提倡，而來共同研究，以便在今日畸形社會下，家庭經濟，有一個比較合理的解決。</p>
<h3>家庭經濟的調整</h3>
<p>— 嚴正</p>
<p>把家庭相社會碳格地劃分開來是平由能的。同樣，家庭經濟無時無刻子受社會經濟的影響。在目前非常時期，非常環境中，社會經濟給予家庭經濟的影響　別明顯。家庭的預算隨時被飛躍的物價和暴漲的房租所破毀了。為了生存，不得冷竭　尋求家庭經濟的調整，這種情形在一班靠些微的俸給生活者　間尤其顯得尖銳化。他們沒有恒產，沒倘保障，意志薄弱些的就把收入拿到歹土去作孤注一擲，那結局當然是失敗的。所以，欲求家庭經濟的調整，首先有待乎社會經濟的改善，如抑制物價，平定房租“。此外，下列幾點對於家庭經濟的調節，或不無裨益</p>
<p>（一）合作社　加入合作社。於家庭經濟非常有利。本埠各　多有同人聯誼社的組識。社中有附設合作社的，每人出一二元錢，即為股東，經常享受集團購米，煤及日用必需品的利益。年終還可派得紅利。足以補救個人財力不足的缺陷。（各　中如尙無此類組織，籲請火速設立，由本　領袖創議或職工自動組織均可！）</p>
<p>（二）用品交換　記得本埠某婦女團體曾有這樣的個組織。以我所不要的，易人不要問我所要的，一舉兩得　　便。此事也可通過各業聯誼社而實現，於家庭經濟很　補　。</p>
<p>（三）生產　在目前，只節流而不開源，家庭經濟只有日趨緊迫，生活也只有日趨艱難。但開源也眞不容易！最正軌的辦法莫如：寫稿，擔任來餘抄寫，夜校教帥等。婦女們除上項職業外（或力不能就上項職業的）很可以替人編織一些手工的製品。最近有一班人，鑒於美國需要我國手工織物日殷，就廣告招請生熟手女工。那優點是在於可以把織物拿到自己的家裏做，一點不妨碍例行家事。每雙工資少也有五，六角，多則一兩元，每日編織一雙，一月也就很可觀了。</p>
<p>（四）娛樂　雖然，在可能範圍內還須求身心的愉快。欲求身心的愉快，莫如看書。旣可陶治性情，又得增進智誠。慈淑大樓三樓新亞　書館，交一二元保證金，即可長牛免費借閱。（不借，保證金隨時可請求發還　很適合節的之旨。至於小孩們，在星期日可帶到鄰近的兒童公園去，大人們也藉此得以消滌一下一週來的煩勞，不費分文！</p>

<h3>抑低物質的享受</h3>
<p>— 余查芸</p>
<p>家庭經濟的榮枯，固然是基於社會經濟的榮枯，和物品產銷量的均衡為依歸的，然而，一個家庭的經濟支配是應该有相當的自主力，因為生活上的物質享受是有仲縮性的。可是，在目前的上海，尤其是中下市民層，每一個家庭的經濟支配權，可說得完全操在少數有資力者之手，簡言之：就是日用品的囤戶和市價操縱者控制了我們的生命。</p>
<p>在這種社會現狀下，我們當然不能束手待斃，我們得掙扎，得謀生守。其方式雖因家庭而異，但主要的方法總不外乎：精神方面，同舟共濟（家屬的）：享用方面，截長補短，以平衡收支的差額。不過，這兩個辦法言之不難，行之却不易。前者須要有諒解心，後者更須要有相當時間的修養，若到物價高漲的今日才言節的，那末「臨渴掘井」的跺急與苦悶是很難消受的。我因為在兩年前就開始節的，所以在現在這種艱困的環境下，到並小覺得怎樣痛苦，雖然我只有五十元收入，要養活一家四口。這並不是我的眼光遠大，實在是受了客觀環境的刺激所致。大的在八一三之後，我有菲干失業與留職停薪的親友，他們對於日常生活上不必要的吃仍要吃，不必要的穿仍就要穿，而同時，心田裏也就充滿了不必要的憂慮！這就是所謂「打腫嘴巴冲胖子」。因此，我時刻自問：假使我失了業就怎樣？</p>
<p>於是乎：我從那時候起，就未雨綢繆，實行　鍛鍊胃口」，將飯菜山三輩三素而减為二葷二素，三個月後，更减為一葷二素，從去年夏季到現在則為一樣素菜。起初是非常難受，後來也漸漸地習慣了。所以現在百物昂貴，而我所受的影響的確有限。</p>
<p>現在的米，煤，汕等雖昂貴，但我五十元收入（尚有臨時津貼八元）仍足够應付。每月除房租十元外，所餘四十八元分配如下：米半担二十元，煤球約八十市斤四元八角（中養曉畢即用煤屑和水固封爐口），油四斤四元，一樣蔬菜每天一角，計三元，小孩學費五元，其他如肥皂火柴等另用三元，尙有八元餘，備為鞋襪應酬之用。</p>
<p>這尙係目前的物價支出的實況，在若干月之前，物價尙未如此昂貴而我也是這樣生活着，所儲蓄下來的餘何尚未動用分文。今而後，我當然還要繼續鍛鋉吃苦，鑒於過去節約所收得的效果，我現在更要節約，以免將來的痛苦。我非但不做新衣，在將來，還想於飯中摻些山薯，芋艿之類以减少米的消耗量。至於電影，香烟，打牌，傭婦，吃零食，燙髮，脂粉等等一切無意識的消耗，當然還要維持兩年前的計劃，根本戒絕。</p>

<h3>家庭經濟常識　廢物利用</h3>
<p>— 張鎮山</p>
<p>近數月來，上海社會生活已因物價漫無止境的上漲，提高得超越了水準二三倍以至七八倍，使多數市民的生產與消費的量，都有很遠的距離。處在這樣艱因的環境下，要平衡收支的差額，除了期望於當局抑平畸形上漲的物價外，我們只有充分地利用時間（也即是人力）與廢物來抵制牠的威脅，以穩定家庭經濟。</p>
<p>目前使我們最感威脅的就是米探兩項，關於煤，我們就可利用垃圾來减少煤球的消耗量，共法將每日掃除之垃圾儲於舊缸中，待有相當數量，即飾去共中泥土，把有可燃性的渣滓用水浸透，摻和些許煤屑（可用堆煤球的地方所剩落的），攪拌勻均，做成煤球狀，曝晒於日光下，待乾燥後即可應用，每一爐煤球可配置十分之四（即六個眞煤球配四個垃圾煤球）一同燃燒，火力並不减弱。</p>
<p>其次，蔬菜上所剝下的邊皮與菜根，也可利用，不必拋棄，以水洗爭後，切成粒狀，和入米中同煮，成飯後，食之旣可减少米的消耗量，又有撲鼻的異香，且更常有充分的生活素供體內吸收。毛巾久用之後，破爛處必為中央，而四方及兩端均各完好，可以從中間剪開，分為兩段，將兩端用經縫合，變中央為兩端，變兩端為中央，再將破爛部份修剪一下，又是一條好毛巾，不過縮短了一些長度而已，即不用以洗臉，亦可洗碗，抹棹，揩玻璃。牙刷與桃破至不能冉用時，可作擦皮鞋的器具。餅乾廳可製煤球爐。衣服破至不能穿時，可將完好部份拆開，山滾水消毒改做面巾或兒童涎圍。總而言之：在家庭中是沒有廢物，每一件東西都有兩三種用處，只在於人肯去利用與吾。若處處節省，物物利用，非但於家庭絆濟有裨益，而也可收得問接輔助當局抑平物價的效果。</p>
<h3>節省一得</h3>
<p>— 塵</p>
<p>節省方法頗多，據作者所想到者有二：</p>
<p>（一）依經濟學上講，物的效用測度，有價値與價格之分，譬如粥能療飢，這是牠永久不變的價値，若僧多粥少，牠的價格」就貴；反之粥多僧少，牠的「價格」就賤。換言之，價格依照供求定律而變，價値則吾。因為物愼是價格，所以我們就可利用這一點。舉一個例：近來黃魚剛剛上市，價錢當然貴，我們等到黃魚大批來的時候再吃，其營養沒有二樣，而價錢却便宜許多。待後黃魚漸漸地少下去，價錢又要漸漸地貴起來，我們就可以把醃着的便宜黃魚來朶顧，雖然味兒差一點，這是「醃字在經濟學上的意義。他如秋季最多的大閩蟹，我們就把牠製成冬季的醉蟹，冬季最多的大靑菜，把牠製成春季的醃菜，或者把牠製成紹興人所做的霉乾菜，一舉手之勞，省錢不少。</p>
<p>（二）不要拋棄還有點用處的東西，這些東西通常叫作「廢物，」其實還有一點用塲，所以此地不用「廢」字，例如食品罐頭，如不欲保留，可以賣給收舊貨的，也値幾分錢；或者作為盛零碎食品的器具。又如認為嚴無用的垃圾，可霉爛後使生沼氣而燃燈，但這是要設不可。又如在新年，大概每家終吃點長生果瓜子，這種閒食，牠的殼，就可以用為燃料。古人有句話：「牛溲馬渤，醫者不棄。」應當時時刻旋留心所謂「廢物利用。」</p>
<h3>「戰時麵包」</h3>
<p>— 川</p>
<p>放開眼睛來看，目前上海鐵種生活艱難狀態，原是歷史上常見均事實，听不司者，各國並不像上海這樣什操縱投機者的黃橫行而已。在上次大戰中，戰爭一開始，協的國方面即謠傳德國即將發生食物的恐慌。可是因為德國的嚴厲统制食糧，人民並沒有如協的國相像的那樣短時期就遭受了飢餓。德國在戰爭開始後，就訂立物品限價及麵包條例。於是有所謂「戰時麵包」規定，那就是限制一切麵包商製成麵包時，白麵粉的麵包，應加百分之下的裸麥粉，而製裸麥粉麵包時，則應參加百分之五的番薯粉。這種麵包下自平民，上自當時的德皇夫婦，及在前綫的太子，也都吃這種麵包。德國食糧，因協的國海上的封鎖，在一開戰時，就感覺不足，可是足以支持叫年之久的原因，就在政府統制有方，與人民在食糧方面的節省。目前在上海這樣的特殊情况下，政府統制，當然權力有所不能及，上海市民，應該用集體的力量來制裁投機者，以改進個人的經濟。同時那些少數寫有階級，也應該節省物力以之供獻國家。</p>
<h3>衣服處理瑣談</h3>
<p>— 金菊卿女士</p>
<p>在都市上生活之家庭婦女，其對於日常措置，不論家居或出外，就經濟與其他合理化上，在在有可注意之處。關於衣服一項，作者就個人經騐，或平常與親戚朋友互談所得者，的有幾項：</p>
<p>一，毛織之衣忌貼肉着，因毛織之物，多洗而易縮，不洗不合衛生，且動物類之繼維，易使皮膚發癢。</p>
<p>二，服之用夾裏者，最好用眞絲綢，舊衣之夾裏，倘係眞絲討，切不可棄去，如用舊夾裏二層，稍稍用綫直仃釘，放在新夾裏內，成一三層夾裏衣服，可抵薄棉衣之暖，輕而貼身。</p>
<p>三，衣襪要常洗，貼身汗衫褲及襪，最好每日換，洗時不必大用氣力，肥皂亦可省用，夜間睡衣，宜用棉布製，且須寬大，舊衣亦可，睡時不可着襪，如是則衣襪常新而耐久，且合衛生。</p>
<p>四，衣服紗巾，洗後宜用日光曬，最好用熨斗燙過，不但美觀上有關，且熱力能殺微菌，如以洗凈紗巾，貼在玻璃窗上，或磁磚上者，最不合宜，棉衣棉被，亦須常常用日光曬過。</p>
<p>五，冬日舖牀，在稷棚之上，先舖舊報紙五六張，（申報紙張好不易碎）再將褥予舖上，紙為不傳熱而不透風物，且可保護褥子，不與稷棚相摩擦。</p>
<p>買燈泡的條件</p>
<p>燈泡是每一個家庭中應用的東西。但是燈泡是用以發電的，所以燈泡的是否能彀省電，就很値得我們注意了。有許多人以為要省費祗要買價廉的燈泡，其實每一隻燈泡，應該發出十足的光度。譬如說，一隻二十五瓦特的燈泡，就應該發二十五瓦特的燈光。如果牠只能發出二十瓦特的燈光，那末有五瓦特的電費是白費了，如果一隻一十五瓦特的燈泡，要用了三十瓦特的電，方能發也二十五瓦特的燈光，就要多費五瓦特的電費了，因此有許多自作聰明的人，以為買了幾隻價廉的燈泡，就算是省了許多錢，其實在無形中要損失許多錢，所以要求眞正的經濟，在用燈泡的時候，決不能單在燈泡的價目上打算。</p>
<h3>戰時物品統制</h3>
<p>— 浣</p>
<p>（一）香港的物價統制</p>
<p>諺云：「巧婦難為無米之炊」，所以當此米珠薪桂之時，除去每人每家實行節的外，還須得有負責的當局，厲行統制，吾則，無論如何經濟，也無法過此難關。</p>
<p>在上海雖有所謂「限價」的規定，但奸商陽奉陰遠，未見實效。至於統制機關的組織，根本就沒有，近聞法和界組織一委員會，以抑平物價，這是市民的福音，我們是「企予望之」的。</p>
<p>在香港，則歐戰發生後，即頒動統制物價的條例，所以迄今物悄並無直上雲霄的現象。例如最近白塔油毗售一元三角一磅，十四盎斯的腐牌鍊乳五角一罐，勒吐精乳粉一磅一元一角九分，加利福尼亞的沙田魚三角七分　罐。其他米糧及必　品，更沒有躉積居奇。所以我們很希望上海當局，急速有這種統制機關的成立。</p>
<p>（二）上次歐戰中英國的食物節制</p>
<p>當第一次世界人戰時英國根臄笠學原則，在不害康健範圍之內，每星期的食物，成人除食穀類十二盎斯，肉二磅，白脫油，植物油，猪油等脂肪質十盎斯，搪八盎斯外，其麵包的重量如下：</p>
<p>做煩重工作的男子為八磅</p>
<p>做普通工業工作的男子為七磅</p>
<p>做寫字檯工作的男子四磅八盎斯</p>
<p>做煩重工作的婦女為五磅</p>
<p>做普通工作的婦女為四磅</p>
<p>做寫字檯工作的婦女為三磅八盎勘</p>
<h3>一個薪給工作者的　家計調查</h3>
<p>— 厲石</p>
<p>下表所列是根據筆者——一個薪給工作者——五年來家用記賬整理而得之結果。表中數字係每年各月平均實支各項生活費用百分比之分配，實數並未列入。因本文目的在提供一個薪給工作者的家庭生活費決算分配之比例，從而分析其生活程度之變遷。此一報告旣係調查性質，如將實數列上似反無意義。</p>
<p>平均每月支出各項生海費百分分配</p>
<p>上表所列生活費，在開始記賬之時，即按各國生活費研究慣例，分為食品。衣着。房租·燃料及雜項五類。房租之中包括燈光及用水，在上海租房居住者多係如此。燃料係供取暖及烹飪之用。雜項內又分訂閱·圖書·添置傢具·醫藥衛生·交際及娛樂，其他雜費如女僕工資，及時別開支，如川資或借出寺六目。此項分目乃依筆者家庭實際預算酌定，並非有一定標準。在此五年中筆者薪酬所入並無增减，亦應敘明。</p>

<h3>Japanese Reinforcements for Changzi Defeated</h3>
<p>Tongguan: The Chinese army stormed into Changzi on the evening of the 23rd of last month and engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese for many days, killing a large number of Japanese troops. On the 26th, a unit of Japanese troops from Guancunzhen, northeast of Changzhi, attempted to reinforce Changzi but was intercepted by the Chinese army along the way.

<p>Luoyang: Since this week, contact has been constantly made on the Jinan front line, and the Chinese army has maintained an absolute advantage, inflicting heavy damage on the Japanese. A unit of Japanese troops from Xiaxian attempted to invade Fujiacun (east of Xiaxian) several times on the 21st and 23rd of last month under the cover of artillery fire. A certain unit of the Chinese army calmly responded and fought fiercely to intercept them, and the Japanese retreated in defeat each time, leaving behind more than a hundred corpses. Since the 15th, the Japanese have been constantly reinforcing Zhangdianzhen (southeast of Anyi) with frequent transportation. A certain unit of the Chinese army preemptively destroyed the highway north of Zhangdianzhen to cut off the Japanese transportation and supply line, and simultaneously launched attacks on Zhangdianzhen, Ershililing (south of Jiexian), and other places, killing many enemy soldiers. Between Linfen and Fushan, the Japanese are also busy transporting and deploying troops, and the Chinese army is stepping up its attacks. In addition, in southeastern Jin, in the Changzhi and Huguan areas, the Japanese are actively forcing civilians to build the Baijin Highway. A certain unit of the Chinese army attacked Baodianzhen (south of Tunliu) on the 23rd and 24th, killing a number of Japanese troops in Changzi, causing extreme panic among the Japanese. (2nd Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Joint Office of the Four Banks Actively Handles Agricultural Loans; Outline of Measures Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Approval; Priority to Be Given to Provinces in the Rear Area</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Joint Office of the Four Banks recently convened various agricultural loan agencies to discuss unifying organizations, improving efficiency, expanding funds, and actively handling agricultural loans. The proposed measures have been approved by the board of directors of the office and named "(Central Trust Bureau, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank) Agricultural Loan Measures Outline for the 29th Year." It has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The content focuses on: (A) striving for universal loan coverage, (B) increasing the amount of loans, (C) simplifying procedures, (D) providing loans even in areas where farmers' organizations have not been established, (E) each bank should actively participate in production guidance, and (F) local party and government agencies should cooperate in investigation, publicity, and advocacy, and the loan projects should be expanded to eight categories: production, supply and marketing, storage and pledge, farmland water conservancy, transportation tools, farmland purchase, and sideline promotion. Priority will be given to the provinces in the rear area, with Sichuan and Kangding as the primary areas. Other provinces will be handled by the Joint Office of the Four Banks at its discretion. The cooperative treasuries originally established by the Agricultural Bank in various places will continue to operate. As for the future allocation of loan funds, the Central Trust Bureau will receive 15%, Bank of China 25%, Bank of Communications 15%, Farmers Bank 35%, and Agricultural Bank 10%. The total amount of loans has already exceeded 100 million yuan in the past, and it can be greatly increased in the future. With the cooperation and mutual assistance of each bank, focusing on rural construction, the benefits will naturally be great. However, how to universally penetrate into rural areas still requires the cooperation of party and government agencies in investigation, publicity, and advocacy. In addition to instructing the Ministry of Finance to approve the measures, the Executive Yuan has also issued orders to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the governments of Sichuan, Kangding, Guizhou, Yunnan, Shaanxi, and Gansu to comply with and assist in the implementation.

<h3>American Diplomacy and European Peace</h3>
<p>The two major continents of Europe and Asia are engaged in wars that are destroying culture and slaughtering humanity. Almost all major countries are directly involved in the war. Only Italy and the United States are able to remain neutral and stand outside the vortex of the war. However, Italy and the United States are inevitably affected by the war in all aspects, including politics, diplomacy, and military affairs. Being called neutral does not mean being isolated and able to take care of oneself!</p>
<p>The two sets of wars in Europe clearly have different developments. The war between Britain, France, and Germany has lasted for six months, but apart from naval submarine activities, encounters between aircraft and reconnaissance teams, and small-scale artillery battles, there has not been a single decent battle to date. The Soviet-Finnish war is more intense. The Red Army, relying on its sophisticated military equipment, is fiercely attacking. Although Finland has favorable weather and terrain and can mount a strong resistance, its national strength is limited. If it cannot obtain external assistance, it may be difficult to resist the Soviet Union's aggression and maintain national independence. So far, these two sets of wars seem to be fought separately and not conspiring with each other. In fact, their related relationships are closely connected. Especially after Germany and the Soviet Union signed a trade agreement recently, the actual cooperation between the two countries is close and subtle, and it cannot be explained by superficial appearances. Therefore, the evolution of the European war may lead to new dramatic changes and create new situations at any time. However, modern warfare is three-dimensional warfare. The complexity of various forces and conditions makes the space vast and the time prolonged. It is by no means possible to immediately determine who wins and who loses with three or five straightforward battles. Therefore, historical knowledge and lessons alone are not enough to predict the future of this European war. Not to mention the results of the war, not to mention martial arts, not to mention the impact of gains and losses, there is no way to estimate them in advance. Even in terms of the duration, there is no way to foresee how long it will last. What can be asserted is that if it is left to military evolution alone, it will not be resolved in a short time. In order to seize the opportunity to win in a long-term war, the belligerent countries are doing everything possible to seek abundant resources to the point of being inexhaustible. Therefore, in addition to intensifying their military actions, the current belligerent countries are also working hard to improve their economic structures and increase their general strength in order to adapt to the needs of a long-term war. At the same time, they are doing their best in diplomacy, wooing allied countries in the hope of protecting their operations and winning victories from the flanks, and even obtaining supplies of resources from other countries from the front. The United States is the actual leader among capitalist countries and possesses great economic power sufficient to influence the world situation. If the European belligerent countries obtain the support of the United States in terms of resources, they will almost have grasped the absolute advantage of winning, or at least have obtained more opportunities to win. The problem is that the United States is not a soulless tool. It has likes and dislikes towards both sides of the belligerent countries, and it is not a blind, religious-style partiality. It also has its own interests, which must be measured by extraordinarily complex conditions. Therefore, the future diplomatic trends of the United States will inevitably have a major impact on the evolution of the European situation, and may even have a final decisive impact!</p>
<p>The United States' enthusiasm for peace and its efforts to safeguard democracy are deeply understood and recognized by everyone except for madmen. Its steady, firm, and strong diplomatic actions are also seen and heard by everyone who is not crazy. We understand these two points. If we base it on historical knowledge and lessons, it seems easy to determine the attitude and ultimate trend of the United States towards the current European war. In the early stages of the last European war, the United States maintained a neutral position. Later, it eventually joined the Allied Powers, thus determining the fate of German militarism. Although the situation this time is different from the division of friends and enemies in 1914, and it is also different from the early stages of the last European war, the various basic tones, whether emotional, beliefs, or reason and interests, are generally not much different from the past. The difference that we cannot ignore the most is that although history seems to be cyclical, it is not a replay. The lessons of the past are painful, and human reason is progressing. This is true for the belligerent countries Britain, France, Germany, and the Soviet Union, and even more so for the neutral United States. Because of this difference, there is a vastly different performance now compared to the last European war. For example, recently, the United States, with its belief in peace, its neutral status, and the weight of its magnificent resources as an international voice, resolutely adopted active diplomatic actions towards the European war. There are two aspects to the action: first, U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles traveled to Europe on the 17th of last month and will visit the authorities of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy one after another. He has now left Mussolini and is going to meet Hitler. Second, Secretary of State Hull stated that he would hold talks with neutral countries to jointly discuss "the establishment of a sound international economic system" and "the reduction of armaments." It is now proceeding calmly and cautiously. These two actions have different directions and different targets. The content and scope are also different. However, their spirit and motivation are naturally the same as their embryos, and the plans and steps are naturally the same as their categories, and the desired effects are naturally the same as their destinations. It goes without saying that President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull are strategizing, issuing instructions, and making decisions. Special Envoy Welles is also one of the few talents in the United States with political acumen and diplomatic skills, and is known for his familiarity with the international situation and is highly valued by President Roosevelt. This mission to go abroad to Europe will surely obtain true insights into the overall world situation as a solid basis for the United States to mediate the European war. Roosevelt warned the American people not to expect too much from Welles' trip. This is the passion revealed by an experienced and prudent statesman, and it cannot diminish our perception of Welles' mission. Of course, we should not think that Welles' trip will be able to reverse the situation, but if the United States does not stay out of it, it will be a major factor in stabilizing the international situation no matter what!</p>
<h3>French Authorities Indicate No Intention to Renew Trade Agreement with Japan; Bombing of Yunnan-Vietnam Railway Arouses French Public Outrage; Industry Worries About Future of Trade with France</h3>
<p>Tokyo: According to Japanese sources, although the Japanese Ambassador to France, Sawada, is continuing negotiations with the French Foreign Ministry, the French authorities have indicated that they have no intention of renewing the Franco-Japanese trade agreement. Japanese people here believe that this attitude of the French side is due to the following two factors: (1) Since the outbreak of the European war, France has felt the need to fundamentally adjust its overseas trade relations; (2) French public sentiment has been angered by Japan's bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, and the French government has been swayed by this public opinion. Japanese business circles say that France is trying to get closer to Britain in economic relations and adjust the economic system of Britain and France on the basis of a group. It is reported that France is now working hard to jointly establish self-sufficiency between its country and its colonies with Britain in terms of trade relations. A license system is being implemented for goods imported into British Congo and French Morocco. Japanese cotton fabrics have actually been banned from being exported to all parts of Africa mentioned above. The railway government also plans to strengthen its restrictions on exports in order to reserve raw materials for its munitions industry. However, because the main goods that Japan exports to France and its colonies are canned salmon and textiles, both of which are important daily necessities for Japan, it is difficult for the French to implement severe restrictions. At the same time, the French side seems to be seeking to avoid preventing the export of various raw materials to Japan without reason, so as not to cause retaliatory measures from the Japanese side. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese political circles are quite worried about the fate of the Franco-Japanese trade agreement in the future, and they are deeply afraid that it will fall into a state of nothingness like the relations between the United States and Japan. The Franco-Japanese trade agreement will expire on March 15. After the expiration, the French side may refuse to renew it. Since the outbreak of the European war, France has felt the need to readjust its foreign trade relations. Furthermore, since Japan has repeatedly bombed the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, French public opinion has also been quite indignant. (2nd United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris: According to hints from responsible parties, if Japan attempts to prevent goods from being transported into China via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, the Allied Powers will protest against Japan's use of the Siberian Railway to transport goods into Germany. It is reported that the goods transported from Japan's Shanxi Siberia Railway to Germany include high-grade steel, cotton cloth, and food. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan Plans to Send Hirota to China to Serve as Special Envoy to the "Puppet Regime"</h3>
<p>Tokyo: According to the "Hochi Shimbun," former Japanese Prime Minister Hirota Koki is the most likely candidate for the Japanese ambassador when the Wang regime is established in Nanjing. The Japanese government originally planned to send a military man as the first ambassador to the Wang regime, but the plan was abandoned due to "obstacles." Konoe Fumimaro, Hiranuma Kiichiro, and Matsuoka Yosuke were also candidates for "Ambassador to China," but they "cannot accept this post." "The special envoy sent to China will not only carry the government's congratulations to the "Wang regime," but he will also be authorized with broad powers to adjust the main relations between the "new regime" and Japan. Sending a special envoy to the "new regime" is Japan's de facto recognition of the "new regime," which is the same as the dispatch of General Muto Nobuyoshi as a special envoy when "Manchukuo" was established.

<h3>U.S. Export-Import Bank Allocates Huge Sums to Lend to Finland, Sweden, and Norway; Loans to China Will Also Be Implemented Soon</h3>
<p>Washington: U.S. Construction Bank Chairman Jones announced yesterday that the Export-Import Bank's board of directors has issued 20 million U.S. dollars to Finland, 15 million U.S. dollars to Sweden, and 10 million U.S. dollars to Norway to purchase various goods other than military supplies within the United States. It is generally expected that the bank will allocate 20 million U.S. dollars to lend to China. Jones received a wireless telegraph from President Roosevelt on the cruiser "Tuscaloosa," guaranteeing that he would sign the bill passed by both houses of Congress to increase the Export-Import Bank's capital by 100 million U.S. dollars when he returned to the White House today.

<h3>Chongqing Actively Evacuates Population</h3>
<p>Chongqing: As the Spring Festival is approaching and visibility is clear, in order to avoid unnecessary loss of life and property due to Japanese air raids, the authorities are currently evacuating Chongqing residents on a large scale. The Chongqing Defense Command stipulates that the following must leave the city: a number of government offices, many entertainment venues, and all schools. With the closure of public entertainment venues, which has reduced the vitality of the city, the evacuation process is easier to implement. The evacuation of government agencies is divided into three phases. Those belonging to the first phase have already been moved out. Many other agencies will move out soon. The authorities are also urging shops to transport some of their goods to neighboring towns in order to reduce losses during bombing. Although the air raid shelters here can accommodate 200,000 people, the Defense Command still intends to reduce the population to between 80,000 and 100,000 as much as possible. Therefore, Chongqing is expected to become an uninteresting city in the short term, and the theaters, movie theaters, brothels, and Western-style restaurants that have been ordered to close will all be reduced. (2nd Chongqing Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to news here today, in order to facilitate the evacuation of Chongqing residents as soon as possible, the municipal government authorities here plan to close all theaters, movie theaters, teahouses, brothels, restaurants, and places that only provide unnecessary consumption and entertainment, believing that this is the only effective way to evacuate civilians. Currently, one of the three movie theaters in Chongqing has already been closed. (2nd United Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Secret Organizations in Sichuan Form "National Strength Association"</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to the Ta Kung Pao today, sixteen secret organizations in Sichuan have now united to become one organization, named the "National Strength Association," to openly engage in anti-Japanese activities. They held an inaugural meeting here yesterday. From now on, the secret organizations have abandoned their underground secret lives and become open民间团体. It is reported that all members of these sixteen secret organizations reach 7 million people. It is also reported that all secret organization members in China, including men and women, number no less than 20 million. They are roughly divided into three factions: the Red Gang, the Green Gang, and the Red Spear Society. They have a history of several centuries in China and have always engaged in anti-Manchu revolutionary activities during the Manchu Qing Dynasty. (2nd United Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Four Nations of England, America, France, and the Soviet Union Will Certainly Continue to Assist China. The Gathering of the Four Ambassadors in Chongqing is Not Purely Coincidental. Is There Hope for Justice to Prevail? - Editorial from the Central Daily News</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The Central Daily News editorial, titled "The Four Ambassadors in Chongqing," expressed confidence that the four nations of England, America, France, and the Soviet Union will undoubtedly continue to provide assistance and sympathy to China. It stated that during this period of resistance, China has only one enemy, with all others being friendly nations. Among these friendly nations, England, America, France, and the Soviet Union are providing the most profound sympathy and assistance to China, which is hardly questionable. British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, French Ambassador Cosme, and Soviet Ambassador Pan Youxin are already in Chongqing, and now American Ambassador Johnson has also arrived. This is the first time all four ambassadors have been in Chongqing simultaneously during China's resistance. England is an empire with interests spanning the globe. At this time of China's resistance, turmoil in Europe has significantly impacted British activities in the Far East. However, British policy, except for occasional excessive caution, consistently supports justice and the Nine-Power Treaty as a whole, which is commendable. Before and after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, England provided China with valuable assistance. We firmly believe that were it not for the European conflicts, British assistance to China would undoubtedly be far greater than it is today. Eden once stated that British assistance to China could proceed in step with the United States. We firmly believe that this statement remains the policy of the current British government. France is also a signatory to the Nine-Power Treaty. Its strength and influence in the Far East may not match those of England, America, and the Soviet Union, but France's sympathy for China and its support for international justice and the Nine-Power Treaty are in no way inferior to other nations. France is committed to maintaining justice and peace in Europe and also to maintaining justice and peace in the Far East. The Soviet Union, as China's neighbor and also a strong Asian power, plays a crucial role in this Sino-Japanese war. Although the Soviet Union has strived to adhere to a policy of peace in recent years, it has not adopted a policy of indifference towards the Sino-Japanese War. It has shown sympathy for China and, for the sake of justice, has also provided assistance. The Soviet Union's sympathy for China and its opposition to those who seek dominance in the Far East will undoubtedly not change. As for the United States, it is the initiator of the Nine-Power Treaty. American public opinion, which supports justice, is strong and influential, and the relationship between the Chinese and American people has always been friendly. Although the United States does not wish to be drawn into the vortex of war, it will certainly not allow Japanese militarists to control Asia and destroy the policy that the United States has followed in the Far East for fifty years. The profound friendship and assistance of the United States are deeply appreciated by the Chinese people. We firmly believe that once the opportunity arises, the United States' policy of opposing aggression in the Far East will take another step forward. Today, after thirty-two months of resistance, the ambassadors of the four nations that provide China with the greatest assistance are all gathered in Chongqing. This may seem like a coincidence, but it should not be viewed as purely accidental. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, Japanese militarists boasted that they would end the war within three to four months, but after thirty-two months of fighting, Japan is not only unable to conquer China but also lacks the strength to end the war. The Japanese insist on overthrowing the Chinese National Government, but they are unable to do so militarily or diplomatically. Therefore, the gathering of the four ambassadors in Chongqing today is no accident. Is there hope for justice to prevail? (Reuter's dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing - According to reliable sources, the press reports regarding the remarks made by French Ambassador Cosme when the China National Foreign Affairs Association hosted him on January 4th of this year, and the remarks made by the French Consul, who represented the French Ambassador at the opening of the second annual meeting of the Sino-French-Belgian-Swiss Cultural Association on February 25th of this year, both contain errors. Regarding the French Ambassador's remarks on January 4th, the press reported that the French Ambassador stated that China's position in this war between the two sides was the same as that of France. In reality, the French Ambassador only said that France, like China, has now experienced the horrors of war, and therefore hopes that 1940 will be a year of peace for both China and France, and hopes that China will soon realize the happiness and prosperity it deserves. Regarding the French Consul's remarks, the press reported that the Consul stated that China and France stood on an equal footing and that mutual cooperation was necessary for resisting aggression. The French Consul denied this, saying that he only expressed the wish that the cultural relations between China and France should be as close as possible within the realm of possibility.

<h3>Military Affairs Commission Announces Weekly War Situation from February 24th to March 1st</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission stated that since this week (February 24th to March 1st), the Chinese armies in various theaters have launched fierce attacks, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese army. Especially in southern Guangxi and the border region of Anhui and Jiangsu, large portions of the Japanese army have been dealt fatal blows by the Chinese army and have fallen into a state of disarray. The Chinese army is currently advancing smoothly. The important aspects of the combat operations are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Southern Guangxi: The remaining Japanese troops at Gaofeng'ao on the Yongwu Road are still being besieged and annihilated by the Chinese. On the morning of the 24th, more than 3,000 Japanese infantry and cavalry, along with multiple tanks, reinforced from Santang towards the north on the Yongbin Road. Because the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th Tangs have been firmly held by the Chinese, the Japanese dare not attempt to bypass them on either side. The Chinese army used predetermined annihilation tactics to encircle them. After three days and nights of piecemeal annihilation and concerted attacks, the Japanese army completely collapsed. On the night of the 26th, they retreated southward in two routes, leaving behind over 1,500 bodies and more than ten tanks, as well as multiple artillery pieces. On the 27th, they retreated to the vicinity of Santang, where the Chinese army pursued them vigorously, annihilating the remaining Japanese troops. On the Yongqin line, the Chinese army took advantage of the situation to recapture Lu Min, Xianbi, Nayuan, Lu Yishiling, Jiujiangzhen, Naping, and other strongholds, and also defeated the Japanese troops that were wreaking havoc near Shangsi, cutting off their retreat route. The Japanese army is extremely panicked.</p>
<p>Border Region of Anhui and Jiangsu: In order to eliminate the threat posed by the Chinese army to Nanjing, the Japanese army gathered troops and advanced towards Fanchang, Langxi, and Aoyang in multiple routes. After the Chinese army maneuvered and launched attacks, they lured the Japanese into their encirclement and dealt them a heavy blow. Fanchang and Langxi were successively recovered, and the Chinese army continued to capture Songlinkou, Majiaba, Dongwan, Ren Village, and other strongholds. The Japanese troops that invaded Liyang were mostly annihilated by the Chinese defenders when they advanced to the vicinity of Nanduzhen. A small number of surviving Japanese troops retreated. At the same time, a Chinese elite force launched a surprise attack on the Japanese rear communication lines, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway has been unable to operate for several days. In total, several thousand Japanese troops were killed in this campaign, completely thwarting their attempt to launch an offensive. The Japanese troops besieged in Nanjing are now under the absolute control of the Chinese army.</p>
<p>Shanxi Province: The Japanese troops have become a spent force. In the past week, the Japanese army has not dared to launch any offensive actions. The Chinese army has launched extensive maneuvering tactics, attacking important strongholds such as Baodian, Zhangdianzhen, Xia County, Fushan, Quwo, and Pan County, inflicting heavy casualties. The Chinese army even broke into Changzi city once, leaving the Japanese army at a loss and utterly terrified.</p>
<p>Northern Henan: The Chinese army is pressing towards Qinyang and once recovered Jiaozuo. The Japanese army is struggling to cope. The Chinese army in southern Henan has repeatedly inflicted casualties on the Japanese army at Chushandian and Youhe, and also broke into the south gate of Xinyang, inflicting heavy casualties. On the 24th, the Japanese army gathered reinforcements and launched an offensive towards the vicinity of Luoshan. After being encircled and severely attacked by the Chinese army, the Japanese army was completely annihilated by noon on the 26th, leaving behind over 760 bodies. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to advance and again approached the outskirts of Xinyang. The city has been in chaos for days, exposing its desperate and exhausted state.</p>
<p>Northern Hubei: Since the recovery of important strongholds such as Pingba, Luoyangdian, Yujiadian, and Dushan, the morale of the Japanese army has been in disarray. The Japanese army has been redeploying troops east and west, attempting to counterattack, but all attempts have been defeated. The Chinese armies in various routes advanced, thoroughly destroying the Japanese rear communication lines, and launched group attacks on the western suburbs of Maping, Youshan, and the southern suburbs of Suixian. The battle situation in northern Hubei is now completely under the control of the Chinese army.</p>
<p>Northern Hunan: The Chinese army has been extremely active in the Japanese rear, destroying the communication lines at Yanglousi, Zhongfang, and Taolin, and recovering various strongholds near Yueyang. The Japanese army has been rendered immobile.</p>
<p>Northern Jiangxi: The Chinese army recovered Gou Xingshan, pressed towards Xishan, besieged Wubucheng, and launched a fierce attack on Changshan, leaving the exhausted Japanese army unable to defend everywhere.</p>
<p>In addition, the Japanese troops besieged in Wuyuan, western Suiyuan, are still being severely attacked by the Chinese. The important stronghold of Bazibulong on the Wuzhai-Huawu Road has been captured, and the Chinese army continues to advance towards Baotou. In northern Chahar, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on Kangbao, killing countless Japanese officers and soldiers. On the northern bank of the Daqing River in Hebei, there have been days of bloody battles, with the Japanese suffering extremely heavy casualties. The Japanese troops in Beijing and Tianjin feel greatly threatened. In Guangdong Province, the Chinese army recovered Chenghai, broke into Xinhui and Guanyao, and besieged Zengcheng, causing the Japanese army to collapse on all fronts. The Chinese army in Jilin has been active in the snowy terrain for the past month, achieving repeated victories, killing over 3,000 Japanese troops and seizing thirty to forty artillery pieces, and thousands of rifles and machine guns in Changchun and Shixian, causing unrest in the Japanese rear base. In the areas of Zhide, Tongling, and Digang in southern Anhui, over twenty Japanese warships have been sunk or damaged by the Chinese army in the past week. Japanese transportation on the Yangtze River has become impossible. These battles should be specifically reported. (Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>

<h3>Hitler Receives Welles, Engages in Lengthy Conversation, Germany Presents No Peace Plan</h3>
<p>Berlin - At 11:15 this morning, Hitler received Welles, with the Italian Ambassador to Germany, Signor Attolico, accompanying Welles in his audience with the head of state. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and government officials Goschnar and Brockner were also in attendance during Hitler's reception of Welles. (Haitong Telegraph on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Berlin - An official announcement this morning stated that Head of State Hitler received Welles and the American Chargé d'Affaires to Germany, Kirk, this morning, engaging in a lengthy conversation. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was also present. When Welles arrived at and departed from the chancellery, honor guards presented arms. (Haitong Telegraph on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Berlin - U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles paid a courtesy visit yesterday to Weizsäcker, the Undersecretary of the German Foreign Office, and also held talks with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, lasting for one hour. Neither side has released the contents of the talks. Welles stated, "This conversation was quite interesting." The German side stated that, in accordance with President Roosevelt's wishes, the contents of the talks will not be released for the time being. It is known that Ribbentrop and Welles met and spoke in German, with Dr. Schmidt, a language expert from the Foreign Office, serving as the interpreter. Since the outbreak of the European war, Ribbentrop has only used German during this diplomatic meeting. Regarding President Roosevelt's letter, Welles declined to answer questions, only saying that the letter from Roosevelt to Mussolini "has given rise to various misconceptions." Political figures believe that if President Roosevelt also has a letter for Head of State Hitler, Welles will present it to Hitler in person at this afternoon's audience. Because Welles does not wish to hold ceremonies inappropriate for wartime, there will be no formal banquet. Ribbentrop will hold an informal banquet at his private residence in Dahlem to host Welles. U.S. Chargé d'Affaires to Germany, Kirk, will also host a banquet for Welles at his residence near Grunewald, inviting embassy staff to attend. Kirk is scheduled to hold a tea party at his residence today to give American expatriates the opportunity to meet Welles. General Göring may host Welles at a hunting lodge on the northern outskirts of Berlin, but this has not yet been confirmed. It is generally believed that Welles will leave Berlin on the morning of the 4th. (Haitong Telegraph on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Berlin - Responsible political figures here pointed out that U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles' arrival in Berlin yesterday coincided with the half-year anniversary of the German invasion of Poland. Welles is scheduled to leave Germany the day after tomorrow, his departure coinciding with the half-year anniversary of the declaration of war by England and France. The situation in the past six months is as follows: (1) Military Situation: German officials declare that Germany is currently only fighting on one front. The "blitzkrieg" against Poland did not result in any significant losses in manpower or material resources. On the contrary, Germany acquired a large amount of military spoils. The claim propagated by British and French newspapers that Germany lacks sufficient reserve forces has been proven inaccurate by the facts. The power of German weaponry has not only been demonstrated in the Polish war but also in the naval and air battles on the Western Front. The German Navy today not only controls the Baltic Sea but also a large part of the North Sea, and the superiority of the German Air Force is undeniable. The success of the German submarine warfare can be seen in the tonnage of enemy and neutral ships sunk. According to reliable reports, a total of 1.8 million tons of enemy and neutral ships have been sunk. (2) Political Situation: German officials point out that Germany's relations with the Soviet Union and Italy have been strengthened, and Romania's attitude is also reliable. Britain's policies in Southeastern and Northern Europe have failed because the Balkan and Scandinavian countries are unwilling to join the war. As for Turkey, although it has a mutual assistance pact with England and France, its reservations regarding Russia have greatly diminished the effectiveness of the pact. (3) Economic Situation: The impact of the Anglo-French blockade policy on Germany is not as severe as England and France had anticipated. Although Germany has lost some overseas trade, the large amount of food imported from Eastern Europe as a result of German-Russian cooperation has made up for it. Therefore, three important facts cannot be ignored: (1) Germany today has a population of 95 million; (2) The occupied territory of Poland has 14 million people who are under the rule of German Governor-General Frank and do not adopt a hostile attitude towards Germany; (3) German trade with Russia will reach 1.5 billion marks in value each year. In summary, the situation in the past six months has been very favorable to Germany and is believed that it will continue to be so. (Haitong Telegraph on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Berlin - Political observers here say that Hitler will likely propose Germany's "minimum conditions" for an armistice during his conversation with Welles. It is also rumored that after Welles reports the results of the meeting to Washington, Hitler may convene the Reichstag and deliver an important speech. In this speech, Hitler may reveal the content of his conversation with President Roosevelt's representative. It is also reported that German leaders seem to be doing their utmost to make Welles understand their sincerity in seeking peace, as they know that only by clearly presenting Germany's reasons for fighting this time can they restore diplomatic relations with the United States and possibly change America's attitude towards the current European war and future peace. (United Press on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Berlin - Someone hinted that Welles will meet with another important German figure, namely Hitler's party representative Hess, before leaving Germany. It is also heard that the meeting between Hitler and Welles lasted from 11:15 a.m. to 12:35 p.m. today. Welles returned to the embassy to rest after leaving. It is also learned that German Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Weizsäcker will host a banquet for Welles tonight, inviting External Intelligence Director Schmidt and Propaganda Department Intelligence Office Director Buchmer to attend. (United Press on the 2nd)</p>
<p>German Side Explains Its Stance</p>
<p>Berlin - According to U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles, who spoke to American reporters yesterday, his conversation with the German Foreign Minister was "extremely interesting." Welles also said, "The German government has treated me extremely well on this trip. I hope to visit Aviation Minister Göring as soon as possible and then go to Paris and London." Welles also sent a detailed report to Washington after his conversation with the German Foreign Minister. It is heard that Welles has obtained explanations on several issues. Although Welles' conversation with the German Foreign Minister was kept secret, the German Foreign Ministry has explained to Welles Germany's attitude towards war and peace. It is said that the two sides discussed the following points at the time: (1) Germany does not intend to end the war if it only restores the situation as it was in September of last year. Germany demands equality with Britain and a right to exist; (2) Germany believes that Britain has maintained its hegemonic position in the world for too long; (3) Germany believes that Germany should have the same influence in Europe as the United States has in the Americas; (4) Since England and France are attempting to maintain their advantage by force, Germany believes that there is no hope for peace. This peace must be based on the recognition that Germany has equal rights to enjoy raw materials and markets. (United Press on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Germany Spreads Peace Rumors Again</p>
<p>Berlin - According to the "German Political Report," political figures here claim that reports abroad of German peace plans are purely speculative. Germany has no intention of presenting a peace plan. Germany's diplomatic path is clear, reasonable, and without concealment. At the end of the Polish war, Head of State Hitler put forward a far-sighted and tolerant proposal to restore peace in Europe. At that time, Western European countries were still optimistic about the future of the war and rejected this proposal. Currently, Western European countries, due to the failure of the blockade policy and the refusal of neutral countries to participate in the war, are no longer as optimistic about the future of the war as before. The German government has no reason to make new proposals at this time. Head of State Hitler already raised the question of "War or Peace?" last October. Western European countries, violating the interests of their own people and the interests of all European countries, chose war. Germany has accepted the challenge. This situation has not changed. (Haitong Lightning on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Berlin - Regarding the British report that the German Minister to Ireland contacted the British Marquess of Tavistock and presented some tentative peace proposals to him, the German authorities have solemnly denied it, insisting that the rumor is completely fabricated. The "Hamburger Fremdenblatt" Berlin correspondent also stated that Head of State Hitler had already announced in a speech that Germany today has only one path, namely to continue the war by all means until victory is achieved. (Haitong Telegraph on the 2nd)</p>
<p>American Newspaper Criticizes German Viewpoint</p>
<p>New York - The New York Times today published a war article discussing Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's conversation with Welles. The article's key point was, "If Ribbentrop means that England seized the best things on earth during a time of peace and normalcy, to the detriment of other countries, then his words are absurd. In a time of peace, England's reserves are available for merchants of all countries to purchase, and the prices charged are the same as those paid by British merchants." The article also mentioned Germany's economic difficulties, saying, "Germans have shaken the confidence of foreign countries with endless threats of war, and have shaken the markets upon which their trade depends. Germans govern their own country, disregarding the standards of civilized behavior, and the feelings of foreign countries are turning against Germany, and Germany's markets are being lost." "Ribbentrop talks about England strangling the economic position of the world, but he should not forget that Hitler has strangled most of the world's goodwill." (Reuters dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<h3>Göring Returns to Berlin from the Front Lines</h3>
<p>Berlin - German Aviation Minister General Göring left the capital a week ago to inspect the North Sea area and front-line air force bases. He has now completed his official duties and returned here today. General Göring had a very good impression on this trip. He represented Head of State Hitler in awarding the Iron Cross to several officers and non-commissioned officers. While General Göring was at the front, he summoned the generals, listened to reports, and discussed transportation issues with railway officials. (Haitong Telegraph on the 2nd)</p>

<h3>German Planes Bomb British Convoy - British Ship "Perus" Sunk - German Plane Flies Over London</h3>
<p>London - According to Reuters, news has reached London that German planes have launched fierce attacks at sea. However, warships and escorted merchant ships sustained no damage. British fighter planes ascended to intercept, but did not make contact with the German planes. Fishermen arriving in Scarborough reported that two German planes approached them in the dim light this morning. Before the fishing boats could extinguish their lights, the planes opened fire with machine guns. This morning at 6:00 AM, loud cannon fire was heard in the Panwick area. Residents throughout the city were awakened from their sleep and looked towards the coast, believing a major naval battle was taking place. According to news from Dunbar, heavy cannon fire was heard throughout the night. Panwick officials claimed the cannon fire seemed to be exchanged between that location and the Firth of Forth for an hour. It is widely believed that ships were attacked. Air defense lookouts in the area reported seeing flashes of cannon fire at sea, but the darkness prevented them from determining the number of ships involved. This morning at 4:00 AM, explosions were also heard near the Northumberland coast, possibly from German planes attacking ships several miles offshore. British fighter planes were dispatched on patrol and returned around 9:00 AM. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Secrets of Magnetic Mines - Discovery Process</h3>
<p>London - The story of how British naval experts discovered the secrets of German magnetic mines is one of bravery and luck. British authorities suspected the existence of a new type of mine early in the war. However, the secret was only discovered on September 9th, when German planes dropped two of these mines on a beach near Xu Bailinais. They were revealed when the tide receded. The British first photographed the mines and then brave experts set about removing the attached parachutes. The next day, the dangerous task of dismantling the mines began. First, Navy Major Olifritz explained his proposed method to those participating in the operation, so that if any danger arose, the others could begin studying the construction of another mine. After Olifritz finished speaking, he took one of the mines to a wide field and began working alone. He successfully removed the magnetic detonator, thinking it was safe. The others then gathered around and proceeded to dismantle the other parts together. Unexpectedly, another detonator was discovered inside the mine. After careful and skillful work, they managed to remove it safely as well. Dismantling the remaining parts was no problem for the experts. Thus, this new invention that threatened shipping was exposed by British authorities. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3>French Government Announces Orders - Implementing Purchase Restrictions - Prices to Return to Pre-War Levels - Some Occupations to Be Filled by Women</h3>
<p>Paris - The government gazette published 17 miscellaneous decrees today, implementing purchase restrictions and other economic measures. The important ones are listed below: (1) All residents of France must obtain a registered purchase permit from the authorities, starting on April 1st of this year, in order to purchase various restricted goods based on the permit. (2) The baking of all types of fancy breads is prohibited, except for biscuits and similar breads. (3) Candy and pastry shops throughout the country should be closed for three days every week on Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday, but may operate as usual if they coincide with legal holidays. (4) Each restaurant meal must provide only two courses, with meat only accounting for one. Cold dishes and soups may still be provided as usual, but butter may not be provided separately. (5) The amount of gasoline that anyone can purchase each month should be limited to what is sufficient for one car. (6) The drinking and sale of all types of spirits and aperitifs are prohibited on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Since July 1st of last year, the retail quantity of these alcoholic beverages must be more than two liters per purchase, in order to restrict the purchase by the lower classes. (7) Farmers throughout the country may purchase seeds for this year at the legally prescribed price. (8) In all areas where residents have been ordered to evacuate, a portion of their land should be cultivated by the army on their behalf. (9) All price increases since September 1st of last year should be restored to their original state. (10) Certain occupations should be filled by women, in order to free up men for national defense work. (11) Audit committees should be established in all agencies to review the expenditures of those agencies. (12) Committees should be established in all departments to assess the prices of goods purchased by those departments. (13) Frugality committees should be established in all military agencies. (14) All foreign expenditures of departments must be determined in advance and submitted to the Cabinet for approval. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Paris - Commerce Minister Shang Dan recently stated that the Cabinet has passed legal decrees hoping to reconcile the two needs of controlling imports and increasing exports as much as possible. From now on, foreign goods that are transshipped through France to other countries or are made into other products in France after being imported and then exported again, only require the importing merchant to submit an application to the authorities stating that the goods will not remain in France and that France will be able to exchange them for foreign currency. The goods will then be allowed to enter without having to go through complicated examination procedures, and there will be no restrictions on their quantity and value. However, the application must be reviewed by a committee composed of representatives from the relevant departments. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<h3>Neutral Vessels - Inspection Issues - Britain and Germany Accuse Each Other</h3>
<p>London - The German Embassy in the Netherlands recently issued a document to Dutch newspapers, stating that any neutral country that requests a certificate from British authorities to facilitate maritime inspections is, in effect, acknowledging the blockade measures taken by Britain, and Germany will retaliate. The British Ministry of Economic Warfare issued a bulletin in response, stating that this German document is yet another threat to neutral countries. Well-informed sources also said that the German statement "completely distorts the facts." The purpose of the certificate method is only to facilitate the inspection of goods shipped from countries such as Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay to Europe. Its nature is voluntary and is not due to agreements between Britain, France, and the Americas or neutral European countries. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Berlin - The German official news agency, when announcing the principles of the Hamburg Prize Court's litigation procedure, stated that if a ship sails into an enemy port, the so-called "enemy destination" is proven. This measure also applies to goods intended for neutral ports. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Bank of France - Transfers Large Gold Reserves to the Government - Ministry of Finance Signs Agreement with the Bank</h3>
<p>Paris - The agreement signed between the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of France has been published in the government gazette. The main points are: (1) The Bank of France transfers 30 billion francs in gold reserves to the government, and the government will provide Treasury bonds of equal value. (2) After the Bank of France's gold reserves are revalued, the 20 billion francs that the Ministry of Finance borrowed from the Bank of France before the war should be repaid immediately, and the Bank of France will then lend the government an amount still limited to 20 billion francs. Of the above two points, the former is the most important. The government already has a large foreign exchange stabilization fund, and now it will add this 30 billion francs in gold, so its war funds will be extremely abundant. (Havas, 1st)</p>

<h3>Soviet Troops Approaching Suburbs of Vyborg - Finnish Troops Implement Scorched-Earth Tactics - Steady Stream of Fresh Soviet Troops Reinforcing, Attempting Three-Sided Encirclement - Both Sides Engage in Hand-to-Hand Combat, Paying a Heavy Price for Every Inch Gained</h3>
<p>Moscow - The Soviet Union issued an official gazette this morning stating that Soviet troops have entered Vyborg, which is engulfed in flames due to the scorched-earth tactics implemented by the Finnish troops before their retreat. (Haitong, 2nd)</p>
<p>Helsinki - Soviet troops are attempting to encircle Vyborg from three points. A large number of fresh troops and mechanized units have joined the battle. On the main front line of the Karelian Isthmus, Soviet troops have advanced, forcing the Finnish troops to retreat. Every inch of land is given up only after hand-to-hand combat until exhaustion. Therefore, the Soviet losses are also very heavy. The Finnish troops are currently making superhuman efforts to hold the line, awaiting the arrival of spring, when weather conditions will make it more difficult for the Soviet troops to advance. It is now acknowledged here that Vyborg may fall, and attention is focused on the isthmus. According to news from other front lines, only artillery activity is reported. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Moscow - According to news from here today, the three main roads leading to Vyborg were in the hands of Soviet troops yesterday. It is possible that Vyborg will be encircled from three sides today. The Finns are currently setting fire to Vyborg. Foreign military experts observe that after the fall of Vyborg, the Red Army will likely split into two routes. One route will turn north to outflank the Mannerheim Line, and the other route will continue to advance along the coast, aiming to directly attack Helsinki. (United Press, 2nd)</p>
<p>Helsinki - Officials here acknowledged today that Finnish troops have retreated from their forward positions yesterday due to Soviet pressure. However, they said that this retreat has no significant impact on the Finnish defense, and that the Soviet victory, whether in terms of manpower or material resources, is not worth the cost. Furthermore, according to news from northern Finland, the Finnish troops in the Jemo area have retreated south from Naozi and have now reached a new line of defense that was built earlier. They are currently strengthening their positions. It is reported that Soviet troops have also followed and advanced. (United Press, 2nd)</p>
<p>Moscow - According to a communiqué from the Leningrad Military District Headquarters, the offensive of the United Forces in the Karelian region continued to develop yesterday, occupying the Pskelenksky Falls area of the Visi River, and the Shuli Railway Station (southern suburbs of Vyborg) on the Vyborg-Satu Paul Railway, the town of Yuchyoki, the town of Meinikala, and Cape Kejansnimi on the west coast of Vyborg Bay. The enemy has set fire to Vyborg. From February 11th to March 1st, Soviet troops captured a total of 922 enemy fortresses, including 235 gun emplacements. The enemy also lost 506 cannons, 2,732 machine guns, 19 tanks, 22,000 artillery shells, 10,000 rifles, and 14 million bullets. There were no developments in other areas. The Soviet Air Force bombed enemy troops and military targets yesterday. It also shot down 11 enemy planes in aerial combat. From February 11th to March 1st, the Soviet Air Force shot down a total of 191 enemy planes. The Soviets also lost 21 planes. (TASS, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Germany and Sweden Plan to Mediate - Soviet-Finnish War - Soviet Conditions for Peace as Reported in London</h3>
<p>London - The "Daily Express" recently published a dispatch from its correspondent in The Hague stating that after the fall of the port of Vyborg, Stalin is reportedly preparing to negotiate a peace treaty with Finland and has already drafted conditions, which are shown in the attached photographs. The main points are five: (1) The border between Finland and the Soviet Union in the Karelian Isthmus should be re-delimited so that all the main fortresses of the Finnish Mannerheim Line that were occupied by the Red Army last month should belong to the Soviet Union. (2) The coastal batteries of Kovistu and all land batteries between the port of Vyborg and the old border should be handed over to the Soviet Union. (3) The three islands of Hogland, Lavansaari, and Seiskari (all located in the Gulf of Finland) should be ceded to the Soviet Union. (4) The port of Petsamo in northern Finland should be controlled by the Soviet Union for at least ten years. The border between Finland and the Soviet Union in the north should be the city of Neuvottukki. (5) The current Finnish government should be reorganized so that Stalin can show the Soviet people that he is not negotiating a peace treaty with the Finnish plutocratic government. The noteworthy aspect of these points is that the Soviet Union does not intend to demand Hanko Island (located in the Gulf of Finland), the Gibraltar of Finland, nor does it intend to establish a government led by Kuusinen. German and Swedish diplomats are reportedly actively working in Moscow to achieve a successful mediation. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Japan's Policy of Controlling Wartime Prices - Complete Failure - Shortage of Goods, Currency Inflation - Difficult Living, People Complain Bitterly</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The Japanese government, in order to control the current situation, plans to form a price conference consisting of 15 people, chaired by the Prime Minister and assisted by the four ministers of agriculture, finance, commerce, and health, as well as eight or nine important leaders from the financial and industrial sectors. They will consider the extent to which various goods are affected by increased taxes and higher production costs and will formulate new price standards. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Japanese government, recognizing the importance of the price issue, is now urgently seeking to implement a price countermeasures deliberation council and has decided to discuss and decide on it at an extraordinary cabinet meeting tomorrow. In addition to the Prime Minister, Minister of Finance, Minister of Agriculture, Minister of Commerce, and Minister of Health, the government members of the deliberation council will also include the Minister of Communications. After the cabinet decision, the procedures for consultation with the Privy Council will be carried out next week, and it will be announced and implemented. (Domei News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The "Yomiuri Shimbun" today published an article severely criticizing the Japanese government's wartime price policy, stating that the government's attempts to lower prices are a "descent into failure." The newspaper criticized the government's theory as "fundamentally contrary to economic facts" and stated that the price reduction policy "has now become an obstacle to the daily economic life of the people." The "Yomiuri Shimbun" mentioned that the government recently decided to reorganize the Central Price Policy Committee and merge it into a government advisory body under the supervision of the Minister of Commerce and Industry. The newspaper also criticized the Minister of Commerce and Industry's statement that the government wants to set "reasonable" prices to correct the rise of certain prices. The newspaper warned that there are two reasons for the rising price trend: one is the expansion of the currency system, and the other is the lack of material resources. "If the government attempts to prevent the expansion of the currency system, the huge financial procedures will be hindered. If the government attempts to improve the lack of material resources, the material mobilization procedures must be redrawn. We urgently need great politicians to deal with this situation." (United Press, 2nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo - According to observers here, the cost of living continues to rise as evidenced by the indices. In Tokyo, fuel and lighting costs rose 17 percent in February compared to January, food rose 7.1 percent, clothing rose 1.6 percent, utensils rose 5.1 percent, and general prices rose an average of 6.3 percent. When averaging 137 types of prices, 100 rose, 8 fell, and 29 remained unchanged. According to the "Nichi Nichi Shimbun," Tokyo coal merchants have decided to pre-purchase coal for the next winter and ship it in the summer, but the police department disapproves and is now trying to cancel these orders. Those responsible for fuel supply will soon go to the coal-producing areas to inspect the accounts of the coal mining companies and order them to cancel forward delivery orders. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Anti-War Movement in Japan - High Tide - The More Pressure, the Stronger the Reaction</h3>
<p>Hong Kong - According to external news from Tokyo, the anti-war movement in Japan is becoming increasingly turbulent. Alarmed, the Japanese government is attempting to suppress it. For days, it has dispatched a large number of police to conduct investigations in the two locations of Shimoryo and Kyoto Prefecture, arresting 55 intellectuals who are the most active in the anti-war movement. After repeated trials by the Kyoto District Court, all admitted without hesitation and condemned the militarists for misleading the country and harming the people. In order to suppress the anti-war movement in various places and prevent it from becoming more intense, the Japanese government decided on the 29th to sentence Deguchi Onisaburo, aged 70, to life imprisonment, Takagi Tetsuo, aged 67, to 12 years' imprisonment, Deguchi Sumiko, aged 58, to 15 years' imprisonment, Higashio Yoshisaburo, aged 53, to 12 years' imprisonment, Deguchi Baisaburo, chairman of the Omotokyo headquarters, to five years' imprisonment, and Deguchi Isao to 15 years' imprisonment. However, anti-war incidents are still erupting everywhere, and the trend is about to spread like wildfire. (1st dispatch)</p>
<h3>Saito Takao - Disciplinary Issue - Hardliners and Softliners Clash</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Regarding the issue of punishing Saito Takao for his inappropriate remarks, he has decided to resign from his position as a member of parliament voluntarily. However, at the time of his resignation, in order to explain his misunderstanding, he wanted to make a clarifying speech at the general assembly. Therefore, he applied to the Disciplinary Committee Chairman Nakai to cancel the decision to postpone the adoption of the punishment committee on the 2nd. The Minseito Party and the Kuhara faction of the Seiyukai Party largely approved of this. However, the Nakajima faction of the Seiyukai Party, the Situation Comrades Association, the Social Democratic Party, and other small factions all advocated expulsion. In the event of voluntary resignation, they would not especially give him an explanation and insisted that he read it out in the parliament. Since the 1st, various factions have made various compromises, but opinions are still divided and have not reached a consensus. The Disciplinary Committee of the 2nd met in the budget committee room in the afternoon, which was unprecedentedly tense. It adjourned at 3:00 PM. The hardliners such as the Kuhara faction of the Seiyukai Party and the Situation Comrades Association advocated careful consideration of Saito's application to Chairman Nakai to postpone the adoption, and did not directly meet with the chairman or convey it in writing, but only communicated it by telephone. The committee was able to approve of this and also advocated that the Minseito Party should clearly state whether it should be responsible for Saito's problem. Therefore, each faction is negotiating on how to deal with this. (Domei News Agency, date illegible)</p>
<h3>British Finance Minister Warns the Nation - Do Not Hold Optimistic Illusions - Germany's Strength Should Not Be Ignored - The Spirit of Resistance Cannot Be Relaxed for a Single Day</h3>
<p>London - Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir Simon made a radio address tonight, warning the nation not to mistakenly think that we can now rest easy, that the full force of the war has not yet touched our lives, and that victory can ultimately be obtained cheaply, as this is a dangerous illusion. Simon continued, "We are confronted by a very strong and numerous nation, subjected to the most severe discipline and united by the most rigorous means. Even if the people want to resist, they dare not do so. If anyone asks me to distinguish between the leaders and the people of Germany, I answer that I am willing to do so when the German people show that they are different. I cannot absolve ordinary German citizens of responsibility for Germany's aggression. I now urge you not to heed or believe the various rumors of internal discord or division within Germany. The only wise policy we should adopt is to resolutely prepare to meet the united strength of Hitlerism. As long as this ideology is not eliminated, our efforts should not be relaxed for a single day, and the only possible way to end the war is the elimination of this ideology." Simon then mentioned the quiet period of the first six months of the war, saying that the Allies had been able to use this time. Unlike the enemy, the Allies are not good at being prepared for war. Although Britain and France have made great efforts to carry out the necessary work of rearmament in the past three or four years, there are still many gaps to be filled. Once the war breaks out, any serious shortcomings should be remedied. We have been able to greatly improve our armaments and all our equipment in the past six months. No matter what Germany has improved in these six months, the Allies have gained an advantage in comparison. In these six months, the major overseas dominions have issued credibility certificates, indicating that they are indeed our compatriots. We and the French have also been able to enhance our good understanding, and the legitimacy of Britain and France in all aspects has never been as close as it is today. Today, the two countries have unified command, unified policy, unified finances, and unified supply. This cooperation will continue after the war. The six months of silence has given neutral opinion in the world the opportunity to express its sympathy for the cause of the Allies. If the Soviet Union were not indeed Germany's friend, Germany would have no friends. The barbaric methods used by the Nazis to treat the Polish people, and the tyrannical methods they have taken to sink neutral ships and machine-gun fishing boats and lightships, have undoubtedly shown where the sympathy of recent onlookers lies. Although there are still several neutral countries that fear Germany, I ask, is there any neutral country that hopes Germany will win? (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3>British Blockade: German Coal Exports to Italy Treated as Contraband</h3>
<p>The Hague: The British government has decided to consider German coal exports to Italy as contraband. News of this decision has greatly shocked the shipowners of various Italian vessels anchored in Rotterdam, Netherlands. However, they stated that until they receive formal instructions from the Italian government, they will continue loading German coal and await further orders. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Rome: The Italian newspaper "Giornale d'Italia" commented on the British blockade of German coal exports, stating that the Italian government's timely plans have minimized the impact of the British decision, as one-third of Italy's coal supply comes from overland routes from Germany. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Rome: Italian Ambassador to the UK, Bastianini, returned to Italy for consultations several days ago and swiftly returned to London last night. According to observers here, the economic negotiations between Britain and Italy were interrupted due to Italy's continued purchase of German coal. Ambassador Bastianini's return to his post may allow both sides to reopen negotiations as soon as possible. (Havas, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Bishop Walsh's Impressions of Traveling in Chongqing: China Is Indeed Capable of Prolonged Struggle; The Patriotic Sentiment of the People Is Exceptionally Strong; Foreigners Cannot Rule by Force</h3>
<p>The "Continental Daily" reports that Bishop Walsh, who has lived in China for 30 years, recently traveled to Chongqing and western China, and is now returning to Shanghai. He is scheduled to depart for the United States on the President Pierce on the 28th. Yesterday (the 27th), according to Bishop Walsh, Chongqing is not only China's wartime capital but also a region of great strength in Asia, a starting point for spiritual, social, and economic rebirth. More than twenty years ago, I (Bishop Walsh referring to himself) first traveled to Sichuan Province, and I have returned to the area at the time when this crucial war in China is about to break out.</p>
<p>Knowledgeable Young Women Serving the Country</p>
<p>After the war began, I stayed in the area for over a year. After being away for many months, I recently had the opportunity to see western China again and have clearly seen the new spirit growing among the people. When I first traveled to Sichuan, I saw soldiers training in nearby small villages; I still see them now, and there are even more of them. Everywhere, there are young people called "Little Teachers" promoting education. The injured are given medical care. Factories, universities, and hospitals are being established one after another. In one of the military camps, I was introduced to a Chinese woman responsible for delousing. She did not mind the dirt and worked, causing her face and clothes to be covered in dust. I spoke with her in my broken Chinese, and soon learned that this woman was one of the best teachers at the Peking Union Medical College. She had abandoned her well-paid job and was working among the soldiers, earning only twenty yuan a month. I constantly encountered similar incidents along the way, which proves that intellectuals in western China are working as "yeast in a dough."</p>
<p>The Will of the People is Exceptionally Strong</p>
<p>The losses and suffering caused by the bombing of Chongqing are truly terrible, but at the same time, it is also an opportunity for improvement. The bombed-out areas are not being hastily rebuilt with houses but are beginning to build good roads to modernize the city. The crowded conditions in the old areas have now been improved, and businesses and residences have been dispersed. Schools and residential areas are being built in the suburbs, and factories and retail stores are located ten to twenty miles outside the old city. Chongqing, like New York, is built on hillsides, and hundreds of tunnels have been dug into the rocks to avoid future bombings. The situation in China's great western capital clearly shows that China can continue its struggle indefinitely. I say this not to judge the rights and wrongs of the war in China. People around the world are fundamentally the same. For example, the Japanese also hope for peace in the Pacific, just as we Americans do. But others should now understand that in this era of human history, foreigners cannot rule the Chinese people by force. When the minds and spirits of the Chinese people are as stimulated as they are today, it is absolutely impossible for foreign military forces to establish a stable Chinese government based on the support of a small number of Chinese. This can be seen from the past twenty-five years of Chinese history, let alone more distant history. The spirit, observation, and creativity that the Chinese people are now displaying are sufficient to prove this point.</p>
<p>There are Currently Seven Million Soldiers</p>
<p>What I have seen is now clearer than before. If China is going to have a war lasting thirty or forty years, then the Chinese people are stepping up preparations to meet it. There are now more than seven million armed people in China, and this number is constantly increasing. However, China's preparation is not focused on weapons and ammunition but on the vast land, the lower economic level of the people, the unwavering determination of the soldiers, the increasing number of leaders with modern education, and the widespread concern of the people in this crucial struggle. I call this the patriotism of the people.</p>
<h3>Chinese Army in Dinghai Achieves Victory</h3>
<p>People Offer Flags to Show Respect</p>
<p>Dinghai Communication: The Chinese army in Dinghai launched a counter-offensive on the 11th and achieved victory. The people expressed their joy. On the 19th, representatives of women's groups in the city area crossed the Japanese army's defense line and presented four silk banners and woolen clothes to a certain unit of the Chinese army. A grand presentation ceremony was held in a certain temple at 9:00 AM on the 20th, and the determination of the people's will was reported.</p>

<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that inheritance tax is an important component of the direct tax system.

The date and area of implementation will be determined by order. All persons who leave property within the territory of the Republic of China at the time of their death must pay inheritance tax. Citizens of the Republic of China who have a domicile within the territory of the country and who have property abroad must also pay tax. The details are recorded as follows:</p>

<p>Evaluation of Mining and Fishing Rights Multiplied</p>
<p>The value of mining rights and fishing rights shall be evaluated based on the number of remaining years, multiplied by the following multiples: (1) If the remaining years are one year, the value shall be the amount of its extra profit; (2) If the remaining years are three years or less, the value shall be twice the amount of its extra profit; (3) If the remaining years are five years or less, the value shall be three times the amount of its extra profit; (4) If the remaining years are seven years or less, the value shall be four times the amount of its extra profit; (5) If the remaining years are twelve years or less, the value shall be six times the amount of its extra profit; (6) If the remaining years are sixteen years or less, the value shall be seven times the amount of its extra profit; (7) If the remaining years are more than sixteen years, the value shall be eight times the amount of its extra profit.</p>
<p>Assessment of Ground Rights</p>

If the establishment of ground rights does not have a fixed term limit, the value shall be seven times the amount of one year's rent. However, if there are local customs, the remaining term limit may be determined according to the customs.</p>
<p>Assessment Standards for Sole Proprietorships</p>
<p>When a business is operated by a sole proprietor, the value of the business rights at the time of the proprietor's death shall be estimated according to the following standards: (1) Scope of business; (2) Amount of assets; (3) Number of years of past operation; (4) Profit and loss situation in recent years; (5) Goodwill. The assessment of immovable properties such as land and buildings shall be based on the market price at the time of the inheritance. If it is not possible to assess it based on the market price, the value shall be calculated by restoring its rent at an annual interest rate of 12%. The value of a pawnshop right shall be its pawnshop right value. The amount of life insurance money agreed to be paid to the designated beneficiary or his heirs at the time of the insured's death shall be exempt from inheritance tax. The calculation of the value of perpetual tenancy rights shall be based on five times the annual rental price.</p>

<h3>History of High-Handedness: Lido Barely Avoids Mishap; Lido Wins Right to Final; Eliminates East Celes 2-1; Penalty Kick in Extra Time</h3>
<p>In the semi-final replay of the History of High-Handedness Cup between Lido and Portugal to determine the championship, Lido defeated East Celes 2-1 in extra time, and Portugal eliminated West Phos 2-1. Lido's battle against East Celes in the Yiyuan was a victory against the odds in extremely difficult circumstances. Five thousand fans were overjoyed. The spring was cold and threatening rain. In the first half, East Celes took the lead with 1-0 at 25 minutes. Xu Wen-Kui missed a penalty kick at 12 yards. It was not until half of the second half had passed that Xu Wen-Kui leveled the score. At the end of regulation time, each side had one goal, resulting in a tie. In extra time, Li Yi-Chen scored a penalty kick at 12 yards, and Lido escaped danger by eliminating East Celes, which took a lot of effort.</p>
<p>Lido: Lu Zhong-En, Li Yi-Chen, Zhang Lin-Gen, Yan Shi-Xin, Meng Yi-Liang, Jiang Zhao-Xiang, Cao Qiu-Ting, Sun Jin-Shun, Huang Ke-Hou, Xu Wen-Kui, Zhang Ming-Sheng</p>
<p>East Celes: Ma Li-Si, Hai Lie-Xun, A Nuo-Te, Huo Hou, Jie Lai, Pan Jie-Tuo, Dan Ni-Si, Luo Bo-Zhi, Jin Sai-Lai, Mai Ke-La-De, Pai Er</p>
<p>British Troops Rampage to Take the Lead</p>
<p>Lido kicked off, but unfortunately, the headwind became a tailwind. Wen-Kui received Jin-Shun's pass to Ming-Sheng. Ming-Sheng flicked the ball in, but Hai Lie-Xun blocked it into a corner kick. Ke-Hou headed the ball, but Ma Li-Si parried it into another corner kick. Qiu-Ting took the corner kick, but it was not effective. The British troops attacked with the tailwind, and their momentum was fierce. At this time, the Lido camp was overrun by the enemy cavalry. Fortunately, they were able to defend effectively and suffered no losses. The British troops' arrogance did not diminish slightly. At 21 minutes, Yi-Liang took a goal kick, but it bounced back off Yi-Chen's body. Yi-Chen held the ball and dribbled around, but Pai Er came to snatch it and eventually stole it. Pai Er picked the ball up, and Jin-Zhai-Lai hit it hard, causing Lido to lose a goal. Lido counterattacked, single-handedly entering the goal area, but Wen-Kui was a step late and was saved by Mao Li-Si. Before long, Jin Sai-Lai and Pai Er were injured one after another, and each rested for a moment before returning to the game. The first half ended with the British troops leading by one to zero.</p>
<p>A Hair's Breadth Away From Tying the Score</p>
<p>As the second half began, Lido vowed to take revenge and attacked very eagerly. Three or four opportunities were missed. Ming-Sheng picked the ball up and headed it to Ke-Hou, but he did not get it. Jin-Shun shot in the penalty area and was blocked. Wen-Kui hit the goal, but it bounced back off Hai Lie-Xun's chest. At 20 minutes, Qiu-Ting passed the ball to Jin-Shun, and Hai Lie-Xun accidentally committed a handball. Wen-Kui took the penalty, shooting straight at the goal, but Ma Li-Si parried it. The audience sighed, and Wen-Kui also stomped his feet. Wen-Kui's anger rose from his heart, and he fiercely hooked the shot. The ball shaved over Ma Li-Si's head and flew into the empty goal. Everyone thought it was sure to score, but who knew that Hai Lie-Xun was quick-witted and quick-footed, and rushed back to save it into a corner kick. A ball of hope instantly vanished. At 27 minutes, Wen-Kui lived up to expectations and received a pass from Jin-Shun at the 15-yard mark, sweeping it into the net and redeeming his missed penalty kick. Until the end of regulation time, both sides were tied at one goal each.</p>
<p>Solve the Victory or Defeat in Extra Time</p>
<p>Since a draw was achieved, extra time was played for another 30 minutes. The Lido players were very inspired, and the military prestige was greatly boosted. They besieged the enemy's goal, firing shots like a string of pearls, but they were all saved by Ma Li-Si. Lido fought too bravely, and both Yi-Liang and Lin-Gen were injured. Lin-Gen withdrew to rest due to his poor performance, but since the outcome depended on this move, how could he stand by and watch? Before long, he rejoined the battle. At 12 minutes, Ming-Sheng picked the ball up, and Jin-Shun hit the goal. Jie-Lai, in a moment of desperation, accidentally committed a handball and was penalized again. Yi-Chen stepped forward, and the ball flew out like an arrow, straight into the corner of the net. Lido emerged victorious, and the overall situation was determined. The first 15 minutes ended, and the match continued on the other side of the field. The British troops burned their boats and launched a desperate counterattack, but to no avail. Lido finally eliminated East Celes by a score of 2-1.</p>

<h3>Finance: Speculators Settle US Dollar Positions; Rumors of European Peace Abound, Possibly Lengthening US Dollar Positions in Local Market</h3>
<p>In yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's listed prices showed no change. The unofficial British-American exchange market was quiet for half the day. However, some prudent speculators slightly released their US dollar holdings, because rumors of European peace were spreading in the market. If this materializes, the overseas US-British exchange rate may return to the four-dollar mark. In other words, the local US dollar exchange rate will also follow suit and lengthen. Moreover, HSBC continued to supply dollars today, and there were rumors that it was maintaining the rate on behalf of the Currency Stabilization Fund Committee. However, most foreign banks were happy to absorb dollars at a cheaper rate, so the spot US dollar only saw a slight increase of 0.03125. The British pound remained stagnant at the original price of 1/2d, with no change. The morning opening average was still 1/2d and 6.71875 yuan. Initially, although foreign firms were buying, HSBC was reluctant to sell, so there was no impact. Later, a small number of Chinese merchants sold off their positions for this month's settlement, so around 10 a.m., the US dollar slightly lengthened, reaching 6.75 yuan. Afterwards, although money exchange houses and some Chinese banks also followed suit and released their holdings, foreign banks such as Banque Belge and some others were quite willing to absorb them, so the position remained balanced, allowing it to stabilize. The situation remained quiet at noon. By closing, the British pound was still at 1/2d, and the US dollar was at 6.75 yuan. The potential for futures was no different from the spot market.</p>
<p>HSBC Still Supplies</p>
<p>Early in the morning, the London cable showed the near-term down 0.03125, and the far-term down 0.01875. New York silver prices remained stable, and London gold remained unchanged. Exchange rates for British pounds against US dollars, Shanghai yuan, and French francs were all stable. The US dollar against the British pound lengthened by 0.0125, against Shanghai yuan unchanged, and against French francs up 0.025. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling price for British pounds was 1/2d, and the US dollar was 6.71875 yuan, with no change compared to the previous close. After opening, although the foreign firm sector came to buy spot sterling, HSBC was still willing to supply it, and at that time, MacKay &amp; Co. also had selling intentions, so there was no impact. HSBC's listed prices were unchanged. The silver balance tax was down by a small margin of 0.015. Afterwards, speculators suddenly began to release their US dollar holdings for this month's settlement, but the amounts were all sporadic, so the loosening trend was minimal. It is estimated that the price sold to Banque Belge and some other banks was 6.6875 yuan. Then, a certain bank resold spot US dollars to foreign firms at 6.75 yuan. At the same time, Banque Sino-Italienne also sold spot US dollars to counterparts at 6.75 yuan. After 10:30 a.m., Chinese merchants made more profits and came to release some more holdings, and Chinese banks and overseas Chinese also settled their US dollar positions for April. However, foreign banks such as Banque Belge and some others were still absorbing well, so it was able to remain unchanged. It is estimated that speculators again released their US dollar holdings for this month to a certain bank at 6.6875 yuan, and money exchange houses sold US dollars to Banque Belge at 6.8125 yuan. Including overseas Chinese selling US dollars for April to foreign firms at 6.53125 yuan, the situation was quieter at noon.

<h3>Certain Atmosphere Intensifies Again; Gold Market Decline Expands</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold market situation expanded decline, almost breaking through the 4,800 yuan mark. This was due to HSBC's continuous sales, rumors of the Currency Stabilization Fund Committee's support, today's US dollar's strengthening, and certain negative domestic news, causing market sentiment to become anxious. The end of the week also contributed to the increasing number of retail investors selling, while large buyers from the Hong Kong syndicate were not buying. Although a certain securities firm was buying, its strength was insufficient and did not help. In the first half of the day, the situation was weak from the start. Although the foreign exchange market reported flat, it fell 7 yuan immediately after opening, to 4,842 yuan, which was the highest point of the day. Later, due to the strengthening of the US dollar in the foreign exchange market, sellers became more crowded. A certain gold firm and a certain bank competed to sell, retreating to 4,822 yuan. Later, a certain securities firm suddenly absorbed a large amount on behalf of the local syndicate, and gold firms also started buying, so it temporarily stabilized, recovering to 4,836 yuan. However, at that time, a certain atmosphere suddenly arose in the market, and another securities firm vigorously sold on behalf of a customer syndicate, coupled with cash gold firms and a certain bank selling again, the market situation became difficult again. By the time of the noon close, a low of 4,800 yuan appeared, but the noon close was 4,802 yuan. As a result, it fell sharply by 47 yuan compared to the previous day. In the afternoon, the off-market slightly rebounded. It is said that the final price was around 4,810 yuan. The trading volume for half a day was over 1,000 taels. Jewelry gold was listed down.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Plunged 47 Yuan, Sea Customs Gold Remained Stable</p>
<p>From the morning opening, although the foreign exchange rate was flat, the situation was slightly weak. A certain gold firm was the first to sell, coupled with very few buyers, so the opening price was immediately lowered by 7 yuan, selling 20 taels to a securities firm at 4,812 yuan. Shortly after, a certain bank also came to vigorously sell, and jewelry firms also sold, and the US dollar in the foreign exchange market strengthened, falling 20 yuan. Jewelry firms sold 40 taels to gold firms at 4,822 yuan. Later, due to the sudden rise in buying sentiment from the securities firm, coupled with the fact that a certain gold firm was also buying on behalf of customers at that time, and a certain bank also slightly re-entered, it recovered 14 yuan. Cash gold firms sold 30 taels to securities firms at 4,836 yuan. Then, a certain securities firm suddenly came to sell, and cash gold firms also had strong selling intentions. A certain bank and retail investors sold again. Although money exchange houses and another securities firm still had some buying appetite on dips, it was ultimately difficult to maintain. By the time of the noon close, it had fallen another 36 yuan, with securities firms selling 40 taels to money exchange houses, down to 4,800 yuan. Later, jewelry firms bought 50 taels from money exchange houses, slightly recovering 2 yuan, to 4,802 yuan, as the noon closing price. As a result, it fell sharply by 47 yuan compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 42 yuan in half a day. The cash gold firm's listed selling price of its own brand gold was several yuan higher than spot gold, and the buying price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current bid gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Listed Down Five Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael in jewelry stores was initially still 490 yuan in major stores. By 11:30 a.m., it was listed down 5 yuan, and there were no changes after that. As a result, major stores changed their listings to 485 yuan. New stores had the same price as above, and the buying price was reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Australian Dollar Sees Sharp Rise; 8.9 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign currencies, including British pounds and US dollars, saw strong selling pressure, and the market was weak. Large British and US dollar bills were selling, and prices were loosening. In the evening market, British dollar bills fell to 55/2 yuan, and US dollar bills fell to 14.68 yuan. Demand for Hong Kong bills was stagnant, and Singapore and Dutch bills were weak. Philippine bills followed suit and fell. Australian dollar bills were rare, but demand suddenly increased, and prices rose sharply. Japanese dollar bills were slightly firm, and the evening market was 1.0302 yuan. Korean bills remained at 1.015 yuan. Yesterday's market prices saw British pounds and US dollars each fall by 0.5 yuan, British dollar bills fell by 0.1 yuan, US dollar bills fell by 0.06 yuan, Hong Kong bills fell by 0.01 yuan, Singapore and Dutch bills each fell by 0.1 yuan, Philippine bills fell by 0.05 yuan, and Australian dollar bills rose by 8.7 yuan.

<h3>Grains: Rice Merchants Cause Trouble; There is No Day Without Problems</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market in the countryside was only average, and the store purchases continued, and the shouts of visiting merchants suddenly rose. Speculators and retail hoarders came to cause trouble again. By the middle of the market, the prices of various imported rice had all increased by about 0.5 yuan compared to the previous market. No. 1 Saigon opened at 47.5 yuan, Fire Pattern sold at 46 yuan, Small Twist at 43.5 yuan, Tokyo Sharp Special at 43.3 yuan, 42.3 yuan, City at 42.5/6 yuan, 42 yuan, Mixed Broken at 36.8 yuan, Special Green Rice at 41 yuan. As such, the numbers hesitated. Later, the actual sales stopped due to the higher prices, and the market seemed to soften again. Ordinary speculators not only did not sell their holdings, but took this opportunity to buy, and the market had a tight feel. As for glutinous rice, it did not show up with the rise in imported rice, because generally, customers do not have much hope for the market, so they all focused on it, and the sales were very rare, so although the market held to the original price, there was no rise or fall, and the trend was softening. Domestic rice, such as thick japonica rice, thin indica rice, and early and late rice, was expensive, and off-market prices were weak, so there were no changes. Only early and late rice from Nangang traded at 47 yuan, with more than 500 bags of early and late rice from Hongkou.</p>
<p>In other news, although the import rice market showed a softening trend when it opened in the morning, it was soon bought by speculators inside and outside the industry, and the goods party also did not loosen their pricing due to the shrinking exchange rate and rising gold price, and refused to sell lightly with the market. The market gradually raised its price, and as a result, all rice rose by 0.3 to 0.5 yuan. The afternoon situation continued to show a firm trend, with reclaimed small twist from 51.45 yuan to 51.6 yuan, No. 2 Saigon from 52.55 yuan to 52.7 yuan, and No. 2 Siam was called late at 52.5 yuan. Before the close of the afternoon market, the goods party was even more firm and called for a price increase of 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, but there was no further agreement. The spot import rice trading volume was 5,000 bags, with futures at 600 tons.</p>
<h3>Reclaimed Flour Rises 0.5 Yuan; Wheat Market Stalls</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's market improved. No. 2 flour mill's trading was flat, with no change. Only reclaimed goods decorated the market, because recently, the Hong Kong syndicate slightly enquired, and sales in the hinterland villages were also active. In general, those who held warehouse receipts all wanted to defend. Old car brand sales opened at 14.8 yuan to 14.9 yuan, a sharp increase of 0.5 yuan compared to the previous day. Green cannon car was also calling for 15.15 yuan, but there was no formal market.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's trading became more stalled. After the recent decline in wheat prices, the Japanese mills had been trying to buy at a bargain, but the goods party had little inventory and was unwilling to sell lightly. In addition, the price of reclaimed flour was high, and people's hearts were looking forward to good news, so the goods party called for a higher price, while buyers were still thinking of suppressing it. As a result, there was no formal transaction.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Market Changes</h3>
<p>Recently, the soybean market situation has been difficult to revitalize after entering a decline. The enthusiastic attitude of all parties at the beginning of the year was mostly caused by manipulation and monopoly. Since the change in the market in the second half of last month, people's hearts have been downstream, and market prices have declined step by step. Central goods are almost unattended. Yesterday's market continued to fall, but sales were slightly active. A total of 300 bags of Dingjiazhou beans were traded at 26.5 yuan, 3 cars of Bengbu beans at 25 yuan, 1 car of Yuzhou beans at 23.5 yuan, 2 cars of Nanjing beans at 23 yuan to 20 yuan, and 50 bags of Pinghu Du beans at 25 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, yesterday (2nd) there were 2,520 bags of raw kernels and 2,714 cans of raw oil, all shipped from Qingdao to Shanghai. (3rd) Export miscellaneous grains included 7,350 bags of beans and 950 cans of raw oil shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Short Sellers Take Advantage; Cotton Yarn Falls; Double Horse Falls Below 900 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had risen sharply in recent periods, turned to decline today, but the buying and selling in the market was extremely active, so the market changed rapidly. However, the current yarn business is gradually improving, and the Hong Kong syndicate in South China is buying more actively than before, so all parties' minds are still thick. However, there was news of a peaceful truce in Europe, so a part of the short sellers were active, and floating sellers sold off and became loose. However, there are quite a few people who bought up on low prices. The highest price for the March contract was 930 yuan, falling to 904 yuan, and after closing it reached 911 yuan again.</p>
<p>The current yarn market opened in the morning due to the decline in foreign cotton and unfavorable news. There was a lack of buyers in the market. The opening price for the 20-count Fengma January contract was 525 yuan. As soon as this trade opened, sellers appeared one after another, and the market was looser. Shortly after, it fell to 916 yuan. Although it circled midway, people's hearts were still not encouraged. A certain short seller increased its position in a big way, and the market fell straight to 904 yuan. However, as soon as the trade opened, new buying sentiment rose again, and it rebounded again. However, the spot price of Double Horse yarn fell from 915 yuan to 890 yuan. According to the half-day trading statistics, 2,650 bags were traded. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 15 yuan. Today, 445 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, 15 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 40 pieces to Haikou, and 120 pieces to Haiphong. The amounts bought by each syndicate are listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 420, Counterparts: 2,205</p>
<p>Mainland: 25, Statistics: 2,650</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Slightly Weak; Cotton Flower Rise Slightly Weakened</h3>
<p>The trading of local cotton was slightly low, but the business of Indian cotton was booming again. Counterparts began to trade in large amounts, so the market was still good. However, both the factory and the Japanese side need cotton, so the market is still firm and expensive, but yarn prices are slightly weak, so it is also affected. The source of cotton from northern Jiangsu included 307 bags of Tongzhou flowers. The current cotton trading situation is listed below.</p>
<p>In other news, the New York cotton market opened this morning because speculators were selling, and later foreign cotton merchants listed for sale, and a part of the bulls settled. The market situation returned to weakness. As a result, the closing price fell more than 10 pounds compared to the previous day. There are rumors of a peaceful atmosphere in the Indian market of the European war, so the market is quite soft, and the forecast is for a sharp drop of 10 rupees. The Egyptian market is closed.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton trading yesterday was less lively than a few days ago due to the decline in overseas cotton markets, and people's hearts turned to weakness. The factory side still held a wait-and-see attitude, and if the price was cheap, they would buy a little, but it was only a sporadic transaction. The price of American cotton at Meiteng 6.875 yuan is converted to the factory price as follows:</p>
<p>20 count American Medium Strict Good Ordinary: 266.90</p>
<p>20 count Same Inferior: 25.60</p>
<p>32 count Same: 279.40</p>
<p>42 count Same Inferior: 267.40</p>
<p>32 count Same: 282.40</p>
<p>42 count Same Inferior: 267.40</p>
<h3>Securities: Foreign Stocks Fall More Than Rise; Domestic Debt Rises Strongly</h3>
<p>The securities gray market situation was strong and continued to rise yesterday, and buyers were quite active. The peaceful atmosphere also revived. Although it was pure imagination, many people in the market followed suit to fulfill their speculative wishes. The reasons for the rise were mostly due to tighter monetary conditions and the decline in gold and cotton yarn. This kind of rise is difficult to sustain. There were not many transactions in the morning, and the buying and selling parties still adhered to their consistent principles. Xinfu, Lemao, Lianyi and others bought, while the short side Hongkang, Jiufeng, Lianhe added positions. The market price rose slightly. In the afternoon, Xinfu, Shenkang, Lianyi, Tongkang, Datong and others collected. Class C shares rose to 48.65 yuan, but Jiufeng, Lianhe, Runli, Hongda, Xie Da and others sold, and the buying pressure was suppressed, and the trend was slightly weak. Although it was slightly weak after closing, the market was still tight, and there will be a competition next week. As a result, the market price continued to improve by two or three corners, and the turnover was over one million and ten thousand yuan. A more simplified table is shown below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: Turnover 500 shares of Trust Company stock, at a price of 1 yuan each.</p>
<p>The overall stock market situation was more declines than rises. The public bus company's unresolved strike problem resulted in a sharp fall of more than 1 yuan. Kailping Coal Mine and British United Shipyards also fell. The former fell from 64 yuan to 62 yuan, and the latter fell to 40.025 yuan. Other stocks also fell by 1 yuan to several corners. However, Hutchison Whampoa, Telephone, Gas and other stocks were still quite firm. Rubber stocks mostly loosened due to rumors of European peace in the market, but low-priced stocks such as Chen's were still not lacking buyers, and the result was a slight rise.</p>
<p>London 1st (Friday) Telegram: The listing of Chinese foreign debt in London today was still stable, and there were no changes in the upper and lower debt strips.</p>
<p>London 1st (Friday): Today, the stocks of British Far East companies listed in London were generally stable. Only Curla rubber stock continued to rise by 3 pence, to 2/6 shillings. The rest were the same.</p>

<h3>Textiles: Cotton Cloth Rise Slightly Halted; Sales to Nanyang Most Smooth</h3>
<p>Local Cloth: The rise in the cloth market slowed down yesterday. Blue has been rising very rapidly for the past few days, and the money supply is still tight. Speculators sold for profit, but actual sales were still good. Because the factory's current cloth prices are still not enough to cover the cost, the asking price is high, so people's hearts are stable, and the selling market is not moving. The goods are sold in small amounts, and the price is slightly lower by 0.25 yuan per piece. More than 500 pieces were traded in this street. The Zhejiang Wenzhou syndicate had the strongest demand, and continued to handle 300 pieces of coarse and fine cloth, bleached, dyed and printed cloth. Occasionally, the Guangdong syndicate also handled 150 pieces. The Henan and Shandong syndicates handled nearly 100 pieces of blue cloth, poplin, and printed cloth. The Tianjin syndicate handled more than 100 boxes of plain colored poplin, shilin cloth, and blue cloth. The Hong Kong Nanyang syndicate handled 5,500 pieces of bleached, dyed cloth, printed cloth, and twill.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: White goods, fine cloth, and fine twill, fell in the morning and recovered at noon. As a result, high-end Longtou fine cloth fell by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan per piece, while medium-end trumpets and colored balls were slightly weaker by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan due to the booming dyeing sales. Fine twill was relatively stable. The northern syndicate purchased 500 to 600 pieces of fine cloth for April delivery, so the Longtou forward price was still good, trading at 29.15 to 29.3 yuan per piece.</p>
<p>Export: 60 pieces of cloth were shipped to Hong Kong today, 87 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 41 pieces to Haikou, and 170 pieces to Haiphong.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Unchanged</h3>
<p>Yesterday's coarse white sugar was tight at first and then flat. As a result, it was similar to the previous day. The association's trading price was 62.5 yuan for 2/4 coarse white sugar in the local warehouse, and new arrivals in foreign warehouses were up 0.2 to 0.3 yuan, to 62.8 to 62.7 yuan, then to 62.5 yuan. Old goods were 62.2 yuan, transit goods were 49 yuan, Swire's B mark white sugar in the western warehouse was still 66 yuan, the eastern warehouse was 65.45 yuan, and the rest were discounted. The red and Dutch red sugar were unchanged. The local factory's snow white sugar was up 0.5 yuan, to 62.5 yuan. The local No. 1 rock sugar was 74.5 yuan, and Jingming rock sugar was 76 yuan. Local sugar was still firm. Yesterday, the Guangdong syndicate opened for sale 500 bags of Diao Qing sugar, at 47 yuan, up 0.5 yuan. The Chaozhou syndicate opened for sale 85 bags, at 46.8 yuan.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods: Black Fungus Stable</h3>
<p>Although there has not been much black fungus arriving lately, the sales were also low, so the market could not rise excessively. Yesterday, the slightly higher Sichuan fungus opened, at a price of 335 yuan, the ordinary price was 300 yuan, Yichang fungus was 270 yuan, and the shipping package fungus was 300 to 295 yuan.</p>
<h3>Seaweed: Domestic Laver Sold</h3>
<p>Due to the small production and rare sources of Ningbo laver, there have been several recent arrivals that have already been sold. The ordinary goods are 370 yuan, and the pulled vegetables are 400 yuan, which is quite profitable.</p>

<h3>Public Buses Resume Service This Morning: Due to Yu Qiaqing's Mediation, Work Resumes First; All Demands to be Further Negotiated Between Both Parties</h3>
<p>Following the strike by the workers of the British-owned public bus company, and after mediation by Yu Qiaqing of the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC), all workers have agreed to resume work first thing this morning. Regarding the thirteen demands made by the workers, direct negotiations will be conducted after work resumes. The company prepared everything last night, and all public bus routes will operate fully from this morning. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing Appointed as Mediator</p>
<p>In order to maintain transportation, the Chinese Public Bus Company is making every effort to restore the operation of all bus routes. Yesterday, the company continued to employ White Russian and Western personnel to drive and sell tickets, operating thirty buses on Routes 1 and 9. The fare was uniformly two jiao, regardless of distance. Furthermore, in order to resolve the strike as soon as possible, the company's manager, Xiao Tuo, visited Yu Qiaqing of the SMC (also a Chinese director of the Public Bus Company) the day before yesterday, hoping that Yu would act as mediator. At the same time, the workers also sent representatives to meet with Yu Qiaqing, requesting him to mediate.</p>
<p>Putting the Overall Situation First, Agreement to Resume Work First</p>
<p>After Yu Qiaqing agreed to mediate, he immediately urged both labor and management to understand each other, restore transportation, and advised the workers to resume work first. Regarding the conditions, Yu Qiaqing guaranteed that the workers would not be disappointed when labor and management negotiate directly in the future. The striking workers were deeply grateful for Yu's mediation. To respect Yu's wishes, they agreed to resume work immediately. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, worker representatives were dispatched to the company on Connaught Road to discuss resuming work with the company's manager, Xiao Tuo, and others.</p>
<p>Preparing Everything to Resume Operations</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the company yesterday that the company's Traffic Supervisor, Zhang Delan, had prepared everything last night, such as scheduling vehicles and arranging shifts. Starting this morning, all public bus routes will resume operations. As for fares, etc., everything will be handled as before. The temporary fare arrangements for Routes 1 and 9 during the strike period will be cancelled immediately.</p>
<p>The Union Issues a Notice</p>
<p>The union issued a notice yesterday, which read: "Notice: This matter is a decision made by all union members. Due to economic hardship, we unfortunately engaged in a work slowdown. Now, Mr. Yu Qiaqing has stepped forward to mediate and is responsible for handling the matter properly, and has advised us to resume work first and scheduled negotiations to begin next Monday. The union will certainly accept this. We urge all union members to resume work first thing tomorrow morning (Sunday) and await a resolution. This notice is hereby given. March 2nd, Republic of China, Year 29."</p>
<p>Expressing Gratitude for Assistance from All Sectors</p>
<p>The union issued a notice to thank Mr. Yu Qiaqing and thank all sectors for their assistance: "The union respectfully expresses its deepest gratitude to Mr. Yu Qiaqing for mediating this dispute on our behalf, running around for several days, mediating between labor and management, and providing absolute guarantees on behalf of the company that labor will receive satisfactory terms after resuming work (with letters and seals as proof). For the sake of social security, public transportation, and Mr. Yu's kindness, the union has decided to return to work at the factory this morning (March 3rd). After this unfortunate incident occurred, we received enthusiastic sympathy from all sectors, with expressions of concern and economic assistance. In addition to expressing our gratitude, we hope you will continue to offer your sympathy, assistance, and guidance. This notice."</p>
<p>The Company Accepts the Rice Subsidy Principle</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 12:00 PM, Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing met with representatives of the striking workers at the Sanbei Company on Guangdong Road. Yu stated that the main purpose of the workers' demands was the issue of rice subsidies due to soaring rice prices. The company has already negotiated the rice subsidy principle and is currently calculating the details. Therefore, he advised the workers to resume work first for the sake of maintaining transportation. The worker representatives were satisfied at the time and agreed to return and advise the workers to resume work, carrying with them a handwritten letter from Yu Qiaqing (original text omitted).</p>
<h3>French Concession Price Evaluation Committee: Three Subgroups Established</h3>
<p>In order to suppress prices within the French Concession, the French Concession authorities have organized a Price Evaluation Committee to handle this matter specifically. Its first meeting was held on the afternoon of the 29th of last month. It is now known that the committee has established three subcommittees: one for matters concerning rice and grain, one for matters concerning coal and other fuels, and one for matters concerning the retail of general necessities. Because the above three items are related to the lives of residents, specialized committees have been established to study and discuss solutions.</p>
<h3>Tens of Thousands Purchase Low-Priced Coal Briquettes: Purchasers are All Poor, a Pitiable Situation; Their Difficult Living Conditions are Clearly Evident</h3>
<p>The sale of low-priced coal briquettes began at 2:00 PM yesterday. Each coal briquette factory delivered the number of briquettes to be sold at each low-price sales point in the morning. The 14th low-price sales point, Xieyuan Coal Shop at the intersection of Connaught Road and Hart Road, stated that there were no poor people in the area and refused to serve as an agent for the low-price sale. Therefore, the ten dan that it was supposed to sell were merged into the 22nd sales point, Dasenhao at 126 Saposai Road (bringing the total to be sold there to forty dan). Also, the 17th point, Songtaichang, was mistakenly written as Zhentaichang yesterday. Therefore, the actual low-price sale was only held at fifteen locations, with a thousand dan sold each day.</p>
<p>Crowds of Purchasers</p>
<p>This time, the low-price sale of coal briquettes was limited to two jiao per person, so the purchasers were all poor people. The number of people was a thousand times greater than the last low-price sale. Before 1:00 PM, each low-price sales point was already packed with people. The authorities of both concessions deployed three to four patrolmen at each low-price sales point to form a straight line and maintain order. However, due to the jostling of the purchasers, the quantity of coal briquettes at each location was sold out by around 4:00 PM. A total of 25,000 people were able to purchase them, with total cash revenue of 5,000 yuan. However, another 40,000 to 50,000 people were unable to purchase them. Although the method has been improved, the procedures are still very cumbersome because it is necessary to weigh the coal on the spot. It is hoped that there will be further improvements.</p>
<p>Thorough Solution</p>
<p>During the low-price sale of coal briquettes, the Low-Price Sales Committee, the Coal Briquette Industry Association, and each coal briquette factory sent representatives, Chen Cuifang, He Ziguo, Yun Chunsheng, Han Pihao, and others, at 2:30 PM, to inspect each location in cars to prevent the low-price sales points from creating difficulties. Seeing the crowds of poor people purchasing the coal, the representatives realized how difficult their lives were and discussed discontinuing the low-price sales program only after the market price fell below six yuan. Otherwise, it was decided to hold the program long-term in order to reduce the burden on the poor.</p>
<p>Letter from the Coal Briquette Industry</p>
<p>A letter from the Coal Briquette Industry Association states: "In reference to the meeting held by our association on February 22nd, representatives from the seventeen factories earnestly requested that we issue a letter requesting that the Tongcheng, Hancheng, and Damao companies release raw materials. A draft was prepared on the spot, read aloud, and passed. It was certainly not suggested by any one person or intended to shield anyone. We have read the article 'Appeal from Small Coal Briquette Factories' in the local news section of your newspaper on February 1st. The representatives from Huacheng Yuan, Huaxin Ping, and other Huichang factories who attended the meeting stated that they were unaware of the matter. It is clear that there is another purpose. We are truly afraid of confusing the public and therefore request a correction."</p>
<h3>The Yunnan-Vietnam Transportation Gradually Returns to Normal</h3>
<p>Five Days, Four Nights to Travel to Yunnan; Freight Transportation is Unable to Flow Smoothly</p>
<p>Since the resumption of ordinary passenger trains on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway on February 18th, the departure times of all passenger trains on the Chinese section have been changed to evenings. As for the departure times of trains on the Vietnamese section, they remain unchanged and follow the previously set schedule. It takes five days and four nights to travel to Yunnan. On the first day, there are five express and slow trains from Haiphong to Hanoi, which takes just over three hours. On the second day, the train departs from Hanoi at 8:26 AM and arrives in Lao Cai at 6:40 PM. On the third morning, immigration procedures are completed at Hekou, and the train departs from Hekou at 7:17 PM. On the fourth morning, the train arrives in Kaiyuan at 8:23 AM. On the same afternoon, the train departs from Kaiyuan at 3:36 PM, and it can arrive in Kunming at 2:47 AM on the fifth morning. Passengers traveling in fourth class must change trains at Gia Lam and are not allowed to stay overnight in Hanoi. The journey can be shortened by one day. The trip from Kunming to Hekou also departs in the evening. Through tickets can be purchased from Haiphong to Kunming. The first, second, and third class train cars do not have sleeper facilities. Michelin trains have not yet resumed. As for freight transportation, the railway has now begun to accept shipments, but it is still unable to flow smoothly.</p>
<h3>Commemorating International Women's Day</h3>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Women Are Already Preparing</p>
<p>International Women's Day, March 8th, is fast approaching. The women's community in the city has begun preparations for the commemoration. Given the extraordinary times, the women's community does not plan to hold extravagant celebrations for Women's Day, but will intensify their efforts in their respective fields to fulfill the responsibilities of women during wartime. At that time, they will also promote the refugee relief movement to benefit the disaster victims. Foreign women will also hold gatherings as usual to celebrate.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Side States that They Will Continue to Control the Northern District; Trolleys and Buses Cannot Resume Operations; Japanese Naval Sentry Posts Will Still be Maintained; This is What They Mean by Returning Police Power in the Northern District</h3>
<p>The Yu Lin Newspaper reports that at a reception for reporters held by the Japanese side yesterday (the 1st), when asked about the restoration of trolley and bus services north of the Suzhou Creek, a spokesman claimed that the Japanese Public Bus Company is currently operating in the Northern District and that the company and the personnel of the British Public Bus Company will resolve the matter themselves. When a reporter asked about the issue of rickshaws with Shanghai Municipal Council licenses</p>
<p>Resuming Operations,</p>
<p>the spokesman replied that this matter requires further investigation. Another reporter asked, "The public bus and trolley companies have privileges granted by the SMC; is the SMC not concerned about this matter? The Japanese Public Bus Company has no municipal privileges, so how can the Japanese authorities reconcile the two parties?" A spokesman for the Japanese Navy replied that the Japanese Public Bus Company began operating under</p>
<p>Special Circumstances.</p>
<p>Restoring public bus and trolley services north of the Suzhou Creek would give undesirable elements an opportunity to resume their activities. The Japanese Navy opposes restoring these public services because this move would make it impossible for the Japanese side to maintain effective control. Therefore, this matter must be reconsidered. Asked whether the Japanese Navy intends to continue to</p>
<p>Deploy Sentry Posts</p>
<p>in the Northern District after establishing complete and sound police administration, the spokesman replied in the affirmative. Maintaining sentry posts is a defensive measure. A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy continued, "Returning police power is a step in the process of restoring normalcy, but a complete state of normalcy does not exist. Today, we must consider the actual situation carefully." Several points of</p>
<p>Difference</p>
<p>between the Japanese authorities and the SMC have been resolved peacefully, which is mutually satisfactory. Both sides and the "Shanghai Municipal Government" embrace a spirit of reconciliation. He is truly encouraged that these harmonious policies and resolutions will foster a better atmosphere. The Japanese authorities expect that relations between the Japanese, Chinese, and people of third countries will improve.</p>
<p>Exemption from Taxes Causes Significant Losses</p>
<p>The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury* reports that, according to information revealed this morning (the 2nd), the exemption of special taxes in the Northern District of the International Settlement from August 15, 1937, to December 31 of the same year caused the SMC to lose 1,118,011 yuan. 1,017,600 yuan was from general municipal taxes, and 100,400 yuan was from house taxes. In addition, the SMC also lost 255,387 yuan in unpaid taxes from 1937. According to an SMC official, residents of the Northern District</p>
<p>Suffered Losses</p>
<p>during the 1937 war, so the SMC granted the tax exemption. The authorities took similar measures during the 1933 Shanghai war, but the lost tax revenue was not even half of this amount. This morning, the reporter asked Mr. Philip, Director General and Chairman of the Board of the SMC, about the privileged status of the Shanghai Electric Construction Company and the Shanghai General Omnibus Company to resume operations in the Northern District. Mr. Philip replied that he was unable to comment on the matter but would</p>
<p>Consult with the Japanese Authorities</p>
<p>regarding this and other cases in the near future. In addition, according to an official of the trolley company, the Shanghai Electric Construction Company has absolutely no intention of relinquishing its privileges in the Northern District. After Japanese Consul General Miura and SMC Chairman Fessenden signed an agreement yesterday (the 1st), the police department is currently busy making the necessary preparations to fully regain control of the Northern District.</p>
<p>Residents of the Northern District Repeatedly Arrested</p>
<p>The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury* reports that, according to news from Chinese residents in the Northern District north of the Suzhou Creek, after the Japanese side abolished the通行證 (Tuōngxíngzhèng) [Pass/Permit] on February 14th and Chinese people flocked to the Northern District, the number of people arrested by the Japanese military authorities is unknown. It is said that several hundred people, mostly adults, have been arrested. Their fate is still unknown. Some have been released after being taken to Japanese military headquarters for questioning, while others, as rumored, have been</p>
<p>Taken to Taiwan</p>
<p>to work for the Japanese. Although the Japanese side denied the above claim in the *New Shenbao* this morning (the 2nd), it is heard from reliable sources that three or four nights ago, Chinese residents went to a theater in Hongkou to watch a play. When they left the theater after the show, the Japanese side checked their通行證 (Tuōngxíngzhèng) [Pass/Permit]. Those who did not have the permit or whose permit had been stolen were forced into</p>
<p>Trucks and Driven Away.</p>
<p>Their destination is believed to be Yangshupu. It is also heard that several dozen Chinese people were arrested in front of the barbed wire fence along North Jiangxi Road, with the most arrests occurring near Haining Road and Peng Road. There have been many instances of Chinese people showing their通行證 (Tuōngxíngzhèng) [Pass/Permit] only to have the sentry tear it up and forcibly shove them into vehicles. The Japanese military has conducted</p>
<p>Midnight Searches</p>
<p>in Dexing Lane at the intersection of Haining Road and Peng Road several times, awakening residents. Some of those who were taken away have not been heard from since. The rumor that Chinese people in Hongkou are being abducted has been circulating for several days, and today we have finally received reliable news.</p>
<h3>Today is Friendship Day</h3>
<p>Today is the sixth anniversary of Friendship Day. In these times of national crisis, there will be no extravagant celebrations, but most groups, schools, and organizations will hold simple commemorations. It is commendable that all sectors sympathize with friendship. A certain movie theater is screening "A Tale of Chivalrous Friendship." The YMCA will add a performance of "Long Live Friendship." The Hualian Tongle Association will perform the Peking opera "High Mountains and Flowing Water Seek a Soulmate." Initiator Huang Jingwan will speak about "The Way of Friendship" at the Youth Self-Study Group.</p>

<h3>French Municipal Council Balances Budget: Hopes to Avoid Raising Taxes; Strictly Enforces Economy and Controls All Expenditures; This Year's Budget Should Achieve a Balance Between Income and Expenses</h3>
<p>The *Continental Times* reports that Mr. Curtiss, an administrative director of the French Concession Municipal Council, stated to guests yesterday (the 1st) that, based on current observations, the French Municipal Council's financial situation for the end of the 1939 fiscal year did not have an imbalance between income and expenses. Since the budget has not yet been released, he cannot cite exact figures, but according to his observation, the Municipal Council's balanced budget is quite satisfactory. Although he cannot say for sure whether the Municipal Council will raise taxes, if no</p>
<p>Special Events Occur or the Value of the 法幣 (Fǎbì) [National Currency] Drops Sharply, then the French Concession can hopefully avoid raising taxes. The reason the Municipal Council did not have an imbalance between income and expenses last year was because it strictly enforced economy and controlled all expenditures. No funds can be allocated to any part of the Municipal Council without a vote by a special committee. Furthermore, if the Council discovers that certain departments have surplus funds, it does not immediately spend these surplus funds, because the Council knows that the situation may change and the funds may be needed. Therefore, it is</p>
<p>Extremely Cautious about Expenditures, and the Council always allocates funds according to the principle of what is most important and what is absolutely necessary. If it is necessary to economize on maintaining police services or parks, then the funds that are economized will be for the maintenance of parks. The French Municipal Council's ordinary budget revenue for 1940 is 16,799,480.86 yuan, and expenditures are 16,795,524.23 yuan. Therefore, the budget revenue exceeds the budget expenditures, but because prices continue to rise and the exchange rate is uncertain, the above cannot be considered</p>
<p>The Final Figures. The Municipal Council allocates approximately five million yuan to the police department and approximately three hundred thousand yuan to the health department each year. The Council purchased a large quantity of coal last summer, which can supply the city until the end of this year, so fuel costs have not increased significantly. However, the cost of providing heating to schools next year may increase sharply. Regardless of the price of coal, schools must have sufficient heating. As for purchasing a large quantity of coal for the residents of the French Concession, storing it, and adjusting the market price of coal, this is impossible. Because the French Concession has a</p>
<p>Dense Population, the Municipal Council cannot supply the coal needs, and this action would create panic in the market and give the public the impression that there is a shortage of coal, which would only worsen the current situation. Mr. Curtiss concluded by saying that he hopes that the Municipal Council's special committee investigating the market situation will lower prices. The committee will be more successful than any other group in this effort because its purpose is to solve this problem and to diligently study the reasons for the high prices of most necessities.</p>
<h3>The Minhe Steamer, Sailing from Wenzhou to Shanghai, Was Detained Again</h3>
<p>Detained for Four Days Before Finally Released; Yongtai Arrives in Shanghai, Daxin Missing</p>
<p>The foreign ships operating on the Shanghai-Tangshan line are frequently disrupted due to Japanese warships blocking the waters outside Wenzhou, resulting in frequent disruptions to their voyages. The foreign ships detained by Japanese warships outside Wenzhou on their way from Wenzhou to Shanghai last week, excluding the Yue Se and Tongcheng, which were released and arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, include the British ship Yongtai, which sailed back to Shanghai yesterday morning. According to company sources, this ship has no information, (it was sheltering from the wind in the Yueqing waters.) The Daxin ship is still missing. It is expected that it has been monitored by Japanese warships, so it has been unable to send a telegram even though it is en route. According to a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency, the Minhe ship, owned by the Portuguese company Wanguo Shipping, has been operating on the Shanghai-Wenzhou route. Since the Wenzhou route was interrupted the year before last, the ship has been anchored in Wenzhou for more than a year. Recently, it obtained approval from the Wenzhou-Taizhou Garrison Command and loaded passengers and cargo on the 25th of last month to sail from Wenzhou to Shanghai. However, it was blocked by Japanese warships when it sailed outside Wenzhou and Japanese soldiers were sent on board to inspect it, causing it to be detained outside the port for four days. After repeated negotiations by the shipowner, it was finally released on the afternoon of the 1st. The ship immediately set sail for Shanghai that night. Due to encountering wind en route, it anchored in Ligang and will arrive in port within one or two days. It is reported that it is carrying over six hundred dan of local products from Wenzhou.</p>
<h3>Lawyers Gu Shouxi and Yao Zhaoer Awarded French Government Medals of Honor</h3>
<p>According to French newspapers, lawyers Gu Shouxi and Yao Zhaoer of the French Concession Police Department have served for many years and have made outstanding contributions. The French government has specially awarded them the "翰林院 (Hànlín Yuàn)" [Hanlin Academy] Medal of Honor to show its appreciation. The order has already been issued. Also receiving the medal is Mr. Li Kater, Secretary-General of the Legal Department.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Jews Are About to Go to the Philippines for Farming</h3>
<p>The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury* reports that, regarding the US government's approval of Jewish refugees settling on Mindanao Island in the Philippines, leaders of the Jewish Refugee Committee in the city recently stated that three to four hundred Jewish refugees currently living in Shanghai who are familiar with agricultural work will leave Shanghai to settle on Mindanao Island. However, the date of their departure has not been decided. It may be within a month, or even within a year.</p>
<h3>The Jinxing Steamer Capsizes at the Zhenhai Port; All Passengers on Board Perish; The Ship Was Carrying Passengers to the Moufu Steamer Yesterday Morning; Disaster Caused by Small Ship, Too Many People, and Careless Navigation; No Detailed Reports on Rescue Efforts Afterwards</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping line was blocked by the Zhenhai Port blockade line, foreign ships have been anchoring at designated anchorages outside the port fortress. Passengers and cargo were loaded and unloaded using barges and tugboats, which caused many inconveniences and delayed ship schedules. Recently, in order to unload cargo and allow passengers to embark and disembark, the Ningbo side organized a Barge Transportation Management Office to handle cargo import and export and passenger transportation. Therefore, there are eighty to ninety barges of various sizes for transporting cargo, and several small steamers such as the Tianma, Tianbao, and Jinxing for transporting passengers. Recently, it has been going smoothly. Since the fall of Xiaoshan, people have been uneasy. Shipments from the city have decreased, while shipments arriving have surged. In order to facilitate passenger travel, the authorities have specially allowed smaller ships to enter the port. Therefore, the Gaodeng ship can now sail directly to the north bank of the Yangtze River. The Hana and Haikang ships are also considering traveling to Ningbo, but there is no news of their entry. Yesterday, the shipping industry in the city received a telegram from the Zhenhai branch company stating that this morning (yesterday), the Jinxing ship, carrying over three hundred passengers to the Moufu steamer, capsized due to its small size, too many people, and careless navigation, resulting in a tragic accident. All three hundred passengers perished. No detailed reports have been received regarding rescue efforts.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle at Erzao Hong; Japanese and Puppet Troops Suffer Defeat</h3>
<p>On February 25th, the Japanese and puppet troops in Pudong advanced in three directions towards Erzao Hong, the location of the Second District, led by District Chief Lian Baisheng. The first route consisted of seven or eight Japanese soldiers and over forty puppet soldiers, carrying two grenade launchers and five or six light machine guns. When they arrived about half a li southwest of Erzao Hong at around 7:00 AM, the First Company of the Second District Brigade unexpectedly attacked them with machine guns, killing several of the leading puppet soldiers immediately. A fierce battle then erupted, lasting until around 11:00 AM. A Japanese sergeant in command was killed, and many Japanese and puppet soldiers were killed or wounded. Three puppet soldiers then disguised themselves and swam to the Japanese in Nanhui County for help. The Japanese then sent reinforcements in two routes. One route, carrying a small cannon, a grenade launcher, and seven or eight light and heavy machine guns, arrived near Yaojiazhai. The other route, carrying two grenade launchers and four or five light and heavy machine guns, arrived at Situan Hong. Upon hearing the news, the Chinese side also sent reinforcements in two routes. At that time, the sound of cannons roared in all directions and machine guns fired intensively, and the battle was fierce. After fighting for over three hours, the Japanese and puppet troops in Situan Hong first retreated towards Situan Cang Zhuqiao Town. The southern route also retreated towards Nanhui County at around 4:00 PM, looting chickens, pigs, eggs, cloth, clothing, soybeans, rice, and other items from farmers' homes along the way, loading them onto five boats. In this battle, the First Company lost one soldier and one was seriously injured. On the Japanese and puppet side, according to reliable sources from the puppet troops, six Japanese soldiers were killed, two were seriously injured, thirteen puppet soldiers were killed, and over ten were seriously injured.</p>
<h3>Invention of Cosmic Rays: Coincides with Chinese Theories</h3>
<h3>Astronomical Changes Indicate Major Upheaval on Earth</h3>
<h3>Scientific Validation of Ancient Chinese Philosophies</h3>
<h3>Professor Millikan and Wife Depart for America by Ship Yesterday</h3>
<p>Professor Millikan, the inventor of cosmic rays, along with his wife and Professors Picard and Neher, concluded their cosmic ray measurement expedition from India.  During a stopover in Shanghai, they gave a brief lecture and departed Shanghai yesterday (29th) at 11:00 AM aboard the President Pierce. Before leaving, Professor Fan Fengyuan, representing the Chinese Institute of Engineers and Shanghai Great China University, boarded the ship to greet them and express welcome.</p>
<p>China's Future is Promising</p>
<p>Originally, Professor Millikan planned to lecture at Shanghai Jiaotong University. However, due to the ship's short, 24-hour stay in Shanghai, this plan was unfortunately not realized. He expressed optimism about China's future and sympathy for China in the Sino-Japanese war. He also lamented the plight of Jewish refugees in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Initial Discovery in India</p>
<p>Professor Millikan stated that the first measurements of cosmic rays were made in India in 1910. Subsequently, further experiments were conducted in North and South America, even in the ocean depths and the stratosphere. He found that cosmic rays are very rare.</p>
<p>Weak Magnetism Allows Easy Penetration</p>
<p>He later learned that the Earth's magnetism acts as a barrier to prevent cosmic rays from reaching the surface. Therefore, very few cosmic rays are measured near the Earth's north and south poles. At the equator, the center of the Earth's surface, the distance to the north and south poles is equal, resulting in the weakest magnetic field, allowing cosmic rays to easily penetrate. This is why he decided to go to India for measurements, which lasted three months and yielded very satisfactory results.</p>
<p>Method of Measuring Strength Differences</p>
<p>Professor Millikan also showed Professor Fan the instruments used to measure cosmic rays, including simplified versions. He explained how they are attached to balloons, how they ascend into the clouds, and how records are taken. Wireless instruments and precise automatic recorders are used, utilizing the ionization effect of cosmic rays on gases. The strength of the current indicated by the vacuum tube reveals the strength of the cosmic rays.</p>
<p>Chinese Theories Possess Profound Truths</p>
<p>Professor Millikan stated that cosmic rays have a very close relationship with human psychology and thought. Human evolution is entirely driven by cosmic rays. Ancient Chinese sages often said that astronomical changes portend major upheavals on Earth. This statement has considerable significance. Changes in sunspots, shifts in the Earth's magnetic field, all cause changes in the way cosmic rays penetrate to the surface.</p>
<p>Terrestrial Changes Caused by Evolution</p>
<p>Changes in human psychology, changes in thought, and changes in individual thought can all trigger wars. Truly, all human actions on Earth are shaped by evolution. The future changes in human life will be even more profoundly affected by the discovery of cosmic rays. The Bible and Buddhist scriptures both begin with the concept of light. The profound truths within them are only beginning to be understood with the discovery of cosmic rays.</p>
<p>Far-Reaching Impact of Future Changes</p>
<p>The world was once dark, and humans were like apes. Light, especially cosmic rays, arrived, and humanity began to evolve from apes into humans. Future changes in the world's written thought are deeply connected to today's research on cosmic rays. Finally, Professor Millikan presented several photographs and stated that his research findings would be published in New York in the shortest possible time, as all expenses are being funded by the Carnegie Institution of New York.</p>
<h3>Post Office Parcel Section to Relocate: Under Consideration</h3>
<h3>Possible Transfer to Other Branches: Implementation Pending Confirmation</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese side extended the barbed wire along Suzhou Road on North Jiangxi Road, access to the Shanghai Postal Administration Building has become extremely inconvenient for the public and postal workers alike. Although the postal authorities have sent representatives to negotiate, the Japanese side has yet to respond, affecting the postal service. According to a report from the Datong News Agency, parcel post used to be handled solely at the Administration Building. However, as the public is largely unwilling to travel through the restricted zone to mail parcels, the authorities are now considering relocating the parcel section to other branch offices. Once confirmed, the plan will be implemented to facilitate the public.</p>
<h3>Hydraulic Engineering Society Seeks Records of North China Floods</h3>
<p>The Hydraulic Engineering Society of China believes that the floods in Hebei Province and Tianjin last year were more severe than those in 1917. The Society plans to collect the following information: (1) Causes of the floods; (2) Maximum inundated area and size; (3) Riverbank breaches, including date, location, width, depth, and number of diversions; (4) Damage to dikes; (5) Discharge situation, such as the path of the water and the time of drying up; (6) Changes in rivers and lakes; (7) Estimated losses; (8) Suggestions for post-disaster relief; (9) Other relevant information. Any survey reports or personal records pertaining to the above are welcome. Please send them to the Chinese Institute of Engineers, P.O. Box 184, Hong Kong Post Office. If you wish to be compensated, please indicate this, and a reasonable amount will be paid.</p>
<h3>Buddhist Fellowship Distributes 300,000 Congee Tickets</h3>
<p>The Buddhist Fellowship is providing congee at eighteen congee shops in the two concessions, serving over six thousand people daily. Chairman Fan Cheng, a monk, stated that the congee distribution period has been extended to the beginning of summer. The number of congee tickets has increased to three hundred thousand. However, due to rising rice prices, each bowl, weighing fifteen taels, costs six fen at current prices. Congee tickets are sold in units of three yuan, which buys fifty tickets. He hopes that people from all walks of life will contribute generously. The Fellowship's address is inside the Dharma Treasure Hall at 418 Hart Road. Donation collection points: (1) National China Bank, Eight Immortals Bridge; (2) Southeast Trust Company, 134 Avenue Edward VII; (3) China Fiduciary Savings Bank, Jing'an Temple Road and Route Muri.</p>
<h3>Publication News</h3>
<p>The Sino-American Weekly, published by the American Roosevelt Publishing Company, features refined content and maintains a correct stance. Since its publication, it has been well-received by readers. The twenty-third issue has now been published, retailing for one dime in national currency.</p>

<h3>Multiple Criminal Cases Found Involving Weapons Seized from British Soldiers</h3>
<h3>In Addition to Firearms Confiscated by British Troops, the Police Department Has Also Seized Numerous Weapons</h3>
<h3>At Least Eleven Criminal Cases in the Past Two Years</h3>
<p>The "China Press" reports that British soldiers from the East Surrey Regiment seized firearms from "rogues" and thugs on Tuesday near the former Hua Bao Dang. It has now been confirmed that some of these weapons, after being investigated by the Public Security Bureau of the Public Concession, were used in major political shooting cases in Shanghai in the past. The groups to which these weapons belonged have repeatedly committed politically motivated acts of violence and resisted police and patrols in various parts of the city, especially in the lawless Western District. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Details of the Firearms Seized by British Troops</p>
<p>On Tuesday, a British military patrol, consisting of one corporal and five soldiers, apprehended thirteen suspects near a lane off Omei Road, seizing one rifle, eight various pistols, and one fake pistol. The pistols included four Mauser pistols, and one each of the Marlowe, Astra, Typhoon, and Francis types. They were handed over to the Firearms Section for examination, leading to a startling discovery.</p>
<p>Attack on Newspaper Office Last July</p>
<p>Firearms experts confirmed that the Mauser pistol and Astra pistol were used by thugs on July 2nd of last year to attack a Sino-American joint venture newspaper office at 160 Avenue Edward VII. The thugs threw hand grenades and opened fire, killing an American named Mr. Wilson who bravely assisted the police, and an rickshaw puller who happened to be passing by. Twelve others were injured, including two policemen.</p>
<p>Eleven Cases Committed</p>
<p>Furthermore, after examining the weapons, it was discovered that a certain group to which these firearms belonged had carried out twenty terrible operations in the city between 1938 and 1939. According to sources yesterday, in addition to the weapons seized by British troops on Monday, the police had seized many other firearms. It has been discovered that thugs have used these firearms to commit assassinations, attempted assassinations, attacks on Public Concession police, and other crimes to intimidate the public, totaling eleven cases.</p>
<p>(1) On November 9th of the previous year, a large-scale attack was launched on a gambling den at 65 Gordon Road, known as the "Asia Club." The "Club" was hosting a banquet to celebrate the engagement of a certain foreigner and a Chinese woman. Suddenly, thugs threw hand grenades and opened fire. The weapons used by the thugs belonged to this criminal group.</p>
<p>(2) One of the pistols was used in an attempted robbery of a Chinese dry cleaning shop at 506 Great World Road in June of last year. The shop owner's son called the police, and the robbers opened fire and fled.</p>
<p>(3) On the morning of June 15th of last year, a detective from the police department was patrolling Jessfield Road when he was shot at by armed thugs. Fortunately, the detective was not hit and gave chase, but the thugs escaped.</p>
<p>(4) On the evening of June 17th of last year, thugs used a pistol to threaten employees of the China University Bookstore at 20 Ningbo Road, firing several shots. A hand grenade was placed outside the door, but it did not explode and was safely removed.</p>
<p>(5) On the night of June 20th, several thugs attempted to rob the residents of 436 and 438 Robertson Road. The residents called the police, and the thugs fired four shots and fled without carrying out the robbery.</p>
<p>(6) In late July, the police department's search team engaged in a shootout with armed thugs on Wuzhen Road near Xinza Road. The thugs killed two and wounded one.</p>
<p>(7) On August 18th, thugs robbed a cotton mill at 255 Singapore Road. After the robbery, the thugs fired shots to intimidate the workers. Two days prior, these thugs had gone to the cotton mill and extorted five hundred yuan, claiming they would "visit again."</p>
<p>(8) In August of last year, a man named Zhang Yucun (transliteration) was shot and killed by thugs while walking in front of the South Caojiazhai in the Western District. The pistol used in the murder has been seized.</p>
<p>(9) These firearms were used by thugs on October 20th to attack Public Concession police officers directing traffic outside the concession on Yuyuan Road at the intersection of Edinburgh Road. The thugs killed Chinese Constable No. 3378 who was directing traffic and attempted to assassinate an Indian Constable who was also directing traffic at the intersection, but failed. The motive for this case, other than to intimidate Public Concession police officers working in the area, is unclear.</p>
<p>(10) A Public Concession Indian Constable was shot at by thugs outside 1464 Jessfield Road, but was not injured.</p>
<p>(11) On the morning of October 19th, there was a prolonged shootout in the suburbs near the intersection of Edinburgh Road and Brenan Road. The reason for the shootout remains a mystery. The police department has been unable to determine the cause of the fighting, nor whether there were any casualties.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Maybach Road: Robbers Wound Victim, Flee</h3>
<h3>Two Robbers Resist Arrest, Flee Scene</h3>
<p>At approximately 7:15 PM last night, two robbers arrived at 393 Maybach Road, Public Concession. One of them pulled out a firearm and ordered everyone to be silent. They stole a significant amount of jewelry and cash. As they left with the loot, one of the victims followed them, shouting "Robbers!" A Chinese Constable, No. 569, from the Chengdu Road Police Station, happened to be passing by and gave chase. Realizing they were in trouble, one of the robbers with a gun turned around and fired two shots at the constable. One bullet hit the constable's left leg, causing him to bleed profusely and collapse. By the time nearby patrol officers arrived, the two robbers had fled into the crowd. The wounded Constable No. 569 was taken to the police hospital for treatment by ambulance.</p>
<h3>Cruel Thug Kills Rickshaw Puller: Laborer Also Stabbed</h3>
<p>Rickshaw puller Feng Qingshan, approximately twenty years old, drove his rickshaw, No. 22101, to a repair shop on the bridge at Wuzhen Road and Xinza Road at approximately 6:00 PM yesterday. While the rickshaw was parked on the side of the road, a gangster demanded money from him. An argument ensued, and they began to fight. The gangster pulled out a knife and stabbed the rickshaw puller in the chest, piercing his back. Bleeding profusely, he collapsed. At that moment, the rickshaw puller's assistant, Li Deyu (34 years old, from Jiangbei), bravely stepped forward to apprehend the assailant. Unexpectedly, he was stabbed twice in the shoulder and once in the arm by the gangster. Covered in blood, the assailant eventually escaped. Nearby patrol officers arrived after hearing the commotion, but the assailant had vanished. Ambulance No. 83 was summoned to the scene and took the two injured men to Baolong Hospital. However, Feng Qingshan died en route due to his severe injuries. It was later learned that rickshaw No. 23101 belonged to the Deli Rickshaw Company and was rented to a Mr. Wang for business. The police are currently searching for the assailant.</p>
<h3>Pimping Thugs Lure Customers: Seize Opportunity to Rob</h3>
<h3>Two Criminals Arrested, Awaiting Investigation</h3>
<p>Recently, thugs in the Hongkou area have been using the guise of pimping to lure customers to brothels, taking advantage of intoxicated foreigners to steal their belongings. At 10:15 PM the day before yesterday, a Russian man named Shlankoenko was walking near the intersection of Avenue Edouard and Macleod Road. Due to excessive drinking, he intended to visit a brothel. While he was wandering around, a man from Jiangbei named Huang Xianchen (15 years old) approached him and said in English that he knew a good girl who could accompany him to a brothel. Mr. Shlankoenko was led into a dark alley, where he was surrounded by Hu Zhaolin, a Jiangbei man who ran a private brothel at 97 Macleod Road, and another man named Wang who is still at large. They pulled out knives and fake pistols, ordering him to be silent. They robbed him of a wallet containing American dollars, Japanese yen, and national currency worth 748 yuan and fled. After the incident, Chinese and foreign detectives from the Hongkou Police Station apprehended Hu Zhaolin and Huang Xianchen. The stolen goods were not recovered. The knives were seized, and the criminals were taken into custody. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police Attorney Qian Qiongjiu charged them with robbery and requested a postponement. Later, the Russian man, Shlankoenko, testified to the events, identifying the defendant Huang Xianchen as the person who lured him to the brothel. When questioned, the two defendants gave evasive answers. Judge Huang Risheng ordered them to remain in custody and adjourned the hearing.</p>
<h3>Pushan Village Appeals to All Sectors for Donations</h3>
<h3>Soaring Wood Prices, Gasoline, and Labor Costs: Burial Services Urgently Need Funds</h3>
<p>Pushan Village has been providing burial services for years, initially without reliable funding. It has been maintained only through the continuous donations of philanthropists from all walks of life. In 1939, the village buried over 41,000 bodies, large and small, and provided 12,878 coffins, large and small. With the rising prices of all goods, the cost of wood alone has more than tripled. Other expenses, such as gasoline and labor, have also continued to increase. The village is appealing to philanthropists from all sectors to make generous donations and extend their benevolence to the deceased.

<h3>Fake Police About to Rob</h3>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" reports that a taxi stand on a side street off the Great West Road in the Shanghai West area was robbed of 300 yuan by two armed men four days ago. The employees of the taxi stand decided to report the incident to the nearest police station the next day.

As a result, they did not say a word after entering the station and quickly left.</p>
<h3>Gambling Dens in Nanshi Closed Yesterday</h3>
<h3>It is Difficult to Know if They Have Been Banned</h3>
<p>The French authorities recently sent a letter to Du Yuesheng, requesting that he order the so-called "Nanshi District Government" to ban existing and planned gambling dens in Nanshi to maintain public order. It is reported that Du Yuesheng has not yet given a formal reply. However, yesterday morning, all the gambling dens that had opened in Nanshi, such as Shengsheng Company and several others, suddenly sent people to tear down all the red paper signs posted at the entrances and closed the doors tightly. As a result, when people went to investigate yesterday afternoon, all the gambling dens were deserted. However, it is not yet known whether they have been formally banned.</p>
<p>(Additional News) Since the iron gates at the New Bridge and other areas in the French Concession near Shanghai City's Ji畝地 and Ximen were opened, a group of gangsters have rented large buildings and opened gambling dens. Five or six have already opened. However, for unknown reasons, three or four of the gambling dens that had opened have closed in recent days.

<h3>A Strange and Fortuitous Encounter</h3>
<p>In Yue County, there was a man named He from Sijia Mountain, whose family was impoverished and made a living by working as a hired laborer. Every year during the harvest season, people from Yue County often went to the Qiantang sandbars to work as short-term laborers for farming families. He also went with three companions to sit in a teahouse to wait for employers. He jokingly said to his companions, "This year, whoever hires us must have a daughter, only then will I agree to work, as I have a small matter to attend to." His companions all secretly laughed at him. It happened that a Mr. Jiang, who needed to hire short-term laborers, was in the teahouse looking for people. Hearing He's words, he felt quite resentful, so he hired his companions but refused to hire He. His companions said to He, "Tonight you have no place to stay, after dinner you can come to Jiang's house to ask for lodging." He nodded in agreement. After dinner, the companions told Jiang about the request for lodging, but Jiang firmly refused, and immediately ordered the door to be closed, leaving the companions helpless. Although Jiang was a farmer, he was wealthy. He had a daughter who was of marriageable age, and she had a secret affair with her cousin, and they were planning to elope that very night. Outside the back window of the bedroom was the main road. As the night deepened and people became quiet, the daughter leaned alone against the window and waited, but her cousin was unable to come due to important matters. He arrived at Jiang's house to seek lodging, but found the door already closed. He wandered outside the garden wall. The daughter heard footsteps below and thought her cousin had arrived, so she threw down two large cloth bundles from the window, and secretly opened the back door to leave. He was at a loss, when suddenly he saw the large bundles thrown down. He picked them up and found them quite heavy, and was delighted, thinking it was a gift from heaven. He carried them and walked away, and the daughter followed behind him. To avoid being discovered, they did not speak to each other. After walking two or three miles, they reached a cool pavilion. He was quite exhausted, so he entered the pavilion to rest. The daughter arrived in front of him, and they looked at each other in great surprise! She wanted to return but could not, so she explained the whole situation to He, and expressed her willingness to marry him. He was not yet married, so he rented a house in Linpu and lived there with her. He used the seven or eight hundred yuan he had obtained as capital for a small business, and they lived harmoniously and comfortably, gradually becoming well-off. Just this spring, Jiang found out and came to recognize his daughter. He acted as if he were a father-in-law and son-in-law who were afraid of each other, and he sent another three hundred thousand in dowry money. This was truly a strange and fortuitous encounter.</p>

<h3>On Making Friends</h3>
<p>— Yiyi Guan Zhu</p>
<p>Everyone, regardless of gender or age, cannot avoid making friends while living in this world. Boys have male friends, girls have female friends, adults have adult friends, and even children have young friends.</p>
<p>However, if one is not careful in making friends, it is extremely dangerous. Because friends are like a blacksmith's furnace. If you befriend good people, it is like throwing iron into that furnace, which can be forged into useful steel. In other words, befriending good people can increase your knowledge, correct your mistakes, and make you a useful person. If you befriend bad people, then you are like a piece of iron thrown into a bad furnace, which will not only fail to forge useful steel, but will also ruin you! In other words, making bad friends will not only lead you down a path of depravity and destruction, but will also cause your original pure and kind character and behavior to be assimilated and transformed. As the saying goes, "Those who are near vermilion get stained red, and those who are near ink get stained black." From this perspective, isn't it dangerous and frightening to be careless in making friends? Therefore, the ancients said, "A gentleman is cautious in making friends."</p>
<p>In short, once a person lives in this world, whether male or female, young or old, they cannot live in isolation and must need to make friends. Boys have male friends, girls have female friends, adults have adult friends, and even children have young friends, as mentioned above. Therefore, I hope all of you dear children, you must be careful when making young friends now, and you must be even more careful when making adult friends when you grow up!</p>
<h3>Koxinga Bottle</h3>
<p>— Gang</p>
<p>Young friends must be unfamiliar with the name "Koxinga Bottle." Here, I can tell you the origin of the Koxinga Bottle, because it is also worth knowing.</p>
<p>During the late Ming Dynasty, Koxinga resisted the Qing Dynasty. Seeing the importance of Quanzhou, he set up artillery platforms along the coast. He usually stored the gunpowder he used in long magnetic bottles. When the gunpowder was used up, he would throw the bottles into the sea. Because the Tang King bestowed the surname Zhu on Koxinga, people generally called him Lord Koxinga, and this type of bottle was named the Koxinga Bottle.</p>
<p>Koxinga Bottles are now regarded as珍品珍品, because they are in the sea, they are either caught by fishermen or washed up by the tide. The most valuable ones are those with shells attached to the outside of the bottle. The more shells, the longer the age. Now it is not easy to buy them in the Quanzhou area, and even if there are, they cost dozens of gold coins each. Especially because they are used to commemorate heroic figures who served the people, people are scrambling to buy them.</p>
<p>Although Koxinga Bottles seem unfamiliar to us, they are worthy of our commemoration and should be known.</p>
<h3>Bombing</h3>
<p>— Xianming</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, newspapers often contain news such as "Airplanes fiercely bombed cargo trucks, but according to the information obtained, the losses were minimal..." or "On a certain day, several airplanes bombed a certain airport, destroying several planes..." Yong'er doesn't bother to read such unfavorable news because it doesn't pique his interest. But if he sees our planes bombing enemy positions, he must read it and study it carefully, not wanting to miss anything, while also showing a joyful expression. Moreover, he also has a strong ambition, which is to become a pilot in the future and drop bombs to bomb other people's important locations, the "boom" sound is so exhilarating! This is his daydream, his brother - Zong'er often says about him. However, he is not very clear about the matter of airplane bombing, which is what he urgently needs to know.</p>
<p>"Brother, what exactly is bombing? Is it very interesting?" He asked in this way.</p>
<p>"I once read a book about airplanes, and it told us: Airplane bombing is not an easy task. We especially want to fly the plane to our destination, and then quickly dive down. When the distance between our plane and the destination becomes close, we aim the bomb at the destination and drop it, then we hear a "boom" sound, accurately destroying the destination. But the result is greatly contrary to your ideal. In reality, the bomb will never casually listen to you and fall to the destination you want to bomb. If you carefully examine the situation of dropping bombs from an airplane, you will find a very strange phenomenon. You know, the dropped bomb and the airplane seem to be connected by invisible lines, as if there is a suction force that keeps it under the airplane. By the time the bomb reaches the ground, it is very far away from the destination you want to bomb. Not only does it not achieve the effect of bombing, but it also wastes the value of a bomb. What is the reason for this? This phenomenon proves Newton's first principle - the law of inertia: Because when the bomb is on the airplane, it is being carried along with the airplane. When you drop it, it leaves the airplane and falls down. However, it will not lose its original speed in the air. At the same time as it falls, it must continue to complete the movement it just made in the air, resulting in two movements: vertical (falling) and horizontal (the airplane moving forward). As a result, the bomb has to fall in a curved arc, which is far away from the destination you aimed at. Therefore, to make bombing accurate, you must calculate the airplane's speed, the bomb's descent conditions, and the wind speed in advance. Being a pilot is not easy. I don't approve of you being a pilot who invades others. I only hope that you will be a pilot who serves the people properly in the future, that is glorious!"</p>
<h3>Friendly Animals</h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>There are many very strange friendly relationships between animals. For example, when a cat sees a bird, it inevitably has a big appetite and drools, which children know.</p>
<p>However, in Brownswood, Australia, there is a man named Weiss who keeps a cat and also raises a partridge. The cat and the bird live together daily and have become very good friends. They are very affectionate with each other. Not only does the cat not have the slightest intention of harming the partridge, but it also protects it everywhere. The little partridge often sleeps sweetly in the cat's arms, and the cat also uses its claws to hug the partridge tightly. This sincere spirit of mutual affection and love cannot be compared to those who are fierce inside and pretend to be friendly on the face. Although they are called humans, they are truly inferior to these animals!</p>
<h3>New Fable</h3>
<p>— Gongchao</p>
<p>The snail crawled slowly on the ground, slower than the slowest tortoise. A long trail of mucus remained behind its body, reflecting the sunlight and emitting colorful radiance. The snail often looked back triumphantly, thinking, "This is the rainbow on the ground. No other animal in the world can create it!"</p>
<p>As it crawled, it suddenly saw something pale white and segmented, like a tall city wall, blocking its path and preventing it from moving forward. It looked closely and realized it was a snake skin. It said disdainfully,</p>
<p>"A snake skin, a dead thing! Once, I competed with a live snake in length, and I only stretched out half of my body, but it was still shorter than one of my antennae. We also competed in speed. I had already reached the destination, but it was still lagging behind in my rainbow, admiring its beauty. Even a live snake lost to me. Hmph, you dead thing, how dare you block my path!"</p>
<p>Before it finished speaking, the small green snake that had shed the skin, not having gone far, replied, "Mr. Snail, you have such a long body and such fast feet, I would like to learn from you. Come, let's compete! If you lose a little, I'll eat you!"</p>
<p>The snail was so frightened that it retracted its entire body into its shell and did not dare to stick its head out for a long time.</p>
<h3>Youth and Old Age</h3>
<p>— Zhao Yilin</p>
<p>Mulaolin's Fable</p>
<p>A greedy young man said to his father, "My dear father! Please treat me better and tell me how to seek happiness." The old man said, "This is a glorious pursuit; to obtain happiness, one must work as usual, using their talents to serve their country day and night." "Alas! Living like this is too tiring! I want to do a job that requires less effort." "The most reliable method is to be a spy." "That is dishonorable. I want to obtain wealth, but I am unwilling to sin or work." The old man sighed and said, "Then it is difficult!"</p>
<h3>Black Brothers (8)</h3>
<p>— Yimu</p>
<p>The pot made another sound, saying: "Come, Grell, my child! I am still beautiful, quickly pour me out." But Grell was extremely surprised and stood there motionless. The voice, with some impatience, shouted again: "I tell you, quickly pour me out." Grell was still motionless. The voice, with a pleading tone, said: "Can you pour me out? I am really too hot."</p>
<p>Grell steadied himself, and only then did his hands begin to move. He took the pot off the stove and slowly poured out the molten gold. But what was poured out was not liquid gold, but first two beautiful golden legs stretched out, followed by the lower hem of a robe, then a pair of small arms were seen, and finally the head of his old friend, the gold cup. These legs, robe hem, arms, and head rolled out of the pot one by one, and when they reached the ground, they mixed together and transformed into a golden dwarf, about one and a half feet tall.</p>
<p>The dwarf said happily, "This is good!" He first stretched out his legs, then his arms, and then shook his head up and down several times, for about five minutes, constantly stopping, as if testing whether all parts of his body were assembled correctly. Grell watched silently, extremely surprised. The dwarf wore a tight-fitting garment woven from gold thread, woven very finely, the triangular luster flashing as if it were the surface of a pearl. His hair and beard draped down from the garment, long and thin, intertwined, Grell simply could not see the end of it, seeming to blend with the air. However, his face was not as refined as his clothing and hair, but rather rough, and the color was somewhat like copper.</p>
<p>After examining himself, the dwarf fixed his sharp little eyes directly on Grell's face for a full minute or two before speaking, "Grell, my child, this is impossible." Grell was startled by these words and did not know what he meant. He followed his tone and said gently, "Sir, impossible?" The dwarf replied, "Yes, impossible." As he spoke, he pressed his hat over his eyebrows, made two spins in the room, lifting his legs high and landing heavily.</p>
<p>Grell looked at him for a while, felt that there was no reason to be afraid, and asked tentatively, "Sir, are you my gold cup?" The dwarf suddenly turned around, walked straight in front of Grell, straightened his body, and said loudly, "I am the King of the Golden River." After saying this, he made two big spins, returned to Grell, and stood still, as if waiting for Grell's response. Grell had to say softly, "I hope everything is well with you."</p>
<p>The dwarf ignored his polite greeting and said to himself, "Listen! I am what you mortals call the King of the Golden River. I was transformed into the shape you saw me in before by a spell of a more powerful king. Being melted by you in the pot has freed me. I have seen the actions of you and your two evil brothers, which has made me willing to help you; you should also listen to my words and do as I say."</p>

<h3>On Flags in Peking Opera</h3>
<p>— Junmei</p>
<p>Peking Opera is based on singing, and every movement contains elements of dance, so the props used in the opera are those that are easy to manipulate. Flags are also one of the main props in Peking Opera, mainly used to represent the movement of troops, battles, and the direction of officials in the opera. Wind, clouds, rain, snow, yin and yang, and orientation are also often symbolized by flags. The audience can understand them at a glance. There are many types of flags that are commonly seen but not noticed, such as red gate flags, black gate flags, water flags, and chariot flags. A brief description is as follows:</p>
<p>Red Gate Flag: The red gate flag is made of red cloth without colorful paintings. It is widely used to represent auspicious occasions, such as the red phoenix star in "Red Phoenix Joy," and the parade of the top scholar and weddings. It is always used as a guide in front. When the god of fire appears, it is sometimes used because the color red contains the meaning of fire. Also, if a character in the opera is beheaded, this flag is used to wrap their gauze hat or chignon, also to represent dripping red blood.</p>
<p>Black Gate Flag: The black gate flag is also called the wind flag. It is square and black. If there is a strong wind in the opera scene, this flag is waved on the stage, hence the name. It is used to represent ghosts traveling by wind, such as when Tuo Zhao Peng Bei and Qi Lang appear, four people hold black flags in front. It also represents an ominous meaning, hence the name black gate flag.</p>
<p>Water Flag: The water flag is made of white cloth, with water patterns painted on it, representing water waves. When there is drowning, rescue, or naval battles, this flag is used.</p>
<p>Chariot Flag: The chariot flag has a wheel shape painted on the flag surface. One person holds two flags and walks in the middle, representing the arrival of a chariot. Those who ride in chariots in the opera are mostly female characters. Only Zhu Wanliang is a male character.</p>
<p>The above four flags are commonly seen in Peking Opera. In recent years, male warrior characters, in addition to being brave and fierce, have been waving colorful silk flags, which are colorful and dazzling. It is unknown what meaning is taken from using them in dangerous battles.</p>
<h3>Casting of "Dream of the Red Chamber" Confirmed: Chen Yunshang Cross-Dresses as Jia Baoyu, Yuan Meiyun and Chen Yanyan to Play Lin Daiyu and Xue Baochai Respectively</h3>
<p>— Yinbing</p>
<p>The Xinhua Film Company's plan to produce the entire "Dream of the Red Chamber" dates back to three years ago. They had been considering it for a long time, but hesitated due to the scale of the project. It was not until recently that they put the original plan into practice. There are several major difficulties in the filming of this film. (1) Script - The plot of the book is complex and extremely trivial. Dividing and organizing it into segments while trying to avoid dullness and vulgarity makes the work of shot division very difficult. (2) Background - The Grand View Garden is full of layered pavilions, magnificent and luxurious, making the set construction extremely vast. (3) Actors - There are many characters in the book, and there are even more female roles below the Twelve Beauties. It is not easy to find actors who fit the personalities and allocate them appropriately. For these three issues, Xinhua has experts draft the script; the set uses the entire grounds of the Dingxiang Garden, which is fortunately full of flowers and trees, making it twice as effective with half the effort; and the allocation of important actors has been largely determined: the only central character, Jia Baoyu, will be cross-dressed by Chen Yunshang. Lin Daiyu will be played by Yuan Meiyun, who has a delicate physique, Xue Baochai will be played by Chen Yanyan, who has a plump and jade-like appearance, and the role of Wang Xifeng will still be played by Gu Lanjun, who played in "Havoc in Ningguo Mansion."</p>
<p>Having a female actor cross-dress as Jia Baoyu is indeed a better solution. Because there are very few talented young male actors suitable for playing the refined and romantic Jia Baoyu, it is absolutely impossible to find one. "Dream of the Red Chamber" focuses on depicting the love between brothers and sisters, and if Baoyu is played by a male actor, it is inevitable that it will be difficult to perform a more passionate and thorough performance. Chen Yunshang is charming, lively, and still has a bit of masculine energy; playing this role is very suitable, and it seems like a unique flavor of "Girl Incarnation," which is enough to make the "Dream of the Red Chamber" film a great success.</p>
<h3>Examination of "Chopping the Classics Hall" (7)</h3>
<p>— Xiaotian</p>
<p>"Chopping the Classics Hall," also known as "Wu Han Kills His Wife," tells the story of the late Wang Mang period. The opera includes scenes such as Liu Xiu fleeing the country, being captured at Tongguan, lecturing his son on injustice, Wu Han killing his wife, the virtuous mother exhausting her virtue, and abandoning Mang to return to Han. Wu Han's wife is the daughter of Wang Mang, a member of the Xin Dynasty's royalty. The entire opera is sung in a minor key. It became quite popular after Qilin Tong played the lead role, and it was later made into a film. According to the "Book of the Later Han Dynasty, Biography of Wu Han": "Wu Han, courtesy name Ziyan, was a native of Wancheng in Nanyang. His family was poor, and he served the county as a pavilion chief. At the end of Wang Mang's reign, he violated the law as a guest, so he fled to Yuyang. Lacking funds, he made a living by selling horses, traveling between Yan and Ji. Everywhere he went, he made connections with heroes. When Gengshi was established, he sent an envoy, Han Hong, to inspect Hebei. Someone said to Hong, 'Wu Ziyan is a remarkable man who can be consulted. Hong summoned Wu Han and was very pleased with him, so he appointed him as the magistrate of Anle." It is said that Wu Han only served as an official under Gengshi. During Wang Mang's reign, he was a horse trader. How could he marry a princess and be called a prince consort? The biography also states, "When Wang Lang rose up, the northern states were disturbed. Wu Han had long heard that Guangwu was a virtuous man and wanted to return to him alone. So he persuaded the governor Peng Chong, saying, 'The cavalry of Yuyang and Shanggu are known throughout the world. Why don't you combine the elite troops of the two commanderies and attach them to Duke Liu to attack Handan? This is a great opportunity. (Omission) Chong agreed, so he sent Wu Han to lead troops and join forces with the generals of Shanggu to the south. Everywhere they went, they attacked and killed Wang Lang's leaders. Guangwu at Guang'a appointed Wu Han as a partial general and granted him the title of Marquis of Jian Ce." From this, it can be seen that Wu Han's return to Han and his uprising took place in Yuyang, and his audience took place in Guang'a. His meritorious deeds were persuading Peng Chong to attack Wang Lang. None of this can be borrowed or associated with the plot of "Chopping the Classics Hall." Some say that the compilation of this opera is likely from "Romance of the Eastern Han Dynasty" (I have not seen it and do not know if it is true). I don't know where "Romance of the Eastern Han Dynasty" is based on.</p>
<h3>Dynamics of Hua Guo Drama School</h3>
<p>— Heyun</p>
<p>Recently, the liveliness of spoken drama seems to have become a special ornament on the isolated island. This phenomenon can be said to have broken historical records. In fact, drama - especially spoken drama - is a simple and powerful educational tool that can reflect life and society anytime and anywhere. So, in today's new era when the alarm bells are ringing all over the land, it is natural that it can be so vibrant. As a result, the emergence of drama clubs and drama troupes, the performance of famous plays, and the establishment of schools have given the people of the country great excitement.</p>
<p>At this time, the Hua Guo Drama School also met with the public. Hua Guo Drama School focuses on various academic subjects and skills within the scope of spoken drama. For example, directing, screenwriting, performance, makeup, dance, scenery, lighting, effects, etc., are still under training, hoping to cultivate specialized talents in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Now, Hua Guo has officially started classes, with more than 40 male and female students. It is said that currently, in addition to attending classes, they are also rehearsing a famous one-act play, which is said to be performed at the Xuan Palace Theater in the near future.</p>
<h3>Unofficial History of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Yang Xiaolou Admires Li Chunlai (Part 2)</p>
<p>When Li performed Bai Shui Tan, he played the role of the Eleventh Young Master. Wearing a straw hat ring, after reciting "Seeing death and not saving is not a true man," he stood at the edge of the stage and first bowed. When his head was raised, the straw hat ring had already flown to the top of the stage. At that time, there were two people above who were specifically responsible for catching the hat. The one who caught it would be rewarded with two yuan after the show. If both failed, they would be severely punished by Li. Also, when Li had no show during the day, he often personally supervised the acrobatic troupe's training, holding a cigar in one hand and a whip in the other. Whenever he ordered someone to do a somersault, he would call out "One more, one more" non-stop. The person performing the somersault had to continuously somersault according to his voice. If there was any delay, or if they were ordered to somersault but had no strength, they would be whipped by Li. Chunlai became famous in Shanghai during his prime with the play "Bai Shui Tan." Therefore, one day when Li was scheduled to perform the play, Xiaolou arrived at the backstage an hour early, constantly peeking out from behind the curtain. Chunlai was naturally extra enthusiastic. When he threw the straw hat ring, he still didn't use his hands, wanting to show off his skill with his head. Although he was old at that time and lowered it slightly, this unique skill was still something that others couldn't do. (The Tianchan Terrace was high, so he had to have someone catch it in front of the curtain) Also, when the male and net characters were fighting, each held one end of a stick (in fact, the stick represents the shoulder pole used by the Eleventh Young Master to carry meat, but it is used as a weapon during battle). The male and net characters simultaneously did a somersault in place, rising and falling together, extremely fast. After standing still, they were not out of breath or shaking, and you couldn't see that he was an old man over sixty. After he finished the scene, as soon as he stepped into the backstage, Boss Yang rushed to his side, took Chunlai's hand, then stretched out his thumb several times, and called out repeatedly, "Old hero, old hero." Chunlai certainly had a proud look on his face, and Ju Dekui (who played Qingmianhu), who was acting with the old man, also felt very honored.</p>

<h3>How to Relieve the Economic Hardship of Families: Focusing on the Big Picture and Addressing the Details</h3>
<p>— Wind</p>
<p>Family problems have currently become the most serious general problem. This is a unique wartime phenomenon that cannot be addressed with conventional methods. In peacetime, every family has a normal income, and prices are at a certain level. When family finances run into trouble, it's usually due to poor management or unnecessary waste by family members. In that case, the most important solution is for individuals to adjust their spending habits. However, the current situation is different. Due to soaring prices, most families, even with maximum austerity measures, are unable to maintain their livelihood. The reason for this is not individual fault but the result of societal factors. Therefore, trying to solve the problem from an individual perspective is futile. It requires a collective solution from society.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, when war breaks out in any country, the government controls essential daily necessities such as food and fuel. They make advance estimates of stockpiles. If there is a surplus, they figure out how to handle it. If there is a shortage, they figure out how to allocate it. They also set maximum prices to prevent the price of essential daily necessities from rising and strictly prohibit speculation to avoid market chaos. Shanghai, in its unique situation, never took this step. Last year, local authorities imposed price limits on food, but this was merely a belated effort after the fact, not proactive planning. This year, market chaos has resumed, and the price limits on rice have long been broken. The soaring price of coal also cannot be stopped. Although warehouses are stocked with large quantities of coal, the warehouse receipts are in the hands of speculators who use them to manipulate and hoard. Each ton of coal costs over two hundred yuan, causing the price of coal to skyrocket, resulting in an unprecedented situation. Despite efforts by business leaders to suppress prices, the results have been limited.</p>
<p>Strictly punishing speculation is undoubtedly the most important measure right now. However, this passive approach alone cannot solve the current problem of soaring prices. It still requires the concession authorities and business leaders to raise substantial funds to investigate existing stockpiles of essential goods. If there is a shortage, they should purchase in large quantities to stabilize prices. The Shanghai People's Food Adjustment Committee's fundraising and group purchase of rice can be considered the most successful collective action in adjusting rice prices recently. However, this method is not widespread enough. Those who can afford to buy ten yuan's worth of rice are, by definition, not within the reach of the average middle-class person. The lines for subsidized rice stretching half a mile long are filled with people who can only afford to buy five or ten liters of rice at a time to make ends meet. They certainly cannot afford to buy a stone or two of rice to store at home for consumption. The group purchase of rice inevitably excludes these people. Subsidized rice sales are of great help to these people, but this measure needs to be sustained. Subsidized sales are implemented during peak price surges but are suspended when the situation calms down slightly. This is not a thorough solution. Therefore, this problem should be comprehensively planned to achieve widespread and significant results. This can be done in several ways: First, employers of major companies and factories in Shanghai can allocate funds from their surplus to purchase essential daily necessities and sell them to their employees at prices lower than the market rate, without the aim of profit. This is a simple effort for employers, while employees can purchase daily necessities at much lower prices than the market. Second, since the start of the war, Shanghai has been flooded with idle capital, which is not being used properly and is mostly used for manipulation and speculation. If this idle capital could be used for investment in consumer cooperatives, similar to past credit cooperatives, it would be many times more beneficial to social welfare. During this period, the organization of consumer cooperatives is essential to promote. However, cooperation should not be limited to consumer cooperatives. Other cooperative ventures, such as medical cooperatives to improve personal health, educational cooperatives to educate children and reduce personal burdens, and thrift cooperatives, can all help with family finances and should also be promoted. Furthermore, the basic spirit of cooperatives is so-called democracy. At a time when constitutionalism is being promoted, the organization of these cooperatives is also a good way to cultivate the spirit of democracy. This is also more worthy of our promotion and joint research to find a more reasonable solution to family finances in today's abnormal society.</p>
<h3>Adjusting Family Finances</h3>
<p>— Yan Zheng</p>
<p>It is impossible to separate family and society completely. Similarly, family finances are constantly influenced by social economics. In the current extraordinary times and environment, the impact of social economics on family finances is particularly evident. Family budgets are constantly disrupted by soaring prices and skyrocketing rents. In order to survive, people must desperately seek adjustments to family finances. This situation is especially acute among those who live on meager salaries. They have no permanent assets, no guarantees. Those with weaker wills take their income and gamble it all, and the outcome is naturally failure. Therefore, in order to adjust family finances, the first step is to improve the social economy, such as curbing prices and stabilizing rents. In addition, the following points may be helpful for regulating family finances:</p>
<p>(1) Cooperatives: Joining a cooperative is very beneficial for family finances. Many organizations in this city have fraternities. Some of these organizations have affiliated cooperatives. Each person contributes one or two yuan to become a shareholder and regularly enjoys the benefits of group purchases of rice, coal, and daily necessities. At the end of the year, dividends can also be distributed, which can make up for the lack of individual financial resources. (If there are no such organizations in your unit, please establish them quickly, initiated by the leaders of your unit or organized by the employees themselves!)</p>
<p>(2) Exchanging Goods: I remember that a women's group in this city once had such an organization. They exchanged what they didn't need for what others didn't need, killing two birds with one stone and very convenient. This can also be achieved through industry fraternities, which can be very helpful for family finances.</p>
<p>(3) Production: Currently, if you only reduce spending without increasing income, family finances will only become tighter and life will only become more difficult. But increasing income is really not easy! The most legitimate ways are: writing articles, taking on extra copying work, becoming a night school teacher, etc. In addition to the above occupations (or if they are unable to take on the above occupations), women can weave some handmade products for others. Recently, a group of people, seeing the growing demand for Chinese handicrafts in the United States, advertised for skilled and unskilled female workers. The advantage is that they can take the weaving home to do, which does not interfere with routine housework. The wage for each pair is at least five or six jiao, and up to one or two yuan. Weaving one pair a day can be quite substantial in a month.</p>
<p>(4) Entertainment: Although, within possible limits, it is still necessary to seek physical and mental pleasure. To seek physical and mental pleasure, nothing is better than reading. It can cultivate the temperament and increase intelligence. The Xinya Library on the third floor of the Cishu Building allows you to borrow books for free for a long time by paying a security deposit of one or two yuan. (If you don't borrow, the security deposit can be requested to be returned at any time.) It is very suitable for saving money. As for the children, they can be taken to a nearby children's park on Sundays, which allows the adults to relieve the fatigue of the week without spending a penny!</p>

<h3>Suppressing Material Enjoyment</h3>
<p>— Yu Chayun</p>
<p>The prosperity or decline of family finances is certainly based on the prosperity or decline of social economics and the balance of supply and demand of goods. However, the economic management of a family should have considerable autonomy because material enjoyment in life is compressible. However, in Shanghai today, especially among the lower and middle classes, the economic control of every family can be said to be entirely in the hands of a few wealthy people. In short, our lives are controlled by hoarders and market manipulators of daily necessities.</p>
<p>Under this social reality, we certainly cannot sit idly and wait for death. We must struggle and seek a livelihood. Although the methods vary from family to family, the main methods are nothing more than: in terms of spirit, sticking together through thick and thin (family members); in terms of enjoyment, cutting from the surplus and supplementing the deficit to balance the difference between income and expenditure. However, these two methods are easier said than done. The former requires understanding, and the latter requires considerable time to cultivate. If you only talk about saving when prices are high, then the anxiety and distress of "digging a well when thirsty" will be difficult to endure. Because I started saving two years ago, I don't feel much pain in the current difficult environment, even though I only have an income of fifty yuan to support a family of four. This is not because of my far-sightedness, but because of the stimulation of the objective environment. Many of my relatives and friends were unemployed or on leave of absence after August 13th. They still had to eat unnecessary food and wear unnecessary clothes in their daily lives, and at the same time, their hearts were filled with unnecessary worries! This is what is called "pretending to be fat by swelling your face." Therefore, I constantly asked myself: What if I lost my job?</p>
<p>Therefore, since then, I have been planning ahead and practicing "training my appetite," reducing the number of meat dishes from three to two and the number of vegetable dishes from three to two, and then reducing it to one meat dish and two vegetable dishes after three months. From last summer to now, it has been one vegetable dish. At first, it was very uncomfortable, but I gradually got used to it. Therefore, now that everything is expensive, the impact on me is indeed limited.</p>
<p>Now that rice, coal, oil, etc. are expensive, my income of fifty yuan (plus a temporary subsidy of eight yuan) is still enough to cope. Each month, in addition to the rent of ten yuan, the remaining forty-eight yuan is allocated as follows: half a dan of rice twenty yuan, coal briquettes about eighty city catties four yuan eight jiao (seal the furnace opening with coal dross and water when the midday meal is finished), four catties of oil four yuan, one vegetable dish a day one jiao, a total of three yuan, children's tuition five yuan, other expenses such as soap and matches another three yuan, leaving more than eight yuan for shoes, socks, and socializing.</p>
<p>This is still the actual situation of current price expenditures. Several months ago, when prices were not so expensive, I was living like this, and the savings I had accumulated have not been touched. From now on, I will certainly continue to practice eating hardships. In view of the results of past savings, I now want to save more to avoid future pain. I will not only not make new clothes, but in the future, I also want to mix some yams and taro into the rice to reduce the consumption of rice. As for movies, cigarettes, playing cards, hiring maids, eating snacks, perming hair, cosmetics, and all other unconscious consumption, I will certainly maintain the plan from two years ago and completely abstain.</p>

<h3>Common Sense of Family Economics: Waste Utilization</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>In recent months, social life in Shanghai has been elevated two or three times, or even seven or eight times beyond the standard, due to the endless rise in prices, causing the production and consumption of the majority of citizens to be very far apart. In this difficult environment, in order to balance the difference between income and expenditure, in addition to hoping that the authorities will curb the abnormally rising prices, we can only fully utilize time (that is, manpower) and waste to resist its threat and stabilize family finances.</p>
<p>Currently, the most threatening thing to us is rice and coal. Regarding coal, we can use garbage to reduce the consumption of coal briquettes. The method is to store the garbage swept up every day in an old jar. When there is a considerable amount, remove the soil from it, soak the combustible residue with water, mix in a little coal dross (which can be left over from the place where coal briquettes are piled), stir evenly, make it into a coal briquette shape, and expose it to sunlight. After it dries, it can be used. Each furnace of coal briquettes can be configured with four-tenths (that is, six real coal briquettes and four garbage coal briquettes) to burn together, and the firepower will not be weakened.</p>
<p>Secondly, the peels and roots peeled from vegetables can also be used, don't throw them away. After washing them with water, cut them into granules and cook them with rice. After becoming rice, eating it can not only reduce the consumption of rice, but also has a fragrant aroma, and often has sufficient life elements for the body to absorb. After using towels for a long time, the broken places must be in the center, while the four sides and both ends are intact. You can cut them open from the middle, divide them into two sections, sew the two ends together with warp threads, change the center to the two ends, and change the two ends to the center. Then trim the broken part, and it is another good towel, but it is only shortened in length. Even if it is not used to wash the face, it can also be used to wash dishes, wipe tables, and wipe glass. Toothbrushes and peach pits that are broken to the point where they cannot be used again can be used as tools for wiping leather shoes. Biscuit tins can be made into coal briquette stoves. When clothes are broken to the point where they cannot be worn, the intact parts can be disassembled, disinfected with boiling water, and made into face towels or children's bibs. In short, there is no waste in the family. Every item has two or three uses, it only depends on whether people are willing to use it and me. If we save everywhere and utilize everything, it will not only benefit family finances, but also have the effect of indirectly assisting the authorities in curbing prices.</p>
<h3>A Gain in Saving</h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>There are many ways to save money. The author has thought of two:</p>
<p>(1) According to economics, the measurement of the utility of things is divided into value and price. For example, porridge can relieve hunger, which is its permanent and unchanging value. If there are many monks and little porridge, its "price" will be expensive; conversely, if there is a lot of porridge and few monks, its "price" will be cheap. In other words, the price changes according to the law of supply and demand, but the value does not. Because we are concerned about price, we can take advantage of this point. To give an example: recently, yellow croakers have just come on the market, and the price is of course expensive. We will wait until yellow croakers come in large quantities before eating them. The nutrition is the same, but the price is much cheaper. When the yellow croakers gradually decrease later, the price will gradually increase again. We can use the pickled cheap yellow croakers to take care of them, although the taste is a little worse. This is the meaning of "pickling" in economics. Similarly, the most abundant Chinese mitten crabs in autumn can be made into drunken crabs in winter, the most abundant Chinese cabbage in winter can be made into pickled vegetables in spring, or it can be made into the dried mustard greens made by people in Shaoxing. It is a matter of lifting a hand and saving a lot of money.</p>
<p>(2) Don't throw away things that are still useful. These things are usually called "waste," but they still have some use, so we don't use the word "waste" here. For example, food cans can be sold to junk collectors if you don't want to keep them, which is also worth a few cents; or they can be used as containers for storing small foods. Also, garbage that is considered completely useless can be fermented to generate biogas for lighting, but this requires setting it up. Also, during the New Year, almost every family eats some peanuts and melon seeds. The shells of this kind of snack can be used as fuel. There is an old saying: "A doctor does not discard even cow urine and horse manure." You should always pay attention to the so-called "waste utilization."</p>
<h3>"Wartime Bread"</h3>
<p>— Chuan</p>
<p>Looking with open eyes, the current difficult living conditions in Shanghai are actually common historical facts. The only difference is that in various countries, there is no rampant yellow-belly among manipulators and speculators like in Shanghai. During the last war, at the beginning of the war, the Allied countries rumored that Germany was about to experience a food panic. However, because of Germany's strict control of food, the people did not suffer from hunger in a short period of time as the Allied countries imagined. After the start of the war, Germany established price limits and bread regulations. Thus, there was the so-called "wartime bread" regulation, which restricted all bakers from adding rye flour below a certain percentage when making white flour bread, and from adding sweet potato flour below a certain percentage when making rye flour bread. This kind of bread was eaten by common people, the German Emperor and Empress at the time, and the Crown Prince at the front. Germany's food supply felt insufficient at the beginning of the war due to the Allied countries' naval blockade, but the reason why it was able to support for ten years was because the government had effective control and the people saved in terms of food. Under the current special circumstances in Shanghai, government control is of course beyond its power. Shanghai citizens should use collective strength to sanction speculators in order to improve personal economics. At the same time, those few writing classes should also save material resources and contribute them to the country.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on Clothing Handling</h3>
<p>— Ms. Jin Juqing</p>
<p>For housewives living in the city, there are many things to pay attention to in terms of daily measures, whether at home or out, in terms of economics and other rationalization. Regarding the item of clothing, the author has a few items based on personal experience, or what she usually gets from talking with relatives and friends:</p>
<p>1. Woolen clothes should not be worn close to the body, because woolen things are often washed and easily shrink, not washing is not hygienic, and the animal category of fiber is easy to make the skin itchy.</p>
<p>2. For clothes with linings, it is best to use real silk. If the lining of old clothes is real silk, do not discard it. If you use two layers of old lining, slightly nail them straight with thread and put them inside the new lining to form a three-layer lining garment, which can resist the warmth of thin cotton clothes, and is light and close-fitting.</p>
<p>3. Clothes and socks should be washed frequently. Underwear and socks are best changed every day. You don't need to use much force when washing, and you can also save soap. Night clothes should be made of cotton cloth and must be loose. Old clothes are also acceptable. Do not wear socks when sleeping. If so, the clothes and socks will always be new and durable, and hygienic.</p>
<p>4. After washing clothes and scarves, they should be dried in the sun and ironed with an iron. This is not only related to beauty, but also heat can kill bacteria. It is most inappropriate to stick a washed scarf on a glass window or tile. Cotton clothes and cotton quilts must also be often dried in the sun.</p>
<p>5. When laying the bed in winter, first lay five or six old newspapers on the reed bed (the Shen Bao paper is good and not easy to break), and then lay the mattress on top. The paper is a non-heat-transmitting and windproof material, and can protect the mattress from rubbing against the reed bed.</p>
<p>Conditions for Buying Light Bulbs</p>
<p>Light bulbs are something used in every household. But light bulbs are used to generate electricity, so whether the light bulb can save electricity is very worthy of our attention. Many people think that to save money, you only need to buy cheap light bulbs. In fact, each light bulb should emit full brightness. For example, a 25-watt light bulb should emit 25 watts of light. If it can only emit 20 watts of light, then the electricity bill for 5 watts is wasted. If a 15-watt light bulb uses 30 watts of electricity to emit 25 watts of light, it will cost 5 watts more in electricity bills. Therefore, many self-righteous people think that buying a few cheap light bulbs is saving a lot of money, but in fact they are losing a lot of money invisibly. Therefore, to seek true economy, when using light bulbs, you must not only calculate the price of the light bulb.</p>
<h3>Wartime Commodity Controls</h3>
<p>— Huan</p>
<p>(1) Hong Kong's Price Controls</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Even a clever woman cannot cook without rice." Therefore, at this time when rice is as precious as pearls and firewood as cinnamon, in addition to everyone and every family practicing thrift, there must also be a responsible authority to strictly implement control. Otherwise, no matter how economical, it is impossible to get through this difficult time.</p>
<p>Although there are so-called "price limits" in Shanghai, unscrupulous merchants are outwardly compliant but inwardly resistant, and there are no practical results. As for the organization of control agencies, there is none at all. Recently, I heard that the French Concession is organizing a committee to suppress prices, which is good news for the citizens. We are "on tiptoe hoping for it."</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, the ordinance on controlling commodity prices was promulgated after the outbreak of the European War, so the phenomenon of commodity prices soaring into the sky has not occurred to this day. For example, recently, White Pagoda oil is sold for one yuan and three jiao per pound, fourteen ounces of Condensed Milk five jiao per can, Lutu Fine Milk Powder one yuan one jiao and nine cents per pound, and California Shata fish three jiao and seven cents per can. Other rice and necessary items are even less likely to be hoarded for speculation. Therefore, we very much hope that the Shanghai authorities will quickly establish this kind of control agency.</p>
<p>(2) Food Restrictions in England During the Last European War</p>
<p>During World War I, England followed nutritional principles. Within the scope of not harming health, the weekly food for adults, in addition to eating 12 ounces of grains, 2 pounds of meat, 10 ounces of fatty substances such as butter, vegetable oil, and lard, and 8 ounces of sugar, the weight of bread was as follows:</p>
<p>Men doing heavy work: 8 pounds</p>
<p>Men doing ordinary industrial work: 7 pounds</p>
<p>Men doing desk work: 4 pounds and 8 ounces</p>
<p>Women doing heavy work: 5 pounds</p>
<p>Women doing ordinary work: 4 pounds</p>
<p>Women doing desk work: 3 pounds and 8 ounces</p>
<h3>A Budget Survey of a Salaried Worker</h3>
<p>— Li Shi</p>
<p>The following table lists the results obtained by sorting out the household accounts of the author — a salaried worker — over the past five years. The figures in the table are the percentage distribution of the average monthly actual expenditures for various living expenses each year, and the actual numbers are not listed. Because the purpose of this article is to provide a budget distribution ratio for the family living expenses of a salaried worker, and then analyze the changes in their living standards. Since this report is investigative in nature, listing the actual numbers seems meaningless.</p>
<p>Percentage Distribution of Average Monthly Expenditures for Various Living Expenses</p>
<p>The living expenses listed in the above table are divided into five categories: food, clothing, rent, fuel, and miscellaneous items, according to the research practices of living expenses in various countries at the beginning of accounting. The rent includes lighting and water, which is mostly the case for those who rent houses in Shanghai. Fuel is used for heating and cooking. Miscellaneous items are further divided into subscriptions, books, adding furniture, medical and health care, socializing and entertainment, and other miscellaneous expenses such as maid's wages and special expenses such as travel expenses or loans. This item is determined according to the actual budget of the author's family, and there is no fixed standard. It should also be stated that there has been no increase or decrease in the author's salary during these five years.</p>
