<p>社評</p>
<h3>德國進兵北歐的剖視</h3>
<p>羅斯福總統曾經說過：侵略和疫癘一般，傳染最速。自從一九三一年東三省事變起，主權國領士被人用暴力侵佔的，可說已層出不窮；單就歐洲來講，在過去短短的兩年中，地圖完全變色的，有奧地利，阿爾巴尼亞，捷克，波蘭四國，其他喪地辱國的，有波羅的海沿岸三小國和最近忍痛停戰的芬蘭；誰知在一九四〇年四月九日的淸晨，北歐方面謹愼小心，以嚴守中立爲國策的丹麥挪威，也在「加以保護」之美名下，成爲第三或第四批的被侵略國了。</p>
<p>本來，自從西歐戰事發作之後，歐洲大陸所蘊伏着的許多火藥庫，好像沒有一處不在準備爆炸，沒有人能肯定的說何處先發作，但是幾乎人人都覺得和平如果不能迅速成立，戰禍必定還要繼續擴大。譬如在過去半年中，不但西歐的比利時荷蘭，警報頻傳，至少有三四次之多，卽束南歐的羅馬尼亞匈牙利南斯拉夫諸國，也無時不在危疑震盪之中，甚至連近東各國都有枕席難安之感。在芬蘇媾和之後，一般人所擔心的，母寗說還是偏於巴爾幹方面，因爲就軍略觀點而論，德國倘向該方面活動，至少英法聯軍的干涉，不能來得很快，因此也就不易發生實效，那時，德國不是又將費少數的力量，穩得許多實益嗎？可是，事實却適得其反，德國侵略者的觸鬚，不向東，而向北，不用其「獨步歐陸的機械化部隊，衝入壤士相接的匈牙利或羅馬尼亞，却派出其自知不敵的海軍，以奪取易爲英法聯軍襲擊的斯坎蒂那維亞半島，這不能說不是出人意外的事。</p>
<p>當然，希特勒的一舉一動，都是經過精密計算的，他之所以不向巴爾幹方面謀發展，自有很重要的理由在。照一般人的解釋，這種暫時維持巴爾幹現狀的做法，似乎正是德義蘇三國利害矛盾的結果；原因是德國現在旣不敢再失掉義蘇兩個友邦，因此也就不願直接去觸犯這兩國的利益；所以經過勃倫納山隘的談話，和莫斯科柏林問之接洽，德國寗願暫時捨棄東南歐洲，而移師北指。</p>
<p>不過，吾們以客觀的立塲來批評德國的舉動，總覺得他的侵略北歐，失之「不智」。當然，希特勒希望一舉而佔領丹麥挪威兩國，俾一方面可以通暢北歐物資的接濟，打破英法的封餓，一方面更可以利用丹挪兩國的海空根據地，以直接威脅加諸英法，從而動搖同盟國的自信心。但是，在吾們看來，這兩層似乎不一定能如願以償。</p>
<p>第一，英法兩國一向是以尊重各小國的中立爲國策的，最近因爲德國一再濫用北歐各中立國的領海，本已決定加緊封鎖，此際丹挪兩國旣被德國所侵犯，英法聯軍匪特不必再顧慮北歐的中立，反而可以藉口德國的軍事行動，而派兵爲丹挪兩國收復失地。如此，加緊封鎖北歐海面當然更屬義不容辭，那時德國的北歐航錢恐怕反要完全切斷，甚至連利用挪威政府來向英法提抗議的機會都沒有了，所謂通暢北歐接濟的希望，不是將要等於徒託空言嗎？</p>
<p>第二，德國軍事行動，的確算得敏捷有效，能在二十四小時之內，控制丹麥全境，並派兵在挪威多數港口登陸，真哦勢如破竹之氣概。但是，率直言之，這種乘人不備的攻略戰，德國能之，英法也未嘗不能。據最後消息，德國雖已在挪威沿海，佔領港口多處，但英法兩國的海空軍，正聯合挪威國防軍協力反攻。目下勝負誰屬，固在未定之天，不過根據若干報道，英法聯軍似乎有切實封鎖北歐海面之決心，務使德國無法再以援軍派往挪威前錢；這層如果辦到，那麽前天一日間在挪威登陸的少數德軍，豈非成了孤立無援？德國如果不能趕速從瑞典或其他方面打通一條接濟路綫，這批孤軍豈不消滅在卽？在這種情形之下，德國非但不能以直接威脅加諾英法，恐反面中了聯軍方面「誘敵出擊，聚而殲之」的策略，這不是很不智嗎？</p>
<p>但是也有人說：德國這種舉動，其本質上並不如是簡單：或者這是一種聲東擊西的戰略，他名爲北進，實在還是要西攻或東取，再不然，他或者已和蘇聯義大利甚至日本另有默契，準備造成一種更紊亂的局勢，以便大家在混水中摸魚。這些揣測之詞，固然不無可能，但在未有實證之前，吾們實無理由信以爲眞。嚴格地講，吾們母寗覺得德國這次舉動，有點鋌而走險的意味，正和遠東的侵略者－日本－一樣，彷彿有點東奔西突，急於覓取小勝，以欺朦國民，不擇手段，企圖造成恐怖局面，以恫嚇全人類的意味！這種無理性的舉動，等於作繭自縛，等於自掘墳墓！別的不必講，單以道義兩字而論，這種毫無理由强佔小國領土的行爲，不將在整個文明世界方面引起更大的反感嗎？</p>
<p>羅斯福總統說：侵略是疫癘：吾們不妨再補充一句說：侵略本身是含有毒素的，不但足以毒害人家，卽在侵略者自身，也有一天要中毒的。中毒的結果，便是喪失理智一味蠻幹，便是逐漸失去控制自己的力量，也便是自甘墜入泥淖，以至於無法自拔。這一點道理，實在是全世界侵略國所應該拿來深切反省的，如果還是執迷不悟，那麽，雖聰明機警如希特勒，恐怕也不免要有自食其果的一天，其他自槍而下者，那就更不必說了。</p>

<p>倫敦　下議院頃於本日開會、聽取邱吉爾海相之演說、外交團方面蒞塲旁聽者、計有阿根廷·巴西·美國·比利時·蘇聯·中國　西班牙　波蘭·荷蘭·各國大使、瑞典·南斯拉夫·芬蘭·拉特維亞各國公使、暨挪威國公使館一等秘書、赤道國暨玻利維亞兩國代辦、邱吉爾海相係於午後三時四十八分開始發言、略謂吾人幷未克復挪威國各淪陷港口、但已佔領丹麥國所屬之法洛斯羣島（係在冰島與英國之間）一俟丹麥國恢復自由、吾人即當以之歸還該國云、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　今日下院因海相邱吉爾發表言論到塲人數甚爲擁擠、開始時之若干問話被談話聲浪所擾、幾不可聞於此可見每逢重大情事發生、全院皆急欲獲知當日之確情也」、邱氏於起立發言時、衆皆歡呼以迎之、邱氏發言之初、即聲明渠於報吿事實時、或陳述詳情時、不免或有小錯誤、想諸議員必能予以原諒云、</p>
<p>德軍攻入丹挪　處心積慮已久邱氏曰、已往數星期中之緊張與不自然之恬靜、已於星期一日之晨遭猛烈之打破矣、蓋德軍於是晨突然攻入挪戚丹麥兩國也、此一罪行、當然處心積慮、縝密凖備、爲日已久、不過候至三月之最後一週始發動而已、吾人之接得情報、謂巨　德商船正在改爲運兵船、另有無數小船　泊波羅的海各港與愛爾白河河口、已數月於茲矣、但無人能言其將於何時用之、或將用以壓迫何一和平之國家　丹麥挪威瑞典三國似皆有無端突受野蠻的攻擊之虞、三國中將擇　一國爲　　犧牲品、第一打擊將於何時發作、此不免仍爲純粹猜測之事件、納粹政府慣於山共所有之各途徑不斷傳播種種威　與　言、而悉假手其駐各中立國人員、其各公　館　大使館之　鈴、（衆發笑）共在任何處可覓得之同情者與贊助者爲之、（歡呼與笑聲並作）余敢向全　保證、　言非特指任何人物者、凡此諸國、悉受威　、德政府旣不受法律之約束、復無良心上之躊躇、其政府中人顯皆主張擇弱而擊、　置强者於後、故與其毘運之各小國皆已陷於高度之恐慌中、今則仍如是也、甚至竭力向德國表示好感、並予以最大援助之各中立國、亦不能保證德人不毫無理由而突施攻擊、迅即顚覆具國家、並刦奪其所有之財產、故此項不幸之國家、皆惴惴不安、不知此後輪及者、將屬誰何、吾人現知星期一日之侵晨、挪威與丹麥兩國已抽得此項兇惡彩劵之不幸號碼、丹麥有種種特殊之理由可資危懼、不但因其爲德國最近及最弱小之隣國、且以其最近曾與德國訂約、保證其不受任何之煩擾、（衆大笑）、丹麥與英德兩國、皆從事積極之商業、此項貿易在戰時之繼續、早在德國預料之中、並由德丹兩政府商定特別貿易辦法以保證之、此舉顯然置丹麥於特殊危險之地位、</p>
<p>封鎖德國障礙　莫過挪威走廊</p>
<p>挪威西海岸之特殊形狀、成爲一種走廊或捷徑、使中立國之貿易以及德國各種船艦、得在挪威及瑞典之領海中、來往通過協約國之封鎖、此種地理的及合法的掩護途徑之存在、已使吾感受最大之不利、而予德方破壞協約國封鎖之努力以絕大之利益、德軍艦任意來往、德潛艇加以利用、德國郵船商輪之企圖由外海駛回德國者、亦皆遵循此長八百餘哩之路綫、封銷德國之最大陣礙、莫過於此挪威走廊、上次大戰如此　目前之戰事亦正如此、</p>
<p>英海軍曾被迫坐視德國及中立船喪、源源裝運各種違禁品赴德、本可隨時加以阻止、但因有國際公法條款之存在不願加以破壞、而德國則在此次。事中竭盡蔑視公法之能事、一如上次大戰中之行徑、</p>
<p>當上次大戰之中、吾人與美國聯合時、協約國因德潛艇利用該掩護之路以爲施其盜行之出發點、深受損害、故英法美三國政府會同商請挪威政府在其路此掩護的水路之領海中敷設水雷、以阻德潛艇之僭用該路以行暴、</p>
<p>自此次戰事爆發後、海軍部當然須將此現代甚受尊重之前例提吿英政府、請其注意及之、並促請應許吾人自行在挪威海面敷設水雷、以迫令經此出入德國之船隻悉駛行於公海、俾有合受遠禁品統制之機會、或由封鎖艦隊加以拘捕、以爲戰　品、但政府甚至對此技術上的違反國際公法之舉動、亦極端猶豫懼招物議、此爲理所當然而正當者、吾入乃圖依守國際公法以行事、未幾逐漸感覺若任此航路交通繼續不已、協約國將受累無窮、且逐週目覩船隻沿此走廊滿載鐵砂開往德國、而用以製成子彈、以斃一九四一年戰爭中之英法靑年、實令人忍無可忍、故卒乃決定、良心上之不安固已使吾人受有損害、同時亦可爲吾人博得光榮、乃遮斷此路之交通、而使各船隻咸須經行公海焉、英政府乃於星期一日拂曉宣布敷設水雷區、一面作種種戒防、勿使中立國之船隻或生命因此微受危險、甚至顧及敵方之船隻、</p>
<p>納粹政府　圖以吾人封鎖挪威定廊爲其攻人挪丹兩國之藉口、但吾人無疑的不特能證明德方之準備已遠在約一月之前、且能證明其軍隊與艦船之實在動作、已在英法敷設水雷之前開始矣、德人顯猶猜料吾人將從事敷設水雷、而決不料敷設之適在目前也、故德人乃在三月之最後一週決議利用挪威走廊、遣派載鐵砂回國之空船滿載軍需、而以德兵伏於其下、以便號令一發、即佔據挪威沿海有軍事　値之各口岸、一面並出</p>
<p>準備已久之攻軍、以打擊曾以種種方法援助彼等之二無辜中立國、吾人對挪威之人民表示深切之同情、（衆歡呼吾人聞挪威現已陷於慘烈之進退維谷中、挪威人之情緒如其他又各小國　　傾向協約國、彼等在無望之忿怒忍受痛苦、蓋其船隻數十艘已被擊沉、多數之水手已遭滅頂也、</p>
<p>彼　充分認識其將來之獨立與自由、與協約國之勝利有連帶關係、彼　直至最後一刻尙希望彼等之土地及城市、不受德軍之蹂躪、彼等之自　與生活勿爲外國　虛者所掠奪、但此種希望終成畫餅、納粹德國已對一弱小之友邦橫施暴行、挪威政府及人民、今日已執槍而　衛其家國矣、（衆歡呼）</p>
<p>恢復挪人自由　始能談到和平　吾人將出全力以援助之、（衆歡呼）、吾人將與之共同作戰、唯有恢復彼等之權利與自山、始能談到和平、（衆歡呼）、挪威廣大荒野之多山區域中到處皆有據點、可供自由人民隱蔽作戰之用、對於欲征那彼等之暴害者、將可維持長期猛烈之抵抗、挪威之遭遇、實可爲其他中立國家、妄思與德國友邦或受德國之保證、或與德國訂有任何種類條約、將可稍予彼等以保護而不致遭受侵略者前車之鑒、因德國一旦有利可圖、即將翻面無情也、如挪威政府前未嚴格厲行其中立以施不利於吾人、及聽令其走廊供德國利用而施其陰謀、如挪威政府早與吾人成立彼此信任之關係、則吾人儘有餘　予以援助、而較今日便利多多矣、倘使此項中立國在確實迪受德國有計畫的攻擊之前、拒協約國於千里之外、則此時有人譴責協約國不予以實際上之援助及保護、殊欠公尤、渠信挪威今日之遭遇、實以嚴守中立爲其主要之原因、</p>
<p>邱氏續稱、渠信目前必有若干方面發出海軍作何行動之問題、渠願竭力說明過去及現在之情形、但對於未來及現時正在進行中之行動、則恕難發表、約在五星期之前國內艦隊、駛返斯加巴灣休息、並由該處出發、從事活動、吾人連續遭遇空襲警報、　及多次空襲、但吾人目前已有極猛烈之高射砲位、與其他防禦方法同時動作、並與王家空軍及海軍航空隊、商妥極佳之辦法、俾在遙遠之距離中有充分之飛機隊、可資調遣、在德機第一次空襲之中、巡洋艦一艘船尾中彈、需要數星期之修理、除此以外、則截至此時發言時爲止、斯加巴灣中、並無一艦被擊中或損毀、岸上亦無稍具軍事重要之目標被德機投中、受傷者爲數極微、據　之目光、敵方對於攻擊斯加巴灣、已漸懼砲火之威脅、此種情形實無足驚奇、因岸上各砲台輔以艦隊强有力之砲位、實可謂全世界中最猛烈之集中高射砲火云、</p>
<p>倘使此項中立國在確實遭受德國有計畫的攻擊之前、拒協約國於千里之外、則此時有人譴責協約國不予以實際上之援助及保護、殊欠公尤、渠信挪威今日之遭遇、實以嚴守中立爲其主要之原因、（未完）</p>

<p>租界現狀無可變更</p>
<p>記者以此次選舉、萬一英美聯合陣綫為日方所敗、則此後租界行政之管理權、將被日方攫奪或控制、租界現狀必有變更、深以為慮、曾於昨日趨訪租界中最有權成之某氏、叩詢其意見、據稱、在競選中、日方要求增加候選人至五名、因有長　間之醖釀、及充份之準備利用具單事政治之</p>
<p>特殊勢力　處心積慮、其實力誠不可輕忽、但　萬一英美聯合陣綫為日方所敗、則此後租界行政之管理、將被日方攫等或控制、租界現狀必有變更、情雖可慮、事有未然、即以日方候選人完全當選論、九名西董中去其五人則英美尙佔有四人、合之</p>
<p>華董五人　共為九人、以九對五、以中美英三國聯全陣綫對付此五席日董、日方固　必佔優勢、一切行政管理之設施、自仍當取決於此多數、日方根本亦無法　縱、談至此、記者則詢某氏曰、設日方利用種種詭謀　、於此次</p>
<p>競選揭曉　後、設法破壞比五華董之　任、或提出列入　員苦干人、則此三國聯合陣綫、不將被擊破乎、某氏以鄭重而堅決之態度秴曰、全市數百萬中國市民、業已宣告中外、彼等已決意擁護上屆五華董　任矣、若有任何人反對或破壞、無異對數百萬租界</p>

<h3>對日軍排斥第三國權益　馬歇爾警闢言論　藉口軍事實行壟斷一切　但此種措置必自食其果</h3>

<p>行不顧言　目前在「卓亞新歐序」口號上所採用之政策、適與門戶開放及機會均等諸原則相反、吾人難以設想此種政策、對於華人及外商發生如何重大之影響、日軍所謂因軍事關係、難以開放長江珠江之商務、此實係欺世之談、據目前調查所得、一切商埠及長江珠江之開放問題、絕非碍於軍事關係、而實為日人不尤外人重建或恢復各該區域之舊狀而已、目前上海華人所遭受之痛苦、及因種種日常用品不能源源運滬、造成物價飛漲、不勝擔負之情形、其起因如謂由於軍事關係、吾人員難加以容忍、其癓結所在、實完全由於日軍採取種種限制、重重捐棁所致也、</p>
<p>自食其果　但敢斷言者、日軍此種措置、將來必自食其果、蓋在此種情形下欲使日之佔領區內逐漸繁榮、實已喪失其可能、日軍屢言願尊重外人在華權益、但天津·烟台·靑島·漢口·等地之情形、適足證明人毫未實行其諾言之萬一、天津租界目前尚在封鎖狀態中、靑島英輪運輸、受極大之限制及打擊、在華北「反英運動」之氣焰有漲無減、但當此之際、日方輪隻、幾已壟斷各地所有之客貨運輸、尤其對於內河航運、業已完全操於日人掌握之中、以上海情形而論、自中日戰事爆發、外輪所能停泊之碼頭、幾全部在日軍勢力範圍內、此種損失、目前實難以計算</p>
<p>對華意見　此外、馬氏又就中國西南合作事業發表其意見、渠認為目的之中國、其所需要之物產、實可自足自給、運輸困難、雖不能免、但如設立小型之工廠、則運輸問題不致嚴重、渠又認為甚至在和平實現之後、此種工廠亦仍及中國之軍事狀態時、驪氏認為目前日軍已處困境、蓋日方雖表面佔領極大之地區、但因游擊隊之活躍、彼等所能統治者、面積實極渺小、</p>

<p>烚赤仍起不定</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開滙兌報長、美滙吿鬆、是以人心轉疲、賣者頗多、一開　猛撳六十五元、金號出銀號一十兩、爲五千五百九十元、嗣有某證券帮與錢兌業首肯撈入、回起二十五元、證券帮進現金號三十兩、爲五千六百十五元、但此時美滙續報硬化、賣風再起、某證券帮反進爲出、同時銀樓帮亦有塞出、又降落三十元、銀號出證券帮十兩、遜至五千五白八十五元、此後外電突傳歐洲戰事加劇、並說比利時已在總動員、故滙市急吿轉緊、一時買風陡起、某證券帮復來猛吸、金號曁銀號帮亦來競買、且斯時售者頗少、遂飛漲一百十元、證券帮進金號二十兩、爲五千六百九十五元、旋乃外滙轉定、買者漸少、　利浮多頓乘高脫手、回小三十五元、金號互做五十兩、爲五千六百六十元、後某錢兌業忽來拖人、重父拉起八元、錢兌業進銀號三十兩、為五千六百六十元作午收價、午後初開堅俏、　開即抬二十二元、金號進證券帮五十兩、爲五千六百九十元、少頃銀號買進、再高十五元、銀號吸收銀樓帮三十兩、爲五千七百零五元、嗣乃另一銀號吐出、金號亦賣、曾回挫十元、銀號出錢　業二十兩、爲五千六百九十五元、顧以某銀號再來狂拖、斯時外滙略緊、目證券帮吃胃亦佳、復又猛抬三十五元、銀號進金號二十兩、爲五千七百三十元、旋因漲風未免鋒鋩、且外滙回平、引起獲利者出檔、迅速回入五千七百元大關、退至五千六百八十元、後再加外滙突報鬆動、賣者愈多、金號銀號及某錢兌業聯袂賣出、遂繼續回落四十元、錢兌業出銀號一十兩爲五千六百四十元、將近收盤時、金號忽來復進、提起十元、金號互做二十兩、爲五千六百五十元作晚收價、結果比上日軋小五元、全天一百四十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高數元、收進减低二十元、現標金照掛脾金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金亦曲折異常</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸五百七十元、迨至九時三十分掛小五元、十時半回大五元、十一時掛高五元、正午回小五元、午後二時又掛大五元、三時五十分回低五元、結果平平、大同行依然懸五百七十元原價、新同行與上價相同、收進臧低十五元光景、</p>
<h3>四月期美滙　紛紛轉賣</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、滙豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美滙暗市、變化殊多、但範圍尙屬狹隘、蓋環境利多利空、難以捉摸、經營者大都不敢有所作爲、晨初因　美滙兌回畏、達三分三七五、致開後立現英平美鬆〇六二五、未幾沙遜曁投機商不的而同、傾吐四月　　滙、市象遂吿見鬆、且現貨美滙期貨先令無不隨之帶硬、但不久因電傳比利時作軍事準備、人心對歐局憂慮日甚、致引起不少扒戶、如華商華行咸向市購納、且中有英美烟公司結入現美滙有數、時潛勢告緊、直至午刻、因外行供意殊淡、狀仍軟、下午初傳本屆公共租界競　某方或可勝利、外銀行供意突淡、一度帶軟、但不久傳某方機家亦起拋售、逐見後硬、終收市先令仍四便士一二五、與期貨均平、現美金又至六元、軋長〇六二五、遠期均鬆〇九三七五、掉期更見軋攏、交易頗形旺達、</p>
<p>美英匯兌果回長</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠各長四三長五與三七五、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定如故、滙兌英對美滬法等各滙俱平、美對英長三分三七五、對滬大一角、對法大一分八七五、中央掛牌各滙仍舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四便士一二五、美滙六元、較之前收、英平美鬆〇六二五、乃匯兌回升之故同時期貨開出、亦吿英平美鬆〇六二五、開後沙遜　投機商咸來售出四月份美滙、計做開五元九六八七五及六元、市面實已鬆泛、而現貨亦微硬、英金仍爲四便士一二五、美滙時吿六元〇三一二五、惟期貨英金一致跟鬆、本月份價四便士〇七八一二五、五月份三便士九八四三七五、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉加二分有半、此後外電盛傳比利時動員等歐洲不良消息、華商逐即止塞轉進、華行亦起吸收、且英美烟公司尙有現美滙結納、致情勢漸趨軟化、英美烟公司入現貨美滙價爲六尹、華商及華行等成交價四月份美滙計五元九三七五至五元八七五、五月份爲五尤七五、迨至午刻、投機商又扒入華行東亞五月期美滙五元七五、終以外行供意淡薄、市象仍聚、牧盤價現貨英金四便士一二五、美滙五元九六八七五、四月份英金四便士〇六二五、美滙五元八七五、五月份英金三便士九六八七五、美滙五元七一八七五、除現期英金與晨開相同外、美滙則均軟〇三一二五、</p>
<p>下午一度又　緊</p>
<p>後市因傳日僑競選或可勝利、市勢仍現　緊、現美滙五元九六八七五、一度難結、入後忽傳日僑競選結果失敗、某行力塞、及外行有利並投機商均稍有出籠、故卒吿轉鬆、計某行賣與外行現美滙六元、及有利投　商吐予大通等外行本月份美滙五元九〇六二五、又五月份美滙五元七五與七八一二五、迄晚收現　英金　吿四便士一二五、美滙六元、本月份英金四便士〇七八一二五、美滙五元九〇六二五、五月份英金爲三便士九八四三七五、美滙五元七五、較前收現貨英平美硬〇六二五、四五月份期貨英金俱鬆〇一五六二五、美滙　硬〇六　五、</p>

<h3>外幣軟弱</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、猶在激盪不定中、終則均趨低落、英美令鎊於上千需要尙殷、市價殊佾、午後以金價急遽趨下、因亦跟隨下落、英金票勿史、美金票初因鎊價轉漲而跌至十六元六角四分、嗣又高至十六元七角四分、午間復退至十六元六角半、午後初曾高至十六元七角半、迨一點後、關於此次工部局西董競選、對英美有利之消息頻傳、並傳華軍向贛北疾進、距南昌已不遠、故賣氣忽盛、晚市退爲十六元五角五分、香港票跌後稍回、法郞票及安南票趨勢甚軟、新加坡票及荷蘭羅此斐律濱安南等票均趨低落、日金票初尙平穩、繼則趨下、晚市爲　元三角三分、朝鮮票供給驟殷、市價遽爾趨跌、晚市爲元零六分五厘、餘俱不動、</p>
<h3>證券　外股重起活躍　內債起伏不常</h3>
<p>證暗盤、昨因人心不振、　境多故、市價繼續疲軟、　趨勢尙覺緩和、因遽小即有人收買、茲聞南昌戰爭頗屬有利、市價當可稍稍轉蘇、但無鉅大變化、二十號多頭等漸有出籠、此爲乍遇抽籖後應有之現象、三十號等　仍在不斷的吸收、昨日經過、上午丙種曾一度高　五十元、不旋踵即行下　、人心向背於此可　、午後賣氣尤較午前爲甚、各　再行略小、惟多空尙屬相當、故趨勢平穩、結果除丁種尙略好五分外、餘則續小一二角左右、成交總數約計一百萬元譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交寗紹公司股四十股、價爲十、元六角、</p>
<p>衆業股市由於挪戚與瑞典前綫傳來消息良好、股　應極佳、實業股　有進展、趨勢活潑異常、晚收價　爲　日中之最優者、中國懇植股曁上海銀公司之騰達新高峯、爲昨日之二特色、前者交易極夥、一度見二十二元、嗣因獲利了結紛起、反動回落至二十一元、收盤買方重佔優勢、價爲二十一元二五買進、七五賣出、上海銀公司亦甚活躍、收盤二十八元半有買戶、國際揚子曁英聯　股交易隆盛、各以二十五元七五、十七元半及四十二元二　買進收盤、橡皮股甚寗靜、蓋公衆興趣、幾俱集中於實業股也、</p>

<h3>糧食　米市定局　洋米到源不絕</h3>
<p>昨晨米市承前午疲勢、尙在看小、雖原根客販無出售意、但作客觀望、散戶回籠頗多，低落近元、若洋米小絞開三十七元半、內地鄉莊等及銷路復起、復反　爲緊、行情回升元　、一號西貢爲四十三元、火絞四十一尤半四十一元、小絞卅八元半、如此徘徊多久直迄牧市未有變化、結果以收盤行情而　、較之前市雖有增高二三角者、然紙堪稱謂定局而已、糯米自早至午始終平平、厚粳及早稻　國米其來源、昨由虹口轉出者有二千餘包、市面亦乏軒輊、宿紛粳仍爲四十元、斛見早晚稻高四十元、中三十九元半、三十九元、塲外暗盤、聞悉平庸、與前相仿、</p>
<p>洋米繼續運來、昨日太古公司山東輪抵滬、自香港運來八千五百九十六包、又怡和洋行永生輪、於前日（十日）傍晚到埠，亦由香港裝來洋米一千三百八十四包、並有轉往烟臺四百五十四包、轉往天津七千六百二十五包、（祖）、</p>
<p>昨日洋米晨間開市後、因連日行情一再盤漲、實消缺乏、連日熱烈活躍者盡　投機與搶帽子性質、一經價昂獲利、立即趁機出籠、故開市後賣氣極旺、尤以回籠四五月份期二號西貢售出最多、價開四十九元五六角、市面頗呈平正、並不　歐戰擴大與金價高昂而引起大戶之　收、然價平之際突又引起客　與浮戶之問津、又以國外定價不劃、行商手貨絕不吐出、市乃頓時挨步　升、　　買氣尤濃、四五月之西　二號昂至五十元〇二角、成交數亦加至四百　、現洋米初平繼俏、亦大五六角、一號西　又漲至四十二元八角、二號四十元〇三角、其他各米一致上升、全日現米成交亦有七十多包、</p>
<h3>麵紛續堅　麥市無形停頓</h3>
<p>紛　　堅、查　號粉廠盤、站定十三元八角、客盤槪無正市、回籠貨則以連日歐局嚴重、金價昂貴聲中、人心頗堅、惟目下內地粉來滬　銷、亦未免稍受影響、聞老車牌初開十三元四角一分、下午開價十三元四角半、雙獅牌亦已昂至十三元、洋粉客帮略有指染、價爲十三元七八角、統市各粉成交併計續有一萬餘包、</p>
<p>麥以存底單薄、頗有提高之息、而華廠進胃尚有、不願放價收買、所以一跌而不能漲、致雙方各走一端、無形停頓、</p>
<h3>紗花　春銷時期已短　紗市漲勢緩和　雙馬比上年歲幕　已漲起五百餘元</h3>
<p>連朝狂騰之紗市昨則趨勢稍形和緩、但　般心理、仍屬多數看好、所以市盤一低、拖進者甚形踴躍、因之目前市價、被大衆抬住、然查上年年暮、二十支雙馬期貨價爲七　六十三元、至今已漲至一千　百七十四兌、此種漲度、不能說謂不可怕、且春銷時期日見消襄、將後之變化、殊難預　也、紗晨開因英美匯兌轉長、美匯趨鬆、市場人氣略平、二十支雙馬廠單價爲一千二百四十五元、現貨價爲一千二百五十元、旋後人心稍緊、聞某紗上升、又被牽動、廠單至一千二百五十八元、現貨價爲一千二百六十三元、查半日間成交統計二千零四十包、行情二十支雙馬現貨漲三元、十支粗紗跌十躲元、又現紗今（十二日）有二百八十五件、運往　港，又一百六十五件、運廣州灣、又十件、運海口、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>

<h3>美印棉交易　依然起色</h3>

<p>另　外棉市價、紐約棉市、　日　形靜寂、晨初　有　部份之同業購買而略漲、後父因空頭抵補而堅、結果　華爾街股票價格之低落、而棉價未能振作、故收盤價格較之上日漲跌互見、印度棉市昨日因一部份之歐洲商賣出、及多頭獲利了結、　　預　　落　羅比、埃及棉市漲十四五磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、現貨始終俏俐異常、俱　同業之交易、廠方却靜寂殊甚、　來美印棉到貨雖多、然悉係廠方者、日方購買頗見活　、大部係巴西棉、彼等深恐印棉　滬發生困難也、茲將昨日棉市以美匯六元折合送　價如下、</p>

<p>緬甸大勢（二）</p>
<p>緬甸王之持手槊以殺大臣也，有似乎自起　印之天子；其置國事於不問也，有似乎髹漆為樂之君王；其好為淫樂也，有似乎携妃子入景陽宮井之後主。有一於此，猶足亡國，而况緬王萃於一身，有不授人以覬覦之隙者乎。緬甸無險足守，無兵可憑，何恃不恐，而竟恣其橫暴也。夫大臣親臣，國家所倚賴，尊之親之，所謂：「价人維藩，宗子維城，毋俾城壤，毋獨斯畏。」此古今之通義。設使大臣親臣，果有可誅之罪，亦當與眾臣共議其罰，斷無有身為一國之主，而以手自殺人為威者；況緬王不以殺人為立威，而以殺人為取樂，蓋較之紂之播棄黎老，其虐有更甚者矣！西晋以骨肉相殘，啟五胡之亂，北齊以大誅宗室，致繫組之辱，自古以來，凡自剪其枝葉，未有不弱及根本者也。傳云：「本大而末小，是以能固。」緬王又豈全不計及哉。且英國駐緬之使臣，巳力諫數次，而卒不之聽，此其昏蔽為何如者。近時各國和約所通之地，皆有公使駐紮，所以敦盟誓，通聲氣，採風俗，理本國交涉之事，如是而已，諫諍非其職也。今英公使已諫之至再，緬王仍莫之聞。緬廷諸臣，兢兢自保，尚恐不暇，決無有強諫力諍者。緬王這暴戾，決無止境矣。嗚呼！如遇敵國外患，而後知所　警，緬　尚可問哉。</p>

<h3>耶穌和失業者　（二）</h3>
<p>在今天所引證的這個比喻裏，雖則耶穌不曾明說，却包含了這個原則。葡萄園主對站立街上的人說，「你們為何終日站在這裏無所事事呢？」他們回答說，「因為無人雇用。」若是有人雇用他們，他們是不惜工作終日的。耶穌在這裏本是詮釋上帝的公道。世人也應如此，只是不見人實行。世人所行的是等量的原則，即付作少代價，得多少東西。我們的工作，以鍾點，日月，或年計算，我們所得的酬勞亦然。但在上帝的公道中，有比較更有意義的原則，就是第一看人不看工作。凡願工作的人不應缺乏日常食物。人的本分是工作，遊手好閒懶惰不做事的人，我們輕視他。我贊同使徒羅的原則：不做事的人，不應當吃飯。在各級社會裏，有不少的人，當送到特種機關去受訓練，養成他們工作的習慣。身壯力健而不肯做工的人，社會不能維持他們。但願做而却無工作可得的人如何呢？前面說人的本分是做工，那末，進一步我們可以說人應有工作做的權利。不知社會能否如此組織，使每人都得到全時候的工作。這一點我看就是至精密的社會計畫，也不能完全做到，所以，頂好讓人民輪流的休息，只是事先要設法使他能渡過這閒散時期。這是合理的結論，這一層比喻的葡萄園主，就做到了。社會也應有此公道，使忠實工人，在閒散時候，不至于受屈去尋求和接受慈善的施捨，或因閒散過久，變成廢人。事先準備，我看三方面的人都當盡力。第一，工人自己要有自尊心，未雨綢繆：第二，工業家要有遠見，使工人加入準備，俟景氣過去之後，再歡歡喜喜回來工作；第三，是其餘的我們。我們為消費大衆，應注重公道，照顧失業工人，更應有先覺，求得整個社會機構的健全，預防國家人才的荒廢。工人，工業制度，和國家，三方面效力以作失業保險計劃的基礎，這樣，岢以救我們免去將來失業的羞辱和悲那點兒，我們這樣做，就是把上帝的公道，運用到我們社會裏來。所以，為基督的原犬　，我請求諸位贊助這失業保險計劃。（完）</p>

<h3>投機的敎訓</h3>
<p>— 島客</p>
<p>上一回當，學一回乖，經一次挫折，獲一次經騐和敎訓，這次筆者受同事經營投機交易的熏染，不知量力的因羨效輩，斗胆鑽向黑市場中，做買賣美金票的賭博行為。事前明知投機交易，是不正當的，是危險的，但是存僥倖之心，終於嘗試了。</p>
<p>事實是這樣的：有許多金融界朋友對我說：「美滙祇有一天一天的緊縮，決不會放長，說不定會從六元零，縮到五元七角半，或五元半，老兄，不要錯過，做多頭是時候了！……」於是苦思焦慮，多方設法，籌措得做百元美金票的證金法幣兩百元，恭而敬之的，送到黑市場中的證券號裏去，他們替我立就一手摺。代進美金百元，行市是十六元二角五分，照例須繳法幣一千六百廿五元，因為收了客戶的保證金，餘欠代做押款，月息是一分五厘，按日照算。至於代進和代出時的佣金。我依照他們的營業規例，欣然接受。那是三月近杪，轉瞬到了四月一日，美滙果然大縮特縮，從六元一二五，而六元〇九三七五，六元……以至中等，竟敲破六元關，而一變為五元九六八七五……美金票價，從十六元三角，而三角半，……直綫昇到五角七分，六角二分……的高峯。我這時心中暗喜，以為很迅速的已經有了三角七分的好賺頭了，還在痴心妄想，希望從六角六分，能够直昇到十七元，再預備賣出。又誰　　到六角二分的初步高峯，竟　漸地突然下跌！從四角半……一直瀉到二角半，依然誤於美匯必再大縮的主觀，而呆等着一天，兩天，三天，四天，……可是越挺越僵，美金票市面，愈來愈小了。</p>
<p>八日那天，開晨僅做一角，一角半，嗣步退至〇七分，我自己一算成本，（加上十多天的利息以及佣金）啊，喲，不好了！一元美金，計喲，不好了！一元美金，計虧蝕三毛，一百元的美金，不是須要触到三十多元了嗎？再呆等下乖，證金不是快要犧牲一半了嗎？於是忍痛斬割出賣，價僅十六元〇八分，單是美金本身上，須虧蝕十七元，加上佣金五元，和一分半的利息八九元，總計證金內被扣除二十多元，眞使我啞了吃黃連，有苦無說處了。出三十多元，買來經騐和敎訓，這是筆者寫斯文的動機，和自己愧悔的。俗語說：「醬缸裏虫醬缸死！」我切勸沉溺於黑市場的投機朋友！快猛醒吧！</p>
<h3>公共汽車又要加價了</h3>
<p>— 直之</p>
<p>英商公共汽車將於十五日起，再度增加車資了，公司當局所發表的理由是：第一，橡膠車胎等件進貨價值的增加。第二，職工薪給的增加，而使公司開支直接加大。</p>
<p>關於第一點，固屬目下的事實問題，不過我們應當明瞭的公共汽車上各項零件以及車胎等所以貨值價格的激增者，最大原因，還是由於外匯的奇縮所致，然而止下的外匯價值，並不低至最落的時代，而外匯價值變動得最為劇烈，猶在去年署期以後，目下倒反而站定了相當的水準，就是維持在英鎊四辦士，美匯五六元之間。那麼照此情形看來，或者再等待一個極短時間以後，各國進口貨值，就能自然而然地逐漸下降，則對於公司常局今日所持為增加車資的唯一理由者，亦便不至存在。</p>
<p>第二，我們想還未曾忘記的，就是於不久以前，公共汽車公司的鋼匠，司機和賣票員，因為感覺平日待遇的不够維持生活而要求增加津貼一問題，一度宣告罷工過。由此看來，職工薪給的增加，還是最近的事。</p>
<p>且也，我人更就公共汽車事業本身的性質來觀察，原性質以營利為唯一目的者所可比擬，此點我想賢明的英商公共汽車公司當局所必深切明悉的。當此本市民生堪慮，上海居大不易的時會下，公共汽車公司當局的提出增加車資，以重民困，似乎也屬不應有的現象。</p>
<p>再者，姑讓筆者再附為一言的，公共汽車營業的鼎盛時代，乃實為「八一三」滬戰以後，試看一二年來公司因了滬市畸形繁榮的需要，新闢了許多路綫，新添了許多車輛，這是一個大家眼見的事實。</p>
<p>總之，公共汽車公司的增加車資，從各方面研究下來，畢竟是不應有和不合理的舉動，所以，我寄語公司當局，勿僅圖一時的逞利為快，而能顧全整個社會的負担，並於今日嚴重情勢一過之後，亦能跟隨其他的立即減低退落了保全公司今後的事業着想</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第廿二回　新聞要訉天外飛來　崇議宏論人間信仰</p>
<p>何儷玉道：『愛人姊！你總是說出笑話來了。便是唱戲，兩三個人也不能成一班子，何況是一個報館呀！』朱愛人道：『你不知道！那是在戰爭時代，你們在美國，那裏知道有這些事。我說的全部報館資產只有一　，一點也不差。這一擔，而且並非重擔，只是輕擔。那一擔兩頭，一頭是一架無綫電收音機，一頭是一箱油墨印機，再加上些白報紙蠟紙之類，不是兩樣東西，份量都不重嗎？所謂三人合作者，一人管編輯，就是把無綫電收音機收來的重要新聞寫出來，便是你要發議論，也可以做簡短的評論。一人管印刷，他要鋪蠟紙，寫鋼筆，然後在油墨印機上，一張張的印出來。一人管發行，有的分派到各處定閱的地方去，有的貼在牆上，成為壁報。一個報館，重要部份，就是這三項，不是三個人，都負起責任來嗎？而且三個人還可以通力合作。聽無綫電的時候，印刷，發行兩部也許是空的，可以帮助他。印油墨機，寫蠟紙的時候，編輯，發行函部也許是空的。貼牆壁，發關定閱處的時候，編輯，印刷兩部又是空的。不是三人可以互相帮助的嗎？而且還有一件便當之處，這個報館是活動的。不像他們巍巍大厦。建築了七八層高樓，開在上海，只是閉在上海，報紙可以運到別處去。報館是不能　到別處去的。他們却不然，今天高興在這裏，明天不高興，便可以移到別處去。一隻野航船，或是全部報館財產牽裝了就走，再寫意也沒有了。所以天今看了這，規模的報館，我就想到了當初中國辦報的艱難困苦。』吳群素道：『中國古書上說的：放之則彌六合，卷之則退藏於密』，不想新聞事業，也是如此。』邵慧華道：『君素姊又要掉書袋了。你說退藏於密，偏偏我們此地有個人，不肯退藏於密。』大家聽了愕然道：『你說的是誰呀？』邵慧華道：『我說的是我們今天在座的一位新娘子。人家新婚時，叫做蜜月，不大出來的，眞呌做退藏於密。偏偏我們澹雲姊，情願和我們合成六人，眞又是放之六合，不肯退藏於蜜。』君素道：『可惜那蜜是甜蜜之蜜，不是秘密之密。』慧華道：『阿呀！我念了別字了！罰我一杯！』　（二六二）</p>
<h3>平價與漲價</h3>
<p>— 逸鵬</p>
<p>在八分一碗的白飯改善七分，五角一客的飯減售四角的新聞前面，同時看到「煤球竟又漲價」的大標題，我想編輯先生發下這兩條新聞的時候，對這矛盾的現象，總經過一度的懷疑吧？而我們小民呢，這一種突然受到的感應，實在當得「啼笑皆非」四個字。</p>
<p>包飯業及飯店因近日米價下跌而減價，是值得我們感謝的。自從憑了種種藉口而跳起來的價目，從來沒有聽到過會知動減低下來，而因為牟利心重，竟至連「藉口」也沒有而一漲再漲的，已聽得叫人到了「頭痛」的地步了：煤球的一再上漲，也是其中之一。</p>
<p>恕我們從報上讀到的消息之外，不明瞭了「來泊」及「水脚」等等內幕情形，不過，自從春節後煤球矣漲之後，把讀的消息歸納起來。有：熱水業的呼籲；煤球業公會及持有煤球棧單者的相互推諉責任廣告；小型煤球商的致虞洽卿公開信；…等等，從這些新聞與廣告中，至少使人見到了內幕情形的一半。所幸可喜的，是跟着來了一個「平賣」的消息，不過跟着這「平賣」消息的，不能忘了「請求減輕水脚」的呈文，於是再請接上昨報的「又告漲價」，則我們不必明瞭「內幕」情形，也可以瞭如指掌了。</p>
<p>現在的結論是：平價是漲價的伏筆；漲價以平價為衝鋒。</p>

<h3>米蓋羅縕說：　假使沒有愛迪生</h3>
<p>— 靜遠</p>
<p>——世界上就沒有電影</p>
<p>聞名全世界的美國大發明家愛迪生的一生，現在已攝成影片，搬上銀幕了。在好萊塢爭攝傳記片的今日，這張影片的攝製，不可否認地是一個可喜的消息。米高梅的這部著名傳記片，分上下二部，上半部是「少年愛迪生」記述幼年時代愛迪生的種種，由今年的電影皇帝米蓋羅納擔任主角。後半部是「壯年愛迪生」由史賓基厥賽主演，現在前半部「少年愛迪生」已經攝製完竣了。</p>
<p>米蓋羅納最崇拜愛迪生和亨利福特，而愛迪生少年時代的頑皮和活動，又非常適合他的個性，因此在本片中，他不但發揮了最佳的演技，而且還把少年時代愛迪生活動的種種，表演得淋漓盡致，出神入化。再加上費朋脫喬治彭考夫，佛吉妮蕙特勒的配演，『孤童樂園』老搭擋瑙門泰堡氏的導演，其成功自然是在意料之中了。米蓋羅納爲了拍攝本片，在空閒的時候，不再編寫歌譜了，他每天不是孜孜不倦地閱讀着關於這位大科學家的傳記，便是練習摩斯電碼或硏究電池，所以當該片完成以後，他對於電報機，發電機，電燈，水門汀，蓄電池，電車，留聲機，電話等的知識，要比以前豐富得多了。</p>
<p>片中有許多道具都是道位大科學家的生前遺物。而愛迪生少年時代讀書的那所小小的紅瓦的學校以及一八六〇年愛迪生和他母親在哈隆小鎭居住的二層屋子，也都是實地考察後扌倣造的。米蓋羅納在本片開始拍攝的前一月，曾到迪屈洛脫地方綠田村的愛迪生故居旅行，那裏保存着這位大科學家生前的許多遺物·當時米蓋羅納還拜訪綠田村的圖書館館長法蘭西絲佐爾氏，這位老人是愛迪生生前的好友，也是親身見到愛迪生初次實騐電發燈光的惟一的人，米蓋羅納在他那裏聽到了許多這位大科學家少年時代的種種軼事，因此更增加了他拍攝本片的興趣和決心。</p>
<p>「要是沒有愛迪生，世界上就沒有電影」。米蓋羅納這樣說：「所以我必須努力拍攝本片，這樣扌能對得住這位電影的發明者」。</p>
<h3>李麗華的身世談</h3>
<p>— 水草</p>
<p>近年來藝華公司在不斷掘發新人下，終於被遇到了一僩極有希望的人村，她名叫李麗華，是一朶剛出水的芙蓉，從小就在戲班裏鍛鍊，有非常豐富的藝術天扌與學識，她過去的生活很像袁美雲，然而她的環境却比袁美雲好，所以，她的前途是更廣大的。</p>
<p>讀者要知道李麗華的身世嗎？那很簡單的，她父親是舊伶界裏很佔地位的小生李桂芳，李桂芳的美麗的扮相，過去曾傾倒過不少周郞癖的，李麗華她接受了她父親的遺傳，更秀美，更聰穎了。她進藝華雖還沒有多少時候，然而，她已很像一件晶潤的寳物一樣而得藝華公司裏的許多人底珍靦，李萍蓓捷足牛得請她主演「英烈傳」，公司當軸更不肯草率，而以當今唯一小生梅熹爲她合演。李麗華　她的天材，經騐，該是不難一舉成名的。</p>

<h3>國產影片新報道</h3>

<p>愛護國產片的影迷，很關心各製片公司的動態，以下這簡略的報道，便是最近的紀錄</p>
<p>（一）管　新華華新華成之中國聯合影業公司，已成而急待公映者，有劉瓊夏霞主演之「盡忠報國」，王元龍王獻齋主演之「忠義千秋」行將攝竣者有袁美雲梅熹之「西施」「雁門關」及「王先生做壽」等。</p>

<p>（四）民華公司之「孔夫子」，於十分愼重攝製中已吿竣事，費穆導演繼之將爲合衆籌攝「西太后」。此外聯美之「梁山伯祝英台」，富華之「黄　霸」，今日起已分別在滬光新光獻映，而顏鶴鳴之時裝五彩片「歡喜寃家」，祇等重見桃紅柳綠，續拍一塲外景，即可功德圓滿矣。</p>
<h3>話劇新人　（上）將在中旅「新梅蘿香」任主角之李靑來（下）藍靑，吳純眞，李靑來之表情</h3>
<p>— 李素攝</p>
<h3>「職業婦女」觀後</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>在封建的男性中心制度還殘留着的現社會，一般的婦女職業　不是一個「漂亮的點綴」，「花瓶」，這玩笑而侮辱的名稱，就是最好的憑證；而况有些機關還堂而皇之把「已婚女子」看作例外一的一羣呢。</p>
<p>石華父的「職業婦女」就是指斥這不合理的現象的，他是採用？喜劇形式把那些戴上假面具的「自私者」，加以無情諷嘲，而且更側面地加强了他們的罪惡，如憑籍了「地位」去「追求」女職員，而至舞弊營私。不過最後「諸位今天把我笑醒」，在假面具揭破以後還以莫須有的「串騙」來表示自己的尊嚴的「局長」，是不會在這一個「噴嚏」中笑醒的，這是作者的　恕。</p>
<p>全劇共分四幕，對白的風趣，結搆的美妙，使全劇流利地沉浸在詼諧的氣氛中。</p>
<p>導演手法頗接近美國電影的作風，如投花瓶，女備的送茶，幕帘前局長的「吹牛」，都是加强這喜劇的成功的。</p>
<p>在演員方面，缺乏羣體的帮襯，譬如第三幕中的姪少爺，在全體中他彷彿是突出的一個，於是他的喜劇中應有的誇大的動作反而流於過火。</p>
<p>在古裝戲進入到定型的時期，這一支喜劇的產生，多少爲我們的劇作家開闢了一條新的途徑。</p>
<h3>劇伶新聞</h3>
<p>— 海</p>
<p>卡爾登前台經理周翼華，爲救濟紹興桑梓被炸難胞，發起在月底演唱一次盛大的義務戲，仍由票伶兩界合作，此舉已經微得後台經理周信芳的同意，決演兩個夜塲，票價最高售三元，劇目在商派中。</p>
<p>坤旦王慧蟾，前晚在卡爾登登台，和高百歲，王仲平，葛次江合演玉堂春，她在七點鐘就下了後台，在那裏沒有向祖師爺焚香頂禮的儀節，就到金素雯，張慧聰，楊碧君在一起的化裝室去扮戲，袁美雲和慧蟾是親戚，所以也到扮戲房照料一切。</p>
<p>滬星國劇團　邀妥到菲列濱去的新角王俊宸，錢福綠，張艷霞，嚴春樓，李又芬一行五人，昨日乘渣華郵輪芝莎加拿號動身，伶界和影星都到碼頭來送客，很受大衆的注目。</p>
<p>王熙春，安舒元合組的春明劇團，除熙春母女外，全體人馬都在前天乘山東輪回到上海，熙春母女定九日乘輪賦歸，據說今天也可以到了。</p>

At 11:00 AM, they further captured Guloup, Huilongshan, and Gaotouling, pursuing northeast in victory. Simultaneously, the Chinese army south of Nanchang attacked Xiangtang and engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese south of Liantang. In addition, strongholds such as Yezishan, Huangxishi, Xincunxu, and Heshanli have also been successively recovered. The remnants of the Japanese army in Nanchang are trapped in a tight encirclement and are extremely panic-stricken. (11th dispatch)</p>
<p>Xiushui: The Chinese army advancing towards the outer perimeter of Nanchang has been actively advancing for days. One route has pressed to Xiangtang (south of Nanchang), and two routes have rushed to the east and west sides of Nanchang, engaging the Japanese in fierce battles. Another route, after recapturing strongholds such as Fengxin, Jing'an, and Gaoyoushi, pursued to the outskirts of Anyi, engaging in a fierce battle with approximately 3,000 Japanese troops sent from Nanchang for reinforcements. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties. Another route advanced to the vicinity of Zhang Gongdu. The Japanese in Nanchang are rushing to provide support everywhere, extremely disheveled. The Chinese army has completed a large encirclement and is intensifying its offensive. (11th dispatch)</p>
<p>Changsha: Last night, the Chinese army repelled the remnants of the Japanese army northwest of Nanchang and advanced to encircle Anyi. The Japanese sent large reinforcements from Nanchang, attempting to resist stubbornly. The Chinese are concentrating forces to annihilate them. The Chinese army advancing towards the Nanchang-Jiujiang line is making particularly rapid progress. Three other large armies have advanced to the front lines of the Japanese positions near Nanchang and are encircling the stubbornly resisting Japanese. (11th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: This office received a message from the Chinese side today stating that the Japanese army in Nanchang has breached the Fushui River embankment, flooding the rural areas south of Nanchang in an attempt to impede the Chinese army's advance. The Chinese army southwest of Nanchang, after recapturing Jing'an and Fengxin, has approached Anyi. (11th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin: The Chinese army in northern Jiangxi is currently launching a large-scale mopping-up operation towards the outer perimeter of Nanchang in multiple directions. One route rushed into Ganzhou, engaging in fierce street fighting with the Japanese army. One route captured Yaqiuling and Fenghuangshan, pursuing eastward.

Gaoyoushi was also captured by a certain Chinese unit at 7:00 PM on the 9th. The remnants of the Japanese army, before they could catch their breath, launched a counterattack against the Chinese last night, attempting to reverse the decline. After a night of fierce fighting, the exhausted Japanese were finally defeated by the Chinese. The battle for Ganzhou Street was particularly fierce, and a large number of Japanese were killed there. Currently, the Chinese army is in the newly recaptured areas, appeasing the refugees, in order to achieve cooperation between the army and the people, and inflict heavy damage on any re-invading Japanese.

<p>Chongqing: It is highly likely that the Chinese army in central China will recapture Nanchang, as the two important cities of Fengxin and Jing'an, as well as twenty important strongholds near Nanchang, have been recaptured by the Chinese. In the past four days, the Japanese army has been intensifying its defensive work in Nanchang. Because the Nanchang-Jiujiang Railway has been cut off by the Chinese army, the Japanese army in Nanchang has resorted to using waterways of Poyang Lake to seek supplies from Jiujiang.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>An Analysis of Germany's Invasion of Northern Europe</h3>
<p>President Roosevelt once said: "Aggression, like pestilence, is transmitted most rapidly." Since the September 18 Incident in 1931, the territory of sovereign states being occupied by force has been endless. In Europe alone, in the short span of the past two years, the map has completely changed for the four countries of Austria, Albania, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. Other countries that have lost territory and been humiliated include the three small Baltic states and Finland, which recently ended the war with painful concessions. Who knew that on the morning of April 9, 1940, Denmark and Norway in Northern Europe, which had been cautious and adhered to strict neutrality as their national policy, would also become the third or fourth batch of invaded countries under the beautiful name of "protection"?</p>
<p>Originally, since the outbreak of the war in Western Europe, the many powder kegs hidden in the European continent seemed to be preparing to explode. No one could say for sure where it would erupt first, but almost everyone felt that if peace could not be established quickly, the scourge of war would inevitably continue to expand. For example, in the past half year, not only Belgium and the Netherlands in Western Europe received frequent alarms, at least three or four times, but also the countries of Romania, Hungary, and Yugoslavia in Southeastern Europe were in constant danger and turmoil. Even the countries of the Near East felt uneasy. After the Finnish-Soviet peace, the general concern was still more focused on the Balkans, because from a military point of view, if Germany were to move in that direction, at least the intervention of the British and French allied forces would not come quickly, and therefore it would not be easy to achieve practical results. At that time, would Germany not gain more practical benefits with less effort? However, the reality was just the opposite. The tentacles of the German aggressors did not reach east, but north. Instead of using its "unparalleled mechanized troops in Europe" to rush into Hungary or Romania, which share borders, it sent its navy, which it knew was no match, to seize the Scandinavian Peninsula, which was easily attacked by the British and French allied forces. This cannot be said to be unexpected.</p>
<p>Of course, Hitler's every move was carefully calculated. There must be very important reasons why he did not seek development in the Balkans. According to the general explanation, this approach of temporarily maintaining the status quo in the Balkans seems to be the result of the conflicting interests of Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union. The reason is that Germany now dare not lose the two friendly countries of Italy and the Soviet Union, so it is unwilling to directly offend the interests of these two countries. Therefore, after the talks at the Brenner Pass and the contacts between Moscow and Berlin, Germany was willing to temporarily abandon Southeastern Europe and move its troops north.</p>
<p>However, we criticize Germany's actions from an objective standpoint and still feel that its invasion of Northern Europe was "unwise." Of course, Hitler hoped to occupy Denmark and Norway in one fell swoop, so that on the one hand, he could facilitate the supply of materials from Northern Europe and break the British and French blockade, and on the other hand, he could use the sea and air bases of Denmark and Norway to directly threaten Britain and France, thereby shaking the confidence of the Allied countries. However, in our view, these two goals may not necessarily be achieved.</p>
<p>First, Britain and France have always regarded respecting the neutrality of small countries as their national policy. Recently, because Germany has repeatedly abused the territorial waters of the neutral countries in Northern Europe, it has already decided to tighten the blockade. Now that Denmark and Norway have been invaded by Germany, the British and French allied forces not only do not have to worry about the neutrality of Northern Europe, but can instead use Germany's military action as an excuse to send troops to recover the lost territories for Denmark and Norway. In this way, tightening the blockade of the Northern European sea is of course more obligatory. At that time, Germany's Northern European shipping route may be completely cut off, and even the opportunity to use the Norwegian government to protest to Britain and France will be lost. Will the hope of facilitating Northern European supplies not be equal to empty talk?</p>
<p>Second, Germany's military action can indeed be considered agile and effective, able to control the entire territory of Denmark within 24 hours and send troops to land in most ports of Norway, truly demonstrating the momentum of breaking through bamboo. However, to put it bluntly, Germany can carry out this kind of surprise attack, and Britain and France can also do it. According to the latest news, although Germany has occupied many ports along the coast of Norway, the navies and air forces of Britain and France are joining forces with the Norwegian National Defense Army to counterattack. The outcome is still uncertain, but according to some reports, the British and French allied forces seem to be determined to effectively blockade the Northern European sea, ensuring that Germany cannot send reinforcements to the Norwegian front line. If this is achieved, then will the small number of German troops who landed in Norway the day before yesterday not become isolated and helpless? If Germany cannot quickly open a supply line from Sweden or other areas, will this isolated army not be annihilated soon? In this situation, Germany cannot directly threaten Britain and France, but on the contrary has fallen into the Allied forces' strategy of "luring the enemy out and annihilating them in a concentrated attack." Is this not very unwise?</p>
<p>But some people also say that Germany's actions are not as simple as they seem. Perhaps this is a strategic feint to the east while attacking in the west. It is nominally an advance to the north, but in reality, it still wants to attack to the west or seize to the east. Alternatively, it may have reached a tacit understanding with the Soviet Union, Italy, and even Japan, preparing to create a more chaotic situation so that everyone can fish in troubled waters. These speculations are of course possible, but we have no reason to believe them before there is concrete evidence. Strictly speaking, we feel that Germany's actions this time have a bit of a desperate gamble, just like the aggressor in the Far East - Japan - as if they are rushing around and eager to seek small victories to deceive their people, using all means and attempting to create a terrible situation to intimidate all of humanity! This kind of irrational behavior is like making a cocoon to trap oneself, like digging one's own grave! Leaving everything else aside, in terms of morality alone, will this act of forcibly occupying the territory of small countries without any reason not arouse greater revulsion in the entire civilized world?</p>
<p>President Roosevelt said: "Aggression is a pestilence." We might as well add: Aggression itself contains toxins, which not only poison others, but also poison the aggressor himself one day. The result of poisoning is the loss of reason and blind recklessness, the gradual loss of the power to control oneself, and the willingness to fall into the mire, to the point of being unable to extricate oneself. This principle should be deeply reflected upon by all the aggressor countries in the world. If they are still obsessed and do not wake up, then even someone as clever and alert as Hitler may inevitably have to eat his own bitter fruit one day. As for those below the gun, there is no need to say more.</p>
<h3>Churchill's Speech in the House of Commons: Determined to Fully Aid Norway; Britain Occupies the Danish Faroe Islands; Norway's Fallen Ports Not Yet Recovered</h3>
<p>London: The House of Commons convened today to hear a speech by First Lord of the Admiralty, Churchill. Members of the diplomatic corps present included the ambassadors of Argentina, Brazil, the United States, Belgium, the Soviet Union, China, Spain, Poland, and the Netherlands; the ministers of Sweden, Yugoslavia, Finland, and Latvia; the first secretary of the Norwegian legation; and the chargés d'affaires of Ecuador and Bolivia. First Lord Churchill began speaking at 3:48 PM, stating that while we have not yet recovered Norway's fallen ports, we have occupied the Faroe Islands, which belong to Denmark (located between Iceland and Britain). Once Denmark regains its freedom, we will return them to that country. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>London: Today, the House of Commons was very crowded for First Lord Churchill's speech. Initial questions were nearly inaudible due to the noise, demonstrating that whenever significant events occur, the entire House is eager to learn the facts of the day. When Mr. Churchill rose to speak, he was greeted with cheers. At the beginning of his speech, Mr. Churchill stated that in reporting facts or presenting details, there may be minor errors, and he hoped that Members would forgive him.</p>
<p>German Army's Invasion of Denmark and Norway: Long-Planned. Mr. Churchill said: The tension and unnatural calm of the past few weeks were violently shattered on the morning of Monday. On that morning, the German army suddenly invaded both Norway and Denmark. This crime was, of course, long-planned and meticulously prepared, only waiting until the last week of March to launch. We have received intelligence that large German merchant ships are being converted into troop carriers, and countless smaller ships are berthed in ports along the Baltic Sea and the mouth of the Elbe River; this has been the case for months. But no one can say when they will be used, or to coerce which peaceful nation. Denmark, Norway, and Sweden all seemed to be in danger of sudden and barbaric attacks. One of the three countries would be chosen as the sacrificial victim, and when the first strike would occur remained a matter of pure speculation. The Nazi government is accustomed to constantly spreading various threats and deceptions through all available channels, relying on its personnel stationed in various neutral countries, including the bells of its consulates and embassies, (laughter from the audience) and any sympathizers and supporters it can find anywhere. (Cheers and laughter) I assure everyone that this is not specifically directed at any particular individual. All these countries have been subjected to threats. The German government is not bound by law and has no qualms of conscience. Its government officials clearly advocate attacking the weak and leaving the strong for later. Therefore, the smaller countries around it are in a state of great panic, as they still are now. Even those neutral countries that are trying their best to show goodwill to Germany and provide it with the greatest assistance cannot guarantee that the Germans will not launch a sudden and unreasonable attack, quickly overthrow their countries, and plunder all their assets. Therefore, these unfortunate countries are all uneasy, wondering who will be next. We now know that on the early morning of Monday, Norway and Denmark drew the unlucky numbers in this terrible lottery. Denmark had special reasons to fear, not only because it was Germany's closest and weakest neighbor, but also because it had recently signed an agreement with Germany guaranteeing it would not be disturbed. (Laughter) Denmark and both Britain and Germany were engaged in active commerce. The continuation of this trade during wartime was long anticipated by Germany and a special trade arrangement was agreed upon by the German and Danish governments to guarantee it. This clearly placed Denmark in a particularly dangerous position.</p>
<p>The Biggest Obstacle to Blocking Germany: The Norwegian Corridor</p>
<p>The unique shape of the Norwegian west coast forms a kind of corridor or shortcut, allowing the trade of neutral countries and various German ships to pass through the territorial waters of Norway and Sweden, avoiding the Allied blockade. The existence of this geographic and legal route of cover has been a great disadvantage to us, and a great benefit to Germany's efforts to break the Allied blockade. German warships come and go at will, German submarines take advantage of it, and German postal ships and merchant ships attempting to return to Germany from the open sea also follow this route of more than 800 miles. The biggest obstacle to blocking Germany is this Norwegian corridor; this was the case in the last war, and it is still the case in the current war.</p>
<p>The British Navy was forced to sit idly by and watch German and neutral ships transporting various contraband goods to Germany, which could have been stopped at any time, but because of the existence of international law, they were unwilling to violate it, while Germany, in this war, has done everything possible to despise international law, just as it did in the last war.</p>
<p>During the last war, when we were allied with the United States, the Allies suffered greatly because German submarines used this covered route as a base for their piratical activities. Therefore, the British, French, and American governments jointly requested the Norwegian government to lay mines in the territorial waters of this covered route to prevent German submarines from using the route to commit violence.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of this war, the Admiralty naturally had to bring this modern and highly respected precedent to the attention of the British government, urging it to allow us to lay mines in Norwegian waters, forcing ships entering and leaving Germany to sail in the open sea, giving us the opportunity to subject them to contraband controls or to seize them as war prizes by the blockading fleet. But the government was extremely hesitant even about this technical violation of international law, fearing criticism. This was reasonable and proper. We tried to act in accordance with international law, but soon we gradually felt that if this route continued to be used, the Allies would suffer endlessly, and we watched week after week as ships sailed along this corridor, fully loaded with iron sand destined for Germany, to be used to make bullets to kill young British and French men in the 1941 war. It was truly unbearable. Therefore, we finally decided that the unease in our conscience had already caused us damage, but it could also win us glory. We cut off traffic on this route, forcing all ships to pass through the open sea. The British government announced the laying of minefields at dawn on Monday, taking all kinds of precautions to prevent neutral ships or lives from being slightly endangered, even taking into account enemy ships.</p>
<p>The Nazi government attempted to use our blockade of the Norwegian corridor as an excuse to attack Norway and Denmark, but we can undoubtedly prove that the German preparations began well over a month ago, and that the actual movements of its troops and ships began before the British and French laid the mines. The Germans apparently guessed that we would lay mines, but they did not expect it to happen so soon. Therefore, in the last week of March, the Germans decided to use the Norwegian corridor, sending empty ships carrying iron sand back home, fully loaded with military supplies, with German troops hidden below, so that when the order was given, they could occupy various strategically valuable ports along the Norwegian coast, and at the same time launch a long-prepared offensive to strike two innocent neutral countries that had assisted them in various ways. We express our deep sympathy to the people of Norway. (Cheers) We hear that Norway is now trapped in a dire dilemma. The emotions of the Norwegian people, like those of other small countries, lean towards the Allies. They endure their suffering with hopeless anger, for dozens of their ships have been sunk, and many of their sailors have been drowned.</p>
<p>They fully recognize that their future independence and freedom are linked to the victory of the Allies. They hoped until the last moment that their land and cities would not be ravaged by the German army, and that their freedom and lives would not be plundered by foreign aggressors. But this hope ultimately proved illusory. Nazi Germany has committed atrocities against a small and friendly nation. The Norwegian government and people are now taking up arms to defend their homes and country. (Cheers)</p>
<p>Only by Restoring the Freedom of the Norwegian People Can Peace Be Discussed. We will do everything in our power to help them. (Cheers) We will fight with them. Only by restoring their rights and freedom can peace be discussed. (Cheers) The vast, mountainous areas of Norway offer numerous strongholds for free people to hide and fight, enabling them to maintain long-term and fierce resistance against those who seek to conquer them. The fate of Norway serves as a warning to other neutral countries who naively believe that friendship with Germany, or German guarantees, or any kind of treaty with Germany, can afford them protection from aggression. Once Germany sees an advantage, it will turn ruthless. If the Norwegian government had not strictly enforced its neutrality to our disadvantage, and had not allowed its corridor to be used by Germany to carry out its conspiracies, and if the Norwegian government had established a relationship of mutual trust with us earlier, we would have had ample opportunity to assist them, and it would have been much easier than it is today. If these neutral countries had rejected the Allies from afar before being subjected to a planned German attack, it would be unfair to condemn the Allies for not providing practical assistance and protection. He believed that Norway's current plight was mainly due to its strict adherence to neutrality.</p>
<p>Mr. Churchill continued, saying that he believed there would inevitably be questions from some quarters about what the Navy was doing. He wished to explain the situation as fully as possible, both past and present, but he regretted that he could not disclose anything about the future and ongoing operations. About five weeks ago, the Home Fleet returned to Scapa Flow for rest, and from there set out to carry out operations. We have experienced continuous air raid alerts and several air raids, but we now have extremely powerful anti-aircraft positions, operating in conjunction with other defense methods, and we have agreed on excellent measures with the Royal Air Force and the Naval Air Arm, so that we have ample aircraft squadrons available for deployment at a great distance. During the first German air raid, a cruiser was hit in the stern, requiring several weeks of repair. Other than that, as of the time of this speech, no ship in Scapa Flow has been hit or damaged, and no target of military importance on shore has been hit by German aircraft. The number of injured is extremely small. According to our observations, the enemy is gradually becoming afraid of the power of the artillery when attacking Scapa Flow. This is not surprising, because the shore batteries, supplemented by the powerful artillery positions of the fleet, can be said to be the most powerful concentrated anti-aircraft fire in the world.</p>
<p>If these neutral countries had rejected the Allies from afar before being subjected to a planned German attack, it would be unfair to condemn the Allies for not providing practical assistance and protection. He believed that Norway's current plight was mainly due to its strict adherence to neutrality. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>National Political Council: Important Consequences</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The recently concluded Fifth National Political Council had two most important results: (1) Chairman Chiang reiterated the government's determination to continue the war of resistance, as announced by Chairman Chiang in his closing remarks yesterday. This announcement, issued by the highest authority in the country, will automatically eliminate all rumors circulating at home and abroad about possible changes in the government's policies. (2) The motion to revise the draft constitution promulgated on May 5, 1936, has failed. There was also a proposal to establish a National Political Commission after the end of this session of the Political Council and before the convening of the National Assembly. This motion, after heated discussion, was also rejected. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>Price Suppression Bill Passed by the Political Council</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The current problem of rising prices was given great importance by this session of the Political Council. There were more than ten proposals from the councilors, along with those submitted by the government, all hoping that the government would take emergency measures, strictly crack down on unscrupulous merchants' monopoly, hoarding and speculation, and also hoping to adjust the price control agencies and facilitate transportation. Based on the temporary motion of Councilor Yang Duanliu and 101 others, a special committee was organized to review the price issue, with the Fourth Review Committee as the center, and all councilors were free to participate in joint research, and the four ministers of Finance, Economy, Transportation, and Interior were invited to attend to explain, so as to have a thorough discussion. The special committee held several meetings, the discussion time was quite long, and submitted a review report to the General Assembly. On the 10th, the General Assembly resolved, in addition to sending the original case to the government, and attached many suggestions, the main points are recorded as follows: (1) Unite the highest authorities to form a strong control organization, and select an impartial and upright official to be given full power to preside over it. (2) The measures of finance and finance must pay attention to their impact on prices, actively promote the sale of public bonds, national construction savings, to absorb idle funds, and try to make the funds of commercial and local banks used for production. (3) Reduce redundant agencies, and stop construction projects unrelated to the war of resistance, and vigorously carry out the thrift movement, especially paying attention to the upper class in the cities. (4) Substantially increase loans for production projects, in addition to guaranteeing interest and tax exemption, a fixed period of protection should also be given. (5) Transportation agencies should try to transport the accumulated goods in various places, and the transportation of necessities should be subsidized by the government when necessary. As for the steps to stabilize prices, start with rice, flour, oil, salt, cotton, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and coal, and then gradually include building materials and hardware materials. The government is also expected to instruct the price-controlled purchase and sale offices to purchase daily necessities and distribute them to consumer cooperatives for sale. In places where there are no consumer cooperatives, the government should be urged to establish them as soon as possible. After our government has implemented this, if there are still hoarders and speculators, they should be tried according to military law after being found out, and the government should select senior officials to supervise at any time, and those who disrupt the price and fail to implement the laws should be severely punished.

<h3>State Council Issues Decree Commending Tang Juwu</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The State Council issued a decree on the 10th: Northeast Guerrilla Commander Tang Juwu has, for many years, led righteous troops and fought in the provinces of Hebei and Jehol, repeatedly establishing extraordinary achievements. In the battle of Pingtai Mountain last summer, he valiantly annihilated stubborn Japanese troops, sustained serious injuries, yet continued to fight bravely, eventually sacrificing his life. His spirit of loyalty, courage, and sacrifice is indeed worthy of commendation and emulation. He should be commended by decree, posthumously awarded the rank of Major General in the Army, and the Military Commission should deliberate on generous compensation. His life's deeds should be recorded and stored in the History Museum to honor his loyalty and martyrdom, and to demonstrate to future generations. This decree (10th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Speaker of the Norwegian Parliament Arrives in Sweden, Describes Government Evacuation</h3>
<p>Helsinki: Finnish radio station has just broadcast that the Speaker of the Norwegian Parliament, Hambro, has departed from the Norwegian capital for Stockholm. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: Today, when the Speaker of the Norwegian Parliament, Hambro, arrived here, he gave a detailed account of the heroic deeds of fifteen Norwegian outposts who fought fiercely against a hundred German vanguard troops while covering the government's retreat from Hamar to Elverum. He said that this outpost was the only Norwegian force on the road to Hamar. They immediately resisted and contained the German troops, and all the soldiers died for their country. Hambro stated that the Norwegian Parliament has ordered him to serve abroad, during times of need, as a representative of the Norwegian government, and that when the special train carrying the Norwegian King and government officials arrived in Lillehammer, the nearby Kjeller airfield was being bombed. All the passengers on the train took refuge in the air raid shelter in the station, and only continued forward after the air raid was over. Hambro also said that 145 of the 150 members of the Norwegian Parliament attended the meeting in Hamar. Upon receiving intelligence that the Germans intended to capture the government and Parliament in Hamar, it was decided to move the government to Elverum. The gold reserves and securities of the Norwegian National Bank have all been transported from Oslo to a location deemed safe. Hambro continued to describe the military situation, stating that German warships were unable to reach Oslo, so German troops landed at Moss and Drøbak, carrying sixteen armored vehicles. The German troops advanced from Moss to the Ski station, and then from there to Oslo. The German troops landing in Bergen numbered 5,000, but they were intercepted not far from there. The Norwegian warship Norge sank a large German warship near Horten, believed to be the battlecruiser Gneisenau, as well as two smaller ships. Two German submarines have sunk. The crew of the Norge landed after the battle, and 400 of them marched towards Oslo. Hambro concluded by saying that the Western powers have provided all assistance without Norway's request.

(2) In the current international situation, the Danish authorities can no longer handle our country's diplomatic affairs (Article 7 of the Danish-Icelandic Union Act) and cannot inspect fisheries in our country's territorial waters (Article 8).

<h3>Germany Negotiating Navigation with Balkan Countries, Bulgaria Denies German Demand to Control Danube, Italy Pays Attention to Interests in Adriatic Sea, Balkan Envoys Meet in London</h3>
<p>Berlin: The German and Romanian governments have agreed that since the United Kingdom has attempted to obstruct navigation on the Danube River, there is a need to protect the Danube River and its navigation.

<h3>British Foreign Secretary Explains Norway's Position, Britain and France Recognize Norway as Their Ally, Determined to Prevent Germany from Consolidating Its Power</h3>
<p>London: British Foreign Secretary Halifax explained Norway's position at a banquet of the National Defense and Public Interest Committee yesterday, saying that although there are rumors that Germany is conducting negotiations to force the new Norwegian government to recognize the German occupation, the Allied powers will recognize Norway as their ally. Information from Norway is very brief, and news of other events in the North Atlantic is also scarce. The Allied governments will regard any negotiations between Germany and Norway as acts of coercion under force. Our determination to resist German tyranny against powerless Norway and our own resistance to Germany's expansion of power in the North Sea and the Atlantic will not be affected by this. Because Britain will never allow Germany to extend its power into the North Sea and the Atlantic. The strong British and French navies are currently cooperating in Norwegian territorial waters. Prime Minister Chamberlain will report to Parliament on Thursday on the progress of British and French military efforts to prevent Germany from consolidating its position in Norway. In his opinion, Germany's recent actions are due to internal weakness. However, in any case, this is a lesson for neutral countries who did not prepare for assistance and regretted it too late. The Allied powers were forced to lay mines and infringe on Norwegian neutrality, but the Allied methods are humane, unlike Germany's violence. Regarding Germany's claim that the destruction of the independence of the other two countries is reasonable retaliation, he knows that world opinion will not agree. The Foreign Secretary also mentioned the Anglo-French war agreement, saying that Britain and France are now working together for common welfare, not only in the colonies but also in the labor-management and education movements. If there had been a similar agreement in the last war, the history of the past twenty years would have been different. The conduct of the war depends on the ability of the volunteer forces to adapt to the work. All the energy of the 80 million people of Britain and France is focused on the final victory of the war. This great organizational structure will eventually prove to be irresistible. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>Three Goals of Anglo-French Military Action</h3>
<p>London: According to well-informed sources, the Anglo-French military actions in Northern Europe currently have only two goals: (1) to destroy the German fleet currently in the waters off northern Norway (this fleet is the first to leave German ports since the outbreak of the European war); (2) to quickly recapture the Norwegian ports occupied by German troops and to completely eliminate all enemy supply and escort ships berthed in the ports; (3) to constantly try to intercept Germany's attempts to send new troops to Norway from the North Sea or the Kattegat Strait. In addition, the Anglo-French air forces have been working with the navies. British air force bases are only 300 kilometers from the coast of Norway, which is very convenient for scheduling. Not only that, but the Anglo-French army authorities will also send expeditionary forces to Norway to fight in the near future. If so, the German troops who have already landed will be unable to obtain foreign aid from the Atlantic or the North Sea. At that time, if Germany wants to send new troops to Norway, it will have to go through Sweden. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>Burma Strengthens Defenses</h3>

<h3>French Premier's Report on the Situation in Northern Europe</h3>
<p>Paris - Premier Reynaud delivered a speech in the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon, reporting on the situation in Northern Europe. The gist of his remarks included: Germany will certainly wage a "war for iron ore" in the Scandinavian Peninsula. However, I dare to assert that the sole result will be that the country will be unable to obtain this iron ore, not only at present but also in the future. In short, Germany needs to acquire overseas steel to attack us. However, today that country is already surrounded. It has indeed been complacent in Denmark. As for Norway, it has encountered setbacks because it anticipated that the country would not resist. In essence, what it expected was the capitulation of Austria in 1938, but what it actually encountered was the brave resistance of Belgium in 1914. That is all. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>

Only one person sustained minor injuries, and there was no other damage. British warships immediately opened fire with anti-aircraft guns, shooting down three enemy aircraft. Fighter aircraft also scrambled to intercept and shot down one aircraft.

One enemy pilot parachuted down and was captured by sailors from a British destroyer. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>

<h3>Municipal Council Elections: Major Victory for the British-American Front; All British-American Candidates Elected; Two Japanese Candidates Elected, Rest Defeated; Chinese and Foreigners Alike Rejoice that the Status Quo of the Settlement is Preserved</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council election continued yesterday morning. Although the work of the ballot counters and collectors at both locations was extremely tense, the order was orderly. The British-American united front did its best to fight against the Japanese side, and they all held optimistic and confident psychology. After the short-range handover of Jari, the voting procedures were completed as scheduled at 3 pm yesterday to determine the future position and destiny of the public species boundary. After the voting was closed at 3 pm yesterday, the ballot inspectors Brandeburg, Bellingert, and others sealed the ballot boxes tightly and escorted them to the Municipal Council Building under armed guard to count the votes. This was completed at around 3 am this morning. The results of the ballot counting and the general situation yesterday are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Elected Directors: The results of the Municipal Council election votes were calculated at 3:30 this morning (12th) and announced by the Municipal Council Information Office. A total of:</p>
<p>Nine candidates were elected:</p>
<p>(1) Allman: 8,000 votes (2) Carnie</p>
<p>(3) Keize威: 7,883 votes (4) He萊</p>
<p>(5) Powell: 7,860 votes (6) Rotlic Macdonald</p>
<p>(7) Mitchell: 7,830 votes (8) Hagakawa Yūta</p>
<p>Four candidates were defeated:</p>
<p>(1) Gangben Yice: 5,203 votes (2) Kuroda Keita郎</p>
<p>(3) Gangben Yiyi (4) Reynolds Macdonald</p>
<p>Overall, seven British and American candidates and two Japanese candidates were elected.</p>
<p>As for the total number of valid ballots cast, there were 13,098, and 98 invalid ballots.</p>
<p>Total Number of Votes Exceeds Ten Thousand</p>
<p>According to the Japanese side, because the Japanese residents' voting qualifications were increased by 500 at the last minute, Japanese taxpayers could cast more than 4,000 votes in two days. Of these 4,000 votes, more than 3,200 votes had already been cast on the first day (because the Japanese election office issued more than 1,800 election certificates that day, and the Mitsui Bussan office issued more than 400 election certificates). The remaining approximately 700 votes could still be cast in full on the second day. The Japanese side estimated that the total number of votes this time would be more than 11,000. The British and American candidates had only secured the same number of votes as the Japanese in advance.</p>
<p>Ballot Boxes Concentrated and Guarded by Armed Forces</p>
<p>In view of the fierce competition in this election, the Municipal Council was sincerely afraid of conspiracies. In addition to strict security measures at the polling stations, the protection of the ballot boxes was also extremely thorough. For the past two days, the ballot boxes that had been cast in various locations were sealed with strict seals on the spot and escorted to the Municipal Council for safekeeping. Armed guards were on duty all night to avoid negligence and did not change shifts.</p>
<p>The Status Quo of the Settlement is Unchangeable</p>
<p>The reporter was deeply concerned that if the British-American united front was defeated by the Japanese side in this election, the administrative power of the settlement would be seized or controlled by the Japanese side from then on, and the status quo of the settlement would inevitably change. He visited a certain person in the settlement who had the most power and authority yesterday to inquire about his opinion. According to him, during the election, the Japanese side requested to increase the number of candidates to five, due to a long period of brewing and full preparation, using the special political influence of individual events, their strength should not be underestimated. However, in the event that the British-American united front is defeated by the Japanese side, the administrative management of the settlement will be seized or controlled by the Japanese side, and although the situation is worrying, it is not yet certain. Even if all the Japanese candidates are elected, if five of the nine Western directors are removed, the British and Americans will still occupy four seats, combined with the five Chinese directors, there will be a total of nine people. With nine against five, with the United States, China, and Britain to deal with these five Japanese directors, the Japanese side must occupy an advantage, and all administrative management facilities will still be decided by this majority. The Japanese side fundamentally has no way to indulge. When it came to this, the reporter asked a certain person, "Suppose the Japanese side uses various tricks to try to destroy the positions of the five Chinese directors after the election is announced, or proposes to include a bitter worker in the list of members, will this tripartite united front not be defeated?" A certain person replied with a solemn and firm attitude, "Millions of Chinese citizens in the city have already declared to China and abroad that they have decided to support the positions of the five Chinese directors in the previous session. If anyone opposes or destroys them, it is tantamount to challenging the masters of the settlement who enjoy sovereignty, and it is tantamount to challenging the most powerful people in the settlement. I think no one should be so foolish, and the British and Chinese ultimately have great interests in the settlement. The governments of both countries will never ignore the decline of the settlement. Even the Japanese still have concerns about the United States, and they may not dare to do whatever they want without restraint. Otherwise, millions of Chinese people would rather see the entire settlement destroyed than lightly give up their legitimate rights."</p>
<h3>Marshall's Warning Remarks Against the Japanese Army's Exclusion of the Rights and Interests of Third Countries; Monopolizing Everything Under the Pretext of Military Affairs; But Such Measures Will Inevitably Backfire</h3>
<p>The British and Chinese Harmony Business Association held its annual meeting at its office at No. 17 Bund at 5:05 pm yesterday. Chairman Marshall delivered a speech on the spot, discussing the recent business situation of British expatriates under the so-called "influence of the New Order in East Asia." The attendees and the British Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. George, were all moved by Marshall's alarming remarks. Marshall said,</p>
<p>Action Does Not Match Words: The policies currently adopted under the slogan of the "New Order in East Asia" are contrary to the principles of open doors and equal opportunity. It is difficult for us to imagine how significant an impact this policy will have on the Chinese people and foreign businessmen. The Japanese army's so-called difficulty in opening up business in the Yangtze River and Pearl River due to military relations is actually a deceptive talk. According to the current investigation, the issue of opening up all commercial ports and the Yangtze River and Pearl River is by no means hindered by military relations, but is actually due to the Japanese people not allowing foreigners to rebuild or restore the old state of these areas. The suffering currently suffered by the Chinese people in Shanghai, and the soaring prices caused by the inability to continuously transport various daily necessities to Shanghai, cannot be tolerated if their cause is said to be due to military relations. The root cause lies entirely in the various restrictions and heavy donations imposed by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Backfire: But I dare to assert that the Japanese army's measures will inevitably backfire in the future. In this situation, it is impossible to gradually prosper the Japanese-occupied areas. The Japanese army has repeatedly stated that it is willing to respect the rights and interests of foreigners in China, but the situation in Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, Hankou, and other places is sufficient to prove that people have not implemented even one ten-thousandth of their promises. The Tianjin concession is still under blockade. British shipping in Qingdao is subject to great restrictions and blows. The arrogance of the "anti-British movement" in North China has increased unabated. But at this time, Japanese ships have almost monopolized all passenger and cargo transportation in various places, especially inland river shipping, which has been completely controlled by the Japanese. Taking the situation in Shanghai as an example, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, almost all the wharves where foreign ships can dock are within the sphere of influence of the Japanese army. This loss is currently difficult to calculate.</p>
<p>Opinions on China: In addition, Mr. Marshall also expressed his views on the cooperation projects in southwest China. He believes that the products needed by China, the destination, can actually be self-sufficient. Transportation difficulties are inevitable, but if small factories are set up, the transportation problem will not be serious. He also believes that even after peace is achieved, these factories will still be in place. During China's military state, Mr. Li believes that the Japanese army is currently in a difficult situation. Although the Japanese side superficially occupies a very large area, due to the activities of guerrillas, the area they can rule is actually very small.</p>
<h3>The Responsibility the United States Should Bear in the Sino-Japanese War; Giving Tools to Thugs to Do Evil; If You Want to Remain Neutral, You Should Know How to Remedy It; Dr. Baker's Speech at the University in New York</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that the Christian Science Monitor reports that Dr. Baker, the director of the China International Relief Association, recently gave a speech in New York criticizing the part of the responsibility that the United States bears in this Sino-Japanese War. He said that the duty of the United States lies in maintaining neutrality throughout the Sino-Japanese War. However, the United States has not been neutral except in technical aspects. The United States has given tools to thugs, thereby doing evil, and it still does so today. If we want to remain neutral, we must at least take some action to remedy the destruction caused by the tools we have supplied. Dr. Baker also urged the United States to maintain its missionary work in China, saying that the American missionaries in China have adhered to the true Christian spirit in this war, being in danger, not leaving their posts, and making great sacrifices to preserve the cause established by their predecessors in the Far East. If the church in China is forced not to receive assistance, the Christian cause established in China in the previous century and its current work will be threatened. Dr. Baker finally urged the United States to stop supplying weapons to Japan.</p>

<h3>Czech Woman Abducted by Three Japanese in Hongkou Yesterday; Released Only in the Afternoon with Eye and Leg Injuries; Rumored to be Related to This Year's Board Election; Puppet Police Make Things Difficult for British Women; Japanese Soldiers Intimidate Young Girls</h3>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening Post reports that Japanese and police under Japanese protection have kidnapped a Czech woman and stopped a British woman driving a car in the past 24 hours, and attempted to stab two British girls with guns. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Czech Girl Suddenly Kidnapped</p>
<p>Miss Silk, a Czech girl, lives in Riverside Mansion. At 10:30 this morning (11th), she was talking to several immigrants on the sidewalk on Peng Road near the Hongkou vegetable market. Suddenly, a car with license plate number 4067 drove up beside her. Three Japanese jumped out of the car, grabbed Miss Silk rudely, dragged her into the car, and then sped off towards Yangshupu. A few minutes later, someone saw the car speeding along Huade Road, and Silk was struggling desperately in the car. Her sharp screams attracted the attention of pedestrians in the area. It is believed that the motive for the kidnapping may be related to the Municipal Council affairs election. The Japanese may believe that Silk advised immigrants not to elect Japanese candidates to the polling station. According to a follow-up report from this newspaper at midnight yesterday, the Czech girl, Silk, had already returned home at about 4:00 pm. Both eyes and legs were seriously injured, with bruises on her eyes and tooth marks on her cheeks. After she reported the details to the police station, she went to a doctor for treatment.</p>
<p>British Woman Driving Car with Puppet Police Making Things Difficult</p>
<p>At 11:00 am, Mrs. Dean, a British woman, was driving her car in front of Yiding Road when she collided with a bicycle. As soon as the road was repaired, the Dadao police arrived at the scene and forced Mrs. Dean to go to the Dadao Police Station. Mrs. Dean then drove to the front of the British sentry post at the nearby Yiyu Road intersection to seek protection. Major Hunter, a British officer who was good at speaking Japanese, arrived at the scene and immediately called the Jing'an Temple Police Station and the Japanese Gendarmerie on Jessefield Road. The Jing'an Temple Police Station sent someone to the scene and saw that it was a minor incident. Mrs. Dean drove to the Jing'an Temple Police Station to report. At that time, the settlement police and a certain military unit were present. Several Dadao police officers jumped onto the footboard of Mrs. Dean's car in a menacing manner. However, after Special Officer Te sent a telephone call to the Japanese gendarmerie, an officer of the Dadao police heard the news and rushed to the scene and ordered the Dadao police to withdraw. Mrs. Dean was then able to drive to the Jing'an Temple Police Station to report. Major Hunter then made a verbal protest to the Japanese authorities about the matter.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Threaten British Girl with Guns</p>
<p>Also, Sarine Hai, the daughter of Mr. Hai, a British man from the power company, was walking along Yangshupu Road with her friend from the Central Asian country at 4 pm yesterday, taking several photos of each other. Suddenly, four Japanese soldiers (not the marine landing team) ran near the Dinghai Road Bridge with rifles and bayonets, shocking the woman, who took refuge in the Mobil Oil Company building. Miss Hai called her father. A few minutes later, Mr. Hai arrived and saw the Japanese soldiers waiting outside the door. The two sides argued for half an hour on the settlement road in the Japanese Marine Corps defense zone. Mr. Hai decided to hand over the camera. The Japanese soldiers took out the film and returned the camera. The matter ended.</p>
<h3>American Radio Station Disturbed; Japan Has Not Found the Source; Claiming That They Must First Obtain Definite Facts; American Radio Station Disturbed More Severely Than Before for Several Days</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that the British merchant Wuzhan Radio Station (call sign XMHA) has been negotiating with the Japanese Ministry of Finance because its Lebo was disturbed. The Japanese side officially announced yesterday (10th) that it had not found the source of the disturbance, but the radio station's radio waves were disturbed even more yesterday. A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy claimed at a press conference yesterday that the American Acting Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Burtlick, and the radio station manager, Mr. Hailey, visited Japanese Consul-General Sanura yesterday afternoon. According to Miura, he said that he must first obtain "definite facts" before taking steps. XMHA Radio Station changed its wavelength due to disturbances, but the new wavelength happened to be the radio wave of a certain Japanese radio station that has existed for a long time.</p>
<h3>International Labor Conference Consults Representative Candidates</h3>
<p>This Year's Maritime Representative May Be Appointed by the Central Government</p>
<p>The 26th International Labor Conference is scheduled to open in Geneva on June 6. The International Labor Office has informed the Chinese Branch to solicit candidates for the Chinese delegation to attend the conference from the government, employers, and labor unions, as well as maritime representatives. The China General Association of Industry and Commerce and the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China have decided to gather in Geneva to discuss and elect representatives, consultants, and secretaries from the employer delegation, as well as to propose funds for early telegrams to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for appointment. As for the labor delegation and the government delegation, they will be appointed by the Central Government. As for maritime representatives, the previous Tian Chinese Seafarers' Special Party Department and the Chinese Seamen's Union elected this year or will be appointed by the Central Government.</p>
<h3>Aluminum Auxiliary Coins; The Second Batch Has Also Arrived in Shanghai; A Total of 10 Million Coins, Half One Cent and Half Five Cent Coins; It is Decided to Issue It Immediately After the First Batch is Issued</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Banking Association submitted an application to the Ministry of Finance to issue one-cent and five-cent aluminum auxiliary coins, the first batch has been transferred to various banks and money shops by the Bank Preparation Committee, the Money Industry Preparation Bank, and the British HSBC Bank, and has been circulating in the Shanghai market, which citizens call convenient and harmonious. Yesterday, it was learned that the second batch of 10 million coins, half one-cent and half five-cent coins, namely 50,000 yuan for one-cent coins and 250,000 yuan for five-cent coins, has now arrived in Shanghai. It has been decided to issue it immediately after the first batch has been issued.</p>
<h3>Postage Increase; Approved by Both Houses</h3>
<p>Implementation is Only a Matter of Time; Not Related to the Fiscal Year</p>
<p>Regarding the domestic postage increase, a reporter from Datong News Agency learned from the responsible party of the Shanghai Postal Administration that it has been determined and approved by the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan, so it is only a matter of time. Outsiders do not understand the postal situation and say that the postage increase must be implemented with the fiscal year, which is not true. The last price increase was on May 1, 1932, when post offices across the country began to increase prices, but the Shanghai Post Office delayed it until May 30. Therefore, knowing the above facts, we know that the statement that the price increase must follow the fiscal year is purely speculation.</p>
<h3>American Giant Protection Ship; It is Said to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow; There are Also Four Submarines Coming with It; It is Expected That Other Ships Will Continue to Sail East</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that it is widely rumored in Pingshi that the American submarine protection ship USS Canopus and four submarines are about to arrive in Shanghai from the south. Although there is no official news, it is reliably believed that the ship and submarines may arrive here on Saturday or Sunday. The general public believes that the annual spring cruise of the US Navy off the coast of China will not be held this year. However, if the submarines and the USS Canopus sail to Shanghai, it is expected that other warships will follow.</p>
<p>American Transport Ship Arrives in Shanghai in September</p>
<p>The Chinese-Western Newspaper also reports that the US Navy transport ship USS Wharton, with a deadweight of 13,788 tons, will cross the Pacific for the first time this summer and arrive in Shanghai around September. At that time, the ship will be the largest American warship docked in the Huangpu River, because the deadweight of the USS Augusta is only 10,000 tons, and the deadweight of the USS Henderson is only 10,500 tons. The USS Wharton was previously the Southern Cross of the American Republican Shipping Company and was purchased by the US Navy last year and converted into a transport ship, named after Lieutenant Colonel Wharton, the second commander of the US Marine Corps.</p>
<p>Another New Ship Converted into a Transport Ship</p>
<p>The USS Santa Clara, also purchased by the US Navy from the Grace Shipping Company, has also been converted into a transport ship, named after Lieutenant Colonel Burroughs, the first commander of the US Marine Corps, named the USS Burroughs. The ship has a deadweight of 4,576 tons and may not be dispatched to the Pacific. It may sail between the east and west coasts of the United States with the USS Chaumont, which has withdrawn from the East, while leaving the USS Wharton and USS Henderson to sail in the Pacific. According to unconfirmed reports from naval circles in this city, although the USS Chaumont has withdrawn from the Pacific at the beginning of this year, it has been designated to sail to the East again once and is expected to arrive in Shanghai before September, and then return to the United States.</p>
<p>USS Henderson Brings Defense Force</p>
<p>The USS Henderson transport ship will arrive in Wusong on or about May 1, and it is estimated that it will carry about 300 soldiers who will join the US Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai, as well as hundreds of Navy and Marine Corps soldiers dispatched to various ships of the Asian Fleet. At the time, two companies of the Fourth Marine Regiment will leave Shanghai on the USS Henderson to train in Qinhuangdao, and about 270 Marine Corps soldiers whose terms of service in Shanghai have expired will take the USS Henderson back to the United States on its return trip south.</p>
<h3>The American Overseas Chinese Association of This City; Five People Have Completed Their Terms and Are Being Re-elected</h3>
<p>The American Overseas Chinese Association of this city has a total of 15 members. According to the association's announcement yesterday, 5 of the 15 people have completed their terms and will be re-elected from 16 candidates. The list is as follows: Botehuier, Bowen, Botun, Haining Sheng, Li Fan, Mai Meilun, Obage, Boto, Boddemen, Lidi, Robert Tuchel Lin, Lüdi, Watson, Macdonald, and Bardyun.</p>
<h3>Danish Merchant Ships on the Far East Line Awaiting Orders, Jebsen's Two Ships Likely Unable to Leave Chinese Waters, Norwegian Ships Temporarily Continuing Operations Unaffected</h3>
<p>Recently, the European situation has suddenly become tense. The entire territory of Denmark has been controlled by the German army. Denmark is unable to resist and has acquiesced. Therefore, Danish overseas commerce is facing the same fate as German commerce and is likely to be suspended. Danish merchants in this city are currently observing and awaiting news from their consulate. According to sources in the shipping industry:</p>
<p>Danish shipping companies in this city are represented by only one firm, Jebsen &amp; Co., and it is only a branch office. The head office is in Hong Kong. Apart from the ships operating on the Nanyang (Southeast Asia) route from Hong Kong, the branch office in this city only has two ships. One is the Machae Jebsen, with a deadweight of over 3,000 tons, and the other is the Gustav Diederichsen, with a deadweight of over 3,500 tons, operating on</p>
<p>China's coastal ports, represented by shipping companies such as Tong Wai Kee and Chap Seng. The Machae Jebsen loaded over 20,000 bags of foreign rice and corn in Shanghai on Monday this week (the 8th) to be transported to Yantai. The Gustav Diederichsen was originally scheduled to load miscellaneous grains in Shanghai today to sail to Longkou. However, due to the impact of the European situation, it was unable to leave today and is waiting for orders from the Hong Kong head office before deciding on its next course of action. The Machae Jebsen has now arrived in Yantai, and even if the cargo is unloaded, it is feared that it will not be able to go elsewhere and must obtain orders before leaving Yantai. According to related sources, the two ships can only temporarily dock in Shanghai and Yantai. Leaving Chinese ports would be even more dangerous. As for</p>
<p>Norwegian ships, there are also many rumors circulating about their future. According to a report from the Datong News Agency, the Hong Kong authorities have blocked ____. The Sksagkes, a fast ship of the Norwegian firm Shun Heng, is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Hong Kong tomorrow (the 13th). Furthermore, the ships of Hua Lun &amp; Co. operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo line are also operating as usual.</p>

<h3>Yunfei and Other Car Companies' Wage Dispute Resolved, Car Rental Prices Increased from Tomorrow, 2.7 Yuan Per 20 Minutes</h3>
<p>The drivers of Yunfei, Xiangsheng, Tailai, Yinse (Silver), and 40-Day car companies previously had a labor dispute over wage issues, which was well-known in society. After several rounds of mediation by Gu Bingyuan of the Industry Section of the Municipal Council, these companies have increased the wages and rice subsidies for the drivers as much as possible starting this month, and the storm has been calmed. This is fortunate for both parties. According to the companies, the purchase price of new cars is now expensive, and gasoline and spare parts have also increased in price. It has been decided to increase car rental prices to 2.7 yuan per 20 minutes starting on Saturday, the 13th of this month. The companies originally planned to implement the rent increase earlier, but because of the labor dispute ____. It is hoped that all sectors of society will not misunderstand. Although the wages of the drivers, etc., have been increased as much as possible, there is still a risk of being stretched thin under the current cost of living. It is hoped that the drivers will work diligently and that customers will frequently patronize them, so that both parties can benefit.</p>
<h3>Travel Industry's Additional Tax Implemented, Allowed to be Reduced at Any Time, Association Notifies Members to Pay with Resignation</h3>
<p>Regarding the Municipal Council's increase in license tax for Chinese-style apartments, it has replied to the Shanghai Travel Industry Association. After receiving the letter, the association immediately notified all members in the Public Concession, stating, "Regarding the notification, the Municipal Council has notified us that our fellow businesses (Chinese-style apartments) will be subject to a large increase in business license tax starting this summer. This association, considering the vital interests of our fellow businesses, has not only strongly argued with the Municipal Council but also sent letters to the Ratepayers' Meeting and the Chinese Councillors for assistance in reducing the burden. Subsequently, the Chinese Councillors investigated the Municipal Council's files and the reasons for this tax increase. According to ____ in the autumn of ____, the increase was already scheduled (approximately 70 to 50 percent). At that time, due to the sharp decline in business after the January 28th Shanghai Incident, coupled with the efforts of this association, the increase was reduced by half. However, it was stipulated that the full amount would still have to be paid in the 23rd year. Now, seven or eight years have passed. While the business of our fellow businesses has slightly improved, the Municipal Council's expenditures have increased daily, and its debt is piling up, making it impossible to reduce the tax. Recently, we received a letter from the Municipal Council stating, 'Your association's suggestion that the tax rate should be considered for reduction if business declines in the future is particularly appreciated.' After deliberation, the association believes that since the Municipal Council has agreed to consider reducing the tax rate in the event of business decline, it is still reasonable. We urge all fellow businesses to temporarily endure the pain and pay the tax according to the rate notified by the Municipal Council from now on. Do not ____."</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Complies with Ministry Order, Issues Wartime Allowance</h3>
<p>All tax police officers of Jiang ____ Customs previously submitted a joint request to the authorities, requesting an allowance during this extraordinary period due to the difficulty of making a living. The Ministry of Finance then telegraphed the Shanghai Customs to approve the request and increase the allowance appropriately. Now, in order to take care of the livelihoods of customs officers across the country, the Ministry of Finance has telegraphed all customs offices to issue a "wartime allowance" of 40 percent, which will be applied to all customs officers and police. It is understood that this allowance will be issued by Jianghai Customs on the 25th of this month. Those who receive a monthly salary of 100 yuan will receive an allowance of 40 yuan. Those above 100 yuan will receive 35 yuan, those above 200 yuan will receive 30 yuan, those above 300 yuan will receive 25 yuan, those above 400 yuan will receive 20 yuan, and those above 500 yuan will receive 15 yuan. The rest will be calculated accordingly.</p>
<h3>Fourth Phase of Price Stabilization Rice Sale to be Held in Two Weeks</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Price Stabilization Rice Committee decided to continue with the fourth phase of price stabilization rice sales at its tenth meeting, the committee scheduled another regular meeting at 3 PM tomorrow to discuss raising funds and finalizing the previous three phases of price stabilization rice sales. The date for the continuation of the price stabilization rice sales will be in two weeks, as various procedures need to be completed within this period. Regarding the fundraising method, it will be the same as the previous session, and various associations in this city will be convened again to solicit donations.</p>
<h3>German and Italian Restrictions Very Strict, Prohibiting Cash from Leaving the Country, Overseas Chinese Trying to Transfer Funds, Exchange Rates High, Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese returning from Europe have been unable to bring their savings out of the country since the outbreak of the European war, as governments in various countries have restricted overseas Chinese from carrying silver out of the country. According to returning overseas Chinese, most of those affected by the European war and returning to the country are from France, Germany, and Italy. Before the war, Germany and Italy had very strict restrictions on any overseas Chinese carrying silver out of the country. Germany only allowed each person to carry ____ marks. After the war, due to the control of wartime finance, the carrying of silver coins out of the country was prohibited. The same was true for Italy. Therefore, overseas Chinese returning after the war were unable to carry any expenses other than for the fare. The French government allowed each person to carry 500 francs, equivalent to just over 150 yuan in national currency. Recently, customs officials in Marseille have been conducting stricter checks on departing passengers, and even small items must be opened and examined to prevent money from being smuggled out. Furthermore, overseas Chinese are prohibited from purchasing remittances. Overseas Chinese residing in France, Germany, and Italy fear that the war will escalate and that their savings will become even more difficult to withdraw. They are all transferring their funds to countries such as Britain and Belgium in order to remit them back to the country at any time. However, the exchange rates are quite high, resulting in heavy losses.</p>
<h3>The Case of the Hidden Shareholder of Lao Zheng He, The Court Rules That There Are Indeed Share Rights, The Defendant Is Convicted of Perjury and Given a Suspended Sentence</h3>
<p>Xu Huijun from Shaoxing, residing at No. 5, Lane 31, Shanxi Road, worked at Lao Zheng He Dye Shop at No. 191, Rue Edward VII. In the fifth year of the Republic of China, the former shareholder of the dye shop was unwilling to continue operating it. Lu Tingjian, Wu Zhihua, and Wu Rongquan formed a partnership to take it over and issue shares. At that time, each partner contributed 1,000 yuan of capital. Because Lu's capital was insufficient, he invited Xu, Jiang Shangxian, and Xu Baochun to join Lu's name as hidden partners. After Lu took over the dye shop, there were annual surpluses. By the 20th year of the Republic of China, the capital had expanded to ____ yuan. Xu's attached 200 yuan</p>
<p>Hidden Share Rights</p>
<p>also increased to 2,000 yuan. However, the three apparent shareholders had been friends for many years and had not yet reached an agreement. Therefore, Xu and Lu had not signed a separate agreement. However, Lu was honest and trustworthy and paid Xu's dividends and bonuses over the years. Unexpectedly, Lu died of illness on the Mid-Autumn Festival of the 27th year. Lu's wife, Sun, and son, Yongnian, denied that Xu had hidden share rights. Xu then hired lawyers Yu Zhongluo, Shi Lin, and Chen Kunyuan to file a lawsuit in the civil court of the Second Special Court against Lu's wife and son, seeking confirmation of his share rights. The two defendants hired lawyer Gao Danhua to defend them,</p>
<p>Presenting Stock Certificates</p>
<p>stating that if the plaintiff did not have stock certificates, they could not be recognized as having hidden share rights. As a result, Judge Ma ruled, "Xu Huijun's hidden share rights under Lu Tingjian's name in Lao Zheng He Dye Shop are confirmed as two-tenths." However, Xu discovered while reviewing the files in this case that the stock certificates submitted by the two defendants were forged in collusion with their relative Jiang Shangxian (Yongnian's father-in-law). He immediately reported this information to the French Concession Police Department. After investigation by the head of the detective team, it was confirmed that the information was true. A</p>
<p>Forgery of Documents</p>
<p>public prosecution was filed against Lu Sun, Yongnian, and Jiang Shangxian in the Criminal Court. In the first instance, Judge Liao ruled that all three defendants were not guilty. The administrative authorities of the French Concession refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Criminal Court of the Third Branch of the High Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu, together with Judges Chen and Gu, concluded the trial and overturned the original verdict. Lu Sun and Lu Yongnian were each sentenced to two months of imprisonment for jointly forging private documents. Jiang Shangxian was sentenced to two months of imprisonment for perjury, all with a two-year suspended sentence.</p>
<h3>Arranged Marriage Reaches Stalemate, Matchmaker Sues for Advances, Proxy Handles Wedding Ring, Bride Refuses to Pay</h3>
<p>He Jingyuan, the owner of the Dongfang Beauty Art Gallery at No. ____69, Jing'an Temple Road, arranged for his daughter, Xingzhi, to marry the son of Jin Baozhi, a wealthy businessman from Yangzhou, through the introduction of Jin Keqing (manager of the Wu Gong Hotel) and Zhang Shouzhi on November 26th of last year. However, when the wedding date arrived, the matchmaker Zhang Shouzhi was far away in Jiangdu and unable to come, so he entrusted Liu Fenggao (owner of Bao Yung Ko Antique Gallery at No. 59, Jiangxi Road), the brother-in-law of He, to act as a proxy matchmaker. Because the wedding ring was not prepared at the time of the wedding, He asked Liu to handle it on his behalf. Liu then purchased a gold ring from Qiu Tianbao Silver Shop for 82.7 yuan. Later, on the wedding day, He Jingyuan haggled over the wedding gifts, clothing, and a 20,000 yuan post-wedding guarantee, refusing to let the bridal sedan proceed. Despite the mediation of matchmaker Jin Keqing and proxy matchmaker Liu Fenggao, He insisted on not giving in, while Jin Baozhi's side refused, claiming that the post-wedding guarantee was an unprecedented idea. This led to a stalemate. At that time, Liu made some unpleasant remarks, resulting in animosity between the brothers-in-law. As a result, He refused to pay the 82.7 yuan for the wedding ring advanced by Liu. Despite repeated requests, he refused to pay. Liu had no choice but to hire lawyer Sun Deji to file a lawsuit in the First Special Court against He, seeking recovery of the debt. Yesterday, Judge Gui Yu opened the court for trial and ordered a postponement for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Major Fire by Suzhou Creek Yesterday, Cotton Warehouses Burned Down, Losses Exceed One Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Gu Tiansheng Cotton Ginning Mill and Tianxiang Cotton Packing Factory, located at Nos. 2 to 30, Lane 1086, North Chengdu Road, along the Suzhou Creek in the Public Concession, were both owned by Gu Yongfu (62 years old) from Peidong. The factory had been in operation for many years. Because there was a large amount of cotton, it was insufficient to store it. Therefore, the company rented two large warehouses from Siemens nearby as storage warehouses. Unexpectedly, at 4 PM yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out on the second floor of the warehouses. In an instant, fierce flames soared into the sky, and the fire was raging, breaking through the roof and becoming uncontrollable. Although it was daytime, the fire was very bright. Because cotton is easily flammable, despite the efforts of Chinese and foreign firefighters to put out the fire, it was to no avail. The fire was not extinguished until midnight. When the fire was raging, the factory owner, Gu Yongfu, was so angry that he wanted to jump into the fire, but he was stopped by the workers. According to investigations, the loss of goods and buildings this time is estimated at 1 to 2 million yuan. It is reported that all of them are insured against fire. The factory suffered a fire last year, which also resulted in significant losses. Fortunately, the adjacent Changcheng Paper Mill was not affected. When the fire spread, the audience along the river on Guangfu Road in the Chinese Concession across the bank was like a wall. The Japanese Marine Corps specially dispatched troops and police with live ammunition to suppress the area near the Xinzha Road Bridge facing west, fearing an accident. The cause of the fire has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Dance Hall Manager Seriously Injured in Assault</h3>
<p>Sun Kangnian, 34 years old from Ningbo, is the manager of the Hong Kong Dance Hall in the Guangzhou Hotel on Hankou Road. At around 3 PM yesterday, he took Wu Mengdie, a dancer who had returned to Shanghai from the Xinsanhai Defense, to the Yangtze Hotel. He happened to meet his friend Chen Fuzi (formerly an inspector at the Dahua Dance Hall). Sun immediately went up to greet him, but Chen ignored him, which led to a quarrel. Shortly after, Chen went out and gathered several people who grabbed Kangnian and beat him severely, using weapons to break his right leg. The assailants then scattered. The injured man was taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Blackmailing Merchants, Two Criminals Arrested and Punished</h3>
<p>Sun Xinian, 22 years old from Jiangsu, was previously engaged in cotton yarn business. Therefore, he was familiar with the yarn industry and people in the "Consolidated Tax Bureau" on Jiujiang Road. After the outbreak of the war, Chinese industries were severely hit, allowing Japanese goods to take the opportunity to infiltrate and flood the market, especially cotton yarn. Because it was not easy to sell in the interior, it was mostly disguised, using the brand names of Chinese manufacturers to deceive customs and transport. Many yarn companies in Shanghai specialized in this business. Sun Xinian took advantage of the opportunity to blackmail these businesses. Last month, Sun blackmailed Bailey Cotton Yarn Company in the Hadong Building on Nanjing Road, initially demanding 1,000 yuan, which was later reduced to 500 yuan. He arranged to meet at Guanshengyuan on Nanjing Road on March 30th. Bailey reported this to the Laozha Police Station, which dispatched detective Shan Zhaoxian to wait. When Sun arrived, he engaged in negotiations, first handing over 200 yuan, promising to pay the remaining amount later. He then handed over 200 yuan in marked banknotes. When Sun received the money, he was arrested. His accomplice Dai Xianfang was also arrested. They were escorted to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, the court continued the interrogation. The police lawyer Peng Qiqi filed a lawsuit according to the law, stating that the defendants had committed many such acts, but the victims were unwilling to cause trouble, so they did not participate in the lawsuit. When questioned, the defendants evaded their guilt and hired a lawyer to defend them. Judge Dai reviewed the confession and sentenced Sun and Dai to six months of imprisonment each, with a three-year suspended sentence.</p>

The Black Man trademark has also been approved for registration by the Trademark Bureau and a registration certificate has been obtained.

The court accepted the statement and heard the case yesterday morning by Judge Zhu Chuzhe.

<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Provinces and Cities to Draft Guidelines for Instructing Graduates of Normal Schools</h3>
<p>(Chongqing, 11th) The Ministry of Education believes that how graduates of normal schools in various provinces and cities should serve after graduation urgently needs guidance from educational administrative organs in order to achieve practical results. The Ministry has recently ordered the education departments of various provinces and the Social Affairs Bureau of Chongqing City to draft guidelines for instructing graduates of normal schools within a limited time and submit them for review and implementation.</p>
<h3>Central Organization Assigns Personnel to Inspect School Party Affairs; Minister Chu Discusses Education and the Mission of Academia</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Air Mail) The Central Organization Department will invite several figures from the education and academic circles to inspect school party affairs in Chongqing, Chengdu, Guiyang, Kunming, and various places in the Northwest. The reporter believes that school party affairs have been inactive for a long time, and this move is of great significance. Therefore, he visited Minister Chu Chia-hua to inquire about the purpose of inspecting school party affairs. Minister Chu replied as follows: Our Party's revolution has now entered its most critical stage. Externally, we must wage a fierce and sustained war against Japanese imperialists; internally, we must engage in multifaceted construction and ideological unity. Ideological unity is the foundation for concentrating strength, and concentrated strength is the main factor for achieving victory. The education and academic circles, especially universities, have had a glorious history in the revolutionary process in the past. The decline of school party affairs in the past ten years or so is merely a respite after the revolutionary torrent of the past fifteen or sixteen years. I firmly believe that the education and academic circles are still a leading force in our Party's revolutionary strength. In the future, the enhancement of the entire national consciousness and moral cultivation will depend on the enlightenment and teachings of schools. For example, in the Franco-Prussian War, after Jena fell, Professor Fichte's ten lectures in Berlin became the driving force for the German national revival. The establishment of the University of Berlin also originated from this kind of thinking. However, although I believe that the education and academic circles of China today certainly have this kind of potential, it can only achieve its practical effect under the leadership of the Chinese Kuomintang. The purpose of our Party's leadership in the revolution is to restore the entire Chinese nation. Judging from the historical development of China, since the War of Resistance, it has entered an active and creative stage, realizing the determination of the entire Chinese nation's destiny with the blood of the entire Chinese nation, and laying the foundation for the boundless, prosperous, strong, healthy, and happy foundation of the Republic of China for all ages. Judging from the process of our Party's revolution, the National Congress will be held, and our Party's theory will enter a stage of more universal and practical application. Our Party's burden will be heavier than before, and the leaders of the education and academic circles, who carry on the past and open up the future, will also increase their responsibilities in establishing the atmosphere and enlightening future generations. This time, the Ministry has sent personnel to inspect party affairs in various schools to convey this mission, hoping that the education and academic circles will return and make greater contributions to the Chinese national revival movement.</p>
<h3>Chiang Meng-lin's Speech: General Situation of the Southwest Associated University; Rumors of Relocation Are Inaccurate</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) Chiang Meng-lin, President of Peking University, came to Hong Kong from Chongqing last week to represent the Ministry of Education at the annual meeting of the China Education Fund Board of Directors on the 15th of last month, and to pay condolences to the family of Cai Yuanpei. On the 5th of this month, the Peking University Alumni Association in Hong Kong held a banquet for Chiang at the Windsor Restaurant. The reporter met Chiang at the banquet and inquired about the impact of the Japanese army's interception of our country's customs duties on the Gengzi indemnity used to subsidize cultural undertakings, which was guaranteed by customs duties. According to him, the government uses the guarantee of the fund to borrow from the joint office of the four banks, Bank of China, Central Bank, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank, according to the budget of each school and cultural institution, which can be transferred without any impact. Regarding the relocation of the United University, Chiang said that the rumors circulating outside are completely inaccurate and may be caused by misinformation. Chiang continued to give a speech to the Peking University alumni on the general situation of the Southwest Associated University, saying that since moving to Kunming from Changsha the year before last, two-thirds of the United University's school buildings have been rented from the original sites of local public schools (originally, students were scattered in various places) and temples, etc., and the remaining one-third are newly built. There are more than 3,000 students in the whole school, but it can be increased to 4,000 in the next semester. There are more than 200 teachers. In recent years, a large number of middle school graduates from all over the country have gone to apply for the entrance examination, but the school is limited by the school and instruments, maps, etc., and cannot accommodate as many as possible, which is a pity. At present, the United University's expenses are more than 1.4 million yuan per year, and 70% is actually issued, so the school's financial situation is quite difficult. Recently, prices have risen sharply. Compared with the initial move to Kunming, the average price of various daily necessities has risen from 50 to 200 times, so the lives of all faculty, staff, and students are extremely difficult. Recently, due to the soaring price of rice, each dan of rice costs 105 yuan. Poor students and small staff members who only earn dozens of yuan a month simply cannot survive. In order to remedy this situation, the central government allocated 100,000 yuan and the provincial government allocated 50,000 yuan to organize a committee to handle relief work. The committee now stipulates that the price of rice for students is 22 yuan per dan, and the price of rice for faculty and staff is 60 yuan per dan. The remaining insufficient price of rice is subsidized by the committee. The school is also quite short of books, instruments, and other supplies, but it can still barely maintain. Recently, the school bought a part of the books, and Nankai University also transported a part of them, but there is still a rush to read them in the library. In terms of school management, the Standing Committee is organized to unify management, and the presidents of Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Nankai University attend. Recently, the organization has been expanded, so the three schools can be said to be completely cooperating. Even the students graduating this summer all call themselves United University. The discipline and spirit of the students are very good.</p>

<h3>Finance: Speculation Is Unpredictable; The Gold Market Changes Rapidly; Initial Fall Followed by Rise, Not Yet Returned to Balance</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot red-hot trading conditions were volatile, rising and falling alternately, with high and low prices seen. This was because people's hearts were floating and operators' 　ambitions were not firm. At the beginning of the morning, because the exchange rate returned to long, the foreign exchange rate was reported hard, and the gold price also fell. The opening 　was 5,590 yuan. Soon, securities firms entered the market to buy, and the market seemed to be turning up.

At this time, foreign exchange had heard of tightening, so the high price in the morning would be 5,600 　15 yuan.

Later, another bank vomited out, and the gold shop also sold, once returning 10 yuan, the bank issued 20 taels to the money 　industry, for 5,695 yuan.

The bank entered 20 taels to the gold shop, for 5,730 yuan. Then, because the rising wind could not avoid its sharpness, and the foreign exchange returned to balance, it caused profit-takers to exit, and quickly returned into the 5,700 yuan mark, falling back to 5,680 yuan.

A bag of large five-cent aluminum coins weighs 24 and 67/100 pounds. The pocket labels are all from the North Pole Company. The packing date is at the end of March, and some are in early April.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Weakness</h3>
<p>The foreign currency market yesterday was still in a state of agitation and uncertainty, and in the end, they all tended to fall. The British and American orders for pounds were still in great need, and the market price was very easy. In the afternoon, because the gold price fell sharply, it also followed the decline. British gold notes and other history, US dollar notes initially fell to 16 yuan, 6 jiao and 4 fen due to the rise in the price of pounds, and then rose to 16 yuan, 7 jiao and 4 fen, and then fell back to 16 yuan, 6 jiao and a half in the afternoon. After 1 o'clock, news about the British and Americans being favorable in the current election of the Public Concession Board of Directors was frequently reported, and it was also reported that the Chinese army was advancing rapidly towards northern Jiangxi, and was not far from Nanchang, so the selling atmosphere suddenly became strong, and the evening market fell to 16 yuan, 5 jiao and 5 fen. Hong Kong notes fell and then recovered slightly, French franc notes and Annam notes showed a very soft trend, Singapore notes and Dutch Luo, Fei, and Annam notes all tended to fall, Japanese gold notes were initially stable, and then tended to fall, and the evening market was 　yuan, 3 jiao and 3 fen, Korean notes were suddenly in heavy supply, and the market price suddenly tended to fall, and the evening market was yuan, zero jiao, 6 fen and 5 li, and the rest did not move.</p>
<h3>Securities: Foreign Stocks Rebound Actively, Domestic Bonds Fluctuate Irregularly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the securities grey market continued to be weak due to the depressed mood and many incidents, but the 　trend was still easing. As soon as there was a slight decline, someone would buy. It is heard that the Nanchang war is quite favorable, and the market price can be slightly recovered, but there will be no major changes. Many longs in the 20th are gradually coming out, which is a phenomenon that should occur after encountering a lottery. The 30th, etc. 　are still constantly absorbing. Yesterday, the type C once reached a high of 　50 yuan in the morning, but it immediately went down 　. People's hearts can be seen here. The selling atmosphere in the afternoon was even worse than in the morning, and each 　went slightly smaller again, but the longs and shorts were still quite equal, so the trend was stable. As a result, except for type D, which was slightly better by 5 fen, the rest continued to be smaller by about 1 or 2 jiao. The total number of transactions was estimated at about 1 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock transactions: 40 shares of Ning Shao Company shares were traded, and the price was 10 　yuan and 6 jiao.</p>
<p>Due to good news from the Norwegian and Swedish front lines, the stock 　of the public industry stock market should be excellent, and the 　of industrial stocks has made progress, and the trend is extremely active. The evening closing price 　is the best of the day. The soaring new peak of China Ken Zhi shares and Shanghai Silver Company shares is the second characteristic of yesterday. The former had a very large number of transactions, once seeing 22 yuan, and then fell back to 21 yuan due to profit-taking. At the close, the buyers regained the upper hand, and the price was 21 yuan, 25 bought in, and 75 sold out. Shanghai Silver Company was also very active, and at the close, 28 yuan and a half had buyers. International Yangzi and British United 　shares were actively traded, each buying in at 25 yuan, 75, 17 yuan and a half, and 42 yuan, 2 　at the close. Rubber stocks were very quiet, and the public's interest was almost entirely concentrated on industrial stocks.</p>
<h3>Meihua Real Estate Company Pays Funds</h3>
<p>Meihua Real Estate Company 　decided that after April 15, all holders of the company's investment securities and unsecured debtors can hold their respective securities or verified accounts, and collect them at the company at No. 290 Sichuan Road from 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. after the 15th of this month according to 8%</p>
<h3>Grains Rice Market Settled, Foreign Rice Arrives in a Constant Stream</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the rice market continued the weakness of the previous afternoon. The market was still bearish. Although wholesale merchants had no intention to sell, speculators were watching. Many retail investors recovered their funds, with prices dropping nearly one yuan. The low-grade foreign rice opened at 37.5 yuan. However, as the sales in the inland villages and towns picked up, the market turned tight again, and the prices rebounded by one yuan. No. 1 Saigon rice was priced at 43 yuan, fire-milled rice at 41.5 yuan to 41 yuan, and low-grade rice at 38.5 yuan. The market fluctuated for a long time until the close, with no significant changes. As a result, the closing prices were only two or three jiao higher than the previous session, which could only be described as a settlement. Glutinous rice remained flat from morning to noon. As for thick japonica rice and early rice, over 2,000 packages were transferred from Hongkou yesterday, and there were no significant fluctuations in the market. Old japonica rice remained at 40 yuan per dan. The asking price for early rice was as high as 40 yuan, medium grade at 39.5 yuan, and low grade at 39 yuan. The off-exchange transactions were said to be mediocre, similar to the previous day.</p>
<p>Foreign rice continued to arrive. Yesterday, the Taikoo Dockyard Company's Shandong vessel arrived in Shanghai, carrying 8,596 packages from Hong Kong. In addition, the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Yong Sheng vessel arrived at the port the day before yesterday (the 10th), also loaded with 1,384 packages of foreign rice from Hong Kong, with 454 packages to be transferred to Yantai and 7,625 packages to Tianjin. (Ancestor)</p>
<p>After the foreign rice market opened yesterday morning, due to the continuous price increases in recent days, there was a real lack of demand. The recent enthusiastic and active participants were mostly speculators and scalpers. Once prices rose and profits were made, they immediately took the opportunity to sell. Therefore, the selling pressure was extremely strong after the market opened, especially the April-May futures of No. 2 Saigon rice, which were sold the most, opening at 49.56 yuan. The market appeared fairly stable, and the large investors did not engage in hoarding due to the expansion of the European war and high gold prices. However, when prices were stable, it suddenly attracted inquiries from merchants and speculators. Moreover, as the overseas prices were not reduced, merchants refused to release their goods, and the market gradually rose, with strong buying interest. The April-May No. 2 Saigon rice rose to 50.02 yuan, and the transaction volume increased to 400. Currently, foreign rice is initially stable and then becomes popular, rising by about five or six jiao. No. 1 Saigon rice also rose to 42.8 yuan, and No. 2 rice to 40.03 yuan. Other types of rice also rose in unison. The total transaction volume of spot rice for the whole day was more than 70 packages.</p>
<h3>Flour Continues to be Firm, Wheat Market Stagnates</h3>
<p>Flour prices remain firm. The price of No. 1 flour mill settled at 13.8 yuan, and there were no official offers from buyers. As for the recovered goods, the sentiment was quite firm amidst the serious European situation and high gold prices. However, the sales of inland flour coming to Shanghai were inevitably slightly affected. It was reported that the old car brand initially opened at 13.41 yuan, and the afternoon opening price was 13.45 yuan. The Double Lion brand has also risen to 13 yuan. Foreign flour merchants slightly inquired, with prices at 13.78 yuan. The total transaction volume of various flours in the market continued to be over 10,000 packages.</p>
<p>Due to the thin inventory of wheat, there was some news of price increases. However, Chinese factories still had a demand, but they were unwilling to raise prices to buy, so the prices fell and could not rise, leading to both sides taking different paths and a de facto stagnation.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Spring Sales Period Shortened, Yarn Market Price Increases Moderate, Double Horse Brand More Than 500 Yuan Higher Than Last Year</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had been soaring in recent days, showed a slightly moderating trend yesterday. However, the general sentiment was still mostly bullish, so when the market dipped, many people eagerly bought in, thus supporting the current market price. However, it was found that at the end of last year, the futures price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 763 yuan, and it has now risen to 1,774 yuan. This kind of increase cannot be said to be not frightening. Moreover, the spring sales period is gradually diminishing, and the future changes are difficult to predict. The morning opening of yarn was slightly flat due to the lengthening of British and American exchange rates and the easing of the US exchange rate. The factory price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,245 yuan, and the spot price was 1,250 yuan. Later, the sentiment tightened slightly. It was heard that a certain yarn rose, and it was also affected, with the factory price rising to 1,258 yuan and the spot price to 1,263 yuan. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 2,040 packages were traded. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn increased by 3 yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn fell by 10 yuan. In addition, 285 pieces of spot yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today (the 12th), 165 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, and 10 pieces to Haikou. The quantities purchased by various merchants are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow merchants 1,400 Hong Kong 630</p>
<p>Ningbo 10 Total 2,040</p>
<h3>American and Indian Cotton Transactions Show Some Improvement</h3>
<p>Cotton transactions remain sluggish, but American and Indian cotton transactions show some improvement due to their cheap prices. The factories, except for Unified and Rongfeng factories, have a slight demand, while others are mediocre. The spot cotton transaction situation is listed below:</p>
<p>Three remaining bales 37.00 Unified purchased 24 pieces</p>
<p>White Luo Qu 225.00 Rongfeng purchased 500 pieces</p>
<p>Mittling 282.50 Fellow merchants purchased 100 pieces</p>
<p>Da Zhong Ji 240.00 Also purchased 100 pieces</p>
<p>Ping Guo 185.00 Also purchased 400 pieces</p>
<p>Ping Guo 18.00 Also purchased 400 pieces</p>
<p>Olmula 24.50 Also purchased 200 pieces</p>
<p>Grass bags 197.00 Also purchased 100 bags</p>
<p>Separately, regarding cotton market prices, the New York cotton market was quiet on the day, with a slight increase in the early morning due to purchases by some fellow traders, but it strengthened later due to short covering. As a result, the cotton price failed to rise due to the decline in Wall Street stock prices, so the closing price showed mixed ups and downs compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market yesterday fell due to sales by some European merchants and profit-taking by bulls. The Egyptian cotton market rose by fourteen or five pounds.</p>
<p>The spot trade of foreign cotton in Shanghai was always exceptionally brisk, all being transactions among fellow traders, while the factories were very quiet. Although there were many arrivals of American and Indian cotton, they were all for the factories. The Japanese were quite active in purchasing, mostly Brazilian cotton, as they were deeply concerned about the difficulties in Indian cotton arriving in Shanghai. The spot price of the cotton market yesterday, converted at an exchange rate of 6 yuan for US dollars, is as follows:</p>
<p>20-count American Mittling 23.25</p>
<p>20-count Another inferior grade 282.0</p>
<p>12-count Another 30.45</p>
<p>32-count Another inferior grade 310.00</p>
<p>42-count Another 314.90</p>
<p>42-count Another inferior grade 205.00</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Cotton Cloth Sales Thrive, Selling Prices Reach New Highs</h3>
<p>Domestic cloth The market opened steadily yesterday morning, but turned tight again at noon, with prices rising with each sale. As a result, 11, 14, and 16-pound coarse cloth rose by 5 jiao to 1 yuan per bolt, 9 and 13-pound cloth rose by 2 jiao to 5 jiao, and fine cloth and fine twill rose by 5 jiao to 1 yuan. Bleached and dyed cloth also rose by about 1 yuan. Actual sales in Zhejiang Province were strong, with over 400 pieces of Chengdu Dapeng Fugui fine cloth, Jardine Matheson coarse cloth, twill, and bleached cloth being traded. Merchants from Fujian, Guangdong, Anhui, and northern Jiangsu still had strong purchasing intentions, with 300 pieces of printed cloth, bleached cloth, pongee, and colored cloth being traded. Over 100,000 bolts of bleached and dyed grey cloth were handled on this street.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth In the morning market, the white goods market was flat and weak due to the decline in yarn prices. However, with fellow traders tightening the market and external transactions still strong, the rising trend continued and reached new highs. The closing price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 38.25 yuan, and Four Gentlemen's serge spot price rose to 1.155 yuan per yard.</p>
<p>Exports 50 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong today (the 12th), 70 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 25 pieces to Haikou, and 250 pieces to Haiphong.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Yellow Beans Fail to Rally</h3>
<p>The yellow bean market conditions yesterday showed a slightly tight trend, and transactions were slightly more active, so the sentiment was slightly optimistic and wanted to rally. However, as the outlets could not be concentrated, the market price was also difficult to push up. However, the situation of wanting to buy and wanting to sell fluctuated up and down. Yesterday, oil extraction factories, merchants, and hoarders in this street accounted for one-third of the sales, totaling the transaction of Bengbu beans, priced at 12.5 yuan. Chuzhou beans were priced at 20 yuan per dong, over 200 packages of Dingjia Prefecture beans were priced at 21.4 yuan, 300 packages of Qingdao beans were priced at 26.6 yuan, one cart of Nanjing beans was priced at 18.4 yuan, over 200 packages of Taihu beans were priced at 21.2 yuan, 100 packages of Yangzhou mountain yellow beans were priced at 17.7 yuan, and 200 packages of Chongming sand yellow beans were priced at 20.03 yuan. Fifty packages of Pinghu Du beans were priced at 21.8 yuan. Today, 2,000 packages of yellow beans will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods Tunxi Mushrooms Offer New Crop, Sichuan Preserved Vegetables See New High Prices</h3>
<p>Tunxi mushrooms, the highest grade among domestic products, have recently arrived one after another. The first batch of goods opened well yesterday, with the prices of flower mushrooms ranging from 918.9 yuan to 878.1 yuan, 628 yuan for medium grade, 615.8 yuan for large slices, and 464 yuan to 468.6 yuan and 489 yuan for plain grade.</p>
<p>Sichuan preserved vegetables have been lacking recent arrivals, and the market inventory is extremely tight, so the selling price has gradually increased. The market price yesterday reached 150 yuan, also a new high price.</p>
<h3>Metals Tinplate Calls for 200 Yuan</h3>
<p>Recently, the war in Northern Europe has been serious, and foreign exchange has fallen sharply. The asking prices for metal products have risen again. However, the sales of various outlets have been quiet. Merchants dare not purchase, so the market situation is extremely sluggish. Tinplate has a long history in Shanghai, and most of its sources are from the United States. Although British and Italian goods are also frequently seen in the market, the arrival of goods has suddenly felt tight since the outbreak of the European war. Currently, most of the circulating goods in the market are American goods. It has been found that not many have been sold off in recent days, so the asking prices have increased. Currently, Italian goods weighing 180 pounds are priced at 195 yuan per box, American goods weighing 180 pounds are sold at 200 yuan, Italian goods weighing 200 pounds are priced at 210 yuan, and American Zheng Hao goods weighing 200 pounds require 220 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal Indian Coal Remains Scarce</h3>
<p>Although the sales of Indian coal have been sluggish on this street recently, the European war has expanded, and there are concerns that the source will be cut off. Generally, fellow traders and speculative investors, seeing the changing environment, have spontaneously generated a hoarding mentality, buying and vying to purchase, and the market situation is gradually improving. The asking price for Kirk Grade coal by fellow traders has been 225 yuan, and the owners are still tightening the market and unwilling to easily sell. The shops on this street have not yet moved, and the price delivered to customers is 240 yuan per ton for coal and 230 yuan for coal dust.</p>

<h3>Old Newspaper Excerpts Sixty-Seven Years Ago (352)</h3>
<p>(From the Shun Pao, Twelfth Year of the Tongzhi Reign of the Deposed Qing Dynasty)</p>
<p>The Situation in Burma (2)</p>
<p>The Burmese King's use of a spear to kill ministers is akin to the emperor of India personally taking action. His disregard for national affairs resembles a ruler who indulges in lacquerware enjoyment. His fondness for licentious pleasures is like the last ruler of the Later Shu dynasty, taking his concubines into the Jingyang Palace well. Any one of these flaws is enough to lead to the downfall of a nation, let alone the Burmese King possessing all of them in one person, leaving opportunities for others to covet the throne. Burma has no strategic defenses, no reliable troops; what does he rely on that he does not fear, and thus indulges in such tyrannical actions? Ministers and close advisors are the foundation of a nation, those upon whom it relies. Respecting and cherishing them is what is meant by "Able men are bulwarks, princes are city walls; do not let the city crumble, nor be afraid of being alone." This is a universal truth throughout history. Even if ministers and close advisors are truly guilty of crimes worthy of punishment, their penalties should be discussed with all ministers. There should never be a case where the ruler of a country takes it upon himself to kill people as a display of power. Furthermore, the Burmese King does not kill to establish power, but kills for pleasure. This is even more cruel than Zhou's abandonment of the elderly and common people! The Western Jin dynasty, with its fratricidal strife, triggered the chaos of the Five Barbarian Tribes. The Northern Qi dynasty, with its widespread slaughter of the imperial clan, led to the humiliation of captivity. Throughout history, any dynasty that cuts off its branches and leaves will inevitably weaken its roots. The proverb says, "When the root is large and the branches small, it is secure." Does the Burmese King not consider this at all? Moreover, the British envoy stationed in Burma has repeatedly remonstrated, but the King refuses to listen. How blind and ignorant can he be? In recent times, countries that have treaties with other nations all have envoys stationed there to strengthen alliances, communicate intentions, learn about customs, and handle diplomatic affairs for their home countries. Remonstrating is not part of their duties. Yet the British envoy has remonstrated repeatedly, but the Burmese King still ignores him. The ministers of the Burmese court are cautiously protecting themselves, fearing they will not have enough time. There is definitely no one who will strongly remonstrate or argue with force. The Burmese King's cruelty will undoubtedly have no end. Alas! If he only becomes alarmed after encountering enemies and external threats, can Burma still be saved?</p>

<h3>Jesus and the Unemployed (2)</h3>
<p>In the parable cited today, although Jesus did not explicitly say so, it contains this principle. The vineyard owner said to the people standing on the street, "Why are you standing here idle all day?" They replied, "Because no one has hired us." If someone were to hire them, they would be willing to work all day. Jesus here is interpreting God's justice. People should also do this, but it is not seen in practice. What people do is the principle of equal value, that is, pay a small price and get a small amount of things. Our work is calculated in hours, days, or years, and our rewards are also calculated in the same way. But in God's justice, there is a more meaningful principle, which is to look at people first, not work. Those who are willing to work should not lack daily food. It is a person's duty to work, and we despise those who are idle and lazy. I agree with the principle of the Apostle Paul: those who do not work should not eat. In all levels of society, there are many people who should be sent to special institutions to receive training and develop their work habits. Society cannot support those who are strong and healthy but unwilling to work. But what about those who are willing to work but cannot find work? As mentioned earlier, it is a person's duty to work, then, we can further say that people should have the right to work. I wonder if society can be organized in such a way that everyone can get full-time work. I think even the most sophisticated social plan cannot fully achieve this, so it is best to let people take turns to rest, but first, we must find a way to enable them to get through this idle period. This is a reasonable conclusion, and the vineyard owner in this parable did just that. Society should also have this justice, so that honest workers, in times of idleness, will not be humiliated to seek and accept charitable alms, or become disabled due to prolonged idleness. I think all three parties should do their best to prepare in advance. First, the workers themselves must have self-esteem and prepare for a rainy day; second, the industrialists must have foresight and enable the workers to join in the preparation, and then happily return to work after the economic downturn has passed; third, is the rest of us. We, as consumers, should pay attention to justice, take care of unemployed workers, and have foresight to seek the health of the entire social structure and prevent the waste of national talent. Workers, the industrial system, and the country, working together as the basis for an unemployment insurance plan, can save us from the shame and sadness of future unemployment. By doing this, we are applying God's justice to our society. Therefore, for the sake of Christ's original intention, I ask you to support this unemployment insurance plan. (The End)</p>

<h3>Lessons of Speculation</h3>
<p>— Dao Ke</p>
<p>Learn from the previous mistake, and become wiser from one setback, gaining one experience and lesson. This time, the writer was influenced by colleagues engaged in speculative transactions, and without knowing my own limitations, I imitated my peers and boldly ventured into the black market to gamble by buying and selling US dollar bills. I knew beforehand that speculative transactions were improper and dangerous, but with a fluke mentality, I finally tried it.</p>
<p>The fact is this: many friends in the financial industry said to me, "The US exchange rate is only shrinking day by day, and it will never loosen. Maybe it will shrink from six yuan to five yuan and seven and a half cents, or five yuan and a half. Brother, don't miss it, it's time to go long!…" So, I racked my brains and tried every means to raise 200 yuan in legal currency as margin for trading 100 US dollar bills, and respectfully sent it to the securities firm in the black market. They immediately set up a trade for me, buying 100 US dollars at an exchange rate of 16 yuan and 25 cents. As usual, I had to pay 1625 yuan in legal currency. Because they collected the client's margin, the remaining amount was a loan, with a monthly interest rate of 1.5%, calculated daily. As for the commission for buying and selling, I gladly accepted it according to their business rules. That was near the end of March. In the blink of an eye, it was April 1st, and the US exchange rate did indeed shrink greatly, from 6 yuan and 125 cents to 6 yuan and 9375 cents, 6 yuan… until the middle, it even broke through the 6 yuan barrier, and changed to 5 yuan and 96875 cents… The US dollar bill price rose from 16 yuan and 30 cents to 35 cents… directly to a peak of 57 cents, 62 cents… At this time, I was secretly happy, thinking that I had already made a good profit of 37 cents very quickly, and I was still fantasizing that I could rise directly from 66 cents to 17 yuan, and then prepare to sell. Who knew that after the initial peak of 62 cents, it gradually fell suddenly! From 45 cents… all the way down to 25 cents, I still mistakenly believed in the subjective view that the US exchange rate would shrink greatly again, and waited foolishly for one day, two days, three days, four days… But the more I waited, the more rigid it became, and the US dollar bill market became smaller and smaller.</p>
<p>On the 8th, the opening morning was only at 10 cents, 15 cents, and then gradually retreated to 07 cents. I calculated the cost myself, (plus more than ten days of interest and commission) ah, oh no! One US dollar, oh no! One US dollar, is losing 30 cents. Wouldn't 100 US dollars have to touch more than 30 yuan? If I wait any longer, wouldn't half of the margin be sacrificed soon? So, I reluctantly cut my losses and sold, with the price being only 16 yuan and 08 cents. On the US dollar bill itself, I had to lose 17 yuan, plus a commission of 5 yuan, and interest of 8 or 9 yuan at 1.5%. In total, more than 20 yuan was deducted from the margin, which really left me speechless and eating bitter melon, with no place to complain. Spending more than 30 yuan to buy experience and lessons, this is the writer's motivation for writing this article, and my own regret. As the saying goes, "Worms in the pickle jar die in the pickle jar!" I sincerely advise friends who are addicted to speculation in the black market! Wake up quickly!</p>
<h3>Public Buses to Raise Fares Again</h3>
<p>— Zhi Zhi</p>
<p>British-owned public buses will increase fares again starting from the 15th. The reason announced by the company authority is: First, the increased import value of rubber tires and other parts. Second, the increased salaries of employees, which directly increases the company's expenses.</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, it is indeed a current factual matter, but we should understand that the soaring prices of various parts and tires for public buses are mainly due to the drastic shrinkage of foreign exchange. However, the current foreign exchange value is not as low as the worst period, and the foreign exchange value fluctuated most drastically after last year's summer vacation. Now, it has stabilized at a considerable level, maintaining between four shillings for the British pound and five or six yuan for the US dollar. Then, according to this situation, perhaps after waiting for a very short period of time, the value of imported goods from various countries will naturally and gradually decrease, so the only reason that the company authorities hold for increasing fares today will no longer exist.</p>
<p>Second, we think we have not yet forgotten that not long ago, the steelworkers, drivers, and ticket sellers of the public bus company once declared a strike because they felt that their usual treatment was not enough to maintain their lives and demanded an increase in subsidies. From this, it can be seen that the increase in employee salaries is still a recent event.</p>
<p>Moreover, we should observe the nature of the public bus business itself. Its original nature cannot be compared with those whose sole purpose is to make profits. I think the enlightened British public bus company authorities must be deeply aware of this. At a time when the livelihood of the citizens is worrying and it is not easy to live in Shanghai, it seems that the public bus company authorities' proposal to increase fares and burden the people is also an undesirable phenomenon.</p>
<p>Furthermore, let the writer add one more word: the heyday of the public bus business was actually after the "August 13th" Shanghai battle. Just look at how in the past year or two, due to the needs of the abnormal prosperity of Shanghai, the company has opened many new routes and added many new vehicles. This is a fact that everyone has witnessed.</p>
<p>In short, the public bus company's fare increase, after studying it from all aspects, is ultimately an inappropriate and unreasonable move. Therefore, I advise the company authorities not to only seek temporary profit, but to take into account the burden of the entire society, and after today's severe situation passes, to also follow others in immediately reducing and lowering fares to ensure the company's future business.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 22 News Spreads from Beyond the Horizon Sound Opinions, Universal Beliefs</p>
<p>He Liyu said, "Lover sister! You are always telling jokes. Even for an opera, two or three people cannot make up a company, let alone a newspaper office!" Zhu Airen said, "You don't know! That was during the war. You were in America, so you don't know about these things. The entire assets of the newspaper I'm talking about are only one load, not at all wrong. This load, and it's not a heavy load, just a light one. At either end of that load, one is a radio receiver, and the other is a box of ink printing machines, plus some newsprint and wax paper. Aren't they just two things, and neither is heavy? The so-called three-person cooperation means that one person is in charge of editing, which is to write down the important news received by the radio receiver. If you want to express an opinion, you can also make a short comment. One person is in charge of printing. He has to lay wax paper, write with a stylus, and then print it out sheet by sheet on the ink printing machine. One person is in charge of distribution. Some are distributed to various subscription locations, and some are posted on the wall to become a wall newspaper. The important parts of a newspaper office are these three items. Aren't three people taking responsibility? Moreover, the three people can also work together. When listening to the radio, the printing and distribution departments may be empty and can help him. When printing with the ink printing machine and writing on wax paper, the editing and distribution departments may be empty. When posting on the wall and distributing to subscription locations, the editing and printing departments are empty again. Can't the three people help each other? Moreover, there is one convenient point, this newspaper office is mobile. Unlike their magnificent buildings, seven or eight stories high, built in Shanghai, but confined to Shanghai. The newspaper can be transported elsewhere, but the newspaper office cannot be moved elsewhere. But they are different. If they are happy here today, and unhappy tomorrow, they can move elsewhere. A small sailing boat, or the entire property of the newspaper office, can be towed away. There is nothing more comfortable. So, today, after seeing this large-scale newspaper office, I thought of the difficulties and hardships of running a newspaper in China in the beginning." Wu Qunsu said, "The ancient Chinese book says: 'When released, it fills the universe; when rolled up, it retreats into secrecy.' I didn't expect that the newspaper business would be like this." Shao Huihua said, "Sister Qunsu is showing off her knowledge again. You said retreating into secrecy, but we have someone here who refuses to retreat into secrecy." Everyone was stunned and said, "Who are you talking about?" Shao Huihua said, "I'm talking about one of the brides sitting here today. When people are newly married, it's called a honeymoon, and they don't come out much, which is really called retreating into secrecy. But our Danyu sister is willing to join us as six people, which is really releasing it to the universe, refusing to retreat into secrecy." Qunsu said, "It's a pity that the honey is the honey of sweetness, not the secret of secrecy." Huihua said, "Oh! I read the wrong word! Punish me with a drink!" (262)</p>
<h3>Fair Price and Price Increase</h3>
<p>— Yi Peng</p>
<p>In front of the news that an eight-cent bowl of white rice has been improved to seven cents, and a fifty-cent plate of rice has been reduced to forty cents, I also saw a large headline of "Coal Briquettes Rise Again." I think the editor, when issuing these two news items, must have had some doubts about this contradictory phenomenon, right? And for us common people, this sudden feeling is really worth the four words "between laughter and tears."</p>
<p>It is worth our gratitude that the rice and restaurant industries have lowered prices due to the recent fall in rice prices. Since the prices that have jumped up with all sorts of excuses, we have never heard of them being reduced. Because of the heavy pursuit of profit, they have even raised prices again and again without even an "excuse," which has made people reach the point of "headache": The repeated rise in coal briquettes is one of them.</p>
<p>Forgive us for not understanding the inside story of "arrivals" and "water freight," etc., beyond what we read in the newspaper. However, after the price of coal briquettes rose after the Spring Festival, summarizing the news we read: there were appeals from the hot water industry; advertisements from the Coal Briquette Industry Association and holders of coal briquette warehouse receipts, mutually shirking responsibility; an open letter from small coal briquette merchants to Yu Qiaqing;… etc. From these news and advertisements, at least half of the inside story can be seen. Fortunately, what is gratifying is that a "fair sale" message followed. However, following this "fair sale" message, we cannot forget the petition to "request a reduction in water freight." Then, please connect it with yesterday's report of "another price increase," then we don't need to understand the "inside story" to be able to understand it like the back of our hand.</p>
<p>The current conclusion is: Fair price is a prelude to price increase; price increase uses fair price as a charge.</p>

<h3>Michelangelo Antonioni said: If There Were No Edison</h3>
<p>— Jing Yuan</p>
<p>——There Would Be No Movies in the World</p>
<p>The life of the world-famous American inventor Thomas Edison has now been filmed and put on the screen. In today's Hollywood, which is vying to shoot biographical films, the production of this film is undeniably welcome news. This famous biographical film by MGM is divided into two parts. The first half is "Young Edison," which chronicles Edison's childhood, with this year's film emperor Michelangelo Antonioni in the lead role. The second half is "Mature Edison," starring Spencer Tracy. Now the first half, "Young Edison," has been completed.</p>
<p>Michelangelo Antonioni most admires Edison and Henry Ford, and Edison's childhood mischief and activity are very suitable for his personality. Therefore, in this film, he not only gives full play to his best acting skills, but also vividly and perfectly portrays the various activities of Edison's childhood. In addition, with the supporting roles of George Bancroft, and Virginia Weidler, and Norman Taurog directing, success is naturally expected. In order to shoot this film, Michelangelo Antonioni no longer writes musical scores in his spare time. Every day, he tirelessly reads biographies about this great scientist, or practices Morse code or studies batteries. Therefore, when the film is completed, his knowledge of telegraphs, generators, electric lights, cement, storage batteries, streetcars, phonographs, telephones, etc., is much richer than before.</p>
<p>Many of the props in the film are relics from the life of the great scientist. The small red-tiled school where Edison studied as a child and the two-story house where Edison and his mother lived in the small town of Huron in 1860 were also copied after on-site investigations. A month before the start of filming, Michelangelo Antonioni traveled to the Edison's former residence in Greenfield Village, where many of the great scientist's relics from his life are preserved. At that time, Michelangelo Antonioni also visited Frances Zoll, the librarian of Greenfield Village Library. This old man was a good friend of Edison during his lifetime, and also the only person who personally witnessed Edison's first experiment with electric lighting. Michelangelo Antonioni heard many anecdotes about the great scientist's childhood from him, which further increased his interest and determination to shoot this film.</p>
<p>"If there were no Edison, there would be no movies in the world." Michelangelo Antonioni said, "So I must work hard to shoot this film, so that I can be worthy of the inventor of the film."</p>
<h3>A Talk About Li Lihua's Family Background</h3>
<p>— Shui Cao</p>
<p>In recent years, under the continuous excavation of newcomers by Yihua Company, they have finally encountered a very promising talent, her name is Li Lihua, a lotus flower just emerging from the water, who has been trained in opera troupes since childhood, and has very rich artistic talent and knowledge. Her past life is very similar to Yuan Meiyun, but her environment is better than Yuan Meiyun, so her future is even broader.</p>
<p>Do readers want to know Li Lihua's family background? It's very simple, her father is Li Guifang, a leading man who occupies a very important position in the old opera circle. Li Guifang's beautiful appearance has fascinated many Zhou Lang enthusiasts in the past. Li Lihua inherited her father's legacy and is even more beautiful and intelligent. Although she has not been with Yihua for a long time, she has already become like a crystal-clear treasure and is cherished by many people in Yihua Company. Li Pingqian quickly invited her to star in "Biography of Heroes," and the company executives are even more unwilling to be careless, and invited the only leading man of today, Mei Xi, to co-star with her. With her talent and experience, it should not be difficult for Li Lihua to achieve fame in one fell swoop.</p>

<h3>New Reports on Domestic Films</h3>
<p>— Hai Xing</p>
<p>Movie fans who love domestic films are very concerned about the movements of various production companies. The following brief report is the latest record.</p>
<p>(1) The China United Film Company, newly formed by Xinhua and Huacheng, has already completed and is urgently awaiting public release "Loyalty and Patriotism," starring Liu Qiong and Xia Xia, and "Loyalty and Righteousness for Thousands of Years," starring Wang Yuanlong and Wang Xianzai. The films about to be completed are "Xi Shi," "Yanmen Pass," starring Yuan Meiyun and Mei Xi, and "Mr. Wang Celebrates His Birthday," etc.</p>
<p>(2) Yihua's "The Cave of Silken Webs" (Seven Emotions) and "Red Lotus Temple" have long been completed. "Guanshiyin," personally written and directed by Yan Youxiang, starring Zhang Cuihong, Wang Yuanlong, and Ziwei, and "Wicked Daughter-in-Law," starring Mei Xi and Ziwei, are both nearing completion.</p>
<p>(3) In addition to "Hero in Troubled Times," currently showing at Jincheng, Guohua Company has also completed "The Romance of Su San," starring Zhou Xuan and Shu Shi, and "Li Amao and Dongfang Shuo."</p>
<p>(4) Minhua Company's "Confucius" has been carefully produced and has been completed. Director Fei Mu will then prepare "Empress Dowager Cixi" for joint production. In addition, "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" by Lianmei and "Huang Shihu" by Fuhua will be screened at Heguang and Xinguang today. Yan Heming's fashion colorful film "Happy Enemies" is waiting to see the peach blossoms and green willows again, and one more outdoor scene can be completed.</p>

<h3>After Watching "Working Women"</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>In today's society, where the feudal male-centered system still remains, the general female profession is not a "beautiful decoration" or "vase." This playful and insulting name is the best proof. Moreover, some institutions even grandly regard "married women" as an exception.</p>
<p>Shi Huafu's "Working Women" is to point out this unreasonable phenomenon. He adopts a comedic form to satirize those "selfish people" wearing masks, and even strengthens their sins from the side, such as relying on "status" to "pursue" female employees, and even engaging in corruption and private gain. However, in the end, "Ladies and gentlemen, you have awakened me today." After the masks are torn off, the "director," who still expresses his dignity with a trumped-up charge of "conspiracy," will not wake up in this "sneeze." This is the author's magnanimity.</p>
<p>The whole play is divided into four acts. The humor of the dialogue and the beauty of the structure make the whole play flow smoothly in a humorous atmosphere.</p>
<p>The directing technique is quite close to the style of American movies, such as throwing flower vases, female preparation's sending tea, and the director's "bragging" in front of the curtain, all of which strengthen the success of this comedy.</p>
<p>In terms of actors, there is a lack of group support. For example, the nephew in the third act seems to be a prominent one in the whole. Therefore, his exaggerated movements that should be in the comedy are too much.</p>
<p>At a time when costume dramas have entered a fixed period, the emergence of this comedy has opened up a new path for our playwrights to some extent.</p>
<h3>Theatrical News</h3>
<p>— Shanghai</p>
<p>Zhou Yihua, the former stage manager of the Carlton Theatre, initiated a large-scale charity performance at the end of the month to aid the war-stricken refugees of his hometown Shaoxing. This initiative involves cooperation between amateur and professional performers. He has already obtained the agreement of backstage manager Zhou Xinfang, and it has been decided to hold two evening performances. Ticket prices will be sold for a maximum of three yuan, and the repertoire is under discussion.</p>
<p>Female impersonator Wang Huichan performed at the Carlton Theatre the night before last, co-starring in "Yu Tang Chun" with Gao Baisui, Wang Zhongping, and Ge Cijiang. She went backstage at seven o'clock and proceeded directly to the dressing room shared by Jin Suwen, Zhang Huicong, and Yang Bijun to prepare for the performance, without performing the ritual of burning incense and paying respects to the patron deity. Yuan Meiyun and Huichan are relatives, so she also went to the dressing room to take care of everything.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Star Peking Opera Troupe invited the newly engaged actors Wang Junchen, Qian Fulu, Zhang Yanxia, Yan Chunlou, and Li Youfen, a group of five, to travel to the Philippines. They departed yesterday aboard the Java liner "Tjisaakana". Performers and movie stars alike came to the dock to see them off, attracting considerable public attention.</p>
<p>The Chunming Opera Troupe, co-founded by Wang Xichun and An Shuyuan, except for Xichun and her daughter, the entire company returned to Shanghai on the Shandong steamer the day before yesterday. Xichun and her daughter are scheduled to return by ship on the ninth, and it is said that they may arrive today.</p>
