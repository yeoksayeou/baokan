<p>社評</p>
<h3>美國堅定政策之實行</h3>
<p>美國總統羅斯福氏於前日宣吿，軍用油鐵四種須經國務院發給特別照會，始得出口；同時，航務委員會不准美國運油船加入日本航綫。美國論者，咸謂日德義三國將最受影響，或謂美國茲已開始揮動其經濟武器，或謂美國今已對日伸其經濟巨拳。日本方面亦承認將受重大影響，且以此爲對於日本一極重大之事。前日何日？七月廿五，距美國宣告廢止美日商約，恰爲一年紀念，距美日商約實行失效，恰足半年。循此歲月，覘知美國遠東政策如何步調鏗鏘！</p>
<p>美國之遠東政策，長處在於把握之堅定，弱點在於運用之迂緩。世界各方之於美國遠東政策，受其惠者或鑒於迂緩而憂疑失望，爲所制者或蔑其迂緩而希圖僥倖；是皆不察其政策堅定，皆誤也。原遠東紛爭爲太平洋問題中之一環。美國之於太平洋，其國力總和洵視任何他國爲優越；以美國現在之國力，擴展龐大之海軍，既爲任何他國所急起直追而望塵莫及；更假時日，美國對於汎美會議收穫切實成就之後，其勢力允莫得與之爭衡，其政策必爲決定一切之因素。此無他。政策以公道與自由爲本者，本質上宜得最後成功，而美國實力固足以推行其政策耳。</p>
<p>美國政策如彼，日本侵略如此，其間對立之深刻而尖銳，無待煩言，所未然者，不可遽爾視同短兵相接之程度。溯自去年廢棄商約，乃至今日取締四種軍用油鐵之出口，此其方式爲美國運用政策至是而漸進一步，此其性質則爲美國運用政策漸次入於務期有效之階段。是以即在最近將來，誘發何種頃堪注意之反應，劇有其可能。雖然，漫漫長夜，終必黎明，則有未許期之太急者。日本作戰所需碎鐵，取給於美國佔百分之九十，汽油之購自美國者年値美金一千萬圓左右，航空馬達所用各種精油允非仰求於美國不可：及今美國取締出口，使日本蒙受極大影響，此雖在日本方面亦情見乎辭，絕不諱言。自此之後，日本軍械必有不能補充之一日，日本空軍必有不能起飛之一日；亦即日本終爲美國遠東政策下之經濟制裁所制，不復能維持其侵略。然至目前爲止，日本存鐵幾何，存油幾何？自今日以迄存鐵存油吿罄之日，尙得設法目其國內外補充油鐵幾何？雖曰數量必然有限，亦未可估量太低。故美國禁運油鐵後，日本猶得維持其相當期間之軍事侵略行動，乃屬當然之觀察。所不可知者，日本必待計窮力竭，至最後一滴血，最後一寸鐵，然後放棄侵略歟？抑猶多方挣扎，不恤促成何種新局面歟？抑及時省悟，幡然改圖歟？此三種可能，有待日本自行抉擇；不自抉擇，則在美國堅定政策，與中國決心抗戰之間，亦自有終使日本不得不走之末路在焉日本近衛此次再任閣揆，頗見自歛鋒芒，所發表片段之政見，輒留盤旋餘地。顧以吾人觀察，內閣政策自留盤旋餘地，其事易，抑亦僅內閣自爲計而已，國家大計求其能發能收，其事難，此實國運所繫也。日本自侵華之後，對美國顧忌日深；最初視美國權益如無物、對美國一九三八年底所提抗議於不理；嗣經美國宣告廢棄商約，猶以爲可使美國態度轉變，希圖續訂商約；及至美國格魯大使以演說作剴切之忠吿，不旋踵而商約實行失效，始知美國政策之堅定；然數日之前，猶望美國不作新舉動，以爲在美國總統改選之前，尙得恣所欲爲；吾人前既論之，知其不然，而今果又實行取締油鐵。美國迂緩，而日本不知善用　緩所予之時機；此非日人之癡　，其掌政者力量氣魄不能控制國家大計，斯明知必須　然改圖，放棄侵略，而仍徘徊不知所　；坐是因循，行見必有爲美國堅定之政策所制，而不克自維其體面之一日，是亦大可　　。</p>

<h3>德國警察獨裁者希墨萊</h3>
<p>英國政府當局久以爲德國內部會起不滿和革命，去推翻希特勒的獨裁政治的。更且有人以爲希特勒兵力所壓制的各國人民會發生叛變的。因此之故，德國進行長期戰爭會使該國民心渙散，最後使希特勒重蹈威廉二世的覆轍的。</p>
<p>這些幻想，過去旣已失望，將來亦必難以見諸事實，因爲德國有個才智出衆，禀性殘忍的人在。這僩人便是獨攬警權，指揮黨軍的希墨萊（Heinrich　Himmler）。他所手創的警察，規模之大，可謂空前未有。這種警察曾經幫助希特勒崛起秉政，破獲種種陰謀，且在希特勒這次征略歐洲的戰爭中，隨軍前進，用暴力壓制各地民衆的反抗。</p>
<p>希墨萊一身兼任國社黨保衛隊總指揮，德國警察總長，政治警察（Gestapo）總監等職。他對於希特勒的任務，與一百五十年前法國警務部長孚熙之於拿破崙相同，不過希墨萊手段的毒辣和效力的偉大却非一百五十年前所及了。</p>
<p>在希特勒輔弼之中，希墨萊最不爲人注意。他現年四十，望之如德國省立學校校長。中等身材，架夾鼻眼鏡，不宜戴鋼盔穿制服。他口才遲鈍，迫不得已，始發演說。柏林要人重視社交，但希墨萊一入社交塲，則有窘迫之感。</p>
<p>希特勒，戈林，郭倍爾都已興建華屋，惟希墨萊仍偕妻女居住柏林郊外簡陋小築，其夫人係巴伐里亞農家女，不喜喚奴使婢，烹飪家務，大多親自操作。希墨萊每日工作達十小時，得暇恒逗其十齡愛女葛特侖爲嬉。</p>
<p>猶憶十五年前，國社黨要人在慕尼克啤酒館圍坐一桌，時希特勒正在監禁中，會務因由希特勒的親信史萊轍代爲主持。希墨萊也在塲，史萊轍演講國社主義時，一手搭着希墨萊的肩頭說，「拿我的秘書—溫文的希墨萊爲例，他辦事澈底。他對於計算數字和組織，腦力驚人。不過他在革命運動中不會前進。他太溫和了，思想和外表，都像一位會計。」那個溫和約希墨萊眼珠轉動，微笑不發一言。</p>
<p>可是在一九三四年六月某夜，史萊轍和幾百個老黨員都被希墨萊的所指揮的黨軍，亂槍擊斃，這才證明看錯希墨萊了。實際上可說德國全部人民都看錯他了，溫文的希墨萊實際上蘊藏着鐵的意志，他的權力僅次於希特勒而已。</p>
<p>希墨萊所統率的國社黨保衛隊，共有德國優秀靑年四十五萬人，訓練精良，武裝全部機械化，此種保衛隊原係黨軍的一種精銳部隊，曾擔任保衛希特勒等要人守衛集中營，鎮壓內亂等任務。希墨萊已把它改編爲正規軍，戰車砲隊與空軍俱備，進攻奥地利，捷克，波蘭，丹麥，挪威，荷蘭，比利時，諸役，都是這種軍隊擔任先鋒。</p>
<p>西墨萊近影</p>
<p>用歐洲歷史上無與倫比的大屠殺和强迫移居，來「鞏固」陸軍佔領區域的，也是這種軍隊。希墨萊擔任政治警察總監已歷七年，祇聽命於希特勒一人。他可以不經普通法律手續逮捕任何人，押入集中營或判處死刑。其部下的特務員二千五百人，都在特殊學校中受過政治工作訓練。他的助手海特列克（Reinhard　Heydrich），面目猙獰，膚色黧黑，素以狡獪殘暴著稱。德國全境商店，辨公處，工廠，旅館，餐室，大學，和陸海空三軍中，均佈有大規模的間謀網，隨時從事偵察。</p>
<p>各地政治警察局所接情報很多，其中有關係的都轉送柏林總部。那　有二百個辦事員專司整理，和分類工作。這種政治警察裝有特別電話機，偷聽消息。重要事變發生時，他們進行偵查，權力殆無限止，但擔任逮捕工作的都是保　隊</p>
<p>七年以來，德人被政治警察盤問後押入集中營的，約有一百萬人，其中轉瞬喪生的不計其數。</p>
<p>集中營也是希墨萊所創立，專門拘禁猶太人和共產黨員。但創立以來，很多國社黨員因發言不愼，而被拘禁的也不在少數。</p>
<p>希墨萊最引以爲榮的，便是政治警察局的國外股。該股特務員五千人，在國外監視德僑和外界的一切關係，並陰謀顚覆外國政府。德國併呑奥捷前數月，這股特務員，已在德國使館，領事館和「旅行社」中秘密工作。奧捷政府傾覆後二十四小時內，各該國許多反國社黨重要人物，盡遭覊禁，卽係若輩所爲。他們曾在波蘭破壞交通綫，在挪威幾將國王哈康架去。德軍重視的「第五縱隊」便是他們佈置的。</p>
<p>希墨萊另一種重要任務便是保護希特勒本人的安全，希特勒衛隊，是三千個身材高大，絕對服從的保護隊員組織的。這三千人都受過正式軍事訓練。其黑色制服，縫製精美，也許是世上最神氣的隊伍。希特勒在貝許德斯加登山居時，有三百人擔任保護，在柏林時，有一百人守衛在總理府四週，其餘二千六百人駐在近郊里克透斐爾特地方富麗營房，一召卽到。希特勒每次到奧捷時，他們須確保所經過的道路安全無處，希特勒當衆露面時，他們須密密地圍着四週。凡是希特勒週圍的一舉一動，都逃不出這些　隊，銳利的目光</p>
<p>希墨萊即有政治警察爲其耳目，並有保衛隊爲其爪牙，他在政治上勢力自然極大。國社黨最高黨員的弱點和劣跡也有落入希墨萊手中的。自羅埃姆以至弗利熙將軍等要人都因反對他而被殺。希墨萊曾打倒陸軍部長一人和參謀長兩人，希特勒閣員中，有八僩人穿保衛隊制服，戈林和郭培爾等人，在希墨萊面前，百事審愼。卽希特勒也須依仗他的勢力。</p>
<p>希墨萊生於巴　里亞阿爾卑斯山麓美麗的康斯坦湖畔一個名叫林度的幽靜小村中。他的父親是個受人尊重的學監和虔誠的天主敎徒，曾希望希墨萊繼承其業。這種希望被上次世界大戰打銷了。希墨萊在十七歲時，便投人巴伐里亞步兵，擔任的却是文書工作。戰後，希墨萊竭力反對當時統治巴伐里亞的共產　。　在慕尼克加入國社黨，被希特勒的言辭和思想所麻醉。</p>
<p>當時國社黨員集會時，常遭共產黨員投石擊散希特勒使想到組織特別保　隊，各持木棍，逐散搗亂份子，這便是保衛隊的由來。希墨萊旋亦加人這種保衛隊，至一九二七年升任副總指揮，便仗其獨長的澈底手段，卒將毫無組織的粗漢，練成最嚴密的團體。</p>
<p>至一九二九年，希墨萊升任保衛隊總指揮，已有訓練嚴格，武器精良的隊員十餘萬人</p>
<p>同時黨軍中另外一種部隊叫做衝鋒隊的也已擴充到百二十萬人，隊員大半出身襤褸，紀律全無，旣不可靠，指揮也不　。總指揮羅　姆野心甚大。希特勒即與羅　姆的後臺老關萊茵工業家和陸軍將領商妥，並與希墨萊戈林計議解決他的辯法。保　隊一九三四年六月三十日夜間出動，　晨，衝鋒隊重要人物即被一網打</p>
<p>羅　姆即死，衝鋒隊瓦解，保　隊和政治警察使成希特勒政權的台柱。希特勒並使戈林放棄普魯士警察總長之職，希墨萊便被任爲德意志全國警察獨裁者了。（節　CurrentHistory）</p>

<h3>糧食　民食困難中之快事　米價奔瀉若決河堤　存五十餘萬路貨二十餘萬　新到一萬五千績到數尚客觀</h3>
<p>現洋米跌風、昨日愈烈、一路直瀉、勢若奔流決堤、在民食艱難中、誠快事也、統計先後續落二三元之巨、除高檔洋米尙在五十元外、餘他中下段貨悉巳跌進大關、由於棧存豐足、不下五十餘萬包、及有廿萬包途貨、亦將次第到達、買方不買、賣方欲賣不得、成交旣晞、各貨行情跌得再接再厲一無生氣、若一號陳西貢收盤已僅五十二元半、現米二號西貢小至四十六元、二號暹邏開價四十八元三角、亦步小至四十六元、最爲疲弱無神、蓋目下大批定貨湧到者均係二號貢暹米也、此價比之月初最高價六十五六元、則有二十元及十九元之慘落、其他各米均小去十五元以上、不獨跌過米商定價、卽以目下產價論亦相差五六元至七八元、此次米價反動在跌實出乎一般意料之外、路貨尙有二船暹米未到、已到零整併計約二十萬包、以貨價計當有千萬元之鉅、而新到各批尙須付款提現、故路貨允比現貨爲軟、上月二十六號裝開價立小一元爲五十八元、旋乃拾級下游、小至五十六元半、最後五十六元尙無人接收、乃小去三元尙未能立住也、前到原包開五十六元七角後亦，人再問、惟回籠交易出入兩活成交有五六百噸、現祇四千包、</p>
<p>洋米不斷運來、昨日又有太古公司慶元輸到滬、自香港裝來一萬零八百二十六包、停靠浦東本行碼頭起卸、又怡和洋行阜生輪亦是昨晨抵埠、由香港裝四千三百四十包、停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、另有一百十包、原定運往烟台、並在本市又加裝三百二十八包運烟台、洋米不日尙有大批到埠、（祖）</p>
<p>粳糯國米到貨雖疏、但以市面大局已頽、洋米一再猛甩、暗盤亦一致衰落、所開各價、較前亦創二元有奇、常幫淸粳鮮特六十五元半、六十五元、無錫淸粳六十四元、常州蘇崑粳六十二三元、次至宿五十八元左右、薄稻未開、南港斛早五十六七元、糯米金溧貨六十一元左右、常丹貨五十八九元、香港白元未開云、</p>
<h3>粉麥交易互持　終爲價格太高</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨交易頗爲淸淡、因値週末之期、本客進胃均懈、木街方面、以廠盤雖經改爲五角、尙嫌高昂、客銷則以當地旣定洋粉、更被廉價日粉之傾銷、需要益見呆頓、故昨日二號粉正牌客盤降至十七元內、尙乏受主、至本街批價、則仍爲十五元五角、如今後木麥收量加增、卽有續降之可能、其他日廠粉鳳凰牌等、自連日跌價動銷後、轉口客幫亦頗垂靑、聞回籠貨已有扳價之意、市面正在檳持中、</p>
<p>小麥　昨因內地產價連日報小元許、滬市存到漸充、廠方趁此頻頻折價、而貨主則以前到各貨、成木高昂、尙不願一再貶削、更値週末之期、買賣咸有擯持狀態、惟在目下米價粉價步落聲中、恐市面終難立足、結果僅華廠收進蘇崑麥一千包左右、價均爲廿一元半、</p>
<h3>金融　外匯期貨　較有收買</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美匯暗市、靜中微現軟化、此因外行有利吃胃頗旺、籌碼供給稍遜於求、價遂略緊、惟環境尙無顯著變動、扒風一時難起、而投機家對於遠期搜購、甚爲積極、故走勢趨緊較易、本日現美匯九時三刻後、卽吿六元〇九三七五、先令一度見三辦士八七五、惟午收仍平、結果三辦士八九〇六二五、美匯六元〇九三七五、較前收英美各軟〇一五六二五與〇三一二五、期貨亦相彷彿、</p>
<p>英美匯稍見緊縮</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近回升一八七五、遠漲〇六二五、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美不動、對滬亦平、對法無市、美對英長一分半、對滬小三分、對法無市、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士八九〇六二五、美匯六元一二五、較之上日晚收、美平英緊〇一五六二五、乃匯兌略回升之故、開後日行首來售出、但匯雙有利均　吸收之心、致初况尙平、計做開本月份美匯六元一二五、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉復增百分之一·二五、此後雖美行亦來吐塞、但有利吃胃頗健、故價微吿軟化、計美行賣與有利本月份美匯退達六元〇九三七五、惟遠期缺乏變動、時華商投機家進英行麥加利八月份美匯六元〇六二五、又有利入沙遜同月美匯亦爲六元〇六二五、聞先令最軟價現貨曾見三辦士八七五、而迄收盤價仍回平、美匯亦甚穩定、計英金三辦士八九〇六二五、美匯六元〇九三七五、八月份英金三辦士八七五、美匯六元〇三一二五、午後週六無市、</p>
<p>一周匯市波動微</p>
<p>查本週匯市、波動範圍愈見轉小、英金是〇·○六二五、美金是〇、○九三七五、英匯變動向來較緩、如前週不過是卅二份之三而已、美匯則因隨美英匯率變化、變動較急、如前週尙爲卅二份之十五、全週外匯的趨勢、英匯微微地上升、美匯除週六收盤轉緊外、最高悉止於六元又卅二份之五、收盤則站於六元又卅二分之三、現貨及七月期行市與八月期的差額、全週英匯是六十四份之一、美匯是十六份之一、</p>
<p>香港匯價少變動</p>
<p>香港廿七日（週六電）、今晨匯市開盤平靜、英美日各匯均無變動、（美匯昨收仍縮至廿三元半、）申匯現貨微降半元、爲三百八十二元、十時十五分申匯現貨回升半元、爲三百八十二元半、十一時三十分告平、各匯概無榮辱、下午週六無市、</p>
<p>天津市況亦呆</p>
<p>天津廿七日（週六）電、今農市開盤吿平、英美及申匯均無上落、僅「聯鈔」暗盤獨昂一元二角半、爲九十三元半、</p>
<h3>金市所漲甚微</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、漲跌於五千三百元與三百五十元之間、論人心堪稱堅定、出而復進、興緻頗濃、且匯市略報軟化、賣風相當消殺、初開僅五千三百二十元、且錢兌業金號領銜拋塞、又撳低二十元、爲五千三百元低盤、嗣則以上兩帮忽轉手復進、價乃回升至五千三百五十元、結果以浮多乘高了結、退逮五千三百三十二元爲收盤價、較上日軋漲四元、午後週六無市、半天交易約近千兩、銀樓飾金未動、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>赤軋大四元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以滙兌報長、人心略疲、開時錢兌業首來賣出、卽被撳小八元、錢兌業出證券帮三十兩、爲五千三百二十元、繼因賣者漸多、金號帮亦跟之吐塞、遂冉做低二十元、錢兌業出銀號等數十兩、遜爲五千三百元、但斯時　價買戶頗旺、跌風頓阻、且不久銀號帮忽來狂拖、加之錢兌業止塞轉買、原因外滙微緊、未幾竟漲起五十元、銀號進金號三十兩、爲五千三百五十元、不意此後買戶减少、價復下挫、且津帮與浮多均有吐出、近午曾退至五千三百二十三元、後滙市吿軟、銀號帮重來搜入、遂再提升數元、銀號進同業二十兩、爲五千三百三十二元、作午收價、結果比上日軋大四元、半天五十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金未見掛高</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、未有變動、大同行仍懸五百五十元原價、新同行與上價相仿、收進减低三十元允緊、</p>
<h3>外幣大都報漲</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市況、　赤跌後又漲、英美金鎊故赤終張五角、英金票需要未减、市價續漲二角、美金票以黑市美滙趨縮、一度高至十六元四角二分、卒爲十六元四角、比上日續漲五分、香港票需要忽殷、市價挺漲、日金票微漲一釐、晚市爲一元二角二分六釐、朝鮮票繼續挺漲、晚市高至一元零八分、</p>
<h3>四行儲蓄會員紅利</h3>
<p>四行儲蓄會定期儲蓄、除保息七厘外、再分紅利、帳略每半年公佈一次、茲聞今年上半年決算、盈餘達三十五萬六千餘元、會員紅利仍爲一厘二毫云、</p>
<h3>紗花　多頭數作　紗價回昂　雙馬到九百五十六元</h3>
<p>盤旋多日之紗市、昨已顯著轉機回好之象、此因市上又有利多謠言、一般多頭鑒於市面久無動靜、頗有做作之舉、同時實際交易、香港方面雖無巨量發展、然零星採辦、尙屬不少、所以大家稍買幾包、檯面稍帶緊狀、市面卽見回昂、總之市况徘徊甚久、大有靜極思動之勢、因存貨尙充足、前途恐無飛騰之力也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、市場入氣略帶平穩之象、但搶帽子之輩、多數心思平庸、故成交不旺、開價爲九百四十元、詎料此價一開、賣者殊鮮、某豐號復來收進、同時香港幫現銷不弱、人心一緊、又聞匯票微緊、多頭氣勢有勁、徐徐上升至九百五十六元收盤、查半日成交統計二千五百八十包、行情二十支雙馬漲二十元、今日有紗二百五十件運暹羅、一千七百十四件運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>同行一、八三〇香港六九○內地六○統計二、五八〇</p>
<h3>棉市依然靜寂　印棉到五千二百件</h3>
<p>現　交易稍形活絡、但廠方額子採辯、尚未發展、不過人心略帝堅昂、因外棉市盤亦在徘徊之境、致手貨心思安定、同時紗市上升、原棉隨之穩靜、火機花同行成交三百包、價一百五十三元、印棉二百〇五元、成交三百件、棧交、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日晨初先因缺乏重要之買戶、及棉區氣候報吿轉好說、加之現貨需要减少、結果收盤價格較之上日跌落三五磅音、印度棉市昨日因投機者之購買、連同預測漲十羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、全日靜　　常、各方　抱觀望態度、除一二廠家略有購配缺額花、惟爲數極微也、市上存底不豐、允以長纖維者爲最、日方廠商靜寂、一般預料、交易將在下月矣、</p>
<p>印棉大批到滬、前日鴨家公司希里拉號輪抵滬、由喀爾喀塔裝來五千二百件、停靠浦東其昌棧起卸、</p>
<h3>證劵　統甲最爲鋒俏</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨市仍轉堅俏、客戶收貨者漸感典趣、雖數目不鉅、而在此狹窄之檯面已足以振奮人心、甲種行市最爲鋒俏、昨又穿出三元、與十六日最高價祗差一些、其他各種與最近高價相差較多、故帶息期內行市殊不易回落、昨日上午仁昌同康吸收較多、三十五號及恒孚聯益均有吸收、樂茂稍有出籠、鴻大出乙入丙、大通潤利及久豐均有賣出、但市價仍甚堅挺、午後聯和收進甲種不少、大康成專收戊種、餘若德孚公茂順泰等均有相當進胃、故雖在益昌生大聯益及久豐等賣出中、市價仍繼續邁進、市况漸有向榮之象、綜計一日結果、各債皆回好二角半至四角半不等、成交總數、共計約九十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交冠生　股五十股、價爲四十二元、</p>

<h3>糖市　洋糖繼升</h3>
<p>昨日糖市公會劃盤、二四粗白外棧貨開六十五元三角、六十五元六角至六十六元、結果最高做至六十六元四角、比上日升一元餘、轉口貨五十元五角五十元○七角○九角至五十一元、太古Ｂ嘜七十二元六角、跌至七十二元三角、復回漲至七十三元、</p>
<p>又糖昨山香港來一千一百九十包、又由厦門來三百十包、</p>
<h3>絲茶　輯里經由日商</h3>
<p>昨國外絲市仍平穩無奇、本埠方面僅日商洋行有賬、計做開一百五十担、均爲輯里經六個號子、售價則殊不易探聽、有謂每祖二千二百五十元、亦有謂二千四百五十元、蓋出售者均秘而不宣也、印非英法均乏問津、二十八日有絲五十包經運暹邏、</p>
<h3>煤炭　煤球連跌三盤　每噸一百元</h3>
<p>煤球行情、初因同業競爭、跌價傾銷、後聞某新廠又將開工、同行嫉妬、勢不兩立、日昨一天間廠盤做小三次、連跌一十二元行情、計開義泰興南洋大廠煤球、自車每噸一百元、送到另加車力、本街門莊、每担五元五六角不等、</p>

<h3>金融述評</h3>
<p>— 聖</p>
<p>—七月二十七日止—</p>
<p>英鎊的匯率，自從一九三九年八月以來，因爲英國對德宣戰後，行市即迅速地降落。在倫教市塲上以收盤價言，自八月二十四日約四·六八降爲二十五日約四·四八，九月二日降爲四·一九，而五日更降爲四·〇二，英政府因之於九月十四日規定法價以四·〇二賣出美元，而以四、〇四買進美元，故自此以後，倫敦英鎊匯率卽轉穩定。一九四〇年一月六日升至四·〇二五，直到現在未有更變過，但是在紐約市塲上，英鎊匯率下降甚速，以收盤行市言在一九三九年份八月到十二月的五個月中，計自四·六八一二五落到三、八五，於是在國外金融市塲上乃有自由英鎊的產生。一九四〇年三月二十五日實施外匯統制條例後，自由英鎊行市的跌落更見迅速，在四月中見過三、一五元，六月八日外匯統治強化，自由英　行市稍見好轉。茲錄一九三九年至一九四〇年七月二十六日止的行市統計如下：</p>
<p>一九三九年</p>
<p>八月　四·六八　四、二九</p>
<p>九月四·二六　三、八二</p>
<p>十月　四、〇六　三、九六</p>
<p>十一月　四、〇〇　三·八五</p>
<p>十二月　三、九六　三、九〇</p>
<p>一九四〇年</p>
<p>一月　四、〇〇　三、九三</p>
<p>二月　三·九九　三·九三</p>
<p>三月　三、九四　三、五三</p>
<p>四月　三、五八　三、四六</p>
<p>五月　三、五〇　三·一五</p>
<p>六月　三、八七　三、一九</p>
<p>七月　三·九一　三、六六</p>
<p>英國戰時外匯雖然經過三次的加緊統制，然而對於自由英鎊的跌價，仍屬無法禁止。據倫敦「經濟學家」雜誌所估計，運用自由英鎊的數量，僅佔英國全部對外公私收支的百份之五至十，因之對自由英鎊的存在，發生兩種意見：贊成自由英鎊之存在的說，非正式市塲中英鎊行市的趨勢，不必加以干涉，應該任其自尋平衡的水準，假如過度的跌落，勢會促進英國的輸出，獎勵外人所負債務的償還，結果可以糾正過度的跌落。但反對自由英鎊存在的人則認爲英鎊的跌價，對於英國金融和政治上的聲譽均是不利，而對英國國際貿爲害更甚大，因爲現在自由英鎊的跌落，對於促進輸出的効力不能和平時相比，戰時輸出的數量要看國內需要之後，有吾剩餘而定多少，滙率的高低關係較輕。至於外人購進英鎊償還債務一點，若自由英鎊趨勢不穩，債務者反將觀望不決，而等待將來可按更爲有利的自由英鎊行市購英鎊，以供償債。所以有人建議欲取締自由英鎊，祇有設法减少它的來源，因之有六月八日的嚴格外匯統制辦法。（未完）</p>

<h3>美禁碎鐵汽油出口　以行動代替警告　出口領照制度意義廣博　有識者對此舉當不漠視　（伍德海精闢言論）</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報昨載伍德海論美國在事實上禁運碎鐵與汽油一文稱、華盛頓宣佈碎鐵及汽油之出口、嗣後須獲得特別執照、此事意義、殊為廣博、是項運動、曾經有勢力方面在過去數月內努力鼓吹、主要的為一種對付日本之姿態、美國之同情中國者、曾促請政府實施禁運、謂美國抗議日本濫炸中國、尤其是危及在華之美人生命與財產、又一面則又以碎鐵及汽油供給日本政府、事屬矛盾、</p>
<p>美日緊張　局勢造成</p>
<p>今悉美國實行禁運、不惟為限止此類貨物落入日本之手、亦所以避免其經由西班牙而轉以供給軸心國家、是以出口領照之制度、行將付諸實施、難非為完全對付日本、要不能不視為美日關係、益趨緊張嚴重所致之後果、不僅由於本埠連續發生之案件、激起美國廣泛之怒潮、更且日方在華北實施貿易限制、致使外商進出口貿易、蒙受等於禁運之影響、日本對美國之限止重要戰事供應品的道義禁運、提出抗議、一面則又在華北排除美國商業、其不合邏輯、不言可喻、</p>
<p>駛日油船　拒發執照</p>
<p>美國政府業已拒絕發許可證與駛日之油船、僅為拒給運油至日本及日方佔領區之另一步驟、日本近衛內閣、今謀完全改革該國之外交政策、內容究屬如何、尚未發表、惟一般認為恐將牽入軸心國集團、而向盎格魯撤克遜民族之國家表示强硬之態度、若干日本之極端派人物、公然鼓吹向美挑戰、然近衛暨其外相、是否傾向於此種主張、仍屬疑問、惟不可否認者、為在華之若干日人、公然作不利於美國之危險行動也、</p>
<p>有效警告　未能坐視</p>
<p>日本大使館發言人雖聲稱、日本並未採取反美之態度、但事實不允抹煞者、杭州日軍曾參加散發『要求美國退出東亞』之傳單、並脅稱『日本新內閣成後、即將採取其他步驟對付、』反美運動之獲有官方支持、豈容圖賴、美國總統之採取行動、申展其禁運之權力及於美國之油鐵出品、係為一種使日本有識人士不能坐視不問之警告、此事顯然證明官方對最近上海及中國其他各地礙及美人事件之憤怒、南京竟要求驅逐美僑六人出境、此事實陷於極危險之境南京在本埠所施之暴行與反美運動暗符、是益所以泛濫美國之憤怒洪潮也、</p>
<h3>德輪復航浙海交涉　尚無結果　據魯麟洋行稱　月底可見分曉</h3>
<p>封鎖將屆半月之滬浙航運、因各外國有關方面之交涉無效、各外商航輪、阻停船者已在二十艘以上、本埠德商各輪船公司、自向德外交部呈請對日交涉後、至昨日下午、據禮和洋行船務部消息、該項交涉猶無結果、故該洋行之謀福海福等輪、一時復航之望甚少、惟另據德商魯麟洋行方面稱、該項交涉、本月三十日或可望獲有結果、故該將行之高登輪是否往瀝港、日前由溫返滬之飛康輪是否再駛溫州、待本月三十日或可宣怖、至前由滬駛閩已屆旬日之英商怡隆公司神福輪、現仍杳無消息、</p>
<p>結關難允</p>
<p>江海關因接日海軍通知、對於浙閩封鎖之港口、禁止外輪結關、據海關西籍高級關員稱、日海軍在該處既實施封鎖、海關即或放行、仍有意外、故為航行浙閩沿海港口之客貨安全計、在未接日海軍解除封鎖之通知前、尚不能取銷停止結關之禁令、</p>
<p>海門航務</p>
<p>至浙江海門亦在禁航之例、況非淪陷區域、故日籍商輪不能航行、所傳華東海運局之華東輪駛往海門一節、實係誤傳、</p>
<h3>東區市政窳敗　外僑抗議　警務衛生均無辦法　外僑相約不納捐稅</h3>
<p>大　報云、寓居　山區東熙華德路六〇九弄之僑若干人、頃告記者云、當軸茍不給予充分警務保護、及衛生服務、並移除弄中露屍、則彼等決計不納市政捐稅、擬其中某外僑稱、彼等四週里中、每夜乞丐畢命、而無人收屍、渠近曾二度遇盜、而未見巡捕影蹤、且垃圾車來往無定時、每逢天雨、絕不見垃圾車到來、彼等曾向該區捕房一再抗議、皆無結果、故非至情況好轉、彼等不付分文捐稅、惟該處一簇房屋住戶多德籍難民皆係新近抵滬、未敢有所行動、故仍按期納稅云云、又某西婦亦稱、渠近曾在馬路中白晝被匪徒搶去手提皮包、而四週未見巡捕、無從呼援、里弄中乞丐露屍日多、蠅群四集、實該區居民康健之嚴重威脅、</p>

<h3>商團俄國隊歸併　尚待部署　該隊歸併後任務與　法租界白俄隊類似</h3>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、工部局經濟委員會臨時報告書建議將商團俄國隊歸併警務處、已經該局核准、然據向警務處高級官員獲悉、俄國隊併入警務處後之維持計劃如何、或經費若干、迄未可知、據工部局某官員稱、俄國隊按照建議中之新計劃、担任何種任務、穿何制服、以及值班時是否續備步槍及刺刀、</p>
<p>抑備手槍</p>
<p>暨其他種類詳情、皆未能商定、惟渠信經濟委員會建議之主要目的、在增進俄國隊之效能及公共租界之內部安全、一方面則求　動、厦門路建造監獄營房一所、估計須費約十七萬五千元、至少將在四五間月後新營房落成而俄國隊從目下租居之外灘及九江路房屋遷入新營房後、始行併入警務處、關於制服一層、未獲確息、惟信俄國隊隊員暫將穿</p>
<p>原有戎衣</p>
<p>因縫製三百人之新制服、所費頗巨、與換節政策不符也、聞俄國隊歸併警務處後、將担任與法租界警務處白俄輔助隊相類之任務、其餉銀則與刻在商圈中所獲數目相同、至於俄國隊日後工作之完全計劃、将由警務處長包文上校作短期休假返滬後擬具之、查經濟委員會報告書中表示、俄國隊隊員日後仍有調入後備隊之同樣機會、而逐步訓練、予以遷升、俄國隊之警務訓練工作、將由管轄後備隊之副警務處長羅柏臣負責、該隊現有官佐、仍留原職、</p>

<h3>香港戒備仍嚴　華僑組自衛團　全國五千人將發給槍械　港地電訊機關保護嚴密</h3>

<p>（保護電局）</p>
<p>又港當局爲恐不良分子闖入電訊機關企圖搗亂計、已將交通部大東大北等電報局加以戒備、任何外間人士不得入內、卽前往拍發電報者、亦僅能在門口接洽、不能照往昔情形、直接進入局內、</p>
<p>（加緊空防）</p>
<p>至於當局對防空設備、更積極不遺餘力、現除創設防空班、由華人及各校學生前往訓練、以應需要外、並將各團領事館及個重要軍政機關、及密集香港山上之大小建築物、均用草綠色顏料、加以僞裝、</p>
<h3>大幫匪徒　組織刦槍黨　總巢穴設在曹家渡　巡捕手槍被刦甚多</h3>

<h3>滬西開槍事　英軍發表文告　阿煦摩會檢查哨兵槍彈　當場證明並無一彈缺少</h3>
<p>學林西報云、昨（二十六日）夜十時甫過、英軍官警公共租界警務處日裔兵隊及「市警局」要員紛紛到達億定盤路大西路轉角、調查值差該地「市警」一名所稱英哨兵開放手槍四響事、英軍當局昨夜</p>
<p>（發表文告）</p>
<p>稱據當場之查所悉、值調該處兩哨位崗英兵、絕無開槍者、可見「市警」之言全無根據、此點已使日裔兵隊及「市警」局官員皆感滿意云、先是值差該地之「市警」一名、指英哨兵開槍、另有「市警」數名、從旁附和、該處英哨兵隊長</p>
<p>（立卽報告）</p>

<h3>美國的夏天</h3>
<p>— 伯明譯紐約泰晤士報</p>
<p>世界各國人對於美國的力量和資源，毫無疑義的都認爲天字第一。可是他們對於美國人的神經，總不免有些疑惑。他們心目中的美國人，無非一天到晚，除了「發財」之外，簡直沒有片刻休息，好像沒頭蒼蠅，到處亂飛。</p>
<p>其實這些印象完全是皮相之談，不是從報紙或書本上得　的，便是在旅行美國時，在幾個大城市　，走馬看花，　看到了美國人極度緊張的情緒。至於拜金求財，本來人同此心，不過美國人在甫北戰爭之後，「立刻發財」的念頭　大，那時候在許多「冒險家」白手成家，發了幾千百萬的大財，歐洲人看了他們的自傳、傳記、或掌故軼聞之類，自然祇覺得這班人無菲要錢不要命之流亞了。</p>
<p>其實，美國人的悠閒享樂，逍遙自然，近五六十年以來，經過了逐漸的進步，在社會生活上早已起了重大的轉變。單講他們的夏令生活，已經從氣候的變遷，成爲心理的改變了。</p>
<p>經濟發達和敎育發達這兩項，乃是使得美國夏令生活大轉變的因素。自夏季旅館，夏季俱樂部等嬗變以來，差不多越到夏天，活動的景象越多。歷年以來，美國社會日趨　榮，一般人都能置備一輛汽車，由本來爲少數人的奢侈品，一變而爲大衆的必需品。於是最緊要的旅行工具，已是家家所常備的了。山邊水涯，只要名勝所在，早發夕至，幾於無遠弗屆。向來視旅行爲麻煩的，從此可以隨心所欲，樂此不疲哩。</p>
<p>旅行可以增加知識，改換環境，又是吸取各種新村料的不二法門。於是許多人，就借此長時期的暑假，來補習他們的功課，增進他們的知識，允其是大中小學生和大學敎授等，利用良好的環境，多餘的晷暇，來從事於敎育和學識上的修養。</p>
<p>美國的夏天，爲時相當長。從六月底到九月初三個月暑期　，都可以出外旅行，在山邊水涯，農鄕小村裏，逍遙自然。只要有了一輛汽車，和若干的金錢，便够資格移居鄉村了。因爲社會繁榮，實業發達，個人資產和餘晷的增進，中等階級的美國人，爲適應一年中的生活起見，已開始有兩個家庭的趨勢。所奇怪的，一九二九年至一九三二年中，社會經濟情狀雖然惡劣，而這個舒滴的生活方式，却並未受到影　。反之，幾千萬的失業者，一年中多半時期移居在鄕村或　林中的木屋　，開支方面反而節省。</p>
<p>夏令生活變化多端，少至個人一已，多至成　結隊，各視環境的條件互有不同。有一家家長在大學校　任事的，克動克儉的家庭，在夏季數月中，學校放假，丈夫無事可爲，便弄了一隻平底船，裝載了些日用必須得物品，揚上片帆，在內湖　悠悠緩駛，一直到一個人跡罕至的孤島上消夏。直　金風送爽，霜降葉落，方才　返　間。還有一位在出版公司日事的女士，她夏季實際上　休假時期很短暫，祇不過兩星期光景。她在每一個屋期六下午，和一有空閒的日子，把汽車停靠在門前，一溜烟的去了，不至東西南北，隨意所至，直到暮　蒼茫，然後在客寓中落宿。社會上交際慣的太太小姐們，本來一到晚上十時至十二時間，出入在紙醉金迷，燈紅酒綠之塲的在夏季倒也空了起來，她們不時發現於村舍的廚房　，或山間的花園中，做些蒔花拔草的工作。</p>
<p>美國人的夏令生活中有兩個特殊之點，與汽車、財產、和餘晷三者相互並進，而成爲世界任何各地夏令生活的特殊情狀。第一就是孩童夏令營，歷史悠久，現已成爲國民實業之一。如果把童子軍露宿人數也計算在內，每年參加這種夏令營生活的美國孩童，至少在二百萬人左右。據一九三三年調查，全國這種組織不下三千四百八十五起，他們的地點不是在水濱便是在森林之中，時期　六個至八個星期不等。本來這種優美的環境，和良好的設備，像水濱山邊的蘆舍木屋，垂釣游艇的優閒生活，祗有仗着父兄們有錢的富家子，才有福氣去享受，而現在中人之家，只要稍爲納些費用，他們的兒女也就能享到這種淸福了。一方面夫婦們把兒女送到夏令營去後，自有專家去管理他們，用不著本人去操心，而夫婦倆更可在農村或遠道之鄉，毫無牽累的過幾星期快樂日子。</p>
<p>孩童夏令營的飛突猛漲，當然與社會的經濟滋長大有關係，至於說是單純的由於好清　享樂，那卻不對的。近年以來，中人之家爲了在都市謀生起見，從鄕郊喬遷到城市去的，實繁有徒，一到夏天，孩子們還在悶處在二三十　的高樓中，或奔跑在街角巷尾，在身心雙方都受不到益處，於是夏令營的事業就如雨後春筍了。</p>
<p>第二個特徵爲夏令學校，這夏令學校的範圍却是十分廣泛，從正式的大學校一學程起，至設在山頂或松塢間的寫作或舞蹈學校爲止。各種性質的敎育都有，眞是不勝枚舉。現在入大學念書的靑年子女，年多一年，於是這良好的夏季，當然不能把它白白放過，正得利用機會，叫兒女們多受些敎育，一方面因爲社曾經濟情狀好轉，十六歲左右的學齡靑年，現在到了夏季也不必再叫他們做些短工，以補助學費等之不足了。因之夏令學校的需要，較之往年更爲發達。至於成人方面，許多一年到頭沒有閒暇的人，正好趁此時機，利用優美的環境，來補習他們所心愛或需要的功課哩。所以在實體上，所謂夏令學校者，正不過是集合休息，敎育、工作，和社會於一爐的一個集體呢。</p>
<p>美國人的夏令生活，在心理上實佔非常重要的位置。真如歐洲人所目擊的，任何美國城市中都充滿了緊張急迫的情緒，各種聲息，交織不斷的電話電報，中年婦人的社交忙錄，靑年母親爲她們子女費盡心機的找尋一切益利，闖戶入室貨物推銷員的緊張情狀，喊賣報紙的尖銳呼叫聲，電影中的刺激　—這樣的生活怎不叫人頭破腦漲，神經極度的緊張呢？然而美國人自有他的打算，忙碌的時候果然透不過氣來，而消夏逭暑，幽閒生活的個尋却也高人一等，一年十找二月，實際上做緊張工作的祗有九個月，其餘的三個月就是這悠閒的夏令生活時期了。大半的中等人士，尤其是都市民衆，經過了九個月的長期奮鬥，便有二十多個星期的休息，美國人的神經得以保全常態者，當然大爲得力於道個夏季生活了。</p>
<p>十九世紀的時候，歐洲作家和美國人自己意見相同的點，就是覺得美國人的神經極度緊　而成爲衰弱之狀。只要看那姆珊叔叔的樣子，長長的臉，尖尖的下巴—這就是神經衰弱的表徵。而近日的美國人却已一變那乾枯緊張的長臉，而爲紅潤圓渾的臉蛋子了。女太太們的瘦削芳容，也已大見寬廣豐潤。雖然市上出賣藥品的廣吿，還有不少爲治療疝痛，便秘等者，但是這些疾病已不足爲美國人患了。</p>
<p>歐洲人的旅行美國的，很少在夏季作長時期的勾留，於是他們只看見了美國人緊張的情緒，而後有領略到優　的夏令生活。夏令的悠閒，眞有些詩意存在其間，卽拿駕駛汽車而言，在夏季的田野　，走過一個山坡，慢慢地上落，白雲當頭，野趣橫生，當他停下來的時候，便可儘情領略田野和林木間的風鱟了。卽在女太太們，在這節令間，也因爲盛裝太熱，很自然的披些輕服，旣不打牌，也不聽講，祗做些適體順性的日常生活而已。</p>
<p>最繁盛的紐約，本來無所謂休假的，可是一到夏天，情景也大爲變更，好像一個入戀的婦人，衣　，容貌，舉止，沒有一個地方不見變更。日方亭午，街道中已見閒散的樣子，汽車走在半空的派克大道上，只有心平氣和約聲息，也不怒吼了。孩子們在人行道上，獨往獨來，大模大樣，好像當作自產一般，看門人只穿着　衫，坐在沿街石上休息，百貨商店的司閣連服裝都懶得去整理，女太太們大多凭憑在窗口，有氣無力的　　而已。</p>
<p>一到夏天，美國人變做　無牽無掛，而最悠遊自然的認了。沒有疲乏，不見衰老，恢復元氣，保持靑春，把冬天的緊張情緒，一驅而散，準備着迎接初秋的新園地。只要見一瓣紅楓，聽到一聲　鳴，美國人的在長夏中所恢復，所存儲的精力，又要開始向生生不息之路上，邁步前進了。</p>
<h3>德軍戰車及其戰術</h3>
<p>德國新戰術的第二種兵器，卽戰車密集攻擊，猶如其空軍發展樣，也是數年來的產物。法國鐵甲部隊前總監凡爾普里將軍曾云，一戰車及其運用毫無進步者已十五年！皆因德國無此兵器之故。」</p>
<p>此語對德國軍事當局雖未免過譽，但所表明者僅一部份眞相。蓋德國陸軍不得使用戰車者，閱十五年，其間僅建迭少數樣車，但唯其如此，亦得不爲傳統的戰術所束縛，一俟時機成熟，卽可隨心所欲。至一九三三年，乃能根據全部革新計劃，發展戰車的種種威力</p>
<p>他國軍隊，尤其是法國陸軍，仍視戰車爲步兵的輔助兵器，故使之續受步兵步伐的束縛，而將戰車隊平均分派予陸軍。德國新軍則不然，自始卽決定解除戰車所受的束縛，將其從輔助兵器脫穎而出，使之成爲獨立兵器，編成强有力的師團，純以密集及迅速而有特殊威力，突破敵軍陣綫，使全部戰局成爲運動戰。</p>
<p>德國在重整軍術的最初數間，即隨蘇聯與義大利的先例，聚精會神於輕戰車的大量製造，車重六噸，裝機關槍二挺，甲厚不出十分之六吋，速率每小時三十五哩。</p>
<p>這種戰車，　西班牙內戰，遭遇政府軍薄弱的戰車防禦砲及稍重的蘇聯戰車，所獲戰果甚爲低劣。德方得此教訓，因乃完全改變策略。其結果，卽在一九三八年四月二十日希特勒誕辰閱兵時見之，蓋其時已造成新式輕戰車，重八噸或十噸。除機關槍外，尚裝八　炮一尊。另一種中型戰車，重十八頓至二十五噸，裝一、五　或一　炮，每輛乘士兵五人</p>
<p>德國克　伯工廠同時並試驗一種重一百噸的巨型戰車，裝四吋炮一尊及三吋炮二尊，機關槍十二挺至十五挺，乘士兵十九人，甲厚約四　。一九一八年間德方所造成的巨型戰車兩輛，可資比較。此種戰車，重一百五十噸，裝三吋砲四尊，機關槍兩挺，乘士兵二十二人，甲厚兩　弱，德方從未使用。</p>
<p>目下德國戰事隊以上述三種爲主體。一九三五年　，編成三師。至一九三八年杪，擴充至重機械化部隊五師，每師戰車兩團，各備戰車二百輛，　以摩托在步兵，炮兵，工兵，信號兵，及輜重兵。迄至波蘭戰爭時，其數至少已增至六師。目下已增至十二師，共約戰車五千輛，其中重戰車五百輛，中型戰車二千輛，　戰車二千五百輛。此外，尚有所謂「飛快師」者，其數不詳，每師有輕戰車一百輛，輔以鐵甲車，機器脚踏車，摩托化砲車，摩托化步兵。此種「飛快師」係以代替昔日之騎兵。</p>
<p>德國戰車部隊在波蘭及法國獲得　人勝利者，一部份固因於巨型重戰的威力，惟其主要原因，則在德軍對於極度極敏的戰術，具有特殊訓練，由陸軍發揮爲密集攻擊及大規模的戰術。此種戰術，唯在平時受有系統的訓練之大隊常備軍，始能運用自如，絕非獨立的戰車隊和輔助隊島合而成所能勝任？</p>
<p>戰車不僅須擊毀機關槍，如上次大戰時然，且須擊毀戰軍防禦砲和其他戰車防禦兵器，如地雷和障碍物等。故戰車進攻時陣容頗爲複雜，須分成連續數批，各有特殊任務和目標。第一批係最重型戰車，用以突破敵方重要隙碍和陣地。第二批爲中型戰車，乃攻擊的主力，其特殊任務在擊毀敵方戰車防禦砲，並須利用地勢疾駛而進，如果可能，並須從兩側或前後作鉗式夾擊。第三批多屬輕戰車，雜以少數中型戰車，其主要任務，在擊毀敵方機關槍，使步兵及特殊摩托化炮隊及　軍隊隨之前進。</p>
<p>此種戰術，雖注重迅速與出其不意兩點，但其目的非僅在銜過敵陣，其最注重者，厥在以優勢的火力，擊破敵方的抗力。德方戰車與敵方戰車交鋒時，其戰術注重於最要之點，即首先瞄準射擊敵方戰車。據上次大戰經　，這點已證明可決定勝負。德方戰車向敵方戰車用火力攻擊得手後，始向前進攻。質言之，即以火力的控制，行動的調整，運用全力猛撲敵方弱點，奪取局部的優勢，以圖擊潰敵軍。</p>
<p>戰車即以集中進攻爲主，其他各種部隊均居於輔助地位，須擇地擇時加以運用。惟飛機的合作最爲重要。飛機能從空中輔助戰車隊長偵察地形，並向敵軍轟炸掃射，以助第一批戰車作戰，更能對付敵方空軍反攻，協助戰車追擊。</p>
<p>此種運動戰，對於德國陸軍的　個戰術與戰略，影響甚大。一方面德國步兵與法蘇等國不同，他國都受有嚴格的訓練，作戰時無需藉戰車的協助，儘能使用自備的重兵器，戰車因得集中攻擊。另一方面，此種密集攻擊，即以重戰車隊附以摩托化步兵作主力的進攻，僅以步兵主力的進攻，自必截然不同。德軍此次在西綫進攻，勢如破竹，卽其明證。</p>

<h3>戰勝黑暗</h3>
<p>孩子，快些睡吧！時候不早了。『媽，我怕·』在每一個晚上，不知有多少小朋友在說着：『媽？我怕。』怕什麼；怕黑暗。所以白晝天真無邪的孩子，到了晚上睡了的時候，取物的時候，非得有人陪伴，是不肯獨自前往的，小朋友們，你們為什麼對於黑暗存了神秘莫測的態度，是什麼怕黑暗比教師的嚴詞，父母的實打還厲害，到底是什麼　故呢？我現在把它分成兩　　：第一，在童年的時候，　　有趣，常常不肯睡覺，即使被逼着上床，翻來覆去不肯閉眼，於是母親或傭婦嚇你說：再不睡，老虎要來了。或其他你平日怕的事物。即時你認以為真的，不得已的睡着，這樣一次二次後，在兒童的小心靈中刻着一個可怕的陰影因這些恐嚇的話，都是在睡覺時說的，所以每睡在床上睡不着，就想老虎啊！可怕的人啊！愈想愈怕，望着四周，一片漆黑，不覺毛骨悚然，日漸養成了膽怯的心理。第二，在晚上，家人們都空閑了，於是說東道西，尤喜談妖魔鬼怪，兒童聽後，疑神疑鬼因黑暗中不能看明物體的輪廓，偶而聽見聲音或看錯物件，偶認為鬼怪。家長亦以為怕黑暗是兒童的天性，不待孩童要求，早日陪伴在旁，處處暗示着黑暗的可怕，自己反而沒有知覺。這種怕黑的感覺，根深蒂固於幼童的腦中，直到十四五歲還沒有除掉，到了二十歲左右，一人還不敢獨往空曠的地方，這恐懼心理的造成，削弱了兒童的勇氣，埋沒了超然獨立的精神。</p>
<p>小朋友們！我們如何去戰勝黑暗，如何趕出我們腦中的陰影，　　的方法，就是請祖母母親不再講鬼怪的故事以免貽　弟妹，積極的方法，親自觀察我引為疑惑的事物，例如在黑暗中，好像看見一樣白的東西，那時你不必逃避，開了電燈到那地方去看，就知道掛着的是一件白衣服或一塊布，你的疑團立刻消失，日子久後，你不必開燈，一聽見聲音，就猜想那是老鼠在咬東西，不再疑神疑鬼的存着害怕的心理了。</p>
<p>後一個辦法，在起初是很難的，所以不妨請他人陪你一同觀察。以後自己的經騐增加，知道鬼怪是沒有的，疑團消失心膽立壯，萬事都不怕了。怕黑暗的小朋友，照這辦法去試一試吧！</p>
<h3>兩把茶壺</h3>
<p>— 金箴</p>
<p>天真熱！到得一吃好了早飯，阿慧的母親便帶着他和哥哥！阿明，到親戚家去探望，因為早上是比較涼快一些，要是在下半天出去，那太陽真像吃人老虎一般的可怕，在那親戚家裏作一短時間的逗留，便打算踏上回家之途。</p>
<p>他母親在路上乘便買了一把泡茶的茶壺，却引起了阿慧兄弟倆的一番爭論。</p>
<p>事情是這樣：他們踏進了專賣陶器的店舖，一眼看見那一角櫥窗裏放着各式各樣的茶壺，而其中的兩把是同樣的廣度，不過一把高，一把低，但它們的茶壺嘴却是一樣高的，然而倒底那一把茶壺能多盛一點水呢？這一個問題成了他們倆爭論的導火綫。</p>
<p>『無疑的，那高的一把茶壺當然可多盛些水，你不信，去叫店裏的老闆來，問他那一隻價錢貴？那高的一定是來得貴，因為它能多盛水呀。』阿慧滔滔不休的說得似乎很有理由，同時那老闆的答覆，更使阿慧的主張充實得多，真所謂火上加油，那理由便可成立，也確定阿慧的勝利。</p>
<p>『不用强辯，拿事實來證明，倒底我對，還是你對』？阿明也死不屈服而他早已胸有成竹了。他便把那兩把茶壺平放在桌子上，更叫老闆去拿了一面盆的水來，又拿了隻茶杯盛了水注到兩把茶壺裏，先把水注入那低的一把，水漸漸地滿了，更注入到那高的一把，在水快要齊茶壺口的當兒，阿慧僅僅看見水從茶壺嘴裏溢出來，於是把兩把茶壺裏的水倒出來，那結果確使阿慧目瞪口呆了。</p>
<p>『事實上是這麼樣，你下回不可再這樣不加思考而自以為很確切的大發議論。你現在可知道為什麼不能和你的理想相符合？當把水注入高的一把茶壺，只能把水注到茶壺嘴口的限度，如果再注入，水就要從壺口裏溢出，因為兩把茶壺嘴是一樣高的，於是低的茶壺確和壺嘴同高而壹身任何大的茶壺，能容納同樣的水量。不論在茶壺裏和壺嘴裏，水終是在同一水平綫，如果壺嘴祗有這樣高，那無論壺身是這麼樣高大，那你無論這樣不能把水注滿壺身，一滿水就從壺嘴裏溢出，所以一把茶壺的水的容量，祗要看它的壺嘴有多少高，這完全是水平的關係。』</p>

<h3>秀蘭鄧波兒自傳（十二）</h3>
<p>可甘，我來告知你當初替教育影片公司短片中工作的的情形。第一部影片就是一九三二年夏間拍攝的那部『如此光榮』，那時我只三歲哩。媽媽帶同我到攝影場去，伊不像在我第一次試鏡頭時那麼激動，但是心中却很快樂。伊表面上雖很鎮靜，並沒有什麼表示，而我早知伊是一向盼望我踏進電影界的；如今既實現了伊的願望，那得不樂。並且我料到伊在做小女孩子的時節，伊自己也很願意踏進電影界呢。</p>
<p>在這第一部影片中，我的說白很少，不過十二行光景，而且一半是法蘭西話。我所表演的，不過是一場歌舞，照着音樂的拍子，搖動兩個肩胛，一面還要轉動兩眼，好像做媚眼的樣子。我的身子也像女明星桃樂絲特李墺先前在。如此光榮中表演時，穿一件短短的網衣，而把一個肩胛袒露出來。</p>
<p>但你知道在影片中表演些什麼？我竟和兩個男孩子接吻了，這是我也世以來從來不曾有過的事；而且不止一個，竟和兩個男孩子接吻啊！如此，你可不能說我沒有愛人了。百分那兩個男孩子，一個名員琪恩白德勒有一個名喚喬奇史密司，他們都在四歲左右，雖還束着尿布，却都是長得很漂亮的。他們倆都願意和我結婚，我和他們接吻之後，立刻應允了。但我不知道他們倆現在怎麼樣，因為我們自從在那部影片中分手後，從沒有遇見過。</p>
<p>我自從這一部影片以後，對於戀愛方面的把戲，也正表演得多哩。我一見像密鄧恩，銜就愛上了他。我在『起立歡呼』那部偉大影片中做主角，他也在內，他一見我，也就愛上我了。據他說，他之愛我，超過世界任何一個女子；我相信他的話，你可也相信麼？有一天他當着媽媽面前，抱我起來和我接吻！</p>
<p>其次是里昂巴里摩亞先生，我也愛他的。他在我的『小將軍』片中扮一個老軍人，其實他本人並不像那麼老，因此頭上戴了一個雪白的髮套。我雖是心中喜歡他，却不敢說出口來，恐怕他老人家要對我皺眉的。我曾問過媽媽，這該怎麼辦？媽媽說這個沒有關係；他要是聽說我歡喜他，也許很高興呢。於是我就等候一個機會，要對他說明一下。</p>

<p>鞠部掌故</p>
<h3>譚鑫培軼聞兩則　中和園怒打慶親王　宮廷內戲逗郎德山</h3>
<p>遲淸光緒末年，英秀堂主人譚鑫培設同慶班於前門外糧良店之中和分離器，營業鼎盛，爲各園冠。某日，慶親王偕眷屬詣中和觀劇，顧是日該園售座特旺，王至，樓座已預定一空，雖欲覓一小廂而不可得，王殊悻悻，乃强佔他客之廂而坐之。執事者與之理論，不納，且命隨從弁卒痛加毆打。時譚正在后臺化裝，聞訊大怒，亦不肯示弱，乃率眾還擊，並將與夫毆傷，王知眾寡不敵，卽踉蹌奔回府邸，時王餘恨未消，立下諭將中和私自查封，以洩己憤。翌日，適慈禧太后傳譚等入宮演劇，譚抗旨不去，太后爲之愕然，亟命御史往譚宅詢之，譚以昨宵之事對，御史據實囘奏太后，后曰：親王何得如此無理？乃命侍臣傳親王至而加以訓責；一面派員向譚慰問；並派九門提督韓大老爺，於卽夕二時，粘燈排道，親往中和啟封；至是譚始整裝進宮，面向太后謝恩，太后見譚，竟以溫語慰藉，並斥親王之非是。自是以後，譚貝勒之威名，遂益振九城而不可一世矣。此事陳石頭生前親爲余言之。</p>
<p>時凈角郎德山，方如初出　之刃，光芒萬丈，聲名藉甚。某日在內廷爲譚鑫培配演「捉放曹，」功力悉敵，口碑極佳。譚機警過人，知郎爲回教徒，乃時忽改爲「殺猪沽酒」旬時，臨時忽改爲「殺牛沽酒，」慈禧太后殊驚愕；俟戲畢，傳譚詢問，譚對曰：「郎回人，不肉食，故以牛易之。」太后聞言，大爲獎許。是日大軸爲譚之「盜魂鈴」，上塲之前，譚語眾曰：「此戲內請諸位都陪我唱，稍待好向太后領賞。」諸名角皆欣然允諾，充飾小猪八戒，郎亦未能例外。當八戒命小猪各叫一聲時，餘均作猪鳴，惟郎作羊唁唁聲，譚打揮曰：「我的小猪，能作羊鳴，」太后大樂，重加賞？？，此亦英秀供奉內廷時軼聞之一也。</p>
<h3>孟麗君之陣容</h3>
<p>國華公司某君談：「孟麗君」雖有春明出品在先，但我人耗於該片之精力物力，超過從來國華出品，他日公映，當能有優越收獲，譬如演員陣容，有周　·舒適·徐風·冀稼農·尤光照·袁紹梅·周起等，亦爲國華出品未之前見者，故此片問世，當能一新耳目云。（上圖爲該片中之一幕）</p>
<h3>費箔·英茵　反對入華聯廠拍戲</h3>
<p>英茵來滬已半年，近頃似已寂寂無聞，據云合眾對英茵最大期望爲主演「西太后」，但劇本尚未完全脫稿，合眾在未發現較「西太後」更動人的劇本前，不願令英茵漏臉。按該片導演，早已請定費穆担任，但費穆表示不願加入華聯石工作，因此「西太後」一旦開攝，如不另覓新址，則導演勢非易人不可，咸認此對英茵前途，是一損失也。</p>
<h3>李綺年動態</h3>
<p>李綺年來滬已有多日，因爲扁桃腺割治後，需要休養，故暫寓金門飯店，尚未去攝影塲工作。據她說，到了上海，衹到大光明看過「古屋疑雲」，預備下星期去看「亂世佳人」。此片雖在星加坡連映一月，但等她從香港到那裏去演義務戲的時候，剛剛映完，所以一直沒有看。她還定下星期二晚去璇宮看舞台劇「李香君」聽說這晚藝華公司已定座一排，準備欣賞唐若靑的戲。綺年和若靑還是一對好朋友呢。</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞後的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小靑著</p>
<p>第四章　幾種推想</p>
<p>倪金壽忽想起了什麼似地接嘴說：「可是發案以後，這窗和窗帘都是開着的。」</p>
<p>「是的，那也許是伊在來客離去後開的，或是客雖沒去，伊知老毛已睡，安全無礙，才把窗推開。因爲那時伊已在這室中悶了一回；我料想他們的談話性質，一定也很費腦筋，所以伊開窗透透氣，原是很自然的舉動。我又知道這個客人在這室中曾勾留想當的時間，因此他出去時的足印，眞是微乎其微了。」</p>
<p>我也插口說：「是的，這個人的脚印，就是我們定做「乙」的。還有清楚的兩行，我們定它爲「甲」。就印的層次上看，乙印進入的時間確在甲印之前。這乙印在進入時雖曾和甲印交疊，我還找得幾個完整的，出去時的乙印，却衹找着一個完整的，而且十二分淺淡。」</p>
<p>倪金壽　頭道：「是的，不過那甲印的進和出都很淸楚。你可是說在那乙印的人出去以後，又有第二個甲印的人進來過嗎？」</p>
<p>霍桑忽縐着眉峯應道：「是的，不過這裏面就有先決的難題發生了。這甲印客可也是死者所預約的嗎？還是他的到來出於伊的意外的？還有一點，乙印的人旣然在這　室中耽擱了好久，王耀蘭又像很奉承他，那末，這個人走時伊爲什麼不送出去？進一步說，伊卽使不送客，又不便驚動老毛，也應當自己出去鎖門。但伊的皮鞋印明明告訴我們，伊昨夜進了這屋子以後，不曾再走出去，爲什麼呢？可是伊讓那乙印客離去以後，果眞還等待第二個甲印客人，故而還不必急急出去鎖門嗎？還是乙印客出去的當兒，甲印客恰巧進來故而伊已用不着出去？」</p>
<p>我插口說：「也許那乙印客就是兇手，他出去時伊已經不能送客了。」</p>
<p>霍桑並不答話，但瞧着地毯，緊蹙着眉峯，顯得在煩腦地深思。倪金壽也顯着同樣的神氣。　囘，他也建議說：「也許這個甲印客才是兇手，他一走進來就開槍將王麗蘭打死，然後拿了伊的首飾逃出去。霍先生，你看這推想可能不可能？」（五八）</p>

<p>Huiyang: Nine Japanese warships, large and small, sailed from the Shantou sea area towards Haifeng at 4:00 AM today. At dawn, under the cover of artillery fire, several motorboats carrying Japanese soldiers launched an attack on Shantou. Simultaneously, another unit of Japanese soldiers attempted to land at Xima Zong (i.e., Ma Fu) west of Shantou. The Chinese army waited until the Japanese approached, then met them head-on with concentrated firepower, killing many Japanese soldiers. The Chinese forces then lured the Japanese into favorable terrain for an ambush. After fierce fighting until 3:00 PM, both groups of Japanese soldiers were unable to withstand the attack, leaving behind hundreds of corpses and retreating to their ships to escape.

<h3>Ambassador to France Gu Weijun Willing to Discuss Peace China Now Adopts an Offensive Posture Against Japan Will Never End the War Unless Japan Abandons Aggression Hopes the United States Will Ban Raw Materials and Military Supplies to Japan</h3>
<p>Vichy: Chinese Ambassador to France Gu Weijun told a United Press reporter yesterday that as a result of the closure of the Burma Road and the Vietnamese Railway, China is now using 20,000 camels to transport food and military supplies from the Soviet Union through Turkestan to China. Dr. Gu had previously been on a mission to Lisbon for the government and arrived here yesterday. Dr. Gu stated that China has no intention of surrendering to Japan and is now adopting an offensive posture against Japan. China will never end the war for independence until Japan abandons its policy of aggression. The British government's closure of the Burma Road is indeed a severe blow to China, but China will not surrender because of it. Fortunately, with the foresight of Chairman Chiang, China now has sufficient war materials to maintain a strong international situation that is more favorable to China. The development of military industries in the interior of China is extremely rapid. The ammunition and some of the light weapons used by the army are now made in China. The morale of the Chinese army has recently been greatly boosted. The recent courageous defense of Hangzhou Bay is sufficient proof. The British government has already made concessions to Japan, but British politicians are still making deceptive statements in repeated declarations, saying that Britain is standing on the principles of law and order and that Britain is fighting not only for its own security but also for the freedom of other countries. It should be known that the closure of the Burma Road has caused great disappointment to all those who sympathize with Britain's actions in Europe, because there is no crime of aggression in the world more obvious than Japan's aggression against China. The standards of justice and righteousness in Europe are by no means different from the standards of justice and righteousness in Asia; there are absolutely no two standards. We must not regard the Suez Canal as the boundary dividing the moral standards of two kinds of international life, Europe and Asia. Britain's capitulation to Japan on the issue of transporting military supplies to China via Burma may temporarily alleviate Britain's difficulties in the Far East, but this situation cannot last long. Japanese soldiers will certainly not abandon their southward policy simply because Britain has surrendered. If Britain cannot win in Europe, what is the point of making concessions to Japan on important issues? Japan is now planning to take advantage of Britain's failure to seize the land of the broken Far Eastern empire. If Britain wins the European war, even if it is attacked by Japan (the Japanese must have hesitated for a long time before taking this action), it will not be difficult for Britain to rebuild its position in the Far East. China will still completely rely on the United States, because the United States' position has never wavered and it is rich in moral and material resources. China understands and respects the desire of the American people not to participate in the European and Asian wars, so China does not hope that the United States will send troops to maintain its integrity. It is hoped that the United States will ban the transportation of military supplies and key raw materials to Japan, because if Japan does not have the supply of these military supplies and raw materials, it will inevitably abandon its attempt to conquer China. The least the United States can do is to ban the export of oil and iron to Japan. This action by the United States will only sacrifice very meager interests, but it can greatly restrict Japan and greatly benefit China's struggle for independence.

<p>Chongqing: The New Sichuan Daily editorial states that recently, there have been frequent discussions in Chongqing political circles about the need to completely change China's foreign policy, which has led to various rumors. In fact, since the international situation has completely changed, there is indeed a need for China to change its foreign policy. Not only should the concept of foreign policy be changed, but the senior officials in charge of diplomacy should also be changed. China's previous foreign policy is outdated, so diplomacy is not very active. In order to cope with the current crisis, new people with new ideas should be employed.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Implementation of the United States' Firm Policy</h3>
<p>U.S. President Roosevelt announced the day before yesterday that four types of military oil and iron must be exported only after a special permit is issued by the State Department; at the same time, the Maritime Commission is not allowed to allow U.S. oil tankers to join the Japanese route. American commentators have said that the three Axis powers of Japan, Germany, and Italy will be most affected, or that the United States has now begun to wield its economic weapons, or that the United States has now extended its economic fist to Japan. The Japanese side also admitted that it would be greatly affected and regarded this as a very important matter for Japan. What day was the day before yesterday? July 25th, exactly the first anniversary of the United States' announcement of the termination of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty, and exactly half a year from the actual expiration of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty. Following this time, we can see how rhythmic the steps of the United States' Far East policy are!</p>
<p>The strength of the United States' Far East policy lies in its firm grip, and its weakness lies in its slow application. Those around the world who benefit from the U.S. Far East policy may be worried and disappointed due to its slowness, while those who are restrained by it may despise its slowness and hope to get lucky; these are all failures to observe the firmness of its policy, all mistakes. Originally, the Far East dispute was one part of the Pacific problem. The total national strength of the United States in the Pacific is indeed superior to any other country; with the current national strength of the United States, the expansion of a huge navy is something that no other country can catch up with; given more time, after the United States has achieved tangible results from the Pan-American Conference, its power will certainly be unmatched, and its policy will inevitably be the decisive factor in everything. This is nothing else. A policy based on fairness and freedom is inherently destined to succeed in the end, and the strength of the United States is sufficient to implement its policy.</p>
<p>The policy of the United States is like that, and Japan's aggression is like this. The depth and sharpness of the opposition between them is self-evident. What is not yet clear is that it cannot be regarded as a short-term confrontation. Tracing back to the abandonment of the commercial treaty last year, to the current prohibition of the export of four types of military oil and iron, this method is the gradual advancement of the United States in implementing its policy, and this nature is the gradual entry of the United States in implementing its policy into a stage where it is bound to be effective. Therefore, even in the near future, what kind of noteworthy response will be triggered is very possible. However, the long night will eventually dawn, so it is not permissible to expect it too quickly. Japan obtains 90 percent of the scrap iron needed for combat from the United States, and the gasoline purchased from the United States is worth about US$10 million per year. Various precision oils used for aviation motors must be obtained from the United States: now that the United States has banned exports, causing Japan to suffer extremely great impact, this is something that the Japanese side also acknowledges and does not deny. From then on, Japan will inevitably have a day when its armaments cannot be replenished, and the Japanese air force will inevitably have a day when it cannot take off; that is to say, Japan will eventually be restrained by the economic sanctions under the United States' Far East policy and will no longer be able to maintain its aggression. However, as of now, how much iron does Japan have in stock, and how much oil does it have in stock? From today until the day when the iron and oil are exhausted, how much iron and oil can be supplemented at home and abroad? Although it is said that the quantity is bound to be limited, it cannot be estimated too low. Therefore, it is a natural observation that Japan can still maintain its military aggression for a considerable period of time after the United States bans the export of oil and iron. What cannot be known is whether Japan will wait until its resources are exhausted, until the last drop of blood and the last inch of iron, before abandoning its aggression? Or will it still struggle in various ways, regardless of what new situation it will create? Or will it wake up in time and change its course? These three possibilities are for Japan to choose for itself; if it does not choose for itself, then between the United States' firm policy and China's determination to resist, there will naturally be a last resort that Japan will have to take. Shinzo Abe's recent re-election as prime minister shows a certain self-restraint, and the fragments of his political views that have been published leave room for maneuver. However, in our observation, it is easy for the cabinet to leave room for maneuver in its policies, but it is only for the cabinet to consider itself; it is difficult for the country to plan for its ability to release and recover, and this is really related to the country's destiny. Since Japan's invasion of China, its concerns about the United States have deepened day by day; at first, it regarded the interests of the United States as nothing and ignored the protests made by the United States at the end of 1938; after the United States announced the abandonment of the commercial treaty, it still believed that it could make the United States change its attitude and hoped to renew the commercial treaty; when U.S. Ambassador Grew gave sincere advice in a speech, the commercial treaty was put into effect shortly afterward, and he realized the firmness of the U.S. policy; however, a few days ago, he still hoped that the United States would not take new actions, thinking that he could do whatever he wanted before the U.S. presidential election; we have already discussed this before, knowing that it is not so, and now it has actually implemented the ban on oil and iron. The United States is slow, but Japan does not know how to make good use of the opportunity given by the delay; this is not the foolishness of the Japanese, but the power and courage of those in power cannot control the country's major plans, so they clearly know that they must change course and abandon aggression, but they still hesitate and do not know what to do; sitting and waiting in this way, they will inevitably be restrained by the firm policy of the United States one day and will not be able to maintain their dignity. This is also very regrettable.</p>
<h3>Reuters Correspondent in Tokyo, Cox, Arrested in Japan Rumor Has It Arrest Was for "Military Reasons" British Embassy Is Negotiating</h3>
<p>Local news: Last night, people in the local press were eagerly awaiting news from Tokyo to explain the arrest of Cox, Reuters correspondent in Tokyo. According to private news from Shanghai, Cox was arrested yesterday by the Japanese military police for allegedly violating one of Japan's many military regulations. Local rumors say Cox is being held at the Tokyo Military Police Headquarters for "military reasons." The British Embassy is currently conducting an investigation. Cox's arrest is quite puzzling, and no details have been released from Tokyo. The government has also not issued any announcements. It is said that the Japanese authorities have banned newspapers from publishing anything about this matter. As far as we know here, no news agency in Tokyo has been able to obtain any detailed information. No direct news has come from Tokyo so far. It is expected that the Japanese authorities in Tokyo will issue an official announcement tonight. People in the local press all know that Cox is a senior correspondent, so they regard the news of his misunderstanding with the Japanese military police as a very big concern. Because of Cox's personality, he is quiet and cautious in his actions. His writings have always adopted a prudent and conservative policy, especially when it comes to political events that the Japanese are currently sensitive to. Although Cox has always been known for being frank and daring to speak out, he is by no means an imprudent news correspondent who sometimes uses sensational words carelessly. Cox has been in his current position in Japan for six years and knows the Japanese very well. As soon as many reporters in Shanghai received news of Cox's detention, the illusion of another Young case could not help but appear in their minds. Although the crime Cox is accused of is still unknown, people here all believe that it is related to his journalistic work, or that Cox had written something that the Japanese authorities considered defamatory or unfriendly. Some people also believe that Cox's arrest has nothing to do with his journalistic activities. Cox has a wide range of social connections in Shanghai and has joined the Shanghai Club and the Race Club as a member. He is one of the senior foreign correspondents in Tokyo. Since 1934, he has served as the chief Reuters correspondent in Japan. After joining Reuters in London in 1901, he was transferred to Mumbai for five years. In 1909, he was promoted to manager of Reuters in Columbus. In 1912, he was transferred to manager of Reuters in Shanghai. He resigned in 1918. From 1922 to 1925, he served as manager of Reuters in Hong Kong. In 1930, he came to Shanghai again and served as manager of Reuters' Far East News Department. He was transferred to his current position in 1934. Cox is currently 55 years old and was born in Rightwell, Kent, England. (Reuters)</p>
<p>Local news: It is reported that when British Ambassador to Japan Craig met with Japan's new Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke this afternoon, he discussed the detention of Reuters correspondent in Tokyo Cox, but the announcement issued by the Japanese Foreign Ministry regarding this meeting did not mention this matter at all. According to private news, Cox was arrested at 8:00 AM yesterday at his summer resort on the coast 30 miles outside of Tokyo. (Reuters)</p>

<h3>Sichuan and Hunan Provinces Expect Good Harvests</h3>
<p>Chongqing: It is appropriately declared here from relevant sources that the rice and wheat harvest in the non-occupied areas this year is expected to be "very satisfactory," so there is no fear of food shortage. The Sichuan Province has recently had several days of sweet rain. Before the rain, agricultural experts estimated that the autumn harvest this year would be no more than 30 percent at most. Now that it has rained heavily for several days in a row, this year's harvest should be around 70 percent, which is roughly the same as last year. As for the so-called 100 percent harvest, it is purely a theory, and in fact it has never been achieved. In addition to Sichuan, there is no worry about poor harvests in other provinces. For example, Yunnan and Guizhou, which often have poor harvests, are also expected to have good harvests this year. The harvests in Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Guangxi are expected to be good. Even the northwest provinces are said to be doing well. Therefore, people are generally celebrating, thinking that this phenomenon is tantamount to a major victory in the military.

<h3>North China Foreign Commerce Set to Stagnate</h3>
<p>Peiping - Due to the Japanese issuance of new import and export regulations, foreign commerce in North China is poised to stagnate. There is widespread fear that the commercial fate of American, British, and other foreign businesses in North China will mirror that of the once-prosperous foreign trade in "Manchuria." American and other import/export merchants in this area and in Tianjin are viewing this situation with grave concern and holding little hope for the future. There is a consensus that without government intervention, foreign commerce in this area under the control of the Japanese-led "North China Political Affairs Commission" will inevitably decline. The foreign chambers of commerce in Tianjin and Peiping are currently striving to find a way out of this rapidly deteriorating situation. Although the aforementioned new import and export regulations were promulgated a month ago, the merchants and bankers affected by them still find the interpretation of these regulations difficult to understand. Even the staff of the Joint Reserve Bank, currently tasked with implementing these new regulations, appear to have only a vague understanding when explaining the procedures for obtaining special permits to merchants. The readily apparent consequence is the complete stagnation of foreign commerce. The key points of the new regulations are as follows: (1) Any foreign goods intended for import from countries other than Japan and "Manchukuo" must first obtain a special permit from the Joint Reserve Bank. However, imports of flour, wheat, rice, corn, sorghum, and brown rice are exempt from the special permit requirement. (2) The Joint Reserve Bank will not provide foreign exchange without the aforementioned permits. (3) Those seeking foreign exchange for importing foodstuffs should apply to the Joint Reserve Bank and obtain permission to purchase foreign exchange issued by approved banks.

<p>Manila - According to news received here from Hong Kong, members of the Hong Kong Legislative Council have expressed strong dissatisfaction with the evacuation of women and children from Hong Kong, demanding that the Hong Kong government conduct an investigation and asserting that since the British government ordered the evacuation, it should bear all expenses. One councilor stated that forcing women to leave the territory is contrary to the principles for which we are fighting for freedom and justice, and that certain major evacuation costs appear to be taken from Hong Kong taxpayers. The evacuation also apparently distinguishes between races, which is shameful. A councilor stated that this measure by the government has lost the trust of society. It is reported that Hong Kong society is greatly angered by the forced evacuation. (Haitong Telegraph, 27th)</p>

<h3>US Controls Oil and Iron Exports - Effective August 1st - Horiuchi Inquires of Welles - Formal Report Submitted to Japanese Foreign Ministry</h3>

Aviation motor oil, all high-grade gasoline, light hydrocarbon mixtures, and any products that, after commercial refining, can produce 3% or more gasoline or light hydrocarbon mixtures are included. 2. Aviation lubricating oil. 3. Tetraethyl lead, all pure tetraethyl lead and dialkyl lead oils are included. 4. Iron, steel, and scrap iron, that is, heavy, high-melting-point scrap iron. The order states that the export licensing system announced on July 2nd of last year now applies to aviation motor fuel, tetraethyl lead, and aviation lubricating oil. President Roosevelt said that this licensing system will take effect on August 1st and that this measure is intended for the benefit of national defense. Officials said that this measure is intended to conserve American raw materials to facilitate self-defense programs. The countries most affected by this order will be Japan, Germany, and Italy, as this measure is tantamount to an embargo on them. Japan is the leading purchaser of American scrap iron and purchases large quantities of American petroleum products from the US annually. (United Press, 27th)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt issued a special order yesterday stating that the new regulations for oil export controls are limited to aviation gasoline, lubricating oil, and tetraethyl oil. It was previously known that the last type of oil could be used to refine all petroleum products. Regarding the export permit method for scrap iron, it is said that it is currently limited to number one melting block iron. Even with this restriction, Japan will still be able to obtain large amounts of crude oil, but its air force may feel the pain of lacking high-octane gasoline. (Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<p>Washington - Japanese Ambassador to the United States Horiuchi visited Acting Secretary of State Welles, reportedly discussing the U.S. control of oil and scrap iron exports. When President Roosevelt received reporters yesterday, he stated that this was not a ban but only a matter of national defense. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Japanese Foreign Ministry received an official report yesterday from its ambassador to the United States regarding the U.S. government's embargo on oil and iron. It is expected that the main purpose of this action is to deal with Germany and Italy, but Japan will also be affected. As for Britain, it can still obtain supplies of American oil and iron from Canada. (Haitong Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<p>Embargo Weakens Japan's War-Making Ability - Reveals a New Spirit of Diplomatic Policy</p>
<p>New York - American radio commentators are very interested in the measure requiring export licenses for American oil and scrap iron. It is believed that this is actually a step to prohibit these exports to Japan and Spain. The famous commentator Swine said that the President's action avoided direct hostility towards Japan, thereby eliminating the need for Japan to try to save face, but the effect is the same, as this ban weakens Japan's war-making power. This action is not direct aid to China but represents a new spirit in American foreign policy. Hitler's reliance on mixed oil supplies cannot solve his oil supply problems. Germany does not have enough oil for a long-term war, and its oil reserves will gradually dry up. Another commentator said that the American ban is clear evidence of the cooperation between the US and Britain in blockading the Axis powers. The New York Bulletin reported that Germany and Japan would not welcome this action by the United States but still do not have the ability to retaliate. The listing of oil and scrap iron as prohibited items, along with the blocking of two American oil tankers from sailing to Spain, has revealed that democratic countries can act with a realistic spirit to protect all their interests in the world. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>New York - Since the U.S. abolished the trade treaty on July 26th of last year, the U.S. has inflicted its most significant economic blow on Japan, as scrap iron and iron blocks are under export controls. Production organizations throughout Japan are worried about the impact of this statement, as they will find it difficult to satisfy the insatiable desires of the Japanese military for all the scrap iron and scrap steel. Japan has been apprehensive for months about the U.S. embargo, as these important items are very important for supporting the war against China. All sectors in Japan acknowledge that the U.S. needs to conserve its resources in the current crisis but also feel that the U.S. action is intended to supply more raw materials to Britain and for the U.S.'s own defense needs. It is reported that Japan recently seized 300,000 tons of scrap iron as a blitz tactic in anticipation of the embargo. Last year, Japan took more than half of the total raw materials of scrap iron and scrap steel from the United States, which caused prices to soar and made American industry uneasy. Prices of all items in the U.S. are rising, and there are 14 countries supplying scrap iron to Japan, with the United States supplying nearly 90% of the total, making the situation even more serious. With the outbreak of the European war, ships from Australia, all British territories in the South Pacific, Canada, and India to Japan were interrupted, so Japan had no choice but to rely on supplies from the United States. Authoritative sources say that Japan has not been able to find iron ore and raw materials in China, and neither Japan nor Manchuria has top quality products. It is reported that Japan may turn its attention to the Philippines, but it ultimately lacks a good way to compensate for the loss of exports from the United States.

<p>Granting the Soviet Union a License to Lease Oil Tankers - Makes Japanese in the US Even More Anxious</p>
<p>Washington - American foreign policy, especially its Far Eastern policy, has suddenly changed direction, making Japan think today about whether it can still obtain gasoline, lead, iron, and steel from the United States, which are needed for the war against China. Japanese people here are very bewildered by the President's issuance of the export license order and also by the knowledge that the U.S. government has granted a Soviet company a license to transport oil across the Pacific Ocean on American oil tankers while rejecting the request of a Japanese company. However, President Roosevelt has consistently said that export restrictions are not a blockade but are for maintaining key raw materials for U.S. national defense. Many diplomats believe that the new export restrictions on special raw materials in Europe and Asia may be implemented at any time. The Japanese need a large amount of aviation gasoline in addition to a large amount of military metals. Once these new regulations are implemented, Japan may take testing measures. If metals and gasoline are banned or restricted, Japan will recognize this export restriction order as a blockade. It is believed that U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Welles and Japanese Ambassador to the United States Kenkichi Horiuchi must have discussed the export restrictions and the refusal of the Maritime Commission to allow Japan to use four U.S. oil tankers and two U.S. transport ships for export, but the two sides have not yet discussed the topics they want to discuss. The Maritime Commission, while rejecting the applications of Japanese and Spanish companies, approved the application of a Soviet company to transport goods on U.S. oil tankers less than 24 hours after President Roosevelt took action to place oil and iron under strict license control. The Maritime Commission did not mention a word in the announcement approving the Soviet company's application about the content of the previous notifications rejecting the applications of Japanese and Spanish companies. The Maritime Commission's notifications rejecting the applications of Japan and Spain stated that reserving U.S. oil tankers for trade in the Western Hemisphere was U.S. policy. There is much non-official speculation as to whether this U.S. action is leaning towards a policy of opposing the aggressor countries and helping the Soviet Union by providing more supplies. However, administrative officials have publicly denied these speculations. President Roosevelt only stated during a meeting with reporters that the U.S. announced that placing oil and iron under strict export restriction orders was to maintain the nutrients needed for U.S. national defense. The Maritime Commission said in a statement commenting on the approval of the Soviet application that each application is judged based on the merits and demerits of the case. The fact that the Maritime Commission rejected the Japanese application on July 20th and is now taking action on the Soviet company's application is even more intriguing. The New York World-Telegram reported that the Maritime Commission had rejected the shipment of kerosene to Spain before President Roosevelt issued the order, probably because the kerosene could be transshipped to Germany. The newspaper reported that the Maritime Commission took this action immediately after learning that a Spanish company was using a large number of American oil tankers and was planning to sail to various Spanish ports. A certain Spanish company used seven oil tankers between May 4th and June 8th. (United Press, 27th)</p>

<h3>Soviet-Finnish Agreement Signed - Demarcates the Aland Islands as a Demilitarized Zone - Allows Soviet Troops to Pass Through Finnish Territory to Hanko Port - Finland Ratifies Soviet-Finnish Trade Agreement</h3>
<p>Moscow - The Soviet-Finnish agreement on three issues was signed here on July 23rd by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and Finnish Ambassador to the Soviet Union Paasikivi. Regarding the Aland Islands, both sides agreed that they should be a demilitarized zone. The fortifications built during the Russo-Finnish conflict must be demolished, and Finland must not cede the islands to a third country. Soviet Russia may send personnel to inspect the islands from time to time to see if they have been demilitarized. Although Soviet Russia had a second proposal regarding the island issue, namely that Soviet Russia should cooperate in continuing to build fortifications, Finland did not agree. The second agreement is to allow Soviet Russian troops and military supplies to pass through Finland to the Hanko naval base. The third agreement is to return to Finland Soviet Russian machinery and factory equipment moved from the ceded areas. (Haitong News Agency, 27th)</p>

<h3>Territories in the Western Hemisphere - Cannot Be Violated - Pan-American Conference Adopts the "Havana Declaration"</h3>
<p>Havana - The Pan-American Conference today adopted a "Havana Declaration" stating that the future of European territories in the Americas will be managed. The Pan-American representatives unanimously agreed to the declaration. The declaration solemnly affirms that the Western Hemisphere remains isolated from the wars in Europe and the Far East and that the economic aggression of the Communist, Fascist, and Nazi parties cannot be tolerated. The declaration is a compromise between the US proposal for collective custody of European territories in the Western Hemisphere and Argentina's "wait-and-see" attitude, as Argentina believes that it is best not to take any action unless the territories are actually threatened. This compromise was reached at a meeting of the Peace Preservation Council last night, chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Hull. Therefore, the decision of this declaration must be attributed to Hull. The Colonial Affairs Subcommittee met at Hull's residence at 8:00 a.m. today to begin drafting a fair plan regarding the colonies. The representatives appear to be very optimistic about the outcome of the issue of European colonies in the Western Hemisphere. (United Press, 27th)</p>

<h3>American Journalists in Shanghai - Petition Telegraph - President Roosevelt Announces - Handed Over to Japanese Correspondents' Association</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday that he would hand over the telegram sent to him this week by American journalists in Shanghai to the White House Correspondents' Association. The telegram from Shanghai asked the U.S. government to demand that the Japanese government take responsibility for the safety of American residents in the Japanese-occupied areas of China and to implement the embargo against Japan as announced by Roosevelt on Thursday. The White House Correspondents' Association is a private and non-official organization and has no real authority to intervene in this matter. Therefore, it is believed that the President handed this matter over to the Association in order to brush it aside, but at the same time, others believe that the Association can draw great public attention to this matter. These observers said that the President's remarks to reporters were actually a formal receipt of the telegram sent to him from Shanghai, and that he would no longer make an official announcement on the matter, so that the U.S. and Japan could seek a local solution on the matter. Acting Secretary of State Welles said that he also hoped that the matter could be resolved locally. The White House Correspondents' Association usually has the power to control foreign reporters' attendance at White House press conferences, but at this time, the officials of the Association do not intend to refuse Japanese reporters from continuing to participate in the press conferences as a retaliatory measure. Officials of the White House Correspondents' Association declined to comment on the President's remarks after receiving the telegram. (United Press, 27th)</p>

<h3>Soviet Parachute Experts - Technicians - Red Star Newspaper Praises Them in an Article</h3>
<p>Moscow - Soviet parachute expert Romayek recently published an article in the Red Star newspaper on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the Soviet parachute movement, stating that "The Soviet parachute movement began on July 26, 1930. Since then, the Soviet Union has trained a large number of parachute experts who are known worldwide for their skills. Yeyetenko Timofeyev opened his parachute only after falling 600 meters from the air. His artistry is unparalleled. Due to the invention of automatic machines, the Soviet Union's parachute altitude is unmatched in the world. The jump from 7,445 meters by Kosuyev on July 8, 1935, has been officially recognized as a world record. In addition, Katunov's record is 11,037 meters (August 24, 1937), Kalekonov's record is 12,443 meters (July 23, 1940), and Kostov's record is 7,750 meters (evening of July 24, 1940).

<h3>Roosevelt States America is Willing to Exert Utmost Effort to Help Transport British Children, But Ships Must Be Guaranteed Safe Passage; House Foreign Affairs Committee Also Passes the Bill</h3>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt, at yesterday's press conference, hinted at the possibility of requesting safe passage for ships transporting British refugee children to the United States or Canada, stating that the United States is deeply willing to exert its utmost effort to assist in transporting British children. He can request reasonable guarantees that the refugee children will arrive safely in the Americas. The first step in this matter is to issue passports to approximately ten thousand children; the second step is to ascertain what actions the British government can take regarding the shipment of children to the Americas on British ships; the third step is for the United States to request reasonable guarantees that American ships going to Europe to transport children will not be attacked. A reporter asked for the President's opinion on the American ship transporting British children bill currently under consideration in Congress. President Roosevelt replied that there are three aspects to this issue: first, the attitude of the British government; second, the voluntary effort of the Americas; and third, the safety of the children, with the third item being the most important. Without reasonable guarantees of safe passage, ships flying the American flag and carrying children will bear a heavy responsibility. The sinking of the French ship "Meknes" serves as a warning. A reporter informed the President of a rumor circulating here that the United States, due to British blockade activities, might have to extend its war zone, from which American ships are prohibited, to the coast of Spain. President Roosevelt replied that this is the last open line of communication, and it should be maintained as long as possible. (Reuters, 27th)</p>

<h3>US Aircraft Production to Meet Great Demand; British Request to the Defense Council; Factory Establishment Expenses Being Estimated</h3>
<p>Washington – Knudsen, a leading production expert on the Defense Council, recently stated that according to the plan announced by Lord Beaverbrook, the British Minister of Aircraft Production, for the United States to supply Britain with three thousand aircraft per month, the United States is currently building 38 new factories. It is estimated that this production rate cannot be achieved before June or July 1942. The British Purchasing Commission has requested the US Defense Council to estimate the funds required to establish manufacturing plants at a rate of three thousand units per month. This estimate will be available this week. It is hoped that American production of various types of aircraft, excluding smaller commercial planes, will reach a total of 895 in August, and will increase significantly by October. The aircraft produced in the following months will include military aircraft for Britain (236 units) and the United States (396 units). The Wright Aircraft Company has borrowed $92 million from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to build a new aircraft engine factory, to increase the company's engine manufacturing capacity to approximately one thousand units per month.

<p>Salzburg - The talks between the Romanian ministers and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop at the Fuschl Castle lasted for one hour. Führer Hitler then received the Romanian dignitaries at 4:15 PM, and the talks ended at 6:00 PM. In addition to German-Romanian issues, the question of a new order in Southeast Europe was also discussed. Allied sources claim that Germany's new order in Southeast Europe is based on the welfare of all nations and a solid commercial structure. The first step is to seek cooperation among all countries through peaceful means, and then protect the countries with German power, while promoting the welfare of the entire region. The talks between German and Southeast European politicians in the coming days will all be based on this goal. (Haitong Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Representatives from Poland and Romania are currently in Germany for negotiations. The journal "Berlin-Rome-Tokyo," edited by Dr. Schmidt of the German Foreign Office's Information Department, published an article titled "The Balkan Dispute," which reflects Germany's attitude toward the Balkan issue. Although the author's name was not published, it is generally believed to be a senior official of the German Foreign Office. The article states that Germany and Italy will not use new force or pressure to build a new order in Southeast Europe, but will allow the countries concerned to resolve territorial and ethnic issues with common sense. Germany and Italy's interest in peace and progress in the Balkans, for economic reasons, is the same as the efforts of the countries concerned to build an order that guarantees lasting peace. This goal cannot be achieved by diplomatic trickery, but must take into account the realities of future Europe. (Haitong Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<p>Germany Hopes to Establish Compromise Solution on Dispute Involving Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria</p>
<p>Stockholm - German Führer Hitler is currently busy resolving the Balkan issue, having separately approached Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria in the hope of establishing a compromise solution. Anxious to maintain Germany's position in Southeast Europe, he is proceeding with caution, fearing that other countries might take the lead. However, observers here believe that Hitler has already encountered some difficulties. Regarding the dispute between Hungary and Romania, the issue is simpler, requiring only advising Romania to cede a portion of the Sylvanian province to Hungary. This may be easier to achieve. However, regarding the dispute between Poland and Romania, forcing Romania to willingly cede the entire Dobruja region is not permissible under the circumstances, and persuading Poland to remain silent is also not easy in reality. Moreover, both the Soviet Union and Britain are prepared to support Poland, with Poland being particularly pro-Soviet. If Hitler fails to satisfy that country, it would be sufficient to drive it into the arms of the Soviet Union. In this situation, it is certainly not easy for Hitler to find a solution to the Balkan issue that will satisfy all the countries concerned. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>London - It is widely believed that after being forced to cede Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union, Romania will lose more territory. It is generally speculated that the result of yesterday's meeting between Hitler and Romanian Prime Minister Gigurtu and Foreign Minister Manolescu in Berchtesgaden will be that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will force the Romanian side to cede a narrow strip of western Sylvania to Hungary. The only question to be decided is how wide the strip will be. Semi-official Hungarian sources express the view that Hungary will not be satisfied with a half-hearted solution and that the Sylvanian city of Cluj must be handed over. Some observers say that Hungary will receive its gains in two batches in August and September. Moscow's attitude continues to attract very close attention in Budapest, and Hungary's friendship with Germany is now fully expressed, as Budapest police are currently strictly searching for those who distribute anti-German leaflets and taking action against a group suspected of distributing such leaflets.

<p>Romanian Government Firmly States It Will Not Give Up National Sovereignty</p>
<p>Bucharest - A semi-official communiqué released here states that Prime Minister Gigurtu, accompanied by the Foreign Minister, visited Germany and Italy, expressing Romania's desire to make an effective contribution to the common life of the countries of the Danube and Balkan Peninsula and the maintenance of peace in Southern Europe. They will establish the necessary arrangements in this sense, and will never give up national sovereignty. All claims that Romania is prepared to relinquish its sovereignty are baseless. Romania pursues a policy of peace and is confident that its good relations with its neighbors and major powers will further improve. The entire nation holds a firm determination not to allow national interests to be violated and is determined to protect these interests, and will not hesitate to resort to arms if necessary. The Romanian government is currently fulfilling its peaceful mission with the united assistance of the military and the people. (Reuters, 27th)</p>

<h3>Rumors Abound That Germany Has Prepared Everything; Offensive Against Britain Not Expected to Be Far Off; Anticipated to Peak in Mid-August</h3>
<p>Ankara - According to information received by Turkish diplomatic circles, after lengthy discussions led by General Göring, Hitler's confidant, Germany's offensive against Britain is expected to peak around mid-August. During this period, there will be group air raids on British shipping, along with some necessary preparations. It is also rumored that Hitler expects heavy casualties in the large-scale offensive and has established hospitals in western Germany, with nurses and doctors to be sent from Italy. However, this information must be treated with reservation. Germans are currently discussing their Führer's planned astounding strategy, with various incidents and attempts to spread misinformation likely to occur at the start of the offensive to divert attention and cause confusion. Meanwhile, Turkish opinion remains highly skeptical of Hitler's chances of success, believing that the risky plan he is about to undertake is contrary to the carefully considered judgment of many senior German officers. Some commentators here suggest that Hitler may change his mind, at least for the time being, and decide against the offensive. If so, in order to avoid losing prestige among the German people, he may instead launch a concentrated offensive against Egypt. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3>Germany Launches Group Air Raids on British Convoys; Torpedo Boats Also Active in the Channel; Many British Armed Merchant Ships Damaged</h3>
<p>London - As Germany has intensified its air raids on British ships and cities, the English Channel has become a scene of terrible battles involving merchant ships, warships, and aircraft over the past 48 hours. At least thirty German planes have been shot down in the area, five British small ships and one fishing boat have been sunk, and two British destroyers and several German motor torpedo boats have been damaged. Most of the damage occurred on Thursday when over a hundred German planes launched the most intense attacks on British ships. The German planes, divided into groups of thirty, repeatedly bombed twenty-one coastal ships, resulting in the sinking of five small ships escorted by fishing boats, totaling 5,104 tons, and damaging five ships totaling 5,133 tons. One coastal ship weighing 554 tons was forced to run aground on the beach after being damaged. The news of the above losses was revealed by officials here today to refute the German communiqué's claims of sinking eleven British ships totaling 43,000 tons and severely damaging ships totaling 12,000 tons. Shortly after the German air raids on the convoys, nine German motor torpedo boats came to attack. Two British destroyers and two motor torpedo boats immediately sailed out to intercept them. Upon seeing the British ships, the German boats immediately released smoke screens and retreated. The British ships pursued them, exchanging fire for fifteen minutes, but due to the heavy smoke, the extent of the damage to the German boats could not be determined. Upon returning, the British ships were twice subjected to fierce attacks by German dive bombers, both suffering minor damage, with some casualties among the crew. Subsequently, British planes took to the air and launched a fierce attack. Most of the twenty-eight German planes shot down that day were shot down in this battle. The British fishing boat "Fleming" was sunk by four German planes. When the planes appeared, the "Fleming" was traveling with another fishing boat, the "White Bales". As the "Fleming" sank, the "White Bales" opened fire with its anti-aircraft guns, hitting the German plane's bomb rack, causing the German plane to explode into pieces in mid-air. Another German plane was also hit by the "White Bales" and severely damaged, likely unable to return to base. The survivors of the "Fleming" were rescued by the fishing boat "Corina". Neither the "White Bales" nor the "Corina" suffered any casualties. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3>British Planes Fly Over Germany and Successfully Bomb</h3>

<p>Vatican City - The Vatican officially denied yesterday the news that the Holy See was launching peace talks in London, which was published by the Danzig newspaper. However, the Pope continues to work for peace, and the papal envoys stationed in European countries have all received instructions to carry out peace movements. (Haitong Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<p>Washington - The Dutch Peace Committee has appealed to President Roosevelt to mediate in order to achieve a glorious peace and prevent the destruction of one of the world's two brotherly nations. It is rumored that the Peace Committee is trying to convene an international conference in The Hague. (International Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday that he had not heard of a committee in the Netherlands pleading with him to persuade Britain, Germany, and Italy to call for peace. He also had no comment on when the plan to transport three thousand aircraft to Britain per month would be implemented. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>London - The British government has denied the New York report that Hitler has asked the King of Sweden to propose peace to Britain. Well-informed sources say that it would be absurd to suggest that Britain could consider the peace terms published by the New York Daily News, as the contents of the terms are as follows: (1) The British Empire should be located outside of mainland Europe; (2) Germany obtains Cameroon and former German East Africa, while former German Southwest Africa remains with the Union of South Africa; (3) Germany obtains Belgian Congo; (4) Germany guarantees the British Empire from the "Yellow Peril"; (5) Norway becomes a German province; (6) Belgium is a German protectorate; (7) Germany continues to occupy French territory outside of Paris in German-occupied areas; (8) The Netherlands is a German protectorate; (9) Italy has free movement in Spain and Greece, and obtains land along the Adriatic Sea.

<h3>The German Police Autocrat, Himmler</h3>
<p>The British government has long believed that dissatisfaction and revolution would arise within Germany to overthrow Hitler's autocratic rule. Furthermore, some believed that the peoples of the countries suppressed by Hitler's military force would revolt. Therefore, Germany's long-term war would dissipate the morale of its people, eventually causing Hitler to repeat the mistakes of Wilhelm II.</p>
<p>These fantasies have already been disappointed in the past and will likely be difficult to realize in the future, because there is a man of outstanding intelligence and cruel nature in Germany. This man is Heinrich Himmler, who exclusively controls the police power and commands the party army. The scale of the police force he created is unprecedented. This type of police once helped Hitler rise to power, foiled various conspiracies, and in Hitler's recent war of conquest in Europe, advanced with the army to suppress the resistance of the local people with violence.</p>
<p>Himmler concurrently holds the positions of Supreme Commander of the National Socialist Party's Protective Squadron, Chief of the German Police, and Director-General of the Political Police (Gestapo). His role for Hitler is the same as that of French Police Minister Fouché for Napoleon 150 years ago, but Himmler's ruthlessness and effectiveness far exceed those of 150 years ago.</p>
<p>Among Hitler's aides, Himmler is the least noticeable. He is 40 years old and looks like the principal of a German provincial school. He is of medium height, wears spectacles, and is not suitable for wearing a steel helmet and uniform. He is slow to speak, and only gives speeches when absolutely necessary. Key figures in Berlin value socializing, but Himmler feels embarrassed when he enters a social setting.</p>
<p>Hitler, Göring, and Goebbels have all built mansions, but Himmler still lives with his wife and daughter in a simple small house in the suburbs of Berlin. His wife is a Bavarian farm girl who does not like to order servants around. She mostly does the cooking and housework herself. Himmler works for ten hours every day, and when he has free time, he always amuses himself with his ten-year-old daughter, Gertrud.</p>
<p>I still remember fifteen years ago, when key members of the National Socialist Party were sitting around a table in a Munich beer hall. Hitler was in prison at the time, and party affairs were presided over by Hitler's confidant, Schleicher. Himmler was also present. When Schleicher was lecturing on National Socialism, he put his hand on Himmler's shoulder and said, "Take my secretary—the gentle Himmler—as an example. He handles matters thoroughly. He has an amazing brain for calculating numbers and organizing. However, he will not advance in the revolutionary movement. He is too gentle, and his thoughts and appearance are like an accountant." That gentle Himmler rolled his eyes, smiled, and did not say a word.</p>
<p>However, on a certain night in June 1934, Schleicher and hundreds of old party members were shot dead by the party army commanded by Himmler, which proved that they had misjudged Himmler. In fact, it can be said that all the people of Germany had misjudged him. The gentle Himmler actually harbored an iron will, and his power was second only to Hitler's.</p>
<p>The National Socialist Party's Protective Squadron, commanded by Himmler, consists of 450,000 outstanding young Germans, well-trained and fully mechanized. This Protective Squadron was originally an elite unit of the party army, responsible for guarding Hitler and other important figures, guarding concentration camps, and suppressing internal unrest. Himmler has reorganized it into a regular army, equipped with tanks, artillery, and air force. This type of army served as the vanguard in the offensives against Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, and Belgium.</p>
<p>Recent photo of Himmler</p>
<p>This army is also responsible for "consolidating" the occupied areas of the army through massacres and forced relocation unparalleled in European history. Himmler has served as Director-General of the Political Police for seven years, obeying only Hitler. He can arrest anyone without going through ordinary legal procedures, send them to concentration camps, or sentence them to death. The 2,500 special agents under his command have all been trained in political work in special schools. His assistant, Reinhard Heydrich, has a hideous face and dark complexion, and is known for his cunning and brutality. A large-scale network of spies is deployed in stores, offices, factories, hotels, restaurants, universities, and the army, navy, and air force throughout Germany, engaging in reconnaissance at all times.</p>
<p>The local political police stations receive a lot of information, and the relevant ones are forwarded to the headquarters in Berlin. There are 200 clerks specializing in sorting and classifying work. This type of political police is equipped with special telephones to eavesdrop on news. When major events occur, they conduct investigations, and their power is almost unlimited, but the Protective Squadrons are responsible for carrying out the arrests.</p>
<p>In the past seven years, about one million Germans have been interrogated by the political police and sent to concentration camps, and countless people have died instantly.</p>
<p>Himmler also created concentration camps, which are specifically used to detain Jews and Communists. However, since their establishment, many National Socialist Party members have also been detained for making careless remarks.</p>
<p>What Himmler is most proud of is the Political Police Bureau's foreign affairs division. The 5,000 special agents in this division monitor the relationship between German emigrants abroad and the outside world, and conspire to subvert foreign governments. Several months before Germany annexed Austria and Czechoslovakia, this division of special agents was secretly working in German embassies, consulates, and "travel agencies." Within 24 hours after the overthrow of the Austrian and Czech governments, many important anti-National Socialist figures in those countries were arrested, which was done by these people. They sabotaged transportation lines in Poland and almost kidnapped King Haakon in Norway. The "fifth column" valued by the German army was arranged by them.</p>
<p>Another important task of Himmler is to protect Hitler's own safety. Hitler's bodyguard is an organization of 3,000 tall, absolutely obedient Protective Squadron members. These 3,000 people have all received formal military training. Their black uniforms are exquisitely made and are perhaps the most magnificent team in the world. When Hitler resides in the Berghof in Berchtesgaden, 300 people are responsible for protection. In Berlin, 100 people guard around the Chancellery, and the remaining 2,600 people are stationed in the luxurious barracks in the nearby Lichterfelde district, ready to be summoned at any time. Every time Hitler goes to Austria and Czechoslovakia, they must ensure that the roads he passes are safe. When Hitler appears in public, they must surround him closely. All the movements around Hitler cannot escape the sharp eyes of these teams.</p>
<p>Himmler has the political police as his eyes and ears, and the Protective Squadron as his claws and teeth. His political power is naturally extremely great. The weaknesses and misdeeds of the highest-ranking members of the National Socialist Party have also fallen into Himmler's hands. From Röhm to General von Fritsch, all important figures were killed for opposing him. Himmler has overthrown one army minister and two chiefs of staff. Eight of Hitler's cabinet members wear Protective Squadron uniforms. Göring, Goebbels, and others are cautious in everything before Himmler. Even Hitler must rely on his power.</p>
<p>Himmler was born in a quiet small village called Lindau on the shores of beautiful Lake Constance in the Bavarian Alps. His father was a respected school inspector and devout Catholic who hoped that Himmler would succeed him in his career. This hope was dashed by the last World War. At the age of seventeen, Himmler joined the Bavarian infantry, but he was assigned to clerical work. After the war, Himmler made every effort to oppose the Communists who ruled Bavaria at the time. He joined the National Socialist Party in Munich and was intoxicated by Hitler's words and thoughts.</p>
<p>At that time, when National Socialist Party members gathered, they were often scattered by Communists throwing stones. Hitler thought of organizing a special Protective Squadron, each holding wooden sticks, to drive away troublemakers. This was the origin of the Protective Squadron. Himmler soon joined this Protective Squadron, and by 1927, he was promoted to deputy commander-in-chief, and by his unique thorough methods, he finally trained the disorganized brutes into the most rigorous organization.</p>
<p>By 1929, when Himmler was promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the Protective Squadron, there were more than 100,000 well-trained and well-equipped members.</p>
<p>At the same time, another unit in the party army called the Stormtroopers had also expanded to 1.2 million people. Most of the members were from humble backgrounds, had no discipline at all, were unreliable, and were not easy to command. Commander Röhm was very ambitious. Hitler then discussed with Röhm's backstage old boss, the Rhine industrialists, and army generals, and discussed with Himmler and Göring the method to solve him. The Protective Squadron was dispatched on the night of June 30, 1934, and by dawn, the important figures of the Stormtroopers were caught in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Röhm died immediately, the Stormtroopers disintegrated, and the Protective Squadron and the Political Police became the pillars of Hitler's regime. Hitler also made Göring give up his post as Chief of the Prussian Police, and Himmler was appointed as the dictator of the entire German police. (Excerpt from Current History)</p>

<h3>Uniform Enrollment Hong Kong Examination Situation</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong News Agency) The uniform enrollment examination for domestic public colleges and universities in Hong Kong began at 8:30 am on July 20. The candidates arrived at the entrance of the examination hall before 8 o'clock and waited to enter the hall. At 8 o'clock, the bell rang to open the door, and the students entered in order.

The admission ticket must be presented at the time of entry, and the inspection was also extremely strict. The examination supervisors also arrived one after another at this time. At 8:30, the examination officially began, and the examination supervisors distributed the test papers and test questions. All the test questions were sent from the general office in Chongqing, and it was impossible to know them in advance. The test questions for Hong Kong only arrived by plane at 3 am on the 20th. Five minutes before the examination, the staff and the supervisors jointly opened the package and distributed them. Even the supervisors on the scene did not know what the test questions were. The strictness of the procedures can be seen. The atmosphere in the examination hall was also extremely quiet. The students were all calmly thinking, hoping to achieve the purpose of entering school. It was found that there were about 20 absentees this time, but there were no cases of late arrival or violation of regulations, so the situation was very good. It is reported that the examination papers will be sent back to the general office in Chongqing for review. However, if environmental difficulties occur, it is also possible to mark them in Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>School News</h3>
<p>Lixin Accounting College The Lixin Accounting College held its first new student entrance examination for the 29th year on July 19 and 20. The number of applicants was very enthusiastic. The results of each item have been evaluated and announced. The school's selection standards are very strict, and only 30 new students were admitted, including 26 high school graduates and 4 students with equivalent academic qualifications. It is heard that there is still a balance, and it is planned to continue recruiting new students on August 23 and 24.</p>
<p>China Institute of Technology The Massachusetts Institute of Technology Alumni Association of this port founded the China Institute of Technology, adopting the school-factory cooperation system, which has achieved remarkable results in the American industrial education community. The shortcoming of ordinary schools is that the teaching materials in the school are not enough to meet the actual needs of the society. The advantage of the cooperation system is to clearly understand how to train the talents required by the industrial community, instill the required knowledge in the school, and cultivate the necessary skills in the factory. The electrical service department, cotton textile engineering department, and automobile engineering department of the China Institute of Technology have all signed cooperation methods with the factories founded or presided over by the alumni of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in this port. Continental Swimming School at No. 580 Jing'an Temple Road Continental Swimming Pool, in order to promote sports, a swimming school has been specially established, teaching basic exercises such as treading water, freestyle, and breaststroke in the shortest possible time.

<h3>Grain Prices</h3>
<p>Difficult Times for the People's Food: Rice Prices Plummet Like a Bursting Dam; Over 500,000 Bags in Stock, Over 200,000 En Route; 15,000 Newly Arrived, and Incoming Amounts Still Considerable</p>
<p>The decline in foreign rice prices became even more intense yesterday, plummeting all the way down like a torrent from a burst dam. This is truly a welcome event amidst difficult times for the people's food. Statistics show that prices have continued to fall by as much as two or three yuan. Except for high-grade foreign rice, which is still at 50 yuan, all other mid- to low-grade goods have fallen below the major price threshold. This is due to abundant stockpiles in warehouses, not less than 500,000 bags, and also because 200,000 bags are en route and will arrive in succession. Buyers are not buying, and sellers cannot sell, so transactions are rare. The market prices for all goods have fallen repeatedly without any signs of life. For example, No. 1 old Saigon rice closed at only 52.5 yuan, and No. 2 Saigon rice fell as low as 46 yuan. No. 2 Siam rice opened at 48.3 yuan but also fell as low as 46 yuan, showing extreme weakness. This is because the large batches of orders arriving now are mostly No. 2 Saigon and Siam rice. Compared to the highest price of 65 or 66 yuan at the beginning of the month, this is a drastic drop of 20 or 19 yuan. Other rice types have also fallen by more than 15 yuan. This decline not only exceeds the rice merchants' pricing but also differs by 5 or 6 yuan to 7 or 8 yuan compared to current production prices. This rice price reversal and drop has truly exceeded general expectations. There are still two ships of Siam rice en route. The combined total of arrived and arriving shipments is about 200,000 bags, with a value estimated at tens of millions of yuan. Furthermore, new arrivals require payment upon delivery. Therefore, goods en route are more likely to be soft compared to goods already in stock. The goods loaded on the 26th of last month opened at 58 yuan, immediately falling by one yuan. Then they gradually declined, falling to 56.5 yuan. Ultimately, even at 56 yuan, there were no buyers, so it fell by 3 yuan but still couldn’t stabilize. Previously arrived original packages opened at 56.7 yuan, but no one inquired again. However, about 500 to 600 tons were transacted for back-and-forth trading. Only 4,000 bags are currently available.</p>
<p>Foreign rice continues to arrive. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Qingyuan vessel shipped 10,826 bags to Shanghai from Hong Kong, docking at the company's pier in Pudong for unloading. Also, Jardine Matheson's Fusheng vessel arrived yesterday morning, carrying 4,340 bags from Hong Kong, docking at the Roosevelt Pier for unloading. Additionally, there were 110 bags originally destined for Yantai. Furthermore, 328 bags were loaded in the city to be transported to Yantai. Large quantities of foreign rice are expected to arrive in port in the coming days. (Zu)</p>
<p>Although deliveries of domestic japonica and glutinous rice have been sparse, the overall market situation has deteriorated, and foreign rice is being sold off sharply. The unofficial trading prices have also declined in unison. The quoted prices are more than two yuan lower than before. Changbang Qinggeng Fresh Special is 65.5 yuan or 65 yuan, Wuxi Qinggeng is 64 yuan, Changzhou Su Kun japonica is 62-63 yuan, and inferior grades are around 58 yuan. Early Bo Dao rice has not yet been released, and early Nangang He is 56-57 yuan. Glutinous rice Jinli goods are around 61 yuan, and Changdan goods are 58-59 yuan. Hong Kong white rice has not yet been quoted.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Transactions Holding Back</h3>
<p>Ultimately, Prices Are Too High</p>
<p>Flour: Transactions were quite sluggish yesterday. Because it was the weekend, both local and out-of-town buyers were hesitant. On Mok Street, although the factory price had been revised to 5 jiao, it was still considered too high. Local sales were further weakened by the dumping of cheap Japanese flour, causing demand to stagnate further. Therefore, the buyers' price for Grade 2 Zhengpai flour fell to below 17 yuan but still lacked buyers. The wholesale price on this street remained at 15.5 yuan. If the harvest of wheat on Mok Street increases in the future, there is a possibility of further decline. Other Japanese factory flours, such as the Phoenix brand, have attracted the attention of re-export buyers after days of price reductions and sales. It is said that there is an intention to raise prices for recycled goods. The market is currently holding steady.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, because inland production prices were reported to be down by one yuan for several days, the amount stored and arriving in Shanghai gradually increased. Factories took advantage of this to frequently reduce prices. However, cargo owners, having acquired their goods earlier at high cost, were unwilling to devalue them further. Moreover, with it being the weekend, both buyers and sellers were in a state of resistance. However, with rice and flour prices falling, it is feared that the market will ultimately have difficulty standing its ground. In the end, the Hua Factory only purchased about 1,000 bags of Su Kun wheat at a price of 21.5 yuan each.</p>

<p>Foreign Exchange Futures</p>
<p>More Active Buying</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed rates. The unofficial markets for British and American currencies showed a slight weakening in a quiet environment. This was due to active buying interest from foreign firms, and the supply of chips was slightly less than demand, causing prices to tighten slightly. However, the environment still did not show significant changes, and it was difficult to generate momentum. Speculators were very active in purchasing forward contracts, so the trend was easier to tighten. Today, the spot USD rate was quoted at 6.09375 after 9:45, and the initial rate for the pound sterling was 3 shillings 8.875 pence. However, the noon close remained flat, ultimately closing at 3 shillings 8.90625 pence for the pound sterling and 6.09375 for the USD, a decrease of 0.015625 and 0.03125 respectively compared to the previous close. Futures were similar.</p>
<p>British and American Currencies Slightly Tightened</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London long rate increased by 0.1875 and the forward rate increased by 0.0625. New York silver prices remained flat, and London gold remained stable. The British-American exchange rate remained unchanged, and there was no market for French currency. The USD increased by 1.5 points against the pound, decreased by 3 points against Shanghai currency, and there was no market for French currency. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained the same. Banks opened the spot selling price in the morning at 3 shillings 8.90625 pence for British currency and 6.125 yuan for the USD, with the USD flat and British currency tightening by 0.015625 compared to the previous day's closing price. This was due to a slight rebound in the exchange rate. Initially, foreign firms came to sell, but both foreign and domestic firms were keen to absorb them, so the initial situation was flat. The USD rate for this month was 6.125. The HSBC listing was revealed to be unchanged, and the silver balance tax was revealed to have increased by 1.25%. Although American firms also came to sell, the buying interest from foreign firms was quite strong, so prices weakened slightly. The American firms sold this month's USD to foreign firms, retreating to 6.09375. However, there was no change in forward contracts. Chinese speculators purchased August USD at 6.0625 from British bank McCallie, and foreign firm Sassoon also purchased August USD at 6.0625 from the same bank. It was heard that the softest spot rate for the pound sterling was 3 shillings 8.875 pence, but the closing price returned to flat. The USD was also very stable. The British currency closed at 3 shillings 8.90625 pence, the USD at 6.09375, the August British currency at 3 shillings 8.875 pence, and the USD at 6.03125. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Slight Fluctuation in the Weekly Foreign Exchange Market</p>
<p>The range of fluctuation in this week's foreign exchange market has become smaller. The British currency is 0.0625 and the American currency is 0.09375. Changes in the British exchange rate have always been slower. As in the previous week, it was only 3/32. The American exchange rate has changed more rapidly due to changes in the British-American exchange rate. For example, in the previous week, it was still 15/32. The overall trend of foreign exchange this week is that the British exchange rate has risen slightly. The highest price for the USD, except for the closing price on Saturday, was 6 and 5/32. The closing price was 6 and 3/32. The difference between the spot rate and the July forward rate and the August rate is 1/64 for the British exchange rate and 1/16 for the American exchange rate for the entire week.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Rises Very Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold unofficial market saw fluctuations between 5,300 yuan and 350 yuan. Sentiment can be said to be firm, with rises and advances, and interest is strong. Moreover, the foreign exchange market slightly reported weakening, and selling pressure was significantly reduced. The initial opening was only 5,320 yuan, and the Qian Dui industry gold shop took the lead in selling, pushing it down another 20 yuan to a low of 5,300 yuan. Subsequently, the two sides suddenly changed hands and advanced again, and the price returned to 5,350 yuan. As a result, they closed with a surplus settled at a high price, retreating to 5,332 yuan as the closing price, an increase of 4 yuan compared to the previous day. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday. Nearly 1,000 taels were traded in half a day. Silver jewelry prices remained unchanged, and customs gold, etc., remained flat.</p>
<p>Red Gold Up Four Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, the exchange rate reported an increase per bar (ten taels), and sentiment was slightly tired. When it opened, the Qian Dui industry first sold, and it was immediately pushed down by 8 yuan. The Qian Dui industry issued 30 taels to the securities group, at 5,320 yuan. As more sellers gradually emerged, the gold shop group also followed suit and sold, so it gradually fell to 20 yuan. The Qian Dui industry issued dozens of taels from the silver shop, yielding 5,300 yuan. However, at that time, the buying households were quite strong, and the decline was immediately stopped. Moreover, soon the silver shop group suddenly came to frantically drag, coupled with the Qian Dui industry stopping selling and switching to buying, because the foreign exchange was slightly tight, and before long it rose by 50 yuan. The silver shop advanced 30 taels to the gold shop, at 5,350 yuan. Unexpectedly, after this, the number of buyers decreased, and the price fell again. Moreover, the Tianjin group and the surplus all had sales, and it had retreated to 5,323 yuan near noon. Later, the foreign exchange market reported weakening, and the silver shop group came back to search and enter again, and then raised it by several yuan again. The silver shop advanced 20 taels to the same industry, at 5,332 yuan, as the noon closing price. As a result, it was 4 yuan higher than the previous day. There were 50 yuan fluctuations in half a day. The selling price of cash shop gold, according to the gold shop's own brand, was several yuan higher according to the red gold, and the purchase was reduced by 30 yuan, which was very tight. The current marked gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few openings.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Not Seen to Hang High</p>
<p>The exchange of jewelry gold per tael has not changed. Da Tong Hang still hangs the original price of 550 yuan. The new counterparts are similar to the previous price, and the purchase is reduced by 30 yuan, which is very tight.</p>
<h3>Most Foreign Currencies Reported Gains</h3>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Bullish Action</p>
<p>Yarn Prices Rebound</p>
<p>Double Horse Reaches 956 Yuan</p>
<p>The yarn market, which had been hovering for many days, showed a significant turnaround and improved yesterday. This is because there were again bullish rumors in the market. Generally, the bulls, seeing the market inactive for a long time, took action. At the same time, although there was no large-scale development in actual transactions in Hong Kong, there were still many scattered purchases. Therefore, everyone bought a few packs, and the surface slightly tightened, and the market rebounded. In short, the market has been hovering for a long time and has a tendency to move after a long period of stillness. Because inventories are still sufficient, there is no fear of soaring prices in the future.</p>
<p>The morning opening for current yarn showed a slightly stable trend in the market atmosphere. However, the majority of scalpers have mediocre thoughts, so transactions were not strong. The opening price was 940 yuan. Unexpectedly, few sellers offered at this price. A certain Feng brand came to purchase again. At the same time, the spot sales in Hong Kong were not weak, and sentiment tightened. It was also heard that drafts were slightly tighter, and the bullish momentum was strong, gradually rising to a closing price of 956 yuan. The half-day transaction statistics showed 2,580 packs transacted, with the price of 20-count Double Horse rising by 20 yuan. Today, 250 pieces of yarn will be transported to Siam, and 1,714 pieces will be transported to Hong Kong. The amount of purchases made by each group is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Same Trade 1,830, Hong Kong 690, Inland 60, Total 2,580</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Remains Quiet</h3>
<p>5,200 Bales of Indian Cotton Arrive</p>
<p>Spot transactions were slightly more active, but factory acquisitions have not yet developed. However, sentiment is slightly inclined to be firm because the foreign cotton market is also hovering. This stabilizes the sentiments of those with cotton on hand. At the same time, the yarn market has risen, and raw cotton has stabilized accordingly. 300 bales of fire machine cotton were transacted among the same trade at a price of 153 yuan. 300 pieces of Indian cotton at 205 yuan were transacted in warehouse delivery.</p>
<p>According to another source, the foreign cotton market in New York initially declined due to a lack of significant buyers and improved reports on the cotton area climate. In addition, due to reduced spot demand, the closing price fell by 3-5 points compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market rose by 10 rupees due to speculation, along with predictions of price increases.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton market was quiet throughout the day. All parties maintained a wait-and-see attitude. Only one or two factories slightly purchased a small amount of missing cotton, but the amount was extremely small. The market inventory is not abundant, and those with long fibers are the most abundant. Japanese manufacturers are quiet. It is generally expected that transactions will take place next month.</p>
<p>A large batch of Indian cotton arrived in Shanghai. The Yaja Company's Hirila vessel arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, carrying 5,200 bales from Calcutta, docking at the Qichang warehouse in Pudong for unloading.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Class A is the Most Popular</p>
<p>The securities unofficial market turned firmer again yesterday. Customers gradually found interest in buying goods, although the number was not large, but this was enough to encourage people on the narrow surface. The price of Class A stocks was the most popular, exceeding 3 yuan again yesterday, only a little bit away from the highest price on the 16th. Other types differed more from the recent high prices, so the market price with interest during the period was not easy to fall. Yesterday morning, Renchang and Tongkang absorbed more. No. 35 and Hengfu Lianyi both absorbed. Lemao sold some. Hongda sold Class B and bought Class C. Datong, Runli, and Jiufeng all had sales, but the market price was still very firm. In the afternoon, Lianhe bought a lot of Class A. Dakangcheng specialized in buying Class E. Others, such as Defu, Gongmao, and Shuntai, all had considerable interest. Therefore, even in the sales of Yichang, Shengda, Lianyi, and Jiufeng, the market price continued to advance. The market situation is gradually improving. Summarizing the results of one day, all bonds rebounded by 2.5 to 4.5 jiao, with a total transaction volume of approximately 900,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>

<h3>Financial Commentary</h3>
<p>— Sheng</p>
<p>— To July 27th —</p>
<p>The exchange rate of the British pound, since August 1939, due to the British declaration of war against Germany, the market price has rapidly declined. At the closing price on the London market, it fell from about 4.68 on August 24 to about 4.48 on the 25th, fell to 4.19 on September 2, and fell further to 4.02 on the 5th. Therefore, on September 14, the British government stipulated a legal price to sell U.S. dollars at 4.02 and buy U.S. dollars at 4.04. From then on, the London pound exchange rate became stable. It rose to 4.025 on January 6, 1940, and has not changed since. However, on the New York market, the pound exchange rate fell very quickly. At the closing market price, it fell from 4.68125 to 3.85 in the five months from August to December in 1939. Therefore, a free pound came into being on the foreign financial market. After the Foreign Exchange Control Ordinance was implemented on March 25, 1940, the decline in the free pound market price became even more rapid. It was seen at 3.15 yuan in April. On June 8, the foreign exchange rule was strengthened, and the free pound market price slightly improved. The market price statistics from 1939 to July 26, 1940 are recorded below:</p>
<p>1939</p>
<p>August 4.68 4.29</p>
<p>September 4.26 3.82</p>
<p>October 4.06 3.96</p>
<p>November 4.00 3.85</p>
<p>December 3.96 3.90</p>
<p>1940</p>
<p>January 4.00 3.93</p>
<p>February 3.99 3.93</p>
<p>March 3.94 3.53</p>
<p>April 3.58 3.46</p>
<p>May 3.50 3.15</p>
<p>June 3.87 3.19</p>
<p>July 3.91 3.66</p>
<p>Although British wartime foreign exchange has been tightened three times, it has still been unable to prevent the decline in the free pound. According to estimates by the London "Economist" magazine, the amount of free pounds used accounts for only 5% to 10% of Britain's total foreign public and private income and expenditure. Therefore, there are two opinions on the existence of free pounds: those who support the existence of free pounds say that the trend of the pound market price in the informal market does not need to be interfered with and should be allowed to find its own equilibrium level. If there is an excessive decline, it will promote British exports, encourage the repayment of debts owed by foreigners, and as a result, it can correct the excessive decline. However, those who oppose the existence of free pounds believe that the decline in the pound is detrimental to Britain's financial and political reputation, and the harm to British international trade is even greater, because the decline in the free pound now cannot have the same effect on promoting exports as in normal times. The quantity of wartime exports depends on how much surplus there is after domestic needs, and the relationship between the high and low exchange rate is lighter. As for foreigners purchasing pounds to repay debts, if the free pound trend is unstable, debtors will instead wait and see and wait for a more favorable free pound market price in the future to purchase pounds for debt repayment. Therefore, some people suggest that if you want to ban free pounds, you can only find ways to reduce their source. As a result, there are strict foreign exchange control measures on June 8.

<h3>US Bans Scrap Iron and Gasoline Exports</h3>
<p>Taking Action Instead of Warnings</p>
<p>The Export Licensing System Has Broad Significance</p>
<p>People of Insight Should Not Ignore This Move</p>
<p>(Woodhead's Insightful Remarks)</p>
<p>The English-language "Great American Evening Post" carried an article yesterday by Woodhead discussing the de facto embargo on scrap iron and gasoline by the United States, stating that Washington's announcement that exports of scrap iron and gasoline would require special licenses has broad significance. This movement has been vigorously promoted by powerful figures in the past few months, mainly as a gesture against Japan. American sympathizers of China have urged the government to implement an embargo, saying that the United States' protests against Japan's indiscriminate bombing of China, especially endangering the lives and property of Americans in China, is contradictory while the United States continues to supply the Japanese government with scrap iron and gasoline.</p>
<p>Tension between the US and Japan Creates the Situation</p>
<p>It is now understood that the US is implementing an embargo, not only to limit such goods from falling into the hands of Japan, but also to prevent them from being transferred to the Axis countries through Spain. Therefore, the export licensing system is about to be implemented, and it cannot be seen as anything other than the result of the increasingly tense and serious relationship between the US and Japan. This is not only due to the continuous incidents in Shanghai arousing widespread anger in the United States, but also to the trade restrictions implemented by the Japanese in North China, causing foreign import and export trade to suffer the equivalent of an embargo. Japan protested against the US's moral embargo on limiting important war supplies, while at the same time excluding American commerce in North China. The illogicality is self-evident.</p>
<p>Oil Tankers to Japan Denied Licenses</p>
<p>The US government has already refused to issue permits to oil tankers heading to Japan, which is just another step in refusing to ship oil to Japan and Japanese-occupied areas. The Japanese Konoe Cabinet is now seeking to completely reform the country's foreign policy. The content is still to be announced, but it is generally believed that it will likely involve joining the Axis powers and expressing a tough attitude towards Anglo-Saxon nations. Some Japanese extremists are openly advocating challenging the US, but it remains questionable whether Konoe and his foreign minister are inclined to this view. However, it cannot be denied that some Japanese in China are openly taking dangerous actions that are detrimental to the United States.</p>
<p>Effective Warning, Unable to Sit Back and Watch</p>
<p>Although a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy claimed that Japan had not adopted an anti-American attitude, the facts cannot be denied. Japanese troops in Hangzhou participated in the distribution of leaflets "demanding that the United States withdraw from East Asia" and threatened that "after the new Japanese cabinet is formed, it will take other steps to deal with [the United States]." How can it be denied that the anti-American movement has official support? The US President's decision to take action and extend his embargo powers to US oil and iron exports is a warning that sensible people in Japan cannot ignore. This matter clearly demonstrates the official anger over the recent incidents in Shanghai and other parts of China that have affected Americans. Nanjing actually demanded the expulsion of six American expatriates, placing the situation in an extremely dangerous situation. The violence and anti-American movements committed by Nanjing in Shanghai are in line with the widespread flood of anger in the United States.</p>
<h3>Negotiations on the Resumption of Navigation of German Ships in Zhejiang Waters</h3>
<p>No Results Yet</p>
<p>According to Lulin &amp; Co., Results May Be Seen by the End of the Month</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Zhejiang shipping line, which has been blocked for nearly half a month, has had more than 20 foreign ships stop because of the unsuccessful negotiations by the relevant foreign parties. Since the German shipping companies in Shanghai submitted a request to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with Japan, as of yesterday afternoon, according to the news from the shipping department of Lihe &amp; Co., there were still no results from the negotiations, so the hope of resuming navigation for ships such as Mofu Hai Fu was very small. However, according to German Lulin &amp; Co., the negotiations may be expected to yield results by the 30th of this month, so whether the company's Gaodeng vessel will go to Likang Port and whether the Feikang vessel, which recently returned to Shanghai from Wenzhou, will sail to Wenzhou again may be announced by the 30th of this month. As for the British-owned Shenfu vessel of Yilong Co., which left Shanghai for Fujian ten days ago, there is still no news.</p>
<p>Customs Clearance Difficult to Approve</p>
<p>Because the Jianghai Customs received a notice from the Japanese Navy that foreign ships are prohibited from completing customs clearance for ports blocked in Zhejiang and Fujian. According to senior customs officials of Western nationality, since the Japanese Navy has imposed a blockade there, unexpected events may still occur even if the customs release the ships. Therefore, for the safety of passengers and cargo traveling to the coastal ports of Zhejiang and Fujian, the ban on stopping customs clearance cannot be lifted until the notice of lifting the blockade from the Japanese Navy is received.</p>
<p>Haimen Navigation Affairs</p>
<p>Haimen in Zhejiang is also subject to the ban on navigation. Moreover, it is not a fallen area, so Japanese commercial ships cannot navigate there. The report that the Huadong vessel of the Huadong Shipping Bureau sailed to Haimen is actually a misreport.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Administration of the Eastern District is Decaying; Foreigners Protest; Police and Sanitation are Ineffective; Foreigners Agree Not to Pay Taxes</h3>
<p>A certain newspaper reports: Several foreigners residing in Lane 609, Ward Road East, in the mountainous area, recently told a reporter that if the authorities do not provide adequate police protection and sanitation services, and remove the corpses exposed in the lane, they are determined not to pay municipal taxes. One of the foreigners reportedly said that beggars die every night in the neighborhood around them, and no one collects the bodies. He had been robbed twice recently and had not seen any patrolmen. Moreover, garbage trucks do not come regularly, and they never come when it rains. They have repeatedly protested to the local police station, but to no avail. Therefore, they will not pay a penny in taxes until the situation improves. However, a group of houses there is inhabited by German refugees who have recently arrived in Shanghai and dare not take any action, so they are still paying taxes on time. A Western woman also said that she was recently robbed of her handbag by bandits in broad daylight in the middle of the road, and there were no patrolmen around, so she could not call for help. There are more and more beggars' corpses exposed in the lanes, and swarms of flies gather, which is a serious threat to the health of the residents of the district.</p>

<h3>The Gas Company's Labor Strike; No Negotiations; Rumor Has It That Various Parties are Mediating; The Company Has Not Heard of It</h3>
<p>The spokesperson of the British Gas Company issued a statement yesterday, saying that the company is currently training a new batch of employees to replace the old employees who sympathized with the workers and went on strike together. All employees are now being reorganized and foreign employees are being placed among them to prevent the same situation from happening in the future. The factory section is currently being maintained by temporary Russian and Jewish workers. The strike and the situation remain the same as when it first started. The workers and the factory have not held negotiations. The rumor that the negotiations have broken down is not true. The company is also unaware of Yu Qiaqing or the Municipal Chamber of Commerce mediating. According to what was known yesterday, since the workers went on strike, the gas sales loss of the gas company is about 40,000 yuan per day. In addition, the cost of temporary Russian and Jewish workers is 3,000 yuan per day. The strike of Chinese employees has caused the company to hire another 160 people to replace them. The loss is only 320 yuan per day.</p>

<h3>Tong Shiheng, Manager of Zhufeng Enamel Factory, Was Kidnapped Yesterday; Bandits Ambushed in Front of the Factory Gate on Binlang Road; Seized Tong and the Car When He Came Out</h3>
<p>At the gate of the Zhufeng Enamel Factory on Binlang Road, Shanghai West, at 10:43 AM yesterday, a kidnapping case suddenly occurred. The kidnapped person was Tong Shiheng, the manager of the factory. As a result, three bandits jumped into Tong's car No. 6369 one after another and drove west towards the Chinese area. The details of the investigation are as follows:</p>
<p>Just Stepped into the Car; Bandits Emerged</p>
<p>Tong Shiheng, styled Jitong, is from Jiading, 57 years old, and resides at No. 24, Jingucun, Aimeiyu Road, Jin Shenfu Road, French Concession. He is the manager of Zhufeng Enamel Factory. As usual, Tong took car No. 6369 to the factory on Binlang Road to work at about 5:00 AM every day. At about 10:43 AM yesterday morning, Tong finished his work in the factory and planned to return to his residence to rest. When he was about to leave the factory gate, Chen Kecheng (50 years old, from Nantong), the gatekeeper of the factory, saw ×× leave and opened the car door. Tong stepped into the car. Just as he was closing the car door, three bandits suddenly emerged from the side, all dressed in short clothes and holding guns. They rushed up. The car driver, Jiang Jintai (over 30 years old, from Yancheng) pretended to step on the engine immediately and drove west. Jiang witnessed the situation and knew that things were not good. Although he was under duress, his movements were deliberately slow, which caused the bandits to be dissatisfied and drag Jiang down.</p>
<p>Bandits Drove the Car; Speeding West</p>
<p>Another bandit stepped into the car and drove it himself. Because the engine was not easy to start from time to time, the other two bandits helped push the car body and forced several pedestrians to help push the car. After about four or five minutes, the car started to move slowly and sped away to the west. At this time, the gatekeeper Chen Acheng ran back to the factory and shouted, "The manager has been kidnapped!" He immediately reported to the Gordon Road Patrol Station by telephone. When the police officers arrived, the bandits were gone. They investigated everything at the scene and then took the car driver Jiang Jintai and the main gatekeeper Chen Acheng to the patrol station to strictly interrogate the situation of their master being kidnapped and the appearance and clothing of the bandits, so as to find clues to apprehend the bandits.</p>
<p>The Reason for the Kidnapping; Under Investigation</p>
<p>According to the reporter's investigation, the distribution office of the factory is located at No. 228 Aiduya Road (i.e., the intersection of Sanyangjing Bridge and Jiangxi Road). Tong is good at drawing Chinese maps and is famous in the education field. He used to work in the Commercial Press and was in charge of drawing maps. He once served as a director of the Pudong Electric Company. The car No. 6369 that Tong usually rides is not his own car, but the official car of the Pudong Electric Company. Because Pudong fell after the war, the car was temporarily borrowed and has been used for three years. The factory was originally located in Gujiawan, Zhabei. After the two wars of "January 28" and "August 13", the losses were quite heavy. It then moved to its current address on Binlang Road. Recently, due to soaring raw material prices and sluggish sales, the factory's business has been hit hard. As for the reason for Tong's kidnapping, whether it is a simple kidnapping for ransom or related to political kidnapping, the patrol station is investigating.</p>

<h3>The Russian Team of the Merchant Corps is Being Merged; Deployment is Still Pending; After the Merger, the Team's Mission is Similar to the White Russian Team in the French Concession</h3>
<p>The *Shanghai Times* reports that the Municipal Council's Economic Committee's interim report recommending the merger of the Russian Team of the Merchant Corps into the Police Department has been approved by the Council. However, according to senior officials of the Police Department, it is still unknown what the maintenance plan or funding of the Russian Team will be after it is merged into the Police Department. According to an official of the Municipal Council, the details of what kind of mission the Russian Team will undertake, what uniform it will wear, and whether it will continue to have rifles and bayonets on duty,</p>
<p>or be equipped with pistols</p>
<p>and other details have not been agreed upon. However, he believes that the main purpose of the Economic Committee's recommendation is to improve the efficiency of the Russian Team and the internal security of the International Settlement. On the one hand, it seeks movement, building a prison barracks on Xiamen Road, estimated to cost about 175,000 yuan. It will be at least four or five months before the new barracks are completed and the Russian Team moves from its current rented houses on the Bund and Jiujiang Road to the new barracks before it is merged into the Police Department. Regarding the uniform, there is no definite information, but it is believed that the members of the Russian Team will temporarily wear</p>
<p>the original military uniform</p>
<p>because it would cost a lot to make new uniforms for 300 people, which is not in line with the exchange policy. It is heard that after the Russian Team is merged into the Police Department, it will undertake a mission similar to that of the White Russian Auxiliary Team of the Police Department in the French Concession, and its salary will be the same as the amount it currently receives in the Merchant Corps. The complete plan for the future work of the Russian Team will be formulated by Police Commissioner Colonel Bao Wen after he returns to Shanghai from a short vacation. The Economic Committee's report states that members of the Russian Team will still have the same opportunity to be transferred to the Reserve Team in the future, and will be gradually trained and promoted. The police training work of the Russian Team will be the responsibility of Deputy Police Commissioner Robertson, who is in charge of the Reserve Team. The current officers of the Team will remain in their original positions.</p>
<h3>More Than 100 US Marines; Come to Shanghai to Relieve Troops; The Chaumont Sails to Beidaihe</h3>
<p>The US Manpower Transport Ship Chaumont, which left the US San Diego Naval Base at the beginning of this month for its last Far East voyage, entered the port at 3:30 PM the day before yesterday and berthed at the US Navy pontoon in the Huangpu River. It also carried more than 100 US Marines to Shanghai to relieve the troops. They disembarked and boarded military vehicles to the US military camp for stationing that night. After mooring in Shanghai for one night, the ship set sail for Beidaihe in North China. On the 15th of next month, it will come again to carry the US Marines who have completed their service in Shanghai back to the United States.</p>
<h3>Mr. Chapalain, Director of the Shanghai Post Office; Departs to Return to Shanghai; The Mail Inspection in the French Concession; The Situation Will be Clear When Mr. Chapalain Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Whether the incident of the Japanese side requesting to inspect mail at the post office branch in the French Concession can be resolved will be clear after Mr. Chapalain returns to Shanghai. According to the reporter of Datong News Agency, the Japanese side recently suddenly attempted to send inspectors to the Masnan Road Post Office branch in the French Concession for inspection, and it was scheduled that two Japanese inspectors would be accompanied by the bureau's patrolmen on the 23rd to inspect the residence of the Masnan Road Post Office. However, there was no result. Whether this matter will be implemented will be clear after Post Office Director Chapalain returns to Shanghai, and Mr. Chapalain has also departed from Hong Kong on the Taikoo Company's Yusheng Wheel yesterday and is expected to arrive around the 30th of this month. It is speculated that the Japanese side's motive for inspecting the mail at the Masnan Road Post Office is obviously to check the mail delivered by the branch itself within its area, because this mail does not go through the Administration Bureau but is delivered by the bureau itself. At the same time, the area delivered by the Masnan Road Post Office is much wider than other branches in the French Concession.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong's Preparedness is Still Strict; Overseas Chinese Form Self-Defense Corps; Guns Will be Issued to 5,000 People Nationwide; The Protection of Telecommunications Institutions in Hong Kong is Strict</h3>
<p>The situation in Hong Kong has temporarily eased, but the authorities' preparedness has not been relaxed. According to a person from Hong Kong who spoke to a reporter from Pingming News Agency yesterday, the area is still in a state of war. Most of the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong have been evacuated. The interests of the Chinese are the most closely related, so they have agreed with the Hong Kong authorities to form a self-defense corps. The funding is raised by enthusiastic people. The entire corps has 5,000 members, all of whom are Chinese, and the Hong Kong authorities will issue self-defense guns to help maintain local law and order in emergency situations to make up for the shortage of police force. The organization is currently being prepared by leaders from all walks of life in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>(Protecting the Telegraph Bureau)</p>
<p>In addition, in order to prevent bad elements from breaking into the telecommunications institutions and attempting to sabotage them, the Hong Kong authorities have taken precautions for the Ministry of Communications, Great Eastern, and Great Northern Telegraph Bureaus. No outsiders are allowed to enter. Even those who go to send telegrams can only contact at the door and cannot directly enter the bureau as in the past.</p>
<p>(Intensifying Air Defense)</p>
<p>As for the authorities' air defense equipment, they are making active efforts. In addition to establishing an air defense class, where Chinese people and students from various schools go for training to meet the needs, the consulates of various countries and the important military and political institutions, as well as the large and small buildings concentrated on the mountains of Hong Kong, are all disguised with grass-green paint.</p>
<h3>A Large Gang of Bandits; Organize a Gun-Robbing Party; The Main Nest is Located in Caojiadu; Many Patrolmen's Guns Have Been Robbed</h3>
<p>The English-language *China Press* reports that it has been heard that there are 80 to 100 bandits in the city who have formed a gang specializing in robbing patrolmen of their official guns for the purpose of robbing residents in the Western District. The Police Department of the International Settlement is aware of the existence of this bandit gang and believes that the bandits have a main nest near Caojiadu, off Jessfield Road. It has been investigated that in the past five months, no less than ten official guns of patrolmen on duty in Jessfield and its vicinity have been robbed, which is probably done by this bandit gang. Its main purpose is to confront the patrolmen of the International Settlement. The price of the robbed guns can be sold for more than 500 yuan, and the bandits can also keep the guns for their own use because there is a shortage of guns in Shanghai at the moment. It is believed that the various robbery cases that have occurred in the Jessfield area recently were committed by this bandit gang using the robbed official guns. In the past five months, the Jessfield bandits have only failed in one gun-robbing incident. This case occurred on Wednesday, when a Chinese patrolman was forced into ×× by bandits and his gun was robbed. Fortunately, the patrolman was alert, snatched back the gun, and injured a bandit. It is heard that the police authorities will officially commend the patrolman's bravery.</p>
<h3>Shooting Incident in Shanghai West; British Army Issues a Statement; Major Aishmore Checks the Soldiers' Guns and Ammunition; Proves on the Spot That Not a Single Bullet is Missing</h3>
<p>The *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reports that just after 10:00 PM last night (the 26th), British military officers, police officers of the International Settlement Police Department, members of the Japanese Brigade, and important members of the "Municipal Police Bureau" arrived at the corner of Yidingpan Road and Da Xi Road to investigate an incident in which a "Municipal Police" officer on duty at the location claimed that a British sentry had fired four shots. The British military authorities last night</p>
<p>(Issued a Statement)</p>
<p>stated that according to the investigation conducted on the spot, none of the British soldiers on duty at the two posts there fired a gun. It can be seen that the "Municipal Police's" statement is completely groundless. This has satisfied both the Japanese Brigade and the officials of the "Municipal Police" Bureau. Previously, a "Municipal Police" officer on duty at the location pointed out that a British sentry had fired a gun. Several other "Municipal Police" officers echoed this. The commander of the British sentry team at the location</p>
<p>(Reported Immediately)</p>
<p>to the headquarters. Major Aishmore and several other British military officers, along with the Japanese Brigade of the Police Department and officials of the "Municipal Police" Bureau, arrived at the scene. It was pointed out that the British army at the location was not equipped with guns. Major Aishmore also checked the soldiers' guns and ammunition and saw that not a single bullet was missing. After the investigation was completed, the Japanese Brigade and officials of the "Municipal Police" Bureau expressed their belief that the British army had not fired a gun. According to people in the vicinity of the intersection of Yidingpan Road and Da Xi Road at about 10:00 PM last night, several gunshots were heard at the time, but it was believed that the shooting location was far from the intersection of the two roads.</p>
<h3>Xu Guansheng; Sued for Seduction; Ma Nangeng Also Sued for Forced Signing; Defendant Claims That the Plaintiff is a "Goddess"</h3>
<p>Zhang Chen, a 61-year-old woman from Hangzhou, residing at No. 10 Haining Road, recently sued Xu Guansheng (35 years old, from South Zhao, residing at No. 44, Lane 383, Latour Road, currently the manager of South ×× Tobacco Company) and Ma Nangeng (31 years old, from Danyang, lawyer, No. 13, Bei Yongji Lane, Wangzhi Road) in the Criminal Court of the Special Court of the French Concession, accusing them of conspiring together to</p>
<p>(Abandon a Helpless Woman)</p>
<p>and attached a civil suit demanding 48,000 yuan in alimony. According to the complaint, Judge Tian Liweishan of the court opened a criminal court for trial yesterday afternoon. According to Zhang Chen, my niece Tang Wenying (20 years old this year) has died of her parents and is under my guardianship. Unexpectedly, she was seduced by Xu Guansheng and lost her chastity, and they cohabited. As a result, Xu falsely claimed to have signed a marriage certificate and tricked Wenying to Ma Nangeng's office, forcing her to sign a divorce paper. Therefore, I am suing the two defendants, requesting legal action. Then, according to Tang Wenying, in the 27th year of the Republic of China, I came to Hong Kong</p>
<p>to make a living</p>
<p>and happened to go shopping at the New World Company. I met Xu and was tricked into opening a room and lost my chastity. About a week later, we rented a house and cohabited. Recently, he made a new love and abandoned me. Therefore, my aunt came forward to file a lawsuit. Xu Guansheng confessed, In the spring of the 27th year of the Republic of China, I opened the Dajiang Hotel on Tianjin Road. A waiter introduced a business runner, Tang Wenying, to me and I stayed with her.</p>
<p>(Paid for the Night)</p>
<p>The next day, we parted ways. However, in June of that year, we met at the Wing On Company and rekindled our old relationship. She asked me to rent a house with her and we cohabited in various places such as No. 87, Shanjia Garden, Baker Road, and No. 7, Taichen Road Lane, Xiafei Road. I paid her more than 100 yuan per month for living expenses. On May 6 of this year, both parties voluntarily separated, so we signed a document at Lawyer Ma's office and I paid 600 yuan to settle the matter. The waiter of the Dajiang Hotel at that time and the second landlord of No. 87, Shanjia Garden, can prove that Wenying</p>
<p>(is indeed a goddess)</p>
<p>Finally, according to Ma Nangeng, this matter has nothing to do with me. Both parties voluntarily separated from their cohabitation relationship, so they asked me to make a contract and sign it in duplicate. There was no coercion. The court verified the words and decided to reschedule the hearing and summon ××.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Puller Beats Passenger to Death; Puller Tries to Evade Responsibility</h3>
<p>Han Lanqing, a 44-year-old Shanghai resident living at No. 5, Huai'an Fang, Pudong Road, Xujiahui, Shanghai West, hired Jiangbei native Tao Awu (35 years old, residing at No. 18, Shimin Village, Hongqiao Road) at the iron gate at the intersection of Hongqiao Road and Haige Road at 9:00 AM on the 26th. He hired Tao to pull his rickshaw to the Xujiahui Road tram station in Xujiahui Town for some business. Unexpectedly, Tao mistakenly thought that Han was going to take the tram to Shanghai, so he took a shortcut out of laziness, pulling the rickshaw through the iron gate and east along Route des Soeurs to the Yao Bishop Road tram station. From start to finish, the journey was only about thirty storefronts long. Han then argued with Tao, leading to a quarrel, which then escalated into a physical altercation. Tao punched Han once in the chest, causing internal injuries. Han collapsed to the ground. The police arrived and arrested Tao. Han was sent to Guangci Hospital but died before he could be treated. The body was sent to the Tongren Zhuan Yuan Mortuary for an autopsy. Yesterday, Prosecutor Zhao from the Special No. 2 Court was notified to examine the body, which confirmed that the death was caused by injuries sustained from the beating. Tao Awu confessed during the interrogation, saying, "The deceased slapped me in the face, and I raised my hand to block it, and he immediately fell down. I didn't hit him back." However, no family members of the deceased have come forward. The authorities have ordered the Benevolent Hall to handle the burial of the body. The defendant has been handed over by the police to be dealt with.</p>

The kidnappers arranged to meet at the entrance of the Guanghua Cinema on Avenue Edward VII on the 20th. The person who came would carry an umbrella as a marker. At the appointed time, Zhou's family sent a representative to meet with the kidnappers, and they agreed on a ransom price of 9,000 yuan. They scheduled another meeting for the afternoon of the previous day at 7:00 PM at the same location. Unexpectedly,</p>

<h3>Xiangmao Soap Factory Robbed; Employee Bravely Captures Thief; Follows Closely and Seizes Opportunity to Tackle Thief; Thief Fires One Shot, Fortunately Missing</h3>
<p>At 3:40 PM yesterday, four robbers suddenly arrived at the office of the Chinese Xiangmao Soap Factory, No. 6, Hongren Lane, Tianjin Road. They broke in through the back door, threatened the factory employees with guns, forbidding them from making any noise, and locked them in a room, guarded by one robber with a gun. Another robber forced the employees to hand over the key to the cash box, opened it, and robbed more than 700 yuan in legal tender before fleeing. One of the employees, being quite resourceful, secretly followed the robbers. When they reached No. 505 and the entrance of the Jin Building near Xianbo Road on Henan Road, the employee bravely stepped forward and tackled one of the robbers. The robber pulled out a Mauser pistol and fired one shot, fortunately missing. At this critical moment, the employee bravely knocked the gun out of the robber's hand. The two then engaged in hand-to-hand combat. The employee's face was bitten by the robber, covered in blood, but he still held on firmly, shouting for help. When the nearby patrol officer heard the commotion and arrived, they immediately captured the robber alive, along with the Mauser pistol, and brought them to the police station for investigation.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Dear Sir, I was surprised to read the news in your newspaper on July 27th about the alleged embezzlement by the assistant manager of the Tianquan Machinery Engineering Company. The company was dissolved as early as the first of this year. Mr. Geng, out of jealousy that Wen Jiang formed another company, has repeatedly tried to obstruct and hinder him, and has repeatedly reported the case to the police alleging encroachment. However, after Wen Jiang provided strong evidence, the police thoroughly investigated the false accusation and refused to accept it. Now, he has fabricated another incident and made a false accusation to the court. As for the statement in your newspaper that "the evidence submitted by the defendant in court was found to be untrue," it is not in accordance with the facts. The allegations made by the plaintiff and the evidence provided by the defendant are sufficient to prove that the plaintiff knew that the allegations were false and untrue, and had the suspicion of deliberately framing the defendant, so it is necessary to summon witnesses to prove the case. Right and wrong will be determined by the court. This matter is of great importance to my business and reputation, so I am writing this letter to request a correction in your newspaper.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Sun Wenjiang</p>

<h3>The American Summer</h3>
<p>— Translated from the New York Times by Bo Ming</p>
<p>People all over the world undoubtedly consider the power and resources of the United States to be second to none. However, they cannot help but have some doubts about the nerves of Americans. The American in their minds is simply someone who, all day long, does nothing but "make money," without a moment's rest, like a headless fly, flying around everywhere.</p>
<p>In fact, these impressions are completely superficial and come either from newspapers or books, or from fleeting glimpses during travels to the United States, seeing only the extremely tense emotions of Americans in a few big cities. As for worshipping money and seeking wealth, it is human nature, but after the American Civil War, the idea of "getting rich quick" became stronger among Americans. At that time, many "adventurers" built fortunes from scratch, becoming millionaires. Europeans, after reading their autobiographies, biographies, or anecdotes, naturally felt that these people were just money-grubbing, reckless types.</p>
<p>In reality, the leisurely enjoyment and natural ease of Americans have been gradually improving over the past five or six decades, and there has been a significant transformation in their social life. Just considering their summer life, it has changed from a change in climate to a change in psychology.</p>
<p>Economic development and educational advancement are two factors that have caused major changes in American summer life. Since the evolution of summer hotels and summer clubs, the activity increases almost every summer. Over the years, American society has become increasingly prosperous, and most people can afford a car, transforming it from a luxury item for a few to a necessity for the masses. As a result, the most important travel tool has become a common possession in every household. Mountains and watersides, as long as there are scenic spots, can be reached from morning to night, almost without limit. Those who used to view travel as a nuisance can now do as they please and never tire of it.</p>
<p>Travel can increase knowledge, change the environment, and is the only way to absorb various new materials. As a result, many people use this long summer vacation to catch up on their studies and increase their knowledge, especially students and university professors, who use the good environment and extra time to engage in education and academic cultivation.</p>
<p>The American summer is quite long. From the end of June to the beginning of September, three months of summer vacation can be used for traveling, relaxing in the mountains, by the water, or in small rural villages. As long as you have a car and some money, you are qualified to move to the countryside. Because of social prosperity and industrial development, the increase in personal assets and leisure time has led middle-class Americans to start having two homes to adapt to their annual lifestyle. Surprisingly, during the economic downturn from 1929 to 1932, this comfortable lifestyle was not affected. On the contrary, tens of millions of unemployed people spent most of the year living in rural areas or cabins in the forests, which actually saved on expenses.</p>
<p>Summer life is diverse, ranging from individuals to groups, each differing according to environmental conditions. There are families where the head of the household works at a university. Frugal families, during the summer months when school is out, and the husband has nothing to do, will get a flat-bottomed boat, load it with daily necessities, hoist a sail, and slowly cruise on the inner lake, all the way to a secluded island to spend the summer. Only when the autumn wind blows, and the frost falls on the leaves, do they return to the city. There is also a lady who works for a publishing company. Her actual vacation time in the summer is very short, only about two weeks. Every Saturday afternoon and any day she is free, she parks her car in front of the door and drives away, going wherever she pleases, until dusk, when she finds lodging in an inn. Ladies and women who are accustomed to social life, who used to frequent dazzling and extravagant places from 10:00 PM to 12:00 AM, are also idle in the summer. They are often found in the kitchens of village houses or in mountain gardens, doing gardening work.</p>
<p>There are two special features of American summer life that go hand in hand with cars, property, and leisure time, becoming a unique situation in summer life anywhere in the world. The first is children's summer camps, which have a long history and have become a national industry. If you include the number of Boy Scouts camping, at least two million American children participate in this kind of summer camp life every year. According to a 1933 survey, there are no fewer than 3,485 such organizations nationwide. Their locations are either by the water or in the forest, lasting from six to eight weeks. Originally, these beautiful environments and good facilities, such as lakeside and mountainside huts, and the leisurely life of fishing yachts, were only enjoyed by the wealthy children whose fathers and brothers were rich. Now, middle-class families can also enjoy this blessing by paying a small fee. On the one hand, after parents send their children to summer camps, experts will manage them, without them having to worry about it themselves. On the other hand, the couple can spend a few happy weeks in the countryside or faraway villages without any burdens.</p>
<p>The rapid increase in children's summer camps is certainly related to the growth of the social economy, but it is not simply due to the pursuit of leisure and enjoyment. In recent years, many middle-class families have moved from the countryside to the cities to make a living. In the summer, the children are still stuck in high-rise buildings of twenty or thirty stories or running around in the streets and alleys, and neither their bodies nor minds benefit. As a result, the summer camp business has sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain.</p>
<p>The second feature is summer schools. The scope of these summer schools is very wide, ranging from formal university courses to writing or dance schools set up on mountaintops or in pine forests. All kinds of education are available, too numerous to mention. Now, more and more young children are going to university, so they certainly cannot let this good summer pass in vain. They must take advantage of the opportunity to get their children more education. On the one hand, because the social and economic situation has improved, sixteen-year-old youths of school age no longer need to do odd jobs in the summer to subsidize their tuition. As a result, the need for summer schools is more developed than in previous years. As for adults, many people who have no free time throughout the year can take advantage of this opportunity to use the beautiful environment to catch up on their favorite or needed subjects. Therefore, in essence, the so-called summer school is just a collective that combines rest, education, work, and society into one.</p>
<p>American summer life occupies a very important position psychologically. As Europeans have witnessed, any American city is filled with tense and urgent emotions, all kinds of noises, constantly intertwined telephones and telegrams, middle-aged women's busy social lives, young mothers' painstaking efforts to find everything beneficial for their children, the tense situation of door-to-door salesmen, the sharp cries of newspaper vendors, and the stimulating scenes in movies—how can such a life not make people's heads swell and their nerves extremely tense? However, Americans have their own plans. When they are busy, they really cannot breathe, but the pursuit of leisurely summer vacations and reclusive lives is also superior to others. Out of the twelve months of the year, they actually only work hard for nine months, and the remaining three months are this leisurely summer life. Most middle-class people, especially urban residents, after nine months of long-term struggle, have more than twenty weeks of rest. The fact that Americans' nerves can be kept normal is certainly largely due to this summer life.</p>
<p>In the nineteenth century, European writers and Americans themselves agreed that Americans' nerves were extremely tense and becoming weak. Just look at the appearance of Uncle Sam, with his long face and pointed chin—this is a sign of neurasthenia. But today's Americans have changed from that dry and tense long face to a rosy and round face. The thin faces of women have also become much broader and fuller. Although there are still many advertisements for medicines on the market to treat colic and constipation, these diseases are no longer a concern for Americans.</p>
<p>Europeans who travel to the United States rarely stay for a long time in the summer, so they only see the tense emotions of Americans, but they do not get to experience the wonderful summer life. The leisure of summer really has some poetry in it. Even taking driving as an example, driving through the fields in the summer, going up and down a hillside slowly, with white clouds overhead, and the countryside full of fun, when he stops, he can fully appreciate the wind and scenery between the fields and forests. Even for women, during this season, because heavy makeup is too hot, they naturally wear some light clothes. They don't play cards or listen to lectures, they just do some comfortable and natural daily life.</p>
<p>The most prosperous New York originally had no so-called vacation, but when summer comes, the scene also changes greatly, like a woman who is in love, her clothes, appearance, and demeanor, there is no place that is not changed. At midday, the streets already have a leisurely look. Cars on the elevated Park Avenue are only quiet and peaceful, and they do not roar. Children on the sidewalk are alone and grand, as if they were the owners of the place. Doormen are only wearing undershirts, sitting on the stones along the street to rest. Clerks in department stores are too lazy to even sort out their clothes. Most women are leaning on the window, listless.</p>
<p>When summer comes, Americans become the most carefree and natural people. Without fatigue, without aging, restoring vitality, maintaining youth, and dispelling the tense emotions of winter, they are preparing to welcome the new world of early autumn. As long as they see a red maple leaf and hear a cricket chirping, the energy that Americans have restored and stored in the long summer will begin to move forward on the path of endless life.</p>
<h3>German Tanks and Their Tactics</h3>
<p>The second weapon of the new German tactics, namely the concentrated attack of tanks, is, like the development of its air force, also a product of recent years. General Velpry, former Director of Armored Forces in France, once said, "There has been no progress in tanks and their use for fifteen years! This is because Germany has no such weapon."</p>
<p>Although this statement may be an overstatement for the German military authorities, it only reveals a portion of the truth. Because the German army was not allowed to use tanks for fifteen years, during which only a few prototypes were built, this also meant that they were not bound by traditional tactics. Once the time was right, they could do as they pleased. By 1933, they were able to develop the various powers of tanks according to a completely innovative plan.</p>
<p>The armies of other countries, especially the French army, still view tanks as auxiliary weapons for infantry, so they continue to be bound by the pace of infantry, and tank units are evenly distributed to the army. The new German army is different. From the beginning, it decided to remove the shackles on tanks, break them away from auxiliary weapons, and make them independent weapons, forming powerful divisions, purely with concentrated and rapid special power, breaking through enemy lines and turning the entire battle into a mobile war.</p>
<p>In the first few years of German military restructuring, they concentrated on the mass production of light tanks, following the precedents of the Soviet Union and Italy. These tanks weighed six tons, were equipped with two machine guns, had armor less than six-tenths of an inch thick, and had a speed of 35 miles per hour.</p>
<p>These tanks, in the Spanish Civil War, encountered the government army's weak anti-tank guns and slightly heavier Soviet tanks, and the results were very poor. The Germans learned from this lesson and completely changed their strategy. The result was seen on April 20, 1938, at Hitler's birthday parade, when new light tanks weighing eight or ten tons had been created. In addition to machine guns, they were also equipped with an eight-millimeter cannon. Another type of medium tank weighed 18 to 25 tons and was equipped with a 1.5-inch or 1-inch cannon, with five soldiers per vehicle.</p>
<p>At the same time, the German Krupp factory was also testing a giant tank weighing 100 tons, equipped with one 4-inch cannon and two 3-inch cannons, 12 to 15 machine guns, 19 soldiers, and armor about 4 inches thick. The two giant tanks created by the Germans in 1918 can be compared. These tanks weighed 150 tons, were equipped with four 3-inch cannons, two machine guns, 22 soldiers, and armor less than 2 inches thick, and were never used by the Germans.</p>
<p>Currently, German war teams are based on the above three types. In 1935, three divisions were formed. By the end of 1938, this had expanded to five heavy mechanized divisions, each division with two tank regiments, each with 200 tanks, supplemented by motorized infantry, artillery, engineers, signalmen, and supply troops. By the time of the Polish War, the number had increased to at least six divisions. Currently, it has increased to 12 divisions, with a total of about 5,000 tanks, including 500 heavy tanks, 2,000 medium tanks, and 2,500 light tanks. In addition, there are so-called "fast divisions," the number of which is unknown, each with 100 light tanks, supplemented by armored vehicles, motorcycles, motorized artillery vehicles, and motorized infantry. These "fast divisions" are used to replace the cavalry of the past.</p>
<p>The victory of the German tank units in Poland and France was partly due to the power of the giant heavy tanks, but the main reason was the special training of the German army in extremely sensitive tactics, which were developed by the army into concentrated attacks and large-scale tactics. This kind of tactics can only be used freely by a large standing army that has received systematic training in peacetime, and can never be carried out by independent tank units and auxiliary teams combined?</p>
<p>Tanks must not only destroy machine guns, as they did in the last war, but also destroy anti-tank guns and other anti-tank weapons, such as mines and obstacles. Therefore, the formation of tanks during an attack is quite complicated and must be divided into several successive batches, each with special tasks and objectives. The first batch is the heaviest tanks, used to break through the enemy's important gaps and positions. The second batch is medium tanks, which are the main force of the attack. Their special task is to destroy the enemy's anti-tank guns, and they must use the terrain to drive forward quickly, and if possible, also use pincers to attack from both sides or the front and rear. The third batch is mostly light tanks, mixed with a small number of medium tanks. Their main task is to destroy the enemy's machine guns, so that infantry and special motorized artillery teams and other troops can follow.</p>
<p>Although this tactic focuses on speed and surprise, its purpose is not only to rush through the enemy's formation, but its most important thing is to break the enemy's resistance with superior firepower. When German tanks clash with enemy tanks, their tactics focus on the most important point, that is, first aim and fire at the enemy tanks. According to the experience of the last war, this point has been proven to determine victory or defeat. After German tanks successfully attack enemy tanks with firepower, they begin to advance. In other words, they use firepower control, action adjustment, and use all their strength to pounce on the enemy's weaknesses, seize local advantages, and try to defeat the enemy.</p>
<p>Tanks are mainly based on concentrated attacks, and other various troops are in an auxiliary position and must be used selectively and at the right time. However, the cooperation of aircraft is very important. Aircraft can assist tank commanders in reconnaissance of the terrain from the air, and bombard and strafe the enemy army to assist the first batch of tanks in combat, and can also deal with enemy air counterattacks and assist tanks in pursuit.</p>
<p>This kind of mobile warfare has a great impact on the individual tactics and strategies of the German army. On the one hand, German infantry is different from that of France and the Soviet Union. The other countries have received strict training, and they can use their own heavy weapons without the assistance of tanks, so that tanks can concentrate their attacks. On the other hand, this kind of concentrated attack, that is, the main force of the attack with heavy tank teams attached to motorized infantry, is definitely different from the main force attack with infantry alone. The German army's sweeping advance in the Western Front this time is clear evidence of this.</p>

<h3>Old News Re-copied Sixty-Seven Years Ago (458) (See Original Newspaper from the Twelfth Year of the Tongzhi Reign of the Desolate Qing Dynasty)</h3>
<p>A Song of Encouraging Relief</p>
<p>Natural disasters occur, in every dynasty and country. The states of Lu, Wei, Yan, and Qi occasionally reported famine. It breaks my heart to see the people of Jin suffer, why must Heaven burden them alone? The drought is severe, and the good harvests have been long gone. The fields are without green grass, and nine out of ten homes are empty. People have faces like cranes, and the fields are as barren as tortoise shells. Gold is like dirt, yet it's hard to exchange for even a little grain. Who weeps in the rooms? Young children and old men. Who weeps on the roads? Maidens and widows. Husbands cannot protect their wives, and children are separated from their mothers. Empty stomachs lead to collapse, and hunger gnaws at the intestines. People eat human flesh to stave off hunger, and plaster their mouths with stone powder. Starved corpses line the roads, one doesn't know how to handle it. And it is reported that this year, whether rain will come is unknown. Spring planting is all withered, and the autumn harvest cannot be relied upon. Looking back at the regions of Jiang and Han, accumulated rice forms mountains. In years of prosperity, everyone is joyous, grains are abundant. But few good people are afraid of lagging behind in disaster relief. Don't delay, quickly prepare grain and dried provisions. Performing good deeds brings blessings, this theory is not flawed. Burying a snake and saving an ant, one can gain fame. The Sui pearl and jade rings, their rewards can be seen. Burning bonds and buying righteousness, tying grass to repel invaders. These examples are recorded in history books, countless and clear. How much more so for the disaster-stricken people, the merit lies in saving them. In June, frost flies, and there is no rain for three years. I urge the governing officials, making righting wrongs your priority. The Golden Valley is turned to ruins, and the Copper Mountain remains only as earth. I urge those with wealth, what difficulty is there in opening your purse? The benevolence of a gentleman, it extends for five generations. Human life is only a hundred years, who can be like Peng Zu? Looking back at your descendants, they may be like dogs or tigers. Only blessings can be planted, only virtue can be established. Secret blessings bring good fortune, and the gods will surely compensate. Don't imitate the money-grubbers, who only know how to hoard. Just look at natural disasters, how can much gold cure them? It breaks my heart to see the people of Jin, hundreds of thousands of households. Saving from disaster is an urgent matter, do not sneer at the foolish and simple.</p>

<p>My Teacher: There is more than one teacher, so be sure to write the teacher's name and the subjects they teach. The most important thing is to clearly describe the teacher's personality, and to write your feelings about them sincerely, but do not criticize them. As for the order of arrangement, you can choose freely, but the entire article should have a few concluding remarks, either general first then specific, or specific first then general, either way is fine. If you particularly admire a certain teacher, you can focus on that one, with the others as supporting characters. This kind of writing is more difficult.</p>
<p>Hometown: This topic is best to expand on. In addition to writing the location, name, and local customs, you can make a comparison between before and after the war. If you haven't been back, you can inquire from relatives and friends, and then write your feelings.

<h3>Overcoming the Darkness</h3>
<p>Children, hurry up and go to sleep! It's getting late. "Mom, I'm scared." Every night, countless children are saying, "Mom? I'm scared." Afraid of what? Afraid of the darkness. So children who are innocent and carefree during the day, when they go to sleep at night, or when they need to get something, they have to be accompanied, and are unwilling to go alone. Children, why do you have such a mysterious and unpredictable attitude towards darkness? Why is the fear of darkness even more severe than the harsh words of teachers or the beatings of parents? What exactly is the reason? I will now divide it into two points: First, in childhood, things are fun, and children often don't want to go to sleep. Even if they are forced to go to bed, they toss and turn and refuse to close their eyes. So the mother or maid scares you by saying, "If you don't sleep, the tiger will come." Or other things you are usually afraid of. You immediately believe it to be true, and are forced to fall asleep. After this happens once or twice, a terrible shadow is etched in the child's small mind. Because these frightening words are all said at bedtime, so every time you lie in bed and can't sleep, you think of tigers! Terrible people! The more you think about it, the more scared you become, looking around, all is pitch black, and you can't help but feel your hair stand on end, gradually developing a timid mentality. Second, in the evening, the family members are all free, so they chat about everything, especially liking to talk about demons and ghosts. Children who hear this become suspicious and fearful. Because in the darkness they cannot clearly see the outlines of objects, occasionally hearing a sound or mistaking an object, they mistakenly think it is a ghost. Parents also think that being afraid of the dark is a child's nature, and without waiting for the child to ask, they accompany them early on, constantly suggesting the terribleness of the darkness, without even realizing it themselves. This feeling of being afraid of the dark is deeply rooted in the minds of young children, and is not removed until they are fourteen or fifteen years old. By the time they are around twenty years old, they still don't dare to go alone to empty places. The creation of this fear weakens the courage of children and buries the spirit of independence.</p>
<p>Children! How can we overcome the darkness, how can we drive out the shadows in our minds? The most effective method is to ask grandmothers and mothers to stop telling ghost stories to avoid harming younger siblings. The proactive method is to personally observe the things that we find suspicious. For example, in the darkness, it seems that we see something white. At that time, you don't have to run away, turn on the light and go to that place to look, and you will know that what is hanging there is a white piece of clothing or a piece of cloth. Your doubts will immediately disappear. After a long time, you don't need to turn on the light. As soon as you hear a sound, you will guess that it is a mouse gnawing on something, and you will no longer be suspicious and fearful.</p>
<p>The latter method is very difficult at first, so you may want to ask someone to accompany you to observe. After your own experience increases, you will know that ghosts don't exist, your doubts will disappear, your courage will be strengthened, and you won't be afraid of anything. Children who are afraid of the dark, try this method!</p>
<h3>Two Teapots</h3>
<p>— Jin Zhen</p>
<p>It's so hot! As soon as they finished breakfast, Ah Hui's mother took him and his brother, Ah Ming, to visit relatives, because the morning was relatively cooler. If they went out in the afternoon, the sun would be as scary as a man-eating tiger. After a short stay at the relative's house, they planned to start their journey home.</p>
<p>His mother conveniently bought a teapot for making tea on the way, which caused a debate between the Ah Hui brothers.</p>
<p>The thing is this: They stepped into the pottery shop and saw at a glance that various teapots were placed in the corner of the display window, and two of them were of the same width, but one was tall and one was short, but their spouts were the same height. After all, which teapot can hold more water? This question became the starting point of their argument.</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly, the taller teapot can definitely hold more water. If you don't believe me, go call the boss in the store and ask him which one is more expensive? The taller one must be more expensive, because it can hold more water." Ah Hui said incessantly, seemingly very reasonable, and the boss's reply made Ah Hui's claim even more solid, truly adding fuel to the fire, so the reason could be established, and Ah Hui's victory was determined.</p>
<p>"No need to argue strongly, let's use facts to prove whether I'm right or you're right?" Ah Ming also refused to give in, and he already had a plan in mind. He put the two teapots flat on the table and asked the boss to bring a basin of water. He also took a teacup, filled it with water, and poured it into the two teapots. He first poured water into the lower one, and as the water gradually filled, he continued to pour it into the taller one. Just as the water was about to reach the mouth of the teapot, Ah Hui saw the water overflowing from the spout, so he poured the water out of the two teapots, and the result truly made Ah Hui dumbfounded.</p>
<p>"The fact is like this. Next time, you can't just make such careless remarks without thinking and think you're very certain. Now you know why it doesn't match your ideal? When you pour water into the taller teapot, you can only pour it to the limit of the teapot's spout. If you pour in more, the water will overflow from the spout, because the spouts of the two teapots are the same height. So the lower teapot is indeed the same height as the spout, and a teapot that is any larger can hold the same amount of water. Whether in the teapot or in the spout, the water is always on the same level. If the spout is only this high, then no matter how tall the body of the teapot is, you can't fill the body with water, because once it's full, the water will overflow from the spout, so the water capacity of a teapot only depends on how high its spout is. This is completely a matter of level."</p>

<h3>Shirley Temple's Autobiography (12)</h3>
<p>Gokan, let me tell you about my work in the Education Film Corporation short films. The first film was "So Glorious," which was filmed in the summer of 1932. I was only three years old then. Mother took me to the studio. She wasn't as excited as she was at my first screen test, but she was very happy in her heart. Although she was calm on the surface and didn't show anything, I knew that she had always hoped that I would enter the film industry. Now that her wish had been fulfilled, how could she not be happy? And I guessed that when she was a little girl, she herself would have liked to enter the film industry.</p>
<p>In this first film, I had very few lines, only about twelve lines, and half of them were in French. All I did was a song and dance, shaking my shoulders to the rhythm of the music, and rolling my eyes as if making flirtatious glances. My body was also like the female star Doris Lee Elio, who wore a short mesh shirt in "So Glorious" and exposed one shoulder.</p>
<p>But do you know what I did in the film? I actually kissed two boys, something I had never done before in my life. And not just one, but two boys! So you can't say I didn't have any lovers. Those two boys, one named Erqi En Bader, and the other named George Smith, were both around four years old. Although they were still wearing diapers, they were both very handsome. They both wanted to marry me, and I immediately agreed after kissing them. But I don't know what they are doing now, because we haven't met since we parted in that film.</p>
<p>Since that film, I have also performed many love scenes. As soon as I saw Miss Denon, I fell in love with him. I played the main role in the great film "Stand Up and Cheer," and he was also in it. As soon as he saw me, he also fell in love with me. According to him, he loved me more than any other woman in the world. I believe him, do you believe him too? One day, in front of my mother, he picked me up and kissed me!</p>
<p>Next was Mr. Leon Barrymore, whom I also loved. He played an old soldier in my film "The Little Colonel." Actually, he himself wasn't that old, so he wore a snow-white wig. Although I liked him in my heart, I didn't dare to say it out loud, for fear that the old man would frown at me. I asked my mother what I should do. My mother said it didn't matter. If he heard that I liked him, he might be very happy. So I waited for an opportunity to explain it to him.</p>

<p>Anecdotes of the Peking Opera World</p>
<h3>Two Anecdotes about Tan Xinpei Zhongheyuan Angrily Beats Prince Qing Entertaining the Court, Teasing Lang Deshan</h3>
<p>In the late Guangxu period of the desolate Qing Dynasty, Tan Xinpei, the owner of Yingshutang, established the Tongqing troupe in the Zhongheyuan inside Qianmenwai Liangliangdian, and its business was booming, becoming the champion of various gardens. One day, Prince Qing, accompanied by his family, went to Zhongheyuan to watch a play. It happened that the garden was extremely popular that day, and when the prince arrived, all the seats in the upper floors had been reserved. Even a small box was impossible to find. The prince was very disgruntled and forcibly occupied the box of another guest and sat down. The staff argued with him, but he refused to listen and ordered his soldiers to beat them severely. At this time, Tan was putting on makeup backstage, and he became furious when he heard the news. He refused to show weakness and led the crowd to fight back, injuring the soldiers and Prince Qing. Knowing that he was no match for the crowd, the prince staggered back to his mansion. He was still angry and immediately issued an order to seal Zhongheyuan without permission to vent his anger. The next day, Empress Dowager Cixi summoned Tan to perform in the palace. Tan refused to go, which shocked the Empress Dowager. She quickly ordered an official to inquire at Tan's house. Tan told him about the events of last night. The official truthfully reported back to the Empress Dowager. The Empress Dowager said, "How can the Prince be so unreasonable?" She then ordered a courtier to summon the Prince and reprimanded him. On the other hand, she sent someone to comfort Tan and sent Han Dalaoye, the commander of the Nine Gates, to personally unseal Zhongheyuan at two o'clock that evening with lanterns lighting the way. Only then did Tan dress up and enter the palace to thank the Empress Dowager. When the Empress Dowager saw Tan, she comforted him with gentle words and criticized the Prince's actions. From then on, Tan Beile's prestige spread throughout the nine cities and became unmatched. Chen Shitou personally told me about this incident before he died.</p>
<p>At that time, the Jing performer Lang Deshan was like a newly unsheathed blade, shining brightly and very famous. One day, he was paired with Tan Xinpei in the inner court to perform "Catching and Releasing Cao," and his skills were evenly matched, and his reputation was excellent. Tan was quick-witted and knew that Lang was a Muslim, so he suddenly changed "Killing a Pig to Sell Wine" to "Killing an Ox to Sell Wine." Empress Dowager Cixi was very surprised. After the play was over, she summoned Tan to inquire. Tan replied, "Lang is a Hui person and does not eat pork, so I replaced it with beef." The Empress Dowager was very pleased to hear this and praised him greatly. That day's main performance was Tan's "Stealing the Soul Bell." Before going on stage, Tan said to the crowd, "Please all of you sing with me in this play, so we can receive rewards from the Empress Dowager later." All the famous actors gladly agreed and played the role of Pigsy, and Lang was no exception. When Pigsy ordered the little pigs to cry out, the others all made pig noises, but Lang made a goat bleating sound. Tan shouted, "My little pig can bleat like a goat." The Empress Dowager was greatly amused and rewarded them generously. This is also one of the anecdotes of Yingshu's offering to the inner court.</p>
<h3>The Cast of Meng Lijun</h3>
<p>A Mr. from Guohua Company said: "Meng Lijun" may have Spring Bright's production first, but our efforts and resources invested in this film exceed any Guohua production before. When it is released, it should have excellent returns. For example, the cast includes Zhou Xuan, Shu Shi, Xu Feng, Ji Jianong, You Guangzhao, Yuan Shaomei, Zhou Qi, etc., which is also unprecedented in Guohua productions. Therefore, when this film is released, it should be refreshing. (The picture above is one of the scenes in the film)</p>
<h3>Fei Mu and Ying Yin Oppose Joining the China United Film Factory to Make Movies</h3>
<p>Ying Yin has been in Shanghai for half a year, and recently she seems to have become silent. It is said that the greatest expectation of Hezhong for Ying Yin is to star in "Empress Dowager Cixi," but the script has not been completely finished. Hezhong is unwilling to let Ying Yin be revealed before discovering a script more moving than "Empress Dowager Cixi." It is said that Fei Mu had already been hired as the director of the film, but Fei Mu said that he was unwilling to join the China United Stone Factory to work. Therefore, once "Empress Dowager Cixi" starts filming, if a new location is not found, the director cannot be easily changed. It is generally believed that this is a loss for Ying Yin's future.</p>
<h3>Li Qinian's Activities</h3>
<p>Li Qinian has been in Shanghai for many days. Because she needs to rest after the tonsillectomy, she is temporarily staying at the Jinmen Hotel and has not yet gone to the studio to work. According to her, she has only seen "The Old House of Suspicion" at the Grand Theater since arriving in Shanghai. She plans to see "Gone with the Wind" next week. Although this film was continuously shown in Singapore for a month, it had just finished showing when she arrived there from Hong Kong to perform in a charity performance, so she never saw it. She has also scheduled to go to the Xuangong Theater next Tuesday night to see the stage play "Li Xiangjun." It is said that Yihua Company has reserved a row of seats that night to watch Tang Ruoqing's play. Qinian and Ruoqing are still good friends.</p>
<p>Hawthorn Case</p>
<h3>The Dancer's Ending</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Four: Several Guesses</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou suddenly interjected as if he had thought of something, "But after the case, the window and curtains were open."</p>
<p>"Yes, maybe she opened it after the guests left, or even if the guests didn't leave, she knew that Lao Mao was asleep and there was no danger, so she pushed the window open. Because she had been in this room for a while, and I guess the nature of their conversation must have been very brain-intensive, so it would be natural for her to open the window to let in some air. I also know that this guest stayed in this room for a considerable amount of time, so the footprints he left when he went out are very minimal."</p>
<p>I also interjected, "Yes, the footprints of this person are what we identified as 'B'. There are also two clear rows that we identified as 'A'. Judging from the level of the prints, the time that the 'B' prints entered was indeed before the 'A' prints. Although these 'B' prints overlapped with the 'A' prints when entering, I found a few complete ones, but I only found one complete 'B' print when going out, and it was very faint."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou nodded and said, "Yes, but the entry and exit of the 'A' prints are very clear. Are you saying that after the person with the 'B' prints left, a second person with 'A' prints came in?"</p>
<p>Hawthorn suddenly frowned and replied, "Yes, but there is a prerequisite problem here. Was this 'A' print guest also someone the deceased had an appointment with? Or was his arrival unexpected? And one more thing, since the person with the 'B' prints stayed in this room for a long time, and Wang Yaolan seemed to be very flattering to him, then why didn't she see him out when he left? Furthermore, even if she didn't see him off and it was inconvenient to disturb Lao Mao, she should have gone out to lock the door herself. But her shoe prints clearly tell us that she never walked out again after entering this room last night. Why? Is it because she was really waiting for a second 'A' print guest after letting the 'B' print guest leave, so there was no need to rush out to lock the door? Or did the 'A' print guest happen to come in just as the 'B' print guest was leaving, so she no longer needed to go out?"</p>
<p>I interjected, "Maybe the 'B' print guest was the murderer. She couldn't see him off because she was already dead when he left."</p>
<p>Hawthorn didn't answer, but looked at the carpet, frowning tightly, appearing to be lost in thought. Ni Jinshou also looked the same way. After a while, he also suggested, "Maybe this 'A' print guest was the murderer. He shot Wang Lilan as soon as he came in, and then took her jewelry and ran out. Mr. Hawthorn, do you think this conjecture is possible?" (58)</p>
