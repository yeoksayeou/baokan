<h3>中日問題直綫進展的機運</h3>
<p>據昨今兩日所傳蘇聯與德國在在阿簽訂文件後所取對於中日問題的態度，使問題的客觀意義，亦即問題所映射於世人心頭眼底而爲世人所體認的意義，更淸澈而明朗了。這是有益於問題的好現狀，亦是近日的新氣象，値得申說。</p>
<p>中日問題的意義原極簡明，且早已爲正直賢達而不懷成見的人們所了然。然而惡意誣蔑的，故意曲解的，別有容心而假作痴聾的，大有人在：故自七七到今天恰足四十一月雖小謂不久，似乎依然有雲翳蒙蔽了一部分：利用雲翳的更使之似乎全局紛擾混沌，以嘗試其烟慕下進攻，嘗試其渾水裏捉魚。例如說中國抗戰：不是爭取獨立生存的反侵略，而是帝國主義交相戰爭的一環：不是自覺自衛，爭取解放的民族戰爭，而是受了嗾使，徒爲若干帝國主義作前衛；不是爭取民族自由，而是第三國際世界革命政策指揮之下的犧牲者；不是專對正面的侵略，而是追隨英美兼反德義。這些謬妄的指摘，一以破壞中國抗戰，二以掩飾日本暴行，三以縱橫術數來搗亂國際。於是在形態上以歐亞兩戰的火燄漸相接近爲佐證，在觀念上故意將英德爭覇與中國抗日併爲一談，在中國以精誠團結中之國共合作指爲赤化或共黨把持，在國際以中國與歐美各國在遠東的利害共通而譏中國獨爲工具。更以這些錯綜的藉口，不辭矛盾，多方面的儘量運用，企圖所以：分化中國，拉攏蘇聯、排擠英美，中傷中德。縱所企圖，輒無效，抑中國抗戰與中日問題的本來意義，未嘗因此而或些微變質：然非絕無微效，則國際有其人焉，爲所熒惑，遂對中日問題的客觀見解爲之稍稍改觀。縱所改觀，並不能使問題的本身蒙受何種影響；然而雲翳所在，遂有種種幼稚的術數，無效的誘惑，詭計陰謀，騰挪假借，層出而不窮，使問題遭過了不必要的周折頓挫。有些徒以其自欺，終見其自誤；然而不自欺，不自誤，便得減少許多周折頓挫，詎不更善？到了現在，則漸人去蕪、削繁，芟除枝葉，披斬荆棘的佳境！蓋不但美國每一行動的饒有意義，備見强健，且於最近一萬萬美金決定貸華之後，國務卿赫爾氏明白宣稱對華借欵協定的重要性，并以爲在目前情形下，這是美國所能爲的「最小限度」之事；德國海通社電稱，這是美國新政策的第一項」措施；華盛頓外交界則謂中國能「先」向美國購輕轟炸機五十架；所謂最小限度，所謂第一項，所謂先，無不明白啓示了往後更大更多的力援。而美國再三貸款的性質，從商業的嬗遞而爲政治的，軍事的之外，如紐的通報且直言「美國現有普遍感想，以爲任何可能的對華援助，應爲美國國防程序本身的一部份』，這是美國國策不容中日問題持續其混沌的明證。英國必與美國並行，爲人人所耳熟能詳。然最足使中日問題的意義淸徹明朗的，允莫如所傳蘇德態度。關於蘇聯的，日方抹煞了日軍留駐華北與蒙疆的用意而向蘇聯聲明反共並非針對蘇聯；乃蘇聯駐日大使則代表了蘇聯政府·於答復之外，更進一步的聲明蘇聯對華政策的不變，亦即繼續援華。關於德國的，德國雖因整個國際的縱橫關係，與日本簽訂盟的，日本却以此而在遠東招搖；乃德國不因同盟關係而盲從所盟的日本，今已表示無意承認南京政權，而仍與重慶國府蟬聯原有的外交關係；可知德國心目中的軸心，絕非像日本一樣的用爲謀害中國的槓杆。由國際多方面的湊合，完成了掃除雲翳的工作；使中日問題不但在意義上顯示其淸澈明朗，亦足使今後的演進上惟有歸趨於簡明的一途：證明了日方既往的心勞日絀，亦警告了日方　後不必枉費心機。至以今後的演進，應在目前的現狀與氣象之中，不容紆迥，不再周折頓挫，而祇循直綫發展！</p>

<p>歐戰痛史（四）</p>
<h3>達拉第萊諾　桃色誤國的內幕</h3>
<p>我對萊諾說，「假使你奉命組閣，也要設法取得達拉第的支持。他在國內還是深得人望的呀！」</p>
<p>「那是國人還沒有明白他的爲人罷了。」</p>
<p>「或者如此，但是你也要顧到事實。你雖才能出衆，却是並無黨羽。急進黨仍効忠　拉第。你雖然隸屬右派，却因你輕視他們，毫無掩飾，右派也傾向着達拉第了。</p>
<p>他微微的一笑說道，「若蒙總統傳令組閣，自當設法使達拉第留任陸軍部長。」到了十點鐘，他便到衆議院去。果不出萊諾所料，達拉第總理就在當晚下臺了。勒白倫總統並卽召見來諾，請他組閣，他並不躊躇，立卽允諾。這一次，那位聰明絕頂的人，却竟完全漠視輿情，不識時務了。</p>
<p>萊雜組閣後出席議會，費盡九牛二虎之力，纔算掙着了一要的多數！議院不歡喜他，懊悔把達拉第推翻了。萊諾覺到敵對空氣濃厚，頓時失去平日的自信，演說時也無精打彩敷衍了事。</p>
<p>次日，我回到阿拉斯防地，覺得一班車人聽說萊諾組閣，莫不深爲駿異。他們都認此舉無異向輿論挑戰。政府和大部份國民，在戰時竟會發生這樣裂痕，確是一件不容忽視的事。自從萊諾就任總理以後，我還沒有見過他一面，因此我以祝賀爲辭，引用了法國革命家巴雷一句名言贈他：「承平之時，議會代表全國，戰時則由軍隊代表。」並添上一句說：「不要和軍隊失去聯絡。」</p>
<p>自從戰幕揭開，萊諾卽已表示反對甘茂林，說他身爲統帥，一無舉動，陸軍對他毫無信仰。這些問題的是非，也很難說，姑且弗論。一九三九年九月，甘茂林未向德國齊格飛防　猛攻，祇在薩爾區域採取謹愼的軍事行動，道是事實。他的政敵就借題發揮，說這時，德軍大部份都在波蘭作戰，正是進攻的大好機會。甘茂林却以爲在戰爭初起時，法國缺乏採取攻勢所必需的配備，更無大量飛機和重砲隊相助，假使冐眛進攻，必遭慘重損失。</p>
<p>甘茂林曾經說過，一我不願以「凡爾登戰役」開始戰爭。」他又解釋這句話道，「法國人口生產率本來很低，上决大戰巳受到重大的打擊，經不起冉像凡爾登戰役的大流血了。這决戰爭，將是一種科學的戰爭，一切都可預先料到，雙方的塲亡，必然寥寥無幾」。</p>
<p>我承認，我在當時，很以他的態度爲然。甘茂林的將才，外行人不應妄肆批評。馬爾納河一役，他在霞飛元帥慕下參贊戎機，首先見到這一條反敗爲勝的妙計。他在總參謀部曾爲同潦的表率，後來在戰塲上指揮師團，又能使人同深欽仰。</p>
<p>假使你第一次　到他，他那樣難於捉摸的個性，定會使你驚奇。他的兩撇小鬚，又短又硬，眼睛很小，嘴唇很簿，有一種神秘而不可思議的色彩。他不像福煦將軍的虎虎有生氣，也沒有霞飛將軍的懇切殷勤。他沉默寡言，平時進餐，常一需不發。可是他的爲人，護和有禮，部下僚屬，對他都有好感。我也覺得他爲人很和氣。當他第一决到央軍總司令戈特將軍的司令部，看見我穿着中尉級制服，就問道，「什麼？你到這樣年記，還是一個中尉嗎？」</p>
<p>「將軍，我自上决歐戰結東時起，做中尉直到現在了。」</p>
<p>他大笑道，「二十年來沒有升級嗎！太久了。我要把你升做上尉。」</p>
<p>第二次他來時，我依然是一個中尉。他很爲警愕。</p>
<p>他問貝蒂朋上校，「什麽？我不是已經叫你打電話到陸軍部，說莫樂先生應升做上尉嗎？」</p>
<p>那個上校答道，「總座，我已遵命辦理了，但前途頗有阻礙。照章須受兩期訓練，方有升遜資格，莫樂先生却祗受過一期訓練。」</p>
<p>甘茂林一聽，就轉向戈特將軍說道，「可見不論何事，都有困難。不過我想，一個總司令要把中尉升做上尉，總不會有怎樣的麻煩吧！」</p>
<p>我升級以後，甘茂林寫給我一封辭意懇切的短箋說道，一你到底升級了！不過你等到這時候才升職，我眞不敢恭賀你了。」他又的我在威森堡總司令部相會。那天在砲台地窖中聚餐的事，至今仍耿耿不忘。列席的，除我而外，尚有甘茂林的親信，指揮北菲駐軍的諾蓋斯將軍，和法國駐南斯拉夫大使白魯哲爾。</p>
<p>所談都係正事。諾蓋斯將軍講他所部的需要，白魯哲爾講南斯拉夫向法國訂購軍火合同，並未履行。甘茂林的回答，都很淸晰明確。他又問我開往薩爾的英軍第五十一師情形怎樣。後來談釗法國硏究院和所編字典，他對我說，「我們現在需要替參戰士兵取個外號。一九一四年時的法國兵，因爲久處塹壕，鬚髭滿面，听以稱爲「美髯兵，」但是一九四〇年的法國兵士，迄今尚沒有一個「雅號」哩。」</p>
<p>白魯哲爾問他德軍就會　攻嗎。</p>
<p>他道，「是的。一切部指示着他們卽將進攻。法國航空隊員和密探，却已見到德軍種種進攻準備，例如砲隊的集中，軍需的積儲，和平民的撒退等等。（未完）本文原作者莫樂上尉</p>

<h3>兩租界當局曁各界　應合作抑平米價　全市存米估計二百萬包　米商正當營業允宜維護　虞洽卿氏報告四月來經手購米情形</h3>
<p>本市米價自當局認爲有人操縱囤積居奇、曾經佈告對此輩不予保護、並歷經限價出售、無如米價愈限愈高、商民爲生活所迫、莫不愁眉蹙額、社會爲之不安、各方面會經平心研究、苦口勸導、圖挽危局、兩租界當局、亦屢决設法平準、惟在此新穀甫行登塲之際、外滙又極平穩、而米市近又劇變、平明社記者昨特走訪本市商界某專家、認爲此係暫時現象、並發表其觀點如决、</p>
<p>富戶爭購　造成高價</p>
<p>最近上海米價、已受洋米所支配、而洋米價格、則照滙市折合、目下時當國米登塲之際、外滙極爲平靖、洋米宜乎無漲價之理由、即西貢來源、雖在形勢緊張之下、亦並不斷絕、漲價之主要原因、實以投機家利用時局、故意放送民食不足之消息、使民衆羣趨囤積之一途、上海人口稱四百萬、假如富戶佔百分之一、而每人囤購十包、其總數卽達四十萬包、試問市上突遇巨量需要、市價安有不漲之理、某專家隨卽舉報紙某氏談話、認爲本市存米僅有數十萬包、實係錯誤、蓋無形中之爲提高米價者作宣傳品矣、本市散戶存米，據可靠估計、至少當在二白萬包以上、所謂存米數十萬包、係僅指棧存一項而言、洋米之主要來源爲越南、其到船並未中斷、越南雖爲產地、但市價亦由產銷而決定、我國自立國以來、洋米進口、從未有本期之多、亦即開越南食米出口之新紀　、如此時提倡囤米、反使越米連帶騰貴、自誤誤人、可謂不合經濟原理之至、某專家特鄭車申述、目前糧價上漲完全超出越南產價以上、而散戶不明眞相、盲從囤購食米、實爲最不智之行動、</p>
<p>集團購米　應加審愼</p>
<p>某專家續談、上海各界提倡集團購米、本意雖　可取、惟須注意者、（一）集團購米有提倡囤積之嫌、（二）集團購米應向西貢直接訂定、不應向上海採購、以避免爲當地囤戶所利用、（三）集團購米應避免與商人發生營業上之衝突、蓋米商不盡爲米蛀蟲、實際上且爲疏通食糧來源之主要人物、如果斷絕其生路、則裝運無人、反有影響來源可能、至於平衡目前米價之道、某專家認爲最好能實行食糧公賣、至在上海、則第一在說明目前米價上漲之原因、蓋食糧本不缺、而在羣趨囤積之下、則反有激成風潮之可能也、現在有人提倡購米而十萬石存儲一事、作爲後備之用、使市上長存米二十萬石、用意固屬甚佳、但數量殊不在多、蓋米之供銷、與普通商品供銷相同、主要方法、在疏通來源、而不在囤積、允望正當米商、源源訂購、使供求正常、實爲杜絕壟斷之唯一方法也、</p>
<p>外報傳有　黑市交易</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、上海現有越南米運到、且傳已向仰光方面、大量採辦、洋米售價乃稍回跌、上海米荳業公會近訂定洋米最高限價後、傳黑市有照高於限價之價格交易者、工部局對此、正加調查中、惟據該局發言人稱、最高米價限定後、已使濫抬米價、非法貿利之徒束手、米商超出限價售米者、寥寥無幾、日方雖仍禁止國米運來、然此間米况、尚可滿意、</p>
<p>虞洽卿致　工部局函</p>
<p>虞洽卿氏昨建議公共租界工部局函略云、日來國米價格、每石竟達百元、洋米每石八十元、且大有續漲之勢、揆厥原因、爲市塲謠傳、西貢封禁不能出口、存在虹口棧米不能運入租界中區等傳說、杯蛇影造成居奇抬價之機會、言之實堪痛心，然究其實在、西貢來竄、對於十一月廿六日以前定貨、繼續可裝運出口、所禁運者爲一號老米、且自本月廿五日以後、新米仍可續定、實不足以影響大局、但運輸方面，稍感困難、蓋英挪國籍之船、奉命不能駛往安南、船位因歐戰關係、漸覺减尠、運費不免高漲、每噸美金由六元增至十元、一時尚無船可覓、</p>
<p>所定洋米　地價分售</p>
<p>叉因時局關係、兵險保費自每千元廿五元增至五十元、照此核算、每包貢米之使費、約須增至十元左右、鄙人見此情形、是以將本人前定海達德達兩輪之米、成本每包三百廿磅爲八十元、以每包二百廿磅七十四·五·六元之低價另星分售、計三萬六千包、如數售去、另星戶名列單奉聞、藉供參考、此爲米業中人所盡知、而外間未明情形者、頗多誤會之言、殊深觖望、鄙人素營航業、與輪商接近、能將運費部份情商核减、如前者每噸美金六兀之運費、减至美金四元五角、因此核計成本、每包八十三元之米、可减至八十元左右、再以每包七十四元至七十六元之價廉售、藉示維持市况、正虧耗之不暇、反負漁利之名、鄙人經商滬市、將六十載、在社會謬承退許、問心無愧、尚不免難釋羣疑、一般米商、將本求利者、焉肯再負此巨額之危險，</p>
<p>倡議購米　存倉備用</p>
<p>然而無人續定、存底日薄、長此以往、危機日迫、推其結果、必達不忍言之境地、貴局負當地市政之重責鄙人添列董會、心所爲危、不敢知而不言擬請會同法相界公董局、卽日召集市商會，暨銀錢兩業、與米業、及紗廠等各業團體　表、共同磋商墊款購辦西貢米二十萬包、以作基本，隨時售出若干、補購若干、川流不息、有此倉存、庶可杜絕恐慌、安定市　、豈第裨曾各業、租界市政實深利賴、再關於鄙人四月來經手購辦洋米之情形、另紙繕成報告、藉供察洽、因外間對鄙於人頗有大宗囤米之謠傳、好在洋米進口、均係上棧、究竟有無屯積、不難調查、應請貴局尅日派員，向各堆棧切實查明、宜布實在、俾明眞相、而釋羣疑、允深盼疇、此致上海公共租界工部局、</p>

<h3>滬西封鎖確已寬馳　區內發現新事態　公然張貼侮蔑英人通告　日商公共汽車兩路開駛</h3>
<p>昨日據本埠英國官方對記者稱、滬西對銷區所張貼誣蔑英總領事署武官兼對日軍聯絡員亨脫少校之標語、經英總領事喬治向日當局交涉淡、業已撕去、查此項標語、係用英文寫成、但文法錯誤、辭意不通、內容大意似爲指責亨脫少校懷有「惡意」、並謂其他如同亨脫一類之人、均不准通過封鎖綫、據亨脫少校對記者稱、渠爲英總領事署所派對日軍之聯絡員、故雖有此種不倫不類之警告、但渠仍將照常出入封鎖區、渠在封鎖區內、從未遭遇不愉快之事件、亦不知此項滑稽標語之理由何在、據日本大使館發言人稱、此項標語、不知何人所貼、是吾出日軍所貼、無法確知、</p>
<p>木牌八方　均貼通告</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、滬西日當局、今日（五日）在該處封鎖區障碍物上樹木牌八方、上貼英文通告、詆責英領署對日軍聯絡官亨特少校、通告內容、不知所云、顯無意義見者告大惑不解、通告內稱「英領署武官亨特少校發不平之言如十、經煤氣行之請、此等曲折小道、豈日憲兵所設乎、凡有如亨特少校之惡意者、嚴禁通過、憲兵西區司令部印、」</p>
<p>英總領事　將提抗議</p>
<p>據亨特少校答覆記者稱、關與張此通告事、渠正繕擬報告書、擬畢後、將呈英總領事喬治辦理、渠今晨曾赴「封銷區」各障碍物前、見此通告、卽告諸英總領事云、此外、亨特少校不願多發一言、惟聞英當局對於此事、或將提出抗議、</p>
<p>封鎖情勢　已見寬弛</p>
<p>同時封鎖區情勢、今日仍見寬弛、大西路五十四號（在日憲兵佐佐木被刺地五十四衖旁）之居民、今晨已許遷出像俱、由華籍汽車夫駕駛之卡車一輛、駛至該屋前、載運傢俱、惟隨車前往搬運之華籍苦力、則不許渦障碍物、日官方人士今晨未能言定封鎖將吾於本週秒撤除、惟稱一俟排戶搜查完畢、或將予以撤除云、又食物等必需品現已准送入封鎖區、但須受嚴密檢查、</p>
<p>入晚依舊　斷絕交通</p>

<p>日商汽車　公然載客</p>
<p>又據外人方面消息、滬西遭日軍封鎖迄昨　第五日、滬西越界築路區　於工部局之管轄　、似又遠離一步、蓋昨日愚園路及大西路發現有日商公共汽車二輛、停在該二處、此事顯已直接侵害英商中國公共汽車公司所有之專利權矣、昨日下午三時叫十五分、日商公共汽車二輛、其式樣與在虹口行駛者相同、開始在地豐路與兆豐花園之間行　、不久　、又有二輛在大西路　來行駛、同時各障礙物旁，立有通告牌、略稱、華人乘此日商公共汽車者、可避免各種限制、消息靈通方面指出、上决滬西封鎖時所設種種待久之限制、卽爲預備行駛日商公共汽車之張本，該方面復稱、日商公共汽車在越界築路區行駛之車輛、雖係無多、但其不合法責一也，換言之、卽雖有一輛、如規定路程、向乘客收費、卽足以構成破壞英商中國公共汽車公司之專利　、　英　中　公共汽車公司高級　員稱、關於此事、抗　是吾已經提出、現尚未知、</p>

<h3>天津英平美鬆</h3>
<p>天津五日（週四）電、今晨滙市開盤平定、倫敦電滙不動、仍站四便士一八七五、紐的　滙硬〇三一二五、爲六元五六二五、申滙升一元半、爲九十一元、「聯鈔」暗盤昻一元二角半、爲八十匕元七角五分、</p>
<h3>金市徘徊不定</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗市、兎起鶻落、轉呈徘徊局勢、由漲轉跌、後復回平、致五千七百元大關敲破後、重見回出、各方人心尚稱穩定、自晨開市略疲、爲五千七百二十元、小錢莊補進、曾被抬上至五千七百七十元、外匯報鬆、滙票商傾向出籠、證券幫之爭售、在　至五千六百八十元低價、及聞美滙止鬆、回入六元內、價乃後出五千七百元外、午刻匯票商翻空、連前共售三千兩以上、不意市氣堅穩、散漫買風亦不弱、下午交易轉稀、價十兩、重告五千七百三十元、但嗣以散戶等因將收盤、塞出頗多、致復低達五千七百〇五元結果銀號人證券幫三十兩、好達五千七百三十兀、與上日相較、榮辱毫無、全日上落有九十元、現金號之本牌金售價、較烚赤高十數　、收進低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五六十元、均鮮做開、</p>
<h3>首飾金亦始終不動</h3>
<p>銀樓飾金、每兩兌出價始終不動、計大同行掛五百九十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進低三十　之譜、</p>
<p>日上午交易較淸、買賣雙方勢均力敵、故市價亦均無升降、午後怡泰初有大批賣出、遽將行市壓小三四角、入後忽又全數買回、市價乃亦恢復原狀、但一般散戶疲於奔命、但買戶如鴻大·恒康·順昌·順泰等、乘低吸收、不遺餘力、市價經此番試騐後前途殊無小面、市價結果、甲乙兩種略小一角、丙戊兩種毫無上落、丁種則未有做開、戊種因抽籤漸漸接力、市價因收貨者較多、漸見堅定、成交的三百萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>類別最高　最低　收盤　比前日</p>
<p>統甲　三·〇五七二—八五　七二·九五跌〇·一〇</p>
<p>統乙　七·三〇六七·〇〇　六七·二〇又〇·一〇</p>
<p>註冊股升六鎊、價爲七十六鎊、有行無市、有利銀行股漲七先令六便士、價爲十鎊十五先令、餘無變動，</p>
<p>紗花　單紗走勢尚好　業外投機獨來拋賣</p>
<p>上日忽落之紗市、昨則復入　靜之途、且微露上升之象、此因香港幫對於三十二支單紗需求繼續良好、二十支及十支粗紗交易比較爲少、然亦有動辦之模樣、所以同業心思仍屬看好、惟一般金子幫及小銀號、因中華貸款成功、拋進步、所以對於原料日廠亦有發展之舉、故回業買賣殊爲熱鬧、米特林棉一項成交的計一二千件之譜、行情二百八十五元至八十七八元、火機花價爲二百〇二三兀、均係棧交、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市　初開槃活躍、先因　物浦來電告漲、續後又因同業之購進、及華爾街股票商之收買、結果收盤價格較之上日漲五六磅音、印度停市、預測較之上日漲一羅比餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來已稍間活躍、廠方已漸動辦日方廠商亦然、但限於現貨交易、尚業間亦頗有購意、然交易</p>
<p>昨糖市以外滙　鬆、趨勢仍弱、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白初疲後緊、無甚上落、本棧貨七十三元、至七十三元半、外棧七十二兀半至七十三元、荷赤現貨五十六元二角、小一角、本月十日打棧單五十六元四角、小三角、二十日打棧單九十匕元、太古車白B嘜降元許、爲七十四元、DY嘜東棧六十九元小半元、HX嘜四棧仍六十九元、國　刁靑還價略小、未有成交、</p>
<p>煤炭　大量吸收　烟煤不漲自高</p>
<p>呈堅穩、黃豆則見貶落三五角、計做開天津金元三百包、崇明沙黃一百餘包、嘉定白蠶一百五十包、南翔靑蠶三十包、崇明沙蠶五十包皆係本街零戶去路</p>
<p>昨日有生仁二千二百包、由威海衛來滬、五日出口、有豆子五百六十包、豆餅一千二百四十塊、芝蔴一百五十包、均運杏港、六日運香港、父有豆子三百十包、豆餅四千六百六十塊、芝蔴三百五十包、蔴油五百聽、</p>
<p>藥材　砂仁到存俱薄</p>
<p>砂仁近以到貨稀少、市存且薄、故市價一再上展、如安南產之揀西砂、前後漲起六七十碼之多、現市須售三百八十元、</p>

<p>一·關於敎育科組織及行政者</p>
<p>（一）縣敎育行政機構是否健全、關係於敎育行政上之效率甚大、倘縣敎育科服務人員不得其人、或人數不足以應付事業、或工作分配不甚妥適、進行時均足發生重大之陣礙、現就各縣敎育科內部人數言、（一）人員過少、不能應付事業、爲各縣普遍之現象、有十人以上者、僅鄞縣瑞安兩縣、九人以下七人以上者、僅奉化衢縣永嘉慈豁東陽永康江山平陽鎭海九縣、餘加新昌黃岩湯溪龍游建德淳安玉環靑田龍泉宣平等十縣及嵊縣寗海溫嶺天台仙居武義浦江開化遂昌遂安樂淸縉雲松陽雲和景寗等十五縣、均僅有五人或四人、至如象山磐安泰順慶元等縣、則僅有三人而已、最少者爲定海、僅有二人、（以上係根據已送報告之四十三縣統計、其中金華麗水兩縣無確數、不計在內、）根據各縣報告、敎育科多感人手不敷、且各縣尚有列名敎育科人員而其平時工作主體又非屬於敎育部門者、今後應注意、（一）人數之多寡、應視其事業發展之需要及其所屬機關之多寡爲標準，（二）人員應專任、（三）內部工作須有適當之分配、</p>
<p>（二）就視導言、各縣因視導人員過少或督導不周　主管科對於各所屬學校情形極爲隔膜、各縣每學期應有一决或二决之巡視、俾各敎育機關服務人員均能奮勉從公、過去因視導不週、以均有學校停閉已久、而縣政府尚不知情、經費仍照常發放情事、查視導報告、本年度除游擊區所屬各縣外、尚有慈谿定海象山餘姚上虞紹興蕭山口縣新昌　然黃巖寗海溫嶺天台仙居金華蘭溪東陽義烏永康武□浦江湯溪衢縣龍游江山常山開化遂昌淳安壽昌永嘉樂睛平陽泰順縉雲松陽龍泉慶元宜□景寗等四十二縣未送、視導人員考核表、亦有三十八縣未曾送廳、各縣之實祭情形、因是亦難明瞭、今後實施國民敎育、視導工作必須嚴格辦理、希望各位注意、（一）視導人員之設置、應以所屬機關數爲正比例、（二）規定每學期巡視决數、（三）視導報告、應於學期終了後一個月內呈送、（四）視導人員考核須嚴正、</p>
<h3>獎勵本市　中小學教職員</h3>
<p>服務十年以上者彙呈請獎　子女肄業中小學申請免費</p>
<p>（大華社）本市敎育關係方面、鑒於中小學校敎職員勞苦功高、生活淸苦、關懷彌切、而自上海淪陷以後、作艱苦之奮鬥、卒能延續敎育命脈於不替、厥功尤偉、至堪欽敬、茲爲慰勞是項久任敎職員、並减輕其子女敎育費之負祖起見、除擬彙呈敎育部請予褒獎外、並參照部頒辦法、擬訂中小學敎職員子女免費肄業之辦法、凡現任公立及私立已立案中小學校敎職昌連續在一校服務滿十年以上者、均可由校長詳開履歷、彙呈請獎、經關係方面審查合格後、卽轉呈敎育部核辦、至中小學敎師之子女如在本市各公立中小學肄業者、亦可由校長彙呈請予免費經審查合格後、卽可照辦云、</p>
<h3>桂省府恢復　中學生貸金</h3>

<h3>徐府的喜事</h3>
<p>— 吃客</p>
<p>好久沒有吃喜酒啦，一則是爲了沒有人請，再則是日子難過，平時點點頭的朋友，如果有了喜事能够躱總相想躱躱一頓債不如賴人情，只裝不知道也就算了。這回老徐是挺熟悉的老鄰居，又加親自來請，看起來是非送禮非要參加婚禮不可了！</p>
<p>旣然送了禮就不肯做吃虧事，當天我穿了自以爲很不錯的綢袍子、新皮鞋，再把頭髮好好梳了一下，這些原只不過裝裝樣子，我的中、目的倒是吃和看，不像娘兒們要把這時的修飾當做一回天大的寧。</p>
<p>到了那邊，先是給招持員迎到裏面，道過喜，接過烟茶以後，我的事完了，我安逸地坐下來。</p>
<p>四周響着刺耳的人聲、　鼓聲，胡琴聲，眼前最觸目的就是那個以霓虹燈搭成的囍字又紅又大父亮，四壁的喜幛嵌着光彩奪目的金字，什麽「天作之合」，「才子佳人人花好月圓」，珠聯璧合」啦！這些看了眞叫人直想起「喜」字的意義，全身正像被「喜」的感覺所融化，我那婉惜已久的叫元禮券到現在也忘得乾乾凈凈，一個人到了這裹來如果再板起　副死人面孔，那簡直是太不合　令，並且於禮貌上也說不過去，所以大家不的而同地大開笑顏，不論男女老幼，只要和和氣氣總不是錯，這倒是最目由平等的。</p>
<p>堂會的表演，似乎不大引起人們的注意，只有孩子們緊緊地圍着臺邊，還有些過路閒人站着看白戲。臺上的角色也像心不在意，他們無神　扮演着，分明是在敷衍，他們正在數重接連的　頓中掙扎着，無法擺脫的牛活之壓迫，也許他們並不感到這兒　什喜　的竟味存任。</p>
<p>來賓中議論紛紛：</p>
<p>「怎麽？新娘子還不來呀？」</p>
<p>「聽說是去拍照了！」</p>
<p>「那兒是拍照，新娘還沒有打扮好呢！」</p>
<p>「這回聽說新娘　張，今年才十八歲新郞倒已經毛四十了！」</p>
<p>「嗯！女人在這時候也眞該嫁了！晚了就沒有人要。」</p>
<p>「那什麽話？女人難道非要靠出嫁才能　日子嗎？女人也是人，女人並沒有比男子差什麼，怎麼現在的女人都看輕自已？好像天生要做男人的　屬品一樣！哼，我可不那麽想！」</p>
<p>「看呀！那不是新娘來了嗎？」辯論給　突來的喚聲打斷大家連忙朝外而盯着　果然，門口　一個穿上鮮紅禮服的新娘給許多人湧着定進來，樂　起勁地陪奏着，人們馬上騷動起來，孩子們在人叢　鑽來鑽去。</p>
<p>「唉，是樓上趙家的新娘！」大家一塲空歡喜，可是這歡喜不久却眞的來了。</p>
<p>禮堂忽然又鬧哄哄起來，這回招待員首先奔來報告　同時我們分到很多紙花如紙條，堂會的均兒　納在一旁，衆人張頭四望，人羣　切成兩段，有的人站得老高，結婚進行曲　次響起，喧囂給嚴肅蓋沒。</p>
<p>新郞男儐　打頭，接着女儐相新娘踱着叫人難忍的慢步，「好　一生就這麼一决，他這麼想，她也這麽想。</p>
<p>新郞新娘　站定，有幾個人給他倆頸邊繞着彩色紙條，緊緊的繞了又繞，衆人滿臉打哈哈，年靑男女們引起更大的興奮，彼此心理起了作用，他們她們熱情地對望着，女的紅紅臉，把頭抵着，覺得不好意思起來。</p>
<p>席次，因爲想吃得舒暢些所以特地揀靠近　僩比我更年靑的傢伙隔壁坐下，我預先算好該夾那塊肉或那塊魚，我該　樣揀菜才能現得大方而又能吃到多量佳品。大家坐定，先是一聲「請」，於是衆筷　下，起初還要客氣兩聲，可是後來情形有點不對，分明是在搶，手脚慢了簡直吃不到東西。我旁　那孩子想不到倒是個狠客，人小吃起東西來比誰都　審，我看他橫吃豎吃，沒有閒息過，至此才感到後生可畏</p>
<p>槃中剩下一塊又大又肥的鷄，有一個人伸筷子剛　到鷄，另一雙筷子也同時側面進攻過來，前面那人不好意思縮回了手，後面一個也覺得有點那個，不快意地去揀別的東西，我隔壁那孩子乘時而進，把那塊鷄　進嘴去，前面那人證了他一眼，禮節原來是那麼一回事！</p>
<p>女客站着等我們先吃，我知道她們肚裏也在唱空城計，男客有人向她們打趣：</p>
<p>「阿要拿只饅頭去點　飢？」</p>
<p>「呸！我們又不是餓殺鬼投胎，不像你前世沒有吃過！女的嘴多硬，大家又是哈哈哈</p>
<p>座中又有一個給酒灌昏了的醉鬼哭嘻嘻地指　臺上正在唱申曲的女角說：</p>
<p>「×××嫁了人就走了氣？」</p>
<p>「走氣？她男人還靠着她的名　　錢哩。你看今天這牛個鐘頭又是四十只老洋！」</p>
<p>臺　有一個扮老婆婆的這回聲音　別高：</p>
<p>「啊呀？你個小姑娘，要好倌人怎小容易，看那麼多，你揀好哉！一牠把手指着來賓。大家心頭癢癢的，嘴角掛起了笑容，再聽　女的吧。</p>
<p>他們不要我的！一她紅着臉，故意向大家　瞟。</p>
<p>「我要的！我要的！…」觀衆不的　同吼聲齊起，便宜貨人人要搭，笑聲像雷樣饗　空問，關不住的性飢渴到這時一起發洩出來。</p>
<p>帶着顆又醉父喜的心踏着我的歸途，夜晚冷風凄凄，一切又重覆沉寂下來。</p>

<h3>「意料之外」和「意料之中」</h3>
<p>— 左傳</p>
<p>狐狸　讚老鴉唱歌唱得好，老鴉嘴一張，口裹啣的肉就掉人了狐狸嘴巴，這固然有點兒出於「意料之外」；可是，「樂極」以後的「生悲」，却又是「意料之中」的事了。本來，做事情不可以太「過份」：皮球壓緊了還會「彈上一彈」；把仇人通到危崖，父那裏不可能回轉身子來大戰三合？</p>
<p>當然，野心的幻想常常是甜密的。自以爲「德威　施以後，人家是「保」可以投　掌握，非但稱心，而且能够滿「意」了；豈知出於「意料之外」，「保」的東西却一旦「別抱琵琶」了！</p>
<p>噯！眞是出於「意料之外」！</p>
<p>其實什細想一想，眞正的優子還有點「儍聰明」，何况「聰叫人裝儍子」的聰明更要「拱高一着」？</p>
<p>所以統而言之，這意料之外却又早是「意料之中」的事！</p>
<p>噯！眞是意料之中」！</p>

<p>詩云：殷鑒小還，在夏后之世。」歷史本是人類　明瞭　切實的一面放大鏡子，古往今來，治亂興衰之由，盈虛消長之道，都在這個裏圓看出來。可惜一般人沉溺於環境，忽略了自身，以致演出種種覆轍重蹈的事迹，遂使　之視今，亦猶今之視昔。前朝興亡，徒存陳踏，今世演變，增感將來。杜牧所謂「後人哀之而不鑑之，亦使後人而復哀　人也。」這兩句話說得何等痛切啊！當明季天下大亂，國祚危亡之際，江南一隅，偏趁燈火樓臺，管絃曲巷，紈茵浪子，瀟洒詞人，馬龍車水，歌舞昇牛，好似國勢的阽危，外侮的急迫，有耳不聞，有目不見，厝火　薪之上，憫然自以爲安，抱着「且以喜樂，且以永日，宛其死矣，他人人室一之念，尋求眼　的快活，不顧他日的禍難。便是那些名公鉅鄉，身負着治國禦侮的職責，儼然如廟堂之具，干城之器的，也都自命風流，物色佳麗，　食之暇，河上逍遙。唉。難道這也是時會使然嗎？偏偏彼蒼　天也似知情識　的，靈秀　毓　氣往往產生於巾幗。一個個墮落風塵的，恰好都是蘭心蕙質，多情多藝的絕代佳人，世間尤物。男子本是泥做的，女子是水做的，英雄好色，王公好色，才人好色，一般的　逃　人之關，顚倒於　榴裙下。同時自然也產生出許多　童狎客，雜伎名優，獻媚爭姸，絡繹奔赴，板橋雜記所謂一垂楊影外，片玉壺中，秋笛頻吹，春鶯乍囀，雖宋廣平鐵石心腸，不能不　梅花作賦也。」然而天下人心豈是盡死？最苦痛的　算那些志士仁人，漆室女子，蒿目時艱，痛　國禍，在衆生沉醉，外患猖在的為兒，杞人之憂，旣屬無益，在瀾獨挽，父豈易見？他們沒奈何秉着一腔熱血，滿懷雄心，向艱苦困難的環境中去奮鬥，知其不可爲而猶爲之，成敗和鈍，一切小顧，這豈非驚天地而泣鬼神嗎？一壁兒這樣，一壁兒那樣，交相在多壘的四郊，板蕩的中喊演出。鐵馬金戈，翠袖紅粉，這留予後人的陳跋，使髣髴其境的　人視之，怎麼不傷今弔古，怵目驚心？眞是「花草朱門空後閣，琵琶靑塚恨明妃。」江南斷陽之句，安得解人如賀方回者，領略其味呢？　（一）</p>

<h3>關於「賽金花」</h3>
<p>— 梁號</p>
<p>地從重慶回來主演　西太后」的英茵，我們却先看到了她的賽金花」。描寫這位一萬人尊　賽　爺一的，有過曾孟樸的「孼海花」，及　衍熊佛西的二個，劇本。「孽　花」並不是忠實的叙述，早已有人論及，賽金花在北平的一條陋巷里將要結束她的一生的時候，她答覆一位訪問者，也對　孽海花」表示不　。至於兩個劇本，夏衍的是借賽金花這人物來諷刺當時的　治及外交的，抗戰以後，已不適用，所以劇藝社在「璇宮一決定公演賽金花」的時候，採取了熊佛西的劇本。熊佛西的劇本是從狀。夫人重張艷幟起，直到她的死去，寫「一代紅顏」的一生果然是忠實了，但「爺」的苟全外交」在此時此地將引起觀衆的誤會，魏如晦改編　，雖然加了一個珊兒，來吾定賽金花的「行爲」，終也是勉强得很。</p>
<p>現在合衆的本子，也是採取魏如晦改編的熊佛西本。上月魏如晦曾給本刋一封更正信，他說他根本不希望把　賽金花一攝成電影，雖然許多材料確是由他供給的。我沒有看過賽金花　電影，據設片中沒有「洋人」出　，這或許也是適合此時此地的「雙重」環境吧。不過，編者無論怎樣苦心改編，「賽金花祇是一個一代紅顏」的戲而已。反正英茵的演技是不會使人失望的。</p>

<h3>今日上海之漫畫界</h3>
<p>— 張義璋</p>
<p>上海是中國「漫畫」的發祥地；十餘年來，人才輩出。論漫畫在中國的歷史，嚴格地談起來，還祇有十五個年頭。前乎此者，偶有發見，還不是純粹的「漫畫」。</p>
<p>「民十五，中國始有漫書，上海得風氣之先；至民二十而大盛。更踰二年，海上漫畫刊物羣起，工畫之士日衆，一時「漫畫家」多如過江之鲴。」上述云云，可作部簡短的「中國漫畫史」看。</p>
<p>戰前，上海有　全國漫畫同志聯歡會」，曾幾度舉行畫展」和聚餐」。會員人數，的計叫五十衆。這數字並不是中國「漫畫人」的確數。</p>
<p>八一三事起後，「漫畫人」紛紛離開上海；其逗留不去者，大抵爲「事業」或「家庭」所覊。不過大都是　光義晦」，不大發表作品。（下走近年也不常治畫，偶有著述，也無非「興到爲之」。對于非所深知的出版物。一律謝絕作稿，此可以吿慰於關心我者。）</p>

<h3>記葉盛章的兩戲</h3>
<p>— 沙蕾</p>
<p>以武　而挑大標，在上海梨園中似乎很少「先例」，而最近富連成社由平南來，出演於黃金大戲院，破例以武丑葉盛章懸頭牌，却造成了出乎意外的優越成績，這自然也是葉盛章的一身技藝，有以致之。</p>
<p>筆者會看過葉　章的兩齣戲，一是「巧連環，二是銅網陣」。盛章在「巧連環中，飾鼓上蚤時遷，此劇一名「時遷偷鷄一，塲子簡單，因此一切跌撲翻騰的工夫，可以從容表演，從大體上說來，盛章的玩藝兒是在水準之上的，他小僅是身手矯捷，而目在矯捷之中兼見其穩練，與店家開玩笑的詼諧，能不流於庸俗，也是難得的。最後吃鷄時，更有呑火的表演，顯然這造在武術團中所習見的玩藝，但在皮簧劇中却很少見。</p>
<p>「銅網陣」，取村於「七俠五義」一書，演白玉堂獨探冲霄樓事，也就是狸貓換太子」中精彩的一節。前半部差不多是白玉堂蘇富恩飾鄧車（高盛虹飾）的戲，葉盛章於後半部纔出塲，飾翻江鼠蔣平，全劇的　心在「撈印」一塲，盛章在這時便顯出了他的所有技能，矯捷得眞像一頭耗子一樣；出水時的顫慄形容得很好，允其成功的是聽得白玉堂生死莫下之訊以後，嗚咽着說：「要是兄弟你先走了一步，做哥哥的可痛心哪！」那一種悲愴的神情，使人意識到的友愛的眞摯，眞要感動得掉下淚來；所以葉盛章不但是手脚功夫了得，同時他也很懂「阿克了」藝術；他的能够當一而而挑大樑，自然不是偶然的事了。</p>
<h3>中旅重演「原野」　主角林納小史</h3>

<p>「原野」上演的第一天，記者往觀，覺得林納小姐之精湛嫻熟的演技，是出於意外的美滿，眞可與孫景璐媲美。後在璇宮的後臺，向林納小姐作了一决簡短的訪問。</p>
<p>她那　口流俐的國語，是誰都不會　得到，她是一個蘇州人，四歲時，隨着家庭到了靑島，在那裏，她度過了初中的求學生活。戰事發生後，才避雖到了上海，淮私立上海中學繼續攻讀，以愛好話劇，不時作興趣上的演出。</p>

<h3>US HOLDS SPECIAL MEETING TO DISCUSS STEPS TO AID CHINA AND BRITAIN. IMPORTANT ECONOMIC MEASURES ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION. BRITAIN AND THE UNITED STATES MAINTAIN CLOSE CONTACT ON THE FAR EAST.</h3>
<p>London: British Foreign Secretary Butler told the House of Commons yesterday that Britain and the United States are maintaining the closest contact on all issues of common interest in the Far East, including naval and similar defense matters. However, Butler declined to disclose details of recent talks between US Secretary of State Hull and British Ambassador to the US, Lord Lothian. (International News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>Washington: On Tuesday night, key US government officials held a special meeting. Nine of the most important government personnel attended, including Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and Commerce Secretary and Federal Loan Administrator Jones, as well as Army Chief of Staff Marshall, Secretary of War Stimson, and Secretary of the Navy Knox. It is widely believed that the discussions focused on Britain's finances and new steps for US aid to Britain. Jones told reporters yesterday that he considers it appropriate to invest in Britain for legitimate purposes. When asked if the Johnson Act, which prohibits loans to countries that have defaulted on war debts, should be repealed, Jones replied that it was not yet the time. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau announced yesterday that British Treasury Secretary Phillips will come here to meet with US Treasury officials and present the latest available information. It is believed that Phillips's arrival will help clarify the situation. Special meetings of key government officials have been held three times before, and each meeting has been followed by significant moves to aid Britain. The first meeting was followed by the exchange of destroyers for bases, the second by the facilitation of increased aircraft purchases by Britain up to 12,000, and the third by the supply of Flying Fortresses to Britain. Therefore, the result of this meeting is certain to be financial assistance from the United States to Britain. However, Jones announced shortly after the meeting adjourned on Tuesday night that he does not advocate lending to Britain now or in the near future to finance its war effort. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Washington: US economic aid to China and Britain was the focus of attention in Washington diplomatic and financial circles yesterday. The United States is currently considering the possibility of providing economic assistance to Britain in some form. Federal Loan Administrator Jones said that Britain is "taking a worthwhile gamble." Jones declined to specify how and when such aid would occur, but he reiterated his opposition to repealing the Johnson Act. His policy is to use government funds for "worthwhile ventures when they are needed for legitimate purposes." Britain says they need financial resources. "It was very clear that important economic measures were being considered when four cabinet members, including Jones, held a meeting in Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's office on Tuesday. Strengthening China's finances to economic assistance is one of the most important international financial issues for Treasury officials at present. Morgenthau said after attending a joint congressional committee on Monday that once this aid is launched, it will proceed as quickly as possible. Jones said yesterday that China has already repaid $5 million of the $12 million it previously borrowed in the United States. Most of this repayment was in the form of tung oil imports. He pointed out that several hundred thousand dollars were for tin transport and said, "China should speed up mining."

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE SINO-JAPANESE PROBLEM TO PROGRESS IN A STRAIGHT LINE</h3>
<p>Based on the attitudes towards the Sino-Japanese problem taken by the Soviet Union and Germany after the signing of documents in Moscow, as reported yesterday and today, the objective significance of the problem, that is, the significance of the problem as it is reflected in the hearts and minds of the world and recognized by the world, has become clearer and more distinct. This is beneficial to the good current state of the problem and is a new atmosphere in recent days, worthy of further discussion.</p>
<p>The significance of the Sino-Japanese problem was originally very simple and had long been understood by honest, virtuous, and unbiased people. However, there are many who maliciously slander, deliberately distort, or pretend to be deaf and dumb for ulterior motives. Therefore, from the July 7th Incident to today, exactly forty-one months, though not long, it seems that there is still cloudiness obscuring a part of the view. Those who take advantage of the cloudiness make it seem as if the whole situation is chaotic and confusing, to attempt to attack under the cover of smoke and try to fish in troubled waters. For example, it is said that China's resistance is not an anti-aggression to strive for independent survival, but a link in the mutual war of imperialism; not a conscious self-defense and national war for liberation, but instigated and merely acting as the vanguard for some imperialists; not striving for national freedom, but a sacrifice under the command of the Third International's world revolution policy; not exclusively against frontal aggression, but following Britain and the United States while opposing Germany and Italy. These absurd accusations are intended to undermine China's resistance, conceal Japan's atrocities, and disrupt international relations through strategic machinations. Thus, the flames of the European and Asian wars are gradually approaching each other in form, and in concept, the struggle between Britain and Germany is deliberately equated with China's war of resistance against Japan. In China, the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party within the unity of spirit is referred to as being red or controlled by the Communist Party. Internationally, China is criticized for being a tool because of the common interests of China and various European and American countries in the Far East. Moreover, these complicated excuses are used in multiple ways, regardless of contradictions, in an attempt to: divide China, win over the Soviet Union, exclude Britain and the United States, and slander China and Germany. Even though the attempts are often ineffective, and the original meaning of China's resistance and the Sino-Japanese problem has not changed in the slightest as a result, it is not entirely without a slight effect. Consequently some people in the international community have been misled and slightly changed their objective understanding of the Sino-Japanese problem. Even though the change in view cannot have any impact on the problem itself, the presence of cloudiness has led to all kinds of naive tactics, ineffective temptations, schemes and conspiracies, transfers and borrowings, emerging endlessly, causing the problem to undergo unnecessary twists and turns. Some are just deceiving themselves, and will eventually see their own mistakes. However, if one does not deceive oneself or make mistakes, one can reduce many twists and turns. Wouldn't that be better? Now, we are gradually entering a better state of removing the dross, cutting out the unnecessary, and clearing away the thorns! It is not only that every action of the United States is meaningful and full of strength, but also that after the recent decision to lend 100 million US dollars to China, Secretary of State Hull clearly declared the importance of the loan agreement with China, and considered that under the current circumstances, this is the "minimum" that the United States can do. The German News Agency reported that this is the "first" measure of the new US policy, and diplomatic circles in Washington said that China can "first" purchase 50 light bombers from the United States. The so-called minimum, the so-called first, and the so-called first all clearly reveal greater and more assistance in the future. The nature of the US repeatedly making loans, from commercial to political and military, is changing, and as the New York News Agency bluntly stated, "There is a general feeling in the United States that any possible aid to China should be part of the US national defense program itself." This is clear evidence that US policy will not allow the Sino-Japanese problem to continue its chaos. It is well known that Britain will act in concert with the United States. However, what is most likely to make the significance of the Sino-Japanese problem clear and distinct is undoubtedly the reported attitude of the Soviet Union and Germany. Regarding the Soviet Union, the Japanese side denied the intention of stationing Japanese troops in North China and Inner Mongolia and declared to the Soviet Union that anti-communism was not aimed at the Soviet Union. However, the Soviet Ambassador to Japan, representing the Soviet government, not only replied but further stated that the Soviet Union's policy towards China remains unchanged, that is, continuing to aid China. Regarding Germany, although Germany signed an alliance with Japan due to the overall international relationship, Japan used this to swagger in the Far East. However, Germany did not blindly follow its ally Japan because of the alliance relationship. It has now indicated that it has no intention of recognizing the Nanjing regime and maintains its original diplomatic relations with the Chongqing National Government. It can be seen that the axis in Germany's mind is by no means used as a lever to harm China like Japan. The combination of multiple parties in the international community has completed the work of clearing away the cloudiness, making the Sino-Japanese problem not only clear and distinct in significance but also making its future evolution only tend towards a simple path. It proves that Japan's past efforts have been diminishing day by day and warns Japan not to waste its efforts in the future. As for the future evolution, it should be in the current state and atmosphere, not allowing for detours, no more twists and turns, but only developing in a straight line!</p>
<h3>FIERCE FIGHTING IN SOUTHEASTERN PENGZE - JAPANESE TROOPS INVADE CHINA IN FOUR ROUTES - CHINESE TROOPS COUNTER-ATTACK AND RECAPTURE TWO STRONGHOLDS</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to news received here, there is currently fierce fighting near Pengze, downstream of Jiujiang. It is reported that Japanese troops attacked Chinese positions on the south bank of the Yangtze River. It is said that Chinese troops had threatened Japanese ships traveling between Shanghai and Hankou. After Japanese reinforcements arrived in Jiujiang on seven warships, the Japanese troops in Pengze, under the cover of aircraft, artillery, and warships, launched a four-pronged attack on Chinese troops southeast of Pengze near the Anhui-Jiangsu border. (Reuters, 5th)</p>

<h3>Vietnam Denies French Planes Bombed Thailand; France Hopes for Peaceful Resolution to Vietnam-Thailand Dispute; Thai Newspaper Demands Government Take Strong Action</h3>
<p>Hanoi: The Vietnamese government has announced that all indigenous leaders of the Cochin China uprising have been arrested. The government denies reports from Bangkok that French planes bombed Thai cities. It also claims that Thai machine gun fire reached the French guardhouse in Poipet (transliteration) yesterday. While the machine gun fire occurred, three Thai planes circled over Poipet. Herman, a Dutch reporter for a Dutch East Indies newspaper, was allegedly killed by a man believed to be a Thai native who rushed into the guardhouse; the perpetrator immediately escaped into the darkness. There have been no recent reports of incidents or hostilities along the border, and war activities have ceased. However, internal communications are difficult, making it difficult to obtain immediate news from the nearly 2,000-mile border. Despite the tense situation, officials express optimism about the ongoing negotiations in Bangkok by the French Minister to Thailand, Garreau. The progress of the negotiations is unknown due to obstructed communication between Hanoi and Bangkok. Yesterday, the government announced that multiple indigenous uprisings had occurred in the three western provinces of Cochin China, while uprisings in eastern Cochin China had decreased due to suppression. In the northern border of Cochin China, twenty indigenous military officers were killed, nine went missing, and twenty-one were injured during suppression by authorities. There are also disturbances in northern Indochina. In Tokyo and Annam, forty-eight alleged communists have been arrested. Suppression is currently underway in northern Tokyo to deal with indigenous bandits who looted Lang Son and organized uprisings. (United Press, 5th)</p>
<p>Bangkok: Military authorities here recently stated that if the situation worsens, Thai troops could occupy Luang Prabang (transliteration) and Pakse (transliteration) in Vietnam within 24 hours. Even if there is any French resistance along the Mekong River, Thailand can enter Vietnamese territory without significant effort. The French have not built defenses on the right bank of the Mekong River, and Thailand's demands do not extend beyond the Mekong. When demanding the return of Luang Prabang (transliteration) and Pakse (transliteration), the Thai government stated that if France lost sovereignty over Laos and Eastern Cambodia, these previously Thai territories should be returned to Thailand. These territories were taken from Thailand by France in 1893, as they would only allow France to occupy a narrow strip of the Vietnamese coast. It is reported that a large number of Thai troops in the east have concentrated in Udon (transliteration), opposite Vientiane (transliteration), and in the west, they have concentrated in Ubon (transliteration), opposite Pakse (transliteration), with troops increasing daily. In addition, five hundred planes have been sent to Ubon, and the government recently announced that it had dispatched fifty-eight planes to patrol the border. The government's announcement stated that sending planes to the border was necessary because French planes frequently violate Thai territory. Military authorities here, considering the ongoing indigenous unrest in Vietnam, increasingly believe that if an invasion of Vietnam becomes necessary, the anti-French unrest within Vietnam may aid Thailand's success. According to official border news, numerous Annamese troops have betrayed the French army and pledged allegiance to the Thai army. Thai military circles predict that in the event of war, indigenous troops within the French army will defect from the French and side with Thailand. In a recent speech, Thai Prime Minister Songgram expressed hope that the Annamese would assist Thailand, stating that Annam could become an independent country again once the Far East situation reaches a final resolution. Newspapers here continue to criticize France and demand that the government take military action if France refuses to return Luang Prabang and Pakse to Thailand. (United Press, 5th)</p>
<p>Bangkok: Thai newspapers recently demanded that the government take "strong action to counter France's repeated barbaric acts of aggression." These newspaper opinions were published after the Thai Supreme Command announced an incident on the border. The Supreme Command stated that French Moroccan troops shelled Thai troops in Ban Don, a place on the Mekong River, yesterday. Thai troops did not return fire due to the long distance. (United Press, 5th)</p>
<p>Vichy: Officials announced that there has been no continuing tension on the Thai-Vietnamese border recently. The French Minister to Thailand, Garreau, is currently negotiating with Thai officials. The French government has high hopes for a peaceful resolution to the Thai-Vietnamese issue, believing it will not sacrifice Vietnamese territory. (United Press, 5th)</p>

<p>Hanoi: From November 23rd to December 3rd, Vietnamese military and police authorities conducted a communist purge in Cochin China. Many of the party's troublemakers were hiding in rural areas. After a thorough search by the military and police, four were killed and many arrested. Several indigenous leaders and police officers who were kidnapped by the communists and taken to the countryside have now been rescued. In addition, a group of rioters in Giang Thanh Province (transliteration) attempted to set fire to several residences of indigenous leaders and a post office branch, and military and police authorities are arresting them. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Hanoi: Dutch journalist Herman was attempting to enter Thailand from Ha Tien town on the Vietnamese-Cambodian border last night when he was mistakenly identified as a customs official from Ha Tien by the Thai side, who opened fire, shooting him in the chest. He was immediately transported to Battambang for treatment but died in the ambulance due to the severity of his injuries. Several hours later, the residence of the customs official was strafed by Thai soldiers with machine guns. This morning, three Thai planes flew over the town again. (Havas, 4th)</p>

<h3>Free China Increases Steel Production</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently released a public announcement stating that steel production in the Free Area this year has increased by 30% compared to last year.

It can be confidently asserted that as rear area industries flourish, this steel production will be insufficient for distribution. However, it is expected that by the end of this year, there will be enough steel to meet the urgent needs of the military and industry. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Today, a spokesman for the Ministry of Economic Affairs, referring to the meeting of Chinese steel experts in Chongqing on Tuesday, stated that by the end of 1941, China will have sufficient steel to meet most of its military and industrial needs.

<h3>Greek Army Launches New Offensive on Albanian Central Front; Tirana Faces Severe Threat; Greek Army Cuts Off Italian Army's Retreat; Rumor of Establishment of Albanian Republic in Korçë</h3>
<p>Sofia: Athens Radio reported yesterday that the Greek army is making continuous progress. Italian troops have abandoned their new defense line north of Pogradec and are retreating towards Elbasan, 24 miles from Tirana. On the central front, the Greek army launched an effective new offensive against the Italian army, which is fiercely resisting.

Since occupying Pogradec, the Greek army has placed significant pressure on the Italian army. Greek air force planes are continuously bombing the retreating Italian troops. (United Press, 5th)</p>
<p>Yugoslav Border: The advance guard of the Greek army in Albania, which was captured far from its base, is now experiencing some difficulties with supplies. The area near the Yugoslav border was very peaceful yesterday. The terrain in this area is very difficult, and the roads are blocked by snow, making passage almost impossible. Yesterday morning, two Italian soldiers and three Albanian soldiers surrendered to the Yugoslav authorities at the border. According to the Italian soldiers, the morale of the Italian army is declining daily. According to the Albanian soldiers, the Italian army in Albania is now arbitrarily abusing civilians.

<p>Struga, Yugoslavia: Since the heavy snowfall on Tuesday night, all mountain roads in the war zone have been buried in snow, hindering military operations. The heavy snowfall has not stopped throughout the region. In the Kefasan district, the Greek army is advancing along the northbound highway towards Elbasan and has occupied two small villages along the way. The Greek army in the Argyrokastro district crossed the Drin River near Vanishta and has occupied the village of Libohovë. The Italian army is retreating towards the village of Sofratikë. In the Opari region, the Italian army is resisting fiercely. Near the village of Mallakastra, they repelled the Greek army, which had advanced nine kilometers on Tuesday. The Greek army suffered 100 soldiers and 3 officers killed. The Italian army also suffered heavy casualties. In the Konispol region, the Greek army is advancing towards Bënjës and has advanced eight kilometers, now only eight kilometers from the village. (United Press, 5th)</p>
<p>Sant' Agata d' Esaro: Yesterday, Greek troops, through bombing and artillery fire, drove the Italian army out of their strongholds in Porto Edda and Argyrokastro. Under heavy Greek attacks, the Italian army rapidly retreated, and the escape route along the highway north to Delvinë and Argyrokastro has been cut off by the Greek army. Italian troops were forced to flee along coastal routes, suffering heavy losses. Greek forces claim they have captured countless military supplies. A reporter stood beside Greek artillerymen with bloodshot eyes, who seemed to have not slept for days but remained tireless, manning their artillery positions and continuously shelling the enemy, frequently requesting more shells. Recently, Italian planes flew over us, searching for artillery positions. They dropped 150 bombs and were quickly chased away by Greek reconnaissance planes. (United Press, 5th)</p>
<p>Athens: This morning, reports indicate that the Italian army is in full retreat from Porto Edda, Argyrokastro, and Premeti, key strongholds in southern Albania. The Greek army is poised to occupy the above three cities within days. The Greek army in the north, advancing in two routes, threatens Tirana and Elbasan. It is reported to have reached the Shkumbin River. After a fierce battle in a day-long blizzard, the severe threat to Tirana is even more apparent. The Greek army seems to have destroyed the Italian army's desperate resistance and breached a section of the Italian front line west of Pogradec. It is rumored that the Greek army annihilated two of the Italian army's elite regiments before breaking through the breach. Furthermore, several bridgehead fortifications have been built near the upstream of the Shkumbin River, along the highway that runs parallel to Elbasan, forty miles west. It is understood that the Greek army in the southern coastal area surrounded Porto Edda and, after a day-long fierce battle, is only hundreds of yards from the seaport. It is widely expected that the fall of the city is imminent. (International News, 5th)</p>
<p>Athens: According to reliable sources from Zurich, Switzerland, Greek patrols entered the outskirts of Sarandë last night, a major military town in southern Albania. (United Press, 5th)</p>
<p>Athens: It was confirmed here yesterday that, as of December 2nd, the Greek army had captured 7,000 Italian soldiers. It was also learned from authoritative sources that the Greek army has captured no fewer than a thousand Italian soldiers in recent days. It was also learned that when the Greek army occupied Pogradec, the number of Italian soldiers captured was small because the Italians began withdrawing from the city last week. (United Press, 5th)</p>
<p>Southern Capital: According to news from the front lines received by Southern newspapers, after Pogradec was occupied by the Greek army on the 3rd, several positions northwest of the city were recaptured by the Italian army yesterday morning but were subsequently reoccupied by the Greek army in a counterattack. The northern position of the Greek army, starting from Tepe Lena in the west, extends to the source of the Shkumbin River, and from Mount Gamilas to the Devol River, connecting with Argyrokastro in the northwest. Yesterday, the Italian army's artillery shelled Greek positions throughout the day. (Haitong, 5th)</p>

<p>Greek Army Achieves New Victory, Occupies Bonah Forest</p>
<p>London: Suppressed news from Athens states that the Greek army reached the city of Santi Quaranta (a base for Italian aggression in southern Albania) yesterday. Italian troops are continuously retreating in various areas of the front, and the Greek army is gradually advancing, seemingly poised to drive all Italian troops out of the Balkans. The Italian side is trying to contain the situation but seems to be failing everywhere. London received unconfirmed news yesterday stating that, in order to extricate itself from the difficulties it faces, the Italian government has ordered the mobilization of thousands of able-bodied men. Meanwhile, it is reported that the Greek army has achieved new victories near Argyrokastro and north of the Yugoslav border. The so-called "daredevil battalion" of the Italian Folgore Division was defeated after a fierce battle overnight, and the Greek army occupied the Bonah Forest. This battle is of great significance, as it greatly facilitates the Greek army's advance towards Argyrokastro (the only remaining major base of the Italian vanguard in Albania). The Greek army in other areas, despite encountering stubborn resistance from the Italian army, also achieved similar victories. The Greek army on the northern route has also occupied several heights north of Mount Ostrovicë, driving back Italian units holding deep trenches and strong fortifications. The Italian army then attempted to counterattack near Lake Ohrid but was repelled, with many captured. It is believed that this battle will also have a significant impact on future wars. According to captured Italian soldiers, Italian officials in Albania have indeed implemented terror tactics to secure defenses, and there have been instances of executions after every decisive defeat. The results of the Greek army's operations in the past 36 hours have created several pocket-shaped positions, with their front lines extending deep into southern Albania, forming a large egg shape. Yesterday, the Greek army continued to press the Italian army north of Santi Quaranta and Argyrokastro, which retreated from Premeti towards Këlcyrë and Tepelenë, harassed by planes along the way. The Greek army, which was very close to Premeti in the morning, continued to advance. The Italian army's resistance in the area around Moscopole, southwest of Pogradec, where fierce fighting had been taking place for several days, has also weakened. North of Pogradec, the Greek army has occupied villages on the shores of Lake Ohrid. However, responsible Greek newspapers warn the public not to be overly optimistic, stating that even larger battles lie ahead. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Budapest: Greek radio reported that British and Greek aircraft bombed Tirana, the capital of Albania, yesterday. British and Greek aircraft also shot down seventeen Italian planes in the northern front amidst heavy Italian anti-aircraft fire and attacked Italian troops retreating in disarray towards Elbasan in central Albania. The radio continued that, despite adverse weather conditions and Italian resistance, the Greek army has taken control of the entire front line. On the southern front, the Italian army has been forced to abandon several important military points to avoid capture. The Greek army also defeated two battalions of the Italian Besaglieri Division in the Konispol salient in the Argyrokastro area, capturing countless artillery pieces and military equipment. According to news from Athens via Zurich, Greek troops entered Sarandë, a major city in southern Albania, last night. Furthermore, according to a public announcement from the Ministry of Public Security, Italian planes bombed Përmet on Wednesday, causing minor deaths and injuries among non-combatants and slight damage to houses. Also, news from Sofia stated that after the Greek army's advance, the Italian army abandoned its new position north of Pogradec and retreated towards Elbasan, and that the Greek army had made progress on all fronts. According to news from Belgrade, Greek troops captured more than 3,500 Italian soldiers on the roads along the west bank of Lake Ohrid. The Athens government announced that the Greek army captured more than 400 Italian soldiers when occupying the plateau north of Pogradec. It also stated that as a result of fierce fighting in the mountains west of Pogradec, the Greek army occupied Premeti and captured more than 500 Italian soldiers. (United Press, 5th)</p>
<p>Greek Army Captures Mountains, Italian Army Retreats West</p>
<p>Athens: Last night's Greek communique stated that the Greek army had occupied Premeti, causing heavy losses to the Italian army. The Greek army captured more than 500 Italian soldiers, six artillery pieces, and countless military supplies. According to a Greek spokesman in Athens, the Italian army has abandoned new positions on several aspects of the Albanian front, apparently to avoid the Greek army's major encirclement operation. The most important Faleri range, northeast and directly north of Premeti, has fallen into the hands of the Greek army. The Italian army is now retreating west. The Italian army, guarding the heights northwest of Pogradec, collapsed and retreated west after the Greek army charged with bayonets. The Greek army continues to advance in other areas. All Italian counterattacks have been repelled. Attempts by the Italian army to reorganize its front lines by increasing reinforcements have apparently failed. Maintaining joint operations between the various armies is becoming increasingly difficult. Greek planes are now bombing moving Italian vehicles over the entire line, and British planes have also joined in the cooperation. According to the Greek side, the Italian radio's claim that the Greek army will collapse once it operates on the plains is not necessarily true. The Greek army is not afraid of fighting the Italian army on the Albanian plains because the Greek army already has similar mechanized units to deal with the Italian army's motorized units. Moreover, the entire territory of Albania has high mountains, and the Greek army's strategy is to first capture the high ground and then control the plains. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting on the Greek Front, Italian Planes Active</p>
<p>Rome: According to the Italian military headquarters, fierce fighting occurred on the Greek front yesterday. Italian planes assisted the army in operations, bombing military targets, roads, bridges, freight vehicles, and marching troops. The highway from Premeti to Berat was bombed and severed in several places. The islands of Corfu, Zante, and Preveza were also bombed by Italian planes. Italian planes fought fiercely with enemy planes, shooting down five enemy planes. Two Italian planes did not return. The Italian submarine "Telfino" sank a Greek destroyer in the Aegean Sea on November 29th. On the East African front, an attack by enemy mechanized units on Italian positions west of Tesenei has been repelled. Enemy planes attacked Scilla and Crotone, causing no damage or casualties. Italian fighters shot down an enemy plane. Enemy planes flying from Switzerland attacked Turin, killing one person and injuring three. A dye factory, a paper mill, and a textile factory were set on fire by the bombing but were quickly extinguished. No military targets were damaged. (Haitong, 5th)</p>

<h3>Economic Cooperation Agreement Signed Between Germany and Romania; Ten-Year Economic Construction Plan Implemented</h3>
<p>Berlin According to the official gazette released here last night, Germany and Romania have now agreed to closer economic cooperation. After weeks of negotiations, a new agreement was signed in Berlin on the 3rd of this month, allowing Germany and Romania to cooperate and assist Romania in a ten-year economic construction plan. The representatives who signed the new agreement were Mr. Clodius, Director of the Economic Department of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Mr. Galatianu, the Romanian Minister to Germany, and Mr. Dimitrie, head of the Romanian economic delegation. When the Romanian State Leader Antonescu and Minister of Economy Cancicov visited Berlin, they personally participated in the negotiations to discuss important issues. One of the most important parts of the agreement is the protocol on German-Romanian cooperation in the implementation of the ten-year plan, which was officially announced by the government last night. (5th, Huitong News Agency)</p>
<p>Berlin The protocol signed between Germany and Romania for the implementation of Romania's ten-year economic construction plan stipulates that Romania can seek assistance and cooperation from the German government when implementing this huge plan. The German government has expressed its willingness to assist Romania in its economic construction technically and financially. The main points of the protocol are as follows: (1) Germany will provide huge long-term loans necessary for Romania to implement the ten-year plan to assist Romania. (2) Germany will continue to cooperate with Romania in agriculture and forestry and will provide credit loans to Romania for the agricultural tools, machinery, and other agricultural equipment it needs. (3) Germany will provide technical and financial assistance to Romania to revitalize its industry. (4) Germany will provide credit loans to Romania for the materials and pipelines necessary to expand its railways and highways. (5) In addition to providing long-term loans, Germany will provide Romania's industry, banks, and trust businesses with the capital they need based on private economic cooperation. (6) At the request of Romania, the German government will send agricultural, industrial, technical, and other experts to Romania. (7) The German market will always sell Romanian products at fair prices, and the Romanian market will also promote business relations with Germany as a principle. (8) The governments of Germany and Romania expressed their satisfaction with the German-Romanian cooperation that has already begun and decided to guarantee mutually beneficial production cooperation. The protocol reveals that Romania's agricultural and industrial production will become more developed due to German economic cooperation. Therefore, Germany is expected to purchase large quantities of oil, grain, and livestock from Romania, which shows that this matter also has significant political implications for the British blockade measures.

<h3>Romanian Government Adopts Severe Measures to Control Romanian Oil Fields; Oil Pipelines in Romania Nationalized</h3>
<p>Bucharest The Antonescu government took over all private oil pipelines in Romania yesterday to strengthen totalitarian control over Romania, which has been shaken by the recent Iron Guard riots. Those affected include the American Romanian Oil Company, a subsidiary of the New Jersey-based Mobil Oil Company of the United States, and companies with Jewish shareholders. The Romanian government also ordered the purchase of its inland river vessels, which are also operated by Jewish shareholders, further affecting British and American investment. Companies purchased by the government will be paid with Romanian government bonds with a term of 25 years and an interest rate of 3%. At the same time, it is reported that the government has adopted severe measures to remove Iron Guard extremists from various agencies. (5th, International Telegram)</p>
<p>Bucharest The government recently issued an order nationalizing all oil pipelines in the country. In the future, the construction of new pipelines will be handled by the government. (4th, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>Bucharest In the first ten months of this year, Romania produced 4,943,000 tons of crude oil, and a total of 205,000 meters of new oil wells were drilled. If operations continue in the same situation in November and December, the oil production this year may reach 5.8 million tons, and the new oil wells may reach 240,000 meters. Compared with last year, oil production decreased by 7.05%, and new oil wells decreased by 625%. Daily oil production decreased from 1,700 truckloads in summer to 1,400 truckloads.

In addition to Vers, 23 other people were charged. The indictment stated that the group planned to use two large cars, each carrying 50 armed members, holding machine guns and automatic pistols, to sneak into the motorcycle guard unit, follow the Regent, arrest him, and imprison him. Other charges included plans to occupy radio stations, police stations, and various ministries. The trial will begin on December 16. (5th, Huitong News Agency)</p>
<h3>Hungarian Foreign Minister to Visit Southern Country</h3>
<p>Southern Country Capital According to responsible authorities here last night, Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky will soon visit the Southern Country. Given the increasing friendship between the two countries, this is not an unusual move. The date of his arrival in the Southern Country and the arrangements for his reception have not been decided. According to well-informed sources, the Hungarian Foreign Minister may depart within ten days, as the two governments have already begun diplomatic negotiations. In early 1939, the Foreign Minister was preparing to come here to sign a treaty of non-aggression and friendship, but it did not happen due to the coup in the Southern Country and the outbreak of the European War. Political circles here believe that cooperation between the two countries is sufficient to maintain peace in Southeast Europe. It is believed here that the Foreign Minister's speech in Congress a few days ago was also of great help to peace in the Balkans. This policy of Southeast European countries is in line with the goals of the Axis powers and is of great value for the reorganization of Europe. (5th, Huitong News Agency)</p>

<h3>Trade Agreement Concluded Between Britain and Turkey; Has Political Nature</h3>
<p>London Britain and Turkey have now concluded an agreement that is expected to increase trade between the two countries by facilitating the exchange of goods. The agreement stipulates that during the effective period, Britain and Turkey will make payments according to the current exchange rate between the pound sterling and the Turkish pound and will set up special accounts to facilitate commercial and other payments between the two countries. This agreement supplements the trade payment agreement signed between Britain and Turkey on February 2. A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that the new British-Turkish agreement is not only commercial in nature but also has a political nature. In practical terms, it is a challenge from the British government to Germany's economic dominance in the Balkan Peninsula. It is widely believed that Germany may make attractive commercial proposals to the Turkish government, but the conclusion of this agreement between Britain and Turkey will prevent Germany from regaining its dominance in Turkey's economic life. The British and Turkish governments held lengthy discussions before concluding this agreement, and Turkey's entire commercial relationship with Britain and its colonies was included to enable Britain to purchase agricultural products that are beneficial to Turkey's national economy. These purchases will amount to millions of pounds. The Turkish government and local authorities will also import goods needed by government agencies and commodities such as wool needed by manufacturers from Britain and its colonies. The British commercial company, which aims to promote trade between Britain and the Near East, will fully utilize its activities. This company is privately owned and has greatly expanded its scope since its establishment in April. (5th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Soviet-Romanian Trade Negotiations Underway</h3>

<h3>Turkey Controls Grain</h3>
<p>Ankara The Turkish government is planning to establish a new grain division within the Ministry of Trade to manage issues such as grain production, supply, distribution, and prices. The purpose of this move is obviously to prevent grain panics and to punish unscrupulous merchants who hoard grain. (5th, Huitong News Agency)</p>
<h3>British Weather Worsens; German Aircraft Activity Decreases; West Midlands Bombed</h3>
<p>London There was very little activity by enemy aircraft over Britain yesterday. An Air Ministry communiqué stated that bombs fell in Dover shortly after noon, causing slight material damage and few casualties. British fighters shot down a German bomber off the Dutch coast. No British aircraft were lost. (5th, Reuters)</p>
<p>London Last night and early this morning, gloomy weather again halted German aircraft's attacks on Britain. German aircraft suddenly eased their blitz after only a few hours of bombing in the Midlands last night, presumably because of bad weather over the German airbases, making takeoff dangerous. There were no piercing air raid sirens in London all day Wednesday, and the night was also relatively quiet. The sirens were lifted before midnight, and London residents were able to enjoy a much-needed rest, awakening only to the sound of factory whistles at dawn. Dover and a town in eastern England were subjected to lighter air raids during the day, with almost no losses. One German aircraft was chased across the Channel and shot down. The aircraft crashed into the sea, engulfed in flames. (5th, International News Agency)</p>
<p>London Yesterday, central and coastal areas of Britain were again subjected to the atrocities of the German air force. A few "samples" also fell on London itself. After a relatively quiet day, groups of German aircraft flew over the British coast at dusk, selecting a city in the eastern Midlands as the main target for the night raid. After dropping a large number of bombs, the German aircraft groups flew south to other central areas. Officials here declared that the organized British counter-offensive had crippled most of the German railway network, and more than half of the coal in the Ruhr area was stockpiled and untransported due to a lack of transportation equipment.

<h3>British Fighters Equipped with Steel Cannons</h3>
<p>London British fighters are now equipped with steel cannons. Several German aircraft that were recently destroyed were shot down by this new type of weapon. The advantage of this steel cannon over machine guns is that it has a longer range and greater destructive power. It is reported that the United States will provide Britain with the famous American-made long-barreled 1.17-caliber steel cannon. (5th, Reuters)</p>
<p>A Tragic History of the European War (4)</p>
<h3>The Inside Story of How Déat and Reynaud's Affairs Misled the Country</h3>
<p>I said to Reynaud, "If you are ordered to form a cabinet, you must also try to get the support of Daladier. He is still deeply loved by the people in the country!"</p>
<p>"That's because the people haven't understood what kind of person he is."</p>
<p>"Perhaps, but you must also consider the facts. Although you are talented, you have no followers. The Radical Party is still loyal to Daladier. Although you belong to the right wing, because you despise them and don't hide it, the right wing also tends to support Daladier."</p>
<p>He smiled slightly and said, "If the President orders me to form a cabinet, I will naturally try to keep Daladier as Minister of War." At ten o'clock, he went to the Chamber of Deputies. As Reynaud expected, Prime Minister Daladier resigned that evening. President Lebrun immediately summoned Reynaud and asked him to form a cabinet. He did not hesitate and immediately agreed. This time, that extremely intelligent person completely ignored public opinion and was out of touch with the times.</p>
<p>After Reynaud formed a cabinet and attended Parliament, he struggled with all his might and barely managed to secure a majority! Parliament did not like him and regretted overthrowing Daladier. Reynaud felt the strong hostile atmosphere and suddenly lost his usual confidence, and his speech was lackluster and perfunctory.</p>
<p>The next day, I returned to my defensive position in Arras and felt that everyone on the train was deeply surprised to hear that Reynaud had formed a cabinet. They all believed that this move was tantamount to challenging public opinion. It was indeed a matter that could not be ignored that the government and the majority of the people had such a rift in wartime. Since Reynaud took office as Prime Minister, I have not seen him once. Therefore, I used congratulations as an excuse and quoted a famous saying from the French revolutionary Barère to him: "In times of peace, Parliament represents the whole country, but in times of war, the army represents it." And added a sentence saying: "Don't lose contact with the army."</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, Reynaud has expressed his opposition to Gamelin, saying that as commander-in-chief, he has not taken any action, and the army has no faith in him. It is also difficult to say whether these issues are right or wrong, so let's not discuss them for the time being. In September 1939, Gamelin did not launch a fierce attack on Germany's Siegfried Line, but only took cautious military action in the Saar region, which is a fact. His political enemies took the opportunity to say that at this time, most of the German troops were fighting in Poland, which was a great opportunity to attack. Gamelin believed that at the beginning of the war, France lacked the necessary equipment to launch an offensive and had no support from a large number of aircraft and heavy artillery. If it rashly attacked, it would suffer heavy losses.</p>
<p>Gamelin once said, "I don't want to start the war with the Battle of Verdun." He explained this sentence by saying, "France's population productivity was originally very low, and the last major war had already dealt a heavy blow, and it could not withstand the great bloodshed of the Battle of Verdun again. This war will be a scientific war, and everything can be predicted in advance. The casualties on both sides will inevitably be few."</p>
<p>I admit that at the time, I very much agreed with his attitude. Outsiders should not rashly criticize Gamelin's talent as a general. In the Battle of the Marne, he was a consultant to Marshal Joffre and was the first to see this clever plan to turn defeat into victory. He was an example of a colleague in the General Staff, and later he was able to command divisions on the battlefield and make people deeply admire him.</p>
<p>If you meet him for the first time, his elusive personality will surprise you. His two small mustaches are short and stiff, his eyes are small, and his lips are thin, with a mysterious and incredible color. He does not have the vigor of General Foch, nor the sincerity and attentiveness of General Joffre. He is taciturn and often does not say a word during meals. But his character is gentle and polite, and his subordinates all have a good impression of him. I also feel that he is very kind. When he first arrived at the headquarters of General Gort, commander of the British Expeditionary Force, he saw me wearing a lieutenant's uniform and asked, "What? Are you still a lieutenant at this age?"</p>
<p>"General, I have been a lieutenant since the end of the last European War until now."</p>
<p>He laughed loudly and said, "Haven't you been promoted in twenty years! It's too long. I'm going to promote you to captain."</p>
<p>The second time he came, I was still a lieutenant. He was very surprised.</p>
<p>He asked Colonel Pettybone, "What? Didn't I already tell you to call the Ministry of War and say that Mr. Mollet should be promoted to captain?"</p>
<p>The colonel replied, "General, I have followed your orders, but there are many obstacles ahead. According to the regulations, you must undergo two training periods to be eligible for promotion, but Mr. Mollet has only undergone one training period."</p>
<p>When Gamelin heard this, he turned to General Gort and said, "It can be seen that there are difficulties in everything. But I think it shouldn't be too much trouble for a commander-in-chief to promote a lieutenant to captain!"</p>
<p>After I was promoted, Gamelin wrote me a short note with earnest words, saying, "You have finally been promoted! But I dare not congratulate you on being promoted so late." He also asked me to meet him at the Weissembourg headquarters. I still remember the dinner in the fort's cellar that day. In addition to me, those present were General Nogues, Gamelin's confidant who commanded the troops stationed in North Africa, and Paul-Boncour, the French ambassador to Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>All that was discussed was serious business. General Nogues spoke about the needs of his troops, and Paul-Boncour spoke about Yugoslavia's contract to purchase military equipment from France, which had not been fulfilled. Gamelin's answers were clear and concise. He also asked me how the British 51st Division, which was heading to the Saar, was doing. Later, he talked about the French Academy and the dictionaries it compiled, and he said to me, "We now need to come up with a nickname for the soldiers participating in the war. In 1914, French soldiers were called 'Bearded Soldiers' because they had been in the trenches for a long time and had full beards, but in 1940, French soldiers still don't have a 'nickname'."</p>
<p>Paul-Boncour asked him when the German army would attack.</p>
<p>He said, "Yes. Everything indicates that they are about to attack. French aviators and spies have already seen all kinds of German preparations for the attack, such as the concentration of artillery, the stockpiling of military supplies, and the evacuation of civilians, etc." (To be continued) Written by Captain Mollet, the original author of this article</p>

<h3>The Two Concession Authorities and All Sectors Should Cooperatively Stabilize Rice Prices, With Estimated Rice Reserves of Two Million Bags Citywide; Legitimate Business Operations of Rice Merchants Should Be Protected; Mr. Yu Qiaqing Reports on His Rice Purchases Since April</h3>
<p>Since the authorities here deemed there to be manipulation and speculative hoarding of rice, having issued a proclamation that such behavior would not be protected, and having repeatedly implemented price controls, the rice prices have only risen higher with each restriction. Merchants and citizens alike are burdened by their livelihood, wearing worried expressions, and society is uneasy. All parties have calmly researched, patiently advised, and attempted to salvage the perilous situation. The two concession authorities have also repeatedly resolved to find ways to stabilize prices. However, with the new grain just entering the market, and foreign exchange rates extremely stable, the rice market has recently experienced drastic changes. This reporter from the "Pingming" (Common People) Society yesterday specifically visited a certain expert in the local business community, who believes this is a temporary phenomenon and expresses his views as follows:</p>
<p>Wealthy Households Compete to Purchase, Creating High Prices</p>
<p>Recently, Shanghai's rice prices have been dominated by foreign rice, and foreign rice prices are converted according to exchange rates. Currently, as domestic rice is entering the market and foreign exchange rates are extremely stable, there should be no reason for foreign rice prices to rise. Even though the situation in Saigon (source of rice) is tense, supplies have not been cut off. The main reason for the price increase is that speculators are taking advantage of the situation, deliberately spreading news of insufficient food supplies, causing the public to rush to hoard. Shanghai's population is said to be four million. If wealthy households account for one percent, and each person hoards ten bags, the total reaches 400,000 bags. If the market suddenly faces such a large demand, how can market prices not rise? The expert then cited a newspaper article by a certain person, claiming that the city's rice reserves were only several hundred thousand bags, which is incorrect. This inadvertently promotes the increase in rice prices. According to reliable estimates, rice reserves in individual households in the city are at least two million bags or more. The so-called reserve of several hundred thousand bags refers only to the amount stored in warehouses. The main source of foreign rice is Vietnam, and shipments have not been interrupted. Although Vietnam is a production area, market prices are determined by production and sales. Since the founding of our nation, foreign rice imports have never been as high as they are now, which also marks a new era in Vietnamese rice exports. Promoting hoarding at this time will only make Vietnamese rice more expensive, harming oneself and others, which is extremely inconsistent with economic principles. The expert specifically emphasized that the current grain price increase completely exceeds the Vietnamese production price, and that individual households, unaware of the truth, blindly follow the trend of hoarding rice, which is the most unwise action.</p>
<p>Group Rice Purchases Should Be Handled with Caution</p>
<p>The expert continued to discuss that while the intention behind Shanghai's various sectors promoting group rice purchases is acceptable, the following should be noted: (1) Group rice purchases may create the appearance of promoting hoarding. (2) Group rice purchases should be directly ordered from Saigon, not purchased in Shanghai, to avoid being exploited by local hoarders. (3) Group rice purchases should avoid business conflicts with merchants, as rice merchants are not all "rice weevils." In fact, they are the main figures in facilitating food supplies. If their livelihoods are cut off, no one will be available for transportation, which may affect supplies. As for balancing current rice prices, the expert believes that the best way is to implement public sales of food. In Shanghai, the first step is to explain the reasons for the current rice price increase. Food is not lacking, but if everyone rushes to hoard, it may incite a panic. Some people are now promoting the purchase of rice to store 100,000 shi (unit of volume), as a reserve for future use, so that there will always be 200,000 shi of rice in the market. The intention is very good, but the quantity is not large enough. The supply and sales of rice are the same as the supply and sales of ordinary commodities. The main method is to facilitate supplies, not to hoard. It is hoped that legitimate rice merchants will order continuously, so that supply and demand will be normal, which is the only way to prevent monopolies.</p>
<p>Foreign Newspapers Report Black Market Transactions</p>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury," Vietnamese rice has arrived in Shanghai, and large quantities have reportedly been purchased from Rangoon. Foreign rice prices have fallen slightly. After the Shanghai Rice and Bean Trade Association recently set a maximum price for foreign rice, it is rumored that black market transactions are occurring at prices higher than the limit. The Public Works Department (工部局) is investigating this. However, according to a spokesman for the PWD, the maximum rice price limit has restrained those who illegally profit from price gouging. Very few rice merchants are selling rice above the limit. Although the Japanese are still prohibiting the shipment of domestic rice, the rice situation here is still satisfactory.</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing's Letter to the PWD</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Qiaqing's letter to the Public Works Department of the Public Concession yesterday stated: "Recently, domestic rice prices have reached 100 yuan per shi, and foreign rice prices have reached 80 yuan per shi, with a continued upward trend. The reason is that rumors in the market claim that Saigon has been closed and cannot export, and that rice stored in warehouses in Hongkou cannot be transported into the central district of the concessions. These rumors create opportunities for speculative price increases, which is truly heartbreaking. However, in reality, Saigon shipments for orders placed before November 26 can continue to be loaded and exported. The banned rice is No. 1 old rice, and new rice can still be ordered after November 25, which is not enough to affect the overall situation. However, transportation is somewhat difficult, as British and Norwegian ships are ordered not to sail to Annam (Vietnam). Ship space is gradually decreasing due to the European war, and freight rates are inevitably rising, from 6 US dollars to 10 US dollars per ton, and no ships can be found for the time being.</p>
<p>Selling Foreign Rice at Cost</p>
<p>Furthermore, due to the current situation, war risk insurance premiums have increased from 25 yuan to 50 yuan per thousand yuan. Calculated in this way, the cost of each bag of Saigon rice has increased by about 10 yuan. Seeing this situation, I sold 36,000 bags of rice from my previous shipments on the "Haida" and "Dade" ships at a low price of 74.56 yuan per bag of 220 pounds, with a cost of 80 yuan per bag of 320 pounds. A list of the households sold to is attached for reference. This is well known among rice industry insiders, but outsiders who are not aware of the situation have many misunderstandings, which is deeply disappointing. I have been in the shipping business for a long time and have close ties with shipping companies, so I was able to negotiate a reduction in freight costs. For example, the freight cost of 6 US dollars per ton was reduced to 4.5 US dollars, so the cost of 83 yuan per bag of rice could be reduced to about 80 yuan. I then sold it at a low price of 74 to 76 yuan per bag to maintain market conditions, incurring losses rather than profiting, which is truly unfair. I have been doing business in Shanghai for nearly 60 years and have been unfairly praised by society. My conscience is clear, but I still cannot dispel the doubts of the public. Ordinary rice merchants who seek profit would never dare to take on such a huge risk.</p>
<p>Proposing Rice Purchases for Storage</p>
<p>However, no one is continuing to order, and reserves are dwindling. If this continues, the crisis will worsen day by day, leading to an unbearable situation. Your bureau bears the heavy responsibility of local municipal administration. As a director of the board, I feel concerned and dare not remain silent. I propose that the Public Works Departments of the French and International Concessions immediately convene representatives from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the banking and money industries, the rice industry, and the yarn factories to jointly discuss raising funds to purchase 200,000 bags of Saigon rice as a foundation. Some would be sold from time to time, and some would be replenished to maintain a continuous flow. With this storage, panic can be prevented and the market stabilized, which would not only benefit various industries but also greatly benefit the municipal administration of the concessions. Furthermore, regarding my handling of foreign rice purchases since April, a separate report has been prepared for your consideration. There are many rumors outside that I am hoarding large quantities of rice. Fortunately, all foreign rice imports are stored in warehouses, so it is easy to investigate whether there is any hoarding. I request that your bureau immediately send personnel to thoroughly investigate the warehouses, announce the facts, clarify the truth, and dispel doubts. I sincerely hope for your consideration. This is addressed to the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Public Concession."</p>
<h3>Assassination in Suzhou</h3>
<p>According to a report from Suzhou via a traveler arriving in Shanghai yesterday, an assassination occurred in a busy area of Suzhou on the morning of the 4th. The target was Peng Zijia, a member of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, aged 64. Peng was leaving his residence on Shiquan Street in the city when he was suddenly shot. Peng, caught off guard, was shot twice in the chest and other areas, immediately falling into a pool of blood and dying. The city was immediately placed under martial law, but the shooter escaped without a trace.</p>
<h3>Japanese Izumo Warship Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The flagship of the Japanese Third Fleet, the Izumo, left Shanghai on the afternoon of the 26th of last month for Ningbo, stayed in Ningbo for a week, and sailed downriver the day before yesterday, returning to Shanghai at 2 pm yesterday. It is still docked at the China Merchants Bureau wharf in Hongkou.</p>
<h3>Relaxation of the West Shanghai Blockade; New Developments in the Area; Notices Publicly Insulting the British Posted; Japanese Merchant Buses Operating on Two Routes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a British official here told reporters that the posters in West Shanghai denouncing Major Hentot, the British Consul-General's military attache and liaison officer to the Japanese army, had been torn down after British Consul-General George negotiated with the Japanese authorities. The posters were written in English, but with incorrect grammar and incoherent language. The general content seemed to accuse Major Hentot of harboring "malice" and stated that people like Hentot were not allowed to pass through the blockade line. Major Hentot told reporters that he was the liaison officer to the Japanese army sent by the British Consulate-General, so even with such absurd warnings, he would still enter and exit the blocked area as usual. He had never encountered any unpleasant incidents in the blocked area and did not know the reason for the ridiculous posters. A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy said that he did not know who posted the posters, and it could not be confirmed whether they were posted by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Notices Posted on Eight Wooden Boards</p>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury," the Japanese authorities in West Shanghai today (the 5th) erected eight wooden boards on obstacles in the blocked area, with English notices posted on them, denouncing Major Hentot, the British Consulate's liaison officer to the Japanese army. The contents of the notices were incomprehensible and obviously meaningless, leaving observers greatly puzzled. The notices stated, "Major Hentot, the military attache of the British Consulate, made unfair remarks, such as... At the request of the gas company, are these winding paths set up by the Japanese military police? Anyone with malice like Major Hentot is strictly prohibited from passing. Printed by the Military Police West District Command."</p>
<p>British Consul-General to Lodge a Protest</p>
<p>Major Hentot replied to reporters that he was drafting a report on the posting of the notices, which he would submit to British Consul-General George for handling. He visited the obstacles in the "blocked area" this morning, saw the notices, and reported them to the British Consul-General. Beyond that, Major Hentot declined to say more. It is heard that the British authorities may lodge a protest regarding this matter.</p>
<p>The Blockade Situation Appears to Be Relaxing</p>
<p>At the same time, the blockade situation appears to be relaxing today. Residents of No. 54 Great Western Road (next to Lane 54, where Japanese military policeman Sasaki was assassinated) were allowed to move out this morning. A truck driven by a Chinese chauffeur drove to the house to load furniture. However, the Chinese coolies who went with the truck to help move were not allowed past the obstacle. Japanese officials were unable to determine today when the blockade would be lifted this week but said that it would be lifted once the household search was completed. In addition, food and other necessities are now allowed to be sent into the blocked area, but they are subject to strict inspection.</p>
<p>Traffic Still Cut Off at Night</p>
<p>Yesterday's blockade line remained the same as the day before. However, foreign and Chinese students are free to enter and exit various places. The French Concession police and the Chinese police force posted a joint notice at the entrances of each blockade line, the contents of which are recorded as follows: "Notice: It has been investigated that there are three places where residents of the blocked area can enter and exit the city: the intersection of Great Western Road and Yidingpan Road, the intersection of Yuyuan Road and Yidingpan Road, and Qianjia Lane. However, only silver cars and private cars are allowed to pass through for those taking vehicles. All other vehicles are prohibited from passing. A map is attached to the notice." A printed map was posted below the notice. The reporter from Dazhong News Agency immediately went to the three open locations to inspect. It was seen that there was no congestion and that the inspection was quite strict. Foreigners and Chinese and Western students can pass through everywhere and are not limited to the three listed locations, while vehicles, regardless of Chinese or foreign, are only allowed to pass through in those three places. After 8 pm, all traffic is still cut off.</p>
<p>Long Streets Empty in the Blocked Area</p>
<p>By 4 pm, the so-called "West Shanghai Public Bus" was operating within the two blockade lines at the intersection of Haig Road and Jing'an Temple Road and next to the Paramount Ballroom. Those entering must take this bus and are not allowed to walk through the small gaps. The "public buses" are painted dark green, with the words "Public Can Sit" written on the back. The policemen next to the blockade line are soliciting business. One route runs on Jing'an Temple Road and Great Western Road, and the other route runs on Yuyuan Road. The fare is uniformly 20 cents per person, with the Zhaofeng Garden as the terminus. However, there were few passengers, as people were afraid to enter, fearing other troubles. Therefore, although some people urgently wanted to enter to visit relatives and friends, they all hesitated to proceed. The reporter, in order to see what was happening, also took the "Route 2" bus at the Yuyuan Road blockade line around 5 pm to Yidingpan Road. The reporter saw few pedestrians along the way. The long streets were empty, and the shops were closed. The market on Yidingpan Road was also quieter than usual. The reporter then took "Route 1" back to Jing'an Temple Road. It is heard that Wangjia Lane can also be entered, but there are military police stationed around, and inspections are very strict. Prices within the blockade line are still high. Although residents know that the situation has eased slightly, they are all uneasy about the future.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchant Buses Publicly Carry Passengers</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to foreign sources, West Shanghai, which has been blockaded by the Japanese army for five days, seems to be further away from the jurisdiction of the Public Works Department in the extraterritorial road area of West Shanghai. Yesterday, two Japanese merchant public buses were found on Yuyuan Road and Great Western Road. This directly infringes on the patent rights of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company. At 3:15 pm yesterday, two Japanese merchant public buses, the same type as those operating in Hongkou, began operating between Difeng Road and Zhaofeng Garden. Soon after, two more buses were operating on Great Western Road. At the same time, notices were erected next to each obstacle, stating that Chinese who take these Japanese merchant public buses can avoid various restrictions. Well-informed sources pointed out that the various restrictions set up during the West Shanghai blockade were to prepare for the operation of the Japanese merchant public buses. The source also stated that although there are not many Japanese merchant public buses operating in the extraterritorial road area, their illegality is certain. In other words, even one bus, if it runs on a fixed route and charges passengers, is enough to constitute a violation of the patent rights of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company. A senior official of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company stated that a protest has already been lodged regarding this matter, but it is not yet known...</p>
<h3>Telephone Price Increase to Take Effect Tomorrow</h3>
<p>After the PWD approved the telephone company's proposal to increase prices, various local organizations jointly appealed, requesting the concession authorities to carefully consider the matter and that the reasons given by the company for the price increase be reviewed. They also requested that the Chinese directors of the PWD do their utmost to argue for a postponement. However, the authorities did not consider this request, so the price increase will take effect tomorrow.</p>
<h3>New Stamps to Be Printed by Year-End</h3>
<p>The new stamps that the Directorate General of Posts has commissioned Hong Kong to print will have denominations of 2 cents, 4 cents, 8 cents, 12 cents, 24 cents, 18 cents, and 36 cents. The layout will not be much different from the previous stamps, but the colors will be different. These new stamps will be printed by the end of this month and can be shipped to Shanghai for sale by New Year's Day next year.</p>
<h3>Price Increase for Airmail Envelopes and Stationery</h3>
<p>The Postal Administration announces that due to soaring raw material prices, the selling prices of the airmail envelopes and stationery sold by this Bureau have been revised by the Directorate General of Posts as follows: Airmail stationery sets (one envelope and two sheets of stationery) are 5 cents in national currency, and airmail stationery (Chinese or Western style) is 1.5 cents in national currency per sheet. This will take effect from the 5th.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Demands Made by Chinese Police, Etc. Yesterday; Principles to Be Agreed Upon Before Submitting Recommendations; Final Decision to Be Made by the Board of Directors</h3>
<p>Recently, rice prices in the area have soared, and the cost of living has continued to increase. Chinese police and fire department employees of the Public Concession have successively made demands to improve their treatment. The terms of their demands have been submitted to the authorities for review and are awaiting a response. It is learned that the concession authorities held a personnel committee yesterday afternoon at 3 pm specifically to discuss this issue. It is heard that Xi Yushu attended on behalf of the Chinese side and gave a detailed report and discussion on the demands made by the Chinese police. According to a senior official of the PWD, the committee only discussed the issue of improving treatment in principle yesterday. The authorities' decision on this matter will depend on the personnel committee's recommendations being submitted to the board of directors for discussion, as approving the demands of the Chinese police and fire department employees would increase the annual financial expenditure of the bureau by several million yuan, so a comprehensive and thorough study must be conducted.</p>
<p>Specific Measures Still Under Study</p>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury," regarding the demands made by the Chinese employees of the Public Concession Fire Department and Police Department earlier this week for increased allowances, the PWD made no statement this morning. According to a spokesman for the PWD, the bureau's decision on these demands will depend on the results of the study. It cannot be confirmed whether they will be fully approved.</p>
<p>Better Treatment Avoids Disputes</p>
<p>When asked if the PWD would take measures to prevent the recurrence of Chinese police neglect of duty, the spokesman said that he could not answer that question, but if the salary base of the Chinese police is satisfactory, such a crisis can be expected to be avoided in the future. At the same time, personnel in the fire and police departments are working as usual, awaiting the results of the PWD's study of their demands.</p>
<h3>French Concession Publishes Crime Statistics for November</h3>
<p>In the French Concession, criminal cases invariably increase every winter. November of this year was no exception. However, thanks to increased vigilance by the authorities, the number of criminal cases increased was not severe. Whenever the police received timely warnings, they were able to deal with them effectively. The statistics for criminal cases in November are as follows: In no less than four cases, victims reported to the police, confronted the thieves on the spot, and captured them. There was one assassination case: the first case was a Chinese woman who was strangled to death in an inn. The murderer was soon caught and, according to investigation, was a crime of passion. The second case involved a Sikh policeman who was robbed of his pistol and seriously wounded in the leg, dying of his injuries. In addition, one of the two murderers in an assassination case in October has now been arrested. That case was a gang fight, and an accomplice has also been arrested. There were two kidnapping cases: in both cases, the police rescued the victims and arrested the kidnappers. The first case involved two children who were kidnapped by their relatives under the pretext of watching a movie in West Shanghai. Because the police found the kidnappers' lair, the kidnappers were forced to release the victims. Although one of the three kidnappers had a pistol, all were arrested. The second kidnapping case involved a five-year-old child who was kidnapped by a neighboring handyman. It was later discovered that the child was being held in the Public Concession and was rescued, and five kidnappers were arrested. In addition, there were 31 theft cases, two attempted cases, and two cases of residential intrusion. There were also two cases of robbers from the previous month, and seven of the current theft cases have been solved. There are also 19 petty theft cases and 38 vandalism cases. The police also seized four pistols in 10 searches for theft cases, and 17 theft cases were solved in 25 searches.</p>
<h3>Procedures for Travelers to Hong Kong; Hong Kong Civil Affairs Department Has Issued a Notice</h3>
<p>Regarding entry procedures for travelers from Shanghai to Hong Kong since the Hong Kong government promulgated the Immigration Restriction Ordinance, the Taikoo and Jardine shipping companies in Shanghai have telegraphed Hong Kong for inquiries. According to a telegram received by the shipping industry, the Hong Kong government's Department of Chinese Civil Affairs has issued a notice stating, "Notice: It has been learned that from December 17 of this year, no person of any nationality will be allowed to return to the Hong Kong territory without any of the following certificates: (1) Valid passport, (2) Residence permit, (3) Entry permit. Anyone wishing to obtain item seven certificates may apply to the Immigration Department for issuance from November 18 of this year, from 9 am to 4 pm. Fees must be paid for obtaining the certificate. Children under the age of 15 do not need to obtain a certificate if their parents hold the above certificate. Anyone leaving Shanghai who intends to return after December 17 of this year should take care to obtain a certificate before leaving Shanghai, otherwise they may encounter difficulties upon their return, many inconveniences, or even be detained in the People's Immigration Inspection Center and sent back to their original location. All persons residing in Hong Kong may obtain certificates for their relatives and friends outside Hong Kong, but they must still submit photos of those relatives and friends when applying. This notice is hereby issued for general information." The establishment of an office of the Hong Kong Immigration Department in Shanghai is still in preparation.</p>
<h3>Two American Ships Fully Loaded With Overseas Chinese to Return to China This Year; Tickets for Both Ships Are Now Fully Booked; More Than Forty Pastors of the Presbyterian Church Will Travel Together</h3>
<p>Two American President Lines ships sailing from Shanghai soon will be fully loaded with evacuated American nationals and returning to America. The two ships are the President Cleveland (departing December 10) and the President Coolidge (departing December 31). Tickets are now fully booked. Many passengers have reserved berths since the U.S. government advised Americans in the Far East to retreat. The President Coolidge will sail directly from Japan to Manila and will not call at Japan. The rumor that the ship is carrying aircraft, pilots, and military equipment to strengthen the defenses of the Philippines has not been confirmed today. An official of the President Lines said that he was unaware of the rumor. The above two ships will both call at Kobe after leaving Shanghai and then cross the Pacific to return to the United States. The ships will be fully booked with passengers.</p>
<p>Church Personnel Will Return One After Another</p>
<p>It is learned that among the Americans returning to the United States on the President Coolidge at the end of this year are more than 40 pastors from the Presbyterian Church. All travel expenses are paid from the Church Missions Fund. In addition to these 40 people, 30 pastors from the Presbyterian Church returned to the United States on the Washington on the 20th of last month. The church's current evacuation plan will continue until March 1 of next year, as other churches will then carry out evacuations. When the U.S. State Department advised American nationals in the Far East to evacuate, almost all of the pastors were unwilling to leave their posts and return home. A month later, Bishop Roberts, a special envoy from the American Church General Assembly, was sent to Shanghai to preside over and supervise the evacuation of the pastors, so the church decided to send women and children back to the United States one after another. In addition to the 40 people being evacuated at the end of the month, more than 1,000 Americans from the church will be evacuated in March of next year.</p>
<h3>Large Quantity of Winter Clothing from America to be Shipped to Shanghai on Schedule, To Be Distributed by the American Friends Service Committee</h3>
<p>The American Friends Service Committee in Shanghai is composed of church members and is directly affiliated with the New York headquarters. Since its establishment more than a year ago, it has been committed to refugee relief work and has a high reputation. It provides even more benefits to Jewish people who have been displaced and driven from Europe to Shanghai. The committee has set up an office in Hongkou and cares for all Jewish people, providing medical care, distributing medicine, and giving out winter clothing. Their enthusiastic service is commendable. Recently, they received a telegram from the New York headquarters stating that a large quantity of winter clothing in San Francisco could not be shipped to Europe due to transportation difficulties and would be rerouted to Shanghai. It is now learned that the clothing, totaling two large packages, has been loaded onto the President Cleveland and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 9th. It will be handed over to the American Friends Service Committee for distribution to various Jewish refugee camps. If there is a surplus, it will be donated to other relevant organizations for distribution to refugees to help them get through the winter. In addition, the Jewish Relief Committee received a donation of 1,053 yuan from Ms. Hess yesterday, specifically for the use of the Jewish Hospital. This donation was raised at a concert held at the Asiatic Society last Saturday. The total ticket revenue was 1,196.67 yuan, and after deducting all expenses of 145.89 yuan, the remainder was transferred to the Jewish Hospital's fund.</p>
<h3>Greek Merchant Ship Aground En Route</h3>
<p>No Major Damage, Refloated with Rising Tide</p>
<p>The Ta Lu Pao reports: The Sino-Greek Shipping Company in this city recently stated that its cargo ship, the Greek Merchant (2,000 tons), ran aground on a sandbar off the coast of South China while en route to Vietnam. It did not suffer significant damage and was refloated by the crew with the rising tide. It is now safely anchored in an outer harbor of Hainan Island. When the ship was refloated, another ship, name unknown, was nearby. A British tug assisting in the rescue has been recalled. All personnel aboard the Greek Merchant are safe. Once the minor damage to the ship is repaired, it will continue its journey.</p>

<h3>Flower Firm Robbed of 10,000 Yuan, Broker Suspected and Detained, Six Robbers Suddenly Arrived and Intercepted the Car Carrying the Money, Gambling Chips Found on Broker</h3>
<p>The Shen Yu Flower Firm at 590 Bazih Road recently sold cotton worth over 10,000 yuan to the Hua Office of the Yong An Cotton Mill’s 491 Lane, Maigeng Road, handled by a broker named Xi Bingsheng from Pudong (resident at No. 1, Gongyi Lane, Zhujie Street, Nanshi). At 1:30 PM the day before yesterday, Xu Xuemin, a partner from the flower firm from Ningbo, went with Xi Bingsheng to the Yong An Hua Office to</p>
<p>Collect Payment</p>
<p>A total of 10,000 yuan in legal tender. Xi hired a car from the Xiang Sheng Company, parked near Changping Road, Maigeng Road. Xu initially intended to wrap the legal tender in newspaper, but Xi suggested it was not proper and changed it to a cloth bag. The two walked together to the hired car. Suddenly, six robbers appeared next to the car. Two had handguns and surrounded Xu, aiming their guns at his chest,</p>
<p>Intimidating</p>
<p>And shouting. They snatched the cloth bag containing the legal tender and fled in different directions. Xu and the broker Xi reported the incident to the Gorden Road Police Station. Chinese Detective Xie Zhiguang and Detective Zhao Ji, along with Western detectives, rushed to the scene to investigate. Suspecting that broker Xi Bingsheng was involved with the robbers, they immediately</p>
<p>Detained</p>
<p>Him. A bundle of gambling chips was found on his person. The police chief ordered his detention. Yesterday, he was brought to the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the case and requested detention. Xu further testified about what happened during the robbery. Xi Bingsheng’s testimony was evasive. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered that he remain in custody and adjourned the hearing for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Gambling King Lai Ailai's Whereabouts Mysterious, US Court Issues Arrest Warrant</h3>
<p>The English-language *North China Daily News* reported that Lai Ailai, Shanghai's "Slot Machine King," did not appear in the U.S. Court for China yesterday (the 4th) for trial. The U.S. Court not only confiscated his bail of 25,000 yuan but also issued a warrant for his arrest and notified Chinese and Japanese authorities at various ports of Lai's escape, requesting widespread investigation to arrest him. As for Lai's current whereabouts, rumors are rampant. Some say he flew to Japan yesterday afternoon; others say he is hiding in the Western District or Hongkou. The truth is unknown.</p>
<h3>Arrest of Native Opium Dealers, Arrest of Taiwanese, Handed Over to Japanese Consulate by Police</h3>
<p>Hua Guang News Agency reports: Gao Yong'an, a Chinese detective at the Laozha Police Station, recently received a tip that someone had smuggled a large quantity of opium from a certain place and was hiding it in the concession with the intention of selling it gradually. This person would be transporting the opium past the Qinglian Pavilion on Fuzhou Road yesterday morning. Detective Gao reported this to the Western detective chief and went to wait at the appointed time yesterday morning. They arrested a Shandong man named Zhang and seized a large bag of opium from him. They took him to the Laozha Police Station. Under interrogation, the man confessed that he was entrusted to deliver the opium to a certain place. He then led Chinese and Western detectives to Room 337 of the Central Hotel on Hubei Road to arrest the main suspect. When the detectives arrived at the room, three men claiming to be Japanese ruffians came out and interfered, admitting that the opium belonged to them and that the detectives had no right to arrest them. They even resisted arrest. The detectives telegraphed the police station, and a large number of additional detectives arrived and detained the three men. After further interrogation, the three men confessed that they were actually from Taiwan. The police notified the Japanese Consulate and police were sent to transfer the three men for legal proceedings. Zhang will be sent to the First Special District Court this morning for prosecution.</p>

<h3>Japanese Soldiers and Bandits Fight on Former Yidingpan Road, Japanese Military Police Search Residences and Discover Bandit Lair, Gunfire Exchange Rescues Kidnapped Victim Tang Hesheng</h3>
<p>The *Ta Lu Pao* reports that just after 4 AM yesterday (the 4th), a Japanese military police search team exchanged gunfire with a group of bandits near Yidingpan Road and Yuyuan Road in the Shanghai sealed area. The gunfire erupted for a time. According to the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department,</p>
<p>Both Sides Exchanged Fire</p>
<p>As a result, Tang Hesheng, a opium merchant kidnapped on Haig Road on November 28, was rescued. He was taken to the Japanese military police headquarters at 94 Jessfield Road and was subsequently allowed to return home. It is reported that two bandits were injured during the shootout. Whether any other bandits were arrested or any Japanese military police were injured is unknown to the police department. According to detectives at the Jing'an Temple Police Station, the shooting took place in a house next to Yidingpan Road. The area is entirely outside the Public</p>
<p>Concession</p>
<p>Therefore, the police department did not receive an official report about the incident. When the Japanese soldiers and bandits exchanged fire, nearby residents were startled by the sudden gunfire and were greatly frightened. After the news spread, rumors of another assassination circulated in the city. Tang Hesheng was kidnapped at 7:55 AM on November 28 while having tea at a teahouse at 65 Haig Road. The police believed that the bandits aimed to</p>
<p>Extort Ransom</p>
<p>Because Tang was quite wealthy. Until yesterday, a team of Japanese military police searched a house next to Yidingpan Road and discovered it was the bandits' lair. It is said that the bandits fired first, and the Japanese military police returned fire, injuring two bandits and rescuing Tang Hesheng.</p>
<p>Robbery Summary</p>
<p>The Fukang Food Company at 11 Lujia Lane, Lujiawan, French Concession, is owned by Zhang Fukang from Danyang and has been doing well. At approximately 7:45 PM last night, five robbers suddenly arrived. Two were armed with handguns, and three robbers went inside, straight to the accounting room upstairs, while the other two robbers kept watch at the door.

<p>Educational News</p>
<h3>Director Xu of the Education Department Summarizes Zhejiang Province's Education Over the Past Year (Part 1) - Based on Reports from Various Counties and Inspections by Superintendents - Differentiating Items That Should Be Improved and Points to Note</h3>
<p>(Lishui Correspondence) Zhejiang Provincial Education Director Xu Shaodi, based on the educational work reports submitted by each county and the regular guidance reports from the superintendents of this department, has summarized the points to be improved or noted in the educational administration of each county, as follows:</p>
<p>I. Regarding the Organization and Administration of the Education Department:</p>
<p>(1) Whether the county education administrative organization is sound is of great importance to the efficiency of educational administration. If the service personnel of the county education department are not qualified, or the number of personnel is insufficient to cope with the work, or the work is not properly distributed, it will cause significant obstacles during the process. Regarding the number of internal personnel in the education department of each county, (1) the phenomenon of having too few personnel and being unable to cope with the work is common in various counties. Only Yin County and Rui'an County have more than ten people. Only Fenghua, Qu County, Yongjia, Ci County, Dongyang, Yongkang, Jiangshan, Pingyang, and Zhenhai counties have between nine and seven people. The remaining counties, including Xinchang, Huangyan, Tangxi, Longyou, Jiande, Chun'an, Yuhuan, Qing'tian, Longquan, and Xuanping, and the fifteen counties of Sheng County, Ninghai, Wenling, Tiantai, Xianju, Wuyi, Pujiang, Kaihua, Suichang, Suian, Yueqing, Jinyun, Songyang, Yunhe, and Jingning, only have five or four people. The fewest is Dinghai, with only two people. (The above statistics are based on the 43 counties that have submitted reports, excluding Jinhua and Lishui counties, which do not have accurate figures.) According to reports from various counties, the education department often feels that there is not enough manpower, and there are also personnel listed in the education department who are primarily engaged in work that does not belong to the education department. In the future, attention should be paid to (1) the number of personnel should be based on the needs of business development and the number of affiliated institutions, (2) personnel should be full-time, (3) there must be an appropriate distribution of internal work.</p>
<p>(2) In terms of supervision, the relevant department in each county is extremely isolated from the situation of each affiliated school due to the small number of supervisors or insufficient supervision. Each county should have a visit once or twice per semester to ensure that the service personnel of each education institution can work diligently. In the past, due to insufficient supervision, there were cases where schools had been closed for a long time, but the county government was still unaware and continued to issue funds as usual. According to the inspection reports, in addition to the counties under the guerrilla area, Cixi, Dinghai, Xiangshan, Yuyao, Shangyu, Shaoxing, Xiaoshan, Kou County, Xinchang, Ran, Huangyan, Ninghai, Wenling, Tiantai, Xianju, Jinhua, Lanxi, Dongyang, Yiwu, Yongkang, Wu□, Pujiang, Tangxi, Qu County, Longyou, Jiangshan, Changshan, Kaihua, Suichang, Chun'an, Shouchang, Yongjia, Yueqing, Pingyang, Taishun, Jinyun, Songyang, Longquan, Qingyuan, Yi□, and Jingning, a total of forty-two counties, did not submit reports. Examination forms for supervisory personnel were also not submitted by thirty-eight counties to the department. Therefore, it is difficult to understand the actual situation in each county. In the future, when implementing national education, supervision must be strictly enforced. It is hoped that everyone will pay attention to (1) the establishment of supervisory personnel should be directly proportional to the number of affiliated institutions, (2) stipulate the number of visits per semester, (3) supervision reports should be submitted within one month after the end of the semester, (4) examinations for supervisory personnel must be fair.</p>
<h3>Rewarding Teachers and Staff in the City's Primary and Secondary Schools</h3>
<p>Those with more than ten years of service will be compiled and submitted for awards - Applications for free schooling for children attending primary and secondary schools</p>
<p>(Dahua News Agency) In view of the hard work and low income of teachers and staff in the city's primary and secondary schools, the educational sector is deeply concerned. Since the fall of Shanghai, they have struggled arduously and have been able to continue the lifeline of education without interruption, which is commendable. In order to comfort these long-serving teachers and staff and to reduce the burden of their children's education expenses, in addition to submitting a request to the Ministry of Education for commendation, they are also formulating a method for free schooling for the children of teachers and staff in primary and secondary schools, referring to the methods promulgated by the Ministry. All current teachers and staff in public and private registered primary and secondary schools who have continuously served in one school for more than ten years can have their principals provide detailed resumes for compilation and submission for awards. After review and approval by the relevant authorities, they will be forwarded to the Ministry of Education for approval. Children of primary and secondary school teachers who are studying in public primary and secondary schools in this city can also have their principals compile and submit requests for free schooling, which can be implemented after review and approval, it is said.</p>
<h3>Guizhou Provincial Government Restores Middle School Student Loans</h3>
<p>(Guilin Correspondence) The Guizhou Provincial Government has issued a general order to all county governments to restore the loan system for middle school students in each county. The total amount of loans should not exceed 9% of the county's annual education budget. This should be allocated from within the county's overall budget estimates for the 30th year of the Republic, and properly distributed to maximize relief efforts.</p>
<h3>School News</h3>
<p>Dacheng Vocational Tutoring School, known for its low tuition and emphasis on discipline, originally located on Hartung Road, has moved to 310 Sima Road, New Middle School, starting today. Its central location attracts many students who wish to apply for admission.</p>
<p>To commemorate its anniversary, Zhaohe Elementary School held group exercises by various grades starting at 9:00 AM on the 5th. In the afternoon, a parents' meeting and a student achievement exhibition were held. The aged Huang Zhong, known for his archery skills, seemed less impressive. Xu Jingcheng, the "Left Foot King" from Shanghai, suddenly fell ill with a fever of 38 degrees Celsius and was unable to participate. Feng Jingxiang's father was absent at the last minute. As a result, Xu Wenkui and Wu Qixiang from Shanghai were used, with impressive head and foot skills. The entire process was quite thrilling. Hou Chengtuo's kick finally secured the victory, seven minutes after the change of sides.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Governor's Cup Football, Hualian Defeats Western Union, Hou Chengtuo Scores the Decisive Goal</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong News) The preliminary round of the 9th Governor's Cup between Hualian and Western Union was held yesterday at Caroline Hill. The Governor's Cup began in 1932 and has been held for nine sessions until this year. The participating teams are the Western Union team of the Football Association and the Hualian team of the Chinese Sports Association. The best-of-three series. In the past eight sessions, Hualian and Western Union have each won half. Among them, Hualian won the last three sessions from 1937 to 1940. Hualian's strength this year is still strong. However, due to a misunderstanding by the association's selection committee, Li Huitang was not selected to attend. The forward line is short one</p>

<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<h3>The Xu Family's Happy Event</h3>
<p>— Gourmand</p>
<p>It's been a long time since I attended a wedding feast. Firstly, because no one invited me, and secondly, because times are tough. When casual acquaintances have happy occasions, it's best to avoid them. Evading a debt is better than relying on goodwill, so I just pretend not to know. This time, Old Xu is a familiar old neighbor, and he personally invited me, so it seems I have no choice but to give a gift and attend the wedding!</p>
<p>Since I'm giving a gift, I won't do things at a loss. That day, I wore what I thought was a very nice silk robe, new leather shoes, and carefully combed my hair. These were just for show, but my primary purpose was to eat and see. Unlike the women, who treat this kind of dressing up as a huge deal.</p>
<p>When I arrived, the greeter welcomed me inside. After offering my congratulations and accepting tea and cigarettes, my task was done. I sat down comfortably.</p>
<p>The surroundings were filled with harsh voices, drum sounds, and the sound of the erhu. The most eye-catching thing was the huge, bright "囍" (double happiness) character made of neon lights. The congratulatory banners on the walls were inlaid with dazzling gold letters, such as "Made in Heaven," "Talented Couple, Beautiful Flowers, and Full Moon," "Perfect Match!" Seeing these, I couldn't help but think of the meaning of the word "happiness," and my whole body felt melted by the feeling of "happiness." I even forgot about my long-standing regret of not getting a gift certificate. If someone came here and still wore a deadpan expression, it would be completely out of place and impolite. So everyone, without exception, had a big smile on their face. Whether male or female, old or young, being friendly and amiable was never wrong, and this was the most free and equal thing.</p>
<p>The stage performances didn't seem to attract much attention. Only the children were closely surrounding the stage, and some idle passersby were standing and watching the free show. The actors on stage also seemed absent-minded. They were performing mechanically, clearly just going through the motions. They were struggling in a series of endless performances, unable to escape the oppression of their lives. Perhaps they didn't feel any joy or happiness here.</p>
<p>The guests were discussing:</p>
<p>"What's wrong? Why isn't the bride here yet?"</p>
<p>"I heard she went to take photos!"</p>
<p>"It's not taking photos, the bride isn't ready yet!"</p>
<p>"This time I heard the bride is very young, only eighteen years old, but the groom is already almost forty!"</p>
<p>"Hmm! Women really should get married at this time! If they wait too long, no one will want them."</p>
<p>"What kind of talk is that? Does a woman have to rely on marriage to live a good life? Women are also people, and women are no worse than men. Why do women now look down on themselves? As if they were born to be men's accessories! Humph, I don't think so!"</p>
<p>"Look! Isn't that the bride coming?" The debate was interrupted by a sudden shout, and everyone quickly looked outside. Sure enough, a bride in a bright red dress was being pushed in by a crowd of people, with the music playing enthusiastically. People immediately became restless, and children were darting around in the crowd.</p>
<p>"Ah, it's the bride from the Zhao family upstairs!" Everyone was disappointed, but the real joy came soon after.</p>
<p>The hall suddenly became noisy again. This time, the greeter ran in to report, and at the same time, we received a lot of paper flowers and streamers. The stage performers were pushed aside, and everyone craned their necks to look around. The crowd was split into two sections, and some people were standing very tall. The wedding march sounded for the second time, and the noise was drowned out by solemnity.</p>
<p>The groom and best man led the way, followed by the bridesmaid and the bride, walking with unbearably slow steps. "Okay, this is a decision for life," he thought, and she thought the same.</p>
<p>The groom and bride stood still, and several people wrapped colored paper streamers around their necks, tightly wrapping them again and again. Everyone's faces were full of smiles, and the young men and women became even more excited. Their minds were playing tricks on them, and they looked at each other passionately. The girls blushed and lowered their heads, feeling embarrassed.</p>
<p>For the seating arrangement, because I wanted to eat comfortably, I deliberately chose a seat next to a fellow who looked younger than me. I had planned in advance which piece of meat or fish I should pick, and how I should choose the dishes to appear generous and be able to eat a large amount of good food. Everyone sat down, first said "Please," and then the chopsticks went down. At first, there was still some politeness, but later the situation became a bit wrong, it was clearly a scramble. If you were slow, you simply wouldn't get anything to eat. The child next to me unexpectedly turned out to be a fierce eater. He was small, but he ate more fiercely than anyone else. I watched him eat horizontally and vertically, without taking a break. At this point, I realized that the younger generation is truly to be feared.</p>
<p>There was a large, fatty piece of chicken left in the plate. One person reached out with his chopsticks and was just about to grab the chicken when another pair of chopsticks attacked from the side at the same time. The first person embarrassedly withdrew his hand, and the second person also felt a bit awkward, so he reluctantly picked something else. The child next to me seized the opportunity and put the chicken in his mouth. The first person glared at him, but etiquette is just like that!</p>
<p>The female guests stood and waited for us to finish eating. I knew that they were also starving. Some male guests joked with them:</p>
<p>"Do you want to grab a bun to stave off hunger?"</p>
<p>"Bah! We're not hungry ghosts reincarnated, unlike you who haven't eaten in your past life!" The women's mouths were very tough, and everyone laughed again.</p>
<p>In the midst of the seating, a drunkard, made dizzy by the wine, pointed at the female performer singing Shenqu on the stage and said, crying:</p>
<p>"XXX has lost her charm since she got married?"</p>
<p>"Lost her charm? Her man still relies on her fame to make money. Look, she's making forty old dollars for these two hours today!"</p>
<p>A person dressed as an old woman on the stage raised her voice particularly high this time:</p>
<p>"Ah ya? You little girls, it's not easy to be a good wife. Look at so many, you choose well! She pointed her finger at the guests. Everyone felt a tickle in their hearts, and smiles appeared on their faces. Then they heard the girl sing:</p>
<p>"They don't want me!" She blushed and deliberately glanced at everyone.</p>
<p>"I want you! I want you!…" The audience shouted in unison. Everyone wants a bargain, and the pent-up sexual hunger was released at this time.</p>
<p>I headed home with a drunken and happy heart. The night was cold and windy, and everything returned to silence.</p>

<h3>"Unexpected" and "Expected"</h3>
<p>— Zuo Zhuan</p>
<p>The fox praised the crow's singing as beautiful. The crow opened its mouth, and the piece of meat it was holding fell into the fox's mouth. This was certainly somewhat "unexpected." However, the "sadness" that follows "extreme joy" is something that is "expected." Originally, things should not be done to excess. A ball that is pressed down tightly will "bounce up" again. If you lead your enemy to a dangerous cliff, is it possible that he won't turn around and fight you?</p>
<p>Of course, ambitious fantasies are often sweet. Thinking that after "displaying virtue and power," people will "guarantee" that they can be brought under control, not only pleasing them but also satisfying their "desires." Who would have thought that, "unexpectedly," the "guaranteed" things would suddenly "play a different tune!"</p>
<p>Alas! It truly is "unexpected"!</p>
<p>In fact, a real fool is also a bit "cleverly stupid." Moreover, the cleverness of "telling smart people to play dumb" requires even more "effort"!</p>
<p>Therefore, to sum it up, this unexpected thing was actually "expected" all along!</p>
<p>Alas! It truly is "expected"!</p>
<h3>Foreword</h3>
<p>The poem says, "The mirror of Yin is not far off, it is in the Xia Dynasty." History is a truly clear magnifying glass of humanity, and the causes of governance, chaos, prosperity, and decline, as well as the ebb and flow of success and failure, can all be seen within it. Unfortunately, most people are immersed in their environment and neglect themselves, leading to all sorts of repeated mistakes. Thus, viewing the past is like viewing the present, and viewing the present is like viewing the past. The rise and fall of previous dynasties are merely dusty traces, and the changes in the present world only increase the sense of what is to come. As Du Mu said, "Later generations lament them but do not learn from them, which will only cause later generations to lament the later generations." How poignant these two sentences are! When the world was in great chaos and the nation was on the verge of collapse at the end of the Ming Dynasty, in a corner of Jiangnan, people were enjoying the lights of towers and pavilions, the music of pipes and strings, and the stylish scholars and elegant poets, with their carriages and horses, singing and dancing, as if they were deaf and blind to the nation's perilous state and the urgency of foreign aggression. Placing fire on a pile of firewood, they mistakenly believed they were safe, embracing the thought of "let us enjoy ourselves with joy and pass the days in leisure, soon we will die, and others will enter our rooms," seeking immediate pleasures and ignoring future disasters. Even those famous officials and great scholars, who bore the responsibility of governing the country and defending against foreign invaders, and who were supposed to be pillars of the state and shields of the nation, were all indulging in romance, seeking beautiful women, and enjoying themselves in the rivers and lakes in their leisure time. Alas, could this also be the result of the times? It seems that even Heaven knows the situation, and often produces outstanding talent and spirited people from women. One after another, those who fell into the world of entertainment were precisely the most beautiful women with pure hearts, intelligence, passion, and artistry, and were rare treasures of the world. Men were made of mud, and women were made of water. Heroes loved beauty, kings loved beauty, and talented people loved beauty. In general, no one could escape the temptation of beauty, and they were all captivated by the pomegranate skirts. At the same time, many gigolos, actors, and famous performers emerged, vying to please and attract attention, rushing to the scene in droves. As Ban Qiao Miscellaneous Notes said, "Outside the willow shade, in the jade pot, autumn flutes are often played, and spring orioles suddenly sing. Even Song Guangping, with his heart of iron and stone, could not help but write poems about plum blossoms." However, were the hearts of all people in the world completely dead? The most painful were those patriots and people of virtue, women in lacquer rooms, who watched the difficulties of the times with wide eyes and mourned the nation's disasters. In a world where everyone was intoxicated and foreign aggression was rampant, their worries about the nation were of no use, and it was not easy to turn the tide alone. Helplessly, they carried a surge of hot blood and a heart full of ambition, and struggled in a difficult and challenging environment, knowing it was impossible to succeed, but still doing it. They paid no attention to success or failure, gain or loss. Wasn't this earth-shattering and awe-inspiring? On one side, it was like this, and on the other side, it was like that, and they were performing in the heavily fortified suburbs and in the midst of the nation's turmoil. Iron horses, golden swords, green sleeves, and red powder, these are the traces left for later generations, so that those who see them in similar situations, how can they not be saddened by the past and shocked by the present? Truly, "Flowers and plants are empty in the back chamber of the vermilion gate, and the pipa of the green tomb laments the Ming concubine." How could An De get someone like He Fanghui to understand the meaning of the words of the broken-hearted man in Jiangnan? (One)</p>

<h3>About "Sai Jinhua"</h3>
<p>— Liang Hao</p>
<p>We saw Ying Yin's "Sai Jinhua" before we saw her "Empress Dowager Cixi," which she starred in after returning from Chongqing. There have been two scripts describing this Sai Ye, who was respected by ten thousand people, namely Zeng Mengpu's "Flower in the Sea of Sin" and Xiong Fuxi's script. It has already been discussed that "Flower in the Sea of Sin" is not a faithful narration. When Sai Jinhua was about to end her life in a humble alley in Beiping, she replied to an interviewer and expressed her disapproval of "Flower in the Sea of Sin." As for the two scripts, Xia Yan's script used the character of Sai Jinhua to satirize the politics and diplomacy of the time. It was no longer applicable after the War of Resistance, so when the Ju Yi Society decided to perform "Sai Jinhua" at the Xuan Palace, it adopted Xiong Fuxi's script. Xiong Fuxi's script started from the story of the wife reopening the banner, until her death, writing about the life of "a generation of beauties." However, "Ye's making amends through diplomacy" would cause misunderstandings among the audience at this time and place. Wei Ruosheng's adaptation, although he added a Shan'er to affirm Sai Jinhua's "behavior," was still very difficult.</p>
<p>Now the United Company's version also adopts Wei Ruosheng's adaptation of Xiong Fuxi's script. Last month, Wei Ruosheng gave this magazine a letter of correction, saying that he never hoped that "Sai Jinhua" would be made into a movie, although many materials were indeed provided by him. I haven't seen the "Sai Jinhua" movie. According to the setting, there are no "foreigners" appearing in the film, which may also be suitable for the "double" environment at this time and place. However, no matter how hard the editors work to adapt it, "Sai Jinhua is just a play about a generation of beauties." Anyway, Ying Yin's acting skills will not disappoint people.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Cartoon Scene Today</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yizhang</p>
<p>Shanghai is the birthplace of Chinese "cartoons." Over the past ten years, many talented people have emerged. Strictly speaking, the history of cartoons in China is only fifteen years. Before this, there were occasional discoveries, but they were not purely "cartoons."</p>
<p>"In 1926, China began to have cartoons, and Shanghai took the lead in this trend. It flourished in 1931. Two years later, cartoon publications sprang up in Shanghai, and the number of painters increased daily. For a time, "cartoonists" were as numerous as carp crossing the river." The above can be regarded as a brief "History of Chinese Cartoons."</p>
<p>Before the war, Shanghai had a "National Cartoon Comrades' Association," which held several "exhibitions" and "dinners." The number of members was said to be over fifty. This number is not the exact number of Chinese "cartoonists."</p>
<p>After the August 13th Incident, "cartoonists" left Shanghai one after another. Those who stayed behind were mostly bound by "career" or "family." However, most of them "concealed their brilliance" and did not publish their works much. (The writer has also not drawn much in recent years, and even if he does write, it is nothing more than "doing it when he is in the mood." He refuses to write for publications that he is not familiar with. This can be a comfort to those who care about me.)</p>
<p>In the past, Shanghai had several painting institutions, but now, due to the scattering of the responsible persons,</p>
<h3>A Record of Ye Shengzhang's Two Plays</h3>
<p>— Sha Lei</p>
<p>It seems that there are few "precedents" in Shanghai's pear garden for using a martial arts actor to play the main role. Recently, the Fu Liancheng Society came from Pingnan and performed at the Golden Grand Theater. They made an exception by using the martial arts clown Ye Shengzhang as the main attraction, which unexpectedly resulted in excellent results. This is naturally due to Ye Shengzhang's skills.</p>
<p>I have seen two of Ye Shengzhang's plays, one is "Clever Chain" and the other is "Copper Net Formation." In "Clever Chain," Shengzhang plays Gu Shangzao Shiqian. This play is also named "Shiqian Stealing Chicken." The scenes are simple, so all the tumbling skills can be performed with ease. On the whole, Shengzhang's performance is above standard. He is not only agile, but also stable in his agility. It is also rare to be able to be humorous when joking with the shopkeeper without being vulgar. Finally, when eating chicken, there is also a fire-eating performance. Obviously, this is a trick commonly seen in martial arts troupes, but it is rarely seen in Peking opera.</p>
<p>"Copper Net Formation" is taken from the book "Seven Heroes and Five Righteous Men," and tells the story of Bai Yutang exploring Chongxiao Tower alone, which is a wonderful part of "The Cat for the Prince." The first half is almost a play about Bai Yutang Su Furen playing Deng Che (Gao Shenghong playing). Ye Shengzhang only appears in the second half, playing Fan Jiangshu Jiang Ping. The focus of the whole play is the "fishing for the seal" scene. Shengzhang showed all his skills at this time, as agile as a mouse. The shivering when coming out of the water is well described. What makes it successful is that after hearing the news of Bai Yutang's life or death, he sobbed and said: "If you, brother, take a step first, I, as your elder brother, will be heartbroken!" That kind of sad expression makes people realize the sincerity of friendship, which is truly moving. So Ye Shengzhang is not only skilled, but also understands the "Art of Acting." His ability to take on the main role is naturally not accidental.</p>
<h3>China Travel Agency Re-Stages "The Wilderness," The Story of the Protagonist Lin Na</h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>After the China Travel Agency finished performing Hou Yuanqing's "Woman" (originally named "Destruction"), they went on to re-stage "The Wilderness." Sun Jinglu was overworked due to her performances in several consecutive plays, so Miss Lin Na took over as the heroine.</p>
<p>On the first day of the performance of "The Wilderness," the reporter went to watch it and felt that Miss Lin Na's superb and skilled acting skills were unexpectedly satisfactory, and she could be compared with Sun Jinglu. Later, in the backstage of the Xuan Palace, I had a brief interview with Miss Lin Na.</p>
<p>No one would have guessed that she speaks such fluent Mandarin. She is a native of Suzhou. When she was four years old, she moved to Qingdao with her family. There, she spent her junior high school years. After the war broke out, she fled to Shanghai and continued her studies at Shanghai Private Middle School. Because of her love for drama, she often performed for fun.</p>
<p>One time, the Shanghai Drama Society asked her to help out and participate in the performance. Her artistic talent was discovered, and the Shanghai Drama Society invited her to be a basic actor. At this time, she gave up her books and officially entered the drama troupe. At that time, she was in the second year of high school, only one year away from graduating from high school.</p>
<p>When "China Travel Agency" was "revived" in Shanghai under the personal leadership of Director Tang, she was once again invited by Director Tang and joined the ranks of "China Travel Agency." Since the first shot in "Resurrection," Lin Na has been meeting the audience under the banner of "China Travel Agency." Over the years, in the backstage of the "Xuan Palace," she has been regarded as a successful actor, along with Tang Ruoqing, Tang Ruoying, and Sun Jinglu, as one of the four major female actors in the "China Travel Agency."</p>
<h3>Hollywood Movie Star News</h3>
<p>— Sha Wei</p>
<p>Young star Anne Loosbrock's neck often features a unique necklace made of small car registration plates connected together. The numbers on those plates mostly belong to her beloved friends, so naturally, Miguelona's (her closest boyfriend) is among them.</p>
<p>Hedy Lamarr, abandoned by Gene Markey, has now found two new interests, and her future marital issues may be resolved. The names of these two are director Anatole Litvak and the famous American millionaire Landon.</p>
<p>Although Lola Lane has already found a new love interest, she has recently encountered the danger of being dumped, because the sweet and charming new star Lana Turner has become her love rival, creating some bitterness between the two.</p>
<p>Mona Loane, although a female star with many freckles, still looks so charming and moving. This is really due to the right methods; she most avoids using red rouge and often applies a layer of light green makeup to her face. This harmonious color scheme easily covers up her freckles.</p>
<p>There are many studious stars in Hollywood. Whenever they have free time, they find pleasure in books. People like Mervyn LeRoy, Bebe Daniels, and Marlene Dietrich are all famous number one bookworms.</p>
<p>Several electric bells are installed on the gate of Margaret Lindsay's house. The naughty children nearby often ring the bells and play pranks on her. Lindsay thought about it and could not find a solution. Later, she decided to hire an electrician to remove them. The electrician did not ask clearly and removed all the bells on the gate. One night, Margaret came back from filming and could not find the doorbell, so she had to stand outside the door and shout loudly.</p>
<p>The most beautiful female star in Hollywood is probably the elderly June Collyer. Although she is already sixty years old, she must go to the beauty salon for a few hours every Saturday afternoon. No matter if it is windy or rainy, she must go to ensure her peace of mind.</p>
<h3>A Record of Storyteller Kang Wang</h3>
<p>— Lao Shu</p>
<p>Among Yangzhou storytellers, Kang Youhua is famous as the son of Kang Guohua, a master of telling "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," and he truly inherits the family's reputation. Wang Shaotang is popular for telling "Water Margin." Now, these two outstanding talents both perform at the Great China Bookstore, Kang in the daytime and Wang in the evening, evenly dividing the market and each captivating audiences with their storytelling skills. The art of storytelling lies in clear explanations and consistent structure, which should be strictly followed. Interjections are indeed the only embellishment, but they must be placed appropriately. The wording should also be thought-provoking; otherwise, it will feel dull and unpleasant, and inevitably boring. Furthermore, conveying emotions is also an essential element for storytellers. The ability to attract the audience without making them bored is considered a skill. Kang's skill, although comparable to Wang's, allows one to glimpse his ability. Speaking of his strengths: "Water Margin" focuses on social aspects, allowing for more interjections and colloquial word choices; "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" is simpler, and all expressions of emotions should not lean towards pleasing the audience, but must be both refined and popular to be effective. Although both books contain the intention of learning from the past to inspire the present, the difficulty for the storyteller varies. Now, Kang and Wang working together possess the magic of appealing to both refined and popular tastes, which may well add a new page to the Shanghai storytelling scene.</p>
