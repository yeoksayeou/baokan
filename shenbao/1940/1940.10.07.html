<p>社評</p>
<h3>近衛談話與美國</h3>
<p>無論那一國，無論平時戰時，總是把爭取與國當做一椿大事；然而與國的獲得有時固無異於國力的增强或威脅的解除，有時却會因此而投身冒險深淵，招致重大後果。有如去年蘇德之成立不侵協定，顯係屬於前者的例證；而日本此度締結三國盟的，根據旬日來的國際反應來看，則無疑正是走上後一個不幸的途徑。</p>
<p>關於三國盟的及其影響，本報連日論之已詳，其中有一點應該特別注意的，便是德義是由此一同盟獲得了實利，日本則從然加重了負担。因爲締盟的主要目的既在牽制美國，則在目前國際形勢之下，這是德義借重日本來遂行，而日本並不能從德義方面得到任何實際援助。日本在多年外交孤立之餘，驟即獲得兩個炙手可熱的新興强國爲與邦，在精神上也許差堪自慰；但其所必須付出的代價之巨，竟至適等於整個國運的前途。已首相近衛於二三日前發表時兩度談話、已明顯表示着此一同盟的締結，有釀成美日戰爭的可能。其實近衛談話的內容，不過是五月廿九日日外相有田所發表東亞門羅主義宣言的重述；所不同的，只是彼時沒有人與日本聲應氣求，故其態度委婉而較和緩，此際近衛則適在獲得德義同盟之後，故不惜逕以愬之戰爭相威嚇。即此已可見日本縱未從三國同盟獲得若干實利，却更增加了虛矯之氣，並沉溺於新的冒險幻夢當中。在近衛談話中，除卻示威而外，也還有利誘的別一面；除却排擊而外，，也還有示好的別一面。所謂利誘，那便是企圖以承認美國在西半球的領導地位爲美國承認亞歐「新秩序一的交換條件。在三國盟的原文中，對於美洲情勢並無隻字提及，顯亦屬故意留此空隙，以備敷衍美國之需。這適足與前此德國所表示美國如不干涉歐洲事務，美洲門羅主義始能有效之說相呼應，回溯今年七月初旬，羅斯福總統曾授權歐萊秘書發表關於門羅主義的談話，所謂交換條件之說，也許便是由那一談話所引起的幻想。其實，即便置美方一切實際措施於不問，單從歐萊談話本身尋繹，亦足證明美國所意想的門羅主義顯與所謂亞歐「新秩序」者絕無絲毫相同的地力。美國旣無侵略野心，更根本不想對同洲任何大小國家加以侵佔或奴役；則近衛所謂相互承認其領導地位者，在日本固可藉以確立其獨占遠東的霸權、在美國殆無任何意義可言。國際局勢已經演變到目前程度，而猶提出此種膚淺建議，這不是故意忽視美國根本立塲，便是對美方堅定政策假作痴聾。據五日合衆社的東京消息：近衛談話發表後，日本輿論界頗少劍拔弩張的氣象；反之一般却又希望美國能對日本政策予以諒解，可見那種鹵莽滅裂的戰爭呼聲，並不受日本民間的擁護；但美日間的諒解之絕不能在三國同盟或「東亞新秩序」的基礎上獲得，這不是日方假作痴聾所得了事的。</p>
<p>日本現在之所以對付美國者，顯然還是前此對英的同樣策略；但已往英國縱曾幾度動搖，其最後演變的結局卻證明了苟安觀念與綏靖政策都已經在遠東碰壁。至於美國、如果在一年以前遭遇挑戰的威脅，也許會使孤立派大爲鴟張，使美當局的遠東政策受到牽掣；然而最近種種敎訓太深刻了，任何人都覺悟了這一國際危機絕非怯懦　閃躲所能為力。在竭力擴張軍備並進行兩洋聯防之餘，美海長諾克斯前日更明白表示美國如遇挑戰，則美國海陸軍將於公海和戰塲上應付之，這一表示足以代表美國答復三國同盟以及由三國同盟所引起種種事態的根本態度。</p>
<p>戰爭的天才理論家克羅塞維茨說過：『戰爭與其說在侵略者方面，無寗說在防禦者方面。因為有了侵略，纔引起抵抗，有了抵抗，戰爭纔成立。侵略者總是愛好和平的，他希望不流血而侵入我國。然而他終於不能不準備流血者，那是因為我們要戰爭，他纔不得不作戰爭的準備』。詞也不再像若干時候以前之足以嚇人。現在防禦者方面已經有了充分決心和準備，但侵略者的戰爭準備之是否能與其慾望相符合，却還是個絕大疑問。</p>
<p>示威與利誘是對於美國一國雙管齊下的兩面、而其所得的答案皆屬吾定、有如上述。至於排擊與示好、則對象不祗一國，其意義容再析論。</p>
<h3>新華日報論　日美衝突</h3>
<p>重慶新華日報頃認最近日首相及外相之言論、僅屬一種恫嚇、其目的在使羅總統於未來選舉遭受失敗。該報稱。「日美之糾紛、已非由戰爭解決不可、然此兩國目下均尙未有完全之準備、故吾人相信東京之言論、僅係一種恫嚇、美國之選舉期業已迫近、羅總統顯然已獲得美國實業階級之擁護、羅斯福本人、係反對軸心國各組織之主角、日本因利用美國實業階級之畏戰心理、故爲恫嚇之詞、藉使實業階級因此放棄其對羅斯福之擁護、是卽近衛松岡向美挑戰之真正目的、（六</p>

<h3>歐美的間諜恐慌</h3>
<p>馮耶勒上校及其兒子雷納與日內瓦出版商莫錫爾的被捕，證明瑞士境內也有德國便衣隊的活動存在。馮耶勒上校是瑞士國社主義派國民陣綫的領袖，現仍關在瑞士京城的監獄裏。</p>
<p>至於莫錫爾則代德國在法國搜集情報。莫鍚爾利用他的通信員在法國自由採訪，把情報供給馮耶勒上校。沮利克附近通往德國的國際公路，很少有人監視，沮利克因而成爲一個轉遞情報的理想站。</p>
<p>德方間諜活動的總部則設在瑞士京城，那地方，正像一九一四年至一九一八年一樣，是各國外交家，中立國人，交戰國人聚會之處。這一個小山環繞的京城，全歐洲的間諜都在活動着，以「特派參贊」名義出現的人物，也從來沒有像目前這樣多。其中有一個經常光顧的遊客名叫尼古萊將軍，他在沮利克租賃一所長住的別墅。他是卸仟的德國情報主任，據說與希特勒政見不合。他的專門任務却在與法國共產黨人保持接觸，鼓動他們發動和平運動，陷英國於孤立無援的絕境。</p>
<p>瑞士陸軍總司令吉珊會雷士，也是國民陣綫的領袖。第二個著名人物是軍法官脫魯伯上校。瑞士各大學中，德國留學生也已勒令退學。</p>
<p>南斯拉夫也在勞力防止國社黨及法西黨旅行家的大批入境，允其在首都貝爾格拉及柴格拉勃兩地，這些旅行家都以參觀貝爾格拉博覽會名義，公開地來到南斯拉夫。現已有大批旅行家被南斯拉夫當局限期出境。貝爾格拉眾政長官已設立專局，飭令本國居民向該部報吿行動可疑之人。然而南斯拉夫許多要人都有嫌疑，譬如南斯拉夫冲齡幼君的一舉一動，雖只有警察知道，但不久都流傳出去了。從這點可以看出有人擬綁架南斯拉夫國王彼得，然後再使其復位，成一個傀儡了。</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞最爲國社黨所注意。巴爾幹半島各地，有成千累萬的人，名義上是商人，參贊及新聞記者，實際上却以全部時間。或抽出一部分時間做間諜工作。南斯拉夫冲齡幼君有被綁架的危險，羅馬尼亞新君米契爾也有同樣不利的情形。羅馬尼亞當局曾按戶搜查，勒令有嫌疑的人出境，但仍有幾萬德國人潛居羅馬尼亞境內，並且這些人據外界所知，都有武器，其中有好多人且曾拒絕警察搜查。所不可知者，羅馬尼亞警察究吾嚴格執行任務，抑僅口頭說說罷了。</p>
<p>巴爾幹最近發生一件極可注意的事，就是有好幾百個德國靑年工人，由多瑙　乘着汽船，開到保加利亞國境。這一批靑年工人的任務，據他們自己宣稱，是在利用假期，獲得休息機會。但據記者所得情報，這些工人係由三十艘船分載，每决二百人，分批集中保加利亞境內。</p>
<p>土耳其防制間諜的辦法，比之他國，較爲周密。間諜在土耳其活動的機會因比別國爲少。伊斯坦埠爲土耳其全境最危險的地方，當局會在德國僑民中問搜索出大批間諜。最近則伊斯坦埠活動的有一百六十個外國咖啡館的音樂師，其中有一百零七個是匈牙利方面前來的演技女子。</p>
<p>埃及間課內幕稍與他國情形不同。在去年九月大戰剛爆發時，埃及境內所有德國人都被監禁。但共中大部分隨後卽被釋放，同時還有許多德國人，名爲國社黨驅逐出境的難民，也被埃及當局允許入境。然而埃及境內比德國便衣隊更危險的，乃是法西黨間諜所指揮的七萬有組織而同時受領事保護的義大利僑民。在義大利參戰以前，這些大批法西黨徒早已派定了各人所擔負的任務。埃及當局內此非常恐懼道批人進行內部搗亂工作。</p>
<p>法國前總理達拉第下令抄查巴黎蘇聯貿易局，發現德國秘密警察所擬暗示錄，因而獲悉法國境內間諜，爲害極爲危殆。巴黎該决大搜查曾抄獲各種間諜活動情形，其中國社黨間諜，法西黨間諜，蘇聯間諜，無不應有盡有。據達拉第報告，法國的「自由主義」及「自大主義」，對於外僑向來過於放縱，各國的間諜因得爲所欲爲。</p>
<p>法國咖啡館中肆無忌憚的高談闊論，對於留心探聽情報者，所獲極多，這此情報類皆取道羅馬的路綫，轉　柏林。巴黎時報前任本埠新聞編輯亞洛奧賓之被收買，可見德外長李本特洛甫的心腹間諜阿貝茲已將巴黎重要人物，都收羅在股掌之間。這一批德國間諜係以愛南姆男爵夫人爲領袖，她生得很漂亮，且能操多數國方言，在巴黎專事中持親德影片和報紙，以及覓取傳遞軍事情報。法國對於間諜，自戰爭一開始，卽嚴密防範。巴黎下層社會曾一度眾行大搜查，被捕的有幾千人之多。</p>
<p>法國軍車區域是與外界隔絕的。在軍事區內的人，不得與外界通電話電報，或寄書信，一切行動也受監視。但軍事區域內自然也有間諜。不過據法國當局的推斷，這些間諜如其無法把情報通過警戒綫，他們就不足爲患了。後來，法國又曾在巴黎將所有德國男子及十六歲至六十五歲間未出嫁的德國女人，加以圈禁。法國內政部長一職，也由已故「老虎總理」克萊蒙梭的親信芒台爾調任，足以證明法國對於撲滅便衣隊確曾抱有最大決心。不過巴黎近郊住有無數外人，肅淸間諜工作非常棘手。其中最大的困難就是非交戰國僑民，仍得繼續享受各項自由，始終沒有受法國當局絲毫的的束。</p>

<h3>推廣中國股票之重要及其方策</h3>
<p>— 王海波</p>
<p>中國股票及其市塲</p>
<p>所謂股票，爲股份有限公司或股份兩合公司有限責任部份股東對於公司投資所有權之一種憑證。買賣股票，卽爲此項投資所有權之讓渡。中國股票之發軔，始於第一决歐洲大戰時。迄至今日，華商之發行股票者有金融業，烟草業，火柴業，印刷書紙業，保險業，百貨業，礦務業，新藥業，搪瓷業，以及公用事業，化學工業等，卽上海一埠，其中較著名者，已不下一百種之多。民國三年，目成立上海股票商業公會，會所設於九江路禾興坊。加入之同業初爲十二家，繼增至十五家；上市買賣者有中國，交通，通商等銀行，招商局，漢冶萍，漢口旣濟水電，粵漢鐵路等公司股票。其後華商證券交易所及上海證券物品交易所，均開做股票買賣。二十六年六月，證券物品交易所將證券部份歸併華商證券後，中國之股票市塲，乃僅華商證劵一家。且考之實際，華商股票先後發行者，雖有數百餘種之多。然其公開買賣與流通市向者，實　寥寥。而華商證券交易所之交易主體，又爲利息優厚之政府證劵；股票交易，實不能等量齋觀。八一三後，華商證券交易所奉令停業，因之華商股票之命運，更不如前。反顧外商股票，投機在熱，前所未聞；致召資金之外流，復引金融市塲震盪之禍，良可惜也。際此游資充斥，盲從篇害之日，民族股票市塲之重建，豈非急要之圖歟？</p>
<p>華商股票不發達之原因</p>
<p>華商股票交易之冷落，究爲何故？作者熟思再三，實有不能已於言者：</p>
<p>（一）曰一般條件之不良　如中國經濟落後，產業未與，公司組織，未臻發達。各公司雖有股票發行，然以大多數公司，資本額有限，發行股票，不够流通，此其一。西安事變前，國內政治，阮隉不寗；社會一般情形，又時生變動；影饗所及，工商業自不易得正常之發展，華商股票之發行與流通，自亦受其拘束，此其二。八一三戰起，中國產業，直接間接之飽受摧殘，迄今情况不明者，在在皆是。凡在此種種不良條件，均爲華商股票不易發達之原因。</p>
<p>（二）曰公司本身之弱點　中國公司組織　素不健全，弱點叢生，實爲不可吾認之事實。其最機著者，约有下列五端：（一）公司眞實情况，不肯公開；對於探聽該公司消息者，更故意爲難，使投資者望而生畏，（二）就常理言之，投資者在未投資以前，必先分析破投資公司之資產負債表與損益計算書，以明該公司之財政狀况與營業狀况，以便與其他同種企業具他公司相比較，藉明該公司在該企業組織中之地位，以決定其投資方針。但在中國，大多數公司，雖具新企業之名，然對於足以表示該公司之財政與營業狀况之會計紀錄，大都秘而不宣；偶有宣布者，又略而不詳；甚至係未必最可靠之數字。（三）華商股票，咸爲大股東所執有；流通於市面者爲數無多。股息優厚者，固不欲岌岌出售；股息微薄者，則難於出售。（四）股東執有之股票，轉讓時常生困難；據作者所悉：嘗有某股東出賣其執有之某種股票，其他關係股東開之，大驚失色，竟欲召集股東大會以謀對付。投資者覩此現象，勢必躊躇不前矣。（五）股東成交後，欲行過戶，公司方面，或因格於章則，或係故意爲難，手續至爲煩多。卽倖能打破此種難關，但如中，交銀行，先施公司等股票之過戶，又遠在重慶與香港各處，往返需時。且在未實行過戶前，投資者仍有負投資危險之可能性。外股過戶迅速簡單，實爲中國股票所不及。</p>
<p>（三）曰投資者之顧忌　國人對中國股票投資之顧忌，可分數方面言之：如對於發行股票公司之最近財政狀况與營業狀况不能洞悉其詳，近數年來該公司發息之情形，亦無確實之報吿；投資者自不敢冒然購進，一也。華商股票多爲記名式，轉讓時必須過戶；且過戶手續，多數麻煩而遲緩；若稍有不合，且須辦理登報具保等項手續；此項手被，有時固爲愼重計，有時在事實上則非必要；而中國公司大都依例行之，遂使投資者對於股票交易，表示畏憚；二也。此種情形，半由一般社會條件之不良，半由公司本身有多種弱點之存在。而我國之無健全的公開買賣股票市塲，更爲投資者所大忌。</p>
<p>夷考歐美各國所調固定資金證券化者，卽以固定投資之證券，得藉交易所買賣流通；投資者以此項證券富有轉讓性，不亞於短期投資，故咸樂於承受。惟在中國，金融市塲條件，尚未健全；正絲之買賣股票市塲，更感缺乏。遂使持有股票者，無由賣出；欲向金融業抵押，多被拒絕。似此賣旣不能，押又不可，股票持有者在此兩大爲難之中，實不免起股票無益之歎！此就股票供給方面情况言之。至若需要方面，則又有問津無從之苦。以此供求不能相濟，持有股票者，因不能濟其缺乏資金時之窮，如執無價値之物；而投資者或則欲購無從，旣購父恐慮資金呆定；對於華商股票之投資，於是畏縮不前；遂使社會游資，轉向於外匯·黄金·外商股票等投機之途；資金外流，不可遏止；市塲被擾，爲禍尤烈；斯誰之過歟？謂與中國無公開買賣之證券市塲無關，其誰能信？</p>
<p>今後應有之對策</p>
<p>證劵市塲與金融市塲　係，至爲密切；具有命融常識者，均能知之。蓋證券市塲，爲執行證劵買賣，及控制證券市塲之唯一塲所；而證券買賣之靈滯，與證券市價之漲洛，在在與金融市塲有關。而公債市塲與股票市塲，又爲證券市塲形成之兩大柱石也。今以中國股票交易之不發達旣如此，而中國股票市塲之需要又如此；建立中國股票市塲之重要，固不待言。然則在今日中國之局面下，將何由以建立者乎？此與導引游資，發展正當工商業，實具密切之關係，吾人不能不籌思考慮。茲以菅見所及，分陳五點如下：</p>
<p>（一）屬於一般者　就目前一般情形言：國外局勢，日趨緊張，國內各種產業，在此不景氣氛圍中，多呈緊縮之狀態。投資股票，雖難保證其絕對有利可圖；然吾人稍可自慰者，在目前困難環境中，許多產業，仍形發達；事在人爲，投資之能吾得利？多基乎產業之本身；投資者如具有敏銳之眼光，投資中國股票，實不靴操左券。在此吾人提倡中國股票聲中，希望投資家能捐除成見，中國產業並非不足與有爲也。</p>
<p>（二）公司本身　中國股票交易之不發達，原於公司本身之不健全者多，前已論及。今後公司本身應改良者，有下列數點：（一）健全內部組織，如整理人事陣容，擴充股　，卽爲其中之著者。現今一般投資者，對於被投資公司之人事陣容，尙少注意；然投資原理研究有素者，對於人事陣容不甚完整之公司組織，不願率爾投資。父我國大多數公司組織，資本甚微；所發之股票，除爲少數股東執有外，甚少流通於市而；故此項組織，似可淮謀擴充，歡迎社會人士參與其間，以期羣策羣力。（二）會計紀錄，至關重要；公司方面如求外界之信任，更爲求該公司股票之推行，則對於會計及每年之營業情形，似宜公開發表，使外界得悉其眞實狀况。他如股票過戶，須力求迅速簡單；凡非必要之手續，可以從略。要之：公司本身，貴在調整得宜；優點力求保存，並進而發揚光大；缺點則力求改良，以期盡美盡善。此匪僅有關外界　資，發展公司之本身，亦應如是。</p>
<p>（三）投資家　丁此時局，投資者亦宜猛省與澈底之覺悟。年來國人投機於外滙黃金與外商股票者，發財者固不乏人，因之傾家蕩產，涉訟囹圄者，亦已屢見不鮮。如今年六月初，歐洲局勢加緊，英國股票在落，外滙回鬆，上海外商銀行　生提存，投機心理向下，益以荷屬東印度局勢緊張等等，外股價格，一瀉萬里，其中因投機外商股票而吿失敗者，誠不知幾許人。可知投資於外商股票，旣非絕對安全，更非絕對有利。投資家今應覺悟與猛省者一。値茲國際局勢，震盪靡定，外商各公司之動靜，時有變更；來日情况，殊難逆料；民初橡皮股票風潮。餘悸尙在。如投資中國股票，究可就近探悉該公司之實情，監督目亦較易。此投資家所宜猛省與覺悟者二，且也，投資外股，實昧於國民資任；對於華商股票，反視若無覩；亦足令人寒心。殊不知中國產業，有待於國人振興；投資於中國股票，又豈僅有助於中國工商業發展之一端而已。傳云：皮之不存，毛將安附？吾人甚望國內投資家體味斯霄，有所覺悟，而幡然改圖！</p>
<p>（四）金融界　證券與金融息息相關，則提倡中國股票，有賴於金融界；而金融界中之信託業，允難辭其職責。按信託業中：有信託投資；有代理有價證券之渦戶登錄；有辦理公司設立及發行公司債信託諸業務。凡此種種，皆與正當之資本市塲，脈脈相關。然今日我國資本市塲之情况若何，吾人不忍卒言。故提倡推廣中國股票，不徒足以創造資本市塲，信託業本身業務亦得賴以發展。唯在吾信託業能吾起而實行之耳？</p>
<p>（五）輿論界　當茲提倡中國股票聲中，輿論界與各業領袖，實負有重要之責任。輿論界應將中國公司之內幕情形，多多介紹；各界領袖，允宜多投資於中國產業，以爲倡導。一經有力者提倡，則投資者將必接踵而至；其有助於中國資本市塲與民族產業之前途，豈淺鮮耶？</p>
<p>現今上海，一切均在畸形發展之中；表現於金融市塲者：一方面數十萬萬游資充斥於投機之途；另方面關係國運之正當產業，則因缺乏資金，無由發展。此兩者間之鴻溝愈深，則其爲禍於社會者益大。推廣中國股票，卽　方面導游資於坦途，另方面謀中國工商業</p>
<p>邁進；且使兩者相互爲用，相得益彰，　　　會無窮之福也。（一九四〇，十，五，於環球信託公司）</p>

<h3>論近日公債之上漲</h3>
<p>— 蕭觀耀</p>
<p>我國金融市塲之有公債買賣，已一十餘年；目「上海股票商業公會」成立，遂有會員之正式集會，經營公債；迨華商證券交易所開慕，上海一躍而爲證券市塲之中心。</p>
<p>滬戰發生，上海各交易所均經政府明令停止營業，公債市塲，卽見偃旗　鼓，迄今猶未明令復業。</p>
<p>然戰事內移以後，上海在特殊環境之下，公債買賣之喧囂聲，又在證券交易所聞矣。惟此種交易已非曩日萬頭鑽動之公開市塲可比，而爲一「茗談處」。而此「茗談處」，不久竟亦如公開市塲，成爲投機者之淵藪。</p>
<p>然則公債何爲而成投機者之對象，此中因素甚多，茲擇其犖犖大者，分析如後：</p>
<p>第一，吾人試閱戰前之公債價格，統甲最高爲八八·二〇元，最低爲七六·六〇元，統乙最高爲八六·六〇元，最低爲七六·六〇元，統丙最高爲八四·八〇元，最低爲七四·六〇元，統丁最高爲八三·三〇元，最低爲七四·〇〇元，統戊最高爲七三·四〇元，最低爲七一·七〇元，此爲民國二十六年六月份之紀錄，及至二十七年一月，中日戰事已經發生，其價格已低至極點，如統甲最低價爲四二·五〇元，統乙爲四〇·二〇元，統丙爲三九·八〇元，統丁爲三九·〇〇元，統戊爲三九·〇〇元，而中國抗戰瞬入第四年，勝利之信心日濃，目前之價格尙低，趁賤吸收，不僅爲銀行準備上着想，爲一極佳之時期，而投機者亦於此時期中，公債籌碼之需要遠超供給，價格遂上漲無已。</p>
<p>第二，今日公債之巨額買賣，係用匯劃，匯劃不似戰前之隔日取現，現須貼水，如以法幣換匯劃再購公債，頗屬便宜，蓋者人可目見戰事結束以後，匯劃貼水之風，可以戢跡。</p>
<p>第三，上海游資充斥，日益顯著，三年以還，上海巨商殷富，在外匯緊縮上，在外股活動上，在棉紗日用品之囤積上，已飽獲國難財，最近興起對公債之念頭，良以公債暗市買賣，冷淡已久，國際環境及抗戰形勢，似於公債前途有利，况巨商殷富，已在各項投機上撈獲一批油水，經濟上不無相當基礎，今日不妨改換口味，投資公債，復可博得信仰國債之美名，何樂而不爲乎？</p>
<p>第四，鑒於公債前途之樂觀，旣爲公債上漲原因之一，且公債可坐收一分以上之利息，比較銀行存息爲優，蓋以近日銀行以上海游資過剩，有减息之舉，故不若趁公債尙低時加碼第五，公債旣在各方加碼中價格上漲，則般借碼拋空者，不得不爲之色變，紛起補空，公債價格，更扶搖直上。</p>
<p>第六，且以最近越南緊張，表示日本南進愈切，其與英美在太平洋之衝突，可能性愈屬接近，中蘇美之會議，以穩定遠東之時局傳說，甚囂塵上，故越南雖緊張，而公債之上漲程度，並不因而减退。</p>
<p>第七，美國允貸款中國維持外匯二千五百萬美元，已由美國建設銀公司主任瓊斯說明，官方予以證實　此於國際救支上大有利助。且因貸款成功，反映中國財政信用之健實，國際地位之良好，戰事前途，益爲有利。故人心振奮，市塲安定，使公債暗市統一各債堅定轉漲，更無疑慮。</p>
<p>職是之故，母謂最近公債如統甲最高達六五·五五元，統乙達五九·〇〇元，統丙達五六·九五元，統丁達五五·一〇元，統戊達五六·三三元。（九月十日之行市）已迭成戰後之新高峯，非無故也。</p>
<p>吾人觀乎近日公債之上漲，其於吾國玫治，軍事，經濟，財政上之反映爲如何，更可以思知半矣。</p>
<h3>我國占時財政</h3>
<p>— 兪燮麟</p>
<p>抗戰迄今，已逾三載，難抗戰建國，同時並進，需用異常浩繁，但仍能應付裕如，財政依然穩固。此豈非我國財政改造為何。孔財長在七七紀念日發表之一抗戰三年來之財政與金融二文中云：「以言租稅，則抗戰三年，雖歷有改進，而一般人民負擔，並未加重；以言公債，則發行未嘗逾量，而債信仍能維持；以言法幣，則準備充實，信用雯堅定如常。」其所以能如此者，其主要原因有五：（一）戰前已有相然之佈置；（二）戰時之措置適宜；（三）我國為農立國，經濟基礎在於農村，三年以來，連　豐收，於民有莫大之利；（四）國內外同胞踴躍輸將；（五）友邦之同情援助。基此種種原因，所以我國之戰時財政能應付裕如。</p>
<p>三年以來，財政制度頗有改進，俾我財政漸趨於合理化，目將數年來決而未行之政策，亦能於此短時期內付諸實施。作者乃將三年來財政當局所實施之政策，作一簡略之檢討。</p>
<p>戰前財政之改革</p>
<p>當啟戰之時，我國財政，能安定應付，出乎衆望之外，此當歸功於戰前之準備。</p>
<p>（一）財政統一，在戰前已有相當之進步。當局對於財務行政權之統一改進，已有顯著之成就。故戰事發生，財政當局卽能應付。</p>
<p>（二）廢除苛雜，以培養民力。過去我國之地方稅制，紊亂已極，苛捐雜稅，名目繁多，且任意勒索，以圖私利，病國書民，莫此為甚。故當局在第二次全國財政會議後，卽積極推行發除苛雜，數年之間，成績顯著，如此一方面解除人民之負担，另一方面培植地方之富力，使國民經濟，日趨繁榮。</p>
<p>（三）舉辦新稅，以適合戰時之需要。我國租稅，以關鹽統三稅爲主，但此項間接稅，均偏於沿海名省，一旦失隱，稅收卽將無着。當局有見於此，乃舉辦所得稅。所以得稅在戰時可以繼續加徵，以支付戰時之所需，且人民亦不以加徵為怨，因負担公平也。</p>
<p>（四）整理公債，恢復國家信用。至於內債，名目繁多，利率參差，期限短促，使我國財政負担加重，我國預算因而難望平衡。於是二十五年初，加以澈底整理，將三十餘種分立之內債，歸併五種統一公債，將期限延長，利率統一，財政上每年因而可减輕鉅額之負祖。至於外債，亦積極整理。是故在戰前數月，內外各債之市價，均達滿意之水準。</p>
<p>（五）改革通貨，以統一全國之幣制。通貨改革成功，實爲我國財政當局最偉大之成就。法幣制度實行，可使發行集中，銀行增强，金融安定，更可促成國家預算之平衡。（未完）</p>
<p>商業新聞</p>
<h3>金融述評</h3>
<p>— 聖凱瓊</p>
<p>—十月五日—</p>
<p>據日方同盟社消息，美商銀行將對公衆拒售美滙，雖然不顯明的指日商，但據金融界的觀察，則心目中必有所針對而言，因其發生恰在德義日三國締結軍事經濟同盟之後。按美商銀行所限制並未現貨，而爲遠期，至於此項限制，亦非專對日商而設施，事實上常是普遍的。而且這種限制更非美商銀行所採取的單獨行動，而是其他銀行所共同採取的行動</p>
<p>這次期滙交易的限制，雖非是對日本，而其起因，實在由於日本外交政策的變史。上海的外商銀行因爲日本與德義訂定三國盟的，深恐日本牽入歐戰漩渦的結果，使日商銀行的上海分行，無法履行對其他外商銀行的契的義務，而遭受損失，所以爲預防起見，凡與日商銀行有往來的外商銀行，對日商銀行拋售的十月份期滙想在最近能交割了結，依照上海外滙市塲慣例，十月期貨交易原可延至十月底了結，但目前國際局勢日見轉變，不同國藉的銀行間底交易，日見危險，則對日商銀行所拋售的十月份外滙，當然以能在最短期內交割爲佳。</p>
<p>因爲此項限制完全爲預防國際上局勢變化而蒙不利，故同一國藉的銀行間期貨交易，或同一立塲的銀行間期貨交易，當然仍可照常進行無阻，所以上海外滙市塲不受影饗。不過有此一項限制之後，將來市塲上並非源於商業上的需要的期滙交易，而爲投機性的賣買，多少耍得受束縛，這對於投機者是然不利的，而對外滙市塲則是解除了一些搗亂的暴力，變爲有利的了。　（完）</p>
<h3>活期减息後　大家改存定期　鞏固游資良策</h3>
<p>本市各商業銀行、自十月一日起實行减低活期儲蓄及柱來存款利率一厘、卽原爲四厘者、改爲三厘、查减息一事、戰專發生後、各行因大部定期存款、均改存活期、資金運用困難、早有此項擬議、近因香港等處游資流入甚鉅、各行活存日增、同時銀行準備會之交換存款與同業存款每日平均金額合計、自二十八年八月份三千九百十五萬四千八百四十九元七角四分、至今年七月份增爲一萬一千一百〇九萬四千一百四十元〇三角六分、八月份　增至一萬五千四百四十二萬七千六百五十　元八角七分、開該會存款之新紀錄，僅以該會而論。去年八月份與今年八月份相較、計增一萬一千五百二十七萬二千八百〇二元一角三分之鉅、故各行减低活息、由擬議而卽決定於十月一日提前實行、但實行之前、各行因寄發通知减息信件給存戶、大部趕辦夜工、將信於十月一日前發出、而銀行算給存戶之息、仍以十二月　十日爲給息之期、惟其中利率、自六月二十一日至九月三十日爲一期、十月一日至十二月二十日止又爲一期、（按减息計算）、此次銀行實行减低活期利率、實開銀行業　前所未有之先例、但自實行减低活期利率後、一般存戶因活存减息、　月一日以後、由活期改存定期者頗多、故此次活存减息、使銀行與存戶均能得益、在銀行方面、因活期改定期、可以提一部份資金運用、因以前活存太多、不敢運用、若一旦謠言發生、活期大家均需立刻全部提取故也、而存戶方面、因活期减息、改存定期、反可得較大之利息、故减低活息、實可稱移游資爲固定、又可抑制投機之技倆也、（玉）</p>

<h3>確立遠東政策　美舉鉅款卽為事實答復　日虛聲恫嚇於局勢無補　伍德海推闡近衛言論之後果</h3>
<p>英籍著名評論家伍德海昨在英文大美晚報發表評論云、日本首相近衛在京都接見新聞記者時所發之聲明、如果眞的代表其最後之言、則美日間之戰爭、必須認爲無法避免矣、近衛之言爲太平洋之戰爭或和平、繫於日美雙方尊重其在東半球與西半球彼此利益之程度、美國必須表示對於日本在東方地位之適當諒解與同情、以此爲合作之先決條件、如美國仍拒不爲之、而視三國盟的爲敵對行爲、則唯有戰爭而已、近衛又稱、日本將誘使蘇聯英國與美國終止援助重慶、</p>
<p>美日合作決不可能</p>
<p>查自日本宣布其建設一東亞新秩序」及擴而至於「大東亞」之計劃後、美國之態度、早已有所表示、因美國明白此種「新秩序」之用意、故完全不予同情、非但不承認、且將竭其力之所能、繼續阻止日本此種計劃之完成、各種恫嚇、無論來自日本或任何其他方面、均無法望其能轉變美國之遠東政策、而使其承認日本之「新秩序、」而與之合作建設、當近衛言及「合作之先決條件」時、其所指者正與美國之政策背道而馳、故此種合作、決無實現之可能、</p>
<p>美國政策不受恫嚇</p>
<p>美國對日本最初有限之「東亞新秩序」計劃、卽以取消美日商的、作爲反對之具體表示、而近來日本野心更大之「大東亞新秩序」計劃發表後、繼之而起者、卽爲美國第一次嚴重之報復行動、近衛及其同僚等若果信爲東京（或柏林或羅馬）之虛聲恫嚇、卽足以轉變美國之基本政策、則彼等之孤陋寡聞、亦復可憐、蓋羅斯福政府或任何其他美國總統之政府、決不採取大多數美國人所認爲不忠於中國或不忠於民主國家之政策也、</p>
<p>貸華鉅款事實在先</p>
<p>當前之一切證據、指明美國國內人民與官方、已一致決意不與日本對於其目下之東亞政策共同合作、至於日本欲思誘使其他國家、包括美國在內「終止援助重慶」、此項企圖、已由數日前對中國之二千五百萬元美金貸款預先答覆之、聰明之政治家如近衛者、豈眞以爲日本之抗議、卽足以取消美國所定援華之保證乎、</p>
<p>日對蘇聯未敢指摘</p>
<p>過去據　英美有援助重慶之行動、遂被作爲非難之對象、但對於蘇俄之援助中國、則殊無所聞、此中確有重要之意義、查蘇俄援華、從未問斷、甚至在滇越鐵路及滇緬公路被封鎖以後、亦繼續如故、且其所包括軍備之範圍、更大於英美兩國之接濟、數日前、日本有不反對蘇聯援華之聲明、此誠爲有趣之解釋、其實日本雖能利用法國之崩潰與英國之有事於歐洲、而作乘人之危之舉動、但決不敢向莫斯科提出任何抗議、以自討沒趣也、</p>
<p>日圖减少與蘇衝突</p>
<p>日本對於英美接濟中國之貨牧、卽非軍用必需品、亦發怒似在、但對於莫斯科之不斷以軍火供給重慶、則竭力避免與蘇俄發生磨擦此實爲日本政策機會主義最有力之自供、由近衛此次所發之言觀之、討論太平洋之和戰問題時、對於俄國似可不必加以考慮、新近之三國同盟、雖「並不含有對共產主義妥協之意、但渠希望儘量减少蘇日衝突之來源」、史太林之政策、其目的一向在於造成世界之混亂、而已則置身於事外、其對中日同時表示友好、固然亦非不可能、但日本果與英美發生衝突、而忘却蘇俄有重複提出遠東領土要求之可能、則其爲輕率從事也明矣、</p>
<h3>滬日紗廠遭受　禁運打擊　將减少工作時間　至原料吿磬為止</h3>

<p>該會因鑒以往滬市各界對於各項捐獻義舉、素爲全國之冠、是以該會爲促使成績超越全國起見、除向各業公會·各學校·各團體·攤募外、並定國慶日起、至十七日止、提倡國慶寒衣獻金運動週、希全市各公司商店廠號等輪流舉行義買一週、務使普遍實行、至於個人方面最低限度、以一日所得、貢獻寒衣代金、希各界屆時一致舉辦、將所得悉數解繳銀行或報館、轉呈中央、用表敬意、以冀達一百萬</p>
<p>規定辦法一致努力</p>
<p>茲將該會所訂國慶週捐獻寒衣代金辦法公吿之、（一）爲普遍徵募及增加寒衣代金數額起見、特舉行國慶寒衣代金運動週、作有力之普遍捐獻、（二）除由徵募會向各業推行攤募之數額外、希各界同胞、自動盡力量以一日或數日所得、以捐獻塞衣代金、（三）各大小公司商店廠號、除在各同業公會之担任外、並希再舉行義賣一天或數天、以捐獻寒衣代金、（四）國慶寒衣代金運動週、日期自十日起全十七日止、各大公司商店廠號、得輪流舉行之、（五）凡屬國人所開設之公司商店行號最低限度、以一日義買所得、悉數呈解、以供給製備寒衣之需、</p>

<h3>穩定民食辦法　磋商已獲端倪　洋米訂價與滙市俱落　國米運滬限制漸寬放</h3>
<p>滬市整個民食問題、邇日因來源暢旺、人心軟弱、市况已漸趨穩定、昨據關係方面透露消息、兩租界當局邇日對於穩定民食間題、往返磋商、頗爲繁忙、將採取同一步驟、付諸實施、並磋商結果、聞已獲端倪、其實施日期、已不在遙、預料屆時整個民食恐慌、可迎刃而解、各檔米價、可望下落、投機米蠢、亦將迅雷不及掩耳、遭受嚴重打擊、據聞兩租界當局鑒於過去經騐、認爲欲穩定米市、首須疏通國內外米糧來源、增厚米棧存底、及取締米市塲非法交易、嚴訂市塲行號客買賣業規、故兩當局對於以上各點、決將同時進行、</p>
<p>洋米定價</p>
<p>刻因國際局勢遽變、黃金慘跌、外匯續鬆、洋米產價跟落、每包成交價格僅及七十七元左右、各方面乘機大量訂購、據米業界估計、此次訂米數量、達十五萬包以上、該項巨額洋米、業已分別裝戰法國郵船等啟運來滬、约於本月中旬可次第抵埠進棧、據悉此次訂購、大都爲一號貢米、照目前滬市每日用度計算、該項洋米足敷本市一十天之需</p>
<p>國米產量</p>
<p>國內各地產米區域算崑山·無錫·蘇州·常勢·嘉興·常州·鞠湖·嘉碧等地、邇日轉佳、惟數量仍有限制、故運滬數量、終不若戰前湧旺、昨據本市米業方面消息、一俟各地晚　登塲後、國米運滬數量、將繼續增加、又米評會報吿在此一週內、滬市存米仍與上週相差無幾、米號門市　售及堆存　市民講囤者、估計亦在三十萬包左右（因米號堆存食米增多）故滬市囤藏食米、在百萬包以上、存底極度豐厚</p>
<h3>減息不能消滅危機　銀行資金內移　盡量發揮各行經濟能力　對於上海決採保守政策</h3>
<p>浙江實業·上海·中南·金城·大陸·鹽業·等銀行。先後减低活存利率、茲悉因戰後各銀行活存激增、佔存款總額百分之七十、而缺乏相當投資之途徑、以致</p>
<p>資金過利、運用爲難、爲避免坐耗利率計、不得不採用减息辦法、社會毀譽參半、聞各銀行經一再考慮之後、活存减息不能消滅上海銀行界當前之危機、應速妥謀資金之出路、卽資金內移、蓋內地建設猛晋、需要資金正殷、資金內移、能完成</p>
<p>抗建使命、對於上海決採用保守政策、工商業放款力從審愼、拒絕足以助長囤積居奇之放款、經營地產建造房屋、亦應稍有限制、並遵照管理銀行暫行辦法之規定、不得直接經營、商業或堆積貨物、及以代理部貿易部信託部名義自行經營、嚴厲取締行員之直接經營商業、惟對於一般小錢莊之經營匯劃貼水買賣金銀等、核與政府法令不符、應請政府予以有效之制裁、</p>

<h3>勤儉治家節衣救</h3>
<p>— 馮方鳳</p>
<p>馮文鳳女士，廣東鶴山人，安樂紡織廠主鄧仲和先生之夫人；其尊人馮師韓先生，精金石，為粵中名士。當女士五六歲時，乃父卽課以書法，二十餘年來，簡練揣摩，繼續不輟，乃能博通古今百體，而隸書允稱於時。聞其運筆之妙，以在跪平掌堅，深得書法之秘，故筆力雄健，渾厚古樸，純無巾幗氣，馳名海內，要非偶然。現爲救難起見，允本報之請求，於明日起，至明年二月止，將粥字所得，全數捐助難竄？凡愛好馮女士翰墨者，請交本報衣食住行編輯部轉致爲荷。編者識。</p>
<p>勤儉持家，是我們婦女界的天職，惜衣救難，允其是我們目前應盡的責任。現在是毛絨綫的季節了，申報衣食住行特刋絨綫專號，以資提倡，並承徵稿於余，因念我們爲克盡職責起見，至少對於後開幾點，應加以深切的注意。</p>
<p>一，應盡量採用優良國貨毛絨綫，旣以培養國力，富裕民生，兼可敎育子女，使有愛國思想。</p>
<p>二，宜自己編結，勿假手於人，俾可養成勤儉習慣。且不致以有用光陰，消耗於無益或不正當娛樂之中。</p>
<p>三，應敎導自己和親友的女兒或姊妹們，實行自己編結，使有生活技能，不　存依賴心。</p>
<p>四，宜硏究新花樣，力求進步，如關於最新編結法的無綫電播音，不妨隨時收聽，以爲硏究之助。</p>
<p>五，災禍頻仍，難民載道，吾人果一念及難胞衣不蔽體。瑟縮可憐，能勿惻然有動於中。我婦女界慈善爲懷，應各自撿點櫥箱，如有敝舊衣裳，如絨綫編結物等，應卽捐助於難民，　盡人類互助之天職，兼可示子女以好榜樣。</p>
<p>六，如無　衣，應盡力節約，捐助金錢，以爲救難之用。這樣不但符合勤儉持家的本旨，兼有助於難胞們禦寒問題的解決，希望諸姑姊妹們一致起而提倡和實行！</p>
<h3>毛絨線簡史</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>四十餘年前，德商　全隆洋行，以其本國出品之龍牌及鴨牌毛絨線首决輸入中國；當時僅婦女輩購　，用以紮髮髻，與固有之絲線相間用。其後英商老公茂洋行亦繼而經營是業，見日後希望甚大，乃在滬設廠製迭；其最著名之出品爲蜂房牌（俗稱蜜蜂牌）毛絨線，行銷全國，歷時甚久，無人與之抗衡。至民國十七年，國人始有設廠自製者，自後繼起者甚多，截至今日，國產毛絨已有驚人之成功，質地已不亞於舶來品，故國人一改已往專購洋貨之習慣，而採購國貨。方今毛絨線之用途，因編結技術之日新月異，功用之合於經濟實際，已擴展至極廣大範圍，他日國產毛絨之前途，一如中華國運，光明燦爛可期也。</p>
<h3>絨線匯集地　興聖街素描</h3>
<p>— 蓓蕾</p>
<p>氣候逐漸趨於寒冷了，人們大多被上了絨線織成的衣衫。興聖街許多絨線商店裏的店員不再如夏季時的空開，而在忙着應付顧客。舊式的　櫥裏，新式的陳列窗裏，五色繽紛的絨線使路人感覺耀眼生光，這對尚米添置絨線衣杉者是一種强烈的誘惑，再看一F披着已織成的絨線外套的「模型人」，伊的態度似乎很驕傲，像在向你笑說，爲什麼不使你自已更輕暖，更時代化呢？</p>
<p>去買絨線的百分之九十以上是女性，伊們來時三二成羣，但單獨來的少女也不少。看看這樣，翻翻那樣，相互絮語了一會，於是揀了心愛的回去。有的是爲伊的父母添置，讓年邁的人可以更溫暖些。有的是爲夫婿織一件，這較向市上去買機織的好像親切得多。有的是預備送給心上人，這眞是再好沒有的適當禮物，受者的心都會因此感到愉快。有的則爲自己，一襲色澤花式美麗的絨線秋裝是時代女性所不可少的。</p>
<p>興聖街位置在法租界東區，南至民國路，北至公館馬路，交通方面，凡自法租界由西向東的電車都經過，公共租界的二路九路公共汽車，十六路十九路無軌電車，到江西路末站下來走過去也很近，短短的一條街道，絨線商店佔其半，的有三十餘家，有幾家的店面設計非常新穎，已改去舊時面目，給人以新的印象。規模稍大的都設有編結服務部，聘有專員。敎授做客編結新法，或替顧客代爲編結，服務者全係年靑姑娘，熱心，認眞，予顧客以不少便利和帮助。編結家黄培英，鮑國芳和馮秋萍三女士各有關於編結法的專書刊行，有志研究的可向各絨線商店詢購，你們定能得到不少編結上的借鏡。</p>
<p>國產毛絨的質地近年已有驚人的進步，但仍有一部份理解不淸的顧客喜歡以高價購買洋貨，店員們倒非常熱誠，總竭力勸導伊們改購國貨。不要小覤了店員們，在他們身上却寄託着國貨的曙光呢！</p>
<p>雖然已有好幾家絨線商店爲便利顧客起見，在霞飛路和靜安寺路設立分店，但興聖街仍不失爲絨線集中地，在興聖街頭，每天有無數女性的足跡，伊們是輿聖街最普遍的主顧。</p>
<h3>風行一時之雙貓牌絨線</h3>
<p>在市上各種絨線中，雙貓牌實是一種傑出的出品，它是上海毛絨紡織廠製造的。該廠規模很大，完全自紡自染，顏色鮮明，決不褪色，各種粗細磅份都有。自從發行以來，各方面一致贊美，不但在中國各地銷行，卽使是美國紐的，巴士頓，芝加哥，英屬南菲洲，美屬菲列濱，緬甸，印度，曼谷和香港等地，也無不風行一時呢。</p>
<h3>小常識</h3>
<p>— 沈靜璋女士</p>
<p>下星期爲絨線編　結專號讀者注意</p>
<p>絨衣洗滌法：用溫水（切忌用沸水）加皂粉少許，俟溶化後，再將絨衣入水，兩手輕洗，的五分鐘翻動一次，潔凈後，再用淸水漂淸，不可用力絞，宜揮之使乾。</p>
<p>絨衣保藏法：　絨衣不需用時，向太陽曬半小時後，將樟腦粉四小包，分散絨衣之四邊，用潔白紙包好，藏在箱中。</p>
<p>絨衣熨燙法：　先將絨衣反面，再用白布一方蓋上，然後噴水，用熨斗熨平。</p>
<p>絨線接頭法：　四股細絨或粗絨，分開其兩端，互相拚合，則結時平伏，且無散脫之虞。</p>
<p>簡易開鈕法：　將絨衣欲開鈕處，用左手指揷入，用縫針穿同色綫一條，在鈕洞處，每行縫一針，此種方法，簡便而調勻。</p>

<h3>一星期經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>前天承編者先生轉來席素珩女士一封信，承伊讚美我這經濟菜單對於一般家庭主婦們的貢獻，愧不敢當。據席女十說：伊因對於烹飪之道一無所知。所以求助於我，要我指定地點，親自敎授，或是介紹一所專敎烹調中菜的學校。席女士信中一番懇切的話，使我深表同呢，可是慚愧得很，自間烹調的手段太平凡，沒有當敎授的資格，兼之也沒有時間和相當的地點。說起專敎烹調中菜的學樣，目前也實在沒有，我很希望有人出來開辦。至於烹飪之道，不外煎炒燒燉煠炊拌七種，調味必須適中，不要太淡，太　，太甜，太油膩，比了學校中五花八門的科目，究竟簡單得多。我勸席女士暫時可探聽親友們中有沒有擅長烹調的，時常前去請敎，或者等　婦或左右鄰居在弄飯做菜的時候，在旁留心參觀，不須一二個月，自己一定就　動手了。閒話打住，且看本星期的菜單：</p>

<h3>上海銀行撥款救濟大學生</h3>
<p>— 維塞</p>
<p>窮學生需要救濟，這是誰也不能吾認的事實。最近上海有好幾處在做着幫助淸寒學生的工作，但我總覺得他們的力量究竟不大，難免有杯水車薪之嘆。所以問題的解決，還需耍各方面的努力，允其是有實力的各界。</p>
<p>上海商業儲蓄銀行社會事業補助委員會，自二十九年度起，每年撥十萬元作獎勵淸寒優秀的專科以上學校的學生的獎學金。這種偉大的措置，實在値得我們敬佩。我們敬佩的並不僅僅是這十萬塊錢；是因爲：也許由於它的「開頭砲」，其他的銀行，公司，洋行及各大工廠，商號，機關等，都步其後塵，形成一種以獎學爲高尙榮耀的風氣了。</p>
<p>它每年補助學生四百名，每名每年得四百元，凡是現在肄業各大學或專門學院在一年以上的淸寒優秀大學生，都可以請求此項獎學金。請求手續是：凡自問適合淸寒優秀標準的學生，可向學校當局直接申請，然後由學校當局在請求的學生中間提選適合得此項獎金的學生，保送該行。學校應保送的學生名額，由該行預先通知學校。所以學校保送學生，不得超過指定的名額。</p>
<p>如果是範圍很大的大學，而名額又很少時，那末照該行規定，應該儘先就農，醫，工，商，理各科中挑選學生。</p>
<p>如何才合於淸寒優秀的標準呢？它的章程上也明明白白地告訴我們的。淸寒的標準：（一）家裏實在沒有財產收入，（二）父兄伯叔無力幫助學膳費，（三）親戚朋友無法吿貸。優秀的標準是：（一）身體健康，（二）品行端正，（三）各科成續比較優異，（四）富於愛國思想，（五）富於服務精神。</p>
<h3>陰歷與農歷</h3>
<p>— 惕廬</p>
<p>現今柬貼上每稱陰歷爲農歷，創始者容以爲陰歷便農，故有此稱。夫陰歷行於中國久矣，農人習之，不易驟改，自是實情，若謂此歷便農，則適得其反也。</p>
<p>陰歷以一度月圓爲一月，月稱太陰，故稱陰歷。陽歷以地球繞日一週爲一年，日稱太陽，故稱陽歷。今所謂二十四節氣者，原所以示天時之寒燠，自亦以地球繞日一週爲起訖，與陽歷合。故每一節氣，於陽歷有固定之月日，卽有差亦祇一日，不若陰歷之遲早相差，甚至幾及一月也。今將二十四節氣之陽歷月日，列表於後：</p>
<p>小寒　一月五日哐六日</p>
<p>大寒　一月廿日或廿一日</p>
<p>立春　二月四日或五日</p>
<p>雨水　二月十九日或廿日</p>
<p>驚蟄　三月六日或七日</p>
<p>春分　三月廿一日或十二日</p>
<p>淸明　四月五日或六日</p>
<p>榖雨　四月廿日或廿一日</p>
<p>立夏　五月六日或七日</p>
<p>小滿　五月廿一日或廿二日</p>
<p>芒種　六月六日或七日</p>
<p>夏至　六月廿二日</p>
<p>小署　七月七日或八日</p>
<p>大署　七月廿三日廿廿四日</p>
<p>立秋　八月八日或九日</p>
<p>處署　八月廿三日或廿四日</p>
<p>白露　九月八日或九日</p>
<p>秋分　九月廿三日或廿四日</p>
<p>寒露　十月八日或九日</p>
<p>霜降　十月廿四日</p>
<p>立冬　十一月七日或八日</p>
<p>小雪　十一月廿二日或廿三日</p>
<p>大雪　十二月七日或八日</p>
<p>冬至　十二月廿二日或廿三日</p>
<p>查地球繞日一週爲三六五·二四二二日，二十四節氣之起訖，當然亦爲三六五·二四二二日，而陽歷一年，不能有不足一日之零數，止有三六五日，此所餘之·二四二二日，積四年而近乎一日，故節氣有一日之差，逮乎必需置閏之年，於二月末置閏一日，卽增一廿九日，卽將每年賸餘·二四二二日所積成之和數，大致銷去，節氣卽復歸原日。若言陰歷，其原則固以立春至立春爲一年，是亦地球繞日一週也。而其計月則以月圓爲準，每月大建三十日，小建二十九日，故一年十二月，止有三百五十四日左右，與地球繞日一週之三六五·二四二二日，相差至少在十日以上，統計每不足三年，卽須置閏一月，以正寒燠，故節氣於陰歷，均無固定之月日。卽以立春爲例，言其遲，可遲至正月十五日；言其早，可早至上一年十二月十六日，以視其陽歷月日相差不過一日者，其陰歷月日之遲早相差，可謂大矣。</p>
<p>農人耕作，須遵天時寒燠，固以節氣爲依據，若用陽歷，卽可從月日上知某一節氣之來臨，不若徒記陰歷月日之不足據，必須查視歷本也。可惜我國農人，至今不知陽歷與節氣之關係，若是其密切，故猶不願棄置陰歷耳。若夫便農之利，固惟陽歷有之，故農歷之稱，加之陽歷，始爲允當；以稱陰歷，則昧其理矣。</p>

<p>這時我忽覺有一句按捺不住的話，　從我的心坎中上升，衝破了我的喉關吐出來。「愛你？愛伊？這是什麽樣的愛？你在大學裏研究的，大概是戀愛專科，這是你新創立的戀愛哲學罷！」</p>
<p>余甘棠祇向我瞥了一瞥，沒有勇氣向我注視，便低沉了頭靜默着。</p>
<p>霍桑微笑着說道：「這原不成其爲愛。不過現在我們爲明瞭案情起見，祇好讓道個「愛」字暫時受些侮辱。甘棠兄，說下去。</p>
<p>余甘棠繼續說話的時候，聲音低弱得多了，而且也在竭丈地避免這「愛」字。他說道：「我們本來很相好，就因着這個趙伯雄的緣故，伊才冷淡我。我的伊去玩，伊總用假話推辭。因爲有一决我的伊看電影，伊說頭痛不去，可是後來我於在電影院裹瞧見伊和趙伯雄在一起。後來我在伊家裏碰見這姓趙的，大家就吵起來。我曾電隨這傢伙的踪跡，才知他住在亞東七七四號。在十七日那天，有朋友告訴我，上夜裏瞧見麗蘭到亞東七樓七七四號裏去。經我在十七夜間到旅館中去調查以後，果眞確實。昨天早晨，我打電話去問麗蘭，伊也老實承認。我富眞曾向伊說過幾句恐嚇的話，剛才警廳寡那姓倪的所說關於我的一切行動，的確都是事實，我用不着抵賴。不過我對於麗蘭，祇想嚇伊一嚇，讓伊斷絕那姓趙的。我並沒有打死俘的意思——這是絕對沒有的，因爲我知道伊雖然這樣子浪漫，伊的心還是———還是———屬於我的。」</p>
<p>霍桑脣角上露着掛笑，好像在笑他避忌這個「愛」字，的確用着十二分的力量。他仍淡淡地問道：「你旣然沒有打死伊的意思，爲什麽向你的朋友宋兆麒去借手槍？」</p>
<p>余甘棠急忙答道：「這不是要打麗蘭，老實說，我要找那姓趙的算賬。我到伊家裹去探聽，也爲的是他。我覺得我和他勢力不兩立！」　（一二九）</p>

<h3>U.S. Navy Secretary Warns Germany, Italy, and Japan: Confident in Two-Ocean Warfare; States U.S. Navy Prepared to Accept Challenges at Any Time; U.S. Navy Personnel to Increase to Over 240,000</h3>
<p>Washington - U.S. Navy Secretary Knox stated in a speech to officers yesterday that if the United States is challenged, the U.S. Navy will meet the challenge on the high seas, and the Army will meet it on the battlefield. When the Army and Navy are engaged, it is your responsibility to defend against traitors and prevent them from stabbing us in the back. At this time, a sufficiently powerful navy must be able to engage the enemy far from our shores and simultaneously defeat them in both oceans. We must now take swift action in a realistic manner to address the issue of conquering Europe and invading England. The exchange of several over-age destroyers for eight British bases has shifted the Atlantic naval operations area 1,000 miles eastward. Patrol bombers and naval vessels operating from these bases can intercept the enemy in the middle of the Atlantic. I recently inspected the Pacific Fleet. I can tell you that it is the strongest and most effective fleet in the world today, and it can fully support America's traditional naval victories. Knox then spoke about the responsibility of the police to prevent sabotage, saying that there are hundreds, even thousands, of saboteurs within the country, and enemies of democracy surround us. He also said that the purpose of the German-Italian-Japanese alliance is aimed at the United States, and the United States has never yielded to intimidation. A test may come in the future, and only God knows whether this test will be on the battlefield or a voluntary one. Fifth column activities may occur, and this must be prevented. We must place secret parties within the country who can harm us in places where they cannot contact outsiders and cannot cause trouble. If the United States is forced to fight, we must be prepared for it. We have never lost a war. We are the biggest obstacle in the process of totalitarianism. If Britain cannot stem the tide of continued advance by the thugs, we will be surrounded by these international thugs. Their greatest victory would be the destruction of the United States.

<p>U.S. Navy Department Orders Call-Up of All Reserve Troops</p>
<p>Washington - U.S. Navy Secretary Knox has ordered the call-up of all reserve troops in the Navy and Marine Corps. A total of over 27,000 people are required to comply with the order. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Washington - Today, the U.S. Navy has called up all its fleets, both active and reserve, including 33,481 enlisted personnel and 1,610 officers who have already registered. This decision by the Navy to issue the call-up order complements the National Guard mobilization order issued some time ago. The Navy Department stated that the reserve call-up will be completed in the "shortest possible time." These reserve troops will be used to fill gaps in the Navy, and the nation is also paying close attention to "medical" defense. If the Japanese army invades the Dutch East Indies, there will be a panic over the military necessity of quinine. A U.S. Army medical officer said that the nation's quinine supply can only meet one year's consumption during peacetime. (International Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Washington - Following U.S. Navy Secretary Knox's warning to the Axis powers' allied nations, the U.S. government issued an order last night to increase the number of reserve troops to 27,000 in order to strengthen naval combat power. If this happens, the number of naval personnel will reach 243,492. (United Press, 6th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Delivers Speech: Condemns European Dictatorships</h3>
<p>Hyde Park, New York - President Roosevelt delivered a speech here to students yesterday, condemning European dictatorships for depriving young people of the right to obtain full knowledge of world affairs. He said that American youth are not subject to censorship, restrictions, forced labor camps, or military training as enslaved citizens. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Washington - If President Roosevelt is re-elected, will he join the European war? This question has been widely discussed before, but it only became clear after Roosevelt publicly praised Wallace's astonishing speech. Wallace said that the Republican Party is the appeasement party of America today. Wallace insisted that the United States has no other way to defeat Hitler except by resorting to war. Wallace's speech is a representation of Roosevelt's future policy. Wallace's speech was not made on the spur of the moment, but a premeditated attack on the Republican Party's claim to be a party of peace. Therefore, it can be inferred that the Democratic Party is a pro-war party. The most important question in the upcoming presidential election is the question of war or peace. Will Roosevelt participate in the war after November? Why does he call the Republicans the party of peace? Is he planning to incite public opinion and instigate war with this? But at least it can be regarded as a path to the political strategy of the New Deal movement. (International Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>New York - The New York World-Telegram published an article by General Johnson today, pointing out that the rumors that Willkie is a character protected by the Axis powers is a tactic of those who support Roosevelt's re-election and can be said to be a cunning election strategy. Recently, the foreign policy of the United States has harmed the political and economic system of the United States. Roosevelt is afraid that people will see through his weaknesses, so he tries to raise other issues to divert the attention of the American people. (Haitong Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Hyde Park - President Roosevelt delivered a nationwide radio address last night, explaining the purpose of the New Deal, saying it was to prevent poverty in the United States. The President also said that America's universal education system is the best fortress for democratic countries to resist dictatorships in times of crisis. The President repeatedly stated that the government must always be responsible for ensuring that those who are willing to work but cannot find work are not left to freeze and starve. This speech by the President is sufficient to demonstrate his final attitude towards his third re-election campaign. (United Press, 6th)</p>
<p>Aberdeen, South Dakota - U.S. Democratic Vice Presidential candidate Wallace, after giving campaign speeches in thirteen states over fifteen days, left here last night to return to Washington. It is said that Wallace feels that the general situation is extremely supportive of the New Deal and hopes to win next month and will report this situation to the President. Wallace is the person responsible for the Democratic Party's campaign. President Roosevelt must pay attention to the crises in Europe and the Far East, so he remains in Washington and entrusts campaign affairs to Wallace. One of Wallace's important tools in his campaign policy is to advocate for the support of small businessmen and workers. Wallace said that the New Deal is to protect these businessmen and workers from the encroachments of Wall Street. Wallace also strongly stated that the Democratic Party fundamentally pays attention to agricultural prosperity and recognizes this as an element of protecting democracy against foreign aggression. (United Press, 6th)</p>
<p>New Orleans - The Jacksonville Journal reported that if the spiritual assistance of the entire American people is effective, then we are already involved in the First and Second World Wars, because the dictatorships are becoming bolder and signing new agreements to increase their destructive power, so the hatred of totalism among Americans is also increasing. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3>Newspaper Circles Especially Concerned About the Opening of the Burma Road</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The Hochi Shimbun issued a warning today, saying that if Britain and the United States cooperate to reopen the Burma Road on October 17, it will inevitably lead to a world war, because "the current major crisis in the Pacific means that the United States should make every effort to avoid this reckless action." The Chugai Shimbun commented that when Prime Minister Konoe spoke in Kyoto last week, he said that the fate of the Pacific is entirely in the hands of the United States. We attach primary importance to Japan's position in the Far East, and the comments also stated that Konoe's statement that the signing of the Tripartite Pact was to prepare to accept provocations from other countries truly represents the emotions of the entire Japanese nation. (United Press, 6th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Denies International News Service Report</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka met with a United Press reporter today and claimed that the statement by an International News Service reporter about a meeting with him was absolutely false. He regarded this as a "reckless act by a certain American reporter." When the reporter asked him to explain the statement attributed to Matsuoka that "if the United States blindly insists on maintaining the status quo in the Pacific, we will fight the United States. It is better to destroy the status quo than to maintain it," Matsuoka replied with emotion, "There is really no need to explain this, because someone in a responsible position such as a foreign minister would not have such an argument, and I have never said this. However, since this matter has made it difficult for people to trust me, I will never meet with American reporters again." According to the Yomiuri Shimbun, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already instructed the ambassador to the United States to protest to the Liberty magazine regarding the malicious anti-Japanese report by the International News Service about the meeting with Matsuoka.

<h3>Soviet Defense Commissioner's Speech: Preparing to Deal with Any Eventuality; States Border Threats Have Not Been Removed; Soviet Union Recalls Military Attaché to Japan, May Be About to Launch Something</h3>
<p>Moscow - Soviet Defense Commissioner Timoshenko told graduates of the Army University here yesterday, "The Soviet Union should be prepared to deal with any eventuality, because the threat to our borders has not yet been removed." Addressing the Army University graduates who are about to take office, Timoshenko said, "The Second Imperialist War is surrounding both East and West. You are joining the army at this time. Although the Soviet Union is safe from the scope of the war thanks to Stalin's clever peaceful policies, this cannot be regarded as the removal of the threat to our borders." (United Press, 6th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Soviet Colonel Gusingo, the military attache at the Soviet Embassy in Japan, has been ordered to return home to report on the signing of the alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan. People here are very concerned about Colonel Gusingo's trip and believe that the Soviet Union may launch something as a result of the three countries' alliance. It is reported that Colonel Gusingo took the Japanese mail ship "Harbin Maru" to Vladivostok and then went to Moscow and is scheduled to return to his post in the middle of next month. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>Moscow - A full-scale air raid prevention exercise has been underway in Leningrad since Friday and is still in progress. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3>U.S. and Mexico Organize Joint Defense Committee</h3>
<p>Mexico City - Sources say that Mexican Defense Minister General Castro will be making a report on the establishment of a joint defense committee between the United States and Mexico. (Haitong Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Washington - According to newspapers here, the U.S. government has now decided to support the newly elected Mexican President General Camacho. Although Washington and Mexico City authorities are remaining silent, both sides have decided to organize a U.S.-Mexico joint defense committee to handle military matters. The United States will ask Mexico to borrow naval and air force bases. (Haitong Telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3>Burma Bans Entry of British Banknotes Except from India</h3>
<p>Rangoon - The Governor of Burma has ordered a ban on bringing banknotes from the Bank of England into Burma from any country other than India, unless permitted by the Reserve Bank of India. The Reserve Bank of India has issued a notice in accordance with this ban, allowing ordinary travelers to bring in Bank of England banknotes up to a limit of £10. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Army and Navy Enlistment Limited to Unmarried Men</h3>
<p>Washington - A document here states that the U.S. authorities have drafted an order that U.S. Army and Navy enlistment will be temporarily limited to unmarried men. It is said that President Roosevelt will sign this order in the near future, and it is expected to be announced soon. (Haitong Telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3>British Colonies Donate to War Fund</h3>
<p>London - The Sudanese government has allocated £100,000 to give to Britain to purchase a squadron of fighter planes to show the Sudanese people's support for the British government and their confidence in British victory. Minister of Aircraft Production Beaverbrook telegraphed the Sudanese government, saying that when the war is won and world peace is restored in the future, we will never forget those who helped us in times of need.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Konoe's Remarks and the United States</h3>
<p>Regardless of which country, whether in peacetime or wartime, securing allies is always regarded as a major undertaking. However, gaining allies can sometimes be tantamount to increasing national strength or removing threats, but it can also lead to being thrown into a dangerous abyss and incurring serious consequences. The non-aggression pact established between the Soviet Union and Germany last year is clearly an example of the former, while Japan's conclusion of the Tripartite Pact this time, based on the international reaction in recent days, undoubtedly means taking the unfortunate path of the latter.</p>
<p>This newspaper has discussed the Tripartite Pact and its impact in detail in recent days. One point that should be given special attention is that Germany and Italy have gained practical benefits from this alliance, while Japan has simply increased its burden. Because the main purpose of the alliance is to restrain the United States, under the current international situation, this is Germany and Italy relying on Japan to achieve their goals, and Japan cannot obtain any practical assistance from Germany and Italy. After years of diplomatic isolation, Japan suddenly gained two hot new powers as allies, which may be somewhat comforting in spirit, but the huge price it must pay is precisely equal to the future of the entire nation. Prime Minister Konoe's remarks on two occasions a few days ago have clearly indicated that the conclusion of this alliance has the potential to lead to a U.S.-Japan war. In fact, the content of Konoe's remarks is nothing more than a restatement of the East Asia Monroe Doctrine declaration made by Japanese Foreign Minister Arita on May 29. The only difference is that no one echoed Japan's demands at that time, so his attitude was euphemistic and more moderate. This time, Konoe happened to have obtained the German-Italian alliance, so he did not hesitate to intimidate with the threat of war. This alone shows that even if Japan has not gained any practical benefits from the Tripartite Pact, it has increased its vain air and is indulging in new adventurous fantasies. In Konoe's remarks, in addition to demonstrating force, there is also another side of offering inducements; in addition to repelling, there is also another side of showing goodwill. The so-called inducement is the attempt to use the recognition of the United States' leading position in the Western Hemisphere as an exchange condition for the United States' recognition of the "new order" in Asia and Europe. In the original text of the Tripartite Pact, there is no mention of the situation in the Americas, which is obviously done deliberately to leave this gap in order to deal with the needs of the United States. This is sufficient to echo the previous German statement that the American Monroe Doctrine can only be effective if the United States does not interfere in European affairs. Looking back to the beginning of July this year, President Roosevelt authorized Secretary Hull to issue a statement on the Monroe Doctrine. The so-called exchange condition may have been caused by that statement. In fact, even if all the actual measures of the United States are ignored, it is sufficient to prove from Hull's statement itself that the Monroe Doctrine imagined by the United States has absolutely no similarity to the so-called "new order" in Asia and Europe. Since the United States has no aggressive ambitions and does not want to invade or enslave any large or small countries in the same continent, the leadership position that Konoe mentioned can be used by Japan to establish its hegemony in the Far East, but it has no meaning for the United States. The international situation has evolved to the current extent, and yet such superficial suggestions are put forward. This is either deliberately ignoring the fundamental position of the United States or feigning deafness to the firm policy of the United States. According to a United Press Tokyo dispatch on the 5th, after Konoe's remarks were published, there was very little saber-rattling atmosphere in Japanese public opinion. On the contrary, in general, there is hope that the United States can understand Japanese policy, which shows that the reckless war cries are not supported by the Japanese people. However, the understanding between the United States and Japan can never be obtained on the basis of the Tripartite Pact or the "New Order in East Asia." This cannot be achieved by the Japanese side feigning deafness.</p>
<p>Japan's current approach to dealing with the United States is clearly the same strategy as it previously used against Britain. However, even though Britain has wavered several times, the final outcome of its evolution has proved that the concept of maintaining the status quo and the policy of appeasement have both run into obstacles in the Far East. As for the United States, if it had encountered a threat a year ago, it might have caused the isolationists to become more rampant and the U.S. authorities' Far East policy to be restrained. However, recent lessons have been too profound, and everyone has realized that this international crisis cannot be solved by cowardice and evasion. In addition to vigorously expanding armaments and carrying out two-ocean defense, U.S. Navy Secretary Knox made it clear the other day that if the United States encounters a challenge, the U.S. Army and Navy will deal with it on the high seas and on the battlefield. This statement is sufficient to represent the fundamental attitude of the United States in responding to the Tripartite Pact and the various situations caused by the Tripartite Pact.</p>
<p>Clausewitz, the genius theorist of war, said: "War is more on the side of the defender than on the side of the aggressor. Because aggression causes resistance, and resistance makes war possible. The aggressor always loves peace. He hopes to invade our country without bloodshed. However, he will eventually have to prepare for bloodshed, because we want war, and he has to prepare for war." Words are no longer as frightening as they were some time ago. Now that the defender has made sufficient determination and preparation, whether the aggressor's war preparations can meet his desires is still a big question.</p>
<p>Demonstrating force and offering inducements are two-pronged approaches to dealing with the United States, and the answers obtained are all uncertain, as mentioned above. As for repelling and showing goodwill, the target is not limited to one country, and its significance will be analyzed further.</p>
<h3>Xinhua Daily Comments on U.S.-Japan Conflict</h3>
<p>Chongqing's Xinhua Daily recently stated that the recent remarks by the Japanese Prime Minister and Foreign Minister are only a kind of intimidation, the purpose of which is to cause President Roosevelt to suffer a defeat in the upcoming election. The newspaper said, "The dispute between the United States and Japan cannot be resolved except by war. However, neither country is fully prepared at the moment. Therefore, we believe that Tokyo's remarks are only a kind of intimidation. The U.S. election period is approaching, and President Roosevelt has obviously gained the support of the U.S. business class. Roosevelt himself is the protagonist of the opposition to the Axis powers. Japan is using the war-fearing mentality of the U.S. business class to intimidate, so that the business class will abandon its support for Roosevelt. This is the real purpose of Konoe and Matsuoka's challenge to the United States. (6th</p>

<h3>Military Affairs Commission Announces Weekly War Situation, September 29 to October 5</h3>
<p>Chongqing - A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission said that since this week (September 29 to October 5), the more important of the combat experiences of the Chinese armies on all fronts are as follows:</p>
<p>Shanxi-Henan: The Chinese army in southeastern Shanxi attacked Liaoxian and Yushe south of the Zhengtai Railway. After two days and nights of bloody battles, they recovered Yushe, killing more than 500 Japanese soldiers and capturing several large and small cannons and dozens of light and heavy machine guns. The siege of Japanese troops trapped in Liaoxian is still underway. The Chinese army in southern Shanxi successively attacked various strongholds such as Zhangmao Avenue, Jidu Longzhang, and Jijiapo Beizhuang in recent days. Currently, Zhangmao and Jiemo are both controlled by the Chinese army. The Chinese army in western Shanxi captured Shuangchi Town (west of Lingshi) in three mornings. The Japanese troops retreated to Fenyang. Various strongholds such as Xilincun, Zhuzhaocun, and Beijiacun in the suburbs of Wenxian County in northern Henan have been recovered by the Chinese army. They are now taking advantage of the victory to launch a fierce attack on Wenxian County. The Chinese army in eastern Henan has launched attacks on Zhecheng and Huaiyang in recent days and engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese troops in the suburbs of Huaiyang City. The Chinese army successively broke into the north and south passes. The Chinese army in southern Henan has launched attacks on the Xinyang area in recent days, thoroughly destroying Japanese transportation.</p>
<p>Shandong-Jiangsu: The Chinese army in northern Shandong launched attacks on Shanghe, Huimin, Zhanhua, and Jiyang on the 1st and 2nd, wiping out more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers, capturing more than 50 Japanese soldiers, and seizing a large number of weapons, ammunition, and other military supplies. The Chinese army in western Shandong entered Gaotang City on the afternoon of the 1st. The Chinese army in northern Jiangsu carried out sweeps against the Japanese army in the area west of Gaoyou and Baoying on the south bank of Hongze Lake. The Chinese army in southern Jiangsu has launched attacks on Jurong, Jintan, Zhenjiang, and other places in recent days. One route forced its way to the suburbs of Jurong, and the other route carried out large-scale destruction on the Jintan-Wujin Highway, killing 300 Japanese officers and soldiers below the rank of battalion commander and seizing a large number of spoils of war. Another route engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese army outside the south gate of Zhenjiang and is still launching a fierce attack.</p>
<p>Hubei-Hunan: The Chinese army on the east bank of the Xianghe River in Hubei launched attacks on the Japanese army in the direction of Jingzhong Road, Henglingguan, and Wenjiazui in recent days. The Chinese army on the west bank attacked the Japanese stronghold of Zhujiabu (near the Xianghe River) northeast of Jingmen. The Japanese suffered 600 casualties. The Japanese army in Tongshan, Tongcheng, and other places in southern Hubei repeatedly attacked Jiuling but were defeated by the Chinese army. The Chinese army in northern Hunan destroyed many Japanese troop trains near Yanglousi Station in recent days.</p>
<p>Jiangxi-Anhui: The Japanese troops near Nanchang in Jiangxi Province launched an attack on the vicinity of Xishan on the morning of the 28th. After being met by the Chinese army, they were defeated and retreated. The Japanese troops in Ruichang quickly launched an attack on Minshan in three routes. The Chinese army launched counterattacks on various routes, with elite troops attacking the rear of the Japanese army. After a fierce battle until the morning of the 30th, the Japanese troops were unable to support and retreated. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory and extended to the city of Ruichang, launching a siege. More than 2,000 Japanese troops from Bengbu and other places in northern Anhui Province attacked Xuyi. After being severely attacked by the Chinese army, they suffered heavy casualties. The Chinese army in central Anhui launched surprise attacks on the Japanese troops in various strongholds in Hexian County in recent days.

<p>Other War Results: (1) The Chinese army in Suijing has launched attacks on Anbei Gaotailiang and other areas in the past week, successively capturing strongholds such as Longgemiao Liuxigou and Zhangsanwei. (2) Thousands of Japanese troops in western Zhejiang launched attacks on Lian City and Shanlian, which belong to Tongxiang, but were completely defeated by the Chinese army and took advantage of the situation to recover Liuli Bridge. (3) The Japanese troops in Xinhui and Shengang in southern Guangdong Province repeatedly launched harassing attacks on the Chinese army, but suffered heavy casualties and retreated in defeat. Another unit of the Chinese army stormed into Yaoshi on the 2nd and killed a large number of Japanese soldiers. (Telegram, 5th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Impacted by the European War: Agricultural Economic Panic; U.S. Government Intensifies Production Control</h3>
<p>Washington – Due to the sacrifices suffered by the United States because of foreign wars, the first loss is that of the cotton and wheat markets. A large surplus of agricultural products is now piling up in most parts of the United States. The victory of the Nazis has blocked the market for these goods. If Britain is defeated, American agricultural products will lose their largest customer. The prevailing discussion in the U.S. Congress is that foreign events of any kind are not related to U.S. interests. It is believed that Germany can conquer the continent and Britain can encounter difficulties and misfortune, but people in Congress think that these events are only theoretically related to the U.S. However, this view is now greatly questioned. The problem comes from a few difficult facts. Take an example to illustrate: Ten million people in the United States rely on cotton for their livelihoods, and normally 60% of U.S. cotton production is exported. Britain is the largest customer of the United States, but the purchases from the continent are also considerable. Up to August 1 of this year, the total amount of cotton purchased from abroad was 6.9 million bales. It seems fortunate that the U.S. industry can consume the equivalent amount. Next year, the U.S. will be able to sell 2 million bales out of a total of 22 million bales. Therefore, by next August, the U.S. may have 15 million bales of cotton in hand, not counting the new cotton. Even if cotton farmers take a year off, there will still be too much cotton left over. As for wheat, the U.S. had a surplus of 280 million bushels last year, and the new wheat is estimated at 760 million bushels. The annual consumption of the United States is only 650 million bushels, so after another year, there will be 380 million bushels of wheat left over. Canada also had a large surplus of wheat last year, and this year's production is very abundant. Canadian wheat can export 100 million bushels each year, but looking at the market's capacity, it can only accommodate 40 million bushels. Therefore, the future of farmers in both countries does not look smooth. In addition, the British fleet continues to blockade the continent, and the market may become even narrower. As for the U.S. fruit growers, 30% to 40% of their harvest is sold overseas, and their gains depend on these markets. The situation of the dried fruit industry is also the same. Britain is a major customer of American agricultural products, but various countries in Europe also occupy an important position. If a large amount of cotton cannot be sold in the future, other methods must be devised to deal with this matter. If the wheat market is lost, measures must also be taken for cotton farmers. The same applies to tobacco planters. As for prices, they have already been affected by the shrinking market and have fallen to the lowest quality level since September 1939. From all aspects, it can be seen that the current need of the United States is to increase production control. This means designing to adjust America's largest industries to adapt to new conditions. Some people hope that trade with Germany after the war can avoid this severe relief, but the Pétain government claims that France will become a purely agricultural country, which is what Germany wants. Germany's plan is to control Europe as an industrial nation, set the purchasing conditions as it sees fit, and adopt methods that are unfavorable to the United States. Germany has also decided to build a Europe that can be as self-sufficient as possible. If Germany conquers Britain, it will be even more unfavorable to American farmers, because once the wishes of the Nazi soldiers are realized, the hope of the United States for a large overseas market for agricultural products will be completely cut off. As a result, American agriculture will be permanently disrupted. This disruption will soon be felt by the business community. (6th International Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Attack Chongqing; British Embassy Destroyed; Many Foreign Properties Damaged; Dozens of Civilian Casualties</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Forty-two Japanese planes, in two batches, invaded Chongqing City at noon on the 6th. The first batch consisted of twenty-seven planes and the second batch consisted of fifteen planes. They indiscriminately dropped bombs and incendiary bombs on residential areas and foreign consulate areas, destroying and damaging more than 300 civilian houses, causing dozens of casualties. Some incendiary bombs were extinguished by defenders upon landing, so they did not spread. In addition, the Catholic Charity Hospital was bombed, and part of the British Embassy was also destroyed. Many other foreign properties were damaged. Doors and windows were tilted, and walls were peeling off in the consulate area. (6th Dispatch)</p>

He stated that the land Thailand is requesting previously belonged to Thailand and is still inhabited by Thais. Many of these Thais have returned to Thailand. Thailand's demands are recognized by all countries as legitimate, but France has not expressed its intention to accept the demands or put forward any suggestions. Thailand does not want to use force because the residents of that area are compatriots of the Thai people, and there is no reason to fight among themselves. He continued that Thailand's demands are far-reaching and cannot be resolved in two or three days. Thailand must find a fair solution. If peaceful means cannot achieve this goal, Thailand must continue to work hard. The content of the request is very complicated and must take time, but France also advocates justice and will be able to provide a satisfactory answer. Thailand should wait quietly for this answer.

<h3>Rumor that Axis Powers Have Drafted Winter War Plan Against Britain; Inducing Spain and Portugal to Join Cooperation; North Africa Expected to Become Center of Gravity of War</h3>
<p>Rome - Authoritative sources here report that Führer Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini are now submitting plans to Nationalist Spain to assign it a specific task in the Axis powers' winter war against Britain. It is believed that General Franco will announce his intentions in Madrid this week. Authoritative sources claim that the Axis powers' mission for Spain's entry into the European war was delivered to Spanish Interior Minister Suñer yesterday morning by Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. Circles here last night generally believed that the Axis powers had drafted a plan to allow Spain to cooperate more actively this winter. Some parties have also proposed that General Franco induce Portugal to join the Rome-Berlin Axis. According to information obtained last night, even if Spain maintains its non-belligerent status, the Axis powers hope to establish submarine bases in the Canary Islands and the Madeira Islands to intensify the blockade of Britain and intercept ships from South Africa in the future. Reliable sources also claim that Führer Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini discussed the issue of drawing the Soviet Union and Japan closer together at the Brenner Pass meeting. It is believed that Italy's intensified aid to Britain was also within the most important scope of discussion. The most well-informed sources believe that the Axis powers will take a more severe stance on the United States' continued aid to Britain in the future. It is believed here that the Axis powers are currently preparing to extend the war into the winter, but the Germans frequently mention the imminent landing in Britain. For this reason, it is generally believed here that Germany's attempt to land in Britain is about to be implemented, but it is also unknown. It is believed that whether the landing is successful or not, the Axis powers will concentrate their strength on the Suez Canal. (6th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital - This newspaper correspondent stationed in Rome reports that with respect to the talks between the two leaders of Germany and Italy yesterday in Brenner Pass, Italian official personnel refused to give opinions. Reportedly, this talk has emphasized the problems of Spain and North Africa, and has not touched on Southeastern Europe. For this reason, it is expected that the North Africa corner will soon become the focus of warfare against Britain. (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Vichy - According to diplomatic personnel here last night, it is believed that the results of the meeting between German Führer Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini last week at the Brenner Pass will first affect the Balkans. There is a general consensus here that the reports received, stating that Italian troops concentrated 120,000 troops and 100 tanks on the Greek border, are extremely serious, and that Greek troops are also very active. It is now undisguised that the Axis powers and their allies in the Aegean Sea will inflict a "fatal attack" on Britain. Vichy officials firmly believe that the main consequence of the Brenner Pass meeting is another Axis agreement in the Balkans. It is believed that this agreement is calculated to satisfy Bulgaria's territorial demands and give it an outlet to the Aegean Sea to the south. Italian sources here last night indicated that the decision of the Brenner Pass meeting may be to increase Germany's power in the Mediterranean, especially in Egypt, where Italian troops are clearly unable to make further progress. (6th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>The New York Times wrote that the meeting of German and Italian dictators at the Brenner Pass was nothing short of announcing to the world that Germany's terror strategy had failed and Hitler's promise of a final victory had not materialized. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Troops Gather on the Border; Italian-Greek Relations Tense; Italy to Convene Balkan Conference to Discuss Unresolved Issues</h3>
<p>Athens - The rumors that Italian troops, including some heavy artillery, have arrived on the border between Greece and Albania have caused great unease in the Greek capital. Officials stated that the rumors were manufactured by foreign parties. Political observers believe that the Greek government is prepared to set up defenses on the Greek border. 50% of the reservists conscripted in Epirus have reached their posts, and private cars have also been requisitioned. Rumors have been rampant in Athens in recent days, such as the claim that the Italian minister presented an ultimatum to the Greek government yesterday, but this is not the case. (6th Haitong Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hungarian Capital - According to news arriving in the Hungarian capital, Greece has concentrated 150,000 troops on the Albanian border to resist Italy's territorial ambitions. According to news, Greece is now planning to compromise with Bulgaria to jointly deal with the threat from Italy. It is known that the Greek diplomatic delegation has secretly arrived in the Bulgarian capital, planning to offer Bulgaria a corridor to a free port on the Aegean Sea. Greece is clearly seeking to compromise with Bulgaria so as to avoid Bulgaria's threat in the northeast when fighting Italy in the northwest. Political circles believe that Greece is now trying to prevent Bulgaria from demanding all of Thrace. (6th International Dispatch)</p>
<p>Switzerland's capital "Basel News" recently carried a telegram from a correspondent stationed in various countries in the Balkan Peninsula, stating that the capitals of various countries in the Balkan Peninsula generally expect Italy to convene a conference of various countries in the Balkans soon to discuss issues that the Axis powers deem unresolved. However, Italy will only invite Romania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia to participate in this conference. The theme of the discussion will be the attitudes of Greece and Turkey, because the Axis powers believe that it is urgent to clarify the positions of the two countries. (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Athens - The motorcycles and ships requisitioned by the Greek authorities the day before yesterday have already been released, and those that have not yet been returned to their owners are expected to be returned within a day or two.

Suñer met with Ciano on that day and left Berlin for Rome fifteen minutes after Ciano departed on the 29th, meeting with Mussolini and Ciano several times. Suñer's visit to Italy lasted longer than planned. He left Rome yesterday morning and arrived here in the afternoon. (6th Haitong Dispatch)</p>

<h3>British Military Leaders Study Counter-Offensive Strategies Against Germany; Maintain Advantage at Sea and in the Sky; Optimistic About Future of the War</h3>
<p>London - A Reuters military correspondent stated that it is believed that British naval, land, and air force leaders are now planning tactics aimed at invading Germany. The possibility of Germany invading Britain has now been eliminated, and preparations for a large-scale counter-offensive are being considered. However, if Britain wants to attack Germany, it must cross the sea. Then how will it be done? If the attacking army has full advantages at sea and in the sky, enough to form a long bridge and make maritime and aerial transport continuous, then several places in Europe can be attacked. The British army's failure to land in Norway in the past was because it did not consider this principle. Military strategists have learned many lessons from the past, and in future wars, it may not be impossible to attack Austria via the Adriatic Sea or Italy's Trieste. However, this is only one of the many strategies that British naval power allows the British to plan. The freedom of the British to transport troops is what the Axis powers fear most. More than 250,000 troops have been transported from Britain, India, South Africa, Ceylon, and Australia to the Middle East without losing a single person along the way. The situation in the Middle East has changed greatly as a result. No wonder Graziani, commander-in-chief of the Italian army in Libya, is crying out to Rome that a large army is approaching and is difficult to deal with. If the British army attacks Germany in the future, the people of Poland and other countries that have been ravaged will also be eager to try and support the British. The German army will be unable to cope. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Political Commentator Observes the European War; Believes It Will Be Prolonged</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Renowned international political writer Mr. Kinoshita disclosed in a recent issue of a certain political magazine that the Anglo-German war will last a long time. Since the outbreak of the European war, most of the predictions made by general politicians and military experts around the world about the progress of the European war have been wrong. I believe that the Anglo-German war will be prolonged. The reason for this can be seen in the Spanish Civil War, that is, the air force cannot capture cities alone. The amazing war record of the German army in Europe is the result of the effective joint use of aircraft and mechanized units. The Strait of Dover is indeed very narrow, but it is still a sea. If ships are not used, the German army cannot fly across it. Hitler may take advantage of the opportunity of rapid action and large numbers to send troops across the strait, like locusts covering the sky. However, with the British light fleet plus 50 new destroyers obtained from the United States, its ability is enough to prevent the advance of German submarines in the middle of the sea. The United States also has a tendency to join the war next spring. If so, the situation will be favorable to the United States. Therefore, judging from the current situation in all aspects, Germany must wage a long-term war against Britain. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Air Blitzkrieg Returns; Swarms of German Aircraft Heavily Attack London Like Locusts; Strengthened British Air Defenses Prevent Penetration of the Central District; British Communiqué Claims 23 German Aircraft Shot Down</h3>
<p>London. After several days of relative quiet, the German Air Force has reprised its blitzkrieg tactics, launching a large-scale attack on Britain. Yesterday, throughout the day, large formations of German aircraft, ranging from fifty to hundreds, penetrated the airspace over the southeastern coast. In the evening, waves of high-speed bomber aircraft arrived in the London area. However, the German bombers invading London encountered the most intense anti-aircraft fire of the week. According to a communiqué from the Air Ministry, as of 7:30 PM, at least 23 German aircraft had been destroyed, while British losses amounted to nine fighters. It is reported that four of the airmen are safe. Most of the German aircraft attempting to penetrate London over the southeastern coast were repelled by the formidable British anti-aircraft fire. The drone of the German bombers was drowned out by the roar of the anti-aircraft fire. The sky over London was heavily overcast last night, but illuminated by numerous British searchlights, creating a bright expanse. At one point, three German bombers were spotted by searchlights, and anti-aircraft guns unleashed concentrated fire at the locations indicated by the searchlights, paying particular attention to attacking a bomber that had dropped a large number of incendiary bombs. The sound of gunfire was like thunder, reverberating through the clouds. Observers acknowledged that at certain times last night, the intensity of the anti-aircraft fire was unprecedented since the outbreak of war, and many new types of anti-aircraft guns were seen firing fiercely, resembling a large ring of fire. After midnight, the intensity of the German air raids lessened somewhat, becoming intermittent. This morning, a small number of German aircraft attempted to penetrate central London. Although some incendiary bombs fell in London, most failed to ignite. According to reports up to midnight, German bombs only landed in two areas within the London region, neither of which was central London, which is a testament to the effectiveness of the anti-aircraft fire. During last night's air raid, a woman gave birth to a baby girl in a basement on Fleet Street in London. A policewoman and a caretaker from the upper floors of the building above the basement assisted with the delivery. The clerk managing the basement stated that both mother and daughter are doing well. (United Press, 6th)</p>
<p>Berlin. This morning, large formations of German bombers reappeared over London. Bombers led by Lieutenant Kuhn dropped heavy bombs on armaments factories near London. Boiler rooms exploded, causing heavy losses. German aircraft also dropped mines in British ports. Another German aircraft made a low-level attack on a British convoy, hitting one ship with several bombs, which immediately caught fire and was enveloped in smoke. Last night, a German bomber in eastern England struck a large vessel escorted by a British destroyer. Although the British ship’s anti-aircraft fire was extremely dense, the German aircraft was still able to score a direct hit. (Haitong Telegraph, 6th)</p>
<p>London. Yesterday, German bombers and fighters launched attacks in batches, incessantly throughout the day. As of 11 PM (8 AM Shanghai time this morning), 23 German aircraft had been destroyed, and the British had also lost nine fighters, with four pilots unharmed. According to Air Ministry intelligence, German fighters arrived in formations of fifty or one hundred, attempting to lure British fighters into the air to engage in combat. Small groups of bombers also flew in, their main target perhaps also to lure British aircraft into action. However, each attack was repelled by British anti-aircraft defenses before causing major damage. Several enemy aircraft flew over the coasts of Kent and Sussex. It is reported that bombs fell on several coastal towns, and a small number of bombs also hit the London area, causing very minor material damage. Some houses were destroyed in Hastings and Metway, which were attacked twice, and the number of deaths and injuries in various places was also small. Some bombs fell on the East End and southeastern suburbs of London. A streetcar was hit near a bomb, and it is reported that the streetcar driver was killed and several people injured. A small number of aircraft sneaked into the airspace over central London, but were bombarded by anti-aircraft fire and then driven away by British fighters without dropping any bombs. A working-class area in a town in southeastern England was bombed, killing seven people, including women, adults, and a ten-year-old girl. Another town in the southeast was hit by bombs, causing considerable damage to houses, but only one person was injured. In an aerial battle over Kent and the mouth of the Thames River at noon, 18 Messerschmitt German aircraft had been shot down, and the British had lost only three aircraft. It was later discovered that two Messerschmitt aircraft, one Dornier bomber, and one Henschel army reconnaissance aircraft from Germany, as well as other enemy aircraft, had been destroyed. A Polish squadron shot down eight Messerschmitt German aircraft yesterday, and a Canadian squadron also engaged in fierce aerial combat with enemy aircraft over Kent, shooting down three Messerschmitt aircraft.

<p>London. The British Air Force did not sortie for the past two nights due to bad weather. Last night, it resumed its attack on the German-controlled Channel ports. It is reported that the British aircraft attacked very heavily. From Dunkirk to Boulogne on the French coast, there was a sea of fire. Because the cloud cover was low, the firelight reflected onto the eastern coast of England. According to observers on the cliffs, British aircraft flew across the Channel just as dusk fell. Within minutes, the explosions of bombs could be seen, and it seemed that several places had caught fire. British bombers continued to raid the Channel ports on Friday. (Reuters, 6th)</p>

<h3>Dive Bombers and the Modern Air Force; Written by German Major Brünicke; Translated by Wang Jiahua</h3>
<p>Dive bombers did not exist during the World War. Now, they occupy an important and indispensable military position in modern air warfare. They are considered one of the most important offensive weapons of the German army, capable of striking the heart of the enemy and disrupting the rear. The method of bombing by dive bombers is different from other "attack" aircraft. General heavy bombers maintain straight and level flight when dropping bombs, while dive bombers suddenly descend from high altitudes, aiming at the target with a bomb sight and releasing the bombs. At the same time, the pilot immediately turns the aircraft upward and climbs into the clouds to avoid anti-aircraft fire. The world first became aware of dive bombers during the Spanish Civil War. During the Polish campaign, dive bombers had already established great merit for the German Air Force, causing panic in the hearts of Germany's enemies and achieving the effect of defeating them without fighting. The unprecedented victory of Germany in this European war depends greatly on the air force. They have repeatedly destroyed enemy warships and transports, and annihilated their forces off the coasts of Norway, England, and France. The strong defensive positions of Belgium and the airfields of France were all destroyed by dive bombers. During the fierce fighting in Belgium, they forced the Allied Belgian, French, and British forces to retreat to Dunkirk. When German dive bombers descend rapidly from high altitudes, they emit a sharp sound that chills the heart, further breaking down the retreating Allied forces. The structure of German dive bombers is that of a single-engine aircraft, capable of bombing fixed targets such as airfields, streets, railways, and bridges, as well as mobile targets such as warships. These bombers can be single-seat or two-seat. The bombs are released by the pilot and have extremely high explosive power. One bomb landing on a road can turn it into a trap, completely disrupting traffic. During the Polish campaign, it derailed an armored train. The pilots of these dive bombers must have strong physiques, because during the dive, the speed is over 375 miles per hour. At that time, they must be clear-headed to identify the target, and their hearts and lungs must be healthy, otherwise their physical strength and spirit cannot support the pressure of the dive. Therefore, new dive bombers are equipped with air brakes that allow the pilot to adjust the speed during the dive. The weapons of dive bombers include machine guns in the front, which can be fired by the pilot. The standard German dive bomber is the "JU 87" model, which has two seats, so a machine gun is also installed in the rear to engage enemy fighters in aerial combat. The seat can rotate. The wings of this bomber are curved, making it easier for the pilot to observe. The three-bladed propeller is powered by an engine with 1,000 horsepower. Germany possesses this superior weapon.</p>
<h3>British Barrage Balloon Drifts to Sweden</h3>

<h3>Perfect British Air Defense Equipment: Impressions Gained from a Visit by Suki Du</h3>
<p>Moscow. A TASS correspondent in London, after inspecting British equipment, expressed his opinion that the establishment of this equipment has not solved the problem of defending Britain from night raids. However, one thing is clear: Britain has created an air defense system including anti-aircraft guns, barrage balloons, and fighters, which is more impressive than anything the German Air Force has encountered before. During his visit, British officers and soldiers treated him with friendliness, showed him details, and told him about the situation of the officers. It is said that the treatment of the soldiers is far better than during the last World War. (Reuters, 6th)</p>

<h3>Former French Naval Minister Appointed Ambassador to Spain</h3>
<p>Vichy. Bitterly, who once served as the French Naval Minister and opposed declaring war on Germany, has now been appointed as the Ambassador to Spain. Baroux, the original Ambassador to Spain, has been transferred to Switzerland to succeed Coulondre's post. According to news from the Swiss capital, French Deputy Prime Minister Laval and German representative Abetz decided to dismiss Coulondre after meeting in Paris. The reason for this is that Coulondre was the Ambassador to Germany at the time of the outbreak of the war and delivered France's declaration of war to the German government, so he was not welcomed by the Germans.

<h3>The United States Actively Prepares for War; Production Advances by Leaps and Bounds; Industry Absorbs Farm Workers; Steel Production Sets New Record</h3>
<p>Washington. Informed observers believe that the United States is preparing for war. Political and business experts whom reporters associate with say they expect government spending to increase further, and US production to break all records. Even if Europe calls a truce, or Britain restores itself, the current business reaction is only temporarily suppressed. America's unsettled fate, and the wars in Europe and China, and the elections about to come, are all interlinked, hence the current prosperity in the industrial world, and the consequent reduction in unemployment. In addition, there is the stability of prices, the uncertainty of profits, and the confusion of the stock market, which are also very phenomena that occur together. Government and business leaders expect the current trend in costs to lead to high tax rates, huge debt, and new regulations for running businesses. As far as the current situation is concerned, the most important meaning it contains in the long run is as follows: (1) The policies of American protectionist trade will eventually cause the United States to dominate Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea. (2) For military reasons, hundreds of millions of dollars of munitions will be contracted to factories in the central west of the Rocky Mountains, and agricultural areas that lose out in the export market will be transformed into munitions industrial areas due to munitions contracts, and farm workers will be transferred to factories. (3) The National Defense Committee feels that the needs of the United States, relying on Japan, China, and the Dutch East Indies to obtain silk, tungsten, tin, rubber and other materials, are no longer as important as before, because the committee members believe that America's recent synthetic manufacturing is quite satisfactory. As for the rate at which factories receive new orders, it has reached the highest peak in recent years. Steel production has set a new record. Textile factories have all received urgent orders from the expanded US Army. All retail industries are making profits, and those in the industrial center are satisfied. From this, one can gauge the activity in the military field. Military expenditure in the current fiscal year is 5 billion yuan, but in the subsequent five-year period, it will be expanded to 36 billion US dollars, including the cost of armaments. Under the patriotic high tone of government-controlled national defense production, there is actually a faint tone of totalitarianism, but it is masked by the clamor of preparing for war. Most people cannot discern it in their excitement. This kind of control is expected to gradually encroach on private industry. Merchants are now receiving warnings not to hoard goods needed for the national defense process. The government has announced that hoarding will not be tolerated by the government. To meet the needs of industry in 1941, the production of freight cars is also advancing by leaps and bounds, with the number of sales 20% higher than last year. More importantly, the US Defense Committee hopes to manufacture 33,000 aircraft by October of this year, including 14,000 to be sold to Britain and 11,000 fighter aircraft to be used by the US Army. At present, the rate at which the United States manufactures aircraft engines is 2,200 per month, but within ten months it will gradually increase to 3,500. These motors are all concentrated in the Ford, Pratt &amp; Whitney, Curtiss, and Wright factories. In the naval field, in addition to the 58 warships currently in service and the 130 under construction, another 201 will be ordered to achieve the two-ocean policy within three to five years. Orders at the General Motors machine gun factory, the Remington ammunition factory, and the DuPont explosives factory are expanding very rapidly. South America's foreign trade is keeping pace with domestic development. Leather and wool from Argentina, nitrates from Chile, tin from Bolivia, and magnesium from Brazil are flowing in.

<h3>Anti-Jewish Measures in Romania and Yugoslavia</h3>
<p>Bucharest. According to a communiqué issued here, Jews will no longer be allowed to purchase land in Romania. Properties belonging to Jews must be completely transferred. However, Jews may retain land within 2,000 square meters near Jewish factories, which is not subject to the above restrictions. (Haitong Telegraph, 6th)</p>
<p>Capital City of Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia promulgated a decree on Jews yesterday, stipulating that Jewish shops or other businesses are subject to the control of this decree. It also stipulates that the number of Jewish students in primary and secondary schools should be in proportion to the number of Jews. However, the children of soldiers and those serving the country are not subject to this decree. Foreign Jews are not allowed to study in Yugoslav primary and secondary schools.

<h3>British Nationals in Baltic States Prepare to Evacuate; Soviet Union Grants Special Convenience</h3>
<p>Moscow. 300 British nationals residing in the Baltic states (i.e. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) are preparing to evacuate and arrangements have been made. The Soviet authorities are willing to provide special convenience on the railways for the evacuation of British nationals, so that they can concentrate in Riga and then travel by rail to Vladivostok to transfer to British ships.

<h3>German Military Weekly Report</h3>
<p>Berlin. In the week from September 28 to October 5, naval and air battles gradually intensified. The German Air Force continues to adhere to the principles of French military strategist General Vauban, attacking troops and military targets without wasting military ammunition on civilian attacks. German aircraft bombed British seaports, factories, and roads, and attacked airfields in various places. German long-range guns shelled Dover and nearby ports. German aircraft have been very successful in attacking convoys. German aircraft all depart from their bases in Norway and France to fight. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>Berlin. The losses of British merchant ships are increasing day by day, as acknowledged by the British Admiralty. German submarines are operating more conveniently using French seaports as their bases. Lieutenant Commander Soruk's submarine sank 122,500 tons of merchant ships, and another submarine sank 82,000 tons. The British auxiliary cruiser "Highland Patriot" has also been destroyed. The German Air Force sank one armed merchant ship (10,000 tons) and destroyed six other ships, totaling 10,000 tons. A British submarine was sunk by depth charges from a German minesweeper. The British Navy's failure in Dakar has had a significant impact on British prestige. The British battleship "Barham" was hit by the French battleship "Richelieu", and the British battleship "Resolution" was also hit by a French submarine. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>Italian King Inspects Air Force</h3>
<p>Rome. Italian King Emmanuel III yesterday visited the Italian Air Force port of Guidonia accompanied by the Chief of the Air Force and others, inspected the construction of several heavy transport aircraft, bombers, dive bombers, and fighters, and watched the performance of various aircraft.

<p>Discussions on the European War (10) (9)</p>
<h3>European and American Espionage Panic</h3>
<p>The arrest of Colonel Vielle and his son Reynard, along with the Geneva publisher Mossier, proves that German plainclothes units are also active within Switzerland. Colonel Vielle, leader of the National Front of the Swiss National Socialist faction, is currently held in a prison in the Swiss capital.</p>
<p>As for Mossier, he collected intelligence for Germany in France. Mossier used his correspondents to freely interview in France, supplying intelligence to Colonel Vielle. The international highway near Zurich leading to Germany is rarely monitored, making Zurich an ideal station for relaying intelligence.</p>
<p>The headquarters for German espionage activities are located in the Swiss capital, a place that, like between 1914 and 1918, is a gathering place for diplomats from various countries, neutrals, and belligerents. There have never been so many figures appearing under the guise of "special advisors" as there are now in this small, mountain-ringed capital, where spies from all over Europe are active. One frequent visitor is General Nikolai, who has rented a long-term villa in Zurich. He is a retired German intelligence chief who is said to disagree with Hitler's political views. His specific mission is to maintain contact with French communists, inciting them to launch a peace movement to isolate Britain in a helpless situation.</p>
<p>Guisan, the Commander-in-Chief of the Swiss Army, is also a leader of the National Front. Another prominent figure is Colonel Truber, a military judge. German students in Swiss universities have also been ordered to withdraw.</p>
<p>Yugoslavia is also working hard to prevent the mass entry of National Socialist and Fascist travelers, allowing them to come openly to Yugoslavia in the capital Belgrade and Zagreb under the pretext of visiting the Belgrade Fair. A large number of travelers have now been ordered by the Yugoslav authorities to leave the country within a specified period. The Belgrade Chief of Police has established a special bureau, ordering local residents to report anyone with suspicious behavior. However, many important figures in Yugoslavia are suspected. For example, every move of the young Yugoslav monarch is only known by the police, but soon it is spread around. From this, it can be seen that someone intends to kidnap King Peter of Yugoslavia, and then restore him to the throne as a puppet.</p>
<p>Romania is most closely watched by the National Socialists. Throughout the Balkans, there are tens of thousands of people who, in name, are merchants, counselors, and journalists, but in reality, spend all or part of their time doing espionage work. The young Yugoslav monarch is in danger of being kidnapped, and the new Romanian monarch, Michael, is in a similarly unfavorable situation. The Romanian authorities have conducted house-to-house searches, ordering suspected individuals to leave the country, but tens of thousands of Germans still live secretly in Romania, and these people, as far as is known, have weapons, and many have even refused police searches. What is unknown is whether the Romanian police are strictly enforcing their duties or merely paying lip service.</p>
<p>Recently, a very noteworthy event occurred in the Balkans: several hundred young German workers arrived in Bulgaria by steamboat via the Danube. The mission of this group of young workers, according to their own statements, is to take advantage of their vacation to get a chance to rest. However, according to information obtained by reporters, these workers were transported by thirty ships, with two hundred people per ship, and concentrated in batches within Bulgaria.</p>
<p>Turkey's methods of preventing espionage are more thorough than those of other countries. Spies have fewer opportunities to operate in Turkey than in other countries. Istanbul is the most dangerous place in all of Turkey, and the authorities have searched for a large number of spies among the German expatriates. Recently, there have been 160 foreign café musicians active in Istanbul, 107 of whom are performing women from Hungary.</p>
<p>The internal affairs of espionage in Egypt are slightly different from those in other countries. When the Great War broke out last September, all Germans in Egypt were imprisoned. However, most of them were subsequently released, and many Germans, claiming to be refugees expelled by the National Socialists, were also allowed to enter the country by the Egyptian authorities. However, even more dangerous than the German plainclothes units in Egypt are the 70,000 organized Italian expatriates, under the direction of Fascist spies and under consular protection. Before Italy entered the war, these large numbers of Fascists had already been assigned their respective tasks. The Egyptian authorities are very fearful of these people carrying out internal sabotage work.</p>
<p>Former French Prime Minister Daladier ordered a search of the Soviet Trade Bureau in Paris and discovered an annotated record prepared by the German secret police, thus learning that espionage within France was extremely dangerous. The large-scale searches in Paris uncovered various espionage activities, including National Socialist spies, Fascist spies, and Soviet spies, all without exception. According to Daladier's report, France's "liberalism" and "arrogance" have always been too lenient towards foreigners, allowing spies from various countries to do as they please.</p>
<p>The unbridled chatter in French cafes yields a great deal to those who are attentive to gathering intelligence. This intelligence is generally routed through Rome to Berlin. The fact that Alois Oerbin, the former local news editor of the Paris Times, was bought off shows that Abezz, a confidant spy of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, has taken control of important figures in Paris. This group of German spies is led by Baroness Ennam, who is very beautiful and speaks many foreign languages. She specializes in promoting pro-German films and newspapers in Paris, as well as seeking out and transmitting military intelligence. France has been closely guarding against espionage since the beginning of the war. A large-scale search was once conducted in the lower classes of Paris, and several thousand people were arrested.</p>
<p>The French military vehicle area is isolated from the outside world. People in the military zone are not allowed to make telephone calls or send telegrams, or send letters, and all their actions are monitored. However, there are naturally spies in the military zone. However, according to French authorities, these spies are not a threat if they cannot get information through the cordon. Later, France also confined all German men and unmarried German women between the ages of sixteen and sixty-five in Paris. The appointment of Mantel, a confidant of the late "Tiger Premier" Clemenceau, as the French Minister of the Interior, is enough to prove that France has the greatest determination to eradicate plainclothes units. However, countless foreigners live in the suburbs of Paris, making it very difficult to clear out spies. The biggest difficulty is that non-belligerent expatriates can continue to enjoy various freedoms, and have never been subject to the slightest restraint by the French authorities.</p>

<h3>The Importance and Strategies of Promoting Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>— Wang Haibo</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks and Their Market</p>
<p>A stock is a certificate representing the ownership of investment in a company by a shareholder with limited liability in a joint-stock limited company or joint-stock partnership. Buying and selling stocks is the transfer of this ownership of investment. The origin of Chinese stocks dates back to the First European War. To this day, Chinese businesses that issue stocks include finance, tobacco, matches, printing and paper, insurance, department stores, mining, new medicines, enamelware, and public utilities, chemical industries, etc. In Shanghai alone, there are no fewer than a hundred well-known types. In the third year of the Republic (1914), the Shanghai Stock Brokers Association was established, with its office located at Wo Hing Fang, Jiujiang Road. The initial membership of the association was twelve, later increased to fifteen. Stocks listed for trading included those of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Commercial Bank, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Hanyeping Iron and Coal Company, Hankou Jiji Water and Electricity Company, and the Canton-Hankow Railway. Later, the Chinese Stock Exchange and the Shanghai Securities and Goods Exchange also began trading stocks. In June of the twenty-sixth year of the Republic (1937), the securities portion of the Securities and Goods Exchange was merged into the Chinese Securities Exchange, leaving the Chinese Securities Exchange as the only Chinese stock market. Moreover, in practice, although hundreds of types of Chinese stocks have been issued successively, only a few are publicly traded and circulated. The trading of the Chinese Securities Exchange mainly involved government bonds with favorable interest rates; stock trading could not be regarded as equally important. After the August 13th Incident, the Chinese Securities Exchange was ordered to suspend operations, and as a result, the fate of Chinese stocks was even worse than before. Looking back at foreign stocks, speculation was rampant as never before, leading to the outflow of funds and causing turmoil in the financial market, which is truly regrettable. At a time when idle capital is abundant and blind obedience is harmful, is not the reconstruction of the national stock market an urgent task?</p>
<p>Reasons for the Underdevelopment of Chinese Stocks</p>
<p>What are the reasons for the sluggish trading of Chinese stocks? After much deliberation, the author feels compelled to speak out:</p>
<p>(1) Unfavorable General Conditions: Such as China's economic backwardness, underdeveloped industries, and imperfect corporate organization. Although various companies have issued stocks, the capital of most companies is limited, and the issuance of stocks is insufficient for circulation. This is one reason. Before the Xi'an Incident, the domestic political situation was unstable; the general social situation was also constantly changing. As a result, industry and commerce were naturally difficult to develop normally, and the issuance and circulation of Chinese stocks were also restricted. This is another reason. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, Chinese industries have suffered direct and indirect destruction, and the situation remains unclear in many respects. All these unfavorable conditions are reasons for the difficulty in developing Chinese stocks.</p>
<p>(2) Weaknesses of the Companies Themselves: The unsound corporate organization in China, with its numerous weaknesses, is an undeniable fact. The most prominent of these are approximately the following five points: (1) Companies are unwilling to disclose their true situation; they deliberately make it difficult for those who inquire about the company's information, causing investors to shy away. (2) As a matter of course, before investing, investors must first analyze the balance sheet and profit and loss statement of the investee company to understand its financial and operational status, in order to compare it with other similar enterprises and companies, thereby clarifying the company's position in the enterprise organization and determining its investment policy. However, in China, most companies, although bearing the name of new enterprises, keep the accounting records that can reflect the company's financial and operational status largely secret; even if some are announced, they are brief and not detailed; and even those numbers are not necessarily the most reliable. (3) Chinese stocks are mostly held by major shareholders; the number circulating in the market is small. Those with good dividends are unwilling to sell them readily; those with meager dividends are difficult to sell. (4) It is often difficult to transfer shares held by shareholders. According to what the author knows, when a certain shareholder once sold a certain type of stock he held, other related shareholders were shocked and even wanted to convene a shareholders' meeting to deal with it. Investors who witness this phenomenon are bound to hesitate. (5) After a shareholder's transaction, if they want to transfer the shares, the company may impose difficulties due to regulations or deliberately create obstacles, making the procedures extremely cumbersome. Even if one is fortunate enough to overcome these difficulties, the transfer of stocks such as those of the Bank of Communications and Sincere Company is still far away in Chongqing and Hong Kong, requiring time to travel back and forth. Moreover, before the transfer is actually carried out, investors still face the possibility of investment risks. The quick and simple transfer of foreign stocks is something that Chinese stocks cannot match.</p>
<p>(3) Investor Hesitations: The hesitations of Chinese people towards investing in Chinese stocks can be discussed in several aspects: such as the inability to fully understand the recent financial and operational status of the companies issuing stocks, and the lack of reliable reports on the dividend situation of the company in recent years; investors naturally dare not rush to buy, this is one reason. Chinese stocks are mostly registered, and transfers must be registered; and the transfer procedures are mostly troublesome and slow; if there is any non-compliance, procedures such as publishing notices in newspapers and providing guarantees are required; this procedure, sometimes for the sake of prudence, is sometimes unnecessary in fact; but Chinese companies mostly follow the routine, which makes investors express fear of stock transactions; this is another reason. This situation is partly due to the unfavorable general social conditions, and partly due to the existence of various weaknesses in the companies themselves. Moreover, the lack of a sound public stock trading market in our country is a major concern for investors.</p>
<p>Examining the so-called securitization of fixed capital in European and American countries, the securities of fixed investments can be traded and circulated through exchanges; investors readily accept these securities because they are transferable, no less so than short-term investments. However, in China, the conditions of the financial market are not yet sound; and there is a lack of a proper stock trading market. As a result, those who hold stocks have no way to sell them; and if they want to mortgage them to financial institutions, they are often rejected. Unable to sell or mortgage, stock holders are in a dilemma, and cannot help but sigh at the uselessness of stocks! This is the situation regarding the supply of stocks. As for the demand side, there is the suffering of not knowing where to inquire. Because supply and demand cannot meet, those who hold stocks, being unable to alleviate their financial difficulties, feel as if they hold worthless items; and investors, wanting to buy, have no way to do so, and are afraid that their funds will be tied up; as a result, they are hesitant to invest in Chinese stocks; thus, social idle capital turns to speculative avenues such as foreign exchange, gold, and foreign stocks; the outflow of funds cannot be stopped; and the market is disrupted, causing even greater harm. Whose fault is this? Who can believe that it has nothing to do with China's lack of a public securities market?</p>
<p>Future Strategies</p>
<p>The securities market and the financial market are closely related; those with financial knowledge all know this. The securities market is the only place to execute securities trading and control the securities market; and the liquidity of securities trading and the rise and fall of securities prices are related to the financial market. Moreover, the government bond market and the stock market are the two cornerstones of the securities market. Now that the underdevelopment of Chinese stock trading is such, and the need for a Chinese stock market is also such, the importance of establishing a Chinese stock market goes without saying. But how can it be established under the current situation in China? This is closely related to guiding idle capital and developing legitimate industry and commerce, and we must consider and contemplate it. Here, based on what I see, I present five points:</p>
<p>(1) General: Regarding the current general situation: the international situation is becoming increasingly tense, and various domestic industries are mostly in a state of contraction in this recessionary atmosphere. Although it is difficult to guarantee that investing in stocks will be absolutely profitable; however, we can take some comfort in the fact that in the current difficult environment, many industries are still developing; matters depend on human effort, and whether investments can be profitable depends largely on the industry itself; if investors have keen eyes, investing in Chinese stocks is practically a sure thing. As we advocate Chinese stocks, we hope that investors can discard their preconceptions, and that Chinese industries are not incapable of making a difference.</p>
<p>(2) The Companies Themselves: The underdevelopment of Chinese stock trading is mostly due to the unsoundness of the companies themselves, as discussed earlier. In the future, companies themselves should improve in the following ways: (1) Strengthen internal organization, such as streamlining personnel and expanding shares, which are among the most notable. Currently, general investors pay little attention to the personnel of the companies they invest in; however, those who are well-versed in investment principles are unwilling to rashly invest in companies with incomplete personnel. Moreover, most Chinese companies have very little capital; the stocks they issue are mostly held by a small number of shareholders and rarely circulate in the market; therefore, this type of organization may consider expanding, welcoming participation from the public, so that everyone can work together. (2) Accounting records are critical; if the company seeks the trust of the outside world, and even to promote the company's stock, it should publicly announce the accounting and annual business situation, so that the outside world can understand the true situation. As for stock transfers, they should be as quick and simple as possible; unnecessary procedures can be omitted. In short: the company itself should strive to be properly adjusted; advantages should be preserved and further promoted; and disadvantages should be improved, striving for perfection. This is not only related to attracting external investment, but also to the company's own development.</p>
<p>(3) Investors: In this situation, investors should also reflect and thoroughly awaken. In recent years, those who have speculated in foreign exchange, gold, and foreign stocks have certainly made a fortune, but those who have lost their fortunes and been involved in lawsuits and imprisonment are also not uncommon. For example, in early June of this year, as the situation in Europe tightened, British stocks fell, foreign exchange rates eased, foreign banks in Shanghai saw bank runs, speculative psychology declined, and the situation in the Dutch East Indies was tense, etc., the prices of foreign stocks plummeted, and it is truly unknown how many people failed due to speculation in foreign stocks. It can be seen that investing in foreign stocks is neither absolutely safe nor absolutely profitable. Investors should now realize and reflect on this. In light of the current international situation, which is volatile and unstable, the movements of foreign companies are constantly changing; the future situation is difficult to predict; and the rubber stock craze of the early Republic is still fresh in memory. If investing in Chinese stocks, one can inquire about the actual situation of the company nearby, and supervision is also easier. This is the second thing that investors should reflect and awaken to. Moreover, investing in foreign stocks is ignorant of national responsibility; while Chinese stocks are treated as if unseen; this is also disheartening. It is not known that Chinese industry is waiting for the Chinese people to revitalize it; and investing in Chinese stocks is not merely helpful to the development of Chinese industry and commerce. As the saying goes: "If the skin is not there, what will the hair cling to?" We earnestly hope that domestic investors will appreciate this, realize it, and change their course!</p>
<p>(4) The Financial Sector: Securities and finance are closely related, so promoting Chinese stocks depends on the financial sector; and the trust industry in the financial sector cannot shirk its responsibility. According to the trust industry: there is trust investment; there is the agency for the transfer and registration of valuable securities; and there are businesses that handle the establishment of companies and the issuance of company bond trusts. All of these are closely related to a proper capital market. However, we cannot bear to speak of the current situation of our country's capital market. Therefore, promoting and popularizing Chinese stocks is not only enough to create a capital market, but also allows the trust industry itself to develop. It only depends on whether our trust industry can rise up and implement it.</p>
<p>(5) Public Opinion: In the current advocacy of Chinese stocks, the public opinion and leaders of various industries bear an important responsibility. The public opinion should introduce more of the inside situation of Chinese companies; and the leaders of various industries should invest more in Chinese industries as a guide. Once powerful people advocate, investors will surely follow; its contribution to the future of the Chinese capital market and national industries is not small.</p>
<p>Currently in Shanghai, everything is developing abnormally; as expressed in the financial market: on the one hand, hundreds of millions of idle capital flood the speculative avenues; on the other hand, legitimate industries related to the fate of the country are unable to develop due to lack of funds. The deeper the gap between these two, the greater the harm to society. Promoting Chinese stocks means on the one hand guiding idle capital to safe avenues, and on the other hand seeking to advance Chinese industry and commerce; and making the two mutually beneficial, mutually enhancing, and bringing endless blessings to society.

<p>(Author's Note) For detailed content about Chinese stocks, please refer to my article "Overview of Chinese Stocks"; which is planned to be published in the Chinese Stock Special Issue of the Practical Economics (Volume 2, Issue 10, to be published soon). The special issue also contains many papers by financial leaders and experts actually engaged in Chinese stock trading, which readers are encouraged to pay special attention to.</p>
<h3>On the Recent Rise in Public Bonds</h3>
<p>— Xiao Guanyao</p>
<p>The buying and selling of public bonds in China's financial market has been ongoing for over a decade. With the establishment of the "Shanghai Stock and Commercial Association," members began to formally gather and deal in public bonds. Subsequently, with the opening of the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, Shanghai quickly became the center of the securities market.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle, all exchanges in Shanghai were ordered by the government to cease operations. The public bond market immediately quieted down, and has not yet been officially reopened.</p>
<p>However, after the war shifted inland, under special circumstances in Shanghai, the clamor of public bond trading was once again heard in the securities exchange. However, this type of trading is no longer comparable to the bustling public market of the past, but rather takes place in a "tea house setting." Before long, this "tea house setting" also became a haven for speculators, just like the public market.</p>
<p>So, how did public bonds become an object of speculation? There are many factors involved. I will now select the most obvious and significant ones for analysis below:</p>
<p>First, if we review the pre-war prices of public bonds, the highest price for Unified Bond A was 88.20 yuan and the lowest was 76.60 yuan; Unified Bond B's highest was 86.60 yuan and the lowest was 76.60 yuan; Unified Bond C's highest was 84.80 yuan and the lowest was 74.60 yuan; Unified Bond D's highest was 83.30 yuan and the lowest was 74.00 yuan; and Unified Bond E's highest was 73.40 yuan and the lowest was 71.70 yuan. This is the record for June of the 26th year of the Republic (1937). By January of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), after the Sino-Japanese war had already broken out, their prices had fallen to rock bottom. For example, the lowest price for Unified Bond A was 42.50 yuan, Unified Bond B was 40.20 yuan, Unified Bond C was 39.80 yuan, Unified Bond D was 39.00 yuan, and Unified Bond E was 39.00 yuan. Now that China's resistance war has entered its fourth year, and confidence in victory is growing stronger daily, the current prices are still low. Taking advantage of the low prices to absorb them is not only a good consideration for the banks' reserves, but also a prime opportunity. During this period, speculators also found the demand for public bond chips far exceeding the supply, leading to a continuous rise in prices.</p>
<p>Second, today's large-scale public bond transactions are conducted using bank drafts. Unlike the pre-war practice of cash withdrawals the next day, there is now a discount on drafts. If you exchange legal tender for a bank draft and then purchase public bonds, it is quite economical. It is generally believed that after the war ends, the practice of discounting bank drafts will disappear.</p>
<p>Third, Shanghai is overflowing with idle capital, which is becoming increasingly apparent. In the past three years, Shanghai's wealthy merchants and rich families have already amassed war profits from foreign exchange restrictions, stock market activities, and the hoarding of cotton yarn and daily necessities. Recently, they have started to consider public bonds, because the underground market for public bonds has been quiet for a long time, and the international environment and the situation of the war of resistance seem to favor the prospects of public bonds. Moreover, wealthy merchants and rich families have already made a lot of money in various speculations, and have a considerable economic foundation. Today, they might as well change their tastes and invest in public bonds, and also gain the good reputation of believing in national debt. What's not to like?</p>
<p>Fourth, the optimistic outlook for public bonds is one of the reasons for the rise in prices. Furthermore, public bonds can yield more than one percent interest, which is better than bank deposit rates. Recently, banks have reduced interest rates due to the excess of idle capital in Shanghai, so it is better to increase holdings while public bonds are still low.</p>
<p>Fifth, as public bond prices rise due to increased holdings from all sides, those who borrowed chips to sell short have no choice but to change their tune and cover their short positions, further driving public bond prices higher.</p>
<p>Sixth, and with the recent tensions in Vietnam, which indicate that Japan's southward advance is becoming more urgent, the possibility of conflict between Japan and the United States and Britain in the Pacific is getting closer. Rumors of a meeting between China, the Soviet Union, and the United States to stabilize the situation in the Far East are rampant. Therefore, despite the tensions in Vietnam, the extent of the rise in public bonds has not diminished.</p>
<p>Seventh, the United States' approval of a $25 million loan to China to maintain foreign exchange has been explained by Mr. Jones, director of the American Construction Bank Corporation, and confirmed by officials. This is of great help in international balance of payments. Moreover, the success of the loan reflects the soundness of China's financial credit, its good international standing, and the increasingly favorable prospects for the war. Therefore, people are encouraged, the market is stable, and there is no doubt that the underground market for public bonds is unifying, and various bonds are firmly rising.</p>
<p>For these reasons, it should not be said that the recent public bonds, such as Unified Bond A, which has reached a high of 65.55 yuan, Unified Bond B, which has reached 59.00 yuan, Unified Bond C, which has reached 56.95 yuan, Unified Bond D, which has reached 55.10 yuan, and Unified Bond E, which has reached 56.33 yuan (market prices on September 10), have reached new post-war peaks for no reason.</p>
<p>When we look at the recent rise in public bonds, we can understand how it reflects China's politics, military affairs, economy, and finance.</p>
<h3>Our Country's Wartime Finance</h3>
<p>— Yu XieLin</p>
<p>The war of resistance has lasted for more than three years. It is difficult to resist the war and build the country at the same time, and the needs are exceptionally vast, but we can still cope with ease, and the finance is still stable. Is this not because of the transformation of our country's finance? Minister of Finance Kong stated in two articles, "Finance and Finance in the Three Years of the War of Resistance," published on the July 7th anniversary: "In terms of taxation, although there have been improvements in the three years of the War of Resistance, the burden on the general public has not increased; in terms of public debt, the issuance has not exceeded the limit, and credit can still be maintained; in terms of legal tender, the reserves are sufficient and the credit is as stable as ever." The main reasons why we can do this are five: (1) There were appropriate arrangements before the war; (2) wartime measures were appropriate; (3) our country is based on agriculture, and the economic foundation lies in the countryside. In the past three years, there have been consecutive good harvests, which is of great benefit to the people; (4) compatriots at home and abroad have actively donated; (5) friendly countries have shown sympathy and assistance. Based on these reasons, our country's wartime finance can cope with ease.</p>
<p>In the past three years, the financial system has been greatly improved, so that our finance is gradually becoming more rationalized, and the policies that have been decided but not implemented in the past few years can also be implemented in this short period of time. The author will make a brief review of the policies implemented by the financial authorities in the past three years.</p>
<p>Financial Reform Before the War</p>
<p>When the war started, our country's finance was able to respond stably, which was beyond everyone's expectations. This should be attributed to the preparations before the war.</p>
<p>(1) Financial unification had considerable progress before the war. The authorities have made significant achievements in the unification and improvement of financial and administrative powers. Therefore, when the war broke out, the financial authorities were able to cope.</p>
<p>(2) Abolishing harsh and miscellaneous taxes to cultivate the people's strength. In the past, our country's local tax system was extremely chaotic, with numerous harsh taxes and miscellaneous taxes, and arbitrary extortion was used to seek private gain. This was extremely harmful to the country and the people. Therefore, after the Second National Financial Conference, the authorities actively promoted the abolition of harsh and miscellaneous taxes. In the past few years, significant achievements have been made. In this way, on the one hand, the burden on the people has been relieved, and on the other hand, the local wealth has been cultivated, so that the national economy is becoming more prosperous.</p>
<p>(3) Introducing new taxes to meet wartime needs. Our country's taxes are mainly based on the three taxes of customs, salt, and tobacco. However, these indirect taxes are all biased towards the coastal provinces. Once they are lost, tax revenue will have no source. The authorities, seeing this, introduced income tax. Therefore, income tax can continue to be levied during wartime to pay for wartime needs, and the people will not complain about the increase in taxation, because the burden is fair.</p>
<p>(4) Reorganizing public debt and restoring national credit. As for domestic debt, there are many items, different interest rates, and short terms, which increase our country's financial burden, making it difficult to balance our country's budget. Therefore, at the beginning of the 25th year (1936), it was thoroughly reorganized, and more than 30 separate domestic debts were merged into five unified public debts, the terms were extended, and the interest rates were unified, so that the annual financial burden could be reduced by a huge amount. As for foreign debt, it is also actively reorganized. Therefore, in the months before the war, the market prices of domestic and foreign debts all reached satisfactory levels.</p>
<p>(5) Reforming currency to unify the national currency system. The success of currency reform is the greatest achievement of our country's financial authorities. The implementation of the legal tender system can centralize issuance, strengthen banks, stabilize finance, and promote the balance of the national budget. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Financial Commentary</h3>
<p>— Sheng Kaiqiong</p>
<p>—October 5—</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Domei News Agency, American commercial banks will refuse to sell US currency to the public. Although it does not explicitly refer to Japanese merchants, according to financial circles, it is certainly targeting them, as it happened to occur after Germany, Italy, and Japan concluded a military and economic alliance. According to reports, the restrictions imposed by American commercial banks do not apply to spot goods, but to forward contracts. Furthermore, this restriction is not exclusively for Japanese merchants, but is often general. Moreover, this restriction is not a single action taken by American commercial banks, but a joint action taken by other banks.</p>
<p>Although the restriction on forward exchange transactions is not aimed at Japan, its cause is actually due to the changing history of Japan's foreign policy. Because Japan and Germany and Italy have concluded the Tripartite Pact, the foreign commercial banks in Shanghai are deeply concerned that the result of Japan's involvement in the European war may prevent the Shanghai branch of Japanese commercial banks from fulfilling its contractual obligations to other foreign commercial banks, and suffer losses. Therefore, as a precaution, foreign commercial banks that have dealings with Japanese commercial banks want to settle the October forward exchange sold by Japanese commercial banks as soon as possible. According to Shanghai's foreign exchange market practice, October futures transactions can originally be settled by the end of October, but the current international situation is changing daily, and transactions between banks of different nationalities are becoming more and more dangerous. Therefore, for the October foreign exchange sold by Japanese commercial banks, it is of course better to settle it in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Because this restriction is entirely to prevent unfavorable changes in the international situation, forward transactions between banks of the same nationality, or forward transactions between banks with the same position, can of course continue as usual without obstruction. Therefore, the Shanghai foreign exchange market is not affected. However, after this restriction is in place, speculative transactions on the market that are not derived from commercial needs will be subject to some restrictions. This is unfavorable to speculators, but it removes some of the disruptive forces from the foreign exchange market, making it beneficial. (End)</p>
<h3>After the Reduction of Interest on Current Accounts, Everyone is Changing to Fixed Deposits, a Good Strategy for Consolidating Idle Capital</h3>
<p>Since October 1, commercial banks in the city have implemented a reduction of one percent in the interest rates on current savings and current deposits, that is, from the original four percent to three percent. After the outbreak of the war, various banks converted most of their fixed deposits into current deposits due to the difficulty of using funds, and had long planned to do so. Recently, a large amount of idle capital has flowed in from Hong Kong and other places, and the current deposits of various banks have increased daily. At the same time, the total average daily amount of exchange deposits and interbank deposits in the bank clearinghouse, from 39,154,849.74 yuan in August of the 28th year (1939), increased to 111,094,140.036 yuan in July of this year, and 154,427,650.87 yuan in August, setting a new record for deposits in the association. The amount increased by 115,272,802.13 yuan compared with August of last year. Therefore, the various banks reduced the interest on current accounts, and decided to implement it in advance on October 1. However, before the implementation, the various banks rushed to do night work to send out notices of interest rate reductions to depositors, and sent out the letters before October 1. The interest calculated by the bank for the depositors is still based on December 10 as the date of interest payment. However, the interest rate is for one period from June 21 to September 30, and another period from October 1 to December 20 (calculated according to the interest rate reduction). This is the first time that banks have implemented a reduction in current interest rates, but since the implementation of the reduction in current interest rates, many general depositors have changed from current to fixed deposits after October 1 due to the reduction in current interest rates. Therefore, this reduction in current deposits benefits both banks and depositors. On the bank side, changing from current to fixed deposits can allow a part of the funds to be used, because there were too many current deposits before, and they did not dare to use them. If rumors were to occur, everyone would need to withdraw all of their current deposits immediately. On the depositor side, changing from current deposits to fixed deposits due to the reduction in current interest rates can instead obtain greater interest. Therefore, reducing current interest rates can be said to transfer idle capital to fixed capital, and can also suppress speculative techniques. (Yu)</p>
<h3>Pound Sterling Falls Back, Indian Silver Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>New York, 5th: In the foreign exchange market, the pound sterling has stabilized. It opened in the morning at a low price of $4.035, and later rose to $4.04, and finally closed at $4.0375, slightly down 2.5 points from yesterday.</p>
<p>Bombay, 5th: The silver market is stable, and current prices rose by 2 annas. 25 contracts were traded. The British and American silver markets were closed, and there was no telegram.</p>
<h3>Newly Harvested Longan, in Small Quantities</h3>
<p>Although newly harvested longan have appeared in various producing areas, the lack of shipping has led to a lack of goods. It is reported that the first trial voyage in the Fuzhou-Qing area has brought dozens of loads of new goods, but they are a drop in the bucket, not enough to distribute, but better than nothing.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Easing</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was still soft, and transactions were extremely quiet. The association split the market. The spot price of No. 24 coarse white foreign warehouse goods was still 77.5 yuan, and Dutch red warehouse goods were 60 yuan, with little fluctuation. Taikoo car white B mark was 75.2 yuan, and small triangle, lower grade DY mark was 73 yuan, with the same decline. There were few other transactions.</p>
<h3>Local Nails Rise Again</h3>
<p>The price of local factory yuan nails has been rising sharply recently. This is because actual sales have started, and the price of raw materials (wire rods) has also skyrocketed, so the price of local nails has also had to rise sharply. Therefore, yesterday the market price had risen to as high as 60 yuan and 58-59 yuan, an increase of 2-3 yuan from the previous market. Yesterday, due to the weekend, only retail buyers made occasional purchases.</p>
<h3>Broad Market for Woolen Fabrics in Late Autumn</h3>
<p>As it is late autumn and the weather is getting colder, the market for woolen fabrics is expanding. Customers from Hong Kong, Qingdao, Changsha, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and other ports are all trying to transport and sell them. Yellow and grass green flannels are selling well, and transactions are not weak. The needs of local street merchants, Western clothing merchants, shoe and hat merchants, used goods merchants, female clothing merchants, workshops, etc. are all quite urgent, leading to strong transactions in tweed, riding breeches cloth, Harris tweed, flannel, medium-thick serge, homespun, thick flannel, overcoat flannel, dark black Western suit flannel, long-haired flannel, mohair flannel, short-haired flannel, tiger flannel, etc. The market is very good, and standard market prices have all turned from weak to rising.</p>

<h3>Establishing a Far East Policy, America's Large Sum of Money is a Factual Response, Japan's Empty Threats Cannot Help the Situation, Woodrow Wyatt Elaborates on the Consequences of Konoe's Remarks</h3>
<p>British well-known commentator Woodrow Wyatt published a commentary in the English-language North China Daily News yesterday, saying that if Japanese Prime Minister Konoe's statement to reporters in Kyoto truly represents his final words, then war between the United States and Japan must be considered unavoidable. Konoe said that the war or peace in the Pacific depends on the extent to which Japan and the United States respect each other's interests in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. The United States must express proper understanding and sympathy for Japan's position in the East as a prerequisite for cooperation. If the United States still refuses to do so, and regards the Tripartite Pact as a hostile act, then there is only war. Konoe also said that Japan will induce the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States to end their aid to Chongqing.</p>
<p>Cooperation Between the US and Japan is Impossible</p>
<p>Since Japan announced its plan to build a "New Order in East Asia" and expanded it to a "Greater East Asia," the United States has already expressed its attitude, because the United States understands the intention of this "New Order," so it does not sympathize with it at all. Not only does it not recognize it, but it will do everything in its power to continue to prevent the completion of Japan's plan. Various threats, whether from Japan or any other party, cannot hope to change the United States' Far East policy, make it recognize Japan's "New Order," and cooperate with it in construction. When Konoe refers to "the prerequisite for cooperation," what he refers to is contrary to the United States' policy, so this kind of cooperation is impossible to achieve.</p>
<p>American Policy is Not Subject to Threats</p>
<p>The United States' initial limited "New Order in East Asia" plan was met with the cancellation of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation as a concrete expression of opposition. After the publication of Japan's more ambitious "Greater East Asia New Order" plan, what followed was the United States' first serious retaliatory action. If Konoe and his colleagues believe that the empty threats from Tokyo (or Berlin or Rome) are enough to change the United States' basic policy, then their ignorance is also pitiful, because the Roosevelt government or any other American president's government will never adopt a policy that the majority of Americans believe is disloyal to China or disloyal to democratic countries.</p>
<p>Lending Huge Sums to China is a Fact First</p>
<p>All current evidence indicates that the American people and officials have unanimously decided not to cooperate with Japan on its current East Asia policy. As for Japan's desire to induce other countries, including the United States, to "end aid to Chongqing," this attempt has been answered in advance by the $25 million US loan to China a few days ago. Can a clever politician like Konoe really believe that Japan's protests are enough to cancel the United States' guarantee of aid to China?</p>
<p>Japan Dares Not Criticize the Soviet Union</p>
<p>In the past, if Britain and the United States had actions to aid Chongqing, they would be the object of criticism, but there is no mention of Soviet Russia's aid to China. There is indeed an important significance in this. Soviet Russia's aid to China has never been interrupted, even after the Dian-Viet Railway and the Burma Road were blocked, it continued as usual, and the scope of military equipment included is greater than the assistance provided by Britain and the United States. A few days ago, Japan made a statement that it does not oppose the Soviet Union's aid to China. This is indeed an interesting explanation. In fact, although Japan can take advantage of the collapse of France and the troubles of Britain in Europe to take advantage of others' misfortunes, it dares not make any protests to Moscow in order to ask for trouble.</p>
<p>Japan Tries to Reduce Conflicts with the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Japan is enraged even by the goods and livestock that Britain and the United States supply to China that are not military necessities, but it is trying to avoid friction with Soviet Russia with regard to Moscow's continuous supply of military equipment to Chongqing. This is indeed the most powerful confession of Japan's political opportunism. Judging from Konoe's remarks this time, Russia does not seem to need to be considered when discussing the issue of peace and war in the Pacific. Although the recent Tripartite Pact "does not contain the meaning of compromise with communism, it hopes to minimize the sources of conflict between the Soviet Union and Japan." Stalin's policy has always been aimed at creating chaos in the world, while he stays out of the matter. It is certainly not impossible for him to express friendship to both China and Japan at the same time, but if Japan forgets that Soviet Russia may re-present its territorial demands in the Far East if it comes into conflict with Britain and the United States, then it will be clear that it is acting rashly.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Japanese Yarn Factories Suffer From Embargoes, Will Reduce Working Hours Until Raw Materials are Exhausted</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese side, by means of special forces, monopolized shipping and blockaded coastal ports, various Chinese merchant factories in the city, due to the lack of continued supply of raw materials and the difficulty of transporting internal sales, were once forced to stop work one after another. Among them, the most affected was the textile industry. Although the main factories in the city have gradually moved to the interior, the yarn and cloth industry, due to the large scale of the factories and the more abundant capital, still rely on Shanghai as the center, and the supply of various inland needs also mostly depends on the city's supply. Later, traffic at various ports was slightly restored after the foreign shipping companies repeatedly negotiated, and the various Chinese merchant yarn factories also resumed day and night work. However, good times did not last long. Recently, various ports have been blockaded again, and transportation has been interrupted as a result. In addition, raw material inventories are about to run out, and it will be forced to reduce working hours again. However, the serious blow suffered by the Japanese yarn factories in the city recently has exceeded that of the Chinese yarn factories. Since the United States' decision to implement an embargo on Japan, the Japanese yarn factories in Shanghai, initially with sufficient raw material inventories, were still able to barely maintain operations. Now, they are gradually showing signs of panic. Because after the Japanese side suffered the embargo, the source of raw materials is scarce, and it is difficult to continue. It is reported that the leaders of the Japanese yarn factories in the city recently exchanged opinions a few days ago, and all agreed that in this difficult period, those who can barely maintain operations should continue to work. They will never stop work until the stored raw materials are exhausted.</p>
<h3>Gunshots in Xujiahui, Japanese Military Police Sniper, Searched Afterwards, Found Nothing</h3>
<p>At about 10:00 a.m. yesterday, more than a dozen gunshots suddenly rang out near the Catholic Church in the Xujiahui refugee area. For a time, the residents nearby did not know the truth and were shocked. Afterwards, reporters from the News Agency learned that at that time, a military policeman from the Astronomical Observatory branch of the Miura Military Police Team was ordered to patrol the area on a bicycle. When the military policeman arrived in front of the Xujiahui Church, a man in a black gown suddenly jumped out from the side of the road, pulled out a pistol, and fired at the military policeman. At that time, four shots were fired in succession. One shot hit the military policeman's left arm. After being wounded, the military policeman quickly jumped off the bicycle and fired back. For a time, there was a loud burst of gunfire. Both sides fired more than a dozen shots. When passers-by heard the gunshots, they rushed to escape in shock. As a result, the man who fired the gun did not dare to linger, abandoned the gun in the bamboo fence on the side of the road, and fled without a trace. At that time, the Astronomical Observatory Military Police Corps had already received the news, and urgently sent a large team of military police to the scene to guard and search the area, but found nothing. They then took the wounded Japanese military policeman to the hospital for treatment. The Japanese side is now paying close attention to the case.</p>
<h3>Local Cold Weather Clothing Fundraiser: National Day Universal Donations; Stores and Factories Unanimously Hold Sales; Individuals Also Contribute One Day's Earnings</h3>
<p>Since the National Cold Weather Clothing Collection General Association initiated this year's cold weather clothing drive, all parts of the country have responded and promoted it successively. The Shanghai cold weather clothing fundraising is being organized and managed by the Shanghai Committee for Collecting Comfort Funds, and in accordance with the precedent of collecting spring gifts for comforting the troops, the fundraising is being promoted to all sectors, with quotas assigned separately. The Shanghai citizens, living in deep water and scorching fire, are all able to deeply understand the great righteousness and enthusiastically donate. However, the fundraising has been underway for two months, and the funds remitted by various sectors are still insufficient.</p>
<p>National Day Donation Movement</p>
<p>Because the association believes that in the past, Shanghai's various sectors have always been the best in the country for various donations and charitable acts, in order to promote achievements surpassing the national level, in addition to soliciting donations from various industry associations, schools, and organizations, it has also set from National Day to the 17th to promote National Day Cold Weather Clothing Donation Week, hoping that all companies, stores, factories, etc. in the city will take turns to hold charity sales for one week, and strive to implement them universally. As for individuals, the minimum is to contribute one day's income to the cold weather clothing donation. It is hoped that all sectors will uniformly organize at that time, and remit all the proceeds to the bank or newspaper office to be submitted to the central government to express respect, in order to reach one million.</p>
<p>Uniform Regulations and Concerted Efforts</p>
<p>The association's public announcement of the regulations for donating cold weather clothing funds during National Week is as follows: (1) In order to universally solicit donations and increase the amount of cold weather clothing funds, a National Day Cold Weather Clothing Donation Week will be held to make effective universal donations. (2) In addition to the amount of donations promoted by the fundraising association to various industries, it is hoped that compatriots from all walks of life will automatically do their best to donate one day's or several days' income to donate cold weather clothing funds. (3) All large and small companies, stores, and factories, in addition to their responsibilities in various industry associations, are also hoped to hold charity sales for one day or several days to donate cold weather clothing funds. (4) The National Day Cold Weather Clothing Donation Week will be held from the 10th to the 17th, and major companies, stores, and factories may take turns to hold it. (5) All companies, stores, and firms opened by Chinese people should remit all the proceeds from at least one day of charity sales to meet the needs of preparing cold weather clothing.</p>
<p>Voluntary Donations to Fulfill the Mission</p>
<p>It is hoped that the leaders of all sectors and the organizers of industry, commerce, and academia will actively and universally donate voluntarily from the Double Tenth Festival to fulfill the responsibilities of citizens and complete the mission of the times. In addition, the association has been ordered to close on schedule, so in addition to repeatedly sending letters to various public associations, schools, and organizations to urge them, it is also hoped that all sectors will remit them early and not delay them again to avoid delaying the needs of the war of resistance. The receipts, stubs, and fundraising reports provided to all sectors will be recovered and checked after the closure in order to issue awards to various donating organizations and submit them to the government for special commendation as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Stabilizing Food Prices: Discussions Reach a Conclusion; Foreign Rice Prices and Exchange Rates Drop; Restrictions on Domestic Rice Shipments to Shanghai Gradually Relax</h3>
<p>The entire food issue in Shanghai has been gradually stabilizing recently due to the smooth flow of sources and the weakening of public sentiment. According to sources, the authorities of the two concessions have been quite busy recently with repeated consultations on the issue of stabilizing food prices, and will take the same steps to implement them. The results of the consultations have reportedly yielded clues, and the date of implementation is not far off. It is expected that the entire food panic will be solved easily, rice prices at all levels are expected to fall, and speculators will suffer severe blows at lightning speed. It is heard that the authorities of the two concessions, based on past experience, believe that in order to stabilize the rice market, it is first necessary to dredge domestic and foreign rice sources, increase rice inventory, crack down on illegal transactions in the rice market, and strictly stipulate market regulations for the rice business. Therefore, the two authorities will proceed simultaneously on the above points.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice Pricing</p>
<p>Currently, due to the sudden changes in the international situation, the sharp drop in gold prices, and the continued easing of foreign exchange rates, the production price of foreign rice has followed suit, with the transaction price per bag reaching only about 77 yuan. Various parties are taking the opportunity to order in large quantities. According to estimates in the rice industry, the number of rice ordered this time has reached more than 150,000 bags. The huge amount of foreign rice has been loaded onto French postal ships and other ships and shipped to Shanghai, and is expected to arrive in port and enter the warehouse in the middle of this month. It is learned that most of the rice ordered this time is Grade 1 tribute rice. According to the current daily consumption in Shanghai, the foreign rice is sufficient to supply the city for ten days.</p>
<p>Domestic Rice Production</p>
<p>The rice production areas in various parts of the country, including Kunshan, Wuxi, Suzhou, Changshu, Jiaxing, Changzhou, Jiujiang, and Jiabi, have improved recently, but the quantity is still limited. Therefore, the amount of rice shipped to Shanghai is not as abundant as before the war. According to news from the rice industry in Shanghai yesterday, once the rice harvest in various places is underway, the amount of domestic rice shipped to Shanghai will continue to increase. In addition, the Rice Evaluation Association reported that within this week, the rice inventory in Shanghai is still about the same as last week. The amount of rice sold in rice shops and stored by citizens is estimated to be about 300,000 bags (because the amount of rice stored in rice shops has increased). Therefore, Shanghai's rice reserves are over one million bags, with extremely abundant inventory.</p>
<h3>Reducing Interest Rates Cannot Eliminate the Crisis; Bank Funds Shift Inward; Maximize the Economic Capacity of Each Bank; Adopt a Conservative Policy for Shanghai</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Industrial, Shanghai, China &amp; South Sea, Jin Cheng, Continental, Salt Industry, and other banks have successively reduced the interest rates on current deposits. It is learned that this is due to the sharp increase in current deposits in various banks after the war, accounting for 70% of the total deposits, and the lack of corresponding investment channels, resulting in</p>
<p>Excessive funds and difficulty in utilization. In order to avoid wasting interest rates, it is necessary to adopt interest rate reduction measures. Society is divided in its praise and criticism. It is heard that after repeated consideration, various banks believe that reducing current deposit interest rates cannot eliminate the current crisis in the Shanghai banking industry. A solution to the funds should be sought as soon as possible, namely the inward shift of funds. The construction of the interior is developing rapidly and requires funds. The inward shift of funds can complete the</p>
<p>mission of resisting Japanese aggression and building the nation. A conservative policy should be adopted for Shanghai. Industrial and commercial loans should be carefully examined, and loans that would promote hoarding should be rejected. The operation of real estate construction should also be limited, and it should be conducted in accordance with the regulations of the Provisional Measures for Managing Banks, and shall not be directly operated, commercially or by stacking goods, and shall not be operated by the name of an agency department, trade department, or trust department. The direct operation of businesses by bank employees should be strictly prohibited. However, the operation of small money shops, the handling of remittances, discounts, and the trading of gold and silver, which are found to be inconsistent with government laws and regulations, should be effectively sanctioned by the government.</p>
<h3>Shao Xubai: Memorial Service Held Yesterday, Over 500 People Including Yu Qiaqing Attended; Central Government Officials Sent Eulogies</h3>

In addition, there were many wreaths sent by industry, commerce, academia, and the press, which cannot be recorded in detail.</p>
<h3>YMCA Collects Winter Clothes for the Poor to Avoid Freezing</h3>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA, in view of the fact that every winter, the general poor people in Shanghai suffer from hunger and cold, which is extremely pitiful, has initiated a method of collecting winter clothes for the poor in Shanghai. The draft of the method is excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>Origin</p>
<p>It is found that every winter in Shanghai, there are many poor people, women, and children, crying for hunger and suffering from the threat of death, which is extremely pitiful. It is estimated that this winter, in the midst of this high tide of life, the miserable situation will be even more severe. The Association is planning to collect a large number of cotton clothes and quilts from all sectors of society in advance for cleaning and storage, so that they can be distributed at the height of winter.

<h3>The Lema Ship Sails to Dinghai; The Taishang Ship Sails to Hong Kong; the Shanghai-Ningbo Journey Arrives After Multiple Transfers</h3>
<p>Jardine Matheson's Taishang ship, which returned from Hong Kong, has been here for five days. It was originally intended to sail to Tianjin, but then a telegram came from the Hong Kong head office canceling the northbound flight, so it still sailed to Hong Kong. Also, because the ship was slightly damaged, it has been docked for repairs. It is expected to be repaired this afternoon and sail south tomorrow morning. After arriving in Hong Kong, it will decide what to do based on the situation.</p>
<p>After the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping route was cut off, the Shanghai-Dinghai (Dinghai) shipping route is now accessible.

<h3>French Concession Water and Electricity Workers' Strike: Labor and Management Both Hope for a Quick Resolution; Both Sides Observe That It Can Be Resolved This Week</h3>
<p>The French Concession Water and Electricity Company's labor strike has continued to a stalemate until yesterday, and there is no sign of breaking the deadlock. Although the labor side has appealed to the Chinese directors of the Public Works Department, Yu Qiaqing and others, to act as mediators, the points of contention have not been close, making mediation difficult for a while. Yesterday, the labor side stated that the company's general manager, FaFeiLai, greatly agreed with the statement that the labor strike would be resolved this week, because he also believed that the protracted strike could find a solution next week. However, the prerequisite for resolving this strike is that the capital side must answer the six preconditions previously raised by the labor side and dismiss the ticket drivers temporarily hired after the strike. It is also learned that at 9 pm on the 4th, a Western police officer, accompanied by three ticket sellers, went to the home of Shen Zijin, No. 242 ticket seller of the company at No. 20 Xingye Lane, Xujiahui. Just as Shen and his wife were out, the Western police officer took a photo of Shen with him for unknown reasons.</p>

<h3>Robbers Pose as Customers and Rob Expensive Leather Goods; Four Robbers Open a Room at the Yangtze Hotel; They Choose a Large Batch of Leather Goods from Da Jicheng; They Ask for it to Be Delivered to the Hotel but it Is Swept Away and Escaped</h3>
<p>At about 2:00 pm yesterday, four robbers went to the Yangtze Hotel on Sanma Road and wanted to open a room. The hotel staff led them to room 430 on the fourth floor. The tea boy brought out a registration book and asked them to sign. One of the robbers wrote the name Zheng Zhen in the book and prepaid 15 yuan for the room.</p>
<p>Purchase of Leather Goods</p>
<p>A little later, two people went out to Da Jicheng Leather Goods Store at No. 347 Henan Road and selected leather goods worth more than 33,000 yuan. After the clerks wrapped them up, one of the robbers suddenly said that he did not have enough money with him and asked the store to send someone to the Yangtze Hotel to get the money. The store staff saw that the two robbers were dressed neatly, like upper-class people, and did not suspect anything else. They sent two staff members, Zhang and Yan, at about 5:00 pm with the leather goods selected by the two robbers to the Yangtze Hotel.</p>
<p>Detaining Employees</p>
<p>Entering the room, one of the robbers locked the door. The two robbers who remained in the room took out pistols and threatened them. The two employees saw the pistols and did not dare to resist. They listened to their instructions. The robbers took out the ropes and cotton that had been prepared in advance, tied the two employees to the chairs, and stuffed their mouths with cotton. The robbers said to them, "Don't make a sound, or we will kill you."</p>
<p>Swept Away and Escaped</p>
<p>After saying that, the four robbers left one after another, locked the door, took the elevator downstairs, and left. Later, the two employees in the room remained silent for a long time. They kicked over the table in the room with their feet. The glass on the table and the teapot fell to the ground. The tea boy was very surprised when he heard the sound and went to knock on the door, but there was no response. He managed to open the door and untied the ropes of the two employees and took the cotton out of their mouths. After asking the reason, he reported it to the accounting room and then to the police station. Detectives were sent to investigate. Later, the two employees were taken to the police station for questioning to facilitate the investigation.</p>
<h3>Truck Causes Disaster: Crushing Death; Overtaking a Car; Shi Xiangsheng Crushed to Death</h3>
<p>Shi Xiangsheng, a 19-year-old young man from Pudong who worked for the Japanese-owned Xieji Transport Department at No. 88 Nanjing Road, was riding his bicycle on the Avenue Edward VII on the afternoon of the 5th at about 3:00 pm, heading east to west. When he was near Dongzilaikou Street, a truck F2340 driven by driver Li Jinbiao (45 years old, from Jiangbei, living at No. 267 Junyou Lane, Binlang Road) came speeding from the same direction behind him. Shi's car was in front and did not notice the truck behind him. Li overtook forward, and the driver accidentally knocked Shi's bicycle over. Shi's body fell outward, causing his waist to be crushed by the left rear wheel of the truck, causing extremely serious injuries. He immediately fell unconscious. The police arrived and detained Li and the truck and sent the injured person to Guangci Hospital. Because the injury was critical, he died at 4:00 pm. The police sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall autopsy room and sent detectives to investigate the family of the deceased. Yesterday was a weekly holiday, and the prosecutor's office of the Second Special Court will be requested to send someone to examine the body today. The defendant's negligence was serious, causing a tragic death. The police will also send him to the court for questioning after the autopsy. It is heard that the insurance company will be responsible for compensating for the damage, but the defendant cannot escape criminal liability.</p>

<p>Yang Wu, a woman from Shaoxing living in Dean Lane, Pentang Lane, North Fujian Road, had a 21-year-old eldest daughter, Zhu Feng, who recently worked as a female tea server in the gaming hall of the Great World. Between September 16th, she colluded with her lover, Gu A Jin, and sold her 12-year-old sister, A Qun, for 150 yuan through Zhou Yu, an old woman from Suzhou living at No. 164 Yunnan Road, as a goddaughter to a fugitive woman named Wang A Zhen. When the case was discovered, Chinese and foreign detectives from the Public Works Department arrested Yang Zhufeng and Zhou Yu and sent them to the First Special Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, said that the elder sister's selling of her younger sister was extremely vicious and requested that she be severely punished. During the adjournment, the buyer, Wang A Zhen, saw the news in the newspaper and, in a hurry, sent the girl A Cui back with an old man. The interrogation of the case was completed and was awaiting judgment. Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the court and sentenced Yang Zhufeng to one year and six months of imprisonment, and Zhou Yu to one year and six months of imprisonment, with a four-year suspended sentence.</p>

<p>At 5:15 am yesterday, the Central Police Station of the Public Concession sent a Chinese police officer to patrol the Yuanmingyuan Road area. When the police officer arrived there, he saw a petty thief stealing outside a residence. He stepped forward to stop him and tried to arrest him. The thief knew that he was in trouble and ran away. The police officer shouted to stop, but the thief did not listen. He fired a warning shot, firing four shots in a row, but all of them were dodged. As a result, the thief was still captured by the police officer and sent to the police station. When the police officer fired, a stray bullet injured a pedestrian, Dong Qingshan (20 years old), in the leg. He was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment by ambulance.</p>
<h3>Robbers with Guns Wound a Housewife</h3>

Afterwards, the patrolman arrived and summoned an ambulance to send her to Shanghai East Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Tongren Fuyuan Hall Report</h3>

<h3>Stabilization Fund: Maintains Shanghai's Black Market Exchange Rate; Makes Every Effort to Protect the Interests of Legal Merchants; Supplies Foreign Exchange for Necessary Goods as Much as Possible</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the US$25 million loan between China and the United States, the funds of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee have become more substantial. Now, in order to protect the interests of legal merchants and prevent them from suffering losses in the black market, in addition to fully stabilizing the legal exchange rate, it is also cooperating with British and American banks to maintain the Shanghai black market exchange rate and severely crack down on foreign exchange speculation. All kinds of convenience will be given to the import of goods that meet the needs of national and ethnic life. You can apply to the Foreign Exchange Allocation Review Committee for foreign exchange in accordance with the law, and the four banks of China, China, Transportation, and Agriculture will be responsible for it. However, the applicant should first fill in the application form with the name, quantity, price, import, and distribution location of the goods purchased, and submit the supporting documents to the Review Committee for review. However, restrictions must be imposed on imported goods that are not necessary for the war of resistance and goods manufactured in Japan. In short, China will continue to encourage imported goods, such as reducing tariffs on essential goods. As for the import of non-essential goods, it is equivalent to helping the escape of funds and facilitating the Japanese to obtain foreign exchange. The Japanese often transport Japanese goods to the occupied areas, easily obtain legal tender, and then use legal tender to buy foreign exchange. But China does not want to close its doors and still plans to carry out international trade. Regarding Shanghai's foreign exchange black market, since British and American banks stopped selling forward foreign exchange and foreign exchange swaps, speculation will inevitably gradually subside, and the entire foreign exchange black market will be sustainably stabilized.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb Fenghua Again</h3>
<p>According to reliable information from the aviation industry, at 9:02 am on the 5th, two Japanese planes were discovered again in Xikou, and there were four planes over Fenghua. Ningbo issued an emergency air raid alarm at 9:12 am. The Japanese planes circled over the urban area of Fenghua for a long time, and dropped 13 bombs successively.

Four people were injured, and one bomb landed at two locations in ××. A total of 31 buildings and 19 houses were destroyed, and 10 buildings and 25 houses were damaged. The Japanese planes then swept over Ningbo and invaded Cixi, heading towards Longshan and Guanhaiwei. At 4:20 pm, Ningbo issued the fourth air raid alert. The Japanese planes passed through Lingshan Northeast and Southeast, and after circling in the skies over Yuyao and Ningbo, they scattered absurd leaflets. The planes then turned back from Yuyao to Lingshan and Lihai, and went north through Baiguan. The alert was lifted at 4:54 pm.</p>
<h3>Czech Swindle</h3>
<p>A Czech man, Han Liexing Qu, between July 17th and 22nd of this year, while at the Swina Food Company at 119 Nanjing Road, fraudulently claimed to Alice that he had two to three hundred pounds of cream, asking Alice, the owner of the company, to sell it. Alice believed him and stated to Han Liexing Qu that he was willing to buy it, and paid a deposit of 564 yuan. Unexpectedly, after Han Liexing Qu received the money, he disappeared. Alice reported the case to the police. It was not until the other day that it was discovered that Han Liexing Qu was hiding in the Naval YMCA on Sichuan Road. The detectives were ordered to arrest him at that address. Yesterday, he was brought before the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, charged with fraud, and Judge Dai Rongduo presided over the trial. The defendant's testimony was evasive, and the court ordered him to be remanded in custody for a later date, instructing the plaintiff to present evidence for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Stolen Typewriter</h3>
<p>A Russian man, Piroff, residing at the Lani Moore Apartment, 146 Kunshan Road, on the 13th of last month at 8:00 PM, while his neighbor, an Indian man from England named Xu Shi, was asleep, secretly climbed through the window and stole a typewriter worth 2,000 yuan. He entrusted Zhang Xiaomao, the owner of the old goods shop at 175 Zhoujiazui Road, and his partner Qian Ada to find a way to sell the stolen goods. The matter was detected by a Japanese detective from the Hongkou Police Station, who dispatched officers to arrest Piroff and others one by one the other day. Yesterday, they were brought before the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, charged with theft and assisting in the sale of stolen goods. Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the court and interrogated them. The defendant Piroff vehemently denied the theft, while the other two defendants frankly admitted to helping sell the stolen goods. The court concluded the trial, and the defendants were remanded in custody pending judgment.</p>
<h3>Manager of Jingyong Nail Factory Sues Directors for Illegal Actions, Accusing Them of Using Means to Seize Managerial Power. Defendants Deny Illegality, Court Orders Waiting for Judgment</h3>
<p>Zhang Shixin from Wuxi, 35 years old this year, previously established Jingyong Machine Nail Factory Co., Ltd. at 6 Longfu Lane, North Zhejiang Road, gathering twenty shareholders with a capital of 20,000 yuan. Zhang himself was a major shareholder, paying up 4,500 yuan in legal tender, accounting for a quarter of the total capital. Therefore, the board of directors organized by the shareholders elected Zhang as the manager of the factory and Zhu Ruilin, a shareholder with a capital of 1,000 yuan, as the chairman of the board. After Zhang took office as manager, he performed his duties diligently in factory affairs, resulting in</p>
<p>annual profits.</p>
<p>The business aspect was quite developed. However, Zhang and the chairman of the factory's board, Zhu Ruilin, and others disagreed. On April 23rd of this year, Zhang was arrested and detained by Zhu Ruilin and others, and the next day, they convened a meeting and removed Zhang from his position as manager, replacing him with Zhu Ruilin and Long Xisheng as co-managers. After Zhang explained the situation of being wronged to the police station and regained his freedom, he was extremely</p>
<p>angered by</p>
<p>Zhu Ruilin and others for using means to seize managerial power. Recently, he commissioned lawyer Dan Yuhua to file a complaint with the Civil Court of the First Special District Court, requesting a judgment confirming that the resolution of the board meeting convened by Zhu Ruilin and others on April 25th of this year was invalid, and requesting an order for Zhu Ruilin, Long Xisheng, and others to hand over all accounts and for the plaintiff to continue to exercise</p>
<p>managerial authority. His reason was that the defendants Zhu Ruilin and others convened the meeting without a legal quorum (only four out of nine directors were present),</p>
<p>and made decisions arbitrarily.</p>
<p>Moreover, the company's articles of association did not stipulate the term of office for the manager, and the articles of association also stipulated that directors could not send representatives to attend board meetings, claiming that the defendants Zhu Ruilin and others violated as many as eight provisions, requesting a fair judgment according to the law. After the court received the complaint, Judge Mo opened the Second Civil Court the other day to summon them. Both parties commissioned lawyers to appear in court on their behalf. First, the plaintiff Zhang Shixin's representative, lawyer Dan Yuhua, stated</p>
<p>the intention of the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Then, the defendant Zhu Ruilin's representative, lawyer Qian Zheng, detailed that the joint meeting of directors and supervisors convened by the defendant was entirely legal and that there were no illegal acts, requesting the dismissal of the plaintiff's lawsuit. The court questioned both parties in detail for a long time, and after allowing both parties to debate, it announced the conclusion of the case, scheduling the judgment for 3:00 PM on October 11th.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor, We are writing on behalf of our clients, Fei Shuqi and Jin Wenzhi, who have stated that they have recently read in the Xin Shen and Shen Bao newspapers about the owner of the Qiao'anfang houses on Airlike Road disregarding the interests of the residents, which is completely inconsistent with the facts. It has been found that the tenants of the houses have been in arrears for several years. After negotiations between the two parties, the tenants voluntarily moved out, and the houses have been demolished. We are deeply concerned that this will distort the truth and confuse the public. We are writing to you to request that you correct this in order to clarify the facts. This letter is sent on behalf of our clients, hoping that you will grant us space in the "Letters to the Editor" column. Sincerely, Chen Deming, Lawyer, October 6th.</p>

<h3>Football Extravaganza Unfolds: Donghua Wins Both Matches AgainstラックスYesterday, First Team Wins 4-2, Reserve Team Wins 9-0, Li Ning, Liang Shutang, and Others Show Their Former Glory</h3>
<p>The annual football season is scheduled to begin next week (12th). The participating teams are preparing their troops and sharpening their weapons. Yesterday, the Donghua Football Field on Lafayette Road staged two exciting preludes, attracting no less than a thousand spectators. Everything in sight was a group of familiar old friends from the football field, all to see the strength of Donghua Team, the only remaining Chinese powerhouse, after half a season of separation. This Chinese force did not disappoint fans' expectations. In addition to the main team winning 4-2, the reserve team also won a landslide victory of 9-0, and the opponent Lux was completely defeated. The battle situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Donghua First Team Defeats Lux</p>
<p>The match between Donghua's main team and Lux's A team took place after the reserve team's match. For Donghua, He Jiatong, Wu Binghao, Zhang Zhaopeng, and Fei Chunhua continued to play, and their endurance was amazing. Dai Linjing, Zhuang Youren, Wan Jin, Cai Shengsen, and other veterans all played. Li Ning, Liang Shutang, and Han Longhai, who were old friends in the past and are now new players, have added a lot of strength to Donghua. Jia Youliang was unable to play due to illness. The performance of the whole team was very good, no less than last year. Their active front line and tight defense were not easy to achieve at the beginning of the season. Li Ning was as strong as ever, and Liang Shutang was also as strong as before. After the start of the game, in less than three minutes, Lux's left defender, Greenburg, fouled in the penalty area. Cai Shengsen took the penalty kick and scored, opening the scoring first. Five minutes later, Lux's right winger, Kepstin, received a pass from Ryan and scored a goal in the goal area, tying the score at one each. The situation became more and more tense. Shortly after, Adai dribbled into the enemy's camp and scored, ending the first half with Donghua leading 2-1. In the second half, the two teams were evenly matched and there was no progress for ten minutes. Dai Linjing was active in the front, and with one kick, the ball flew into the right corner, giving Donghua a 3-1 lead. After fifteen minutes, Kepke Ding came to the former place, Ryan pulled the shot, Zhuang Youren intercepted, and the ball bounced inward. Bi Gao failed to prevent it, and lost another goal, making the score 3-2. The front line was always dull. Donghua launched many attacks, but unfortunately failed to score until the last five minutes, when Fei Chunhua successfully shot while lying down, and Donghua won 4-2.</p>

<p>Donghua Reserve Team Wins a Big Victory</p>
<p>The two reserve teams of Donghua and Lux played the prelude first. Lux's strength was far inferior to Donghua's. After the start of the game, it was all one-sided. Wu Binghao scored first, followed by Sun Lufang, Liao Shiming, and Lin Dianhua, who scored three goals in a row. The first half ended with Donghua winning 4-0. In the second half, Donghua continued its efforts, while Lux remained the same. Liao Shiming, Lin Dianhua, Sun Lufang, and Shu Shigeng scored five goals in a row, and the final result was 9-0, Donghua won a big victory.</p>

As a result of the game, in the men's category, the British Royal Army defeated the American team 5-5, and in the women's category, the World Team defeated Portugal 7-2. Both sides performed very well. Chinese players Cheng Qilan and Ms. Shen Shuwei were very active and each scored two and three runs, it is said.</p>

<h3>Managing the Household with Thrift, Saving Clothes to Aid</h3>
<p>— Feng Fangfeng</p>
<p>Ms. Feng Wenfeng is a native of Heshan, Guangdong, and the wife of Mr. Deng Zhonghe, owner of Anle Textile Factory. Her father, Mr. Feng Shihan, is proficient in epigraphy and is a famous scholar in Guangdong. When Ms. Feng was five or six years old, her father taught her calligraphy. For more than twenty years, she has diligently studied and practiced, and has become proficient in various ancient and modern styles. Her official script is considered outstanding for the time. It is said that the key to her wonderful brushwork lies in kneeling with a flat palm and firm hand, deeply understanding the secrets of calligraphy. Therefore, her strokes are vigorous, profound, and simple, completely without any feminine air. She is renowned at home and abroad, which is by no means accidental. Currently, for the sake of disaster relief, she has agreed to the newspaper's request to donate all proceeds from her calligraphy of the word "粥" (congee) from tomorrow until February of next year to aid disaster victims. Those who appreciate Ms. Feng's calligraphy are requested to submit their contributions to the Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation Editorial Department of this newspaper for forwarding. -Editor's Note.</p>
<p>Managing the household with thrift is the natural duty of us women, and saving clothing to aid disaster victims is our current responsibility. Now is the season for woolen yarn, so the Shen Bao Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation Special Edition on Woolen Yarn is dedicated to promoting it. Having been asked to contribute an article, I believe that we should pay close attention to at least the following points in order to fulfill our duties.</p>
<p>1.  We should try our best to use high-quality domestic woolen yarn, both to cultivate national strength and enrich people's livelihoods, and to educate our children to have patriotic thoughts.</p>
<p>2.  We should knit ourselves, not rely on others, so as to develop thrifty habits, and not waste useful time on useless or improper entertainment.</p>
<p>3.  We should teach our own daughters or sisters to knit themselves, so that they have life skills and do not have a dependent mindset.</p>
<p>4.  We should study new patterns and strive for progress. For example, we can listen to wireless broadcasts about the latest knitting methods for research assistance.</p>
<p>5.  Disasters occur frequently, and refugees fill the roads. If we think of our fellow citizens in distress, inadequately clothed and shivering pitifully, can we not feel moved? We women are charitable and should each examine our wardrobes. If we have old clothes, such as knitted woolen items, we should donate them to the refugees, fulfill our natural duty of human mutual aid, and set a good example for our children.</p>
<p>6.  If we have no spare clothes, we should do our best to economize and donate money to aid disaster relief. This will not only be in line with the principle of managing the household with thrift, but also help solve the problem of keeping warm for the disaster victims. I hope all sisters will rise up together to promote and implement this!</p>
<h3>A Brief History of Woolen Yarn</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>More than forty years ago, the German firm Quanlong Yangxing was the first to import woolen yarn from its own country, with the Long Brand and Duck Brand. At that time, only women purchased it to tie their hair buns, using it alternately with silk thread. Later, the British firm Lao Gongmao Yangxing also entered this business. Seeing great potential in the future, they set up a factory in Shanghai to manufacture it. Their most famous product was the Beehive Brand (commonly known as Honeycomb Brand) woolen yarn, which was sold throughout the country for a long time without any competition. It was not until 1928 that Chinese people began to set up factories to produce it themselves. Since then, many others have followed, and to date, domestic woolen yarn has achieved amazing success. The quality is no less than that of imported goods, so Chinese people have changed their past habit of exclusively buying foreign goods and have begun to purchase domestic goods. Nowadays, the use of woolen yarn has expanded to a very wide range due to the ever-changing knitting techniques and the economic efficiency of its use. In the future, the prospects of domestic woolen yarn, like the destiny of China, are bright and promising.</p>
<h3>A Collection Spot for Yarn: A Sketch of Xingsheng Street</h3>
<p>— Bei Lei</p>
<p>The weather is gradually turning cold, and most people are wearing clothes knitted from yarn. The staff in the many yarn shops on Xingsheng Street are no longer as idle as they were in the summer, but are busy dealing with customers. In the old-fashioned display cases and the new-style display windows, the colorful yarn dazzles passersby, creating a strong temptation for those who wish to add yarn garments to their wardrobe. Take another look at the "model" wearing a knitted yarn coat; its attitude seems quite proud, as if smiling and saying to you, "Why not make yourself warmer and more fashionable?"</p>
<p>Over 90 percent of those who come to buy yarn are women, who arrive in groups of two or three, though there are also quite a few young women who come alone. They look at this, flip through that, chat with each other for a while, and then choose what they love and take it home. Some are buying for their parents, hoping to keep the elderly warmer. Some are knitting something for their husbands, which seems much more intimate than buying something machine-knitted from the market. Some are preparing a gift for their sweetheart, which is truly the perfect gift, and will make the recipient's heart feel happy. Others are buying for themselves, as a beautiful yarn autumn outfit in a fashionable color and style is indispensable for modern women.</p>
<p>Xingsheng Street is located in the eastern district of the French Concession, stretching from Min’guo Road in the south to Gongguan Ma Road in the north. In terms of transportation, all trams heading east from the French Concession pass through here. The No. 2 and No. 9 buses of the Public Concession, as well as the No. 16 and No. 19 trolleybuses, are also very close, just a short walk from the Jiangxi Road terminus. In this short street, yarn shops occupy half of it, numbering over thirty. Some of the shops have very modern storefront designs, having shed their old appearance and giving people a fresh impression. The larger ones all have knitting service departments, employing specialists who teach customers new knitting methods or knit for them, providing convenience and assistance. The service providers are all young women who are enthusiastic and diligent. The knitting experts Ms. Huang Peiying, Ms. Bao Guofang, and Ms. Feng Qiuping have each published specialized books on knitting methods, which those interested in studying can inquire about at the yarn shops. You are sure to find much inspiration for your knitting.</p>
<p>The quality of domestically produced wool yarn has made remarkable progress in recent years, but some customers, due to a lack of understanding, still prefer to buy imported goods at high prices. The shop assistants are very enthusiastic and always try their best to persuade them to buy domestic products. Don't underestimate the shop assistants; the dawn of domestic goods is entrusted to them!</p>
<p>Although several yarn shops have established branches on Avenue Joffre and Jing'an Temple Road for the convenience of customers, Xingsheng Street remains a concentration of yarn shops. Every day, countless women leave their footprints on Xingsheng Street; they are the most common patrons of Xingsheng Street.</p>
<h3>The Once Popular Double Cat Brand Yarn</h3>
<p>Among the various yarns on the market, the Double Cat brand is truly an outstanding product, manufactured by the Shanghai Wool Yarn Textile Factory. The factory is large in scale and handles all processes from spinning to dyeing, ensuring bright colors that never fade. It is available in various thicknesses and weights. Since its release, it has been unanimously praised from all quarters. Not only is it sold throughout China, but it is also popular in places such as New York, Boston, Chicago in the United States, British South Africa, the American Philippines, Myanmar, India, Bangkok, and Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Little Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Ms. Shen Jingzhang</p>
<p>Attention Readers of Next Week’s Special Issue on Yarn Knitting</p>
<p>Washing Method for Yarn Clothes: Use lukewarm water (never boiling water) with a small amount of soap powder. After it dissolves, put the yarn clothes into the water and wash gently with your hands, turning them every five minutes. After cleaning, rinse with clean water. Do not wring vigorously; it is better to shake them dry.</p>
<p>Storage Method for Yarn Clothes: When yarn clothes are not needed, expose them to the sun for half an hour, then place four small packets of camphor powder around the four sides of the yarn clothes. Wrap them well with clean white paper and store them in a box.</p>
<p>Ironing Method for Yarn Clothes: First, turn the yarn clothes inside out, then cover them with a piece of white cloth. Then, spray water and iron them flat with an iron.</p>
<p>Yarn Joining Method: Separate the ends of four-strand fine or coarse yarn, and then splice them together. This will make the knot flat and prevent it from unraveling.</p>
<p>Simple Buttonhole Opening Method: Insert your left finger into the place where you want to open a buttonhole on the yarn garment. Use a sewing needle and a thread of the same color, and sew one stitch in each row at the buttonhole. This method is simple and even.</p>

<h3>One Week Economic Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I received a letter forwarded by the editor from Ms. Xi Suheng, in which she praised my economic menu for its contribution to general housewives. I am ashamed to accept such praise. According to Ms. Xi, she knows nothing about cooking, so she is seeking help from me, asking me to designate a location for me to personally teach her, or to introduce her to a school that specializes in Chinese cuisine. Ms. Xi's sincere words in her letter deeply resonated with me, but I am very ashamed to admit that my cooking skills are too ordinary and I am not qualified to be a professor, and I also do not have the time or a suitable location. Speaking of schools that specialize in Chinese cuisine, there are currently none, and I sincerely hope that someone will come forward to open one. As for the art of cooking, it is nothing more than seven methods: pan-frying, stir-frying, braising, stewing, deep-frying, steaming, and mixing. The seasoning must be moderate, not too bland, too salty, too sweet, or too greasy. Compared to the diverse subjects in school, it is ultimately much simpler. I advise Ms. Xi to temporarily inquire among relatives and friends for those who are skilled in cooking and frequently ask them for advice, or to pay attention and observe when her nanny or neighbors are cooking, and within one or two months, she will definitely be able to do it herself. Enough with the small talk, let's look at this week's menu:</p>
<p>Monday</p>
<p>Stir-fried Green Beans with Shredded Pork, Sweet and Sour Fried Beltfish, Shepherd's Purse Tofu Soup, Scallion Shredded Radish</p>
<p>Tuesday</p>
<p>Stir-fried Celery with Shredded Beef, Steamed Croaker, Braised Winter Melon Slices, Stir-fried Cabbage with Rice Noodles</p>
<p>Wednesday</p>
<p>Stir-fried Shepherd's Purse with Liver Oil, Braised Pomfret Slices, Baiye with Bok Choy, Dried Bean Curd with Chrysanthemum Greens</p>
<p>Thursday</p>
<p>Curry Beef Slices, Stir-fried Baiye with Small Shrimp, Braised Cabbage, Scallion Broad Bean Paste</p>
<p>Friday</p>

<h3>Shanghai Bank Allocates Funds to Aid University Students</h3>
<p>— Wei Sai</p>
<p>Poor students need relief; this is a fact that no one can deny. Recently, there have been several places in Shanghai working to help underprivileged students, but I always feel that their strength is ultimately not great, inevitably a drop in the bucket. Therefore, solving the problem requires the efforts of all parties, especially influential sectors.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank's Social Welfare Subsidy Committee has allocated 100,000 yuan annually since the 29th year to be used as scholarships for outstanding underprivileged students in specialized schools above the vocational level. This great measure is truly worthy of our admiration. What we admire is not just these 100,000 yuan; it is because: perhaps due to its "starting shot," other banks, companies, firms, and major factories, businesses, and organizations will follow suit, forming a trend of considering scholarships as a noble honor.</p>
<p>It subsidizes 400 students each year, each receiving 400 yuan annually. All outstanding underprivileged university students who have been studying at various universities or vocational colleges for more than one year can apply for this scholarship. The application procedure is: students who believe they meet the criteria for being underprivileged and outstanding can apply directly to the school authorities, who will then select the students who are suitable for this scholarship from among the applicants and recommend them to the bank. The number of students that the school should recommend will be notified to the school in advance by the bank. Therefore, the number of students recommended by the school must not exceed the specified number.</p>
<p>If it is a very large university and the number of places is very small, then, according to the bank's regulations, students should be selected from the agricultural, medical, engineering, commercial, and science departments.</p>
<p>What are the criteria for being underprivileged and outstanding? Its regulations also clearly tell us. The criteria for being underprivileged are: (1) The family has no real property income, (2) Parents, elder brothers, uncles, and paternal uncles are unable to help with school and living expenses, (3) Relatives and friends are unable to provide loans. The criteria for being outstanding are: (1) Good health, (2) Good conduct, (3) Relatively excellent grades in all subjects, (4) Rich in patriotic thought, (5) Rich in the spirit of service.</p>
<h3>The Yin (Lunar) Calendar and the Nong (Agricultural) Calendar</h3>
<p>— Ti Lu</p>
<p>Nowadays, the term "nong li" (agricultural calendar) is often used to refer to the yin li (lunar calendar) on invitation cards and calendars. The originator probably thought that the yin calendar was convenient for agriculture, hence this term. The yin calendar has been used in China for a long time, and farmers are accustomed to it, so it is not easy to change it suddenly. This is a fact, but to say that this calendar is convenient for agriculture is the opposite of the truth.</p>
<p>The yin calendar takes one lunar cycle as a month. The moon is called taiyin (great yin), hence it is called the yin calendar. The yang calendar takes one revolution of the earth around the sun as a year. The sun is called taiyang (great yang), hence it is called the yang calendar. The so-called twenty-four solar terms are originally intended to indicate the cold and heat of the seasons. They also take one revolution of the earth around the sun as the beginning and end, which is in line with the yang calendar. Therefore, each solar term has a fixed month and day in the yang calendar, and even if there is a difference, it is only one day. It is not like the yin calendar, where the dates differ so much that they can be almost a month apart. Now, I will list the yang calendar months and days of the twenty-four solar terms below:</p>
<p>Minor Cold January 5th or 6th</p>
<p>Major Cold January 20th or 21st</p>
<p>Start of Spring February 4th or 5th</p>
<p>Rain Water February 19th or 20th</p>
<p>Awakening of Insects March 6th or 7th</p>
<p>Vernal Equinox March 21st or 22nd</p>
<p>Pure Brightness April 5th or 6th</p>
<p>Grain Rain April 20th or 21st</p>
<p>Start of Summer May 6th or 7th</p>
<p>Grain Full May 21st or 22nd</p>
<p>Grain in Ear June 6th or 7th</p>
<p>Summer Solstice June 22nd</p>
<p>Minor Heat July 7th or 8th</p>
<p>Major Heat July 23rd or 24th</p>
<p>Start of Autumn August 8th or 9th</p>
<p>Limit of Heat August 23rd or 24th</p>
<p>White Dew September 8th or 9th</p>
<p>Autumnal Equinox September 23rd or 24th</p>
<p>Cold Dew October 8th or 9th</p>
<p>Frost's Descent October 24th</p>
<p>Start of Winter November 7th or 8th</p>
<p>Minor Snow November 22nd or 23rd</p>
<p>Major Snow December 7th or 8th</p>
<p>Winter Solstice December 22nd or 23rd</p>
<p>The earth's revolution around the sun takes 365.2422 days. The beginning and end of the twenty-four solar terms, of course, also take 365.2422 days. However, a year in the yang calendar cannot have a fraction of a day, only 365 days. The remaining 0.2422 days accumulate to almost one day every four years, so the solar terms have a difference of one day. When it is necessary to have a leap year, one leap day is added at the end of February, that is, an additional 29th day is added, which roughly eliminates the accumulated sum of the remaining 0.2422 days each year, and the solar terms return to their original days. As for the yin calendar, its principle is to take the period from Start of Spring to Start of Spring as a year, which is also one revolution of the earth around the sun. However, its calculation of months is based on the lunar cycle, with each month being 30 days for a large month and 29 days for a small month. Therefore, a year of twelve months is only about 354 days, which is at least ten days less than the 365.2422 days of the earth's revolution around the sun. Statistically, a leap month must be added every three years to correct the cold and heat. Therefore, the solar terms in the yin calendar do not have fixed months and days. Taking the Start of Spring as an example, it can be as late as the fifteenth day of the first month or as early as the sixteenth day of the twelfth month of the previous year. Compared to the yang calendar, where the months and days differ by no more than one day, the difference in the months and days of the yin calendar can be said to be great.</p>
<p>Farmers rely on the solar terms for farming, following the seasonal weather. If the yang calendar is used, one can know the arrival of a certain solar term from the month and day, rather than just remembering the unreliable months and days of the yin calendar and having to consult the almanac. Unfortunately, Chinese farmers still do not know the close relationship between the yang calendar and the solar terms, so they are still unwilling to abandon the yin calendar. As for the benefits of convenience for agriculture, only the yang calendar has them. Therefore, the term "nong li" (agricultural calendar) should be applied to the yang calendar; using it to refer to the yin calendar obscures the truth.</p>
<p>Hawthorne's Investigation</p>
<h3>The Whereabouts of the Dancing Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Eight: Two People Arrested</p>
<p>Yu Gantang nodded and replied, "Okay. Li Lan has always loved me, and I love her! ——"</p>
<p>At this moment, I suddenly felt a sentence that I couldn't hold back, rising from the bottom of my heart, breaking through my throat and spitting it out. "Love you? Love her? What kind of love is this? What you study in college is probably a specialty in love. Is this the new philosophy of love you created!"</p>
<p>Yu Gantang only glanced at me, did not have the courage to look at me, and then lowered his head in silence.</p>
<p>Hawthorne smiled and said, "This is originally not considered love. But now, in order to clarify the case, we have to let the word 'love' be insulted for a while. Brother Gantang, continue."</p>
<p>When Yu Gantang continued to speak, his voice was much weaker, and he was also trying his best to avoid the word "love." He said, "We were originally very good with each other, but because of this Zhao Boxiong, she became indifferent to me. Whenever I asked her to go out, she always used false excuses to decline. Because once I asked her to go to the movies, she said she had a headache and wouldn't go, but later I saw her with Zhao Boxiong at the movie theater. Later, I ran into this Zhao at her house, and we had an argument. I once followed this guy's tracks and learned that he lived at 774 Yadong. On the seventeenth day, a friend told me that he saw Li Lan go to 774 Yadong on the night before. After I went to the hotel to investigate on the seventeenth night, it was indeed true. Yesterday morning, I called Li Lan to ask, and she honestly admitted it. I did say a few threatening words to her. Everything that the police officer from the police station, that Mr. Ni, said about my actions is indeed true, and I don't need to deny it. However, as for Li Lan, I just wanted to scare her a little, to make her break off with that Zhao. I absolutely did not mean to beat her to death — this is absolutely not true, because I know that although she is so romantic, her heart is still — still — belongs to me."</p>
<p>Hawthorne had a smile on the corner of his lips, as if he was laughing at him for avoiding the word "love," and he was indeed using twelve points of strength. He still asked lightly, "Since you didn't mean to beat her to death, why did you borrow a gun from your friend Song Zhaoji?"</p>
<p>Yu Gantang hurriedly replied, "This wasn't to beat Li Lan. To be honest, I wanted to settle the score with that Zhao. I went to his house to inquire, also because of him. I feel that my strength and his strength cannot coexist!" (129)</p>
