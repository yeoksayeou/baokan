<p>社評</p>
<h3>英國在歧途上</h3>
<p>曾有人說；「東方的一切永遠不會爲西方人士所瞭解」，這自然是一種過甚之辭；但如果以此解釋今日英國的對日外交，到似乎是一語破的。歷數當代國際間勞而無功的事，殆無過於英國的對日外交；有如克萊琪之流，栗六終年，何曾有些許的收穫？他們所念茲在茲的改善英日關係，大有類於童話中的青鳥，每次都是在剛要到手的剎那間轉化爲相反的物事。這並非英國外交技巧的拙劣，主要的癥結則由於央國至今還存在英日同盟時代舊觀念的遺毒，因而不能對於此際的遠東情勢具有正確的理解。</p>
<p>最近英當局已一再拒絕德國的「和平」建議，表示再不存有妥協的幻想，但這却是以絕大代價換取的結論，在兩年以前——甚至一年以前，英國的態度並小如此堅決。而在遠東，則縱然也同樣付出了許多代價，却依舊讓謬妄的幻想統馭着其外交政策的全部。在英國執政者的抱負，大槪以爲；第一，英國際此生死關頭，再不能增加正面的敵人；第二，只有讓步，纔能換取日本善意的中立；第三，讓步政策可以扶助日本溫和份子抬頭，防範日本極端份子的蠻幹。這幾點，無一不是沿襲着舊時代的傳統觀念；沿襲傳統，遂主忽略了一些新的因素—例如中國的抗戰—並未被放在攷慮之列。因此一方就對日本估量過高，聽到日方加入德義方面作戰的官傳就發生莫名的恐怖；另一方面，又對日估量過低、幻想英國的讓步竟有左右日本國策的力量。事實上日本的反英運動實肇始於歐戰未起之前，英國對日的退讓、也並非從對德作戰期間纔實行。所以英日間的問題在目前縱與歐洲方面的戰事互相牽聯，實則截然二事，並不一定像唐寗街的人物所想像那樣密切。而日本對外的基本政策，實決定於日本統治者本身的慾求實力與各方國際關係的總和，斷非僅爲英方態度强　所影響，從英日海關協定到最近滇緬路的封鎖，英方每一次的讓步無非招致更多的侮辱與更大的要挾。此次關於緬旬路的讓步，還不到十天，，旅日英僑即大批遭受逮捕，且促成考克斯氏的慘死，這即使不輕薄地視同英方的自食其報，至低限度亦當使英方朝野人士重大反省。</p>
<p>在幾個有關遠東的列强當中，以英國對日本爲最講禮讓，比較最不客氣的則爲美國與蘇聯。而有如張鼓峯和諾蒙亨的戰役，商約的廢止和禁運，都並未激起日本激烈的報復；在最近的近衛政策當中據說美蘇都是日本所準備調整國交的重要對象。英國對日讓步最多，幫助也最大，却只是接連受到打擊，所謂增進友誼迄今仍屬可望而不可即。固然，目前英國正在作戰，牽製孔多，不像美蘇那樣進退自如；但距今一月以前，正是英國處境危殆萬狀的時候，日本也並未能有所作為，目前英國地位已顯見進步，外交運用亦頗見進展，又何為一味對着暗影懷具無謂恐怖？</p>
<p>現在倫敦方面似乎已經認識此次拘捕英僑事態之嚴重、民間也發出了報復的呼聲，但多年的錯誤成見，究竟能吾以一時的刺激而根本肅淸，則仍爲疑問。須知此次逮捕英僑事件是執行着日政府的侖令，亦即是日本政府的行動，甚至竟不妨斷定其即屬近衛準備在今天發表的內閣政策之一部。這並不像以往日本反英運動之可以諉過於出征的侵華軍人，而且在日本所謂「新體制」的政權之下將不再可能存在有溫和派與激烈派的對立。英國對遠東的傳統見解已完全成爲陳腐，如果不適應着新的現實而有所澈底轉變，則遲早英國必不免有被迫退出遠東的一天；不見日前所傳的日本新閣基本政策大綱中，已把緬旬印度都包括在貫澈日本理想以建設大東亞的範圍之內麼？</p>
<p>前此英國之封鎖緬路貨運，曾藉口於美國不肯予英以援助的保證，這一解釋不妨姑予以無保留的接受；則目前美國態度旣已堅定明確不容懷疑，新的壓迫又重新加到英國身上，此後英國究將繼續綏靖政策以自貽伊戚，抑或懸崖勒馬而幡然改圖，全要看英當局對於此次事變如何認識，如何去抉擇運用。</p>
<h3>各代表簽約後　泛美會宣告閉幕　赫爾國務卿發表文告　大會成就為經濟自足</h3>
<p>哈伐那　泛美大會自經各國代表簽就最後條約、卽於昨日下午八時十分宣告閉幕、美國務卿赫爾於昨晚離哈伐那前、曾發表文告、將大會成縱作一統計、渠稱、此項成就、爲一經濟自足之機構、基於誠實公平及友好之原則、以互相往來云、同時、赫爾並稱、美洲各國「有絕對能力保衛渠等之信條」、古巴國務卿肯姆巴於致別辭中稱、此次大會對美洲目標具有重大貢獻、乃屬毫無疑義之事云、（三十一日合衆社電）</p>
<p>哈伐那　美國務卿赫爾今日離此前、盛讚美洲各國決議團結、以保各國之完整、赫爾告新聞訪員謂、美洲各國政府、已向世界表示、彼等堅抱保持並增强大陸團結一致之精神與制度之決心不可動搖、赫爾又誠摯切實聲明、美洲無一國會抱些微之思擬乘歐戰之時機、攫取土地、各共和國所</p>
<p>紐約　美國多數無綫電台批評員、對於泛美大會之結果、皆判爲美國政治上毫無疑問的勝利、若干批評員謂、美國乃具其武力可實施條文之唯一國家、此卽美國得在西半球防務中獲取自由手腕之理由云、惟威廉士在其廣播中謂、大會尚未對於歐人領土所有權轉移之問題、獲取其所希望者、如在赤道南拉丁美利堅國內、美國空軍根據地之辦法、未獲妥洽、則美人尚未可視大局爲成功云、（三十一日路透社電）</p>

<h3>日理萬機之　羅斯福生活片段</h3>
<p>七年以來，美國總統羅斯福負擔着世界上最重大約職務，他却能隨處流露勝任愉快，胃口健旺，熟睡得像小孩子一般。他最顯著的特點，就是對於生活具有極大的興味，因之對於繁重的職務，還能「樂此不疲」，要是換上別人，恐怕早就「退避三舍」了。近來內憂外患，相逼而至，羅斯福總統夙夜從公，更少安息的機會。他在白宮之中，歷有年所，經過許多急迫困難之事，全力以赴，絲毫不懈。哇海華發生水災之時，他書室之中，深夜兩時，燈火猶明；桌上攤滿了地圖報告，四圍是秘書和軍部人員，他從長途電話中向西部的州長指示機宜。歐洲發生戰爭後，正副國務卿赫爾和威爾斯，常在他臥室之中，天明猶未別去。羅斯福具有救火員的精神，一聞警報，立刻動作。祇有去年九月中，歐戰剛剛爆發之頃，道位向來笑顏逐開，生龍活虎的大總統，忽然政躬失和，肝火大旺。一等到國會通過他的中立法之後，他便跑上溫泉去休息，恢復疲乏的神經。現在羅斯福已獲得了非常的自信力，爲稱譽者所快，懷疑者所懼了。</p>
<p>羅斯福總統的一天工作開始於八時半至九時之間，先在床舖上安閒的進早膳。秘書，親信的顧問，和有時候一位閣員，已環侍在側。膳畢整裝，坐了裝輪椅子，由人把他推到辦公室的寫字桌前。會見閣員和客人等的時間，由十時或十時半，直至下午五時或五時半。中間進一頓便餐，就在餐桌上和大員們會商要公。有時候他便請最後所會見的一位客人和他一同游泳，那游泳池是他進白宮後所建造的。通常在游泳之後，繼以按摩。如果晚上復有別的事，他便在書室中會商國是。吾則就隨意讀書，或鑒賞集郵。如有正式宴會，他在接待最後所到的一位客人之後，便獨自退到自己的私室裏，由他的夫人周旋於衆賓之間</p>
<p>他的私人醫師麥克殷泰，對於總統的身體非常注意，不過羅斯福很能自己節制。他胃口很好，然而體重常在一百八十二磅至一百八十七磅之間，上落不過五磅左右而巳。他歡喜吃野味和魚，尤其嗜食甲魚，可惜不容易消化。有時候進餐之前略飲「考克推爾」。非正式的飯局常在書室中舉行。他常向客人道：「你們用些什麼酒」？如果那時候已有了「考克推爾」，那末飯後不再飲酒了。麥克殷泰醫師主張總統於過了相富期間之後，便應出外一遊，變換環境。羅期福於旅行休息期中，除了以半小時的時間，聽取白宮方面公務報告之外，常能完全擺脫一切，領略燕居之樂。他對於海軍，本來是新輪老手，常藉出遊之便，從事演習中的指揮。一旦倦遊歸來，少不得第一步是接見新聞記者，晒得黑油油的笑臉，啣着一枝香烟，精神飽滿，姿勢優美。很明顯的，他對於這把總統交椅，眞可謂其樂融融。他手握大權，刺激神秘，他具有童心的天眞善悅。</p>
<p>他有伶人叫塲的本領，他從不像普通人的走上講台，正像紅伶上塲一般，扣準觀衆們情緒最高漲的時候，倐自從天而降。他演講的時候，該緊張的時候緊張，該停頓的時候停頓，他恰好把聽衆們報以彩聲的時候，牢牢握住。他所採用的意旨，詞句，噱頭，甚至早先預備好的演講，都經過他四週頭挑的謀士悉心推敲，所以任何一個最後文告，除了他自已參酌之外，早就經過四五個人的簽注了。他雖在　目時艱的今日，譏諷，詼諧的風趣，並未稍减。他又不善墨守成規，往往穿了便裝，接見外賓，放棄陳腐濫調，代之以爽利的妙論。</p>
<p>羅斯福老太太，和他的夫人伊麗諾，敎子相夫，高人一等，都是不可多得者。羅夫人的聲望地位幾可與他的丈夫分庭抗禮。要是這位總統夫人比較的不活動些，羅斯福在白宮中的生活也許可以安靜些，不過在人情，同情和寬大之道上，似乎也要感到欠缺哩。他的侍從員有時候對於「從後門來」的「抖亂」客人提起抗議，謝謝羅斯福夫人，這便是她的德政。羅夫人的親友常常帶些「在野」的消息給總統開開「耳界」。以夫婦的情分而論，他倆眞是今之孟梁。自然在白宮之中，他們兩人都是忙得不得開交的，所以慣常上總是羅夫人在晚上書室裏，或總統公事方畢，和他的丈夫做過閒適的家常談話。論起家事，他對於最近長公子傑美的離婚事件，表示非常遺憾。</p>
<p>在白宮中和他共事的小小組織中，有一位做過他二十年的秘書瑪谷蘭·萊亨女士，當然要名列前茅。俊美的個子，服裝整飭，幽靜貞淑，做起事來，眞所謂「有個樣子」。總統的一切私人函牘，個人事務，都是雙手奉託她辦理。這位「大小姐」在白宮中有私人的起居室，臥房，和浴間。電話司機生對於駐法大法蒲列德或駐英大使坎納第夜間從大西洋彼岸發來的畏途電話，首先要經過「大小姐」的手，如果她說「行」，總統床頭的電話機便鈴聲大震了。羅斯福總統對待朋友，極盡厚道，他除了家庭，朋友，和同事之外，衆流廣交，一落大派，都是美國人精神。上自貴胄，下至販夫，如果普接會晤，他總有方法，對付得很好。</p>
<p>忍耐和使人迷悅的力量，都是羅斯福對待人的武器。往往有人悻悻而來，結果却是惘惘而去。還有些人見了他之後，更不免說：「他豈非很動人麼？」好像發現了一種珍奇似的哩。在這一九四〇年多事之秋，那位坐在白宮裏的「人」倒是處之泰然。經濟上的顧慮，許多前任總統所視爲畏途的他却夷然視之，他有生以夾，就靠着些私人收入，過的日子也頗舒適，在白宮中自奉待客，兩不苛刻。有些專門注意這一類事的人說，他常年的旅行和宴樂費祗不過二萬五千元，決不能支付這項的開銷。請請皇族貴賓，一動就要許多的錢。甚至把他的私人收入和薪金等併進去，也還不敷，好在他大來大往，用些老本，亦不見愁。他很有自知之明，萬一退職做一品大百姓，單論憑他的編輯才具或寫寫文章，也並不是沒有辦法的。何况他夫人賺錢的本領，已經另創一格呢。</p>
<p>接近羅斯福總統的人，說他做人有兩種理論。一種是樂觀而不怕事的，凡是有利於人類的，他無不竭力去做成功。一件事情到手，他總得弄些辦法去求解決。因爲秉性率直，而又有些性急，遇到任何事件，立刻就希望獲得補救之方。匡時濟世，呼籲和平，聲嘶力竭，全力以赴之。。只求心之所安，他非所問了。他對於一已的判斷力，誠信之至。另外一個理論却比較的複雜了。在他心坎深處，創痕重重，未始不是一個傷心之人。話雖如此，他鼓起勇氣，歡樂爲懷，體上天好生之德，廣行一切「善事」。羅期福總統位極人品，謙遜懷虛，崇高偉大，就是得力於這一點哩。拿所謂任何一個理論，來解釋這樣一位出類拔萃的人，是過於簡單而不够的。究竟他的一切措施，對於國家爲功爲罪，留待他日靑史，自有定論。</p>

<h3>颶風突然疾進　昨晚掠滬市　潮汐被風掀動　馬路已見湧水</h3>
<p>此次颶風進展甚速、江海關昨日上午十時、接天文台報告、颶風已進至北緯二十七·三十度、東經一百二十五度、風力中心爲六十海里內、向北西疾進、有襲滬可能、海關遂於昨日上午十時五十分、在鐘樓屋頂旗桿上、懸掛黑球一枚、預測颶風將到滬、警告浦江船隻預防、至下午四時二十五分、海關又接天文台報告、颶風近滬、已在北緯二十八·三十度、東經一百二十四度、風力中心仍爲六十海里、依然北西向疾進、已抵吳淞口外銅沙海面、海關卽加懸黑球一枚、故於昨日下午四時牛後、海關鐘樓旗桿上、已有黑球二枚高懸、入晚改懸紅燈兩盞、</p>
<p>信號標識</p>
<p>聞今晨如風勢不退、信號卽照本月二十四日、海關港務長特貝克第七號布告、於今日（八月一日）起改懸黑十字一個、至嗣後信號仍懸黑球一枚、夜間仍點紅燈一盞、緊急時紅燈兩盞、自昨日海關懸掛黑球二枚後、浦江情勢頓形緊張、進口各輪均開足速度、俾得提早靠埠、出口船隻中止起椗、</p>
<p>各輪避風</p>
<p>昨有太古公司慶元輪赴香港·海防、於上午十時出口後、因得颶風報告、在吳淞口拋錨避風、重慶輪昨晨十一時出口赴秦皇島、亦在吳淞口拋泊、海口輪原定昨午起椗赴香港、因避風遂中止離滬、怡和洋行貴生輪、定昨日赴香港海防、永生輪亦定昨日赴天津、均中止啟　、一俟颶風過後、卽行出口、另有希臘輪Hellenie　Trader號、前日自西貢裝儎大量洋米、計二萬四千七百餘包來滬、原定昨日卸竣後赴靑島，亦因颶風中止離滬、</p>
<p>今晨過滬</p>
<p>至於怡和洋行裕生輪、此次自海防經香港來滬、聞本市郵務局長乍配林氏、亦乘該輪返滬、原定今日到埠、但突然發生颶風、該輪到滬恐將延期、據大通社記者向天文台探悉、颶風中心、大致於今晨過滬、如不登陸、則將向黃海趨進、昨日浦江雖値小汎、惟潮汎已被風雨所掀起、馬路均見積水、</p>

<h3>自來火工潮　仍相持中　勞方靜待工部局調解</h3>

<h3>日方在法租界檢郵　業已成為事實　日檢查員七人開始工作</h3>
<p>日方檢查馬斯南路郵政支局郵件、在迫不及待情勢下，已於前日進駐郵局、昨晨八時、日檢查員三人、繼續到局辦公、茲錄各情如次、</p>
<p>總局命令</p>
<p>據大通社記者探悉、上海郵政管理局、業已密令馬斯南路郵局、對檢查該局郵件、悉依照二十七年檢查管理局郵件辦法辦理、馬斯南路支局方面、並已預備檢查簿一種、當日檢查員將信件檢扣後、卽向是項簿册中簽字、如此則局方可不負責任、</p>
<p>開始翻閱</p>
<p>日方檢查員七人自於前晨八時金數齊集郵局後、業已完成進駐形式、昨晨八時、七檢查員中之三人、繼續進駐於信差間、翻閱信件、若輩檢查員之胸前、均佩有圓形金屬徽章一枚、均能操中日英三國語言、據其中一人向馬斯南路郵局員表示、渠等向在東北各郵局担任檢郵工作、</p>
<p>撤銷投遞</p>
<p>又據大通社記者向上海郵政管理局幫辦王偉生君詢悉、局方雖在研究將馬斯南路郵局收寄郵件、均歸管理局投遞、如此則投送於該局轄境內之郵件、須遲延半日、此點能吾得寄件人或收件人之諒解、殊有考慮必要、</p>
<p>單獨行動</p>
<p>王氏最後對馬斯南路郵局郵件之檢查員、尚未開始檢查一點　謂渠可負責保證、此事之實行、已屬箭在弦上、惟王氏嗣對該局郵件開始檢查時、由管理局通知馬斯南路郵局一點、則表示不然、緣郵件之檢查出於日方之單獨行動、不屬郵政範圍以內也、</p>
<p>辦公房屋</p>
<p>馬斯南路郵局預備安頓檢查員地點、在該局封包袋之後面、擬圍築房閒兩間、業由匠作予以丈量，惟尚未開始架欄、在該室未圍築竣工前、日檢查員顯以信差間爲臨時辦公之所、觀於前昨兩日情形、各種信件、已開始被其染指、僅尚無檢扣之事實、又悉上海郵務長乍配林、搭裕生輪由港來滬、已可於明日到埠、</p>
<p>局長未辭</p>
<p>又據郵政管理局副郵務長王偉生氏談、報載郵務長乍配林氏、將有辭職之訊、此說係傳聞之誤、乍氏現主持一海管理局郵政、最近及將來決不致於辭職、</p>

<p>勸募急賑</p>
<p>鎭海紅卍字會會長陳紹先、現適因公在滬、鑒於鎭邑罹米荒後、又遭兵災、情關桑梓、爰特組織急賑委員會、先籌賑款一萬元、已於二十七日由該會電匯甬乙豐紗號辦事處轉送鎭海紅卍字會、由代理紅卍字會救濟事務之金甘光負責分發賑濟、一面並積極在滬勸募賑款、慨捐者頗爲踴躍、迄昨日止、已達數千元之鉅、該會收款處巨籟達路同福里四號、世界紅卍字會總辦事處、又寗波路景行里二十一號乙豐紗布號、南京路中華勸工銀行、及天津路惠中銀行、</p>

<p>昨日現洋米、晨初尚稱平穩、惟後突起暴烈之漲風、驟增三元之巨、蓋早市開手、原根客販已堅持扳守、作客悉在觀機、市面平淡、詎意遷延許久、內地客戶極力搜求、本鄉店胃繼之暢辦、一時買氣旺盛、形成進多出少之勢、有貨者居奇、漲風乃不可遏、收盤一號陳西貢巳至五十六元、五十五元半、新尖五十四元半、洋米昨晨以實銷趁低問津、市塲浮貨早經出淸、大戶行囤不肯再以低價售出、而內地杭州各幫新有派司一萬多已領出、卽在市收買現米六千包、連同前存付裝、散戶跟蹤問津、市乃立轉上升、現米漲起二元至三元不一、而上月二十六號裝二號暹邏已到各批、目下均已併入大戶手中、未補浮空與客囤不得不放價問津、故開價五十七元後、節節　加高至六十元、比之前日五十六元半乃較大三元半、小絞西貢亦均抬高三四元、致未成交、而回籠暹米開出四百多噸、現米則逾萬包云、</p>

<p>小麥　昨日交易依然不多，而市面亦疲憊如常、蓋蘇錫一帶、供源不絕、日廠華廠均乏暢胃、貨方雖有擯持之意卒難挽其頹勢、聞日廠進價祇合十八元左右、與華廠相差仍須二元、成交約有二三千包、</p>

<h3>金市背外匯下跌</h3>
<p>昨日本市現金烚赤暗市、漲後驟告狂跌、終背外匯反見軋小六十五元、實因小錢莊代散多等傾向售出、缺少買戶維持也、久趨堅定之各方人心已轉疲、晨開卽承上日漲勢、外匯報緊、開市卽高達五千五百十元、銀號買風中、昂見五千五百卅十五元高價、未半小時、外匯忽打破三日來祗緊不回之軟勢、轉見回硬、錢兌業等猛烈拋售、進者觀望、價逐步在落至五千四百十元、午刻雖稍抬上、終復下挫、收市五千四百十五元、計反動回小六十五元、半日交易約二千兩、下午週三無市、飾金旋漲卽回平、關金等均平、</p>

<h3>金融述評　續完</h3>
<p>— 埾凱</p>
<p>七月二十七日止</p>
<p>由上面的分析，可見日本對日元集團輸出的躍進，造成日本貿易上的底運，確是日本戰時經濟的一種大危機，日本當局亦深了解這種情况的不利，故對日元集團的輸出，迭加限制。一九三八年七月對於滿洲華北華中等日軍佔領區域的輸出加以限制，如棉紗·棉布等，其後逐漸擴充至羊毛製品。樹膠製品·氈帽·肥皂等，但日元集團內的物價騰貴，向日元集團的輸出依然旺盛，乃在一九三九年九月二十日日本工商部又公佈關於對滿洲關東華北華中的輸出調整法，規定對非日元集團國內的輸出品和擴充國內生產能力的物品以及國民生活必需品等，非經核准，不能向日元集團輸出。像這樣一再限禁對元集團的貿易，但是結果它的趨勢仍在向上發展，看了今年的貿易統計，可以說日本的輸出貿易幾乎是日元集團貿易，而輸入貿易全是第三國家貿易。</p>
<p>最近日本企劃院總裁以談話形式發表七月十八日臨時閣議決定的戰時財經大計劃，其中關於日元集團貿易計劃，卽擬保持彼此國際收支的平衡，以謀日元經濟集團的健全發展，使日本與日元區域各地物資的交流能够圓滑，求得日系通貨的穩固，物價的安定。這項計劃的三要點是：（一）在不妨礙日本維持第三個輸出的進展，以及國民生活所需的範圍，日本供給元系地區的物資數量，在當地情形許可中，當盡量使其增多；（二）爲適應各地消費統制方針及維持元系通貨方策，對於物資的交流，應選擇適當的措置；（三）對於　系地區的貿易出超，如何計謀它的國際收支的平衡。</p>
<p>然而不管在這一計劃之下，將有什麼措施，它於日本因對元系地區的出超而生的貿易上的困厄，還是無法减少，相反地因爲計劃中第一點原則，而可使對元系地區的出超　爲加大。須知日本在華的侵略戰爭繼續不停止，則元系通貨一日膨脹一日，可是元系通貨雖能在槍刺之下行使出去，而它的價值底維持，却不是槍刺所能盡力，惟有期於輸出物品方能產生它的交換價值，結果元系通貨盡量膨脹，對元系地區輸出愈多，出超亦愈大。個人此處可勿　言，提供一種統計以作推論，下表是日本對外貿易指數（以一九三七年上半年為一百）：</p>
<h3>紗花　棉紗投機復活　雙馬回漲十一元</h3>
<p>紗市轉好、又見上升、此因上日午後外匯改縮，人心激昂、於是投機又復掀風作浪、熱气沸騰、多頭方面重振旗鼓而來、高價曾到九百九十九元、旋聞實際銷場並未十分暢健、而某一大戶多頭反爲出籠、而轉下落矣、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、因上日午後金價稍高、一般多方大爲鼓吹、塲中人氣熱烈、開價卽漲二十元、二十支雙馬價爲九百九十元、卽刻漲至九有九十九元、旋以客帮交易不旺、匯票轉鬆放長、人氣忽軟、跌至九百八十三元、查半日間成交統計千三百七十包、行情二十支　馬漲十一元、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<h3>現棉交易微稀</h3>
<p>現棉交易大勢仍屬平凡、廠胃不强、日廠雖有零星需要、然付款期限仍遲緩一月、華廠鑒於環境平常、決無購藏之念、實則銀根亦未鬆懈也、僅同行偶有抵解交易談妥、市面亦不離徘徊局面也、通州花一百七十元、美棉二百六十元、成交三四百件棧交、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、市况良好、同業稍有購買、華爾街股票價高、及一部份之空頭抵補、結果收盤價格較之上日漲四五磅音、印度市况平靜、昨日連同預測跌落一羅比餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來殊見靜寂、各方俱因月終關係、咸抱觀望、昨日又因滙兌之緊、人心因之堅定、</p>
<h3>油餅　豆餅內銷蟬聯</h3>
<p>豆餅市面、自上週末轉呈活潑狀態以來、內地銷塲蟬聯不懈、兼之豆價昂挺、所以市氣得强有力之扶持、市價益起騰踊、昨雖出口無問津、但行情仍抬砌三四角不等、計開甡記餅三千片、價爲十一元、昌記餅一百片、價爲十元零五角半、肥字餅一千二百片、價爲十元零九角半至八角、靑中餅一千五百片、價爲十元零二角至十元云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布現銷仍佳</h3>
<p>昨日布市始漲繼疲、結果又見回昂、呈盤旋局面、售盤上落範圍已窄、高低祇一角半、現銷仍屬良好、執貨者意態亦頗鎭定、惟存底依然極厚、期貨交易買戶殊乏興趣、本街成交現貨粗布坯布漂染布五百餘件、期貨絨布二百餘件、閩帮辦色斜。色布·嗶嘰一百餘件、粵港帮辦斜紋·色布·近二百件、溫甬帮辦綸昌色布怡和斜紋粗布近百件、北路烟津帮辦粗布絨布一百數十件、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗車白漲二元許</h3>
<p>昨糖市因外傳荷屬東印度形勢惡劣、荷糖來源防有阻礙、故公會劃盤爲之步漲、現貨二四粗白本棧六十七元半至六十八元半方外棧初爲六十七元三角至五角、下午更升至六十八元及六十八元半、轉口貨八月二日交割爲五十一元半至五十一比八角、下午五十二元至五十三元、十五日交割五十二元半至五十三四元、太古車白B嘜上午七十二元半至七十三元、下午七十三元半至七十四元、荷赤本棧六十一元半、本廠雪白六十八元至六十九元、升二元半、本一號冰九十元、晶明冰九十一元半、均升三元、又糖昨由香港來五千九百包、又來四千包、轉往天津、</p>
<h3>海味　黑椒跌二元</h3>
<p>黑胡椒近以去化仍淡、續見下游、黑大及一號椒又小二元、昨售一百零一元、惟白椒仍穩、文島貨二百零二元、荷蘭貨）百九十元、</p>
<h3>南北貨　海口枝到三千餘箱</h3>
<p>海口枝登新後、因某方封鎖浙閩海口、此間號方曾電產區止裝、但第三批已運出在途、昨已由慶元輪運到共計三千三百餘箱、日內或可啟盤云、</p>
<h3>五金　美條鐵行市堅</h3>
<p>美條鐵交易、外埠客商早停納胃、其所能支持殘局者、僅靠本街玩具廠·印刷廠·香烟廠及製罐廠等時有採辦、然銷胃亦已大非昔比、（蓋其出品貨銷塲呆滯故也）、查昨成交百數箱、行盤昨因外滙又見回緊、人心隨見昂挺、依然堅定、如昨喊價統花色一百二十元、大尺寸一百三四十元不等、小花色則每箱售一百零數元左右、</p>

<p>地保</p>
<p>地保之法，起於宋時王荊公之新法，其法本於周禮，鄕立一人以為之，蓋卽保甲之法變而通之者也。故新法皆悉罷去，而保甲之法，至今沿之，卽地保之設，亦至今仍之。味其命名之義，所謂地保者，謂此地為其所保，先時創立之始，大約必須一鄕之稍有名望者為之，其後漸失古意，而鄕間地保，每多游手無籍之人，充當其數，而地保之設，遂無益而有損。沿至今日，去古愈遠，人心愈壞，而地方保甲愈趨愈下，其弱者頂名充數，一無能為；其强者則交結官差，私通胥吏，或曰縣中某頭腦其親戚也，衙前某先生其好友也，鄕愚無知，以為與官府聲氣相通，不敢少有觸犯，以罹咎戾；於是乎擅作威福，魚肉鄕閭，每節須送節規者有之，做壽分帖苛派禮物者有之，稍有事端，便生枝葉，肆其貪狼之性，逞其狡兎之謀，其在名鄕望族，或尚歛跡而不敢恣肆，倘在窮鄉僻壤，去城較遠，官府耳目有所不及，則若輩更肆無忌憚，無所不為矣。</p>

<h3>信任與認識</h3>
<p>信任與認識，是有連帶關係的。有多少認識，就有多少信任·信任與不信任，全在乎認識與不認識。人與人交際往來，都是如此。我對某人有認識就有信任，認識越淸楚，信任心也越大。</p>
<p>全世界所有的糾紛，無論是國際的，國家的，家庭的，或是個人與個人的，都是由於沒有認識上帝，沒有信任上帝，沒有尊崇上帝，讓上帝做我們的主，做我們的王。同時也是因爲把自己看得太重，「我」要這樣，「我」要那樣，一個「我」，兩個「我」，這「我」字積得比泰山還高。無論甚麼事，總是憑「我」的聰明「我」的才幹，「我」的交際手腕，把上帝趕到九霄雲外，心目之中完全沒有上帝。</p>
<p>從前許多信仰上帝的詩人，在他們所寫的詩裏都是說：「我倚靠上帝，必不懼怕，血氣之輩能把我怎樣呢…」（詩五十六　）「上帝阿！求你憐憫我，憐憫我，因爲我的心投靠你，我要投靠在你的蔭下，等到災害過去…」（詩五十七　）</p>
<p>讀者諸君！我們相信宇宙之中有一位上帝，我們認識他，信任他，從縱的方面看，基督敎兩千年來，有無數的信徒，因爲認識這位上帝，信任這位上帝，成就了許多偉大的事工，縱橫的方面看，今日世界各國，雖然戰事是這樣的瀰漫，但基督敎的宣敎事業，敎育事業，醫藥事業，以及其他種種慈善工作，因爲認識這位上帝，信任這位上帝，仍是毫不灰心的向前進行。</p>
<p>你也願意認識這位上帝，以致認識了他以後，在你的生活各方面信任他的領導，不再患得患失，做一個堅忍不拔的人嗎？（八月四日再登）</p>

<h3>兒童敎育基本原則</h3>
<p>— 編著</p>
<p>有許多人好意而簡單地問：『要怎樣敎育兒童？』這眞是一件說來話長的事，幾乎無從答起。不過這裏有些兒童敎育的基本原則，也許可以做有心父母的參考資料：</p>
<p>（一）溫和，忍耐，堅定，不惱怒，不發脾氣。</p>
<p>（二）一切爲兒童的利益及前途而着想，賞罰嚴明公正。</p>
<p>（三）不怕哭。</p>
<p>（四）以鼓勵代替禁止。</p>
<p>（五）盡量减少責罰，責罰時必須態度公允，並使兒童明白其錯誤的所在。</p>
<p>（六）問題發生時，須立卽或儘早予以解決，非必要時切勿拖延。</p>
<p>（七）勿在他人面前斥責子女。切勿傷及兒童的自尊心。</p>
<p>（八）幫助兒童做事，須適可而止，以培養兒童自動自立爲目的。</p>
<p>（九）一貫的態度。</p>
<p>（十）父母態度一致。</p>
<p>（十一）做好榜樣。</p>
<p>（十二）把小孩當做一個懂事的人。</p>
<p>家庭</p>
<h3>十條公約</h3>
<p>— 望川</p>
<p>昨天收到兩封編輯先生轉來的自由談讀者的信，說是讀過拙作「我祝福弟弟」一文後，很覺羨慕我有這樣的一個弟弟，並且希望我將我和弟弟的十條公的能公佈在自由談上。現在我已徵得了弟弟的同意，將牠抄上一份，並且加上一些說明。</p>
<p>（一）訂的人不得購買洋貨，不得已時除外；</p>
<p>（二）到學校或出外時，不得坐頭等電車；</p>
<p>（三）訂約日起，抗戰勝利止，不得看電影和戲劇，有意義者除外；</p>
<p>（四）訂約人必須學特別技能兩種（一年內）；</p>
<p>（五）每月零用錢約十分之二要買課外書看；</p>
<p>（六）每天要看報；</p>
<p>（七）每天要寫日記；</p>
<p>（八）不凖和阿玲吵嘴</p>
<p>（九）不得每天下棋來消磨有用的時間；</p>
<p>（十）不准吸香烟。</p>
<p>以上的十條是在去年四月裏訂定的，離現在有一年以上，在這一年內，起先我們都非常留意，惟恐自己觸犯了公約，及到三四月之後，我們也就習慣了。例如拿坐電車來說吧，等到電車一到站，我便會不加思索地踏進三等車廂，就是在路上遇見了朋友，也不覺有什麼不自然。</p>
<p>這個公約中有幾條，完全是為了適合弟弟和我而訂定的。例如第六條，阿玲是我家的女傭，她有一張多管閑事和搬弄是非的嘴，因之，以前弟弟常和她吵嘴。這一條可以說是偏於限制弟弟的。其他像吸烟和下棋之類是我的缺點，公約上也就是爲我而訂定的。</p>
<p>當我和弟弟「開會」商訂公約的時候，弟弟也曾提出過誰犯了的如何處罰的問題，弟弟和我在經濟方面都還沒有自立，於是我想出了一個精神責罰法。就是誰犯了公約，誰就得默坐一小時，在道一小時內，祗許坐着懺悔，不准開口。這法子是經我們採用了，並且實騐下來非常有效。</p>
<p>對方犯了的時，自己切不可幸災樂禍，反而要顯出原諒他這次的意思，並勸他下次不要再犯，這樣讓對方覺得精神上有一種責備，此後決不會輕易再犯了。父母對子女的責罰，我想也可用這法子。</p>
<h3>平常</h3>
<p>— 方靜</p>
<p>有許多人都忽視平常。</p>
<p>但我們說：平常當中有學問。</p>
<p>試看，瓦特發明蒸氣，不是從燒水道一平常當中碰到的嗎？牛頓發明地心吸力，不是從蘋果掉下地上這一平常當中求得的嗎？</p>
<p>平常當中有學問，願大家注意平常！</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小靑著</p>
<p>「霍桑，這時還祇九點半鐘。姜安娜回來不過睡了兩個鐘頭，我們去叫醒伊，未免不近情理。」</p>
<p>霍桑縐了縐眉。「那也顧不得，事情很緊急，不能躭擱太久。我祇希望跟伊談十五分鐘，伊儘可以再睡。」</p>
<p>我們已找到三〇六號室的門前。霍桑略一疑遲，就曲了他右手的食指，在門上了三下。裏面沒有回音。我瞧門旁也沒有電鈴，我也就舉起拳頭幫助他敲了兩下。回音果然來了。</p>
<p>「誰？———誰敲門？」</p>
<p>那聲音宏亮而急促，明明含着些驚恐意味。</p>
<p>我詫異地低聲說：「這是男子聲音啊！不會弄錯嗎？」</p>
<p>霍桑搖搖頭。「這也值得詫異？你聽不出這是從睡夢中驚醒的聲音嗎——倒霉！」他說完了旋轉身子，預備向後轉了。</p>
<p>裏面又有第二種聲音「是誰？什麼事？」這是女子聲音了。我又說：「是安娜啊。你爲什麼走？」</p>
<p>霍桑突然沉下了臉。「我們進去做什麼？…唉，糜爛的上海，可詛咒的第六倫！」他迅速地向電梯間走去，臉上浮出一種惱恨和悽悲，嘴裏吐出一陣深長的嘆息。</p>
<p>霍桑再沒有下文，但我也已領會到。我眞覺得掃興，也不禁暗暗地嘆息着：「可詛咒的」第六倫！」</p>
<p>當我們走下了公寓的石階，霍桑用鑰匙開車門的時候，我又問他。「我們回去嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，去找趙伯雄。」</p>
<p>「你也知道他的住所嗎」？因爲剛才金梅和老毛吳媽談話的時候，都不會提起趙伯雄的住址，霍桑也不曾問過。（六二）</p>
<p>兒童</p>
<h3>掙扎</h3>
<p>— 品品</p>
<p>流淚撒種的，必歡呼收割。那帶種流淚出去的，必要歡歡樂樂的帶禾捆回來。</p>
<p>——「詩篇」一二六</p>
<p>人生是需要磨鍊的，人生是個掙扎。</p>
<p>譬如一粒種子，埋在冰冷的地底，北風打着牠，雨雪淹溺牠，這是一個多麼大的困難；但牠不怕磨鍊，咬牙掙扎，度過冬天，種子衝破一切萌出芽，陽光第一次給牠洗禮，這又是一個多麼大的喜悅。如果種子受不住嚴寒，牠將永久在黑暗裏。——人生就是那麼一粒掙扎的種子。</p>
<p>冬天是長的，不過春天總要到來；苦難也許是沉重的，不過快樂總一步一步向你走近。我們能說世界上有沉重的苦難，假使你知道掙扎，困難就給你挑開，而你將發現壓進的洞裏原來是顆快樂的寳石。你想得到寳石嗎？你先得學會吃苦。</p>
<p>你得有一雙生老繭的手，一雙起泡而紅腫的脚，一個創痕斑斑的胸，一個沒有口液的嘴（你在人生的沙漠上顚躓，以及一顆駱駝的心：這些便是你的武裝，在人生的戰塲上。拖過一千斤的重車，走過一千里的荊棘路，受過一千次的鞭打，叫過一千遍的杭育，你的苦够受了吧—瞧呀，那邊一片綠洲！</p>
<p>掙扎，跌倒再爬起，再掙扎，前邊便是樂園。這是一條漫長的途程，可是一到目的地，光榮的皇冕便加在你的頭頂</p>
<p>我不承認嬰孩不要掙扎，你看他怎樣抓東西，學走路。許多人想學嬰孩的樣，以爲有不須掙扎的快樂，這是錯覺，除非你學腐屍——腐屍是可咒詛的，快回頭學過冬的種子吧。</p>
<p>所謂駱駝的心呢，就是不動搖。」沙漠上有蜃樓，當心，牠雖不是物質的困難，却是一個對於精神的引誘。一生中不知多少個惡毒的引誘跳躍四周，你不能動搖，吾則，你的命運是鈞上的魚兒。駱駝不顧蜃樓，以沉着堅毅的步子走去：你必須這樣。一旦你有不可動搖的精神，任何引誘不能鈎到你，你怕什麼呢，勇敢的人，你的精神也加了甲胄。</p>
<p>一切的格言，童話，敎條，傳記，都講這同樣的事：掙扎，之後是勝利。你現在在流淚嗎？謝謝牠，你將因此笑了。我們不定地掙扎，我們翻身的時候也到了。衝破困難，踢開引誘，掙扎着，解放出現了，你說對嗎？</p>
<h3>孩子頌</h3>
<p>— 秀碧</p>
<p>不知道從什麼時候起，我成了一個喜歡和孩子們一起遊戲，一起生活的人了。</p>
<p>天眞的感情，純潔的心，沒有欺詐，也沒有機謀。</p>
<p>在他們心中的字典裏，沒有虛僞，在他們單純的微笑裏，沒有暗藏着的刀。</p>
<p>他們跳躍，他們歌唱，他們想說什麼話就是說什麼話，他們不知道譏諷，他們不知道口是心非。他們也不知道保藏自己的秘密。</p>
<p>他們是常常把世上的一切人也都視作和他們一樣的無邪不欺的。他們怎知道道塵世的罪惡早已使成人們失去了誠實和無欺？因之他們容易受欺和受騙。</p>
<p>他們也常常是愛眞理的，在他們幼稚的言語中，往往流露着不朽的眞理，他們愛國家，愛自由，愛世上一切的善良和美麗。</p>
<p>他們又是常常愛光明的，他們遇見了黑暗就哭泣或抖戰，遇見了光亮就歡笑或跳躍，他們是光明的戀人，黑暗和魔鬼的仇敵。</p>
<p>啊！孩子們啊！自從我在人世間遭逢了太多的欺騙後，我竟成了你們至好的侶伴了，你們的天眞，留住了我的童心。</p>

<h3>桃樂賽拉摩</h3>
<p>— 文</p>
<p>桃樂賽拉摩非但擅演戲，還會寫文章，以前報章雜誌時有刊載她關於美容與健身的文字。最近發表了一篇自白式的短文，雖則另具宣傳的副作用，但不無相當的價値，特譯之於後:</p>
<p>在任何一都我主演的片子中，我都與美國完全脫離關係，譬如說：在獸國女皇，獸國情侶，水火島和南國之春中，我始終圍上了一條紗籠，漂流在熱帶的荒島上。北海漁光一片，我是在阿拉斯加，南國女兒一片，我是在墨西哥，馬德里末次車中，我是在西班牙。但無論如何，我却是生在紐奧侖斯的人，而且還是祖先數代居此的呢。</p>
<p>電影的爲人類欣賞，是不分國族的，按理好萊塢自應儘量攝製世界性的電影；不過像鐵馬，亂世鴛鴦，和簡單的哈代與瓊斯家庭片，都是純粹「美國式」的片子，但均爲各國所歡迎。</p>
<p>所以我希望有機會也主演一部美國式的片子，這或許是我有一些眼紅，因為像瑪黛林卡洛爾兒，曼兒曼勃朗等英國女明星，她們在好萊塢的片子中總是飾演美國的女子。這並不是我想排斥「來路貨」，因為好萊塢優秀的演員來自國外的，實在指不勝屈，公司方面也絕對不會做出諸如此類愚笨的舉動來，但我以爲以美國人扮演美國人，終究是一個好意見</p>
<h3>孤島的粵劇</h3>
<p>— 力士</p>
<p>粵劇的根據地，多在粵港澳等處。其他的分佈在南洋如新加坡等粵僑衆多的地方。至於在上海，「一二八」前，粵劇上演常在虬江路廣舞臺。「八「三」前，則在北四川路廣東大戲院，和在福生路之明珠大戲院（後改爲海珠大戲院）虬江路口之上海大戲院亦曾演過多時。八一三戰事後，夸劇團遂紛作南歸。嗣後因在港之粵劇協會，禁止劇團於淪陷區上演。故戰事西遷，滬地淪陷，劇團久未重游此地。只有永安業餘劇團演過救難粵劇直至去年，才有兩三藝員來滬閑遊，遂組成一「人壽年」班，假座更新舞臺上演多時。後因組織不良，人材缺乏，與房屋問題，故只曇花一現的演過幾時。及至今春，又組一班「大羅天」粵劇團，只因戲台狹少，座位不適，（因爲只是假座大中華飯店的小劇塲）故慘淡經營延至今日，又重遷至逍遙舞廳中的小劇塲中開演。</p>
<p>粵劇的在上海，只能給粵僑觀看。外鄉人看來簡直絲毫不懂，故雖技藝高深，噪喉動聽，亦只能給粵僑獨賞，未能像平劇的能給大衆領略。又因粵劇唱詞特殊，故若招徠外省人士觀摩，惟一辦法，須將唱詞印就分發，令人對照觀聽，免使戲劇文化，彼此隔膜。</p>
<h3>舊影新抄</h3>
<p>— 羅村</p>
<p>第一部國產片上發音有聲片是「雨過天靑」，係華光公司出品，民國二十年七月一日在新光大戲院公映。</p>
<p>第一部西洋有聲片是「飛行將軍」（CapatainSwaggeo）民國十八年二月在夏令配克大戲院公映—卽現今之大華。</p>
<p>上海最早的電影院是「虹口大戲院」，係西人雷馬斯（Lamos）所創立。</p>
<p>爲了廣告排名先後，而與公司起爭吵最早的是徐琴芳。</p>
<p>八年前敎育電影協會舉行國產片比賽，結果「人道」被列人第一名。</p>
<p>民國二十二年六月，范朋克夫婦來我國，擬赴西藏拍攝影片，經我國政府當局拒絕而作罷。</p>
<p>民國二十二年四月，羅明佑在馬尼拉開設聯華大戲院，開慕之日幷由紫羅蘭，陳燕燕登臺表演，盛况空前。</p>
<p>已故女星阮玲玉，當出殯時，有二萬餘影迷自動參加送喪，當時盛况亦可算得空前了。</p>
<h3>紹興同鄉會主辦　募款平糶遊藝大會</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>大家知道這一次紹與的米荒，閙得相當嚴重，直到現在，紹屬七縣的民食恐慌，還沒有解除。因此，紹興旅滬同鄉會爲救濟同鄉起見，除向各界奔走呼籲而外，自八月一日起，至四日爲止，假座卡爾登大戲院舉行遊藝慕款平糶大會四天。照預定遊藝節目，一二兩日是越劇會串，三四兩日是平劇會串。</p>
<p>關於越劇，已排定一日日戲「沉香扇」，夜戲「梁祝哀史」。二日日戲「盤夫索夫」，夜戲「碧玉簪」。演員有姚水娟，屠杏花，商芳臣，竺素娥，施銀花，馬樟花，王水花，呂勝奎，李小儂，邢竹琴等二十餘人</p>
<p>平劇的戲單，已排定三日日戲爲「奔月」，「取洛陽」，「陰陽河」，「轅門斬子」，「雅觀樓」，「割髮代首」。夜戲「五花洞」，「老將得勝」，「穆柯寨」，「九更天」，「別窰」，「夜戰馬超」，「寳蓮燈」，「劈山救母」。四日日戲「鐵弓緣」，「海潮珠」，「龍鳳呈祥」，「八大鎚」。夜戲「彩樓配」，「伐東吳」，「宋十回」，「四平山」，鴻驚禧</p>
<p>演員如周信芬，趙如泉，李如春，毛世來，艾世菊，張翼鵬，馮子和，王熙春，黃桂秋，袁世海，姜妙香，等二十餘人。</p>
<p>就上面所排的戲目，我們不難看出不拘是越劇或乎劇，都根精彩。據說各界熱心人士，這一次購券非常踴躍。同樣是看戲，這一回却可救活不少紹興同胞，何况由名伶串演名劇，旣飽眼福，又救難胞，一舉兩得，眞是何樂不爲呢！</p>

<h3>怎樣攝制電影？　（三）</h3>
<p>— 德綱</p>
<p>（四）開麥拉的運用和技巧攝影師將開麥拉的轉盤搖動時，便將演員的動作攝入片內，我們依據物理和光學的研究，知道若在普通人眼前，每秒鐘移動十六張或以上的盡片，那麼眼睛將不感斷續，開麥拉的結構便依據這個原理。它在正常節奏下每秒可攝片十六張，卽相當轉盤旋轉兩次。攝影師若將轉盤速率加快，每秒旋轉四次，那麼攝成片中人物的動作都是「慢動作」演員的一舉一動都較普通慢一倍，這也可說是愛因斯坦相對學說的推例。若相反，攝影師將盤搖慢，那麼片中的人物動作都特別加快例如舉我們在普通片中常見的一個情節：一個盜駕了一輛汽車飛馳後面跟了許多巡警拼命地駕了機器脚踏車狂追，他們飛也似的速度，看了使人心驚，其實這完全是攝影的技巧而已。原來扮演强盜巡警的演員在拍戲時，都慢吞吞地駕了車極緩前行，不過攝影師將轉盤特別慢搖，使動作好像變成劇快，除了這方法外，若將每兩片中剪去一片也能使動作好像加快。</p>
<p>還有我們在影片中，時常看見當一幕將畢，而進入另一不同幕時，第一幕的人，物，漸漸像霧樣消失，而第二幕的人物則逐漸稍稍透視，這也是靠運用開麥拉技巧而得。方法很簡單，在攝近第一慕未時，攝影師將鏡頭暗門漸漸關閉，所以人物漸漸的像消失。將鏡頭暗門漸行開放，於是第二幕的人物漸漸透現，不知道的人，覺得這是非常神秘而有趣的事。</p>

<h3>Bitter Defeat Inflicted, Routed on All Sides, No Japanese Traces Near Quli, Chinese Forces Continue Expanding Victories in Places like Huake, Shibu, and Longtou, Guangdong Southern Chinese Army Launches Surprise Attack, Fierce Fighting in Guangdong East</h3>
<p>Guilin: Japanese troops near Quli suffered a bitter defeat at the hands of the Chinese army, incurring heavy casualties. On the evening of the 26th, they were routed in two directions: one retreating to Shanxu, the other to Suilu. Currently, there are no traces of the Japanese army near Quli. (Dispatch of the 31st)</p>
<p>Wuming: After the Chinese army captured Shibu, Laokou, and Yangmei northwest of Nanning, as well as Longtou and other places west of Nanning, they proceeded to clear out the remaining Japanese troops in the vicinity, securing these strongholds and continuing to expand their victories. The Japanese troops harassing Funan are extremely panicked due to the severed transportation on the Yifu Road. On the 19th, they gathered a force in an attempt to counterattack Longtouxu, but were intercepted by the Chinese army near Tanxi, southwest of Longtou. The Japanese momentum was immediately thwarted, and the Chinese army, capitalizing on the victory, charged forward, advancing towards Funan. (Dispatch of the 30th)</p>

<h3>New Chinese Economic Policy Achieves Significant Success</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Following the recent resolution of the Seventh Plenary Session to establish an Economic Warfare Department, the National Government authorities are now actively engaged in preparations. President Chiang recently declared that in the fourth year of the war of resistance, military efforts would only account for 30%, while economic efforts should account for 70%. This view is shared by figures in both military and political circles. In this regard, the National Government has achieved significant success in Sichuan Province since implementing the new economic policy. For example, three years ago, there were only 30 small-scale power plants throughout the province, with a generating capacity of only 5,000 kilowatts. Recently, Yuzhong City alone has a power plant with a generating capacity of 12,000 kilowatts, and the generating capacity of various private factories, 8,000 kilowatts, is not yet included. Currently, the National Resources Commission is adding five power plants in the province. Furthermore, Sichuan Province had no metallurgical furnaces before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, but now has twelve new-style metallurgical furnaces, including one with a capacity of 100 tons and two with a capacity of 25 tons under construction. In addition, the production of pig iron and the machinery industry have also made progress. As for the manufacture of munitions, in addition to the national armories, there are also many private small-scale factories currently engaged in production. (Havas dispatch of the 31st)</p>

<h3>Japanese Planes Attack the Capital Again Yesterday, Beipei Hot Springs Bombed, Five Planes Shot Down One After Another</h3>
<p>Chongqing: This afternoon, several batches of Japanese planes were found flying towards Chongqing, so an alarm was issued. The first batch of Japanese planes bombed Beipei Hot Springs, the second batch bombed Tongliang on the Ji Rong Highway northwest of Chongqing, and the third and fourth batches heavily bombed the western suburbs of Chongqing. However, because the bombs dropped mostly landed in open areas, the number of casualties was very minor. The anti-aircraft artillery did not open fire to allow Chinese fighter planes to intercept. The alarm was lifted at 4:30 PM. (Reuters dispatch of the 31st)</p>
<p>Chongqing: At 2:30 PM this afternoon, the outskirts of Chongqing City were again bombed by three waves of Japanese planes. Bombs fell like rain, and a large number of houses were destroyed. Japanese planes also attacked various towns near Chongqing today, such as Tongliang, 50 miles northeast of Chongqing City, and Beipei, 50 miles due north, which were both tragically bombed.

<h3>Most of Henan Province Still in Chinese Hands</h3>
<p>Beiping: Today, travelers arriving here mentioned the difficulties encountered by the Japanese army in Henan Province, currently fighting against a large number of Chinese regular troops and guerrillas. Recently, the Japanese army attacked north from the Henan-Hubei border in an attempt to trap the Chinese army, using at least 250,000 troops, aided by tanks and aircraft. However, after fighting for several months, both sides suffered heavy casualties, and no progress was made. Most of Henan Province is still in the hands of the Chinese army. The main reason is that the Japanese army's forces are insufficient to cope. Almost every Chinese person encountered by the travelers in Henan possesses weapons. Although the equipment of the Chinese army is inferior to that of the Japanese army, their morale is very high and their discipline is good. They currently use mule carts to transport munitions. China seems to be relying on these for transportation. (Reuters dispatch of the 31st)</p>
<h3>Postage Increased</h3>

Domestic letters, which cost five cents, will be increased to ten cents, and foreign letters, which cost thirty cents, will be increased to sixty cents. (Associated Press dispatch of the 31st)</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Police in Tianjin Question Chinese and British People</h3>
<p>Tianjin: Japan's "espionage terror" has recently spread throughout North China. Chinese and British people in this area and in Beidaihe, a northeastern Tianjin summer resort, have been interrogated by Japanese military police. The arrests of British spy suspects that began in Tokyo last Saturday have recently spread to Tianjin. Two British and forty Chinese people have been forced to be interrogated by Japanese military police. Without waiting for the permission of the British authorities, Japanese military police entered the British concession and questioned a British woman and a British military officer. However, these two people were only questioned and not taken to the military police headquarters. Also, a British military officer in Beidaihe was also questioned by Japanese military police, but there have been no arrests or mistreatment of British people. This Japanese action began this morning. The forty Chinese people questioned were Salvation Army officials, all of whom were summoned to the military police headquarters. It is reported that they have all been released. (Associated Press dispatch of the 31st)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Britain on the Wrong Path</h3>
<p>It has been said that "everything in the East will never be understood by Westerners." This is naturally an exaggeration, but if this is used to explain Britain's current diplomacy towards Japan, it seems to hit the nail on the head. Counting the things in the contemporary international community that have been laborious and unsuccessful, nothing is more so than Britain's diplomacy towards Japan. People like Craigie, who have been busy all year round, have never had the slightest gain. Their constant concern for improving Anglo-Japanese relations is much like the bluebird in a fairy tale, always transforming into the opposite thing at the moment of reaching it. This is not due to the clumsiness of British diplomatic skills. The main problem is that the old ideas of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance era still exist in Britain, so it cannot have a correct understanding of the current situation in the Far East.</p>
<p>Recently, the British authorities have repeatedly rejected Germany's "peace" proposals, indicating that they no longer have any illusions of compromise, but this is a conclusion exchanged at a great price. Two years ago - even a year ago, Britain's attitude was not so firm. And in the Far East, even though many prices have been paid, delusional fantasies still dominate the entire foreign policy. In the ambition of the British rulers, it is roughly thought that: first, Britain is at a critical juncture of life and death, and cannot increase frontal enemies; second, only concession can be exchanged for Japan's well-intentioned neutrality; third, the policy of concession can help the rise of moderate elements in Japan and prevent the recklessness of extremist elements in Japan. None of these are following the traditional ideas of the old era; following tradition, they ignore some new factors - such as China's resistance - and are not taken into consideration. Therefore, on the one hand, Japan is overestimated, and an inexplicable fear arises when hearing official reports of Japan joining the German and Italian sides; on the other hand, Japan is underestimated, and the fantasy that Britain's concession can influence Japan's national policy. In fact, the anti-British movement in Japan began before the outbreak of the European War, and Britain's retreat to Japan was not implemented only during the war against Germany. Therefore, the problems between Britain and Japan are currently related to the war in Europe, but in fact they are two separate things, and they are not necessarily as close as the figures in Downing Street imagine. And Japan's basic foreign policy is determined by the sum of the desires and strengths of the Japanese rulers themselves and the international relations of all parties, and is not influenced solely by the strong attitude of the British side. From the Anglo-Japanese Customs Agreement to the recent blockade of the Burma Road, every concession made by the British side has only resulted in more insults and greater threats. This time, the concession regarding the Burmese Road was less than ten days ago, and a large number of British overseas Chinese were arrested, and Cox's tragic death was promoted. Even if this is not frivolously regarded as Britain's own reward, it should at least make the British government and people seriously reflect.</p>
<p>Among the major powers related to the Far East, Britain is the most polite to Japan, and the most impolite are the United States and the Soviet Union. However, battles such as Zhanggufeng and Nomonhan, the abolition of commercial treaties, and embargoes have not provoked fierce retaliation from Japan. In the recent Konoe policy, it is said that the United States and the Soviet Union are important targets for Japan to adjust diplomatic relations. Britain has made the most concessions and given the most help to Japan, but it has only been hit repeatedly. The so-called promotion of friendship is still far away. Of course, Britain is currently at war, restraining Condor, and cannot move as freely as the United States and the Soviet Union; but a month ago, it was precisely when Britain was in a very dangerous situation, and Japan was unable to do anything. Currently, Britain's position has made significant progress, and its diplomatic operations have also made considerable progress. Why should it be so unnecessarily afraid of the shadows?</p>
<p>Now, London seems to have recognized the seriousness of the arrest of British overseas Chinese, and the public has also issued calls for retaliation, but it is still questionable whether the mistakes and prejudices of many years can be fundamentally eliminated by temporary stimulation. It must be known that this arrest of British overseas Chinese was carried out under the orders of the Japanese government, that is, the action of the Japanese government, and it may even be determined that it is part of the cabinet policy that Konoe is preparing to announce today. This is not like the previous anti-British movement in Japan, which can be blamed on the invading Chinese soldiers, and under the so-called "new system" regime in Japan, there will no longer be a confrontation between moderates and radicals. Britain's traditional view of the Far East has become completely outdated. If it does not adapt to the new reality and make a thorough transformation, sooner or later Britain will inevitably be forced to withdraw from the Far East. Don't you see that in the basic policy outline of Japan's new cabinet that was recently reported, Burma and India have been included in the scope of implementing Japan's ideals to build the Greater East Asia?</p>
<p>Previously, Britain's blockade of freight traffic on the Burmese Road was excused by the United States' unwillingness to provide Britain with a guarantee of assistance. This explanation may be accepted without reservation; then, since the US attitude is now firm and unambiguous, and new pressure has been re-applied to Britain, will Britain continue its policy of appeasement to inflict suffering on itself, or will it rein in its horses and change its course, it all depends on how the British authorities recognize this incident and how they choose to use it.</p>
<h3>After Representatives Sign the Treaty, the Pan-American Conference Declares its Closing, Secretary of State Hull Issues a Statement, the Achievements of the Conference are Economic Self-Sufficiency</h3>
<p>Havana: After the representatives of various countries signed the final treaty, the Pan-American Conference was declared closed at 8:10 PM yesterday. Before leaving Havana last night, US Secretary of State Hull issued a statement summarizing the achievements of the conference, saying that this achievement is an economically self-sufficient organization, based on the principles of honesty, fairness, and friendship, for mutual interaction. At the same time, Hull also said that the American countries "have the absolute ability to defend their creeds." Cuban Secretary of State Quemba said in his farewell speech that there is no doubt that this conference has made a significant contribution to the goals of the Americas. (Associated Press dispatch of the 31st)</p>
<p>Havana: Before leaving here today, US Secretary of State Hull praised the American countries' decision to unite to protect the integrity of their countries. Hull told news reporters that the governments of the American countries have shown the world that their determination to firmly embrace the spirit and system of maintaining and strengthening continental unity is unwavering. Hull also sincerely and earnestly declared that no country in the Americas has the slightest intention of seizing land during the opportunity of the European War.</p>
<p>New York: Most of the radio commentators in the United States judged the outcome of the Pan-American Conference as an unquestionable victory for American politics. Some commentators said that the United States is the only country with the military power to implement the terms, which is why the United States has obtained a free hand in the defense of the Western Hemisphere. However, Williams said in his broadcast that the conference has not yet obtained what it hoped for regarding the issue of the transfer of ownership of European territories. If the method of American air force bases in Latin American countries south of the equator has not been properly negotiated, Americans cannot regard the overall situation as a success. (Reuters dispatch of the 31st)</p>
<p>Rome: Rogerio, a New York reporter for the Turin "Stember" newspaper, said that if any European country takes action against Dutch and French possessions in the Western Hemisphere, the United States is prepared to enter the war. Rogerio said that President Roosevelt and Republican candidate Willkie have the same views on the general impact of the European War. President Roosevelt and Willkie do not advocate intervention in the European War, but if the Dutch and French territories in the Americas are threatened, the United States will take action. (Associated Press dispatch of the 31st)</p>
<p>Main Contents of the Convention</p>
<p>Havana: The main points of the convention established by the Pan-American Conference are announced here as follows: (1) The American republics consider the fate of all territories of non-American countries in the Western Hemisphere and the situations that may occur that may destroy their sovereignty, and therefore unanimously condemn all acts of violence. (2) The republics recognize that the aforementioned transfer of sovereignty is contrary to the emotions and rights of the American countries to maintain their security and political independence, and therefore the American republics will not recognize or accept this transfer, regardless of its form. (3) The American republics reserve their right to determine whether any transfer affects the territory and political independence of the European countries in this hemisphere. (4) The American republics may establish temporary governments for the aforementioned territories until their actual governments are freely determined by their people. This action by the American republics does not contain the meaning of abolishing the principle of non-interference. If a temporary government is decided, the power will be exercised by one or several American countries. This measure is aimed at safeguarding the security of the American countries and the welfare of the people in the territories concerned. The convention continued to state the many rights that administrators must maintain, stating that open economic relations will be maintained by various countries on a mutual basis. The first government will be for a term of three years, which can be extended for a maximum of ten years. Local income will be used to maintain government expenses. The international committee responsible for local administration will be composed of one representative from each country that ratifies this agreement. Any contracting country may convene a meeting of this committee. All resolutions must be approved by two-thirds of all members of the committee. The convention does not have articles addressing the land disputes between European countries and American countries. This agreement will be implemented after two-thirds of the American republics have ratified it. This agreement reiterates the principle of the conference, allowing the immediate establishment of a temporary committee composed of one representative from each country, which can convene and conduct business with two-thirds of the members present. Argentina added a reservation, recognizing the Falkland Islands as part of Argentina's territory. (Reuters dispatch of the 31st)</p>
<h3>US Senate Military Committee Decides to Authorize the President to Summon the National Guard, President Roosevelt Reiterates his Belief in Compulsory Military Training</h3>
<p>Washington: The Senate Military Committee yesterday postponed voting on the compulsory service bill aimed at registering 42 million men aged 18 to 64 for service, but has decided to authorize President Roosevelt to summon the National Guard. The Senate Military Committee has temporarily approved the main points of the conscription bill, but there is currently a growing opposition to the bill inside and outside Congress. The committee has decided to consider limiting the age of those receiving active military training from the current 21 to 45 to 22 to 31. (Reuters dispatch of the 31st)</p>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt reiterated his belief in the enforcement of compulsory military training yesterday. The Senate Military Committee has already unanimously passed a proposal authorizing the President to mobilize the National Guard Reserve for one year of rigorous training. The President said that the current situation is different from when the United States could send troops abroad for training in 1917. Today, the security of our country lies in having an excellent army that can be deployed at any time. US Secretary of War General Marshall told the Senate Military Committee that if the United States needs an ideal army, it must actively train the people. He also believed that this cannot be completely dependent on people voluntarily enlisting. He said that although it is currently a "time of peace," "I believe that our country is in a dangerous period, and it would be a great crime to send inexperienced people abroad to fight."

<h3>British-Japanese Agreement on the Burma Road, Britain Did Not Give the Japanese Authorities in Burma the Right of Inspection</h3>

<h3>Vietnam Crisis: Only the US Can Resolve It; Vietnamese Governor-General Eager to Cooperate with the US; French Concerned About Sai Nguyen's Return to Japan</h3>
<p>Hanoi - French sources here today are paying close attention to the visit to Tokyo by Sai Nguyen, the leader of the Japanese monitoring group in Vietnam. They say Sai Nguyen's trip may indicate Japan's future attitude toward Vietnam. Sai Nguyen left here by plane on July 28 and is expected to return next week. The Japanese monitoring group in Vietnam now numbers nearly one hundred, and they are all paying attention to the possibility of developing Japanese-Vietnamese commercial relations. Tokyo and Washington both hope to cooperate with Vietnam to enable it to realize its difficult task of new economic independence, free from the influence of France's surrender to Germany. For Vietnam itself, it must find ways to maintain its currency and quickly find markets to sell its coal, tin, rubber, rice, silver, and other products, as the 26 million residents of Vietnam rely on these goods for their livelihood. At the same time, consumption of goods imported from abroad is rapid, and during this time of European war, in order to avoid supply depletion, it must rely on imports from the US and Japan to replenish them. Vietnam's new Governor-General, Major General Te Go, met with a United Press reporter yesterday and outlined the current dangerous situation. Although he did not want the reporter to quote him in the news, he allowed the reporter to state that the Vietnamese government believes that Vietnam can establish economic relations with the US, Japan, Australia, and China, allowing the French to maintain their position in the East. Vietnam is still waiting for a signal from Washington. The French representative in Washington is hoping that Washington can lift the "freeze" on French deposits so that it can purchase urgently needed American products. Although French champagne is still sold for two yuan a bottle in Vietnam, Vietnamese French people can immediately switch to drinking American wine, but the supply of American wine is extremely scarce. A landmark in Hanoi is a replica of the Statue of Liberty, gifted by the French in New York. The French, touched by the scene, sincerely hope that the US can decisively engage in mutually beneficial commercial and political cooperation with Vietnam, so that Vietnam can receive equal treatment from the US and Japan. Neutral parties here point out that unless the US quickly attends to the crisis in Vietnam, this colony will inevitably be forced to completely lean toward Japan for economic assistance. If this is the case, it will naturally be unavoidable to cede some political interests to Japan. French officials have now indicated to Japan that they are willing to exchange Vietnamese coal, tin, and rice for Japanese products, but they are still hesitant in drafting a plan, fearing that the result will be that Vietnam's currency will be controlled by the Japanese yen bloc.

<h3>British Believe the Japanese Arrest of British Nationals is a Serious Matter; Foreign Secretary Halifax Explained to the Japanese Ambassador; The Presumption of Guilt of Cox is Completely Unacceptable to Britain</h3>
<p>London - Foreign Secretary Halifax, in response to questions about Japan in the House of Lords today, said that on July 29, the Japanese Ministry of the Army and Ministry of Justice jointly announced that, in view of the increasing number of spies and conspiratorial organizations within and outside the country, the military police, under the guidance of prosecutors, began to arrest members of a nationwide British spy network on July 27. Such remarks by the Japanese government are undoubtedly groundless. As for the tragic death of Cox, the chief correspondent of Reuters in Tokyo, the Japanese announced that he died after falling from the third floor and that it seemed that during the investigation, the deceased knew that he could not escape punishment, so he committed suicide to end it all. The British government completely cannot accept this groundless presumption of guilt. The British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, has made serious representations to the Japanese Foreign Ministry. This morning, I asked the Japanese Ambassador to come and see me and made it clear to him that the British government has a serious view of the Japanese arrest of British nationals without any doubt. Furthermore, I am not at liberty to say anything more at this time. (Reuters telegram, July 30)</p>
<p>Japanese Spokesman Claims Rejection of British Protest</p>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma recently told foreign reporters that the Japanese government will refuse to consider any British protests regarding the Japanese arrest of British nationals suspected of espionage. Suma strongly stated that it would be a mistake to say that this sudden action by Japan was purely anti-British. It must be known that no matter what country's people, if they engage in espionage activities within Japan, the Japanese authorities must take action against them. When reporters asked whether Britain had protested to Japan about the Japanese arrest of British nationals, Suma replied in the affirmative, only saying that the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, may have raised the matter when he met with Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka on Monday. However, Suma also said that the talks between Matsuoka and Craigie on Monday were largely a continuation of the Japanese-British policy negotiations on Saturday and that Matsuoka had asked Craigie about some of the views held by Britain towards Japan.

<p>London - Reuters diplomatic correspondents have learned that the activities of Germans in Japan, which have influenced recent Japanese actions, have been revealed in London. When the Anti-Comintern Pact was concluded, one German, a member of the German secret police, entered the Japanese Ministry of Home Affairs. This person has a great influence on Japanese domestic affairs and exerts great pressure on Japanese newspapers. The Nazi Party has a branch in Japan, controlling the activities of all German expatriates, which is tacitly approved by the Japanese authorities. The number of German tourists and businessmen in Japan has greatly increased, and they have no special reason for traveling to Japan. (Reuters telegram, July 31)</p>
<p>British-Japanese Committee Considering Dissolution</p>
<p>London - It was learned here yesterday that as a result of Japan's large-scale arrest of British nationals, the British Federation of Industries is considering dissolving its current British-Japanese Committee in both Tokyo and London. This committee was established in 1936 with the aim of increasing mutually beneficial trade between Britain and Japan. One of the thirteen British nationals detained in Japan on suspicion of espionage is James, the chief representative of the committee in Japan. (United Press telegram, July 31)</p>
<p>London - Four of the British nationals arrested in Japan have been released, their names being Holt, Chairman of the British Association in Kobe; Jones of Nickel &amp; Lyons; Price of Butterfield &amp; Swire; and MacNaughton, a British businessman in Osaka and Honorary Consul of Greece. As another British national, Ely, the General Manager of Asahi Oil Company, has been arrested, the total number of British nationals currently detained is ten. (Reuters telegram, July 31)</p>
<p>London - The British government has recently received a report from the Tokyo Embassy that Holt, the General Manager of the Butterfield &amp; Swire company in Kobe and Chairman of the British Association, and Russell, a director of Nickel &amp; Lyons and Chairman of the Kobe International Committee (born in Osaka in 1878, published a book on the history of Japanese customs), have been released, but Ely, the General Manager of Yokohama Rising Sun Oil Company, has been arrested in succession.

<p>British Newspapers Condemn Japanese Actions</p>
<p>London - The British press has warned Japan that Japan's current pro-Axis policy and arrests of British nationals will lead to war between Britain and Japan. London's morning newspapers have unanimously written articles condemning Japan's mass arrests of British nationals and its agreement to form an alliance with Germany and Italy. The Times said that even if Japan's desire to build a so-called "new order" fails in China, the fact that Japanese foreign policy must always be dictated by warlords who attempt to bring Japan into war with other Pacific countries is still a shocking matter. The Daily Telegraph said, has Japan ever considered the possibility that the US and Britain might unite with each other to stop its aggressive activities? Has Japan ever considered that if a conflict occurs with Britain, the consequence will be the resumption of hostilities with the Soviet Union? The Daily Mail warned that Britain can no longer make concessions and will not tolerate Japan's arbitrary arrest of British nationals. (United Press telegram, July 31)</p>
<p>London - The Daily Express advocated immediately arresting a similar number of Japanese people in London and boycotting the import of Japanese goods into Britain. British intellectuals hinted at retaliatory measures and believed that the British government would find it necessary to re-examine its Far East policy.

<p>Chongqing Newspapers Sharply Comment on British Policy</p>
<p>Chongqing - Local newspapers here have written articles criticizing Britain in response to news of the tragic death of Cox, Reuters' correspondent in Japan, and the Japanese arrest of British nationals, saying that Cox's death and the Japanese arrest of British nationals are both direct results of Britain's conciliatory policy towards Japan. The Central Daily News also published a sharp editorial strictly commenting on British actions. The newspaper said that only ten days after the closure of the Burma Road, the tragic death of the British reporter and the arrest of thirteen British nationals have already occurred. Can the British Churchill government still remedy this situation with humble protests? "We dare to say that Cox's death and the arrest of thirteen people are all caused by the Burma Road agreement. The cunning British initially thought that the closure of the Burma Road would only harm China, but they did not know that what China suffers is only material loss, while Britain greatly loses its national prestige. Its foolishness is beyond reach. Britain should know that its recent humble behavior has already started Tokyo's gradual capture and killing of British people. (United Press telegram, July 31)</p>
<p>Commentary from New York and Berlin Newspapers</p>
<p>New York - The New York Times' editorial today, titled "Japan's Arrogance," said that the military arrogance of Japan is difficult for the West to understand. The Japanese plainclothes soldiers who invaded the Shanghai International Settlement were arrested by American sailors, which was considered an insult by the Japanese. When Washington indicated that it would no longer supply oil and iron to Japan to help it slaughter Chinese people, the Japanese were greatly angered. However, Japanese soldiers beating and insulting Westerners or kicking innocent Chinese people, and Japanese people in Shanghai beating and arresting foreigners on trumped-up charges, and foreign journalists in Tokyo committing suicide under police interrogation, are all considered by the Japanese not to damage Japanese honor. It is no wonder that Westerners continue to regard this Japanese military arrogance as a strange thing, as they do not know what is admirable. (Reuters telegram, July 31)</p>
<p>Berlin - Yesterday, local newspapers published detailed reports on the discovery of a large-scale British espionage organization in Japan and the suicide of the Reuters correspondent in Tokyo in a prominent position. The newspapers said that Japan's discovery of the British conspiracy was not surprising, as Britain had espionage organizations in the capitals of various European countries. It is satisfying that the Japanese military authorities were able to arrest the spies before they escaped. (Haitong News Agency telegram, July 31)</p>
<p>Tokyo - According to a Japanese semi-official statement released today regarding the death of Cox, Cox was injured in eight places and died at 3:46 p.m. on Sunday due to excessive internal bleeding in front of his wife and British Consul General Crowley in Tokyo. This tragedy occurred after Cox finished lunch, which was prepared at home and brought by his wife. Beforehand, Cox had written a few words on the margin of his wife's letter and put it in his pocket. When Cox was walking around the room, he suddenly jumped out of the window, which was opened by the military police to let in cool air. The military police guarding Cox were unable to stop him from doing this, which was at 2:05 p.m. Cox sustained eight injuries to his jaw and legs. First aid was administered in the medical room of the Army Police Headquarters, and three renowned surgical experts were summoned to treat him. They did their best, but he eventually died due to his injuries. Commander Hirabayashi of the Tokyo Military Police Headquarters expressed his regret over Cox's tragic death and ordered two guards to be stationed by the body to show respect. At 7:30 p.m., the body was sent to the British Embassy and then to Selbo Hospital. Commander Hirabayashi and his staff presented wreaths to pay their respects. (Reuters telegram, July 31)</p>

<p>New York - Reuters Far East Manager Zhang Xuelou said yesterday upon arriving here that foreign journalists in the Far East are currently facing serious personal danger, especially in Shanghai. Although he did not clarify the nature of the danger, he was quite convinced of this statement. Speaking of the death of his colleague, Reuters correspondent in Tokyo Cox, who was detained by the Japanese military police two days ago, he said that he had doubts about the Japanese report that Cox's death was due to suicide. This kind of investigation of Cox will certainly not convince people. Cox did not engage in any work other than normal news reporting, and he never made any speeches or writings that would arouse the hatred of the Japanese authorities.

<h3>US Intensifies Preparations to Compete with Japan; Pravda Comments that the Contradictions Between the Two Countries are Sharpening</h3>
<p>Moscow - Regarding the US ban on the export of scrap iron and gasoline, Pravda commented, "Japan is the largest customer of US scrap iron and gasoline. US gasoline exports to Japan account for 70% of Japan's gasoline imports. As for scrap iron, all of it is imported from the US. The abolition of the US-Japan trade agreement shows that the US is increasing economic pressure on Japan. President Roosevelt's recent order has given the US greater power to suppress Japan. The US will never give up its markets and position in China, and US exporters are willing to trade with both China and Japan at the same time, supplying both countries with military raw materials and armaments. US imperialists believe that if Japan does not completely control China, they can profit from the Sino-Japanese war. Although there have been recent changes in Japan, after the change of the Japanese cabinet, it has created the saying of "clarifying US-Japan affairs" and at the same time clamoring for expansion in the South China Sea. This has shocked the United States and intensified preparations to fight Japan. In short, the current stage of US-Japan relations has proven that the contradictions between the two countries have become more acute due to their attempts to compete for hegemony in the Pacific.

<h3>US International Trade Council Holds Annual Meeting; Roosevelt Warns Those Who Advocate Abandoning Free Principles</h3>
<p>San Francisco - President Roosevelt, in a message to the 27th annual meeting of the International Trade Council here last night, issued a warning to those who advocate that the US abandon its trade policy with democratic countries based on free principles. The message also stated, "A strong economic defense program is a major part of our country's defense program." In the message, the President also paid tribute to Farnell, the Chairman of the Trade Council, and said, "The so-called idea that we can adopt the controlled trade methods of totalitarian countries to avoid totalitarian countries controlling our domestic economy is purely an ideal."

<h3>"Iron Lung Man" Celebrates Birthday; Walks Outside Iron Lung for the First Time in Four Years</h3>
<p>Chicago - Snyder, the "Iron Lung Man" who contracted the disease in Beijing in 1936 and has since relied on the iron lung to live his life for four years, recently celebrated his 30th birthday, walking around the third room of his summer residence. This is the first time since April 1, 1939, that he has left the iron lung to hold his birthday celebration. He wore a special respirator today, allowing him to walk and breathe easily.

<h3>Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria to Begin Negotiations; Based on Establishing Principles; Bulgaria and Hungary Achieve Their Wishes</h3>
<p>Bucharest - Negotiations between the Romanian government and Bulgaria and Hungary will begin in a few days. These negotiations will be based on the principles established in Germany and Italy a few days ago. The Romanian-Bulgarian issue is relatively simple. Romania's Southern Dobruja Province will be returned to Bulgaria. Border exchanges, residents, and the date of handover will be discussed after negotiations between the two countries. It is reported that there were 366,000 Bulgarians in Romania during the last census. The province is located on the Black Sea coast and is an agricultural area, partly grassland. In 1938, it had a population of 900,000, of which 300,000 to 400,000 will be ceded to Bulgaria. The Romanian-Hungarian negotiations are said to be held in Arad, from which the Romanian troops will soon withdraw. According to the Treaty of Trianon, Hungary ceded 102,282 square kilometers of territory to Romania in 1919, with a population of 5.8 million in 1938. The land is divided into three provinces: Western Burgenland with a population of 3.4 million, Banat with a population of 900,000, and Maramures with a population of 1.5 million. According to a 1930 statistic, the area had about 1.4 million Hungarians and 700,000 Germans. A few weeks ago, newspapers claimed that the resolution of the Romanian-Hungarian issue and the exchange of residents were also important. Bucharest intends to demarcate a strip of land 80 kilometers wide on the border, while Western Burgenland will remain within Romanian territory. The two provinces to be ceded have railways connecting the four important cities in the north and south. The method of exchanging residents is that Hungarians living in other parts of Romania will be exchanged for Romanians in the ceded territory. It is expected that the negotiations will not arouse resentment among Romanians, as both sides have expressed their intention to resolve it peacefully. (Haitong telegram, July 31)</p>
<p>Bucharest - The situation in the Balkan Peninsula seems to have passed the negotiation stage. A Reuters telegram from Italy to the Bucharest Daily News stated that the Axis powers are limited to issuing friendly advice and are carefully watching the Southeast to prevent outside forces intent on preventing the resolution of existing disputes from interfering. On Sunday, Bucharest confiscated the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, which is quite interesting. The newspaper contained an article stating that Romania should reach an understanding with Bulgaria. It is said that Bulgaria's claim to the Dobruja region extends as far as Mangalia and even Constanta. The Soviet Union supports Bulgaria's demand because Romania is taking a pro-German policy, while the Soviet Union wants to eliminate Italian and German forces in the Balkan Peninsula. The general Romanian newspapers welcomed and expressed satisfaction with the results of the Salzburg and Rome talks as briefly stated in the Romanian government communiqué and emphasized the importance of the role played by Romania in the reorganization of Southeastern Europe under the supervision of the Axis powers. A telegram from Berlin to the Romanian government newspaper stated that the German authorities considered it very important that British and French interests should be removed from Southeastern Europe and therefore welcomed the expulsion of French technicians and alleged conspirators from Romania, saying that this was clear evidence of the elimination of British and French interests.

<h3>Dismissal of Jewish Civil Servants</h3>
<p>Bucharest - Last night, it was officially announced that all Jewish employees of the Ministry of Interior have been dismissed. It is reported that all low-ranking Jewish employees of other departments will also be dismissed. (Haitong telegram, July 31)</p>
<h3>Deteriorating Relations Between Britain and Romania</h3>
<p>London - It was learned from official sources here last night that the British lodged a protest with Romania in Bucharest two days ago, mentioning the detention of British ships on the Danube, the expulsion of British technicians from Romanian oil companies, and the unwarranted interference in the administration of the British Astrea Romana company. The British dispatch pointed out that the Romanian government has taken arbitrary actions against British interests in the above-mentioned issues without fully discussing them with the British government. Unless the Romanian government gives the British satisfactory answers on these points, there is no hope for the restoration of normal relations between Britain and Romania. (Reuters telegram, July 31)</p>
<h3>South Slav Cabinet Likely to Be Reorganized</h3>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia - According to sources here, the main issue currently being discussed in the castle where Prince Regent Paul resides is the reorganization of the cabinet. The fact that the Prime Minister and several cabinet members are still in Brdo pri Kranju proves this. It is reported that Deputy Prime Minister Dr. Maček will also go. According to political sources, the current Foreign Minister, Dr. Marković, and the Minister of Education, Dr. Korošec, are both potential candidates for Prime Minister.

<h3>Hungarian Delegation to Moscow to Conduct Business Negotiations</h3>
<p>Budapest - A Hungarian economic delegation of fifteen people departed from here today, heading to Moscow via Berlin. The leader of the delegation is Nylky. It is reported that after their arrival in Moscow, they will conduct business negotiations, the main purpose of which is to try to purchase raw materials from the Soviet Union for the development of Hungarian industry. (Haitong telegram, July 31)</p>
<p>Budapest - The Hungarian Foreign Ministry's mouthpiece, "Lloyd's Newspaper," published an article yesterday refuting the claims by Britain and France that Hungary's draft autonomy for Carpathian Ruthenia is an effort by Hungary to adjust Soviet-Hungarian relations. The newspaper strongly stated that Hungary's relations with the Soviet Union are extremely friendly and there is no need to adjust them at all, and that the Soviet Union's policies towards the Axis countries and Hungary are extremely correct. The main purpose of Hungary's foreign policy is to seek coordination with the Axis countries. As the Soviet Union and Germany and Italy are cooperating closely, there is no need to adjust Hungary's relations with the Soviet Union at all. (Haitong telegram, July 31)</p>
<h3>Syria Situation Chaotic, Governor-General Recalled, French Officers Flocking to Join British</h3>
<p>London – Reuters special correspondent on the Palestine-Syria border reports that rumors of unrest in Syria are untrue; the region remains peaceful, but the situation is chaotic. Many French officers have crossed the border to join the British forces, but most are still on duty. Soldiers recruited from Egypt and elsewhere have been dismissed. The precarious financial situation in France is severely affecting Syria. The franc is falling, shaking the entire economy and leading to potential inflation. Strict censorship of postal and telegraphic news is also causing suspicion between Syrians and French soldiers. Syrian Governor-General General Mittelhauser has not crossed into Palestine to join the British, but has been recalled by the Vichy government. With Mr. Mittelhauser gone, his deputy resigned and flew to Egypt to join the British forces. French soldiers are now receiving news from home that their families are suffering hardship under German control, which is increasing their resentment and dissatisfaction with the Pétain government.

<h3>German-Turkish Relations</h3>
<p>Istanbul – After Turkish Prime Minister Saydam's speech on July 12, frankly rejecting foreign interference, and the subsequent departure of German Ambassador to Turkey, Von Papen, for Berlin, German efforts to win over Turkey are proceeding along a new path. German agents here are no longer threatening the political world, but are instead focusing on gaining the trust of Turkish merchants. They argue that Turkey's true interests lie in developing trade with Germany, using the recently signed Turkish-German trade agreement as justification. Circulars discussing this argument have recently been issued, and some Turkish newspapers are concerned that this development may lead to German control of Turkish trade. (Reuters, 31st)</p>

<h3>German Forces Hesitate to Attack England, War Situation Gradually Favorable to England, Naval and Air Superiority are Decisive Factors, Large Army Massed on the Islands, Defenses Strong</h3>
<p>London – A military correspondent for the "Yorkshire Post" today summarized the factors currently favoring the British side in the war as follows: (1) The German forces failed to follow up the evacuation of British forces in France in June and attack England, thus missing an opportunity. (2) Britain now has a large army massed domestically and its defenses are strong. (3) The British Air Force has created a spiritual advantage. (4) The British blockade is now gradually closing the last supply routes. (5) The enemy has failed to prevent supplies from the British Empire and the Americas. (6) Britain now has more food and raw materials than before, and the sea is cleared by the British fleet. (7) German forces are distributed along the coastline from the Arctic Ocean to the Pyrenees. (8) The German coastline does not have sufficient ships to protect it and prevent invasion. (9) Italy's position increases Germany's burden, as Germany would have to provide material assistance if Britain attacked Italy. (10) Britain controls the Mediterranean, preventing Italy from communicating with its colonies. (11) Britain is confident of repelling air attacks, and the number of British fighters is increasing daily. (12) Britain has established an offensive advantage with its bomber force. (13) The country is resolute and united, while Hitler has concerns about his occupied territories and the Balkans. (14) The Soviet Union is now hindering Germany's freedom of action. (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<p>New York – The "New York Times" today wrote that when France fell, everyone thought the blitzkrieg would soon be unleashed on Britain. Unexpectedly, the British showed amazing calm and courage, thinking through everything they saw across the Channel and preparing to deal with an attack on their island. If German forces were to land in Britain tomorrow, no village would be shocked or panicked. However, it is highly possible that Hitler will never dare to risk his expeditionary force to a certain degree of destruction. The warlord who dictated the French armistice terms in the same place where Germany surrendered in 1918 may have the same sense of humor and revenge, intending to conquer Britain through starvation. If he thinks this way and tries to impose a blockade before attacking, it would be good news for the British, as this is the type of war they would choose first, and can use all their strongest weapons to the extreme. (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<h3>Germany May Use Airplanes to Release Liquid Gas, British Government Warns Public to Take Precautions</h3>
<p>London – It was announced here last night that Britain will double the blockade of German imports and exports. The announcement stated that all imports and exports must obtain a "Naval Ministry Permit." Germany's occupation of the French coastline has greatly changed the economic war. "We should not only control all shipping in the Mediterranean and the North Sea, but also that passing through the Atlantic," British authorities expressed confidence that the tightening of the blockade will reduce the patrolling responsibilities of the British Navy, as the number of ships passing through the Atlantic may decrease. The Atlantic islands included in the tightening of the blockade are reportedly Cape Verde, the Azores, and the Canary Islands. The British government has notified Washington and Latin American countries of Britain's determination to tighten control over contraband trade. (United Press, 31st)</p>
<h3>British Government Announces Intensified Economic Blockade Against Germany, Atlantic Shipping Will Be Under Strict Naval Control, and Plans to Completely Stop Oil Shipments to Spain, Germany May Use Airplanes to Release Liquid Gas, British Government Warns Public to Take Precautions</h3>
<p>London – Minister of Economic Warfare Dalton stated in the House of Commons yesterday that although Germany has occupied most of Western Europe, its required overseas imports are still blocked in the sea controlled by the British Navy. Some quarters have suggested that Britain is imposing the blockade on some neutral countries, but this is not the case. In addition to issuing naval certificates, the British government still adheres to the policy of not only allowing sufficient supplies to meet the needs of various countries to pass through British naval jurisdiction, but also assisting neutral countries in obtaining supplies. Shipping Minister Cross replied to a Member of Parliament's question, saying that the progress of the war makes new plans for controlling shipping necessary. The number of ships under British control is very large, including neutral ships chartered by Britain. The government is still prepared to charter more ships, but also intends to adopt other methods to ensure that ships not under British control cannot engage in trade beneficial to the enemy. The conveniences enjoyed by ships under British control have always applied to all ships, but from now on, shipowners who have provided sufficient remuneration to Britain or who assure the government that their business does not harm Britain's war effort will be able to obtain a pass and continue to enjoy this convenience; otherwise, they will not. Those who do not carry this pass will be subject to individual investigation and will face delays and inconvenience. (Reuters, 31st)</p>

<h3>Canada Large-Scale Production of Military Supplies, Can Manufacture 100 Airplanes Per Month, Unmarried Men Forced to Undergo Military Training</h3>
<p>Ottawa – Minister of Munitions and Supply Howe stated in the House of Commons the situation of Canada's industrial mobilization, stating that almost all sectors of the world have large-scale production of "automatic equipment" as Canada currently does. Currently, about 600 pairs are produced daily, and this number will definitely increase greatly in January and February. Canadian aircraft factories built 25 aircraft last week, and in the early part of next year monthly aircraft production can reach 360 aircraft. The production of various guns and ammunition and explosives is also increasing. The Minister of National Defence also stated in the House of Commons that all unmarried men in Canada who pass inspection, from the age of 21 to 45, will be forced to undergo 30 days of military training within one year. There is no reason why Canada should not adopt this system, training a million-strong army on the one hand, and still engage in industrial production on the other, to meet the army's needs. In the first year, only unmarried men aged 21 to 35 will be called up, which will roughly meet the needs of the national defense sector. It is estimated that there are a total of 2.5 million Canadian men between the ages of 18 and 44, of whom 1.198 million are unmarried. (Reuters, 31st)</p>

On the 29th, a British convoy was spotted, including several battleships, one aircraft carrier, multiple destroyers, and several transport ships. Italian aircraft immediately intercepted and bombed, and the enemy ships opened fire. The ships quickly scattered, and the fighters on the aircraft carrier took off to intercept the Italian aircraft, but the Italian aircraft had already gained a favorable position and dropped several heavy bombs. One enemy ship caught fire, and one enemy aircraft was shot down. Two battleships and one aircraft carrier were also hit at the same time. (Haitong Agency, 31st)</p>
<h3>British and Germans Publish Air Force Battle Situation, Due to Poor Weather the Previous Day, Both Sides Had Little Activity</h3>
<p>Berlin – This afternoon's German military report stated that due to poor weather, the German Air Force was unable to be very active. In addition to reconnaissance flights over the coasts of eastern and southern England, German aircraft bombed the aircraft factory in Fairleigh, and the port facilities in Goole and Plymouth. Several British aircraft flew into western Germany last night. Although they dropped bombs, there were no German losses. (Haitong Agency, 31st)</p>
<p>London – An Air Ministry communiqué stated that although enemy aircraft activity was reduced yesterday (Tuesday), two enemy bombers and one fighter were shot down. On Sunday, British bombers attacked vast areas of Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium, damaging a large supply ship near Flushing, as well as ships in Emden and Hamburg. Oil refineries in the Ruhr and several airfields in Germany and the Netherlands were also bombed. One British bomber was lost. On Sunday night, visibility was poor, and a large group of British bombers penetrated deep into enemy territory, but 24 of them did not find their designated targets and returned without dropping their bombs. The remaining aircraft attacked targets such as oil refineries, shipyards, airfields, and transportation targets in the Ruhr region of northwestern Germany, and in the Netherlands and Belgium. On Sunday, there were encounters around the British coast, and a total of 21 enemy aircraft were destroyed, and two British fighters went missing. (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<p>Berlin – Yesterday's German military report stated, "Yesterday, the German Air Force attacked the port of Dover, using several waves of Junkers dive bombers to bomb the facilities in the port. The damage it suffered will make it ineffective for a long time. Although the British side put up fierce resistance with anti-aircraft guns and a large number of fighters, the bombs dropped by the German aircraft hit their targets. Four ships in the port, totaling 32,000 tons, were also hit. One German aircraft collided with a British aircraft, but still returned to its base after dropping its bombs, and no one was injured. This time, the British lost 15 Spitfires and Hurricanes, while the German side lost only three aircraft. The numbers published by the British government are only intended to cover up their failure. However, the British side admits that the German attack on Dover completely bombed military objectives." (Haitong Agency, 31st)</p>

<h3>Tagore Encourages Compatriots Not to Be Used by Others</h3>
<p>London – General de Gaulle, head of the French National Committee in London, stated last night during a French broadcast on the British Broadcasting Corporation that the first result of the Pétain government's acceptance of armistice terms was dissatisfaction among the natives of the French Empire, which may lead to rebellion. Their loyalty and trust in France was shaken by the French Empire's surrender without a fight, and they all felt angry. General de Gaulle concluded that those who were compromising in Vichy were obviously despicable tools voluntarily used by the enemy, so he declared in the name of France that the French Empire must not obey their evil orders.

<h3>Random Snippets of Roosevelt's Busy Life</h3>
<p>For the past seven years, U.S. President Roosevelt has shouldered the world's most significant responsibilities, yet he manages to exude competence and joy, possessing a hearty appetite and sleeping like a baby. His most remarkable trait is a profound interest in life, enabling him to find "endless joy" in his demanding duties. Had it been someone else, they might have long since "retreated." Recently, both domestic and foreign troubles have pressed in, leaving President Roosevelt with even fewer opportunities for rest as he dedicates himself day and night to public service. He has spent years in the White House, navigating numerous urgent and difficult situations with unwavering commitment. During the Wabash River flood, his study remained illuminated until two in the morning; maps and reports were strewn across his desk, surrounded by secretaries and military personnel, as he issued instructions to western governors via long-distance telephone. After the outbreak of war in Europe, Secretary of State Hull and Under Secretary Welles often remained in his bedroom until dawn. Roosevelt possesses the spirit of a firefighter, responding instantly to any alarm. Only around mid-September last year, when the European war had just erupted, did the president, usually so cheerful and energetic, suddenly fall ill, suffering from a severe liver ailment. As soon as Congress passed his Neutrality Act, he rushed to Warm Springs to rest and restore his weary nerves. Now, Roosevelt has gained extraordinary confidence, admired by his supporters and feared by his detractors.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt's workday begins between 8:30 and 9:00 AM, starting with a leisurely breakfast in bed. Secretaries, trusted advisors, and occasionally a cabinet member are already in attendance. After breakfast, he dresses and is wheeled in his wheelchair to his desk in the office. Meetings with cabinet members and visitors take place from 10:00 or 10:30 AM until 5:00 or 5:30 PM. He eats a light lunch during this time, often discussing important matters with senior officials at the table. Sometimes, he invites the last visitor he met to join him for a swim in the pool, which he had built after moving into the White House. Usually, swimming is followed by a massage. If there are other engagements in the evening, he confers on national affairs in his study. Otherwise, he reads casually or enjoys his stamp collection. If there is a formal banquet, he retreats to his private room alone after greeting the last arriving guest, leaving his wife to entertain the assembled guests.</p>
<p>His personal physician, Dr. McIntire, pays close attention to the President's health, but Roosevelt is very self-disciplined. He has a good appetite, yet his weight consistently remains between 182 and 187 pounds, fluctuating by no more than five pounds. He enjoys game and fish, especially turtle, although it is not easily digested. Sometimes, he drinks a "cocktail" before dinner. Informal meals are often held in his study. He often asks his guests, "What would you like to drink?" If "cocktails" have already been served, no further alcohol is consumed after the meal. Dr. McIntire insists that the President take a trip after a period of intense work to change the environment. During his rest and travel, Roosevelt usually manages to completely disconnect, savoring the pleasure of secluded leisure, except for half an hour spent listening to official reports from the White House. As a seasoned naval expert, he often takes the opportunity during his travels to engage in command during exercises. Upon returning from his travels, the first thing he does is meet with reporters, flashing a tanned smile, a cigarette in hand, full of energy and exuding charm. Clearly, he finds great enjoyment in his role as president. He wields great power, which is both stimulating and mysterious, and he possesses a childlike innocence and delight.</p>
<p>He has the talent of a stage performer, never approaching the podium like an ordinary person, but rather like a star entering the stage, appearing suddenly from above at the peak of the audience's excitement. When he speaks, he builds tension when tension is needed, pauses when pauses are needed, and he perfectly captures the moment when the audience responds with applause. The ideas, phrases, punchlines, and even the prepared speeches themselves are all carefully scrutinized by his top advisors, so any final statement has been reviewed by four or five people in addition to his own considerations. Even in these difficult times, his sense of humor, including irony and jokes, has not diminished. He also dislikes being bound by convention, often receiving foreign guests in casual attire, replacing stale clichés with witty and insightful remarks.</p>
<p>Mrs. Roosevelt, Eleanor, is a first-rate mother and wife, irreplaceable. Mrs. Roosevelt's reputation and status almost rival her husband's. If the First Lady were less active, life in the White House for Roosevelt might be quieter, but it would also likely lack in compassion, empathy, and generosity. His staff sometimes protests about the "disruptive" guests who come "through the back door," but they thank Mrs. Roosevelt, as it is her benevolent policy. Mrs. Roosevelt's friends often bring "grassroots" news to broaden the President's horizons. As a couple, they are truly the Meng and Liang of our time. Naturally, both of them are incredibly busy in the White House, so it is common for Mrs. Roosevelt to have a casual conversation with her husband in the evening study or after the President has finished his official duties. Regarding family matters, he expressed great regret over the recent divorce of his eldest son, James.</p>
<p>In the small organization that works with him in the White House, one person who deserves special mention is Miss Marguerite LeHand, who has been his secretary for twenty years. Tall and beautiful, impeccably dressed, quiet, and virtuous, she is truly a model of efficiency. All the President's personal correspondence and affairs are entrusted to her. This "Missy" has her own living room, bedroom, and bathroom in the White House. Urgent phone calls from across the Atlantic at night from Ambassador Bullitt in France or Ambassador Kennedy in England first have to go through "Missy," and if she says "go ahead," the phone next to the President's bed will ring loudly. President Roosevelt treats his friends with great kindness. In addition to his family, friends, and colleagues, he welcomes a wide range of people, embodying the American spirit. From the nobility to the commoner, if he has the opportunity to meet them, he always finds a way to handle it well.</p>
<p>Patience and charm are Roosevelt's weapons when dealing with people. Often, people arrive disgruntled but leave satisfied. And some, after seeing him, can't help but say, "Isn't he charming?" as if they have discovered something rare. In this eventful year of 1940, the "man" sitting in the White House remains calm. He takes a casual view of economic concerns that many previous presidents considered daunting. He has lived comfortably on his private income since he was born. He is neither extravagant nor stingy in the White House. Some people who pay attention to these kinds of things say that his annual travel and entertainment expenses are only $25,000, which could not possibly cover the costs. Inviting royalty costs a lot of money. Even if you combine his private income and salary, it is still not enough, but he has plenty of savings to draw on, so he doesn't worry. He is very self-aware. If he were to retire and become an ordinary citizen, he could make a living as an editor or writer. Besides, his wife's ability to earn money is already unique.</p>
<p>People close to President Roosevelt say that he has two theories about life. One is that he is optimistic and fearless, and he does everything he can to make things that benefit humanity succeed. When he takes on a task, he always finds a way to solve it. Because he is straightforward and somewhat impatient, he immediately wants to find a solution to any problem he encounters. He is dedicated to saving the world and calling for peace, shouting himself hoarse and doing everything he can... He only seeks peace of mind and asks nothing more. He has complete faith in his own judgment. The other theory is more complex. Deep down, he is scarred and may well be a sad person. Nevertheless, he bravely takes heart, embraces joy, embodies Heaven's virtue of cherishing life, and performs all kinds of "good deeds." President Roosevelt is at the pinnacle of human achievement, yet he is humble and open-minded. His greatness comes from this. Using any single theory to explain such an outstanding person is too simplistic and insufficient. Ultimately, whether all his measures are beneficial or detrimental to the country will be determined by history.</p>
<h3>Report from the Sichuan Education Commissioner: Progress in Preparing for National Education (Part 2) – Teacher Training Plans</h3>
<p>The number of teachers needed for the implementation of national education in the province has increased dramatically compared to before. If the existing teachers in each county continue to operate the existing schools, then with each year's increase in primary school classes, calculating 1.5 teachers per class, we will still need to add 30,000 teachers. For the teachers needed this year, apart from this year's normal school graduates and graduates from other secondary schools who can serve as teachers, and the deployment of service corps members, there is still a shortage of 17,000 to 20,000 teachers. To address the shortage of teachers, it has been stipulated that each county will hold teacher training classes, recruiting private school teachers or students who have attended junior high school and other intellectuals to join the classes for training. The training period is two months during the summer vacation and one month during the winter vacation. After the two-month training period during the summer vacation, they will be assigned to serve as teachers in various national schools, and then recalled for training during the winter vacation. The training subjects include spiritual training, an overview of national education, administration of central schools and national schools, an outline of local autonomy, teaching methods for national language textbooks, teaching methods for general knowledge textbooks, teaching methods for arithmetic textbooks, teaching methods for music, physical education, and scout textbooks, teaching methods for crafts and art textbooks, implementation methods for civic education, general teaching techniques, practice, physical education, music, and military training. The required funds are all allocated by the province, and the teaching materials for each subject are also compiled and distributed by the Department of Education for application. These training classes have already been launched separately. As for the teachers needed by August next year, measures for one-year teacher training classes have been stipulated, ordering them to be handled by each commissioner's office. The admission qualifications are junior high school graduation and equivalent education or having served as a primary school teacher for more than three years. The study period is set at one year, and the study subjects are handled according to the simplified normal school curriculum issued by the Ministry. Graduates will be used for the newly established national schools next year. To adapt to the needs of the facts, the commissioners of each district and the governments of each county are planning to merge the teacher training classes with the village chief training classes, and they are planning to change the study period of the one-year teacher training classes to half a year, and they are submitting separate applications for approval.</p>
<p>Preparation for National Education in Each District and County</p>
<p>Since the province decided to implement national education, the commissioners of each district and the county chiefs of each county have started preparing for the implementation of national education. After the promulgation of the implementation measures, each district and county made further plans. As of the end of June, each district and county has made the following preparations for the implementation of national education: (1) Planning for the establishment of schools. Each district and county has made detailed plans for the establishment of schools in stages. According to the reports of each district and county, it will not be difficult to complete the universal establishment of national schools in three years, and the 1st District, 3rd District, 7th District, 10th District, and 11th District are planning to complete the establishment of national schools universally within one year. (2) Fundraising. Each district and county has made preparations for fundraising. The 1st District, 3rd District, 7th District, 10th District, and 11th District are planning to build houses and schools and raise enough funds for national schools to lay a permanent foundation for the nation. (3) Improving teacher salaries. Each district and county, in view of the fact that the current salaries of general teachers are too low to maintain their livelihood, want to ensure that the original teachers can work with peace of mind, and those who are preparing to serve as teachers are happy to teach, it is necessary to improve teacher salaries. Therefore, they are working hard to improve teacher salaries in accordance with the provincial measures. At present, the salaries of general teachers in each county have been raised to more than 30 yuan, and the 1st District, 3rd District, 7th District, 10th District, and 11th District have provisions for providing meals and subsidies for rice for the sake of giving preferential treatment to teachers. This system should be vigorously promoted so that it can be popularized throughout the province. (4) Adjusting administrative organizations. Each county has uniformly established an education section, and the personnel of the education section have been adjusted. The number of school inspectors in each county has also been increased as appropriate to meet the needs of promoting national education. Since each district and county has made such preparations for promoting national education, it will be more convenient when it is actually implemented.</p>
<p>Organization of the National Education Committee</p>
<p>At present, the province is promoting compulsory education and mass education, and has separately organized a compulsory education committee and a mass education committee to be responsible for planning, promoting, and evaluating. To implement the new national education system, compulsory education and mass education have been merged, and there is no need to establish the compulsory education committee and the mass education committee separately. Therefore, the compulsory education committee and the mass education committee have been merged and reorganized into a national education committee. The interim regulations for the organization of the Sichuan Provincial National Education Committee have been drafted and submitted to the 401st committee meeting of the provincial government for approval. The National Education Committee is chaired by the Director of the Department of Education and has 15 to 20 members. The candidates for the committee members are as follows: (1) Two members of the Sichuan Provincial Party Department; (2) Two senators of the Sichuan Provincial Provisional Senate; (3) The Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, the Chief Secretary, and the Head of the Third Section; (4) The Chief Secretary of the Department of Education and the Heads of the First, Second, and Third Sections, and the Director of the School Inspectorate; (5) Five to eleven education experts or people enthusiastic about education. Under the Director of the Committee, there are five standing committee members, one secretary, one chief officer, and seven to nine officers, who are responsible for various committee affairs. The preparations for national education in the province have been briefly described above. In the future, how to plan the national education undertaking and make the methods more perfect, and how to supervise and guide to improve the efficiency, we sincerely hope that the members of the National Education Committee and the education personnel of the whole province will give assistance and guidance at any time. We are fortunate, we are fortunate! (End)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Commends the Education Authorities of Guangxi Province</h3>
<p>(Guilin, 30th) The Ministry of Education telegraphed the provincial government, stating that according to the reports of inspectors Jiang Qi and others, although the educational funds in Guangxi Province are insufficient and the salaries of educational personnel at all levels are meager, the work is active and the spirit is high. The Director of the Department, Lei Peihong, has excellent scholarship and good leadership, which is commendable.

<h3>Ministry of Education Establishes Guizhou College of Agriculture and Engineering</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Aviation News) The Ministry of Education believes that agriculture and industry in Guizhou urgently need to be developed. However, Guizhou is located in a remote area, and there is still a lack of higher agricultural and industrial academic institutions. This not only affects the War of Resistance, but also poses difficulties for Guizhou high school students in terms of further education. When Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education inspected the southwest and passed through Guiyang, he expressed his intention to establish a college of agriculture and engineering in Guizhou to meet the current needs. After returning to Chongqing, he immediately started planning. It has now been drafted and submitted to the Central Government to set up the National Guizhou College of Agriculture and Engineering. It has been formally approved by the 469th meeting of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, the Ministry of Education specially requested that the private Xiangya College be changed to a national one, which was also approved by the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>Recent Developments at the College of Arts and Sciences of the University of Nanking</h3>
<p>(Chengdu Correspondence) Since the College of Arts and Sciences of the University of Nanking moved to Chengdu, although it has not been able to develop to the fullest extent due to the limited school site, it has continued to work hard. The main points are to maintain academic studies, add necessary subjects, and intensify research. Research is intended to enhance teaching interest and increase teaching effectiveness. The content includes: (1) Compilation of historical materials of the Sino-Japanese War since 1937; (2) Exploration of border issues; (3) Analysis of county administration issues; (4) Experimentation of woolen fabrics; (5) Investigation and improvement of Sichuan handicrafts; (6) Compilation of a catalog of educational slides, etc. Each department of Chinese and English also has a central goal and is engaged in research and writing, which is very helpful for reference. In view of the lack of libraries and vocational schools in China, and the fact that libraries in various places are not well managed and inefficient due to the lack of specialized personnel, the College of Arts and Sciences of the University of Nanking plans to establish a library training program, the purpose of which is to train library professionals and assist in the improvement of library undertakings in various places. It is reported that it has been formally approved by the Ministry of Education before the summer vacation this year and will recruit new students in the summer vacation together with the newly established Department of Philosophy and Psychology.</p>

<h3>A Hurricane Suddenly Advances Rapidly: Shanghai Swept Last Night; Tides Stirred by the Wind; Streets Flooded</h3>
<p>This hurricane progressed very rapidly. At 10:00 AM yesterday, the Jianghai Customs received a report from the observatory that the hurricane had reached 27.30 degrees north latitude and 125 degrees east longitude, with the eye of the storm at 60 nautical miles, advancing rapidly northwest, and likely to strike Shanghai. The Customs then, at 10:50 AM yesterday, hoisted one black ball on the flagpole atop the clock tower to predict the hurricane's arrival and warn ships in the Huangpu River to take precautions. At 4:25 PM, the Customs received another report from the observatory that the hurricane was nearing Shanghai, located at 28.30 degrees north latitude and 124 degrees east longitude, the eye of the storm remained at 60 nautical miles, and still rapidly advancing northwest, having reached the Tongsha sea area outside the Wusongkou. The Customs immediately added another black ball. Therefore, since mid-afternoon yesterday, two black balls were hoisted high on the flagpole of the Customs clock tower. At night, this was changed to two red lanterns.</p>
<p>Signal Identification</p>
<p>It is heard that if the wind force does not subside this morning, the signal will follow the Port Authority Notice No. 7 by Mr. Tebeck of the Customs on the 24th of this month, and starting today (August 1st), a black cross will be hoisted, with subsequent signals remaining one black ball, and one red lantern at night, or two red lanterns in emergencies. Since the Customs hoisted two black balls yesterday, the situation on the Huangpu River immediately became tense. All incoming ships increased their speed to dock as early as possible, and departing ships ceased raising anchors.</p>
<p>Ships Sheltering from the Wind</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Tai Koo Company's Qingyuan wheel bound for Hong Kong and Haiphong, left port at 10:00 AM, but after receiving the hurricane report, anchored at Wusongkou to shelter from the wind. The Chongqing wheel, which left port at 11:00 AM yesterday morning bound for Qinhuangdao, also anchored at Wusongkou. The Haikou wheel, originally scheduled to raise anchor yesterday afternoon bound for Hong Kong, ceased its departure to avoid the wind. Jardine Matheson's Guisheng wheel, scheduled to go to Hong Kong and Haiphong yesterday, and the Yongsheng wheel, also scheduled to go to Tianjin yesterday, both ceased their voyages and will depart after the hurricane passes. In addition, the Greek wheel Hellenie Trader, which arrived the day before yesterday from Saigon with a large amount of foreign rice, totaling more than 24,700 bags, and was originally scheduled to depart for Qingdao after unloading yesterday, also ceased its departure due to the hurricane.</p>
<p>Passing Shanghai This Morning</p>
<p>As for Jardine Matheson's Yusheng wheel, which came to Shanghai from Haiphong via Hong Kong, it is heard that Mr. Chaplim, the Director of the Municipal Postal Administration, also returned to Shanghai on that wheel. It was originally scheduled to arrive in port today, but due to the sudden hurricane, the arrival of that wheel is likely to be delayed. According to the Datong News Agency reporter, the hurricane center will generally pass Shanghai this morning, and if it does not make landfall, it will move towards the Yellow Sea. Although the Huangpu River was only slightly flooded yesterday, the tides had been stirred by wind and rain, and water had accumulated on all roads.</p>

<h3>Strike at the Water and Electricity Company: Still in Stalemate; Labor Awaits Mediation from the Municipal Council</h3>
<p>The labor strike at the British-owned Water and Electricity Company, since Mr. Yu Qiaqing once met with Mr. Caradoli, the chairman of the company, has been stuck because the company's proposed return-to-work conditions for employees were deemed unacceptable by the labor side, and the attitudes of both sides remain very firm, making it impossible to reach an agreement. According to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, the company's staff side convened representatives of the new and old factory workers yesterday to discuss countermeasures. As a result of the discussion, they decided to wait for mediation from the Municipal Council. It is heard that the workers at the new factory will settle their July salaries with the company today.</p>
<h3>No Progress on "Special Police" in West Shanghai; The Bureau Will Not Take Action Until the Police Commissioner Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News stated that an official from the Municipal Council stated yesterday (30th) that regarding the joint management of the police affairs of the extraterritorial roads by the Municipal Council and the authorities outside the Settlement, no concrete action will be taken by the Bureau until Major Bowan, the Police Commissioner of the Municipal Council, returns to Shanghai from his vacation in Weihaiwei. It is expected that Major Bowan will not return to Shanghai until the end of August. It is noted that Fu Xiaoan has already responded to the proposal made by the Municipal Council regarding the issue of extraterritorial roads. It is heard that Mr. Philippe, the Secretary-General and Director-General of the Municipal Council, is currently studying Fu's reply, which is written in Chinese and totals thirty pages. After recently receiving the land bureau files handed over by the Municipal Council, Fu has expressed his willingness to resolve the police affairs cases of the extraterritorial roads with the Municipal Council as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Japanese Inspection of Mail in the French Concession Has Become a Reality; Seven Japanese Inspectors Begin Work</h3>
<p>Under the urgent circumstances, the Japanese inspection of mail at the Rue Massenet postal branch has already begun with the Japanese personnel moving into the postal bureau the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning at eight o'clock, three Japanese inspectors continued to work at the bureau. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Head Office Order</p>
<p>According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the Shanghai Postal Administration has secretly ordered the Rue Massenet post office to handle the inspection of mail at that bureau in accordance with the regulations for inspecting the Postal Administration mail of the 27th year. The Rue Massenet branch has prepared an inspection log, and after the inspectors inspect and impound the mail, they will sign in the logbook, so that the bureau will not be held responsible.</p>
<p>Beginning to Read</p>
<p>After the seven Japanese inspectors gathered at the post office at 8:00 AM the day before yesterday and completed the formality of moving in, at 8:00 AM yesterday morning, three of the seven inspectors continued to be stationed in the messenger room to read letters. Each of these inspectors wore a circular metal badge on their chest and were proficient in Chinese, English, and Japanese. According to one of them, they have been responsible for inspecting mail at post offices in the Northeast.</p>
<p>Cancellation of Delivery</p>
<p>Also, according to a reporter from Datong News Agency who consulted with Mr. Wang Weisheng, Assistant of the Shanghai Postal Administration, the bureau is studying the possibility of having the mail collected and sent by the Rue Massenet post office delivered by the Administration. In this case, the mail delivered to the area under the jurisdiction of that bureau will be delayed by half a day. It is necessary to consider whether this can be understood by the senders or receivers.</p>
<p>Acting Alone</p>
<p>Mr. Wang finally said that he could guarantee that the inspection of the mail at the Rue Massenet post office had not yet begun, and that the implementation of this matter was already imminent. However, Mr. Wang then said that the Postal Administration would not notify the Rue Massenet post office when the inspection of mail at that bureau began, because the inspection of mail was a separate action by the Japanese and was not within the scope of postal services.</p>
<p>Office Space</p>
<p>The Rue Massenet post office has prepared a location for the inspectors behind the packaging bags, planning to enclose two rooms, and the craftsmen have already measured the area, but the fence has not yet been built. Before that room is completed, the Japanese inspectors are obviously using the messenger room as a temporary office. Judging from the situation in the past two days, various letters have begun to be affected, but there have been no cases of detention yet. It is also learned that Mr. Chaplim, the Shanghai Postmaster, is coming to Shanghai from Hong Kong on the Yusheng wheel and is expected to arrive tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Director Has Not Resigned</p>
<p>Also, according to Mr. Wang Weisheng, Deputy Postmaster of the Postal Administration, the news that Postmaster Chaplim will resign is a rumor. Mr. Chaplim is currently in charge of a Maritime Administration post office and will definitely not resign in the near future.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing Prefecture Relief Fair to Open This Afternoon; Invited Yu Qiaqing and Others to Unveil; Huang Yuqi Talks About Fundraising</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Huang Yuzhai, Director of General Affairs of the Shaoxing Prefecture Relief Fundraising Committee, told a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency that the food shortage in the seven counties of Shaoxing Prefecture has lasted for months and has not yet been resolved. It still relies on the generous donations of fellow villagers in Shanghai. The committee's progress with the assistance of various industries in Shanghai is still quite smooth. The donations from the silver and money industries in the city are very enthusiastic, and the coal industry has promised to help. The fundraising methods are divided into red and white forms. Anyone who pledges to donate will post the name of their business on red paper, and those who do not intend to donate will post it on white paper, and then these red and white papers will be posted in the market of each industry, so that people in the same industry can compare with each other. This method is very good. At the same time, it can also be seen their enthusiasm for raising funds for disaster relief. In order to further raise funds, the committee has agreed with all the famous dramatists in Shanghai to perform for fundraising starting today. It is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will provide more assistance.</p>
<p>Entertainment to Help Relief</p>
<p>In order to expand fundraising for Shaoxing Prefecture relief, the committee will hold a theatrical performance from today to the 4th at the Carlton Theatre on 21 Park Road to raise funds for disaster relief. All proceeds from ticket sales will be used for Shaoxing Prefecture relief expenses. Tickets are priced at two yuan, five yuan, and ten yuan. Yu Qiaqing, Wen Lanting, and Lin Kanghou have been invited to host the opening ceremony. Yuan Ludeng, Pei Yunqing, Huang Yuzhai, and others have been appointed as the presidium. It is stipulated that the next two days will be a Yue Opera gala, and the following two days will be Peking Opera to help disaster relief. The program will be extremely exciting.</p>
<p>Ningbo Prefecture Relief</p>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association held its third fundraising conference at Yu Qiaqing's residence at 4:00 PM yesterday. More than 300 enthusiastic fellow villagers from Shanghai attended. Wang Boyuan reported the total amount of donations, of which more than 700,000 yuan was raised by organizations and more than 500,000 yuan was raised by individuals. 60,000-70,000 yuan has not yet been paid, so the total amount received is more than 1,315,900 yuan. The meeting was adjourned after refreshments. In addition, the association has transported 60,000 bags of rice to Ningbo, which is 75,000 shi. The local relief rice is divided into 30 yuan, 40 yuan, and 50 yuan, which is for the extremely poor, the next poorest, and rice for relief.</p>
<h3>Zhenhai Shelling Yesterday Morning; Japanese Ships Shelled to Cover Landing but Were Repelled; Zhenhai Red Cross in Shanghai Raises Emergency Relief</h3>
<p>Japanese ships outside Zhenhaikou have been acting recklessly recently. According to a telegram received yesterday from the shipping industry in the city, at 8:00 AM on the 31st, Japanese ships shelled the Zhenhai fortress area. The Chinese coastal defense artillery immediately returned fire, and the shelling was very fierce for a time. Then, several Japanese motorboats approached the shore, attempting to land again. After fierce shooting by the Chinese army, the Japanese ships retreated in a panic.</p>
<p>Zhenhai Report</p>

<h3>American News Broadcaster Receives Threatening Phone Call; Ordered to Stop Broadcasting in Three Days; The Matter Has Been Reported to the US Consulate Authorities</h3>
<p>The Continental News stated that Mr. Alcott, a well-known American radio news broadcaster in the city, received a threat yesterday (30th) that he must stop broadcasting in three days. It started when Mr. Alcott was broadcasting on XMHA radio at 11:20 PM on the 29th, when someone suddenly called the radio station and made the above threat. After the reporter answered the phone, he told Mr. Alcott. The caller refused to disclose his name, but it was heard that he was a foreigner. The reporter asked him why he did not tell Mr. Alcott himself. The caller said that he might do so. At 1:30 PM yesterday afternoon, Mr. Alcott received a phone call at his residence. The caller was obviously the person who made the threatening phone call yesterday, and ordered Mr. Alcott to stop broadcasting in three days. Mr. Alcott has reported the matter to the US Consulate authorities and the Police Department.

<h3>Foreign Wheat Arrives in a Surge, Flour is Plentiful; Stop Selling at Fair Prices</h3>
<p>The noodle industry in the city previously requested the Municipal Council to ask the Fuxin and Fufeng flour mills to supply fair-priced flour again due to the shortage of flour on the market and the difficulty in purchasing it. Now that a large amount of foreign wheat has arrived, hoarders have emerged one after another, and sales are sluggish. The shortage of flour on the market has become a thing of the past. Therefore, the factory prices are more expensive than the market price. For this reason, the noodle shops voluntarily requested to stop, so the flour mills stopped selling at fair prices from the 29th. In total, 3,498 bags were sold at fair prices in 22 days. The Noodle Industry Association announced that the fair price sale has ended. In order to facilitate the industry and purchase fair-priced flour when there is a shortage in the future, they specially notified all members yesterday to apply for registration so that they can be supplied in the same way during the fair price sale.</p>

<h3>Greek Merchant Ship Arrives with Tribute Rice; Police Escort Protection into the Warehouse; A Total of 25,000 Bags, Said to Be Purchased by Chinese; Japanese Merchants Lease Ships to Carry, Japanese Side Arrives to Record</h3>
<p>The English Great America Evening News stated that this morning (31st), the "Greek Merchant" wheel arrived at the Bund Beijing Road Pier with 25,000 bags of Saigon rice. After unloading, it was transported by truck to the Bank of China warehouse on North Suzhou Road. The rice-carrying vehicles were all protected by the police, but the patrolmen did not sit next to the driver, but climbed to the top of the rice-carrying vehicles to ensure safety along the way. In addition, Chinese and Western patrolmen were stationed near the unloading pier to prevent disturbances.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Arrives</p>
<p>Not long after the rice began to be loaded onto the vehicles, about seven Japanese people in semi-uniforms arrived at the venue to record the amount of rice. It is believed that these Japanese people belong to the Japanese Army Special Service Department. It is said that for the past few months, the Japanese Army Special Service Department has sent personnel to monitor cargo transportation and shipping in the Bund area. Since the Shanghai War in 1937, the 25,000 bags that arrived this morning are the largest batch of rice shipped to Shanghai. It is said that it was purchased by Chinese and transported by a Greek merchant ship leased by the Japanese. After being unloaded, it was entrusted to the American Ruifeng Transportation Company for transportation to the warehouse. According to people from Ruifeng Company, each vehicle must travel back and forth 250 times to transport the rice from the unloading site to the warehouse, and it will be able to be completely transported tomorrow (1st).</p>
<p>Rice Prices Rise Again</p>
<p>After a large amount of foreign rice was transported to Shanghai, rice prices had fallen by more than 10 yuan in a row. However, since this week, speculators have used old tricks to hoard and manipulate prices, and prices have soared again. Yesterday, the prices of various foreign rice varieties rose by 2 to 3.5 yuan. In total, the prices of various foreign rice varieties have risen by 5 to 6 yuan in three days. The new procedures for requesting mediation stipulated by the Rice Market Management Committee are: (1) Prepare a formal letter with a seal, (2) Attach a transaction order, (3) Limited to formal transactions, (4) If mediation fails three times, please cancel the General Assembly.

<h3>Bomb Case on Avenue Foch Continues to Uncover Military Supplies; Wang, the Tenant, Never Returns; Phone Call to the Aubert House Detective Office</h3>
<p>The French Concession patrolmen searched No. 80, Lane 100, Avenue Foch, and discovered that a hand grenade exploded, killing a Russian detective, Ivanoff, and injuring a translator. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Now, according to the reporter from the Pingming News Agency, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Tenant Missing</p>
<p>The house was originally rented by Tang Zhuan (28 years old) from Guangdong. The third floor was sublet to a Wang about half a year ago. He rarely interacted with people, so the tenants in the building did not pay much attention to Wang's actions, nor did they know what profession he was engaged in. Before the incident occurred, Wang left and never returned, and his whereabouts are unknown. The patrol room is still conducting a thorough investigation of the case.</p>
<p>Continued Discovery of Military Supplies</p>
<p>At about 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, the French patrol room received a phone call from the Aubert House stating that a large number of military supplies were stored on the third floor of No. 80, directly opposite its Avenue Foch residence. The French patrol room, upon receiving the report, sent Inspector Berger, Russian detective Ivanoff, and a Chinese translator to investigate, which caused the disaster. At that time, in addition to the death of Ivanoff, shrapnel penetrated the second floor and injured another tenant, Yan Tan (61 years old). After the incident, the patrol room continued to send detectives to investigate, and seized six pistols in the room. (According to the Society News Agency, two more hand grenades were seized.)</p>
<h3>American Soldiers Whose Term of Service Has Expired Return Home on the Chaumont; Departure Date Set for the 6th of This Month; The Chaumont's Last Voyage to the Far East</h3>
<p>The English Great America Evening News stated that approximately 150 US Navy Fourth Marine Regiment soldiers whose 30-month term of service in the Far East is about to expire will leave Shanghai for the United States on the US Navy transport wheel Chaumont on August 6th. In addition, many US Asian Fleet sailors who have served in the East</p>
<p>will also return to the United States from Shanghai on the Chaumont. The Chaumont will arrive in Shanghai on August 4th, and was originally scheduled to stay for at least one week before crossing the Pacific Ocean and returning to the United States via Manira, Guam, and Honolulu. But suddenly the order was changed, and August 6th was set as the</p>
<p>Departure Date</p>
<p>The dependents of the Marine Corps soldiers and sailors will accompany the wheel. According to the US Navy Department, the Chaumont was transferred out of the Pacific at the beginning of this year, but the plan was changed again, and the wheel was sent back to the East once. Therefore, the wheel has been sailing to the East for 20 years, and this trip may be the last time it comes to the Far East. However, the current</p>
<p>world situation is unsettled, so it is impossible to predict the future voyage of the warship. In the future, the US Navy transport wheel that will sail to Shanghai may be the Wharton, which has a tonnage of 10,000 tons. The wheel was purchased by the US Navy Department from a merchant wheel company last year, and took the name of an early</p>
<p>US Marine Corps</p>
<p>commander. The Wharton is expected to cross the Pacific Ocean to Shanghai for the first time in mid-September. In addition, the US wheel Gold Star stationed on Guam sailed from the island via Yokohama and arrived in Shanghai last night (30th), and will stay for a few days before returning south to Guam, except in case of emergency. The North-China Daily News stated that the Municipal Council will not convene board meetings during the summer vacation from July 25 to May 3, unless to discuss emergency matters. However, Municipal Council staff will continue to work as usual.</p>
<h3>"Central China Company" Established by Japan, "Liuhang Receiving Station" Setup: Chinese and Foreign Circles Still Use Foreign Utilities to Avoid Inspection</h3>
<p>Since the start of the war of aggression against China by Japan, the industry, commerce, and transportation facilities in all areas where the Chinese army retreated have been illegally seized. Although the Japanese side has pretended to return factories in the occupied areas, this has not yet been realized. During the outbreak of the Shanghai war, public utilities such as the Ministry of Communications Radio Station and the Ministry of Communications Shanghai Telephone Bureau, the Zhabei and Public Works Bureau public bus companies, and utility companies were all under Japanese control following the military shift. The Japanese side then established the "Central China Company" to forcibly seize all of them and engage in restoration. Now, they intend to control the telecommunications industry, so they restored the "Zhenru Radio Transmitting Station" last year. Now, they have established the "Liuhang Radio Receiving Station" yesterday to control our original domestic and foreign telegrams and international telephone services. However, this kind of business is purely to facilitate their military operations. Chinese and foreign circles and various industries, in order to avoid illegal inspections of communication and information, are still happy to use the utilities of companies like Great Northern, Great Eastern, and Pacific.</p>
<h3>Electrical Engineer Wang Zhenji Abducted Yesterday, The Company Where He Works Was Also Searched</h3>
<p>At half past ten yesterday morning, an abduction case occurred at the entrance of Lane 214, Dachung Lane, Tongfu Road. The abducted person was Wang Zhenji, from Changshu, 39 years old. There were a total of six abductors, three from a certain foreign country and three Chinese, carrying three handguns, and driving two black-plated cars from the concession, numbers 5060 and 4022. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>The abduction: Wang Zhenji lived in the upper厢房 of No. 31, Dachung Lane, Lane 214, Tongfu Road. He was the deputy manager and engineer at the Hezong Electrical Company at No. 267, Weihaiwei Road. The company and Wang's residence are quite close, and he usually goes out early and returns late, walking to work. At half past ten yesterday morning, Wang went out from his home as usual to go to the company to work. Just as he arrived at the entrance of Dachung Lane, three foreigners and three Chinese dressed in Chinese and Western clothes suddenly drew out handguns and stopped Wang. At first, Wang didn't know what was happening and tried to resist. He was slapped twice by one of them and forced into black-plated car No. 5060, which was parked near the entrance of the Wanchunxiang Sauce Garden. The others also boarded another black-plated car No. 4022 and started the engine, driving east along Weihaiwei Road. At that time, the guard of Dachung Lane happened to be at the entrance of the lane and witnessed this scene. Being outnumbered, he could not stop it and could only watch Wang get into the car and leave. He then went directly to the Chengdu Road Police Station in charge to report the incident and sent detectives to investigate the scene. A strict investigation is underway.</p>
<p>Also Searched: It is also reported that about an hour after Wang was abducted, at 11:30 noon, three foreigners suddenly arrived at the Hezong Electrical Company (specializing in battery manufacturing) at No. 267, Weihaiwei Road, in car No. 4022 and went directly to the company's office to search it. As a result, they found nothing and got back into the original car and left. According to what the foreigner told the staff of Hezong Electrical Company at that time, the manager was detained for investigation because the company was suspected of something. However, the reason for Wang's abduction and the source of the car are currently being investigated by the police station.</p>
<h3>Forging "Passes", Multiple Criminals Arrested</h3>
<p>Ding Qiqun, from Zhenjiang, is 48 years old this year. Recently, he opened a transfer company in Room 28 of the Lushan Apartment on Juji Da Road, under the guise of which he specializes in applying for passes to various places for customers, using fraudulent means to collect money. Ma Ziliang, from Hunan (38 years old, residing at No. 29, Fengyu Lane, Sapo Sai Road), entrusted Ding Qiqun's branch office for applying for passes, located in Room 23, Xindu Apartment, Fuxu Road, on July 24 to apply for a pass to Nanjing. On the 29th, when he took the pass to a certain Japanese shipping company on the Bund of Wuma Road to buy a ship ticket, he was found by the shipping company staff to have a forged pass. Ma reported the information to the French Concession Police Station, which sent detective Shao Guanrong to arrest Ding. Under interrogation, Ding's accomplices Zhu Xicheng (26 years old, from Wuxi, residing at No. 23, Changxing Inn, Caishi Street), Yu A'ao (33 years old, from Shaoxing, residing at No. 11, Yingchunfang, Sima Road), Zhao Guilin (35 years old, from Danyang, residing at No. 34, Qingyun Lane, Beijing Road), Shi Heming (23 years old, from Ningbo, residing at No. 80, Hongji Lane, Gordon Road), and Bao Heyun (33 years old, residing at No. 107, West Street, Xujiahui) and six others were successively arrested. A large number of forged passes were found in Room 23 of the Changxing Inn, packed in a leather bag, and brought back to the police station together. It was found that the main culprit, Zhu Jianping, had fled upon hearing the news. It was also found that the defendants sold direct passes for more than three yuan each and fake passes for one yuan and five jiao each, and many had already been sold. The defendants were detained and sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court yesterday. The police station's lawyer, Yuan Jiahuang, explained the case and requested an extension for further investigation and interrogation. Then, the detectives reported the process of arresting the defendants, and the plaintiff stated the circumstances of entrusting the application for a pass and the discovery of the forgery. After Judge Zhu Chuzhe questioned the defendants, he ordered that the hearing be adjourned to August 14. The defendants were detained.</p>

<h3>Letter Received</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Regarding the news item "Rice Shop Apprentice Mistakenly Abducted, Released After Clarification" published in your newspaper on July 30, it was stated that our shop sent apprentice Shen Jinxiang to the Songshenghao shop of the same trade on Xingjiapo Road the day before yesterday to collect payments. He was kidnapped by three men holding box cannons on Jiaozhou Road and Xingjiapo Road, forced into a car, and taken south to a house at No. 22 in a certain lane. He was questioned in detail and asked if he was the young master of our rice shop. Shen knew it was a mistaken abduction and told them the truth about being an apprentice. The bandits thought it was useless to detain him and ordered him to leave. Shen escaped. After investigation, our shop has never had such an incident. The above news is obviously a misreport and untrue. We hereby submit this letter, hoping you will investigate and correct it.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>

On the morning of the day before yesterday (the 30th), at about 11:00 AM, he hid a sharp knife and went to No. 51, Lane 460, Avenue Edward VII, and without asking why, drew his knife and stabbed his wife, Zhang, twice in the waist and lower body.

<h3>Grains: Foreign Rice All Goes Into the Hands of Big Dealers, Rice Prices Soar Again to Over Three Yuan, Rice Weevils Not Eliminated, Rice Prices Difficult to Stabilize</h3>
<p>Recently, a considerable amount of foreign rice has arrived in Shanghai. The previous day, the Taikoo company's Jinan and Ninghai ships, and the Norwegian ship Herleik, managed by the Gaodeng Foreign Company, etc., brought a total of more than 50,000 bags, as noted in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the Greek ship Hellenie Trader, which directly loaded 24,723 bags from Saigon, also arrived the day before yesterday (the 30th) and docked at Pier 14, Renji Road Bund, for unloading. It was unloaded by noon yesterday, and the ship was immediately moved to another location. Yesterday, the Taikoo company's Nanning ship also arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 2,513 bags from Hong Kong, and docked at the company's pier outside the French Concession for unloading.</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot foreign rice was relatively stable in the early morning, but suddenly a fierce surge occurred, increasing by as much as three yuan. At the opening of the morning market, the original dealers firmly held their ground, and the buyers were all waiting to see. The market was flat. Unexpectedly, after a long delay, inland customers desperately sought supplies, and local shops followed suit, resulting in a situation where there were more buyers than sellers. Those with goods hoarded them, and the surge could not be contained. At the close, Saigon No. 1 had reached 56 yuan, 55.5 yuan, and new sharp 54.5 yuan. Yesterday morning, foreign rice was purchased at low prices for spot sales, and the floating goods in the market were sold out early. The big dealers refused to sell at lower prices, and inland Hangzhou gangs issued more than 10,000 new permits and immediately purchased 6,000 bags of spot rice in the market, including the previous stock. Small dealers followed suit, and the market immediately turned upward. Spot rice prices rose by two to three yuan. The No. 2 Siamese rice loaded on the 26th of last month has arrived in batches and is now all in the hands of big dealers. Those who have not covered their positions and inland dealers had to raise prices to inquire. Therefore, after the opening price of 57 yuan, it gradually increased to 60 yuan, which is 3.5 yuan higher than the previous day's 56.5 yuan. Small Siamese rice also increased by three to four yuan, resulting in no transactions. More than 400 tons of Siamese rice were offered for repurchase, and more than 10,000 bags of spot rice were offered, it is said.</p>
<p>Due to competition from foreign glutinous rice, the market for glutinous rice continued to be normal and remained unchanged, maintaining the original levels. Lijing white was 56-57 yuan per hundred, and Changdan was 54-55 yuan per hundred. Hong Kong was 55 yuan per hundred. The arrival of national rice, such as thick and thin japonica rice, was still scarce. It was rumored that the off-market dark trading was good because of the high price of foreign rice, but not as excited as the loss of rice. The selling price was only slightly higher. Changgang fresh clear japonica rice was 65-66 yuan, Wuxi clear japonica rice was 65 yuan, Changzhou Sukun japonica rice was 63-64 yuan, secondary to 61 yuan, and Su 59 yuan. Thin rice was out of stock and not open. Nangang early rice was 63 yuan per original bag, 59 yuan per dan, secondary to Su 57 yuan, etc.</p>
<h3>The Flour Market Turns Stable</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the flour market of various factories turned stable. The price of the flour factory remained at the original price of 15 yuan. Retail transactions on this street were still active, but sales to customers in Nanyang were quiet as soon as there was any movement, because the return of flour from Japan was expected soon and prices were still depreciating. It was heard that the price of the Phoenix brand for this month was only 13.35 yuan, and the price for August futures was 13.5 yuan. There were continuous transactions of 2,000-3,000 bags. Other domestic miscellaneous brands of flour had no formal settlement. According to discussions in the industry, based on the current price of wheat received by Japanese factories, which is 19 yuan, the cost of flour production cannot be less than 13 yuan. Therefore, the factory's intention to sell has turned stable.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's transactions were still not many, and the market was as tired as usual. The supply from Suxi and other areas was continuous. Both Japanese and Chinese factories lacked a smooth market. Although the sellers had the intention of holding up the prices, it was difficult to reverse the downward trend. It was heard that the purchase price of Japanese factories was only about 18 yuan, which was still 2 yuan lower than that of Chinese factories. Transactions were about 2,000-3,000 bags.</p>
<h3>The Import of Foreign Rice in June and July is Astonishing, More Than 823,300 Bags, Worth 50 Million Yuan in Legal Tender</h3>
<p>July was one of the busiest months for foreign rice imports. This newspaper has been investigating and reporting on it daily. Foreign rice arriving in Shanghai in June totaled 167,785 bags. Foreign rice arriving in Shanghai in July totaled 655,598 bags. The total for both months is 823,383 bags, which is a significant amount. In reality, it is probably even more than this number, as there are bound to be more omissions. If calculated at 60 yuan per bag in legal tender, the total value is 49,402,980 yuan, which is more than 3 million US dollars, which is truly lamentable. (Unit: bag, each bag is calculated at 200 kilograms)</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Drops in a Straight Line</h3>
<p>In the securities grey market yesterday, the market was calculated after deducting the interest of the ninth issue. It was found that the net interest right after deducting income tax was 2.85 yuan. The market price, after deducting this number, was equal to the market price of the previous day. Unexpectedly, after the opening, many parties rushed to sell, and all returned to a little more than 3 yuan, to 3.5 yuan. The shorts took advantage of the situation to exert pressure, and the market price fell in a straight line. For half a day, after deducting the interest rights, it was still a little less than 0.3 to 0.6 or 0.7 yuan. It was inevitable that the drop was too fast. In the afternoon, it caused the short sellers to cover their positions, and in an instant, it rebounded by 0.3, 0.5, or 0.6 yuan. The market's volatility, although due to human factors, was actually controlled by the environment. The trend turned into one of easy highs and difficult lows. Yesterday morning, the Yongkang, Xie Da, and  Fu bought the most, and Jiufeng continued to sell consistently. Xinchang and Shengda also sold off. The market price fell sharply. In the afternoon, the news was better, and the buying interest suddenly increased. Hongda and Renchang collected Class A, and other types, except for Class D, were mostly absorbed by Lianhe, Songmao, Dafeng, and Dakangcheng. Jiufeng increased its short positions, Yongkang slightly sold back, and Yichang and retail investors also settled their transactions. Therefore, the afternoon market rebounded more strongly. As a result, it was 2.65 yuan to 2.9 yuan lower than the Lianli market price. Class D was a little more than 3.4 yuan lower because it did not trade in the afternoon. After deducting the interest rights, the fluctuations were minimal, mostly only 0.1 or 0.2 yuan higher or lower. The total transaction volume was about 900,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below (the table is for the value after deduction of good interest):</p>
<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 11.25 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, yesterday's stock market closed at the Public Industry Association with a very firm trend, but the activity was difficult to sustain. The price remained extraordinarily stable throughout the day. If the New York market can maintain a firm trend, the market conditions here will have more progress. Although investors are currently somewhat doubtful about operations due to the instability of the situation in this port.</p>
<p>London, 30th (Tuesday) Electric: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debts and Far East British companies' stocks have returned to calm. Only the stock of the Mercantile Bank of India, London and China continued to rise by one shilling and three pence, with a price of six pounds sixteen shillings and three pence.

The market immediately tightened after the opening. Chinese banks and the mainland first ate foreign bank's August US exchange rate of 5.9375 yuan. Later, Chinese merchant speculators and foreign firms also followed suit and scooped up the same month's US exchange rate, and foreign banks were said to have sold the August US exchange rate of 5.90625 yuan and 9375 yuan to Sassoon speculators.

<h3>The Gold Market Goes Against the Decline in Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Shanghai cash market, after rising sharply, suddenly fell sharply, eventually falling against foreign exchange by 65 yuan. This was actually because the small money shops tended to sell on behalf of the scattered parties, and there was a lack of buyers to maintain it. The confidence of all parties, which had been trending firmly for a long time, has turned tired. The market opened in the morning, following the rising trend of the previous day. The foreign exchange rate was reported tight, and the market opened as high as 5,510 yuan. Due to the buying wind in the silver shop, the high price of 5,535 yuan was seen. In less than half an hour, the foreign exchange rate suddenly broke the soft trend of only tightening and not returning for three days, and turned to return to firmness. The money changers frantically sold off, and those who entered waited and watched. The price gradually fell to 5,410 yuan. Although it rose slightly at noon, it eventually fell again. The closing price was 5,415 yuan, a decrease of 65 yuan. The half-day transaction volume was about 2,000 taels. No market in the afternoon on Wednesday. The price of decorative gold rose and then returned to flat, and customs gold, etc., were all flat.</p>
<p>Gold Falls by 65 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels), initially because the foreign exchange market was reported tight, there were still many buyers, and the market opened up 30 yuan, to 5,510 yuan. Later, due to the strong advance of the silver shops, it rose again by 25 yuan. The silver shops advanced to the gold shop by 20 taels, to 5,535 yuan. Then, as the foreign exchange rate turned loose, the gold shops, money changers, and silver shops rushed to sell, and at that time, peace rumors suddenly rose in the market, and there were few entrants, so it fell back by 95 yuan. The securities firms exited the silver shop by 20 taels, at 5,440 yuan. Later, thanks to the silver shop and securities firms purchasing, it once rose by more than 20 yuan. However, as the foreign exchange rate continued to ease, the money changers sold again when it was high. In addition, the floating positions absorbed last month were limited to losses and exits, and it fell again by 55 yuan. The money changers advanced to the silver shop by 20 taels, which was slightly less than 5,410 yuan. The selling wind subsided slightly at noon, and it once returned to the edge of 5,450 yuan, but in the end, because the money changers came to sell again, the closing price was still only 5,415 yuan, a decrease of 65 yuan compared to the previous day. The market momentum turned slightly after closing, and transactions were once made at 5,430 yuan. The highest bid was once over 5,440 yuan. The price fluctuated by 125 yuan in half a day. The selling price of the spot gold of the cash shop was several yuan higher than the price of gold, and the purchase price was reduced by 30 yuan.

<p>Decorative Gold Rises and then Returns to Flat</p>

There were no changes after that. It is estimated that Datong Bank still hung 560 yuan, the new banks were similar to the above price, and the purchase was reduced by 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Financial Review - Continued (End)</h3>
<p>— Saint Kai</p>
<p>Up to July 27th</p>
<p>From the above analysis, it is evident that Japan's surge in exports to the Yen Bloc has created a trade deficit for Japan, which is indeed a major crisis for Japan's wartime economy. The Japanese authorities are also deeply aware of this unfavorable situation and have repeatedly imposed restrictions on exports to the Yen Bloc. In July 1938, restrictions were placed on exports to Japanese-occupied areas such as Manchuria, North China, and Central China, including cotton yarn and cotton cloth. Subsequently, these restrictions were gradually extended to wool products, rubber products, felt hats, soap, etc. However, due to the soaring prices within the Yen Bloc, exports to the Yen Bloc remained strong. Consequently, on September 20, 1939, the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry announced the "Regulations for Adjusting Exports to Manchuria, Kwantung, North China, and Central China," stipulating that exports of goods not intended for domestic consumption within the Yen Bloc, goods intended to expand domestic production capacity, and daily necessities for the people could not be exported to the Yen Bloc without approval. Despite these repeated restrictions on trade with the Yen Bloc, the trend continued to rise. Looking at this year's trade statistics, it can be said that Japan's export trade is almost entirely with the Yen Bloc, while its import trade is entirely with third countries.</p>
<p>Recently, the President of the Japanese Planning Board, in a speech, announced the major wartime financial and economic plan decided by the temporary cabinet meeting on July 18th. Among them, the plan for Yen Bloc trade is to maintain the balance of international payments between the parties in order to promote the sound development of the Yen economic group, so that the exchange of materials between Japan and various parts of the Yen area can be smooth, and to seek the stability of the Yen currency and the stabilization of prices. The three key points of this plan are: (1) Without hindering the progress of Japan in maintaining its third-party exports and the scope required for the people's livelihood, Japan should supply as many materials as possible to the Yen area, to the extent permitted by the local situation; (2) In order to adapt to the consumption control policies in various regions and maintain the Yen currency policy, appropriate measures should be selected for the exchange of materials; (3) How to plan for the balance of international payments for the trade surplus of the Yen area.</p>
<p>However, no matter what measures are taken under this plan, it will not reduce the trade difficulties caused to Japan by its trade surplus with the Yen area. On the contrary, the first principle in the plan may increase the trade surplus with the Yen area. It must be understood that if Japan's war of aggression in China continues without stopping, the Yen currency will inflate day by day. However, although the Yen currency can be put into circulation under the bayonets, its value cannot be maintained solely by bayonets. It can only generate its exchange value by exporting goods. As a result, the Yen currency inflates as much as possible, and the more exports to the Yen area, the greater the trade surplus. I would like to provide a statistic here for reference. The following table is the foreign trade index of Japan (with the first half of 1937 as 100):</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Speculation Resurrects; Double Horse Brand Rebounds by Eleven Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market has turned better and is showing an upward trend again. This is because the exchange rate contracted in the afternoon of the previous day, and people's hearts were excited. As a result, speculation has once again stirred up waves, and the atmosphere is boiling. The bulls have reorganized their forces and come back strongly. The high price once reached 999 yuan. However, it was reported that actual sales were not very smooth, and a major bull instead left the market, causing prices to fall.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened this morning. Because the price of gold was slightly higher in the afternoon of the previous day, the bulls generally promoted it vigorously. The market was bustling with activity, and the opening price rose by 20 yuan. The price of 20-count Double Horse brand was 990 yuan, which immediately rose to 999 yuan. However, due to weak transactions from the merchant guilds and the relaxation of drafts, the market sentiment suddenly softened, and prices fell to 983 yuan. It is found that the statistics of transactions in half a day are 1,370 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse brand rose by 11 yuan. The amount of each guild's purchase is listed as follows:</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Transactions are Slightly Sparse</h3>
<p>The general trend of spot cotton transactions is still ordinary. The factory stomach is not strong. Although Japanese factories have occasional needs, the payment period is still delayed by one month. Chinese factories, in view of the ordinary environment, have absolutely no intention of purchasing and hoarding. In fact, silver funds have not been relaxed. Only occasional transactions between colleagues have been negotiated. The market is also not far from a hovering situation. Tongzhou cotton is 170 yuan, and American cotton is 260 yuan. The transaction is 300 to 400 pieces delivered at the warehouse.</p>
<p>Another news is the market price of foreign cotton. The New York cotton market is in good condition. The industry has made some purchases. The prices of Wall Street stocks are high, and some short positions have been covered. As a result, the closing price rose by four or five points compared to the previous day. The Indian market is calm. Yesterday, the forecast fell by more than one rupee.</p>
<p>The trade of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been very quiet recently. All parties are holding a wait-and-see attitude due to the end of the month. Yesterday, due to the tightening of exchange rates, people's hearts were strengthened.</p>
<h3>Oil Cake: Domestic Sales of Soybean Cake Continue</h3>
<p>Since the soybean cake market turned active at the end of last week, domestic sales have continued unabated. In addition, the price of soybeans is high, so the market atmosphere has been strongly supported, and market prices have risen even higher. Although there were no inquiries for exports yesterday, the market price still increased by three or four jiao. It is estimated that 3,000 pieces of Shengji cake were sold at 11 yuan, 100 pieces of Changji cake were sold at 10 yuan and 5 jiao and a half, and 1,200 pieces of Feizi cake were sold at 10 yuan and 9 jiao and a half to 8 jiao. 1,500 pieces of Qingzhong cake were sold at 10 yuan and 2 jiao to 10 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Spot Sales of Cotton Cloth Remain Good</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market initially rose and then weakened, and as a result, it rebounded again, presenting a hovering situation. The range of sales has narrowed, with a high-low difference of only one jiao and a half. Spot sales remain good, and the attitude of those holding goods is quite calm. However, inventory is still extremely thick. Future transactions lack interest from buyers. This street traded more than 500 pieces of spot coarse cloth, grey cloth, bleached and dyed cloth, and more than 200 pieces of future velvet cloth. The Fujian guild traded more than 100 pieces of dyed twill and serge. The Guangdong and Hong Kong guilds traded nearly 200 pieces of twill and dyed cloth. The Wenzhou and Ningbo guilds traded nearly 100 pieces of Lunchang dyed cloth, Yihua twill, and coarse cloth. The northern Yan and Tianjin guilds traded more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth and velvet cloth.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse White Sugar Rises by About Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market rose because of external rumors that the situation in the Dutch East Indies was deteriorating and that the source of Dutch sugar might be obstructed. Therefore, the guild's price was raised. The spot price of 24 coarse white sugar at the local warehouse was 67 yuan and a half to 68 yuan and a half, while the price at the foreign warehouse was initially 67 yuan and 3 jiao to 5 jiao, and rose further to 68 yuan and 68 yuan and a half in the afternoon. The price of transshipment goods for delivery on August 2nd was 51 yuan and a half to 51 yuan and 8 jiao, and 52 yuan to 53 yuan in the afternoon. The price for delivery on the 15th was 52 yuan and a half to 53 yuan and 4 jiao. The price of Taikoo coarse white B mark was 72 yuan and a half to 73 yuan in the morning, and 73 yuan and a half to 74 yuan in the afternoon. The price of Dutch red sugar at the local warehouse was 61 yuan and a half, and the price of local factory snow white was 68 yuan to 69 yuan, a rise of two yuan and a half. The price of Ben No. 1 ice sugar was 90 yuan, and the price of Jingming ice sugar was 91 yuan and a half, both rising by three yuan. Also, 5,900 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong yesterday, and another 4,000 bags arrived, which were transferred to Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Black Pepper Falls by Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Recently, the black pepper market has continued to decline due to sluggish sales. Black Big and No. 1 pepper fell by another two yuan, and sold for 101 yuan yesterday. However, white pepper remains stable. The price of Wendao goods is 202 yuan, and the price of Dutch goods is 190 yuan.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: More than 3,000 Boxes of Haikou Branches Arrive</h3>
<p>After the new Haikou branches were launched, due to the blockade of the Haikou in Zhejiang and Fujian by a certain party, the local merchants telegraphed to the production area to stop loading. However, the third batch has already been shipped and is en route. Yesterday, a total of 3,300 boxes arrived by the Qingyuan ship, and it is expected that the market will open within a few days.</p>
<h3>Metals: American Bar Iron Market is Firm</h3>
<p>The trade of American bar iron has long been stopped by foreign merchants. Those who can support the remaining situation rely only on the occasional purchases of toy factories, printing factories, cigarette factories, and canneries in this street. However, sales have also been greatly reduced compared to the past (because their products are sluggish in the market). It is found that about 100 boxes were traded yesterday. The market was firm yesterday because the exchange rate tightened again, and people's hearts became firm. As yesterday's asking price for unified floral patterns was 120 yuan, large sizes were 130 to 140 yuan, and small floral patterns were sold for about 110 yuan per box.</p>

<h3>Old Newspaper Excerpts - 67 Years Ago (462) (See This Newspaper from the Twelfth Year of Tongzhi, Qing Dynasty)</h3>
<p>Local Constable</p>
<p>The system of local constables originated from the new law of Wang Anshi during the Song Dynasty. The law was based on the Rites of Zhou, where one person was appointed in each village to be responsible. This was a variation and expansion of the baojia system. Therefore, all the new laws were abolished, but the baojia system has been followed to this day. Similarly, the establishment of local constables has also been maintained. Considering the meaning of the name, a local constable is one who is responsible for the safety of the local area. In the beginning, they were generally selected from among the more reputable people in the village. Later, the original intention was gradually lost, and many local constables in the villages were idle and unscrupulous people. As a result, the establishment of local constables became more of a detriment than a benefit. Up to this day, the further we are from the past, the more corrupt people's hearts become, and the more degraded the local baojia system becomes. The weak ones fill the position in name only, and are incapable of doing anything. The strong ones collude with government runners and have private dealings with clerks. They might say that so-and-so in the county is their relative, or that Mr. So-and-so in the yamen is their good friend. The ignorant villagers, believing that they have connections with the government, dare not offend them in the slightest, lest they incur blame. As a result, they abuse their power, oppress the villagers, demand tribute during festivals, and extort gifts for birthdays. Whenever there is an incident, they complicate matters, indulge in their greed, and carry out their cunning schemes. In famous and respected families, they might restrain themselves and not be too reckless. However, in remote and poor villages, far from the city, where the government's eyes and ears cannot reach, these people become even more unscrupulous and do whatever they want.</p>

<h3>Trust and Understanding</h3>
<p>Trust and understanding are related. The amount of trust one has is determined by the amount of understanding. Trust and distrust depend entirely on understanding or lack thereof. This is true in all interactions between people. If I understand someone, I trust them. The clearer the understanding, the greater the trust.</p>
<p>All the disputes in the world, whether international, national, familial, or between individuals, are due to a lack of understanding of God, a lack of trust in God, and a lack of reverence for God, allowing God to be our master and our king. At the same time, it is also because we overestimate ourselves. "I" want this, "I" want that. The word "I" is piled higher than Mount Tai. In everything, we rely on "my" intelligence, "my" talent, and "my" social skills, driving God to the far corners of the sky, with no God in our minds at all.</p>
<p>Many poets who believed in God in the past said in their poems: "In God I trust; I will not be afraid. What can mortal man do to me?" (Psalm 56). "Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me, for in you my soul takes refuge; in the shadow of your wings I will take refuge, till the disaster has passed..." (Psalm 57).</p>
<p>Dear readers! We believe that there is a God in the universe. We understand Him, we trust Him. Looking at it vertically, for two thousand years, Christianity has had countless believers who have accomplished many great works because they understood this God and trusted this God. Looking at it horizontally, although wars are raging in various countries of the world today, the missionary work, educational work, medical work, and various other charitable works of Christianity are still moving forward without discouragement because they understand this God and trust this God.</p>
<p>Are you also willing to understand this God so that after understanding Him, you can trust His leadership in all aspects of your life, no longer suffer from gains and losses, and become a persistent and unyielding person? (Reprinted on August 4th)</p>

<h3>Basic Principles of Child Education</h3>
<p>— Compiled and Written</p>
<p>Many people kindly and simply ask: "How should children be educated?" This is truly a long story and almost impossible to answer. However, here are some basic principles of child education that may be used as reference material for parents with good intentions:</p>
<p>(1) Be gentle, patient, firm, not angry, and do not lose your temper.</p>
<p>(2) Consider everything for the benefit and future of the child, and administer rewards and punishments fairly and justly.</p>
<p>(3) Do not be afraid of crying.</p>
<p>(4) Replace prohibition with encouragement.</p>
<p>(5) Minimize punishment as much as possible. When punishing, be fair and make the child understand where they went wrong.</p>
<p>(6) When a problem occurs, it should be resolved immediately or as soon as possible. Do not delay unless necessary.</p>
<p>(7) Do not scold children in front of others. Never hurt a child's self-esteem.</p>
<p>(8) Help children do things, but only to a certain extent, with the aim of cultivating children's independence and self-reliance.</p>
<p>(9) Be consistent in attitude.</p>
<p>(10) Parents should be consistent in attitude.</p>
<p>(11) Set a good example.</p>
<p>(12) Treat children as sensible people.</p>

<h3>Ten Agreements</h3>
<p>— Wang Chuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, I received two letters from readers of Free Talk, forwarded by the editor, saying that after reading my article "I Bless My Younger Brother," they were very envious that I had such a younger brother and hoped that I would publish the ten agreements that my brother and I had made in Free Talk. Now I have obtained my brother's consent and copied them down, adding some explanations.</p>
<p>(1) The signatories shall not purchase foreign goods, except when unavoidable;</p>
<p>(2) When going to school or going out, they shall not take first-class trams;</p>
<p>(3) From the date of signing the agreement until the victory of the war of resistance, they shall not watch movies or dramas, except for those that are meaningful;</p>
<p>(4) The signatories must learn two special skills (within one year);</p>
<p>(5) About one-tenth of the monthly allowance should be used to buy extracurricular books to read;</p>
<p>(6) Read the newspaper every day;</p>
<p>(7) Write a diary every day;</p>
<p>(8) Do not quarrel with A-Ling</p>
<p>(9) Do not play chess every day to kill useful time;</p>
<p>(10) Do not smoke cigarettes.</p>
<p>The above ten articles were signed in April last year, more than a year ago. In that year, we were very careful at first, fearing that we would violate the agreement. After three or four months, we got used to it. For example, when it comes to taking the tram, as soon as the tram arrives at the station, I will step into the third-class carriage without thinking. Even if I meet friends on the road, I don't feel any unnaturalness.</p>
<p>Some of the articles in this agreement were made entirely to suit my younger brother and me. For example, article 6, A-Ling is the maid in my house. She has a meddlesome and gossipy mouth, so my younger brother often quarreled with her in the past. This article can be said to be biased towards restricting my younger brother. Other things like smoking and playing chess are my shortcomings, so the agreement was made for me.</p>
<p>When my younger brother and I "met" to discuss the agreement, my younger brother also raised the question of how to punish those who violated it. My younger brother and I have not yet become independent in terms of economy, so I came up with a method of spiritual punishment. That is, whoever violates the agreement must sit silently for an hour. During that hour, they are only allowed to sit and repent, and are not allowed to speak. This method was adopted by us and proved to be very effective.</p>
<p>When the other party violates the agreement, you must not gloat, but instead show that you forgive him this time and advise him not to do it again next time. This will make the other party feel a kind of spiritual reproach, and they will definitely not commit the same mistake easily in the future. I think this method can also be used by parents to punish their children.</p>
<h3>Ordinary</h3>
<p>— Fang Jing</p>
<p>Many people ignore the ordinary.</p>
<p>But we say: There is learning in the ordinary.</p>
<p>Look, wasn't Watt's invention of steam encountered in the ordinary act of boiling water? Wasn't Newton's discovery of gravity obtained from the ordinary event of an apple falling to the ground?</p>
<p>There is learning in the ordinary, may everyone pay attention to the ordinary!</p>
<p>The Hawthorne Case</p>
<h3>The Homecoming of the Dancing Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>"Hawthorne, it's only half past nine now. Jiang Anna has only been back for two hours of sleep, it would be unreasonable for us to wake her up."</p>
<p>Hawthorne frowned. "We can't worry about that, the matter is urgent and can't be delayed too long. I only hope to talk to her for fifteen minutes, and she can sleep again."</p>
<p>We have found the door to room 306. Hawthorne hesitated slightly, then bent the index finger of his right hand and knocked on the door three times. There was no reply inside. I noticed that there was no doorbell next to the door, so I also raised my fist to help him knock twice. The reply finally came.</p>
<p>"Who? - Who's knocking?"</p>
<p>The voice was loud and hurried, clearly containing some fear.</p>
<p>I said in a surprised whisper: "That's a man's voice! Can't we be wrong?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne shook his head. "Is that worth wondering? Can't you hear that this is a voice startled from sleep - Damn!" After he finished speaking, he turned around, preparing to turn back.</p>
<p>There was a second voice inside: "Who is it? What's the matter?" This was a woman's voice. I said again: "It's Anna. Why are you leaving?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne suddenly sank his face. "What are we going to do in there?... Alas, the corrupt Shanghai, the cursed sixth commandment!" He quickly walked towards the elevator room, a kind of annoyance and grief floating on his face, and a long sigh came out of his mouth.</p>
<p>Hawthorne had no further words, but I had already understood. I really felt disappointed and couldn't help but sigh inwardly: "The cursed sixth commandment!"</p>
<p>As we walked down the stone steps of the apartment, Hawthorne asked me as he opened the car door with the key. "Are we going back?"</p>
<p>"No, let's find Zhao Boxiong."</p>
<p>"Do you know his address too?" Because when Jin Mei and old Mao Wu Ma talked just now, they didn't mention Zhao Boxiong's address, and Hawthorne didn't ask about it either. (62)</p>

<h3>Struggle</h3>
<p>— Pinpin</p>
<p>Those who sow in tears will reap with songs of joy. Those who go out weeping, carrying seed to sow, will return with songs of joy, carrying sheaves with them.</p>
<p>——"Psalm" 126</p>
<p>Life needs tempering, life is a struggle.</p>
<p>For example, a seed buried in the cold ground, beaten by the north wind, and drowned by rain and snow, what a great difficulty this is; but it is not afraid of tempering, clenches its teeth and struggles, and survives the winter, the seed breaks through everything and sprouts, and the sun first gives it a baptism, what a great joy this is. If the seed cannot withstand the severe cold, it will remain in the dark forever. - Life is just such a struggling seed.</p>
<p>Winter is long, but spring will always come; suffering may be heavy, but happiness will always approach you step by step. We can say that there is heavy suffering in the world, but if you know how to struggle, difficulties will be picked open for you, and you will find that the crushed cave is actually a happy gemstone. Do you want to get the gemstone? You must first learn to endure hardship.</p>
<p>You must have a pair of hands that are calloused, a pair of feet that are blistered and swollen, a chest covered with scars, and a mouth without saliva (you stumble in the desert of life, and a heart like a camel: these are your weapons, on the battlefield of life. Dragged a heavy cart of a thousand catties, walked a thousand miles of thorny roads, suffered a thousand whippings, shouted a thousand times of Hang Yu, your suffering is enough - look, an oasis over there!</p>
<p>Struggle, fall and get up again, struggle again, and paradise is ahead. This is a long journey, but once you reach your destination, the glorious crown will be placed on your head.</p>
<p>I don't admit that babies don't need to struggle, look at how they grab things and learn to walk. Many people want to learn from babies, thinking that there is happiness without struggle, this is an illusion, unless you learn to rot - a rotting corpse is cursed, quickly turn back and learn from the seed that overwinters.</p>
<p>The so-called camel's heart is unwavering." There are mirages in the desert, be careful, although it is not a material difficulty, it is a temptation for the spirit. In a lifetime, I don't know how many vicious temptations jump around, you can't waver, otherwise, your destiny is like a fish on a hook. The camel ignores the mirage and walks with a calm and determined pace: you must do this. Once you have an unwavering spirit, no temptation can hook you, what are you afraid of, brave man, your spirit is also armored.</p>
<p>All the maxims, fairy tales, creeds, biographies, all talk about the same thing: struggle, then victory. Are you crying now? Thank it, you will laugh because of it. We are struggling indefinitely, and the time for us to turn over has also arrived. Break through difficulties, kick away temptations, struggle, liberation appears, do you say right?</p>
<h3>Ode to Children</h3>
<p>— Xiu Bi</p>
<p>I don't know when, I became a person who likes to play and live with children.</p>
<p>Naive emotions, pure hearts, no fraud, no schemes.</p>
<p>In their dictionaries, there is no hypocrisy, in their simple smiles, there is no hidden knife.</p>
<p>They jump, they sing, they say whatever they want, they don't know sarcasm, they don't know how to say one thing and mean another. They also don't know how to keep their secrets.</p>
<p>They often regard all people in the world as innocent and non-deceptive as themselves. How do they know that the sins of the world have long since caused adults to lose their honesty and non-deception? Therefore, they are easily deceived and cheated.</p>
<p>They are also often lovers of truth, and in their childish words, immortal truths are often revealed. They love the country, love freedom, and love all the goodness and beauty in the world.</p>
<p>They are also often lovers of light, they cry or tremble when they encounter darkness, and they laugh or jump when they encounter light. They are lovers of light, enemies of darkness and demons.</p>
<p>Ah! Children! Since I have encountered too much deception in the world, I have become your best companion. Your naiveté has retained my childlike heart.</p>

<h3>Dorothy Lamour</h3>
<p>— Written by</p>
<p>Dorothy Lamour is not only good at acting, but also at writing. In the past, newspapers and magazines often published her articles on beauty and fitness. Recently, she published a short confessional essay, which, although having the side effect of promotion, is not without considerable value. I have translated it below:</p>
<p>In every city where I star in a film, I completely separate myself from America. For example, in "Her Jungle Love," "Jungle Princess," "Typhoon" and "Aloma of the South Seas," I always wrap myself in a sarong and drift on a tropical desert island. In "Alaskan Holiday," I am in Alaska; in "South of the Border," I am in Mexico; in "Last Train from Madrid," I am in Spain. But no matter what, I was born in New Orleans, and my ancestors have lived there for generations.</p>
<p>Movies are appreciated by people regardless of nationality. In principle, Hollywood should try to make universal films as much as possible. However, films like "The Iron Horse," "The Covered Wagon," and simple Hardy family and Jones family films are purely "American" films, but they are welcomed by various countries.</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope to have the opportunity to star in an American film. Perhaps I am a little envious, because British actresses like Madeleine Carroll and Merle Oberon always play American women in their Hollywood films. This is not that I want to exclude "imports," because there are countless excellent actors from abroad in Hollywood, and the company will never do anything so stupid. However, I think it is always a good idea for Americans to play Americans.</p>
<h3>Cantonese Opera on a Deserted Island</h3>
<p>— Lishi</p>
<p>The base of Cantonese opera is mostly in Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau. It is also distributed in Southeast Asia, such as Singapore, where there are many Cantonese overseas Chinese. As for Shanghai, before the "January 28th" Incident, Cantonese opera was often performed at the Guang Wu Stage on Qiujiang Road. Before the "August 13th" Incident, it was performed at the Guangdong Grand Theater on North Sichuan Road and at the Mingzhu Grand Theater (later renamed Haizhu Grand Theater) on Fusheng Road. The Shanghai Grand Theater at the intersection of Qiujiang Road also performed for a long time. After the August 13th Incident, the Cantonese opera troupes returned south one after another. Later, the Cantonese Opera Association in Hong Kong prohibited troupes from performing in the occupied areas. Therefore, after the war moved westward and Shanghai fell, the troupes did not revisit this place for a long time. Only the Wing On Amateur Opera Troupe performed Cantonese opera for disaster relief until last year, when two or three actors came to Shanghai for leisure and formed a "Ren Shou Nian" troupe, which performed for a long time at the Gengxin Stage. Later, due to poor organization, lack of talent, and housing problems, it only appeared briefly for a few shows. This spring, another "Da Luo Tian" Cantonese opera troupe was formed, but because the stage was too small and the seats were uncomfortable (because it was only temporarily located in the small theater of the Dahua Hotel), they struggled to survive until today, and have moved again to the small theater in the Xiaoyao Ballroom to perform.</p>
<p>Cantonese opera in Shanghai can only be watched by Cantonese overseas Chinese. Outsiders simply do not understand it at all. Therefore, even if the skills are profound and the voice is pleasant, it can only be appreciated by Cantonese overseas Chinese alone, and cannot be enjoyed by the public like Peking opera. Also, because the lyrics of Cantonese opera are special, the only way to attract people from other provinces to watch is to print and distribute the lyrics for people to follow and listen, so as to avoid cultural barriers in the drama.</p>
<h3>Old Shadows, New Copies</h3>
<p>— Luo Cun</p>
<p>The first domestic sound film with speech was "After the Rain," produced by Huaguang Company, and premiered at the Xinguang Grand Theater on July 1, 1931.</p>
<p>The first Western sound film was "Captain Swagger," which premiered at the Xia Ling Pei Ke Grand Theater—now the Dahua—in February 1929.</p>
<p>The earliest cinema in Shanghai was the "Hongkou Grand Theater," founded by a Westerner named Lamos.</p>
<p>The first person to quarrel with a company over the order of advertising rankings was Xu Qinfang.</p>
<p>Eight years ago, the Educational Film Association held a domestic film competition, and as a result, "Humanity" was ranked first.</p>
<p>In June 1933, Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Fairbanks came to China to film in Tibet, but were rejected by the Chinese government and abandoned the plan.</p>
<p>In April 1933, Luo Mingyou opened the Lianhua Grand Theater in Manila. On the opening day, Zi Luolan and Chen Yanyan performed on stage, and the situation was unprecedented.</p>
<p>When the late actress Ruan Lingyu was buried, more than 20,000 fans voluntarily participated in the funeral, and the situation at that time can be said to be unprecedented.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing Native Place Association Hosts Fundraising and Low-Priced Grain Amusement Fair</h3>
<p>— Xin Ying</p>
<p>Everyone knows that this time the rice shortage in Shaoxing is quite serious. Until now, the food panic in the seven counties of Shaoxing has not been resolved. Therefore, in order to relieve the fellow villagers, the Shaoxing Shanghai Native Place Association, in addition to running around appealing to all walks of life, will hold a four-day amusement fundraising and low-priced grain fair at the Carlton Grand Theater from August 1st to 4th. According to the scheduled entertainment program, the first and second days will be Yue opera performances, and the third and fourth days will be Peking opera performances.</p>
<p>Regarding Yue opera, the daytime play "The Sinking Fragrance Fan" and the nighttime play "The Sad History of Liang Zhu" have been scheduled for the first day. The daytime play "Pan Fu Suo Fu" and the nighttime play "Green Jade Hairpin" will be performed on the second day. The actors include Yao Shuijuan, Tu Xinghua, Shang Fangchen, Zhu Su'e, Shi Yinhua, Ma Zhanghua, Wang Shuihua, Lü Shengkui, Li Xiaonong, Xing Zhuqin and more than twenty others.</p>
<p>The Peking opera program has been scheduled for the third day's daytime plays as "Running to the Moon," "Taking Luoyang," "Yin Yang River," "Beheading the Son at the Gate," "Elegant View Tower," and "Cutting Hair to Replace the Head." Nighttime plays include "Five Flower Cave," "Old General Wins the Victory," "Mu Kezhai," "Nine More Days," "Farewell Kiln," "Night Battle with Ma Chao," "Baolian Lantern," and "Splitting the Mountain to Rescue the Mother." The fourth day's daytime plays are "Iron Bow Marriage," "Sea Tide Pearl," "Dragon and Phoenix Auspiciousness," and "Eight Great Hammers." Nighttime plays include "Colored Building Matching," "Attack on Eastern Wu," "Song Shi Hui," "Siping Mountain," and Hong Jing Xi.</p>
<p>Actors such as Zhou Xinfang, Zhao Ruquan, Li Ruchun, Mao Shilai, Ai Shiju, Zhang Yipeng, Feng Zihe, Wang Xichun, Huang Guiqiu, Yuan Shihai, Jiang Miaoxiang, and more than twenty others.</p>
<p>From the above-arranged programs, it is not difficult for us to see that both Yue opera and Peking opera are very exciting. It is said that enthusiastic people from all walks of life are very active in purchasing tickets this time. It is the same as watching a play, but this time it can save many Shaoxing compatriots. Moreover, famous actors perform famous plays, which not only satisfies the eyes but also helps the disaster-stricken people. It is really a win-win situation, so why not do it!</p>
<h3>East, South, West, North</h3>
<p>After Li Qinian arrived in Shanghai, the first film she starred in has been decided as "Liang Hongyu."</p>
<p>Chen Yunshang's new work "The Creation of Heaven and Earth" will begin filming, directed by Zhang Shankun, with a script by Zhou Yibai.</p>
<p>Zheng Junli, Han Zhongliang and others, who were sent by "China" to the Xikang area to film documentaries on the anti-Japanese construction of various ethnic groups, have arrived in Qinghai and are starting work.</p>
<h3>How is a Movie Made? (3)</h3>
<p>— De Gang</p>
<p>(4) The Use and Skill of the Camera: When the photographer shakes the dial of the camera, he records the actions of the actors on the film. According to physics and optical research, we know that if sixteen or more still images are moved in front of an ordinary person's eyes per second, then the eyes will not feel discontinuous. The structure of the camera is based on this principle. Under normal rhythm, it can film sixteen images per second, which is equivalent to the dial rotating twice. If the photographer speeds up the dial rate, rotating it four times per second, then the actions of the characters in the filmed film will be "slow motion." Every move of the actors is twice as slow as normal. This can also be said to be an example of Einstein's theory of relativity. If, on the contrary, the photographer shakes the dial slowly, then the actions of the characters in the film will be particularly accelerated. For example, a plot we often see in ordinary films: a car thief speeds away in a car, followed by many police officers desperately driving motorcycles to chase after him. Their flying-like speed is shocking, but in fact, this is entirely a photographic technique. Originally, the actors playing robbers and police officers drove the cars slowly and moved forward very slowly when filming, but the photographer shook the dial particularly slowly, making the actions seem to become extremely fast. In addition to this method, cutting out one of every two films can also make the actions seem faster.</p>
<p>Also, in the film, we often see that when one scene ends and enters another different scene, the people and things in the first scene gradually disappear like fog, while the characters in the second scene gradually appear slightly transparent. This is also achieved by using camera skills. The method is very simple. When filming the end of the first scene, the photographer gradually closes the lens aperture, so the characters gradually disappear. When the lens aperture is gradually opened, the characters in the second scene gradually appear. People who do not know it think this is a very mysterious and interesting thing.</p>
