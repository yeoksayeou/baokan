<h3 id="c3">這是日本對美的新答復 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>美日協會前天在東京為日本新任駐美大使野村設宴餞行，即在席次，美國駐日大使格魯與日本外務大臣松岡二氏各有演說；二人所說要旨，皆登昨日報端。凡是關心國際事情的人們，必然理解這類塲面不是無聊的酬酢，這類宣示不是酒酣耳熱的隨便談談，這類辯答不是血脈僨張的意氣相逞，實是一般正式折衝以外的最嚴肅而重要的表現。</p>
<p>外交人員有種種不同的作風，外交辭令的工拙則亦往往相去　壊。想像松岡必是面孔永遠不會發赤的大謊言家，他能明知詭辯不夠使人折服，但仍有侃侃而談的勇氣；向他這一類作風，求之今昔的外交圈內，並非罕見，故不算特別可憎；他祇外交人員，並非自覺負有成敗責任的大政治家，故以這一類信不信由你，成不成有由他的基本觀念，作為衡量的尺度，倒可稱許他工於外交辭令。他說：在日本一計謀之新秩序下，絕無征略，絕無壓迫，絕無利己之開拓；又說日本的政治勢力，應限於日本有至要關係的範圍，「而不應展至其他人民之疆界」；又說日本「今所從事者，爲一種道德的十字軍，今方力圖根據公道公理互益，在大東亞開始一持久和平，無限繁榮之新時代」。他似乎竭力聲明，情甘保證；以前乃至於現在，在鴨綠江之北，在東海黃海之西，確確實實，明明白白，絕對沒有一個日本兵；美國人或無論誰何，若說是有的，那便是「毀謗」，那便是「有心以無心的誤會」。如此云云，誰復有糾正他的勇氣，更豈有辯論的必要？也許美大使格魯氏拙於外交辭令吧！僅僅簡單的答復說：「眞正有價値者，厥爲事實與行爲，至於掩蔽行爲之動人言論，實無足注意」。在這折衝的一幕之中，假定日方原來以爲若此滔滔雄辯，必然娓娓動聽，則其所獲亳不客氣的直　反應是「眞沒價値，無足注意」，折衡失敗了；惟有松岡的外交辭令，完了篇，交了卷，完全沒有什麽意外的打岔而沒有失敗。</p>
<p>雖然，當前的國際演變，終究不是舞台戲劇而是偉大歷史；以松岡居彼職位而發此言辭，終究不是丑角打諢而是負責表示。他所說「日本必不被迫而遠離已定之方針」，「願見中國之糾紛與歐洲之戰事速吿終止，而不再有任何國參加之」，「日本今後將忠於其軸心國之同盟國，日本外交政策將來決以三國盟約爲樞軸」，「中國之命運，在日本人觀之，有關日本帝國之生存」，表明了日本的剛愎，說明了日本決不放棄其兼倂中國的政策，且不容他國顧問中日問題；其有關世界者，則表示必黨德義，凡此數點，自是日本一貫的態度，事屬早已有目共覩，松岡這一次的演說，誠然，並無絲亳新的提示，新的意義；然在美國再三申述其堅定的遠東政策之後，其已開始實行推進其政策之時，美國朝野殆以爲對日業經行使壓力，並以爲如此程度的壓力必有實效，而松岡代表日本政府所說明者，如此如此；則吾們正不應因松岡演說沒有新提示，沒有新意義，而以爲不値重加注意。尤其在美國朝野，必須體認明白，松岡所說雖無新提示與心意義，却正是對於美國近頃各種措施的嶄新答覆。美國對此明白的新答復，不但應該重加注意，且該對於今日以前的美國各種措施，以及所規畫於今後採取的各種方案與步驟，必如之何始會發生實效，實屬亟須重加考慮！誠如昨日紐約所傳，「美國遠東問題專家均以爲除非日本改變政策，以外交方法解決時局之希望實甚微小；惟渠等同時並信欲求日本改變政策，希望尤渺」；然則美國若不拋棄自己的政策而屈從日本的政策，必須根本袪除依持外交萬一有靈的意念，從速實現有力有效的行動，遠東與太平洋庶幾有淸澄之望。</p>

<p>自凟後之性能衰退</p>
<p>之害，在本刋已一再闡述，但每天接到討論手淫之防止方法者，函如雪片飛來，故足證犯者之普遍。但照身體的健康而論，成人之犯手淫，其弊害遠較兒童為少。第一，因成年人，諗知手淫之害，常加一致，非至情不為禁，而不為之，在兒童則反是。第二，即射精一次，亦不若兒童時，一滴精液，即為其發育身體之精華者，故兒童手淫，除其精神，筋力，德，智等方面齊受損害外，仍以阻碍身體之發育為最烈。蓋兒童年少識淺，既不認手淫為惡習，復不克脫啟羈絆以自拔，故雖勺滴精液排洩，即其生命能力之喪失，而身體遂受有價值之斵傷。簡言之，即手淫常致兒童整個之身體腦於無用，在成年人其損害常限於智力與道德方面。就手淫者心理上之兩點觀察之，可知致其嗣後人格之沒落，道德之淪喪者，其　結有二：（一）為自羞（二）為自暴。所謂自羞者，即手淫者每自知其所做不當，行為可恥，故常秘不吿人；然淸夜自思，每立志自誓，以絕此卑汚之惡習。惜乎其意志薄弱，而環境之試誘强大，故而一犯再犯，竟不克擺脫手淫之羈絆。為時既久，則良心之感覺麻醉，亦不再感內中之責備，體格與精神，俱變為衰弱不振。所謂自暴者，因其衷心長存羞恥觀念，漸致其人性情暴戾，離羣索居，屏絕社交。此外最引為悲慘者，就是因手淫之摧殘，遺精頻繁是也。</p>
<p>人類之生命。繫於精血之繁榮，患遺精者，適背道而馳，故有神經衰弱，腦弱失眠，發育不全，腎虧陰萎等症爆發，症狀至此，實不宜自誤，必須淸心寡慾，嚴守攝生，從事高尙之遊戲，力導思想於正軌，勿閱讀邪淫書籍，然後可將手淫戒絕。並於睡前服以「耐而斯遺精片」三片，則不論任何頻繁之遺精，及凶恶之滑精，藥到病除。萬一遺精已久，身體必須培補健康，則積極服以睾丸精質製劑男用「補體康」具有解除神經衰弱，促進發育之神效。</p>

<p>— 德國醫學博士　王克春</p>
<p>淋病之治療法，近頃因科舉進步，其治法大有改進，譬如本要施行手術者，可以不用手術之療治之，本來需要注射藥者，而今竟有內服藥在許多所可以代之。如淋病治療即其一例。</p>
<p>自留德研究將學，垂六七年，而於淋病之治療，尤素喜探索；久思對旅一切淋病，在某種塲所，可以避免注射，而代以內服之藥劑；嗣幸德國彼德博士發明之淋病特效藥一克淋儂一一藥始符吾人之期望；因「克淋儂」一藥，係用特製最新化學製劑，其殺菌功效，能於服後最短期內發生。其殺菌範疇，不僅限於局部，而是彌漫於有淋菌蹤跡所在之處；故其功效，與打針注射之藥，絕無二致。而服此藥無註射打針之痛苦，堪淋藥中獨一無二之內服劑。凡一切急慢性白濁，如攝　腺炎，睾丸炎，關節炎，前後尿道炎，女子陰門炎，陰道炎，子宮炎卵巢炎淋毒性白帶等，服「克淋儂」，均有短期內根治之效，而省去許多打針之痛苦與麻煩；且其功效遠超過一般之針藥，故余於十數年來，在許多乞余醫治時之淋病患者，懇求免去打針而以丙服藥代之，則恒推薦「克淋儂」一藥，均能在短期中獲根本治愈之功績。至於外用不用「抗淋水」在家按圖與說明書洗滌尿道，以淸除粘膜上之淋菌，則奏效更速，與「克淋儂」同時服用，尤有珠聯璧合之妙。</p>

<p>淋病失治之險症</p>
<p>吾人大抵與有淋毒之異性接觸後，在一星期左右，淋病之症狀，必至出現。由發病後之兩三星期中皆稱為急性期，如能急謀適當之治療，最易根治，過此即入慢性期矣。慢性淋表面上之痛苦，雖不若以前之甚，而實際上之危險，遠過於急性期間。如－旦成為慢性攝護腺炎，睾丸炎，精囊炎，或精系炎等，則不僅個人受其痛苦，且往往因此絕嗣，而伉儷之情，亦由此而破產矣？</p>
<p>據余過去之經騐，關於失治後之慢性淋，其治療的方法及手術，較急性時為繁，余對此症，切淋病聖藥最新化學療法製劑為內服劑，俾增進抗淋噬菌的效能，而以德國靜電療法，使殺菌力直達病灶，更輔用科學手術，儘可在短期內完成根治之任務，並可絕對不致再發，因為淋菌既已絕迹，自不虞其死灰復燃也　兼治梅毒橫痃下疳性神經衰弱等症診時上午十時至下午六時每天送診廿號每號僅取號金五角</p>

<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>咳嗽一症，似乎人人都有這個經騐，但有許多原因的咳嗽。却並不容易治好。嗽聲不絕，或乾咳無痰，或咯痰不爽，或乾多如絮，或痰中混血，總之咳嗽不治，將來甚為危險，中國人十九有肺病潛伏，平時因抵抗力强大，所以四面包圍結核菌，但抵抗力往往為咳嗽而消失，此結核菌即突圍而出，如虎出柙。肆行無忌。故咳嗽之後，繼之以癆病，尤為恒見之事。為防咳嗽趨於惡化起見，不得不速根治咳嗽，「補肺拿爾」一藥，確為鎭咳除痰的惟一特效藥。不論二三期肺病，無不應手而愈，久為中外肺病專家所稱許。</p>

<p>雖然淪爲孤島後的上海、環境比較惡劣、空氣異常窒息、但是、反得盡情享樂的機會，一般人的生活、且竟已超過戰前的狀態、娛樂塲所之畸形發展、舞廳劇塲之特殊繁榮、準會使剛從內地而踏進孤島的人們、發出驚異的感覺、而興天堂地獄之慨、</p>

<p>再隔三犬，便是一九四零年的聖誕節了。儘管戈林的飛機在英倫上面吼着，卸貨似的拋擲炸彈；上海的米價貴到一百又零，幾乎可把米粒串起來當珍珠圈看待；可是萬民騰歡，無分畛域底「快樂聖誕」，終於站在我們的眼前了。</p>
<p>除了報紙上的禮物廣告，花色繁多，說不勝說；穿着鑲皮紅袍子，笑臉相迎，臃腫而叉充滿活氣的聖誕老人，還是千年如一旦，毫無變更之外，混統的說一聲，聖誕樹或象牙紅之類，其中却着實有些分別。因爲這些聖誕節的裝飾植物，正像我們過新年時的，「歲朝淸供」，天竹臘梅之類，這裹亦頗有出入。我們正不妨趁此談上一談，以爲渡佳節的先聲哩。</p>
<p>做聖誕樹的植物，均大都是松柏一類，我們這裏常看到的有兩種：普通擺着賣的，是松樹，葉子像尖刀一樣，很刺手的，它是我國用途最廣的木材植物，可以建造房屋，橋樑，製造器具，還可做鐵路的枕木和飛機的材料，公司裏賣的叫檜，葉子像刺，但嫩葉好像柏，所以俗叫刺柏，街上賣的松樹都是臨時插起來的，檜却是有根的整桿，所以賣得很貴，這兩種樹，本來都是很高大的。</p>
<p>紅葉像花的植物和聖誕老人的頭畫在一起的，叫做猩猩木，我國叫它一品紅，（俗名象牙紅）枝頂有許多瓶樣的東西，每一個瓶裏，　許多花，每一朶花只有一個花蕊，瓶外有個小凹，是密槽，猩猩木就靠這蜜槽和紅葉來引誘昆蟲，替它媒介花粉。</p>
<p>葉子生刺帶鮮紅果子的植物，常和鈴子縛在一起的，叫做枸骨葉冬靑，是一種冬靑，因爲葉子和一種叫做一枸骨」的木犀很像，所以有這個名字，街上沒有賣，法國公園的板橋邊却有栽着的，枸骨葉冬靑在歐洲很多，葉子可做銅料，木材可製器具。</p>
<p>另外有一種　寄生，是枝葉很密的常綠植物，根生在大樹裏，吸收水養分，所以是寄生的，外國聖誕節時常用它做裝飾，在我們這裏却不很普通，偶然在花攤上也可以看到的，枸骨葉冬靑和　寄生的果子，對人類都很有毒，我們不可以去嘗。</p>
<p>這時候，國產的花攤裏擺臘梅呀，水仙呀，楊柳芽呀，風信子（洋水仙）呀，萬年靑呀，時常看見一種萬年靑的樹，上面生一個扁而大的紅果子，其實這紅果子是刺葉香椒的果實，賣花人把它穿上去的。（毓鏞）</p>

<h3 id="c94">觀戰事新聞片 <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— 葉巷悠</p>
<p>在黑暗中坐了兩小時又一刻鐘，看完了德國大使館招待各界參觀的戰事新聞片。</p>
<p>全片差不多都是用炸彈與砲彈所結晶成的，爆裂聲與烟火，焚燒是這張片子的『配音』和『照明』的重要工作，也是觀衆的主要享受。</p>
<p>一件値得欽佩的，是他們攝影記者的有系統的工作。攝影的角度取材，表現的方法，剪接的適宜，都使我們　這些工作人員表示佩服的，但一想到把這些文明的工具，不用於表現文明的進步上，而用之於誇揚破壞，我覺得也許這世界是瘋狂了。</p>
<p>出得門來，寒風刺骨，但那轟炸火燒，等等，還在腦中活躍，使人想到我們自己也在經歷着的『文明』的賜與的現實。同時，也警覺到，這些宣傳，這些『佳片』都似乎也在向我們伸出乞『同情之手』似的。</p>
<p>然而我搖頭了！</p>
<p>家庭</p>
<h3 id="c95">嫂嫂 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— 宜因</p>
<p>以我的地位來寫嫂嫂，哥哥或許會說我是怠氣用事吧？因為我們以前是那樣的「假」，但我始終對這老實而痴情的哥哥寄以無限的同情！</p>
<p>嫂嫂是曾受普通敎育，新舊思想二兼的女子，她信佛敎，一個月得吃幾回經，同時她又是個愛虛榮而拜金主義者，這是很多可以證明的。</p>
<p>自從她跟哥哥結婚後，家裏是熱鬧多了，但一切不幸的煩惱也從每人心裏顯露出來了，好像有個可怕的惡魔在捉我們，我們都逃避着它，而極力尋我們的快樂，這是一種責任觀念似的。</p>
<p>最先她僅發發脾氣而已，後來她的物質慾望愈過愈大了，哥哥的能力終於漸漸失收下去。</p>
<p>哥哥實行了給她　學校，給她學了中文打字，她說她在娘家手帕都不洗的，她要獻身社會，不久她做了女打字員，而得「進賬」是說明貼補她娘家用的。媽說她竟是「孝女」，哥哥由此敬重了她，由敬重而懼怕是一個理由吧！</p>
<p>這時該是她最走紅的時候！打扮得相當出風頭，同她的上司坐了汽車時出，並請一班同事來家打牌，出去看戲，她說她為了職業得應酬人家，她說哥哥沒有手段，不懂交際。</p>
<p>她是變了，討厭哥哥，說他是無能為她告訴我們她是悔恨她的「出嫁」，她竟嫁這麼個無資產的人，同時她覺得見過「大世面」了，不休讚美着那些出色的洋屋，漂亮的汽車，美麗的花園。她磨折哥哥；當她生氣時，她叫哥哥做一切僕人所做的事以自娛。假若哥哥有意跟她「搗蛋」，她就哭着罵着，隨手把東西拋到地上算才够「出氣」，媽媽有時去勸勸，她往往給以難堪的答詞：「你看你的兒子好了，我吃得消他的刁嗎？」哥哥是惟悴了，而那奕奕有神的眼睛，是變得那麼憂鬱而失望，他痛苦的忍耐着，他要這不可理解的太太懂得他的愛情，而這樣謙遜，屈服的態度，換得親友輩的一些譏嘲。家庭裏每一顆心，是浸潤在被騷擾得不安寗的氣　衷。</p>
<p>爸爸就叫他們去另外組織小家庭，但不久，他們仍舊搬回來住，理由是不够開支，老換衣僕，東西給人拿了無人能好好照管。媽媽答應了他們。這時嫂嫂「有喜」了，但她認定她自己有病，非得請　不可。這又得淘氣，藥不　咧，不是名醫咧！又說她丈夫希望她早死，總之，她依舊和哥哥意見紛歧而個性變化不已，媽天天忙着侍候她吃這吃那，而我們是這麼容易會觸犯了她，甚至和哥哥說句話，她也疑心是「攻擊」她。不久，她在醫院　生了小孩，她不信媽媽的經騐之談，她信自己新法育兒，在那寒冷的冬天，她必須叫奶媽大天給孩子洗溫水浴。孩子得了感冒而轉警厥，於是不救而亡。孩子的死，給哥哥是個痛心的打擊，而嫂嫂更浪漫起來了，她往往在外一二天不回家，在夜裏，哥哥獨自坐着發呆，他在等門，汽車啦叭聲響了，打門聲起了，他去開門，他不笑也不氣。家裏每人睡得真甜，我是醒了。我覺得哥哥脫離不了一種束縛，他已經很疲倦。</p>
<p>戰爭的砲火，把我們都分開了，她與哥哥到了漢口，我們——父母弟妹則輾轉到了上海</p>
<p>離別會叫人發着感歎的音語，哥哥的來信，顯得他更寂寞無聊，一面他關覺悟的說嫂嫂脾氣怪，哥哥是很想减去我們對她的壞影響，而為她穩藏着不說甚麼。</p>
<p>有一天，我們接着哥哥的信，這信便我猜想哥哥是用着多麼深刻的痛苦而包含着憤怒與嚴肅的重重感情寫的呀，而媽媽是流下了淚。</p>
<p>他說他化了上午的時間，獨自在公園裏想，他想演一幕慘案，想把她：他看了手裏的手槍，他望着藍色的天，想到速隔千里愛他的父母，他向天悔罪了！決不這麼做，免得父母傷心。原來嫂嫂騙他是回娘家，而與一個臭銅錢的男子同居，倒底拋棄了愛她的丈夫。</p>
<p>他們就這麼在一個律師事務所簽字離了婚。</p>
<p>哥哥說那黃鶴樓將是他永遠不會忘記的一個地方，在他回憶裏，他們曾經一次最後的遊玩，哥哥於是吃醉了酒離開這個鎭市。</p>
<p>我默默祈禱，願哥哥為國為家，負起使命，建立一個幸福光明的未來家庭。</p>

<p>— 顧明道</p>
<p>此時美少年冷笑一聲道：「向聞吾公賢名，但不通在風塵中辨識人物，豈得稱天下名士？吾見幾盲了。」說完道話，佛袖而出。一逕　至難家院柳如是妝閣裏，去下儒巾，脫却外衣，竟是美人化身，那裏來的許幻？便是柳如是自己易釵而弁，故　到陳臥子家中去試探眞意的。絳子走進房來問道：「姊姊方纔去看陳臥子，他可曾識破你的廬山眞面？姊姊試探他，他怎樣回答呢？」柳如是嘆了一口氣說道：「陳臥子枉是有名，他不通通在風塵中辨識人物，怎配種天下名士呢？徒負我一片深情，眞是懊惱。」絳子道：「姊姊何用懊惱，陳臥子這般木强無情，姊姊何必戀戀於他？以姊姊的才貌無　，傾倒你的人何止百數，他日何患不得美朗君而事……。」絳子再要說下去時，柳如是把纖指在伊羞着道：「妹妹年紀輕輕，說什麼郎君不郎君？絳子笑了一笑，去到伊自己房中去讀書。柳如是獨自坐着支頤默思，十分無聊。忽然錢牧　又來了，帶着幾件高貴的物品，贈送與柳如是。親自將花挿在柳如是鬢上，掉着斯文語句道：「將花比卿，卿美十倍於花。」遂文取過紙筆，作了四首　花詩，都是五律，香艷絕倫，聲　鏗鏘。柳如是一時高興，也作了一詩答謝錢意。錢輕撫伊的香肩說道：「絳仙才調女相如，卿之謂也。」這天晚上錢牧齊又在如是妝閣中宴客，衆名士都至，祗有陳臥子和張天如不到，陳臥子當然不會來的。至於張天如是因見錢牧齊頗有眷憐柳意，而柳如是前日答復他的一詩，明明是流水無情，意興十分蘭珊，所以他也托病不來了。錢牧齊在松陵留連六日，差不多天天　柳如是處。月儕中也都知道其意，頗欲玉成此事，只不知如是心中怎樣，可要嫌牧齊年老？牧齊臨去時，柳如是堅約後期。錢筆齊答以三月。他歸到虞山紅豆山莊後，便將自己多年寶藏的兩顆紅豆，用錦拿貯着，又作了十首紅豆詩，特遺專足送至松陵，表示他愛慕之意。柳如是接到後，也將伊自己一塊錦帕，題了一首詩，送給牧齊，幷候書論文。所以牧齊和柳如是常有詩東往來，柳如是是好名慕才的人，伊旣不欲嫁張天如，對於陳臥子親自試情，有效期了一次壁，幾乎不使伊意冷心灰。恰巧遇見名重大江南北詩詞，班香宋艷，鮑俊庾清，非羣子所可頡頗，足稱　壇祭酒，所以伊的芳心不能無動了。經過一個相慕相愛的時期，有表人終成眷屬，柳如是許嫁發牧齊了。（十六）</p>

<p>英茵從重慶跑到上海，差不多玩兒了牛年多，才拍了一部「賽金花」；這部戲除了劇本與導演比較差一點之外，她個人的演技，是頗爲精湛的。可是道以後，爲了合衆公司在「可辦」與「可不辦」的啞迷中，雖然新華和藝華都曾與她一度接洽過，而她動過「歸去」之念，也是事實；這就是英茵要回重慶的消息的由來。然而，照這兩天的發展情形看來，英茵也許不致回重慶去的，假使英茵和合衆的合同關係眞的斷絕的話，她可能於最短時間內，與另一家影片公司簽訂長期合同。最顯明的事實是：他因爲原來居住於桃源邨的房屋不適合，已在另覓新居，預備喬遷，這正說明了英茵有在滬作「久住之計」。另一方面，她還將在上海演一下舞台劇，新藝劇社和上海劇藝社都和她有過口頭的默契，大致在明年春天，可能在舞台上漏一下臉的。「重慶之行」看來將作爲罷論了</p>

<p>Manila, United Press - Reliable sources here revealed today that the strength of the US Asiatic Fleet will be enhanced within 48 hours, providing it with a complete cruiser fleet. The USS Cincinnati, sister ship to the USS Marblehead, will sail to Manila within 48 hours to permanently join the Asiatic Fleet. At that time, the US Asiatic Fleet will have unprecedented strength. The fleet has recently greatly increased its submarines and long-range patrol bombers. The significant strengthening of the US Asiatic Fleet under the command of Admiral Hart coincides with the recent substantial increase in US ground forces on the Philippine Islands. The US combat strength here has been enhanced by maintaining an unprecedentedly strong air force. More important plans will soon follow. The new cruiser fleet of the Asiatic Fleet will include the USS Houston (Admiral Hart's flagship), the USS Marblehead, and the USS Cincinnati. The USS Houston only recently replaced the USS Augusta, which has sailed back to the US for inspection. Before the Pacific crisis, the USS Marblehead repeatedly sailed to Shanghai and once joined the Asiatic Fleet. (20th United Press dispatch)</p>

<p>US Public Opinion Expresses Views: Matsuoka's Remarks Like Throwing a Bomb</p>
<p>Washington - The remarks made yesterday in the Far East by US Ambassador to Japan Grew, Foreign Minister Matsuoka, and newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to the US Nomura are considered by local affairs researchers to be very direct and beneficial. However, the opinions of these three men did not indicate any significant changes in the basic policies between the two countries. Ambassador Grew stood up and spoke after Matsuoka Yosuke, attacking several points of the foreign minister's stated policies. Americans considered this no different from throwing a bomb at a farewell party. At that time, Grew said, "Let us criticize everyone, whether they are nations or individuals, as follows: 'You can see what kind of person they are from what they do.'" He also said that Matsuoka Yosuke's statement that "the fate of China, at most, only concerns the feelings of Americans, but for Japan, it concerns the existence of the empire" was wrong. The US ambassador further stated that he had to express the falsity of the Japanese foreign minister's words, "I also note the foreign minister's words regarding 'Japan has never closed its doors anywhere to anyone' and that Japan has no intention of conquering or oppressing others." Ambassador Grew also stated that Matsuoka knows "Americans value only facts and actions, not their appearance." Matsuoka had previously frankly admitted that US-Japan relations had become strained, but patience and prudence might save the two countries from disaster. Therefore, it is believed here that the use of Ambassador Grew's speech yesterday offers little hope of resolving the situation, only that both countries are willing to avoid war. Unofficial informed sources said that the United States does not want to start a war but wants to firmly protect its own interests. If Japan takes further action, the United States will also fulfill its obligations. The State Department spokesman said that he was not yet able to criticize the Tokyo speech. (20th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Asahi Shimbun said in an editorial today that Foreign Minister Matsuoka's decision to appoint Nomura as the ambassador to the United States was based on the belief that if the United States understood Japan's true intentions, all current US-Japan tensions could be resolved. Therefore, Nomura's mission to the United States is Japan's final attempt to seek US understanding and its last move to adjust US-Japan relations. The Nichinichi Shimbun editorial advised the United States to reconsider its Far East policy, saying that Matsuoka believes the fundamental reason for the deterioration of US-Japan relations is the United States' misunderstanding of the purpose and aspirations of Japan's handling of the China incident. This explanation of the situation is correct. If we may speak frankly, we cannot help but suspect that the Roosevelt administration is deliberately attempting to contain Japan's aims. Japan's political efforts are limited to areas that are vital to Japan's survival and do not involve other places. If mutual understanding is sought to seek local peace, the whole world can abide by peace. Japan is establishing a new order in East Asia, just as the United States wants to work for security and peace in the Western Hemisphere. (20th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Japan Continues to Undermine US Interests: Implements Embargo, Aids China and Britain</p>
<p>Washington - Yesterday afternoon, all US newspapers disclosed the remarks of US Ambassador to Japan Grew and Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka. The words of the two sides differed from each other, showing how different the views of the countries they represent are and how vast the gaps that the new Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Nomura, will have to bridge when he arrives in Washington. It is felt here that Grew is still, as he was in October 1939, expressing his great theories with the demeanor of a statesman, while Matsuoka still shows a misunderstanding of the extent of American concern about Far East events. Matsuoka's statement that current events clearly force him to admit that US-Japan relations are greatly strained is generally agreed upon here. However, Matsuoka's statement that the reason for the tension stems from the United States' apprehension of Japan's aims and desires is not endorsed. Everyone here feels that Japan's purpose is clearly understood by the United States, that is, Japan's goal is to seize hegemony in Asia and Oceania. According to Grew, in October 1939, he clearly stated to the Japanese that the American people attach great importance to the actions of Japanese troops in China interfering with and undermining American rights and interests in violation of treaties and agreements. However, the Japanese side never attempted to improve the situation after hearing this warning, and the situation has worsened. Matsuoka's words can be regarded as beautiful, but those who hear them still do not understand why the US concern for Atlantic security is also Japan's concern. Some say that examining Matsuoka's words, it seems that Japan is worried that it will have to go against its original intention and implement its Axis treaty with Germany. Therefore, please do not break the peace in the Pacific. His words are truly an appeal for Japan to avoid an unfortunate fate. At the same time, some people say that Matsuoka's words are intended to paint a picture of the US threatening Japan with a surging momentum, but the reality is that Japan's aggressive policy has already undermined US interests and now wants to continue. Grew's statement that actions speak louder than words refers to Matsuoka's statement that Japan does not want to close its doors to others anywhere. The general reaction here is that</p>

<p>Hong Kong - Tokyo dispatch: The new Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Oshima Hiroshi, held his investiture ceremony in the Imperial Palace this afternoon. (20th dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Japanese Emperor appointed General Oshima as the Ambassador to Germany this morning. The previous ambassador, Lai , was a career diplomat who succeeded Oshima as envoy to Germany last year. Japanese officials have not yet announced Oshima's departure date. It is expected that he will travel to Berlin via Siberia in the near future. Oshima served as a military attache in Germany for a long time and actively worked to promote German-Japanese friendly relations. (20th Huitong News Agency dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e3">This is Japan's New Answer to the United States <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>The US-Japan Society held a farewell banquet in Tokyo the day before yesterday for Japan's new ambassador to the United States, Nomura. During the event, US Ambassador to Japan Grew and Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka each gave speeches. The main points of their speeches were published in yesterday's newspapers. Anyone who cares about international affairs will surely understand that this kind of occasion is not a boring social gathering, that this kind of announcement is not a casual chat over drinks, and that this kind of debate is not an emotional outburst, but is in fact the most serious and important expression outside of formal negotiations.</p>
<p>Diplomatic personnel have various different styles, and the skill of diplomatic language often differs greatly. It is imagined that Matsuoka must be a great liar whose face will never turn red. He can know that sophistry is not enough to convince people, but still have the courage to speak eloquently. Seeking his kind of style in the diplomatic circles of the past and present is not uncommon, so it is not particularly hateful. He is only a diplomatic personnel, not a major politician who consciously bears responsibility for success or failure. Therefore, it is commendable that he uses this kind of "believe it or not, success or failure is up to him" basic concept as a yardstick for measuring his diplomatic language. He said: Under the new order of Japan's plan, there is absolutely no conquest, no oppression, and no self-interested exploitation. He also said that Japan's political power should be limited to the scope that is of utmost importance to Japan, "and should not be extended to the borders of other peoples." He also said that Japan "is now engaged in a moral crusade, and is now striving to begin a new era of lasting peace and unlimited prosperity in Greater East Asia based on fairness, justice, and mutual benefit." He seems to be trying his best to declare and is willing to guarantee that in the past and even now, north of the Yalu River and west of the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea, there is really and truly, clearly and plainly, absolutely no Japanese soldier. If an American or anyone else says there are, then that is "slander," that is, "a deliberate misunderstanding." Saying things like this, who else has the courage to correct him, and what need is there for debate? Perhaps US Ambassador Grew is clumsy in diplomatic language! He simply replied: "What is truly valuable is facts and actions, as for moving words that conceal actions, they are not worth paying attention to." In this scene of negotiation, assuming that the Japanese side originally thought that such eloquent and eloquent speech would surely be pleasant to listen to, then the straightforward reaction they received was "really worthless and not worth paying attention to," and the negotiation failed. Only Matsuoka's diplomatic language was completed, the paper was handed in, and there were no unexpected interruptions and no failure.</p>
<p>Although, the current international evolution is ultimately not a stage play but a great history. For Matsuoka to hold his position and say these words is ultimately not a clownish joke but a responsible expression. What he said, "Japan will not be forced to deviate from its established course," "wishes to see the disputes in China and the war in Europe end quickly, and that no other country will participate in it," "Japan will continue to be loyal to its Axis allies, and Japan's future foreign policy will be based on the Tripartite Pact," and "the fate of China, in the view of the Japanese, is related to the survival of the Japanese Empire," shows Japan's stubbornness and explains that Japan will never abandon its policy of annexing China and will not allow other countries to advise on the Sino-Japanese issue. As for the world, it means that it must side with Germany and Italy. All these points are Japan's consistent attitude, and they have long been seen. Matsuoka's speech this time, indeed, has no new suggestions or new meanings. However, after the United States repeatedly stated its firm Far East policy and when it has begun to implement and promote its policy, the United States, both the government and the public, almost believe that they have already exerted pressure on Japan, and believe that such a degree of pressure will be effective. What Matsuoka said on behalf of the Japanese government is such and such. Then we should not think that it is not worth paying attention to because Matsuoka's speech has no new suggestions and no new meanings. Especially in the United States, both the government and the public must clearly realize that what Matsuoka said, although there are no new suggestions or new meanings, is precisely a brand-new answer to the various measures taken by the United States recently. The United States should not only pay close attention to this clear new answer, but also must seriously consider how the various measures of the United States before today, as well as the various plans and steps planned to be taken in the future, will be effective! As reported yesterday in New York, "Far East experts in the United States all believe that unless Japan changes its policy, the hope of resolving the situation through diplomatic means is very slim; however, they also believe that the hope of seeking Japan to change its policy is even more渺茫." But if the United States does not abandon its own policy and succumb to Japan's policy, it must fundamentally eliminate the idea of relying on the slight chance of diplomacy working and quickly implement powerful and effective actions, and the Far East and the Pacific will hopefully be cleared.</p>
<p>US President Circumvents Johnson Act: Increases Financial Aid to Britain</p>
<p>The seriousness of the Far East situation is exactly what Japan wants to create. US newspapers are still calling for expanding the export licensing system to control exports to Japan. The Washington Star reported that large quantities of automobile tires were being shipped to Japan, Manchuria, and the Axis countries, and advocated that the export licensing system currently applied to steel, gasoline, etc. should be further expanded so that the US policy of assisting China and Britain can be effective. (20th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington - US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau said yesterday that he will not sign any new order contracts with Britain before the next Congress examines President Roosevelt's recent proposal to aid Britain (namely, increasing military production for Britain to use on loan). Political figures mostly believe that the purpose of this move is to circumvent the Johnson Act. British Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Phillips recently informed Morgenthau that Britain has expressed the need for US financial aid to continue the war of resistance. The procurement committee has also submitted a material procurement plan worth 3 billion US dollars to the Treasury Department, including 1.2 billion US dollars to purchase 12,000 fighter planes, 1 billion US dollars to purchase 60 new cargo ships, and 1.7 billion US dollars to purchase artillery-equipped tanks and cannons. As for the 60 merchant ships, the British side has paid a deposit of 50 million US dollars. Officials explained that this batch of 60 cargo ships is only a preliminary step and will be expanded to double in the future. President Roosevelt held a meeting at the White House yesterday with Secretary of War Stimson, Secretary of the Navy Knox, and other experts to devise a plan to increase national defense production, which will establish a new National Defense Committee, with the current Chairman of the National Defense Committee Knudsen, plus Secretary of War Stimson and Secretary of the Navy Knox, as the main personnel. The committee will have full authority to stimulate production. (20th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt's cabinet will meet today to formulate a procedure to speed up the production of military supplies needed by the US and Britain. Roosevelt originally scheduled a meeting today with several members of the Defense Advisory Committee, and perhaps had already scheduled a joint discussion today with Secretary of War Stimson and Secretary of the Navy Knox. After the discussion, a new plan for accelerating US defense procedures may be announced. President's Secretary O'Leary said last night that there are four or five suggestions currently being considered by the US government, one of which is to establish a Supreme National Defense Committee, whose members include Secretary of War Stimson, Secretary of the Navy Knox, and Chairman of the National Defense Committee Knudsen.

It is said that the delegation will include experts in various military weapons, paying attention to all aspects of the development of modern warfare. This kind of committee is the first of its kind since the last war. At that time, a group of experts, led by Lieutenant Generals Tsukushi and Wada, went to the Western Front for inspection. The results made great contributions to the improvement of the Japanese army's equipment and weapons. (20th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Tokyo - The US Embassy and its motor house were pelted with excrement again today. The troublemaker was an elderly Japanese man. Police described him as mentally deranged.

The suspect fantasized about "fulfilling a heavenly wireless order." The US Embassy immediately notified the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Matsuoka and the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs have sent personnel to apologize. Now that the perpetrator has been caught, the number of police guarding the US Embassy has been reduced, as the embassy requested strict protection after the incident on December 2nd.

The previous communique stated that everything was very quiet on the border, while this one stated that fierce fighting had broken out on the Thai-Vietnamese border on Wednesday. There were three places on the northeast and southeast borders where the fighting was very fierce. That day, French troops fired on Long Kai (transliteration) with machine guns for an hour, and Thai troops returned fire. At 5:50 PM that afternoon, the French artillery of Thai Ke fired sixteen shots at Lakhon Pha Long (transliteration), and Thai artillery also returned fire, destroying the French artillery's gun emplacement and setting it on fire.

<p>Hanoi - Well-informed business sources said yesterday that the British ban on goods being shipped to Vietnam has been extended to Australian dairy products. Although these dairy products can be purchased in northern Vietnam, Saigon has lacked these goods for several weeks. It is expected that the entire territory of Vietnam will also suffer from a shortage of these goods in the future. The French, who are fond of cheese and butter, are now very unhappy. The Japanese side is also affected by this embargo, as Britain has banned the shipment of British cotton and Indian jute, which is necessary for manufacturing rice bags, to Vietnam, causing a shortage of rice bags needed by the Japanese to ship rice to Japan. Many French merchants have expressed their willingness to restore commercial relations with the British Empire and have strongly argued that trade between Britain and Vietnam does not affect the outcome of the European war. Among British people, many also hope to restore trade. Some people even hinted that the British blockade policy may be lifted soon. (20th United Press dispatch)</p>

<p>Chongqing - This morning, Ta Kung Pao published an article advocating the unification of political and military power. It stated that since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, all Chinese people, regardless of their party affiliation, have wanted to unite and resist Japan. All parties have publicly declared their support for the central government's program of resistance and national reconstruction, implementation of the Three Principles of the People, and support for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's leadership. Therefore, the focus of today's problem is not just political unity, but more importantly, the unification of military power. In addition to strictly observing discipline and obeying the orders of the commander-in-chief, this is not only required of the army of one country, but also of the allied forces of several countries. If the military is not unified, it cannot fight, and it cannot even maintain the independence and freedom of a country. Therefore, today, if an army does not obey the orders of the commander-in-chief or even engages in irregular activities, we can only sigh and must regard such actions as detrimental to the effort of resistance and national reconstruction, and even endanger national security. Unity can be applied to political issues, but in the military, there is only discipline and orders. Today, all armies participating in the resistance and national reconstruction are part of the Chinese National Army, with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek as the supreme commander. For example, the Eighth Route Army, at the beginning of the war, announced its loyalty to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and reorganized to become part of the National Army, so it must obey the orders of the supreme commander. This is not only the duty of all soldiers, but also the desire of the people of the whole country. The article concludes that the army belongs to the country, not to a party. Although the Kuomintang holds political power today, the army does not belong to the Kuomintang, but to the National Government, under the command of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. China will eventually establish a constitutional government, and the Kuomintang cannot use the army for any political action. Although the article does not specify which army is disobeying orders, it clearly refers to the Eighth Route Army, which was recently ordered by the commander-in-chief to move to a certain location, but has not yet departed. It is said that the reason is that it needs sufficient time to arrange the transfer. At the same time, according to sources here, the supreme commander is now very determined, ordering the army to comply with the transfer order. (20th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e19">Chinese Side Seeks to Restore Green Tea Exports <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing - The Chinese authorities are now seeking to restore green tea trade with French Morocco and other parts of North Africa. French Morocco annually purchases 21 to 22 million pounds of Chinese green tea, accounting for half of China's annual green tea exports. Since the defeat of France and the British blockade of the coast of French Morocco, this green tea trade has come to a halt. According to people in the Chinese tea industry, green tea sold to French Morocco is not suitable for sale in the European market, so it will not be transshipped to Germany.

<p>Chongqing - Since the promotion of the thrift and national construction savings movement, it has been very smooth. Generally, the achievements in various places can exceed the pre-determined savings amount. For example, the pre-determined amount for Chongqing City is 16 million yuan, and now it is 13 million yuan. It is also planned to launch a savings promotion campaign during the New Year, with the goal of saving 2 million yuan in three days. In addition, the Ministry of Communications savings promotion team performed Peking Opera on the 16th and 17th, using the purchase of savings bonds as tickets, resulting in 260,000 yuan, which is said to be an unprecedented record.

<p>Xi'an - The Shaanxi-Henan Office of the Trade Commission believes that wool is a major product of the Northwest and one of the main foreign trades during the war. In addition to Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces, Shaanxi province also produces a large amount of wool. However, because the methods of raising sheep in various places mostly follow the old methods, no attention has been paid to the improvement of sheep breeds, the improvement of wool quality, the prevention of sheep diseases, and the shearing of wool, resulting in no increase in wool production in recent years. Therefore, according to central regulations, 150,000 yuan has been allocated to hire animal husbandry experts to engage in improvement, promote scientific methods, protect sheep breeds, and expand animal husbandry areas, so that wool production in Shaanxi province will gradually increase. Concrete plans have also been formulated and are now being actively implemented. (19th dispatch)</p>

<p>London - During a question and answer session in the House of Commons yesterday, Member of Parliament Morgan suggested that, in view of the extreme importance of British commerce, the Colonial Secretary should discuss with the Myanmar government the possibility of at least preparing to build a railway roadbed from Lashio to the Myanmar border, so as to connect with the Chinese railway leading to Yunnan. Colonial Secretary Emery replied that he knew that although the Chinese authorities had completed the surveying of the railway leading to the Myanmar border, the construction work on the Chinese side was still hundreds of miles away from the Myanmar border. The engineering work on the Myanmar side is not only the roadbed, but also more than a hundred miles of mountainous terrain that must be excavated by engineers before it can pass. In addition, a large bridge of more than 500 feet in length must be built over the Salween River. However, the various difficulties involved in the China-Myanmar railway issue are currently being considered. (20th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Cairo - The last coastal road to Tobruk for the Italian forces in Bardia was cut off last night by British mobile units. Two Italian divisions, totaling 30,000 men, are reportedly completely trapped in the encirclement of Bardia. British officials say that the main base of the Italian Air Force in Libya, the Benina airfield, has been virtually destroyed by the British Air Force, so the power of the British counterattack against Italian North Africa has increased. Bardia and its fortified suburbs have become a large trap due to incessant bombardment from the sea and air, trapping the Italian rearguard who are fighting to the death. It is said here that since the British army advanced to the Mediterranean Sea to cut off all escape routes for the Italian army, the iron fist of the British army has been gradually tightening. (20th International dispatch)</p>
<p>Cairo - It is estimated here that most of the two Italian divisions in the western desert were surrounded by British forces in Bardia last night. The British side is using trucks to transport infantry to reinforce, so the strength of the British forces surrounding the Bardia Italian base is becoming stronger. British advance mobile units appear to have cut off the road from Bardia along the coast to Tobruk, but this has not yet been confirmed. The Italian garrison in Bardia is currently resisting stubbornly and is making skillful use of the terrain. At night, a British battleship fiercely bombarded Bardia. Enemy torpedo boats attacked the British battleship but failed and were driven back. On the same night, naval aircraft flew to the port of Tripoli and dropped four tons of bombs. Three bombs hit supply ships, warehouses, and depots, causing heavy damage and violent explosions. The British side lost one Swordfish aircraft in this battle. The bulletin also carried the details of the sinking of the Italian submarine "Naiade" on December 14 and the joint bombardment of Bardia by the Navy and Naval Aviation on December 15. It concluded that throughout the battle, the Naval Aviation Corps and the British Air Force cooperated with the naval bombardment ships and were very successful. The Navy is currently continuing to assist the Army in its operations. (20th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Rieti's Brief Biography</p>
<p>Helsinki - The new Finnish President Rieti was born in 1889. His term of office is six years. While in school, Mr. Rieti studied law and graduated. After that, he worked as a judge, and then entered politics. Soon after, he entered the business world and took over an export company. When Finland gained independence after World War I, Mr. Rieti devoted himself to political activities. From 1919 to 1924, and from 1927 to 1929, according to a neutral observer in Berlin, Hitler refused to contact Petain directly, and all negotiations had to go through the hands of Achsen. The German demands included the passage of German troops to the Mediterranean Sea, the use of the Toulon naval base, the French Navy, and the French merchant fleet. It is said that Laval's attempt to persuade Petain to go to Paris was to make him accept this plan. Few observers here doubt that Hitler is about to launch some kind of sudden action. As the British Prime Minister said yesterday, Hitler will soon take action, no matter what, it will not be within the next two months. (20th Reuters dispatch)</p>

The current problem of the French government is to find a way to correct the bad situation encountered by the French nation due to the armistice agreement, and then improve the people's livelihood and promote economic recovery. Otherwise, all transformation work is equivalent to empty talk. As for the Franco-German cooperation policy, it is the hope of France's future. If the future peace treaty does not aim at effective and lasting cooperation between the two major nations of France and Germany within their respective political and economic spheres, then no matter when the belligerent countries cease fighting and make peace, there will be no true meaning.

<p>British Navy and Air Force Cooperate in Battle, Fiercely Bombarding Italian Coastal Bases</p>
<p>Cairo - The Italian airfield in Benina, near Benghazi, an important Italian base on the Libyan coast, was subjected to a rare and fierce attack by British aircraft on Tuesday night in the western desert war. According to a British Air Force bulletin released last night, British aircraft dropped many tons of bombs when attacking the Benina airfield, and the aircraft and buildings in the airfield were heavily damaged. The British aircraft attacked in batches. The first batch of aircraft dropped bombs and immediately caused a fire. The aircraft that arrived later bombed fiercely, and the fire became more intense. Explosions were heard incessantly. At least 16 Italian aircraft were destroyed. When the last British aircraft flew away, the area had become a large fire pit, and the entire aircraft was shrouded in thick smoke. British aircraft also bombed the road from Bardia to Tobruk, but it was not possible to know the bombing results in detail. British fighters continued to patrol and cooperate with the British army on the ground. In addition, the Rhodesian British Air Force attacked the enemy airfield and troops in the Midanma area. Other British aircraft bombed Jabal Serro Batti, 30 miles northeast of Qassala in the Sudan area. All aircraft returned safely, except for one British aircraft that attacked the port of Valona in Albania. (20th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London - The Admiralty issued a bulletin last night describing the British Navy's assistance to the Army and Air Force in the battle in Libya. The Navy's activities began on the night of December 8. On that night, British ships and aircraft bombed Makdila with great success, destroying enemy camps. On December 10, the entire enemy army retreated, and the British Navy also participated in harassing the Italian army. On that night and the 11th, they shelled the Italian columns on the road near Solon. During the important period from 1:00 am on the 11th to 1:00 am on the 12th, British ships bombarded Solon and the hillside road, which proved effective. British ships fired continuously, and when the enemy troops abandoned their vehicles and fled, they fiercely bombarded them with long-range Maxim automatic rapid-fire guns, the so-called "pom-pom" guns. Although British ships were bombarded by coastal artillery batteries, none were hit. On December 12, several British ships braved strong westerly winds to carry out the important task of supporting the British vanguard and carried back captured Italian troops. They were crushed on the 13th. After our army bombarded them continuously, they captured some new highlands. It is reported that the Greek army also achieved a major victory in the mountainous area north of Pogradetz and is advancing towards Elbasan. In the coastal area, they are advancing towards Palerma, which was recently captured by the Italian army. A special correspondent from the United Press reported from the Greek troops in the central area that the battles of Tepeleni and Klysyri have reached their final stages. News from the front line to Struga in Yugoslavia is that Greek troops have reached a certain stronghold 10 kilometers north of Klysyri. Another stronghold only 2 kilometers north of Klysyri was repelled by Italian reinforcements after several hours of fierce fighting by Greek troops. (20th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Athens - According to unconfirmed reports, Greek troops have recaptured Palerma, and the Italian army has fled to Gjirokastra. (20th International dispatch)</p>
<p>Athens - Last night it was reported that Greek troops had crossed the snow-covered mountain passes in the central and southern war zones of Albania and had broken through the Italian army's new defense line and reached the outskirts of Tepeleni. It is said that after the Greek troops forced the Italian army to retreat from Klysyri, they arrived in Tepeleni. It is believed that the fall of Klysyri and the inability of the Italian army to stop the Greek army from advancing to Tepeleni may foreshadow the early collapse of the Italian army on the Adriatic Sea to the central front.

<p>Vichy: Several divisions of German troops have arrived in Italy, which was confirmed last night by authoritative sources here. (Although this news first circulated in the capitals of Yugoslavia and Hungary, its confirmation by sources close to the Germans is a first.) The French side is unwilling to disclose the number of German troops in Italy, but it is generally believed that the number of German troops is not far from the previously cited figure of 50,000. It is confirmed that a portion of Nazi troops is already undertaking patrol duties in Italy, while other German troops are preparing to embark for Albania and Libya to assist the Italian troops fighting in those two places. The same sources also believe that this development proves that the two Italian campaigns are very unfavorable.

However, the same sources do not attach importance to the news that thousands of German troops have already arrived in Italy, calling such news "deceptive propaganda." However, the British newspapers today still insist that a large number of German troops have gone to Italy, and that Führer Hitler will, after all, begin to rescue Mussolini from the African trap. Officials pointed out that German Propaganda Minister Goebbels is in the Yugoslav capital, managing a large-scale propaganda bureau. This kind of news comes from the capital of the said country. It is widely believed that Hitler deliberately spread this rumor in order to support Italy's prestige and attract more British troops to Libya, and then send troops from France via Spain to attack Gibraltar.

<p>London: Prime Minister Churchill warned the nation in a speech in the House of Commons yesterday that Germany may carry out an invasion of Britain in the middle of winter, but coastal defenses have been established from southern Scotland around the entire island, and a large army is also ready to deal with the invaders. (Associated Press dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>London: British Prime Minister Churchill stated in the House of Commons yesterday afternoon that the British army now has a very strong land force that can be rapidly deployed to any location and launch a very strong counterattack. Therefore, everyone should believe that if the enemy army actually sets foot on British soil, the British army will be able to defeat it. However, Hitler is using his vast power with cruel means, and this is what everyone must remember. But if anyone compares Hitler to Napoleon, I will object, because I do not wish to insult the deceased. Churchill continued to speak about the British air force's battles, saying that the German attempt to prevent British planes from attacking has failed, so British planes have been flying freely in German airspace, inflicting very heavy blows. German planes' night raids on Britain have also failed, but we must expect the German side to continue to carry out such air raids. As for the continued sinking of British ships in the Atlantic, although the number is not as high as in 1917, it is not insignificant, and this is quite disturbing. We must admit that the danger that seemed to have been subdued a year ago has now resurfaced. From now on, we will rapidly increase resources and other defense methods. The important task at present is to keep this path to the world open, to resist the submarines and long-range aircraft that are attacking this path. We have stood firm to this day. Many of our friendliest countries overseas were disappointed in our ability to continue the war, but that period has passed, and we are still able to continue to progress. This is gratifying. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that in the past few days, Germany's war efforts seem to have temporarily ceased. This is a moment of calm before the storm. We must wait and see what happens. There are things that cannot be ignored. Germany has been fighting with its greatest strength for fifteen and a half months. Five countries have been devastated by it, and Romania and Slovakia have been occupied. In the air, Germany has maintained day and night attacks almost without ceasing, but the intensity and duration of the air raids have decreased recently. This is probably due to bad weather. Germany's pressure at sea has slightly increased, but the activities of the German navy are limited to the movements of submarines and torpedo boat squadrons and the occasional sniper attacks by raiding ships. In the diplomatic sphere, the visits of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to other countries and the enticement of politicians from various countries to Germany have been greatly reduced. German propaganda no longer speaks of major and astonishing events that are about to happen. The background of the fall from grace of Laval, the former Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the French government, is also kept silent, which shows a glimpse of their predicament. When German newspapers mention Italy, they often use sympathetic phrases to describe the Italian army's excellent ability to recover, but apart from earnestly stating the unity of the Axis powers, all newspapers advocate providing active assistance. British Prime Minister Churchill said in the House of Commons yesterday that Hitler had waited a long time before launching a terrible attack and crushing France. Therefore, during this period of temporary silence, Britain is deeply aware of the need to constantly increase its efforts. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>

<h3 id="e39">British House of Commons Holds Debate on Tangier Issue; Butler Says Strong Protest Lodged Against Spain's Actions Violating International Treaties <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>London: During a debate in the British House of Commons yesterday on the situation in the Tangier international zone, Labour MP Kirk stated that the situation in Tangier is quite serious, so the United Kingdom should take stern steps to preserve the neutrality and unfortified nature of Tangier. Butler discussed the developments in Tangier in resolute terms, including the dissolution of the international administrative organ, stating that after Spain continued to take sudden action on December 13, the British Consul General in Tangier and the British Ambassador both made representations to the Tangier authorities and the Spanish Ambassador and the Spanish government in Madrid in very definite terms. What we are eager to know is what practical effect the general guarantees obtained by the British community there on December 1 have. We are also concerned about the future of British officials in the administrative organs. After Tangier fell into the hands of the Spanish authorities, not only British officials were treated this way, but also officials of other nationalities, mostly French or Italian, all received the same treatment. Regarding the 1,700 people of the British community in Tangier, we have received some guarantees. Regarding the British officials, we are currently in negotiations and have lodged strong and appropriate representations. The signatories to the Tangier Act are France, Spain, Great Britain, and Italy. The subsidiary signatories are the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, and Sweden. I cannot speak for Italy and France, but I have heard that the Netherlands and Belgium have joined the United Kingdom in protesting against this action by Spain. At the same time, we have notified the governments of Portugal and Sweden of the actions that the United Kingdom is currently taking. The United States is well aware of the situation in Tangier and has been in contact with the United Kingdom. The British government has ordered the British Consul General in Tangier to immediately go to Madrid to assist British Ambassador to Spain Sir Hoare in discussions with the Spanish government. This shows how much the British government values the discussions that are currently underway. The British government's consistent policy is to encourage Spain to adopt an independent policy. Although the British enemy is carrying out vigorous propaganda and taking actions that create false impressions of the British government's attitude, the British government will not change the above policy. If the Spanish people make appropriate preparations, the country can achieve independence, because Spain must understand that its recent actions in Tangier and other places will inevitably affect the hearts of the British people. We especially recognize Spain's position in Tangier, but since we are a signatory to the international agreement, we not only have the right but also the responsibility to demand respect for the provisions of the agreement and the legitimate rights of the British community. Independent Spanish and British governments should cooperate with each other, which would obviously be beneficial to both parties, but this cooperation clearly depends on the preparations of both parties for this.

<h3 id="e40">Financial Speculators Resell in the Afternoon; Foreign Exchange Positions Remain Abundant <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>In the foreign exchange market yesterday, HSBC's listed prices tightened again. The pound sterling was re-listed at 3 1/2 pence and the U.S. dollar was re-listed at 5.5625 yuan, each falling by 0.0125. Other currencies such as the Dutch guilder, Luxembourg franc, and Japanese yen all uniformly tightened to varying degrees. As for the domestic market situation, it was still shrouded in rumors at the beginning. It was said that a certain bank would open for business, so there was an action to take in foreign exchange and gold in the market. The general speculators also followed suit in buying, and it was heard that many had turned bullish, causing the U.S. dollar to fall to 5.625 yuan. Because HSBC briefly came in with fewer offers and there were reports of a U.S.-Japan conflict, the tightening temporarily eased slightly. Unexpectedly, the bank soon reaped profits and absorbed them, and it tended to weaken again at noon. In the afternoon, it was reported that the United States was strengthening its Far East fleet, and it was reported that the banking sector in the city had requested the central government to maintain the U.S. dollar at 5.625 yuan. Banks were willing to close positions, speculators disappeared, and instead, outsiders sold, with abundant positions. Therefore, the underlying trend suddenly turned bullish. The outside market for the current month's U.S. dollar was 5.75 yuan. By the evening close, it had returned to flat. As a result, the pound sterling was still squeezed down, while the U.S. dollar was unaffected, with closing prices of 3 5/8125 pence for the pound sterling and 5.71875 yuan for the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>HSBC's Listed Prices Tighten Again</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the London exchange rate, both near and far term, rose by 0.0625. The New York silver price was flat, and the London gold price remained unchanged. The exchange rate of the pound sterling against the U.S. dollar and Shanghai remained unchanged, the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling did not change, the exchange rate against Shanghai was up by one cent, and there was no market for the exchange rate against the French franc. The central bank's listed prices for various currencies remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling price was 3 5/9375 pence for the pound sterling and 5.6875 yuan for the U.S. dollar. Compared with the evening close on the previous day, the pound sterling and the U.S. dollar had each tightened by 0.015625 and 0.03125 respectively. At the same time, the futures market opened with a uniform tightening. After the opening, speculators first came to close positions, and the market became more brisk. It was estimated that the outside bank gave 5.65625 yuan for the next month's U.S. dollar. At that time, Standard Chartered Bank and HSBC were willing to sell, and the trend slowed slightly. It was estimated that the outside bank absorbed the current month's U.S. dollar from HSBC at 5.65625 yuan. HSBC's listed prices were announced and tightened again. The pound sterling was re-listed at 3 1/2 pence, and the U.S. dollar was re-listed at 5.5625 yuan. Other currencies all tightened. The silver balancing tax was announced to increase by 0.50%. After that, the outside bank sold back and HSBC resumed taking in, and the market rebounded slightly. It was estimated that the current month's U.S. dollar was traded at 5.6875 yuan. However, after 11 o'clock, Chinese merchants and speculators came to the market to buy heavily, with little supply for a large demand, and the price became more and more weak. It was estimated that speculators closed into the outside bank for the next month at 5.625 yuan. The noon close for the spot U.S. dollar was 5.65625 yuan, and the pound sterling was 3 5/78125 pence, with the pound sterling and the U.S. dollar each tightening by 0.015625 and 0.03125 compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>Buy Orders Decrease Greatly in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The market turned bullish in the afternoon. It was heard that merchants had no intention of entering, and only Sassoon had a slight appetite. However, the outside banks supplied offers, and the price loosened. It was estimated that the outside bank sold the next month's U.S. dollar to Sassoon for 5.71875 yuan, and that the subsequent demand was even less. The outside bank's selling positions were very strong, so they continued to loosen. The outside market once made a transaction for the current month's Heavenly Exchange at 5.75 yuan, but it softened again in the evening. It was estimated that the spot and current month's U.S. dollar was 5.71875 yuan, the pound sterling was 3 5/78125 pence, the next month's U.S. dollar was 5.6875 yuan, and the pound sterling was 3 5/625 pence, with the U.S. dollar flat and the pound sterling down by 0.03125 compared to the closing price on the previous day.</p>

<h3 id="e41">Gold Market Rises and then Shows Signs of Retreat; Highest at 6190 Yuan <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market in the open and black markets first rose and then suddenly fell. It rose close to the 6,200 yuan mark several times, and then once retreated into the 6,100 yuan range. People's hearts were still shrouded in various rumors and news, and it changed from firm to weak. Initially, due to the endless rumors on the previous day, gold shops, silver shops, and exchange merchants were inclined to enter, and retail investors and securities firms scrambled to buy, and the price rose step by step from the morning opening of 6,110 yuan to 6,190 yuan. When rumors of a conflict between the United States and Japan were heard, silver shops and exchange merchants resold, and the rise stopped and hovered. In the afternoon, with news that the United States was strengthening its Far East fleet, securities firms and gold shops resold, and retail investors sold out. The foreign exchange rate also reported a bullish trend, and the price then retreated sharply to 6,075 yuan. Finally, it rose slightly, closing at 6,110 yuan, a gain of 20 yuan. The total transaction was more than 10,000 taels. There was still no cash transaction, and the price was 32-3 yuan lower than the term transaction. The swap was also not made, with a discount of more than 30 yuan. Ornaments were highest at 630 yuan, and finally at 625 yuan, a gain of 5 yuan. Guan gold and others remained flat.</p>
<p>Open Market Only Rises by 20 Yuan</p>
<p>Early in the morning, because it was heard outside the market after the evening close on the previous day that it had reached 6,120 yuan, gold shops made a transaction for 20 taels at 6,110 yuan. Subsequently, it was reported that the foreign exchange rate continued to contract, and there were more orders to enter than to exit, and the price went up again. It was estimated that the gold shop entered 20 taels for the securities firm at 6,160 yuan. After a slight decrease, a small money shop sold 20 taels to the gold shop at 6,140 yuan. At that time, the HSBC foreign exchange listing showed a contraction, and the long positions of gold shops and firms were strong, and they intensely searched for purchases, pushing it close to the 200 yuan mark. It was estimated that the gold shop entered 20 taels for the silver shop, reaching 6,190 yuan. Around 11 o'clock, the foreign exchange rate rebounded, and securities firms and gold shops released their positions, and it was pressed down by 50-60 yuan. It was estimated that the gold shop exited 20 taels for the silver shop, dropping to 6,130 yuan. Later, silver shop firms dredged again, and the exchange rate was soft again, and the buying enthusiasm was universal. Securities firms entered gold shops again, rising to 6,190 yuan. At the noon close, gold shops exited 20 taels for the silver shop at 6,165 yuan. The afternoon opening price was the same as the noon close price. It was estimated that the gold shop entered 30 taels for the silver shop at 6,165 yuan. Retail investors bought it and started at 20 yuan higher. It was estimated that the silver shop entered 20 taels for the gold shop at 6,180 yuan. However, with the exchange rate bullish, exchange merchants were the first to release their positions, and a certain gold shop also released its position, and it fell. It was estimated that the securities firm exited 20 taels for the silver shop at 6,135 yuan. Later, it was raised to 6,150 yuan, but the exchange market was still weak, and securities firms and others also came to sell, and they could not support it, pressing it within the 100 yuan mark. It was estimated that the silver shop exited 20 taels for the gold shop at 6,075 yuan. Before the close, a certain gold shop absorbed it slightly, returning it outside the 100 yuan mark. It was estimated that the securities firm entered 20 taels for the silver shop at 6,120 yuan. The gold shops made a transaction for 20 taels at the closing, and the noon was 6,110 yuan. As a result, it rose by 20 yuan compared to the closing price on the previous day. The entire day's fluctuations were 115 yuan. The cash shop's own brand gold selling price was 15 yuan lower than the open market, and the closing gold was 50 yuan lower. The current standard gold was 50-60 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little trading.</p>
<p>Ornament Gold Listed 5 Yuan Higher</p>
<p>The price of jewelry gold per tael sold by silver shops was 10 yuan higher at 9:45 am and fell back 5 yuan at 3:30 pm. It was estimated that Datong Hang was listed at 625 yuan, and the price of New Tonghang was similar to the above price, with the purchase price about 30 yuan lower.</p>
<p>U.S. Dollar First Tightens then Loosens</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: the open market price rose sharply and retreated slightly. The pound sterling and U.S. dollar also rose and then retreated slightly, and finally rose by 5 cents. The supply of pound sterling notes was slightly strong, and the evening market retreated to 49 yuan. The U.S. dollar note once rose to 17 yuan and 66 cents. Later, due to rumors that conflict between Japan and the United States was unavoidable, the supply from all parties suddenly became strong, and the evening market retreated to 17 yuan and 43 cents, falling by 7 cents compared to the previous day. The demand for Hong Kong notes has not decreased, and the evening market continued to rise to 4 yuan and 13 cents. The Japanese gold note rose after falling, and finally rose by 5 mills, with the evening market at 1 yuan and 58 cents. The supply and demand for Korean notes was even, and the evening market remained at the original price of 1 yuan and 32 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Food: Rice Hoarding, Central Gate Rice Sold at a Limited Price <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice nominally maintained a limited price, but the situation was tighter than before. For example, Wuhu pointed rice, which was not subject to a limited price, was sold at 79 yuan, an increase of more than 1 yuan, while other miscellaneous brands of Central Gate rice were sold at prices in line with the genuine brands. All the rice on the market was locked in warehouses by hoarders. Rice shops actually had no goods to sell to the public, so they had to purchase secondary goods to fill the shop, so the miscellaneous brand goods market suddenly became prosperous, able to compete with the genuine brands. It was estimated that the closing market price for Central Gate No. 1 was 87 yuan, 86 yuan and 4 cents, No. 2 was 81 yuan and 5 cents, second was 80 yuan and 8 cents, fire twist was 86 yuan, second was 83 yuan and 5 cents, No. 2 Siamese was 80 yuan, Pudong warehouse second was 78 yuan and 5 cents, small twist was 79 yuan, 78 yuan and 5 cents, rice green was 79 yuan, broken was 76 yuan and 5 cents, second was 72-3 yuan, Tokyo granite point was 76 yuan and 5 cents, 76 yuan, Wuhu point was 79 yuan. The current food situation in Shanghai is that there is no real attention and responsible management, so it is controlled by rice merchants and hoarders. If hoarders are not dealt with, it is difficult to expect rice prices to fall. Because there is no limited price for returned original packages, the January No. 2 Saigon was from 87 yuan, 87 yuan and 5 cents to 88 yuan, 2 yuan higher than the previous day's low price of 86 yuan. The small twist for December initially opened at 92 yuan and then went to 92 yuan and 5 cents, 1 and a half yuan higher than the previous day's 91 yuan. The rest were 1-2 yuan higher. The total transaction of spot goods was again as high as 10,000 bags, and there were also 600 tons of term goods.</p>
<p>The supply of thick and thin glutinous rice and other domestic rice is still intermittent, so the owners' minds have turned firm, and the sales market has been in line with the firm and tight foreign rice and the remainder of yesterday's sell-off. The shop appetite is also smoother, so the selling price has recovered by several yuan. The opening price for Kunshan rice was 99 yuan to 96 yuan and 5 cents for white glutinous rice, and the special price was still 101 yuan. The opening price for green corner thin rice was 89 yuan, 87 yuan and 5 cents, and the original package was 92 yuan.</p>
<p>The outflow of glutinous rice also turned prosperous yesterday. Not only did rice carriers adopt a lot, but also breweries took action, and the selling price followed the other goods and generally increased by half a yuan to nearly one yuan. It was estimated that Chen Yuan was sold at 95-6 yuan, the Hong Kong special group grain was 85 yuan, the long grain was 83-4 yuan, and the second was 81 yuan.</p>
<p>The source of foreign rice is very prosperous. The Taikoo Company's Jiangsu shipping transported 1,104 bags from Hong Kong, which arrived in the morning and stopped at the company's pier on the Bund in the French Concession to unload. Jardine Matheson's Dingsheng shipping also transported 1,987 yuan from Hong Kong, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and stopped at the Roosevelt Pier to unload. It was heard that Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng ship also loaded more than 9,000 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, which can arrive today. The Detada ship directly transported a large amount of foreign rice from Saigon and can arrive in Shanghai within the year. With such a prosperous source of foreign rice, rice prices should not be high, but the selling price of Central Gate rice is at its highest, and it is seeing its daily increase. Today, there are 3,000 bags of rice to be transported to Weihaiwei and 3,500 bags to Yantai. (Zu)</p>
<h3 id="e43">Although Foreign Flour Arrives, It Still Cannot Curb the Rise <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, foreign flour was still considered stable, because after a huge amount of foreign flour arrived, people's hearts were not without softening. However, most of the arrived goods were ordered by the firms in the street. In view of the current lack of wheat raw materials and the insufficient supply of Chinese flour, coupled with the impact of yesterday's tightening of exchange rates and the sharp rise in the gold market, most of them stood guard and were unwilling to sell lightly. A part of the customers who were eager to ship were still absorbing it continuously. The total sales of flower god, beautiful, flower and bird, and clock tower brands were 13,000 to 14,000 bags. The price of flower god and beautiful was 21 yuan and 5-6 cents, and the price of flower, bird, and clock tower was 21 yuan and 3 cents.</p>
<p>Foreign flour arrived in Shanghai again yesterday. The Taikoo Company's Jiangsu shipping arrived in Zhang yesterday from Hong Kong, loading 2,500 bags of flour. (Zu)</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, it was rare and brisk, because the Chinese factories repeatedly released prices to absorb it. The price of Gao Du wheat was opened at 32 yuan, and the daily factory's market price for receiving was also released to 30 yuan, but there was still a lack of the entire amount to receive. It was heard that the Sanxin Factory was negotiating with grain merchants for a batch of term wheat, and they were still talking about the price. The Chinese factory also plans to order foreign wheat to provide assistance.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Securities: Public Bonds Slightly Soft, Foreign Stocks Continue to Rise <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The unofficial market for public bonds was weak again yesterday, with trading volume also reduced. Hongda and Shunchang still saw considerable buying, and Sihao and Shihsihhao, Fu, etc. also had buying interest. Changji bought about 100,000, and Wuhao bought 960,000, but market prices could not be raised. Runli, Lemao, Shengchan, Yichang, Runli Tongsheng, Xieda and Xie Kang all had selling activity. The market was generally stable amid uncertainty. Prices generally fell back by a small amount, between two and four and a half jiao. The total transaction volume was estimated at 1.34 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading: 500 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity shares were traded at a price of 8 yuan and 6 jiao.</p>
<p>Public industrial stocks continued to rise, with new high prices repeatedly emerging. Public confidence was restored, and short sellers rushed to cover their positions. Yangzi, British and Federal Association, Jardine Matheson, and beer and steel companies saw particularly intense price increases. Almost every industrial stock had a large volume of transactions. The prices of various well-known rubber stocks also rose sharply, with large transaction volumes.</p>
<p>Due to telegraphic disruptions, London stock and bond market prices have not been received for the past two days.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Yarn and Cotton: More Cotton Yarn Imported than Exported, Shuang Ma Reaches 1363 Yuan <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to advance, mainly due to the sharp decline in foreign exchange rates, the rise in gold prices, and enthusiastic sentiment. Buying remained strong, so "foreign traders" were consistently unwilling to give up importing. However, no actual transactions developed, so some in the industry became more indifferent and sold off. However, those with strong capital absorbed the volume steadily. According to market sources, "foreign traders" were still importing more than they were exporting. Today, 35 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Shuang Ma opened in the morning with prices jumping 10 yuan higher than the previous day, reaching 1357-8 yuan, because of the big drop in exchange rates in the afternoon of the previous day. The sentiment was mostly inclined to purchase. As soon as this price opened, buyers on the floor rushed in, directly pushing the price up to 1362 yuan. Soon after, there was news that the foreign exchange rate decline had eased slightly, and at the same time, it was heard that current yarn merchants still did not have large sales, leading to long positions being closed. The market situation changed from tight to weak, falling back to 1351 yuan. As soon as the low price appeared, both short covering and position-reversing buyers advanced side by side, and the price rose again to 1363 yuan. Those who profited along the way sold off again, causing another drop to 1354 yuan. Subsequently, the price hovered around 1356-7 yuan for a long time. The closing price was 1356 yuan. It was found that the total volume of transactions in half a day was 5,820 bales. The price of 20-count Shuang Ma yarn rose by 13 yuan. The amounts bought by various yarn shops are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Same trade: 5,600, Ningbo: 35, Hong Kong: 160, Mainland: 5, Tianjin: 20, Total: 5,820</p>
<p>In the afternoon yarn market, 20-count Shuang Ma initially rose to 1360 yuan, then traded at 1354 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Cotton Market: Sentiment Leans Towards Stability <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The spot cotton situation is stable, with nothing particularly exciting to report. Generally, sentiment leans towards stability, and the factory's demand has not seen wholesale development. However, the yarn market is solid, and the source of supply remains difficult, so the future is hard to predict.</p>
<p>Another report: Foreign cotton market prices in the New York cotton market were mixed. Early gains were due to spot merchants buying to cover short positions, but these were later offset by speculative selling. As a result, closing prices fell by 1-2 points compared to the previous day. India fell another rupee yesterday, including forecasts.</p>
<p>Trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been quiet again in recent days. Although factories have a strong intention to purchase, no large-scale purchases have been seen. However, industry sentiment remains very high, especially for long-staple cotton, because Tianjin merchants are exploring purchasing this type of raw cotton in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Rises Sharply, Momentum is Very Strong <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The factory cloth market rose sharply yesterday, mainly due to East Piece Goods continuing to reach new highs. Locally produced goods were still cheaper, attracting avid buying from both within and outside the industry. Selling was therefore stimulated. Fine cloth rose by 5 jiao to 1 yuan, and fine twill and coarse cloth rose by 2.5 jiao to 5 jiao. Bleached and dyed cloth rose by 5 jiao. Transactions on this street were over 1,000 pieces of various cloths. The Zhejiang Road, Wenzhou, and Ningbo merchants bought over 200 pieces of fine cloth and canvas. The Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants bought over 300 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth, coarse cloth, and plain fabric. The North Road, Yantai, and Tianjin merchants bought over 200 pieces of plain fabric, coarse cloth, and colored cloth. Today, 100 pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Yantai, 80 pieces to Tianjin, and 30 pieces to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The price of East Piece Goods continued to rise sharply, with wild increases and decreases throughout the day, and large fluctuations. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth opened in the morning at 38 yuan 8-9 jiao. Opening prices rose with the gold standard, and traders were enthusiastic. The highest price rose to 39 yuan 6-7 jiao. Some who profited sold off, bringing the price back down to within 39 yuan, but the results still favored positive sentiment from all sides. Industry sentiment was high, and prices trended upward again, closing at 39 yuan 2 jiao. Sijunzi serge was around 1 yuan 1 jiao 7 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Oil Market: Crude Oil Rises Another Yuan Plus <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's oil market initially showed weak sentiment in the morning due to the sluggish closing prices of the previous day, so sentiment remained depressed. Soybean oil prices fell by about one yuan. Crude oil prices were supported by rising production prices and low inventory levels, so the overall situation remained stable. In the afternoon, soybean prices remained firm due to export inquiries, and the Qingdao oil market continued to report frequent increases, causing the soybean oil market to stabilize. Crude oil continued to rise by more than one yuan. 300 pieces of Jiaozhou crude oil were traded at a price of 87.5 yuan to 88 yuan, and another 200 pieces of new goods were traded at a price of 89 yuan and 90 yuan. 500 cans of Yantai canned crude oil were traded at a price of 118.5 yuan. 50 barrels of Qingdao crude oil were traded at a price of 121 yuan to 21.5 yuan. 50 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil were traded at a price of 79.5 yuan. 50 pieces of Yantai Qixian soybean oil were traded at a price of 82 yuan. 500 dan of Dayouyu factory soybean oil were traded at a price of 91 yuan to 92 yuan. 400 dan of Pudong Japanese factory soybean oil were traded at a price of 88 yuan. 500 dan of Rihua factory soybean oil were traded at a price of 89 yuan. 100 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were traded at a price of 111.5 yuan to 11 yuan.

<p>— American Medical Doctor Huang Zhongchang</p>
<p>The harm of performance degradation after masturbation</p>
<p>has been repeatedly explained in this publication, but every day we receive letters discussing methods of preventing masturbation, like snowflakes, which proves the prevalence of the offense. But in terms of physical health, the harm of masturbation committed by adults is far less than that committed by children. First, because adults know the harm of masturbation, they often add consistency, and do not abstain until they have no choice, while children are the opposite. Second, even one ejaculation is not as important as a drop of sperm in childhood, which is the essence of their developing body. Therefore, childhood masturbation, in addition to damaging their spirit, strength, morality, and intelligence, is most harmful because it hinders the development of the body. Because children are young and ignorant, they neither recognize masturbation as a bad habit nor can they break free from the shackles to extricate themselves. Therefore, even a drop of sperm being discharged is a loss of their life force, and the body suffers valuable injury. In short, masturbation often renders the entire body and brain of children useless, while in adults, the damage is often limited to intelligence and morality. Two observations from the psychology of masturbators show that there are two ties that lead to the decline of their personality and the loss of morality: (1) self-shame (2) self-abandonment. The so-called self-shame means that masturbators always know that what they are doing is inappropriate and their behavior is shameful, so they often keep it secret from others; however, when thinking alone at night, they often make vows to stop this base and filthy bad habit. Unfortunately, their willpower is weak, and the temptation of the environment is strong, so they repeatedly commit the act, and cannot break free from the shackles of masturbation. As time goes by, the feeling of conscience is anesthetized, and they no longer feel internal blame, and their physique and spirit become weak and depressed. The so-called self-abandonment is because they have a sense of shame in their hearts, which gradually leads to their violent temperament, living in isolation, and avoiding social interaction. In addition, the most tragic thing is that frequent nocturnal emission is caused by the destruction of masturbation.</p>
<p>Human life. is tied to the prosperity of sperm and blood. Those who suffer from nocturnal emission are running in the opposite direction, so symptoms such as neurasthenia, brain weakness, insomnia, incomplete development, and kidney deficiency and impotence erupt. At this point, it is not appropriate to delay, you must clear your heart and reduce your desires, strictly observe health preservation, engage in noble games, and guide your thoughts to the right track, do not read obscene books, and then you can quit masturbation. Also, take three "Nair's Nocturnal Emission Pills" before going to bed, and no matter how frequent the nocturnal emission, or the vicious spermatorrhea, the medicine will cure the disease. If nocturnal emission has been going on for a long time, the body must be nourished and healthy, then actively take the testicular essence preparation for men "Buti Kang", which has the magical effect of relieving neurasthenia and promoting development.</p>

<p>— German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting</p>
<p>Patient Qian ××, 26 years old, from Hankou. (Self-complaint) - At the age of sixteen, he had an affair with a maidservant, who was five years older than him, and who was naturally lewd and no longer a virgin. After being seduced, he learned about the relationship between man and woman. Whenever he had the opportunity, he would secretly meet with her. After a year, the maidservant was betrothed to someone by her mother. He committed masturbation because he was young and ignorant. He was originally healthy, but after this lewdness, he often had symptoms such as dizziness, forgetfulness, and insomnia. In the winter of his eighteenth year, he entered married life again. His wife was beautiful, and he was greedy for sex again, causing his body to be injured beyond repair, and everything fell into decline. He begged to be cured. (Symptoms at the time of diagnosis) - Tinnitus, night sweats, insomnia, forgetfulness, pale complexion, skinny, weight 103 pounds. He also had nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, and loss of appetite. (Healing Progress) - Qian Jun's condition was quite deep. Without making him reduce his desires, the treatment would not be successful. Therefore, in addition to instructing him to preserve his health, he was given electrotherapy, and a large amount of testicular essence preparation for men "Buti Kang" was given to make the endocrine glands prosperous, so as to nourish the losses and promote the function of new metabolism. At the same time, he was given "Nair's Nocturnal Emission Pills" to consolidate the sperm barrier and stop nocturnal emission. After a month, the nocturnal emission had stopped, so he stopped taking "Nair's Nocturnal Emission Pills" and electrotherapy. After taking "Buti Kang" for another month, he was cured.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Discussion on Oral and Injectable Drugs for Leukorrhea <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— German Medical Doctor Wang Kechun</p>
<p>The treatment of gonorrhea has been greatly improved in recent years due to the progress of medicine. For example, those who originally needed surgery can be treated without surgery, and those who originally needed injections can now be replaced by oral drugs in many cases. The treatment of gonorrhea is one such example.</p>
<p>I have been studying in Germany for six or seven years, and I have always been keen to explore the treatment of gonorrhea. I have been thinking for a long time that for all kinds of gonorrhea, in some places, injections can be avoided and replaced with oral drugs. Fortunately, German Dr. Peter invented the special gonorrhea drug "Kelimunong", which met my expectations. Because "Kelimunong" is a special new chemical preparation, its bactericidal effect can occur in the shortest time after taking it. Its bactericidal scope is not limited to the local area, but permeates the entire area where gonococci are present. Therefore, its effect is no different from that of injections. Taking this medicine has no pain of injections, and it is the only oral drug in gonorrhea medicine. All acute and chronic leukorrhea, such as prostatitis, orchitis, seminal vesiculitis, spermatic cord inflammation, anterior and posterior urethritis, female vulvitis, vaginitis, uterine inflammation, oophoritis, gonorrheal leukorrhea, etc., taking "Kelimunong" can be cured in a short period of time, saving a lot of injection pain and trouble; and its effect far exceeds that of general injection drugs. Therefore, for more than ten years, I have always recommended "Kelimunong" to many gonorrhea patients who begged me to avoid injections and replace them with oral drugs. All of them have achieved the merit of fundamental cure in a short period of time. As for external use, using "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" at home to wash the urethra according to the diagram and instructions to clear the gonococci on the mucous membrane, the effect is even faster. Taking it at the same time as "Kelimunong" is especially wonderful.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Gonorrhea Lecture <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Doctor Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>The Dangerous Symptoms of Untreated Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Generally, about a week after contact with a member of the opposite sex with gonorrhea toxin, symptoms of gonorrhea will appear. The two or three weeks after the onset of the disease are called the acute phase. If appropriate treatment can be sought urgently, it is easiest to cure. After this, it enters the chronic phase. Although the pain of chronic gonorrhea on the surface is not as severe as before, the actual danger is far greater than during the acute phase. If it becomes chronic prostatitis, orchitis, seminal vesiculitis, or spermatic cord inflammation, etc., not only will the individual suffer its pain, but it will often lead to infertility, and the relationship between husband and wife will also be bankrupt because of this.</p>
<p>According to my past experience, the treatment methods and surgery for chronic gonorrhea after neglect are more complicated than those in the acute phase. I use the latest chemical therapy preparation of gonorrhea holy medicine as an oral medicine to increase the effectiveness of anti-gonorrhea phagocytes, and use German static electricity therapy to make the bactericidal power directly reach the lesion. I also use scientific surgery to complete the task of radical cure in a short period of time, and it can be guaranteed that it will never happen again, because the gonococci have disappeared, so there is no need to worry about their resurgence. It also treats syphilis, inguinal lymphogranuloma, chancroid, and sexual neurasthenia. Consultation hours are from 10:00 am to 6:00 pm. 20 consultation tickets are sent out every day, and each ticket costs only 5 jiao.</p>

<h3 id="e54">The Future of Coughing <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Doctor Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Coughing seems to be a common experience for everyone, but many causes of coughing are not easy to cure. The sound of coughing is endless, or there is a dry cough without phlegm, or it is not easy to cough up phlegm, or there is more dryness like cotton, or there is blood mixed in the phlegm. In short, coughing that is not cured will be very dangerous in the future. Nineteen out of ten Chinese people have latent lung diseases. Usually, because the resistance is strong, it surrounds the tuberculosis bacteria on all sides, but the resistance often disappears due to coughing. This tuberculosis bacteria then breaks through and comes out like a tiger released from its cage. It is rampant and uninhibited. Therefore, lung disease follows coughing, which is even more common. To prevent coughing from deteriorating, the cough must be cured quickly. "Bofei Naer" is indeed the only effective medicine for relieving coughs and eliminating phlegm. Whether it is second or third stage lung disease, it will be cured immediately, and it has long been praised by Chinese and foreign lung disease experts.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Thrift Association's Solemn Announcement to Citizens: Save Money on Enjoyment to Aid Those in Distress - Do Not Forget the Misery of Compatriots in Difficulties During Christmas Revelry - Earnest Words That the Public Should Know and Be Inspired By <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>As the Western custom of Christmas is approaching, Shanghai's dance halls are taking advantage of the opportunity to decorate for Christmas and prepare to operate all night. The city's Thrift Movement Committee believes that during this time of national crisis, it is not permissible to spend excessively on revelry. Money spent on celebrating and dancing should be used to aid fellow compatriots in distress. Yesterday, it publicly issued a letter to citizens from all walks of life. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Crying from Hunger and Cold, Amidst the Rain of Bullets</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army created an unprecedented war in Chinese history, it has been more than three years. People in the war zone are displaced and homeless, countless compatriots are crying in misery, and millions of brave soldiers are enduring cold and hunger, entering and leaving the rain of bullets, sacrificing their blood and heads, and fighting to defend their homeland. In such an epoch-making evolution of war, to speak honestly, heaven has given us who live in Shanghai too much favor.</p>
<p>Enjoying to the Fullest in a Corner of the Isolated Island</p>
<p>Although Shanghai after becoming an isolated island is in a relatively harsh environment and the air is exceptionally suffocating, it has the opportunity to enjoy to the fullest. The lives of ordinary people have even exceeded the state before the war. The deformed development of entertainment venues and the special prosperity of dance halls and theaters will surely cause people who have just stepped into the isolated island from the mainland to feel surprised and have the feeling of heaven and hell.</p>
<p>Do Not Forget Compatriots in Distress on the Eve of Revelry</p>
<p>Now, the ladies and gentlemen on the isolated island are about to spend the night of revelry at Christmas. In the midst of Santa Claus stroking his beard and smiling, and the rising and falling sounds of jazz music, a happy group of people in Shanghai will be rejoicing and wallowing in extravagance. But we hope that the ladies and gentlemen who are preparing to celebrate should also look at another corner of Shanghai before singing and dancing, where tens of thousands of homeless compatriots are stranded. They are without clothes to keep them warm and without food to feed them. Showing a pitiable look of malnutrition, they are leading their children and eagerly expecting us to rescue them.</p>
<p>Compassion is Shared by All</p>
<p>At the same time, under the current situation of rapidly rising prices, countless coolies and civilians are suffering from the oppression of life and crying in misery. The entire society is exposing an undisguised crisis. Can we still bear to dance on the edge of a knife? As the saying goes, "Compassion is shared by all." We should save some of the unnecessary entertainment expenses from our abundance of food and clothing to help those poor and helpless compatriots. This is not only to show our benevolence, but also to show that we do not forget the national crisis in our entertainment. Ladies and gentlemen, aiding those in distress is the responsibility of every individual. I hope everyone will rise up together.</p>
<h3 id="e56">US Radio Station Continues to Be Disturbed, Situation May Escalate - Radio Station Determined to Retaliate - Entire Incident to Be Handled in Washington <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The broadcasting of the American-owned China American Broadcasting Station (call sign XMHA) in the city has been disrupted by the Japanese side in recent days. The US consulate authorities have lodged a protest with the Japanese side because of this, and are currently awaiting a reply from the Japanese side. Yesterday (the 20th), the Japanese side intensified the disruption of the US radio station's wavelengths, and it was even more serious than before.</p>
<p>Unable to Receive Broadcasts in Shanghai Suburbs</p>
<p>According to China American Broadcasting Station manager Hailai, the source of the disruption is believed to be a Japanese warship in the Huangpu River, which is now trying to block the station's shortwave broadcasts, causing the suburbs of Shanghai to be unable to receive them, but the shortwave broadcasts can still be received in distant areas. Also, a spokesman for the Japanese Consulate General claimed that yesterday (the 20th) may not be a reply to the US protest, as the matter is being considered and will be replied to in the near future. In addition, the spokesman declined to discuss the matter in detail.</p>
<p>Retaliation Inevitable if Disruption Continues</p>
<p>It is rumored that the China American Broadcasting Station intends to retaliate and disrupt the two radio stations of the Japanese side in the city. The reporter asked Hailai about this, who replied that if there is no change in a few days, then I will deal with it. If the other party really wants to provoke trouble, we will never give up. The other party should understand that the United States has the most powerful recorders in the world, and we can remove them from the map. If this matter goes to extremes, the radio listeners in Shanghai will suffer, but we will obtain the rights we deserve.</p>
<p>US Consulate's Attitude is Also Very Firm</p>
<p>According to US consulate sources, the US protest on Wednesday asked the Japanese side to reply as soon as possible within a reasonable range. If there is no reply within a reasonable time, then the entire incident will be handed over to Washington and the US Embassy in Tokyo, asking them to obtain a satisfactory solution from the Japanese Foreign Ministry. According to reports, the Japanese side began disrupting the China American Broadcasting Station's broadcasts on the 600 and 630 frequencies from the afternoon of Monday, making them unreceivable. However, the station continued to broadcast uninterrupted on the 650 frequency and shortwave, until the shortwave broadcasts were also disrupted yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Statements Made by Japanese Spokesman</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy refused to admit or deny that the Japanese side was disrupting the China American Broadcasting Station at a press conference yesterday. Regarding the statement made by China American Broadcasting Station manager Hailai that the United States has the world's most powerful generators to attack Japanese radio stations, he said he personally did not believe it. The spokesman admitted that the views of the Japanese Radio Management Committee and the American Radio Station differed, and that talks were underway to reach a solution. As for the protest filed by the US Consulate General, it is currently under investigation. When asked about the details of the different views between the radio station and the management committee, it was said that it is hoped that a compromise can be reached. As for the source of the disruption, it is currently under investigation. The spokesman also said that, based on the reason of maintaining order, freedom of speech must be subject to considerable restrictions. For example, the so-called anarchy in Shanghai caused by Japan creating a new order, as stated in this city's opinion, is of course also subject to restrictions. Hailai's desire to abuse freedom of speech will not help the friendly resolution of the incident. When a reporter asked if the news report was considered an abuse of freedom of speech by the Japanese side, the spokesman replied that the positions were different, and the explanations were also different.</p>

<p>The blockade line previously set up by the Japanese in West Shanghai, except for the intersection of Daxilu and Jing'an Temple Road, and the intersection of Daxilu and Yidingpan Road, remains as before. The obstacles set up at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Ping'an Road, and next to the Bailai Store on Yuyuan Road, have all been removed yesterday. The armed Japanese soldiers have also withdrawn. Wangjia Alley on Daxilu was still blockaded last night, and the shops along the road on Zaijia Street were demolished yesterday. It is reported that the Japanese side will build a new road from this end, passing through Zaijia Alley and directly reaching Kainalu.</p>

<p>The Japanese Mail Company's Haruna Maru arrived in port from Singapore at 8:30 yesterday morning, docking at the Pudong pier with 80 Japanese nationals on board, all of whom were evacuees from places such as Mumbai, Calcutta, and Singapore.

<p>Cotton cocoons and other goods in the occupied areas are completely controlled by the Japanese side. Therefore, transporting them to Shanghai requires obtaining permits and removal certificates. Otherwise, they will be detained upon arrival in Shanghai, heavily confiscated or lightly fined. There have been many cases of detention and heavy fines in the past. On the previous two days, five more ships, including the German-owned Haikang Haiyi, and the Italian-owned small ships Lema Liping Mansina, etc., transported a large amount of cotton cocoons from the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Jiangbei area. Because they did not have the above-mentioned procedures, they were discovered by the Japanese naval police and were not allowed to unload. The three Italian small ships were monitored at Roosevelt Wharves 1 and 2, and the Haikang and Haiguan ships were monitored at Wharves 12 and 14 on the Bund. The respective companies are now trying to find a solution.</p>

<p>Aside from accepting the two items of increasing salaries, allowances, and allowing Chinese constables to be selected as detectives, the French side has not yet responded to the remaining fifteen items, causing great enthusiasm among the Chinese constables. To prevent accidents, the French side has implemented precautions in various police stations within the concession, making necessary preparations. However, the Chinese constables deeply understand the situation and are willing to seek a reasonable solution. Therefore, they voluntarily reduced the remaining fifteen articles to eleven. At 4 PM the day before yesterday, they sent two representatives to Chief Inspector Zhou Shangyi, submitting a second request, asking him to forward it to the French side for a swift response. At the same time, they reiterated to the authorities that they have absolutely no background and are only seeking job security. To avoid escalating the situation and resolve it as soon as possible, the French authorities have reportedly agreed to consider it further.</p>
<p>Submission Requesting an Early Reply</p>
<p>When the Chinese constable representatives met with the Chief Inspector the day before yesterday, they submitted a document, the original text of which reads: "Submission requesting review. It is found that the previous seventeen articles of demands submitted by the Central Police Station have been approved by your Excellency for consideration and response. It has been a week now, and there has been no clear instruction, causing deep dissatisfaction among all Chinese constables. The authorities are also worried about the recurrence of incidents, and are stepping up vigilance, creating a deadlock. Now, after joint consideration by various police stations, they have been revised to eleven articles. The representatives are in such a position that they are determined not to cause any major incidents. They are submitting the eleven articles to your Excellency for consideration first, and hoping that the authorities will give a satisfactory reply in the shortest time to avoid prolonging the incident, causing further complications, and affecting the overall situation's safety, and also allowing the Chinese constables to serve with peace of mind as soon as possible. Request your Excellency to carefully consider. Respectfully submitted by all Chinese constables of the French Concession, to be forwarded to the Superintendent of Police for review."</p>
<p>Revised Articles Total Eleven Items</p>
<p>The revised conditions proposed by the Chinese constables consist of eleven items, all related to job security. The contents are as follows: (1) Request permission to establish a Chinese Constables Mutual Aid Association; (2) Salary requests and allowances, etc., should be paid from November of this year, double salary at the end of the year, and the salary should be issued according to the current monthly living expenses; (3) Chinese officers should not be suspended or severely punished without reason (i.e., changed to demerits or reprimands). If a fine is imposed, it should not exceed two yuan; (4) Chinese constables' firearms should not be recovered for compensation or suspension if they are robbed due to irresistible force; (5) Chinese police officers should not work more than eight hours a day, and should do a four-hour preparatory shift the day before each rest day; (6) Chinese constables should be allowed to wear uniforms freely outside after work to save time; (7) Uniform inspections should be divided into four times a year, with drill and uniform inspection at the same time; (8) General room inspections should not be carried out except for special Chinese commemorative days and French National Day.

<p>It is reported that after the White Russian unit of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps is subordinated to the Police Department on the 15th of next month, regarding the unit's clothing, in order to save expenses, it has been decided not to change the uniforms for the time being, but to change the three items of cap badge, shoulder badge, and buttons to the police officer's standard of the Police Department. The green canvas ammunition belts and bayonet pouches used by the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will be changed to leather. However, this is a temporary measure. Once next summer arrives, the uniforms of the White Russian unit must be changed to police uniforms.</p>
<p>Police Strength Greatly Enhanced</p>
<p>After the White Russian unit of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps is subordinated to the Police Department, according to the suggestion of Mr. Feili Pu, the chief executive of the Municipal Council, the fourteen military transport vehicles of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps headquarters will also be transferred to the Police Department at the same time. These transport vehicles were originally used by the White Russian unit of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. Now that it is subordinated, it should still maintain its speed of mobilization. Moreover, the White Russian unit of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps has received complete army training and is the only powerful armed force of the Municipal Council. After the subordination, the strength of the Police Department will be greatly increased.</p>

<h3 id="e65">The National Government Maintains a Cautious Attitude Towards the Issuance of Legal Tender, Maintaining the Original Amount of Reserves, Making it One of the Soundest Currencies in the World <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>The foundation of China's legal tender system was originally extremely stable. Normally, cash reserves were always above 60%, exceeding the general level of various countries. The credibility of the legal tender has hardly been shaken in the three years of the war, making it one of the soundest currencies in the world. Wartime finance has never resorted to paper money policies. Financial markets in various places, through the cooperation of government banks and local financial authorities, have all entered the right track. Now the government is determined to maintain the value of the legal tender with all its strength. Since the establishment of the Sino-American 100 million US dollar loan, the Sino-British 10 million pound loan, and the Sino-Soviet 100 million yuan tea agreement, the foundation of China's legal tender has become more and more consolidated. Now the National Government has decided on the following measures for the legal tender policy: (1) Strive to replenish cash reserves and always maintain the original fixed amount; (2) Issue with restraint. If the reserves are sufficient but the issuance is unrestrained, it will still not be able to maintain its credibility. Now, a cautious attitude is always maintained towards the issuance of legal tender, and there will never be a vicious inflation; (3) Accumulate gold and silver; (4) Absorb foreign exchange, concentrate export foreign exchange, and absorb overseas Chinese remittances. On the one hand, restrict the supply of foreign exchange to save expenses. Therefore, the credibility of the legal tender itself has increased compared to before the war. The abnormal state of the occupied areas is not a problem.</p>

<p>Since the US Treasury Department donated 50 million yuan to the National People's Congress for the China Relief Fund, the American Red Cross has been withdrawing funds at any time to purchase food, medicine, and clothing to be transported to China to relieve the victims in various places. The first batch of medicines, valued at 350,000 yuan, arrived in Yangon yesterday and were supervised by Zhang Sili, deputy director of the China Relief Department of the American Red Cross, and entered the Chinese interior via the Yunnan-Burma Road for use by Chinese relief organizations, Chinese hospitals, and American hospitals. The second batch of medicines, totaling 20,000 vitamin pills, has been shipped from San Francisco by Clipper and another 100,000 pills have been shipped by the President Taft yesterday and will arrive in Shanghai on January 19th next year. As for the general manager of the American Red Cross, Baker, who was originally scheduled to leave Kunming on the 10th of this month via Zhujiang and Chongqing, changed his itinerary for some reason, went to Hong Kong from Kunming, transferred to Guilin on the 12th, and inspected refugee hospitals and new villages, etc., and was quite satisfied. Afterwards, he went to Liuzhou and transferred to Yishan for inspection. Once his official duties are completed, he will return to Guilin via Hengyang and plan the distribution of medicines and relief. He will then return to Hong Kong via Shaozhou. He is afraid that he will not come to Shanghai in the short term.</p>

<p>After the Shanghai Postal Administration and all its branch offices submitted a request to the authorities to increase the living allowance by 150% and the year-end bonus should include the living allowance, Director Zha Peilin forwarded it to the Kunming Postal Administration for review, but it was not approved. Now, in order to sympathize with their demands, Zha plans to send another telegram to Minister of Transportation and Director Guo of the General Administration to appeal. It is also heard that the person in charge of the union has also decided to assist. Now all the staff are still waiting for the authorities to reply by telegram.</p>
<p>Knitting Engineers</p>
<p>The three hundred or so engineers employed by more than 120 knitting factories believe that everything is expensive and their livelihoods are difficult. Their monthly income is not enough to cover their expenses. They have made a request to the capital side to increase their salaries and improve their treatment. Since a satisfactory reply has not yet been received, they have jointly gone on strike since the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the Political Department of the Municipal Council sent personnel to mediate, but because the capital side had no intention of accepting, no progress was made. Now, the following is a record of their demands:</p>
<p>Request for Salary Increase and Allowances</p>
<p>(A) Salary increase: (1) Salary increase of 60% (starting from November); (2) Rice subsidy of five dou per month; (3) Living allowance of 30 yuan per person per month; (4) One-third of the public records (yarn heads, etc.) should be distributed to each engineer according to salary (calculated for the whole year of 1929); (5) One tenth of the bonus should be distributed to each engineer according to salary, and the original benefits should not be canceled; (B) Improvement of treatment: (1) For managing machines, each engineer and assistant should not manage more than 14 machines; (2) No deduction of salary for work stoppage, factory stoppage, or engineer's sick leave (medical expenses shall be borne by the factory); (3) Holiday dates, every Sunday or commemorative day, if work is not stopped, wages should be doubled; (4) Working hours should not exceed ten hours per day; (5) No dismissal without reason; (C) Attachments: Interns should be given a monthly salary of 10 yuan. If additional personnel are needed in the future, the engineer's permission should be obtained before they can be hired. It is decided that the salary during the strike period will be paid as usual. Since more than 300 engineers went on strike, the order has been maintained. However, all factories have been unable to start work. More than 30,000 male and female workers hope that the capital side will properly mediate.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Xie Gongzhan's Funeral Held Yesterday <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The famous painter Xie Gongzhan passed away in his Shanghai residence on the 19th of this month. The funeral was held yesterday afternoon.

<h3 id="e69">Christmas Decorations: Ivory Red and Holly Leaves <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>In just three days, it will be Christmas 1940. Although Göring's planes are roaring over the British Isles, dropping bombs like unloading cargo, and the price of rice in Shanghai is so expensive that it can almost be strung together as a pearl necklace, the "Happy Christmas" of all peoples, regardless of boundaries, is finally standing before our eyes.</p>
<p>Apart from the gift advertisements in the newspapers, which are varied and too numerous to mention, the smiling, bloated, yet vibrant Santa Claus in a red robe with fur trim is still the same as ever, without any change. Speaking generally, Christmas trees or ivory red, etc., there are some real differences. Because these Christmas decorative plants, like the "New Year's offerings" of bamboo and wintersweet when we celebrate the New Year, there are also some differences here. We may as well take this opportunity to talk about it as a prelude to celebrating the holiday.</p>
<p>The plants used to make Christmas trees are mostly pine and cypress trees. There are two types that we often see here: the ordinary ones sold on display are pine trees, with leaves like sharp knives, very prickly. It is the most widely used timber plant in our country. It can be used to build houses, bridges, and manufacture equipment. It can also be used as railway sleepers and aircraft materials. The ones sold in companies are called cypress, with leaves like thorns, but the tender leaves look like cypress, so they are commonly called thorny cypress. The pine trees sold on the street are all temporarily inserted, while the cypress is a whole tree with roots, so it is sold very expensive. Both of these trees are originally very tall.</p>
<p>The plant with red leaves like flowers and the head of Santa Claus painted together is called poinsettia. In our country, it is called poinsettia (commonly known as ivory red). There are many bottle-shaped things on the top of the branches, with many flowers in each bottle, each flower has only one stamen, and there is a small concave outside the bottle, which is a honey trough. The poinsettia relies on this honey trough and red leaves to attract insects to mediate its pollen.</p>
<p>The plant with thorny leaves and bright red berries, often tied together with bells, is called holly. It is a type of holly because the leaves are very similar to a kind of osmanthus called "holly," so it has this name. There are no ones sold on the street, but there are some planted by the plank bridge in the French Park. Holly is very common in Europe. The leaves can be used to make copper materials, and the wood can be used to make utensils.</p>
<p>Another kind is mistletoe, which is a dense evergreen plant. The roots grow in large trees and absorb water and nutrients, so it is parasitic. It is often used as a decoration during Christmas in foreign countries, but it is not very common here. It can occasionally be seen in flower stalls. The fruits of holly and mistletoe are very poisonous to humans and should not be tasted.</p>
<p>At this time, the flower stalls in our country display wintersweet, daffodils, willow buds, hyacinths (foreign daffodils), and evergreen trees. You can often see a kind of evergreen tree with a flat and large red fruit on it. In fact, this red fruit is the fruit of thorny pepper, which the flower sellers put on it. (Yu Yong)</p>

<p>According to a reliable source from the Shanghai Times, on Wednesday night at approximately 10:30 PM, at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road, a Japanese military truck carrying Japanese soldiers and a British commercial bus collided violently, causing two Japanese soldiers to suffer head trauma and broken necks. According to reliable sources, after the two Japanese soldiers were sent to Fumin Hospital, they were transferred to the Japanese military hospital at 12:45 PM yesterday (the 19th) due to severe injuries. One soldier died of his injuries in the afternoon. It is not yet clear how many Japanese soldiers were in the truck when the two vehicles collided. It is only known that six other soldiers were also slightly injured. These Japanese soldiers were mostly Japanese military police stationed in the South City, who were transferred to Hongkou to serve and were returning to the South City by truck. The driver ran a red light while passing through Sichuan Road and Nanjing Road, causing the car accident. According to the Japanese military police, they are cooperating with the Police Department of the Public Concession to investigate who is responsible for the accident. The Traffic Section of the Police Department said that they are currently asking witnesses to describe the incident.</p>

<p>As the weather turns cold and the year draws to a close, petty thieves and illegal elements are becoming active, taking advantage of the opportunity to commit crimes, resulting in an increase in criminal cases in the Public Concession last month, up by 10% from before. The authorities of the two concessions have specially increased the number of police officers patrolling day and night to effectively maintain good security in the concession. They have also repaired and arranged the barbed wire fences at the borders and have tightened the enforcement of nighttime curfews.</p>

<p>According to Hua Guang News Agency, a Japanese military vehicle was driving over the Zhongshan Bridge on Zhongshan Road the night before last when the driver accidentally lost control and overturned into the Suzhou River with the vehicle and its occupants. Because it was late at night, it was impossible to call for help. As a result, six or seven Japanese soldiers drowned. Many of the vehicle's supplies sank to the bottom of the river. The survivors ran to the nearby Japanese headquarters to report, and a large number of officers and soldiers were dispatched to the scene to inspect, retrieve the corpses, and remove water stains. They also suspected that the overturned vehicle was caused by sabotage by Chinese guerrilla units and immediately announced a curfew, cutting off traffic on Zhongshan Road. Anyone who passed by was not allowed to pass and was subjected to strict searches.</p>

When the investigation was concluded, Chen felt that he was implicated for no reason and that his reputation was affected for life. Out of shame and resentment, he suddenly had a short-sighted thought. On the 18th, he went home and swallowed poison to commit suicide. His wife, Li, discovered it and reported it to the police station. He was taken to Guangci Hospital by car, but the treatment was ineffective. He died at 6 AM the next morning.</p>

<p>Since its establishment, the Pingjiang Children's Home has been in operation for two years and has taken in 134 orphans. However, because the original site is small, it cannot take in many more orphans. Therefore, a site has been found on Datong Road to build a new home so that the number of orphans it can take in can be increased. A broadcast fundraiser was held previously, raising more than 12,500 yuan, but the amount is still insufficient. In addition to the directors of the home widely soliciting donations, it has also been decided to invite famous Yue opera, Shen opera, storytelling, Pinghua, and storytellers to participate in the broadcast on the 22nd and 23rd of this month at the Guohua, Xinhua, Tianlu, and Huaying four stages to solicit construction fees, regular expenses, etc. At that time, we urge all great philanthropists to be charitable, generous, and supportive, which is truly immeasurable merit.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Enjoying the Pleasure of Life <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>We should enjoy the pleasures of life while we are living it. No matter what kind of work we do, we should always be happy and respectful, so that we can be fascinated by the work. There is an old saying in China: "A person without a smile should not open a shop." This saying contains truth because how can a person who always wears a bitter face succeed? The ancient Greeks also had a saying: "A sound mind in a sound body." Therefore, no matter what kind of work we do, we must have a healthy body.</p>
<p>However, no one can live their entire life without illness. Not to mention dangerous and serious illnesses, even a little pain—headache, toothache, rheumatism, or neuralgia, or menstrual pain—is already very painful. With this kind of pain, we feel disappointed because we cannot work, cannot participate in social events. Even watching a movie becomes impossible.</p>
<p>But this pain can be quickly stopped, so there is no need to suffer. The fastest and safest way to relieve pain is to take one or two tablets of Analgesin. The pain will completely disappear within ten minutes, and our bodies will feel very comfortable. Analgesin is manufactured by Swiss Linfro-Monro Co., Ltd., so it is extremely safe and reliable.</p>

<p>The Chinese team has suffered two consecutive defeats in the Fourth Shen Bao Cup Sino-American Charity Basketball Tournament. Their bad luck has caused universal regret. In the first game, they played very well in the second half, but lost due to excessive points lost in the first half. In the second game, victory was in their grasp, but unexpectedly there was a sudden change at the end, and the outcome could not be reversed by human effort. However, the Chinese team's performance was excellent, and their spirit of perseverance was universally praised. To show their determination not to give up, the third game will be held as usual tonight, starting at 8 PM in the Western YMCA gym. The originally scheduled Sino-Western women's basketball performance has been canceled due to a Christmas party at the Western YMCA and no available gym time. The Western YMCA has been fully booked for the past two nights. Tonight, there are still 200 tickets available downstairs and 410 tickets upstairs. The number of tickets is limited, so please purchase them as soon as possible from the Shen Bao office on Hankou Road and the Western YMCA on Jing'an Temple Road. You can enjoy the excellent basketball skills, cheer for the Chinese team, and also increase revenue for charitable donations. The rosters of the two teams are as follows:</p>

Carson of the Bears opened the scoring first, and Tao Shaosheng of Paramount immediately retaliated. Yenik made a free throw, taking the lead 3 to 2. Chen Xianglong scored a long shot, reversing the lead to 4 to 3. The Bears' offensive was very fierce from then on, with Kraus, Tauberlinking, and Carson scoring consecutively, leading all the way. In the first half, the Bears scored 22 points, and Paramount scored 7 points. After switching sides, Paramount tried to retaliate, but unfortunately their luck was not good, and the Bears became unusually active. Carson scored eight consecutive points, and the score increased sharply. Zhang Shaoqing and Tao Shaosheng of Paramount were also ruled out of the game due to four fouls. Reinforcements were called up, but it was too late to save the situation. As a result, the Bears won 45 to 23.</p>

<p>The top ten players who won the Kong Sheng Cup individual championship held an individual championship elimination tournament at Jingwu Stadium at 7 PM the night before last.

Lu Hanjun became more and more courageous, and as a result, he eliminated Wang Changhou 3-1 and advanced to the second game, where he met Fu Qifang. This match was a matter of life and death. Fu's spinning ball was as fast as a meteor, and Lu repeatedly fell behind. Fortunately, he was able to adapt to the situation and attack while defending, tying the score at two each. The competition in the fifth game became even more intense. Lu handled it carefully and narrowly escaped with a two-point lead. As a result, he won 3-2 and won the final.

(3) The instructor should live in the team in principle, so as to live with the new students and implement life guidance, so as to achieve a subtle effect. (4) For students with incorrect thoughts and wrong views, the instructor should have more individual talks with them, introduce reading materials, and ask them to read, and make every effort to guide them to the right path.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Watching War Newsreels <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Xiangyou</p>
<p>I sat in the dark for two hours and fifteen minutes, watching the war newsreel that the German Embassy invited people from all walks of life to visit.</p>
<p>The whole film is almost all crystallized from bombs and shells. Explosions and fireworks, burning are the important work of the "dubbing" and "lighting" of this film, and it is also the main enjoyment of the audience.</p>
<p>One thing worth admiring is the systematic work of their cameramen. The angle of photography, the selection of materials, the method of expression, and the appropriate editing all make us, these staff members, admire them. But when I think that these civilized tools are not used to express the progress of civilization, but to exaggerate destruction, I feel that maybe this world is crazy.</p>
<p>Coming out of the door, the cold wind was piercing, but the bombing and burning, etc., were still active in my mind, making people think of the reality of the "civilization" that we ourselves are experiencing. At the same time, I was also aware that these propaganda, these "good films" also seem to be extending a hand of begging for "sympathy" to us.</p>
<p>But I shook my head!</p>
<p>Family</p>
<h3 id="e95">Sister-in-law <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Yin</p>
<p>If I write about my sister-in-law from my position, my brother might say that I am being reckless? Because we used to be so "fake," but I have always had infinite sympathy for this honest and infatuated brother!</p>
<p>My sister-in-law is a woman who has received general education and has both new and old ideas. She believes in Buddhism and has to eat scriptures several times a month. At the same time, she is also a vain and gold-worshipping person, which can be proved in many ways.</p>
<p>Since she married my brother, the family has been more lively, but all the unfortunate troubles have also been revealed from everyone's hearts, as if there is a terrible demon catching us. We are all escaping from it and trying to find our happiness, which is like a sense of responsibility.</p>
<p>At first, she only lost her temper, but later her material desires became greater and greater, and my brother's ability gradually declined.</p>
<p>My brother implemented her going to school and learning Chinese typing. She said that she didn't even wash her handkerchief at her mother's house. She wanted to dedicate herself to society. Soon she became a female typist, and her "income" was said to be used to subsidize her mother's family. My mother said that she was actually a "filial daughter," and my brother respected her for this. The reason why he went from respect to fear is perhaps a good one!</p>
<p>This should be her most popular time! Dressed up quite flamboyantly, she went out with her boss in a car, and invited a group of colleagues to play cards at home and go out to see plays. She said that she had to socialize with people for her job, and that my brother had no skills and didn't know how to socialize.</p>
<p>She has changed, hating my brother, saying that he is incompetent. She told us that she regretted her "marriage" and that she had married such a person without assets. At the same time, she felt that she had seen the "big world" and kept praising those outstanding foreign houses, beautiful cars, and beautiful gardens. She tortured my brother; when she was angry, she asked my brother to do everything a servant did to entertain herself. If my brother intended to "make trouble" with her, she would cry and curse, throwing things on the ground to "vent her anger." Sometimes my mother went to persuade her, and she often gave her an embarrassing answer: "Look at your son, I can't stand his mischief, can I?" My brother was weakened, and his bright eyes became so melancholy and disappointed. He endured the pain, wanting this incomprehensible wife to understand his love, and this humble, submissive attitude earned him some ridicule from his relatives and friends. Everyone's heart in the family was immersed in an atmosphere of unease and anxiety.</p>
<p>My father asked them to form a separate small family, but soon they moved back in, the reason being that there was not enough money to spend, the servants were always changing, and no one could take good care of things if they were taken away. My mother agreed to them. At this time, my sister-in-law was "pregnant," but she believed that she was sick and had to ask a doctor. This also had to be fussed about, the medicine was not good, it was not a famous doctor! She also said that her husband hoped she would die early. In short, she still disagreed with my brother, and her personality changed constantly. My mother was busy serving her food all day long, and we were so easily offended her, even if we said a word to my brother, she suspected that it was "attacking" her. Soon, she gave birth to a child in the hospital. She did not believe in my mother's experience, she believed in her new method of raising children. In that cold winter, she had to ask the wet nurse to give the child a warm water bath in the middle of the day. The child caught a cold and turned into seizures, and then died without being saved. The death of the child was a painful blow to my brother, and my sister-in-law became even more romantic. She often did not return home for one or two days. At night, my brother sat alone in a daze. He was waiting for the door, the car horn sounded, the door bell rang, he went to open the door, he did not smile or get angry. Everyone in the family slept so sweetly, I was awake. I felt that my brother could not get rid of a kind of bondage, he was already very tired.</p>
<p>The flames of war separated us all, she and my brother went to Hankou, and we - my parents and siblings - turned to Shanghai</p>
<p>Parting will make people sigh. My brother's letters showed that he was more lonely and bored. On the one hand, he was aware that my sister-in-law had a strange temper. My brother wanted to reduce our bad influence on her and hide it for her without saying anything.</p>
<p>One day, we received a letter from my brother, which made me guess that my brother wrote with so much deep pain and contained heavy feelings of anger and solemnity, and my mother shed tears.</p>
<p>He said that he spent the morning alone in the park thinking. He thought of staging a tragedy, wanting to do something to her: he looked at the pistol in his hand, he looked at the blue sky, thinking of his parents who loved him thousands of miles away, he repented to heaven! He decided not to do this, so as not to make his parents sad. It turned out that my sister-in-law lied to him that she was returning to her mother's house, but cohabited with a man with a stinky copper coin, and finally abandoned her loving husband.</p>
<p>They divorced by signing the paper at a law firm.</p>
<p>My brother said that the Yellow Crane Tower would be a place he would never forget. In his memory, they had a last trip once. My brother then got drunk and left the town.</p>
<p>I silently prayed that my brother would take on the mission for the country and the family and build a happy and bright future family.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Recent News from Leren Hospital <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Shuyi</p>
<p>Heating Equipment Added to Wards</p>
<p>Leren Hospital on Gubach Road in this city has not been in operation for three years, but with the painstaking efforts of Dr. Yin, the president of the hospital, to plan and improve it, the scale is quite large. Moreover, it is known for its serious diagnosis and treatment and does not allow any perfunctory work. Therefore, it has a very good reputation and is highly praised by all sectors of society. Each department of the hospital has been invited to be in charge of diagnosis by registered specialist doctors. This autumn, in view of the urgent need for pediatrics in Shanghai, President Yin specially hired Dr. Xu Duo, a pediatric expert, to take charge of consultation. Dr. Xu has a medical doctorate from Canada in North America, and later studied with Dr. Shi Ke De, a famous American pediatrician, for many years. Her knowledge and experience have reached the extreme. In the past few months, she has treated and saved hundreds of people who were in danger, and her reputation is well-known. The patients praised her, and the news was reported in the previous report. In addition, the hospital's medical equipment, such as X-ray machines, sun lamps, Cromier lamps, short-wave radio therapy equipment, etc., are all available and are the latest models. In addition, the operating room is equipped with a modern operating table that can be raised, lowered, and rotated freely. The disinfection sink is also novel and unique. The specially built glass room is bright and translucent, and every detail can be seen, which provides great security assistance for surgery. It can be said to be perfect. Now that it is the middle of winter, the temperature is very important to patients. It is heard that the hospital has recently started temperature regulation, so that every ward is as warm as spring, and there is no need to worry about the cold attacking the group. When the writer visited the hospital recently, it was during a rest period, and I was accompanied to visit the hospital for a week. The order of each department was well-organized and not complicated. All the wards were full. It is heard that President Yin has always taken service as his own responsibility, so the fees are very low, and the poor are not counted. It is a rare benevolence. The impression is very good, so I specially wrote it down for the patients to have something to rely on.</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>At this moment, the handsome young man sneered and said, "I have long heard of your honor's virtuous name, but if you cannot discern people in the world of courtesans, how can you be called a famous scholar of the world? I find you quite blind." After saying these words, he flicked his sleeves and left. He went straight to Liu Rushi's dressing room in Nan's residence. There, he took off his scholar's cap and outer garments, revealing himself to be a beautiful woman. Where did this illusion come from? It was Liu Rushi herself who had exchanged her hairpin for a hat, deliberately going to Chen Wuzi's home to test his true intentions. Jiangzi walked into the room and asked, "Sister, you just went to see Chen Wuzi. Did he recognize your true face? How did he respond when you tested him?" Liu Rushi sighed and said, "Chen Wuzi is famous in vain. If he cannot discern people in the world of courtesans, how is he worthy of being a famous scholar of the world? I have wasted my deep affection on him, it is truly vexing." Jiangzi said, "Sister, why be vexed? Chen Wuzi is so stubborn and unfeeling, why must you be so attached to him? With your talent and beauty, countless people would be enamored with you. One day, you will not have to worry about finding a good husband to serve..." Before Jiangzi could continue, Liu Rushi put a slender finger to her lips, silencing her, and said, "Little sister, you are so young, why are you talking about husbands? " Jiangzi smiled and went to her own room to read. Liu Rushi sat alone, resting her chin on her hand, deep in thought and very bored. Suddenly, Qian Muzhai came again, bringing several valuable gifts to give to Liu Rushi. He personally placed a flower in Liu Rushi's hair, saying with refined words, "Comparing the flower to you, you are ten times more beautiful than the flower." Then, he took paper and brush and composed four poems praising the flower, all in the five-character律(lǜ) form, extremely fragrant and beautiful, with resounding tones. Liu Rushi was happy for a moment and also wrote a poem in response to Qian's intentions. Qian gently stroked her fragrant shoulders and said, "Jiang Xian's talent rivals that of a female Sima Xiangru. That is what you are." That evening, Qian Muzhai held a banquet in Rushi's dressing room, and all the famous scholars attended, except for Chen Wuzi and Zhang Tianru. Chen Wuzi, of course, would not come. As for Zhang Tianru, he saw that Qian Muzhai was quite fond of Liu Rushi, and Liu Rushi's poem in response to him the other day clearly showed that she was indifferent to him, so he also feigned illness and did not come. Qian Muzhai lingered in Songling for six days, visiting Liu Rushi almost every day. People like Yue Chai also knew his intentions and wanted to facilitate the matter, but they did not know what Rushi thought in her heart. Did she find Muzhai too old? When Muzhai was about to leave, Liu Rushi firmly made an appointment for a later date. Qian Muzhai replied with three months. After returning to Hongdou Villa in Yushan, he took out two red beans that he had treasured for many years, stored them in brocade, and composed ten poems about red beans, sending them to Songling via a special messenger to express his admiration. After receiving them, Liu Rushi also wrote a poem on her own silk handkerchief and sent it to Muzhai, along with letters discussing literature. Therefore, Muzhai and Liu Rushi often exchanged poems. Liu Rushi was a person who admired fame and talent. She did not want to marry Zhang Tianru, and she had personally tested Chen Wuzi's feelings, only to be rejected, which almost made her lose heart. Coincidentally, she met Qian Muzhai, whose name was renowned throughout Jiangnan and Jiangbei for his poetry and lyrics, elegant and beautiful, comparable to Bao Zhao and Yu Xin, not something that ordinary people could match. He could be called the "Sacrificial Wine" of the poetry world, so her heart could not help but be moved. After a period of mutual admiration and love, they finally became a couple. Liu Rushi promised to marry Qian Muzhai. (16)</p>

<h3 id="e102">Is Ying Yin Returning to Chongqing? <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>Ying Yin ran from Chongqing to Shanghai, played around for almost a year, and only shot one movie, "Sai Jinhua." Besides the fact that the script and director were a bit lacking, her personal acting skills were quite superb. However, after that, because of the ambiguous stance of Hezhong Company, although Xinhua and Yihua had contacted her once, the fact that she had the idea of "returning" is also true. This is the origin of the news that Ying Yin is returning to Chongqing. However, judging from the development of these two days, Ying Yin may not return to Chongqing. If Ying Yin's contractual relationship with Hezhong is really severed, she may sign a long-term contract with another film company in the shortest possible time. The most obvious fact is that because the house she originally lived in Taoyuan Village is not suitable, she has been looking for a new residence in preparation for moving, which proves that Ying Yin has a "long-term residence plan" in Shanghai. On the other hand, she will also perform in a stage play in Shanghai. Both Xinyi Theater and Shanghai Juyi Theater have reached a verbal agreement with her. It is likely that she will show her face on stage next spring. "The trip to Chongqing" seems to be just talk.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Mr. Pan Zinong of Chongqing Central Film Studio sent a telegram to friends in Shanghai, stating: Xiling passed away on the 17th morning. Chongqing has scheduled a memorial service on January 15th and hopes to notify the Shanghai film and drama circles. Friends in the Shanghai film and drama circles also plan to hold a memorial service at the same time on January 15th.</p>
<p>Yesterday, this publication received a letter from Mu Xijun, agreeing to the three measures set by the preparatory committee. Regarding the reprinting of the "Crossroads" copy, he believes that it can be handled by fundraising among Shen's friends and attached five yuan in national currency as a token of support. We contacted Mr. Zhou Chuangyun by telephone, who said that regarding the reprinting of the copy, the preparatory committee will contact the responsible person of Mingxing before making a decision.

They have invited Mr. Shi Renwang, a famous harmonica player in Shanghai, to voluntarily take on the entire program. All ticket proceeds will be donated to the nursing home to help the elderly. The concert is scheduled to be held at 8 pm on the 22nd of this month in the auditorium of Zhen Dan University on Rue Lupan. Tickets are priced at two yuan, three yuan, and five yuan, and are available for sale at Zhen Dan University and major music stores.</p>
<p>The Shanghai She Opera Troupe held its third rehearsal at the Ningbo Fellow Association today. The plays were very exciting. The daytime show was the complete "Qi Yuan Bao," and the night show was the complete "Ganlu Temple," etc.</p>
