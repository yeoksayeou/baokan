<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本近衛就職之後</h3>
<p>據聞日本近衛內閣就職後，有關對華作戰軍隊的第一道命令，即爲撤退進攻中國沿海髯波三都澳等處的海軍，調往台灣與海南島一帶集中，以待後命；又據稱英國拒絕了德國息爭謀和的建議之後，德義日西四國的秘密外交關係似已亟進；聞德義方面力促日西兩國從速參加對英作戰，蓋德義最想利用日本海軍，不但用以擾亂英國在遠東的勢力，且可分散美國對歐洲的注意力；故一般觀察者認爲日本海軍近自中國沿海撒退，乃爲日本對歐戰準備參加的又一姿態云云。這是香港方面所傳來的電訊。究竟是否以事實爲根據，尙難遽加判斷；但按之日方最近情况，則香港所傳，始非旣然的事實，却爲距離情理不遠的觀察。</p>
<p>日本自米內辭職，近衛奉命組閣經六日之久，隔昨纔舉行親任式而宣告就職。就職之後，以迄記者握管時爲止，近衛對於施政大計，尙無系統的正面表示；昨報所紀近衛與記者團的問答，祇是片段鱗爪，不夠覘知其政策的梗槪。允關於外交政策的，所談更浮泛不着邊際；所謂對中國事變求有效的解決，所謂對德義英美蘇五國皆須調整國交，所謂亟謀擺脫歷來對英美的依存性，如此云云，其空虛的程度等於零。當然，我們不以爲近衛的抱負幾等於零；但這一次米內下野，固有種種遠因近因，而陸軍方面忽然表示不復繼續合作而使米內內閣非立即總辭職小可，則其舉動與來勢殊不可諱言於突兀；故近衛雖曰有其遠大的抱負，周詳的擘畫，而目前遽膺組閣之命，則其時機與準備，殊不可諱言於早熟。組閣緩慢，談片浮泛，皆是早熟的徵象吧！</p>
<p>早熟的近衛內閣，應付當前所遭遇的難關重重，旣非成竹在胸，安望指揮若定！斯如港電所傳；日本海軍自寗波三都澳方面引退，乃爲近衛政策下之軍略性質的舉招，自不可信。外相松岡纔走馬上任，對國際尙未開始行動，乃謂德義日西四國的秘密外次似已亟進，此又不「似」。海軍自中國沿岸撒退而集中台灣與海南兩島，當係事實；對國際別無正面表示之前，即此事實又何足作爲準備參加歐戰的有效姿態。因此檢討，港電祇是觀察而不是報告。</p>
<p>然則安見如此觀察的距離情理不遠？窺近衛意態：一確是想趕快解決所謂中國事變，故於種種攻勢，必然憧　於其所快意的兼程並進；求有效，同時捐棄所不必要，糾正所無效，則於軍事佔領的點綫作部分的放棄，自在意中。二確是想有所收穫於此歐戰時期，故對於德義，對英，對美，對蘇聯，必一反往日的外交姿態；務强項，同時亦將不恤出以何種遷就；所謂準備參加歐戰的又一姿態，這是必然儘量矯揉造作的表示，但其中心意識還是憧憬於只此表示姿態，而即有所成功；若謂事實行動的參加歐戰，則在外交完全失效了之後，有待重新考量的問題，絕非所語於近衛上台之始的今日。三確是有憾於其國內，侵華三年以來，事權不一，掣肘橫生；故憧憬於融合於一黨，集權於一體；庶幾大來大往，舉重若輕；所謂新政制，豈眞是所謂制的問題。由迫切的憧憬，作實現的圖謀，這是近衛抱負的輪廓所在。我們不蔑視此類抱負，但是我們理解得：日本近年主持國政的人們，相繼鎩羽下野，不是主觀抱負的不足，而是實現所抱負之客觀條件的不足；所謂客觀條件，不在近衛囊槖之中！</p>
<h3>美國對遠東　將採積極立場　文生促請國會考慮　關島設防初步工作</h3>
<p>華盛頓　美國會某負責議員頃告合衆社記者稱、美國或將立卽對遠東問題及上海反美事件、採取積極立塲、他方面、許多國會議員因欲美國集中全力建設國防、以禦侵略、似不擬使美國對遠東之關係趨於嚴重、國會與政府領袖、因最近上海事件、對遠東外交局勢所作之考慮、亦未表明美國對於遠東、卽將採取特殊之態度或行動、但美政府此時對於遠東之態度、顯與四個月前美行政部似欲和緩對日關係之時不同、而趨於史積極的方面、日本之改組內閣及明顯的趨向全能主義、已使美國會對日之態度、大爲改變、全般之情勢、可於下次國會會議中之辯論關島設防案、趨於尖銳化、消息靈通之國會議員稱、衆院海軍委員會主席文生昨日表示、美國海軍擬於下次國會會議中、提出種種改進問題、又據政界稱、海軍刻正擬進行改進種種防禦及關島之，建設、以期擴大關島之利用云、（二十三日合衆社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　美衆院海軍委員會席主文生氏昨日宣稱、渠希望行政部將於下次會議時提出考慮關島設防之初步工作、文生氏之宜稱、引起此間人士之注意、以爲此事將於現時會議中加以討論、不致受任何重大之稽遲、海軍發言人巳通告國會、謂離日本東南一千三百哩之關島設防、乃美國太平洋防務之重要軍事步驟、惟國會已屢次反對此項引起日本海軍部非難之提議、文生氏昨日宜稱、渠預料此項提議將在國會引起極大之辯論、明納素泰共和黨衆議員馬斯告海部軍事委員會稱、渠以爲委員會應立卽聆取此項提議、馬斯稱、「如吾人將此提案待下次會議時始付之討論、則吾人或需向日本取得准許矣」、（二十四日合衆社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　美國現方醞釀一種秘密運動、欲在法律上限制新政策、使其不能操縱新國防經費一百四十萬萬美元、移用於政治方面、據國際社記者訪悉、此項運動、已由民主黨參議員之反對羅斯福第三任連任者發起、大國防經費中最後一筆意外國防費四十八萬萬美元一案、送達參院討論時、上項運動恐將公開、（二十四日國際社電）</p>

<p>重慶　據華方人士宣稱、當日軍在鎭海及甬江南北兩岸登陸、以企圖佔領寗波之時、防守寗波區域之華軍祗有兩師、華軍當局立卽徵用長江南岸各公路所有之公共汽車、卡車及汽車等、赶運生力軍隊開往寗波區域、各公共汽車站均貼出通告、謂「因汽油缺乏、公共汽車暫停行駛、」其實此項車輛均用以運輸軍隊、經日夜兼程、故能及時趕到寗波、華軍之施反攻、將日軍驅回軍艦、衆料各公路之公共汽車、不久卽將恢復原狀、（廿四日路透社電）</p>
<p>擊落日機三架</p>

<p>自工潮發生後、工部局工業科主任顧炳元、雖經度調解、但因雙主態度堅決、無從着手、而公司方面復雇用大批白俄替代工作、故煤氣供給、並未間斷、惟因新雇用之白俄缺少經騐、新工作未見圓滿、據該公司某職員稱、每日在中午時、煤氣壓力、時常减低、致各用戶之火力未免减少、但公司所用之原料、反較平時爲多、頗受相當損失、</p>
<p>傳聞今日可開談判</p>

<h3>物價調查處　籲請市民合作　奸商抬價應吿發並證明　當局方可判斷加以處置</h3>
<p>字林西報云、工都局牧價調查處某員頃籲請市民與該處合作、凡遇商人非法貿利、即行告發、俾克抑制高昂之生活程度、據稱、工部局切望引起公衆對食物與商品價格之關切、市民固可斥非法貿利者爲卑惡奸商、然工部局未獲確證、不能遽下判斷、故切欲公衆合作、每遇商人索價過昂、即向當局告發、供給確證、當局始能有所行動、</p>
<p>敦促檢舉</p>
<p>市民對於該處之工作、大多未加關心、試以家庭麵包爲例、每磅售三角八分、他種麵包、則售六七角、工部局對此已廣事宣傳、但市民頗多以未聞家庭麵包爲言者、殊可詫也、物價調查處人員、竭其所能、爲市民工作、苟接告發、必盡力理之、今有若干商人、仍濫抬物價、非法貿利、物價調查處對此、非獲確證、則無能爲力、</p>

<p>又法租界平價委員會近因鑒於公衆對於家用麵包之製造、並不充分、輒有訾議、爰經於六月二十七日、與警務處及衛生處各派代表前往界內多家麵包視察、檢得各該店所出售之家用麵包、均質佳而量足、而若干麵包店之未遵章辦理者、亦經加以制裁、</p>

<p>（仰光六月二十八日通訊）東方足球會遠征隊、今日在凄風苦雨中、以四對一擊敗仰光聯賽冠軍海關隊、上半時結果爲一對一、觀衆達一萬五千人、是役東方左翼侯澄滔表演出色、爲全塲前鋒中最危險人物、後衛吳祺祥。李義臣、亦有精彩演出、於仰光隊多取攻勢之上半時中、屢拒敵鋒於千里之外、厥功甚偉、星洲加入之紀友齡之右前衛、相當穩健、另一表演優秀者則爲左鋒曹秋亭、開賽後、海關先開紀錄、但於上半時結束前、由侯澄滔扳爲平局、下半時束方常取攻勢、但因塲地泥濘、全賽動作相當遲緩、且亦相當粗暴、侯澄滔曾於左翼地位兩次突破敵陣、舉射中的、許文奎則曾於中衛錢上以美妙之射擊、攻進一球、總結束方遂以四對一克服仰光冠軍隊、東方陣容如下、</p>

<h3>金融　外匯絕少起伏</h3>

<p>交易仍祇掉期</p>
<p>晨初以倫教大條、近升二五、遠則平定、紐約銀介仍平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美不動、對滬亦平、美對英長半分、對滬大一分、對法無市、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士八七五、美匯六元一二五、較之上日晚收、俱無更動、同時期貨開出、亦極平定、開後聞華行上海曾向外行買入本月份美匯告六元一五六二五、惟此價頗雜結得、匯豐掛牌九時半揭曉、悉無上落、白銀平衡稅增百分之一·七五、此後市面依然平穩、計美行售予華商投機家本月份美匯六元一二五、其他銀行對掉七八月份巾進均為〇六二五迨至午刻、有利銀行做開八月份匯兌三元七角七分、似略跌落、故收盤價英金微長〇一五六二五、為三便士九〇六二五、美匯六元　五、八月份六元〇六二五、比較隔昨不分軒輊、八月份英金亦軋松〇一五·六二五、午後週三無市、</p>

<h3>金市風平浪靜</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市況、更為岑寂、亦最近所罕見之市面也、此以外匯缺乏上落、場內風平浪靜、投扒者無從下手、交易殊少、晨初開盤因銀號賣出祇五千、一百四一元、較上日低三十元、後因錢兌業空頭抵進、及證券幫願於低價搜入、即拉高至五千二百八十元、惟散戶多頭則又乘機吐塞、故午收低為五千二百六十三元、較隔昨晚收軋小七元、午後週三無市、半天交易、僅約做天七八百兩之數、銀樓飾金仍平、海關金等呆定、</p>
<p>烚赤再跌七元</p>
<p>自晨第條（十兩）、初承上日之疲風、開時賣戶頗多、竟被撳小三十元、某銀號出同業二十兩、為五千二百四十元、嗣外匯呆平、金價未免過小、致不久即起相當買風、錢兌業及銀號幫吸入尤多、雖斯時某金號與搶帽子者拋出、但為數難衡、終見升四十元、銀號互做五十兩、為五千二百八十元、但此後對上價賣戶仍多、漲風立受阻撓、且未幾證券幫及散多吐出、價復不支下游、迨收盤已退至五千二百六十三元、結果比上日軋小七元、半天祇四十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高數十元、收進減低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金屹立不動</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、仍告呆平、大同行依舊懸五百四十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進減低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣穩定</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市況、烚赤變動至小、英美金鐵鎊因亦平穩、英金票需要漸減、價又下趨、美金票盤旋於十門元二角半及三角間、卒為十六元三角七分、比上日軋跌四分、香港票稍有需要、市價略漲、日金票及朝鮮票大眾需要尚殷、市價略漲、前者為一元　角一分二厘、後者為一元零分半、</p>
<h3>證券外債報跌　內債稍疲</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨市因浮多稍有脫手、買戶未見踴躍、市價稍疲、多方之未具實力者、往往隨市升沉、致市面有微波蕩漾之象、昨日上午交易較多、樂茂聯益買進、惟同康鴻大順、泰聯和等均有買出、買氣較盛、市價稍疲、午後交易極清、上落極微、已趨於靜止狀態、市價結果、一致回小一角至三角半、成交總數、約計五十餘萬元、茲列簡類明表於後、</p>
<p>類別　最高　最低　收盤　比前日</p>

<p>股票交易、成交振泰紗廠股七十股、價為九十四元、</p>
<p>眾業公所昨日股市、與本埠其他各市場同、經一二週之比較樂觀行動後、茲又轉入黯澹階段、英聯與怡和之成交復佔最多數、怡和股某注直接交易、做開有一萬股之钜、橡皮股靜穩、</p>
<p>倫敦二十三日（週二）電今日中國外債掛牌行市、又見降落、前檔之英德續借款、英發債票猛跌五鎊、價為三十鐵鎊、英法借款黃發債票跌三鎊、價為四十鎊克利斯浦借款及善後借款英發債票各跌二鎊前者為十三鎊後者為十八鎊後檔之北寗鐵路借款猛跌十六鎊、價為四十鎊、道清鐵路借款跌三鎊、價為九鎊、京滬鐵路公債跌落二鎊、價為十三鎊、其餘不動、</p>

<h3>怕丁橡股派息</h3>
<p>本埠英商祥茂洋行經理之怕丁橡皮有限公司截至一九四〇年四月底一年度之盈餘達國幣二十八萬六千餘元、除已派中期股息每股國幣一角四分外、現定於八月二十日召開第三十次股東常年大會、及臨時股東大會、末次股息亦同時開派、每股計派國幣三角、全年共派四角四分、</p>
<h3>糧食　又有大宗洋米可到　米價仍疲</h3>
<p>米市自前日回軟後、昨開市銷路仍不動、原根客販亦堅守、早市逐呈相持之局、市面尚乏變化、但一般浮囤散戶、見銷　又滯、心思已餒、首先出脫、故洋米行情小落半元左右、原根客販亦跟蹤而出、於是條降元砠、惟銷場漸見活、本鄉店　米廉取進、其意頗濃、近香形勢逐見　疲還緊、售價亦稍回昂、結果收盤一號陳西貢又遠五十六元、因聞前定西貢逞　各米均將在日內抵埠、到貨計三船約十五六萬包外、尚有香港逞越等零批二三萬包與三五千包之零批可到、因此人心虛軟、一致求脫、早市開價立即降跌元外、後以本客行囤趁小問津、路貨亦有客戶與補空活動、市乃於收市前回好二三角、路貨開市平平、旋有汕杭各幫略有問津、而補空亦稍顧問、貨方堅持、六月二十六日裝還二號米自六十二元漲至六十二元二角、較好二角、西貢二號七月上期亦漲起八角為六十一元、又碎米七月十五裝開五十元、統市成交近三百噸、現米則不足四千包雲、</p>
<p>粳糯米現到仍廖落、祇粳貨六七百包、傳聞明暗市一般貨主、因之不惟銷滯而輕脫、售盤雖貶有限、僅半元光景、常幫鮮特清粳六十九元六十八元半、特清粳六十八元、無錫清粳六十七元半、六十七元、常州蘇崑粳高自六十六元半次至六十二元、青泗薄稻六十六七元、南港早稻六十三元、斛見六十元、鮮六十一元、六十元零五元、糯米　陽特元六十三元六角、六十三元、金壇特元六十三元二角、六十二元作八角、常丹白元六十二元半、六十二元、次六十元零八角、香港特貨六十元五十九元半、市五十八元、次五十七元五十六元半雲、</p>
<h3>日粉回漲</h3>
<p>麵粉、昨日跌風已　、華廠方面、以目下生產不多、除供本街日常需用外、客方亦嫌廠盤高昂、無形停售、大部份轉移於雜牌粉、如日廠粉鳳凰牌自跌價至十四元一角後、即引起本客之動銷、計開出本月份貨二千餘包、初為十四元二角、嗣又升至十四元三角半、比前已回好二三角、其他各種雜牌粉價亦隨穩、但無整批成交、老車與福新牌粉廠盤仍須十六元、成交亦不過三四千包</p>
<p>小麥　昨市如故、因虹口新到各貨、大都上棧待沽、日廠納胃已飽、意在擯小而取、華廠則以環境惡劣、無法大量收買、所以買賣均在擯持中、</p>
<h3>紗花　消費弱生產　紗布已成僵局</h3>
<p>紗市平澹無特色、良以實際銷路無巨　的發展希望、至於外匯亦少波動、所以人心暗澹無勁、投機者亦無手腕可做、於是市面遂成僵持之局面、惟有　都心思甚為樂觀也、總之消費太弱、生產較強、兩方比較、究難平衡、照此觀察、目前如無意外之變遷、恐難十分興奮也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開場上人氣依然冷靜、新買者寥似晨星、開價為九百二十九元、比上日價跌落五六元、低價一開、搶帽子戶略為收進幾包、而抬叫微升至九百三十六元、做短心思之戶、稍可撈些油水工作、見風使舵之計、向外面吐出、又復跌至九百三十二元、就市場情形論之、大家搶帽子交易也、收盤價為九百三十四元、查半日間成交統計一千四百六十五包、行情二十支雙馬漲二元、茲將各幫口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>香港　六五五　同行八一〇　統計　四六五</p>
<h3>棉花呆滯如故</h3>
<p>現棉交易尚屬半澹、廠方舉動靜寂、至於同業中以前購訂之貨、尚未售罄、所以互相買賣、亦無興奮氣象、所有之病態與紗市同一轍也、火機草包一百五十元、同行成交一百八十包、印度花二百包、同行進二百件、均係棧交、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日市況堅定、棉區氣候報告惡劣、及一部份之空頭抵補、結果收盤價格、較之上日漲二三磅音、印度棉市　日連同預測又一羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來殊見靜寂、廠方略有添備缺貨、唯為數極微、大部仍抱觀望態度、日方廠商之需要亦殊見呆滯也、</p>
<h3>糖市　荷赤獨昂</h3>
<p>昨糖市又趨軟弱、遂致小跌、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白本棧上行六十七元八角至六角、下午六十七元六角半、小三角半、轉口貨即打棧五十二元三角至五十二元、本月底交割五十二元六角、小五六角、八月二日交貨五十二元八角、荷棉白初為七十元七角至角、下午七十元、小五角、太古車白B嘜七十七元八角至六角、小四角、惟荷赤獨見上展、以五十九元成交、升四角、本廠雪白六十八元、降半元、本一號冰八十九元、晶明冰九十元半、均降一元、</p>
<h3>油餅　生油漲風已定</h3>
<p>昨市花生油之趨勢、其騰漲之風已殺、良以行囤胃口飽　、有暫告休息之態、昨祇成交青島桶油二十桶、價為八十八元原盤、豆油雖已打開僵局、但其活動力殊少興奮、國實銷依然觀望之故、昨大連桶油已跌近二十二日之非正式價為九十一元、成交三十桶、及大有餘廠油五十擔、價為六十四元五角、今日有豆子二百包、豆餅五十塊運小呂宋、</p>
<h3>疋頭　國布銷路仍殷　東疋白貨猛跌</h3>
<p>國布　昨因粵港幫需貨仍殷、故雖東疋跌價、國布屹立不動、白貨漂染布價均平穩、本街成交坯布·精布漂染布·三百餘件、粵港幫辦怡和粗布·申新·永安細布細斜·色布·色斜·二百數十件、閩幫辦線呢·嗶嘰·綸昌藍布等貨一百餘件、布廠八九月份期貨漸有做開、坯布粗布等五六百件、德豐·慶豐·大緯·新一·等廠期貨斜紋絨先後均有開出、北路煙臺等幫已裝出數批、</p>
<p>東布　因月底將屆、同業銀根奇緊、白貨跌勢益盛、昨中檔各牌細布每疋續降一元之譜、高檔·龍頭細布新棧單跌七角半、售開二十七元七角半、老棧單尤無人顧問、軋落二元許、後市喊售二十五元七角半、四君子嗶嘰比較還堅、晨市收盤八角四分半、後市角四分左右、</p>
<h3>夏令棉毛貨　——大都已成過去——</h3>
<p>（白嗶嘰）不論厚薄好壞、柳條紮色、　　下跌、豐裕牌子狂跌尤烈、蓋實銷已過也、</p>
<p>（白直貢）英檔高製頭號、貨趨勢較妥、因氏枯薄、執貨者不欲急於削價脫手、其下檔及條子白直貢、因申織品甚多、市價日下、</p>
<p>（派力司）因到存充斥、本廠貨生產供過於求、連續跌價已有二旬、昨來依然困頓軟弱、雖特別削價、亦少人問津、素色比條子更劣、</p>
<p>（萬列鼎）趨勢較之其他夏令呢絨各貨為佳、市銷不噁、白·藏·青灰·顏色格外見俏、因其實銷不絕、市貨毋多故耳、昨普通英製、貨每碼依然剪售二十七八元、</p>
<p>（蔴膠布）真貨全蔴者、祇出樣版拆貨幫略有居存、價始終堅挺、三江蔴膠布、因價飛漲猛烈、顧客指定銳減、致前買方所購進者俱有餘存、行情回疲數角一碼、本廠沖貨臘線織成者、市銷因之突增、然因各家出品太多、充沛於市、售價刻皆甩跌矣、</p>
<p>（白帆布）日貨缺乏、市上流通、俱為要廠貨、因其幅寬同是三十六寸、價比日貨為便宜近為紗廉本輕、價多賤落、</p>
<p>（黃斜紋）趨勢良好、因其廠貨出品不多、在西舶來品進口奇缺、而其需銷不弱、以致售盤穩立、在近日呢絨類紗織品中、可謂最占優勢者也、茶綠色亦佳、需供平衡、</p>
<p>（羽紗呢）合銷於中服者、步見軟化、合銷於西裝者、略形轉好、然較之旬日前趨勢、則亦莫不下降矣、巴勒呢走銷與羽紗呢相仿、但因質堅硬、多生毛紡織、故絕少有做華服聞、目下夏銷將過、大半已不若前之缺俏、</p>
<h3>南北貨　大粒圓步升</h3>
<p>雜路桂圓、存底本薄、而到貨無　、致大粒貨日見稀缺、查觀方手貨亦已不多、故行盤前後妤起二十元之多、惟中小粒以需要有限、較為半定、新漳枝登場有期</p>
<p>首批新漳州枝、因漳州及鼓浪嶼間交通停滯、致延遲到申、昨據客函報稱、八月一日可望恢復、如是則下月初旬當可運申雲、</p>
<h3>煤炭　白煤去路呆滯　囤戶吃虧不少</h3>
<p>白煤行情、近日來市氣益形衰頹、本街交易既冷落如恒、漸東口岸受軍事影響、去胃停滯、故行情難免步步回降、安南白煤、同業自車、已喊兩百零六元、暗市尚有虛頭、老貨國戶吃虧不少、形呈疲莫能與氣象、</p>
<h3>五金　會司鐵行情仍堅　惟實銷不暢</h3>
<p>百磅美會司鐵交易、近因南洋幫無辦、天津幫尠購進、兼之寗波·溫州·泉州·及長江路客商、亦稀納胃、實銷不暢、雖本街製　廠·玩具廠·及印刷廠·時見搜購、然為數殊微、對之整個市面、未許樂觀、然因來源受阻、滬存不豐、故市象雖蕭條、而人心仍激昂、行情有仍告堅挺、刻市如二百磅新鋼廠貨每箱沽一百五十五元、老鋼廠貨每箱則需一百六十五元、二百磅狹條鐵亦售一百四十元左右、</p>

<p>美總統遊歷（二）</p>
<p>美總統格蘭脫，歷任八年，在未膺總統之前，正值南北花旗互相攻擊之時，總統身列戎行，出則擐甲執兵，所向披靡，入則運籌決策，悉各機宜。及其為總統也，又復專事息兵務農，講信修睦，蓋不特禁賣買黑奴一事，足以使人欽佩，而德政之在人耳目者，亦不乏卓卓之名。此次退休之後，不辭勞瘁，遊歷各國，以詳觀風土人情之異，特產地氣之殊，前在香港，滬上之人，已不少引領望之者，前抵滬之時，在碼頭迎接者，人以萬計。聞總統留滬若干日，將至京覽皇居之宏麗，輦下之繁華，然後命駕返國。滬上中外官商，日夕謀所以樂之。而總統有時徒步至浦灘，觀玩景物。總統不自尊而人尊之，人之所以尊之者，亦不以其有可尊之德而後尊之。爰為之贊曰：「赫赫美國，疇惟主之。南北互搆，疇惟馭之。踐跡八載，脫然去之。游歷萬國，羣焉譽之。駐蹕春申，幸獲覩之。風采奕奕，慨乎慕之。載言簪筆，為之賦之。」</p>

<p>小談</p>
<h3>偏愛之心</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>一位虛心的爸爸來信說：</p>
<p>「　不敏，亦忝爲四個子女的父親，對於家庭敎育，素不敢漠視，可是能吾够得上做父親的資格，却不能自斷。然至少不　「即不知做父母，亦不會做父母。」</p>
<p>「觀上文，我好像有點够得上做父親的資格了，但自覺無形中對子女往往要發生偏心（分極愛，愛，與不愛。）有時頗思糾正這種思想，因爲深切地感到父母與子女關係之密切，決不能如交朋友之可隨意取捨。偏愛會引起極不良的影響尤其是在子女衆多與有前妻與後妻的家庭中。」</p>
<p>偏愛之心，可說是「人皆有之」的；要絕對避免，恐怕是不可能。不過做父母的人，在敎育子女的事上，應該有一種遠大的眼光，以爲未來的世界培植有用的人材爲永久的目標，以養成子女健全的人格爲鵠的；這樣」來，對於未來一代的善良天性，自然不忍予以絲毫的破壞或摧殘了。</p>
<p>對於子女有所偏愛的父母，應該明白偏愛的害處，竭力　　偏愛之心，至少不使在外表的行動上表現出來。</p>
<p>這需要良好的修養，需要應付子女的智識，需要了解兒童心理。這是不容易的，可是爲了下一代的人類的幸福，我們應該這樣做！</p>
<p>職業</p>
<h3>重逢</h3>
<p>— 嚴正</p>
<p>偶然在一個麵館裏碰到了三年不見的母校裏的C先生。</p>
<p>點頭招呼之後，我馬上發見C先生正是這個麵館的老板。我心裏詫異着，嘴裏却又不便問他。</p>
<p>這時，一個的摸十一二歲的孩子把我要的陽春麵搬來了。他用一對烏黑的眼珠骨碌　地偷看我。</p>
<p>「這是我的第二個男孩子。」C先生指着那孩子對我說。「我們什麼都自己來。」</p>
<p>我仔細地瞧那瞧孩子，又望望四周：在門口板桌上揑麵團的麻臉的女人；在爐邊撈麵條約少年；拖着兩條小辮子，蹲在鉛桶旁洗滌碗筷的小女孩；都有着和C先生一模一樣的面型。</p>
<p>「難得！難得！」我羨　地說。「但是請告訴我，爲什麼您不在母校裏敎書了？」</p>
<p>「你問爲什麼！難道你沒有聽到……？」他圓瞪着炯炯的眼反問着。</p>
<p>「聽是聽到一點的，可是不詳細。」我說。</p>
<p>「校長要過官癮。幾個敎員唯利是圖，聽到有雙俸可拿，都留下了；只有B先生和我決定不幹！」</p>
<p>「B先生往內地去了。我因爲有這麼多孩子，只能留在這裏。目前找個相當的地位眞是不容易。這樣就脫下長衫，幹起這買賣來了！」</p>
<p>「像先生那樣眞難得！眞難得！」我衷心地稱讚着。</p>
<p>「開頭雇了一個會揑麵團的人。但當我們自己也會了時，我們便把他辭歇了。你看，還不差吧？這樣生活是可以過下去了。」</p>
<p>生意的確很不差。這時店堂裏已坐滿了人。門外還有進來站着，伸長　子朝裏望，找位置的。</p>
<p>C先生說聲「少陪，」就跑過去。我聽到他在招呼那些主顧：「請等一等，馬上就好！馬上就好：」</p>
<p>我囫圇地吞完麵。C先生的第二個男孩子伶俐地遞來熱面巾。我笑笑接着，問他：「你幾歲了？」</p>
<p>「十二歲。」</p>
<p>在櫃台上付錢的時候，C先生再三的說：「自己人不要客氣了。」但我終於把錢扔在櫃上，頭也不回的走了。我的背後飛來了他的大聲的笑。</p>
<p>在路上，我的腦海裏元是浮現着C先生的一對炯炯的眼，我的耳際元是鳴響着他的大聲的笑。突然我的嘴脣翕動起來，我唸出那雖然陳舊，却是常新的句子：「富貴小能淫，貧賤不能移，威武不能屈。」</p>
<p>這麼唸着，我的步子輕快起來。</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第四章　　種推想</p>
<p>倪金壽的希望並沒有實現。他希望那老媽子有什麼更重要的情報，結果却等於零。吳媽是個四十歲以外的揚州人，　胖胖的臉兒，配着一副不相稱的小嘴小眼，正中央還聳起了一個朝天鼻孔，如果攝在膠片上面，祇要這尊相映上銀幕，不開口也够使　衆們發笑。不但伊的嘴臉吿訴我伊的腦筋不會十分　敏，因爲伊身體上指肪的過剩，伊的動作也很笨拙。當伊蹣　地走進來後，兩雙狹縫的眼睛抵向我們三個人亂　，兩雙手也沒有安放的場所，拉住了那件深藍色的海昌布老式短衫的角，不住地　　。</p>
<p>伊的答語　面十句　倒有七八句「不知道」。其實伊抵來了兩個月，對於主人的複雜的生活方式，的確不能夠領會。伊所知道德事實，也是我們早知道的；比較有價值的，就是伊證實了上一天十八日晚上，伊和金梅吃夜飯時，那趙伯雄的確來過。伊對於趙伯雄的狀態，有過這樣幾句描摹：</p>
<p>「他的眼睛突出了，臉兒也鐵板板的，問話時怪聲怪氣，說話又小多。他聽說王小姐不在，鼻子裏哼了一聲，便氣冲冲回出去。我給他一嚇，一根魚骨險些兒鯁住在喉嚨裏！」</p>
<p>此外伊對於余甘棠的行動也補充一種新的證明：</p>
<p>伊說道：「在大前天十六日晚上吃過夜飯，我出去買洋火回來時，看見余少爺在門口偷倫地張望。我招呼了他。他好像吃了一嚇，忙叫我不要聲張。他還給我一張鈔票，我沒有拿—我不敢拿。」</p>
<p>霍桑問道：「他可曾向你說什麼話？」</p>
<p>吳媽道：「他問我王小姐在不在。我吿訴他不在。他又間趙少爺這幾天來不來。我說常來。他點點頭，便又悄悄地走開。」（五五）</p>
<h3>七大缺點</h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>人類當然免不了有缺點，所以每個人的生命中總是常會發生各種錯誤的情狀。最近，有一西方作家擬定人類遍有之七大缺點，茲特譯之於後，以爲吾輩有所警悟。</p>
<p>（一）把個人的進步，限定於使他人墮落的原則之下。</p>
<p>（二）對於不能改變或不能糾正的事情，常常自討煩惱。</p>
<p>（三）堅持凡事之不可爲，是由於缺乏不能成就的能力。</p>
<p>（四）置平凡的事情於不顧，而一心想求獲取偉大事業的成功。</p>
<p>（五）不能從讀書的習慣中，使我們的思想及腦力有所發展。</p>
<p>（六）企求逼迫他人能信任我，而於生活方面則希望他人無所超越於我。</p>
<p>（七）缺乏養成儲蓄金錢的習慣之能力。</p>
<h3>教員的重</h3>
<p>— 李嗚皋作</p>
<h3>有天父沒有？</h3>
<p>我們前兩次在本報提到物買世界　的　災，水災，地震，山　種種天然的災難，都不能證明沒有上帝。人類因爲這種種災難的經騐，產生了防禦的方法，以及控制的能力，反足以證明有一位上帝，正在造就人類，爲人類　幸福。現在我們要討論到一動物世界　調的困難一了：</p>
<p>（二）動物世界裏的困難：人們常說在動物中所有的競爭恐　，疼痛苦難，和疾病死亡的盛行，頗足表示上帝的殘酷和無情。我們也聽說大自然是一片大　塲，常有某種動物獲取而毀滅另一種動物的事，正與俗諺所說「大魚吃小魚，小魚吃虫」的話相符合。不錯，在動物中，尤其在較高尙而多有敏感的動物中，確有苦難和疼痛。但並不像我們所想的那　重大，那麼常有。也不要以爲動物所受的苦，和我們人類所受的苦是一樣。因爲我們人類有一種自覺，是動物沒有的。我們人類所有的記憶力和想像力，都比動物的程度大得多。而且人類有許多痛苦，是因爲對於痛苦的預想過於强烈化。例如有人患牙痛的病，他會預想到拔牙的痛，會比牙痛還要厲害。動物似乎沒有道樣的預想，所以　們的痛苦，也就不及人類的大。</p>
<p>如果說痛苦在自然世界裏佔有優勢，這話也不盡然。就我們隨時眼見的而論，快樂終比痛苦多。例如樹上的雀島，田野的羔羊和野兎，常是跳躍自如地生活着的。即使在大自然　，有爭門和敵對的事，但動物方面的互助互愛，也足以抵償了。</p>
<p>在自然界中使人發生殘酷感想的，似乎只是死亡的問題了。但死亡本身却是使人類和動物界達到進步的一個條件，如果沒有死亡，就沒有新生。如果活的人，永遠活着，則生活的幸福，只限於少數人享受，不能散給許多後代的人了。</p>
<p>現代利學給我們的敎訓說：大自然裏的痛苦，有它的意義。這種痛苦，是獲取安全，生存，和保留動物界的門徑，也是在有機世界大體系裏的一種必不可少的要素，藉以滿足神的一種偉大仁　的目標。這一切在人看爲是痛苦的現象，都是上帝爲宇宙安排約計劃，在我們沒有隨便說出仁智的上帝是不善良以前，總應當略事躊躇，抱一點存疑的態度，免　「盲人說　」之譏、（二七日再登）（本篇請參考廣學會出版之有天父沒有）讀者如欲群細研究，請函詢上海愛文義路三五一號文字佈道社，當有詳細答復。</p>

<h3>電影史上又一新貢獻　自動變音器</h3>
<p>— 先德</p>
<p>一般人對於外國電影，總感不能十分瞭解，惟一的原因是語言的不通。因此有許多人正在埋頭研究，設法改良　。直至最近好萊塢有一位名叫吉爾培、拉脫（Gilbertwright）的製片家劇作家兼物理學家，費了二年的心血，發明了一隻沙拿伏克斯（Sonovox）的自動更變聲音的機器，於是解決了這個難題。至於他研究這機器的</p>
<p>動機</p>
<p>是這樣的：有一次拉脫氏監製一張影片，其中有一段情節是一個殺人者，乘了火車逃逸的時候，車輪需要發出一種「你殺了她！你殺了她」的譴責聲，依照普通的方法，那只要一方面收錄車輪的聲音，一方面加入所需的人聲就行了。但拉脫却不以爲然，他希望輪子本身能够發出那種需要的聲音，許多工程師都以爲是不可能的，然而拉脫靠他聲學電學的智識，終於達到了目的。這架機器的</p>
<p>外形</p>
<p>是非常簡單而且精巧的，只有一隻像留聲機器一般的音箱，和用電綫連在上而的二塊餅乾形的振動版而已。至於內部構造和原理，因爲不能以三言兩語所能說盡的，所以這　也不再加討論了。這架機器雖然外貌簡單然而牠的</p>
<p>功用</p>
<p>却很廣，他能把你嘴　所說的意大利語，變成英語：把你沙啞的歌喉，變成響亮；因此用了這種變音器之後，無論何人，都能聽懂外國伶人用他（她）自己的語言而演的戲了，銀幕上也不再需要任何的說明了。無疑這機器在電影史上，會引起像無聲電影進步到有聲電影一樣的大變動。這種。</p>
<p>變音</p>
<p>器，除了應用在電影方面以外，還可替因疾病或意外不幸而不能發音的人服務，使他們和旁人一般地能够用嘴來表達各種意見。所以這也是一種聾啞者之福音。</p>

<p>是日翻高之腔甚多，得彩不少。休息五分之後，桑園會開塲，自羅氏女上念引子起，减去秋胡改扮唱下一塲，省時間也。陳麗芳扮演羅氏，唱做純學程硯秋，水袖工夫極好，可以亂眞，嗓音較第一日打泡戲唱女起解時寬亮，唱做皆圓到之至。譚富英扮秋胡上唱「秋胡打馬奔家鄉」，流水板，聽其嗓音，亦較前更形通快，「秋胡他把良心喪」之倒元板，唱老調，確守規矩，接唱西陂元板，頗有好腔，音既寬洪句句聽得淸楚，「我勸他回家他不往」，一句，他字一口氣唱下，氣足神完，對唱快板各段，亦熟極而流。「大不該在桑園調戲他」翻高唱，唱得最爲精彩；富英此戲，唱做都好，是日做得活潑有神氣，極受臺下歡迎。細聽他唱此戲，毫無時調悲哀衰收之音，眞不同凡響，吾最贊成此點，旣不是悲劇，何用哀音，况秋胡掛黑三髯口，年紀原不甚老，而題目是戲妻，更用不着悲哀也。富英知劇情，目知川音矣。惟吾以爲富英有此好嗓音，宜再將音韻作進一步之研究，今舉三字，似覺不妥者：一，「哄娘行」之哄字，口太開，收音不淸，二，「他不往」之往字，使腔之後，韻音不應大變今聽其江陽轍之字腹，凡轉變數音，此唱法之大忌。吾聽富英十年前有此小疵，疑爲嗓音未復所致，今嗓音通快矣，氣分充足矣，何不急謀改之？三，「調戲他調字，陽平聲，不宜使「凡」字高音，此與捉放遭禍殃之遭字陰平聲字面不同，不可一律使「凡」字音也。然而此處實應用高音以增氣勢，依吾愚見，調字改爲「要」字上聲字，則合用高音矣。打魚殺家上塲，已近十一時，因時間侷促，大家馬前，好似搶了一齣戲，茲省筆墨，不論。</p>

Only the Soviet Embassy, although its building was once destroyed, has recently been renovated, and all staff members are still working in the embassy as usual. Other embassies, such as the French Embassy, have moved to a British store on the south bank, which is very crowded due to the large number of people. The buildings of the British Embassy and Consulate have been almost completely destroyed and have been temporarily moved to the British naval canteen on the south bank. The facilities are very simple. The German Embassy has temporarily rented civilian houses on the mountain for use. Only the US Embassy, because it was originally located on the south bank, was fortunate to avoid the trouble of relocation. (Havas dispatch of the 24th)</p>

<h3>Foreign Authorities in Tianjin Consider Transfer of Telephone Control</h3>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>After Konoe's Inauguration in Japan</h3>
<p>It is reported that after the inauguration of the Japanese Konoe Cabinet, the first order regarding the military operations against China was to withdraw the naval forces attacking the coastal areas of Ningbo and Santu'ao in China and concentrate them in Taiwan and Hainan Island, awaiting further orders. It is also claimed that after Britain rejected Germany's proposal for a negotiated peace, the secret diplomatic relations between Germany, Italy, Japan, and Spain seem to have made rapid progress. It is said that Germany and Italy are urging Japan and Spain to join the war against Britain as soon as possible, as Germany and Italy most want to use the Japanese navy not only to disrupt British influence in the Far East but also to divert American attention from Europe. Therefore, observers generally believe that Japan's recent withdrawal of its navy from the Chinese coast is another gesture of Japan's preparation to participate in the European war. This is a dispatch from Hong Kong. Whether it is based on facts remains to be judged. However, according to Japan's recent situation, the Hong Kong report, while not necessarily a statement of facts, is an observation that is not far from reasonable.</p>
<p>It took Konoe six days to organize a cabinet after resigning from Minai, and it was only yesterday that he held a private ceremony and announced his inauguration. Since taking office, Konoe has not made any systematic positive statements regarding his policy guidelines, as of the time of this report. The questions and answers between Konoe and the press corps recorded in yesterday's newspaper are only fragmentary and insufficient to understand the general outline of his policies. Regarding foreign policy, what he said was even more superficial and unfounded. The so-called seeking an effective solution to the China Incident, the so-called adjusting relations with Germany, Italy, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and the so-called urgently seeking to get rid of the historical dependence on Britain and the United States, and so on, are as empty as zero. Of course, we do not believe that Konoe's aspirations are almost equal to zero. However, there were various remote and recent reasons for Minai's resignation this time, and the fact that the army suddenly expressed that it would no longer continue to cooperate, forcing the Minai cabinet to resign immediately, is undeniably abrupt in its actions and momentum. Therefore, although Konoe has lofty aspirations and thorough planning, his sudden acceptance of the order to form a cabinet is undeniably premature in terms of timing and preparation. The slow cabinet formation and the superficial remarks are all signs of prematurity!</p>
<p>The premature Konoe cabinet faces numerous difficulties it is currently encountering. Since it does not have a well-thought-out plan, how can we expect it to be decisive in its command? As the Hong Kong dispatch reports, it is unbelievable that the withdrawal of the Japanese navy from Ningbo and Santu'ao is a strategic move under Konoe's policy. Foreign Minister Matsuoka has only just taken office and has not yet begun to take action internationally. It is again unconvincing to say that the secret diplomatic relations between Germany, Italy, Japan, and Spain seem to have made rapid progress. The withdrawal of the navy from the Chinese coast and concentration on Taiwan and Hainan Island is probably a fact. Before any positive statements are made on the international stage, this fact alone is insufficient to be regarded as an effective gesture of preparing to participate in the European war. Therefore, upon examination, the Hong Kong dispatch is merely an observation rather than a report.</p>
<p>Then, how can we see that such an observation is not far from reasonable? Looking at Konoe's intentions: one is that he definitely wants to quickly resolve the so-called China Incident. Therefore, in various offensives, he inevitably aspires to make rapid progress. To seek effectiveness, he will at the same time abandon what is unnecessary and correct what is ineffective. Therefore, the partial abandonment of military occupation points and lines is inevitable. Two is that he definitely wants to gain something from this European war period. Therefore, towards Germany, Italy, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, he will definitely reverse the previous diplomatic stance. He will strive to be strong and will also not hesitate to make any kind of concessions. The so-called another gesture of preparing to participate in the European war is a representation that will inevitably be embellished as much as possible, but its central consciousness still aspires to achieve success through this representation alone. As for the actual participation in the European war, it is a matter to be reconsidered after diplomacy has completely failed and is definitely not what is being discussed today at the beginning of Konoe's rise to power. Three is that he definitely regrets that within his country, for the past three years of the invasion of China, the authority has been inconsistent, and there have been many obstacles. Therefore, he aspires to merge into one party and concentrate power in one entity, so that major undertakings can be carried out easily. Is the so-called new political system really a problem of the system itself? From pressing aspirations to making realistic plans, this is where the outline of Konoe's ambitions lies. We do not despise such ambitions, but we understand that the people who have presided over the national administration in Japan in recent years have successively been defeated and resigned, not because of a lack of subjective ambition but because of a lack of objective conditions for realizing their ambitions. The so-called objective conditions are not in Konoe's pocket!</p>
<h3>The United States Will Adopt a Positive Stance on the Far East; Vinson Urges Congress to Consider Preliminary Work for Fortifying Guam</h3>
<p>Washington: A responsible member of the US Congress recently told a reporter from the Associated Press that the United States may immediately adopt a positive stance on the Far East issue and the anti-American incident in Shanghai. On the other hand, many members of Congress, wanting the United States to concentrate its efforts on building national defense to resist aggression, do not seem to want the US relationship with the Far East to become serious. The consideration given by congressional and government leaders to the Far East diplomatic situation due to the recent Shanghai incident also does not indicate that the United States will adopt a special attitude or action towards the Far East. However, the US government's attitude towards the Far East at this time is clearly different from the time four months ago when the US administration seemed to want to ease relations with Japan, and is tending towards a more proactive aspect. Japan's reorganization of its cabinet and its clear trend towards totalitarianism have greatly changed the US Congress's attitude towards Japan. The overall situation may come to a head during the debate on the Guam fortification proposal at the next congressional meeting. Well-informed congressional members said that Representative Vinson, chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, said yesterday that the US Navy intends to raise various improvement issues at the next congressional meeting. It is also reported in political circles that the Navy is currently planning to carry out various improvements to its defenses and the construction of Guam in order to expand the use of Guam. (Associated Press dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>Washington: Representative Vinson, chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, declared yesterday that he hoped that the administration would present the preliminary work of considering the fortification of Guam at the next meeting. Vinson's announcement has attracted attention here, as it is believed that the matter will be discussed in the current meeting without any significant delay. A Navy spokesman has notified Congress that the fortification of Guam, 1,300 miles southeast of Japan, is an important military step in US Pacific defenses. However, Congress has repeatedly opposed this proposal, which has been criticized by the Japanese Navy Department. Vinson declared yesterday that he expects the proposal to cause a great debate in Congress. Minnesota Republican Representative Maas told the House Military Affairs Committee that he believes the committee should immediately hear the proposal. Maas said, "If we wait until the next meeting to discuss this proposal, we may need to obtain permission from Japan." (Associated Press dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<p>Washington: The United States is currently brewing a secret movement to legally restrict new policies so that they cannot manipulate the new national defense expenditure of 14 billion US dollars for political purposes. According to a visit by an International News Service reporter, the movement has been initiated by Democratic senators who oppose Roosevelt's third term. When the last unexpected defense fund of 4.8 billion US dollars in the big defense expenditure is sent to the Senate for discussion, the above movement may be made public.

<h3>Ningbo Defense Commander Announces Martial Law in Ningbo; Chinese Forces Counterattack Rapidly; Highway Transportation Will Be Restored Soon</h3>
<p>This newspaper reports: According to reliable sources in the shipping industry, the Ningbo Police Department, under the order of the Defense Command, has implemented martial law in Ningbo from today, to be handled by the police chief. In addition to complying with the order, the police chief has specially promulgated martial law regulations, which were posted yesterday. Article 1: Prohibiting acts that hinder military work and illegal organizations and associations, and illegal speech; Article 2: Prohibiting reliance on mobs, riots, indirect disruption of military operations, and the order of the rear; Article 3: Prohibiting unauthorized recruitment and collection of weapons; Article 4: Prohibiting non-military personnel from carrying weapons in parades and from privately possessing military weapons; Article 5: Prohibiting impersonation of military personnel by wearing military uniforms, etc.</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to Chinese sources, when the Japanese troops landed in Zhenhai and on both banks of the Yong River in an attempt to occupy Ningbo, there were only two divisions of Chinese troops defending the Ningbo area. The Chinese military authorities immediately requisitioned all public buses, trucks, and cars on the highways south of the Yangtze River to transport reinforcements to the Ningbo area. Notices were posted at various bus stations stating, "Due to a shortage of gasoline, public buses are temporarily suspended." In fact, these vehicles were all used to transport troops. They were able to reach Ningbo in time because of continuous travel day and night. Due to the Chinese counterattack, the Japanese troops were driven back to their warships. It is expected that the public buses on all highways will soon return to their original condition. (Reuters dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<p>Three Japanese Planes Shot Down</p>
<p>Ningbo: In this Battle of Zhenhai, in addition to capturing Japanese soldiers, the Chinese troops also captured a Japanese merchant ship, Daiyumaru, which has now been destroyed and sunk in the mouth of the Yong River by the Chinese. Also, during the fierce battle, three Japanese planes were shot down in the skies above Chendong, catching fire and crashing into the sea. (Dispatch of the 24th)</p>

<h3>Widespread Rumors that Song Ziwen Will Remain in the United States Temporarily</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Although Song Ziwen and Chen Guangfu are the most popular candidates for Minister of Economic Warfare, it is uncertain whether the ministry will be established in the short term. It is rumored that Song Ziwen will remain in Washington and succeed Hu Shi as the US ambassador. It is expected that Hu Shi will soon return to China and take office as the President of the Academia Sinica. After the Chinese embassies in the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, and Belgium were closed due to recent developments in Europe, several key Chinese diplomats are currently on their way back to Chongqing and will join the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, it has not yet been decided what positions they will hold. (Reuters dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<h3>Transfer of Archives by Shanghai Municipal Council; Further Protests from External Sources</h3>
<p>Chongqing – It was previously reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had protested against the Shanghai Municipal Council, which was planning to hand over archives formerly entrusted to it by the Shanghai Municipal Government's Land Bureau, to the puppet regime. It is now reported that the transfer of these archives has already been implemented. As a result, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has once again lodged a serious protest with the embassies of relevant countries, stating that the Shanghai Municipal Council, in possessing these archives, was entrusted by the Shanghai Municipal Government. Therefore, it should only return the archives to the entrusting party and must not transfer them to any other organization, especially not to the puppet Shanghai Municipal Council. This action is illegal and not only greatly affects the rights of Chinese and foreign merchants and residents in Shanghai, but also betrays the responsibility of safekeeping entrusted by the Chinese government. It is also stated that the aforementioned transfer of archives has no legal effect, and the Chinese government reserves all rights concerning this matter. (24th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Circuit Court System; Implemented in Seven Provinces; Cases Tried and Concluded Promptly for the Convenience of the People</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Since the Judicial Yuan issued an order to the higher courts of various provinces to implement the wartime circuit court system, reports have been received successively. It is estimated that seven provinces have implemented the system, including Hubei, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Anhui, Henan, and Zhejiang. (Shanxi Province is divided into ten districts, but the implementation date has been repeatedly postponed due to the fact that the appointed circuit trial judges have not yet arrived). The jurisdictional areas of the circuit courts in each province are as follows: Hubei is divided into four districts, Guangdong into two districts, Jiangsu into six districts, Jiangxi into two districts, Anhui into two districts, Henan into three districts, and Shanghai is one district. The duration of each circuit in each district is determined by the size of the area and the ease of transportation, ranging from one month to three months. Since the trial implementation, circuit courts in various provinces have been able to deeply penetrate the war zones and try and conclude cases promptly, which is very convenient for the people.

<h3>New Changes on the Map of Europe; United States Will Refuse to Recognize; Welles Condemns Soviet Tactics; Says Intent is to Annihilate the Three Baltic States</h3>
<p>Washington – Acting Secretary of State Welles yesterday strongly condemned the Soviet Union's absorption of the three small Baltic states of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania, and stated that the United States will refuse to recognize the new changes on the map of Europe. Welles also criticized the use of aggression or threats of force to achieve national goals, and stated that unless all countries return to the basis of peace and the rule of law, culture cannot be preserved. "In the past few days, the political independence and territorial integrity of the three small Baltic states have been intentionally annihilated in a deliberate manner by one of the strongest neighbors of these three countries. This process will be completed quickly. When the people of these three republics first gained independence and democracy, the American people watched the admirable progress of their self-governance with deep sympathy. The policy of this country is well known to the world. The American people oppose acts of plunder, whether carried out by force or threats of force. The American people also oppose any powerful country interfering in the internal affairs of any small, independent country. These principles are the foundation of the relations between the twenty-one independent republics of the New World (referring to North and South America). The United States government has consistently adhered to these principles, because the American people deeply believe that unless these principles can be consistently adhered to, there will be no reasonable, fair, and lawful rule, in other words, the foundation of modern culture cannot be preserved." (24th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington – Yesterday, the United States condemned the Soviet Union's recent annexation of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania, believing that this was a wrong method and a threat of force used by the Soviet side to eliminate the three Baltic republics. Just as the Russian spokesperson in London proposed holding a tripartite meeting of Britain, Russia, and the United States to resist Japan's expansion of power in the Far East, Undersecretary of State Welles was launching a fierce attack on aggression. Officials stated that Welles' remarks, approved by President Roosevelt, would be a sign that Russia and the United States would not be able to cooperate in Asia or elsewhere. Welles also took the opportunity to warn the Spanish government not to use the break in relations with Chile as an excuse to interfere in any republic in the Americas. (24th International dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington – Welles' comments condemning the Soviet Union's absorption of the three Baltic states surprised political observers here, as it was generally believed that US-Soviet relations had gradually improved, as evidenced by the recent US approval of the shipment of machinery and other equipment to the Soviet Union. It is believed that Welles must have consulted with President Roosevelt before making these remarks, but it is unclear whether he informed Hull. (24th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Soviet Union to Convene Supreme Soviet to Approve Annexation of Three Countries</p>

It is reported that delegations from the three Baltic states have already departed for Moscow to formally request the Soviet government to take steps for unification. Molotov may reiterate the Soviet government's general attitude towards the international situation in his annual report. (24th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Riga – The Lithuanian Parliament has decided to send a 20-member delegation, led by President Paleckis, to Moscow to prepare for the incorporation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union. The Parliament also resolved to nationalize banks, large enterprises, and land holdings exceeding 75 acres, and sent a telegram of greetings to Soviet dictator Stalin. (24th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Riga – The Latvian Parliament yesterday appointed a delegation to go to Moscow to request the Soviet Union's Supreme Soviet to allow the country to join the Soviet Union. The delegation consists of 20 people, led by Prime Minister Kirhenšteins, and will depart within a few days. (24th Haitong dispatch)</p>
<p>Riga – When the Lithuanian Parliament met yesterday, the first item discussed was the nationalization of banks and industries, which was unanimously approved. All banks and large industries will be nationalized immediately, but this bill does not affect the right to own houses and businesses. At the same time, the Parliament appointed an 11-member committee, chaired by the Minister of Justice, to revise the Soviet Russian constitution within two weeks to adapt it to Lithuania. At the suggestion of the Minister of Justice, a 20-member delegation was appointed to petition Moscow for the annexation of Lithuania to Soviet Russia. The delegation includes Vice President Paleckis, four current cabinet members, and other important figures. The Parliament also resolved to send telegrams of greetings to Stalin, Molotov, and Kalinin. A grand demonstration was held after the meeting. (24th Haitong dispatch)</p>
<p>Moscow – Since the parliaments of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania decided to establish Soviet regimes and requested the Soviet Union to incorporate each country into the Soviet Republics, rallies have been held throughout the Soviet Union, and the working masses have unanimously congratulated the nations of the three countries, while also expressing their welcome to the incorporation of the three countries into the Soviet Union.

<p>Three Ambassadors Petition British Foreign Office Not to Recognize New Communist Parliaments</p>
<p>Washington – Welles, in his capacity as acting Secretary of State, made a formal statement in the press briefing room, condemning the Soviet Union's absorption of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania as an act of intentional annihilation. He stated that although the three countries had voted to join the Soviet Union, the United States would continue to recognize the ambassadors of the three countries to the United States as envoys of independent governments now under duress. The assets of the three countries in the United States, totaling 970,000 US dollars, have now been placed under a license system of the US Treasury Department to prevent possible confiscation. (24th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London – British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax yesterday received protests from the ambassadors to Britain of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania against the unanimous vote of the Communist parliaments of the three countries to incorporate them into the Soviet Union. The protest notes were similarly worded. The ambassadors of the three countries stated that they would refuse to recognize the actions of the new Communist parliaments, and stated that the incorporation of their countries into the Soviet Union was solely due to the threat of foreign military occupation. The ambassadors' notes requested the British government not to recognize the merger of the Baltic states with the Soviet Union. The notes also cited various treaties in which the Soviet Union guaranteed the independence of the three countries. Lord Halifax agreed to reply to the ambassadors after the cabinet had studied the notes. Observers here believe that while the British Foreign Secretary expressed personal sympathy for the fate of the three countries, the ambassadors' actions would put Britain in a delicate position. The general demand here is to strengthen British-Soviet relations and weaken Berlin-Moscow relations. The ambassadors of the three countries stated that they hoped to enjoy the same status as the exiled governments of Poland, the Netherlands, Norway, and Czechoslovakia. Unofficial sources suggested last night that Britain would not recognize the incorporation of the three Baltic states into the Soviet Union, but doubted that Britain would grant any legal status to the embassies of the three exiled Baltic states.

<h3>Soviet Newspaper Commentary on the Annexation of the Three Countries</h3>
<p>Moscow – The Pravda newspaper commented that the resolution passed by the parliaments of Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia to establish Soviet regimes and request the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to incorporate each country into the Soviet Union, this resolution of the democratic representatives of the Baltic countries, truly represents the voices of the people of the three countries. Their common will has been expressed in the general election. They unanimously voted in favor of establishing Soviet regimes and rejoining the great Soviet Union. This can be confirmed by the mass rallies held in the three countries. The enthusiasm shown by the people of the three Baltic countries in the general election was unprecedented, and it was also the first time they could freely express their opinions. The people of the Baltic countries have freely decided their future destiny. They only had two options: one was to continue to be shackled by capitalism, and the other was to establish Soviet regimes. They have now made their final decision. The Soviet regime and socialism have won. The reasons why the people of the Baltic countries are willing to establish Soviet-style governments are: (1) Only the Soviet regime can guarantee national friendship and unity; (2) The Soviet regime represents the national policy of Lenin and Stalin; (3) Only the Soviet Union can free the working masses from unemployment and starvation; (4) Only the Soviet regime can unite all nations, develop the economy, and consolidate national defense. The people of the three countries demand the establishment of Soviet regimes and annexation to the Soviet Union. The people of the three countries now understand that their new governments truly represent the people. They have had painful experience with the corruption of the former governments. A new page has been opened in the history of the Baltic countries. The darkness of the past has been completely eliminated. Capitalist politicians, with the help of British bayonets, have transformed the three countries into bases for attacking the Soviet Union and began a fierce anti-Soviet movement. Imperialist lackeys such as Smetona only cared about their own interests and disregarded the future of the country. Therefore, the Baltic countries became even more impoverished and became backward countries in Europe. Dishonest petty-bourgeois politicians have done everything in their power to keep their countries away from the Soviet Union. They are extremely afraid of the news of the victory of socialist construction. They have used rumors and corrupt newspapers to spread unfounded rumors about the Soviet Union, but to no avail. The people of the Baltic countries have paid close attention to everything about the Soviet Union. Their love for the socialist country is profound. In oppression, their concept of building a Soviet regime has become even deeper. They have always remembered Lenin and Stalin, and at the same time firmly believe that only the Soviet Union is the true guarantee for small countries. When the Red Army entered, this sentiment was fully exposed. What they saw was not only representatives of the great Soviet Union, but also advanced elements who had received socialist culture. Therefore, their impression of the Soviet Union was even better. They believe that Soviet life is a new life, and the Soviet government is a new people's government. Everything that is most beneficial to the people is confirmed by the great Stalin Constitution. A glorious future has been determined. The people of the three countries will join hands with the people of the Soviet Union and move towards this goal together. So far, the great historical task has been completed. The people of the three countries have placed their future destiny in their own hands. They have expelled imperialist enslavement, overthrown the capitalist parasites who oppress the people, and at the same time returned the land to the people. More importantly, they have destroyed the bases of war and safeguarded the peace of their countries. The people of the Soviet Union unanimously welcome the emergence of these new Soviet republics. The borders of the Soviet Union have been further expanded, and the dawn of the Stalin Constitution has spread to new lands and new nations. This has strengthened the strength of our motherland. The Soviet Union warmly welcomes the resolutions of the parliaments of the three countries. Yesterday, at mass rallies, the people of the Soviet Union unanimously expressed their love for these new Soviet republics. At the same time, they are particularly satisfied with the victory of socialism and the wise policies of the Soviet government. They will always be loyal to Comrade Stalin, because Stalin's name is the power of communism. The people of the Soviet Union are very willing to help these new Soviet republics to get rid of the darkness of the past and build a socialist industry, culture, and a new life for the working masses. With the help of the Soviet Union, the talents of the three countries can be fully developed. They must understand the broad benefits of the Stalin Constitution for the masses. In these historically valuable days, the Stalin Constitution has proven its great power. The anniversary of November 25, 1936, will be forever etched in the hearts of people around the world. As Comrade Stalin said, "This document will prove that whatever the Soviet Union can achieve, other countries can also achieve." Today, we see that this achievement has been achieved by the Baltic Republics. Under the protection of the Stalin Constitution, the Soviet nation has become increasingly strong. The working masses of the world will certainly rejoice over this. (23rd TASS dispatch)</p>
<h3>New Latvian Government Prepares to Accuse Former President</h3>
<p>Stockholm – A traveler said that the new Latvian government will publicly accuse former President Ulmanis. In a recent demonstration in Riga, there was a motorcade with an empty coffin on which was written "Prepared for Ulmanis." Posters were pasted everywhere saying, "The dictator (referring to Ulmanis) robbed the people for six years." (24th Haitong dispatch)</p>
<h3>Pan-American Conference to Discuss Economic Cooperation Proposals; Joint Management Plan for Territories in the Western Hemisphere; Argentina Declares It Will Oppose</h3>
<p>New York – According to the New York Times correspondent in Washington, an organization capable of rising up and accepting any territory in the Americas belonging to a European country, if it attempts to transfer it to a non-American country, is rapidly taking shape. This issue will be the main subject of discussion at the Pan-American Conference. The signs are becoming increasingly clear that a draft of joint temporary management measures has been prepared as a basis for discussion. Countries such as Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, or Brazil will hesitate to impose restrictions on the fully authorized management, because the United States will inevitably control this action in the future if it is implemented. Therefore, several suggestions have been added to the current draft in order to alleviate this kind of concern. (24th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Havana – Argentina recently declared that it will oppose the collective management plan of the Pan-American Conference. This plan is to establish a collective management system by the American republics to manage European territories in the Western Hemisphere and prevent the intrusion of omnipotent forces into the Americas. This plan was proposed by the Peace Maintenance Committee of the Pan-American Conference, which is composed of representatives from Brazil, Venezuela, Panama, Ecuador, and Paraguay, and US Secretary of State Hull is the chairman of the committee.</p>
<p>(Five Points of the Plan)</p>
<p>The content of the plan is to organize a "Five-Nation Committee" to manage the French and Dutch territories in the Western Hemisphere, and includes the following main points: (1) The American countries reiterate that they do not recognize any military conquest in the Western Hemisphere, and do not recognize any direct or indirect transfer of sovereignty; (2) The American countries will engage in determining whether any change in the political status of any Western Hemisphere territory occupied since September 1, 1939, affects the independence, freedom, and activities of that territory; (3) If the American countries must take action to deal with these territories, the significance of this action is not an attempt by the American countries to expand their territory; (4) The American countries may return these territories under their management to their original rulers when they deem that it will not affect the security of the Americas. If these territories have the ability to self-govern, they should be allowed to declare independence; (5) When the American countries must take over these territories, they should be managed by a committee composed of the United States, Cuba, Colombia, Venezuela, and Brazil. This committee may request the use of force to manage these lands if necessary. Two hours after Hull discussed with the Argentine representative, Podolmiro, it was heard that Argentina expressed opposition to this collective management plan, but has not yet put forward an equivalent plan. However, it is rumored that a plan is expected to be put forward this week.</p>
<p>(Secret Meeting Held Today)</p>
<p>In addition, there has been no disagreement on issues such as neutrality, prevention of sabotage activities, and economic cooperation. The first public report of the meeting stated that various plans to accelerate the work of the meeting were passed by only one vote. The case that all proposals must be submitted by noon on July 25 was passed by eleven votes to ten votes. The first secret plenary meeting will be held at 5 p.m. tomorrow, and the second public plenary meeting will be held at 4 p.m. on Saturday at the request of Colombia. The Peace Maintenance Committee has voted a vote of confidence in Hull, so Hull will work with the Secretary-General of the Conference, Cuban representative Saraya, to deploy the proposals to be studied by various committees. The communiqué also stated that US Assistant Secretary of State Berle has provided a draft resolution on economic cooperation, which may be submitted for discussion at the meeting.</p>
<p>(Bolivia Suggests Alliance)</p>
<p>According to reliable non-Bolivian sources, the Bolivian representative is drafting a resolution on the defense of the American continent. It is heard that the continental defense bill drafted by the Bolivian representative stipulates close cooperation between the American countries, and its nature is nothing less than an alliance of the American countries. However, reliable sources say that this draft resolution may only become a resolution in form. The Colombian representative stated that any international agreement in the Americas on continental defense should take the form of a convention and must be ratified by the parliaments of various countries. However, according to the most reliable authorities here, the participants in the Havana Conference are not prepared to take this progressive and active action. Well-informed sources also pointed out that the development of this defense issue into an action in the form of a convention cannot be realized because the naval and military experts of various countries are not present.

<h3>Prime Minister Konoe's Broadcast Address on Policy Guidelines</h3>
<p>Hong Kong – Tokyo report, Prime Minister Konoe delivered a broadcast address last night, stating that the army and navy and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have reached a complete consensus and are determined to devote themselves to the realization of the "New Political System." There are two evils of political parties: one is that the purpose of establishing the party is to adopt liberalism, democracy, or socialism, and its fundamental worldview and outlook on life are incompatible with the national polity; the second is that the purpose of political parties is mainly to compete for political power, and it is not the way to legislate to assist in major policies. These two evils must be eliminated. The cabinet's policies are as follows: (1) In terms of diplomacy, it is necessary to adopt an independent diplomacy based on Japan's independent position, but it should not only adopt a passive attitude, purely to cope with changes in the world situation, but should occupy a leading position and actively build world order. Therefore, foreign policy should not only be unaffected by the world situation, but also have a long-term vision of ten, twenty, or even fifty years later, and should always move forward autonomously, actively, and constructively; (2) In terms of economy, in order to strongly realize the above-mentioned diplomatic national policy, it is necessary to quickly get rid of the weakness of dependence on foreign countries. The economic cooperation between China, Japan, and Manchuria, and the development of the South Seas are extremely important. In the future, there may be cases where there is a shortage of materials and supplies are not smooth. The government will do its best to ensure the necessities of the people's lives. All citizens should abandon selfishness, increase production and save resources. Government budgets should also be reduced as much as possible and redundant expenses should be saved. However, it is necessary to implement various controls on the private sector, and it is hoped that the people will unanimously obey; (3) In order to adapt to the situation and overcome major difficulties, national education will also be refreshed, etc. (24th dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong – Tokyo report, the Emperor summoned the new Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Tadatsugu Ishiguro, to the palace this afternoon to hold an imperial appointment ceremony. At the same time, Konoe resigned from his concurrent position as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry. It is reported that Ishiguro flew back to Tokyo from the puppet Manchuria on the 22nd.

<h3>Reports of Soviet Ultimatum to Finland Demanding Disarmament Denied by Finnish Officials; Finnish Troops Withdraw from Åland Islands</h3>
<p>Stockholm – According to reliable private sources received here last night, Finland has received an ultimatum from the Soviet Union demanding the complete disarmament of Finnish forces. It is said that the ultimatum was delivered to Finland several days ago, and the demobilization of the Finnish army is already underway. It is widely believed that several generals from the Finnish General Staff, including Chief of Security Franke Kuhl, have arrived here because Finland accepted the ultimatum. (Reuter, 24th)</p>
<p>Helsinki – The Finnish government issued a communiqué yesterday stating that the garrison on the Åland Islands is currently withdrawing. The first troop transport ships have already left the islands. It is said that the Soviet Union had requested Finland to withdraw its garrison from the Åland Islands. Following a League of Nations arbitration in 1921, the islands were ordered to be demilitarized. In 1930, an agreement signed by Finland and Sweden partially abolished the demilitarization regulations. (Haitong News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>Helsinki – Foreign newspapers reported that the Soviet Union had delivered an ultimatum to the Finnish government, making various demands (such as the demobilization of Finnish troops). However, official documents here deny this, stating that the Finnish government is unaware of any ultimatum from the Soviet Union. (Haitong News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>Stockholm – American residents in the Nordic countries, except for diplomatic and consular personnel, will be evacuated immediately and return to the United States. According to well-informed sources, an American ship will sail to the Nordic region, approximately docking at the Finnish port of Petsamo, to transport American expatriates back home. The belligerent nations have guaranteed the safety of this refugee ship. (Haitong News Agency, 24th)</p>

<h3>Germany Invites Romanian and Bulgarian Authorities to a Meeting in Salzburg; Before Launching a Major Offensive Against the British Isles, the Axis Powers Seek to Resolve Outstanding Issues Among the Balkan Countries</h3>
<p>Berlin – The German government announced last night that senior officials from the Romanian and Bulgarian governments, at the invitation of the German government, will arrive in Germany at the end of this week for a "short visit." Informed sources believe that the meeting will take place in Salzburg. The Romanian officials invited to the meeting include Prime Minister Gigurtu and Foreign Minister Manoilescu. The Bulgarian officials invited include Prime Minister Filov and Foreign Minister Popov. Some neutral observers here believe that the holding of this Salzburg meeting indicates that Führer Hitler is not yet prepared to begin his blitzkrieg against England. Germany and the Soviet Union have apparently not reached a compromise on the future status of the Balkans, and the various outstanding issues among the Balkan countries have not been resolved. Some quarters here believe that Hitler will not launch a major offensive against Britain until he secures the Balkans. (Reuter, 24th)</p>
<p>Rome – Romanian Prime Minister Gigurtu and Foreign Minister Manoilescu plan to depart for Salzburg tonight. The Swedish Minister to Romania, Fabrizius, and three officials from the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including the Director of Foreign Intelligence of the Romanian Propaganda Ministry, will accompany the Romanian Prime Minister. (Haitong News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>Sofia – Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov and Foreign Minister Popov may depart tomorrow afternoon. Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Shishmanov, and the legal expert of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Bornakov, and Secretary-General of the Ministry of Interior, Gantchev, will accompany them. (Haitong News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>Sofia – Concerning the report from German radio in Taiwan that the Bulgarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister will visit Germany at the invitation of the German government at the end of this week, people here are paying close attention. Political figures believe that Bulgaria's demands for territorial revision will certainly be one of the issues discussed in the upcoming talks. Especially considering that before the Bulgarian Foreign Minister and Prime Minister arrive in Germany, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop has already decided to meet with Romanian representatives in Salzburg, it seems undoubtedly that Germany will assist Bulgaria in presenting its territorial revision demands to Romania. (Haitong News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>Capital of a Southern Country – The fact that authorities from Romania and Bulgaria are going to Germany at the invitation of the German government to hold a meeting with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop has attracted considerable attention from political figures here. It is generally believed that Germany will facilitate a peaceful resolution of the Romanian-Bulgarian border issue regarding Dobruja. Subsequently, the same type of intervention will be applied to the Romanian-Hungarian border issue. (Haitong News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>Bucharest – Although Romanian Prime Minister Gigurtu and Foreign Minister Manoilescu, who are invited to Salzburg on Friday, are expected to have dinner and talks with Hitler, they will depart for Bucharest that evening. It is generally speculated that their talks will discuss Hungary's demands for border revisions. Well-informed sources are watching the outcome of the discussions with great anxiety, and it is believed that the issue of Outer Transylvania will definitely be raised. The nature of the Hungarian newspapers and radio broadcasts has angered Romania. The Bucharest newspaper Basarabia even published an article on Sunday criticizing the Romanian government's policies, which has greatly surprised the Romanian side. A certain radio station in Budapest stated that the Hungarian minority in Outer Transylvania is being mistreated, and said, "Romania's fate is now sealed." Political figures here are still confused about the division of interests between the Soviet Union and Germany in the Balkan Peninsula. It is generally believed that Germany has temporarily placed Romania under the Soviet sphere of influence. However, news directly from Berlin states that Hitler now wants to clarify the situation in the southeast before starting the attack on Britain. It appears that there will be little territorial cession, and there will be strong resistance. (Reuter, 24th)</p>
<p>Bucharest – Since the news of Germany inviting senior Romanian officials to Salzburg for an important meeting regarding the future of the Balkans was released, Germany and the Soviet Union seemed to intensify their efforts last night, both trying to "save" Romania. According to reliable reports, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is seeking an understanding with the Romanian leaders regarding German and Soviet interests in Romania in the Balkans. At the same time, well-informed sources claim that former Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu will leave here within days for Moscow to fulfill some important mission. Diplomatic circles here believe that the Soviet Union intends to make further demands on Romania, and it is unknown whether these demands can align with Berlin's plans in the Balkans. Recently, well-informed sources claimed that Romania believes that if Germany and the Soviet Union are determined to cooperate in the Balkans, then Romania will be at the mercy of these two countries. However, there was no indication here last night that the Soviet Union and Germany had consulted with each other regarding the German-Romanian meeting in Salzburg. Romanian officials expressed confidence last night, saying that the result of the Salzburg meeting is that Germany will not demand Romania to sacrifice more land. The explanation of the Romanian Prime Minister's visit to Salzburg by informed sources here is that Germany only wants to gain an understanding regarding the future status of the Romanian government. Some quarters believe that the Salzburg meeting is a means to prevent the Soviet Union from further advancing in the southeast. (Reuter, 21st)</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Denies Reports of Forcing Romania to Reorganize Government; News Is Completely Groundless</h3>
<p>Moscow – Recently, foreign newspapers have spread the following rumors about Soviet foreign policy: (1) The Soviet Union allows airplanes to "supply Britain," and Britain has spent 200 million pounds on this matter. (2) In the next few days, the Soviet Union will begin negotiations with Turkey to sign a trade agreement, stipulating that the total trade volume between the two countries will be increased to 12 million Turkish lira. (3) The Soviet Union has delivered an ultimatum to the Romanian government, demanding the establishment of a democratic government, stating that without such a democratic government, it is impossible to establish friendly relations between the two countries.

In addition, Foreign Secretary Halifax recently sent a letter to President Beneš, officially notifying him of this intention. Political figures here have commented on this matter, saying that the government's action is to recognize this provisional government as an administrative agency for the Czech people to assist our country in resisting German aggression. In the future, the people of the two countries will work together to defeat the common enemy. As for the legal status enjoyed by the Czech Provisional Government, it is the same as that of other allied governments organized in our country. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Norwegian Parliament Under German Control; Norwegian Government in Britain States It Can Never Represent Public Opinion</h3>
<p>London – Regarding the plan of the Norwegian Parliament, recently meeting in Norway, to make the Norwegian King abdicate, abolish the Norwegian government, and establish a "National Council" under German control in Norway, the Norwegian government in Britain recently sent a letter signed by Prime Minister Nygaardsvold to the Presidium of the Norwegian Parliament, stating that the Norwegian government's views are completely consistent with the views expressed by King Haakon in his letter to the Presidium on July 3. That is, when the parliament meets in Norway, which is occupied by foreign troops, it cannot truly represent the wishes of the Norwegian people. The idea of establishing a government colluding with Germany, and achieving peace, is a fantasy. (Reuter, 24th)</p>

<p>London – A rumor is currently circulating in various neutral countries, spread by what is ostensibly a fair source from Germany, that Lloyd George and the Duke of Windsor are currently jointly engaged in a peace movement. This rumor is completely unfounded and can be definitively denied. However, given the very clear expressions in the recent speeches of the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary, it is considered unnecessary to continue to issue formal denials regarding the peace movement.

Hitler attended the performance of a famous opera in the theater, which was crowded with his soldiers and workers. Wounded soldiers, makeshift soldiers, armory workers, and frontline workers who traveled from various places to Bayreuth at Hitler's invitation all cheered enthusiastically for Hitler. At the entrance of the theater, Wagner and German leader Dr. Ley welcomed Hitler. After the end of the play, Hitler left Bayreuth. (Haitong News Agency, 24th)</p>
<h3>Britain Levies High Income Tax to Cover War Expenses; Third Budget Approved by House of Commons; Average Daily Military Expenditure Exceeds Eight Million Pounds</h3>
<p>Stockholm – After a fierce debate on the Third War Budget, the British House of Commons passed the budget proposed by Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir Kingsley Wood last night. (Haitong News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>London – Chancellor of the Exchequer Wood presented the budget in the House of Commons last night, announcing that Britain's war expenses have greatly increased, from 40 million pounds per week in April to the current 57 million pounds per week. In order to cope with this huge war expenditure, tax rates cannot be further increased, so: (1) The standard rate of income tax is increased to 8 shillings and 6 pence per pound. (2) Income tax surcharges are increased according to income level. (3) Property tax is increased by 10%. (4) Beer tax is increased by 1 penny per pint. (5) Tobacco tax is increased by 2 shillings per pound. (6) Light wine tax is increased from 5 shillings and 11 pence per gallon to 8 shillings, and strong wine tax is increased from 12 shillings to 16 shillings. (7) Entertainment tax is also appropriately increased. The Chancellor said that the previously proposed purchase tax plan will now be withdrawn, but many items will be taxed appropriately at the time of purchase. All food and beverages are exempt from purchase tax, and fuel, gas, electricity, water, and children's clothing and shoes are also exempt from tax. Machinery and equipment needed by farmers, as well as certain medicines and supplies, are also exempt from tax. According to this new chapter, the purchase of luxury goods and non-essential items, such as furs, silk goods, lace, porcelain, ceramics, cosmetics, etc., will be subject to high taxes, one-third of the wholesale price and 24% of the retail price. The purchase of other items, such as clothing, household appliances, books, and newspapers, will be taxed at a lower rate, one-sixth of the wholesale price and 12% of the retail price. The purchase tax will reduce the revenue of the Ministry of Finance compared to the original proposal, but it can still generate about 110 million pounds per year. Now that the standard rate of income tax has been increased to 8 shillings and 6 pence, the Chancellor intends to modify the tax rate for the first 160 pounds of income of taxpayers. Currently, this tax is half of the standard rate. According to the standard rate of 8 shillings and 6 pence, it should be increased to 4 shillings and 3 pence per pound, but he proposed to increase this tax to 5 shillings per pound. A married man with two children earning 400 pounds previously paid 11 pounds, 17 shillings, and 6 pence in tax, and will now pay 15 pounds, 15 shillings, and 8 pence. Those with an income of 1,000 pounds per year will now have to pay 210 pounds and 10 shillings, instead of 180 pounds, 6 shillings, and 3 pence. According to statistics, the increase in income tax can generate 84 million pounds per year, and 60 million pounds can be obtained this year. The Chancellor then announced the increase in income tax surcharges, saying that for those with an income exceeding 2,000 pounds, the surcharge will increase from 1 shilling and 3 pence per pound to 2 shillings. Higher incomes will be taxed more heavily. Those with an income exceeding 20,000 pounds will be levied a surcharge of 9 shillings and 6 pence per pound. All those with an annual income exceeding 20,000 pounds will have 9/10 of the excess income taken by the state. It is estimated that this increase can generate 11 million pounds per year, and 8 million pounds can be obtained this year. It is estimated that after the increase in income tax and surcharges, a total of 639,000,000 pounds can be obtained throughout the year, compared to 290,000,000 pounds five years ago. Income tax has always been paid in two installments, once every six months. Now, however, all wage earners, from laborers to company managers, will have the tax deducted monthly or weekly from their salaries. The Chancellor then stated that the property tax will be increased by 1/10 again, which can generate 6 million pounds per year, and 1 million pounds can be obtained this year. The beer tax will be increased by 1 penny per pint, which can generate an additional 13 million pounds per year, and 7.5 million pounds can be obtained this year. The tobacco tax will be increased by 2 shillings per pound, which can generate an additional 9 million pounds per year, and 6 million pounds can be obtained this year. The wine tax will be increased from tomorrow, with light wine increasing by 2 shillings and 1 penny per gallon to 8 shillings, and strong wine increasing by 4 shillings to 16 shillings, so that tax revenue can also be increased. As for wines from autonomous regions and colonies, they will still be given preferential treatment. Entertainment tax will also have to be increased, which is estimated to generate an additional 4 million pounds per year. All of these direct and indirect tax increases can generate an additional 86 million pounds this year, and 129 million pounds can be obtained throughout the year. He believed that the repeated taxation of individual expenses must be a necessary part of the current financial proposal. The current budget stipulates an additional tax of 239 million pounds throughout the year, plus the budget of 128 million pounds that increased taxes in April, so the total tax increase in the past three months is 367 million pounds, excluding the 40 million pounds for excess profits tax.</p>
<p>The Chancellor also said that over 300 million pounds of 3% war bonds have been raised, and 250 million pounds of savings certificates and defense bonds have also been sold, and 110 million pounds of 1.5% new war bonds have also been subscribed. All of these achievements have made him confident that the work of making up for the revenue shortfall is not insurmountable. The current financial problems are indeed numerous and difficult, but they are by no means insurmountable. We have abundant resources, and our determination and ability to actively use these resources are beyond doubt. The importance of national finance is no different from the battlefield. We must continue to advance here, sparing no sacrifice until victory is achieved. The Chancellor also stated that the budget of 200 million pounds for war expenses this year, which was set in April, was previously explained as only a speculative figure under the current situation. The reason for estimating 200 million pounds was based on an average weekly war expenditure of 40 million pounds. Recently, the weekly expenditure has increased to 57 million pounds, so the revised estimate of war expenses this year is 180 million pounds, and the revised estimate of the excess of expenditures over income will be close to 220 million pounds. The difference is indeed terrifying, but not enough to make people panic. In order to cope with overseas payments, we can use foreign resources in three main ways: (1) Selling government-owned gold overseas. (2) Selling foreign bonds that the government purchased from the people at home. (3) Autonomous regions and India do not use all of the payments for British goods, but leave a part in Britain as short-term investments. The government intends to limit the ordinary supply to retailers, which can enable manufacturers to maintain and, where possible, expand export trade. We must recognize that export trade is an extremely important part of the war effort. The collection of direct and indirect taxes at the highest possible tax rates is obviously necessary, but it cannot be achieved overnight and must be done gradually. Therefore, this budget can only be regarded as a temporary budget. Smith, speaking on behalf of the Labor Party, said that the increased expenses are evidence of the government's increased efforts and increased production of war equipment. He believed that the Chancellor can levy taxes to the extreme that humans can tolerate. No other country has assumed the responsibilities as heavily as Britain will in the coming months. He expected the people to be willing to bear this responsibility and accept the sacrifices that were not considered a few months ago. Liberal Party Harris also said that the people are prepared to bear this heavy burden, because otherwise they will become slaves. (Reuter, 24th)</p>

The aircraft storage depot in Baden-Baden was bombed and exploded violently, with thick black smoke rising. The Gelsenkirchen oil refinery was attacked. British aircraft dropped bombs, and a huge explosion occurred two minutes later. However, the bombing results were not clearly visible because the line of sight was obstructed by floating clouds. According to reports from other British aircraft, the buildings there were burning fiercely, and thick smoke was soaring, proving that the attack was successful. At the same time, other British aircraft attacked the Essen oil refinery and the Krupp armaments factory, as well as airfields in northern France and Germany, the Amsterdam dockyard and gas depots, and ships in the port of Dunkirk. Only two British aircraft did not return. Yesterday afternoon, British Air Force fighter jets shot down a German bomber off the northeast coast of Scotland. (Reuter, 23rd)</p>

Now that the rainy season is approaching in Abyssinia, it is not without danger to the righteous people, and their military actions will be restricted.

They are scheduled to visit President Chiang within a few days to report. He recently told a reporter from the Central News Agency that they traveled through seven provinces, covering more than 7,500 kilometers, for a period of two months and one week. In addition to inspecting the provinces, they also inspected 61 county governments and central and local agencies in the same locations. The impressions gained were very good. The most interesting and gratifying to the people of the country were about three aspects: First, the living standards of the people across the country have improved consistently, and the rural areas are particularly becoming more prosperous. This is due to the general increase in productivity in recent years, which shows the deep economic potential of the Chinese nation. Second, the provinces all feel a lack of talent in areas such as education, forestry, water conservancy, and hygiene. The provinces are making great efforts to develop institutions and add civil servants. In terms of quantity, the provinces have already achieved considerable results, but in terms of quality, there is still much room for improvement. Third, most provincial governments are able to govern diligently, and civil servants in general are able to work hard without complaining about the hardships of life. The atmosphere in the political circles of the country has indeed undergone a positive transformation. (Telegram, 23rd)</p>

<p>Curbing Terrorist Atrocities: Consular Body Meeting Today; Significance Lies in the Universal Attention from Chinese and Foreign Parties; It is Rumored that the Bureau Has Proposed Measures</p>
<p>K.J. McEuen, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, recently, due to the repeated occurrence of terrorist atrocities in the settlement, especially after the bombing of the Shen Bao newspaper and the assassination of Zhang Sixu, Director of the Great American Printing Company, the Chinese and foreigners were shocked and deeply concerned about the future of security in the Shanghai International Settlement. Therefore, on the 19th of this month (last Saturday), he wrote to Hill, the Danish Consul-General and Dean of the Consular Corps, urging him to convene a consular meeting to discuss ways to maintain security. This was accepted by Hill, the Dean of the Consular Corps, who separately notified the consuls of various countries. The meeting was originally scheduled to be held on Monday of this week (the 22nd of this month), but was postponed to today (the 25th) at 3:30 pm because the Japanese Consul-General Miura cited a lack of time. The nature of the meeting is of great significance and is watched by all parties, Chinese and foreign. A reporter from the Pooming News Agency inquired about this matter with foreign parties yesterday. It is learned that today's Consular Corps meeting will be held in the Board of Directors meeting room of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the Shanghai Municipal Council has begun preparations yesterday. It is rumored that the authorities of the International Settlement seem to have submitted various measures to the Consular Corps to maintain security, requesting cooperation and support. According to well-informed sources, it is believed that after today's Consular Corps meeting, the Shanghai Municipal Council will immediately implement effective measures to prevent terrorist atrocities.</p>
<p>America Watching the Situation in Shanghai</p>
<p>Washington, 24th (United Press) - U.S. government officials stated that the United States is closely monitoring the situation in Shanghai, and said that for any actions taken by Nanjing against the American people, the United States will demand responsibility from Japan. Acting Secretary of State Welles claimed that he knew that several American news correspondents stationed in Shanghai had telegraphed President Roosevelt to report on incidents of personal attacks and threats of violence against them. He was not aware that the White House had received the telegram. Welles declined to comment on the Shanghai telegrams, believing that the government would not issue any statement until President Roosevelt agreed to criticize. However, officials stated that the U.S. government is closely monitoring the situation in Shanghai, and they indicated that a protest has been lodged with the Japanese authorities regarding the case of Mr. Aborn, the Shanghai correspondent of the New York Times. It is recalled that Mr. Aborn reported to the American Consul in Shanghai, Mr. Bottorff, that his residence was broken into by two armed Japanese, who forced him to hand over the draft of a biography of a certain celebrity that he had been writing for nine months. Officials did not specifically criticize this, but their impression last night was that the United States might demand responsibility from Japan for this incident, as in the past incidents encountered by American citizens in "Manchukuo."</p>
<p>Japanese Spokesman Tries to Explain</p>
<p>The Japanese Embassy spokesman, Ken, stated at a reception for reporters last night, regarding the telegram sent by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai to Washington on Tuesday (23rd), that the idea that there is an anti-American sentiment in this city seems to be unfounded. It seems to be entirely a coincidence that so many incidents have occurred between Americans and Japanese in this area in a short period of time. The spokesman argued that the incidents that have occurred should be judged separately on their own merits. Journalists must maintain a calm attitude.</p>
<p>Aborn Incident Still Under Investigation</p>
<p>The Japanese Embassy spokesman also announced at a reception for reporters last night that regarding the incident in which American journalist Aborn was assaulted by Japanese thugs in the Broadway Mansions last Sunday, the reports made by various parties give the impression that the Japanese authorities were the instigators of this case. The spokesman insisted that this case must be treated as an ordinary criminal assault case, as if a Japanese reporter were assaulted in New York under the same circumstances. The spokesman continued that the Japanese authorities have not yet been able to issue a statement regarding the investigation of this case.</p>
<h3>旅華英僑　從戎辦法　巳由英當局規定　入正規軍與步兵</h3>

<p>The English-language Ta Mei Evening Post reports that the British authorities have issued measures for British overseas Chinese to enlist in the British army, which are divided into two plans. The first plan is applicable to men aged 21 to 38. This group of British overseas Chinese can join the British regular army and first serve in British Malaya, but there is no guarantee that their service will be limited to British Malaya. The second plan is applicable to men aged 19 to 30, who can join the Indian Army. Single British overseas Chinese aged 19 to 30 can be assigned to the infantry, while those between 25 and 50, whether married or not, can be assigned to the engineering corps.</p>

<p>Navigation to Various Blockaded Ports in Fujian and Zhejiang is Extremely Difficult; Although Zhenhai Has Been Recaptured, Resumption of Navigation Still Awaits; Ships to Wenzhou and Ou Encounter Obstacles</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Ningbo route has been interrupted since the Japanese navy announced the blockade of the Zhejiang coastal ports on the 16th of this month. On that day, the four ships scheduled to travel from Shanghai to Ningbo, including the Ruita, Changde, Avima Lee, and Jiangsu (which was opening to Ningbo for the first time), all temporarily suspended their voyages to Ningbo. Passenger tickets sold by each ship have also been refunded one after another, and the goods loaded are also undergoing customs clearance and unloading procedures. The goods loaded by the Ruita, a vessel of the Wah Lun Shipping Company, began to be unloaded yesterday. According to news from the shipping industry, although Zhenhai has been completely recovered, the resumption of navigation between Shanghai and Ningbo may still have to wait.</p>
<p>Polly and Falcon Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>The Polly of the Italian Yihua Shipping Company and the Falcon of the Lulin Shipping Company, which operate the Shanghai-Wenzhou route, left Wenzhou for Shanghai on the morning of the 22nd after the Japanese side announced the blockade of the coast. When sailing to the Yanpan waters outside the mouth of the Oujiang River, they were suddenly detained by a Japanese warship, which sent a boat to board the ship for inspection. They were also "warned" by the Italian shipowner that "no ships are allowed to sail in the military action area" along the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian. They were only released at about 5:00 pm. On the way, they encountered a hurricane and only returned to Shanghai at 2:30 pm yesterday. The Falcon also arrived at the same time. The two ships were loaded with a small number of goods and a batch of mail. They will now be temporarily docked in Shanghai, pending the outcome of negotiations before deciding on their next course of action.</p>
<p>New Great and Haiyi Detained and Not Released</p>
<p>The Portuguese New Great, which operates the Shanghai-Ou route, and the German Haiyi, which operates the Shanghai-Lihang route, have not been released since being monitored by Japanese warships and are still blocked off the mouth of the Oujiang River and the waters of Lihang. The ships have now requested the company to ask the consulate to negotiate with the Japanese side to maintain navigation rights.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Zhejiang Mail Awaits Opportunity for Ship Transport</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that since the recapture of Zhenhai, wireless telegraphs between Shanghai and Zhenhai have been restored yesterday, and the local American news agency is receiving and sending messages as usual. However, due to the fact that the area has been occupied and residents have been evacuated, there are bound to be difficulties in delivery, but this is expected to be resolved. Telegrams between Shanghai and Ningbo are still very smooth, and due to the war, traffic is particularly frequent, several times more than usual. As for postal deliveries between Shanghai and eastern Zhejiang, the Shanghai Post Office originally changed the route via Fuzhou and Wuxing to forward the mail. According to the Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry with the transportation section of the Shanghai Post Office, now that Zhenhai has been recaptured and the war in eastern Zhejiang is about to end, foreign shipping companies are planning to resume navigation at the earliest opportunity. Mail sent from Shanghai to eastern Zhejiang will be restored to ship transport in order to facilitate convenience.</p>
<h3>自來火公司工潮　調解仍無頭緒　眾信今日或將開始談判　職員援助工人亦吿怠工</h3>
<p>Gas Company Labor Dispute: Mediation Still Has No Clue; It is Believed that Negotiations May Begin Today; Staff Also Goes on Strike to Assist Workers</p>
<p>After the workers of the old plant of the British-owned Gas Company submitted a written request for 16 items to Chief Engineer Samson on the 19th, the company refused, resulting in a go-slow strike. The workers of the old plant also requested all staff and workers of the Yangshupu new plant to respond to the workers of the old plant, so they went on strike from the 20th, and all staff also went on a sit-down strike from that day.</p>
<p>Staff Strikes to Show Support</p>
<p>However, the staff did not make any demands to the manager, Blanc. This strike is purely to assist the workers and express sympathy. At 10:00 am yesterday, the chairman of the company, Jia Daoli, suddenly ordered all Chinese staff to leave the office from 11:00 am. After all staff explained the difficulties of this strike, the company authorities then understood, so all Chinese staff still sat in the office, waiting for the workers' side to resolve the matter.</p>
<p>Workers Plan to Appeal to All Parties</p>
<p>According to worker representatives, the unfortunate incident occurred because the company authorities failed to fulfill the conditions for improving treatment agreed upon in April. At a time when prices are soaring and the cost of living is high, it is really difficult to maintain, so they had no choice but to make demands to the company authorities again. However, they did not obtain the understanding of Chief Engineer Samson, the person in charge of the company, who refused to reply and could not negotiate, forming the current stalemate. Now the workers' side plans to appeal to all relevant groups for assistance.</p>
<p>Gas Supply Unsatisfactory</p>
<p>Since the labor dispute occurred, although Gu Bingyuan, director of the Industrial Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council, has been mediating, the attitudes of both sides are firm and there is no way to start. The company has hired a large number of White Russians to replace the work, so the gas supply has not been interrupted. However, due to the lack of experience of the newly hired White Russians, the new work is not satisfactory. According to a staff member of the company, the gas pressure is often reduced at noon every day, resulting in a reduction in the heat of various users, but the raw materials used by the company are more than usual, which has caused considerable losses.</p>
<p>Rumors that Negotiations May Begin Today</p>
<p>The English-language Ta Mei Evening Post reports that the British-owned Gas Company, due to the workers' strike, cannot continue to supply gas as usual, and announced this morning (24th) that from noon today, the gas supply in the northern part of the Public Concession will be halved compared to usual. Personnel of the company could not say for sure whether gas users in the southern part of the Public Concession would also be affected. However, the company is expected to take temporary measures to maintain normal supply as much as possible during the strike period. Labor and management have not yet held discussions, but it is believed that negotiations may begin tomorrow (25th). At the same time, the company has hired several White Russians to enter the factory to continue the work, and several Western employees are also working extra hours in the factory.</p>

<p>10,000 Tons of Foreign Rice Will Arrive by the End of the Month; Future Sales in the Market Must Comply with Evaluation</p>
<p>The Rice Dealers Group ordered 100,000 bags of foreign rice (10,000 tons) for continuous shipment to Shanghai for adjustment. Subsequently, after the establishment of the Rice Evaluation Committee, a subcommittee was established to handle the ordering of foreign rice by the group. Each foreign firm was entrusted to order rice from abroad by telegram, totaling 75,000 bags from Saigon and 25,000 bags from Hong Kong, and the quality was quite good. Of these foreign rice, more than 20,000 bags from Hong Kong have been continuously shipped to Shanghai for the market. All 75,000 bags from Saigon were loaded onto ships from the place of origin at the beginning of this month and can be successively shipped to Shanghai around the 27th and 28th of this month. It is learned that if the importers of this batch of foreign rice supply the market in the future, the transaction price must be sold below the price assessed by the Rice Evaluation Committee.</p>

<p>Hurricane Turns, Hits Nagasaki; Wind Force Expands Around; Huangpu River High Tide Next Month</p>
<p>According to the report obtained by the Xujiahui Observatory at 4:00 pm yesterday, the typhoon that passed outside Wusongkou had already blown to a location at 40 degrees north latitude and 134 degrees east longitude. The wind direction has also changed from "due north" to "northeast", and the wind force has decreased from eight to six. However, the range of the center of the wind force has expanded from a circumference of 60 nautical miles to a circumference of 120 nautical miles. According to the above azimuth, the hurricane has blown from the East China Sea to the Sea of Japan, and Nagasaki, Japan, will be attacked by the passage of the hurricane. The high tide of the Huangpu River has subsided since yesterday. It is found that next month, because it is the middle of the autumn flood season, the tide of the Huangpu River will reach nearly 13 feet at its highest, which will be adjacent to the Jiang'an River bank. If there is wind and rain, it is prone to flooding.</p>
<h3>物價調查處　籲請市民合作　奸商抬價應吿發並證明　當局方可判斷加以處置</h3>
<p>Price Investigation Office Calls for Citizens to Cooperate; Price Gouging by Unscrupulous Merchants Should be Reported and Proven; Only then Can the Authorities Judge and Deal With It</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reports that an official from the Price Investigation Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council recently called on citizens to cooperate with the office and report any illegal profiteering by merchants in order to curb the high cost of living. It is claimed that the Shanghai Municipal Council is eager to raise public concern about the prices of food and commodities. Citizens can certainly denounce illegal profiteers as despicable and unscrupulous merchants, but the Shanghai Municipal Council cannot make a judgment without proof. Therefore, it is eager for public cooperation. Whenever a merchant charges excessively high prices, they should report it to the authorities and provide proof. Only then can the authorities take action.</p>
<p>Urge Reporting</p>
<p>Most citizens do not pay attention to the work of the office. Take household bread as an example. It sells for 38 cents per pound, while other kinds of bread sell for 60 to 70 cents. The Shanghai Municipal Council has widely publicized this, but many citizens say they have not heard of household bread, which is quite surprising. The staff of the Price Investigation Office do their best to work for the citizens, and if they receive reports, they will do their best to handle them. Now some merchants are still raising prices indiscriminately and profiting illegally. The Price Investigation Office cannot do anything about this without proof.</p>
<p>Household Bread</p>
<p>Household bread baked by bakeries in the Public Concession can still be profitable. Recently, the price of Chinese flour has risen by 80 cents per bag. The bakeries have asked the Shanghai Municipal Council to reconsider the price limit. The bureau suggested that the matter be put on hold until the beginning of next month for discussion. The bakeries have agreed, hoping that the price of flour will fall at that time so that there is no need to raise the price of bread. At the same time, it is necessary to ensure that the public can buy the household bread they need.</p>
<p>In addition, the Fair Price Committee of the French Concession, in view of the fact that the public's complaints about the manufacture of household bread are not sufficient, inspected several bakeries in the concession on June 27, with representatives from the Police Department and the Health Department. It was found that the household bread sold by each shop was of good quality and sufficient quantity, and those bakeries that did not comply with the regulations were also punished.</p>

<h3>華北日偽　壟斷紗布　天津已實行　價格受統制</h3>
<p>Japanese Puppet Regime in North China Monopolizes Yarn; Implemented in Tianjin; Prices Subject to Control</p>
<p>The Japanese puppet regime in North China is oppressing merchants and civilians at every level. In addition to yarn, the import and export of all goods is completely under control, implementing "goods exchange." If goods are transported from other ports, they cannot be exchanged for cash and must be purchased entirely with local goods. Export goods must be settled in foreign exchange and must be stored in Yokohama Bank as a deposit. This method has been implemented for almost a year, and merchants have suffered greatly from this scourge. Recently, it has become even more intensified. Yarn is also being planned to be under control. The price must also be estimated by the local Japanese puppet regime, and cannot be increased or decreased privately. Tianjin was originally scheduled to implement it from the 1st of this month, but it was postponed to the 5th. It is heard that the local Japanese yarn factories have negotiated with the Tianjin Japanese Military Department, so the yarn from the factory can be transported without restrictions. Recently, it has also been heard that Yantai, Weihaiwei, and other ports will also implement control at the end of this month. Therefore, in the future, shipments of piece goods and cotton yarn from this city to various ports in North China, regardless of the products of British, American, or other merchants, will be squeezed out without any doubt.</p>

<h3>本埠英僑志願捐款　購機捐獻政府　已得英金一三四五一鎊　及華幣二零七五三六元</h3>
<p>British Overseas Chinese in This City Voluntarily Donate Funds to Purchase Aircraft and Donate Them to the Government; Already Received £13,451 Sterling and $207,536 Chinese Currency</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European War, British overseas Chinese in this city have shown great patriotism and have donated large sums of money to help the government in the war of resistance or to provide for the needs of caring for wounded soldiers. The British Overseas Chinese Wartime Voluntary Donation, which was recently launched, has been well-received since its promotion. According to the association's announcement, as of the 20th of this month, the donations received by HSBC and Mackellar &amp; Co. totaled £13,451, 10 shillings and 2 pence sterling and $207,536 Chinese currency. The result is very satisfactory, but it is still far from the planned amount of £50,000. Currently, British overseas Chinese are working hard to solicit donations in order to reach the huge amount of £50,000, aid the government's war of resistance, and demonstrate the loyalty of the overseas Chinese in this city to the government and people of their motherland.</p>
<p>Fundraising to Purchase Warplanes for Donation to the Government</p>
<p>The British Overseas Chinese Wartime Voluntary Donation is currently planning to purchase a squadron of aircraft and donate them to the government to enhance the strength of the war of resistance. Among them, it is planned to purchase several single-wing fighters and Whirling drome three-engine long-range bombers. These aircraft have repeatedly established meritorious service and inflicted serious blows on the enemy. It is said that the long-range bombers can take off from England, fly to any place in Germany to drop bombs, and return to defense safely.</p>

<h3>Lai Yiren Accused of Bigamy Transferred to Special Court No. 1 Due to Jurisdictional Error</h3>
<p>Lai Yiren, a 41-year-old Guangdong native residing at No. 13, Yunshang Village, Lane 22, Sitolang Road, French Concession, currently employed by the AIG Insurance Company, formerly Assistant Manager of the Nanjing Commercial Savings Branch, and once a university professor, married Huang Qiaolian, a woman of the same hometown and age, in 1929. They had children. Later, disliking her for being old and losing her looks, on August 18th of last year, he again married Fei Guiying, a 25-year-old woman from Pinghu (a graduate of Cambridge English College, former university professor, and currently working for AIG Insurance Company), at the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road. On April 27th of this year, they had a son. Due to postpartum illness, she was admitted to Crome Hospital for treatment on June 16th. When she recovered and was discharged from the hospital this month, she found that Lai had moved out, and discovered that Lai was cohabiting with Niu Jingyuan (age 27, a policewoman from Beiping). She reported this to the police, who summoned Lai to the Special Court. The police prosecuted him for bigamy. According to the plaintiff's statement of the previous situation, and the engagement of a lawyer as an agent, an additional 2,000 yuan was sought in compensation. Lai Yiren claimed that he and Huang Qiaolian were only cohabiting and not married, and that he had been cohabiting with Niu Jingyuan for many years, not committing bigamy. It was ordered to reschedule the hearing to summon witnesses for questioning. Yesterday, another hearing was held. First, the police lawyer, Fei Xizhen, stated that the bigamy in this case occurred in the Public Concession and should be transferred to the Special Court No. 1 for trial. Judge Sun Pengham ordered that the case be transferred to the Special Court No. 1 for investigation, and the defendant remained under the original bail.</p>
<h3>A Bomb Found on Jing'an Temple Road Fortunately Did Not Explode</h3>

The police are currently investigating the source of the bomb.</p>
<h3>A Gangster Shot Dead</h3>

The day before yesterday (the 23rd), Lu gathered a group of accomplices and planned to extort money from a certain gambling den. Unexpectedly, while passing near Shanzhong Lane on Robert Road, two thugs suddenly rushed out of the roadside and fired several shots at Lu Wenkuan with guns. Lu was unable to dodge in time and was hit in the head three times. Due to the seriousness of the injuries, he fell to the ground on the spot, barely breathing. The murderers, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled without a trace. The police arrived at the scene and sent Lu to the hospital, but it was too late to save him, and he died.</p>
<h3>Chinese Police Officer's Gun Robbed Bravely Recovered Thief Seriously Injured and Died</h3>
<p>Around 12:00 PM yesterday, near Jiaozhou Road, Robert Road, Huxi, Chinese Police Officer No. 2482 of the Putuo Road Police Station was on duty when two unarmed thugs suddenly hugged him around the waist and snatched his official pistol. After one of the thugs got the pistol, he ran away quickly. Although the Chinese police officer's pistol was robbed, he still had a wooden baton hanging on his waist. He tracked and followed closely. The thief did not know how to use the gun and was eventually caught by the police officer, who struck the thief's head several times with the baton, causing brain matter to splatter. The thief was injured, fell to the ground, and was captured. The original gun was recovered. The other thief escaped without a trace. The police station was notified and dispatched a large number of detectives to investigate and dispatched an ambulance to take the injured thief, Li Yongkang (28 years old), to the police hospital.

<h3>After Disappearance, Child Bride Suddenly Marries Another Woman Files Lawsuit Claiming Marriage Contract Invalid Factory Owner Accused of Disrupting Family</h3>
<p>Shi Yun, a woman from Ningbo, recently filed a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court with her daughter Zheng Shi Meiying, engaging a lawyer to accuse Li Hanmin, the young owner of the Tiancheng Light Bulb Factory at No. 270, E'erjin Road, Zhejiang, and Zhou Hongying of disrupting the family. The indictment stated that Shi Yun's husband, Shi Dingyou, hired Zhou Hongying, the nine-year-old daughter of Zhou Dunlu, in Dantu County on June 8th of the lunar calendar in 1931 as a child bride for his son Shi Wenlin. They had a betrothal gift. After she came to their home, they lived peacefully. Later, due to difficult living conditions, on July 15th, 1933, Hongying was sent to live with Shi Meiying's family, and Shi was asked to supervise her. However, Meiying also found the family poor and had to ask Hongying to learn to make light bulbs as a female worker. In March 1939, she changed to work at Tiancheng Light Bulb Factory. Unexpectedly, on April 9th, Hongying suddenly disappeared. The next morning, she received a letter from Hongying's lawyer</p>
<p>requesting dissolution of the marriage agreement. On May 22nd, she received a summons from the Second Special Court regarding a lawsuit to confirm the invalidity of the marriage contract. As Shi lived far away in Chongqing, she was unable to respond to the lawsuit. Now, something unexpected happened: on the 6th of this month, Hongying was induced by the defendant Li Hanmin (the young owner of the Tiancheng factory) to marry at the Zhimeilou Restaurant on Fourth Horse Road. It was also rumored that Hongying was already several months pregnant. Hongying is only seventeen years old and should be protected and supervised by Shi in accordance with the law. Moreover, Hongying's lawsuit in the Second Special Court to declare the marriage contract invalid</p>
<p>has not yet been decided. How can she proceed with other matters? Hongying is just young and ignorant and has been deceived, while the defendant Li Hanmin is clearly committing a crime under Article 240, Section 12 of the Criminal Law. It is requested that he be punished according to the law. However, after receiving the summons, the defendant Li Hanmin also engaged a lawyer to file a defense, stating that the defendant's ex-wife had passed away and he had not remarried. In June of this year, Chen Yimin, an employee of the Tiancheng factory, came forward as a matchmaker. He was quite familiar with Zhou Hongying's parents. Now Zhou's daughter is dissatisfied with the marriage contract arranged by her parents and chooses to marry Shi Wenlin. Now that the girl is an adult, she is willing</p>
<p>to form another good marriage and marry the defendant. Therefore, on July 6th, they formally married at Zhimeilou. Because Zhou's father is paralyzed in his hometown, his uncle Fu Kui was entrusted to preside over the wedding. In summary, this case is entirely due to the failure to extort a thousand yuan. It is requested that he be acquitted. Yesterday morning, Judge Meng questioned the case and ordered that it be rescheduled for further verification.</p>
<h3>Bomb Thrown into Gambling Den at No. 1238 Two Gamblers Severely Injured</h3>
<p>At 10:30 PM yesterday, at the large gambling den at No. 1238, Pingyuan Road, Huxi, while the gamblers were loudly calling out their bets and in high spirits, a thug suddenly threw a bomb inside, causing an explosion on the spot. Thick smoke filled the air, and the sound shook the surroundings. Many gamblers, hearing the loud noise, were extremely frightened and fled for their lives in panic, causing great chaos. Afterwards, near a certain gambling table, two male and female gamblers were found to be severely injured by the explosion. They were taken to the hospital for treatment by ambulance. It was also heard that the injured man and woman had died due to their severe injuries.</p>
<h3>Gambling Still Rampant in Nanshi</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources, flower club gambling in various places in Nanshi has become even more rampant in recent days, causing great harm. At the same time, small-scale fake gambling dens in the Jiumudi area have opened one after another since mid-June, including Gaosheng Teahouse at No. 25, Gaodun Street, Jigan Company at No. 16, Jianli Lane, No. 98, Luxiangyuan Road, Xiangsheng Company at No. 11, Ren'an Lane, No. 36 on the same road, Ren'an Fuxing Company at No. 20 on the same lane, Yongli Cold Drink Teahouse at No. 3, Yuqing Lane on the same road, Rongsheng Company at No. 10, Liu Fen Lane, Heng'an Company at No. 16, Heng'an Lane, Fangbang Road, Nanyang Bridge. As of 5:00 PM on the 24th, they were still openly enticing people to gamble. Rumors of closure and arrests were not true. In addition, the Sanweng gambling den on Minguo Road is currently waiting for an opportunity to open. At the same time, No. 1451, Zhonghua Road, outside the Old West Gate, is about to be renovated and named Xiyuan Dance Hall. It is expected to be a disguised gambling den. However, citizens are advised to be cautious and not be tempted. It will inevitably disappear naturally soon.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, According to Lu Zhenqing, the director of the Zhongxi Sanatorium, much of the content of the news article "Head Nurse Dies Suddenly" on page 12 of the Shen Bao on the 20th of this month is inconsistent with the facts. (1) Li Shizhen and others have fabricated false accusations against Zhenqing, such as saying that Li Jieru (i.e., Yu Ying) died suddenly from poisoning. After an autopsy, the forensic doctor determined that she died of acute heart disease and there was no poisoning. (2) On the 19th of this month, the investigative court only summoned Zhenqing to the court to inquire about the disposal of Li Jieru's belongings and did not summon Lin Zhengliang. (3) The deceased's remaining funds of 7,200 yuan were deposited in the sanatorium during her lifetime as a guarantee for the food and medicine expenses of her eight family members during their 21 months of hospitalization. This account has not yet been settled and is pending court order for settlement. (4) The deceased's numerous pieces of clothing and three gold bracelets are pending court order for the lawyers of both parties to discuss a settlement plan. After a public announcement in the newspaper regarding Li Jieru's outstanding debts, if there are no objections, they will be handed over to the plaintiff's attorneys, Zhuang and Li, for safekeeping. Before the case is resolved, Attorneys Zhuang and Li will provide the Li family with a monthly living allowance of 200 yuan, not to exceed that amount, to prevent the remnants from being insufficient to repay the debts. Therefore, the debts will also be handled by Attorneys Zhuang and Li. The above items have been signed in court by all parties involved and their respective attorneys, and there are investigative records to prove it. No other issues were involved. As it concerns my reputation, I specifically ask you to send a letter on my behalf to the Shen Bao to request a correction for your consideration, respectively. I am now informing you for the urgent consideration of the chief editor of the Shen Bao for a quick correction. Yours sincerely, Lawyers Ling Changyan, Shan Yuhua,</p>
<h3>Zhu He, Son of Late Famous Doctor Zhu Nanshan Kidnapped Yesterday Criminals Registered in Advance Requesting House Call Car Arrives at Xiaoshadu Road No Kidnapping</h3>
<p>Zhu Hegao, a 30-year-old native of Nantong, is the second son of the late famous doctor Zhu Nanshan. He runs a clinic at No. 96, Avenue Edward VII, Public Concession. His medical practice is prosperous and his income is very high. In addition to practicing medicine, Zhu also runs a pharmaceutical business. Over the years, his family has become quite wealthy and owns a private car, No. 2007, which aroused the covetousness of criminals. Yesterday afternoon, a well-dressed man went to Zhu's clinic to register and requested a house call, paying the consultation fee in full. He said that the patient lived at No. 3, Lane 337, Xiaoshadu Road. After speaking, he turned around and went outside. At 5:95 PM in the evening, Zhu Hegao and two students took his private car, No. 2007, to the address. Unexpectedly, upon arriving at the lane, they could not find No. 3 anywhere. They turned back to step out of the lane entrance, preparing to board the car and return home, when suddenly four kidnappers emerged from the roadside. Three of the criminals drew pistols, threatening them to stop the car. The driver, seeing the pistols, dared not resist and stayed with the car. One of the criminals chased the driver down, and the four criminals then boarded the car in succession, kidnapping Zhu Hegao and his two students. One of the criminals drove the car at full speed and fled without a trace. The driver immediately reported to the police station in charge.</p>

<h3>New Regulations for Hong Kong School Buildings Execution Delayed for Justice Schools</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong ) Currently, the Hong Kong Education Authority, in order to improve the learning environment for students in various schools, has promulgated new education regulations, requiring all schools to comply with the regulations in a short period. The facilities of the justice schools for the poor in Hong Kong and Kowloon are also subject to the restrictions of these regulations. However, the nature of running justice schools is only to educate and nurture poor children, and everything is simplified and focuses on the general. In terms of funding, it relies solely on the efforts of charitable organizations or individual overseas Chinese merchants. Therefore, in addition to striving for perfection in teaching, the facilities of each justice school cannot take into account other hygiene and various facilities as stipulated in the education regulations. Moreover, the number of students accommodated by each justice school is no less than that of other schools. Therefore, after the implementation of this regulation, tens of thousands of poor students will lose the opportunity to enjoy education. For this reason, the persons in charge of each justice school have repeatedly consulted on remedial measures and have sent letters to four Chinese representatives, requesting them to appeal to the Hong Kong government authorities and urge the repeal of the parts of the new regulations related to justice schools, in order to protect the education of tens of thousands of students. According to the letter, the Chinese representatives forwarded it to the Hong Kong authorities. When this proposal was presented at the Legislative Council meeting in the previous period, the Chinese representative Lo Man Kam raised questions and argued reasonably, believing that very few of the public schools in Hong Kong can meet the requirements of the regulations in their equipment and school building construction methods. There is a need for repeal. According to semi-official sources, the Hong Kong government authorities now consider the reasons for this request to be very sufficient and worth considering. Moreover, the flourishing phenomenon of various justice schools has only been seen since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. Therefore, their nature is a wartime adjunct. If the Sino-Japanese War ends, the number of justice schools will inevitably decrease, which can be predicted. Moreover, in this extraordinary period, it is not easy for each justice school to find a school building that meets the requirements of the new regulations. Therefore, in order to protect the education of each student, it may accept the request of each justice school and postpone the implementation of the regulations.</p>
<h3>Recent Work of the Plant Pathology Group at the Tsinghua University Agricultural Research Institute</h3>
<p>(Kunming Correspondent) The recent work of the Plant Pathology Group at the National Tsinghua University Agricultural Research Institute is briefly described below:</p>
<p>(1) The Yunnan Economic Plant Disease Survey Association surveyed Kunming, Anning, Dongchuan, Zhaotong, and more than 20 other places, collected more than 4,700 wheat spikes, and hundreds of disease specimens. The diseases of various economic plants, such as rice, wheat, millet, sorghum, fruits, and vegetables, were analyzed one by one, and several species were found in each category.</p>
<p>(2) Research on Wheat Diseases The quality of Yunnan wheat varieties is not low, but due to mixed varieties and rampant diseases, the output is greatly affected. The institute conducted various experiments on foreign varieties, improved varieties, and fungicides for the prevention and control of wheat smut to prepare for research.</p>
<p>(3) Prevention and Control of Cotton Diseases Cooperating with the Yunnan Cotton Promotion Committee and sending personnel to conduct field surveys, it is planned to carry out disease-resistant breeding work.</p>
<p>(4) Soybean Seed Selection Experiments Seeds from various provinces were planted separately for the purpose of cultivating soybean varieties suitable for Yunnan Province. It is necessary to have excellent quality and abundant yield, and the most qualified are those that can resist root rot and pod rot.</p>
<p>(5) Discovery of New Species of Bacteria The canker of castor bean and the scabies of soybeans may be new species unseen by predecessors and require special attention. The institute has written a detailed report.</p>
<p>(6) Research on Chicken Fungus Because chicken fungus grows on termite nests, this type of termite must rely on the fungi cultivated on the fungal platform in the nest to survive. Separation and cultivation are carried out to investigate the changes, and a preliminary research report has been written.</p>
<p>(7) Fungal Survey In addition to those that cause diseases on economic plants, there are many types of fungi that are related to human life. The group has collected more than 2,000 fungal specimens in Yunnan, named them, and drawn illustrations, planning to cooperate with Jinling University to compile an atlas of fungi in Sichuan and Yunnan.</p>

<h3>Eastern Team in Yangon Heavily Defeats Champion Team – Hou Scores Three Goals</h3>
<p>(Yangon, June 28th Dispatch) The Eastern Football Club expedition team defeated the Yangon League champion Customs team today in a bitter rainstorm by a score of four to one. The first half ended in a one-to-one tie. There were 15,000 spectators. In this match, Hou Chengtuo, the left winger of the Eastern team, performed excellently and was the most dangerous person among all the forwards. The defenders Wu Qixiang and Li Yichen also had brilliant performances, repeatedly repelling the enemy's attack from thousands of miles away in the first half when the Yangon team launched many offensives. Their contribution was very great. Ji Youling, who joined from Singapore as a right midfielder, was quite steady. Another outstanding performer was the left forward Cao Qiuting. After the start of the game, the Customs team scored first, but Hou Chengtuo equalized before the end of the first half. The Eastern team often took the offensive in the second half, but due to the muddy field, all movements in the game were quite slow and also quite rough. Hou Chengtuo broke through the enemy's defenses twice from the left wing and shot successfully. Xu Wenkui scored a goal with a beautiful shot from the center forward position. In conclusion, the Eastern team overcame the Yangon champion team by a score of four to one. The Eastern lineup is as follows:</p>

<h3>Finance – Little Fluctuation in Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed prices. The dark market for British and American currencies seemed the same as before. This was because there were no stimulating news from home and abroad, and most operators were in a state of rest. Any activity was all swap trading. Looking at the process of the half-day, from the opening in the morning to the closing at noon, there were no fluctuations. However, it was heard that the Bank of Italy was opening August exchange rates at 3 yuan and 7 jiao and 7 fen, and this price showed a slight drop. Therefore, the London gold closing price was slightly increased by 0.015625, to 3 shillings and 890625 pence. The US dollar was 6 yuan and 1 jiao and 2 fen and 5 li, as stable as before. The trend of futures was no different from that of the spot market.</p>
<p>Trading Remains Only Swaps</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London market was higher, with a near-term increase of 25 and a far-term price steady. The New York silver market remained steady, and London raw gold was flat. The exchange rate for British against American currency was unchanged, and against Shanghai was also flat. The American dollar was higher by half a point against the British pound, higher by one point against Shanghai, and there was no market against the French franc. The central bank's listed exchange rates for all currencies remained the same. Banks opened the spot selling prices in the morning, with British gold at 3 shillings and 875 pence and the US dollar at 6 yuan and 125 li, with no changes compared to the previous day's evening closing. At the same time, futures opened very steady. After opening, it was heard that the China Bank Shanghai had bought US dollars for this month from foreign banks at 6 yuan and 15625 li, but this price was quite difficult to settle. HSBC announced its listed prices at 9:30, with no changes at all. The silver balancing tax increased by 1.75%. After this, the market remained stable. It was calculated that an American bank sold US dollars for this month to Chinese merchant speculators at 6 yuan and 125 li. Other banks' swaps for July and August were all at 0625. By noon, the Bank of Italy was opening August exchange rates at 3 yuan and 7 jiao and 7 fen, which seemed to have slightly dropped. Therefore, the closing price of British gold increased slightly by 0.015625, to 3 shillings and 90625 pence. The US dollar was 6 yuan and 1 jiao and 2 fen and 5 li, and August was 6 yuan and 0625 li, with no difference compared to the day before yesterday.

The "Joint Notes" in the dark market were cheaper by 5 jiao, at 95 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Market Peaceful and Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold dark market conditions were even more desolate, which was also a rare occurrence recently. This was because the foreign exchange market lacked fluctuations, and the market was peaceful and quiet. Speculators had no way to start, and there were very few transactions. The market opened in the early morning because the silver house sold only 5,000 at 141 yuan, 30 yuan lower than the previous day. Later, due to short covering by money changers and securities firms willing to buy at low prices, it was pulled up to 5,280 yuan. However, small retail investors took the opportunity to sell, so the noon closing price was lower at 5,263 yuan, 7 yuan smaller compared to the previous night's closing. In the afternoon, there was no market on Wednesday. The half-day transaction was only about 700 to 800 taels. Silver jewelry remained steady, and customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Gold Fell Again by 7 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the first tael (10 taels) in the early morning carried the fatigue from the previous day, there were quite a few sellers when it opened, and it was actually pressed down by 30 yuan. A certain silver house sold 20 taels to fellow firms at 5,240 yuan. Later, the foreign exchange rate was flat, and the gold price could not help but be too small, which soon caused considerable buying. Money changers and silver houses absorbed especially much. Although a certain gold house and scalpers dumped at this time, the number was difficult to measure, and it finally saw an increase of 40 yuan. Silver houses did 50 taels with each other at 5,280 yuan, but after this, there were still many sellers at the higher price, and the upward trend was immediately hindered. And before long, securities firms and retail investors sold out, and the price could not support the downstream. By the time of closing, it had retreated to 5,263 yuan, resulting in 7 yuan smaller than the previous day. There were only 40 yuan up and down in half a day. The cash house's selling price of its own brand of gold was several tens of yuan higher according to the gold, and the purchase price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little activity.</p>
<p>Jewelry Stands Still</p>
<p>The exchange of silver jewelry per tael is still flat. Datong Bank still hangs 540 yuan, and the new colleagues are similar to the above price, and the purchase is reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw small changes in gold, and British and American gold and iron pounds were also stable. The demand for British gold tickets has gradually decreased, and the price has trended downward again. The American gold ticket hovered between 10 yuan, 2 jiao and 5 fen and 3 jiao, and finally settled at 16 yuan, 3 jiao and 7 fen, a reduction of 4 fen compared to the previous day. Hong Kong tickets had slightly more demand, and the market price rose slightly. Japanese gold tickets and Korean tickets still had high demand, and the market prices rose slightly. The former was 1 yuan, 1 jiao, 1 fen and 2 li, and the latter was 1 yuan and 5 li.</p>
<h3>Securities and Foreign Debt Report Declines, Domestic Debt Slightly Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities dark market saw a slight sell-off by floating investors, and there were no enthusiastic buyers. Market prices were slightly weaker. Many parties without real strength often followed the rise and fall of the market, resulting in a slight wave-like phenomenon in the market. There were more transactions yesterday morning, with Lemao Lianyi buying, but Tongkang Hongdashun, Tailianhe, etc. all had sell-offs. Buying sentiment was stronger, and market prices were slightly weaker. Transactions were extremely light in the afternoon, and the ups and downs were extremely small, and it had become stagnant. As a result, market prices all fell by a small amount of 1 jiao to 3 jiao and 5 fen. The total number of transactions was estimated to be about 500,000 yuan. A simple category table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A 62.7 62.70 Down 0.30</p>
<p>Unified B 54.00 53.80 53.80 Down 0.15</p>
<p>Unified C 52.30 51.90 51.90 Down 0.35</p>
<p>Unified D 50.70 50.70 Down 0.10</p>
<p>Unified E 51.40 51.30 51.30 Down 0.20</p>
<p>Stock transactions involved 70 shares of Zhentai Yarn Factory, with a price of 94 yuan.</p>
<p>The stock market in the Public Concession yesterday, like other markets in the city, has turned into a gloomy stage after a relatively optimistic action of one or two weeks. British Union and Jardine Matheson's transactions again accounted for the largest number. A certain Jardine Matheson share direct transaction opened with a large number of 10,000 shares. Rubber shares were quiet and stable.</p>

A total of 4 jiao and 4 fen will be distributed throughout the year.</p>
<h3>Grain – More Large Quantities of Foreign Rice Are Arriving, Rice Prices Still Weak</h3>
<p>After the rice market softened the day before yesterday, the market opened yesterday with sales still unchanged. The original root merchants also held firm, and the market presented a stalemate situation in the early market. The market still lacked changes. However, the general floating speculators, seeing that sales were stagnant again, were discouraged and began to sell out first. Therefore, the foreign rice market fell slightly by about half a yuan. The original root merchants also followed suit, and thus the price dropped by 1 yuan. However, the sales market gradually became active, and the local rice shops took advantage of the cheap prices to purchase, and their intentions were quite strong. The near-market situation gradually became weak and tight, and the selling price also rebounded slightly. As a result, the closing price of No. 1 old Saigon was again far from 56 yuan. It was heard that all the Saigon rice that was previously ordered would arrive in port within a few days. The arriving goods were estimated to be three ships of about 150,000 to 160,000 bags. In addition, there were small batches of 20,000 to 30,000 bags and small batches of 3,000 to 5,000 bags that could arrive from Hong Kong and Vietnam. Therefore, people were weak and wanted to sell out. The opening price in the early market immediately fell by more than 1 yuan. Later, local merchants took advantage of the small inquiries, and there were also customers and short covering activities on the road goods. The market returned to 2 jiao to 3 jiao before the closing. The opening price of road goods was flat, and then the Shantou and Hangzhou gangs made some inquiries, and the short covering also made some inquiries. The cargo side insisted. No. 2 rice loaded on June 26th rose from 62 yuan to 62 yuan and 2 jiao, a better 2 jiao. Saigon No. 2 for early July also rose by 8 jiao to 61 yuan, and broken rice loaded on July 15th opened at 50 yuan. The total market turnover was nearly 300 tons, and the current rice was less than 4,000 bags.</p>
<p>The arrival of japonica and glutinous rice is still sparse, only 600 to 700 bags of japonica rice. It is rumored that general cargo owners in the Ming and dark markets not only have slow sales but also light selling, and although the selling price has depreciated limitedly, it is only about half a yuan. Changbang fresh special Qing japonica is 69 yuan and 68 yuan and a half, special Qing japonica is 68 yuan, Wuxi Qing japonica is 67 yuan and a half, 67 yuan, Changzhou Sukun japonica is high from 66 yuan and a half to 62 yuan, Qingsi thin rice is 66 yuan and 7 yuan, Nangang early rice is 63 yuan, and Hujian is 60 yuan, fresh is 61 yuan, 60 yuan and 5 yuan, glutinous rice Yangzhou special yuan is 63 yuan and 6 jiao, 63 yuan, Jintan special yuan is 63 yuan and 2 jiao, 62 yuan for 8 jiao, Changdan Baiyuan is 62 yuan and a half, 62 yuan, second is 60 yuan and 8 jiao, Hong Kong special goods are 60 yuan and 59 yuan and a half, city is 58 yuan, and second is 57 yuan and 56 yuan and a half.</p>
<h3>Japanese Flour Rebounds</h3>
<p>The decline in flour yesterday has stopped. On the Chinese factory side, because the current production is not much, in addition to meeting the daily needs of this street, the customers also dislike the high factory prices and have stopped selling invisibly. Most of them have shifted to miscellaneous brand flour. For example, the Japanese factory flour Phoenix brand has caused the sales of local customers since the price fell to 14 yuan and 1 jiao. It is estimated that more than 2,000 bags of goods for this month have been opened, initially at 14 yuan and 2 jiao, and then rose to 14 yuan and 3 jiao and a half, a better 2 jiao to 3 jiao than before. The prices of other miscellaneous brands of flour have also been stable, but there have been no wholesale transactions. The factory price of Lao Che and Fuxin brand flour still needs 16 yuan, and the transaction is only 3,000 to 4,000 bags.</p>
<p>Wheat The market yesterday was the same as before. Because the new goods arriving at Hongkou are mostly on the wharf waiting to be sold, the Japanese factory has had its fill and intends to hoard small and take, while the Chinese factory cannot buy in large quantities due to the bad environment, so buying and selling are being held.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton – Consumption is Weak, Production is Strong, Yarn and Cloth Have Become a Stalemate</h3>
<p>The yarn market is flat and lacks characteristics. Because the actual sales have no hope of great development, and the foreign exchange market has little fluctuation, people are dark and without energy, and speculators have no means to do anything. Thus, the market has become a stalemate. Only a few people have a very optimistic mind. In short, consumption is too weak, and production is strong. Comparing the two sides, it is difficult to balance. According to this observation, if there are no unexpected changes at present, it may be difficult to be very excited.</p>
<p>The yarn market opened in the morning and the atmosphere was still calm. There were few new buyers like morning stars. The opening price was 929 yuan, falling by 5 yuan to 6 yuan compared with the previous day. As soon as the low price opened, the scalpers slightly collected a few bags, and the bidding rose slightly to 936 yuan. The households with short-term thoughts can earn some oil and water work, and seeing the wind make the rudder, they spit out to the outside, and fell back to 932 yuan. Judging from the market situation, everyone is doing scalping transactions. The closing price was 934 yuan. The statistics for the half-day transactions were 1,465 bags. The market price of 20 count Shuangma increased by 2 yuan. The amount of purchases by various gangs is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Hong Kong 655 Fellow firms 810 Statistics 465</p>
<h3>Cotton is as Stagnant as Ever</h3>
<p>Spot cotton transactions are still semi-stagnant. The factory side is quiet. As for the goods previously ordered by the same industry, they have not been sold out, so mutual buying and selling have no excitement. All the morbid states are the same as the yarn market. Fire machine grass bag is 150 yuan, fellow firms traded 180 bags, Indian flower 200 bags, fellow firms entered 200 pieces, all are wharf transactions.</p>
<p>Another report on the foreign cotton market price, the New York cotton market, was firm yesterday. The weather report in the cotton area was bad, and some shorts were covered. As a result, the closing price was 2 to 3 pounds higher than the previous day. The Indian cotton market increased by one rupee on the day including the forecast.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton transaction has been very quiet in recent days. The factory side has slightly added to the shortage of goods, but the number is very small, and most of them are still waiting and seeing. The needs of Japanese manufacturers are also very stagnant.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market – Dutch Red Alone Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday the sugar market weakened again, leading to a small drop. The guild's drawing price, spot 24 coarse white stacks on the upper line of the bank were 67 yuan, 8 jiao to 6 jiao, and in the afternoon it was 67 yuan, 6 jiao and a half, and a small 3 jiao and a half.

<h3>Oil Cakes – The Rise in Raw Oil Has Been Determined</h3>
<p>Yesterday's trend in the peanut oil market, the rise in prices has been killed, because the warehouse has had its fill and is in a state of temporary rest. Yesterday only 20 barrels of Qingdao barrel oil were traded, with a price of 88 yuan on the original plate. Although soybean oil has broken the deadlock, its activity is very little excitement. The state's actual sales are still waiting and seeing. Yesterday, Dalian barrel oil had fallen close to the unofficial price of 22 yuan, with a price of 91 yuan, and 50 loads of Dayouyu factory oil were traded, with a price of 64 yuan and 5 jiao. Today, there are 200 bags of soybeans and 50 pieces of soybean cake being transported to Little Luzon.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods – Domestic Cloth Sales Still Strong, Eastern Piece White Goods Plunge</h3>
<p>Domestic cloth Yesterday, because the Cantonese and Hong Kong gangs still needed goods, although the Eastern piece price fell, the domestic cloth stood still. The prices of white goods and dyed cloth were stable. The street traded more than 300 pieces of grey cloth, fine cloth, and dyed cloth. The Cantonese and Hong Kong gangs handled Jardine Matheson coarse cloth, Shenxin, Yong'an fine cloth fine twill, colored cloth, and colored twill more than 200 pieces, and the Fujian gang handled line flannel, Serge, and Lunchang blue cloth more than 100 pieces. The cloth factory's August and September futures are gradually being traded, with five to six hundred pieces of grey cloth and coarse cloth. Twill velvet futures from Defeng, Qingfeng, Dawei, Xin Yi, and other factories have been opened one after another, and the North Road Yantai and other gangs have loaded out several batches.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth Because the end of the month is approaching, the same industry's silver roots are very tight, and the decline in white goods is increasing. Yesterday, the middle-grade fine cloth of each brand continued to fall by 1 yuan per piece. High-grade Longtou fine cloth Xin stack fell by 7 jiao and a half alone, selling at 27 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, and no one consulted the old stack alone, falling by 2 yuan. The rear market was shouted at 25 yuan and 7 jiao and a half. The Four Gentlemen Serge was still firmer in comparison. The morning market closed at 8 jiao and 4 fen and a half, and the rear market was about 1 jiao and 4 fen.</p>
<h3>Summer Cotton and Wool Goods – Most Have Become a Thing of the Past</h3>
<p>(White Serge) Regardless of thickness or quality, willow twig color, all fell. The Fengyu brand fell especially sharply, because actual sales have passed.</p>
<p>(White Zhigong) The English-made first-class goods are trending better, because they are thin, and the holders do not want to sell at reduced prices. The lower grades and striped white Zhigong, because there are many Shen textiles, the market price is falling daily.</p>
<p>(Police) Because the arrival and storage are full, the production of this factory has exceeded the demand, and the price has been falling continuously for two decades. Yesterday it was still trapped, weak, and although the price was specially reduced, few people consulted. Plain colors are worse than stripes.</p>
<p>(Wan Lieding) The trend is better than other summer wool and other goods. Market sales are not bad, and white, Tibetan, and cyan colors are especially popular, because its actual sales are endless, and there is not much market goods. Yesterday, ordinary English-made goods were still cut and sold at 27 to 8 yuan per yard.</p>
<p>(Ramie Cloth) For genuine ramie, only the sample unpacking gang has some storage, and the price is always firm. Sanjiang ramie cloth, because the price has risen sharply, the customer designation has been sharply reduced, resulting in the previous buyers having surplus, and the market has returned tired by several corners per yard. The sales of this factory's rushing goods woven with wax thread have increased suddenly, but because each family's products are too many and full of the market, the selling prices are now all falling.</p>
<p>(White Canvas) There is a lack of Japanese goods, and the circulation on the market is all Yao factory goods, because the width is the same as 36 inches, and the price is cheaper than Japanese goods. The price is mostly cheap.</p>
<p>(Yellow Twill) The trend is good, because the factory's products are not many, the import of Western goods is extremely scarce, and the demand is not weak, so the selling price is stable. In the recent wool class yarn textiles, it can be said to be the most dominant. Tea green is also good, and the supply and demand are balanced.</p>
<p>(Woolen Serge) The combination of sales in Chinese clothing is softening, and the combination of sales in Western clothing is slightly better, but compared with the trend of ten days ago, it is also falling. Barre Serge is sold similarly to wool serge, but because the quality is firm and many wool textiles are produced, it is rarely heard to be used for Chinese clothing. At present, summer sales are about to pass, and most of them are not as good as before.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods – Large Longan Steadily Rises</h3>
<p>Miscellaneous road longan, the bottom inventory is thin, and there are no arrivals, resulting in large-grained goods becoming increasingly scarce. It is found that Guangfang's hand goods are also not many, so the bank's market has risen by more than 20 yuan. However, the medium and small grains are relatively stable because the demand is limited. New Zhang branches are expected to be released</p>
<p>The first batch of new Zhangzhou branches, because the traffic between Zhangzhou and Gulangyu is stalled, has been delayed in arriving in Shanghai. According to a customer letter yesterday, it is hoped that it will be restored on August 1, and if so, it should be able to ship to Shanghai in early August.</p>
<h3>Coal – White Coal Route Stagnant, Speculators Suffer a Lot</h3>
<p>The white coal market has been declining in recent days. The street transactions are as cold as ever, and the eastern ports are affected by military affairs, and the stomach has stopped, so the market can not avoid step by step returning to decline. Anan white coal, fellow firms since the car, has shouted 206 yuan, the dark market still has a virtual head, old households suffer a lot, the shape presents a tired and unable to give the atmosphere.</p>
<h3>Hardware – Huisheng Iron Market Still Firm, But Actual Sales Are Not Smooth</h3>
<p>The 100-pound American Huisheng iron transaction, recently because the Nanyang gang has no handling, the Tianjin gang rarely purchases, and the Ningbo, Wenzhou, Quanzhou, and Yangtze River road merchants are also rare in the stomach, and actual sales are not smooth. Although the city's factories, toy factories, and printing factories sometimes search for purchases, the number is small, and the entire market is not optimistic. However, because the source is blocked and the Shanghai storage is not abundant, although the market is depressed, the people are still excited, and the market is still firm. The city such as 200-pound new steel factory goods are selling for 155 yuan per box, and the old steel factory goods need 165 yuan per box, and 200-pound narrow strip iron is also sold for about 140 yuan.</p>

<p>U.S. President's Travels (2)</p>
<p>U.S. President Grant served for eight years. Before becoming president, he was in the military during the time of conflict between the Northern and Southern United States. He was invincible on the battlefield, and he was adept at planning and strategy. After becoming president, he focused on ending the war and promoting agriculture, emphasizing trust and harmony. Not only was his ban on the sale of black slaves admirable, but his virtuous policies were also evident to all. After retiring, he traveled to various countries to observe the differences in customs and cultures, and the unique products and climates of different regions. Previously in Hong Kong, many people in Shanghai were already looking forward to his arrival. When he arrived in Shanghai, tens of thousands of people greeted him at the pier. It is said that the president will stay in Shanghai for several days and then go to Beijing to see the magnificence of the imperial palace and the prosperity of the capital before returning to his country. Foreign and Chinese officials and merchants in Shanghai are planning ways to entertain him day and night. The president sometimes walks to the Bund to enjoy the scenery. The president does not exalt himself, but people respect him. The reason why people respect him is not only because of his admirable virtues. Therefore, I praise him: "The illustrious United States, who is its master? The North and South conflicted, who governed them? He served for eight years, then left gracefully. He travels to all countries, and everyone praises him. He stops in Shanghai, and we are fortunate to see him. His demeanor is radiant, and we admire him greatly. I write these words and compose this ode for him."</p>

<h3>A Biased Heart</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>A humble father writes:</p>
<p>"I am not talented, but I am the father of four children. I have always taken family education seriously, but I cannot judge whether I am qualified to be a father. But at least I am not one of those who 'do not know how to be parents, nor will they learn how to be parents.'"</p>
<p>"Reading the above, it seems that I am somewhat qualified to be a father, but I unconsciously tend to be biased towards my children (extremely loving, loving, and unloving). I often think of correcting this, because I deeply feel that the relationship between parents and children is so close that it cannot be casually chosen or discarded like friendship. Favoritism can have extremely bad effects, especially in families with many children and with former and later wives."</p>
<p>A biased heart can be said to be "something everyone has"; it is probably impossible to avoid it completely. However, parents should have a long-term vision in educating their children, aiming to cultivate useful talents for the future world as a permanent goal, and making the cultivation of healthy personalities of their children the ultimate goal. In this way, they will naturally be unwilling to cause any damage or destruction to the good nature of the next generation.</p>
<p>Parents who are biased towards their children should understand the harm of favoritism and try their best to suppress their biased heart, at least not to let it show in their outward actions.</p>
<p>This requires good self-cultivation, knowledge to deal with children, and an understanding of child psychology. This is not easy, but for the sake of the happiness of the next generation of mankind, we should do it!</p>

<h3>Reunion</h3>
<p>— Yan Zheng</p>
<p>I happened to run into Mr. C, a teacher from my alma mater whom I hadn't seen in three years, in a noodle shop.</p>
<p>After nodding hello, I immediately realized that Mr. C was the owner of this noodle shop. I was surprised in my heart, but I didn't want to ask him directly.</p>
<p>At this time, a child of eleven or twelve years old brought me the plain noodles I had ordered. He stole glances at me with a pair of dark eyes.</p>
<p>"This is my second son," Mr. C said to me, pointing at the child. "We do everything ourselves."</p>
<p>I carefully looked at the child, and then looked around: the pockmarked woman kneading dough on the plank table at the entrance; the young man scooping noodles by the stove; the little girl with two pigtails squatting next to the lead bucket washing dishes; all had the same facial features as Mr. C.</p>
<p>"Wonderful! Wonderful!" I said admiringly. "But please tell me, why aren't you teaching at the school anymore?"</p>
<p>"You ask why! Haven't you heard...?" He stared back at me with bright eyes.</p>
<p>"I heard a little, but not in detail," I said.</p>
<p>"The principal wanted to be an official. Several teachers were greedy for profit. When they heard they could get double pay, they all stayed. Only Mr. B and I decided not to do it!"</p>
<p>"Mr. B went to the interior. Because I have so many children, I can only stay here. It's really not easy to find a decent position right now. So I took off my long gown and started this business!"</p>
<p>"It's so admirable that you're like this, Mr. C! So admirable!" I praised him sincerely.</p>
<p>"At first, I hired someone who knew how to knead dough. But when we learned how to do it ourselves, we dismissed him. Look, not bad, right? We can make a living this way."</p>
<p>The business was indeed very good. By this time, the shop was full of people. There were still people standing outside the door, craning their necks to look inside, looking for a place to sit.</p>
<p>Mr. C said, "Excuse me," and ran over. I heard him greeting the customers: "Please wait a moment, it will be ready soon! It will be ready soon!"</p>
<p>I hastily swallowed the noodles. Mr. C's second son deftly handed me a hot towel. I smiled and took it, and asked him, "How old are you?"</p>
<p>"Twelve years old."</p>
<p>When I paid at the counter, Mr. C repeatedly said, "Don't be polite, we're all family." But I finally threw the money on the counter and walked away without looking back. Behind me, his loud laughter flew over.</p>
<p>On the road, my mind was filled with Mr. C's bright eyes, and my ears were filled with his loud laughter. Suddenly, my lips moved, and I recited that old but ever-new sentence: "Wealth and rank cannot corrupt him, poverty and meanness cannot move him, power and force cannot subdue him."</p>
<p>As I recited, my steps became lighter.</p>
<p>The Hawthorne Investigation</p>
<h3>The Dance Queen's Dormitory</h3>
<p>— By Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Four: A Kind of Conjecture</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou's hope did not materialize. He had hoped the old woman would have some more important information, but it turned out to be nothing. Wu Ma was a Yangzhou woman over forty years old, with a plump face, matched with a disproportionately small mouth and small eyes, with a turned-up nose right in the center. If filmed, just having that face on the screen would be enough to make the audience laugh without her even speaking. Not only did her face tell me that her mind wouldn't be very sharp, but because of the excess fat on her body, her movements were also very clumsy. As she stumbled in, her narrow eyes darted around at the three of us, and her hands had nowhere to rest, clutching the corner of her dark blue Haichang cloth old-fashioned short shirt, constantly fidgeting.</p>
<p>Seven or eight out of ten of her answers were "I don't know." In fact, having been there for only two months, she really couldn't comprehend the complex lifestyle of her master. The facts she did know were ones we already knew; the more valuable one was that she confirmed that Zhao Boxiong had indeed come on the evening of the 18th, when she and Jinmei were eating dinner. She had the following description of Zhao Boxiong's state:</p>
<p>"His eyes were bulging, his face was stern, and he spoke in a strange voice, speaking very quietly. When he heard that Miss Wang was not in, he snorted and went back out in a huff. I was so scared by him that a fish bone almost got stuck in my throat!"</p>
<p>In addition, she provided new evidence about Yu Gantang's actions:</p>
<p>She said, "The day before yesterday, on the evening of the 16th, after dinner, when I went out to buy matches and came back, I saw Young Master Yu lurking and peeking around at the door. I greeted him. He seemed startled and quickly told me not to make a sound. He even offered me a banknote, but I didn't take it—I didn't dare to."</p>
<p>Hawthorne asked, "Did he say anything to you?"</p>
<p>Wu Ma said, "He asked me if Miss Wang was in. I told him she wasn't. He also asked if Young Master Zhao had been coming lately. I said he came often. He nodded and quietly walked away again." (55)</p>
<h3>Seven Major Flaws</h3>
<p>— By Xin Fang</p>
<p>Human beings are naturally bound to have flaws, so various kinds of errors often occur in everyone's life. Recently, a Western writer has identified seven major flaws common to mankind, which are now specially translated below for our generation to be wary of.</p>
<p>(1) Limiting personal progress to the principle of causing others to fall.</p>
<p>(2) Often getting upset about things that cannot be changed or corrected.</p>
<p>(3) Insisting that everything is impossible to do due to a lack of ability to accomplish it.</p>
<p>(4) Disregarding ordinary things and focusing on achieving success in great undertakings.</p>
<p>(5) Failing to develop our thoughts and minds through the habit of reading.</p>
<p>(6) Seeking to force others to trust me while hoping that others will not surpass me in life.</p>
<p>(7) Lacking the ability to cultivate the habit of saving money.</p>
<h3>The Responsibility of Teachers</h3>
<p>— By Li Wu Gao</p>
<h3>Is There a Heavenly Father?</h3>
<p>In our previous two articles in this newspaper, we mentioned natural disasters such as the calamities of the material world, floods, earthquakes, and mountain tsunamis, all of which cannot prove that there is no God. Because of these experiences of various disasters, mankind has developed methods of defense and the ability to control them, which in turn proves that there is a God who is creating mankind for the sake of human happiness. Now we want to discuss the difficulties of harmony in the animal world:</p>
<p>(2) Difficulties in the Animal World: People often say that the competition, fear, pain, suffering, and prevalence of disease and death among animals are enough to show God's cruelty and ruthlessness. We have also heard that nature is a large arena, where one animal often preys on and destroys another, which is consistent with the saying "big fish eat small fish, small fish eat worms." It is true that there is suffering and pain among animals, especially among higher and more sensitive animals. But it is not as serious or as frequent as we think. Nor should we assume that the suffering of animals is the same as the suffering of human beings. Because we humans have a kind of self-awareness that animals do not have. Our human memory and imagination are much greater than those of animals. Moreover, many human sufferings are due to an over-intensification of the anticipation of pain. For example, someone suffering from a toothache may anticipate that the pain of pulling the tooth will be even worse than the toothache itself. Animals do not seem to have such anticipations, so their suffering is not as great as that of humans.</p>
<p>It is also not entirely true to say that suffering dominates the natural world. As far as we can see, happiness ultimately outweighs suffering. For example, the sparrows in the trees, the lambs in the fields, and the wild rabbits often live freely and spontaneously. Even in nature, there are disputes and rivalries, but the mutual assistance and love among animals is enough to compensate for it.</p>
<p>What seems to evoke a sense of cruelty in the natural world is simply the problem of death. But death itself is a condition for the progress of both mankind and the animal kingdom. If there were no death, there would be no new life. If the living were to live forever, the happiness of life would be limited to the enjoyment of a few and could not be distributed to many descendants.</p>
<p>Modern science teaches us that suffering in nature has its meaning. This suffering is the path to obtaining security, survival, and preservation of the animal kingdom, and it is also an indispensable element in the overall system of the organic world, to satisfy God's great benevolent purpose. All these phenomena that are seen as painful by humans are God's arranged plans for the universe. Before we casually say that a benevolent and wise God is not good, we should always hesitate a little, adopt a skeptical attitude, and avoid the mockery of "blind men describing an elephant."

<h3>Another New Contribution to Film History: Automatic Voice Changer</h3>
<p>— By Xiande</p>
<p>The general public always feels unable to fully understand foreign films, the only reason being the language barrier. Therefore, many people are burying their heads in research, trying to find ways to improve it. Until recently, a Hollywood filmmaker, playwright, and physicist named Gilbert Wright spent two years of effort inventing a "Sonovox" automatic voice-changing machine, thus solving this problem. As for his motivation for researching this machine:</p>
<p>Motivation</p>
<p>It was like this: Once, Wright was supervising a film, in which there was a plot where a murderer, when escaping on a train, needed the wheels to emit a condemning sound of "You killed her! You killed her!" According to ordinary methods, that would only require recording the sound of the wheels on the one hand and adding the required human voice on the other. But Wright did not think so, he hoped that the wheels themselves could emit that needed sound. Many engineers thought it was impossible, but Wright relied on his knowledge of acoustics and electricity to finally achieve his goal. The</p>
<p>Appearance</p>
<p>of this machine is very simple and exquisite, there is only a sound box like a phonograph, and two biscuit-shaped vibrating plates connected to it with electric wires. As for the internal structure and principles, because it cannot be explained in a few words, I will not discuss it further here. Although this machine has a simple appearance, its</p>
<p>Function</p>
<p>is very broad. It can turn the Italian you speak into English; it can turn your hoarse singing voice into a clear one; therefore, after using this voice changer, anyone can understand the plays performed by foreign actors in their own language, and there will no longer be any need for any explanation on the screen. Undoubtedly, this machine will cause a major change in film history, like the advancement from silent films to sound films. This kind of</p>
<p>Voice Changing</p>
<p>device, in addition to being used in film, can also serve people who cannot speak due to illness or unfortunate accidents, allowing them to express their opinions with their mouths like everyone else. So this is also good news for the deaf and mute.</p>
<h3>British War Films Screened in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— By Jinhuang</p>
<p>Mr. Alexander, Counselor of the British Embassy, recently hosted a screening of the latest war vehicle films at the British Women's Association Hall in the HSBC Building, inviting people from all walks of life to visit, and prepared exquisite cold drinks on the roof of the building for the guests. The evening breeze was gentle, and the summer heat was gone, and the guests and hosts were all happy.</p>
<p>The films screened all depicted the latest movements of the British army, navy, and air force, some of which were filmed during the battle, which was truly valuable. It began with the ranks of troops from Canada, Australia, and other places, followed by various exercises and combat situations in the African desert. The work of British aviation schools and ordnance factories, air combat and air force bombing of tank formations, etc., were all shown on the screen, as well as many wonderful shots, such as German planes bombing moving British and French troops, the Battle of Narvik, and the air raid on Namsos. Finally, there were the joint efforts of the British and French forces in escorting Dutch refugees during the bombing, the situation of Belgium being destroyed, and the joint operations of the navy and air force, which were quite wonderful, and the audience praised them endlessly.</p>
<h3>Teapot Songs</h3>
<p>— Shaoqing</p>
<p>Watching Tan Fuying and Chen Lifang perform The Metamorphosis (Continued)</p>
<p>There were many high-pitched tunes flipped that day, which won a lot of applause. After a five-minute break, "Sangyuanhui" opened. Starting with the Luo woman reciting the introduction, Qiuhu's disguise and singing the next scene was omitted, saving time. Chen Lifang played Luo, her singing and acting purely learned from Cheng Yanqiu, her water sleeve skills were extremely good and could be mistaken for the real thing. Her voice was wider and brighter than when she sang "Nv Qijie" in the bubble opera on the first day, and her singing and acting were both well-rounded. Tan Fuying played Qiuhu, singing "Qiuhu Da Ma Ben Jiaxiang" [Qiuhu Rides Home on Horseback], flowing rhythm. Listening to his voice, it was also faster and smoother than before. "Qiuhu Ta Ba Liangxin Sang" [Qiuhu Has Lost His Conscience], inverted rhythm, singing the old tune, indeed adhering to the rules. Continuing to sing the Xibei inverted rhythm, there were quite a few good tunes, the sound was both broad and loud, and every sentence could be heard clearly. "Wo Quan Ta Huijia Ta Bu Wang" [I Advise Him to Go Home But He Does Not], one sentence, he sang the "Ta" character in one breath, the breath was sufficient and the spirit was complete. The duet quick beat segments were also extremely familiar. "Da Bu Gai Zai Sangyuan Tiaoxi Ta" [Should Not Have Teased Her in the Mulberry Garden] was sung in a flipped high pitch and was the most wonderful. Fuying's performance in this play was good in both singing and acting. He acted lively and spirited that day and was very popular with the audience. Listening closely to his singing in this play, there was no sound of a sad and declining tune, which was truly extraordinary. I most agree with this point. Since it is not a tragedy, why use a sad sound? Moreover, Qiuhu wears a black three-beard and is not very old, and the title is "Teasing His Wife," so there is even less need for sadness. Fuying knows the plot and understands the Sichuan sound. However, I think that Fuying has such a good voice and should further study the phonetics. Now I will give three characters that seem inappropriate: First, the "Hong Niang Xing" [Lying to My Mother] "Hong" character, the mouth is too open, and the ending sound is not clear; second, the "Ta Bu Wang" [He Does Not Go] "Wang" character, after using the tune, the rhyme should not change greatly. Now listening to the Jiangyang rhyme's vowel, every time there are several tones changed, this is a great taboo in singing. I heard that Fuying had this small flaw ten years ago, and I suspected that it was caused by his voice not recovering. Now his voice is smooth and his breath is sufficient, so why not urgently seek to change it? Third, the "Tiaoxi Ta" [Teasing Her] "Tiao" character, Yangping tone, should not use the "Fan" character high note. This is different from the word "Zao" [Disaster] in "Zhuo Fang Zao Huoyang" [Catching and Releasing Causes Disaster], which has a Yinping tone and should not be used with the "Fan" character sound uniformly. However, a high note should actually be used here to increase the momentum. In my humble opinion, if the "Tiao" character is changed to the "Yao" character with a rising tone, it would be suitable for using a high note. The performance of "Dayu Shajia" [The Fisherman's Revenge] started close to eleven o'clock. Because of the limited time, everyone rushed through the performance like they were snatching a play, so I will save ink and not discuss it.</p>
