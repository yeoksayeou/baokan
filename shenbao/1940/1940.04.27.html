<h3 id="c9">外股投機 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>自洋　股票成爲投機目標之後，遂有不少股份，市價與其面值之比，增加六七倍，乃至一二十倍者；如中國墾植股，票面爲銀二兩五錢、而昨日市價三十三元；如會德豐股，票面爲銀十兩，而廿二日做開之最高價爲二百七十二元；此外如英聯船塢股，票面爲國幣十元，市價爲五十七元五角；鋼業股，票面爲國幣五元，市價爲四十三元；祥泰木行股，票面爲銀十兩，市價爲六十二元；此皆市上最活躍之股票。其他持有前項股票之公司，其股票　隨其所有之股票而升降；如國際信托揚子上海等兩銀公司，持有大宗會德豐股票，故會德豐之股票漲，亦漲；跌，亦跌；桴鼓相應，不爽累黍，此則變熊之尤也。</p>
<p>大凡股票之漲跌，繫於其財產之增减變化。試觀上述股票之公司，確屬其營業因物價之飛漲，而有優厚之股息，然此不僅洋商公司爲然，華商公司工廠盈餘固無不然，且有過之者。或以爲由法幣之反應而然，其實上述各種股票，均非外幣，乃爲銀兩及國幣計值之股票，固與中國其他各公司股票相同也。藉日，資產照目前之物價，以爲估計，大有增進，此則基於幣值觀念，固無與於資產本身之價值。若爲其營業將來，勝算在握；股息所派，超越於今，因之紛起吸收，市價飛漲，誠如此說，又焉知未來股息之必八倍十倍於常時乎？</p>
<p>夫以正常之目光，論非常之投機，宜其如枘鑿之不相容。蓋今之買賣股票也，非爲投資，乃爲投機。投機在買賣兩種價格間差金之獲得爲空，但望其一跌再跌，做多只望其大漲特漲而後其所獲愈豐。初不問股票本身之眞價值如何，只要有人買賣，如民十之父易所股票，未開幕而已先漲，非果有業務利鈍之可言也。則今之買賣外股者，尙有相當利益可沾，趨之若騖宜也。然若注意股息之有無，猶不脫投資之見解。投機即停業之公司股票，亦有起而搜羅，此進彼出，價格升降，不問其將來是否爲廢紙也，有謂今所買賣之外股，其公司固營業如舊且在發展中也，焉得視爲投機。而不知交易之是否爲投機，應以其行爲而論；如會德豐股一星期中自一百四十三元高至二百七十二元，所漲幾及一倍；及至翌日一跌五十元，狂漲大跌，豈其公司營業在一星期中有極大之變動乎，夫人而知其不然。大凡投機所利用者，一在其有機之可投，蓋投機必有所假借，方可以鼓動人心，施展手腕。其决爲空爲多，必有所組織，策動於後，方可以圖一逞。其三又必求所投機之股票本身，明其優劣之所在，利用之爲操縱之工具，如股分少者，易爲多方所操縱是也。善於投機者其出入常不易捉摸，明爲多頭而行動有如空頭；虛則實之，實則虛之，將欲取之，必先與之，人棄，我取，人取，我與，不一其方式，此固投機者所運用以獵致大利在也。雖然，亦必有其條件，必先之以聯絡一致之做手，爲正爲負，使人若墮五里霧中，而惟其目的相對之方面是投。且必具有可資週轉之財力，以應付一切。亦必先事進取，而後造成空氣，使人信以爲眞。總之，投機之術。詭變多端，以投機爲生者猶未必盡利，而肓從之投機，適爲眞正投機者造機曾而已。</p>
<p>現在市塲上但聞獲利之聲，此亦不僅外股爲然，以有進無退之物價，有貨者莫不有利。一般但知有利之可獲也，不問其事實，日進亦進，日退亦退，試問其進退何所依據也，恐亦茫然不知所謂，人云亦云，第知如此而已矣。此則求之於市塲，占大多數，而不自知人方以大利相誘惑，及一旦入其殼中，人利轉將爲彼所獲也。且人人獲利，利固何來？此則不外兩途，如物品則囤戶操縱所獲之厚利，最後之榨取，剝削於一般消費者身上。若如股票買賣，亦人入獲利，其最後負担之損失，必爲最後以高價買進之一人。明於此，世固無有以投機致富者，有之，亦且以投機喪其財，悖入悖出，理固如是。况有進無退之物價，亦無可久長之理。及人之大慾已塡，反動之來，固有不可測度者也。夫以高價買進之股票，原思再得高價以賣出，從而覓利。設投機所造成之高價，劃然中止，欲售不得，欲藏小能，屆時進退失據，狼狽不堪之情形，無非今日一念之貪所造成之也。則不顧一切而跟隨投機者，宜可廢然思返矣。</p>

<p>重慶週來華軍與日軍在開封·晋南·曁南昌附近、相繼展開大規模之戰鬥、華軍以主動攻勢、向日澈底殲擊、戰幕揭開以來、克地復城、無往不利、發揮最光輝之勝利戰果、捷報傳出，舉國騰歡、尤以行都人士、最爲興奮、中央社記者特於今晨往訪某軍事發言人、叩詢華各戰區英勇健兒殲日致果、經過與意義、承分告如下、</p>
<p>開封</p>
<p>方面、豫東華軍於上週開始在開封附近完成周密佈署、於廿二晚乘日不備之際大舉攻至開封四郊、經三小時搏鬥、華軍大隊攻入汴垣、翌晨並另有三路相繼攻入城內、當晚發牛巷衢搏鬥、華進城先頭部隊、將日司令部攻佔、繼續人城大軍、乃分別掃蕩困匿民房之殘日、直至下午六時、城內日軍完全殲滅、無一生還、內中軍官尤多、日在城內之物質損失極重、於廿三日上午起、日由數方面紛向開封增援、以隴海綫爲主幹、但該綫交通巳爲華完全破壞、迄目下止、日尙無法由此路進兵、日新修之汁新鐵路、亦被華澈底破壞日無法利用、惟黃河北岸日之交通未及遮斷、致日於廿三日下午、由新鄕一帶增援、到達開對附近、當在開封北郊發生激戰、日圖再據汁垣心切、同時由太康朱仙鎭各地積極增援、故在開封城西城南與華部隊接觸、戰况猛烈、華另一路部隊於攻入開封之同時、一舉攻克淮陽、盡殲該處困日、開封附近戰局、截至現在止、尙無何新階段、相信華軍決有把握、將在開封近郊再造一最驚人戰果、關於華在汴城部隊、據悉並無確保開封之意、第迄無退出開封之報吿傳來、依判斷、於昨晨起、華城內部隊當有一部參加城郊作戰、</p>
<p>晋南</p>

<p>美國孟綠博士、昨日下午四時半、乘庇亞士總統號輪由港抵滬、孟祿博士在上月中、會遊歷「自由中國」、渠稱、所獲印象極佳、且保證中國在此次抗戰中、必可擊敗日本、而達到「抗戰必勝建國必成」之目的、孟祿博士皤然老翁、兩鬢巳霜、但精神　鑠、言談之間、充分表現渠對中國前途表示樂觀之意、茲誌其談話於後、</p>
<p>遍游各地印象極佳</p>
<p>孟祿博士稱、渠前會抵美一行、在華盛頓曾竭全力、促使美政府對中國續作信用貸款、渠此次遍遊「自由中國」後、所獲印象極佳、認爲中國決可戰勝日本、而達到抗戰之最終目的、至於蔣委員長及中國政府大員、對於此次抗戰、均堅信將以消耗戰略、使日本於長期戰爭中陷於慘敗、目前中國政府以及人民、均有抗戰必勝之一致信念、所有之農民·工人。以及兵士、對中國政府之信任、巳十倍於往昔、而彼等因愛國心之激發、團結一致、爲政府之後盾、</p>
<p>自足自給不虞匱乏</p>
<p>孟祿博士繼稱、當渠遊歷「自由中國」時、渠巳獲得中國能自足自給之鐵證、各地均遍設工廠、出品數量、較前大增、尤足注意者、爲中國目前巳能自行製造軍火、證中國之人民、巳能各盡其力、對抗日本之侵略、某日氏會遇一老翁、對人指其五歲之小兒而言曰、「十年以後、彼可爲國效勞矣、」氏又會見一中國農婦、聲稱、「目前中國巳完全醒悟、」凡此種種、均足以證明中國之前途、誠屬無限光明也、</p>
<p>一面建設一面抗戰</p>
<p>孟祿博士認為印象最深者、厥爲內地有如許衆多之智識靑年及學生、爲國效勞、渠稱、「回溯往昔、人皆認爲中國留學生歸國後、大半無用、蓋彼等所學習之技術知識、均不適台中國社會也、今則不然、留外學生及技術人才、已爲政府急切需要、自戰事爆發、中國一面建設、一面抗戰、技術人才之重要、巳爲社會所公認、」中國足以戰勝日本之另一因素、爲廣大之人力、渠稱、「在川時、處處行人擁擠、融融如也、當余經過日本時、並無此種景况、」</p>
<p>膠着戰鬥消耗日軍</p>
<p>博士又稱「在此次旅行中、余雖未親見戰塲之景象、但日人之戰略、幾盡襲用舊法、即在「自由中國」之境、作直綫之進展、而日軍所侵佔之區域內、往往受中國空軍不斷之轟炸、而遭受重大之打擊、華軍方面、均望日軍勿放棄所侵佔之土地、而爲膠着之戰鬥、蓋非如此、終難以達消耗敵人之目的也」、</p>
<p>各國亟應加緊援華</p>
<p>最後博士稱、「余認爲西方國家應迅速加緊援華、貸予中國巨款、此種舉動、對日本決非不友誼之行爲、蓋對日本不友誼之舉動、為對日禁運是也、孟祿博士稱、渠此次返美、當盡力促使美人援華、貸中國以巨款、使中國能繼續抗戰、獲得放後勝利」、</p>

<p>新訂規例</p>
<p>又訊昨自英海軍權城方面探悉、英政府巳制定新規律、繼續徵用行駛中國沿海各口岸之英商輪隻、將於下月一日起付諸實施、在此規律下、受影響最大者、厥爲怡和及太古兩船輪公司、其他各英商輪船公司、將亦因此而受相當影響、另據航業界方面稱、新規律實施後之情形、並非如一般所預料之嚴重、蓋英商輪隻、決不致因此而完全停頓也、據談、所有輪隻、不致完全被調往歐洲、且不致調離遠東、新規律將包括兩點、一爲英輪完全由政府徵用、調往歐洲或其他地帶服務、一則爲由英政府加以統制、仍任各輪繼續行駛原定航綫、</p>

<p>自本月十七日納稅西人年會議決、擴大工部局經濟委員會之組織、使之國際化、委員由四人增至十二人、除中英美日之原有四人外、再由四國各增加一人、並參加法德意荷各一人、該會之任務爲研究臧政、委員人選、亦可於下週中全部產生、茲誌詳情於後、</p>
<p>負責研究减政方案</p>
<p>據華董某氏談、工部局經濟委員會之設置、係負責研究工部局臧政之方法、務使臧政以後、不致影響其行政效率、詳言之、即研究（一）如何使市政管理趨於合理化、（二）工部局雖實行减政、而不致妨害其行政效率、（三）任用居住上海之西人及華人、以替代由歐洲而來之西人、（四）審查有關係之文件、就通盤情形、予以精密之審查、研究討論、然後製成一報吿、供工部局董事會參考、嗣經實施、該會任務、即吿終了、</p>
<p>經濟委會前亦設立</p>
<p>在五六年前、工部局即有此項臨時性質之委員會設置、其時主席即係前總董樊克令、當時研究减政結果、當减縮支出一百餘萬元、惟自八一三後、幣價跌落、西人職員增付鉅額外滙津貼、去年糧食飛漲、華人職員、復支給米貼、前所减縮之一百餘萬元、至此與之抵銷、尙且不敷、故局方一面決定於下年度加捐、一面接受各方建議、設置經濟委員會、並擴大其組織、俾再研究合理的减政辦法、</p>
<p>目前組織臨時性質</p>
<p>至該項組織、即謂係財務委員會之擴大組織、則係誤會緣工部局董事會下設有常設之小組委員會若干、董事會遇有須交付審查之案件、即就其性質、分別交付某一小組會審查、財務委員會即爲此種常設小組委員會之一、此外、遇有臨時發生事件、必要時得設置臨時小組委員會、至其任務終了、宣吿結束、人力車夫委員會、即係一例、經濟委員會性質、即與常設委員會有別、</p>
<p>委員人選下週產生</p>
<p>該會各國委員人選、除華籍兩人、業由納稅華人會推由虞洽卿·奚玉書·兩氏担任外、其餘各國委員、現正由各國僑民推選之中、據接近租界當局方面稱、該項全體委員名單、可望於下週之中發表、並信英董鮑威爾及日董岡本一策、均將人選、</p>
<p>局方又裁西員多人</p>
<p>工部局昨日所發表之公報、會公布被裁職員名單、據調查結果、除前外間業已獲悉之被裁人員外、又有一人、亦在被裁之列、該人爲公路工程師潘多、在工部局中服務、巳有二十七年之久、如今渠巳接獲退職通知、而須於兩月內離去、又據獲悉、工部局各部人員、目前對裁員問題、尙不甚了了、蓋裁員與退休兩詞、巳混淆不淸也、彼等對此且極恐慌、蓋不知是否在最近期內、亦將遭受同樣之厄運也、被裁職員遺缺，前曾傳由猶太難民櫃任、嗣工部局正式予以吾認、惟昨日向可靠方面探悉、汽車工程師華德斐被裁後、業已由猶太難民四人遞補其職、又訊、被裁人員中、工務處共有九人之多、另一則爲情報處主任福蘭善、彼等均係於三月二十九日前後接獲退職通知、而於二十四小時後、即行離職、至於其名單、除　多外、尙有拜林頓·方伯羅·霍浦金·奈脫·傑遜·寇爾·斯衛乞夫堪·湯姆士·華德斐諸人、公報又復載稱尙有若干警務人員、亦將退休、</p>
<h3 id="c70">日本競爭對華貿易　已遇重大困難　滬日商欲與第三國競爭　要求剔出日圓集團之外 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>壓低日幣價值又恐日軍部不許</p>
<p>最近在滬日商近曾迭次集議討論長江開放後、日本與第三國之商務競爭問題、現已要求政府、將華中尤其上海一區、剔出日圓集團之外、俾能儘量與第三國競爭、聞日本對華貿易、現遭遇重大困難、</p>
<p>日鈔泛濫</p>
<p>至其原因、則爲日鈔在華之泛濫、日方如欲維持其貨幣在華之地位、至少須以物資爲後盾、任憑在華日商以日鈔匯款回國購貨、但照此辦理、日本貨物、潮湧來華結果必加緊日本國內物價之騰貴、而使日圓在華價值提高、此種辦法、自爲日政府所不取、寗願將此貨物運往第三國、易取外匯、但如對華貿易完全剔出日圓集團之外、</p>
<p>搜羅外滙</p>

<p>大中社云、本埠難民收容所、共計二十四處、所收容之難民、據前次救世軍領袖毛立斯談稱、將完全設法遣散、茲據探悉、在過去數星期中、約有難民三萬人、平均每日四百人、巳被遣散、工部局方面、對此將組織專門委員會、專司其事、目前此項工作、係由難民救濟協會及救世軍擔任、每一被遣散之難民、均給以相當津貼、成人十五元、十六歲以下者十元、務使彼等能返抵故鄉、務晨或爲他種營生、所困難者、爲此種難民領得若干遣散津貼、並不即行離滬返鄉、而仍流落滬濱、終至淪爲乞丐、對於社會、仍將增加其負擔、工部局方面有鑒及此、故計劃從事組織特種委員會、專事調杳被遣散之難民、是否確巳離滬、或在滬已覓得職業、不致有淪落天涯之虞、</p>
<p>遣散以後</p>
<p>毛立斯及袁履登氏、對遣散難民之前途、均認爲未許樂觀、蓋難民中必有無數耗盡津貼、重又流浪街頭、淪爲乞丐者也、毛立斯氏更指稱、有若干難民、遣散之後、即有難關、即爲在此人烟稠密之城市、將不能有一住所、關於此點、據謂將由工部局設法解決、而工部局組職之特種委員會、對遣散問題、及因遣散而引起之各項問題、均將盡最大之努力、加以解決、又據毛立斯氏談、惇信路難民收容听內難民、全部遣散後、該所仍將保留、作爲收容老弱殘廢之用、在最近未能遣散完妥之難民、則由延平路收容所暫予收容、然後冉行設法、又特種委員會之工作、目前所能決定之最具體者、爲代難民購得船票或車票、務使彼等能返歸故鄕、目前被遣散之難民、均未經工部局予以援助、故多有留居滬郊、未有返歸故鄕者、</p>
<p>淪為乞丐</p>
<p>據工部局副總裁納許氏稱、遣散在滬難民中之困難問題、厥為難民之中、由滬郊流浪來此者、爲數不尠、遣散之後、固可於短時期內返抵故鄕、但若鄕間無以爲生、則勢將重爲海上飄泊者、而形成滬上乞丐問題之嚴重性、故當務之急、當爲乞丐問題、目前在滬乞丐總數、尙未有準確之統計、但據一般之估計、其數當在難民人數之上也、蓋由捕房方面在街頭發現之乞丐、及慈善機關所收容之乞丐屍體數目推測之、巳足證明此說之不虛、</p>
<p>給養拮据</p>
<p>除被遣散之難民外、留於滬上者、尙有五千至一萬名之老弱殘廢者、須予給養、此項估計、昨日由救世軍領袖毛立斯予以證實、又據袁履登氏昨日宣稱、目前救難經費、每月約須三〇〇·〇〇〇元、但目前各方捐輸、不過二〇〇·〇〇〇元、生活水準之高漲、巳使此項問題日趨嚴重、二年前、每月每一難民給養僅須二元、今則巳增至六元之多、去歲救難經費收入總數爲四·五〇〇·〇〇〇元、而支出僅四·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、泊乎今歲、情形大不如前矣、</p>

<p>米市處前朝又告回昆後、昨則無論賣買雙方、心思續堅、因之各色洋米價再度造成漲風、盈通來洋米情形、逈異往昔、不專賴於實銷、彷彿交易所以賣空買空爲事、雖市塲通吿取締、無非遮掩　外人耳目、欺世盜名耳、從事投機者、依然用民食作「皮球」言之可恨、當前關高昂時、一般空頭爲數頗夥、而在前兩朝尙認跌勢未殺、滿懷熱望、詎市隔一朝即又回緊勢不能敵、急謀補進、故晨間未待開市、即巳問詢、思求　廉佔先、及開盤搜羅史亟、一時造成客販良機、扳俏益力、喊聲迭起、其間再兼內地鄉莊客戶及店胃點綴、市色愈鮮倏忍間各貨行情巳猛提一元半光景、際此價格已高、補進心思漸衰、共他銷塲相隨見懈、大勢方始稍挫、市氣又呈下游、計將近午、巳回貶近元、然市多變化、殊難捉摸、迨一度低落、補空復起、形勢又見栗落、迨至收市、未稍遜色、結果收盤行情、較之前市增高元半、</p>
<p>又訊、洋米連朝回降後、昨巳引起客幫之實胃、會由汕頭廈門天津各幫辦裝五六千包、外傳有臺灣幫辦去五千包者、實係日商自行辦運之貨、惟市面與人心均被鼓動、高次各米、一致飛升、尤以小絞米進出兩旺、漲勢最厲、前日四十元〇九角者、昨乃昂至四十二元半、惟午後有獲利出籠、又被新成交二號西貢影響、收市祇四十二元一角、其他西西貢暹羅各米、上午均漲元外、下午均小四五角、二號西貢四五月份則一路上升、開價五十三元、漲至五十三元半、新成二號西貢五百噸、外傳二千五百噸、價爲五十三元及五十一元九角、回籠成交三百多噸、現洋米一萬餘包，</p>

<p>麵粉　昨日客幫銷塲、因出口問題、尙未疏通、客銷暫時失望、本街交易、又因邇日內地粉逐有運到、一部份粉號大都搭銷雜牌粉、致本街零批亦丙之臧少、統市由廠方直接批出者僅四五千包、二號粉廠盤仍須十三元八角、老車牌回籠貨價爲十三元七角、比前日又小五分、聞常錫內地粉價在十三元三四角、貨方因當地粉價較廉、恐尙有繼續運滬傾銷云、</p>

<p>和尙拚性命募化</p>
<p>杭垣得勝橋地方，總名曰夾城巷，向有金剛寺，為宋南渡時遺趾，固莊嚴巨鐔也。乾嘉時某僧，相傳功行圓滿飛昇而去，迄今耆老猶能言之。自赭寇擾浙，寺遂被燬，現惟頹垣敗壁而已。去冬有老僧卓錫，於此立志恢復舊規，重興土木，乃募化多時，迄無就緒。招得僧徒一二人，互相商議，謂非得驚人之事，哄動城鄉，斷不能獲鉅款。老僧年已七旬餘，行將就木，擬拼一死，以成此宏願，但得山門重整，可奉老僧為開山之祖，於願足矣。徒輩皆欣然受教。僧乃於數月前，先自到處揚言，預示死期，且　湼槃後之三日，須即焚化，遲則有礙昇天云云。故是日善男信女，俱施金錢，以結善果，豈知仁錢兩邑尊，亦早聞知，先以為僧道歛錢之故智，置之不問，及聞送死者太盛，遂於次日各帶幹役仵作人等，同至該處親騐，至則男婦　途，焚香頂禮者，不可勝計，立召其徒面訊，則以功成昇天對。邑尊見高臺下，滿置積薪，臺上則一龕高置，龕之四面畢封閉，須施及多金者，方得列名。僧自定於十六夜焚化，故徒輩欲待　時而舉火。邢邑尊疑其服毒自盡，故神其說，欲開龕檢騐，周邑尊以為彼旣圓寂，無庸再視，但三日內焚化，未免太速，當令其遲至七日後，再觀動靜。遂飭其徒，如違重究，一面密囑差役，日夜輪流看守。</p>

<h3 id="c119">生活的科學 <a href="#c119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>心理學家安德婁（A.Adler）博士曾著生活的科學（Science　of　Living）一書，從教育與心理的立塲，把生活中的三個重要問題—社會問題，職業問題，戀愛問題，—作了一個適宜的指示，是一冊通俗而實用的好書。</p>
<p>安氏的研究個別心理學和發展心理學的權威學者，他的著述很受人推重。在這本書內，他對於「自卑情結」（Inferiority　Complex）與「自高情結」（Superiority　Complex）和生活的影響，敘說極爲精闢，的確予我們的實際生活以不少的指導。他認爲人類心理上的變態行爲，完全棨源於兒童期的環境的不良，教育者亟應注意訓練兒童，培養他們健全的心理，並須盡量發展其社會興趣，把他們的情緒，導向有益的方面去。這恰合近代心理衛生的要旨。</p>
<p>近世心理學的研究，已有切近生活應用的趨勢，這種專門的學術，對於人類生活的改進，實有很大的貢獻。心理學上的重大發現，多由實際的需要而產生，許多理論和實驗，幫助我們解決了很多的生活上的問題，不但精神病患者的變態行爲，需要心理學的研究，予以補救與防止，即和日常生活最有關係的意志，情緒，習慣，思維等亦不得不採用心理學的原則，以解決困難問題。</p>
<p>傳統觀念以爲生活和科學是毫無聯繫的，科學只在探求自然與社會環境的原理，是一種純粹的學術研究，他們忘了科學的應用方面。心理學既是獨立的科學，牠的研究，自應以解決生活的疑難爲依歸。人類的生活將因心理學的研究，而變得更有意義，更有價值。我們的生活內容因以豐富，生活方式因以改進，使生活成爲一種最合理最崇高的活動，把一切生活中的陳腐的渣滓濾清了，揚棄了。正如安氏所說：「這種科學（指心理學）自然是偏重實用的，因爲我們有了知識的輔助，便可以改變並且矯正我們的態度。」</p>
<p>生活的範圍很廣，包括人類所有的一切活動。心理學家多謂生活是一種有目的的表現。糊塗的隨便的混日子，而沒有確切的目標，那不能算是適當的生活態度。理想的生活應該有教育的價值，不僅在發展自己，而且在改進社會造福人羣。所以人類的生活的最高作用，就在隨時隨地的作客觀的自我批判，不斷地尋找生活的缺點，加以改變與矯正，因此我們就得多多吸收生活的知識了。</p>
<p>我們的四圍儘多生活在沮喪愁悶憂鬱消極中的人們，他們缺乏生活的信仰與熱忱，以致頹唐消沈，徬徨無依。除非亟早覺醒，吸取並提揀和生活改進有關係的科學知識，根除萎靡不振的惡習，培養健全常態的情緒，充實生活的意義，發揮內在的潛力，就將永遠地陷於無底的黑暗的深淵而無自拔之日了。</p>

<h3 id="c120">溫暖的可愛 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— 丁蓮芳</p>
<p>暮春時節，又是江南草長鶯飛的季節了。大地上得到了溫暖，一切都像蘇醒過來的樣子。「一年之計在於春」，就是因爲春天溫暖，便做事，所以格外顯得重要。除掉人，溫暖給與其他動植物也有許多好處。世界上的生物，以溫帶爲最多，而且是最發達。花草都在春天萌動，飛禽走獸在春天便格外顯得活潑。依心理學家研究的結果，知道太冷太熱都能使人注意減少。故世界上最文明繁榮的便是溫帶。溫帶上偉人多，貢獻多，發明多。哲學家羅素要在太陽下寫文章，詩人拜惀怕冷，像羊一樣。密爾頓的失樂園是在春天寫成的，哥德的詩在秋天寫成。有人統計世界偉大的文學作品，五月　多，其次是四月，九月，而以一月，十月，十二月，二月爲最少。</p>
<p>除了氣候的溫暖而外，心靈的溫暖也是極其可貴。一家人樂叙天倫，身心都感到莫大的快慰。對事業有興味，也可使心靈溫暖。「日間不作虛心事，半夜高門我不驚。」這當然是因心靈溫暖而泰適。良師益友的接觸，人與人之間感情的融洽，這更是心靈的溫暖。</p>
<p>溫暖可以使我們感覺人生快樂，可以使我們處世積極。所以我們要及時努力，不要放棄了自然界給予我們的溫暖光陰。同時，更不應糟塌或遺棄了心靈上所需要的溫暖。</p>
<h3 id="c121">上帝高於一切　（三） <a href="#c121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>你是否以上帝爲首，這個分別，曾弄明白嗎？若你信托上帝，你就會信托同人。愛上帝，就會愛同人，信上帝就會信這個世界是上帝的家，你爲一位慈父的兒女。信上帝是偉大的，創造的，聰明的，權能，在宇宙之間，他不住的工作，你便信公正，德備，愛心，是世上最大勢力。信上帝，你便確信忠實，信心，愛心，有價值必得最後勝利。這樣的信心，能使你應付世上一切困難和失望，因爲你相信「是」可以勝「非，」「真」可以勝「假，」「愛」可以勝「惡，」永生可以勝過死亡。一個人懷著上帝的意識做人，他的態度，始終是勝利的態度。不論何事臨頭，他總是無畏無愧的去應付。上帝扶持他，照顧他到底，因爲他是上帝永遠旨意的一部分。在宗教史上最令人震驚的一個時候，有一位流亡在外不知名的先知，寫了這幾句偉大的話，「等候耶和華的，必從新得力，他們必如鷹展翅上勝，他們奔跑，却不困倦，行走卻不疲乏。希伯來人被放逐回來，要重建他們精神的文化，要更新他們信仰的基礎，於是那位先知，把他們領到上帝面前，使他們預備做那種工作。你們等到上帝，能使力量增加，得着從未有過的權能。他告訴他們，將上帝列在工作之前，有三事可見，即能飛，能跑，能走。換言之，與上帝親近，能得無窮鼓勵，不論際遇如何，能絕對無畏，應付一切。我們要學習不倦不餒的走人生之路。今日世界的希望，是在人裹面找出上帝，並從生活上表現出來。（完）　如欲詳細研究請函郵箱1227號</p>
<p>家庭</p>
<h3 id="c122">婚後自述 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— 瑾</p>
<p>我記得，當我懷著美麗的夢，愉快的心境結婚的時候，我想不到我現在會遇到這樣許多看了不順眼，聽了不順耳的事情，單就我們倆的愛情言，雖不能說我們的愛情言，雖不能說我們的愛情已走入了墳墓，但愛情已不再能鼓舞起我們，使我們身心都沉醉在裹面了。</p>
<p>他每天大清早起身，怱怱吃了早點，在八時一定要趕到辦公室裏去的。我陪他起來也好，不陪他起來也好，因爲他對於我熱忱的關切似乎已不放在心上了。要是在婚前，即使我陪他多走一段路，他也高興得感謝不止。他每晚六點後回家，回家拖着一個疲倦的身子往床上一倒，根本沒有什麼話和我說。「談心」更說不上了。我們之間已沒有體貼，溫順，我們所有的關係完全建築在夫妻的名義上了。</p>
<p>對於我，這是多麼使我難受啊！我並不是說我一定需要愛情，沒有愛情不能生活似的。但是，我現在的生活裹，太沒有感情了，一切都是冷酷的，我和人之間衹有名的關係吧了。一個活潑的少女，忽然闲在這一種永遠冰天雪地般的家庭裏，她精神上的寂寞和痛苦是不能形容的，她的改變當然也不待說了。</p>
<p>在我自己家裏，我有父母兄弟姊妹，我們是熱鬧的，我的家庭是有生氣的，我的生命好似一直放着異常的光彩。我們家庭裏的一團和氣，一團熱情，使我對生命懷着無限的希望和愉快。當我認識了他以後，我更覺得生活充實了，我就好像生活在愛的迷霧裏，到處是甜蜜：我幻想着，要是和他結了婚，我一切不是更美滿了嗎？誰知我們一結了婚，一切的事情都不是我所曾經想到的，我當初忽略了我是要被放在另外一個環境裏生活的。</p>
<p>你看看我現在的家庭吧。我有婆翁，叔伯，姑嫂等一大羣人。這完全是一個道地的中國典型的大家庭了。他們看我是一個陌生人，他們對我當然發生不了什麼感情。非但如此，他們還覺得多了一個我，家庭裏多了一份嚕囌似的。雖然我從沒有直接和他們有什麼意見上的衝突。一早起身，我做我的事情，他上他的公事房，以後一直到晚上，每天，每天，我是如此地挨過着我寶貴的青春光陰。我更不大高興沒有什麼事隨便走出房門一步。房門外面的世界是冷冰冰的，太虛偽了；他們也不大喜歡我，都說我是新法女子，在沒有必要的時候，他們不隨便和我交談，這在我是求之不得。說良心話，和這一大堆人除了說敷衍話以外，簡直和他們無話可說了。他們都自認是老法人，和我新法女子配不上來，我真不懂，我新法在什麼地方呢？</p>

<h3 id="c123">志願 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— 如</p>
<p>年少不立志，老大無成就。</p>
<p>什麼叫做志願？各人的解說怕很多吧？許多人都是沒有志願的，他們所有的只是如何活命而已，換句話說即：「得過且過」而已。</p>
<p>一個人在某一時代有某一時代的志願，少年時代的志願到中年就會改變，中年時代的志願到老年也會變樣；志願永遠不變的人是很少的，若有，這種人定是英雄或偉人了。</p>
<p>光有志願是無用的，「志願」所需要的是「行動」和「努力」，尤其　乎要有「恒心」，如果，這四件一一齊備，那末成功之門就開好了等人進去了「時間」是志願的敵人，略一放鬆，「時間老人兒」偷偷溜過，再偉大的志願也成爲泡影。</p>
<p>你有志願，默默的做去就是了，等到成功了，自然大家敬佩你。若有了志願不去專心促其實現，却一味在嘴上說來說去，向人誇耀，如是人家將因你的有志願而感覺討厭無窮。</p>
<p>有些人的志願是很值得佩服的，爲什麼呢？就是因爲他們有知不可爲而爲之的精神，或是立奪正大，絕不希望自己享受志願成功後的美果。許多革命偉人，在外國如意大利的瑪志尼，俄羅斯的列寗，和中國的文大祥史可法，近代的孫中山黃克强等都是這類的人物。</p>
<p>許多人嘴裏說不怕吃苦，必要實現自己的志願，其實等到他的志願尙未完成一半的時候，他已轉變了態度。洪承疇吳三桂之流在幼小時候，何嘗不想頂天立地的做個堂堂正正的人？一到利祿關頭，人格也可犧牲了，民族國家也可奉送了，假是早死數年，誰會說他們不是好人呢？</p>

<p>— 小田</p>
<p>文姬歸漢，爲程硯秋名劇之一，唱工繁重，爲諸劇之冠。前乎此，未有演者，後乎此，演者之技，遠不迨程，未足置評也。</p>
<p>唱工中之節奏，其體裁最正式，規模最偉大，格局最謹嚴，而占全劇中强大之重要性者，莫如慢三眼。此劇於最後三塲中，連唱西皮二黃反二黃三大段慢三眼，其吃力費噪，不言可知，故硯秋亦不肯輕易演唱。前此二度來滬，每貼此劇，余必往聽，唱至祭昭君墓之反二黃特，輒現氣衰力疲之象，此次則雖至末段搖板，尙餘勇可賈，蓋見硯秋之工力，又進步矣。</p>
<p>此劇事績，僅蔡文姬遭亂被擄，逼嫁左賢王，遇贖歸國本無十分興趣。而全劇情緒，又祇有一悲字，寡居是悲，遭亂被擄亦悲，居胡思鄉，歸國思千，無一非悲，渦昭君墓而興同病相憐之感，非悲而何。做戲易，表情難，表悲歡離合喜怒哀樂更迭之情易，表一字到底之情難，蓋寡居與離亂之悲，思鄕與思子之悲，悲雖同，而其所以興悲之感則異也。硯秋似已了解斯意，學程者能體味斯意乎，觀衆能領略斯意乎？</p>
<p>此劇編排之塲子有一塲余殊未能司意，然亦別無善法處置硯秋似應設法安排，使其更臻完美。當李榷班師回朝之後，緊接一塲，即爲曹操坐帳，其間時期已相隔十餘年矣，非熟讀三國者，詎知李榷常國與曹操當國之時代耶？此在電影，則可於其間下一字幕，標明十餘年後，在京戲則絕對不可能，或將侍兒與二小主子一塲，移隔其間，然後再上曹操，不知又似嫌脫節否。</p>

<h3 id="e9">Speculation in Foreign Stocks <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Since foreign stocks have become the target of speculation, many stocks have increased in market price by six or seven times, or even ten or twenty times, compared to their face value. For example, the China Land Reclamation shares have a face value of two taels and five qian of silver, but the market price yesterday was thirty-three yuan. As for Jardine Matheson shares, the face value is ten taels of silver, and the highest price on the 22nd was two hundred and seventy-two yuan. In addition, the Taikoo Dockyard shares have a face value of ten yuan in national currency, and the market price is fifty-seven yuan and five jiao. The Steel Industry shares have a face value of five yuan in national currency, and the market price is forty-three yuan. The Jardine Matheson Timber shares have a face value of ten taels of silver, and the market price is sixty-two yuan. These are all the most actively traded stocks on the market. Other companies holding the aforementioned stocks, their stocks fluctuate along with the stocks they hold. For example, international trust, Yangzi, Shanghai and other silver companies hold a large number of Jardine Matheson stocks, so Jardine Matheson's stock rises when the former rises, and falls when the former falls. The relationship is like a drum and its beat, with no deviation. This is the extreme of "riding the bear."</p>
<p>Generally, the rise and fall of stocks depend on the increase or decrease of their assets. Looking at the companies of the aforementioned stocks, it is true that their business has generous dividends due to the soaring prices, but this is not only true for foreign companies, Chinese companies and factories certainly have profits, and even more so. Some believe that this is due to the response of legal tender, but in fact, the aforementioned stocks are not in foreign currency, but are stocks valued in silver and national currency, which is the same as other Chinese company stocks. Granted that assets are estimated based on current prices, there is a large increase, but this is based on the concept of currency value, and has nothing to do with the value of the assets themselves. If their future business prospects are guaranteed, and the dividends paid will exceed those of today, hence the rush to buy and the soaring market price, if that is the case, how can it be known that future dividends will necessarily be eight or ten times the normal rate?</p>
<p>It is like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole to use a normal perspective to comment on extraordinary speculation. Buying and selling stocks today is not for investment, but for speculation. Speculation aims to profit from the price difference between buying and selling, hoping for a continuous drop when shorting, and hoping for a big rise when going long, so that the profit is greater. It does not matter what the true value of the stock itself is, as long as there is someone buying and selling, just like the stocks of the Shanghai Stock Exchange in the early years of the Republic of China, which rose before the opening, not because there were profits or losses to speak of. So, buying and selling foreign stocks now still has considerable profits to be made, so it is reasonable to rush to it. However, paying attention to whether there are dividends is still an investment perspective. Even the stocks of companies that are going out of business are searched for in speculation, with one person selling and another buying, the price rises and falls, regardless of whether they will be waste paper in the future. Some say that the foreign stocks being bought and sold today, their companies are still operating as usual and are developing, so how can they be regarded as speculation? But it is not known whether a transaction is speculative should be based on its behavior. For example, Jardine Matheson shares rose from 143 yuan to 272 yuan in a week, a rise of almost double. But the next day, it fell by fifty yuan, a wild rise and a big fall. Could it be that the company's business had a huge change in a week? Everyone knows that this is not the case. Generally, speculation relies on the opportunity to speculate. Speculation must have something to rely on in order to stir up people's hearts and use tricks. The decision to short or go long must be organized and planned behind the scenes in order to achieve success. Thirdly, it is also necessary to understand the advantages and disadvantages of the stocks being speculated on, and use them as tools for manipulation, such as shares with fewer being easily manipulated by multiple parties. Those who are good at speculation often have unpredictable entries and exits, pretending to be bullish while acting bearish, making the virtual real and the real virtual, giving before taking, taking what others abandon, and giving what others take, in countless ways. This is what speculators use to hunt for huge profits. However, there must also be conditions, first with a united team of operators, acting positive or negative, confusing people like falling into a five-mile fog, and only the opposite side of their purpose is targeted. And they must have the financial resources to cope with everything. They must also take the initiative in advance and then create an atmosphere to make people believe it is true. In short, the art of speculation is full of tricks. Even those who make a living from speculation may not always profit, and blindly following speculation is just creating opportunities for real speculators.</p>
<p>At present, the market is full of talk of profits. This is not only true for foreign stocks, but also for the prices of goods that only increase and never decrease, anyone with goods will profit. In general, people only know that there are profits to be made, regardless of the facts, and advance or retreat every day. But what is the basis for these advances and retreats? I am afraid they do not know at all, and just follow what others say. This is what is found in the market for the majority of people, and they do not realize that people are tempting them with great profits, and once they enter their trap, their profits will be taken away by others. And if everyone is making profits, where do the profits come from? There are only two ways: for goods, the huge profits made by hoarders are ultimately extracted from the general consumers. As for stock trading, if everyone is making profits, the final burden of loss will be borne by the one who buys in at a high price last. Understanding this, the world certainly has no one who gets rich by speculation. If there are, they will also lose their wealth through speculation. Ill-gotten gains never prosper. Moreover, prices that only increase and never decrease cannot last for long. When people's desires are filled, the reaction will be unpredictable. Those who buy stocks at high prices originally thought of selling them at even higher prices to make a profit. If the high price created by speculation suddenly stops, they cannot sell them, and they cannot keep them, the situation of being unable to advance or retreat will be extremely embarrassing, all caused by today's greed. Those who follow speculation regardless of everything should seriously reflect on themselves.</p>

<p>Chongqing: Over the past week, the Chinese and Japanese armies have successively launched large-scale battles in the vicinity of Kaifeng, southern Shanxi, and Nanchang. The Chinese army launched a proactive offensive to thoroughly annihilate the Japanese. Since the beginning of the war, they have conquered land and recovered cities, achieving great successes and demonstrating the most brilliant victory results. The good news has spread, and the whole country is rejoicing, especially the people of the capital. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited a military spokesman this morning to inquire about the process and significance of the Chinese soldiers' heroic annihilation of the Japanese in various war zones. The spokesman explained the following:</p>
<p>Kaifeng</p>
<p>On the Henan front, the Chinese army in eastern Henan began to complete a thorough deployment near Kaifeng last week. On the night of the 22nd, taking advantage of the Japanese unpreparedness, they launched a major offensive on the four suburbs of Kaifeng. After three hours of fighting, the main force of the Chinese army stormed into the walls of Kaifeng. The next morning, three more routes stormed into the city successively. Street fighting broke out that night. The advanced troops of the Chinese army that entered the city captured the Japanese headquarters and continued to mop up the remaining Japanese hiding in the houses of the people. By 6:00 PM, the Japanese army in the city was completely annihilated, with no survivors. Many officers were among them. The material losses of the Japanese in the city were extremely heavy. From the morning of the 23rd, the Japanese sent reinforcements from various directions to Kaifeng, mainly along the Longhai Railway. However, the traffic on this line has been completely destroyed by the Chinese, and so far, the Japanese have been unable to advance along this road. The newly built Jixin Railway by the Japanese has also been thoroughly destroyed by the Chinese, and the Japanese cannot use it. However, the Japanese traffic on the north bank of the Yellow River has not been cut off, causing the Japanese to send reinforcements from Xinxiang and other areas on the afternoon of the 23rd, arriving near Kaifeng. Fierce fighting broke out in the northern suburbs of Kaifeng. The Japanese were eager to reoccupy the walls, and actively sent reinforcements from Taikang and Zhuxian Town, so they contacted the Chinese troops in the west and south of Kaifeng. The fighting was fierce. Another unit of the Chinese army captured Huaiyang in one fell swoop while attacking Kaifeng, annihilating all the surrounded Japanese there. The situation near Kaifeng, as of now, has not entered any new phase. It is believed that the Chinese army is determined to create another most shocking victory near Kaifeng. Regarding the Chinese troops in Bian City, it is understood that there is no intention to ensure the defense of Kaifeng, but no report has been received of their withdrawal from Kaifeng. Judging from the situation, a part of the Chinese troops inside the city has been participating in the fighting in the suburbs since yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Southern Shanxi</p>
<p>In the area between the Zhongtiao Mountains and the Taihang Mountains, the Japanese attempted to launch a large-scale offensive. The number of troops and the ambition were more significant than in any previous operation. Since the 11th, the Japanese have attacked southward along five routes: (1) In Xiaxian, Anyi, and Yuncheng, the Japanese attacked Pinglu and Maojin, occupying Pinglu on the 18th. The Chinese troops near Pinglu gave the Japanese a heavy blow, driving most of the Japanese in the suburbs into the city. The remaining Japanese are still stubbornly defending. The Chinese army continued to advance northward to cut off their retreat. (2) Maojin Ferry also fell on the 18th. The Chinese army recovered the area that afternoon. The victorious Chinese troops continued to pursue the routed Japanese. Currently, the Chinese army is engaged in a seesaw battle with the Japanese in the area east of the main road between Zhangdian Town and Maojin Ferry. The fighting is fierce. As of yesterday morning, all the Japanese had been defeated and were retreating. A few remaining Japanese were retreating northeast. (3) The Japanese in Yicheng attacked Nakamura and Zhangma Town, attempting to attack in the direction of Yuanqu. Since the 18th, the Chinese and Japanese armies have engaged in fierce fighting in the area around Nakamura and Zhangma Town. The Chinese fortifications in the area are solid, and the terrain is extremely advantageous to the Chinese, so the Japanese army has suffered heavy casualties. Fighting is still ongoing. (4) The Japanese in Changzi and Changzhi attacked southward, advancing to the vicinity of Xihuo Town and Jianning Town on the 20th, where they engaged in bloody battles with the Chinese army. By dawn on the 21st, the Japanese broke out from Dayi Town and were intercepted by the Chinese near Gaoping, and were attacked on the side and rear. By the 23rd, over 10,000 Japanese troops on this route had been completely defeated by the Chinese in the northwest of Gaoping. (5) At noon on the 21st, over 3,000 Japanese attacked Zhengcun, forcibly crossing the Qin River. The Chinese took advantage of the Japanese's halfway crossing, suddenly launching a fierce attack, killing more than half of the Japanese. The remaining Japanese were defeated and retreated and are currently confronting each other across the river. In short, this battle in southern Shanxi is extremely complicated. On the surface, the Japanese attacked southward along five routes, but in reality, there were as many as nine routes. But no matter how fiercely the Japanese attack, it is safe to say that the result will be a very heavy defeat. What's more, the Japanese are already showing an irreversible decline.</p>
<p>Nanchang</p>
<p>After the Chinese army recovered Anyi and Wanshou Palace, the Japanese in Nanchang fell into an irrecoverable state. The Japanese constantly reinforced and counterattacked the Chinese. The victorious Chinese troops continued to surround and attack the Japanese, launching a sustained and fierce battle. The Japanese recently sent reinforcements from Jiujiang, part of which has arrived in Nanchang. Since the 22nd, they have attacked fiercely along two routes: one route fought near Wanjiabu, west of Anyi, and the other fought near Shengmi Street, east of Wanshou Palace. The fighting was fierce, unprecedented. After the Chinese recovered Xiangtang, south of Nanchang, the Chinese soldiers took advantage of the momentum to attack Liantang. The Japanese in Nanchang felt a major threat. At the same time, the Chinese continued to attack Jiujiang and the various troops along the Nanxun Road, launching a fierce attack on Xiushui yesterday, making good progress. As the situation has developed to this point, the war around Nanchang is still continuing to develop under the strong control of the Chinese army. (Telegram, 26th)</p>

<p>Chongqing: Moscow, 25th - The Moscow Bolshevik newspaper recently published an article entitled "The Unsubmissive Republic of China," stating that China's war of resistance has experienced great hardship, but the Chinese people's noble patriotism has been inspired by this. All 450 million people are under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, defending against the enemy. The Chinese government's outstanding economic measures have made northwest and southwest China new industrial centers. The Chinese industrial cooperative movement has made great contributions. The Chinese government's financial reforms have been especially beneficial to the improvement of the domestic industrial and agricultural economy. The National Government led by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek enjoys the support of the people of the whole country. The end of those who rely on Japanese bayonets is undoubtedly tragic failure. China's war of resistance has lasted for three years. Japanese imperialism's manpower and resources have been exhausted, while China continues to fight calmly to achieve its sacred purpose. This is truly admirable. (Telegram, 26th)</p>

<p>Chongqing: Today, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that, according to information received by the Ministry, most countries in the world have expressed their decision not to recognize the "New Regime." After the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to various countries on March 30 clarifying the attitude of the National Government, it also instructed Chinese diplomatic envoys overseas to report the attitude of various countries on this matter. According to the reports received so far, the United States, Cuba, Mexico, Peru, and the Dominican Republic have all firmly announced their decision not to recognize the "New Regime." Editorials in official Soviet publications and statements in the British House of Commons have also indicated that they will continue to recognize Chongqing as the National Government of China. The spokesperson also solemnly stated that, because the note issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not request a response, the failure of some countries to respond or issue any formal documents cannot be regarded as considering recognition of the "New Regime." In fact, several other countries will soon issue similar declarations, reiterating their policy of recognizing the Chongqing government. (Reuters telegram, 26th)</p>

<p>Chongqing: Since the first air raid this year, over 100,000 residents of Chongqing have withdrawn outside the city during the past four months. This withdrawal has reduced the number of residents in Chongqing to 260,000. The air defense authorities consider this number to be the maximum number of residents that should remain in the city. The air raid on Monday has intensified air defense work even more. Currently, 3,000 stonemasons are working day and night in the mountains, rushing to build air raid shelters. The crowding in the air raid trenches last year did not occur this week. The increase in stone caves has made it unnecessary for residents to go to the air raid trenches again. During this week, important businesses are still operating as usual during the day and in the evening. (United Press telegram, 26th)</p>

<h3 id="e25">The Japanese Military Acts Autocratically, Controlling Wartime Industrial Profits; This Move Disrupts the Entire Economic System and Has Caused Great Agitation Among Capitalists <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo - The Japanese military recently announced suddenly that it has decided to control profits from today onwards so that wartime industries do not obtain excessive surpluses. This undertaking has caused great shock in political and business circles. It is noted that the Japanese military's goals in adopting this measure are as follows: (1) to supervise profits, (2) to improve factory production methods, (3) to unify manufacturing methods, and (4) to increase production efficiency, thereby reducing production costs. Therefore, before implementing this measure, a detailed investigation of the internal situation of various manufacturers will be conducted. At the same time, the munitions industry will also be reorganized to serve as a model for other industries. The newspapers here are paying close attention to this, but they are unanimously criticizing the price policy adopted by Minister of Commerce and Industry Ginjiro Fujiwara and the economic policy of the Yonai Cabinet. "Miyako Shimbun" stated, "The military's plan is truly a major revolution in the financial world." The military's newspaper "Kokumin Shimbun" stated, "The military's decision is a major correction to the industrial concept of free capitalism. If controlling profits can achieve results, then the entire economic system will be completely transformed. However, according to the military's main goal, it is not to implement anti-capitalist control, but to implement new policies to improve production efficiency." (April 25th, Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>The Hague - Lieutenant Commander Newbolt, Principal of the Higher Naval Academy, recently gave a lecture at the academy on the subject of the Dutch East Indies, advocating the construction of three powerful battlecruisers to strengthen the defense there. He stated, "Our troops stationed in the Dutch East Indies are weak and insufficient to cope with the tasks they are responsible for. Some say that having a strong air force is enough to deter enemy landings, but this is not entirely true. If there are no troops stationed along the coast, or if there are troops but they are small in number, then defense is just empty talk. The Allied forces of Britain and France were able to land in Norwegian coastal ports despite being heavily bombed by German aircraft, which serves as proof. If maritime supremacy is in the hands of the enemy, then even if we order the air force to bomb them when they attempt to land, we will not be able to stop them. Therefore, if the Indian Ocean is under enemy control, then we will not be able to defend the Dutch East Indies, even if we want to. The only way to do this is to build battlecruisers to strengthen our defense. If we have three such warships, then under the current naval balance in the Pacific, it will be impossible for any party to attack the Dutch East Indies." (April 26th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>London - The "Daily Telegraph" Washington dispatch recently stated that the Dutch Ambassador to the United States, Mr. [Name], earnestly believes that the rumor that the Netherlands asked Britain to raise the issue of the future of the Dutch East Indies is aimed at pulling the United States into the war from behind. After contacting the Dutch government, the ambassador stated that the statement that Britain is responsible for raising the issue of the future of the Dutch East Indies does not represent the opinion of the Dutch government. (April 26th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Moscow - The Soviet "Red Star" newspaper today published an article on the Dutch East Indies issue, titled "The Struggle for the Dutch East Indies." The article stated, "So far, the debate among imperialist powers over the division of the Dutch East Indies is only on a small scale, but this debate has proven that important and serious conflicts will occur among imperialists in the Pacific. In Europe, the possibility of the Netherlands' neutrality being broken has become even more obvious, and thus it has extended to the Pacific. British, American, and Japanese politicians are now making statements on this issue, and their main points are concentrated on the Dutch East Indies, because it is the richest Dutch colony in the Pacific. Japan is Britain's main competitor in the Dutch East Indies. Japan's expansion in the South China Sea has caused unease in London. Recent statements by Japanese newspapers and some Japanese government officials prove that the Dutch East Indies will become Japan's target for expansion. Japanese newspapers have also clearly stated that Japan will not hesitate to use force against Britain and the United States over the Dutch East Indies issue. At the same time, Japan will never allow the Dutch East Indies to become a British or American protectorate. The United States also wants to occupy the Dutch East Indies and does not want to lose the current opportunity. The United States has openly stated that they are willing to control the Dry Tortugas and the Caribbean Islands. They also oppose Japan seizing the Dutch East Indies, because if Japan occupies the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines will be in a dangerous position." (April 25th, TASS dispatch)</p>

A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied, "No such negotiations are currently underway between the two countries. Regarding the rumor that the import of Japanese goods into French Morocco is restricted, the Japanese government has not taken any action. The Franco-Japanese commercial treaty has been extended by one month until May 15 to allow France and Japan to conduct negotiations on the conclusion of a new commercial treaty, but there have been no talks between the two governments. The various aspects of Franco-Japanese trade, including the Moroccan issue, will be discussed when the talks begin." (April 26th, Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>London - According to news received here today, the Allied forces in the Steinkjer area are now defending positions about four miles north of the city. Observing the situation, it does not appear that the German army is launching any attacks. The general opinion here is that the troops mentioned in last night's War Office communiqué landed in Namsos. The vanguard sent by the British commander appears to have been moving towards Trondheim, attacked by German troops landing from German destroyers, and retreated, but the extent of the losses and troop strength are still unclear. However, it seems that this vanguard would not have carried heavy artillery or anti-aircraft guns. According to news received here, the Østerdalen valley has been closed off, and large numbers of Norwegian troops have destroyed bridges and roads to prevent the German army from advancing and establishing contact with the German army in Trondheim. There is no news from Narvik today, but the extremely bad weather in the past 24 hours may be the reason why there has been no activity on either side. (April 26th, Reuters dispatch)</p>

When the German army advanced rapidly towards the area, it used tanks, armored vehicles, and motorcycles. It is reported that two German tanks have been destroyed. It is reported that Allied forces now occupy the important railway junction of Støren, so the northern exit of Østerdalen has been blocked.

<p>London - A special dispatch from here states that the British newspapers are still using the development of the Norwegian war as their main source of information, saying that the Norwegian military situation was never expected to be easy from the beginning, because the German troops' sudden invasion of Norway had already gained military strongholds, including airfields, before the arrival of the Allied forces. The Allied troops' withdrawal from the positions near Lillehammer should not be considered a defeat, but a halt. According to recent Swedish news, Allied reinforcements have moved from Dombås along the Gudbrandsdalen valley. According to the opinions of various military correspondents, an orderly retreat can inflict great losses on the enemy and force them to constantly deploy their troops in their advance. The newspapers all believe that the German army is using bombers as its main weapon in this campaign, so the Allies should establish air bases in Norway as soon as possible.

<p>Somewhere in Norway - The Norwegian Telegraph Agency announced that German bombers circled over the mountains and bays of western Norway all day yesterday, bombing villages and towns and strafing civilians with machine guns. However, there were few deaths and injuries, and the damage was also light. When German aircraft attacked Åndalsnes, one was shot down. It is heard that the bombs dropped by German aircraft in the mountains were far from military targets, and their sole purpose was often civilians. Residents of various cities and towns are at a loss as to whether to evacuate or not because German aircraft are constantly harassing them everywhere. The people of Norway are extremely indignant at this form of "protection" from Germany, and their determination to resist the enemy is becoming stronger and stronger.

<p>London - It has been learned that the British expeditionary force was repulsed by German troops when it attacked Trondheim, Norway, yesterday. The Daily Express recently published an account of its withdrawal, which stated, in brief, that according to reliable sources, when British troops landed at Namsos some days ago, the Germans were quite alarmed by their sudden arrival. The Allied Command took advantage of this weakness of the enemy and, without waiting for full preparation, sent three battalions of British troops on a forced march, attempting to take Trondheim in one fell swoop. At that time, they did not send a small reconnaissance team to probe the enemy's true situation first. These three battalions of British troops attacked without encountering any resistance and marched straight ahead until they reached the city of Steinkjer, where they met the German troops who had quickly marched north from Trondheim. The German troops had already built fortifications there, so after arriving at their destination, they relied on these fortifications to resist stubbornly. The British troops lacked reinforcements and were attacked from the flanks by German special forces landing from Trondheim Bay, in addition to which the Germans used aircraft to bomb them heavily, and their warships anchored in the bay also opened fire. The three battalions of British troops were only carrying rifles and machine guns, so it was difficult for them to resist. Therefore, they reorganized and withdrew several miles to wait for the main force to arrive before attacking again. The above is the truth about the British troops' brief retreat yesterday.

<p>Stockholm - Well-informed sources here recently stated that the news of yesterday's battles, especially the news issued by German propaganda organs, is very worrying, but judging from the battle reports received from various sources today, the situation has become more optimistic. The Allied forces and the German army are now fighting fiercely for Trondheim, because the port is one of the strategic strongholds of Norway, so they are sparing no effort to fight for it. At this moment, the German side only has superiority in the air force, but according to the latest news, the Allied forces are preparing to fully mobilize the air force to fight the Germans. An aircraft carrier has already sailed to a port in Norway, and an air force base is being built somewhere, but the authorities are still keeping the location a secret. Today, the Hegra Fortress in central Norway was attacked by German aircraft again and again, while on the Allied side, the German air force base at Værnes (which is the German aircraft base in northern Norway) was bombed continuously. Recently, a large number of aircraft and military supplies have been transported to Norway. Judging from the fact that the German air force's repeated bombings of Namsos have not succeeded, it can be seen that the Allied forces are not only prepared in the air force, but their anti-aircraft gun teams are also extremely effective. A British cruiser has also repeatedly shelled important German strongholds and has been quite successful. The close cooperation of the British and French fleets with the land and air forces is enough to make the German efforts come to naught. As for the German use of aircraft to transport troops and military supplies, there is no need to overemphasize it, because Allied aircraft may not be unable to have a decisive force in future battles. According to reliable sources, British troops have advanced towards Røros, and fighting is also taking place in the Støren area. The number of French troops landing in Norwegian ports is equivalent to that of the British expeditionary force. (April 26th, Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>New York: The current situation of the war in Norway was commented on by the Democratic Party's New York Times, which stated that the British government's communiqué had already admitted that the expeditionary force had to withdraw from Lillehammer due to being outnumbered. "Although this setback is significant in nature, it is not the key to the victory or defeat of the war in Norway." For Britain and France, the crux of the current problem lies in how to use the air force. "If an air base cannot be found in Norway, aircraft carriers must be deployed to park on the Norwegian sea. Without the help of the air force, even if Britain and France have control at sea, and even if their troops are extremely brave and determined to drive the Germans out of the Scandinavian Peninsula, they will still be difficult to succeed."

In the snowy and muddy climate of Norway in April, it was difficult to win against the powerful German army, and it was undoubtedly a major military blunder. After four days of combat, most of the troops had been lost.

Ten of our destroyers, led by the battleship "Warspite" (31,000 tons displacement), participated in the battle. One enemy destroyer was surrounded by four of our ships.

<h3 id="e42">British Admiralty Releases Details of Naval Battle, Seven German Ships Destroyed, Three British Ships Also Damaged <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>London: The British Admiralty released a communiqué last night, detailing the second naval battle between British and German forces in Narvik on the 13th of this month. It stated that at noon on April 13th, it was cloudy with fog and drizzling rain. A team of British ships sailed past the end of West Bay to Ottenfjord and Narvik. The fleet included the destroyers "Icarus," "Hero," "Foxhound," "Kimberley," "Forrester," the Tribal-class destroyers "Bedouin," "Punjabi," "Eskimo," "Cossack," and the battleship "Warspite," commanded by Vice Admiral Whitworth. The battleship's voyage through the narrow waters to Narvik was a heroic feat of great danger, as it was known that German destroyers were lying in ambush in the bay. Although aerial reconnaissance by British aircraft and escort by destroyers had reduced the danger, no one knew what kind of traps the Germans had set. At 12:26, a German destroyer appeared through the fog. Four British destroyers opened fire on it, and the enemy ship turned away. At 12:45, another German destroyer appeared, followed by others. The first German destroyer resisted stubbornly, but was subjected to fierce artillery fire from the "Icarus" and three Tribal-class destroyers. Eight minutes later, the German ship caught fire in the middle and rear, but continued to fire back until its guns were destroyed by the "Warspite." At that time, enemy destroyers continued to appear, totaling six, zigzagging in front of the British ships, and fierce fighting broke out. Each ship fired rapidly and changed course frequently to avoid enemy fire. At this time, German ships fired and landed close to the British ships, but the British ships' tactics were skillful and none were hit. A German Heinkel bomber arrived, but flew out of the range of the artillery fire. Then the two sides fought and moved, and the enemy ships always retreated, gradually showing signs of injury. The half-hour after 2:00 pm was the decisive period of the battle. According to a report from the bridge of a British destroyer, at 1:30, an enemy ship was hit and severely damaged. At 2:03, the ship caught fire and was also hit by a torpedo. Another place caught fire. At 2:14, another enemy ship caught fire. At 2:24, the second enemy ship that caught fire exploded for the second time, followed by another German destroyer exploding for the second time. The battle seemed to be over at this point, but four German destroyers fled upstream to Rombaksfjord, releasing smoke to block the British ships. At 2:30, one of the enemy ships had become a burning wreck. Another enemy ship was floating north of Narvik, and its crew had abandoned ship and swam ashore. The third enemy ship ran aground, and the remaining ships took refuge in Rombaksfjord. While the destroyers were fighting, the "Warspite" shelled the shore batteries at a range of less than half a mile, and the "Cossack" also assisted in the shelling, destroying a German howitzer. The "Punjabi" and "Bedouin" followed the "Cossack" and opened fire. At this time, other destroyers sailed up Rombaksfjord in pursuit of the enemy ships. The bay is ten miles long and has a narrow neck 100 yards wide. When the "Eskimo" sailed through the narrow neck, it was attacked by a wounded and grounded German destroyer. The "Eskimo" immediately returned fire, destroying the German ship, but it was slightly damaged itself. When other British destroyers sailed through the narrow neck, they saw that the enemy ship was burning from stem to stern. Therefore, the "Hero" took the lead and accompanied the central ship forward, passing another bend to explore the situation. They saw three German destroyers moored in an ice-bound bay. One of them seemed intact and undamaged, but there was no movement on the ship. The second ship only had its bow exposed above the water, and the third ship was burning. The "Hero" and "Kimberley" fired a few shots, but stopped quickly because the enemy ships did not return fire. At this time, the British ships sent armed sailors in small boats to investigate. They saw that the first enemy ship, which seemed intact and undamaged, was slowly sinking, having been scuttled. The British soldiers then boarded the last German ship, which was burning. This ship was named "Ruedesheim." The British soldiers tore down the German flag and replaced it with a white flag. They found only one wounded officer on the ship, who had been placed on a stretcher, ready to leave the ship. But the "Hero" arrived and the German crew fled without taking him with them. The British soldiers then transferred the wounded German officer to the "Hero." The fire on the German ship was so intense that it could not be saved. The "Hero" then fired a torpedo and sank this seventh German ship. All seven German destroyers were destroyed at this point, and the shore batteries were silenced. Three British ships were damaged and immediately withdrew, leaving the "Ivanhoe" and "Kimberley" to occupy the bay. The "Ivanhoe" sent armed soldiers ashore to take care of a hospital and a school, as British wounded soldiers were being treated there. At night, 120 German soldiers entered the town and surrendered to 24 British soldiers. When the landing British soldiers returned to their ships, at the request of the Norwegian authorities, they supplied the mostly fishermen Norwegians with Lee-Enfield rifles and ammunition to prevent the German prisoners from escaping.

<p>Berlin: German war correspondent Stadtde described the situation of the air raid on Sylt Island from the night of the 23rd to the morning of the 24th. He said that when the first British plane approached Sylt Island, the ground searchlights searched the air, and the anti-aircraft artillery prepared to fire. A few minutes later, the British plane was surrounded by searchlight beams. Although the British plane collided from side to side, it could not fly out of the range of the searchlights, giving the anti-aircraft artillery a clear target. The anti-aircraft shells exploded around the enemy plane, and the sparks flew, creating a spectacular sight. The enemy plane knew it was in a dangerous situation and wanted to reduce the weight of the bombs it was carrying in an attempt to escape, so it dropped the bombs on the ground aimlessly, but still did not succeed. One plane's engine was hit and destroyed at sea, another fell straight from the air into the sea, and the third caught fire and exploded in the air. Other planes dared not fly close to Sylt Island, dropped their bombs into the sea, and then fled. (Haitong dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Berlin: German officials yesterday met with a reporter from the Haitong News Agency and stated that the German Supreme Command has reached an intolerable limit because the enemy's bombing has reached undefended towns, such as the bombing of the Hörnum station on the coast of Holstein by British planes on April 12, and the bombing of the residential area of Oslo on the night of April 22. The German Air Force is still adhering to the order not to bomb non-military targets. If Britain carries out indiscriminate bombing, the German Air Force will eventually take retaliatory measures.

<p>Warm Springs, Georgia: President Roosevelt announced here yesterday the existence of a state of war between Norway and Germany and declared the application of the US Neutrality Act. This Neutrality Act prohibits any submarines of belligerent nations from entering US ports and territorial waters, and implements the "cash and carry" provision of the Neutrality Act for Norway, as well as other laws applicable to belligerent nations, including provisions regarding the issuance of securities in the United States. However, the President did not mention Denmark. (United Press dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Washington: Under the provisions of the Neutrality Act, President Roosevelt reluctantly announced today that Norway and Germany are in a state of war. Therefore, the cash-and-carry provisions and other restrictions that had previously been applied to the Allied Powers and Germany must also be implemented for Norway. Roosevelt signed this proclamation on a mild spring day. As Roosevelt's pen moved, Norway's hope of resisting German aggression by borrowing US credit became a fantasy. Official sources said that before the German attack on Norway, the Export-Import Bank had allocated $10 million in loans to Norway, which must now be cancelled unless Congress takes any remedial measures. The Norwegian government, which was once considered a reliable borrower in the world, must now adhere to the cash-and-carry principle in order to obtain goods from the United States. In fact, since Roosevelt designated the entire Scandinavian region as a war zone, the shipment of Norwegian goods by American ships has been prohibited. Moreover, banks are considered to be acting illegally on behalf of Norway, and all American groups raising funds to help Norway must submit their monthly accounts to Secretary of State Hull for review. As for Hull himself, he immediately issued various regulations after President Roosevelt signed the above proclamation, the same as those previously issued to deal with Britain, France, Germany, and Poland, prohibiting the Norwegian army from recruiting new soldiers in the United States, not allowing Norwegian ships to assemble components in American ports, and not allowing Americans to travel on Norwegian ships. It is reported that Norwegian Ambassador to the United States Morgenstierne requested the US government to postpone the recognition of Norway as a belligerent, and it was also heard that the Ambassador had advised the Norwegian government to postpone the formal declaration of war with Germany. Therefore, the above proclamation could not help but sadden Morgenstierne. According to official sources here, the US government also hoped not to recognize Norway as a belligerent, just as it had ignored the Soviet-Finnish and Sino-Japanese wars. However, the powers now competing in Norway are all belligerent nations that the United States has already recognized and declared, so the situation is different from before. The US government cannot but recognize Norway as a belligerent. (International News Service dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<p>London: Soviet sources here stated that the Soviet government firmly opposes the German occupation of the Åland Islands (belonging to Finland). Their motivation is not sympathy for the Allied Powers, but because they do not want Germany to easily obtain Swedish iron ore. The Åland Islands are in the Baltic Sea, at the mouth of the Gulf of Bothnia, located between Finland and Sweden, that is, in the "Soviet sphere of influence in the Baltic Sea" as defined by the Soviet Union. If Germany occupies them, it will not only gain economic benefits, but also gain an important strategic stronghold, especially in the summer when the Gulf of Bothnia thaws. The Soviet Union is certainly not willing to accept this. However, Finland has built strong fortifications on the Åland Islands and laid mines along the coast. Germany will encounter difficulties if it attacks, and Finland's resistance will inevitably become stronger due to the Soviet Union's attitude. However, if Germany believes that it must occupy the Åland Islands in order to consolidate its position in the Scandinavian Peninsula, it is feared that it will still act recklessly regardless of the consequences. This is a matter of great concern.</p>

<p>Washington: Massachusetts Democratic Senator Walsh, Chairman of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, made a broadcast last night, advocating that the United States should increase its navy to be equal to that of other countries. However, Walsh also stated that he strongly opposes the United States participating in the European War and also opposes getting involved in war over the Far East issue. He does not believe that the United States will intervene in and resolve the Dutch East Indies issue. Walsh also stated that US naval experts believe that the only way for the United States to achieve victory in the Far East is to cooperate with the British and French navies, but any military alliance is contrary to American traditionalism.

<p>Washington: The US Navy Department yesterday called for bids to manufacture submarine defense nets to meet the needs of Pearl Harbor, the Panama Canal, the Golden Gate, and Guantanamo. This defense net will be manufactured at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard in California, with a total cost of approximately $22 million. Naval officials predict that the Navy's huge shipbuilding program, including eight battleships, will be completed four months ahead of schedule. The new American aircraft carrier "Wasp," weighing 14,700 tons, was officially commissioned into the fleet in Boston yesterday. The ship began construction in 1936 and can carry 75 aircraft and is equipped with 40 anti-aircraft guns. In addition to aircraft pilots and mechanics, it can accommodate 1,000 officers and soldiers. The ship cost $20,737,000. (United Press dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<p>Tokyo: The arrival of U.S. Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, in Tokyo has been postponed to the 29th of this month. Initially, it was expected that Sayre would arrive today, so U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Grew, had prepared a banquet to welcome Sayre tonight. When Japanese officials met with journalists this morning, they were asked if Sayre would meet with Japanese officials. The Foreign Ministry spokesperson replied that there was no definite plan for a meeting, but it was expected that Sayre would meet with Foreign Minister Arita. He was asked whether Sayre and Arita would discuss the Philippine Islands immigration bill, as its passage into law would reduce the number of Japanese immigrants to the Philippine Islands to 500 per year. The spokesperson said he had no knowledge of this. The U.S. Ambassador had suggested introducing Sayre to the Emperor, but due to the postponement of Sayre's arrival, no definite arrangements had been made. Sayre will stay in Tokyo for about ten days and return home by ship from Kobe on May 8th. It is reported that Grew will leave for home for vacation after meeting with Sayre. According to reports, when Sayre arrived in Shanghai on the flagship USS Augusta of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet on the 22nd of this month, he told reporters that he intended to meet with the U.S. Ambassador in Tokyo to maintain close contact with international developments. He said that this trip would promote closer cooperation among U.S. diplomats overseas. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to the "Nichinichi Shimbun," the Philippine immigration restriction bill is another manifestation of the U.S. anti-Japanese policy. The U.S. State Department and the Labor Department have followed the recommendations of former U.S. Commissioner to the Philippine Islands, McCutcheon, and sent representatives to participate in the drafting of the bill. Therefore, there is a mastermind behind the bill. It ostensibly claims to restrict the entry of Jewish and Spanish refugees to reduce unemployment among Filipinos, but in reality, it is aimed at Japan. The newspaper then listed the achievements of the Japanese in developing the Philippine Islands, saying that the Philippine authorities are now repaying kindness with enmity by reducing the number of Japanese immigrants to 500 per year, the same quota as the United Kingdom and France, which have never sent immigrants to the Philippines, which is a distinctly unfriendly act.

<p>TASS Special Dispatch: During the Five-Year Plans (1928 to 1937), the total residential area newly built in Soviet cities and workers' districts reached 50,200,000 square meters. The construction costs were borne by various economic organizations and local Soviets. 354 new cities have been established beyond the Arctic Circle, in the Far East, Siberia, and Central Asia. In the Ural region alone, 37 new cities have been established in recent years. The small wooden houses of the past have now been replaced by tall buildings, and backward towns have been transformed into modern cities. The development of Stalingrad, in particular, has been rapid. During the Five-Year Plans, the city's residential area has tripled. In addition, the construction of residential buildings in various republics and workers' districts has also developed rapidly. The area of new housing built in Ukraine is 10 million square meters, and the residential area in Belarus has also increased by 50%. Housing construction in Moscow is particularly active, with simultaneous development inside and outside the city. Currently, the construction outside the city is no less than that inside the city. In the Third Five-Year Plan, the area of new housing in the Soviet Union will reach 35 million square meters. In 1940, 380 million rubles have already been spent. In Tsarist Russia, the rent paid by laborers accounted for 20% of their wages. Currently, the rent they pay only accounts for 4% of their wages.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Traveling Freely in China, Dr. Monroe Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday, Says China Will Surely Win, Deeply Impressed by Traveling Around, Will Urge the U.S. to Continue to Lend Large Sums <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Monroe of the United States arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 4:30 pm on the President Pierce. Dr. Monroe traveled to "Free China" in the middle of last month. He said that he had a very good impression and guaranteed that China would defeat Japan in this war of resistance and achieve the goal of "winning the war of resistance and building the country." Dr. Monroe is an old man with gray hair, but he is energetic and his words fully express his optimism about China's future. The following is a record of his speech:</p>
<p>Very Impressed by Traveling Around</p>
<p>Dr. Monroe said that he had previously visited the United States and done his best in Washington to urge the U.S. government to continue to provide credit loans to China. After traveling around "Free China" this time, he was very impressed and believed that China would definitely defeat Japan and achieve the ultimate goal of the war of resistance. As for Chairman Chiang and the senior officials of the Chinese government, they firmly believe that this war of resistance will use a strategy of attrition to cause Japan to suffer a disastrous defeat in a long-term war. At present, the Chinese government and the people have a unified belief that the war of resistance will be won. All farmers, workers, and soldiers have ten times more trust in the Chinese government than in the past, and they are united and act as a backing for the government because of the arousal of patriotism.</p>
<p>Self-Sufficient and Not Lacking</p>
<p>Dr. Monroe continued, "When I traveled in 'Free China,' I obtained ironclad proof that China can be self-sufficient. Factories have been set up everywhere, and the quantity of products has increased greatly. It is especially worth noting that China is now able to manufacture its own military supplies, which proves that the Chinese people are able to do their best to resist Japanese aggression." A certain Mr. met an old man who pointed to his five-year-old child and said, "Ten years later, he can serve the country." Mr. also met a Chinese peasant woman who said, "China has now completely woken up." All of these are enough to prove that China's future is infinitely bright.</p>
<p>Construction and War of Resistance at the Same Time</p>
<p>Dr. Monroe believes that the most impressive thing is that there are so many intellectual youths and students in the interior who are serving the country. He said, "Looking back on the past, people all believed that most of the Chinese students who returned to China were useless because the technical knowledge they learned was not suitable for Chinese society. Now it is different. Returned students and technical talents are urgently needed by the government. Since the outbreak of the war, China has been building and resisting at the same time, and the importance of technical talents has been recognized by society." Another factor that China can defeat Japan is its vast human resources. He said, "In Sichuan, there are crowds of people everywhere, which is very harmonious. When I passed through Japan, there was no such situation."</p>
<p>Attrition Warfare Consumes the Japanese Army</p>
<p>Dr. Monroe also said, "Although I did not personally see the scene of the battlefield during this trip, the Japanese strategy is almost entirely based on old methods, that is, to make a linear advance in the territory of 'Free China.' The areas occupied by the Japanese army are often constantly bombed by the Chinese air force and suffer heavy blows. The Chinese army hopes that the Japanese army will not abandon the land it has occupied and engage in attrition warfare, because only in this way can the enemy be consumed."</p>
<p>All Countries Should Intensify Aid to China</p>
<p>Finally, Dr. said, "I believe that Western countries should quickly intensify aid to China and lend large sums of money to China. This action is by no means an unfriendly act to Japan. The unfriendly act to Japan is the embargo on Japan." Dr. Monroe said that when he returns to the United States this time, he will do his best to urge the Americans to aid China and lend China large sums of money so that China can continue to resist the war and win the final victory.</p>

<p>The French Ambassador to China, Cosme, left Shanghai on the Zhi Ba De of the Java Mail Line on November 10th of last year to pay respects to the central authorities and handle official affairs, taking the route of Hanoi and the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to Chongqing. He stayed in Chongqing for a very long time. Now that the official affairs are relatively relaxed, he flew from Chongqing to Hong Kong by plane last week. As for private affairs in Shanghai, they are still awaiting contact. The ambassador has taken the "Peleks Leshaner" of the French Mail Line to Shanghai. A reporter from the New Voice Agency learned from the French Mail Line last night that the ship is scheduled to arrive here at 10:00 am tomorrow and dock at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou.</p>
<h3 id="e64">British Government Controls British Merchant Ships in China, Subject to Adjustment at Any Time, Still Maintain Original Routes, Jardine Matheson Has Received Accurate News <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>China's shipping industry has been completely suspended since the invasion two years ago. The largest shipping agency is the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The company has already moved its office to Chongqing, and the Jiangchuan Line on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, namely the Yichang-Chongqing Line, is still operating as usual. As for the recent rumors that the company is planning to develop shipping routes in Southeast Asia, it may be too early to say. The Yangtze River and coastal ports have been monopolized by Japanese ships. Therefore, foreign ships on the Yangtze River Line have also suspended sailing along with Chinese ships for nearly three years. Although the coastal routes are often obstructed by unexpected events, the business is still prosperous. Since China's war of resistance, foreign ships have made a lot of profit. However, after the outbreak of the European War, all German ships sailing in the Far East have been suspended. Recently, as Denmark and Norway have been drawn into the vortex, Danish and Norwegian ships have also been suspended. Norwegian ships have now resumed sailing, but there is no news of Danish ships.</p>
<p>Requisition News</p>
<p>According to yesterday's report, the British company Jardine Matheson has received news that the British authorities may requisition all of its sea ships, except for those on the Yangtze River, through its China Navigation Company. It is learned that the company owns 18 sea ships, and it newly purchased 4 sea ships in Hong Kong last year, bringing the total to 22 sea ships. There are 13 small ships on the Yangtze River and upper reaches of the Yangtze River. After seeing the Hong Kong telegram, the company was inquired about it. According to the company in Shanghai, it has indeed received the above news. However, the Westerners strictly keep the telegram secret. It is also said that if they are requisitioned in the future, it is estimated that not all of them will be requisitioned, and some will definitely be left to maintain the shipping routes. Recently, foreign shipping businesses have also been affected by the European War and are in a precarious situation. It can be said to be a troubled time.</p>
<p>Newly Revised Regulations</p>
<p>It was also reported yesterday that the British naval authorities had learned that the British government has formulated new regulations to continue to requisition British merchant ships sailing to various ports along the Chinese coast, which will be implemented from the first day of next month. Under these regulations, the companies most affected will be Jardine Matheson and Taikoo. Other British merchant shipping companies will also be affected to a considerable extent. According to sources in the shipping industry, the situation after the implementation of the new regulations will not be as serious as generally expected, as British merchant ships will not be completely suspended. It is said that all ships will not be completely transferred to Europe and will not be transferred out of the Far East. The new regulations will include two points: one is that British ships will be completely requisitioned by the government and transferred to Europe or other areas to serve; the other is that they will be controlled by the British government, and the ships will continue to sail on their original routes.</p>
<p>No Drastic Changes</p>
<p>The possibility of stipulating the latter method is even greater, that is, all ships will be controlled by the government, but the shipping companies will still retain a share of the management power. Therefore, it is expected that from the first day of next month, there will be no drastic changes in British Far East shipping. According to reports, the passenger and cargo transportation of British ships will continue, but the sailing schedule of the ships will depend on the changes in the political and military situation in the Far East and Europe. At present, the British merchant ships that will be affected are estimated to be about 60. All ships of Jardine Matheson and Taikoo will be completely restricted.</p>
<p>Norwegian Shipping Routes</p>
<p>After the Norwegian merchant ships sailing in the Far East were allowed to resume sailing, the ships that had been ordered to sail to Hong Kong were all preparing to come to Shanghai and resume sailing. However, it is learned that the Norwegian ships sailing in the Far East will not all sail according to the old routes in the future. The shipping route will mainly be the Hong Kong-Shanghai line, and the rest will be Saigon and various ports in South China, North China, and Central China. It is also learned that the Norwegian ship Rani has now returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong and will sail on the Shanghai-Tianjin line soon. There is also a ship named New Anmao Mimer, and the telegram has reported that it left Hong Kong yesterday and will arrive in Shanghai at the end of the month.</p>
<p>Ship Officers Demand</p>
<p>Foreign ship officers of British companies Taikoo and Jardine Matheson have demanded a raise in salary and a guarantee that each ship will hire a third officer. The company is currently considering these demands and has not yet responded. It has been found that although some ships sailing along the coast have hired Chinese third officers, the rest only hire a chief officer and a second officer. Therefore, they are resentful and claim that the time spent on watch is too long, and a few ship officers have to watch for as long as twelve hours, which is contrary to the work regulations. The Chinese Ship Officers Union of various ports and the Chinese Engineers Union held a joint meeting in Hong Kong last week to discuss this issue, but no action was taken. At present, no action will be taken until the company has responded to the demands. It is said that all ship officers believe that a living allowance is necessary, so they ask the company to increase their salaries appropriately. Ship officers who have to support their families are particularly eager for a raise.</p>

<p>In the middle section of the Shanghai-Nanking Railway, between Wuxi and Zhenjiang, the Chinese army is very active and often attacks the Japanese army. The tracks in Zhenjiang and Danyang are also often destroyed by the Chinese army. Therefore, the Shanghai-Nanking morning train the day before yesterday (the 25th), which was originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai at 7:00 am to Nanking, was delayed because the tracks were disrupted and not repaired. It did not depart from Shanghai until 11:00 am.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Public Works Bureau Reduction Plan to be Studied by the Economic Committee; Committee Members to be Fully Announced Next Week; the Bureau Recently Dismissed a Batch of Western Employees <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Following the resolution of the Western taxpayers' annual meeting on the 17th of this month to expand the organization of the Public Works Bureau's Economic Committee, to internationalize it, and to increase the number of committee members from four to twelve, in addition to the original four from China, Britain, America, and Japan, one more member each will be added from these four countries, and one member each will be added from France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. The committee's task is to study government reductions. The list of committee members is expected to be fully released next week. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Responsible for Studying Reduction Plans</p>
<p>According to a certain Chinese director, the establishment of the Public Works Bureau's Economic Committee is responsible for studying methods of government reductions for the Public Works Bureau, to ensure that government reductions do not affect its administrative efficiency in the future. In detail, it will study (1) how to make municipal management more rational, (2) how the Public Works Bureau can implement government reductions without hindering its administrative efficiency, (3) employing Westerners and Chinese residing in Shanghai to replace Westerners from Europe, and (4) reviewing relevant documents and conducting detailed reviews and discussions on the overall situation, and then produce a report for the Public Works Bureau Board of Directors to refer to. After implementation, the committee's task will be completed.</p>
<p>Economic Committee Previously Established</p>
<p>Five or six years ago, the Public Works Bureau established a similar temporary committee. At that time, the chairman was former Chairman Fessenden. The result of the study on government reductions at that time was to reduce expenditures by more than one million yuan. However, after August 13th, the currency value fell, and Western employees were paid huge foreign exchange subsidies. Last year, grain prices soared, and Chinese employees were paid rice subsidies. The one million yuan previously reduced was offset by this, and it was not even enough. Therefore, the Bureau decided to increase donations in the next year and accepted suggestions from all parties to establish an Economic Committee and expand its organization to further study reasonable government reduction methods.</p>
<p>Current Organization is Temporary</p>
<p>As for the statement that this organization is an expansion of the Finance Committee, this is a misunderstanding. The Public Works Bureau Board of Directors has several standing subcommittees. When the Board of Directors encounters cases that need to be reviewed, it assigns them to a specific subcommittee based on their nature. The Finance Committee is one such standing subcommittee. In addition, temporary subcommittees may be established when necessary for temporary events until their task is completed and they are dissolved. The Rickshaw Pullers Committee is one example. The nature of the Economic Committee is different from that of standing committees.</p>
<p>Committee Members to be Announced Next Week</p>
<p>The list of committee members from each country, except for the two Chinese members, who have already been recommended by the Chinese Ratepayers Association to be Yu Qiaqing and Xi Yushu, is currently being selected by the expatriates of each country. According to sources close to the Concession authorities, the full list of committee members is expected to be released next week, and it is believed that British Director Powell and Japanese Director Kazuo Okamoto will both be included in the selection.</p>
<p>Bureau Dismissed Several More Western Employees</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau's public announcement yesterday included the list of dismissed employees. According to investigations, in addition to the previously known dismissed personnel, there is one more person on the list. That person is Pando, a highway engineer who has served in the Public Works Bureau for twenty-seven years. He has now received a retirement notice and must leave within two months. It is also learned that the staff of various departments of the Public Works Bureau are currently not very clear about the issue of layoffs, as the terms "layoff" and "retirement" have been confused. They are extremely worried about whether they will suffer the same fate in the near future. The vacancies of the dismissed employees were previously rumored to be filled by Jewish refugees, but the Public Works Bureau officially denied this. However, yesterday, reliable sources revealed that after the dismissal of automobile engineer Walter Fels, four Jewish refugees have filled his position. It is also reported that the Public Works Department has a total of nine people who were dismissed. Another is the Director of the Intelligence Department, Foulonshan. They all received retirement notices around March 29th and left their positions within twenty-four hours. As for their names, in addition to Pando, there are also Bairington, Fang Boluo, Hopkin, Nai Tuo, Jie Xun, Ke Er, Si Wei Qifu Kan, Tom Shi, and Walter Fels. The announcement also stated that some police officers will also retire.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Japan's Competition in Trade with China Has Encountered Major Difficulties; Shanghai Japanese Merchants Want to Compete with Third Countries and Demand Exclusion from the Yen Bloc <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Lowering the Value of the Yen is Feared to be Disallowed by the Japanese Military</p>
<p>Recently, Japanese merchants in Shanghai have repeatedly gathered to discuss the issue of commercial competition between Japan and third countries after the opening of the Yangtze River. They have now requested the government to exclude Central China, especially the Shanghai area, from the Yen Bloc to compete with third countries as much as possible. It is reported that Japan's trade with China is currently facing major difficulties.</p>
<p>Yen Overabundance</p>
<p>The reason for this is the overabundance of Japanese currency in China. If the Japanese side wants to maintain the status of its currency in China, it must at least back it with materials, allowing Japanese merchants in China to remit yen back to the country to purchase goods. However, if this is done, the result of the influx of Japanese goods into China will inevitably accelerate the rise of domestic prices in Japan and increase the value of the yen in China. This method is naturally not adopted by the Japanese government, which would rather transport these goods to third countries to obtain foreign exchange. However, if trade with China is completely excluded from the Yen Bloc,</p>
<p>Gathering Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>According to what the Japanese merchants have requested, Japan can easily obtain foreign exchange, but if the medium of exchange is legal tender, the yen will lose its backing and will inevitably plummet, which will not be allowed by the Japanese military in China. This time, the Japanese merchants' request is ambiguous about whether to use yen or legal tender in the future, only seeking to lift restrictions and remove the constraints on Japanese goods entering China, to compete with third countries, especially the United States, because the United States' trade with Shanghai is currently three times that of Japan. However, the difficulty for the Japanese government to devise a good plan is within the realm of imagination. Therefore, it is also hesitant about the opening of the Yangtze River. How the Japanese government decides on the Japanese merchants' request is closely related to the price of Japanese yarn in China. The recent decline of the yen is said to have been affected by this shock.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Public Works Bureau to Form a Special Committee to Resolve the Livelihood of Dispersed Refugees; Fear of Further Drifting or Even Returning to Shanghai as Vagrants; the Beggar Problem is Becoming Increasingly Serious and Deserves Attention <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The Da Zhong News Agency reports that there are a total of twenty-four refugee camps in this city. According to Morris, the leader of the Salvation Army, the refugees in the camps will be completely resettled. It is now learned that in the past few weeks, about 30,000 refugees, an average of 400 per day, have been resettled. The Public Works Bureau will organize a special committee to handle this matter. Currently, this work is being undertaken by the Refugee Relief Association and the Salvation Army. Each resettled refugee is given a considerable subsidy, 15 yuan for adults and 10 yuan for those under 16 years old, to enable them to return to their hometowns or engage in other livelihoods. The difficulty is that these refugees receive some resettlement subsidies but do not immediately leave Shanghai to return to their hometowns, and instead drift around Shanghai, eventually becoming beggars. This will still increase the burden on society. The Public Works Bureau, in view of this, plans to organize a special committee to investigate whether the resettled refugees have indeed left Shanghai, or have found employment in Shanghai, to avoid the risk of drifting away.</p>
<p>After Resettlement</p>
<p>Morris and Yuan Ludeng both believe that the future of resettled refugees is not optimistic, because countless refugees will inevitably exhaust their subsidies, return to the streets, and become beggars. Morris further pointed out that some refugees will have difficulties immediately after resettlement, namely, that they will not be able to have a residence in this densely populated city. Regarding this point, it is said that the Public Works Bureau will find a solution, and the special committee organized by the Public Works Bureau will make the greatest effort to solve the resettlement problem and the various problems caused by resettlement. According to Morris, the Dunxin Road refugee camp will be retained after all the refugees have been resettled, and will be used to accommodate the elderly, weak, and disabled. Refugees who cannot be completely resettled in the near future will be temporarily accommodated in the Yanping Road refugee camp, and then another solution will be found. At present, the most concrete thing that the special committee can decide is to purchase boat or train tickets for the refugees to enable them to return to their hometowns. Currently, refugees who are resettled have not received assistance from the Public Works Bureau, so many of them stay in the suburbs of Shanghai and have not returned to their hometowns.</p>
<p>Becoming Beggars</p>
<p>According to Nash, Deputy Director of the Public Works Bureau, the difficult problem in resettling refugees in Shanghai is that there are not a few refugees who have drifted to Shanghai from the suburbs. After resettlement, they can certainly return to their hometowns in the short term, but if they have nothing to live on in their hometowns, they will inevitably become drifters again, and the seriousness of the beggar problem in Shanghai will be formed. Therefore, the urgent task is the beggar problem. There is currently no accurate statistic on the total number of beggars in Shanghai, but according to general estimates, the number should be above the number of refugees. This is proved by the number of beggars found on the streets by the police and the number of beggar corpses received by charitable organizations.</p>
<p>Insufficient Funding</p>
<p>In addition to the resettled refugees, there are still 5,000 to 10,000 elderly, weak, and disabled people left in Shanghai who need to be provided for. This estimate was confirmed yesterday by Morris, the leader of the Salvation Army. According to Yuan Ludeng's announcement yesterday, the current disaster relief fund requires about 300,000 yuan per month, but the current donations from all parties are only 200,000 yuan. The rising cost of living has made this problem increasingly serious. Two years ago, each refugee only needed 2 yuan per month for supplies, but now it has increased to more than 6 yuan. Last year, the total income of the disaster relief fund was 4,500,000 yuan, while the expenditure was only 4,000,000 yuan. This year, the situation is much worse.</p>
<h3 id="e72">After the Implementation of the Public Treasury Law, Refund Methods are Revised <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs recently stated that because the Public Treasury Law has been implemented, the bureau's past three refund methods are no longer applicable. It has specially revised the refund methods into four articles. When applying for a refund, the applicant or agent must apply for verification according to the new method, one of which is selected. The new methods are recorded as follows: (1) When a trademark applicant or agent applies to transfer the refundable fees from case A to case B, the original receipt shall still be submitted to the bureau for cancellation and re-issuance, or re-issuance with additional notes, in accordance with the previous method. (2) If the applicant or agent is in Chongqing, when applying for a refund, the original receipt issued by the bureau shall be attached, and the bureau shall fill in the "Income Refund Form" and attach it to the reply. After receiving the aforementioned "Income Refund Form", the applicant shall affix the same seal as on the original application form in the "Signature and Seal of Refund Recipient" column, and take it to the National Treasury Main Treasury to exchange it for cash. (3) If the applicant or agent is in another location and entrusts a familiar business or relative in Chongqing to collect the refund on their behalf, they shall state this in the application for a refund and attach the original receipt issued by the bureau. The bureau shall fill in the "Income Refund Form" and attach it to the reply. After the applicant signs and affixes the same seal as on the original application form, it shall be sent to the familiar business or relative in Chongqing, who shall take it to the National Treasury Main Treasury to collect the refund on their behalf. (4) If the applicant or agent is in another location and it is inconvenient to entrust someone in Chongqing to collect the refund on their behalf, they shall also state this in the application and attach the original receipt, which will be filled in by the bureau "Income Refund Form" and sent directly to the National Treasury for remittance.</p>

The Gospel Radio Station may follow the example of the China-America Radio Station and file a protest with the Japanese Consulate General in this city. The British Chinese Western Daily borrows the Gospel Radio Station to broadcast news several times a day. Since it was disturbed yesterday, it is not yet known whether it will appeal to the British authorities for negotiations.</p>

<p>Huiyuan Bank at 4 and 5 Ningbo Road previously transferred a large sum of money to its Lianhao Xiangfeng Bank in Wuxi. Xiangfeng ordered its staff to escort 160,000 yuan in legal tender to Shanghai on the 9th of this month. When it arrived in Shanghai at 12:30 noon, just as it was about to deliver the money to Huiyuan, while walking next to the Qiujiang Road railway, several robbers suddenly came forward and robbed all 160,000 yuan. After this case occurred, Huiyuan reported to the police and requested an investigation. At the same time, a reward was offered in the newspaper in the hope of solving the case. Since the occurrence of this case, Chinese and foreign detectives in various police stations in the Public Concession have done their best to investigate. Until recently, Chinese Chief Detective You A'gen, Detective Li Pengfei, Detective Sun Dafa, Qin Lianggdeng, and others from the Lao Zha Police Station arrested Sun A'bao, a robber from Zhenhai, Zhejiang, on Aiduo Ya Road. Later, Wei Xiaode, an accomplice, was arrested on the Bund of Jiujiang Road. It was revealed that a large amount of stolen money was hidden at the home of Xu Wenhua, an accomplice, in a bungalow on Huishan Road. The detectives went to arrest Xu but found him missing, only arresting Xu Gu Shi, Xu Zhang Shi, and Zhang Li Shi, three women, and recovering part of the stolen goods, 4,000 yuan (which have been deposited in various banks with passbooks). They were taken to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide opened the court to continue the interrogation. The police lawyer Ru Bao Yi requested a postponement of the hearing because it was still necessary to investigate the accomplices. After questioning by Judge Feng, he ordered them to be detained pending further investigation.</p>

<p>Huang Qiwen, a silk merchant from Wuxi residing at No. 10, Ximoli, 249 Seymour Road, was suddenly kidnapped by several bandits at 6:45 a.m. on January 11 of this year. Later, Huang managed to escape. Yesterday, Chinese Chief Detective You A'gen, Detectives Yang Guanying, He Xiaozhi, and others from the Lao Zha Police Station arrested Wang Xiangxian, Fang Dexi, Liu Guoen, and three other kidnappers from Yong on the rooftop garden of the Sincere Department Store. According to their confession, they and a certain number of Taiwanese and other Chinese from a certain platform within the so-called Changying Force under a certain organization took a car to Huang's house to kidnap him. After the kidnapping, they hid him in the unit on Tiantong Road. They were sent to the Criminal Division 1 of the First Special Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer Ru Bao Yi requested permission for temporary detention because the case still needed to be thoroughly investigated and the accomplices at large needed to be apprehended. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, he ordered the case to be postponed for further interrogation, and the defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<p>Li Yongkuan, Li Jia Zhou, Li Bi Hua, a notorious bandit from Anhui, and his sons were all sentenced to heavy sentences by the Second Special Court. Li and others refused to accept the judgment and filed a third-instance appeal. The court ordered the case to be returned to the Higher Third Branch Court for a retrial. During the court investigation, Li Yao Shi, Li Fei's wife, went to the countryside to entice Yang Cai Shi, an elderly woman from the countryside, and coerced She Zhuping, the father of the victim She Yuexian, to come to Shanghai and surrender to be used as false witnesses. After the adjournment, She Yuexian grabbed Li Yao Shi and Yang Cai Shi and dragged them into the French Police Station, where they were transferred to the Second Special Court and charged with perjury and obstructing freedom. After investigating the case, the court's presiding judge Liao transferred the case to Judge Sun Pengxian for a new trial. The case has been suspended until now because the witness She Zhuping was ill and unable to attend. Yesterday, the continued hearing was held again. According to the defendants, they all denied having instigated perjury. Subsequently, the witness She Zhuping arrived and stated that he had been coerced to come to Shanghai by Li Yao Shi and others, and the process of his daughter being kidnapped and forced into marriage at that time. Since the case was clear, the court ordered a debate to be held and announced that the verdict would be delivered on May 3. The defendants were still released on bail.</p>

<p>After the expansion of the war in Europe, the situation in the Dutch East Indies gradually became tense. The islands of the Dutch South Seas are known for their prosperous commerce, and many overseas Chinese reside there. According to overseas Chinese returning from the South Seas, the Dutch South Seas Islands have recently been affected by the war, and the Dutch government is actively carrying out various defense projects, causing the commerce operated by overseas Chinese in the area to suffer. A large number of overseas Chinese in Java are preparing to return to China and are expected to arrive in Shanghai in early next month. Most of these overseas Chinese are from Fujian, and after returning to China, they will return to their original hometowns. It is learned that, in view of the increasing number of overseas Chinese traveling between Shanghai and the South Seas, the Java Mail Ship Company has organized the Fujian Overseas Chinese Information Office to handle the reception of overseas Chinese going abroad and returning to China for the convenience of serving them.</p>

<p>It was previously reported in this city that three Japanese were kidnapped while sailing outside the Wusong Estuary. The Japanese side has now dispatched detectives everywhere, but as of press time, there has been no news of the missing Japanese returning. The incident occurred when Ishizaki Tokuhisa (26 years old), his wife Kimie (21 years old), and another employee, Tomioka Aki (29 years old), employees of the Jiangnan Industrial Company Si Jiao Island Branch, a Japanese company at 167 Tiantong Road in this city, sailed to Shanghai on the company's 80th Sanhe Xiao Wheel on the night of the 24th. At around 11 a.m. on the 25th, when they arrived at a certain place about four miles from the Wusong Estuary, two small boats carrying armed men surrounded the wheel from the left and right, shouting for it to stop. At that time, Ishizaki fired a pistol wildly, but was still no match. At that time, all three were kidnapped and their whereabouts are unknown. After the Japanese side received the news, it was reported that it had sent warships to search, but the sea was silent and nothing was found. According to the Japanese side's announcement yesterday, it is believed that this was done by pirates.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Opium for Stomach Pain <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Chinese people lack common sense, and when they see relatives and friends suffering from severe stomach pain, they earnestly persuade them to smoke a few puffs of opium to relieve the pain, saying it with great conviction, as if opium can indeed cure stomach pain, and only opium can save them. In fact, how can opium cure stomach pain? It is merely using its anesthetic power to cover up the stomach pain, like using a smoke bomb to hide it, or using a blanket to cover it up. Not only is the root cause of the stomach pain not removed, but they also become addicted to opium, causing lifelong harm. The addiction grows bigger and bigger, and when the stomach pain flares up, one pipe is enough at first, but later it slowly becomes two or three pipes. At that time, they are busy getting high all day long, and there is no time to think about the deep-seated stomach disease that is getting worse every day. One day, it will become unmanageable. If you think about it, those who want to quit smoking, after quitting for a short time, the stomach disease reappears, and in the end, they cannot bear the pain and can never quit. This is also a serious problem in the process of quitting smoking.</p>
<p>According to hospital surveys, people with stomach diseases can only take "Five Minutes" stomach pain relief powder. Not only does it relieve pain quickly, but it also removes the root cause of the disease and never recurs. At that time, quitting smoking will also be unspeakably safe and pleasant.</p>
<p>Five Minutes</p>
<p>Stomach Pain Relief Powder has precious ingredients that have been tested and proven to contain no anesthetics or other toxic substances, so even children can take it. It has been popular in the South Seas for 20 years, and now its reputation is well-known far and wide. The price is popular and helps the world. Each box of 12 bags is 2 yuan, and each bag is 2 jiao.

As he disembarked from the Roosevelt Wharf and walked along Taiwan Road, he encountered detectives from the French Police Station searching pedestrians. Detective Xu Guizhu noticed him walking unsteadily and discovered two large packages of opium, weighing twenty taels, strapped to his legs. He was immediately taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. The police requested an extension of the investigation, which was granted by Judge Miao Qingbang after an initial inquiry. The hearing was adjourned to the 30th, and the defendant was detained.</p>

<p>Gu Wenqing (father's name Rui Ru, 53 years old) from Yangsi Bridge in Pudong, brings vegetables from the countryside to Shanghai every morning to sell for a living. Yesterday morning at 10:30 AM, Gu brought his basket to the vegetable market in the French Concession's Eight Immortals Bridge area to sell his produce. At that time, a Western police officer, number 71, from the French Police Station, arrived to check permits. Fearing punishment for not having a permit, Gu fled with his basket into the first lane of Hengmao Lane. The officer chased after him, and Gu, in a moment of panic and due to his advanced age, stumbled and fell at the back entrance of number 40. By the time the officer caught up, Gu had already stopped breathing and died.</p>

In the women's championship final between the Chinese and Jewish teams, the Chinese team lived up to expectations and won by a score of 4-1, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. In the men's final, the Chinese athletes were in high spirits. The entire team wore white tennis short-sleeved shirts with the national flag embroidered on their chests, and they were led by team leader Chen Linsheng. Due to the absence of Ouyang Wei, Huang Zhijun, a reserve player, participated for China. The Chinese team won the first four games in a row. In the fifth game, Qiao Linhuike displayed excellent chopping and defensive skills, providing strong resistance to Li Zongpei. Qiao eventually won 22-20, earning the most valuable point for the Jewish team. In the end, the Chinese team crushed the Jewish team 13-1 to win the championship. After the match, according to Chinese team leader Chen Linsheng, Siff, the world runner-up in table tennis singles, and the three most famous players in the United States, Wagner and McCoy, will come to Shanghai in early June to challenge.

<h3 id="e104">Grain: Attempting to Manipulate the Market Continues, Imported Rice Immediately Imported After Price Drop; Glutinous Rice Difficult to Sell Due to Hot Weather, Seeking to Dispose of Stocks <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>After the Rice Market Bureau returned to Kunshan again, yesterday, both buyers and sellers continued to strengthen their efforts. As a result, the prices of various types of imported rice rose again. The situation of Yingtong Lai imported rice is different from the past. It does not rely solely on actual sales and seems to be engaged in short-selling and buying, like a stock exchange. Although the market has announced that such practices are prohibited, it is nothing more than covering up for foreigners and deceiving the world. Those engaged in speculation continue to use people's food as a "rubber ball," which is hateful to say. Currently, when the price is high, there are many short sellers. In the past two days, they still believed that the decline had not stopped and were full of hope. However, the market tightened again overnight, and they could not resist, so they hurriedly sought to cover their positions. Therefore, before the market opened in the morning, inquiries were made and efforts were made to occupy a favorable position. The market was quickly bought up, and the shouts rose one after another. In the meantime, some customers from inland villages and stores also participated, making the market even more lively. In a short time, the prices of various goods increased by about one and a half yuan. At this time, the price was already high, and the desire to cover positions gradually weakened. Other sales venues followed suit, and the overall trend began to weaken slightly. It was almost noon, and the price had fallen by nearly one yuan. However, the market is changeable and difficult to grasp. After falling once, short covering resumed, and the situation became tense again. By the close of the market, it had not weakened slightly. As a result, the closing price was one and a half yuan higher than the previous day's closing price.</p>
<p>In other news, after several days of decline in the price of imported rice, yesterday it attracted the interest of the rice merchants. The Shantou, Xiamen, and Tianjin merchants were preparing to load five to six thousand bags of rice. It is rumored that the Taiwanese merchants are shipping five thousand bags, but the goods are actually being shipped by Japanese merchants. However, the market and people's minds have been stirred up, and the prices of various types of rice have risen sharply, especially the price of small-grained rice, which has been actively traded and has risen the most. The price of 40.9 yuan yesterday rose to 42.5 yuan yesterday, but in the afternoon, some profits were taken out, and it was also affected by the new deal for Saigon No. 2, and the closing price was only 42.1 yuan. The prices of other Saigon and Siamese rice all rose by more than one yuan in the morning and fell by four or five cents in the afternoon. The prices of Saigon No. 2 for April and May have been rising all the way, opening at 53 yuan and rising to 53.5 yuan. 500 tons of New Saigon No. 2 have been sold, and it is rumored that 2,500 tons have been sold at prices of 53 yuan and 51.9 yuan. More than 300 tons have been covered. There are currently more than 10,000 bags of imported rice.</p>
<p>More imported rice has arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Qiongzhou vessel arrived from Hong Kong with 8,435 bags of rice and docked at the French Concession Bund wharf. Unloading will begin this morning. It is reported that the Italian (transliteration) vessel "Huáěrbǐ" (transliteration) is arriving in Shanghai today directly from Saigon with 97 tons of rice. In addition, the French postal ship "Fó lì shì Luó zǐ" (transliteration) is also scheduled to arrive today, and it is said that it also has imported rice on board. The amount will be known after the ship arrives.</p>
<p>Due to the continuous arrival of glutinous rice, yesterday there were also 2,300 to 400 bags of goods from the Changxi Sujia area arriving, and the weather is hot and humid, and mold will arrive soon, so it is not easy to keep it for a long time. They all seek to dispose of it quickly, so it is still flat and can only keep pace with imported rice. In the market, Changzhou Suxu sticky rice is being sold at 39.8 yuan, and Nangang Huzao at 40 yuan to 39.5 yuan. Outside the market, it is rumored that Changxi high-quality glutinous rice is at 44 to 45 yuan, Zhongguan at 43 yuan, Kunsu glutinous rice at 43.5 to 42.5 yuan, Qingpu and Sijing (falsely called) at 43.5 to 42.5 yuan, and Nangang original package early and late rice at 42.5 to 41.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, glutinous rice was being sold at 39.5 yuan for Liyang special rice, and 38.5 to 38 yuan for Danyang and Changzhou rice. Medium-quality glutinous rice was sold at 37 yuan wholesale.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Flour Market Resumes Slackness —Maintained by Mai Yi-pin— <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, due to export issues not yet resolved, sales to out-of-town merchants in the market were temporarily disappointing. Trading within the city was also affected because more flour from inland areas has been arriving recently. Many flour dealers are bundling sales with miscellaneous brands, leading to a decrease in retail sales within the city. Only four to five thousand bags were directly sold by factories. The asking price for No. 2 flour from factories remains at $13.80, while returned goods with the old trademark are priced at $13.70, a slight decrease of five cents compared to the previous day. It is reported that the price of flour from Changshu and other inland areas is between $13.30 and $13.40. Suppliers fear continued dumping in Shanghai due to the lower prices in those areas.</p>
<p>Wheat: Recent sources are scarce, and trading has been rare for a long time. Aside from a few scattered deliveries to factories, there are virtually no large-scale transactions in the market. This is because the season is already past, and the recent weather has been suitable, making a good harvest of new wheat expected. Therefore, Chinese factories are reluctant to buy and are trying to suppress prices, while suppliers are unwilling to compromise too much, resulting in stagnant buying and selling.</p>

The black market rates for British and American currencies initially eased slightly but then returned to par, indicating a very mediocre situation. Trading was sluggish due to end-of-month settlement requirements. In the morning, speculative traders sold more than they bought, and external demand was slightly weak, leading to a hardening of rates. However, as inflows and outflows gradually balanced, the market returned to par. The afternoon was even more quiet, and the closing price was unchanged from the previous day. The same was true for futures.</p>
<p>Trading was also very quiet.</p>
<p>In the early morning, London's spot rate fell by 0.0625, while the forward rate remained flat. New York's silver price remained flat, and London's raw gold was stable. Exchange rates for British currency against American, Shanghai, and French currencies were all flat. The American currency was mostly flat against British currency, unchanged against Shanghai currency, and up 0.0375 against French currency. The central bank's listed rates remained the same. Banks opened with spot selling prices of 4 1/8 pence for British gold and $6.03125 for American currency, both unchanged from the previous night's close. Futures opened at the same rates, also unchanged. The market remained quiet after the opening, with some speculative traders selling off, resulting in the acceptance of May's American currency at $5.78125. HSBC's listed rates were announced unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was reduced by 50 cents. Subsequently, speculative traders continued to sell, and rates became slack due to ample positions. At that time, speculative traders sold May's American currency at $5.8125 and sold April's American currency to the Banque Belge pour l'Etranger at $6.0625. It was reported that the spread between spot and forward was still 0.25. By the time of the noon closing, rates returned to par as sellers stopped selling. British gold closed at 4 1/8 pence, and American currency closed at $6.03125. As a result, the spot and futures rates were the same as the morning opening.</p>
<p>Results showed no gains or losses.</p>

<h3 id="e107">Heavy Pressure: Difficult to Reverse the Declining Trend in the Gold Market <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's black market situation for the current "Yu Ye He Chi" (a type of gold bar) was sluggish and uninteresting. Generally, operators are unable to exert their influence due to the double pressure of mortgage and tight credit. Furthermore, the exchange market was slack and flat, so prices were difficult to raise. It was difficult for bullish players without real strength to make trades even with a daily interest rate of over 0.03. The trend of selling was difficult to stop. Initially, trading was slightly suppressed due to the increase in exchange rates, but the market soon improved, reaching a high of $5,648. However, securities firms and gold shops frequently sold, and the lowest price was only $5,605. Silver shops slightly absorbed at the noon closing, rising to $5,630. In the afternoon, retail investors suddenly bought in, and the buying momentum was temporarily strong. However, sales by silver shops and gold shops of larger amounts caused the price to retreat from a high of $5,650 to $5,630. Later, due to quiet trading, the market closed at 2:30 PM at a price of $5,635, down $24 from the previous day. Total trading volume for the day was approximately one thousand several hundred taels. Jewelry gold initially fell but then returned to par. Customs gold remained stable.</p>
<p>"Yu Ye He Chi" further down by $0.04.</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially saw a slight decline due to the increase in exchange rates. The market opened down $14, with gold shops selling twenty taels for exchange at $5,645. Later, silver shops slightly supported, pulling the price up by $3. Silver shops traded thirty taels with each other at $5,648. Securities firms and money exchange firms then sold off, pushing the price down again. Silver shops traded ten taels with each other, dropping to $5,633. Later, a certain money exchange firm showed strong buying interest, bringing the price back up by $7. Securities firms bought twenty taels from money exchange firms at $5,640. After that, securities firms repeatedly sold off, and retail investors also followed suit, causing the market to become filled with supply and drop by $25. Gold shops sold fifty taels for exchange at $5,605. After 11:30 AM, the market suddenly turned around because the exchange market futures tightened slightly. Buyers suddenly became active, and money exchange firms and gold shops returned to buying, gradually rising by $25. Gold shops sold thirty taels to silver shops, making the noon closing price $5,630. In the afternoon, the market initially opened strongly, rising $15 at the opening. Money exchange firms bought twenty taels from gold shops at $5,645. Later, money exchange firms slightly absorbed, pulling the price up another $5. Money exchange firms bought ten taels from securities firms at $5,650. Later, silver shops saw high prices and sold, and buyers stopped buying, frequently seeing a drop of $20. Silver shops sold fifty taels to securities firms at $5,630. Afterwards, a certain silver shop slightly scooped up, rising back $5. Silver shops bought ten taels from money exchange firms, making the evening closing price $5,635. As a result, it continued to fall $24 compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of $45 throughout the day. The selling price of existing cash gold at gold shops was a few dollars higher than "Yu Ye He Chi," while the buying price was $20 lower. The current price of standard gold was over $59 lower than the listed price, with almost no trading reported.</p>
<p>Jewelry gold initially fell but then remained flat.</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold at silver shops initially remained at $570 per tael at Da Tong Hang (a major gold shop), but at 10:30 AM, it decreased by $5, and at noon, it returned to $5. After that, there were no changes. As a result, Da Tong Hang still quoted $570. The prices at new gold shops were the same as the previous price, with buying prices reduced by about $15.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Exchange Drafts and Discount Rates Fall Sharply <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange drafts and notes continued to fall. Initially, it dropped to $97.50 per thousand, and later it could not hold, falling to $84. At noon, it slightly recovered to $87.50. In the afternoon, it continued to trade higher to $95, a further decrease of $5 compared to the previous day. The interbank lending rate of the Money Dealers' Association remained at 20 cents in both the morning and afternoon markets, unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Fresh Bills Continue to Decline <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the decline in the British, American, and gold exchange rates, the gold bill also followed and fell by $1. The supply and demand for British gold bills and Hong Kong bills were balanced, and the market price remained stable. The American gold bill initially rose to $16.41, but due to the approaching end of the fourth period, all firms needed legal tender, and various parties dumped their holdings, causing the market price to fall. By noon, it had retreated to $16.34. In the afternoon, supply and demand were still balanced, and the market price remained stable, but it was still down by $0.03 compared to the previous day. The demand for French franc bills was weak, and the market price continued to decline. Dutch bills also became weak again. The demand for Japanese bills slightly increased, and the evening market was slightly higher at $1.269. There were still many Korean bills supplied, and the market price became even more unsustainable, retreating to $0.983 in the evening market.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Securities: Foreign Stocks Ask for Four Days of Trading; Trading Volume Reaches $10,000,000; An Unprecedented Record Since the Establishment of the Securities Association <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The black market for domestic bonds was relatively stable yesterday morning but weak in the afternoon. Investor sentiment remained unable to recover. News was more negative than positive, and there was no sign of easing in the tight credit situation. In addition, the government's discount of bills excluded public bonds, making it inconvenient for bill holders who wanted to be active. Moreover, in the current environment of high interest rates, going long was not as profitable as lending. Therefore, apart from covering short positions, new bullish positions were extremely rare in the market. There was very little trading yesterday morning, mostly retail investors buying and Jiu Feng covering short positions. Nos. 20 and Wanchun Tong Ji Hongkang, among others, were selling. The market price varied between 5 cents and 10 cents. In the afternoon, Jiu Feng continued to cover short positions, Changji entered Ding class, and Lianyi entered Bing class and exited Jia and Yi classes. Xinchang and Renchang slightly bought in, while sellers were still very enthusiastic. Nos. 20, Lianhe, Yongxiang, Runli, and Tongkang, among others, were all selling, with Zhongxin selling regardless of price. The market price gradually declined, eventually turning weak and falling by 1.5 cents to 4.5 cents compared to the previous day. The total trading volume was approximately $800,000. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>London, 25th (Thursday) telegram: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt remained stable, with no changes in the upper and lower ranges of various bonds.</p>
<p>The stock market for various vegetables was filled with selling pressure. All good prospects temporarily disappeared, and the downward trend continued until noon, when there was a turnaround. Those closing positions did not care about the selling price at all. If buyers had not continuously maintained support, it is difficult to imagine the extent to which the downward trend would have expanded. At the close, most industrial stocks returned to their opening prices.</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson shares have suffered a severe price drop from their highest level at the beginning of the week due to unconfirmed rumors over the past few days. Yesterday, they were once again at the forefront of the wave of selling pressure, once trending weakly to a low price of $190. Fortunately, buyers persisted and did not let go, stopping each drop and rebounding to close at $193. There were no sellers in sight. There was a large trading volume in International shares, totaling 62,000 shares. They opened at $31.75 and then fluctuated between that price and $33, closing at $31.50. The buying interest in Yangtze shares was better, and the closing price was still the original opening price of $20.25. There was also a severe wind of cutting long positions in steel shares, and large numbers of shares were easily absorbed. There were buyers at $42 at the close. The price fluctuations for Shanghai Land Investment shares were moderate, and there were many buyers at the closing price of $33.50. The action of China Land and Investment shares was very unique. Although the number of long positions closing out was also astonishing, absorption was too easy, and a new high price of $33.25 was created.</p>
<p>Rubber stocks had a better trend because people generally focused too much attention on U.S. stocks, so their fluctuations were minimal. The public was satisfied with the dividend announced by Ling Zhi, as it was able to show the recent progress of the company. Ling Zhi Rubber Trust and Kangsha Lai Te all had good demand.</p>
<p>Although the trading period this week was only four days, the trading volume was the highest on record in the history of the Securities Association. Calculated by price, the total number of shares traded was less than $10,000,000.</p>
<p>Regarding Chinese stock trading, 50 shares of Y盐业 Bank shares were traded at a price of $73. London, 25th (Thursday) telegram: Today's listed prices for British Far East companies' stocks all turned for the better. Mercantile Bank shares rose 1 shilling and 3 pence to £9 5s. Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation shares each rose half a pound to £93 1/2. Kailan Mining Administration bearer shares rose 1 penny and a half to 19 shillings and 6 pence. Glucker and Lambotte Rubber shares alone fell 1 penny and a half to 18 shillings and 1 penny. The rest were unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Ling Zhi Rubber Distributes Two Dividends <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Ling Zhi Rubber Co., Ltd., managed by the British firm McBain &amp; Co. in this city, is scheduled to hold its annual general meeting on May 14. A dividend of 18 Dutch cents per share is proposed for the year ending October 1939.</p>
<p>In addition, an interim dividend will also be paid at the same time for the year ending October 1940, with a proposed dividend of 14 Dutch cents per share. The total dividend paid is 32 Dutch cents. (Based on the Dutch Bank's Java guilder buying price of 11.5 guilders, the dividend per share is equivalent to $2.88 in national currency.)</p>
<h3 id="e112">Yarn and Cloth: Factories Have Already Released Large Quantities; Cotton Yarn Still Looking Good; Why is the Spot Business So Sluggish? <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market has risen again, but the actual demand for transactions remains sluggish and has not improved. However, investor sentiment remains bullish, so the market is tight and slightly loose. However, the current chips still feel dry because a large number of transactions were made during the spring sales period. However, in the later period, it gradually entered a quiet period. In addition, the factory also released approximately 10,000 packages.</p>
<p>In the morning, the market opened, and the market sentiment continued to be good due to the improved market atmosphere in the afternoon of the previous day. The unit price for 20-count Double Horse factory orders was $1,445, immediately rising to $55. At this time, the acceptance of factory orders and the hedging of transactions for the next month continued. As a result, the market was pushed up, rising to $1,480, but the spot business was particularly sluggish. According to the daytime transaction statistics, 1,645 packages were traded, with the spot price of 20-count Double Horse rising by $20. Shenxin Factory released 1,900 packages of 20-count Double Horse at a price of $1,470 in cash. Xinsheng Factory released 400 packages of 20-count Golden Tiger at a price of $1,420, another 400 packages at a price of $1,440, and 500 packages of 14-count Golden Tiger at a price of $1,270. Furthermore, today (27th) there were 1,085 pieces of cotton yarn and 102 pieces of cotton cloth shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each gang is listed below: Tonghang 1,390; Hong Kong 255; Total 1,645</p>
<h3 id="e113">Shenxin Hedges with Indian Cotton; Spot Trading is Particularly Active <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>There were still few transactions in this cotton, but the demand for Indian cotton was relatively strong. Shenxin Factory hedged cotton because it released a large amount of cotton yarn. Other transactions were still mostly inter-dealer buying and selling. The cotton market lacked signs of improvement due to the lack of inventory and the tight credit situation. Regardless of the tight situation, the current cotton situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Xingheng $223.00 Tonghang entered 100 pieces</p>
<p>Oomra $210.50 Rong entered 500 pieces</p>
<p>Pengjiapu $251.00 Tonghang entered 400 pieces</p>
<p>Bai Luo $254.00 Also 10 pieces</p>
<p>Huocao Bao $213.00 Also 697 packages</p>
<p>Also $208.00 Also 100 packages</p>
<p>Argentina $274.00 Also 110 pieces</p>

<p>Nantai $217.50 Tonghang entered 155 packages</p>
<p>Mitelin $298.00 Also 100 pieces</p>
<p>Pila $236.00 Also 200 pieces</p>
<p>Another news item about the price of foreign cotton, New York, was particularly weak yesterday. The Wall Street market sold and partially closed out long positions, resulting in a price drop. The closing price for the near term was down 1 point, and the far term was down 5 to 7 points. The Indian cotton market rose 2 rupees along with the forecast yesterday, and Egyptian cotton fell 2 to 3 points.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton market remained active yesterday despite the approaching end of the month and extremely tight credit. However, futures trading was relatively quiet because all parties firmly believed that it would be difficult to ship on schedule and that there were many difficulties due to the unpredictable changes in the European situation. However, spot trading was extremely active, and the asking price for 42-count Mitelin was as high as $310. It is said that this was due to the sale of cheap cuts due to tight funds. The price of cotton in mid-May is generally considered to be very bullish. The factory prices for cotton, converted at an exchange rate of $6.00, are listed below:</p>
<p>20-count American Mitelin $292.50</p>
<p>20-count Also, Lower Grade $283.40</p>
<p>32-count Also $310.60</p>
<p>32-count Also, Lower Grade $300.20</p>
<p>42-count Also $313.60</p>
<p>42-count Also, Lower Grade $304.00</p>
<p>More than 2,000 pieces of Indian cotton arrived in Shanghai today, shipped from Karachi, India, on the Italian ship "Wallby" (transliteration) and docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou for unloading.</p>

<p>Yesterday, according to a Dutch telegram, "Cu Bai" (coarse white sugar) recovered slightly by about 20 cents, with a C.I.F. K.G. price of 8.715 Dutch guilders. The city's association adjusted the market price accordingly, resulting in a slight decline. The current spot price for 24 coarse white sugar was $63.30 for local warehouses, with new goods in foreign warehouses initially at $63.20, then falling to $63. The price for goods arriving on March 18 was $62.90, and the price for goods arriving on November 7 was $61.80. Transshipment remained at $50. Due to the shortage of Taikoo "Che Bai," the selling price rose another 50 cents. The price for Western warehouses B mark was $71.80, the price for CW mark was $71.50, and so on, rising by 20 to 30 cents. The price for CX mark was $71, the price for DY mark was $70.50, and the price for HX mark was $70.30. The remaining prices were largely unchanged.

<p>Pickled mustard greens have been in short supply for a long time, and the market inventory is extremely tight and almost exhausted. The market price yesterday was $150 to $160, which can be said to be extremely high.</p>

<p>Yesterday's oil market saw a significant decrease in transactions because the environment was unfavorable for long positions, resulting in a weakening of activity. Therefore, although the market was sluggish, the entire market was focused on actual goods and sales. Only five barrels of Qingdao peanut oil and ten barrels of Jiangbei soybean oil were traded.</p>
<p>Whole grains: 200 bags of Anqing soybeans, 200 bags of Wuhu soybeans, 80 bags of Chongsi sand yellow, 70 bags of Pinghu She soybeans, and 50 bags of Peidong Du soybeans were traded throughout the day. Detailed sales prices are listed in the market price section.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Woolen Fabrics: "Sharkskin" for Summer Wear; Initially from the United States, Followed by British Goods; This Summer's Arrivals are Very Abundant, with Many Colors <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Sharkskin is a newly emerging type of material in the field of suit fabrics. Because its texture is similar to silk fabrics, it has occupied a unique position in summer clothing materials in recent years, becoming popular for a time.</p>
<p>Sharkskin originally came from the United States and was initially popular in Manila and Luzon. However, it gradually began to appear in the Shanghai market in the previous year. However, most of it was sent from Hong Kong. Until last year, a few Shanghai woolen fabric businesses also began to order weaving from abroad, not limited to the United States. Therefore, pure American goods were difficult to find in the Shanghai market last year, while British goods became popular for a time, with prices ranging from $7 to $8 per yard.</p>
<p>In view of the popularity of sharkskin last summer, many woolen fabric firms began to order weaving. As a result, this spring's arrivals are very abundant, and the colors have become more numerous than in previous years. American goods are particularly abundant, with colors such as yellow, gray, and white. The width is around 38 inches. The price before delivery was around one US dollar. The current general retail price is between $25 and $26. However, British goods have not decreased in color, because their material is slightly thinner, and the price is also cheaper, around $15 to $16, about $10 less than American products. In addition, there is also a type of Japanese goods, priced between $5 and $6 per yard, but the surface can be compared with Western goods, but the body is far inferior to British and American goods.

<p>A Monk Risking His Life to Solicit Donations</p>
<p>In the Desheng Bridge area of Hangzhou, generally known as Jiacheng Lane, there was once a King Kong Temple, the former site of the Southern Song Dynasty, a solid and solemn large temple. It is said that a certain monk during the Qianlong and Jiaqing eras completed his meritorious deeds and ascended to heaven, and even today the elders can still talk about it. Since the Ochre Bandits disturbed Zhejiang, the temple was destroyed, and now only dilapidated walls remain. Last winter, an old monk settled here, determined to restore the old rules and rebuild the temple, and he solicited donations for a long time, but nothing came to fruition. He recruited one or two monks, and they discussed with each other, saying that without a shocking event to stir up the city and countryside, it would be impossible to obtain a large sum of money. The old monk was already over seventy years old and was about to die, so he planned to risk his life to fulfill this grand wish. It would be enough if the mountain gate could be rebuilt, and the old monk could be revered as the founder of the mountain. The disciples all gladly accepted the teaching. The monk first spread the word everywhere several months ago, predicting the date of his death and that he must be cremated immediately three days after Nirvana, otherwise it would hinder his ascent to heaven. Therefore, on that day, devout men and women all donated money to form good karma, but the esteemed officials of Renhe and Qiantang counties had also heard about it early on and initially dismissed it as a clever trick by monks and Taoists to collect money. When they heard that there were too many people seeing him off to his death, they brought officials and coroners to the place on the following day to personally verify. When they arrived, there were countless men and women along the way burning incense and bowing in worship. They immediately summoned his disciples for questioning, who replied that it was for the monk's successful ascension to heaven. The county officials saw that the high platform was filled with stacked firewood, and on the platform was a high niche, sealed on all sides, requiring a large amount of money to be named. The monk had set the date for cremation on the sixteenth night, so the disciples wanted to wait until the time to start the fire. The Xing county official suspected that he had committed suicide by taking poison, so he made his statement mysterious, wanting to open the niche for examination. The Zhou county official thought that since he had already passed away, there was no need to look at him again, but cremation within three days was too fast, and he should be ordered to wait until seven days later to see what happened. He ordered his disciples to investigate if they disobeyed and secretly instructed the constables to guard day and night in shifts.</p>

<h3 id="e119">The Science of Living <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>Psychologist Dr. A. Adler once wrote a book called "Science of Living," which, from the perspectives of education and psychology, provides appropriate guidance on three important issues in life—social problems, occupational problems, and romantic relationship problems. It is a good book that is both popular and practical.</p>
<p>Dr. Adler is a respected authority on individual psychology and developmental psychology, and his writings are highly regarded. In this book, his discussion of the influence of "Inferiority Complex" and "Superiority Complex" on life is extremely insightful, indeed providing much guidance for our actual lives. He believes that abnormal behavior in human psychology originates entirely from adverse childhood environments. Educators should pay close attention to training children, cultivate their healthy psychological development, and make every effort to develop their social interests, guiding their emotions in beneficial directions. This precisely aligns with the key points of modern mental hygiene.</p>
<p>Recent psychological research has shown a trend towards close application to life. This specialized academic field makes a significant contribution to the improvement of human life. Major discoveries in psychology are often generated by practical needs. Many theories and experiments help us solve many problems in life. Not only do the abnormal behaviors of psychiatric patients require psychological research for remediation and prevention, but also willpower, emotions, habits, thinking, etc., which are most closely related to daily life, must adopt psychological principles to solve difficult problems.</p>
<p>Traditional views believe that life and science have no connection. Science only explores the principles of the natural and social environment and is a purely academic pursuit. They forget the application aspects of science. Since psychology is an independent science, its research should aim to solve life's difficulties. Human life will become more meaningful and valuable because of psychological research. The content of our lives will be enriched, and our lifestyles will be improved, making life the most rational and sublime activity, filtering out and discarding all the stale dregs of life. As Dr. Adler said, "This science (referring to psychology) naturally emphasizes practicality because, with the assistance of knowledge, we can change and correct our attitudes."</p>
<p>The scope of life is very broad, encompassing all human activities. Psychologists often say that life is a purposeful expression. Muddled, casual, and aimless living without a clear goal cannot be considered a proper attitude towards life. An ideal life should have educational value, not only in developing oneself but also in improving society and benefiting humanity. Therefore, the highest function of human life lies in constantly conducting objective self-criticism at any time and place, continuously identifying the shortcomings of life, and changing and correcting them. Therefore, we must absorb more knowledge about life.</p>
<p>Around us, there are many people living in frustration, sorrow, depression, and negativity. They lack faith and enthusiasm for life, leading to decadence, depression, and helplessness. Unless they awaken as soon as possible, absorb and refine scientific knowledge related to life improvement, eradicate the bad habits of sluggishness, cultivate healthy and normal emotions, enrich the meaning of life, and unleash their inner potential, they will forever be trapped in the bottomless abyss of darkness without any hope of extrication.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Warmth and Loveliness <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Lianfang</p>
<p>It is the late spring season, once again the season of lush grasses and flying orioles in the Jiangnan region. The earth has received warmth, and everything seems to be awakening. "The year's plan starts in spring" is precisely because spring is warm and conducive to getting things done, making it particularly important. Apart from humans, warmth also offers many benefits to other animals and plants. The world's organisms are most abundant and developed in temperate zones. Flowers and plants germinate in spring, and birds and beasts are particularly lively in spring. According to the results of psychological research, we know that both extreme cold and extreme heat can reduce people's attention. Therefore, the most civilized and prosperous parts of the world are the temperate zones. Temperate zones produce more great people, more contributions, and more inventions. The philosopher Russell wanted to write articles in the sun, and the poet Byron feared the cold, like a sheep. Milton's Paradise Lost was written in spring, and Goethe's poems were written in autumn. Someone has compiled statistics on great works of world literature, with May having the most, followed by April and September, and January, October, December, and February having the fewest.</p>
<p>Besides the warmth of the climate, the warmth of the soul is also extremely precious. When a family joyfully gathers, both body and mind feel immense comfort. Having an interest in one's career can also warm the soul. "If you have done nothing wrong during the day, you will not be alarmed by high gates in the middle of the night." This is certainly due to the comfort and ease brought by a warm soul. Contact with good teachers and helpful friends, and harmonious relationships between people, further adds to the warmth of the soul.</p>
<p>Warmth can make us feel the joy of life and can make us approach the world with a positive attitude. Therefore, we must work hard in a timely manner and not give up the warm days that nature bestows upon us. At the same time, we should not waste or abandon the warmth needed by the soul.</p>
<h3 id="e121">God Above All (3) <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Have you understood the difference between putting God first? If you trust God, you will trust your fellow man. Loving God means loving your fellow man. Believing in God means believing that this world is God's home, and you are children of a loving Father. Believing that God is great, creative, wise, and powerful, and that He is constantly working in the universe, you will believe that justice, virtue, and love are the greatest forces in the world. Believing in God, you are convinced that loyalty, faith, and love are valuable and will ultimately triumph. Such faith enables you to cope with all the difficulties and disappointments in the world because you believe that "good" can overcome "evil," "truth" can overcome "falsehood," and "love" can overcome "evil," and eternal life can overcome death. A person who lives with the consciousness of God will always have a victorious attitude. No matter what comes, he will always face it fearlessly and unashamedly. God supports him and takes care of him to the end because he is part of God's eternal will. At one of the most shocking moments in religious history, an unknown prophet in exile wrote these great words, "Those who wait for the Lord will gain new strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint." When the Hebrews were exiled and returned to rebuild their spiritual culture and renew the foundations of their faith, the prophet led them before God, preparing them for that work. Waiting on God can increase your strength and give you unprecedented power. He told them that putting God before their work would lead to three things: being able to fly, run, and walk. In other words, being close to God provides endless encouragement, and regardless of circumstances, one can face everything with absolute fearlessness. We must learn to walk the path of life tirelessly and unyieldingly. The hope of today's world lies in finding God within people and expressing Him in life.

<h3 id="e122">Post-Marriage Confessions <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Jin</p>
<p>I remember when I got married with beautiful dreams and a happy heart, I never thought that I would encounter so many things that I find unpleasant to see and hear. Just speaking of our love, although I can't say that our love has entered the grave, love no longer inspires us, immersing our body and mind in it.</p>
<p>He gets up early every morning, eats breakfast in a hurry, and has to rush to the office by eight o'clock. Whether I get up with him or not, he seems to no longer care about my warm concern. Before marriage, even if I walked an extra distance with him, he would be overjoyed and thank me endlessly. He comes home after six o'clock every night, dragging a tired body to bed, and has nothing to say to me at all. "Heart-to-heart talks" are even more out of the question. There is no more consideration or gentleness between us. All our relationship is built entirely on the name of husband and wife.</p>
<p>This is so painful for me! It's not that I necessarily need love, as if I can't live without it. But my life now is so devoid of emotion, everything is cold and stark, and I only have nominal relationships with people. A lively girl suddenly finds herself trapped in this eternally icy and snowy family. The spiritual loneliness and pain she feels are indescribable, and her transformation is self-evident.</p>
<p>In my own home, I have parents, brothers, and sisters. We are lively, my family is full of vitality, and my life seems to have always shone with extraordinary brilliance. The harmony and enthusiasm of our family filled me with infinite hope and joy for life. After I met him, I felt that life was even more fulfilling, as if I were living in a loving mist, full of sweetness. I fantasized that if I married him, wouldn't everything be even more perfect? Who knew that after we got married, things didn't turn out as I had ever imagined. I initially overlooked the fact that I was going to live in a different environment.</p>
<p>Look at my current family. I have a mother-in-law, uncles, aunts, sisters-in-law, and a large group of people. This is a completely authentic and typical Chinese extended family. They see me as a stranger, and of course, they don't develop any feelings for me. Not only that, but they also feel that there is one more person, and the family has one more nuisance. Although I have never had any direct conflicts with them in terms of opinions. I get up early, do my things, and he goes to his office. From then until evening, every day, every day, I spend my precious youthful years in this way. I am even more reluctant to casually step out of the room for no reason. The world outside the room is cold and hypocritical. They don't like me much either, saying that I am a modern woman, and they don't talk to me casually unless it is necessary. This is exactly what I want. To be honest, I have nothing to say to this large group of people except for perfunctory words. They all consider themselves old-fashioned and think that I, a modern woman, am not compatible with them. I really don't understand where I am modern.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Ambition <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Ru</p>
<p>He who does not set his ambition when young, will accomplish nothing when old.</p>
<p>What is ambition? There would be many different explanations for it, I'm afraid? Many people are without ambition, all they have is how to stay alive, in other words: "Take each day as it comes," and that's all.</p>
<p>A person has ambition pertaining to a particular time in their life in a given era. The ambition of one's youth changes in middle age, and the ambition of middle age changes in old age; people whose ambition remains constant are few. If such a person exists, they are definitely a hero or a great person.</p>
<p>Having ambition alone is useless. What "ambition" needs is "action" and "effort," and above all, one must have "perseverance." If these four are all present, then the door to success will be opened, just waiting for people to enter. "Time" is the enemy of ambition. If one slackens off even slightly, "Father Time" will quietly slip away, and even the greatest ambition will become a bubble.</p>
<p>If you have an ambition, just do it quietly. When you succeed, everyone will naturally admire you. If you have an ambition but don't focus on realizing it, but instead keep talking about it, boasting to others, then people will feel infinitely annoyed by your ambition.</p>
<p>Some people's ambitions are very admirable. Why? It is because they have the spirit of knowing something is impossible but still trying to do it, or they are upright and honorable, never hoping to enjoy the beautiful fruits after their ambition is realized. Many revolutionary heroes, such as Mazzini of Italy, Lenin of Russia, and Wen Tianxiang and Shi Kefa of China, as well as Sun Yat-sen and Huang Xing in modern times, are all people of this kind.</p>
<p>Many people say they are not afraid of hardship and will definitely realize their ambitions, but in reality, when their ambition is not even half completed, they have already changed their attitude. When Hong Chengchou and Wu Sangui were young, didn't they want to stand tall and be upright people? But when it came to the point of profit and wealth, even their personality could be sacrificed, and their nation and country could be offered up. If they had died a few years earlier, who would say they weren't good people?</p>

<p>— Qing</p>
<p>Recently, the chief official of the Labor Service Department of the German National Socialist Party proposed that future newlyweds must first work voluntarily in the Labor Service Department for a considerable period of time, and only those who obtain a "passing" certificate will be allowed to marry. The chief official believes that this type of service will not only be sufficient to guarantee a happy married life, but also serve as clear proof of the following slogan: "The best school for cultivating the character of young people is the voluntary Labor Service Department."</p>
<p>He also advocated that in the future, not only newlyweds must obtain this type of labor "passing" certificate before they are allowed to register their marriage, but all young people under the age of twenty-five must receive this training. Apprentices in various trades must also obtain this "passing" certificate before they are promoted to master craftsmen, and even all doctors and lawyers must first have this certificate before they are allowed to practice.</p>

<p>Maternity department of Leren Hospital offers low-cost delivery services. Director Dr. Zhang Yongming is knowledgeable and experienced.</p>
<p>"Everyone knows that childbirth is the most important and dangerous thing for women. Because of this, it is essential to have basic knowledge about childbirth. This is especially important for first-time mothers. If the fetus is difficult to deliver, there is excessive bleeding after childbirth, or there is a fever after childbirth, these can all endanger the life of the mother. However, most women in our country are ashamed of physical examinations, etc., by doctors. Whenever they give birth, they rely solely on village midwives, which often leads to the loss of lives. Playing around with life is truly lamentable. For the sake of the mother and for the sake of the baby, women should make an appointment with a obstetrician as soon as they become pregnant. All matters during pregnancy, childbirth, and after childbirth should be entrusted to their guidance, so that both the mother and the fetus will benefit. During pregnancy, pathological changes are unpredictable, or the position of the fetus may change, etc., which can all be avoided with the guidance of a doctor and prevented before it happens. In view of this, Leren Hospital at 70 Gu Ba Lu has specially hired obstetrician Zhang Yongming and several head midwives to be in charge of delivery matters. All obstetric equipment is extremely complete. Recently, Dr. Zhang has compiled a book entitled "Mothers' Guide," which is based on scientific medicine and comprehensively describes the essential points of pregnancy diagnosis, pregnancy hygiene, pregnancy warnings, management during labor, management after childbirth, infant care, infant feeding, care of newborn infants, and crises of newborn infants, which is indeed a must-read for general pregnant women. Five thousand copies of the book have been printed and are available for free. It is said that the hospital charges low fees for delivery and offers special discounts for purchasing prenatal care vouchers in advance."</p>

<h3 id="e126">Xiong Shi-i's New Work "Professor from Peking" - Actually a Counter-Propaganda for Business Gain. This Kind of Playwright Should Be Strictly Investigated <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Haixing</p>
<p>Professor Xiong Shi-i made both fame and fortune overseas with his English script of "Xue Pinggui and Wang Baochuan," and has since lived a comfortable life in London on royalties. Recently, he completed an original script called "Professor Come From Peking," a three-act play that lacks both a central idea and descriptive skills. The general idea is about a university professor Zhang, who was initially a leader of the student movement in the May Fourth era and also a member of the Communist Party. Later, he betrayed the students and his thoughts degenerated. By the time of the Northern Expedition, he joined the Wuhan organization after the split between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and his behavior became even more corrupt, such as playing with female staff and female students. On the eve of "August 13," he suddenly became a staunch supporter of the war of resistance. The play depicts Zhang as a powerful figure behind Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and the Sino-Japanese war was instigated by this person, etc. The whole play has many so-called gimmicks, all from Zhang's mouth, such as: "Tomorrow I will go to see Chiang Kai-shek!" "Chen Youren discussed with me the recovery of the British concession," "Fourth Mistress call Song Ziwen"... etc. When it was performed in England, the foreigners laughed endlessly.</p>
<p>When a certain playwright told a reporter about the outline of the play, he said with emotion: "Xiong Shi-i's view on the war of resistance is very superficial, as if all corrupt elements can become heroes of the war of resistance once the flames of war are ignited. The so-called Zhang, in the eyes of foreigners, may be thought to have hidden allusions, but according to what we know, there is definitely no such person behind Chairman Chiang today. Xiong Shi-i's "Professor from Peking" is actually entirely for business purposes. He not only does not make favorable propaganda for the war of resistance, but also exposes the weaknesses of the nation, which is very regrettable."</p>

<h3 id="e127">Wenji Returns to Han <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaotian</p>
<p>"Wenji Returns to Han" is one of Cheng Yanqiu's famous plays, with heavy singing and the best of all plays. Before this, no one had performed it, and after this, the skills of the performers were far inferior to Cheng's, not worth commenting on.</p>
<p>Among the rhythms of singing, the most formal in its form, the greatest in its scope, the most meticulous in its structure, and the one that occupies the greatest importance in the whole play is the slow three-beat. In the last three scenes of this play, there are three long sections of slow three-beat in Xipi Erhuang Fanerhuang sung in a row. It goes without saying how strenuous and noisy it is, so Yanqiu is reluctant to sing it easily. In his previous two visits to Shanghai, every time this play was performed, I would go to listen. When singing the Fanerhuang section at the Tomb of Zhao Jun, he would show signs of declining energy and fatigue. This time, even until the last section of Yaoban, he still had energy to spare, showing Yanqiu's skill has improved again.</p>
<p>The story of this play is only about Cai Wenji being captured in the chaos and forced to marry the Left Sage King, and being redeemed and returning to her country, which is not very interesting. And the emotion of the whole play is only the word "sadness." Being widowed is sad, being captured in the chaos is also sad, living in a foreign land is sad, and returning to her country is thinking of her children. There is nothing that is not sad. Visiting Zhao Jun's tomb evokes a feeling of sympathy for those with similar experiences, so why not be sad? It's easy to act, it's hard to express emotions. It's easy to express alternating emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness, but it's hard to express one emotion from beginning to end. Although the sadness of being widowed and the sadness of separation are the same, the feelings that give rise to the sadness are different. Yanqiu seems to have understood this meaning. Can those who study Cheng understand this meaning? Can the audience appreciate this meaning?</p>
<p>There is one scene in this play that I can't quite understand, but there is no other good way to handle it. Yanqiu seems to need to find a way to arrange it to make it more perfect. After Li Jue's army returned to court, the next scene is Cao Cao sitting in his tent, and the time has passed more than ten years. Without reading the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" thoroughly, how would one know the era of Li Jue and Chang Guo and the era of Cao Cao's reign? In a movie, a subtitle could be placed in between, indicating that it was more than ten years later, but this is absolutely impossible in Peking opera. Or the scene with the maid and the two young masters could be moved in between, and then Cao Cao could appear, but I don't know if it would seem disjointed.</p>

<p>— Liu</p>
<p>After Mei Xi and Xinhua argued over the ranking in advertisements, movie fans generally had different opinions. Some regretted Xinhua's abandonment of Mei Xi, while others thought that Mei Xi shouldn't have protested over such a small matter. According to well-informed sources, Mei Xi had signed a long-term contract with Yihua at the end of last year. He is one of the main characters in the already filmed "Yan Xijiao," and is currently starring in "The Biography of the Martyrs." When Li Qinian comes to Shanghai in two months, he will co-star with Li in a modern and historical drama. From this, it can be seen that Mei had already had a relationship with Yihua a long time ago, and had obtained the consent of Xinhua in advance. As for what his intentions are from now on, we can only wait for the facts to prove it.</p>

<p>— Xinggu</p>
<p>After performing "New Mei Luoxiang," the "Zhonglü" troupe performed "Two Worlds," written by Wu Bolao.</p>
<p>"Two Worlds" was once all the rage in the mainland. The plot depicts young people in two different environments doing sacred work. On the other hand, it exposes the shameless ugliness of those who have lost their souls.</p>
<p>Li Jingbo, who plays the unscrupulous merchant Bai Cishan, is extremely skilled in his expressions. Especially at the end, after being scolded by Bai Qinghong, the embarrassing expression that is both funny and sad is very satisfying.</p>
<p>Sun Jinglu, who plays Bai Qinghong, played the role of a child in "Thunderstorm," "The Arms Merchant," and "The True Story of Ah Q." It is said that this is her first time playing an adult role as Qinghong. Her performance in the play is not seen as incompetent. The tragic and passionate confession at the end is so touching. Ge Xin's Liu Jicheng is also very good. Huang He and others are competent.</p>

Next, it will be followed by "Yandou Pass," starring Yuan Meiyun. Meiyun has not had any new works released for a long time, and it is expected that it will cause a great sensation.</p>
<p>After "Yue Fei," Jin Cheng will screen "Li Amao and Dongfang Shuo." This film is from the hand of Xu Zhuodai, a "lacking in virtue" masterpiece, and the whole film is full of satirical jokes.</p>
<p>The mysterious girl Tan Ying makes her debut in ancient costume in "Pan Qiaoyun," and her appearance is surprisingly beautiful. Wang Yin consistently maintains a tough style, playing Shi Sanlang, who stabs the adulterous woman to death.
