<h3 id="c14">問題中之土耳其動嚮 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>昨日評述最近醞釀中的國際動態，嘗謂當前的世界大戰中，土耳其是問題的國家之一；今日請即以土國爲中心，試作申論。蓋對壘中的國際兩大陣營，將因土國決定其友敵向背而使全局逈殊其今後的發展；故關係所及，實甚遠大，而蔚爲國際的問題。本問題的主要含義：（一）德義兩國業已發動其東進，土國對此所作反響，將使德義自陸上瓦解英帝國的工作，以及宰制英國在亞非兩洲殖民地的計畫，直接受其成敗利鈍的影響。（二）英國自有其近東計畫，土國對之，將取何種態度？這是足以決定整個近東形勢的；同時，對於英國的整個軍事布置，也會發生莫大作用。（三）土蘇兩國間，正在加緊其外交折衝，其內容如何，成就如何，尙無確聞；然終有推動整個國際局勢的莫大可能。</p>
<p>回顧一年來的歐洲形勢，變動强烈。從地理方面作鳥瞰，西起大西洋，東至黑海，北自北海與波羅的海，南到地中海，除去蘇聯勢力發展所及而外，整個的歐洲大陸，幾乎全部相繼沉淪於德義勢力的支配之下。從國際形勢方面作鑒別，向所謂「中歐」·「東歐」·「巴爾幹」等集團，到現在，均已一一先後消失。一年以前，土耳其因爲地跨歐亞兩洲，又因韃靼尼爾及博斯普羅斯兩海峽的國際糾紛，常有被牽進國際政治的漩渦可能；但土國却能運用了所謂「巴爾幹同盟」的屛蔽，多方應付，置身歐洲的動盪之外。到了現在，這個優厚環境已經不復存在了。蓋其北鄰羅馬尼亞，最近已投進德義懷抱。土國因此在黑海方面已與德義相交接。在其西邊，隔着保加利亞與希臘兩國的一條狹小地帶，現在亦得遙望德義勢力的澎湃洶湧而來。總之，他在歐洲，因爲這一帶形勢的由漸次兼併而趨單純，但見德義與蘇聯及英國三大勢力互相角逐，弱小國風靡，使土國不復有結盟自保的餘地。此後歐洲局面的一切演變，成爲土國利害興衰攸關的事件；使他不能再像以前的躱閃，亦不容他袖手旁觀了。</p>
<p>就歐洲局勢而論，德義對英的海空戰爭，一時沒有勝利的可能；現在亦即所謂對英閃電戰略。暫無成功之望。今後所剩對英的唯一途徑，祇有循着陸路：在亞洲，以義大利保護地葉門與法國代管地叙里亞爲根據；在非洲，以義屬索馬里蘭與阿此西尼亞等地爲根據；如此兩岸呼應並進，先謀控制了紅海，然後徐圖開展。亞洲方面由阿拉伯半島，經過伊蘭，阿富汗，俾路支，進窺印度；非洲方面，先通過英埃蘇丹，埃及，與法屬西非，打成一片，再南下，直向英屬南非聯邦。德義此項陸上進攻計畫，近來已有種種跡象可尋；而德義的控制了羅馬尼亞，並對保加利亞與希臘的所作壓迫，以及義大利的攻佔英屬索馬里蘭，是其推進計畫的發軔。至於計畫的能吾實現，一視英國的抵抗，一視土耳其的態度。</p>
<p>英國對於德義這一計畫，自必早在預料之中。遠在去年歐戰爆發前，英國就預先担保了羅馬尼亞與希臘的安全；更進一步，與波蘭及土耳其締立盟的。蓋英國所企圖，要在對於德國，在東歐與南歐兩面，形成德國必須東西兩綫作戰的形勢；至少亦可藉此堵塞了德國瓦解英帝國的陸上途徑。時閱一年，波蘭已經亡了國，羅馬尼亞已經取了極端反英的態度；希臘在德義環伺之下，除非英國派兵直接幫牠抵抗外，事實上對抗不了德義的前進。總之，英國一年前在這一方面所拉攏的與國，現在祗剩一個土耳其；於是這幾個月來，更由兩方面加緊籌謀補救：一面將海軍分頭駐泊於紅海地中海各港口，將大批陸軍由印度等地向非洲及近東增防外；一面加緊這一方面的外交活動，企圖在東南歐等地陣綫瓦解之後，再組成一個近東及非洲的集團；埃及，內志王國，伊拉克，伊蘭等國，皆在綱羅之列，英國當然是集團領袖，而土耳其則爲强有力的要角。最近，由艾登作非洲與近東之行，使命即在於此。如果土耳其與內志皆能同意於英國的這一企圖，則英國在這一方面的軍事負担，就可以大大減輕了。</p>
<p>英國企圖的對象，却非英國所得指揮盡如己意。但試將蘇聯態度參酌其間，便可見到局勢的非常微妙。直到目前爲止，這一方面已經顯見的國際分野，大槪是：（一）蘇土之間，有着非常密切的關係；因土耳其雖非社會主義國家，却是社會主義世界的屛障，乃爲蘇聯最可靠的友邦之一；而土耳其亦引蘇聯爲弱小民族對抗强隣時最可靠的友邦。（二）英土之間，結有互助協定；協定的唯一例外，乃爲蘇聯反對時，土耳其對英得解除履行協定的義務。（三）蘇德之間，有互不侵犯協定，但在德國與土耳其萬一發生戰爭時，協定便會立刻失效。所以，在德義方面。最好竭力避免牽動土耳其；在英國方面，却最好是拉土耳其駢肩作戰；在土耳其自身，雖然形勢已經不允許牠再置身事外了，但怎樣斟酌得失，權衡輕重，以善保自己的利益，這是最大亦最難的問題。</p>
<p>最近在加緊進行中的蘇土外交折衝，不問其內容如何，成就如何，將會多多少少的予土耳其態度以直接影響。再放開一步看，凡此醞釀與趨歸，仍將視蘇聯與英美，及蘇聯與德義日等分別進行着的外交而轉移。其間允値注意的，還在蘇聯對整個國際局勢的基本方略，與所體認的目前歐戰的根本性質，以及所感覺英德決定勝敗後所加於蘇聯安危的程度之差。</p>

<p>至留日英僑、昨日本埠已接獲東京電訊、知英國駐日大使館、現正對彼輩施以勸吿、盼彼等早日離日、以時局動盪、商業及生活情形、旣均不安定、無留戀必要、故駐日英大使館已加急辦理僑民登記矣、但英方所採態度、與美國相同、勸願意離日者早日撤退、係自動而非强迫也、</p>
<p>香港婦孺　業經撤退</p>
<p>至香港英國婦孺之撤退、業已成爲旣成事實、其他遠東各地之有英僑者、英當局亦採同樣態度、此足以說明英官塲對於遠東局勢之意向、且日本國內報紙、最近時將英美二名詞、聯合一處記載、責英美聯合破壊日本在遠東之計劃、並指滇緬路之重開、爲英美企圖威脅日本之明證、實卽無異警吿日本國人、謂將爲二國有發生戰事之可能、</p>
<p>上海商業　遭受影響</p>
<p>但上海若干英商行如輪船公司等、營業仍極發達、平時大商行之感職員過多而欲加以裁撤者、現以一部英人已返國投效、已感無此需要、據估計現滬上英僑速婦孺在內、共爲一萬一千人、凡本埠各職業界皆莫不有英人挿足其間、英商洋行爲滬上對外貿易之骨幹、彼輩旅滬之歷史、已達百年之久、設一旦撤退、則對滬埠必爲一絕大之打擊也、</p>
<p>無力美僑　已請援助</p>
<p>本埠美國商會及美僑聯合會、根據二十一日舉行聯席會議之議決案、昨日致電華盛頓國務院、請求對於無力由遠東乘船返美之之僑民、予以經濟之援助、使其得以撤退、同時並請求减低旅費及行李傢具之水脚費、</p>
<p>郵船票價　並未增高</p>
<p>本埠若干美僑、對於美國及馬遜兩郵船公司所定之昂貴旅費、均感焦慮、據該兩公司駐滬代理人昨對記者稱、來滬載運美僑撤退之四郵船、其票價均照向例、並未增高、其所以被認爲昂貴之原因、乃因各該郵船艙位均爲一律等級、不若普通總統號郵船之有三等艙也、一般相信總統郵船公司對於减低旅費一事、不能自主、故减費之申請、應直接向華盛頓國務院請求也、</p>
<p>蒙德萊輪　兼灣澳洲</p>
<p>聞馬遜郵船公司之蒙德萊號郵船、返美時將取道澳洲、由上海至舊金山需時的三十天、平常由上海直放舊金山之郵船、則祗二星期卽可到達、據稱該船多行二星期、對旅費並不收額外費用、</p>

<h3 id="c79">金融　外滙前途之兩面觀　若頃 <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>滬戰以後，由於本埠地位特殊，各地資財，相率依附。一部商業資力，亦失去彈性，游資壅塞，於是掀起了物價高浪，患得患失，極端震盪。惟外匯黃金在過去兩年中，有擁必益，緣是資產所寄托，驚趨是途，然法幣斵傷，於此爲甚。逮近頃英國限制英鈔輸入，美國借款更充量接濟，國際形勢，漸次蛻化，外滙間乃起憬憧，前途如何，當亟欲有所揣測，姑綜合各種因素而作兩而觀之分析。</p>
<p>足使匯率緊縮者</p>
<p>（一）淪陷區之出口貨物，遭遇限制，出超勢必减弱，入超雖已减低，但米糧等之主要物品，爲數仍鉅，或因此需要而吸引多頭附和。</p>
<p>（二）滬市資金充斥，存款减息，擁有大量現款，易被驅入外滙途徑。</p>
<p>（三）美國尙未參戰，而貨幣地位，遠較任何他國爲優，設遇時局惡化，由於本市股票等出籠所獲之資，或將用作購買外匯。</p>
<p>（四）由香港及南亞他處流入上海之資金，漸見减少。</p>
<p>（五）各銀行擁有之外滙，欲維持紙面盈餘使匯率不致放長，或有購買外匯之傾向。</p>
<p>（六）上海之中立地位，苟受威脅，則中國政府或將大量購買外滙。</p>
<p>（七）如美國放棄上海，則流通於本市之法幣，想將遭遇不利。</p>
<p>（八）由於目前近遠期接近，套頭籌碼甚少，凡不急於出籠之投機者，可出輕微之利息，將籌碼展爲遠期。</p>
<p>足使滙率放長者</p>
<p>（一）滬市商業衰落，進口商外滙需要减少。</p>
<p>（二）英美對華援助，有更進一步之可能</p>
<p>（三）法幣貶値，已達高度，以後可趨和綏，如美國捲入戰爭漩渦，則美元對於法幣之比値，將急速貶降，此點使法幣處於有利地位。</p>
<p>（四）遠東情形若再惡化，船運業將受惡劣影響，因而减少進口滙票需要。</p>
<p>（五）如美僑掃數撤退，或將凍滯在華一切帳款。</p>
<p>（六）金鎊自由滙率抬高，其原因或由於英政府統制，或由於供給缺乏，皆能使美滙放長。</p>
<p>（七）市內投機性之多頭籌碼過多，投機者因預期之緊縮，未能實現，急於出籠，凡對中國有利之消息，或隱含美國將捲入遠東漩渦之消息，皆易引起此種出籠。</p>
<p>（八）如本市情形惡化，則各銀行或將售出外滙，取得現款以應存戶之提存。</p>

<p>— 遂眞</p>
<p>朋友：你來信向我訴苦，認爲有無數的惡魔，環繞在你週圍，使你衣無以溫，食無以飽，整天價爲生活而奮鬥，結果與你所期望的，恰恰相反，於是你詛咒社會給予你的不平，把整個人生，看得淡然無味，意興頽唐，終於抵不過層層壓力，便被社會把你排擠到牛角尖裏去。</p>
<p>親愛的朋友！在這裏我吿訴你，你的思想已經歪曲了，人牛的歷程，正如波濤汹湧中一葉扁舟，要逆流而上，盡你最大的努力，雖老死而無怨，縱然達不到你理想中的目的地，但是你偉大的精神與人格，可以做後來者的楷模，你並不虛此一生，如果你是隨波逐流，那便只有自趨於減亡之一途，爲社會所淘汰是意中事，同惰於你的也只是一些弱者。</p>
<p>你爲衣食所累，大部份自然是社會問題，但是你小部份還是在你自己，社會上一班人能够豐衣足食，有的是叨祖先餘蔭，有的是從投機取巧或壓榨中得來的，但也有是憑一雙手一副腦子換來的，前者不足以爲法，後者却可倣效，上帝賦予人類的五官四肢沒有兩樣，耍不是你有殘疾的話，那麽人類應做及能做的事，眞多得不可勝計，求生的方法，僅在於你做與不做，假若你平時是一位長衫階級中人，當你長杉不能維持的一天，你不妨毅然的去做勞工，你千萬不能爲物慾所蒙蔽，更不要把自己看得太偉大，以爲不屑降級以求，比方說，乘着一九四零年的汽車，自然較安步當車輕鬆爽快，錦衣玉食，總較布衣菜飯舒適可口，人生的痛苦，衆半由這相反地得來的，由儉而奢，易如反掌，孟子曾經昭示我們要勞其筋骨，餓其體膚，才有肩重任的可能，你只要不到衣不蔽體食不到口的境地時，你的後面，終還有不如你的人，這樣一想，你便可心平氣和忘却一切艱苦而理頭前進了，鼓勇前進雖可以成功，但亦不能確定，前面已經和你說過，總之請你把吃苦兩個字，看作是當然的，超級的享受，不過是一時的僥倖，你想維持着水準的生活，祗在於你的毅力和決心，在目前的環境下，不要過樂觀，不必太悲觀，手與腦，理智與情感，都要同時並用，歷史上不少偉人，從沒有因爲生活的艱苦，便挫折了志氣，你有多餘的時間，最好多讀些名人的傳記，給予你的啟示，無疑地更精闢而詳盡，等到你荊棘中步入平坦大道的開始。，只談到這裏，以後有機會的話，不妨冉來討論一下。祝你精神愉快！</p>
<h3 id="c99">猜謎騙郵票 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— 文</p>
<p>最近有過幾家廣吿公司和商號主辦過猜謎贈獎，猜中最多的就有名貴物品可得，這倒是確確實實的，聽說參加的人每次都很踴躍。</p>
<p>狡猾之徒看透了這種心理，於是念頭一轉，就想在這上面得些「外快」。上月三日有一不具名的猜謎廣吿，謎面三十個，頭獎二名，每名各得××公司禮券五十元，其餘第二三四等名次都有相當獎品可得，定於上月底揭曉，通信處是郵箱×××號，參加猜謎的須附郵票五分，否則無效。當時我們就有些起疑，然經過好意的解釋，以爲附郵五分或者是限制之意，也就不介意了。那知直到今日，還未見揭曉，才斷定是一騙局。我想被騙的人必不在少。</p>
<p>大家不要小視了五分郵票，那騙子的算盤是打得很精的，舉例說吧，假使參加的有五百人，他也可騙到廿五元；有五千人，就有二百五十元了。參加的人超過此數也未可知。橫豎除了一天廣吿費和郵箱租費而外，他是不費別的本錢的。日前又有一家××猜謎的猜謎廣吿在報上出現，頭獎是××公司禮券一百元，是否又是一騙局，且看事實證明吧。</p>
<p>上海滑頭事眞多，我們要處處當心，以免受騙。我現在得了一個小小秘訣，不妨吿訴大家，那就是第一不要貪小便宜，第二凡是要寄去郵票鈔票多少的，部不要去上當。</p>
<h3 id="c100">鬼甲：現在的世界上眞是不得了，白米要賣八九十元一擔，叫人怎麽生活呢？　　鬼乙：我們運氣可眞不壞，早點離了世界，要不然我們也該在世上吃苦呢！ <a href="#c100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>

<p>— 程小靑著</p>
<p>第九章　驚人消息</p>
<p>金梅抗辯說：「先生，我並不曾隱藏什麽啊。我所知道的都已吿訴你們。若說余少爺的事，我也並不是要袒護他。他有罪沒有罪，你們總查得明白。我的話——」</p>
<p>我阻止伊說：「金梅，你別賣弄你的嘴。你須明白，這是一件人命案子。你如果在兇案上並沒份，却因着少數金錢或其他關係，想掩護什麽人，那你就會把災禍弄到你自己身上來。我給你想想。白白地爲了人家吃苦受罪，眞犯不着。金梅，這是我好意的忠告，你要明白才好。」</p>
<p>我這幾句話本來沒有什麽威脅的意味，可是處產生了意外的效果。伊向我凝視了幾秒鐘，伊的眼腔裏有些水在在的樣子。伊的答話時候，聲音也有些哽咽了。</p>
<p>伊說道：「先生，我懂得，這是你的好意。不過我因着余少爺平日待我很好，此番的事，他的行動的確有些可疑，我才——才想幫幫他的忙。現在我可以老實說，他在昨天早晨曾在電話中跟王小姐吵嘴，昨天夜裏這兇案發生以後，他也曾到大門外來探望，我曾給他一個暗號，叫他走開——」</p>
<p>我又阻截伊說：「關於他的事，我們已都知道，你不必再說。除他以外，你可還袒護着什麽別的人？」</p>
<p>金梅抬起頭來答道：「沒有啊，還有什麽人？」</p>
<p>我道：一譬如李老爺的兒子李守琦，前天從蘇州來，在道裏住過一夜，你也絕不會說起。」</p>
<p>伊忽張大了含着淚珠的眼睛，驚駭地說：「唉—他—」伊略頓一頓，繼續說：「先住，關於他的事，你們自己不會問過我啊。我爲什麽要幫他？我跟他本來是小相識的，你們不曾提起他，我爲着李老爺的面子起見，自然也不敢亂說。因爲這回事關係很大。我當然不願意把是非找上自己身上來。先生，你別誤會，我決不是故意袒護他。」</p>
<p>我心中暗暗歡喜，聽金梅的語氣，料想關於道李守琦的故事，一定也有些動人的成份；並且在現在的局勢之下，要伊說出這番我急於要知道的故事，也一定不會有多大的困難了。　（一四四）</p>

<h3 id="c102">生丑行中典型人物　故都梨園之四老 <a href="#c102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— 病鳩</p>
<p>時慧寳，尙和玉，程繼仙，蕭長華四伶工，垂暮之年，猶欲粉墨登塲，故都梨園，號稱四老，今春嘗組老人班出演平津，終以賣座欠佳，不久卽吿輟演。長江前浪推後浪，人老珠黃不値錢，新陳代謝，乃信年華之殘酷，因悲興感，不可無記。</p>
<p>時慧寳</p>
<p>爲孫派老生之碩果僅存者，孫派學者有三人，白文奎　克庭名皆不逮智儂，智儂早年嗓音甚亮，大氣磅礴，渾厚無倫，得孫派直往直來之致，不守規矩，隨心所欲，咬字則較孫氏爲準，不雜土音，身段風雅洒脫，亦較乃師漂亮，年前來申，愚會觀其「上天台」一劇，台步工穩，身上好看，典型宛在，幾不信其爲花甲外人。唱工終以年齡關係，嗓音不够，哀氣大弱，似有力不從心之苦，一代藝人，難免衰老，孫派將隨此人絕矣。</p>
<p>尙和玉</p>
<p>藝宗兪菊笙，聲名雖不逮小樓，以技藝論，二人實互有短長。「長板坡」「挑滑車」等劇，和玉扼於嗓，困於扮相，固不能比擬小樓，而和王學力精到，武工卓絕，「四平山」「神亭嶺」等戲，豈小樓所能望其項背。他如「拿高登」「鐵籠山」等開臉戲，從容穩練，具先淮規範，亦可與小樓媲美，和玉品格道德，俱極高尙，生性沈靜，不輕言笑，自奉甚儉，與世無爭，早年久居李吉瑞下，名爲所抑，黃鐘毀棄，瓦缶電鳴，時人爲之叫屈。晚年英姿颯颯，威武猶昔，客春小樓作古，受人慫恿，曾組班出演故都，豈眞欲東山再起歟？要亦環境使然也。</p>
<p>程繼仙</p>
<p>爲大老板程長庚之嫡孫，小榮春科班出身，梨園世家也，尊爲今日小生首座，已無異議。其藝事文武皆全，唱做咸能，稱爲爐火純靑，最爲恰當。惜老運次佳，自離秋聲社後，生活頓起問題，後雖一度搭尙和玉班，嗓已衰疲，不爲人重，而身手穩健，字眼分明，典型固仍在也。生性固執，不隨俗流，曾有人的其演「借東風」之周瑜，彼僅演至打蓋卽止，蓋老路「羣英會」不帶借風也，其態度倔强，可見一斑。</p>
<p>蕭長華</p>
<p>爲現代丑行典型，舉凡後進丑角，靡不尊爲宗師，其藝已臻化境，文丑允稱絕活。「羣英會」之蔣幹，有活子翼之譽，盜書時身段神情，刻劃入微，嘆爲觀止。「刺湯」之湯勤，狀小人輕佻狀態，維妙維肖，且皆能雅不傷俗，富有書卷氣，斯可貴也。單挑戲如「請醫」「連陞店」「絨花計」，與人配演如「小上墳」「打刀」「狀元譜」「法門寺」等，亦無不生色，蕭生性亢直，誨人不倦，富社倚爲左右手，亦現代僅存之藝人也。</p>
<h3 id="c103">從杜十娘說起　漱六女史 <a href="#c103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>我看了陳燕燕主演的「杜十娘」以後，很是感動。杜十娘雖是妓女，待李甲却是一片誠心，不棄貧賤，願與李用做生死夫妻，但李甲却沒有主意，不能識人，爲了怕嚴父譴責，竟貪一千兩的身價把杜十娘賣給他們的敵人孫富。杜十娘就一氣投江而死。死前曾說過道樣的話：「我有幾十萬珍珠飾寳，現在都拋在江裏了；但我的心，也許比幾十萬珍珠寳飾還要寳貴。」是的，愛情是最寳貴的。李甲倘若眞的愛十娘，應該刻苦衝破一切的難關。怕父親譴責，難道就不能自謀出道，一定要做倚賴者麽？照電影上所說，他的千金，這賣妻的血錢，被劫以後，不是還可以賣字爲活麽？雖與乞丐相差無幾，到底總還偷生的活着了呀。</p>
<p>中國人注重貞操觀念，夫妻結合以後極少離婚，每爲歐美人所佩服，不像歐美人那據的愛情不能持久。熊式一的「王寳釧」之能轟動，就是爲了王寳釧能過十八年苦生活，不改其志。我希望結過婚或正在戀愛的人們，彼此要親愛諒解，永遠鞏固夫妻間的愛情。</p>
<p>編劇者恐怕觀衆失望，所以特地讓十娘被救活終於團圓。「願天下有情人都成眷屬」，這立意也是極好的。（却酬）</p>

<p>— 伯奮</p>
<p>假使我間你：「影迷之王是誰」？你能回答嗎？如果不能，那我可以來吿訴你：影迷之王是紐約哥倫比亞大學電影研究科的一位女學生佛吉妮克洛特（Virglnia　Clond）女士。</p>
<p>克洛特女十的獲得「影迷之王」這頭銜決不是件徼悻之事，她每年耗掉美金二五〇元來看電影，七八年來從不曾間斷，什麽影片都看，A級片好，B級片也好，C級片（新聞片及短片）也常看，年復一年，到現在她已是全美觀影的冠軍了。</p>
<p>這位影迷之王有個怪癖，她接連坐在影院裹十幾小時，從不會疲倦，他平常每天看五部影片，早晨二部，飯後一部，晚上再看二部，而每星期六她專門看新聞片和短片。</p>
<p>她的家就住在紐約百老滙一一〇號Nemo電影院隔壁，近水樓臺，所以她每天光顧這家影院。</p>
<p>這位影迷之王在看過的千百張影片中，認爲「亂世佳人」和法蘭克勞埃導演的“Cavalcade”是最滿意的二張。在最近一年來看到的影片中，「百刦英雄」，「幼年安迪生」，一蝴蝶夢」，「民族精神」四張是難以使人忘懐的作品。</p>
<p>她反對高爾溫最近向影界發表的「反對雙片開映制宣言」</p>
<p>保羅茂尼，史賓塞厥賽和費雯麗是這位影迷之王最崇拜的影星。</p>

<p>Rangoon, officials of the Southwest Transportation Administration of China announced today that several bridges on the Burma Road within Chinese territory have been bombed and destroyed by Japanese aircraft. However, Chinese engineering teams can construct temporary bridges within 48 hours to replace them. It is said that the Chinese repair work is very rapid, so there is no long-term fear of Japanese bombing. The Yunnan-Burma Road is like the Guangdong-Hankou Railway of the past, and daily transportation can continue uninterrupted because it has never failed to be repaired on the same day after being bombed by Japanese aircraft. (22nd, United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo, the Japanese military authorities announced here today that Japanese bombers bombed important bridges along the Yunnan-Burma Road yesterday, and several targets suffered significant damage.

<h3 id="e6">The Failure of Japanese Army's Attempt at Mobile Warfare in Western Zhejiang; The Chinese Army Seizes the Initiative; The Recovery of Zhuji County: A Detailed Account <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>A certain place in eastern Zhejiang, the Japanese army in western Zhejiang attempted to carry out mobile warfare, but the Chinese army seized the initiative and struck at them, and their attempt was crushed. The situation has returned to what it was eight days ago. According to military experts here, the Japanese army began to move on the evening of the 8th, and on the morning of the 9th, the Japanese army in Yuhang invaded Lin'an. The Chinese army launched a counterattack and recovered Lin'an on the morning of the 10th. At the same time, the Japanese troops in Fuyang, Wukang, Changxing, and Wuxing also moved in different directions. The Japanese forces in Fuyang attacked Xindeng, but the Chinese army bravely blocked and attacked them, and the Japanese army did not succeed, crossing the Fuchun River to attack Zhaixi. The Japanese troops in Wukang arrived at Xiaofeng in Anji on the 10th and retreated north to Si'an under pressure from the Chinese army. The Japanese troops in Wuxing opened Si'an on the 10th and, after joining the Japanese troops in Anji Xiaofeng on the 11th, advanced toward Guangde. The Chinese army launched a fierce siege and retreated north to Liyang. At the same time, the Japanese troops in Fuyang also crossed the river from Fuyang, advanced toward Dazhen, and continued to flow southeast, arriving at Yingdian Street on the 15th and fighting fiercely with the Chinese army for three days and three nights. The Japanese forces resumed reinforcements and launched a fierce attack, arriving in the northwest area of Zhuji on the 17th, with a part disturbing Caota Temple. They entered Zhuji on the evening of the 18th, finding nothing but emptiness, realizing they had fallen into a dead end. It was too late. The Chinese army seized the opportunity and immediately launched a siege on the Japanese forces, rushing toward the Japanese army in the city, resulting in fierce street fighting. By about 8 AM on the morning of the 19th, the Japanese broke through and retreated to Linpu. The Chinese army completely recovered Zhuji City at 9 AM on the morning of the 19th. At present, it is surrounding more than a thousand remaining Japanese troops in the northeast area of Zhuji and pursuing them, having recaptured Jianshan and attacking Linpu. (21st Dispatch)</p>

<p>A certain place in eastern Zhejiang, after the Japanese troops attacking Zhuji were defeated by the Chinese forces, they felt threatened because their rear was cut off. On the evening of the 20th, they gathered the remaining troops and advanced south along the Puyang River, launching a counterattack on Zhuji City. The Chinese army ambushed them along the way, inflicting heavy damage on the Japanese. At midnight on the 21st, the Japanese arrived at the outskirts of the city. The Chinese army launched a counterattack with all its might, encircling the Japanese troops on the outskirts of Zhuji and inflicting another painful blow. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties and broke through and retreated north at 11 AM on the morning of the 22nd. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue, killing countless more. As of the time of dispatch, the vanguard of the Chinese army has crossed the Sanjiangkou and is continuing to track and pursue them fiercely. (22nd Dispatch)</p>

<p>Chongqing, regarding the rumor of Britain sending a military mission to China, there is no news here. Informed sources believe that this mission is not necessary at present because Japan is unlikely to take drastic action against Britain and the United States in the Far East in the near future. Chinese sources believe that Japan may limit its activities to air raids on the Burma Road and strengthen its position in Vietnam. Although Japan is currently engaging in intimidation, economic reasons alone have put Japan in a position where it cannot go to war with Britain and the United States in the Pacific. The British military mission to China will only be necessary if Japan decides to advance into Burma to capture Singapore. (22nd, Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e14">Turkey's Movements Amidst the Global Situation <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>In yesterday's commentary on recent international developments, it was mentioned that Turkey is one of the problematic countries in the current World War. Today, we will focus on Turkey and attempt to elaborate. The two opposing international camps will see a significant shift in the overall situation due to Turkey's decision on its alliances and enemies. Therefore, the impact is far-reaching and becomes an international problem. The main implications of this problem are: (1) Germany and Italy have already launched their eastward advance. Turkey's response to this will directly affect the success or failure of Germany and Italy's efforts to dismantle the British Empire by land and their plans to dominate British colonies in Asia and Africa. (2) Britain has its own plans for the Near East. What attitude will Turkey take towards these plans? This is enough to determine the entire Near East situation. At the same time, it will have a significant impact on Britain's overall military deployment. (3) Turkey and the Soviet Union are intensifying their diplomatic negotiations. The content and outcome of these negotiations are currently unknown. However, they have the potential to drive the entire international situation forward.</p>
<p>Looking back at the European situation over the past year, the changes have been drastic. From a geographical bird's-eye view, from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Black Sea in the east, from the North Sea and the Baltic Sea in the north to the Mediterranean Sea in the south, with the exception of the Soviet Union's expanding influence, almost the entire European continent has successively fallen under the control of Germany and Italy. From an international perspective, the so-called "Central Europe," "Eastern Europe," and "Balkans" groups have all disappeared one after another. A year ago, Turkey, because it straddles Europe and Asia and because of the international disputes over the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus Straits, was often at risk of being drawn into the vortex of international politics. However, Turkey was able to use the shield of the so-called "Balkan Pact" to deal with the situation in many ways and stay out of the turmoil in Europe. Now, this favorable environment no longer exists. Its northern neighbor, Romania, has recently joined the embrace of Germany and Italy. Therefore, Turkey now borders Germany and Italy on the Black Sea. To its west, across a narrow strip of land including Bulgaria and Greece, it can now remotely observe the surging power of Germany and Italy. In short, in Europe, because of the gradual annexation of this area, the situation is becoming simpler, and it is seeing the three major powers of Germany and Italy, the Soviet Union, and Britain competing with each other, with smaller countries being swept away, leaving Turkey with no room to form alliances for self-preservation. From now on, all developments in the European situation will become events that affect Turkey's interests and rise and fall, making it impossible for it to dodge as before and not allowing it to stand idly by.</p>
<p>From the European situation, the possibility of Germany and Italy winning the air and sea war against Britain in the short term is impossible. This is what is now called the lightning strategy against Britain. There is no hope of success for now. The only remaining way for Germany to attack Britain is by land: in Asia, using the Italian protectorate of Yemen and the French mandate of Syria as bases; in Africa, using Italian Somaliland and Abyssinia as bases. In this way, the two sides will echo each other and advance together, first seeking to control the Red Sea and then slowly expanding. In Asia, they would advance from the Arabian Peninsula, through Iran, Afghanistan, and Balochistan, to invade India. In Africa, they would first pass through Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, Egypt, and French West Africa, forming a single entity, and then move south, directly towards the British South African Union. There have been various signs of Germany and Italy's land invasion plan recently, and Germany's control of Romania, its oppression of Bulgaria and Greece, and Italy's occupation of British Somaliland are the beginning of its advancement plan. As for whether the plan can be realized, it depends on Britain's resistance and Turkey's attitude.</p>
<p>Britain must have anticipated Germany and Italy's plan long ago. Long before the outbreak of the European war last year, Britain had preemptively guaranteed the safety of Romania and Greece. Further, it established alliances with Poland and Turkey. Britain's intention was to create a situation in Eastern and Southern Europe where Germany would have to fight on two fronts, east and west. At the very least, it could block Germany's land route to dismantle the British Empire. A year has passed, Poland has been conquered, and Romania has taken an extremely anti-British stance. Under the encirclement of Germany and Italy, Greece cannot resist Germany and Italy's advance unless Britain sends troops to help it resist directly. In short, among the allied countries that Britain wooed a year ago in this area, only Turkey remains. Therefore, in the past few months, it has intensified its efforts to remedy the situation from both sides: on the one hand, deploying the navy to various ports in the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea and increasing defenses in Africa and the Near East with a large number of land troops from India and other places; on the other hand, intensifying diplomatic activities in this area, attempting to form a group in the Near East and Africa after the collapse of the front in Southeastern Europe. Countries such as Egypt, the Kingdom of Nejd, Iraq, and Iran are all on the list. Britain is of course the leader of the group, and Turkey is a powerful key player. Recently, Eden's trip to Africa and the Near East was for this mission. If Turkey and Nejd can both agree to Britain's plan, then Britain's military burden in this area can be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>The objects of Britain's attempts are not entirely under Britain's control. However, considering the Soviet Union's attitude in the meantime, the situation can be seen to be very subtle. Up until now, the international divisions that are already evident in this area are roughly: (1) There is a very close relationship between the Soviet Union and Turkey because Turkey, although not a socialist country, is a barrier for the socialist world and is one of the Soviet Union's most reliable allies. Turkey also considers the Soviet Union to be the most reliable ally of smaller ethnic groups in resisting powerful neighbors. (2) Britain and Turkey have a mutual assistance agreement. The only exception to the agreement is that Turkey is released from its obligation to Britain when the Soviet Union objects. (3) There is a non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany, but the pact will immediately become invalid if war breaks out between Germany and Turkey. Therefore, on the German and Italian side, it is best to avoid provoking Turkey as much as possible; on the British side, it is best to pull Turkey into joint combat; and for Turkey itself, although the situation no longer allows it to remain detached, the biggest and most difficult problem is how to consider the gains and losses and weigh the pros and cons in order to protect its own interests.</p>
<p>The diplomatic negotiations between the Soviet Union and Turkey, which are intensifying recently, will, regardless of their content or outcome, have a direct impact on Turkey's attitude to some extent. Taking a broader view, all these brewing and trends will still shift depending on the diplomacy separately conducted by the Soviet Union with Britain and the United States, and by the Soviet Union with Germany, Italy, and Japan. What is worth noting is the Soviet Union's basic strategy for the entire international situation, its understanding of the fundamental nature of the current European war, and its perception of the difference in the degree to which the outcome of the Anglo-German war will affect the Soviet Union's safety.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Britain and the United States Discuss Concrete Cooperation to Protect Their Pacific Interests; The United States' Total Oil Embargo on Japan Will Depend on the Outcome of Japan-Netherlands Negotiations <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Washington, regarding the matter of Japan now seeking to obtain an oil supply from the Dutch East Indies, there is no definite information in official circles here. However, the fact that Japan will send Kobayashi back to his country from Batavia shows that the rumored agreement between Japan and the Dutch East Indies, which would allow Japan to obtain one-fourth of its annual oil needs from the Dutch East Indies, has not been signed and that obstacles have arisen in the negotiations. According to sources here, British Ambassador to the United States Lord Lothian's return to Britain to report on his duties will not only involve discussing the situation within the United States but also discussing the interests and status of Britain and the United States in the Pacific. The issue of oil and other raw materials from the Dutch East Indies will also be discussed. Some political observers believe that President Roosevelt's Pacific policy is now more rigid than before and that he will take other steps after the election. Some newspapers believe that the claim that Lothian will remain in London until after the election has significant meaning, implying that Lothian will bring the British government's views to the United States when new actions develop in the Pacific. Regarding the international efforts to secure the oil supply from the Dutch East Indies, it is difficult to ascertain the true situation. It is regarded here as an unclear matter. When Secretary of State Hull hosted newspaper reporters yesterday, many competed to ask about the situation of the negotiations and the attitude of the United States towards the contract negotiated between the Dutch East Indies oil company and Japan, but Hull did not give a clear answer. Although the Java Oil Company is under Dutch jurisdiction and not subject to American law, it would be surprising if the State Department used this to evade responsibility.

<p>Washington, the implementation of further American economic pressure on Japan will apparently depend on the outcome of Japan's negotiations with the Dutch East Indies regarding Dutch oil. Authoritative sources recently said that the US government is still considering a complete embargo on oil, copper, iron, and steel. (22nd United Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e16">The United States Is Willing to Accept the Challenge; No More Appeasement of Japan; Mr. Bullitt Delivers a Speech <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Washington, Reuters correspondents heard from reliable sources that former US Ambassador to France William Bullitt, who is known as the President's confidant, delivered a clear and unreserved speech in Chicago yesterday with some authority, leaving Japan with no hope that the United States would appease it. Bullitt ignored Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's change of tone after infuriating the United States and paid attention to Japanese Prime Minister Konoe's threat to "open fire." This can be seen as a clear indication that the US authorities are unwilling to be easily relieved by Japan's explanations. As for Konoe's statement that if the United States does not understand Japan, Germany, and Italy's true intentions, there is no other way than to wage war against the United States, the United States is willing to accept it. It is generally expected that Bullitt's words accurately represent the attitude of the US authorities, making it nearly impossible for Japan to obtain an oil supply from the Dutch East Indies. (22nd Reuters Dispatch</p>
<p>Chicago, former US Ambassador to France William Bullitt said last night in a speech to the Foreign Policy Council that if the Axis powers are allowed to win, the United States will have to deal with enemy countries in two oceans. The United States should increase production and arrange national defense based on preparing for war. Bullitt spoke of the British people, saying that men, women, old and young are now being bombed, enduring suffering with a magnificent spirit that makes humanity increase its glory. Although British aircraft are not as numerous as the enemy's, they are still fighting bravely to protect their country and protect us. Bullitt went on to speak of the alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan, pointing to this as a new and delayed action of declaring war on the United States, saying that the United States, impelled by a sense of self-defense, understands that isolation is fine when there are strong allies struggling to maintain world order, but when a country is surrounded by enemies, isolation is the first step to destruction. We do not know when Japan will begin its new and delayed action of declaring war on the United States, but the alliance recently established near Berlin has given us a warning that Germany, Italy, and Japan are trying to invade the United States. Past events in Europe have shown us the unprofitable lesson of pursuing appeasement with dictators. We yield to them, we relax our defenses, and they strike again. The effects of the appeasement policies of Britain, France, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Denmark have been witnessed by our own eyes. What cannot be appeased, we certainly cannot appease. Do we believe that by not helping Britain, we can gain the favor of Germany and Italy? Do we say that the United States should negotiate with Germany and Italy to destroy the British Empire? Do we believe that the United States should not continue to fund China? We all know that it is impossible to negotiate appeasement with the Nazis, the Fascists, or the Japanese militarists. We know that other countries have done so before, and we do not want to repeat their mistakes. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Washington, the Navy Department declared here last night that the news that the US Navy is now storing a large number of submarine parts in Hong Kong is not surprising. They said that the US Navy has been storing submarine parts in Hong Kong for several years because these parts are easier to transport when the US Far East Fleet is in the northern waters than transporting them to Manila. A Navy Department spokesperson also said that US submarines visit Hong Kong from time to time, so the fact that submarine parts are stored in Hong Kong is a normal phenomenon and is not surprising.

<p>Tokyo, "Kokumin Shimbun" reported this morning that, given the past cooperation between Britain and the United States in the Pacific to overturn the Tripartite Pact, the current cabinet must be changed. The return of Kobayashi, the special envoy to the Dutch East Indies, from Batavia to Japan is related to the cabinet's impending reorganization. There were already predictions earlier this month that the Japanese cabinet would be reorganized. Although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that Kobayashi had decided to return to Tokyo to celebrate the Empire Memorial Day and to discuss matters related to the Dutch East Indies, Cabinet Secretary Tomita said that Kobayashi was ordered to return home.

<p>Tokyo, "Kokumin Shimbun" reported today that Prime Minister Konoe will reorganize the Japanese government in the near future, with the aim of forming a strong wartime cabinet. The newspaper, which usually reflects the opinions of the Japanese military, stated that the purpose of the new cabinet is to "cope with the unprecedentedly tense situation in the Pacific." The newspaper stated that Prime Minister Konoe may reshuffle several cabinet members in early November. The newspaper further stated that Japan's determination to establish a "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" has been strengthened by the "interference" of Britain and the United States. Britain's reopening of the滇緬 highway and "unmasked threats to Japan's lifeline" have strengthened Japan's determination to push forward its southward advance. The newspaper continued, saying that the international situation in the Pacific has become more tense due to Germany's preparations for a general offensive against Britain, reports of the United States leasing Singapore's naval port to Britain, and plans for joint British-American defense of the Dutch East Indies. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo, "Asahi Shimbun" reported today that Germany, Italy, and Japan have virtually completed their plan to establish a joint technical committee, "putting the promises of the Tripartite Pact into action."

The ambassadors of Germany, Italy, and Japan will serve as senior members of each committee. The newspaper stated that committees will be established in both Berlin and Tokyo, and the results of ongoing talks may lead to the simultaneous establishment of a committee in Rome.

<p>Manila, Admiral Hart, Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, announced here today that the families of all US Navy personnel in the Far East, including those in the Philippines, will be evacuated. Admiral Hart said that this evacuation will take a considerable amount of time due to the shortage of merchant ships in the Far East. Admiral Hart stated that the evacuation of personnel from the Philippines is not due to any special developments. The Navy Department cannot discriminate against personnel stationed in various parts of the Far East. According to statistics, there are 1,000 naval dependents in the Philippines. Some people believe that this evacuation decision is the result of naval personnel spending too much time on overseas patrols. Admiral Hart said that the cost of evacuating naval families will be borne by the government. A US military spokesman here said that the families of army personnel currently stationed in the Philippines will not be evacuated. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>Singapore, the Straits Times' Batavia correspondent revealed today that Japan and the Netherlands recently signed a memorandum in Batavia, stating that Japan does not consider the Dutch East Indies to be within the "New Order in East Asia" sphere. According to the correspondent, after the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact, the Dutch authorities believed that without Japan's guarantee to maintain the status quo of the Dutch East Indies, there would be serious obstacles to continuing Japanese-Dutch negotiations. Therefore, they requested the Japanese side to sign this clause. As a result, Japan will also be able to obtain 100,000 tons of salt from the Dutch East Indies within the next three years. At the same time, Nakahara, a naval commissioner of the Japanese-Dutch East Indies delegation, arrived here by plane today and then proceeded to Hanoi via Saigon.

<p>Batavia, the only practical progress made in the negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies so far is that the oil companies in the question have proposed that in the next few months, they will sell some oil and oil products to Japan according to strict commercial procedures, but without signing any contracts. It is heard that the Japanese side has accepted this proposal as the basis for negotiations, and it is now being discussed by the Japanese side and the oil companies.

The Dutch East Indies government has repeatedly and solemnly stated that it is willing to strictly limit these negotiations to the economic sphere and maintain its policy of non-discrimination and good neighborliness.

<p>British Secretary of War to Transfer to Ankara</p>
<p>Ankara, it has recently been learned from sources close to the British Embassy here that British Secretary of War Eden will arrive here in the coming days. It is widely believed that after Eden arrives here, he will participate in the British-Turkish negotiations currently being conducted here by British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen and Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu in his capacity as Secretary of War. However, based on the situation in all parties here, it is feared that these negotiations may not achieve the expected results. Regarding military issues in the negotiations, senior British military officers arrived here yesterday from Palestine and will present them for discussion. Turkish political figures are closely watching the development of the negotiations, but the general public is mostly apprehensive. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>Southern Countries Undergoing Severe Pressure</p>
<p>London, the conclusion of a new commercial treaty between Germany and Southern Countries seems to indicate that Germany has initially tested its edge, intending to increase its influence in Southern Countries. Southern Countries now clearly feel the double pressure of Germany and Italy and are trying to make timely concessions to avoid suffering the fate of Romania. However, whether the policy of compromise pursued by Southern Countries can obtain more satisfactory results than other countries that have already pursued a policy of compromise is by no means certain. The path that German strategy must follow is to first make commercial demands, then political and military demands, until the entire country is in the hands of the German secret police. The progress of the strategy may be fast or slow, but the results are rarely different from this. As far as Southern Countries are concerned, Italy has territorial ambitions towards Southern Countries, and these ambitions may soon be exposed. Anti-Italian sentiment in Southern Countries is particularly strong, and the disregard for Italian military force is also very common. Therefore, if the current German policy of squeezing Southern Countries is launched solely by Mussolini, Italy may not easily break Southern Countries' resistance. Southern Countries are now only playing the first act in this drama. Southern Countries are small and weak countries, and the wounds suffered in the last war have not yet healed. It is natural that they cannot fight against the two powerful neighbors of Germany and Italy. Although the Southern Countries and the Soviet Union have recently become closer again, the Soviet Union is further away. The situation in Bulgaria and Greece is still unclear. It can now be confirmed that thousands of so-called tourists have entered Bulgaria, but the rumor that the Axis powers have made demands on Bulgaria and Greece has not been confirmed.

Political figures here pointed out that the rumors that British Secretary of War Eden will come to Athens for a visit are purely unfounded, but it can be definitively pointed out that the Greek Minister to Turkey has maintained contact with British diplomats stationed in various Balkan countries in Istanbul.

<p>Capital of Southern Countries, the British Embassy here announced that British Minister to Southern Countries Campbell departed for Istanbul on the night of the 20th "to take care of personal affairs."

Well-informed sources here commented that it is difficult to say for sure what Campbell's purpose is. Regarding the foreign policy of the Yugoslav government, Foreign Minister Marković had clearly elaborated on it when signing the German-Southern Countries commercial agreement. Marković said that the friendly understanding between Germany and Southern Countries has not only produced good results in the economic sphere, but has also completed cooperation in the political sphere. From this, it can be seen that Southern Countries has decided to unite with the Axis countries. Any policy that endangers the Balkans will be opposed by Southern Countries. Therefore, Britain's planned activities in the Balkans will encounter significant resistance from Southern Countries. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Capital of Southern Countries, authoritative sources here yesterday confirmed that Romania has requested Yugoslavia to extradite Barisianu, the head of the Bucharest police who escaped into Southern Countries. It is said that Barisianu is a major suspect in the assassination of Codreanu, the former leader of the Romanian Iron Guard, but Barisianu's whereabouts in Southern Countries are still unknown. The Yugoslav government is currently studying whether the crime committed by Barisianu is political or criminal in nature. If it is political, Yugoslavia will not agree to extradition.

<p>Budapest, according to unconfirmed reports arriving here today, the Soviet Union and Turkey are preparing to sign a non-aggression treaty, with both countries agreeing to mutual assistance, provided that Turkey does not get involved in future Balkan conflicts. It is widely believed that this rumored treaty is a kind of assistance from Moscow to Germany and Italy, as both Germany and Italy hope that Turkey will maintain its neutrality when the Axis powers attack Greece. According to this news, it arrived here after a day of absolutely contradictory rumors from various Balkan capitals. (National News Service dispatch, 22nd)</p>

It is said that the Soviet protest stated that Germany's occupation of Romania was a violation of the German-Soviet agreement regarding Romania. It is heard that this agreement only allows Germany to promote economic cooperation in Romania.

<p>London: According to official announcements, on Monday, British bombers again conducted extensive operations in Germany and German-occupied areas. Enemy escort fleets were also attacked by British aircraft, one of which was hit and unable to move. Although the weather was not very good last night, British aircraft still fiercely attacked Hamburg's docks. Multiple hits caused fires and explosions. Other targets, such as oil depots, factories, and airfields, were also bombed by British aircraft. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>London: This morning, British long-range artillery positions fired on the German-occupied coast for the third consecutive day, shaking the Dover area. Due to dense fog, targets were difficult to see. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>London: It was revealed here today that the Royal Air Force carried out two air raids on Berlin before dawn yesterday. It was also stated that since the beginning of September, the Royal Air Force has carried out 14 air raids on Berlin. No fewer than 225 British bombers participated in the two pre-dawn raids, dropping more than 200 tons of bombs on Berlin. This announcement was issued by British officials after the Royal Air Force attacked Berlin, other parts of Germany and German-occupied areas, and several important military targets in northern Italy on Sunday night and early yesterday morning. Londoners generally believe that the Royal Air Force's heavy blow to the German invasion bases in England on Sunday night and early Monday morning may have once again shattered the German invasion attempt. Since the Royal Air Force's timely bombing defeated the German's first invasion attempt on September 16, the German-occupied Channel ports suffered their most severe bombing on Sunday night. (International Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>British Planes Cross the Alps and Bomb the Heart of Italy</p>
<p>London: On the night of the 11th, the Royal Air Force operated at both ends and in the center of the Berlin-Rome axis. In addition to attacking Berlin twice for more than six hours, it also bombed Italian automobile and aircraft factories and steel plants with high-explosive bombs. The first batch of British aircraft attacking Berlin encountered dense fog on the ground and circled in the air for half an hour to find their targets. When the fog dissipated, they identified the railway yard by moonlight and dropped high-explosive bombs, hitting the railway sidings. Incendiary bombs caused five fires. The British aircraft that arrived later paid attention to the objectives near the city center and the industrial area in the northwest suburbs. Bombs were also seen exploding all around. Two hours later, British aircraft began their second attack on Berlin. At that time, the visibility was clear, which was conducive to the attack. A British plane, regardless of the intense anti-aircraft fire, descended rapidly to within 2,000 feet of the ground and dropped a batch of bombs on the city center, instantly causing a major fire. Prischai Street, Ote Railway Yard, and the railway siding in Charlottenburg were all hit by British bombs. British aircraft attacking Italy had to cross the Alps twice, making a non-stop flight of 1,600 miles. Shortly after midnight, British aircraft began active operations in Italy, bombing factories in Milan, the Machine Xia Te factory in Turin, the Bierelli factory in Hans Tusang Zhuofan Ni, and the Austrian steel plant. In addition to operating at both ends of the German-Italian axis, the Central Aircraft also attacked various ports and industrial targets in the Ruhr area, such as the Krupp factory, the naval docks in Hamburg and Wilhelmshaven, etc. The communiqué stated that the docks were heavily bombed and it was believed that a giant enemy ship was hit. Two oil refineries near Cologne were set ablaze. The aluminum plant in Rouen was also fiercely attacked, and the Glay Bu Kang Bai Leck factory was attacked for 90 minutes. Multiple buildings were hit by bombs and exploded with a roar, and flames shot into the sky. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Liverpool and the Midlands Heavily Attacked by German Aircraft</p>
<p>London: Early this morning, German aircraft launched a short, intense aerial blitz on London, dropping high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs on the city, before turning to the Midlands area of Liverpool for the most intense attack. It is reported that several bombs exploded near the residence of the American Ambassador to London, Mr. Geng Nadi, who escaped unharmed. The British censorship office does not allow the details of this matter to be published, only stating that Mr. Geng was not injured. Liverpool was heavily attacked by German aircraft, which dropped hundreds of high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs. Many places in the city caught fire, and many towns along the River Mersey were subjected to unprecedented air raids. The German air raid on London stopped relatively early, allowing London residents a temporary respite and great comfort. Because the German air raid on London was so short, various parties here believe that London's night air defenses are becoming increasingly effective. (International Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>London: Last night and this morning, German aircraft again engaged in extensive air raids over the British Isles, on a smaller scale but with greater intensity. The attack on London eased several hours after the first air raid alarm sounded, apparently due to heavy fog obstructing visibility. The attacking aircraft, under the cover of low-hanging fog at the beginning of the night, managed to fly across the darkened sky, break through the anti-aircraft fire net, and invade the northwest of England. Late at night, the clouds dissipated and the air cleared, and the German aircraft flying over London were clearly visible. The anti-aircraft guns around London frequently fired at the passing German aircraft. At night, multiple bombs fell on a town in the Midlands, while few bombs fell in the London area. It was reported that the attackers attacked northeastern England at 9:50 p.m. Yesterday afternoon, a German plane dropped more than ten bombs on a town in the south, injuring eight people, three seriously. A church was bombed, and fortunately 250 primary school students were not far from the church when the bomb fell and were not injured. It is also said to be fortunate. During the daytime air raid, six districts of London were bombed. At that time, several German aircraft dared to fly under low clouds to invade the British capital. According to official announcements, in order to prevent overcrowding in London's air-raid shelters and areas for receiving evacuated London residents during night raids, the government has taken steps to deal with the situation. It is heard that from now on, people must enter air-raid shelters with admission tickets issued by the authorities, and the authorities managing reception areas are also ordered to implement compulsory licensing measures and evacuate the necessary houses in order to accommodate people. Yesterday, in addition to northwestern England being invaded by German aircraft, Liverpool, a town in Wales, and a town in southwestern England were also visited by German aircraft, indicating that last night's raid was quite extensive. In the London area, three bombs damaged countless houses and huts, and broke a water pipe. A doctor, in the midst of his busy schedule, even amputated the leg of a wounded person in an open-air field, which is another page in the tragic history of air raids. In a working-class area in a town in the northwest of the interior, many houses were bombed, and four people were killed. There were also single German aircraft wreaking havoc in the southwest and northwest, causing some deaths and injuries. In a town on the south coast, four workers were killed. In a town in the northwest, many workers were killed or injured while being forced to flee to air-raid shelters. In the London area, anti-aircraft guns began operating at 5 p.m., before the air raid alarm sounded. The reporter saw a wisp of black smoke in the sky, which must have been a German aircraft that was hit and burned. In Kensington, the famous historical building that Cromwell often visited, "Holland House," was also damaged by bombs. The mansion was built in 1617 for Walter Gobe, Duke, and became a famous social and academic center in London for hundreds of years. Also, in the air raid yesterday morning, an apartment and several of its buildings were also severely damaged. (United Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>London: According to a communiqué issued by the Ministry of Aviation, the German aircraft's bombing last night mainly focused on the Midlands, London, and Moser Satt. After it ended early this morning, there was a slight intermittent activity. A town in the Midlands and stores and houses were damaged. The fire that started was controlled by the air defense team, and several people were killed or injured. In the London area, houses, shops, and factories were damaged, and several people were killed or injured. In a town in Moser Satt, most of the damage was to houses, and the fires caused by incendiary bombs were also controlled and extinguished. Several people were killed or injured. In a town in the northeast, many houses were damaged and several people were injured, but the damage caused by bombs was minimal and there were few deaths or injuries in other towns in southeastern England and in the Midlands, South Wales. The initial attack on London was quite fierce, but bombs fell in only a few areas. Most of the planes were subsequently driven away, with only a few disturbing the fog all night. The number of German aircraft appearing in the skies of the capital yesterday was less than usual. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>London: Strong British night fighters and newly arrived high-speed American aircraft demonstrated their power last night and this morning to defend against the Nazi iron birds harassing London. Multiple British fighter planes and subsequent American reinforcements engaged in fierce battles with groups of German bombers over a certain area, and the sounds of fierce fighting could be heard clearly.

<p>Rome: According to the Italian military headquarters last night, the Italian Air Force dropped more than 150 giant bombs when attacking Bahrain Island in the Persian Gulf. According to reports from Air Force personnel participating in the operation, the island's new oil refinery, oil pools, and oil pipelines were severely damaged.

Machine rooms were destroyed in aircraft factories and ordnance factories in Liverpool and North Ryland. Barracks and airfields were also hit. Aircraft parked on the ground were all destroyed. Oil pools and port works were also bombed. A convoy was attacked off the east coast of England, and a merchant ship (3,000 tons) was hit. Large fires occurred in Birmingham, Coventry, and Liverpool last night. Several British speedboats opened fire on German ships, one of which was sunk by the Germans, and the rest retreated. Enemy aircraft flew over German territory last night, and the Germans suffered no losses. Two enemy aircraft and two German aircraft were lost yesterday. (Haitong Telegram, 22nd)</p>

<p>London: The Daily Telegraph stated in today's editorial that Italy's four months of efforts have made our enemies, friends, and neutral people all know that the dominance of the western, central, and eastern Mediterranean is still in the hands of our navy. British Prime Minister Churchill recently stated that we should maintain complete control of the Mediterranean and double the strength of the British fleet in the Mediterranean. This statement is indeed the correct answer to Italy. The British fleet, under the command of Sir Cunningham, has repeatedly swept away enemy traces in the Mediterranean, and the captains of the British ships have repeatedly demonstrated their divine prowess. The advantages that the Italian Mussolini relied on due to the Vichy regime's betrayal of Britain are ultimately insufficient to compensate for the weakness of the Italian fleet. The Times also published an editorial stating that the British Navy is now tightly holding the enemy's lifeline. British merchant ships can be found on all major sea routes in the world except the Baltic Sea, but enemy ships cannot. The long-propagated plan to defeat England has repeatedly been delayed, and if it is tried now, it will inevitably suffer a disastrous defeat. The reason is that the 20-mile sea surface defended by the British Navy is an unbreakable obstacle, and its strength is far beyond what the Maginot Line can achieve. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e38">The United States Accelerates the Great Shipbuilding Program; Many Ships Can Be Completed Early Next Year <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Washington: The US Navy has ordered all private and government shipyards to promote an accelerated shipbuilding system, so that the time required to build warships can be reduced by 12%. The US Navy announced today that the latest aircraft carrier, "Hornet No. 1," will be launched in Newport News, Virginia, on December 10. After this announcement was issued, the accelerated shipbuilding order was subsequently disclosed. After a confidential investigation of shipbuilding, it was learned that the ships currently under construction will all be launched earlier than the stipulated time. Among the ships scheduled to be launched in 1941, there are two battleships and three large cruisers. Under the two-ocean navy program, only six battleships have been laid down, and about nine more are scheduled to be built, but construction has not yet begun. The battleships "South Dakota" and "Indiana" were scheduled to be launched in the most recent September. The keels of these two ships were laid too late last year. After each ship is launched, much important work still needs to be done. Therefore, the US Navy has implemented an accelerated system. As a result, the 35,000-ton "North Carolina" and "Washington," which were launched earlier this year, will be ready for service sometime in the fall of next year. According to the survey, the cruisers Atlanta V Ta No. 1 and Juno San Diego No., which began construction this year, will be launched next year. Of the 42 submarines ordered at the end of 1938, 34 may be launched next year. Four can be launched this year, and perhaps two more will be launched before October. The US Navy has completed the deployment of seven destroyers, launched seven, and laid six keels this year. There are 170+ ships in the plan. Another ship can be ready for service this year, and 12 can be ready for service next year. According to shipbuilding investigators, the US Navy will build three minesweepers, one repair ship, three naval aircraft ships, one submarine destroyer, and a small squadron of torpedo boats between now and the end of 1941.

<h3 id="e39">US Drafts New Soldiers; Lottery Scheduled; Army Chief Draws First Lottery; President to Deliver Speech <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt yesterday designated October 29 as the "lottery" date to determine the selection of 800,000 military personnel to be compiled into the first batch of new US recruits. The draft headquarters announced last night that President Roosevelt will deliver a brief national address at the start of the lottery. Army Secretary Stimson will draw the first lottery. This move is actually breaking with precedent, as President Wilson was the one who drew the first lottery during the draft in 1917. Before the lottery, each local committee will post a notice assigning a number to each young man registered on Wednesday. If the first number drawn is "two five eight", then each local committee in the country will send a questionnaire to the young man with number two five eight one in the local area. If the young man with number two five eight one has no family burden, then they will be assigned to the first class. If the young man with number two five eight one has a family burden, then the number drawn for the second time will be considered by the authorities. The Washington Star pointed out that there are 16 million young Americans registered, and there is no confusion. The newspaper continued, "The registration of an American strongman is in fact accepting the dictator's challenge to Western democracies." National Director of Military Service Dextra told reporters, "Those who think we are weak and that democracies cannot operate freely will be disappointed today." He also praised "the unanimous cooperation of the nation's youth." (United Press, 22nd)</p>

<p>Washington: The Chinese Embassy announced last night that the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Hu Shi, will leave Washington this week and travel to various cities in the eastern United States, including New York and Boston, to give extensive speeches. The Ambassador will give a speech at the New York Chamber of Commerce on the evening of October 24, entitled "China Continues to Fight." At the same time, Dr. Hu Shi will also give a speech at the New York "Herald Tribune," entitled "Safeguarding Democracy." The speech will first be broadcast nationwide in the United States. On the same day, Dr. Hu Shi will attend the Harvard Alumni Association dinner as a guest of honor. It is recalled here that many famous professors at Harvard University recently sent letters to famous people in the United States, urging the United States to adopt a stronger policy towards Japan. Dr. Hu Shi will also give a public speech at the International Club of Vasa University on October 25. Dr. Hu is an honorary director of the university. On the same day, Dr. Hu will also speak at the New York State School Committee Association.

<p>New York: The famous Chinese writer Dr. Lin Yutang published a letter in the New York Times today, stating that China is a first-class country and should be regarded as a useful ally of Britain and the United States. Lin said that China has been at war with a first-class power for the past three years and has brought it to a standstill, so China has "naturally become a first-class power." He also said that, for this reason, China should especially be regarded as an ally of the United States, and the United States' assistance to China should be carried out with a positive attitude in the future. Lin's letter was sent from Los Angeles on the 14th of last month, at a time when the US government had not yet announced that it would continue to consider loans to China, nor had it revealed the news that 50 American aircraft had set out for Chongqing. Lin continued that a US-Japan war is inevitable. He also pointed out the importance of China's restraint on Japan, so that it cannot concentrate its efforts to seize the interests of French Indochina. Dr. Lin further pointed out that if the US could lend China 250 million US dollars, the latter could order 1,500 bombers, or 750 bombers and 225 fighters. If China could obtain this kind of air power, it would be enough to launch an effective counterattack against Japan. He concluded, "What China needs and what Japan fears most is the United States' full support for China to end the Sino-Japanese War. This action will have a great spiritual impact on both China and Japan." (United Press, 22nd)</p>

<p>According to reliable sources obtained yesterday from foreign sources, British nationals in Shanghai will also prepare to evacuate after the American nationals. However, British officials are currently unwilling to confirm this matter, but they do not deny it either. Although British nationals in China have not received evacuation orders, the British side generally believes that those who have no need to remain in Shanghai should evacuate as soon as possible.</p>
<p>British Nationals Staying in Japan Register</p>
<p>As for British nationals staying in Japan, this port received a telegram from Tokyo yesterday stating that the British Embassy in Japan is currently advising them to leave Japan as soon as possible, as the situation is turbulent and both commercial and living conditions are unstable, so there is no need to stay. Therefore, the British Embassy in Japan has expedited the registration of overseas nationals. However, the attitude adopted by the British side is the same as that of the United States, advising those who are willing to leave Japan to evacuate as soon as possible, which is voluntary rather than forced.</p>
<p>Women and Children in Hong Kong Have Been Evacuated</p>
<p>The evacuation of British women and children from Hong Kong has become a fait accompli. The British authorities have adopted the same attitude in other parts of the Far East where British nationals are located. This is enough to explain the intentions of British officials regarding the situation in the Far East. Moreover, Japanese newspapers have recently combined the terms "Britain" and "America" in their reports, accusing Britain and America of jointly undermining Japan's plans in the Far East, and pointing out that the reopening of the Burma Road is clear evidence of Britain and America's attempt to threaten Japan, which is tantamount to warning the Japanese people that war with the two countries is possible.</p>
<p>Shanghai Commerce Affected</p>
<p>However, the business of some British companies in Shanghai, such as shipping companies, is still very developed. In the past, large commercial firms had too many employees and wanted to cut them, but now that some British people have returned to their country to serve, this is no longer necessary. It is estimated that there are currently 11,000 British nationals in Shanghai, including women and children. British people are involved in all industries in this port. British commercial firms are the backbone of Shanghai's foreign trade. They have been in Shanghai for a hundred years. Once they evacuate, it will be a major blow to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Impecunious American Nationals Have Requested Assistance</p>
<p>Based on the resolution of the joint meeting held on the 21st, the American Chamber of Commerce in this port and the American Nationals Federation sent a telegram to the State Department in Washington yesterday, requesting economic assistance for American nationals who are unable to return to the United States by ship from the Far East, so that they can evacuate. At the same time, they also requested a reduction in travel expenses and freight charges for luggage and furniture.</p>
<p>Postal Shipping Ticket Prices Have Not Increased</p>
<p>Some American nationals in this port are concerned about the high travel expenses set by the American and Manson postal shipping companies. According to the agents of the two companies in Shanghai yesterday, the ticket prices of the four postal ships that came to Shanghai to carry American nationals evacuating are the same as usual and have not increased. The reason why they are considered expensive is that all cabins on these postal ships are of the same class, unlike the ordinary President Line postal ships, which have third-class cabins. It is generally believed that the President Line postal shipping company cannot make decisions about reducing travel expenses on its own, so the application for fee reduction should be directly requested from the State Department in Washington.</p>
<p>Mondle Liner Also Detouring to Australia</p>
<p>It is heard that the Manson postal shipping company's Mondle liner will take a detour to Australia when returning to the United States, taking thirty days from Shanghai to San Francisco. Ordinary postal ships that go directly from Shanghai to San Francisco can arrive in just two weeks. It is said that the ship will travel for two weeks more, but will not charge extra for travel expenses.</p>

<p>According to shipping industry news, the goods transported and sold to the inland areas by manufacturers in this port, which are first transshipped to Rangoon, have been loaded and exported in three batches. The goods are mostly textiles, groceries, and daily necessities, which are transported by Taikoo Steamship Company to Singapore for transshipment to Rangoon. There is another batch today, which will be transported to Singapore for transshipment to Rangoon. British shipping companies are currently considering piloting regular liners between Shanghai and Rangoon. The British liner Glay, represented by Tong Yi and Hong Yun Shipping Agencies, has decided to sail directly from Shanghai to Rangoon on the day after tomorrow (the 25th), and then to Calcutta. The ship is loaded with goods for export, does not carry passengers, and also detours to Hong Kong and Singapore. The Yilong Liner Shenguang, owned by the British firm Yilong, will also pilot sail to Rangoon on the same day as the Glay Liner. The export cargo is also managed by Tong Yi and Hong Yun Shipping Agencies. However, in order to prevent smuggled goods from being mixed into the inland areas, the National Government strictly inspects the goods transported through this route. Moreover, in view of the special environment in Shanghai, attention is paid to the goods transported from Shanghai. All goods must be strictly inspected by customs inspectors upon entry before they are released. Commercial firms in this port now attach certificates from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other organizations to the goods to prove their authenticity. On the eve of the opening, the National Government specifically telegraphed Shanghai, stating that trademarks of goods sold domestically should be registered as soon as possible for verification, and special attention should be paid to inspections along the way.</p>
<h3 id="e45">The Water and Electricity Workers' Strike in the French Concession; Labor-Management Agreement Signed; Formal Conditions Total Seven Items; Further Discussions to Continue; Arrested Workers Released Last Night; Full Traffic to Resume at 8:00 AM This Morning <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>After the water and electricity workers' strike in the French Concession, labor and management representatives were mutually nominated on the previous day (the 20th) and reached an agreement through direct negotiations. They signed the agreement at the French Water and Electricity General Company on Rue Luban at 3:00 PM yesterday. The strike, which had been delayed for 29 days, has now been formally resolved. All French public buses and trams, both tracked and trackless, will resume operations this morning. Workers arrested during the strike will be released at the same time. During the strike, the company lost more than 300,000. After the strike was resolved, the factory gates were guarded and the patrol was removed.</p>
<p>Formal Signing</p>
<p>When labor and management representatives negotiated directly the day before, all conditions had been agreed upon, but one or two minor details had not been agreed upon. The labor representatives had to notify the workers of the agreed conditions and could only sign after they had agreed, so it was delayed until 3:00 PM yesterday. The labor side then notified the management by telephone that the reply to the conditions for resuming work had been agreed to, and immediately nominated Le Zhongxing, Chen Xian, Shi Quanfu, and Zhang Fubao from the Machine Department, and Gu Jinrong, Shen Zhiqin, Pan Lujie, and Gu Xichun from the Traffic Department as representatives. They first went to the Political Department of the French Patrol and met with the Director of Political Affairs, Mallet, and Inspector Xue Gengxin. At around 4:00 PM, they accompanied the representatives to the General Company on Rue Luban, where they were received by the company's General Manager, Favrel, with the General Comprador Tu Jun in attendance. Because most of the conditions had been agreed upon the day before, after the two sides met and discussed briefly, the conditions were translated into French. After Favrel read them in detail, labor and management officially signed the agreement. The long-delayed strike was thus completely resolved.</p>
<p>Agreement Conditions</p>
<p>The agreement conditions formally signed by labor and management yesterday consisted of seven articles: (1) (Omitted) (2) Wages will be paid as usual during the strike period. (3) Workers arrested during the strike will be released and reinstated. Those who have been dismissed will be handled in accordance with Article 7 of this agreement. (4) Monthly wage increase of six yuan, implemented in accordance with the company's current regulations. (5) Workers may not be dismissed without cause. The company will announce the conditions for rewards and punishments. (6) Temporary workers will be dismissed during the strike period. (7) 30 dismissed workers, including workers numbered so-and-so, will be reinstated at the same time. The management will give lenient consideration to the reinstatement of other dismissed workers within one month. Other issues such as (1) the dismissal of Russian employees, (2) the issuance of factory work permits, (3) temporary workers' commuter passes, (4) the issuance of uniforms for field workers, (5) the issuance of year-end bonuses, and (6) wages for public holidays, will be negotiated after work resumes.</p>
<p>Work Resumes This Morning</p>
<p>The striking workers of the French Tram Company were divided into three departments: (1) The Traffic Department, including more than 400 drivers and ticket sellers of trams (tracked and trackless) and public buses; (2) The Machine Department, including more than 400 workers in the copper and carpentry shops; (3) The Engine Department, with more than 100 workers. A total of more than 1,000 workers went on strike. Yesterday afternoon, after the workers' representatives notified them in writing and verbally that "all conditions have been agreed upon, and all workers will resume work tomorrow morning," the workers prepared to resume work and are scheduled to start their usual work at 8:00 AM this morning.</p>
<p>Workers Released</p>
<p>More than 30 French tram workers were arrested during the strike, and the patrol also released them last night. The body of tram ticket seller Zhang Yongkang, who was shot and killed at Guangci Hospital, is now at the Shanghai Funeral Home in Xujiahui. It is heard that the funeral will be held today. Zhang's family consists of only a widowed mother in her forties.</p>
<p>Full Operation</p>
<p>The French Tram Company has two tram lines (Sixteenth Puli to the end of Ferguson Road), two lines (Sixteenth Puli to Xujiahui), five lines (Little North Gate to the Fire Army Station), seven lines (Sixteenth Puli to the end of Shan Zhong Road), and ten lines (Sixteenth Puli to Lujiawan), totaling 47 trams; trackless trams on Line 17 (Dapu Bridge to Sichuan Road Bridge), Line 18 (Xieqiao to the end of North Henan Road), and Line 24 (West Gate Road to Robison Road), totaling 36 vehicles; and public buses on Line 21 (Dapu Bridge to the Bund), totaling 18 vehicles, and Line 22 (Xujiahui to the Bund), totaling 39 vehicles. All seven types of vehicles are scheduled to resume operation this morning. However, some workers may not have been notified last night and may arrive late, but all vehicles should be able to resume operation by 8:00 AM at the latest. The lines connecting with the Public Concession will also resume operation.</p>
<p>British Electric Company Dispute</p>
<p>Just as the water and electricity workers' strike in the French Concession was about to be resolved, an incident occurred at the British Electric Company yesterday afternoon. A dispute arose among the machine workers at the Pei Kai Er Road tram depot, and another strike occurred. It was not resolved until late at night. However, the Traffic Department was safe and sound, and the vehicles were still operating as usual.</p>

<p>Since the National Winter Clothing Fundraising Association initiated this year's winter clothing donation campaign, all parts of the country and overseas Chinese communities have been actively promoting it. The Shanghai winter clothing donation campaign, which is being organized by the Shanghai Fundraising and慰劳Committee, has been actively promoting the doubled amount of winter clothing donations from all sectors of society. All industry associations, schools, and organizations have responded to this campaign with great enthusiasm. The expanded fundraising activities during the "August 13th," "September 18th," and National Day charity sales weeks have yielded remarkable results. As the fundraising deadline is approaching, the association is making a final appeal, hoping that all sectors of society will actively donate and notify all industry associations, schools, and organizations to remit the funds raised to the National Bank before October 31st. Do not delay beyond the deadline. All organizations that have not yet participated in the winter clothing donation campaign should consider the nation and care for the soldiers fighting in the bloodbath. It is hoped that they will quickly rise up and promote the campaign in order to fulfill the duties and responsibilities that nationals should have.</p>
<h3 id="e48">National Seamen Jointly Liable for Smuggling; Ningbo Seamen's Union Formulates Measures; Central Department of Social Affairs Approves for Implementation <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The Ningbo Seamen's Union believes that the trend of smuggling is rampant along the coast. There are more than 800,000 seamen in the country. It is feared that unscrupulous elements will be tempted, which will have a huge impact on the war of resistance. Therefore, it has formulated a method for seamen to participate in smuggling and be jointly liable, and has submitted it level by level to the Central Government for circulation to all seamen in the country for compliance. It is now heard that the union has received instructions from the Central Department of Social Affairs Lizu Zi No. 4822 and instructions from the Department of Social Affairs Lizu Zi No. 5064, stating that the measures formulated are insightful and feasible and should be approved. The Central Secretariat Yu (29) Wenzi No. 11228 has also been approved for record filing and has sent a letter to the Military Affairs Commission for reference. After receiving the order, the union has decided to first handle the joint guarantee procedures for seamen on small ferries and speedboats from October (blank) to October 15th. All employees serving on the ship must complete the commitment within the time limit, and three people must guarantee each other. If anyone fails to comply, the union will send a letter to the maritime administration agency to instruct the company to revoke their position.</p>

<p>November 21st, the date of the first air defense exercise held in Nanjing in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, has been designated by the National Government as Air Defense Day every year. It is learned that this year's Air Defense Day will be marked by expanded air defense publicity throughout the country, promoting the people's willingness to contribute money and effort to assist in the country's air defense construction. The air defense equipment handled by the local air defense agencies will also be thoroughly reviewed. In order to encourage the people of the country to be vigilant in times of peace and assist the country in strengthening its air defense construction, the people of the national drama and entertainment circles are actively preparing to build the "Dramatists' Aircraft" to donate to the government on this day. Local provincial, municipal, and county governments are also launching fundraising campaigns for air defense funds to replenish local air defense equipment.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Japanese Troops Lay Barbed Wire at the Intersection of Fuxi Road and Haig Road <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese troops have recently been intensifying their precautions in the areas under their control. For example, entry and exit from the Nanshi area had already canceled the "Citizen's Certificate," but since the day before yesterday, they have again restricted entry and exit for those who do not carry the "Citizen's Certificate." In addition, in areas such as western Shanghai and Hongkou, the search of pedestrians has become stricter again. To everyone's surprise, this morning, Japanese troops laid barbed wire on the road at the intersection of Fuxi Road and Haig Road, leaving only a small narrow opening for pedestrians and vehicles to enter and exit. Public buses were forced to stop, and strict searches were also conducted. Pedestrians entering and leaving were required to leave their names and signatures in the Japanese troops' register. The Japanese troops' intentions in doing so have made pedestrians feel very strange. Many believe that the Japanese side wants to discover certain figures, so they have the act of leaving names and signatures.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Gold Market Squeeze Suspends Trading; Resumption of Business Scheduled for Tomorrow; Futures Trading to Open for Half a Month <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai gold black market was previously suspended due to a short squeeze by the longs after the shorts sold millions, causing prices to soar and a shortage of chips, leading to a delivery impasse. After a one-day suspension the day before yesterday, the 36 member firms resolved that all transactions before October 20th would be settled at 5,830 yuan. Both longs and shorts agreed to this. The market was originally scheduled to resume business yesterday, opening for half-month futures trading, but yesterday it was temporarily decided to postpone it until tomorrow (the 24th). It is learned that the reason for the postponement is that the transactions before October 20th are still being rushed and have not been completely settled. Reluctantly, the resumption of business was postponed until the 24th. It is also heard that there is talk of reorganizing the black market, with the aim of protecting the interests of all members. After the market opens on Thursday, there will be two types of gold prices: futures and spot.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Shanghai Manufacturers' Trademarks Must Be Registered with the Ministry; In Order to Determine That Goods Transported Inland Are Domestic Goods; And Must Be Issued a Certificate by the Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao reported that it heard from reliable sources that the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in compliance with the new orders issued by the Ministry of Economy of the Central Government, has sent letters to the industry associations, requesting them to automatically register the trademarks of member stores and factories with the Ministry of Economy, so as to determine whether the goods they intend to transport into the "Free China" inland are purely domestic goods.</p>
<p>Domestic Goods Transported Inland Must Be Registered</p>
<p>According to a member of the Chamber of Commerce, the Central Government strictly enforces the regulations against non-domestic goods, fearing that the special situation in Shanghai will allow non-domestic goods to change their appearance and mix into the inland. Therefore, they must be re-registered every six months. When asked by the reporter whether the Chamber of Commerce would continue to issue certificates for domestic goods made in Shanghai and intended to be transported to "Free China," as it has done in recent months, the member replied, "Yes. Merchants must register their trademarks and continue to fill out the forms provided by the Chamber of Commerce. Goods that are to be sold inland must have a certificate from the Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber of Commerce has issued quite a few certificates recently."</p>
<p>Strict Restrictions on Non-Domestic Goods</p>
<p>It is found that the Ministry of Economy's order states that merchants can freely decide on trademark registration, but merchants should register their trademarks with the government in order to maintain their reputation and protect their commercial interests. Well-informed Chinese sources believe that at a time when Shanghai merchants are transporting large quantities of goods into the interior via Singapore and Rangoon and along the reopened Burma Road, the issuance of this order by Chongqing shows that although the Central Government currently welcomes the transportation of goods, it has a firm determination to resist non-domestic goods.</p>

<p>According to the Continental Daily, yesterday (the 21st), Commissioner Murray of the Salvation Army stated that the poor in Shanghai will face unprecedented hardship this winter. This is because unemployment in the city continues to rise, and while there were thirty-three refugee shelters last year, only two will continue to operate this winter. The Salvation Army's food distribution trucks will begin operating early this winter to prevent a recurrence of last winter's tragic event where five hundred refugees froze to death in a single night. The Salvation Army is currently drafting a plan to aid beggars, but the detailed measures have not yet been finalized. The Salvation Army implemented last winter's relief program until the summer, including sending refugees back to their hometowns as a fundamental solution. In the past half-year, the Salvation Army has funded the return of over seven hundred and sixty refugees to their hometowns. Another measure is providing 15 to 20 yuan to help them make a living as street vendors. This winter, the Salvation Army will deploy food distribution trucks one month earlier than last year to prevent more poor people from freezing to death on the streets.</p>

<p>Yesterday evening around 7 PM, three robbers suddenly broke into the Daxin Watch Store next to the Xinhuizhong Hotel on Sanma Road. Two of them were armed with pistols. They robbed wristwatches and pocket watches and fled eastward. Street constables heard the alarm and gave chase, shooting a detective. The robbers eventually escaped without a trace. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Robbed Wristwatches</p>
<p>The Daxin Watch Store at 230 Jiujiang Road, Hubei Road, next to the Xinhuizhong Hotel, is owned by a Ningbo native named Gu Baoshu and has been in business for many years. Unfortunately, this year has been unlucky, and it has been robbed repeatedly. The first time was on the sixth day of the first lunar month, when twenty-eight wristwatches were stolen. The second time was in March, when one wristwatch was stolen. Yesterday was the third time. Around 7 PM, three robbers broke in, two armed with pistols. They ordered everyone to remain silent and stole a total of forty-nine wristwatches and pocket watches, worth a total of 1,600 to 1,700 yuan, before fleeing eastward on Jiujiang Road.</p>
<p>Mistakenly Wounded Detective</p>
<p>At Huajin Lane, Shanxi Road, a Chinese constable No. 424 from the Laozha Police Station heard the alarm, drew his gun, and followed the robbers. At the same time, the Central Police Station heard the alarm and arrived in a car with many Chinese and foreign detectives. Detective Jin Desheng was chasing the robbers when Constable No. 424, mistaking him for an accomplice because he was in plain clothes and running with the robbers, fired four shots. One bullet hit Jin Desheng in the back of the head and exited through the front of his head. He fell in front of Zhang Xingji Silk Thread Shop at 100 Huajin Lane. The robbers ultimately escaped. A stray bullet shattered a pane of glass in the window of the Shixinchang Gu Embroidery Shop. Nearby constables heard the sound and rushed to the scene, sending the wounded detective to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, he died around 8 PM due to the severity of his injuries.</p>

<p>Yesterday (the 21st), around 6:50 AM, a Western child fell off his bicycle near Nanjing Road and Yunnan Road, sustaining serious injuries. Anyone who witnessed the accident is asked to report to the Laozha Police Station or R. Hallsford, a 15-year-old British child in the General Affairs Office of the Police Department. He was riding his bicycle to St. Francis Xavier's School on Nansun Road in Hongkou around 7:15 AM yesterday morning when he was knocked down by a black-plated car in front of the New World Department Store while trying to avoid a public bus. He suffered injuries to the right side of his head and abdomen. Street constables arrived to record the license plate number of the car that caused the accident and quickly summoned an ambulance to send the child to the Country Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Armed Thugs Rob Pistol <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, this morning (the 22nd), a daring robbery of a public concession police officer's service pistol occurred again in the Hongkou bandit area in western Shanghai. This morning at 8:20 AM, two Chinese constables were on duty in front of 408 Yidingpan Road when they were suddenly surrounded by four armed thugs. Two thugs pointed pistols at the constables' backs, while the other two calmly drew their guns and threatened them, robbing the constables of their service pistols before fleeing into nearby alleys without firing a shot. The police are currently investigating the case. It is reported that, according to an order issued by the Police Department several months ago due to repeated robberies of service pistols, both Chinese constables who lost their guns will be suspended from duty. Also, yesterday morning (the 21st) at 5 AM, four armed thugs surrounded a Chinese constable on Avenue Foch in the French Concession, threw lime in his face, and then robbed him of his service pistol before escaping.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Japanese Side Exonerates Thief in Major Theft Case, Will Not Let Accomplice Pengte Off Lightly <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, reliable sources say that regarding the theft of copper ingots worth US$100,000, belonging to the American firm Moller &amp; Co. and stored in the godown of the American firm Reifeng Transport Company, by Swiss national Huaiteler and his accomplices, Moller &amp; Co.'s lawyer Nelson and the Shanghai Municipal Police inspector Bennett went to the Japanese military headquarters this morning (the 22nd). A senior Japanese military officer told Bennett that the copper ingots were removed from the Reifeng Transport Company's godown for "political reasons" and that the Japanese Special Service Agency was responsible, not Huaiteler or the arrested German national Pengte. The Japanese officer reportedly presented documents proving that the copper belonged to the Chinese government and could be confiscated, for Nelson and Bennett to review. After reviewing, Bennett agreed to report the matter to Police Commissioner Major Bown. Given this morning's developments, it is believed that Pengte, Huaiteler's accomplice who was arrested by the police in Hongkou last week, may be released. At the same time, well-informed sources claim that since the Japanese authorities have officially admitted that the copper was "confiscated rather than stolen," the Swiss consulate's arrest warrant for Huaiteler may be withdrawn, and the case will be altered accordingly. It is believed that the Japanese authorities may intercede on behalf of Pengte, otherwise Pengte will appear in court on Friday for a preliminary hearing. According to the Datong News Agency, a senior police official stated that, based on today's developments in the case, there is no reason to release Pengte immediately. He implied that the police authorities believe that the principal offender in the case is a thief who stole American property and will not be treated leniently. Pengte will still be transferred to the First Special District Court on the 25th for questioning.</p>

<p>Wang Weizhen, a Wuxi woman (22 years old this year) currently residing at 583 North Shanxi Road, was a student at Guanghua University last year. A male classmate, Zhao Juzhang (living at 287 Loulong Road, a local and the same age as Wang), saw that Wang was excellent in both appearance and academics, so he pursued her in every way. After Wang lost her virginity, she secretly conceived. When her parents discovered this, the situation was already irreversible. Because Wang had already lost her virginity and was pregnant, she officially married Zhao on the 17th of this month. The couple's relationship was initially harmonious, but Wang disagreed with handing over her jewelry to her parents-in-law for safekeeping, which caused dissatisfaction among her in-laws. On February 22nd of the lunar calendar, Wang went to her maternal grandmother's house and returned late at night, but was refused entry by her in-laws and had no choice but to return to her mother's house. On the 27th of the same month, Zhao went to his in-laws' house and told Wang that he had also been kicked out by his parents. On March 12th of the lunar calendar, after lawyer Wu Zhijian certified that Wang had handed over her jewelry to her parents-in-law, Zhao hired a car to move his belongings from his home to his in-laws' house. Wang was responsible for his food and lodging. Recently, Zhao asked Wang for pocket money. On July 2nd of the lunar calendar, Wang's mother saw that her son-in-law neither studied nor worked, but idled about all day and wasted money, so she advised Zhao to reform. Not only did Zhao not listen to her advice, but he also responded with harsh words and forced Wang to leave with him. They spent the night at the Tongshang Grand Hotel, with Wang pawning her watch to pay for the room. At that time, Wang was heavily pregnant. Within a few days of leaving, she gave birth to a son at the Sino-German Hospital. Zhao never inquired about Wang during her</p>
<p>Hospital delivery. Wang's mother heard the news and rushed to settle the bill, taking Wang and the baby home to recuperate. On August 4th of the lunar calendar, Zhao went to his in-laws' house and asked Wang for 100 yuan for tuition, saying that he wanted to study. Wang felt that Zhao had no affection for her as a husband, and they quarreled. Wang's younger sister and mother came out to mediate, but Zhao invited his older brother Zhao Jianhong and actually injured his mother-in-law and sister-in-law. Later, they became involved in a lawsuit, and the Zhao brothers were both fined for assault by the Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Therefore, Zhao knew that it would be difficult for him to</p>
<p>Grow old together with Wang, and stated on the phone that if Wang wanted a divorce, she would have to compensate him 20,000 yuan. Wang felt that Zhao had no affection for her as a husband and recently hired lawyer Zheng Lintong to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the First Special Court, suing for divorce and requesting 2,000 yuan in consolation money. Zhao also filed a lawsuit requesting cohabitation. Regarding the cohabitation portion, Judge Ni opened the Third Civil Court at 3 PM yesterday to summon them. Zhao stated that the couple's relationship was still good and requested that Wang be ordered to return home to cohabitate. Wang's lawyer, Zheng Lintong, stated the details of the abuse by the opposing party and her parents-in-law and firmly opposed cohabitation, advocating for divorce. The court hearing was adjourned for further questioning and advised both parties to reconcile during the adjournment.</p>

<h3 id="e63">"China-Japan Economic Research Association" Auto Transports Opium, Three Convicted to Imprisonment <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The head of the "China-Japan Economic Research Association" at 82 Tongfu Road, Chinese national Ding Guohua, ordered accountants Qian Yangyuan and Liu Mingsheng on the 14th of this month to transport 128 taels of opium soil in car number 9118 (owned by Li Ruijiu, the grandson of Li Hongzhang, residing at 150 Yidingpan Road), driven by chauffeur Cao Musheng, to a buyer at a certain address on Shandong Road. However, they were intercepted by officers from the Public Concession Anti-Narcotics Department at the entrance of the alley and Qian, Liu, and Cao were taken back to the police station along with the opium and the car, and sent to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xieyi continued the trial in the First Criminal Court. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that the address at 82 Tongfu Road belonged to a secret organization engaged in opium trafficking, and that car number 9118 was claimed by a Japanese national from the police. The police are now prosecuting the defendants under Article 5 of the Anti-Opium Regulations and should be punished according to the law. Qian Yangyuan testified that he was not aware of the transport of the opium. Liu Mingsheng testified that he was ordered by Ding Guohua to deliver it. Cao Musheng testified that the car he was driving belonged to the Li family and was borrowed by the people at 82 Tongfu Road. He was ordered to drive to Shandong Road and had no idea that he was transporting opium. They had no lawyers to defend them. Judge Xiao reviewed the case and announced the verdict in court: Qian Yangyuan and Liu Mingsheng were each sentenced to five years in prison for transporting opium, fined 1,000 yuan, and deprived of civil rights for five years. Cao Musheng was convicted of the same crime and sentenced to two years and six months in prison and deprived of civil rights for two years. The 128 taels of opium soil were confiscated.</p>

<h3 id="e65">China Medical College Turns Over and Sues for Funds, Struggle for Rights, Debt Dispute Resolved Through Reconciliation <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>The China Medical College at 10, Lane 177, Chongqing Road, was formerly run by Guo Boliang, a doctor of Chinese medicine, as the president of the college. This spring, Guo, due to the poor business of the college, turned it over to Ma Wenwo, Wang Zhi, Guo Baokui, Ni Guoxin, Li Yangru, Yang Youlin, and Zhu Wenming for 7,000 yuan to continue operations. Each person contributed 500 yuan, totaling 3,500 yuan, with 3,000 yuan paid to Guo for the transfer fee and the remaining 500 yuan used for newspaper advertisements. Ma and others actually</p>
<p>Publicized Heavily in Newspapers and hired the famous doctor Qin Bowei as the president of the college. Students came in droves. At the end of the semester, in addition to paying Guo Boliang another 2,000 yuan for the transfer fee, there was a surplus of over 5,000 yuan. When the first semester began in July, Ma Wenwo, Wang Zhi, Guo Baokui, Ni Guoxin, Li Yangru, Yang Youlin, and the six school directors competed fiercely for the college because it was profitable. First, Zhu Wenming, one of the founders of the college and the chief of general affairs, was expelled. This caused a storm in the college. Qin Bowei saw that Ma and others treated the school as a commercial tool and found it</p>
<p>Difficult to Cooperate, so he resigned on his own. Ma and others then transferred the college to the Zhu Hegao and Zhu Xiaonan brothers. The Zhu brothers then competed with each other for the position of president, and lawsuits arose one after another, which were reported in the newspapers. However, Guo Boliang still had 2,000 yuan that he had not received and repeatedly demanded payment. He then filed a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the First Special Court against Zhu Wenming, Ma Wenwo, and others for debt. The case was judged and executed, and Zhu and Ma jointly drew up an agreement to repay the debt. Unexpectedly, after the agreement was drawn up, Ma and the other six</p>
<p>Failed to Pay, so Zhu Wenming filed a lawsuit against Ma Wenwo, Wang Zhi, Guo Baokui, Ni Guoxin, Li Yangru, and Yang Youlin in the Civil Division of the Second Special Court for debt. The court accepted the case, and Judge Tan Hao opened the Seventh Civil Court yesterday morning to hear the case. Only Ma Wenwo and his colleagues appeared. After the court questioned both parties in detail, it was found that the case arose entirely from the school, and that lawsuits involving schools have been heard frequently recently, which is not a good sign for the education sector. Therefore, it was advised that</p>
<p>Both Parties Reconcile. After discussing the conditions in court, the following written reconciliation was reached: (1) The defendants will return 342 yuan and 88 cents; (2) The defendants will repay the 2,000 yuan owed to Guo Boliang in proportion, and the promissory note will be destroyed; (3) The defendants will bear 25 yuan of the litigation costs in proportion. A complex school dispute was thus completely resolved.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Ministry of Education Concerned About Student Meals, Orders Promulgation of Meal Relief Measures, Pre-Funds and Maximally Purchases and Stores Food, Government Should Facilitate Procurement of Boats and Vehicles <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing Aviation News) The Ministry of Education, in view of the fact that student meals in large and medium-sized schools in various places are insufficient due to high prices and are often in a state of unrest, has specially drafted six provisional measures for wartime relief of student meals in large and medium-sized schools and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for amendment and implementation. In addition to being sent by the Yuan to the Military Affairs Commission, it was also ordered to the provincial governments and relevant ministries and commissions to comply. The following is a summary of these measures:</p>
<p>Purchasing and Storing Grain. All student living expenses, such as higher and general education relief funds, and student living expenses in national middle school funds, shall be pre-funded for six months by the Ministry of Finance in January and July each year. Each school's expenses shall also be pre-funded for one month so that each school can transfer a portion of the student loan funds and the school's funds to purchase and store food as much as possible during the spring months of January and February and the autumn months of July and August in preparation for the lean season and high food prices. To avoid excessive accumulation and mold, the school may consult with rice merchants to order rice in installments, extract it in stages, and have the local government and chamber of commerce guarantee and supervise the rice merchants' storage of grain.</p>
<p>Assisting in Procurement. Schools in rice-producing areas should make large-scale purchases. If they are in rice-deficient areas, they must find ways to transport rice. They may also request the local Ministry of Economic Affairs' Agricultural Bureau and its affiliated agencies, as well as disaster relief, military, and transportation agencies, and the provincial government to provide full assistance and convenience when schools purchase food or need boats, vehicles, and manpower for transportation, but only to the extent of the actual amount needed by each school.</p>
<p>Improving Management. Schools should be responsible for assisting in the management of student meals. Neighboring schools should discuss management methods with each other and should not simply hand over the meals to the students themselves and claim that they have fulfilled their responsibilities.</p>
<p>Investigating and Reporting Prices. Current prices are constantly changing and should be investigated and reported to the Ministry by each school on a monthly basis according to the following items: (1) Rice, (2) Coal or firewood, (3) Oils - lard - sesame oil - peanut oil, etc., (4) Salt, (5) Pork, (6) Beef or mutton, (7) Eggs, (8) Fish, (9) Beans, (10) Vegetables, (11) Pickled vegetables, (12) Pickled sauces and soy sauce, (13) Other necessary foods. Prices calculated by the catty should be in units of market catties. Prices calculated by the dou should also be converted into units of market catties for consistency.</p>
<p>Self-Production. Each school should conscientiously implement the general outline of agricultural production methods for schools at all levels promulgated by the Ministry to cultivate students' agricultural and vegetable life skills and increase students' food nutrition.</p>
<p>Examining Quantities. The National Jiangsu Institute of Medicine and the Ministry's Medical Education Committee will examine the quantity of each food listed in item 4 required by each student per month according to their age (all calculated in market catties for those calculated by the catty or dou) to meet nutritional requirements and will be jointly examined and reported to the Ministry for reference by each school.</p>

<p>The Silver Coin Cup table tennis tournament took place at the Silver Union Club the previous evening, with Jincheng playing against Tongshang. After the lineups were set, Zhu Xiguang, a good chopper from Jincheng, took the lead and won effortlessly. Unexpectedly, Zhu faced off in the match before his turn due to some matter. Although he still won three consecutive games, he finally lost to Tongshang's new player in the fourth game due to fatigue from the long battle. The last game was defeated by Liu Jihan. After that, the battle between the two sides was extremely tense, resulting in a twelve-way tie. In the final game, Hua Ming, Jincheng's ever-victorious general, faced Liu Jihan, Tongshang's main player. Liu attacked Hua's chop, with wonderful performances throughout. Liu finally achieved the final victory. As a result, Tongshang defeated Jincheng by thirteen to twelve, which can be said to be extremely lucky. According to international rules, five people must participate in the competition and take turns in order. There has never been a case where one person plays five consecutive times. The two teams violated the international competition system. In the other three matches, China Secondary School won. Only one match was held today.

<h3 id="e79">Finance: A Two-Sided View of the Future of Foreign Exchange, Ruo Qing <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Since the Battle of Shanghai, due to the special status of this port, capital from various regions has flocked here. A portion of commercial capital has also lost its elasticity, and floating capital has become congested. As a result, a high wave of prices has been set off, with extreme oscillations of gain and loss. However, in the past two years, holding foreign exchange and gold has been beneficial, which is why assets are entrusted here and people rush to this path in panic. However, the legal tender has been severely damaged as a result. Recently, with the UK restricting the import of British banknotes and the US loan providing ample assistance, the international situation has gradually transformed, and foreign exchange has seen some hope. What the future holds is something that people urgently want to speculate on. I will attempt to analyze it from two perspectives by synthesizing various factors.</p>
<p>Factors that can cause the exchange rate to tighten:</p>
<p>(1) Export goods from the occupied areas are subject to restrictions, and the trade surplus will inevitably weaken. Although the trade deficit has been reduced, the number of major items such as rice is still large, which may attract more bulls to follow suit due to this need.</p>
<p>(2) Shanghai is full of funds, and deposit interest rates have been reduced. Owning a large amount of cash can easily drive it into the foreign exchange market.</p>
<p>(3) The United States has not yet joined the war, and its currency status is far superior to any other country. If the situation deteriorates, the capital obtained from the release of stocks in this city may be used to purchase foreign exchange.</p>
<p>(4) Funds flowing into Shanghai from Hong Kong and other parts of Southeast Asia are gradually decreasing.</p>
<p>(5) Banks that own foreign exchange may tend to purchase foreign exchange in order to maintain paper profits and prevent the exchange rate from lengthening.</p>
<p>(6) If Shanghai's neutral status is threatened, the Chinese government may purchase a large amount of foreign exchange.</p>
<p>(7) If the United States abandons Shanghai, the legal tender circulating in this city may encounter unfavorable conditions.</p>
<p>(8) Due to the current proximity of near and far terms, there are very few hedging chips. Speculators who are not in a hurry to release can extend the chips to the far term with a slight interest.</p>
<p>Factors that can cause the exchange rate to lengthen:</p>
<p>(1) Shanghai's commercial decline reduces the need for foreign exchange for importers.</p>
<p>(2) There is a possibility of further Anglo-American aid to China.</p>
<p>(3) The depreciation of the legal tender has reached a high level, and it may tend to be eased in the future. If the United States is involved in the war vortex, the exchange rate between the US dollar and the legal tender will depreciate rapidly, which puts the legal tender in a favorable position.</p>
<p>(4) If the situation in the Far East deteriorates further, the shipping industry will be adversely affected, thereby reducing the need for import drafts.</p>
<p>(5) If all the American expatriates withdraw, all accounts in China may be frozen.</p>
<p>(6) The rise in the free exchange rate of gold pounds may be due to the British government's control or the lack of supply, both of which can lengthen the US exchange rate.</p>
<p>(7) There are too many speculative bull chips in the market. Speculators are eager to release because the expected tightening has not been realized. Any news that is favorable to China or implies that the United States will be involved in the Far East vortex can easily trigger this release.</p>
<p>(8) If the situation in this city deteriorates, banks may sell foreign exchange to obtain cash to meet the withdrawals of depositors.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Foreign Exchange Quiet <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listing showed no rise or fall. The black market for British and American exchange rates can be described as stable. Although speculators still entered and exited, there was no significant response. The range of fluctuations was narrow, and people seemed to be waiting for new developments. At noon, Huahang sold aggressively and loosened. The market later hardened as speculators also exited. However, it returned to balance at the close. As a result, the spot price was indistinguishable from the previous day's close. The futures price of the US exchange rate and the spot price have been squeezed together.</p>

<p>Since the cash black market in this city changed to spot futures trading after the industry saw that cash chips were short, settling clearly every half month, it was originally scheduled to open yesterday. Now, because the market affairs and various procedures are not yet complete, and for the benefit and protection of each member, it is necessary to be cautious and discuss the matter carefully before determining the opening date. It is heard that as of last night, 22 peers have agreed to rejoin, mostly from the money exchange industry, silver firms, and securities firms. They will continue to hold a meeting at a certain place this afternoon in preparation for the official opening tomorrow (24th). It is heard that yesterday, cash outside the market was traded both in the morning and afternoon, with the price being 5,800 yuan, down 30 yuan from the previous weekend. All were delivered at the time. The exchange price of gold for jewelry in pawnshops, both large and new, still remained at 600 yuan unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Fake Aluminum Coins <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Aluminum coins have not been circulating for long, and counterfeit coins have already been found. Counterfeit coins have less luster and a dark gray color (no different from lead). The upper left stroke of the words "five fen" is slightly curved and thinner on the real coin, while it is thicker and straighter on the counterfeit coin. The outline of the swastika pattern on the real coin is clear and flat, while it is blurred and uneven on the counterfeit coin. The surface near the words "Zhonghua" is flat and sunken. On the ancient coin, the surrounding area is smooth and bright, and there are fine pinpoints in the coin, so the shading is distinct. On the counterfeit coin, there are no fine dots in the center of the coin, and the surrounding area is the same as the shiny surface. This is the easiest to identify, but the weight is the same.

The Hong Kong note fell and then rebounded. The momentum of the Japanese gold note became stronger, and the evening market rose to 1 yuan and 4 jiao and 4 fen and a half, continuing to rise by 3 fen and a half compared to the previous day. The supply and demand for Korean notes was still even, and the market price was stable. The evening market was still 1 yuan and 1 jiao and 9 fen.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Miscellaneous Grains: Little Interest in the Bean Market <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the soybean market has felt quite deserted. In general, speculators have felt constrained by supply and demand, making it difficult to generate interest, so they have not taken drastic measures. Although the overall situation is stagnant, the market price has not risen or fallen excessively. Moreover, it is not easy for cargo parties to transport, and the cost is heavy and the profit is small, so they are unwilling to let go easily. Secondly, actual sales are average, and most compradores are waiting and watching. The market atmosphere is dull. Apart from 2,300 to 2,400 bags of Tianjin new beans being killed into the Hong Kong and Guangdong streets (priced at 41.50 to 40 yuan), there were only a few transactions on this street. It is estimated that 50 bags of Qingdao Chen beans were traded, priced at 35.90 yuan, 100 bags of Sangyuan beans, priced at 33.50 yuan, and 180 bags of Chongming Shayang beans, priced at 31.50 yuan, 18 bags of Changzhou Oxhide Qing beans, priced at 31 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 1,300 cans of raw oil came from Yantai, and today, 1,915 bags of rapeseed were shipped to Hong Kong, as well as 185 bags of beans, 620 pieces of bean cake, and 1,000 bags of raw kernels shipped to Singapore, 575 bags of sesame, and 200 cans of sesame oil shipped to Hong Kong (year).</p>

<p>Imported rice was once tight, but yesterday the market opened and people continued to feel good. Many foreign households in the industry made inquiries, and it was later rumored that the production area had increased the military expense by 2 yuan per bag, and the situation was even tighter. Not only did the general floating households absorb more, but also the traveling merchants added more, causing those with goods to call out repeatedly. In the central market, all prices rose by 1 yuan in an instant. Afterwards, they continued to be vigorous, and as a result, they increased by another half yuan. Looking at the closing market conditions, No. 2 Saigon was 64.50 to 64 yuan, No. 2 Siam was 61.50 yuan, and Small Shajiao was 61.50 yuan, an increase of 1.50 yuan compared to the previous market closing price. Rice Tea Kai was 54.50 to 54 yuan, Broken Tip was 53.50 yuan, and the second grade was 51 yuan. Red Tip Kai was 58 yuan, and Wuhu Tip was also good for 1 or 2 yuan, selling for 612 yuan. The original bag of English Hua Si Saigon No. 2 rice was even more noticed by all parties. The price of the arrived rice opened to 75.60 yuan, and then increased by another 5 jiao, which was a sharp increase of 2 yuan compared to the price of 74 yuan the day before. The original open price of road cargo was 74 yuan, and then increased by half a yuan, to 74.50 yuan, which was also an increase of 1.30 yuan compared to the day before. However, there was a profit taking in the noon market, and the market gradually turned flat, and the price returned to a small 2 or 3 jiao. The total number of original rice opened was ... bags, and the original bag was 450 tons.</p>
<p>A total of more than 2,000 bags of new japonica, point kiln, wild rice, etc. have arrived. In terms of sales, new japonica is hot, so it has risen by 1 yuan alone. The original bag was opened at 76 yuan, the second grade was 74 yuan, and the Dou Jian Zhongguan was 72.50 yuan to 70.50 yuan. The supply and demand of ... and wild rice are similar, with no gains or losses. Kiln seedlings sold for 77 yuan, wild rice for 79 yuan and 78.60 yuan, and Duyangjian was also lacking, selling the original bag of Dujian for 69 yuan, a special grade for 70 yuan, and the Dou ... for 66 yuan. The Yangjian original bag was 70 yuan. ... Zhongdai tightened, Changjing was 83 ..., ... Jing was 80 yuan, and the second grade was 767 yuan. Nangang Douzao was 80 yuan and 789 yuan.</p>
<p>The destination of glutinous rice, both domestic and foreign goods, saw a transfer, so the market lacked change. Yili special goods are still 778 yuan, Hong Kong special yuan 756 yuan, glutinous rice tea 66 yuan, 65.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Imported rice is coming one after another. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Nanlun also transported 3,066 bags from Hong Kong. It arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and stopped at the company's wharf in Pudong to unload. Jardine Matheson's Yongsheng Wheel also loaded 14,457 bags from Hong Kong and arrived at the port yesterday afternoon, stopping at the Roosevelt Wharf to unload. The Canton Wheel managed by the French company loaded more than 11,000 bags directly from Haiphong and arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and is currently unloading. Yesterday, the three wheels loaded a total of ... 8,523 bags of imported rice (Zu).</p>
<h3 id="e87">Flour Remains Firm <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Flour: The market remained firm as usual yesterday. The disc from Flour Mill No. 1 was checked and was 17 yuan. The number of batches issued by the two factories was large, estimated to be nearly 10,000 bags, so the supply of spot goods was slightly ample. However, the recycled loan chips are still lacking and the asking price is also high. 200 bags of Phoenix brand were handled by this street, priced at 17.60 yuan. At present, the shipment of Japanese flour to the concession is prohibited, and spot goods are also lacking. Foreign flour is in short supply due to a lack of orders, and the inventory will be exhausted. The price must be 19.34 yuan, and the Gao brand is approaching 20 yuan. Only 3400 bags have been traded.</p>
<p>Wheat: There was still no development in yesterday's transaction. Because the source of inland sources has been scarce for a long time, and the arrival of foreign wheat is also quiet, although the factories want to buy, they suffer from the lack of goods to take. Only a few are occasionally transported to the vicinity of Pudong, and they must be directly allocated to Japanese factories outside the boundary, and the price is only 21 yuan. For those transported into the concession, the selling price must be increased by 3 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Securities: Domestic Debt Rises Again, Slightly Looser in the Afternoon <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>In the securities black market, the market continued to move towards higher peaks yesterday, with new peaks appearing one after another. C-grade and E-grade broke through the 60 yuan mark again, and C-grade even saw a high price of 61 yuan. However, the situation gradually loosened in the afternoon. Trading was concentrated in C-grade and E-grade. A certain bank mostly sold out every day, and the bulls gradually moved. The market price has risen sharply for three consecutive days, with a sharp increase of more than 3 yuan, and has not seen any return. It is doubtful whether there is a continuous ability in the future. Yesterday's transactions were even more prosperous. Hongda bought the most vigorously throughout the day, and Tongkang Trading was also not weak. Yitai's demand was also extremely strong, and there was absorption both in the morning and afternoon. The rest, such as Datong Zhongfu Renyu Dafeng, etc., as well as a large number of retail investors, have made up for it or done more. Jiufeng Xinchang and No. 7 have been selling continuously from beginning to end, completely for spot delivery. Xinhua Lianyi bulls were released, and Yongfeng Yongkang also vomited. The market price from morning to noon closed at a new high price for all grades except A-grade. C-grade and E-grade both closed outside the 60 yuan mark. In the afternoon, they raised again, but gradually returned to looseness after opening, which was smaller than in the morning. However, the result still rose by three, five, or six jiao. The total number of transactions throughout the day was nearly 3 million yuan. A simple table is listed below.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 100 shares of China Merchants Electric were traded at a price of 6 yuan and 5 jiao. The stock market is extraordinary. Although there are many rumors, their impact on prices is also small. The shorts have made up for it at a low price. Near the close, the buyers of various stocks were extremely enthusiastic, and rubber stocks were slightly tired. The number of subscriptions for the new shares of Jardine Matheson Beer, which will be issued this Thursday, is already very large, and it is expected that the amount will be considerable.</p>
<p>London, 21st (Monday) Telegraph. The market prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks listed today are still flat, and the market is generally unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Cotton Yarn: Yarn price once reached 1,300 yuan, 5,000 bales of yarn shipped to Hong Kong <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>In the cotton yarn market, under the frenzied speculation of various parties, yesterday's trend changed from initial rise to subsequent fall, and then to a firm stance. This was because actual transactions and purchases were mainly for two types: coarse yarn and 32-count fine yarn. However, the demand for 20-count yarn alone decreased, so speculators single-mindedly bought and sold singles from the Double Horse factory as target commodities. It was found that securities firms and gold firms completely treated it as a commodity to be traded. They would buy when the market was tight and sell when it was loose. However, factories and fellow traders tended to sell when prices were high. Although the market was good, the base price was too high, and the struggle between bulls and bears was fierce, so people were inevitably uneasy.</p>
<p>Spot yarn has already opened. In the afternoon of the previous day, the bulls had raised the price to 1,290 yuan. The opening situation was turbulent, and they took the opportunity to call out prices in a chaotic manner. There were countless offers. The opening price for the first lot was 1,295 yuan. At this price, everyone rushed to buy, and supply fell short of demand, as if it were a national treasure. The highest price once reached 1,302 yuan. Unexpectedly, the market price of a certain exchange was mediocre. Many floating orders were sold out. Fellow traders also sold, and the price instantly fell back to 1,287 yuan. The bears covered their positions, and the price rose again to 1,194 yuan. Soon after, as it approached 11 o'clock, general floating accounts, considering the unfavorable situation, fell to 1,280 yuan. According to the day's transaction statistics, 5,435 bales were traded. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 10 yuan. The amounts bought by each firm are listed below:</p>
<p>Fellow traders: 4,240; Hong Kong: 1,155</p>
<p>Inland: 40; Total: 5,435</p>
<p>Another report says that speculators believe that rather than paying 400 yuan in margin for a "strip" (futures), it is better to pay 150 yuan in margin to speculate on cotton yarn. Therefore, some people rushed to the cotton yarn market, and scalpers added fuel to the fire. The yarn price fluctuated around 1,290 yuan, and some people believed that this price level of around 1,300 yuan had been firmly established. They rushed to buy during every brief rally after a major rise. Outsiders followed suit, but the insiders still made the most profit. The bulls believe that if Hong Kong firms continue to purchase, and the Yunnan-Burma Road can transport yarn, and the international situation remains gloomy, the price of 20-count yarn at 1,600 or 1,700 yuan may reappear. The bears have a different view, believing that actual sales are hindered in various ways, the route to the interior is uncertain, and besides, prices are already high, and consumption is shrinking. In the end, there will be a sense that although prices are high, it is difficult to sell goods. (Zhao)</p>
<p>Cotton yarn exports have been continuous for days. Today, 4,865 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, and another 90 bales were shipped to Singapore for transshipment to Rangoon.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Imported Cotton Remains Strong <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Spot cotton remains stable, but the demand from factories is still not huge. However, most people are optimistic. Tens of thousands of bales of Indian cotton purchased from overseas in the past are expected to arrive in Shanghai at the beginning of next month. Due to reduced working hours, Japanese factories have greatly reduced the use of raw materials. Today, 365 bales of cotton were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Another report says that in the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market was quiet and lacked major buyers. At the same time, due to the weakness of stock prices on Wall Street, the closing price, except for October, rose by 2 points, while the distant months all fell by 1-2 points. Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by more than 1 rupee.</p>
<p>Although the trading of imported cotton in Shanghai was not very lively, the selling price was unusually firm. Factories, encouraged by the rising yarn prices, were very keen on purchasing cotton. The inventory in the market was completely bought up. Therefore, fellow traders are also optimistic about the continued rise in cotton prices.</p>

<p>Overseas silk prices have fallen in both Japan and the United States. Yokohama spot prices fell by 50 yuan, and forward prices fell by 7 yuan. New York near-term prices fell by 8.5 cents, and far-term prices fell by 5 cents. The previous week's surge was stimulated by rumors of war. Now, facts prove that Japanese silk shipments to the United States have not been restricted, so silk prices have relaxed again. Local silk prices are still high. It is said that Tussah silk is selling for 3,900 yuan because the source has disappeared.</p>

<p>After the appearance of new shelled peanuts, the fixed-price goods once opened at 59 yuan. Now, the price of Qingdao-produced peanuts has eased and is gradually falling back. Qingdao peanuts are 50 yuan, and Yangzhou peanuts are 47 yuan. The market is still wary of further declines.</p>
<h3 id="e93">New Lotus Seeds Appear <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>New lotus seeds have appeared in the production areas for nearly a month. Due to traffic obstructions, they have been lacking in shipments for a long time. Now that shipping there has been slightly opened, the first batch arrived in Shanghai yesterday, with only 20-30 pieces. The goods are better in quality. It is said that the cost has increased by more than double compared to before.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Dried Lily Bulbs are Weak <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Although the arrival of dried lily bulbs has not been large recently, the outflow from all parties is very sluggish. Therefore, the market trend has become weak. The previous market price was 52-53 yuan, but now it has retreated into the 50 yuan range. The higher price is 48-49 yuan.</p>

<p>The arrival of Hongji No. 1 small coal lumps has been very scarce in recent months. In addition, a certain foreign firm stopped selling to fellow traders last week, causing the black market to become tense. Yesterday, screened small coal lumps, when bundled with self-truck yard fees, were quoted at 240 yuan per ton, and unscreened small coal lumps were 132 yuan, an increase of 8 yuan compared to last week's price. In retail stores on this street, No. 1 small coal lumps are 12 yuan and 8 jiao per stove.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Piece Goods: Home Spun Wool Popular <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Home spun four-piece wool is selling very well, mainly for men's overcoats. The wholesale price of the top grade is 45-46 yuan per yard, and the ordinary grades are all sold for more than 30 yuan. The thinner mass-produced goods are all sold for 25-26 yuan per yard. The cutting and sales in stores are very high every day, and the sample business of dismantling stores is also good. The thinner mass-produced Home spun four-piece wool is mostly suitable for hunting suits and bloomers. Those who make overcoats mostly prefer the thicker quality. According to reports, Home spun four-piece wool and Harris tweed are popular for autumn overcoats now.</p>
<p>In addition, 1,470 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Hong Kong today (October 23), and 45 pieces were shipped to Singapore. Also, 17 boxes of wool were shipped to Piba.</p>

<p>The sales of electric silk satin are very brisk. Tailors who make Western suits generally place orders. Yuanchangxing, Huayang, Dechang, Zhang Xiangtai, and other stores specializing in making buttons have all placed large orders one after another. Chinese and Western style overcoats are launched on the market in a timely manner, so the actual sales of this electric silk satin are particularly brisk. In addition, the market for real silk satin is rising, and sales are even stronger. Most men's clothing stores prefer heavier yarn-backed fabrics, while women's clothing stores mostly prefer the more affordable, lighter, and thinner Guangming satin.

<h3 id="e98">A Letter to Working Youth <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Sui Zhen</p>
<p>Friend: In your letter, you lament to me, believing that countless demons surround you, leaving you without warm clothes or enough to eat. You struggle all day for a living, but the results are the opposite of what you hope for. Thus, you curse the injustice society has dealt you, viewing life with indifference and a loss of spirit. Eventually, unable to withstand the mounting pressure, society pushes you into a dead end.</p>
<p>Dear friend! Here, I tell you, your thinking is distorted. The journey of a person is like a small boat in a raging sea. You must go against the current, exerting your greatest effort, and you should have no regrets even if you die trying. Even if you don't reach your ideal destination, your great spirit and character can serve as a model for those who come after you. Your life will not have been in vain. If you drift with the current, you will only head towards self-destruction. Being eliminated by society is to be expected, and those who share your inertia are merely the weak.</p>
<p>Your being burdened by clothing and food is largely a social problem, but a small part of it is still within yourself. Some people in society are able to live in abundance and comfort, some due to the blessings of their ancestors, others through speculation or exploitation, but some have earned it with their own hands and minds. The former is not a good example to follow, but the latter can be emulated. God has given all humans the same five senses and four limbs. Unless you have a disability, there are countless things that humans can and should do. The method of survival lies solely in whether you do it or not. If you are usually a member of the long-gown class, when the day comes that you can no longer maintain it, you might as well resolutely become a laborer. You must not be blinded by material desires, nor should you think too highly of yourself, believing that you are above lowering yourself. For example, riding in a 1940s car is naturally more relaxed and comfortable than walking. Fine clothes and delicacies are always more comfortable and delicious than simple clothes and meals. Most of life's suffering comes from this contrast. It is easy to go from frugality to extravagance. Mencius once declared that we must strain our muscles and bones and starve our bodies in order to be capable of bearing heavy responsibilities. As long as you are not in a situation where you are without clothes to cover your body or food to eat, there will always be people behind you who are worse off than you. Thinking this way, you can be calm and forget all the hardships and move forward with reason. Courageous progress may lead to success, but it is not guaranteed. As I mentioned before, please consider enduring hardship as a matter of course. Extravagant enjoyment is merely temporary good fortune. If you want to maintain a certain standard of living, it depends on your perseverance and determination. In the current environment, don't be too optimistic or too pessimistic. Use both your hands and brain, reason and emotion. Throughout history, many great people have never had their ambitions thwarted by the hardships of life. If you have extra time, it is best to read biographies of famous people, which will undoubtedly provide more insightful and detailed inspiration. I will stop here for now, until you begin to walk on a smooth road from the thorns. If there is an opportunity in the future, we can discuss it further. Wishing you a happy spirit!</p>
<h3 id="e99">Guessing Riddles to Swindle Postage Stamps <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>Recently, several advertising companies and businesses have sponsored prize-winning riddle-guessing contests. Those who guess the most correctly can win valuable items, which is indeed true. It is said that each time, participation is very enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Cunning people saw through this psychology, and with a change of mind, they thought of getting some "extra income" from it. On the third day of last month, there was an anonymous riddle-guessing advertisement, with thirty riddles. The first prize was two winners, each receiving a gift certificate worth 50 yuan from ×× Company. Other second, third, and fourth place winners would receive considerable prizes. The answers were to be revealed at the end of last month. The mailing address was PO Box ×××. Those participating in the riddle-guessing contest had to enclose a five-cent stamp, otherwise it would be invalid. At the time, we were somewhat suspicious, but after some well-intentioned explanation, we thought that the five-cent stamp requirement might be a form of restriction, so we didn't mind it. However, up to this day, the answers have not been revealed, so we have concluded that it was a scam. I think there must be quite a few people who have been deceived.</p>
<p>Don't underestimate the five-cent stamp. The scammer's calculations are very precise. For example, if there are 500 participants, he can swindle 25 yuan. If there are 5,000 participants, he will get 250 yuan. It is possible that the number of participants exceeds these figures. Anyway, apart from the one-day advertising fee and the post office box rental fee, he doesn't spend any other capital. Recently, another ×× riddle-guessing advertisement appeared in the newspaper, with the first prize being a gift certificate worth 100 yuan from ×× Company. Whether this is another scam remains to be seen.</p>
<p>There are so many slippery things in Shanghai. We must be careful everywhere to avoid being deceived. I have now obtained a small secret, which I might as well tell everyone, which is: first, don't be greedy for small gains; second, don't fall for anything that requires you to send in postage stamps or money.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Ghost A: The world is really terrible now. A dan of white rice sells for eighty or ninety yuan. How are people supposed to live? Ghost B: We're really lucky. We left the world early; otherwise, we'd be suffering in the world too! <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>

<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Nine Surprising News</p>
<p>Jinmei argued, "Sir, I haven't been hiding anything. I've told you everything I know. As for Young Master Yu's matter, I'm not trying to protect him either. Whether he's guilty or not, you'll find out. My words—"</p>
<p>I interrupted her, "Jinmei, don't show off your mouth. You must understand that this is a murder case. If you're not involved in the murder but are trying to cover up for someone because of a small amount of money or other relationships, you'll bring disaster upon yourself. Think about it. It's not worth suffering and being punished for someone else. Jinmei, this is my well-intentioned advice, and you should understand."</p>
<p>These words of mine didn't have much of a threatening tone, but they produced an unexpected effect. She stared at me for a few seconds, with some watery looks in her eyes. Her voice was also somewhat choked up when she answered.</p>
<p>She said, "Sir, I understand that this is your kindness. However, because Young Master Yu has always treated me very well, and his actions are indeed a bit suspicious in this matter, I just—just wanted to help him. Now I can honestly say that he had an argument with Miss Wang on the phone yesterday morning, and after this murder happened last night, he also came to the gate to see what was going on. I gave him a signal to leave—"</p>
<p>I interrupted her again, "We already know about his matter, so you don't need to say any more. Besides him, are you protecting anyone else?"</p>
<p>Jinmei raised her head and replied, "No, who else would there be?"</p>
<p>I said, "For example, Li Laoye's son, Li Shouqi, came from Suzhou the day before yesterday and stayed overnight in the lane. You wouldn't mention that either."</p>
<p>She suddenly widened her tearful eyes and said in surprise, "Ah—him—" She paused slightly and continued, "Sir, you haven't asked me about him. Why would I help him? I only have a slight acquaintance with him. You didn't mention him, and out of respect for Li Laoye, I naturally wouldn't dare to say anything rash. Because this matter is very serious. Of course, I don't want to bring trouble upon myself. Sir, don't misunderstand me. I'm definitely not deliberately protecting him."</p>
<p>I was secretly pleased. Judging from Jinmei's tone, I expected that there must be some moving elements in the story about Li Shouqi, and in the current situation, it wouldn't be too difficult to get her to tell this story that I was eager to know. (144)</p>

<h3 id="e102">A Typical Figure in the Comedian Role: The Four Elders of the Old Capital's Pear Garden <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Sick Dove</p>
<p>Shi Huibao, Shang Heyu, Cheng Jixian, and Xiao Changhua, four actors who, in their twilight years, still want to put on makeup and perform on stage, are known as the Four Elders of the Old Capital's Pear Garden. This spring, they tried to form an elderly troupe to perform in Tianjin and Beijing, but ultimately stopped performing due to poor ticket sales. The Yangtze River's front waves push the back waves, old age is worthless. Metabolism is indeed cruel, and the sadness caused by this fact must be recorded.</p>
<p>Shi Huibao</p>
<p>Is the only remaining fruit of the Sun school of old male roles. There were three scholars of the Sun school, Bai Wenkui and Ke Ting, but their names did not reach Zhinong's. Zhinong had a very bright voice in his early years, grand and unrestrained, and honest. He learned the straight forward style of the Sun school, disregarding the rules and doing as he pleased. His enunciation was more accurate than Mr. Sun's, without local accents. His posture was elegant and natural, and more handsome than his teacher's. Years ago, when he came to Shanghai, I saw his performance in the play "Ascending the Heavenly Terrace." His stage steps were solid and his appearance was very beautiful. The archetype was right there, making it hard to believe that he was past sixty years old. His singing was limited by his age, his voice was insufficient, and his sorrowful expression was weak, as if he was struggling to do what he could no longer do. The Sun school will be lost with this person.</p>
<p>Shang Heyu</p>
<p>His art belongs to the Yu Jusheng school. Although his fame does not reach Xiaolou's, in terms of skill, the two have their own strengths and weaknesses. In plays such as "Changban Slope" and "Picking the Carriage," Heyu's voice is restricted by his appearance, so he cannot compare to Xiaolou. But Heyu's learning is precise and his martial arts are outstanding. Plays such as "Siping Mountain" and "Shenting Ridge" are things that Xiaolou cannot achieve. As for "Taking Gaodeng," "Iron Cage Mountain," and other open-face plays, he is calm, steady, and has norms, and can be comparable to Xiaolou. Heyu's character and morality are very noble, he is quiet and doesn't laugh or smile easily, and he is thrifty and doesn't fight for the world. He lived under Li Jirui for many years, and was suppressed in his name, and the yellow bell was destroyed. People cried injustice for him. In his later years, he was heroic and mighty. Last spring, when Xiaolou died, he was persuaded to form a troupe to perform in the old capital. Did he really want to make a comeback? Or was it just the environment that made him do it?</p>
<p>Cheng Jixian</p>
<p>Is the direct grandson of the big boss Cheng Changgeng, a member of the Xiaorongchun Opera School. He is honored as the leading male actor today, with no dispute. His art is complete in both civil and military roles, and his singing and acting are all capable, calling it pure is most appropriate. It is a pity that he did not have the best luck in his old age. Since leaving the Qiusheng Society, his life has been in trouble. Although he once joined Shang Heyu's troupe, his voice was weakened and he was not valued by people, but his skills were steady and his words were clear, and the archetype was still there. He is stubborn and does not follow the trend. Someone once asked him to play Zhou Yu in "Borrowing the East Wind," but he only performed until the stage, because the old play "Heroes' Gathering" does not include borrowing the wind, his stubborn attitude can be seen.</p>
<p>Xiao Changhua</p>
<p>Is a typical modern clown. All the younger generation of comedians respect him as a master. His art has reached perfection, and he is worthy of the name of a comic figure. Jiang Gan in "Heroes' Gathering" has the reputation of a living Ziyi. His posture and expression when stealing the book are subtle and breathtaking. Tang Qin in "Assassination" is vivid and realistic in portraying the frivolous state of a villain, and he can be elegant without being vulgar and rich in scholarship. Single plays such as "Inviting the Doctor," "Lian Sheng Shop," and "Ronghua Ji," and plays with people such as "Little Shang Tomb," "Playing Knife," "Top Scholar's Score," and "Famen Temple," are all brilliant. Xiao is straightforward and tireless in teaching people. The rich depend on him for his right and left hand. He is also a rare artist today.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Starting from Du Shiniang — Ms. Shuliu <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>After watching Chen Yanyan's performance in "Du Shiniang," I was very moved. Although Du Shiniang was a prostitute, she was sincere to Li Jia, not abandoning him in poverty, and willing to be his life and death partner. However, Li Jia had no idea and couldn't recognize people. For fear of his strict father's condemnation, he sold Du Shiniang to their enemy Sun Fu for a thousand taels. Du Shiniang jumped into the river in anger and died. Before her death, she said, "I have hundreds of thousands of pearls and ornaments, and now they are all thrown into the river; but my heart may be more precious than hundreds of thousands of pearls and ornaments." Yes, love is the most precious thing. If Li Jia really loved Shiniang, he should have worked hard to overcome all difficulties. If he was afraid of his father's condemnation, couldn't he have found a way to make a living himself, and had to be dependent? According to what the movie said, after his thousand taels, the blood money for selling his wife, was robbed, couldn't he still make a living by selling his writing? Although it was little more than being a beggar, he was still alive.</p>
<p>The Chinese people value chastity, and divorce is rare after marriage, which is admired by Europeans and Americans, unlike the Europeans and Americans, whose love does not last. Xiong Shiyi's "Wang Baochuan" was a sensation because Wang Baochuan could live a hard life for eighteen years without changing her will. I hope that people who are married or in love will love and understand each other and consolidate the love between husband and wife forever.</p>
<p>The screenwriter was afraid of disappointing the audience, so he specifically had Shiniang rescued and finally reunited. "May all lovers in the world be married," this idea is also very good. (Paid)</p>

<h3 id="e105">A Realistic Description of Shanghai Book Venues <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Yuxiu</p>
<p>Each book venue in Shanghai has its own different characteristics. Here is a brief description of my personal observations for the benefit of fellow enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Huiquanlou Is the oldest, so all its scale follows the old ways. The venues are high on the floor, and the first two buildings have wide glass windows, providing plenty of light and air. The morning show is its characteristic.</p>
<p>Nanyuan The venue is under the building, so the light is darker. It lights up even in the daytime, and the air is slightly poor.</p>
<p>Huyuan From the seller to the waiter, the staff is almost entirely from Changshu, and most of the listeners also speak the Qinchuan accent.</p>
<p>Yalu The venue is not very large, but the location is quiet in the middle of the city, which is most suitable for the taste of the listeners. On the top floor there are speakers and writers, forming an apartment for speakers.</p>
<p>Fengmingqing Three trams and ten buses reach the door, which is the most convenient for transportation, but because it is along the road, the sound is very noisy.</p>
<p>Fuchun There are many homes upstairs, like a beehive, but other facilities are still good.</p>
<p>Longquan It is located in a remote location, at the bottom of the alley, where it is difficult for old listeners to access.</p>
<p>Good Friend The house is the oldest, like a ruined house. In the afternoon, there are dim sums, such as tofu flowers, disc cakes, and most of them are cheap and delicious, which is convenient for the listeners.</p>
<p>Yuminglou Is now the only book hall north of Suzhou River.</p>
<p>Oriental The venue is the largest and there are the most schedules. There is a broadcasting machine on the stage. Men and women do not have separate seats. In addition to Nanjing, there is not much to watch.</p>
<p>Nanjing The book venue is in the form of a theater stage, and men and women do not have separate seats. Glass cups are mostly used, and it is always only a studio, becoming the basic venue for female ballad singing.</p>
<p>Baihuating Only does evening events, with glass table tops and all the layout, which are new tea room faces.</p>
<h3 id="e106">King of Movie Fans <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Bofen</p>
<p>Suppose I ask you: "Who is the king of movie fans?" Can you answer? If not, then I can tell you: The king of movie fans is Ms. Virglnia Clond, a female student in the Film Studies Department of Columbia University in New York.</p>
<p>Ms. Clond's achievement of the title of "King of Movie Fans" is by no means accidental. She spends $250 a year watching movies, without interruption for seven or eight years. She watches all kinds of movies, A-level movies are good, B-level movies are also good, and C-level movies (newsreels and short films) are often watched. Year after year, she has become the champion of movie watching in the United States.</p>
<p>This king of movie fans has an odd habit. She sits in the cinema for more than ten hours at a time without getting tired. She usually watches five movies a day, two in the morning, one after dinner, and two more in the evening, and every Saturday she specializes in watching newsreels and short films.</p>
<p>Her home is located next to the Nemo Cinema at 110 Broadway, New York, so she patronizes this cinema every day.</p>
<p>This king of movie fans believes that "Gone with the Wind" and Frank Lloyd's "Cavalcade" are the two most satisfying films. In the past year, "A Thousand Heroes," "Young Edison," "A Butterfly Dream," and "National Spirit" are unforgettable works.</p>
<p>She opposes Goldwyn's recent "Declaration Against Double Feature Film System" to the film industry.</p>
<p>Paul Mooney, Spencer Tracey, and Vivien Leigh are the movie stars most admired by this king of movie fans.</p>

<p>Since its opening, the Yindu Ballroom at the intersection of Fuxu Road and Weihaiwei Road has been crowded with dancers and business is booming. The ballroom's interior decoration and equipment are completely designed by famous artists, novel and modern, creating a unique style. The orchestra is led by the famous musician Eddie and also employs local and Filipino musicians for accompaniment, which is extremely pleasant and moving. The dancers are all Hong Kong and Shanghai stars with excellent beauty and artistry, and people from all walks of life praise it as a resort, expressing their satisfaction.</p>
