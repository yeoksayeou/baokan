<p>綏西華軍反攻，克五原；鄂東華軍反攻，克麻城；贛北華軍反攻。克靖安奉新，圍安義。進薄南昌；桂南華軍反攻，克同正與左縣，迫南寗近郊；此數者，本月戰績之尤著者也。此外，如山西之長子方面，河南之沁陽力面，湖南之岳陽方面，江蘇之寳應方面，各有劇戰，皆能殺敵致果，俱誌報端，不贅舉。溯自入春以來，華軍之居主動而日軍居被動，已成普遍現象；更烏瞰各方軍情之最近發展形勢，則蔚然有總反攻之觀。聞者色然以喜，奔走相告曰，反攻開始，河山光復之期，其庶幾不遠矣；南昌戰訊，最為視綫所集中。</p>
<p>南昌乃江西省會，得失至足聳動耳目，及今克復，誠堪快意；抑克之終有其日，而終於必克者又豈僅南昌。其實。就軍略與政治種種方面論之，衆人所期待克復之南昌，其價値，其重要性，實屬不如業已克復之五原。更就中日戰爭之全局論之，今日之問題猶不在南昌，亦不在克南昌，乃在攻南昌。謂在攻南昌。猶母寗謂在攻；謂在攻，猶母寗謂在戰。</p>
<p>中國抗戰之始，當局立即昭告人民日，此戰以消耗對方力量為策略；又日，此戰必忍受慘痛犧牲而惟務持久。歷三年以至今茲。顯見當局所持意態之自始準確，亘久而不易。蓋侵略者之野心與暴行，必與其實力成正比例；不能消耗其實力，則暴行不止，野心不戢，即使稍緩其侵略，中國仍無自而獲致確定之勝利與安全。更以侵略者之處心積慮，養精蓄銳，勢難輕撄其鋒；則惟有把握時間，以相周旋；頃刻所不能勝其全力者，累歲月，分其全力以勝之；憑藉無窮之潛力，運用無窮之時間，故得以侵略者經歷三年之窘態，印證持久抗戰之為不二法門。在此意熊之下，攻守進退，自有原則可宗；若乃以慘痛疾苦為藉口，以喪城失地而吹求，蓋無一是者也。侵略者今日豈不追悔其誤陷於中國之策略？故在軍事上更作一二次之新攻勢，以適應其何種局部之企圖，雖屬可能，然謀以軍事完成侵略之全功，則必由迷夢省覺而放棄。窺其所亟，乃在如何確保其據點，化為强固之防綫；堅守其防綫，然後控制軍事佔領點綫內之全面，以逞其政洽經濟種種方面之兼幷陰謀。此則觀之彼在淪陷區域內之凡百佈置，固得證明其慾求；更觀於彼在軍事行動方面大體漸歸沉寂。亦可見其不復作進攻戰勝之想。</p>
<p>中國方面當然不容對於抗戰云云，望文生義而作曲解，不然，侵略者倘若至此為止，不復想進攻，不復想戰勝；則抗戰者豈亦得至此為止，長此對壘而相持？止於相持，不進不退抑且不戰；則侵略者，空間則由點成綫，由綫成面，時間則由今而後，由暫而久而永久。即此亦成為侵略者莫大之成功。抗戰之大義不若是也。抗戰務勝，務全勝；亦必國家主權與領土恢復其完整，始為全勝。於是言之，最近華軍什綏西鄂東贛北桂南之反攻，旣非對於對力攻勢之逆襲，亦非即對於綏鄂贛桂諸省漸次光復；析其最主要之意義所在，日答復對方在軍事行動上之沉寂，曰搖撼其成綫成面之企圖，日注銷其久佔永佔之可能，日警醒其在淪陷區凡百佈置之無聊，如此而已！中國光復失地，必有其日，顧非必今茲。要知中日戰爭雖因中國之勝算而成為持久作戰之局，然按之各種必然之事理，則中國取得最後勝利之方式，當非漸次光復，累歲月以迄於全部光復。蓋對方小至實力消耗垂盡，則無望於其放棄侵略政策；而彼實力未盡之際，中　要在促使消耗，而不在亟謀光復一城一地。消耗對力之這，在於戰。侵略者不復進取，則在於抗戰者之攻。待彼由消耗而筋疲力盡之日。始為中國總反攻制勝之水到渠成之時。</p>

<p>本屆工部局新董事、於昨晨在工部局大厦、舉行就職典禮、共到華董虞洽卿·袁履登·江一平·郭順·奚玉書、英董凱自威·海萊·羅特立克麥唐納·密啟爾·鮑惠爾、美董阿樂滿·卡奈、日董僅到塙雄太郎一人、田誠以在東京、故未出席、各新董舉行就職典禮後、即行推舉本屆總董及副總董、結果凱自威被推為總董、卡奈氏被推為副總董、最後攝影而散、</p>
<p>新總副董　兩人略歷</p>
<p>（一）凱自威氏為英商怡和洋行經理、英國商會會員、放滬已十四載、自一九三六年後、即連任工部局董事、以迄於今，去年工部局總董樊克令氏請假時、其職務即由凱氏代理、其祖其父、早年均在工部局中服務有年、凱氏此次被推為總董、尙屬若干年來阿諾德為工部局總董以後之第一英人、（二）卡奈氏為美孚火油公司上海辦事處副經理、旅滬經商、巳逾二十載、會任工部局董事三載、至冬始因病辭職、今卡奈氏又被推為副總董、蓋因其在工部局中服務、較他人有更悠久之歷史及卓著之成績也、</p>
<p>盛傳日董　田誠辭職</p>
<p>至於日董「華中鐵道公司」董事長田誠、據昨日探悉、在未就職之前、即有提出辭呈之意、昨日日方大陸新報宣稱、田誠已有辭職之意見、惟辭職之原因、則未能獲悉、該報復稱、田誠之辭職、對日僑團體有極大之影響、蓋足以動搖人心也、惟此事尙待田誠自東京返滬後、始可決定、又據日方稱、如田誠辭職後、其繼任者當為岡本一策、蓋在此次競選中、田誠所得票數為五〇二五票、岡本一策為五〇二三票、僅二票之差、且岡本在滬日僑中、亦有相當聲望、又據另一方面稱、此次田誠辭職之動機、蓋因日人在此次競選中、竟吿慘敗、而岡本一策原為工部局董事、此次竟遭落選且田誠為戰事爆發後來滬之「新日僑」、對於上海情形、不如岡本一策之暸如指掌、故田誠提出辭呈、顯有退讓賢路之意、</p>
<p>各方期望　新董殷切</p>
<p>戰後租界行政、因環境特殊、艱鉅繁劇、逈異往昔在此非常情形之下、各方對新董之期望、更為殷切、各方咸盼諸董不論遭遇任何因難、均應竭全力以維護工部局之權益、而物價飛漲、影響民生、尤應從速改善、對制裁奸商、防止囤積居奇、為全市市民一致屬望、應即雷厲執行、</p>
<p>工部局辦　公室變動</p>
<p>工部局總辦處、向設在工部局大厦東部、刻已遷移至北部、即前總裁費信惇辦公處、英副總辦葛勃、與現任總裁兼總辦費利溥合併辦公、華副總辦何德奎·日副總辦指宿·會辦那煦·等辦公室、仍設在東部、總董辦公室、改設在前葛勃辦公室、</p>
<p>福蘭善氏　即將退休</p>
<p>工部局情報室主任英人福蘭善、在局服務、歷十餘年、繼賽亞氏任情報室主任、亦歷七年、刻聞福氏將於下月一日起退休、新主任將由英人奧克納爾繼任、輿氏現已在情報室服務、</p>
<p>租界行政　必須改善</p>
<p>明日出版之密勒氏評論報刋有社評云、日人在此次工部局董事競選中、巳被完全擊敗、上海情勢、亦因是而更趨緊張、作者深信上海居民、雖贊成租界行政有改善之必要、但渠等決不願假諸日人之手、似達此目的、又稱、在任何被日人侵佔之城市中、日人政續之敗壞、已為不可諱言之事實、上海居民祇須赴滬西越界　路地帶（即日人與偽方所管轄之「歹土」）作一次巡視即可信吒言不虛、</p>

<p>投機商時出時進</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近漲〇六二五、遠亦〇六二五、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、滙兌英對美·滬·法等各滙俱平、美對英跌一角、對滬小五分、對法降二五、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價英金四辦士一二五、美滙五元九六八七五、較隔昨晚盤、英美均平、開後投機商與銀行進出不一、市面微呈硬化、計投機商吸進外行五月份美滙五元六八七五、而外行納人投機商五月份美滙、則為五元七一八七五、至現貨美滙外行會對做價為六元、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉大〇·五〇、此後市况依然平靜、仍以外行互做交易居多、投機商亦略有售出、投機商賣予有利四月份英金四辦士〇六二五、外行對做五月份美滙、價為五元七八一二五、迨至午刻、賣出頭寸稍减、勢已轉穩、結果午收價現貨英金四辦士一二五、美滙五元九六八七五、四月份英金四辦士〇四六八七五、美滙五元八七五、五月份英金三辦士八九〇六二五、美滙五元六五六二五、較之晨開、現貨英美俱無變動、期貨亦少差別、</p>

<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况復趨疲跌、南昌克復之說、未能證實、而銀根加緊、使多方無處覓取頭寸、銀行拆息過高、又加一層東縛、四底比期轉　即屆、債市影響尤甚、即無其他搖言、暫時亦不易看好、昨日經過、上午初開、市價穩定、澗利及益員補空、惟德孚協大通記等實貨逐步流出、價乃緩緩下墜、雖有同成鴻康及零星散戶補進、但同廣泰豐怡泰等又有脫貨求財之舉、故午收行市、未能立定、午後賣氣尤湧、恒康永康聯和大數賣出、協興元潤利補空、益昌協大聯益稍有吃進、鴻大先進後又復出、四十一號入丙出甲天生信昌元錩胡鶴記等仍有賣出、戊種打破五十元、丙種會退入九元關、丁種九元亦敲破、結果比前日一致回小四角至五角半、成交總數共計約一百二十萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交大中華火柴股一百股、價為二十五元半、</p>
<p>衆業股市開盤、浮多了結者仍絡繹、但此風不久即止、於是多方又肆活躍、羣起在進、市况浸淫在購買氛圈中、有數種漲風劇烈逾恒、</p>
<p>會德豐與鋼業股在上漲各股中、堪稱「衆星之星」、上海銀公司國際揚子等股跟進亦速、會德豐以一百七十八元開盤、經一度望旋後、買者忽來競購、霎那間飛團至二百元、嗣又起伏於五六元之盤價內、下午另有引起購買在濤、價格直跳至二百零四元、但收盤即吿平息、二百零一元有買戶、鋼業股昨已打破前此一切高價紀錄、開盤三十二元二五、開後盤旋、移時亦在霎那間騰躍至三十七元七五、晚收三十七元買進、三十七元二五賣出、上海銀公司開盤價祇三十元、經大量成交後、價亦無礙直前、收價為三十三元買進、三十三元半賣出、</p>
<p>午時接華盛頓電訊、謂「美政府對荷屬東印度問題即使荷蘭被擲捲入歐戰漩渦、亦必須維持現狀」、此訊使一般人對於　不振響之橡皮股、突起競購之念、價格以是甚有進展、</p>

<p>上日狂落之紗市、昨（十八日）則又復回升、實因現貨缺乏、根子愈緊、至於內地雖有需路、苦無現貨可得、故虛弱之人心、突然轉挺、近來市面在跌猛漲、使人可畏、有人說、本報調查棉紗運往杳港之數量、約計有二萬包之外、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、氣勢尙屬和平、且某大戶乘虛來甩出、壓低市盤、再行拖進、故市盤始疲繼漲、開價二十支雙馬廠單價為一千三百二十五元、賣出幾十包、此時客幫亦觀望而不動、但廿三支金鷄紗售價已貴到一千五百外、尙無現貨、又聞布市大漲、某某等復來收進、市盤得此推動、一霎間突然上騰、二十支雙馬廠單價為一千三百八十五元、現貨昂至一千三百九十五元、查半日間成交統計二千二百二十包、行情二十支雙馬現貨漲五十八元、</p>
<p>午後又有持殊風浪、紗市人心又復在熾、二十支雙馬現貨聽說一千四百二十元、做開幾包、尙有買不到之說、此種變幻莫測之情形、無從捉摸、要之為投機份子掀風作浪也茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>

<p>本棉交易、較前减色、市態平平、不及紗市之挺括、因銷路仍狹、不過午後梢帶昂象、茲將現棉成交情形列左、</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初殊為活　而堅定、後又因大衆之購買及一部份之空頭抵補、但結果回疲、收盤價格較之上日漲四五磅音、印度棉市昨日連同預測降落二羅比、埃及棉市漲二十餘磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日繼續活躍異常、期貨交易雖有所聞、但總不若現貨之活躍也、同業間頗有搜購四十二支原料者、市上對於此類原棉奇缺故目前長纖維較一般原料為俏俐、茲將昨日棉市以美滙五元九三七五折合送廠價如下、</p>

<p>米市自前朝稍受挫折後、各貨行情雖尙無甚上落、但人局因此見疲、昨晨初開、原根客販、猶無出售之意、而銷塲無論內地客戶本鄉店胃、又見機而作、同時浮囤散戶等一般心思家、素以搶鋒為本領、當此市面恒多劇烈變化、即將獲利貨粉紛脫出、所以早間回籠貨頗見充斥、小絞祇四十二元半、較之前盤已眨近元、不過一跌後又能引起客戶、店胃一見形勢活動、亦即繼之添辦、去路頓廣、喊聲即起、市局乃又一反疲態、轉星帶緊、頃刻恢復原盤、然大勢不健、一動即懈、且如客販至此、又都乘高推出、致一些回風、遭變重環境壓迫之下、頓無立足餘地、陣陣後退、各貨行情再度下降、從此一路疲軟、卒乏回頭之機會、結果貶落六七角不一、計收盤一號西買為四十七元、火紋四十六元、小絞四十三元、僅米茶與混合碎以市貨無多、未有上落、站守原盤耳、</p>
<p>粳糯國米、因天雨到貨轉稀、祇共一千餘包、所以粳米塲外曙盤、聞無變化、與前相仿、獨糯米因邇來洋米連朝飛漲、市價標準距離失常、低廉已極、殊較他貨便宜、引起大戶繼續國收、及糕舖飯擔之暢銷、形勢反緊、行情提高元砠、若澳特元售開四十一元、他如常丹貨亦已三十八九元、</p>
<p>洋米又有到滬前日（十六日）法國郵船公司不定期輪、由西貢運來洋米九百二十噸、計包米八十噸、業已起卸完竣、該輪昨晨離滬赴日、昨日有怡和洋行定生輪、自香港運來洋米一千四白四十七包、昨晨進口、停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、並有原船運津之洋米四千五百三十六包、又太古公司江蘇輪、昨午抵埠、亦自香港運來洋米一千六百五十九包、聞渣華公司芝波沙號輸、在西貢裝載大批洋米米滬、大約下星期一（二十二日可到、（祖）</p>
<p>洋米昨市升降互見，回籠　貨連日被北幫與華內外大戶吸收、昨日產　又復報漲、貨方喊高於前、囤戶放　於俊、四五月份二號西貢開價五十三元半　、頓被放加半元至五十四元、旋又自五十四元一角二角大至五十四元三角半、買氣活潑、不亞於交易所時代之熱鬧、市面上落、並不完全依據事實、只須買戶貪辦、市價立又挨步直上、盡洋米市面早被投機者視為惟一目的物矣、故至午後獲和出籠、　又自五十四元一二角降至五十四元收價、現米實消　淡、獲利者亦有吐出、且昨傳被扣之挪輪裝米已在港轉運來申、人心轉定、售價初站旣落、結果反小二三角、</p>

<p>小麥交易、又趨沉靜、蓋自前兩日一度鬆落後、貨方以存到兩枯、及洋麥定價昂貴、即有扳持之意、而昨日粉價猛緊、麥市更被激起、惟目下廠客需要不暢、大致擇宜而取、故雙方勢難接近、市面又呈擯局、</p>

<h3 id="c110">百分之四十五與一倍 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— 維塞</p>
<p>此次公共汽車再度增價，表面上看由每站四分漲至五分，即增原來車資四分之一，似乎并不過分；但事實上該公司卻增加了一倍的車資，說起來未免令人不相信，而報章上也未注意這一點，現在我以事實為證：</p>
<p>在十五號以前，一站車資為四分，二站為五分，三站為六分工；現在怎樣呢？一站五分，二站卻跳到八分，三要跳到一角二分；與原來的六分相較，不是相差一倍嗎？我每天在福煦路同孚路口，乘九路公共汽車到憶定盤路，剛好三站，車資六分。但現在是漲到一角二分了。我們的收入何曾像這樣的一漲就是一倍？</p>
<p>上海這兩年來，各物都在不斷的上漲，但像公共汽車一漲就是百分之一百，實在太駭人；而表面上還聲明只漲百分之四十五。</p>
<p>「增價」已經是「旣成事實」了吧？但是百分之四十五與一倍之間，希望公司當局細細調查一下這張「價目表」，這至低的要求，我們等着誠實的答覆的。</p>
<h3 id="c111">帶着疾病活命 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— 陳鑫奎</p>
<p>偌大一個上海，名義上雖擁有四百萬左右的人口，實際上如能仔細調查一番，恐怕可以合乎健康標準的市民，不見得會超過半數，如此說來，就有二百多萬的市民，已在帶着疾病茍延性命了。</p>
<p>僅是吃得下飯，肚裏不脹，并不能說已是一個健康人。所謂不折不扣的健康人，除了條件不說，於身體方面：如四肢，軀幹，骨骼，頭腦，臟腑，神經，血液，肌肉，皮膚，毛髪及指爪等全部器官或關節，都須健全靈活，沒有絲毫缺憾。牙齒常要發痛或著晚來足趾必癢的人，固然不能認為健康，即表面上略無病容，祗是做事不耐久勞，易感倦怠，和食量多寡不定，夜間睡眠不足的人們，也不能歸入健康這一類。</p>
<p>帶着疾病活命的人們，不但肉體上蒙受痛苦，而且精神上感覺威脋。試問在痛苦和威脋下過活的日子，還有什么愉快可說？當然，沒有一個人是甘願帶着疾病活性命的。現在社會上抱病過日子的人多，不外三個緣由：（一）身體上某部分器官已有損害，自己卻尚未發覺；（二）自知本身已有某部分組織發生障礙，然自恃抵抗力強旺而滿不在乎；（三）明知本人病況嚴重，可是衣食逼人，無力請教醫生，祗好坐視病狀日日加重，聽天由命。</p>
<p>關於上述第一種人，若肯不時嚴密的檢驗體格，接受醫生的指導，或服藥，或調養，健康的恢復最為容易。關於第二種人，倘能請醫診察，疾病也易於解除；否則諱疾忌醫，等於慢性自殺，早晚將自食其報。至於第三種有病而無力求醫的人，在病人中要佔最大多數。他們的處境最堪寄與同情，不幸現世的社會，是以拜金主義為基礎的，不論醫院，醫師，藥房，藥局，都以求得金錢為最大目的，至多祗把人道主義做做照牌而已。所以貧而病者，很少與醫藥接觸的可能，就是有那些慈善性質的診治，完全免費的機會也很少，且在治療方面也不很澈底有效。</p>
<p>「人」旣有生存的自由，便應該有健康的自由，眼前人類僅有「生病的自由」而已。</p>
<h3 id="c112">新的刺激 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— 不仁</p>
<p>「朱門酒肉臭，路有凍死骨」現在的上海正如這兩句話的寫照。各大酒菜館裏，是每天高朋滿座，一百元一席菜還算是普通的讌客，而每天等上幾個鐘頭去領取兩個饅頭的「人類的渣滓」據說在三個月中，達一百八十八萬人；更因為連兩個饅頭都抓不着而餓死凍死的，看了普善山荘每天開出來的卡車都滿載而歸，這數字也可以不必去統計了。</p>
<p>然而在這極少數的一部份人士還在呼籲，救濟之外，大家似乎都沒有看到（不是近視，而是不願意浪費他們的「目力」），他們每天在賭場，舞廳，戲院中送走悠悠然的二十四小時；可是我們仍能聽到他們喊着「寂寞」，因為他們需要新的刺激。</p>
<p>自然，這「寂寞」是得設法解決的，譬如有一天會關起門來，坐在沙發上捧着叭兒狗玩個痛快，那末，人的戲看得膩了，看看狗的戲當然也是調劑之道，而況當年「海京伯」的盛況還在腦膜上印着很深的印象呢。於是牛肉五百磅，蔬菜三十擔，雞五百隻，使人興奮起來，因為從這每天的食量上看來，在沙發上玩玩叭兒狗，又膛乎其後了。</p>
<p>掄起指頭來算算日子，大槪就在目前了，不過這巨大的消耗，或者會逼使餓肚皮的人滾到「馬」肚下去自盡也說不定，這「戲外戲」能不能說是煞風景呢，因為這是他們所不願意看到的。</p>
<h3 id="c113">片面蛋 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— 力人</p>
<p>最近我們包的一家包飯作常拿蛋來做菜肴，起初我們喜歡得很，因為它滋補而且美味啊！但是後來差不多每餐皆有蛋，這就啟我們的疑了。因為現在蛋須值一角餘一隻，包飯做決不會拿這種高價的東西餐餐給我們吃的，後來我問那挑飯的人，他起初只是笑而不答，後來我再三問他，他說：這是向餅乾公司買的蛋黃，價格便宜得很。嗄！包飯作原來使着這麼的巧計啊！你想，蛋白質旣被餅乾公司抽去用作製餅乾之用，那末這渣滓豈非毫無益處。現在物價高貴，這當然使包飯作偷工減料，但是我們不一定要吃葷菜，吃這種「片面蛋」，我們寗可吃青菜豆腐。</p>
<h3 id="c114">耶穌的感謝槪念　（三） <a href="#c114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>耶穌就是這樣，當末次聚晚餐之時，他緊緊拿起杯來祝謝，他知道前途崎嶇難行，也知道是到榮耀獎賞之道，因為此去，可使他得着永生。耶穌以快樂的態度，應付人生一切困苦守望，百折不回，始終不變，這是他的人格所以偉大，感謝心所以生的原因。以賽亞四十五章二節說，「我要將嚕中的財寶賜給你，」這個，「你，」是指古列說的。意思就是說，古列由橫逆得到榮耀的勝利。從這句話，我們可以想到，凡肯奮鬥的人，在他人生道上，能發現出許多的寶藏。這就是十字架和各各他的福音。其中有文字之美，有生命之力。英國大詩家鄧生從經驗中寫了這幾句話；人生不是怠惰之鑛，乃是一種鐵鑛，從黑暗中，去採掘，用熱淚去陶冶，以打擊去煅煉。他本人就是這樣煅煉出來的一位大詩家。一個　歡的人，由于努力應付和克服他的橫逆環境，往往會變成一個大有靈力的人世上最有感謝心的人，就是那肯應付人生困苦，受人生一切煅煉的人，他們且能看明在人生黑暗處，有無盡的寶藏，由于所經歷的種種折磨，他心靈深處，由然生起一種自信心和喜悅，使他平凡的生活，變化成有意義的生活，不幸之中，能產生感謝精神。所以，我們必須有應付人生的經驗，然後，我們纔會有真正的感謝心。現在有無數人遵難，看不出可感謝之處，但由於這種不幸，他們可找得真正的財寶，我們當為此感謝，效法耶穌為受苦感謝上帝。在感謝中，我們可得着人生勝利的勇敢。（完）　如欲祥細研究請函郵箱一二二七號</p>

<p>第廿三回　舊侶新儔文章有價　名區勝地管領得人</p>
<p>且說翟無雙因為談及他們報館裏的副業，分出刋物非刋物兩種。刋物中，他們有各種期刋雜誌，有單行本書籍，有中外地圖等等，每年的收入，在刋物上，也就不少。當時的吳君素便問道：「那末屬於非刋物的呢？」翟無雙道：「屬於非刋物的，也有多種。近來我們的電影事業，也非常發達呀！」翟無雙說到那裏，指着邵慧華道：「噯！我倒忘懷了！還有我們這位電影明星在座咧。」邵慧華道：「好！好！不要亂說了！講你的吧。」翟無雙道：「其實我們并不開什麼電影公司，我們也不拍什麼電影戲劇，我們所攝的電影，大槪是短片居多。如關於風景的，關於學術的，關於工業的，關於風俗的，一槪都稱之為新聞片。起初拍了幾捲片子，原不過放映給我們自己報館裏人看看的。後來也有人借了去放映，漸漸的傳到外面去了，別處地方，都來徵求。我們報館裏，就索性設立了一個電影部。凡春秋佳日，全國各處開什麼游覽會，運動會，博覽會，競技會，音樂會等等，我們便派人去攝取電影。此外如有學術上的發明，須以電影表現的。又或關於國內的大工業，如巨舶下水，大橋落成，飛機競賽，鑛山寫實，我們也都去攝了電影。至於各邊疆，各內地的風俗片，也已攝得不少，這是民俗調查會所委讬的。所以近來每一種新聞片攝成以後，各處都有徵求，也有預先定好的，也有臨時購求的。大槪我們製就一種新聞影片，就要印有不少拷貝。所以我們關於電影新聞的那一種副業，倒也很為發達咧。另外還有一種副業，叫做代理部，這個代理部的設立，也是逐漸成功的。起初只是有幾位著作家，出了幾部自印的著作，讬我們報館裏代售。後來又有幾位發明家，發明了幾種關於科學上的新器物，因為自己不合算特設發行部，也讬了我們報館代為發行。這都是為了友誼的關係，答應他們的。誰知後來讬我們代理的事業，越弄越多了，人家都信讬我們。不得已只得另設了一個代理地方，另外派有了幾位職員，還設立了一個樣子間咧。」(二六五）</p>

<p>— 錫森</p>
<p>據天津通訊，最近金少山在中國大戲院出演，與言慧珠周瑞安合作，座券最高價一元六角，而覇王別姬一劇，則臨時加券資三角，海報貼出，座券爭售一空云云。金覇王今日之聲勢，洵足奪人，誠非侷促南中時所可比儗者矣！</p>
<p>覇王一角，武生飾者，自楊老將作古後，當以周瑞安爲首屈一指，瑞安神情工架，雖不若老將渾　，嗓音雖不如老將淸脆，顧身材雄偉，作派大方，却亦不失爲典型之選，故都坤伶演別姬，十九以瑞安配覇王，則可見瑞安於覇王一角，亦最所擅長矣。其次當推孫毓堃，毓堃於民十八九之間，會與雪艷琴合演別姬，爾時毓堃正當盛時，楊老將且許爲能傳衣缽弟子，後此雖一度幾瀕沒落，自老將作古後，毓堃頗有意振作，則以武生而飾覇王，瑞安而外，繼老將而起者，毓堃實大有希望也。</p>
<p>後起武生中，高盛麟藝雖不弱，惜身材較小，飾覇王似非所宜，聞童伶傳德威演此，故都評劇界謂爲有「小覇王中之覇王」氣派，則此子前途，或亦可造材也。</p>
<p>凈角飾覇王，自以金少山爲最著，金外劉連榮藝亦不弱，嗓音極佳，惜身材不如金之雄偉，故與梅博士合演時，恒須借重厚底靴，後起中袁世海亦以演覇王成名，次之如孫盛文，蘇連漢，雖能平穩無疵，以視少山，不逮蓋已遠甚，宜少山以覇王睥睨劇壇，目無餘子，增加券資者，非無因矣。至若陳富瑞之油覇王，趙德鈺之奶覇王，葉盛茂之軟覇王，坤伶王慶奎，張子壽之女覇王，崑班侯益隆之老覇王則近乎胡鬧，未免唐突英雄矣！釋迦牟尼開攝新華攝製約</p>

<p>釋迦牟尼開攝　新華攝製約「雁門關」，業已完成，現將籌備開拍「釋迦牟尼」，內定三個月後率領外景隊赴印度實地攝取佛國風光。女主角原定陳雲裳，現在恐有變動，擬請環游全球的武術家郞德山之幼女莎妮担任，據說莎妮小姐長長的臉蛋，高高的鼻子，而體格頎長，頗具西洋人的風姿，更可賽貴的，她擅長於古典舞藝，這正是「釋迦牟尼」中所需要的。聞莎妮頗有意一登銀幕，不過她不能操純熟的國語，這或許是談判前途的一個障礙</p>
<p>雲裳電滬請假陳雲裳原定本月二十左右返滬，但昨有電報致張善琨，要求緩期，因在港攝製之片尙未完成，但並未註明何片，據記者所知，陳在港主演者爲「風流皇后」。（梁紅王」尙在籌備中。張給復電尤其稍綏數日。</p>

<p>戰太平的華雲是花雲之誤　（下）</p>
<p>無如自道姓名的劇中人偏花而不華」，衡情度理，絕對不許把自己的姓氏弄錯。所以非以陰平唱出花字音不可，有人說古字「花華」「景影」「史事」不分，景孤血，倘我稱他們為影梅九、影孤血，那恐怕是要捱駡的。史可法我寫為事可法，就更要打手心了。當我初談「戰太平」的時候，本想就把「花華」的錯誤，更正一番，不過那時我因為要保存「將華雲」三字的好腔，恐怕字的陰陽一改，腔就變了，未免可惜。誰知經過好多天的揣摹研究之下，竟覺行唱花　音反而格外動聽，只不過把華字下的一個啊字虛音，變成在花字下三個啊　虛音，唱時由下而上，再自高轉低，（即一與三兩啊字低，中間一字高也。）又出花字音時，由低緩而高促，末一啊字虛音一出即接唱雲字，不特姓不錯，字不倒，抑且低迥有為，蒼勁中含有一發即收之妙。至若前段「別家」時之「叫花安與父帶坐騎」安字下使　調，尤以出花字音為宜，倘唱華字，則安字下之　調，即使不出矣，質之高明，以為何如？</p>

He stayed for four months and left Moscow in January, staying in another small town for some time, and returned to China last month. Zhou's arm still needs massage treatment and he cannot write. This arm will probably not be as it used to be. Zhou will come to Chongqing soon. This trip to Moscow was purely for medical treatment. Apart from visiting a few factories and meeting with doctors and nurses in the hospital, he did not have contact with others. The Soviet people are deeply concerned about news from China. Soviet newspapers have opened special columns to publish Chinese war reports. Some believe that Zhou Enlai exchanged views with Soviet leaders on CCP affairs and the overall situation in China while in the Soviet Union, but Ms. Deng denied this.

<h3 id="e21">Counterattacking Nanchang and the War of Resistance <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The Suiyuan Chinese army counterattacked and captured Wuyuan; the Hubei Chinese army counterattacked and captured Macheng; the Ganbei Chinese army counterattacked and captured Jing'an and Fengxin, and besieged Anyi, advancing on Nanchang; the Guinan Chinese army counterattacked and captured Tongzheng and Zuoxian, pressing on the outskirts of Nanning. These are the most prominent war achievements of this month. In addition, there have been fierce battles in the Changzi area of Shanxi, the Qinyang area of Henan, the Yueyang area of Hunan, and the Baoying area of Jiangsu, all of which have been able to kill the enemy and achieve results, and are recorded in the newspapers, so they will not be listed in detail. Since the beginning of spring, it has become a common phenomenon that the Chinese army has been on the offensive and the Japanese army has been on the defensive. Furthermore, a bird's-eye view of the recent development of military affairs on all sides gives the impression of a general counterattack. Those who heard this were filled with joy and ran to tell each other: "The counterattack has begun, and the day when our rivers and mountains are restored is not far away!" The news of the battle for Nanchang is the most focused on.</p>
<p>Nanchang is the capital of Jiangxi Province, and its gains and losses are enough to stir up attention. Now that it has been recovered, it is truly gratifying. Moreover, there will eventually be a day to recover it, and it is not only Nanchang that must be recovered in the end. In fact, in terms of military strategy and politics, the value and importance of Nanchang, which everyone expects to be recovered, is not as good as Wuyuan, which has already been recovered. Furthermore, in terms of the overall situation of the Sino-Japanese War, the problem today is not in Nanchang, nor in recovering Nanchang, but in attacking Nanchang. To say that it is in attacking Nanchang is not necessarily to say that it is in attacking; to say that it is in attacking is not necessarily to say that it is in fighting.</p>
<p>At the beginning of China's War of Resistance, the authorities immediately announced to the people that this war would use the strategy of consuming the enemy's strength, and that this war would inevitably endure painful sacrifices and only seek to be protracted. Three years have passed, and it is clear that the authorities have maintained an attitude that is accurate from the beginning and has not changed for a long time. The ambition and brutality of the aggressor must be directly proportional to its strength. If its strength cannot be consumed, its brutality will not stop and its ambition will not be curbed. Even if it slightly slows down its aggression, China will still have no way to achieve a definite victory and security. Furthermore, given the aggressor's premeditation and accumulation of strength, it is difficult to lightly engage its sharp edge. Therefore, it is only possible to seize time and deal with it in a circumspect manner. What cannot be won with all its strength at the moment can be won by dividing its strength over the years. Relying on infinite potential and utilizing infinite time, the aggressor has been able to experience the embarrassment of the past three years, confirming that a protracted war of resistance is the only way. Under this intention, there are principles to follow in attack, defense, advance, and retreat. As for using the excuse of pain and suffering, and making demands based on the loss of cities and land, none of this is correct. Does the aggressor not regret today that it was mistakenly trapped in China's strategy? Therefore, it is possible that it will make one or two new offensives in military terms to adapt to its various local intentions, but to complete the entire task of aggression through military means, it must awaken from its delusions and give up. What it is most eager to do is to ensure its strongholds and turn them into solid defense lines; to firmly defend its defense lines and then control the entire area within the military occupation points and lines, in order to carry out its conspiracies of annexation in political and economic terms. This can be proven by observing all its arrangements in the occupied areas. Furthermore, it can be seen from the fact that it has generally become silent in terms of military action that it no longer intends to win by offensive warfare.</p>
<p>Of course, China cannot allow for a misinterpretation of the War of Resistance by taking the words at face value. Otherwise, if the aggressor were to stop here, no longer wanting to attack or win, then could the resistance fighters also stop here, maintaining this stalemate for a long time? Stopping at a stalemate, neither advancing nor retreating, and even not fighting, would become a great success for the aggressor. The great meaning of the War of Resistance is not like this. The War of Resistance must win, and must win completely. It is only when the country's sovereignty and territory are restored to their integrity that it can be called a complete victory. Therefore, in recent years, the Chinese army in Suiyuan, E'dong, Ganbei, and Guinan has launched a counterattack, which is neither a counterattack against a force of aggression, nor is it a gradual restoration of the provinces of Sui, E, Gan, and Gui. Analyzing its most important significance lies in responding to the opponent's silence in military action, shaking its attempt to form lines and surfaces, canceling its possibility of long-term occupation, and reminding it of the futility of all its arrangements in the occupied areas. That's all! China will definitely have a day to recover its lost territories, but not necessarily now. It should be known that although the Sino-Japanese War has become a long-term war due to China's chances of winning, according to various inevitable reasons, the way in which China achieves final victory should not be a gradual restoration, accumulating years to the point of complete restoration. The reason is that the other side will not abandon its policy of aggression until its strength is exhausted. When its strength is not exhausted, China's main task is to promote consumption, not to seek to recover a city or a place in a hurry. The key to consuming strength lies in battle. If the aggressor no longer advances, it lies in the attack of those who resist. The day when it is exhausted by consumption will be the time when China's general counteroffensive and victory will be achieved.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Hull Issues Statement: Dutch East Indies Must Maintain Status Quo; US Adopts Tough Policy on Far East, Warns Signatory Nations to Respect Promises <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Washington: US Secretary of State Hull issued a statement yesterday saying, "Any change to the status quo of the Dutch East Indies will harm the stability, peace, and security of the Pacific." In commenting on the statement made on Sunday by Japanese Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita regarding the Dutch East Indies, Hull stated, "The East Indies are extremely important to the entire Pacific international relations." After pointing out the importance of the economic nature of the islands, he said, for the benefit of all nations, the status quo of the archipelago must be maintained. Hull stated, "I am very interested in the statement made by the Japanese Foreign Minister that the Japanese government is extremely concerned about maintaining the status quo of the Dutch East Indies. Any change to the status quo of the Dutch East Indies will directly affect the interests of many countries. The Dutch East Indies are extremely important to the entire Pacific international relations. The East Indies stretch approximately 3,200 miles from west to east, from the Indian Ocean in the west to the Pacific Ocean in the east, straddling the equator. The East Indies are also a key element of global commerce. They produce a large proportion of the world's major commodities, such as rubber, tin, quinine, copra, etc. Many countries, including the United States, need these products. Interference in the internal affairs of the Dutch East Indies or changing the status quo of the islands by non-peaceful means will not only harm the stability, peace, and security of the Dutch East Indies but will also harm the stability, peace, and security of the entire Pacific. This conclusion is based on universally accepted principles and is strongly advocated by our country. It is also included in the exchange of notes between the United States and Japan on November 30, 1908, in which the United States and Japan stated their respective policies on maintaining the status quo in the Pacific region. Subsequently, the United States, Britain, France, and Japan signed a treaty in Washington on December 13, 1921, regarding the islands and territories belonging to the countries in the Pacific region. On February 4, 1922, the four countries sent a note to the Netherlands stating, 'Each of the countries has decided to respect the rights of the Netherlands over the islands in the Pacific region.' In recent years, all peace-loving countries have sincerely requested the abandonment of the policy of force and the maintenance of peace based on major principles. These major principles include respecting the rights of other countries, not interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, granting other countries equal and fair treatment, and respecting treaty promises. Treaty revisions should be carried out in an orderly manner when necessary. The United States government has always hoped, as have other peace-loving countries, that the attitudes and policies of all countries can be based on the aforementioned principles and that these principles can be applied not only to every part of the Pacific region but also to every part of the world." (United Press, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington: Regarding the Dutch East Indies issue, the statement made by Japanese Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita has been recorded and sent to the State Department by the Japanese Embassy. At the same time, the US Embassy in Japan has also recorded and sent Secretary of State Hull's statement, which is a kind of response to Arita's statement, to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington: Secretary of State Hull's statement has been commented on by diplomatic circles, who said that although the wording is very mild, it is a clear warning to Japan and other countries that may take advantage of the Netherlands' crisis and attempt to seize the East Indies. However, examining the content of the statement, it expresses agreement with the principle of maintaining the status quo put forward by Foreign Minister Arita, but at the same time, it also clearly condemns Japan's threatening interference. It can be asserted that if Japan seeks to place the Dutch East Indies, which is also the source of industrial raw materials for the United States, under protection, the United States will immediately take various measures to deal with it. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>New York: Today, the newspapers here all put US Secretary of State Hull's warning to Japan regarding the Dutch East Indies issue at the top of the news about the European war. The newspapers' editorials all believe that Hull's statement is an indication of a hardening of the United States' Far East policy. The New York Times said, "Secretary of State Hull's quick statement of the United States' position to Japanese Foreign Minister Arita shows that the United States' policy toward the Pacific has hardened." The New York Herald Tribune said that Arita's statement, from Washington's point of view, is by no means a doubt that Britain and the United States will take action, but a justification for Japan to take the same steps as Germany. This is because Washington observes that Japan is thinking of taking advantage of Germany's occupation of the Netherlands to occupy the Dutch East Indies. (United Press, 18th)</p>
<p>The Hague: Although the official circles here are seeking criticism of US Secretary of State Hull's statement on the Dutch East Indies issue, the non-official circles are extremely welcoming. (United Press, 18th)</p>
<p>The Netherlands Resolves to Defend All Territories by Force</p>
<p>Paris: The Dutch government notified the Foreign Ministry here yesterday that the Netherlands will deal with any invasion of any territory of the Dutch Empire with strong force. The Dutch government also said that Japan and other signatory countries to the Washington Conference have clearly guaranteed that the Dutch East Indies will not be invaded. French sources here believe that the statement made by the Japanese Foreign Ministry expressing concern about the fate of the Dutch East Indies if the Netherlands is invaded is a tentative expression, and the Dutch government has now given the above-mentioned response, which will make Tokyo hesitate before advancing south. (United Press, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington: Dutch Minister Loudon recently had contact with the State Department authorities, and afterwards said that no matter who tries to place any part of our country under protection, this is not acceptable to our country. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Dutch Ambassador to Japan visited Foreign Minister Arita at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 3 pm on the 18th, and based on instructions from his government, stated that they do not want to rely on any country's protection now, nor will they rely on other countries in the future, and refuse any country's proposal for protection or interference. (Domei News Agency, 18th) Several newspapers in Washington here expressed concern about the future of the Dutch East Indies in the event that the Netherlands is drawn into the war. The Washington Post said that Japanese Foreign Minister Arita's remarks on Sunday were a unilateral declaration of Japan's development policy. If the Dutch East Indies were to adopt military and economic policies and be occupied by a country like Japan, the sources of rubber and tin supply would be endangered, which is something the United States cannot afford to ignore. The Times Herald said that it is doubtful whether the United States can protect the Dutch East Indies from Japan's determined seizure. The United States cannot even defend the Philippines, let alone the more distant Dutch East Indies. If the Netherlands cannot defend it and Britain cannot defend it, then the United States will have to stand by and do nothing. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: A Tokyo dispatch says that Foreign Minister Arita reported on the situation in Northern Europe, the attitude taken by the United States, and the position held by the Japanese government on the Dutch East Indies at the Privy Council today. (18th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: A Japanese naval spokesman said today that the Japanese Navy is as concerned as the Japanese government about the status quo of the Dutch East Indies, because if the status quo of the Dutch East Indies changes due to the impact of the European war, it would mean the expansion of the European war to the Far East. The spokesman also pointed out that the South Seas islands are economically very important to Japan, so the natural resources of these places must be developed by various means. Japan has no territorial demands in the South Seas. When discussing the "lightning" development of the European situation, the spokesman also said that it is needless to talk about how Japan will encounter in the near future. He also said that the United States wants to maintain the status quo of Greenland because the United States has interests there, but the United States' interests in Greenland cannot be compared to Japan's interests in the Dutch East Indies.

<h3 id="e23">US Congress to Pass Naval Expansion Bill; Admiral Stark Reaffirms Request to Increase Strength by 25%; New 35,000-Ton Battleship to Be Launched in June <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Washington: The Vinson Bill, which stipulates an 11% increase in the US Navy, seems certain to be approved by the Naval Affairs Committee and submitted to the Senate. It is said that the US Navy originally planned to increase by 25%, but the reason for the reduction to 11% is entirely because the arsenals cannot manufacture cannons exceeding the increased 11% within the timeframe of the Vinson Bill. News from Japan that the country is building super battleships will undoubtedly help the passage of the US naval expansion bill in Congress. However, well-informed sources do not believe that Japan can complete the shipbuilding process as rumored. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington: US Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark told the Senate Naval Affairs Committee yesterday that it would cost US$3,486,000,000 to make the US Navy the largest in the world. Stark reaffirmed his request to increase the strength of the US Navy by 25%. It is said that the maximum tonnage of future battleships seems to be limited to 40,000 tons. In the past six months, naval authorities have been vigorously studying the construction of battleships, from 40,000 tons to 70,000 tons. (United Press, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington: US Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark delivered a speech to the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, advocating the expansion of the Navy and Air Force. He mentioned the success of the German Air Force in the Norwegian campaign. He declared that German Junkers aircraft transported 2,000 German soldiers to Norway from Denmark every day. He insisted that the Navy should have the assistance of the Air Force. He demanded the construction of the "world's strongest navy." The Navy's supplementary program stipulates the construction of three aircraft carriers, totaling 85,600 tons, fourteen cruisers, totaling 275,000 tons, sixty-eight destroyers, totaling 242,830 tons, and thirty-six submarines, totaling 57,856 tons. (Haitong News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>New York: Rear Admiral Woodward, commander of the Third Naval District of the naval shipyard, announced yesterday that the new 35,000-ton battleship "North Carolina" will be launched on June 13th. This is the first giant ship built by the United States in nineteen years. Rear Admiral Woodward said in a speech yesterday that the United States should expand its unparalleled naval and air power, "At the current rate of shipbuilding, the US Navy will be relegated to second place." (United Press, 18th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: When a spokesman for the Navy Department received reporters today, someone asked about the news published in the US newspapers that the Japanese Navy was building sixteen super battleships. The spokesman replied that although he could not say anything about Japan's shipbuilding program, his impression was that this was deliberately propagated by the US Navy faction on the eve of the Senate's discussion of the naval budget bill in order to obtain as much funds as possible for the construction of a huge US fleet. The spokesman also said that it was regrettable that the United States had made such a fuss about Japan's shipbuilding program, because if the country correctly understood Japan's naval policy based on non-aggression, it would not have such untrue rumors.

<p>Tokyo: Suma, Director of the Information Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, recently gave a speech to the masses at the Osaka City Central Lecture Hall. He said that Japan is not concerned about other foreign events other than the "China Incident." Therefore, it can be said that Japan's policy is purely aimed at resolving the "China Incident." In other words, the policy towards China is also Japan's world policy. As for the establishment of the "Wang Jingwei regime," it does not mean the end of the "China Incident." Japan must maintain a patient attitude towards China for several years to come, and the true resolution of the "China Incident" must also wait for several years. (Havas, 17th)</p>

<h3 id="e27">Britain and France Plan to Strictly Prevent Contraband from Being Transported to Germany via the Pacific; Trade at Vladivostok Increases Greatly <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>London: According to London official sources, the Allied Powers will adopt strict plans to prevent contraband from being transported to Soviet ports via the Pacific and then to Germany. According to all the latest figures, since the start of the war, trade at the port of Vladivostok has increased greatly, unusually. The increase is not only higher than the total imports of all Soviet ports before the war but also exceeds the Soviet Union's own needs. It can be seen that Germany is now systematically transporting foreign supplies through this route. In 1938, the United States did not ship rubber, tin, or copper to the Soviet Union, and only 50 tons of copper were traded. But in the period from September 1939 to March 1940, the United States shipped 67,000 tons of copper, 6,000 tons of rubber, 2,200 tons of tin, 1,600 tons of aluminum, and 6 million pounds to the Soviet Union. Since February of this year, the United States has tried to prevent rubber and tin from being shipped to the Soviet Union. In addition to rubber and tin shipped from the United States, most of the rubber and tin from the Dutch East Indies first went to Mexico and then transshipped to Vladivostok. Recently, a batch of tin from the Dutch East Indies was loaded onto a ship and transported to the Staten Island Free Port in New York, and then shipped to Vladivostok. The ships transporting these goods are from the United States, Japan, Italy, Norway, and the Soviet Union. Germany also plans to transport smaller items with higher value, such as surveying instruments and paints, from Vladivostok to various places. (Reuters, 18th)</p>

<p>Rome: Gayda, the mouthpiece of Italian Premier Mussolini, published an article in the Italian Daily today, attacking Britain's plan to dominate the Mediterranean, saying that Britain has always pursued a policy in the Mediterranean aimed at maintaining its power and superiority in an extremely strong form, solely for the benefit of its empire. Since the conclusion of the Treaty of Versailles, Britain and France have vigorously prevented Italy's expansion in the Mediterranean. However, no matter what Britain demands from the Mediterranean, Britain is not a Mediterranean country after all. Its only legitimate demand is nothing more than a direct route to its territory. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Rome: Today's Italian official statement denies that Bali Port has been declared part of the war zone and denies the news that the Italian government has increased the conscription of fourth-class reserve soldiers. However, it stated that several thousand soldiers have been conscripted recently. (Haitong News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>London: Diplomatic circles here are paying close attention to the development of the situation in Italy. The country's decision to designate Bali Port on the Adriatic coast as a military zone and prohibit tourists from going there is particularly valued. In addition, as reported by Germany, Italy conscripted fourth-class reserve soldiers into the army this morning. As reported by the Yugoslavian radio station last night, part of the Turkish fleet sailed to the Aegean Sea. All these things are disturbing. As for Britain's attitude towards Italy, it has been explained by Cross, Minister of Economic Warfare. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Rome: The port of Bali in the Adriatic Sea has been declared a restricted area. The port is located 69 miles northwest of Brindisi. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington: According to reliable information from diplomatic circles here, German troops have been ordered to move along the southern border, and the so-called "sleeper cells" of the "Fifth Column" have deeply infiltrated the southern border. Many well-informed State Department experts believe that if the plan for joint Italian-German action is realized, the Italian army will inevitably pass through the southern country to Turkey's gateway, so as to contain Turkey and eliminate the threat of the Allied forces in Syria. (International News Service, 18th)</p>
<p>London: People in diplomatic and parliamentary circles in this question whether Italy is willing to maintain its neutrality. It is said that people originally believed that the country should stay out of the current war, but now they no longer think so. If Germany really wants Italy to join forces with it to fight against Britain and France, it is questionable whether Italy can maintain its neutrality for a long time. Although political figures say that Italy may not take action immediately, since the German invasion of Northern Europe, Italian newspapers have unanimously advocated for Germany. From this point of view, the country may eventually be dragged into the vortex one day. For example, if Germany advances into Hungary, Italy, as a member of the Rome-Berlin Axis, has the de facto necessity to send troops to maintain the balance of power between the two sides. If so, its military action will inevitably target Yugoslavia. Since the security of Greece has been formally guaranteed by Britain and France, Italy has to target the southern country. As far as Britain and France are concerned, although they have not accepted guarantees for the southern country, if Italy invades that country, it is no different from turning against Britain and France. Although it is hoped that this will not happen, Italian Premier Mussolini will inevitably lose his freedom of action one day. Therefore, Britain and France and other countries along the Mediterranean coast have already taken various precautionary measures to cope with this possible development. (Havas, 17th)</p>

<p>London: Minister of Economic Warfare Cross said in a speech in Sheffield last night that Italy would probably want other countries to treat it as a neutral country. If so, Britain should demand that it do so properly. However, the editorials of the country's newspapers have recently been quite hostile to Britain. Therefore, we must examine what the country's true attitude towards our country is. We have no grievances against the country and we sincerely hope to maintain friendly relations with it. But what exactly the relationship between the two countries is, is also something we want to frankly reveal. As far as the general situation of the European war is concerned, Germany may attack Sweden next month. Because on the Western Front, Hitler is blocked by France's "steel wall" and dare not pounce. After that, he will probably only annex small neutral countries and seize resources to attack British shipping. But British troops have landed in Narvik, Norway. It is impossible for Germany to obtain iron ore from Sweden. We express our deep sympathy for the situation of Sweden. Therefore, when it is attacked by other countries, we are prepared to provide assistance. But the country is also well aware of the crisis and is preparing to avoid being caught off guard and taken advantage of by other countries. As far as economic warfare is concerned, it is of course impossible to win a complete victory anytime and anywhere, but we must gradually tighten the blockade to exhaust Germany and then stop. Although economic warfare is not enough to determine the final victory or defeat, that is, the final victory or defeat must be determined by repeated fierce attacks by the army, economic warfare can indeed help the army to win easily, because it can shorten the war period and reduce the sacrifice of hundreds of thousands of our troops, which is also the truth.

The British Navy shelled the streets and harbor of Narvik on the evening of the 16th, but did not land troops. The British landing site is near Hasstad on Hinnoey Island, about 60 kilometers from Narvik. The German troops in Narvik advanced along the railway towards the Swedish border, defeating the Norwegian army and capturing six officers and 145 soldiers. More than 200 Norwegian soldiers fled to Sweden. This railway for transporting iron ore is now entirely in German hands. (Haitong dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin, according to responsible sources here, all four railways from Norway to Sweden are now in German hands. Norway is mountainous and transportation is inconvenient, so the occupation of the railways is of great significance. The Norwegian army put up a strong resistance when the German troops occupied the railways. The railway transporting iron ore from Narvik to the Swedish border was occupied after a fierce battle. The railway from Trondheim via Meraker to the Swedish border was also completely occupied after the German troops occupied Grosa Mao. The railway from Oslo to Sweden has been taken over by German troops after the occupation of Kongsvinger. The railway between Oslo, Frederickstad, Halden, and Cronsey was also occupied by German troops after fierce fighting. (Haitong dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>London, a Reuters military correspondent said that the important factor in military operations in Norway is speed. German troops are now consolidating their positions in the Oslo area in order to shift their attention to the Allied counter-offensive. The German troops' occupation of Kongsvinger yesterday is of great value to the German side, because Oslo is now isolated from the north, and its rear is the Swedish border, so German troops can now avoid being attacked from both sides. At present, general attention will be shifted to western Norway, as Allied forces have landed on the coast. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, according to news received here this afternoon, the town of Namsos, about 160 kilometers north of Trondheim, Norway, was occupied by German troops today. Namsos is located in northern Norway and has a railway from Trondheim to the Swedish border. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Oslo, according to information obtained here, King Haakon of Norway is currently in Sattel, 15 kilometers north of Elverum. The people in the German-occupied areas all hope that the king will return to the capital today. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Paris, according to a telegram from Stockholm, British forces have now completely controlled the city of Narvik and inflicted a major blow on the retreating German troops. These German troops would rather flee to the Swedish side to be detained than be captured by the British.</p>
<p>Berlin, the German High Command issued a war report today, stating that the British forces in Narvik are weak. Yesterday, the first attempt to land at Hanje Bay near Elvergeadesmond was repulsed by our troops. British aircraft bombed Trondheim yesterday, but failed to achieve their goal due to the effective defense of the German Air Force. There was quietness in the Jurgen area yesterday. Stavanger was bombed by British warships yesterday morning, and four German aircraft were damaged by shrapnel. Our troops immediately dispatched aircraft to bomb the British warships, dropping heavy bombs and sinking the ship. At the same time, two British aircraft were shot down by our troops in the Stavanger area. In the Oslo area, our troops advanced north as planned and reached the vicinity of Kongsvinger. Yesterday, our aircraft bombed two Norwegian torpedo boats northeast of Arendal, one of which was hit and damaged, and the crew fled ashore. On the western front, enemy forces attacked southwest of Saarbrücken, and our troops inflicted heavy casualties and repulsed them. (Haitong dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin, according to the German News Agency, there is absolutely no basis for the claim that British troops have entered Narvik. The situation in Narvik has not changed. The German military headquarters also announced that the German naval commander stationed in Narvik, Pender, was killed when British forces attacked the port. The German News Agency continued to report that the German destroyer fleet in Narvik fiercely attacked a large-scale British naval force, causing heavy losses to the British Navy. The British forces suffered the loss of several warships before sending a large fleet to continue the attack, and the German commander Pender was heroically sacrificed in this battle. (United Press dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>London, a Reuters military correspondent claimed that after the German invasion of Denmark and Norway, the entire western front has been filled with active atmosphere. Military operations on the western front are a test of the commanders' brains and creativity, and the staff's imagination and actions. The routine operations of fortress warfare have been replaced by alert temporary actions. The Allies have more experience with this kind of tactics than the German army. Regarding Norway, Stavanger is still the enemy's "eyes" so far, and the primary goal of the British attack is to destroy the area at sea with firepower, which is not easy. Low-freeboard warships equipped with high-angle guns may be used. When the German army cannot use Daverger, the first phase of the Allied plan in Norway will be completed.

<p>Bucharest, Mihalache, the former chairman of the opposition National Peasant Party, had an audience with King Carol II today, and was immediately appointed as a member of the Privy Council by the King. Therefore, he must join the National Renaissance Front and completely abandon his past prejudices. Observers said that since the government dissolved all political parties and organized the only political party, the "National Renaissance Front," Mihalache has consistently refused to cooperate. Although he is a senator, he would rather give up his political career than follow the tide because, according to the new regulations, all senators must wear the uniform of the "National Renaissance Front" in order to attend Parliament. However, his ability to change his original intention and accept the King's appointment this time is of a very important nature.

<p>In the Public Exhibition Cup Handball, after China Youth lost the singles again the night before last, West Youth had an absolute advantage of six to zero. Yesterday night's four singles were extremely important to the outcome. It was necessary to win three groups or more in order to achieve the final victory in the doubles. If two groups failed, then the second round would be hopeless. After the first three groups, Zhang Xianlun and Sun Baoqi won victories. Wang Binglin's group against M Qu Ke Ling unfortunately lost, resulting in Sun Jialu's group against F Qu Ke Ling in the end being extremely important, with the championship hanging by a thread. F Qu Ke Ling is also the champion of West Youth in this tournament, and his strength is very strong. Sun lost the first game, but finally relied on his perseverance to win two consecutive games and reverse the situation. Now the ten singles have ended, and China Youth is lagging behind with three to seven. Who will win the championship depends on the five doubles to be held next week. However, doubles are China Youth's forte, so the hope of retaining the championship is still strong.</p>

<p>In the West Youth Volleyball League, the White Team of Group A will play against St. George again tonight. The White Team has already been defeated in the previous game. It is not known whether they can avenge their defeat this time. There are also two women's games, both of which are contests between the West Youth ladies' army. In the three games of Group A the night before last, Yinghua A lost to West Youth again by one to four, but Yinghua A performed very well. Now West Youth has won six games in six wins, and winning the championship is almost certain. Both the women's Chinese teams Youxing and Minli won victories without much effort. Yesterday, the league bureau issued a notice that a part of the 27 teams in Group B withdrew for some reason, and all subsequent matches were cancelled. In the game between Le Ren and Russia on the eighth of this month, the Russian team was deemed to have forfeited because they used an unregistered player. According to the rules of the competition, players must register with the association 24 hours before the game, and the registration of new players was closed on the ninth of last month.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Jingwu Cup Table Tennis Tournament; Lu Hanjun Won Over Xiao Zhou; Won the Championship of the Sixth Group; Eighth Group Game Tonight <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The Jingwu Cup Third All-Shanghai Individual Table Tennis Championship was held at 7 pm last night in the new gym on the building of the association. The table tennis players in the group were the seventh champion Lu Hanjun. In the preliminary and semi-finals, Lu relied on his fierce Earth ball to defeat Hua Tongjian Qian Guanqin and Long Shouren, nicknamed the Foreign Trumpet, both with a score of three straight wins. Zhu Jianfei was exhausted. Finally, he met the young player Zhou Kegang and decided to win the championship. Zhou's skills were inferior to Qian and the other two. The crowd thought that Lu's victory was as easy as turning his hand. Who knew that at the beginning of the competition, Zhou Xiao Jiang had great potential. He led the way and won the first game. In the second game, Zhou's cut ball still occupied the harassing situation. When the battle reached seven to four, Lu was greatly discolored, and then changed his strategy, relying on his calm attitude, the score also changed from behind to catch up, and finally tied a game with eleven to eight. Lu did not dare to take it lightly when the third game started, and Zhou was also cautious. The race was quite tense. Lu finally won with eleven to seven and won two to one later. In the fourth game, Zhou had no intention of fighting, and Lu sailed smoothly and ended with eleven to six. In conclusion, Lu defeated Zhou Kegang with three to one and won the group championship. The upset did not come out, which can be said to be dangerous. At 7 pm tonight, the eighth group knockout will be held, still in the original place, with tickets priced at one cent to show the limit. The list is as follows:</p>
<p>Zhang Ying, Zhou Weixin, Liu Jiaren, Chen Xue</p>

<p>China Vocational Individual Table Tennis Tournament</p>
<p>The second "China Vocational Cup Individual Table Tennis Famous Tournament" hosted by the China Vocational School on Beijing Road, with more than 40 participants, has reached the final stage after more than enough competition. The strong players Mao Yong, Feng Chanchu, and Shao Lizhang all have unbeaten records and occupy a high advantage. In addition, Gan Shuming, the newly won runner-up of the Neon Cup, unfortunately followed closely behind with a difference of one point. If there is no change in the situation after this, the champion's seat will be contested by the above four. The cup bureau is to encourage the players, and the top three winners and those who abandon the right from beginning to end will have excellent prizes. Zhu Zhiying, the director of physical education at Peicheng Girls' Middle School at No. 34 Xiaoshadu Road in this city, in order to promote the importance of table tennis in various girls' schools, first created a "Table Tennis Research Class" last month, with 80 female students participating, and divided them into groups for training. The students practice with great enthusiasm. In order to promote the students' skills, Ms. Zhu specially selected the 14 most outstanding students from more than 80 students to form the Peicheng Women's Table Tennis Team. The team held an inaugural meeting at the school yesterday afternoon, and Zhu Zhiyang was elected as the leader, Zhang Lizhi and Gui Rongzheng as the captains and vice captains, Huang Renmei and Guo Huichao as the staff, and Feng Mingyin, Feng Mingyu, Feng Huizhu, Wang Luoqian, Zhang Huimei, Fang Zhiqing, Chen Emei, Zhang Xia, Yuan Xiurong, Fang Zhihui, etc. as team members.

<h3 id="e66">The Municipal Council Directors Took Office Yesterday; All Parties Expect New Facilities; Ke Ziwei and Kanae Elected as Chairman and Vice Chairman; It is Expected That the Improvement of People's Livelihood Will Have Good Plans <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The new directors of the current Municipal Council held an inauguration ceremony in the Municipal Council Building yesterday morning. The Chinese directors Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Jiang Yiping, Guo Shun, and Xi Yushu, the British directors Ke Ziwei, Hailai, Rotrik McDonald, Mi Qier, and Bao Huier, the American director Aleman Kanae, and only one Japanese director, Hagiwara Yutaro, attended. Tian Cheng was in Tokyo and did not attend. After the new directors held the inauguration ceremony, they immediately elected the chairman and vice chairman of the current Municipal Council. As a result, Ke Ziwei was elected as the chairman, and Mr. Kanae was elected as the vice chairman. Finally, a photo was taken and the meeting was dismissed.</p>
<p>Brief Biographies of the New Chairman and Vice Chairman</p>
<p>(1) Mr. Ke Ziwei is the manager of Jardine Matheson, a member of the British Chamber of Commerce, and has been in Shanghai for 14 years. He has served as a director of the Municipal Council since 1936 until now. When Mr. Fan Keling, the chairman of the Municipal Council, took leave last year, his duties were performed by Mr. Ke. His grandfather and father both served in the Municipal Council for many years. Mr. Ke's election as chairman this time is the first Englishman to be chairman of the Municipal Council in many years since Arnold. (2) Mr. Kanae is the deputy manager of the Shanghai office of Mobil Oil Company. He has been doing business in Shanghai for more than 20 years. He served as a director of the Municipal Council for three years, and only resigned due to illness in winter. Now, Mr. Kanae has been elected as the vice chairman because he has a longer history and outstanding achievements in serving in the Municipal Council than others.</p>
<p>It is Widely Rumored That the Japanese Director Tian Cheng Resigned</p>
<p>As for the Japanese director Tian Cheng, chairman of the "China Railway Company," it was learned yesterday that he had the intention of submitting his resignation before taking office. Yesterday, the Japanese Continental News claimed that Tian Cheng had the opinion of resigning, but the reason for the resignation could not be learned. The newspaper repeated that Tian Cheng's resignation had a great impact on the Japanese community, which was enough to shake people's hearts. However, this matter can only be decided after Tian Cheng returns to Shanghai from Tokyo. According to the Japanese, if Tian Cheng resigns, his successor will be Okamoto Kazusaku, because Tian Cheng received 5,025 votes in this election, and Okamoto Kazusaku received 5,023 votes, only two votes apart, and Okamoto also has considerable prestige among the Japanese in Shanghai. According to another aspect, the motive for Tian Cheng's resignation this time is that the Japanese were miserably defeated in this election, and Okamoto Kazusaku was originally a director of the Municipal Council, but he was defeated this time, and Tian Cheng is a "new Japanese" who came to Shanghai after the outbreak of the war. He knows the situation in Shanghai as well as Okamoto Kazusaku, so Tian Cheng's resignation clearly has the intention of giving way to the worthy.</p>
<p>All Parties Expect the New Directors Eagerly</p>
<p>The post-war concession administration is special and difficult due to the environment, and it is very different from the past. Under this extraordinary situation, all parties have higher expectations for the new directors. All parties hope that the directors should do their best to maintain the rights and interests of the Municipal Council, no matter what difficulties they encounter, and that the soaring prices affect people's livelihood, and should be improved as soon as possible. The whole city hopes that the suppression of profiteers and the prevention of hoarding and speculation should be implemented vigorously.</p>
<p>Changes in the Municipal Council Office</p>
<p>The Municipal Council's General Office, which was located in the east of the Municipal Council Building, has now been moved to the north, namely the former office of the president Fei Xindun. The British Deputy Director General Ge Bo and the current President and Director General Fei Lipu are working together, and the offices of the Chinese Deputy Director General He Dekui, the Japanese Deputy Director General Yabashuku, and the Secretary General Nashu are still located in the east. The Chairman's office has been changed to the former Ge Bo office.</p>
<p>Mr. Fulan Shan Is About to Retire</p>
<p>The British director of the Municipal Council's Information Office, Fulan Shan, has served in the bureau for more than ten years. He succeeded Mr. Saiya as the director of the Information Office for seven years. It is now heard that Mr. Fu will retire on the first of next month, and the new director will be succeeded by the British Oknal. Mr. Yu is now working in the Information Office.</p>
<p>Concession Administration Must Be Improved</p>
<p>The Miller Review, which will be published tomorrow, will have an editorial saying that the Japanese have been completely defeated in this Municipal Council director election, and the situation in Shanghai is becoming more tense as a result. The author firmly believes that although Shanghai residents agree that the concession administration needs to be improved, they are determined not to do it through the hands of the Japanese, as if to achieve this goal. It also said that in any city occupied by the Japanese, the corruption of the Japanese political succession has been an undeniable fact. Shanghai residents only need to go to the "bad land" in the Shanghai West Beyond Road area (that is, the area under the jurisdiction of the Japanese and the puppet authorities) for an inspection to believe what he said is true.</p>
<p>Changes in the Municipal Council Office</p>
<p>Ke Dejun, the information expert of the German Embassy in China, routinely entertained news reporters at the International Hotel at 5 pm yesterday. Fei Zongzhi, secretary of the embassy, ​​Jiao Huafu, Jiang Zhaofeng, and more than 30 reporters from various newspapers attended. During the meeting, Ke Dejun talked about his satisfaction and gratitude for the election of German overseas Chinese to serve as members of the Economic Committee Inspection Committee at this year's Western taxpayer conference, and considered it the first step in implementing "internationalization."</p>
<h3 id="e67">The "Special Police" Issue; Consultation Today; There Is a Saying That It Will Be Resolved Within a Week <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>According to reliable sources, the chief inspector of the Police Department of the Municipal Council, Mr. Bowen, told reporters yesterday that the "Special Police Team for Beyond the Road in West Shanghai" may be announced within the next three weeks. It is said that the Municipal Council is represented by Bowen and Smith, and the puppet government is represented by Lu Ying and his Japanese advisor, Colonel Lan Cui, and it is stipulated that meetings will be held twice a week to discuss all the ways to solve difficult problems. He also said that this afternoon, the two sides will hold a meeting in the area north of the Suzhou River to continue the points discussed last weekend and exchange opinions. The organization of the special police for the construction of roads beyond the boundaries of West Shanghai is based on the police agreement signed between the Municipal Council and the puppet government in February this year. At that time, the Municipal Council, in view of the police affairs of the so-called bad land, often caused conflicts and disputes under the dual jurisdiction of the bureau and the puppet government, and the puppet government alone could not maintain the order of the construction of roads beyond the boundaries, so there was a double cooperative nature of the organization "Special Police" to solve various difficulties.</p>
<h3 id="e68">The Qingpu Road Battle is Expanding - The Situation in Western Shanghai is Tense - Japanese Troops Continue to Kill and Injure Civilians - Puppet Troops on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway are Disarmed and Detained <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, dense machine gun fire and continuous artillery fire have been heard every night in the western suburbs of Shanghai, continuing throughout the night. According to people from Beixinjing, the clear sounds of gunfire are from Chinese guerilla forces engaging the Japanese forces in areas such as Panlong, Huangdu, Jiwangmiao, Qibao, Sijing, and elsewhere. These engagements are more intense than in previous days, and the sounds are especially clear late at night.</p>
<p>Injured Women and Children Come to Shanghai at Night</p>
<p>According to the English-language North China Daily News, guerilla warfare is fierce along the Qingpu Road in western Shanghai. A woman and a four-year-old boy have been injured by stray bullets and sent to the Tongren Hospital on Avenue Dubail for treatment. The two were aboard a sampan on the night of the 14th or 15th, moored at Xiaobang when fighting suddenly broke out all around them, with bullets flying everywhere. The woman's left arm was fractured by a bullet, and the boy was hit in the right thigh. Relatives drove the sampan slowly to Shanghai, and after docking at Lincoln Road this morning, they called the Fire Brigade ambulance at 10:30 AM to take them to the hospital.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Have Been Killing for Five Days</p>
<p>Reports from various sources indicate that the fighting on the Qingpu Road involves the puppet troops under Xu, in conjunction with Japanese forces stationed in Huangdu, Qibao, Beixinjing, Jiwangmiao, and Xujing, as well as a large detachment of Japanese cavalry drawn from Jiangwan. They are encircling and attacking the area where Gu's troops are stationed. Gu's troops are responding calmly with mobile tactics, killing a considerable number of Japanese and puppet soldiers. The Japanese and puppet soldiers, unwilling to accept defeat, are venting their anger on the local farmers, resulting in hundreds of deaths daily. This search and kill operation has been going on for five days. Now, the New Fourth Army from the Nanjing-Shanghai line has arrived in the area and is launching attacks alongside Gu's troops, throwing the local Japanese and puppet forces into panic, especially Xu's troops.</p>
<p>Puppet Troops in Suzhou Forced to Disarm</p>
<p>According to people from Suzhou, recently two or three hundred puppet troops were sent to the Suzhou area, but the Japanese suddenly surrounded them with artillery fire and forced them to disarm. As a result, over thirty puppet soldiers were killed or wounded, and two or three hundred rifles were confiscated. All puppet officers, large and small, were detained.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Strike at the Shanghai Gas Company Still Unresolved Yesterday - Employer's Reply Unsatisfactory to Employees - Slowdown Spreads After Resumption of Work <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>All Chinese employees of the British-owned Shanghai Gas Company, after failing to get the company to improve their compensation, began a slowdown the day before yesterday. The workers have made seven demands, and the staff has made five demands, which were sent to the company's manager, Brown, and chief engineer, Thomson. Brown and others accepted them and forwarded them to the board of directors. All employees are awaiting the company's response. According to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, after this incident occurred, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Industrial Section, considering it a matter of public concern, intervened and urged all employees not to take extreme measures and to resume work first. The employees followed the advice and resumed work at 2:00 PM yesterday. The company also convened a board meeting at the same time to seek a resolution.</p>
<p>Reply to Workers</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the company's board of directors met to discuss the various demands made by the employees. Afterwards, the company's representatives responded to the workers' seven demands as follows: (1) Increase wages by 30%; (2) If the price of rice is above 20 yuan, the company should provide rice subsidies at the highest price; if it is below 20 yuan, the company can cancel the rice subsidies; (3) The company should increase wages by 10% annually; (4) Wages should be paid during holidays; (5) Workers should not be dismissed arbitrarily without special fault; (6) If the employer wants to dismiss a worker, they should give six months' severance pay, and savings should also be calculated; (7) Year-end bonuses should be paid at one month's salary. The company's response to the above demands was as follows: (1) The company would only increase wages by 7.5%; (2) The company did not accept, and the workers offered a concession, requesting that rice subsidies of 17.5 yuan be provided if the price of rice is above 20 yuan, but the company still did not accept this; (3) and (4) The company did not accept either of these demands; (5) The company accepted; (6) The company did not accept; (7) The company would give workers a year-end bonus of half a month's salary for service of one to ten years, and one month's salary for service of over ten years.</p>
<p>Reply to Staff</p>
<p>The company authorities also responded to the five demands made by the Chinese staff, namely: (1) Increase subsidies to 50%; (2) If the price of rice exceeds 20 yuan, the company must subsidize one-half; (3) Request annual salary increases; (4) Three weeks of annual leave should be granted; (5) For savings, the company should give an additional 10% of salary each month, with compound interest calculated at 6% every six months. The company's response to the above demands was as follows: (1) The company would only increase it to 30%; (2) If the price of rice exceeds 20 yuan, the company would only give a maximum rice subsidy of 7 yuan; (3) Annual salary increases would be one-third of the monthly salary; (4) Staff with salaries above 100 yuan and service of over ten years can get two weeks of annual leave; (5) Savings would be calculated at half a month's salary for each year of service and the last salary amount prior to retirement.</p>
<p>Another Slowdown</p>
<p>The employees expressed dissatisfaction with the board's reply and resumed the slowdown, because the board of directors only offered a 7.5% increase for the workers' first demand of a 30% wage increase, and the company could only offer a 30% increase for the staff's demand for a 50% increase. Therefore, the employees convened a meeting to discuss how to respond, and as a result, they first sent a letter to the company authorities, stating their difficulties and that it was difficult to maintain a living in the face of rising prices. It is heard that the slowdown has now spread to the Yangshupu gas plant and the coal gas plant, where all the employees have responded to the head office and joined the slowdown yesterday afternoon, submitting the same demands as the head office employees to the company.</p>
<p>Difficult Living</p>
<p>According to an employee of the company, Mr. So-and-so, speaking to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, the company's launch of the slowdown was a last resort, because the company has been established for more than 70 years, and the Chinese employees have always been extremely loyal in their service. This unfortunate incident occurred because of the recent high prices of goods in Shanghai, and monthly salaries are simply not enough to maintain a living. The company has annual profits, so they were forced to make legitimate demands to the company authorities.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Shanghai Municipal Council Considers Compensation for Chinese Employees <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Chief Inspector Bowen of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department told reporters yesterday that the issue of increasing salaries for Chinese employees of the SMC was raised for discussion at the annual meeting of Western ratepayers. Before the 1940 budget was passed that day, Mr. Reykin, an American, gave a speech on the salaries of Chinese constables. He believed that the salaries and subsidies they currently receive are simply not enough to have any surplus each month, especially for those with large families. He said that the average salary of each constable is currently 32 yuan per month, with other subsidies amounting to only 6 yuan. Bowen said that the special nature of this matter should be given serious consideration, but the SMC's expenditure details must also be taken into account. Another police officer said that the compensation of Chinese constables is actually lower than that of police in other parts of China. He said that in addition to subsidies, the salary of each constable ranges from 21 to 50 yuan per month.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Norwegian Ships on the Far East Route Ordered to Concentrate in Hong Kong - Three Norwegian Ships in Shanghai Sail Empty to Hong Kong - Shipping Issues to be Decided Soon <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Recently, with the expansion of the European war, Denmark has been occupied by Germany, and part of Norway has also been attacked. Overseas trade in these two countries has become problematic, and shipping companies are the first to be affected. It is said that Danish ships in Hong Kong have been detained, and Danish ships in Shanghai have also stopped sailing. As for Norwegian merchant ships, it was previously reported that sailing south of Hong Kong had been suspended, but the Shanghai-Hong Kong route was still operating as usual. Yesterday, it was learned that Norwegian ships have also been ordered to concentrate in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Norwegian Ships in Shanghai</p>
<p>There are only three ships currently. The Hua Lun Shipping Company's "Savigen" sailed empty to Hong Kong yesterday morning to await orders. The "Lairagsagen" will also sail to Hong Kong within days. The "Wilford," managed by Jebsen &amp; Co., originally scheduled to load a large quantity of corn in Shanghai and transport it to Longkou on the 12th, has cancelled the export due to the above-mentioned impact. It is now known that the goods that have already been loaded on the ship will be unloaded and stored in the Longmao Warehouse in Pudong. The ship will then sail to Hong Kong after the goods are unloaded. As for the Norwegian shipping issue, the manager of Hua Lun Shipping Company has been discussing it with the consulate every day recently, but there has been no result. Whether to suspend or continue sailing should be decided within the next two days. It is heard that several ships in Saigon carrying rice to Shanghai have also stopped loading.</p>
<p>Sailing Empty to Hong Kong - Due to the limitations of the environment and the many inconveniences in sailing, the merchant ships managed by Norwegian merchants in the Far East have been contacting the shipowners to return the management rights, and they are seeking to be managed by merchants of other nationalities. It is heard that some Norwegian ships will be leased to British and American shipping companies, and negotiations are underway. Shanghai is a gathering place for ships from various countries. Since the European war, British and French merchant ships have changed course first, followed by the suspension of some German ships. Now, the shipping of Denmark and Norway is also affected by the war. This is an unprecedented change in shipping. According to general observation, the European situation has recently taken a sharp turn, and the situation is becoming increasingly tense. If the war continues to deteriorate, German and Italian merchant ships in the Far East will also be affected, which is a concern for the entire shipping industry.</p>

The fundraising agencies remain the Shanghai Jin Cheng, Fu Yuan, Tong Run and other trade associations, and it is scheduled to hold a committee meeting next week to expand fundraising efforts and discuss the date and methods of charity rice sales.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Two US Warships to Sail to Shanghai from the Philippines - Expected to Arrive This Month - Cruisers May Also Arrive <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily News, sources say that the US warship Black Hawk and a destroyer squadron from the US Asiatic Fleet will sail from Manila to Shanghai this month, and will sail to Qingdao in June to spend the summer. There is no news yet about the movements of the cruisers Augusta and Marblehead, but it is heard that the two ships will also arrive here soon. Six old-style US submarines and the US warship Canopus, which arrived in Shanghai from the Philippines last week, are expected to sail to Qingdao next week and return to Manila in November. It is heard that the new-style submarines in the Asiatic Fleet will remain in Manila. The US transport ship Henderson, carrying US troops to Shanghai for rotation, is scheduled to sail from the US Pacific coast via Guam and the Philippines to Shanghai on May 1st.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Refugee Camps to Close Next Month - Only One Remaining on Dunxin Road - Sheltering the Old, Young, and Disabled <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Salvation Army leader Mr. Maurice told reporters yesterday that all of the more than 30 refugee camps in Shanghai will be closed by the end of May, and the refugee problem in Shanghai will become a thing of the past. However, the refugee camp on Dunxin Road will be retained to shelter the elderly, orphaned children, or the disabled. Regarding the refugee relief funding, Mr. Maurice said that the highest recorded amount in 1937 was 725,000 yuan per month, but it has gradually decreased to 70,000 yuan per month. However, refugee donations from entertainment venues have not yet been cancelled. Mr. Maurice also said that although efforts are being made to enable refugees to seek a living on their own, these methods have been difficult to implement. The so-called beggar camps have been re-established due to environmental needs, and the refugee problem has not been solved. However, he believes that the number of beggars in Shanghai will be reduced to around one thousand in the near future. He also said that each discharged refugee will be given a subsidy of 15 yuan for adults and 5 yuan for minors. In this way, each larger family can receive around 60 yuan, which most can use as capital to return to their hometowns and engage in farming or seek other livelihoods. The Salvation Army also provides considerable travel expenses to refugees who are discharged and return to their hometowns, so that they can return to their homelands and have their duties taken over by others, in order to solve the refugee problem in Shanghai. Mr. Maurice also pointed out that all matters are being carried out in appropriate steps to ensure that they are effective and economical. However, the Salvation Army will never adopt a group resettlement method, because everyone's situation is different, and the resettlement method for each person must be given considerable consideration. Currently, they believe that 75% of the refugees can find their own way out, and others will be given appropriate training for a period of time. Refugee resettlement has already begun, and about half of the refugee camps will be closed by the end of this month. As for the others, they must be closed by the end of May. Orphans in the refugee camp on Dunxin Road will be given appropriate education, training, and vocational training so that these children can be self-sufficient when they grow up. Others who are old, weak, and disabled will be given appropriate medical care to maintain their health. It is estimated that these expenses will cost about 7 yuan per month per person. The expenses incurred in the beggar camps will be equal to this amount. However, the beggars in the beggar camps cannot have absolute freedom and must be subject to strict training, because most of them are inherently lazy, and strict training is necessary to correct their bad habits. Finally, Mr. Maurice recounted the history of the refugee camps and expressed his deep gratitude for the enthusiasm of the people of Shanghai in helping the refugees, because since the establishment of the camps, there has never been a problem with funding. In short, the refugee problem in Shanghai has a glorious history, and the refugees have benefited greatly. Not only have they obtained appropriate jobs, but most of those who were ill have also been cured. Mr. Maurice expressed his gratitude to Mr. Yu Qiaqing and Mr. Yuan Ludeng, because they were extremely hardworking in preparing the refugee donations. However, the high cost of living also has a great impact on refugee relief. In the past, the relief fee for each refugee was only 2.73 yuan per month, but now it is impossible to do without 7 yuan per month.</p>

<p>The British United Shipyards, including the Ruirong, Hesheng, Yiesong, and Si factories, are owned by British merchants. The workers at the British United factories have been brewing disputes because the employers have not fulfilled the labor-management agreement signed on December 6, 1937. On March 15th, the Ruirong, Hesheng, and Yiesong factories went on strike, presenting British Manager Bonner with eleven demands for improving living conditions, raising wages, and fulfilling the labor-management agreement. Eleven representatives elected by the British United Shipyard Workers' Union negotiated with the employers, and the Political Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council intervened to mediate. A month has passed, and the workers are in dire straits, suffering greatly. During this time, they have received sympathy and assistance from all sectors of society in Shanghai, and they are very grateful for the donations. On the 16th, workers at the Hefeng Shipyard in Pudong (across the river from Yangshupu) also responded with a slowdown, but the order is very good. It is heard that Mr. Yuan Ludeng will now mediate between labor and management, so the strike may be resolved satisfactorily. It is heard that the Taikoo Company's Beiyang class Shengjing is also being repaired at the factory. It was originally scheduled to leave the dock today and resume sailing tomorrow (20th), but because the workers are slowing down, the ship's engine blades and anchors have not been installed, so it is uncertain whether it can leave the dock today. The Taikoo Company is doing its best to find a solution, and plans to hire Russian craftsmen to go to the factory to install and manage.</p>

<p>According to the North China Daily News, the French Consulate General has announced that five German residents in the French Concession have been ordered to leave the French Concession before the 30th of this month. When the European War broke out last September, the French Concession authorities notified German residents in the Concession that if they did not disturb public order and their actions did not violate the neutral status of the French Concession, they could continue to reside there. However, these five people did not abide by this statement, so they have been ordered to move out of their French Concession residences within the month. As for the rumor that all German residents in the French Concession will be gradually expelled, this is not accurate. Only German residents whose actions violate the conditions for residing in the French Concession will be ordered to leave.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Mechanical Coal Briquette Trade Association's third round of cheap coal briquette sales will end tomorrow, and whether to hold the fourth round of cheap coal briquette sales depends on the negotiations of the manufacturers. Therefore, the association notified all manufacturers yesterday to hold a joint meeting at the Coal Industry Building on Tianjin Road at 3:00 PM this afternoon to discuss various issues. There is currently a lot of coal in Shanghai, and 3,000 to 4,000 tons of foreign coal are shipped to Shanghai every day. 11,000 tons of Indian coal arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and are currently being unloaded at the Qichang Wharf and other wharves. Moreover, a certain coal mining company regularly ships about 100,000 tons of bituminous coal to Shanghai every month, so there is no shortage of coal in Shanghai. However, general speculators are taking advantage of the tense European war and manipulating the coal market, causing black market prices to rise by more than ten yuan, making it difficult for users to purchase.</p>

<p>In order to maintain the statutory exchange rate and stabilize the value of legal tender, the National Government will export cash gold and silver to replenish reserves. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from customs yesterday that the total statistics of gold and silver exports from August 26th to February 29th were 4,885,279 gold and 426,408,938 yuan of silver.</p>

<p>In order to maintain creditworthiness, the Ministry of Finance is making efforts to pay the principal and interest of domestic and foreign debts on schedule, even in the midst of financial difficulties. Although the Shanghai customs tax revenue has been seized, the Central Bank initially overdrafted and paid it. Although it has now been stated that separate payment methods will be determined for bonds guaranteed by customs duties, the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank are still discounting and paying for the Unified Reconstruction Gold Long-Term Three Internal Debts, which is sufficient to prove the government's determination to maintain creditworthiness. The Ministry will allocate the funds for the principal and interest due on the National Salvation Public Bond, National Defense Public Bond, Gold Public Bond, and Construction Military Supply Public Bond issued after the war to the Central Bank for special storage in accordance with the regulations of each bond. (1) The second repayment of principal and payment of interest on the National Defense Public Bond and Gold Public Bond, as well as the first repayment of principal and payment of interest on the Construction Public Bond, are scheduled to begin at the end of April. (2) The first repayment of principal and payment of interest on the Military Supply Public Bond are scheduled to begin at the end of June. (3) The third payment of interest on the National Salvation Public Bond is scheduled to begin at the end of August. (4) The ninth repayment of principal and payment of interest on the five types of Unified Public Bond A, B, C, D, and E is scheduled to begin at the end of July. Today, bondholders admire the government's painstaking efforts to maintain creditworthiness, so the buying interest in the unified bonds on the Shanghai stock market's black market is strong, and the bond market is improving. The high rise in the unified price is rare after the war.</p>

<p>The Chinese Consul General in Hanoi has sent a letter to the visa commissioner stationed in Hong Kong under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Travelers from Shanghai and Hong Kong carrying clothes to Hanoi and then to the mainland should first report the number of items. Those for profit should pay taxes, otherwise, once discovered, the fines are quite high. The announcement of the Hong Kong Visa Commissioner's Office is recorded as follows: "Now, the Consulate General in Hanoi has sent a letter stating that some merchants in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and other places are buying used Western-style clothes and mixing them into the luggage and transporting them to Vietnam and then to Sichuan, Yunnan, and other provinces for sale in order to make profits. Some carry too many clothes and the styles and sizes are different, which causes the customs to accuse them of tax evasion and the fines are quite high. These merchants are taking advantage of themselves and also implicating general travelers who do not intend to profit. It is proposed to notify merchants traveling from Shanghai and Hong Kong to Vietnam: (1) If the used clothes are actually for profit, they should apply for a consular visa in advance and declare and pay taxes in accordance with the law when importing (border tax is 1% per day or 4% per hundred). (2) Travelers carrying more Western-style clothes for personal use must also declare the number of Western-style suits in the box before customs officers inspect their luggage to avoid misunderstandings. Please check and handle accordingly, and it should be handled accordingly. It is announced for general knowledge."</p>

<h3 id="e85">Fank Ling, Chairman of the Board, Summary of Annual Meeting Speech (2) <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Food and Goods</p>
<p>The soaring prices of food and various essential goods are a serious problem. I am not an economics expert, but from an economic standpoint, dealing with such problems requires extreme caution. Overly strict control of these goods by the authorities is not a perfect solution and often leads to failure. This bureau has been cooperating with the authorities of the French Concession to suppress prices and crack down on hoarding, speculation, and profiteering, and has received automatic assistance from all sectors. We are doing our best within our power. However, until the situation is stabilized and goods from the interior can be transported to Shanghai as usual, a true solution to this problem will be difficult to achieve. As for food imported from abroad, the cost will inevitably be higher based on current exchange rates. In other words, unless rice produced in the interior can be transported to Shanghai without any restrictions or miscellaneous taxes, it will be difficult to expect a significant drop in rice prices in this port.</p>
<p>Relief Work</p>
<p>In order to comprehensively resolve the beggar problem in the concession, this bureau previously announced a plan to accommodate beggars, which I believe has attracted attention and support from all sectors. It should be noted that the beggar problem and the refugee problem are interrelated. In the past, many Chinese and foreign organizations have been generous in donating to help accommodate refugees, which is deeply appreciated. In addition, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, various provincial and regional associations, trade guilds, and charitable organizations have established shelters and raised funds to help refugees. At the same time, the Salvation Army is also closely involved in refugee relief and has generously offered to take on the work of accommodating beggars. Bureau staff are unable to allocate resources, and this work requires trained professionals to handle social problems effectively. The beggar problem faces practical and economic difficulties and cannot be resolved until the refugee problem is resolved. In view of this, the bureau has suggested that refugee shelters should merge as soon as possible and arrange for refugees to be given money and dispersed, in order to convert to accommodating beggars in early winter this year. The Salvation Army has not raised funds for accommodating beggars, but it is expected that the funds donated to aid refugees can be used for accommodating beggars.</p>
<p>Since 1937, I have been involved in the administrative guidance of the concession and, fortunately, have not made any significant mistakes. I am personally gratified. I will no longer address you as the Chairman of the Board. However, I am optimistic about the future of the concession. The concession has real value and importance not only for foreigners in general but also for China and the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Last Year's Accounts</p>
<p>The financial situation of the bureau for the year 1939 has been detailed in the report of the Chief Financial Officer, which I believe you have all read. However, I must emphasize one important point regarding the more noteworthy events of the past year. The continuous devaluation of the national currency last year had a significant impact on the bureau's various expenses, starting in June. Various exceptional expenditures calculated in foreign currency and the cost of all imported goods saw immediate increases. Most other items and materials also increased in price, resulting in a shortfall in the bureau's budget for the last year exceeding the initial estimate by about three million yuan. Although we sought remedies in terms of finance in July last year, the restrictions under the bureau's "Temporary Debt" item could be used to offset part of the deficit, but the loss was heavy and not very cost-effective. As for issuing national currency bonds, it was practically difficult to do so. Therefore, apart from borrowing foreign currency, there was no other good plan. At that time, the bureau's temporary loans from banks had reached £335,000. Due to urgent needs, another £100,000 was borrowed, totaling £435,000. The Financial Officer's report details the revised method for the 1926 6% bond fund. After the bureau sold the electricity division, it was originally planned to repay the bond at the end of 1936. However, the situation in 1935 was poor, and the repayment period was postponed. At the same time, the deposit of the bond fund was revised. As a result, the surplus fund of 2,577,502 yuan could be used as temporary income, and the interest of 581,226 yuan could be transferred to the general reserve fund. In addition, the investable amount of the fund is estimated to be around 3,158,728 yuan. As for the bureau's temporary overdraft last year, it has been reduced from 7,776,595 yuan to 2,970,523 yuan, as detailed in the Financial Officer's report, which I will not repeat here. All reports and accounts of the bureau as of December 31 last year should be approved.</p>

<p>Yin Zuhao, a native of Hangzhou, a shareholder and manager of Lichang Native Bank at 477 Sichuan Road, Ningbo Road, reported to the General Patrol Room at 9:30 p.m. on the 11th of this month that the bank had US$1,394 and Japanese Yen 1,000, totaling 23,470 yuan in Chinese currency, placed in a small iron box that suddenly</p>
<p>disappeared. He requested an investigation. Detective Feng Qishan and Detective Zhu Wanjun were assigned to investigate. Initially, Qian Xianglin, the clerk from Zhenjiang, was suspected, and he was arrested, sent to the First Special Court for interrogation, and detained for investigation. Later, detectives found that Qian had nothing to do with the case and requested the Special Court to release Qian. They learned that the real culprit was Yin Zuhao himself.</p>
<p>Yin was arrested and sent to the Fourth Criminal Division of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Chiang Bao-lien, the police lawyer, charged him with theft, stating that the defendant stole the iron box and took it to Room 321 of the Far Eastern Hotel on Yuqiaqing Road. He bought a screw cone and tried to open the iron box. He then took the money to his home at 10 Lane 14, Baierbu Road, in the French Concession, and stored it there, abandoning the screw cone and iron box in the Far East. All the stolen goods and the iron box, etc.,</p>
<p>have been recovered. Guo Shiping, the representative of Lichang Native Bank, complained about everything. Because all the lost money had been recovered, he requested that the matter not be pursued further. When questioned, the defendant Yin Zuhao remained silent and hired a lawyer to defend him. Judge Meng sentenced Yin to a fine of 500 yuan, which could be commuted to labor service at 3 yuan per day, and ordered his lawyer to bail him out.</p>

<p>Huang Shihuan, a local resident living at 11 Youyi Lane, 410 Jin Shenfu Road, French Concession, who previously worked at the Jianghai Customs, is 60 years old. Recently, he entrusted lawyer Huang Jiyuan to file a complaint with the Second Criminal Court, accusing Xu Yongkang, the owner of Yongxin Weaving Factory at 1226 Lane 1, Jiale Road (28 years old, the factory's business department and distribution office is located at 308 Fada Road), of fraudulently obtaining money by advertising the transfer of the house and requesting a legal investigation. According to the complaint, the defendant advertised the transfer of the house at 125 Lane 569, Ya'erbei Road, on March 6 this year. The plaintiff, needing a house to live in, went to see the defendant, who said that the lease of the house was not fixed and there was no lease agreement. Believing this to be true, they agreed on a price of 1,650 yuan for the transfer and paid a deposit of 280 yuan, holding a receipt. On the 11th of the same month, when he went with the money, the defendant suddenly refused to issue a transfer document, and forcibly sold furniture, deliberately pointing east and saying west. The plaintiff became suspicious. After investigation, he learned that the lease of the house was not only for a fixed term, but was about to expire, and the defendant concealed this, implementing deceptive</p>
<p>methods, clearly intending to illegally possess it for himself, and using fraud to make others hand over their property, committing the crime of fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Law. He requested a legal investigation and attached a civil lawsuit, ordering the defendant to repay the plaintiff 280 yuan in national currency. The court accepted the complaint and Judge Zhu Chuzhe held a hearing yesterday morning. Both parties and their lawyers were present. After a detailed hearing in court, the court announced that the case still needed to be investigated and adjourned for another hearing.</p>

<p>Wangfu Nail Factory at 297 Yichang Road, opened by Xu Hengde, ordered 300 tons of raw material for wire nails "new coil ingot" from Bide Long Foreign Firm at 255 Beijing Road through the introduction of Rong Jintang on May 8 last year. The firm's Chinese comprador, Tong Kuixuan, was responsible for the negotiation, and the price was set at US$42.75 per ton, with delivery scheduled for August of the same year. The contract was signed by Luke Mann, the head of the Bide Long Foreign Firm. In early September, 100 tons were delivered first. Later, due to the outbreak of war in Europe on September 4, steel prices soared. Therefore, the Bide Long Foreign Firm used the war as an excuse and has delayed delivery until now. Wangfu Nail Factory ordered the goods very early, and they had already been shipped abroad and even arrived at the port. The firm intends to breach the contract to seize huge profits. Therefore, it entrusted Tang Ying, Jiang Yiping, and Ge Bangren as lawyers to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court, seeking performance and compensation for damages. The court accepted the complaint, and Judge Mo Runhua summoned them for questioning yesterday. First, the plaintiff's agent Chen Ming stated the purpose of the lawsuit. Then, the defendant Tong Kuixuan and Rong Jintang pushed responsibility on each other, claiming that although they were managers, they were not responsible for business. Then, the plaintiff's agent presented Liu Tonggui, the former Chinese manager of Bide Long Foreign Firm, to testify, stating that according to custom, the Chinese manager of each foreign firm is indeed responsible for trade, and the signing by Westerners is only a formality. Judge Cao verified the testimony and adjourned the hearing for further investigation.</p>

<p>Yesterday's spot gold market conditions, the afternoon market was quiet, and the evening market suddenly soared, reaching as high as 5,840 yuan.

Soon, the Japanese yarn factory suddenly bought forward Sterling, and speculators also followed suit, buying US Dollar, with the momentum slightly weakening. At this time, outside firms continued to supply with undiminished intention, but buyers' appetite was indifferent, so the late closing returned to flat. As a result, Sterling closed at 4/125, and the US Dollar at 5.96875. As for the futures US Dollar, it remained unchanged, while Sterling was slightly softened.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the securities unofficial market situation turned weak and falling again. The claim of Nanchang's recapture could not be confirmed, and the tightening of monetary policy made it impossible for the bulls to find positions. The excessively high interbank lending rates added another layer of restraint. With the approaching fourth bottom ratio period, the impact on the bond market was even greater. Even without other rumors, it was not easy to be optimistic for the time being. Looking at yesterday's events, the market price was stable at the beginning of the morning opening. Jianli and Yiyuan covered short positions, but real goods from Jardine Matheson, Xie Dafu, Datongji, etc., gradually flowed out, and the price slowly fell. Although Tongcheng, Hongkang, and scattered retail investors supplemented their positions, Tongguang, Taifeng, Yitai, etc., also sold goods for profit, so the noon closing market price failed to stabilize. Selling pressure was even stronger in the afternoon. Hengkang, Yongkang, and Lianhe sold out in large numbers. Xiexing and Yuanrunli covered short positions. Yichang, Xie Da, and Lianyi bought in slightly. Hongda first advanced and then came out again. The 41st number entered C and exited A. Tiansheng, Xinchang, Yuanqi, Hu Heji, etc., still sold out. Grade E broke 50 yuan, Grade C would retreat into the 9 yuan level, and Grade D also broke 9 yuan. As a result, it consistently returned a small 4 to 5.5 jiao compared to the previous day. The total number of transactions was approximately 1.2 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock transactions: 100 shares of Great China Match Company were traded at a price of 25.5 yuan.</p>
<p>At the opening of the public stock market, those closing their floating profits were still in droves, but this trend soon stopped. Then the bulls became active again and went in groups, and the market was immersed in a buying atmosphere. Several types rose sharply beyond the usual.</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson and Steel stocks can be called the "stars of the stars" among the rising stocks. Shanghai Bank, International, Yangzi, and other stocks also followed quickly. Jardine Matheson opened at 178 yuan, and after a period of hope and spin, buyers suddenly came to compete to buy, and in an instant flew to 200 yuan, and then fluctuated within a price range of 5-6 yuan. In the afternoon, another wave of buying was triggered, and the price jumped directly to 204 yuan, but the closing was peaceful, with buyers at 201 yuan. Steel stocks broke all previous high price records yesterday, opening at 32.25 yuan. After opening and hovering, they also leaped to 37.75 yuan in an instant.

The opening price of Shanghai Bank was only 30 yuan, and after a large number of transactions, the price also went straight ahead, with the closing price being buying at 33 yuan and selling at 33.5 yuan.</p>
<p>At noon, a Washington telecommunications message was received, saying that "The US government must maintain the status quo on the Dutch East Indies issue, even if the Netherlands is thrown into the vortex of the European war." This message made the general public suddenly start buying rubber stocks that had not been invigorated, and prices made considerable progress.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Rises Again, Spot Supply Becomes Tighter <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had plummeted the previous day (the 17th), rebounded yesterday (the 18th), due to the lack of spot goods and the tightening of supply. Although there was demand in the inland areas, there were no spot goods to be had. Therefore, the weak hearts suddenly turned firm. Recently, the market has seen rapid falls and rises, which is frightening. Some say that the number of cotton yarns transported to Xianggang (Hong Kong) according to the investigation of this newspaper is estimated to be more than 20,000 bales.</p>
<p>The opening of current yarn was peaceful, and a certain major player took advantage of the situation to throw out, lowering the market, and then dragging it in again, so the market began to tire and then rise. The opening price of 20 count Double Horse factory single yarn was 1,325 yuan, and dozens of bales were sold. At this time, the merchant gangs also watched and did not move. However, the selling price of 23 count Golden Rooster yarn has been expensive to more than 1,500, and there is no spot. It was also heard that the cloth market has risen sharply, and so-and-so came to collect in again, and the market was promoted by this, and suddenly rose. The price of 20 count Double Horse factory single yarn was 1,385 yuan, and spot goods rose to 1,395 yuan. The statistics of transactions in half a day were 2,222 bales. The market price of 20 count Double Horse spot yarn rose by 58 yuan.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, there were special storms again, and the yarn market's heart was burning again. It was heard that 20 count Double Horse spot yarn was 1,420 yuan, and a few bales were traded, and there was still talk of not being able to buy it. This kind of unpredictable situation is impossible to grasp, and it is a speculation that speculators are stirring up waves. The amount bought by each gang is listed as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Active Foreign Cotton Trading <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>This cotton trade is less colorful than before. The market is flat and not as neat as the yarn market, because sales are still narrow. However, the afternoon took on a slightly rising image. The transaction of the current cotton is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Another message: For foreign cotton, the New York cotton market was very active and firm in the early morning. Later, it returned and tired due to public purchases and some short covering. The closing price rose 45 pounds sound compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market fell two Robi yesterday along with the forecast, and the Egyptian cotton market rose more than 20 pounds sound.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton market continued to be unusually active yesterday. Although futures transactions were heard, they were not as active as spot goods. There are quite a few traders who are searching for 42 count raw materials. The market is extremely short of this type of raw cotton, so long fibers are currently more popular than general raw materials. The cotton market yesterday, converted at a rate of 5.9375 US dollars, is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e105">Grain: Rice Market Changes, From Tired to Firm and Firm Again, Foreign Rice Continues to Arrive in Shanghai <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Since the rice market was slightly frustrated in the previous dynasty, although the market prices of various goods have not risen or fallen much, people are tired of this situation. At the beginning of yesterday morning, the original wholesalers and peddlers had no intention of selling, and the sales field, whether inland customers or local shops, took the opportunity to act. At the same time, floating hoarders and scatterers, etc., who are generally mindful of the family, are fundamentally based on grabbing the lead, and when the market is constantly changing dramatically, they will sell the profitable goods one after another, so a lot of recycled goods were filled in the morning. Xiao Jiao was only 42.5 yuan, which has been almost a yuan since the previous market. However, after a fall, it can attract customers. Once the stores see the situation move, they will continue to do it, and the route will be opened up, and the shouting will rise, and the market will turn from tired to firm. In an instant, the original plate was restored, but the general trend was not healthy, and once it moved, it would be relaxed, and as the customers here would take advantage of the high push, it would cause some back winds, and under the pressure of environmental changes, there was no room for standing, and it retreated in bursts, and the market price of each cargo fell again, and from then on all the way down, and there was no opportunity to turn around, and the result was a depreciation of 6-7 jiao. It is estimated that the closing price of No. 1 West Buy is 47 yuan, Huowen is 46 yuan, and Xiao Jiao is 43 yuan. Only rice tea and mixed crushed rice are not much, and there is no rise or fall, and they stand guard on the original plate.</p>
<p>Due to the rain, the arrival of japonica glutinous rice has become less common, with a total of more than 1,000 bags, so the japonica rice market has not changed from the previous day, similar to the previous one, but glutinous rice is due to the rising prices of foreign rice in recent days, the market price standard distance is out of order, extremely low, and much cheaper than other goods, attracting large households to continue to collect, and the best-selling of cake shops and rice shops, the situation is tight, and the market price is raised by yuan. If Ao Te Yuan is sold at 41 yuan, the other common Dan goods are already 38-9 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign rice has arrived in Shanghai again. On the previous day (16th), the French postal ship company's irregular ship, from Saigon, transported 920 tons of foreign rice, including 80 tons of bag rice, which has been completely unloaded. The ship left Shanghai for Japan yesterday morning. Yesterday, there were Yihua foreign firms' Ding Sheng wheels, from Hong Kong, transported 1,447 bags of foreign rice, which were imported yesterday morning, and docked at the Roosevelt Pier for unloading. There were also 4,536 bags of foreign rice transported from the original ship to Tianjin. Also, Taikoo's Jiangsu wheels arrived yesterday afternoon, also transported 1,659 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. It is heard that Zhava company's Zhibosha is transporting a large number of foreign rice to Shanghai in Saigon, approximately on Monday (22nd). (Zu)</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market saw ups and downs. Recycled goods have been absorbed by North Gang and Chinese households inside and outside for days, and yesterday's production was also reported to rise again, and the seller shouted higher than before. Holders were willing to sell in June, and the price of No. 2 Saigon in April and May was 53.5 yuan, which was immediately raised by half a yuan to 54 yuan, and then from 54 yuan, a corner of two angles, to 54 yuan, a corner and a half. The buying spirit was lively, no less than the excitement of the exchange era. Market fluctuations are not entirely based on facts, and only if the buyer is greedy to do so, the market price will immediately go straight up step by step. The foreign rice market has long been regarded as the only object by speculators, so in the afternoon, after profits were released, it fell from 54 yuan a corner and two angles to 54 yuan, the closing price. Actual consumption of current rice is weak, and those who profit also spit out. Also, it was rumored that the Norwegian ship loaded with rice that was detained has been transferred to Shanghai in Hong Kong. People's hearts were fixed, and the selling price was initially set and then fell. The result was a small two-three corners.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Flour Mill Market Suddenly Rose by 3 Jiao <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The flour market suddenly turned to rising winds, because the factory side was due to the expensive raw material prices, and the pre-set foreign wheat was feared to be unable to be transported to Shanghai as scheduled, so the intention to sell was very firm. For the batch price of this street, after the sale period is over, it will be changed to 13.8 jiao, and then 3 jiao will be released. Yesterday was the 18th, and it has been another month since the end of the flat sale period, and it will be restored to a price of 13.8 jiao, and the recycled goods will also be brought up at the same time. It is heard that the old brand has risen from 13.5 jiao to 7.2 fen, and other mainland and Japanese flour mills are also thriving, and at the time when the gold market yarn flower rice prices are returning to loose, the flour market is increasing in shape, which is unexpected.</p>
<p>Wheat trading has become quiet again, because after a loose fall in the previous two days, the sellers have the intention of supporting because the inventory is dry and the foreign wheat price is expensive. However, the demand for factory customers is not smooth at the moment, and they generally choose the appropriate price. Therefore, it is difficult for the two sides to get close, and the market is in a stalemate again.</p>

<p>Recently, those who are in charge of coal on the market have taken advantage of the tense situation in Europe to fabricate rumors, saying that Norwegian merchant ships have stopped sailing, and that the arrival of coal to Shanghai has been affected, and as a result, coal prices have soared. The reporter made a special inquiry to various shipping agencies. It is heard that coal loading is not only dependent on Norwegian ships, but British, American, and Dutch ships are also loaded, and the British merchants' Maher ships load the most, so the source is not a problem. It is heard that a large number of Indian coal will arrive in Shanghai this month, and Vietnamese coal (i.e., Hongji Haiphong coal) will also continue to be transported. The details of the coal-carrying ships are described below. The manager of the foreign head office of Chahe foreign firm, Jeannette Shinner, loaded 7,090 tons of coal from Kalkata. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, but there was no news of import last night. According to the firm, it is said that there was a slight delay on the road, and it will definitely arrive in Shanghai in the next few days. Also, the manager of the bank, Marion Mollor, also loaded 5,563 tons of coal from Kalkata, and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. Also, the Zhongyi company's Enji wheels loaded coal from Hongji (the number is not clear) to Shanghai, and is expected to arrive today. Java company's Stagen, managed by Java company, loaded coal dust from Haiphong (number unclear), scheduled to arrive on the 22nd.

It is heard that there are many other wheels being cut and transported, and the ship names and import dates are not yet suitable for announcement. It is known that there are more than 36,000 tons, and the number is also considerable. The source of coal in this city can be said to be no problem at all. Yesterday, this newspaper published that two ships of Indian coal arrived in Shanghai on the 16th, one of which, the Dutch wheel S·S·Rantaupandjang, was wrongly published as Jeannette Shinner. The ship has not yet arrived in Shanghai and is expected to arrive in Shanghai in the next few days.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Textiles: Cotton Cloth Price Surge Resumes <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: Yesterday's price drop saw most hoarding merchants stand firm. Scattered sellers gradually cleared their cheap stock. Consequently, market confidence rebounded yesterday, and prices rose across the board. Fine cloth and fine twill experienced a sharp rise after falling steeply, with each bolt increasing by one to three yuan. Coarse cloth did not rise much. Lun Chang, Ewo, colored cloth, bleached cloth, and coarse cloth were quoted at steady prices. Sales among local merchants increased significantly, with wholesale stores and dyeing factories also starting to purchase. Total transactions amounted to over 800 pieces. Merchants from the Zhejiang (Ningbo-Wenzhou) region handled over 100 pieces of coarse cloth, colored cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill on the second floor. Merchants from Guangdong and Hong Kong handled 100+ pieces of twill, colored cloth, bleached cloth, coarse cloth, and silk. It was found that 520 bolts of cotton cloth were shipped to Ningbo yesterday (the 19th).</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, due to the rebound in the yarn market, confidence in cloth increased. The leading fine cloth in the market saw a gradual cleanup of scattered off-market holdings. Merchants increased their bids and new bullish investors emerged to absorb the supply, causing market sentiment to rise again. The morning session started at 42 yuan and rose to 43 yuan. Later, the spot price reached a high of 44.75 yuan before falling again. The closing price was 43.25 yuan. Next month's futures were at 46 yuan. "Four Gentlemen" Yuan Biji closed at 1.315 yuan per yard. The current month opened at 1.36 yuan, showing a firm trend.</p>

<p>(From a copy of this newspaper from the twelfth year of the Tongzhi reign of the late Qing Dynasty)</p>
<p>Talking About Other People's Fathers (2)</p>
<p>A young man wished to welcome his father back south, but the father said that his fields and ancestral graves were all in the north, and he could not bear to abandon his beloved homeland. The young man suggested that he would go south to bring the family north, to serve his parents day and night. The father was very pleased. However, day after day, the young man did not set out. Some suspected that his filial piety was not genuine, but that he was short of funds. One day, the father urged him to depart. The young man said, "I dare not speak falsely before you. The cost of the journey here was not substantial, but detours and searching for relatives along the way have consumed all the money. To travel with servants would require at least a hundred taels of silver. Please lend me the money, and I promise to return with my mother within a month, and will not cause you any further worry." The father had funds deposited in the Guang Mao Residence, so he discussed it with his employer. The employer wished to see the "true face of Mount Lu" (to get a clear picture), so the father led the young man to meet the employer as a junior friend. The employer treated him with the respect due to a noble guest, hosting a feast and showing respect, and arranged for him to stay at the Guang Mao Residence. The young man was refined and courteous, and the employer congratulated the father on having such a son, suggesting that he stay a little longer and that he would provide funds for his journey. However, the young man always went out with a silk fan and robe, strolling leisurely. When asked about his whereabouts upon his return, he would say that he had been to such and such yamen, such and such office, or such and such official's or secretary's place, but no prominent person ever came to visit. The next day, it was discovered that he had simply strolled aimlessly, with no destination, occasionally inserting himself into lively scenes, or spending six cash on a bowl of tea. His footsteps never touched the so-called offices or yamens. He would return at dusk, and his answers would be the same. The shopkeeper, observing from the sidelines, was clear about the situation and advised the father, "Judging from your son's actions, he is making many false claims. Just take his visits to the yamens as proof. If one thing is false, the rest are likely to be false too. Do not let greed cloud your judgment and fall into the trap of a scoundrel." The father suddenly realized the truth and gave the young man the cold shoulder. The young man, knowing that his scheme had been exposed, did not return to the Guang Mao Residence, but went to Yang Village, where he used sweet words to borrow some foreign money from his uncle and sister and fled.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Forty-Five Percent and One Fold <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Se</p>
<p>This time, the public bus fare has increased again. On the surface, it has risen from four cents to five cents per stop, which is an increase of one-fourth of the original fare, and it does not seem excessive. But in fact, the company has doubled the fare, which may seem unbelievable, and the newspapers have not paid attention to this point. Now I will prove it with facts:</p>
<p>Before the 15th, the fare for one stop was four cents, two stops was five cents, and three stops was six cents. What about now? One stop is five cents, but two stops jump to eight cents, and three stops jump to twelve cents. Compared with the original six cents, isn't that a difference of one fold? Every day I take the No. 9 bus from the intersection of Avenue Foch and Route Tenant to Avenue Edan, which is exactly three stops, and the fare is six cents. But now it has risen to twelve cents. Has our income ever increased by one fold like this?</p>
<p>In the past two years in Shanghai, prices have been rising constantly, but it is really frightening that the public bus fare has increased by 100%, and on the surface, it is still claiming to have only increased by 45%.</p>
<p>"Price increase" has already become an "accomplished fact," right? But between 45% and one fold, I hope the company authorities will carefully investigate this "price list." This is the lowest demand, and we are waiting for an honest reply.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Living with Illness <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Xinkui</p>
<p>The vast city of Shanghai nominally has a population of about four million, but in reality, if a careful investigation is conducted, I am afraid that the number of citizens who meet the health standards would not exceed half. In other words, there are more than two million citizens who are living with illness.</p>
<p>Just being able to eat and not feeling bloated in the stomach does not mean that one is a healthy person. A truly healthy person, apart from other conditions, must have all parts of the body in good working order: the limbs, torso, bones, brain, internal organs, nerves, blood, muscles, skin, hair, and nails must all be sound and flexible, without the slightest defect. People whose teeth often ache or whose toes always itch at night cannot be considered healthy. Even people who have no obvious signs of illness on the surface, but are not able to work for long periods of time, are easily tired, have an irregular appetite, and do not get enough sleep at night, cannot be classified as healthy.</p>
<p>People who live with illness not only suffer physically, but also feel threatened spiritually. How can there be any joy in living under pain and threat? Of course, no one wants to live with illness. There are many people in society who live with illness, and there are three reasons for this: (1) Some part of the body has been damaged, but the person is not aware of it; (2) The person knows that some part of their body has a problem, but they rely on their strong resistance and do not care; (3) The person knows that their illness is serious, but they are forced to work to make a living and cannot afford to see a doctor, so they can only watch their condition worsen day by day and resign themselves to fate.</p>
<p>Regarding the first type of people, if they are willing to have regular and thorough physical examinations and accept the doctor's guidance, taking medicine or recuperating, it is easiest to restore their health. Regarding the second type of people, if they can consult a doctor, the disease is also easy to eliminate; otherwise, concealing the illness is like committing slow suicide, and sooner or later they will suffer the consequences. As for the third type of people who are sick but cannot afford to see a doctor, they make up the largest number of patients. Their situation is most worthy of sympathy. Unfortunately, the current society is based on the worship of money. Whether it is hospitals, doctors, pharmacies, or drugstores, their greatest purpose is to make money. At most, they only use humanitarianism as a signboard. Therefore, poor people who are sick rarely have the opportunity to come into contact with medicine. Even if there are charitable clinics, there are very few completely free opportunities, and the treatment is not very thorough or effective.</p>
<p>Since "people" have the freedom to live, they should have the freedom to be healthy. At present, humans only have the "freedom to be sick."</p>
<h3 id="e112">New Stimuli <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Bu Ren</p>
<p>"Behind the vermilion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the road, corpses of the frozen starve to death." The present Shanghai is just a portrayal of these two sentences. The big restaurants are full of guests every day, and a table of dishes costing 100 yuan is considered ordinary. But the "dregs of humanity" who wait for several hours every day to receive two steamed buns are said to have reached 1.88 million in three months. Moreover, because they cannot even grab two steamed buns, they die of hunger and cold. Seeing that the trucks that come out of the Pushan Villa every day are fully loaded, there is no need to count these numbers.</p>
<p>However, these extremely few people are still appealing for relief. It seems that everyone else has not seen it (not because of nearsightedness, but because they are unwilling to waste their "eyesight"). They spend their leisurely twenty-four hours every day in casinos, dance halls, and theaters. But we can still hear them shouting "loneliness" because they need new stimuli.</p>
<p>Naturally, this "loneliness" must be resolved. For example, one day they will close the door, sit on the sofa, and play with a Pekingese dog to their heart's content. If they are tired of watching human dramas, watching dog dramas is also a way to adjust. Moreover, the grand occasion of "Haijingbo" is still deeply imprinted on their minds. So, five hundred pounds of beef, thirty loads of vegetables, and five hundred chickens make people excited because, judging from this daily food consumption, playing with Pekingese dogs on the sofa is even more extravagant.</p>
<p>Counting the days on their fingers, it is probably right now. However, this huge consumption may force people with empty stomachs to roll under the "horse's" belly to commit suicide. Can this "drama outside the drama" be said to be a killjoy, because this is what they do not want to see.</p>
<h3 id="e113">One-Sided Eggs <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Li Ren</p>
<p>Recently, the catering company that we contract with often uses eggs to make dishes. At first, we liked it very much because it is nutritious and delicious! However, later, there were eggs at almost every meal, which made us suspicious. Because eggs now cost more than a dime each, the catering company would never give us such expensive things at every meal. Later, I asked the person who delivered the meals. At first, he just smiled without answering. Later, after I repeatedly asked him, he said: "These are egg yolks bought from biscuit companies, and the price is very cheap." Ah! The catering company is using such a clever trick! Think about it, if the protein has been extracted by the biscuit company for making biscuits, then wouldn't these dregs be of no benefit at all? Now that prices are high, this of course makes the catering company cut corners, but we don't necessarily have to eat meat.

<h3 id="e114">Jesus' Concept of Gratitude (3) <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Jesus was like this. During the Last Supper, he firmly took the cup and gave thanks. He knew that the road ahead was rugged and difficult, but he also knew that it was the way to glory and reward because this journey would allow him to obtain eternal life. Jesus faced all the hardships and expectations of life with a joyful attitude, never turning back and never changing. This is the reason for his great personality and the origin of his grateful heart. Isaiah 45:2 says, "I will give you the treasures of darkness." This "you" refers to Cyrus. It means that Cyrus obtained glorious victory through adversity. From this sentence, we can think that anyone who is willing to fight can discover many treasures on the path of life. This is the gospel of the cross and Golgotha. It contains the beauty of words and the power of life. The British poet Tennyson wrote these words from experience: Life is not a mine of idleness, but a mine of iron, to be mined from the darkness, tempered with tears, and forged with blows. He himself was a great poet forged in this way. A joyful person, by striving to face and overcome his adverse environment, often becomes a person of great spiritual power. The most grateful people in the world are those who are willing to face the hardships of life and endure all the tempering of life. They can also see that in the darkness of life, there are endless treasures. Because of the various tribulations they have experienced, a sense of self-confidence and joy naturally arises in the depths of their hearts, transforming their ordinary lives into meaningful lives. In misfortune, gratitude can be produced. Therefore, we must have the experience of facing life, and then we will have true gratitude. There are countless people who are suffering and cannot see anything to be grateful for, but because of this misfortune, they can find true treasures. We should be grateful for this and imitate Jesus in thanking God for suffering. In gratitude, we can gain the courage to win in life. (End) If you want to study in detail, please write to P.O.

<p>Chapter 23: Old Friends and New Companions, Writing Has Value; Famous Scenic Spots, Management Finds the Right People</p>
<p>Let's continue. Zhai Wushuang, because he was talking about the newspaper office's side businesses, distinguished between publications and non-publications. Among the publications, they had various periodicals, magazines, standalone books, Chinese and foreign maps, and so on. Each year, the income from the publications was considerable. At that time, Wu Junsu asked, "Then what are the non-publications?" Zhai Wushuang said, "There are also many types of non-publications. Recently, our film business has also been very developed!" Zhai Wushuang, speaking to that point, pointed at Shao Huihua and said, "Oh! I almost forgot! We also have our movie star here." Shao Huihua said, "Okay! Okay! Don't talk nonsense! Continue with your story." Zhai Wushuang said, "Actually, we don't run any film companies, nor do we shoot any feature films. The films we shoot are mostly short films. For example, those about scenery, academics, industry, and customs are all called newsreels. At first, we shot a few reels of film, which were originally just shown to the people in our own newspaper office. Later, some people borrowed them to show them, and gradually they spread outside, and other places came to request them. So our newspaper office simply set up a film department. Whenever there are tours, sports meets, expositions, competitions, concerts, etc., held across the country during good days in spring and autumn, we send people to film them. In addition, if there are academic inventions that need to be shown through film, or if it's about a major domestic industry, such as the launching of a giant ship, the completion of a large bridge, airplane races, or realistic portrayals of mines, we also go to film them. As for the customs films of various borders and inland areas, we have also shot quite a few, which were commissioned by the Folk Customs Survey Committee. So recently, after each type of newsreel is produced, various places request them, some are pre-ordered, and some are purchased on the spot. Generally, when we produce a newsreel, we print many copies. So our side business of film news is quite developed. There is also another side business called the agency department, and the establishment of this agency department was also gradually successful. At first, a few writers published a few self-printed works and entrusted our newspaper office to sell them on their behalf. Later, a few inventors invented several new scientific instruments, and because it was not cost-effective for them to set up their own distribution departments, they also entrusted our newspaper office to distribute them on their behalf. These were all agreed to out of friendship. Who knew that the business of entrusting us to be their agent would become more and more numerous, and people all trusted us. We had no choice but to set up another agency location and assign a few more employees, and we even set up a sample room!" (265)</p>

<h3 id="e116">Jin Shaoshan and the Hegemon <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Sen</p>
<p>According to a Tianjin dispatch, Jin Shaoshan recently performed at the China Grand Theater, collaborating with Yan Huizhu and Zhou Ruian. The highest price for a ticket was one dollar and sixty cents, and for the play "Farewell My Concubine," an additional thirty cents was temporarily added to the ticket price. The posters were put up, and the tickets were sold out in no time. Jin Shaoshan's current fame and momentum are truly overwhelming, and certainly cannot be compared to when he was confined to the south!</p>
<p>The role of the Hegemon, played by martial arts actors, since the passing of Yang Lao Jiang, Zhou Ruian should be considered the best. Although Ruian's expression and performance are not as robust as Lao Jiang's, and his voice is not as crisp as Lao Jiang's, his tall stature and generous demeanor are still a typical choice. Therefore, when Kunqu Opera actresses perform "Farewell My Concubine" in the capital, they mostly pair with Ruian as the Hegemon, which shows that Ruian is also most skilled in the role of the Hegemon. The next best is Sun Yukun. Around 1929 and 1930, Yukun co-performed "Farewell My Concubine" with Xue Yanqin. At that time, Yukun was at his peak, and Yang Lao Jiang even considered him a disciple capable of carrying on his legacy. Although he later nearly declined for a time, since Lao Jiang passed away, Yukun has been quite interested in revitalizing, so in terms of martial arts actors playing the Hegemon, besides Ruian, Yukun is truly hopeful of succeeding Lao Jiang.</p>
<p>Among the rising martial arts actors, Gao Shenglin's skills are not weak, but unfortunately, his stature is relatively small, so it seems unsuitable for him to play the Hegemon. It is said that the child actor Chuan Dewei plays this role, and the Pingju circles in the capital say that he has the demeanor of a "little Hegemon among little Hegemons," so this child's future may also be promising.</p>
<p>Among Jing (painted-face) actors playing the Hegemon, Jin Shaoshan is the most famous. Outside of Jin, Liu Lianrong's skills are also not weak, and his voice is excellent, but unfortunately, his stature is not as majestic as Jin's, so when he co-performs with Dr. Mei, he always has to rely on thick-soled boots. Yuan Shihai also became famous for playing the Hegemon among the rising actors. Next are Sun Shengwen and Su Lianhan, who can perform steadily without flaws, but compared to Shaoshan, they are far inferior. It is appropriate that Shaoshan looks down upon the theater world with the air of the Hegemon and sees no one else in his eyes. There is a reason for increasing ticket prices. As for Chen Furui's oily Hegemon, Zhao Deyu's milk Hegemon, Ye Shengmao's soft Hegemon, Kunqu actress Wang Qingkui, Zhang Zishou's female Hegemon, and Kunqu Opera troupe Hou Yilong's old Hegemon, they are almost farcical and inevitably disrespectful to the hero! Sakyamuni Starts Filming New China's Film Agreement</p>
<h3 id="e117">Silver Screen Anecdotes <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Hai Xing</p>
<p>Sakyamuni Starts Filming New China's Film Agreement "Yanmen Pass" has been completed, and preparations are now underway to begin filming "Sakyamuni." It is tentatively scheduled to lead a location shooting crew to India in three months to capture the scenery of the Buddhist kingdom. The female lead was originally set to be Chen Yunshang, but now there may be changes. It is planned to invite Shani, the young daughter of the martial artist Lang Deshan, who has traveled around the world, to take on the role. It is said that Miss Shani has a long face, a high nose, and a slender figure, quite in the style of a Westerner. What's more valuable is that she is skilled in classical dance, which is exactly what is needed in "Sakyamuni." It is said that Shani is quite interested in appearing on the silver screen, but she cannot speak fluent Mandarin, which may be an obstacle to the future of negotiations.</p>
<p>Yunshang Telegraphed Shanghai for Leave Chen Yunshang was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai around the 20th of this month, but yesterday a telegram was sent to Zhang Shankun requesting a postponement, because the film being shot in Hong Kong has not yet been completed, but it did not specify which film. As far as reporters know, the film in which Chen is starring in Hong Kong is "The Flirtatious Empress" ("Liang Hongwang") is still in preparation. Zhang sent a reply telegram, asking her to stay for a few more days.</p>
<p>Wang Xichun Will Return to Shanghai Yesterday, Wang Yin sent a letter to the reporter, which contained a rather interesting passage: "Today, I went to the toilet in the Gloucester Tea Room twice, and both times I ran into Mei Lanfang also urinating. It was really coincidental. Mei Lanfang has gained a lot of weight. Standing next to me, I looked carefully at the wrinkles on his forehead. He didn't shave off all the stubble on his palms. He doesn't look like he will sing female roles anymore."</p>
<p>According to reports from Hong Kong friends: Wang Xichun is scheduled to return to Shanghai by ship on the 17th and should arrive around the 20th.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Tang Ruoqing Will Return to Shanghai <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>It was previously rumored that Tang Ruoqing was going abroad, but this statement has been confirmed to be incorrect. Ruoqing will return to Shanghai from Hong Kong next week. There are two reasons for Ruoqing's early return to Shanghai: one is that Huaiqiu will be holding a memorial service for his deceased father at the Jing'an Temple next Friday, and the granddaughter should arrive. The second is that China Travel will be staging the historical drama "Wen Tianxiang," and Ruoqing will play one of Wen Tianxiang's two daughters with Ruoying. It is also rumored that a certain film company intends to invite Ruoqing to appear on the silver screen, but this matter will have to wait until she returns to Shanghai to be decided.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Hua Yun in "Battle of Taiping" is a Mistake for Hua Yun (Part 2)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the character in the play who introduces himself insists on "being flowery rather than flourishing". Reasoning and logic absolutely do not allow him to mispronounce his surname. Therefore, the "Hua" character must be sung in the even tone. Some people say that in ancient characters, "Hua" (花) and "Hua" (華), "Jing" (景) and "Ying" (影), "Shi" (史) and "Shi" (事) were indistinguishable. Jing Gu Lonely Blood, if I were to call them Ying Mei Jiu, Ying Gu Lonely Blood, I'm afraid I would be scolded. If I write Shi Kefa as Shi Kefa, I would be spanked even more. When I first talked about "Battle of Taiping," I wanted to correct the error of "Hua" (花) and "Hua" (華), but at that time, I wanted to preserve the good melody of the three characters "General Hua Yun," and I was afraid that changing the tones of the characters would change the melody, which would be a pity. Who knew that after many days of studying and pondering, I actually found that singing the "Hua" sound was even more pleasant to the ear. I just changed the silent "ah" sound under the character "Hua" to three silent "ah" sounds under the character "Hua." When singing, it goes from low to high, and then from high to low (that is, the first and third "ah" characters are low, and the middle character is high). Also, when the "Hua" sound is produced, it goes from low and slow to high and urgent. The moment the last silent "ah" sound is produced, it connects to singing the character "Yun." Not only is the surname not wrong and the character not reversed, but it is also low and roundabout, with a vigorousness that contains the subtlety of immediate release and recovery. As for the "Jiaohua An Yu Fu Dai Zuoqi" in the previous section "Biejia," it is more appropriate to use the "Hua" sound under the character "An." If you sing the "Hua" character, then the tune under the character "An" will not come out. What do you think of this?</p>
