<h3>英國正式通吿日本　十八日重開緬甸路　邱吉爾同時在下議院宣布　英日兩國關係將急劇轉變</h3>
<p>倫敦　首相邱吉爾，今日在下院發表關於戰局之言論時、會宜布目前之英、日封鎖緬甸公路協定滿限後、將不丹繼　、謂三個月前、吾人被請封鎖此路、當時因吾人甚願予中、日兩政府以機會、　兩國問長久不決之爭執、司達到公平之解決、故予以贊同、不幸此種解決並未達到、目日人欲征服中國民族之延長戰專、仍進行不已、吾人雖深憾時機之錯過、而央政府在各項情形之下、主張仍仟該項協定存在至十月十七日、惟逾此期限之後、則實未見有其繼續之理由云、又謂、日本最近加人之三國公约、似頗不利於日本、渠意不知是否尙有若干秘密之條款、德·義究將以何種方法援助日　、殊不易瞭解、此公约係直接以美國為目的、而蘇聯次之、但英美對於威脅向不表示屈服、（八日路通社電）</p>
<p>今日正式通知日本英國業巳決定十月十八日重行放緬甸公路、外務省於下午五時宣稱、英國大使克萊琪依其政府之飄令、特訪外相松岡、據稱、英政府在英·日關於對鎖緬甸公路之協定期滿之後、重行開放此一路綫、實不知其何以不可　、關於此一點、各方咸信英·日關係將有急速轉變、誠以日本旣已簽訂三國同盟、復又宣言決定抑制助華國家、是英重啟此一對華重要通商路綫、自必視為對日之敵到行為也、此間並父表示、緬甸公路開放之事、亦將促使日·美關係惡化、　日人以為央國所取態度、華盛頓　以促威、美難逃其負任、（八日合衆社電）</p>
<p>東京　據外務省發表文吿云、英大使克萊琪爵士、今晨會訪晤松岡外相、通知英國不　繼續封鎖緬甸公路之協定、此項文吿甚為間略、官方拒絕批評、惟預料將有正式抗議、按上週日本各報曾强烈暗示日機山越南根據地轟炸緬甸路之可能性、日人皆信英方軍行開放緬甸公路之通知、將不影響央方之禁止軍事及其他接濟品取道香港前往中國、日本時報認、英國之決定重行開放重慶接濟品唯一剩餘之動脈、係欲在華人之前挽同顏面」、並以援助重慶為與美國共同抵抗日本之唯一力量、衆料日本抗議英國此項決定理由、大约係認此舉為違反兩國所訂三個月封鎖協定之精神、因其內容對於擴展封鎖之可能性、會有缄默之諒解、日本或更認此舉為違反去年有田、克萊琪恊定之文字與精神、蓋根據其規定、英國承認日本對華之特殊地位及需要、並聲明無仟何意嚮援助日人之敬方、（八日路透社電）</p>
<p>英大使訪蘇聯外長檢討整個遠東形勢</p>
<p>倫敦　路透社昨夜探悉、英相邱吉爾日內將發表關於緬甸公路事之言論、十月十七日期滿之英·日協定、規定在此協定有效時期中、應設法就遠東問體作一般解決、今日本旣不向此方面進行、目進兵越南、以　側攻中國、並絲結三國盟約與英國之</p>
<h3>美加緊對日　經濟制裁</h3>
<p>東京　據「日日新聞」轒稱、美國禁止銅·鋼·煤·油等項輸入日木後、將禁止日本生絲、輸入美國、然美日關係、未必因此破裂、此項措置、僅構成美日絕交各項因素之一環而巳、該報希望印度及澳大利亞、加入遠東經濟集團云（八日海通社電）</p>
<p>紐約　自本日始、美國全國各城市（居民不滿五千者除外）之選民、着手進行登記之手續、（八日海通電）敵為伍、絕未採對英友好之態度、聞諸消息靈通方面、英政府於研究現有協定期滿俊英國所應行之途徑時、與美國已有密切接觸、監德義日盟的大半為對美而作、此固衆所公認者也、日方要求展長比協定期限之說、並未證實、東京近且發表言論、以為日軍由越南進仃戰事、乃可能事、緬甸公路午飛　轟炸範圍之內　故此路不能甬行　英相邱吉爾將於協定期滿時宜布緬甸公路之開放、此乃似　可疑者、英·美對遠東之政策、旣彼此相同、而兩國政府復不斷的交換意見、是以今可斷定英國已將其　放緬甸公路之意見通知善國矣、（八日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　比間昨晚宣示、英國駐莫斯科大使克里浦斯、於上星期五夜會與蘇外長莫洛托夫互作長時間之商談、衆信、英大使當向蘇外長表示英政府巳決定於十月十七日重開滇緬公路，據衆人揣則、此　外交官並會將日本加入三國聯盟後之整個遠東形勢、加以檢討、（八日合衆社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　日駐英大使重光葵、昨與英外次白特勒曾談頗久自日本簽就三角聯盟條约以還、重光葵拜　英外部、尙為首次　據衆所知該二人所談之事、不出　角聯　與英·日關係範圍之外云據則、白特勒曾向日大使表示英國重開滇緬公路之決定、惟正式之官方通吿、則將由英駐日大使克萊琪送　東　政府、（八日合衆社電）</p>
<h3>羅斯福定週末　宣布美外交政策　英大使訪美國務卿長談　兩國遠東合作計劃決定</h3>
<p>華盛頓　英駐美大使洛齊安、昨在此間與國務卿赫爾作長時間之談話、討論關於英美在遠東之問題、英大使於會談後吿報界稱、渠與赫爾氏嘗「充分交換關於世界局勢之情報」、然渠拒絕實布此次討論之內容、若千觀察家相信、昨日之會晤、係對英美在遠東合作之計劃作最後之決定、該項計劃或將於本星期由羅斯福總統及邱吉爾首相加以宣布、羅斯福總統將於本星期六發表關於美國外交政策之重要聲明、同時邱吉爾氏亦準備於本週內向下院演說、英大使昨日吿報界稱、渠對於英國決意重開滇緬公路、以便運輸戰爭原料往重慶政府一事、尙未獲得官方之通知、（八日合衆社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　昨日此間外交界之活動集中於遠東時局、英大使洛齊安赴國務院與赫爾唔談後、不願宜布其所談者是吾包括緬甸公路開放問題、未幾國務副卿威爾期接見法大使亨利海、同時海軍部長諾克斯訪美海軍總司令李却遜、聞討論「海軍例行事件」、惟此事件當然與太平洋有關、（八日路透社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　美國艦隊總司令李却遜海軍上將、自舊金山乘機抵此後、昨在此間與海長諾克斯上校會談、諾克斯上校過後語人、渠所接得者乃「艦隊之日常報吿」、諾克斯稱、「吾等並負討論太平洋之形勢及關於擴展美國海軍之一切事宜」參加此項會議者、尙有海軍次長富立斯塔爾、及海軍助理部長可姆登、（八日合衆社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　美海軍在海上及在陸地之各領袖、昨與海長諾克斯會商太平洋緊急局勢、以及兩洋艦隊擴充程序、而幾乎無日不開會之國務卿赫爾與英、澳使國之領袖、鑒於遠東局勢之重要、亦於昨日又舉行會議一次、諾克期與其屬下商談完畢後、官方稱、「艦隊之常例報吿已接獲、太平洋局勢已討論、而關於海軍擴充之事宜亦經討論、」同時聞官方傳、軸心國在遠東將立卽採取新行動、但究係何種行動、則尙未明、（七日國際社電）</p>
<p>東京　朝日新聞今日載社論曰、自日本宣布東亞新秩序後、英、美維持堅强之反對、此巳盡人皆知矣、吾人常然不欲引起無謂之衝突、惟吾人之程序、因此反對將永不能吿成、亦屬　然之事、三國盟約實為吾人所急需者云、（八日路透社電）</p>
<p>東京　日本報紙今日重申日本之決定、謂將「不顧」英、美「千涉、遠東、而將日本「大東亞新秩序」之計劃加以推進、結果如何、在所不顧朝日新聞對外相松岡洋右昨在此之演辭表示贊許、外相曾稱、一日本決不令央、美之阻碍將吾人之目的戰敗、」該報稱、吾人所可為之事、僅為向的推進、決不任人加以阻止、該報並云、日本目宜示其建立「東亞新秩序」之意向後、英國即根　其「根深蒂固之維持現狀」之理論、以決定其行動、該報繼言、「日本在此地帶進行共存共榮之工作、何以大受英、美二國、允共　　之反對、實屬大惑不解焉、（八日台衆電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>蘇聯態度的檢討</h3>
<p>國際形勢發展到了現階段。張立必至於爆發為世界大戰。但觀察各方情况。昆張雖近極點。大戰還非即在目前。蓋各國的實際準備與布置，尚未完成；而蘇聯從目前的態度演進而到明確的境界，也不能期之太急迫。蘇聯極持重，而各國正以蘇聯為追求的核心：大約追求分曉之日，便是大戰開始之時吧！</p>
<p>誰者不能預言蘇聯到大戰開始的前夕為止，將取何種態度，但我們不防從頭檢討，從旁分析，試窺其究竟。不必說得太遠。從一九二六年十一月德日締結所謂反共協定起，經一年而至次年十一月義國參加協定：於今三四年間，蘇聯在外交上對付這三國，眞可謂步步成功。原來蘇聯自史太林氏當家之後，專心致志，埋頭於國內建設，他所迫切需要的祗是和平。德義日三國望而生畏，於是締結一反共公約一意在互相合作，防止第三國際的破壞工作；亦即蘇聯在國際上活動，同時博取英美的反蘇份子的同情，以掩護其　武侵略的滋長。蘇聯看破了這一點，為了保障自己的存在，便不能既定出國際舞台之外，從待反蘇陣綫的强大鞏固，不能坐待最後的進攻；於是亦從外交上，多方積極起來。綜合這三四年來，蘇聯在「和平外交」，「集體安全」，「援助正義戰」，「反對帝國主義戰爭」等各種不　口號下。積極的發揮其功能，消極的躲避了自己對外關係上的危機。直到今天，牠的收穫是：（一）亞歐兩局戰爭之中蘇聯仍然沒有被捲進去。（二）自身强大的物質基礎奠定了充實且鞏固了。（三）東與中國，南與土耳其，樹立了誠信相孚的友好基礎；更於其丁邊。由北冰洋起，一直到黑海止，經建起了一道堅强的外圍綫。（四）由孤立的危境，經不多歲月，經幾個轉變，便臻舉足專輕的地位，翹然而為各方追求的目標了。祇此四端。雖在深惡痛絕他的人們，亦不能不讚歎其成功吧！何以得此成功？他能（一）利用「有」殖民地國家其與「沒有」殖民地國間的矛盾。（二）抑揚於侵略者與弱小國家民旗間的矛盾。（三）尤其重要的。在「有」的彼此間，以及「沒有」的彼此間。把握其矛盾。簡單言之三四年來，蘇聯外交的勝利，是完全寄託在整個國際關係在空間的多方複雜性，以及在時間的先後參差情。</p>
<p>到了現階段，德義日三國正式宣佈了同盟，至少在最近數年（未必十年）之間。三國勢必共其進退，使國際複雜性中重要的一環，趨於簡單化了。蘇聯在行動上，在政策上，對於這三國，將被逼而逐漸趨歸一揆；終必有這一時期的到臨，即對於三國，不是全百的一友或「敵」？祗有追隨三國之後，加入集團，成為分贓的夥伴之一；幫助他們造成根本違反自己立國基本的壁田園，却使自己孤立於極右的火　包圍之中；凶終隙末，翻臉為敵，成為最後的定命。何謂全面「中立」？三國若竟漸次得勢，必至對於蘇聯要求對中國援助的停止，對土耳其友好關係的斷絕，遮斷美蘇間的脈絡；那時候，蘇聯若以苟安為得計，仍以「中立」為標榜，則接受要求之日，立即等於甘願退出國際舞台，然後坐待別人勝負定局後，再來俯首接受對於自己的判決。</p>
<p>上述兩途，當非過慮，當危辭，其間確實包涵豐富的可能性。或說蘇聯不但極持重，且極聰明，他有超人一等的神機妙算：譬如說，現在不妨從旁促成資本主義世界的火拼，一到相當時機，垂手而獲更大的漁翁之利；這不是絕計嗎，何必現在分什麼友敵？其間關鍵，乃在蘇聯的力量在前呢？超越國界的社會戰爭，姑不評論其是非短長，但在一個國族對外發動或遭遇了民族戰爭的時候，社會戰爭便因民族意識而消弭了：故世界革命的可能性。實比世界大戰的可能性為小。這至少是今後一二十年內必必如此的。小而言之，去年的蘇芬戰爭，可以做一個好例。這在蘇聯，早已發見這一理論，即革命不是可以移植的東西；僅由外力使一國發生革命是不可能的，何况使全安乐！可見借箸代籌而為蘇聯　絕計。事不可行。</p>
<p>倘若前論不謬則推論蘇聯與德義日三國之間的前途，必然以全面敵對為結論，在敵對的根本方向之上，蘇聯或與英美流底携手，或部份携手？立即携手，或將來携手？這是目前僅存的歧路！</p>

<p>德國空軍雖沒有悠久的歷史，但其組織，變遷，進步，和主持空軍建設的幾個主要人物，都値得世人注意。茲將紐約泰晤士報及時代週報的紀載，譯述如次：一德國空軍在這次大戰中的重要性，雖不能估計太高，但已由向業的輔助地位，一躍而成為今日對英單獨進攻的主要利器，這是很明顯的了。五年之前，希特勒責任戈林從事建設空軍。戈林在上屆歐戰中，本是一員航空健將，擔任著名「利區沙芬」航空隊指揮。他以最大的努力，哺育提携，卒造成了今日銳利無比的空中作戰利器。德空軍最初的唯一目標，厥在進攻敵人，在敵軍後方，把所有交通，輺重，給養和生產中心，一舉殲滅，以待陸軍進攻時，可收風捲殘雪之效。</p>
<p>德空軍現已不必與陸軍取得合作，個可完成獨富一面的責務。令日德軍大舉襲央，便是貫澈道種作風的表演。在英國地面上，尙無德軍的一兵一卒，而德國空軍却不顧一切，出以斷然的攻擊。楚吾單靠空軍卽可判明兩國軍事上的勝負，現在猶在未知之天。不過據德國軍事觀察家意見，目下連絞不斷的對英轟炸，在陸軍沒有登岸之前，可以搖動敵人的抵抗能力。</p>
<p>德空軍為造成其單獨作戰的地位起見，其編制中一切取自備自足的方法。凡是空軍作　所必要的各棟配備，莫不應有書有。德空軍中自設通訊隊，自置救護設備，而月有「空軍步兵」，利用降落傘，在敵軍後方配備作戰，堅守據點，以待主力軍隊的到來。這些都是德空軍的唯一特色。</p>
<p>德空軍的造成今日地位，自當歸功於戈林等人。其醞釀遠在十年之前，但實際上人的訓練，或機械的製造，則肇始於一九三五年。所以德國空軍的建設，其歷史亦祇五年而巳。主其事者為戈林，和他的親信人物米爾奇。戈林是設計者，希特勒是贊助者，而這米爾奇却是實行，組織者，所以他的功績也甚偉大。</p>
<p>戈林與米爾奇相遇於國社黨組織之始。戈林在上屆大戰中，任職於利區沙芬男爵著名的航空隊。米爾奇初為砲兵軍官，後為國營航空公司的總裁。他矮矮身材，精神飽滿，就其外表來看，很有美國精明幹練的商人氣息。在草創之初，箄路藍縷，煞費苦心。德國本是個窮困國家，當時又受凡爾塞和的束縛，不能設立空軍。一九三三年國社黨執政，航空部長戈林任米爾奇為航空交通司長。米爾奇令驍勇戰將烏台脫脫離電影事業入航空部供職，共同樹立空軍楷模，嗣後卽着手訓練靑年航空人員十萬名，及防禦空襲之人員一千一百同僚亦有反對之者。他辦專方式，多少帶些生意人「求急利」的作風，而缺少德國軍人的特殊格調。他的性格不像武人的峻嚴緊毅，而帶有幾分溫文圓米雨奇尙有兩個同僚，也是傑出人才，一個是凱塞琳，一個是史寶爾。他們和戈林及米爾奇一樣，都是上將銜。凱塞琳在上屆大戰時，與米爾奇萬人，其中句括防空隊員，機務人員，及後備人員。初級學校中靑年學生，亦授以航空知識，滑翔飛行又為民間極普通的運動。一九三五年，希特勒公然宣佈　設空軍，訓練人才，開設工廠，及設計製造飛機。關於飛機製造的設計，當初卽規定以少數式樣，作為統一製造的標準，由容克期，杜尼爾，亨格爾，及梅塞斯密特，四家主要工廠大量製造。此種統一標準大批生產方法，卽　米爾奇之最初計劃。客克　　七式機為其所獨賞之　國　品，此機設計乃烏台脫自　國海軍方面取得者。</p>
<p>米爾奇雖身居要職，然其通的胎息。高級國社　員對於他的出身至今還懷疑着，他父親是猶太人。希特勒倒非常愛好而親仟他，會授以國社黨榮譽金質別針。</p>
<p>相同，也是任砲兵軍官。一九三五年改入航空部。侵波之役，他參與戎機，並指揮第一隊空軍作戰。他身材魁梧，天機活潑，原是巴伐利亞產，可說得德國空軍中最為人所重視的一個高級將領。</p>
<p>史寶爾完全是普魯士軍人色彩——堅實嚴肅，單純　斷。上屆大戰時，在飛機中為　人擊落，身受重創。西班牙內戰之役，他率領空軍，援助弗朗哥作戰，數百德軍精銳駕駛員，亦在其指導之下，實地演習戰術。此外，德空軍中尙有一中心人物吉訶納將軍，會在一九三七年繼威佛將軍，任德空軍參謀總長。</p>
<p>目下德國空軍的實力究竟如何，局外人不得而知。據戰前估計，一九三九年末，德空軍第一綫的有飛機八千架至一萬架。四年以來，德飛機製造量增加甚速。開戰以來，亦未見低减。所以上述的數目，當不至於不足，甚且還要超越呢</p>

<p>後市收買頓濃</p>
<p>後市因有利多傳說、市况轉緊、港電突來扒進、外行現貨美滙五元七一八七五、後有利吃胃陡濃、吸收投機商十月份美滙五元七一八七五、時現美滙會軟至五元六八七五、迄晚收英金三辦士六八七五、美滙五元七一八七五十一月份英金三辦士六七一八七五、美滙五元六八七五、結果比上日英滙現期均鬆〇三一二五、美則俱無榮辱、</p>

<h3>新多活動　金價欲跌又止</h3>
<p>咋日現金烚赤暗盤、晨初虛弱、後則隨滙市轉緊而回高、市氣已趨堅穩、結果反稍吿漲、蓋初以承上日疲風、再加滙市明暗放長、故一時賣氣頗濃、允以錢兌業銀號兩帮拋空較力、一度曾創見五千五百七十五元新近最低價、旋幸外滙回緊、新多買戶活動、證券帮銀號見勢補空、目傳美大西洋駐軍有撤回原防消息、故迄傍晚遂回漲至五千七白二十五元、結果收盤亦有五千七百十五元、比上日軋升十元、全天交易的四千兩以上、銀樓飾金終則吿平、海關金等呆定、</p>
<p>烚赤反漲十元</p>
<p>晨初滙市鬆動、市勢軟弱、開市卽在落五十五元、銀號出金號十兩、遜為五千六百五十元、機因證券帮及銀號猛售、且一時外滙步鬆、買者裹足、立慘入五千六百元關、退至五千五百九十元、旋滙市稍定、買戶始見活動、頭寸立感求過於供、中以證券帮補空、及銀號新多購買占多、驟回升至五千六百六十元、卒因滙市復鬆、金號及錢兌業等爭先力吐、斯時另一銀號忽來拋空極夥、重被壓小至五千五百七十元低價、十一時後、外滙止鬆稍回、市勢復現硬化、銀號多頭加碼、證劵帮東來補空、收盤前復回高至五千六百六十元、惟午收稍挫、為五千六百四十五元、午後開市、賣者極少、遂抬至五千六百七十元開盤、嗣雖錢兌業證券帮吐出、會跌至五千六百四十五元、但未幾滙市報緊、買風陡起、銀號帮等在吸允力、立升至五千七百十元、此後買風曾息、又跌至五千六百八十元、奈滙市續吿軟化、證券帮銀號猛扒補空、少數、竟由空翻多、而多方乘機拾價遂漲至五千七百二十五元、收盤前浮多稍有了結、會回落三十元、惟人心似巳轉佳、低價買戶頗多、故晚收重升至五千七百十五元、結果比上日反漲十元、全天一百五十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金跌後又回</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出、十時三十分掛小十元、午後三時半回高十元、結果大同行仍懸五百九十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣先跌後回</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤跌後轉漲、英美金鎊、亦係先跌後回平、英金票因黑市英滙美長、下跌五角、美金票始會退至十六元八角半、後因紛傳國際局勢好轉、故人心又復向榮、午後抬至十七元三角、但比上日仍小五分、香港票因港滬滙兌步跌、各方供給頗旺、市價繼績猛跌、日金票供求均勻、市價站平、晚市仍站一元四角五分原盤、朝鮮票略趨疲軟、晚市為一元一角五分、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米漲跌頻仍　新粳到貨不弱</h3>
<p>米市轉呈徘徊之局面、昨則初開以隔日午後疲勢、人心尙虛、浮戶繼起出籠、同時銷塲堪稱寂寞、加以途貨相繼到申、大票定貨亦可不日抵埠、且滙水又鬆、續定通劃、市面隨在人心虛軟、與新粳湧到中續跌一元至一元三五角、最低時、二號西貢祇開六十五元、二號邏雜六十三元、小絞六十二元半，不過經此一跌、頗有來廉活動、不獨空頭如此、卽一般實銷、亦多採辦、霎見買氣轉旺、市色回緊、結果較前略貶元砠而已、計一號西貢為七十一元半、二號西貢六十六元、次至六十五元半、二號邏羅六十四元半、六十四元、小紋六十三元半六十三元、米蒃五十四元八角、六十四元、蕪湖尖六十二元、惟午後因滙水回縮、貨方不肯輕晚、且有汕幫問津、故上午回範二號西貢原包巳一度開七十七元半後、又扳價至七十八元、年後至七十八元半、現米乃亦跟起五六角、結果較前市仍小七八角、一號西貢開七十一元半七十一元、中六十九元半、二號六十五元八角至六十四元半、邏羅二號六十三元半至六十二元七角、火絞七十一元半至七十元、小紋六十三元至六十二元半、全日開出現米五千包、原包二百噸、</p>
<p>洋米又有到滬、太古公司安徽輪前晚（七日）七時許到埠、自香港裝來二千七百六十四包、停靠法租界外灘本行碼頭起卸、</p>
<p>糯米國洋兩貨供求相仿、未有榮辱、厚薄破粳到貨雖絕、市貨亦稀、然以價貴已極、不易脫手、况被他貨相　、致並落元砠、開南港斛早稻八十七元、次至八十五元、</p>
<p>新粳尖及窖種到貨、續有二三千石、惟中羊尖忽以斷貨聞、故羊尖無市、杜尖所到有限平平、售七十元、次至六十五元半、新粳及窖種則以到銷不勻、帶疲元砠、開閔行新粳七十九元至七十七元、西塘窑種七十八元、七十七元半、角里香粳昨又有上市、開八十二允、</p>
<h3>大批洋粉將到</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨市由堅轉平、查廠方所定洋麥、為數有限、故生產不足、批出之數量、仍舊稀少、不敷本街之需用、所以早成軋現之勢、昨日本街批價仍為十六元半原盤、而客盤巳須十八元五角、客幫稍有添辦、但為數亦微、至於回籠老車粉交易、則以大批洋粉將到、人心漸趨寗靜、故買賣又靜、洋粉亦微鬆二三角、價的十八元四五角云、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日小麥明定暗佾、緣路途裝運困難、且車船到貨零落、日廠依然限價二十一元收進、華廠亦因貨稀而不願放價吸收、至於租界方面、因有內地幫及囤戶採辦、故喊價曾有二十七元、然亦無成議、形勢尙在醞釀中、</p>
<h3>紗花　投機一致傾進　紗價不易下落</h3>
<p>紗市又入迴旋之途、但人心尚稱不惡、因香港幫對於十支粗紗需要依然不衰、同時投機有一致傾向購進，所以外匯雖步步放長、然買方心氣未見退落、就目前狀况測之、做多看高者居多數、因之市面不易鬆懈、檢查市塲上情形、據云有人做作、只見其大、不見其小也、今日有棉紗五百九十五件運香港、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、市上人氣未見虛弱、大衆意見、下落仍傾向拖進、故叫價雖小、然賣者仍屬寥寥無幾、二十支雙馬首盤價為一千一百七十元、一霎聞漲至一千一百八十五元、旋聞美滙大長、金子幫及搶帽子之輩、紛紛吐出、市盤又復回挫、跌至一千一百五十五元、但乘低時獲利者扒補、多方又見活動、市盤漸漸回升至一千一百六十七元、收盤以後再漲十元、查半日間成交統計五千三百五十五包、行情跌十元、茲將各幫口買出之額量、分列如左、一同行四、四〇〇　香港　九五五統計五、三五五</p>
<h3>同業居奇　棉花有行無市</h3>
<p>現棉交易、形同停頓、此因外滙日見放長、但紗市時起時仆、以致人心高低不一、不過最近以來紗價漲起量度、　屬不少、花價比例較紗為鮮、所以執貨者極小願放手、乃遂呈有行無市矣、</p>
<p>通州　一九二·〇〇　森太近　九七包</p>
<p>康笛許　二一九·〇〇　永記德　一〇件</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、參差不齊、因各方靜候政府將於明日公佈之田畝報吿昨日稍有南方套賣、結果收盤價格較之上日小一二磅音、印度連同價測漲一羅比餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日稍形靜寂、實因市上存底不足、同業心思聲昂、俱不願出樣兜銷也、廠方購意頗濃、竟難購得之苦、滙兌之鬆長、並不影響棉市且反見高昂也、</p>
<h3>證券　丙箽種至十除中籤　兩小時復原價</h3>
<p>六里厘英金債抽籤　外股先跌而後漲</p>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况上午平平略疲、惟丁種獨小、、與上午連中籤價相同、可見除中籤後需要忽殷、且午後四十一號買氣極盛、竟未能壓小市也、昨日上午、賣氣較湧、二十四號賣出二十餘萬、聯益亦有脫手、惟信昌聚豐買進、市價乃之殃象、當時四十一號賣氣極濃、仁昌賣出亦不少、而買方尤覺踴躍、同順同康潤德順昌聯益鴻大先後紛紛吸收、丙種仍穿出八元、二小時之相隔、而抽角、乙種尚漲起二角、成交約有二百萬元、茲列簡明戈於後、</p>
<p>民國廿三年六　英金庚款公債第十三次抽籤、業於本月一日在滬舉行、計抽中五十鎊債票一百張、一百鎊債票二百張、一千鎊債要四十九張、應還本金共計英金五萬四千鎊、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交南洋兄弟烟草公司股一百股、價為十六元三角、</p>
<p>昨日衆業股市開盤仍軟、價較前收略低、不久多頭了結者又如潮湧、各股價格再度在瀉、會德豐跌勢分外猛烈、最低價竟做至六十六元、直至嚮午因所傳消息較佳、同時滙市趨緊、價格始有轉機、下午經一度極短促之獲利了結後、市况更形進步、收盤各股俱有良好買戶、會德豐猛退疾升、收盤回至七十四元半、其他著名股亦有相當回風、橡皮股允其是荷印各公司股成交極多、</p>
<p>倫敦七日（週一）電、今日中國外債及遠東　商各公司股票掛牌行市、仍吿平滯、祇滙豐銀行股獨呈起色、計英倫註冊漲一鎊、價為六十七鎊、又香港註冊股漲三鎊、價為七十四鎊、其餘不動、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆市氣動搖</h3>
<p>邇來黃豆市况、自被油價帶起、去路尙不寂寞、故市風頗挺秀、但近兩日本街銷塲、因有近鄉來源接濟、且在市塲中略有回出、油價亦復挫小、壁壘動搖、統計做開靑島豆四百包、價為三十六元六角、又新豆二百包、價為四十一元、大塲豆五十餘包、價為三十四元至三十五元三角、</p>
<h3>疋頭　布疋又在收進</h3>
<p>昨日布市、以粵港帮納胃健旺、人氣重振、囤戶亦止賣買、各布晨市平平、午後漲起每疋二角半之譜、本街成交坯布五百餘件、漂染布絨　粗布二白餘件、粵港帮辦色布斜綫呢等貨三四百件、北路烟臺等帮辦重磅粗布等貨一百數十件、本街內地批發、因運輸困難，成交仍感稀少、今日布疋一千一百三十件運香港、昨日有五百十件運烟臺、</p>
<p>東布　先跌後漲、市勢轉堅、十二磅龍頭細布、上午收盤、每疋價為三十五元九角、下午本街同業進意濃厚、拉提甚力、步升至三十六元七角收盤、四君子嗶嘰晨盤降至一元〇六分半、後市同升至一元〇九分、</p>
<h3>絲茶　廠經見新低價</h3>
<p>昨國外絲市無巨大變動、紐的現期二貨無上落、橫濱現貨小五元、遠期不動、本　綜市、則忽起跌風、聞白廠　七十八分巳售開五〇五〇元新低價、較上週下跌二〇〇之巨、蓋日美情勢險惡、金價下　、中美交通恐成問題、故有此跌勢也、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖價步降</h3>
<p>昨糖市以外滙鬆長、合價較宜、公會劃盤鬆落愈甚、現貨二四粗白本棧七十七九半、小五角、外棧七十六元半、跌一元、轉口貨叫六十元半、亦小一元、尙乏成交、荷赤初降一元、為五十八元、後更降至五十七元半、及五十七元、前後跌去二元、路貨五十六元至五十六元四角、太古車白B嘜七十四元、降一元二角、　DY嘜七十二元、降度相同、HX嘜七十二元、降八角、趨勢仍軟、尙防續鬆、</p>
<h3>南北貨　府紅棗轉跌</h3>
<p>府紅棗見新後、因近到較多、價乃轉鬆、昨開盤較高之貨為四十元、以次照减、如各方銷胃活動、後市可望轉定、蓋現市較頭盤巳降四五元矣、</p>

<h3>美國務院發訓令　勸遠東僑民撤退　美對遠東政策益趨堅強　上海美僑靜待正式通知</h3>
<p>據昨日西人方面所得可靠消息、華盛頓國務院已訓令美國駐遠東各領事署、轉囑僑居中國境內（包括東北各地）與香港及越南之美僑、於最短時期內買棹返國、並悉美僑尤其為婦孺、已奉令必須迅速先行撤退、本埠華人方面、對於此一發展、認為或係美國參加歐戰之前奏、華人方面更稱、此項發展、非可等閒視之、蓋美孚油公司及德士古公司、僅三日前發出建議、勸令美籍職員之家屬從速返美、當時據稱大通銀行與花旗銀行職員、亦已接獲此項同樣建議、</p>
<p>正式通函卽可到滬</p>
<p>據悉、就美國人民之旅行與僑居而言、國務院已將遠東與歐洲等量齊觀、並悉今次之行動、為一種預防之步驟、並非基於遠東方面任何特殊之發展、但由於一般之穩定情形而起、現美孚·德士古·兩公司職員之家屬、所感困難者、為橫渡太平洋之旅行問題、眾料美國之商船、或將轉駛中國海協助美僑之撤退、正式勸告之通函、可望於此數日內寄達作華美僑、一般相信、亞洲艦隊職員之眷屬、目前僑居在華者、亦將同受此項新行動之影響、美僑方面稱、本埠美商行號之行動、將惟美孚與德士古兩公司之馬首是瞻、</p>
<p>美國已作事實答復</p>
<p>英文大美晚報昨載著名評論家伍德海之評論、略稱、美國對於此次歐戰向抱中立政策、雖在物質上盡量援助協約國、但迄今未遣一兵一卒赴歐海作戰、然美國之中立今後繼續與否、將視德意或日本所作之決定如何為斷、</p>
<p>美國不採犯罪政策</p>
<p>日首相近衛在其最近接見新聞記者時所發表之聲明、竟以美車如不承認軸心國家（日本亦在內）之要求、而不與日本積極合作建設「東亞新秩序」、則日本將「不惜一戰」等語、公然恫嚇美國、自美國之觀點而言、此種要求、不啻邀請美國共犯國際之重罪、實則美國不論何黨執政、決不採取此種與日本合作犯罪之政策、</p>
<p>舉國一致援助中國</p>
<p>自一九三七年中日戰事爆發以來、美國之遠東政策、向極堅決、而時至今日、美國政策、更甚於前、蓋羅斯福政府已公開援助自由之中國、卽羅氏之政敵（威爾基）亦公然主張盡力援助重慶政府、近衛之恫嚇、對於美國與情所產生之影響、誠如吾人之所預料也、</p>
<p>近衛恫嚇反應劇烈</p>
<p>美國今已明白表示、美政府決計對新執行之政策、決不容近衛或任何其他日本官吏破壞之、美國對於近衛之恫嚇、第一個反應卽為海軍後備員二萬七千人之被召入伍、海軍部長宣佈此項決定時、曾向其國警告謂、對軸心國家「試騐之時間」已近、則日本政府對於美國目下所處之地位、自當有所醒覺矣、</p>
<p>大部人類靜候拯救</p>
<p>歐洲之、獨裁者及遠東之黷武軍閥「已決意建設其「新秩序」、此種新秩序」、凡愛好自由之人民莫不反對之、在此「新秩序」之下、不知有數百萬被犧牲者、「新秩序」之實現、無異以絕望與悲苦加於大部份人類、試觀挪威·丹麥·荷蘭·比利時·波蘭·阿比西尼亞·以及法國與中國淪陷之人民、其在「新秩序」下所度之生活、尙有人生之樂趣可言乎此等人民、莫不忍辱偷生、希望正義者之拯救、而恢復其已失去之自由也、</p>

<h3>工部局糧委會主席發表　對於米市之意見　對各方非難有所解釋　認限制米介無補事實</h3>
<p>工部局糧食委員會主席馬歇爾氏、昨發表對於本埠米市之意見、首稱工部局各委員會、以主席名義、公開有所發表者、實不常見、但鑒於本會並非工部局之正常委員會、重以總董曁總辦兼總裁一再堅囑、爰為文發表意見如下、</p>
<p>屢與日方接洽疏通</p>
<p>茲首先應行聲明者、卽本人不願批評其他當道、因渠等遭受特殊之困難也、余所願發表者、僅限於本會所採取之政策及對於米市之意見而已、查工部局對於米市之措置、一以本會之建議為依歸、近來米價飛漲、外界以為局方並無適當措施、無法制止米價之高漲、頗加非難、更由於最近「市長」傅筱庵接見字林西報記者之談話中、若干人士之腦海中、恐留有一種影象、一若工部局非惟袖手旁觀、抑且不願與隣界各當道合作者然、用是不得不鄭重解釋、以正視聽、</p>
<p>工部局請求日本當道設法疏通國米來源者已非一次、目曾一再表示願與各有關係方面通力合作、以期國米運滬、通暢無阻、本年七月間、「市長」傳筱庵曾向工部局及法公董局建議、由三市政機關派員會同檢討本埠糧食問題、工部局對於上項建議、表示贊同、並於七月十六日派遺本人曁本會秘書等　人、前往市中心區出席會議、討論結果、決定組織一共同委員會、研究如何改善米市之辦法、並議決由傳「市長」召開第二次會議、旋於同月二十日、工部局　定本會委員梅洛君曁秘書皮斯萊君及本人為局方代表、同時法公董局亦會指派代表數人、但嗣後傳「市長」並未召集會議、</p>
<p>但望米市制止抬價</p>
<p>產地國米之運滬、遭受種種限制、不能暢運到滬、以致租界居民、不得不仰給於洋米之供給、本會認為如果限制洋米之售價、不得超過其成本外加合理之利潤、非特於事無補、為抑且有害、吾人必須認明事實、其無米可購、不如獲有高價之米糧、良以商人貿易、倘無利益可圖、勢必停止採購、本會希望能制止抬價、惟認為彈制售價低於其成本、則危險滋多、故寗願招致外界之抨擊、而不願向局方建議此種謬誤之步驟也、</p>
<p>本會對於若干人士囤積米糧、待價而沽、非不明瞭、然而國積米糧、不特有霉蝕之危險、抑且有因米價趨跌而遭蒙重大損失之虞、允以一旦內地弛禁、國米湧到之時為最、丁茲世界局勢擾攘、當務之急、　為儲倫充分米糧、以防航運一旦阻塞、任何粗率之定章、徒使洋米之訂購、停止進行、至於一般商人預儲存貨、吾人實無可反對者、　若輩必恃其存貨以源源應市也、</p>
<p>工部局旣無法統制國米之來源、又不能訂購大批洋米、運滬濟市、故處置米市、必須愼重將事、以免阻碍商人或私人之訂購洋米也、</p>
<h3>日軍犯陽澄湖失利　已向蘇州撤退</h3>

<h3>西區警權　迄未續商　交涉陷於停頓狀態</h3>
<p>據工部局發言人昨日對西報記者稱、關於越界築路區之警權問題、目下之談判情形、巳陷於靜止之狀態、工部局自接到警務處總巡包文少校所呈之意見書後、卽邀傳筱庵囑令盧英與警務處代表會議、以便討論此一問題、但傅筱庵迄今尙未佈置使盧英與警務處代表會議、以致雙方迄無機會接談、</p>
<h3>受傻孤軍　營中安定如恒</h3>
<p>據工部局發言人昨對記者稱、前日（七日）被擊受傷之孤軍營兵士丁國順、現在仁濟醫院、傷勢已有滿意之進步、該發言人稱、此事發生後、孤軍營中情形、一切均安靜、並無任何糾紛、該發言人對於其餘受傷之華人男女各一、傷勢如何、不知其詳、因彼等係由某方救護車所帶去也、惟據英文大美晚報消息謂、被流彈擊中之華籍平民兩人、僅受微傷、經包紮後、業巳出醫院、</p>
<h3>法商工潮談話　又吿停滯　又有二查票員被綁</h3>
<p>法商水電公司之電車公共汽車工潮　僵持迄今、巳達十三日、勞資雙方意見、時見接近、時忽阻梗、據昨日所得消息、七日下午談判、又吿破裂、資方除允加米貼五元五角及承認勞方代表外、對勞方新組工會、及增加工資六成、堅不接受、致未能獲得解決、昨日除勞方集議對策外、雙方未繼續談判、又悉咋日下午三時、該公司又有十八號查票黃元吉、（南翔人、住大沽路、）廿七號寫票路鴻君、（住金神父路打浦橋新新里、）在公司鐵門口被人綁去、查該公司查票及寫票被綁者、先後八人之多、迄今尙不明下落、又訊、廿二路公共汽車、仍在法租界開行據公司當局稱、如罷工繼續不解決、將增加電車公共汽車之車輛、僱用新工開駛、以利交通、法巡捕房仍繼續偵查被綁五工人、現仍毫無眉目、</p>

<p>正式消息</p>

<h3>加薪的一天</h3>
<p>— 白兮</p>
<p>當鐘面上的時針移近五點時，寫字間里呆坐了整天的人們開始活躍起來；算盤和打字機的單調而不動聽的合奏曲是停止了，代之而起的是嘈雜的談話聲和斷續的笑聲。</p>
<p>「老張，今天拿到了兩成外快，該去吃他一頓啦。」</p>
<p>「好，西菜呢還是中菜？」</p>
<p>「我看還是西菜，大家敲瓦爿，好嗎？」</p>
<p>「好的，趕着這大雨天，菜館裏沒生意，弄起小菜來一定特別道地，說不定還會格外多些呢。」</p>
<p>「老王，現在灌足了血，晚上又可以去跳一個通宵才夠味！</p>
<p>「你們說的都得花錢，只有我才有着一個有得吃有得玩又不用化錢的好法子，要是你們高興，可以跟我同去。」</p>
<p>「唔。不用說啦，你又要到老地方去了吧？自坐汽車白吃大菜誰說不開心呢？可是你得留心着，五十塊錢津貼還不够打兩下！」</p>
<p>「老錢，你做的花旗空頭補進了沒有？」</p>
<p>「不，還得看風頭呢！現在中美借款成立，消息利空，着實好做他一下呢！」</p>
<p>「匯票鬆下去，東西却漲起來，洋秈也漲到七十多塊錢一担了呢！唉，這兩成津貼做甚麼好呢？眞是良鄉栗子難過日子！」</p>
<p>「對呵，像大班間里老沈那樣才活得下去，人家這樣請求那樣請求，好容易求得洋人發善心，答應大家加薪兩成，可是大家拿到手的，總是那麼五塊六塊的，籠總不够買一斗米，老沈他不費點力氣，却一下子拿到了整整的七十隻老洋，實在有辦法！」</p>
<p>「你可知道洋人們自己這個月的薪水加了百分之五十呢？」</p>
<p>「世界上的事情原是這樣呵！公平根本是空話，有飯昤的人囤着白米養胖了耗子，眼看着窮人乾癢着肚子！」</p>
<p>當大家集在一堆談笑時，坐在寫字間角落裹的一個起碼職員，仍是不停地翻動着那笨重的帳簿，埋着頭在數字堆裹兜圈，他雖然沒作聲，可是人家的談話却包句傳入他的耳鼓，紊亂的思潮在他的腦海中湧起。剛才，當別人拿到了一担米錢的津貼的當兒，他也幸運地得到了只够買五升米的五塊錢，他想起了一家人忍受着飢餓時的愁顏，沉重地把這五塊錢接了過來，正像大旱逢甘霖一般，他想着今天可以售五升米，大家吃兩天粥了；可是又想到妻在病牀上呻吟巳十多天了，該給他看看醫生撮服藥吃……打斷他的思緒的是時鐘報五點的幾聲響，他抬起頭來向窗外望，暴風雨正疾捲着，像千軍萬馬在奔騰。</p>
<p>「誰要坐汽車，八角錢一位，團體客車十分舒服！」</p>
<p>他默默地在角落里脫下了鞋襪，將褲管捲得高高地，準備跟在潮暴雨去搏鬥！府</p>
<h3>小統計</h3>
<p>— 袁山</p>
<p>據報載上海難民救濟協會舞塲組勸寡委員會謝啟報吿：八月一日至三十日甲級舞廳募得七千七百十四元；按該數係一元寡捐一角，則其原數為七萬七千一百四十元。乙級舞廳募得一千八百六十三元二角五分；按該數係一元寡捐五分，則其原數為三萬七千二百六十五元。兩數相加，則為十一萬四千四百零五元；且此數僅以該報吿之念二個舞塲而言，合全滬舞塲所有收入，當不止此數。茲拾棄為此所消耗之精神與時間而不言，設卽單取該數以辦有益之事業，想必不難定有可觀之成績發見矣。</p>

<p>假使米再貴下去：上海有錢有糧的人們，它們的財物，不用在救濟事業方面，勢必要盡用在為它們保障安全的工作上面去了！</p>

<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第九章　驚人消息</p>
<p>余甘棠答道：「我雖祇瞧見他的背形，但決不會瞧錯。那時我就大起疑心，但因着那個女同學在旁邊，雨又下得很大，故而不便停車。我回到宿舍以後，越想越疑，實在再睡不熟，因此我重新從宿舍裏出來，到麗蘭家去，想瞧瞧究竟有沒有變故。我到伊家裹時，樓下的客室中沒有燈光，但餐室中電燈依舊亮着，金梅也在樓下沒有睡。我知道已出了岔子。我想走進去時，金梅恰從餐室中走出，瞧見了我，向我揮揮手。我就沒有進去。</p>
<p>霍桑暗暗點着頭，自言自語地說：「這個女子眞不容易應付。伊也許還握着這秘案的鑰匙。」他向我瞧瞧，我也略略點點頭，表示我對於這女僕，有同樣的懷疑。他又權續問道：「那時你可曾和金梅交談？」</p>
<p>那少年道：「沒有，伊祇在裹面向我揮手，我得了伊的暗號，覺得進去一定有什麽不方便，當然更沒有和伊交談的機會。我便又退回宿舍去，心中明知麗蘭一定出了什麽岔子，所以更不合眼。今天一淸早，我就趕到昌明里我的朋友宋兆麒家裹去，想跟他商量一下，再定進行的辦法。兆麒還沒有起身，等了好久，我才能開始和他密談。我把經過的情形，完全吿訴了他，他却勸我不要顧問這一件事。他料想道一件事也許會鬧大，我犯不着牽連進去。現在想想，他的忠吿的確很有意思。但當寺我袛覺得他不够朋友，不肯幫我的忙。我會和他辯論了好一回，終於沒有結果。我定意再要到麗蘭家去，他却竭力阻止我，又留我在他那裹進了早餐。我再三考慮，覺得無論如何，我不能袖手旁觀。所以我終於不聽兆麒的勸阻，我父到靑蒲路去。趕到伊家裏時，麗蘭的尸體，恰巧從門裹抬出來。我確曾冒險把單被揭閒了瞧瞧，才知麗蘭果眞被人打死——巳被趙伯雄打死。</p>
<p>余甘棠略略停頓了一下。他的眼睛裹父射出怒火的光燄，向霍桑凝視了一下又把目光移開去，好像以下的話又有些雖於出口。霍桑似已透視到他的心事，便代替他接續下去。霍桑道：「那時你旣巳認定趙伯雄打死了麗蘭，便決意為伊報仇；你重新去看宋兆麒，堅持地要向他借手槍：他仍不肯答應，竭力勸阻你，你竟像發瘋似地吵起來，非借不可；他沒有辦法，借給你一支沒有子彈的空手槍——」</p>

<p>— 游記者</p>
<p>梁紅玉的故事早經史册留傳，這位一代民族女英雄的事蹟，在此時此地搬上銀幕，我以為確留有極深長積極之含義的</p>
<p>「木蘭從軍」以後，上海電影界一度誤入民間故事影片的岐途，其中金星的「李香君」，自然能予觀衆有良好印象，現在，華襲的「梁紅玉」，也居然給我們一種新的感覺，以內容言，「梁紅玉」的遝材，不但較之前述兩張影片蓄意深切，卽以話劇「明末遺恨」「祖國」兩劇相論，亦覺十分親切直覺。</p>
<p>我們反對黃色電影羞辱自己的文化，但也一樣英勇地為着有積極內容的影片寄予熱烈的同情，像「梁紅玉」，它吿訴給觀衆—國家利益高於一切，她為了丈夫韓世忠的誤失戎機，放走非人，不能生擒元兇，於是，大義凜然，理智勝過戀情，單身奔返宋廷彈劾丈夫，請求治其應得之罪，雖然那是數百年前的事，但在今日的中華兒女，還是値得承繼和學習梁紅玉的精神，而使之發揚光大的。</p>
<p>像「梁紅玉」這類影片，我是樂為觀衆推薦的。</p>

<p>「女子公寓」這劇本差不多是盡人皆知的了。過去演出這戲的劇團也已不在少數。並且會經拍成電影，轟動一時。致遠劇社的演員們，本着他們學生所應有的認眞的和學習態度，再加上名導演的領導，一定可以攝取每個前車之鑒」的精粹，結晶出更高的藝術。我預祝致遠劇社任　十節國慶日得到藝術上的勝利！</p>

<h3>Britain Officially Notifies Japan: Reopening of the Burma Road on the 18th; Churchill Simultaneously Announces in the House of Commons: Anglo-Japanese Relations Will Undergo a Sharp Change</h3>
<p>London – Prime Minister Churchill, during his speech in the House of Commons today regarding the war situation, stated that upon the expiration of the current Anglo-Japanese agreement to blockade the Burma Road, the road will be reopened. He said, "Three months ago, we were asked to blockade this road because we sincerely wished to provide an opportunity for the Chinese and Japanese governments to reach a fair resolution to their long-standing dispute. Therefore, we agreed. Unfortunately, such a resolution has not been achieved, and the prolonged war of conquest by the Japanese against the Chinese nation continues unabated. Although we deeply regret the missed opportunity, the British government, under all circumstances, insists on maintaining the agreement until October 17th. However, beyond this date, we see no reason for its continuation." He also stated that Japan's recent accession to the Tripartite Pact seems quite unfavorable to Japan. He wondered if there might be some secret clauses. It is difficult to understand how Germany and Italy will assist Japan. This pact is directly aimed at the United States, and secondarily at the Soviet Union, but Britain and the United States never yield to threats. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Today, Britain formally notified Japan that it has decided to reopen the Burma Road on October 18th. The Foreign Ministry announced at 5 PM that British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie, acting on instructions from his government, paid a special visit to Foreign Minister Matsuoka. It is said that the British government sees no reason why it should not reopen the Burma Road after the expiration of the Anglo-Japanese agreement on the blockade of the Burma Road. Regarding this point, all parties believe that Anglo-Japanese relations will undergo a rapid change. Since Japan has already signed the Tripartite Alliance and declared its determination to suppress countries aiding China, Britain's reopening of this important trade route to China will inevitably be seen as a hostile act towards Japan. It is also expressed here that the reopening of the Burma Road will also worsen Japanese-American relations. The Japanese believe that Britain's attitude is provoking America, and the U.S. cannot escape its responsibility. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – According to a statement released by the Foreign Ministry, British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie met with Foreign Minister Matsuoka this morning to inform him that Britain would not continue the agreement to blockade the Burma Road. The statement was very brief, and officials declined to comment, but a formal protest is expected. It is noted that last week, Japanese newspapers strongly hinted at the possibility of Japanese aircraft bombing the Burma Road from bases in Vietnam. The Japanese all believe that Britain's notice to reopen the Burma Road will not affect Britain's ban on military and other supplies from passing through Hong Kong to China. The Japan Times believes that Britain's decision to reopen the only remaining artery for supplies to Chongqing is intended to save face before the Chinese and to assist Chongqing as a force to resist Japan jointly with the United States. It is generally expected that Japan's reasons for protesting Britain's decision will be that it violates the spirit of the three-month blockade agreement between the two countries, as its content contained a tacit understanding regarding the possibility of extending the blockade. Japan may further consider this move to be a violation of the letter and spirit of the Arita-Craigie Agreement of last year, according to which Britain recognized Japan's special position and needs in China and declared no intention of assisting Japan's enemies. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>British Ambassador Visits Soviet Foreign Minister to Review the Entire Far Eastern Situation</p>
<p>London – Reuters learned last night that British Prime Minister Churchill will deliver a speech on the Burma Road issue in the coming days. The Anglo-Japanese agreement, which expires on October 17th, stipulates that during the effective period of this agreement, efforts should be made to achieve a general resolution to the Far Eastern question. Now that Japan is not moving in this direction but is advancing into Vietnam in an attempt to attack China from the side, and has formed a Tripartite Alliance against Britain,</p>
<h3>U.S. Intensifies Economic Sanctions Against Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo – According to the "Nichi Nichi Shimbun," after the United States bans the import of copper, steel, coal, oil, and other items to Japan, it will ban the import of Japanese raw silk to the United States. However, Japanese-American relations will not necessarily break down because of this. This measure only constitutes one element in the various factors leading to a severance of Japanese-American relations. The newspaper hopes that India and Australia will join the Far Eastern economic bloc. (Haitong News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>New York – Starting today, voters in all cities in the United States (except those with a population of less than 5,000) will begin the registration process. (Haitong News Agency, 8th)the British government, while studying the path that Britain should take after the expiration of the existing agreement, has been in close contact with the United States. It is generally recognized that most of the German-Italian-Japanese alliance is aimed at the United States. The rumor that the Japanese side requested an extension of the agreement period has not been confirmed. Tokyo has recently issued statements believing that it is possible for the Japanese army to conduct military operations from Vietnam, and the Burma Road is within the bombing range, so this road cannot be used. It is therefore suspicious that British Prime Minister Churchill will announce the opening of the Burma Road when the agreement expires. Since the policies of Britain and the United States toward the Far East are the same, and the governments of the two countries are constantly exchanging views, it can now be concluded that Britain has notified the United States of its opinion on reopening the Burma Road. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>London – It was announced here last night that British Ambassador to Moscow Sir Stafford Cripps held a lengthy discussion with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on Friday night of last week. It is believed that the British Ambassador expressed to the Soviet Foreign Minister that the British government has decided to reopen the Yunnan-Burma Road on October 17th. It is also speculated that these diplomats will also review the entire Far Eastern situation after Japan joined the Tripartite Alliance. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<p>London – Japanese Ambassador to Britain Mamoru Shigemitsu had a long conversation with British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Rab Butler yesterday. This was Mamoru Shigemitsu's first visit to the British Foreign Office since Japan signed the Tripartite Alliance Treaty. It is generally understood that the matters discussed between the two did not go beyond the scope of the Tripartite Alliance and Anglo-Japanese relations. It is believed that Rab Butler informed the Japanese Ambassador of Britain's decision to reopen the Yunnan-Burma Road, but the formal official notification will be delivered to the Japanese government by British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt to Announce U.S. Foreign Policy on the Weekend; British Ambassador Has Long Talk with U.S. Secretary of State; Plans for Cooperation Between the Two Countries in the Far East Determined</h3>
<p>Washington – British Ambassador to the United States Lord Lothian had a lengthy conversation with Secretary of State Hull here yesterday to discuss the problems of Britain and the United States in the Far East. After the meeting, the British Ambassador told reporters that he and Mr. Hull had "fully exchanged information on the world situation," but he declined to disclose the content of the discussion. Some observers believe that yesterday's meeting was to make the final decision on the plan for cooperation between Britain and the United States in the Far East. This plan may be announced this week by President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill. President Roosevelt will issue an important statement on American foreign policy this Saturday, and Prime Minister Churchill is also preparing to speak to the House of Commons this week. The British Ambassador told reporters yesterday that he has not yet received official notification of Britain's decision to reopen the Yunnan-Burma Road in order to transport war materials to the Chongqing government.

Shortly thereafter, Under Secretary of State Welles received French Ambassador Henry-Haye, while Secretary of the Navy Knox visited U.S. Naval Commander-in-Chief Richardson, reportedly to discuss "routine naval events," but these events are of course related to the Pacific.

At the same time, it was heard from official sources that the Axis powers will immediately take new actions in the Far East, but what kind of actions they are is still unclear.

<p>Tokyo – The Asahi Shimbun published an editorial today stating that since Japan announced the New Order in East Asia, Britain and the United States have maintained strong opposition, which is well known to everyone. We naturally do not want to cause unnecessary conflicts, but it is also certain that our process will never succeed because of this opposition. The Tripartite Alliance is indeed what we urgently need. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Japanese newspapers today reiterated Japan's determination to "disregard" British and American "interference" in the Far East and to promote Japan's "Greater East Asia New Order" plan, regardless of the consequences. The Asahi Shimbun expressed its approval of Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka's speech here yesterday. The Foreign Minister said, "Japan will never let the obstacles of Britain and the United States defeat our purpose." The newspaper said, "What we can do is only to move forward purposefully and never allow anyone to stop us." The newspaper also said that after Japan expressed its intention to establish a "New Order in East Asia," Britain immediately decided on its actions based on its "deep-rooted theory of maintaining the status quo." The newspaper continued, "Why the work of coexistence and co-prosperity that Japan is carrying out in this region is so strongly opposed by Britain and the United States is really puzzling."

<h3>U.S.-Soviet Talks Continue: Discussing Improving Relations Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>Washington – The talks between U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles and Soviet Ambassador to the United States Oumansky, which began in August, suddenly continued last night, arousing a new speculation that the Soviet Union may not approve of the German-Italian-Japanese alliance. These talks began two months ago, and Welles had discussed reforming Soviet-American relations with the Soviet Ambassador several times, but then stopped. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Reviewing the Attitude of the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>The international situation has developed to its current stage. The conflict will inevitably erupt into a world war. But observing the situation on all sides, although the tensions are close to the extreme, a world war is not imminent at the moment. This is because the actual preparations and arrangements of various countries have not yet been completed; and the evolution of the Soviet Union from its current attitude to a clear state cannot be expected too hastily. The Soviet Union is extremely cautious, and the countries are taking the Soviet Union as the core of their pursuit: probably the day the pursuit becomes clear will be the time when the war begins!</p>
<p>No one can predict what attitude the Soviet Union will take until the eve of the start of the war, but we might as well review from the beginning and analyze from the side to try to understand the truth. It is not necessary to say it too far. From the conclusion of the so-called Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany and Japan in November 1926, one year later to the participation of Italy in the agreement in November of the following year: in the past three or four years, the Soviet Union's diplomatic dealings with these three countries can be said to be step by step success. Originally, after Stalin took over, the Soviet Union devoted itself wholeheartedly to domestic construction, and what he urgently needed was peace. Germany, Italy, and Japan were awed and concluded an anti-communist pact, intending to cooperate with each other and prevent the destructive work of the Third International; that is, the Soviet Union's activities in the international arena, while winning the sympathy of anti-Soviet elements in Britain and the United States, to cover up its growing military aggression. The Soviet Union saw through this point, and in order to protect its own existence, it could not be excluded from the international stage, and waited for the anti-Soviet front to become strong and consolidated. It could not sit and wait for the final offensive; therefore, it also became active in various ways diplomatically. Over the past three or four years, the Soviet Union has actively developed its functions under various slogans such as "peace diplomacy," "collective security," "aid to just wars," and "opposition to imperialist wars," and has passively avoided crises in its foreign relations. Until today, its gains are: (1) The Soviet Union has still not been dragged into the wars in Asia and Europe. (2) Its own strong material foundation has been laid firmly and consolidated. (3) It has established a sincere and trustworthy friendly foundation with China in the East and Turkey in the South; moreover, it has built a strong outer line on its border, from the Arctic Ocean all the way to the Black Sea. (4) From an isolated and dangerous situation, it has, through the years, and through several transformations, reached a position of importance, becoming the target of pursuit by all parties. These four points alone, even those who deeply hate it, cannot help but admire its success! How did it achieve this success? It can (1) take advantage of the contradictions between "having" colonial countries and "not having" colonial countries. (2) Play up the contradictions between aggressors and small and weak countries. (3) Especially important is to grasp the contradictions "having" colonial powers and "not having" colonial powers. In simple terms, the victory of Soviet diplomacy over the past three or four years has been completely entrusted to the multifaceted complexity of the entire international relationship in space, and the staggered circumstances in time.</p>
<p>At this stage, Germany, Italy, and Japan have formally announced their alliance. At least in the next few years (not necessarily ten), the three countries will inevitably advance and retreat together, simplifying an important link in the complexity of the international situation. The Soviet Union's actions and policies toward these three countries will be forced to gradually converge; there will eventually be a time when it will not be a full friend or an enemy to the three countries. Following behind the three countries, joining the group, and becoming one of the partners in the spoils; helping them create a rural environment that fundamentally violates the basic principles of one's own founding, but isolating oneself in the extreme right-wing fire, eventually turning against each other and becoming the final fate. What is comprehensive "neutrality"? If the three countries gradually gain power, they will inevitably demand that the Soviet Union stop aiding China, sever friendly relations with Turkey, and cut off the connection between the United States and the Soviet Union. At that time, if the Soviet Union takes temporary security as a good plan and still touts "neutrality," then the day it accepts the demands will immediately be tantamount to willingly withdrawing from the international stage, and then sitting and waiting for others to determine the outcome and then bowing down to accept the judgment against oneself.</p>
<p>The above two paths are by no means an overestimation, nor a dangerous statement. There is indeed rich potential in between. Some say that the Soviet Union is not only extremely cautious but also extremely smart. He has superhuman foresight and ingenious calculations: for example, now it may be possible to promote the infighting of the capitalist world from the side, and at the appropriate time, easily reap greater benefits; is this not the best strategy? Why bother to distinguish between friends and enemies now? The key lies in the strength of the Soviet Union in the front? Transcending national boundaries, the comments of social war its rights or wrongs. But, when a country has launched or is facing a national war, social war is eliminated by national consciousness: Therefore, the possibility of world revolution is smaller than the possibility of a world war. This will at least be the case for the next decade or two. In small terms, the Soviet-Finnish War last year can be a good example. The Soviet Union has long discovered this theory, that revolution is not something that can be transplanted; it is impossible for a country to have a revolution by external force alone, let alone make the whole world! It can be seen that taking over and making plans for the Soviet Union is absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>If the previous argument is not wrong, then the future between the Soviet Union and Germany, Italy, and Japan must conclude with complete hostility. On the fundamental direction of hostility, will the Soviet Union join hands with Britain and the United States, or partially join hands? Join hands immediately, or join hands in the future? This is the only remaining fork in the road at the moment!</p>

<p>Hanoi – Japanese military authorities here stated last night that Japan may soon find it necessary to request an increase in the scope of use of Vietnamese airports, and Japanese officials also stated that Japanese troops in Vietnam will request credit loans from Vietnam to maintain the Japanese garrison there. Regarding these two points, the French authorities believe that Japan has already violated the Franco-Japanese agreement, and Japan's intentions will naturally be put into action. At present, the Japanese army in Vietnam has already concentrated 40 aircraft at the Gia Lam airfield and stationed 60 mechanical infantrymen there as local garrison troops. From here to Haiphong, electric wires have been installed to strengthen communications. The French authorities pointed out that Japan has actually controlled the entire Tonkin region. In addition, the French side has denied reports that Thai troops have crossed the Vietnamese border. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>

<p>Vichy – The Secretary-General of the French Foreign Ministry yesterday explained to this agency's Vichy correspondent the relationship between France and Thailand, saying that the French government has notified Thailand's representative in Paris that the Mekong River is the natural border between Thailand and Vietnam, and what should be negotiated is about the northern part of the Mekong River. France has expressed its willingness to cede some very fertile islands to Thailand, although France is still willing to sign a non-aggression treaty with Thailand due to the tensions between the two countries. The request to cede the lower Mekong River and Cambodian provinces is unacceptable to France. (Haitong News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>Vichy – A semi-official document declared that the Vichy government rejected Thailand's new demands earlier this month, including the cession of all British territory on the right bank of the Mekong River, and guaranteed that if French sovereignty over the two protectorates of Laos and Cambodia were to be transferred to a third country, the two territories would be ceded to Thailand. Previously, Thailand only requested the transfer of some Mekong River islands. The Vichy government had agreed to Thailand's request to organize a mixed commission to investigate the case of a Thai man being shot and killed by French military police on the border. The French side claimed that the victim was Vietnamese. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

Small boats will pass first, and the construction project is easier than the Kra Isthmus. The two rivers are only 20 kilometers apart in several places, and the difference in their water levels can be adjusted with several locks. It is said that preparatory work is already underway.

<h3>U.S. Advises Far East Nationals to Withdraw, Saying It Is a Precautionary Measure; Most U.S. Nationals in Japan Voluntarily Leaving; China Believes the U.S. and Japan Will Eventually Clash</h3>
<p>Washington. Today, the official announcement stated that the U.S. Department of State has instructed all U.S. consulates in the Far East to notify all U.S. nationals in China, Japan, "Manchukuo," Hong Kong, and Vietnam to return home as soon as possible. The Department of State confirmed that all American men, women, and children, if they do not have necessary and urgent business, will be advised to leave the Far East. It is reported that U.S. consulates in the Far East will issue this notice in the middle of this week. This action by the U.S. Department of State is purely a precautionary plan and is not due to any special situation. It is also reported that the U.S. Asiatic Fleet will also instruct the families of all naval officers to return to the U.S. as soon as possible. (Associated Press telegram from the 8th)</p>
<p>Tokyo. According to investigations, U.S. nationals in Japan have not yet been notified by the U.S. authorities to withdraw, but most Americans have already left Japan voluntarily or are preparing to return to the U.S. (Associated Press telegram from the 8th)</p>
<p>Manila. U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, recently commented on the U.S. State Department's order to U.S. consulates in China, Japan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, etc., to notify Americans to evacuate the Far East, saying that this should not be regarded as an indication of serious difficulties to come. This is merely a precautionary measure to avoid unnecessary difficulties for Americans in the event of an accident. (Associated Press telegram from the 8th)</p>
<p>Chongqing. People here recently believe that the U.S. State Department's decision to evacuate U.S. nationals in the Far East is the prelude to a future war between Japan and the U.S. Well-informed sources said that tensions between the U.S. and Japan have reached a point where any unfortunate event could happen at any time. The news that U.S. consulates in various parts of China will soon notify U.S. nationals to evacuate has attracted much attention here. (Associated Press telegram from the 8th)</p>
<p>Chongqing. Observers here believe that the U.S. and Japan will inevitably clash, and it is only a matter of time, either after the November general election or next spring. It is generally believed that the outcome of the U.S. presidential election may not have any impact on developments in the Far East, because American public opinion is united on foreign policy, regardless of whether the ruling party is Republican or Democratic. General public opinion here believes that international developments are now gradually favoring China. The U.S. is superior to Japan in terms of resources, as well as naval and air force strength. If Japan and the U.S. go to war, the resolution will be very rapid. The outcome can be decided by only a few naval battles in the Pacific. The editorial of the Central Daily News pointed out that the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan is an alliance of aggression, whose main purpose is to destroy British interests in China. The newspaper said that one of the most important reasons for the alliance is that Germany and Japan want to create shocking moves to divert the attention of their people and cover up their failure to attack Britain and their unfavorable war against China. As for the third clause of the alliance, the countries outside the war that can influence the outcome of the war are the U.S. and the Soviet Union. (Judging from its text, it is aimed at the United States, and judging from its intention, it is also to prevent the Soviet Union from participating in the war on the side of the Allied countries, in order to concentrate its efforts to deal with China, Britain, and the United States. Germany, Italy, and Japan are now trying to appease the Soviet Union. Their first task is to prevent the United States from participating in the war, and the second is to prevent the Soviet Union from assisting China and Britain.) According to predictions by observers here, the reopening of the Burma Road on October 17 will be the starting point for the rapid and decisive development of the Far East situation. Japan will definitely exert maximum pressure on British and American land and interests in the Far East, or may take action against Tianjin, Shanghai, and Hong Kong. At the same time, Japan will also use the settlement of Vietnam and Luoluo to attack Burma, in order to block the passage of supplies to China, and to spy on Singapore, the most important naval port in the Far East. At that time, Chinese troops may be transferred to Burma to help Britain defend, and the U.S. fleet will definitely impose sanctions on Japan to ensure the safety of Singapore.

<h3>Manila Stock Prices Fall; U.S. Withdrawal of Nationals from the Far East Has Made a Deep Impression</h3>
<p>Manila. This afternoon, the news that the U.S. authorities will advise American nationals in Japan, China, Hong Kong, Manchuria, Korea, etc., to return home has already made a deep impression. The stock market fell sharply at closing, reaching as much as half. The families of naval and military personnel are all discussing this with each other. However, spokespersons from both the navy and the army said that the families of U.S. troops here may not have to evacuate immediately, but those living in China are very likely. Also, most of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet is currently anchored here. (Associated Press telegram from the 8th)</p>
<h3>Various Chinese Agencies in Hong Kong Stop Withdrawing to the Philippines</h3>
<p>Hong Kong. Some Chinese government agencies, banks, and other enterprises here had planned to withdraw to Manila, but since the establishment of the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, Manila is no longer considered a safer place than Hong Kong or Singapore. Therefore, the original plan has been abandoned by the Tripartite Pact. When the Japanese army occupied Shenzhen twice last August and this July, threatening Hong Kong, the Chinese side considered the Philippines to be a safe place in the East. Some Chinese government agencies have already established branches in Manila. If it were not for the Axis powers, they would have all moved there long ago. Chinese opinion here is that the new alliance treaty is fundamentally and directly aimed at the United States. Therefore, if war breaks out in the Pacific, the Philippines will be in a dangerous situation. It is generally believed that Hong Kong's land defenses are stronger than those of the Philippines, and aggressors will have to pay a higher price to attack. It is possible that part of the U.S. fleet in Hawaii may be dispatched to the Philippines. However, at that time, war in the Philippines is more likely to break out, and the place will not be a haven for Chinese capital and business. Chinese capital had previously flowed into the Philippines, but now Filipinos are not very enthusiastic about welcoming Chinese capital because of the development of Chinese businesses. At the same time, with the establishment of a new alliance of totalitarian states, the inflow of Chinese capital into the Philippines has now stopped.

<h3>German Planes Again Launch Massive Attacks on Britain Yesterday; 13 Districts of London Are Badly Bombed; German Air Force Changes Strategy and Engages in Extensive Activities; British Air Force Raids Berlin for Four Hours</h3>
<p>London. Last night, London was subjected to extremely heavy bombing again. Although the momentum of the attack subsided slightly after midnight, last night's air raid was the most intense since the start of the war. Yesterday, at least 13 areas in the city of London and at least several areas in the outskirts of London were bombed. A large department store in London was hit by a "Molotov breadbasket" containing countless bombs and suffered very severe damage. Last night, as the German raiders approached London, British fighter planes were patrolling the skies around London. However, the German planes immediately dispersed and flew all over the sky over the outskirts. Some of the raiders managed to break through into the city and drop bombs in many places. According to British military officers, the anti-aircraft fire fired by British artillery at that time was the most intense since the war. Countless searchlights were also heavily active, illuminating German planes over the city center from afar. British fighter planes were fighting with newly arrived squadrons of German planes in the skies over the outskirts. At the same time, bombs fell in a certain area in southeastern Scotland, a certain town in Scotland, and various towns behind the northeastern coast, and a certain inland area. The German planes bombing these places hovered in the sky for a long time without fear of fierce anti-aircraft fire. Last night's aerial activity in London was most intense in the hours before the German planes launched their attack. However, after midnight, the momentum of the raiders suddenly decreased. After 1:00 AM, only occasional sounds of German planes flying could be heard. The German planes first launched a blitz air war against Britain on September 7. Therefore, yesterday's frenzy was exactly the first day after the one-month anniversary of the blitz air war. According to an announcement by the Air Ministry at 8:00 PM yesterday, 27 German planes had been shot down over England yesterday, while the British lost 13 planes. Six of the airmen were safe. Shortly after the air raid sirens sounded last night, two large high-explosive bombs fell in the area around a certain famous intersection in London. Although houses were bombed and collapsed, no one was injured. Traffic was also not obstructed by the piles of debris. At 8:00 PM, another residential area was hit by four bombs. The four bombs made a sharp, strange noise when they landed, as if they were dropped by a single German plane outside the range of British searchlights. At 7:55 PM, many incendiary bombs fell in a certain area in central London, but the fire caused by the bombs was brought under control within minutes. German planes concentrated over central London at one time, flying very high and beyond the reach of searchlights. These German planes flew in from all directions and arrived in central London in groups of three or five, then released large quantities of lethal and destructive straight-drop bombs. There were some casualties in yesterday's daylight air raid. At that time, a bomb fell almost directly into a public air-raid shelter in a certain town in the west. Various residential areas of London were also bombed during the daylight air raid. According to a joint communique from the Air Ministry and the Department of Internal Security yesterday evening, German planes attempted to raid London five times yesterday, with a total of 450 planes participating. Large squadrons of British fighter planes fought with the scattered enemy planes. German planes broke into London twice, but dropped very few bombs. According to reports as of 5:00 PM, several houses in the eastern and southern parts of London have been destroyed. Although several people were bombed to death, the casualties did not seem to be very heavy. There was also some minor damage and casualties in several towns and cities in Eastbourne, Dover, and Canterbury. This afternoon, southwestern England was attacked twice. According to British newspapers, a single German plane machine-gunned the streets of Eastbourne during the scattered air raid by German planes yesterday, flying very low when it carried out the attack, but no one was injured. Several of the German planes were fighter planes, each carrying one bomb. After dropping their bombs, these planes, which combined fighting and bombing, released their speed and demonstrated their fighter plane capabilities. (Associated Press telegram from the 8th)</p>
<p>Berlin. From Monday night to Tuesday morning, British bombers broke through strong anti-aircraft fire, causing German warehouses and railway buildings to suffer terrible air strikes. Although dozens of cannons on the ground in Berlin fired simultaneously, shaking with sound, the British planes still crossed the thick fire net and rushed into the skies over Berlin, making the German capital the longest attack since the start of the war, causing fires in several areas of the vast area. The British plane squadrons flew swiftly over Berlin around midnight and began dropping incendiary bombs and exploding bombs. The British planes moved nimbly, so the German defense aircraft failed to drive them away. The all-clear was not sounded until four hours and forty-three minutes later.

<h3>Axis Powers Attempt to Encircle Britain in a Pincer Movement; German Influence Gradually Extends Towards the Black Sea; Soviet Interests Are at Stake and Cannot Be Ignored</h3>
<p>Berlin. It was announced here today that large squadrons of German troops have entered Romania. According to semi-official opinions here, because German mechanized units and large numbers of infantry are moving in southeastern Europe, and Italian troops are relying on Egypt to advance towards the Suez Canal, it seems that large-scale military operations in the Mediterranean region are imminent. Military observers here predict that the cooperation of German and Italian troops on various fronts is intended to launch a huge pincer offensive to squeeze the British, squeezing them out of Gibraltar, starting from the Mediterranean Sea and the Dardanelles Strait. It is alleged that Germany is actually gradually controlling the Romanian army to prevent "any accidents" in the Black Sea region. (International News Agency telegram from the 8th)</p>
<p>New York. According to wireless reports, responsible parties in Berlin admitted that German troops are currently en route to Romania, and said that the dispatch of German troops is in accordance with the guarantee terms given by Germany to Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu. (Reuters telegram from the 8th)</p>
<p>Bucharest. More German troops entered Romania by plane yesterday. So far, there are about 15,000 German troops in Romania. According to unconfirmed reports last night, two more German divisions, about 30,000 men, will be dispatched to this place within this week. It is reported that the Romanian government has allowed German troops to enter the country to protect the oil-producing areas and reorganize the Romanian army. (Associated Press telegram from the 8th)</p>
<p>London. A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that although rumors of German troops entering Romania have not been confirmed by the relevant parties, London believes that they are not unfounded. Well-informed sources believe that this move by the German side is a very serious development in the overall situation in the Balkan Peninsula. All countries in the Balkan Peninsula and countries with some relationship to the region are significantly affected. The German side's claim that it needs to send two or three divisions of troops to protect the oil fields to prevent sabotage is too naive to deceive people. The entry of German troops into Romania is actually the starting point for the German side to occupy Romania and tighten control over the lower reaches of the Danube River. From this, it can be seen that the German side does not have much confidence in the Iron Guard's ability to control the overall situation. It is also noteworthy that this move by the German side is the first consequence of the Brenner Pass Conference. What is most concerning in the current situation is the reaction of the Soviet Union. Moscow may not take any obvious action or criticism to express its emotions. However, nothing is more contrary to the wishes of the Soviet Union than seeing Germany establish a foothold in the Black Sea. The natural consequence of the German side's occupation of Romania will have a significant impact on the countries of the Near East, or will eventually cause the urgent problem of the Dardanelles Strait. Bulgaria is now in danger of being immediately subjected to pressure from the German side, which is also not welcome by the Soviet Union. Since the German side has taken action, it is not surprising that the Italian side will follow suit and take parallel actions. If so, it would prove the saying that the Brenner Conference agreed on a plan to deal with the Balkan Peninsula. (Reuters telegram from the 8th)</p>

<p>London. The Italian side announced yesterday that Italian midget torpedo boats had sunk an enemy submarine, but at the same time admitted that Kalaabat was bombed by British planes, causing some casualties among the natives. Orton Luo, Massawa, and Medenma were also raided by British planes, killing three and injuring two natives, and causing damage to houses. A British submarine near Savona surfaced and fired shells at the city of Savona. (Reuters telegram from the 8th)</p>

<p>Britain Pays Attention to Developments in Romania</p>
<p>London. The British Foreign Office took a firm stance today on the dispute with Romania caused by the arrest of five Britons. Diplomatic circles are closely watching the development of the situation in Romania. Well-informed sources believe that the entry of German troops into Romania is a new offensive launched by the Axis powers against Turkey, whose ultimate goal is to obtain the rich oil fields of Iraq and Iran. It is said that all sectors of the Soviet Union are quite disturbed by the recent changes in the situation. (International News Agency telegram from the 8th)</p>
<h3>Germany and Italy to Send Special Envoys to Visit Spain</h3>
<p>Madrid – According to information obtained from responsible authorities in Berlin by our agency, two important representatives of the Axis powers will travel to Madrid in the coming days. The two representatives are Heinrich Himmler, the German Police Chief and Commander of the Sturmabteilung (SA), who will serve as a special envoy of the German Nazi Party to Spain, and Bono, who will serve as the special envoy of the King of Italy. (Haitong Telegraph, 8th)</p>
<p>Madrid – The leader of the Falange party in Madrid, Rivera, stated that all Spanish citizens and members of the Falange party should be satisfied with Interior Minister Sunar's visit to Germany and Italy on behalf of General Franco. Spain has now expressed its wishes, and Germany and Italy have understood our purpose and expressed their importance. Newspapers in Germany and Italy have also solemnly pointed out that Spain is also an important part of building a new Europe. The close relationship between Germany, Italy, and Spain will become even more apparent. (Haitong Telegraph, 8th)</p>
<h3>German and Soviet Ambassadors to Turkey Hold Long Talks</h3>
<p>Ankara – The first meeting between the new Soviet Ambassador to Turkey, Vinogradov, and the German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, since Vinogradov arrived in Ankara, has attracted great attention from diplomatic circles in Ankara. Vinogradov had not met with any other foreign diplomats in Turkey since his arrival. Political figures here say that the lengthy meeting between Vinogradov and von Papen demonstrates the friendly attitude between Germany and the Soviet Union and proves that the claim that the former Soviet Ambassador to Turkey, Terentyev, was recalled because he was too close to the German Ambassador, is completely unfounded.

<h3>America Invents a Powerful Weapon for Air Combat – New Type of Dive Bomber – Unparalleled Speed and Dense Armament – Maximum Range of 1,800 Miles</h3>
<p>New York – The Republic Aircraft Factory on Long Island, USA, is currently manufacturing a new type of dive bomber. When diving towards the ground at a speed of 370 miles per hour, it can drop three-quarters of a ton of high-explosive bombs. According to factory officials, the aircraft's speed and dense armament are unparalleled, and it can rotate in all directions for combat on both sides. The aircraft carries three-quarters of a ton of bombs, including one 750-pound bomb and six 100-pound small bombs. The aircraft is equipped with a special bomb-dropping mechanism that prevents the bombs from touching the propeller. The nose is equipped with two 30mm rapid-fire machine guns, whose bullets can pass through the gaps in the propeller. The tail is equipped with one 30mm flexible machine gun. The aircraft's armament potential is not limited to this; two rapid-fire machine guns can also be installed inside the wings, and there is room on the wings to install 30mm machine guns for strafing enemy troops during dives. After dropping all the bombs, the aircraft can intercept enemy fighter planes. The aircraft is made entirely of metal and is equipped with a 1,000-horsepower or more duplex Wasp engine. Its maximum range is 1,800 miles. It can be said to be a long range for a single-engine aircraft. After the bombs are dropped, its rate of climb reaches 3,000 feet per minute, and its maximum altitude is 30,000 feet. (International News Agency Telegraph, 8th)</p>
<h3>Germany and Italy Lure Bulgaria to Join the Axis Front – Macedonian Nationalists Call for Independence – Greece Opposes the Dismemberment of Territory</h3>
<p>Budapest – Diplomatic circles in Sofia are circulating rumors that Bulgaria will join the German-Italian-Japanese alliance. The news of German troops entering Romania was followed shortly by Bulgaria's entry into the Axis powers. This move indicates that Greece will be divided sooner, or that Yugoslavia may lose its territory. It is expected that Italy will invite representatives from the governments of Greece, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia to Rome to peacefully resolve the territorial demands of Bulgaria and Albania. Bulgaria is demanding an outlet through Thrace to the Aegean Sea, while Albania is demanding the northwestern part of Greece. At the same time, Macedonian nationalists are calling for independence or demanding that the Macedonian people merge with Bulgaria. If this happens, a small part of Yugoslavia will be annexed. It is rumored that Greece is still firmly opposed to any territorial concessions. Albania has concentrated 150,000 troops on its border. It is generally expected that Greece will succumb to the military force of the Axis powers and the pressure from Bulgaria. (International Telegraph, 8th)</p>

<h3>A Brief History of the Construction of the German Air Force</h3>
<p>Although the German Air Force does not have a long history, its organization, changes, progress, and the main figures in charge of its construction are all worthy of attention. The following is a translation of the records from the New York Times and Time magazine: 1. The importance of the German Air Force in this war cannot be overestimated, but it has clearly leapt from an auxiliary position to become the main weapon for today's independent attack on Britain. Five years ago, Hitler tasked Goering with building the Air Force. Goering was originally an aviation veteran in the last European war, serving as the commander of the famous "Richthofen" squadron. He nurtured and promoted it with the greatest effort, and finally created today's unparalleled air combat weapon. The initial and only goal of the German Air Force was to attack the enemy, to destroy all transportation, supplies, and production centers in the enemy's rear in one fell swoop, so that when the army advanced, it could achieve the effect of a sweeping wind.</p>
<p>The German Air Force no longer needs to cooperate with the army and can complete its independent tasks. Today's large-scale German attack on Britain is a demonstration of this style. There is not a single German soldier on British soil, but the German Air Force is disregarding everything and launching a decisive attack. Whether it is possible to determine the military victory or defeat of the two countries by relying solely on the Air Force is still unknown. However, according to the opinions of German military observers, the continuous bombing of Britain can shake the enemy's resistance before the army lands.</p>
<p>In order to create its independent combat position, the German Air Force adopted a self-sufficient method in its organization. All the necessary equipment for air force operations should be available. The German Air Force has its own communications team, its own medical equipment, and even "Air Force infantry," who use parachutes to carry out combat in the enemy's rear, holding strongholds until the main force arrives. These are all unique features of the German Air Force.</p>
<p>The German Air Force's achievement of its current position should be attributed to Goering and others. The brewing began ten years ago, but the actual training of personnel or the manufacture of machinery began in 1935. Therefore, the history of the construction of the German Air Force is only five years. The person in charge was Goering, and his confidant Milch. Goering was the designer, Hitler was the supporter, and Milch was the implementer and organizer, so his contribution was also great.</p>
<p>Goering and Milch met at the beginning of the Nazi Party's organization. Goering served in Baron Richthofen's famous air squadron in the last war. Milch was initially an artillery officer and later became the president of the state-owned airline. He is short in stature and full of energy. Judging from his appearance, he has the air of a shrewd and capable American businessman. In the early days of its creation, it was difficult and painstaking. Germany was originally a poor country, and was bound by the Treaty of Versailles at the time, and could not establish an air force. In 1933, the Nazi Party came to power, and Aviation Minister Goering appointed Milch as the Director of Air Transportation. Milch ordered the brave general Udet to leave the film industry and join the Ministry of Aviation to establish a model for the Air Force. Afterwards, he began to train 100,000 young aviation personnel and 1,100 personnel for air raid defense. Some colleagues also opposed it. His way of doing things has a bit of a businessman's "seeking quick profits" style, and lacks the special style of a German soldier. His character is not as strict and resolute as a military man, but has a bit of gentleness. Milch also has two colleagues who are also outstanding talents, one is Kesselring, and the other is Sperrle. They and Goering and Milch are all generals. Kesselring was an artillery officer in the last war, the same as Milch. In 1935, he changed to the Ministry of Aviation. He participated in the invasion of Poland and commanded the first air force operation. He is tall and lively, originally from Bavaria, and can be said to be one of the most important senior generals in the German Air Force.</p>
<p>Sperrle is completely of Prussian military color - solid, serious, simple and decisive. In the last war, he was shot down in a plane and seriously injured. During the Spanish Civil War, he led the Air Force to assist Franco in combat, and hundreds of elite German pilots practiced tactics under his guidance. In addition, there is also a central figure in the German Air Force, General Geibona, who succeeded General Wever as the Chief of Staff of the German Air Force in 1937.</p>
<p>Outsiders do not know the actual strength of the German Air Force at present. According to pre-war estimates, at the end of 1939, the German Air Force had 8,000 to 10,000 aircraft in the first line. In the past four years, the German aircraft production volume has increased rapidly. Since the start of the war, it has not been reduced. Therefore, the above number should not be insufficient, and may even be exceeded.</p>

<h3>Liangxi's Basketball Skills Are Too Poor – Paramount Wins Again – China-West Match Nanyang Loses to Giants – Li Hengzhai Purchases Ball for 1,100 Yuan</h3>
<p>The fourth game of the Charity Basketball Challenge, Paramount vs. Liangxi, plus a match between the Xiqing Giants and Nanyang's China-West team, two exciting performances, were held at the China Youth Basketball Hall last night starting at 8 pm. As a result, Paramount won four games in a row, defeating Liangxi 33-18. Nanyang lost to the Giants 18-21. The Giants are the champions of the Xiqing B Group, with tall bodies. Nanyang had no way to enter. Liangxi's game against Paramount, for the first thirty minutes, was unexpectedly tense and exciting. Liangxi took the lead with 6 points first. Later, Paramount could only lead by one or two points. Until the last ten minutes, the entire Liangxi army disintegrated. Liangxi's offense and defense were excellent last night, and the ball was not wasted, so that Paramount could not use its skills. It is a pity that the basketball skills are too poor, and it is impossible to win.</p>
<p>Unprecedented High Price for Auctioning the Game Ball</p>
<p>Last night, because there were two good games, the audience was only slightly less than the game between Shanghai Star and Paramount. The order was very good. During the half-time break, Yuan Ludeng, the chairman of the Nanjing Academy, auctioned the game ball. It was first opened at 100 yuan, and after increasing to 600 yuan, Mr. Zhou Junxian suddenly opened an amazing high price of 1,000 yuan. Mr. Li Hengzhai did not want to be outdone in doing good deeds, and finally purchased it at an unprecedented high price of 1,100 yuan. His benevolence and righteousness are admirable.</p>
<p>Nanyang Loses to Xiqing Giants</p>
<p>Nanyang vs. Giants took the stage first. Nanyang recently won the United Cup A2 Group Championship, and its momentum is strong. The Giants are tall and strong. At the beginning of the game, Han Longhai scored first, and the Giant Sha Sijin returned the favor. Xie Luoyun threw a belt penalty, and reversed to lead 4-2. Since then, the Giants have been going smoothly, and instantly led 10-2. Seeing the situation was not good, Nanyang cooperated to counterattack. The first half ended, and Nanyang was 4-12 behind. After changing baskets, Nanyang quickly caught up. Han Longhai was extremely active and scored points one after another. They once chased to 16-18, only two points behind. However, the Giant Sha Sijin threw one and penalized one, adding three points again. When Han Longhai threw it in, the statutory time had arrived, and Nanyang finally lost miserably by a difference of three points with 18-21. This game was presented with two pennants by the Youyou Sports Association. The Giants and Nanyang each won one. The scores of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Giants Fouls Nanyang Fouls</p>

<p>Paramount Wins Against Liangxi Again</p>
<p>The Paramount vs. Liangxi game continued. Paramount took the field with Li Zhenzhong, Chen Xianglong, Feng Nianhua, Zhang Shaoqing, and Lu Zhongen. Liangxi took the field with Wang Nanqun, Liang Yunming, Zou Ziren, Zhang Shikui, and Zhuo Guorong. Referee Liu Hesheng blew a silver whistle and started the battle. Liangxi rose sharply. After Li Zhenzhong opened the scoring, Zhuo Liang and Wang each scored a goal, and instantly took the lead 6-2. Paramount chased hard, and Feng Li and Zhang had to shoot and hit, creating an 8-8 tie. Later, it became a difficult 10-10 and 12-12 situation. At this time, Liangxi Wang Nanqun unfortunately injured his foot and left the field. Gao Baosheng replaced him, and the situation plummeted. Paramount Chen Xianglong took a shot and chased out with 14-12. When Wang Nanqun re-entered the field, the first half ended, and Liangxi was at a disadvantage with 10-17.

Citibank's current US dollar reached 5.8125 yuan, during which futures were allowed to loosen. The market atmosphere began to turn in the afternoon because there were favorable rumors in the market, and the Hong Kong telegram arrived, indicating foreign banks were taking advantage of the low prices to frequently absorb.

At the same time, the Bank of East Asia bought the US dollar for November delivery at 5.8125 yuan and 84375 yuan from its peers. HSBC then took advantage of the low prices to absorb slightly, and it became stable. Sassoon and Co. absorbed the US dollar for October delivery at 5.8125 yuan.

At noon, HSBC issued the British pound for November delivery to its peers at 3 shillings 7.5 pence. The closing price was 3 shillings 7.1875 pence for the British pound and 5.75 yuan for the US dollar.</p>

Later, they were eager to eat and digest, absorbing speculators' US dollar for October delivery at 5.71875 yuan. At that time, the current US dollar would soften to 5.6875 yuan.

<h3>New Multi-Activity: Gold Prices Wanted to Fall but Stopped</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold market was weak in the morning but recovered with the tightening of the exchange market, and the market atmosphere became firm and stable. As a result, it slightly rose. Initially, due to the weak atmosphere of the previous day and the lengthening of the exchange market, both openly and secretly, the selling atmosphere was quite strong for a time. The Qian-Dui industry and banking groups competed to sell short. At one point, a new recent low of 5,575 yuan was created. Fortunately, the foreign exchange rate tightened, and new multi-buyers became active. Seeing the situation, securities companies and banks covered their shorts. Rumors spread that the US Atlantic garrison was withdrawing to its original defense positions. Therefore, by the evening, it rose to 5,725 yuan. The closing price also had 5,715 yuan, which was 10 yuan higher than the previous day. More than 4,000 taels were traded throughout the day. The price of jewelry gold at the gold shops ultimately remained flat. The customs gold price remained fixed.</p>
<p>The Spot Gold Rose by 10 Yuan</p>
<p>The exchange market loosened in the early morning, and the market momentum was weak. The opening price was 55 yuan lower. The silver firm offered 10 taels of gold,逊逊(unreadable) was 5,650 yuan. As securities companies and banks sold heavily, and the foreign exchange rate loosened for a time, buyers were reluctant. It fell into the 5,600 yuan mark, retreating to 5,590 yuan. Later, the exchange market stabilized slightly, and buyers began to become active. The supply was felt to be greater than demand for the amount. The securities companies covered their shorts and the bank's new multi-purchases accounted for more, and it suddenly rose to 5,660 yuan. However, because the exchange market loosened again, gold shops and Qian-Dui industries competed to sell. At this time, another silver firm suddenly came to sell short a lot, and it was re-suppressed to the low price of 5,570 yuan. After 11:00, the foreign exchange rate stopped loosening and recovered slightly, and the market momentum reappeared hardening. The bank bulls increased their bets, and the securities companies came to cover their shorts. Before the close, it rose again to 5,660 yuan. However, the noon closing price fell slightly, to 5,645 yuan. The market opened in the afternoon, and there were very few sellers, so it was raised to 5,670 yuan. Although Qian-Dui industries and securities companies released, it fell to 5,645 yuan. But not long after, the exchange market reported a tight market, and the buying trend rose sharply. Banks and gangs absorbed it, and it rose to 5,710 yuan. After this, the buying wind stopped for a time, and it fell to 5,680 yuan. However, the exchange market continued to weaken, and securities companies and banks furiously covered their shorts. A few even turned from short to long. The multiple parties took the opportunity to pick up prices, and then rose to 5,725 yuan. Before the close, the floating multiples were slightly settled, and they fell back 30 yuan. However, people's hearts seemed to have turned better, and there were many buyers at low prices, so the evening closing price rose to 5,715 yuan. As a result, it rose by 10 yuan compared to the previous day. The whole day rose and fell by 150 yuan. The cash number's own brand gold selling price was more than ten yuan higher than the spot gold price. The purchase was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold is more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there is little trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Fell and Then Returned</p>
<p>The gold jewelry at the silver shops, for each tael sold, hung small ten yuan at 10:30, and returned to ten yuan at 3:30 in the afternoon. As a result, the major peers still suspended 590 yuan, and the new peers were similar to the previous price. The purchase was reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Fell and Then Returned</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: The spot gold fell and then rose. The British and American gold pounds also fell first and then returned flat. The British gold ticket fell by five jiao because the black market British pound and US dollar were long. The US gold ticket initially retreated to 16.85 yuan. Later, because of widespread reports that the international situation had improved, people's hearts revived, and it was raised to 17.30 yuan in the afternoon, but it was still five fen lower than the previous day. The Hong Kong ticket fell sharply as the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate fell, and the supply from all parties was quite strong. The Japanese gold ticket supply and demand were uniform, and the market price stood flat. The evening market still stood at the original price of 1.45 yuan. The Korean ticket slightly weakened, and the evening market was 1.15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grains: Imported Rice Rose and Fell Frequently, New Japonica Rice Arrival Not Weak</h3>
<p>The rice market turned into a hovering situation. Yesterday, the initial opening was due to the tired momentum of the previous afternoon, and people's hearts were still weak. Floating households continued to come out, and the sales field was called lonely. In addition, the goods on the way arrived in Shanghai one after another, and large ticket orders could arrive in port in the near future. Moreover, the exchange rate loosened again, and continued planning. The market was weak with people's hearts, and the price of the new Japonica rice that arrived continued to fall by one yuan to one yuan and thirty-five jiao. At the lowest time, No. 2 Saigon opened at only 65 yuan, No. 2 Luojia at 63 yuan, and small fine grain at 62.5 yuan. However, after this drop, there was quite a low-price activity. Not only the shorts, but also the general actual sales, did more procurement. Suddenly, the buying atmosphere turned strong, and the market color returned tighter. As a result, it was only slightly depreciated. The price of No. 1 Saigon was 71.5 yuan, No. 2 Saigon was 66 yuan, then 65.5 yuan, No. 2 Luojia was 64.5 yuan, 64 yuan, small fine grain was 63.5 yuan, 63 yuan, rice chaff was 54.8 yuan, 64 yuan, and Wuhu pointed grain was 62 yuan. However, because the exchange rate shrank in the afternoon, the goods were unwilling to lightly trade, and there was a Shantou gang who inquired, so the original package of No. 2 Saigon, which had once opened at 77.5 yuan in the morning, was then raised to 78 yuan, and after the year to 78.5 yuan. The current rice also followed by five or six jiao, and as a result, it was still seven or eight jiao smaller than the previous market. No. 1 Saigon opened at 71.5 yuan, 71 yuan, middle at 69.5 yuan, No. 2 at 65.8 yuan to 64.5 yuan, Luojia No. 2 at 63.5 yuan to 62.7 yuan, fire fine grain at 71.5 yuan to 70 yuan, and small fine grain at 63 yuan to 62.5 yuan. A total of 5,000 bags of current rice and 200 tons of original bags were opened and traded throughout the day.</p>
<p>Imported Rice Has Arrived in Shanghai Again: The Taikoo Company's Anhui ship arrived at the port the night before last (7th) at about 7:00, loaded with 2,764 bags from Hong Kong, and was berthed at the company's wharf on the Bund of the French Concession to unload.</p>
<p>The supply and demand of both domestic and foreign glutinous rice were similar, and there was no gain or loss. Although the thick and thin broken japonica rice has been exhausted, the market is also scarce, but because the price is extremely expensive, it is not easy to sell. Moreover, it is 相相(unreadable) by other goods, resulting in a drop of one yuan. The early rice of Nanhang opened at 87 yuan, then 85 yuan.</p>
<p>The arrival of new japonica pointed rice and cellar seed rice continued to have two or three thousand shih, but the Middle Yang pointed rice suddenly heard of being out of stock, so the Yang pointed rice had no market. The arrival of Du pointed rice was limited and flat, selling for 70 yuan, then 65.5 yuan. The new japonica rice and cellar seed rice were tired because the arrival and sales were uneven, with a drop of one yuan. The Minhang new japonica rice opened at 79 yuan to 77 yuan, and the Xitang cellar seed opened at 78 yuan, 77.5 yuan. The Jiaolixiang japonica rice was also on the market yesterday, opening at 82 yuan.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Imported Flour Will Arrive</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's market turned from firm to flat. It was found that the amount of imported wheat set by the factory was limited, so production was insufficient, and the quantity allocated was still scarce, which was not enough to meet the needs of this street. Therefore, the situation of rolling spot was already formed. Yesterday, the wholesale price of this street was still 16.5 yuan for the original market, while the customer market needed 18.5 yuan. The customers slightly added to the procurement, but the amount was also small. As for the transaction of recycled old car flour, because a large number of imported flour was about to arrive, people's hearts gradually became quieter, so the buying and selling became quiet again. The imported flour also loosened by two or three jiao, and the price was 18.45 yuan.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the price of wheat was clearly fixed and secretly discounted, because road transportation was difficult, and the arrival of cars and ships was scattered. The Japanese factory still limited the purchase price to 21 yuan, and the Chinese factory was also reluctant to release prices to absorb because the goods were scarce. As for the concession, because there were inland gangs and hoarders procuring, the asking price once reached 27 yuan, but there was no agreement. The situation is still brewing.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Speculation Unanimously Leaned Towards Buying, Yarn Prices Not Easy to Fall</h3>
<p>The yarn market entered a roundabout route again, but people's hearts were still considered good, because the Hong Kong gang's demand for 10-count coarse yarn was still not weakening. At the same time, speculation had a unanimous tendency to purchase, so although the exchange rate was lengthening step by step, the buyer's morale did not show a decline. According to the current situation, most of them are doing more and seeing higher. Therefore, the market is not easy to relax. Checking the situation on the market, it is said that some people are doing it, only seeing the big, not the small. Today, 595 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The spot yarn opened in the morning, and the popularity in the market did not show weakness. The general opinion was that the decline still tended to drag in, so although the asking price was small, there were still very few sellers. The first market price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,170 yuan. Suddenly, it was heard that it rose to 1,185 yuan. Then, it was heard that the US dollar was lengthening greatly, and the gold companies and grab-hat companies released one after another, and the market disk returned to fall, falling to 1,155 yuan. However, those who profited from the low price covered, and more parties were active again, and the market disk gradually rebounded to 1,167 yuan. After closing, it rose by another ten yuan. According to the statistics of transactions in half a day, 5,355 bales were traded, and the market price fell by ten yuan. The amount of purchases by each gang is listed as follows: 同同行(Unreadable) 4,400 Hong Kong 955 Statistics 5,355</p>
<h3>Fellow Traders Were Hoarding, Cotton Had a Market but No Sales</h3>
<p>The spot cotton transaction was like a standstill. This was because the exchange rate was lengthening day by day, but the yarn market rose and fell from time to time, resulting in uneven morale. However, recently, the amount of yarn prices that have risen is not small. The proportion of flower prices is fresher than yarn, so the holders are extremely unwilling to let go, and then there is a market but no sales.</p>
<p>Tongzhou 192.00 森太近(Unreadable) 97 bags</p>
<p>康笛許(Unreadable) 219.00 永記德(Unreadable) 10 pieces</p>
<p>Another message: The foreign cotton market price, the New York cotton market, was uneven. Because all parties were waiting for the government to announce the field report tomorrow, there was a slight southern 套賣(Unreadable) yesterday. As a result, the closing price was one or two pounds lower than the previous day's tone. The India-linked price rose by one rupee.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton transaction was slightly quiet yesterday. In fact, the market has insufficient inventory, fellow traders have a high mindset, and they are all unwilling to sell samples. The factory's purchasing intentions were quite strong, but it was difficult to buy. The loosening of the exchange rate did not affect the cotton market and instead saw a high price.</p>
<h3>Securities: C Stocks Drawn to More Than Ten Percent, Returned to Original Price in Two Hours</h3>
<p>Six-Li-Li British Gold Bonds Drawn by Lot, Foreign Stocks Fell First and Then Rose</p>
<p>Yesterday's securities dark market, the market situation was flat and slightly tired in the morning, but Dingzhong was only small, and the price was the same as the even drawn lottery price in the morning, which shows that the demand was suddenly hot after the lottery was drawn. In the afternoon, the buying atmosphere of No. 41 was extremely strong, and it was impossible to suppress the market. Yesterday morning, the selling atmosphere was more surging, and No. 24 sold more than 200,000. Lianyi also sold off, but Xinchang Jufeng bought in, and the market price was 之殃象(Unreadable). At that time, the selling atmosphere of No. 41 was extremely strong, and Renchang also sold a lot, but the buyers felt even more enthusiastic. Tongsheng Tongkang Runde Shunchang Lianyi Hongda absorbed one after another. The C stocks still穿(Unreadable) out eight yuan.

<p>In the stock transaction, 100 shares of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 16.3 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the opening of the public stock market was still soft, and the price was slightly lower than the previous close. Soon, the bulls settled again like a tide, and the prices of the stocks fell again. The decline of Jardine Matheson was particularly fierce, and the lowest price was 66 yuan. Until the midday, because the news was better and the exchange market tended to tighten, the price began to turn around. After a very short-lived profit settlement in the afternoon, the market situation improved even more. At the close, the stocks all had good buyers. Jardine Matheson retreated sharply and rose rapidly, returning to 74.5 yuan at the close. Other famous stocks also had a considerable rebound. The rubber stocks were particularly good, and the stocks of various Dutch companies were traded in large quantities.</p>

The rest remain unchanged.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Market Momentum Shakes</h3>
<p>Recently, the soybean market situation has been driven by the oil price, and the exit is not lonely, so the market atmosphere is quite handsome.

<h3>Piece Goods: Cloth is Being Purchased Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cloth market, with the vigorous absorption of the Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs, the morale was revitalized, and the hoarders also stopped selling and buying.

It was heard that 78 points of white factory had sold at a new low price of 5,050 yuan, a huge drop of 200 yuan from last week. The situation between Japan and the United States is dangerous, the price of gold is falling, and Sino-US transportation may become a problem, so there is this decline.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Step Down</h3>

<h3>US State Department Issues Instructions: Advising Overseas Chinese in the Far East to Evacuate; US Policy Towards the Far East Becomes Increasingly Firm; American Nationals in Shanghai Await Official Notification</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources from Western circles yesterday, the State Department in Washington has instructed all US consulates in the Far East to urge American nationals residing in China (including the Northeast), Hong Kong, and Vietnam to return to their country as soon as possible. It is understood that American nationals, especially women and children, have been ordered to evacuate quickly. Chinese circles in Shanghai believe that this development may be a prelude to the US entering the European war. Chinese sources further stated that this development should not be taken lightly, as Socony-Vacuum and Texaco issued suggestions just three days ago, advising families of American staff to return to the US as soon as possible. It was also said at the time that staff of Chase Bank and Citibank had also received similar advice.</p>
<p>Official Circular Soon to Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>It is understood that, regarding travel and residence of US citizens, the State Department has equated the Far East with Europe, and that this action is a precautionary step, not based on any particular development in the Far East, but arising from general instability. Currently, the difficulty faced by families of Socony-Vacuum and Texaco staff is the issue of transpacific travel. It is anticipated that American merchant ships may be diverted to Chinese waters to assist the evacuation of American nationals. A formal advisory circular is expected to reach American nationals in China within the next few days. It is generally believed that families of officers in the Asiatic Fleet currently residing in China will also be affected by this new action. American sources say that the actions of American commercial firms in Shanghai will follow the lead of Socony-Vacuum and Texaco.</p>
<p>The United States Has Given a De Facto Response</p>
<p>The English-language "China Press" carried a commentary yesterday by the well-known commentator Woodhead, stating that the US has maintained a neutral policy towards the current European war, and although it has provided material assistance to the Allied countries as much as possible, it has not yet sent a single soldier to Europe to fight. However, whether the US will continue to maintain its neutrality in the future will depend on the decisions made by Germany, Italy, or Japan.</p>
<p>The United States Will Not Adopt Criminal Policies</p>
<p>Japanese Prime Minister Konoe, in a recent statement to journalists, openly threatened the US, stating that if the US does not recognize the demands of the Axis powers (including Japan) and actively cooperate with Japan in building a "New Order in East Asia," Japan will "not hesitate to fight." From the US point of view, such a request is tantamount to inviting the US to be an accomplice in a grave international crime. In fact, regardless of which party is in power in the US, it will never adopt a policy of cooperating with Japan to commit such a crime.</p>
<p>The Whole Country Unanimously Supports China</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, US policy towards the Far East has been extremely firm, and today, US policy is even firmer than before. The Roosevelt administration has openly supported a free China, and even Roosevelt's political rival (Willkie) has publicly advocated doing everything possible to help the Chongqing government. Konoe's threat has had the impact on US public opinion that we had anticipated.</p>
<p>Konoe's Threat Provokes a Strong Reaction</p>
<p>The US has now made it clear that the US government will not allow Konoe or any other Japanese official to undermine the newly implemented policy. The first response of the US to Konoe's threat was the call-up of 27,000 naval reservists. When announcing this decision, the Secretary of the Navy warned his country that the "time of testing" for the Axis powers was near. The Japanese government should be aware of the current position of the US.</p>
<p>Most of Humanity Awaits Salvation</p>
<p>Dictators in Europe and militarist warlords in the Far East "are determined to build their 'New Order.'" All freedom-loving people oppose this "New Order." Under this "New Order," countless people are sacrificed. The realization of the "New Order" is tantamount to imposing despair and misery on most of humanity. Looking at the people of Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Abyssinia, and the occupied territories of France and China, can it be said that there is any joy in life under the "New Order"? These people endure humiliation and live only in the hope of salvation by those who uphold justice, and the restoration of their lost freedom.</p>
<h3>US Embassy Secretary and Others Return to the US for Vacation in Succession</h3>
<p>The President Cleveland, a mail steamer of the US President Lines, set sail from Shanghai on the afternoon of the previous day. It is understood that Mr. and Mrs. Grindle, Secretary of the US Embassy in Beijing, and Mr. Feder, US Consul in Chongqing and Xiamen, all boarded the ship to return to the US for vacation in succession. They will return to China upon the expiration of their leave.</p>
<h3>British Admiral Knoble Passes Through Shanghai and Embarks on a Voyage Back to His Country, With a Stopover in Canada</h3>
<p>According to official sources yesterday, Admiral Knoble, the former commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, relinquished his post in Hong Kong and handed over his duties to Admiral Leighton. He arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 7th aboard the Empress of Russia. It is understood that Knoble boarded the same ship the night before last and sailed to the United Kingdom via Canada. It is currently unknown whether he will be assigned to a new position after arriving in the UK. Chinese newspapers reported yesterday that Knoble held a meeting with Admiral Hart of the US Asiatic Fleet during his brief stay in Shanghai, but British authorities here claim they are unaware of any such meeting. However, they continued to say that Knoble may have paid a private friendly visit to Admiral Hart.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow, the Whole City Will Enthusiastically Celebrate National Day by Displaying Flags; Various Organizations Send Telegrams to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to Express Respect; Unanimously Promoting the National Day Donation and Construction Movement</h3>
<p>Tomorrow is the Double Tenth National Day Anniversary. All sectors of the city, in addition to celebrating by displaying flags in accordance with the eight-day flag display method agreed upon by various public organizations and the concession authorities, all agencies, public organizations, schools, as well as the banking and money industries, and various market places will be closed as usual. All sectors, in order to support national policy and enhance the foundation of the country, will unanimously promote National Day donations, collect winter clothing donations, national construction savings, and frugality and disaster relief movements. The National Day Winter Clothing Donation Movement Week, advocated by the city's Fundraising and慰勞 (comforting/supporting) 代金 (substitute money) Committee, is also scheduled to begin tomorrow. All companies, shops, and factories will hold charity sales for a week. Individuals will contribute one day's income as winter clothing substitute money, striving to achieve the target of raising one million yuan for winter clothing substitute money, to be presented with doubled respect. The two concession authorities, in order to prevent unscrupulous elements from engaging in activities during the National Day Anniversary, have implemented joint security measures since yesterday. All non-essential roads and lanes have been scheduled to be blocked off from midnight today to cut off traffic. The police in both concessions will dispatch additional detectives and patrol teams tomorrow morning to patrol the roads to ensure strict prevention.</p>
<p>Telegrams to Chairman Chiang to Offer Comfort and Respect</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lide Fellowship Association, the Wuxi Shanghai Alumni Association, the Wujin Shanghai Alumni Association, the Dechong Sports Association, the Riri Service Society, the Mutual Aid Fellowship Association of Primary and Secondary School Teachers, the Qingpu Shanghai Alumni Association, the National Products Sales Society, the United Association of Factory Partners, the Women's Triple Education Association, the Taixing Shanghai Alumni Association, the Ning Shao Shanghai Alumni Association, the Electrical Workers Fellowship Association, and other groups, in light of tomorrow being the National Day holiday, and in view of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's supervision of the war of resistance, with frequent news of victories, hard work and great achievements, and the prospect of victory in sight, have sent telegrams to Chongqing to express their highest respect.</p>
<p>Various Sectors Stipulate Methods for Frugality and Construction</p>
<p>The Lide Fellowship Association yesterday announced to all sectors and its members that on National Day, each will donate one day's income, and stipulated that from October 10th to October 16th, it will be a Frugality and Construction Savings Movement Week, instructing each member to promote it separately. In order to adapt to the Shanghai environment, the following methods have been specifically formulated: (1) Each member should unite ten non-member relatives and friends to form a Frugality and National Construction Savings Group; (2) The savings of each group can open a public account name and be deposited into a bank monthly; (3) Each country should appoint one director to be responsible for collecting savings and keeping the deposit book; (4) Each member should determine the amount of silver they are willing to save each month according to their ability, and should not reduce or stop it midway; (5) This savings is to be deposited into the bank using a zero-deposit, lump-sum withdrawal method, with a fixed period of at least two years; (6) After the term expires, each group will decide on a method of use under the major goal of national construction work that is beneficial. The association also believes that this method is an excellent opportunity for citizens in the concessions to express their patriotic enthusiasm automatically in an extraordinary environment, so it requests all sectors to strive to imitate and promote it, and deeply hopes that every citizen will not be confused by the smog and haze, and not be intoxicated by the bright lights and fine wines, but should quickly strictly adhere to their posts, practice frugality, and preserve vitality for their children and grandchildren, and not be sinners of the nation.</p>
<p>Foreign Ships in the Huangpu River Display Flags to Celebrate Together</p>
<p>The US flagship Augusta and a small ship, as well as two British and French shallow-water gunboats, are docked in the Huangpu River. On this day, except for Japanese ships, all foreign ships and customs ships will uniformly display flags to celebrate China's National Day. At that time, colorful flags will fly on each ship, fluttering in the wind, greatly enhancing the color of the Huangpu River, which is enough to symbolize the revival of China.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops in the Suburbs of Shanghai Increase Patrols</p>
<p>Although the people in the western suburbs of this port are in a bad environment, they deeply expect resistance and national construction. Therefore, the mood on this day is also very excited. However, the Japanese garrison in the suburbs has recently felt uneasy due to the active guerrilla teams in the suburbs, and has doubled the number of posts on the important streets and dispatched teams to patrol back and forth to inspect pedestrians.</p>
<h3>The Singapore Naval Base Is Immensely Powerful; Foreign Reporters Visit the Facilities; A Mass of Cranes and Hoists Are Amazing</h3>
<p>A certain American reporter, who recently visited the British military base in Singapore and then transferred to Shanghai, said that they had obtained permission from the British military authorities to visit the British military base in Singapore. There were more than 20 reporters from Australia and the United States. Due to military relations, the equipment there could not be fully revealed. But for those who opened their eyes, it was already greatly strengthened. It is worthy of being a world's large naval base. Among the naval bases, the size of the docks and the number of ships are unprecedented. Hundreds of Malay sailors are being trained there. Generally, the officers are looking forward to this non-seaman, who will be able to form a "Royal Malay Navy." At that time, most of the regular naval teams were ordered to go to sea, and the resident troops were practicing artillery firing, using the assumed target of the ocean as an enemy battleship to aim and sink. They then visited the air force base, and they were very interested in the new type of air defense weapons. Everyone said that the British military base in Singapore is indeed, as King George VI said, a symbol of Britain's determination to maintain peace. The so-called maintaining peace means eliminating aggression and pacifying chaos. Now that Germany, Italy, and Japan have formed a military alliance, and the United Kingdom and the United States feel threatened by the Axis powers, it is expected that the British military base in Singapore will soon be able to exert its power, with British and American fleets concentrated to guard it, so that invaders in the Far East dare not face it directly.</p>
<h3>American National Mayer Returns Swindled Money; American Authorities Still Investigate and Prosecute; However, Criminal Conviction Is Expected to Be Reduced</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that Mayer, an American national living in Shanghai, recently suggested to the French national Heiman Tingge that he be commissioned with a ship, thereby swindling him out of 10,000 yuan. After Heiman sued the US Consular Court in China, an arrest warrant was issued. It was recently heard that Mayer had entrusted someone to transfer the 10,000 yuan to Heiman on Sunday in the hope of settling the case privately. However, the US authorities are still issuing an arrest warrant for Mayer, because according to American law, Mayer's return of the swindled money does not eliminate the crime he committed. Once Mayer is arrested and brought to justice, he will still be prosecuted for the fraud case. However, since the swindled money has been returned, his punishment may be reduced. If Mayer or his allies (who are not American and not subject to the jurisdiction of the Consular Court) do not appear in court to prove Mayer's fraudulent behavior, then this case may be dismissed. Also, the Great Evening News reported that the rumor that Mayer had escaped to Ningbo could not be confirmed. According to the US authorities, Mayer's arrest, or even his surrender, is only a matter of time. At present, all ports in the Far East are implementing strict regulations. Mayer wants to leave Shanghai and escape elsewhere, which is impossible. According to reports, Mayer is the younger brother of Mayer Lewis, a shareholder of the American MGM Film Company.</p>

<h3>Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council Food Committee Issues Opinions on the Rice Market; Explains Criticisms from All Parties; Believes That Limiting Rice Brokers Does Not Help the Situation</h3>
<p>Mr. Marshall, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council Food Committee, yesterday issued his opinions on the rice market in this port. First, he said that it is rare for the various committees of the Municipal Council to make public announcements in the name of the chairman, but in view of the fact that this committee is not a normal committee of the Municipal Council, and because the Director-General and Director-General/President have repeatedly insisted, he wrote an article to express his opinions as follows.</p>
<p>Repeatedly Contacted and Coordinated with the Japanese Side</p>
<p>The first thing to be stated is that I do not want to criticize other authorities, because they have suffered special difficulties. What I want to express is limited to the policies adopted by this committee and its opinions on the rice market. The measures taken by the Municipal Council for the rice market are based on the recommendations of this committee. Recently, rice prices have soared, and the outside world believes that the Municipal Council has not taken appropriate measures and cannot stop the rise in rice prices, which has been criticized quite a lot. Furthermore, due to the recent remarks of "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an in his interview with the North China Daily News reporter, some people's minds may have an impression that the Municipal Council not only stood idly by, but also was unwilling to cooperate with the authorities in the neighboring areas. Therefore, it is necessary to solemnly explain in order to correct the record.</p>
<p>The Municipal Council has requested the Japanese authorities to find ways to clear up the source of domestic rice more than once, and has repeatedly expressed its willingness to cooperate fully with all relevant parties in order to ensure that domestic rice can be transported to Shanghai smoothly and without obstruction. In July of this year, "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an suggested to the Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council that the three municipal authorities send representatives to jointly review the food problem in this port. The Municipal Council agreed with the above suggestion and sent myself and the secretary of this committee, etc., on July 16th to attend a meeting in the city center to discuss how to improve the rice market and decided to organize a joint committee to study ways to improve the rice market and resolved that "Mayor" Chuan should convene a second meeting. On the 20th of the same month, the Municipal Council appointed committee member Mr. Merlo, Secretary Mr. Pisley, and myself as the Municipal Council representatives. At the same time, the French Municipal Council also appointed several representatives, but "Mayor" Chuan never convened a meeting afterwards.</p>
<p>Only Hope That the Rice Market Will Stop Raising Prices</p>
<p>The transportation of domestic rice from the producing areas to Shanghai has been subject to various restrictions and cannot be transported to Shanghai smoothly, so that the residents of the concession have to rely on the supply of foreign rice. This committee believes that if the selling price of foreign rice is restricted, it cannot exceed its cost plus a reasonable profit, which will not only be of no help, but will also be harmful. We must recognize the fact that it is better to obtain rice at a high price than to have no rice to buy, because if merchants trade without profit, they will inevitably stop purchasing. This committee hopes to stop raising prices, but believes that restricting the selling price below its cost will cause many dangers. Therefore, it is willing to invite outside criticism rather than recommending such erroneous steps to the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>This committee is not unaware that some people are hoarding rice and selling it at a high price, but hoarding rice is not only in danger of mildew, but also in danger of suffering significant losses due to falling rice prices, especially when the mainland relaxes its ban and domestic rice floods in. In the current turbulent world situation, the most urgent task is to store sufficient rice to prevent shipping from being blocked. Any crude regulations will only stop the ordering of foreign rice. As for the general merchants' pre-storage of goods, we really have nothing to object to, because they must rely on their inventory to supply the market continuously.</p>
<p>Since the Municipal Council has no way to control the source of domestic rice, nor can it order large quantities of foreign rice to transport to Shanghai to aid the market, the disposal of the rice market must be carefully planned to avoid hindering the ordering of foreign rice by merchants or individuals.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops' Failed Attack on Yangcheng Lake; Have Retreated to Suzhou</h3>
<p>At 9:00 am on September 29th, more than 100 Japanese troops, traveling in four motorboats, attacked Yangcheng Lake. At Nitan Port, southeast of Taiping Bridge, they encountered the garrison of Hu Zhaohan's troops and engaged in a fierce battle for two hours. Fourteen Japanese soldiers were killed, and many were injured. Eighteen rifles were seized. Unable to withstand the attack, they retreated to Suzhou. It is heard that the Japanese troops in Suzhou are very weak, and the garrisons in the small strongholds have been withdrawn.</p>
<h3>Police Authority in the Western District; Negotiations Have Not Been Resumed; Negotiations Have Stalled</h3>
<p>According to a Shanghai Municipal Council spokesperson's statement to Western reporters yesterday, the negotiations on the issue of police authority in the areas outside the boundaries of the roads have reached a standstill. After receiving the opinion letter presented by Major Bowman, Chief Superintendent of the Police Department, the Municipal Council invited Fu Xiao'an to instruct Lu Ying to meet with representatives of the Police Department to discuss this issue, but Fu Xiao'an has not yet arranged for Lu Ying to meet with representatives of the Police Department, so that the two sides have had no opportunity to talk.</p>
<h3>The Wounded Soldiers of the Isolated Battalion; Life in the Camp Is As Stable As Ever</h3>
<p>According to a Shanghai Municipal Council spokesperson's statement to reporters yesterday, Ding Guoshun, the soldier of the isolated battalion who was injured in the attack the day before yesterday (the 7th), is now in Renji Hospital, and his injuries have made satisfactory progress. The spokesperson said that after this incident, the situation in the isolated battalion camp was calm and there were no disputes. The spokesperson did not know the details of the injuries of the other injured Chinese man and woman, because they were taken away by a certain ambulance. However, according to the English-language American Great Evening News, the two Chinese civilians who were hit by stray bullets only suffered minor injuries and were discharged from the hospital after being bandaged.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute at French Company Stalled Again; Two More Ticket Inspectors Were Kidnapped</h3>
<p>The labor dispute between the French Electric and Water Company's tram and bus workers has been deadlocked for thirteen days. The opinions of both labor and management sometimes approach, and sometimes they are suddenly blocked. According to news received yesterday, the negotiations on the afternoon of the 7th broke down again. In addition to agreeing to add 5.5 yuan for rice subsidies and recognize the labor representatives, the management firmly refused to accept the newly formed labor union and a 60% increase in wages, so no solution could be reached. Yesterday, in addition to the labor representatives discussing countermeasures, the two sides did not continue negotiations. It was also learned that at 3 pm yesterday, Huang Yuanji, the ticket inspector No. 18 (from Nanxiang, living on Dagu Road) and Lu Hongjun, the ticket writer No. 27 (living in Xinxin Lane, Dapu Bridge, Rue du Père Froc), were kidnapped at the company's iron gate. It has been found that the company's ticket inspectors and ticket writers have been kidnapped eight times, and their whereabouts are still unknown. It was also reported that the No. 22 bus is still running in the French Concession. According to the company authorities, if the strike continues and is not resolved, they will increase the number of trams and buses and hire new workers to drive them to facilitate transportation. The French police are continuing to investigate the five kidnapped workers, but there are still no clues.</p>
<h3>American Soldier Assaulted and Insulted; Japan Has Officially Replied; Both Sides Do Not Disclose the Contents of the Reply; American Navy Says It Will Issue Another Announcement</h3>
<p>The English-language American Great News reported that the American naval authorities in this city disclosed today (the 8th) that regarding the incident of a crew member of the American ship Augusta being assaulted and insulted by Japanese military police, the Japanese naval and military police authorities stationed in Shanghai replied yesterday (the 7th) to Admiral Haddock, Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet. The reply from the Japanese Navy was signed by Lieutenant General Shimada, Commander of the Japanese Third Fleet stationed in China. The reply from the Japanese military police was signed by Major General Miura, Commander of the Japanese Military Police stationed in Shanghai. This morning, both the American and Japanese authorities refused to disclose the contents of the reply, but American naval officers said that a detailed announcement about this matter may be issued within a few days. According to reports, the incident of the American sailor being assaulted and insulted occurred on September 28 in the Bank of Communications Building at No. 14 The Bund. The relevant authorities have not issued an official announcement about this matter.</p>
<p>Official News</p>
<p>However, the Japanese authorities stated last week that this matter was a "minor drunken quarrel." The Japanese side had received a letter from an officer of the US Navy shore patrol that evening, explaining that the American sailor mistakenly believed that the Japanese military police headquarters in the Bank of Communications Building was a hotel and expressed regret. However, the US naval authorities said that the shore patrol officer's reply was made before he fully understood what had happened. Then, the American authorities in this area sent a note to the Japanese Navy and military police authorities, stating that the case should be further investigated. The Japanese side sent out a reply yesterday.</p>
<h3>Japanese Officer Shot; Died of Serious Injuries</h3>
<p>At about 10:00 am the day before yesterday, a Japanese army trainee officer, Imai Yoshio, was suddenly shot and wounded in the abdomen and chest in front of the Xujiahui Cathedral. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now heard that the officer died yesterday due to the severity of his injuries.</p>
<h3>French Ambassador Cosme Finances Chinese Students; Establishes a Grant at Aurora University; Gifts 1,000 Yuan to the Top Students in Each Department</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Shanghai: Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the economic situation of the majority of Chinese students has been extremely difficult. French Ambassador to China Cosme was deeply moved and has been continuously financing Chinese students for three years. Up to this year, he has established a special grant at Aurora University in this city, called the "Cosme Fund," and formed a committee to manage it.

<h3>French Concession Chinese Inspector Gong Bida Was Shot; Two Bullets Did Not Penetrate, and His Injuries Were Very Serious; The Gunman Escaped, and the Reason Is Awaiting Investigation</h3>
<p>At the entrance of Ri Hui Li, Rue du Père Froc, in the French Concession, Deputy Chinese Inspector Gong Bida was suddenly shot by a rioter yesterday afternoon. Two shots hit his back, and his injuries were very serious. The perpetrator took the opportunity to escape without a trace. The details are listed below:</p>
<p>Served for a Long Time</p>
<p>Deputy Inspector Gong Bida (No. 210) of the Lukouwan Police Station is from Hubei and is 45 years old. He has served in the police station for 15 years. He rents at No. 25 Ri Hui Li, Xinxin Street, Rue du Père Froc, and is a second landlord. He and his wife, Ms. Mou, are inseparable and have a strong relationship. At about 12:30 pm yesterday, Gong was off duty in his dark blue uniform and was returning to his residence for lunch by rickshaw.</p>
<p>Hit by Two Bullets</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, just as the rickshaw arrived at the entrance of Ri Hui Li, a rioter wearing a blue cloth shirt and pants also came after him on a bicycle. Without asking the reason, he drew a gun and shot him twice. At that time, although Xi was wearing a police pistol, he was caught off guard and was shot in the back. The bullets did not penetrate, and he fainted and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. Seeing that the goal had been achieved, the rioter hurriedly put away the gun and escaped on a bicycle.</p>
<p>Taken to the Hospital</p>
<p>After the incident, witnesses in the lane immediately reported to his family. When his wife rushed over, she saw Gong had fallen to the ground. She immediately called the police on duty and summoned an ambulance to the scene to take him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Because the police station was nearby, after hearing the alarm, they quickly drove a police car to the scene of the incident to arrest the perpetrator, but the perpetrator had disappeared. They picked up two bullet casings and took them back to the police station for inspection.</p>
<p>Reason Unknown</p>
<p>It is reported that although Gong's injuries were serious after being admitted to the hospital, he was still conscious. The doctor was preparing to perform surgery to remove the bullets, but due to excessive blood loss, his life could not be predicted. It is also learned that the police station is because Gong is diligent in his work and shrewd and capable. The reason why he was shot by a gangster this time is unknown. Now the police chief has ordered Chinese and Western police officers to track down the rioter and bring him to justice.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong's Freight Transportation to the Soviet Union Is Exceptionally Developed; The British Government Prevents Transshipment to Germany; Chinese Authorities' Certification Is Required</h3>
<p>Since the Sino-Soviet barter trade agreement, China's trade with the Soviet Union has used Hong Kong as a transshipment center, and then transshipped to Vladivostok for sale to the Soviet Union. However, in order to strengthen the blockade, the British government has certain restrictions on exports to the Soviet Union to prevent transshipment from the Soviet Union to Germany. For Chinese native products transported from Hong Kong to the Soviet Union, an export certificate from the Chinese trade authority must be obtained before they can be loaded on a ship and exported from Hong Kong. It is learned that Hong Kong's trade with the Soviet Union is booming. From January to August this year, Hong Kong's trade with the Soviet Union totaled HK$53,274,690, more than doubling the same period last year. Compared with more than 6 million yuan in the same period of the previous year, the increase is even greater. Almost all the goods exported from Hong Kong to the Soviet Union are Chinese native products, with tea being the largest item, totaling 14.7 million yuan, an increase of more than 5 million yuan compared with 9 million yuan last year. The second largest item is ore, totaling more than 11 million yuan, of which tin ore, tungsten ore, and antimony ore are the most numerous, an increase of more than 20 times compared with last year. The next largest item is tung oil, which is 2.6 million yuan, and bristles and raw hides rank fourth, with 2.3 million yuan. As for the goods transported from the Soviet Union to Hong Kong, they total only 4.7 million yuan. The goods transported from the Soviet Union to China are all transported to China via the Sino-Soviet Highway. Recently, the China-Italy Company's Grand Wheel was rented to a Russian merchant to load a large amount of tea and tung oil in Hong Kong and transport them to Vladivostok for transshipment to the Soviet Union. The ship departed from Hong Kong yesterday and went to Keelung to load coal before heading straight to Vladivostok.</p>
<h3>Gold Bonds and National Defense Bonds Will Be Repaid and Interest Paid on Schedule</h3>
<p>The principal and interest of the 27th Year Public Bonds and the third National Defense Bonds have been drawn by the National Debt Fund Management Committee. The Ministry of Finance has announced that payments will begin on October 31. The principal and interest of the gold bonds will be deducted from October 31 of the 29th year for a period of six years. The National Defense Bonds will be paid from October 31 of the 29th year for a period of three years. The interest coupons attached to the winning bond tickets should be returned to the bank by the ticket holder when receiving the principal. If there is a shortage, it will be deducted from the principal silver due.</p>
<h3>Younger Brother Plots to Kill Older Brother, Both Confess to Crimes; Zhu Qitai Found to Have No Involvement and Granted Release</h3>
<p>Zhou Xiude, a Chaozhou native residing at No. 49, Fengyu Lane, Sapo Sai Road in the French Concession, recently became addicted to gambling, and his family's financial resources were extremely meager. Overwhelmed with debt, he conceived a sinister idea because his older brother, Zhou Xiuzheng, held the important position of treasurer at the Liyuan Customs Brokerage at No. 19, Gongguan Road in the French Concession. He plotted to kill him and seize his wealth. Therefore, he colluded with Tao Defeng from Tongzhou, Ni Binqi from Haimen, and Tao's mistress, Wang Xiuzhen, a guide at the Queen's Tourist Agency on Shantou Road. On the night of August 24th, Zhou Xiude lured his brother Xiuzheng to room 528 of the Da Zhonghua Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road. First, he plied Xiuzheng with wine and women to get him drunk. Then, taking advantage of his inebriated state, they strangled Xiuzheng with a rope, obtained the key to the Liyuan silver box from the deceased's person, and went to the brokerage, stealing US$580 in banknotes and checks for $2600 before fleeing. However, the matter was discovered by Liu Junjie, a Chinese detective, and detective Zhang Bingchun from the Lao Zha Gate Police Station. They apprehended the aforementioned individuals and a suspect, Zhu Qitai, and handed them over to the Special No. 1 Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiefen continued the trial in the Criminal Division. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated the case, prosecuting Zhou Xiude under Article 272 of the Criminal Law for the crime of killing a direct relative. Tao Defeng, Ni Baoqi, and Wang Xiuzhen were prosecuted under Article 271 of the same law for murder. As for Zhu Qitai, he was found to have no involvement, and a request was made for his release. After questioning by Judge Xiao, all the accused confessed to their crimes without denial. As a result, the court ordered a postponement for further verification, released Zhu Qitai, and remanded the others in custody.</p>
<h3>Training Boiler Operators to Reduce Public Housing Expenses</h3>
<p>The Industrial Section of the Public Works Department, in order to reduce the cost of hot water equipment in various public housing this winter, has suggested the following two measures to the owners of apartments located east of Jing'an Temple to the Bund: (1) According to the regulations of the Public Works Department, any boiler must have a formal inspection certificate. This certificate should be issued by a registered boiler inspection engineer. Apartment owners whose boilers have already undergone inspection this year should immediately request the inspection engineer to conduct an inspection and find ways to modify and improve them in order to save maintenance costs and maximize their efficiency. A list of approved registered inspection engineers can be obtained from the Industrial Section. (2) The Industrial Section plans to organize a training class for boiler operators, specifically for training boiler operators in apartments located in the aforementioned areas. The location is set at the Health Sub-Office at No. 340 Hankou Road, with classes scheduled to begin on October 21st, twice a week on Mondays and Thursdays, starting at 7:00 PM. A registered Chinese engineer will be the instructor, paying special attention to economical and safe methods of burning boilers. The course is expected to last five weeks. Apartment owners who wish to send their boiler operators to the class can register in writing with the Industrial Section from now on. The section is scheduled to handle the registration of trainees at No. 340 Hankou Road at 7:00 PM on the 14th of this month.</p>
<h3>Robbery at Heng De Li</h3>
<p>At 11:10 AM yesterday, a robber suddenly entered the Guangdong Road 288 branch of Heng De Li Watch &amp; Clock Shop in the Public Concession. He placed a round paper package on the counter. The shop assistant, seeing the package, suspected it contained a hand grenade and dared not resist. The robber then stole two watches and $78 in cash before fleeing. The shop assistant followed and reported the incident to the police, who apprehended the robber and recovered the stolen goods and the paper package. Upon opening it, it was found to contain a tin can.</p>
<h3>This Year's Epidemic Patients Far More Than Last Year</h3>
<p>According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency's inquiry with Mr. Deng Qingshan, the medical director of the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, the situation of this year's epidemic is as follows: From the start of free consultations at the hospital's epidemic department on July 1st to September 30th, the total number of outpatient visits was 35,028, the number of regular outpatient visits was 19,185, and the number of hospitalized epidemic patients was 2,581. As for true cholera, there were 328 cases. The total number of epidemic patients was 56,800, a figure far higher than last year. Currently, true cholera has not yet disappeared, with two to six patients seeking treatment every day. Therefore, residents should still be cautious about their health.</p>
<h3>Taxed Foreign Goods Remade Subject to Domestic Goods Tax</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, in order to rectify transit taxes, has stipulated that all goods manufactured or constructed domestically from taxed foreign raw materials, or foreign goods that have been adulterated or diluted after import, or whose original state has been altered by other means, shall be regarded as domestic goods. They shall be subject to transit tax uniformly upon re-export. Regarding the procedures for collecting transit tax on domestic goods: (1) In areas where customs offices are established, transit tax shall still be collected by the customs. (2) In provinces where customs offices were originally established, transit tax shall be collected by the freight inspection branch offices until the previously withdrawn checkpoints are restored. (3) In places where no customs checkpoints are established, transit tax shall be temporarily collected by the freight inspection office until customs offices are established.</p>
<h3>YWCA Appeals for Winter Clothing</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) has recently noted that, even before the height of winter, the number of people coming to seek discarded winter clothing has been increasing daily. However, their old stock is depleted, making it difficult to provide widespread assistance. Fearing that they will be unable to cope when the severe cold arrives, they are taking precautionary measures by appealing to all sectors of society for a large quantity of worn-out clothing, garments, quilts, and bedding. They hope that enthusiastic individuals will provide strong support and benefit the poor. If donations are made in cash, the YWCA can also purchase and prepare items on behalf of donors.</p>

<p>Life Sketch</p>
<h3>One Day of a Pay Raise</h3>
<p>— Bai Xi</p>
<p>As the hour hand on the clock approached five o'clock, people who had been sitting blankly in the office all day began to become active; the monotonous and unpleasant harmony of abacuses and typewriters stopped, replaced by noisy conversations and intermittent laughter.</p>
<p>"Old Zhang, I got a 20% bonus today, let's go have a good meal."</p>
<p>"Okay, Western food or Chinese food?"</p>
<p>"I think Western food is better, let's go for cheap eats, okay?"</p>
<p>"Good, with this rainy weather, the restaurants aren't doing business, so the side dishes must be especially authentic, maybe even extra."</p>
<p>"Old Wang, now that I'm full of energy, I can go dancing all night to get my fill!"</p>
<p>"What you're saying all costs money. Only I have a good way to eat and play without spending money. If you're happy, you can come with me."</p>
<p>"Hmm. Needless to say, you're going to the same old place, right? Sitting in a car, eating free food, who wouldn't be happy? But you have to be careful, a fifty-dollar allowance isn't enough for two slaps!"</p>
<p>"Old Qian, did you cover your Citibank short position?"</p>
<p>"No, I still have to watch the situation! Now that the Sino-American loan is established, the news is bad, so it's really good to short it!"</p>
<p>"The exchange rate is dropping, but things are getting more expensive, and foreign Xian rice has risen to more than seventy yuan a dan! Alas, what's the use of this 20% subsidy? It's really hard to live on Liangxiang chestnuts!"</p>
<p>"That's right, only people like Lao Shen in the manager's office can survive. They beg this and beg that, and finally get the foreigners to take pity and agree to give everyone a 20% raise, but what everyone gets is always five or six yuan, not enough to buy a dou of rice. Lao Shen doesn't spend any effort, but he gets a full seventy old yuan all at once, really has a way!"</p>
<p>"Do you know that the foreigners themselves got a 50% raise this month?"</p>
<p>"Things in the world are originally like this! Fairness is simply empty talk. People with rice hoard white rice to fatten the mice, watching the poor scratch their bellies in hunger!"</p>
<p>While everyone was gathered in a group talking and laughing, an ordinary clerk sitting in the corner of the office was still constantly flipping through the heavy ledger, circling in the pile of numbers. Although he didn't say anything, the conversations of others were heard in his ears, and chaotic thoughts surged in his mind. Just now, when others received a subsidy for a dan of rice, he was lucky enough to receive five yuan, which was only enough to buy five sheng of rice. He thought of the sad faces of his family suffering from hunger, and heavily took the five yuan, just like a long-awaited rain. He thought that he could sell five sheng of rice today, and everyone could eat porridge for two days; but then he thought that his wife had been groaning in bed for more than ten days, and he should take her to see a doctor and take medicine... Interrupting his thoughts were the sounds of the clock striking five o'clock. He raised his head and looked out the window. The rainstorm was raging, like thousands of troops galloping.</p>
<p>"Who wants to take a car, eight jiao a person, the group bus is very comfortable!"</p>
<p>He silently took off his shoes and socks in the corner, rolled up his trousers high, ready to fight the heavy rain!</p>
<h3>Small Statistics</h3>
<p>— Yuan Shan</p>
<p>According to the report of Xie Qi from the dance hall group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Widow Encouragement Committee: From August 1st to 30th, Class A dance halls raised 7,714 yuan; based on the calculation that this amount is one jiao for every yuan donated by widows, then its original amount is 77,140 yuan. Class B dance halls raised 1,863 yuan and 2.5 jiao; based on the calculation that this amount is five fen for every yuan donated by widows, then its original amount is 37,265 yuan. Adding the two amounts together, it totals 114,405 yuan; and this amount only refers to the two dance halls mentioned in the report. Combining all the income of all dance halls in Shanghai, it should be more than this amount. Disregarding the spirit and time consumed for this and not mentioning it, if we simply take this amount to do beneficial undertakings, it is certainly not difficult to definitely discover considerable achievements.</p>
<h3>Believe It or Not, If Rice Gets More Expensive</h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>If rice gets more expensive: Friends of the small salary class, their monthly income will not even be able to buy one liter of rice!</p>
<p>If rice gets more expensive: Shanghai landlords who sublet, not to mention they can't come up with another increase in rent like before; even if they are willing to give people a 50% discount on the original rent, I'm afraid no one would dare to accept it, because at this time everyone will be going to other places to find a way to make a living.</p>
<p>If rice gets more expensive: The wealthy and well-fed people of Shanghai will not have to use their property in relief efforts, but will have to use it entirely to protect their safety!</p>
<p>If rice gets more expensive: The court will have to issue such a notice: "From now on, in all criminal and civil cases, the food for prisoners during the period of imprisonment will be borne entirely by the plaintiff."</p>
<p>Hawthorne Case</p>
<h3>The Homecoming of the Dance Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Nine: Astonishing News</p>
<p>Yu Gantang replied: "Although I only saw the shape of his back, I definitely won't be mistaken. At that time, I became suspicious, but because that female classmate was beside me and it was raining heavily, it was inconvenient to stop the car. After I returned to the dormitory, the more I thought about it, the more suspicious I became, and I really couldn't sleep, so I came out of the dormitory again and went to Lilan's house, wanting to see if there had been any changes. When I arrived at her house, there was no light in the downstairs parlor, but the electric light in the dining room was still on, and Jinmei was also downstairs, not asleep. I knew something was wrong. When I was about to go in, Jinmei happened to walk out of the dining room, saw me, and waved to me. So I didn't go in."</p>
<p>Hawthorne nodded secretly, saying to himself, "This woman is really not easy to deal with. She may still hold the key to this secret case." He looked at me, and I nodded slightly as well, indicating that I had the same suspicions about this maid. He then continued to ask: "Did you talk to Jinmei at that time?"</p>
<p>The young man said: "No, she just waved to me from inside, and I got her signal, feeling that there must be something inconvenient to go in, so of course I didn't have the chance to talk to her. Then I returned to the dormitory, knowing clearly in my heart that something must have happened to Lilan, so I couldn't close my eyes. Early this morning, I rushed to my friend Song Zhaoqi's house in Changmingli, wanting to discuss it with him and then decide on a course of action. Zhaoqi hadn't gotten up yet, and after waiting for a long time, I was able to start a secret conversation with him. I told him the whole situation, but he advised me not to be involved in this matter. He guessed that something might become big, and it wasn't worth it for me to get involved. Thinking about it now, his advice was indeed very meaningful. But at the time, I just felt that he wasn't being a good friend and wasn't willing to help me. I argued with him for a long time, but there was no result. I was determined to go to Lilan's house again, but he tried his best to stop me, and also kept me at his place for breakfast. After thinking about it again and again, I felt that no matter what, I couldn't stand by. So I finally didn't listen to Zhaoqi's advice, and I went to Qingpu Road. When I arrived at her house, Lilan's body was just being carried out of the door. I did risk opening the quilt a little to take a look, and only then did I know that Lilan had really been beaten to death—had been beaten to death by Zhao Boxiong.</p>
<p>Yu Gantang paused slightly. The light of anger shot out from his eyes, stared at Hawthorne, and then shifted his gaze away, as if the following words were a little difficult to say. Hawthorne seemed to have seen through his thoughts, so he took over for him. Hawthorne said: "At that time, since you had already determined that Zhao Boxiong had beaten Lilan to death, you decided to avenge her; you went to see Song Zhaoqi again, insisting on borrowing a handgun from him: he still refused to agree, trying his best to dissuade you, and you even started arguing like you were going crazy, and insisted on borrowing it; he had no choice but to lend you an empty handgun without bullets—"</p>
<h3>The Cost of a Manuscript</h3>
<p>— Wanli</p>
<p>When each manuscript is submitted, the cost spent by the author is only slightly less than the royalties he receives. If you don’t believe it, let’s temporarily calculate the royalties we receive at an average of two yuan per thousand words (some are less than two yuan), then each thousand words costs at least three sheets of manuscript paper, averaging two fen per sheet, three sheets cost six fen (not counting drafts and mistakes): one envelope, three fen; four fen for postage; although other expenses such as ink and pen nibs are limited, they are ultimately expenses and damages. After the manuscript is sent out, every day you have to get up earlier to buy a newspaper to see if your article has been published. If it takes five days to a week to be published, the cost will be even greater. Fortunately, it is published, but the royalties can only be obtained next month, and when you go to collect the royalties, you have to spend some money on transportation. After spending so much time and energy, stretching your neck, you finally get these rewards, and whether it is published or not is still a question.</p>

<h3>Starting with Liang Hongyu</h3>
<p>— Tourist Reporter</p>
<p>The story of Liang Hongyu has long been passed down in history books. The deeds of this female national hero of a generation, brought to the screen at this time and place, I think it does contain extremely profound and positive meanings.</p>
<p>After "Mulan Joins the Army," the Shanghai film industry once mistakenly entered the wrong path of folk tale films. Among them, Jin Xing's "Li Xiangjun" naturally gave the audience a good impression. Now, Hua Xi's "Liang Hongyu" also gives us a new feeling. In terms of content, the material of "Liang Hongyu" is not only more intentional and profound than the aforementioned two films, but also feels very intimate and intuitive compared with the plays "Last Regret of the Ming Dynasty" and "Motherland."</p>
<p>We oppose yellow films that humiliate our own culture, but we also bravely give enthusiastic sympathy to films with positive content. Like "Liang Hongyu," it tells the audience—national interests are above all else. She, for the sake of her husband Han Shizhong's mistake in losing a military opportunity and letting the criminals escape, felt that reason should overcome love. She returned to the Song court alone to impeach her husband and request that he be punished as he deserved. Although that was hundreds of years ago, the spirit of Liang Hongyu is still worthy of inheritance, learning and promotion by the Chinese children of today.</p>
<p>I am happy to recommend films like "Liang Hongyu" to the audience.</p>
<h3>The Civet Cat Harms the Hibiscus Grass (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— New Voice</p>
<p>Bad Luck Ends and Good Fortune Comes Late in Life</p>
<p>The facts are as follows: Since the Civet Cat for Crown Prince was discontinued, the Da Chan stage has gradually declined, with each day worse than the last. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Furongcao resigned from the troupe and soon returned to her hometown in Beiping. Fortunately, she had mixed in Shanghai for several years and had quite a bit of money on hand, enough to live a hard life without worrying about food and clothing. At that time, the pear garden industry in the old capital was very developed, with dozens of male and female actor troupes. They found Furongcao's performance skills to be good, and everyone was vying to hire him. Furongcao adhered to realism, agreeing to whoever came. As a result, Furongcao's reputation suddenly expanded. It was also his fate to become successful. Whenever female actors came to Shanghai, they would desperately bring Furongcao with them. First, they could borrow some strength; second, he could temporarily explain plays that they didn't know. The pay started from 1,200 yuan and went all the way up to more than 3,000 yuan, which was considered quite a big deal. Later, whenever leading female roles came to Shanghai to perform, almost all of them couldn't do without him. A casual saying was, "Is Furongcao going?" Can you see how much Qi Ti Si is? Huangjin Changju, knowing that Furongcao was an indispensable red role for female roles, had the idea of ​​"long-term employment". First, they could save money on the plate; second, they could reduce the number of sentences; third, they could reduce the trouble of picking up and dropping off each time; fourth, they could limit the gradual increase in pay; (the pay for red roles is bound to increase every time,) this plan achieves four goals with one move, it's really thanks to them for thinking it up. Once the idea was decided, they began to discuss with Furongcao. He initially wanted 30,000 yuan, but after a lot of talking, it ended up with a long-term agreement of 20,000 yuan. From then on, the role of Furongcao became Huangjin's exclusive product. However, Furongcao also had his own plans. One, the female roles who came to Shanghai were not necessarily there every month, and even if they were, they might not necessarily be able to bring him along; second, he and his wife were people with hobbies, and smokers were most inconvenient for long-distance travel. Now, living in Shanghai for a long time can not only reduce a lot of trouble, but also avoid inspections by police officers at various wharves. For these reasons, when Huangjin's representative contacted him, he agreed very simply.</p>
<h3>Zhiyuan Drama Society Stages "Women's Apartment"</h3>
<p>— Lan Li</p>
<p>The Zhiyuan Drama Society is a powerful force among the student drama groups in Shanghai. It was established in Zhenru, and after "August 13th," the members revived it in the concession. It has performed nine public performances successively, like a wave, making its own contribution to pushing the waves of the entire drama movement. This time, they are preparing to hold their tenth public performance on the National Day of Double Tenth at the Russian Art Theater. The script for the public performance is the famous Mr. Yu Ling's "Women's Apartment", directed by Mr. Ye Min.</p>
<p>The script of "Women's Apartment" is almost known to everyone. In the past, quite a few drama troupes have performed this play. It has also been made into a movie, causing a sensation for a time. The actors of the Zhiyuan Drama Society, based on the serious and learning attitude that their students should have, coupled with the leadership of famous directors, will definitely capture the essence of every previous lesson" and crystallize higher art. I wish the Zhiyuan Drama Society an artistic victory on the Ren Shi Festival National Day!</p>

<p>Nanzi, the wife of Duke Ling of Wei, had an affair with Gongzi Chao of Song. Duke Ling welcomed Chao to Wei for her sake. When Confucius went to Wei, Nanzi, admiring his reputation, requested to see him. Confucius declined but could not avoid it, and was forced to meet her. Although they treated each other with propriety, Zilu was displeased, and Confucius, feeling ashamed, left Wei. Kuai Kui, angered by Nanzi's licentiousness, plotted to assassinate her but failed and fled to Jin.</p>

<h3>Calligraphy, Painting, and Chrysanthemum Exhibition by the Orphanage for Refugee Children</h3>
<p>— Organized</p>
<p>With Various Amusements to Add to the Entertainment</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Chairman of the Shanghai Relief and Education Center for Refugee Children, oversees more than 600 refugee children in the orphanage. There are no dedicated funds for their care, and all expenses rely on generous donations from all sectors of society. Now that the weather is getting colder, funds for winter clothing are still lacking. He convened people from all walks of life to discuss solutions. It was unanimously agreed that since Shanghai has become an isolated island, theaters and dance halls are thriving, but refined entertainment such as flower viewing and book reading is rarely seen. Why not take this opportunity to promote and refresh the senses? Therefore, a calligraphy, painting, and chrysanthemum exhibition was initiated. The venue has been borrowed from the Continental Swimming Pool on Jing'an Temple Road and has been approved. The date is set from the 24th of this month to the 3rd of November. Immediately, personnel were sent to collectors, calligraphers, painters, and chrysanthemum growers to contact them separately. Over a thousand pieces of calligraphy and paintings by famous figures, both ancient and modern, have been received, covering all dynasties from the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing. In terms of calligraphy, all styles of regular, cursive, clerical, and seal scripts are available. In terms of painting, there is no lack of figures, birds, flowers, landscapes, and so on. There are over six thousand pots of various chrysanthemums, with countless shapes and forms, supplemented by bonsai and fish birds. Various entertainers, famous amateurs, and celebrities are also invited to perform amusements to add to the entertainment. Admission tickets are priced at fifty cents each, and voucher tickets are divided into one yuan and five yuan denominations. These vouchers can be used to purchase calligraphy, paintings, and chrysanthemums inside, according to the standard legal tender, without discount. All proceeds from the tickets will be used to fund winter clothing for refugee children. This event brings together the essence of artistic endeavors to create a grand occasion, showcasing the exquisite beauty of chrysanthemums and the treasures of art. Investing in the purchase of tickets not only provides various artistic pleasures to admire, delighting the heart and mind, but also helps refugee children, allowing them to avoid the danger of freezing and starvation. It is a win-win situation, why not do it?</p>
