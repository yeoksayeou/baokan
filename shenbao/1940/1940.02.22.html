<h3>白崇禧報告　最近抗戰情勢　長期奮抗戰到底勝利時機日益接近</h3>
<p>桂林航訊　白主任崇禧、十九日下午二時、在某地招待桂文化界、報吿最近抗戰情勢、首說明國際形勢、於我極爲有利、敵國外交已愈趨孤立、次述我</p>
<p>最高戰略</p>
<p>爲持久戰、在持久戰中、勝利時機有三、一是自力更生的堅忍奮鬥、努力把敵人打走、一是消耗敵人的物力財力、促成敵人的崩潰、一是靜候國際間更有利的形勢的到來、以世界的力量、共同解決橫暴的敵人、上述三個</p>
<p>勝利時機</p>
<p>都是很有可能、且已從事實上表現出來、證實他的可能性、一天比一天接近、譬如從二期抗戰以來、敵在軍事上相繼的在山西、在鄂北、在湘北、在桂南、在粵北、遭到</p>
<p>慘重失敗</p>
<p>這說明敵人的軍事力量、已走到退化的過程、其次敵人的兵力、全國動員最高限度約爲七十五至八十個師團、但現已動員五十多僩師團、用到戰塲上的約四十六倘師團、各部隊的補充總在三十次以上、從前多係精壯的現役兵、現在多是老弱的後備役頂備役、可知敵兵員</p>
<p>補充困難</p>
<p>至於我們的防軍、不但愈戰愈多、而且隨着日子與戰鬬經騐、戰術上戰鬬上一天比一天的進步、愈戰愈强、經濟上敵三十多個月來所消耗的戰費、巳達二百萬萬日圓以上、敵國是先天不足的國家、平時財政已露出很大的破綻、長此消耗下去、眞不知如何了局、這在齋藤的質問中、已充分暴露日本國民的憂　與怨恨、再看敵國的公債、本年三月底止、將達二百四十萬萬日圓、到明春就要突破到</p>
<p>三百萬萬</p>
<p>圓、這驚人的數字、將逼使敵國經濟非走上總崩潰的慘境不止、因爲經濟的關係、牽連到軍事上、使敵人能佔不能守、能守不能久、最後必致一敗塗地、如弟一次世界大戰中的德國、父如拿破崙之人莫斯科、一樣再做次歷史的失敗的重演、外交上、最近國際形勢旣如上述、日本的孤立將有增無减、終有一天、各國拿出更有力的力量、共同　日</p>
<p>加以制裁</p>
<p>、但以上所說的、這些時機都不是短期間所能到來、所以「速勝」的心理、是很大的錯誤、唯有更堅忍的長期奮鬥、抗戰到底、然後才能爭取最後勝利的光榮、至於敵人在桂南和我們作戰、這是於我們非常有利的、我們很以敵人之不繼續深入爲可惜云云（廿一日電）</p>
<h3>黃大偉部偽軍　紛紛反正</h3>
<p>閩南前綫　由厦門西太武山登陸之日、自黃大偉部僞團長陳光銳·胡賴圃等、於十九日午各率所部共約二千餘、携來機關步槍等全部武裝反正後、日勢已呈瓦解、該處尚有偽軍官兵計千餘、多係鄂籍、武裝整齊、因日扣留黃大偉後、並向該偽軍嚴行壓迫、驅之前綫、憤恨已極、遂於二十日全體反正、刻與日在太武山附近、及港尾（厦門西南）一帶搏戰、（廿一日電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本的新南進政策</h3>
<p>日本小磯柘相隔昨在彼衆院預算會議中答覆關於「南方政策」的質問時，謂「擬將台灣及南洋委任統治地作基礎，對南華，泰國，海峽殖民地及荷屬印度羣島，作和平的經濟的發展方策」；同時外間又傳小磯於最近巡視南洋委任統治地後，已擬有種種擴張南洋經濟勢力的計劃。這類消息，本不足怎樣引人驚異；因為日人覬覦南洋，已有數十年的歷史，並且為舉世周知的事實；在日本對外侵略的企圖中，向來就有「滿蒙是日本的大陸生命綫」和「南洋是日本的海上生命錢」兩個相提並論的口號。現在她正在妄想獨霸亞洲，創造所謂東亞新秩序，則彼不能忘懷於經濟軍事各方面具有絕大意義的南洋，自是必然的趨勢；而且目前的國際局勢，和日本國內的政治情形，更有刺激實行南進野心的因素。</p>
<p>普通所稱的，包括泰國·安南·緬甸·馬　群島，婆羅州，東印度羣島，菲律賓羣島，面積約四百四十餘萬方公里，人口超過一億二千萬，各種物產豐富。而工業又並不發達；就經濟方面看來，這是一個廣大的商品市塲和原料的取給寳庫。如南洋最著名的煤油，橡皮，木材，棉花，米，鐵，錫，煤等，不僅為軍需工業的主要資源，而且為日常生活及普通一般工業上所必需。再就地勢言之，更見重要，有好些地方，都具有極大的軍事價値而成為亞洲大陸外圍上主妥據點。倘使和澳洲聯合，便可以控制太平洋的交通。換一方面觀察，歐洲各國必須把握南洋，纔能保全他們在亞洲的各種權益；美國要想維持太平洋上的利益，防止海外的威脅，也必須維持南洋的現狀；同樣，日本為着貫澈其東亞覇國，勢非劫持南洋不可。</p>
<p>日本為了實行南進政策，過去曾費去不少的精力。他與英美競爭海軍，非為對華，專為攫取南洋的準備。同時更以商品以及婦女的力量，和領有南洋各地的英法美荷等國，從事和平的鬥爭，結果頗得相當收穫。隨又以宗敎文化為工具，輸入政治勢力，在各地極力從事於各種煽動，以冀坐收漁人之利。此外在軍事上，日本也儘先樹立各種的基礎。日本在南洋所經營的漁業，決非純粹為着捕魚。從前還有人傳說過，日人曾在東婆羅州投下過五百萬盾以上的資本，所建造的乃是五百餘座沒有煤油生產的油井，附近並設有類似海空軍用的設備。由此可見日本對南洋的企圖，不以發展經濟勢力為限，而其最後是想把南洋併入自己的版圖。</p>
<p>自這次歐戰發生以來，日本雖因泥足深陷於中國，實際不復能在他處有所作為，但在野心勃勃的日本，却不能不想像，以為國際局勢給了它一個很有利的機會。英法等國對於遠東問題，自然有不少遷就日本的地方，於是更刺激了日本貪得無厭的野心。尤其是日本向來認為對南洋最易進攻的何屬東印度，荷蘭本國在歐戰的威脅下，已處於朝不保夕的苦境，對於南洋的殖民地，是否能盡力保護，目前雖然不能斷定，但至少亦必受有相當的影響。最近日本宣佈日荷公斷條約的無效，恐怕也就是懷有某種企圖、同時日本的本身環境，也在迫他走上南進政策這條路；因為今年一月美日商約的廢止以後，美國對於日本排斥美國在華權益的舉動，有隨時予以報復的可能，日本因此為了商品市塲和軍需原料，便不能不向南洋方面預謀補救的辦法。加之，現在的南洋，如安南緬旬，已成中國轉運商品的通路，這也非日人所樂意。於楚日本南進政策的實施，實際上就無異於侵略中國的側面攻擊。</p>
<p>小磯這次所說的，擬議進行和平的經濟的發展策，原來眞的和平的經濟的發展策，又何須以南洋委任統治地和台灣為根據地。上述兩地，並不是日本工商業的中心；而卡羅林羣島，大家都知道已被日本建設成為海軍的前哨。考其貫際，現在日本所謂和平的經濟的發展策，和她過去所謂「沒有領土野心」的口頭禪，具有同樣的意義，假如和平的發展策而無效，那就不能不借重武力了。總之，巧取豪奪，是雙管齊下的。以目前情形來說，日本的所謂和平的發展策，絕沒有成功的可能。第一，日本經過一一年多的戰爭，經濟上已到民窮財盡的地步，何來巨資發展南洋經濟勢力。第二，南洋各國的政府，對於過去日本經濟勢方的發展，久已感到厭惡和畏懼，今後又豈肯繼續放任，再增加自己的不安。第三，南洋的經濟和華僑的關係最為密切。近兩年來日本在南洋的經濟勢力，已因華僑的對日經濟絕交和抵貨而遭受巨大打擊，恢復已極困雜，發展史是侵談何容易。所以日本和平的經濟的發展，也許就是武力略的先聲。當然，現在發動武力，在日本也是不可能的，但是做足了武力侵略的猙獰姿勢，也許央法荷蘭竟然會接受他的這一套！</p>
<p>現在的南洋，實和「九一八」前的東北一樣，日本對她已有許多詳細的調查，深刻的研究，和精密的佈置。國際人士莫不知道南洋的危機，正在隨着時間的延續而逐漸擴大。在南洋具有重大權益的國家，今後要怎樣　應付日本和牛的與經濟的攻勢，這時已不能不予以鄭車顧慮了！這實在也就是日本對華侵略戰爭的一環啊！</p>

<p>英法輿論贊助張伯倫之論據</p>
<p>倫敦　張伯倫首相發表之演說、頃由政界人士加以評論云、政府對於「阿爾脫瑪克」號案採取堅決態度、已使一般人發生深刻印象、據消息靈通人士所知、英國政府匪特拒不作何讓步、且將採取必要措置、務使挪威國領海不復為德國所利用、至挪威國外長谷德所稱、各國政府所屬船舶、非中立國所得而檢查、此項論據碍難成立、誠者是則蘇聯一切船舶旣為政府所有、不論何國均不得加以檢查、寗有是理乎、關於挪威國擬將此、訴諸國聯會一節、則現在戰事期間、各中立國倘若違反國際、而不能尊重英國權利、英國即自　得以任便行動、俾其權利　有尊重、實乃當然之事、加之「阿爾脫瑪克」號所牽涉者、不止英國與挪威兩國、德國亦在其內、倘若德國拒不接受此種程序以及仲裁法庭之裁決、則挪威國仍屬徒勞無益、要之、挪威國內因實力荏弱或其他理由、未能追令德尊重其中立、以證英國則當採取必要措置、以保護本國利益、如派遣巡邏艦保護挪威國領海或保護英國商船、務使德國不致利用挪威國領海輸入各項違禁品、即其一例、則以德國在波羅的海冰凍之際、苟欲自挪威瑞典兩國輸入鐵礦砂、惟有利用挪威國領海故也（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>日圖霸佔對江渡　拖駁已被搗毀</h3>
<p>浦東陸家渡渡口、昨晨聞放後、有日商華光輪渡公司開航對江法租界魚行碼頭拖船、希圖營業牟利、詎原有東昌路對江民渡、（亦靠魚行碼頭）因恐生計被奪、集衆將華光拖駁小輪一艘、已於昨日駛返浦東時、被二百餘划子夫搗毀甚重、艙面坡璃窗完全擊碎、烟囱上半被敲落、木殼船身戮有無數篙子筒、雖未下沉、但非加大修、不能行駛、故令日無法復航、據悉日方雖極重視此案、但鑒於划船帮之團結一致、為生計關係、以性命相搏、並非故意之犯罪行為、故亦無從着手加以壓迫、</p>
<h3>新警隊組織　全歸偽府控制　非屬於公共租界警務處大部份警員由偽方指派</h3>
<p>大陸報云、工部局與「上海市府」上星期五日簽訂協定、規定成立在界外馬路區其有唯一權力之「特別警察隊」、協定評則、將由公共租界警務處長包文少校與「市警局長」盧英商定之警察隊隊員約在一千二百人以上、此數雖似龐大、但聞「特別警察隊」不僅將在界外馬路上行使職權、即馬路間之地區、亦將在該隊官轄下、又出「特別警察隊」大多數隊員、均係「市府」指派之候選人員、其從工部局指派之候選人員中派出者、不出該隊之什一、而高級警員亦將包括在內、「市長」傳筱菴將於本週抄開始發動會議、連續討論數種極重要問題、</p>
<p>經費均由偽府擔任</p>
<p>新「警隊」雖係完全獨立之機關、但就事實而論、將成「市警局」之一部份、而非公共租界警務處之部份、故該隊經費、大半將由「市府」供給、但財政問題不致山警務首領加以討論而將由工部局與「市府」分別辦理、衆認此點乃談判越界築路區收捐問題中之一節、</p>
<p>範圍機構均待商討</p>
<p>警務首領所將討論者、為新警隊之範圍與機構、總辦公處之地點、以及委派執行人員諸事、至於在外國人有龐大財產區之特別警署問題、亦將加以討論、此項問題在原由上已經臨時協定規定、有人主張該警署設於愚　路與大西路西部、</p>
<p>警員待遇亦須研究</p>
<p>另一問題亦將加以討即從警務處調入新警隊之警員待遇是、此等警員、調入新警隊後、當然將喪失其在工部局服務時所享利益、故予以適當之償補問題、亦當加以磋商、聞彼等入新警隊後之待遇、將不輸於工部局給予彼等者、按照目前計劃、「特別警察」將不僅專管越界築路本身、目將管轄西迄虹橋路之馬路間一切地區、</p>

<p>把持現貨同業憤慨</p>
<p>煤球自上海市商會機制煤球業公會會同公告實行平價後、用戶為之寬慰、惟事實則有不然、用戶向柴炭行或煤球號購買煤球、輒遭藉口無貨拒絕、　勞往返、而直接向各煤球廠購買、又感粥少佾多、反演成有價無貨之狀態、深為關心民生者所寒心、茲悉各公團方面、對此正商討辦法、務使對把持現貨者、嚴予糾正、惟悉本市薩坡賽路某煤球附設煤球廠、規模宏大、為煤球業之巨擘、去年獲利運二百餘萬、最近自各廠實行平售後、該廠獨不願虧蝕、故日來諉稱機件損壞、竟停止製造煤球、一面將煤球原料以每噸美金十元之高價、大量售與某方、故已引起同業間之憤慨、將請公會予以議處、</p>

<p>侵佔區煤斤遭壟斷</p>
<p>大陸報云、聞諸可靠方面、日當局今在租界外之侵佔區內、襲斷煤斤、旨在保障日軍有充量之燃料供給、而對日商公司企圖以謀斤售予外人商行者、即用嚴格手段對付、此等事實、已於本週內證實、蓋星期一日、日當局會阻止將價値七萬元之</p>
<p>頭等硬煤</p>
<p>三百噸、交予法租界內某華商公司也、據私人方面查悉、三井物產會社係將該三百噸煤斤、售予附屬之某日商公司、以供給日方統制之華方鐵路應用、詎該附屬公司不從當局之令、而將該批煤斤轉售入法租界、</p>
<p>日憲兵隊</p>
<p>聞訊、即加限止、但此等煤斤業已分號六船、載抵愛多亞路口法租界外灘起岸、日方已無權强將煤斤取回、聞日法兵即告租界外籟警官謂、該批謀斤、係自三井物產會社竊取者、警務處當即扣留載煤船六艘、至日憲兵旋稱將煤一</p>
<p>運回三井</p>
<p>物產會社始已、聞界外區域煤號、已接命令、先將其煤斤供給日艦海軍當局、如有剩餘、則供給日商工廠、最後始能供給外人商號、今三井物產會社碼頭、積煤如山、至少高達三十呎、大半係供日當局應用、上海若干謀商、相信日方發令統制煤斤、當然事屬可能、惟煤礦多在日方侵佔區、故詳細事實、猶未可知云云、但據煤業中人云、租界用煤、採自外洋、日方壟斷、影響殊尠、</p>
<h3>汽車裁縫舖失火　死傷共十四人　西區兩處大火燬一千餘間</h3>

<h3>國醫朱南山故後　兩子大興訟端　鶴皇控訴小南侵佔世風道德不可瀹亡</h3>
<p>國醫南通人朱小用朱鶴臯、同為已故名醫朱南山之子、其診所設於愛文義路長沙路口九十六號自建之住宅內、平日朱氏昆仲診金所得、平均分配、而由掛號海鬥人沈文斗兼任可賬之職、並有契約互資信守、不料近來朱氏昆仲之間、忽生裂痕、民刑訴訟、跡踪而起、同胞手足、</p>
<p>分庭對薄</p>
<p>其起因不外乎萬惡之金錢間題、先是朱鶴臯在特一院民庭為查賬問題、對其長兄小南提起訴訟、業經審理多次、尙未終結、不料一波未平、一波又起、朱鶴臯以其司賬沈文斗·朱小南·有共同侵占徐懋棠所付之診金四百零五元、除小南應得之半數外、其餘二百零二元五角、則被侵吞、乃由於去年廢歷大除夕、向新閘捕房報告、由華探目楊斐章往將沈先行拘獲、並將朱小南</p>
<p>飭傳到案</p>
<p>蕭推事訊供之下、以此種案件、係屬告訴乃論者、原被兩造、旣屬同胞手足、殊不宜因細微而涉訟公庭、乃諭令出外試行和解、沈文斗准交二百元保候訊在案、但在改期中、朱氏昆仲因意氣極深、致和解不成、昨晨又經蕭推事升座刑二庭集訊、首向朱鶴臯訊問本案是否仍須進行、據答</p>
<p>定欲告訴</p>
<p>現控沈文斗背信、朱小南侵占、除謂按律治罪外、尙須附帶民訴、請求判令兩被告共同運帶負責賠償二百〇二元五角、詰之　　斗、仍稱徐戀棠之診金、不　眾收到、負賠償之責、質之朱小南供稱、徐之診金、本為五百五十五元、經中匯銀行協理楊字生向舍弟鶴臯情商議減、故付四百零五元、於去年四月六號徐飭人送來、</p>
<p>由我收下</p>
<p>當時曾向舍弟聲明、款以我個人名義存於大亞銀行、本應平均分配、因去歲杜月笙氏曾餽送金香烟盒一只、金表一只、被鶴臯取去、並未分派、故亦將此款扣留、以便於年終結賬時再核、對沈文斗毫無關係云云、訊至此業已明瞭、論令開始辯論、先由捕房律師張天蔭及原告律師起而陳述請求辦法、並附帶民訴、末由被告朱小南之律師洪士豪辯稱、自朱</p>
<p>南山故後</p>
<p>小南因屬長子、故為家長、契約內訂明家長可以動用公款、今原告僅為二百餘元之小數、竟致以刑事涉訟、查其民庭起訴者、其標的為一萬元、所交公費已達八百元、今竟不顧同胞手足、欲使長兄限入縲號、案情內容、姑且不論、世風道德、不可瀹亡、此點應請注意、庭諭本案　論終結、被告等退候二十八號宣判、</p>

<h3>美籃球名敎練　談近代籃球戰術　中學有保存中圈跳球必要不能守衛之球隊決無勝望</h3>
<p>（紐約通訊）美國著名籃球老敎練安特列斯氏、安任雪拉克期籃球隊敎練已十六年、對近代籃球戰、發表意見二點如下、現代籃球戰、自中圈跳球取消後、其速度之增加、有如看乒乓比賽不停的滿塲來往、看固好看、但對少年籃球員之體力，則大有妨害、在大學球員似無損害、因其發育更為完全也、故據安氏觀察、在最近將來、籃球規則勢必各立、在中學籃球賽、中圈跳球、實有保存之價値、以减低其速度也、</p>
<p>安氏更稱在今日廢除中圈跳球後之籃球戰術中、訓練上之最困難點、為使其有守衛力量、往日比賽中、敎練對其球隊能使對方不超過五十分、已儀極幸運矣、蓋新球術已造成球員集中訓練於射籃、無論遠近、單手或雙手、大學新生之籃球員、皆從事於射籃練習、而極不注意於守衛、吾人必須告之曰、無論本隊能得分多少、而不能守衛者、決不能得勝一比賽也、</p>

<h3>金融　港方繼續　拋塞外匯</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌悉無上落、英美匯暗市、祇半天行市、情况呆滯、中途曾略硬化、惟結果與隔昨收盤、不分榮辱、至晨開英金稍告帶緊、為四辦士一七一八七五、美匯則仍為六元八七五、嗣以外行如有利·華義等雖互相扒吸、但港電前來塞出、且匯豐亦有賣胃、再加沙遜多頭亦略有出籠、故市勢反略鬆硬、斯時英金達四辦士二〇三一二五、美匯至六元九〇六二五、旋以進口商需要結納、並猶太商亦有扒進、故市勢遂見回平、午刻買賣淸淡、遂於平定狀態下、即告收盤、英金四辦士一八七五、美匯六元八七五、與上日相埒、三月期貨趨勢與現貨美匯稍形軋攏、計相差〇九三七五、英金則仍距離〇二五、</p>
<p>市象頗為平定</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近期縮一二五、遠期跌〇六一五、紐約銀悄仍平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美·滬·法等各滙俱平、美對英·對法亦均平定、對滬小五分、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士一七一八七五、美匯六元八七五、較之前收、英緊〇一五六二五、美則無榮辱、開後有利·華義雖來扒吸、但幸港電前來供塞、且加滙豐亦有賣意、故市面頗形穩定、計港電塞予有利·麥加利現貨英金四辦士一八七五、及滙豐賣予華義現貨美滙六元八七五、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀乎衡稅揭曉跌一分、此後西商沙遜突來出籠、故市勢略形走鬆、計賣予外行三月份美匯六元八一二五、斯時現貨價硬至四辦士二〇三一二五、及六元九〇六二五、旋以猶太商稍來扒進、且洋行界略有零星結款、故情况即告回平、計洋行購納某行現貨美滙六元八七五、及猶太商結進外行三月份英金四辦士一二五、午刻狀態更靜、迄至收盤無變、英金仍四辦士一八七五、美滙亦仍為六元八七五、本月份英金四辦士一七一八七五、美滙與現貨同價、下月期英金四辦士一二五、美滙六元七八一二五、結果現貨與上日均無軒輊、期貨英金亦未分榮辱、美匯則略長〇三一二五、午後週三無市、</p>
<p>香港英美無變</p>
<p>香港二十一日電、今晨匯市開盤平穩、英美日各匯、仍無榮辱、申匯現貨初開升五元、為三百五十五元、嗣於十時二十分回降一元、為三百五十四元、十一時三十分平穩無上落、午收市面穩定、巾匯現貨再降半元、為三白五十三元半、下午週三無市、</p>
<p>天津申匯續降</p>
<p>天津二十一日電、今晨匯市開盤告平、英美匯現貨均無上落、申匯續降一元半、為一百十元零五角、「聯鈔」暗盤亦續昂七元、為一百零八元、</p>
<h3>浮多出籠　金市又挫</h3>
<p>昨現金烚赤暗盤、復見回降、雖中途香港帮曾來扒進、但為數有限、良以條子及貨物有不能向銀行做押款之傳說、賣者頗稱擁擠、故結果遂跌落四十元、至晨開尙平、仍為四千八百三十元、嗣以滙市略硬、銀樓帮首肯塞出、某銀號力賣獵後、遂即退達四千八百元關口、惟港帮及證劵帮搜買、會被拉起二十元、但此後港帮買意中止再以散戶多頭復來出籠、故頭寸倍形充裕、遂降至四千七百八十元低價、旋乃某金號乘賤撈進、且斯時外滙已報回平、故再回高至四千八百十八元、卒以銀樓帮及散戶重來傾吐、加之證劵帮亦轉買為賞、收盤又退至四千七百八十五元、午後初開平定、後以某銀號忽來復進、曾拉起二十元、奈證券帮等塞出、復退至四千七百九十元收盤、全天交易稍淸、約二千三百兩光景、銀樓飾金未更、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤跌四十元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）初開平穩、一首由證券帮進錢兌業十兩、仍為四千八百三十元、少頃外滙略形硬化、銀樓帮首來塞出、某銀號亦跟賣繼後、且買者寥寥、價遂猛撳三十元、銀樓帮互做二十兩、為四千八百元、嗣以港帮突委某銀樓代買同時證券帮亦代客戶撈入、回起二十元、證券帮進現金號五十兩、為四千八百二十元、此後港帮中止活動、且加某銀號復來猛塞、加之錢兌業亦代客戶出籠、復暴跌四十元、破入四千八百元關內、錢兌業出金號二十兩、為四千七百八十元、旋乃某金號忽代本帮撈進、且滙市已報回平、重又回高三十八元、某金號進錢兌業三十兩、為四千八百十八元、不意午刻再起賣風、某銀號續來力售、更以銀樓帮與證劵帮等亦賣、雖某現金號乘機吸納、但頭寸終感不敵、竟冉降落三十三元、錢兌業出銀樓帮及余號共五十兩，為四千七百八十五元作午收價、午後初開頗平、金號進錢兌業二十兩、仍為四千七百八十五元、嗣以某銀號忽來復進若干、同時某錢兌業亦有撈入、遂抬起二十元、錢兌業互做三十兩、為四千八百〇五元、入後證券幫稍來吐出、且錢兌業亦有賣胃、遂又降小十五元，錢兌業出證券帮廿兩、為四千七百九十元作晚收價、結果比上日回跌四十元、全天五十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤高數元、收進减低二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金尚無上落</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、終日未動、大同行仍縣四百八十五元、新同行與上價相同、收進約均减低十五元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣轉趨穩定</h3>
<p>昨日英美金鎊、需要趨稀、市價稍軟、英美金票供求未盛、市價穩定、上午英金票五十三元五角、美金票為十四元四角二分、與前晚無榮辱、午後同業心思稍堅、市價微升、晚市英金票升為五十三元六角、美金票偽十四元四角三分、杳港票法郎票等、供求稀少、市價未更、日金票穩定、晚市仍為一元二角九分、朝鮮票稍回昂、晚市為一元零五分、昨日市價英美金鎊俱降一元、英金票升一角、美金票升一分、其他各幣俱未更動、</p>
<h3>證券　多空旗鼓相當壁壘愈築愈高　會德豐股出百元</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤昨日市况、人心依然恍惚、但原來多空大小各戶、雙方仍於一貫宗旨、互相加碼、璧壘愈築愈高、多方目標、在中美新借款之成立、空方則偏重於政治方面、故前途在不久將來、當有較大之變化、昨日半日交易、買賣兩方之陣錢、大致與隔日相同、如信聯繼續買進、中以信孚比較為熱烈、同康同順及久豐一貫賣出、中以同康比較為湧、餘如仁昌及二十號之買進、及卅八號四十一號之賣出、亦復旗鼓相當、故布價倐升倏降、隨供求為升沉、但其高低差價、亦祗一二角而已、結果機續軋漲五分一角至二角、成交數約四十萬元左右、茲列簡表於後、</p>
<p>類別　最高　最低　收盤　比前日</p>
<p>統甲五七·四〇　五七·三〇五七·四〇漲〇·一〇</p>
<p>統乙五〇·六〇　五〇·五五五〇·六〇又〇·二〇</p>

<p>統戊四八·五〇　四七·九〇四八·〇五又〇·二〇</p>
<p>股票交易、成交中一信託公司股四十股、價為　元二角五分、</p>
<p>衆業公所股市、仍極活潑、趨勢參差不定、會德豐股因展望良佳而漲、價自九十七元半始以迄一百零四元買進收盤、騰達之速、卓越餘股、橡皮股甚穩定、大衆對於各股、並無急切購求之象、於以見多方所持籌碼、似已充盈逾量也、</p>
<p>倫敦二十日電今日中國外債暨英商遠東各公司股票掛牌行市、均告平穩、行情概無變動、</p>
<h3>紗花　原料高昂　紗價轉堅</h3>
<p>上月期貨成交漸增</p>
<p>紗市續堅、漲風漸起、實因廠方原料高昂、各項開繳增加、所以對於開紗一層、依然檳持不賣、籌碼比轉缺乏、同時一般經濟寬紓之戶、逢低時復來吸收、不過實需交易、仍屬遲滯不振、因之漲力未强也、</p>
<p>現紗晨盤、因上日午後已轉漲、開出人心續佳、塲中買氣吒盛、二十支雙馬開價為八百五十二元、漲十六七元、旋聞外滙稍長、黃金略挫、形勢緩和、浮多吐出、一部份雙馬回至八百四十三元、詛價格一疲、榻便宜貨者又來活動、再升四五兀、收盤價為八百四十七元、三月期貨成交漸漸增多、查半日間成交統計二千七百五十包、行情二十支雙馬漲十二元、今日有棉紗一百九十件運香港、二百二十件運廣州灣、三十五件運海口、茲將各幫口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>同行二、四五五　香港五〇</p>
<p>內地二四五　統計二、七五〇</p>
<h3>廠商開始採棉　市價愈俏</h3>
<p>本棉交易又形熱鬧、廠方中外各廠漸見活動採辦、故市價愈形俏利、至於同業鑒於外匯不能鬆懈、手中之貨非但不願脫售、反見拖進、於是棉市較紗價高昂尤多、實則存底單薄之故也、蘇北來源、到通花僅二百六十九包、茲將現棉成交情形錄左、</p>
<p>火打包　一九五·五〇同行進　一六二件</p>
<p>辛特　一七〇·〇〇　又　一五〇件</p>
<p>火打包　一九六·五〇　又　二四四件</p>

<p>通州花　二〇一·〇〇　又　七〇〇包</p>
<p>二〇三·〇〇</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐約棉市、農初先因利物浦來電報告下落、市况因之軟疲、跌落四五磅音、後因華爾街之在市購買、及一部份空頭抵補、結果收盤雖回好三五磅音、然較之上日價格無甚軒輊也、印度棉市平平、埃及跌十餘磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、各方殊為淸淡、然售價方面俱不願稍鬆也、廠方則購意淡薄、日方廠商亦未聞有大量交易之做開也、茲將昨日棉市以美匯六元八七五折合送廠價如下、</p>

<p>四十二支　又　下級二六三·〇〇</p>
<h3>糧食　米市善造謠　洋米劇漲</h3>
<p>米市連朝步步下降、前市突又猛瀉二元、若一號西貢已跌至四十七兀五角、昨則開手尙見續降、無如一般囤戶見市面猛落、認為有機可乘、突又出其魔手、從事操縱、一方散佈空氣、流言海防止運之說、一方先施拉進、客販受其愚弄、遂均懷貨居奇、喊聲迭起、一時市面突飛猛騰、若一號西貢會喊達五十元零五角、以前市收盤相較、竟漲三元之巨、然事實難違、本鄉店舖實胃不暢、終覺月缺難圓、不易持久、况囤戶素抱心思作用、旣見市面造成高峯、又聞匯水放長、即將獲利貨趁昂推出、所以後市無非回籠互相授受、漲風豈能久站、遂步同低、然結果終以早市一轟過頭、回風難抗、各貨收盤又較前市增上二元左右、適將前跌之數、恢復原狀、計一號西貢、收盤為四十九元半、四十九元二角、二號四十八元三角、次至四十七元七角、火絞四十八元半、四十八元、小紋定貨（二百二十四磅計算）五十七元、五十六元半、大紋高貨四十五元、次至四十三元、東京砶尖四十五元半、次至四十四元三角、混合碎三十七元半、至三十六元八角、糯米國洋兩貨相隨跟升元許、厚薄粳國米傳聞虹口來源、昨無轉出、塲外暗盤復烈、亦暗漲二元之巨、崑錫等高粳售五十四五元、特別薄稱五十二元、次至五十一元云云、總之此種米價暴漲、米業責無旁貸、如麵粉普遍平售、人民載道、額手稱慶、燃料煤球亦跟踪平價、只有米業專會口說、不見實行、處處欺人、事事橾縱、買定好米、付以次米、磅過之後、少去分量、又如米店關門、為自衛不顧大衆、無如對於米商之刁惡陰很、迄無辦法、聽其自然、不可救藥、官傳繼續平糶、杯水輿薪、猶月明點燈、空有其美、醃鯉魚放生、死活不知也、故以米業較之麵粉業、還以粉業為賢明也、又悉、海防禁米出境之說、亦與滬市影響小多、且日內尙有大批途貨可到人心趨下、價又回小近元、二號西貢回籠原包自五十七元小至五十六元三角、二號暹邏自五十六元八角小至五十六元三角、小較自五十七兀小至五十六元、統市開出九百噸、現米四千包、</p>
<h3>粉麥平定</h3>
<p>麵粉　自逐日由廠家供給七千五百包平賣後、每經過辦理平價麵粉之店家、買客綿亘數十家門脾之長、胸背相疊、先到者仍有買不到粉、遲到者或捷足先登、此中情况、或為一般人所不及明、實則亦不難索解、此在辦理與糾察者是否為大衆利益着想也、最不幸者守候竟日置不到粉、還遭鞭箠、是亦貧民不平之處也、市上回籠貨如紅藍車棧單略有開出、價仍為十四元五角、其他各貨、均呈擯局、聞平賣事件、因實惠米能及於一般平民、刻正在討論採取零售制度云、</p>
<p>小麥　交易亦告岑寂、自前日開跌半元外、購方續思抑小、而貨方則以現麥存到兩薄、尙擬扳守待機、故全日間僅開蘇州麥一車、價為二十七元原盤、其他交易暫居擯局、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆街銷尚盛</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆市况、在上週內之瘋在漲風、已告絕跡、大局雖轉平定、但一般囤胃尙在搜羅、故交易尙盛、除本街成交蕪湖豆一百五十包、價為廿八元四角至六角、父桑園豆三十包、價為二十五元五角外、由囤戶買去南京豆一千二百餘包、價自二十四元至二十五元五角、又崇明沙黃一百餘包、價為二十八元三角、又今日有豆子一萬二千三百八十包、又有豆油四百聽、生油四百聽、俱運香港、</p>
<h3>絲茶　洋莊絲銷呆滯</h3>
<p>昨日橫濱絲銷又復下回、現貨跌七十元、遠期跌二十三元、紐約近期跌一角二分、遠期跌一角、本埠洋銷、乃又停頓、惟用戶絲市則較生動、白廠五千元及輯里特上售開三千二百元、維有小額成交、目售盤較洋行吃價高出近百元、粗絲印銷、昨亦呆滯云、二十二日有茶葉七十五件運往香港、</p>
<h3>煤炭　烟煤屑狂抬</h3>
<p>烟煤屑各貨、近日生意、極大鬧熱、工廠老虎灶浴室各方均有需要、始終不衰、結市上存底薄弱、搪客又從中在抬、行情上落、相差懸殊、計做印度屑每噸二百八十元、開平屑二百四十五元、基隆屑二百三十元、以致用戶昨舌、又不勝負担之苦、而白煤層如鴻基等貨、則反遜色、推木思源、實因物稀為貴、來源不多之故、</p>
<h3>糖市　國糖與洋糖微升</h3>
<p>荷蘭粗砂白又開出三月分期貨二千包、由大昌公司開出、價為荷幣六·二五、Ｏ.Ｉ.Ｆ＆Ｉ.Ｃ·例、公會劃盤稍見回升、粗砂升五角、二四粗白本棧六十二元五角、外棧新貨六十二元七角至五角、老貨六十二元、轉口貨仍四十九元、太古Ｂ嘜西貨六十三元五角、東棧貨六十二元二角、ＣＷ六十二元、ＸＣ與ＤＹ六十一元、ＨＸ嘜六十元〇七角、Ｈ嘜車赤西棧貨四十五兀五角、束棧貨四十五兀、荷赤ＭＰ嘜四十八元、ＷＡ四十七元五角、雪自六十二元、本冰七十四元五角、晶明冰七十六元、國糖又開出條靑數十箱、價為三十九元二角、比前升二角、</p>
<h3>五金　新鉛絲　連日津銷旺盛</h3>
<p>新鉛絲銷路向以天津帮為最廣、本街及其他客帮、祗抵其半、近日津帮連購共達千數白担之譜、標準乃扶搖直上、如八號至十六號、每擔沾七十五元、十六號至二十號、每担售九十元、二十一號至二十五號、則須一百〇五元左右云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布存貨　滿坑滿谷</h3>
<p>布市趨勢穩定、奧港溫臺津秦各幫及本市實銷稍增、廠方開價步漲、故市上存貨雖有滿抗滿谷之慨、市般仍支持有力、昨各價平平、手貨現墊價每疋鬆動、三角之譜、本街成交白地印花布·漂布·府綢·嗶嘰·坯布·粗布三百餘件、夸港帮辦細布·細斜·漂布·印花布一百餘件、浙閩帮辦綸昌·怡和等廠粗布·細布·色布·衣布·一百數十件、北帮辦組布、府綢·藍布近百箱、本街鬥市及服裝料貨批發交易頗盛、</p>
<p>東布昨本街染銷及同業心思交易、依然熱鬧、白貨細布以中擋喇叭實需較盛、每疋續漲二角半、高檔龍頭細布市塲乍進乍出、數額尤鉅、晨開二十六元五角半、一度降至二十六元、後市收盤、又升漲至念六元五角、下月份期須二十七元五角、而大戶尙不肯出賣，四君子兀嗶嘰現貨每碼七角七分七五、市氣殊堅、</p>
<p>出口、二十二日運海口四十四件、又五十四件、運廣州灣三百四十五件、運香港、三百二十八件運海防、</p>
<h3>呢絨奇昂</h3>
<p>毛織物羢嗶嘰、新近進口甚稀、申地紡織品、亦因原料步漲運輸困難關係出品减少、致目前躉批交易殊寡、法蘭羢售價特別昂貴、市貨更形缺乏、斜花底每碼竟開售至二十六七元、板四底二十元仁立貨開十六七元、怡和派力司開沽十元〇五角、利興派力可十二元、正綸頭號黑炭襯四元、副號二元五角、寅豐頭號法西襯八角、二號七角、大同造絲花洋布一元八角、</p>
<h3>海味　國產海蜓久斷</h3>
<p>劣貨充斥於市</p>
<p>烟台海蜓、僅去秋有到、如細條售過八十三四元、惟以產量有限、來源久斷、於是劣貨大量傾銷、近來史見充斥於市、查箱貨紙包二打裝者、亦為細條、須售一百五六十元、較之舊市、國貨須增貴一倍云、</p>

<p>今日的上海，儼然已經成為生活的戰塲了。街頭巷尾，橫屍遍地，這些是在生活的鬥爭中陣亡了的「將士」；有些人因為物價的高漲和生活的壓迫而自殺了，這些是人間的逃卒：還有許多嗷嗷待哺飢號寒的男婦老幼，亟待救擠，這些人可說是我們的傷兵；而發饅頭施粥的慈善機關，就是我們的救護隊。</p>
<p>在這生活的戰爭中，我們是在跟誰打仗呢？我們是不是永遠要這樣地一直打下去，直到我們的子子孫孫呢？</p>
<p>飛漲的物價並不是我們的眞敵人，投機的奸商也還不是我們的眞敵人。我們的眞敵人，是不合理的社會制度。這個畸形的社會制度，是由我們糊塗的祖宗傳授給我們的，民不但糊塗地把它接受下來，而且似乎也要糊塗地傳授給我們的子孫了。</p>
<p>這個不合理的社會制度是由你跟我和他所造成的，是我們每個人所應該負責的。</p>
<p>我們要安定物價　要叫每個人能够享受做人的權利與合理的生活，我們　得從改良我們的社會制度着手。</p>
<p>施賑平糶，　　　水車薪；剴切勸告，猶如對牛彈琴；製裁了一個奸商　新的奸商還是要源源而來的。這些雖然都　是辦法，可　　　不是永久的根本辦法。</p>

<h3>勇壯活潑的芬蘭女性</h3>
<p>— 史弢</p>
<p>以一小國芬萊蘭抗拒蘇聯的進攻，這似乎是件不可能的事，然而英勇的芬人終於在幹這艱鉅的工作了，到現在為止，芬蘭的軍隊還是堅固　死守着她的國境綫，獲得了全世界人士廣大的同情，這一方面固然是前綫戰士努力作戰的報酬，但戰後芬蘭女子的活躍也是存在着不可湮滅的功績。</p>
<p>芬蘭有怎麼樣的女性？古羅馬時代的歷史家泰西泰斯在他的著書「甘爾馬爾尼亞」中已經這樣說過：「波羅的海之北有個芬尼亞小國（即今之芬蘭）那裏的人民度着與强烈的自然鬥爭的生活，尤其是女性們非常勇壯活潑，她們和男子一同出去狩獵的時候，將樹枝揷在地上，就把孩子安放在樹枝的丫叉間，得到的烏默男女平分，一切也都男女平等的！」芬蘭的女性不僅是勇壯活潑，而且有高深的敎養，在歐洲最早獲得婦女參政權的就是一九〇七年帝俄支配下的芬蘭，現在全國七千名的大學生中，女性佔三千六百名，女性敎育程度之高，當可想見了，因此女子職業在芬蘭社會裏也是十分普遍，從議員，審判官，銀行行員，醫生，物理學者等一直到電車賣票，理髮匠，都有女性的份兒。</p>
<p>職業上，敎育上，政治上，芬蘭是男女平等的，所以軍事上她們也是不能例外得和男子分負重任，由於弟一次世界大戰所產生的婦人義勇軍是一個强度組織化的婦女團體，牠的使命是補助國防軍的不足，在戰時的後方服務；在創立這團體的一七一九年，牠的團員不過二三萬，現在則已有十萬了，這團體並不是强制的要人加入，其中有大學生，有商店職員，有家庭的主婦，誰都目願的提供各自特別的技能和時間，例如某大學女生，她祇有星期一五二日的夜裏有空閒，於是她就在這時間為婦人義勇軍工作，入團必先宣誓，然後得穿鼠色的制服，再各各分配到傷兵救護班，衣服班，資金班，敎育班，宣傳班等處，班長的命令一下，她們便一絲不亂地開始活動，芬蘭軍隊的不易敗北，得益於這種「補助軍」是很顯然的。</p>
<p>芬蘭女性不僅是活潑勇壯，而且世界恐怕再沒有比芬蘭更嗜愛音樂的女性了。任何村莊裏都有唱歌隊，都市中的商店職員，電話接綫生等祇要她們有閒嘴裏就漏出歌曲來了。芬蘭也是產生世界長跑健將的國家，所以她們對於體育也有濃郁的趣味，傍晚時分有一羣羣少女穿了希臘式的運動衣，在郊外的運觔塲裏，跟着動人的音樂行行，陶醉在希臘式的舞蹈中。</p>
<p>芬蘭沒有不參加「婦人義勇」軍的女性，也沒有不加入音樂部或是運動俱樂部的女性。</p>

<h3>十四世達賴卽位</h3>
<p>— 李紹忠</p>
<p>今日，（二月二十二日）為西藏第十四倫達賴喇嘛坐床大典日期。這次達賴候選者共有三人，依照向例，應富以拈鬮方法來決定。但因在靑海江土崖地方覓得的六歲童子拉木登珠，已有種種確鑿象微，證明是達賴喇嘛轉世無疑，所以中央特准取消拈關儀式，正式任命拉木登珠為第十四輩達賴喇嘛。同時派遺以蒙藏委員會委員長吳忠信氏為首席的龐大代表團前往拉薩，參加拉木登珠的坐床大典，國府並撥款四十萬元，作為登位大典的費用。</p>
<p>中央為甚麼這樣重視達賴喇嘛坐床即位的大典呢？因為佛敎是西藏社會的中心，達賴和班禪分握著全藏的政敎大權，在西藏一切政治、經濟、軍事、敎育、以及文字、語言、風俗、習慣等，莫不帶有濃厚的佛敎色彩。</p>
<p>佛敎創始於印度釋迦牟尼王子。在波羅王朝時，佛敎在印度曾招受很大的厄運，因為回敎徒從阿刺伯侵入，焚燬寺院，殘殺佛徒。於是促成許多佛敎徒逃往印度北部，再由北部流人西藏。以後又有印度佛學家蓮華生和弟子二十五人來西藏宣揚佛敎，這時西藏佛敎，才可算正式確立。</p>
<p>可是不久西藏佛敎却招受了藏王達瑪和民衆的反對，大受摧殘。直到印度佛學家阿堤沙來藏宣敎後，西藏佛敎才又復興起來。但復興後，却弄得派別分岐，相互傾軋。加之有不少異徒流入，例如寗瑪派、薩嘉派等，非但不守敎規，任意留髮娶妻，而目驕奢淫佚，更以邪術惑人，幾將佛敎在西藏的命運給斷送了。這時在靑海西寗地方崛起了一位復興佛敎的大師宗喀巴，他因目睹當時各派惡化現狀，便決心改革，獨創黃教，改用黃巴服裝，以別於當時各派的紅色服裝。並且改訂敎律，排斥幻術。宗氏看到娶妻生子授衣鉢是紅敎滅亡的原因，所以始創化身說，就是人死後能寄胎轉生，仍舊不昧本性。宗氏死後，他的兩個大弟子凱珠、結操分駐在前藏拉薩和後藏日喀則，世世代代實行轉身辦法，找尋繼承職位者，由此奠定佛敎在西藏政教兩方面勢力的基礎，這就是後世所稱的達賴和班禪。</p>
<p>這次即位的第十四世達賴喇嘛拉木登珠據傳很為聰穎沉著，有異常兒。國民政府頒佈准他繼任達賴喇嘛的命令中也說他慧性湛深，靈異特著」，可見他是位異於常人的「神童」。這次即位大典中，不許任何外國人士參加，而中央政府却特別派遣重要代表團，專程前往拉薩，因此引起一般人對西藏未來政策的演變，格外注目。這次達賴即位大典，或將為「中藏關係」開一新紀元。</p>
<h3>囤積居奇</h3>
<p>— 趙蜓年作</p>
<p>社會</p>
<h3>利用集體力量</h3>
<p>— 柏何華</p>
<p>美國洛杉磯有個外科醫生盧斯，他認為每人每月付一塊五毛錢的會費，可以得到一切醫藥上的治療——門診，出診，開刀，病院，醫藥等。但，這是需要許多人來贊助和參加的</p>
<p>不久，水電公司的五百僱員來向他登記了。為了順利的進行，他聯合洛斯醫生，僱用了一個看護，成立「洛斯盧斯需院」。</p>
<p>他們的車業蒸騰日上。不渦為　抵補開銷，月費也增到兩塊五毛錢。在洛杉磯的郊外，有十處分院，專任的醫生也由兩人增到六十五人。登記者，不用說，是增加得更多了。登記者的家屬，也可以享受優待辦法。外埠有好多醫生模仿着成立類似的組織。</p>
<p>我們應該知道，這不僅對於一般平民有利，對於一般醫生也是合算的。在這裏供職的醫生最高的年薪是一萬二千塊，最低的是三千六百塊。而加利福尼亞州醫生的平均收入，每年是三千五百七十七塊，還得扣掉其他費用。</p>
<p>洛斯醫生說：「如果說這種制度不能在各地實施，那是毫無理由的。」而我們也委實想不出什麼理由來，除掉頑同和保守。</p>
<p>在我們這個一切都沒有保障的社會裏，健康自然不會例外。許多的人是冤枉地死掉，難道我們的人口眞的是太多了嗎？我不知道是不是有賢明的人士肯考慮一下。</p>
<p>我覺得這事實昭示我們一個很好的敎訓。一切的利益得用集體的力量去爭取的。在這地方，為什麼物價如此地高漲呢，除了操縱，別的理由都說不通。</p>
<p>那麼，多數的人民幹嗎要被很少的奸商操縱呢？當前的生活問題沉重地壓在每一個市民的心頭，大家能不找出路嗎？</p>
<p>我們可以擺脫操縱，我們可以有出路。集合羣力成立消費的組織，平衡物價。但這需要賢明的租界當局和賢明的社會人士的帮助和倡導。</p>

<h3>電影五十周紀念感言</h3>
<p>— 新良</p>
<p>自從第一部創作的影片在一八九一年於美國公映後，到今日，電影已經有了整整的五十年的歷史了。為了要慶賀這一個偉大的紀念，本市外僑巳在進行着籌備發起舉行慶祝會，詳情已由新影君在本刊報道過了，這裏，筆者只想寫發句勉言，聊作紀念的文字而已。</p>
<p>五十年的歷史，設短不短，說長不長，可是，電影在這個時期裏的發展，確是非常驚人的。由默片，而聲片，而五影片，而卡通片，其問正不知道已經建立了多少的勳功偉業。電影不但是一種消遺，娛樂的東西，並且在敎育上，文化上，有它不能忽略的地位。</p>
<p>有人說：『看一木電影，正如看一本好書，同樣地它也可以給我們以精神上的安慰，與身心方面的進益。』無疑地電影事業的在將來更會發揚光大，是無可否認的事實。</p>
<p>每一個從事着電影企業的人，與每一個電影藝人，在這紀念的塲合，都該各自觀察一下，在過去五十年中，電影事業是如何地燦爛光明，是如何地偉大驚人，為了保持過往的榮譽計，為了使電影事業更臻完美計，每一個人正應該努力來擴展這條藝術的大路。</p>
<p>回頭看看我們中國的電影事業，待改良的地方，眞可以說是很多很多，努力吧，趁今年恰是電影五十周年紀念的當兒，讓我們來一次總動員吧，不要留戀於低級趣味的，無意識的電影上了。只要我們肯努力，肯苦幹，實幹，我們是不讓英美的電影專美於前的。我希望，等到中國電影的五十周紀念的時候，我們要眞能趕上他們一樣的境地。</p>

<h3>華聯演話劇</h3>
<p>— 籌成</p>
<p>華聯同業會之娛樂科，於二七日為該會新設之診所舉行開幕典禮，請醫學博士朱仰高揭幕，嚴美烈嚴淑美兩小姐剪彩，餘興表演「黃昏後」，劇情是在孤島三不管的地界，兩間破舊的房屋內，住了兩個失業工人，一個是年靑的獨身漢民叫阿毛，一個是有了妻女的叫陳二窪子，可是為了失業，他的妻是跟着依靠特殊勢力過日的金嘴去了，女兒翠蘭，也被携了去，陳二為衣食所這，有時只得做剝田雞的勾當，但阿毛是不知道的。五日後翠蘭逃回來，說金嘴逼她富嚮導女，且向她調戲，可是金嘴又追來了，結果大起衝突，陳二事敗，被捕拘去，阿毛持斧去尋金嘴復仇，臨行與翠蘭的好，事畢一同離開孤島。待阿毛回來，翠蘭已迫不及待，而在內室自殺，阿毛尙誤以為翠蘭先走。飾陳二的身患疾病，無力顧及妻女，不得已做剝田雞以度日，謂雖喪良心，但比較金嘴靠特殊勢力以貽害同胞者，究勝一籌。飾阿毛的不受金嘴的引誘，不願與其同流合污，情願衣食不週而受苦，扮相旣皆相稱，說白又甚透澈，觀眾莫不潛歎。</p>

<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>某王爺演搭桌戲之趣聞（上）</p>
<p>遜淸世襲某王，自幼酷嗜戲劇，同光年間凡是宗室貴冑沒有不歡喜哼幾句皮黃或崑腔的，當時名角如林，不但有好戲聽，就是以王爺的身分隨便請那位名伶敎授幾齣戲，那也是非常容易而且都能得到眞傳。某王學會了許多戲，每逢各王公府邸有喜慶壽事，他總興高采烈要客串一兩齣過過他的戲癮，賀客們一瞧見戲單上寫着某爺台淸客串的字樣就知道是他老人家了。從前某爺楚家產巨萬，舉動豪華，揮金如土慣了的。所以每逢他票一齣戲，勿論同他配演的大小角兒以及後台裏的管事管箱甚至打洗臉水看大門的雜役人等都能得到他的賞賜的。有時每演一齣戲至少也須開銷幾十兩銀子，在那時候孫菊仙外串一劇劇猶不過八十金，許多人且以為聞所米聞，算是打破紀錄的最高戲份，某王爺旣是這樣豪闊，所以他一進後台，但聽得一片恭維聲，你也給王爺請安，他也給王爺道好，前呼後擁的進來，（奴僕及幫吃喝的。照例走到那裏跟到那裏。）密密層層的圍裏着，那種氣派，着實令人羨慕。誰知一到民國，旗人的生活，一天比一天艱窘起來，一般王公的後人，揮霍成性，當然不能馬上現出吝嗇的樣子，外面的虛架子雖是依舊擺着，落不下來，可是內裏的悄形就大非昔比了。某王爺自然也是遭到同樣的境遇先還可以敷衍度日，不料後來竟連三餐都混不上了！（一八四）</p>

<h3>Chinese Forces Recapture Mentougou; Japanese Army Suffers a Great Defeat, Leaving Behind Many Corpses; Railway Transportation Thoroughly Destroyed</h3>
<p>A certain location in Hebei: Chinese forces are extremely active in the suburbs of Beiping, launching frequent attacks and achieving significant victories each time. The night before last, a certain unit of the Chinese forces suddenly launched a fierce attack on the Japanese troops in Mentougou.

<h3>Bai Chongxi Reports on the Latest War Situation; Long-Term Struggle to Fight to the End; Victory is Approaching Day by Day</h3>
<p>Guilin Air Dispatch: Director Bai Chongxi received the Guilin cultural circles in a certain location at 2:00 PM on the 19th and reported on the latest war situation. He first explained that the international situation is extremely favorable to us, and the enemy countries are becoming increasingly isolated diplomatically. He then stated that our</p>
<p>Supreme Strategy</p>
<p>is a war of attrition. In a war of attrition, there are three opportunities for victory: first, to strive for self-reliance and persevere in struggle, working hard to drive out the enemy; second, to deplete the enemy's material and financial resources, leading to the enemy's collapse; and third, to wait for a more favorable international situation to arrive, using the power of the world to jointly resolve the tyrannical enemy. The above three</p>
<p>Opportunities for Victory</p>
<p>are all very possible and have already manifested themselves in reality, proving their possibility, drawing closer day by day. For example, since the Second Phase of the War of Resistance, the enemy has suffered consecutive</p>
<p>Crushing Defeats</p>
<p>militarily in Shanxi, northern Hubei, northern Hunan, southern Guangxi, and northern Guangdong. This shows that the enemy's military strength has entered a process of decline. Secondly, the enemy's troop strength, at the maximum limit of national mobilization, is about 75 to 80 divisions, but currently more than 50 divisions have been mobilized, with about 46 divisions used on the battlefield. The replenishment of each unit is always more than 30 times. In the past, they were mostly strong and fit active soldiers, but now they are mostly old and weak reservists and replacement soldiers, which shows the enemy's personnel</p>
<p>Replenishment Difficulties.</p>
<p>As for our defense forces, not only are there more and more soldiers as we fight, but with each day and battle experience, tactics and combat are improving day by day, becoming stronger and stronger. Economically, the war expenses consumed by the enemy in the past 30 months have reached over 20 billion yen. The enemy country is a country with inherent deficiencies. In peacetime, its finances have already shown great flaws. If it continues to consume in this way, I really don't know how it will end. This has been fully exposed in Saito's questions, revealing the Japanese people's worries and grievances. Looking at the enemy country's public debt, by the end of March this year, it will reach 24 billion yen, and by next spring, it will break through</p>
<p>30 Billion</p>
<p>Yen. This alarming figure will force the enemy country's economy to inevitably go down the tragic path of total collapse. Because of economic reasons, it will be linked to military affairs, making it impossible for the enemy to occupy and hold, or to hold for long, and will ultimately lead to a complete defeat, like Germany in the First World War, or Napoleon's invasion of Moscow, repeating another historical failure. Diplomatically, the recent international situation is as described above, and Japan's isolation will only increase, and one day, countries will bring out more powerful forces to jointly</p>
<p>Impose Sanctions</p>
<p>on Japan. However, the aforementioned opportunities cannot be reached in a short period of time, so the mentality of "quick victory" is a big mistake. Only through more persevering long-term struggle, fighting to the end, can we win the glory of final victory. As for the enemy fighting with us in southern Guangxi, this is very beneficial to us, and we are very sorry that the enemy did not continue to advance deeply. (Dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<h3>Huang Dawei's Puppet Troops Defect One After Another</h3>
<p>Fujian Frontline: Since Huang Dawei's puppet regimental commander Chen Guangrui, Hu Laipu, and others led their troops, totaling over 2,000, who had landed on Xitaiwu Mountain in Xiamen, with all their weapons such as machine guns and rifles, to defect on the afternoon of the 19th, the Japanese forces have shown signs of disintegration. There are still over a thousand puppet officers and soldiers there, mostly from Hubei province, fully armed. Because the Japanese detained Huang Dawei and severely oppressed the puppet troops, driving them to the front lines, they were extremely resentful. They defected en masse on the 20th and are currently fighting with the Japanese in the vicinity of Taiwu Mountain and Gangwei (southwest of Xiamen). (Dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>Guilin: When the Chinese forces recaptured Dongshan, they captured over eighty Japanese and puppet soldiers, and over two hundred surrendered. (Dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<h3>All Sectors in Chongqing Today Remotely Celebrate the Enthronement of the Dalai Lama; A Celebration Meeting Is Held at Chang'an Temple; President Chiang and Others Send Congratulatory Telegrams</h3>

<h3>China Plans to Increase Mercury Production</h3>
<p>Chongqing: China is currently taking steps to increase mercury production. The Guizhou Mining Bureau, jointly managed by the National Resources Commission and the Guizhou Provincial Government, plans to increase its capital from 600,000 yuan to 2 million yuan, hoping to increase annual mercury production to 500 tons in two years. The world's annual production of mercury is 2,000 to 3,000 tons. During the World War, China's annual production of mercury reached 200 tons, but it subsequently decreased sharply. In 1938, China even imported mercury for use in newly established chemical factories. (Reuters dispatch from the 21st)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Japan's New Southern Advance Policy</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Japanese Prime Minister Koiso, in answering questions about the "Southern Policy" at the Diet's budget meeting, stated that "it is planned to use Taiwan and the South Seas Mandate Territories as a base for the peaceful economic development of South China, Thailand, the Straits Settlements, and the Dutch East Indies." At the same time, it is also rumored that Koiso, after recently inspecting the South Seas Mandate Territories, has drafted various plans to expand economic influence in the South Seas. Such news is not particularly surprising because the Japanese have coveted the South Seas for decades, a fact known to the world. In Japan's attempts at external aggression, there have always been two slogans that are considered equally important: "Manchuria and Mongolia are Japan's continental lifeline" and "The South Seas are Japan's maritime lifeline." Now that Japan is dreaming of dominating Asia and creating the so-called Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, it is inevitable that they cannot forget the South Seas, which have great significance in both economic and military aspects. Moreover, the current international situation and the political situation in Japan have factors that stimulate the ambition to implement the Southern Advance.</p>
<p>The term South Seas commonly refers to Thailand, Annam, Burma, the Malay Archipelago, Borneo, the East Indies, and the Philippine Islands, covering an area of approximately 4.4 million square kilometers, with a population of over 120 million, and abundant resources. However, industry is not well-developed. From an economic perspective, it is a vast market for goods and a treasure trove for raw materials. The South Seas' most famous resources such as oil, rubber, timber, cotton, rice, iron, tin, and coal are not only essential resources for military and industrial needs, but also necessary for daily life and general industry. From a geographical perspective, the importance is even more evident. Many places have great military value and are key strongholds on the periphery of the Asian continent. If combined with Australia, it could control Pacific traffic. On the other hand, European countries must grasp the South Seas in order to preserve their various rights and interests in Asia. If the United States wants to maintain its interests in the Pacific and prevent threats from overseas, it must also maintain the status quo of the South Seas. Similarly, Japan must seize the South Seas in order to implement its East Asian hegemony.</p>
<p>Japan has spent a lot of energy in the past to implement the Southern Advance policy. Its competition with Britain and the United States in naval power was not for China, but for the preparation to seize the South Seas. At the same time, it used the power of goods and women to engage in peaceful struggles with the British, French, American, and Dutch countries that owned the South Seas, and the results were quite rewarding. Then, it used religion and culture as tools to import political influence, doing its utmost to engage in various agitations in various places, hoping to reap the benefits of a fisherman. In addition, Japan also took the lead in establishing various foundations militarily. The fishing industry operated by Japan in the South Seas was by no means purely for fishing. It has also been rumored that the Japanese once invested more than 5 million guilders in eastern Borneo, building more than 500 oil wells without oil production, and nearby there were facilities similar to those used by the navy and air force. From this, it can be seen that Japan's attempt on the South Seas is not limited to developing economic influence, and that its ultimate goal is to incorporate the South Seas into its own territory.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of this European war, although Japan has been mired in China, it is actually no longer able to do anything elsewhere. However, ambitious Japan cannot help but imagine that the international situation has given it a very favorable opportunity. Countries such as Britain and France naturally have many places to accommodate Japan on the Far East issue, which further stimulates Japan's insatiable ambition. In particular, Japan has always believed that the Dutch East Indies are the easiest to attack in the South Seas. The Netherlands itself is in a difficult situation under the threat of the European war, and it is currently impossible to determine whether it can do its best to protect its colonies in the South Seas, but at least it must be significantly affected. Recently, Japan announced the invalidity of the Japan-Netherlands arbitration treaty, which is probably also harboring some kind of attempt. At the same time, Japan's own environment is also forcing it to embark on the path of the Southern Advance policy. Because after the termination of the US-Japan commercial treaty in January of this year, the United States may retaliate at any time against Japan's actions to exclude American rights and interests in China. Therefore, for the sake of commodity markets and military raw materials, Japan cannot but pre-plan remedial measures in the South Seas. In addition, the current South Seas, such as Annam and Burma, have become transit routes for Chinese goods, which the Japanese are not happy with either. Therefore, the implementation of Japan's Southern Advance policy is actually tantamount to a flanking attack on the invasion of China.</p>
<p>What Koiso said this time, the proposed peaceful economic development policy, if it were a truly peaceful economic development policy, why would it be necessary to use the South Seas Mandate Territories and Taiwan as a base? The above two places are not the center of Japanese industry and commerce; and everyone knows that the Caroline Islands have been built by Japan as a naval outpost. In fact, the so-called peaceful economic development policy that Japan is talking about now has the same meaning as its past catchphrase of "no territorial ambition." If the peaceful development policy is ineffective, then we cannot but rely on force. In short, clever robbery and forceful seizure are two-pronged. In the current situation, there is absolutely no possibility for Japan's so-called peaceful development policy to succeed. First, after more than a year of war, Japan's economy has reached the point of being exhausted and impoverished, where will the huge sums of money come from to develop the economic power of the South Seas? Second, the governments of various countries in the South Seas have long felt disgusted and fearful of the development of Japan's economic power in the past, how can they continue to let it go and increase their own insecurity? Third, the economy of the South Seas is most closely related to overseas Chinese. In the past two years, Japan's economic power in the South Seas has suffered huge blows due to the overseas Chinese's economic break with Japan and boycott of Japanese goods. Recovery is extremely difficult, and what is the point of development? Therefore, Japan's peaceful economic development may be the prelude to a military strategy. Of course, it is also impossible for Japan to launch a military force now, but if it makes enough fierce gestures of military aggression, perhaps the Netherlands will accept its set!</p>
<p>The current South Seas is actually the same as the Northeast before "September 18th." Japan already has many detailed investigations, in-depth research, and precise arrangements for it. International people all know that the crisis in the South Seas is gradually expanding with the passage of time. Countries with significant rights and interests in the South Seas must now give serious consideration to how to respond to Japan's military and economic offensive! This is really a link in Japan's war of aggression against China!</p>
<h3>US Government Continues Silver Purchase Policy; China's Monetary System Becomes More Stable; US House Foreign Affairs Committee Discusses Embargo Against Japan; Hull's Advisor Opposes Applying Neutrality Act in the Far East</h3>
<p>Washington: Government officials here unanimously support the silver purchase program for China. They point out that China must obtain US dollars and British pounds with silver in order to continue resisting Japan. Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated, "The United States' sale of silver to China can make China's monetary system more stable. China's monetary system has in fact recovered." (Associated Press dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>Washington: The Foreign Affairs Committee convened its weekly meeting today to discuss the issue of banning arms shipments to Japan. Secretary of State Hull and other State Department officials were unable to attend due to various reasons. Therefore, it is feared that today's meeting will not have any important developments. Hull's legal advisor, Hackworth, testified yesterday before the House Banking Committee that the United States should avoid applying the Neutrality Act in the Far East. At that time, someone asked Hackworth whether the United States' avoidance of applying the Neutrality Act in the Far East was because American interests had not been affected. Hackworth replied, "American interests in the Far East have been harmed, but if the United States implements the Neutrality Act in that area, the losses of American expatriates will be further increased." It is heard that in today's meeting, the proposal to implement the Neutrality Act in the Far East will be shelved. (Associated Press dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>Cambridge, Baltimore: Castle, former Undersecretary of State during President Hoover's administration, stated in a speech here last night that implementing a ban on the import of Japanese goods into the United States is an insult to a friendly nation and will not actually hinder Japan's invasion of China. It is inappropriate for the United States to serve as the world's policeman. Serving in this capacity may lead to unfortunate events. When the United States gave Japan six months' notice to terminate the 1911 US-Japan commercial treaty, Japan feared that it would be cut off from supplies by the United States. Someone told me a few weeks ago that Japan had already reached agreements with the Dutch East Indies and Mexico regarding the supply of oil needed by Japan. At the same time, someone told me that Japan had already obtained the scrap iron it needed. Therefore, implementing an embargo against Japan may trigger (1) Japan's formal declaration of war against China, making Japan's blockade of China legitimate, (2) Japan's alliance with Germany and the Soviet Union, (3) Japan's alliance with Germany and the subsequent action of the Japanese Navy against British colonies in the East, (4) Japanese soldiers taking retaliatory measures to damage the property of American people in China and Japan, (5) the United States experiencing significant economic losses. In 1938, Japan bought goods from the United States worth US$240,000,000. Implementing an embargo would be the beginning of war. I also said that Japan wants to declare war on the United States, but I believe that Japanese crazy youth officers who attacked the American "Panay" may sink American ships in retaliation, or even damage American merchants in Japan. What achievements will the United States achieve by fighting with Japan? What will be the result of the war? Japan may be exhausted, or China may turn red. The Philippines will undoubtedly be destroyed, and it is highly possible that democratic countries will fail in the European war." (Associated Press dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<h3>American Newspaper Authority Talks About China Being Unconquerable; The United States' Tolerance of Japan Has Its Limits; Hopes Japanese Politicians Can Realize This Early</h3>
<p>Honolulu - Mr. Howard, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Scripps-Howard newspaper group, spoke to a reporter from the Honolulu Advertiser today while on the "Lurline" to Hawaii, saying: "The clear-headed people who were previously oppressed by the Japanese warlords and dared not express their opinions are now gradually emerging. It is expected that wise men in Japan will soon make the Japanese warlords realize that China is unconquerable and understand the necessity of establishing an honorable peace. Therefore, a sound and rational economic system is now possible. I believe the time for mediating the Sino-Japanese War has matured. What is needed is a reliable mediator who can take into account the conditions of both parties and preserve the face of both parties for there to be any hope." Mr. Howard believes that the United States does not need to implement an export embargo against Japan at this time. "Japanese politicians are by no means fools. They must know that the United States' tolerance of Japan has reached its limit and will not force the United States to use this weapon. In fact, those who hold a sharp weapon in their hands do not need to use it to obtain results." When asked if President Roosevelt intended to run for a third term, Mr. Howard replied that the answer to this question was not in Washington, but in the development of the European and Far Eastern wars. When asked for his views on Undersecretary of State Welles' trip to Europe, Mr. Howard replied, "I believe that if this trip has a 50% chance of success, it is worth taking."

<h3>Eastern Newspaper Actually Uses War to Intimidate the United States</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The "Miyako Shimbun" in Japan claimed in an article today that the relationship between Japan and the United States is not just one of conflict but of hostility, and a few more steps could lead to serious consequences. If the United States wants to frustrate Japan by force, Japan will welcome the fight. Japan is not afraid of American provocations. Although we do not like this idea, if the United States challenges us, we cannot avoid it. The United States' attempt to guarantee the situation in China is tantamount to challenging Japan.

<h3>British Embassy in China's Relocation to Chongqing Question; Butler Answers Legislator's Question, Believes It Is Not Necessary at Present</h3>
<p>London - Last night, the Lower House raised the question of moving the British Embassy in China to a location closer to the Chinese government. Conservative Party member Mr. Pym asked: "The Soviet and American embassies in China are close to the Chinese government, making it easier to engage in commercial discussions and negotiations. Can the Prime Minister consider moving the British Embassy to an equally advantageous location?" Undersecretary of State Butler replied: "Although the main office of the British Embassy in China is in Shanghai, the Ambassador often goes to Chongqing and is currently there. When the Ambassador is not in Chongqing, a senior member of the Embassy office acts as his representative and maintains contact with the Chinese government. This arrangement is still convenient for maintaining contact with various Chinese departments regarding British interests. Foreign Secretary Halifax believes that there is no need for change at present." (Reuters dispatch from the 21st)</p>

<h3>Japanese Budget Committee Passes General Budget Bill; All Factions Jointly Submit Five Supplementary Clauses; The Original Proposal is Expected to Pass the House of Representatives Today</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The huge 10.3 billion yen general budget for the next fiscal year was approved today in the Budget Committee with supplementary resolutions jointly submitted by various factions of the House of Representatives. It will be submitted at the formal meeting scheduled for 1:00 PM tomorrow (the 22nd), and it is expected to pass without amendments and will be delivered to the House of Peers immediately. Thus, the first half of the deliberation of the 75th Diet session has passed and it will enter the second half. The House of Representatives will concentrate its efforts on deliberating tax system revisions and other bills, while the House of Peers will wait for the House of Representatives to send the budget bill before holding a formal meeting at 10:00 AM on the 23rd, where Finance Minister Sakurauchi will deliver a financial speech. On the same day, the Budget Committee will also be convened to immediately begin questioning. (Allied dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>Tokyo - As a result of negotiations between the three factions, Seiyukai, Minseito, and Kakushin, regarding the joint supplementary resolution to the budget bill, the compromise plan was decided as follows: (1) When implementing the budget, the best possible measures should be sought to adjust materials, capital, and labor, and to prevent malignant inflation. (2) A considerable portion of this budget is created in response to the current situation. Special restrictions should be applied when implementing these types of items, and implementation should be concentrated on facilities that are urgently needed or already in progress. (3) When establishing the materials mobilization plan for Showa 15, the increase in the production of important materials such as iron, coal, electricity, fertilizer, and important grains should be the top priority to ensure the people's livelihood and to stipulate the general policy for adjusting the supply and demand of materials. (4) The rampant nature of the black market is due to the inappropriateness of price policies and material allocation. The government should promptly seek appropriate countermeasures to eradicate this problem. (5) In order to implement a wartime economy, the official history system should be resolutely and fundamentally reformed to break the ills of bureaucratic self-righteousness and correct the defects of bureaucratic control. (6) In order to achieve the purpose of the incident, the government should strengthen the domestic system to promote innovation in all aspects of governance. (Allied dispatch from the 21st)</p>

<h3>Chamberlain Accuses Norway of Not Fulfilling Neutral Country Responsibilities; Says Germany Is the One Destroying Norwegian Neutrality; British Navy's Entry into Norwegian Territorial Waters Was a Last Resort</h3>
<p>London - The British Lower House welcomed Navy Minister Churchill with enthusiastic cheers last night. Prime Minister Chamberlain then rose to describe the origins of the rescue of British prisoners of war on the German ship Altmark, pointing out that this action was handled extremely well. He said that these British prisoners of war had been trapped on a naval supply ship for more than three months. The British government is now awaiting a detailed report from the British military officer who handled this matter, but he knows that the Lower House will share the government's delight that the crew members of the ships sunk by the German battleship Graf Spee had finally been rescued after being imprisoned for a long time. He knows that members of the Lower House will also want to sincerely congratulate the Navy on this new achievement in the history of the British Navy. Apart from the initial protest received by the British Foreign Secretary on February 17, the British government has not yet received a formal communication from the Norwegian government. As for the remarks made by Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht in the Norwegian Parliament yesterday, he has read the full text in the newspapers. He would like to offer a slight criticism of this. He feels that these remarks make it more difficult to understand the actions of the Norwegian government than he had previously imagined. We initially thought that the Norwegian authorities had made some checks on the Altmark. What we were dissatisfied with was that the checks were not thorough enough, so that it was not discovered that there were British prisoners of war hidden on board. But now we know that the Norwegian authorities did not conduct any checks on this ship. According to Norwegian views, since the Altmark was a warship and flew the German flag, a request for inspection could not be made. A senior naval officer in Bergen felt that this was inappropriate and eventually blocked its advance, but the German ship was never allowed to be inspected. This German ship used wireless telegraphy in Norwegian territorial waters, which most destroyed Norwegian neutrality, but the Norwegian authorities took no action other than issuing a reprimand and accepting an apology. The British side requested that troops be jointly dispatched with Norway to conduct an appropriate inspection in Bergen, but the Norwegian side refused. And Norwegian officers also refused to accompany British sailors to board the German ship. From this it can be seen that the Norwegian authorities did not make an appropriate inspection of this matter not just once, but three or four times. The British ship did not take any action against this German ship until Norway repeatedly refused. If this were not the case, Norway would not have stopped it, nor would it have inspected it, but would have allowed this German ship to complete its voyage back to Germany. Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht also said that the Norwegian authorities did not know that the Altmark was carrying British prisoners of war. It should be known that the fact that this German ship was carrying British prisoners of war was published in world newspapers weeks ago. Therefore, Koht's remarks are surprising. He does not want to make a judgment here that the Norwegian authorities are inattentive to the German fleet's use of Norwegian territorial waters, but it is also impossible. Although this indifferent and inattentive attitude is due to German pressure, in the British government's view, it is greatly opposed to the active and fair implementation of the responsibilities that a neutral country should have towards belligerent countries. According to Koht's opinion, the Norwegian government sees no reason to oppose German warships using hundreds of miles of Norwegian territorial waters to escape capture on the high seas and transport British prisoners of war to German prisoner of war camps. This view, as the British government knows, is inconsistent with international law. In the British government's opinion, this view will legitimize Germany's abuse of neutral territorial waters, and create a situation that the British government cannot recognize under any circumstances. (Cheers from the crowd) At the same time, Lord Stanhope, the leader of the Upper House, also made the same remarks in the Upper House as Chamberlain. The Labor Party members of the Upper and Lower Houses also fully supported the British warship's interception of the German ship Altmark and the rescue of 299 British prisoners of war. Former Labor cabinet member Alexander spoke on behalf of the Labor Party and expressed his satisfaction with the points made by the Prime Minister. Labor Party member Lord Strabolgi in the Upper House also represented the Labor Party in expressing satisfaction with the actions of the British Navy and sympathy for the Norwegian people, especially the Norwegian sailors who were killed by Nazi pirates for no reason. (Reuters dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>British and French Public Opinion Support Chamberlain's Arguments</p>
<p>London - Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech was recently commented on by political figures who said that the government's firm attitude towards the "Altmark" case has made a deep impression on the general public. According to well-informed sources, the British government not only refuses to make any concessions, but will also take the necessary measures to ensure that Norwegian territorial waters are no longer used by Germany. As for the argument made by Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht that ships belonging to foreign governments cannot be inspected by neutral countries, this argument is difficult to establish. If this is true, then all ships of the Soviet Union are owned by the government, and no country can inspect them. Is there any reason for this? Regarding Norway's intention to appeal to the League of Nations, if the neutral countries violate international law and fail to respect British rights during the current war, Britain can naturally act at will so that its rights are respected. In addition, the "Altmark" involves not only Britain and Norway, but also Germany. If Germany refuses to accept this procedure and the decision of the arbitration court, then Norway will still be in vain. In short, if Norway fails to force Germany to respect its neutrality due to weak strength or other reasons, then Britain should take the necessary measures to protect its national interests, such as sending patrol ships to protect Norwegian territorial waters or protect British merchant ships, so that Germany does not use Norwegian territorial waters to import prohibited goods. This is one example, because Germany can only use Norwegian territorial waters to import iron ore from Norway and Sweden when the Baltic Sea is frozen. (Havas dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>Paris - Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech was recently commented on by political figures here who said that the arguments made by Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht yesterday have been firmly answered by Prime Minister Chamberlain, and the arguments he put forward are supported by the French side. What kind of impact Germany's use of neutral territorial waters will have should be clearly defined. Although warships of belligerent countries can pass through neutral territorial waters, their nature is accidental and their time must be short. They must not stay in neutral territorial waters for a long time, as the "Altmark" and other German ships have done. It has long been the case that German warships have been using thousands of miles of Norwegian territorial waters to avoid attacks by British warships. This has also been admitted by the Italian newspapers. For example, the Italian newspaper "Il Messaggero" once reported that German warships had sailed through Norwegian territorial waters to the port of Petsamo in northern Finland and then returned to Germany along the same route, which can be taken as proof. In short, by using this convenience, the German navy attacked merchant ships on the North Sea, not only British and French merchant ships, but also merchant ships of neutral countries were spared. Now that Norway is allowing Germany to use its territorial waters, it is not only violating international law, but also violating neutrality. When the American cargo ship "City of Flint" sailed to a Norwegian port last year, the prisoners it was carrying were released. At that time, the actions of the Norwegian authorities were in line with international law. Up to this point, they have suddenly changed their attitude, which is difficult to understand. If the country cannot strictly maintain neutrality, then British and French warships must take the necessary measures to ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future.

<p>Norwegian Newspaper Expresses Dissatisfaction with the Arrogant Attitude of the British Prime Minister</p>
<p>Oslo - The newspapers here criticized Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech yesterday. The Conservative Party's Morgenbladet stated, "The key to the 'Altmark' case was never understood by Prime Minister Chamberlain. In other words, Norway's neutrality regulations were formulated and notified to all countries two years ago, and Britain did not express any objection at that time. Prime Minister Chamberlain is now criticizing the Norwegian government because he has discovered a situation that is more favorable to Germany. This arrogant attitude is enough to make its allies feel frustrated." The Conservative Party's Aftenposten stated that the Norwegian government is confident that its actions are in accordance with international law, which is also completely in line with the international law that Britain previously understood. If Britain believes that Norway is wrong, it may seek justice from the International Court of Justice. The Farmers' Party's organ, Nationen, also said this, and said that Norway is an ally of Britain, and it is disappointing for the British government to add such actions to its friend. If Britain continues to do this, international law will face a crisis. (Havas dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<p>Norwegian Foreign Minister Explains Reasons for Not Conducting Inspections</p>
<p>Oslo - After British Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech yesterday in response to Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht's statements, the Norwegian Telegraph Bureau asked Foreign Minister Koht for his opinion. According to his reply, the Norwegian government's theory on the issue of warships passing through neutral territorial waters is completely consistent with that of Britain. The two governments have been conducting talks since last year to agree that all types of warships may sail within Norwegian territorial waters, and there is no restriction on the sailing time, that is, there is no need to consider the routine 24-hour limit. Germany's "Altmark" should be regarded as a warship and is entitled to the same rights, and it refused to accept inspection. As to whether the ship was carrying prisoners of war, it does not affect its status as a warship and it is still entitled to freedom of navigation. (Havas dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<p>Captain of the Altmark Makes a Statement</p>
<p>Stockholm - Newspapers here published a statement by Captain Dau of the German ship "Altmark." Captain Dau is 67 years old. He said that when the European war broke out, the "Altmark" was near the West Indies, preparing to transport kerosene to Rotterdam. At that time, he received orders to serve as an assistant ship to the "Admiral Graf Spee." After the naval battle near Uruguay, he was ordered to return to his country. Among the British prisoners of war he was carrying were the crew members of six British merchant ships, including two captains. They received the same food as the German crew. The German crew did not resist the attack by the British ships. (Haitong dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Captain Dau of the German ship Altmark stated on the German official radio station last night that the stern of the Altmark is now aground, its rudder is broken, and one of its engines is damaged. The Germans will try to rescue the ship from danger and then consider future actions. Dau said about the British soldiers boarding the ship that he ordered the Altmark to run aground to prevent the British from capturing the ship and taking it away. There were indeed several pistols on board, but they were never used. (Reuters dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>Soviet Newspaper Criticizes British and French Interference in Neutral Countries</p>
<p>Moscow - Regarding the Altmark case, Soviet newspapers are all speaking out in favor of Germany. The Red Star newspaper stated, "Britain and France have already gone from empty threats to directly interfering in neutral countries." But the Communist Party's organ, Pravda, severely criticized an article published yesterday by the German newspaper "Der Abend" that accused the "Soviet Union of ambitious designs to expand its power to the Atlantic coast," saying that it was inappropriate for German newspapers to use "arguments held by the British side" to attack the Soviet Union.

In Italy, it is speculated that the ship is specially designed to supply the aforementioned German pocket battleship. (Havas dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<h3>Many Italian Ships Go to Germany to Transport Coal; Question Raised in British Lower House</h3>
<p>London - At a meeting of the House of Commons today, opposition Labour Party member Mr. [illegible] asked why the British Navy did not intercept the more than sixteen Italian ships that had loaded German coal from the port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands and returned to their country in the last three weeks. Economic Warfare Minister Cross replied immediately that this was indeed the case. King George VI had issued an order stipulating that when blocking foreign trade, the damage suffered by neutral countries should be kept to a minimum. The reason why the government did not inspect these Italian ships was to strictly comply with the King's order. At the same time, negotiations have been conducted with other countries to obtain coal. This deadline is approaching, so Italian ships will soon be subject to inspection by British warships. (Havas dispatch from the 20th)</p>

<h3>Several Alarming Incidents in Helsinki in One Day: Intense Aerial Combat Between Soviet and Finnish Forces; Soviets Claim to Have Shot Down 47 Finnish Aircraft; Report of the Fall of the Koivisto Fortress Denied Officially by Finnish Communiqué</h3>
<p>Helsinki - Yesterday, Helsinki issued air raid alerts six times, both in the morning and afternoon. The morning alerts were due to several Soviet air force personnel parachuting down northwest of Helsinki, resulting in most of them perishing, with three captured. In the afternoon, eighty Soviet aircraft flew over Helsinki, conducting reconnaissance at high altitude. (Haitong Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>Stockholm - A correspondent for "瑞京日報" (Svenska Dagbladet) stationed in Finland reported by telephone that no fewer than six hundred Soviet aircraft bombed various locations in Finland yesterday. The city of Riihimäki was bombed twice, both times severely. The first time, thirty Soviet aircraft arrived, and the second time, fourteen. Both waves dropped incendiary bombs, destroying one children's facility. (Havas Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Helsinki - Another air raid alert was issued here this morning. Soviet aircraft were extremely active in various inland areas yesterday, bombing locations in Kuovola, Litti, Hanko, and Karjaa. Over ten Soviet aircraft were shot down by our forces. (Havas Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>London - According to Soviet military claims, the largest Finnish fortress and the town of Koivisto, at the eastern end of the Mannerheim Line, have been captured. According to the latest Finnish communiqué, however, there was no mention of Koivisto, stating only that Soviet attacks on Muolaa have been repelled. If the Soviets have occupied Koivisto, it is about ten miles from Viipuri. (Reuters Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>Helsinki - Today, military authorities here formally denied Soviet claims of occupying the Finnish fortress at Koivisto. This fortress defends the eastern end of the Mannerheim Line and is of extreme military importance. (Reuters Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>Moscow - According to a communiqué issued by the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, air combat between Soviet and Finnish forces was exceptionally fierce yesterday. Soviet air forces shot down 47 enemy aircraft, while also heavily bombing enemy troops and rear military targets. In the Karelian Isthmus, Soviet offensives have made progress. Soviet forces occupied Joutselkä and forests, while also clearing enemy troops from the Joutselkä Peninsula, capturing large amounts of spoils. There were no other significant developments on other fronts. (TASS Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>Helsinki - The General Headquarters recently issued a battle report stating: (1) In the Karelian Isthmus, Red Army forces launched multiple attacks on our positions between the Gulf of Finland and Lake Muolaanjärvi, all of which failed. Attempts to advance near Lake Suvanto were also repelled, resulting in heavy losses. Those in the area of the Vuoksi River launched fierce attacks on our forces, but were heavily damaged and retreated. (2) Northeast of Lake Ladoga, after our army's great victory in the area of Siskonjärvi, the Red Army launched a counter-offensive, which was also repelled. Our army is currently clearing out the remaining enemy forces. (3) In the northern sector of the Salla region, fierce fighting continues. Our army has captured several Red Army strongholds. (4) A Red Army unit, under the cover of tanks and armored snowmobiles, attempted to advance across Lake Ladoga, but was defeated by our coastal defense batteries, suffering the loss of two hundred soldiers and one tank. (5) Our aircraft, in addition to reconnaissance flights, bombed Red Army concentration points and shot down 12 enemy aircraft, six of which have not been confirmed. (6) Our capital city issued air raid alerts six times today. At that time, one Soviet aircraft flew to the western suburbs of the capital city, and several pilots parachuted down. Three of them have been captured by our army, and the rest have been killed. Recently, Soviet aircraft have been very active, flying to various parts of our country to bomb. Their techniques are very sophisticated, indicating that "foreign experts" have joined the Soviet air force. Their air raid targets are aimed at destroying the morale of our people, so they often drop bombs arbitrarily, indiscriminately using machine guns to strafe innocent civilians, which is truly outrageous.

<h3>Soviet Aircraft Drop Bombs, Erroneously Hitting Swedish Territory, Destroying Four Houses</h3>
<p>Stockholm - It is reported that Soviet aircraft dropped bombs in the village of Paajara, located five miles from the Finnish border, destroying four houses and slightly damaging one church. According to sources here, one Soviet aircraft dropped ten high-explosive bombs and several incendiary bombs. The main street in the village has been destroyed. Fortunately, no one was injured. Visibility was very good at the time, making it surprising that the Soviet pilots could have mistaken their target. (Reuters Telegram, 20th)</p>
<h3>Britain and France Intensify Efforts to Aid Finland, Engaging in Diplomatic Discussions with Three Nordic Countries</h3>
<p>London - Regarding the intensification of aid to Finland, in addition to mutual consultations, Britain and France are actively exchanging views with the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula. The scope of aid is not limited to the supply of military equipment, but also includes the dispatch of volunteers. Because the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula still insist that no more than one hundred volunteers from Britain and France can pass through their territory to Finland each day, the British and French governments are working hard to negotiate with these countries in the hope of raising this limit. Since many British and French people have applied to go to Finland to fight, and a large number of volunteers are ready to depart, it is necessary to send them as soon as possible. In short, the difficulty in transportation and the inability to supply Finland with a large number of military supplies and volunteers is actually due to diplomatic difficulties. Britain and France are currently intensifying contacts with the governments of the countries concerned, precisely for this reason. (Havas Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>Oslo - It is reported here that the Swedish military is exerting pressure to participate in the Finnish war, leading to a constitutional crisis. Some Swedish newspapers are severely criticizing the government for refusing Finland's request for military assistance. A certain newspaper in Stockholm openly stated that if the situation continues like this, it will be intolerable. It is now urgent to expand the volunteer movement so that Swedish soldiers can participate in the Finnish war. However, King Gustav V of Sweden, in a speech on Sunday, also agreed with the government's decision, saying that Sweden must maintain its attitude to avoid being drawn into the war.

<h3>Japan's Trade Volume with the United States Has Not Decreased</h3>
<p>Washington - Although the Japanese government has adopted restrictions on imported goods from various countries, the value of goods exported from the United States to Japan last year was still $140,500,000, a decrease of only $8,570,000 compared to the previous year. Among them, the quantities of American cotton, kerosene, automobiles, and aircraft were all less than in the previous year, but the quantities of scrap iron, copper, and machinery have increased. The value of Japanese goods exported to the United States last year totaled $161,960,000, an increase of $25,434,000 compared to the previous year, but this was actually due to rising prices. (Havas Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>U.S. Exports to the Soviet Union Increase Sharply, Mostly Military Raw Materials</h3>
<p>New York - Dow Jones News Service in Washington reports that the U.S. Department of Commerce recently revealed that since the outbreak of the European war, the Soviet Union has purchased goods from the United States, of which military equipment and machinery necessary for wartime industries account for almost all. According to an analysis, in the five months up to October 31st, U.S. exports to the Soviet Union totaled $36,000,000, of which $33,000,000 were war necessities. Exports to the Soviet Union in January consisted entirely of copper and metal machinery, worth $11,313,000, while U.S. exports to the Soviet Union in January of last year were worth only $757,000.

<h3>Romanian Government Replies to British Inquiry, Explaining Kerosene Policy, Expressing Willingness to Distribute Evenly Between Britain and Germany; Last Year's Kerosene Shipments to Germany Did Not Meet Quota</h3>
<p>London - The Romanian reply to British inquiries regarding kerosene policy was received on Monday. The document, several pages long, stated that Romania has no intention of leaning towards Germany and is willing to distribute kerosene evenly between Britain and Germany. According to the reply, the agreement between Romania and Germany only provides for the supply of 130,000 tons of kerosene per month, or 1,560,000 tons per year, to Germany. It also stated that in the past year, Germany could have obtained 1,300,000 tons of kerosene, but due to transportation difficulties, Germany only received 850,000 tons last year, with 450,000 tons undelivered. Although this number still belongs to Germany, Germany can still extract it if it wants to, but it is questionable whether Germany's transportation capacity actually allows it. As for aviation fuel, exports are prohibited to all countries. Finally, the establishment of the Romanian Kerosene Department is aimed at increasing production and increasing domestic storage capacity. (United Press Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>Sweden Suffers Heavy Losses in the European War; Foreign Minister Reports to Parliament</h3>
<p>Stockholm - After Parliament passed a vote of confidence in the Prime Minister's foreign policy, Foreign Minister Günther announced the losses suffered by Sweden in this war, stating that since the outbreak of the war, a total of thirty Swedish cargo ships have been sunk by torpedoes or underwater mines, totaling 60,040 tons. Sixteen of these were confirmed to have been sunk by German submarines, accounting for 6.6% of the tonnage lost. Of those heading to neutral countries, 53% of the tonnage lost was between neutral ports. None of the Swedish ships escorted by British and French warships were sunk. The Foreign Minister then discussed the principles concerning submarine warfare stipulated in the 1936 London Convention, stating that ships that were sunk by torpedo were not given the order to halt, nor did they refuse inspection, so it was a violation of this principle. Both sides in the war are making justifiable claims, but the evidence they hold is not acceptable to Sweden and other neutral countries. The whole issue will be discussed jointly at the end of this month at a meeting convened by the foreign ministers of the Scandinavian countries. (Reuters Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>German-Built American Ships Have Already Been Delivered</h3>
<p>Paris - According to a report from Rome, an Italian newspaper reported that a British cruiser appeared near Petsamo, on the Arctic coast of northern Finland. German ships often enter Norwegian territorial waters near that area, so the Allies have had to pay special attention to the ports in that area. However, an Italian newspaper criticized this news, asking what the British navy intended to do. (Reuters Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>New York - The New York World-Telegram recently reported that the German oil tanker "Scandinavia," weighing 10,000 tons, departed from Hamburg at the end of January, sailed along the Danish coast, and reached Oslo, Norway. It was immediately registered in Norway, changed to the Norwegian flag, and hired Norwegian crew members to drive it, taking the northern British seas to arrive at the port of New York on the 14th of this month, and yesterday raised the anchor and headed to the port of Atascosa in Texas. The fact that Norway facilitates German ships to cross the British naval blockade can be seen from this. (Havas Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>New York - A 10,000-ton oil tanker built by Germany for the American Coal Oil Company arrived here yesterday, much to the surprise of the people. First, because in the face of the tight British blockade, this oil tanker built by Germany arrived in New York safely. Second, it is remarkable that Germany can still deliver foreign orders during wartime. (Haitong Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>Germany Orders Confiscation of Polish Farms and Forests</h3>
<p>Bern - General Göring, the head of Germany's Four-Year Plan and Minister of Aviation, issued an order today that all farms and forests owned by Poles in the occupied territories of Poland shall be managed by the German authorities. Although this order did not directly and simply use the word "confiscation," the "Züricher Tagesanzeiger" correspondent in Germany reported that the original text of the order used the word "other," which is actually an infringement of the private rights of the Polish people, and its impact cannot be overstated. The general intention of Germany's move is to increase agricultural production in order to improve Germany's food supply, while also intensifying the oppression of Poles in the occupied territories, so that they can be Germanized as soon as possible.

<h3>Turkish Cabinet Decision to Implement National Defense Emergency Law Attracts Great Attention in Berlin Political Circles; Report that British Officers Assist in Strengthening Defenses</h3>
<p>Ankara - The Turkish Cabinet has decided to implement the National Defense Emergency Law to defend the country. This law has been in effect since January, but will not be implemented until the government announces that special circumstances exist. This law authorizes the government to take special measures to protect the country's economy and adapt it to the needs of national defense. The Supreme Military Council is scheduled to hold a meeting today. (Reuters Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam - According to reports here, the Turkish Cabinet's decision to implement the Emergency National Defense Law to defend the country has attracted great attention in Berlin political circles. Although the Turkish government has declared that this is a precautionary measure, the German government has expressed surprise at the need for this law. The Turkish Foreign Minister's speech at the Balkan Conference had a certain effect on appeasing Nazi public opinion, but there are currently various rumors about Turkey's "military preparations." It is generally said that Turkey and the Allies are now preparing to launch an attack on the Soviet Union, but most Nazi observers believe that U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles' visit to Europe will hinder the implementation of this offensive. People here express satisfaction that Welles will visit other countries before visiting Berlin. (Reuters Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>Ankara - Regarding the Turkish government's announcement yesterday of the implementation of the law to protect the national economic organization, British personnel here are greatly surprised and are preparing to participate in the war. However, well-informed sources believe that this is an oversensitive speculation, but point out that this law can be implemented in any of the following three situations, according to regulations: (1) Partial or complete mobilization of Turkey; (2) Turkey is preparing to participate in the war; (3) Countries related to Turkey enter a state of war. It is also learned that the Turkish National Defense Conference was held in Ankara the day before yesterday, and it is thought that the holding of this conference is related to the implementation of the National Defense Economic Protection Law. In fact, the Turkish National Defense Conference is usually held in February. Until its content is announced, it is impossible to speculate on its motives. (Haitong Telegram, [Date illegible])</p>
<p>Berlin - The German News Agency in Sofia reports that about 50 British artillery and engineering officers arrived in Edirne, Turkey last week to assist in expanding the fortresses between Edirne and Kırklareli, and the mission of the British officers in the Straits area is also related to the above task. Kırklareli is about thirty-three miles east of Edirne. It was ceded to Greece after the Great War, but was returned to Turkey when the Treaty of Lausanne was established in 1923. During the Balkan Wars of 1912-1913, the Bulgarian and Turkish armies fought the first major battle near this town.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Has No Ambitions Towards Sweden and Norway; The Soviet Union Accuses Britain and France of Spreading Rumors</h3>
<p>Moscow - The "Pravda" newspaper here today published an article refuting rumors abroad that the Soviet Union has ambitions to conquer Northern Europe, believing that these rumors are completely unfounded. The newspaper stated that Britain and France originally planned to use the Netherlands as a base for attacking the Soviet Union. Now, due to the Soviet victory in the Finnish army, the position of the Finnish army is in danger, and their original plan has been thwarted, greatly reducing the hope of winning the European war. Therefore, they are trying to put pressure on Sweden and Norway to abandon their neutrality. (United Press Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>Carelessness at West China University Causes Significant Losses</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The cause of the fire that broke out at West China Union University in Chengdu on Monday is still unknown, but rumors that someone set the fire are purely unfounded.

<h3>The French Concession Authorities Will Vigorously Suppress and Stabilize Prices. A Committee Has Been Formed to Undertake Adjustments. Severe Legal Action Will Be Taken Against Those Who Hoard and Speculate, Applying the Measures Promulgated by the National Government.</h3>
<p>Recently, in view of the soaring prices in the city, which are detrimental to the livelihood of ordinary people, the French Concession authorities convened a meeting on the 19th of this month to discuss measures to curb them. A reporter from this newspaper visited Eugène P. Auge, Chairman of the French Municipal Council and Consul-General, yesterday and learned that, in addition to adjusting the salaries of the Municipal Council's employees to ensure they can work with peace of mind, the French Concession authorities are now considering the general public and have decided to find ways to stabilize the prices of daily necessities. At the meeting the day before yesterday, it was decided to form a committee to be specifically responsible for investigating and setting prices. They are aware that they will inevitably face difficulties, but they will strive to do so. All work will focus on adjustments, aiming to be fair and impartial so that neither producers nor consumers suffer losses. Investors will receive the interest they deserve, and traders will obtain reasonable net profits, but undue profits will be strictly prohibited. It is hoped that those who hoard and speculate will realize this early. If they do not heed the warnings, they will be prosecuted in accordance with the "Measures for Assessing Prices and Suppressing Speculation and Manipulation in Times of Emergency" promulgated by the National Government on January 20 of last year. At the same time, it is also hoped that residents will not buy and hoard excessively, to avoid giving hoarders an excuse.</p>

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Should Guide the Suppression of Prices</p>
<p>The prices of goods in various industries in this city have been soaring recently, and the common people are suffering from severe threats. It is heard daily that those who cannot make ends meet are committing suicide. Although the authorities have repeatedly warned them to take the overall situation into consideration and not to hoard, monopolize, or collect, these madcap merchants have turned a deaf ear to good advice and are still plotting trouble. Therefore, the prices of various goods have not only not trended downward, but have continued to rise. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency yesterday specifically visited a commercial leader in this city to inquire about the reasons for the soaring prices and measures to suppress them. According to the person, the soaring prices in Shanghai are obviously caused by the general merchants controlling the spot goods. However, to suppress the market price, it is first necessary to strictly limit the market price of rice and coal so that various industries can reduce costs. Second, it is necessary to thoroughly investigate the inventory of other goods and investigate their costs and try to suppress them. However, this matter is of great importance and cannot be achieved by the efforts of one or two people. It should be led by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to convene those in charge of various trade associations to urge them to take the overall situation into consideration and not to monopolize, manipulate, or hoard, so as to avoid reaping their own destruction.</p>

<h3>Spring Festival Army慰勞</h3>
<p>Active Donations from Various Industries</p>
<p>The Spring Festival Army 慰勞 movement in this city has seen active donations from various industries. As of yesterday, it is reported that more than 600,000 yuan has been received. The association is now making a final effort. At a minimum, this city must raise 1 million yuan in 慰勞 funds. Therefore, the association hopes that various industries will continue to work hard to raise funds and actively donate to fulfill their responsibilities.</p>
<h3>One Yuan Auxiliary Currency Notes; No Need to Fear Panic</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance is Doing its Best to Coordinate the Circulation of Various Notes</p>
<p>In the past, there was an extreme shortage of fractional, auxiliary, and one-yuan currency notes in Shanghai, which affected the retail transactions of various industries. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to find a way to provide relief. The ministry then ordered the four banks, Bank of China, Central Bank, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank, to coordinate. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the banking community yesterday that the shortage and panic of fractional, auxiliary, and one-yuan currency notes has disappeared after</p>
<p>Maximum Coordination</p>
<p>(1) After the Ministry of Finance approved the issuance of additional fractional currency notes, the issuance will be determined based on market needs and there will be no so-called batches. Approximately 2.5 million yuan has already been issued, all in one- and five-cent notes. (2) Auxiliary currency notes have already been</p>
<p>Shipped from Hong Kong</p>
<p>2.6 million yuan, all in new editions of one-dime notes from the Farmers Bank of China in 1937. These are being issued and circulated on the market by HSBC and other banks. As for the old notes of one-dime, two-dime, 25-cent, and 50-cent denominations stored in the four banks, Bank of China, Central Bank, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank, as well as the Jiangsu Farmers Bank and Zhejiang Local Bank, they have also been sorted out and</p>
<p>Issued for Circulation</p>
<p>(3) The total amount of new central and Chinese currency notes of one yuan denomination shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai by HSBC and other banks is 10 million yuan, which will be shipped in three batches. The old notes stored in various banks have also been issued for circulation successively.</p>
<h3>The Salvation Army Only Manages the Shelters on Behalf</h3>
<p>The cost of provisions and all expenses are supplied by the competent authorities</p>
<p>The Refugee Relief Association said that the Salvation Army claimed to have more than 70,000 refugees and included the Dunxin Road Shelter among them, and issued printed materials to solicit donations from outside, which caused the donors of the Association to inquire with the Association. According to the Shanghai International Relief Committee yesterday, the Salvation Army in Shanghai only manages the refugees in the shelters on behalf of the Association and the Committee. Since the Dunxin Road Shelter was founded by the Association, the provisions and all expenses are paid by the Association. As for the routine management expenses of the International Second Shelter on the West Sémiramis Avenue Qiqi Road under the Committee, they are also fully planned by the Committee. However, outsiders, affected by excessive publicity, think that it is organized by the Salvation Army. In fact, the Salvation Army in Shanghai has not directly operated any shelters. However, since the Salvation Army only carries out prison reformation work in addition to preaching religion, and does not engage in refugee relief activities, the Committee hired Major Murray and others of the Army to manage the shelters on its behalf at the beginning of the war. As for how the Army will use the donations from the outside world this time, it is not convenient to make speculations.</p>
<h3>US Fleet Commander Returns to Shanghai on the Luzon</h3>
<p>Attends Washington's Birthday Celebration Today</p>
<p>Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the US Yangtze River Fleet, left Shanghai on the 13th of this month and sailed to Wuhu. The US ship Luzon carried a large amount of medicine for use by the American Church Public Hospital in Wuhu. Commander Glassford stayed in Wuhu for about a week. Now that the matter is over, he returned here on the original ship Luzon from Wuhu on the afternoon of the 20th. It is heard that Commander Glassford will attend the memorial service for the birth of the first US President George Washington today. Last night, Commander Glassford attended a dance banquet at the invitation of the American General Association. The Luzon is now berthed at the US naval pontoon.</p>
<h3>Japanese Plan to Occupy Duijiang Ferry; Tugboat Destroyed</h3>
<p>It was heard that the Pudong Lujia Ferry Wharf was opened yesterday morning. A tugboat of the Japanese-owned Huaguang Ferry Company sailed to the Yuhang Wharf in the French Concession across the river, hoping to operate for profit. Unexpectedly, the original Dongchang Road Ferry across the river (also relying on the Yuhang Wharf) was afraid that their livelihood would be taken away, so they gathered a crowd and destroyed a small Huaguang tugboat, which was returning to Pudong yesterday, by more than 200 boatmen. The cabin glass windows were completely smashed, the upper half of the chimney was knocked off, and countless bamboo poles were poked into the wooden hull. Although it did not sink, it could not be operated without major repairs, so the Japanese were unable to resume sailing. It is reported that although the Japanese side attaches great importance to this case, in view of the unity of the boatmen's gang and their fight for livelihood with their lives, it is not an intentional criminal act, so there is no way to start to put pressure on them.</p>
<h3>New Police Force Organization; All Controlled by the Puppet Government; Not Under the Jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Police, Most of the Police Officers are Appointed by the Puppet Side</h3>
<p>The Mainland News reported that the Municipal Council and the "Shanghai Municipal Government" signed an agreement last Friday, stipulating the establishment of a "Special Police Force" with sole authority in the extraterritorial road area. It is estimated that the members of the police force to be negotiated by Major Bowen, the Chief of the Public Concession Police, and Lu Ying, the "Chief of the Municipal Police Bureau," will be more than 1,200 people. Although this number seems large, it is heard that the "Special Police Force" will not only exercise its powers on the extraterritorial roads, but also the areas between the roads will be under the jurisdiction of the team. Moreover, most of the members of the "Special Police Force" are candidates designated by the "Municipal Government," and those sent from the candidates designated by the Municipal Council will not account for more than one-tenth of the team, and senior police officers will also be included. "Mayor" Chu Minyi will begin to launch meetings this week to discuss several extremely important issues in succession.</p>
<p>Expenses Borne by the Puppet Government</p>
<p>Although the new "Police Force" is a completely independent agency, in fact, it will become a part of the "Municipal Police Bureau" rather than a part of the Public Concession Police. Therefore, most of the team's expenses will be provided by the "Municipal Government," but financial issues will not be discussed by the police leaders and will be handled separately by the Municipal Council and the "Municipal Government." It is generally believed that this is one of the sections in the negotiation of the collection of donations in the road area outside the boundary.</p>
<p>Scope and Organization to be Discussed</p>
<p>The scope and organization of the new police force, the location of the general office, and the assignment of executors will be discussed by the police leaders. As for the special police station issue in the area where foreigners have huge properties, it will also be discussed. This issue has been provisionally agreed upon in principle. Some people advocate that the police station be located in the western part of Yu Road and Daxi Road.</p>
<p>The Treatment of Police Officers Also Needs to be Studied</p>
<p>Another issue to be discussed is the treatment of police officers transferred from the police department to the new police force. These police officers will naturally lose the benefits they enjoyed while serving in the Municipal Council after being transferred to the new police force. Therefore, the issue of providing appropriate compensation should also be discussed. It is heard that their treatment after joining the new police force will not be inferior to that given to them by the Municipal Council. According to the current plan, the "Special Police" will not only be in charge of the extraterritorial roads themselves, but will also govern all areas between the roads as far west as Hongqiao Road.</p>
<h3>Affordable Coal Briquettes – Unseen Restrictions on Sales – Customers at Stores Frequently Rejected, Stockpiles Unsold</h3>
<p>After the implementation of affordable coal briquettes, priced at 110 yuan per ton and 5.8 yuan per dan, each coal briquette factory, including Yi Tai and others, established temporary measures for handling store sales: (1) For those who have paid for goods but have not yet received them, if they find the price too high and request a refund, or if the goods are delivered and then returned, refunds and returns should be allowed in all cases. (2) For orders that have not been delivered, all deliveries should be temporarily suspended. If people come in person or call, if the issuing office has been duly registered, it can declare that payment should be made according to the market price at the time of registration, based on the registration date. For those who pay before delivery, the invoice should bear the original ordering date, and the delivery date should never be written. (3) Sell goods when available. For regular customers of the factory who urgently need fuel, offer a reasonable amount, limited to half a dan to one dan per household. Supply small, scattered customers as usual if there is stock. (4) For telephone orders, declare that immediate delivery is not possible and must wait for availability. The price will be based on the delivery date, as indicated on the invoice. All requests for pre-orders should be rejected. (5) For those who usually deliver, instruct tricycle carts to go directly to the factory to handle delivery. The quantity must still not exceed one dan. (6) For the selling price at stores, each issuing office must absolutely adhere to the set price and must not raise or lower it. This is of utmost importance. (7) For customers who come in person, you must absolutely deal with them politely and courteously and must never be impatient or offend them with your words. (8) To cope with the situation, all issuing office stores will open from 7:00 AM until closing time. (9) Find ways to watch out for competitors posing as users.</p>
<p>Unwilling to Clear Stockpile Receipts</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Coal Briquette Industry Association have stipulated that those holding coal briquette stockpile receipts should pay the stockpile rent and take delivery of the briquettes within ten days, from February 20th to the 29th. Late deliveries will be stopped and the briquettes will be repurchased at the original price. Receipt holders are urged to pay close attention. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned yesterday that the quantities of coal briquette stockpile receipts for each factory are as follows: Yi Tai Xing 5,500 tons, Guo Hua 4,000 tons, Nan Yang 6,000 tons, Dong Fang 2,200 tons, Yue Dong 500 tons, Hu Li Cheng 400 tons, Bei Yang 250 tons, Guang Hua 600 tons, Jing Hua 300 tons, Yuan Hua 200 tons, Nan Fang 500 tons, Hu Jiang 600 tons, Hua Tong 1,000 tons, totaling 22,450 tons. However, according to the charcoal industry, the coal briquette factories' affordable price policies do not offer the same preferential treatment to stores specializing in coal sales, resulting in customers blaming them and causing repeated disputes. Even for pre-purchased stockpile receipts, manufacturers reply that they cannot deliver due to selling at affordable prices, which contradicts the purpose of clearing the stockpile receipts within ten days. According to stockpile rules, it is free for the first seven days, and from the eighth day, a stockpile rent of five jiao per ton per month is charged, or two jiao per ton per day. If the stockpile rent is paid, the stockpile receipt can continue to be held. Therefore, if you want to implement affordable prices, you can only abolish the stockpile receipt system to avoid illegal operations.</p>
<p>Same Industry Indignant Over Seizing Available Stock</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Mechanism Coal Briquette Industry Association jointly announced the implementation of affordable prices for coal briquettes, users have been relieved. However, the reality is different. When users buy coal briquettes from charcoal shops or coal briquette stores, they are often rejected with the excuse of no stock, causing them to make wasted trips. Buying directly from the coal briquette factories is perceived as too little for too many, turning into a situation of having a price but no goods, which is heartbreaking for those concerned about people's livelihoods. It is understood that various public groups are discussing measures to strictly correct those who seize available stock. It is understood that a certain coal briquette factory attached to a coal briquette store on Rue Sappe, which is large in scale and a giant in the coal briquette industry, made profits of over two million last year. Recently, after the implementation of affordable sales by various factories, this factory alone is unwilling to lose money. Therefore, it has recently claimed that its machinery is damaged and has stopped manufacturing coal briquettes, while selling coal briquette raw materials in large quantities to a certain party at a high price of ten US dollars per ton, which has aroused the indignation of the same industry, which will ask the association to deal with it.</p>
<p>Coal Briquette Factories Implementing Affordable Prices</p>
<p>The following is a list of Shanghai Mechanical Coal Briquette Industry Association members implementing affordable prices: (1) Guang Hua Coal Briquette Factory (90 Xi'an Road, Office: 2nd Floor, 270 Beijing Road, China One Trust Company), (2) Guo Hua Coal Briquette Factory (MacKen Road, Office: 394 Rue du Pere Robert), (3) Hua Cheng Cui Ji Coal Briquette Factory (Yangshupu, Office: Zhengjia Muqiao Xia Linli), (4) Yuan Hua Coal Briquette Factory (A25 Binlang Road, Office: 22 Shengping Lane, Avenue Edward VII), (5) Dong Fang Coal Briquette Factory (19 Binlang Road, Office: New Garbage Bridge, Yu Qiaqing Road), (6) Nan Yang Coal Briquette Factory (Macao Road, Tokyo Road), (7) Yi Tai Xing Coal Briquette Factory (MacKen Road, Office: 280 MacKen Road), (8) Nan Hua Coal Briquette Factory (28 Route Tenant de la Tour), (9) Yue Dong Coal Briquette Factory (Opposite 514 Lane, Route Tenant de la Tour, Office: 510 Pudong Building, Avenue Edward VII), (10) Gong Yong Coal Briquette Factory (387 Lane, Changping Road, Hart Road), (11) Bei Yang Coal Briquette Factory (Inside 1302 Binlang Road, No. 52), (12) Hu Li Cheng Coal Briquette Factory (778 Tokyo Road), (13) He Ji Coal Briquette Factory (725 Route Doumer), (14) Yan Yan Coal Briquette Factory (580 Haining Road), (15) Jing Hua Coal Briquette Factory (Dapu Bridge, Xujiahui Road), (16) Nan Fang Chang Ji Coal Briquette Factory (94 Tokyo Road), (17) Xin Ping An Ji Coal Factory (153 Route Cardinal Mercier), (18) Jiang (Intersection of Changping Road and Tokyo Road), (19) Hua Tong (46, Lane 876, Gordon Road), (20) Yi Xin (Zhangjia Huaguo, Xinzha Road), (21) Li Xing (50, Lane 116, Chengdu Road), (22) Yong Tai (Intersection of Route Robert and Xiaoshadu Road), (23) Gong Dong (Intersection of Route Petain and Rue Massenet), (24) Hua Cheng Xing (Intersection of Connaught Road and Xiaoshadu Road).</p>
<p>Monopoly of Coal in Occupied Areas</p>
<p>The Mainland News reports that, according to reliable sources, the Japanese authorities are now monopolizing coal in the occupied areas outside the concessions, aiming to ensure that the Japanese army has a sufficient supply of fuel, and are using strict measures to deal with Japanese trading companies attempting to sell coal to foreign trading houses. These facts have been confirmed this week. On Monday, the Japanese authorities prevented the delivery of 300 tons of</p>
<p>Top-Quality Hard Coal</p>
<p>worth 70,000 yuan to a Chinese trading company in the French Concession. According to private investigations, Mitsui &amp; Co. sold the 300 tons of coal to an affiliated Japanese trading company for use by the Japanese-controlled Chinese Railways. However, the affiliated company did not follow the authorities' orders and resold the batch of coal into the French Concession. The</p>
<p>Japanese Military Police</p>
<p>heard the news and imposed restrictions. However, the coal had already been loaded onto six boats and arrived at the Bund outside the French Concession at the end of Avenue Edward VII, and the Japanese had no right to forcibly take the coal back. It is reported that the Japanese and French police informed a local police officer outside the concession that the batch of coal had been stolen from Mitsui &amp; Co. The police immediately detained the six coal-carrying boats. Subsequently, the Japanese military police claimed that the coal should be</p>
<p>Transported Back to Mitsui</p>
<p>&amp; Co., and only then did they stop. It is reported that coal stores outside the concession have received orders to first supply their coal to the Japanese naval authorities, then to Japanese-owned factories, and only then to foreign trading houses. Now, the Mitsui &amp; Co. wharf is piled high with coal, at least 30 feet high, mostly for the use of the Japanese authorities. Some Shanghai coal merchants believe that the Japanese order to control coal is certainly possible, but most coal mines are in Japanese-occupied areas, so the detailed facts are still unknown. However, according to people in the coal industry, coal used in the concessions is imported from abroad, so the Japanese monopoly has little impact.</p>
<h3>Fire at Automobile Tailor Shop – 14 Dead and Injured – Two Major Fires in the Western District Destroy Over a Thousand Rooms</h3>
<p>A fire broke out at the Dechang Automobile Tailor Shop, located at 123 Shanjia Garden, intersection of Avenue Yu Qiaqing and Route Bayle, Public Concession, at 3:00 AM yesterday, resulting in seven deaths and seven serious injuries. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Awakened in a Dream</p>
<p>Sun, wife of Li Changgeng from Ningbo, 32 years old, her mother, Zhang, 47 years old, and her eight-year-old son, Yongfu, lived at 123 Shanjia Garden, Route Bayle. The address was a three-story building where the Dechang Automobile Tailor Shop had been operating for more than a year. Unexpectedly, a fire broke out at around 3:00 AM yesterday. As it was late at night, no one noticed, causing the fire to spread rapidly. Residents nearby were awakened from their sleep and fled, moving boxes and luggage in a very chaotic situation.</p>
<p>Seven People Burned</p>
<p>Firefighters arrived and tried to put out the fire, which lasted about three hours until it was extinguished at 6:00 AM. As a result, in addition to the destruction of the entire building housing the Dechang Tailor Shop at 123, which had seven households, it also affected the neighboring 115, Huang Yongtai Paint Shop, 122, Yao Shunxing Clothing Store, and two buildings of Jiang’s Old Bookstore to the west, all of which were burned down. The Zengtai Pawnshop at 117 was only affected by water damage. At the time, seven people, including Yong native Du Ayin (injured from jumping from a building), his wife, Tong, his daughter, Abao, his son, Binghan, and Pudong women Gu Ye, Han Cai, and Wang Cai, were burned or injured from jumping from the building and were sent to Baolong Hospital by ambulance for treatment.</p>
<p>Seven People Die Tragically</p>
<p>The most tragic case was that of Gu Weiren, who lived on the second floor of the front building. After throwing down a quilt to save his mother, Gu Ye, who jumped out of the window to safety, he tried to save his wife, Gu Lanzhen, and his nephew, Wang Liangwen (7 years old), but failed, and all three perished together. At the same time, Li Sun, the wife of the landlord Li Changgeng on the third floor, and her eight-year-old son, Yongfu, as well as a mother and daughter named Xu who lived in the pavilion room, totaling three men and four women, met a tragic end in the fire. The bodies, charred beyond recognition, were found by firefighters in the rubble. The seven bodies were sent to the forensic office on Jiaozhou Road in the morning for examination by the court and then transported to the Dahua Funeral Home on Huxi Dunxin Road, where each family prepared for the funeral. The cause of the fire is currently unknown and is under investigation by the police.</p>
<p>Fire on Daxi Road Destroys Over a Thousand Houses</p>
<p>(China News Agency) A fire broke out yesterday at around 2:20 PM in the Zhujia Ku area behind Wangjia Lane on Daxi Road in Western Shanghai. There were over a thousand straw sheds, where poor people lived, as well as several factories. In an instant, smoke and flames soared, becoming uncontrollable. The Caojiadu Fire Brigade heard the alarm and drove to put out the fire. Residents there, carrying the old and the young, fled the scene, crying and wailing. At that time, the smoke and flames were intense, and the fire was raging out of control. Fire brigades from Central Jing'an Temple, Xinzha, and Yichang Road also sent more than ten pump trucks one after another to assist in the firefighting. After about three hours, the fire was extinguished. As a result, the Fuxin Cloth Factory, Jinxing Pliers Factory, and Huaxing Hardware Factory were all completely burned down. The Xuxu Cloth Factory (owned by Li Yihuai) burned down half a building, the Jinlong Cloth Factory burned down four rooms, the Hongsheng Dyeing and Weaving Factory destroyed half a building, the Houji Weaving Factory destroyed one room, the Zhenji Machine Factory destroyed eight rooms, the Yadong Iron Factory, the Licheng Glass Factory, the Lihua Glass Factory, the Xinxin Gambling Den, and over a thousand straw sheds were all destroyed. When the fire broke out in the Xinxin Gambling Den, all the gamblers and the den's staff fled, and all the cash on the gambling tables was burned before it could be taken out. Fortunately, the fire occurred during the day and no one was killed. The cause of the fire is under investigation.</p>
<p>Carelessness at Dyeing and Weaving Factory Injures a Female Worker</p>
<p>The China Dyeing and Weaving Factory on Route Lincoln, Route Hopeland, Western Shanghai, owned by Zheng Jingui (53 years old) from Fujian, was carelessly set on fire at around 1:00 AM yesterday. In an instant, the flames soared and spread rapidly. Workers heard the alarm and scattered. The Caojiadu Fire Brigade received the report and immediately drove to put out the fire. However, the fire was raging and burned for four hours before it could be extinguished. It is estimated that sixteen or seventeen factory buildings were burned down. When the fire was raging, a female worker, Shen Chengmei (26 years old), was unable to escape and was burned on her feet and other parts of her body. She was rescued by firefighters and sent to the Second Renji Hospital on Route Brenan, Western Shanghai, for treatment. It is reported that her injuries are severe and her life may be in danger. Rumors of two female workers being burned to death are inaccurate.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a major fire broke out in Zhujia Ku behind Zaijia Lane on Daxi Road, destroying more than a thousand bungalows and more than ten factory buildings, resulting in huge losses. Fortunately, it was during the day, and there were no deaths or injuries.

<h3>After the Death of National Doctor Zhu Nanshan, His Two Sons Engage in Major Litigation – He Huang Accuses Xiao Nan of Encroachment – Social Morality Should Not Be Allowed to Perish</h3>
<p>Zhu Xiaoyong and Zhu He Gao, both from Nantong and sons of the late famous doctor Zhu Nanshan, have their clinic in a self-built residence at 96 Changsha Road, intersection of Avenue Road. Normally, the brothers' consultation fees are distributed equally, and Shen Wendou, a registered person, serves as the accountant. There is a contract for mutual trust. Unexpectedly, recently, a rift suddenly appeared between the Zhu brothers, and civil and criminal lawsuits have arisen.</p>
<p>Brothers at Odds</p>
<p>The cause is nothing more than the issue of money, the root of all evil. First, Zhu He Gao filed a lawsuit against his elder brother, Xiao Nan, in the Civil Division of the First Special Court regarding the issue of accounting. It has been tried many times and has not yet concluded. Unexpectedly, one wave subsides, another rises. Zhu He Gao claims that his accountant, Shen Wendou, and Zhu Xiao Nan jointly embezzled 405 yuan in consultation fees paid by Xu Maotang. In addition to Xiao Nan's half share, the remaining 202.5 yuan was embezzled. Therefore, on New Year's Eve last year, he reported to the Xinzha Police Station. Detective Yang Feizhang first arrested Shen and then</p>
<p>Ordered Zhu Xiao Nan to Appear</p>
<p>Under questioning by Judge Xiao, it was pointed out that this type of case is a matter for prosecution, and since the plaintiff and defendant are brothers, it is inappropriate to litigate in court over trivial matters. He ordered them to try to reconcile outside the court. Shen Wendou was allowed to be released on bail of 200 yuan pending trial. However, during the adjournment, the Zhu brothers were so emotionally charged that reconciliation failed. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao again held a joint trial in the Second Criminal Division. He first asked Zhu He Gao whether the case still needed to proceed. The reply was</p>
<p>Determined to Sue</p>
<p>He is now suing Shen Wendou for breach of trust and Zhu Xiao Nan for encroachment. In addition to asking that they be punished according to the law, he must also attach a civil lawsuit, requesting the court to order the two defendants to jointly and severally compensate 202.5 yuan. When questioned, Shen Wendou still claimed that the consultation fee of Xu Lian Tang had not been</p>
<p>Collected in Full</p>
<p>And refused to be liable for compensation. When questioned, Zhu Xiao Nan stated that Xu's consultation fee was originally 555 yuan, but it was reduced after Yang Zisheng, the assistant manager of the China Remittance Bank, interceded with his younger brother, He Gao. Therefore, 405 yuan was paid, which was sent by Xu's man on April 6 last year.</p>
<p>I Received It</p>
<p>At that time, I declared to my younger brother that the money was deposited in the Daxia Bank in my personal name. It should have been divided equally, but last year, Du Yuesheng gave me a gold cigarette case and a gold watch, which He Gao took away without distributing them. Therefore, I also withheld this amount for reconciliation at the end of the year. It has nothing to do with Shen Wendou. At this point, the situation became clear. The debate was ordered to begin. First, the police lawyer Zhang Tianyin and the plaintiff's lawyer rose to state the requested measures and attached a civil lawsuit. Finally, Zhu Xiao Nan's lawyer, Hong Shihao, argued that since Zhu</p>
<p>After the Death of Nanshan</p>
<p>Xiao Nan is the eldest son, so he is the head of the family. The contract stipulates that the head of the family can use public funds. Now the plaintiff is litigating criminally for a small amount of over 200 yuan. The target of his civil lawsuit is 10,000 yuan, and the public fees paid have reached 800 yuan. Now, disregarding his brotherhood, he wants to put his elder brother in prison. Regardless of the details of the case, social morality should not be allowed to perish. This point should be noted. The court ordered the case to be</p>
<p>Concluded and adjourned</p>
<p>The defendants will be sentenced on the 28th.</p>
<h3>Opium Den Owner Arrested – Attempt to Bribe for Release Fails</h3>
<p>Li Jiegui, a Chinese detective of the Narcotics Division of the Central Police Station, arrested Suzhou natives Gao Ziming and Cai Fulin, who were operating an opium den, and eight opium smokers, including Hua Wenrong, Xu Wufeng, Shi Yinai, Zhang Dimei, Jiang Fushun, and Lu Lin, at 18, Lane 226, Fujian Road, at 2:00 PM yesterday. A large amount of raw opium, opium paste, and 1,121 yuan in opium money were confiscated. After being arrested, he secretly gave Detective Li 100 yuan in banknotes, asking for his release, but he failed. He was taken to the police station for investigation and was sent to the First Criminal Division of the First Special Court yesterday morning, where he was prosecuted for opening an opium den for profit and bribery. After Judge Jiang rigorously questioned the results, he was returned to prison pending judgment.</p>
<h3>Tiger Stove Partner Suddenly Attacked – Shot in the Chest, Very Critical</h3>
<p>The Guoqing Garden tiger stove at 260 Rue Massenet, French Concession, is owned by Wang Guogui and employs Lu Zhifu, 23 years old, from Tongzhou, as a partner, who is Wang Guozhu's nephew. Yesterday at 7:00 PM, while Lu was working, two thugs suddenly broke into the tiger stove, drew out guns, and fired two shots at Lu Zhifu. One bullet hit Lu in the chest. Lu did not realize he had been shot and ran out to escape. He ran to the back gate of 25 Xicheng Lane, Ximen Road, before collapsing. The two murderers, seeing that their purpose had been achieved, fled separately. When the French police received the report, they immediately sent a large number of detectives to investigate, but the murderers had already fled far away. An ambulance was called to send Lu Zhifu to Guangci Hospital for treatment. His injuries are severe, and his life is in danger. The cause of the attack is under investigation by the police.</p>
<h3>Selling Stored Stamps – Accused of Fraud – Yu Weisheng Found Not Guilty</h3>
<p>Yu Weisheng, an Austrian who once served as a senior official in the National Government (45 years old, residing at 3, Lane 11317, Route Lafayette), has a passion for stamp collecting. He had previously purchased many valuable stamps at high prices from Jigu Stamp Company on 42 Rue Lupan and Huangpu Stamp Company on Nanjing Road. Recently, due to financial difficulties, he intended to sell some of his collected stamps and entrusted Guangming Bookstore at 877 Jing'an Temple Road to find a buyer. Among them, there was one worth 50 US dollars (approximately 700 Chinese yuan), but Yu only priced it at 50 French yuan. Yu lowered the price because, although the stamp was valuable, it could not be determined to be genuine. At that time, a Western doctor, Rosenbaum, intended to purchase the stamp, but after identification, he discovered that there were many fakes and believed that Yu had committed fraud. He reported it to the Xinzha Police Station, and Chinese detective Ma Zhongrong arrested Yu and sent him to the First Special Court for trial. Yesterday morning, police lawyers Jiang Baokang and Peng Qiqi prosecuted him for fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Law, while Yu Weisheng hired Wang Yaotang and Zhu Hui as lawyers to defend him. They claimed that the defendant priced the stamp extremely low because the authenticity of the stamp was difficult to determine, and collecting stamps is the same as collecting antiques, and even if they are forgeries, they have considerable value. Therefore, the defendant's actions had no fraudulent intent, and the court should declare him not guilty. After questioning by Judge Dai Rongduo, Yu Weisheng was acquitted.</p>
<h3>Grand Engagement of the Hu and Xu Families</h3>
<p>Hu Xusheng, the eldest son of Mr. Hu Danhua, a local gentleman in the Yixiang District of this city, is 23 years old, a graduate of commerce, and currently the accounting director of the Hudong Hospital. Recently, through the introduction of Mr. Shen Jinzhang and Mr. Fei Zi'neng, he held an engagement ceremony with Ms. Xu Peilan, daughter of the Xu Xianfu family, a prominent family in Wuxi, in Shanghai. Dr. Sheng Qingcheng, a famous doctor, served as the marriage witness. Mr. Hu has a wide circle of friends, and there were many guests at the time.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory issued a weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday, stating that Shandong, this area, and the East China Sea will be sunny and cold, with some clouds and morning fog. There will be a seasonal wind from the strong to intense northwest to northeast. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the temperature in this port was a high of 49.8 and a low of 32.4. On the same day last year, the high was 50.9 and the low was 29.8.</p>
<h3>"Traitor of the Buddha" – Specializing in the Pursuit of Fame and Fortune – Lawsuits Between Monks in Temples Appear Repeatedly – Official Decree Should Be Thrown into the Eighteenth Level of Hell</h3>
<p>Monk Yuanhua, the former abbot of the Sanjiao Leshan Temple on Rue du Pere Robert, and Monk Guanru, the abbot of the Yuhuang Temple, and Monk Qinliang, the current abbot of the Leshan Temple, and Monk Kaineng, etc., have been in court over disputes over temple property for a long time. Recently, Monk Guanru and Monk Yuanhua hired lawyer Liu Xiang to file a criminal self-accusation in the Second Special Court against Qinliang, Kaineng, and others for obstructing freedom. Yesterday was the date for continued hearing. Both parties came to court with their lawyers. According to the plaintiffs, Monk Guanru, the defendants reported to the police for no reason, arrested us, and prevented us from taking things from the temple, etc. At this point, Judge Huang Yan angrily said to both parties, "You monks are supposed to believe in Buddha, and if you believe in Buddha, you must understand the meaning of Buddha. You are now all traitors of the Buddha, specializing in the pursuit of fame and fortune. If you believe in Buddha, you should sacrifice everything. Your six senses are not pure, and you are only messing around. Every judge has your lawsuits. I also believe in Buddha, and I hope that the Buddha will have the power to throw you into the eighteenth level of hell." He then ordered the case to be suspended and directed the parties to determine the property rights in the Civil Division before proceeding with the review.</p>

<h3>The Problem of Adjusting General and Vocational Education in Our Country (1)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Qibao</p>
<p>(Chongqing News Agency) After the Ministry of Education sent Mr. Cheng Qibao, who had served as a specialist for the Ministry of Education, Director of the Hubei Education Department, special editor for the Ministry of Education, and professor at various universities, to Europe to investigate primary school education before the war, he recently wrote an article entitled "The Problem of Adjusting General and Vocational Education in Our Country." It incisively points out current malpractices and is worthy of reference. Thus, we record the original text below. In the modern educational systems of various countries, we can find three trends: (1) democratic education, (2) class-conscious education, and (3) communist education. The so-called democratic education originated in the United States, its purpose is to develop individuality, and its method is to provide as many opportunities as possible to meet the educational needs of individuals. Since the founding of the United States is based on democracy, and there are no historical constraints, developing individuality and equal opportunities have become the main strategies in educational facilities. Today, the active promotion of general education in the United States is clear evidence of this strategy. In recent years, the federal government, recognizing the inadequacy of vocational education in the country, has subsidized local governments to promote vocational education. However, the general trend still leans towards general education. After obtaining basic knowledge, the general public feels satisfied, and their vocational skills training is not as strict as in continental European countries. The so-called class-conscious education is mostly seen in continental Europe. Its meaning is that everyone has inherent abilities, and since these abilities vary in level, their future positions in society also differ. In other words, people can be given equality in politics, but there is no such thing as equality in terms of innate abilities. Therefore, educational facilities must not be determined in quality and quantity according to their class. This is the origin of the parallel-track system in Germany, France, and other countries. This division of classes has definite standards. In the past, it was based solely on social status, so children of nobles and the upper class entered one track of schools, the purpose of which was to provide them with the best education possible to cultivate a ruling class in politics. As for the children of ordinary people, they entered another track of schools, the purpose of which was to provide them with vocational skills training according to their needs and interests, so that they could engage in productive work and not become social parasites. Since the European War, the spirit of democracy has gradually permeated education. This kind of education based on social class had to be changed and replaced with ability-based education. Taking Germany as an example, the so-called preparatory schools for noble children have been completely abolished, and four years of national basic school education is shared by all citizens. During these four years, teachers must observe the children's abilities and interests to determine whether they should pursue advanced studies or continue vocational training. Those who are suitable for advanced studies are encouraged to enter middle school and then university, while others are given vocational training to complete their skills for making a living. Therefore, the development of vocational supplementary education in Germany is far above that of other countries, which naturally has its reasons. The so-called communist education originated in Soviet Russia. Its purpose is to train general producers engaged in agriculture and industry, so it does not allow aristocratic or class-based education to create social inequality. Examining its entire school system, from kindergarten to university, all emphasize the cultivation of vocational skills, and the three major policies of educational productionization, educational scientization, and educational creation have become the criteria followed by educators nationwide.</p>
<h3>Zhongda Assistant Professor Wang Huawen Invents the All-Purpose Scale</h3>
<p>Can Simultaneously Weigh and Calculate Value</p>
<p>(Chongqing News Agency) Mr. Wang Huawen, an assistant professor in the Physics Department of Central University, felt that although traditional Chinese scales are widely used, their only function is to weigh objects (in fact, it should be called mass). If you want to know how much the weighed goods are worth, you still need to calculate it separately, which is very inconvenient. Therefore, he researched to improve it. Recently, Mr. Wang has successfully designed and invented a new scale called the "All-Purpose Scale." The scale has precise readings and is easy to use. It not only has the same effect as the old scale but also directly indicates the amount of money the weighed goods should be worth. In the future, stores and goods shops only need one "All-Purpose Scale," and both buyers and sellers can immediately clear the money and goods and complete the transaction. During the design period, Mr. Wang received a lot of help from his colleague Mr. Jin Youxun. The scale's instruction manual has now been compiled and printed and distributed to relevant parties, and it is said that it will soon be submitted to the government for inspection and implementation.</p>
<h3>Church Middle School Students in Beiping, Tianjin, and Changli</h3>
<p>Total 3,124 Students</p>
<p>Hebei was the first province to fall after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, and the oppression of the local education sector by the Japanese puppets was even greater than in other occupied provinces. However, some church schools were fortunate enough to maintain normal operations without harassment, so the number of students has greatly increased. According to a survey conducted by the local church authorities in Beiping, Tianjin, and Changli, the current total number of students in the nine existing secondary schools is 3,124. There are 1,241 high school students and 1,883 junior high school students.</p>

<h3>Famous American Basketball Coach Talks About Modern Basketball Tactics: Middle Schools Need to Preserve the Center Jump; Teams That Cannot Defend Have No Hope of Winning</h3>
<p>(New York News Agency) Mr. Antleyes, a famous old American basketball coach who has been the coach of the Syracuse basketball team for 16 years, expressed two opinions on modern basketball tactics: Modern basketball, since the center jump was abolished, has increased in speed, like watching a non-stop table tennis match all over the court. It is good to watch, but it is very harmful to the physical strength of young basketball players. It seems to be harmless to university players because their development is more complete. Therefore, according to Mr. Antleyes' observation, in the near future, basketball rules will inevitably be established separately. In middle school basketball games, the center jump is worth preserving to reduce its speed.</p>
<p>Mr. Antleyes further stated that the most difficult point in training in today's basketball tactics after the abolition of the center jump is to make them have defensive strength. In past games, the coach was very lucky to be able to keep the opponent from exceeding 50 points. The new ball game has caused players to concentrate on shooting, whether near or far, with one hand or two hands. University freshmen basketball players are all engaged in shooting practice and pay very little attention to defense. We must tell them that no matter how many points the team can score, those who cannot defend will never win a game.</p>

<h3>Floating Shorts Emerge: Gold Market Falls Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold unofficial market fell again. Although the Hong Kong gang came to absorb in the middle, the number was limited. Due to the rumor that notes and goods could not be pledged to the bank, sellers were quite crowded, so the result fell by 40 yuan. The opening in the morning was still flat, still at 4,830 yuan. Then, as the exchange market slightly hardened, the silver building gang agreed to release a sale, and a certain silver number sold forcefully, and immediately retreated to the 4,800 yuan mark. However, the Hong Kong gang and the securities gang searched for purchases and were pulled up by 20 yuan. But after this, the Hong Kong gang stopped buying, and retail bulls came out again, so the position was doubled, and the price fell to a low of 4,780 yuan. Then, a certain gold number took the opportunity to buy cheap, and at this time, the foreign exchange had reported back to equilibrium, so it returned to a high of 4,818 yuan. Finally, the silver building gang and retail investors came to vomit again, and the securities gang also turned from buying to rewarding, and the closing fell back to 4,785 yuan. The trading was slightly clear in the afternoon, about 2,300 taels. The price of silver building jewelry did not change. The price of customs gold remained flat.</p>

Then, the Hong Kong gang suddenly entrusted a certain silver building to buy on behalf, and at the same time, the securities gang also took in on behalf of customers, and returned to 20 yuan. The securities gang entered 50 taels in cash, at 4,820 yuan. After this, the Hong Kong gang stopped its activities, and a certain silver number came to sell forcefully, plus Qian Duiye also came out on behalf of customers, and plummeted by 40 yuan, breaking into the 4,800 yuan mark. Qian Duiye sold 20 taels to the gold number, at 4,780 yuan. Then, a certain gold number suddenly took in on behalf of this gang, and the exchange market had reported back to equilibrium, and re-rose by 38 yuan.

After entering, the securities gang slightly came out, and Qian Duiye also had the intention to sell, so it fell by 15 yuan. Qian Duiye sold 20 taels to the securities gang, at 4,790 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it fell by 40 yuan compared to the previous day, and the fluctuation was 50 yuan throughout the day. The cash number's own brand gold sold at a price of several yuan higher than the cash gold, and the purchase was reduced by 20 yuan. The current standard gold is more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there is little opening.</p>
<p>There is still no fluctuation in jewelry gold.</p>
<p>The gold for silver building jewelry has not moved all day long. Datongxing still counts 485 yuan, and the new industry is the same as the previous price. The purchase is reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Are Becoming More Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the demand for British and American gold pounds became scarce, and the market price was slightly softer. The supply and demand for British and American gold notes were not prosperous, and the market price was stable. The British gold note was 53.5 yuan in the morning, and the American gold note was 14.42 yuan, with no honor or disgrace compared to the previous night. In the afternoon, the thoughts of colleagues were slightly firmer, and the market price rose slightly. In the evening, the British gold note rose to 53.6 yuan, and the American gold note rose to 14.43 yuan. The supply and demand for Hong Kong notes and French franc notes were scarce, and the market price did not change. The Japanese gold note was stable, and it was still 1.29 yuan in the evening. The Korean note slightly rose back, and it was 1.05 yuan in the evening. Yesterday's market price for British and American gold pounds fell by one yuan, the British gold note rose by 0.1 yuan, and the American gold note rose by 0.01 yuan. The other currencies did not change.</p>
<h3>Securities: Bulls and Bears Are Equally Matched, and the Walls Are Getting Higher and Higher: Jardine Matheson Shares Exceed 100 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities unofficial market situation: People's hearts are still uncertain, but the original large and small households on both the bull and bear sides still adhere to their consistent principles and continue to add chips to each other, and the walls are getting higher and higher. The bull side's goal is the establishment of a new Sino-American loan, while the bear side focuses on the political aspects, so there will be major changes in the near future. Yesterday's half-day trading, the array of money on both the buying and selling sides was roughly the same as the day before. For example, Xinyilian continued to buy in, and Zhongyi Xinfu was relatively enthusiastic. Tongkang, Tongshun, and Jiufeng consistently sold out, and Zhongyi Tongkang was relatively crowded. The buying in of Renchang and No. 20, and the selling of No. 38 and No. 41 were also equally matched, so the price rose and fell suddenly, and rose and fell with supply and demand, but the high and low price differences were only one or two cents. As a result, the aircraft continued to rise by 0.05 or 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, and the number of transactions was about 400,000 yuan. The brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to the previous day</p>
<p>Unified A 57.40 57.30 57.40 Up 0.10</p>
<p>Unified B 50.60 50.55 50.60 Also 0.20</p>
<p>Unified C 48.80 48.20 48.40 Also 0.10</p>
<p>Unified D 47.80 47.50 47.55 Also 0.05</p>
<p>Unified E 48.50 47.90 48.05 Also 0.20</p>
<p>In stock trading, 40 shares of China First Trust Company were traded, and the price was 2 yuan and 0.25.</p>
<p>The stock market of the Public Industry Office is still very active, and the trend is uneven. Jardine Matheson shares rose due to good prospects, and the price started from 97.5 yuan and bought up to 104 yuan to close. The speed of Tengda is excellent in the remaining shares. Rubber shares are very stable, and the public has no urgent need to purchase each share, which shows that the chips held by the bulls seem to be full and excessive.</p>
<p>London, 20th telegram: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and British Far East company stocks were stable, and the market conditions remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Flowers: Raw Material Prices Are High, and Yarn Prices Are Firm</h3>
<p>The futures trading volume increased gradually last month.</p>
<p>The yarn market continues to be firm, and the rising wind is gradually rising. The reason is that the factory's raw materials are high and various opening costs have increased, so the opening yarn is still held for sale, and the chips are relatively lacking. At the same time, general economic households with looser funds come to absorb when the price is low, but the actual transaction is still slow. Therefore, the rising power is not strong.</p>
<p>The current yarn morning market, because the afternoon of the previous day has turned up, the opening is still good, and the buying atmosphere in the market is strong. The opening price of 20 double horses is 852 yuan, an increase of 16 or 17 yuan. It is said that the foreign exchange has slightly increased, and gold has slightly挫. The situation has eased, and floating shorts have come out. Part of the double horse has returned to 843 yuan. Once the price is tired, those who make cheap goods come to move again, and then rise by 45 yuan. The closing price is 847 yuan. The futures trading volume for March is gradually increasing. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 2,750 packages were traded, and the market price for 20 double horses rose by 12 yuan. Today, 190 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, 220 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, and 35 pieces to Haikou. The amount purchased by each gang is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Peers 2,455 Hong Kong 50</p>
<p>Mainland 245 Statistics 2,750</p>
<h3>Manufacturers Begin Cotton Procurement; Market Prices Become More Attractive</h3>
<p>The cotton trade has once again become lively. Both domestic and foreign factories have gradually started active procurement, causing market prices to become increasingly attractive. Furthermore, due to concerns among industry players that foreign exchange regulations might not be relaxed, they are not only unwilling to sell their existing stock but are instead seen holding onto it. Consequently, cotton prices are significantly higher than yarn prices, mainly due to thin inventory levels. The supply from Northern Jiangsu is limited, with only 269 bales of Tongzhou cotton arriving. The details of recent cotton transactions are recorded below:</p>
<p>Fire-damaged bales: 195.50, purchased by trading houses, 162 pieces</p>
<p>Xin Te: 170.00, another 150 pieces</p>
<p>Fire-damaged bales: 196.50, another 244 pieces</p>
<p>Tong Fine Cotton: 213.50, another 150 bales</p>
<p>Tongzhou Cotton: 203.00, another 300 bales</p>
<p>Fire Engine Cotton: 195.00, another 150 bales</p>
<p>Tongzhou Cotton: 209.00, purchased by Xin Yu, 1,200 bales</p>
<p>Chicken Foot Cotton: 209.00, another 1,700 bales</p>
<p>Middling American: 260.00, purchased by domestic and foreign firms, 1,200 pieces</p>
<p>American Pengjiapu: 208.00, purchased by trading houses, 100 pieces</p>
<p>Tongzhou Cotton: 201.00, another 700 bales</p>
<p>203.00</p>
<p>Additional News: Foreign Cotton Market Prices: In the New York cotton market, prices initially weakened due to reports of declines from Liverpool, falling by 45 points. Later, due to buying activity on Wall Street and some short covering, the closing price rebounded by 35 points. However, the price difference compared to the previous day was insignificant. The Indian cotton market was flat, while Egyptian cotton fell by over 10 points.</p>
<p>Trading in foreign cotton in Shanghai remains sluggish, but sellers are unwilling to lower prices. Factories show little interest in purchasing, and there are no reports of large-scale transactions by Japanese manufacturers. The following are the factory delivery prices for yesterday's cotton market, converted at an exchange rate of 6.875 yuan per US dollar:</p>
<p>20 count American Middling: 260.50</p>
<p>20 count: Substandard grade, 150.20</p>
<p>32 count: 273.00</p>

<h3>Food Grains: Rice Market Prone to Rumors; Foreign Rice Prices Soar</h3>
<p>The rice market had been declining steadily for several days, with a sudden drop of two yuan in the previous session. No. 1 Saigon had fallen to 47.50 yuan. Yesterday, prices continued to decline at the opening. However, some hoarders saw an opportunity and manipulated the market. On one hand, they spread rumors of a ban on shipments from abroad. On the other hand, they started buying aggressively. Merchants were misled and started hoarding, driving up prices. The price of No. 1 Saigon reached 50.05 yuan, an increase of three yuan compared to the previous session's close. However, reality could not be ignored; local shops were not selling well and could not sustain the high prices. Furthermore, hoarders, driven by profit motives, sold their stocks at high prices when they saw the market peak and heard that exchange rates had become more favorable. Therefore, the market was only driven by internal transactions and the price surge could not be sustained. Prices gradually declined, but the initial surge in the morning was too strong to resist. The closing prices were still about two yuan higher than the previous session. No. 1 Saigon closed at 49.50 yuan and 49.20 yuan; No. 2 at 48.30 yuan, then 47.70 yuan; Fire-milled at 48.50 yuan and 48 yuan; Xiaowen contracted at 57 yuan and 56.50 yuan (calculated for 224 pounds); Da Wen high grade at 45 yuan, then 43 yuan; Tokyo Jianjian at 45.50 yuan, then 44.30 yuan; Mixed Broken at 37.50 yuan to 36.80 yuan. Glutinous rice, both domestic and foreign, followed the price increases, rising by about one yuan. There were rumors that domestic thick japonica rice from Hongkou was not being shipped out. Off-market trading was intense, with prices rising by as much as two yuan. Kunshan high-grade japonica was selling for 54-55 yuan, while special thin grades were selling for 52 yuan, then 51 yuan. In summary, the rice industry is responsible for the sudden surge in rice prices. Flour is being sold at universally low prices, bringing widespread joy to the people. Coal briquettes for fuel are also following the trend of lower prices. Only the rice industry has been talking without taking action, deceiving people and manipulating the market everywhere. They sell inferior rice after promising good quality rice, and reduce the weight after weighing. Furthermore, rice shops close their doors, prioritizing their own safety over the public interest. There is no effective way to deal with the rice merchants' cunning and malice; they are allowed to do as they please, and it is beyond remedy. Government-subsidized sales continue, but it is a drop in the bucket, like lighting a lamp under the moonlight, beautiful in appearance but ineffective. It is like releasing a pickled carp; one does not know if it will live or die. Therefore, compared to the flour industry, the flour industry is more virtuous. It is also learned that the rumored ban on rice exports from coastal defense areas also had a minor impact on the Shanghai market. However, a large quantity of rice is expected to arrive soon, which is bringing down people's expectations. Prices have fallen by almost one yuan. No. 2 Saigon original bags have decreased from 57 yuan to 56.30 yuan. No. 2 Siam has decreased from 56.80 yuan to 56.30 yuan. Xiaojiao has decreased from 57 yuan to 56 yuan. A total of 900 tons of rice and 4,000 bags of existing rice have been released to the market.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Prices Stabilize</h3>
<p>Flour: Since factories started supplying 7,500 bags of flour at subsidized prices daily, customers have been lining up for dozens of houses at stores selling subsidized flour. People are crowded together, and those who arrived earlier may still not be able to buy flour, while those who arrived later may get ahead. This situation may not be understood by the general public, but it is not difficult to explain. It depends on whether those managing and supervising are considering the interests of the public. Unfortunately, some people wait all day and still cannot buy flour, and are even subjected to beatings, which is unfair to the poor. Recycled goods in the market, such as those from the Red and Blue Cart Warehouses, have been released in small quantities, priced at 14.50 yuan. Other goods are in a stagnant state. It is heard that due to the benefits of subsidized flour reaching the general public, a retail system is being discussed.</p>
<p>Wheat: Trading is also quiet. After a drop of half a yuan the day before, buyers are continuing to try to lower prices, while sellers, with thin stocks of existing and incoming wheat, are planning to hold on and wait for an opportunity. Therefore, only one carload of Suzhou wheat was traded throughout the day, priced at 27 yuan. Other transactions are temporarily stagnant.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Sales Still Strong in the Streets</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market situation, which had experienced a frenzy of price increases in the past week, has disappeared. Although the overall situation has stabilized, some hoarders are still searching for goods, so trading is still strong. In addition to 150 bags of Wuhu beans traded in this street for 28.40 yuan to 28.60 yuan, and 30 bags of Fu Sangyuan beans for 25.50 yuan, more than 1,200 bags of Nanjing beans were purchased by hoarders for prices ranging from 24 yuan to 25.50 yuan. Also, more than 100 bags of Chongming sand yellow were sold for 28.30 yuan. In addition, 12,380 bags of beans, 400 cans of bean oil, and 400 cans of raw oil were shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Foreign Firms' Silk Sales Stagnant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Yokohama silk sales fell again, with spot prices falling by 70 yuan and futures prices falling by 23 yuan. New York near-term futures fell by 1.2 cents, and deferred futures fell by 1 cent. Local foreign sales have stalled again. However, the user silk market is more active, with White Factory's 5,000 yuan and Jili Special Grade selling for 3,200 yuan. Only small transactions were made, with asking prices nearly 100 yuan higher than those of foreign firms. Coarse silk printing sales were also sluggish yesterday. On the 22nd, 75 pieces of tea were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Coal: Coal Dust Prices Skyrocket</h3>
<p>Recently, the business of various types of coal dust has been extremely lively. Factories, bathhouses, and other parties all have demand, and the trend continues unabated. As a result, market inventories are weak, and brokers are pushing up prices. The price difference varies greatly. Indian coal dust is priced at 280 yuan per ton, Kailuan coal dust at 245 yuan, and Keelung coal dust at 230 yuan. As a result, users complained yesterday about being unable to bear the burden. White coal layers such as Hongji, etc., are inferior in comparison. The reason for this is that scarcity makes things expensive and the source is not abundant.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Domestic and Foreign Sugar Rise Slightly</h3>
<p>Holland coarse granulated white sugar opened for March futures with 2,000 bags offered by the Da Chang Company, priced at 6.25 Dutch guilders, O.I.F. &amp; I.C. example.

Second to fourth grade coarse white sugar at the local warehouse is 62.5 yuan, new goods from foreign warehouses are 62.70 to 62.5 yuan, old goods are 62 yuan, and transit goods are still 49 yuan.

Dozens of boxes of domestic sugar and Green Stripes have been opened, priced at 39.2 yuan, up 2 jiao from before.</p>
<h3>Hardware: New Lead Wire Sales to Tianjin are Booming in Recent Days</h3>
<p>The sales of new lead wire are most extensive to the Tianjin gang. This street and other customer gangs only account for half of their sales. Recently, the Tianjin gang has purchased a total of over a thousand dan. The standard is rising sharply. Number 8 to Number 16 is priced at 75 yuan per dan, Number 16 to Number 20 is priced at 90 yuan per dan, and Number 21 to Number 25 is around 105 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Fabric Inventory Filled to the Brim</h3>
<p>The fabric market is stable. Sales to the Austrian, Hong Kong, Wenzhou, Taiwan, Tianjin, and Qin gangs, as well as local sales, have increased slightly. Factory prices are rising, so although market inventory is abundant, the market is still strongly supported. Yesterday, all prices were flat. Spot prices for forward goods are slightly looser, around 3 jiao per piece. In this street, more than 300 pieces of white printed cloth, bleached cloth, poplin, serge, grey cloth, and coarse cloth were traded. The Kuagang gang traded more than 100 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, bleached cloth, and printed cloth. The Zhejiang-Fujian gangs traded more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, colored cloth, and clothing cloth from Lunchang, Yihua, and other factories. The North Gang traded nearly 100 cases of woven cloth, poplin, and blue cloth. Wholesale transactions of market cloth and clothing materials are quite strong in this street.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in this street, dyeing sales of Dong cloth and trading among industry players were still lively. Medium-grade trumpet white fine cloth was in greater demand, with prices continuing to rise by 2.5 jiao per piece. The market for high-grade dragon head fine cloth was volatile, with particularly large transaction volumes. The morning opening price was 26.55 yuan, once falling to 26 yuan. In the after-market closing, it rose again to 26.55 yuan. Next month's futures price requires 27.5 yuan, but major customers are unwilling to sell. Four Gentlemen Wool Serge spot prices are 7.7775 jiao per yard, and the market sentiment is very firm.</p>
<p>Exports: On the 22nd, 44 pieces were shipped to Haikou, another 54 pieces, 345 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 328 pieces to Hong Kong, and to Haiphong.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics Extraordinarily Expensive</h3>
<p>Woolen fabric ronge serge, new imports have been very scarce recently. Shanghai textiles have also reduced production due to rising raw material prices and transportation difficulties, resulting in very few wholesale transactions at present. Flannel fleece is particularly expensive, and the market is even more lacking in supply. Diagonal flower bottoms are being sold for 26 to 27 yuan per yard, while board four bottoms are 20 yuan, Renli goods are 16 to 17 yuan, Yihua power cloth is being sold for 10.05 yuan, Lixing power cloth is 12 yuan, Zheng Lun's number one black carbon lining is 4 yuan, the deputy number is 2.5 yuan, Yinfeng's number one French-style shirt is 8 jiao, the second number is 7 jiao, and Datong silk flower calico is 1.8 yuan.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Domestic Sea Dragonflies Discontinued for a Long Time</h3>
<p>Inferior Goods Flood the Market</p>
<p>Yantai sea dragonflies only arrived last autumn. Thin strips were sold for over 83 or 84 yuan. However, due to limited production and a long-term supply interruption, inferior goods have been sold in large quantities. Recently, they have been seen flooding the market. Checked box goods in paper bags of two dozen are also thin strips and must be sold for 150 to 160 yuan, which is double the price of domestic goods in the old market.</p>

<h3>The War of Life</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiayin</p>
<p>Today's Shanghai has already become a battlefield of life. Corpses are lying everywhere in the streets and alleys. These are the "soldiers" who died in the struggle for survival; some people commit suicide because of high prices and the oppression of life. These are the deserters of humanity; there are also many men, women, old and young, who are crying and hungry, waiting to be rescued. These people can be said to be our wounded soldiers; and the charitable organizations that distribute steamed buns and porridge are our ambulance teams.</p>
<p>Who are we fighting in this war of life? Are we going to keep fighting like this forever, until our children and grandchildren?</p>
<p>The soaring prices are not our real enemy, and the speculative profiteers are not our real enemy either. Our real enemy is the unreasonable social system. This deformed social system was taught to us by our muddled ancestors, and not only did the people accept it in confusion, but it seems that they will also pass it on to our descendants in confusion.</p>
<p>This unreasonable social system is caused by you, me, and him. It is the responsibility of each of us.</p>
<p>If we want to stabilize prices and enable everyone to enjoy the right to be human and a reasonable life, we must start by improving our social system.</p>
<p>Providing disaster relief and selling grain at fixed prices is like adding fuel to the fire; giving earnest advice is like playing the lute to a cow; even if we punish a profiteer, new profiteers will still emerge endlessly. Although these are all methods, they are not permanent and fundamental solutions.</p>

<h3>Brave and Lively Finnish Women</h3>
<p>— Shi Tao</p>
<p>It seems impossible for a small country, Finland, to resist the Soviet Union's invasion. However, the brave Finns are finally doing this arduous task. So far, the Finnish army is still firmly guarding its border, winning widespread sympathy from people all over the world. On the one hand, this is the reward for the hard work of the soldiers on the front line, but the active role of Finnish women after the war also has indelible merit.</p>
<p>What kind of women are there in Finland? The historian Tacitus of ancient Rome had already said in his book "Germania": "North of the Baltic Sea is a small country called Fenland (now Finland). The people there live a life of fighting against strong nature, especially the women are very brave and lively. When they go hunting with men, they insert branches into the ground and place their children in the forks of the branches. The spoils obtained are divided equally between men and women, and everything is equal between men and women!" Finnish women are not only brave and lively, but also have high education. The first country in Europe to grant women the right to vote was Finland under the rule of Imperial Russia in 1907. Currently, women account for 3,600 of the 7,000 university students in the country. It is conceivable that the level of female education is high. Therefore, women's occupations are also very common in Finnish society. From members of parliament, judges, bank clerks, doctors, and physicists to tram ticket sellers and barbers, there are women in all of them.</p>
<p>Finland is equal between men and women in occupation, education, and politics, so they cannot be exempt from sharing important responsibilities with men in the military. The Women's Volunteer Army, which was created by the First World War, is a highly organized women's group. Its mission is to supplement the deficiencies of the National Defense Army and serve in the rear during wartime; in 1719, when this group was founded, it had only 20,000 to 30,000 members, but now it has 100,000. This group does not force people to join. Among them are university students, shop clerks, and housewives. Everyone is willing to provide their special skills and time. For example, a certain female university student only has free time on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday nights, so she works for the Women's Volunteer Army during this time. Upon joining, she must first take an oath, then wear a mouse-gray uniform, and then be assigned to the wounded soldier rescue team, clothing team, fund team, education team, propaganda team, etc. When the commander of the team gives the order, they start their activities without any disorder. It is obvious that the Finnish army's difficulty in being defeated is due to this "auxiliary army."</p>
<p>Finnish women are not only lively and brave, but also, the world probably has no women who love music more than Finnish women. There are singing teams in any village, and shop clerks, telephone operators, etc. in the city will leak songs out of their mouths as long as they have free time. Finland is also a country that produces world long-distance running athletes, so they also have a strong interest in sports. In the evening, groups of girls wear Greek-style sportswear and walk in the suburban sports field to the accompaniment of moving music, reveling in Greek-style dancing.</p>
<p>There are no Finnish women who do not participate in the "Women's Volunteer" Army, and there are no women who do not join a music department or sports club.</p>

<h3>Fourteenth Dalai Lama Enthroned</h3>
<p>— Li Shaozhong</p>
<p>Today (February 22nd) is the date of the enthronement ceremony for the Fourteenth Dalai Lama of Tibet. There were three candidates for this Dalai Lama. According to custom, the decision should be made by drawing lots. However, because the six-year-old boy Lhamo Dondrub, who was found in the Jiangtuya area of Qinghai, has various solid symbols proving that he is undoubtedly the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, the Central Government specially approved the cancellation of the drawing of lots ceremony and formally appointed Lhamo Dondrub as the Fourteenth Dalai Lama. At the same time, a large delegation headed by Wu Zhongxin, a member of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, was sent to Lhasa to participate in the enthronement ceremony of Lhamo Dondrub. The National Government also allocated 400,000 yuan as the expenses for the enthronement ceremony.</p>
<p>Why does the Central Government attach so much importance to the enthronement ceremony of the Dalai Lama? Because Buddhism is the center of Tibetan society, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama hold the political and religious power of Tibet. Everything in Tibet, including politics, economy, military affairs, education, as well as writing, language, customs, and habits, has a strong Buddhist color.</p>
<p>Buddhism was founded by Prince Siddhartha Gautama of India. During the Pala Dynasty, Buddhism in India suffered great misfortune because Muslims invaded from Arabia, burned temples, and killed Buddhist followers. This prompted many Buddhists to flee to northern India, and then from the north to Tibet. Later, the Indian Buddhist scholar Padmasambhava and twenty-five disciples came to Tibet to promote Buddhism. At this time, Tibetan Buddhism could be considered formally established.</p>
<p>However, Tibetan Buddhism soon faced opposition from the Tibetan king Darma and the people, and suffered great destruction. It was not until the Indian Buddhist scholar Atisha came to Tibet to preach that Tibetan Buddhism was revived. However, after the revival, the sects were divided and fought against each other. In addition, many heretics flowed in, such as the Nyingma school and the Sakya school. Not only did they not abide by the precepts, arbitrarily kept their hair and married wives, but they were also extravagant and lascivious, and even used evil magic to confuse people, which almost brought the fate of Buddhism in Tibet to an end. At this time, Tsongkhapa, a master of reviving Buddhism, rose in Xining, Qinghai. Seeing the deteriorating situation of the various sects at that time, he decided to reform and created the Gelug school, changing to yellow robes to distinguish it from the red robes of the various sects at that time. He also revised the precepts and rejected illusionism. Seeing that marrying wives and having children to pass on the mantle was the cause of the demise of the Red Sect, Zongshi first created the theory of incarnation, that is, after death, one can reincarnate and still not lose one's nature. After Zongshi's death, his two great disciples Khedrup Je and Gyaltsab Je were stationed in Lhasa in the former Tibet and Shigatse in the latter Tibet, implementing the method of reincarnation from generation to generation to find those who inherited the position, thus laying the foundation for the power of Buddhism in both the political and religious aspects of Tibet. This is what later generations called the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama.</p>
<p>It is said that Lhamo Dondrub, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama who was enthroned this time, is very intelligent and calm and is an extraordinary child. The order issued by the National Government approving him to succeed as the Dalai Lama also said that he has "deep wisdom and extraordinary spirituality," which shows that he is an "enlightened child" who is different from ordinary people. In this enthronement ceremony, no foreigners were allowed to participate, but the Central Government specially dispatched an important delegation to Lhasa, which aroused general attention to the evolution of future policies towards Tibet. This enthronement ceremony of the Dalai Lama may open a new era in "Sino-Tibetan relations."</p>
<h3>Hoarding</h3>

<h3>Utilizing Collective Strength</h3>
<p>— Bo Hehua</p>
<p>There is a surgeon named Lewis in Los Angeles, USA. He believes that paying a monthly fee of $1.50 per person can get all medical treatment - outpatient, home visit, surgery, hospital, medicine, etc. But this requires many people to sponsor and participate.</p>
<p>Soon, 500 employees of the water and electricity company registered with him. In order to proceed smoothly, he joined forces with Dr. Ross and hired a nurse to establish the "Ross Lewis Hospital".</p>
<p>Their career is thriving. In order to offset expenses, the monthly fee has also increased to $2.50. There are ten branch hospitals in the suburbs of Los Angeles, and the number of full-time doctors has increased from two to sixty-five. Needless to say, the number of registrants has increased even more. Family members of registrants can also enjoy preferential treatment. Many doctors in other cities are imitating and establishing similar organizations.</p>
<p>We should know that this is not only beneficial to the general public, but also cost-effective for general doctors. The highest annual salary for doctors working here is $12,000, and the lowest is $3,600. The average income of doctors in California is $3,577 per year, and other expenses must be deducted.</p>
<p>Dr. Lewis said, "If it is said that this system cannot be implemented everywhere, there is no reason." And we really can't think of any reason, except for stubbornness and conservatism.</p>
<p>In our society where everything is not guaranteed, health is naturally no exception. Many people die unjustly. Is our population really too large? I don't know if there are any wise people who are willing to consider it.</p>
<p>I think this fact shows us a very good lesson. All interests must be fought for with collective strength. In this place, why are prices so high? Apart from manipulation, no other reason makes sense.</p>
<p>So, why should the majority of the people be manipulated by a few profiteers? The current living problem is heavily pressing on the hearts of every citizen. Can everyone not find a way out?</p>
<p>We can get rid of manipulation and we can have a way out. Gather the strength of the masses to establish consumer organizations and balance prices. But this requires the help and advocacy of the wise concession authorities and wise people in the community.</p>

<h3>Thoughts on the 50th Anniversary of Film</h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>Since the first creative film was publicly screened in the United States in 1891, cinema has had a full 50 years of history to this day. To celebrate this great anniversary, foreigners in this city have been preparing to launch a celebration. Details have already been reported by Xin Yingjun in this publication. Here, the writer only wants to write a few words of encouragement as a commemorative text.</p>
<p>Fifty years of history, not short but not long, but the development of film during this period is indeed very amazing. From silent films to sound films to color films to animated films, one does not know how many heroic achievements have been established in the process. Film is not only a form of entertainment, but also has a non-negligible position in education and culture.</p>
<p>Some say: "Watching a movie is like reading a good book. Similarly, it can also give us spiritual comfort and physical and mental benefits." Undoubtedly, the film industry will be further developed in the future, which is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>Every person engaged in the film business, and every film artist, on this commemorative occasion, should each observe how brilliant and bright the film industry has been in the past 50 years, and how great and amazing it has been. In order to maintain past honors, and in order to make the film industry even more perfect, everyone should strive to expand this great road of art.</p>
<p>Looking back at China's film industry, there are indeed many, many areas that need to be improved. Let's work hard. Since this year is exactly the 50th anniversary of film, let us have a general mobilization. Don't be attached to low-level, unconscious films. As long as we are willing to work hard, willing to work diligently, and willing to work practically, we will not let British and American films monopolize the beauty. I hope that when the 50th anniversary of Chinese films comes, we will truly be able to catch up to their level.</p>

<h3>Hua Lian Performs a Play</h3>
<p>— Chou Cheng</p>
<p>The Entertainment Section of the Hua Lian Trade Association held an opening ceremony for the association's newly established clinic on the 27th, inviting medical doctor Zhu Yanggao to unveil the plaque and Misses Yan Meilie and Yan Shumei to cut the ribbon. The remaining entertainment was the performance of "After Dusk". The plot takes place in the lawless area of the isolated island. Two dilapidated houses are inhabited by two unemployed workers, one is a young single man named A Mao, and the other is Chen Erwazi, who has a wife and daughter. However, due to unemployment, his wife followed Jinzui, who relied on special forces to make a living, and his daughter Cuilan was also taken away. Chen Er was forced by food and clothing to do the job of skinning field chickens at times, but A Mao was unaware of this. Five days later, Cuilan escaped back, saying that Jinzui forced her to be a foreign guide and molested her, but Jinzui chased after her, resulting in a major conflict. Chen Er was defeated and arrested. A Mao took an axe to seek revenge on Jinzui. Before leaving, he reconciled with Cuilan and they left the isolated island together. When A Mao returned, Cuilan had already committed suicide in the inner room, unable to wait. A Mao still mistakenly believed that Cuilan had left first. Chen Er, who played Chen Er, was ill and unable to take care of his wife and daughter, and had no choice but to skin field chickens to make a living, saying that although he had lost his conscience, it was better than Jinzui, who relied on special forces to harm his compatriots. A Mao, who played A Mao, was not tempted by Jinzui and was unwilling to collude with him, preferring to suffer from lack of food and clothing. The appearances were all fitting, and the dialogue was very thorough, and the audience could not help but sigh.</p>
<h3>Tarzan Finds a Son</h3>
<p>Unprecedented Grand Occasion</p>
<p>From the New Year's opening to the present, "Tarzan Finds a Son" has been a full house for every show. Because the film itself has the ability to attract audiences. The elephant herd's charge, the monkeys' assistance in battle, and the fighting between lions and tigers are all completely different from the past beast film styles, full of fresh stimulation. The president of Lax News Agency specially took a photo of the rare grand occasion of full houses for eight days and nights, preparing to send it to the United States for publicity, which made many viewers suffer, having to pre-purchase tickets a day in advance in order to have a chance to buy them on the day.</p>
<h3>Extracurricular Records of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Anecdote of a Certain Prince Performing a "Da Zuo" Play (Part 1)</p>
<p>A certain hereditary prince of the late Qing Dynasty was fond of drama from an early age. During the Tongzhi and Guangxu reigns, all members of the imperial family and nobility liked to hum a few lines of Peking opera or Kunqu opera. At that time, there were many famous actors. Not only were there good plays to listen to, but it was also very easy to ask any famous actor to teach a few plays in the capacity of a prince, and one could get the true transmission. The prince learned many plays. Whenever the residences of various princes and dukes had celebrations or birthdays, he would always be excited to perform one or two plays to satisfy his addiction to drama. When the guests saw the words "So-and-so Prince's Elegant Performance" written on the playbill, they knew it was him. In the past, the prince had a huge fortune and was accustomed to extravagant behavior, spending money like water. Therefore, whenever he performed a play, everyone, whether the major or minor actors who performed with him, as well as the managers and box keepers backstage, and even the odd-jobbers who washed faces and guarded the gate, could receive his reward. Sometimes, performing a play cost at least dozens of taels of silver. At that time, Sun Juxian's performance of a single play only cost eighty yuan, and many people thought it was unheard of, the highest price on record. Since the prince was so generous, as soon as he entered the backstage, one could hear nothing but compliments. Some greeted the prince, and some wished him well. They came in surrounded by people (servants and those who helped with eating and drinking, as usual, followed wherever he went), densely packed. That kind of style was really enviable. Who knew that after the Republic of China, the lives of the Manchus became more and more difficult. The descendants of the general princes, who were accustomed to extravagance, naturally could not immediately show their stinginess. Although the external pretense was still maintained, it could not be dropped, but the inner situation was very different from the past. The prince naturally encountered the same situation. At first, he could barely make a living, but later he could not even afford three meals a day! (184)</p>
