<h3>華軍春季出擊的秦捷</h3>
<p>隨着氣候的和暖，在相持中的中日戰局，也逐漸展開了活躍姿態；連日南北戰塲傳來一片捷音、不但直接打擊着日方拙劣支絀的政治攻勢，同時亦使艱苦卓絕的人們得到無上安慰。越打越强的自信，抗戰必勝的的言，都在這一次華軍的全綫出擊當中獲得更進一步的體騐。</p>
<p>如果軍事上的演進也可以劃分爲較小的段落的話，則此次華軍的全綫出擊，就應該算是從三月下旬綏西戰役開始的。那時候正是南京喜劇表演的前夜，人們也許對於綏西荒磧中五原臨河兩據點的克復未予以應有的注意：那却正是一九四〇年開歲以來最重要的一慕戰役。說明了日軍實力衰疲的程度，已經連什戰略上具有絕大價値的據點都無法確保。而且日軍一度潰敗之後，縱曾一再增援反攻，適足暴露其强弩之末的窘態，終於放棄了捲土重來的企圖。同時桂粵邊境的華軍則在靈山附近擊退日軍的進擾，完成桂南第二次的殲滅戰。日軍亦復無力再取戰略攻勢，其最大的技倆只是跳躍式的騷擾作戰以保護其通海的後方據點。而贛北方面則於本月四日起在南昌外圍展開反攻，前後克復奉新靖安安義向塘西山萬壽宮等重要據點，直逼南昌城郊。自十五日起晋南中條太行兩山脈間又展開壯烈激戰，日力以十萬之衆，九路進兵，分由運城安邑夏縣翼城長子長治壺關等地南犯，戰事綿延於西自茅津束至陵川的四五白里地區之問。日方用意顯什重溫其肅淸晋南山區的未償之願，然而其戰略佈置和兵力動員都不見得比已往幾次史强。兩週來的交戰，日軍於傷亡慘重之餘，已困處於遭受包圍殲滅之中，除茅津渡陵川陽城高平均經克復外，華軍的反掃蕩顯見具有充分把握。其間尤足令人振奮者，華軍突於二十三日一度攻入開封，巷戰竟日，迄今仍在城郊附近激戰。在上述幾處戰役當中，在綏西桂南是擊退日軍的進犯，贛北豫東是反攻日方的據點，在晋南則爲一掃蕩」與反掃蕩的角逐，凡此戰况，縱然在戰略性質上有所不同，其均能收穫重大戰果則毫無二致。從另一個角度來看：也就是無論日方是進攻，是退守，是從事後方的「掃蕩」，均已無往而不敗衂。這是一個重要的試騐，同時也暗示着中日戰事的最後歸趨。</p>
<p>日本自明治維新以來，在軍事上一味追蹤德國，無論士兵訓練和戰略運用，都以竭力摹倣德國爲能事，但其成果則不惟不能和德國陸軍彷彿，甚且大相逕庭。有如德國對波蘭丹麥挪威所施用的閃電戰術，在道義上縱難逃譴貢，在軍事上則不能不承認其高度成就；這種納粹產物即絕非日方那種軍隊素養和軍械配備所能學步。一一宅坂的慕僚們日夜幻想着表演東方的坦能堡奇蹟，却不想在魯南鄂北幾次具體面微的坦能堡戰役當中，被包圍殲滅的不是華軍，倒是日軍自身。這種畫虎不成的經騐，對於日閥應該是個深刻的敎訓。綜觀三年來中日戰事經過：最初日軍戰略戰術均獲成功，只有根本政略則爲失敗，例如華北及京滬的鏖戰；繼則在戰術上略能保持成功，在戰略上則爲失敗，例如去歲晋西湘北及今春粵北的戰役。但在最近一些戰局當中則每戰輒敗，無論戰略戰術均無絲毫成就，其軍事運用已與其征服中國的願望背道而馳。然而這並夫促成日閥的悔禍，反到轉而妄想以政治濟軍事之窮。其實那一政治攻勢仍舊要靠軍事實力來支撑。只是那衰敝的日軍並小能替日閥掙一點面子，打幾個勝仗以資點綴，反而以接三連四的敗績迎接來華的阿部「特使」，正有如去秋湘北日軍之以慘敗迎接西尾坂垣一樣。固然，目前華軍只是全綫出擊，還不到總反攻的時機，日軍也許還另有新的花樣在待機而施。但是日閥所有的可能戰略，已經沒有一個不是幾經嘗試而終遭失敗，只有其在桂南的冒險算是二期抗戰中的唯一例外，却也絲毫不能挽救日軍全盤的頹勢。華軍目前這種出擊，日方已有招架不來之勢，則他日之事可知—自然華方也應力袪因勝而驕或輕敵的流弊—即使把中國在政治經濟外交各方的有利條件都置諸玫慮之外，單從軍事來看，前途也儘可樂觀。這不是空想，而是南北戰塲中中國健兒用血肉寫成的結論。</p>

<h3>聯軍誓必堅苦作戰　為挪威民族謀解放　英航空大臣賀爾廣播演說　斥里賓特羅甫言論為可鄙</h3>
<p>倫敦　英空軍大臣賀爾頃發表廣播演詞、以答覆德外長里賓特羅甫之言論、謂余所可言者、英國曾陰謀侵犯中立國之說、乃至可卑鄙之讕言、而此讕言出於滅亡捷克波蘭者之口、尤令人聞之作噁、里賓特羅甫乃冒險倖進之陰險人物、在公共事務中、遺害甚深、正人君子未有重視其言者、而無所徧私之中立國人亦不信其言、吾人姑置其讕言於不顧、而轉言希特勒與里賓特羅甫在挪威所行之罪惡、彼等以挪威爲戰塲、强迫吾人作戰於新陣綫吾人接受其挑戰、吾人必須在此方面以吾人所能發展之物力與否人所能集合之人物與敵方相周旋、吾人幸勿抱何幻想、今之戰爭已入於緊張重要之階段、敵方將盡力作戰無所顧忌、亦不予吾人以休息、希特勒旣悍然不顧一切、將安居數世之挪威人民、拖入戰爭、希特勒對於挪威忠勇人民自不稍顧惜、至於吾人則不欲仿行之、吾人不欲溺斃無援之海員，亦不欲轟炸不設防之城鎭、更不欲以恐怖德國婦孺之手段擊敗德人、但吾人亦不欲使希特勒獨佔精力技能、與決心上之優勢、吾人必將表示吾人此種特質、遠超出希氏所表示者之上、吾人毫不注意希氏所作之任何威脅、吾人現負有必須完成之責任、協的軍必須逐步奪回德人掌握中之挪威口岸與空軍根據地、且必須以可將敵人逐至山谷港灣外之利器與戰力、置諸被侵略的挪戚人民之掌握中、但吾人當前工作、如詳言之、逈非易事、此非一朝一夕無所犧牲而可完成者、吾人今必須苦戰、以猛進的行動與堅忍的計畫、奪回德以其卑鄙可恥的打擊而獲之優點云、</p>
<p>賀爾繼向挪威人民發言謂、世界最大之英國海軍·世界最强之法國陸軍。與世界技術最精勇氣最銳之英法空軍、今爲爾輩解放之擔保人、吾人在貴國國王哈康七世所給予之英勇領導中歡忭無量、而在哈康王之側者、有伊文斯海軍大將焉、其人擁護挪英兩民族同樣愛護之海上傳統制度、英國統治海洋、而挪威則恃海爲生、挪威自由與英國將來之繫於海者、今後將使之愈臻穩固、挪威海岸砲壘已爲英國海軍之助、而英國海軍亦予敵方以莫可掩飾之打擊、那維克一役、不獨以勇敢著、且收全效、德艦隊躱避不遑、悉遭摧毀、縱挪威戰局、他事或尙未定、然此役確爲已得之結果、德海軍今不復爲主要戰具·敵方旣喪其許多軍艦、英國乃更自由調用其船隻、以應付戰略與國防上需要、英國海陸空軍在過去半月中、亦有極好成績、並表示其轟炸敵方在期堪的那維亞半島各根據地之驚人能力、斯達文格·克利斯丁森、阿爾波·奧斯陸·特隆漢·與西原等各空軍根據地皆遭轟炸、而予重大損毀、此乃英空軍在猛烈反抗中所造成之功績、英空軍今後且準備擔任更大之工作、英政府決不稍懈其在海上與天空佔據優勢之決心、而英國朝野亦皆決計必達此目的、今日飛揚於北冰洋之英國威力、終將以自由人民之榮譽與高尙主義之勝利使吾人復覩和平云、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<h3>對德外長演辭　各國觀感</h3>
<p>巴黎　據此間接獲各處電訊、德外長里賓特洛浦所發表之演說、除義大利照例加以好評外、其他如匃牙利·荷蘭·比利時各國人士莫不嗤之以鼻、此在匈牙利政界人士謂、該國僅注意其本國利益、里賓特洛浦之演詞、旣未涉及東南歐洲、自不必十分重視之、此外、比荷兩國人士咸謂、里賓特洛浦此舉用意、殆欲向該國人民證明、此次出兵北歐、實具有充分理由、惟是渠所發表之白皮書、亦即指摘英法兩國早已準備侵犯挪威者是否確實、仍屬可疑耳云、（二十八日哈互斯社電）</p>
<p>掩飾侵略欲蓋彌彰</p>
<p>倫敦　德外長里賓持羅甫之言論、與德國最近白皮書之發表、皆未引起此間官塲之驚異、德國對共擴張所謂保護勢力之任何國家、輒發現許多重要不利於該國之文件、此種令人驚愕之事實、徒供人笑話耳、（二十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　今日各著名星期日報紙、均著論駁斥德外長里賓特羅甫昨日在柏林廣播講說中所發協約國計畫、侵犯挪威之言論、觀察報外交訪員聲稱、現時欲駁斥里氏之言論、已無追述過去事實之必要、因德國以外之人民均熟知之也、目前有一可注意之問題、即里氏何以邀請外交團聆其演說是、大的里氏之用意、係欲藉此以堅國內人民之信任而已、星期日泰晤士報載稱、各中立國對於里氏之妄造英國早有侵犯挪威準備、以爲具攻挪之藉口、自未必輕予置信、因事實固勝於雄辯也、里氏遵沿德國最卑劣之傳統手段、企圖以罪名加諸挪威、其情形與上决大戰時之對比利時完全相同、其實此兩無辜國家皆嚴格遵守中立、德國均利用其中立而侵犯之、事後又以莫須有之罪加之、以掩飾其自己之行爲、里氏言論中之最愚蠢者、莫過於謂協約國各政治家陰謀奪取挪威、如引證英外相哈里法克斯曾警告各中立國勿於時機渦晚之時、請求英國之援助、哈氏確曾如此、惟未以任何英國相威嚇、哈氏所預料與述及者均爲德方行動之威脅、今日此事豈尙不足說明其預料之準確乎、里氏其餘之引證、皆能如是解釋之云、（廿八日路透電）</p>
<p>認係針對瑞典而發</p>
<p>巴黎　德國外長里賓特洛浦所發表之演說、此間政界人士頃加以評論云、此項演說、顯係對瑞典而發、內容對於挪威大肆攻擊、對於瑞典則盛加稱道、實屬別有用心、此與一九三八年九月問捷克祟變期間、德國一方面攻擊捷克、而另一方面則以聯絡波蘭爲事、初無二致、時至此際、德國對於斯堪的那維亞半島所採取之策略、亦復相同、緣德國諗知瑞典業已採取各種預防措置、倘若貿然進攻、必受極大困難、爰欲安慰瑞典國使其疏於防範、甚至將一部份陸軍復員、則他日進攻瑞典、必易於收效、此外里賓特洛浦外長演詞、對於百分之白被侵略丹麥、却避不道及、亦可注意云、（廿七日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>義大利竟為德張目</p>

<p>羅馬　德國政府所發表之白皮書及挪威特隆漢港戰事消息、頃由此間各報予以轉戰、其評論斯堪的那維亞半島戰事時、對於英法兩國所處地位均持極悲觀之論調、並欲使一般讀者相信英法兩國對於各中立國壞有侵略意向、從而表出德義兩國之聯帶關係、業已較爲具體化、（二十八日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>德重施廿年前故技</p>
<p>挪威　芝加哥德外長里賓特洛浦昨日听發表之演說、頃由挪威駐美公使摩根斯蒂納加以辨正稱、德國此次侵略挪威、與一九一四年時該國軍隊侵入比利時如出一轍、溯自歐戰發生以來吾國始終嚴守中立、前當吾國中立地位迭受侵犯時、吾人曾向英法德二國同時提出抗議、德輔助艦「阿爾脫馬克」號及美貨船「弗林特城」號兩案即其明證、里賓特洛浦所謂挪威曾與某國有何陰謀之說、當可不攻自破云、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>美反侵略立場不變</p>
<p>美國　華盛頓關於德外長里賓特洛浦所發表之「戲劇化的演說」、此間政界人士頃加以評論云、美國對於任何侵略行動、向抱譴責中義、決非一席話所得變更、美國在現行歐戰中所處地位、業已由羅斯福總統於本月十三日發表演說時予以說明、至於里賓特洛浦所謂英國海軍部對於侵略挪威國、早已擬就計劃云云此說不値一哂、無待駁斥云、（廿七日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>蔑視理智又一表演</h3>
<p>紐約　紐約通報稱、昨日德外長里賓特羅甫對挪威所發之言論、實爲施於全世界之理智之一種侮辱、紐約時報載稱、全世界在一方面之英挪與另一方面屢决食言之德國間、將知如何加以選擇云、聖魯易斯郵報亦謂里賓特羅甫已作一次蔑視一切理智之表演云、（二十八日路透社電）</p>
<h3>不啻殺人犯之自辯</h3>
<p>紐約　德外長里賓特洛浦昨日之演說、頃由今晨各報加以評論、紐約泰晤士報稱、「此種純粹戲劇化的說法、苟欲求其解釋、可於希特勒元首在對挪威宣戰前數小時所發表之鄭重演說中得之、質言之、德國企圖摧毀挪威國抗戰力量、但此種野蠻舉動業已失敗、里賓特洛浦外長因此不得小發表昨日之演說、以諉卸責任、如是而已、總之「誠信」一字現已　生動搖、世人今後在英法兩國所作諾言、及德國所作諾言之問、當知有所抉擇矣」紐約講壇報則以「殺人者之辯護」爲題略謂「希特勒欲吾人承認此項辯解、俾對於一國向其他一國所犯之彌天大罪視爲止當、是烏乎可」云、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德軍活動用意叵測　瑞典戒備不懈　未能因德宣言而釋疑</h3>
<p>瑞典京城　瑞典爲預防攻擊起見、現已施行種種戒備計劃、而遏止外人間諜之活動、即其一端、外人僅許乘公共舟車旅行、且有許多地方不許外人涉足、國內防衛隊業已成立、拘捕張降落傘自空躍下者、亦爲其職責之一、全國各處顯皆有空襲預防、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>瑞典京城　德國報紙近常斥責瑞典、以爲即就瑞典報紙言論觀之、瑞典並木遵守如德國所期望嚴格中立、乃德外長里賓特羅甫昨忽發德國對於瑞典與中立地位與中立行爲認爲滿意之言論、瑞典人士聞之、殊以爲怪、德國旣以瑞典中立爲滿意、然則德國在波羅的海外米美爾及其他東普魯士口岸之軍事準備、及德機在瑞典上空之時常出現、用意果何在乎、故瑞典人士不能因德外長之一言而釋疑也、若干方面以爲德國關於瑞典之言論、殆爲蘇聯而發、因蘇聯已聲明蘇聯對於挪威之事件與丹麥之被佔、固願以旁觀者自居、但若涉及瑞典、則蘇聯將不得已而有干涉也、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<h3>英機從未轟炸　不設防城市　德宣傳具有作用</h3>
<p>倫敦　此間負責方面稱、德國無綫　台現又散佈英機轟炸非軍事目標之謊言、德方技倆早已爲人共知、其所以造此謠言者、無非準備實施其歸罪於英國之轟炸舉動耳、其實英機從未有轟炸不設防城邑或非軍事目標之情事云、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>阿姆斯特丹　據此間所聞德方宣傳　局本週杪曾通告各報紙、加緊其斥責英方轟炸挪威與德國不設防城邑之運動、蓋欲造成一種輿情、庶德國可隨時以報復行動加諸英國也、（二十八日路透電）</p>

<h3>兩性醫學　腰痠背痛健忘失眠的嚴重性及其治法</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科　畢業楊道南醫師著</p>
<p>關於腰痠背痛的發生，由於操勞過度而來者，亦佔多數，此由於全身的各部組織，因操勞過度之故，遂漸損壞，直至不堪使用程度——因此爆發了本症。</p>
<p>此外由於縱慾荒淫而來者，以中年人患者爲最多。蓋縱慾而把精血消耗過度，新陳代謝之機能滅弱，形成米老先衰之象，腦，腎，脊髓三大部分病態百出。腰痠背痛，不過衰弱中之一種症狀而已，全身各部幾成百虛，如遺精，滑精，腦弱失眠，健忘等症，包羅殆盡，此誠嚴重之至！</p>
<p>精力弱頽，縱情聲色的人大都難逃上述各症，精神不振，腦力尤爲遲鈍，凡遇事物，即不能注意，以致成爲隨見隨忘，意識溷濁，精神上至感痛苦，若不從速治療，難保不促短壽命。</p>
<p>上述的幾種疾病，總而言之，不是神輕衰弱者，決不會這樣的。欲研究其主要病根，先得於靑春時化，勿犯手淫，蓋手淫之後，靑春腺爲之毀壞，遺精難免，使全身的精液枯竭·直接影響到全身的康健·尤其以意淫爲害尤烈，蓋意淫只憑不自然的空想，將全部集中於一點，所以非常容易使注意力·推想力衰弱·故靑年犯有上述之惡癖者，須從速戒絕之。</p>
<p>少壯時代一有上述各症，幸福全無，治療之法，必須根本設想，根本治療的方法，先要將靑春腺恢復原狀，然後新陳代謝的機能旺盛，血液也可以充足，腦力也就活潑了，記憶力自然增强，余爲性病之專科醫師，深知靑春腺素製劑之最佳者，以「補體康」爲第一，良由「補體康」除雄壯動物之靑春腺素之外，並有補腦之燐質，補血之鐵質，補骨之鈣質摻入，分男女用兩種，女用功能調經種子，治貧血早衰，乳癟失健，最爲對症。</p>

<p>宋時岳武穆有句很雄壯的豪語，就是「直搗黃龍」，黃龍是金國的根據地，將他消滅，才是根本的辦法，可惜功敗垂成。千古惋惜：這是表明凡是要成功，必須根本解決以淋病而言，淋病患者往往以病患暫時隱伏，遂毫不去注意牠，一切行動，與未患病時無異；而結果所屆，時發時愈，病勢愈來愈壞，而至不可收拾故善治淋病者，必善治其根，而淋病之根又必須剷除，凡是再復之病，必共病根未除，而淋病之一再復發者，尤其如此。故余以爲要求淋病表面上一時隱伏，並非難事。而所難者，在於如何可以直搗病菌巢穴耳。幸而現在科學有高速度之發展，對於此等難題確獲安全之解決。原來德國淋病學大師彼德博士，以三十餘年之經騐，發明採用蛋白體黃色素混合製劑「克淋儂」（中英大藥房售），此劑歷年來經世界各大著名醫師實騐證明其有實效。效力超過一切平凡的化學療法，因此劑旣參用非特異性療法之原理，繼續改良而成功者。其效力能於服後數小時內，發生抗淋噬菌作用，不論初起時的淋病，和慢性淋的淋病，皆可迅速根治。這因爲淋菌繁殖力雖繁，逃竄的地方雖多，終是敵不過「克淋儂」效力，能直接扑減淋菌巢穴，宛如天羅地網，決難倖逃漏網的。所以一經「克淋儂」治愈的淋病，從無再發之事，更無失敗之例。至於外用藥方面，男子可外用「抗淋水」按圖與說明書自行洗滌尿道，女子可外用「卡而雪地陰道片」爲坐藥，每晚於臨睡挿入一片，决晨洗去卽得，則其功效，尤爲完備迅速。</p>
<h3>遺精腎虧治愈例</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士　鄭霆</p>
<p>患者閔雲山，浙江蕭山人，年廿四歲，住上海東唐家弄，於去秋來余處診治，所患如下，十八歲結婚，身體非常衰弱，况於未婚前染有手淫，婚後雖得戒絕，然肌肉削瘦，精神萎頓，遺精仍發，房事早洩，有時勃起力不大堅强，大有見色流精，腎虧已達極點。（診時病狀）——脈搏一〇九次，聽音時時不同，頭痛，耳鳴，遺精症狀嚴重，體重九十三磅，故結婚七年尙未生育。且閔君在日間若操勞過度，卽有精液頃刻滑出，目倦無神，頭髮稀疏，所患之神經衰弱症甚烈。（治療方法）——每日爲之電療十五分鐘，面授攝生要法，投以靑春腺素製劑男用「補體康」以培補虧損，增進其腎部的繁榮，消滅其神經衰弱症，使之重獲發育，同時於睡前投服「耐而斯遺精片」三片，以鞏固精關，止其遺精，連服三月，閔君諸症全消，身體壯健，軀幹漸形結實，體重突增七磅，足證「補體康」之治效，確有特殊之成續。</p>
<h3>咳嗽症的嚴重</h3>
<p>— 盛在强需師</p>
<p>咳嗽之症，最易使人輕忽，原因是咳嗽患者，以其一時並無若何危篤之現象可怕，所以一直就延宕下來，而咳嗽也就愈演愈凶，馴致不可挽救。</p>
<p>從眞正的病理上而言，咳嗽乃肺部排除外界侵入不良份子，正是一種抵抗禦侮的表示，若是用麻醉劑反而减低抵抗力，以余二十餘年之經騐，並參考各國醫家實騐報錄，惟德國徒梅博士所發明之肺病特效藥「補肺拿爾」一藥功效最著，不論如何頑固難愈，或將成癆之咳嗽，服「補肺拿爾」後能於三小時內，收鎭咳化痰之功，補肺防癆，其功遠居魚肝油之上，此爲各國醫家所證明者</p>
<h3>淋病新語　尿道淋之前因後果</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師撰</p>
<p>診所：寗波路　九號四川路口</p>
<p>一染淋病，其初之淋菌，類多寄生於前尿道，此時如果以迅雷不及掩耳之法，將淋菌加以掃蕩，則未獲據點之淋菌，自無從掙扎，而一網打盡，惟是，如果此時而不極力消滅此種病菌，則一切病變均由此而起。大抵前尿道之淋菌，淋病之前驅期中常見之。及由前驅而入急性期，則淋菌已不侷促於前尿道而且路入後尿道，一切變症，更見增多，而治療上亦較前驅症爲難。淋菌在前尿道所發生之淋病，其易扑滅之原因，爲因前尿道生理上無複雜的搆造。所以治療起來，很是容易，如果淋菌已侵入後尿道，治療上雖較難，但如其淋菌尙未侵襲泌尿器系，內生殖器系，血液循環系，根治猶不甚難，但如果已成淋毒性膀胱炎，攝護腺炎，睪丸炎，關節炎等症，是無異表明患者之淋病已侵入此等系統。其治療上不但較前尿道炎爲難，卽後尿道炎亦困難多矣。凡此等等，都是淋毒尿道炎失治之前因後果。而惟一之療法，祗有服用淋病特效藥化學療法「克淋儂」（中英大藥房均售）始有肅淸之望。因淋菌如其自前尿道。迄分散三大系統之淋菌，範圍廣大，絕對不能用一枝一節之局部手術，可以完成驅淋之任務也。余更輔用德國靜電療法，使「新克淋儂」殺菌力尤能發揮盡致診時：上午十時至下午六時。自卽日起每日送診廿號。每號僅取號金五角並送價値一元之「性病全書」一冊。</p>

<h3>猪隻缺貨　肉業停市</h3>
<p>本市公共租界暨法租界各肉舖、昨晨因無貨應市、入停止營業狀態、探悉、每日滬市需要猪隻三千頭、因邇來南通一帶、產猪區遭日方壟斷、捐稅重重、漫無限止、運滬殊感困難、於是一般猪販、以無利可圖、相繼輟業、本埠來源日見稀少、前日各猪行祇有八九百頭、且兩租界肉舖林立、平均分配、一家一頭、亦不敷殊甚、蓋越界築路區域、如曹家渡一帶店舖、閃在特殊範圍之內、依舊得如數供給、而以所剩之二十餘頭、分配於兩租界肉舖、此區區之數、難以應市、惟有閉門停業、總之、現下貨價成本、突飛猛漲、即使有貨色銷、亦必虧蝕過鉅、不若停業後之僅損失開支而已、據悉、昨日市價、每元最多購十兩、甚致七八兩不一、即同業批拆、亦祇有每元市秤一左右、此次停業、完全係缺貨所致、今日能否照常應市、須視來源、</p>

<h3>不堪回首之南市</h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>南市在戰前，居民鱗次櫛比，市廛相當繁盛。自國軍西撤後，除北區一部份，由饒神父籌設難民區，作爲安全地帶，其房屋雜物，組保完整外，餘則居民逃避一空，雜物搜刦殆盡，敗屋頹坦，觸目皆是，撫今視昔，大有不勝滄桑之感。爰將記者目睹耳聞者，誌於后：</p>
<p>敗屋頹垣　淒涼一片</p>
<p>日軍進據南市後，地方人士之稍負時望者，均相率走避，地痞流棍，乘時蠭起，與日軍打成一片，四處放火延燒，綿亘二星期之久，烈焰猶木熄滅。故除難民區外，稍稱完整者，僅老西門口之和平路，肇嘉路，中華路，小南門暨大南門口，寥寥可數之幾處市房而已。餘如十六舖外灘外馬路起，沿東門路方浜路之南中華路，東街四牌樓，光啟路，三牌樓，大東門，肇嘉路，老馬路，裏外鹹瓜街，小西門外之車站路，陸家浜，製造局路，斜土路，徽寗路，高昌廟一帶，悉成焦土，敗屋頹垣，迄今猶觸目皆是，一片荒凉景象，令人不忍卒睹。而大南門之海潮寺，圖書公司原址新陸村，小東門之福安公司，車站　之普益習藝所，蓬萊路之萊市塲，文廟公園圖書館，民衆敎育館，也是園，動物園等，亦均爲此次殘酷砲火所燬棄。車站路之地方法院，本尙巋然獨存於焦土之中，由日軍小川部隊佔據，自從撤退以後，不知如何起火，亦焚燒　　，現僅存門前房屋一埭，似不屑冉供人棲止者。</p>
<p>鐵軌電桿　多被搜括</p>
<p>南火車站，自日軍侵入南市後，被作爲兵站，所有鐵軌枕木及交通信號等設備，自南車站至龍華一段，均被日軍拆去。沿城電桿木，除難民區及民國路一帶依然無恙外，餘則一無所見。即電車路上敷設之銅絲，亦僅存自小東門至方浜橋一段。所有交通，火車當然斷絕，雷車與公共汽車，自與淪陷相終始，絕跡市上。最近南市開放後，始有所謂「華中汽車公司之成立，置備汽車八輛，分爲二綫：一繞民國路環行，一自老西門沿斜土路至日暉港，然以居民稀少，乘客亦甚寥寥。至人力車，在初陷落時，不過數十輛，嗣後逐漸增加，迄今已有一千一百餘輛。至原有電車之馬達，悉被日方拆去，僅破舊車身，殘留廠內。</p>
<p>被佔水電　不敷開支</p>
<p>華商電力公司之引擎機件，悉被一華中水電林式會社」所佔用，經其修　後仍在原處發電，而其營集部，則佔用老西門之上海銀行舊址。自來水水源，亦仍取給於半淞園路內地自來水廠，設「水道管理處」於和平路新華銀行舊扯。聞兩項收入，每月約在六萬元左右，區區之數，尙不足應敷開支，可見居戶蕭條，市廛冷落，以致雖有供給，而乏　應用也。</p>
<p>自稱局所　五光十色</p>
<p>自日軍侵入南市後，所有國民政府下之正式公署局所，均經遷移辦公，現竟居然有目　「區公署」者，以沈世景爲「區長」，設於尙文小學內。有「法院」者，以嚴掄魁爲「院長」，設於蓬萊路西成小學內。有「南市警察分局」者，以王芝章爲「局長」，設於中華路小南門縣商會內。有一邑廟警察分局」者，以朱家麟爲「局長」，設於小東門方浜路慶雲銀樓內，「斜橋警察分局」者，以金殿揚爲「局長」，設於製造局路麗園路口洋房內。有「偵緝隊」者，以趙永盛爲」隊長」，均各設於「警局」附近。又有「　　救國軍總部」者，以陳範爲「總司令」，雷爲民爲「副司令」，設於中華路西首鶴嗚里內。有「靑年團目衛隊　部」者，設於尙文小學內。餘如所謂「公用局車捐處」，「財政局捐務處」，均設於文廟路民立女子中學內。眞如五光十色，無奇不有。</p>
<p>日軍稀少　偽警混充</p>
<p>日軍爲應付各處流動戰，整個南市，殊鮮踪跡，即有少數，亦皆駐防於外日暉港豐林橋龍華一帶，僅設憲兵隊部於蓬萊路前上海市警察局內，幷在民國路，新開河，（即前無綫電報局）露香園路口，南陽橋，斜橋等五處，設立「憲兵派出所」。又另設所謂「憲佐隊」，其中隊員，悉中偽警中選充，附於憲兵隊內，助理憲兵任務。</p>
<p>虎狠當道　遍地荊棘</p>
<p>所謂「軍警」者，貌似　非，白畫虛應故事，掩人耳目，入夜銷聲匿迹，不見踪影，旣不站崗，亦不巡邏，因此宵小蠭起，竊盜橫行。甚至　警察搜查爲名，公然闖入人家，翻箱倒篋，搜抄財物之事，時有所聞，於是整個治安，毫無保障。雖開放南市，任人居住，希圖遷避市民，安返家園，徒成一種夢想。且有多數房產業主，遍貼通告，限令房客繳付房租，而房客亦以市面未臻恢復，實在無力繳付，咸抱觀望態度。</p>
<p>自甘失學　別求職業</p>
<p>他如郵局，曾一度停頓，始於去年三月間恢復畫錦路，老西門二處，然以僅遞送郵件，匯票不開。至於敎育，僅有中學一所，所謂「特別市市立第二中學，」設於尙文小學內。小學五所，悉借養正，倉基，梅溪，紫金，珠玉業等舊址開學。以此偌大區域，僅有郵局二處，中學一所，小學五所，居民咸稱不便。然以敎育都成奴化，儘有許多子弟，自甘失學，拋棄寳貴光陰，別找職業者，可知血氣靑年，實通處此，亦非全無志氣也</p>

<h3>南市基督徒所辯的　自主工藝工作概況</h3>
<p>南市基督教徒所辦的自助工藝，開辦以來，已有兩年光景，雖然知道的人還不十分多，可是他們的工作，對於難民却有很大的意義。這種自助運動的中心工作，稱爲「慈善工藝，」以工賑來替代「坐吃」。也就是利用各個人的一技之長，變單純的消費，爲循環的生產；帶有自助助人，和相互合作的精神，在自力更生之中，尋求生活之路。</p>
<p>一種運動的推進，無論原則如何元美，制度如何週密，辦事的人如何努力；要是得不到各方面的贊助，和經常的維持，那沒很難有所成就。基督敎徒自助運動今日在南市稱得初步基礎者，一方面固然要歸功於這種工賑運動者的大力量，但另一方面，也未始不是社會上一部份熱心贊助者所　成</p>
<p>據總秘書蓬氏，最近三個月來的工作報告，　稱自從南市鐵鬥開放以來，返回故居的人逐漸多起來，粗手工藝和小商業也開始在恢復之中。所難解決的，貧乏的人繼續着非常的普遍，自助工藝所能給予工作者的微細工資，渴需的人數以千百計算，眞有粥少佾多之概。</p>
<p>贊助自助救濟的熱心人士，本埠和國外都有，可是單位不多，亟有推廣的必要。譬如送出去的「慈善袋」共有四百隻，而每月所收到的衣服和零星東西，實際上只有百把隻。這些數量，無論如何是，不敷應用的，如果要增加工藝品的產銷兩者的話。</p>
<p>各方捐助該團體的東西，範圍尙廣，有各種製造上的原料，藥品，衣服和食品等。本年開始以來的三個月中，以各種東西折合現款來算，的値華幣五，一一九，五〇元。其中包括棉紗，饅頭，藥品魚肝油，衣服，煤斤等，有些工廠到於他們採購原料時，給以優待的辦法。</p>
<p>本年春季，華方人士和團體等共捐助九九一·三七元；三十位西人捐助六九一、八五元；國外熱心人士寄來三·四六一·六二元。該團體工塲出品和園藝品出售所得，每月約一，一七三·〇〇元。每個月的總收入，加入敎會基金在內，約共五，〇〇〇元，開支約四，八〇〇元。</p>
<p>各種工作，常以原料的供應程度，和時令關係或輟或興。最近他請了連友三君爲職員，預備對各項工作加以擴展，如機器織襪　，他們已有織機上部，但希望工人們能自己購買機器。</p>
<p>靈性上的修養，也是他們對於工人們的一種貢獻。早晚禮拜，幾乎全部職工都參加。主日由張君講道，已受湯牧師施洗的工人計二十一名。主日學校的主持人員，對於兒童佈道，尤爲熱心。</p>
<p>除了上面的工賑之外，他們對於病人和赤貧者，都給以救濟，施以食品，衣服，藥物或現金，計施出衣服七四四件，毅一八〇七斤，現款九四，九〇元。對於工人生病或分娩，尤爲注意。</p>
<p>受免費醫病的人，在這一季中共四〇〇〇人，兒童所患的，以眼病，皮膚病和虱患爲最多，此外對於兒童及嬰孩等又不時予以沐浴的便利。</p>
<p>工人們的兒女在他們那里受敎育的約二百二十人，他們得免費進午膳，由於敎師們的注意，這班難童的身體和紀律都有顯著的進步。他們還辦了一個託兒所，結果女工們工作的成績增進，而小孩子們的身體也格外康健了。</p>
<p>「自助救濟」的曰的，在使一班尙可自食其力的男女，獲得相當的技巧和製造原料，漸漸的使他們能够謀生。因之這自主工　團體，一方面請具有專門技　的人教授工作，使難民養成具有生產的能力；一方面以工資付予能够工作的人，使他們糊口。</p>
<p>他們常以每天的一頓或兩頓膳食，作爲工作者的工資。自一月初至三月底，供給工人和童工的飯食共二四，一二三頓。平均每餐的價値爲兩角，幸而他們自己有園地，蔬菜的供給，在二月與三月間，倒很充足。在這三個月中間又售出豆腐漿三、六三六碗，每碗收錢一分。</p>
<p>這時期中所僱用的工人，平均爲二百五十人，其中四十名爲男性，二個敎師，和各部份的助手，十個小販—支取熟練工人工資，幾個廚子和非熟練工人。女工大多爲非熟練者，連飯食在內，每月可得工資十元五角，此種女工共一百七十四名。熟練工人四十六名，月支十五元六角，十九元二角者三人，二十一元二角者二人。但實際上工人所獲之利益尙不止此，因若輩大多可得免費醫病，免費敎育，若十衣服，並供給工人之小孩以飯食。每日工作時間，僅五小時半。春季中之工作日數爲一六·八四六天，工人因病或分娩者，工資照給。</p>
<p>自助工藝之僱工，大概爲敎書，工塲中之工頭，文書，助醫，烹調，煮水及提水，靑嬰，洗滌，燙衣，染色，紡織，紡紗，彈棉花，分理布片，紮拖帚，織氈，縫紉，縫鞋底，做布鞋，補皮鞋，做草鞋，木工，油漆用具及玩具，其他零星工作如裱畫，釘簿，製麵，磨穀，負販，織襪及園藝等</p>

<p>經濟專刋　第一三七期</p>
<h3>經濟專刊</h3>
<p>— 高重伯</p>
<p>上海之有租界，肇端於鴉片戰爭後南京條約；距今不過九十七年。其先有英租界，美租界，法租界，之別。民國紀元前十年，英·美·兩租界合併爲公共租界。於是上海租界乃包含公共租界，與法租界，之總稱。歷年人口之增加，及市政之進步，已成爲世界著名商埠之一，形成我國商業金融之集散中心。値此非常時間與特殊環境下，租界之財政，當然困難重重。乃以公債彌補不足。吾人姑就歷史上，及數字下，研究上海租界公債之概况，想亦經濟界同志所樂聞者歟。</p>
<p>（一）前後發行總額幾何　公共租界發行銀兩公債一起，國幣公債叫起。共國幣四千七百二十二萬九千九百四十五元。法租界發行銀兩公債十一起，國幣公債　一起。共國幣二千五百七—四萬零八百三十九元。兩租界，共負公債，七千二百九十七萬零七百八十四元。</p>
<p>（二）最早發行與最後償還　法租界，在民國紀元前一年，最先發行公債。公共租界在民國十五年，開始徵募公債。</p>
<p>公共租界公債，以一九六七年爲最後償還期；法租界公債，以一九六四年爲最後償還期</p>
<p>（三）公債市價之高低　公共租界公債以一九二六年度，每白現售九十元爲最高。一九三七年度，每百現售七十六元，為最低。法租界公債以一九一一年度，每百現售一百零一元半，爲最高。一九三四年度，每百現售七十三元，爲最低。大旨以利率高低爲升降。</p>
<p>茲再將兩租界歷年公債之內容。與最近公共租界慕集　千六百萬元公偵。分述於左：</p>
<p>公共租界工部局所募公債</p>
<p>（一）一九二六年，六厘規銀公債，尙欠四百八十八萬兩。每年以六月，十二月，爲付息期。時値每百兩售九十兩。預定一九五六年以前，全部還淸。</p>
<p>（二）一九三四年，五厘銀　公債，一千零四十萬四千七百元。原定一九四四年至一九六四年間還本。每年以六月，十二月，爲付息期。時値每百元售七十七元。</p>

<h3>漫談紗價（上）</h3>
<p>— 馬兆榮</p>
<p>這裏所談的紗價，並不是紗價的漲落；而是價格的高低。同一樣的紗支，爲甚麼　金城，雙馬等牌售價持高出衆呢？尤其是特金城。這與紗的質量和廠譽有關了。</p>
<p>紗的品質如何判斷呢？下面是幾個主要條件：一，拉力即强力）二，條俗，三，色澤，四，撚度。拉力人，條格勻凈，色澤白，撚度適中，　樣的紗，便是品　好的紗。反之，品質便次劣了。</p>
<p>紗的拉力是甚麼意思呢？拉力就是拉斷紗的力量。在這力的限度以內施力於其上，它是不會切斷的。越　這力，它便不能支持而切斷了。所以紗的拉力大，是一般購買者的要求。</p>
<p>大的拉力旣是買者所共求，製造者可以盡量提高了。但是拉力的提高與製造者的製迆成本有關，所以各廠所出的紗拉力都不同。</p>
<p>紗的拉力爲甚麼有大小呢？這與原料，給撚，機器，管理有關了。紗的原料是棉花，棉花的纖維是長短不同的。長的纖維比短的質地好，用來紡紗拉力人。但是因爲質地好，所以價格高。價格高，紗的成本便人了，因此原料方面的品質爲了成本關係也受了限制。普通紡紗纖維的長度標準大概如下：十六支以下，八分之七吋。十七—二六支，一吋。二七—三六支，一又十六分之一吋。三七—四四支，一又八分之一吋。四五—五二支，一又十六分之一吋。五三—六一支，一又四分之一吋。六一—七〇支，一又十六分之五吋。七一—七八支，一又八分之三吋。七九—八五支，一又十六分之七吋。八六—一〇〇支，一又二分之一吋。</p>
<p>一方面原料的價格要盡量减低，一方面還要充分的提高拉力。這件困難的事，就要有頓於紡織技術家了。紡績技術家常常採取各種纖維的特質，用數種適合的原棉配合起來，這樣可以顧到成本並可提高拉力。</p>
<p>至於給撚，在普通情形之下，多一點拉力可大一些。可是太多也不適宜，紗條皺硬。</p>
<p>說到機器對於拉力也很有影響。新的機器要比舊的紡得好。皮圈式大牽伸比普通機子好。因爲紡出的紗，條格均勻，所以拉力大。</p>
<p>管理呢？也有相當影響。如果工人在工作時不依工作程序及工作法去做，或溫濕度調劑不適，或各機　伸（抽長）分配得不當，紡出的紗無疑地拉力要差些。</p>
<p>拉力的大小如何測定呢？紗廠的方法是這樣的。用一里的紗置於拉力機上，機器開動之後，待紗切斷，便可在拉力機的指示計上讀出拉力的大小。</p>
<p>一里紗是怎樣的沙呢？將紗在個外框一碼半長的搖紗機上搖得八十圈，這紗絞便叫做一里。一里紗的長度是一百二十碼。</p>
<p>普通沒有拉力機，可用彈簧秤代替。將里紗一端繫於釘上，一端鈎於彈簧秤上，然後用力拉動彈簧秤，同時注意秤上的指示計，待一部份切斷後，便可讀出紗的拉力來。普通紗的拉力大有高下，供給本廠織布用的便很大，出售的可差得多了。售紗拉力的磅數人槪如下：十支八十磅。十六支七十磅。二十支六十磅。三十二支五十磅。四十支四十磅。</p>
<p>條格勻凈影響布疋的製織。條格能勻，製織容易，織出的布疋，平滑無疵。條格能凈，織出的布疋也潔凈。這對於布疋的售價大有關係。怎樣才算條格均勻呢？紗條上粗細相差極小的時候可算均勻。至於凈呢？紗條上要少有葉屑破子。如何可以勻，如何可以凈，這要靠紡績的技術了。</p>
<p>條裕勻凈如何測騐呢？紗廠適用的方法是將要騐的紗用紗板機搖在黑板七。紗條緊密靠着，在黑色的底板上，很明顯地顯出紗條來。條格的勻凈與否，一望便可比較而知了。</p>
<h3>市塲知識顧問</h3>
<p>凌耀宗君來問：茲有三問題敬請解答　明實情：</p>
<p>（一）日金票在上海市價的一元折合法幣一元三角，而滙豐電滙法幣白元僅合日鈔廿五元許；何故相差如此之巨？否則直接携鈔赴日，定能獲利。</p>
<p>（二）滙劃貼現每千今父需貼費百餘元；設擬有款存人銀行，作長年定期儲蓄；可吾先購該行滙劃票，再將滙劃票照票價存人？銀行是否拒收？</p>
<p>（三）何謂外滙套利？</p>
<p>王　秦答：</p>
<p>（一）前者是日鈔價，後者是日滙價。照埋，外幣行市與外滙行市，本不應相差如是之鉅。但發生惡性通貨膨脹的日本，却就例外了。因爲日本鈔票，一離開日本本國，便像放逐一樣；不許再回去。這理出門不認賬的日鈔，當然就要慘烈地跌價，那是當然的結果。　於滙豐銀行所掛的日金滙似，那是根據日本官價計算的。因爲日金的官定滙價，依然維時着對美二十三元半左右的水準，因此與實行貶値政策的法幣互滙起來，日金便顯得昂貴了。何况滙豐銀行掛牌的滙價，根本還是一種黑牌價，所以滬對日的滙率便較日鈔價貴出許多了。簡單地說：以法幣一元三角買進的日鈔一元，那是日本人自已都不要的賤紙。因爲日本國內是拒絕牠進口的。至於以法幣百元買進的那廿五元左右的日本滙票，是可以滙到日本，在日本國內作爲存款，或用以付賬，或用以購買貨物的，與前述的日鈔，在用途上是完全不同的。</p>
<p>（二）銀行可以照辦，惟到期祇能領取滙劃，如須領取法幣，則須認繳領款日之滙劃貼現率</p>
<p>（三）外滙套利者，即出資買進低價之現貨，同時乘高價賣出期貨，經過若干時期，而交貨禮手，獲得盈餘之謂也。</p>
<p>張錫麟君來問：下列各同，請撥冗一覆，曷勝感荷：</p>
<p>（一）貴報商業新聞市價表各國貨幣一覽內有下列項：</p>
<p>英鎊　一一四·〇〇　港幣　三·五二</p>
<p>英票　五三·四〇　法郎　〇·二九</p>
<p>美金　一一八·五〇　等等</p>
<p>美票　一四·四五</p>
<p>未悉該項市價，是否爲法幣一百十四元合英金一徬？及法幣一百十八元五角合美金一元？英票美票等如何計算？其買賣所在，及手續，尤望詳爲說明。</p>
<p>（一）現在上海是否有英之一先令銀幣？及一鎊半鎊之金幣？美之五元十元金幣？一元半元之銀幣出售？在何處有買？</p>
<p>（三）關於現在外匯黑市塲（即暗盤）在何所在？買賣手續是否與交易所相同？（即經紀　手續）或直接向銀行購買？戰前是否有此組織？</p>
<p>（四）現在上海之現金買賣之所在地及其手續。</p>
<p>王相秦答：</p>
<p>（一）是的。以上所載，皆係每一外幣折合國幣之暗盤市價。君如無商業上之需要，即如無正當用途，請勿輕於嘗試。因此種市塲，現已被投機份子操縱。君如參與其間，非特係非法行爲，且有傾家蕩產危險。至少限度，你每進出一次，就要犧牲一次佣金。</p>
<p>（二）有的。但閣下如有過剩資金，還是以存人銀行爲有利。</p>
<p>（三）外匯市塲云者係指買賣國際匯票之一種抽象區域而言，此種市塲，原無具體市塲之組織，更無一定之集合塲所。至其「黑市塲」之名，係於戰時始有之，因其買賣匯票價格，非照官價計算，係照暗盤價格計算，故有斯名。按搆成上海外匯市塲之分子有外商銀行，華商銀行，進出行，外匯經紀人及投資與投機家等。平時買賣有現貨期貨之分，現貨當天交割，期貨月底交割，期貨較現貨貴。開市時間：爲每日上午九時至十二時，下午二時至四時，星期三星期六下午無市，星期日全日無市。如欲購買，可皆接向銀行錢莊定購，或由經紀人代買亦可，惟買進賣出均須繳付所規定之佣金。在投機劇烈，市價倏　倏落中，且多損失危險，故如無正當用途，尙以小嘗試爲宜。</p>
<p>（四）戰前上海金市塲在九江路「上海金業交易所」內，「八一三」後該所已奉令停業。現在所有者係一投機的暗盤市塲，地址在××路一一九號四樓××銀號內，其開市時間，與外滙市塲同，惟交易祇限現貨烚赤，又名「條子」。按烚赤成色十足，形狀有方條扁條二種，每條計金十市兩，平時買賣單位以一條爲起碼，當日交割，亦有做期貨者，惟極秘密。客戶買賣可委托投機之錢莊銀號代辦，買賣時祇須每條繳付佣金二元至五元即可。如無資力者亦可委托投機錢莊銀號代買及代做押款，惟委托時除繳付相當佣金外，尙須繳納保證金，及至賣出時尙須付還　購金款之利息。故吃虧甚巨。查證金的　五百元至一千元，利息的月息二分至四分。不過各家所規定之佣金，證金，及利息等，均不一律，大都視委託者之交情信用如何及銀根之鬆緊，而有高低之分。觀於此種經營方式，以及通來市便之暴漲暴落；即善於投機者亦難免發生損失；凡不善於投機者，自更小待言。尤其如　款爲買賣的辦法，經營此業者之目的在於委託人之保證金及利息。以保證金及利息繳納後即全盤蝕去者，比比皆是。不善此道，不熟稔內幕者，豈可輕於嘗試乎？</p>
<p>趙正行君來問：茲閱貴報（廿九年二月十九日第三張十一版）經濟專刋商業新聞欄戰：一海外各國互匯」「英對滬——四便士四三七五。」如港兌滬是否相同？照此，港交紙幣一千元滬得若干？至祈賜予函覆無任感盼！</p>
<p>王相秦答：</p>
<p>英匯與港匯全屬兩事；各不相同。按前者係以英鎊對法幣之每日匯價而言；後者是以港幣對法幣每日之匯價而言。查二月十九日英滬滙兌爲四便士四三七五合法幣一元，港滬滙兌則為二十六元七角五分合法幣百元。若照是日滙率計算，由港滙港幣千元至滬，則在滬可得法幣三千七百三十餘元。</p>

<p>該股票去年最高價爲七十六元五角、最低價爲二十八元、平均爲五十二元餘、已超過票面二三倍、今年四閱月來、忽漲至比去年最高價猶高出幾二百元、以此計算則該公司今年資產已增高四千七百八九十萬元、無論該公司各種財產、以各物市價之比値若何、斷不能於此短期內高漲如此鉅値、即其所發之利息、亦未見比其他各股特別加多、倘以市價爲比例、則所得利息亦極微末、此層固我投機家所注意、但倘買進股票、而不詳查其資產營業及消路三種基本條件、而人云亦云者、則絕對爲禍大和小、可無疑義、此爲投資投機者、皆應具有之普通常識、其他各種、亦莫不皆然、</p>
<p>目下股票投機之風、愈演愈熾、每一經紀人、其辦事處大者、不啻爲規模宏大之洋行、小者則賃屋一二間而已、各其無綫電發音機一具、由衆業公所隨時報告其行市及成交數、衆業公所內、除經紀人外、在開做時間內、絕到不容許任何人入內參覲、故各經紀人之辦事處、乃男女相混、好似睹塲、</p>
<p>衆業公所最近規定買賣交割規則、爲每週一至週五之五日內、買賣可以其同品同量之貨互相軋直、計算具差金、免除收解之勞、過此必需交割、故此五日之猶豫時期、不管爲投機份子闢一方便之門、換言之、爲五日短期之期貨、且與經紀人稍有認識者、更無需預繳保證余、</p>

<p>修築圍基</p>
<p>粵省三面濱海，各屬村鄉，多恃圍基，以障狂瀾而奠安宅。圍基之修築，其經費有領自官者，有儲於民者有之。東南北三江之水滙合之區，在古勞圍，地當廣肇兩府各縣衝要，圍外則巨浸汪洋，圍內則田廬比櫛，道光年間，曾經沖圯二次，賴附近各村紳耆合力修築，費資數萬，至今獲慶安瀾。近年水漲頻仍，圍基間有損壞，耆紳目擊情形，亟欲未雨綢繆，以期有備無患，集眾公議，擬將圍基低陷者築之使高，單薄者培之使厚，傾妃者修之使固，損缺者茸之使完，此誠備災之要務，防患之良圖也。詎料有兩孝廉，因會　時不請彼等列座，多方掣肘，眾為駭然，昔連州黃損少有大志，在匡廬讀書，與桑維翰宋齊邱相友善，每執手論天下事，二人恒以為不可。及偶同遊五老峯，憇於石上，有叟長嘯而至，三人與之語，叟諦視良久，謂維翰曰：子異日位當宰相，然而狡狡則不得其死。謂齊邱曰：「子亦至宰相，然而忍忍則不得其死。」獨異損曰：「此子有道氣，當善終，然才大位晦，不過一州從事耳。」損曰：「有才何患無位，下僚何足以阻黃損哉。」叟笑曰：「非爾所知也。」其後維翰相晋，齊邱相南唐，皆見殺，損仕南漢，官尙書左僕射，及退歸，損貲築高良之陂，灌田百餘頃，鄉里賴之。今人居家而不能澤及鄉族，又安望居官而澤及民生乎。</p>

<p>衣食住行</p>
<h3>勞工們的衣與食</h3>
<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>光　如流水般的飛逝，後大（五月一日）又是國際勞働節了，本市勞工界，因爲環境關係，不擬舉行儀式，但於是日休假一天，藉以表示與世界勞工携手，並示慶祝之意。勞工，以廣養而言，凡日出叩作日入而息，勞心勞力的人，都可稱爲勞工，不過就狹義而言，似乎專指一般勞工苦仗軍，他們終日以氣力和技能謀生的。社會上雖有「勞工神聖」的雅號，但以中國的一都分勞工觀察，實也凄慘得很！他們眾朝　　，也許有日以繼夜的，還是難謀一飽，這是社會制度的不良，實有改善的必要！筆者現在來的路談談勞工的衣食。</p>
<p>在工廠　服務的工友們，比較奔波街頭的苦工，自然較爲優越，這因為他們在電力或機械方面，挾有專門的技能。他們在工場　工作的時間，是穿着特製的工塲服，這件工塲服是以粗布製的，顏色大都以深藍色爲多，取甚耐穿避汚，但作煤灰知機油的氛圍中工作，仍不免油汚滿身，可是在工作完畢出塲，便換上整潔的服裝，翩翩如佳公子了。若論街頭的苦工，如碼頭的扛夫，抬力，和路工，黃包車夫等；他們抵有一襲破舊的，　　的短衣褲，並無更換華服的時侯，他們耐苦的精神，是值得佩服的。</p>
<p>勞工的食，工廠工友們也比較勝些，每天三餐，在晨　的時侯，隨意吃些點心或泡飯，便進廠上工，到午刻放午飯工，有的距離寓所相近，就回家吃飯，路遠的朋友，便向就近的飯館吃經濟飯，還有一班女工，附在工廠中吃包飯，其中經濟的女工，就在早晨進廠時，帶一些飯和菜去，以充午飯，待到放夜工，男女工友自然都回家去吃晚餐了。獨有街頭苦工及黃包車夫等，他們雖則照樣每天努力工作，吃飯時間却小一定，或早或　，若遇到衣袋　經濟不足的時候，便胡亂的買幾塊大餅，油條，或麵食等，都可用以果腹的。他們艱苦前工作，而得到的享受，如此菲薄，我們應該對他們表同情。深望關心社會的人們，能夠設法改善也們的生活，使他們衣食無　，庶不負紀念勞　節的　義了。</p>
<h3>西裝保護法</h3>
<p>— 小齊</p>
<p>近來穿西裝的人們，是一大比一天多了，但是每多不會收藏及整理，以至很快的變成蒼老和敝舊，失掉了美觀，現在介紹它的　護方法如下：</p>
<p>我們日常穿着的西服，總免不了要沾上許多灰塵，日積月累，便失去了原來的美觀。所以每次從外面歸來，必須將晚下的衣服，用衣刷刷去灰塵，無論上衣或褲子，刷法均須一律，先由下向上刷，使毛反逆，然後再由上而下，將毛刷順，使其恢復原來狀態。刷時須用力稍輕，以免損壞質料，因西裴多半是毛織物，即有時非毛織物時，須用此刷法，否則不但不能刷凈沾染的塵埃，且容易損壞。此外常置家中不穿的衣服，也要時常取出刷凈衣服上如發現汚點或油漬，須立即設法除去，如爲新沾酒演，可用浸水毛巾包着汚處揉擦，立刻可以除掉，如已經過相當時間，可用稻草灰煎汁擦上，再用水揩，仔細拂拭，即可消滅。</p>
<p>汚點如果係果汁類所沾染，可用普通石碱擦上，再用水輕洗即除。衣領袖口等處汗汚，可隨時用揮發油擦拭，即能消除，褲脚處最易着泥汚，濕時不必擦，等到乾後，用紗布察拭去。</p>
<p>西裝褲子因摺縫必須整齊，故有時常熨燙的必要，但燙燙的次數過多，不免損惕衣料，所以最好於每晚臨睡時，將西裝褲子摺　整齊，舖於一平坦的桌子上，用重物　着，如此便可使褲自的摺痕不至於走形了。</p>
<p>西服上衣，每夜用吊衣內架掛起即可，如嗶嘰，類，切不可在上面直接熨，須隔以濕毛巾，否則即燙成如鏡面而起光。又如汗衫等時常替換的衣服，洗　須將衣袋中汚物除盡，洗後晒好必須等到乾透才可收下，並要熨燙後方可穿着，如果隨便從事，即會變成不美觀的西服了。</p>
<h3>活動住宅</h3>
<p>— 倪新</p>
<p>世界上的人，再沒有比美國人更善於享福的了。美國的生活稈度最高，然而美國人的生活也最舒適。美國都市人民的生活最緊張，可是工作之餘，他們尋快活的方法也最多。看起來不易辦到的，他們也能想法子辦到。大地回春了，人們對都市生活都感到厭倦。他們所最渴念的不是吃得好，穿得好，而是隔離了煩嚣的都市，趕到恬靜的田野，在那裏解除了領帶，伸一個懶腰，呼吸一點新鮮的空氣，接受大自然的一切，陶醉在春的懷抱裏。這些事在別國的都市生活者，似乎認爲僅是甜蜜的夢想而已，可是這些夢想都　美國人做到了。他們的方法就是利用最近在美國流仃一時的活動住宅。</p>
<p>所謂活動住宅，就是用鋁或鋼造一所住宅，造得一半像房子，一半像車廂，底下裝着輪子，用機鈕和汽車相接，如此便可將這所住宅在意開走了</p>
<p>這種活動住宅是爲適應都市人的出野生活，而由專家設計製造的。所佔地位，極爲經濟，外面看上去似乎體積甚小一，但內部面積却相當寬大，和一公共汽車相頡頏；裏面大　有一個廚房，一個臥室和一偭休憇室。雖然很簡單，可是必需一的設備却應有盡有。</p>
<p>將活動住宅從都市駛到鄕村，在一個相當地點停下來，便可以很舒適的領略田野生活的樂趣。以前雖然也有都市人到鄉村裏來舉行野餐，露宿等等，但是以便利和舒適而言，那和今日的活動住宅相差得太遠了！</p>

<h3>食養小志　落花生</h3>
<p>— 張鐃人</p>
<p>落花生爲　類植物，俗稱呼爲長生果，　高尺餘，多蔓延地上，葉爲羽狀，　葉，花色　，形如小蝶，花後子房入地一二寸，結實成莢，中藏種子一粒至四粒，質脆味甘，炒之以爲消閒食品。康熙初年，佾應元赴扶桑　種，寄回我國，始有此品。產於興化者，味甘粒滿，曰黃土；產於臺灣者，味澀粒細，曰白土；蓋其土性不同；故其所產亦優劣逈異耳。相傳其尖能生痰，故食時須去之，予以爲其尖乃結晶之處，所以欲去之者，蓋以其不易消化，非患其生痰也。而李時珍本草綱目未收，可知古時無當醫藥之用，然能益脾潤肺，和胃化痰，實具滋養之力，惜醫家咸目爲閒食，且能生痰而不採取。予每見鄰家患咳嗽痰多者，輒取生花生數十粒，去殼膜，取凈肉搗爛冲湯服之，而痰嗽自安。昔童鹿葊家凡遇痰嗽，亦用此法，且謂其化痰之功，勝於爪蔞貝母。世俗以火炒食反能生痰，然予嘗試之，以炒熟花生八九粒食之，覺痰聚而易吐，因之消痰豁痰之作用，全在生熟之分別，但食之俱宜少耳。</p>
<p>食賽小志爲吾師栩園先生命作，此篇乃未經刪潤，而遽歸道山，噩耗傳來，心傷靡已；爰塡鷓鴣天一闋，附錄於後，正不知涕淚之盈箋也。</p>
<p>噩耗侵晨驀地聞，黯然無語欲銷魂，怕提往事還投筆，食養何堪讀舊文。思俊逸，句淸新，任拋心力作詩人，泉臺冉訂他生約，願結程門未了因。</p>

<h3>一星期經濟榮單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>列位主婦們，你們在油菜多的時候，可曾做過菜花頭麼？怎麼叫做菜花頭呢？就是將油菜炻熱後，放在陽光中曬乾，便可久藏不壞。入夏以後，隨時煮食，無論葷素，都是很可口的。葷的做法，可把它和猪肉片一同紅燜，肉油糝透在內，十分腴美，肉片帶有菜花杳，也別有風味。素的做法，可把　菌笱片和菜花頭一同紅燒，或是用它做湯，略加麻油，也是下飯的妙品。</p>

<h3>「小竊黨」請各教師家長讀完這篇報告</h3>
<p>— 慶賢</p>
<p>這是一個不幸的消息，筆者在昨天下午發見「小竊黨」偷案。現在將經過始末，略誌於後，並希各位家長教師們注意及之。</p>
<p>在前天的下午，得販否貨的報告，說有一羣小孩偷竊貴店毛巾等物，並欲售與販舊貨者，彼以來源不正，未予收買，而特來相告等語。本店同事接此警告後，特別戒備，尤其注意常在店口出入的小孩，因此便有昨日被捕的一慕。</p>
<p>先是大約有八九個小孩，在店外遊玩，最後有二人進店集行偷親「工作」，以致被捕。</p>
<p>「你偷我們的商品麼？」我開始這樣的審問他。</p>
<p>「先生！我不會偷！」</p>
<p>我拉牢他的一雙小小的手後，便在他袋裏抽出被偷的三條手帕，再問他：「那是什麼？你承認你偷竊麼？」</p>
<p>「先生！我下次不會！」他哀求着。</p>
<p>「可以，我可以原誼你。但昨前天二次偷毛巾的也是你？」</p>
<p>「不，不，不是我。」在這時候，另一個職員又捉着一個所謂「望風」者，他大約十一二歲，瘦得像猴子似的。我揮問他道：「你幾歲？你叫什麽名字？」但我連問三次，他　沒有答覆。那時我就用恐嚇的語氣說：「假如你不告訴我，我們便要打死你！」我揮着手對着他。</p>
<p>一個較大的還是一句話也不說。较小的似乎被嚇倒了，慢慢的說：「我今年十一歲，名字叫田××，師兄（指較大的）十四歲，姓王。都在赫德路××小學讀書。」</p>
<p>「你為什麼要偷竊呢？」</p>
<p>「一天晚上放學時，當我踱出校門，有一個着西装的拉牢我的衣袖，笑嘻嘻的說：「好弟弟！我給你五毛錢好麼？」</p>
<p>「你為什麼給我錢？我不要。」</p>
<p>一我不但給你錢，而且要請你看影戲，吃點心。」</p>
<p>一我不能接受的。」</p>
<p>「好弟弟！你是田××麼楚你的父親叫我來陪你看影戲吃點心去的。</p>
<p>「先生！眞的麼？謝謝你，我跟你去。」</p>
<p>「看好了影戲，在吃點心的時候，他向我要求一件事∣—叫我偷竊，我驚異地說：「母親不尤許我的，況且我不願意去偷人家的東西，偷東西的人是賊！」</p>
<p>「影戲好看麼？點心味道好麼？錢買來的糖甜麼？假使你不會偷，只要你看牢你的師兄王××有沒有人要捉他，那末，吃，看，錢都可天天的得着了。一穿西裝的對我說完了，便招呼對桌預先坐好的二位向我介紹。</p>
<p>「那位是吳隊長，你要聽他的指揮那位是王大哥（同學），是你的師兄，你望牢他有沒有人去捉他。」</p>
<p>「我入了他們的黨後，知道共有會員二十七人，分三小隊，每隊有隊長一人。放學時，二十七人集中預定的地方，聽穿西裝者分派往各處偷東西，由隊長指揮。晚上四點半各歸預定交貨地（每天不同）交貨。憑各人工作力量，而可分得五角至一角的償金。散會時穿西裝者定明日放學後的集中地及交貨地。假使沒有東西去交賬，便要受他的鞭責，假使己入其黨（看過影戲奢為巳入黨）而不去工作，或欲退出，則欲遭其毒打。</p>
<p>因此，我雖然後悔，但是終不能脫身。今慶王師兄是偷竊者，我是「望風」者，吳隊長早已回去報告穿西裝的了。」</p>
<p>我聽了他的話，不覺悚然血驚，這是怎樣重大的一個問題啊！孩子的心是純潔的，但意志力是薄弱的，那穿西裝者，把中國的小國民用威迫利誘的恐怖手段去引入盜匪之路，這罪惡見殺不可恕的。不過，在放學之後，敎師與家長能夠注意孩子們的行動，也決不會發生這可怕的事的。</p>
<p>各位家長們，教師們！快快的去嚴厲地監視你們的子弟吧！</p>
<p>編者按：這是百樂商塲某商店職員把親自審問「小竊黨」的結果寫來的一篇報告，那兩個孩子已送靜安寺捕房了。這種比拐匪更可惡的組織，希望各學校，各家長，能夠協助捕房，迅速破案。</p>
<h3>管閒事的正義人</h3>
<p>— 康</p>
<p>今晨八時許，膠州路新閘路口，一卡車駛過，將一踏自行車之青年撞倒於地，拋出竟達六七尺，下身受傷。該卡車司機非但不將傷者扶起，反飽之以老拳，而車上小工，亦務同毆擊，使此傷者傷上抓傷。期時，旁觀之路人雖皆忿忿不平，但終無一人挺身執言者，幸適有一英商公共汽車查票員（號碼　忘）上前仗羲執言，並喚至街捕，將一行送入捕房究辦。時作者適路過，經訊旁觀路人，方知此事，其他路人此時方議論粉紛，或曰：「此查票昌仗義執言，代抱不平，實足欽佩！」或曰：「何必結寃呢？多一事不如少一事，管什麼閒事，管來管去，總是多事！」更有人曰。「若我為司機，必先請此查票員吃頓生活。」吾聞之，不禁有感：查此卡車司機過失傷人，非但不加援助，反動手毆擊，殊矚不當，非處以重罰，不足以儆尤。此查票員，能抱不平，仗義執言，實足為吾人之模範，更由此可見公理之尚存也。故特誌之，並代傷者向此仗義之查票員深致謝忱。</p>
<p>「管閒事」並不是壞專，並且有時我們正需要「管閒裹」的正義人。</p>
<h3>義務應診</h3>
<p>— 基派</p>
<p>以前，本刊會經介紹過兩個專為貧病者免費治療的醫院，一所是兆豐花園對面白利南路三＋七號的美國難民醫院，另一所是望志路近呂班路的童生醫院，這，確是一般貧病者的福音。</p>
<p>今天，我還要介紹的就始一個「義務應診」的國醫。曹念修先生。</p>
<p>曹先生的診所是設在愛文義路派克路中和里十七號。他規定在每天上午八時至十時是義務應診的時間，在這時間內去應診，除不收一切的診費外，赤貧者還司得一點藥費的幫助。</p>
<p>這對於一般的貧病者確是一個很有力的救濟，我願全滬的醫師以著先生為榜樣，每天抽出兩小時的功夫，為貧病者盡一點人類應五助的義務。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第廿三回　舊侶新儔文章有價　名區勝地領管得人</p>
<p>這一餐飯，吃了九點多鐘。九點鐘以後，他們編輯部，正是上工的時候了，也未更再去了找擾他們，這幾位小姐們，也各自散歸。歡散的當兒，金澹雲便約定她們，明天是試第一輛家庭旅行車了，請各位姊妹，到我家裏，一同出發，吳君素說道：「我是不能去了，今天已經吿了一天假，明天是再不能告假的了。」金澹雲便問：「明天你什麼時候有課？」吳君素道：「明天倒要下午纔有課咧。」金澹雲道：「那就好了，我們在上午，就用這旅行車，送到你東吳在大學便了，送你到了學校後，我們再去游玩。第二次試車旅行時，我們挑一個星期六，或者星期日，我們再來約你同游。」吳君紗道：「那又何必呢？你們待會送找回學校，不是多耽擱時間嗎？而且你們預備往那裏去旅行，只恐路也不便。」金澹雲笑道：「因為路是更的，所以我纔如此說了。恰值這幾天秋高氣爽，風物晴和，那是一個已涼天氣未寒時」。江南各處，蟹肥稻熟，沿太潮各處的裏湖馬路造成以後，我們只有幾次斷斷續續的走地。據說有好幾處風景極佳，萬頃烟波，漁舟蕩漾。這一回蘇　雅太太，也想趁此一游，所以我們橫堅要過蘇州，可以乘便送你到學校呀！「吳君素道：「原來如此。」邵慧華道：「君素姊！你要不當這大學敎師何等自由。此刻我們大家去游玩，你卻是向隅了。我勸你明年還是辭去了大學敎師，到我們報館裏來當編輯吧。」到了明天作鐘時，大家齊集到金澹雲的家裏。金澹雲道這一次也算是蜜月旅行，可是公開的蜜月旅行。除了他們新夫婦之外，還有蘇理雅太太，還有許多金澹雲的小備一切，都是新的。中國雖然會經製造過不少家庭旅行車，但是每一次逐漸改良。這車子的改良，不能全靠車子的本身，因為與它的原料與環境，都關係。譬如造一輛車子，有木料，金屬物，油漆，橡皮輪等等，而中國的橡皮製造業，也日漸逹。此外便是道路，要是道路修得不好，車子也容易壞。所以若是講起年份來，那車子便是中國的一九五一式了。　（二六九）</p>

<p>上帝自己，已經給我們立下一個忠于小事的榜樣，例如說蜂房吧，蜂房的構造，原是最困雖而最精細的一個問題。一百五十年前，英國著名的數理學家，曾討論過這個問題，他們羣認這蜂房的構造最適合數學的原理。上帝如些用心創造這麼小小的一個蜂房，這足以證明他在小事上的忠心。我們又看看主耶蘇也是不輕視小事。例如他當日以五餅二魚食飽五十人之後都團當去問她，耶穌去想到病人的缺乏，隨吩咐人把東西給她吃。以上這幾件事，都是主耶穌忠于小事的確證，我們須知道做一件小池上好事，或作一件小小的壞事，都與我們的人生有極重大的影響，某五決意自己建築業一座極其客莊的禮拜堂，以榮耀上帝，當禮拜堂築成之時，他召請了詐多的人來行獻堂之禮，他走到禮拜堂的墻角下，看見　角石上刻的乃是一個窮　婦的名字。他於是吩咐人停止行獻堂禮，並吩咐人把那窮寡婦帶來問她說，「你做了什麼呢，你的名字刻在墻腳石上？」婦人說，她本要出資幫同建築禮拜堂，無奈自己太窮，拿鐵不出，她於是常常往田野劑草給拖車的馬吃，以償其願。王聽了這話，即道，讓她的名子刻在石上，她所做的比我所做的多！（待續）</p>

<h3>法國將領對於奎寗之意見</h3>
<p>— M.Hhin.182</p>
<p>在一九一六年世界大戰中。自七月至十二月，當時薩雷將軍致當軍政部長曰：我軍已在醫院中解散矣！」</p>
<p>自經此番瘧疾大流行後，法國政府遺源瘧疾研究專家薩尚德兄弟出發工作，以免法軍全遭瘧蚊　滅，結果規定用奎寗根治瘧疾之各種步　其有企圖規避治療者重責不貨，制定法則，嚴萬施行，使此項撲減瘧疾運轉得收家效。</p>
<p>條塞將軍向軍醫演說時，言及瘧疾之流及用奎寗治療之方法，請：「在從事撲減流行症之工作時，最難克服之大敵厥為「疏忽。」關於服用奎青之規定如同軍令，必須人人運照實行，不容唬曉爭培。」佛塞將軍固深知大敵之所在者，然當時對於奎寗之用法尙無精確之規定，近年以來，國際聯盟會瘧疾委員會經過長期之研究，規定全寗十五喱至二十喱，連服五至七天。瘧疾委員會一九三八年報告書第一百二十四頁上特別提出一點，卽奎寗一物安全無害，常人均能施用，無須醫師鹽督施用，而綜合性之樂品則非醫師鹽督施用不可。</p>
<p>法軍駐在馬其頓之軍隊所以米全被瘧疾戕害者，自當歸功於其統領薩雷將軍與佛塞將軍之速見卓識，彼等認為用奎寗為本軍治療瘧疾不特為責任所在，抑亦出於必要也。</p>

<p>Luoyang: Chinese troops in the areas south of Shanxi and north of Henan, with a far-reaching large encirclement, are pressing the stubbornly resisting Japanese troops in the area between Bo'ai and Jincheng, tightening their lines and attacking on all sides. The Japanese troops, in extreme panic, are staging breakouts. On the morning of the 27th, one group fled north but was intercepted by the Chinese forces at Jianxidayang Village, north of Jincheng. They were met with a head-on attack and threw away their weapons, fleeing into the mountains in disarray. Another group retreated to the Xihe Riverbed west of Jishen Village (both southwest of Lingchuan), where the Chinese forces are currently encircling and annihilating them. (Dispatch of the 28th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Chinese Army's Spring Offensive – A Quick Victory</h3>
<p>With the warming climate, the Sino-Japanese war, which had been in a stalemate, is gradually showing signs of activity. The continuous stream of victories from the northern and southern battlefields not only directly strikes at the clumsy and inadequate political offensive of the Japanese side but also provides unparalleled comfort to the struggling and determined people. The ever-increasing confidence in becoming stronger through fighting and the belief that the war of resistance will surely be won are all further realized in this full-scale offensive by the Chinese army.</p>
<p>If military developments can be divided into smaller segments, then this full-scale offensive by the Chinese army should be considered to have begun with the Suiyuan-Western campaign in late March. At that time, it was the eve of the Nanjing farce, and people may not have paid due attention to the recovery of the two strongholds of Wuyuan and Linhe in the barren Gobi Desert. However, that was precisely the most important scene of the war since the beginning of 1940. It demonstrated the extent of the Japanese army's declining strength, which was unable to secure even strongholds of great strategic value. Moreover, after the Japanese army's initial defeat, their repeated reinforcements and counter-offensives only served to expose their exhausted state, and they finally abandoned their attempt to make a comeback. At the same time, the Chinese army on the Guangxi-Guangdong border repelled the Japanese army's invasion near Lingshan, completing the second annihilation campaign in southern Guangxi. The Japanese army was also unable to launch a strategic offensive, and its greatest tactic was merely jump-style harassment operations to protect its rear strongholds connected to the sea. On the northern Jiangxi front, the counter-offensive was launched around Nanchang on the 4th of this month, and important strongholds such as Fengxin, Jing'an, Anyi, Xiangtang, Xishan, and Wanshou Palace were recovered one after another, directly threatening the suburbs of Nanchang. From the 15th, a heroic and fierce battle unfolded again between the Zhongtiao and Taihang Mountains in southern Shanxi. The Japanese forces, with a strength of 100,000, advanced along nine routes, attacking south from Yuncheng, Anyi, Xiaxian, Yicheng, Changzi, Changzhi, Huguan, and other places. The battle stretched across a 4-500 *li* area from Maojin in the west to Lingchuan in the east. The Japanese side's intention was clearly to revive its unfulfilled wish to cleanse the mountainous areas south of Shanxi, but its strategic deployment and troop mobilization were not necessarily stronger than in previous attempts. After two weeks of fighting, the Japanese army, suffering heavy casualties, was trapped in encirclement and annihilation. In addition to the recovery of Maojin Ferry, Lingchuan, Yangcheng, and Gaoping, the Chinese army's counter-sweeping operations clearly had full confidence. What was particularly encouraging was that the Chinese army suddenly attacked Kaifeng on the 23rd, engaging in street fighting for a day and still fiercely fighting in the suburbs. Among the above-mentioned battles, the Suiyuan-Western and Guangxi-Southern campaigns repelled the Japanese army's advance, the Jiangxi-Northern and Henan-Eastern campaigns counter-attacked the Japanese side's strongholds, and the Shanxi-Southern campaign was a contest between sweeping and counter-sweeping. All these battles, although different in strategic nature, all achieved significant results. From another perspective, that is, whether the Japanese side is attacking, defending, or carrying out rear "sweeping" operations, it has been consistently defeated. This is an important test and also implies the final outcome of the Sino-Japanese war.</p>
<p>Since the Meiji Restoration, Japan has blindly followed Germany in military matters, striving to emulate Germany in both soldier training and strategic application. However, the results have not only failed to resemble the German army but have even been vastly different. For example, the blitzkrieg tactics used by Germany against Poland, Denmark, and Norway, although difficult to escape moral condemnation, must be acknowledged for their high degree of achievement in military terms. This Nazi product is by no means something that the Japanese army's troop quality and military equipment can learn. The followers of Itagaki fantasize day and night about performing an eastern Tannenberg miracle, but they do not realize that in the several concrete and subtle Tannenberg battles in southern Shandong and northern Hubei, it was not the Chinese army that was encircled and annihilated, but the Japanese army itself. This experience of failing to imitate a tiger should be a profound lesson for the Japanese plutocrats. Looking back on the course of the Sino-Japanese war over the past three years, initially, the Japanese army's strategy and tactics were successful, but only its fundamental political strategy failed, such as in the fierce battles of North China and Shanghai. Then, it was able to maintain some success tactically but failed strategically, such as in the Shanxi-Western, Hunan-Northern, and Guangdong-Northern campaigns last year and this spring. However, in recent battles, it has been defeated in every battle, with no strategic or tactical success whatsoever. Its military application has run counter to its desire to conquer China. However, this has not prompted the Japanese plutocrats to repent but has instead turned to the delusion of using politics to alleviate the military's distress. In fact, that political offensive still relies on military strength for support. However, the dilapidated Japanese army is not able to save the Japanese plutocrats any face, fight a few victories to embellish the situation, but instead welcomes the arriving Abe "special envoy" with successive defeats, just as the Japanese army in northern Hunan welcomed Nishio and Itagaki with a disastrous defeat last autumn. Of course, the current Chinese army is only launching a full-scale offensive and has not yet reached the time for a general counter-offensive. The Japanese army may still have other new tricks waiting to be used. However, all the possible strategies of the Japanese plutocrats have been tried and ultimately failed, with only their adventure in southern Guangxi being the only exception during the second phase of the war of resistance, but it also cannot save the Japanese army's overall decline in any way. The Chinese army's current offensive is already difficult for the Japanese side to resist, so the future is predictable—naturally, the Chinese side should also strive to eliminate the drawbacks of arrogance or underestimation of the enemy due to victory—even if the favorable conditions of China in political, economic, and diplomatic aspects are all put aside, looking at it solely from a military point of view, the future can also be optimistic. This is not wishful thinking, but a conclusion written in blood and flesh by Chinese heroes in the northern and southern battlefields.</p>
<h3>Japanese Invasion of Qingyang in Southern Anhui Frustrated; Chinese Army Achieves Great Victory; Japanese Troops Scattered in Southern Anhui and Southwestern Anhui; Mountain Warfare Unfolds Northwest of Jingxian; Zhangbinying Has Been Recovered</h3>
<p>Tunxi: Japanese troops from Wuhu and Wanzhi in southern Anhui launched a multi-pronged invasion of Qingyang and engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army.

<h3>National Government Consolidates Economic Defense Line</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to today's political news, the National Government has decided to establish an organization in Chongqing similar to the blockade departments and economic warfare departments of Britain and France in order to intensify the blockade of Japanese goods and consolidate its economic defense line. This new organization will be jointly managed by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Military Law Department of the Military Affairs Commission. This organization may be named the Economic Blockade Commission. The government's intensified blockade is due to the discovery that Japanese goods of considerable value are still being smuggled into Free China. Even with numerous tax collection agencies in Suiyuan and Guangxi, they have not been able to stop the smuggling. These goods are transported by rail, road, waterway, and other routes. According to official estimates, the total value of Japanese goods smuggled into Free China is 100 million yuan annually. These Japanese goods are adorned with Chinese trademarks and labeled with the words "Made in China" to deceive Chinese customs officials. The smuggled Japanese goods are mainly textiles, cosmetics, matches, pencils, and cigarettes. Officials also stated that with the establishment of this new organization, the tax collection agencies in various regions will all be under its jurisdiction. As it is also under the jurisdiction of the Military Law Department, smugglers will be subject to military trials and severely punished. (United Press dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Economic Society Holds Annual Meeting</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The 15th annual meeting of the Chinese Economic Society was held at Chongqing University on the morning of the 28th.

<p>Chongqing: The Chinese Economic Society recently held its annual meeting at Chongqing University. Over two hundred well-known Chinese economists attended.

(United Press dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Strictly Limits the Export of Legal Tender</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Officials here claim that, in order to maintain the currency system, the Ministry of Finance is increasingly tightening the regulations on implementing restrictions on the export of legal tender. The revised restrictions still allow 500 yuan as the maximum amount to be taken out of the country. From Yunnan to Burma, a maximum of only 200 yuan can be carried, from Yunnan to the border of French Indochina, only 20 yuan can be carried, and from the southwest to the guerrilla areas, only 200 yuan can be carried. If the above limits are exceeded, it will be confiscated. (United Press dispatch of the 27th)</p>
<h3>The US Neutrality Act Does Not Need to Be Amended Before the Election; Britain and France Have Sufficient Financial Resources to Purchase Various War Supplies from the United States Within Two Years</h3>
<p>Washington: Observers in political circles here have recently stated that the current Neutrality Act is unlikely to be amended during the current session of Congress. It is generally expected that discussions will be postponed until the end of this year's election when Congress reconvenes in January of next year. Regarding this matter, Democratic Senator Adams recently advocated that the provisions in the Neutrality Act prohibiting the granting of loans to belligerent countries should be amended as soon as possible. However, some members of Congress believe that this amendment is still premature because the Neutrality Act prohibits the United States from granting loans to warring countries, but in fact, both Britain and France can still purchase military supplies in the United States because these countries have sufficient financial resources to purchase various war supplies for at least the next two years. Therefore, there is no need to rush to amend the Neutrality Act to facilitate these countries. (Havas dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>Washington: Senator Pittman recently stated that he estimates that the Allied countries have sufficient financial resources to support two years of war without incurring foreign debt. He does not believe that the war will continue for two years. (Reuter's dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<h3>American Countries Concerned about the European War; Argentine Foreign Minister's Speech</h3>
<p>The capital of Argentina: Today marks the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Pan-American Union. The Argentine Foreign Minister Cantilo recently delivered a speech at the Institute of Historical Research. The ambassadors of various countries to Argentina were present. He briefly stated that although American countries are maintaining neutrality towards the modern European war, this does not mean that they are turning a blind eye and a deaf ear.

<h3>Internal Conflict Among Japan's Ruling Class: A Commentary from the Soviet Red Star Newspaper</h3>
<p>Moscow: The Soviet Red Star newspaper today published an article detailing the internal conflicts within Japan's ruling class. The article stated, "The conflicts within Japan have intensified, and the government has repeatedly encountered crises. This fact proves that the Japanese ruling class cannot reach a consensus on either domestic or foreign policy. Japanese soldiers, military-industrial tycoons, adventurers, and speculators are all profiting from the war, and they naturally do not want to give up China or reduce the interests they have seized in China. On the other hand, 'liberals' oppose the continued warfare by the military clique in China. They believe that the Japanese army has no possibility of conquering all of China. At the same time, they pessimistically assess Japan's domestic economic resources and the value of Japanese imperialism. They all believe that without foreign capital, Japan will never be able to 'develop' the resources it has seized in China. The formation of the Yonai Cabinet proves that the conflict among the Japanese ruling class has become increasingly fierce, and the dissatisfaction and anti-war sentiment of the working masses have also intensified. The Japanese military and exploiters can no longer ignore this severe situation." (TASS dispatch from the 27th)</p>
<h3>Chiang Kai-shek and Wife Send Letter to Methodist Episcopal Church Joint Conference Expressing Thoughts on War: "The Root of War in China and Europe Lies in Human Selfishness and Greed"</h3>
<p>Allentown: General Chiang Kai-shek and Madame Chiang yesterday sent a letter to the first joint conference of the American Methodist Episcopal Church, lamenting the European and Sino-Japanese wars, saying they are rooted in "human selfishness and greed." The letter stated, "The fundamental cause of the bloodshed and disasters plaguing our country and Europe is human selfishness and greed. The goals of human life have not been influenced by Christian teachings." (United Press dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<h3>Restriction Issues of Blockade Policy: Agreement Established by Britain, France, and the United States: Certain German Medicines Allowed to Be Exported to the U.S.</h3>
<p>Washington: British and French economic experts, including one named Gordon Lister, have been in discussions here with U.S. authorities regarding the blockade policy and mail inspection issues for quite some time. It has now been learned that after both sides made considerable concessions to each other, they have reached a mutually satisfactory agreement. In essence, the British and French sides have agreed that certain German-produced medicines that cannot be purchased elsewhere should be considered exceptions and allowed to be imported into the United States as usual, without being restricted by the British and French blockade policy. (Havas dispatch from the 27th)</p>
<p>Washington: The mission of the British and French commercial commissioners in the United States concluded yesterday with a statement issued by British Commissioner Ashton-Gwatkin. Ashton-Gwatkin also told the press that Britain and France could engage in wartime trade with the United States without significant friction. U.S. Secretary of State Hull has stated twice that Britain and France have given special consideration to the blockade of German goods being shipped to the U.S., and that the blockade of goods that only Germany can supply, such as eyeglasses and precious objects, will be carefully considered. However, Secretary of Agriculture Wallace said in a speech in St. Paul yesterday that Britain and France aim to purchase the goods they need from countries that can meet their demands, and the United States is one of the countries they are focusing on. However, the British and French commissioners in the United States have not achieved great success. At the same time, Britain and France also hope that the U.S. Congress will relax restrictions on belligerent countries in terms of goods and credit. Regarding the bill authorizing President Roosevelt to suspend payments of Norwegian and Danish deposits in the United States to prevent them from falling into German hands, a fierce debate erupted after Senator Connally from the Republican Party proposed an amendment to the bill in order to eliminate the president's power to suspend settlement payments.

<h3>Soviet Union's Immigration Plan in Occupied Polish Territory</h3>
<p>Paris: The Polish government's press office here issued a statement yesterday, declaring that the Soviet Union is rapidly transporting Polish people from the territories it occupies in Poland to Siberia, and moving people from the Far East, from the Mongolian area, into Poland. (United Press dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<h3>Danish Ships Sailing on the High Seas: Britain Has the Right to Intercept According to International Law</h3>
<p>London: British Minister of Shipping Hudson gave a speech in Southampton today, clarifying Britain's attitude towards Danish shipping. He said that in practice, ships flying the Danish flag can be requisitioned by the Danish government. Since we have driven German merchant ships from the sea, how can we sit idly by and watch ships flying the Danish flag, but controlled by Germany, replace German ships without taking action? According to international law, we have the right to arrest Danish captains on the high seas and treat them as legitimate prizes. Therefore, we are willing to rent Danish ships at a reasonable price, provided that they change to the British and French flags and that the rental fees do not flow into Germany.

<h3>British and German Troops in Stalemate in Stenkjer District of Central Norway: German Troops Advance Across Mountain Paths from Røros: Norwegian Troops Forced to Abandon Steinkjer</h3>
<p>Stockholm: Military experts here say that the war in the Stenkjer district of central Norway has turned into a positional war. However, one thing is quite noteworthy: the German motorized units in the Røros area have reached the north bank of the Glomma River, advancing towards Steinkjer, south of Trondheim. The area is originally mountainous, with high mountains and ridges, the highest reaching 1,000 meters, and covered in thick snow. However, the German motorized units are overcoming difficulties and attempting to cross the mountain paths in an attempt to establish contact with the German troops in the Trondheim area. According to the latest news, these motorized units have indeed crossed the mountain paths and are approaching Steinkjer. As for the war situation north of Røros, Norwegian troops have been forced to abandon the city, but are still trying to prevent the German troops from advancing rapidly towards the Swedish border. (Havas dispatch from the 27th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: A Havas correspondent with the Norwegian front lines recently reported that the fighting in Norway is now taking place on three fronts: (1) The German troops in Narvik in the north are still surrounded and about to run out of food. (2) Major battles are taking place in the two areas of Namsos and Trondheim Fjord in the central region, with the Allied forces in the Trondheim Fjord area approaching Steinkjer. (3) Lillehammer in the south is still in the hands of the Allied forces. German propaganda has falsely claimed that it has been captured. In addition, 23 German troop transport ships secretly entered the Oslofjord via secret routes. (Havas dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: According to various newspapers, the British expeditionary force exerted strong pressure on the German troops in central Norway, preventing them from advancing towards Dombås. It is now known that the German troops in that area have retreated from Otta and are concentrating north of the Osterdalen River. Their fresh troops are said to have arrived in Røros. (Havas dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>London: The War Office recently issued a communiqué stating: (1) There have been no major changes in the positions of enemy and our forces north of Steinkjer in central Norway. Our patrol units have been quite active and have captured several enemy soldiers. (2) In the Gudbrandsdal region, the enemy launched a fierce attack on Allied forces in Kvam, but was repelled with heavy losses. However, the pressure on the Allied forces from the enemy has not decreased as a result. German air forces continue to bomb Allied supply lines and bases in the rear. (3) Nothing of note has occurred in the Narvik area. (Havas dispatch from the 27th)</p>
<p>London: The newspapers here today continue to comment on the war in Norway, acknowledging that this is the beginning of a long-term war. The enemy has been planning to invade Northern Europe for some time. After this sudden dispatch of troops, they immediately occupied various airfields according to their planned and deployed strong air forces. They have been able to bomb the Allied forces of Britain, France, and Norway at will because of this. However, the British and French Allied forces have now hastily built many temporary airfields to allow their air forces to take off and land to meet the enemy. It is hoped that they can immediately send a strong land and air force to help in the battle. (Havas dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: Colonel Barrera, a famous Spanish military commentator, recently spoke to a Reuters reporter about the situation in the Norwegian war, saying that even if the German army could break through the Østerdalen valley, pass through Storlien and reach Trondheim, the transportation facilities through Dombås would have to be occupied by the Allied powers for this connection to be maintained. Therefore, the landing of troops in Åndalsnes and the occupation of the railway to Dombås are the main military features. It is expected that the German army will do everything possible to cut off this communication and occupy Dombås. (Reuters dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<h3>German Planes Bomb British Ships: Communiqué States Multiple Hits: British Air Force Attacks German Airfields</h3>
<p>Berlin: A German military headquarters communiqué states that on the night of the 26th, the British air force bombed Narvik. The German air force continued to bomb enemy troops landing in Harstad and Åndalsnes. A British cruiser was hit by heavy bombs near Narvik. A British anti-aircraft cruiser near Åndalsnes was hit by several bombs and heavily damaged. Two British troop transport ships sank in Molde Bay (totaling 12,000 tons). Four other troop transport ships (totaling 23,000 tons) were severely damaged. One British aircraft was shot down in the North Sea, and two others were destroyed on the ground. One German aircraft is missing. No significant events occurred on the Western Front. (Haitong dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: Several British aircraft attacked the German-occupied Fornebu airfield in Norway yesterday, bombing it heavily and destroying several German aircraft. Several more crashed into trees while trying to escape and were also severely damaged. In addition, the German authorities ordered civil servants in Oslo, Norway, to go to Fredrikstad to build an airfield. At the same time, the airfield in the suburbs of the city will also be expanded. (Havas dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<h3>German War Report</h3>
<p>Berlin: A communiqué from the German military headquarters this afternoon stated that in the past 24 hours, German forces have continued to achieve victories in Norway. Although Norwegian troops attempted to resist, the German army, with the assistance of the air force, was invincible. German aircraft were extremely active, not only bombing enemy troops and supply routes in the front, but also attacking enemy troops in the rear to demoralize them. Many enemies were captured yesterday, including one British colonel. After the German army occupied Voss near Bergen, the isolated Norwegian forces in that area fled into the mountains. In the Stavanger area, the number of prisoners has increased greatly, totaling 241 officers (including British pilots) and 2,921 soldiers. In this area, 22 artillery pieces, 267 machine guns, and countless other military supplies were seized. (Haitong dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<h3>Germany Appoints Administrative Chief for Occupied Areas of Norway: Directly Responsible to Hitler</h3>
<p>Berlin: Yesterday morning, the German government gazette disclosed an order from Führer Hitler appointing Josef Terboven as the administrative chief of the German-occupied areas of Norway. The declarations and military actions taken by the Norwegian government have placed the two countries in a state of war. The German government has decided to establish an administrative chief in the Norwegian territories it has occupied to protect the lives and security of the public. The administrative chief has supreme jurisdiction over all administrative matters and has the power to organize a Norwegian governing committee or appoint Norwegian civil servants. The German commander in Norway will be the military commander (similar to a pacification commissioner). The administrative chief will directly receive instructions from the German Führer and is responsible to the Führer. (Haitong dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<h3>British War Office Denies Senior Officer Captured</h3>
<p>London: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop mentioned yesterday that a British brigade commander had been captured. The British War Office now refutes this claim, saying that no British brigade commander or staff has been captured in the Norwegian campaign. (Reuters dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The British side denies the news that a member of the staff of a British brigade was captured by the German army. Journalists here expect the German propaganda department to invite foreign journalists to meet with the captured British officer. (Haitong dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<h3>Allied Forces Vow to Fight Hard for the Liberation of the Norwegian People: Broadcast Speech by British Air Minister Hoare: Denounces Ribbentrop's Remarks as Despicable</h3>
<p>London: British Air Minister Hoare recently gave a broadcast speech to respond to the remarks of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, saying, "All I can say is that the claim that Britain had conspired to invade a neutral country is an utterly despicable lie, and this lie, coming from the mouth of those who destroyed Czechoslovakia and Poland, is particularly disgusting. Ribbentrop is an adventurous and insidious figure who has done great harm in public affairs. No upright gentleman takes his words seriously, and no impartial neutral believes them. We will ignore his lies and turn to the crimes committed by Hitler and Ribbentrop in Norway. They have made Norway a battlefield, forcing us to fight on a new front. We accept their challenge. We must use all the material resources we can develop and all the people we can gather to confront the enemy in this area. Let us not have any illusions. The war has now entered a tense and important stage. The enemy will do everything possible to fight without restraint and will not give us any rest. Hitler, disregarding everything, has dragged the Norwegian people, who have lived in peace for generations, into the war. Hitler has no regard for the loyal and courageous people of Norway, and we do not want to imitate him. We do not want to drown helpless sailors, nor do we want to bomb undefended cities, nor do we want to defeat the Germans by terrorizing German women and children. But we do not want to allow Hitler to monopolize the advantages in energy, skill, and determination. We must show that our qualities far exceed those shown by Mr. Hitler. We pay no attention to any threats made by Mr. Hitler. We now have a responsibility that must be fulfilled. The Allied forces must gradually recapture the Norwegian ports and air bases in German hands, and must place the people of Norway, who have been invaded, in a position to have weapons and power that will drive the enemy beyond the valleys and harbors. But our current work, to speak in detail, is by no means easy. This cannot be accomplished overnight without sacrifice. We must now fight hard, with aggressive actions and persistent plans, to regain the advantages gained by Germany through its despicable and shameful attacks."</p>
<p>Hoare continued to speak to the Norwegian people, saying, "The largest British navy in the world, the strongest French army in the world, and the most technologically advanced and courageous British and French air forces in the world are now the guarantors of your liberation. We rejoice in the heroic leadership given by your King Haakon VII, and at the side of King Haakon is Admiral Evans, who upholds the maritime traditions that both the Norwegian and British peoples cherish. Britain rules the seas, and Norway relies on the sea for its livelihood. The freedom of Norway and the future of Britain are tied to the sea, and this will be made even more secure in the future. The Norwegian coastal batteries have assisted the British navy, and the British navy has also given the enemy an undeniable blow. The Battle of Narvik was not only characterized by courage, but also achieved complete success. The German fleet had no time to hide and was completely destroyed. Even if the Norwegian war situation has not yet been determined in other respects, this battle is indeed a result that has been achieved. The German navy is no longer a major weapon, and the enemy has lost so many warships that Britain is now freer to use its ships to meet strategic and defense needs. The British land, sea, and air forces have also achieved excellent results in the past half-month and have demonstrated their amazing ability to bomb enemy bases on the Scandinavian Peninsula. The air bases in Stavanger, Kristiansand, Aalborg, Oslo, Trondheim, and Vestlandet have all been bombed and severely damaged. This is the achievement made by the British air force in fierce resistance, and the British air force is now prepared to undertake even greater tasks. The British government is determined not to slacken in its determination to maintain its superiority at sea and in the sky, and the British government and people are determined to achieve this goal. The British power that is flying in the Arctic Ocean today will eventually bring us back to peace with the honor of free people and the victory of noble ideals." (Reuters dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<h3>Reactions in Various Countries to German Foreign Minister's Speech</h3>
<p>Paris: According to telegrams received here from various sources, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's speech has been met with derision by people in Hungary, the Netherlands, and Belgium, with the exception of Italy, which predictably praised it. People in Hungarian political circles said that the country only pays attention to its own interests. Ribbentrop's speech did not involve Southeastern Europe, so it does not need to be given much importance. In addition, people in both Belgium and the Netherlands said that Ribbentrop's intention was to prove to the people of those countries that the dispatch of troops to Northern Europe was justified. However, whether his white paper, which accused Britain and France of preparing to invade Norway, is true is still doubtful. (Havas dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>Concealing Aggression is Counterproductive</p>
<p>London: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's remarks and the recent publication of the German white paper have not caused surprise in official circles here. Germany always finds many important documents unfavorable to any country it expands its so-called sphere of protection to. These shocking facts are only a laughingstock. (Reuters dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>London: Today's leading Sunday newspapers have all published articles refuting German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's statements in his radio address in Berlin yesterday about the Allied plan to invade Norway. The Observer's diplomatic correspondent stated that it is no longer necessary to review past events to refute Mr. Ribbentrop's remarks, because people outside of Germany are familiar with them. One noteworthy question is why Mr. Ribbentrop invited the diplomatic corps to listen to his speech. Presumably, Mr. Ribbentrop's intention was to use this to strengthen the confidence of the people in his country. The Sunday Times stated that neutral countries are unlikely to readily believe Mr. Ribbentrop's claim that Britain had long prepared to invade Norway, so as to have a pretext for attacking Norway, because facts speak louder than words. Mr. Ribbentrop is following Germany's most despicable traditional methods, attempting to blame Norway, just as he did to Belgium during the First World War. In fact, both of these innocent countries strictly adhered to neutrality, and Germany used their neutrality to invade them. Afterwards, it added trumped-up charges to cover up its own actions. The most foolish of Mr. Ribbentrop's remarks was that Allied politicians conspired to seize Norway. For example, he cited British Foreign Secretary Halifax's warning to neutral countries not to request British assistance too late. Mr. Halifax did say that, but he did not threaten any British side. What Mr. Halifax predicted and mentioned was the threat of German action. Does this matter not sufficiently explain the accuracy of his prediction today? The rest of Mr. Ribbentrop's citations can all be explained in this way. (Reuters dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>Believed to be Aimed at Sweden</p>
<p>Paris: Political figures here have recently commented on the speech made by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, saying that this speech is obviously aimed at Sweden. It harshly attacked Norway and praised Sweden, which is quite ulterior in motive. This is no different from the period of Czechoslovakia's crisis in September 1938, when Germany attacked Czechoslovakia on the one hand and allied with Poland on the other. At this time, Germany has adopted the same strategy for the Scandinavian Peninsula, for Germany knows that Sweden has taken various precautionary measures, and it will inevitably encounter great difficulties if it launches a rash attack. Therefore, it wants to appease Sweden and make it negligent in its defense, and even demobilize part of its army, so that it will be easier to attack Sweden in the future. In addition, it is also noteworthy that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's speech avoids mentioning Denmark, which was completely invaded. (Havas dispatch from the 27th)</p>
<p>Italy Actually Defends Germany</p>
<p>Rome: Political circles here yesterday believed that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's statement was Germany's first serious legal offensive, hoping to avoid the stigma of being labeled with "war guilt" as it was after the previous European war. (United Press dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>Rome: The German government's white paper and news of the battle of Trondheim, Norway, have been transmitted here by various newspapers. In their commentary on the Scandinavian Peninsula war, they all took an extremely pessimistic view of the positions of Britain and France and wanted to make the general public believe that Britain and France had aggressive intentions towards neutral countries, thereby showing that the alliance between Germany and Italy had become more concrete. (Havas dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>Germany Repeats 20-Year-Old Tricks</p>
<p>Norway: Chicago German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's speech yesterday was refuted by Norwegian Minister to the US Morgenstierne, who said that Germany's invasion of Norway this time was exactly the same as the invasion of Belgium by German troops in 1914. Since the outbreak of the European war, our country has always strictly adhered to neutrality. Previously, when our country's neutral status was repeatedly violated, we protested simultaneously to Britain, France, and Germany. The cases of the German auxiliary ship "Altmark" and the American cargo ship "City of Flint" are clear evidence of this. Mr. Ribbentrop's claim that Norway had any conspiracy with a certain country can be refuted without attack. (Havas dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>U.S. Anti-Aggression Stance Unchanged</p>
<p>United States: Washington, Regarding German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's "dramatic speech," political figures here have commented that the U.S. holds a condemnatory view of any act of aggression, and a speech will not change the situation. President Roosevelt explained the U.S.'s position in the current European war in a speech on the 13th of this month. As for Ribbentrop's claim that the British Admiralty had already prepared a plan to invade Norway, this is not worth a smile and does not need to be refuted. (Havas dispatch from the 27th)</p>
<h3>Another Display of Disregard for Reason</h3>
<p>New York: The New York report stated that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's remarks on Norway yesterday were an insult to the reason of the whole world. The New York Times stated that the world will know how to choose between the English and Norwegian side on the one hand and Germany, which has repeatedly broken its promises, on the other. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch also stated that Ribbentrop had made a display of disregard for all reason. (Reuters dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<h3>Not Just the Self-Defense of a Murderer</h3>
<p>New York. Ribbentrop, the German Foreign Minister's speech yesterday, has now been commented upon by this morning's newspapers. The New York Times stated, "This purely dramatized statement, if one seeks its explanation, can be found in the solemn speech given by Führer Hitler hours before declaring war on Norway. In essence, Germany attempted to destroy Norway's resistance, but this barbaric act has already failed. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop therefore had no choice but to deliver yesterday's speech to shirk responsibility. That is all. In short, the word 'sincerity' has now been fundamentally shaken. People should know how to choose between the promises made by England and France, and the promises made by Germany." The New York Herald Tribune, under the title "The Defense of a Murderer," briefly stated, "Hitler wants us to acknowledge this defense, to regard the heinous crime committed by one country against another as justifiable. Is this even possible?" (Havas News Agency, 28th)</p>
<h3>The Intentions of German Military Activity are Unfathomable. Sweden Remains Vigilant, and Doubts are Not Alleviated by Germany's Declaration.</h3>
<p>Stockholm. Sweden has implemented various precautionary measures to prevent attacks, including curbing the activities of foreign spies. Foreigners are only allowed to travel by public transport, and there are many places foreigners are not permitted to enter. A national defense force has been established, and one of its duties is to arrest those who parachute from the sky. Air raid precautions are evident throughout the country. (Reuters News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>Stockholm. German newspapers have recently often criticized Sweden, claiming that, judging from Swedish newspaper opinions, Sweden has not adhered to the strict neutrality that Germany expects. However, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop suddenly made a statement yesterday saying that Germany is satisfied with Sweden's neutral position and neutral behavior. Swedish people found this very strange. If Germany is satisfied with Sweden's neutrality, then what is the purpose of Germany's military preparations in Memel and other East Prussian ports on the Baltic Sea, and the frequent appearance of German aircraft in Swedish airspace? Therefore, Swedish people cannot dispel their doubts based on the German Foreign Minister's words alone. Some believe that Germany's statement regarding Sweden is directed at the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union has stated that while it is willing to remain an observer regarding the events in Norway and the occupation of Denmark, if Sweden is involved, the Soviet Union will have no choice but to intervene.

<h3>British Aircraft Have Never Bombed Undefended Cities. German Propaganda Has Had an Effect.</h3>
<p>London. Sources here claim that German radio stations are now spreading lies about British aircraft bombing non-military targets. The German tactics have long been known. The reason for fabricating these rumors is nothing more than to prepare to carry out bombing actions and blame them on Britain. In fact, British aircraft have never bombed undefended cities or non-military targets. (Reuters News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam. According to reports here, the German Propaganda Bureau notified newspapers at the end of this week to intensify their campaign denouncing British bombing of undefended cities in Norway and Germany, in order to create public opinion so that Germany can take retaliatory action against Britain at any time.

<h3>British Foreign Secretary Meets with Italian Ambassador. Treasury Representative Returns to London.</h3>
<p>London. The "Sunday Times" recently reported that Foreign Secretary Halifax met with the Italian Ambassador to Britain, Bastianini, for half an hour yesterday, but the content is unknown. In addition, Mr. Playfair, a representative of the British Treasury, went to Rome several weeks ago, after the resolution of the Anglo-Italian coal dispute, for official business and returned to London yesterday.

<h3>The Italian Ambassador to Germany is Rumored to be Replaced.</h3>
<p>Rome. News last night indicated that the Italian Ambassador to Germany, Attolico, will be recalled home, and the current Ambassador to the Holy See in Rome, Alfieri, will be transferred to be the Ambassador to Germany. The reasons for the replacement are not yet fully known, but some believe that Attolico's return home may be beneficial to Italy. Mr. Attolico has considerable experience in European affairs. He once served as the Ambassador to Moscow, and was transferred to Berlin after 1935. (United Press, 28th)</p>

<h3>The 9th Supreme Military Conference Held Between Britain and France. Britain, France, Poland, and Norway Share the Same Views. Decision Made to Establish Air Force Base within Norwegian Territory.</h3>
<p>Paris. It was officially announced that the Supreme Defense Council of Britain and France held its ninth joint meeting at 2:30 PM today at the Prime Minister's residence at 10 Downing Street in London. The French side was represented by Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Reynaud, Minister of National Defense Daladier, Minister of the Navy Campinchi, Minister of Aviation Laurent-Eynac, Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Forces General Gamelin, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Vice Admiral Darlan, Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force General Vuillemin, and French Ambassador to Britain Corbin. The British side was represented by Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Halifax, First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill, Secretary of State for War Stanley, Secretary of State for Air Sir Kingsley Wood, Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Sir Alexander Cadogan, Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Newall, First Sea Lord Admiral Pound, and Chief of the Imperial General Staff General Ironside. Representatives from Poland and Norway also participated. Various issues arising from the current situation were discussed, proving that the views of the allied countries were completely consistent. Whatever events may occur in the future, they are fully prepared. (Havas News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>London. The Supreme Defense Council of Britain and France held its ninth joint meeting here yesterday. According to well-informed sources, the meeting discussed the war situation in Norway, paying particular attention to the setbacks suffered by the Allied forces in the areas south of Dombås and around Åndalsnes in Norway. The Allied forces landing in Norway acted very swiftly. The current need is for fighter squadrons to counter the attacks of German bomber squadrons. Therefore, various methods have been decided upon to establish air force bases within Norwegian territory. In addition, the meeting also discussed how to accelerate the supply of military supplies and how to coordinate the actions of the British and French Allied forces. (Havas News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>Paris. Responsible sources here stated that the goal of the ninth joint meeting of the Supreme Defense Council of Britain and France, held in London yesterday, was to make all necessary military decisions regarding the Norwegian situation, and to study the countermeasures that Britain, France, Norway, and Poland would always take in response to future events. Observers here generally believe that this joint meeting is a response to the speech given by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop yesterday, as the previous joint meeting, held in Paris on the 23rd of this month, unanimously decided that if Romania and Greece were to be invaded, Britain and France should immediately intervene, and that if British and French interests were threatened elsewhere, they should also rise to defend them. At a time when Germany is trying to politically and militarily isolate Sweden, the aforementioned decision by Britain and France is of great significance. Germany's current attitude towards Sweden is exactly the same as its attitude towards Poland during the Czechoslovakian crisis in September 1938. This is because the Swedish people are steadfast in their position and are determined not to be exploited by Germany, and Britain and France should also pay close attention to this situation.

<p>Section 3. This section consists of the orders from the head of the British Admiralty's Annex Bureau to the British Consul in Narvik, as well as the letter from the British Naval Attaché in Sweden to the British Consul in Narvik on February 14, 1940. The translations are as follows: (1) "Letter from the Swedish Attaché to the Consul" Dear Consul Cableton, I am introducing my confidential secretary, Maxton, to pay you a visit, carrying a large group of questions, by order of the Admiralty, for prompt reply. Please have Smith secretly carry the reply to Sweden to obtain a valid Swedish passport for four days, as the journey takes two days. Please also urge caution. All news will be reported in person by Maxton. Signed, John Bohman. (2) "Order from the Head of the Intelligence Department of the Admiralty to the Narvik Consul, January 31, 1940." The following questions are to be reported back as soon as possible, but in conducting the investigation, do not arouse local suspicion. Signed, Coke, Head of Intelligence Department.</p>
<p>The most important of the questions mentioned in the above two official documents are the following five: (1) Can the latest plans for Narvik port be obtained locally? (2) What is the defense of Narvik like? (a) Is the statement that there are five cannons in Afjord Bay reliable, and where are they located? (b) What is the caliber and range of the cannons? (c) Is it true that Narvik's defense consists of four anti-aircraft guns on mobile platforms? (d) Is it reliable that Narvik will be protected by twenty coastal ships? (3) Please provide detailed reports on coastal reconnaissance, landings, etc. (4) Is it easy to make the railway between Narvik and Riksgränsen go on strike? (5) Are there any ships in Kirkenes laying in wait to lay mines?</p>
<p>Section 4. The content is an excerpt from the letter from the French Naval Attaché in Oslo to the Commander of the Fifth Fleet of the French Navy, which contains information on the passage of troops through Norway, and discusses questions 1 to 40 in the letter dated January 29, 1940. The letter states briefly that telegrams No. 1058 of January 26, 1940 and No. 1187 of January 31 have been received. Regarding question 5, the Norwegian route, although Bergen port has the advantage of rapid landing, the Norwegian officers proposed the issue of the route, taking the Finnish military transport as an example, due to the great length of the railway and the difficulty of transportation. Norwegian officers generally believe that only Trondheim Bay and Narvik port are most suitable for this military action. Regarding the shipping conditions along Trondheim Bay, two points should be noted: (1) the conditions of the port of Trondheim itself; (2) the conditions of the ports along Trondheim Bay. Levanger is fifty miles from Trondheim and is located along the railway line directly to Stockholm. There is an excellent deep-water dock, which can be said to be an ideal place for secret landings. Wood pulp, the raw material for papermaking, is often loaded and unloaded in this port.</p>
<p>Section 5. These are documents copied from the Oslo Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The most important are translated as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Anglo-Finnish Cooperation and Norway's Position (Report from the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Prime Minister, February 17, 1940) "Confidential"</p>

Britain plans to land simultaneously in the ports of Bergen, Trondheim, and Narvik, and it is known that British First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill is determined to implement this plan as soon as possible. Signed, Torstrup.</p>
<p>(2) The Soviet-Finnish War and Sweden's Position (Report from the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Prime Minister, February 17, 1940) "Confidential"</p>
<p>Dear Prime Minister, according to a report from our legation in Sweden, an official from the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated today that there are no new developments in Sweden's position on the Soviet-Finnish war.

<p>Dear Prime Minister, according to a secret report from our legation in Britain, British First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill gave a speech on the neutrality of Northern Europe on February 2, hosting representatives of the diplomatic corps in London and journalists. He was displeased with the criticism of the long speeches by the Northern European countries. He believes that the best way to prevent Denmark, Sweden, and Norway from being dragged into the war is to make these three countries hate the Soviet Union and Finland equally. Churchill stated that Britain and France can only provide indirect aid to Finland, but if Norwegian territorial waters are threatened, the British fleet will immediately set out. Then the duration of the war will be extended accordingly. Signed, Mattingsen, Norwegian intelligence officer attending the meeting. (Haitong News Agency, 28th)</p>

<h3>Fujian Province Improves Wartime Transportation, with "Sustained Transportation" as the Main Principle</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence – Since the blockade of seaports and the destruction of highways in Fujian Province, the entry and exit of ships have mostly adopted guerrilla tactics, with no fixed berthing locations. Cargo transportation has been switched to manual labor. The provincial transportation company, in order to adapt to the needs, has specially established a manual labor transportation office in Fuzhou to oversee manual transportation matters. It has also jointly organized two transportation companies, Minnan and Mindong, with merchants. The Mindong Transportation Company operates three routes: Fuzhou to Wanyao in Ningde County, Fuzhou to Danyang in Lianjiang County, and Ningde to Gukou in Gutian County. The Minnan Transportation Company operates three routes: Fuzhou to Hanjiang in Putian County, Hanjiang to Quanzhou, and Xianyou to Yongtai. After cargo is unloaded from ships, it is carried by workers to its destination. The stipulated freight charges are distributed as follows: 84% to the carriers, 3% to the foremen, and the remaining 13% to cover management fees and all other expenses. The above applies to the coastal areas. In the inland areas, the provincial transportation company has established a separate shipping department, deciding to loan money to boat owners to build 1,500 sailboats to operate on the four routes of Yanping, Shaxian, and Yong'an; Yanping, Jian'ou, and Pucheng; Yanping, Shunchang, Shaowu, and Guangze; Yanping, Jiangle, Taining, and Jianning, in order to enhance water transportation tools on the upper reaches of the Min River. Recently, the transportation company also convened a meeting of the directors of the manual labor and shipping departments, as well as the heads of various land and water transportation sections, to determine the future direction of business, with the principle of maintaining "sustained transportation," conserving automobile consumption, and developing manual labor, handcarts, sailboats, and other businesses to compensate for the inadequacy of automobile transportation, strengthening land and water intermodal transportation, supplying military and civilian public transportation, and striving for rapid, convenient, and safe transportation within the scope possible, in order to fulfill the mission of wartime transportation.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Construction Department Prepares to Trial-Produce Camphor, Requisitioning Camphor Trees in Lishui</h3>
<p>Lishui Correspondence – The Construction Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, in order to enrich the resources for the war of resistance, has decided to conduct a trial production of camphor. It has specially requisitioned camphor trees in the areas of Shuinan and Tianjingling in this county. The price-giving method and standards have been submitted to the provincial government for approval, referring to the established practices of Fujian Province and the materials obtained from the survey of camphor tree production in various counties. It is proposed that high-quality camphor trees (pure white flesh) be priced at 70 yuan per meter in diameter, medium-quality (yellowish) at 60 yuan, and low-quality (reddish) at 50 yuan. Hollow and rotten ones will be reduced in price. According to these regulations, camphor trees in Tianjingling and Shuinan will be priced separately, and the county government will receive and distribute the funds.</p>
<h3>Ancient Temples in Jiangyin Devastated by the Japanese Army; Old Trees Felled for Fuel</h3>
<p>Jiangyin Correspondence – Xingguo Temple, located on Nanjie in the west gate of the city, was built in the Han Dynasty and is a famous ancient temple. Originally, there were more than 5,000 rooms, but they were destroyed in the war. In the temple, there was a seven-story pagoda, which was said to have been built by Lady Wu, the mother of Sun Quan, during the Chiwu period of the Three Kingdoms. The pagoda was also destroyed by fire. In 1924, during the Zhili-Fengtian War, the top of the pagoda was hit by a cannon from Huangshan Mountain, destroying a corner and turning it into a pen nib shape. For thousands of years, it has remained a relic for future generations to admire. There were only a few rooms of flat houses for the Buddha statue and monks' quarters. An old monk, Zhihong, maintained the incense fire. The old foundation was very wide, measuring dozens of acres. It was surrounded by short walls, and nearby residents planted soybeans and wheat, forming a plant enclosure. Inside, the trees were lush, with many old trees hundreds of years old. Since the fall of Jiangyin, the remaining houses in the temple have been preserved by the old monk. The pagoda is filled with bird nests. Every evening, as the sun sets, the birds return, and the sounds of birds are noisy, creating a grand spectacle. The Japanese soldiers often shoot at the birds for fun, and some even risk climbing on the dilapidated ancient pagoda to catch birds, and some have fallen to the ground and died. Recently, due to the high price of firewood and the lack of fuel, the trees in the garden have been almost completely felled. The soybeans, wheat, and firewood planted have been repeatedly damaged. The ancient temple has been devastated.</p>
<h3>Song Dynasty Stone Carvings Discovered in Taiping Lane, Suzhou; Bridge Railings from the Fifth Year of Qingli</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence – Suzhou is a place where cultural relics from the southeast gather, and the remains of former sages are well preserved. Since its fall, the losses have been enormous. Although those who care have tried their best to collect the remnants after the disaster, unfortunately, those with historical value have all flowed to the three islands. Recently, in front of Guangsheng Nunnery in Xiaotaiping Lane, west of Dalang Bridge on Lindun Road in the city, two stone railings erected by Cao Wennai, a resident of Fengchi Township, Changzhou County, and his wife Xia Sansanniang in the fifth year of Qingli of the Northern Song Dynasty, were suddenly discovered. The characters are exquisite and highly valuable for research on local history and evolution. A gentleman from Wuxian County has taken steps to preserve them. The fifth year of Qingli is now 895 years ago. The font of this stone inscription closely resembles that of Huang Tingjian, and the wording is very similar to the epitaphs of the Six Dynasties. It is truly a treasure of Suzhou's documents.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army Establishes a Fake Military Officer Training Institute in Shantou, Intending to Use Fake Military Officers to Control Fake Troops</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence – The pseudo-peacekeeping forces in the Chaoshan area are composed of smugglers, bandits, and pirates, with absolutely no military discipline to speak of. On weekdays, they gather in opium dens and gambling houses or extort and rob peddlers and merchants. When they encounter battles, three or five of them escape with guns, or the entire team surrenders. Since last year, more than six or seven thousand have escaped or surrendered. Therefore, the Japanese military authorities have completely lost confidence in the pseudo-troops. In February, they dispersed them to Chao'an, Chenghai, Nan'ao, and Xiamen for individual training, rotating them for training in a cycle, but it was still ineffective. In mid-March, the Japanese side transferred more than a thousand young pseudo-troops from the Northeast. They are physically strong and of better quality, all of them being good rural youths who were oppressed and transported to Chaoshan. Since arriving in Shantou, they have disobeyed orders. Every time a battle is decided, they always fire into the sky first, sending a signal, indicating that Chinese people do not fight Chinese people. The Japanese side felt that there was a lack of lower-level cadres in the pseudo-troops, making it difficult to control them. Therefore, they instigated the pseudo "Guangdong East Pacification Commissioner's Office" to establish a pseudo-army training institute, recruiting 50 students for the officer class and 200 for the soldier class in Shantou. The qualifications for the officer class require a degree of graduation from a secondary school or above, and the age must be between 20 and 35 to be eligible. The soldier class requires a degree of graduation from a primary school. The admission conditions require a guarantee from a Japanese military police captain or a pseudo-county magistrate or district chief to be eligible. Applicants must fill out a application form, identity certificate, resume, and photo to the pseudo-Commissioner's Office. The registration period is from April 1st to 18th, and the examination will be held at 9:00 AM on the 20th. After three months of graduation, they will be assigned to the pseudo-troops as lower-level cadres. However, it is said that there are very few applicants.</p>
<h3>Andrology: The Seriousness and Treatment of Lower Back Pain, Forgetfulness, and Insomnia</h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University</p>
<p>Regarding the occurrence of lower back pain, it is mostly caused by overwork. This is because the various tissues of the whole body are gradually damaged due to overwork, until they reach the point of being unusable – hence the outbreak of this condition.</p>
<p>In addition, it is caused by indulgence in sensual pleasures, with middle-aged patients being the most numerous. This is because excessive indulgence consumes sperm and blood, weakens the function of metabolism, forming the image of premature aging. The brain, kidneys, and spinal cord suffer from various pathological conditions. Lower back pain is just one symptom of weakness. All parts of the body are almost completely deficient, such as nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, brain weakness, insomnia, forgetfulness, and other symptoms, which are almost completely encompassed. This is truly serious!</p>
<p>People who are weak in energy and indulge in sensual pleasures mostly cannot escape the above symptoms. Their spirits are depressed, and their mental strength is particularly sluggish. They cannot pay attention to anything they encounter, resulting in seeing and forgetting, and their consciousness is confused. They feel pain in their spirits, and if they do not seek treatment quickly, it is difficult to guarantee that they will not shorten their lifespan.</p>
<p>In summary, the above-mentioned diseases will never occur in those who are not neurasthenic. To study the main root cause, one must first prevent masturbation in youth, because after masturbation, the prostate gland is destroyed, and nocturnal emission is inevitable, causing the body's sperm to dry up, directly affecting the health of the whole body. Especially harmful is mental masturbation, because mental masturbation relies only on unnatural fantasies, concentrating everything on one point, so it is very easy to weaken attention and reasoning ability. Therefore, young people who have the above bad habits must quit them quickly.</p>
<p>If one has the above symptoms in youth, happiness is completely lost. The method of treatment must be fundamentally considered. The fundamental method of treatment is to first restore the prostate gland to its original state, and then the function of metabolism will be vigorous, the blood will be sufficient, and the brain will be active. Memory will naturally be enhanced. I am a specialist in venereal diseases and know that the best of the prostate gland hormone preparations is "Buti Kang." This is because "Buti Kang" contains not only the prostate gland hormone of strong animals but also phosphorus to nourish the brain, iron to nourish the blood, and calcium to nourish the bones. It is divided into two types for men and women. The female type functions to regulate menstruation and seeds, treating anemia, premature aging, flat breasts, and loss of health, which is most effective.</p>
<h3>Gonorrhea Spring and Autumn: Destroying the Nests of Gonococci</h3>
<p>— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, Medical Doctor of the United States</p>
<p>Yue Wumu of the Song Dynasty had a very heroic saying, which was "Strike directly at Huanglong." Huanglong was the base of the Jin Dynasty. Eliminating it was the fundamental solution. Unfortunately, the effort failed, causing eternal regret. This shows that to succeed, a fundamental solution must be found. In terms of gonorrhea, gonorrhea patients often do not pay attention to it because the disease is temporarily hidden. All actions are no different from when they were not sick. As a result, it occurs and heals repeatedly, and the disease becomes increasingly worse, until it is beyond control. Therefore, those who are good at treating gonorrhea must be good at treating its root, and the root of gonorrhea must be eradicated. Any recurring disease must have its root cause not removed, and this is especially true for gonorrhea that recurs again and again. Therefore, I believe that it is not difficult to make gonorrhea temporarily hidden on the surface. What is difficult is how to strike directly at the nest of germs. Fortunately, science now has a high rate of development, and a safe solution has been found for such difficult problems. Originally, Dr. Peter, a German master of gonorrhea, with more than 30 years of experience, invented the "Clinone" (sold by Zhongying Pharmacy), a mixed preparation using protein and yellow pigment. Over the years, this agent has been proven effective by experiments by major famous doctors around the world. Its efficacy exceeds all ordinary chemical therapies, because this agent uses the principle of non-specific therapy and has been continuously improved and succeeded. Its efficacy can produce anti-gonococcal phagocytosis within a few hours after taking it. Whether it is early-stage gonorrhea or chronic gonorrhea, it can be quickly cured. This is because although gonococci have a strong reproduction ability and escape to many places, they cannot resist the efficacy of "Clinone," which can directly attack the nest of gonococci, like a dragnet, and it is difficult to escape. Therefore, gonorrhea cured by "Clinone" never recurs, and there is no case of failure. As for external medicines, men can use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally to wash the urethra themselves according to the diagram and instructions. Women can use "Carder Snowland Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories, inserting one tablet every night before going to bed and washing it away in the morning, and the effect will be even more complete and rapid.</p>
<h3>Cured Cases of Nocturnal Emission and Kidney Deficiency</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zheng Ting, Medical Doctor of Germany</p>
<p>The patient, Min Yunshan, is from Xiaoshan, Zhejiang, 24 years old, and lives in Dong Tangjia Lane, Shanghai. He came to my clinic for treatment last autumn. The condition he suffered from was as follows: He married at the age of 18, and his body was very weak. Moreover, he had masturbated before marriage. Although he was able to quit after marriage, his muscles were thin, his spirits were sluggish, nocturnal emissions still occurred, and he ejaculated prematurely during sex. Sometimes his erection was not very strong, and he had a tendency to lose semen upon seeing women. His kidney deficiency had reached its extreme. (Symptoms at the time of diagnosis) – Pulse 109 beats, auscultation varied, headache, tinnitus, severe symptoms of nocturnal emission, weight 93 pounds. Therefore, he has not had children after seven years of marriage. Moreover, if Mr. Min overworks during the day, seminal fluid will slip out instantly, his eyes are tired and dull, and his hair is sparse. He suffers from severe neurasthenia. (Treatment method) – He was given 15 minutes of electrotherapy every day, personally taught methods of health preservation, and prescribed the prostate gland hormone preparation "Buti Kang" for men to cultivate and replenish the losses, increase the prosperity of his kidneys, eliminate his neurasthenia, and restore his development. At the same time, he took three tablets of "Nair's Nocturnal Emission Tablets" before going to bed to consolidate the essence gate and stop his nocturnal emissions. After taking it for three months, all of Mr. Min's symptoms disappeared, his body was strong, his trunk gradually became firm, and his weight suddenly increased by seven pounds, which is sufficient to prove the efficacy of "Buti Kang" and its special success.</p>
<h3>The Seriousness of Cough</h3>
<p>— Sheng Zaiqiang, Needler</p>
<p>Cough is the easiest disease to be ignored, the reason is that cough patients do not have any dangerous phenomenon for a while, so it has been delayed, and the cough has become more and more severe, and eventually it is irreparable.</p>
<p>From the real pathological point of view, coughing is the lung's way of excluding foreign invaders, which is a kind of resistance to insult. If anesthetics are used, they will reduce the resistance. According to my more than 20 years of experience and reference to the experimental reports of doctors from various countries, the lung disease special medicine "Bofei Nair" invented by German Dr. Thome has the most remarkable effect. No matter how stubborn and difficult to cure or coughing that will become tuberculosis, after taking "Bofei Nair", it can achieve the effect of relieving cough and resolving phlegm within three hours, and nourishing the lungs and preventing tuberculosis. Its effect is far above cod liver oil, which has been proven by doctors from various countries.</p>
<h3>New Language of Gonorrhea: The Causes and Consequences of Urethral Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Once infected with gonorrhea, the initial gonococci mostly parasitize in the anterior urethra. At this time, if the gonococci are swept away with the method of lightning speed, the gonococci that have not gained a foothold will have no way to struggle and will be wiped out in one fell swoop. However, if you do not try your best to eliminate this germ at this time, then all pathological changes will arise from this. Generally speaking, gonococci in the anterior urethra are commonly seen in the prodromal phase of gonorrhea. When it enters the acute phase from the prodromal phase, the gonococci are no longer confined to the anterior urethra, but also enter the posterior urethra. All changes become more numerous, and treatment is more difficult than in the prodromal phase. The reason why gonorrhea caused by gonococci in the anterior urethra is easy to eliminate is that the anterior urethra has no complex structure physiologically. Therefore, treatment is very easy. If the gonococci have invaded the posterior urethra, although treatment is more difficult, if the gonococci have not invaded the urinary system or the internal reproductive system, or the blood circulation system, radical cure is still not very difficult. However, if it has become gonococcal cystitis, prostatitis, orchitis, arthritis, etc., it is equivalent to stating that the patient's gonorrhea has invaded these systems. Its treatment is not only more difficult than anterior urethritis, but also more difficult than posterior urethritis. All of these are the causes and consequences of untreated gonococcal urethritis. And the only therapy is to take the special chemical therapy drug for gonorrhea "Clinone" (available in Zhongying Pharmacies) to have the hope of eradicating it. Because if the gonococci are dispersed from the anterior urethra to the three major systems, the scope of the gonococci is vast, and it is absolutely impossible to use a single local surgery to complete the task of expelling gonorrhea. I also use German static electricity therapy to make the bactericidal power of "New Clinone" fully exerted. Consultation time: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, 20 numbers will be given out every day for consultation. Each number will only cost 5 jiao and will be given a copy of "Complete Book on Venereal Diseases" worth one yuan.</p>

<h3>French Ambassador to China, Mr. Cosme, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon; French Soldiers Formed a Guard of Honor and Played Music to Welcome Him; Traffic Was Cut off on the Bund Due to Precautions</h3>
<p>French Ambassador to China, Mr. Cosme, previously went to the authorities in Beijing and Nanjing to handle routine official business. He left Shanghai on November 10th of last year for Hong Kong, transferred to Hanoi, and took the Zhenyue Railway to Indochina. He stayed in the new capital for nearly half a year. Now, due to private matters in Shanghai that need to be handled, he arrived here at 11:30 AM yesterday. The ambassador's hair has turned gray. Yesterday, he was wearing a light gray suit and looked energetic, frequently nodding to those who welcomed him. After inspecting the guard of honor, he went to the embassy to rest with Consul General Baux de Bégard and his two daughters. The detailed situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>A Guard of Honor Was Formed and Arranged to Greet Him</p>
<p>The French Embassy in Shanghai had already received the ambassador's telegram reporting his arrival date. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, a guard of honor was formed at the French Mail Steamship Company pier at No. 9 on the Bund in the French Concession to welcome him. Led by Colonel Aisudite, the French Army Commander in Shanghai, the guard of honor was composed of French sailors, French army soldiers, and Vietnamese army soldiers. They stood in a square formation around the pier. There was also a band. However, due to the one-and-a-half-hour difference from the original arrival time, the people at the scene were all waiting anxiously.</p>
<p>Precautions on the Bund, Traffic Was Cut off</p>
<p>Along Avenue Edward VII on the Bund, up to the entrance of Taikoo Company, traffic was temporarily cut off from 9:00 AM yesterday morning. No Chinese or Western people or vehicles were allowed to pass. Those who needed to go from the Bund in the French Concession to the 16th Pier were rerouted to Rue de la Cathédrale and then to Avenue de la Mission. Along the Bund, additional Chinese and Vietnamese detectives were added to maintain order. In addition to trams, all eastbound vehicles were also prohibited from passing. Senior Western detectives from the French Concession Police Department were also dispatched yesterday to direct traffic on Avenue Edward VII and Avenue de la Mission.</p>
<p>The Ambassador Landed Amidst the Music</p>
<p>The ambassador arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 10:35 AM on the French Mail Steamship Company's "Felix Roussel". The ship docked at the Gongo Xiang Pier in Hongkou. The ambassador himself was welcomed to the company's pier on the Bund in the French Concession by a small launch dispatched by the shipping company. At 11:00 AM, the ambassador arrived at the pier amidst the welcoming music. He first shook hands with the French Consul General, Mr. Baux de Bégard, and Colonel Aisudite, the French Army Commander in Shanghai, as a greeting. The ambassador, holding a felt hat in his left hand, inspected the guard of honor at the scene from north to south, and then shook hands with friends as a greeting, which lasted about five minutes. He then went to rest at the embassy at No. 2 Avenue de la Mission with the French Consul General's wife and his two daughters.</p>
<p>Coming to Shanghai This Time to Handle Embassy Affairs</p>
<p>Those who went to welcome him yesterday included French Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Baux de Bégard, Mr. Auchi, French Army Commander in Shanghai, Colonel Aisudite, and the ambassador's two daughters, who also held red flowers in their hands to welcome him. A reporter from the Dazhong News Agency visited Ambassador Cosme at the French Embassy at No. 2 Avenue de la Mission yesterday afternoon. Mr. Cosme, due to the fatigue of the journey, appointed Secretary Pelletier to meet with the reporter. According to Mr. Pelletier, "The ambassador has no mission this time. Because he has been separated from his wife and children for a long time, he has come to reunite and handle embassy affairs. Mr. Cosme previously suffered from dental disease and was unwell. He went to Hanoi for recuperation and stayed for ten days. He is now completely healthy. The ambassador arrived in Shanghai this morning with a very simple entourage. Only Secretary Charles Garnier accompanied him to Shanghai."</p>

<h3>Attack on Da Mei Newspaper Reported, Suspect Apprehended, No Weapons Found</h3>
<p>The mainland press reports that after the machine room of the American Da Mei Evening News was attacked with hand grenades on the 27th, the French Concession Police Department has arrested a suspect, from whom clues may be discovered to solve the terrorist activities of recent months. The arrest of a suspect has been confirmed by the Police Department. It is said that after the crime occurred, police personnel searched for the perpetrators in the area and apprehended the suspect on Avenue du Consulat. According to informed sources, although no weapons were found on the suspect, he may have been stationed nearby by the perpetrators as a lookout. It is expected that the suspect will be interrogated thoroughly at the police station, and he will not be prosecuted in the Second Special District Court until the investigation is complete. In addition, during the attack, Phan Van Phuc, a Vietnamese constable, age 30, who had been working in the French Police Department for about two years, was killed. Last summer, he and other police officers engaged in a fierce gun battle with the attackers of the newspaper office at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Chang Geng Li. He unfortunately died in the line of duty this time. The funeral was held at the Xujiahui Public Cemetery at 3:00 PM on the 28th.</p>
<h3>Sir Victor Sassoon Returns to Shanghai from America, Arrives at 9 AM This Morning</h3>
<p>Sir Victor Sassoon, a famous British financier in Shanghai, traveled to the United States to inspect business and stayed for several months. He has now returned to Shanghai on the American mail ship President Coolidge, which will arrive at 7:00 AM this morning (the 29th). He will transfer to the motor launch Mary Moller and is expected to disembark at the Jianghai Customs Wharf on the Bund at 9:00 AM. It is reported that while in the United States, Sir Victor Sassoon gave an interview to a reporter from the New York Herald Tribune on February 24, explaining the plight of Japan's domestic situation and criticizing Japan's actions in China. The Japanese side was extremely indignant about this and issued a statement through the so-called "Shanghai Jewish Community Association" under its control in an attempt to cover up the situation.</p>
<h3>Pork Shortage, Meat Market Closed</h3>
<p>All butcher shops in the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession were closed yesterday morning due to lack of supply. It is understood that Shanghai needs 3,000 pigs per day. Recently, the pig-producing areas around Nantong have been monopolized by the Japanese, with heavy and endless taxes, making transportation to Shanghai very difficult. As a result, most pig vendors have ceased operations due to lack of profit. The source of supply to Shanghai is becoming increasingly scarce. The day before yesterday, there were only 800 to 900 pigs in all the pig markets. With numerous butcher shops in both settlements, the average distribution was less than one pig per shop, which was far from sufficient. The shops in the area of the extra-territorial road, such as Caojiadu, were still supplied as usual because they were within a special area. The remaining twenty-odd pigs were distributed to the butcher shops in the two settlements, which was not enough to meet the demand, so they had to close their doors and suspend business. In short, the current cost of goods has soared. Even if there are goods to sell, the losses would be too great. It is better to suspend business and only lose operating expenses. It is reported that yesterday's market price was a maximum of ten taels per yuan, or even seven or eight taels, and even wholesale among the same trades was only about one market catty per yuan. This suspension of business is entirely due to the shortage of goods. Whether the supply can resume today depends on the source.</p>
<h3>May Day Labor Holiday, Labor Community Celebrates the Holiday, Work Hard on Wartime Production in the Spirit of Collaboration, Hope Employers Improve Treatment Due to High Prices</h3>
<p>On May Day, the labor community in Shanghai will, as usual, take a day off to celebrate. However, due to the special circumstances, activities such as gatherings and assemblies will be suspended. Holiday wages will still be paid by the employers. Chinese workers, as the country is in a time of war, are determined to work hard on wartime production in the spirit of labor-management collaboration. However, due to high prices and the rising cost of living, they deeply hope that employers, within the possible range of their operations, can automatically improve the treatment of workers, such as increasing rice subsidies, so that they can work with peace of mind and overcome difficulties. The settlement authorities, because there are many anniversaries in May, have increased police force and taken planned precautions. The police authorities of the two settlements have also established close contact, so there is no concern about security.</p>

<h3>Dispersal of Refugees Has Begun, First Batch of 2,000, Refugee Camps Can Be Closed in a Month</h3>
<p>At its peak, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association accommodated over 400,000 refugees and established over 100 refugee camps. Due to continuous dispersal, there are now 15 directly affiliated refugee camps, accommodating over 9,000 refugees. The association's monthly administrative expenses are 9,000 yuan. Last month, due to financial constraints, it actively carried out dispersal. It is now learned that the first batch of dispersal work was completed yesterday morning. A total of over 2,000 refugees voluntarily registered to request dispersal. The second batch of dispersal work is scheduled to begin today.</p>
<p>Refugees in Suburbs Still Request Accommodation</p>
<p>However, there are still thousands of refugees who have repeatedly submitted letters to the association requesting continued accommodation. The letters state that they are from the rural areas of Shanghai's suburbs, their homes have been destroyed, and the local areas have not yet been pacified, making it impossible to maintain a livelihood by returning home. Therefore, they request continued accommodation and apply not to be merged into other refugee camps, because the camps provide two meals of rice and free water and electricity, while self-sufficient refugee camps require payment for white rice. Therefore, the young and strong go out to work as peddlers and coolies, using their income to supplement their expenses. If they are moved to other camps, they will not be able to continue their occupations, making their lives even more difficult.</p>
<p>Only Difficulty, No Housing</p>
<p>Most of the housing in the association's refugee camps belongs to temples, monasteries, or local public property, such as the Railway Hospital on Bazilu, the Tianhou Palace on North Henan Road, the Yu Family Villa in Fahuadongzhen, and the 15th Refugee Camp on Haig Road, which are provided by homeowners who voluntarily allow refugees to live there. A refugee once stated that they can work as small laborers and peddlers, and women can also work in factories to maintain a livelihood. However, the most difficult thing after leaving the camp is having no housing. The places where we are currently sheltered are public property, so it is very necessary for enthusiastic charitable people to negotiate and continue to provide housing so that we do not have to wander the streets and live in the open.</p>
<p>Postponed for One Month, Then Closed</p>
<p>The person in charge of the association said to a reporter from the Dazhong News Agency yesterday that the organizers of the association originally planned to close at the end of this month due to financial difficulties, but because various tasks cannot be carried out as scheduled, it will be postponed to the end of next month. As for the affiliated First and Eleventh Refugee Camps, which were originally scheduled to close at the end of this month, but because it is difficult for refugees to find housing outside, it will be extended for a few days.</p>
<h3>F. Maze Returns to Shanghai Soon, This Trip Is to Inspect Customs Affairs</h3>
<p>F. Maze, Director-General of Customs of the Ministry of Finance, has been in Hong Kong for some time. According to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, Maze will return to Shanghai from Hong Kong in the shortest possible time. His duties at the Shanghai office of the Inspectorate General of Customs on Hede Road are currently being performed by Mr. G. Gamber, a British customs official from the General Affairs Section of the office. The Director-General of Customs usually inspects customs offices across the country in the spring and autumn, but since the outbreak of the war, Maze has not inspected North China due to the increasingly unstable situation. He visited South China last autumn, so his trip to Hong Kong this time is a routine inspection, and there are no other special circumstances.</p>
<h3>Bodyguard of British Director of the Public Works Department Murdered in Western Shanghai, Two Bullets Hit Vital Points and Resulted in Death, Perpetrator Escaped and the Police Are Intensively Searching</h3>
<p>At 9:20 AM yesterday morning, a shooting occurred near the Hollywood gambling den on Yu Yuan Road, a "bad land" in western Shanghai. The victim was a British bodyguard named Carine, who was shot twice on the spot and died. According to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Protecting the British Director</p>
<p>The British man, W.B. Carine, 50 years old, was a constable in the Shanghai Municipal Police. He was recently assigned to protect the personal safety of Mr. Haile, a British expatriate and manager of the Nei Dou Yang Jian Company, the new director of the current Public Works Department, at his residence at No. 15 Kaison Villa, Emei Yue Road, Yu Yuan Road. Since being assigned, Carine has been diligent in his service and fulfilled his duties.</p>
<p>Suddenly Shot</p>
<p>The Bu Nei Men Yang Jian Company is located at No. 133 Sichuan Road. Haile goes to the company every day to work, and Carine protects him. Yesterday was Sunday, Haile rested as usual, so Carine also had a day off. At 9:20 AM yesterday morning, Carine was walking in civilian clothes in the Emei Yue Road area when two thugs suddenly jumped out from the side of the road on the bridge over the small river. They immediately drew their pistols and fired four shots at Carine. Carine was caught off guard and was hit twice, once in the chest and once in the waist. He immediately collapsed to the ground, blood gushing out, and his breath was faint. He was seriously injured. The two thugs, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled into a nearby alley and disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>Seriously Wounded and Died</p>
<p>After the shooting occurred, the Jing'an Temple Police Department was informed and immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to the scene to investigate. They found bullet casings near the bridge on Emei Yue Road, took them back to the police station for research, and summoned an ambulance to take Carine to Hong En Hospital for treatment. However, because the injuries were to vital points, he died before he could be treated.</p>
<p>Police Hunt for the Perpetrator</p>
<p>The police authorities are currently investigating the reason for Carine's murder and are conducting an intensive search for the perpetrator to bring him to justice. Carine was usually careful and conscientious in his service and was well-known for his hard work. The police authorities and Mr. Haile deeply mourned his unfortunate death.</p>
<h3>Villagers in Qingpu County Massacred, Population Loss of Over a Thousand, Disaster-Stricken Refugees Beg for Relief</h3>
<p>It is reported that yesterday (the 27th), over 1,000 Japanese soldiers from Qingpu Zhudi, Panlong, Jiwangmiao, and Guanyintang towns arrived and were stationed in these areas. During the day, they gathered in the Qingpu-Shanghai Road area and resumed their burning and killing. Farmers who could not escape were killed, their blood flowed into the river, turning the water red. Many young women were captured and humiliated. On the same evening, the Japanese soldiers in Guanyintang set fire to the town, and most of the captured residents were burned to death. It is said that someone tried to stop them but was ignored. In one day, the number of innocent people killed reached four to five hundred, a scene of unprecedented cruelty. Guanyintang and Datieqiao are rice-producing areas in western Shanghai. It is early summer, the time for planting in the fields. This disturbance not only makes it impossible to plant in time, but also most of the farmers have been killed, and there will be a shortage of people to plant, which will have a great impact on the food supply in the nearby area. Today (the 28th), more Japanese soldiers continue to arrive in Zhudi, Jiwangmiao, and Panlong towns. The puppet troops are dealing with them, and there have been no incidents yet.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Search</p>
<p>The Japanese army is conducting a major search, harassing over 40 villages south of the road, such as Chentaixing, Zhu Jiahui, Louxia, Dujiahang, Pi Ku Laozhai, Yao Cunbang, Xixin Port, Liutu, Ershiba Tu, Datieqiao, Dujiahang, Wangjia Shiqiao, Caojiawan, etc. The captured farmers are tied up and taken to Tianshan, Mashan, Yushan, Fenghuangshan, Sijing, etc., numbering five to six hundred. Three to four hundred have already been slaughtered. The detained civilians are not given food, and they are subjected to cruel torture to force them to reveal the whereabouts of the Chinese army. If they fail to comply, they are immediately killed. The residents of each village are living in terror every day, not knowing if they will be alive the next day.</p>
<p>Terror Zone</p>
<p>Therefore, over 70 rural villages south of Qingpu-Shanghai Road, east of Qingsong Road, and north of Sijing have been evacuated. Although there have been no major battles, there are frequent encounters between the outposts of both sides. The terror situation is increasing. The corpses of people and animals emit a foul odor, which is truly appalling. It is said that enthusiastic people in Shanghai are now running around and appealing, raising funds from all walks of life for relief. It is hoped that philanthropists and fellow villagers from all walks of life will actively donate to quickly raise relief funds for this unprecedented war disaster. Here is the appeal for relief from the disaster-stricken people:</p>
<p>Appeal for Relief from Disaster-Stricken People</p>
<p>"Since the withdrawal of the national army to the west, the local areas have fallen. We refugees have endured hardship and suffering to the extreme. We were hoping to endure hardship and maintain a meager existence, but unexpectedly, the disaster of war struck again, and the city was devastated. Currently, there are over 70 disaster-stricken villages, with thousands of people dead, injured, and missing, and over 800 houses destroyed. We refugees have suffered this calamity and have no home to return to. We are scattered in neighboring areas or have traveled to Shanghai. Moreover, we cannot plant during this spring plowing season. Our homes have been destroyed, and the dead are gone, but what about the living? Therefore, we are appealing to enthusiastic people and fellow villagers from all walks of life, pleading for relief. Alas, sharing clothes and food is a common human sympathy, and good deeds will bring blessings, and Heaven is not far away. This is the appeal. Donations can be paid to the Xinhua Bank."</p>
<p>Panlong Escaped</p>
<p>According to a fellow villager from Sijing Town, Songjiang County, who came to Shanghai and spoke to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, the Japanese army's massacre and burning tragedy has spread to the villages of Liu Tu Yangzhai, Shitu Pengzhai, Heshangjing, Waipojing, Datieqiao, Hejiabang, etc., three to five miles north of Sijing Town. Because after the battle on Qingpu-Shanghai Road, a captain of the Japanese Gendarmerie went out on patrol in civilian clothes and was killed by the Chinese guerrillas in Liu Tu Yangzhai, and his body was abandoned in the river. After the officer went missing, the Japanese army searched everywhere without success. Several days later, the body was found in the river near Liu Tu Yangzhai. The Japanese army then pointed out that the area was the lair of Chinese guerrillas and that the Chinese army after the fierce battle on Qingpu-Shanghai Road might be hiding there. Therefore, they launched a major offensive, indiscriminate in their attacks, burning houses and killing people. The houses in more than a dozen surrounding villages have now been reduced to ashes, and countless women, children, and the elderly have been tragically killed. Only Panlong Town has survived.</p>

<h3>Although the Additional Tax Case Was Passed, It Is Still Hoped That the Implementation Can Be Postponed, Chinese Taxpayers Association Requests the Board to Consider, To Be Implemented When Prices Return to Normal</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's decision to increase taxes by 50% from July 1st of this year will inevitably stimulate continued price increases, cause rental disputes, and increase the market crisis. The public believes that this move by the Municipal Council completely contradicts the policy of suppressing prices and will greatly reduce or even nullify the effectiveness of suppressing prices. Although the case has been passed by the foreign taxpayers' annual meeting and is a foregone conclusion, most Chinese taxpayers still hope that the Municipal Council will consider the difficult times and temporarily postpone the implementation, and implement it after prices return to normal and the people's livelihood improves slightly, so that both the difficulties of the people and the case can be taken into account. It is heard that most taxpayers intend to ask the Chinese Taxpayers Association to forward their wishes to the Municipal Council for consideration.</p>
<h3>Zu Attacked Sige, Cai Wenlong Acquitted</h3>
<p>Huang Bugao, the Sige guard of the Shanghai New Hotel on Jiujiang Road, angered several tourists on March 18 due to a minor matter. On the 29th, at about 10 PM, three thugs came to find trouble, opened fire, and injured Huang in the arm and waist. They fled separately. The detective of the Huisi Police Department obtained information and arrested a suspect named Cai Wenlong from Haimen, and sent him to the First Special District Court. He firmly denied the charges. Yesterday, Judge Huang presided over the trial and acquitted Cai Wenlong. He was remanded in custody during the appeal period.</p>
<h3>Engineer Commits Suicide by Poisoning</h3>
<p>Wang Xiaoyuan, a native of Shaoxing, 26 years old, was an engineer at the Hefeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory at No. 3, Lane 455, Kangti Road. Recently, he often went to western Shanghai to gamble, resulting in huge losses and mounting debts, which he could not repay. He became despondent and bought a bottle of poison outside on the 25th and returned to the factory. At 6 PM in the evening, he swallowed the whole bottle and lay on the bed waiting to die. His colleague and fellow villager Wang Yan (24 years old) discovered it and told the accounting office. He was rushed to Baolong Hospital, but because he had been poisoned too deeply, the treatment was ineffective. He died at 8 PM on the 27th.</p>
<h3>New World Company Opened Dongchanghui Yesterday, Resolved to Distribute Dividend for the 28th Year</h3>
<p>The New World Company on Nanjing Road in Shanghai held its 15th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders in the West Restaurant on the 7th floor of the company at 9 AM yesterday. The shareholders who attended the meeting were very enthusiastic. First, Chairman Jin Zongcheng reported on the number of shares and the number of attendees, which was sufficient for the quorum, and gave an opening speech, saying that the company's business had reached a point of suffering coming to an end. The successive establishment of the Green Gem Theater, the New World Hotel, the New World Theater, and the Glass Radio Station this year were all created from hardship and difficulty. The business progress and reputation are increasing day by day. If it were not for General Manager Li's firm belief and effective management, and the sincere cooperation of all colleagues, it would not have been possible to achieve this. The profit last year was quite considerable, but the board of directors, in order to consolidate the company's foundation, intends to allocate more for amortization and depreciation and pay off preferred stock dividends. Only a slight distribution can be made on ordinary stock dividends. I hope that all shareholders will understand. However, our company is one of the domestic enterprises, and it cannot be fully developed by the power of a few people. I hope that all shareholders will not hesitate to give advice at any time, and the future development will be limitless. Then, General Manager Li Zejun reported on the business overview of the 28th year, saying that the business improved last spring, so he immediately engaged in the replenishment of goods and the creation of the New World Hotel, the Glass Radio Station, and the New World Theater. Due to the impact of the sharp contraction of foreign exchange, the bank's restrictions on loans, and excessive foreign exchange arbitrage, it was difficult to cope with. Fortunately, all the directors and colleagues were able to cooperate, and the business has made great progress. Statistics show that the annual profit is better than in previous years. In the future, the expansion of the business area will be carried out to seek further development. Then, the amendment to the articles of association was discussed. As a result, the draft submitted by the board of directors was passed. Immediately afterwards, the 15th board of directors and supervisors were elected. All shareholders believed that the original directors and supervisors were capable and efficient. As a result of the voting, all the original members were re-elected.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Over Rent Increase in Nanyang Li, Seymour Road, Plaintiff's Claim Rejected</h3>
<p>The houses in the Nanyang Li area of Seymour Road in Shanghai are the property of the New Sassoon Company. In August last year, all tenants were notified that the rent would be increased by 40% of the original amount. After mediation by the court failed, they filed a lawsuit in the Shanghai First Special District Local Court, demanding a 40% rent increase on the grounds of increased property prices and huge expenses. The tenants elected representatives and jointly hired lawyers Zhu Wende, Zhang Guangzong, and Mao Jiaju to defend them according to law. On the 22nd of this month, Judge Gui Yu held a hearing. After the debate in court was over, the judgment was scheduled for the 27th of this month. It is now learned that the case has been judged by Judge Gui. The main text: the plaintiff's claim and the application for provisional execution are rejected, and the litigation costs are borne by the plaintiff.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Police Officers to Extort the Poor, Residents Request Protection</h3>
<p>Behind Guifu Lane, Binlang Road, Tokyo Road, Donglipur Road, north of Yonghua Paint Factory, and west of Dajin Wire Factory in western Shanghai, there are five or sixty thatched sheds that have been there for many years. Since they were destroyed by fire last year, the residents have rebuilt tin-skinned bungalows on the land. The residents are mostly coolies or small business operators, struggling to survive after the disaster and living in peace. Unexpectedly, a certain Qi, impersonating a police officer, recently led many accomplices to the area and extorted money from house to house, calling it an inspection fee. It is now heard that the residents plan to have Dai Kegui and others submit a request to the Municipal Council for protection.</p>
<h3>South City: An Unbearable Memory</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Before the war, South City had dense residences and a fairly prosperous market. After the Nationalist army retreated westward, except for a portion of the northern district, which Father Jacquinot organized into a refugee zone as a safe haven, preserving the integrity of its houses and belongings, the rest of the residents fled, their belongings looted, and dilapidated houses and ruins were everywhere. Looking at the present compared to the past, one cannot help but feel a sense of profound vicissitude. I will now record what the reporter has seen and heard:</p>
<p>Ruinous Houses and Crumbling Walls – A Scene of Desolation</p>
<p>After the Japanese army occupied South City, local figures of some standing all fled. Local ruffians and hooligans seized the opportunity to rise up and colluded with the Japanese army, setting fires everywhere that lasted for two weeks, the flames refusing to die out. Therefore, apart from the refugee zone, the only areas that remained somewhat intact were the Peace Road, Zhaojia Road, Zhonghua Road, Xiaonanmen, and Dananmen areas near Laoximen. As for the areas starting from the Bund of the Sixteenth Ward, along Dongmen Road, Fangbang Road, the southern section of Zhonghua Road, Dongjie Sipailou, Guangqi Road, Sanpailou, Dadongmen, Zhaojia Road, Laoma Road, Xian Gua Street inside and outside, Chezhan Road outside Xiaoximen, Lujiabang, Zhizaoju Road, Xietu Road, Huining Road, and the Gaochang Temple area, they were all turned into scorched earth, with ruined houses and crumbling walls still visible today, presenting a desolate scene that one cannot bear to look at. Furthermore, the Haichao Temple at Dananmen, the original site of the Tushu Gongsi (Book Company) in Xinlu Village, the Fuan Company at Xiaodongmen, the Puyi Xi Yi Suo (Vocational Training Center) near the railway station, the Laishi Market on Penglai Road, the Wenmiao Park Library, the Minzhong Jiaoyu Guan (Public Education Center), Yeshi Garden, and the zoo were also destroyed in this cruel artillery fire. The local courthouse on Chezhan Road, which had stood alone amidst the scorched earth, was occupied by the Ogawa unit of the Japanese army. After their retreat, it caught fire for unknown reasons and was also burned down. Only one building in front of the gate remains, seemingly unworthy of providing shelter.</p>
<p>Rails and Utility Poles – Mostly Looted</p>
<p>After the Japanese army invaded South City, the South Railway Station was used as a military depot. All railway tracks, sleepers, and traffic signal equipment from the South Railway Station to Longhua were dismantled by the Japanese army. Except for the refugee zone and the area around Minguo Road, the utility poles along the city walls were nowhere to be seen. Even the copper wires laid on the tram tracks only remained from Xiaodongmen to Fangbang Bridge. All traffic, of course, was cut off for trains. Trams and buses disappeared from the city, marking the end of an era with the fall of the city. Recently, after South City was opened, the so-called "Huazhong Automobile Company" was established, with eight buses divided into two lines: one circling Minguo Road and the other from Laoximen along Xietu Road to Rihui Port. However, due to the sparse population, the number of passengers was very limited. As for rickshaws, there were only a few dozen at the beginning of the occupation, but they gradually increased to over 1,100. The motors of the original trams were all dismantled by the Japanese, leaving only broken-down car bodies in the factory.</p>
<p>Occupied Water and Electricity – Insufficient to Cover Expenses</p>
<p>The engine components of the China Merchants Electric Power Company were all occupied by a "Huazhong Water and Electric Linshi Association." After repairs, they continued to generate electricity in the same location, while their business department occupied the old site of the Shanghai Bank in Laoximen. The water supply also continued to be sourced from the inland water plant on Bansongyuan Road, with a "Water Management Office" set up in the old site of the Xinhua Bank on Peace Road. It is said that the monthly income from both utilities is about 60,000 yuan, a meager amount that is not enough to cover expenses, indicating the desolate state of residents and the decline of the market, resulting in a lack of usage despite the availability of supply.</p>
<p>Self-Proclaimed Bureaus – A Colorful Spectacle</p>
<p>After the Japanese army invaded South City, all formal government offices under the Nationalist government were relocated. Now, there are organizations daringly calling themselves "District Public Office," with Shen Shijing as "District Head," located in Shangwen Primary School. There is a "Court," with Yan Lunkuai as "President," located in Xicheng Primary School on Penglai Road. There is a "South City Police Branch," with Wang Zhizhang as "Chief," located in the County Chamber of Commerce in Xiaonanmen on Zhonghua Road. There is a "Yimiao Police Branch," with Zhu Jialin as "Chief," located in the Qingyun Silver Shop on Fangbang Road in Xiaodongmen. There is a "Xieqiao Police Branch," with Jin Dianyang as "Chief," located in a Western-style house at the intersection of Zhizaoju Road and Liyuan Road. There is a "Detective Team," with Zhao Yongsheng as "Team Leader," each located near the "Police Station." There is also a "National Salvation Army Headquarters," with Chen Fan as "Commander-in-Chief" and Lei Weimin as "Deputy Commander," located in the Hemingli neighborhood on the western end of Zhonghua Road. There is a "Youth Corps Security Team Headquarters," located in Shangwen Primary School. Other so-called "Public Utility Bureau Vehicle Donation Office" and "Finance Bureau Donation Office" are all located in the Minli Girls' Middle School on Wenmiao Road. It is truly a colorful spectacle, with nothing too strange to be seen.</p>
<p>Few Japanese Soldiers – Pseudo-Police Serving as Substitutes</p>
<p>To cope with mobile warfare in various locations, the entire South City is rarely seen with Japanese soldiers. Even the few present are stationed in the Rihui Port, Fenglin Bridge, and Longhua areas outside the city, with only a Kempeitai headquarters set up in the former Shanghai Municipal Police Department on Penglai Road. "Kempeitai Outposts" are also established at five locations: Minguo Road, Xinkaihe (formerly the Wireless Telegraph Bureau), Luxiangyuan Road intersection, Nanyang Bridge, and Xieqiao. In addition, a so-called "Kenzo Team" is also set up, whose members are selected from the pseudo-police to assist the Kempeitai in their duties.</p>
<p>Tigers and Wolves in Power – Thorns Everywhere</p>
<p>The so-called "military police" are only ostensibly so. During the day, they put on a show to deceive people, but they disappear at night, nowhere to be seen. They neither stand guard nor patrol. As a result, petty criminals thrive, and theft is rampant. It is even heard that the police, under the guise of searching, openly break into people's homes, overturning boxes and cabinets to search for belongings, leaving the entire public order completely unprotected. Although South City is open, allowing people to live there, hoping that the evacuating citizens would return home, it has only become a dream. Many property owners have posted notices, ordering tenants to pay rent, but the tenants, due to the lack of recovery in the market, are unable to pay and are taking a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<p>Willingly Abandoning Education – Seeking Other Professions</p>
<p>The post office was once suspended but resumed operations in March of last year at two locations, Huajin Road and Laoximen, but only for delivering mail, not for remittances. As for education, there is only one middle school, the so-called "Special Municipality Municipal Second Middle School," located in Shangwen Primary School, and five primary schools, all borrowing the old sites of Yangzheng, Cangji, Meixi, Zijin, and Zhuyu Ye. With such a large area having only two post offices, one middle school, and five primary schools, residents find it inconvenient. However, because education has become a tool for enslavement, many young people are willingly abandoning their education, wasting their precious time to find other professions, showing that the spirited youth are not entirely without ambition even in this situation.</p>
<h3>The Adventures of Pinocchio (Translated)</h3>
<p>The feature-length cartoon "The Adventures of Pinocchio," currently showing at the Nanjing Grand Theater and the Shanghai Grand Theater, is a famous Italian fairy tale that has long been popular around the world, translated into several languages. The Chinese translation was done long ago by Mr. Xu Diaofu and published by Kaiming Bookstore. It has been sold for more than ten years, and almost all progressive elementary schools use it as extracurricular reading material. It is heard that the original translator has revised it again, seeking to make the language more suitable for elementary school students, and reprinted it in a new No. 4 font, making it very beautiful. The book contains over a hundred illustrations, which are also masterpieces by famous Italian painters, no less than the cartoon. Whether you have seen the film or not, you should read this book.</p>

<h3>An Overview of the Self-Help Handicraft Work Undertaken by Christians in South City</h3>
<p>The self-help handicraft work undertaken by Christians in South City has been in operation for about two years. Although not many people know about it, their work is of great significance to refugees. The central task of this self-help movement is called "Charitable Handicraft," using work-relief to replace "idle consumption." That is, using everyone's skills to transform simple consumption into circular production, with a spirit of self-help, helping others, and mutual cooperation, seeking a way of life through self-reliance.</p>
<p>The promotion of a movement, no matter how perfect the principles, how thorough the system, or how hard the people in charge work, it is difficult to achieve anything without the support of all parties and constant maintenance. The fact that the Christian self-help movement has achieved a preliminary foundation in South City today is not only due to the great power of this work-relief movement, but also due to the support of a group of enthusiastic people in society.</p>
<p>According to the report from Secretary-General Peng, in the past three months, since the opening of South City, more and more people have returned to their former residences, and coarse handicrafts and small businesses have begun to recover. The difficult problem to solve is that poverty continues to be extremely widespread, and the meager wages that self-help handicrafts can provide to workers, the number of people in need is calculated in the thousands, truly a case of too many people and not enough food.</p>
<p>There are enthusiastic people in this area and abroad who sponsor self-help relief, but there are not many organizations, and it is urgent to promote it. For example, a total of 400 "charity bags" have been sent out, but the actual number of clothes and odd items received each month is only about one hundred. These quantities are insufficient in any case, if we want to increase both the production and sales of handicrafts.</p>
<p>The scope of donations from various parties to the group is still wide, including various manufacturing raw materials, medicines, clothing, and food. In the three months since the beginning of this year, the value of various items converted into cash is 5,119.50 yuan in Chinese currency. This includes cotton yarn, steamed buns, medicines, cod liver oil, clothing, coal, etc. Some factories give them preferential treatment when they purchase raw materials.</p>
<p>In the spring of this year, Chinese individuals and organizations donated a total of 991.37 yuan; 30 Westerners donated 691.85 yuan; and enthusiastic people from abroad sent 3,461.62 yuan. The monthly income from the sale of the group's workshop products and horticultural products is about 1,173.00 yuan. The total monthly income, including church funds, is about 5,000 yuan, and the expenditure is about 4,800 yuan.</p>
<p>Various works are sometimes suspended or prospered according to the supply of raw materials and seasonal conditions. Recently, they hired Mr. Lian Yousan as an employee, preparing to expand various works, such as machine-made socks. They already have the upper part of the knitting machine, but they hope that the workers can buy the machine themselves.</p>
<p>Spiritual cultivation is also a kind of contribution they give to the workers. Almost all employees participate in morning and evening prayers. On Sundays, Mr. Zhang preaches, and a total of 21 workers have been baptized by Pastor Tang. The staff in charge of Sunday school are particularly enthusiastic about evangelizing to children.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned work-relief, they also provide relief to the sick and the very poor, providing food, clothing, medicine or cash, totaling 744 pieces of clothing, 1,807 pounds of rice, and 94.90 yuan in cash. Special attention is paid to workers who are sick or giving birth.</p>
<p>A total of 4,000 people received free medical treatment in this quarter. The most common diseases among children are eye diseases, skin diseases, and lice infestation. In addition, bathing facilities are often provided for children and infants.</p>
<p>About 220 workers' children are educated there. They get free lunch, and thanks to the teachers' attention, the children's health and discipline have improved significantly. They also run a nursery, which has resulted in increased work performance for female workers and healthier children.</p>
<p>The purpose of "self-help relief" is to enable a group of men and women who can still support themselves to acquire considerable skills and manufacturing raw materials, and gradually enable them to make a living. Therefore, this independent handicraft group, on the one hand, invites people with specialized skills to teach work, so that refugees can develop production capabilities; on the other hand, it pays wages to those who can work, so that they can make a living.</p>
<p>They often use one or two meals a day as wages for workers. From the beginning of January to the end of March, a total of 24,123 meals were provided to workers and child laborers. The average value of each meal is 20 cents. Fortunately, they have their own garden, and the supply of vegetables was very sufficient in February and March. During these three months, 3,636 bowls of tofu paste were sold, charging one cent per bowl.</p>
<p>The average number of workers employed during this period was 250, including 40 men, 2 teachers, various assistants, and 10 hawkers—receiving skilled workers' wages, several cooks, and unskilled workers. Most of the female workers are unskilled, and can get a monthly salary of 10.5 yuan, including meals. There are a total of 174 such female workers. 46 skilled workers receive 15.6 yuan per month, and 3 people receive 19.2 yuan, and 2 people receive 21.2 yuan. But in fact, the benefits that workers get are more than that, because most of them can get free medical treatment, free education, if they are ten clothes, and provide workers' children with food. The daily working time is only five and a half hours. The number of working days in spring is 16.846 days, and workers are paid wages for sick or childbirth leave.</p>
<p>The employment of self-help handicrafts is roughly as follows: teaching, foremen in the factory, clerks, medical assistants, cooking, boiling water and fetching water, childcare, washing, ironing, dyeing, weaving, spinning, cotton batting, sorting cloth pieces, tying mops, weaving felt, sewing, sewing shoe soles, making cloth shoes, repairing leather shoes, making straw sandals, woodworking, painting utensils and toys, and other miscellaneous work such as mounting paintings, nailing books, making noodles, grinding grain, peddling, knitting socks and gardening, etc.</p>
<h3>Gatekeeper's Pistol Snatched</h3>
<p>The gatekeeper surnamed Xu, from Yangzhou, who lived at No. 746, Lane 255, Rue Jassou, Louza, French Concession, was on duty as a guard and had a Blanc-Levin pistol issued by the police station for defense against bandits. At 11 p.m. the previous night, when Officer Xu was on duty, two robbers suddenly came, grabbed Officer Xu without asking any questions, and forcibly snatched the pistol he was wearing and a few bullets from the gun, and fled out of the alley. The officer reported to the Louza Central Police Station to request an investigation.</p>
<h3>Maid Abuse Fine</h3>
<p>Wang Gu's (28 years old), a woman from Suzhou who lived at No. 11, Lane 520, North Suzhou Road, beat her 13-year-old maid Tang A'mei with a cane in her residence on the afternoon of the 25th of this month for a trivial matter, causing injury. Tang girl could not bear the pain and cried for help. The gatekeeper No. 632 in the lane heard about it and reported it to the police station. Wang Gu's was arrested. The victim was sent to the hospital and it was confirmed that she had severe stick wounds on her face, neck, legs, hips, etc. She was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court and prosecuted for abuse under Article 286, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Judge Jiang presided over the trial. The defendant Wang Gu's admitted to the beating and was sentenced to a fine of 200 yuan, which could be commuted to labor service, with 2 yuan offsetting one day. The victim was sent to the Jiliang Institute for care.</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Director of Sichuan Education Department, Guo Youshou, Publishes Report on Inspection of Various Counties; Funding Increased by One Time Compared to Last Year; Teaching and Management Generally Satisfactory</h3>
<p>(Chengdu Aviation News) Guo Youshou, Director of the Education Department, went to Shuangliu, Pengshan, Meishan, Jiajiang, Emei, Leshan and other counties on April 14 to inspect education, and returned to Chengdu on the evening of the 17th. According to Guo, the situation and feelings of this inspection are as follows: (1) The education funds budget of each county this year has increased by one time compared with last year. (2) The "special account management" of education funds in each county has not been fully implemented, and the audit committees of education funds have not been established. (3) The procedures for issuing education funds still require teachers to go to the county seat to collect funds, which interferes with the curriculum. (4) The teaching and management of primary school education are generally suitable, but a few private schools do not pay much attention to labor, physical education, music and other subjects, and even have schools that do not include physical education courses. As for the curriculum schedule, there is still a class hour system. (5) The spirit of the principals and teachers of secondary schools is generally good, but the funding of county middle schools has not followed the new standards for payment of county middle school funds issued by the province due to the difficulty in raising funds. The internal affairs of students are generally poor except for one or two schools, which urgently need to be improved in the future. (6) The equipment of primary and secondary schools is very simple, and some are completely without it. (7) Each county now has considerable plans for the implementation of universal national schools. In about one year, each bao can set up a national school. They will be implemented in the second half of this year or the first half of next year. Central schools will be fully established after July this year. According to the fund-raising methods stipulated by the central government, the provincial government will urge the completion of national education within three years. (8) The organization and division of townships in each county are generally planned, but the number of school-age children, out-of-school children, and out-of-school people is not very accurate. After instructions, they are starting to plan an investigation. (9) The treatment of primary school teachers has now been increased compared with last year. After the implementation of the new school system, it can be increased to 18 yuan and even more than 35 yuan. (10) The county heads and middle-level education personnel in each county are still working hard for education, but there are also cases where the spirit is slightly lax. (11) The equipment of the public education centers in each county is very poor, and most of them passively display books and lack active public guidance. Regarding the aspects that should be improved in the above points, Guo has given separate instructions. Every time he arrives at a place, he also informs the county heads and education officials to pay special attention to raising education funds, training teachers, and earnestly investigating the number of out-of-school children and out-of-school people when implementing the new county system, and to create a distribution chart of central schools and national schools.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Provincial Government Issues Order to All Schools to Add Military Service Courses, Specifies Several Reference Materials</h3>
<p>(Chengdu Aviation News) The Ministry of Military Affairs stipulates that military service is a sacred obligation that citizens should fulfill. Schools should add military service courses. The provincial government has issued an order to follow, and specified several reference materials. The original order is as follows: 1. The Education Department submitted a case stating that the Ministry of Education's telegram dated October 12, 1939, approved the Ministry of Military Affairs' consultation, stating that serving in military service is a sacred obligation that citizens should fulfill. Schools should add military service courses for students. Please instruct the Education Departments to obtain materials from the command headquarters in their respective jurisdictions to compile and distribute lectures, etc. In addition to sending telegrams, they should obtain materials on military service from the command headquarters of the military control area in each province, and compile and supplement teaching materials to distribute to schools at all levels, and teach them in civics courses. The department should also obtain nine types of materials related to military service from the conscription office of the military control area, except for two types of Sichuan Military Service Overview and Compilation of Military Service Laws and Regulations, which are sold in bookstores and should be purchased by schools themselves. The remaining seven types, including the Provisional Regulations on the Organization of Army Officers' Conferences in Rural Areas, the Provisional Regulations on the Management of Army Soldiers in Rural Areas, the Revised Provisional Regulations on Military Service Law, the Sichuan Province's Second Lottery Implementation Method for Public Conscription in Extraordinary Times, the Sichuan Province's Interim Measures for Handling Desertion, the Sichuan Province's Implementation Details for Preferential Treatment of Families of Soldiers Fighting Against Japan, and the Sichuan Province's Interim Measures for Conscription Money in Extraordinary Times, have now been printed. Each type will be attached to one copy, and you are ordered to forward it to all primary schools under your jurisdiction as reference materials and for compiling supplementary teaching materials. This order.</p>
<h3>Children's Day Preparatory Committee Prints and Distributes Report on Committee Affairs</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Ninth Children's Day Preparatory Committee held a closing meeting a few days ago and printed and distributed a report on the committee's work. Regarding the establishment of a children's library, the committee originally planned to order 100,000 children's welfare badges, but due to time constraints and the spring break of the schools, only 40,000 children's welfare badges were ordered. As of April 27, the committee had received 2,847 yuan, one dime and eight cents in donations for the children's library. In addition, the committee hopes to reach the number of 4,000 yuan soon, including donations from all parties. All temporary receipts will be issued each time a donation is received. As for formal receipts, they must be signed and sealed by the executive chairmen Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, and Wu Weide before they can be issued one after another. All the donations raised by the Children's Day Preparatory Committee will be transferred to the Children's Library Preparatory Committee. The former hopes that the latter will launch a large-scale fundraising plan for a longer period of time, and strive to fully realize the ideal of establishing a children's library before December 31, 1940. In addition, the closing meeting of the Children's Day Preparatory Committee authorized the Director-General Chen Zhengfan to continue handling the acceptance of donations, and must complete the liquidation before May 30. After Huang Jingwan audits the accounts, all donations will be transferred to the Children's Library Preparatory Committee.</p>
<h3>Five School Journalism Departments Establish Alumni Association</h3>

Then, alumni from various schools successively gave speeches, creating a very enthusiastic atmosphere.  Several proposals were also passed regarding the organization of the Shanghai Journalism Society and the publication of the Journalism Journal. The meeting was adjourned after a group photo was taken around 5 p.m.</p>
<h3>Overview of Adult Education Implementation in Guizhou Province (4)</h3>
<p>(3) Remuneration: Full-time teachers are the principle for adult education classes. Each teacher must teach two classes per day. In addition to the guidance director of the central foundation school receiving their original salary, the other transferred teachers will receive at least ten yuan per month for living expenses, and an additional five yuan for each class completed. Teachers in adult education classes organized by secondary schools and cultural and industrial organizations will not receive subsidies. During their service period, adult education teachers shall be exempt from labor and military service obligations.</p>
<p>(6) Curriculum and Teaching Materials</p>
<p>(1) Curriculum: There are two main implementation principles for adult education this year: First, equal emphasis should be placed on political training, literacy training, and life skills training. Second, efforts should be made to coordinate with the mobilization and training work of the people in the war zone. Based on these two principles, the curriculum for adult education classes includes five subjects: Anti-Japanese War Speeches (including memorial weeks), Mandarin Chinese, Current Affairs Reports, Anti-Japanese War Songs, and Assembly Activities. The weekly teaching time allocation is shown in the table below: Monday has three lessons in total, which are Premier's Memorial Week (25 minutes), Mandarin Chinese (50 minutes), and Mandarin Chinese (25 minutes). Monday has three lessons in total, which are Anti-Japanese War Speeches, Mandarin Chinese, and Anti-Japanese War Songs. Wednesday has three lessons in total, which are Current Affairs Reports, Mandarin Chinese, and Writing Practice. Thursday has three lessons in total, which are Anti-Japanese War Speeches, Mandarin Chinese, and Anti-Japanese War Songs. Friday has three lessons in total, which are Current Affairs Reports, Mandarin Chinese, and Writing Practice. Saturday has three lessons in total, which are Anti-Japanese War Speeches, Mandarin Chinese, and Anti-Japanese War Songs. Sunday has three lessons in total, which are Mandarin Chinese exercises, Mandarin Chinese, and Assembly Activities (all the above times are the same as on Monday).</p>
<p>(2) Teaching Materials: The content of the teaching materials for each subject in adult education classes is based on the above principles and strives to meet the needs of wartime. Anti-Japanese War Speeches are based on the book "How the People Should Resist Japan," compiled and printed by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. A simplified version of the "Lectures on How the People Should Resist Japan" will be compiled and distributed to adult education teachers for elaboration and lectures. Mandarin Chinese uses the "People's School Textbook" compiled and printed by the Ministry of Education, with completing 60 lessons as the standard. However, from the third term of adult education classes onwards, 40 lessons will be the minimum standard. In September, because the textbook was insufficient, another one million copies of "How the People Should Resist Japan" were printed and distributed as substitutes. Current Affairs Reports are based on the information issued by the provincial government every day and various daily newspapers. The provincial government also compiled and printed methods for Current Affairs Reports and distributed them to teachers for reference. Anti-Japanese War Songs include the national anthem, the Volunteer Army March, the Conscription Song, the Training Militia Song, Defend Our Homeland, Training Strong Men, Guerrilla Song, and Fight the Japanese, totaling eight songs, later changed to nine songs. All adult education students must be able to sing them fluently. The content of assembly activities is designed and conducted by the teacher based on "Examples of Social Activities for Adult Education Classes." "Guidance Methods for Social Activities in Adult Education Classes" are also issued for teachers to use.</p>

<h3>Miniature Football Upset: Lido Lost to Jingxiang Yesterday; Youyou drew with East Cercle, Portuguese Merchants Defeated Zhenyou</h3>
<p>Fourteen matches were played yesterday in the Zhen Dan Cup miniature football tournament, in both Group A and Group B. In the three Group A matches, Youyou and the British Army were evenly matched and ended in a draw. Zhenyou, due to the absence of too many key players, was unable to defeat the Portuguese merchants. In the final match, Lido was surprisingly defeated by Jingxiang.</p>
<p>Jingxiang Creates an Upset</p>
<p>In the pivotal match between Lido and Jingxiang, Jingxiang's reputation was already evident. Lido, due to fatigue from their previous match against the French Army the day before, and a lack of proper team formation, conceded the first goal in the 22nd minute when Jingxiang's right-winger Zheng Quchun kicked the ball into the corner of the goal from the crowd. Eight minutes later, center forward He Sirong scored again, giving Jingxiang a two-goal lead. Jingxiang led by two goals at halftime. After the change of ends, Lido launched a fierce attack, making Jingxiang the target. Unfortunately, Lido's luck was not good. In the 14th minute, Captain Sun created an opening, and Jiang Chao kicked the ball into the corner of the net from seven yards out, pulling one goal back. Although Jingxiang was under pressure for 35 minutes in the second half, they ultimately won 2-1, creating a major upset. Jingxiang's players were: Wu Hanxiang, Zhou Rongyi, Liu Guocai, Li William, Xiao Guanrong, He Sirong, and Zheng Yaochun.</p>
<p>Lido's players were: Zheng Tongyu, Yan Shixin, Jiang Chao, Cai Shengsen, Le Xiuhua, Sun Jinshun, Zhang Mingsheng, and Meng Yiliang.</p>
<p>Youyou Draws with East Cercle</p>
<p>The opening match between Youyou and East Cercle was full of excitement. After about ten minutes of stalemate, Cao Qinfang scored the first goal. At halftime, Youyou led by only one goal thanks to Cao Qinfang's valuable kick. After the change of ends, East Cercle brought on fresh troops in Lao Ling. Lao Ling advanced on the left and Pail rushed in, tying the score. The final result was a 1-1 draw. East Cercle's players were: Mauris, Harrisson, Arnault, Gelaire, Lao Ling, Macleod, Kinsellaire, and Pail.</p>
<p>Youyou's players were: Tao Ziming, Zhou Qilin, Chen Xiaoping, Wang Zhangbao, Wu Binghao, Cao Qinfang, and Zhao Yongfang.</p>
<p>Portuguese Merchants Triumphant</p>
<p>The Portuguese merchants led Zhenyou 3-1 at halftime. In the second half, the Portuguese merchants added two more goals, winning 5-2. The Portuguese merchants' players were: M. Surroca, C. Remiddi, J. Remiddi, Sheffer, V. Surroca, B. Remiddi, and Gain.</p>
<p>Zhenyou's players were: Hulfei, Yu Zhendong, Xu Rizhao, Xu Ridong, Bobov, Lü Beck, Kareku, and Yang Hongkui.</p>

<h3>Economic Special Issue</h3>
<p>— Gao Chongbo</p>
<p>The establishment of concessions in Shanghai originated from the Treaty of Nanjing after the Opium War; it has only been 97 years since then. Initially, there were separate British, American, and French concessions. Ten years before the founding of the Republic of China, the British and American concessions merged into the International Settlement. Thus, the Shanghai concessions became a collective term for the International Settlement and the French Concession. Over the years, the population has increased, and municipal administration has improved, making it one of the world's famous commercial ports, forming the distribution center of China's commerce and finance. In this extraordinary time and special environment, the finances of the concessions are naturally full of difficulties. Public bonds are used to make up for the shortfall. I would like to take a historical and numerical approach to study the overview of Shanghai's concession bonds, which I believe will be welcomed by comrades in the economic field.</p>
<p>(1) Total Amount Issued Before and After: The International Settlement issued silver tael bonds and national currency bonds. The total amount was 47,229,945 yuan in national currency. The French Concession issued eleven silver tael bonds and one national currency bond. The total amount was 25,740,839 yuan in national currency. The total amount of public debt for both concessions was 72,970,784 yuan.</p>
<p>(2) Earliest Issue and Latest Repayment: The French Concession first issued public bonds one year before the founding of the Republic of China. The International Settlement began to solicit public bonds in the 15th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>The final repayment date for the International Settlement's public bonds is 1967; the final repayment date for the French Concession's public bonds is 1964.</p>
<p>(3) High and Low Market Prices of Public Bonds: The highest price for the International Settlement's public bonds was 90 yuan per 100 yuan in 1926. The lowest price was 76 yuan per 100 yuan in 1937. The highest price for the French Concession's public bonds was 101.5 yuan per 100 yuan in 1911. The lowest price was 73 yuan per 100 yuan in 1934. In general, the rise and fall depend on the interest rate.</p>
<p>The contents of the public bonds of the two concessions over the years and the recent fundraising of 16 million yuan of public debt in the International Settlement will be described in detail below:</p>
<p>Public Bonds Raised by the International Settlement Public Works Bureau</p>
<p>(1) 6% Silver Tael Bonds from 1926, with 4,880,000 taels still outstanding. Interest is paid in June and December each year. The market price was 90 taels per 100 taels. It is scheduled to be fully repaid before 1956.</p>
<p>(2) 5% Silver Dollar Bonds from 1934, totaling 10,040,700 yuan. The principal was originally scheduled to be repaid between 1944 and 1964. Interest is paid in June and December each year. The market price was 77 yuan per 100 yuan.</p>
<p>(3) 5.5% Silver Dollar Bonds from 1936, totaling 5,000,000 yuan. The principal was originally scheduled to be repaid after 1946. Interest is paid in June and December each year. The market price was 81 yuan per 100 yuan.</p>
<p>(4) 5% Silver Dollar Bonds from 1937, totaling 9,000,000 yuan. The principal was originally scheduled to be repaid between 1947 and 1967. Interest is paid in June and December each year. The market price was 76 yuan per 100 yuan.</p>
<p>(5) 6% Public Bonds from 1940, totaling 16,000,000 yuan. Calculated in Chinese currency commonly used in Shanghai. The principal is scheduled to be repaid between 1941 and 1950. Interest is paid at the end of June and the end of December each year. The guarantee for repayment of the principal and payment of interest is the franchise fee paid by Shanghai Power Company and Shanghai Water Company after the price increase. Like other public bonds, it is guaranteed by the general assets of the Public Works Bureau. When issued, the price was 95% of the face value.</p>
<p>The above silver tael bonds of the International Settlement total 4,880,000 taels. According to the exchange rate of 7.15 issued by the Ministry of Finance of the National Government, the value is 6,820,052,445 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>In addition, the International Settlement has four national currency bonds, totaling 40,040,700 yuan. Combined with the silver tael bonds, the total is 47,229,945 yuan.</p>

<p>In addition, the French Concession has two national currency bonds, totaling 7,500,000 yuan. Combined with the silver tael bonds, the total is 25,740,839 yuan.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on Yarn Prices (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Ma Zhaorong</p>
<p>The yarn prices discussed here are not about the rise and fall of yarn prices, but about the high and low of prices. Why are the selling prices of brands such as Jin Cheng and Shuang Ma so high? Especially Te Jin Cheng. This is related to the quality of the yarn and the reputation of the factory.</p>
<p>How to judge the quality of yarn? Here are some main conditions: 1. Tensile strength (i.e., strength), 2. Evenness, 3. Color, 4. Twist. Yarn with high tensile strength, even texture, white color, and moderate twist is good quality yarn. Conversely, the quality is inferior.</p>
<p>What does the tensile strength of yarn mean? Tensile strength is the force required to break the yarn. Applying force within this limit will not cut it. The greater this force, the less it can support and the more likely it will break. Therefore, high tensile strength is a requirement for most buyers.</p>
<p>Since high tensile strength is commonly sought by buyers, manufacturers can increase it as much as possible. However, increasing tensile strength is related to the manufacturer's production cost, so the tensile strength of yarn produced by different factories varies.</p>
<p>Why does the tensile strength of yarn vary? This is related to raw materials, twist, machinery, and management. The raw material of yarn is cotton, and cotton fibers vary in length. Long fibers are better than short fibers, and yarn spun from them has higher tensile strength. However, because the quality is good, the price is high. High prices increase the cost of yarn, so the quality of raw materials is also limited by cost considerations. The length standard for ordinary spinning fibers is roughly as follows: 7/8 inch for 16 counts or less. 1 inch for 17-26 counts. 1 1/16 inch for 27-36 counts. 1 1/8 inch for 37-44 counts. 1 1/16 inch for 45-52 counts. 1 1/4 inch for 53-61 counts. 1 5/16 inch for 61-70 counts. 1 3/8 inch for 71-78 counts. 1 7/16 inch for 79-85 counts. 1 1/2 inch for 86-100 counts.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the price of raw materials should be reduced as much as possible, and on the other hand, the tensile strength should be fully increased. This difficult task requires the expertise of textile technicians. Textile technicians often adopt the characteristics of various fibers and blend several suitable raw cottons together, which can take into account costs and increase tensile strength.</p>
<p>As for twist, under normal circumstances, more twist can increase tensile strength. However, too much is also not suitable, as the yarn becomes wrinkled and stiff.</p>
<p>Speaking of machinery, it also has a great impact on tensile strength. New machines spin better than old ones. Belt-driven large drafting machines are better than ordinary machines. Because the spun yarn is more even, the tensile strength is greater.</p>
<p>What about management? It also has a considerable impact. If workers do not follow the work procedures and methods, or the temperature and humidity are not properly adjusted, or the drafting (elongation) of each machine is not properly distributed, the tensile strength of the spun yarn will undoubtedly be worse.</p>
<p>How is the tensile strength measured? The method used by yarn factories is as follows: Place one hank of yarn on a tensile strength machine. After the machine is started, wait for the yarn to break, and then read the tensile strength from the machine's indicator.</p>
<p>What kind of yarn is a hank? Winding the yarn 80 turns on a yarn reeling machine with a frame of one and a half yards long is called a hank. The length of one hank of yarn is 120 yards.</p>
<p>If you don't have a tensile strength machine, you can use a spring scale instead. Tie one end of the hank to a nail, hook the other end to the spring scale, and then pull the spring scale forcefully. At the same time, pay attention to the indicator on the scale. After a part of the yarn breaks, you can read the tensile strength of the yarn. The tensile strength of ordinary yarn varies greatly. The tensile strength of yarn supplied to the factory for weaving is very high, while the tensile strength of yarn for sale can be much lower. The approximate tensile strength in pounds for yarn for sale is as follows: 80 pounds for 10 counts. 70 pounds for 16 counts. 60 pounds for 20 counts. 50 pounds for 32 counts. 40 pounds for 40 counts.</p>
<p>Evenness affects the weaving of fabrics. If the yarn is even, weaving is easier, and the woven fabric is smooth and without defects. If the yarn is clean, the woven fabric is also clean. This has a great impact on the selling price of the fabric. What counts as evenness? It can be considered even when the difference in thickness of the yarn is minimal. As for cleanliness, there should be few leaf scraps and broken seeds on the yarn. How can it be even, and how can it be clean? This depends on the spinning technology.</p>
<p>How to test the evenness? The method used by yarn factories is to wind the yarn to be tested on a yarn board machine onto a black board. The yarn is tightly attached, and the yarn is clearly displayed on the black background. Whether the yarn is even or not can be compared at a glance.</p>
<h3>Market Intelligence Consultant</h3>
<p>Mr. Ling Yaogong asked: I have three questions and respectfully request answers to clarify the facts:</p>
<p>(1) The market price of Japanese gold notes in Shanghai is 1.30 yuan in legal tender for one yuan. However, a telegraphic transfer from HSBC of 100 yuan in legal tender only equals about 25 yuan in Japanese currency. Why is there such a huge difference? Otherwise, directly carrying cash to Japan would definitely be profitable.</p>
<p>(2) The discount fee for each thousand yuan of telegraphic transfer is now more than one hundred yuan. If I plan to deposit funds in the bank for long-term fixed savings, can I first purchase the bank's telegraphic transfer notes and then deposit the telegraphic transfer notes at face value? Will the bank refuse to accept them?</p>
<p>(3) What is foreign exchange arbitrage?</p>
<p>Wang Qin answers:</p>
<p>(1) The former is the price of Japanese banknotes, and the latter is the exchange rate of Japanese currency. Normally, the market price of foreign currency and the exchange rate of foreign currency should not differ so greatly. However, Japan, which is experiencing severe inflation, is an exception. This is because once Japanese banknotes leave Japan, they are like being exiled and are not allowed to return. These Japanese banknotes, which are not recognized once they leave the country, will naturally depreciate drastically, which is a natural result. The exchange rate of Japanese gold displayed by HSBC is calculated based on the official Japanese rate. Because the official exchange rate of Japanese gold still maintains a level of around 23.5 yuan against the US dollar, Japanese gold appears expensive when exchanged with legal tender, which is implementing a devaluation policy. Moreover, the exchange rate quoted by HSBC is essentially a black market rate, so the exchange rate of Shanghai to Japan is much higher than the price of Japanese banknotes. Simply put: One yuan of Japanese banknotes bought with 1.30 yuan of legal tender is cheap paper that even the Japanese themselves do not want. This is because Japan refuses to import it. As for the Japanese drafts of about 25 yuan bought with 100 yuan of legal tender, they can be remitted to Japan and used for deposits, payments, or purchases of goods in Japan, which is completely different in purpose from the aforementioned Japanese banknotes.</p>
<p>(2) The bank can do so, but only telegraphic transfers can be withdrawn upon maturity. If legal tender is required, the telegraphic transfer discount rate on the date of withdrawal must be paid.</p>
<p>(3) Foreign exchange arbitrage refers to the act of investing in buying low-priced spot goods and simultaneously selling high-priced futures, and then delivering the goods after a certain period of time to obtain a surplus.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Xilin asked: Please take the time to reply to the following questions, I would be very grateful:</p>
<p>(1) In the commercial news price list of various currencies in your newspaper, there are the following items:</p>
<p>Pound Sterling 114.00 Hong Kong Dollar 3.52</p>
<p>Pound Draft 53.40 French Franc 0.29</p>
<p>US Dollar 118.50 and so on</p>
<p>US Draft 14.45</p>
<p>I don't know if the market price is 114 yuan in legal tender for one pound of British gold? And 118.50 yuan in legal tender for one US dollar? How are British and American drafts calculated? I would especially appreciate a detailed explanation of the location and procedures for buying and selling them.</p>
<p>(2) Are there any British one-shilling silver coins, and one-pound and half-pound gold coins, and American five-dollar and ten-dollar gold coins, and one-dollar and half-dollar silver coins for sale in Shanghai now? Where can they be bought?</p>
<p>(3) Where is the current foreign exchange black market (i.e., the kerb market) located? Are the trading procedures the same as those of the exchange (i.e., through brokers)? Or are they purchased directly from banks? Was there such an organization before the war?</p>
<p>(4) Where is the current location for cash trading in Shanghai and what are the procedures?</p>
<p>Wang Xiangqin answers:</p>
<p>(1) Yes, the above are all kerb market prices for each foreign currency converted into national currency. If you have no commercial needs, that is, if you have no legitimate purpose, please do not try it lightly. This is because this type of market has now been manipulated by speculators. If you participate in it, it is not only an illegal act, but also a risk of losing your entire fortune. At the very least, you will have to sacrifice a commission every time you enter and exit.</p>
<p>(2) Yes, there are. But if you have surplus funds, it is still more beneficial to deposit them in the bank.</p>
<p>(3) The foreign exchange market refers to an abstract area for buying and selling international drafts. This type of market originally had no specific market organization, nor a fixed gathering place. As for the name "black market," it only existed during the war, because the prices for buying and selling drafts were not calculated according to official prices, but according to kerb market prices, hence the name. The components of the Shanghai foreign exchange market include foreign banks, Chinese banks, import and export firms, foreign exchange brokers, and investors and speculators. In normal times, buying and selling are divided into spot and futures. Spot is settled on the same day, and futures are settled at the end of the month. Futures are more expensive than spot. Opening hours: 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM every day. There is no market in the afternoon on Wednesdays and Saturdays, and no market all day on Sundays. If you want to buy, you can directly order from banks and money houses, or you can ask a broker to buy it for you. However, you must pay the prescribed commission for both buying and selling. In times of intense speculation and rapid price fluctuations, there is also a high risk of loss, so if you have no legitimate purpose, it is better not to try it lightly.</p>
<p>(4) Before the war, the Shanghai gold market was located in the "Shanghai Gold Exchange" on Jiujiang Road. After the "August 13th" Incident, the exchange was ordered to close. Now, what exists is a speculative kerb market, located in the ×× Bank on the fourth floor of No. 119 ×× Road. Its opening hours are the same as the foreign exchange market, but trading is limited to spot transactions, also known as "bars." The bars are 100% pure and come in two shapes: square bars and flat bars. Each bar is calculated as ten Shanghai taels of gold. The minimum trading unit is usually one bar, and settlement is on the same day. There are also those who trade futures, but it is extremely secretive. Customers can entrust speculative money houses and banks to handle buying and selling, and only need to pay a commission of 2 to 5 yuan per bar when buying and selling. Those without financial resources can also entrust speculative money houses and banks to buy and make margin loans, but in addition to paying a considerable commission, they must also pay a deposit, and when selling, they must also repay the interest on the purchase price. Therefore, the loss is very large. The margin is 500 to 1,000 yuan, and the monthly interest rate is 2% to 4%. However, the commissions, margins, and interest rates stipulated by each company are not uniform, and they are mostly determined by the relationship and creditworthiness of the client and the tightness of the money supply. Judging from this mode of operation and the rapid rise and fall of the market, even those who are good at speculation cannot avoid losses. It goes without saying for those who are not good at speculation. Especially if the method of borrowing money for buying and selling is used, the purpose of those engaged in this business is the client's margin and interest. It is common for the entire amount to be lost after the margin and interest are paid. How can those who are not good at this business and are not familiar with the inside story try it lightly?</p>
<p>Mr. Zhao Zhengxing asked: I have read your newspaper (Economic Supplement, Commercial News column, page 11 of the third sheet on February 19, 29th year of the Republic): "International Exchange Rates: 'British to Shanghai - Four Pence Four Three Seven Five.'" Is it the same for Hong Kong to Shanghai? According to this, how much Shanghai currency can be obtained for 1,000 Hong Kong banknotes? I would be grateful for a reply!</p>
<p>Wang Xiangqin answers:</p>
<p>The British exchange rate and the Hong Kong exchange rate are completely two different things. The former refers to the daily exchange rate of the British pound against legal tender; the latter refers to the daily exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar against legal tender. On February 19, the British-Shanghai exchange rate was four pence four three seven five for one yuan of legal tender, and the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate was 26 yuan and 75 cents for 100 yuan of legal tender. If calculated according to the exchange rate on that day, if 1,000 Hong Kong dollars are remitted from Hong Kong to Shanghai, then more than 3,730 yuan of legal tender can be obtained in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Securities: Overview of Foreign Stock Trading Last Week. The Jardine Matheson shares rose and fell sharply, with a difference of 45 yuan.</h3>
<p>Last week, the prices of stocks in various industry guilds fluctuated suddenly, rising and falling sharply, which was a major change not seen in the past year or two. Outsiders were shocked and told each other, some rejoicing that they were not involved, and others regretting that they had not taken action. The joys and sorrows of those involved can be imagined. The rise and fall of Jardine Matheson shares were the largest and fastest. The closing price on Friday the 19th was 227 yuan. After the weekend and Sunday holidays with no market, the market opened on Monday the 22nd and suddenly rose to 272 yuan. The difference between the high and low was as much as 45 yuan per share, which was unprecedented. According to the issue amount of the stock, 239,356 shares, the increase in value was more than 10.77 million yuan. It is absolutely unreasonable to say that its assets suddenly increased by such a huge amount in 48 hours, and who can believe it? On the 22nd, the total transaction volume in one day was 28,800 shares, that is, 272 yuan. The transaction at the highest price also accounted for more than 4,600 shares. The psychology of the buyers was definitely not to hope for the exclusive benefit of interest. Generally, people believed rumors and wanted to rise to 300 yuan to achieve their final victory. This was used by large speculators. The most difficult thing to grasp about the inside story is that brokers contracted with each other, used people's hearts, and used the advantage that the industry guild never charged commissions to brokers to achieve empty buying and empty selling. On the surface, there were transactions, but in fact, there was nothing behind them. They just kept raising the price until it was quite high, and then secretly came out and transferred the high-priced goods to the general blind followers. Their skills were sold, and the harm was so great. According to the market price on the 19th (that is, the day before the highest price), it was 127 yuan, and the total transaction volume was also 10,600 shares. At such a high price on the 22nd, the bulls had already made a profit. Even if they did not sell all of them, they must have sold a large part of them. Moreover, those who had previously bought at a small price on the 19th would inevitably want to prevent them from coming out. At this extremely high and dangerous time, they still wanted to buy in. What is it if not blind speculation?</p>
<p>The highest price of the stock last year was 76.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 28 yuan, with an average of more than 52 yuan, which has exceeded the face value by two or three times. In the past four months of this year, it suddenly rose to nearly 200 yuan higher than the highest price last year. Calculated in this way, the company's assets have increased by 47.89 million yuan this year. No matter how the various assets of the company are valued at the market price, it is impossible to rise so much in such a short period of time. Even the interest it pays has not been seen to be particularly higher than other stocks. This level is of course what speculators pay attention to, but if you buy stocks without checking their assets, business, and three basic conditions for sales, and just follow what others say, then there is absolutely no doubt that the disaster is big or small. This is the common sense that investors and speculators should have. The same is true for other varieties.</p>
<p>At present, the trend of stock speculation is becoming more and more intense. Each broker, the larger ones, is no less than a large-scale foreign firm, and the smaller ones only rent one or two rooms. Each has a radio transmitter, and the industry guild reports its market prices and transaction volumes at any time. In the industry guild, except for brokers, no one is allowed to enter and visit during opening hours. Therefore, the offices of each broker are mixed with men and women, like a gambling den.</p>
<p>The industry guild recently stipulated that the trading rules for delivery are that within five days from Monday to Friday each week, buying and selling can be offset each other with the same product and the same amount of goods, and the difference in price is calculated to avoid the labor of collecting and delivering. After this, delivery is required. Therefore, this five-day period of hesitation opens a convenient door for speculators. In other words, it is a five-day short-term futures, and those who know the brokers slightly do not need to pay a deposit in advance.</p>
<p>(There is no provision for a deposit in the industry guild.) Saturday is completely closed, and Monday and Tuesday are the delivery period, but both buyers and sellers must pay the money first on Monday before they can receive the goods or money on Monday.</p>
<p>Now, stock trading is expanding, and the danger is also increasing. Therefore, each broker stipulates that during this war period between Britain and Germany, all British stocks in the hands of Germans are at risk of being confiscated by Britain, so the goods must be transferred immediately after receiving them. Any disputes should be resolved as soon as possible, and they will not be responsible after ten days.</p>
<p>"Note" The broker's obligation to the industry guild is to pay a membership fee of 800 taels of silver once a year. No commission is charged at ordinary times. Therefore, the industry guild calls the brokers members. (The value of a membership position is now 1,500 pounds of British gold.) It is not easy to buy it. (9)</p>

<h3>Old News Newly Copied 67 Years Ago (369)</h3>
<p>(From this newspaper of the 12th year of the Tongzhi reign of the late Qing Dynasty)</p>
<p>Construction of Embankments</p>
<p>The villages and townships of Guangdong Province, which are surrounded by the sea on three sides, mostly rely on embankments to block the raging waves and secure their homes. The construction of embankments is financed by officials, or by the people themselves. The area where the waters of the East, South, and North Rivers converge is in Gulao Embankment, which is located in the important area of ​​the counties of Guangzhou and Zhaoqing. Outside the embankment is a vast expanse of water, and inside the embankment are rows of fields and houses. During the Daoguang period, it was breached twice. Thanks to the joint efforts of the gentry and elders of nearby villages, tens of thousands of dollars were spent on repairs, and the tranquility has been celebrated to this day. In recent years, the water has risen frequently, and the embankments have been damaged from time to time. The gentry and elders have witnessed the situation and are eager to prepare for a rainy day in order to be prepared. After gathering the crowd for public discussion, it is proposed to raise the low-lying embankments, thicken the thin ones, repair the tilted ones, and complete the damaged ones. This is indeed an essential task for disaster preparedness and a good plan for preventing disasters. Unexpectedly, there are two licentiates who, because they were not invited to sit at the meeting, interfered in various ways, which shocked everyone. In the past, Huang Sun of Lianzhou had great ambitions. He studied in Kuanglu and was friendly with Sang Weihan and Song Qiqiu. Every time they held hands, they discussed world affairs. The two always thought it was impossible. When they occasionally traveled together to the Five Old Peaks and rested on a stone, an old man arrived with a long whistle. The three spoke to him, and the old man looked at them for a long time and said to Weihan: "You will be prime minister in the future, but cunning will not allow you to die well." He said to Qiqiu: "You will also be prime minister, but forbearance will not allow you to die well." Only he said to Sun: "This man has Taoist spirit, and he should die well, but his talent is great and his position is obscure. He will only be engaged in one prefecture." Sun said: "Why worry about no position if you have talent? How can a subordinate official hinder Huang Sun?" The old man smiled and said: "You don't know it." Later, Weihan became prime minister of Jin, and Qiqiu became prime minister of the Southern Tang, and both were killed. Sun served in the Southern Han and was appointed as the Minister of the Left and Right of the Ministry of Personnel. When he retired, Sun spent his money to build the Gaoliang Embankment, irrigating more than 100 hectares of land, which the villagers relied on. Now people live at home and cannot benefit their villages and clans, how can they hope to benefit the people's livelihood when they are officials?</p>

<h3>The Clothing and Food of Laborers</h3>
<p>— Qiulang</p>
<p>Time flies like running water. The International Labor Day (May 1st) is coming again. Due to environmental reasons, the labor community in this city does not intend to hold a ceremony, but will take a day off on that day to show solidarity with the world's laborers and to celebrate. Laborers, in a broad sense, refer to all those who work hard from sunrise to sunset, whether mentally or physically. However, in a narrow sense, it seems to specifically refer to ordinary working-class laborers, who make a living with their strength and skills all day long. Although there is a reputation of "Laborer is Sacred" in society, observing a portion of Chinese laborers, it is indeed very miserable! They work hard every morning, perhaps day and night, but it is still difficult to get enough to eat. This is due to the poor social system, and there is indeed a need for improvement! Let me now talk about the clothing and food of laborers.</p>
<p>The workers who work in factories are naturally better off than the hard laborers who work on the streets, because they have specialized skills in electricity or machinery. When they work in the factory, they wear specially made factory uniforms. These factory uniforms are made of coarse cloth, and the color is mostly dark blue, which is durable and resistant to dirt. However, working in an environment with coal ash and machine oil still inevitably leaves oil stains all over the body. But when they leave the factory after work, they change into neat clothes, like handsome young men. As for the hard laborers on the streets, such as dock porters, loaders, road workers, and rickshaw pullers; they only have a tattered, shabby short shirt and trousers, and there is no time to change into fancy clothes. Their spirit of enduring hardship is admirable.</p>
<p>As for the food of laborers, factory workers are also better off. They have three meals a day. In the morning, they casually eat some snacks or rice porridge and then go to the factory to work. At lunchtime, some live close enough to go home for lunch. Friends who live far away eat economy meals at nearby restaurants. There is also a group of female workers who eat packed meals in the factory. Among them, economical female workers bring some rice and vegetables with them when they enter the factory in the morning to fill their lunch. When it comes to working overtime at night, both male and female workers naturally go home for dinner. Only the hard laborers and rickshaw pullers on the streets, although they still work hard every day, do not have a fixed time to eat. Sometimes they eat early, sometimes late. If they encounter times when there is not enough money in their pockets, they randomly buy a few pancakes, fried dough sticks, or noodles to fill their stomachs. They work hard and the enjoyment they get is so meager that we should sympathize with them. We sincerely hope that those who care about society can find ways to improve their lives, so that they will not lack clothing and food, and so that we will not fail to commemorate the significance of Labor Day.</p>
<h3>Western Suit Protection Methods</h3>
<p>— Xiao Qi</p>
<p>Recently, the number of people wearing Western suits has increased day by day, but many do not know how to store and maintain them, causing them to quickly become old and worn, losing their aesthetic appeal. Now, I will introduce the protection methods as follows:</p>
<p>Our daily-worn Western suits inevitably accumulate a lot of dust. Over time, this causes them to lose their original beauty. Therefore, each time after returning from outside, you must brush off the dust from the clothes with a clothes brush. Whether it's a jacket or pants, the brushing method must be consistent: first, brush from bottom to top to lift the fibers, and then brush from top to bottom to smooth the fibers and restore their original state. When brushing, use light force to avoid damaging the material, as Western suits are mostly made of woolen fabrics. Even when they are not made of woolen fabrics, this brushing method should be used; otherwise, you will not only fail to brush away the accumulated dust but also easily damage the suit. In addition, clothes that are usually stored at home and not worn should also be taken out frequently and brushed clean. If you find stains or grease spots on the clothes, you must remove them immediately. For fresh wine spills, you can wrap the stained area with a damp towel and rub it, which should remove the stain immediately. If it has been there for some time, you can rub it with a solution made from burning rice straw ash, then wipe it with water and carefully brush it off to eliminate the stain.</p>
<p>If the stain is from fruit juice, you can rub it with ordinary soap, then lightly wash it with water to remove it. For sweat stains on collars and cuffs, you can wipe them with volatile oil at any time to eliminate them. Pants cuffs are most easily soiled with mud. Do not wipe them when wet; wait until they are dry and then wipe them off with gauze.</p>
<p>Because the creases of Western suit pants must be neat, it is sometimes necessary to iron them frequently. However, excessive ironing can damage the fabric, so it is best to fold the Western suit pants neatly every night before going to bed, lay them on a flat table, and weigh them down with heavy objects. This will prevent the creases of the pants from losing their shape.</p>
<p>Western suit jackets can be hung up with a clothes hanger every night. For materials like serge, do not iron them directly; you must隔 put a wet towel in between, otherwise, they will be ironed into a shiny, mirrored surface. Also, for frequently changed clothes such as undershirts, you must remove all the dirt from the pockets before washing them. After washing and drying, make sure they are completely dry before putting them away, and they should be ironed before wearing. If you are casual about it, the result will be an unattractive Western suit.</p>
<h3>Mobile Homes</h3>
<p>— Ni Xin</p>
<p>In the world, no people are better at enjoying life than Americans. The American standard of living is the highest, and yet the American lifestyle is also the most comfortable. The lives of people in American cities are the most intense, but they also have the most ways to seek enjoyment outside of work. What seems difficult to achieve, they can find ways to achieve. As the earth returns to spring, people become weary of city life. What they yearn for most is not eating well or dressing well, but rather to isolate themselves from the hustle and bustle of the city, to rush to the tranquil countryside, where they can loosen their ties, stretch, breathe in some fresh air, embrace all of nature, and revel in the embrace of spring. For urban dwellers in other countries, these things seem to be merely sweet dreams, but Americans have made these dreams a reality. Their method is to utilize the mobile homes that have recently become popular in America.</p>
<p>A mobile home is a dwelling made of aluminum or steel, constructed half like a house and half like a carriage, with wheels underneath. It is connected to a car with a mechanism, so that the dwelling can be driven away at will.</p>
<p>These mobile homes are designed and manufactured by experts to cater to the outdoor living needs of city dwellers. They occupy a very economical space. From the outside, they may seem small in volume, but the interior area is quite spacious, comparable to a bus. Inside, there is a kitchen, a bedroom, and a recreation room. Although simple, it has all the necessary equipment.</p>
<p>Driving a mobile home from the city to the countryside and stopping at a suitable location allows one to comfortably enjoy the pleasures of rural life. In the past, urban dwellers would also come to the countryside for picnics and camping, but in terms of convenience and comfort, that is far from comparable to today's mobile homes!</p>

<h3>Small Notes on Food and Nourishment: Peanuts</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yaoren</p>
<p>Peanuts are leguminous plants, commonly known as "longevity fruits." They are about a foot tall, mostly creeping on the ground. The leaves are pinnate, with even leaflets. The flowers are yellow, shaped like small butterflies. After flowering, the ovary enters the ground one or two inches and forms a pod, containing one to four seeds. They are crisp and sweet, and are roasted as a leisure snack. In the early years of the Kangxi reign, Yi Yingyuan went to Japan to obtain seeds and sent them back to China, which is how this crop began to exist. Those produced in Xinghua are sweet and full, called "yellow soil"; those produced in Taiwan are astringent and small, called "white soil." This is because their soil properties are different; hence, the quality of their produce also varies greatly. It is said that their tips can produce phlegm, so they must be removed when eating them. I believe that their tips are where the crystallization occurs, so the reason for removing them is because they are difficult to digest, not because they cause phlegm. Furthermore, Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica does not include them, indicating that they were not used for medicinal purposes in ancient times. However, they can benefit the spleen, moisten the lungs, harmonize the stomach, and resolve phlegm, truly possessing nourishing power. It is a pity that physicians generally regard them as snacks and believe that they can produce phlegm and do not adopt them for medicinal purposes. I have often seen neighbors suffering from coughs with excessive phlegm, and I would take dozens of raw peanuts, remove the shells and skins, take the pure meat, mash it, and mix it with hot water to drink, and the phlegm and cough would subside on their own. In the past, the family of Tong Luan of Lu'an also used this method whenever they encountered phlegm and cough, and they said that its phlegm-resolving effect was better than that of Trichosanthes fruit and Fritillaria bulb. Common people eat them roasted with fire, which can produce phlegm, but I have tried it myself, eating eight or nine roasted peanuts and feeling that phlegm accumulates and is easier to expectorate. Therefore, the phlegm-resolving and phlegm-clearing effects depend entirely on whether they are raw or cooked, but it is best to eat them in small amounts.</p>
<p>Small Notes on Food and Nourishment was commissioned by my teacher, Mr. Xuyuan. This article was not revised and edited before he suddenly passed away. The bad news arrived, and my heart was deeply saddened. Therefore, I filled out a ci poem "Partridge Sky" and added it at the end, truly not knowing that my tears would fill the stationery.</p>
<p>The bad news suddenly came this morning,</p>
<p>I felt黯然 and wanted to die.</p>
<p>I was afraid to mention the past and put down the pen,</p>
<p>How could I bear to read the old articles on food nourishment?</p>
<p>I thought of his俊逸,</p>
<p>His句淸新,</p>
<p>I threw my heart into it and became a poet.</p>

<h3>Please Teachers and Parents Read This Report from the "Little Thieves Gang"</h3>
<p>— Qing Xian</p>
<p>This is unfortunate news. The author discovered a "Little Thieves Gang" theft case yesterday afternoon. Now, I will briefly record the entire process below and hope that all parents and teachers will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday afternoon, I received a report from a peddler of used goods saying that a group of children had stolen towels and other items from your store and wanted to sell them to a used goods dealer. Because he suspected that the source was illegal, he did not buy them and came specifically to inform us. After receiving this warning, the colleagues in our store took special precautions, especially paying attention to the children who often entered and exited the store, thus leading to the arrest yesterday.</p>
<p>First, there were about eight or nine children playing outside the store. Eventually, two of them entered the store to carry out the "work" of theft, leading to their arrest.</p>
<p>"Did you steal our merchandise?" I began to question him like this.</p>
<p>"Sir! I didn't steal!"</p>
<p>I firmly grabbed his small hands and pulled out the three stolen handkerchiefs from his pocket. I asked him again, "What are these? Do you admit that you stole them?"</p>
<p>"Sir! I won't do it again!" he pleaded.</p>
<p>"Okay, I can forgive you. But were you the one who stole the towels twice the day before yesterday?"</p>
<p>"No, no, it wasn't me." At this time, another staff member caught a so-called "lookout," who was about eleven or twelve years old, as thin as a monkey. I asked him sharply, "How old are you? What's your name?" But I asked three times, and he didn't answer. Then I said in a threatening tone, "If you don't tell me, we'll beat you to death!" I waved my hand at him.</p>
<p>The older one still didn't say a word. The younger one seemed frightened and slowly said, "I'm eleven years old this year, and my name is Tian ××. My senior brother (referring to the older one) is fourteen years old, his surname is Wang. We both study at the Hedde Road ×× Elementary School."</p>
<p>"Why did you steal?"</p>
<p>"One evening after school, as I walked out of the school gate, a man in a Western suit grabbed my sleeve and said with a smile, 'Good brother! How about I give you five cents?'"</p>
<p>"Why are you giving me money? I don't want it."</p>
<p>"'I'll not only give you money but also treat you to a movie and snacks.'"</p>
<p>"'I can't accept it.'"</p>
<p>"'Good brother! Are you Tian ××? Your father told me to accompany you to the movies and have snacks.'"</p>
<p>"'Sir! Really? Thank you, I'll go with you.'"</p>
<p>"'After watching the movie, when we were eating snacks, he asked me to do one thing—to steal. I said in surprise, 'My mother doesn't allow me to, and I don't want to steal other people's things. People who steal are thieves!'"</p>
<p>"'Was the movie good? Did the snacks taste good? Was the sugar bought with money sweet? If you don't steal, as long as you keep an eye on your senior brother Wang ×× to see if anyone is going to catch him, then you can get food, entertainment, and money every day.' The man in the Western suit said to me, then greeted two people who were already sitting at the opposite table and introduced them to me."</p>
<p>"'That is Captain Wu. You must listen to his commands. That is Brother Wang (a classmate), your senior brother. You watch him to see if anyone is going to catch him.'"</p>
<p>"After I joined their gang, I learned that there were a total of twenty-seven members, divided into three small teams, each with a captain. After school, the twenty-seven people would gather at a predetermined place, listen to the man in the Western suit assign them to steal things in various places, and be directed by the captain. At 4:30 in the evening, everyone would return to the predetermined delivery place (different every day) to hand over the goods. Depending on each person's work strength, they could receive a reward of five cents to one dime. When dismissing, the man in the Western suit would determine the next day's gathering place and delivery place after school. If you didn't have anything to hand over, you would be whipped. If you had already joined the gang (seeing the movie was considered joining the gang) and didn't go to work, or wanted to quit, you would be severely beaten."</p>
<p>"Therefore, although I regretted it, I couldn't escape. Today, Senior Brother Wang is the thief, and I am the 'lookout.' Captain Wu has already gone back to report to the man in the Western suit."</p>
<p>After listening to his words, I couldn't help but feel frightened. This is such a significant issue! The hearts of children are pure, but their willpower is weak. That man in the Western suit uses coercive and enticing, terrorizing methods to lead the young citizens of China onto the path of bandits. This crime is unforgivable. However, if teachers and parents can pay attention to the actions of their children after school, this terrible thing would not happen.</p>
<p>Dear parents and teachers! Quickly and strictly monitor your children!</p>
<p>Editor's note: This is a report written by a staff member of a store in the 百樂商塲 describing the results of personally interrogating the "Little Thieves Gang." The two children have been sent to the Jing'an Temple police station. This kind of organization, which is even more abhorrent than kidnappers, should be thoroughly investigated with the assistance of schools and parents.</p>
<h3>A Righteous Person Who Meddles in Others' Affairs</h3>
<p>— Kang</p>
<p>At around 8:00 this morning, at the intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Xinzha Road, a truck ran over a young man riding a bicycle, throwing him six or seven feet. His lower body was injured. The truck driver not only did not help the injured person up but also punched him repeatedly. The truck's worker also joined in the beating, causing the injured person to suffer additional injuries. At that time, although the passersby were all indignant, none of them stood up to speak out. Fortunately, a British conductor on a public bus (number forgotten) stepped forward to speak out righteously and called the police, sending everyone to the police station for investigation. I happened to be passing by and learned about this after questioning passersby. Only then did the other passersby start to discuss it, some saying, "This conductor spoke out righteously and stood up for the victim, which is truly admirable!" Others said, "Why make enemies? It's better to mind your own business. Meddling only creates more trouble!" Still others said, "If I were the driver, I would first teach this conductor a lesson." Upon hearing this, I couldn't help but feel moved. The truck driver was at fault for injuring someone and should not have resorted to violence. He should be severely punished as a warning to others. This conductor was able to stand up for what is right, which is a model for us all. It also shows that justice still exists. Therefore, I am recording this incident and expressing my deep gratitude to the righteous conductor on behalf of the injured person.</p>
<p>"Meddling in others' affairs" is not necessarily a bad thing, and sometimes we need righteous people who "meddle in others' affairs."</p>
<h3>Free Clinic</h3>
<p>— Ji Pai</p>
<p>Previously, this publication introduced two hospitals that provide free treatment specifically for the poor and sick: one is the American Refugee Hospital at 37 Bailinan Road, opposite the Zhaofeng Garden, and the other is the Tongsheng Hospital near Luban Road on Wangzhi Road. These are indeed a boon for the poor and sick.</p>
<p>Today, I would also like to introduce a traditional Chinese medicine doctor who provides "free clinics": Mr. Cao Nianxiu.</p>
<p>Mr. Cao's clinic is located at 17 Zhonghe Lane, Pike Road, Avenue Edward VII. He stipulates that 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM every day is the time for free clinics. During this time, no consultation fee will be charged, and those in extreme poverty will also receive some help with medication costs.</p>
<p>This is indeed a very powerful form of relief for the general poor and sick. I hope that all doctors in Shanghai will follow Mr. Cao's example and set aside two hours each day to fulfill humanity's duty to help the poor and sick.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 23: Old Friends and New Companions, Articles Have Value; Famous Scenic Spots and Tourist Destinations, Leaders Gain Respect</p>
<p>This meal lasted for more than nine hours. After nine o'clock, it was the editors' working time, so I did not bother them any further. The ladies also went their separate ways. As they parted, Jin Danyu arranged for them to try the first family touring car tomorrow. She invited the sisters to her house to set off together. Wu Junsu said, "I can't go. I've already taken a day off today, and I can't take another one tomorrow." Jin Danyu asked, "What time do you have class tomorrow?" Wu Junsu said, "I only have class in the afternoon tomorrow." Jin Danyu said, "That's great. We'll use this touring car to take you to Soochow University in the morning. After dropping you off at school, we'll go sightseeing. For the second test drive, we'll pick a Saturday or Sunday to invite you to join us." Wu Junsu said, "What's the point of that? Won't it take up more time to send me back to school? And where are you planning to travel to? I'm afraid the roads won't be convenient." Jin Danyu laughed and said, "Because the roads are good, that's why I said that. These days, the autumn sky is high and clear, and the scenery is clear and bright. It's that time when the weather is already cool but not yet cold. The crabs are fat and the rice is ripe everywhere in Jiangnan. After the construction of the Li Lake Road along Tai Lake, we've only walked it intermittently a few times. It's said that there are several places with extremely beautiful scenery, with vast expanses of misty waves and fishing boats swaying. Mrs. Su Yali also wants to take this opportunity to travel, so we're going to Suzhou anyway, so we can conveniently take you to school." Wu Junsu said, "I see." Shao Huihua said, "Sister Junsu, how free you are as a university teacher. Now that we're all going sightseeing, you're missing out. I advise you to resign from your university teaching position next year and come to our newspaper office to be an editor." At the appointed time the next day, everyone gathered at Jin Danyu's house. Jin Danyu said that this time it could be considered a honeymoon trip, but a public honeymoon trip. Besides their new couple, there was also Mrs. Su Yali, as well as many of Jin Danyu's small preparations, all of which were new. Although China has manufactured many family touring cars, each time they are gradually improved. The improvement of these cars cannot rely solely on the cars themselves, because it is related to their raw materials and environment. For example, to build a car, there are wood, metal objects, paint, rubber wheels, etc., and China's rubber manufacturing industry is also gradually developing. In addition, there are roads. If the roads are not well-maintained, the car will also be easily damaged. So if we talk about the year, that car would be the Chinese 1951 model. (269)</p>
<h3>Faithful in Small Things "Whoever is faithful in small matters will also be faithful in great matters" (1)</h3>
<p>God Himself has set an example for us to be faithful in small matters. Take the honeycomb, for example. The structure of the honeycomb is originally one of the most difficult and precise problems. One hundred and fifty years ago, famous British mathematicians and physicists discussed this problem, and they all agreed that the structure of the honeycomb is best suited to mathematical principles. God has created such a small honeycomb with such care, which is enough to prove His faithfulness in small matters. We also see that the Lord Jesus also did not despise small matters. For example, after He fed fifty people with five loaves of bread and two fish, He did not ask her, Jesus thought of the lack of patients, and told people to give them something to eat. The above few things are all positive proofs of Jesus's faithfulness in small matters. We must know that doing a small good deed or doing a small bad deed has a very important impact on our lives. A certain five decided to build a very grand church to glorify God. When the church was built, he invited many people to attend the dedication ceremony. He walked to the corner of the church wall and saw that the name engraved on the cornerstone was that of a poor widow. So he ordered people to stop the dedication ceremony and ordered people to bring the poor widow to ask her, "What have you done? Your name is engraved on the cornerstone?" The woman said that she originally wanted to contribute to the construction of the church, but she was too poor to take out money. So she often went to the fields to cut grass for the horses pulling carts to eat to fulfill her wish. Wang heard this and said, let her name be engraved on the stone, she did more than I did!

<h3>French General's Opinion on Quinine</h3>
<p>— M.Hhin.182</p>
<p>During the World War in 1916. From July to December, General Sarrail, who was then the Minister of War, said: "Our army has been disbanded in the hospital!"</p>
<p>After this malaria epidemic, the French government sent malaria research experts, the Sanchaud brothers, to work to prevent the French army from being completely destroyed by mosquitoes. As a result, it was stipulated that quinine should be used to radically cure various steps of malaria, and severe punishment was imposed on those who attempted to evade treatment. Rules and regulations were formulated and strictly enforced, so that this malaria eradication movement was able to achieve good results.</p>
<p>When General 條塞 spoke to military doctors, he mentioned the spread of malaria and the method of using quinine for treatment, please: "When engaged in the work of eradicating epidemics, the biggest enemy that is most difficult to overcome is "negligence." The regulations regarding taking quinine are like military orders, and everyone must follow them strictly, without allowing any deception or cultivation." General 佛塞 knew very well where the great enemy was, but at that time, there were no precise regulations on the use of quinine. In recent years, the League of Nations Malaria Commission has conducted long-term research and stipulated that the total amount of quinine is fifteen to twenty grains, taken continuously for five to seven days. The 124th page of the 1938 report of the Malaria Commission specifically pointed out that quinine is safe and harmless and can be used by ordinary people without the need for a doctor to supervise its use, while comprehensive drugs must be used under the supervision of a doctor.</p>
<p>The reason why the French troops stationed in Macedonia were not completely destroyed by malaria should be attributed to the foresight of their commanders, General Sarrail and General 佛塞. They believed that using quinine as a treatment for malaria for the army was not only a responsibility but also a necessity.</p>
