<h3>國父誕辰　林主席演辭</h3>
<p>重慶　國父誕辰紀念、林主席在中樞紀念會報吿一紀念國父誕辰的意義」、略謂諸位、今天是本黨總理中華民國　父孫中山先生的誕辰、我們在中日戰爭進到第四年的今天、來開會紀念創造中華民國國父的誕辰、特別覺得有偉大深切的意義、</p>
<p>第一、我們要加深認識國父領導革命的精神、國父生當滿淸專制時代、那時候政治腐敗達於極點、國內承滿淸專制壓迫太平天國革命戰爭之後、以致國力消耗、人民困苦、吏治又腐敗到極點、冉也不能振作起來、外面受到列强層出不窮的侵略、訂了許多喪權辱國的條的、把國家陷到次殖民地的地位、國父看到這情形、覺得冉不起來發動革命、推翻專制、創建共和、國家是沒有改造希望、所以從幼年讀書起、就立定志願、一心研究古今中外關於治國平天下的道理、終於創造出劃時代的三民主義、五權憲法、抱定大　畏精神、大聲疾呼、奔走海內外、先後組織興中會、同盟會、最後組織中國國民黨、號召同志、喚起全國同胞、一致起來、共同奮鬥、國父立定革命志願、創造革命主義、他本人不但是坐而言、並且是起而行、行了失敗、不但不灰心、不沮喪、並且愈是失敗、愈是奮鬥、無論環境怎樣困難、總是百折不撓、再接再厲、領導同志、奮勇回前、這種崇高偉大的革命領導精神、應該值得我們　愛、這是我們今天紀念國父誕辰應當提起大家注意的第一點、</p>
<p>第二、國父倡導國民革命、其目的在求中國之獨立自由平等、道獨立自由平等的解釋，就是對內求目存、對外求共存、假使我們一天沒有達到這個目的、就一天不能停止我們對革命的努力、我們承認日本是東亞的强國、地理上也和我們中國最接近、應該對於我們所抱的革命目的、認識最淸楚、要進步來幫助我們、可是事實上適得其反、日本始終不願有一個獨立自由富强的中國、與他共存共榮、他不但不幫助我們革命、反而陰謀破壞我們革命、甚至直接用武力打擊我們革命、這種事實、多到不可勝計、諸位想必知道淸楚、今天也不必再說、可是我們革命行動、難道因日本的妒忌破壞打擊、便就終止了麼、凡是每一個眞正黃帝的子孫、國父的信徒、決不能忍耐這種恥辱的、日本自從製造「九一八」以及「七七」事變以來、他一貫的武力侵華野心、已經暴露無餘、我們如果不起來自衛、那末國父昭示我們的國民革命目的、便永遠沒有實現的希望、這是我們今天紀念國父誕辰應當提起大家注意的第二點、</p>
<p>第三、我們要　護國策、爭取最後勝利、是我們今日至高無上的國策、自從前年本黨臨時全國代表大會、決定了這個　策之後、全國人民、早已一致認識、一致擁護的了、不料後來　有少數人、自已失去了對革命的立塲、還要誤解國父所主張的大亞細亞中義和平奮鬥救中國的話、牽强附會、當作護符、他們不知道國父所主張的大亞細亞主義、是平面的、不是立體的、凡是亞洲各國、一律平等相待、互相尊重、決不是仰人鼻息、甘做附庸的卑劣思想可比、至於和平奮鬥救中國、乃是和平不忘奮鬥的意思、也只有在奮鬥中求到的和平、纔是獨立自由平等的和平、他們忘却奮鬥、只求和平、道種自己不用力量得來的和平、一定是屈服的和平、奴隸的和平、那裏是眞正的和平、現在日本因爲武力侵華、打了三年多、戰事絲毫沒有辦法、便異想天開、假造種種和平謠言、來動搖我們人心、那裹知道我們國策早經決定、日人的造謠手段、沒有不被我們鐵般的事實擊破的、道是我們今天紀念國父誕辰應當提起大家注意的第三點、</p>
<p>總之、本黨總理是創造中華民國的國父、有總理然後有本黨有本黨然後有國民革命、有國民革命然後有奮鬥爭存的中華民國產生、有奮鬥爭存的中華民國、然後有對日侵略長期戰爭今日欣逢國父誕辰、適富中日進入第四年勝利逐漸接近的時候、日人的力量、已經消耗得一天减少一天了、我們只要本着國父昭示我們的革命精神、鼓起勇氣來振奮前進、獲爭取最後勝利、（十二日電）</p>

<h3>日本對美外的新姿態</h3>
<p>適在莫洛托夫聘德的同時，日本的對美外交亦開始了新的積極運用；開始在本月十日日外相松岡與美大使格魯舉行二小時的會談。內容據說是檢討美日關係的細則旋即有野村大將繼崛內使美的任命，同時並傳聞日方將由松岡外相率領使節團蒞美作親善的訪問，雖然此一傳說實現的可能極爲微小，但實足顯出日方亟謀改善美日關係的用心。以三國同盟而略見澄淸的國際局勢，連日已因蘇德間新形態的存在而重陷迷離，日方對美外交之此一萌動、無疑更在其間增加了疑雲暗霧與錯綜繁複。</p>
<p>據昨日未經證實的傳言：蘇日不侵協定的談判，似已更趨接近，無論蘇聯如何不改變其對於遠東及援助中國的立塲，蘇德間的接近，必不免無形減輕了蘇日間的隔膜。日本之親近蘇聯，用意無非爲便於南進並與英美相敵對，據常理來推測，目前似乎正是日本對美轉趨强硬的時機；試檢羅斯福三度膺選後的日方輿論，亦幾乎衆口一詞的認爲美日接近的途徑已歸堵塞。乃日當局最近的外交運用，不只出乎世人常識意料之外，亦且與日本一般見解大相逕庭，此中消息，到是值得嚴重予以注意的。</p>
<p>在各方事實尚未十分判明之前，不妨姑就不同角度予以透視；第一，三國盟的之簽訂，原本違反日本最大部分的輿情，如其眞能收穫嚇退英美加强自身地位的效果，則輿情上的反感未始不能逐漸消釋於無形。乃月餘以來，却徒然招致英美壓力，益形日本權利義務之不能相抵，而德義軍事政治情勢亦復每况愈下，進退支絀。則本來意在自利的日本自不能不別尋蹊徑藉謀出路。此種意態，在美國對日强硬態度甫形流露之際已在萌芽，及今乃進而見諸實際措施。第二，日本的南進，固已成如箭在弦之勢，而以今日南亞政情之繁複，軍備之孱弱，以及聯防制度之缺乏，經濟攫奪與不戰而勝的途徑並未全被杜絕，但却一定要利用英美注意力的鬆弛及其對日關係尚不到十分僵化，有如前此之於越北。爲了這一企圖，日本實有對英美—允其對美—續謀和緩及愚弄的必要。第三，目前歐戰情勢適在急劇發展的前夜，其對於日本之爲利害得失，目前尚難驟即斷定，是以日方尚有稍事觀望以俟有利時機到來的必要，因之也就不能不對有加無已的美方重壓暫求其輕減。第四，蘇德的接近，雖足以推進蘇日談判的進行，而另一方面，又必然促成英美與蘇聯關係的惡化，並引起英美上層份子間反蘇情緒的復活，這確又是日本可能緩和英美關係的另一機會，日方自　免幻想利用此一機遇俾於其間坐收左右逢源之效。第五，爲了經濟的理由，在日本所誚東亞經濟集團計劃尚未獲收實效之前，實無法完全擺脫對英美的依賴；其對外貿易的停滯，國際收支的惡化，各種資源的恐慌，通貨膨脹的激進，都逼迫日富局不能不暫求對美關係的轉圜以解救其經濟上的危殆。第六，日本對於西方列強的應付、一向以分化英美爲主要策略，目前欲與英美雙方爲敵旣爲日本實力所不許，不得已而求其决，如能減輕美國反感，則英國應付歐局之不暇，當不致形成日方的大患。無、　日方最近對美種種外交姿態的主要動機究竟何在，要當不出上述各種推測而外。是以這並非松岡自身的反汗，自食取消媚態外交的前言，而是爲當前種種實際困難所限，不能不採取迂迴途徑以爲應付，在這和緩外衣的裏面，却依然是從前的一副面目。這也並不是日本急進主義的失敗，因爲此其用意，最後正是爲了利於急進主張的遂仃。雖然近衛與軍部之間已存有相當裂痕，松岡的外交見解也不盡與白鳥敏夫之流相符合，但在目前日本政治情勢之下，絕對無法想像其已有窮途知返或根本悔禍的可能。</p>
<p>然而這種運用，充其量不過是已經宇垣阿部失敗舊調的重演，在一年或二年以前，且小足以獲致實效，當更無論於今日。日方的此種姿態，主要還是針對着目前混沌的國際局勢及其自身準備未屆完成的弱點。說不定也許會迅即有所更張。歐局前途，誠足使人懸慮。然而預料當穌聯不致大事改變其中立立塲而爲過分的左右袒，且太平洋問題，適如本報昨日社論所指出，並非蘇德所能把握得住；且日本目前的種種運用。完全都只爲自身打算，就三國盟的義務言，顯亦非德義所樂聞。至於另一方面，美國的遠東政策與中國的堅定抗戰，絕不致因國際間的繁複動向與日片面願望而撼動分毫，這是可以斷言的。</p>

<h3>歌戰痛史（三）　法國悲劇中三主角　（一）外強中幹的達拉第</h3>
<p>法國第一流作家裘羅曼Jules　Romains，文名藉甚，所交多達官貴人。他曾在此决歐戰爆發前，奉當道之命，遊說各國，作外交上之秘密活動，意欲弭戰於未形。惜其所謀不遂，空手而歸，目覩祖國淪亡，天下板蕩，遠走美國，不勝麥秀黍油之感。爰以過去歷訪歐洲各國執政首要之經過，筆而出之，人各一相，多爲局外人所萬想不到者。其蒐羅之豐富，文筆之曲折，誠近代史中不可多得之重要掌故也。關於法國部份奢，有前總理達拉第，及聯軍總司令甘茂林將軍兩人個性之解剖，讀之令人哭笑不得：茲分別迻譯如左：</p>
<p>裘雜曼與達拉第之相識，遠在一九二六年春。那時候裘羅曼所著的一獨裁者劇本，在法蘭西話劇院預演，曾博得參觀者的好評。達拉第也就是其中的一人，且極力担保這劇本公演時，如有反響，他一人願意出來担當一切責任。其時法國正當「承平之世，」上下佚樂，原不算什麼一回事。法政府中幾個執政大老，和國會議員，很多捧女優及和姑娘們發生瞹昧情事的。達拉第其時任敎育部長之職，在他召見裘羅曼談話的一天，談論到這種桃色事件時，達拉第邊笑邊說道：「老實說，我從未與話劇院裏的年靑姑娘們發生過勾搭，以敎育部長的地位而論，當亦可吿無愧了罷。」</p>
<p>裘羅曼對於達拉第的印象，可於下面幾句話中看出來：「別後，我想這眞是我們所需要的一位人物了。不久，我又想，也許他就是我們所希望中的一個人，我們所萬萬少不來的一個人。我總要密切注視着他纔是呢。」</p>
<p>幾個月之後，達拉第當選爲急進社會黨總裁之職。嗣後數年中，屢仟顯要，大權在握，各方面對他企望甚深。那裏知道一九三四年二月六日，巴黎發生暴動後，他竟經不起一些小小風波，於翌日就使內閣解體。當天晚上巴黎市中大起騷動，車輛被阻，商舖遭刦，警察們視若無覩。工人們滿面怒容，大喊「處元兇達拉第以極刑。」達拉第優柔寡斷的種種缺點，至此暴露無遺了。</p>
<p>兩年之後，卽一九三六年五月，人民陣綫內閣成立，達拉第亦被選爲其中領袖之一，雖某地位不見十分重要，但是嗣後已漸漸恢復了他已失去的權力。這時期中，國社黨助統治的德國和法西斯黨所統治的義大利，漸漸拉攏，歐洲的局面一天一天黑暗起來。達拉第就於此時出任陸軍部長之職。這對於達拉第却是予以另一個作爲的機會。各方面都希望他能按步就班的做去。整軍經武，把軍隊好好的訓練起來，第一不要被軍閥們所利用。大家都相信這一决他一定能大展宏圖，不　蹈二月六日的覆轍了</p>
<p>裘羅曼筆下所傳的達拉第的神秘色彩，現在呈顯在我們的目前了。他說：</p>
<p>一九三八年四月，達拉第任內閣總理兼陸軍部長之職。龐納繼台爾博斯任外交部長。我（作者自稱，下仿此）和龐納常常來往，好像以前和台爾博斯一樣，也無非是同樣想在尋求和平的途徑之中，不使戰事有爆發的機會。就在那時，我漫遊歐洲，歷訪十四國，其動機在和歐洲各國重要人物，如政治家，名公巨卿，及社會領袖等，秘密作詳細的商談，想把幾個自由國家或局部未受壓迫的國家，聯合起來，共同維持歐洲和平。</p>
<p>我和龐納談話時，常問起他道，「你也把我的行動吿訴達拉第的麼？他的意見怎樣呢？」那時國人對於龐納頗多不髖解之處，我則總覺得他是值得贊譽的。我和他的談話並非泛浮無的，而且一談之後，定有結果。就大體上講，我雖沒有慫恿他把我們所講的話去吿訴達拉第，但是我確切知道，龐納隨時把我所談的吿知他哩</p>
<p>是年十一月初某一天，龐納滿面愁容，跑來對我道「總理心緒異常惡劣。」此時恰當慕尼克會議後一個月光景。當達拉第纔從慕尼克返國之時，他覺得他已盡了最大的努力，但是心中總覺惴惴不安。他以爲返回巴黎時，難免不受市民們的奚落，可是事出意外，他們竟予以非常熱烈的歡迎。不久，大家的意見父轉變了，很疑心達拉第在慕尼克難免沒有全盤出賣的不可吿人之舉。及至希特勒在薩爾勃魯根發表演說，大家頂上眞像澆了一勺水。陰謀家虎視耽耽，乘機而動。共產黨人接到莫斯科的命令，向達拉第及龐納領導的內閣搗亂，以爲慕尼克失敗的懲罰。他們一開手就做得很巧妙而惡毒，在工人階級中煽動是非。（直至一年之後，戰事爆發，工人中間還是紛擾未已。）</p>
<p>龐納接着說：「是呀達拉第心中頗爲了了。他覺得四面有人要不利於他，但不知他在中樞各要人中，實具有舉足輕重的地位。祇要他能稍自振作，可把陰謀家一揚而空，使共黨份子銷聲匿跡。可惜他有些像扶不起的阿斗，要是他再一倒，全部就要付諸東流了。」</p>
<p>其時法國人對於他一九三四年二月七日的顚覆，早已忘懷，大家現在又寄着莫大的希望於他身上，以爲在法蘭西危急存亡之秋，他將爲一位眞正政治史上的英雄，至少限度，時勢造英雄，非此公莫屬。</p>
<p>要是達拉第此時不安於位，政治舞台上勢將發生紛擾，街市和工廠間也將出於混亂，禍兆一萌，不到幾星期，外惠便將接踵而至哩。</p>
<p>龐納對我道：「請聽，足下務須走訪達拉第，與之作一長談。我們爲支撑他而對他所講的話，目下見效甚微。惟有仰仗大力，進以奮勉之詞，使他心神方面獲得　定。務望迅速前去。」</p>
<p>我考慮者再，叉記起一月六日晚，寄一小柬於他之事，（一九三四年二月六日巴黎發生暴動，當晚作者曾繕一便條與達拉第，囑其堅持到底，勿遽屈服。但結果，適得其反，達拉第終竟以倒閣出走了事）不禁好笑起來，但我還是答覆龐納說：「好罷，試試本來無妨，但是一談之後是吾有效，我不敢擔保；老兄還須從旁贊助爲要。眼前我且來寫一封情詞懇切的信給他，往訪之事，留待寫信之後再說。我希望此信一去，立見分曉，再經一談，事情當無有不諧的了。」</p>
<p>龐納道：「此意甚好。請趕快把信寫起來，我將親自帶去，俾勿爲他人所見。」</p>
<p>我們隨着叉想到達拉第四週的人，覺得他們也並不是不可爲伍的，所惜達拉第受他們包圍，幾將與世隔絕了似的呢</p>
<p>十一月四日，我交龐納以一信，他馬上送到達拉第那裹。該信措詞如左：</p>
<p>「總理鈞鑒：僕謹本知無不言，言無不盡之旨，草此寸楮，聊充芻蕘之獻。竊願左右於此時對責任及權力二者，深自考慮。數日之內，足下尚能拯救法國及現政府出於危難。否則最後之命運已臨，僕固不必多爲辭費，明達如足下，當能知之綦詳也。</p>
<p>我公聲望播於邇遐，事實昭著，惜足下本人似尚未能重視及之。除公以外，袞袞諸公，危難當前，往往驚惶失措，自愚愚人。君則老成謀國，思盧周詳，以不動搖之意志，抵　各方無情之責難。凡此種種，就道德上言，要皆出於左右之信譽孚人，而爲我人之所欽遲者也。但時至今日，閣下之應加克服者，亦卽在此。</p>
<p>閣下閎聲揮綽，自宜善爲珍襲，否則稍縱卽馳，亦意中事耳。今日法國之所可貢獻者，閣下均可取之，但求爲國，他非所計。惟事不宜遲，處置允須澈底。若或稍有差失，法國又將回復於政治上之分裂與紛亂矣。萬一不幸而至此地步，無論朝野，將無一人更能爲祖國奮鬬，蓋此危機實爲法蘭西開國以來所未有者也。</p>
<p>目下之能登民於袵席者唯公一人而已。因素俱在，不惶枚舉？而其中若干，父爲可遇而不可求者。我人固願隨驥尾，閣下亦殊應順從衆志。以閣下之鳥人，處此環境之中，已不容離羣高蹈，國士無雙，更復何求。誠願左右出以至誠，以內在之奮發，完成所肩之重任。蓋不如是，則悲慘之來，乃不旋踵事耳。</p>
<p>閣下如能貫澈始終，最後勝利可操左券。即不幸而失敗，於良心，於歷史，亦可了無愧作。如一味出以敷衍，凡事不敢開罪於人，或過於小心，腮腮過慮，坐失時機，則失敗又佝能倖免。待至不可收拾之局面，悔之晚矣。</p>
<p>總之成敗得失，已屆最後關頭，惟君自擇自決。僕如不出以嚴重之口吻，殆將無由得見此一時期之危急。目下決非政治家玩弄手腕之時，完成偉大與英雄之事業，閣下已責無旁貸矣。至如何行之，則自決之可耳。</p>
<p>不必求之他人。顧問諮議固無濟於事，卽要人元老，亦豈於事有補。若輩年邁力衰，昏庸老朽，不能與時俱進。苟採納具似是而非之主張，必至亡國滅種始已。而此輩朽腐份子，喟然而嘆，出亡美國，以其「咎在我」之語調，發表其宏論於各雜誌。</p>
<p>僕敬懇左右以自己之主張爲主張，所聽奢惟自已之話。心坎深處，足下當知自己爲共和國民，民主國民，邦國之子。當以赤誠挽救法蘭西之命運，而不僅以口舌爲法國服務也。足下而能俯納芻議者，將予世界民主政治以莫大之貢獻，及新的價值矣。裘羅曼啟」</p>
<p>在信尾，我澴添上一句，吿訴他，我於當晚赴英，預定十一日返法。我歸來之日，達拉第卽召我去談話。我步入聖杜米尼克路他的官舍，見他風采依舊，一如一九二六年春閒所見。他面容較前略爲豐腴，更覺紅潤重實，兩眼於慈祥之中，稍現倦怠，然目光仍極敏銳，談話的聲昔亦與昔無異。他一見我，立刻伸出雙手。</p>
<p>「裘羅曼，你的信於我很爲得益。」</p>
<p>我們隨便談話，大家坦白無私。關於國內國外的一切危險局勢，無所不談。我把在英國所得的觀感和消息都通知他，所述種種，與我信中的主張頗合符節。（未完）</p>

<h3>洋米蠭擁而來　近日內約計有十萬餘包到滬　昨日米市條漲條落大肆操縱</h3>
<p>洋米來源旺盛、太古公司湖北輪自香港裝五千七百三十六包、前日（十二日）到滬、是日因總理誕辰休息、故昨報未曾報告、昨日又有太原輸抵埠、亦由香港運來一千零七十五包、停靠法租界外灘本行碼頭、分別起卸、怡和洋行裕生輪、昨日下午進口、聞亦有米裝來、昨日下午父因休息確數不詳、容再續報、茲悉華綸洋　德達（Norse，Trader）輪此决由貢直接裝來鉅量洋米、計有五萬七千餘包之多、聞該輪昨晚抵吳淞口、今晨可進口、預定停靠浦東鴻興碼頭起卸、又法公司哈定（Khal　Dinh）輪、亦由西貢運來千七百噸、聞其中一部係眞珠米、原定今日到埠、現改明日進口、停虹口華順碼頭起卸、（祖）</p>
<p>昨市洋米忽　忽降、盡量表演操縱者之活動、高低出人竟有三四元之鉅、惟昨日最後結果反比星期收價小去數角至近元、當早市謠言蜂起中、各米一致被其抬高元半至一元、二號西貢到七十元尚圖扳俏、而現貨原包至八十一元牛、市氣極見騰達、繼因許多謠言均經反證爲不確、而盲從之浮囤卽爲售出、午市立小元許、午後又有不利於多頭之和平謠言、人心更虛、業外大戶尤多出籠、搶風之皮球生意立見失勢、市乃冉小元許上午二號七十元者、下午最低小至六十七元半、收市六十八元、上午現貨原包大至八十一元三五角、下午自八十元至七十九　、一號卽裝祇開八十元、尚難儘脫、十二月份上午大至七十八元二角、下午銳落三元二角小至七十五元、十一月份亦降至七十七元、尚有售出、市面倐起倐落、極盡操縱之能事、業外與浮戶似宜及早覺悟、蓋一味盲從、勢必至喪財破家而已也、全日交易現米仍有萬包、原包六七百噸、</p>
<p>新糧尖菉種野稻　、其來源僅賴腳踏車運到千餘石、而本街去路依然暢旺、致市色續俏、各價步升元砠、新粳原包開九十三元九十元、斛見八十九元、八十七兀、野稻九十一元、菉種八十九元、斛見八十六七元、杜尖八十一元、糯米實銷旣旺、大戶仍在吸收、故價亦漲元許、宜溧白元八十元〇五角、次至七十九元半、香　白元特七十七兀至七十四元、糯菉六十八元六十六元、</p>
<h3>麺粉需要頻增　洋粉不久亦將到</h3>
<p>麪粉昨假期後開市之期、現粉交易、頗形活動、乃因米價一再步升、平民之搭食麵粉者、日益衆多、是以本街需要頻增、而各廠批價雖未再漲、而供給已漸限制、統市兩廠批出九千餘包、回籠貨老單棧單、允爲囤戶所垂靑、價達十九元一二三角、尚乏供給、洋粉喊價頻昂、惟因定粉不久將到、人心未免帶餒、故本客均無熱烈之辦興、市面形勢、仍不晚堅靜之局、</p>
<p>新小麥市况、頗形鞏固、蓋以到貸久稀、存底日薄、在目下國際時局變幻聲中、外貨之來源、勢難預測、故人心莫不望好、而日廠吃盤重視、送廠貨仍祇二十一二元、惟聞市傷做開無錫小麥二車、價爲二十六元、市尚平穩、</p>

<h3>金市轉疲　人心動盪不定　今日開始掉期</h3>
<p>昨金市烚赤暗盤、因外滙轉鬆、更在無稽謠風中、已起反動轉疲、但在劇漲不免餘風、故曾起意外之漲勢、一度曾飛出五千八百元外、各方人心仍在動盪不定中、自晨聞外滙已止緊回鬆、故晨開在賣勢下、卽退至五千七百四十元、不意外滙祇管步鬆、而某銀號多頭竟來加碼、更以不及了結之隔夜散多猛抬、曾飛上至五千八百二十五元、終因外滙求緊、漲勢難久、在金號銀號之出籠下潰跌、午刻遂見五千七百三十五元、收市五千七百四十二元、回小二十八元、收後又跌至五千七百十五元、半日交易共的四千兩、下午週三無市、今天（十四日）爲改做現金期交來第一次轉期日、定於下午二點半舉行、據聞大的山空方貼進、多方貼出、約數元或平軋、昨飾金曾高達六百兀、終軋平、爲五百九十元、現金有某錢莊買進、故與期交價軋平、關金等均不更、</p>
<p>烚赤跌念八元</p>
<p>晨初人心觀望、買進無人、開盤價稍見壓低、計金號出銀號十兩、告五千七百四十元、而此後銀號幫在撈、一時竟衛出五千八百元大關、計金號入錢兌業廿兩、創五千八百二十五元頂盤、奈高價不易久持、斯時散戶等莫不乘機出售、霎時又回挫、達五千七百四十五元、嗣經一度盤旋、微見上挺、計銀號人金號二十兩、爲五千七日七十元、惟因外滙已報鬆長、人心又疲、金銀號聯袂塞出、計銀號對做三十兩、重跌至五千七百三十五元、後雖穩定、午收銀號對做十兩、僅有五千七百四十二元、比週一軋小二十八元、半日九十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、較烚赤高十餘元、收進低三十元、現標余照掛牌金低五六十元、均鮮做開、</p>

<h3>大批多頭了結　棉紗下墜　雙馬跌廿元</h3>
<p>連漲數日之紗市、昨則反動下降、目跌風亦熾、此因金子帮多頭大　了結、市面受其壓迫而隨之下墜、香港帮需求繼續健旺、現紗情形米弱、不過投機者獲利了結、市價乃步下、查大戶之額量安然不動矣、又有人說、棉花來源問題、仍難解決也、昨日有棉紗一千二百九十件、今日又有六百八十件運香港、</p>
<p>現紗農開因上日人氣熱烈而續進、二十支雙馬首盤價爲一千二百九十五元、此高價一開、獲利者紛粉了結、同時多說仍水能穿出上次一千三百零二元之高價、因之吐出者益夥、一霎間跌至千一二白八十一元、然外匯開出一度趨縮、實風再現、又升至一千二百九十三元、旋聞外滙轉長、金子帮大量的賣出、檯面轉鬆、某銀行雖來收進、虛風仍難挽、跌至一千二百五十五元收盤、查半日間成交統計六千九百五十五包、行情二十支雙馬跌二十元、茲將各帮口買失之額量、分列如左、</p>

<p>本棉來源仍絕望</p>
<p>現棉情形依然堅昂、且同業心思看好、此因來源仍無法疏通、所以廠方新裕申新兩家辦胃較健、其他平平、但售價仍難趨鬆、火機花爲二百十元、巴西花二百八十八元、彭家浦二百六十三元、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、先因海外棉商之購買而漲、後因華爾街股票市面之稍軟、結果收盤價格、較之上日降三五、磅音、印度連同預測降二羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來繼續靜寂異常、同業及廠方咸抱觀望態度、奈因市上存底不豐、同業心思殊爲高昂、不願廉價出售也、</p>

<p>東布因日紗下降、人心轉虛、晨市浮多吐售、跌風甚劇、龍頭細布自三十六元八角開盤、後一直下瀉最小價喊售三十五元八角、下午同業及染廠家乘廉搜羅、成交殊夥、市氣又堅、龍頭細布收盤爲三十五元九角牛、四君子嗶嘰每碼一元一角、中檔細布尤見需要亦回升三四角、</p>

<p>生油昨日依受投擬家掀風作浪影響、最高　曾比假前漲起一元至一元半、但至收盤時、香港幫忽來吐塞、以致浮囤跟蹤出售、市氣反呈疲弱、結果行情反較前日下挫半元左右、豆油曾被帶起五六角、午後交易頓呈寂寞、統計成交膠州豆油五十件、價爲七十六元五角、靑歧油五十件、七十七元五角、大有廠豆油二百擔、八十五元五角至八十五元二角半、膠州生油五白件、七十六元至七十五元、十一月下交二百件、七十六元至七十四兀七角半、靑島生油二百桶、一百〇四元至一百〇五元、收盤爲一百〇四元二角半、十二月下交一千餘桶、一百〇四元七角半至一百〇六元、復瀉全一百〇四元、十一月下交二百桶、價爲一百〇四元二角半至一百〇三元二角半、又烟臺生油五十件、七十五元二角半、</p>
<p>豆子十三日、自天津運來一千四百包、又同日出口麻油五百十聽、豆子七百九十包運香港、十四日又有豆子一百包運香港、三百包運小呂宋、生仁二百包述香港、</p>
<p>煤炭</p>
<h3>煙煤屑預買忙</h3>
<p>烟煤屑各貨在冬令中、本屬旺銷季節、本年水汀用戶、因感去歲該貨斷檔缺俏情狀、紛紛事前購辦、儲藏防荒、生意益形鬧熱、賣價亦在扳持下、節節昇高、昨做印度烟煤屑每噸一百八十元、婆羅洲屑一百七十五元、開平屑一百六十八元、均以均同業行拆、外費另加、</p>
<p>五金</p>
<h3>純銻步高</h3>
<p>邇來國產純銻市况、又趨良好、蓋來源雖香港仍能不時運滬、然爲數並不大、且抵埠後、父爲幾家同業所操縱、致行盤亦隨彼等所信口開河、聞　由某機關搜往頗夥、而開價亦步好、每噸沽八千二百元、較之前市復昂達二百元之譜、</p>
<p>藥材</p>
<h3>胡椒去路零星</h3>
<p>胡椒　來客銷淸寂、成交僅有零星、售價遂見挫落、刻市黑大椒與一號椒爲一百零四元、比前小一元、白椒跌度較烈、如文島貨售一百九十八元、荷蘭貨一百八十五兀、須小去五六元、</p>

<p>運歐寒衣　改運來滬</p>
<p>據昨日大陸報載、過去數月中、本埠費州敎友會分會收到由澳洲及新西蘭各地捐來之寒衣數小批、遂卽轉交救世軍·歐洲猶民救濟委員會·及其他慈善機關等、發送本埠少數貧寒難民、上星期問、美國大宗塞衣、本擬運歐作救濟之用、但因交通困難、留滯　國、後鑒於上海難民亦正需此項救濟、乃擬轉運來滬、該消息傳抵此間後、費州敎友會卽由美領署轉電美國敎友會總部敦、促速將留美之大宗寒衣、輸滬以應急需、聞此宗寒衣、計有兩大包云、</p>

<h3>在華之美敎士　不願放棄使命　淪陷區敎士均繼續奮　非至最後關頭決不捨去　美國務院派牧師來滬商決步驟</h3>
<p>關於美僑自遠東撤退問題、據記者向本埠各美敎會總辦事處調查所得、全中國美敎士、雖準備遵守美政府之命令、但目下尚不願離職、各敎會對於撒僑命令、仍在討論中、現正由於三日前抵滬羅柏芝牧師、於昨日與其在滬同志、商訂美敎會應採之政策、聞羅牧師乃國務院邀請來滬、與各敎會討論撒退事宜者、據羅牧師稱、對於此事、渠不擬提出任何建議、在自由中國之美國敎會、幾全不撤退、淪陷區內美敎士撒退興否　聽各人自決、惟年高或體弱者、均以預早撇退爲妥、</p>
<p>離華敎士　人數寥寥</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、頃據熟悉敎務人士聲稱、美國政府近勸遠東美僑撒退、以遠東乃無最有潛在危險的地點之一也、惟在華活動巳一百十一年之美國基督敎傳敎士、不致大批離華、而放棄其終生工作、目今散居中國各地之美敎士、共的二千三百人、其將搭美末艘撒僑輸華盛頓號、於本月二十一日離滬返美者、不足一百五十人、</p>
<p>絕無理由　大舉撤退</p>
<p>美國派來中國從事敎會工作之敎士、通常約二千八百人、目下在美休假者約五百人、另有五十人、已從美國政府之勸、與敎會總部之囑而離華、此外、或將在下週或十天內撇離中國之敎士、約一百人、已往三年來在淪陷區工作之敎士、有少數人將調往自由中國擔任新職、但絕無預料敎士將大舉撇退之理由、蓋敎會人員、決賡續進行其工作至最後一分鐘爲止也、</p>
<p>美國敎士　集中沿海</p>
<p>自由中國境內之美敎士、非但絕無一人離境、目有增多之勢、其業已撇退或行將離境者、皆係駐淪陷區之敎士、惟在華美敎會與他國敎會、所處地位不同、因美敎會大多集中日方控制之沿海各區也、查在華各國敎士、共約六千人、內以美敎士二千八百人之數爲最多、英敎士的五百人、餘皆默洲他國之敎士、美敎士西分之三、集中於河北至福建沿海諸省、</p>
<p>非至危急　決不言旋</p>
<p>在內地則他國敎士佔多數、如四川省之加拿大敎士、倍於他國敎士、湖北·湖南·山西·與陝西諸省、則多挪威·瑞典與英國敎士、日方苟在具侵佔區從事反美運動、則美敎士處培自極困難、而將被迫移入內地工作、惟美敎士皆感如果離境、適投日方所好、再者、美敎士撇退、耗資既巨、返國後、一時難以安挿、而何時始准再來中國、亦未可知、上海基督敎四大學學生極多、執敎之敎士六十人、經騐豐足、設皆離去、對於華籍學生之敎育便利、乃一重大阻碍、如果局勢惡化至極、美敎士終至迫不獲已而離境、亦不致與中國永別、</p>

<p>新輪下水</p>
<p>美航務部、認爲擴展遠東航務、實爲當務之急、且爲適應世界及遠東航運需要、決定積　擴充美國海上事業、美國總統輪公司建造新型萬噸巨輸七艘、由美駛來上海、加入遠東行駛、並環航世界航綫、及行駛太平洋航綫、第一艘新輪傑克遜總統號、業於本年九月中落成下水、現正裝修內部艙位、將於本月下旬、自美首途、開來遠東、的下月十二日可抵埠、然後由上海赴南洋、作世界環行處女航、</p>
<p>十年計劃</p>
<p>此後海上貨運事宜、美當局亦積極派輪承運、此事一時雖不能實現、但於十年內、據負責人語記者、美貨輪將擴充至五百艘、其中三百五十艘、在速東太平洋大西洋航行、其餘一百五十艘、作爲補充之用、此種航運事業網、一旦完成、行見雄視歐亞各地、按美航務會駐遠東代表詹森、於一九一九年卽來遠東、常川往來於香港與上海之間、負責美國航務事宜、</p>
<p>港灣復航</p>
<p>至於英法輪行駛香港越南上海航綫一事、自日軍於九月二十五日侵犯起南後、英輪卽行停航海防西貢航錢、法輪繼之停航、廣州灣亦在其列、此事影響上海香港廣州灣之貨運甚鉅、據記者所獲可恃消息、現英海軍部當局、以時局轉弛、且曾與法關係方面、商洽妥當、業已准許英法輸先行復航港　航綫、對恢復越南各口岸航行、將於短期內談判、作最後決定、惟復航尚有待耳</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<p>自由辯論婦女往那裹去？（四）</p>
<h3>婦女回家庭去</h3>
<p>— 祺齋</p>
<p>（六）婦女與自立：在任何塲所，憑自己力量間接或直接爲社會作有利工作而換到酬報以維持生活，都是自立。婦女也是這樣，只要不終日遊蕩，能憑自己力量做有利工作，像敎養子女等，來獲得酬報以維持她的生活，絕對不是依賴於人。</p>
<p>（七）婦女與家庭：家庭原是男和女在生理·心理·環境需要之下結合起來的互助團體，家庭旣是由需要結成的，那末家庭之中的一切一切，當然最適合於婦女的需要而得發揮她特有本能以成就她的偉大事業。至於現在家庭的不合理或婦女受到輕視壓迫，那因爲大家沒有明瞭造成家庭的「原因」，更不知道歸女在家庭裹的重要，也因婦女自己也沒有知道本身的重要所致。所以只要一方面使大家明瞭造成家庭的「原因」，去除錯誤觀念，那末家庭就會合理。一方面婦女自己發揮她本能上的力量，使她成爲一個負有巨大責任的重要份子，那就不會被輕視壓迫了。</p>
<p>（八）結論；留心婦女問題的人，（不一定社會學家）不滿現狀而想加以改良，無非感到婦女的生活不合理而己。現在，婦女在生理上需要一個能供紿她自山工作自由休息的塲所以完成「生育特能」的工作，在心理上需要發揮她「母愛特能」的工作，社會國家需要合理環境讓婦女產生健全人民，婦女更需耍在合理環境裏完成一種自立而適合她生理心理特能的事業，而「家庭」呢，剛好能容納以上種種需要，那末「婦女到家庭裏去」是最合理而應該的了。</p>
<h3>婦女上社會去</h3>
<p>— 亦蕙</p>
<p>（六）婦女與自立：在前面，我們會說過，婦女爲了要發展個性之所長，所以必須有職業。在這段裹，我們要說，婦女爲了經濟上的獨立，也應各有職業。一個婦女是吾依賴他人，是要以經濟條件來決定的。魯迅先生說，婦女倘不得到和男子同等的經濟權，所有的名目，都是空。我們看見許多的婦女，終年在家管理家事，養育孩子，他們的丈夫却終日在外面打牌，跳舞，盡可能地享樂和浪費。妻子對於他們的行動是不能干涉的，因爲他們用的是他們自己賺來的錢，他們有充分的支配權。婦女所能支配的，只是丈夫按月交給她們的家用。有一部分的婦女，竟運這一點權利，也被丈夫剝削了。婦女生活在這種的情形下，還不是「被養」的和依賴的一羣嗎？</p>
<p>（七）婦女與家庭：一個構成家庭的分子，不諭是男女或兒童，都是重要的。我們不必强調婦女在家庭中的重要。我常聽見人說，一個沒有正常職業的男子，在家裹常是一個最壞的丈夫。婦女叉何嘗不是這樣？婦女假如有正當的職業，在她業餘回家之後，對孩子會特別感覺興趣，對於丈夫的事業，能有更深刻的了解。由於彼此工作經騐的分享，和思想上相互的勉勵，他們的家庭生活，也必更豐富，更快樂和更有意義！而且，根據許多職業婦女的經騐，整天地和孩子處在一起，是還不如在固定的時問和兒童作伴，對母子都有更良好的影響。</p>
<p>（八）結論：最後，我要講的是，我們要討論婦女往那裏去的問題，是要以中國往那裹去爲先決條件的。假如我們所想望的是一個眞正的三民主義的民主共和國的社會，那麼，一切人民應享的平等和自由也是婦女應享的權利。我們不能設想一個眞正的民主國家，能够把它佔牛數的婦女關在家裏，不容許她們站在與男子平等的地位來發展他們的特長，爲國家和人類造幸福。但是，假如我們所爺望的一個社會是少數人壓迫和剝削多數人的非民主的社會—這「我們」當然是屬於少數特權階級的—那麼，我們當然是不　意婦女享受自由與平等，正如我們不願意大多數的民衆享受自由與平等一樣。我們在沒有討論婦女往那裹去的問題以前，應該先檢討一下我們對於社會問題的觀點和態度是不楚正確的。時代的輸子是向前進的，那些要把歷史的輸子向後轉的份子，終必要被時代的潮流所淘汰的！（完）</p>

<h3>一九四〇年禦寒妙品</h3>
<p>— 水之</p>
<p>當我整天的在馬路上踱着，終見到了不少的公子哥兒，摩登小姐。他們同她們身上所穿着的衣服，總覺得輕鬆單薄，柔軟舒適，活現出他們同她們的丯姿，更覺得格外的摩登，雖則天氣已達初冬，馬路上已凍死了不少回不得家鄉去的人們，可是在他們同她們並不爲了穿着單薄，而怕寒冷，某天卻巧被我發覺了，原來他們同她們的衣服，都用緯綸毛織廠出品的老虎牌「兔子絨」或「駱駝絨」來做襯裏，無怪得輕軟經着，艷麗雅緻，並且據老上海的告我：「可以担保永久不脫毛，同旁的駱駝羢完令不同，最使得人們驚異的，緯綸毛織廠出品的「兔子絨」，還可以來給一般摩登小姐做短大衣，顏色分門別類，不下數十種，就是年紀大一點的人們，也總歡喜着老虎牌「兔子絨」「駱駝絨」，因爲可使行走方便，雅觀大方，但是千萬要給讀奢們知道的，當你跑進一家公司，或一家綢布局，莫忘記了緯綸毛織廠出品的老虎牌「兔子絨」「駱駝羢」，每碼背面均貼有老虎商標，及藍色長方老虎牌圖章，否則讀者們容易上當，漸漸地冷起來，請趕快買吧！</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第十一章　趙伯雄的供詞</p>
<p>霍桑又把關門時放下的裁紙刀重新拿在手裹，略略抬起些目光，答道：關於這一點，我雖還沒有得到充分切實的材料，但我可以猜想得到，這女子是個意志薄弱的人。說起米也怪可憐，伊從純樸渾厚的農村社會裹出來，陷進了物質社會的洪爐，便身不由主地墮落下去。伊已沉淪任享樂放縱的洪流中，爲了金錢的目的，什麼事都幹得出，出賣肉體，出賣靈魂，出賣羣衆，甚至出賣一切！」</p>
<p>趙伯雄連連點頭說：「對，對，伊正是這樣一個人物。我奉派到這裏來，原有著特殊的任務。同時我聽得有一種陰謀活動，主持的是個交際花。我覺我這也在我的使命範圍以內，就着手偵查伊的行動，進一步再打消伊的企圖。我知道伊雖巳退出舞塲，但伊仍舊利用舞塲從事伊的非法的活動，專找公務人員進攻。我費了相當的功夫才得和伊接近。這女子眞是絕頂聰明，不多幾天，伊也已覺察到我的任務。伊竟敢將機就機，來一個「反累司」。換一句說，伊竟想利用我做伊的工具了。所以起初是我　了方法接近伊，後來伊反而想盡計策來接近我。伊曾兩次到我的寓所裹去過夜。第一次伊不曾得到什麼。第二决就是大前天十六晚上，伊乘我熟睡的當兒，要想竊取我的秘密。伊曾檢查我的皮包，衣袋，和枕頭，終於在我的枕頭套裏面，偷了一張密電碼去。」</p>
<p>趙伯雄停頓了，重新把白巾摸出來，反摺了一下，又抹拭他的面頰。霍桑利用這個時間，又淡淡地說了一句。</p>
<p>「你也太疏忽了。你旣然担任了重要的任務，怎麼竟敢讓眞個跟這樣的女子勾搭，讓伊在你的房間裹過夜？你的要件又不小心妥藏，睡時又這樣懵懂。你大概巳當眞陷進了伊的圏套，給伊迷住了！」這幾句話的聲調，嚴冷得眞像一個上司當面申斥他的下屬。</p>
<p>趙伯雄瞧見了霍桑那種鐵一般冷的面容，臉上浮出一重紅色，也禁不住有些羞愧。他低沉了頭，緩聲答道：「霍先生，我眞該死！我不敢抵賴，這一着的確是錯誤的。不過那被盜竊的電碼已經失了時效，原是沒有價値的。那有效的一張，我藏在呢帽圈裹，伊並沒有發覺。所以伊的行動，我在下一天還沒有發覺，直到昨天早晨，我才知道枕頭套裹的那張過時電碼巳被伊偷去。這一來才證實伊的確是一個危險組織中的中心人物。我就決意採取緊急的行動制裁伊。咋天傍晚，我到伊寓裹去找伊，沒有找着，知道伊和姓陸的出去了。我料想他們總在什麼餐館裹，果然在白梅酒家裹給我我漪。」　（一六五）</p>
<p>小談</p>
<h3>燕與雁</h3>
<p>— 秀碧</p>
<p>風冷很，是過晚秋了。</p>
<p>秋曾有高朗的碧空，和潔自的雲朶的。</p>
<p>而點綴了這高空和白雲的，彷彿在藍白的畫布上，劃上了細長的黑線的，是燕和雁。</p>
<p>燕和雁，這是二種成羣的候烏啊！牠們是秋的微象。</p>
<p>有了牠們，寂寞的秋便有了生意，有了牠們，生長在秋天裹的人們，便感到了生的意味。</p>
<p>牠們是昂着頭，張着翅，遠遠地飛來了飛去了。</p>
<p>在靑天和白雲之間，牠們是黑的紐長的線條。</p>
<p>孩子們抬起頭看見了牠們就嘆息。</p>
<p>詩人把牠們寫到韻文裹，而音樂家把牠們塡到了譜裹。</p>
<p>但牠們卻不知道這一切，牠們只是飛着飛着昂着頭，搏着翅，在靜寂的高空成羣地趕着路。</p>
<p>牠們越過了不少的城市，村鎭，高山，叢林和深海，牠們的雙翅也許有疲乏的時候，但牠們卻不會因而停留的。爲了求得溫暖和求得生存，牠們是向前飛，向前飛着，一直飛到牠們的目的地？</p>
<p>而到了春天，牠們又各自飛回去，昂着頭，張着翅牠們終生都生活在這長距離的飛翅裏，牠們是喜歡長征的勇士呢</p>
<p>牠們的身體並不雄偉，牠們沒有鷹的强壯也沒有鷲的威武，使得牠們飛行了如此久長的道路的，誰都知道是牠們的勇敢，牠們的持久和牠們的堅强的意志。</p>
<p>勇敢，持久，堅强，誰有了這些，不能行走遼遠的長途呢！</p>
<p>看呵！在碧雲與白雲之間，雁和燕又在昂着頭，張着翅，唱着歌曲而長征着了，胆怯的人們呵！抬起你們的頭吧！</p>

<h3>西藏的電影　漁光曲在拉薩連映三月西藏同胞渴望祖國影片</h3>
<p>— 中藝</p>
<p>（拉薩特約通訊）西藏的電影，一向是在英人的支配之下，西藏的「拉薩」，有幾家大規模有聲戲院，建築設備都是非常的現代化，但全為英人所經營，所演的片子也十之九為英國出品。還有二三家藏民所辦的影院，則為三四流影院，院內破敗不堪，價最低，所演的全是最陳舊的片子，觀衆也是一些最窮苦的人物。</p>
<p>西藏因受到英國文化的影響，英語在那裏還流行普遍，所以英片在西藏並不使人感覺不便，因此影業整個為英人所佔。但是　年來不然了，西藏對於我國國產片却熱烈歡迎，那部「漁光曲」曾到過「拉薩」，使西藏從來未見過國片的觀衆，如發現新大陸的狂歡。「漁光曲」原定在「拉薩」上演二星期，結果成續却出乎意外，連續上演了三個月，觀衆始終擁擠不堪，「看中國片去！」「看中國片去！」成了西藏民衆們娛樂的口號。後來又連續運往幾部國產片去，都得到「漁光曲」的同樣效果。</p>
<p>西藏的同胞，渴望着祖國的影片給予他們精神上的安慰！</p>

<p>侯玉蘭有一回演孔雀東南飛，表演舉着紅燈，給婆母斥責，不知安放在那裏是好時，忽然火燄把紙燈上的紗罩沿燒着了，王蘭大窘，行吹行滅，行滅行吹，態度頗為難堪，那時飾婆母的張金樑，忙把燈搶在手裏，臨時抓眼道：「你別氣死我啦，連燈都不知放在那裏，還差點兒燒了」可是燈到了金樑的手中，還是着了二回，竟是無法自圓其說，台下　然。</p>
<p>彈詞人物</p>
<h3>「描王」夏荷生</h3>
<p>— 聿修</p>
<p>夏荷生無疑是現在彈詞界數一數二的大嚮擋，他是浙江嘉善人，夏姓原是嘉善望族，世居「夏廳」，在當地又是個有名的地方。他的父親以善繪神佛肖像，有聲於時，所以他從小就秉有愛好藝術的天性，而又酷嗜音律，以這樣一種人村，來從業彈詞，自然是最合於理想了。</p>
<p>他帥事　幼卿，習描金鳳，三笑二書，而描金鳳尤所擅長，十餘年釆，即以此書獨步書壇，博得「描王」頭銜。中間曾有一度因事被擯於光裕社，無從得業，後經同道　　，纔能重　一弦，登壇鬻技。</p>
<p>夏荷生頎長王立，風度翩翩，面相當漂亮。其有一副久唱不壞的好喉嚨，嗓音嘹亮淸爽，字眼個個飽綻，抑揚疾徐無不合度中節，操縱自如，大足過聽各才癮。而表情脚色，尤能刻劃人微，傳神阿堵，且每唱一回書，都是始終不懈的在認眞唱作，從不有偷工减料，濫做不相干的噱顛同穿揷，來糟蹋聽客的長光，這是他的長處。不過缺點也並不是沒有，自負高，脾氣大，平常的塲子，輕易「扳」不動他，而且聽客一「漂」，馬上就「剪」，所以他近年來老是找不到一個比較滿意的地盤，就是吃了這個缺點的大虧。</p>
<p>誠如已故大嚮擋葉聲揚的說法，「一個大嚮擋的造成，雖不一定完全是靠着他的本領，可是也並不能完全可以倖致的。全才難得，只要一技之長，就不難爭得有一個相常的地位了。一夏荷生就是靠着他唱做的長處，爭來今日「描王」的地位的。至於他的缺點，雖則是一般大嚮擋的通病，我們始終還是希望他能够「有則改之，無則加勉」的。</p>
<h3>好萊塢影星的輕鬆消息</h3>
<p>— 莎薇</p>
<p>新嫁娘洛麗泰楊，共有姊妹四人，大姊名寶蘭安（Polly　Ann），是個不作事的小姐；二姊賽蘭白莉（Sally　Blane）也是個電影演員，不過浚有那位三小姐洛麗泰楊來得出名；現在洛麗泰楊預備把她上五歲的小妹妹琪羅琴納（Georgiana），也帶進攝影塲工作，據說那位小妹妹相貌和洛麗泰楊一般無二，性情也與她相似。</p>
<p>一度曾傳失踪之瑪德琳卡洛兒，現已同她老母安全回來，但她這次不知有否帶一個漂亮的法國飛行員的丈夫回來，記得她第一任丈夫，也是個軍隊（英國的）中人，名叫　列浦亞斯脫利。</p>
<p>蓓蒂黛維絲自完成「再生緣」之後，曾去夏威夷旅行一次，拍了許多美麗的風景照，帶回來作紀念。</p>
<p>新歌后伊洛娜瑪珊和美少年亞倫寇梯斯發生了戀愛，差不多每天晚上都在一起玩，米高梅當局對於這件事感覺很是不滿，他們覺得這樣的羅曼史是會影響到伊洛娜的錦繡前程；現在好萊塢有許多人在打賭，大多數的人以為米高梅的勸阻是亳無效用的。</p>
<p>有人因為看見茀羅瑜斯拉絲常和白勞特里克勞馥在一起，就散流言，說她和華爾可克斯的愛情破裂了。拉絲為了這事，曾有過一次慎車的聲明，她說：「和華爾可克斯的愛情是還和以前一樣，但你總不能叫我每天晚上在家裏枯坐着，在鮑柏出去的時候，你能够嗎？」</p>
<h3>狄安娜竇萍三度被吻</h3>
<p>— 保羅</p>
<p>狄安娜竇萍，已經具有優美的少婦型了，她可以表演正在戀愛中的女子，所以她近來所拍的影片，作風上和以前也有一些變換了。</p>
<p>在「初戀」一片裏，她初度在影片中與人接吻，對象是羅勃史旦克，有好些人都羨慕他的幸運。第二次是在「花月佳期」中對象是華爾德畢勤，不過實際上華爾德只用嘴唇吻她的前額，因為按照劇情，華爾德的年齡要長得多。</p>
<p>狄安娜竇萍的第三次被吻是在「春之行列Spring　Parade」中，現在攝製中，男主角是羅勃克敏士，因為他穿着軍士的服裝，並且能　奏鋼琴和提琴，所以她愛上了他。</p>
<p>這一部新片，在監製人喬派斯脫納克，導演亨利考斯脫共同合作下，將有更好的成績，因為以一八九六年的時代，維也納的背景，而歌舞的塲面，從一個鄕村的集會到皇宮的舞，給予主演者很多發揮演技的機會。</p>

<h3>Registration Deadline for Military Civilian Personnel</h3>
<p>Chongqing – The Regulations on the Registration of Incumbent Military Civilian Personnel and the Regulations on the Transfer of Military Civilian Personnel to Ordinary Civil Service Positions have been promulgated and implemented by the National Government.

The Military Affairs Commission requested a temporary postponement of implementation. Now, the Commission, considering that many military organs have requested that the registration of military civilian personnel, which is still pending, be held, has specifically consulted with the Personnel Department of the Commission and obtained the consent of the Ministry of Personnel. It has drafted the procedures for the registration of military civilian personnel of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, with the period from October 1, 1940, to the end of September 1941, as the registration period.

<h3>National Father's Birthday – Chairman Lin's Speech</h3>
<p>Chongqing – At the memorial service held by the central authorities to commemorate the National Father's birthday, Chairman Lin reported on "The Significance of Commemorating the National Father's Birthday," stating, in brief: "Ladies and gentlemen, today is the birthday of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the National Father of our party, the Kuomintang, and the Republic of China. As we hold this meeting to commemorate the birthday of the National Father who created the Republic of China on this day, which marks the fourth year of the Sino-Japanese War, we feel a particularly great and profound significance."</p>
<p>"First, we must deepen our understanding of the spirit of revolution led by the National Father. The National Father lived during the autocratic era of the Qing Dynasty. At that time, political corruption reached its extreme. Domestically, after the oppression of the Qing Dynasty and the Taiping Rebellion, the nation's strength was depleted, the people suffered, and the officialdom was so corrupt that it could not be revived. Externally, it suffered from incessant aggression by the great powers, signing many treaties that ceded sovereignty and humiliated the country, placing the nation in a semi-colonial position. Seeing this situation, the National Father felt that without launching a revolution to overthrow autocracy and establish a republic, the country had no hope of reform. Therefore, from his childhood studies, he resolved to study the principles of governing the country and bringing peace to the world, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign. He finally created the epoch-making Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution, embraced a spirit of great fearlessness, cried out loudly, traveled at home and abroad, successively organized the Revive China Society and the Revolutionary Alliance, and finally organized the Kuomintang, calling on comrades and awakening compatriots across the country to unite and fight together. The National Father resolved to make a revolution, create revolutionary doctrines, and he himself not only spoke but also acted. He acted and failed, but he was not discouraged or depressed. Instead, the more he failed, the more he fought. No matter how difficult the environment, he always persevered and made persistent efforts, leading his comrades to advance bravely. This noble and great spirit of revolutionary leadership should be cherished by us. This is the first point that we should bring to everyone's attention today as we commemorate the National Father's birthday."</p>
<p>"Second, the National Father advocated the National Revolution with the aim of achieving China's independence, freedom, and equality. The explanation of independence, freedom, and equality is to seek self-preservation internally and co-existence externally. If we do not achieve this goal one day, we cannot stop our efforts towards revolution for one day. We recognize that Japan is a strong country in East Asia and geographically closest to us China. It should have the clearest understanding of our revolutionary goals and should come forward to help us. However, the reality is the opposite. Japan has never wanted an independent, free, and prosperous China to coexist and prosper with it. It not only does not help our revolution but also conspires to undermine our revolution and even directly uses force to attack our revolution. There are countless such facts. Everyone must know it clearly, so there is no need to say more today. But can our revolutionary action be terminated because of Japan's jealousy, sabotage, and attacks? Every true descendant of the Yellow Emperor and disciple of the National Father will never tolerate this humiliation. Since the creation of the 'September 18th' and 'July 7th' incidents, Japan's consistent ambition to invade China by force has been fully exposed. If we do not rise up to defend ourselves, then the goal of the National Revolution that the National Father showed us will never be realized. This is the second point that we should bring to everyone's attention today as we commemorate the National Father's birthday."</p>
<p>"Third, we must defend the national policy and strive for final victory. It is our supreme national policy today. Since the Provisional National Congress of our Party decided on this policy two years ago, the people of the whole country have already recognized and supported it unanimously. Unexpectedly, later, a small number of people lost their stand on the revolution and misinterpreted the National Father's words on Pan-Asianism, righteousness, peace, struggle, and saving China, using them as amulets. They do not know that the Pan-Asianism advocated by the National Father is planar, not three-dimensional. All Asian countries should be treated equally, respect each other, and never have the inferior thought of relying on others and being a vassal. As for peace, struggle, and saving China, it means that peace does not forget struggle. Only peace achieved through struggle is the peace of independence, freedom, and equality. They forget struggle and only seek peace. The kind of peace obtained without one's own strength must be a peace of submission, a peace of slavery. Where is true peace? Now, because Japan has invaded China by force and fought for more than three years, the war has no solution. It is fantasizing and fabricating various rumors of peace to shake our people's hearts. How can it know that our national policy has long been decided? The Japanese people's rumors have been broken by our iron-like facts. This is the third point that we should bring to everyone's attention today as we commemorate the National Father's birthday."</p>
<p>"In short, the leader of our party is the National Father who created the Republic of China. Only with the leader, then there is our party. Only with our party, then there is the National Revolution. Only with the National Revolution, then there is the Republic of China that struggles for survival. Only with the Republic of China that struggles for survival, then there is the long-term war of aggression against Japan. Today, we are celebrating the National Father's birthday, at a time when the Sino-Japanese War has entered its fourth year and victory is gradually approaching. The strength of the Japanese is being consumed day by day. As long as we follow the revolutionary spirit shown to us by the National Father, muster up the courage to advance bravely, and strive for final victory." (12th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japan's New Posture in its Diplomacy with the United States</h3>
<p>Coincidentally with Molotov's invitation to Germany, Japan's diplomacy with the United States has also begun to take on a new and active approach. Starting with a two-hour meeting on the 10th of this month between Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka and US Ambassador Grew. The content is said to be a review of the details of US-Japan relations, followed immediately by the appointment of General Nomura as the successor to Ambassador Horinouchi to the United States. At the same time, there are rumors that the Japanese side will be led by Foreign Minister Matsuoka to visit the United States with a delegation on a goodwill mission. Although the possibility of this rumor being realized is extremely small, it is sufficient to show the Japanese side's eagerness to improve US-Japan relations. The international situation, which was slightly clarified by the Tripartite Alliance, has once again fallen into confusion due to the new form of existence between the Soviet Union and Germany. This movement in Japan's diplomacy with the United States undoubtedly adds even more clouds, fog, complexity and confusion.</p>
<p>According to unconfirmed reports yesterday: Negotiations on the Soviet-Japanese non-aggression pact seem to be approaching. No matter how much the Soviet Union does not change its position on the Far East and aid to China, the rapprochement between the Soviet Union and Germany will inevitably reduce the distance between the Soviet Union and Japan. Japan's closeness to the Soviet Union is intended to facilitate its southward advance and to confront the United Kingdom and the United States. According to common sense, it seems that now is the time for Japan to become tougher on the United States. Examining Japanese public opinion after Roosevelt was elected for the third time, almost everyone believes that the path to US-Japan rapprochement has been blocked. However, the recent diplomatic maneuvers by the Japanese authorities are not only beyond the expectations of the world but also quite different from the general views of the Japanese. The message here is worthy of serious attention.</p>
<p>Before the facts on all sides are fully clarified, it is advisable to give perspective from different angles. First, the signing of the Tripartite Alliance originally violated the wishes of most Japanese public opinion. If it can truly achieve the effect of deterring the United Kingdom and the United States and strengthening its own position, then the resentment in public opinion may gradually dissipate into nothing. However, for more than a month, it has only invited pressure from the United Kingdom and the United States, further exacerbating the inability of Japan's rights and obligations to offset each other. Moreover, the military and political situation in Germany and Italy has deteriorated with each passing day, leaving them in a state of advancement and retreat. Japan, which originally intended to benefit itself, cannot but seek another path to find a way out. This kind of intention was already sprouting when the United States' tough attitude towards Japan was first revealed, and now it has evolved into practical measures. Second, Japan's southward advance has indeed become like an arrow on a string. However, with the complexity of the political situation in South Asia, the weakness of military preparations, and the lack of a collective defense system, the path to economic seizure and victory without fighting has not been completely blocked. However, it is necessary to take advantage of the relaxation of attention of the United Kingdom and the United States and the fact that its relationship with Japan is not yet completely rigid, as it did previously in northern Vietnam. For this purpose, Japan must continue to seek reconciliation and deception with the United Kingdom and the United States - especially with the United States. Third, the situation in the European war is now on the eve of rapid development. It is still difficult to determine immediately whether it will be beneficial or harmful to Japan. Therefore, the Japanese side still needs to wait and see for a while for a favorable opportunity to come. Therefore, it cannot but temporarily seek to reduce the heavy pressure from the United States, which has been increasing. Fourth, although the rapprochement between the Soviet Union and Germany is sufficient to promote the progress of Soviet-Japanese negotiations, on the other hand, it will inevitably promote the deterioration of relations between the United Kingdom and the United States and arouse the revival of anti-Soviet sentiment among the upper echelons of the United Kingdom and the United States. This is indeed another opportunity for Japan to ease relations with the United Kingdom and the United States. The Japanese side cannot but imagine taking advantage of this opportunity to reap the benefits of sitting on the fence. Fifth, for economic reasons, Japan cannot completely get rid of its dependence on the United Kingdom and the United States before its so-called East Asian economic group plan has achieved tangible results. The stagnation of its foreign trade, the deterioration of its international balance of payments, the panic of various resources, and the radical nature of inflation have all forced the Japanese authorities to temporarily seek a turnaround in relations with the United States to save its economic crisis. Sixth, Japan's response to the Western powers has always been to divide the United Kingdom and the United States as its main strategy. At present, it is not permissible for Japan's strength to be at odds with both the United Kingdom and the United States. If it is possible to reduce the antipathy of the United States, then the United Kingdom's inability to cope with the European situation should not constitute a major problem for the Japanese side. In short, the main motives behind Japan's recent diplomatic gestures towards the United States are probably nothing more than the above speculations. Therefore, this is not Matsuoka's own self-contempt, going back on his previous remarks about abolishing flattery diplomacy, but rather is limited by the various practical difficulties at present and cannot but take a roundabout route to cope. Inside this conciliatory cloak, it is still the same old face. This is also not a failure of Japanese radicalism, because its intention is ultimately to facilitate the success of the radical agenda. Although there is a considerable rift between Konoe and the military, and Matsuoka's diplomatic views are not entirely consistent with those of Toshio Shiratori, it is absolutely impossible to imagine that they have reached the point of knowing the way back or fundamentally repenting under the current political situation in Japan.</p>
<p>However, this kind of operation is at most a repetition of the old tune that Abe Ugaki has already failed. A year or two ago, it was still sufficient to achieve practical results, let alone today. The Japanese side's posture is mainly aimed at the current chaotic international situation and its own weakness that its preparations have not been completed. It may be that there will be changes soon. The future of the European situation is indeed worrisome. However, it is expected that the Soviet Union will not greatly change its neutral position and be excessively biased, and the Pacific problem, as pointed out in yesterday's editorial in this newspaper, is not something that the Soviet Union and Germany can control. Furthermore, Japan's current operations are entirely for its own sake. As far as the obligations of the Tripartite Alliance are concerned, they are clearly not welcomed by Germany and Italy. On the other hand, the United States' Far East policy and China's firm resistance war will never be shaken by the complex trends in the international community and Japan's unilateral wishes. This can be asserted.</p>
<h3>Hull Meets with Secretaries of War and Navy to Strengthen the Strength of the Philippines; US-UK-Australia Pacific Joint Defense Issue to Continue Negotiations After Lothian Returns to the United States</h3>
<p>Washington – As it is gradually becoming apparent here that the United States is about to increase its naval and military strength in the Philippines, according to news last night, talks between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia on Pacific joint defense will soon resume. Australian Minister to Washington Casey announced last night that talks between the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia on Pacific defense could resume soon after British Ambassador Lothian returned to Washington from London. Casey made the announcement after meeting with Secretary of State Hull again yesterday. Casey said that the issue of the South Pacific would be given special consideration after Lord Lothian returned to Washington. The Secretaries of War and Navy yesterday met with Hull for more than two hours to discuss the possibilities and consequences of effectively increasing the United States' defense strength in the Philippines. Secretary of War Stimson and Secretary of the Navy Knox refused to comment on the content of their meeting with Hull. They both said that the content of the talks should be announced by Hull. Sources said that the decision involved a plan to enhance the United States' defenses in the Pacific. News here for some time has indicated that the government is considering strengthening the United States' naval and military strength in the Philippine Islands. Observers recalled last night that Knox told reporters when announcing the Navy Department's recent purchase of several oil tankers and other auxiliary ships, saying that these ships were for the exclusive use of the US fleet. He said that the ships would be moved by the US fleet in "any part of the Pacific." (13th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Three States in Eastern America: Pharmaceutical Factory Explosions; Federal Bureau Commences Extensive Investigation; Evidence Points to Strong Possibility of Strikes</h3>
<p>Washington – The Federal Bureau of Investigation last night commenced an extensive investigation into the explosions resulting in multiple deaths and injuries in the three eastern states. The fact that two of the explosions occurred in factories filling national defense orders strongly suggests a strong possibility of strikes. According to a statement by Mr. Dai, chairman of the Non-American Activities Committee, he received a phone call from Washington reporting that ten instances of strike activity had already occurred, a rate possibly related to the recent explosions. However, he declined to elaborate further or disclose the locations of the strikes. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<p>Woodbridge, New Jersey, USA – A munitions factory in New Jersey suffered repeated explosions yesterday, causing millions in damages. The initial incident occurred at the Union Munitions Company plant in the Andieburg area, destroying fourteen of the fifteen factory buildings and killing at least ten people. Shortly thereafter, an explosion was heard at the American Celerite Company munitions factory in the Woodbridge area. Before long, the Trojan Powder Company factory outside of Allentown, New Jersey, also experienced an explosion. Investigators from Washington have immediately dispatched personnel to begin an investigation. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>Southern Ireland Rejects Cooperation with Britain; Canada to Intervene; Lease Naval and Air Force Ports</h3>
<p>Ottawa – Conservative Party leader of the Canadian House of Commons, Mr. Hanson, spoke yesterday about the Southern Irish government’s refusal to allow Britain to use its naval bases and air force ports, stating that the Canadian government should make a private request to Southern Irish Prime Minister de Valera to lease the two ports on Southern Ireland’s west coast to Canada as its naval stations during wartime. Southern Ireland’s refusal to allow Britain to use its ports is one of the greatest dangers to the British war effort and a valuable contribution to the Axis powers. The Southern Irish government is clearly unwilling to change its policy of non-cooperation with Britain merely at the request of the British government. This situation must be addressed. Canada should intervene with Southern Ireland, not only to lease its two ports on the west coast but also to lease its southwestern air force ports as Canadian air force stations. Canada might seek assistance from the United States in this matter, as many Americans are quite supportive of Southern Ireland’s freedom. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Ottawa – The situation of Canadian citizens is quite similar to that of the United States, as the population of Canada is composed of people of various nationalities. Although Canada is home to people of various nationalities, the main cultural division is between French Canadians and British Canadians. One notable characteristic is that French Canadians do not have a particular allegiance to France. In fact, these French Canadians tend to downplay French liberalism in politics, religion, and the arts. They are not concerned about France’s failures, but are worried about the impact of France’s failures on Britain. Currently, both British and French Canadians are working towards national unity.

<h3>National Foreign Trade Deficit Exceeds 100 Million Yuan This Year; Free Areas Have Trade Surplus of Over 80 Million Yuan; Deficit Caused by Excessive Imports into Occupied Areas</h3>
<p>Chongqing – According to an announcement by the authorities, from January 1 to September 30 of this year, the total value of exports from the Chinese free areas was 120,529,000 yuan, and the total value of imports was 35,292,000 yuan, resulting in a surplus of 85,247,000 yuan. During the closure of the Yunnan-Burma Road, exports continued as usual, while imports will only resume after the road reopens. This is one of the reasons for the surplus. During this period, the total value of imports in trade between the free areas and the occupied areas was 1,558,606,000 yuan, and exports were 1,447,521,000 yuan, resulting in a deficit of 111,085,000 yuan. In terms of total trade volume, Shanghai ranks first, with imports of 615,197,000 yuan and exports of 984,192,000 yuan. Tianjin is second, with imports of 490,279,000 yuan and exports of 105,391,000 yuan. In terms of the origin of imports, Japanese goods rank first, totaling 336,840,000 yuan, accounting for 23.54% of total imports. However, the sales locations for these imported Japanese goods are limited to the occupied areas. The United States ranks second, totaling 334,189,000 yuan, accounting for 21.44% of total imports. In terms of Chinese goods exported to various countries, the United States ranks first, totaling 414,404,000 yuan, accounting for 28.63% of total Chinese exports. This is up from only 122,666,000 yuan during the same period last year. Chinese goods exported through Hong Kong totaled 287,508,000 yuan. In addition, trade is developing rapidly in Mengzi in Yunnan and Ningbo in Zhejiang. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>Actual Direct Tax Revenue Exceeds Budget</h3>
<p>Chongqing – According to an announcement by the authorities, the original budget for direct taxes for the entire year was 75,240,000 yuan, but by the end of October, it had already reached 76,402,857.84 yuan. It is estimated that the total tax revenue for the end of the year will be between 85,000,000 yuan and 100,000,000 yuan. The main reason is the prosperity of businesses and the expansion of tax areas. (Havas, 13th)</p>

At 7:00 PM, the German government hosted a banquet at the "Kaiserhof Hotel" to welcome Molotov and his entourage. (Haitong News, 13th)</p>
<p>Berlin – The contents of the two and a half hour meeting between Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissar Molotov and Hitler yesterday remain shrouded in secrecy. Neither the German officialdom nor the government-controlled press have announced any details or expressed any opinions. Some believe that the subject of yesterday's and today's continued negotiations involves dividing the spheres of influence among Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, Japan, and Spain. The outline of this division was previously roughly defined in the alliance of the three countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan. German officials stated today that all parties concerned believe that it is imperative to clearly delineate their relationships with each other, and this is what the current negotiations are seeking. Therefore, the issues discussed at the meeting not only include Europe but also Asia and Africa, and their nature is said to be largely political rather than economic. (Associated Press, 13th)</p>
<p>German Foreign Ministry Issues Statement Explaining Purpose of German-Soviet Talks</p>
<p>London – According to French radio, the German Foreign Ministry sent an official statement to journalists yesterday, stating that Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov's visit to Berlin is the logical result of the development of the European situation and the signing of the Tripartite Pact. The development of the war and the German-Italian-Japanese alliance have created a new situation, and it is necessary to clearly define the Soviet Union's position. Molotov's visit has two purposes: (1) to determine the basis for political and economic coordination between the Soviet Union and the Axis powers and in the future with Japan; (2) to reconsider the basis of the German-Soviet agreement from the perspective of broader coordination. In the current environment, Mr. Molotov's visit is meaningful because it proves that the development of Europe and the signing of the Tripartite Pact have not affected the complete realization of the common interests of both the United States and Germany. Since the establishment of the German-Soviet agreement, coordination between the two sides has become increasingly close and has never faltered, contrary to foreign propaganda. The talks are not an end in themselves, but an important stage in a completely and permanently coordinated relationship between the two countries. French radio continued that after Molotov returns to his country, major talks will be held in Moscow to continue the discussions in Berlin. Moscow political circles say that after Molotov reports the situation to Stalin, he will discuss everything with the Japanese and German ambassadors to the Soviet Union, and major contacts will also be made with the representatives of Italy and Turkey in the Soviet Union.

<p>Rumor That Germany and the Soviet Union Are Preparing a Plan to Put Pressure on Turkey</p>
<p>London – According to political observers here, the main reason why the Soviet Union sent Foreign Commissar Molotov with a mission to Berlin is that the Soviet Union is apprehensive of Germany and fears that it will not get a share of the spoils when the Balkans are divided. One of the results that may be obtained from Molotov's discussions in Germany is the formulation of a plan to increase pressure on Turkey and force Turkey to make concessions to Germany. After Molotov arrived in Berlin yesterday, Hitler immediately received him and held discussions for two hours, with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop also present. However, the nature of the talks has not yet been disclosed. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Budapest – It is widely rumored in diplomatic circles here in Hungary that Germany and the Soviet Union are negotiating a plan to jointly launch a blitzkrieg against Turkey. Rumor has it that the result of the meeting between Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and Hitler in Berlin is that the two sides agreed that the Soviet Union would demand two locations from Turkey: the Turkish border in the Kars region and a fleet base in the Dardanelles. (International News Service, 13th)</p>
<p>Berlin Creates Ominous Facts; Londoners Feel Extremely Uneasy</p>
<p>London – People here in London today are deeply uneasy about the talks between Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and German leader Hitler and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. British politicians, who previously recognized German-Soviet intimacy as another pose, now share the same view as the majority and recognize that Germany and the Soviet Union are once again creating ominous historical facts. People here are worried that the results of the German-Soviet talks may lead to the following facts: (1) The non-belligerent Soviet Union may become closer to Germany, Italy, and Japan; (2) Contrary to the current Axis concept, the Soviet Union may partially abandon China and conclude a pact with Japan; (3) The fate of Turkey and the Dardanelles is about to enter a critical stage. British people are also increasingly worried about the lack of accurate information regarding the results of Molotov's talks. According to political circles here, British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Cripps went to the Soviet Foreign Ministry on Monday to inquire about the meaning of Molotov's trip to Germany, but Soviet Deputy Foreign Commissar Vishinsky consistently refused to tell him. (Associated Press, 13th)</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Will Not Get Involved in the War; The Axis Powers' Plans Will Ultimately Fail</p>
<p>London – Criticism of Molotov's visit to Berlin has been issued under the authorization of the Axis powers, especially from Rome. All of them express the extravagant hope that this discussion will allow the Soviet Union to expand its power to influence Turkish policy to benefit the Axis powers' plans. Observers in London believe that there is no good reason for the Soviet Union's recent policies to make this hope come true. The leaders of the Red Army recently reiterated Stalin's intention during a major review to uphold the policy of ensuring that the Soviet people do not participate in the war. As for the Turkish government's attitude, the Turkish newspaper "Hakimiyet" has published detailed comments on British-Turkish friendship in the past few days, which British people find very satisfactory. The newspaper said that the world may find it strange that the two countries that opposed each other in the last war now have a deep and sincere friendship. The reason is very simple: Turkey's only wish is to develop its own resources within its own territory, and Britain also wants all countries to develop their resources peacefully. Britain's belief in this concept can be proven by its emphasis on the League of Nations. Britain's repeated tolerance of Hitler's insatiable demands for the sake of European peace is another proof of Britain's belief in this concept. Britain firmly recognizes that individual freedom, honor, and democracy are the only way to progress and civilization. The Turkish way of thinking has been adopted by Turkey, so the two countries share the same ideas and principles. British friendship is stronger than any combination of Nazis and Fascists, unlike Nazism and Fascism, which are only combined to divide Europe. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Japan Hopes Germany Will Act as a Mediator to Promote Rapprochement Between the Soviet Union and Japan</p>
<p>Tokyo – According to semi-official Japanese sources, the Japanese newspaper "Miyako Shimbun" commented on Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's visit to Berlin, saying that it is time for Japan and the Soviet Union to "adjust their mutual relations to achieve the greater goal of a new world order." It is expected that the result of Molotov's trip will be the stabilization of Soviet-German relations, and will also have a good psychological impact on "the rapid realization of Soviet-Japanese rapprochement." (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Moscow – Since the announcement here that the Japanese diplomatic envoy to Moscow, Mr. Nishi, had accompanied Molotov to Berlin, the rumor that the Soviet Union and Japan would sign a non-aggression pact in Berlin has gradually gained momentum today. Although the authorities in Berlin and here continue to maintain silence, some parties believe that things are moving in this direction. People here recall that in September of this year, the Axis powers kept their alliance with Japan a secret, so it is possible that Germany will once again drop another bombshell on the political world and suddenly announce the rapprochement between Moscow and Tokyo. Observers also believe that the secret agreement of the German-Italian-Japanese alliance is said to have stipulated that Germany should do its best to bring the Soviet Union and Japan closer together. If these ten results can be promoted with all efforts, then Germany will definitely be willing to participate. In addition, some parties also believe that the two-hour talk between U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew and Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke on Sunday is very important, as Grew also visited the Japanese Foreign Minister for a meeting of the same nature before Japan joined the Axis alliance in mid-September.

The attendance of Dr. Hallbach and Dr. Schmelzer, General Manager of the German Chemical Trust, is believed to indicate that the issue of German-Soviet barter trade will also be discussed in these negotiations. Other distinguished guests included the famous sculptor Professor Bulik and the stage design expert Professor Arieth. (Haitong News, 13th)</p>

<h3>Concentration of Italian Forces, Preparing for a Counterattack Against Greek Troops, Fierce Battles in Progress Around Korçë, Italian Aircraft and Artillery Bombard Greek Positions Fiercely</h3>
<p>Athens, last night, Italy rushed reinforcements to the Korçë area for a large-scale counterattack, intending to halt the rapid advances of the Greek troops on all fronts. According to the London Daily Express correspondent in Athens, the Italian commander added elite reinforcements and dive bombers to the battle, aiming to break through the Greek positions at all costs. Fierce battles are now underway around Korçë. Yesterday, Italian heavy artillery bombarded Greek positions all day in preparation for a large-scale offensive. It is expected that the Italian offensive may begin within a day or two. Although the Italian artillery continuously bombarded and the air force repeatedly attacked, the initiative seemed to remain with the Greek troops. The British Air Force has provided substantial assistance to the Greek troops. It is reported that British bombers again raided Italian bases yesterday. It is learned that the Italian troops tasted their own artillery fire for the first time yesterday, as the Greek troops used a large number of captured weapons to attack the Italian troops. While the Greek troops pursued the Italian troops in the deep valleys of the central Pindus Mountains, they used the captured light artillery and machine guns to bombard them. It is generally believed that the new offensive of the concentrated Italian forces has been ordered by General Soddu, the Italian Army Chief and Commander-in-Chief of the Italian forces attacking Greece, and has already been implemented. (International News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>Belgrade, according to news from near the Greek border in southern countries, the concentration of Italian troops in northern Greece has not yet been completed. Italian motorized units are arriving from southern Albania, indicating that the large-scale Italian offensive will not begin for several days. The current fighting is only its prelude. (Haitong News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>Athens, recent war reports from the Greek front stated that reinforcements of Italian shock troops launched fierce attacks in the area north of Korçë, fighting desperately to prevent the Greek advance. However, the Greek side is determined to advance along the entire front according to the original plan. Italian dive bombers fiercely attacked Greek positions yesterday, which is believed to be a prelude. Within a day or two, Italian forces in various areas are expected to launch larger offensives. The Greek High Command announced today that British and Greek aircraft again attacked Italian bases in Albania, including Korçë, Elbasan, and Vlorë. According to frontline reports, large numbers of Italian reinforcements have arrived in Sandi and Nérantza, apparently preparing for a new offensive. These reinforcements are believed to be natives of the Alps. (International News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>Rome, this afternoon's Italian military report stated that there were only reconnaissance activities and artillery duels in the Korçë area. The enemy's attempt to attack our army's positions in Epirus was unsuccessful. Our army bombed enemy positions in Pindus, Kalpaki, and Filiates. (Haitong News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>Greek Warriors Capture Gangani with Heroic Vigor Like Stroke Victims</p>
<p>Ohrid, according to unconfirmed reports from the border, Greek warriors, heroic and vigorous like stroke victims, completely defeated the Italian counterattack on the right wing of Korçë yesterday. The Italian force, one division strong, is now retreating towards the Albanian border. In this battle, the Italian side suffered 12 officers and 630 soldiers killed. The Italian troops abandoned a large amount of baggage during their retreat. According to another report, the Greek troops in the battle zone along the Bikrista-Korçë highway captured Gangani yesterday. The Italian troops retreated to Poliana, eight kilometers from Korçë. In the battle of Gangani, the Greek army suffered 26 deaths and 70 injuries, and captured 7 officers and 140 soldiers. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<p>Italian Troops in the Pindus Mountain Pocket Retreat in Utter Confusion</p>
<p>Athens, the Reuters correspondent with the Greek forces reports that British bomber squadrons again bombed targets within Albania yesterday. Albanian ports used by the Italian army as supply bases were also bombed, but the results are not yet known. The large amount of war equipment abandoned by the Italian army in the gorges of central Epirus is still being collected by the Greek forces. Military circles here believe that the rout of four to five thousand Italian troops in the Pindus pocket area is a major Greek victory. These Italian soldiers abandoned their weapons while fleeing, exhausted and hungry, in utter confusion. The Greek forces also bombed and destroyed mountain rocks at high altitudes in the gorges, and the falling rocks severely struck the fleeing Italian soldiers. Their panicked and confused state will greatly shake the morale of the Italian reinforcements. Furthermore, hundreds of Italian soldiers' corpses are floating in the Shushica River, drifting from the Pindus Mountains into the Albanian watershed, increasing the terror of the Italian reinforcements, who may not have the courage to attack the stronger Greek defenses than before.

<p>Greek Prime Minister Announces Completion of Mobilization, British Air Force Attacks Albanian Seaport</p>

<p>Athens, a British Air Force communiqué recently stated that a squadron of British bombers completely destroyed the important Albanian seaport and fuel depot in Durrës on Monday night and Tuesday morning. Three large fires broke out after the docks were bombed. Subsequently, the fires spread, and the three large fires merged into one. The British airmen, while flying back, could still see the blazing fire from a distance of one hundred miles. According to the British airman leading the bombing of Durrës, speaking to a United Press reporter, this was the best result of the squadron's air raids since the beginning of the war. The fuel depot was destroyed first, and then the entire city and port were engulfed in flames due to the bombing. The airman continued, "I started the operation after the fire broke out, first dropping the first bomb on the burning area, and then dropping the remaining bombs to complete the destruction. I also dropped several bombs on the prosperous port area, and the losses and chaos must have been enormous. "The British Air Force communiqué also stated that another squadron of aircraft also raided an ammunition depot in Vlorë, Albania, at night. The docks of Vlorë were attacked repeatedly yesterday, and large bombs were dropped on the center of the docks and large buildings. Vlorë fired fierce anti-aircraft fire, but it was ineffective. All British aircraft returned safely. (United Press, 13th)</p>

<h3>A Painful History of War (3): Three Tragic Protagonists in the French Tragedy (1): Édouard Daladier, Strong in Appearance but Weak Inside</h3>
<p>Jules Romains, a first-class French writer, is well-known and associates with many high-ranking officials. Before this European war broke out, he was commissioned by the authorities to travel to various countries to conduct secret diplomatic activities, intending to prevent the war from taking shape. Unfortunately, his efforts were unsuccessful, and he returned empty-handed. Witnessing the fall of his homeland and the turmoil of the world, he went to the United States, unable to bear the feeling of melancholy. He then wrote about his past visits to the heads of state in various European countries, each with a different face, many of which are unimaginable to outsiders. His collection is rich, and his writing is tortuous, making it an invaluable and important historical anecdote of modern history. Regarding the French part, there are personality analyses of former Prime Minister Daladier and Allied Commander-in-Chief General Gamelin, which are both laughable and tearful. The translations are as follows:</p>
<p>Jules Romains' acquaintance with Daladier dates back to the spring of 1926. At that time, Jules Romains' play about a dictator was being previewed at the Comédie-Française and was well received by the audience. Daladier was one of them and strongly guaranteed that if there were any repercussions when the play was performed publicly, he alone would be willing to take all responsibility. At that time, France was in a "time of peace," and people from top to bottom were happy and comfortable. Many of the ruling elders and members of Congress in the French government were involved in affairs with actresses and young women. Daladier was the Minister of Education at the time. On the day he summoned Jules Romains for a conversation, when discussing such scandalous affairs, Daladier said with a smile, "To be honest, I have never had any dealings with the young women in the theater. As Minister of Education, I can proudly say that I am innocent."</p>
<p>Jules Romains' impression of Daladier can be seen in the following words: "Afterwards, I thought, this is really the person we need. Soon, I thought again, maybe he is the one we are hoping for, the one we absolutely cannot do without. I must keep a close watch on him."</p>
<p>A few months later, Daladier was elected as the president of the Radical-Socialist Party. In the following years, he repeatedly held important positions, held great power, and was highly expected by all sides. Who knew that after the riots in Paris on February 6, 1934, he could not withstand some minor disturbances and dissolved the cabinet the next day? That night, there was a great commotion in Paris. Vehicles were blocked, shops were robbed, and the police turned a blind eye. The workers were full of anger and shouted, "Sentence the chief culprit Daladier to the extreme penalty!" Daladier's indecisive shortcomings were fully exposed at this point.</p>
<p>Two years later, in May 1936, the Popular Front cabinet was established, and Daladier was also elected as one of the leaders. Although his position was not very important, he gradually regained the power he had lost. During this period, Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy gradually colluded, and the situation in Europe became darker day by day. Daladier took office as Minister of War at this time. This gave Daladier another opportunity to act. All parties hoped that he could proceed step by step, reorganize the military, and train the troops well, first and foremost not being used by the warlords. Everyone believed that he would be able to achieve great things this time and not repeat the mistakes of February 6th.</p>
<p>The mysterious color of Daladier, as conveyed in Jules Romains' writing, is now revealed before us. He said:</p>
<p>In April 1938, Daladier served as Prime Minister and Minister of War. Bonnet succeeded Delbos as Minister of Foreign Affairs. I (the author refers to himself, the same below) often interacted with Bonnet, just like before with Delbos, and it was nothing more than wanting to find a way to peace and prevent the outbreak of war. At that time, I traveled around Europe, visiting fourteen countries, motivated by the desire to secretly consult with important figures in various European countries, such as politicians, dignitaries, and social leaders, to unite several free countries or partially unsuppressed countries to jointly maintain European peace.</p>
<p>When I talked to Bonnet, I often asked him, "Did you tell Daladier about my actions? What is his opinion?" At that time, many French people did not understand Bonnet very well, but I always felt that he was worthy of praise. My conversations with him were not superficial, and there were always results after each conversation. Generally speaking, although I did not encourage him to tell Daladier what we talked about, I knew for sure that Bonnet told him what we talked about at any time.</p>
<p>One day in early November of that year, Bonnet came to me with a worried face and said, "The Prime Minister is in an unusually bad mood." This was just a month after the Munich Conference. When Daladier had just returned from Munich, he felt that he had done his best, but he always felt uneasy in his heart. He thought that when he returned to Paris, he would inevitably be ridiculed by the citizens, but unexpectedly, they gave him a very warm welcome. Soon, everyone's opinion changed, and they suspected that Daladier had inevitably sold out completely in Munich. When Hitler gave a speech in Saarbrücken, everyone felt like they had been splashed with a bucket of water. Conspirators were eyeing the opportunity and moving. The Communists received orders from Moscow to disrupt the cabinet led by Daladier and Bonnet, thinking it was a punishment for the failure of Munich. They started very cleverly and maliciously, stirring up trouble among the working class. (Until a year later, when the war broke out, there was still unrest among the workers.)</p>
<p>Bonnet continued, "Yes, Daladier is very clear about it. He feels that there are people around him who want to harm him, but he doesn't know that he actually holds a pivotal position among the key figures in the center. As long as he can cheer up a little, he can sweep away the conspirators and silence the Communists. Unfortunately, he is somewhat like an Adou who cannot be helped up. If he falls again, everything will be lost."</p>
<p>At that time, the French had long forgotten his overthrow on February 7, 1934. Everyone was now placing great hope on him, thinking that in the critical moment of France's survival, he would be a true hero in political history, or at least, the times would create a hero, and he was the only one who could do it.</p>
<p>If Daladier was uneasy in his position at this time, there would be turmoil on the political stage, and there would also be chaos in the streets and factories. Once the seeds of disaster were sown, external problems would follow in a few weeks.</p>
<p>Bonnet said to me, "Please, you must visit Daladier and have a long talk with him. The words we have spoken to him to support him have had little effect so far. We can only rely on your great strength to encourage him and help him to stabilize his mind. Please go quickly."</p>
<p>I considered it again and again, and remembered the small note I sent him on the evening of January 6 (On February 6, 1934, riots broke out in Paris, and that night the author wrote a note to Daladier, urging him to persevere to the end and not give in easily. But the result was the opposite, and Daladier ended up leaving the cabinet), and couldn't help but laugh. But I still replied to Bonnet, "Okay, it doesn't hurt to try, but I can't guarantee that it will be effective after the conversation. You still need to assist from the side. I'll write him a sincere letter first, and leave the visit for after the letter. I hope that this letter will be effective immediately, and after another conversation, things should go smoothly."</p>
<p>Bonnet said, "That's a good idea. Please write the letter quickly, and I will take it myself, so that it will not be seen by others."</p>
<p>We then thought about the people around Daladier, and felt that they were not impossible to work with, but it was a pity that Daladier was surrounded by them, as if he was cut off from the world.</p>
<p>On November 4th, I gave Bonnet a letter, which he immediately delivered to Daladier. The letter was worded as follows:</p>
<p>"Dear Prime Minister, I humbly present this letter in the spirit of saying everything I know and saying it all, as a humble offering. I earnestly hope that you will deeply consider the two aspects of responsibility and power at this time. Within a few days, you can still save France and the current government from danger. Otherwise, the final fate is at hand, and I need not waste any more words. Someone as intelligent as you will know the details very well.</p>
<p>Your reputation is known far and wide, and the facts are obvious. It is a pity that you yourself do not seem to value it. Apart from you, all the officials are often frightened and at a loss when faced with danger, fooling themselves and others. You are experienced in national planning, thoughtful and thorough, and resist all kinds of relentless accusations with unwavering will. All of this, morally speaking, is due to your credible reputation and is what we admire. But as of today, what you should overcome is also this.</p>
<p>You should cherish your reputation, otherwise it will be lost in the blink of an eye, as the saying goes. Today, France has everything to offer, and you can take it all, but only for the sake of the country, and nothing else matters. However, time is of the essence, and the disposal must be thorough. If there is even the slightest mistake, France will return to political division and chaos. If this were to happen, no one in the government or the opposition would be able to fight for the motherland, because this crisis is unprecedented in the history of France.</p>
<p>At present, you are the only one who can bring the people to safety. There are many factors, too numerous to list. And some of them are rare and difficult to obtain. We are willing to follow in your footsteps, and you should also follow the will of the people. With your qualities, in this environment, you cannot be aloof. There is no one else to turn to. I sincerely hope that you will act with sincerity and complete the heavy task with internal motivation. Because if not, tragedy will come quickly.</p>
<p>If you can persevere to the end, you can be sure of final victory. Even if you fail, you can have a clear conscience before conscience and history. If you are just perfunctory, dare not offend anyone in everything, or are too cautious, worrying too much, and missing the opportunity, then failure cannot be avoided. By the time the situation is irreversible, it will be too late to regret.</p>
<p>In short, success or failure has reached the final moment, and you alone must choose and decide. If I did not speak in a serious tone, I would not be able to see the urgency of this period. Now is not the time for politicians to play tricks. You are responsible for completing the great and heroic cause. As for how to do it, you can decide for yourself.</p>
<p>You don't need to seek help from others. Consulting advisors is useless, and even senior officials and veterans will not help. These people are old and weak, ignorant and senile, and cannot keep up with the times. If you adopt their seemingly correct but actually wrong proposals, it will lead to the destruction of the country. And these corrupt elements will sigh and flee to the United States, publishing their grand theories in various magazines in their 'it's all my fault' tone.</p>
<p>I respectfully urge you to take your own views as your own, and only listen to your own words. Deep in your heart, you should know that you are a republican citizen, a democratic citizen, and a son of the nation. You should sincerely save the fate of France, and not just serve France with words. If you can accept my humble advice, you will make a great contribution and add new value to the world's democratic politics. Jules Romains"</p>
<p>At the end of the letter, I added a sentence, telling him that I was going to England that evening and was scheduled to return to France on the 11th. On the day I returned, Daladier immediately summoned me for a conversation. I stepped into his official residence on Rue Saint-Dominique and saw that he was as elegant as I had seen him in the spring of 1926. His face was slightly fuller than before, and he looked even more rosy and substantial. His eyes showed a slight weariness amid their kindness, but his gaze was still very sharp, and the tone of his conversation was the same as before. As soon as he saw me, he immediately reached out his hands.</p>
<p>"Jules Romains, your letter has been very beneficial to me."</p>
<p>We talked casually, and everyone was frank and selfless. We talked about all the dangerous situations at home and abroad. I informed him of the impressions and news I had obtained in England, and what I said was in line with the views in my letter. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Another Victory for the British Air Force: Seven Italian Ships Destroyed, Three of Six Italian Battleships Eliminated; British Prime Minister Reports to the House with Great Excitement</h3>
<p>London – According to today’s Admiralty communique, aircraft from the British Naval Air Arm attacked the Italian fleet at its main base in Taranto on the evening of November 11th. It has now been confirmed that three of the six Italian battleships, as well as two cruisers and two auxiliary ships, were destroyed. The Italian battleship fleet has a total strength of six battleships, including two recently added Littorio-class ships and four recently modernized Cavour-class ships. The Littorio-class battleships displace 35,000 tons each and are the most modern warships in the Italian navy, having joined the fleet in Genoa in May of this year. Their armament includes nine 15-inch guns, twenty-four other guns of various sizes, and forty anti-aircraft machine guns. They have a speed of 30 knots per hour, carry three aircraft, and have a total crew of 1,600 men. The four Cavour-class battleships have recently been modernized and displace 31,000 tons each, equipped with ten 12.6-inch guns and other armaments, including thirty-nine anti-aircraft machine guns, four aircraft each, and a total crew of 1,100 men. It has been determined that one Littorio-class ship and two Cavour-class ships were destroyed by British aircraft. Therefore, only three Italian battleships are currently operational. Two aircraft did not return. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>London – Today, when Prime Minister Churchill announced the overwhelming victory of the Naval Air Arm's bombing of the Italian fleet in Taranto in the House of Commons, the House cheered for several minutes. When the Prime Minister mentioned the destruction of a Littorio-class battleship, he explained that this type of warship was very powerful and that the Italian fleet was numerically stronger than the British Mediterranean Fleet. However, for some reason, they resolutely refused to engage in combat. The Prime Minister also stated that the British Naval Air Arm's action was a glorious continuation of the war and that only three Italian battleships remain operational. This result not only affects the balance of naval power in the Mediterranean but also reverberates in naval situations around the world. (Reuters, 13th)</p>

<h3>German Warship Attacks British Convoy in the Atlantic: One-Quarter Escapes from Thirty-Eight Ships; HMS Jervis Bay Fights Bravely, Catches Fire, and Sinks</h3>
<p>London – The British armed merchant cruiser HMS Jervis Bay (14,000 tons) left the convoy to attack a German warship in the Atlantic. Although the Jervis Bay was hit by the German warship, caught fire, and sank, its guns continued to roar. Therefore, most of the ships in the convoy were able to scatter and escape in the fading light. This is the same convoy that the German command claimed to have annihilated. Two ships have safely arrived in a Scottish port. The British Admiralty communiqué describing this glorious maritime event stated that a British convoy of thirty-eight ships was attacked by an enemy warship on the night of the 5th of this month. Except for nine ships, the rest had already escaped safely. It is possible that several of the missing British ships are safe. Although this large convoy encountered a powerful enemy attacker, the fact that three-quarters of the ships were spared destruction was due to the skillful dispersal of the merchant ship captains, the use of smoke screens, and the bravery of the escorting HMS Jervis Bay. The details are not yet fully known. It is only known that HMS Jervis Bay approached the enemy warship and engaged it with weapons of vastly different firepower, allowing most of the convoy ships to scatter and escape. HMS Jervis Bay was hit by many shells and was engulfed in flames, but continued to fire its guns. Two hours later, the ship exploded, and the hull was almost completely lost. Sixty-five members of the crew of the ship escaped and were rescued by a merchant ship. Twenty ships that escaped from the convoy have now arrived in port. According to eyewitnesses to the battle, the attacking warship fired several shots at first, and HMS Jervis Bay was hit and badly damaged. It quickly caught fire and gradually sank, with seawater washing over the deck, but it continued to fire its guns. The enemy warship fired at intervals of five shots, and the shells were accurate. At that time, the enemy warship was eight miles away, and it was estimated that its guns were 11-inch caliber. HMS Jervis Bay fought very bravely, first leaving the convoy to meet the attack, while the other ships were ordered to disperse as dusk fell. The crew of HMS Jervis Bay must have known that their fate was in grave danger, but they still did their best to continue bombarding the German warship with more guns and greater firepower, maintaining their glorious tradition until they caught fire and sank. The sound of gunfire was still heard as other ships fled to safety. The fact that the crews of the other ships were able to preserve their lives was due to the heroic actions of HMS Jervis Bay. It is said that the convoy was carrying food and materials back to Britain, and the largest ship was the Rangitiki. The captain of HMS Jervis Bay, Fegan, served as the captain of the British cruiser HMS Suffolk stationed in China several years ago. On one occasion, he bravely led his men to rescue the crew of a ship that had run aground between southern China and the Philippines, for which he received special commendation. HMS Jervis Bay was normally an Australian mail ship, with a total of fifteen senior officers and one hundred and seventy-four ordinary crew members. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>British Convoy Attacked in North Sea: Several German Aircraft Shot Down</h3>

Last night, German broadcasts claimed that German aircraft had sunk five British ships totaling 37,000 tons in this attack on the convoy. Later, a German military headquarters communiqué also claimed to have sunk seven British merchant ships totaling 44,000 tons. However, both of these claims are false. In fact, no ships were sunk. Only two ships were slightly damaged, but they are now all safe. (Reuters, 13th)</p>

<h3>Pétain Explains Reform Plan: Divides France into Twenty Administrative Regions, Strengthens Government Authority</h3>
<p>Clermont-Ferrand, France – Marshal Pétain met with a reporter from "Floral Weekly" today and gave a speech explaining the government's reasons for reforming administrative institutions. He said, in summary, that since the great revolution of the 18th century, our country's local administration has divided the country into eighty-six provinces, each with a governor in charge of all administrative matters. This reform's main goal is to strengthen government authority. The government, based on geographical and political conditions, will divide the country into twenty administrative regions, each region including three, four, or five provinces. The affairs of each region will be managed by an administrative commissioner. The administrative commissioner will have jurisdiction over the governors of the provinces under his jurisdiction and will be directly controlled by the central government. Thereafter, the functions of the provincial governors will be purely administrative rather than political. We are now building this administrative structure to restore order and vitality. Everything will be ready and put into practice. All citizens should contribute to helping me, with one heart and one mind, to revive the motherland. (Havas, 12th)</p>

<h3>Recent Developments of the China Economic Reconstruction Association</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) The China Economic Reconstruction Association was established in April 1939. The association is divided into eight groups: Transportation, Industry, Mining, Agriculture, Water Conservancy, Public Utilities, Construction, and Economics. The main purpose is to unite experts in various departments in the country to study the overall plan for China's economic reconstruction in the future. In the first joint meeting of the groups, an economic construction plan has been drafted, which must be based on the central government's overall economic policy. At present, each group will first draft a policy based on the Principle of People's Livelihood, the Industrial Plan, and the central government's Anti-Japanese Construction Outline, and fully exchange opinions with the Economics Group. After that, the draft economic policy will be compiled, and then the China Economic Construction Plan will be drafted based on it. In order to facilitate the work, the Economic Policy Research Committee and the Economic Construction Plan Editorial Committee will be established at the same time. In addition to the directors of each group naturally participating in the selection of committee members, a few people will be selected and hired from the members to jointly draft policies and plans with each group. The association will comprehensively study and edit them. In order to gather ideas and solicit opinions from all parties, the association will first list general problems, and then list them into eight departmental problems according to the group, and compile them into trial questions. Members are requested to carefully review and provide opinions on the overall standing injuries of post-war economic construction. The association will then compile them into a collection of problems, which are divided into outlines and nine categories of transportation, industry, mining, agriculture, water conservancy, public utilities, construction, trade, administration and finance. Each category includes six items: policy, plan, system, personnel, capital, and materials, followed by other categories, including questions that do not belong to the above categories. It has been distributed to all members, asking them to provide answers, which will be compiled by the two committees after being sorted out by each group. The first draft has been completed and will be published.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council's Economic Committee Recommends Expanding the Library</h3>
<p>Given the breadth of Shanghai and the density of its population, the library must be extensively expanded and improved in order to display its value. However, since the expansion requires a large amount of funds, the Special Economic Committee of the Municipal Council, although wanting to recommend expansion, did not do so in the end. However, the committee has recommended that the library's book purchase budget for the next year be increased from 20,000 yuan to 40,000 yuan, and more non-fiction books should be added. At the same time, Japanese magazines and scientific publications should also be purchased.</p>
<p>In recent years, the library's work has become increasingly developed, and the original staff is insufficient to allocate. A deputy director and an assistant should be hired immediately, and a servant should be hired. The definite salary scale for each staff member is currently lacking and should be formulated by the bureau. Due to the income from book subscriptions, this year's estimate is only 8,700 yuan. This association advocates that the subscription fee for books should be increased by 50% thereafter to increase income. Also, one-third of the subscribers are residents of the French Concession. The Municipal Council should send a letter to the French Municipal Council to allocate subsidies to assist.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Provincial Government Establishes Advanced Leather Manufacturing Vocational School: Hires Leather Manufacturing Expert Zhang Quan as Factory Director to Cultivate Leather Manufacturing Talents for National Use</h3>
<p>(Chengdu Aviation News) The leather manufacturing industry is one of the four major light industries, along with the dyeing and weaving industry, the cotton textile industry, and the rubber manufacturing industry. Its raw material consumption is second only to cotton textiles. Therefore, European and American countries attach great importance to it and have established special schools to improve technology. China has a vast territory and abundant products, and the production of cattle and sheepskins is very abundant. Sichuan sheepskin is famous all over the world. Unfortunately, there are no good leather factories to refine it, so it is mostly sold abroad. Foreigners refine it into finished goods and resell it to Chinese people. The loss is very obvious. Now, the provincial government, in view of this, in order to promote the development of the leather manufacturing industry in this province, improve raw materials and technology, and further improve the leather manufacturing industry in the country, imitates Europe and the United States to establish an advanced leather manufacturing vocational school to cultivate leather manufacturing talents for national use. The contents of this school are briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>Selection of School Site In 1937, the Sichuan Construction and Education Bureaus subsidized the Chemistry Department of the College of Science of West China University with 9,000 yuan to build two experimental leather factories for the purpose of improving the leather in this province. At that time, due to limited funding, the equipment was not perfect. Therefore, in the spring of this year, another 30,000 yuan was subsidized as a purchase of machinery and start-up expenses, which was managed by a committee composed of three organs, and leather expert Zhang Quan was hired as the factory director. In order to facilitate the students of this school to practice, the school site is temporarily located in Huaxi New Village. After the permanent school site is determined, it will be built.</p>
<p>Existing Equipment in the Factory One spraying machine, one bark tanning machine, one dyeing drum, one leather rolling and polishing machine, one leather kneading wheel, and one trough. The above items can be installed within next month. In addition, there are twenty-four lemon tanks, six lemon immersion tanks, two large gray pools (and various utensils, other such as water towers, grinders, polishing machines, etc., are being purchased and built.</p>
<p>Curriculum Distribution First year of high school: chemistry, physics, biology, mathematics, English, Chinese, civics, physical education. Second year: elementary leather manufacturing, qualitative analysis, quantitative analysis, organic chemistry, leather manufacturing preparation engineering, English, Chinese, mathematics, bacteriology, histology. Third year: inorganic tanning method, organic tanning method, fur tanning and dyeing method, elementary theoretical chemistry, leather analysis, factory management, factory design.</p>
<p>Equipment The overview of the industry is as described above. Other chemical, physical, and biological instruments are difficult to purchase at present. They will be temporarily borrowed from West China University and equipped in stages in the future.</p>
<p>Teaching Methods In order to achieve the harmony between "learning" and "use", equal emphasis is placed on theory and factory training. All scholars are students in the classroom, and apprentices in the factory. Everything must be done by themselves to cultivate the habit of enduring hardship and hard work. Students must have the knowledge of leather manufacturers and the experience of workers after graduation.</p>
<p>The curriculum of this school is numerous and the management is strict. Students who have no industrial interest, cannot endure hardship and hard work, and cannot strictly abide by school rules, please do not apply.</p>
<h3>Hebei Provincial Xingtai Normal School Decides to Re-establish in Leiyang: Temporarily Establishes a Special Normal Science Department</h3>
<p>Leiyang Newsletter: Since the July 7th War, the enemy has approached Xingtai, and the environment is harsh. The school affairs of Hebei Provincial Xingtai Normal School cannot be carried out. The school leaders Zang Zhenlv, Zhang Yanyu, Li Shangjing Zhao Shuicheng, etc., in order to implement emergency measures, will divide the school's books, physics instruments, pianos, etc. into more than seventy boxes, first transported to Xuchang, Henan, and then transferred to Hankou, Changsha, and finally to Guilin. Now that the war has been won and the foundation is solid, and most of the students of the original school have moved to Hunan and wandered in other places, they are deeply suffering from the lack of schooling. People from Hubei Province in Hunan are planning to restore the school in Leiyang and temporarily establish a special normal science department to specifically recruit students with insufficient nutrition and early lung disease, to treat them and teach them at the same time, in order to meet wartime needs. They will also cooperate with Hunan Provincial Rural Medical Vocational School in order to obtain medical assistance. A school restoration committee has now been formed to concentrate on the work.</p>
<h3>Xiangya Medical College to be Nationalized: Zhang Xiaoqian Appointed President</h3>

<h3>Basketball Backboard Changed to Semicircular Fan Shape: Xiqing to Adopt this Year; 35 Inches High and 57 Inches Wide; Lingdong Team has Registered for Xiqing Tournament</h3>
<p>The 13th Xiqing Basketball Tournament is scheduled to open on the 9th of next month. This year, only Group A will be held, limited to 12 teams. Since the start of registration, in addition to the Xiqing Little Bears and Giants, the Chinese team Lingdong has registered to join. In addition, the basketball backboards used in this competition will be reformed, adopting the latest style. The backboard is a semicircular fan shape, 35 inches high and 57 inches wide, and is being custom-made. The basketball backboard has always been rectangular. Its function is that the ball can use the elasticity of the backboard to rub into the basket. However, according to competition experience, the upper half of the backboard has no function at all. It cannot bounce the ball into the basket, and it is rare for the ball to hit the upper half. Therefore, the American Basketball Association has decided to cut off the upper two corners of the backboard from this year and change it to a semicircular fan shape.</p>
<h3>Huai De Cup Re-match Issue: Decision to be Made in a Day or Two</h3>

<h3>Foreign Rice Swarms In: Approximately Over 100,000 Bags Expected to Arrive in Shanghai in the Coming Days; Yesterday's Rice Market Rose and Fell Sharply with Extensive Manipulation</h3>
<p>The supply of foreign rice is abundant. The Taikoo Company's Hubei vessel arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 12th) from Hong Kong with 5,736 bags. Because it was the Premier's birthday, there was a holiday that day, so yesterday's report did not mention it. Yesterday, the Taiyuan also arrived at the port, also carrying 1,075 bags from Hong Kong. It docked at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession and unloaded separately. The Jardine Matheson Yuesheng vessel entered the port yesterday afternoon. It is said that it also had rice onboard. The exact amount was not clear due to the holiday yesterday afternoon, and will be reported further. It is learned that the China Overseas Trading Company (Norse, Trader) vessel will directly load a large quantity of foreign rice from Saigon, totaling over 57,000 bags. It is said that the ship arrived at Wusongkou last night and can enter the port this morning. It is scheduled to dock at the Hongxing Wharf in Pudong for unloading. In addition, the French company's Harding (Khal Dinh) vessel also transported 1,700 tons from Saigon. It is said that part of it is Zhenzhu rice, originally scheduled to arrive today, but now changed to arrive tomorrow. It will dock at the Huashun Wharf in Hongkou. (Zu)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of foreign rice in the market suddenly rose and suddenly fell, fully demonstrating the activities of manipulators. The high and low prices varied by as much as three or four yuan. However, the final result yesterday was a few jiao to almost one yuan lower than the closing price on Sunday. In the early morning, rumors arose, and the price of all rice was raised by one yuan and a half to one yuan. No. 2 Saigon arrived at 70 yuan and was still trying to rise, while spot original bags were up to 81 yuan. The market atmosphere was extremely prosperous. Subsequently, because many rumors were disproved, blind speculators sold out. The market was slightly lower at noon. In the afternoon, there were more rumors of peace that were unfavorable to the bulls. People's hearts were even more shaken. Many large off-market players came out to sell, and the quick-profit business of chasing the wind immediately lost its momentum. The market then fell by a small yuan.

<h3>Flour Demand Increases Frequently: Foreign Flour Will Arrive Soon</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of trading for flour after the holiday. Spot flour transactions were quite active, because the price of rice continued to rise, and the number of common people who ate flour as a staple food increased. Therefore, demand in this street increased frequently, and although the wholesale price of various factories did not rise again, the supply has gradually been restricted. The two factories in the city wholesale sold more than 9,000 bags. Returned goods and old single warehouse receipts were favored by hoarders, with prices reaching 19 yuan 1, 2, 3 jiao, and there was still a lack of supply. The asking price of foreign flour was frequently high, but because the settled flour will arrive soon, people's hearts were inevitably discouraged, so this customer had no enthusiastic desire to purchase. The market situation was still in a calm and stable situation.</p>
<p>The market situation of new wheat was quite consolidated, because the arrival of goods has been rare for a long time, and the stock base was getting thinner and thinner.

At present, the market often does not react strongly to negative news, but when it comes to positive news, buyers flock to buy, fearing to fall behind. The biggest reason for this trend is still the surplus of floating capital. Yesterday's experience: In the early morning, Yuxing Hongda immediately sold out, and Category C immediately broke through the one-yuan mark. Xinchang Runde and No. 25 absorbed the market at low prices, and then raised one yuan. Lianyi Changji Tongshen and others also absorbed them one after another. Later, although Tongkang Hengfu and No. 38 continued to emerge, the market price was still rising slowly. In the afternoon, rumors swarmed, and buyers became even more enthusiastic. The market price surged, and immediately broke through the two-yuan mark. Category E also suddenly broke through the two-yuan mark.

<h3>Gold Market Turns Weak, People's Hearts Wavering and Uncertain, Period Changes Begin Today</h3>
<p>Yesterday's raw gold gray market, due to the loosening of foreign exchange and in the midst of absurd rumors, has rebounded and turned weak. However, in the midst of a sharp rise, there was bound to be lingering wind, so there was an unexpected surge, once flying out of 5,800 yuan. People's hearts in all directions were still wavering and uncertain. Since it was heard in the morning that foreign exchange had stopped tightening and returned to loosening, it retreated to 5,740 yuan in the morning opening under the selling trend. Unexpectedly, the foreign exchange only loosened slightly, and a certain bank's bull unexpectedly increased its position, and violently raised the scattered overnight positions, which had not been closed, once flying up to 5,825 yuan. Finally, due to the demand for tight foreign exchange, the upward trend was difficult to maintain, and it collapsed under the emergence of gold companies and banks. At noon, it was seen at 5,735 yuan, closing at 5,742 yuan, a slight decrease of 28 yuan. After closing, it fell again to 5,715 yuan. The total transaction volume for half a day was 4,000 taels.

A certain money shop bought cash, so it was closed at par with the forward price. Guan Jin, etc., were not changed.</p>
<p>Raw Gold Falls by 28 Yuan</p>
<p>In the early morning, people's hearts were watching and waiting, and no one was buying. The opening price was slightly lower. It was estimated that a gold company came out to sell 10 taels to the bank, and the price was 5,740 yuan. After that, the bank helped to fish, and at one time it actually defended the 5,800 yuan mark. It was estimated that a gold company entered the money exchange industry with 20 taels, creating a top plate of 5,825 yuan. Unfortunately, the high price was not easy to maintain for a long time. At this time, scattered households and others took the opportunity to sell, and it suddenly fell back, reaching 5,745 yuan. After a period of hovering, there was a slight upward trend. It was estimated that a bank gave 20 taels to a gold company, which was 5,770 yuan on the 7th. However, because foreign exchange had reported loosening, people's hearts were tired again, and gold and silver companies jointly closed. It was estimated that the bank did 30 taels of matching, and it fell sharply to 5,735 yuan again. Although it was stable later, the bank only did 10 taels of matching at noon, and there was only 5,742 yuan, which was 28 yuan smaller than Monday. It fluctuated by 90 yuan in half a day. The selling price of the cash company's original brand gold was more than 10 yuan higher than the raw gold, and the purchase price was 30 yuan lower.

<h3>Large numbers of Bulls close positions, Cotton yarn declines, Double Horse falls by 20 yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had risen for several days in a row, fell yesterday. The trend of decline was also strong. This was because the gold merchant's bulls closed a large number of positions, and the market fell under pressure. The demand from Hong Kong merchants continued to be strong, and the situation for spot yarn was weak. However, speculators took profits and closed positions, so the market price stepped down. It was found that the amount of large accounts remained unchanged. Some people also said that the problem of the source of cotton was still difficult to solve. Yesterday, there were 1,290 pieces of cotton yarn, and today there were another 680 pieces shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Nong Kai continued to advance due to the enthusiastic popularity of the previous day. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,295 yuan. As soon as this high price opened, those who made a profit closed their positions one after another. At the same time, many said that water can still penetrate the high price of 1,302 yuan last time. As a result, the number of people selling increased. In an instant, it fell to 1,281 yuan, but the foreign exchange rate once contracted, and the actual situation reappeared, rising again to 1,293 yuan. Then it was heard that the foreign exchange rate increased, and the gold merchant sold a large amount, and the table turned loose.

<p>The U.S. Navy transport ship USS Chaumont, carrying dependents of U.S. Navy personnel stationed in China, arrived from Qinhuangdao and is expected to arrive in Shanghai today (14th) around 1:00 PM. It is anticipated that family members of several U.S. Navy personnel stationed in Shanghai, as well as 130 soldiers from the U.S. Marine Corps' Fourth Regiment stationed in Shanghai, will depart on the USS Chaumont. According to information received yesterday morning (13th), the USS Chaumont may remain here for five days after arriving today, setting sail for Manila at the beginning of next week. It is believed that a group of U.S. Navy personnel dependents will also board the USS Chaumont in Manila for a swift return to the United States. It is reported that 130 U.S. Marine Corps soldiers stationed in Shanghai will board the USS Chaumont on Saturday or Sunday. However, it is not confirmed whether the ship is also carrying U.S. Marine Corps soldiers to relieve them here.</p>
<p>Former U.S. Flagship to Sail to the Philippines Soon</p>
<p>Shanghai received news yesterday that the former flagship of the U.S. Navy's Asiatic Fleet, the USS Houston, is expected to sail to Manila soon, replacing the USS Augusta, the flagship of the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet currently docked in Manila. U.S. officials in the city were unable to confirm whether the USS Houston would sail to the Seven Seas soon.</p>
<p>This Evacuation Exceeds Five Hundred People</p>
<p>According to the American President Lines, the final U.S. evacuation liner, the USS Washington, is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on November 21. It is expected that over five hundred American expatriate women and children from Shanghai will depart on the vessel, making this one of the largest groups of American expatriates to evacuate Shanghai. At that time, the total number of American expatriates leaving here at the urging of the State Department will be close to one thousand. It has been verified that the other two evacuation liners carried 325 people on the USS McLain and 85 people on the USS Mariposa.</p>
<p>Booking Tickets in Endless Stream</p>
<p>American expatriates in the city are currently booking tickets for the USS Washington from the American President Lines in an endless stream. It is reported that 100 first-class tickets, 300 economy-class tickets, and 140 third-class tickets have been sold to date. However, there are still vacancies in all three classes, especially in third class. The USS Washington will arrive in Shanghai at 3:00 PM on the 17th and dock at the Mobil Oil Company wharf. It is currently scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the 21st, stopping at Manila and then returning directly to San Francisco in the United States. However, the current itinerary is subject to change.</p>
<p>Mariposa Arrives in Qinhuangdao</p>
<p>In addition, the USS Mariposa, which sailed out of Shanghai early the day before yesterday (13th), will arrive in Qinhuangdao today (14th) to continue carrying American expatriates retreating from North China. Afterwards, it will sail to Incheon to evacuate American expatriates from Manchuria and Korea. A small number of American expatriates from Shanghai are also returning to the United States via regular ships of third countries, such as a certain ship of the Japanese Mail Steamship Company scheduled to depart from Shanghai for the United States on Friday, also carrying nine American expatriates.</p>
<h3>Zhou Daren Takes Family to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>After the French Concession's High Court No. 3 and the Second Special District Court were seized, Zhou Daren, the former Chief Clerk of the Second Special District Court, was appointed as "Chief Examining Officer." Because Zhou refused to accept the position, he has now taken his family to Hong Kong. The position of "Chief Examining Officer" is now being filled by Huang Yan, a judge dispatched from the Criminal Preliminary Court. Most of the original judges and examining officers have already gone to Hong Kong to work in the interior.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Board Meeting Discussion on Telephone Rate Increase Still Pending Continued Handling of Fair-Price Rice in the Settlement</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council held its regular board meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday. The Municipal Council usually holds its board meetings at 4:30 PM, but this rule was changed to hold the meeting in the morning due to the horse racing. Those in attendance were General Manager Keziwei, Chinese Directors Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Guo Shun, and Xi Wangshu; British Directors Helan, Mitchell, McDonald, and Bauer; American Director Kanai Alanman; and Japanese Directors Kao Xiong and Okamoto Otsusaku. The absent director was Chinese Director Jiang Yiping. The meeting lasted an hour and a half, adjourning at 11:35 AM.</p>
<p>Discussion of Agenda Items</p>
<p>After the board meeting adjourned, a Ping Ming News Agency reporter inquired with relevant parties. The issue of telephone rate increases was still not discussed at yesterday's board meeting, and no decision was made. This was because the French Municipal Council's reply had not yet been received. The other agenda items discussed included the report of the Council's Special Economic Committee, as well as issues concerning beggars within the Settlement and the handling of fair-price rice. It is reported that no decision has been made on the issue of beggars. As for fair-price rice, it was decided that it would continue to be handled.</p>
<h3>Four Banks' Shanghai Branches Deny Withdrawal All Rumors Are Untrue</h3>
<p>Regarding rumors that the Shanghai branches of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank were ordered to prepare to withdraw, a New Voice News Agency reporter inquired with the Shanghai branches of the four banks yesterday. The rumors of withdrawal are absolutely untrue. All business at the Shanghai branches of the four banks is proceeding as usual, and no withdrawal orders have been received. Moreover, the Tianjin branches of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Communications Bank have not withdrawn and are still operating. Therefore, all the rumors are untrue.</p>
<h3>Landmine on Shanghai-Hangzhou Train Derails Locomotive Passengers Must Transfer Trains</h3>
<p>Recently, trains on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway have repeatedly encountered landmines planted by Chinese mobile units. Japanese military trains have repeatedly been detonated by mines. A Ping Ming News Agency reporter received a reliable report from the Chinese side in Hangzhou yesterday that the Japanese-controlled Shanghai-Hangzhou train also struck a landmine explosion between Hangzhou and Xiashi the day before yesterday morning. The Shanghai-Hangzhou train was temporarily interrupted. It is reported that around 9:30 AM the day before yesterday morning, a local train traveling from Jiaxing to Hangzhou suddenly heard a loud bang when passing through the Xiashi station. A landmine exploded, and the locomotive was destroyed and derailed, thrown to the side of the road. The tracks were also blown up, causing traffic on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway to be blocked yesterday. All trains traveling between Hangzhou and Shanghai had to stop at the site of the landmine explosion, and passengers had to transfer trains.</p>
<h3>Felippe Takes Leave to Go to North China</h3>

Although the destination of this trip has not been specified, according to inquiries made by this reporter to various relevant parties yesterday, Mr. Felippe has decided to leave Shanghai for North China this morning, with Weihaiwei or Tianjin as his destination. According to sources close to Mr. Felippe, he will take the British Taikoo Company's new "Beijing" ship this morning, setting sail north at 10:00 AM today. During Mr. Felippe's two-week leave, his position as Director-General of the Municipal Council will be temporarily filled by Deputy Director-General Nash.</p>
<h3>American Motor Vessel Detained, U.S. Consulate Protests</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," the American motor vessel "Estetle" was intercepted by the Japanese naval authorities while returning to Shanghai on the 2nd of this month off the coast of Zhejiang. As of today (the 13th), the ship is still being held on the coast of Zhejiang. According to the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Lockhart, this morning, he has lodged a protest with the Japanese authorities regarding this matter, but has not yet received a reply from the Japanese Consulate. It is understood that the "L. Estelle L." is equipped with radio equipment, but attempts by Shanghai to communicate with the ship have been unsuccessful. Several passengers on board the ship when it was detained by the Japanese Navy have already arrived in Shanghai. It is noted that the "Estelle L." was previously seized by the Japanese naval authorities at the mouth of the Yangtze River about four months ago and released after two weeks.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Marked the Third Anniversary of the Fall of Shanghai, Citizens' Mood Solemn, Support for the National Policy of Resistance and Reconstruction Remains Unwavering, Precautionary Measures in the Concession Ensure Good Order</h3>
<p>Yesterday marked the third anniversary of the fall of Greater Shanghai. Due to the special circumstances, people from all walks of life in Shanghai were unable to hold commemorative ceremonies, but they all made solemn spiritual commemorations. However, all compatriots in the city recalled the loyalty and bravery of the soldiers who fought bloody battles in Shanghai three years ago, as well as the enthusiasm of people from all walks of life who destroyed their homes to help the country. This further increased their determination to strive for strength. Therefore, they are determined to endure hardship and work hard in the spirit of lying on firewood and tasting gall, striving to educate the people, and supporting the central government's national policy of resistance and reconstruction, which remains unwavering.</p>
<p>Precautionary Measures in the Concession Ensure Peace Throughout the Day</p>
<p>The police authorities of the two concessions continued to implement normal precautionary measures yesterday because it was the anniversary of the fall of Shanghai. Additional detectives were dispatched to patrol all roads, searching pedestrians and vehicles. The French Concession also dispatched armored vehicles to patrol the roads for security. The entire day passed peacefully in a calm and solemn atmosphere. The Japanese side also took strict precautions yesterday. Japanese troops were stationed in Pudong, Nanshi, Zhabei, Hongkou, western Shanghai, and various suburbs. Security was particularly strict along the bridges over the Suzhou Creek.</p>

Looking at his portrait, how can we not feel sorrow?</p>

<h3>Wu Kunsong and the Qinghua Army Are Becoming More Active</h3>
<p>According to a person from Kunshan County who came to Shanghai to talk, the local Chinese army guerrilla隊 has become more active since learning of the recent major victories of the Chinese army on various fronts and the news that the Japanese army in South and Central China are withdrawing. The Japanese army in Kunshan, Qingpu, Wu County, and Songjiang are finding it difficult to cope. On the 26th of last month, Li, the battalion commander of the first battalion of Chen Yaozong's department of the Chinese army, personally led the second and third companies to ambush at the Lingyang Port area between Chenmu and Jiaozhi. At that time, thirty to forty Japanese soldiers were sitting in two motorboats, passing through the area. The Chinese army immediately concentrated artillery fire to attack the Japanese army. The Japanese side was caught off guard, and one motorboat was sunk. The Chinese side obtained a large number of firearms. Only three Japanese soldiers survived. On the 5th of this month, five Japanese naval landing force shallow-water warships sailed from Suzhou, passing through Jiaozhi and heading to Chenmu. After Chen's regiment of the Chinese army heard the report, they immediately ordered all troops to move out and encountered the Japanese army in the Cangjiawan area. The two sides fought fiercely for two hours. The Japanese army was ultimately unable to land due to the dense Chinese gun fire and retreated due to heavy casualties.</p>
<h3>Special Economic Committee Pays Close Attention to the Reorganization of the Volunteer Corps After the Merger of the Russian Unit, Officers Have Been Significantly Reduced</h3>
<p>According to a temporary report from the Special Economic Committee of the Municipal Council, the officers of the Volunteer Corps headquarters have been gradually reduced in large numbers in recent years. Commander Gao is now preparing a plan to reduce staff to save money. The committee believes that the council should approve the above plan. Regarding the changes in the Volunteer Corps staff after the merger of the Russian unit into the police department, the committee has paid great attention to this matter.</p>
<h3>Fare Increases on French Electric Buses and Trams, Revenue Is Considerable, Residents Bear a Heavy Burden, Hoping for a Reduction</h3>
<p>After the French Concession Water and Electricity Company increased water and electricity rates on the 6th, citing increased expenses, the fares for public buses and trams were also increased by 30% and implemented yesterday. The general public is dissatisfied with the sudden increase in burden. There is also serious commentary in society regarding the company's arbitrary increase in various fees. Yesterday, first-class passengers on various vehicles decreased, while the third-class section became more crowded. Previously, the company's daily ticket revenue for trams was 30,000 yuan, and for public buses, it was 20,000 yuan, totaling more than 50,000 yuan. With this new price increase, the daily revenue should increase to 65,000 yuan. Its business prosperity is indeed the highest record in history. The general residents of this city hope that the company will consider the difficulties of the people and gradually reduce the increased fares soon. It is hoped that the French Concession authorities will pay attention to the fact that the company's increased profits affect the daily expenses of the citizens.</p>
<h3>Concrete Measures to Control Rent in the French Concession, Abolish Small Leases and Prohibit Transfer of Tenancy</h3>
<p>According to information learned yesterday, the French Concession authorities will soon submit a proposal to the French Consul General Majerry to take strict sanctions against acts of manipulating rents for profit and exploiting tenants in the French Concession. According to a senior official of the French Concession Police Department, the matter is currently under study. The detailed measures and regulations on how to impose sanctions cannot be released at this time. However, according to informal statements from legal circles, the planned measures include abolishing small leases, suppressing rents, and prohibiting high-priced transfers of tenancy. It is said that in addition, formal actions will be taken to ensure that the tenant removal fee demanded by the landlord does not exceed a fair percentage. Another clause is attached to the plan, stipulating that if both the landlord and tenant are satisfied, the Municipal Council will not interfere.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Women Sell Goods to Aid Refugees, Soliciting Donated Items</h3>
<p>The Women's Mutual Aid Group of the Guangdong Shanghai Christian Church, organized by Mrs. Guo Shun, Mrs. Cai Huimin, Mrs. Zheng Zhaobin, Mrs. Huang Zesheng, and Mrs. Rong Qizhao, will hold a fundraising sale of goods at the original site of the ice skating rink on the fifth floor of the Daxin Company on Nanjing Road on the 23rd of this month to aid refugees. In recent days, they have been soliciting donations of velvet fabrics, clothing, stationery, toys, food, calligraphy and paintings, and daily necessities from major factories and calligraphers and painters. It is reported that donations from major factories have been quite enthusiastic.</p>

<h3>American Donations of Rice, Wheat, and Winter Clothing, Showing Sympathy for Shanghai's Disaster Relief, Dr. Baker's Appeal Achieves Satisfactory Results, Many Departing American侨 Also Donate Used Clothing</h3>
<p>Mr. Baker, the Director-General of the American Red Cross, has decided to take advantage of his trip to the United States for vacation and appeal on behalf of Chinese refugees for donations from those who sympathize with them. The satisfactory results have not been seen before. Mr. Baker arrived in Chongqing from the United States via Hong Kong on October 22. Mr. Weslow accompanied Mr. Baker. The two will preside over the first batch of medicines arriving in China in Chongqing. After the arrangements are properly handled, Mr. Weslow will stay in the Southwest temporarily, and Mr. Baker will come to Shanghai alone to meet with relevant parties here.</p>
<p>First Batch of Medicines Landed in Yangon</p>
<p>It is understood that the first batch of relief medicines shipped from the United States to China is worth a total of 300,000 US dollars and will be transported to China via the Yunnan-Burma Road. It will be shipped from Yangon soon. Negotiations on transportation procedures and defense against surprise attacks are under close discussion. The first batch of medicines mainly consists of quinine, followed by aspirin, sulfanilamide, heavy carbonic acid salt, boric acid, anesthetics, gauze, cotton wool, wheat, etc. If the results are practical in the future, they will be continuously transported to China.</p>
<p>Rice and Wheat Shipped to Shanghai, Jude in Charge</p>
<p>The relief supplies shipped to Shanghai consist of 1,400 bags of wheat and 6,000 bags of rice, which have been shipped from Seattle, USA, and are expected to arrive here in mid-next month for distribution in the occupied areas. Regarding how to distribute them, the Shanghai side will be taken over by Jude, the General Secretary of the Shanghai American Navy Youth Association. Other medicines worth 50,000 US dollars are also shipped to Shanghai to benefit the poor, which is not a small amount.</p>
<p>Winter Clothing Shipped to Europe, Rerouted to Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the Continental Daily News yesterday, the Shanghai branch of the Fei Zhou Church has received several small batches of winter clothing donated by Australia and New Zealand in the past few months, and immediately transferred them to the Salvation Army, the European Jewish Relief Committee, and other charitable organizations to distribute to a small number of poor refugees in this city. Last week, a large batch of clothes from the United States was originally intended to be shipped to Europe for relief purposes, but due to transportation difficulties, they were stranded in the United States. Later, in view of the fact that Shanghai refugees also needed this relief, it was proposed to reroute them to Shanghai. After the news reached here, the Fei Zhou Church immediately telegraphed the headquarters of the American Church in the United States through the U.S. Consulate, urging them to quickly ship the large batch of stranded clothes to Shanghai to meet the urgent needs. It is said that there are two large packages of clothes.</p>
<p>Large Batch of Winter Clothing Arrives Next Month</p>
<p>In addition to the winter clothing donated by the United States, Australia, and other places mentioned above, people in this city have also been donating gradually in the past few months, especially in the past two weeks. At the same time, some Americans in this city, due to evacuation from Shanghai, have donated most of their old clothes to relief organizations, especially women's and children's clothing, so many refugees have benefited. However, most of these clothes are Western-style, so they are only used to relieve foreign refugees. The number of Chinese-style clothes received so far is very limited. Last week, the New York Fei Zhou Church in the United States telegraphed to inquire whether the winter clothing that could not be shipped to Europe due to the war could be used in Shanghai. After consultation with the U.S. Consulate Advisory Committee and the Salvation Army authorities, the Shanghai branch has replied by telegram that these two large packages of winter clothing will be shipped to Shanghai in early next month.</p>
<h3>Yunnan-Burma Road Is Busy with Military Supplies, Parcel Post Suspended, Restrictions Expected to Be Lifted After Two Months</h3>
<p>Since the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road, commercial parcels from Shanghai to the Southwest have been expected to be transported by this route, so the market price has been stimulated by this and has increased significantly. However, according to inquiries made by a reporter from Datong News Agency to the responsible parties of the Shanghai Postal Administration this morning, the bureau received a telegram order from the Kunming Postal Administration yesterday morning, suspending the acceptance of parcels from Shanghai to the Southwest via the Yunnan-Burma Road. Before the bureau received the above telegram order, it had been actively preparing to accept parcels to the Southwest. Dozens of applications from various merchants to the bureau for early acceptance of parcels to the Southwest were received every day, so they will definitely feel disappointed after learning of the above telegram order, which will indirectly stimulate a significant decline in prices. However, according to the latest inquiries made by a reporter from Datong News Agency, there are two reasons for the temporary suspension of parcel post on the Yunnan-Burma Road: (1) Military supplies and necessities need to be shipped first; (2) There are many accumulated Southwest parcels that need to be cleared. Therefore, the post office's acceptance of commercial parcels is expected to be suspended until two months later, and the previous telegram order will be lifted and acceptance will be resumed.</p>
<h3>American Missionaries in China Are Unwilling to Abandon Their Mission, Missionaries in the Occupied Areas Continue to Strive, Determined Not to Leave Until the Last Moment, U.S. State Department Sends Pastor to Shanghai to Discuss Steps</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of American citizens evacuating from the Far East, according to inquiries made by a reporter to the general offices of various American churches in this city, American missionaries throughout China, although prepared to comply with the orders of the U.S. government, are currently unwilling to leave their posts. The various churches are still discussing the evacuation order. Pastor Robert, who arrived in Shanghai three days ago, is currently discussing the policies that the American churches should adopt with his colleagues in Shanghai yesterday. It is heard that Pastor Robert was invited by the State Department to come to Shanghai to discuss evacuation matters with various churches. According to Pastor Robert, he does not intend to make any suggestions regarding this matter. Almost all American churches in Free China are not evacuating. Whether American missionaries in the occupied areas evacuate or not is up to each individual to decide. However, those who are older or weaker should evacuate early.</p>
<p>Few Missionaries Leave China</p>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," sources familiar with church affairs claim that the U.S. government has recently advised American citizens in the Far East to evacuate, as the Far East is one of the most potentially dangerous places. However, American Christian missionaries, who have been active in China for 111 years, will not leave China in large numbers and abandon their lifelong work. Currently, there are a total of 2,300 American missionaries scattered throughout China. Less than 150 of them will leave Shanghai on the last American evacuating ship, the "Washington," on the 21st of this month and return to the United States.</p>
<p>No Reason for a Mass Evacuation</p>
<p>The United States usually sends approximately 2,800 missionaries to China to engage in church work. Approximately 500 are currently on vacation in the United States, and another 50 have left China at the advice of the U.S. government and the instructions of the church headquarters. In addition, approximately 100 missionaries will leave China in the next week or ten days. A small number of missionaries who have been working in the occupied areas for the past three years will be transferred to Free China to take on new positions. However, there is absolutely no reason to expect a mass evacuation of missionaries, as church personnel are determined to continue their work until the last minute.</p>
<p>American Missionaries Concentrated on the Coast</p>
<p>American missionaries in Free China are not only not leaving the country, but their numbers are increasing. Those who have already left or are about to leave are missionaries stationed in the occupied areas. However, the position of American churches in China is different from that of churches of other countries, because most American churches are concentrated in the coastal areas controlled by the Japanese. It is understood that there are approximately 6,000 missionaries of various countries in China, of which American missionaries number 2,800, the largest number, followed by 500 British missionaries, and the rest are missionaries from other European countries. Two-thirds of American missionaries are concentrated in the coastal provinces from Hebei to Fujian.</p>
<p>Determined Not to Return Until the Situation Is Critical</p>
<p>In the inland areas, missionaries from other countries are in the majority. For example, there are more Canadian missionaries in Sichuan Province than missionaries from other countries. There are many Norwegian, Swedish, and British missionaries in Hubei, Hunan, Shanxi, and Shaanxi provinces. If the Japanese engage in anti-American activities in the occupied areas, American missionaries will find themselves in a very difficult situation and will be forced to move to work in the inland areas. However, American missionaries feel that if they leave the country, they will be playing into the hands of the Japanese. Furthermore, the cost of evacuating American missionaries is huge. After returning to the United States, it is difficult to resettle them for a while, and it is not known when they will be allowed to come to China again. There are many students in the four Christian universities in Shanghai, and there are 60 missionaries teaching, who are very experienced. If they all leave, it will be a major obstacle to the educational convenience of Chinese students. If the situation deteriorates to the extreme, American missionaries will eventually be forced to leave, but they will not bid farewell to China forever.</p>
<h3>Plague Spreads in Ningbo, Epidemic Enters Cixi, Seven More Deaths in the A-Class Isolation Hospital, Decision to Restrict Traffic and Implement Control</h3>
<p>The latest report on the prevention and control of the plague in Ningbo yesterday, according to telegrams from Ningbo, is as follows: 1. The 17th team of the Central Epidemic Prevention Team and personnel from the Zhejiang Provincial Health Department, together with the Yin County Epidemic Prevention Department, are actively carrying out disinfection work and cooperating to eliminate the epidemic as soon as possible. The Yin County Epidemic Prevention Department has also set up prevention and vaccination teams to eliminate the epidemic with the greatest determination. At the same time, a post-disaster committee was established, with Zhou Dali as the chairman. 2. Seven more people died in the A-class isolation hospital yesterday. There are still ten people with the plague living in the A-class section. 3. A plague victim was also found in Xiaoxi Town, Cixi, who died. It was found that the person had fled from the plague area of Ningbo to Cixi. After receiving the report, the county Epidemic Prevention Department immediately convened an emergency meeting and decided: (1) to cut off traffic to Yongming Temple; (2) to continue to implement traffic control in the urban area; (3) to send telegrams to each police station and the Guanhaiwei Police Station to secretly prevent and guard against the epidemic.</p>
<h3>Recruitment of B-Class Postal Workers, Examination Date Confirmed, January 19th of Next Year</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration's recruitment of B-class postal workers has been officially announced on the 16th, and registration has begun. A reporter from Datong News Agency has recorded the details below:</p>
<p>Examination Date</p>
<p>The bureau has officially announced the recruitment of B-class postal workers on the 16th, with a total of more than 200 positions. Registration will begin from the date of the announcement.

At that time, the bureau will establish an examination committee to preside over the examination matters in order to show seriousness.</p>
<p>Distribution Location</p>
<p>The reporter from the Kuoda Tongshe News Agency learned that the postal workers recruited will be sent to serve in the occupied areas of the Shanghai postal area, and a portion will be sent to work in the occupied areas of Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Guangdong provinces. The post offices in the Shanghai concession will not be hired. As for whether the examination will restrict gender, it will be decided when the announcement is made.</p>
<h3>U.S. Decides to Expand Maritime Business, Seven Giant Ships Will Sail to Shanghai, First Ship to Arrive in Shanghai at the End of the Month on Its Maiden Voyage, Ten-Year Plan to Build 500 Cargo Ships</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the European War, the ships of the belligerent countries have mostly stopped sailing to the Far East. Although there are still some ships traveling between the Far East and Europe, the safety of the voyage is a concern, making travelers hesitant. Neutral ships traveling to the Far East, the Pacific, Europe, and Australia are currently only the ships of the American President Lines, which have stepped up to replace them. In the future, the ships of this company may not be enough to meet the demand. According to inquiries made by a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency to the U.S. regarding this matter, the U.S. maritime authorities are vigorously seeking to expand Far East shipping.</p>
<p>Johnson Inspects</p>
<p>Regarding the expansion of Far East shipping in the United States, when the Dollar Company was reorganized last year, Mr. Ernest E. Johnson, the Far East representative appointed by the U.S. Maritime Commission, was responsible for actively carrying out the work. After being appointed, Mr. Johnson has inspected Japan, Shanghai, New Zealand, Manila, the South Sea Islands, Myanmar, India, and Australia. The inspections have just been completed recently. Mr. Johnson is currently in Shanghai and will go south soon to handle all U.S. shipping affairs in the Far East in Hong Kong, so that he can report his findings to the authorities.</p>
<p>New Ships Launched</p>
<p>The U.S. Maritime Department believes that expanding Far East shipping is a matter of urgency, and in order to meet the needs of world and Far East shipping, it has decided to actively expand U.S. maritime business. The American President Lines is building seven new 10,000-ton giant ships to sail from the United States to Shanghai to join the Far East routes and circumnavigate the world routes and sail the Pacific routes. The first new ship, the "President Jackson," was launched in mid-September of this year. It is currently being renovated internally and will depart from the United States at the end of this month and sail to the Far East. It is expected to arrive in port on the 12th of next month, and then go to the South Seas from Shanghai for its world circumnavigation maiden voyage.</p>
<p>Ten-Year Plan</p>
<p>The U.S. authorities are also actively dispatching ships to carry out maritime cargo transportation in the future. Although this cannot be realized for the time being, within ten years, according to a person in charge speaking to a reporter, the U.S. cargo fleet will expand to 500 ships, of which 350 will sail in the Far East, Pacific, and Atlantic, and the remaining 150 will be used as supplements. Once this shipping network is completed, it will dominate Eurasia. It is understood that Mr. Johnson, the Far East representative of the U.S. Maritime Commission, came to the Far East in 1919 and often traveled between Hong Kong and Shanghai, responsible for U.S. shipping affairs.</p>
<p>Resumption of Hong Kong and Vietnam Routes</p>
<p>As for the British and French ships sailing the Hong Kong-Vietnam-Shanghai route, since the Japanese army invaded South Vietnam on September 25, the British ships have stopped sailing to Haiphong and Saigon, and the French ships followed suit. Guangzhou Bay is also included. This matter has greatly affected the freight transportation of Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou Bay. According to reliable sources obtained by the reporter, the British naval authorities, seeing that the situation has eased and having reached an agreement with the French, have approved the British and French ships to resume the Hong Kong route first. Negotiations on resuming navigation to various ports in Vietnam will be conducted in the short term to make a final decision. However, the resumption of navigation is still pending.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Jewish Refugee Relief Society Handles Evacuation Work</h3>
<p>The Jewish refugees in this city have been suffering from economic difficulties due to the sharp reduction in donations recently, resulting in a serious food shortage. Details were reported in yesterday's newspapers. It is learned that the European Jewish Refugee Relief Committee is now seeking a solution and actively handling the resettlement and evacuation work. It has reached an agreement with the British Honduran government of the Americas and plans to continue sending refugees there to open up an industrial cooperation zone.</p>

<h3>Shooting of Japanese Officer, Japanese Side Conducts Major Search, Japanese Serviceman Assassinated Must Hold an Important Position, Strict Inspection of Pedestrians and Vehicles Continued Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," regarding the shooting of a high-ranking Japanese officer (yesterday, the 10th) in the morning on the Qiujiang Road, the Japanese authorities today (the 13th) are trying to arrest the murderer and have sent plainclothes Japanese military police to search buses and pedestrians in the Qiujiang district. It has not been possible to obtain information from the Japanese authorities regarding who the person shot yesterday was. It is believed that the Japanese officials' silence on this matter shows that the Japanese serviceman assassinated must hold an important position. It is also not possible to find out how the person was injured. It is understood that the murderer fled immediately after firing several shots. It is said that the Japanese authorities already know who committed the murder and are continuing to conduct a major search this morning.</p>

<h3>Two Cases of Extortion: Major Sum Extortion Solved, Chen Jianjing Extorted for 200,000 Yuan, Carriage Driver Conspires to Extort 50,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Chen Jianjing, owner of the Shenfeng Yarn Shop at 365 Ningbo Road, recently received a threatening letter from a self-proclaimed party, demanding that Chen support the party's military expenses, setting the price at 200,000 national currency. The language in the letter was extremely threatening. The day before yesterday, Chen received a phone call from the bandits, stipulating that the money must be delivered to the intersection of Hankou Road and Guangxi Road at 9:00 PM on the 12th. After Chen reported to the Public Concession Police, detectives were ordered to</p>
<p>wait in ambush. When the time came, two bandits arrived and contacted Chen's representative, Gu Ruizhi. They were immediately arrested by the detectives and taken back to the police station. Upon interrogation, the two bandits were identified as Zhang Shiqi (from Pudong) and Zhou Xihua (from Tongzhou). Based on their confessions, another person, Zhou Rushi from Tongzhou, was arrested at room 319 of the Mingshan Hotel on Guangxi Road. At the time, Zhou was entertaining a guide, a woman named Wang Meijuan, and Wang Xiaomei.</p>
<p>Investigations revealed that Zhang Shiqi and Zhou Rushi were adjutants of a certain unit in Pudong. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that the case required further investigation, so he requested a postponement for further questioning. After reporting to the judge for approval, the request was granted. Jin Rongsheng, a Chinese comprador of a certain foreign firm at 181 Jiangxi Road, residing at 75 Xiangkang Lane, Gubai Road, hired Zhang Buqi (aka A Da), a Jiangbei native, as a carriage driver. On the 21st of last month,</p>
<p>because he was laid off, Jin received three threatening letters from a bandit gang from the 19th of last month to the 10th of this month, demanding 50,000 yuan. The third letter contained two bullets, instructing him to deliver the money to Changchun Road in Zhabei. After Jin reported to the Xinzha Police Station, detectives were dispatched to investigate. Suspicion fell on the laid-off carriage driver, Zhang Buqi. While the investigation was underway,</p>
<p>Zhang suddenly went to Jin's residence to collect his bedding and was arrested by detectives. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan presented the case and requested detention. Judge Zhong ordered Zhang to be detained for a future hearing.</p>

<h3>Handgun Robbery, Gatekeeper Shot and Killed</h3>
<p>Lu Guoheng, 38 years old from Jingjiang, employed as a gatekeeper by Zhao Qiming, a wealthy Shanghai businessman living at 16 Laoshifu Road, was robbed by two bandits carrying Mauser pistols at 6:00 PM on the 10th while on duty. The bandits snatched Lu's service pistol. Lu resisted and was shot in the left leg, damaging a blood vessel. He died at 11:30 PM that night due to lack of medical attention. It is reported that Lu died in the line of duty, leaving behind an elderly mother, a wife, and three children. This has created a problem for the family's livelihood.

The issue of compensation will be discussed and generously allocated by the police and the employer.</p>
<h3>56,000 Bags of Flour: Export Disputes, Plaintiff Takes Opportunity to Demand Huge Sum for Intervention, Defendant's 3,000 Yuan Check Bounced</h3>
<p>A certain Li Tianhui recently hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the First Special District Civil Court, requesting a judgment ordering Licheng Company to pay a check for 3,000 yuan. Judge Tao Dejun opened the Civil Division One Court for a hearing yesterday. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that in late June of this year, the defendant entrusted the plaintiff to obtain an export permit for 30,000 bags of flour, agreeing to pay</p>
<p>a handling fee of one dime per bag. When the defendant shipped the flour, they paid the plaintiff a check for 1,000 yuan. Later, the defendant asked someone else to obtain an export permit to ship 16,000 bags of flour. Unexpectedly, the shipment was intercepted by a certain military unit at the Suzhou Creek estuary. The defendant then asked the plaintiff to find a way to resolve the issue. The plaintiff informed the defendant that 10,000 yuan was needed for intervention. The defendant finally agreed to pay 15,000 yuan, which the plaintiff used to successfully secure the release of the shipment. However, the defendant</p>
<p>failed to honor the 3,000 yuan check previously given to the plaintiff. Despite repeated negotiations, the debt remained unpaid, leaving the plaintiff with no choice but to file a lawsuit for payment of the check. It is said that the defendant's flour was destined for the occupied areas of Xuzhou, etc. The defendant Licheng Company's lawyer, Yao Fuyuan, argued that the plaintiff had originally agreed in late June to obtain an export permit for the defendant to ship 56,000 bags of flour to the interior, agreeing to a handling fee of one dime per bag, totaling 9,600 French francs. A 3,000 yuan check was immediately paid to the plaintiff. On June 28th, the first</p>
<p>shipment of 30,000 bags was indeed able to pass without obstruction. Later, 26,000 bags were shipped to the Suzhou Creek estuary and were suddenly intercepted by a certain military unit, claiming the permit was incomplete. The defendant negotiated with the plaintiff, but the plaintiff was evasive. Since the 26,000 bags of flour were worth hundreds of thousands and there was a risk of an accident and great loss, the defendant strongly urged the plaintiff to find a solution quickly. The plaintiff then demanded a handling fee of one yuan per bag. After repeated negotiations between the defendant and the plaintiff, the</p>
<p>handling fee for the 56,000 bags of flour increased to 15,000 yuan. The defendant agreed and paid the plaintiff 15,000 yuan in cash on July 1st, stating that the 3,000 yuan check previously given to the plaintiff must be returned. The plaintiff said the check had already been deposited into the bank and would be returned to the defendant after it was retrieved from the bank. Unexpectedly, the plaintiff filed a lawsuit based on the check. The defendant has already suffered a loss of nearly 10,000 yuan due to the plaintiff's lack of responsibility and cannot afford to lose another 3,000 yuan. The court reviewed the arguments and, as both parties held different views, deemed it necessary to summon witnesses for investigation. The court announced that the case would be adjourned to November 15th at 2:00 PM for further hearing.</p>

<p>Free Debate: Where Should Women Go? (4)</p>
<h3>Women Should Return to the Family</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhai</p>
<p>(6) Women and Self-Reliance: In any setting, being able to earn a livelihood and support oneself by contributing to society directly or indirectly through one's own efforts is self-reliance. The same applies to women. As long as they are not idle all day long, and can earn a living by doing beneficial work, such as raising and educating children, they are absolutely not dependent on others.</p>
<p>(7) Women and the Family: The family is originally a mutual aid group formed by men and women based on physiological, psychological, and environmental needs. Since the family is formed out of necessity, everything within the family is naturally most suitable for women's needs, allowing them to develop their unique instincts and achieve their great careers. As for the current irrationality of the family or the contempt and oppression women face, it is because people do not understand the "reason" for forming a family, nor do they know the importance of women in the family, and also because women themselves do not know their own importance. Therefore, as long as everyone understands the "reason" for forming a family and eliminates misconceptions, the family will become rational. On the other hand, if women exert their instinctive power and make themselves an important member with great responsibilities, they will not be despised or oppressed.</p>
<p>(8) Conclusion: People who are concerned about women's issues (not necessarily sociologists) are dissatisfied with the status quo and want to improve it, simply because they feel that women's lives are unreasonable. Now, women physiologically need a place to complete the work of "reproductive special ability" that can provide her with free work and free rest, psychologically need to exert her "maternal love special ability", and society and the country need a reasonable environment for women to produce healthy people. Women also need to complete a self-reliant career that suits her physiological and psychological special abilities in a reasonable environment. The "family" happens to be able to accommodate all of the above needs, then "women returning to the family" is the most reasonable and should be done.</p>
<h3>Women Should Go to Society</h3>
<p>— Yi Hui</p>
<p>(6) Women and Self-Reliance: Earlier, we said that women must have a career in order to develop their individual strengths. In this section, we want to say that women should each have a career for economic independence. Whether a woman is dependent on others is determined by economic conditions. Mr. Lu Xun said that if women do not obtain economic rights equal to those of men, all titles are empty. We see many women who manage household affairs and raise children at home all year round, while their husbands play cards, dance, and enjoy themselves and waste money as much as possible. Wives cannot interfere with their actions, because they are using their own money, and they have full control. What women can control is only the household expenses that their husbands give them each month. Some women are even deprived of this bit of right by their husbands. Are women living in such circumstances not a group of "dependent" and dependent people?</p>
<p>(7) Women and the Family: Every member that makes up a family, whether male, female, or child, is important. We don't need to emphasize the importance of women in the family. I often hear people say that a man without a normal job is often the worst husband at home. Isn't it the same with women? If a woman has a proper job, she will feel particularly interested in her children after returning home from work, and she can have a deeper understanding of her husband's career. By sharing each other's work experience and encouraging each other ideologically, their family life will be richer, happier, and more meaningful! Moreover, according to the experience of many professional women, spending the whole day with children is not as good as spending time with children at fixed times, which has a better impact on both mother and child.</p>
<p>(8) Conclusion: Finally, what I want to say is that the issue of where women should go should be determined by where China should go. If what we desire is a true Three Principles of the People's democratic republic, then the equality and freedom that all people should enjoy are also the rights that women should enjoy. We cannot imagine a true democratic country that can confine the women who make up half of its population at home, and not allow them to stand on an equal footing with men to develop their special talents and create happiness for the country and mankind. But, if what we desire is a society where a few people oppress and exploit the majority—and "we" of course belong to the privileged class—then of course we do not want women to enjoy freedom and equality, just as we do not want the majority of the people to enjoy freedom and equality. Before we discuss the issue of where women should go, we should first examine whether our views and attitudes towards social issues are correct. The wheels of the times are moving forward, and those who want to turn the wheels of history backward will eventually be eliminated by the trend of the times! (The End)</p>

<h3>Warmth-Keeping Product of 1940</h3>
<p>— Shui Zhi</p>
<p>As I wander the streets all day, I always see many young masters and fashionable ladies. The clothes they wear always feel light, thin, soft, and comfortable, vividly showing off their graceful demeanor, and making them feel extraordinarily fashionable. Although the weather has reached early winter, and many people who cannot return to their hometown have frozen to death on the streets, they are not afraid of the cold because of their thin clothes. One day, I happened to discover that their clothes are all lined with Tiger Brand "Rabbit Fluff" or "Camel Fluff" produced by Weilun Woolen Mill. No wonder they are light, soft, durable, gorgeous, and elegant. According to old Shanghai people, "It can be guaranteed that it will never shed hair, which is completely different from other camel wool. What is most amazing is that the 'Rabbit Fluff' produced by Weilun Woolen Mill can also be used to make short overcoats for fashionable ladies. There are dozens of colors. Even older people always like Tiger Brand 'Rabbit Fluff' and 'Camel Fluff' because it makes walking easy, elegant, and generous. But readers must know that when you walk into a company or a silk and satin shop, don't forget the Tiger Brand 'Rabbit Fluff' and 'Camel Fluff' produced by Weilun Woolen Mill. Each yard is pasted with the Tiger trademark and a blue rectangular Tiger Brand stamp. Otherwise, readers are easily deceived. It is gradually getting colder, please buy it quickly!</p>
<p>Hawthorne Case</p>
<h3>The Dancer's Fate</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 11: Zhao Boxiong's Confession</p>
<p>Hawthorne picked up the paper cutter that he had put down when closing the door again, raised his eyes slightly, and replied: "Regarding this point, although I have not yet obtained sufficient and reliable materials, I can guess that this woman is a person with a weak will. Speaking of Mi, it's really pitiful. She came out of a simple and honest rural society and fell into the melting pot of a material society, and she couldn't help but degenerate. She has sunk into the torrent of indulgence in enjoyment, and she can do anything for the sake of money, selling her body, selling her soul, selling the masses, and even selling everything!"</p>
<p>Zhao Boxiong nodded repeatedly and said: "Yes, yes, she is such a character. I was sent here with a special mission. At the same time, I heard that there was a conspiracy activity, hosted by a social butterfly. I felt that this was also within the scope of my mission, so I started investigating her actions and further dispelling her attempts. I knew that although she had withdrawn from the dance hall, she was still using the dance hall to engage in her illegal activities, specifically targeting public officials. I spent a lot of effort to get close to her. This woman is really extremely clever. In just a few days, she had already noticed my mission. She even dared to turn the tables and play a 'reverse trick'. In other words, she even wanted to use me as her tool. So at first, I tried to find a way to get close to her, and then she tried to find all kinds of ways to get close to me. She had been to my apartment twice overnight. She didn't get anything the first time. The second time was the night before last, the 16th. While I was fast asleep, she wanted to steal my secrets. She had checked my wallet, pockets, and pillow, and finally stole a secret code from my pillowcase."</p>
<p>Zhao Boxiong paused, took out the white towel again, folded it over, and wiped his face again. Hawthorne took advantage of this time and said lightly.</p>
<p>"You are too careless. Since you are taking on an important mission, how dare you let yourself get involved with such a woman and let her spend the night in your room? You didn't carefully hide your documents, and you were so ignorant when you slept. You probably have really fallen into her trap and been fascinated by her!" The tone of these words was as cold as a superior reprimanding his subordinate in person.</p>
<p>Zhao Boxiong saw Hawthorne's iron-cold face, a red flush appeared on his face, and he couldn't help but feel a little ashamed. He lowered his head and replied slowly: "Mr. Hawthorne, I deserve to die! I dare not deny that this move was indeed a mistake. However, the stolen code has expired and is of no value. The effective one, I hid in the hatband, and she didn't find it. So I didn't notice her actions the next day until yesterday morning when I learned that the outdated code in the pillowcase had been stolen by her. This confirmed that she was indeed a central figure in a dangerous organization. I decided to take urgent action to punish her. Yesterday evening, I went to her apartment to find her, but I didn't find her. I knew that she had gone out with someone named Lu. I guessed that they were always in some restaurant, and I finally found them in the Baimei Restaurant." (165)</p>
<p>Small Talk</p>
<h3>Swallows and Geese</h3>
<p>— Xiu Bi</p>
<p>The wind is cold, it is late autumn.</p>
<p>Autumn once had a high, clear blue sky and clean white clouds.</p>
<p>And what dotted this high sky and white clouds, as if drawing thin black lines on a blue and white canvas, were swallows and geese.</p>
<p>Swallows and geese, these are two kinds of flocking migratory birds! They are a sign of autumn.</p>
<p>With them, the lonely autumn has life. With them, people who live in autumn feel the meaning of life.</p>
<p>They are raising their heads, spreading their wings, flying far away and back again.</p>
<p>Between the blue sky and white clouds, they are black, long lines.</p>
<p>Children look up and sigh when they see them.</p>
<p>Poets write them into verse, and musicians fill them into music.</p>
<p>But they don't know all of this. They are just flying and flying, raising their heads, flapping their wings, and hurrying on their way in the quiet high sky in groups.</p>
<p>They have crossed many cities, towns, mountains, forests, and deep seas. Their wings may be tired, but they will not stop because of it. In order to seek warmth and survival, they fly forward, fly forward, until they reach their destination?</p>
<p>And when spring comes, they each fly back, raising their heads, spreading their wings. They live in this long-distance flight all their lives. They are warriors who like long marches.</p>
<p>Their bodies are not majestic. They do not have the strength of eagles or the majesty of vultures. What makes them fly such a long road is their courage, their persistence, and their strong will.</p>
<p>Courage, persistence, and strength. Who can't travel a long distance if they have these!</p>
<p>Look! Between the blue clouds and white clouds, geese and swallows are again raising their heads, spreading their wings, singing songs, and marching for a long distance. Timid people! Raise your heads!</p>

<h3>Tibetan Movies: Fishermen's Song Continuously Shown in Lhasa for Three Months, Tibetan Compatriots Eager for Films from the Motherland</h3>
<p>— China Arts</p>
<p>(Special Correspondent in Lhasa) Tibetan movies have always been under the control of the British. There are several large-scale sound cinemas in Lhasa, Tibet, and the construction equipment is very modern, but they are all operated by the British. Nine out of ten of the films shown are British productions. The other two or three cinemas run by Tibetans are third- and fourth-rate cinemas. The interior is dilapidated, the prices are the lowest, and the films shown are all the most outdated. The audience is also some of the poorest people.</p>
<p>Because Tibet is influenced by British culture, English is still widely popular there, so British films are not inconvenient for people in Tibet. Therefore, the entire film industry is occupied by the British. However, it has not been the case in recent years. Tibet is warmly welcoming our domestically produced films. The "Fishermen's Song" once came to Lhasa, making the Tibetan audience, who had never seen domestically produced films before, as happy as discovering a new continent. The "Fishermen's Song" was originally scheduled to be shown in Lhasa for two weeks, but the results were unexpectedly good. It was shown continuously for three months, and the audience was always crowded. "Go see a Chinese film!" "Go see a Chinese film!" became the entertainment slogan of the Tibetan people. Later, several domestically produced films were continuously transported there, and they all achieved the same effect as the "Fishermen's Song."</p>
<p>Tibetan compatriots are eager for films from the motherland to give them spiritual comfort!</p>
<h3>Tidbits from the Chrysanthemum Scene (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Shan</p>
<p>(23)</p>
<p>The young bearded actor Chi Shigong loved planting flowers. The year before last, while in Beijing, he was careless while planting flowers and got pricked on the finger by a cactus needle. He didn't pay much attention to it at the time. That night, he was performing "Beating the Drum and Scolding Cao" at a certain theater. During the performance, the injury on his finger suddenly worsened, causing unbearable pain. He hastily finished the scene and rushed to the hospital for treatment. Afterwards, Chi told people, "I never thought the cactus would launch such a poisonous attack!"</p>
<p>(24)</p>
<p>The Four Great Dan Actors each excel in their respective parts in the play "Mei Long Zhen." Years ago, when the Four Great Dan Actors were all in Beijing, Qi Rushan suggested that the Four Great Dan Actors jointly fund the renovation of the tomb of Li Fengjie, a character in the play. Li's tomb is located south of Juyong Pass, and the locals call it "Bai Fengzhong" (White Phoenix Tomb). The tomb had already collapsed, leaving only an earthen mound surrounded by white sand and gravel, with not a blade of grass growing. Qi initially proposed that each of the Four Great Dan Actors contribute 250 yuan, totaling 1,000 yuan, and erect a tombstone to record its history. In the end, it did not materialize due to other reasons. Someone said, "Four two-hundred-and-fifties (a derogatory term implying foolishness) are of course not going to succeed," which became a popular joke for a while.</p>
<p>(25)</p>
<p>Kunqu King Han Shichang's reputation during his prime was no less than that of Wang Hua. Therefore, he was known as the "Syphilis Mei" and "Typhoid Fever." Unexpectedly, Han has not been very successful in Beijing in recent years. It is recorded that in the seventh year of the Republic, when Han performed at the Tianle Theater in the old capital, he and Zhu Xiaoyi competed fiercely in cross-dressing as doctors. Both played the role of a clown. Shichang rarely cross-dressed; if he did, this would be the only instance.</p>
<p>(26)</p>
<p>One year, Xiao Yang Yuelou performed in Shanghai, co-starring with Zhou Xinfang and a certain Kun Dan in "Red Mane Steed." The posters read "Xue Pinggui and Wang Baochuan." Xiao Yang Yuelou played the role of Princess Daizhan in the play and was greatly displeased. He argued vehemently to change the poster to read "Xue Pinggui and Wang Baochuan, Princess Daizhan." The peculiarity of the play's title is similar to Wang Xiaonong's song "Thirty-Three Thousand Three Hundred and Seventy-Three," both being original creations.</p>
<p>(27)</p>
<p>Hou Yulan once performed in "Peacock Flies Southeast," holding up a red lantern during a scene where she was being scolded by her mother-in-law, not knowing where to place it. Suddenly, the flame began to burn the gauze cover of the paper lantern. Wang Lan was greatly embarrassed, blowing it out and reigniting, blowing it out and reigniting, her demeanor quite awkward. At that time, Zhang Jinliang, who played the mother-in-law, hurriedly snatched the lamp, ad-libbing, "You're trying to anger me to death, not even knowing where to put the lamp, almost setting it on fire!" However, even in Jinliang's hands, the lamp caught fire twice, making it impossible to explain the situation plausibly. The audience roared with laughter.</p>
<p>Ballad Character</p>
<h3>"King of Depiction" Xia Hesheng</h3>
<p>— Yuxiu</p>
<p>Xia Hesheng is undoubtedly one of the top ballad singers in the current ballad scene. He is from Jiashan, Zhejiang. The Xia surname was originally a prominent family in Jiashan, residing in "Xia Ting," which was a well-known place locally. His father was known for his skill in painting portraits of gods and Buddhas, making him famous at the time. Therefore, he had a natural love for art from a young age and was also very fond of music. For someone like him to pursue ballad singing, it was naturally the most ideal choice.</p>
<p>He studied under Meng Youqing, learning "Depicting Golden Phoenix," "Three Smiles," and "Two Books," with "Depicting Golden Phoenix" being his specialty. For more than ten years, he has dominated the ballad stage with this book, earning the title of "King of Depiction." At one point, he was expelled from the Guangyu Society due to some incident, unable to work. Later, through the mediation of colleagues, he was able to resume playing his instrument and return to the stage to make a living.</p>
<p>Xia Hesheng is tall and upright, with an elegant demeanor and a handsome face. He has a good voice that doesn't tire even after singing for a long time, his voice being clear and bright, with each word fully articulated. His inflections and tempos are all appropriate and measured, allowing him to manipulate his voice freely, fully satisfying the audience's auditory cravings. Moreover, his facial expressions and character portrayals are particularly keen, vividly capturing the essence of the characters. He sings and performs earnestly in every performance, never cutting corners or inserting irrelevant jokes to waste the audience's time. This is his strength. However, he also has shortcomings. He is arrogant and has a bad temper. He is not easily "convinced" in ordinary venues, and he immediately "cuts" if the audience "drifts" (becomes inattentive). Therefore, he has consistently failed to find a satisfactory position in recent years, suffering a great loss due to this shortcoming.</p>
<p>As the late great ballad singer Ye Shengyang said, "The making of a great ballad singer does not necessarily depend entirely on his skills, but it cannot be achieved entirely by luck. It is difficult to find someone with all-around talent. As long as one has a special skill, it is not difficult to gain a considerable position." Xia Hesheng has relied on his singing and performing strengths to earn his current position as "King of Depiction." As for his shortcomings, although they are common among great ballad singers, we still hope that he can "correct them if he has them, and strive to avoid them if he doesn't."</p>
<h3>Lighthearted News from Hollywood Stars</h3>
<p>— Shawi</p>
<p>The newlywed Loretta Young has four sisters. The eldest sister, Polly Ann, is a lady of leisure. The second sister, Sally Blane, is also a movie actress, but not as famous as her younger sister, Loretta Young. Loretta Young is now preparing to bring her five-year-old younger sister, Georgiana, into the studio to work. It is said that the little sister looks exactly like Loretta Young and has a similar personality.</p>
<p>Madeleine Carroll, who was once reported missing, has now returned safely with her mother. But it is unknown whether she brought back a handsome French pilot as her husband this time. It is remembered that her first husband was also a member of the military (British), named Lieutenant Philip Astley.</p>
<p>After completing "All This, and Heaven Too," Bette Davis took a trip to Hawaii and took many beautiful scenic photos to bring back as souvenirs.</p>
<p>New singing sensation Ilona Massey and handsome young Alan Curtis have fallen in love, spending almost every night together. MGM is very dissatisfied with this, feeling that such a romance will affect Ilona's bright future. There are many people in Hollywood betting on this, and most people believe that MGM's dissuasion will be of no use.</p>
<p>Some people have seen Flora Robson often with Broderick Crawford and have spread rumors that her love with Waler Coakes has broken down. Robson made a serious statement about this, saying, "My love with Waler Coakes is still the same as before, but you can't ask me to sit at home every night, can you, when Bob is out?"</p>
<h3>Deanna Durbin Kissed Three Times</h3>
<p>— Paul</p>
<p>Deanna Durbin already possesses the beauty of a young woman. She can portray a woman in love, so her recent films have undergone some changes in style compared to before.</p>
<p>In "First Love," she kissed someone for the first time in a film, the lucky man being Robert Stack. Many people envied his good fortune. The second time was in "It Started with Eve," the recipient being Charles Laughton. However, Charles only kissed her forehead, because according to the plot, Charles's age was much older.</p>
<p>Deanna Durbin's third kiss was in "Spring Parade," which is currently in production. The male lead is Robert Cummings, and because he wears a sergeant's uniform and can play both piano and violin, she falls in love with him.</p>
<p>This new film, under the joint collaboration of producer Joe Pasternak and director Henry Koster, will achieve even greater success. Set in Vienna in 1896, with scenes ranging from a village gathering to a palace ball, the musical numbers provide the lead actors with many opportunities to display their acting skills.</p>
