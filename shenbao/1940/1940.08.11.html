<h3 id="c11">英國撤退駐軍 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>英國陸軍部於隔昨即入月九日，正式宣布：現在駐紮中國上海與華北之英國軍隊，均將撒退，調往他處服務。考英軍駐華並無一定員額，今駐北平者五十名，駐天津者一百二十名；駐上海者三營之外，有醫療隊，護士隊，交通隊，工程隊，服務隊，曁憲兵，共計將佐士兵一千五百七十名，組織完備，配備齊全，三地隊伍，統歸西蒙斯少將指揮。據聞，開拔之期即在下星期；然英國陸軍部所公布者，僅稱將撒，並無限期之明令；且此次撤退是否由於軍略上之見地，容待申論，而其駐在上海平津之本意則非由軍略；軍略性質之駐軍、其撒退輒貴神速；非軍略性質之駐軍則其打動亦猶待考慮決定其時機於軍略之外。允如上海，情形複雜；駐滬英軍於其駐在之日，旣就地負有國際性之任務，則其撤退雖以其祖國軍令而勢在必行，但對於國際任務，有待磋商決定交代明白；故下星期是否成行，殊未可必耳。</p>
<p>英國此次決定撒退駐華軍隊，事屬突然；就事論事，有應認識者四：其一·英國駐軍中國，在一八九九年直魯間義和團之亂，翌年聯軍陷京師，又翌年，一九〇一年締結辛丑和約，此即駐軍之條約根據也；事關條約上之權利、條約一日不發，權利一日存在；復關聯軍之共同行動，其間各國自有相互關係；故英國此次一面撒軍，一面聲明條約權利之依然保留、同時通知有關之諸國；此中脈絡，必須體認明白。其二·駐軍僅黛條約權利之一端，其他權利之以條約爲根據者，亦賴條約爲保障，非以駐在軍隊之力量爲保障。其三，條約權利不以駐軍之多寡有無爲衡，亦即駐軍之增减進退，無關於條約上之其他權利，更非可象徵權威勢力之消長。其四，英國撒退駐軍，以其陸軍部之命令爲依據，此與英國之海軍無涉；陸軍旣撤，其遠東艦隊如何調遣安排，應爲今後允可注意之對象；換言之，英國在遠東，仍有其武力，即海軍是也。</p>
<p>右舉四端，極簡明之平面說明也。抑英國何爲而突然出此舉措乎？現代戰爭，規模宏偉，力量務充實，計算務精確；是以內而主持軍國大計者，外而支配前後戰綫者，雖一兵一卒，一槍一彈，不使虛耗、珍重之，善用之，務期實益。英國方事對德作戰，斯爲軍略上之集中全力起見，不欲一千七百四十健兒長此逗留中國。誠以如此數量，置之無可致力之地，則可瞬息而歸殲滅；用得其所，則亦可扼守二三據點而獨當一面；權衡重輕，斟酌緩急，自以調往他處服務爲得計。英國陸軍部之所公布，絕無何種說明、意者，以此說明爲最堂皇乎！姑不問英國對此是否將作說明，亦不問是否如此說明，但以英國與遠東關係之密切而繁複，以遠東現象之紊亂而渾沌，醞釀演變之不可究詰，則僅以上述戰時軍略上之理由，說明撤兵之舉措，實感不足。各方推論，亦復紛紜不一。或謂英國以撒兵表示與日本妥協。然英國非退出遠東則英日妥協無法成立，撤兵旣未可視爲退出遠東之徵，亦即不足以博得日本歡心；况且撒兵之形式與時機言之，英國旣未表示接受日本關於歐洲交戰國各撤駐華軍隊之提議，亦未以此作爲外交折衝之題材；更以英國近頃對日之其他舉措比附觀之，妥協說殊未可置信。或謂英國以撤兵爲對日强硬之準備。然英國在上海與平津之權益，實甚可觀，斷非千餘將士之力量所得加以保全，但爲此可觀之權益而殉之干餘將士，亦不謂過；况堅強對日之道正多，英日間破裂之期猶遠，上海平津之央僑難撒　未撒，何以駐軍易撤而竟先撤？是以謂爲轉趨强硬，亦嫌證據不夠。二者就非。以吾人臆測，英國自知遭遇之艱難，亟謀充實其香港緬甸新加坡諸地防務；此外則堅壁淸野，藉以爭取其行動之最大自由而已。爲彼自由行動作取捨之準則者：德國攻勢之强弱，一也；日本壓迫之張弛，二也；而美國之國際態度以及中國之抗戰情况，亦彼資以決策之主要因素也。</p>

<h3 id="c39">歐戰實録（五）　法國潰敗的原因（續） <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>法國因何潰敗？凡爾登英雄貝當上將在上次歐戰時曾以「不放他們過去」的不朽口號挽回了戰局，今日他所領導的波爾多政府爲何與德國元首希特勒簽訂休戰條約？法蘭西共和及其偉大的軍隊已經遭遇了什麼命運？</p>
<p>法國的偉大與勇敢是無可置疑的。每一個法國人，不問是平民，或是兵士，在過去及最近迭次戰役中，他們的勇敢久已有口皆碑，那些沒有遭遇到現代戰爭中空襲及戰車攻擊恐怖的人不配作不負責任的批評。那些久居法國並愛法國的人，應爲懷疑法國偉大的民族性的最後一人。</p>
<p>但記者詳細硏究法國最近的情事及憑僑居法國七年的經騐，可作下列的推斷：</p>
<p>（一）法國失敗的主要的原因，是由於其民主政體的失敗。這並不是民主政治的失敗，也不是法國人民的失敗。這就是說，法國政治制度，在這人類歷史的大時代不能應付獨裁的軍國主義的無情打擊。</p>
<p>這是一個領袖問題，或者設是缺乏領袖問題，首先缺乏政治領袖，其次缺乏軍事領袖。法國的一蹶不振卽以此爲禍根。</p>
<p>覆按各種記錄，我們可以發現，在法國及在英國，都有許多靑年將校，早已正確的豫見到德軍進攻的方式，但屢次向英法政府建議，籌劃適當的方策，應付這種攻勢，兩國政客的惰性及目光短淺徒使這些警吿如對牛彈琴。</p>
<p>（二）消極地採取法國可在馬奇諾防綫後保持安全的理論，及過分拘泥於守勢戰略的原則，徒使法軍參謀部多數參謀的主動精神和勇氣爲之頽喪。某某份子縱非叛國，也是犯了作戰不力的罪。</p>
<p>（三）法國的精兵及下級軍官，在色當陷落後，早已感覺到爲其最高統帥所誤。各方面報吿都證實許多法國大小兵團均能英勇作戰，有些地方，甚至孤軍奮鬥。</p>
<p>但是這些報吿也一致證實，法國大部份士兵（他們都是有思想的）一致自供，「我早已曉得我們法國政府當局的腐敗情形，但我還想我能夠信任我們的將領，目前我們的將領也貽誤戎機了，還有什麼用？」</p>
<p>德軍第一次突破陣綫後，這一類普遍的頹唐心理，卽已傳佈到法國軍隊的某某部分，這是千眞萬確的情事。</p>
<p>（四）法軍最高當局有些地方竟也不免貽誤戎機。舉例來說，法國軍隊在法蘭德斯被切斷六天之久，沒有接到總司令部任何軍令。這是令人難以置信的事但確是實情。及至索姆河及埃納河陣綫第二次被衝破後，法軍總司令部差不多完全解體了。</p>
<p>（五）法軍陣綫的被突破就是決定法蘭西之戰勝敗的關鍵，一切觀察家都承認其原因，一部分由於沒有炸毀末斯河上的橋樑，這是最大的失策。另一部分由於巴黎的政客們昏庸到沒有明白盧森堡及比利時邊境的要塞，是否如馬奇諾防綫一樣的鞏固，還有一部分是由於調遣配備不良的次等軍隊防守比利時盧森堡的邊境要害地帶，這也是一個無可寬恕的大錯</p>
<p>還有一部分原因，是由於德國陸軍，尤其是德國空軍，在數量上及配備上所佔的優勢。但主要的原因，在於法國軍隊完全沒有防備到德軍大批戰車與大批戰鬥機轟炸機，密切聯絡集中進攻。除陸上及空中龐大機械化怪物聯合進攻外，德國方面還有訓練精勁呼應靈敏的機械化步兵，神速的跟進，支持戰車的進襲。據觀戰者吿余，法軍作戰時仍墨守着訓練時的軍令，一見敵機飛到，卽紛紛伏地，或避入樹林，或躱在各種掩蔽物後，以爲可以避彈，詎知他們出來時，德軍的戰車隊早已浩浩蕩蕩開過了</p>
<p>（六）法國人的邏輯，在紙上談兵時極爲優良，但絕對不能應付這種突如其來的新形勢。結果是高級軍官中沮喪解體，這種情形並且很快地傳遍全軍</p>
<p>法國人這種拘泥的邏輯還使他們政治軍事當局發生一種推斷，以爲前綫旣被突破，軍隊旣已解體，勝利就不可能，法國也無獲勝的希望，從邏輯上講，法國只有要求停戰。</p>
<p>在同樣環境之下，重本能不重論理的英國人，第一便不承認有戰敗的可能，第二主張惟一出路在於繼續作戰。</p>
<p>（七）波爾多政府羅致拉伐爾爲副總理，使法國投降更表現一一種不愉快的印象。波爾多政一府外交部長波丹及拉伐爾兩人一，都是遷就義大利派的健將。一就是貝當總理在任駐西班牙大使時，對於西班牙元首佛朗，也甚擁護，這並不是一件毫</p>
<p>總之，法國戰敗的原因在於戰爭爆發前，未能早將全副精力，按照極權國的產量，製造飛機，戰車，軍火及其他重要軍用品。</p>
<p>英國未能以配備更完全的軍隊，猶其是未能以更多的戰鬥機森炸機，來對付德國機械化部隊的進攻，無疑的應與法國共同担負責任。</p>
<p>但這一切的根本原因還在於法國歷年來政潮起伏，有時看起來似乎是一個不統一的國家。在法國人民中帝制派也，保皇黨也，貴族也，工業巨頭也，始終沒有完全失去他們龐大的勢力。另一極端呢，則有共產黨與社會黨，在勞工界中，擁有極大的潛勢力。</p>
<p>法國刻苦耐勞的農民，在一九一四年前占法國全人口百分之八十，到了一九四〇年已降低至百分之五十以下。以往十年中，法國如果沒有戰爭的威脅，或者已可和平的完成一種革命性的變遷，現在戰爭與失敗的慘澹黑影中，她當前最大的奮鬥，當然是謀復興了。</p>

<p>自倫敦及本埠英軍當局、宣佈撤退其在華北及上海駐軍、調防他處後、在全市中外居民中、已引起深刻反響、蓋租界地位、正當風雨飄搖之秋、政治局勢、允呈波譎雲詭之狀、英軍適於此時飄然遠引、自不能使人無動於衷也、一般懸揣英國撤軍用意、不外兩端、若非移軍南駐、對日本南進野心、予以無言之答覆、卽爲緩和日本之暗示、倘爲後者、自則無異英國已宣吿退出遠東、而欲以其根深蒂固廣大雄厚之權力、付諸流水、英國自不至不智若此、且英國已通知日方、聲明保留其一九一〇年九月七日北平最後議定書所給予之權利矣、倘爲前者、則已明示英國對日之態度、將趨於積極、據倫教方面所傳消息、此舉係加强遠東英軍之實力、果爾、則移軍之舉、意義至爲重大、至英軍撤離後之防區接替問題、一般均深盼能由美軍接充、此舉本埠美當局雖已聲稱須由華盛頓方面決定、但事實上英國撤軍、早得美方默契、美軍接防之事、自有極大可能、而反使租界情形、趣於單純與穩定、茲分誌各情如下、</p>
<p>中外人士一致關切</p>
<p>自倫敦發出準備撤退上海之英國防軍後、本埠一般人士、無不十分關切、無論電車與公共汽車商店與寫字間、一切公共塲所莫不以此事爲談話資料、一般評論者意見、因鑒於近頃政治發展、巳使公共租界處於微妙地位、而今英國突有撤退防軍之決議、認爲不智之舉、</p>
<p>在華權益並不放棄</p>
<p>昨據英國外交界某氏談、英方此舉、純係基於其整個局勢之一種措置、如外界認此舉卽爲英國將放棄其在華權益與地位、實屬誤解、蓋英國在華權益、殊爲鉅大、決不輕易放棄也、對英國撤退後、本埠英軍防區將由何方接管一點、氏稱現尙無所知、但不久當可分曉、記者復詢英軍撤退對公共租界局勢有何影響、渠則不能有所表示、但稱、英方對上海公共租界局勢、今後仍密切關注、並不改變其以前之態度、</p>
<p>三國軍官昨有會談</p>
<p>據可靠之關係方面消息、昨日上午十一時、地豐路英國防軍司令部內、曾舉行重要會談、蓋美國防軍及日本陸軍方面、均先後赴英軍司令訪晤西蒙斯少將、衆信英美日三國軍事長官之會談、當於英軍撇退後之接防問題、作初步會商、又據記者復向其他關係方面探詢、則美日雙方於昨晨十時、各派高級軍官往訪英軍司令西蒙斯少將、乃爲探詢英軍之撤退問題、並非舉行會晤、</p>
<p>各國防軍下週集會</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、今（十日）晨探悉、英軍宣布撤離上海後、衆料駐滬各國防軍司令將於下週初舉行會議、俾修改公共租界各軍防區、本市英軍司令部頃發出通知、謂駐滬英軍、一切存欠賬目、皆應於一週內結束、故料英軍將於下週內離滬、本市今晨得悉英陸軍部宣布撤退西福資隊與東塞萊隊英軍、頗感震驚、蓋自一九二七年起、英軍卽與他國軍隊同駐上海也、</p>
<p>未撤退前防務時常</p>
<p>駐滬英軍發言人今晨吿記者稱、英軍兩大隊撤離上海之確切日期、迄今未能宣布、惟目下英軍將賡續在各自防區內照常值崗駐守英軍撤退、乃現行歐戰中「自然的行動、」</p>
<p>義國駐軍暫留上海</p>
<p>又據駐滬英總領事喬治吿記者稱、渠對「市長」傅筱庵要求各交戰國駐滬軍隊撤退一節、前已置覆、英陸軍部今此決議、渠尙未吿傅、惟英軍開拔日期正式宣布時、渠或將正式通知與傳、記者今晨向駐滬義海軍陸戰隊指揮官莫朗特中校叩問、駐滬義兵約三百名、不久將否、亦離上海、據答稱、渠尚未接　馬訓令、故義軍將暫</p>
<p>商團俄隊接防虹口</p>
<p>關於調防事、聞英軍　離上海後、西福資高地隊英兵所守之西虹口防區、將由商團俄國隊接防、崦滬西鐵路綫附近以內、沿凱旋路與極司非爾路今由曲塞萊隊英兵駐防區內之防務、將續有變更、</p>
<p>滬西一帶美軍接管</p>
<p>傳聞沿滬西邊界一帶防務、將由美海軍第四陸戰隊接管、惟此說未能證實、而美陸戰隊官員對此拒不發表任何言論、至於美軍在公共租界擔任防務、如何分配一節、須由駐滬美陸戰隊司令官貝克上校決定、工部局與「市府」方面今晨對英軍退出上海事、皆無批評、駐滬美日兩國領署官員亦拒不發何評言、</p>
<p>日人方面信為機會</p>
<p>僅日人方面謂東京日外務省發言人今日或將發表言論、又本市日文「大陸新報」今晨載稱、駐上海與華北之英軍撤退後、本市英軍防區、應移交日當局、就目前「此間之確實局勢判斷」、此舉毫無問題、由於歐局益趨危急、英國迫不得已而激變其遠東政策、英軍撤退、無論以何種理由爲根據、要有一事必無疑義者、卽英當道已接受日方要求歐洲各交戰國撒退其駐中國淪陷區之武裝軍隊、以免發生不測事件是、</p>
<p>上海英軍部隊調查</p>
<p>字林西報云、駐華英軍懷念官西蒙斯少將昨（九日）夜正式宣布、現駐上海與華北之英軍行將撤退、倫敦英陸軍部亦已作同樣宣布、遵照此令而撒離上海·天津與北平之英軍、計爲（一）東塞萊聯隊第二大隊、卽現駐上海之正規大隊、（二）西福資高地隊第一大隊、常川駐香港、現暫駐此間、（三）陸軍醫藥團一支隊、其司令部現設中央路英軍醫院、（四）軍需運輸團一支隊、其司令部設阿煦兵營、（五）工兵信號憲兵及參謀團數支隊、其司令部設地豐路兵營、（六）陸軍付款團與牙醫團、</p>
<p>看護部份現亦在滬</p>
<p>英軍某軍官昨夜答覆記者問話稱、渠對西蒙斯少將所發公報、並無補充之言云、査駐華北英軍之行將撤離平津者、爲東塞萊聯隊第二大隊之一部份、　前駐華北之竇漢輕步兵隊調離後、該區英軍已减少、旋有東塞萊聯隊一中隊開往接防、此外、尙有附屬之軍事看護隊一部份、該隊現亦駐上海、</p>
<p>十三年來首次撤離</p>
<p>此次英軍離滬後、將為一九二七年來上海首次未駐英正規軍、在一九二七年以前、則除拳匪與洪楊兩亂外、上海並無久駐之英軍、往時曾駐上海之英軍著名聯隊、有庫爾斯屈里姆衛隊及蘇格蘭衛隊等、其中轉入工部局警務處服務者不乏其人、</p>
<p>駐滬軍官均負盛名</p>
<p>此次歐戰佛蘭特戰役時、任英遠征軍司令。現任英倫軍訓總監之葛特動爵、一九二七年間曾駐上海、任英軍夏福斯隊司令官鄧肯將軍之參謀長、英遠征軍從鄧扣克撤退時作戰有功而獲維多利亞十字勳章之依文安特魯上尉、亦曾隨東蘭開夏聯隊駐滬、現駐上海東塞萊隊指揮官爲史溫頓中校、西福資高地隊指揮官爲茂萊中校、西蒙斯少將、原係駐巴力斯坦英軍指揮官、旋調任駐華英軍司令、以繼調任古恩賽島總督（該島現被德軍佔據）之司馬萊德少將、</p>
<p>加強遠東英軍實力</p>
<p>據倫敦方面消息、行將撤離上海與華北之英軍、將用以加强駐遠東其他英軍之實力、按駐滬英軍擅長各種運動、允精於足球與曲棍球、</p>
<p>各國駐軍原有防區</p>
<p>北河南路以西蘇州河以南虞洽卿路以東之公共租界一帶、爲英軍及義勇軍區、極司非而路西南、蘇州河以南、凱旋路以東、陸家宅路以北、海格路以西之越界築路一帶爲英軍區、虞洽卿路以西、膠州路赫德路及極司非而路以東一帶之公共租界爲美軍區、膠州路赫德路以西、極司非而路以東、蘇州河以南公共租界之一部及西部越界築路之一部、爲義軍區、法租界則爲法軍區、北河甫路以東、蘇州河以北公共租界內及北部越界築路一帶爲日軍區</p>

<p>公共租界及法租界兩當局、爲「八一三」滬戰紀念在邇、確切維護界內治安起見、特宣佈舉行特種戒備、業於九日晨五時分別在山東路漢口路之申報館前。愛多亞路三洋涇橋泰晤士報館。大晚報館。中美日報館。愛多亞路長耕里中美日報印刷房弄口·外灘字林西報館前等處、均派大批小工、由警員監督堆置沙袋堡壘（半圓形）多座、分別派駐探捕及防軍駐守、嚴密保護、</p>

<p>字林報云、昨（九日）據航業界聲稱、日海軍當局對中國沿海航運所施禁止、或將於兩週內撤除一部份、査日方此項禁止、自七月十六日起實施、使中國沿海航運、除華北口岸與香港及上海間之直接航綫外、全吿阻斷、行駛此兩綫者、皆係大航運公司之船舶、故小公司實已停止營業、</p>
<p>軍事行動一部完畢</p>
<p>日當局曾解釋此項禁止爲軍事原因所必要、並以海軍集中對溫州·寗波。與鎭海等口岸有所行動、昨悉、若干口岸之軍事行動、現已完畢、故禁止或有早日撤消之可能、</p>
<p>商人損失已極浩大</p>
<p>航運公司因禁止沿、與本市經售沿海口岸土產之華商食物店所受損失相較、殊不足道、蓋本市所存紹與陳酒溫州火腿及華南各口岸之水菓、日趨减少、而未能進貨補足也</p>
<p>一說閩海擴充封鎖</p>
<p>又訊、駐華日本艦隊總司令島田繁少郞中將、於八月十日正午發表宣言、擴充福建沿海之封鎖範圍、謂基於作戰上之必要、曾於七月十五日發表宣言、禁止浙閩沿海多處地點船隻航行、（包括第三國家之船隻在內）茲再禁止下列閩海各地點之航行、自八月十五日零時起開始、其地帶自福建沿海之Kere　Island　Chimmo　Point經Highcone平海大岞角至深滬一綫結連、包括興化灣·平海灣·湄州浦·西浦·泉州港。深滬港·及其他海面在內、</p>
<p>滬輪公司未接確報</p>
<p>但英商怡隆公司探悉、該公司幷未接得此項消息、惟該公司於本月初旬由滬駛閩之神華神佑兩輪抵達興化之三江口後本定卽行返滬、而迄今猶無啟航消息、是吾被阻來滬、尙難得知査日方此次宣佈封鎖綫、（一）由杭州灣滸山起至沈家門垂直綫至菲山列島至象山港爵溪以上、封鎖綫係對於鎭海口方面、（二）由樂淸至前山至平陽以上、封鎖綫係對於甌江口方面、其封鎖區域甚廣、如沿浙東龍山。蟹浦·瀝港·鎭海·大榭山·穿山·岑港·象山港·杭州灣·六橫山。無不封鎖在內、其目的顯在阻斷航運而已、</p>

<p>昨爲「八一三」淞滬抗戰第三週紀念日前後警務當局實施戒備之第二日、各國防軍商團白俄隊及特別巡捕等、與警務處通力合作、維持秩序、自昨晚起、公共租界已增派巡捕在界內執行職務、萬國商團白俄隊已全部動員外、各項防禦措置、猶積極進行佈置、自今日起、戒備情形、將益臻嚴密、據悉、前昨兩日、參加戒備之防軍商團、僅爲一小部份、蓋召集之各團團員、如該團聯隊中華隊、集中於工部局大廈之商團營房、A字大隊則集中於跑馬廳內、B字大隊則集中於斜橋總會、惟自今晨五時起、所有集中待命之武裝團員、將一體出防、並已決定每二小時一班、輪流出防、而英美法義防軍出防數量、亦將較前昨兩日爲增、所有邊境以內之界內各要衝馬路交叉口、亦將增駐軍警戒備、</p>
<p>斷絕交通</p>
<p>昨日愛多亞路重慶路成都路等各不重要馬路、均佈置隙碍物封鎖、斷絕交通、英租界四川路。三茅閣橋·等沿虞洽卿路各通行處、均置鐵絲網架及警備車、並派駐大批中西探捕檢査行人、法租界敏體尼蔭路·東新橋·新北門。天主堂街。以迄外灘各路口、亦佈設障碍物及坦克車、並駐武裝探捕、大自嗚鐘斷絕交通、各國防軍亦仍繼續出動、分搭裝甲車或徒步巡行各街市間、此種嚴密戒備、將於十四日上午前撤消、惟臨時認爲必要時、或將延長、以維治安、</p>
<p>滬西戒備</p>
<p>公共租界當局以滬西爲罪惡淵藪、爲維持「八一三」紀念之安全起見、對於該區警備更見週密、昨據大光社記者乘車親赴該處視察結果、計大西路·地豐路·靜安寺路·極司非爾路。康腦脫路。膠州路。等路口、均堆置鐵絲網、旁駐探捕多名、對往來行人搜查綦嚴、並有意國防軍六七名、荷槍站立兩旁、同時有意防軍砲車往來巡邏、防範至爲週密、</p>

<p>工部局物價調查處頃發第二號公報雲、該處自發表第一號公報以後經處理之各項問題、其最重要者、厥為國產麵粉一項、查本局對於國麥運滬之種種方面、無權統制、因此小麥供應失常、結果租界內各大麵粉廠、大都減工、於是盤旋於每袋十四元之麵粉、漲至每袋十五元八角、且售價參差不齊、而多數麵包店復感採購為難、</p>
<p>改善粉市</p>
<p>為防止囤積以免續漲起見、本局曾經一度與各麵粉廠暨批發商號合作、商決供給正當需要之辦法、而其售價不得超過每袋十五元五角、實行以來、頗著成效、不意迄七月中旬，麵粉大感缺貨、各麵包店雖以每袋十六元至十六元三角之代價、僅獲日常需要之半數、於是本局復與協商、結果使一度發生極端恐慌之粉市、大見改善、目下國麥又有運滬、價亦較廉、粉價亦已跌至每袋十五元、以後可望繼續下降、</p>

<h3 id="c94">英能改取攻勢嗎 <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>關心歐戰的人現在都有一個疑問：就是希特勒對於英國如其不能發揮閃電戰，則英國是否能够對德採取攻勢？</p>
<p>英國方面原已由邱吉爾首相說明，不列顚的軍事計劃不僅限於防禦德軍的進攻。美國陸軍部長史汀生也曾說過，聯軍最大的失策，厥在當初決定採取被動政策。</p>
<p>目下英國所佈置的防務，規模之大實足驚人。英國軍事當局雖無時無刻不在等待德軍來犯，但同時至少已經採取一種暫時的攻勢。這在空軍方面尤其顯著。</p>
<p>數星期來，德國空軍固曾連續轟炸夾國，但英國空軍也正不斷的飛往德國襲擊。以言戰果，英國空軍部對於敵方所受損失雖不無誇大，對於本國被炸毀情形，雖不無掩飾之處，但據中立觀察家確實報吿，英機空襲德境的猛烈，實較德機爲甚。</p>
<p>至其原因，是否由於英機在去年冬問迭次深入德境偵察，致對於德境情形已瞭如指掌之故，抑係由於德軍航空隊員夜問擲彈不甚準確之故，現尙無法斷定。惟德機近來已實行白天空襲，似乎反證第二個的原因較近眞相。英幾近來亦已飛至敵方，如法比荷三國沿海飛行塲及德國各處，加緊攻勢。</p>
<p>海洋的控制權仍操於英國海軍。德國艦隊旣關閉在港內，義國艦隊亦不敢出而接戰，法國艦隊則匕解決了一大部份，法國的海岸且已被封鎖了。</p>
<p>但是這種情形畢竟是一種暫局。大規模攻勢的中動地位仍屬諸德國，而不屬於英國。英國海陸軍的佈防情形，現仍以取守勢爲主。空軍所取的攻勢亦不過是一種還擊，而非全面攻勢的前奏。</p>
<p>認淸當前形勢作率直的推斷：英國非至兩種準備工作完成之後，實無力採取攻勢。所謂兩種準備工作：第一須在空軍方面取得優勢，第二須急起直追充實摩托化大兵團，使其實力足以大規模的攻入敵境作戰。</p>
<p>先就空軍優勢一層而論，德軍以閃電戰術總攻比利時法蘭西時，聯軍以飛機數量的衆寡懸殊，以致潰敗至不可收拾，英各工廠近已能加緊製造，對於這種飛機數量上悲慘的劣勢，確已挽回了不少。至於戰鬥機及空軍戰士方面，英國仍保持着質的優勢。</p>
<p>次就機械化的配備而論，上月以來亦已同梯的加速製造，惟成績如何尙不得而知。所可確定者：英國在去歲九月間開戰時對於此層絕無準備，延誤至今年五月中旬始加緊製造，法蘭德斯一戰，又復損失殆盡，迄至目下，可說仍沒有充分的機械化配備，足以擔任攻勢。</p>
<p>因之，英國能吾改取攻勢這個問題的答案，一半繫於英國自身的努力，一半繫於美國及不列顚帝國各部份的接濟。英國的生產量如能不爲德機的連續轟炸所妨礙，則假以時日，英國自能造成大批飛機，戰車，大砲，及其他配備，以供採取攻勢之用。但是這種情形是不可能的。因之，英國在空軍及機械化部隊方面能吾取得優勢，美國及不列顚帝國各部份的接濟實爲決定的因素。</p>
<p>多數軍事專家一致承認，英國必須打破德國的空軍實力，始能派遣軍隊在敵前登陸作戰，目下的空軍襲擊及偶爾海戰是不能挽回戰局的。</p>
<p>惟據可靠消息，英國目下雖取守勢，但絕無意老是如此。英國軍事當局正在積極的佈置對德總攻計劃。陸相艾登素極主張採取攻勢，英國的參謀部及各軍將領也均熱烈的擁護他這種主張。所不可知者僅是時間問題而已。</p>
<h3 id="c95">史太林的承繼人柴達諾夫 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— r.L.</p>
<p>年來蘇聯共產黨公共集會塲上，我們常常看見獨裁者史太林的肩旁，坐着一位四十來歲的矮胖子，在一副滾圓的劃一不二的「羅宋」臉上，蓄着一撮短鬚。史太林對他很親熱，有時在他肩膀上拍拍，有時在他耳畔輕輕說上幾句話。共產黨領袖們「勞碌面相」的居多，這位圓臉的却是一種特色，他在公共塲合中所拍的照，總是顯着心廣體胖者的一副伶俐笑容。此人便是柴達諾夫Andrdy　Alexandrovich　Zadanov</p>
<p>在充滿神秘色彩，機詐莫測的克萊姆林宮中，共產黨獨裁者的每一舉動，無論對人講話或談笑，都含有重大的意義。然而要是有人問起，柴達諾夫究竟處着如何重要的地位，在莫斯科老練外國觀察家，除了隨便說一聲：「嗄，他是史太林副官」之外，也不知道他眞正的底細。直到最近，他們纔獲得了驚人的發現。原來柴達諾夫就是「史太林的承繼人，」至少已有四五年的歷史了。他是這位獨裁者所親封，而顯然又經過共產黨幹部所承認的。卽在目前史太林還活着的時候，這位「二號紅頭」——等於德國的「二號元首」戈林將事——在蘇聯政治舞台上，已大有操縱的力量。蘇聯是否將參加歐洲戰事，看來也要取決於他。因之歐洲各國的駐蘇使節，對於柴達諾夫的一言一動，無怪其要十二分注意了。</p>
<p>柴達諾夫之爲史太林的「嗣子」並未經過公佈。好像史太林一樣，他也不是蘇聯政府的基本官員。只就人與人的關係，和史太林左右人物的親疏比重而言，經過相當時間，和幾種特殊的徵象，纔發現了柴達諾夫的真實地位，和他前途的重要。史太林關於他的承繼人問題，最近也有意無意的要給人家知道，有時候特爲露些顏色。在陸軍學校舉行畢業禮時，舉酒稱觴時，大家只喊着史太林和柴達諾夫萬歲。柴達諾夫最近又被稱爲海軍一太上委員長」，好像史太林是紅軍「太上委員長」一樣。</p>
<p>除了這些表面的特徵外，柴達諾夫雖非蘇聯最高政治機構中的要員，他所握的實權却是超人一等。蘇聯除了「人民委員會」等最高機關外，在共產黨中尙有一個不容易看出來的統冶幹部，柴達諾夫在這幹部中，其地位的重要僅次於史太林而已。現在姑舉例而言，他是列寗格拉區黨部領袖，握有非常權力和光榮。依照共黨慣例，祇有獨裁者的承繼人纔可享受這種地位。柴達諾夫係於一九三四年列寗格拉區黨部前領袖基洛夫被殺後繼任該職的。大家回念往事，很明顯的知道，當時史太林之看待基洛夫不但爲他的知交，同時也是他當然的承繼人哩。</p>
<p>蘇芬之戰就是柴達諾夫所主持的。一九三九年夏，歐洲尚在和平空氣之中，柴達諾夫早就公然的說道：「蘇俄必須獲得芬蘭灣和北海的軍事據點，使得列寗格拉和茂孟斯克鐵道錢獲得安全保陣。」對芬的要求也是由他所起草，十一月間蘇芬談判失敗，都是他和史太林操縱的。戰事旣起，他「獨任艱鉅，」曾來往前綫，調度軍事。</p>
<p>柴達諾夫今年四十四歲，是個筋肉發達的中胖子，精神飽滿，富有活氣。每天工作常在十四至十五小時之間。他生於北俄的潑斯哥弗省。父親是一個窮困的敎堂小職員。他早年的身世，已不甚詳。上次歐戰起後卽輟學從戎，會獲帝俄十字聖喬奇勛章。一九一七年革命後，又會站在共黨方面參與內戰。他的入黨歷史並不悠久，直至內戰方畢，始在內黨工作。經十二年之久，始由「無名小卒」而進入共黨權貴的堂奧。</p>
<p>從一九一四到一九三一年，他在曠野田間從事眞正革命工作。不像別的革命領袖之在高堂大厦的軍事機關，或政府官舍中遙爲指揮。他目擊農民的革命，工人的掙扎，自己嘗到饑餓的痛苦，一切的一切都是身經體會的。如此才造就了他今日堅毅强固的個性。他對於列寗主義，不過爾爾。在他的心坎深處，倒是個以便宜爲上的機會主義者。他善於演說，一洗「老共產黨陳腐聒絮的」俗套術語，他以精警的言詞，包括活潑而共曉的意義。一方面，他的圓面笑臉上表示非常的樂觀；另一方面，他那尖銳的牙齒，粗大的拳頭，又代表蘇聯統治階級者的一種野蠻氣息。他給於靑年大學生以一種很好的印象，而使他們生出信任之念。蘇聯第一年革命時，那些不人道而可怕的措施，都由於他的努力而漸改善。</p>
<p>柴達諾夫所擔任的兩要職，共黨中央委員會副秘書長（秘書長卽係史太林）和最高議會外交委員會主席，使他對亽蘇聯的外交政策多所擘劃。蘇聯外交委員長莫洛托夫是他的好友，兩人合作，如虎添翼。他和許多「新進」的黨員一樣，是一個激烈的愛國主義及國家主義者，一反以國際為歸宿，或只重共產理論的，像托洛斯基，齊諾維夫諸老輩的作風。他從沒有住過外國，對於異邦勞働階級不感興趣。他的外交定律是一我國政府的外交政策，一以蘇聯人民的福利爲指歸，」他非所問。對芬作戰的動機亦基於此。一年前，國際主義派外交委員長李維諾夫的辭職，也出於他的排擠。一九三九年八月二十三日炸彈式的德蘇協定，也是柴達諾夫所促成</p>
<p>德蘇協定發動於一九三九年六月一十九日，當時柴達諾夫在報上發表言論，說英法對蘇談判「缺乏誠意」，無非挑撥德蘇使之作戰，蘇俄應停止談判，而與德國修好。到八月二十三日之後，倫敦和巴黎才知道史太林實在借了柴達諾夫的嘴在講話。嗣後對於這個「承繼人」便開始注意了。</p>
<p>柴達諾夫無所謂傾向英國，法國或德國，他祇傾向蘇俄。他嘗說，「英法希望蘇俄作戰但沒有一些好處給他，德國不叫他戰，卻給他一塊從前俄國的大土地。在這兩者之間取舍決定當然並不困難。」從此世人都知道柴達諾夫是一個敏銳的坦曰的國家主義派了。</p>
<p>史太林選擇柴達諾夫爲他「承繼人」的動機何在呢？</p>
<p>這位「紅黨獨裁者」今年已屇六十一歲高齡，他的身體，據說很強健，但是他飽經憂患，艱險頻歷，非常人所得而知的，恐怕他在世之日已不能甚久了。同時他的左右，莫洛托夫，伏洛希洛夫，受特萊亞夫，對於史太林承繼人的人選，也極盼望着，早些安排。</p>
<p>萬一史太林死而無「後」，萬一大家爭奪這個空着的「寳座一，這些人不但將蒙到極大的危險，恐怕連他們的性命也將不保呢。誠然，十七年前列寗沒有承繼人而就逝世，便鑄了個大錯。經過了長時期的紛爭，太太林攫取了他的「王位」。其他諸人如齊諾維夫，加米納夫，及勃加林等，幾乎全都成爲史太林的仇人，而被執行槍決了。而且現在顯著的現象，要是史太林撤手西歸之時，尚還後繼無人，那麼目前就可生出種種猜忌攘奪的陰謀，甚至把他自己的地位都弄糟了</p>
<p>史太林有一個已經長成的兒子，以工程師爲錄，爲離婚的前妻所出。父子間感情極壞，這個兒子所住的地方，離莫斯科極遠，從不與他的父親見面。史太林的後妻，亞麗柳弗去世已數年，生有子女各一，但均未成年。承繼史太林的勢必是一個成熟精壯而又具有魄力的男子。</p>
<p>柴達諾夫無疑的是個上選人物。據說在他三十歲的時候，史太林見到這個小夥子後，便很喜悅他。歷年以來在史太林歷年消黨運動中，柴達諾夫均能表示忠貞堅定，對於肅淸列寗格拉區內的反動份子，出力尤鉅。但說也奇怪，他的寃家却並不多。他不像其他共黨領袖的曾殺死許多人，他做人之道很是中正和平，又能協調於各派之間。他雖已結婚，而律己甚嚴，並沒有人對他說短道長。因爲他單純的俄國人風格，和不妥協的國家主義，在海陸紅軍之中，大爲人所愛戴</p>
<p>惟柴達諾夫的身份地位並未經史太林向衆正式宣佈，誠然，在公衆尙未獲悉其底細之前，如果柴達諾夫對於他的獨裁者有所陰謀時，史太林便可不聲不響的把他「除去」了。</p>
<p>柴達諾夫的命運將怎樣呢？充任史太林的承繼人是到處荊棘，危險重重的。這位獨裁者史太林天生多疑。眞所謂一伴君如伴虎」，跟他在一起，結果如何還難預測。</p>

<h3 id="c97">基督的自動犧牲（一） <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>我們一提起耶穌就會想到他是被釘十字架而死的。論他一生的道德，眞是空前絕後的一位千古完人。我們想到他這樣的慘死，誰都要一掬傷心之淚。但在耶穌自己却說一沒有人奪我的命去，是我自己捨的。」如此說來，他的苦死，乃是自動犧牲的了。他這樣的自動犧牲，與我們有甚麼敎訓呢？</p>
<p>（一）要敎訓我們甚麽是愛：我們在這裏不是要爲愛下定義，，也不是爲愛立對象，更不是說愛的範圍有多少限制，乃是要講人因爲愛，到底能做多少事？愛的極點，如同耶穌的愛，就爲我們甘心捨命。（允翰一36）詩人感覺到人的渺小，曾經設，人算甚麽？」人眞算不得甚麽！尤其是犯罪作惡的人，更算不得甚麽！入能高得比天使還高，稱之爲聖，稱之爲神，但也能墮落到不如萬物的地位。上帝的兒子——耶穌，甘心爲「算不得甚麽」的人，犧牲十架，豈不是叫我們知道上帝的愛嗎？</p>
<p>（二）要敎訓我們甚麽是眞友誼：耶穌從前對他的門徒說：「你們要彼此相愛像我愛你們一樣，這就是我的命令。人爲朋友捨命，人的愛心沒有比這個更大的了…」（允翰十五12）古人有話說「得一知己，死亦無憾」。可見人類皆有嚶鳴求友的情緒。同時我們又常知道人們要想得一個知己的朋友，也是很難。至於爲朋友捨命的刎頸交，更是少有。世，人皆需要朋友，如果得不着人做朋友，他必要把飛鳥走獸以及花草樹木，當作知己，使其情有所寄託。像那「梅妻鶴子」的林和靖，便是一個很好的例證。不過世界上可以當作朋友的一切—為獸花木音樂書籍等，終不能永久不離開人，而且朋友之間，也少有眞肯爲朋友犧牲的。惟有耶穌愛世人，以世人爲朋友，而爲朋友捨命。（待八月十四日再續）讀者欲知詳細，請函詢上海愛文義路三五一號文字布道社，當有詳細答覆。</p>

<p>— 王滄萍</p>
<p>愛好游戲是兒童的天性，同時亦是他們應享的權利，可是在這孤島上，他們的權利是被剝奪了，住着鴿籠似的房子，不要說游戲，連痛快的活動，亦被限制了，多數的學校，連天井亦做了課堂，還要搭擱樓，課餘的活動，只好像走馬燈似的亂轉，新鮮的日光和空氣，他們是離得很遠。星期日原是他們的好日子，公園中去逛逛，亦可以疏散疏散呆滯的手脚，可是有許多家長們爲着電車公共汽車都已漲價，還要去買門票，單單柴米油　的幾項開支，已經壓得透不轉氣來，對於這種游戲明知有益亦只好省省，於是一般兒童，終年受不到大自然的恩惠的，亦是很多。筆者爲彌補這種缺憾起見，且把理想中的兒童福利事業臚列於下：</p>
<p>有私人花園的，和規模較大的學校有較大的體育園地的，可規定每星期幾天出借給沒有運動塲的各小學學生，作爲運動的塲所，（不過這對於有土地佔有慾的業主們大都不肯接受這種請求應該設法疏通普遍）籌設兒童圖書館，由各界熱心人士，籌募基金，依據各人力量而定，規模之大小，並無關係，總之圖書館是多多益善，但圖書之選擇，須請專家担任，最好在閱書室的一隅，添設兒童娛樂室，則讀書之後，可以游戲，精神與身體，都得到愉快的滿足。再由每個圖書館每年舉行兒童作品展覽會若干次，促淮兒童好學興趣。</p>
<p>提倡兒童電影，我認爲一樣賺錢，只要電影廠的老闆，請幾個深知兒童心理的編導，從事兒童電影的攝製，取材一定很多，而且營業決不會少，因爲天下無不是之父母，孩子的要求，父母決不會故意吝嗇的。</p>
<p>各大公司努力製造敎育玩具，須具啟發智識，引人入勝的條件，而取利切勿過厚，則銷行必暢，仍收薄利多賣之效，無綫電台，多講兒童故事，取材方面，如戚繼光岳飛司馬光等等，以歷史爲根據，不妨各出心裁，用深入顯出的技巧，加上許多興趣濃厚的穿揷，這種故事，便是婦女亦很愛聽。</p>
<p>還可利用電台，舉行兒童演講競賽，激發兒童思想，組織兒童食品產銷合作社，因兒童食品，大都向街頭小販購買，與衛生殊有妨碍，合作社出品，以淸潔，營養，廉價，爲三大要件，僱用窮苦的難童，穿着制服，携着食盒，在沿街沿弄兜售，供應全市兒童所需新鮮的食物，其組織法可由專家訂定之。以上數點，雖是筆者的理想，可是在健全的社會裏，確有具備的必要，上海不乏熱心人士，尙望奮起倡導，爲此輩枯燥呆頓的兒童，開闢快樂的園地，來培養他們的精神，增進他們的生活，此誠社會的幸福，亦是國家的幸福。</p>
<h3 id="c99">一個聰明的老人 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— 赤耳</p>
<p>從前有一個老人，在一條狹而長的小徑上走，徑旁都有河流，徑上滿生着叢草，他手中拿了一根旱烟筒，一隻旱烟袋及一匣火柴，邊走邊吸，很爲得意：不料他將一根燃着的火柴梗，丟在地上，草是乾燥的，一着了火就燃起來了，並且蔓延得很快，他見了就趕快地向前奔，但是後面的火勢，因有順風的助威，竟向他跟着來了。他當時急得走頭無路，兩旁又都是河流，不能跳下去，後面的火勢又來得緊，祇嚇得他拚命價的朝前跑，跑了不多時，忽然給他想起了凡事總得鎭靜地做去，否則好似飛蛾撲火，自取滅亡；於是他竭力則鎭靜頭腦，壓住慌急的態度，努力的運用頭腦，結果，果眞給他想起了一個萬全的法子來了。他趕忙把火柴點了一根，丟在前面的乾草上，前面的草着了火也燃燒起來，他就跟若前面的火勢跑，這樣，他後面的火燒不着他了。」</p>
<p>小朋友，你們看了這樣的故事，一定異口同聲地說：「這個老人聰明極了！」並且都很佩服他的足智多謀，但是一個人如果遇到什麼難事，一些也不慌張？能够鎮靜地想出法子來應付環境，那末沒有不成功的。試看前面的故事，若不是老人想出一個良好的方法，怎能不被火燒死呢，所以祗是空急而不去想法是沒有用的。</p>
<p>小朋友！我勸你們大家不要遇事慌張，應該鎭靜，因爲祗是慌張，是自取滅亡的路啊</p>
<h3 id="c100">颶風 <a href="#c100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— 蘇明</p>
<p>近幾天來，報紙上刊載着關於颶風的消息「太平洋上起一颶風，風勢相當猛烈，向西北西方向疾進中，上海是否被撲襲，天文台於密切注意中，並警吿航海船……」庸兒看到了這段消息，一知半解。「爲什麼颶風像太平洋上的特產」？去問哥哥宗兒。</p>
<p>「在回答你這個問題前，你可知道風是怎樣發生的？而颶風是風的一種，於是你所問的問題亦可解決了」。庸兒待宗兒說完了，便搖了搖頭表示他不知道。</p>
<p>「空氣流動便成風，但是空氣怎麽會流動呢？這完全是空氣壓力的不同而產生，因爲一部分空氣受到了溫度增高的影響而變得很輕，而其附近的空氣不受到熱，便較重，於是沉下來，把輕的空氣壓上去，因此發生空氣的循環，以致空氣流動，就有了風。把扇子搖搖，便有風，那是人造風，而其理由都是一樣的。自然風的成因氣壓的改變所致，那麼氣壓爲什麼能改變呢？當燒一根木柴的時候，就可以看到火星一直向上，這種現象因被燒熱的空氣，受熱便膨脹而輕，於是發生上引的趨向，再由四周冷而重的空氣來補足，那便成了風。譬如日間立在海邊，只覺到那風是從海上吹來的，因爲陸地上的空氣比水上的空氣來得容易受熱，所以日間地上的空氣便向上昇，由海上吹來的空氣來補足。還有一種是空氣的渦流所致，那是因爲太陽熱而使地面發熱，於是局部的使氣壓發生變化，從四周流來的空氣形成了渦流，這眞像把手在水盆裏很快的旋轉，那水便成了漩渦，中心很凹，所以愈近中心，壓力亦愈小，那渦流的情况恰和這一樣，不過空氣變了水罷了。這渦流的塲所雖改變，而仍打着旋。風的大小就是以渦流的四圍和中心的氣壓的比較而定，要是渦流中心的氣壓比四周來得低，這叫低氣壓，如果比四周來得高，那叫高氣壓·低氣壓和高氣壓並不固定在一處，而次第的向前移動，速度和火車的速度相似，但是高氣壓較慢。低氣壓一來，那便要下雨，高氣壓一到，便發生下降氣流，空氣就降近地面，水氣上昇而消滅，天便晴了，氣候也感到寒冷。假使低氣壓過大，就發生暴氣，而颶風就是低氣壓達到最大的程度，這種低氣壓最易發生在太平洋和南洋羣島一帶，而且它發生的時期亦有一定，總是在七八九三個月中，颶風所行的路程大都是成橢圖形式，所以我國東部的幾省和日本常受到颶風的打擊，損失當然是很大的」。</p>

<p>他們都是我的愛人，都是我所愛的——然而爸爸却要除外，因爲他是我最早而最愛的人啊。他如今是很快樂的了；但他先前也有不快樂的時候。記得最初我在短片中工作時，曾聽得媽媽對人家說，我在每一部短片中所得的酬報，不過四五十圓罷了。我的收人旣少，而爸爸所工作的銀行中，又來了一個　消息。他老人家並不和我說明是會麼一回事，但我聽得他和媽媽所說的話。瞧了他的臉色，就知道這消息是很壞很壞的。終於有一天他躲在家裏，不上銀行去了。向來除了禮拜日，他決不會躲在家裏的，這是第一次發見的怪事。我問他為什麼不出去？他說羅斯福總統命令所有的銀行一律停業，所以他不能再去工作了。</p>
<p>那時我們坐在聖馬尼加老屋的花園裏，我已記不得是那一天，只記得決不是禮拜日罷了。可甘，我也不知道是什麼原因，除了禮拜日外，園子裏總是冷淸淸的。我和爸爸坐在我所頑要的小木屋外一張板凳上，他一面孔透露着不高興的神情，他自己也不知道怎樣才好。我心中很是不安，決意要逗得他高興起來。我正待爬到爸爸膝蓋上去，說：爸爸我非常的愛你。　但是這當兒媽媽恰從屋子裏走出來，忙着說時候不早，我們立刻要上攝影塲去了。於是我們走上了爸爸的汽車，他老人家就送我們上攝影塲去。我坐在他們二老之間，一路上也沒有什麽話說。直到我們到了攝影塲門前，我和媽媽下了車，爸爸才很勉强的對我微微一笑，開口說：他雖沒有事情做，然而鄧波兒一家中，至少有一個人在工作哩！呀，他老人家那裏想到這一年的耶穌聖誕節，好運就要降臨到我們的頭上，要是預先知道，他就得快樂非常了。</p>
<p>可甘，原來幾個月後，我被派主演一部偉大的影片了：演成之後，我也像珍妮甘諾，葛萊泰嘉寳一樣，成了一個好萊塢的大明星！</p>
<p>我來吿知你這件事的經過，先前原也有許多人問過我的。他們說：「兩年以前，從沒有人聽得過秀蘭鄧波兒的名字，你到底從什麼地方突然跳出來的？」其實我的出來，也不能算是突然，我已在短片中辛苦工作了一個時期，成名也不是容易的。</p>
<p>爸爸自從銀行關閉失了業之後，過了不久，媽媽就得到一個消息，我們不再攝製那一種本頭短片的「嬰兒把戲」了。導演對伊說，我們已製成了七部，可是觀衆並不歡迎，沒有「頑童滑稽片一那麽受人歡迎，所以成績平平，况且孩子們都漸漸長大，也不配嬰兒了。</p>

<p>— 清暉</p>
<p>影　影星羣裏，目前地位之高，聲譽之隆，沒有誰再比得上瑙瑪希拉了。她曾經連握了三年藝術學院的獎章（一九三六年演「閨怨」，一九三七年演「鑄情」，一九三八年演「絕代艷后」，）眞是銀色世界的一顆彗星！她生於一九〇四年八月十一日，今天恰恰是三十六歲誕辰。十五歲時，她和母親姊妹三人同赴紐約，在那裏躑躅了半年之久，依然毫無成就，三人囊空如洗，會有一影片公司招請十二名臨時演員，她們趕去應徵，可喜都被錄用，工作一天可得五元，那時炭精尙未發明，靠陽光拍戲，所以陰天她們就成了失業者。</p>
<p>兩度失敗</p>
<p>不久以後，她得到環球公司經理歐文泰爾白（Irving　Thalberg）的垂靑，允爲簽訂長期合同，後歐文忽父電報來召，說是一部片子的主角抱病，於是瑙瑪又碌碌二次奔赴紐約，　知當她趕到時，那主角竟痊愈了，於是瑙瑪又吿失業。那時，她會一度當過藝術家的模特兒，但這究竟不是正業，後來她得到一個機會馬上就獻身於舞臺，慢慢的受到歡迎，不久她更獲得美女競賽的冠軍，遂由此頭銜在一九二〇年正式踏上銀幕，與米高梅簽訂五年合同，每星期一百元。這樣她由小角而配角而主角，終至被譽爲「銀幕上的首席女星」（First　Lady　of　the　Screen）</p>
<p>舉行婚禮</p>
<p>在瑙瑪到好萊塢的三週年，歐文忽邀她到他家廛吃飯，這是他倆第一次的表示，自此以後，他們的熱度與日俱增，直至一九二八年九月二十九日，便快樂地舉行了婚禮。一九三六年九月十四日，歐文因肺炎而逝世，她的家庭快樂遂宣吿破產，一九三八年，又東山再起。</p>
<p>新羅曼史</p>
<p>後來，她又開始新羅曼史，她的鄰居小范朋克和她一度過從甚密，後小范朋克到倫敦去，她只好向詹姆史蒂華追求；現在史蒂華正追求奧麗薇哈佛蘭，而小范朋克也結婚了，瑙瑪在失望之餘，又和喬治賴甫打得火熱。瑙瑪近日的情形十分幽閑自得。除了和喬治賴甫在一起外，其餘的時間，大都消耗在她的兒女身上，她有一個十歲的兒子叫歐文環，一個五歲的女兒叫凱絲玲。她的母愛精神十足，閒時敎他們讀拉丁文，並且用種種方法使他們快樂。</p>
<h3 id="c104">今日上海電影界分析　所謂「兩大陣綫」及其他 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— 海星</p>
<p>談今日之中國電影界者，謂可分爲兩大陣綫，其一以張善琨爲領導，包括新華華新華成之三廠發行主任吳邦藩，卞毓英，李大深，聯美之沈犬蔭，美成之顏鶴嗚，藝華似亦可列入此一陣綫中，蓋今日導演演員，十九爲張氏之國聯所羅致，因此聯美等爲攝製上或發行上的便利計，與張氏同進退都有必要，至于行將遷滬之南粵公司，亦難逃此例，不其然者，至少人力上將大成問題，另一陣綫，在表面上似爲國華與金星，其實此兩家之關係，不過同在一處攝製，以及若干職演員可以通用而已，最主要的出品之質的一端——製作方針，可謂截然不同，蓋從金星當局幾决談話中，知將另闢蹊經，日後與國聯等並無衝突可能——例如雙包案。金星與民華，則頗彷彿似之，蓋都別有懷抱者。民華之態度，可以費穆導演之處世方式說明之，不尙多言，埋頭苦幹，是非曲直，留待世人公斷。至于專攝「文素臣」之合衆，則又是一種態度，經濟比較寬裕，一若滿不在乎者，觀乎合衆主人吳性栽之長期供養英茵，並不急于談及工作一端，則記者之言，或非過甚甚其詞。</p>
<p>總之，所謂兩大陣綫者，實則亦不過國聯一系與國華一家而已。以人力物力論，國華自難與前者頡頏，惟國華之柳氏昆仲，亦是幹材，頗有一爭高下之勢，至于民華合衆金星，則志不在此，不能列入任何一種陣綫中。</p>

<p>霍桑在電話中的問答，已足够使我覺得緊張，可是這時候竟另有一種出我意外的緊張，使這件案子得到一種急劇的開展。霍桑打電話時，他的眼光仍時常從電話間的玻璃上向外面溜轉。我站立的地位，在電話間鬥口，面向着霍桑，背向着那旅館出入的通道。我忽見霍桑的眼光突然一閃，接着閃電似地舉起他的左手，向我的背後一指。我瞧見他這種緊張狀態，當然來不及發問，急忙旋轉頭去，看見一個西裝男子的背形，正急步向電梯間走去。我在這間不容髮的時間，便放開脚步盲目地追隨上去。那男子離開我有五六步路，他走到電梯間門前的時候，辨兩扇乳白漆的鋼門剛要拉攏。他把身子一側，揷了進去，鋼門便合攏了。我奔到門口時，電梯已在綏緩兒上升！我急急用拳頭在鋼門上亂敲，抬頭瞧了，上面的指示針剛才離開了「一」，忽又停住了退回來，鋼門重新開放，讓我進去</p>
<p>我踏進電梯的時候，暗暗地舒了一口氣，心頭還卜卜亂跳。但我的外貌上不能不裝作鎭靜的樣子。我暗忖霍桑那個緊張的信號，一定有重大的關係。他分明瞧見了什麼人，自己來不及追踪，故而忽促他叫我代勞。那末，他瞧見的是誰？不會是趙伯雄罷？（七二）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japan Increasingly Eyes Vietnam; French Troops Conduct Naval Exercises; British Newspaper Claims French Government Will Succumb to Japanese Demands; Nishihara Flies Back to Hanoi with New Instructions from Japanese Government <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The diplomatic correspondent for the London Daily Mail claims that the Pétain government is expected to succumb to Japan's demands regarding Vietnam within the next few days. The main demands are to build naval and military bases in Vietnam and to use the country as a passage to attack Yunnan. Japan views this as a political method, and it is undoubtedly a preliminary plan for a military occupation and eventual annexation of the entire country of Vietnam. Although Japan has not yet officially presented an ultimatum, it has informally hinted that it will resort to force if France does not yield. The German and Italian governments may advise General Pétain to quickly comply with Japan's demands. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>A dispatch from London this morning in the Daily Telegraph states that the French Asian fleet is conducting exercises in Vietnamese waters. It is widely believed that this news demonstrates a hardening of the French authorities' attitude towards Japanese demands. However, British sources believe that this is merely a precautionary measure and will not immediately lead to serious consequences. (International News Service, 10th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to semi-official Japanese sources, Major General Nishihara, leader of the Japanese inspection mission to Vietnam, returned to Hanoi yesterday with instructions from Tokyo. It is expected that Nishihara, after receiving a report on the progress of negotiations between the Japanese inspection mission and the Vietnamese authorities, will meet with Governor-General Decoux of Vietnam to accelerate the negotiations based on the Tokyo instructions he brought back. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>French and Japanese to Continue Negotiations</p>
<p>Hanoi: Major General Nishihara, the Japanese supervisor in Vietnam, returned here yesterday from the east by plane. He was accompanied by a certain secretary from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The plane arrived at 2:30 PM. It is said that Major General Nishihara has received new instructions from Tokyo and may reopen negotiations with the Vietnamese authorities within a few days. The contents of the Japanese government's instructions to Nishihara are unknown. According to Japanese sources here, Nishihara's return should dispel the fears of the French that Japan is preparing to use military force against Vietnam, as Nishihara's return indicates Japan's intention to continue friendly negotiations with the Vietnamese authorities. (United Press, 10th)</p>
<p>Hanoi: Due to the return of Major General Nishihara, the Japanese supervisor, to Hanoi, the tense situation in Vietnam has eased. It is rumored that Japan and the Vietnamese authorities are expected to continue friendly negotiations. (United Press International, 10th)</p>
<p>Vichy: French Foreign Minister Baudouin recently discussed Japan's demands regarding Vietnam with Japanese Ambassador to France, Sawada. French sources say that the talks are focused on the mutual interests of the two countries and are currently underway. (United Press, 10th)</p>
<p>China Hopes France Will Form an Alliance to Resist Aggression</p>
<p>Chongqing: Chinese newspapers have recently been advising the French government to form a military alliance with the Chongqing government to jointly defend Vietnam. Local newspapers have also unanimously warned that, regardless of France's decision, the Chinese government will resist any Japanese aggression against Vietnam. Chinese newspapers have also prominently published an unconfirmed report stating that the French government has decided to resist Japanese military pressure. The Xinmin Daily stated that if France requests our assistance in defending its colonies, we will not hesitate to provide all possible assistance. The newspaper also stated that France should join hands with China to defend Vietnam against Japan. If France does not take this reasonable measure, we will not hesitate to fulfill our obligation to defend Vietnam by force. We will never allow the Japanese to occupy Vietnam, because if the Japanese occupy Vietnam, they will undoubtedly launch attacks against the Chinese mainland from there. The influential Ta Kung Pao expressed great welcome to the unconfirmed report (namely, the news that France had decided to resist Japanese aggression against Vietnam). "A large number of Chinese troops have already been stationed on the Vietnamese border. These troops can be a powerful reinforcement to the Vietnamese defense forces. Japan is well aware of its own weakness, so it is still hesitating about whether to take military action against Vietnam. Countries with vested interests in the Pacific, such as Germany, Britain, and the United States, are prepared to inflict a major blow on Japan if it seizes the opportunity of France's defeat to seize French colonies. If France decides to adopt a policy of resistance, then it can be said that it has grasped the key to success." (United Press, 10th)</p>
<p>Traffic Obstructions, Goods Piled Up in Warehouses</p>
<p>Hong Kong: The Hong Kong Daily recently reported that a certain company formerly purchased a large batch of goods from foreign countries on behalf of the Chinese government. Due to traffic obstructions, these goods cannot be transported to the Chinese mainland and are piled up in warehouses here, with a total value of no less than several million dollars. The companies concerned are planning to resell these goods, and one of them has already entered into negotiations with an American manufacturer, willing to return the goods to the original owner. (Havas Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>Manila: It was learned here yesterday that twenty American warplanes, along with a large quantity of explosives, artillery shells, and other military equipment, are being temporarily stored in Manila until the滇缅公路 (Burma Road) is reopened, as orders have been received from the Chinese government. The American authorities have no involvement in the storage of war materials here. These materials will be transported to China as soon as the road is available.

<p>Laohekou: A twelve-member comfort mission from all walks of life in Anhui, led by mission leader Chen Xiannang, departed from the Dabie Mountains and, after traversing for more than ten days, arrived here on the 10th. The local military and civilians gathered at the station to warmly welcome them. According to Chen Xiannang, Anhui Province has implemented a unified party, military, and political policy in recent years, with extremely rapid progress.

<p>Chongqing: At 2:40 PM today, ninety Japanese bombers in three waves raided Chongqing. The bombed area was quite wide, extending from the north bank of the Jialing River to the south bank of the Yangtze River, with bombs falling in seven locations and causing fires. However, the estimated number of casualties is less than one hundred. The fires in other locations were extinguished three hours after the bombing, but the large fire at a tung oil factory on the south bank of the Yangtze River has not yet been extinguished. Several bombs fell around the banking area, but none of Chongqing's major modern bank buildings were hit, except for some damage to the stone wall facade of the Juxingcheng Bank. The YMCA building was directly hit and suffered heavy damage. The situation on the south bank is currently unclear. Recalling that just a few days ago, the Chinese authorities warned citizens not to take refuge on the south bank during air raids, explaining that Japan's guarantee that the south bank had been recognized as a safe area was unreliable.

<p>Hong Kong: The Hong Kong Daily recently reported that the city has been greatly affected since the evacuation of women and children, especially for stores selling children's and women's clothing, especially fashion boutiques. However, stores selling Chinese women's clothing and Indian silk stores still maintain a large number of customers. Generally speaking, business in July decreased by 30% compared to before. As for restaurants and hotels, business has actually increased because women have left and men have to eat out. However, most domestic helpers have lost their jobs, and jewelry and antique stores have also been affected, relying solely on foreign tourists to maintain business. In addition, bookstores originally thought that since women and children had been evacuated, business could greatly increase due to the general loneliness of men, but this is not the case and they are quite disappointed.

<p>Chongqing: The American branch of the World Student Association dispatched two representatives, Burke and Coryess, to China to understand the latest situation in the Far East. Burke was stranded in Hong Kong due to illness, while Coryess arrived in Chongqing from Kunming a few days ago. Song Ruhai, a representative of the Chinese branch of the World Student Association, gave a dinner party for him at Guanshengyuan tonight. Coryess is a second-year student at the Union Theological Seminary in New York, 25 years old. He departed from the United States and traveled through Japan, Korea, Manchuria, Peiping, Jinan, Shanghai, Nanking, Hong Kong, and Kunming before arriving in Chongqing. After the dinner, Coryess shared his observations along the way, stating that Japan is experiencing a severe shortage of various raw materials, such as rubber, leather, cotton yarn, and matches, which have become scarce items. When he passed through Korea, his request to see six American Methodist school students imprisoned by the Japanese was rejected. Coryess mentioned that students in Peiping were frequently arrested by the Japanese authorities. Coryess only stayed in Nanking for a few hours.

<h3 id="e11">British Troop Withdrawal <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>The British War Office formally announced the day before yesterday, that is, September 9, that the British troops currently stationed in Shanghai and North China will be withdrawn and transferred to other locations. It should be noted that there is no fixed number of British troops stationed in China. Currently, there are 50 troops stationed in Peiping, 120 in Tianjin, and in Shanghai, in addition to three battalions, there are medical teams, nursing teams, transportation teams, engineering teams, service teams, and military police, totaling 1,570 officers and soldiers, with a complete organization and full equipment. The troops in the three locations are under the command of Major General Simmons. It is said that the departure date is next week; however, what the British War Office announced only stated that they would be withdrawn, without a definite time limit; and whether this withdrawal is due to military strategic considerations remains to be discussed, as the original intention of their presence in Shanghai and Tianjin was not based on military strategy. Military-strategic deployments are quickly withdrawn, while non-military deployments must wait for careful consideration and determination of the timing outside of military strategy. As for Shanghai, the situation is complex; the British troops stationed in Shanghai have a local international mission from the day they were stationed, so their withdrawal, although imperative due to their homeland's military orders, requires consultation and clear handover regarding the international mission. Therefore, whether the departure will take place next week is uncertain.</p>
<p>The British decision to withdraw troops from China is sudden. Judging from the matter itself, there are four points to recognize: First, British troops were stationed in China in 1899 during the Boxer Rebellion in Zhili and Shandong. The following year, the Allied forces captured Peking, and in 1901, the Boxer Protocol was signed. This is the treaty basis for the troop deployment. It concerns rights under the treaty, and rights exist as long as the treaty is in effect. It also concerns the joint action of the Allied forces, and there are mutual relations between the countries involved. Therefore, while withdrawing its troops, Britain declared that its treaty rights were still retained and notified the relevant countries at the same time. The connections here must be clearly understood. Second, troop deployment is only one aspect of treaty rights. Other rights based on the treaty also rely on the treaty for protection, not on the strength of the stationed troops. Third, treaty rights are not measured by the number of troops stationed or not, that is, the increase or decrease of stationed troops has nothing to do with other rights under the treaty, and it is not a symbol of the rise and fall of authority and power. Fourth, the British withdrawal of troops is based on the orders of its War Office, which has nothing to do with the British Navy. How the Far East Fleet will be dispatched and arranged after the army withdraws should be an object of attention in the future; in other words, Britain still has military force in the Far East, namely the navy.</p>
<p>The four points listed above are a very simple and clear explanation. Why did Britain suddenly take this action? Modern warfare is large-scale, requires sufficient strength, and precise calculations. Therefore, those who preside over military and national affairs internally and those who control the front and rear lines externally will not waste a single soldier or weapon. They cherish them, make good use of them, and strive for practical benefits. Britain is engaged in war against Germany and wants to concentrate all its strength for military strategic reasons, unwilling to have 1,740 soldiers linger in China for a long time. Indeed, if such a number is placed in a place where they cannot exert their strength, they can be annihilated in an instant; if they are used properly, they can also hold two or three strongholds and stand alone; weighing the importance and urgency, it is more advantageous to transfer them to other locations for service. What the British War Office announced contains no explanation of this kind. Is it that this explanation is the most dignified? Regardless of whether Britain will make an explanation on this or not, and regardless of whether it will explain it this way, given the close and complex relationship between Britain and the Far East, and the chaotic and muddled state of affairs in the Far East, with unpredictable brewing and evolution, it is insufficient to explain the troop withdrawal solely on the basis of the above-mentioned wartime military strategic reasons. The speculations of various parties are also divergent. Some say that Britain is using the troop withdrawal to indicate a compromise with Japan. However, Anglo-Japanese compromise cannot be established unless Britain withdraws from the Far East. The troop withdrawal cannot be regarded as a sign of withdrawal from the Far East, nor can it win Japan's favor; moreover, judging from the form and timing of the troop withdrawal, Britain has neither indicated acceptance of Japan's proposal for European belligerents to withdraw their troops stationed in China, nor has it used this as a subject for diplomatic negotiations; and compared with other recent British actions toward Japan, the compromise theory is hardly credible. Some say that Britain is using the troop withdrawal as a preparation for a tough stance against Japan. However, Britain's interests in Shanghai and Tianjin are considerable and cannot be protected by the strength of more than a thousand soldiers; but it would not be considered excessive to sacrifice those soldiers for the sake of those considerable interests; moreover, there are many ways to take a firm stance against Japan, the time for a break between Britain and Japan is still far away, and it is difficult for the British expatriates in Shanghai and Tianjin to evacuate. So why is the troop withdrawal easier and even comes first? Therefore, it is also unconvincing to say that this is a shift towards a tougher stance. Both are unlikely. In our speculation, Britain is aware of the difficulties it faces and is urgently seeking to strengthen the defenses of Hong Kong, Burma, Singapore, and other places. In addition, it is fortifying its defenses and clearing the fields, in order to gain the greatest freedom of action. The criteria for Britain's freedom of action and choices are: the strength of the German offensive, first; the intensity of Japanese pressure, second; and the international attitude of the United States and the situation of China's resistance, which are also major factors in its decision-making.</p>
<h3 id="e12">British Withdrawal of Troops from China: American Position Unaffected; Three Actions Taken to Remedy Regret; Whether to Take Over British Defense Zone Undecided <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Acting Secretary of State Welles stated here yesterday that although British troops in Shanghai are being withdrawn, the U.S. Marine Corps will, at least for the time being, remain stationed in Shanghai. Welles said that the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai numbers about 1,000, and the decision to maintain these troops is entirely the judgment and responsibility of the U.S. government. However, the U.S. government has not yet decided whether the U.S. Navy will take over the defense zone vacated by the British troops in Shanghai. Welles, in elaborating on the British withdrawal from China, reiterated that the U.S. government is prepared, "under appropriate circumstances," to abandon its right to station troops in China and other extraterritorial rights. Welles continued that the British action cannot currently change any aspect of U.S. policy. Senior officials here view the British troop withdrawal as damaging to British prestige but feel that this regret has been remedied by the following three U.S. actions in the Far East: (1) the U.S. improving relations with the Soviet Union; (2) the U.S. controlling export transportation, indirectly affecting Japan; and (3) the U.S. Senate including the Philippines within the region where national defense forces can be dispatched "for training." It is generally believed here that the withdrawing British troops will still be stationed somewhere in the Far East, most likely Hong Kong. Therefore, it is believed that the British withdrawal cannot be regarded as reducing British military strength in the Far East. Some well-informed sources believe that the improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations in recent days has compensated for British laxity in East Asia. Senior congressional leaders stated that, regardless of the British attitude, the U.S. does not intend to reduce or withdraw its troops stationed in China. The diplomatic community here believes that the withdrawal of the British defense force from Shanghai is a precautionary measure, as British-Japanese relations are currently strained. They point out that outposts like Shanghai would be indefensible in the event of an incident. (United Press dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles, when meeting with reporters today, addressed the British withdrawal of troops stationed in China, stating that the British had notified the U.S. of this decision in advance. However, this decision has no impact on the U.S. position in China. Whether this move by the British will result in a wider distribution of U.S. troops currently stationed in China is a matter for the local military authorities to decide. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Non-official sources in Washington, while acknowledging that some British troops stationed in China, particularly those in Beijing, are of little use, feel that the withdrawal of British troops from Shanghai places an unfair burden on the U.S. Marine Corps to maintain the security of the International Settlement, as British interests are the greatest in the International Settlement. From a general policy perspective, any action that can be seen as a compromising gesture is particularly inappropriate at this time. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Senator Stonebraker stated in the Senate yesterday that, according to reports received, "Japan is in danger of invading the Malay Peninsula, thereby threatening U.S. interests." He continued, "The U.S. fleet should remain stationed in the Pacific." (United Press dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>This morning, all Chinese-language newspapers in Chongqing prominently published news of the British withdrawal of troops from Shanghai and North China, but without criticism. According to some Chinese opinions, this action may indicate that the British are now preparing for unforeseen circumstances in the Far East, concentrating their forces to defend Hong Kong and Singapore. Other Chinese, however, fear that this step may be the result of an understanding with Japan, including the British withdrawal from China and Japan undertaking to temporarily postpone an attack on Hong Kong. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Since the news of the British withdrawal of troops from Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai reached Tianjin, the British military authorities here dispatched special patrols to inspect the streets and ordered British soldiers to return to their barracks. By 11 p.m. last night, no British troops were seen on the streets. It is widely believed that the British troops are likely heading to Hong Kong or Singapore. It is generally believed that after the British withdrawal, the patrolling of the British Concession will be taken over by the U.S. Navy. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Ottawa sources believe that the British withdrawal of troops from China indicates that Japan is now preparing to exert pressure while Britain is occupied elsewhere. Britain is redeploying its troops stationed in China to concentrate on key locations to deter this move by Japan. Canadians are slightly apprehensive about this complex situation in Asia, while government officials remain silent on the matter. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>British Withdrawal of Troops from China: Japanese Newspapers See as Political Posture</p>
<p>Tokyo This morning, all Japanese newspapers featured the British decision to withdraw troops from China as the most important news. Although Britain retains its rights under the Beijing Treaty, general opinion believes that since British troops have withdrawn from China, they will not return and will have little impact. The Asahi Shimbun stated that this is a small scheme and cannot but be regarded as the final strategy when Germany invades Britain. If Britain sincerely wishes to compromise with Japan, it must immediately fundamentally reform its Far East policy and genuinely cooperate with Japan. According to the Hochi Shimbun, Foreign Minister Matsuoka, upon hearing the news, commented, "I think this move by Britain must be related to the spy case. But we can say that Britain is today in a helpless position and has no choice but to take this action." Matsuoka also said that Japan has not abandoned its intention to take countermeasures regarding the arrest of Japanese residents. "I think Britain's arrest of Japanese residents is not only out of retaliatory motives but has deeper meanings. Its purpose must be unpleasant. I cannot currently say what its purpose is, just as I cannot say what Japan's countermeasures will be." (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Tokyo After Britain announced the withdrawal of troops stationed in China, people here were quite surprised. It is currently unknown whether Britain will entrust other countries to protect the British concessions in various places. Japan has opposed Britain's suggestion of having U.S. troops replace British troops, believing that all rights enjoyed by Britain should be returned to China immediately. The number of troops stationed in China by various countries is as follows: Beijing: British troops 50, Italian troops 50, French troops 50, U.S. troops 250; Tianjin: British troops 120, French troops 200, Italian troops 100, American troops 100; Shanghai: British officers 70, soldiers 1,500, French troops 1,000, Italian troops 205, U.S. officers 50, soldiers 1,000.</p>
<p>Military sources here believe that British troops stationed in China will be withdrawn to Egypt. They point out that Britain had no choice but to transfer these small numbers of troops due to the urgent war situation, and emphasize that Britain's troop withdrawal has significant political implications and can be seen as a sign of the rapid decline of British power in the Far East.

<p>Japanese Parliamentarians Pass Resolution Advocating Expulsion of British Influence</p>
<p>Hong Kong, Tokyo dispatch: One hundred and twenty-six members of parliament held a meeting last night and passed a resolution strongly condemning Britain for aiding China and hindering the construction of the "New Order in East Asia." The recent arrest of Japanese residents by the British is considered by the parliamentarians to be an extremely barbaric and unforgivable retaliatory measure against Japan. Therefore, they urge the government to take a firm stance and implement all effective measures to expel British influence in the Far East. (9th dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong, Tokyo dispatch: This morning, representatives of the far-right Japanese political party (East Asia Association) visited Konoe, Matsuoka, Tojo, and Atsuta to personally deliver the party's petition, urging the government to declare war on Britain to completely resolve the incident of British arrest of Japanese residents.

<p>Tokyo Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke told reporters that the Japanese government, within the scope of "building Greater East Asia," will cooperate fully with countries that agree with Japan's views, but Japan is determined to overcome all obstacles to the future. Matsuoka stressed the need to find a way to resolve the China Incident soon, but opposed compensatory and incomplete methods, because the China Incident cannot be solved independently from the general international situation. Matsuoka also pointed out the smooth progress of the negotiations between Ambassador Abe and Wang Jingwei to conclude a treaty, and predicted that this would be restored. He said that the Chongqing regime has now reached the final stage of its resistance against Japan. Approximately when General Chiang Kai-shek believes that those around him have a clear understanding of Japan's true intentions is not far away. The Chongqing regime's ability to resist Japan to date should be attributed to goods and military supplies supplied by various countries through the Vietnam and Burma roads. Transportation of aid to Chongqing through the above-mentioned routes has now ceased. France has gradually adopted an attitude of complying with Japan's fair demands. Matsuoka said that the Japanese government has been closely observing the increasingly tense and complex situation in Europe and the United States, because the actions of Western powers have a significant relationship to Japan's national policy. Finally, Matsuoka said that the impact of the development of the international situation on the commercial aspect cannot be ignored. Major changes in the economic situation are expected and must be dealt with. The Japanese government has already taken measures as needed from time to time. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>

<p>Cairo The Gulf of Aden, overlooking the lower Red Sea, which is the lifeline of the British Empire, has become the newest battlefield. According to the announcement, two columns of Italian troops are advancing towards Perim from the land. A naval aircraft from the Australian cruiser "Hobart" dived down and dropped bombs, destroying the Italian headquarters in Zeila Harbor. It is believed that this astonishing move delayed the advance of the Italian troops along the coast to Perim. The task of advancing has now been handed over to the Fascist column, which has advanced towards Hargeisa and Odweina. These two columns must advance to their new target through the extremely difficult and desolate Sahann Mountains. At the same time, Italian warplanes fiercely bombed the British fleet in the Gulf of Aden, resulting in very little damage to the British fleet. It is reported that Italian troops are still concentrated on the Libyan-Egyptian border, but there is no action. (International News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>

The aircraft then safely returned to the ship. On Thursday, Italian aircraft bombed a British ship in the Gulf of Aden, but the planes flew very high, dropping bombs inaccurately and causing no damage. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Cairo This morning, the British Air Force issued a communiqué stating that yesterday, British bombers attacked ships in Tobruk Harbor (an important Libyan naval base). A ship berthed at the pier was hit and caught fire. When the British aircraft flew more than 20 miles away, the ship was still burning. On the East African front, positions along the Hargeisa to Tug Argan highway were bombed by British aircraft, and several bombs were dropped on anti-aircraft gun positions and troops in the Karin Pass area. When British aircraft bombed Massawa, several bombs were seen falling near the pier, and buildings near an anti-aircraft gun position and air force barracks were directly hit. The enemy's anti-aircraft artillery opened fire fiercely, and enemy fighters also took off to attack, but all British aircraft returned safely to their base. Also, in another attack, a bomb fell near a floating dock. British bombers also bombed an oil depot in Madagascar, shooting down an Italian bomber. All British aircraft flew back to their bases. South African Air Force bombed the Neghelli airfield, destroying two Italian Caproni-type bombers parked on the ground, one of which caught fire and the other was blown to smithereens. Two more aircraft of the same type were damaged. In addition, bombs also hit houses and machine gun positions. Only one rear gunner on a British aircraft was injured. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>

Italian aircraft have attempted to test Gibraltar's strength, but have only been able to fly over three times. The bombs they dropped did not hit military targets and caused no damage. Thousands of civilians have been evacuated, and the area is becoming increasingly militarized. A large number of workers are working in the summer heat to strengthen the defenses. The morale of the soldiers is very high. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Milan The Milan People's News reported that three British destroyers sailed from Gibraltar yesterday, heading towards the Mediterranean. (Haitong dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Last night, an aircraft of unknown nationality bombed Gibraltar again, and the anti-aircraft guns immediately fired at it. The residents were quite panicked. It is currently unknown what damage the bombs caused. Local newspapers reported that 1,200 people will be evacuated from Gibraltar today. Yesterday, three British destroyers sailed to the Mediterranean, destination unknown. A convoy of merchant ships, escorted by warships, sailed towards the Atlantic. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>After several small squadrons of the British fleet left Gibraltar, only one battleship and one cruiser, two destroyers, auxiliary ships, and transport ships each remain, along with many aircraft. There are a total of twenty-two merchant ships from various countries remaining in the port. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e20">Anti-British Empire War Actually Already Begun; British Naval and Air Power Certainly Not To Be Underestimated; Reason for Germany's "Blitzkrieg" Being Delayed; Lloyd George's Eloquent Discussion of the War Situation <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Former British Prime Minister during the last World War, Lloyd George, recently gave a speech, saying that Germany's blitzkrieg against Britain has not yet begun. He said, "The war in Britain has not actually yet begun, but the war for the British Empire has clearly begun. Regarding the war to conquer the British Isles, the Nazi Party has not launched any large-scale attack that could make the British Isles bow and submit. Although Nazi planes have bombed our coastal towns and sometimes even flown into the inland skies, they have not yet used their full air power to destroy our factories, railway hubs, and seaports in a wholesale manner. The Nazi attacks on our country have become more serious in both air and submarine attacks. As for the land, our means of production and people have not suffered major losses. Although the shipping industry has indeed suffered losses, they are not to a terrifying extent. The estimates broadcast by German radio stations have been carefully examined by me and are actually very ridiculous. It is clear that the Germans have not yet exerted their full strength in the naval and air aspects of this final battle against their last enemy. People generally feel that the Germans must have more sinister actions in reserve. The British people have no illusions about the future situation, and are ready to face even more terrible things than they are currently experiencing. Why has the attack that we often hear will make Britain submit been delayed? This point has been explained by German Air Minister General Goering. According to him, until now, the Nazi Party's actions have only been reconnaissance work. The German planes sent to fly around here are inspecting the reality of our country's defenses. According to Goering and his subordinates, this long delay is due to the German command's cautious attitude in preparing to launch an attack, and to prevent the German people from becoming impatient due to repeated rapid victories. They also predict that the attack to destroy the resistance of this only enemy will not be delayed any longer. The planes that the Germans are using to attack ships at sea cannot be regarded as purely reconnaissance planes. Most of these planes are bombers escorted by fighter planes. The activities of these planes can be said to be testing a new method of attack that combines fighter planes and bombers. If one considers the enemy's land and air power, one knows that the enemy's leaders have clearly not exerted their full strength to defeat us in one fell swoop. Therefore, the enemy's current actions are a threat that has not yet materialized. It is impossible to predict whether the enemy is only using this threat to coerce us into a shameful peace, but we must be prepared. Whether the enemy invades our country with all their mechanized equipment, or whether their attack is limited to air raids on our ships, warships, seaports, transportation, and factories, we have engaged in vigorous preparations to counter all kinds of enemy plans. To effectively respond to the enemy's plans mentioned above, air superiority is the only condition. Although the German air force is numerous, it does not have the advantage that our country has. Through continuous and arduous battles, British planes have become superior to enemy planes in combat, and the skills of British aviators in flying planes are also better than those of their opponents. The largest air battle in the English Channel last Tuesday has further strengthened our belief. The German air force has not yet had the necessary power to prove that the German staff's driving of planes to risk crossing the sea to invade is justified, and the British navy already has the power to defeat the invaders. This fact may also be the reason why the Germans have been slow to launch a major attack. The air battle on Thursday further made the Germans, who mistakenly believed that they were capable of overcoming all difficulties, have to reconsider their plans. However, although the Nazi Party's plan to destroy Britain has not yet been realized, the war against the British Empire has actually begun.</p>
<p>Italian Military Strategy Not To Be Taken Lightly</p>
<p>Italy has joined the attack on Britain's African empire. Judging from the operational plans they have expressed, they intend to cut the British Empire from the Mediterranean to the Equator into pieces, and reorganize an old Roman Empire in North Africa from the pieces of British and French territories. They have already occupied Kassala, the most important military location in central Sudan. They are waiting for the floodwaters to recede before advancing further to occupy the remaining rich and fertile areas. The Italians have now begun to attack British Somaliland. If this area is occupied by the Italian army, the Italian territory will be expanded to the remaining unoccupied parts of the coast of the Gulf of Aden. The Italians have also threatened the road to Kenya, and launched their attempt to annex tropical Africa. The most important thing is that the large army of Libya is threatening Egypt, a country famous in the world. Egypt is not only a famous country in history, but also has special importance because it is a strategic location connecting the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. The surrender of France was a disappointing blow to resisting this dangerous attack. France also has a large army in Tunisia and Syria. If the armies of Tunisia and Syria were to unite with the strong British garrison in Egypt and Sudan, this military force, even if not absolutely superior, could be comparable to the army that Italy could send to Africa. If Alexandria and Port Said are occupied, the British fleet in the Mediterranean will be in a dangerous position.</p>
<p>Spain Is Also Eager To Make A Move</p>
<p>Also, Fascist Spain is preparing to jump into the battlefield, and has already designated Gibraltar and French Morocco as its spoils of war. Military experts who doubt whether Germany threatens Britain believe that Germany's plan is intended to prevent Britain from sending reinforcements to the Mediterranean, so that it cannot reinforce the annexation of French territories in the continent. Germany could then send powerful tanks to assist the Italian army, but there is currently no news of this attack. Therefore, the British government is carefully engaged in strengthening its defenses and protecting its African territories. If Britain proves that its naval power is unbreakable, it will be able to adjust the situation in Africa." (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e21">Pravda Observes The War Situation: Portugal Will Become A Battlefield; Relations Between Portugal and Spain Are Becoming Increasingly Close; Spain Clearly Has The Possibility Of Participating In The War <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Moscow's "Pravda" published a commentary today entitled "The Struggle for Portugal's War Base," saying, "Since the outbreak of the war, Britain's political and economic position in Portugal has been greatly shaken. In view of Italy's threat and Spain's possibility of participating in the war, London has demanded that Portugal guarantee that if Spain invades Gibraltar or France, Portugal should take action against Spain. However, the Portuguese government has declared that it will maintain neutrality. Britain is trying its best to prevent the tendency of Portugal and Spain to get closer, but it knows that this work is by no means easy. On July 26, Britain signed a trade agreement with Portugal and Spain, but its purpose has still not been achieved. Spain has openly declared that it will declare war on Britain in response to the British blockade. On July 30, Spain again signed an appendix to the friendship and non-aggression treaty with Portugal. This new agreement is aimed at Britain. Therefore, Britain is in great danger of losing its last base on the European continent. Although Britain will never give up easily, from this point of view, Portugal will become an imperialist battlefield." (Tass, 9th)</p>
<p>Regarding the supplementary agreement recently signed between Spain and Portugal, the "German General Report" mainly stated that in view of the increasing crisis in Gibraltar, the signing of the agreement can be said to be a timely move. Portugal's foreign policy has always been pro-British. The signing of the new agreement is a revolutionary act. Both Spain and Portugal know that after Britain is forced to abandon Gibraltar, it will look for another naval base on the European continent. Britain has the possibility of occupying Lisbon or Lagos Port in Portugal. The recent increase in the garrison in Gibraltar to 15,000 people and the unloading of a large number of tanks can be used as evidence. Spain has now decided not to infringe on Portugal's territorial sovereignty. If Britain wants to occupy Portuguese seaports, Spain may use force to assist Portugal. (Haitong, 10th)</p>

<p>New York Many people in the United States believe that even if Hitler can defeat Britain, he may not be able to attack the United States immediately. Most people think that Germany will need at least five years to prepare for this major move. However, Professor Ulei, director of chemistry at Columbia University in New York, who discovered heavy water, believes that if Germany wins the war against Britain, the United States must face the possibility of a defensive war before the end of this summer. Ulei made this warning when announcing that 820 scientists had formed a group to promote the purpose of the Committee to Defend the Americas by Assisting the Allied Powers. Ulei said that if Germany defeats Britain, the war in Western Europe can be ended, and Hitler will then seem to quickly attack us, and take the route of Iceland and Greenland, and use Nazi forces to penetrate South America, in order to implement this move. The German army will definitely attack the defenses of the Panama Canal, or will achieve the purpose of damaging the defenses. It is reported that Ulei won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1934.

<h3 id="e39">European War True Record (5) - The Reasons for France's Defeat (Continued) <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Why did France collapse? Marshal Pétain, the hero of Verdun, once saved the battle situation in the last European war with the immortal slogan "They shall not pass." Why did the Bordeaux government he leads today sign an armistice treaty with German Führer Hitler? What fate has befallen the French Republic and its great army?</p>
<p>The greatness and courage of France are beyond doubt. Every Frenchman, whether civilian or soldier, has long been known for their bravery in the past and in the recent series of battles. Those who have not experienced the horrors of modern warfare, such as air raids and tank attacks, are not qualified to make irresponsible criticisms. Those who have lived in France for a long time and love France should be the last to doubt the greatness of the French nation.</p>
<p>However, after careful study of the recent situation in France and based on seven years of experience living in France, the reporter can make the following deductions:</p>
<p>(1) The main reason for France's failure is the failure of its democratic political system. This is not a failure of democracy itself, nor is it a failure of the French people. It means that the French political system could not cope with the ruthless blows of dictatorial militarism in this great era of human history.</p>
<p>This is a problem of leadership, or rather a lack of leadership. First, there is a lack of political leaders, and second, a lack of military leaders. This is the root cause of France's decline.</p>
<p>Reviewing various records, we can find that in both France and Britain, many young officers had already correctly foreseen the manner of the German offensive. However, they repeatedly suggested to the British and French governments that they devise appropriate strategies to deal with this offensive. The inertia and short-sightedness of politicians in both countries made these warnings fall on deaf ears.</p>
<p>(2) Passively adopting the theory that France could remain safe behind the Maginot Line, and being overly rigid in adhering to the principle of defensive warfare, only demoralized the initiative and courage of most members of the French General Staff. Certain elements, even if not traitors, are guilty of ineffective combat.</p>
<p>(3) After the fall of Sedan, the elite French soldiers and junior officers had already felt misled by their supreme commander. Reports from all sides confirm that many French units, both large and small, were able to fight bravely, and in some places, even fought alone.</p>
<p>However, these reports also unanimously confirm that most French soldiers (who are all thinking people) uniformly confessed, "I have long been aware of the corruption of our French government authorities, but I still thought I could trust our generals. Now our generals have also missed the opportunity, so what's the point?"</p>
<p>After the Germans first broke through the lines, this kind of widespread demoralization had already spread to certain parts of the French army. This is absolutely true.</p>
<p>(4) In some places, the highest French authorities could not avoid missing opportunities. For example, the French army in Flanders was cut off for six days without receiving any orders from the General Headquarters. This is unbelievable, but it is true. After the Somme and Aisne lines were breached for the second time, the French General Headquarters almost completely disintegrated.</p>
<p>(5) The breakthrough of the French lines was the key that determined the victory or defeat of the Battle of France. All observers acknowledge the reason for this: in part, it was due to the failure to destroy the bridges over the Meuse River, which was the biggest mistake. Another part was due to the stupidity of politicians in Paris who did not understand whether the fortresses on the borders of Luxembourg and Belgium were as strong as the Maginot Line. Still another part was due to the inexcusable mistake of deploying poorly equipped second-rate troops to defend the vital areas on the Belgian-Luxembourg border.</p>
<p>Another reason was the numerical and equipment superiority of the German army, especially the German air force. But the main reason was that the French army was completely unprepared for the close coordination and concentrated attacks of large numbers of German tanks and large numbers of fighter-bombers. In addition to the joint offensive of huge mechanized monsters on land and in the air, the German side also had well-trained, responsive mechanized infantry, who followed up quickly to support the tank assaults. According to observers, when the French army fought, they still rigidly adhered to the orders they had been trained in. As soon as enemy planes flew over, they would lie down, take refuge in the woods, or hide behind various shelters, thinking that they could avoid bullets. Who knew that when they came out, the German tank columns had already rolled past in full force.</p>
<p>(6) French logic is excellent when talking about military affairs on paper, but it is absolutely unable to cope with this sudden new situation. The result is that senior officers become discouraged and disintegrated, and this situation quickly spread throughout the army.</p>
<p>This rigid logic of the French also led their political and military authorities to make a deduction: since the front line has been breached and the army has disintegrated, victory is impossible, and France has no hope of winning. Logically speaking, France can only request an armistice.</p>
<p>Under the same circumstances, the British, who value instinct over logic, would first of all not admit the possibility of defeat, and secondly, insist that the only way out is to continue fighting.</p>
<p>(7) The appointment of Laval as Deputy Prime Minister by the Bordeaux government, making France's surrender, gives an unpleasant impression. Both the Foreign Minister of the Bordeaux government, Baudouin, and Laval, are staunch advocates of appeasing Italy. When Prime Minister Pétain was the ambassador to Spain, he also strongly supported Spanish leader Franco. This is not an</p>
<p>In short, the reason for France's defeat lies in the failure to devote all its energy to manufacturing airplanes, tanks, munitions, and other important military supplies according to the output of totalitarian countries before the outbreak of the war.</p>
<p>Britain's failure to counter the German mechanized forces with a better-equipped army, especially with more fighters and bombers, should undoubtedly share responsibility with France.</p>
<p>But the root cause of all this lies in the political turmoil in France over the years, which sometimes made it seem like a disunited country. Among the French people, the imperialists, royalists, nobles, and industrial giants have never completely lost their enormous influence. At the other extreme, there are the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, which have a great deal of latent influence in the labor movement.</p>
<p>The hardworking and resilient farmers of France accounted for 80% of the total French population before 1914, but by 1940, this had decreased to less than 50%. If France had not faced the threat of war in the past ten years, it might have been able to peacefully complete a revolutionary transformation. Now, in the bleak shadow of war and defeat, her greatest struggle is undoubtedly to seek revival.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Hong Kong English Colleges to Change Academic System Next Semester; Graduation Examinations from Next Year Will No Longer Use Hong Kong University Entrance Examinations to Determine Qualifications <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) The academic system of public and private English schools in Hong Kong originally stipulated that Grades 8 to 4 were primary school, Grades 3 to 1 were secondary school. After completing Grade 1, neither the Hong Kong Education Department nor the schools held graduation examinations. Students had to take the Hong Kong University Entrance Examination. Those whose scores in each subject and average score were above 40 were recognized as having completed secondary school and were allowed to enter university. Those whose scores were below 40 but above 33 were only recognized as having completed secondary school. However, the Education Department changed this system some years ago, newly stipulating that Grades 8 to 4 were primary school, Grades 3 to 2 were secondary school, and Grade 1 was university preparatory. Those who did not intend to go to university could take the Hong Kong Education Department's annual Hong Kong English Schools Secondary School Graduation Examination after completing Grade 2. Those who passed were recognized as having completed secondary school and were issued a graduation certificate by the Education Department, but could not go to university. Those who intended to go to university had to take the secondary school graduation examination and, after passing, continue studying in Grade 1 before taking the university entrance examination. This academic system has been changed for many years, and this year is also in accordance with this system. Now it is learned that the Education Department has decided to change this academic system again from the next semester, canceling Grade 1 as university preparatory and restoring the previous system of Grades 8 to 4 as primary school and Grades 3 to 1 as secondary school. Therefore, whether one intends to go to university or not, one must complete the entire curriculum from Grades 8 to 1. The Hong Kong English Schools Graduation Examination, which the Education Department has held every year, will also be discontinued from next year due to the change in the academic system.</p>

<p>The Hezhong Cup Charity Basketball Tournament will have two matches in Group A-1 starting at 5:30 p.m. today, with double the excitement.

<h3 id="e51">Finance: Tension Seen Again in the Foreign Exchange Market; Selling British Gold and Buying American Dollars <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation saw the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) announce its exchange rates. The British exchange rate remained unchanged, while the American exchange rate fell by 0.0625, calculated at 5.375 yuan. Other exchange rates, such as the Japanese, Dutch, and so on, were also uniformly tight. As for the domestic market situation, the tight atmosphere was acute, because the British were about to withdraw their troops stationed in China, causing unease in the market. It was also heard that a certain major bank in the city was experiencing a run on deposits, so the black market suddenly saw selling of British currency and buying of American currency. Therefore, the price of American currency was the tightest. The spot price of 5.375 yuan was difficult to settle. Sassoon and others sold at one point, and speculators also slightly liquidated, causing the rate to harden. But by noon, the market was still tight. The closing price of British gold was 3 shillings 7.03125, and the American exchange rate was 5.40625 yuan, a slight decrease of 0.03125 from the previous day for the British currency and a decrease of 0.125 for the American currency. Futures were especially popular, so they diverged slightly from spot rates. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Tight American Exchange Rate</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the London large bar was close, falling by 1.875. The New York silver price remained flat, and the London gold price was fixed. The exchange rate of British currency against American currency was unchanged, and the rate against Shanghai was also flat. There was no market for the French currency. The American rate was up 6.5 points against the British rate, flat against the Shanghai rate, and no market for the French currency. The Central Bank's exchange rates were the same as before. Banks opened in the morning with a spot selling price of 3 shillings 6.875 for British gold and 5.4375 yuan for American currency, a sharp increase of 0.046875 for British gold and a sharp decrease of 0.09375 for American currency compared to the previous day's closing. At the same time, futures opened, uniformly softening. This was because the news of the British withdrawal of troops stationed in China had already been reported, and people felt quite uneasy. The market opened tight. Japanese banks first bought the American exchange rate at 5.40625 yuan, and then Chinese speculators came to buy unanimously. It was also heard that a certain major bank was experiencing a run on deposits, with many withdrawing funds to buy American currency. Speculators entered foreign banks, buying the American exchange rate for August at 5.40625 to 5.375 yuan, and the American exchange rate for September at 5.375 and 5.3125 yuan. The HSBC exchange rate was announced, the British exchange rate remaining flat, and the American exchange rate was revised to 5.375 yuan, a tightening of 0.0625. The White Silver Equalization Tax was announced, with no increase or decrease. Afterwards, the market stabilized. It is calculated that Hong Kong Electric Sassoon slightly sold to foreign banks, with the spot rate being 3 shillings 7.1875. The Banque de l'Indochine also sold the American exchange rate for September at 5.34375 yuan. Speculators then re-emerged, buying the American exchange rate for August at 5.46875 yuan, but speculators soon came to buy and settle, buying the American exchange rate for August at 5.375 yuan and September at 5.3125 yuan. Small private banks bought US dollars from American banks at a price of 5.375 yuan. There were few changes before the close of the market. The underlying trend was still popular for the American exchange rate. As a result, British gold was 3 shillings 7.03125, and the American exchange rate was 5.40625 yuan. The August British exchange rate was the same as the spot rate, and the American exchange rate was 5.34375 yuan. The September British gold was 3 shillings 6.875, and the American exchange rate was 5.28125 yuan, a decrease of 0.125 for the spot American exchange rate and a decrease of 0.031225 for British gold compared to the previous day. The August and September American exchange rates were both tighter by 0.1875. The British gold September slightly decreased by 0.015625. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the unofficial cash gold market was extremely active, with prices soaring to nearly $5,900. This was attributed to the impending withdrawal of British troops from China, creating an unstable political situation. While the future is uncertain, the exchange rate is tightening, and rumors of certain local banks resuming withdrawals in U.S. dollars have fueled demand. Consequently, the number of gold buyers has increased significantly. The market opened at $5,780, a $95 increase from the previous day. Initially, gold dealers sold, causing a $30 drop. However, the foreign exchange market tightened sharply, and gold dealers pushed the price up to $5,830. Although the exchange rate slightly hardened and local speculators took profits, pulling the price back to $5,780, the exchange rate soon softened again, prompting securities firms and others to aggressively buy, driving the price to a new high of $5,870. Ultimately, due to increased selling by smaller investors, the market closed at $5,840, up $155 from the previous day. In the afternoon, the market was closed for Saturday, but small transactions occurred outside the market at around $5,805, with the final price at $5,820. Total trading volume for the half-day was nearly 2,000 taels. Jewelry stores raised their gold prices by $10, while customs gold prices remained stable.</p>
<p>Cash Gold Up $155</p>
<p>Since morning, the exchange rate has been the main focus, boosting morale. The market opened with a buying frenzy, pushing the price up by $15. Silver firms and gold dealers bought 50 taels at $5,780. Subsequently, due to selling by gold dealers and money changers, the price fell slightly by $30. A gold dealer sold 10 taels to a silver firm, lowering the price to $5,750. Then, securities firms and silver firms suddenly started buying aggressively, and a certain gold dealer followed suit. Before long, the price was pushed up by $80. A silver firm bought 10 taels from a gold dealer, raising the price to $5,830. However, due to the exchange rate hardening, the buying frenzy subsided. Smaller investors took profits, and a major long-term investor started selling, while a money changer continued to sell occasionally. The price retreated to $5,780. Afterward, the foreign exchange market tightened again, and gold and silver firms competed to buy. Soon, a certain money changer switched from selling to buying, and securities firms were also aggressively buying. This drove the price up to $5,870. However, trading volume was limited, and the buying frenzy weakened slightly. Securities firms turned from buying to selling, so the market closed at $5,840, up $155 from the previous day. The fluctuation range for the half-day was $120. The selling price of cash gold by cash gold firms was over ten dollars higher than the listed price, while the buying price was thirty dollars lower. The current spot gold price was over fifty dollars lower than the listed gold price, but there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Prices Remain High at $600</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry by major jewelry stores initially remained at $590 per tael. Then, at 10:30, it was raised by ten dollars. Since then there have been no changes, with major stores setting it at $600. The prices of new stores were the same as the previous prices, with buying prices about thirty dollars lower.</p>

Demand for British gold notes remained strong, and the market price continued to rise by 20 cents. The U.S. dollar briefly soared to $18.75, but the release of some cash by American banks eased market sentiment. The final price was $18.60, still a sharp increase of 45 cents from the previous day. Hong Kong notes also rose to $4.04. Singapore, Annam, Rupee, Canadian, and Philippine notes all trended upwards. Demand for Japanese gold notes remained strong, and the evening market continued to rise to $1.1365. Korean rice retreated instead of advancing, falling to $1.07 yesterday.</p>

<p>In the unofficial securities market, the drawing of lots for Category A shares took place yesterday. Unexpected changes in the environment, including rising gold prices and a tightening exchange rate, led to a decline in the bond market. The Category A shares, excluding the right to draw lots, fell by $1.50 compared to the previous day. In reality, the amount that should have been deducted for the right to draw lots was only $0.80 to $1.00. However, market sentiment was slightly weak, so the price fell more than expected. In the morning, Hongda, Wankang, and Hengfu shares were sold, while Jiufeng and Lianhe covered short positions, and Xinfu bought a significant amount, causing the market price to fall by $0.30 to $0.40.

<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market suddenly showed a fluctuating situation. In the morning, both buyers and sellers were hesitant, and there were few transactions, remaining stable. At midday, news of rising gold prices and a tightening exchange rate spread, and short sellers took the opportunity to cover their positions, while speculators and retail investors absorbed the supply. Local stores also added to the activity. In an instant, buying interest was strong, and prices rose by about $1.50. Number One Chen Saigon was priced at $59.50, Number Two at $55, Number Two Siam at $54.50, and Fire Grain at $58.50, Small Jia at $54.50. At this point, buying and selling were mixed, and the market became volatile. Afterward, those who had made profits rushed to sell at high prices, and with abundant supply, the market gradually calmed down. By afternoon, the market had softened again, and prices fell back down. As a result, the closing prices were slightly higher than before, with Number One Chen Saigon at $58.50, Number Two at $54, Number Two Siam at $53, and Fire Grain at $57. In the recycled original bags, early market expectations of a tightening exchange rate and rising gold prices pushed up prices, with Number Two Saigon opening at $64.50, a premium of over half a dollar, then rising to $64.50, a dollar more than the previous day's price of $63.50. However, due to weak actual sales and speculators observing, the endless supply of foreign rice resulted in warehouse stocks exceeding 800,000 bags, while customer sales remained absent. Sellers inevitably felt uneasy, and retail speculators who had already made profits sought to exit. As a result, Number Two Saigon suddenly fell by $1 in the afternoon, returning to the original price of $63.50. Number Two Siam also opened at $64 and rose to $64.50, an increase of a dollar, but fell back to $63.80 in the afternoon, a gain of only $0.30. However, buying and selling were both active, with about 500 tons of original bags traded. There were also pillow-like transactions in the current rice market, with 7,000 to 8,000 bags traded.</p>
<p>Another shipment of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai. The French company's "Kindia" ship, directly loaded with 5,000 bags of foreign rice from West Africa, arrived yesterday afternoon and berthed at piers 18 and 19 for unloading. (Translator)</p>
<p>The source of thick and thin "Jing" rice and other domestic rice continued to be interrupted, leading to a rise in prices in the unofficial market. Transactions were frequent, and prices rose by nearly a dollar. High-quality special fresh "Qing Jing" rice from local producers returned to the $70 mark, with special "Jing" at $68-69, "Wuxi Qing Jing" at $68 and $67, and "Changzhou Su Kun Jing" at $66-67. Lower quality rice from Suqian was at $64. Thin rice remained unavailable due to lack of supply. Fresh early rice from Nangang original bags was at $65-66, rice from Suqian at $61-62, and fresh rice from Hukou was at $63.</p>
<p>New "Jing" rice from Zhoupu continued to be scarce due to transportation difficulties. Only about 20 "dan" (a unit of weight) arrived, but demand was high due to the season, making it a popular product. This created an imbalance between supply and demand, making the market exceptionally tight, opening at $63.50, up half a dollar from before.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Active Flour Sales <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour trade was brisk for both local and outside buyers. In addition to zero-lot sales of "Old Vehicle" and "Fuxin" brand flour, the local market gradually adopted "Phoenix" brand Japanese flour. Recently, North China traders have been very active in moving Japanese flour due to its convenient transport and lower prices compared to factory flour. This situation has led to increased sales and rising prices for the Japanese flour. Yesterday, the August price for "Phoenix" flour opened at $14.65, and the September price at $14.75, up $0.15 from the previous day, and a total increase of $0.60-0.70 in three days. However, the factory prices for Chinese flour remained the same, while the output from various factories declined due to disruptions in raw material supply, leading to a smaller supply and higher prices for "recycled" flour compared to factory flour by $0.20.</p>
<p>The wheat market also improved yesterday due to increased purchases by Japanese factories, especially the Sanxin Factory, which produced more Phoenix flour and needed the most wheat. Yesterday, 6,000 bags of Beijing and Wu wheat were purchased at $19.50 to $19, still being evaluated. Chinese factories still only bought small quantities at prices that have quietly increased by $0.50 to $0.60.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Yarn and Cotton: Deteriorating Conditions, Unstable Yarn Prices, "Double Horse" Drops Another $21, Market Closed for the Next Two Days <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to decline, and the trend was very weak. This was because the actual situation had made little progress, and at the same time, the environment was unfavorable. Therefore, although the foreign exchange shrinkage was severe and gold prices rose sharply, it failed to stimulate the market. The yarn market could not prosper as a result. Furthermore, the factory sold a large number of factory orders in the past, resulting in a glut of goods on the market, temporarily suppressing prices. Most investors must watch the $950 mark, fearing a breakthrough before taking any action.</p>
<p>The current yarn market opened with the expectation of further exchange rate declines, but there were still many buyers. The price of 20-count "Double Horse" yarn was $1,000, $10 higher than the previous day. However, after trading began, selling pressure increased sharply, and there were few buyers. In addition, speculators, sensing unfavorable conditions, rushed to sell, and the market was unable to sustain and fell step by step to $975. This was because the market would be closed for two days starting tomorrow, due to the August 13th anniversary, and would reopen on the 14th. Speculators with no ability to buy wanted to settle their positions, causing market weakness. After the close, the market rebounded. According to half-day statistics, 1,910 bales were traded. The price of 20-count "Double Horse" yarn fell $21. Today, 265 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The following is the amount purchased by each group:</p>
<h3 id="e58">Cotton Relies on Local Trading <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The current cotton trade remained sluggish, and factory purchases were particularly slow. However, due to the exchange rate tightening, local firms traded with each other, providing some activity. As for the factory side, the price of yarn not only failed to rise but declined. The current cotton transaction situation is on the left:</p>
<p>In other news, the market price of foreign cotton in New York was weak. The selling by cash merchants resulted in very sluggish results. Closing prices were down four points for near-term contracts compared to the previous day, and Indian cotton prices were down four rupees.</p>
<p>The exchange rate in Shanghai's foreign cotton market tightened, but yarn prices fell, so the cotton market showed no improvement. The prices of foreign firms were calculated based on the exchange rate. The difference between the previous two days was an increase of over $10 per "dan" for American cotton. Overall trading was exceptionally quiet.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Piece Goods: Domestically Sold Cotton Cloth Imported from Aojiang <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The domestic cloth market was firm, because current sales from all routes were good. The "Changde" ship sailed from Zhejiang's Aojiang, and imported safely. Business from Wenzhou was continuous, and it is hoped that customer demand will increase. But because raw yarn was weak, speculator confidence declined slightly, and selling was stable. Some hand goods were discounted by $0.10 to $0.25 per piece. Over 500 pieces of various goods were traded in the local market. Demand for bleached and dyed grey fabrics was relatively strong. Over 300 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, and coarse cloth were traded by Zhejiang merchants, over 200 pieces of twill, fine cloth, and colored cloth by Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants, and over 200 pieces of colored cloth and coarse cloth by Yantai and Tianjin merchants. 5,000+ pieces of bleached cloth, bleached twill, poplin, and colored cloth from Siam and other places were traded.</p>
<p>The Eastern cloth market continued to rise. Active sales of colored cloth and colored twill, as well as white goods and dyed greige fabric, resulted in the local market being elevated. Fine cloth and fine twill increased by $0.25 to $0.50 per piece. The market for "Dragon Head" fine cloth was elevated by the enthusiasm of the trade. It opened at $33.40, dropped to $33, and then reached a high of $33.70, closing at $33.45. The price of "Four Gentlemen" serge fluctuated between $0.95, but the trend remained strong.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 200 pieces of piece goods were exported to Hong Kong, 75 pieces to Siam, 750 pieces to Yantai, and 60 pieces to Tianjin. Today, 210 pieces are being shipped to Hong Kong and 65 pieces to Singapore.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Miscellaneous Grains: Broad Bean Market Booming <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The source of broad beans was inconsistent and irregular, so the market fluctuated greatly. Recently, the supply has become scarce, while sales have been brisk. Foreign merchants occasionally inquired, leading to a booming market. Prices have repeatedly soared. Yesterday, prices continued to rise by $0.30 to $0.40. Two trucks of green broad beans from Wujiang were traded at prices ranging from $19.35 to $19.65. 230 pieces of green broad beans from Maoshi, Beigang, and over 40 bags of green broad beans from Liuhe were traded at $19.10. Over 120 bags of white broad beans from Jiading were traded at $19.50, and 120 bags of small-grain white broad beans from Wuhu were traded at $14.80.</p>
<p>In other news, 500 bags of raw peanuts were shipped from Yantai yesterday. Also, 425 bags of beans were shipped to Hong Kong today, and 120 bags to Singapore. In addition, 160 bags of sesame were also shipped to Hong Kong. 2,000 cans and 100 pieces of peanut oil came from Yantai yesterday.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw prices rise due to a tightening exchange rate. The Public Association set prices for spot goods at $71.50-$72 for crude white sugar at local warehouses, $71 for old goods at foreign warehouses, and $71.50-$72 for new goods, an increase of $1.50. Re-export goods for delivery on the 15th were at $56, and for delivery on the 22nd were at $56.40, up $0.50-0.60.

<p>Recently, the supply of dried shrimp has been limited, and market stocks have been low, resulting in a lively trend. Yesterday, the traders opened with 18 bags of "Jiangbei Kaiyang" (dried shrimp) at $225. Several boxes of "Yantai Longxudao" tail shrimp arrived, asking $330, but were not sold. The trend is unlikely to be too low.</p>

<p>The new lily bulb season has begun in the production area for several days. Due to transportation difficulties, little has arrived in Shanghai. Because the Shanghai market's old stocks are tight, production prices have also risen. It is said that prices have risen by nearly $10, and goods are already en route and should arrive in Shanghai soon.</p>

<p>New orchid bamboo branches have been on the market in the production area for some time. Due to shipping disruptions between Zhangzhou and Gulangyu, they have not been transported to Shanghai. According to a letter from customers, transportation between Zhangzhou and Gulangyu resumed on the 1st of this month. Priority has been given to the transportation of essential firewood, so miscellaneous goods will be delayed. It is expected that they may arrive in Shanghai next week.</p>

<p>The source of black wood ear is currently disrupted, and the arrival of goods is not smooth. However, sales to the Southeast Asian community are quite active, so the price has risen sharply. Yesterday, the traders opened with a batch of Sichuan wood ear, priced at $383-$380, a sudden increase of over $20. The market price also rose accordingly.</p>
<p>The new golden needles' prices were weak due to softness in the Hong Kong market, the Shanghai market declined. Yesterday, a batch of Xuzhou golden needles arrived, selling for $85, a decrease of over $10.</p>

Tianjin merchants have already been inquiring about various goods, and large mouth tinplate is one of them. The market for tinplate is good, due to limited supply.

<h3 id="e68">British Withdrawal of Shanghai Garrison - Indicates Sale of Far East Military Strength - Rumor Says Defense Zone Left Behind to be Taken Over by US Military - Foreign Defense Forces to Confer Next Week <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Since the British military authorities in London and Shanghai announced the withdrawal of their garrisons in North China and Shanghai for redeployment elsewhere, it has caused a profound reaction among Chinese and foreign residents throughout the city. The position of the concessions is currently precarious, and the political situation is volatile and unpredictable. The British troops’ departure at this time cannot fail to stir emotions. General speculation about the purpose of the British withdrawal centers around two possibilities: either to relocate troops to the south as a silent response to Japan's southward ambitions, or as an implicit gesture of appeasement towards Japan. If it is the latter, it would be tantamount to Britain declaring its withdrawal from the Far East and abandoning its deeply rooted, extensive, and formidable power. Britain would not be so unwise as to do this. Moreover, Britain has notified the Japanese side, stating that it reserves the rights granted by the final protocol signed in Beijing on September 7, 1910. If it is the former, it clearly indicates that Britain's attitude towards Japan will become more proactive. According to news from London, this move is to strengthen the actual strength of the British forces in the Far East. If so, the troop relocation is of great significance. As for the issue of who will take over the defense zone after the British troops' withdrawal, there is a widespread hope that it can be taken over by the US military. Although the US authorities in Shanghai have stated that it must be decided by Washington, the British withdrawal was tacitly approved by the US. There is a great possibility that the US military will take over the defense, which would simplify and stabilize the situation in the concessions. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Unified Concern Among Chinese and Foreign People</p>
<p>Since London issued the order to prepare for the withdrawal of the British defense forces from Shanghai, people in Shanghai have been very concerned. Whether on trams, buses, shops, or offices, all public places are discussing this matter. General commentators believe that, given the recent political developments that have put the Public Concession in a delicate position, Britain's sudden decision to withdraw its defense forces is an unwise move.</p>
<p>No Abandonment of Rights and Interests in China</p>
<p>According to a British diplomatic source yesterday, the British move is purely based on a measure taken for its overall situation. It is a misunderstanding to think that this move means that Britain will abandon its rights and interests and position in China. Britain's rights and interests in China are substantial, and it will not easily abandon them. Regarding who will take over the British military defense zone in Shanghai after the British withdrawal, the source said that he did not know yet, but it should be clear soon. When asked about the impact of the British troop withdrawal on the situation in the Public Concession, he could not comment but stated that Britain would continue to closely monitor the situation in the Shanghai Public Concession and would not change its previous attitude.</p>
<p>Meeting of Three Countries' Military Officers Yesterday</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, an important meeting was held at the British military headquarters on Rue Dufour (now North Shaanxi Road) at 11:00 AM yesterday. Military officials from the US defense forces and the Japanese army visited Major General Simmons, the British military commander, one after another. It is widely believed that the military leaders of the US, Britain, and Japan conducted a preliminary discussion on the issue of taking over the defense zone after the British withdrawal. According to inquiries with other relevant parties, senior military officers from the US and Japan visited British military commander Major General Simmons at 10:00 AM yesterday morning to inquire about the British troop withdrawal and not to hold a meeting.</p>
<p>Foreign Defense Forces to Meet Next Week</p>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press", after the British announcement of their withdrawal from Shanghai, it is expected that the commanders of the foreign defense forces stationed in Shanghai will hold a meeting early next week to revise the defense zones of the various military forces in the Public Concession. The British military headquarters in Shanghai recently issued a notice stating that all outstanding debts of the British troops stationed in Shanghai should be settled within one week. Therefore, it is expected that the British troops will leave Shanghai next week. News was received in Shanghai this morning that the British War Office announced the withdrawal of the West Yorkshire Regiment and the East Surrey Regiment, which caused quite a shock, as British troops have been stationed in Shanghai along with troops from other countries since 1927.</p>
<p>Normal Defense Duties Before Withdrawal</p>
<p>A spokesman for the British troops stationed in Shanghai told reporters this morning that the exact date of the withdrawal of the two British battalions from Shanghai has not yet been announced. However, at present, British troops will continue to perform their duties and be stationed in their respective defense zones as usual. The British troop withdrawal is a "natural action" in the current European war.</p>
<p>Italian Troops to Remain in Shanghai for Now</p>
<p>According to British Consul-General in Shanghai, George, he has already responded to the request of "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an to withdraw the troops of the warring nations stationed in Shanghai. He has not yet informed Fu of this decision by the British War Office. However, when the official date of the British troops' departure is announced, he may formally notify Fu. This morning, reporters asked Lieutenant Colonel Morante, commander of the Italian Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai, whether the approximately 300 Italian troops stationed in Shanghai would also leave Shanghai soon. He replied that he had not received any instructions from his superiors, so the Italian troops would remain for the time being.</p>
<p>Volunteer Corps and Russian Troops to Take Over Hongkou</p>
<p>Regarding the redeployment, it is rumored that after the British troops leave Shanghai, the western Hongkou defense zone guarded by the British soldiers of the West Yorkshire Regiment will be taken over by the Volunteer Corps and the Russian Detachment. The defense duties in the area along the Shanghai-West Railway, within the vicinity of the Western District, along Avenue du President Doumer and Avenue Joffre, currently guarded by the British soldiers of the East Surrey Regiment, will continue to change.</p>
<p>US Military to Take Over Shanghai West Area</p>
<p>Rumors say that the defense along the Shanghai west border will be taken over by the US 4th Marine Regiment. However, this has not been confirmed, and US Marine Corps officers have refused to make any comments. As for how the US military will be assigned to defense duties in the Public Concession, it will be decided by Colonel Baker, commander of the US Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai. This morning, the Shanghai Municipal Council and the "Municipal Government" did not criticize the British troop withdrawal from Shanghai. Officials from the US and Japanese consulates in Shanghai also declined to comment.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Believes it is an Opportunity</p>
<p>Only the Japanese side said that the spokesperson of the Japanese Foreign Ministry in Tokyo may issue a statement today. Furthermore, the Japanese-language "Continental News" published in Shanghai this morning stated that after the withdrawal of the British troops stationed in Shanghai and North China, the British defense zone in Shanghai should be transferred to the Japanese authorities. Judging from the current "real situation here," there is no problem with this move. As the European situation becomes increasingly critical, Britain is forced to drastically change its Far East policy. Regardless of the reasons for the British troop withdrawal, one thing is certain: the British authorities have accepted the Japanese demand that the European warring nations withdraw their armed forces stationed in the occupied areas of China to avoid unforeseen events.</p>
<p>Investigation of British Military Units in Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the "North-China Daily News", Major General Simmons, the commander of the British forces in China, officially announced last night (9th) that the British forces currently stationed in Shanghai and North China would be withdrawn. The British troops withdrawing from Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beijing in accordance with this order include: (1) the 2nd Battalion of the East Surrey Regiment, the regular battalion currently stationed in Shanghai; (2) the 1st Battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment, normally stationed in Hong Kong and currently temporarily stationed here; (3) a detachment of the Army Medical Corps, with its headquarters currently located at the British Military Hospital on Central Road; (4) a detachment of the Army Service Corps, with its headquarters located at the Auching Barracks; (5) several detachments of engineers, signal corps, military police, and staff corps, with their headquarters located at the Duffour Road Barracks; (6) the Army Pay Corps and the Dental Corps.</p>
<p>Nursing Section Also Currently in Shanghai</p>
<p>A British military officer replied to reporters last night that he had no further comments to add to Major General Simmons's announcement. It is reported that the British troops in North China who are about to withdraw from Tianjin and Beijing are part of the 2nd Battalion of the East Surrey Regiment. After the departure of the Douchant Light Infantry, which was previously stationed in North China, the number of British troops in the area was reduced. Later, a company of the East Surrey Regiment was sent to take over the defense. In addition, there is a part of the affiliated military nursing team, which is also currently stationed in Shanghai.</p>
<p>First Withdrawal in Thirteen Years</p>
<p>After the British troops leave Shanghai this time, it will be the first time since 1927 that there will be no regular British troops stationed in Shanghai. Before 1927, with the exception of the Boxer Rebellion and the Taiping Rebellion, Shanghai did not have British troops stationed for a long time. Famous British regiments that have been stationed in Shanghai in the past include the Coldstream Guards and the Scots Guards. Many of them later served in the Shanghai Municipal Police.</p>
<p>Officers Stationed in Shanghai are Renowned</p>
<p>General Lord Gort, who was the commander of the British Expeditionary Force during the Battle of Flanders in the current European war and is now the Inspector General of Military Training, was stationed in Shanghai in 1927 and served as the chief of staff to General Duncan, commander of the British Sherwood Foresters. Captain Ivan Andrews, who was awarded the Victoria Cross for his meritorious service during the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force from Dunkirk, also served in Shanghai with the East Lancashire Regiment. The current commander of the East Surrey Regiment stationed in Shanghai is Lieutenant Colonel Swinton, and the commander of the West Yorkshire Regiment is Lieutenant Colonel Mawley. Major General Simmons was originally the commander of the British forces in Palestine and was transferred to become the commander of the British forces in China, succeeding Major General Smirles, who was transferred to become the Governor of Guernsey (which is currently occupied by German forces).</p>
<p>Strengthening the Strength of British Forces in the Far East</p>
<p>According to news from London, the British troops who are about to withdraw from Shanghai and North China will be used to strengthen the strength of other British forces stationed in the Far East. The British troops stationed in Shanghai are skilled in various sports and proficient in soccer and hockey.</p>
<p>Original Defense Zones of Various Foreign Forces</p>
<p>The area of the Public Concession west of North Henan Road, south of Suzhou Creek, and east of Yu Qiaqing Road is the area of the British military and the Volunteer Corps. The area of the extended road construction southwest of Avenue Joffre, south of Suzhou Creek, east of Avenue du President Doumer, north of Lujiazhai Road, and west of Edinburgh Road is the British military area. The area of the Public Concession west of Yu Qiaqing Road, east of Jiaozhou Road, Hart Road, and Avenue Joffre is the US military area.

<p>The Italian merchant ship Changde, belonging to the Rowbotham trading company, loaded cargo and set sail from Shanghai on the 7th of this month, heading for Gulong. Due to the small size of the ship, it sailed close to the coast, and mistakenly entered the Japanese naval warning line in the Dazhiyang area, resulting in its detention by a Japanese warship. This situation was reported in yesterday's newspaper. The ship has now been released and arrived at Gulong yesterday morning. As for the Fuxing small steamer, which was detained and taken to Songdou at the same time, there is no news yet as to whether it has been released.</p>

It is scheduled to sail there on the 12th (Monday) to load cargo, and has already handled customs clearance procedures at the Jianghai Customs. The customs clearance destination is only Gulong River, but the onshore inspection there is very strict.

As for receiving urgent telegrams from the French government, he said that he had no knowledge of it.</p>

<p>In order to ensure the security of the concessions in light of the approaching anniversary of the "August 13th" Shanghai battle, the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession have announced the implementation of special security measures. At 5:00 AM on the 9th, large numbers of laborers were assigned to build multiple sandbag fortifications (semi-circular) in front of the Shen Bao newspaper office on Shandong Road and Hankou Road, the Thames newspaper office on Avenue Edward VII, the Great Evening News newspaper office, the Sino-American Daily News newspaper office, the lane entrance of the Sino-American Daily News printing house in Changgeng Lane on Avenue Edward VII, and in front of the North-China Daily News newspaper office on the Bund, under the supervision of police officers. Detectives and defense forces were assigned to guard them closely.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Rumors Say Japan Will Lift Some Restrictions on Coastal Shipping - But Some Say Shimada Issued a Declaration Yesterday, Expanding the Blockade of the Fujian Coast <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>According to the "North-China Daily News", shipping circles claimed yesterday (9th) that the Japanese naval authorities may lift some of the restrictions imposed on Chinese coastal shipping within two weeks. It is reported that the Japanese side implemented this ban on July 16, completely blocking Chinese coastal shipping, except for the direct routes between North China ports and Hong Kong and Shanghai. Those operating on these two routes are ships of large shipping companies, so small companies have actually ceased operations.</p>
<p>Part of Military Operations Completed</p>
<p>The Japanese authorities explained that this ban was necessary for military reasons, and that the navy was concentrating its actions on ports such as Wenzhou, Ningbo, and Zhenhai. It was learned yesterday that military operations in some ports have now been completed, so the ban may be lifted sooner.</p>
<p>Merchants Have Suffered Huge Losses</p>
<p>The losses suffered by shipping companies are insignificant compared to the Chinese merchant food stores in Shanghai that sell local products from coastal ports. The Shaoxing wine, Chen wine, Wenzhou ham, and fruits from various ports in South China stored in Shanghai are gradually decreasing and cannot be replenished.</p>
<p>Some Say the Fujian Coast is Expanded Blockade</p>
<p>According to another report, Vice Admiral Shimada Shigeru, commander-in-chief of the Japanese fleet stationed in China, issued a declaration at noon on August 10, expanding the blockade of the Fujian coast. Based on the needs of combat operations, a declaration was issued on July 15 prohibiting ships from sailing in many places along the Zhejiang and Fujian coasts (including ships of third countries). Now, navigation is further prohibited in the following locations on the Fujian coast, starting from 00:00 on August 15: The area from Kere Island and Chimmo Point on the Fujian coast, through Highcone, Pinghai, Dazuo Cape, to the Shenhu line, including Xinghua Bay, Pinghai Bay, Meizhou Port, Xipu, Quanzhou Port, Shenhu Port, and other sea areas.</p>
<p>Shanghai Shipping Companies Have Not Received Confirmation</p>
<p>However, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. has learned that the company has not received this news. However, the company's Shenhua and Shenyou steamers, which sailed from Shanghai to Fujian in early August, arrived at Sanjiangkou in Xinghua. It was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai immediately, but there is still no news of their departure. It is still difficult to know whether we are being blocked from coming to Shanghai. The blockade line announced by the Japanese this time is: (1) From Hushan in Hangzhou Bay to the vertical line of Shenjiamen to the Feishan Islands to Juexi in Xiangshan Port, the blockade line is for the Zhenhai Port area; (2) From Yueqing to Qianshan to Pingyang and above, the blockade line is for the Ou River Estuary area. The blocked area is very wide. For example, the Zhejiang East Longshan, Xiepu, Ligang, Zhenhai, Daxie Mountain, Chuanshan, Cengang, Xiangshan Port, Hangzhou Bay, and Liuheng Mountain are all blocked. The purpose is obviously to block shipping.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Starting This Morning, Security Measures are Tightened - Police Guard the Security of the Concessions - Military Police and Teams Throughout the City are Deployed for Defense - Traffic Restrictions are More Severe Than Last Year - Japanese Military Live Fire Drills, Citizens Need Not Panic <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the implementation of security measures by the police authorities around the third anniversary of the "August 13th" Shanghai Battle. The foreign defense forces, Volunteer Corps, White Russian Detachment, and special constables worked together with the police to maintain order. Since last night, the Public Concession has deployed more patrolmen to perform duties within the concession. In addition to the full mobilization of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps and the White Russian Detachment, various defensive measures are still being actively deployed. It is said that the security situation will become even more stringent starting today. It is understood that only a small portion of the defense forces and Volunteer Corps participated in the security measures in the past two days. The members of the various units that were called up, such as the Chinese company of the regiment, concentrated at the Volunteer Corps barracks in the Municipal Council Building. A Battalion concentrated in the racetrack, and B Battalion concentrated at the Shanghai Club. However, starting at 5:00 AM this morning, all armed members waiting for orders will be deployed for defense, and it has been decided to rotate the defense forces every two hours. The number of British, American, French, and Italian defense forces deployed will also be increased compared to the past two days. More troops will also be stationed at the road intersections of all key points within the border to strengthen security.</p>
<p>Cutting off Traffic</p>
<p>Yesterday, barriers were set up to block traffic on various unimportant roads such as Avenue Edward VII, Chongqing Road, and Chengdu Road. Iron barbed wire fences and patrol vehicles were set up at various passages along Yu Qiaqing Road, such as the British Concession Sichuan Road and Sanmaoge Bridge. A large number of Chinese and foreign detectives were stationed to inspect pedestrians. In the French Concession, barricades and tanks were also set up on Avenue Foch, Dongxinqiao, Xinbeimen, Rue du Consulat, and the Bund, and armed detectives were stationed. Traffic was cut off at the Big Clock Tower. The foreign defense forces also continued to be deployed, patrolling the streets in armored vehicles or on foot. These strict security measures will be lifted before the morning of the 14th, but may be extended if deemed necessary to maintain security.</p>
<p>Security in Shanghai West</p>
<p>In order to maintain the security of the "August 13th" anniversary, the Public Concession authorities have taken more comprehensive security measures in the Shanghai West area, which is considered to be a hotbed of crime. According to the results of an inspection by a Daguan News Agency reporter who took a car to the area yesterday, iron barbed wire fences have been set up at the intersections of Daxi Road, Dufour Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Avenue Haig, Connaught Road, and Jiaozhou Road. Many detectives were stationed next to the fences, and they strictly searched pedestrians. Six or seven Italian defense forces soldiers were also standing on both sides with guns. At the same time, there were defense force gun vehicles patrolling back and forth, and the security was very tight.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Exercises</p>
<p>The Japanese Naval Landing Force stationed in Shanghai, on the occasion of the upcoming anniversary of the "August 13th" Shanghai Battle, conducted security exercises in the area north of Suzhou Creek, west of the north-south livestock market, south of the east-west Xuejiazhuang line, and east of the north-south mint starting last night (10th). They fired blanks starting at 0:00 this morning, and did not stop until dawn. The Japanese side had notified the surrounding residents in advance that they were not allowed to enter the area near the exercise site. At the railway gates in the Nanshi area, the barbed wire entrances in Zhabei and Hongkou, and the wharves in Pudong and the west of the South Huangpu and Suzhou Creek, the number of Japanese military police has been increased from four to eleven or twelve. Before trains arrive at the station or are about to depart, armored vehicles (ten people per vehicle) are dispatched with machine guns to patrol in front.</p>

<h3 id="e76">After Efforts by the Shanghai Municipal Council, Flour Prices Fall - Supply Gradually Becomes Abundant and Panic is Reduced - Hope for Verification and Reporting of Hoarding and Speculation <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Price Investigation Office recently issued its second public announcement, stating that among the various issues handled by the office since the publication of the first public announcement, the most important one was domestic flour. The office has no control over various aspects of transporting domestic wheat to Shanghai, so the supply of wheat was abnormal. As a result, most of the major flour mills in the concessions reduced production. The price of flour, which had hovered around 14 yuan per bag, rose to 15.8 yuan per bag, and the prices varied. Most bakeries also found it difficult to purchase flour.</p>
<p>Improving the Flour Market</p>
<p>In order to prevent hoarding and prevent further price increases, the office once cooperated with various flour mills and wholesale merchants to discuss ways to supply legitimate needs, and the selling price should not exceed 15.5 yuan per bag. This was quite effective. However, by mid-July, there was a serious shortage of flour. Although bakeries paid a price of 16 to 16.3 yuan per bag, they only obtained half of their daily needs. The office consulted again, and as a result, the flour market, which had once experienced extreme panic, was greatly improved. Currently, domestic wheat is being transported to Shanghai again, and the price is also cheaper. The price of flour has also fallen to 15 yuan per bag, and it is expected to continue to decline in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Worker Living Expenses Index for July This Year <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Due to military operations in Zhejiang and Fujian, the blockade of the Yunnan-Vietnam and Yunnan-Burma highways, restrictions on imports in the Nanyang region, and the shrinking market for Shanghai-produced goods, on the one hand, prices in the city are falling. On the other hand, the prices of daily necessities transported to Shanghai from the aforementioned areas are also affected. Since the speculative frenzy in May, Shanghai's industry has shifted from abnormal prosperity to a period of decline. However, the increase in retail prices continues unabated, becoming unbearable for the average citizen. With fewer outlets for manufactured goods and rising retail prices, the result is a sharp decline in sales of general merchandise. This trend is expected to continue or even worsen in the coming days.</p>
<p>The following table compares the average prices of five categories and fifty-eight items in July with the previous month and calculates the percentage increase or decrease:</p>
<p>Shanghai Worker Living Expenses Index for July, Year 29</p>
<p>New Base Period: Average of 1936 (Republic Year 25) equals 100</p>
<p>Index</p>
<p>Category Index  July, Year 28  July, Year 29</p>
<p>Food  178.04  485.80</p>
<p>Rent  282.41  348.19</p>
<p>Clothing  163.21  326.79</p>
<p>Fuel  176.81  444.62</p>
<p>Miscellaneous  149.96  404.79</p>
<p>Overall Index  188.56  449.18</p>
<p>Percentage Decrease Compared to 1936 Average (1)  (1) 46.97  (1) 77.74</p>
<p>Note: This index is based on the living standards of workers in the pre-war year of 1936. Recently, due to rising costs, living standards have declined.</p>
<p>Family Bread</p>
<p>Regarding the production and sale of "family bread," since the last public announcement appealed for support from all sectors, the number of telephone and written inquiries received has been considerable. After providing detailed instructions, the sales of this bread have significantly increased. Currently, approximately 1,800 pounds are sold daily in the International Settlement.</p>
<p>Disciplinary Actions</p>
<p>Furthermore, the collection of information regarding other daily necessities has progressed smoothly. The department has also held multiple meetings with industry associations and representatives of retail stores to discuss the issue of reasonable profits for each industry. Since July 19th, there have been no fewer than eleven cases of stores being prosecuted for failing to comply with the bureau's regulations regarding the labeling of prices. There have been fifteen cases of hawkers being prosecuted for using substandard weighing equipment. Subsequently, the names of hawkers found guilty will be posted in the respective菜場 (vegetable markets) for public knowledge. There have been two reported cases of inflated prices, both of which have been investigated. One case, involving bread supplied to refugee organizations, was found to be inaccurate. The other case involved coal balls, which was found to be true. After a warning, the price has been adjusted.</p>
<p>Cooperative Fair Prices</p>
<p>Finally, the department still hopes that citizens from all walks of life will cooperate. Reports of hoarding and profiteering must specify particular circumstances and include substantial evidence. Otherwise, vague accusations will not be helpful. The department's office is located at 223 Hankou Road, telephone number 12410.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Eighth Period of Fair-Price Coal Balls Begins Today: 59 Locations in Two Settlements <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The eighth period of fair-price coal balls, organized by the Coal Ball Industry Association, has been decided and will begin today. Each five and a half 市斤 (catty) will be sold for three 角 (dimes) in national currency. Fifty-nine locations will be set up in the two settlements. The police departments of both settlements will dispatch detectives to provide protection. Citizens purchasing coal balls must strictly adhere to order.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Xikou Bombed <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Xikou Town in Fenghua, the hometown of Chairman Chiang, has facilities such as the Wuling School and a bus station. The architecture of buildings such as the Wenchang Pavilion is also quite impressive. Unfortunately, it was bombed by Japanese planes years ago. A portion of Xikou Town's streets were also destroyed. Unexpectedly, yesterday (9th) at approximately 9:00 AM, three Japanese planes intruded into Xikou and dropped bombs twice, totaling eight bombs. The locations where the bombs landed were: 1. Three bombs hit the Huling Hotel, causing minimal damage. 2. Five bombs landed in a vacant lot behind the bus station, causing no damage. The Wuling Hotel is built on a mountain with beautiful scenery. After the Xi'an Incident, Zhang Xueliang once lived in seclusion here before leaving after the outbreak of war. It is a place of historical significance. The Xikou bus station is close to Ningbo on one side, i.e., the Ningbo-Fenghua Road, and connected to Jinhua on the other side, i.e., the Jinhua-Xikou Joint Transportation Highway. Except for the Ningbo-Fenghua Road, which was destroyed early on, the Jinhua-Xikou Road is still open. This bombing caused no damage because the bombs landed on vacant land, so the road is still open to traffic, and transportation between Ningbo and Jinhua is not hindered.</p>
<p>Ningbo Association Relief Funds Arrive in Town</p>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association remitted 30,000 yuan to Mr. Jiang Zaitian in Zhenhai to handle relief and comfort for disaster victims. The funds have already arrived, as reported by Mr. Jiang via telegram. At the same time, County Magistrate Zhou of Zhenhai also sent a telegram on behalf of the disaster victims to express their gratitude. However, the relief funds are still insufficient, and they hope that Shanghai will continue to raise funds for assistance. The Zhenhai refugee shelter has now been expanded to three locations, housing over 800 refugees in the largest and over 200 in the smallest. Due to the war, all the houses in the Jiangnan area have been destroyed and are now ruins. Many disaster victims from that area have come to Zhenhai in search of food, and the situation is extremely dismal.</p>

<p>Lawyer Chen Wenxiang, residing at 247 Xinzha Road, has two sons and one daughter, named Yaomei, Jingmei, and Furong, all of whom are grown. Furong is married to Pan Bingyan, an employee of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department from Ningbo, and lives with him at 4 Longxin Lane, North Jiangxi Road. Recently, a rift has developed between the brothers-in-law due to a debt issue. On the 26th of last month, Furong reported to the Xinzha Police Station that she had been beaten by her two younger brothers at her mother's house, requesting her husband Pan Bingyan to do so. After an investigation by Chinese Detective Ma Derong, it was determined to be a family dispute and was not accepted. Chen Yaomei and Chen Jingmei, believing that their brother-in-law had falsely accused them, hired a lawyer to file a self-accusation of false accusation with the First Special Court Criminal Division. After the judge summoned and questioned the parties involved, he ordered that Detective Ma Derong be summoned to court for further verification. A continued hearing was held yesterday morning. According to the defendant Pan Bingyan's testimony, on the 26th of last month at 11:30 AM, I received a call in my writing room from Chen Yaomei, stating that my sister Furong had suddenly died at their home. I then asked my supervisor for leave and reported it to the Xinzha Police Station, and the detectives rushed to Chen's house, where Furong was alive and well and had not died. Later, the detectives took Chen Yaomei and others to the police station, etc. Detective Ma Derong then narrated everything, and his testimony was similar to Pan's. After reviewing the police station's report form, the judge acquitted Pan Bingyan and Pan Chen Furong.</p>

Yesterday morning, after questioning by Judge Xiao, Zheng Lian'gen was found guilty of causing death through negligence and sentenced to two years in prison as a warning.</p>
<h3 id="e85">May's Trade Surplus Exceeds 9 Million; Domestic Exports Led by the United States <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Since the sudden outbreak of the European War, China's foreign trade has improved. From January to April of this year, the trade deficit has been decreasing daily. By May, it had turned into a trade surplus. The total value of domestic exports in May reached 22,552,7314 yuan. After deducting the value of imported native goods, which was 371,129 yuan, the net value was 22,515,6185 yuan. The net value of imported foreign goods was 21,602,060 yuan. By comparing these two, the total value of exports exceeded the value of imports by 9,154,125 yuan. Taking the five months into consideration, the total value of China's foreign trade this year reached 155,559 million yuan, increased from 91,127,4369 yuan in the same period last year. The trade surplus increased by more than 64.4 million yuan. The figures of trade deficit in the first five months of this year were only slightly more than 17.57 million. From the numbers stated above, the improving foreign trade conditions are very clear. From January to May, exports to the United States were the highest, reaching 122,517,000 yuan. Hong Kong was second, reaching 17,754 million yuan. The United Kingdom was third, at 70 million yuan. In May, export figures show that the United States occupied first place, with a total value of 63,765,000 yuan. Hong Kong was second, with a total value of 44,825,000 yuan. The United Kingdom was third, with a total value of slightly more than 27,694,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The labor dispute between the British-owned Shanghai Power Company and its workers seemed to be showing some progress after numerous mediations by Yu Qiaqing. However, the company's attitude suddenly became firm yesterday, causing the situation to stagnate again. Yu Qiaqing visited the company's chairman, Mr. Kadoorie, yesterday to mediate. According to Kadoorie, the company insists on terminating the employment of twenty staff members and thirteen workers and stated that wages would be suspended for the period of the strike. He also said that over one hundred Chinese had provided bank guarantees to the company, and the salaries of the twelve Westerners employed in the factory and twenty in the office were equal to those of the Chinese, but each Westerner's work efficiency was equivalent to that of two Chinese. Yu asked the company to reconsider and then left. It is said that he will meet with Kadoorie again tomorrow.</p>

<p>The China Press reports that it has learned that if the curfew passes obtained by citizens for commercial purposes are abused, they will be confiscated by the authorities. Anyone who uses a pass to go to entertainment venues such as taverns and gambling dens for purposes other than legitimate business and is found leaving such venues will no longer be entitled to hold a curfew pass. It is also heard that foreign and Chinese taverns in the city are expected to comply with curfew regulations from August 9th to 14th and close earlier so that customers can return home before 12:30 AM. If any tavern receives a warning and still does not obey the order, the authorities will take action against it. Since the strict implementation of the curfew on Thursday, special patrol teams of Chinese police officers have been arresting loiterers after 12:30 AM, with approximately 300 people being detained at the Central Police Station every night.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Owner of Zhikang Cotton Cloth Store Forges Domestic Goods Certificate; Defendant Implicates Others in Continued Hearing Yesterday Afternoon; Defendant Ordered to Provide Original Guarantee and Rescheduled for Further Hearing <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Chen Yongsen, owner of Zhikang Cotton Cloth Store at 20 South Yangqiao, Baier Road, was recently sued by He Bodian, manager of Yongtaixiang Cotton Cloth Store in Qingyuan Lane, Beijing Road, who hired lawyer Mao Xianshen to file a lawsuit with the Second Special Court Criminal Division, accusing him of forging a domestic goods certificate from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and committing fraud and breach of trust. A civil lawsuit was also attached, seeking compensation for losses of 27,840 yuan. After Judge Li Weishan summoned the parties and ordered the defendant Chen Yongsen to provide bail and be summoned again, the details were previously reported in the newspaper. Since the case occurred, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has not only published a notice of investigation but also sent personnel to investigate the truth, and the situation has invisibly escalated. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the continued hearing. The defendant argued that he had entrusted Wu Xianglin of Peili Company to apply for the domestic goods certificate from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, so he did not know whether it was genuine or fake. After the plaintiff contacted him, he reported it to the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Station on July 9th and asked them to arrest Wang, but Wang had already fled to Hongkou. This matter has nothing to do with him. At this point, the plaintiff's representative, lawyer Mao, stated to the court that to apply for a domestic goods certificate from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the relevant industry association must be present to sign and issue it. Now the defendant only claims to have entrusted someone Wang to apply on his behalf, which is misleading to the court and constitutes the crime of colluding in fraud. After reviewing the statements, the court ordered the defendant to provide the original guarantee and adjourned the hearing indefinitely for further investigation.</p>

<p>Kidnapper Xie Yongsheng from Pudong and others conspired with several others who are still at large to invade the residence of farmer Zhou Alou in Hangtou, Nanhui County, late at night on the 3rd of last month, using weapons to kidnap Zhou Alou's seven-year-old son Zhou Hongquan and brought him to Shanghai, hiding him in Room 26 of the Dongchang Inn at 398 Lane, Avenue Joffre. They sent a letter asking Zhou's family to send someone to Shanghai to negotiate a ransom of 20,000 yuan. Detective Qian Xianting of the Central Police Station learned of the plan and instructed the contact person to take 10,000 yuan in ghost money to the gate of the Guanghua Theater on Avenue Edward, according to the agreed location, to meet with the robbers and pay the ransom. The detectives took the opportunity to step forward and arrest the ringleader Xie Yongsheng and others. Based on their confessions, the hostage was rescued, and they were sent to the First Special Court for prosecution on charges of kidnapping.

<h3 id="e94">Can Britain Switch to the Offensive? <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Those concerned about the European war now have a question: If Hitler cannot unleash a blitzkrieg against Britain, can Britain launch an offensive against Germany?</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Churchill has already stated that Britain's military plan is not limited to defending against a German invasion. US Secretary of War Stimson also said that the Allies' biggest mistake was initially deciding to adopt a passive policy.</p>
<p>The scale of the defenses that Britain has deployed is truly astonishing. Although the British military authorities are constantly waiting for a German invasion, they have at least taken a temporary offensive. This is especially evident in the air force.</p>
<p>For weeks, the German air force has been continuously bombing Britain, but the British air force has also been constantly flying to Germany to attack. In terms of the results of the battle, although the British Air Force Ministry has exaggerated the losses suffered by the enemy and covered up the damage to its own country, neutral observers report that the intensity of British air raids on German territory is actually greater than that of German aircraft.</p>
<p>As for the reason, it is currently impossible to determine whether it is because British aircraft repeatedly penetrated deep into German territory for reconnaissance last winter, so they know German territory like the back of their hand, or because German air force pilots are not very accurate when dropping bombs at night. However, the recent implementation of daytime air raids by German aircraft seems to prove that the second reason is closer to the truth. British aircraft have also been flying to enemy countries, such as the coastal airfields of France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, and various locations in Germany, to intensify the offensive.</p>
<p>Control of the sea still rests with the British Navy. The German fleet is closed in the harbor, the Italian fleet does not dare to engage in battle, and a large portion of the French fleet has been dealt with, and the French coast has been blockaded.</p>
<p>But this situation is only temporary. The leading position in large-scale offensives still belongs to Germany, not Britain. The deployment of British land and sea forces is still mainly defensive. The offensive taken by the air force is just a counterattack, not a prelude to an all-out offensive.</p>
<p>Recognize the current situation and make a straightforward deduction: Britain is unable to launch an offensive until two preparations have been completed. The so-called two preparations: First, it must gain air superiority; second, it must quickly catch up and enrich its motorized army groups, so that their strength is sufficient to launch a large-scale offensive into enemy territory.</p>
<p>First, in terms of air superiority, when the German army launched a blitzkrieg against Belgium and France, the Allied forces were defeated beyond redemption due to the disparity in the number of aircraft. British factories have recently been able to step up manufacturing, and they have indeed recovered a lot from this tragic disadvantage in the number of aircraft. As for fighter pilots and air force warriors, Britain still maintains a qualitative advantage.</p>
<p>Next, in terms of mechanized equipment, manufacturing has also been accelerated since last month, but the results are not yet known. What is certain is that Britain was completely unprepared for this when the war began last September, and only began to step up manufacturing in mid-May of this year. In the Battle of Flanders, it lost almost everything again. Up to now, it can be said that it still does not have sufficient mechanized equipment to undertake an offensive.</p>
<p>Therefore, the answer to the question of whether Britain can switch to the offensive depends half on Britain's own efforts and half on the assistance of the United States and the various parts of the British Empire. If Britain's production volume can be unimpeded by continuous bombing by German aircraft, then given time, Britain will be able to create a large number of aircraft, tanks, artillery, and other equipment for use in launching an offensive. But this situation is impossible. Therefore, whether Britain can gain air superiority and mechanized forces is determined by the assistance of the United States and the various parts of the British Empire.</p>
<p>Most military experts agree that Britain must break Germany's air power before it can send troops to land in front of the enemy. The current air raids and occasional naval battles cannot save the war.</p>
<p>However, according to reliable sources, although Britain is currently taking a defensive position, it has no intention of staying that way forever. The British military authorities are actively planning a general offensive against Germany. Secretary of War Eden strongly advocates taking an offensive, and the British staff and generals are also enthusiastically supporting his proposal. The only thing that is unknown is the timing.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Stalin's Successor, Zhdanov <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— r.L.</p>
<p>In recent years, at Soviet Communist Party public gatherings, we have often seen a short, stout man in his forties sitting beside the dictator Stalin. With a uniformly round "Russian" face, he sported a short beard. Stalin was very affectionate towards him, sometimes patting him on the shoulder, sometimes whispering a few words in his ear. Most Communist leaders have "laborious faces," but this round-faced man was a unique presence. In photos taken at public events, he always displayed the clever smile of someone with a carefree and comfortable life. This person is Andrei Alexandrovich Zhdanov.</p>
<p>In the mysterious and unpredictable Kremlin, every move of the Communist dictator, whether speaking or laughing, carries significant meaning. However, if someone were to ask what important position Zhdanov actually held, veteran foreign observers in Moscow, besides casually saying, "Ah, he's Stalin's adjutant," would not know his true background. Until recently, they made a surprising discovery. It turns out that Zhdanov has been "Stalin's successor" for at least four or five years. He was personally appointed by the dictator and evidently recognized by the Communist Party cadres. Even while Stalin is still alive, this "Number Two Red"—equivalent to Germany's "Number Two Leader," Göring—already wields considerable power on the Soviet political stage. Whether the Soviet Union will participate in the European war seems to depend on him. Therefore, it is no wonder that the diplomatic envoys of various European countries pay close attention to every word and action of Zhdanov.</p>
<p>Zhdanov's status as Stalin's "heir" has not been publicly announced. Like Stalin, he is not a fundamental official of the Soviet government. Only through interpersonal relationships and the relative closeness of those around Stalin, after a considerable amount of time and various special signs, was Zhdanov's true position and the importance of his future discovered. Stalin has also recently, intentionally or unintentionally, given hints about his succession, sometimes deliberately revealing some clues. At the graduation ceremony of a military academy, when raising a toast, everyone only shouted, "Long live Stalin and Zhdanov!" Zhdanov was recently also referred to as the "Supreme Naval Commissar," just as Stalin is the "Supreme Commissar" of the Red Army.</p>
<p>Besides these superficial characteristics, although Zhdanov is not a key member of the highest political organs in the Soviet Union, the real power he wields is extraordinary. In addition to the "People's Committee" and other top institutions, there is an inconspicuous ruling cadre within the Communist Party, in which Zhdanov's position is second only to Stalin. For example, he is currently the leader of the Leningrad Party Committee, wielding great power and honor. According to Communist Party practice, only the dictator's successor can enjoy such a position. Zhdanov assumed this position in 1934 after the assassination of the former leader of the Leningrad Party Committee, Kirov. Looking back, it is clear that Stalin regarded Kirov not only as a close friend but also as his natural successor.</p>
<p>The Soviet-Finnish War was directed by Zhdanov. In the summer of 1939, while Europe was still in an atmosphere of peace, Zhdanov openly stated, "Soviet Russia must obtain military bases in the Gulf of Finland and the Arctic Sea to ensure the security of Leningrad and the Murmansk railway." The demands on Finland were also drafted by him, and the failure of the Soviet-Finnish negotiations in November was orchestrated by him and Stalin. After the war began, he "single-handedly shouldered the burden," frequently traveling to the front lines to coordinate military operations.</p>
<p>Zhdanov is 44 years old this year, a well-built, medium-sized man, full of energy and vitality. He often works 14 to 15 hours a day. He was born in the Pskov province of northern Russia. His father was a poor church clerk. His early life is not well known. After the outbreak of the last European war, he dropped out of school to join the army and received the Imperial Russian Cross of St. George. After the 1917 revolution, he stood on the side of the Communist Party and participated in the civil war. His history of joining the party is not long; he began working within the party only after the civil war ended. It took him twelve years to rise from an "unknown soldier" to enter the inner sanctum of Communist Party power.</p>
<p>From 1914 to 1931, he engaged in genuine revolutionary work in the wilderness and fields, unlike other revolutionary leaders who remotely commanded from military headquarters or government residences in grand buildings. He witnessed the peasant revolution, the struggles of workers, and personally experienced the pain of hunger. All of this shaped his strong and resolute personality today. He is not particularly devoted to Leninism. Deep down, he is an opportunist who prioritizes expediency. He is a skilled speaker, shedding the "stale and verbose" clichés of the "old Communist Party." He uses sharp words, including lively and easily understood meanings. On the one hand, his round, smiling face shows great optimism; on the other hand, his sharp teeth and large fists represent a kind of barbaric aura of the Soviet ruling class. He gives young university students a good impression and inspires trust in them. The inhumane and terrible measures of the first year of the Soviet revolution were gradually improved thanks to his efforts.</p>
<p>Zhdanov's two important positions, Deputy Secretary-General of the Communist Party Central Committee (the Secretary-General being Stalin) and Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Foreign Affairs Committee, allow him to play a significant role in shaping Soviet foreign policy. The Soviet Foreign Minister, Molotov, is his close friend, and their cooperation is like adding wings to a tiger. Like many "new" party members, he is a fervent patriot and nationalist, reversing the style of the older generation like Trotsky, Zinoviev, and Bukharin, who regarded internationalism as their destination or only valued Communist theory. He has never lived abroad and has no interest in foreign laboring classes. His diplomatic creed is: "The foreign policy of our government aims at the welfare of the Soviet people." He does not ask about anything else. His motivation for the war against Finland was based on this. The resignation of Foreign Minister Litvinov, an internationalist, a year ago was also due to his exclusion. The bombshell German-Soviet pact of August 23, 1939, was also facilitated by Zhdanov.</p>
<p>The German-Soviet pact was initiated on June 19, 1939, when Zhdanov published an article saying that the British and French negotiations with the Soviet Union "lacked sincerity" and were nothing more than provoking Germany and the Soviet Union to fight each other. The Soviet Union should stop negotiations and reconcile with Germany. After August 23, London and Paris realized that Stalin was actually speaking through Zhdanov's mouth. Subsequently, they began to pay attention to this "successor."</p>
<p>Zhdanov has no particular inclination towards Britain, France, or Germany; he only favors Soviet Russia. He once said, "Britain and France hope that Soviet Russia will fight but offer no benefits to it; Germany does not ask it to fight but gives it a large piece of former Russian land. The decision between these two is certainly not difficult." From then on, the world knew that Zhdanov was a keen and frank nationalist.</p>
<p>What were Stalin's motives for choosing Zhdanov as his "successor"?</p>
<p>The "Red Party Dictator" is now 61 years old. His health is said to be strong, but he has endured more hardships and dangers than ordinary people can know. Perhaps he will not live much longer. At the same time, his close associates, Molotov, Voroshilov, and Beria, are also eagerly awaiting the selection of Stalin's successor and hoping for an early arrangement.</p>
<p>If Stalin were to die without an "heir," and everyone were to compete for the vacant "throne," these people would not only be in great danger but might even lose their lives. Indeed, the fact that Lenin died without a successor seventeen years ago was a big mistake. After a long period of strife, Stalin seized his "throne." Other people, such as Zinoviev, Kamenev, and Bukharin, almost all became Stalin's enemies and were executed by firing squad. Moreover, the current conspicuous phenomenon is that if Stalin withdraws to the west without a successor, then various conspiracies of suspicion and seizure will arise immediately, even messing up his own position.</p>
<p>Stalin has a grown son, who works as an engineer, from his divorced ex-wife. The relationship between father and son is very bad. This son lives far from Moscow and never meets his father. Stalin's second wife, Alliluyeva, passed away several years ago and had a son and a daughter, but both are minors. The person who inherits Stalin's position must be a mature, robust, and powerful man.</p>
<p>Zhdanov is undoubtedly an excellent candidate. It is said that Stalin was very pleased when he saw this young man at the age of thirty. Over the years, Zhdanov has always shown loyalty and firmness during Stalin's party purges, and he has made great efforts to eliminate reactionary elements within the Leningrad region. But strangely enough, he does not have many enemies. He is unlike other Communist leaders who have killed many people. His way of dealing with people is very fair and peaceful, and he can coordinate between different factions. Although he is married, he is very strict with himself, and no one speaks ill of him. Because of his simple Russian style and uncompromising nationalism, he is widely loved in the army and navy.</p>
<p>However, Zhdanov's status has not been formally announced to the public by Stalin. Indeed, before the public learns about his background, if Zhdanov were to plot against his dictator, Stalin could "remove" him quietly.</p>
<p>What will Zhdanov's fate be? Serving as Stalin's successor is full of thorns and dangers. The dictator Stalin is naturally suspicious. It is truly said, "Attending the monarch is like attending a tiger." Being with him, the outcome is still difficult to predict.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Rumors of Drought Demons <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Drought demons (旱魃) as scourges are found in the Book of Songs. This is, of course, an inauspicious creature, unseen by most of the world. Recently, I heard that people in Guangfu Mountain are spreading rumors that in the past month, whenever the stars and moon shine brightly, there is often a creature appearing on the mountaintop, squatting on the treetops. Its shape is like a human but not human, like a ghost but not a ghost. Its face and features are indistinguishable. It is only felt that its whole body is as white as lead. On its head, it wears a crown like an upturned bowl, and there is often white vapor rising upwards. The mountain people say in unison that since this creature appeared, there has been no rain for two months, so there is a widespread rumor of drought demons.</p>
<p>Excuse Me</p>
<p>In Tianjin, those who push small carts are called "cart handles" by the locals. When they ask people to make way, they say "Excuse me" (借光). However, they charge straight ahead, and pedestrians are often unable to dodge in time and are injured by them. On the fifteenth of last month, a small cart on the Dongfu Bridge rammed into a person, causing them to bleed. The victim argued with the "cart handle," who said, "I already said 'Excuse me.' You were careless yourself, so what are you complaining about?" and swaggered away. The injured person was furious. Just then, he saw a wooden pole by the roadside. He quickly grabbed it and chased after the cart pusher, randomly striking him on the buttocks. With each strike, he shouted "Excuse me." By the time the cart pusher released the cart and turned back, his buttocks were covered in swollen lumps. Onlookers all shouted with great delight.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Christ's Voluntary Sacrifice (1) <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Whenever we mention Jesus, we think of his death by crucifixion. As for the morality of his life, he was truly an unprecedented and unparalleled perfect man of all time. When we think of his tragic death, everyone sheds tears of sorrow. But Jesus himself said, "No one takes my life from me, but I lay it down of my own accord." Thus, his painful death was a voluntary sacrifice. What lessons does his voluntary sacrifice teach us?</p>
<p>(1) It teaches us what love is: We are not here to define love, nor to establish an object for love, nor to say how many limitations there are on the scope of love, but to talk about how much a person can do because of love? The extreme of love, like Jesus' love, is to willingly give up our lives for us. (John 15:13) The poet felt the insignificance of man and once asked, "What is man?" Man is truly insignificant! Especially those who commit crimes and do evil are even more insignificant! Man can be as high as angels, called saints, called gods, but can also fall to a position inferior to all things. The Son of God—Jesus, willingly sacrificed on the cross for people who are "insignificant," does this not let us know God's love?</p>
<p>(2) It teaches us what true friendship is: Jesus once said to his disciples, "This is my command: Love each other as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends…" (John 15:12) An ancient saying goes, "To have one close friend, even death is without regret." It can be seen that all human beings have the emotions of seeking friends. At the same time, we often know that it is very difficult for people to get a close friend. As for the friendship of risking one's life for a friend, there are even fewer. In this world, everyone needs friends. If he cannot find people to be friends with, he must regard birds, beasts, flowers, trees, as well as flowers and trees, as confidants, so that his emotions can be entrusted to them. Lin Hejing, the "plum wife and crane child," is a good example. However, everything in the world that can be regarded as a friend—animals, flowers, trees, music, books, etc.—ultimately cannot leave people permanently, and there are few friends who are truly willing to sacrifice for friends. Only Jesus loves the world and takes the world as a friend, and lays down his life for his friends.

<p>— Wang Cangping</p>
<p>Loving games is the nature of children and also a right they should enjoy, but on this island, their rights are being deprived. Living in cage-like houses, not to mention playing games, even joyful activities are being restricted. In most schools, even the courtyards have been made into classrooms, and lofts have also been built. After-school activities are like a carousel in a mess. Fresh sunlight and air are far from them. Sundays are originally good days for them. Going to the park can also stretch their stiff limbs, but many parents, because both tram and bus fares have risen and they have to buy tickets, are already overwhelmed by the expenses of firewood, rice, oil, and salt alone. For such games, they know it is beneficial, but they can only save on it. As a result, many children do not receive the benefits of nature throughout the year. In order to make up for this shortcoming, I will list my ideal children's welfare undertakings below:</p>
<p>Those who have private gardens, and larger schools that have larger sports fields, can stipulate that they will be lent to students of various primary schools without sports fields for a few days each week as a place for sports. (However, most owners who have a desire to occupy land are unwilling to accept this request and should find ways to unblock it universally) Establish children's libraries. People from all walks of life should raise funds based on their abilities, regardless of the size of the scale. In short, the more libraries, the better, but the selection of books must be done by experts. It is best to add a children's playroom in one corner of the reading room, so that after reading, they can play games, and both their mind and body can be pleasantly satisfied. Furthermore, each library should hold children's works exhibitions several times each year to promote children's interest in learning.</p>
<p>Advocate for children's movies. I think it is just as profitable as the normal stuff, as long as the boss of the film company invites a few directors and writers who know children's psychology well to engage in the production of children's films. There must be many materials to choose from, and business will definitely not be small, because there are no parents in the world who do not love their children, and parents will definitely not be deliberately stingy with their children's requests.</p>
<p>Major companies should strive to manufacture educational toys, which must have the conditions of enlightening knowledge and being fascinating, and profit should not be too high, so sales will definitely be smooth, and the effect of small profits and quick turnover will still be achieved. Radio stations should tell more children's stories. In terms of selection of materials, such as Qi Jiguang, Yue Fei, Sima Guang, etc., based on history, it is okay to be creative and use in-depth and clear techniques, plus many interesting insertions. Such stories are also very popular with women.</p>
<p>You can also use the radio station to hold children's speech competitions to stimulate children's thinking, and organize children's food production and sales cooperatives, because children's food is mostly purchased from street vendors, which is very harmful to hygiene. The products of the cooperative should be clean, nutritious, and cheap. Employ poor, refugee children, wearing uniforms, carrying food boxes, selling them along the streets, supplying fresh food needed by children throughout the city. The organizational law can be formulated by experts. Although the above points are my ideals, in a healthy society, they are indeed necessary. Shanghai is not short of enthusiastic people. I hope they will rise up and advocate for opening up happy gardens for these boring and dull children to cultivate their spirits and improve their lives. This is truly the happiness of society and the happiness of the country.</p>
<h3 id="e99">A Smart Old Man <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Chi Er</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was an old man walking on a narrow and long path. There were rivers on both sides of the path, and it was covered with weeds. He held a dry tobacco pipe, a dry tobacco pouch, and a box of matches in his hand, walking and smoking with great satisfaction. Unexpectedly, he threw a burning matchstick on the ground. The grass was dry, and it caught fire and burned quickly, spreading very quickly. When he saw it, he hurried forward, but the fire behind him, aided by the tailwind, followed him. He was so anxious at the time that he was at a loss. There were rivers on both sides, and he could not jump down. The fire behind him was coming so fast that he was so scared that he ran forward desperately. After running for a short time, he suddenly remembered that everything must be done calmly, otherwise it would be like a moth flying into the fire, courting its own destruction. So, he tried his best to calm his mind, suppressed his panicked attitude, and worked hard to use his brain. As a result, he really thought of a perfect solution. He hurriedly lit a match, threw it on the dry grass in front, and the grass in front caught fire and burned. He ran along with the fire in front. In this way, the fire behind him could not burn him.</p>
<p>Children, after reading such a story, you will definitely say in unison: "This old man is extremely smart!" and admire his resourcefulness. But what if a person encounters something difficult and does not panic at all? If you can calmly think of a way to deal with the environment, then there is no reason not to succeed. Look at the story in front, if the old man had not thought of a good way, how could he not have been burned to death? Therefore, it is useless to just be anxious without thinking of a solution.</p>
<p>Children! I urge you all not to panic when encountering things, you should be calm, because just panicking is the road to self-destruction.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Hurricane <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Su Ming</p>
<p>In the past few days, the newspaper has published news about hurricanes, "A hurricane has started in the Pacific Ocean. The wind is quite strong and is heading rapidly in the northwest-west direction. Whether Shanghai will be hit is being closely monitored by the observatory, and ships are warned…" Yonger saw this news and only half understood it. "Why is the hurricane like a specialty of the Pacific Ocean?" He asked his brother Zonger.</p>
<p>"Before answering your question, do you know how the wind happens? A hurricane is a type of wind, so the question you asked can also be solved." After Zonger finished speaking, Yonger shook his head to show that he did not know.</p>
<p>"The flow of air becomes wind, but how does air flow? This is entirely caused by the different air pressure. Because a portion of the air is affected by the increase in temperature and becomes very light, and the air nearby is not heated, so it is heavier. So it sinks down and pushes the light air up, thus causing air circulation, resulting in air flow, and there is wind. Shaking the fan will cause wind, that is man-made wind, and the reason is the same. The cause of natural wind is the change in air pressure, so why can air pressure change? When you burn a piece of wood, you can see the sparks go straight up. This phenomenon is because the heated air expands and becomes light, so there is a tendency to rise, and then the cold and heavy air from the surroundings comes to fill it, which becomes wind. For example, standing by the sea during the day, you only feel that the wind is blowing from the sea, because the air on land is easier to heat than the air on the water, so the air on the ground rises during the day, and the air blowing from the sea comes to fill it. Another type is caused by air vortices. This is because the sun heats the ground, so locally changes in air pressure occur, and the air flowing from the surroundings forms vortices. This is really like quickly rotating your hand in a water basin, and the water becomes a vortex. The center is very concave, so the closer to the center, the smaller the pressure. The situation of that vortex is exactly the same, but the air becomes water. Although the location of this vortex changes, it is still spinning. The size of the wind is determined by the comparison of the air pressure around and in the center of the vortex. If the air pressure in the center of the vortex is lower than the surrounding area, it is called low pressure. If it is higher than the surrounding area, it is called high pressure. Low pressure and high pressure are not fixed in one place, but gradually move forward, similar to the speed of a train, but high pressure is slower. When low pressure comes, it will rain. When high pressure arrives, a downward airflow will occur, and the air will descend near the ground, the water vapor will rise and disappear, the sky will clear, and the climate will feel cold. If the low pressure is too great, a storm will occur, and a hurricane is the greatest degree of low pressure. This type of low pressure is most likely to occur in the Pacific Ocean and the South Seas Islands, and its occurrence period is also fixed, always in July, August and September. The journey of a hurricane is mostly in the form of an oval, so the eastern provinces of our country and Japan are often hit by hurricanes, and the losses are of course very large."</p>

<p>They were all my loved ones, all whom I loved—but Dad was an exception, for he was the first and most loved of all. He is very happy now; but he also had unhappy times before. I remember when I first worked in short films, I heard Mom say to someone that I only earned forty or fifty yuan for each short film. My income was meager, and then some news came from the bank where Dad worked. He didn't explain to me what it was, but I heard him talking to Mom. Looking at his face, I knew the news was very bad. Finally, one day, he stayed home and didn't go to the bank. He never stayed home except on Sundays, so this was a strange thing to see for the first time. I asked him why he didn't go out? He said that President Roosevelt had ordered all banks to close, so he couldn't go to work anymore.</p>
<p>At that time, we were sitting in the garden of the old house in Santa Monica. I can't remember which day it was, only that it definitely wasn't Sunday. It was usually quiet in the garden except on Sundays, but I didn't know why. Dad and I were sitting on a bench outside my little playhouse. His face showed unhappiness, and he didn't know what to do. I was very uneasy and determined to cheer him up. I was about to climb onto Dad's lap and say, "Dad, I love you very much," but just then Mom came out of the house, hurrying us to go to the studio because it was getting late. So we got into Dad's car, and he drove us to the studio. I sat between my parents, and we didn't say much on the way. When we arrived at the studio gate, Mom and I got out of the car, and Dad forced a slight smile and said, "Even though he has nothing to do, at least one person in the Temple family is working!" Oh, he didn't know that good luck would befall us on Christmas of that year. If he had known in advance, he would have been very happy.</p>
<p>You see, a few months later, I was assigned to star in a great film! After it was released, I became a big Hollywood star like Janet Gaynor and Greta Garbo!</p>
<p>I'm telling you the story of how this happened, as many people have asked me before. They said, "Two years ago, no one had ever heard of Shirley Temple. Where did you suddenly come from?" Actually, my emergence wasn't sudden. I had been working hard in short films for some time, and fame doesn't come easily.</p>
<p>After Dad lost his job when the bank closed, Mom soon received news that we would no longer be making those "Baby Burlesks" short films. The director told her that we had made seven, but the audience didn't like them, they weren't as popular as the "Our Gang" comedies, so the results were mediocre. Besides, the children were growing up and no longer looked like babies.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Norma Shearer, Comet of the Film World - Today Is Her Thirty-Sixth Birthday <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Qinghui</p>
<p>Among movie stars, no one currently holds a higher position or enjoys a greater reputation than Norma Shearer. She has won the Academy Award for three consecutive years (1936 for "The Barretts of Wimpole Street," 1937 for "Romeo and Juliet," and 1938 for "Marie Antoinette"). She is truly a comet in the silver world! She was born on August 11, 1904, and today is exactly her thirty-sixth birthday. At the age of fifteen, she went to New York with her mother and two sisters. They wandered there for half a year without any success. Penniless, they learned that a film company was hiring twelve extras. They rushed to apply and were happily all hired. They could earn five dollars a day working. At that time, arc lights had not yet been invented, and filming relied on sunlight, so they became unemployed on cloudy days.</p>
<p>Two Failures</p>
<p>Soon after, she gained the favor of Irving Thalberg, the manager of Universal Studios, who agreed to sign her to a long-term contract. Later, Irving suddenly received a telegram from his father, saying that the lead actress in a film was ill. So Norma hurriedly traveled to New York again, only to find that the lead actress had recovered by the time she arrived, and Norma was unemployed again. At that time, she had briefly worked as an artist's model, but this was not a proper profession. Later, she got an opportunity and immediately devoted herself to the stage, gradually gaining popularity. Soon, she won the championship in a beauty contest, and with this title, she officially stepped onto the silver screen in 1920, signing a five-year contract with MGM for one hundred dollars a week. Thus, she went from small roles to supporting roles to lead roles, and eventually she was praised as the "First Lady of the Screen."</p>
<p>Wedding Ceremony</p>
<p>On Norma's third anniversary in Hollywood, Irving invited her to his home for dinner. This was the first sign of their affection. From then on, their feelings grew stronger day by day, and on September 29, 1928, they happily held their wedding. On September 14, 1936, Irving passed away from pneumonia, and her family happiness was declared bankrupt. In 1938, she made a comeback.</p>
<p>New Romance</p>
<p>Later, she started a new romance. Her neighbor, Franchot Tone Jr., was very close to her for a while. After Franchot Tone Jr. went to London, she had to pursue James Stewart. Now Stewart is pursuing Olivia de Havilland, and Franchot Tone Jr. has also gotten married. Disappointed, Norma became intensely involved with George Raft. Norma's recent situation is very leisurely and contented. Besides being with George Raft, she spends most of her time with her children. She has a ten-year-old son named Irving Thalberg Jr. and a five-year-old daughter named Kathleen. She is full of maternal love, teaching them Latin in her spare time and using various methods to make them happy.</p>
<h3 id="e104">An Analysis of Today's Shanghai Film Industry - The So-Called "Two Major Camps" and Others <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Haixing</p>
<p>When discussing today's Chinese film industry, it is said that it can be divided into two major camps. One is led by Zhang Shankun, including the three studios of Xinhua, Huaxin, and Huacheng, as well as distribution directors Wu Bangfan, Bian Yuying, and Li Dashen, Shen Quan'yin of Lianmei, Yan Hewu of Meicheng, and Yihua, which can also be included in this camp. Today, most directors and actors are recruited by Zhang's Guolian, so Lianmei and others must cooperate with Zhang in their production or distribution for the sake of convenience. As for the Nanyue Company, which is about to move to Shanghai, it will also be difficult to escape this pattern. If not, at least there will be major problems with manpower. The other camp, on the surface, seems to be Guohua and Jinxing, but in reality, the relationship between these two companies is only that they produce in the same location and some staff and actors can be used in common. The most important aspect of the quality of their products—their production policy—can be said to be completely different. From the Jinxing authorities' repeated discussions, it is known that they will open up new paths, and there will be no possible conflicts with Guolian and others in the future—such as the double-package case. Jinxing and Minhua are quite similar, as they both have their own ambitions. Minhua's attitude can be explained by director Fei Mu's way of dealing with the world: not saying much, working hard, and leaving the judgment of right and wrong to the world. As for Hezong, which specializes in filming "The Embroidered Scholar," it has a different attitude. It is relatively financially well-off, as if it doesn't care. Judging from the fact that the owner of Hezong, Wu Xingzai, has been supporting Ying Yin for a long time without rushing to talk about work, the reporter's words may not be too exaggerated.</p>
<p>In short, the so-called two major camps are actually just the Guolian system and Guohua. In terms of manpower and resources, Guohua is difficult to compete with the former, but the Liu brothers of Guohua are also capable people and have a strong desire to compete. As for Minhua, Hezong, and Jinxing, they do not have the same ambition and cannot be included in any camp.</p>
<p>There is progress after competition, but the way of competition must advance in both quality and quantity, otherwise it will inevitably go astray, which is not a blessing for the film industry.</p>

<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Five - Bad News</p>
<p>Hawthorn's answers on the phone were enough to make me nervous, but at this time there was another kind of unexpected tension that gave this case a dramatic development. When Hawthorn was on the phone, his eyes were always glancing out through the glass of the phone booth. I was standing at the entrance of the phone booth, facing Hawthorn, with my back to the entrance and exit of the hotel. I suddenly saw Hawthorn's eyes flash, followed by him raising his left hand like lightning, pointing behind me. Seeing his tense state, I didn't have time to ask questions, and quickly turned my head and saw the back of a man in a suit, hurrying towards the elevator. In this split second, I started running blindly after him. The man was five or six steps away from me. As he reached the elevator door, the two milky white painted steel doors were about to close. He tilted his body to the side, inserted himself in, and the steel doors closed. When I ran to the door, the elevator had already slowly started to rise! I hurriedly knocked on the steel door with my fist, looked up, and the indicator needle had just left "1" and suddenly stopped and went back, and the steel door reopened for me to enter.</p>
<p>When I stepped into the elevator, I secretly breathed a sigh of relief, my heart still pounding. But I had to pretend to be calm on the outside. I thought to myself that Hawthorn's tense signal must have been of great importance. He must have seen someone but didn't have time to follow, so he suddenly urged me to do it for him. So, who did he see? Could it be Zhao Boxiong? (72)</p>
