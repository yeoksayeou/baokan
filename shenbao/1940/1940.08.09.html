<h3 id="c7">四强公約與九國公約 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>昨日路透社華盛頓電稱：美國名政論家佛蘭克林氏論太平洋事，謂日本欲在形式上取悅德國，而在事實上則保持其行動自由；是誠鞭辟入裏之談哉。佛氏又謂美國在一九二一年四强公約下，有保護英法荷在太平洋領土主權之權；依照國際法之現行原則與美國家利益，美國可無須宣戰而實行此權云；亦見其所見之冷靜而深刻。值此英德戰爭相持不下，勝負未分之時：太平洋波濤汹湧，風雲險惡之日；尤如法屬越南備受壓迫，方傳法人擬集中駐遠東艦隊，並動員法越防軍，抗禦外侮之際；美國朝野誠能及時發揮基督入世之精神，警覺獨善其身之迷夢。爲國際道義，爲人類文明，亦即爲太平洋締造亘久之太平，爲美國保持遠大之福利，推動輿情，張揚正氣，劍及屨及，有作有爲，則能裨補世局，短縮戰禍，蓋有必然也。</p>
<p>上述佛蘭克林氏所論，將喚起美國朝野注意至如何程度，固未可知，然必爲世界大部人士所贊許。其間如所謂四强公約下之美國權利，尤願美國朝野多加注意。吾人深信美國朝野原未忘懷於四强公約。遠如一九三二年之史汀生氏主張制止遠東侵略，又如一九三八年底之對日正式通牒，皆以九國公約爲根據；九國公約者，與四强公約姊妹行也。近如美國迫於國際情勢，不得不建設舉世無匹之海軍，並決定設防關島；此與九國公約曁四强公約、亦有密切關聯者也。如此刺激，安得忘懷？回憶十九年前，承世界大戰之後，世界達者僉以減縮軍備，保障和平爲務；中美英法日義荷比葡九國會議於華盛頓，議決四要案；（一）規定三國海軍比率為美五英五日三。時，美日兩國間別有相互之諒解；而美國今日之增建海軍與設防關島，皆日本背　諒解之後果云。（二）簽訂英美法日四強公約，規定四國互相尊重各國所領屬之太平洋領屬，若受侵略，則共謀最有效之處置。佛蘭克林氏之議論，即以此爲根據。（三）簽訂九國公約，相約尊重中國主權領土與行政之完整，並維持門戶開放，機會均等。（四）解決中日間之山東問題，由中國向日本收回青島，並贖回膠濟鐡路。議成，世論　然，世局小康，此一九二一，二年間事也。其時，蘇聯在共產建國之中途，德國受戰後條件之束縛，皆平預國際事。</p>
<p>及今回憶，有不勝感慨者乎！防患莫善於患之未然，制亂莫善於亂之初萌，比失時宜，徒滋後悔；然而鑄錯未成，猶非不可挽救，要在急起直追而已。原國家根據所簽訂之條約而作何主張，出何行動，在一面爲正當之權利發動，一面爲神聖之義務觀念，二者皆不可輕忽。美國對於九國公約與四强公約，旣有其不容諉卸之義務，亦有其不可侵犯之權利。察之實際，迄現在爲止，美國於其義務，僅未否認，於其權利，僅未放棄；未嘗因義務利所在，翟然積極以赴；而所謂「不承認主義」者，即介乎其間之產物也。夫以「不承認」表示條約之存在，表示義務權利之存在，此自國際這若干觀點之，當然別饒意義，別有價值；以視蔑約背信者，所勝不可以道里計。若期「不承認主義」之本身，發生何種實效，則不能無疑。例如遠東事：在侵略之下，根據九國公約，美國之不承認與中國之持久抗戰，相得益彰；然試假想之，美國默認現實而中國繼續抗戰則如何？美國不承認現實而中國停止抗戰則如何？兩相比較，便得懷疑於不承認主義之實效。更如根據四國公約，萬一英法荷諸國之太平洋領屬竟被侵略而淪亡，美國則僅臨之以所謂不承認，爲問此亦即公約所謂有效之處置乎？中國而覆滅，太平洋英法荷領屬而淪亡，此所威脅於美國之安全者如何？威脅於太平洋之太平者如何？如此威脅，豈不承認所得與之作有效之抗衡乎？於是言之，美國之不承認主義者，雖爲美國賢明當局，阨於褊狹之孤立謬論，始苦心孤詣以倡導而運用之；然以美國與太平洋之實際利害而論，僅此不承認則仍無異於孤立；以國際條約之權利義務而論，僅此不承認則仍不能作爲了事也。美國國策强毅，顧輒遲遲其行；乃俟之半途或事後之挽救，雖非無及，然事倍而功半；防患制亂髯若奮爲之於今日哉！</p>

<p>倫敦　不管部閣員格林武昨在下院發動經濟組織之討論、謂經濟爲戰爭之命脈、現政府成立以來、卽致力於戰爭命脈之加强、當現政府成立之初期、英國顯然荷艱鉅擔負、惟今日氣象並不使人惶駭、欲求迅速制勝軍隊必須獲充分之配備、而人民必須具充分之信念、飛機坦克車槍砲彈藥皆需各種不同之技能及取自世界四方之各種村料、自飛機航程大增後、戰爭區域愈爲擴大、故戰爭已成爲</p>
<p>全面戰爭</p>
<p>所謂非戰爭之名詞、今亦不復有何意義、此種廣大而複雜之戰爭牽涉整個人民者、不可不有空前未開之大規模經濟結構、渠承認目前尙未臻此、以言敵方經濟、希特勒在其最近演說中、曾自矜其經濟力量、並謂共陸軍與空軍之供應品今較進攻西方以前儲備更多、此說或屬不謬、如英國之情形然、但希氏現已爲其新疆界內之嚴重問題所煩擾、而此難題將逐日加甚、希氏自稱、戰爭一日不了、食物供給不致一日中斷、此說也殊可爲疑、恐戰爭愈久則希氏愈增煩惱、蓋侵略與戰爭行動，已使其所奪土地化膏腴而成荒蕪矣、難民逃避、農事荒廢、戰車所經、田禾盡毀、加以德國農收今年亦不見佳、故在明春希氏將較目前更感覺</p>

<p>直到天明，一切都很順利。此後便接連兩天，嘗着轟炸的眞正滋味。敵機拚命向我們轟炸。由淸早一直到黃昏，轟炸機每隔數分鐘，便來更番肆虐，他們成羣而來，然後列成一直錢，領隊機轉了身，便直飛下來。你能聽到尖銳的引擎聲，逐漸强烈，然後轟的一聲，好像炸彈就投在身旁爆裂。這種可怕的爆炸聲，使你胸口喘哮，頭顱覺得要爆裂。不久我們就分辨得出炸彈聲音了，曉得呼嘯聲表示落彈地方尙遠，撕裂聲表示炸彈近在咫尺。在這種塲所，我覺得想想弟兄們，在崗位間走動走動，很多幫助。所以你要是怕的話，還是找點事情做做的好。在第一天敵　集中向戰壕轟炸的時候，眞覺得非常可怕。</p>
<p>一次，我蹲伏在戰壕裏，頭頂上受炸彈震動，泥屑碎片如雨而下。我忽然想起總司令所說的一句話，他說，戰爭是由連續着幾天的無聊，和突然間的緊張，交織而成。我陡然覺得這眞是至理名言，便不覺嘆哧的笑了出來。直到回頭看見一個弟兄正對着我在發怔呢。</p>
<p>在這樣情狀之下，等待了半天，仍舊見不到敵軍，便再向右移動，沿運河堤岸挖壕溝，經過兩座炸毀的橋樑。其時德軍在「英里之外，隱蔽在一倘小丘後面，上面架着迫擊砲，正在開放。但並不前進，僅由飛機繼續轟炸，炸彈漸漸的迫近了。我們掩蔽很好，死傷還是比較的少。</p>
<p>在那里駐守了三天，敵人已越過我軍兩翼，我軍便急忙的移動。從夜間十點半行軍，到翌晨四時三十分，纔由運輸車把我們一直開向亞蒙提亞。該城已遭受了嚴重轟炸。我軍運輸車穿城而過。可惜有一半車輛走錯了路，誤向加塞爾山開去。他們馳進了村莊，給橋上德軍的砲位大肆轟擊，這一下就損折了不少。這種情形，都是那些殘餘的隊伍，最後在鄧扣克與我們會師後，扌知道的。</p>
<p>概有半營兵直向斯騰伏進發，將近那裏的時候，便遭遇最密集的轟炸。午後天空昏黑，已被無數敵機遮蔽了。弟兄們正要跑向田間躱避時。炸彈飛來，正擊中前面一輛戰重車，裏　所有的人，不是死便是傷。我聞聲上前去看；見車中一個曹長身受重創，斷臂已經飛到路旁。當我行近時，他連聲喊道，「離開我，離開我！他一團裏幾個士兵冒着機關槍的火網和炸彈，上前把他界到路旁，就在一僩彈窟裏，經過一二分鐘的時間，把他的創口草草包紮。</p>
<p>直到天黑，轟炸機方始飛去。於是我們便走進一座村莊。停歇不久，奉命在午夜率隊守又路。在黑暗中架起戰車防禦砲，挖掘壕溝。長官對我說，我軍現在要保衛這條大路，掩護主力部隊撤退到鄧扣克。撤退部隊所走的路在我們左面，我們要竭力遏阻從右面進攻的敵人，使他們不能截斷撤退的部隊。</p>
<p>我們在路口直守到天亮。德國飛機又來不斷的轟炸，我實在疲乏不堪，有一二次竟倚砲磕睡。其時有迷途小犬一頭，蜷伏臂下，不時用冷鼻擦掠手腕，使我　醒。這些狗跟着我們一路撤退而來，總有二十來條。夜間，便和我們一同睡在穀倉。其中有雜種小犬一頭，有辨別轟炸機與其他飛機的能力，我們因呼之爲「空襲警報」。</p>
<p>黎明前，我軍又奉令會同法軍精銳担任右翼後衛。德軍幾次總攻，都被擊退。最後白刃衝擊，與德軍肉搏，殲敵數千。我見德軍在我電左面衝擊，好像後面有人迫着似的。他們雖則成羣的被機關槍掃射倒地，但仍是澈夜的前來衝擊。敵軍在白刃戰時並不中用，他們所怕的就是這一着。</p>
<p>我軍又奉命退却二英里，離鄧扣克祇有七英里了。一面沿波格斯運河堤岸掘壕，一面破壞水閘，我軍　面頓成澤國，確是天然的防禦工事。我軍左面是公路，數萬主力部隊都從那條路湧到海灘。我們附近的法國兵，都是好男子，也正在築壕。未幾，我砲隊也密密陣陣，一批一批的通過了我們所防守的關口了。</p>
<p>剛下戰壕，戰鬥便又發作了。最先是絡續不斷的德國轟炸機，繼之便是我軍的砲火。這兩天情况最爲惡劣，我軍死傷甚衆。第二天，德軍忽在戰壕前森林中出現，我軍便以機關槍火網迎擊，敵軍無法進展。我軍重砲，亦在後方對準敵人陣地連　轟擊，嗤嗤的砲彈都從頭頂飛掠而過。德軍數度進攻均未得逞，他們的損失一定很大。這這眞是一個火窟，並證明我軍火力實較敵人爲强。</p>
<p>入夜，川流不息大兵　　經走完，我便奉命向鄧扣克　退。時德軍砲火射程已達公路，我們只得在離公路三英里處暫時歇息。此去到鄧扣克六英里，我們竟走了十二小時之久</p>
<p>鄧扣克已經變成一個廢墟，到處都是火焰。軍隊數萬正在海灘待船。靠右面是個一英里長的碼頭，已經炸得不像樣子。我團數千人在黑暗之中，摸索着向那里魚貫跑去。要是天色一亮，德機又來轟炸，那倒不是玩的。我們一路前進，大家很安靜，很守秩序。不疲倦的人則扶持着他人行走。</p>
<p>走到海灘，見有驅逐艦兩艘停着。在漫漫黑夜中，海軍人負很鎭定的很迅速的把我們扶上艦，只費了半小時的工夫，就把一艘驅逐艦全都裝滿了。這時候天正破曉，我們已駛出港口，望見沿岸村鎭城市，一片火光，直到加萊爲止。內地天空，也被砲火反映得通紅。這是我回返英國之前，最後一霎間的見聞，以後我便昏昏入睡了。我雖曾聽到警鐘和」準備作戰」的口令，可是我全都不管了。</p>
<p>回顧這二十一天之中，最奇怪的，是我們的隊伍從未與德軍交綏一次。現在我眞躍躍欲試。再過幾天，我們一切都　恢　，預備重上前綫去矣…</p>

<p>— 編者</p>
<p>在三天之內，我們接到沂四十封學徒們寄來的信。內中有半數以上，看來似乎祗有讀過一二年的書（也是說明在鄕下私塾裏唸過時），其他也不會高過高小程度的；但是，同樣的，他們的求知欲非常迫切。</p>
<p>我們很高興作　們寫來許多關於學徒的文章，更高興這問題引起學徒本身的注意，不過，爲了篇幅關係，來信不能一一披露。</p>
<p>同時，曹靈佑先生也寄來一封信：讀到了八月五日「關於學徒的幸福」和「讀學徒的幸福後」一篇文章，我很感謝史偉先生與丁人先生，對我拙作「學徒的幸福」作善意的批評指正。不過我在這裏不能不再說幾句話，我作「學徒的幸福」一文，完全是因爲看到一篇談述學徒的文章，在那文章說及學徒大都是消沉的，自私自利的，於是我就好意的作了「學徒的幸福」，來勉勵一般爲學徒的人，叫他們知所奮發，知所努力。</p>
<p>我不獨爲着自己的文章，得到人家的批評，獲得進步而欣幸。我更爲着成千成萬的學徒而欣幸，因爲這問題已引起了廣泛的注意。</p>
<p>現在我們想暫時把這問題結束了，因爲在丁人，史偉兩君的文章中，對於改善學徒生活，及如何謀學徒眞正的幸福，已經作了很有力的籲請了。雖然，我們還是歡迎由理論而實踐的發現。</p>
<h3 id="c83">老閘橋畔 <a href="#c83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— 鞠鞠</p>
<p>這種事情也許不是罕見的。因爲我數年來朝晚出入。幾乎天天有這種事映進眼簾。常常走過北京路老閘橋一帶的行人，當然很多，那未他們的感覺或許比我更深刻。</p>
<p>這一帶所發生的事情，就是—偷竊，搶刧。假定是早晨吧。你瞧：買菜的主婦，女僕，包飯作司務，接踵並肩地擁進和擠出這喧嚷的菜塲。他們的籃子中，有的放置着魚肉，蔬菜，有的鷄子，鹹鮝等。菜塲內人聲鼎沸，塲外擾雜紊繁，於是買菜的人，不論進和出，很難提防到偷竊的一羣。</p>
<p>那邊人羣裏的三個幼年的癟三竊竊的咬了一會耳朶，另一個便躡手躡脚地溜上前去。前面走着一個中年婦人，她的籃子中，放着不步使他愜意的菜肴。他跟了不多幾步，突然地一仲手，一塊肉沒有聲音地到他的手中了。說時遲，那時快，他一個轉身，面上微微有一絲慌張，不管對方追來，或還未發覺，他早飛奔逸去了。</p>
<p>旁邊的行人會意地笑了，目送着那靈活的偷兒從人羣中失蹤。而前面呢，那提着失去肉的籃子的婦人，還不自覺地慢慢走着，行人又嗤的笑了。這批老的少的，還有女偷兒，循環不息地在那邊徘徊。單獨或合作做着這樣的工作。他們的飢饉竟也從這工作維持生命呢。</p>
<p>菜市落了幾點鐘後，這裏又開始蠕動了。大卡車獨輪車，也有菜販子肩挑着的蔬菜，肉魚類，蜂擁而來，這又給你瞧，他們勾當的機會了。</p>
<p>個壯年長髮的偷兒緊追着一輛大卡車，他毫不氣餒地跑過幾百碼，終於卡車因前面有障礙而煞車了。立刻像運動員在最後一分鐘的勁勢中，有力地向堆積着的目的物拚命一拉，得了，馬上脚底加油，一溜烟地跑了。</p>
<p>一輛黃包車在蝟集中的菜販叢停了下來，坐着的鄕下菜販，把後面懸掛着的菜部解下來，發覺部口拆毀了，菜少去三分之一。</p>
<p>老頭和老婦菜販，是他們的最好的對像。他們有時攫到靑白大菜，茭，白藕等，也有棉花，瓜果鐵條等，作爲他們的勝利品。他們抱着有什麼拿什麼的宗旨，不顧汽車在馳驅，不畏卡軍上的棒竿在揮擊，不理菜販在辱罵，一年，四季他們照樣幹着，生活着。</p>
<p>這種事情委實太平凡了，然而我每次看見的時候，終得希望牠不致像現在一般的普遍，最低限度的希望，是把道平凡的事情變作「罕見」。</p>
<h3 id="c84">小三子與王老爺 <a href="#c84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— 余羽</p>
<p>小三子沒有親人，也沒有家，住在我們的弄堂口已經快三個月了。</p>
<p>孤零的一個人，每天早晨和夜晚必到報館口門去等報紙，拿到了報紙才又回到弄裏來，向各住戶分報。這樣，就持了他的生活。</p>
<p>弄裏的往戶，一等到了有殘羹冷飯，必定說”「送給彝堂口小三子去吃。人們是那樣地記得小三子，爲的是小三子沒有一些野孩氣。</p>
<p>可是小三子終於要給王老爺　掉了。王老爺是我們邨裏的大房東，他自己也住在本邨，平日進出是很闊綽的，有保鏢也有汽車，可是不知爲了什麼，近來王老爺忽然把保鏢和汽車夫都解僱，步行進出了。（有許多人說他實行了新生活，可是也有人說王老爺近來的「生意」虧了本。）</p>
<p>爲了王老爺的下車步行，小三子就倒了霉。因爲那天，王老爺從投機市塲喘着氣走進弄堂裏來的時候，他瞧見了弄口的小三子的破蓆與鐵罐藏着許多臭東西，他就向管門的巡捕咆哮起來：</p>
<p>「他媽的，你究竟在管什麼？這種臭東西怎麼癟三拿了進來？」</p>
<p>氣勢很兇的，巡捕低着頭唯唯地應着。</p>
<p>我的弄堂裏不許有癟三進來！你看這些齪齷不齷齪？下次再這樣，就請你自己滾蛋！」</p>
<p>小三子呶着嘴，不敢說一句話，只拖着破蓆等物向弄外走出。王老爺將着八字鬚，兇狠狠地盯了巡捕一眼，又開起方步走進去了。</p>
<p>第二天，小三子依然拿着一疊報向各家分發，但分完了報以後又迅速地溜出了弄堂。弄堂外的人們問他昨夜住在什麼地方，他說住在一所洋房的水門汀道上。</p>
<p>有人說：主老爺往常因爲汽車出進，沒有注意到弄口的癟三小三子，現在用自己的脚來跑路了，就目光銳利起來，其實王老爺在汽車里的時候，也不會不見得這齷齪的小癟三，不過那時候他的神經管不到這些瑣事。</p>
<p>所以小三子的被逐，看來是小三子的不幸，共實更不幸的還是王老爺。</p>

<p>第五章　惡消息</p>
<p>霍桑因着電梯的遲遲上升，在那鋼門邊的電鈴上捺了一捺，就回身走到窗口邊去。我見他的臉色沉着，眉峯也緊蹙着，眼睛膫望着窗外密密排列的高低不一的屋頂，伸手到袋裏去摸出他的紙烟盒來。</p>
<p>我把肘骨靠着窗檻，乘機問道：霍桑，我看那個來這裏住過兩夜的女朋友，分朋就是王麗蘭。是嗎？」</p>
<p>霍桑仍瞧着那些浸在陽光裏的屋頂，點點頭道：那當然沒有疑問——不過有一點我眞不懂。</p>
<p>我急忙問道：那一點？——竟値得你這樣縐眉苦思？」</p>
<p>霍桑緩緩答道：「王麗蘭爲什麼到這裏來過夜？」</p>
<p>我不禁失聲笑道：這也用得着你費心思猜度？他們自然有他們的交情—不，說得乾脆些，這原算不得交情，分明是爲着一種單純而無恥的肉慾。」</p>
<p>霍桑把夾着紙烟的手搖一搖。一不是這個，你誤會了。你想伊爲什麼不留趙伯雄住在伊自己的家裏？那姓陸的寃桶旣然很放任女姓余的又能公然在伊家裏過夜，爲什麼伊對於這姓趙的偏偏移樽就教？</p>
<p>我想了一想，當然想不出合理的答案，便含糊地說：「那也許是一種另眼相看的特別交情。」</p>
<p>這解答當然不能使霍桑滿意。他吐吸着烟，默然不答。這時電梯上升到第七層，鋼門開了，放出兩個男客。霍桑向他們瞅了一眼，仍回頭瞧到窗口外面。電梯又繼續上升。</p>
<p>我又說道：那趙伯雄昨夜冒雨回來，是在一點鐘光景，時間上他已和兇案發生了密切的關係。回來以後，他又匆匆地搬塲。你可承認他的嫌疑比較最重？」（七〇）</p>

<p>月之四日，黃金日塲毛世來演文章會及刺巴杰雙齣。驅車往觀，抵院，掛印封金已上塲。小三麻子之紅生，在南方與林樹森均屬俊佼，二人藝事，各有所長，林擅唱而工架則略遜於小三麻子。惜是劇盪馬跑圓塲皆付闕如，僅在來塲，辭曹時，有幾個身段，亮相，然已覺美觀絕倫矣。程少餘係武二花之本工，今由其飾曹操，直婢學夫人，不敢逼視也。繼爲王仲臣之白水灘，該劇爲短打武生之累工戲，目今以蓋叫天爲最。是日自罵堂起，第四塲十一郎上，扮相尙英俊，白口當不能與北來之楊派武生高盛麟吳彥衡輩相比擬，舞棍踢帶俱見功夫。與靑面虎對打一塲，應火熾緊湊，而不涉案亂爲上乘。是日打來，未見精彩。接上陳少霖之賣馬，該劇票友均視爲畏途，蓋秦瓊雙手，馬蹄袖翻起，無水袖可遮蓋，故覺雙手之無處放置，而感侷促不安也。店主東一段，歌來宜幽抑，富有韻味爲佳。當時秦瓊正病困之際，不可引頸高歌，致不符劇情。少霖是段唱來尙無疵，惟氣口不勻，高時尙可，低時幾不能聞。文章會爲　玩笑劇，塲子過於散漫鬆弛，相公書僮之共患相思病一塲，可博一笑，毛世來之萍兒，僅有吹腔「月影花陰照紗窗」一段，嗓音淸亮，確較上次來滬時進步多多，故此番能動全部玉堂春及四郎探母諸劇也。壓軸爲刺巴杰，世來之馬金定，武工的是不弱，連擊鐵門坎兩個，走邊葉子均乾凈俐落，惟有時似太隨便。陳少霖之前部駱宏勛，店房中二簧搖板至「坐在招商店，珠淚滾滾，」四句，歌來響退行雲，痛快淋漓，爲是日聽歌之最士收穫。扮相亦較帶鬚爲佳。後部駱宏助爲王仲臣，僅一塲開打。艾世菊之胡理，正對其工，走矮步，刀跳鐵門坎等矯捷之極，武丑中之雋才也。袁世海之鮑賜安，戲不多，未能展其所長。</p>

<p>生活擅刊卓氏照片　判決採取折衷辦法</p>
<p>滑稽宗匠卓別麟的第六部出品，片名「大獨裁者」，攝製經年，世人望眼欲穿，現在消息傳來，這部行將哄動世界的影片，準備不日問世了。</p>
<p>卓別麟本人對此片嚴守秘密，可是好久以前，已有消息透露，原來「大獨裁者」內容，是卓別麟一人兼飾被拘在集中營的犯人和他的元首，因爲面貌酷似，且蓄着小鬍子，不知怎麼一來，這個犯人竟和元首辨認不淸，原先是犯人竟做起元苜，眞正的元首却被拘入集中營。</p>
<p>世人對於「大獨裁者」故事的輸廓，大槪已有印象，不過從沒有見到卓別麟飾元首希特勒的照片，未免引以爲憾，直到上月份，美國「生活」Life）圖畫週報的編輯人用盡千方百計，才覔到卓別麟飾希特勒的珍貴照片，這照片上的卓別麟身穿制服，高冠巍峨，帽上的國徽是兩個斜十字形。「生活」週報的編者一方寫信通知卓別麟，一方把照片刊出，却不料鬧出大事。</p>
<p>原來卓別麟攝影塲收到這信兩天後便向法院起訴那「生活」週報，理由是刊登這照片，一經公布，則「大獨裁者」原可穩獲的五百萬元利潤或將因而大减，所以要求賠償損失一百萬元。</p>
<p>「生活」週報也請律師辯護，說這幀照片，目下爲世人所關心，所以刋出，卓別麟接信後，立卽關照停止刋出，則無問題，却不料竟向法院起訴，結果，雙方商得折衷辦法，由法院下令禁刊卓別麟飾獨裁者的照片，業已印好發出，刋有這照片的「生活」週報　百八十多萬册，無法收回，尙未印出的一百十餘萬冊，便把這照片除掉，改用汽車大王福特參觀陸軍驅逐機的照片，一塲訴案，才算了結。</p>

<p>關於拍攝有聲電影的聲音，有許多都是僞造的，譬如將兩手持了一塊薄鉛皮猛揮，便能生雷聲。汽車的馬達聲，常是用一種特製的口笛發出的。將許多籐條抽擊覆鬃的布上，可發出排槍的聲音。把豆子投進一個很多彎曲的管子，可發出海浪聲，最近還有人發明一種用電駕駛的機器，能發出許多種不同的偽造聲，巧妙得更不可言喻！</p>
<p>（八）業餘攝片拍攝電影所需的材料，都很昂貴。一架開麥拉的代價，決非普通人的經濟力量所能辦到。並且攝影的附件又多　又笨重，不易携帶。爲了適應普通人業餘攝片，市上有專爲業餘家特製的開麥拉機出售。這種開麥拉機，較正常製片公司用的開麥拉簡單得多。價格也便宜不少，容積極小，很便携帶。用片分兩種：第一種所用片的大小和普通製片公司所用片完全一樣。第　種所用片却較略小，這種業餘開麥拉，不及普通開麥拉最大之點，就是攝成的片長極爲有限。有的長　十公尺，有長四十，六十，等，最長不過一百公尺。所以放映的時間，祇能極短。不過能自己動手攝片，自己放映，這已足够有趣的事了！</p>
<p>電影雖已至很發達的地步，但前途卻還未可限量；試看立體式電影已在萌芽，恐怕再隔一二年偃能和大衆見面了。據目前的略的統計說，全球的電影院共有六萬家以上，觀衆數千萬，並且電影現巳被公認爲推廣文化，大衆娛樂的最大工作。見了如此盛况，想當初終日躱在實騐室研究發明電影的祖師爺們，如安迪生，茂別萊其，百拉脫，盧米埃氏弟兄等，當能含笑九泉了！（完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">British Somaliland: Garrison at Zeila Retreats Automatically; Italian Forces Attack Berbera in Three Routes; British Planes Attack Bardera Port in Libya <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>London: Responsible authorities here have recently confirmed that the garrison at Zeila in British Somaliland, under the command of Brigadier General Chater, has retreated automatically without resistance. This is because the defense forces there originally adopted a joint defense system with the French Somaliland garrison. Now that the French have ceased hostilities, the British forces in the port considered themselves too weak. After consideration, British military authorities decided to retreat to the line between Berbera and Bulhar, in order to extend the Italian forces' supply lines as much as possible and lure them into a quagmire. (Havas dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>Cairo: A British Air Force communiqué stated that there was aerial activity on all fronts yesterday. British planes conducted multiple valuable reconnaissance missions. Ships and warehouses in the Libyan border port of Bardera were attacked by British aircraft, and a large building was destroyed. The communiqué also stated that during reconnaissance in the Tobruk area on August 6th, a British airship was shot down. One crew member died, and three others were injured and captured. In Italian North Africa, British bombers attacked the submarine base of Massawa on August 7th and 8th, directly hitting one warship and one submarine. All British planes returned safely. Italian fighter planes flew over Malta yesterday but retreated before British fighters could intercept them. (Reuters dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>Rome: The Italian military headquarters announced this afternoon that after crossing the border of British Somaliland three days ago, our forces have now advanced to the coastal area and occupied the port of Zeila. In East Africa, our planes bombed the Wajir airfield, destroying three enemy aircraft and shooting down another in aerial combat. The losses suffered by the enemy in the bombing of Diredawa, Massawa, and others were minor. An English convoy in the Eastern Mediterranean, consisting of five freighters protected by warships, had two ships destroyed by our planes. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>Beirut: According to broadcast news received here, Italian forces occupied the port of Zeila in British Somaliland yesterday. Zeila is the largest port in British Somaliland besides Berbera. Before the outbreak of the Italian-Abyssinian War, Britain suggested ceding Zeila to Italy to avoid war. (Haitong dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>Nairobi: A communiqué stated that two enemy planes bombed Wajir unsuccessfully on Tuesday. British fighters pursued them, and one of the two Italian planes was hit, but both escaped into the clouds. The official announced the second list of casualties in the East African military campaign, including fifteen non-British personnel and two British army corporals who died. (Reuters dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>Cairo: It was formally announced here yesterday that the armistice conditions regarding the fate of French Somaliland are currently under discussion, but the details are unknown. (United Press dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>Beirut: According to Aden Radio, Italian forces are attacking Berbera, the capital and largest seaport of British Somaliland, in three routes. One part has reached halfway between the border and Berbera. The British army's counterattack by motorized units has been repelled. (Haitong dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>Cairo: A communiqué recorded the Italian invasion of British Somaliland, stating that after the British forces withdrew from Zeila on August 5th, one route of Italian forces entered. On the same day, a large Italian force with tanks, artillery, machine guns, and planes occupied Hargeisa. The British side concealed that the Italian forces suffered heavy casualties and three Italian tanks were destroyed before they retreated. British casualties were minimal. At 8:00 AM on August 6th, enemy infantry used artillery and tanks to occupy Odweina, which was harassed by a small mechanized unit of the Somaliland Camel Corps. The British side suffered no losses. Regarding the Palestine front, enemy planes attacked Haifa again on the morning of August 6th, dropping some bombs, most of which fell into the sea or barren land, causing no damage. No bombs hit the city of Haifa, and no soldiers were injured. Civilian deaths and injuries were less than ten. Anti-aircraft artillery</p>

Regarding the Somaliland war, a responsible person in London stated last night that Britain proposed to cede Zeila to Italy in 1935, but it was declined. The area was not fortified. Italian forces now want to advance along the coast to Berbera, which is 150 miles away. British forces will begin resistance in the mountainous area outside Hargeisa and Odweina. (Reuters dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>Cairo: Highly mechanized Italian forces are attacking Berbera, the coastal capital of British Somaliland, in three routes. Although the British forces put up strong resistance, they ultimately lost three important towns on the road yesterday due to the intense Italian offensive. (Allied dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>Haifa Port Attacked Again</p>
<p>Rome: Although the Italian Air Force's attack on the port of Haifa encountered fierce anti-aircraft fire, it still achieved great success. Italian pilots stated that the newly installed British anti-aircraft guns were numerous. A Stefani correspondent reported that the Italian planes dropped several tons of bombs, hitting warehouses and port facilities. The large fire caused by incendiary bombs soared into the sky. Haifa was also heavily damaged in the previous two air raids. Many oil tanks of the Iraq Petroleum Company were set on fire. The destruction of the Haifa oil refinery is a heavy blow to the British military, as the British Air Force in the Eastern Mediterranean relies on the refinery for supplies. (Haitong dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>British Forces from the Near East Head to Egypt</p>
<p>Athens: According to news received from Jerusalem here yesterday, a large number of British troops from the Near East, mostly motorized and mechanized units, boarded ships in Haifa yesterday to go to Egypt to reinforce the troops there. This is because some British troops have been transferred to Aden and Zeila. British authorities have been recruiting volunteers in Palestine, and thousands of Jews are expected to be enlisted. (Haitong dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>Observations from The Times</p>
<p>London: The Times stated that Italy's forceful actions in North Africa were long anticipated. After long preparations, Italy chose an appropriate time to join the war. It is surprising that the war in Africa was delayed for so long. The Italian forces in East Africa are holding back on the Sudanese border, apparently because of the rainy season. The Italian forces did not immediately attack British Somaliland because they wanted to wait for the Vichy government to replace the governor-general of French East Africa. The original governor-general was ambitious. If he were still in office, the activities of the French forces in Djibouti would be a concern. The Times mentioned the threat to Egypt, saying it is expected that the British army will not rely on border defenses to resist the Italian advance. Given the small number and strong combat power of the British army and the local terrain, the British army seems to be actively utilizing the desert, relying on mobile warfare and raids to win, and not defending against the enemy at any designated location. The momentum of the Italian offensive there should not be underestimated, but the British commanders in the Middle East and Egypt have complete confidence in the test of strength. The preliminary victory gained by the Italian army will only bring trouble to itself, not blessings. (Reuters dispatch of the 8th)</p>

<p>London: The British mail ship "Anchorite" (9,377 tons) has sunk off the west coast of Ireland. Over 450 survivors have landed at a port in northwest England, and 19 people are missing, including 11 passengers and 8 crew members. According to the Admiralty, there were no children on board. It has been determined that the ship was torpedoed on July 26th when an enemy submarine attacked the convoy and sank within half an hour. According to Captain Smith, passengers were having dinner when the torpedo exploded, and they boarded lifeboats in an orderly manner. Most of the fatalities were due to a motorboat capsizing and drowning or being killed by the torpedo explosion. Furthermore, a waiter on the ship had encountered torpedoes four times. It is reported that the ship shook from the torpedo hitting in the middle, but no submarine was seen. However, it is known that at least one submarine was sunk hours later.

<p>Rio de Janeiro: Yesterday evening, residents of the north coast of Rio de Janeiro heard the sound of heavy artillery in the sea, as a new clash was underway between the British armed merchant ship "Alcantara" and a German ship. Many believe that this German ship is the one that sank the British ships "King John" and "Twickenham." When these two ships first clashed on July 31st, this German ship was hit by shells from the British ship "Alcantara" and was forced to use heavy smoke to escape. Although the hull of the "Alcantara" was scarred by shells from the German ship, it quickly pursued until the German ship disappeared, and then stopped. This battle occurred just outside the neutral zone, which the American republics warned belligerents to avoid in the Pan-American Conference. The "Alcantara" docked at the Vienna shipyard here on August 2nd for repairs and will be able to go to sea in a few days. (International dispatch of the 8th)</p>

<h3 id="e7">The Four-Power Treaty and the Nine-Power Treaty <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a Reuters dispatch from Washington stated that the famous American political commentator Mr. Franklin commented on Pacific affairs, saying: "Japan wants to please Germany in form, but in fact, it retains its freedom of action." This is indeed a penetrating remark. Mr. Franklin also said that under the 1921 Four-Power Treaty, the United States has the right to protect the sovereignty of British, French, and Dutch territories in the Pacific. According to the current principles of international law and the national interests of the United States, the United States can exercise this right without declaring war. This also shows that his views are both calm and profound. At this time, when the British-German war is in a stalemate and the outcome is undecided, and the Pacific is turbulent and dangerous, just as French Vietnam is under severe pressure and it is reported that the French plan to concentrate their Far East fleet and mobilize the French-Vietnamese defense forces to resist foreign aggression, it is hoped that the American government and people can promptly promote the spirit of Christian engagement in the world, be alert to the illusion of self-interest, and for international justice and human civilization, that is, to create lasting peace in the Pacific and maintain long-term welfare for the United States, promote public opinion, promote justice, act promptly, and be proactive, so that the situation can be improved and the war can be shortened. This is inevitable.</p>
<p>It is not yet known to what extent the above-mentioned Mr. Franklin's remarks will arouse the attention of the American government and the public, but they will certainly be approved by most people in the world. Among them, the so-called rights of the United States under the Four-Power Treaty are particularly worthy of the attention of the American government and the public. We firmly believe that the American government and the public have not forgotten the Four-Power Treaty. As far back as 1932, Mr. Stimson advocated stopping aggression in the Far East, and as recently as the formal ultimatum to Japan at the end of 1938, all were based on the Nine-Power Treaty. The Nine-Power Treaty is a sister treaty to the Four-Power Treaty. Recently, the United States has been forced by the international situation to build an unparalleled navy and decided to fortify Guam. This is also closely related to the Nine-Power Treaty and the Four-Power Treaty. With such stimulation, how can it be forgotten? Looking back nineteen years ago, after World War I, world leaders all took reducing armaments and guaranteeing peace as their mission. China, the United States, Britain, France, Japan, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Portugal held a nine-nation conference in Washington and resolved four key issues: (1) The naval ratio of the three countries was set at 5:5:3 for the United States, Britain, and Japan. At that time, there was a separate understanding between the United States and Japan; and today's increased naval construction and fortification of Guam by the United States are the consequences of Japan reneging on that understanding. (2) The Four-Power Treaty was signed by Britain, the United States, France, and Japan, stipulating that the four countries should respect each other's Pacific possessions, and if attacked, they would jointly seek the most effective measures. Mr. Franklin's argument is based on this. (3) The Nine-Power Treaty was signed, agreeing to respect the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and administrative integrity of China, and to maintain the open door and equal opportunity. (4) The Shandong issue between China and Japan was resolved. China recovered Qingdao from Japan and redeemed the Jiaoji Railway. After the agreement was reached, the world was pleased, and the situation was stable. This was in 1921 and 1922. At that time, the Soviet Union was in the middle of communist nation-building, and Germany was bound by post-war conditions. Neither actively participated in international affairs.</p>
<p>Looking back now, can one not feel a sense of deep emotion! Preventing trouble is better than dealing with it after it has happened, and stopping chaos is better than waiting for it to escalate. Missing the opportunity only increases regret. However, if the mistake has not yet been made, it is not too late to remedy it. The key is to catch up quickly. When a country makes a claim or takes action based on a treaty it has signed, it is both exercising a legitimate right and fulfilling a sacred obligation. Neither should be neglected. The United States has both an inescapable obligation and an inviolable right regarding the Nine-Power Treaty and the Four-Power Treaty. In reality, so far, the United States has only not denied its obligations and only not abandoned its rights. It has not actively pursued its obligations and rights. The so-called "non-recognition doctrine" is a product that falls in between. Using "non-recognition" to indicate the existence of a treaty and the existence of obligations and rights naturally has special significance and value from a certain international perspective. It is far superior to those who violate treaties and break faith. However, it is doubtful whether the "non-recognition doctrine" itself will have any practical effect. For example, regarding the Far East situation: Under aggression, the United States' non-recognition and China's sustained resistance complement each other under the Nine-Power Treaty. But suppose the United States tacitly accepted reality and China continued to resist, or the United States did not recognize reality and China stopped resisting? Comparing the two, one would doubt the practical effect of the non-recognition doctrine. Furthermore, under the Four-Power Treaty, if the Pacific possessions of Britain, France, and the Netherlands were actually invaded and fell, would the United States only apply the so-called non-recognition? Is this the so-called effective measure in the treaty? If China is overthrown, and the Pacific possessions of Britain, France, and the Netherlands fall, what would be the threat to the security of the United States? What would be the threat to the peace of the Pacific? Can this threat be effectively countered by non-recognition? Therefore, although the United States' non-recognition doctrine was painstakingly advocated and implemented by the wise authorities of the United States, bound by narrow isolationist fallacies, in terms of the actual interests of the United States and the Pacific, this non-recognition is still tantamount to isolation; and in terms of the rights and obligations of international treaties, this non-recognition still cannot resolve the matter. American national policy is strong and resolute, but it is often slow to act. Rescuing it halfway or afterwards, although not entirely too late, is more difficult and less effective. Preventing trouble and stopping chaos should be done today!</p>

<p>Chongqing: The Chinese here are paying close attention to the Italian offensive in Somaliland and Egypt, believing that this may be a prelude to a joint offensive by the Axis powers against Britain. It is said that once the Italian offensive begins, Germany will attack Britain, and Japan will invade French Vietnam in the Far East in order to attack China and Singapore. People here also believe that during the recent visit of the Japanese delegation to Berlin and Rome, the military operations of the three countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan against the British Empire have generally reached an understanding. Although Japan has denied this, Chinese people here say that they have received information indicating that Japan is now demanding the following two things: (1) establishing naval, land, and air force bases in Vietnam; (2) allowing troops to pass through Vietnam to fight against China, with Kunming as the objective. Chinese people here claim that once Japan establishes complete control over Vietnam, it will not be difficult for its troops to pass through, and it can even achieve the purpose of attacking Singapore from land, with Saigon as a base. The occupation of Singapore will give Japan complete control over the South Pacific, placing the Dutch East Indies and British and French Borneo under its control, and leaving Japanese troops only 350 miles from Australia. On the other hand, some people doubt whether Japan is willing to risk such a large-scale operation. They believe that Japan may temporarily be satisfied with occupying French Vietnam as a base for attacking Kunming, while adopting a wait-and-see policy towards the international situation. In short, the Chinese here all expect very important developments in the Far East and Europe in the near future. (Reuters dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: When a Japanese Navy Ministry spokesman met with reporters today, he stated that although Britain had signed an agreement promising not to allow military supplies to reach Chongqing via Burma, Britain had not fulfilled its promise.

Japan can only hope that the news agency's report is inaccurate. (United Press dispatch of the 8th)</p>

<p>Tokyo: A spokesman for the Japanese Navy Ministry recently stated that Japanese authorities have received information that although Britain has agreed to block the Burma Road for three months, the transportation of military supplies on that road is still continuing. If this information is true, then it can be seen that Britain has not faithfully fulfilled its promise. The spokesman also cited news from Chongqing, saying that although other transportation has stopped, medicines and chemicals are still entering Yunnan from Burma. The spokesman believes that chemicals should be included in the list of military supplies. (United Press dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to Japanese sources, a spokesman for the Navy Ministry told reporters today that he had learned that the Burma Road is still transporting war supplies to the Chongqing government. If this statement is true, then Britain is currently not faithfully complying with its promises. He hopes that this statement is not true, but it must be investigated. According to the Chongqing Ministry of Communications, medicines and chemicals are currently being transported between Burma and Yunnan, while other items have been suspended. It should be noted that chemicals are also on the list of war supplies. (Reuters dispatch of the 8th)</p>

<p>Washington. The United States has taken active measures against Japan. Government officials implemented an embargo on Japan yesterday. At the same time, wartime raw material ships were specially permitted to sail to the Soviet Union. The US Naval Committee has strictly rejected two requests from US ships to transport steel and kerosene to Japan. However, two US oil tankers fully loaded with gasoline were specially permitted to sail to Vladivostok, Soviet Union. (International News Service dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Washington. The United States has not yet responded after accepting Japan's protests against the oil and iron embargo. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>San Francisco. According to an authoritative petroleum expert who announced yesterday that the main raw material for the Japanese navy and army is oil. In the six months before President Roosevelt announced the ban on the export of aviation gasoline, the amount of oil ordered by Japan in California indicated that Japan had no intention of promoting a territorial expansion policy. In fact, California is Japan's most important source of oil. Since this year, Japan's purchases have been decreasing. Officials also said that two years ago, Japan purchased a large amount of oil from California to meet the needs of the navy and army in the Far East. The country's purpose was to obtain six months' supply, and its purchases were still based on this principle. Although Japan has stored a large amount of oil, because its oil is entirely purchased from California, the authorities have accurate statistics on the amount of purchases. Therefore, the petroleum industry here is closely monitoring this trend. In fact, they believe that Japan's oil purchases are an accurate measure of Japan's deliberate intentions, which can be used to predict the uses of oil by the navy and army in its future expansion plans. They argued that if Japan intends to launch an attack in the Far East, then Japan should have stored a large amount of oil in advance, and at the same time prevent the possibility of a US embargo. At present, Japan has not only failed to make such plans, but its purchasing power has also sharply decreased since the first year. The recent restrictions on the use of oil in the country further indicate the severity of its oil situation and the impossibility of making further attacks. However, they acknowledged that Japan, due to the lack of oil, may launch a military invasion of Malaya and the Dutch East Indies. According to California oil statistics, in 1939, when Japan wanted to achieve the goal of accumulating six months of oil reserves, except for January, Japan purchased 2 million barrels of oil from California every month, increasing to 2.9 million barrels in April and 2,513,000 barrels in November. In January 1940, since Japan purchased 2,415,000 barrels of oil, the number of oil purchases gradually declined. In March and May, Japan purchased 1.8 million barrels of oil. As for the other months, Japan purchased more than 1.4 million barrels of oil per month. Pacific coast officials stated that Japan cannot produce oil domestically, and 10% of the country's oil needs must be purchased from California. Pacific coast officials felt that Japan could not attempt any serious territorial expansion movement. They acknowledged that the US embargo on oil exports is the best weapon for the United States to stop anything that would harm US interests in the Far East. (United Press dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>Moscow. The seventh session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union concluded successfully last night amidst thunderous cheers. The following important resolutions were passed in seven days: (1) Report on the government's foreign policy; (2) Incorporation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina into the Soviet Union; (3) Incorporation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union; (4) Incorporation of Estonia into the Soviet Union; (5) Incorporation of Latvia into the Soviet Union; (6) Approval of orders issued by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union since the previous session.</p>
<p>Guo Xinan Appointed as Vice Chairman of the Council</p>
<p>Yesterday was the last meeting of the session. The two chambers held separate meetings. The Federation Council meeting was convened at 2:00 PM to discuss the approval of orders issued by the Supreme Soviet since the previous session. Andreyev, Chairman of the Federation Council, introduced Ge Jin, Secretary of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, to speak. Under Mr. Ge's motion, the Federation Council unanimously passed the bill on amending Articles 13, 23, and 48 of the Soviet Constitution. The amendment of these constitutional clauses was prompted by the establishment of the Moldavian Federal Republic and the incorporation of the three Baltic states. The new clauses stipulate the election of sixteen Vice Chairmen of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (according to the total number of Soviet republics, the Soviet Union has sixteen republics, in other words, each republic elects one vice chairman). At this point, the Karelian-Finnish Federal Assembly and the Elders Committee of the two chambers moved to elect Guo Xinan as the Vice Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. The Federation Council immediately passed it, and the whole venue welcomed it.</p>
<p>The Federation Council Approves a Batch of Appointment Orders</p>
<p>Subsequently, the Federation Council accepted the request of Prosecutor Panlayev to relieve him of his post and, under the motion of the Elders Committee of the two chambers, appointed Bachkov as the Prosecutor of the Soviet Union. At this point, the Federation Council unanimously approved the orders issued by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet on the establishment of the All-Union New People's Committee, the People's Committee of the Electrical Industry, and the People's Committee of the Fiber and Paper Industry. In addition, the council also approved the orders of the Presidium regarding the following appointment letters: (1) Voroshilov, in the capacity of marshal, was appointed as the Deputy Chairman of the Soviet People's Committee and Chairman of the National Defense Committee of the committee; (2) Malyshev, Popovkin, and Gusikin were appointed as Deputy Chairmen of the People's Committee; (3) Timoshenko was appointed as the Chairman of the National Defense People's Committee. The other approved appointment letters are as follows: Chairman of the Oil Industry Committee Sidin, Chairman of the Electrical Plant Industry Committee Laidekov, Chairman of the Electrical Industry Committee Bogatilov, Chairman of the Steel Industry Committee Tivasyan, Chairman of the Metallurgical Industry Committee Ramko, Chairman of the Shipbuilding Industry Committee Nosenko, Chairman of the Heavy Machinery Committee Yefimov, Chairman of the Fiber and Paper Industry Committee Chibatarev, Chairman of the Fisheries Committee Eskov, Chairman of the Textile Industry Committee Akimov, Chairman of the Timber Committee Sukiyev, Chairman of the Soviet National Bank Sukolov. In view of the fact that Timoshenko had been appointed as the Chairman of the National Defense Committee, the Federation Council decided to remove him from his post as a member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. The Federation Council also approved orders regarding the awarding of honors to senior generals of the Red Army and Navy, the establishment of an eight-hour day, seven-day week work system, the strict prohibition of employees from leaving their posts without permission, and poor production. At this point, the chairman announced that the seventh session had come to an end. (TASS dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>Washington. The US State Department is still observing developments in the Far East with great attention and is paying close attention to the Anglo-Japanese dispute. The arrests of Japanese residents by the British have had a calming effect in Tokyo. People here do not find this unusual and believe that the result of this move by the British further proves the general belief here that Japan wants to see the results of its political intimidation but does not want to take serious international action. Franklin, one of Washington's most famous political commentators, revealed a piece of information in the *Washington Post* yesterday that, if his statement is true, it can be seen how Japan's relationship with the Axis powers is progressing. He stated that General Ott, the German Ambassador to Japan, visited Konoe twice before his inauguration, requesting that Oshima, the former ambassador to Germany, who advocated close contact with Germany and Italy, be appointed Foreign Minister and that moderate elements in the cabinet be eliminated, with the Axis powers' assistance to Japan in obtaining control of the Dutch East Indies as an exchange condition. Whether there are moderate elements in the current Konoe cabinet remains to be proven, but at least the request for Oshima to become Foreign Minister has been rejected. According to Franklin's opinion, Japan wants to formally please Germany while in fact maintaining its freedom of action. The German ambassador already had this request when Japan was not yet fully bound by the Axis powers. It can be seen how much freedom and independence Japan can have in the future if Britain fails and Germany establishes a new world order. Mr. Franklin also stated that the United States has the right to protect the sovereignty of the British, French, and Dutch territories in the Pacific under the Four-Power Treaty of 1921. The United States can exercise this right without declaring war in accordance with the current principles of international law and US national interests. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>

<h3 id="e30">British House of Commons Discusses Economic Organization Issues; Minister Without Portfolio Greenwood Presents Report; Labor MP Shinwell Expresses Views <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>London - Minister Without Portfolio Greenwood initiated a discussion on economic organization in the House of Commons yesterday, stating that the economy is the lifeblood of war. Since the current government was established, it has been dedicated to strengthening the sinews of war. When the current government was first established, Britain clearly bore a heavy burden, but today's situation does not cause alarm. To achieve a swift victory, the military must receive full equipment, and the people must have full confidence. Aircraft, tanks, guns, ammunition all require different skills and various materials from all parts of the world. Since the range of aircraft has greatly increased, the war zone has expanded, so the war has become a</p>
<p>Total War</p>
<p>The so-called non-war term no longer has any meaning. This vast and complex war, involving the entire population, must have an unprecedented, large-scale economic structure. He admitted that this has not yet been achieved. Speaking of the enemy's economy, Hitler, in his recent speech, boasted of his economic strength, saying that the supply of supplies for his army and air force is now greater than before the attack on the West. This may not be wrong, as is the case in Britain, but Hitler is now troubled by serious problems within his new borders, and this difficulty will increase day by day. Hitler claims that food supply will not be interrupted for a single day until the war is over. This is also doubtful. The longer the war lasts, the more trouble Hitler will have, because aggression and war actions have turned fertile land into wasteland. Refugees flee, farming is abandoned, and fields are destroyed wherever tanks pass. In addition, Germany's agricultural harvest this year is not good, so next spring Hitler will feel more</p>
<p>Food Problems</p>
<p>The difficulty. Hitler will continue to manufacture war equipment, but his main industrial areas and aircraft fields have suffered heavy damage. Oil refineries, warehouses, railways, docks, and ships have now become the targets of British aircraft bombing day and night. In the future, the stronger the British bomber force, the more severe the enemy will be hit, so its production capacity has undoubtedly been greatly hindered. The damage to production facilities and transportation lines is difficult, if not impossible, to repair in a short time. Hitler must take supplies from storage to deal with everything. The fiercer the fighting, the more the stored items are consumed, and the more difficult it will be to replenish the losses. Britain has already tried to prevent Hitler from obtaining foreign assistance. Not only Germany, but also the areas under its control cannot communicate with the outside world. The blockade is extensive, and with trade routes cut off, the enemy will be even more embarrassed. Hitler will inevitably continue to seize food and raw materials from the occupied territories, but this supply will also be exhausted. Hitler boasts of having a lot of iron, which is inexhaustible. The enemy does have a lot of iron, and may not worry about the lack of aluminum supply, but its overseas situation is very different. In terms of supply, there must be a large shortage. Even if Hitler has mountains of iron, without good coal for smelting iron, the iron will ultimately have no highest military value. In peacetime, Britain annually exports 30 million tons of coal to Europe, but now not a ton falls into German hands. Hitler's land consumes 20 million tons of oil annually, but now Hitler can only hope to obtain half of it. Hitler is encountering such economic situations, which sooner or later</p>
<p>Will Worsen</p>
<p>At that time, the oppressed people of Germany and other places will wish that we could or could not endure this suffering, which is undoubtedly true. However, Britain should not underestimate its current power. Germany is single-mindedly focused on one thing, that is, preparing the strongest and most terrifying combat power the world has ever seen. The German economic system has been based on war for the past few years. The British must know that they have not yet felt the heavy blow of Hitler. The British have proven that they can be remarkably effective in war, no less than dictatorship, but the British are still in the process of transforming from a peaceful economy to a war economy. The British must make good use of their resources to support national life and national spirit and win the war. For the sake of victory, the British government will use all human, industrial, financial, and all foreign assets, so it must formulate an economic strategy in order to achieve the practical results of cooperation in all aspects, Greenwood said, and then elaborated on the various economic problems to be considered and</p>
<p>Adjust the Economy</p>
<p>A new approach to efforts is that each issue is now handled by a subcommittee composed of members of the War Cabinet and relevant ministers. One of the most important elements in the efficiency of economic warfare is the disposal of surplus overseas goods, so that they benefit Britain and do not benefit the enemy. After the collapse of France, production problems became more difficult. Britain gave priority to manufacturing the war equipment necessary to resist the enemy, while preparing for the possibility of a long-term war. It is now continuing to consider how to fully utilize raw materials, factories, and labor to carry out the production process, Greenwood continued</p>
<p>Industrial Capacity</p>
<p>The details of the organization, and said that measures have been taken to prevent air raids that destroy factories, and also said that since the dissolution of the British-French Joint Purchasing Commission in the United States, a new agency has been established to handle purchasing matters in the United States. This agency has been actively working for several weeks. The United States is now arming the entire country and mobilizing its industry. Months ago, Britain placed orders with American industry to make up for the shortage of Allied production. Now, it must embark on a larger program related to American national defense, so the complexity of the work of the British Purchasing Commission in the United States is self-evident. At the same time, Britain must adjust the needs of Britain, the autonomous territories, India, and the Allied countries that rely on British assistance in London and New York. Now the United States and Canada have become the most important suppliers of British war equipment. For the sake of effectively carrying out the war, people's consumption should be guaranteed and unnecessary hardships should be avoided. The rise in the cost of living is not as severe as the rise in prices. The government's goal is to curb prices, and this policy should maintain the health of the people. The government has tried to increase exports, but in the current environment, the possibility of increasing exports is not satisfactory. As for British shipping, it is still not bad. Britain should store food and raw materials to the best of its ability to prepare for emergencies. It is impossible for the enemy to starve the British to death. Unnecessary imports should be banned, and the rate of domestic aircraft and military equipment production has recently increased greatly, and there will soon be great progress. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>London - After Greenwood spoke in the House of Commons yesterday, Labor MP Shinwell proposed that a very detailed investigation should be conducted into the economic possibilities of the country, and asked whether the government had assumed that the war would be extended for two or three years and estimated the needs of aircraft, ammunition, labor, raw materials, and exports. Is there a real allocation between true war necessities, exports, and civilian necessities? Shinwell also said that according to reliable estimates, Germany has 780,000 men and women receiving industrial training, while Britain has only 28,000 people who have already received industrial training, and 40,000 who can receive training this year. Rather than allowing British miners to be unemployed, would it be better to subsidize mine owners, continue working, accumulate more coal, or move miners into war industries? In order to develop export trade, manufacturers and export companies should be subsidized. All individual efforts and competitive behaviors must be replaced by a perfect system of cooperative production. Britain must rely on itself and not rely too much on the United States, because the United States may go to war with Japan. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<p>London - The "elastic springboard" prepared by the Germans in Europe to launch a blitzkrieg against the British Isles, after being heavily bombed by the British for days, the Germans launched an air raid on the entire British Isles yesterday in retaliation. Since Tuesday evening of this week, the activity of German aircraft has been greatly reduced compared to before. Unexpectedly, yesterday several detachments of German aircraft suddenly appeared over the northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest regions of the British Isles, breaking the silent air. The British anti-aircraft defense team naturally made a lot of noise. The British Air Force also flew across the Channel yesterday, without stopping all day.

<p>London - An Air Ministry communiqué stated that on Tuesday night, British Air Force bombers had to abandon many planned bombing targets due to low cloud cover and poor visibility. However, the British aircraft still braved these difficulties and bombed oil refineries in Hamburg, warehouses in Hillte, anti-aircraft artillery teams in Hanpon, and a factory in Morse. At the same time, aircraft fields in the Netherlands and northern Germany were also bombed by British aircraft, causing multiple fires. One British aircraft was missing. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

At that time, there were several German twin-engine giant aircraft at the airfield, and several other medium aircraft near the aircraft hangar. The British aircraft launched a surprise attack, dropping bombs on the aircraft and near the hangar, and then retreated into the clouds. Only then did the ground anti-aircraft artillery team open fire. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>London - Today, when German aircraft continued to attack British ships and cities, fierce air battles occurred over the English Channel. At least six German bombers and three fighters were shot down. Two British Air Force pilots were missing. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Berlin - This afternoon, the German military communiqué stated that a German submarine sank three enemy merchant ships, totaling more than 16,000 tons. Last night, German aircraft laid mines outside British commercial ports and attacked several arsenals, as well as the locations of anti-aircraft guns and searchlights, such as the industrial institutions in Plymouth, the anti-aircraft artillery teams and searchlight locations in Manchester, Cardiff, and Dolsthrough, all of which were bombed. Last night, enemy aircraft bombed western and northern Germany, but the German side suffered very little loss. Several private residences were destroyed near Aissen and Datoln. Fires initially broke out, but the fire brigade rescued quickly, preventing the fire from spreading. Two enemy aircraft were shot down. (Haitong Telegram, 8th)</p>

<h3 id="e33">German Military Department Announces Naval Achievements <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Berlin - The German military department announced today regarding the achievements of naval operations, stating that not long ago, a large batch of goods was intercepted by German ships and escorted to German seaports. Several days later, the official gazette stated again that several enemy ships had been sunk by German ships. Today, the official gazette stated again that 30,000 tons of enemy ships had been destroyed in a very distant sea. This achievement is worthy of attention, because German ships are operating in the ocean without a base of operations. If they go to neutral seaports to add fuel or food, they are also easily detected by the enemy, and all enemy merchant ships are equipped with weapons, so it is not easy to sink merchant ships. Although the German Air Force was less active yesterday, the Taikoo Aircraft Field on the east and west coasts of Britain, the Amstong Aircraft Manufacturing Plant in Chester, and the Xuansi Ordnance Factory were all attacked by the Air Force one after another.

<h3 id="e35">Central Daily News Publishes Editorial Warning Chinese People Not to Purchase Foreign Currencies; World is Unstable, All Foreign Currencies May be Devalued; Possibility of Decline in Value of Legal Tender Has Been Reduced <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing - The Central Daily News here recently published an editorial warning Chinese people not to purchase foreign currencies and deposit them in foreign banks, saying that when the war was limited to China and Japan, capital flight from China was unnecessary, but when the war spread to the world, any foreign currency could be in danger of stopping market transactions at any time, causing holders to be affected. In this unstable autumn of the world, exchange controls or any currency devaluation are not limited to defeated countries. Even in the victorious countries, fearing that any extraordinary rise or fall in currency will cause confusion in the economic system and trade, they may also take such measures. The richest country in the world, the United States, has devalued the gold dollar, and due to the current decline in the exchange rate between the US dollar and the British pound, there are rumors that the US dollar will continue to devalue. It is generally believed that the belief that currency deposited in foreign banks will remain in China forever is a mistake, because this currency must be moved to another country in order to avoid local control regulations and exchange rate increases. If a country to which the bank belongs participates in the war, the depositor will not be able to convert the deposited funds into legal tender or withdraw the funds from the bank. Some people also believe that storing foreign currency bonds is safer than opening a foreign currency account in a bank. This belief must be a mistake, because any foreign currency only circulates in the country of issue, and its value abroad only exists when there is an exchange rate. Once market trading stops, this currency will be worthless. During the last war, those who held rubles or marks outside of Germany and Russia suffered great losses, which can serve as a warning. Moreover, even in peacetime, the value of banknotes is often lower than the actual exchange rate, because interest, freight, and insurance costs must be deducted. Others think that storing gold bars is the best, which is also a mistake. Gold has now been nationalized. At present, the power of the Chinese authorities cannot temporarily reach Shanghai, so there is a black market. However, once the war ends, even if the Chinese government does not confiscate gold, it will definitely buy it at the official price. The article also lists the reasons for the current rise in the value of legal tender as follows: (1) The Japanese who previously purchased foreign exchange are now selling it, obviously wanting to obtain legal tender to purchase Chinese products for export; (2) Overseas Chinese are remitting funds back to the country due to fear of new local control regulations; (3) Banks of various belligerent countries are now selling foreign exchange to purchase legal tender to cope with possible withdrawals; (4) Imports to Shanghai are gradually decreasing, while exports are increasing. After settlement, foreign currencies will tend to be in oversupply; (5) As the confidence of the Chinese people has increased, the possibility of a decline in the value of legal tender is decreasing day by day. Once the war ends, holders of foreign currencies will inevitably be forced to settle at the official exchange rate. (Telegram, 8th)</p>

<p>Hong Kong - According to reliable sources, the Hong Kong authorities, in accordance with the recent British statement to Japan that the detention of British ships in Guangzhou was a violation of the 1939 Okazaki-Bland Agreement, have refused entry to Japanese ships. According to the provisions of the Okazaki-Bland Agreement, if Japan closes the Pearl River and does not allow British ships to navigate, then Britain will not provide Hong Kong to Japan for transportation. At present, the British ship Fo Shan has been detained by the Japanese in Guangzhou. The Japanese side has declared that unless the ship pays HK$4,000 as a harbor pilot fee, it will not be given an export permit. The owner of the Fo Shan is unwilling to pay this fee, because the British crew of the ship already have a harbor pilot license and do not need a Japanese harbor pilot. The British authorities reported that Japan's detention of British ships was an indication of the blockade of the Pearl River, so they also did not allow Japanese ships to enter Hong Kong. (United Press Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - The British authorities here have refused to allow two Japanese ships to enter Hong Kong. This incident occurred after the British had a dispute with the Japanese authorities in Guangzhou over the Taikoo Company's Fo Shan ship sailing between Hong Kong and Guangzhou, because the ship had been blocked in Guangzhou since last week. Currently, this dispute is being resolved by British Consul General in Guangzhou Bland and the Japanese authorities in Guangzhou. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<p>Until dawn, everything went smoothly. After that, for two consecutive days, we experienced the true taste of bombing. Enemy planes desperately bombed us. From early morning until dusk, bombers came in waves every few minutes to wreak havoc. They came in groups and then formed a straight line. The lead plane turned around and flew straight down. You could hear the sharp engine sound gradually intensifying, and then a loud bang, as if a bomb had exploded beside you. This terrible explosion made your chest wheeze and your head feel like it was about to burst. Soon we could distinguish the sounds of the bombs. A whistling sound meant the bomb was landing far away, while a tearing sound meant the bomb was very close. In this situation, I found that thinking about my brothers and walking around the positions helped a lot. So if you are afraid, it is better to find something to do. On the first day, when the enemy focused its bombing on the trenches, it was truly terrifying.</p>
<p>Once, I was crouching in a trench, and the vibration of the bomb overhead sent mud and debris raining down. I suddenly remembered a saying of the Commander-in-Chief, who said that war is woven from consecutive days of boredom and sudden tension. I suddenly felt that this was a profound truth, and I couldn't help but laugh. It wasn't until I turned around and saw a brother staring at me in a daze.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, after waiting for half a day and still not seeing the enemy, we moved further to the right and dug trenches along the canal bank, passing two destroyed bridges. At that time, the German army was "miles away, hidden behind a small hill, with mortars set up on top, and they were opening fire. But they did not advance, only continued to bomb with planes, and the bombs gradually approached. We were well concealed, and the casualties were still relatively few.</p>
<p>We were stationed there for three days, and the enemy had crossed the flanks of our army, so our army quickly moved. We marched from 10:30 at night until 4:30 the next morning, when transport vehicles drove us straight to Armentières. The city had been severely bombed. Our army's transport vehicles passed through the city. Unfortunately, half of the vehicles went the wrong way and mistakenly headed towards Mont Cassel. They drove into the village and were heavily bombarded by the German artillery positions on the bridge, resulting in significant losses. This situation was only known by those remaining troops after we reunited in Dunkirk.</p>
<p>About half a battalion of soldiers marched directly towards Steenvoorde, and as they approached, they encountered the most intense bombing. In the afternoon, the sky was dark and obscured by countless enemy planes. Just as the brothers were about to run into the fields to hide, a bomb struck the front of a heavy vehicle. Everyone inside was either dead or wounded. I went forward to see what had happened and saw a sergeant in the vehicle severely wounded, his severed arm lying on the side of the road. As I approached, he shouted repeatedly, "Leave me, leave me!" A few soldiers from his unit braved the machine-gun fire and bombs to drag him to the side of the road, and in a bomb crater, they hastily bandaged his wounds in a minute or two.</p>
<p>It wasn't until dark that the bombers flew away. Then we walked into a village. After resting briefly, we were ordered to lead a team to guard the road again at midnight. In the darkness, we set up anti-tank guns and dug trenches. The officer told me that our army was now going to defend this road, covering the main force's retreat to Dunkirk. The road taken by the retreating troops was to our left, and we had to do our best to contain the enemy attacking from the right, so that they could not cut off the retreating troops.</p>
<p>We guarded the road junction until dawn. German planes came to bomb constantly again, and I was really exhausted. I even dozed off against the gun once or twice. At that time, a lost puppy was curled up under my arm, occasionally wiping my wrist with its cold nose, waking me up. There were about twenty of these dogs that had followed us all the way in retreat. At night, they slept with us in the barn. One of them, a mongrel puppy, had the ability to distinguish between bombers and other planes, so we called it "Air Raid Siren."</p>
<p>Before dawn, our army was ordered to join the elite French forces to serve as the rearguard on the right flank. The German army's several general attacks were all repelled. Finally, we charged with bayonets, fought hand-to-hand with the German army, and annihilated thousands of them. I saw the German army attacking to the left of my position, as if someone was forcing them from behind. Although they were mowed down in groups by machine guns, they still kept coming to attack all night long. The enemy was useless in bayonet fighting; that was what they feared.</p>
<p>Our army was ordered to retreat two miles further, only seven miles from Dunkirk. While digging trenches along the banks of the Bergues Canal, we also destroyed the sluice gates, and our front immediately became a swamp, which was indeed a natural defensive fortification. To the left of our position was the highway, and tens of thousands of the main force poured onto the beach from that road. The French soldiers near us were all good men and were also building trenches. Before long, our artillery units also passed through the pass we were defending, densely packed, batch after batch.</p>
<p>As soon as we got down into the trenches, the battle broke out again. First, there were continuous waves of German bombers, followed by our army's artillery fire. These two days were the worst, and our army suffered heavy casualties. On the second day, the German army suddenly appeared in the forest in front of the trenches, and our army greeted them with a machine-gun fire net, preventing the enemy from advancing. Our heavy artillery also continuously bombarded the enemy's positions from the rear, and the shells whizzed over our heads. The German army's several attacks all failed, and their losses must have been great. This was truly a pit of fire and proved that our army's firepower was indeed stronger than the enemy's.</p>
<p>At night, the endless stream of troops had finished passing through, and I was ordered to retreat towards Dunkirk. At that time, the range of the German artillery fire had reached the highway, and we had to rest temporarily three miles away from the highway. From there to Dunkirk, six miles away, it took us twelve hours.</p>
<p>Dunkirk had become a ruin, with flames everywhere. Tens of thousands of troops were waiting for ships on the beach. To the right was a mile-long pier, which had been bombed beyond recognition. In the darkness, thousands of people from my regiment groped their way to it in single file. If it had been dawn and the German planes had come to bomb again, that would not have been a joke. We moved forward all the way, everyone was quiet and orderly. Those who were not tired helped others to walk.</p>
<p>When we reached the beach, we saw two destroyers docked. In the pitch black night, the naval personnel calmly and quickly helped us onto the ships. In just half an hour, they had completely filled one destroyer. At this time, dawn was breaking, and we had already sailed out of the harbor, seeing a sea of fire from the coastal villages and towns, all the way to Calais. The inland sky was also reflected red by the artillery fire. This was the last glimpse I had before returning to England, and then I fell asleep. Although I heard the alarm bells and the "prepare for battle" command, I didn't care at all.</p>
<p>Looking back on these twenty-one days, the strangest thing was that our troops never engaged the German army once. Now I am really eager to try. In a few days, we will all recover and prepare to go to the front line again...</p>

<h3 id="e38">Rampant Terrorist Crimes: Five Kidnappings Occurred Yesterday, with a Total of Seven Victims; Criminals All Hired Cars for Their Operations <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Recently, kidnapping cases in this city have emerged one after another. The police authorities of the two concessions attach great importance to them and spare no effort in investigating the criminal gangs. Despite the authorities' efforts in prevention and investigation, the trend of kidnapping has not abated slightly. Yesterday alone, as many as five kidnapping cases occurred in succession. The victims were three rice merchants, two silk merchants, a four-year-old child, and an unidentified man. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Two Rice Merchants Kidnapped Simultaneously</p>
<p>The first kidnapping case occurred at 6:30 AM yesterday. Prior to the incident, three criminals went to the Xiang Sheng Automobile Branch on Jiaozhou Road and Yuyuan Road and rented a car with license number 18404, driven by driver Xu Arong, to the Andong Hotel on Hubei Road. Upon arriving at the hotel, the criminals got out of the car one after another and went straight to Room 258 on the second floor of the hotel. At that time, a traveler named Huang Shengbai, a 30-year-old rice merchant from Jing, and his friend Shi Junde (some say his name is Zhu Zijun, 37 years old) were still fast asleep in the room. When the criminals entered the room, they immediately brandished pistols, threatening Huang and others not to make a sound. Under the criminals' threats, they were unable to resist and followed the criminals downstairs, got into the car, and the criminals forced the driver to drive to the Hongye Garden on Yuyuan Road. Then, they dragged Huang and Shi out of the car and abducted them. The driver reported to the police, and the Andong Hotel's accounting room also reported to the police. By the time the police arrived, the criminals had already fled far away. The police summoned the tea attendant on duty to the police station for questioning to assist in the investigation.</p>
<p>Child Kidnapped on Haifang Road</p>
<p>The second kidnapping occurred at 7:10 AM. At that time, the Yunfei Automobile Company on Jing'an Temple Road received a phone call stating that someone at 1075 Xiaoshadu Road wanted to hire a car. The company ordered driver Li Guanghua to drive car number 12285 to the location. When he arrived at 1075 Xiaoshadu Road, there were indeed two men and one woman waiting for the car. One of the men immediately drew a gun and drove the driver out of the car. Then, the criminals drove off themselves. It was later learned that the car drove to the intersection of Haifang Road, Jinghua Road, and Yanlingfang, and kidnapped a four-year-old boy into the car. At that time, the guard at the entrance of the lane saw the situation and tried to stop them. The criminals fired a shot as a warning, fortunately not injuring anyone. The criminals then drove away quickly. The kidnapped boy was the young son of Lu Jicheng, the owner of the Lu Xunji electroplating factory at 50 Jinghua Road, named Da Nv. He was being held by his nanny at the entrance of the lane yesterday morning when he was kidnapped. Later, the car was found in the area under the jurisdiction of the Gordon Road Police Station.</p>
<p>Unidentified Man Forced into Car</p>
<p>The third kidnapping occurred at 7:35 AM at the Yuyuan Road branch of the Tailai Automobile Company. A man went to hire a car, and the company sent driver Chen Fugen, a native of Yancheng, to drive car number 12079. After the man got into the car, he first drove to the Lvfang Food Company at 952 Jing'an Temple Road, had breakfast, got back into the car, and asked the driver to drive to the front of 956 Kaixuan Road, where he ordered the driver to stop. Two men then got into the car and ordered the driver to drive to the back door of 11 Lane 159, Yidingpan Road. The criminals ordered the driver to stop and drove the driver out of the car, with one criminal guarding him. The other two criminals then entered the house. After a while, a man with black glasses on his nose was forced into the car by the two criminals and driven away quickly. The driver was guarded for four hours before he regained his freedom and reported to the police. It is still unclear whether this case is a kidnapping or a relocation of a hostage. The police are conducting a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>Two Silk Merchants Abducted Together</p>
<p>At 7:45 AM yesterday morning, a kidnapping occurred at 470 Yuyuan Road, West Shanghai. The kidnapped victims were He Shenzhi and He Lunzhang, who resided in the lane. Both He were engaged in the silk business and lived at No. 9 in the lane. They had their own car, license number 1446, and hired a driver named Luo Zhixiang. At 7:45 AM yesterday morning, the two He, accompanied by their friend Deng, left in their own car. As the driver, Luo Zhixiang, was driving the car out of the lane entrance, three kidnappers suddenly stopped the car, each brandishing a pistol, threatening the driver and He not to make a sound. They first drove He's friend Deng out of the car, and then two criminals jumped into the car compartment, monitoring the two He. One criminal sat next to the driver, ordering him to drive eastward. Under the threat of a pistol, the driver dared not resist. The car drove to the vicinity of Fuxu Road and Weihaiwei Road, and the criminal monitoring the driver drove the driver, Luo Zhixiang, out of the car and drove off westward. After being driven out of the car, the driver reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station in charge. At the same time, his family had also been informed. After receiving the report, the police chief immediately ordered Chinese and Western detectives to go to the scene of the incident to investigate and telegraphed to all police stations for assistance in the search.</p>
<p>Another Rice Merchant Also Arrested</p>
<p>The fifth incident occurred at about 1:30 PM. Liu Litang, a native of Hangzhou, engaged in the rice business and had Room 4 at the Yuanyuan Shunji Hotel on Jiujiang Road for business negotiations. Liu had a friend, Han Xuewen, also a native of Hangzhou and also engaged in the rice business. Yesterday afternoon, at 1:30 PM, he went to the Yuanyuan Hotel to visit Liu. As soon as he arrived in the room and took off his long gown, three men suddenly appeared, one dressed in Chinese attire and two dressed in Western suits. The one dressed in Chinese attire was watching at the door of Room 4, and the two dressed in Western suits broke into the room, asking which one was Mr. Han Xuewen. Seeing that the two were well-dressed, Han did not suspect anything and replied that he was surnamed Han. Upon hearing this, the two men immediately brandished pistols, threatening him not to make a sound, and ordered Han Xuewen to leave with them. Because the two men were armed with pistols, Han dared not resist and had to go with them. As soon as he walked out of the Yuanyuan Hotel, he was forced into a Xiang Sheng car parked in front of the door and driven away quickly. Later, Liu Litang reported to the police station in charge and sent detectives to investigate. The police are still investigating the reason for the kidnapping.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Qiongzhou Ship Loaded with Goods, Sailed to Haiphong This Morning; Reports of Disruption of Outer Shanghai Defense Line Are Inaccurate <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Since the Japanese military threatened the Vietnamese authorities in early July, prohibiting military supplies from entering the mainland via Vietnam and stationed supervisors in Haiphong, Saigon, Hanoi, and other places in Vietnam, cargo transportation on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was immediately suspended. Shipping lines on the Shanghai and Haiphong defense lines were also suspended for a time, but resumed on the 8th. After the resumption of shipping lines, due to the disruption of cargo transportation on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, each ship sailing from Shanghai to Haiphong had no cargo to transport. It is now reported that the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway has resumed transportation of ordinary goods, except for military supplies. Therefore, the Qiongzhou ship of the Taikoo Company, which sailed to Haiphong this morning, had goods to transport. In the future, all goods except military supplies can be transported as usual. The rumor that the Shanghai-Haiphong line has been temporarily disrupted is absolutely inaccurate. Perhaps it is because the Taikoo and Jardine companies have no ships to dispatch in recent days that the outside world mistakenly believes that the shipping line has been disrupted.</p>

<p>The British Residents Association in China has seen a sudden increase in membership of 565 people in the past few weeks. According to reports, the total number of members has increased to 1,864. On the 6th of this month, the association convened a general meeting of members at the association's headquarters and elected Wilson as a director.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Special Alert Commenced This Morning; Defense Forces Awaiting Orders to Mobilize; All U.S. Marine Corps Remain in Camp; All Shanghai Volunteer Corps Armed and Return to Units <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The third anniversary of the "August 13th" Anti-Japanese War is approaching in an instant. The authorities of the two concessions in Shanghai have implemented special alerts since this morning. This special alert is even more severe than the previous two sessions. It has been implemented since this morning. All police officers in the two concessions' police stations have been mobilized. Special patrol officers in the Public Concession and French volunteers in the French Concession will also participate. At the same time, the defense forces of various countries stationed in Shanghai, such as the British Defense Force, the Seaforth Highlanders, the U.S. Navy's McClelland Detachment, and the defense forces of France and Italy, will be stationed in their original defense areas, assisting in the defense where strength is insufficient. Roads with unimportant traffic have been obstructed with obstacles since 1:00 AM this morning, cutting off traffic, as in the past. The Municipal Council's police authorities have also found that the barbed wire fences built in various roads and lanes are mostly rusted and unusable. To strengthen the defense within the concession, they have specially dispatched police officers carrying a large number of iron wires, adding them to the grid between the traffic intersections and unnecessary lane entrances and exits, strengthening the obstacle equipment.</p>
<p>All U.S. Marine Corps Remain in Camp</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the 4th Marine Regiment of the U.S. Navy stationed in Shanghai will remain in camp from 10:00 PM tonight (the 8th) to August 15th, and will not be allowed to leave, in order to cooperate with the Municipal Council's police department around the anniversary of the August 13th Shanghai War and maintain治安。 It is heard that U.S. Marine Corps patrols will still defend their jurisdiction, the same as previous anniversaries, to ensure peace and prevent disturbances in the area. It is heard that the guerrilla forces in the suburbs of Shanghai are becoming more active on anniversaries. Therefore, all military organizations in the concession will cooperate with the Municipal Council to densely deploy a security line around the area to ensure peace within the concession.</p>
<p>Volunteer Corps Return to Units; Japanese Military Exercises</p>
<p>In addition, the Shanghai Municipal Council Volunteer Corps has issued an order from the corps commander, H.P. Humphrey, yesterday, summoning all the corps' teams, including (1) the Cavalry, including the Light Cavalry and the American Cavalry, (2) the Regiment, including the Armored Car Team, the Machine Gun Team, and the Chinese Team, etc., (3) the A-Team Battalion, including the A Team, the B Team, the Scottish Team, the Jewish Team, and the Anti-Aircraft Team, (4) the B-Team Battalion, the American Team, the British Machine Gun, the Portuguese Team, and the Filipino Team. From 5:00 AM this morning, all troops will be armed and deployed. As for the white Russian troops, they will still patrol within the concession at that time, such as the Avenue Joffre east of Bubbling Well Road and the roads along the Huangpu River. The Japanese Marine Corps plans to conduct exercises starting at 10:30 AM on "August 13th". The exercise area will be from Yokohama Road via Bazih Bridge to Guangzhong Road, and a viewing platform will be set up on Guangzhong Road for Japanese residents to visit.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Water and Electricity Workers Strike One Step Closer <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, Yu Qiaqing and Xi Yushu, Chinese members of the Municipal Council, went to the Water and Electricity Company to meet with Chairman Cadbury to mediate the labor dispute between the company and its employees. According to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, the company originally insisted that workers who had been replaced by White Russians for strike action would not be allowed to return to work. Now the company no longer insists on this point. It is heard that Yu plans to visit the company again today for further negotiations.</p>
<h3 id="e43">White Russian Association Under Protection; New Leader to Take Office; Most White Russian Residents Do Not Express Approval; Thousands of People Attend Mesila's Funeral <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The Continental News reported that the White Russian Residents Committee in Shanghai has weakened due to the assassination of Chairman Mesila and will soon be absorbed by the "White Russian Immigrant Association" under the protection of the Japanese on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek. The important work of issuing passports, etc., will be taken over by the new association, headed by White Russian lawyer Ivanov.</p>
<p>Mesila Case Not Yet Clarified</p>
<p>As for who assassinated Mesila, the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department has not yet found out. A Russian-language newspaper in Shanghai that supports the Soviet Union claims that the murder was committed by those close to the new regime, while the Russian-language Far Eastern Times claims that Mesila was killed by communist elements.</p>
<p>New Chairman Faces Many Difficulties</p>
<p>The English-language China Press also reported that according to White Russian sources in Shanghai, Ivanov, who served as a judge in the Russian Consulate in Shanghai during the Imperial Russian era, will succeed Mesila as chairman of the White Russian Residents Committee on Saturday. Many White Russians in Shanghai are opposed to Ivanov's succession to this position, but they will not strongly object.</p>
<p>Bishop John Receives Threatening Letter</p>
<p>According to news this morning (the 8th), Bishop John, who temporarily took charge of the affairs of the White Russian Residents Committee after Mesila's assassination, received a threatening letter stating, "You have presided over three funerals, and you will preside over seventeen more funerals. However, the twenty-first funeral will be recited by others." Yesterday afternoon, Mesila's coffin was buried in the Jing'an Temple Cemetery. Thousands of White Russian men and women attended the funeral, many sobbing uncontrollably.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Salvation Army Is a Charitable Organization; Absolutely No Political Role; Newspaper Falsely Accuses It of Being a Spy Organization; Salvation Army Authorities Solemnly Deny It <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese-language Continental News published a cartoon in a prominent position, falsely accusing the British Salvation Army of being a purely spy organization. Regarding this matter, a British major of the Shanghai branch office of the Salvation Army solemnly denied it to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency. He said, "The Salvation Army is a purely charitable organization and treats people of all countries equally. Not only does it provide relief to British, French, and Chinese refugees, but it also strives to help people of German, Italian, and Japanese nationality who need relief, without any distinction. Since its establishment, the Salvation Army has a considerable history, and its non-political nature is well known. The Japanese newspaper's claims are unknown."</p>
<p>Maurice Talks About Relief Work</p>
<p>According to Maurice, the district director of the Shanghai district of the Salvation Army, the army has issued a total of 8,000 rice tickets since it started providing rice to the poor in April of this year, with each ticket issuing five sheng of rice, totaling 40,000 sheng. Anyone who is determined to be poor and unable to purchase rice can go to the Salvation Army's office to request the issuance of the rice ticket. There are four rice collection points, including Yisheng Gong on Kangti Road and Baotai Rice Shop in Hongkou. Since the army started providing assistance to refugees returning home last month, more than 100 refugees have been left behind, and the army has given each person a discretionary amount of repatriation fees, approximately 25 yuan per person.</p>
<p>Assisting the Poor with Small Businesses</p>
<p>He also said that the army is currently providing subsidies for small businesses to the poor. Any poor person who is properly introduced and has no funds to operate a small business can go to receive a subsidy, ranging from 10 yuan or more per person. The army will also establish two shelters in the concession in October, one for orphans and one for widows, and will also establish a special school for refugee children. Finally, he said that the army's monthly operating expenses in Shanghai are approximately 8,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Since Qian Hongye, the chief judge of the criminal court of the Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Local Court, was killed in his residence on the 29th of last month, the Chinese people in Shanghai have mourned in unison.

<h3 id="e46">Shot Police Officer Dies of Injuries <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>On Saturday of last week, a gentleman residing on Huanlong Road was attacked by two thugs in front of his residence, but the attempt failed. At that time, police officer Li Liuru of the French Concession No. 1057, who was nearby, arrived at the scene after hearing the alarm and was shot in the back by the thugs. He was sent to Guangci Hospital, but his treatment was ineffective, and he died in the hospital last night (the 7th) due to his injuries. It is heard that the officer was selected for service last year and has not yet completed one year. He died in the line of duty, leaving behind an elderly mother, a weak wife, and a son who is still in diapers. In addition to holding a funeral on a regular basis, the police department has also requested the upper authorities to grant generous compensation to comfort his soul.</p>
<h3 id="e47">The Japanese Fleet Again Shells Zhenhai, Yidao is Bombed, Zhenhai Refugees Desperately Await Relief, Resumption of Shanghai-Ningbo Route Shows No Progress <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>According to reliable information from shipping circles in this city, the Japanese fleet outside Zhenhai fired six shells towards Jiangnan yesterday afternoon. The attack was fierce, but the shells landed in the mud, causing no damage. Since the Chinese army completely recovered Zhenhai on the morning of the 22nd of last month, local order has been restored. All government offices have returned to work, transportation has been fully restored, and the Zhenhai branch of the Zhejiang Local Bank has also resumed business. The market is gradually returning to normal. However, small ferries between Ningbo and Zhenhai have not resumed operations because the newly built Meilu dike blocks the river without leaving a gap. The damage from the war is severe both inside and outside the city. Although the shops along the main street are intact, everything inside and outside the West Gate has been reduced to ashes. More than 4,000 houses have been burned down, and residents are displaced, a truly tragic sight. Currently, all sectors of Zhenhai have established a refugee shelter at the Lanpu Temple outside the West Gate, and many soup kitchens have been set up inside the city to provide relief. Because the port of Zhenhai is under surveillance and blockade by the Japanese fleet, resumption of navigation is unlikely in the short term. Given that sailing vessels approaching the Zhenhai blockade are frequently shelled indiscriminately by the Japanese fleet, it seems unlikely that normal traffic between Shanghai and Ningbo can be restored in the short term.</p>
<p>Yidao Bombed with Four Bombs</p>
<p>A telegram from the Ningbo community in Shanghai reports that at 6:48 AM yesterday (the 7th), the sound of engines was heard in the Lingshan area of Yuyao. Three Japanese planes were then spotted over Baiguan, Shaoxing, Zhuji, and after passing over Yidao in Jinhua, they dropped four bombs on the southeastern outskirts of Yidao. After dropping the bombs, the planes returned along the same route.</p>
<p>Investigation of Bombings in Yongjia and Yuyao</p>
<p>Reports concerning the renewed bombing of Yongjia and Yuyao have also been received as follows: On the 6th, Yongjia, the leading county of Wenzhou, and Yuyao, an important town on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, were bombed by Japanese planes. An investigation revealed that Japanese planes dropped two bombs on Yongjia and two bombs on Yuyao. One bomb landed near the Jiwei Bridge outside the Houqing Gate. At that time, the market was thriving and ships were setting sail, resulting in two sailing boats being sunk. The Jiwei Bridge was also slightly damaged, and teahouses, taverns, and shops near the bridgehead were destroyed. In this incident, two people were seriously injured and died immediately, and four others were lightly injured and sent to Huijing Hospital for emergency treatment. Another bomb landed outside the Xishui Gate, but did not injure anyone, and no other damage was sustained.</p>

<p>A visitor from Suzhou reported that Chinese mobile troops have recently been very active in the suburbs of Suzhou. On the 28th of last month, the Provincial Security Corps, led by Yang Zhong, ambushed a vehicle of the "Central China Automobile Co., Ltd." in Weijingtang in the northern suburbs, capturing Weng Xuan, an important "official" of the pseudo "Suzhewan Consolidated Tax Bureau of the Suxiangchang District," and a lawyer registered with the pseudo "court." The company commander detained them.</p>
<p>The other dozens of passengers were escorted to the vicinity of the highway to facilitate their return by car. Commander Yang also gave a generous speech to the passengers, explaining the reasons for the inevitable victory in the war of resistance. Furthermore, at the end of last month, the unit attacked the pseudo "police station" in Qimen, Suzhou, and Lumu Town, capturing it for a time. On their way back, they had a small skirmish with the Japanese army, and the highway bridge outside Qimen</p>
<p>was destroyed by bombing.</p>
<p>Yang's unit safely returned to defense after completing its mission. It is also reported that Taipingqiao Town has been captured by the Chinese army, which has built fortifications and is holding it firmly. As for the New Fourth Army's action unit, it is developing rapidly in the Suzhou-Changzhou area, and its action groups are also active within the city of Suzhou. The assassination of the pseudo "County Magistrate" Guo Zengji is believed to be related to the activities of this unit. However, the rumor that the assassin Zhao Qiang has died for the cause cannot be confirmed.</p>
<h3 id="e49">After Price Controls End, Rice Prices Soar, Coal Briquettes to be Sold at Controlled Prices Again <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>After the fourth phase of controlled-price foreign rice ended on the 5th, rice merchants resumed their speculative manipulation, causing rice prices to gradually rise again. Yesterday, the market price of Saigon No. 1 increased sharply by 2.2 yuan, and the prices of all other grades also increased by more than one yuan. The reason for this is that after the sale of controlled-price foreign rice was discontinued, purchases by the general public and poor people at rice shops increased sharply. Because of the increased demand, the merchants took the opportunity to raise prices. Although the authorities in the concessions have repeatedly prohibited illegal price increases, the profiteers are blinded by greed and disregard everything. Therefore, the authorities should take strict measures to reduce the burden on the common people.</p>
<p>The Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association has decided to hold the eighth phase of controlled-price coal briquette sales and resolved: (1) to sell each five market catties for 0.3 yuan in national currency; (2) to limit each person to a maximum purchase of five market catties per day; (3) to start selling every day from 3:00 PM until supplies are exhausted. As for the date of the controlled-price sales, it was decided according to the previous meeting, starting from the 11th of this month and ending on the 20th, for a period of ten days, and it was internally decided to set up 60 controlled-price selling points in the two concessions. However, the prices of coal briquettes sold at the doors of shops have recently been quite inconsistent, and there may be no determination to suppress prices.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the lunar calendar's first day of autumn. At 5:40 PM, the weather suddenly changed, dark clouds gathered, and a heavy downpour began. The rain was heavier than any seen since the beginning of summer and lasted for two hours before stopping. Low-lying roads throughout the city, such as Jessfield Road, Thibet Road, Connaught Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Guangxi Road, Zhejiang Road, Fuzhou Road, Yunnan Road, and the French Concession's Route Massenet, Rue Wagner, Ximen Road, Route Tenant de Tourville, Rue Lupan, Avenue Joffre and other roads</p>
<p>became swamps.</p>
<p>Vehicles traveled on them as if sailing on land, splashing water and causing pedestrians to complain. Among them, the areas around Jing'an Temple Road in the Public Concession and Route Pueyrredon in the French Concession resembled a wide river. The deepest parts were almost knee-deep. Looking at the Racecourse, it resembled a large lake. At the same time, rickshaw pullers were making ten times their usual profit, charging as much as two yuan per trip.</p>
<p>Sudden High Tide</p>
<p>Furthermore, yesterday coincided with the high autumn tide, so the water on the roads drained very slowly. It has not completely receded by this morning. Yesterday's high tide occurred at 3:45 PM, reaching a height of 10.0 feet, and this morning at 3:59 AM, another high tide reached 10.48 feet.</p>

<p>Yang Jinrui, a Puxi native and owner of the Jin Tai Fashion Company at 301 Tongfu Road, was kidnapped by seven armed bandits at 11:50 AM on July 16th of this year. However, on July 18th, while being held in a shed on Route Cardinal Mercier in western Shanghai, Yang, while the kidnappers were asleep,</p>
<p>secretly escaped,</p>
<p>notified a patrolling policeman, who took Yang to the police station and escorted him home. Unexpectedly, several days later, Yang suddenly received a threatening letter signed "Lu Lin, Deputy Squad Leader of the West Shanghai Special Task Force." The letter stated that Yang should not have escaped on his own and that this letter was a warning, demanding that he contact Manager Yu at the Chinese New Musical Instrument Factory at 1234 Jing'an Temple Road within three days, or his life</p>
<p>would be in great danger.</p>
<p>After Yang reported to the police station, they ordered an investigation at the Chinese factory, where Manager Yu Yapei said that the handwriting on the letter was similar to that of Liu Yongsheng, a worker from Shandong who had been laid off from the factory. On July 31st, Liu was arrested at Route Foch and Weihaiwei Road, taken to the police station, and sent to the court for questioning and detention. Liu's handwriting was sent to the Public Works Department</p>
<p>handwriting expert</p>
<p>Mei for verification. Yesterday morning, Judge Chuan Lin presided over the criminal court to hear the case. Police lawyer Li Zhishan prosecuted on charges of kidnapping and demanding ransom, stating that, according to the handwriting expert's report, there were many similarities between the letter and the defendant's handwriting, confirming that the letter was written by the defendant. Moreover, Song Renfu and Lu Yuping, employees of the Jin Tai Fashion Company, testified that the defendant was present when the owner was kidnapped, and that the owner</p>
<p>had gone to Puxi.</p>
<p>When questioned, the defendant denied everything, claiming innocence and hiring lawyer Wang Xiubo to defend him. Police lawyer Li Zhishan argued that the nature of the case was serious and that the victim should be summoned to court for identification to finalize the verdict. Judge Fu ordered the defendant to be detained for seven days and summoned Yang Jinrui to court for further verification.</p>

<h3 id="e53">Unseasonal Weather, Rampant Seasonal Diseases, True Cholera Cases Continue to be Discovered, Residents Should Pay Attention to Health Preservation <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Since its opening, the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital has been crowded with patients seeking treatment. Yesterday, the number reached 675, and the doctors in the hospital were overwhelmed. Among the patients, in addition to cholera, various gastrointestinal inflammations were rampant. However, after being admitted to the hospital for treatment, their conditions improved significantly. Since the beginning of summer, the hospital has admitted patients, and as of yesterday, the number of confirmed true cholera cases by the Public Works Department's Health Bureau has reached 110. In addition, the hospital has admitted 146 patients with common seasonal diseases, reaching full capacity. According to Deng Qingshan, the medical director of the hospital, the reasons for the sudden surge in seasonal diseases are unseasonal weather and residents' carelessness in their diet. Now that autumn is approaching, various seasonal diseases will become more active, and residents should pay close attention to health preservation and take appropriate precautions. The Shanghai Emergency Epidemic Hospital, jointly sponsored by the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association and the Chinese Red Cross Society at 730 Rue de Consulat, is a completely charitable organization that provides registered outpatient and inpatient services, with all consultation and medicine fees waived. The number of patients seeking treatment is around 300 to 400 per day, so the original 200 beds are not enough, and efforts are being made to expand the facilities. According to Dr. Tong Zhiqing, the medical director of the hospital, since the opening of the hospital last month to the 5th of this month, a total of more than 4,000 patients have been treated, most of whom have gastrointestinal diseases and dysentery. However, the number of true cholera cases confirmed by the Public Works Department's Health Bureau has reached 9. In the past two nights, there have been more than 20 cholera patients, and their stool samples are still being tested by the Public Works Department, so there may be a possibility of further spread. It is hoped that residents in the area will pay attention to summer hygiene. The hospital also provides free vaccinations for prevention. It is reported that the funds are being raised from the new pharmaceutical industry by the hospital's director Xu Xiaochu and deputy directors Xu Xiangsun, Yuan Hesong, Gao Peiliang, Xu Guanqun, and others, who are enthusiastic about charity, truly a blessing for the poor and sick.</p>

<p>Lu Xiangsheng, a local resident residing at 16 Jinyu Lane, Rue Minti, was a Chinese policeman No. 542 in the French Concession. At 8:00 PM on the 23rd of last month, he was walking with his girlfriend past the Slaughterhouse on Rue Pissot, when two hoodlums, Wang Yulin and Zhou Quanbao, stopped them and attempted to snatch Lu's pocket watch. Lu resisted, and a fight broke out between the two sides. Lu was outnumbered and shouted for help. Vietnamese policeman No. 701 heard the cries and stepped forward to take Song and Zhou to the police station. Song and his accomplices then incited their companions to surround the Vietnamese policeman and try to rob him of his gun. Fortunately, a passerby telegraphed the police station, and Detective Qin Bichang rushed to the scene and arrested Song and Zhou. The other defendants are on the run and were jointly sent to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court for prosecution on charges of robbery. The case was tried by Judge Sun yesterday morning, and Song Yulin and Zhou Quanbao, both repeat offenders, were sentenced to two years of imprisonment each for using violence and coercion to force others to hand over property.</p>

<p>In July of this year, the prices of general vegetables in this city tended to rise, and rice prices were particularly high in the first half of the month. The food category was 485.80, an increase of 7.54% compared to June. The rent index for July increased from 304.83 from January to June of this year to 348.19, an increase of 14.22% over the six months. The miscellaneous items index was 404.79, an increase of 2.60% compared to June, due to the increase in the price of tobacco and alcohol. The clothing index continued to fall by 9.22%.

<p>In the second half of July, rice prices showed a significant decline, especially at the end of the month, due to the efforts of the Rice Evaluation Committee. Hong Kong has not banned exports, and a large amount of foreign rice is still being shipped to Shanghai. It is also heard that a large batch of foreign rice has been ordered in order to suppress the market price, and negotiations have been conducted with the banking sector. However, due to the high market price of No. 2 japonica rice in the first half of the month, the average price per shi this month still reached 66 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen, an increase of 10.70% compared to last month; the price of No. 2 Saigon was 59 yuan 6 jiao 6 fen, an increase of</p>

<p>Recently, commodity prices have skyrocketed. Due to foreign relations, the price of imported gasoline has risen sharply. Several car drivers in this city have been stealing gasoline and reselling it to car companies. Some have even organized companies specializing in collecting stolen gasoline in large quantities and selling it to car companies. The car driver of Western doctor Litongslin has stolen a large amount of gasoline, which was discovered by Litongslin. However, he did not make it public. When he found out that he was trading with the clerk of the oil collection company, he reported it to the Puxi police, arrested him, and seized more than ten barrels of gasoline, which were sent to the court. According to the clerk, he is currently unemployed, so he collects stolen gasoline to make a living. Ten barrels of gasoline can earn a profit of 165 yuan, and then he distributes the profit equally with the car drivers according to the amount of gasoline they supply. The company's holder escaped when he heard the news. The police found an account book on the spot, recording the car numbers of the transactions.

<p>(Guilin Correspondent) The Guangxi Provincial Government believes that most Chinese educational supplies come from foreign countries. After the war of resistance, due to traffic disruptions, sources were lacking, and prices were high, making purchases difficult. To achieve self-sufficiency, the Guangxi Provincial Science Experiment Museum was transformed into the Guangxi Provincial Educational Supplies Manufacturing Plant in March of last year. It is located in Tiandong and uses local raw materials to manufacture various educational supplies. In the past year, the products have included specimens, models, plaster portraits, children's toys, and daily stationery. The goods are of high quality, and the prices are lower than imported products. However, because the products are made by hand, large-scale production is not possible, resulting in insufficient supply. To meet supply and demand, it was decided to expand the plant and use machinery to produce some of the products. It is planned that starting from the next academic year, all educational supplies and instruments for primary and secondary schools in the province will be supplied by the plant to enrich them. All daily stationery required by various agencies in the province will also be supplied by the plant.</p>

<p>(Xingning Correspondent) This year's unified enrollment for public colleges and universities has a branch in Meixian, which is convenient for students in the eastern Guangdong Han River area and the Fujian-Jiangxi border area. Therefore, those who went to register for the exam were extremely enthusiastic, reaching more than 500 people. However, because some students' graduation certificates indicated that they had studied in the senior high school department for three years, but had not obtained a certificate for more than a year; others had graduated for two years, but still had not obtained a certificate, and the school authorities falsely certified that they were graduating this year; some only had certificates issued by the school, but without the school seal and the principal's signature, but only the seal of the dean of academic affairs. After the examination committee reviewed and found them unqualified, they were not allowed to register. Therefore, only 332 people were able to obtain registration qualifications and have completed the examination on July 23. The remaining more than 300 students who did not obtain registration qualifications are awaiting other arrangements. According to Director Li Baihua, the details of the enrollment process will be reported to the authorities, and schools that indiscriminately recruit students for profit will also be asked to be rectified to prevent future problems and serve as a warning to others. Although there were many examinees this time, most of the students' test papers were not satisfactory. The quality of education needs to be improved urgently. Those responsible for education should pay attention at all times, and students in school should also work hard in time.</p>

<p>(Shaoguan Telegram) The Guangdong Provincial Children's Education Institute is making rapid progress in accommodating and nurturing refugee children from war zones. A reporter recently visited the person in charge of the institute, who said that the number of children in the institute is as follows: 962 in the first institute, 1,531 in the second institute, 1,125 in the third institute, 285 in the fourth institute, and 625 in the fifth institute, totaling 4,628 people. The children who first came to the institutes were mostly suffering from diseases and had bad habits. Starting the nurturing process was extremely difficult, but through the efforts of enthusiastic staff members, various tasks have gradually taken shape. The most obvious result is that the children in the institutes have become stronger, the mortality rate has gradually been eliminated, and bad habits have been completely corrected, gradually transforming them into well-disciplined and excellent children. The guiding principle of rescue education in the institute is to enable children to acquire the minimum necessary production skills, so special emphasis is placed on production education. The established classes include agriculture, agronomy, horticulture, forestry, animal husbandry, and industry, including weaving straw sandals, sewing, and other small industries. The monthly cost for each child is 12 yuan. Due to high prices, this is greatly insufficient.</p>

<h3 id="e71">Gold Market Rise Is Sharp, Yesterday Breaking the 5,700 Yuan Mark, Many Outside the Industry Bought for Collection <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold black market rose sharply, exceeding the 5,700 yuan mark. The market sentiment was exceptionally firm. In addition to bullish traders, there were many outside the industry secretly commissioning purchases for collection. After the rise, every setback was due to profit-taking by short-term traders. The market opened at 5,680 yuan. Subsequently, banks and gold shops bought in, and a certain currency exchange business covered its short positions, pushing the price up to 5,715 yuan. Before long, due to profit-taking sales by banks and other parties, and the currency exchange business subsequently reversed its position, the price fell back to 5,660 yuan. Before the close, gold shops alone snapped up gold, raising the price to 5,720 yuan. Although there was a slight retreat after the purchase, the market closed at 5,695 yuan. Market sentiment remained positive, and securities firms and gold shops bought again, pushing the price from the opening price of 5,705 yuan to 5,730 yuan. The closing price was suppressed by bank sales, but it was still 5,718 yuan, an increase of 68 yuan compared to the previous day. Trading volume was strong, totaling approximately 3,000 taels. Jewelry gold was priced 10 yuan higher, and customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Rises Again by 68 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the start of the morning, the price per bar (10 taels) was raised by 30 yuan due to the tight exchange market. Securities firms sold 30 taels at 5,680 yuan. Subsequently, due to aggressive buying by both gold and silver firms, and a certain currency exchange business covering its short positions, and the continued healthy demand from Hong Kong firms, the price was pushed up by another 40 yuan. Securities firms traded 20 taels among themselves, raising the price to 5,720 yuan. Suddenly, a certain currency exchange business switched from buying to selling, and the foreign exchange rate strengthened, causing long-term traders to take profits. Securities firms, banks, and currency exchange businesses sold heavily. Although gold firms still bought in from time to time, the price was ultimately suppressed by selling pressure, falling to a low of 5,660 yuan. At that time, the amount of short-term selling decreased, and gold firms still had a strong appetite for buying, so the price reached the 5,700 yuan mark before the close, but the closing price was 5,695 yuan. The underlying trend was initially flat, then firm. Transactions were seen at 5,705 yuan. In the afternoon, securities firms first bought 10 taels from banks at 5,705 yuan, and banks traded 10 taels among themselves, retreating to 5,700 yuan. Subsequently, gold firms and securities firms bought in successively, gradually increasing the price by 30 yuan. Securities firms sold 10 taels to gold firms, raising the price to 5,730 yuan. After that purchase, banks sold continuously, so the closing price retreated to 5,718 yuan, an increase of 68 yuan compared to the previous day. After the close, the market showed some weakness due to the slightly stronger foreign exchange rate. The last transaction was at 5,690 yuan. The price fluctuated by 70 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of gold from cash gold shops was several tens of yuan higher than the spot gold price, and the buying price was lowered by 30 yuan.

<p>After currency exchange businesses learned that counterfeit 100 US dollar notes had been discovered in Hong Kong, some businesses refused to accept these large notes as a precaution, causing concern among those holding them. The industry also felt inconvenienced. Therefore, industry members convened a meeting to discuss the matter. It was agreed that all transactions would be allowed to trade large and small notes together. This measure is relatively appropriate, and public confidence can be slightly restored. At the same time, the circulation of funds will not be affected. Therefore, the market price should not change suddenly. As for yesterday's market conditions, spot gold rose to exceed the 700 yuan mark, and the British pound and US dollar also rose by 1.5 yuan. However, after the closing, as the gold price fell below 700 yuan, sentiment was particularly weak. Demand for British pound notes remained strong, and the market price continued to rise by 0.3 yuan. The US dollar note once reached a high of 18.1 yuan, and was 18.05 yuan at 3:30 PM. After 3:30 PM, it was suddenly reported that a certain bank in the black market had sold spot US dollars at 5.5625 yuan, causing a sudden drop in confidence, and the price fell back into the 18 yuan mark. The final price was 17.95 yuan, still an increase of 0.1 yuan compared to the previous day. Demand for Hong Kong notes remained strong, and the price exceeded the 4 yuan mark. The trend of Japanese yen notes remained positive, and the evening market was 1.325 yuan. The supply and demand for Korean notes remained balanced, and the evening market remained at the original price of 1.095 yuan.</p>

(Zu)</p>
<p>Since the foreign rice market tightened again after the previous setback, the market opened positively yesterday. Local shops actively sold to inland merchants, and speculative traders were generally excited, absorbing short positions and taking profits at high prices in endless succession. As a result, prices rose by more than 0.5 yuan in the morning due to mutual speculation. Afterwards, the prices continued to rise higher, flying all the way up, and all prices rose by around 1.5 yuan compared to the previous market. The price of No. 1 Chen Saigon was 59.5 yuan, No. 2 was 54.5 yuan. The prices of original-packaged re-exported goods were especially volatile, with B merchants and re-export traders actively trading. The asking price for re-exported No. 2 Saigon rice opened at 64.5 yuan, then rose to 64.9 yuan. The asking price for imported rice also rose from 64 yuan to 64.56 yuan. The asking price for re-exported No. 2 Siamese rice once rose to 65 yuan, an increase of 2 yuan compared to the selling price the day before. Saigon broken rice also reached 52.8 yuan.

The price of original-packaged Saigon and Siamese rice immediately fell to 64 yuan, and the asking price for imported mixed-grade rice was 63.5 yuan, but there were few buyers. However, both buying and selling were active, totaling over 500 tons. The price of spot rice initially rose, then fell, ultimately rising by about 1 yuan.

<p>The arrival of glutinous rice was scarce, and sales remained broad, so the market was relatively positive. The price increased by 0.5 yuan.

<p>Share Market Dark Trading: Yesterday's market continued to decline. Although there was much short covering, both short sellers and long position closers were quite active. This was due to the sudden tension in Vietnam and the continued sharp rise in gold prices, which made people feel uneasy. Prices of Type A and E shares fell the most, because it was known that there were many receivers of Type A shares on the floor, who followed the trend and immediately disposed of their holdings when the market price fluctuated slightly, thus leading to small drops. Type B shares, on the other hand, did not show any trading throughout the day, indicating a stalemate between the two sides. Yesterday morning, Twelve and Sixteen sold Type A shares, and Hengfu sold Type C shares most actively. Jiufeng, Xinchang, and Wutai slightly covered their short positions, while the rest had sporadic transactions, which were also quite lively. In the afternoon, Yongkang bought Type C and sold Type A, Yuan Yu took in a significant amount of Type C, Gong Mao absorbed Type E, and Zhongyi and Hongda took advantage of the low prices to buy Type A. Hengfu, Lianyi, Chengkang, etc. sold a significant amount of Type C. The market fluctuated greatly in the morning and stabilized in the afternoon. As a result, except for Type B shares, which did not have any initial transactions, all other shares declined by a small amount, ranging from two to four jiao. The total transaction volume was approximately 700,000 yuan. A summary table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: Thirty shares of China Banking Corporation were traded at a price of thirteen yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public utilities stock market was very stable, with many transactions and no significant price declines. Wheelock &amp; Co. announced a dividend of five yuan per share for the previous term, which will be paid on August 30th. This seems to be quite attractive to general investors, so the price of the stock has been rising continuously. Due to the rise in Wheelock's stock, the shares of various trust companies have also become extraordinarily stable. Rubber shares are quiet, but the underlying trend is firm.</p>
<p>London, July 7th (Wednesday) Electric Dispatch: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign bonds and stocks of British companies in the Far East were all calm, with no changes in the market.</p>
<p>Wheelock &amp; Co., Ltd. will hold its ninth annual shareholders' meeting on August 30th to report on the business situation for the year ending March 1940, distribute the final dividend of five yuan per share in national currency, and re-elect directors and amend the articles of association.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Yarn and Cotton - Large Investors Sell at High Prices, Cotton Yarn Chits - Increasingly Abundant <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market started rising but then weakened, showing a sign of softening. Foreign exchange is still tight, and yarn prices have failed to track upwards. This is due to sluggish actual transactions and poor transportation from all sides, which has led to scattered morale. Moreover, many veteran players, seeing the situation as not strong, are instead selling off. The biggest reason for the recent weakness in the yarn market is that tea factories are selling on the market, making the floor looser. Although the majority are bullish, abundant chits are putting heavy pressure.</p>
<p>The yarn market opened this morning with a favorable mood among retail investors due to the continued contraction of foreign exchange, and buying interest was strong. Twenty-count Double Horse yarn was priced at 1,020 yuan. Unexpectedly, as soon as this price was announced, certain firms rushed to sell their holdings. Although the bulls struggled to resist, the floor had already loosened. Small investors could not compete with large investors. Although gold is expensive, cotton yarn still cannot rise. The closing price was 1,014 yuan, but all subsequent floating profits were closed, gradually falling to 1,008 yuan. It is estimated that 2,020 bales were traded in half a day. The market price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was about the same as the previous day. Today, 245 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong and 51 bales to Haikou. The quantities bought by various groups are listed below:</p>

<p>Trading in spot cotton remains good. Various Chinese and foreign factories are gradually becoming active in purchasing, so people are somewhat more at ease. However, payments are all delayed by one to two months. Today, 85 bales of cotton were shipped to Haikou. The spot cotton transaction situation is listed below:</p>
<p>Yesterday, 1,000 bales of American cotton arrived in Shanghai on the Aquerius, a ship managed by the American President Lines. The ship entered the port the night before and docked at Qichang Pier in Pudong. Unloading began yesterday morning.</p>

<p>Yesterday's cooking oil market saw a generally optimistic attitude in the market. This was due to stable production prices, delayed sources, and the excitement caused by the rising gold price. As a result, prices rose by two to three yuan compared to the previous day. Transactions included 100 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil at a price of 65.5 to 66.5 yuan, 50 pieces of Yantai raw oil at 65.5 yuan, 50 barrels of Qingdao raw oil at 93.4 yuan, 50 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil at 68.5 yuan, 100 pieces of Qingqi soybean oil at 69 yuan, 50 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil at 70 yuan, 180 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil at 94 to 96 yuan, 150 barrels of Dalian oil at 95.5 to 97 yuan, and 3,150 dan of Dayouyu factory soybean oil at 75.5 to 76 yuan.</p>

<p>Famous scenic spots throughout the country, whether a stream, a tree, a pavilion, or a platform, contemporary notables and prominent figures invariably desire to revive what has been abandoned and replenish what is lacking, in order to provide for leisurely contemplation and enhance the pleasure of sightseeing. How much more so when it is greatly beneficial to the people? The Lian Lake in Danyang stretches for dozens of miles and has four sluices for storing water to aid in the transport of tribute grain. It also has nine culverts for diverting water to irrigate fields. In times of drought, it provides sustenance to alleviate the hunger of the people, and in times of flood, it provides fish and seafood to relieve the poverty of the people. Its importance to the national economy and the welfare of the people is not like the Sacred Lake of Wulin, which merely possesses the beauty of mountains and waters, or the Yuan Lake of Zhuli, which serves only for the enjoyment of scholars. Within it, there are islands and pavilions suitable for singing and resting. The pavilion is dedicated to General Liu Meng, for his control of locusts. Since the wars, the pavilions have been destroyed and are overgrown with weeds, causing all who see them to lament the changes of the past. At the beginning of this month, local residents Mr. Lin Ziwan, Mr. Pan Xingu, Mr. Jiang Youtang, and Mr. He Runsheng toured the lake. The so-called Lake Pavilion consisted only of six dilapidated paper-covered rooms, not only with openings on all sides but also unable to provide shelter from rain and snow, truly causing sighs! Moreover, the work of dredging the lake has been neglected for a long time. In the future, if the lake is needed but unable to function effectively, how can it be blamed on the lake? County Magistrate Commander Gong is attentive to important matters of governance, and the people all appreciate him. If he can muster his remaining strength to revitalize the lake and restore its former state, his effort of one day will benefit the people for a hundred years. The people of this region are all watching and hoping for it!</p>

<h3 id="e82">Regarding "The Happiness of Apprentices" <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>In three days, we received forty letters from apprentices. More than half of them seem to have only attended school for one or two years (mainly in rural private schools), and the rest are not much higher than elementary school level. However, their thirst for knowledge is equally strong.</p>
<p>We are very happy that they wrote many articles about apprentices, and even happier that this issue has attracted the attention of the apprentices themselves. However, due to space constraints, we cannot publish all the letters.</p>
<p>At the same time, Mr. Cao Lingyou also sent a letter: After reading the articles "Regarding the Happiness of Apprentices" and "After Reading The Happiness of Apprentices" on August 5th, I am very grateful to Mr. Shi Wei and Mr. Ding Ren for their kind criticisms and corrections to my humble work "The Happiness of Apprentices." However, I cannot help but say a few more words here. I wrote "The Happiness of Apprentices" entirely because I saw an article discussing apprentices, which said that apprentices are mostly depressed, selfish, and self-interested. Therefore, I wrote "The Happiness of Apprentices" with good intentions to encourage apprentices in general to know where to strive and where to work hard.</p>
<p>I am not only happy that my own articles have received criticism and gained progress. I am even happier for the tens of thousands of apprentices because this issue has attracted widespread attention.</p>
<p>Now we want to temporarily end this issue because Mr. Ding Ren and Mr. Shi Wei have already made very strong appeals in their articles for improving the lives of apprentices and how to seek the true happiness of apprentices. However, we still welcome discoveries from theory to practice.</p>
<h3 id="e83">By the Side of the Old Zha Gate Bridge <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Ju Ju</p>
<p>This kind of thing may not be rare. Because I have been going in and out for several years, I see this kind of thing almost every day. There are certainly many pedestrians who often walk through the Old Zha Gate Bridge on Beijing Road, so their feelings may be even more profound than mine.</p>
<p>The things that happen in this area are—theft and robbery. Suppose it is morning. Look: housewives, maids, and mess cooks, are crowding into and out of this noisy vegetable market shoulder to shoulder. In their baskets, some place fish and meat, vegetables, and others chicken eggs and salted fish. The vegetable market is full of noise, and the outside is chaotic. Therefore, people buying vegetables, whether going in or out, have difficulty guarding against the group of thieves.</p>
<p>The three young bums in the crowd over there whispered for a while, and then another one tiptoed forward. A middle-aged woman was walking in front, with dishes in her basket that did not make him happy. He followed for a few steps, and suddenly reached out and a piece of meat was silently taken into his hand. As soon as he said it, he quickly turned around, with a slight look of panic on his face, and regardless of whether the other party chased him or had not yet noticed, he had already run away.</p>
<p>The pedestrians on the side smiled knowingly, watching the agile thief disappear from the crowd. And in front, the woman carrying the basket of lost meat was still walking slowly, unaware, and the pedestrians laughed again. This group of old and young, and female thieves, are constantly wandering there. They are working alone or together. Their hunger is maintained by this work.</p>
<p>A few hours after the vegetable market has settled, this place begins to squirm again. Large trucks, wheelbarrows, and vegetable vendors carrying vegetables, meat, and fish on their shoulders come in droves, which gives you another opportunity to see them acting.</p>
<p>A young thief with long hair closely followed a large truck. He ran hundreds of yards without discouragement, and finally the truck braked because there was an obstacle in front. Immediately, like an athlete in the final minute, he forcefully pulled at the accumulated target, got it, immediately stepped on the gas and ran away.</p>
<p>A rickshaw stopped in the crowd of vegetable vendors. The rural vegetable vendor sitting in the rickshaw untied the vegetables hanging behind, and found that the opening of the bag had been torn and a third of the vegetables were missing.</p>
<p>Old men and old women vegetable vendors are their best targets. They sometimes grab large cabbages, wild rice stems, lotus roots, etc., and sometimes cotton, melons, iron bars, etc., as their trophies. They hold the purpose of taking whatever they can, regardless of cars driving by, regardless of the sticks waved by the guards on the trucks, and ignoring the insults of the vegetable vendors. They do this year after year, season after season, living their lives.</p>
<p>This kind of thing is really too common, but every time I see it, I still hope that it will not be as common as it is now. The minimum hope is to turn the common thing into "rare."</p>
<h3 id="e84">Little Sanzi and Master Wang <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yu</p>
<p>Little Sanzi has no relatives and no home. He has been living at the entrance of our alley for almost three months.</p>
<p>Alone, he goes to the newspaper office every morning and evening to wait for the newspapers. After receiving the newspapers, he returns to the alley to distribute them to the residents. This is how he maintains his life.</p>
<p>The residents of the alley always say, "Send it to Little Sanzi at the alley entrance" whenever they have leftover food, because people remember Little Sanzi like that, because Little Sanzi has none of the wildness of a street urchin.</p>
<p>But Little Sanzi was finally driven away by Master Wang. Master Wang is the big landlord in our village. He himself lives in this village. He usually goes in and out in a very extravagant manner, with bodyguards and a car. But for some reason, Master Wang recently dismissed the bodyguards and the chauffeur and started walking in and out. (Many people say that he is practicing a new life, but others say that Master Wang's "business" has been losing money lately.)</p>
<p>Little Sanzi had bad luck because Master Wang was walking. Because that day, when Master Wang walked into the alley panting from the speculative market, he saw Little Sanzi's torn mat and iron can containing a lot of smelly things at the entrance of the alley. So he roared at the watchman:</p>
<p>"Damn it, what are you in charge of? How did this kind of stinky thing get brought in by this bum?"</p>
<p>His tone was very fierce, and the watchman bowed his head and responded obsequiously.</p>
<p>"I don't allow bums to enter my alley! Look how filthy this is! If this happens again next time, you can get out yourself!"</p>
<p>Little Sanzi pouted and didn't dare to say a word. He just dragged his torn mat and other things out of the alley. Master Wang stroked his mustache, glared fiercely at the watchman, and then strode inside.</p>
<p>The next day, Little Sanzi was still holding a stack of newspapers and distributing them to each household, but after finishing the distribution, he quickly slipped out of the alley. People outside the alley asked him where he had stayed last night, and he said he had stayed on the cement road of a foreign house.</p>
<p>Some people said: Master Wang used to drive in and out, so he didn't pay attention to the bum Little Sanzi at the entrance of the alley. Now that he is running around on his own feet, he has become sharp-eyed. In fact, Master Wang wouldn't have missed this filthy little bum even when he was in the car, but at that time his nerves didn't care about these trivial matters.</p>
<p>So Little Sanzi's expulsion seems to be Little Sanzi's misfortune, but it is actually more unfortunate for Master Wang.</p>

<p>Qian Chunsong colluded with others to scare and defraud his younger brother by posting a notice demanding rent on the outside of the Dafeng Company. He was arrested after the matter was exposed. A poem:</p>
<p>Fratricide has been lamented since ancient times,</p>

<p>— Mo Leng</p>
<p>To the students who came south from the former capital: Indeed, at a time when our country still attaches considerable importance to admission qualifications, it is indeed inconvenient for you in various ways, but from the situation you described, it does not seem to be a hopeless situation. It is just a question of whether there are other effective methods. Therefore, I firmly ask you to wait a little longer before leaving.</p>
<p>Have you tried the following methods?</p>
<p>1.  The Ministry of Education stipulates methods for those with equivalent academic ability. I believe you can at least prove that you have equivalent academic ability.</p>
<p>2.  Request to be a probationary student and participate in the screening test in the future (this method is stipulated by the Ministry of Education this year).</p>
<p>3.  Tell the person in charge of the school about your difficulties and ask them to temporarily accept you and submit it to the Ministry of Education for remedial measures.</p>
<p>4.  Directly request relief from the educational authorities.</p>
<p>5.  Temporarily enter universities such as Shengde and Han, and gradually seek to transfer schools.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope you have not left yet.</p>

<p>— By Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Bad News</p>
<p>As the elevator slowly ascended, Hawthorne pressed the bell on the steel door and turned back to the window. I saw that his face was somber, his brows furrowed, and his eyes stared out at the densely arranged rooftops of various heights outside the window. He reached into his pocket to pull out his cigarette case.</p>
<p>I leaned my elbow on the window sill and took the opportunity to ask, "Hawthorne, I think that girlfriend who stayed here for two nights, is she Wang Lilan?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne was still staring at the rooftops bathed in sunlight and nodded, "Of course, there is no doubt about that—but there is one thing I really don't understand."</p>
<p>I hurriedly asked, "What is it?—Is it worth your frowning and pondering like this?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne slowly replied, "Why did Wang Lilan come here to spend the night?"</p>
<p>I couldn't help but burst out laughing, "Do you need to spend time guessing about this? They naturally have their relationship—no, to put it bluntly, this cannot be considered a relationship. It is clearly for a kind of simple and shameless carnal desire."</p>
<p>Hawthorne shook the hand holding the cigarette. "That's not it, you misunderstood. Why didn't she let Zhao Boxiong stay in her own home? Since that Mr. Lu is very permissive of women and can openly spend the night at her home, why is she so particular about this Mr. Zhao?"</p>
<p>I thought for a while and of course couldn't come up with a reasonable answer, so I vaguely said, "Maybe it's a kind of special relationship that is viewed differently."</p>
<p>This explanation of course didn't satisfy Hawthorne. He puffed on his cigarette in silence. At this time, the elevator rose to the seventh floor, the steel door opened, and two male guests came out. Hawthorne glanced at them and then turned back to look out the window. The elevator continued to rise.</p>
<p>I said again, "Zhao Boxiong came back in the rain last night around one o'clock. In terms of time, he has a close relationship with the murder. After returning, he hurried off again. Can you admit that his suspicion is the heaviest?" (70)</p>

<p>— Yong Shun</p>
<p>Considering them, shouldn't we feel ashamed!</p>
<p>Since the war between Britain and Germany, British stars in Hollywood have been mindful of their homeland. As long as it is something that benefits their homeland, they do their best. Now, let's briefly describe their recent activities:</p>
<p>Colemen, Errol Flynn, and others recently formed the "British Army Service of Hollywood," whose main task is to raise medical supplies, etc. Colemen serves as the captain and engages in activities. French star Charles Boyer is also an honorary member of the team in the capacity of friendship.</p>
<p>Lee J. Cobb and Louis Hayward are within the age range for military service stipulated by the British government (21 to 31 years old), so both of them will return home after completing their new films.</p>
<p>Victor McLaglen, who is very fond of children, has funded the establishment of the "McLaglen Children's Club" and is now planning to expand it greatly in order to accommodate some of the refugee children from Britain, providing them with appropriate education and entertainment.</p>
<p>Cary Grant will also donate all of his 150,000 yuan in compensation from his new Universal film to refugee children from Britain.</p>
<p>Horror star Karloff also telegraphed the authorities, volunteering to bear the expenses for sixty refugee children to go to Canada.</p>
<p>Freddie Bartholomew is determined to join the army, but because he is too young, he has not been allowed to, so he has to stay at home and study books related to military affairs.</p>
<p>Basil Rathbone, Charles Laughton, Lee Silian Howard, etc., have also donated their salaries or designated them for refugee relief or for the treatment of wounded soldiers to show that they are not lagging behind in saving the country.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Miscellaneous Notes on Listening to Opera <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Chu</p>
<p>On the fourth of the month, Mao Shilai performed the "Article Meeting" and "Stabbing Ba Jie." I drove to watch. When I arrived at the theater, "Hanging the Seal and Sealing Gold" was already on stage. Little San Mazi's red student, is considered one of the best in the South with Lin Shusen. The two artists have their own strengths. Lin is good at singing, but his stage presence is slightly inferior to Little San Mazi. Unfortunately, the running horses and circling the stage in this play were all omitted. Only in the arrival scene and the farewell to Cao, there were a few movements and poses, but they were already extremely beautiful. Cheng Shaoyu is originally a skilled martial clown, but now he plays Cao Cao, directly imitating a maid learning from her mistress, not daring to look directly at him. Following was Wang Zhongchen's "Baisuitan." This play is a laborious play for short-hitting martial students, and now Gai Jiaotian is the best at it. From the self-curse hall onwards that day, when the eleventh son went on stage in the fourth scene, his appearance was still handsome. His dialogue cannot be compared with the northern Yang school martial students such as Gao Shenglin and Wu Yanheng. The baton dance and kicking belt all showed skill. The fight with the Blue-Faced Tiger should have been fierce and compact, without involving chaos. The fight that day was not exciting. Following was Chen Shaolin's "Selling the Horse." This play is regarded as a daunting task by amateur performers, because Qin Qiong's hands and horse-hoof sleeves are turned up, and there are no water sleeves to cover them, so they feel awkward and uneasy about where to put their hands. The shopkeeper's eastern section should be sung in a quiet and melancholic way, full of charm. At that time, Qin Qiong was ill and in distress, so he should not sing loudly, which would not conform to the plot. Shaolin sang this section without any flaws, but the breath was uneven. It was okay when it was high, but almost inaudible when it was low. "Article Meeting" is a playful comedy. The scene is too scattered and loose. The scene where the young master and the servant both suffer from lovesickness is laughable. Mao Shilai's Ping'er only has a section of the "Moonlight, Flower Shadows Shine on the Gauze Window" tune, and his voice is clear and bright, which is indeed much improved compared to his last visit to Shanghai. Therefore, this time he can perform the entire "Jade Hall Spring" and "Fourth Son Visiting His Mother." The closing act was "Stabbing Ba Jie." Shilai's Ma Jinding is indeed not weak in martial arts. She hit the iron threshold twice in a row, and the flying leaves were clean and neat, but sometimes it seemed too casual. Chen Shaolin's first part, Luo Hongxun, from the second yellow shake board in the store to the four sentences "Sitting in the recruitment store, tears are rolling down," the singing was resonant and smooth, which was the greatest gain from listening to the opera that day. His appearance with a beard is also better. The second part, Luo Hongzhu, was Wang Zhongchen, with only one fighting scene. Ai Shiju's Hu Li is just right for his role. His short steps and knife jumping over the iron threshold are extremely agile. He is a talented martial clown. Yuan Shihai's Bao Si'an has few scenes and could not show his strengths.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Chaplin Photo Worth Millions <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>Life magazine publishes Chaplin's photo without authorization - the verdict adopts a compromise</p>
<p>The sixth work of the comedy master Chaplin, titled "The Great Dictator," has been in production for years, and people are eagerly waiting for it. Now news has come that this film, which is about to cause a sensation in the world, is ready to be released soon.</p>
<p>Chaplin himself is keeping the film a secret, but a long time ago, news has been revealed that the content of "The Great Dictator" is that Chaplin plays both a prisoner detained in a concentration camp and his leader. Because of their similar appearance and small mustaches, somehow the prisoner and the leader become unrecognizable. Originally a prisoner, he actually became the leader, while the real leader was detained in a concentration camp.</p>
<p>The world has a general impression of the outline of the story of "The Great Dictator," but it is a pity that no one has seen a photo of Chaplin playing the leader Hitler. Until last month, the editors of the American "Life" pictorial weekly used all means to find Chaplin's precious photo of playing Hitler. In this photo, Chaplin is wearing a uniform, with a tall and majestic hat, and the national emblem on the hat is two diagonal cross shapes. The editors of "Life" weekly wrote a letter to notify Chaplin on the one hand and published the photo on the other hand, but unexpectedly, a major event occurred.</p>
<p>It turned out that two days after Chaplin's photography studio received the letter, it sued "Life" weekly in court, arguing that the publication of this photo, once published, would greatly reduce the five million yuan in profits that "The Great Dictator" could have steadily obtained. Therefore, it demanded compensation for losses of one million yuan.</p>
<p>"Life" weekly also hired a lawyer to defend, saying that this photo is currently of concern to the world, so it was published. Chaplin immediately ordered to stop the publication after receiving the letter, so there would be no problem, but unexpectedly, he sued in court. As a result, both parties negotiated a compromise solution. The court ordered a ban on the publication of Chaplin's photos of playing the dictator. More than 1.8 million copies of "Life" weekly with this photo printed had already been issued and could not be recovered. More than 1.1 million copies that had not yet been printed removed the photo and replaced it with a photo of auto king Ford visiting the army's destroyer. A lawsuit was finally settled.</p>
<p>(Editor's note) According to another rumor: "This lawsuit is a clever way for both parties to use it for publicity." What exactly is the case, we certainly do not know, so we can only report it later.</p>
<h3 id="e91">How Are Movies Made? <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Regarding the sound in sound films, many are faked. For instance, violently waving a thin sheet of lead with both hands can create the sound of thunder. The sound of a car engine is often produced by a specially made whistle. Striking a cloth covering with numerous rattan sticks can produce the sound of a volley of gunfire. Throwing beans into a very curved tube can create the sound of ocean waves. Recently, someone even invented an electrically powered machine that can produce many different kinds of fake sounds, so ingenious it's beyond description!</p>
<p>(8) Amateur Filmmaking</p>
<p>The materials required for amateur filmmaking are quite expensive. The cost of a camera is definitely beyond the financial means of ordinary people. Furthermore, the photographic accessories are numerous and bulky, making them difficult to carry. To accommodate ordinary people's amateur filmmaking, there are specially made cameras for amateurs on the market. These cameras are much simpler than those used by regular film production companies. The price is also much cheaper, and the volume is small, making them very portable. There are two types of film used: the first type is exactly the same size as the film used by ordinary film production companies. The second type is slightly smaller. The biggest limitation of these amateur cameras compared to regular cameras is that the length of the film produced is extremely limited. Some are only ten meters long, while others are forty, sixty, etc., with the longest being no more than one hundred meters. Therefore, the screening time is only very short. However, being able to film and screen on your own is already interesting enough!</p>
<p>Although movies have reached a very developed stage, their future is still limitless. Just look, stereoscopic movies are already emerging, and I'm afraid they will be available to the public in another year or two. According to current rough estimates, there are more than 60,000 movie theaters worldwide, with tens of millions of viewers, and movies are now recognized as the greatest tool for promoting culture and mass entertainment. Seeing such a grand scene, the founding fathers who spent their days hiding in laboratories researching and inventing movies, such as Edison, Muybridge, Plateau, the Lumière brothers, etc., must be smiling from their graves!
