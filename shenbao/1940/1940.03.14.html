<p>社評</p>
<h3>芬蘇恢復和平之因果</h3>
<p>芬蘭蘇聯息戰媾和事，本報昨論之爲談判成敗，『歐戰擴大與否之關鍵也，世界大局漸趨安定抑愈趨險惡之關鍵也』，『竊以萬分誠悃、期以圓滿解決』；乃僅越一宵，昨晨即以雙方簽字聞；國際糾紛至是而解脫重要之一環，人類理智至是而尅服反常之一端；此可欣慰，久乎未遘矣。</p>
<p>芬蘇戰事發動於去年十一月杪。迄昨晨簽約止。血戰歷時一百四日。戰爭之前，兩國外交折衝綦久，交涉內容與破裂眞相，未經公表；綜合各方所透露者，僅知蘇聯當時之要求於芬蘭者甚奢。此次和約之生要條款，昨由蘇聯國營之塔斯通信社作非正式之發表。領土轉讓情形大體可覩；然詳細疆界有待雙方組織混合委員會勘察確定之。因此之故，戰前要求與戰後妥協，尙無正式資料，取作切實對比。然戰前要求之苛酷，其程度乃爲芬蘭所寗歸毀滅，不甘接受，斯作殊死戰；今茲妥協之方案，其程度乃爲芬蘭所認爲克保國族之獨立自由，斯犧牲所可犧牲以安國是；於是推知蘇聯所求所得，較戰前爲讓步矣。和約於領土問題之外，具有政治性質之條款一；即第三條規定『簽約國雙力均須避免彼此攻襲行動，並不得與反對任何一方面之國家聯盟　合作』云，此種相互而消極性之約束，其無礙於芬蘭主權，亦猶然然無礙於蘇聯主權，固近頃國際各種互不侵犯協定中所習兒之條款也。</p>
<p>和約若斯，斯不將發生疑問曰，然則芬蘇當初何所爲而交戰乎？人類偶有理智反常之時，世間輒有悔不當初之事；其時其事，每每祗可慨歎而無可解答，此不惟芬蘇戰爭若此而已。强作解人，勉求解答，則曰：蘇聯對此百日戰爭，根本並非有計劃之發動；芬蘭對此百日戰爭，慷慨赴死之傑作也。慷慨赴死，情豈得已。夫以蘇聯初無作戰之意而竟然戰。戰以卵石之勢而曳然和；且戰後取償者，復不若戰前外交談判所要素之苛酷；則昨日莫斯科電稱：『此乃蘇聯政府志在和平之一大明證』云云，自未可以虛誇矯情目之，竊與有同感焉。</p>
<p>抑當前之疑問，不在所謂芬蘇當初何所爲而交戰，乃在今茲究竟何所爲而議和？謂爲交戰者理智恢復，謂爲蘇聯志切和平，似是矣，似不足。蓋和議無成，或不相議和，則有顯見之可能成就二焉：蘇聯挾其雄偉之力量，趁此春暖之時機，以此攻芬，雖謂易如搏兎，亦不爲過；毀滅現實，扶植傀儡，此蘇聯得以戰爭致之者，一也。芬蘭乞援英法，英法援芬抗俄；此在芬蘭早已取得英法之諾言，此在英法亦有整裝待發之表示；於是歐洲兩組戰爭，化合爲一；第一次歐戰時，比國國十盡失，而卒能卓立於戰後，以彼例此，此芬蘭得以戰爭致之者，二也。在砲火交加，血肉橫飛之際，新讐宿怨，幾乎不共戴天矣，若使無餘力，無前途，不得已而息戰，猶可說也；今乃雙方各有其繼續作戰，爭取最後勝利之可能，而竟曳然和者，得不謂爲戰時羣衆心理狀態中之變態乎？</p>
<p>內慕如何，非吾儕身居局外者所獲聞知。瞻顧前後，試作肊測，有可得而言者：蘇聯之國際政策，以和平自處爲骨幹。去年先之以出兵波蘭，繼之以出兵芬蘭，雖反應逈殊，然其本意之出兵非以赴戰，則先後絕無二致、。訐英法，袒德國，蘇德關係之密切，呼應之緊湊，視德義二國之有同盟條約者爲尤甚：幾乎以撲滅英法爲快意，然自始助德作戰而迄今並不參戰，亦其國際政策之骨幹爲之限度而已。惟此骨幹，故於戰爭可息則息。及今不息戰，雖有控制芬蘭全境之可能，勢必與英法作正面之交綏；英法與德國之戰，孰勝孰敗，自爲蘇聯所極端關切，然與英法交綏而遂與德國爲伍，是蘇聯國策所不容。何况即此息戰，亦已有得。至於芬蘭，明知英法之爲之外援，可以一呼而得：與英法駢肩作戰，則不但有光復河山之可能，更有擴展疆域之希望；然及今不息戰，則全國淪爲英法與蘇德之戰塲，是爲勢所必至。爰挾英法慨許之厚援，洞察蘇聯不戰之國策，要以讓步，換取和平；割地矣，國族之獨立自由無恙也。兩國和戰之辨，擒縱之機、謂非若此者歟？</p>
<p>芬蘇媾和告成所予國際之影響，複雜而遠大，亦微妙至難於形容，將變化主難於把握。姑就光明之一面而槪述之：芬蘭可安喘息，此後以其優秀之民族，經營較小之天地，必有異樣光輝。蘇聯於和的收穫而外，自拔泥淖之中；自此擺脫戰時所最易遭受之脅誘，擺脫不堪容忍而戰時不得不容忍之要挾，得在國際保持自在之地位，活潑之機能。瑞典挪威二國，於禍迫眉睫之際，化險爲夷，如釋重負；而其對於英法德所取之中立政策，亦因威脅解除而較易保持。英法欣然於芬蘭獲得利平而未嘗淪爲蘇聯之附庸，此後在北歐方面之顧慮减輕，而對蘇聯修好之可能性則爲之增進。德國取得蘇聯經濟援助，有較大希望。波羅的海與北海之沿岸各小國，减少一方面之火藥氣息。美國之爲世界三組戰事而苦心孤詣以赴之者，此後得以業付三組之力量，較爲集中而對付兩組，其對付之力量及可能之功效，當然作反比例之遞加。中國與日本，直接無所得於彼方之和約，必間接獲益於蘇美！</p>
<h3>楊杰大使反渝談　蘇聯援華益將積極　認日蘇接近為不可能　列強對偽政權不重視</h3>
<p>昆明　據昨日行抵此間之中國駐蘇大使楊杰今日稱、蘇芬戰事停止之後、蘇聯對華援助必能更見增加、同時英法兩國對於在氏「新政府」之組織亦不感興趣、至於日蘇互訂不侵條約、此乃不可能者、一則諾蒙亨之停戰、乃爲日本敗北之結果、二則日方對蘇乃向無誠意者、（十三日合衆社電）</p>
<p>重慶　此間大公報載昆明專電稱、中國駐蘇大使楊杰將軍昨晨自蘇聯行抵昆明、接見新聞記者時發表言論、謂蘇芬戰爭將早日解決、其後蘇聯將增加其給予中國之援助、蘇日兩國並無重親可能、蘇英法二國對於在精衛之活動、不加重大注意、就歐戰而言、則戰事尙無早日結束之象、渠在蘇聯之工作頗可滿意云、按楊杰於本年初離莫斯科返國、途中曾遊歐洲數國、日內將自昆明飛渝向政府述職、然後赴故鄕雲南大理與家屬團叙、賀耀組將軍今在莫斯科、於楊杰離職期間代表中政府、（十三日路透社電）</p>
<h3>渝人士觀察歐局　認於中國有利　蘇聯將轉注意遠東　東報評論對蘇懷抱疑懼</h3>
<p>重慶　據此間政界今日稱、蘇芬戰事結束之後、蘇聯之注意又將轉向於遠東方面、以爲中國之助據稱、蘇聯對華之援助已達二十年、可謂歷史悠久、至外傳由蘇聯騰出西比利亞鐵路、供日本恢復其對歐之貿易、增强日本之經濟地位、同時與日本締結不侵條約、俾日本調其駐東北之軍隊至內蒙方面、攻擊其所助之政府、此爲不可設想之事、又據中國共產黨機關報「新華日報」稱、蘇聯之外交、完全以愛和平反侵略爲基礎、蘇聯和平政策之勝利、完全與全世界愛和平之民族利益相一致、蘇聯外交之另一要素、即爲對於爭求獨立之被侵略國家予以同情之援助、（十三日合衆電）</p>
<p>重慶　重慶華方人士接獲蘇芬和平的消息並不驚奇、惟情緒紛雜、一般華人均歡迎和約消息、因信蘇芬戰事之和平解決、將减少蘇聯牽入歐戰之危險，並將緩和蘇聯對西部前綫之掛慮、而能更注意於遠東大局也、就他方面論、聞和約條件頗關重要、苟條件不妨碍芬蘭之獨立與主權、則中國歡迎此約、但若條約意在使芬蘭屈服、則此間感覺焦慮、因恐此事爲他日創一危險之先例也、一般人除從有利中國方面解釋蘇芬局勢外、復稱蘇芬和平無他、唯蘇德外交之重要勝利而已、恐奧地利捷克波蘭及目理之芬蘭事件、將將使弱小國家懷疑協約國之保證、蓋協約國雖發彼等乃爲弱小國家與抵抗侵略而戰之保證與言論、但並不以有效之援助給予弱小國家也、（十三日路透電）</p>
<p>東京　「朝日新聞」載稱、日外務省官員對於蘇芬簽訂之和約、極爲重視、該的不僅將大有影響於斯堪的那維亞半島諸國之態度、且料將加强蘇德兩國對述東之政策云、又「日日新聞」以爲蘇聯今將在遠東採取更堅決之態度、關於此點、該報載稱、蘇聯近對日方解決與滿邊及堪察加海面漁權有關各懸案之癸力、表示曖昧之態度云、（十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>蘇聯引為滿意　芬蘭隱痛在心</h3>

<p>莫期科　此間政界人十對於蘇芬之締結和平條約至表滿意、力旨談判迅速結束、不　使兩國戰事宜吿中止、抑且使北歐和平　趨鞏固、政界人士指陳、蘇俄之條件異常寬大、因自戰事爆　之始、蘇俄即申明對芬幷無領土野心、僅欲保護生存攸關之利益、至於路萊里亞地峽方面、所以較去秋所提要求更進一步者、綠蘇聯二月以來、在該區以重大犧牲換取防務嚴密陣地之佔領、故其要求之擴大、乃必然之結果、其次蘇聯此次與芬蘭議和、證明蘇俄已放棄一九三　年十二月一日與所「人民政府」締結之條約、不再承認爲顧錫南爲芬蘭之國務總　矣、（十二日海通電）</p>
<p>芬京　芬京中立之政界人士認爲蘇芬和約之成立、乃蘇聯之擊敗英國、而芬蘭則爲英國之犧牲者、和約未經議會通過之前、尙未加以公佈、一般人民希望蘇俄勿堅持維堡之割讓、第一因該城爲芬蘭之第二大城、其次該城中心尙有芬軍繼續抗戰、軍界人士對於代表團之匆遽簽約、均表懊喪、據接近政府人士官稱、挪威丹麥、均曾以壓力加諸芬蘭、希望其簽訂和約、以免北歐戰事因英法之干涉而趨於擴大、蓋瑞丹兩國相信、倘英法以實力援芬、則德國必助蘇作戰、是則斯堪的那維亞均將捲入戰渦云、（十三日海通電）</p>
<p>芬京　芬京人士相信、蘇芬和約簽字之後芬蘭旣喪失喀萊里亞地峽、父租借漢戈半島、其結果芬蘭主權大受限制、因之逆料芬蘭前途異常慘淡、自一九三九年十一月三十日晨開戰以來、歷時一百零四日、芬方傷亡在五萬人以上、而物質上之破壞以及財政上之損失、更復恢復困難、使芬蘭今日地位、較之波羅的海各國史爲不逮云、（十三日海通電）</p>

<p>柏林　關於蘇芬兩國締結和約之消息此間人士極表歡迎、指陳英法兩國一再企圖使歐洲戰事擴大至斯堪的那維亞、是以雖至最後關頭、英法兩揆尙於前昨兩日發表援助芬蘭之申明意圖誘使芬蘭繼續抗戰此種企圖已經蘇芬昨晚之簽訂和約而使其完全失敗矣、柏林政界人士指陳、自蘇芬開始談判以還、英國報章即謂倘蘇芬議和成功、乃對英法之重大打擊、此語頗有自知之明、德國深表同意云、（十三日海通電）</p>
<p>羅馬　芬蘇兩國成立和約之後、此間一般人咸皆表示歡迎、蓋以就義國立塲而論　實不願見芬蘇兩國戰事擴大至斯堪的那維亞半島各國故也、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>巴黎　「秩序報」今日載文評論芬蘇和約、謂該約之結果、使芬蘭處於蘇聯勢力之下、而與前一八〇八年至一九一九年時相同、吾人對此之持久性、其能作任何幻想乎、協約國精神上之損失、猶較物質上之損失爲大、歐洲之小國今又將去其一矣、擁議民族自由者之勢力將因此受有影響、彼等所欲令中立國懷抱之信任、今將减小矣、（十三日路透社電）</p>

<h3>糧食　洋米上落頗迅速　崑錫暗盤五十元</h3>
<p>米市自前朝因爲孫總理逝世紀念日休業一天、昨則國米來源因由虹口區轉出者、有粳糯二千二百五十餘包、而塲外國米暗盤、初以成交較多、突然帶緊、惟結果仍以　　　懈、未有變化、踞守原盤、傳聞崑錫粳五十元、靑泗特薄四十八元、早晚稱四十六七元云云、糯米以近兩朝到貨轉多、故雖一般作客、有以其價盤較廉、頗見採辦、而售意尙鬆、行情平平、無所榮辱，</p>
<p>洋米此週內本屬步步下游、然昨晨曾以一般店家實胃、較有添辦、聞金價暴漲至五百元、與乎滙水縮短、人心突堅、原根客販悉不願輕脫、而浮囤散戶亦將手中各貨、一律執持不出、且有欲謀乘機拉進者、致喊聲逐起、形勢栗落異常、一反前之疲態、頓呈上風、一號西貢開四十四元半、若以休業前午後四十三元半價而論、巳漲一元、其他火紋開四十三半、小絞四十元、未有不好半元至元許者、當時趨勢似頗有轉機之希望、奈往日市面底脚已虛、人心終懷恐懼、而况銀根吃重、周轉維艱、與乎本月份大批期貨猶在繼續湧到、一般目光、都視此次好面、無非大跌小回、其大局已非金融之漲落所能挽同、所以乘高擋勢、無論原根客販及浮囤散戶不約而同、即相繼拋出、買戶心思除稍事添備外、無意多購、因之籌碼頓復充斥、乏人問津、市價立難維持、再度節節回降、結果午市收盤行情先緊後疲、適成平局、與前市各價相較、未見有所頡頏也、一號西貢爲四十四元、四十三元六角、二號西貢四十元特四十一元二角、火絞寳塔牌四十三元、四十二元半、雜牌四十二元二角牛、四十二元、小絞三十九元六角、三十九元、東京砶尖三十九元半、三十九元、二號暹羅三十九元半、混合碎三十五元半、三十五元、次至三十四元、粞二十一元半、三十一元、</p>
<p>洋米躉售晨間被滙水縮短之影響、期現各貨、售價一度拉起一二角、乃市面方見轉機、即有福家合義各洋行之手貨拋出、福家拋四月初一號西貢五百噸、價爲五十二元三角、合義四百噸祗五十二元、市乃立被挫落、回籠二號西貢初開四十八元六角至四十九元、小紋四十八元六八角至四十九元、後因洋商拋售、人心回軟、回籠期貨即乏受主矣、現洋米初漲後平、價與前日相似、惟成交則有七八千包云、</p>
<p>洋米昨日父有八千九百十一包到滬、係太古公司慶元輪自香港運來、昨晨七時許抵滬、停靠法租界本行碼頭起卸、（祖）</p>
<h3>回籠粉市步挺　麥價又到廿五元</h3>
<p>麵粉昨市勢步挺、査二號粉廠盤、在平賣期內、當然無所變動、惟限期亦祇有一星期、恐平賣至十九日期屆、勢必有漲價之動機也、目下市塲仍祇回籠紛聊以點綴、聞綠砲車因出口禁令撤銷、北帮繼在付裝、售盤又達十五元、老車牌亦以內地鄕莊去化尙佳、售四十四元五角半、後市聞標金猛漲、又加五分至角許、</p>
<p>小麥　昨市亦轉昂騰、因某厰進胃頗佳、又傳出口亦有問津、幫蘇州麥又到二十五元之價、蚌埠麥開至二十四元七角半、常麥二十四元五角、成交共有十五六車，</p>
<h3>紗花　買戶粉起　綿紗越漲越有勁　三月期雙馬做過九八七元半</h3>
<p>紗市猛進疾退、氣勢異常熱烈、此因外匯趨縮、人心鬨起、買者紛至沓來、所以市盤愈漲愈力、但華南方面實銷固較活動、惟採辦未見大量發展也、總之黃金飛騰、匯票縮昂、投機者當然拖進、情况不鬆矣、午後人心尤挺、三月份二十支雙馬曾做九百八十七元半、</p>
<p>現紗晨開因上日午後人心已好、於是買戶紛紛、二十支雙馬三月份開價　鬨曾達九百八十五元、此價一開、一般獲利乘機了結、檯面反見鬆弱、迅速回下至　百六十二元、迨至收盤、聞美匯大緊、買氣重振、漲風復起至九百六十九元、査半日間成交統計三千七百六十五包、行情二十支雙馬現貨漲十三元、今日有棉紗三十件運海防、一百件運海口、七十五件運廣州灣、四十件運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、同行　三、四一〇　香港　三四〇溫州　一五統計　三、七六五</p>
<h3>棉花廠辦已動　同行反覺沉悶</h3>
<p>本棉交易又形熱鬧、廠方需要起色、申新及裕豐日廠採辦、皆係三二支及六十支原料、新裕購買之棉、係二十支及卅二支原料、但同行交易轉趨沉悶、因印棉價格下跌、而換算價較廉、故心思平澹、惟美棉較緊、所以棉市情形父爲複雜也、棉市仍平穩、未見上升、蘇北來源、計通州一千二百六十二包、茲將現棉情形如左、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日晨初因利物浦來電之低落、及印度棉市之不振、故市價下落五六磅音、後稍見同業之購買、及一部份之空頭抵補而回漲、結果收盤價格、較之上日近漲十一磅音、遠期則漲起四五磅音、印度棉市昨日又降六羅比、預測回好二羅比餘、埃及跌十餘磅音、</p>
<h3>證劵　統丙進八元關　業廣股先漲後跌</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况在外匯大縮金子猛漲之高壓下、漸形支持不住、緩緩趨跌、多頭陣綫已有裂痕、尤以上午聯和號之賣出爲最湧旺、所幸公債不爲大資本家所注意、由來已久、故市塲尙無鉅大跌風、昨日上午聯和賣出最多、即丙種一項已有四十餘萬、同康亦出內入乙、同時協大久豐順康益昌鴻康潤利紛紛收買、或補空、或做多、但仍覺供　於求、市價緩緩疲落、午後聯和再賣、乙種鼎康同康均有供出、散戶多頭亦漸搖　、丙種八元行市乃吿破人、各項　隨勢而下、結果小去二角半至六角、成交約一百萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交中華書局股五十股、價卅二元正，　衆業公所股市仍甚黯淡、賣方並無壓力、價格亦無變更、祗業廣地產股由十五角四角漲達十六元半、蓋謠傳虹口區房屋即將增租也、惟因漲風太速、招致賣戶出籠、收盤反動回跌至十五元九角買進、十六元賣出、橡皮股被人忽視、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆銷路　油廠占四之三</h3>
<p>雜糧市塲、前日爲總理逝世紀念、循例休市一天、昨日照常開市、交易非常熱鬧黃豆銷塲更覺活潑、由榨油廠採辦者、達四分之三、餘爲本街南洋囤戶去路、各方熱烈拉抬、中次貨行情、昂騰元許、上身豆略緊五六角、統市做　蚌埠豆　車、價爲二十五元五角、桑園豆一百二十包、二十二元五角至一十一元、南京豆四車、二十五元至二十三元五角、次爲二十一元、蕪湖豆三車、二十五元五角至二十四元五角、丁家州豆六百餘包、二十六元五角至二十六元、揚州山豆二車、二十三元六角至二十三元、崇明沙黃六百餘包、二十五元二角全二十三元、平湖杜豆三百餘包、二十七元至二十四元、江北靑豆由廠囤本街等辦去七百包、價自二十元零六角步升至二十一元五角</p>

<h3>鹽塲滯銷</h3>
<p>淮岸未能全復，則運銷路少，鹽塲日積，愈久愈多。前奉淸査，近又於通泰各塲，綜核總數，截至本年四月底止，除運儲儀棧不計外，通屬淸査項下，計共存尖鹽十三萬八千零九十七桶，六分一釐。和鹽八千九百三十六桶，六分四釐。碱鹽二百四十三桶，八分。又續收項下，共存尖鹽五十三萬九千一百零五桶，六分二釐。和鹽六萬八千一百八十三桶，三分二釐。碱鹽六萬八千六百五十桶，六分九釐。泰屬淸査項下，共存尖鹽三十八萬一千五百六十五桶，三分四釐。和鹽二十四萬九千一百十二桶，三分九釐。碱鹽四百二十一桶，四釐。又續收項下，共存尖鹽八十二萬七千零十五桶，四分六釐八毫。和鹽六十一萬三千五百七十二桶，七分八釐。碱鹽八萬二千八百八百八桶，二分四釐二毫。又續收甫淋尖鹽共一千一百二十三桶，一分五釐。兩共存鹽一百九十六萬八千八百三十五桶，九釐。以三桶五分成引計之，將近九十萬引。以每年岸銷計之，將近三年，方可運竣；而三年之中，各塲新收，又復堆積，不免逐年加增，似此成本閣住，塲商日困，勢所不然。現聞部議，以複淮岸爲要務，而兩江制憲，亦復力爭，究不知川楚兩省，如何議覆，其於淮商，有無轉機，當視此一着也。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<p>小談</p>
<h3>文章的來源</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉音</p>
<p>據我看，文章的來源可分三類：第一種是身歷其境，親自觀察，或自己推想出來的結果，這是屬於創作一類的。</p>
<p>第二種是耳聞的筆錄，這沒有第一種那樣眞實與深刻，可是如果口述者的話可靠，而記錄者又有生花妙筆，那麼也不失其爲好文章。</p>
<p>第三種是參考各種書報雜誌的村料整理而成，是屬於編譯一類的。這種文章也需要相當的藝術修養與工夫，與抄襲是絕然不同的。</p>
<p>在以上三種中間，第一類的文字最可寳貴。不過要每個作家記者，都身歷其境然後再寫文章，那是不一定辦得到的。因此，外國報紙雜誌的特寫文章，多由以上三種來源採取。最合理想的當然是三種來源混合的總相，這種文章的內容最爲豐富，描寫最爲深刻，就是祇有兩種來源的，也已經不錯了。</p>
<p>今後自由談選用稿件的標準，也要嚴格地依據上列三種文章材料的來源走。我們希望每篇長短文章的作者，都會把材料的來源詳細註明，尤其是屬於編譯一類的，必須把原作者，出版處，出版日期等明白註出。認爲自由談是屬於讀者的，我們希望能給讀者以有意義有價値的精神糧食的保障。</p>
<p>抄襲舊報的稿件，千望莫來光顧！</p>
<h3>戰爭　歐洲各國的防毒運動</h3>
<p>— 卿</p>
<p>戰爭之神已將歐洲的人心完全陷入於毒瓦斯的恐怖中了，報紙上都用着觸目驚魄均巨字登載着什麽實騐室一裏正在加緊監製某種新奇而劇烈的毒瓦斯。各國的雜誌中，如倫敦的‘Abferver'巴黎的La　MATIN”都有着戰事辯論的文字：敵機的芥子氣炸彈是否能使全城窒息呢？抑或僅是軍火商推銷貨物而作的宜傳廣吿呢？還有如巴黎人忙碌地勘察氣化躱避所，倫敦人商議着避毒氣的野戰病院的建設等消息。的確，歐洲人在毒瓦斯威脅下惶恐得手足無措，入地無門了。</p>
<p>日內瓦的國際紅十字會除促使人民和政府注意預防毒瓦斯威脅外，最近復出版月刊，專刋載防毒運動的實施經過情形和結果。巴黎有無數家的店舖，把防毒面具陳列在大玻璃櫥窗中。在羅馬，有許多大百貨公司把一個套了奇異面具的假人放在櫉窗前面朝外注視着，像是在警告死神就要從犬空中墜下來。在倫敦，防毒面具的銷售數量是非常可驚的，通常每只約値美金十五元，但最近出品大增，供過於求，價格已跌到美金七元一只了。</p>
<p>德國正在訓練民衆，對各種毒氣的充分認識。白十字毒氣是一種「流淚瓦斯」，它能使人流淚，最厲害的可使人視覺全失，流血而死。綠十字和藍十字則是「種爛肺瓦斯」。在上述三種毒氣的散佈下，防毒面具僅足以保護人們的眼睛和呼吸系統的。還有一種黃十字或芥子液毒氣，除全身被用橡皮衣外，無物可以防禦，因它能穿過厚呢的制服，和皮膚，而深達身體的內部的。德國各大城市居民對於上述各項毒氣都有着豐富的常識，當局為使民衆離熟習起見，把盛着少量的四種毒氣的玻璃管裝箱出售，買客可將各玻璃管裝在一架玩具的大砲上，大砲施放後玻璃管內的毒氣隨即散發出來，市民借此可以辨別各類毒氣氣味不同的特徵的。</p>
<p>最近巴黎市上盛行着一種可搬運的「避毒所」，用金屬板圍成小亭，裏面裝有氧氣設備，全間可容十人，每間定價約爲美金九十五元左右，耐久可達八小時，當亭門關閉時。郊外營幕和地窖等，在巴黎有野戰醫院躱避處，可容市民約五百人。意國莫索里尼早已訂下宣戰時居民安全退避的計劃，並將其大綱印成小冊子在各地分發着。</p>
<p>對於保護市民，法國某將軍說：「我們固然不能使一個大都市的全體市民完全免於炸彈和毒氣的陷害，……但是在一千人中如能救得五個半，我們所盡的力量已算是得到報償了。」</p>
<p>歐洲各國，在今日，一面大量地加緊擴充製造殺人的利器，一面仍在作種種防毒的預防準備，戰爭殘酷歷史的重演，僅是遲早的事罷了。</p>

<h3>歐戰與犯罪　（上）　死刑死刑死刑——德國</h3>
<p>— 史弢</p>
<p>與德軍進擊波蘭同時，希特拉就向德國民衆下一個嚴重的警吿：「於前綫士兵將生命作孤注一擲鬥爭的當兒，國民若有利用戰事而冀圖自肥者，那就自趨死地！」德國的戰時刑法戰時經濟法和一般的戰時法令，都貫徹着這種精神；所以自從戰爭以來，德國人的日常生活似和死刑相接近起來了，例如去歲十月，有一個二十七歲的靑年，他利用了燈火管制的黑暗，盜取某女店員所放置收款的皮包，那時候，柏林特別法庭對於這少年下了死刑的判決，整個德國便爲此震驚不止：這判決是根據「國民生活侵害者」之法令的，該法令的第一項是「利用防空措置的犯罪」，規定利用燈火管制，而對於身體生命財產之犯罪者，均處極刑。因此那靑年就做了該項法令最初的適用者了。</p>
<p>法令雖然是如此森嚴，但此後報紙上每星期老有一次犯那法令的人被處死刑的消息。十一月二十七日，有個生於紐倫堡二十三歲的男子，要想偷取咖啡店女待者的錢袋，可是不幸得很，他最初小嘗試也失敗了，於是他便在絞首台上了結他的生命，判決的理由是：「任何職業婦女均有於燈火管制下的街頭安全返家之權利，爲確保黑暗街頭之安全計，被告雖係初犯，處以死刑亦屬適當。」</p>
<p>去年歲末，一個男子因爲在黑暗中對婦女實施暴行的緣故，終於由大審院以猥褻罪而處以死刑，對於縱火犯等更較平時要重罰得多了，有個名格拉伐的男子，爲了要詐取保險金，將自己的製粉間放火，庫中所存小麥隨着付於灰燼，後來這男子也同樣被處死刑，理由是：「被告將戰爭中德國國民生活上之必需品化爲烏有，損傷德國經濟之抗戰力，故被告實爲國民生活之侵害者，因而處以死刑。」</p>
<p>戰時的德國人，必須將國家的利益放在個人利害的前面，假如你折斷他人的手或足，那麽也會被處極刑，因爲這是損傷人力的資源，使德國抗戰力低下緣故；在經濟方面，誰都知道德國現正實行購物券制度，違反物價統制令的犯罪也是層出不窮的，例如在開戰之初，柏林有名的非爾士旦好飯店的主人，因爲違反戰時物價；提供饔食的緣故，被罰三十萬馬克，自從報紙發表了消息以後，全國的飮食業都不敢不服從統制了。其他揭發大量物價交易的事件眞是不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>開戰以來，巳有十多名德人犯了洩漏國家秘密的罪名，被處死刑，所以我們想像起來，在德國的間諜活動，一定是相當活潑的，至於反國社黨政治犯方面，則絕對不是局外人所能知悉的，就是在慕尼黑投彈要殺希特拉的犯人，到如今還是一些沒有下文。</p>

<h3>集美之雲　周碧初油畫風景觀感</h3>
<p>— 吳村</p>
<p>遠幾年前，我早就催促這位以擅作明朗風景畫藝的周碧初先生舉行個展，周先生老是謙虛的說：「再過一些時候吧。」迨周先生應福建省敎育廳的催請在閩開了一次展覽博得榮饗歸來，（一九三二年黃孟奎長敎廳時代）我又催他，他還是謙虛的說：「再過一些時候吧。」</p>
<p>去年秋天，我在周先生畫室裏看到他的傑作「集美之雲」，它的明朗，它的美麗，它的氣氛，在在使我感到周先生畫已到極高的成就了。集美是閩南唯一的學村，童年我曾在那邊受過敎育，村上的風景綫，永遠受人羨慕的。戰後，厦門淪陷，集美時時遭遇轟炸，學村已成一片焦土，集美的美之雲，已成彌漫的戰雲了，因之這幅傑作，更增了無上價値。</p>
<p>周先生的風景作品，很可與名震國際畫壇的周廷旭先生相伯仲，（很巧兩位周先生都是同鄕）我不懂繪畫，我只因自己所從業的電影和繪畫有關係，因而引起對繪畫有着濃厚的興趣，這次得先看到周先生的預展，同時又完成促催他舉行個展的願望，心裏非常喜慰，就拉雜的寫起這篇文來。</p>

<h3>天國的國民　（三）</h3>
<p>一個人不能因爲他的信仰就算天國國民。所謂天國，不但是信仰，也是行爲的規程。那個文士，知道他的神學，熟悉宗敎一切道理，能流利背誦守安息日，聖餐禮的律法，和祈禱的種種習慣及方法。他有一種有系統的信仰，能够記憶和背誦的，但耶穌却吿訴他，那不是宗敎的眞諦。因爲使人做基督徒的，不但是信仰心。一個人許如天使一般有信仰心，而同時又如魔鬼一般做人。他能知宗敎種種律法，和儀式，而同時缺乏淸潔思想和慷慨同情心。凡是這樣的人，他的宗敎，只爲一套與生活無關的道理，都是在天國領域之外的。我們要試騐人的信條，只要看他的生活，便得而知。相信一種信條，而對個人的尊榮，和社會的正義，却漢不關心，這是可能的。眞誠是一種美德，但徒有眞誠，也不能使人做天國國民，因爲眞誠，沒有寬容，理智，和慈善心，往往爲宗敎上的反面文章。一個人眞誠，我們許敬重他，但事實上，他的眞誠，決不能使他無過。耶穌被釘死十字架上，那些動手的人，無疑的在他們信仰上是眞誠的，然而。耶穌却爲他們禱吿，因爲他們眞誠，却是無知。眞誠而無知，便信仰變成頑固的剛愎。因爲牠只能使人然心，而不能使人無過。大數的掃羅，要殺害大馬色的基督徒，就他意念上說，他是絕對眞誠的，從那時起，千萬的人，因着那些眞誠而走錯路的吿發人，殺身成仁。所以，我們不可僅僅有眞誠，同時必須有開明的思想和慈善心。（待續）</p>

<p>該公司創辦時的資本，共五寓元，股東都是黑人，連裏面的編導人，攝影和佈景師等，一切都由黑人担任。黑人演員，是不喜歡余錢的，所以公司給他們的薪金，大都以家畜如牛羊等爲酬報。聘請一個主角，往往要以近百頭的牛或更多的羊作薪金。</p>
<p>第一張影片開攝後，曾轟動一時，黑人電影是空前的創舉，故某營業極盛。於是該公司增加資本，繼續攝製。但是在攝製一部，以夜間祭節禮爲背景的一片時，因光綫的太暗，更加上了主角的一副黑臉，攝成開映的時候，銀慕上演昌的而孔，都成了忽隱忽現的黑影，於是此片就無人觀看，公司也損失不少，該片的主角還要公司方面，賠償他的名譽損失。以後這個黑人影片公司，就不敢再攝製有夜景的影片了。</p>

<h3>Declaration of Peace Treaty: Finnish-Soviet Armistice Takes Effect Yesterday Afternoon; Finland Cedes All of Karelia to the Soviet Union; Hango Island Leased to the Soviet Union for 30 Years for Naval Base Construction; Arctic Petsamo Port Demilitarized</h3>
<p>London: Moscow radio confirms that the Soviet Union and Finland have concluded a peace treaty and that the armistice has taken effect this afternoon (i.e., 8:00 PM Shanghai time today). (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The terms of the Soviet-Finnish peace include the following five points: (1) The entire Karelian Isthmus, the entire shore of Lake Ladoga, the Fisherman's Peninsula, and part of eastern Finland are ceded to the Soviet Union. (2) Hango Island is leased to the Soviet Union as a naval base for a period of 30 years, with an annual rent of five million Finnish marks. (3) A railway will be built this year from the Kandalaksha naval base to Kemijärvi. (4) Troops will withdraw to the new border by 10:00 AM on March 15th. (5) The Petsamo area is a demilitarized zone. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Moscow: The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Republic of Finland have signed a peace treaty. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the Finnish organization jointly desire to end the war and establish peace relations. At the same time, they firmly believe that guaranteeing mutual security conditions (including the security of Leningrad, Murmansk, and the Murmansk Railway) fully aligns with the interests of both parties. Therefore, both parties deem it necessary to sign a peace treaty.</p>
<p>The Soviet and Finnish governments have appointed the following representatives: Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union; Zhdanov, Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet; Lieutenant General Vasilevsky; President Ryti of Finland; Minister without Portfolio Paasikivi; General Walden; and Professor Vuorma. (TASS, 13th)</p>
<p>Moscow: After 104 days of fighting between the Soviet Union and Finland, the territory Finland has agreed to cede is far greater than what the Soviet side demanded before the war. As for the Karelian Isthmus, it has now been entirely ceded to the Soviet Union. Vyborg, Finland's second-largest city (with a population of 74,000), is also included in the cession, which was not part of the demands last autumn. The old Finnish border was only twenty kilometers from Leningrad, but now it is one hundred and twenty kilometers away. Historically, the Karelian Isthmus, including Vyborg, once belonged to Russia, which is when Russian troops captured Vyborg in 1710. At that time, all of Finland belonged to Sweden. As for the Hango Peninsula, due to its strategic location, it is not only located at the northwest entrance of the Gulf of Finland, but also because it had a naval port built during the Imperial Russian era, it is sufficient to control the Gulf of Finland and affect Leningrad. Therefore, the Soviet Union demanded the construction of a military base on the peninsula, and this goal has also been achieved in this peace treaty. (Haitong Telegraph, 13th)</p>
<h3>Full Text of the Soviet-Finnish Peace Treaty</h3>
<p>Moscow: The contents of the Soviet-Finnish Peace Treaty are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) According to the procedures stipulated in the annex to this treaty, the Soviet Union and Finland shall immediately cease hostilities.</p>
<p>(2) The border between the Soviet Union and Finland will be established along the new boundary. According to this new boundary, the territory of the Soviet Union will include the entire Karelian Isthmus: the town of Vyborg, Vyborg Bay, the west and north shores of Lake Ladoga, Käkisalmi, Sortavala, the town of Suojärvi, some islands in the Gulf of Finland, the town of Koivisto in the Terijoki area, and some parts of the Rybachi and Sredny Peninsulas (the above sections are detailed in the attached map). The more detailed definition of the border will be determined by a mixed commission of signatories from both sides. This mixed commission must be established within ten days of the signing of the treaty.</p>
<p>(3) Both signatory countries must avoid mutual acts of aggression and must not ally or cooperate with countries that oppose either side.</p>
<p>(4) The Republic of Finland agrees to lease the Hango Peninsula to the Soviet Union for a period of 30 years, with the Soviet Union paying a rent of eight million Finnish marks per year. The leased territory includes the territory within five miles around the eastern and southern parts of the island and within three miles around the western and northern parts, as well as nearby islands (detailed in the attached map). The purpose of this lease is: (1) to establish a naval base to defend the entrance to the Gulf of Finland; (2) for the purpose of defending this base, the Soviet Union has the right to station the necessary naval, land, and air forces there. All expenses will still be borne by the Soviet Union. Within ten days of the treaty taking effect, the Finnish government must withdraw its troops from the Hango Peninsula and nearby islands and transfer jurisdiction there to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>(5) The Soviet Union agrees to withdraw its troops from Petsamo (which was voluntarily ceded to Finland by the Soviet Union under the 1920 Treaty). At the same time, in accordance with the 1920 Treaty, Finland must also avoid stationing armed vessels along the Arctic Ocean coast, except for those with a displacement of less than 100 tons. In addition, armed vessels under 400 tons may also be stationed there, but not exceeding 15 vessels. Also, in accordance with the same treaty, Finland may not station submarines and aircraft there, and may not establish military ports, naval bases, or naval repair facilities exceeding necessary needs along the coast there.</p>
<p>(6) In accordance with the 1920 Treaty, the Soviet Union and its people have the right to pass through Petsamo to and from Norway. At the same time, the Soviet Union may open a consulate in Petsamo. Transportation goods traveling to and from the Soviet Union and Norway via Petsamo shall not be subject to inspection and control, except for those that must be controlled under transportation regulations. Also, these transportation goods do not need to pay tariffs and other taxes. The management methods for the aforementioned transportation goods must comply with international practice. Also, Soviet citizens holding passports issued by Soviet agencies may freely travel to and from Norway and the Soviet Union via Petsamo. At the same time, Soviet civilian aircraft may cross Petsamo to and from the Soviet Union and Norway.</p>
<p>(7) The Finnish government grants the Soviet Union the right to transport goods between the Soviet Union and Sweden. To develop this cargo transport, both parties believe that it is necessary to build the shortest railway line. To the extent possible, both parties will build new railways on their respective territories this year, linking the towns of Kandalaksha and Kemijärvi.</p>
<p>(8) When this peace treaty takes effect, the economic relations between the signatory countries will be restored, and efforts will be made to continue to conclude trade agreements.</p>
<p>(9) This peace treaty shall take effect immediately after signing and shall be ratified by both parties. The procedures for exchanging ratification documents shall be held in Moscow within ten days.</p>
<p>This peace treaty has two original copies, each in Russian, Finnish, and Swedish. The date is March 12, 1940, and the location is Moscow. The signatories are Molotov, Zhdanov, Vasilevsky, Ryti, Paasikivi, Walden, and Vuorma. (TASS, 13th)</p>
<h3>Annex Contains Eight Items: Stipulates Procedures for Armistice and Troop Withdrawal</h3>
<p>Moscow: According to the annex to the Soviet-Finnish Peace Treaty of March 12, 1940, both parties have decided on the following procedures for armistice and troop withdrawal: (1) Both parties will cease hostilities at noon on March 13, 1940 (Leningrad time, 8:00 PM Shanghai time on March 13). (2) From the time of the armistice, a neutral zone (one kilometer wide) will be established between the advancing troops of both sides. Also, if the troops of one party discover that they have entered the territory of the other party under the new border principles on the first day, they must immediately withdraw one kilometer. (3) When the troops of one party withdraw from the new border, the troops of the other party will advance to the new border to take up positions. This withdrawal and advance procedure will begin at 10:00 AM on March 15, 1940, from the Gulf of Finland to the area of Riikisaari, and at 10:00 AM on March 16, 1940, north of Riikisaari. The daily withdrawal speed must not be less than seven kilometers, and the advancing troops and the withdrawing troops should maintain a distance of seven kilometers. (4) Regarding the withdrawal deadline, both parties, in accordance with Article 3 of the annex, stipulate as follows: (A) The withdrawal procedure for troops on both sides from the Taipaleenjoki River, Koivisto, and Taipale to the eastern shore of Lake Joukamojärvi shall be completed by 8:00 PM on March 20, 1940. (B) In the Ladva district of Kumunjoki, the troop withdrawal procedure shall be completed by 8:00 PM on March 22, 1940. (C) At the Logivaara, Värtsilä, and Matkaselkä stations, the troop withdrawal shall be completed by 8:00 PM on March 26, 1940. (D) In the area of Matkaselkä Station and Kolatselkä, the withdrawal procedure shall be completed by 8:00 PM on March 22 at noon. (E) From Kolatselkä to Ensi, the withdrawal procedure shall be completed by 8:00 PM on March 25. (F) From Ensi Station and Pietarin Island, the withdrawal procedure shall be completed by 8:00 PM on March 19. (5) The Red Army's withdrawal procedure from Petsamo shall be completed by April 10, 1940. (6) The commanders of both parties agree to take necessary steps in various cities and towns during the withdrawal to prevent the destruction of cities and buildings with defensive and economic characteristics (such as bridges, water gates, airfields, barracks, military depots, railway junctions, industrial facilities, telegraph and power plants). (7) All problems that occur in the transfer area (i.e., the areas stipulated in Article 6) shall be resolved by local representatives of both parties. In this regard, both command headquarters will appoint commissioners to monitor the main locations of troop movements. (8) After the cessation of hostilities, both parties will exchange prisoners of war in the shortest possible time. This procedure is based on a special agreement.</p>
<p>The signatories of the aforementioned annex are Molotov, Zhdanov, Vasilevsky, Ryti, Paasikivi, Walden, Vuono, and Vuorma. (TASS, 13th)</p>
<h3>Tanner Explains Reasons for Reconciliation; Finland Flies National Flag at Half-Mast in Mourning</h3>
<p>Helsinki: Finnish Foreign Minister Tanner recently gave a 20-minute radio broadcast, announcing that the Soviet-Finnish armistice agreement took effect at 10:00 AM this morning. At that time, all hostilities ended. Tanner also released an outline of the peace terms received by the Finnish government and said that these terms must be ratified by the Finnish Parliament. Tanner continued, "Finland is a small country. This war has been an unequal struggle from the beginning. We are not responsible for the war. We originally did not believe in the outbreak of war. When it could not be avoided, we were forced to fight for self-defense. Although we relied on the dedication of our officers and soldiers, we felt a lack of both manpower and materials. We have received overseas assistance, but it is still insufficient. Not long ago, Western powers proposed military assistance. After careful study by the Finnish military authorities, a weakness was discovered, namely, the problem of troop transport. The Scandinavian countries refused the requests of both Finland and the Western powers. As a result, Finland had to recognize that this assistance was unreliable. The Finnish government, in light of this, believed that it would be better to pursue peace before Finland was defended, so it signed a treaty last night. People will naturally have different opinions on this issue and will advocate continuing the war. However, at present, we must strive to build and consolidate peace and concentrate all our efforts on this task. We must forget the past and look to the future." Tanner continued, "The conditions proposed by the Soviet Union are not more severe than those proposed last autumn. Our representatives tried unsuccessfully to revise them. The Soviet Union did not put forward political conditions and did not interfere in our internal affairs. The People's Government has now shelved everything. The price of this peace is extremely high, which is why the government hesitated greatly to accept the terms." The above broadcast was the first Finnish confirmation of the peace news transmitted by Moscow. The people were silent when they heard the news, and many men and women shed tears. However, the Finnish people all seemed to have the idea that if the Finnish Army General Commander, Mannerheim, and the government decided to end the fighting, then continuing the war would be tantamount to suicide. After the news from Tanner, the flags on various military buildings were immediately flown at half-mast. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>Finland Loses Territory: 15,000 Square Miles</h3>
<p>Berlin: According to a Soviet official news agency report, the Moscow Communist Party organ Pravda published the contents of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty. Finland, according to the treaty, must cede approximately one-tenth of its territory, which is about 15,000 square miles, depending on how vast the strip of land ceded to the Soviet Union near Terijoki is, and how the boundary line from Sortavala to Porosozero is drawn. According to Pravda, the new Soviet-Finnish border line stipulated in the treaty starts from the Gulf of Finland about 30 miles west of Vyborg and runs roughly straight 15 miles north of Vyborg and about 15 miles north of Sortavala (Note: Sortavala is located on the northern shore of Lake Ladoga). Therefore, the railway line from Vyborg to Sortavala is still within the land that the Soviet Union should receive. The boundary line still trends northeast to the former border near the Soviet town of Porosozero. The former boundary to the Arctic Circle has not been changed. The Soviet Union obtained a narrow strip of land northeast of Rovaniemi within the Salla region, including the village of Kuolajärvi opposite the Soviet town of Kandalaksha. The Soviet Union also obtained the Rybachi (Fisherman's Peninsula) and the Sredny Peninsula in the Petsamo Bay in the far north. Except for changes that benefit the Finnish side, the new border is the same as the line drawn in the Treaty of Uusikaupunki in 1721. (Reuters, 13th)</p>

<h3>The Cause and Effect of the Restoration of Peace Between Finland and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>The cessation of hostilities and reconciliation between Finland and the Soviet Union was discussed by this newspaper yesterday as the key to whether the negotiations would succeed or fail, "the key to whether the European war would expand or not, and the key to whether the world situation would gradually stabilize or become more dangerous," and "We hope with utmost sincerity to achieve a satisfactory solution." However, just overnight, news came yesterday morning that the two sides had signed the agreement. An important link in international disputes has been resolved, and an abnormal extreme of human reason has been overcome. This is something to be gratifying about, something not encountered for a long time.</p>
<p>The Finnish-Soviet war broke out at the end of November last year. It lasted 104 days of bloody fighting until the signing of the agreement yesterday morning. Before the war, there were very long diplomatic negotiations between the two countries, and the contents of the negotiations and the truth of the breakdown were not made public. Summarizing what has been revealed by various parties, it is only known that the Soviet Union's demands on Finland at that time were very extravagant. The main terms of this peace agreement were informally released yesterday by the Soviet state-run TASS news agency. The situation of territorial transfers can be roughly seen, but the detailed boundaries need to be surveyed and determined by a mixed commission organized by both sides. Therefore, there is no formal data to make a practical comparison between the pre-war demands and the post-war compromise. However, the severity of the pre-war demands was to the extent that Finland would rather be destroyed than accept them, and thus waged a desperate battle. The extent of the current compromise plan is that Finland believes that it can maintain the independence and freedom of the nation, and thus sacrifices what can be sacrificed to stabilize the country. Thus, it can be inferred that what the Soviet Union sought and obtained was a concession compared to before the war. In addition to the territorial issue, the peace treaty has a clause of a political nature, that is, Article 3 stipulates that "Both signatory countries must avoid mutual acts of aggression and must not ally or cooperate with countries that oppose either side." This kind of mutual and passive restriction does not hinder Finland's sovereignty, nor does it hinder the Soviet Union's sovereignty, and it is a common clause in various non-aggression agreements in recent international relations.</p>
<p>If the peace treaty is like this, then the question will arise: Why did Finland and the Soviet Union go to war in the first place? Humans occasionally have times when reason is abnormal, and there are always things in the world that people regret doing. At that time and in that matter, people can only sigh and cannot answer why. This is not only the case with the Finnish-Soviet war. Forcibly trying to explain it and seeking an answer, it can be said that the Soviet Union did not fundamentally have a planned initiation of this hundred-day war; Finland's heroic act of going to death was a masterpiece. It is impossible to avoid being generous in going to death. The Soviet Union did not intend to go to war at first, but it still went to war, and it ended in peace despite its superior military power. Moreover, the compensation obtained after the war was not as severe as the demands made in the pre-war diplomatic negotiations. Therefore, the Moscow telegram yesterday stated: "This is a great proof of the Soviet government's commitment to peace." It cannot be regarded as exaggeration and hypocrisy, and I agree with it.</p>
<p>However, the current question is not why Finland and the Soviet Union went to war in the first place, but why they are now negotiating peace? Saying that the reason for going to war was the restoration of reason and the Soviet Union's commitment to peace seems correct, but it is insufficient. If the peace agreement had not been reached, or if the parties had not negotiated peace, there were two obvious possibilities for success: the Soviet Union, with its majestic power, could have taken advantage of the spring season to attack Finland. It would not have been an exaggeration to say that it would have been as easy as catching a rabbit. Destroying the reality and supporting a puppet government is something that the Soviet Union could have achieved through war, one. Finland could have asked for assistance from Britain and France, and Britain and France could have assisted Finland in resisting Russia. Finland had already obtained promises from Britain and France, and Britain and France had also expressed their readiness to depart with their troops. Thus, the two groups of wars in Europe would have merged into one. During the First European War, Belgium lost all of its territory, but was eventually able to stand tall after the war. Using that example, Finland could have achieved this through war, two. In the midst of artillery fire and flying flesh and blood, new and old feuds had almost become irreconcilable. If there had been no remaining strength, no future, and they had had to stop the war, it would have been understandable. Now, however, both sides have the possibility of continuing to fight and striving for final victory, but they have ended in peace. Shouldn't this be considered an anomaly in the wartime mass psychological state?</p>
<p>What goes on behind the scenes is something that we who are outside the situation cannot know. Looking back and forth, let's try to make an educated guess, and there are things that can be said: the Soviet Union's international policy is based on peaceful coexistence. Last year, it first sent troops to Poland, followed by sending troops to Finland. Although the reactions were very different, the original intention of sending troops was not to go to war, and there was absolutely no difference between the two. Criticizing Britain and France and siding with Germany, the close relationship and tight coordination between the Soviet Union and Germany was even greater than that of the countries with alliance treaties, such as Germany and Italy. It almost delighted in wiping out Britain and France, but it has not participated in the war from the beginning while helping Germany to fight. It is limited by the core of its international policy. Only because of this core can the war be stopped if it can be stopped. If the war is not stopped now, although there is the possibility of controlling the entire territory of Finland, it will inevitably confront Britain and France head-on. The Soviet Union is extremely concerned about who wins and who loses in the war between Britain and France and Germany, but confronting Britain and France and then siding with Germany is something that the Soviet Union's national policy does not allow. What's more, even if the war is stopped, there are already gains. As for Finland, it knows that Britain and France can be obtained with just one call, and that fighting side by side with Britain and France would not only have the possibility of recovering the lost territory, but also the hope of expanding its territory. However, if it does not stop the war now, the whole country will become a battlefield for the war between Britain and France and the Soviet Union and Germany, which is inevitable. Therefore, with the generous aid promised by Britain and France, it keenly perceived the Soviet Union's national policy of not going to war, and wanted to exchange peace for concessions. Territory was ceded, but the nation's independence and freedom were unharmed. Isn't this the strategy of the two countries' peace and war?</p>
<p>The international impact of the successful reconciliation between Finland and the Soviet Union is complex and far-reaching, and it is also subtle and difficult to describe. The changes will be difficult to grasp. Let's briefly describe it from the bright side: Finland can take a sigh of relief. In the future, with its excellent nation, it will manage a smaller world and will definitely have a different kind of brilliance. The Soviet Union, in addition to the gains from the peace agreement, has extricated itself from the quagmire. From now on, it will get rid of the coercion that is most easily suffered during wartime, and get rid of the intolerable demands that had to be tolerated during wartime, and will be able to maintain an independent position and a lively function in the international arena. Sweden and Norway, at a time when disaster was imminent, turned danger into safety and felt as if a heavy burden had been lifted. It will also be easier for them to maintain their neutral policies towards Britain, France, and Germany as the threat is lifted. Britain and France are pleased that Finland has obtained peace and has not become a vassal of the Soviet Union. In the future, their concerns in Northern Europe will be reduced, and the possibility of reconciliation with the Soviet Union will be increased. Germany has greater hope of obtaining Soviet economic assistance. The small countries along the Baltic Sea and the North Sea have reduced the atmosphere of gunpowder on one side. The United States, which has been painstakingly trying to deal with the three groups of wars in the world, will be able to concentrate the power it devotes to the three groups in the future and deal with two groups. The power and possible effectiveness of its efforts will of course increase in inverse proportion. China and Japan will not directly gain from the peace agreement in that region, but will indirectly benefit from the Soviet Union and the United States!</p>
<h3>Ambassador Yang Jie Returns to Chongqing; Soviet Aid to China Will Be More Active; Believes Soviet-Japanese Rapprochement Is Impossible; Powers Do Not Attach Importance to Puppet Regime</h3>
<p>Kunming: According to Yang Jie, the Chinese ambassador to the Soviet Union, who arrived here yesterday, after the cessation of hostilities between the Soviet Union and Finland, Soviet aid to China will definitely increase further. At the same time, Britain and France are not interested in the organization of Wang Jingwei's "new government." As for the Soviet Union and Japan concluding a non-aggression treaty, this is impossible because the ceasefire at Nomonhan was the result of Japan's defeat, and Japan has never been sincere towards the Soviet Union. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Ta Kung Pao here reported a special dispatch from Kunming saying that General Yang Jie, the Chinese ambassador to the Soviet Union, arrived in Kunming from the Soviet Union yesterday morning. When he met with reporters, he said that the Soviet-Finnish war would be resolved soon, and that the Soviet Union would increase its aid to China afterwards. There is no possibility of reconciliation between the Soviet Union and Japan. The Soviet Union, Britain, and France do not pay much attention to Wang Jingwei's activities. As far as the European war is concerned, there is no sign of an early end to the war. He was satisfied with his work in the Soviet Union. It is reported that Yang Jie left Moscow at the beginning of this year and returned to China. On the way, he visited several European countries. He will fly from Kunming to Chongqing to report to the government soon, and then go to his hometown of Dali, Yunnan, to reunite with his family. General He Yaodu is now in Moscow, representing the Chinese government during Yang Jie's absence. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>Chongqing Observers View the European Situation as Beneficial to China; Soviet Union to Shift Attention to the Far East; Eastern Newspaper Commentary Expresses Doubts Towards the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Chongqing – According to political circles here today, after the end of the Soviet-Finnish war, the Soviet Union's attention will shift to the Far East, presumably to aid China. It is claimed that Soviet assistance to China has lasted twenty years, which can be considered historically significant. As for rumors that the Soviet Union would vacate the Siberian Railway for Japan to restore its trade with Europe, enhance Japan's economic position, and simultaneously conclude a non-aggression treaty with Japan, allowing Japan to transfer its troops stationed in the Northeast to Inner Mongolia to attack the government it aids, this is considered unthinkable. Furthermore, according to the Chinese Communist Party's newspaper "Xinhua Daily," Soviet diplomacy is entirely based on love of peace and opposition to aggression. The victory of the Soviet Union's peaceful policy is entirely consistent with the interests of all peace-loving nations worldwide. Another element of Soviet diplomacy is its sympathetic assistance to invaded countries seeking independence. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Chongqing Chinese sources received the news of the Soviet-Finnish peace without surprise, but with mixed emotions. The general Chinese population welcomes the news of the peace agreement, believing that the peaceful resolution of the Soviet-Finnish war will reduce the risk of the Soviet Union being drawn into the European war and will alleviate the Soviet Union's concerns about the western front, allowing it to pay more attention to the overall situation in the Far East. On the other hand, it is heard that the terms of the peace agreement are quite important. If the terms do not hinder Finland's independence and sovereignty, then China welcomes the agreement. However, if the treaty aims to subjugate Finland, then there is a sense of anxiety here, fearing that this will set a dangerous precedent for the future. In addition to interpreting the Soviet-Finnish situation from a perspective favorable to China, it is also said that the Soviet-Finnish peace is nothing more than an important victory for Soviet-German diplomacy. It is feared that the events in Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and now Finland will make small countries doubt the guarantees of the Allied powers, as the Allied powers, although issuing guarantees and statements that they are fighting for small countries and resisting aggression, do not provide effective assistance to small countries. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The "Asahi Shimbun" reported that Japanese Foreign Ministry officials attach great importance to the Soviet-Finnish peace agreement. It is believed that it will not only have a significant impact on the attitude of the Scandinavian countries but is also expected to strengthen the policies of the Soviet Union and Germany towards the Far East. Furthermore, the "Nichinichi Shimbun" believes that the Soviet Union will now adopt a more resolute attitude in the Far East. In this regard, the newspaper reported that the Soviet Union recently expressed an ambiguous attitude towards Japan's efforts to resolve various pending issues related to the Manchurian border and fishing rights in the Kamchatka Sea. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Sees It as Satisfactory, Finland with Hidden Pain</h3>
<p>Moscow – The Communist Party's official mouthpiece, "Pravda," commented on the Soviet-Finnish peace agreement, saying that the Soviet Union's responsibility has been completed, and the security of the Soviet Union's northwest border and Leningrad has been guaranteed. Today, after the end of the war on the front lines, the Soviet people will feel very satisfied. This peace agreement has established permanent peaceful relations between the two countries. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Moscow – Political figures here are very satisfied with the conclusion of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty, aiming to quickly end the negotiations, not only to stop the war between the two countries but also to consolidate peace in Northern Europe. Political figures pointed out that the Soviet conditions were exceptionally generous because, since the beginning of the war, the Soviet Union had stated that it had no territorial ambitions towards Finland and only wanted to protect interests vital to its survival. As for the Karelian Isthmus, the reason for a more advanced request than that proposed last autumn is that since February, the Soviet Union has made significant sacrifices in the area to gain control of heavily fortified defensive positions, so the expansion of its demands is a natural result. Secondly, the Soviet Union's peace negotiations with Finland this time prove that the Soviet Union has abandoned the treaty concluded with the so-called "People's Government" on December 1, 193_, and no longer recognizes Kuusinen as the Head of State of Finland. (Haitong Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>Helsinki – Neutral political figures in Helsinki believe that the establishment of the Soviet-Finnish peace agreement is a defeat for Britain by the Soviet Union, and Finland is a sacrifice for Britain. Before the agreement is passed by parliament, it has not yet been made public. The general population hopes that the Soviet Union will not insist on the cession of Viipuri, firstly because the city is Finland's second-largest city, and secondly because Finnish troops are still continuing to resist in the center of the city. Military figures are disappointed with the delegation's hasty signing of the agreement. According to government sources, Norway and Denmark put pressure on Finland, hoping it would sign the agreement to prevent the war in Northern Europe from escalating due to British and French intervention. It is believed that if Britain and France provide Finland with substantial assistance, Germany will help the Soviet Union in the war, and then Scandinavia will be drawn into the war. (Haitong Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Helsinki – People in Helsinki believe that after the signing of the Soviet-Finnish peace agreement, Finland has lost the Karelian Isthmus and leased the Hanko Peninsula, and as a result, Finland's sovereignty has been greatly restricted. Therefore, the future of Finland is expected to be extremely bleak. Since the start of the war on the morning of November 30, 1939, it has lasted 104 days. Finnish casualties are over 50,000, and the material destruction and financial losses are even more difficult to recover, making Finland's position today inferior to that of the Baltic countries. (Haitong Telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>Berlin Excited, Rome Welcomes</h3>
<p>Amsterdam – According to Reuters, Berlin officials expressed excitement about the Soviet-Finnish agreement, as if Germany was celebrating its own victory. The "Rotterdamsch Nieuwsblad" correspondent in Berlin believes that in addition to the material benefits that Germany hopes to gain from the Soviet Union no longer being at war, the Soviet-Finnish compromise will further increase the Nazi government's authority and prestige at home. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Berlin – People here are very welcoming of the news of the conclusion of a peace agreement between the Soviet Union and Finland, pointing out that Britain and France have repeatedly attempted to expand the European war to Scandinavia. Therefore, even at the last moment, the British and French leaders issued statements of assistance to Finland in the past two days, intending to induce Finland to continue its resistance. This attempt has been completely thwarted by the signing of the Soviet-Finnish peace agreement last night. Political figures in Berlin pointed out that since the start of Soviet-Finnish negotiations, the British newspapers have said that if the Soviet-Finnish negotiations are successful, it will be a major blow to Britain and France. This remark shows self-awareness, and Germany deeply agrees. (Haitong Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Rome – After the establishment of a peace agreement between Finland and the Soviet Union, people here generally expressed welcome, because from the perspective of Italy's position, it really does not want to see the war between Finland and the Soviet Union expand to the Scandinavian countries. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<h3>Major Blow to the Prestige of Britain and France; The Moral Loss of the Allied Powers is Greater Than the Material Loss</h3>
<p>London – According to political observers here today, the conclusion of the Soviet-Finnish war is a major blow to the prestige of Britain and France. At the very least, the Nordic countries will now fall into the sphere of influence of the Soviet Union and Germany. At the same time, it will further weaken the position of Turkey and Romania. Finally, this move will greatly benefit Germany's wartime economy. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<p>Paris – "L'Ordre" published an article today commenting on the Soviet-Finnish peace agreement, saying that the result of the agreement is that Finland is under the influence of the Soviet Union, as it was from 1808 to 1919. Can we have any illusions about the durability of this? The moral loss of the Allied powers is greater than the material loss. Another small country in Europe will now be gone. The power of those who advocate national freedom will be affected by this. The trust that they want neutral countries to have will now be reduced. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>American Public Opinion Expresses Disappointment</h3>
<p>Washington – Congressional figures here today unanimously expressed disappointment with the terms of the Soviet-Finnish peace agreement. Democratic Senator Burke said, "These terms cannot be called a treaty, but only extortion." Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Republican Senator Vandenberg declined to comment, believing that it is necessary to conduct a detailed study of the peace treaty. Democrat Clark said that the Soviet-Finnish peace agreement is a matter for the Soviet Union and Finland and has nothing to do with us. Senator Norris believes that this is "a victory for Hitler, a defeat for Finland, a victory for dictatorships, and a defeat for democracy." Democrat Hittler said that all friends of Finland hope that Finland can effectively maintain its independence, but in fact, Finland's sacrifices can be said to be astonishing. (United Press, 12th)</p>

<h3>Finnish Parliament to Continue Meeting, to Make Final Decision on Peace Agreement; Current Cabinet to Tender Resignation</h3>
<p>Stockholm – According to news received here, the Finnish Parliament debated the Soviet peace conditions until 3:00 a.m. It is heard that a closed-door meeting will continue to be held today. Finland's final decision on the peace conditions may be announced today. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Helsinki – Political figures here predict that the cabinet led by Prime Minister Ryti will tender its resignation in the near future. If the Finnish cabinet resigns before approving the Soviet-Finnish peace agreement, it is feared that a provisional cabinet will be formed to restore diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Rumors are circulating that a key military figure will serve as the new Prime Minister. (Haitong Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Paris – According to a telegram from Helsinki, Finnish Minister of War Niukkanen and Minister of Education Hannula have both resigned because they do not approve of the signing of the Soviet-Finnish agreement. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>Finnish Soldiers Pledge to Defend the Country to the Death; Fierce Battle in Viipuri, Houses Reduced to Ruins</h3>
<p>London – Finland broadcast in Russian last night, saying that the Finnish army will defend the independence of the country, stand firm and fight to the end. All soldiers are prepared to defend their country with their last drop of blood. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Stockholm – There was a fierce battle in the outer suburbs of Viipuri last night, and houses were reduced to ruins. Finnish soldiers were still holding their ground in the trenches, using fierce machine-gun fire to attack the Soviet army. Large and small artillery shells fell one after another, and the whole town was on fire. The Finns did not extinguish it. Often, when the Soviet army advanced, the Finnish soldiers made a strategic retreat, defending new lines of defense, so that the Soviet army paid a heavy price for every inch of ground gained.

<h3>Severe Disaster in Hebei Province</h3>
<p>Beiping – According to news from central Hebei, the famine in Hebei Province has become a reality, and the people have now reached the point of starvation. It is heard that some people are eating tree bark, and some are even eating soil to fill their hunger, resulting in many deaths. There is no food available, and many farmers are pulling up wheat stalks to eat, so there is no hope for the spring harvest. The situation is particularly bad in the Baoding area. It has now been ascertained that the entire area between Baoding and Tianjin is desolate. Last year's floods have not receded to this day, and residents have no food to store. Before September of this year, they will have to find a way to escape the famine. However, the food stored elsewhere has either been taken by the guerrillas or confiscated by the Japanese army, so there is a severe shortage of food among the people, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious. It is estimated that there are about 3 million famine victims in Hebei Province who are crying out for food after last year's floods, and there are also 1 million in Shandong Province. The number of devastated rural areas is about 12,500 in Hebei Province and about 5,000 in Shandong Province. This situation will become increasingly difficult to deal with in the future, and it is feared that it will be unimaginable by spring, as food becomes scarcer and the number of victims increases. Even in Beiping alone, the poor have now reduced their daily meals from three to one. (Reuters, 13th)</p>

<h3>The Premier's Great Contributions: Soviet Newspapers Unanimously Praise Him; His Testament Has Become the Banner of the War of Liberation; Striving to Lead China onto the Path of Victory</h3>
<p>Moscow – On the 15th anniversary of the passing of the Chinese leader, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, Soviet newspapers unanimously published articles detailing Dr. Sun's contributions to China. Pravda stated, "The great Chinese figure, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, dedicated his life to the struggle for the liberation of the Chinese nation, breaking the feudalistic shackles imposed on the Chinese people by imperialism. In 1925-27, the reactionary petty bourgeoisie of China violated Dr. Sun's testament and deviated from his path of struggle. As a result, China's national crisis deepened and faced the threat of Japanese imperialism.</p>
<p>This lesson has united honest and patriotic elements in China, forming a solid united front against Japan. The Chinese political parties, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, have joined hands to advance together, aiming to realize Dr. Sun's Three Principles of the People. Dr. Sun's testament has now become the banner for the Chinese people's great war of liberation against Japanese imperialism, and also the standard for the Chinese people's efforts in construction.</p>
<p>Under this banner, the Chinese people have fought against the Japanese invaders for two and a half years. This struggle has led China onto the path of final victory, completely freeing itself from the shackles of imperialism.</p>
<p>Shameless traitors attempt to lead the Chinese people to violate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's testament. These despicable collaborators shamelessly invoke Dr. Sun's name, attempting to deceive the people in order to achieve their shameless goals. The greatest enemies of China, the greatest enemies of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, will surely be defeated by the entire Chinese people and Dr. Sun's loyal comrades. The great Dr. Sun Yat-sen belongs to the Chinese people, and China will always be loyal to Dr. Sun's testament and strive to realize it." (TASS dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3>U.S. House Passes the Vinson Naval Expansion Act; Stipulates the Addition of 43 New Warships and 1,011 Military Aircraft</h3>
<p>Washington – Yesterday, the House of Representatives passed a resolution to appropriate $655,000,000 to expand the U.S. Navy and Air Force within two years. Opposition was minimal. The bill has now been sent to the Senate. The bill stipulates the addition of 21 new warships, 22 auxiliary ships, and 1,011 military aircraft. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Washington – Yesterday, the United States House of Representatives passed the unprecedented Vinson Naval Expansion Act, totaling $966,772,878. Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee and drafter of the Vinson Naval Expansion Act, Vinson, stated during the debate on the naval expansion bill, "We want to make it clear to the European countries that our country can use force when necessary. This is the cheapest price to guarantee our country's peace and security. Our primary duty is to have a navy sufficient to protect the United States." Republican Congressman Fish opposed the bill, stating, "Our current navy already makes our country very safe." The naval expansion bill stipulates the construction of 12 new warships, including 2 super battleships of 45,000 tons, 352 new naval aircraft, and $22,553,250 for naval aircraft and munitions. The bill also designates funds to maintain a strength of 150,000 naval officers and sailors and 25,000 Marines. The bill is $111,699,699 less than what President Roosevelt proposed, a reduction of approximately 10 percent. The Navy Department indicated that it would submit a supplementary bill of $100,000,000 before the end of the year to restore the original proposal. The Navy Department also stated that regardless of whether Congress appropriates funds, the department will proceed with the Guam development plan, which requires $4,000,000. The Navy Department has placed Guam under the jurisdiction of the 14th Naval District, using part of the Hawaiian Naval District's budget to develop Guam. The Navy Department does not intend to withdraw the U.S. fleet from the Pacific to the Atlantic or the western coast of the United States. (United Press dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>British Under-Secretary Declares That He Deeply Feels the Importance of Aiding China; Will Do His Best to Fulfill the Obligations of the Alliance; Loans to China Appear to Be Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>London – During today's House of Commons session, a member asked whether it was true that a credit line of £3,000,000 had been lent to China by Britain last summer and had not been fully used, and whether there were other ways to help China. Under-Secretary Butler replied that the British government fully realized the importance of helping China. As for the availability of the £3,000,000 credit line, he believed there was no doubt. The British government was well aware of its obligations under the alliance and was doing its best to fulfill them in difficult circumstances. Another member asked whether he had noted that the U.S. Export-Import Bank had recently decided to provide a loan of $20,000,000 to China. Butler replied that these negotiations appeared to be underway. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>British and French Prime Ministers Report on the Progress of Aid to Finland; French Chamber of Deputies Postpones Discussion</h3>
<p>London – This afternoon, Prime Minister Chamberlain presented the Finnish situation in the House of Commons. Soviet Ambassador Maisky also listened in the diplomatic gallery. The Prime Minister declared that the Finnish Foreign Minister had informed the British Minister to Finland this morning that the terms of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty had been signed in Moscow last night, and that the Finnish and Soviet armies had ceased fire at 11:00 a.m. today (Finnish time). Throughout the Soviet-Finnish war, the British government had, together with the French government, supplied Finland with a large amount of war materials and various military supplies (applause). The British government had indeed expressed its willingness to provide the Finnish people with all possible assistance to resist aggression heroically (great applause). I told the House on Monday that we were prepared to provide Finland with all the resources at our disposal, once we knew that this action was in accordance with the wishes of the Finnish government. As for deciding on the course of action most beneficial to Finland in light of all the facts, this should be done by the Finnish government. This is what we should understand. Whatever the Finnish government decides, the British people wish to unite to express sympathy for their situation and admiration for their perseverance and bravery in fighting against overwhelming odds. This can be a consolation to the Finnish people. These heroic facts will be forever remembered in Finnish history and will long remain in the minds of all nations. After the Prime Minister finished his speech, opposition leader Attlee rose and said, "We all admire Finland's struggle. We are relieved that the slaughter has ended, but we cannot help but regret the victory of the aggressor (great applause). Britain should now provide Finland with all possible assistance to help it recover from the wounds caused by this unprovoked attack." (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>London – Conservative Member of Parliament Macmillan requested that the House of Commons hold a secret session to discuss the government's handling of the Finnish issue in recent months. Chamberlain refused. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Paris – During the afternoon session of the Chamber of Deputies today, Premier Daladier delivered a speech requesting a postponement of the discussion on the Finnish issue. He said, "Since the outbreak of hostilities between Finland and the Soviet Union, France has continuously assisted Finland without interruption. It ranks first among the countries that have provided Finland with military equipment. Detailed figures have been published. Recently, at Finland's request, we provided the country with the latest type of bomber." Our Minister to Finland transmitted a telegram from Finnish Foreign Minister Tanner, expressing gratitude for our country's decision to provide unconditional assistance to Finland. This is clear evidence. "However, merely providing military equipment is not enough to save Finland from its crisis. Therefore, the Supreme National Defense Council decided on the 3rd of last month to send troops to assist in the war. By the 26th of last month, our expeditionary force had been fully equipped and was ready to move out at any time, with many ships waiting in the major ports along the Atlantic Ocean and the English Channel. At the same time, the British government made similar efforts, constantly negotiating with neutral friendly countries diplomatically to ensure that these troops could reach Finland smoothly. However, this assistance could not be provided unless Finland requested it, and up to this point, Finland has not directly and publicly requested it from Britain and France. The reason why we must wait for that country to make a request is that Sweden and Norway have consistently opposed British and French troops passing through their countries. We want to respect international law even during wartime, as can be seen in this example (applause from the members). In short, although our country is prepared to send 50,000 troops to Finland to assist in the war, this must be with the consent of the countries responsible for transportation. There is no doubt. I sent a letter to Finnish Minister Holma on the 7th of this month, in which the key points were, 'Our country has been waiting for your country's call for help for many days,' and informed him of Sweden's pressure on that country. Although we have heard about it, we would still like to reiterate that France is prepared to assist Finland immediately. Our expeditionary force is already fully equipped and ready to go." He also stated that Finnish Foreign Minister Tanner had promised to give our country a concrete reply as soon as the Finnish Parliament held a meeting today. Therefore, I propose that the Chamber of Deputies should postpone the discussion of the Finnish issue." After the Premier finished his speech, the Chamber of Deputies decided to adopt the Premier's opinion and postpone the discussion of this issue until the 19th of this month.

<h3>Stanley Reports in the House of Commons That the British Army Is Being Organized; The Security and Integrity of Britain and France Are Intrinsically Linked; Equipped on a Continental Scale, It Is Extremely Appropriate</h3>
<p>London – When Secretary of State for War Stanley presented the army budget in the House of Commons today, he said that it would be neither appropriate nor desirable for him to predict, as his predecessors had done in peacetime, what kind of tasks the British army would perform in the future. Whatever tasks the army may be asked to perform in the future, the army has not yet undergone the same trials as the navy and air force. Stanley looked back at the views on the continental army, which had previously met with fierce opposition in the country, and then said that the nature of the Munich Agreement seemed to indicate that although war was not absolutely inevitable, it was approaching, and that if war did come, its nature would be what it would be. It is obvious that if war breaks out, Britain must fight side by side with France for freedom and justice, so the security of France is linked to the security and integrity of Britain. If so, then Britain's security will depend on France's security. Therefore, Britain's manpower and great industrial strength must be used to organize an army on a scale sufficient to guarantee our security and worthy of being in the position of a major power. Stanley continued to mention the decision made last year to equip the army on a continental scale, and the British expeditionary force is now in France. No one has heard that this decision was inappropriate. Initially, the military strength was not strong, but now it is rapidly becoming stronger. A large army is currently being organized. We can now assume a larger part of all the war burdens of France, and France initially bears a heavier burden. We must know that although the general decision on British rearmament began in 1936, the army, equipped with all kinds of new weapons and ammunition necessary for modern warfare, only existed one year ago, according to the previous scale. The British army in France is continuing to expand. The number of British troops in France today is about twice as many as in October, and the number continues to increase every day. He had recently visited France, and at that time the British army had gained six or seven weeks of experience in the ice and snow. He inspected along the British army's defensive line and was surprised by the reality that the British army had become and would present. After he returned home, the weather turned better. He knew that in recent weeks, the British army's positions had become increasingly fortified. When he inspected the troops, he saw an atmosphere of practical work and confidence in victory throughout the army, and the relationship between Britain and France was closer in this war than it had been in the last war. In the last war, Britain and France were allies, but in this war, Britain and France are close friends. The British Dominions and India and the colonies have successively given Britain very valuable assistance, for which the people of the country are deeply grateful. The Canadian army has been training in Britain for nearly three months and is gradually completing its training. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>London – The House of Commons met this afternoon to discuss the army budget for the next year and immediately passed it unanimously.

<h3>Simon's Speech: Peace Must Include the Restoration of Freedom to Czechoslovakia and Poland</h3>
<p>London – Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon delivered a speech at a luncheon at the National Liberal Club today, advising the people of the country not to waste energy discussing detailed peace plans and new systems for the international community before the main foundations necessary for a new Europe had been laid. For if the power of the Nazis is not effectively restrained, the free people of Europe will have no future to speak of. Peace must include the restoration of freedom to the people of Czechoslovakia and Poland, but the most difficult and most important condition is that it must be guaranteed that there will be no more Nazi aggression in the future. Verbal recognition of this will be difficult to believe, because Hitler has repeatedly broken his word in the past. This situation has made even the most moderate among us believe that as long as Hitler and his confidants hold power, any valuable solution will be difficult to achieve. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>German-Italian Talks: Wide-Ranging, of Great Political Significance, Italian-Soviet Relations May Improve</h3>
<p>Berlin – German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop returned here last night after concluding his visit to Rome. After getting out of the car, he immediately paid a visit to Führer Hitler to report on the progress of the Rome talks. (Haitong dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Rome – Based on the observations of Roman political figures and the press, the scope of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's discussions during this visit was wider than the scope of the two official newspaper articles released the other night.

Although the specific content is unknown, it can be certainly concluded that Ribbentrop's visit had great political significance. According to newspaper commentary, the talks between the German and Italian foreign ministers revealed that at least the following two results were achieved: (1) Italian-Soviet relations will see great progress due to Germany's mediation; (2) Germany and Italy have reached complete agreement on the Balkan issue.

<h3>Soviet Government Achieves Diplomatic Success; Molotov's Birthday; Chongqing Newspaper Praises Him in Article</h3>
<p>Chongqing – The "Xinhua Daily" recently published a lengthy article on the 50th birthday of Soviet People's Commissar and Foreign Minister Molotov, praising the success of Soviet diplomacy. It is claimed that the results of Soviet diplomacy in the past two years are threefold: (1) preventing the spread of the imperialist war to the Soviet Union; (2) ensuring the security of the Baltic coastal states; (3) ensuring peace in Southeastern Europe. The conclusion of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact has destroyed the hope of the enemy imperialist powers to turn Germany against the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's conclusion of mutual assistance treaties with Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Finland (with the People's Government) ensures the security of the Baltic coast, while the conclusion of a commercial treaty with Bulgaria guarantees peace in Southeastern Europe.

<h3>Speculating on the Price of Essential Goods: Authorities to Prosecute According to Law; Municipal Chamber of Commerce Ordered to Find Ways to Suppress Prices; Stabilization Committee to Formulate Specific Measures; Rumor that Two Concessions May Negotiate Cooperation Methods with the Japanese</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 13th), the Public Works Department issued a notice stating: "Notice is hereby given: Recently, certain individuals within the Public Concession have been hoarding, monopolizing, speculating, and profiting from food and other essential goods, causing the current selling price of some of these items to be very high, which hinders the maintenance of public order and good governance in the Shanghai Public Concession. Therefore, it is hereby announced that anyone who commits the aforementioned acts will be prosecuted according to law. This notice is hereby given."</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Ordered to Suppress Speculation</p>
<p>In view of the soaring prices affecting people's livelihoods, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in addition to issuing orders to various guilds to find ways to suppress and crack down on speculation and hoarding of goods, has reportedly received an order from the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department to find ways to suppress the prices of daily necessities for the people in order to maintain people's livelihoods. As for the staff of various trade guilds, such as secretaries, clerks, accountants, general affairs officers, and other staff, who are also salary earners, their lives are inevitably difficult at this time of high prices. Therefore, the responsible personnel of various industries are advised to provide appropriate subsidies within their means to provide relief and stabilize their livelihoods.</p>
<p>Working Methods of the French Concession Stabilization Committee</p>
<p>The Rice, Coal, and Retail Market Investigation Subcommittees established by the French Concession Public Works Bureau Price Stabilization Committee have been working actively since their establishment and have achieved considerable success. According to a committee member, the work of the three subcommittees involves listening to information from the French Police Department and various parties, and conducting thorough investigations into the industries under the jurisdiction of each subcommittee. Currently, this work has come to a preliminary conclusion. According to the results of the investigation, we are gradually able to understand the inside story of this price increase. We will formulate specific measures and submit them to the authorities to suppress prices, etc.</p>
<p>The Subcommittee held a meeting yesterday to report on the findings of each group's investigation, in order to discuss how to prepare a report on specific measures to suppress prices and future directions for investigation work. The meeting was held after 5:00 PM yesterday at the French Public Works Bureau. In addition to the foreign members of the subcommittee, Chinese members Yao Zhongba, Jin Zhixuan, Lu Gaoyi, and Wan Modong also participated.</p>
<p>Foreigners Express Opinions</p>
<p>According to foreign sources, the Price Stabilization Committees of the Public Concession and the French Concession may begin negotiations with the Japanese in the near future to request full cooperation from the Japanese side. It is observed that prices in this city will be difficult to fall unless various restrictions and taxes imposed by the Japanese are removed. Taking rice as an example, the efforts of the Stabilization Committee to restrict hoarding and speculation in the concession area may be effective in lowering the price of rice. However, if the Japanese do not allow the inland rice to come to Shanghai, its price will still be unable to continue to fall due to the insufficient supply. Therefore, according to foreign critics, the fact that the Price Stabilization Committees of the two concessions can see this point and implement direct negotiations with the Japanese can be called a "fundamental solution."</p>
<h3>American Judge Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Morning; Enjoyed His Trip to the Mainland; Heard Cases in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press", American Judge Helmick of the U.S. Court for China returned to Shanghai on the French mail ship "Xiafei" on the 13th after visiting Chongqing. He was accompanied by his wife and Collin, the clerk of the U.S. Court. According to Judge Helmick, his trip to China's wartime capital was not an "official mission" but was purely for his vacation and to take the opportunity to travel to the mainland with U.S. Ambassador Johnson and others. He enjoyed the trip very much and visited unfamiliar places, seeing and hearing a lot. After arriving in Hanoi, he traveled by car to Kunming, and then followed the newly opened road to Chongqing. This journey took about five and a half days, without any danger or accidents along the way. He only stayed in Chongqing for a few days. On the way back to Shanghai, he temporarily opened a court in Guangzhou to hear cases involving American citizens.</p>
<h3>The Public Works Department's Surtax Case; Strong Opposition from All Parties; Taxpayers' Association Will Make a More Solemn Representation; Hoping the Bureau Will Tighten its Belt and Abandon the Surtax</h3>
<p>Since the Public Works Department of the Public Concession announced its intention to increase the general municipal surtax, special house surtax, and land surtax surcharge by 50% again from July 1 this year, Chinese and foreign taxpayers have taken a clear stance of opposition, believing that it is impossible to increase the burden again during this extraordinary period of soaring prices. The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession has already sent a letter to the Public Works Department at the joint request of the Federation of Citizens of the First Special District and the Citizens' Sub-Associations of various districts, asking them to consider the situation and stop before it is too late. It is learned that the association is closely watching the development of this surtax case and will make a more solemn and firm representation through the Taxpayers' Representative Conference. Currently, all parties in the concession, both Chinese and foreign, hope that the Public Works Department can consider austerity, tighten expenses as much as possible, and abandon the proposed surcharge, so that the outwardly prosperous market can overcome the difficulties.</p>
<h3>Bureau's Explanation of Staff Salaries</h3>
<p>A director of the Public Works Department once proposed to the Bureau that in the future, the salaries and retirement allowances paid to the Bureau's employees should be paid in national currency. The Board of Directors of the Bureau has agreed to the above proposal, except for special positions that cannot be hired without paying foreign currency. This very special situation will be considered by the Personnel Committee. Some people outside have misunderstood this matter, and a statement is hereby made to eliminate it. It has been pointed out by the outside world that the Bureau pays its employees in gold pounds, but this is not true. Only one of the Bureau's foreign employees receives a salary in foreign currency, and the rest are paid in national currency. The basic salaries of these employees were converted into national currency when the exchange rate was one shilling, one pence and seven-eighths in 1937. Since then, due to the high cost of living, some allowances have been given to compensate. For Grade A employees (there are actually 163 employees in this category with varying levels in each department, not the very small number that the outside world claims), when the exchange rate fell to six pence, an allowance of 73.24% of their basic salary was added. After that, the exchange rate continued to fall, but the Bureau did not add any allowances. As for Grade B and L employees, a cost-of-living allowance of 40% of their salaries was added. All of the aforementioned temporary allowances were determined by an independent subcommittee after research. The members of the subcommittee were all businessmen of different nationalities, and the report was approved by the annual meeting of the Taxpayers' Association. In addition, the Bureau deducted 5% of their salaries and paid another 10% as savings. Due to the decline in the exchange rate, the value of this savings has also been reduced. According to the recent instructions, the reduction in losses will be borne by the employees by 57% and by the Bureau by 43%. Furthermore, the basic salaries of these employees were previously converted into national currency at the rate of one shilling, two pence and seven-eighths. Later, the exchange rate plummeted, and the Bureau, out of consideration, had guaranteed the exchange rate at one shilling when employees completed their term and withdrew their savings, starting in 1928. As for American and Japanese employees, they were also paid at the same exchange rate, but it was later stipulated that this guaranteed exchange rate would be reduced to eight pence. The majority of the outside world criticizes the Bureau's total expenditure, most of which is used for the salaries of Chinese and foreign employees, but this is also not true. The Bureau's total expenditure on salaries accounts for about 48%, and the Police Department accounts for about half of 48%. This expenditure on police expenses can be called huge compared with other places. At present, the Bureau has a total of 1,348 foreign employees, excluding the Russian detachment of the Volunteer Corps. Their distribution is as follows: (1) Volunteer Corps (excluding the Russian detachment) 10 people, (2) Fire Brigade 40 people, (3) Police Department 858 people, (4) Public Works Department 89 people, (5) Health Department 129 people, (6) Education Department 82 people, (7) Finance Department 15 people, (8) Tax Collection Section 43 people, (9) General Office 22 people, (10) Industrial Section 4 people, (11) Legal Department 2 people, (12) Library 1 person, (13) Chinese Department 4 people, (14) Music Band 48 people. From this point of view, those who want to criticize the Bureau should first consider the above numbers, and if the security provided by foreign employees is greatly reduced, the impact will be not insignificant, and should be noted as well.</p>
<h3>Rotation of Low-Priced Rice Shops; Temporarily Suspended for Five Days Starting Today; Continued from the 19th of This Month; Foreign Rice Arriving in Shanghai Has Exceeded One Million Piculs</h3>
<p>The sale of low-priced Saigon broken rice in this city will be temporarily suspended for five days starting today. The Shanghai Low-Priced Rice Committee issued its fourth notice yesterday, stating, "The second phase of low-priced rice sales is scheduled for 20 days, starting on February 23 and ending on March 13. From the 14th, rice sales will be suspended for five days to change the location of the low-priced rice distribution points and handle the handover. The second phase will resume on March 19. This notice is hereby given." The Public Works Department Police also issued a notice yesterday stating, "The Shanghai Low-Priced Rice Committee has chosen to suspend low-priced rice sales from March 14 to March 18, 1940, due to the selection of low-priced rice shops. The address of the new low-priced distribution point (ticket sales and rice distribution address) will be announced separately. In addition to posting the above two notices, each low-priced rice shop will also post a notice stating 'Low-priced rice has not arrived, tickets will be sold when rice arrives.'" According to a member of the Rice Shop Guild, in addition to the 30,000 bags of tribute rice sold in the first phase, more than 20,000 bags of the 40,000 bags of tribute rice scheduled for the second phase have been sold as of March 13, and the remaining amount can be sold out before April 7. The second phase of low-priced rice work is currently being actively prepared.</p>
<p>Although Gold Prices Rise, the Rice Market Remains Stable</p>
<p>Also, after the opening of the rice shop and tea house markets yesterday, rice prices tended to fall due to the sale of hoarding households. However, due to the sharp rise in gold prices, there was no major decline. According to reliable sources in the rice industry, since the beginning of the lunar new year, the total amount of foreign rice ordered by rice merchants that has arrived in Shanghai has exceeded one million piculs, and as foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai, rice warehouses are already unable to accommodate it.</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Foreign Rice to Arrive Today</p>
<p>The arrival of foreign rice is reported in this newspaper repeatedly. Yesterday and the day before yesterday, another 18,000 bags arrived. The Taikoo Company's Taiyuan Wheel brought 4,347 bags from Haiphong and 5,310 bags from Hong Kong. It arrived in Shanghai at noon the day before yesterday (the 11th) and has been unloaded. Yesterday morning, the company's Qingyuan Wheel arrived in port, also bringing 8,911 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and docked at the company's wharf in the French Concession for unloading. It is reported that a French wheel will arrive in Shanghai today, with a large quantity of foreign rice directly shipped from Saigon.</p>
<h3>Tramcars to Operate in the North District of Suzhou Creek; Negotiations Progressing Well</h3>
<p>Since the Suzhou Creek North District tram service agreement was signed by Director-General Ke Lin and Japanese Consul-General Miura at the Japanese Consulate on Seymour Road, rumors have been spreading that the tram service will resume soon. These rumors are rampant, but authoritative sources have not confirmed them. According to sources from the tram company, negotiations to restore tram service north of Suzhou Creek have made good progress. Mr. Ivan, the general manager of the tram company, has hinted that the tram service may be restored in the near future, or within the next week. The negotiations are being conducted directly between the Shanghai Tramway Company and the Japanese authorities, with the British consulates acting as intermediaries. The exact date of operation has not been announced.</p>
<h3>USS Guam to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow</h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, the USS Guam, a gunboat of the U.S. Yangtze River Fleet, is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 15th from Wuhu. The USS Luzon is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Wuhu on the 18th. In addition, it is reported that the U.S. cruisers USS Augusta and USS Marblehead will come to Shanghai next month and then sail to Qingdao and Yantai. It is expected that Rear Admiral Glassford, commander of the U.S. Yangtze River Fleet, will remain in Shanghai.</p>
<p>New Subsidiary Coins Have Not Been Shipped to Shanghai; Rumors of Large Shipments Being Delivered Are Inaccurate; However, They Can Still Be Used If They Enter Circulation</p>
<p>In view of the fact that subsidiary coins are the medium for small transactions and are in great demand by the people, the Ministry of Finance has revised the Subsidiary Coin Regulations in order to maintain the circulation of subsidiary coins and eliminate the illegal profits sought by unscrupulous people. The Ministry has ordered the Central Mint to mint new one-cent, two-cent, five-cent, and ten-cent subsidiary coins, which have been minted and will be issued and circulated by the Central Bank. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has also been ordered by the Ministry to inform all trade associations and merchants. It is reported that the new subsidiary coins will be issued in the mainland first, and will not be shipped to Shanghai for the time being. However, those that enter Shanghai in circulation can still be used. The number of ten-cent and five-cent coins that can be accepted is limited to 20 yuan in legal tender each time, and the number of two-cent and one-cent coins that can be accepted is limited to 5 yuan in legal tender each time. However, this restriction does not apply to the receipt of taxes and the exchange of currency by the Central Bank. The rumor that a large number of coins have been shipped to Shanghai is inaccurate. It is reported that the design is slightly the same as the previous one, but the model is smaller.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Photos; The Investigation Is A Fake Product</p>
<p>The other day after the subsidiary coins came to Shanghai, a press agency dispatched so called 'Subsidiary Coins' and dispatched the photos to different presses. At that time, this newspaper was thoroughly examining the photos and one side said 'one corner/dime' and there was a picture of an ancient coin. The other side was in English and the words were as such: Loanedror Prizeonlv 1939 and its meaning was for a prize. So it's deduced that this drawing is not the new subsidiary coin because it's a token from a slot machine/coin machine. Because the picture was published by another newspaper, the readers keep asking this newspaper, so record the truth to dispel doubts.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ships Competing for the Yangjiadu Wharf in Pudong Are Blocked; Rowing Gangs Block the Wharf; The Japanese Ferry Company Fails</h3>
<p>The ferry business on both sides of the Huangpu River has been controlled by the Japanese Shanghai Ferry Company since the war. The company has expanded its business lines one after another, with a total of eight lines. Yesterday, it tried to open a new ferry line from Yangjiadu in Pudong to the Great Pier in Nanshi, seizing the livelihood of the original private ferries. The boatmen resisted for their livelihood, and the Japanese ferry's attempt to launch its first maiden voyage was blocked. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Pre-War Ferries Were Seized</p>
<p>Before the war, the Shanghai Olympic Trust Company's Huangpu River ferries had six large ferries (numbers one to six) and eight small ferries (numbers eleven to eighteen), a total of fourteen ferries. All were seized by the Japanese and, except for one that had its machinery dismantled, the rest fell into the hands of the Japanese Shanghai Ferry Company. The profits made from operating the ferries on the other side of the Huangpu River were even greater than before the war. The so-called "Public Works Bureau" had asked the Japanese to hand over the ferries last year based on "city-run reasons", but after many negotiations, they were rejected.</p>
<p>Annual Profit of More Than 700,000 Yuan</p>
<p>At present, the Shanghai Ferry Company operates a total of eight cross-river ferry lines, including (1) Shanghai (Beijing Road Pier) to Gaoqiao, (2) Shanghai to Donggou, (3) Shanghai to Gaomiao, (4) Shanghai to Xidu, (5) Shanghai to Qichangzhan, (6) Shanghai to Nanmatou, (7) Shanghai to Zhoujiadu, (8) Nanshi Nanmatou to Zhoujiadu. The daily profit is about 2,000 yuan in gold, the average monthly profit is 60,000 yuan, and the annual profit is more than 700,000 yuan, which is an astonishing amount.</p>
<p>New Ferry Line; Competing for Private Ferries</p>
<p>In order to control the entire ferry industry, the company recently planned to open a new ferry line from Yangjiadu in Pudong to the Great Pier in Nanshi, which was scheduled to have its first trial voyage yesterday. The operating hours were from 7:00 am to 4:30 pm, and the one-way fare was set at 5 cents per passenger. A small ferry, the "Xidu Maru", was sent out to make its maiden voyage from the Great Pier in Nanshi to Yangjiadu to pick up passengers.</p>
<p>Large Numbers of Rowing Boats Block the Wharf</p>
<p>The Yangjiadu Wharf in Pudong was originally designated as a cordon by the Japanese. After it was opened on January 15, there were 50 or 60 rowing boats carrying passengers between the Great Pier in Nanshi. Recently, seeing that the Shanghai Ferry Company had scheduled to open a ferry yesterday, competing for their livelihood, they united dozens of rowing boats yesterday morning, mooring around the Yangjiadu Wharf, tying them together with ropes, blocking the ferry from docking, and preparing more than 100 thugs on the wharf to destroy the ferry. At 7:10 am, the Xidu Maru arrived in Pudong. The boatmen responded to the call, armed with bamboo poles, preparing to use force. The crew of the Xidu Maru, fearing that the hull would be damaged, immediately sped away. As of yesterday afternoon, the ferry had not resumed operation. It is unknown whether it will be able to reopen today.</p>
<h3>Strictly Prevent the Shipment and Reprinting of Substitute Coupons for Subsidiary Coins in Eastern Zhejiang</h3>
<p>The chambers of commerce in various parts of eastern Zhejiang have printed and issued substitute coupons in order to facilitate trade and exchange, as the market is extremely short of corner notes and small change. It has been learned that the chambers of commerce have limited the use of these substitute coupons to the counties, fearing that unscrupulous people will inevitably carry them out of the country and reprint them privately in Shanghai, and then transport them to Ningbo to use them in an attempt to pass them off as real. They have sent a letter to the Customs Superintendent of the Zhejiang Customs, ordering their subordinates to pay attention and strictly prohibit the smuggling of these circulating coupons out of the country, and to strictly prevent counterfeit coupons from entering the country, in order to prevent financial disruption.</p>
<h3>No Results Yet in Negotiations on the Details of the "Police Agreement"; Authorities Say It Is Difficult to Predict When It Will End; Many Outstanding Issues Remain</h3>
<p>According to foreign sources, the Public Works Department Police told reporters yesterday that there is currently no possibility of implementing the police agreement on road construction beyond the boundary signed by the Public Works Department and the puppet "Mayor" Chuan Xiaoyan, as no results have yet been achieved on the various details of the agreement. What can be told to you at present is only that the principles are being discussed, but no specific details have been reached. The truth is not allowed to be disclosed, and it is difficult to predict when the negotiations will end. It is said that although the agreement on police matters relating to the construction of roads beyond the boundary was signed by both parties on February 16, many outstanding issues remain to be resolved.</p>

<h3>Post Office Opens Military Yen Drafts for the Japanese Army; Creates a Bad Precedent in the History of Postal Money Orders; Original Tickets Are Sealed and Mailed, Similar to Insurance Letters; The Outside World Has Criticisms of the Post Office's Measures</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration's acquiescence to the Japanese demand that the public be allowed to use Japanese military yen to issue drafts to Hankou and Jiujiang has attracted great attention from the outside world. The following is a continuation of the situation:</p>
<p>The outside world criticizes the Shanghai Postal Administration for unilaterally agreeing to the Japanese demand that Japanese military yen be used to issue drafts to Hankou and Jiujiang. Because this matter was not reported to the General Administration for approval, the outside world is criticizing the Shanghai postal authorities for compromising and seeking completeness.</p>
<p>Development in the Suburbs of Shanghai</p>
<p>Although the issuance of the above drafts is still limited to the occupied areas, and the branches in the concession do not follow suit, the suburban post offices in Shanghai such as Henglu in Hongkou, Huajin Road in Nanshi, Laoximen, and Lanidu in Pudong all follow suit.</p>
<p>Designated Amount of Remittance</p>
<p>The locations for exchanging remittances of Japanese military yen are still limited to the post offices in Hankou and Jiujiang. Other occupied areas do not follow suit. According to the Datong News Agency, the amount of military yen that can be remitted is limited to 200 yuan in Hankou and 50 yuan in Jiujiang.</p>
<p>Sealing and Mailing Method</p>
<p>Finally, according to the Datong News Agency, the method of mailing the above Japanese military yen is to seal and mail the original tickets. This method was previously only used for insurance letters, and the remittance following this method is a bad precedent in the history of postal money orders, not only violating postal regulations.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Reach Record High; Strict Sanctions Being Prepared; Deposits, Mortgages, and Exchanges Are Not Allowed; Conversion of Legal Tender Is Underway</h3>
<p>Since the end of the war, financial institutions have concentrated in Shanghai. The government has management measures for gold, and private buying and selling are absolutely prohibited. However, Shanghai's black market for gold reached a new record high yesterday. The morning closing price was 4,982 yuan, and the afternoon closing price was 4,995 yuan, once exceeding the 5,000 yuan mark. The price posted by silver shops has reached 5,005 yuan. The local banks and money houses have stopped accepting gold deposits and mortgages in view of national policies. However, pawnshops and silver shops have not stopped the business of gold deposits, mortgages, and exchanges. Silver and money houses that have complied with the regulations are proceeding with the procedure of exchanging gold deposits for legal tender at the legal price. The authorities are paying close attention to other pawnshops and silver shops that have not complied, and will negotiate strict sanctions to correct the law as soon as the necessary preparations are completed.</p>

<h3>Great Shanghai Gambling Den in the City：Fake Police Raid Gambling,恒安 Gambling Den's Thugs Cause Trouble, Japanese Troops Arrive to Suppress and Round Up Everything, Nanyang Bridge Iron Gate Once Closed</h3>
<p>The Great Shanghai Club gambling den, located at the Houjiabangkou of Fuyou Road, near the City God Temple in the city, is grand in scale and exquisitely decorated. Inside, it is equipped with all kinds of gambling tools, such as dice games, big and small tables, and Pai Gow. It also has opium couches and employs young women to entertain and serve attentively. Therefore, residents inside the city generally enjoy frequenting it. Unexpectedly, yesterday afternoon around 4 o'clock, while the gamblers were in high spirits, Wen Zhenya, the head of the fake police substation of the City God Temple, leading dozens of fake police officers, armed, rushed to surround and arrest them. They arrested over sixty gamblers and male and female employees on the spot, tied them up with ropes, and took them to the fake substation for investigation. It was also learned that at around 9 a.m. yesterday, two Japanese suddenly broke into the Heng'an Company gambling den in Heng'an Lane, near Nanyang Bridge on Fangbang Road. The gamblers inside were all frightened and dispersed. At that time, the Japanese fired a shot from a handgun, fortunately without hurting anyone. The gambling den then announced its closure.</p>
<p>Zhang Mengsheng, a former detective with a limp, came forward to open the Heng'an Company fake government gambling den at No. 24, Heng'an Lane, near Nanyang Bridge. Because he relied on strong backing, he had earned a huge sum of tens of thousands of gold since its opening, which aroused the jealousy of others in the same industry. A gangster named Yang Abing also opened the Huasheng gambling den at No. 44 in the same area, intending to compete. Unexpectedly, at 12:30 p.m. yesterday, more than ten armed gangsters suddenly demanded protection money from Yang. The two sides disagreed and</p>
<p>a conflict broke out. At that time, someone shouted that guerrillas were attacking the gambling den, which made the situation even more chaotic. The Nanshi Miura Military Police Headquarters was originally stationed at Nanyang Bridge, and the Qizhou Road detachment was nearby. Upon receiving the news, they immediately telegraphed for a large team of Japanese military police to rush to the scene and surround the two gambling dens. The situation was tense. Because the doors and windows of the gambling dens were closed, the Japanese military police fired five or six shots as a warning before they were able to rush in, arresting a total of more than 140 people, including dealers, lookouts, tea servers, and gamblers. They also seized a Mauser pistol inside the den. At the same time, the French Concession police authorities also ordered</p>
<p>Chinese and French police to implement security and temporarily closed the iron gate to traffic. Yang Kufsky, a French Russian detective who was proficient in Japanese, inquired about the incident. Afterwards, Zhang Mengsheng, the limping man who came forward for the Heng'an gambling den, and the old man Li Xiaobao appeared and, through strong connections, offered a large sum of money to have the arrested members of the den released first, in order to resume gambling immediately.</p>
<h3>Selling Counterfeit Money: Two Criminals Arrested Awaiting Investigation</h3>
<p>Lang Guangchun, a Chinese detective of the Lao Zha station, and detective Chen Dianwen, investigated the sale of counterfeit Chinese, Jiaotong, Peasant, and Central banknotes. They arrested Han Yu'an, a Yangzhou native, in front of No. 18, Lafayette Road in the French Concession, and seized counterfeit Jiaotong Bank five-yuan notes worth 200 yuan. After interrogation, they went to No. 18, Lafayette Road in the French Concession and arrested Lu A'gen, a Chongming native, and seized counterfeit Jiaotong Bank five-yuan notes, one counterfeit Chinese Bank five-yuan note, one counterfeit Peasant Bank five-yuan note, and four counterfeit Central Bank one-yuan notes. They were all taken back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer, Ru Bao'yi, requested permission to reschedule the hearing because it was still necessary to investigate and crack down on the counterfeiting organization. After questioning by Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court, the two defendants were ordered to be detained and the hearing was rescheduled for one week.</p>
<h3>Public Bus No. 2 Almost Robbed, Speeded Away, Luckily No One Injured by Gunfire</h3>
<p>Near Anhe Temple Road on Columbia Road in the western part of Shanghai, around 8:18 p.m. last night, a Public Bus No. 2, numbered 15124, sped past. Unexpectedly, three thugs, all armed with handguns, were lying in wait on the side of the road. They immediately ordered the bus to stop, intending to board and rob it. Fortunately, the driver was alert and sped straight ahead. The thugs fired a shot, but fortunately no one was injured. The thugs then fled. Although the passengers in the bus were not robbed, they were thoroughly frightened.</p>

<h3>Accidental Discharge of Handgun Kills Table Leg Support. Accounting Officer of Xilai Men Gambling Den Causes Disaster While Cleaning Gun</h3>
<p>Shao Senquan, a 55-year-old native of Hangzhou, worked as a table leg support in the Xilai Men gambling den on the west side of the Daxi Road Difeng Road in the Shanghai West Beyond Concession Road area. On the night of the 7th of this month, Shao was serving in the den. At 11:30 p.m. that night, Niu Naizhang, the 41-year-old accountant of the gambling den, a native of Chongming, was wiping his handgun in the den. Unexpectedly, there was still a bullet left in the gun chamber, which had not been ejected, causing him to accidentally touch the trigger. The bullet flew out. At that time, Shao happened to be nearby and could not avoid it. He was shot in the right lower abdomen above the greater trochanter, fell to the ground wounded. Niu was shocked and at a loss after causing the disaster. The head shareholder and manager of the gambling den, Zhang Dimei, sent his partner Lu Quangen to hire a car to take Shao to the Yongchuan Hospital at the intersection of Maigao Baolu Road and Xiafei Road in the French Concession for treatment. However, because the injury was too severe, the treatment was ineffective, and he died at 5 p.m. on the 10th of this month. The hospital reported to the French police as usual. It was found that the deceased had a concubine living in a bungalow without a number in the Luxi House in Caojiadu. However, although the hospital notified the concubine of the accident, she did not arrive at the scene. The corpse was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for an autopsy. Yesterday, the police reported to the Second Special District Court, which appointed a prosecutor to come to the funeral home at noon to verify that the deceased, Shao Senquan, died from a gunshot wound. Because no family members of the deceased came forward, the court ordered the corpse to be handed over to the funeral home for burial, pending identification by relatives.</p>
<h3>Social Miscellany</h3>
<p>Chen Renhao, a Ningbo native who worked as a clerk in the Banking Department (35 years old, residing at No. 78, Lane 36, Maitehesi Road), was found by the bank to have forged signatures to withdraw 17,000 yuan in cash.

Unexpectedly, Zhu did not repent of his past mistakes after being released and used the name of the Qunying New Drama Company to solicit donations from the West Patrol of the Public Works Department. He was arrested and brought to the Second Special District Court yesterday. Judge Qiu presided over the court and, after a brief interrogation, ordered him to be detained for retrial on the 19th of this month.</p>

<p>Liu Wangshi, a 30-year-old woman from Zhenjiang, whose husband ran a cigarette factory, developed an addiction to gambling, which led to her abandonment by her husband and her subsequent wandering life. At 6 p.m. on the 2nd of this month, she snatched a felt hat from Ke Enqing, a Ningbo native and assistant detective of the French police station No. 210, in front of the Gongwu Theatre on Edward Road. She was caught on the spot by Ke and escorted to the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Minsheng concluded the trial and sentenced Liu Wangshi to six months' imprisonment as a warning.</p>
<p>The French Police Department mobilized a large team of police officers in trucks at 5 p.m. the night before and went to the Huagen Road area, from the eastern end of the intersection of Dashijie Mintini Road to Luzon Road.

<p>The houses in the Taiyuanfang area at the corner of Baliao Bridge Street and Edward Road in the French Concession are the property of a Chinese man named Zhu. At the beginning of last month, the tenants of the houses received a notice from the rental agency stating that the rent would be increased by 40% across the board from February 1. The tenants were alarmed and unanimously stated that they had installed water meters since April of last year and were responsible for the water bills, which had resulted in considerable losses. If the rent were to be increased by a large amount again, they would not be able to afford it and had already sent a letter of rejection.</p>
<p>The Gordon Road Police Station received a report from an informant at 5 p.m. the day before yesterday that a gang of thieves was planning to rob pedestrians on Xiaoshadu Road near Kangnaowan Road.

<p>Chen Deming, the manager of the Zhendong Flower Factory in Jiru Lane, Jixiang Street, French Concession, ordered 8,205 yuan worth of cotton from the Qiaxing Flower Factory in the name of the factory, all of which were paid with checks. When the Qiaxing Flower Factory went to cash them, they were all returned due to insufficient funds. Tang Huquan, the owner of Qiaxing, hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, accusing Chen Deming of issuing bad checks. Judge Zhu Chuzhe concluded the trial and sentenced Chen Deming to a fine of 2,000 yuan. If he chose to perform labor service instead, it would be calculated proportionally based on the number of days in six months, and he should also return the 8,205 yuan to the plaintiff.</p>

<h3>Medical Doctor Tang Europe Returns to China</h3>

<h3>Finance: Thinking of the Soviet-Finnish Armistice and the Western Front War, British-American Exchange Rates Have Shrunk Sharply for Days, Affecting the Shanghai Market, Fortunately, the British Exchange Rate Remains at the Original Price</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions were affected by the further sharp drop of eight and a half points in British-American exchange rates overseas. Therefore, the HSBC listing in Shanghai reappeared at a small 1875, totaling 6 yuan 25. Exchange rates of Dutch, Luxembourg, and Japanese currencies also shrank, while other exchange rates such as the British exchange rate remained stable. As for the half-large inner market situation, although there is talk of a peaceful resolution between the Soviet and Finnish sides in the European situation, the world observes that the Western Front war has the potential to become fierce. In other words, it is unfavorable for Britain and France. Although the British-American exchange rate has plummeted by a large amount of 1 jiao 6 fen 375 in the past five days, most local speculators still look at the small side. Therefore, there are still quite a few who are adding to the British-American exchange rate. However, HSBC is absorbing when it sees it cheap, but it has not given up on maintaining the price of 4 shillings 1 and 25. Therefore, the market situation still remains hidden. The morning opening continued to report British stability and American tightness, priced at 4 shillings 1 and 25 and 6 yuan 46875. Later, there was a slight吐 from Hong Kong telegrams, and foreign firms Hua Bi, etc. also had卖胃, so the market situation suddenly turned hard. HSBC bought in the cheapest British gold at 4 shillings 1 and 5625, and the American exchange rate also rose to 6 and a half yuan. Later, although Sassoon and Huashang successively扒进 April 美滙, Huahang still had卖胃, and a certain foreign firm was also willing to supply, so it was once stable. Unexpectedly, as the market was about to close, rumors suddenly spread on the market that HSBC had stopped maintaining the rate. Therefore, a few speculators began to move indiscriminately, and a certain Huahang also came to buy 期 美滙. At that time, a certain American firm took the opportunity to buy British and sell American, and HSBC吐 out a lot against 4 shillings 1 and 25. Therefore, until the close of the market, British gold was still able to stand firm at 4 shillings 1 and 25, and the American exchange rate was only告 6 yuan 4375 (equivalent to the British-American exchange rate already making a small amount of 3 yuan 7 jiao 4 fen and 5 li and a half). As a result, compared to the previous day, the British were flat and the Americans were tight by 1 and 5625, and the potential of futures and spot goods were seen to be pulled apart again.</p>
<p>HSBC's supply is still not weak</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London big条, recent issues fell by 25, and remote issues shrank by 1875. New York silver prices remained flat, London raw gold remained stagnant, and British exchange rates against American, Shanghai, French and other exchange rates were all flat. American暴落 by 8 and a half points against British, dropped by 1 jiao against Shanghai, and was small by 4 fen and 875 against French.

Banks opened in the morning and sold spot goods for 4 shillings 1 and 25 for British, and 6 yuan 46875 for American, compared to the previous closing, the British were flat and the American was tight by 125, due to the continued drop in exchange rates. At the same time, futures opened, the British were flat and the Americans were soft by 15625. After the opening, Hua Bi came to sell first, followed by Hong Kong telegrams also塞出, and the market situation suddenly became hardened. Hua Bi sold to HSBC this month's British gold for 4 shillings 1 and 40625, and Hong Kong telegrams sold to HSBC spot British gold for 4 shillings 1 and 5625. At that time, spot British gold at 4 shillings 1 and 40625 and American exchange rates at 6 and a half yuan could be settled. HSBC's listing was announced, British was flat and American缩 by 1875, and the silver equalization tax was褐晓, falling by 1 and a half points. After this, Huahang Shanghai sold to a certain firm this month's American exchange rate for 6 and a half yuan. Later, Sassoon suddenly came to buy Dutch April 美滙 for 6 yuan 375. At the same time, speculators also came to buy at higher prices, but supply and demand remained flat, and the situation was very stable. Unexpectedly, after 11:30, rumors suddenly spread in the market that HSBC had given up on maintaining the British gold price of 4 shillings 1 and 25. Therefore, the扒风 started again, and the state suddenly告转紧. A certain Huahang结入 同行 Dongya April 美滙 for 6 yuan 375, and Huashang扒进 a certain firm's April 美滙 for 6 yuan 375 and 3125. A certain 同行转扒进 HSBC spot British gold for 4 shillings 1 and 25. Until the close of the market, British gold was 4 shillings 1 and 25, and the American exchange rate was 6 yuan 4375.

<h3>Under Heavy Absorption, Gold Reaches Unprecedented High Price – $5,052 –</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash gold market surged, rising rapidly and endlessly, breaking the previous high record of $4,915 on the 16th of last month. It soared past the $5,000 mark, reaching an unprecedented peak of $5,052. However, many holders took profits, leading to some resistance to the price advance. Nevertheless, the market still rose by over $100. The reason for today's surge is rumored to be "the clandestine massive absorption by the pseudo-government's Huaxing Bank, coupled with the tightening of the US dollar exchange rate and purchasing by Hong Kong syndicates." Looking at the day's proceedings, the market opened high at $4,910, up $25 from the previous day due to the tight US dollar exchange rate. Subsequently, a certain gold firm, securities houses, and a certain bank competed to buy, pushing the price up another $70 to $4,980. However, some cash gold firms and jewelers sold, causing the price to fall back by over $10 to $4,968. Then, as the foreign exchange rate weakened again, buying resumed, reaching $4,985 before the midday close. In the afternoon, a certain securities house continued to aggressively buy, and a Hong Kong syndicate also joined in, snapping up over 500 taels, causing the price to soar to a high of $5,052. Afterwards, a certain gold firm took the opportunity to cash in profits, releasing a substantial amount, coupled with selling from currency exchange businesses and individual investors, causing the situation to reverse downwards. By the evening close, the price had retreated to $4,990, but the final price was $4,995, still a sharp increase of $110 from the previous day. The entire day's trading was extremely active, with over 4,000 taels changing hands. Jewelry gold once reached $510, and although it later retreated slightly, the final price was still $10 higher. Gold for customs duties remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Jumps $110</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (10 taels) saw the US dollar exchange rate reported tight, intensifying market sentiment and creating a buying frenzy. The market opened up $25. A certain bank purchased 20 taels from Yu Hao at $4,910. Shortly after, gold firms and currency exchange businesses scrambled to buy, causing a further increase of $30 in an instant. Gold firms purchased 50 taels from currency exchange businesses at $4,940. Subsequently, because jewelry syndicates and cash gold firms sold aggressively, the price was suppressed by a small amount of $8. Jewelry syndicates sold 50 taels to a certain bank at $4,932. Then, a certain securities house suddenly began to aggressively absorb, while currency exchange businesses and a certain jewelry syndicate also bought, causing another surge of $48. Gold firms purchased 50 taels from banks at $4,980. At that time, a certain currency exchange business switched from buying to selling, and a certain bank also began to sell. Although a certain securities house continued to buy, the market still felt oversupplied, causing a small decline of $12. Currency exchange businesses traded 20 taels amongst themselves at $4,968. Unexpectedly, the foreign exchange rate was suddenly reported tighter, and buying resumed. A certain currency exchange business bought again, and gold firms also released offers to buy, causing a further increase of $17. Gold firms purchased 50 taels from currency exchange businesses at $4,985. Then, a bank sold 10 taels to a gold firm at $4,982, which became the midday closing price. In the afternoon, a certain securities house and a certain cash gold firm began to compete to buy. The market opened up $13. Securities houses purchased 50 taels from currency exchange businesses at $4,995. Subsequently, Currency Exchange Business C also aggressively bought, soon pushing the price up by $57. Securities houses purchased 20 taels from gold firms at $5,052. Later, a certain gold firm continued to sell, coupled with individual investors also competing to take profits, causing the situation to suddenly change and fall back by $62. Currency exchange businesses sold 50 taels to securities houses at $4,990. Afterwards, banks slightly absorbed, pushing the price up again by $5. A certain bank purchased 20 taels from currency exchange businesses at $4,995, which became the evening closing price. As a result, compared to the previous day, the price surged by $110. It has now increased for four consecutive days, for a total increase of $219. The entire day saw fluctuations of $142. The selling price of the cash gold firm's own-brand gold, based on the spot gold price, was several dollars higher. The buying price was $20 lower.

Da Tong Hang changed its quotation to $505. The new companies quoted the same price. The buying price was around $15 lower.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Bills Sharply Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign currencies continued to be affected by the sharp fall in the pound. Demand for British and American pounds was strong, and the market price rose sharply. British gold bills remained stagnant. American bills were absorbed readily, and the increase was sharp, initially rising sharply to $15.40 in the morning, and then reaching a high price of $15.58 in the afternoon. In the evening, the supply became tighter, and the market price relaxed slightly, resulting in $15.42. Hong Kong dollar bills were firm because the Hong Kong exchange rate was strong. Annam and Robi bills were in short supply. Canadian bills and Philippine bills followed the expensive US dollar bills and trended upwards. Japanese gold bills were slightly relaxed, with the evening price being $1.039. Korean bills were even weaker, already falling to the same level as the legal tender. Yesterday's market prices saw British gold pounds and American gold pounds both rise by $3. US dollar bills rose by $0.44. Hong Kong dollar bills rose by $0.015. Annam bills rose by $0.05. Robi bills rose by $0.10. Canadian bills rose by $0.55. Philippine bills rose by $0.20. Other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Food Prices: Foreign Rice Fluctuates Rapidly; Kun Sick's Rice at $50 on the Black Market</h3>
<p>The rice market was closed the day before yesterday due to the memorial day for the passing of Sun Yat-sen. Yesterday, the source of domestic rice was 2,250+ bags of both Japonica and Glutinous that were being routed from Hongkou District. Meanwhile, the black market for foreign rice outside of the bourse initially tightened due to a higher volume of transactions. However, the results were rather languid and prices saw no changes, holding at the original listed prices. Rumor has it that Kun Sick Japonica was $50, Green Si Thin at $48, and early Late varieties at $46-$47. Glutinous rice saw increased imports in the last two days and therefore, although general customers have purchased it due to its lower prices, sellers remained flexible and the market was mediocre, with no particular gains or losses.</p>
<p>Foreign rice had been trending steadily downward this week, but yesterday morning, due to restocking by general merchants, it was heard that the price of gold had skyrocketed to $500 and that the exchange rate was tightening. Public sentiment suddenly stiffened, and original merchants and vendors were unwilling to sell easily. Speculative hoarders also refused to release their goods, and some even wanted to take the opportunity to pull prices higher. As a result, the shouting began, and the situation was unusually tense, reversing the previous fatigue and showing an upward trend. Saigon No. 1 opened at $44.50, which, compared to the $43.50 price the afternoon before the holiday, was an increase of $1. Others, such as Huo Wen at $43.50 and Xiao Jiao at $40, were up by 50 cents to a dollar. At the time, it seemed that there was hope for a turnaround. However, the market's foundation had already weakened, and people remained fearful. Moreover, credit was tight, turnover was difficult, and a large batch of futures was still arriving this month. Generally, people viewed this upward trend as merely a small recovery after a large fall, and that the overall situation could not be salvaged by financial fluctuations. Therefore, merchants and speculative hoarders sold in unison to capitalize on the high prices. Buyers had no intention of buying more than necessary for restocking. As a result, chips were suddenly plentiful, there were few inquiries, and market prices could not be maintained, falling back again and again. The midday closing prices were tight at first but then fatigued, resulting in a stalemate, with no significant changes compared to the previous market's prices. Saigon No. 1 was $44, $43.60; Saigon No. 2 was $40, Special $41.20; Huo Jiao Pagoda Brand was $43, $42.50; Mixed Brand was $42.25, $42; Xiao Jiao was $39.60, $39; Tokyo Grain Tip was $39.50, $39; Siam No. 2 was $39.50, Mixed Broken $35.50, $35, Next $34, Semi-polished $21.50, $31.</p>
<p>The influence of the shortened exchange rate in morning wholesales of foreign rice resulted in spot and futures prices rising once or twice over 10 cents. As soon as the market showed signs of a turnaround, both the Fuka and Heyi foreign firms began to release their goods. Fuka released 500 tons of Saigon No. 1 due April 1 at $52.30, and Heyi released 400 tons at only $52. The market immediately declined. Return Saigon No. 2 opened at $48.60 to $49 and Xiao Wen at $48.68 to $49, but the market for recycled futures lacked buyers after foreign merchants sold off their holdings. Current foreign rice prices were level or unchanged since the early price gains, at a value similar to the prior day, but about 7,000-8,000 bags sold.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 8,911 bags of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai, transported by the Taigu Company's Qingyuan vessel from Hong Kong. It arrived in Shanghai at approximately 7:00 AM yesterday morning and docked at the French Concession's own wharf to unload. (Zu)</p>
<h3>Returned Flour Market Trends Upward; Wheat Prices Reach $25 Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market trended upwards. The No. 2 Flour Mill's disk was still in its flat-sale period, and as such saw no fluctuations. However, the limited time is only one week and worries that the flat-sale period ending on the 19th would trigger price increases have already emerged. The market remains focused on the returned-to-port inventory to decorate and pad. Rumor has it that with the abolition of export bans for the Green Artillery, Northern gangs continued to load and sell for $15. Old models with good sales in the interior townships sold for $44.50. It was heard that the margin skyrocketed later in the market, with gains of up to 5-10 cents.</p>
<p>Wheat: The market was also turned upward yesterday due to good gains by a certain factory, and there were also rumors of increased purchasing of exported inventory. Suzhou wheat from the North again reached $25/unit. Bengbu wheat opened at $24.75 and Chang wheat at $24.5, selling at 15-16 truckloads of volume.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Buyers Rally, Cotton Yarn Grows More Vigorously; March Futures of Double Horses Traded Over $987.50</h3>
<p>The yarn market surged forward and retreated rapidly, and was intensely energetic. This resulted from a tighter exchange rate and a stirred public that increased the buying interest, and this resulted in a more forceful market trend. Actual sales of yarn in South China remained comparatively active; however, the level of procurement has not seen a large increase. As the gold market has risen and the exchange rates become short and high, speculators will certainly pull up inventory to a situation of non-relaxation. In the afternoon, public sentiment was more vigorous and the March 20s Double Horses Futures traded at $987.50.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for existing yarn inventories saw aggressive buyer interest in response to high public sentiment in the afternoon before the day. The opening price for March 20s Double Horses futures reached $985, and sellers rushed to capitalize on gains, rapidly weakening the momentum and reducing the price by $1.62. By the end of market, it was heard that the US exchange rates tightened and the buying interest rose again. The price trend rebounded to $969, and the calculated volume of transactions at the end of a half-day totaled 3,765 packages. Existing yarn prices for 20s Double Horse grew by $13 per unit. It was recorded that 30 units of cotton yarn were being shipped to Haiphong, 100 units to Haikou, 75 units to the Guangzhou Bay, and 40 units to Hong Kong. A breakdown of the volume being procured by local gangs follows: Local dealers: 3,410; Hong Kong: 340; Wenzhou: 15; Total: 3,765.</p>
<h3>Cotton Mill Procurement has Begun; Local Dealers Feel Stifled</h3>
<p>Trade in existing cotton inventories has again grown lively as the cotton mills are seeing growing procurement of 32s and 60s raw materials by Shenxin and Yufeng plants, and cotton purchases by Xinyu consist of 20s and 32s raw materials. Cotton prices have dropped with Indian cotton being cheaper on the currency exchange, and so the local market is uninspired. Market conditions for existing inventory is still complex as American cotton remains tight, so the existing situation is as follows:</p>
<p>News of Foreign Cotton Prices: Prices on the New York Cotton Bourse were pushed down 5-6 pounds in the morning due to low numbers telegraphed from Liverpool and the low performance of the Indian cotton markets, but saw some recovery in price through local trading and some short covering. End of market prices had risen +11 pounds compared to the prior day with futures rising 4-5 pounds. Indian cotton yesterday also declined 6 Robies, and it is predicted that some will see recovery to +2 Robies in volume. Egyptian Cotton has dropped 10 pounds.</p>
<h3>Securities: Unified Class C Approaches $8; Ye Guang Stocks Rise Before Falling</h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities market was showing increasing signs of being unable to withstand the high pressure of a sharp reduction of foreign exchange and skyrocketing gold prices, with a gradual trend toward lower prices. Cracks have been shown in positions taken by bullish speculators, and the dumping by Lianhe Company has been most evident. Public debt has long been of little interest to capital-heavy investors, and as such, there has been no great flood of dumping on the market. The sale of 400,000 RMB of Class C stocks sold by Lianhe was the most significant. The other securities companies all procured through cover buys, but the supply still outpaced demand, and the market gradually fatigued. The 8 RMB-range for Class C stocks has been broken, and all stocks followed the market downtrend. The end of market saw losses of 0.25-0.6 RMB with a total turnover of ~ 1,000,000 RMB. A simple summary follows:</p>
<p>Stock Transactions: 50 shares of Zhonghua Publishing sold at 32 RMB each. The stock market for public companies remains dim, with no pressure from sellers and no changes in prices. Real estate stocks rose from 15.4 to 16.5 RMB on rumors that rentals for properties in Hongkou district would be rising. The trend increased so fast that sellers took to the market to capitalize on their gains, and the market reversed itself to 15.9 RMB on the buy and 16 RMB on the sell side. Rubber stocks have been ignored.</p>
<h3>Mixed Grains: Soybean Market, Oil Presses Account for 3/4</h3>
<p>The mixed grain market, which was closed in commemoration of the General Manager, resumed as normal. The soybean market was especially active, with oil presses accounting for 3/4 of all sales, and the rest going to Nanyang hoarders from this street. All parties have heatedly tried to raise prices, with average prices for lower and mid-grade inventory increasing by 1 RMB. Higher grade soybean sales saw marginal gains of 50-60 cents, with a total volume of the following: Bengbu Soybean- Truckload at $25.50; Mulberry Garden Bean – 120 packages at $22.50-$21; Nanjing Bean – 4 truckloads at $25-$23.50, Average at $21; Wuhu Bean – 3 truckloads at $25.50-$24.50; Dingjiazhou Bean – 600+ packages at $26.50-$26; Yangzhou Mountain Bean – 2 truckloads at $23.60-$23; Chongming Shayang – 600+ packages at $25.20-$23; Pinghu Du Bean – 300+ packages at $27-$24; Jiangbei Qing Bean sold 700 packages to factories and hoarders from this street at prices that gradually rose from $20.60 to $21.50.</p>

<p>— Wang Maozu</p>
<p>Third, Methods of Life Guidance The objective of life guidance is to channel the thoughts, emotions, and actions of young people towards national rejuvenation and to strengthen the forces of resistance and nation-building. The guiding principle should be based on the New Life Movement, providing guidance and direction on all aspects of daily life—clothing, food, housing, and transportation—to align with the principles of life—propriety, righteousness, integrity, and sense of shame. However, guidance must have a methodology to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Based on the aforementioned characteristics of adolescence, I will further elaborate as follows: (1) "Suggestion and Inspiration" First, young people are susceptible to suggestion, so the impression teachers give to students must be pure and profound. In addition to leading by example, they must also join student groups, collaborate with them, observe student actions, and provide guidance as needed. The school environment must also be arranged to eliminate all negative stimuli. In regular classes, regardless of the subject taught, it is necessary to constantly highlight the points related to morality and life, expanding their concepts so that they can be applied to all aspects of daily life. For example, cleanliness, speed, accuracy, and the habit of thinking about things can be cultivated in mathematics and natural science. By analogy, the teaching value of each subject is not limited to the practical knowledge of the subject itself, but its function can be aggregated into the cultivation of personality. Second, extracurricular activities are even greater opportunities for life guidance. Students should be allowed to organize themselves and be supervised and assisted by counselors to cultivate students' ability to act automatically and organize. It is essential not to let teachers take the initiative entirely, which would result in mechanical forms. In addition, it is necessary to visit families, report the advantages and disadvantages of each student to parents to encourage them to pay attention. Third, the teaching policy should be based on Sun Yat-sen's teachings and President Chiang Kai-shek's instructions, and should also select pictures, biographies, etc. of giants, great virtues, thinkers, scientists, industrialists, and explorers from Chinese and foreign history for students to emulate. The selection of student reading materials should be able to inspire thought and wisdom, nurture morality and personality, provide correct explanations for modern social problems, and promote students' lofty ideals and noble outlook on life. Guide extracurricular reading. Fourth, young people have weak comprehension but like to debate. Discussion groups on current events should be organized to allow everyone to state their opinions, which are then summarized by the teacher, and questions should be repeatedly asked to discover their naivety and make them aware of their errors to reach correct conclusions. Socrates' method of dialogue and inspiration is very useful. (2) "Transplantation and Sublimation" Ways should be found to channel and release the movements and surplus energy of young people. One method of guidance is substitution or transplantation. Substitution is selecting good stimuli to replace bad stimuli. For example, hand movements, from small to large, can be said to be incessant. Once they stop, they will scribble when they see chalk, play with objects, or create all sorts of mischief. Therefore, hand labor must be intentionally trained. It is best to equip each person with a set of simple tools, or paintings or crafts, for them to practice in their spare time. Transplantation is transferring harmful reactions to beneficial reactions. For example, the aforementioned antagonistic competition can be regulated to cultivate fair competition. To go further, to enable citizens to abandon private fights and courageously engage in public battles is also a kind of transplantation method. Sublimation is the transformation of human desires from lower to higher expressions. For example, the diversion of sexual desires and boredom can be promoted through music, literature, recreation, sports, and various service activities to channel their attention to some task of interest and turn the original desire into a driving force for their careers.</p>

<h3>Scott Cup Final: Lido to Play with Reserves; Injuries Mount, Helpless; Tens of Thousands of Fans Will Be Disappointed</h3>
<p>The Scott Cup Football Championship, after Donghua quickly lost it to foreign teams for three years, Lido surprisingly won it back last year, restoring the pride of Chinese teams. This year's Scott Cup competition has attracted as many as fourteen teams, making it a grand event. Lido, as the defending champion, broke through Survey, defeated the British Army, and smoothly reached the final week. They are scheduled to compete against Portuguese Businesses this Saturday for the championship. Lido's only strong rivals in the Scott Cup were Dong Sailai and West Force. Currently, the British Army has been defeated by Lido in the semi-final week, and West Force has been eliminated by Portuguese Businesses. Strong enemies have been eliminated. The Portuguese are not to be feared, but Lido, in order to maintain the spirit of sportsmanship, does not want to compete too fiercely. Furthermore, many players were injured in the match against Dong Sailai. Li Yichen, Zhang Lin'gen, Jiang Zhaoxiang, Meng Yiliang, Huang Kehou, Xu Wenkui, Cao Qiuting, etc., are either ill or injured, making it difficult to field a full team for this Scott Cup final. It is heard that Lido may use the same lineup as last week's match against the French Businesses to compete with the Portuguese Businesses, but this is a last resort. Tens of thousands of fans will be greatly disappointed. The ticket revenue of Western football clubs will also be greatly affected.</p>

<h3>Salt Yard Oversupply</h3>
<p>Since the Huai Riverbank has not been fully restored, the sales channels are limited, and the salt yards are accumulating more and more salt over time. After previous inspections, a comprehensive review was conducted on all the fields in Tongtai, summarizing the total amounts as of the end of April this year. Excluding the salt stored in Yizhan, the Tong area, under the inspection, has a total of 138,097 barrels and six fen and one li of pointed salt, 8,936 barrels and six fen and four li of mixed salt, and 243 barrels and eight fen of alkaline salt. Under subsequent receipts, there are a total of 539,105 barrels and six fen and two li of pointed salt, 68,183 barrels and three fen and two li of mixed salt, and 68,650 barrels and six fen and nine li of alkaline salt. In the Tai area, under the inspection, there are a total of 381,565 barrels and three fen and four li of pointed salt, 249,112 barrels and three fen and nine li of mixed salt, and 421 barrels and four li of alkaline salt. Under subsequent receipts, there are a total of 827,015 barrels and four fen and six li and eight hao of pointed salt, 613,572 barrels and seven fen and eight li of mixed salt, and 82,888 barrels and two fen and four li and two hao of alkaline salt. There are also 1,123 barrels and one fen and five li of newly received Pu Lin pointed salt. In total, there are 1,968,835 barrels and nine li of salt in storage. Calculated at three barrels and five fen per yin, this amounts to nearly 900,000 yin. Based on annual coastal sales, it will take nearly three years to transport all the salt. During these three years, new salt will continue to accumulate in the various fields, inevitably increasing year by year. In this situation, the cost is locked up, and the merchants are becoming increasingly distressed, which is unsustainable. It is now heard that the Ministry is considering the restoration of the Huai Riverbank as a priority, and the Governor-General of Liangjiang is also strongly advocating for it. It remains to be seen how the provinces of Sichuan and Hubei will respond and whether there will be any turnaround for the Huai merchants. This matter will be closely watched.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>Small Talk</p>
<h3>The Source of Articles</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiayin</p>
<p>In my opinion, the sources of articles can be divided into three categories: The first is firsthand experience, personal observation, or the result of one's own reasoning, which belongs to the realm of original creation.</p>
<p>The second is written records of what one has heard, which is not as authentic or profound as the first type. However, if the speaker is reliable and the recorder has a knack for writing, it can still be a good article.</p>
<p>The third is the compilation of materials from various books, newspapers, and magazines, which belongs to the realm of translation and editing. This type of article also requires considerable artistic cultivation and effort and is completely different from plagiarism.</p>
<p>Among the above three types, the first type of writing is the most valuable. However, it is not always possible for every writer and reporter to have firsthand experience before writing an article. Therefore, feature articles in foreign newspapers and magazines often draw from all three sources. The most ideal situation is, of course, a combination of all three sources, which results in the richest content and the most profound descriptions. Even articles with only two sources are already good.</p>
<p>In the future, the criteria for selecting manuscripts for Free Talk will also strictly adhere to the above-mentioned sources of article materials. We hope that the authors of every article, long or short, will provide detailed information about the source of the materials, especially for articles that are translated or edited. The original author, publisher, and publication date must be clearly indicated. Considering that Free Talk belongs to the readers, we hope to provide readers with a guarantee of meaningful and valuable spiritual nourishment.</p>
<p>Manuscripts plagiarized from old newspapers are strongly discouraged from being submitted!</p>
<h3>War: Anti-Gas Campaigns in European Countries</h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>The god of war has plunged the hearts of Europeans entirely into the terror of poisonous gas. Newspapers are using eye-catching, startling headlines to report that laboratories are stepping up the production of some novel and potent poisonous gas. In magazines of various countries, such as London's 'Observer' and Paris's "La MATIN," there are texts debating war: Can enemy aircraft's mustard gas bombs suffocate the entire city? Or are they merely advertisements pushed by arms dealers to sell goods? There are also news items such as Parisians busily surveying gas shelters and Londoners discussing the construction of field hospitals for gas protection. Indeed, Europeans are panicked and at a loss under the threat of poisonous gas, finding no way to escape.</p>
<p>In addition to urging people and governments to pay attention to preventing the threat of poisonous gas, the International Red Cross in Geneva has recently published a monthly magazine dedicated to reporting the implementation and results of anti-gas campaigns. Numerous shops in Paris display gas masks in large glass windows. In Rome, many large department stores place a mannequin wearing a strange mask in front of the window, staring outward as if warning that the god of death is about to fall from the sky. In London, the number of gas masks sold is astonishing. Usually, each mask is worth about 15 US dollars, but with the recent increase in production, supply exceeds demand, and the price has dropped to 7 US dollars per mask.</p>
<p>Germany is training the public to fully recognize various poisonous gases. White cross gas is a "tear gas" that can cause people to tear up. In severe cases, it can cause complete vision loss, bleeding, and death. Green cross and blue cross gases are "lung-rotting gases." Under the dissemination of the above three types of poisonous gas, gas masks are only sufficient to protect people's eyes and respiratory systems. There is also a yellow cross or mustard gas that can only be defended against with a full-body rubber suit, as it can penetrate thick woolen uniforms and skin and reach the internal organs. Residents of major German cities have extensive knowledge of the above-mentioned poisonous gases. To familiarize the public, the authorities sell boxes containing glass tubes filled with small amounts of the four types of poisonous gas. Buyers can attach each glass tube to a toy cannon. When the cannon is fired, the poisonous gas inside the glass tube is released, allowing citizens to distinguish the different characteristics of each type of poisonous gas's odor.</p>
<p>Recently, a portable "gas shelter" has become popular in Paris. It is made of metal plates formed into a small pavilion, equipped with oxygen equipment inside. Each shelter can accommodate ten people and costs about 95 US dollars. It can last for up to eight hours when the door is closed. Outside of the city, camps and cellars, such as field hospitals, provide shelter for about 500 citizens in Paris. Italy's Mussolini had already formulated a plan for the safe evacuation of residents in the event of a declaration of war and printed its outline in a booklet for distribution throughout the country.</p>
<p>Regarding the protection of citizens, a certain French general said: "We certainly cannot completely protect all citizens of a large city from the traps of bombs and poisonous gas... but if we can save five and a half out of a thousand people, the efforts we have made can be considered rewarded."</p>
<p>Today, European countries are both stepping up the production of lethal weapons on a large scale and making various anti-gas preparations. The tragic re-enactment of the history of war is only a matter of time.</p>

<h3>The European War and Crime (Part 1) Death Penalty, Death Penalty, Death Penalty - Germany</h3>
<p>— Shi Tao</p>
<p>At the same time as the German army attacked Poland, Hitler issued a serious warning to the German people: "While the soldiers on the front lines are staking their lives in battle, any citizen who takes advantage of the war to enrich themselves will be courting death!" German wartime criminal law, wartime economic law, and general wartime regulations all embody this spirit. Therefore, since the war began, the daily life of Germans seems to be approaching the death penalty. For example, last October, a 27-year-old young man took advantage of the darkness of the blackout to steal a purse containing collections placed by a female shop assistant. At that time, the Berlin Special Court sentenced the young man to death, which shocked the entire Germany. The verdict was based on the "Offenders Against National Life" ordinance, the first item of which was "Crimes Utilizing Air Defense Measures," which stipulated the death penalty for those who commit crimes against body, life, or property by taking advantage of the blackout. Therefore, the young man became the first person to be subject to this ordinance.</p>
<p>Although the law was so strict, news of people being executed for violating that law appeared in newspapers almost every week thereafter. On November 27, a 23-year-old man born in Nuremberg tried to steal the money bag of a coffee shop waitress, but unfortunately, his initial attempt failed. Thus, he ended his life on the gallows. The reason for the verdict was: "Every working woman has the right to safely return home on the streets during the blackout. To ensure the safety of the dark streets, even though the defendant is a first-time offender, the death penalty is appropriate."</p>
<p>At the end of last year, a man was finally sentenced to death by the High Court for indecent assault on women in the dark. Arsonists, etc., were punished much more severely than usual. A man named Grafa set fire to his flour mill in order to defraud insurance money, and the wheat stored in the warehouse was reduced to ashes along with it. Later, this man was also sentenced to death, the reason being: "The defendant turned the necessities of German national life during the war into nothingness, damaging Germany's economic ability to resist the war. Therefore, the defendant is an offender against national life and is sentenced to death."</p>
<p>In wartime Germany, the interests of the country must be placed before personal interests. If you break someone else's hand or foot, you will also be sentenced to death, because this damages human resources and reduces Germany's ability to resist the war. In the economic sphere, everyone knows that Germany is now implementing a shopping coupon system, and crimes that violate price control orders are also emerging one after another. For example, at the beginning of the war, the owner of the famous Filsdaan Hotel in Berlin was fined 300,000 marks for violating wartime prices and providing food. Since the news was published in the newspaper, the entire food and beverage industry has not dared to disobey the control. Other incidents of exposing large-scale price transactions are simply too numerous to count.</p>
<p>Since the start of the war, more than a dozen Germans have been executed for leaking state secrets. Therefore, we can imagine that espionage activities in Germany must be quite lively. As for anti-National Socialist political prisoners, they are absolutely not something outsiders can know. Even the bomber who tried to kill Hitler in Munich is still some kind of non-news to this day.</p>

<h3>Clouds of Jimei: Impressions of Zhou Bichu's Oil Landscape Paintings</h3>
<p>— Wu Cun</p>
<p>Several years ago, I had already urged Mr. Zhou Bichu, an artist known for his bright landscape paintings, to hold a solo exhibition. Mr. Zhou always modestly said, "Let's wait a little longer." When Mr. Zhou returned with great acclaim after holding an exhibition in Fujian Province at the invitation of the Fujian Provincial Department of Education (during the tenure of Huang Mengkui as Minister of Education in 1932), I urged him again, but he still modestly said, "Let's wait a little longer."</p>
<p>Last autumn, I saw his masterpiece "Clouds of Jimei" in Mr. Zhou's studio. Its brightness, its beauty, its atmosphere, all made me feel that Mr. Zhou's paintings had reached a very high level of achievement. Jimei is the only school village in southern Fujian. I received education there as a child, and the scenery of the village has always been admired. After the war, Xiamen was occupied, and Jimei was constantly bombed. The school village has become a scorched earth, and the beautiful clouds of Jimei have become pervasive war clouds. Therefore, this masterpiece has gained unparalleled value.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou's landscape works are comparable to those of Mr. Zhou Tingxu, whose name is renowned in the international art world (coincidentally, both Mr. Zhous are from the same hometown). I don't understand painting, but I have a strong interest in painting because the film I work in is related to painting. This time, I was able to see Mr. Zhou's preview and fulfill my wish to urge him to hold a solo exhibition. I am very happy and content, so I scribble down this article.</p>
<h3>The Age of the Earth</h3>
<p>— Xu Mengbiao</p>
<p>The Earth existed long before humans, and its age is unknown. Now, some scientists have used various methods to estimate its age. French geologist Gauder believes that the solid crust existed as early as 200 million years ago. Others estimate the history of the Earth to be even longer than 200 million years.</p>
<p>As for the basis for studying this question, some analyze the chemical composition of the Earth's crust; others use the Earth's diameter as a starting point for research; if we observe the movement of the Moon from an astronomical perspective, we can also solve the problem of the Earth's age.</p>

<h3>Citizens of the Kingdom (3)</h3>
<p>A person cannot be considered a citizen of the kingdom simply because of their belief. The so-called kingdom is not only a matter of belief but also a code of conduct. That scholar knew his theology, was familiar with all the doctrines of religion, and could fluently recite the laws of Sabbath keeping, the rite of Holy Communion, and the various habits and methods of prayer. He had a systematic belief that he was able to memorize and recite, but Jesus told him that that was not the true essence of religion. Because it is not only a believing heart that makes a person a Christian. A person can have a believing heart like an angel and at the same time behave like a devil. He can know all the religious laws and rituals while lacking pure thoughts and generous compassion. For anyone like this, his religion is only a set of doctrines unrelated to life and is all outside the realm of the kingdom. We want to test a person's beliefs simply by looking at his life. It is possible to believe in a doctrine while remaining unconcerned with personal dignity and social justice. Sincerity is a virtue, but sincerity alone cannot make a person a citizen of the kingdom, because sincerity, without tolerance, reason, and charity, is often the opposite of religion. If a person is sincere, we should respect him, but in fact, his sincerity can never make him free from fault. Jesus was nailed to the cross, and those who did it were undoubtedly sincere in their beliefs, and yet. Jesus prayed for them, because they were sincere, but ignorant. Sincerity without knowledge turns faith into stubborn obstinacy. Because it can only make a person fervent but cannot make a person blameless. Saul of Tarsus, who wanted to kill the Christians of Damascus, was absolutely sincere in his mind, and from that time on, millions of people were killed and became martyrs because of those sincere but misguided accusers. Therefore, we must not only be sincere but also have enlightened minds and charitable hearts. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Silver Screen Anecdotes</p>
<h3>African Black Films: Jingyi, the director and cinematographer are all black. Actors are paid in livestock.</h3>
<p>— Jingyi</p>
<p>In Da Kao Nigeria in Africa, there is a black film company. The supervisor of the company is a black man named Nokdto Tuo. He was born in the United States. Film is his only hobby. He went to Hollywood to study film production techniques. After completing his studies, he opened this black film company.</p>
<p>The initial capital of the company was five yuan. The shareholders are all black. Even the directors, photographers and set designers are all black. Black actors do not like surplus money, so the company pays them mostly in livestock such as cattle and sheep. Hiring a leading actor often requires nearly a hundred cattle or more sheep as salary.</p>
<p>After the first film was shot, it caused a sensation. Black films were an unprecedented initiative, so the business was very prosperous. So the company increased its capital and continued to film. But when shooting a film with a night festival ceremony as the background, because the light was too dark, plus the leading actor's dark face, when it was filmed and released, the holes on the silver screen became looming black shadows. So no one watched the film, and the company lost a lot of money. The leading actor also demanded that the company compensate him for his loss of reputation. Since then, this black film company has not dared to shoot films with night scenes again.</p>

<h3>The prelude to amusement and disaster relief</h3>
<p>— Choucheng</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Compatriot Group Fundraising Committee has determined that the cost of refugee rations has more than doubled compared to last spring due to the high cost of everything recently. If there is no other way to raise funds, it is quite difficult to maintain. It has been decided that from this month</p>
<p>Starting on the 16th until the 22nd, the "Amusement and Disaster Relief Conference" will be held to raise funds. The location is in the New World. Within this week, we will also ask the leaders of the entertainment industry in Shanghai for special help. Yesterday, at the Tao Lechun Vegetable Society, famous amateur and professional actors were invited to discuss the methods. After Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Ludeng thanked the New World authorities for leasing the venue at a low price, they agreed with the entertainers to participate in the group as follows: (1) Peking Opera: Fudan University Alumni Association, China United Happy Association, Qian Duiye Friendship Association, Shengshe Pingshe Happy three ticket offices, and the Municipal Council Chinese Staff Club: (2) Spoken Drama: Yiwen Troupe, China United Happy Association, Silk and Cloth Industry Mutual Aid Association, Sino-French Alumni Association, Huanqiu, Lianqun, Modern, Yingyin, Islamic and other five drama clubs: (3) Film: Guohua, Yihua, Xinhua, China United and other four film companies, (4) Music: Vocal Music Friendship Association, Yafeng Music Society, (5) Martial Arts, Jingwu Athletic Association, (6) Miscellaneous dramas: Shanghai Amusement Friendship Association.

<p>Remembering Liu Hongsheng's Sudden Death (Part 2)</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, during his last visit to Shanghai, because the owner of the garden praised him so much, he couldn't help but want to sell more energy. One day, his "Perfect Return to Zhao" was scheduled, and he felt that this play, in addition to the "Just Received Orders to Go to Western Qin" section of the Xipi original board, did not have any major singing, which was too easy, so he specially added a cross-dressing performance of Cao Cao in "Yangping Pass" in front. The most difficult part of this play is the big introduction when he comes on stage. Insiders call this the Tiger Head Introduction, which is considered the most difficult among the net roles. As for the singing in the back, it is not very difficult at all. Because Hongsheng wanted to show off his black voice, he had to put in all his energy and spirit to do it. Unexpectedly, after all these years of not singing, the usage of the raw net voice is completely different from that of the gong, and it is very different. When he read it, he inevitably used too much force, and he already felt the blood churning upwards, and he couldn't support it anymore. What's more, he was over fifty years old and had been excessively lustful when he was young, which crippled one of his legs, which was the reason. When the finale "Perfect Return to Zhao" came on stage, he was even more dizzy and dizzy, and he barely sang halfway when he suddenly fell to the ground and vomited blood. After his death, various rumors spread in the opera troupe. Some said that Zhang Yuting had come to take revenge, and some said that Liu's adoptive father, Mr. Li, had come to capture him alive. It turned out that when Zhang Yuting went south from Tianjin that year, he heard on the ship that Hongsheng was also taking a stage on the sea. In the future, the two sides would compete against each other. Yuting thought to himself, his voice could not compete with Liu. What's more, after he vomited blood, his body was weak and had not recovered. This scare caused him to vomit blood and die. As for Hongsheng's adoptive father, Mr. Li, he was originally a wealthy businessman. When Hongsheng contracted a venereal disease and crippled one of his feet, he was so poor that he was about to die. Fortunately, Mr. Li took him to his home, extended medical treatment, and recuperated him, so that he could actually go on stage again. This was considered his great benefactor: Unexpectedly, Liu even fornicated with his wife, and Li died in resentment. After Hongsheng's death, his colleagues announced it for him. Regardless of whether these superstitious things are true or not, I think it is important for all people not to be ungrateful or kick the ladder after crossing the river, and even more so to repay kindness with resentment and even fornicate with the wife and daughter of one's benefactor. That kind of sin is even greater. Luo Xiaobao is indeed worthy of being praised, first of all because of his good personality, which can be said to be worlds apart from Liu.</p>
