<p>社評</p>
<h3>片段之日本時論</h3>
<p>日本人決非卑劣愚蠢之民族，日本今日在政治經濟國際種種方面陷於艱窘瀕絕之境地者，亦決不以卑劣愚蠢爲之因果。日本無獨到之文化，日本對人類文明無甚貢獻，然日本在每一時代皆能急起直追皆能接近當代文化之水準。日本今日處境，在彼民族進化過程之中，實爲一時之逆轉，厥責乃在彼民族中畸形發展之一階層：故就日本全民族而論，非惟不必視爲可憎，抑且甚堪向情。雖一階層之崎形發展，在原因上應由日本全民族分負其責任，在結果上必由日本全民族共食其報應；然亦祇能論斷爲全族猶未健全所致。而不必對彼全族遽作無情之非難。</p>
<p>右述槪念，非直覺，非武斷，竊信可資說明之根據與料資至爲豐富，非此短文所克申論。茲之述此槪念者，在茲日本深入歧途，積重難返，正義湮沒，民氣消沉之會，偶聞日人方面時論數端，不禁爲之感慨不絕於心；爰舉槪念，藉作感慨之前提。夫何時論？昨日東京若干報章，評述其下年度一百五十萬萬圓之預算案。當預算案由內閣提交議會之日，全院噤若寒蟬，遂通過成立於悽凉沉默之中；夫明明絕無忠實實施之可能性，而內閣提出之，議會贊成之，此其可譏可駭，殆得取爲對於日本民族重新估價之切實論據。及於其通過後之匝月，報章卒以不安緘默而加評述，其辭婉，其意諷，其心苦而其流露者哀目憔悴。然則預算案所表現者，祗宜對彼貿然提出，默然贊助者，作爲估價之資；固未宜據以估彼全民族，此得以若干報章爲明證者也。此一端也。日本衆議院議員齋藤隆夫案，吾人未欲置一辭，蓋齋滕當時言論雖於事後傳誦遐邇，然所傳所據乃既爲由議長命令修正刪節之紀錄，改頭換面、必已失真故無自而知齋藤之中心意識，究爲對彼畸形階層之逆耳忠言，抑爲迎合畸形階層而求榮取辱。齋藤案後無幾日，有米內山庸夫者，在彼外交界積勞累晋至領事官級，居留中國既閱三十年；以日本登庸銓叙之嚴格，積資格而至領事官者，非復等閑；乃因著文日「處理事變之基調」，載日本權威雜誌「外交時報」二月號，外交主管機關惶懼於其論旨之拂逆畸形階級意態，或將不免於引起言論獄而連累上司，遽予免職處分，冀輕咎戾。米內論文致疑於其當局處理所謂中國事變之失當，謂千思萬想，憂愁苦悶至於極點。彼自信研究中國且理解中國者至深切，彼以日本前首相阿部所謂「此决中國事變，雖名爲事變，實日本有史以來之大戰事」一語，爲全文首尾之綫索；揭發日本對此實際之空前對外大戰事，而希圖視爲國內事變，乃得隨便以片面之規定而處理之，乃爲日本當局根本之矛盾與謬誤。彼謂：一在彼憂危而決心且覺悟之中國人，凡聞近衛聲明，無不認爲一種無聊之表示」；日本之「百萬旌旗，擁護近衛聲明，無非代中國人結局勝利作吶喊」而已；日本關於一解決此决中國事變之時期，最初謂需二月，一變而謂速戰速決需一年，，再變而謂長期戰爭，甚至謂需百年戰爭；中國人則自始不視此爲簡單之事變，而視爲兩國戰爭。民族戰爭，故自始決定長期抗戰；願見兩民族之存在，而知中國決不被日本屈服，蓋中國自始即有此種覺悟者也」；日本若「不獲戰果，便是失敗；雖一時勝利或局部勝利，與全盤失敗毫無差異。」彼謂一二八之役，日軍佔嘉定而不進攻崑山蘇州者，當時日軍當局謂「恐被中國戰略所誘而入無涯深處，致陷泥田，不可拔足」。遂以淞滬協定而和平解決云；言外之意，憂怨於今日之竟入無涯深處而竟不能自拔，但未公然慨言之耳。彼謂目覩日軍在上海與嘉定間極短距離，輜重行軍，艱難萬狀；「中國輕快如飛鳥，僅携少許武器彈藥，便能强力抵抗」，「日本則必携帶多量武器彈藥食糧馬料以及一切生活資料而行軍一。米內探中國歷史之跡，治理之原，洋洋長文，極饒深意；要在直批東亞協同體之頰，而發日本現行方針之謬；凡上所舉，僅其原文百之一二，亦未盡其精采。總之，日本今日而有此類論文，至少證明日本全族之非卑劣愚蠢。此又一端也。昨日美國合衆社東京電，又傳日本外交時報記者松本某之言，謂「國民政府擁有無數之中國民衆，且中國人民多係抗日者」，「有謂國民政府之實力薄弱者，實爲錯誤之估計，國共兩黨雖嘗有爭執，然並不如日本報紙所傳之甚」。彼亦日本人，能以冷靜頭腦，準確觀察，對日本樂觀派作無情之當頭棒喝者也。此又一端也。</p>
<p>吾人往嘗衷誠期望日本方面能及早恢復理智，憂傷世變，悲天憫人，遂不自禁期望之痴。乃以時間之賜，及至今茲，漸聞米內松本云云。雖其觀點論據，非爲吾人所全部接受；而少數明達之說，初未可遽視爲代表日本全族之見解；且在彼箝制言論政策之下，亦難望深入民間，推動生效；然近頃所聞者，乃爲往嘗所不獲聞也。鑒彼戰時負有國家重任之當局，高談政治協作，和平提携之說，知日本士氣民心之自此更難赴戰；鑒彼財力艱枯，預算難行，知日本侵略軍事之將無以維持；鑒彼中庸之論既漸見朕兆，明達之儔或漸决揚眉，知日本恢復理智之期望未謂痴願；然則彼畸形發展之階層雖欲一手掩沒曙光而使遠東長此黑暗，蓋必爲大勢所不許；不然，彼階層者殆亦醒覺之期不在遠矣乎…</p>

<p>春秋擴大「防勞運動」！  基茲　　由於人口稠密和生活惡劣，「孤島」上的肺癆病患者是日趨於增多，據一般的統計，每年間上海將要有二萬的肺癆病患者死亡；和二十萬還在苟延殘喘的肺癆病息者。這，確是一個可怕而驚人的數字！　　最近，爲了適應這種需要，遂有了「上海防癆會」的組織，這正是一般市民的福音。但是我還希望這種運勤能够更加的普遍起來。　　肺癆的病症，在下層階級中存在得更容易增多，因爲下層階級的生活是更惡劣而人口是更稠密。他們沒有好的住所和好的食物：甚至沒有新鮮的空氣來供他們呼吸；再加之一天十幾小時的工作，肺癆便會租容易的向他們來侵襲。而這種病症在他們裏面蔓延得也很利害，因爲他們那裏十幾個人住一個房間是一件很普通的事。所以如果要澈底的防止肺癆，在這一層階級裏必需要有相當的工作。　　在下層階級裏推行防癆運動，除了大施宜傳，對他們講述肺癆的害處，叫他們講究衛生……，以外，還要施行一番普遍的檢查，因爲這裏面或許將有已得肺癆病的，那末在檢查出以後，就可以叫他搬開；替他治療，這樣旣可免得傳染給別人，又可使他本人早日恢復健廣。不過這種檢查最好不要收費，先來一個簡單的檢查，如果覺得確有肺癆病的可疑，再替他施行Ｘ光綫的診察和其他的手術，這時可叫他盡可能的出一點醫藥費，能完全盡義務，當然更好。　　這是一件很迫切的事情，望全市的醫生總動員來擴大（防癆運動」！爲什麼要先收體育費  西西　　戰後學校都遷在兩租界內上課，一時大有閙校舍荒之憂，於是各校相繼把不大主要的課程，儘量的削去，而上半天的課，這樣可調劑學生多而敎室少的缺陷。在此種情况下，體育當然在（豁免」之例了。一　　我校就是一向上半天的課，且無體育一課，但是本學期起除增收雜費外，再另加體育費二元，當時我們一般學生以爲平日缺乏運動，妨碍身體的健康，一聞要租借運動塲，都喜出望外，尤其是素嗜運動的同學，更希望有廣大的球塲，來滿足他們的慾望。就是筆者也認爲此舉不但使一般精神萎靡，身弱多病的同學，一變爲朝氣蓬勃，體强力壯的勇士，抑且使時進影戲院或跳舞塲的，從此可减少他們的足跡。　　可是我們上課了二星期却不見有運動的塲所，於是相繼去詢間敎導主任，爲什麼收了體育費而沒有運動塲？究竟是在校外而尙未修葺竣呢，還是已經借了而塲主不允作爲運動塲？這位敎導主任的回答是：「添闢運動塲，却是在將開學時才議決的，因爲時間忽迫，一時無法我到，所以先收了再說，總之，現在學校當局正在極力尋求中。」後來再問他；爲什麼不待找到後再徵收？他說：「目前百物飛漲，學校支出激增，一旦租借到手，恐無力預墊租金，故不得不先行徵收。」　　以一個大學附屬中學，學生數達千餘之衆，連區區租借運動塲費也沒有，試問誰能相信？　　如今上課快將一個月了，運動塲依然沒有借到，體育費也不見發還，未知學校當局是否借此名義來作增加學費的妙計呢？或以百物飛漲的藉口來彌補學校支出的激增？眞是百思不解，望學校負責人看了此文作一個正直的解答。雨過天青  包天笑　　廿二回　新聞要訉天外飛來　崇議論人間信仰　　目說邵慧華，瞿　雙　人，引導一班姊妹，參觀報館。由機器房　到鑄字房，不免談論到漢字之多，也引起了鑄字的麻煩。預測到要廢漢字，也个是一朝一夕功，所望世界語的大家提倡，日漸推廣。直要等到將來小孩子，不讀漢文，只識世界語，方能有濟。她們談談說說，從鑄字房走到旁邊的字模房。只見各種各樣的銅模，排列淸楚。什麼大小仿宋，大小方體，大小楷書，以及長的，扁的，細的，粗的，各種持製字模，不下三十餘種。另外也還有西文各種字模，總計大小字模，當在十餘萬個以上。有的是用得最繁的，有的是備而不用的。據瞿無雙說：每天澳出的紛字，當在五十萬個以上。因爲他們每天的報紙上，就要用到四十多萬個字，所以每天澆出五十多萬個字，恰巧供一天之用。還多澆十萬字，好像常備兵之外的預備兵了。』吳君素道：「阿喲！」天澆出五十萬個鉛字，十天就要五白萬個，一百天便要五千萬個，那裏有許多架子撬呢？」瞿無雙笑道；「君素姊！你所見的是那些小印刷所的排字房，他們也不必每天澆道們多字。他們把拆下來的版子，一個個鉛字，仍舊還到架子上去。但此地却不然，鉛字不必再還到架升上去，版子拆卸下來，當天一律回爐。這有兩個意義：第一，不必將鉛字還到架子上去，是省時間，省工夫。從前排字房還字一項工作，向來歸　徒做的。但藝徒近來有別樣工作，而且時間就是經濟，可省就要省了。二則，回爐重鑄以後，每天都用的是新字，決不有糢糊不淸之弊了。所以君素姊怕鉛字太多，架上擺不下，那成爲杞人之憂了。」從鑄字房到澆版處，澆版處與紙版處，平列兩大間。因爲這是互相聯絡的，務必取其便當。原來每一版的鉛字排好後，就送到紙版處。紙版處有好幾架打紙版機器，都是用高壓力的水壓引擎。鉛字版上了架子，原紙版也挿人機內，扳動引擎，利用水力，便往下壓。不到兩分鐘，便將紙版抽出，而且不須烘烤，取出來就乾燥。這是爲什麼？因爲鉛字版排好，打紙版，再澆鉛版，這其間，正是報館中最緊張時間。可以越快越好，能省上分時間，就省上分時間。　（二五三）</p>

<p>㳺藝界南洋片商談　「時裝片」與「古裝片」  海星　　與其不關痛癢的古裝片　何如有意識的時事影片　　　　本　刊十九日發表一篇「關於國片的建議」後，已引起一般人的注意，可見此一問題，確有相當重要性。　　茲有日前抵滬的南洋片商吳君，對此發表意見，並談及國片在南洋一帶之近况，特爲記出，俾作國片製作者之製片參考。吳君云。。以前，國片在南洋的銷路首推　　武俠片　所謂武俠片的武術，自然遠不如美國的西部影片，不過，僑胞對國片總特別感到親切，於是趨之若在。其後粵語片也一度盛行，那是因爲僑胞大抵爲粵閩人士，方言上易於瞭解。而八一三後，國語的古裝片逐漸抬頭，現在已有雄居首席之勢。考其原因，（一）由於近年來華僑學校都有國語敎授，加以中央電台每天都有國語廣播，所以僑胞對國語都已不再感到陌生了，（二）國語片所費的成本較大，無論佈景服裝道具以及技術方面，都遠勝過粵語片，所以它能得到歡迎，不過僑胞所要求的，是有骨子的歷史上的人物作爲主角的　　古裝片　換句話說，是假古人之口，說今人之言的有含蓄的作品，單靠一套古裝的形式而想吸引觀衆，那是不容易的。所以此後希望國片的製作者，能同時注意到古裝片的內容，吾則，古裝片之被僑胞厭惡恐怕爲期不遠了。記者詢以時裝片果不受歡迎乎？答曰：「這也不一定，據我看來，若有一部有骨子的針對時事的　　時裝片　不但一樣可以賣錢，或許會超過一些不關痛癢的古裝片。不過片商們不敢冒險嘗試，對時裝片的拷貝，售價極力壓低，製片公司同樣拍片子，自然就不願拍時裝片了。我的意見，拍古裝片不能單注意一個形式，同時，希望有一家公司能冒險嘗試一部時裝片，那倒是一條新路呢。」（遊藝界的生力軍　上海將有馬戲班出演　—地點在大華路相近  遊記者　　自　從海京伯馬戲班在上海一度獻技後，對於這留有粗綫姿態的技術新刺激，特別是廣多的牲畜猛獸，更引起了都會士女的愛好，可是馬戲班班子旣少，開支也相當浩大，因此，許多年來，上海就沒有繼海京伯而來的馬戲班。　　不久以前，天一影片公司的邵醉翁和曁南影片公司的黃槐生兩君曾經向國外邀請了一環球馬戲班一來滬獻技，嗣以條件未妥而停擱，也許上海還不失爲一個「冒險家的樂園」，故黃槐生在南洋鉅商東松根君的支持和合作下，對於這一個計劃已經進展得具體化了，不過，邵醉翁業已退出，另外還有戚文華等幾人合作。　　「環球馬戲班」大的在四月中旬抵滬，陣容技術相當可觀，現在陳黃兩君已經在接洽出演的塲地，據說地點是戈登路大華路的附近，自己打樣建造獸園和會塲，如是地址洽妥，這在上海遊藝辦又將多一粗綫一條的新奇刺激的玩意兒了。上海花樣眞多，仕女們的眼福不淺，但天堂的背面和內層自然還有一片地獄的慘象呢紀慈善舞藝會　　桑梅史舞校，假座蘭心戲院，舉行一九四〇年慈善舞藝會消息，已誌前戰，茲悉大會節目，非常精彩，其中允以梅蓀女士之歌舞，出神入化，動人心弦，維也納華爾滋舞，係由意大利美麗少女參加表演。服裝極華麗絢爛之至，此外如裘恩桑梅史之夏威夷舞，精嫻美妙，使觀衆恍如置身島國，益以著名樂隊，伴奏古典樂爵士樂等，尤使聽者神往，益爲大會生色。會期爲明日廿三日及廿五廿六三天，票資悉數撥助天佑會主辦之救濟中國工廠女工生活費用，允爲難能可貴、救難大會中之華容道  愚厂　　游藝救難大會京百開演之第六日，鄙人以同事許君承緒亦加入演唱華容道，二時許亟驅車往新世界，唯途决私忖與許君共事十數載，從未見伊上紅氍毺唱京班戲，且華容道又爲紅生吃重劇，初决玩票，得母欲出岔子乎？頗爲許君憂。不意屆時許君上塲，其成績竟有出人意表者，試漫爲評述如次：頭塲出塲，亮相威武嚴肅，即博得滿堂彩聲，蓋許君扮相個兒，處處深合我人理想中之關公，此剧最爲適宜。予友王君劍章在座謂予曰，此君乃天生唱關公戲的良材，不知同樂社係何處覓得？可見唱此戲人材之稀也。以下原腔要腔處，扳得極慢，深得唱之訣門，與關平周倉三人一齊動作之身段，甚是整齊好看，坐帳傳令之際，臉上表情，身上動作，均臻純熟之境。與曹操對唱快板，亦殊流利，所惜者底氣稍欠充沛，致唱時不甚響亮，苟能勤加調嗓，調鬥遂漸加長，庶幾可免此憾，我友解人，或不以此言爲河漢乎介绍中国影訉　　今日出版　　籌備多時之電影權威刊物「中國影訊」，今日出版，消息獨特，圖文並茂，爲本年度最優秀之週刊。金城，滬光，新光三大戲院及郵政信箱六七二號，均可定閱，全年只收兩元，得有贈戲券，明星照片，參觀拍戲，列席影星座談會等權利之享受，可謂實惠之至。梨園外紀  徐慕雲　　南方之琴鼓聖手（下）　　雨　田訪得趙氏之名後，乃親往其寓造訪三次，嵩綬固亦久耳大瑣（雨田小宇）之名，當然一見投緣，凡梅有請益處，無不盡心指授，從此二竟成契友。其後老譚南來，因演「八大鎚」「鎭搜州」未帶小生，而竟强小廉爲配劇中之陸文龍，楊再興者，實梅慫恿之力，冀增嵩綬父子之聲譽耳。其實小康乃武生行，並非長於武小生劇者，譚氏破格延用，亦向所未有之奇聞也。又滬上有琴師陳阿金者，藝名振一時，與嵩綬之鼓，號爲雙絕，會在桂芬某年來滬，其琴師因病不能操琴？班主遂薦阿金爲代，汪大頭自以爲其藝無敵，况其唱腔，有非他人所能托襯得宜者，故先存卑視阿金之心理。迨彼登塲後，方唱某段慢板，而琴絃忽斷，此際不特大頭着忙，以目頻視阿金，大露小快之意，即全體塲面上人以及後台管事等莫不爲阿金握一把汗，殊知阿金反異常鎮定，行若無事，竟用下把操單絃（即一根絃）將此段吿終，劇畢後阿金向大頭道歉，在亟笑迎一之曰：「今日始知汝琴藝之高，眞名不虛傳矣」。按曩年著名琴師，上台時祗隨身携帶一琴，無座旁另置一琴者，且斷絃之事，不常聞之，說者謂阿金旣稱江南名手，焉有如此巧合之舉，豈彼故折一絃，以眩其能乎？年　代遠，殆無人能證其眞僞矣。</p>

With strong units cutting off their retreat and launching attacks from all sides, inflicting heavy casualties, the remaining Japanese forces are trapped in a tight encirclement. Unable to advance or retreat, the Japanese troops launched a fierce assault on the morning of the 20th, attempting to break out of the encirclement. However, they were bravely intercepted by Chinese forces, resulting in hundreds of Japanese deaths and failure to break through. Chinese troops are now narrowing the encirclement, exerting intense pressure. (Dispatch of the 21st)</p>

<p>Chongqing – A Chinese military spokesperson stated today that the Japanese military operations in South China are extremely foolish. When their main forces attacked Lingshan last week, they left the Yongqin Highway, which they considered to be the most important to defend, in a state of defensive emptiness. This provided the Chinese guerillas with the best opportunity to launch surprise attacks. The Japanese attack on Lingshan was intended to eliminate the Chinese guerilla base threatening the Yongqin Highway and ensure its safety. However, in carrying out this mission, the Japanese deployed a large force, leaving the Japanese defense forces on the Yongqin Highway overly weak. Therefore, during the Japanese attack on Lingshan, the Chinese guerillas on the Yongqin Highway were also at their most active. The Japanese transport teams on the highway suffered the most damage from the Chinese at this time. According to the Chinese military spokesperson, the Japanese attack on Lingshan was carried out in several directions. By the end of last week, they had approached Lingshan and entered the town on Sunday, engaging in fierce street fighting with Chinese troops. Since Sunday, the Chinese side has not received any telegrams from that location. However, it is expected that Chinese and Japanese forces are currently still engaged in a stalemate in the southern, northwestern, and eastern suburbs of Lingshan. The spokesperson also stated that strong Chinese units are currently attacking the rear of the Japanese forces. Most notably, Yongchun, 40 miles east of Nanning, has been recaptured by Chinese forces, indicating that the rear of the attacking forces on Lingshan has been cut off. In short, the Japanese army's inability to secure its lines of communication is the fatal wound in every battle fought by the Japanese army in South China. The spokesperson further stated that the Japanese troops attacking Lingshan had originally advanced to a point 12 miles east of Lingshan, but were fiercely attacked by the Chinese forces and forced to retreat towards Lingshan. Finally, the spokesperson stated that the Japanese army in South China may still harbor the ambition of opening up the Guangdong-Guangxi line of defense. The Japanese are now increasing their forces in the Guangzhou area, possibly in preparation for connecting the Nanning war zone along the river. However, their forces are limited and not sufficient to accomplish this. (United Press dispatch of the 21st)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Fragments of Japanese Commentary</h3>
<p>The Japanese are by no means a base and foolish nation. Nor is the predicament Japan finds itself in today in political, economic and international terms a result of baseness and foolishness. Japan has no unique culture, and Japan has not made much contribution to human civilization. However, Japan has been able to catch up rapidly in every era, able to approach the standard of contemporary culture. Japan's current situation, in the evolutionary process of that nation, is in fact a temporary reversal, and the responsibility lies with a distortedly developed class within that nation. Therefore, as far as the entire Japanese nation is concerned, not only is it unnecessary to regard it as hateful, but it is also quite worthy of compassion. Although the distorted development of a class should be borne by the entire Japanese nation in terms of cause, and its retribution must be shared by the entire Japanese nation in terms of result, it can only be judged as being caused by the fact that the entire nation is not yet sound. There is no need to make ruthless accusations against the entire nation hastily.</p>
<p>The above concept is neither an intuition nor an arbitrary judgment. I believe that abundant evidence and material can be used to illustrate it, which cannot be elaborated on in this short article. The reason for stating this concept is that at this time when Japan is deeply mired on the wrong path, it is difficult to reverse the accumulation of problems, justice is buried, and national spirit is depressed. Occasionally, I hear some comments from the Japanese side, and I cannot help but feel endless emotion in my heart. Therefore, I have raised the concept to serve as a premise for my emotion. What are the comments? Yesterday, several newspapers in Tokyo commented on their budget proposal of 1.5 billion yen for the next year. When the budget proposal was submitted to the parliament by the cabinet, the entire house was silent, and it was passed in a bleak silence. It is clear that there is no possibility of faithful implementation, yet the cabinet put it forward and the parliament approved it. This is almost a solid argument that can be taken as a basis for re-evaluating the Japanese nation, and it is shocking and reprehensible. After the passage, the newspapers finally commented on it with uneasy silence, the words were euphemistic, the meaning sarcastic, the heart was painful, and what was revealed was mournful and haggard. However, what the budget proposal showed should only be used as a basis for evaluating those who rashly proposed it and silently supported it; it is certainly not appropriate to use it to evaluate the entire nation, as evidenced by several newspapers. This is one aspect. We do not want to comment on the case of Saito Takao, a member of the Japanese House of Representatives, because although Saito's remarks at the time were widely circulated after the fact, what was circulated was a record that had been revised and deleted by order of the speaker. With a changed appearance, it must have lost its true colors, so there is no way to know whether Saito's central consciousness was a faithful but unwelcome warning to that distorted class, or was it to cater to the distorted class in order to seek glory and incur humiliation. A few days after the Saito case, there was Yonaiyama Tsuneo, who had accumulated labor in the Japanese diplomatic service and had risen to the level of consul. He had resided in China for thirty years. Given the strictness of Japan's promotion and selection system, those who accumulate qualifications to become consul are not ordinary people. However, because he wrote an article entitled "The Basis for Handling the Incident," published in the February issue of the authoritative Japanese magazine "Diplomatic Times," the diplomatic authorities were afraid that the gist of his argument would violate the intentions of the distorted class and might not be able to avoid causing a verbal prison and implicate superiors, so they quickly dismissed him from his post, hoping to lighten the guilt. Yonaiyama's article questioned the inappropriateness of the authorities' handling of the so-called China Incident, saying that he had thought and worried to the point of extreme distress. He was confident that he had studied China and understood China deeply. He used the words of former Japanese Prime Minister Abe, "This China Incident, although called an incident, is actually the greatest war in Japan's history," as the thread running through the beginning and end of the article. He revealed that Japan was treating this unprecedented foreign war as a domestic incident, and was trying to deal with it casually with one-sided regulations, which was the fundamental contradiction and fallacy of the Japanese authorities. He said: "All Chinese people who are worried and determined and aware, when they hear the Konoe statement, regard it as a meaningless expression"; Japan's "millions of banners, supporting the Konoe statement, are nothing more than cheering for China's victory" ; Regarding the time to resolve the China Incident, Japan initially said it would take two months, then changed to say that a quick victory would take one year, and then changed to say that it would be a long-term war, even saying that it would take a hundred years of war; China, from the beginning, did not regard this as a simple incident, but as a war between two countries. It is a national war, so it decided on long-term resistance from the beginning; it wishes to see the existence of the two nations, and knows that China will never be subdued by Japan, because China has had this kind of awareness from the beginning" ; If Japan "does not achieve results, it is a failure; even temporary victories or partial victories are no different from total failure." He said that during the January 28 Incident, the Japanese army occupied Jiading but did not attack Kunshan and Suzhou because the Japanese military authorities at the time said "they feared being lured into the endless depths by Chinese strategy, getting trapped in the mud and unable to extricate themselves." So they resolved the situation peacefully with the Songhu Agreement; the implication is that he is worried and resentful that today they have actually entered the endless depths and cannot extricate themselves, but he did not openly express this regret. He said that he saw with his own eyes the extremely difficult transportation and marching of the Japanese army in the very short distance between Shanghai and Jiading; "the Chinese are as light and fast as flying birds, carrying only a small amount of weapons and ammunition, and can strongly resist", "Japan must carry a large amount of weapons, ammunition, food, fodder, and all living materials for marching. Yonai explored the traces of Chinese history, the origins of governance, a long article with great depth; the main point is to directly slap the face of the East Asian Co-prosperity Sphere, and to expose the fallacy of Japan's current policy; All of the above is only one or two hundredths of the original text, and does not fully capture its essence. In short, the fact that there are such papers in Japan today at least proves that the entire Japanese nation is not base and foolish. This is another aspect. Yesterday, United Press Tokyo also reported the words of Matsumoto, a reporter for the Japanese Diplomatic Times, saying that "the National Government has countless Chinese people, and most of the Chinese people are anti-Japanese," "It is a mistake to say that the strength of the National Government is weak. Although there have been disputes between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, they are not as serious as reported by Japanese newspapers." He is also Japanese, and can use a calm mind and accurate observation to give the Japanese optimists a ruthless blow to the head. This is yet another aspect.</p>
<p>In the past, we sincerely hoped that the Japanese side could restore reason as soon as possible, worry about the changes in the world, and feel compassion for the people, so we could not help but expect such a foolish thing. But with the gift of time, and now, we are gradually hearing about Yonai, Matsumoto, and so on. Although their views and arguments are not fully accepted by us, the minority of enlightened views cannot be regarded as representing the views of the entire Japanese nation; and under their policy of suppressing speech, it is difficult to hope that it will penetrate into the people and promote effectiveness; but what we have heard recently is what we did not hear in the past. Seeing that the authorities in charge of the important tasks of the country during the war are talking about political cooperation and peaceful promotion, we know that the morale of the Japanese soldiers and the hearts of the people will be more difficult to go to war; seeing that their financial resources are difficult and the budget is difficult to implement, we know that the Japanese aggressive military will not be able to maintain it; seeing that the theory of moderation is gradually showing signs, and the enlightened generation may gradually decide to raise their eyebrows, we know that the expectation of Japan's restoration of reason is not a foolish wish; but then the distorted class, although it wants to cover up the dawn with one hand and make the Far East dark for a long time, will not be allowed by the general trend; otherwise, the time for that class to wake up is not far away...</p>
<h3>US Senate Loan Committee Passes Bill to Suspend Silver Purchase; No Impact on Existing Contracts</h3>
<p>New York – The Senate Silver Currency Committee today passed the Thomson Bill to suspend silver purchases by a vote of fourteen to four. The bill is now sent to the Senate with the Committee's approval report on the suspension. The bill prohibits the purchase of foreign silver under the 1934 Silver Purchase Act and abolishes the 50% tax on silver bar transfers. However, the bill does not prevent limited foreign silver purchases under previous authority or by the Exchange Stabilization Fund Act, nor does it affect existing contracts. According to this contract, the United States can continue to purchase 16 million ounces of silver from Canada and China, but Mexican silver will be purchased in small amounts. Since this bill has been approved by a majority of the committee, it is expected that both the Senate and the House of Representatives will pass it during this session.

<h3>US Ambassador to Japan Grew Will Retire</h3>
<p>Tokyo – Japanese newspapers today prominently published unconfirmed reports about the US Ambassador to Japan, Grew, retiring from the diplomatic service this summer. Although reporters were unable to obtain immediate comments on the news from officials at the US Embassy in Japan, reliable sources say that Grew has no intention of resigning. Japanese newspapers claim that Grew wants to retire because he believes "a new and younger ambassador is more likely to adjust US-Japan relations." The Japanese newspaper also stated that Grew will visit Nanjing and Chongqing this summer, and then return to Washington to announce his retirement. Sources familiar with the matter denied that Grew intended to request a transfer to the US government, but they indicated that he may still enjoy his usual summer vacation this summer. It is generally recalled that when Grew returned to his post from Washington last year, he made a frank speech to the Japanese people, which surprised the Japanese diplomatic community that day. Grew said at the time that "the American people do know the meaning of Japan's East Asian New Order," but they do not like the movement promoted by Japan. (United Press dispatch of the 21st)</p>
<h3>Romania Denies Demobilization Luo Jing</h3>
<p>According to a Romanian spokesperson today, the recent claim by the Minister of Agriculture that personnel needed for farmland will soon be demobilized is incorrect. The maximum number of troops Romania can demobilize is only 100,000. If we receive guarantees from other countries that they will not attack Romania in the future, we may consider further demobilization. As for the current work in the fields, it can be done by the elderly and children. The government must closely monitor the current international situation. (Reuter, 21st)</p>

<p>British Reply to Italy Explains Blockade Policy Inspection Methods Arise from Wartime Necessity The Interests of Neutral Countries Will Still Be Respected</p>
<p>London Regarding the case of Italian ships being detained by the British Navy for carrying German coal, the Italian government submitted a note to the British government on the 4th of this month, protesting the general blockade policy. The British government immediately issued a reply to defend its position. The case has been satisfactorily resolved. The government has now published the reply to clarify the details of the negotiation. It stated: The country's government faces a country that disregards all principles of international law and common humanitarian regulations. Therefore, when implementing international law, we must also consider this fact. In other words, if our country strictly adheres to international law while the enemy is not bound by it, the result will inevitably put our country at an extremely disadvantageous position in the war. However, our government has no intention of imitating the barbaric methods used by the enemy (referring to the treatment suffered by the ships of Italy and other neutral countries). When implementing inspections in the western Mediterranean, we have already made every effort to meet the requirements of your country and the governments of various neutral countries, taking various measures to minimize the hindrance to merchant ships of various countries. In the eastern Mediterranean, special accommodating measures have also been stipulated to ensure that merchant ships of various countries do not experience excessive delays during inspection. The government of your country stated in this note that the various measures taken by our government are sufficient to hinder the current political and economic relations between Italy and our country, that is, the relations established by the Anglo-Italian agreement of April 16, 1938. We cannot agree with this. Our government still attaches great importance to this agreement and considers it an important factor in stabilizing the political structure of the Mediterranean. Now, it is said that the effectiveness of this agreement has been hindered by our government's implementation of belligerent rights. Our government is truly regrettable. At the beginning of the war, our government made every effort to solicit the opinions of your country's authorities in order to eliminate various reasons that could cause dissatisfaction. In short, the legal inspection methods implemented by our government are necessary for the continuation of the war. The government of our country will continue to give the greatest respect to the interests of your country and various neutral countries, provided that they do not conflict with the implementation of these measures. This determination can be affirmed to the heavens. If the government of your country still cannot trust us after receiving the reply, then this reply will be equivalent to a mere formality, which is a pity. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>German Government Establishes Ordnance Department</p>
<p>Berlin The German government has appointed Dr. Todt as the Minister of Ordnance. According to Haitong News Agency, he will continue to concurrently serve as the Director-General of German Highways and the Commissioner for Special Issues of the Four-Year Plan. Todt is famous for building highways and the Siegfried Line. Political figures here believe that his appointment as Minister of Ordnance is clear proof that foreign rumors about Germany's peace plan are unfounded. German people believe that the European war will enter a new stage. It is currently difficult to determine whether the Ordnance Department will have a deputy minister. (Haitong, 21st)</p>

<p>Moscow Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, and Finnish representatives Paasikivi and Väyrynen, exchanged the ratification documents of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty and annexes at the Kremlin yesterday.

<p>Helsinki After the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty was sealed by both governments, Molotov and Paasikivi exchanged the treaty texts on behalf of the Soviet and Finnish sides today. It is reported that after the Finnish representatives arrived in Moscow last night, the representatives of both sides had a detailed discussion on the treaty. The discussion on the implementation of the treaty provisions continued this morning, and it is expected that it will take several days to fully agree. At that time, the two countries are expected to restore normal diplomatic relations. Regarding trade issues, although the two sides have reached an agreement in principle, the Finnish government still needs to send a commercial delegation to Moscow to discuss the details. However, according to reports, the representatives of both sides will not insist on their own opinions and cause disputes. In addition to Molotov, the Soviet representatives also include Stalinov and Barkov. Barkov is the Director of the Baltic Department of the Soviet Foreign Affairs Committee, which shows that the Soviet Union believes that Finland is indeed one of the Baltic Sea coastal countries. (Haitong, 20th)</p>
<p>Stockholm A Moscow dispatch from a local newspaper stated that the Soviet side has now expanded its demands on Finland. During the first meeting in Moscow between Soviet authorities and Finnish representatives to initial the peace treaty, the Soviet side stated that the previously proposed boundary line must be moved slightly westward in some places than previously expected. The Finnish representatives knew that there was no way to resist and had no choice but to agree. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Helsinki On the highway leading to Viipuri, the Soviet-Finnish border has been marked by Finns establishing barrier lines. Soviet troops stopped advancing twenty feet outside the boundary. The new border positions are now guarded by Finnish soldiers. A Reuters correspondent returning from the new border line in the east stated that he personally witnessed the main road still being blocked by refugees at times. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Stockholm According to the former Finnish Prime Minister, the Finnish losses in the Soviet-Finnish war included 15,000 deaths, 30,000 wounded, and 500,000 homeless. The number of towns and villages attacked by Soviet aircraft was 370, the number of completely destroyed hospitals was 46, and the number of completely destroyed churches was 4. Soviet aircraft carried out 1,823 air raids, dropping 64,000 bombs. (Reuter, 20th)</p>
<p>London It is reported that the Soviet government has declared its opposition to the proposed Scandinavian defense alliance. This statement surprised the Finnish and Swedish sides. The foreign ministers of the two countries have issued statements stating that the purpose of this alliance is only to prevent aggression and is not aimed at any country. The Stockholm side hopes to obtain a plan that can be approved by the Soviet Union. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>London It is reported that the Soviet TASS news agency has issued a statement stating that the defense alliance treaty to be concluded by Finland, Sweden, and Norway is aimed at the Soviet Union, so the Soviet Union expressed its opposition. Political figures here were displeased but not surprised. It is generally believed that any plan that strengthens the defense capabilities of the Scandinavian peninsula will be opposed by the Soviet Union, which was expected. However, it remains to be seen whether Finland, Sweden, and Norway will respect the will of the Soviet Union. In short, Sweden and Norway once encouraged Finland to accept Soviet conditions, and today they can learn a lesson from the Soviet Union's attitude. (Havas, 20th)</p>

<p>Sylt Island Air Raid Report British Aviation Minister Report in the House of Commons</p>
<p>London Aviation Minister Wood replied in the House of Commons this afternoon to questions about the raid on Hörnum on the German island of Sylt, stating that British Air Force aircraft continuously raided Hörnum last night for six hours. The place is the take-off point for German aircraft laying mines and attacking ships. The British aircraft carried out twenty attacks, which were a response to the German aircraft's attack on the Orkney Islands. The British aircraft dispatched were very strong, twice the number of German aircraft that came to attack on Saturday and Sunday. The weather was clear, and the moonlight was bright at the beginning of the air raid, but the sky turned faint near dawn. The enemy's fierce anti-aircraft fire failed to prevent British aircraft from reaching their destination and dropping a large number of bombs (the crowd cheered). German fighter aircraft avoided British machine gun fire and flew away. All British aircraft, except one, have returned safely. British aircraft dropped many tons of explosive bombs and incendiary bombs at high and low altitudes during the raid. According to reports from pilots, the ground damage was severe. The enemy's aircraft hangar was hit and burned, and the oil storage tanks also caught fire. The wharf, light railway, and other parts of the base were hit. British aircraft flew to investigate this morning and were able to observe the island despite enemy attacks, confirming the success of the air raid (the crowd cheered). British aircraft have now returned to defense. The British Air Force is very happy to have this opportunity to show its skills and is becoming more and more excited. This action once again demonstrated the British Air Force's team leaders and pilots' combat spirit and technology, as well as their willingness and readiness to serve. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>London After the Minister of Defense Coordination, Lord Chatfield, reported on the raid on the German island of Sylt in the House of Lords last night, House of Lords member Lord Strabolgi claimed that the bombs dropped by British aircraft during the attack on Sylt Island were more than the bombs dropped by German aircraft during the attack on London during the last war. He expressed his admiration for the British aircraft's actions. The civilians on Sylt Island have already been evacuated, so the island is a good target because everything on the island has military value. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>London The British were overjoyed and encouraged by the complete victory of the concentrated air raid on the German North Sea base. However, officials issued warnings, saying that the large-scale air raids of mutual destruction between Britain and Germany were just beginning, which greatly disappointed the general public. According to the Ministry of Aviation, the result of the reconnaissance flight of British aircraft over the German island of Sylt showed that the German air force base there was severely damaged, indicating that the British air raid had indeed achieved a complete victory. However, it was reported that just as the good news of the raid on Sylt Island was announced in the House of Commons, and the people in the House of Commons were cheering, the Secretary of the Navy, Churchill, immediately mentioned the German air raid on Scapa Flow and warned the public, saying, "We have to anticipate that air raids of this nature will become commonplace in the future, and we must do our best to retaliate." According to well-informed sources, large-scale fierce air battles are about to occur. The British side anticipates that German aircraft will launch large-scale air raids at sea and is prepared to take extraordinary measures to defend by attacking. It is also reported that the number of bombers dispatched by the British side this time was between 20 and 50, and the bombing time lasted for 7 hours. Sylt Island, outside the border of Denmark, was filled with flames and became a terrifying hell (International News Agency, 21st).</p>
<p>London According to a dispatch from Copenhagen, smoke was still rising from the German island of Sylt until yesterday evening after the large-scale raid by British aircraft, indicating that the houses were still burning. According to a dispatch from Mid-Island in Denmark, north of Sylt Island, the railway line along the Denge water gate is likely to have been damaged, because normally four trains a day pass through the gate, but no trains passed yesterday. According to responsible sources here, two British reconnaissance aircraft that flew to Holland this morning to observe the damage after the attack encountered shore-based fire when flying over Sylt Island. The fire was very dense in several places, and they encountered two Mauser-Schmidt 109 German fighter aircraft, but the German aircraft failed to attack the British aircraft. According to the detailed reports received so far, the British aircraft successfully and accurately attacked Hörnum. Despite the dense anti-aircraft fire, the British aircraft still dropped bombs from various target altitudes. Although the searchlights around the bombed targets were all turned on, only a few British bombers were illuminated by the lights. In one stage of the air raid, one British aircraft only had to deal with one searchlight, and the other lights had been "extinguished" by the preceding aircraft. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>New York This news paper reported in large letters the news of the British Air Force's attack on Hörnum on the German island of Sylt. The New York Times stated that this seemed to be a thorough handling of the incident, which was done in retaliation for the German aircraft's attack on Scapa Flow. More than ten British aircraft went to bomb the enemy's land, and according to British reports, only one aircraft did not return. The strength of the British aircraft group can be seen from this. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Berlin A reporter from Haitong News Agency recently learned from responsible military sources that the situation during the British aircraft's air raid on Sylt Island was as follows: The air raid started at 8:00 p.m. and continued until 2:50 a.m., during which it flew out of the island's airspace several times. The number of aircraft was approximately between 15 and 20. The accurate shooting of the German anti-aircraft artillery team prevented the British aircraft from achieving military success. Most of the bombs landed in the sea and sparsely populated areas. Only one empty house was bombed. Only two people were injured by shrapnel, and there were no other losses. (Haitong, 21st)</p>
<p>Danish Government Protests to the UK Netherlands Denies British Aircraft Flew over Airspace</p>
<p>Copenhagen The semi-official Ritzau News Agency recently issued a message stating that British aircraft invaded our country's airspace on the west coast of the Jude Gate Bay of our country when flying to bomb the German island of Sylt yesterday and today and dropped several bombs. This action violated our country's neutrality. The government ordered the Minister to the UK to protest to the British government. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>London According to the Danish Berlingske newspaper, several bombs dropped by central aircraft in the Wivelst, a town near Lyngeby in Denmark, caused more severe damage than initially reported. The walls of the houses were completely destroyed, and the furniture, doors, and windows were shattered. A wooden house was also destroyed. Four bombs also fell on the Danish island of Fanø, and one fell near Toftlund on the west of Jutland. It is reported that the aircraft that dropped the bombs on Fanø was the aircraft that was previously reported to have caught fire and crashed in the central part of the island. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Amsterdam The Dutch News Agency recently issued a statement saying, "According to a message issued by the German semi-official German News Agency, British aircraft flew over Dutch airspace when they went to bomb Sylt Island in Germany. This statement was recently denied by responsible persons in our country, because according to the report of our country's air defense team, foreign aircraft did not invade our country's airspace."

<p>Special Air Defense Organization in German Military Region Does Not Shoot Down British Reconnaissance Aircraft to Avoid Exposing Special Characteristics</p>
<p>Stockholm A dispatch According to a report by the famous Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet on the first of this month, commenting on "Why does the anti-aircraft artillery not open fire when British reconnaissance aircraft fly over?" According to air defense experts, the air defense of each German military region has a special and different organization. Regardless of the anti-aircraft artillery, searchlights, and other facilities, each one is the same and can become the Siegfried Line in the air when necessary. The German authorities obviously do not want to expose these characteristics to the outside world and let the enemy know. Therefore, even if British reconnaissance aircraft fly over Berlin, they do not open fire. Secondly, the German air defense authorities know that attacking one or two reconnaissance aircraft will result in artillery fragments flying everywhere, which will cause no small losses to the industrial center. Therefore, it was decided that before enemy aircraft launch a large-scale bombing of Germany, the air defense facilities will not be released. (Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>Difficult to Implement Japanese Budget Plan Japanese Newspapers Comment</p>
<p>Tokyo The total amount of the next fiscal year's budget bill will reach 15 billion yen. After it is passed by the parliament, the Asahi Shimbun recently commented that there will be three major difficulties in implementing this budget. First, the government has not yet formulated a specific plan for the mobilization of raw materials. Therefore, the actual number of items and raw materials that can be requisitioned, and the cost of these goods, are not known with certainty. When implementing this budget, it will be necessary to prepare another budget in addition to the expenses that have already been approved by the parliament, and then stipulate a smaller amount of expenditure that can be in line with the original budget bill. Second, this budget will inevitably cause malignant inflation due to the need to spend a large amount of currency. Therefore, the government must try to economize to avoid causing serious impact. Third, commodity prices are soaring so much that although the government has tried its best to suppress them, if commodity prices continue to rise at the rate of the past few months, it will inevitably be difficult to implement this budget. Due to these three unfavorable factors, the government will either be forced to spend reserves or substantially reduce this budget. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that this budget was originally prepared by the Abe Cabinet and is not perfect. The current cabinet does not seem likely to implement it according to the amount specified in this budget. However, since the budget is so large, even if it is greatly economized during implementation, it will not only be difficult to provide financial support, but also the goal of 120 million yen for the national savings campaign will be difficult to achieve in full due to soaring commodity prices and the people's difficulty in making a living. The nationalist National News stated that inappropriate economic theories, no matter how pleasant they sound, must be discarded. At this moment, the government should vigorously implement compulsory purchase of public bonds and force capitalists to absorb public bonds. It should be known that the skills of bureaucratic politics have always been to impose exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies on the people, which is difficult to escape blame. Those who use war to absorb profits and become nouveau riche are everywhere, but the authorities do not impose heavy taxes on them, which is even more wrong. It is hoped that the current government will follow the financial measures of the German National Socialist government and confiscate war profits. (Havas, 19th)</p>

<p>Japan Makes Demands to Macau Authorities</p>
<p>Hong Kong According to reliable sources, the Japanese side is putting pressure on the Portuguese authorities of Macau Island. Rumors say that Japan has made four demands to the Macau authorities, as follows: (1) Macau Island is protected by Japan, so it is not disturbed by Chinese "bandits." Therefore, Macau Island should pay Japan 400,000 Hong Kong dollars per month. (2) Expel anti-Japanese elements. (3) Allow the Japanese side to send personnel to search house by house together with the police on the island. (4) Allow Japanese military currency to circulate on the island.

<p>Li Shutang Commits Suicide to Show His Determination</p>
<p>Zhongyang According to reports, Li Shutang, a local gentleman from Zhongyang, was unwilling to submit to Japan and committed suicide by taking poison this spring. According to reports, Li was 60 years old and had served as the head of the Shanxi Police Department and the head of the Public Security Bureau of Taiyuan for many years. After the July 7th Incident, he returned to his hometown from Taiyuan. After Zhongyang fell, Li led his family to flee to the countryside. The Japanese ordered the puppet county government to send police to search villages and arrest Li, forcing Li to return to the county and take a puppet position. Li was unwilling to submit to Japan and secretly hid for two years. Last year, he lived near Wolonggang in the suburbs, and was discovered by the puppet county government, which forcibly ordered him to return to the city. Mizushima, the Japanese advisor to the puppet county government, insisted on forcing Li to take a puppet position. Li had a straightforward personality and refused sternly. Later, he was forced by the Japanese and had no choice but to commit suicide by taking poison. (21st)</p>

<p>Import of Foreign Rice Uninterrupted Abundant Grain Reserves in Shanghai Authorities Negotiate to Continue Selling Flour at Low Prices The People's Food Regulation Association Raises Large Sums of Money</p>
<p>Since the noodle industry in this city stopped supplying low-priced flour on the 30th of this month, it has appealed to the Public Works Department to negotiate with the two flour mills, Fuxin and Fufeng, in this city to request the continued supply of low-priced flour. The Public Works Department believes that stopping the supply of low-priced flour will have a profound impact on the people's food supply. It immediately contacted the two flour mills. It is reported that Fufeng Mill has made an informal expression of supplying 5,000 bags per day. However, due to the recent increase in the cost of manufacturing flour, it will suffer losses if it continues to supply it at the previous price of 10 yuan and 3 jiao. Therefore, the price per bag can be resolved immediately. However, the opinions of the two parties are now gradually approaching, or a solution can be found between 12 yuan and 13 yuan. As for the new mill, it has been shut down recently due to some reasons, so there may be problems in continuing in the short term. From the 22nd to the 25th of this month is the Jesus Easter holiday. The Public Works Department believes that it is a routine holiday, so the results of its negotiations will be announced on the 27th.</p>
<p>The People's Food Association Raises Large Sums of Money</p>
<p>The Shanghai People's Food Regulation Association, with the purpose of regulating the people's food in this city, has ordered 18 batches of foreign rice since it handled group rice purchases, totaling more than 50,000 bags. Twelve batches have already arrived in Shanghai. Except for the three batches in China, the remaining nine batches will also be collected one after another. As for the rice purchase funds, because fixed households only pay 20 yuan per bag of foreign currency, the financial situation is inevitably difficult. This meeting is specially raising money from the banking industry to make up for the situation. Also, when each bag of foreign rice is unloaded on the shore, a large number of "street angels" use iron rods to poke holes in the hemp bags of some bags of white rice in an attempt to obtain leaking rice. At a time when rice is as expensive as pearls, it is not necessary to take it seriously for these extremely poor people to plunder leaking rice by illegal means. However, if it is not stopped, it is feared that it will intensify, resulting in huge losses, which will hinder social order. Therefore, the association is applying to the concession police authorities to effectively assist in facilitating food regulation work.</p>
<p>Extreme Grain Panic in North China</p>
<p>The grain situation in North China is extremely panicked. The price of rice in Qingdao is 140 yuan per bag. However, the transfer to rescue is also controlled by the Japanese puppets. Everything must be obtained with a purchase certificate before it can be exported or imported. Even if there are those who transport it, it is actually a barter trade (that is, a certain amount of goods are shipped out of North China, and a certain amount of food is imported according to the ratio). Recently, the number of miscellaneous grains shipped to North China is considerable, but the exact number loaded by Japanese ships is not known. Now there is a British ship, Nanchang, which is going directly to Tianjin today, carrying 10,000 bags of foreign rice shipped from this city, which is sold by Dafu Foreign Company. Father Hunan Wheel is also scheduled to sail to North China today. In addition to 3,000 bags of foreign rice loaded in Hong Kong being shipped to Yantai on the original ship, Father loaded 6,000 bags of foreign rice and 1,000 bags of corn in this city and shipped them to Yantai. It is reported that Yingzhou Wheel has more than 6,000 bags of corn and more than 3,000 bags of foreign rice to Weihaiwei and is scheduled to export next Monday.</p>
<p>Abundant Grain Storage in Warehouses</p>
<p>As for the import of foreign rice, although there has been no large shipment of goods recently, the smaller numbers are coming in continuously. Yesterday, Taikoo Company's Guiyang Wheel arrived in Shanghai, carrying 4,660 bags of foreign rice from Qianluo and 781 bags from Hong Kong. Also, Hunan Wheel also imported yesterday, carrying 550 bags from Hong Kong. Shanghai's warehouses are still full of food and are extremely abundant. It is reported that a boat of rough rice will arrive in Shanghai within a few days. In addition to the production of Xijing area in West Shanghai, which is similar to Japanese rice, most of which is searched and purchased by the Japanese, the rest of the places can be released, but it is subject to control.</p>
<p>British Defense Zone in North Xizang Road Opens a Gap The British Army Can Restore the Blockade at Any Time The Defense Remains the Same Few Entrances and Exits</p>
<p>The British defense forces only opened a gap in the barbed wire in the "B" zone of North Xizang Road for the entry and exit of goods from the "Central Vegetable Market" of the other side. The British army also set up a new guard post at the "Market" Doukou, guarded by Scottish soldiers in shifts. The Fu Bureau of the Detective Room also sent Chinese and Western detectives to patrol and guard. However, the British army must reserve the right to blockade at any time. The British army's defense in other places remains the same. Zater Tan Zhi records the following:</p>
<p>Open a Gap</p>
<p>The area of North Xizang Road near the North Embankment of the New Garbage Bridge in the Public Concession was originally decided by the defense forces of various countries to be defended by the Scottish soldiers of the British Army. Now, the British Army authorities and the Public Works Department, because the pseudo "municipal government's" "Central Vegetable Market" will open on the morning of the 23rd, the Japanese Navy requested the opening of the "B" zone for the entry and exit of goods from the pseudo "market" without the need for a pass. After considering the results of the British Army and the Public Works Department, they stated that they must reserve the right to blockade at any time. At 9:30 a.m. yesterday, the Engineering Office of the Public Works Department sent workers to go there. With the approval of both parties, they only opened a gap in the barbed wire of the "B" zone, about 25 English feet wide, just in time to let the pseudo "market" door out.</p>
<p>Newly Built Guard Post</p>
<p>A reporter from Daguan Ji visited the site yesterday and saw that the newly opened gap was still surrounded by barbed wire on both sides. At the "Market" entrance, only people and goods from inside and outside the market were allowed to enter and exit. The traffic road around the foot of the surrounding wall has been cut off. The British army also set up a wooden red guard post in the center of the "Market" gate. A Scottish soldier stood there with a bayonet on his gun, determined to control the people entering and exiting the "Market" gap. Inside and outside the gap, there were also many Chinese and Western detectives sent by the Huisi Detective Room, guarding the New Garbage Bridge Embankment. The British army's posts remained unchanged. The iron gate at the Guangfu Road intersection was sealed as before. The "Market" gate was closed, and there were very few people entering and exiting.</p>
<p>Internal Situation</p>
<p>The site of the pseudo "market" is the original site of the Four Lines Warehouse. The warehouse houses will be used as the office of Pseudo Chang and a place to store goods. The place for setting up stalls for sale in the "market" is in the pre-built glass shed "market" patio. A new Japanese-style lookout post was built, with Japanese and puppet flags inserted on it. Two or three Japanese soldiers can stand in the post to watch. It is also learned that the "market" organization is a Japanese puppet cooperation "market." The Japanese Navy and puppet police will be stationed in various places inside the gate of the market to protect the work of the Japanese puppets. The flags of all nations have been divided and hung on the roof of the warehouse. The opening of the pseudo "market" will be held on the 23rd. At that time, the vegetables will be completely controlled by it, and it will be extremely harsh.</p>
<p>British Army Post</p>
<p>According to a British Army communiqué yesterday, it roughly stated that "Opening up the area of Tibet Road, at the entrance and exit bordering Zhabei and the concession, troops and police from both sides are stationed." A reporter from Daguang News Agency visited various places in the North District yesterday and saw the British Army's posts at the New Garbage Bridge Embankment, Kaifeng Road, Rehe Road, Haining Road, Early Bridge, and the end of Henan Road were still established as usual and had not moved. The opening was only a gap at the "Market" gate. However, the barbed wire along Bazilu in the Japanese military police area (from the entrance of Delong Tobacco Factory to North Jiangxi Road) has been moved to the middle of the road by the Japanese army. The market houses along the area north of the road have been occupied by the Japanese side, and the address of the Cantonese Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce Joint Association has been completely renovated to be used as the "Shanghai Taiwan Public Association First Address."</p>
<p>Local Banks Do Not Join</p>
<p>Although the "Central Market" organized by the Japanese puppets has decided to open, according to sources from the local goods industry, they are very unfamiliar with this matter. If the market can open and operate on schedule, local goods firms must send brokers to the market a few days ago to set up a measuring station. However, until now, Shangliu Shop's local goods firms have not heard of anyone going to set up a measuring station. Although it is rumored that several firms in the Lao Zha Bridge have joined the market, it is not certain which firms have joined. Therefore, tomorrow's opening is probably just a formality. Moreover, the current local goods firms directly trade with customers. If they join the market, it will inevitably cause more trouble. Therefore, most firms are taking a wait-and-see attitude. According to reports, most of the local goods and vegetable industry in this city is concentrated in the Shiliupu and Lao Zha Bridge. The local goods firms in Shiliupu mainly deal in fruits and salted cured meats, with vegetables as a sideline. The local goods firms in Lao Zha Bridge mainly deal in vegetables, with fruits and salted cured meats as a sideline.</p>

<p>Expanding the "Anti-Tuberculosis Movement" in Shanghai! Kies</p>
<p>Due to the dense population and poor living conditions, the number of tuberculosis patients on the "isolated island" is increasing day by day. According to general statistics, about 20,000 tuberculosis patients in Shanghai die each year, and 200,000 are still struggling to survive. This is indeed a terrifying and alarming number!</p>
<p>Recently, to meet this need, the "Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association" was organized, which is truly good news for the general public. However, I hope this movement can become even more widespread.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis is more likely to proliferate among the lower classes because their living conditions are worse and the population is denser. They lack good housing and good food; they don't even have fresh air to breathe; and with more than ten hours of work a day, tuberculosis easily attacks them. The disease also spreads rapidly among them because it is common for a dozen people to live in one room. Therefore, to thoroughly prevent tuberculosis, considerable work is needed within this class.</p>
<p>When promoting the anti-tuberculosis movement among the lower classes, in addition to widespread publicity, telling them about the harms of tuberculosis, and urging them to pay attention to hygiene..., it is also necessary to carry out a general examination, because there may be people here who already have tuberculosis. Then, after the examination, they can be asked to move away and be treated. This can prevent the spread of infection to others and enable them to recover their health as soon as possible. However, it is best not to charge for this examination. Start with a simple examination, and if there is a suspicion of tuberculosis, then perform X-rays and other procedures. At this time, they can be asked to pay a little medical fee as much as possible. Of course, it would be even better if they could fulfill their obligations completely.</p>
<p>This is a very urgent matter, and I hope that all the doctors in the city will mobilize to expand the "Anti-Tuberculosis Movement"!</p>
<p>Why Collect Physical Education Fees First? Xixi</p>
<p>After the war, schools were relocated to the two concessions to hold classes, and for a time, there was a worry about a shortage of school buildings. Therefore, various schools successively cut down on less important courses as much as possible, and held half-day classes, which could alleviate the defect of having many students but few classrooms. Under these circumstances, physical education was naturally among the "exemptions".</p>
<p>Our school has always had half-day classes and no physical education classes. However, starting this semester, in addition to collecting miscellaneous fees, an additional physical education fee of two yuan is charged. At that time, we students generally thought that the lack of exercise was detrimental to our health. When we heard that we were going to rent a sports field, we were all overjoyed. In particular, students who loved sports even hoped for a large ball field to satisfy their desires. Even I thought that this move would not only transform the generally listless, weak, and sickly students into vigorous and strong warriors, but also reduce the footsteps of those who frequently went to movie theaters or dance halls.</p>
<p>However, we had been in class for two weeks and had not seen a sports field. So, we successively inquired with the director of instruction about why we collected physical education fees but had no sports field? Was it outside the school and not yet repaired, or had it been rented but the owner did not allow it to be used as a sports field? The director of instruction replied: "The decision to add a sports field was made only when school was about to start. Because the time was so pressing, it was impossible to find one for the time being, so we collected the fees first. In short, the school authorities are now trying their best to find one." Later, when asked why we didn't wait until we found one before collecting the fees? He said: "Currently, prices are soaring, and school expenses have increased sharply. Once we rent it, we may not be able to prepay the rent, so we have to collect the fees first."</p>
<p>As a middle school affiliated with a university with more than a thousand students, even the fee for renting a sports field is not available. Who can believe it?</p>
<p>Now, it has been almost a month since classes started, and the sports field has still not been rented, and the physical education fee has not been refunded. I don't know if the school authorities are using this as a clever plan to increase tuition fees? Or are they using the excuse of soaring prices to make up for the sharp increase in school expenses? It is really incomprehensible, and I hope that the person in charge of the school will read this article and give an honest answer.</p>
<p>After the Rain, the Sky Clears Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 22 News Flies from Afar Respect Discussion and Human Beliefs</p>
<p>The story tells of Shao Huihua and Qu Wushuang leading a group of sisters to visit the newspaper office. From the machine room to the typecasting room, they inevitably talked about the large number of Chinese characters, which also caused trouble in typecasting. Predicting that abolishing Chinese characters will not be accomplished overnight, it is hoped that everyone will promote Esperanto and gradually promote it. Only when children in the future do not read Chinese characters and only know Esperanto can there be a solution. As they talked and talked, they walked from the typecasting room to the type mold room next door. They saw various copper molds arranged clearly. There were large and small imitation Song, large and small square fonts, large and small regular scripts, as well as long, flat, thin, and thick ones. There were no less than thirty kinds of various type molds. In addition, there were also various Western type molds. In total, there were more than one hundred thousand large and small type molds. Some were used the most frequently, and some were kept in reserve. According to Qu Wushuang, more than 500,000 types are cast every day. Because their newspaper uses more than 400,000 characters every day, casting more than 500,000 characters just covers the needs of one day. Casting an extra 100,000 characters is like a reserve army in addition to the standing army. Wu Junsu said: "Oh my! If 500,000 types are cast every day, there will be five million in ten days, and fifty million in a hundred days. Where are there so many frames to put them?" Qu Wushuang laughed and said, "Sister Junsu! What you have seen are the typecasting rooms of those small printing houses. They don't need to cast so many types every day. They put the types from the disassembled plates back on the frames one by one. But here, it's different. The types don't need to be put back on the frames. The plates are disassembled and returned to the furnace on the same day. This has two meanings: First, not having to return the types to the frames saves time and effort. In the past, the work of returning types in the typecasting room was always done by apprentices. But apprentices now have other jobs, and time is money, so save it where you can. Second, after being recast, new types are used every day, so there will never be any blurry or unclear types. So, Sister Junsu is worried that there are too many types and that the frames won't be able to hold them, which is like worrying about the sky falling." From the typecasting room to the stereotype casting area, the stereotype casting area and the paper plate area are two large rooms side by side. Because they are interconnected, it is necessary to make them convenient. Originally, after each plate of types was typeset, it was sent to the paper plate area. The paper plate area has several paper plate machines that use high-pressure hydraulic engines. The typeset plate is placed on the frame, and the original paper plate is also inserted into the machine. The engine is turned on, and hydraulic power is used to press down. In less than two minutes, the paper plate is taken out, and it does not need to be baked. It comes out dry. Why is this? Because the time between typesetting the plate, making the paper plate, and casting the lead plate is the most critical time in the newspaper office. The faster the better, and save every minute you can. (253)</p>

<p>Southern Seas Film Merchants Discuss the "Fashion Film" and "Costume Film" Hai Xing</p>
<p>Rather Than a Harmless Costume Film, Why Not a Conscious Current Affairs Film</p>
<p>After this journal published an "Suggestion Regarding National Films" on the 19th, it has aroused the attention of the general public, which shows that this issue is indeed of considerable importance.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Wu, a Southern Seas film merchant who arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, expressed his opinions on this and talked about the recent situation of national films in the Southern Seas. It is specially recorded here for the reference of national film producers. Mr. Wu said: "In the past, the best-selling national films in the Southern Seas were martial arts films. The martial arts in martial arts films were naturally far inferior to those in American Westerns. However, overseas Chinese always feel particularly close to national films, so they flocked to them. Later, Cantonese films were also popular for a while, because the overseas Chinese were mostly Cantonese and Fujianese, and it was easier to understand the dialects. After August 13th, Mandarin costume films gradually rose to prominence, and now they have a leading position. The reasons for this are: (1) In recent years, overseas Chinese schools have Mandarin instruction, and the Central Radio Station has Mandarin broadcasts every day, so overseas Chinese no longer feel unfamiliar with Mandarin. (2) Mandarin films cost more to produce. Whether in terms of sets, costumes, props, or technology, they are far superior to Cantonese films, so they can be welcomed. However, what overseas Chinese require are costume films with historical figures as the protagonists. In other words, they are implicit works that speak the words of modern people through the mouths of ancient people. It is not easy to attract audiences by relying solely on the form of costumes. Therefore, in the future, I hope that national film producers can pay attention to the content of costume films at the same time. Otherwise, the time when overseas Chinese dislike costume films may not be far away." The reporter asked if fashion films are not popular? He replied: "That's not necessarily true. In my opinion, if there is a conscious fashion film that targets current affairs, it can not only sell well, but may even surpass some harmless costume films. However, film merchants are afraid to take risks and try to suppress the price of copies of fashion films as much as possible. Film companies also make films, so naturally they are unwilling to make fashion films. In my opinion, you can't just pay attention to the form when making costume films. At the same time, I hope that a company can take the risk and try a fashion film. That would be a new path."</p>
<p>(New Force in the Performing Arts World Shanghai to Have a Circus Performance Location Near Dahua Road 遊 Reporter</p>
<p>Since the Haikingberg Circus once performed in Shanghai, this new stimulation of technology with a rough line posture, especially the many livestock and beasts, has aroused the love of urban men and women. However, there are few circus troupes, and the expenses are quite large. Therefore, for many years, Shanghai has not had a circus troupe following Haikingberg.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Shao Zuiweng of Tianyi Film Company and Huang Huaisheng of Jinan Film Company once invited a Global Circus from abroad to perform in Shanghai. However, it was suspended due to improper conditions. Perhaps Shanghai is still a "paradise for adventurers", so Huang Huaisheng, with the support and cooperation of Southern Seas tycoon Dong Songgen, has made this plan more concrete. However, Shao Zuiweng has already withdrawn, and there are several other people such as Qi Wenhua cooperating.</p>
<p>The "Global Circus" will arrive in Shanghai in mid-April. The lineup and technology are quite impressive. Now Chen and Huang are already negotiating the performance venue. It is said that the location is near Gordon Road and Dahua Road. They will build their own zoo and venue. If the address is negotiated, there will be a new and exciting event with a rough line in Shanghai's performing arts scene. There are so many kinds of things in Shanghai, and the ladies are in for a treat. But the back and inner layers of paradise naturally have a scene of hell.</p>
<p>Charity Dance Performance</p>
<p>The news that the Sangmeishi Dance School will hold the 1940 Charity Dance Performance at the Lyceum Theatre has been recorded in the previous war. It is now known that the program of the conference is very exciting. Among them, Ms. Meixun's song and dance are so exquisite and touching. The Viennese Waltz is performed by beautiful Italian girls. The costumes are extremely gorgeous and dazzling. In addition, Qiu Ensang Meishi's Hawaiian dance is exquisite and wonderful, making the audience feel as if they are in an island country. In addition, the famous orchestra accompanies classical music, jazz music, etc., which makes the listeners yearn for it and adds to the color of the conference. The conference will be held for three days from tomorrow, the 23rd, and the 25th and 26th. All ticket proceeds will be allocated to the Tianyou Association to sponsor the living expenses of Chinese female factory workers, which is truly commendable.</p>
<p>A Huarong Road in a Disaster Relief Conference Yu Factory</p>
<p>On the sixth day of the Jingbai Performing Arts Disaster Relief Conference, I drove to the New World at about 2:00 pm because my colleague Xu Jun Chengxu also joined in singing Huarong Road. However, I secretly thought that I had worked with Xu Jun for more than ten years and had never seen him sing Jingban opera on the red carpet. Moreover, Huarong Road is a heavy drama for Hongsheng. At first, I decided to play tickets, but I was worried that something would go wrong. I was quite worried about Xu Jun. Unexpectedly, when Xu Jun came on stage at that time, his performance was beyond expectations. Let me make a brief comment as follows: When he came on stage in the first scene, his majestic and solemn appearance won applause from the audience. Xu Jun's appearance fits our ideal Guan Gong in every way, and this drama is most suitable. My friend Wang Jun Jianzhang said to me while sitting in the audience, this gentleman is a natural talent for singing Guan Gong opera, I don't know where the Tongle Society found him? It can be seen that the talent for singing this opera is rare. The original tune and the important tune were plucked extremely slowly, deeply understanding the secrets of singing. The movements of Guan Ping and Zhou Cang together are very neat and beautiful. During the time of sitting in the tent and giving orders, the expression on his face and the movements on his body have reached a state of perfection. Singing the Allegro with Cao Cao is also very fluent. The only regret is that the bottom breath is slightly insufficient, so the singing is not very loud. If he can work hard to adjust his voice and gradually lengthen the adjustments, he will be able to avoid this regret. My friend is a connoisseur, or he may not think this statement is absurd.</p>

<p>Unofficial History of the Pear Garden Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Qin and Drum Master of the South (Below)</p>
<p>After Yu Tian obtained Zhao's name, he visited his residence three times. Song Shougu was also familiar with the name of Da Suo (Yu Tian Xiao Yu) for a long time. Of course, he hit it off at first sight. Whenever Mei had any questions, he would teach him wholeheartedly. From then on, the two became close friends. Later, when Lao Tan came south, he did not bring Xiaosheng when he performed "Eight Hammers" and "Zhensou Zhou", and he even strongly asked Xiao Lian to be paired with Lu Wenlong and Yang Zaixing in the drama. This was Mei's encouragement, hoping to increase the reputation of Song Shou's father and son. In fact, Xiao Kang is a martial arts actor, not good at martial arts Xiaosheng dramas. Tan's unconventional use is also a rare anecdote. Also, Chen Ajin, a Qin master in Shanghai, whose stage name was Zhen Yishi, and Song Shou's drum were known as the best. At the Guifen Conference, when he came to Shanghai in a certain year, his Qin master was unable to play the Qin due to illness? The class leader then recommended Ajin as a substitute. Wang Datou thought that his art was invincible, and that his singing style could not be properly set off by others, so he first had a contemptuous attitude towards Ajin. When he came on stage, he sang a certain slow board, and the Qin string suddenly broke. At this time, not only Datou was in a hurry, looking at Ajin frequently, revealing a small happy meaning, but also all the people on the stage and the backstage stewards were sweating for Ajin. It is known that Ajin was unusually calm, acting as if nothing had happened, and he actually used the lower handle to play a single string (that is, one string) to end this section. After the drama, Ajin apologized to Datou, who greeted him with a smile and said: "Today, I know how high your Qin art is. It is truly worthy of the name." According to the famous Qin masters in the past, they only carried a Qin with them when they went on stage, and there was no other Qin placed next to them. Moreover, the matter of breaking strings is not often heard of. Some say that since Ajin is called a famous master in Jiangnan, how can there be such a coincidence? Could he have deliberately broken a string to show off his ability? The era is long ago, and almost no one can prove its authenticity.</p>
<h3>American Newspaper Refutes Wang Jingwei</h3>
<p>New York—Following accusations by Wang Jingwei's spokesperson that American newspapers in Shanghai were only publishing authorized opinions aimed at damaging Wang's reputation, The New York Times responded yesterday in an editorial. It stated that the one authorizing these opinions was Wang himself, not President Roosevelt or Secretary of State Hull. The editorial noted that Wang was initially an ardent patriot but his will gradually weakened until he forgot the suffering of his own people under Japanese aggression and willingly helped the Japanese organize a Chinese puppet government, hoping to legitimize Japanese aggression through peaceful means. It concluded by saying that Wang's unholy idea of sacrificing his countrymen with what he represents as a "gentleman" deserving no respect, is what has provoked the criticism of American newspapers.

<h3>Roosevelt's Health</h3>
<p>Washington—According to White House sources, President Roosevelt is suffering from influenza with a slightly elevated temperature. All appointments for yesterday were canceled, and doctors have advised the President to rest sufficiently. (Haitong, 20th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Likely to Serve a Third Term as President, Supported Strongly by the Democratic Party</h3>
<p>Washington—Well-informed sources in Washington now believe that President Roosevelt will continue to be the master of the White House until at least 1944. Even Republicans publicly acknowledge that the next presidential seat will still belong to Roosevelt. However, Roosevelt himself has not yet expressed his opinion on whether he wishes to serve a third consecutive term as president. But it is generally felt that if there is a suitable opportunity, Roosevelt would still be willing to run. He believes he understands international affairs more thoroughly than anyone else in the government and is deeply aware that the United States cannot escape the influence of the European war. He eagerly desires to be at the helm during these turbulent times, guiding the United States to safety and ensuring that America contributes to the post-war peace negotiations. Currently, he is closely monitoring the developments in Europe and does not wish to comment on a third term unless absolutely necessary. If the European war makes significant progress and the international situation becomes increasingly dangerous, Roosevelt will decide his own course. At the beginning of this month, the Democratic National Committee met in Washington to discuss the location of the national convention. Many committee members expressed that if Roosevelt is willing, the majority would support his decision to run for a third consecutive term. Even those within the Democratic Party who oppose a third term are refraining from objecting to Roosevelt's re-election because they know that the issues in the Far East and Europe are closely related to the United States and do not want to change political leadership during these critical times. Some say that if peace in Europe is realized soon, the Republican Party may have a chance to compete for the presidential seat this November. However, if a major war breaks out, the American people will be reluctant to change leaders. The outcome of the presidential election will be determined not by domestic politics or disputes over new policies, but by foreign affairs and foreign policy. Illinois will hold a presidential primary on April 9th. Without consulting Roosevelt, his name has already been included on the primary ballot as a test of his popularity with the people, and it can be inferred at that time whether Roosevelt is supported by the people. It is expected that Roosevelt may make an announcement after the results of this test are released. A portion of the Democratic Party has already launched a movement to support Roosevelt's third term, and they are publishing the writings of the Founding Father George Washington to show that Washington never opposed a president with good policies serving three consecutive terms. Generally speaking, Roosevelt has ample power within the Democratic Party, and there is no doubt that Roosevelt can be nominated for the presidency by the Democratic Party for a third time. If Roosevelt is tired of the job, then current Secretary of State Hull will be recommended as his successor. As for the Republican contenders, there are three: Vandenberg, Taft, and Wilkie. It is predicted that the Republican Party will nominate Taft and Wilkie as candidates for president and vice president. However, according to general public opinion, they are no match for Roosevelt, and if Roosevelt agrees to run again, the presidential seat will still belong to Roosevelt. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<h3>Final Meeting of the All-India Congress; Gandhi's Farewell Message; Demanding Followers Break the Chains of Slavery; Anti-Compromise Faction Continues Struggle</h3>
<p>India, Ramgarh—Gandhi, the spiritual leader of India's national independence movement, delivered a farewell message at the All-India Congress yesterday, asking his followers to break the chains of slavery. He stated that if they want him as their commander, they must accept his conditions. Since he led the army (metaphorically), he has never failed. Furthermore, since he was born, he has never had a single failure, and he does not know what failure means. Finally, he does not want them to fail either. His failure will become their failure, and at the same time, it will become India's failure. We must fight before we can achieve victory. It is noted that only 10,000 people participated in the Congress today. 200,000 people could have attended on Tuesday, but they were driven away by torrential rain. At the last gathering of the Congress, the participants were wading in water because the water on the square was ankle-deep. Gandhi attended the Congress wearing only a piece of white cloth around his waist and a white scarf. After giving his farewell message to the All-India Congress, he left for Wardha last night. (United Press, 21st)</p>
<p>Ramgarh—Yesterday, Gandhi, the leader of the All-India National Congress, firmly stated that he would not launch a civil disobedience movement until the conditions of his non-violence were implemented, and he criticized the All-India Congress Committee for lacking discipline. He said, "Your leaders feel that you are not yet ready. If we act according to your suggestions, we will inevitably fail." At the same time, the anti-compromise faction held another conference, passing a resolution asking its chairman to form an All-India Action Committee to begin the struggle, and setting April 6 as the date to begin the All-India struggle. The resolution also advocated that this action should express India's unwillingness to participate in the European war and reflect the determination of the administrators to return.

<h3>Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union Reported to Issue Joint Declaration Explaining "New Europe" Unification Plan; Molotov Rumored to Visit Berlin</h3>
<p>Amsterdam—Rumors in Berlin that a "major political event" would occur before Easter have gained new momentum due to the departure of the Soviet ambassador to Germany. It is widely believed that the ambassador's trip to Moscow is to arrange a meeting between the leaders of the German and Soviet governments. Some neutral observers believe that German Aviation Minister Goering and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop may visit Moscow, while others believe that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov may be invited to Berlin. According to Berlin dispatches from newspapers here, diplomatic circles in Berlin expect that Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union will soon issue a declaration explaining the unification plan for the "New Europe" under the leadership of these three countries. German diplomats are currently trying to reduce Berlin's concerns about the French cabinet crisis and are telling neutral journalists that the French cabinet crisis does not change Hitler's determination to fight to the end. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Stockholm—A Moscow dispatch from a local newspaper states that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will visit Berlin around Easter. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Berlin—Dr. Schnurre, a key figure in German politics, published an article in the "Five-Year Plan" magazine discussing the German-Soviet trade agreement signed on February 11 this year. The main points are: First, pointing out the small volume of German-Soviet trade in 1938 and that the credit agreement signed on August 19, 1939, was not sufficient to cope with the German-Polish War and the situation after the outbreak of the German-British-French War and the demands of German-Soviet trade. Therefore, on September 28 last year, Germany decided to conduct negotiations with the Soviet Union for a more advanced economic agreement. This negotiation ended on February 11 this year. Schnurre then pointed out the advantages of the new trade agreement. It is said that the new agreement guarantees the most needed raw materials during wartime, guarantees the supply of important foods such as grains, peas, and soybeans for the German people, and stipulates clauses for the rapid transportation of raw materials. The negotiations in recent months have focused on the issue of transportation. The German-Soviet transportation agreement established in 1939 gave new impetus to railway transportation between the two countries. In the past, transportation between Germany and the Soviet Union was through Baltic ports, but now the two countries have railways passing through the new borders of Germany and the Soviet Union. Railway transportation is simple and convenient, which was previously unseen. Schnurre reiterated that the Soviet Union has a great appetite for German industrial products, and the Soviet Union's vast resources and the prospects for industrial development are just beginning. It will be very smooth for Germany to promote the sale of machinery and tools needed to expand industries to the Soviet Union. (Haitong, 21st)</p>

<h3>Italian Prime Minister Encourages Residents of Northern Border Region</h3>
<p>Rome—Prime Minister Mussolini recently gave a speech to the residents of Upper Adige in the north, stating that the Brenner Pass would no longer be a factor causing disputes between Germany and Italy, but would become a bridge for the mutual flow of the great cultural revolutions of the two major nations. From now on, the residents of this province can truly consider themselves Italians and will not be moved out of the country or transplanted to other parts of the Italian Empire. (Havas, 21st)</p>

<p>Paris—After former Daladier cabinet's Finance Minister Reynaud received the mandate to attempt to form a new cabinet, Daladier stated at a meeting of Radical Socialist Party members of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies last night that he had refused the task of forming a cabinet. The meeting lasted for an hour and a half, and a vote of confidence in Daladier was passed. It was heard that Daladier requested the publication of the full report of the Chamber of Deputies' secret meeting. Since Daladier declared that he would decline to form a cabinet, the French President summoned Reynaud to the presidential residence last night and asked him to form a cabinet. Reynaud said, "I hope to give the President a definite answer tomorrow morning." It is heard that Reynaud will try his best to form a national unity cabinet, recruiting key figures from both the left and right, such as Blum, the first Socialist Prime Minister of France. According to those close to Daladier, Daladier is not prepared to join the Reynaud cabinet, even if he is offered the post of Minister of the Army. A national unity government will significantly change the current cabinet. As for how to meet the requirements of organizing a smaller and more powerful cabinet, it is currently—anticipated. Political figures still believe that Daladier may form a cabinet based on radical elements. According to what the general public here is saying, this cabinet crisis is not a sign of France's weakening desire for victory, but a general demand for a stronger prosecution of the war. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Paris—After President Lebrun commissioned Finance Minister Reynaud to try to form a new cabinet, Finance Minister Reynaud immediately met with Colonial Minister Mandel and other key figures to consult, and visited Prime Minister Daladier at the Ministry of the Army. Afterwards, he also met with Senate President Jeanneney and Chamber of Deputies President Herriot as usual to discuss cabinet formation matters, which had not been completed until midnight. According to well-informed sources, the new cabinet may be formed today and attend the Chamber of Deputies on the 22nd. In addition, the Radical Socialist Party parliamentary group held a meeting today, chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Chautemps, and immediately passed a resolution unanimously expressing confidence and sincerity in Party Leader Prime Minister Daladier. Prime Minister Daladier then explained that he wanted to abide by the tradition of parliamentary politics and therefore refused to accept the mandate to form a new cabinet again. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Paris—After the resignation of the Daladier cabinet, people in the Chamber of Deputies' lounge said that Daladier's refusal to continue forming a new cabinet showed that he could not obtain the necessary majority in the Chamber of Deputies. As for the so-called President Lebrun's commissioning of Finance Minister Reynaud to try to form a new cabinet, it has created a good impression because Reynaud's speeches in the Chamber of Deputies over the years have been well received, and the decisions he has taken during his tenure as Minister of Finance are sufficient to show his strong personality. He once expressed his willingness to expand the Ministry of Finance into a Ministry of National Economy, and to give it the power to supervise national production and consumption agencies, and to study this issue not only from the national point of view, but also to discuss with British Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir Simon and US Undersecretary of State Welles on how to improve the world's production organization and resource allocation methods. His ambition is evident from this. In the Senate, it is also recognized that Reynaud is brave and resourceful, and is also full of imagination. Therefore, they also expressed their approval of the President's mandate for him to rent a cabinet. However, according to sources, Daladier has indicated to Reynaud that he urgently needs rest, and he may not be able to continue to serve as Minister of National Defense and Minister of the Army in the new cabinet. Apart from this, Reynaud may encounter other difficulties in politics. If Reynaud's cabinet formation fails, then Daladier may come out again, which is also possible. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Preparing to Reshuffle</h3>
<p>London—The Daily Mail recently reported that Parliament is scheduled to adjourn for several days starting this afternoon, and Prime Minister Chamberlain may take this opportunity to reshuffle the cabinet and change the organization of the cabinet's war council. This council includes the ministers of the various defense departments and currently has nine cabinet members participating in it. In the future, the number of people should be reduced to concentrate on preparing war plans. The new French cabinet will definitely adopt the same attitude, so that Britain and France can work together more closely. It is reported that Prime Minister Chamberlain—invited the leader of the opposition Liberal Party, Sir Sinclair, the leader of the Labour Party, Attlee, and several members of various parties to join the cabinet, but the parties may not accept.

<h3>French Military Court Opens Trial of Communists; Several Famous Lawyers Defend the Accused</h3>
<p>Paris—Forty-four former Communist members of the Chamber of Deputies engaged in propaganda work for the First International and were instructed by the Soviet government to send a letter to the Speaker of the Chamber, Berlioz, advocating peace. Thirty-five of them, including Thorez and Renaud, have been arrested by the authorities. There are also nine people who are at large, including former Communist Party Secretary-General Duclos, former Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, etc. The military court here began the trial this morning. The government representative, based on the interests of national defense and public order, requested that the public be prohibited from attending the hearing, but the defense committee organized by the Socialist Party objected, saying that the country has never used this procedure for handling political cases. After consideration by the judges of the military court, it was announced at 8:00 PM tonight that the decision was made to change to a closed-door trial and continue the hearing tomorrow morning. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Paris—When thirty-five former French Communist members of Parliament were tried in this local superior court today, several well-known lawyers defended them. According to the well-known lawyer Chaulard, the defendant was convicted for advocating union with the Soviet Union. Then Daladier and Bonnet should be even more guilty, because Daladier and Bonnet had previously advocated union with the Soviet Union—. Other well-known lawyers such as Schivas-Boutel defended the Communist Party, but when the court opened, security was tight, and soldiers with bayonets maintained order. The audience in the gallery reached five hundred people. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
