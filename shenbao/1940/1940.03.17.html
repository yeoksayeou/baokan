<h3>美日經濟係與國交</h3>
<p>日本自對中國發動侵略戰之後，他的一切工業，均依戰時需求多所更張；竭其全力，從事於軍需品的製造。但是日本國內重工業的基礎，根本脆弱而幼稚，所需軍需品原料，大部仰給於國外；由於生產的偏廢，外滙的消耗，公私經濟乃具見重大的動搖。當此時會，經不起再斷絕外援，或喪失對外通商的利益。但是，美國宣佈廢止美日商約自實際失效以後，龐大的對美通商利益，以及生活與侵略的貨源，絕無保障而陷於風雨飄搖的地位了。</p>
<p>美國雖在太平洋的東岸，遠離日本；但是日美兩國之間，歷來保持着最便捷最直綫的海運貿易，故兩國的商業關係，異常密切。加之美國天賦富饒，工業發達，金銀銅鐵鎂煤石油等的出產，均冠全球；棉花，麥，玉蜀黍等農產品，亦極豐富。其國際地位原來有凌駕一切之觀；及歐戰爆發，其處境之優越，更爲全球各國所莫與倫比，遠溯半世紀以來，日本依賴美國的貿易，向稱最鉅，即以近年而論，如一九三四年至一九三八年之間，日本對美輸出總額的廿六萬萬日圓，輸入總額約四十五萬萬日圓，故輸入超過額達十九萬萬日圓，亦即輸入對輸出爲九與五之此；在此期間，美國對於日本的出超美國出超的占總額百分之廿七。此項統計，固然可以表示日本是美國的好顧客；但就重要貿易品的種類上觀之，日本對美輸出除生絲外，其他各種商品如罐頭食品，陶器磁器等，均非美國所必需；反之，日本所仰給於美國的輸入情形，則大爲不同。考之近年統計，日本一九三六年的輸入總額爲廿七萬餘萬（二，七六四·〇〇〇，〇〇〇）日圓，其中直接軍需品占六萬六千萬日圓，一九三八年的輸入總額爲廿六萬餘萬（二，六六三，〇〇〇，〇〇〇）日圓，其中直接軍需品占十二萬餘萬（一，二四七，〇〇〇，〇〇〇）日圓。更據日本著名經濟學家小島精一氏的硏究結果，亦確認日本在國防工業的海外補給上觀之，美陶實占特別重要的地位。就　運方面言之，日本向稱發達，年來更大事擴展；西對歐洲，東往美洲，南駛南洋羣島，均有其航綫。自一九二一年以來，日本船隻通過蘇彝士運河的噸數，每年約在九十萬噸與一百萬噸之間，年來仍無多大變化；而其通過巴拿馬運河的船隻總數，則已由一九一九年的卅四萬噸，遞次增加，待至一九三七年，已達到一百七十萬噸之距。兩相比較，後者突飛猛進，確已後來居上；雖日通過巴拿馬運河的船隻，未必一定赴美。而經濟活動的範圍，亦非船舶噸數所可測量；但由此亦可見日本海運之依存於美國者，如何嚴重。原來任何兩國間的通商，必雙方皆受其利；惟分析其所獲之利益，則性質輒殊，關係逈異，其間影響與最後結果，便有霄壤之別；換言之，貿易方式雖彼此相對，但兩國相互依存的程度，完全不相同。以日美通商情形言之，日本經濟機構依賴美國的程度，遠較美國經濟機構所依賴日本者爲深切，美國倘若喪失日本的市塲，失去日貨的供給，絕不足以動搖美國的經濟生命，反之，日本倘若失去了美國市塲與美貨供給；則日本經濟上必受致命的打擊。簡單的說：日本不可失去美國，美國不妨放棄日本。故日本對美的經濟關係，在日本方面是絕對需要積極調整的。</p>
<p>美日關係的亟待調整，爲日方所深知；但是美日關係的惡化，竟然爲日本方面最初所不甚理會，繼而尙想用謊話與咆哮來挽回惡化的趨勢。日本方面似不覺得惡化的原因在「九一八」開始的暴行，日本且以爲美國宣告廢除美日通商航海條的，是突然的意外的，是美國情虧理曲的。日本到現在似乎尙未覺悟，美日關係惡化的根本原因，在於日本暴力侵略中國，企圖獨霸遠東。要知美日關係惡化的根本原因旣在於此，則日本如要改善對美關係，恢復其經濟機能，必須修正其對華侵略政策，必須停止其對華暴力行動。</p>
<p>觀察日本最近的對美態度，似乎略有省覺，但尙未澈底覺悟。它知道對美關係不可更惡化了，知道對美關係最好獲得調整；但是它還想用政治的外交的小魔術來移轉美國堅定的遠東政策，還想用虛聲恫嚇來喝退美國計畫的制暴步調，還想在中國造就煙幕來使美國徬徨迷惑，還想在中國加速榨取，增進國勢，以排除美國，制伏美國。日本不但如此想，並且已經分頭的如此蠻幹。日本非無智者，但是利令智昏；非切實加以有效的當頭棒喝，無望其澈底覺悟。它何嘗不了解美國的經濟壓力，可致日本於死命；它却以爲美國已經接受了日本的恐嚇，故不敢運用經濟壓</p>

<h3>齋藤除名事件　國內反響重大　日陸軍方面舉行會議　謀所謂軍民融洽辦法</h3>

<h3>朱家驊論歐戰　對華並無不利（續）　中國外交運用游刃有餘　且負世界和平重要使命</h3>
<p>蘇德間的交通運輸情形、亦是値得我們注意的、波羅的海的海運、很容易受英法海軍的威脅、且在冬季尙因冰凍而不能完全使用、黑海及多瑙河的航程、須經過其他國家、亦難保不有被截斷的危險、最可靠而最便利的、是橫過波蘭的鐵路、可是在這裏我們須得考量蘇聯的運輸效率、他的鐵路雖已由七萬三千公里增至八萬五千公里、車輛由四十七萬五千增至六十四萬五千輛、載重量由八百七十萬噸增至一千五百七十萬噸、但據專家們的估計、蘇聯現時至多只能騰出十分之一的運輸量、作爲對德輸出之用、我們假定每輛車皮每月使用一次、這樣騰出來的運輸工具、還不够用來載運德國平時所需用的鐵砂</p>
<p>有了上述諸因、有形的或無形的限制了德蘇間的經濟往來、縱使兩國更進一步的密切合作、然欲單獨以蘇聯的經濟援助支持德國作戰到底、誠戞戞乎其難了、</p>
<h3>五論『以牙還牙』</h3>
<p>希特勒很明白、他知道德國經濟弱點、就是戰爭上的最大弱點、所以他採取了「以牙還牙」來決定他的戰略、他知道英國戰時所需的物資在海外、（如佔英國輸入額百分之四十七的食糧、須來自加拿大澳洲新西蘭等地）、英法海軍旣緊密地將德國封鎖了、德國便亦用他的潛艇和磁力水雷、對英法施行反封鎖、爲欲澈底收效起見、並定下了海上游擊戰的戰略、連袖珍戰艦亦放了出來、到處活動、據四個月來的統計、英國船隻已經損失了一百萬噸以上、這個數字當然已經够大了、可是火國商用的船隻共有二千一百萬噸、且隨時在製造補充中、德國要想憑藉海上游擊戰以擊破英國的海上勢力、殊不可能、我們知道、在陸地戰上、如果游擊隊不配合正規軍作戰、便無由決定戰爭的勝負、在海戰自不能例外的、空戰亦然、如果空軍不配合陸軍或海軍作戰、那麽、就是希特勒的戈林所最自負的空軍、也難獨立作戰或決戰、而且在空軍人員的訓練和補充方面、德國亦較英法爲遜色、一般統計說來、一個健全民族每一千人裏面、只能挑選出一個空軍人才、假定每架飛機需要四人計算、則在現時歐洲列强中、就沒有一國可以培養二萬架以上的飛機、因爲飛機僅可競製、而架駛及能作戰的人員畢竟有限、英法連同屬地人口共有六萬萬二千五百三十萬、至少在空軍人員補充上較德國便利、所以現時德國的空軍與英法的空軍相較而略佔優勢、而在不久的將來、英法仗着人力物力財力擴充空軍的結果、會有駕德國而上的趨勢、到那時德國因顧慮人員補充的困難、也許不便把他的空軍送到英法的領空上孤注一擲了、至於德國的工業區域、百分之六十離前綫只一百五十哩、易遭敵國空軍的襲擊、而英國的工業區、在離前綫三百哩以外、實遠較爲安全、這猶其餘事、</p>
<p>海上游擊戰固然是一種良好的戰略空軍的儘量襲擊亦可收莫大的效果、但大會戰或決戰、只能靠陸地戰、迄今爲止、交戰國雙方竭力避免正面接觸、全力集注於消耗戰、勢非把敵人的戰鬥力消耗至相當程度、不求一決雌雄、然則歐戰何時纔會展開呢、即是交戰國何時開始向馬奇諾陣綫或西格佛利陣綫進攻呢、</p>
<p>要突破這兩道陣綫、雖非全不可能、但犧牲之大、必難想像、這也是交戰國雙方都不肯輕易嘗試的緣故、從上次大戰得來的維騐、陣地戰是最令人煩悶不過的、這回的陣地戰如果發生、廣時費事、必十百倍於從前、而戰爭之延長乃意中事、戰爭愈延長下去、對德國自然愈爲不利、</p>
<p>邇來在軍事方面傳說紛紜、不是說德國將假道荷蘭比利時進攻、便是說他企圖拖義大利下水、俾在波河平原來一個大會戰、可信與吾、誠屬疑問、姑假定一樣，也不是短期內可以實現的、在德國方面、因爲處於各種客觀條件支配之下、利於早日結束戰爭、因而對主力戰的要求較諸英法爲迫切、乃逐漸採用一種帶有殲滅性的消耗戰略、這是和英法的戰略微有不同的地方、我國不應該把他忽略過去的、（未完）</p>

<h3>工部局加捐　已遭遇反響　旅業執照捐竟增加三倍　納稅人對白俄隊表不滿</h3>
<p>此次工部局爲平衡收支、增加捐稅、自消息公諸報端後、市民惶恐、不安旦夕、茲上海市旅館業同業公會、因該局所增該業營業執照捐至一倍半以上、特於昨日致函公共租界華人納稅會暨工部局華董虞洽卿氏、籲請正義援助、茲探錄其原函如下、</p>
<p>增加稅率駭人聽聞　逕啟者、案據敝會各同業先後來會聲稱、頃奉工部局通知、自本年四月一日起、所有營業執照捐、依照原額增加、有自百分之一百五十至二百者、會員等驟增如此之鉅大稅率、不僅不勝負担、實有被迫停業之虞、爲此迫不得已、仰懇貴會迅予援助、以維營業等語、到會、准此、當敝同業自一二八至八一三之五六年間、營業一落千丈、門可羅雀、皆有早不保暮之勢、故當時停閉而易主者不知凡幾、近一二年間、雖見轉機、然喘息未定、猶不足補償昔年之損失、矧邇來因物價之狂漲、更難得利、今日用品菲不高漲不已、姑不具論、即以燃煤一項論、每噸須二百五十餘元、每家每天之用煤量、（以五十個房間之中下等旅館不燒水汀之時期計）、至少須二籮至半噸、（使用水汀時期則須一噸至二噸）、則每天共售之房價、猶恐不足燃煤一項之用、敝同業雖曾酌加售價、然杯水車薪、無補毫末、况水電伙食薪工房租、以及一切一切、無不大漲特漲、試問在此情况之下、有何利益可圖、在工部局平衡收支起見、酌加稅捐、亦屬事理之常、但稅率之增加、由百分之一百五十至二百之鉅、實開加稅之創聞、</p>
<p>喘息未定何堪担　至於工部局同之支出合理與否、姑置不論、豈平衡收支之責任、均須旅館業負担之耶、嘗聞抽稅者、必先培養稅源、我旅館業尙在喘息未定之際、亟應培養稅源之時、今驟加如此不克負担之稅率、不但跡近敲吸、實欲置我旅業之死命而已、敝會爲全體同業之生存起見、不得不大聲疾呼、懇求各界正義之援助、並請貴會轉函工部局、愼重考慮、迅即收回成命、酌予核减、以維敝同業生計、實深禱切、此致公共租界華人納稅會、至於致虞洽卿氏函、略謂、查台端領袖羣倫、視民如傷、數十年來、仗義行俠、夙爲全市民所敬仰、更兼當選歷屆之華董、在工部局一言九鼎、定能解除我全體同業之倒縣、爲此不揣冒昧、　懇台、鼎力予援救、以維全體同業之生討云、</p>
<p>白俄隊作何種工作　字林報云、本市納稅人、因上海生活程度日高、與市捐之復將增加、致担重負、羣情憤然、今擬向寓國商團白俄隊發洩其憤怒情緒、而以一若輩究作何種工作、致有保持必要爲問、實則白俄隊工作殊繁重、由下述之該隊</p>
<p>普通職務　可見一斑、白俄隊共官佐十三員、其他各級團丁三百十一人、內至少三十人須久駐萬國商團司令部、充運輸車駕駛人者二十二人、傳令者八人、該隊派出團丁四十一人、守衛外灘浮碼頭、廿八人守衛膠州路新加坡路之孤軍營、又守衛工部局大厦與外灘萬國商團營房者十八人、以上共計每日担任職務者八十七人、此外、商團團部隨時有三十人、準備接獲任何緊急呼召而出動、至此、每日値班或待令出動者、共一百十七人、佔全隊三分之一以上、凡久歷戎行者、皆知每隊三分之一、逐日値班、其工作繁重已極、</p>
<p>團丁落班　後、並非如若干人所料想之飽食無事、蓋除値班二十四小時後、甫吿休憇者外、不値班之國丁、皆須訓練應付暴動與槍械操練等、每日五六小時、白俄隊對於警務處、頗多襄助、如駐守外灘浮碼頭、即係助護警務人員、但不從事檢查、白俄隊恒襄助警務處進行搜查、而在被查屋宇四週佈警戒綫、查白俄隊係一九二七年一月成立、計兩中隊、旋於一九三二年二月增加一中隊、而達目下之實力、實係警務處最初之後備隊、而免萬國商團動員、以應付微細之緊急事件、</p>
<p>美艦動態</p>
<p>據美海軍方面所獲消息、美揚子江巡艦「呂宋」號、將於明晨（十八日）啟椗赴蕪湖、美揚子江巡邏艦隊司令格拉斯福特、本駐於「呂宋」號、茲以「呂宋」號即將離滬、氏或仍將留駐上海、而駐於行將自蕪來滬之「瓜姆」號上、惟關於格氏之行蹤、目前尙無確報、聞「呂宋」號抵蕪後、將駐一月、然後與「瓜姆」號調防、又訊、美巡洋艦奧格斯晚號及大理石號、是否將於下月轉山靑島烟台而來滬、現尙未有所聞、</p>
<h3>長江開放渺茫　日方遁詞塞責　日大使館發言人謂此事尚須再加討論</h3>
<p>揚子江開放問題、據日大使館發言人於招待記者席上稱、「新中央政府」成立後、長江開放問題、是否屬於其法權內所應解決之問題、此事尙須予以討論或可由新成立之「政府」予以取決、但開放政策之原則、須由東京日政府予以決定、開放與否、殊爲渺茫、</p>
<h3>平準物價　將有發展　若干種制度近期內執行</h3>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、頃悉、法租界公董局與公共租界工部局新近成立之平凖物價小組委員會、以調查反常之生活現况、及提議改善辦法者、刻正圓滿進行其工作、雖至少在目下之調查工作、未吿竣事時、未必採取確切步驟、但公董局與工部局之完全合作、今已實行、而若干種制度、不日將有發展、按约十日前、該兩小組委員會間、已舉行初步會議、擬定進行調查之計劃、</p>
<h3>工部局美董競選人　阿樂滿談話　渠唯良政與節用是尚</h3>
<p>本年度工部局議董競選、美僑方面擁護美籍名律師阿樂滿爲議董候選人者、頗爲踴躍、今美僑聯合會將開始預選、俾在阿樂满·卡爾那·與麥唐納三候選人中、選出正式候選人兩人、聞阿樂滿頗有入選之望、頃據阿樂滿對競選事發表意見書稱、友好多人近敦促余出爲工部局議董候選人、余已勉徇諸友之意、而願爲候選人之一、余自一九一六年來華、曾在美外交界與領署供職七載、一九二三年辭職後、即在滬上執行律務、設辦公處於公共租界、並自一九三二年起、寓居越界築路區安和寺路、而向工部局繳納寓所與辦公處之市捐、一九二三年萬國商團美國隊成立、余即入該隊服務、余旣自一九二一年起僑居上海、今望終老是鄉、余所關切者、工部局應徵收與善良治制相稱之可能的最低捐稅、願見工部局對於目下之經費與將來之義務、均視共力之所能及、依量入爲出之基礎而支付之、余在此短書中、不能對各種市政問題發表見解、質言之、余對許多市政問題、尙未得諗其詳、故不能發爲精明之意見、但余苟被推出而當選、則余將以充分之時間、研究市政問題而一一了解之、無論如何、余唯良政與節用是尙、余非任何個人·公司·或黨派之候選人、茍被推出而常選、則不對一私人負有義務、惟將視一己爲代表公共租界之全體市民、而不論其有無選舉權也、</p>

<p>熟水業稱　本市兩租界共有老虎灶六百餘家加入公會爲會員者計五百五十家、每家每月用煤约五噸至七噸、全市熟水業每月需供給煤三千噸左右、戰前煤價每噸僅十餘元、兩年來因煤逐步高漲、近且破二百元大關、在此情形下、一般熟水業均係小本經營、試問如何維持營業、</p>
<p>唯一辦法　祇有要求開灤煤公司直接供給、深望各界予以同情與援助、至如何進行交涉、此時未便發表、</p>

<p>米麥擁到　大陸報云、昨（十五日）據本市商界談稱、邇來從產糧區抵滬船隻、幾皆載有大批食糧、尤以米麥爲多故食物價格日內可望「大跌」、已經一週來、運滬米麥、各不下二十萬袋、且料數日內將有更多米麥運此、挪威船安格納斯號、載米一萬六千袋、昨自西貢抵埠、又挪船弗蘭姆號、載米二萬五千袋、定十六日從西貢駛抵上海、丹麥船諾特凡斯號、從澳洲駛出、載麥逾七千五百噸、十八日可抵滬、自河道運滬之杜米、雖仍稀少、但聞從產米區裝卡車「私運」來兩租界之杜米、日達二十餘車、且有增加之勢、</p>

<h3>平民婦孺醫院　籌募經費　目的為五萬元</h3>
<p>上海平民婦孺醫院為籌募經常費起見、即日開始募捐運動、目的為五萬元、該院免費接生、造福貧苦、殊非淺鮮、茲錄該院簡史、及此次募捐辦法如次、</p>
<p>該院簡史　民國二十六年秋、上海受戰事影響、四郊難民避入租界者、不下二十萬人、備嘗困苦、而產婦臨盆、每不能如期送到醫院、尤以晚間宵禁後更多危險、各慈善機關如國際紅十字會·國際救濟會·上海婦女會·上海聯靑社·工部局衛生處·救世軍·以及中華慈幼協會等十餘團體、一再討論、擬於醫院近旁設置產婦收容所、使各孕婦得適當之營養、而臨產之際、亦可免去奔波之危險、於是共同議決、組織該院、最初院址在勞勃生路一一〇號、自成立以來、中外人士一致贊助、難民孕婦受惠實深、而該院產婦死亡率不過爲百分之一、較任何難民醫院爲佳、最近該院以勞勃生路房屋賃期已滿、遷至威海衛路七三七號、</p>
<p>社會需要　根據一年半之經騐、該院深知上海一埠之貧苦者、對於該院實爲急切之需要、蓋全上海醫院中、並無免費接生之服務、僅有者、祗爲同仁醫院、但床舖不多、後至者每抱向偶、該院目前雖有床位五十張仍不敷用、故亟待擴充、至該院現任院長爲沈驥英醫師、沈在北平協和醫院兒科專任醫師、會任職北平衛生局及兒童福利委員會、沈醫師秉豐富之經騐、服務之熱忱、爲供應上海產婦服務之需要、並力求普及起見、特擬定在上海設立服務網、已成立者　處、一爲女靑會之工業處、一爲惇信路之難民收容所、並於產婦於生產時不能離家住院者、該院亦正硏究服務之方法、</p>

<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、晨開堅俏、但漲勢猶如曇花一現、即吿下墮、蓋以美滙先緊後硬、且投機商多頭押款到期、受貸方滙豐催贖而賣出、致早時之漲、大半失去、晨開因美滙報緊、加之港帮活動、散戶跟風亦買、遂於競購之下、一跳九十七元、爲五千一百卅元高峯、不意外滙因港電之扒英塞美而已止緊、期貨一致驟鬆、今日美英滙兌又有看漲之訊、證劵帮乘高力賣、冉加現金號猛塞繼後、遂退達五千零五十四元、嗣以錢兌業忽來撈進、而證券帮亦轉賣爲買、又升爲五千零八十元、但現余號見機再出、銀樓帮稍吐、且斯時美滙回硬、小至五千零五十元低價、午刻某銀號塌便宜撈入、故迄午收、尙有五千零六十五元、結果軋漲三十二元、午後塲外潛勢尙佳、最後價爲五千零七十元、半天交易仍旺、約三千兩光景、銀樓飾金先高後低、終則平平、海關金等呆定、</p>
<p>烚赤回卅二元</p>
<p>自晨每條、十兩）、初開因美滙報緊、人心復堅、檯面上買聲震耳、尤以錢兌　進意更濃、競相猛抬、且賣者見勢暫作旁觀、故延至九點半開市、遂橫跳九十七元、某錢兌業進金號五十兩、爲五千一百三十元、有證券帮首肯賣出、接踵現金號亦爭先力塞、加之滙市巳報回硬、價頓急轉直下、不久即回落七十六元、證券帮出錢兌業五十兩、爲五千零五十四元、此後錢兌業忽來撈進、同時某體劵帮亦轉賣爲買、遂又拉起二十六元、銀號進錢兌業三十兩、爲五千零八十元、旋乃美滙續報回硬、金號復起賣風、同時銀樓帮亦有塞出、又回跌三十元、金號出某銀號二十兩、爲五千零五十元、午刻證劵帮空頭獲和抵補、重又提高十八元、證券帮五做五十兩、爲五千零六十八元、繼而銀樓帮售予銀號五十兩、爲五千零六十五兀作午收價、結果比上日軋漲三十二元、半天八十元上落、現金號之本脾金售出價、照烚赤高數元、收進减低二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金先高後低</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸五百十元、迨九時四十分掛高五元、十時二十分回小五元、此後無變化、結果平平、計大同行依然懸五百十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低十五元光景</p>
<h3>外滙大戶　絕少動作</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美匯暗市、祇半天買賣變動狹隘、潛勢穩定、投機家大戶仍形觀望、絕少動作、惟一般浮多、乘此盤旋機會、尙願脫手、故結果與隔昨晚收、榮辱不分、至初以海外美英匯兌續吿縮小七五、致開市又呈英平美緊狀態、計四辦士一二五及六元三四三七五、繼因外行對美匯缺乏供意、靜中再現微緊、達六元三二五、入後投機商獲利浮多、頻來脫售、且美行賣意轉濃、故市勢漸形回平、迄至收盤、英金四辦士一二五、美匯六元三七五、較上日相埒、期貨則略硬化、掉期續稍軋攏、</p>
<p>英美期貨軋長</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠期均長二五、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美滬·法等各匯俱平、美對英縮七五、對滬跌一角、對法小半分、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價英金四辦士一二五、英匯六元三四三七五、較之前收、英平美緊〇三一二五、乃滙兌續跌之故、開後因外行缺少賣意、美匯靜中續軟、現貨祇六元三一二五可結、但鮮聞做開、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉大一分半、此後華商乘貴吐予外行本月期美匯六元三一二五、嗣有某華行代港幫扒英塞美、計吸納外行本月份英金四辦士〇七八一二五、而同時出本月份美匯六元三四三七五、約套美英匯兌爲三元七角三分二五、迨十時一刻、投機商續來吐出、同時美行亦供意轉　、故遂告回平、計某行等賣予洋行下月份美匯六元二一八七五、及吐予日洋行五月份英金三辦士九八四三七五、後華商又塞予來加利有利某行等本月份美匯六兀二七五、並下月份美匯六元二五、是以過程期貨反形微鬆、午刻成交漸淸、爲狀殊靜、迄至收盤、英金四辦士一二五、美匯六元七五、本月份英金四辦士〇九三七五、美匯六元三四三七五、下月期英金四辦士四六八七五、美匯六元二五、結果比上日現貨英美均無榮辱、期貨本月份英長〇一五六二五、美硬〇三一二五、下月份巨鬆〇三二二五、美賤〇六二五、午後週六無市、</p>
<p>香港美滙見鬆</p>
<p>香港十六日（週六）電、今晨匯市開盤英匯穩定、美匯動盪不安、英匯美櫃行市不動、申滙現貨升二角五分、爲三百五十九元三角五分，日滙現貨鬆五角、爲九十六元五角、十時十分美滙有微硬模樣、現貨鬆〇六二五、爲二十二元八七五、遠期開出爲二十二元八一二五、十時五十分穩定、美滙現貨續鬆〇六二五、爲二十二元九二七五、遠期不動、仍開二十二元八一二五、十一時三十分吿平、各滙概無變動、午收市面穩定、美滙現貨再鬆〇六二五、爲二十一三元、遠期仍站原盤、申滙現貨續降七角五分、爲三百五十八元半、下午週六無市、</p>
<p>天津英美均長</p>
<p>天津上六日（週六）電、今晨滙市開盤吿平、英滙現貨微鬆〇三一二五、爲三便士八一二五、美滙現貨長〇九三七五、爲五兀九〇五、申滙降一元、爲一百〇七元五角、「聯鈔」暗盤亦昂一元、爲一元零五角、</p>
<p>美金票晨高午低</p>
<p>昨日外幣市况、猶在激盪不定中、尤以美金票爲甚、晨初外匯報緊、同業需求甚殷、市債又曾高至十五元七角六分、後以港電忽起扒英塞美、無疑地看今日英倫電鎊價、或有轉機之望、獲利者遂紛爭傾塞、近午退至十五元五角三分、午後更降爲四角八分、最後爲十五元五角、結果與上日價無分軒輊、反之英金票則漸爲一般所靑睞、香港票及星·荷·安南·羅比·坎·斐律濱等票趨勢均軟、英美金鎊潛勢尙穩、日金票及朝鮮票跌風均戢、前者升至一元三角、後者高至九角九分、昨日市價、英余票漲五分、香港票及新·荷·安南·羅比·坎拿大·斐律濱票等均跌五分、餘俱不動、</p>
<h3>糧食　米價頻跌</h3>
<p>昨日米市繼見跌風、雖早市人心尙堅、囤戶等不肯輕脫、卒以大批途貨洋米不絕湧到、逆料今後市面、在最短期內一時恐乏抬頭希望、浮囤與原根客販、亦傍舟解纜、相隨跟出、市面再度下游、結果各貨行情、又較前步落半元至元砠、而全市成交猶屬寥落、多不過三四千包、原包二號西貢回籠原包四十七元半、小絞原四十七元、先後開出三百多噸後、又乏受主問津、結果現米仍抑價二三四角、期米亦呈軟象云、</p>
<p>糯米去路本細、當此環境貨主扳持無能、並降半元光景、厚薄粳早晚稻等國米、到貨日來雖屬有限、昨由虹口轉出者又祇三五百包、然洋米步步下跌、影響所及、難免牽制、致聞塲外暗盤更覺淸淡、而價繼削元砠、高粳已祇四十七八元、中次貨僅四十四五元、特薄稻四十五六元云云、</p>
<h3>粉麥實銷清淡</h3>
<p>麵粉昨日頗爲鬆濫、蓋自出口禁令撤銷後、客銷迄木活動、平津已向日滿澳洲採辦大宗麵粉、回籠貨市面、頗爲當局注意、所以廠家打出之棧單、一再催促提貨、執貨者不能盡興操縱、惟目下洋麥價格須三十五元、核計粉價每包在十四元以上、故市面脚地未必過弱、統市售開老車牌十四元三角半至三角七分、兵船牌十四元、比前已小一二角、其他概無正式行情、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日亦見萎靡、因粉市趨勢不振、及米價之一再下跌、均足影饗小麥市面、昨蘇州麥祇開二十四元一角半、常錫麥開、十四元、比前又跌五六角、成交共計五六車、</p>
<h3>證券　衆業公所　新訂營業條例　內債仍在上漲</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况仍堅、期待英國之口惠而實至、多方因此壁壘較堅、前因外匯大緊金子在漲而跌落之數、茲已恢復有餘、暫時恐亦未必有鉅大變動、茲聞有加做變相的期貨買賣、但以各方關係太多、恐亦不能遽成事實、足使多方鼓舞忻慰、因可免除　利之負擔也、昨日經過、上午外滙金子均皆和平、公債因之亦安定、甲戊微小、乙丙平平、丁種且未能開出、午後散户需要最湧、順康鴻大亦頗有吃進、久豐賣出爲湧、益昌協大均有出脫、市價乃見堅挺、結果缞又漲起一二角左右、成交约九十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<h3>紗花　粵銷不弱　棉紗大戶續進</h3>
<p>紗市依然堅定、但有一部份心理、因其底盤已　高境、稍有拋空、惟多方因廠方不願開紗、籌碼被其關住、心思看好、所以市面起伏殊大、市塲成交尤旺方市價上下不定、同時粵帮銷路亦屬不弱、於是多頭揑手之貨、始終不棄、四月期雙馬紗成交之增加、今日做開之價、始爲九百八十元、收盤至九百九十二元云、目前紗市因三十二支。四十二支價格甚高、二十支紗亦有連帶關係、所以買者較夥、</p>
<p>現紗晨開承上日虛弱之氣而進、開價爲九百五十六元、此價一開、賀者蜂擁而來、實則都係搶帽子之流拖進、一霎間做至九百七十元、價高獲利者吐出、又復回小幾元、旋聞粵帮對於雙馬需要仍不懈、且大戶紛紛收進、市盤徐徐上升至九百七十一元收盤、以後又見昂升、查半日間成交統計二千二百八十五包、行情二十支雙馬現貨漲二元、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<h3>訂購已覺合算　外棉交易獨旺　姚花又到萬餘包</h3>
<p>本棉交易仍屬不薄、不過美印棉交易、較本棉爲旺、此因購訂合算較為相宜、而本花存貨不厚、採辦又為困難、所以外棉成交增旺矣、蘇北來源計通州花七百〇七包、茲將現棉成交情形列左、</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日市况殊爲靜寂、同業稍有交易、紐奧綸斯幫之在購買、結果收盤價格較之上日近期不動、遠期跌三四磅音、印度昨日述同預測漲二羅比、埃及停市、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉洋行定貨交易、日來頗爲沉悶、各方俱以匯兌之變化不定、交易異常靜寂、廠方則終以購棉紡紗、成本虧折太多、故暫不願開出棉紗而抵進棉花也、故交易淸淡、日方廠商亦甚靜寂、茲將昨日棉市以美匯六元三七五折合送廠價如下、</p>
<p>美商恒達洋行、在浙東採購之棉花、昨晨又到一批、係太古公司黃浦輪、自甬運滬、計一萬零九百八十五包、昨晨七時許抵埠、停靠於法租界本行碼頭、正在起卸中、聞該輪將運來之花卸舉後、續赴寗波裝運、</p>
<h3>疋頭　漂染廠大量　採用國布　南洋限制進口額</h3>
<p>布市勢甚堅穩、國外出口生意、雖因南洋各地許可入口額限制益嚴、致去貨銳减、而國內浙閩滇粵各帮實銷陡盛、本街漯染　大量採用、木廠坯布供求頗能呼應、故近來國布白貨較東疋爲俏俐、昨市各價平定、木街成交細布斜紋怡和粗布及淺色布三百餘件、浙閩帮辦二百餘件、粵帮辦色布·府綢·花布等一百數十件、滇帮辦士林布·綫呢等三千餘疋、皖北蚌埠皖南蕪湖等地、辦細布·細斜·色布·府綢等近五千疋、</p>
<p>東布昨市漲風稍戢、十二磅龍頭細布受老棧單增加械租之影響、囤戶意與關　、進冐轉淡、喊跌每疋一角半、後市一度跌入二十八元以內、但新棧單仍須廿八元一角半、下月份行盤奇昂、同集做開二十九元一角五分、中檔各牌細布及細斜本街染銷殊盛、售盤大致平穩、四君子嗶嘰因本街及漢口帮搜羅現貨頓感缺俏、市塲現出已售開每碼八角五分二五、</p>
<h3>雨衣布昂貴</h3>
<p>雨衣布近來實銷頗呆、市氣依然堅挺、均爲到存有限之故、昨四〇二六開水來、每馬躉比現交開沽十八元半、天祥素色元半、非西貢雙面紗售三元八角、頭號三元九角半、冲麂皮頭號二元、次號一元六七角、英國製造雙面紗雨布售十二元半、毛面十五元、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆驟跌元外</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆市况、突呈劇變、行情驟跌元外、蓋一部人心、先受環境影響、二被豆油挫跌一元三角、以致辦胃暴縮、多頭紛紛出籠、但乏受主、中途雖有乘低殺進、因之市風稍平、然供過於求、勢難支持、給果仍跌、統市祇成交南京豆三百包、價爲一十二元至二十一元五角、蕪湖豆七百餘包、二十三元至二十二元四角、揚州山豆一車、二十一元、丁家州豆三百五十餘包、二十五元五角至二十五元三角、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗糖續見鬆動</h3>
<p>昨日糖市趨勢較平、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白本棧及外棧新到貨均小五角、爲六十二元半、老貨六十二元一角至六十二元、不動、轉口貨仍持原價、太古車白無甚上落、Ｂ嘜西棧六十七元一角、東淺六十六元半、其餘均乏更動、國猶亦呈定勢、成交有限、</p>
<h3>南北貨　蜜棗高貨堅穩</h3>
<p>蜜棗邇來銷胃平常、故普通實發油者至爲疲滯、不上九十元、惟徽貨甫存單薄，較爲堅穩、禿禿售一百二十元至一百十五元、上下檔照例加退、</p>
<h3>蘭竹枝下游</h3>
<p>蘭竹枝因浙東自某方渡江後、去路爲阻、頗受影響、故邇來行盤又見下游、昨市小二元、其勢非俟銷路擴展、不易回振、</p>
<h3>應永玉君建議　定撥款單止付範圍</h3>
<p>銀行界應永玉君、近致函銀行學會略云、銀行撥款單、因受授便利、流通頗廣、但常聞有止付糾紛發生、如勝記與浙江興業銀行、爲此按日刊登質問廣吿、又近有人將綢業銀行二百元之撥款單、塗改爲二萬元之事發生為推廣票據流通並免將來再發生糾紛起見、應規定撥款單掛失止付、僅以水火盜賊或中途遺失爲限、不得任意止付、或規定來人抬頭之撥款單、不得掛失止付、至於開票者、事前應加審愼、票上金額應用正偕大寫字體、且字與字之間、不可多留隙地、最好一律用號碼軋洞機、於票上加軋金額數目，以資愼重、而防塗改云、</p>
<h3>新形勢與生絲業</h3>
<p>— 易之</p>
<p>續十三日</p>
<p>（三）在國內方面、戰事行進到相持階段的現在、「以戰養戰」的政策、勢必愈將倚重、這對於原料的「統制」製絲業的獨佔、也勢必加强壓力、同時相持局面在淪陷區中的特徵、就是流勃戰的較前頻繁、對方「治安力」的愈覺無效、紙這兩點、在收購繭子問題上、已較前更複雜而困難、去年的屈辱和損失、在今年將更鮮保障了、然則中國的生絲業、是否就此將隨人擺佈呢、隨人擺佈就是被人獨佔、那麼怎樣說新形勢、對於生絲業是有利的呢、</p>
<p>原來在這裏並不是絕對無利的、比方說、流動戰的頻繁、就是「統制」的不利、「統制」不利的地方、反統制的自由貿易、就有利、同時「以戰養戰」愈將倚重的時候、就是說侵略者本身愈覺衰弱了、這種衰弱、當然也將反映到「統制」力上去、而這也是有利於生絲業的、並且兩年來上海絲業的復興現象，不論有人說他是病態的、或者是冒險的、而事實上這樣的復業、無論如何總是擊破了人家「統制」回復了自己力量、累積了　向上發展的資金、這是兩年來　可慶幸的地方、也就是今後大可樂觀的地方、這就是今年國內方面的一個預測、</p>
<p>總結起來、在國內那樓「統制」必將加緊、然而它的力量却在衰弱、絲業本身方面呢、它祇有在反統制的經營上、才能生存、（合作與袖手旁銳、就是有利於人家獨佔、並且束手待斃、所以不論在收蘭或者在變絲上面，必要採取經濟游擊的姿態、要有無孔不入的決心、積小勝爲大購的耐性、積極的、勇敢的、毫不妥協的忠於自己的事業發展自己的事業中國淪陷區中的的民族資本，祇有這樣、並且也可以這樣走向光明的道路去的、</p>
<p>新形勢下的生絲業、有着如上幾個優應、從大體上看來、現在正跟着組國的行進、日益趨向有利的一方、不過在此時此地、要把握上這幾項原則、並月必姜跳出投機和冒險妥協自私的陷阱、必要縮小範圍保存實力、然而也要積極爭取經營的自由、突破「統制」陰謀、以儲蓄更多的力量凖備明日的宏圖大展、（完）</p>

<p>舊報新抄　六十七年前　（一二一六）　（見進清同治十二年本報）</p>
<p>— 西國術士演戲記</p>
<p>前夜携綺伴，閒行至金桂軒，則見輿馬喧閙，稠人如織，藍是夜正西國術士登臺演戲也。臺上燈火熒煌，一西女在臺，手奏西樂，和鳴鏘鏘，聽之神往。旣而一獅子頭置桌上，能作人言，桌底懸一明燈，望而知其空空洞洞也，觀者已羣歎其妙！入塲後，忽臺上臺下，火光齊歛，戲臺之後，雙帘倐開。火明，於帘後急視之，則西畫一幅，繪大洋中風景，始而一輪徐徐而過，船中篷帆人物，俱圓活如生。西樂又作，畫徐捲退，但見長天連水，有一輪舟遇風之狀，光閃爍，大有黑風吹海立之勢，讀書者於是歎觀止矣。諸燈齊明、一美女從容偕術士而出，術士衣冠，宛如中國道士形，扶女正立向外，以手向其面畫符，美女即香然如睡。又以兩棍撑其臂，臂立而足懸於虛，任術士之曲仲，無不如志。後又去其一棍，倐如大仙，倐如劍俠，而燈光亦靑黃紅綠，變幻不一觀者已詫爲得未曾有。忽術士念念有詞，自抱女橫臥，又將一棍取去，美女遂如列子御風，懸於空際，戲園中人不禁咸拍手叫絕。片時許，術士抱女下，又畫一符，美女伸欠而醒，宛若行听無事也。乃瞪明而父欽，戲臺之頂，忽飛落流泉碎玉，懸珠滔滔不絕，或急如驟雨，或細若鳴嘶，約半小時，眞奇觀也</p>

<h3>「學」和「問」的重要</h3>
<p>— 君朋</p>
<p>—不害羞，不怕難，不貪懶—</p>
<p>「學問」二字，是連繫的，是互助的。我們無論學習何種學科，都要盡力研究，像最難最不易進步的作文，爲什麼我用了這字，敎師要改掉。這句子爲什麼不通？意思爲什麽太少？爲什麼不切題爲什麽我不能應用平日書上的句子？爲什麽我不能通暢達意？還有像算術，我爲什麼不會應用公式？爲什麼這個應用題我不懂？爲什麼這個算術題這樣做那樣做，都可以求出他的答案，而且是都對的？小朋友？你們有沒有這樣想過？有沒有向自己發問？我們應該知道，在事前必須要「想」，要「想」出他的原理，要能够「應用」否則，我們等於「不學。一面要「努力去學」，一面要「細心去問」「學」的時候要靜心去聽，「問的時候要澈底去問，不可以只知其然，不知其所以然，越不懂越應該去問，越問越會明白。不過，只「學」而不「問」，只「問」而不「學」，是同樣不會進步的，而且沒有好處。你從前失敗的原因，或許是這個緣故，敎師儘管很用勁地講，學生還是毫不用心去聽，就是聽了以後，不能在腦膜上留着深刻的印子，所以你像走馬看花的一樣沒有意義，或者有幾個孩子，雖然讀得出，背得出，講得出，考的國交成績雖是很好，關於作文却不行了，這就是你不能讀「活書」，應用「活書」，你大約沒有問過敎師，什麽叫做「動詞」？什麼叫做「形容詞」什麽叫做「連接詞」？什麼叫做「副詞」？什麽叫做「代名詞」？就是敎師講過，恐忙你不一定會澈底去問，我道你們作文的成績，是最不好的科目中之一，其他常識也不十分好吧！</p>
<p>牛頓，看見蘋菓從樹上落下來，會發明「地心吸力」。富蘭克林，在下雪時，會發明白色反射黑色吸收的光學理論。瓦特，看見水壺沸後，壺蓋振動而發明蒸汽機，……這些科學家，都是因爲「多問多學」，才會發明各種「學理」。我知道你們不肯「問」的原因，不外害羞，怕難，貪懶三種，所以我希望你們趕快打倒這三個「劣根性」，一面「學」一面「問」，那末，你們的「學問」，才會天天進步啊！</p>
<h3>悼念童子軍創辦人貝登堡</h3>
<p>— 揚子江</p>
<p>三月十五日規定楚童子軍節，這是一個很快樂的日子。但是今年不幸却傳來了一個童子軍創辦人貝登堡勳爵逝世的消息。大家知道了總是覺得非常悲痛的。</p>
<p>貝登堡先生是英國倫敦人，小時候在倫敦小學裏讀書，非但是很用功，並且很歡喜運動。十九歲那年，他離開了學校到軍隊裏去服務，做過陸軍中將和騎兵總監等重要的職位。在一九〇七年的二季，貝登堡先生在淘沙白浪島地方，召集了二十五個小朋友，在野外露宿，每天並敎育各種生活的智識，訓育智仁勇的美德。這便是世界最先創辦的第一團童子軍。後來貝登堡便專心辦理童子軍事業，先後創辦了女童軍，幼童軍和羅浮童子軍（比高級更高的童子軍訓練），現在已經很普及於世界各國了。到一九二九年，英王因貝登堡創辦童子軍敎育有功，於是就授給他爵位。</p>
<p>貝登堡先生創辦了童子軍以後，世界上有童子軍的國家已經有五十多國，人數已有三百多萬人。但是不幸得很，貝先生因爲年老的關係，終於在去年在菲洲生病逝世。全世界的童子軍聽到了這個消息，一定是非常悼惜吧。</p>
<h3>兒童健康比賽</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>這次上海難民救濟協會同鄕組勸募委員會，於十六日起，假座新世界遊樂塲舉行遊藝大會。加入的遊藝很多，將以門票收入悉數捐作救難費用。加入的遊藝團體很多，像京劇，話劇，申曲，雜要等，都有表演。而這裏，我們特別要提出的，便是同時還要舉行兒童健康比賽。</p>
<p>照籌備委員會所規定的，凡是中華民國國籍的兒童，自二歲以上，到十二歲以下的，不分性別，都可參加，以十足年齡爲標準。參加比賽的兒童，報名時要繳納登記費一元，領到登記證之後，每天可憑證入塲，不另取資的。報名處就在同孚路一〇二弄六號上海難民救濟協會同鄕組動募委員會內，到十五日截止。大會目十六日開幕後，十七日起，一連比賽五天。比賽完畢之後，第六天就可揭曉，並發給獎金贈品</p>
<p>比賽時評判及檢騐，由該會商請上海難濟分會衛生組全體醫師擔任。至於發給現金獎勵及贈品的辦士是：第一名一人，可得現金國幣一百元，第二名二人，各獎三十元，第三名十人，各獎五元，第四名五十人，各得價値三元的兒童用品。其餘參加的兒童，一概酌量各贈兒童用品及玩具。除了直接向該會報名以外，各學校也代爲鼓動小學生，前往報名，所以人數是相當的多。</p>
<p>小朋友們，大概你們都知道健康問題是非常重要的，有了健全的體格，你們長大起來，他日才能負上重任。在上海這都市裏，關於兒童健康比賽，時常有得舉行的，如果有機會，就是家長不預備領你們去參加，你們自己也可請求家長去報名。參加比賽結果，要是獲獎，是證實了你們的身體相當健康，此後該好好的使身體永久保持這種健康，甚至還要增進。要是名次排得很後，是證實了你們的身體不十分健康，那就要注意衛生的方法，改去這小健康的缺點。所以參加兒童健康比賽是非常有益的，希望大家不要把這件事情忽略才好呢！</p>
<h3>筆画</h3>
<p>— 張子頴作</p>
<h3>黑兄弟　（十）</h3>
<p>— 一木</p>
<p>像這樣一個美麗的早晨，即使不去找尋黃金江，也能使人快樂的。沿瀚山谷一帶，鋪着一條條的霧氣，在這霧氣之外，聳立着一座座的大山——它們那些較低的峭壁蒙在淡灰色的暗影中，幾乎使人看不淸楚，但是霧氣漸漸散開，峭壁上就接觸到了陽光，現出一種很顯明的紅色，那一道道光亮更照見了像槍刺一般的松樹，綠油油地非常動目。在高高的上面又照見了紅紅的岩石，參參差差地幻成種種的形狀，隨處有一抹一抹的雪，在陽光下閃閃地發亮；在很遠的地方，高出於一切的一切，比了早晨的雲史來得淡，瞧去却很淸楚，並且固定得一動也不動，那是積着雪的高峯，正躺在蔚藍色的天空裏。</p>
<p>那黃金江是從較低而沒有雪的高處跳出來，此刻又幾乎蒙在暗雲中，中有最高的地方，浮動著水花似的東西，像烟霚一般慢慢地伸到瀑布的上面，而又在晨風中飄開去了。</p>
<p>漢士的眼睛和思想全都集中在這上面，他忘了路的遠近，只是急急地走去，但他還沒有走過一帶較低的小山，已覺得疲乏得很，更使他驚異的，就是在這小山的上面，發見了一條很大的冰河，正橫在他自己和那黃金江的源頭之間，把他隔開了。他很勇敢的走上了河面，打算渡到對岸去，像這樣渡過一條危險的冰河，還是生平第一次哩。那河面的冰非常的光滑，常有洶湧的水聲，從那冰的裂縫中發出來：這聲音並不是低而單調的，却很響朗，而隨時變動，又是特別的響，像有人在那裏狂歌一般，接着低下去變成了短促而沉鬱的聲音，有時又好像人們在苦痛中不斷的呻吟一樣。漢士經過的地方，那冰碎成了雜亂的千百塊，形狀各各不同，在他眼中瞧去，竟不像是平常的冰塊，却活像奇形怪狀的許多人面，正在向他嘲弄著。在這無數的碎冰上，又發出千百道慘白的光綫，一晃一晃的使得他眼花撩亂起來；而他聽了那洶湧不斷的水聲，耳覺也似乎麻木了，頭也似乎眩暈起來。他一步步的走前去，一步步的加重了他的痛苦；他的脚下不住的伸出一條條新的裂縫來，只聽得冰塊像雷鳴般跌落下去。他處在這危險的環境中，恐怖得什麼似的，好容易逃過了最後的一條裂縫，才筋疲力盡的跌倒在對岸山脚下的草土上。</p>
<p>他在走過冰河的時候，手忙脚亂，早已拋掉了他的食籃，這時再也沒有東西吃，只得撮起一塊塊的碎冰來，放在口中咀嚼着。這麽一來，他倒不覺得口渴了；足足休息了一個鐘頭，才稍稍恢復了他的體力，他因爲佻貪慾驅使着，即忙繼續的向前趕去。</p>

<p>㳺藝界</p>
<h3>橘趣軼聞</h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>前清內廷，於技藝之有供奉，近人所知，厥維優伶；不知乾嘉之際，承平日久，凡遊於藝而可以賞心悅目陶冶性情者，無不設有專班，羅致名家，賞以供奉職術，初不僅戲劇而已也。如清代軼聞所載：「乾嘉時，朝貴盛行奕藝，四方善奕之士，咸集京師，有黃龍士與徐星友者，同時爲內廷供奉」云云，概可見矣。按徐爲黃氏弟子，黃年事技藝，俱長於徐，而機警詭詐，則徐勝於黃，供奉內廷時，徐且因以得官，其事甚趣，徐結納內監，凡內廷舉動，無不預知，一日，徐詣黃曰：君棋實勝於某，惟君勝局已夥，他日御前相較，稍遜一子以全某一日之名何如？」黃笑許之。及期，帝指案上一描金朱匣曰：「此中有物，勝者得之」。黃以爲尋常賞賜也，及奕竟，黃負，布莞爾太息謂黃曰：「汝棋雖勝於彼，其如命不如彼何！」命內侍啟匣出視，則赫然一紙知府文憑也。黃愕然，目睹徐叩首領謝去，蓋徐早已得內監報，故黃竟墮其術中，而以奕得官，亦趣聞也。</p>
<p>徐之後，奕名最噪者，爲梁程施范四國手，及咸同之際又有所謂十八國手。維時，朝政日非，末俗所趨，號稱國手者，無不奔走權門，阿諛朝貴，獨南通李湛源，江都周小松，未嘗同流合汚，湛源亦十八國手之一，平時科頭跣足，與王公大人奕，不欲稍示弱，使人陰賄之，仍如故，甚則大聲疾呼曰：「我故不受賄，奈何出此者！」人亦無如之何。小松曾與曾湘鄕對奕，會意欲厚贐之，及奕，小松授曾九子，裂其碁爲九片，僅乃得活，曾大怒，遂一文不與之。會故好奕而技不甚工，患癬，終身不愈，與人奕，將負，則半身伏案上，癬益癢，膚屑乃盈案，人莫不厭苦之。</p>
<p>奕藝可以陶冶性情，顧鈞心鬥角，殫精竭慮，亦未嘗不可以折損天年，是以好奕之徒，少有克享遐齡者，僧秋航，亦同時國手，同治癸亥，年百十九歲矣，樂西湖景物，與金陵陳伯敏偕至杭州，及明年正月，忽遍辭同人，云將西歸，諸友好乃於元宵前一日爲之祖餞，是日歡呼暢飲，且與衆對奕，局終，斂子入秤曰：「今日之會，難再，即此局亦是絕着。」衆不解，叩之不吿而去翌日，則報秋航逝矣。以棋國手而年至百二十齡，倘亦前所未有；而一局旣終，溘然長逝，寗非佛家所謂尸解中之棋解者歟？</p>
<h3>埃洛爾茀林的採金熱</h3>
<p>— 華志</p>
<p>好萊塢的女明星，統稱為「挖金姑娘」（Golddiggers），這個名稱耳熟能詳，但新近又出了「挖金好漢」，那便是以「英烈傳」「羅賓漢」「江山美人」各片聞名今年當選第六皇座的武俠明星埃洛茀林</p>
<p>但埃洛爾茀林雖有挖金的癖好，却無一次僥悻成功，每次都賠了不少本錢。第一次，有人向他建議說，太平洋中的阿拉斯加島，有一個金鑛，鑛苗已經發現，只是缺少資本，繼續探尋。他便見獵心喜，把美金一萬元和價值七千元的飛機一架，供給那人，不久此人考察回來，已把錢用完，金鑛還沒有發現他只得收回了飛機但埃洛爾茀林並不灰心，第二次他到南美洲的古巴國一小島旅行，聽得該島曾有海盜作亂，某次海盜一羣，被軍艦追趕，逃到岸上，把刦得的珍珠財物一起納在砲管裏，沉入海底，就此跑掉。對於這樣傳奇的故事，他是非常神往的。好容易他央求許多美國人幫助，化了二千美金的代價，果然把大砲從海底撈起來，然而砲管裏所有的乃是價値不及兩百元的光骨石子。</p>
<p>最近一次，埃洛爾茀林聽人說起，橡樹島古時曾爲海盜窩贓所出。有價値不下數百萬元的東西，埋在海底深一百數十尺地方，一百五十年以來，已有不少人在開發，但因坑洞常被海水灌沒，沒有結果。他便又想作孤注一擲，要和加拿大一個企業合作社接洽，買地一塊，實行開發，企圖貫澈他的黃金夢。</p>
<h3>彈詞二十種</h3>

<p>珍珠塔是許多彈詞脚本中最成功的一種。</p>
<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐藝雲</p>
<p>青石山之八個馬童</p>
<p>青石山本來是一齣吉祥武劇，主角並不十分繁重，不過就是好在生旦凈丑各有顯其所長的機會，實在稱得起是一齣大羣戲，所以就覺得非常熱鬧了。某歲値小樓南來，又適逢海上五班大會串的義務戲，那時南方幾位著名武生全在上海，派戲的人着實有些爲難，於是就想出這齣「全本靑石山」來。由小樓飾關平，一桿旗飾九尾狐狸，王永利去倉子，何金壽去王法官，于振庭去呂祖，三麻子扮關帝，而以李春來夏月潤趙如泉蓋叫天趙小廉張德俊應寳蓮陳俊庭道八位著名武生扮演八個馬童。表面上看來固是很捧小樓，然而實際上總還是替三老板增身價。因爲馬童是跟隨聖帝出塲的，及至關公一上塲，這八位勇猛短打武生馬前馬後亂翻筋斗，直把台下的觀衆眼睛都攪花啦？要不是大舞台的台子大，這幾位捨命王幾乎要翻到台下去了。要論此八人的年齡，當以春來最長（現若在世。當爲八旬左右。）次則趙君玉之父小廉現仍健在，今年已七十歲矣。再次則夏老八（月潤）張德俊蓋叫天趙如泉四人，當時以陳俊庭應寳蓮爲最幼，但今皆年近六旬矣。時光如逝，轉瞬將三十年，昔時馳騁歌壇者今均成白髮老翁，或已早作異物，殊令人有滄桑之感也。</p>

<p>蔡孑民先生已於本年三月五日在港近世了！我因為離開北大以後，仍常和他討論學術，所以目問很能認識他的一切。古人以立德立功立言為三不朽，能有其一，已覺不易；今先生對此三者，竟能兼長，在中國歷史上，實極罕見，豈僅堪稱「一代宗師」而已現在試略述其各種特點，以作紀念，並當一哭！</p>
<p>學問方面</p>
<p>關於這一方面，現分爲四點，述之於左：</p>
<p>（一）思想的前進——先生的思想，非常前進。在政治方面，主張最大多數最大幸福的最良政治，（見對於敎育方針之意見）應用於國際的互助主義。（見大戰與哲學）在經濟方面，主張發財產與社會主義。（見後面倫理部分）在教育方面，主張美育主義，（見蔡孑民先生言行錄）脫離政黨敎會的獨立敎育。（見新敎育四卷三期與中華敎育界十一卷十期）在倫理方面，主張進化的世界主義，（見世界與人生觀）男女道德性慾絕對平等主義；（見蔡孑民先生言行錄傳略）他一直到了民國十九年四月間，在立法院邀請第三屆全國敎育會議全體會員餐叙的席上，還主張「廢姓氏婚姻家庭的理想新村」。（見同上年月十九日申報及各報）先生以黨國元老之尊，垂老，而其思想猶向前進，實爲一般思想跟年齡而老，跟地位而移者，所萬小可及。又可見他從來均站在時代的前面，而不甘落伍。此正可表示其有一貫的精神，澈底的見解。</p>
<p>（二）學問的廣博——先生是前消的進士翰林，所以長於中國文，哲……諸學；後來到德·法各國留學，硏究西洋的哲學，美學，史學，文學，敎育學……等，曾受贈博士學位。他譯著的專書，以關於哲學，倫理學，文學方面者爲多，多由商務印書館印行。論文則散見於各報章雜誌，與蔡孑民先生言行錄。</p>
<p>（三）硏究的認眞——先生治學，很認眞，並富有懷疑的精神，如在淸末著中國倫理學史，已以堯舜等爲儒家的理想人物；後來著石頭記索隱，更多用力，竟發見「作者持民族主義甚摯，書中本事，在弔明之亡，揭淸之失，而尤於漢族名士仕淸者寓痛惜之意」。又守舊派文豪林紓，致書先生，致謂北大，說：「乃近來尤有所擊新道德者，斥父母爲自感情慾，於已無恩。此語曾一見之隨園文中，僕方以爲擬不於倫，斥袁枚為狂謬；圖竟有用為講學者，人頭　鳴，辯不屑辯，「置之可也」。先生復書，謂「斥父母爲自感情慾，於已無恩」一類論調，係出於後漢書孔融傳，路粹枉狀奏融，而非出於袁隨園。即此已可想見先生並不像林琴南那般學者的隨便引證，來妄駡人了！一般舊學者的研究學問，往往忽略方法；在先生却不以爲然，而很正確的認：方法重於具體的學問。（詳見先生作的蔡尚思著中國思想研究法序）</p>
<p>（四）態度的公正——先生對於年少於己的友朋和學生，非常謙虛；如胡適之諸學者，固爲先生所看重；而對於自己的學生，也常「不恥下問」，如民國二十三年，我因在南京國學圖書館搜集「中國史料」，常到中央硏究院總辦事處去看他，他爲了認眞，竟也以「臣罪當誅兮天王聖明等語出於何書何文」問我，這是多麽虛心呀！他對於我十餘年來搜獲的「中國思想史料」約三百萬言、很關懷，在抗戰以後，來信常提到牠。他去年讀到拙著「中國思想硏究法」一書，也來書表示欣慰！我的所以能够有點貢獻，頗多由於先生的獎勵。又如梁任公先生和先生的見解派別多不四，甚至相反；但先生於梁先生逝世時，以梁氏在學術上有大貢獻，特向中央政府提義下令褒揚。（未被中央採納）這種大公無私的態度，在當代學者與要人中，實不多見。</p>
<p>此爲蔡先生早年時的玉照。其時東京同盟會成立，由何海樵君介紹蔡先生入同盟會，其後又介紹其入暗殺團。暗殺須用炸彈，先生以爲此事應有精於化學者參加，方得事半功倍，乃介紹鍾憲　君入會，以鍾君精化學，且可於科學儀器館購儀器藥品，不令人懷疑也。炸彈成後，以無彈殼爲憾，適黃克强蒯若木諸君，先後從東京到上海，携來彈殼携製成之發見不能，賃屋作設法改良任，而經及其弟元十餘枚，由孫少侯君彈至南京僻處試之，用。其後有楊篤生君機關，早夕研究，期彈殼。經費由孫君担營機關，則由蔡先生康先生担任。其時蔡先生又介紹其鄉多人入會。常楊篤生君北上時，抵保定，遇吳樾君，一見如故，即介紹其入會。未幾，出洋考察憲政之五大臣，在車站遇中國第一枚炸彈。投彈者爲吳樾，蔡先生知彈必爲楊君所製，恐其不能出京。孫少侯君乃託事北上，拯救出險。常蔡先生任愛國女校校長時，灌輸女界以新思想，循循善誘，藍蔡先生爲最早提倡女權中之一人也。</p>
<p>功業方面</p>
<p>關於這一方面，彰彰在人耳目，無需我來多談；如舉其要，則有下列三點：</p>
<p>（一）教育的功業——先生的辦敎育，最有成績。此種成績，先表現於國立北京大學，後表現於國立中央硏究院。他任北京大學校長時，對於敎職員方面，純抱人才主義，只問學問能力，不問資格年齡，從復辟黨到共產黨，都可容納；從國學到西學，都要注重。……對於學生方面，注重自由硏究，專門研究，務使各有所長，各有所用。結果，全國政。敎各界，北大學生都佔着重要的地位。先生並把敎育政治打成一片，以學校監察政府，領導員生從事活動，於是遂產生了中國運動史上最爲偉大的「五四運動」北京大學的所以能成爲中國的領袖學府，也由於上述各點。總而言之：沒有先生，北京大學便不會如此偉大；沒有偉大的北京大學，中國敎育文化便不會有如今的可觀。先生後來改任中央研究院院長，努力科學事業，與新中國的建設，也很有關係。</p>
<p>（二）政治的功業——民國成立，先生首任臨時政府的教育總長；國民革命成功，先生也首任國民政府的敎育部長；（當時改名大學院）在任多所開創與建樹，誠不愧爲民國以來敎育行政的唯一領袖。此外尙任中央黨部監察委員，國民政府委員，常務委員，監察院長，司法部長等要職。</p>
<p>（三）革命的功業——先生在淸末，已和章太炎吳稚暉諸氏辦報鼓吹革命，排斥滿淸；後來更加入國民黨，反對北洋軍閥政府。</p>
<p>人格方面</p>
<p>（一）私德——先生生平很正經樸素，旣沒有一般下等的嗜好；而對於住方面，也沒有在大都市裏自建過一宅，這是異於一般權實的第一點。先生自民元以來，雖歷任要職，仕途算得相當順利；但他常爲正義，已就的或憤而辭去，未就的或憤而不受，這是異於一般官僚政客的第二點。先生很溫和誠懇，力所能及，有求必應，一點架干也沒有，這是異於一般有地位者的第三點。至其大公無私，寬容大量，而無門戶之見，意氣之爭，已在上面「態度的公正」，與「敎育的功業」兩節中略述及之。</p>
<p>（二）愛國——先生在清末革命與五四運動，旣都從愛國心出發；現據報載任鴻雋氏談話，又謂：「此次致病之由，雖云年老體弱；然平時對於國事之憂慮，……當為其最大原因。數月前尙有「滿江紅……歌」發表，愛國之切，情見乎詞。……」（見三月六日申報）</p>
<p>（三）人權——先生是身在政府，心在人民。人權爲重，己祿爲輕。充滿表現着愛護公理，主持正義，與大無畏，肯犧牲的精神，和一般以做官爲目的，隨地位而轉移的人，相去眞不可以道里計！</p>
<h3>蔡先生遺言錄</h3>
<p>人類之義務，爲　倫不爲小己；爲將來不爲現在，爲精神的愉快，而非爲體磈之享受。</p>
<p>凡事空話不如實行，大的要從小的做起。</p>
<p>以正當之娛樂，易不正當之娛樂，庶於道德無腐，而於身體有益。</p>
<p>人能袪迷信而持理信，則可以省無謂之營求及希冀，以專力於有益社會之事業，而日有進步矣。</p>
<p>人以自衛能力不平等而生强弱，人以自存力不平等而生貧富，有强弱貧富，而彼我差別之見起，弱者貧者，苦於幸福之不足，而營求之意識起。有人我則於現象中有種種之界劃，而與實體違。而營求則當其未遂，為無已之痛苦，及其旣遂，為過量之要索，循環於現象之中，而與實體隔，能劑其平，則肉體之享受，純任自然，而意識界之營求免，人我之見亦化。</p>
<p>一種社會，無論小之若家庭，若商店，大之若國家，必須此一社會之各人，皆與社會有休戚相關之情狀，且深知此社會之性質，而各盡共一責任，故無人不常學，而亦無時不當學也。</p>
<p>以前的成效，萬不要引以爲功，以前的損失，也不必再作無益的愧悔，打定主義，專心增進學識，修養道德，鍛鍊身體，如有餘暇，可以服務社會，担負指導平民的責任，預備將來解決中國的——現在不能解決——大問題。</p>
<p>吾國以病夫聞於世也久矣，振而起之，其必由日新又新之思想，普及於人人，而非恃一手一足之烈。</p>
<p>孤立而自營，則凍餒且或難免，合業人之力以營之，而幸福之生涯，文明之事業，始有可言。</p>
<p>民權之趨勢，若決江河，沛然莫禦。</p>
<p>當蔡先生在中西學堂做監督的時候，其妻病故。媒人紛紛前來替蔡先生做媒，蔡先生提出五項條件：（一）女子須不纒者。（二）須識字者。（三）男子不娶妾。（四）男死後，女可再嫁。（五）夫婦如不相合，可離婚。其時思想頭固，看了後面兩條，無不却走，過了一年，始與黃爾軒先生之女黃世振女士結婚。結婚時不懸三星畫軸，而以一紅幛綴「孔子」二大字代之。閙房則以演說會代之。後黃女士又去世。蔡先生又與周養卷女士結婚。此爲祭先生與周養卷結婚時之影。</p>

<h3>蔡孑民先生</h3>
<p>— 古楳</p>
<p>——紀念社會教育的元勛——</p>
<p>自從蔡孑民先生逝世的消息傳佈後，國內外的人士，莫不同聲哀悼！的確，蔡先生對於社會國家和敎育學術，都有很多貢獻，大家哀悼他，實在是表示紀念他的功績。我們站在社會敎育的立塲，更覺得蔡先生是一個社會敎育的元勛，需要深切地紀念他。</p>
<p>我們看到現在中國的社會敎育有相當的進展，再想到中國的社會敎育還有很多沒有開發的園地，便覺得需要一個有力的社會敎育行政機關來策劃推動。而不曉得一十九年前中華民國建立的時候，蔡先生對於這點，就出了一番很大的力量——堅決地主張在敎育部設置社會敎育司，主管全國社會敎育行政。</p>
<p>當辛亥革命的時候，蔡先生還在歐洲考察敎育。他聽見武昌起義，即行回國。等到南京臨時政府成立，他就出任敎育部部長。於是他根據在外國考察的結果，覺得各國社會教育的發達，莫不賴着敎育行政的力量去策劃推動。因此他深信敎育行政的負任，不僅在敎育學校以內的靑年，並須兼顧到多數年長失學的成人。所以草擬官制（敎育部組織法）的時候，他便堅決地主張在傳統的普通敎育司和專門敎育司之外，特設社會敎育司，主管社會敎育行政事宜，以便策劃推動全國的社會敎育，糾正過去教育畸形發展（專重學校敎育）的流弊。後來該制縱被參議院修改了一部分，但總算大體通過了，並在敎育部中成立一個專門主管社會敎育的社會敎育司，相沿到現在，能够推動全國的社會敎育，和學校敎育共同發展。這點，確是蔡先生的功勞，我們不能不追念他的。</p>
<p>自然，我們追念蔡先生創設社會敎育司的功勞，並不是因爲他能「設官制祿」，養活多少司長科員；而是因爲有了專門主管的社會敎育行政機關，可以運用行政的力量來發展社會敎育，使全國千百萬沒有機會進學校的人們都能受到少許的敎育，特別是失學的成年民衆。譬如近年來各省市成年失學民衆補習敎育的實施，便是完全由社會敎育司策動的；最顯明的如擬訂計劃，籌措接費，訓練人員，監督和指導經都全賴社會敎育行政機關的力量才能辦到。而這種行政機關的創設，便是蔡先生的功勞。</p>
<p>此外蔡先生對於民衆的語文改革，也有很大的功勞。如民初的切音字母，民六的國語研究，民十七的國語羅馬字，他都曾經盡了一番力量，使民衆的語文漸漸改革到容易學習的地步。這點也是中國社會敎育的重大問題，而蔡先生早已注意到了，並且盡力去設法改革。</p>
<p>蔡先生對於中國社會敎育旣有道樣的貢獻，所以民國二十年中國社會敎育社成立後，即推他爲名譽理事，表示他對於社會敎育的貢獻。如今蔡先生浙世了，我們社會敎育界同人應有更進一層的紀念才好。</p>
<h3>蔡孑民先生與北大</h3>
<p>— 巧</p>
<p>蔡先生與北大發生關係是在民國五年，那時先生尙在法國，由敎育部電召而回國任北人校長的。因爲那時的北大在外界言論上，實在是太不好了，而其內部的情形，委實也太腐敗了，非有先生回來整頓一下是不行的了，同時先生亦不避艱難辛苦而應允担任了這一重任。並聘請陳仲甫（獨秀）先生任文科學長，夏浮筠先生任理科學長，及沈尹默·劉半農等先生担任敎授。</p>
<p>先生在北大第一件着手辦理的是「改革學生的觀念」，因爲北大學生一向的習慣是對學問並沒有什麼興會，只俟求學年限滿後，得到一張畢業文憑，並且尤注重在畢業以後的出路問題；這當然是絕大的錯誤，所以當先生在校第一次演說時，就說明：「大學學生，當以硏究學術爲天職，不當以大學爲升官發財之階梯」。</p>
<p>北大本設有文理工法商五科，而那時的北洋大學亦有工法兩科之設，另外北京還有國立的工業專門學校，先生以爲無此重複的必要，所以主張北大的工科歸併北洋，而北洋的法科則即期停辦，後來經過數度的商磋，得北洋大學校長的同意及敎育部的核准，不久便把北大的土木工與鑛冶工併入北洋大學去了。</p>
<p>先生曾說：「學生在學校裏面，應以求學爲最大目的，不應有何等政治的組織。其年有二十歲以上者，對於政治有特殊興趣者，可以個人資格，參加政治團體，不必牽涉學校。」所以果然於民國八年五月四日，北京學生有不簽字於巴黎和約與罷免親目派曹·陸·張的主張，而釀成全國皆知的五四學生運動。其時先生因有將運動學生保持地位嫌疑便引咎辭職了。可是五四運動旣吿完成，一切事情皆已平息，唯獨北大校長的辭職問題，又起糾紛，轉輾數月，雖有政府任命胡次珊先生繼任，而爲學生們所反對，結果仍由先生應允復任，一塲糾粉，遂吿解決。</p>
<p>又先生在北大開學術界上新紀元的一件事，便是男女同校；先生索主男女平等；民國九年，有女學生請求進校，故於暑假北大就正式招收女生了。隨即有許多人問先生：「兼收女生乃係新法，何弗先請敎部核准耶？」先生答道：「敎部對大學，並無專收男生之規定，以前女生不來請求入學，故自無女生，今旣有女學生請求進校，且程度又不比男子爲弱，大學自無拒絕的理由」。男女同校之風，即在那時便開始了。</p>
<h3>蔡孑民先生的軼事</h3>
<p>— 糜若拙</p>
<p>淸末先生跟隨總理，奔走四海，鼓吹革命，並與徐錫麟，章太炎，秋瑾等組織光復會，並定口號：「黃河源溯浙江潮，衛我中華漢族豪，莫使滿胡留片甲，軒轅神胄是天驕。」民國兀年，革命成功，先生任敎育總長職，尤爲當時人士所器重，在官人等紛紛晋謁道賀；會有賀客數人，身着畢挺禮服，正擬進門祝賀，已見先生出門相迎，先生自身穿短襖，雙手盡爲皂沫染，邊揩邊迎，這時賀客頗覺不好意思，窘狀滿面，先生早就會意說道：「沒關係，沒關係，有勞諸位了，請裏邊坐；我爲着沒事，就舊事重作，隨便洗洗衣服（因先生在求學時代，衣服都是自己洗的）祗可是難爲諸君了」。我們見此，不期而然的便連想到蔡先生常說的「勞工神聖」的一旬話了。</p>
<p>戰通地信</p>
<h3>杭平道上一支奇軍　經濟反對鎖巡邏隊</h3>
<p>— 葉舟</p>
<p>我最初在杭平公路的黃灣角里堰間，發現了這麽一支「奇軍」小覺懷疑：道是「正規軍」嗎？不是，正現軍應該有嚴整的軍容的！道是「游擊隊」嗎？又不是，看樣子他們不像是慣於「臨陣作戰」的！這或者是「靑年團」以及「少年營」了，又立刻被我看出，其中是老壯咸有的！</p>
<p>我爲了懷疑，我追趕這支「奇軍」，直過黃灣小學原址，經絲廠，抄過黃灣市梢，急行里多，到達黃灣海濱的鹽塲，他們停住了，我也停住了，看見一面大旗，揷在潮濕的鹽泥上，上面寫的是：「經濟反封銷巡遜隊」字樣，旁邊還有一行小字：「浙西第十一支隊第五小隊」。</p>
<p>我悄悄地招呼一個面貌和善的靑年，低聲問他：</p>
<p>「道個巡邏隊時常來嗎」</p>
<p>他用懷疑目光注視我，不願回答。我連忙聲明說：「請放心！我自己是這一帶的人，新近方從上海回來，所以故鄕的一切情形，完全隔膜了！」我說的話完全用海寗口音。</p>
<p>他點點頭，先問我：「黃灣鎭是的張××先生你相識嗎</p>
<p>怎麼不相識？不信你可去問，還是我向來的朋友呢</p>
<p>「那末，我吿訴你！」他小心翼翼地說：「他們是時常來的，但到黃灣來的不一定是第五小隊，我想這一定是組織上的番號，並不限定地域吧！」</p>
<p>我聽他說出「番號」，「地域」等術語，不禁大喜地問：「你一定進過中學？」他先詢問了我的名字，立刻微笑着說：「我早知先生的各字！我早知先生的名字！我自己喚做顧××，在海寗縣中讀過一年多，却沒有畢業。」</p>
<p>我連忙說：「請你吿訴我這巡邏隊的簡略情况，可以嗎？」</p>
<p>「有什麼不可以！」他遙指一座鹽竉說，「我們去坐着談吧！」</p>
<p>我因爲預備上午還想趕到角里堰，急於要他速吿，他很有次序地報告我聽：——</p>
<p>『我們浙西一部份淪陷後，浙江省政府當局，立刻通令所屬各縣，組織「經濟反封鎖巡邏隊」，在米淪陷各縣，劃分爲區，設立「支隊」，支隊下便是「小隊」；而設總隊部於於潛。</p>
<p>『他們的任務，破壞日方　經濟封鎖的陰謀，防杜內地資財偷運入「淪陷區域」爲人利用，也防杜「淪陷區域」的劣貨漏入內地暢銷。他們像從前的「緝私隊」緝查「私鹽」似的，終日巡查着各處海岸關防，不使「走漏」一處；在必要時，他們需要「武力彈壓」，所以他們也有「槍」！</p>
<p>『他們的前身，有的是緝私隊改組，也有用保衛團改組，但大半是有志的靑年和壯丁，自動加入，所以，這些隊伍中「智識份子」也不少呢！</p>
<p>「現在，這一運動已發展到了我們浙西已淪陷各縣，在杭州，在嘉興，在平湖，聽說都已成立了支隊部，請想啊，這一隊是「浙西十二支隊第五小隊」，大槪浙西「游擊區域」，奸僞雜陳，情形比較複雜，不得不多設幾個支隊部；我們浙西僅「淪陷」了十四縣一市，看來倒是每一縣有一個支隊部呢！或者我們海寗縣和近在咫尺間的海鹽縣，都有其支隊部，可惜我少於外出，不能明吿詳情於張先生了！但一支隊竟已有五小隊，恐怕還不祇此數，以每隊二十人計，這支巡邏隊的力量也確是可觀了！」</p>
<p>我非凡滿意這位靑年的口齒流利，應答得條縷分析，不可多得；我又問：「那末，查獲的私貨劣貨如何處置？」他簡捷地回答我：「充公，」</p>
<p>臨別，我要問問他失學原因，他感嘆地說：「我失學多年了！倒和這次抗戰無關，是家庭經濟力的不勝負擔……」</p>
<p>一路上，我惦念着這「經濟反封鎖巡邏隊」，也惦念着這一個誠樸可愛的「有爲靑年」</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops on the South Bank of the Yong River Driven Back After Attacking East from Pumu; Japanese Reinforcements from Xiaodong and Datang Suffer 500 Fatalities; Chinese Troops in Chao-Shan Reclaim Four Strongholds Including the Cannon Platform City</h3>
<p>Liuzhou, 14th afternoon—Over 1,000 Japanese soldiers, a combined force of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, attacked east from Tingziwei on the south bank of the Yong River, passing through Pumu and Liuxu towards the Gongxi He area. They were met with a fierce head-on assault by Chinese forces, suffering heavy casualties. On the same day, another group attacked Diliwei, but were routed by Chinese forces, abandoning over a hundred bodies and retreating southward. After reclaiming Daluling, Chinese troops swept eastward, eliminating over 200 Japanese soldiers and destroying over ten Japanese vehicles. Subsequently, the Japanese reinforced with a large force from Xiaodong, including three heavy artillery pieces and twenty-nine light artillery pieces, covered by multiple Japanese aircraft, launching a fierce assault on the Chinese. The Japanese also transported troops from Datang to reinforce, attempting a pincer attack, leading to fierce battles in the Tianbanling area. Chinese officers and soldiers displayed high morale, engaging in fierce close combat. By the morning of the 13th, over 500 Japanese soldiers had been killed and over twenty Japanese vehicles destroyed. Fighting continued into the afternoon. (16th dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin—On the morning of the 12th, Chinese troops in the Chao-Shan area reclaimed the Cannon Platform City and Taoshan. At 3:00 PM, they continued to reclaim Xiaosangpu Mountain and Denggang and other strongholds, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese. (16th dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing—On the evening of the 13th, Chinese troops launched an attack on Japanese forces entrenched in Zini and Baisha northeast of Xinhui, inflicting heavy damage. The Japanese troops retreated into Xinhui city, refraining from engaging in battle. Chinese troops destroyed all Japanese barracks, fortifications, and transportation equipment. (15th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing—Although the Japanese side claims that fighting has resumed on the Guinan front, the Chinese military dispatch received today from the Nanning area states that the situation there is relatively calm, with only minor skirmishes occurring north of Nanning and along the southern highway. (16th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin—On the afternoon of the 12th, a Japanese reconnaissance unit from Ertang on the Yongbin Road engaged in activities towards Santang, but was repulsed by Chinese forces. (15th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops Active Around Beiping</h3>
<p>Somewhere in Hebei—Chinese troops around Beiping have been extremely active recently. On the 13th and 14th, they engaged in fierce battles near Pingxi Zhaizhai, northwest of Daan Mountain, at Xiaohanling, Laohudong, Shanshen Temple, and the Luopoling area with Japanese troops attacking from Liangxiang, Nankou, and Huailai counties. Chinese troops bravely charged and killed over half of the Japanese soldiers. A portion of the troops encircled the Japanese rear, completing an encirclement. The Japanese troops were extremely frightened and attempted to break through several times without success. They are currently being annihilated. (16th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Wei Lihuang Firmly Defends Zhongtiao Mountain; Japanese Offensive Fails Nine Times; Japanese Unable to Consolidate Positions in Shanxi; Safety of Northwestern Provinces Guaranteed; Chiang Kai-shek Awards Wei First-Class Certificate</h3>
<p>Chongqing—Chongqing has received a lengthy letter from a certain base of Chinese forces in Zhongtiao Mountain, southeastern Shanxi Province, describing the situation of the Chinese troops defending Zhongtiao Mountain. It stated that the Japanese army feels this area to be extremely troublesome, because the Japanese army launched nine offensives, but the Chinese army still defends that mountain. Chairman Chiang awarded a first-class certificate to General Wei Lihuang, commander of the Chinese forces in the Zhongtiao Mountain area, highlighting the importance of the area. General Wei led his troops to firmly defend Zhongtiao Mountain, preventing the Japanese army from consolidating its positions in Shanxi, thus preventing them from crossing the Yellow River and attacking Gansu and Shaanxi. Therefore, the safety of the northwestern provinces is truly dependent on the ability of the Chinese troops defending this vital mountain range. This mountain range starts from Yuanqu in the east, stretches westward along the north bank of the Yellow River, and reaches Jianxi (transliteration). The defending troops are mostly Sichuan soldiers. Chinese artillery units on the south bank of the Yellow River repeatedly bombard the Japanese troops concentrated on the north bank, greatly assisting the Chinese troops in Zhongtiao Mountain. The Japanese army is currently striving to improve transportation and build roads into the mountains. Construction is underway to connect the Xia County and Anyi highways to facilitate military operations, but the Chinese army is using various methods to obstruct them. The Japanese army is also conducting propaganda in the area, distributing cartoons and newspapers. The highest peak of Zhongtiao Mountain is Lianhuatai, which is firmly defended by the Chinese army. The Chinese troops in the area are deeply confident that they will defeat all Japanese attempts to occupy the mountain or cross the Yellow River. The southeastern part of Shanxi is divided into the first and second districts of Zhongtiao Mountain. The second district is almost undeveloped, being a primitive forest with no roads and many wild animals. The first district has been developed over the past twenty years, and cultivated land with residents now accounts for sixty percent of the total area. Most of the residents in the mountains are from Henan and Shaanxi provinces. Every day, they can be seen cultivating fields on the eighty-degree slopes of the mountains. They have not been exposed to outside civilization, so their cultural level is very low. Women have bound feet and are regarded as part of the family property. Those who own many women and cattle are called rich. There are no graves to be found anywhere in the mountains. The corpses are buried underground, and grains are planted on top to avoid wasting precious land. The main agricultural products are barley, corn, and wheat. It is estimated that a good harvest in one year is enough to feed the people in the area for three years. The wheat harvest in June last year was destroyed due to the Japanese invasion. Now, most people eat corn. Sheep herding is a secondary occupation for the mountain people. On the steep mountain slopes, flocks of sheep graze leisurely, forgetting the war. Cattle are the most important possession of the farmers, with each household owning two or three heads. A calf is worth fifty yuan, while a large one is worth three hundred yuan. Their size is comparable to the water buffalo seen in Chongqing. The biggest loss suffered by the farmers in the war is the seizure of their cattle by the Japanese army to transport livestock and food. It is estimated that the farmers have lost 20,000 head of cattle in the two years of war. Therefore, when the farmers have finished planting, the Chinese military authorities help them move the cattle to safe areas. Yuncheng in Zhongtiao Mountain is a major salt production area in North China, comparable to Huaicheng in northern Jiangsu. The salt produced supplies the provinces of Shanxi, Henan, Gansu, Shaanxi, and Qinghai. Mountain springs gush down, with the water containing salt. Farmers build small dams to collect the salt water and dry it in the sun. After the Japanese occupied Yuncheng, the northwestern provinces faced a serious problem of salt shortage. (16th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Xingji—Fierce battles have been taking place in southern Shanxi for days. (1) On the night of the 9th, the Chinese launched a surprise attack on the Japanese troops in Houwang, Zhangdian, and Ershililing, fighting fiercely until the morning of the 10th, killing hundreds of Japanese soldiers. At the same time, Japanese troops from Yicheng, attempting to contain Chinese forces, harassed Longbei Town from Shangxiaganquan along the Yi-Qin Highway, but were soundly defeated by the Chinese and retreated in disarray.

<h3>Military Affairs Commission Announces Weekly War Situation (March 9th to 15th)</h3>
<p>Chongqing—A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated that since this week (March 9th to 15th), the Japanese troops on the northern and southern battlefields have been constantly attacked by Chinese forces and are trapped in a dilemma. The Japanese in Qiongdong, Chao-Shan, and other places in Guangdong Province have attempted to move and have engaged in extensive false propaganda in the hope of saving their failing war situation, but have ultimately failed. The Chinese are advancing bravely on all fronts. The more important aspects of the combat operations are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong Province—The fighting has been quite fierce this week. The Japanese troops invading Qiongdong by various routes were lured into the mountains and severely attacked, suffering heavy casualties. In the Zhongshan area, Chinese troops have been fiercely attacking the Japanese along the Shiqi-Guanzha and Shiqi-Beidieshi highways, inflicting heavy damage. Japanese reinforcements were counterattacked by the Chinese troops, suffering many casualties. On the evening of the 9th, Chinese troops launched a fierce attack on Xinhui along the Xinhe Road, killing countless Japanese soldiers in the Mashan, Fengshan, and Zhonggongshan areas. The Japanese rear is in a state of emergency and panic. As for the Japanese in Chao-Shan, they have been attempting to attack Jieyang along two routes, the northern route from Chao'an along Aoding Mountain, Datouling, and Guxiang, and the southern route from Anbu along Sangpu and Xiapu Mountains. They were ambushed by Chinese forces from the flanks, cutting the Japanese into several sections. The Japanese troops collapsed and retreated, and their attempt to attack Jieyang has been completely thwarted by the Chinese forces.</p>
<p>Guinan—The Yong-Wu Highway between Nanning and Gaofengao, and the Yong-Bin Highway between Nanning Er and Santang, are under close observation by the Chinese. Chinese troops have been attacking the Japanese for days, reclaiming over ten strongholds including Lingqi, Sanchaling, Xiziling, Tongguling, Gaobiaoling, and Daluling, killing over a thousand Japanese soldiers. They are continuing to attack constantly, and the area is completely controlled by the Chinese. The Japanese troops trapped in Nanning are extremely panicked. The Japanese troops who</p>
<p>Suisao—launched a large-scale attack from places like Pinglin Temple in the Zhihe area, consisting of several thousand infantry, cavalry, and artillery, have been under attack from Chinese forces from all directions since last week. Important strongholds like Monkey Mountain, Jiuligang, Wushan, Bailanggang, Dayanpo, Xiejiaogang, Dagudian, Lengjiawan, Dawanglong, Luoyangdian, and Guanzhuangdian have been recovered, killing over two thousand Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese troops retreated in disarray along their original routes. In addition,</p>
<p>Wuhan—near the area, a portion of the Chinese army once attacked the Japanese concession in Hankou and destroyed many Japanese facilities. The Japanese were in a state of panic.</p>
<p>Southeast Shanxi—Chinese troops have been using mobile tactics to attack the Japanese for days, advancing on Huguan and besieging Changzi. Many Japanese outposts around Huguan have been captured by the Chinese. The Japanese are in extreme disarray. Chinese troops in southern Shanxi have been attacking the Japanese in Houwang, Zhangdian, southeast Anyi, Ershililing, and south Xiexian for days, killing many Japanese soldiers. The fighting on both sides of the Tongpu Railway is still fierce. The Chinese have been attacking from the east and west, repeatedly cutting the railway line. The northern section is currently impassable.</p>
<p>North Henan—Chinese troops have once again completely destroyed Japanese transportation. In southern Henan, the Japanese forces besieging Dongwulidian in Xinyang have been dealt another major blow.</p>
<p>Northern Jiangsu—Over 1,300 Japanese infantry, cavalry, and artillery troops from Caobaji, Daxujia, Damiao, and Pantang Village in Xuzhou have been attacking the area east of Xuzhou for days. The Chinese have been engaging in fierce close combat after encircling and attacking them, killing many Japanese soldiers. Another unit of Chinese troops launched a fierce attack on the Japanese rear, destroying most of the bridges in the area east of the artillery station on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, cutting off Japanese transportation. As for</p>
<p>Shandong Province—many puppet troops have been rebelling and killing Japanese soldiers for days. In the Guandong area, there are Wu Fenglin, Ma Jili, Zhu Xiangxian, Zhang Baoshan, and in the southern Shandong area, there are Li Liansan's various units, totaling over 1,400 men, with over 1,170 rifles and over 20 light and heavy machine guns. The Japanese conspiracy to use Chinese to control Chinese has completely failed. In addition,</p>
<p>Western Suiyuan—The Japanese troops trapped in Wuyuan have been repeatedly surrounded and severely attacked by the Chinese. In southern Hebei, the Japanese troops who attacked Qingfeng were repulsed by the Chinese, suffering heavy casualties. On the surface of the Dongliu River in southern Anhui, a Japanese giant warship was sunk and three were heavily damaged this week, posing a major threat to Japanese water transportation. This is also an important achievement this week. (16th dispatch)</p>

<h3>"Political Conference Postponed"</h3>
<p>Beiping—According to sources close to the Beiping "Provisional Government," the "Central Political Conference" has been postponed again to the 26th of this month, instead of the 20th.

It is also heard that the "Joint Conference" of the puppet regimes in Nanjing and Beiping will be held on the 28th of this month. It is heard that after a few days of the "Central Political Conference," a declaration will be issued announcing the establishment of the "New Central Government." The Provisional Government is currently making preparations to celebrate the establishment of the "New Government." Wang Kemin and his followers' attitude towards the Nanjing conference is still uncertain, because Major General Xida, the liaison officer of the Asia Development Board in North China, strongly opposes the new regime's absorption of Beiping power. Now that Xida is about to leave China, it is uncertain whether his successor will vigorously support Wang Kemin as Xida did. (Reuters, 16th dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>US-Japan Economic Ties and National Relations</h3>
<p>Since Japan launched its war of aggression against China, all of its industries have been reorganized to meet wartime needs, focusing all its efforts on the manufacture of military supplies. However, Japan's domestic heavy industry base is fundamentally weak and immature. Most of the raw materials needed for military supplies are imported from abroad. Due to the neglect of production, the consumption of foreign exchange, public and private economies are showing significant fluctuations. At this time, it cannot afford to cut off foreign aid or lose the benefits of foreign trade. However, after the United States announced the cancellation of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation and its actual expiration, the huge benefits of trade with the United States, as well as the sources of goods for livelihood and aggression, are no longer guaranteed and are in a precarious position.</p>
<p>Although the United States is on the eastern shore of the Pacific Ocean, far from Japan, the two countries have always maintained the most convenient and direct sea transport trade, so the commercial relationship between the two countries is unusually close. In addition, the United States is naturally rich, its industry is developed, and its production of gold, silver, copper, iron, magnesium, coal, petroleum, etc. leads the world; its agricultural products such as cotton, wheat, and corn are also extremely abundant. Its international position originally had the view of surpassing everything; and with the outbreak of the European War, its superior situation is even more unparalleled by other countries in the world. Tracing back half a century, Japan's dependence on trade with the United States has been the greatest. Even in recent years, such as between 1934 and 1938, Japan's total exports to the United States were 260 million yen, and its total imports were approximately 450 million yen, so the import surplus reached 190 million yen, that is, the ratio of imports to exports was nine to five. During this period, the US surplus to Japan accounted for 27 percent of the total. This statistic can certainly indicate that Japan is a good customer of the United States; but in terms of the types of important trade goods, Japan's exports to the United States, except for raw silk, are not essential to the United States, such as canned food, pottery, and porcelain; on the contrary, the situation of Japan relying on imports from the United States is very different. According to recent statistics, Japan's total imports in 1936 were more than 2.7 billion (2,764,000,000) yen, of which direct military supplies accounted for 660 million yen, and its total imports in 1938 were more than 2.6 billion (2,663,000,000) yen, of which direct military supplies accounted for more than 1.2 billion (1,247,000,000) yen. Furthermore, according to the research results of the famous Japanese economist Seiichi Kojima, it is also confirmed that the United States occupies a particularly important position in Japan's overseas supply of defense industries. In terms of shipping, Japan has always been developed and has expanded greatly in recent years; it has routes west to Europe, east to the Americas, and south to the South Pacific Islands. Since 1921, the tonnage of Japanese ships passing through the Suez Canal has been approximately between 900,000 tons and 1 million tons per year, and there has been little change in recent years; while the total number of its ships passing through the Panama Canal has gradually increased from 340,000 tons in 1919, reaching a distance of 1.7 million tons by 1937. Compared to the two, the latter has made rapid progress and has indeed overtaken the former. Although Japanese ships passing through the Panama Canal may not necessarily be going to the United States, the scope of economic activity cannot be measured by the tonnage of ships; but from this, we can also see how seriously Japan's maritime transport depends on the United States. Originally, any trade between two countries must benefit both sides; but analyzing the benefits obtained, their nature is often different, and the relationship is very different. The influence and the final result are vastly different. In other words, although the trading methods are relatively opposite, the degree to which the two countries depend on each other is completely different. Taking the trade situation between Japan and the United States as an example, the degree to which the Japanese economic structure depends on the United States is much deeper than the degree to which the American economic structure depends on Japan. If the United States loses the Japanese market and the supply of Japanese goods, it will not be enough to shake the economic life of the United States. On the contrary, if Japan loses the American market and the supply of American goods, Japan will inevitably suffer a fatal blow economically. Simply put: Japan cannot lose the United States, while the United States may abandon Japan. Therefore, Japan's economic relationship with the United States needs to be actively adjusted from Japan's side.</p>
<p>The urgent need to adjust US-Japan relations is well known to the Japanese side; but the deterioration of US-Japan relations was initially not taken seriously by the Japanese side, and then they wanted to use lies and roars to reverse the trend of deterioration. The Japanese side does not seem to feel that the cause of the deterioration is the atrocities that began on September 18. Japan also believes that the United States' declaration to abolish the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation was sudden, unexpected, and that the United States was at fault in terms of reason. Japan does not seem to realize to this day that the fundamental reason for the deterioration of US-Japan relations lies in Japan's violent aggression against China and its attempt to dominate the Far East. It should be known that since the fundamental reason for the deterioration of US-Japan relations lies here, if Japan wants to improve its relations with the United States and restore its economic function, it must revise its policy of aggression against China and stop its violent actions against China.</p>
<p>Observing Japan's recent attitude towards the United States, it seems that they have become slightly aware, but not thoroughly aware. They know that relations with the United States cannot be further deteriorated, and that it is best to adjust relations with the United States; but they still want to use small political and diplomatic magic tricks to shift the United States' firm Far East policy, they still want to use false threats to deter the United States' planned steps to curb violence, they still want to create smoke in China to make the United States hesitate and confused, and they still want to accelerate exploitation in China, increase national power, so as to exclude the United States and subdue the United States. Japan not only thinks so, but is already doing it recklessly in various ways. Japan is not without intelligent people, but greed blinds them. It is hopeless for them to be thoroughly aware without a real and effective head-on blow. How can they not understand that the economic pressure from the United States can lead Japan to its death; they believe that the United States has accepted Japan's intimidation, so they dare not use economic pressure.</p>

<h3>Japanese Failure in Cotton Planting in North China</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to news from here today, the Japanese cotton planting plan promoted in North China last year has been completely disrupted by Chinese guerrillas in North China. According to the Japanese plan, it was originally intended to produce 4,600,000 dan of cotton in Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, Shandong, and other provinces in 1939. But in fact, the cotton production in North China last year was only a quarter of the Japanese budget, that is, 1,300,000 dan. There are two reasons why the Japanese plan failed so miserably: (1) the activities of the guerrillas; (2) the farmers are unwilling to plant anything other than essential food. This is the main reason for the Japanese failure. It is also reported that the Chinese government is also collecting a large amount of cotton material in the guerrilla areas and transporting it to the interior. Furthermore, Japan originally planned to increase the rice production in North China to US$100,000,000 before 1946, so that Japan's cotton could achieve self-sufficiency.

<h3>Tianjin Silver Deposit Issue: Britain and Japan Fail to Reach Compromise, Japanese Newspaper's Report on Usage Regulations Officially Denied by British Embassy in Tokyo</h3>

<h3>German Diplomacy Actively Seeks to Stabilize the Situation in Southeastern Europe, Exerts Utmost Effort to Reconcile Soviet-Italian Relations, and Is Willing to See Romania Obtain Security Guarantees</h3>
<p>Capital City of Switzerland: According to news from Berlin, Germany is simultaneously engaged in diplomatic activities on several fronts. Firstly, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's personal meeting with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is bound to have an effect in the short term. Secondly, relations between Germany and the Vatican are expected to be clarified. Thirdly, relations between Germany and the United States may soon normalize. Fourthly, now that the Soviet Union and Finland have restored peace, this is a good opportunity for the Nordic countries to promote relations. Germany intends to seize this opportunity to continue its activities. According to reliable information, the country seems to have fully expressed its support for the proposal of a defense alliance treaty between the three Nordic countries. Fifthly, Germany wants to make every effort to stabilize the situation in Southeastern Europe. Therefore, it will probably actively promote the proposal for the Soviet Union and Romania to sign a non-aggression treaty from the sidelines. In view of the above five points, the activity of German diplomacy can be seen. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam: The German Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Dr. Schulenburg, will return to Berlin in a few days. It is expected that after Schulenburg arrives in Berlin, Hitler's efforts to reconcile Stalin and Mussolini will be further intensified. Hitler wants to use the reconciliation of the Soviet Union and Italy as a way to advance the Nazi plan in Southeastern Europe. Neutral sources with access to information said that Hitler hopes that the Soviet Union will sign a mutual non-aggression treaty with Romania and Turkey in the short term. According to news from the Nazi Party, the Soviet-Romanian negotiations are progressing well, but the negotiations with Turkey are only in the preliminary stages. It is heard that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, while in Rome, told Italian Prime Minister Mussolini that both the Soviet Union and Germany are prepared to guarantee the integrity of Romania. However, the Italian Prime Minister demanded a more specific guarantee. The current Soviet-Romanian negotiations on a non-aggression treaty are probably the reply that Germany wants to give to Italy. From Hitler's point of view, a Soviet-Turkish non-aggression treaty is even more important because it can counter the Anglo-Franco-Turkish alliance. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>The Hague: According to news from Berlin, the Romanian Minister to the Soviet Union, Teano, is scheduled to visit Foreign People's Commissar Molotov this afternoon to study the possibility of establishing an agreement between the two countries.

<p>The Swiss capital city's "Ticino State Post" recently carried a dispatch from a Rome-based reporter stating that rumors of an impending rapprochement between Italy and the Soviet Union have recently been denied by Italian political figures. The newspaper also said that Italy's relations with Turkey are quite friendly, and they share the common goal of preventing the intrusion of Soviet forces into the Balkan Peninsula and the Mediterranean coast. Turkey's attitude towards the Soviet Union has not changed, on the contrary, its relations with Britain and France are extremely close. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that since Soviet-Finnish peace has been restored, the Scandinavian Peninsula is temporarily free from the danger of becoming a war zone. Therefore, general speculation is focused on the possibility of changes in the Near East. There are many rumors regarding Romania's position. German propagandists claim that they have achieved something in Romania. However, according to well-informed Romanian sources in London, the news that Soviet and Romanian officials are conducting negotiations has not been confirmed. The German radio broadcast, which claimed that the Soviet-Romanian negotiations would completely change the international situation before the end of this week, is not worthy of attention. The Romanian side in London does not expect any surprising developments and believes that all the claims made by Germany are intended for internal consumption. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union and Italy Begin Commercial Negotiations, Germany Strongly Supports Them in Order to Promote Political Understanding</h3>
<p>London: Soviet sources here recently confirmed that the Soviet Union and Italy have already begun commercial negotiations. Germany deeply hopes that the Soviet Union and Italy can move closer to each other, first establish a commercial agreement, so as to promote political understanding, just as Germany and the Soviet Union did in August of last year. Therefore, it will certainly support the Soviet-Italian commercial negotiations from the sidelines. At present, the Soviet Union and Italy have one thing in common, that is, they both hope that the current European war will end early without a clear winner, so as to prevent the wishes of the Soviet Union and Italy from being hindered and unrealized by the victor. This point is also recognized by Italian figures. In short, British political figures are paying close attention to the general situation, especially to the Soviet Union's plan to conduct commercial negotiations with Romania. After the Finnish-Soviet peace, the Soviet Union can use the new situation to expand its influence into the Balkan Peninsula. For this reason, Romania will be subjected to joint pressure from Germany and the Soviet Union. However, it is not yet known whether Italy will participate. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>Berlin: German sources declared yesterday that Germany has rapidly consolidated its position in Eastern and Western Europe and indicated that Germany will take "surprising actions" against the Allied forces within ten days. Nazi sources further claimed that Germany is silent for now, but if it moves, it will definitely take action on the Western Front. Currently, it is focusing on Moscow, Rome, and the Romanian capital. However, officials in Berlin and Moscow have denied any formal guarantee to Romania. Authoritative sources said, "It is unreasonable to say that Germany favors the Danish-Norwegian alliance proposed by Finland." Some believe that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, since visiting Moscow last September, has discussed the complex issue of Balkan security and also told Prime Minister Mussolini during his recent trip to Rome that Germany and the Soviet Union both want peace and tranquility in Southeastern Europe. It is said that Prime Minister Mussolini does not easily trust the Soviet Union's goals in the Balkans. However, the German side believes that Mussolini has accepted Ribbentrop's guarantee in order to improve relations with Moscow and cites rumors of Soviet-Italian commercial talks and diplomatic rapprochement as evidence. In short, it is still questionable whether Ribbentrop has obtained Moscow's consent. (United Press dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>Romanian Iron Guard Voluntarily Reverts to Allegiance, Vows Loyalty to the Country, External Aggression Promotes Unity</h3>
<p>Rome: It was announced here last night that King Carol of Romania and the Iron Guard, Romania's fascist organization, have reached a reconciliation. The King has granted freedom to all who pledge to abide by the National Renaissance Front. It has been determined that the National Renaissance Front is the only political organization allowed in Romania. Yesterday, the leader of the Iron Guard declared on behalf of the Dateri Kogo that the group accepted the Roman King's conditions. Rumor has it that the terms laid out by the Iron Guard for joining the National Renaissance Front include the release of 800 Iron Guard members, who are currently being held in shelters. Some of those detained have since been released, and leaders currently residing in Germany have been allowed to return to the country. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>Romanian Capital: Eight hundred members of the Iron Guard who had been imprisoned for months were released today. It is said that this was the result of Iron Guard members writing to the Romanian King to express their loyalty and not due to pressure from Germany. However, Professor Inisgu, the leader of the Iron Guard, passed away today due to heart disease. This point is a significant blow to the Iron Guard. (United Press dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>German Economic Delegation to Visit Romanian Capital, Led by Schacht</h3>
<p>Capital City of Switzerland: It has been learned that a German economic delegation, led by Dr. Schacht, the former president of the German Central Bank, and Clodius, the director of the Commercial Treaty Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is scheduled to go to the Romanian capital in the short term. However, Walda, an economic expert who previously participated in the German-Romanian economic talks, will not accompany them. The main task of the delegation is to redefine the exchange rate between the Mark and the Romanian Leu and to find ways to increase the amount of oil, soybeans, wool, and hides that Germany purchases from Romania, and Germany will provide agricultural technicians and various agricultural tools and seeds to develop Romania's agriculture.

<h3>Laval to Visit Rome to Adjust Franco-Italian Relations</h3>
<p>Geneva: It was learned from reliable sources that former French Prime Minister Laval criticized the government in the Senate yesterday in a speech on Franco-Italian relations, accusing it of failing to fully consider Italy's position and failing to meet Italy's demands, making it adopt a more friendly attitude towards Britain and France. Regarding this matter, it was learned from well-informed sources that Laval may travel to Rome again on a "private trip" in the near future to investigate the content of Italy's demands today.

<h3>Welles Revisits Rome to Meet with Italian King to Discuss Peace, and to Meet with Italian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Rome: After US Undersecretary of State Welles arrived here last night, he met with the Italian King today, leaving after a quarter of an hour. Later, he held talks with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano for an hour. According to an official statement, the meeting lasted a long time and was very harmonious. German Ambassador McGansen was also present, but it was soon learned that McGansen's visit to the Italian Foreign Ministry had nothing to do with this matter. Welles will meet with the Pope on Sunday. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>London: Welles sent a telegram to Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax today, thanking them for their hospitality in London and asking the Foreign Secretary to convey his regards to the King and Queen of England. The Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary have replied, expressing their satisfaction and inspiration for Welles's decision to visit England and the opportunity to meet with each other. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>Rome: After US Undersecretary of State Welles arrived here last night, the European situation seems to have entered another stage. There may be a possibility of peace between Germany and the Allied forces. Well-informed circles here recently said that Welles's meeting with the Italian King at 9:00 this morning, which was not originally on Welles's schedule, was not without reason. Some believe that the content of Welles's talks with the Italian King was about a peace plan, which is said to have been proposed to the Pope by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop at the Vatican this week. Welles may meet with the Pope on Sunday and visited Italian Foreign Minister Ciano at 10:00 this morning. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will speak with Welles at 5:00 this afternoon, at which time Mussolini will claim that the prolongation of the European war will be enough to promote a large Eastern European group, including the Soviet Union, Germany, the Balkans, and the seaboard countries of Poland. Italy will also join. According to reports from the Vatican, under German pressure, the Soviet Union has made a guarantee to Romania that the issue of Bessarabia will be shelved during the European war. (United Press dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>Rome: The visit of US Undersecretary of State Welles again has recently been commented on by political figures here, saying that the events that have occurred in Europe in recent days, especially the signing of the peace treaty between the Soviet Union and Finland, have created a new situation. Whether Welles's mission will be successful depends on the outcome of his talks with Foreign Minister Ciano, Prime Minister Mussolini, and the Pope. In short, Welles has a thorough understanding of the attitudes of the belligerent countries on the issue of peace and war, and he can judge the value of any peace initiative in the future.

<h3>French Senate Trusts the Government, Calls for Cabinet Reshuffle</h3>
<p>Paris: The Senate held secret meetings twice yesterday and today, and discussed in detail general issues of combat and the policies pursued by France on the issue of Finland. Former Foreign Minister Peng Gu, former Prime Minister Laval, and many other important senators successively raised inquiries, which were answered one by one by Prime Minister Daladier. The Senate finally unanimously passed a vote of confidence in the government, the content of which roughly stated that we are deeply impressed by the heroic resistance of the Finnish people, and the future of the country is very bright. It also stated that the Senate trusts that the French government will be able to make efforts to engage in war and achieve complete victory, so that all nations can restore freedom. Many members of the House of Representatives recently believed that the government should take advantage of the Senate's unanimous support to decide to reshuffle the cabinet and add two departments for information and propaganda. Although opinions on the cabinet reshuffle are quite divided among political figures, it is unanimously believed that the current policy will not change under any circumstances. In other words, France is determined to fight to the end until the final victory. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>Paris: The Paris edition of the New York Tribune recently stated that French political figures believe that Prime Minister Daladier will reshuffle the cabinet in the short term and form a wartime cabinet conference composed of important members to make various decisions quickly. In addition, Prime Minister Daladier is too burdened with his responsibilities as Minister of Defense and Foreign Affairs. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>Paris: Whether the Soviet-Finnish peace has any repercussions on the position of the French government is still a matter of concern in political circles. Some parties demanded that Britain and France should explore concrete policies for war, and to strike quickly as required, and advocated the establishment of a five or six-person war cabinet, in the spirit of the former Clemenceau to carry out the war, and to reduce Daladier's burden of serving as Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and Army Minister. Right-wing politicians and newspapers still demanded the severance of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union is Germany's ally. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>British Colonial Secretary Visits Paris</h3>
<p>Paris: British Colonial Secretary MacDonald arrived here today and will discuss economic and colonial issues with French Colonial Minister Mandel in the next few days. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>Franco Plans to Form Anti-Soviet Group, Proposes to Italian Premier</h3>
<p>London - According to authoritative sources here, Spanish dictator General Franco is suggesting to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini that they organize a European anti-Communist bloc, with the aim of resisting Soviet encroachment in Europe. The proposal includes a provision for the use of force when necessary and encompasses a plan to enlist moral support from Latin American countries for anti-Communist efforts. Franco's special envoy is exerting considerable diplomatic pressure in Rome to establish the anti-Communist bloc. However, the Italian Prime Minister's decision remains unknown. Italy has made it clear that it will resist any Soviet invasion of the Balkan countries with force. Franco's plan reportedly aims to form a strong Italian-Spanish-British-French bloc to counter the Soviet Union. It is also said that Spanish official and public opinion has become extremely anti-German due to the German-Soviet pact, and the German secret police's confirmed atrocities against Polish Catholic priests have especially aroused public sentiment throughout Spain. Therefore, according to neutral diplomatic circles, Hitler's pact with the Soviet Union not only damaged the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo axis but also lost a potentially powerful ally, as he had attempted to have Spain attack the rear of France. Furthermore, according to diplomatic circles in Latin American countries stationed in London, in recent weeks, high-ranking Spanish civil and military officials have virtually severed relations with the German ambassador to Spain.

<h3>Finnish Parliament Approves Peace Treaty with the Soviet Union, Prime Minister Explains Reasons for Choosing Peace Over War, Will Devote Efforts to Reconstruction with Sword in One Hand and Plow in the Other</h3>
<p>Helsinki - The Finnish Parliament last night approved the peace treaty with the Soviet Union by a vote of 145 to 3, ceding one-tenth of its land to the Soviet Union and formally ending the Soviet-Finnish war. More than fifty members of parliament were absent or abstained from voting last night. The parliament convened secretly "somewhere in Finland." It is reported that Prime Minister Ryti, surrounded by the cabinet, strongly defended the peace treaty. According to well-informed sources, the treaty's passage was slightly opposed. (United Press, 16th)</p>
<p>Helsinki - The Finnish Parliament, after debating for two and a half hours last night, approved the peace treaty with the Soviet Union by a vote of 143 to 3. The Foreign Affairs Committee stated that under the current circumstances, it considered it necessary to advocate for accepting the treaty. Prime Minister Ryti stated that Finland and the entire Western civilization are still in great danger. No one can say what will happen tomorrow. We believe that choosing peace over war is the best option at present. We did not request Allied troops because this move would involve Finland in a major war, and the war zone would shift from the Western Front to the Scandinavian Peninsula. Furthermore, Sweden and Norway refused transit, making the arrival of reinforcements uncertain, and the Anglo-French willingness to send troops was too late. We must now work quickly on reconstruction, healing wounds, and maintaining our spiritual and material civilization, as well as the development of our society based on justice, with a sword in one hand and a plow in the other. Finnish President Kallio delivered a brief speech, recounting the past events leading to the war, requesting Parliament to approve the treaty, and stating that the Finnish government had repeatedly expressed its desire to restore peace since the beginning of the war.

<h3>Soviet Troops Enter Viipuri, a Ghost Town, Residents of Finnish Conceded Areas Relocate Westward, Supporting the Old and Carrying the Young</h3>
<p>Helsinki - As Soviet troops entered the devastated city of Viipuri last night, 400,000 Finns began their large-scale migration. Those abandoning their homes accounted for one-sixth of the entire Finnish population. Young women carrying infants, village women carrying furniture, traveled by truck or sleigh, along with a continuous stream of streetcars, trucks, and bicycles, all crowded on the road, heading west. Residents were not forced to leave, but only about one percent volunteered to remain in the ceded areas. The government mobilized all vehicles to assist in the relocation, requisitioning all vehicles within fifteen miles of the new border to transport departing people. All cars and railways in the country were mobilized. After the Soviet troops entered Viipuri, they found only a ghost town. For three days, residents had been continuously moving goods and equipment out of the city. Even large stores were empty. In the area west of Lake Ladoga, no less than 50,000 heads of cattle, sheep, pigs, and birds are being transported. Residents of the Hanko Peninsula are now leaving en masse. Freight cars loaded with goods stretched for miles, heading inland to various locations. The relocation is quite orderly. People from the same village gather together, walking in groups. Finnish soldiers are extremely exhausted, many unable to travel the five miles a day as stipulated in the peace treaty. An officer saw that hundreds of Finnish soldiers resting on the road had all frozen to death. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Stockholm - Since Finland appealed for assistance in transporting residents evacuating from ceded areas, thousands of Swedish cars, buses, and trucks have headed north to provide aid. At the same time, Sweden has begun to improve its domestic defenses. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Helsinki - The land ceded by Finland due to the Soviet-Finnish treaty has not yet been determined. The Karelian Isthmus ceded approximately 6,250,000 acres, with a population of approximately 410,000 to 440,000, including 84,000 in the cities of Viipuri, Käkisalmi, and Sortavala. Finland also lost the Hanko Peninsula, areas along the Arctic Ocean, and areas in the east. However, most of the residents of the ceded areas will relocate within the new borders, and the total Finnish population will not decrease significantly. (Haitong News Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>Helsinki - The first batch of Finnish regular troops withdrew from the Karelian front to this area yesterday. According to Finnish military sources, the Finnish troops on the northern front will withdraw on April 10, the last day stipulated, due to traffic congestion and transportation difficulties in that area. (Haitong News Agency, 16th)</p>
<h3>Finnish Army Will Not Demobilize for the Time Being</h3>
<p>Stockholm - Finland has no intention of immediately demobilizing its army. Conscripted 18-year-olds are still reporting for duty, apparently planning to begin building new defense lines immediately after the troop withdrawal stipulated in the treaty is completed. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>War Costs Amount to 4.5 Billion</h3>
<p>Helsinki - According to Finnish government estimates, the Soviet-Finnish war lasted three and a half months, and Finland consumed approximately 4,500,000,000 Finnish marks, including mobilization costs and the costs of keeping the troops prepared before the outbreak of the war. However, the losses from air raids are not included. It is generally believed that Finland's reconstruction will require many years of effort, and with the loss of vast territories, national income has decreased, making construction funding difficult. The Finnish government is seeking foreign loans. (Haitong News Agency, 16th)</p>
<h3>Defense Alliance Among Finland, Sweden, and Norway is Being Actively Planned, Unifying Artillery Calibers</h3>
<p>Stockholm - According to news from here today, a defense alliance among Sweden, Norway, and Finland is still being actively planned. It is also reported that Sweden, Norway, and Finland are planning to unify the calibers of artillery in the three countries, so that the military equipment of the three countries can be mutually compatible in the event of an emergency, thereby enhancing their defense capabilities. It is reported that Norway and Sweden have decided to expand their military preparations. (United Press, 16th)</p>
<p>Berlin - A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry declared to foreign visitors that Germany's attitude toward Sweden and Norway has not changed after the establishment of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty. Germany has maintained strict neutrality regarding the Soviet-Finnish war, just like Sweden and Norway, and opposes any chaotic state in any part of Europe. Therefore, Germany is deeply satisfied after the restoration of normal relations in Northern Europe and will continue to maintain relations with Northern Europe in accordance with its economic interests.

<h3>Italian Corporate Council Passes Air Force Budget, Secretary of Aviation Says Air Force is the Decisive Factor in Future Wars</h3>
<p>Rome - Italian Undersecretary of Aviation and Air Force Chief of Staff General Pricolo announced the plan to expand the air force to the Fascist Corporate Council yesterday. The Council immediately unanimously passed the Aviation Ministry's provisional budget for 1940, totaling 3,261,000,000 lire. Eighteen years ago, the Italian Air Force's budget was only 122,000,000 lire. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini was also present when the budget was passed. General Pricolo reported on the development of the Italian Air Force, stating that the massive Italian Air Force is on standby, ready to fight and demonstrate its efficiency. We should remember that Italy's position is most vulnerable to air attacks, and we must strive for the improvement of the Air Force. The Air Force should adopt various technological inventions and build expensive aircraft, but an effective Air Force is absolutely necessary. Without an Air Force, there can be no victory, and the results of the Air Force depend on the combat aircraft being able to build the greatest combat achievements. Air Force operations must maintain contact with the army and navy, and its organization should not remain fixed but should be adapted to the needs of the time. In the current European war, the army has made no progress, naval battles are limited to attacks on merchant ships, and the Air Force also only has guerrilla warfare. There have been no large-scale air raids on military targets or cities. However, when the real war begins, the Air Force will undoubtedly occupy a decisive position. The German Air Force's attack on the Polish army and air force during the Polish war, which caused Poland to lose its will to fight, was the decisive factor in Poland's rapid collapse. Recently, the German Air Force has bombed many British merchant ships in the North Sea, with minimal losses to the Air Force. And the activities of naval fleets can only be restricted by the Air Force. The Mediterranean is Italy's lifeline, and the Italian Air Force will be able to actively attack the navy. The equipment of the Italian Air Force is neat, and the morale of the pilots is extremely high. When the Air Force is needed, it will not disappoint the people. Italy does not worry about the lack of pilots and aircraft, and the Italian Air Force's burning, resolute, and confident spirit is unprecedented. After General Pricolo finished his speech, the air force officers and soldiers in the audience cheered and paid tribute to Mussolini. (Haitong News Agency, 16th)</p>
<h3>British and French Forces in the Far East Intensify Cooperation</h3>
<p>Amsterdam - According to a report in the "Times" from Singapore, the troops of the Allied Far Eastern colonies will intensify cooperation.

<h3>British and French Military Preparations in the Near East</h3>
<p>Istanbul - According to news received here from Ankara, Turkey, French Air Defense Commander-in-Chief General Moron will visit Turkey within days, with the aim of helping Turkey establish air defense fortifications. The British and French Air Force Commanders in the Near East recently held a meeting here, and now France has sent the Air Defense Commander-in-Chief to visit, which shows that Britain and France are still actively making various arrangements for the Near East.

<h3>Saito's Expulsion Causes Significant Domestic Repercussions, Japanese Army Holds Meeting to Devise So-Called Ways to Harmonize Military and Civilians</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Although Saito, who criticized the Konoe Declaration, has been expelled, this matter has not ended. The next act may have a greater impact on domestic politics than the Saito expulsion storm. When the cabinet and the military decided to punish Saito, they completely disregarded the right to freedom of speech in parliament granted by the constitution. Some members of the House of Representatives strongly opposed it, because before the House of Representatives obtained a two-thirds majority to pass Saito's expulsion, the political parties had already shown internal divisions and dissent. It seems that the general public approves of Saito's request for the government to thoroughly explain its China policy, so Saito's punishment not only greatly damages the credibility of political parties but will also cause repercussions in the future. The army now intends to take action on this, to inform the people of the true purpose of the "holy war" and promote harmony between the army and the people. Therefore, it has convened a meeting of garrison commanders from all over Japan in Tokyo. The Inspector General of Military Affairs detailed the points where Saito's remarks conflicted with the purpose of the "holy war" against China. Then, the commanders reported on the impact of Saito's remarks in the local areas. Finally, they discussed specific ways to enhance military-civilian harmony. It was ultimately decided that the military authorities should explain to local administrative officials and schools the unchangeable policy of the army and elaborate on the basic principles of the "holy war" against China. At the same time, the 국민신문 (Kokumin Shinbun) reported that some cabinet members seemed to support Saito's remarks. It is rumored that Koyamaya Kazuo, a Diet official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Oyama Kunitaro, a councilor of the Ministry of the Navy, have adopted an inappropriate attitude towards the explanation of the war policy. If this is the case, a situation of dispute may arise. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>Indian National Congress Holds Annual Meeting, Gandhi Publishes an Article, Struggle is Not Anti-British</h3>
<p>Madras - The Indian National Congress is scheduled to hold its annual meeting in Ramgarh today. Former Chairman Acharya wrote a letter to the Congress, stating that the British did not come here as conquerors, but at the invitation of the people, and with the continued assistance of the people. We should remember the siege of Arcot, where Indians sacrificed their blood to help the British. The right of empire does not exist. The British side has recently shown an increasing willingness to treat India as part of the British Commonwealth of Nations based on equal treatment. If India completely breaks away from Britain, the result will be a lose-lose situation, which will be particularly unfavorable to India. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Bombay - In response to a reporter's inquiry about his belief in the sincerity of the Viceroy, Gandhi specially published an article in his mouthpiece "Harijan" today, saying that as far as he is concerned, he hopes to have several more meetings with the Viceroy. India's struggle is not anti-British. Its goal is to oppose exploitation and foreign rule, but not to oppose foreigners. Gandhi mentioned the possible invasion from the north. The elected male and female members of parliament, who have this kind of panic, will not petition the British to withdraw their troops, which is tantamount to signing their own death warrant. As for the issue of India's status, it is not the Congress Party but himself who has changed his mind. A more mature reflection has made him realize that the status of a dominion is not suitable for India. Gandhi did not say that Britain must recognize India's right to self-determination, and what it decides may even be a dominion, or slightly less than independence, or disguised independence, or complete independence, and could not predict.

<h3>Death of German Steel Tycoon Völler, Chairman Chiang Sent Condolences</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Berlin dispatches, German steel magnate Hua Fuller passed away in Germany on January 22 of this year. Hua started a small-scale steel business with his own funds in Germany in 1904, at the age of only 23. Before the European War from 1914 to 1918, he had great development in domestic and foreign markets. After 1918, he established several export branches in European countries and overseas. Hua was the first to conduct large-scale business with China and the Soviet Union, and Hua Fuller's production capacity also became increasingly stable. Hua was a co-founder of the United Steel Works, but later left the relationship and operated independently. Its business scope includes general steel business, iron ore mining, steel and metal industries, and its broader scope includes the production of tinplate steel and machinery industries, and is popular all over the world. The German government considered Hua Fuller to have made remarkable achievements in industrial management, and until recently, he was still employed as a special member of the National Defense Economy. After Hua's death, many important government officials and military leaders went to participate in the memorial service, which shows the importance of Hua's position during his lifetime, and the condolence messages from Chairman Chiang and ministers of various ministries are especially noted by all sectors here.

<h3>British and Italian Trade Negotiations to Reopen, British Experts to Go to Rome to Study Coal and Other Issues</h3>
<p>London - It is learned that British and Italian trade negotiations have not yet been formally reopened. The British government intends to send an expert to Rome on the 17th of this month to study the issue of debt repayment and coal. At present, informal talks are underway between the two sides in London, and an understanding is expected. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>London - The "Daily Telegraph" recently reported that, according to reliable sources, the British and Italian countries will soon reopen trade negotiations in order to sign a trade agreement and restore trade between the two countries to the amount in 1928, that is, 38,000,000 pounds per year. It is reported that Italy will sell heavy industrial manufactured goods to the United Kingdom in exchange for certain raw materials. As for the coal issue, Italy needs to purchase 12 million tons from foreign countries every year and cannot completely import it from Germany by rail. Therefore, it has ordered 5.5 million tons from the United Kingdom. This is considered by the United Kingdom to be able to double. In short, if the United Kingdom can know for sure that various Italian industries are not providing assistance to Germany, it is willing to continuously supply Italy with coal. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<h3>Chamberlain's 71st Birthday, Approaching Three Years as Prime Minister</h3>
<p>London - The 18th of this month is Prime Minister Chamberlain's 71st birthday, and May 28 of this year will be the third anniversary of the Prime Minister's assumption of office.

<h3>British Ambassador to the United States Issues Statement, Restrictions on Imports of American Goods Are Only Wartime Measures</h3>
<p>Washington - British Ambassador to the United States Lord Lothian issued a formal statement yesterday, stating that British restrictions on the import of certain American products are only wartime measures and there is no intention to promote a permanent change in trade. Secretary of State Hull then told reporters that negotiations between the United States and representatives of the British and French governments to safeguard American commercial interests are continuing. Since the outbreak of the war, although US exports to Britain have been restricted, they have still increased greatly, and exports to France have more than doubled. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>Registered British Youth Will All Enlist</h3>

The first batch will enlist in service this month, and the second batch will also be called up for enlistment next month. It is generally said that the authorities registered two batches of young people in less than a month in order to calmly examine their physiques before these people enlisted, so as to separately determine the appropriate work that can be assigned.

<h3>US Envoys to South American Countries to Meet in Brazil Next Month, Four Countries Agree to Sign Convention on Establishing Pan-American Central Bank</h3>
<p>Washington - The US Department of State announced that the US ambassadors to Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay will meet in the capital of Brazil from April 20 to 26. US Ambassador to Brazil Caffery will be the chairman. Similar meetings were held in the capitals of Panama and Peru in 1930 and 1939, with the aim of enhancing cooperation between US envoys to South American countries and US Department of State officials. The Department of State will be led by Briggs, Director of the American Affairs Bureau, accompanied by several other representatives, who will go to the capital of Brazil at that time to exchange opinions with the ambassadors attending the meeting. (Haitong News Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>Washington - The Pan-American Economic Committee recently announced that the United States, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico have all agreed to sign a convention to establish the Pan-American Bank (capital of US$100 million) to lend funds to Latin American countries for purchasing goods from the United States. Honduras and Venezuela have expressed opposition to this, while Cuba, Ecuador, Guatemala, and El Salvador are still considering it and will submit their replies before April 1. It can be established as long as one country expresses its approval, because according to the original plan, it must be implemented with the approval of five countries. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<h3>Japan and Argentina Promote Trade, Exchange Goods in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>Washington - The US Department of State announced yesterday that the Japanese ambassador to Argentina and the Argentine Foreign Minister recently exchanged documents on increasing Japanese-Argentine trade. Although these documents cannot actually be regarded as a trade agreement, both parties stipulated that Japan would purchase large quantities of wool, meat, and cotton from Argentina, and Argentina would purchase several kinds of Japanese products from Japan. The purchase value of both parties is 40 million Japanese yen. (United Press, 16th)</p>
<p>Washington - Trade experts said today that the trade agreement established between Japan and Argentina is a psychological move by Japan, and its effect is intended to offset the blow of the abolition of the US-Japan trade agreement. Japan's purchase of Argentine cotton is intended to attack American cotton, but it is not asked whether Argentine cotton can replace American cotton when transported to Japan.

<h3>Czech News Agency Reports: Germans Arrest More Czechs</h3>
<p>Paris – The Czech News Agency announced today that German authorities have recently been carrying out large-scale arrests of innocent people in the "Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia." Among those arrested are many Czech reserve officers, members of the Sokol sports association, and Catholics. In Moravia province alone, 25 priests have been arrested since last month. The German political police have recently been searching for secret wireless radio stations in various locations. As a result, residents who possess materials for manufacturing wireless transmitters or even those who own radio receivers are often arrested. In addition, although the German authorities have implemented strict security measures along the borders of the "Protectorate," many Czech students are still attempting to cross the border and escape into France to join the Czech army. For example, on the 13th of last month, in a location bordering Slovakia in Moravia province, several Czech students exchanged gunfire with German garrison troops. Each side suffered one injury, and the remaining students escaped across the border. (Havas, 15th)</p>

<h3>British Consul in Tianjin Explains Butler's Remarks</h3>
<p>Tianjin – The British Consul-General in Tianjin, White, issued a formal notice to the press today, stating that the telegrams regarding Butler's remarks in the House of Commons have caused misunderstandings in the city due to brevity. He can confirm that Butler's reference to negotiations meant negotiations regarding obstacles, difficulties, and restrictions encountered by British interests. As for the rumor that Japanese troops are collecting a fixed amount of tax from all Chinese entering the British Concession, he personally believes this rumor is entirely unfounded and that there is no evidence of Japanese officers extorting or accepting bribes. This matter was recently raised in the House of Commons by British Conservative MP Hanner, who asked Foreign Secretary Butler if he was aware that Japanese officers were collecting a fixed tax from Chinese entering the British Concession in Tianjin.

<h3>Value of Chinese Exports Increases</h3>
<p>Chongqing – According to statistics released today, Chinese goods exported through Hong Kong in January of this year were valued at over HK$26 million, an increase of HK$11 million compared to the same period last year.

<h3>Zhu Jiahua Discusses the European War - No Disadvantage to China (Continued) - China's Diplomacy is Adept and Bears an Important Mission for World Peace</h3>
<p>The transportation situation between the Soviet Union and Germany is also worthy of our attention. Maritime transport in the Baltic Sea is easily threatened by the British and French navies, and in winter it cannot be fully used due to ice. Sea routes on the Black Sea and the Danube River must pass through other countries, and it is difficult to guarantee that they will not be cut off. The most reliable and convenient route is the railway across Poland. However, here we must consider the Soviet Union's transportation efficiency. Although its railways have increased from 73,000 kilometers to 85,000 kilometers, and the number of vehicles has increased from 475,000 to 645,000, with a carrying capacity increasing from 8.7 million tons to 15.7 million tons, according to experts' estimates, the Soviet Union can at most spare only one-tenth of its transportation capacity for exports to Germany. Assuming each wagon is used once a month, the transportation capacity freed up is still not enough to carry the iron sand normally needed by Germany.</p>
<p>With the above reasons, tangible or intangible, limiting economic exchanges between Germany and the Soviet Union, even if the two countries cooperate more closely, it will be truly difficult for the Soviet Union to support Germany's war effort single-handedly with economic aid.</p>
<h3>Fifth Discourse on "Tit for Tat"</h3>
<p>Hitler is very clear that he knows Germany's economic weakness is the biggest weakness in war. Therefore, he adopted a "tit for tat" strategy to determine his war strategy. He knows that the materials needed by Britain during wartime are overseas (such as 47 percent of Britain's food imports, which must come from Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and other places). Since the British and French navies have tightly blockaded Germany, Germany has also used its submarines and magnetic mines to implement a counter-blockade against Britain. In order to achieve thorough results, it has also adopted a strategy of maritime guerrilla warfare, and even pocket battleships have been released to operate everywhere. According to statistics from the past four months, British ships have already lost more than one million tons. This number is certainly large enough, but the United Kingdom has a total of 21 million tons of commercial ships and is constantly manufacturing and replenishing them. It is impossible for Germany to defeat Britain's maritime power by relying on maritime guerrilla warfare. We know that in land warfare, if guerrillas do not cooperate with the regular army, there is no way to determine the outcome of the war. The same is true in naval warfare. The same is true for air warfare. If the air force does not cooperate with the army or navy, then even the air force that Hitler's Göring is most proud of will find it difficult to operate independently or decide the war. Moreover, in terms of the training and replenishment of air force personnel, Germany is also inferior to Britain and France. General statistics say that a healthy nation can only select one air force talent out of every thousand people. Assuming that each aircraft requires four people, then in the current European powers, no country can cultivate more than 20,000 aircraft, because aircraft can only be manufactured competitively, while the number of pilots and combat personnel is ultimately limited. Britain and France, including their colonies, have a total population of 625.3 million, which is at least more convenient for replenishing air force personnel than Germany. Therefore, the current German air force has a slight advantage compared to the air forces of Britain and France, but in the near future, Britain and France, relying on manpower, material resources, and financial resources to expand their air forces, will have a tendency to surpass Germany. At that time, Germany, considering the difficulty of replenishing personnel, may not be able to send its air force to the airspace of Britain and France to gamble everything. As for Germany's industrial areas, 60 percent are only 150 miles from the front line, making them vulnerable to attacks by enemy air forces, while Britain's industrial areas are more than 300 miles from the front line, which is much safer.</p>
<p>Maritime guerrilla warfare is certainly a good strategy, and the air force's maximum attack can also have a huge effect, but the major battle or decisive battle can only rely on land warfare. So far, both belligerent countries have tried their best to avoid direct contact, concentrating all their efforts on a war of attrition, seeking to exhaust the enemy's combat power to a considerable extent before seeking to determine the outcome. So when will the European war begin? That is, when will the belligerent countries begin to attack the Maginot Line or the Siegfried Line?</p>
<p>Although it is not entirely impossible to break through these two lines of defense, the sacrifices will be unimaginable. This is also the reason why both belligerent countries are unwilling to try easily. The lessons learned from the last war are that trench warfare is the most boring. If the trench warfare happens this time, it will take ten or a hundred times more time and effort than before, and the prolongation of the war is an expected event. The longer the war drags on, the more disadvantageous it will be for Germany.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been various rumors in military affairs. It is said that Germany will attack by way of the Netherlands and Belgium, or that it will try to drag Italy into the water in order to have a major battle in the Po Valley. Whether it is credible is a matter of doubt. Let us assume one thing. It is not achievable in the short term. On the German side, because it is subject to various objective conditions, it is beneficial to end the war as soon as possible, and therefore the demand for a main battle is more urgent than that of Britain and France. It is gradually adopting a destructive attrition strategy, which is slightly different from the strategy of Britain and France. Our country should not ignore it. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Rice Shortage in Suzhou - Supply Does Not Meet Demand During the Transition Period</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence - Rice in the four rural areas of Suzhou City is currently in a transition period. Even if there is some storage, farmers must use it for self-sufficiency. In addition, the Japanese are widely collecting grain and sending it out of the country, so there is an extreme shortage of grain. The city once allocated 10,000 yuan from accumulated grain funds in the name of charity, intending to purchase and store grain from grain merchants. However, local farmers are having difficulty purchasing grain due to the difficulty of husking rice and selling it. Moreover, their stocks are insufficient and it is difficult to supply. Even purchasing from Wuxi is difficult because of the lack of indica rice and the difficulty of transporting it out without special permission, resulting in a situation where it is difficult to buy grain even with money.</p>
<h3>Status of Christian Schools in North China - Schools Not Interfered With by Any External Forces</h3>
<p>(Beiping Correspondence) Christian schools in North China, "in the Beiping area," Yenching University still maintains its independent and detached position, with 970 students, and is extremely developed. Middle schools such as Chongde and Luzhi were closed due to the anti-British movement. Sanji Elementary and Middle School was also closed and reorganized. Caizheng Commercial College, established by the YMCA, maintains its original level and no longer recruits new students. Other middle schools continue to operate as usual. Elementary schools, except for Shude and Mingxian, which were temporarily closed due to the anti-British movement, continue to operate as usual. The number of students in each school has increased to the point where there is no room to accommodate them. In terms of economy, they have all recovered to the situation before the incident. Currently, due to high prices and increased living standards, teachers and staff are finding it difficult to make ends meet, but Yenching has implemented a 40% subsidy to maintain the livelihood of its employees. "Schools in the Tianjin area" moved to the Chinese Concession for classes due to the flood, and then returned to their original location in mid-October. Most of the students have returned to school, except for a few who have transferred. "Various places in Jidong," such as Changli, Australia, Tangshan (Fengao Middle School, established by the British Methodist Church, is still operating with 700 students), and Zunhua have seen a sharp increase in the number of students, and are maintaining their normal operations. "Shanxi schools," except for a few that have moved, have mostly changed the form of the school and opened bible schools. "Southern Hebei" and "Northern Shandong" to "Jinan" and its "western schools" are still open, but mostly offer Scripture courses and are no longer called formal schools. "Qilu University" has a specialized course in Jinan, with a fairly practical curriculum. In Pingjin and other places, church schools have not been forced to participate in any parades or celebrations, but Xinmin Youth Corps, junior high school boys and girls, must take an oath to join. The first article of the oath is "Respect God and Buddha and do our best for the country." In church schools, it is requested to change it to "Do our best for the freedom of religion and for the country." There are no changes in the curriculum, and textbooks for primary and secondary schools, except for universities, are all local textbooks, reducing the number of English hours, but keeping the original hours for middle schools as it is not necessary to learn, and it has not been interfered with. Elementary schools add two hours of Japanese, but local Chinese can be hired as teachers. In short, each school can study quietly, without any external interference.</p>

<h3>Finnish Government States - Unable to Prepare for World Games</h3>
<p>(Helsinki, 15th, Haitong News Agency) After Finland and the Soviet Union concluded a peace treaty, the World Games Committee expressed its hope that this summer's World Games could still be held in Helsinki. However, today a spokesman for the Finnish government said that the energy of the people of the whole country must be concentrated on reconstruction work. Considering the time and money involved, Finland cannot undertake the preparation of the World Games.</p>
<p>(Helsinki, 15th, Havas) The 1940 Olympic Games, which had been decided to be held in the Finnish capital after Japan abandoned it, were virtually shelved due to the outbreak of the Finnish-Soviet War. It is now learned that a decision on this matter can be obtained within a few months. According to senior officials of the organizing committee, the preparations are largely in place. Unless there are special circumstances, it should not be interrupted.</p>

<h3>Public Works Bureau Tax Increase: Repercussions Ensue; Hotel License Fees Triple; Taxpayers Express Dissatisfaction with White Russian Unit</h3>
<p>Since the Public Works Bureau announced its intention to balance its budget and increase taxes, citizens have been apprehensive and uneasy. The Shanghai Hotel Association has sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession and Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a Chinese Director of the Public Works Bureau, seeking justice and assistance, as the Bureau has increased business license fees for the hotel industry by more than one and a half times. Excerpts from the original letter are as follows:</p>
<h3>Alarming Tax Rate Increase</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: According to reports from various members of our Association, they have recently received notifications from the Public Works Bureau stating that, effective April 1st of this year, all business license fees will be increased according to the original amount, with increases ranging from 150% to 200%. Our members are facing such a substantial tax increase that they not only cannot afford it but also risk being forced to close down. Therefore, we are compelled to request your Association's swift assistance to maintain our businesses. During the five or six years from the January 28th Incident to the August 13th Incident, our industry suffered a sharp decline, with few customers, and many businesses faced the threat of closure. Many shut down and changed ownership. Although there has been a turnaround in the past year or two, we are still struggling to recover from past losses. Moreover, due to the rampant inflation of prices recently, it is even more difficult to make a profit. We will not discuss the high prices of all supplies for now, but just take coal as an example. Each ton costs over 250 yuan. The amount of coal used by each hotel per day (taking a medium- to lower-class hotel with fifty rooms that does not use water heating during the off-season) is at least two baskets to half a ton (and one to two tons when using water heating). The daily room revenue may not even be enough to cover the cost of coal alone. Although our members have slightly increased prices, it is a drop in the bucket and does not make up for the losses. Furthermore, water, electricity, food, salaries, rent, and everything else have increased significantly. Under these circumstances, what profit can be made? It is reasonable for the Public Works Bureau to moderately increase taxes to balance its budget, but the increase in tax rates, from 150% to 200%, is unprecedented.</p>
<h3>Unstable Recovery, Unbearable Burden</h3>
<p>As for whether the Public Works Bureau's expenditures are reasonable, we will leave that aside. Should the hotel industry bear the responsibility for balancing the budget? It is said that tax collectors must first cultivate tax sources. Our hotel industry is still in a period of unstable recovery and is in urgent need of nurturing. The sudden imposition of such an unaffordable tax rate is not only akin to extortion but is also intended to kill our industry. For the survival of all our members, our Association must cry out loudly and seek assistance from all just parties. We also request your Association to forward a letter to the Public Works Bureau, asking them to carefully consider, promptly revoke this order, and make appropriate reductions to maintain the livelihood of our members. We earnestly pray for this. This is addressed to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession. The letter addressed to Mr. Yu Qiaqing roughly states: We believe that you, sir, are a leader of the community, treating the people as if they were injured. For decades, you have been righteous and chivalrous, and you have long been respected by all citizens. Moreover, you have been elected as a Chinese Director for many terms, and your words carry great weight in the Public Works Bureau. You will certainly be able to relieve the suffering of all our members. Therefore, we take the liberty of requesting your strong assistance to maintain the livelihood of all our members.</p>
<h3>What Kind of Work Does the White Russian Unit Do?</h3>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, taxpayers in this city are angered by the high cost of living in Shanghai and the impending increase in city taxes, which places a heavy burden on them. They intend to vent their anger on the White Russian unit of the foreign volunteer corps and ask what kind of work this unit does that makes it necessary to maintain. In fact, the work of the White Russian unit is very heavy. The following duties of the unit show a glimpse of this: The White Russian unit has a total of 13 officers and 311 soldiers of various ranks. At least 30 of them must be stationed at the headquarters of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps for a long time. 22 are drivers of transport vehicles, and 8 are messengers. The unit sends out 41 soldiers to guard the Bund floating dock, 28 to guard the Isolated Army camp on Jiaozhou Road and Singapore Road, and 18 to guard the Public Works Bureau Building and the Bund Volunteer Corps barracks. In total, 87 people perform their duties every day. In addition, 30 people are on standby at the Volunteer Corps headquarters at any time, ready to respond to any emergency calls. Thus, a total of 117 people are on duty or on standby every day, accounting for more than one-third of the entire unit. Anyone who has served in the military for a long time knows that the work of a unit with one-third of its personnel on duty every day is extremely heavy.</p>
<p>After their shifts, the soldiers do not simply eat and do nothing as some people imagine. In addition to those who have just rested after a 24-hour shift, those who are not on duty must train for riot control and firearms practice for five or six hours a day. The White Russian unit provides a great deal of assistance to the police department. For example, guarding the Bund floating dock helps protect police officers but does not involve inspections. The White Russian unit constantly assists the police department in conducting searches, and they set up a cordon around the houses being searched. The White Russian unit was established in January 1927 with two companies, and then a third company was added in February 1932 to reach its current strength. It was originally the police department's reserve force, avoiding the need to mobilize the Shanghai Volunteer Corps to deal with minor emergencies.</p>
<h3>US Warship Movements</h3>
<p>According to news from the US Navy, the US Yangtze River gunboat "Luzon" will set sail for Wuhu tomorrow morning (the 18th). Commander Glasford of the US Yangtze River Patrol Force was originally stationed on the "Luzon." Since the "Luzon" is about to leave Shanghai, he may remain in Shanghai and be stationed on the "Guam," which is about to arrive in Shanghai from Wuhu. However, there is no confirmed report on Glasford's whereabouts at this time. It is said that after the "Luzon" arrives in Wuhu, it will be stationed there for a month and then exchange positions with the "Guam." In addition, there has been no news as to whether the US cruisers Augusta and Marblehead will come to Shanghai after transferring to Qingdao and Yantai next month.</p>
<h3>Remote Prospects for Opening the Yangtze River; Japanese Side Uses Evasions</h3>
<h3>Spokesman for Japanese Embassy Says Matter Still Requires Further Discussion</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of opening the Yangtze River, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy said at a press conference, "After the establishment of the new Central Government," whether the issue of opening the Yangtze River falls within its legal jurisdiction to be resolved still needs to be discussed, or it may be decided by the newly established "government." However, the principle of the opening policy must be determined by the Japanese government in Tokyo. Whether it will be opened remains uncertain.</p>
<h3>Price Stabilization: Developments Expected;</h3>
<h3>Several Systems to be Implemented Soon</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the Price Stabilization Subcommittee recently established by the French Concession Municipal Council and the Public Concession Public Works Bureau to investigate the abnormal living conditions and propose improvement measures is currently carrying out its work smoothly. Although no concrete steps may be taken until the current investigation work is completed, full cooperation between the Municipal Council and the Public Works Bureau has now been implemented, and several systems are expected to be developed soon. About ten days ago, the two subcommittees held a preliminary meeting to formulate a plan for conducting the investigation.</p>
<h3>Public Works Bureau American Director Candidate:</h3>
<h3>Mr. Allman's Remarks: He Values Good Governance and Economy Above All Else</h3>
<p>In this year's election for directors of the Public Works Bureau, the American community is enthusiastically supporting American lawyer Mr. Allman as a candidate. The American Association will begin preliminary elections to select two official candidates from among the three candidates, Mr. Allman, Mr. Cardin, and Mr. McDonald. It is said that Mr. Allman is likely to be selected. According to Mr. Allman's statement on the election, "Many friends have recently urged me to run as a candidate for director of the Public Works Bureau. I have reluctantly complied with the wishes of my friends and am willing to be one of the candidates. I have been in China since 1916 and served in the American diplomatic and consular services for seven years. After resigning in 1923, I have been practicing law in Shanghai, with an office in the Public Concession. Since 1932, I have resided in the area beyond the concession boundaries, Anhe Temple Road, and paid city taxes to the Public Works Bureau for my residence and office. When the American Detachment of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps was established in 1923, I joined the unit. Having lived in Shanghai since 1921, I now hope to spend the rest of my life here. What I care about is that the Public Works Bureau should levy the lowest possible taxes commensurate with good governance and see the Public Works Bureau paying for current expenses and future obligations within the limits of its ability, based on a balanced budget. I cannot express my views on various municipal issues in this short letter. In fact, I have not yet considered many municipal issues in detail, so I cannot express intelligent opinions. But if I am nominated and elected, I will devote ample time to studying and understanding municipal issues one by one. In any case, I value good governance and economy above all else. I am not a candidate for any individual, company, or party. If nominated and elected, I will not be obligated to any private individual, but will regard myself as representing all the citizens of the Public Concession, regardless of whether they have the right to vote."</p>
<h3>Coal Briquette Sale Extension for Ten Days: Cooked Water Industry Decides to Request Direct Supply</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, at the request of the Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association, is seeking ways to help small coal briquette factories so that they can continue to ship goods and maintain operations. The Chamber held a joint meeting of various coal dust companies at its office on Hong Kong Road yesterday afternoon. Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Mr. Xu Jilong, Mr. Lin Kanghou, Mr. Yan Esheng, and representatives from coal companies such as Yitaixing, Dalongxing, Tongcheng, and Yicheng attended. All resolutions will be announced after being revised. It is reported that the coal briquette sale will be extended for ten days until early April.</p>
<p>The Cooked Water Industry Claims: There are more than 600 tiger stoves (boiled water vendors) in the two concessions, and 550 of them are members of the Association. Each household uses about 5 to 7 tons of coal per month, and the entire cooked water industry in the city needs about 3,000 tons of coal per month. Before the war, the price of coal was only about ten yuan per ton. In the past two years, the price of coal has gradually increased, and recently it has broken the 200 yuan mark. Under these circumstances, the general cooked water industry is operating on a small scale. How can they maintain their business?</p>
<p>The Only Solution is to request direct supply from the Kailuan Coal Company. We sincerely hope that all sectors of society will show sympathy and assistance. As for how to negotiate, it is not convenient to disclose at this time.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Rice and Wheat Arriving in Shanghai Again: Rice Prices Expected to Fall Sharply; Third Phase of Price Stabilization to Begin the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Public Works Bureau Police Department announced: The Shanghai Price Stabilization Committee has decided to resume price stabilization in the Public Concession and the French Concession starting on March 19th. Rice shops are entrusted to handle ticket sales and rice distribution from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM every day. Each ticket sells for 1 yuan in legal tender, and each yuan can buy 5.5 catties (market catties) of rice. The rice shops that issue tickets are listed on the ticket, and ticket holders can go directly to the respective rice shops to purchase. This kind of price stabilization is purely a charitable act intended to benefit people's livelihood. All rice buyers must be mindful of this purpose, strictly abide by order, and not cause trouble. Those who are unruly and cause trouble at the rice shops will be immediately arrested and severely punished.</p>
<p>The third phase of price stabilization will begin on March 19th. Eighty rice shops entrusted by the Rice Shop Association will handle the distribution. There will be 24 price stabilization locations in the Public Concession and 16 in the French Concession. Each location will sell 50 bags of rice per day. The Public Works Bureau Police Department of the Public Concession and the French Concession Municipal Council Police Department will send police to maintain order. It is reported that the third phase of price stabilization is scheduled for 20 days, with a daily budget of 2,000 bags, totaling about 40,000 bags of rice. The price stabilization donation funds are still significantly insufficient, so efforts are being made to continue soliciting donations from various industries, and it is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will actively donate.</p>
<p>Rice and Wheat Arriving in Droves: The Continental Daily News reports that yesterday (the 15th), according to sources in the Shanghai business community, ships arriving in Shanghai from grain-producing areas recently have been carrying large quantities of food, especially rice and wheat, so food prices are expected to "fall sharply" within days. In the past week, no less than 200,000 bags of rice and wheat have been shipped to Shanghai, and it is expected that even more rice and wheat will be shipped here in the next few days. The Norwegian ship "Angarnes," carrying 16,000 bags of rice, arrived from Saigon yesterday. The Norwegian ship "Fram," carrying 25,000 bags of rice, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Saigon on the 16th. The Danish ship "Nordvand," sailing from Australia, is carrying over 7,500 tons of wheat and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 18th. Although domestic rice shipped from the river is still scarce, it is reported that domestic rice "smuggled" by trucks from rice-producing areas to the two concessions reaches more than 20 vehicles per day and is increasing.</p>
<p>Rice Subsidy Amount: The Public Works Bureau has previously decided to issue rice subsidies to its Chinese employees with monthly salaries of 100 yuan or less to show its concern. It is now learned that the amount of this rice subsidy for March is 6 yuan and 7 jiao. The Shanghai Postal Administration's issue of increasing rice subsidies for employees, after being approved by the Kunming Postal Administration, has now established a rice price assessment committee, with Postmaster Zha Peilin as the chairman and the heads of various sections as members. Patrol officers are also assigned to investigate market rice prices at any time to balance the calculation. The subsidy method is based on a rice price of 30 yuan (per stone) as the standard. If this number is exceeded, the bureau will balance and provide rice subsidies. In addition to March, the bureau will also balance and investigate the rice prices at that time and provide subsidies for January and February. The above-mentioned subsidies have been issued in full by the bureau yesterday.</p>
<h3>British and French Ambassadors to China Reportedly Returning to Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to well-informed sources, British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr and French Ambassador Cosme will jointly return to Shanghai from Chongqing soon. It is also learned that Sir Clark Kerr has completed his mission in Chongqing for two months of contact with diplomatic authorities, so he is scheduled to depart for Shanghai in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Civilian Women and Children's Hospital Fundraising: Target of 50,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Civilian Women and Children's Hospital is launching a fundraising campaign to raise operating expenses, with a target of 50,000 yuan. The hospital provides free childbirth services, benefiting the poor and needy. The following is a brief history of the hospital and the details of this fundraising campaign:</p>
<p>Brief History of the Hospital: In the autumn of 1937, Shanghai was affected by the war, and no fewer than 200,000 refugees from the suburbs sought refuge in the concessions, enduring much hardship. Pregnant women, in particular, could not be sent to the hospital on time, especially after curfew at night, which was even more dangerous. Various charitable organizations, such as the International Red Cross, the International Relief Committee, the Shanghai Women's Association, the Shanghai Youth Association, the Public Works Bureau Health Department, the Salvation Army, and the Chinese Child Welfare Association, discussed repeatedly and proposed setting up a maternity shelter near the hospital to provide pregnant women with adequate nutrition and avoid the danger of rushing around when labor began. Therefore, it was jointly decided to organize the hospital. The original site was at 110 Robison Road. Since its establishment, it has been unanimously supported by Chinese and foreign people, and refugee pregnant women have benefited greatly. The hospital's maternal mortality rate is only about 1%, which is better than any refugee hospital. Recently, the hospital moved to 737 Weihaiwei Road because the lease of the Robison Road building had expired.</p>
<p>Social Needs: Based on one and a half years of experience, the hospital knows that the poor in Shanghai urgently need the hospital. Among all the hospitals in Shanghai, there is no free childbirth service. The only one is Tongren Hospital, but the number of beds is limited, and those who arrive later often have no chance. Although the hospital currently has 50 beds, it is still not enough, so it is urgently necessary to expand. The current director of the hospital is Dr. Shen Jiying. Shen was a pediatrician at Peking Union Medical College and has served in the Peking Health Bureau and the Children's Welfare Committee. Dr. Shen, with his rich experience and enthusiasm for service, has formulated a service network in Shanghai to meet the needs of maternity services in Shanghai and strive for popularization. Two centers have been established: one is the industrial department of the YWCA, and the other is the refugee shelter on Dunxin Road. The hospital is also studying ways to provide services to pregnant women who cannot leave their homes to be hospitalized during childbirth.</p>
<p>Fundraising Campaign: To maintain the above-mentioned services and to find a suitable site for the hospital once and for all, a fundraising campaign is now being launched, with a target of 50,000 yuan. It is hoped that Chinese and foreign people will enthusiastically support it. A donation of 20 yuan in national currency can cover the cost of one childbirth. A donation of 500 yuan can maintain the annual cost of one maternity bed (available for free use by 25 pregnant women per year). All donations can be sent directly to Yu Zhongkui, Honorary Accountant, Room 512, 113 Jiujiang Road.</p>
<p>Sponsors: The sponsors and team leaders for this fundraising campaign are listed as follows: Chairman of the Management Committee Pan Zhiquan. Sponsors are Mrs. Fei Xiu, wife of the German Ambassador; Mrs. Yan Huiqing; Zhu Chuanquan; Feng Bingnan; Lin Kanghou; Xu Hanxiang; Madden; Yuan Ludeng; Bu Fangji; and Xue Erge. The team leaders are Xu Hanqing, Mrs. Yao Naibin, Hou Xiangfan, Ma Bole, Zhang Tuolian, Tang Jiyun, Wei Bogui, Tang Xinghai, Mrs. Rong Xianlin, Mrs. Rong Mingsan, and Mrs. Luo Xiangyi. The chairman of the propaganda committee is Mrs. Yu Yingjie, the chairman of the economic committee is Lu Meiseng, and the consulting physicians are Wang Yihui, Wang Shuzhen, Bu Huade, and Xu Shixun. The director is Shen Jiying, and the chief physician is Geng Huizhen.</p>
<h3>American Residents in Shanghai Investigate War Losses: Damage Claims Group Established Last Week</h3>
<p>According to reports, American merchants and residents in the Shanghai concessions have suffered significant losses due to the Japanese military actions in China after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. Therefore, a "War Damage Claims Group" has been established to investigate the extent of the damage. The "War Damage Claims Group" was established last week and now hopes that American residents will report information to the group's new office at 209-217 Fuzhou Road for collection to serve as a basis for future negotiations.</p>
<h3>Japanese Factory Strike:</h3>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, 280 workers at the Gongxing Iron Factory (transliteration), a Japanese-owned factory at 710 Taopeng Road, Yangshupu, went on strike yesterday (the 15th) because a worker was beaten by a Japanese supervisor. In recent months, there have been many labor disputes in foreign-owned factories in the eastern district, but a strike at a Japanese factory is rare.</p>
<h3>Scout Troop Commemorates Scout Production Day: Mourning the Death of Founder Baden-Powell, Condolences Sent to Family</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday (the 15th) was the Chinese Scout Production Commemoration Day designated by the Ministry of Education and the General Association of Chinese Boy Scouts. Scout troops in the city held commemorative ceremonies, vowing to uphold the spirit of wisdom, benevolence, and courage, and to intensify production and serve the society and the country. In addition, they unanimously expressed their condolences for the recent death of world scout founder Baden-Powell in London. The Shanghai Scout Troop No. 2068 held a production day commemoration meeting at its troop headquarters the night before last at 7:30 PM. More than 100 members attended. Troop leader Ding Chuanlong reported the significance of the commemoration. The entire group observed a moment of silence for scout founder Baden-Powell and resolved to jointly send condolences to the Baden-Powell family with other scout troops.</p>

<h3>Banking Industry Supports Ministry's Order: Willing to Lend Price Stabilization Funds; Assist in Cracking Down on Manipulation of Necessities; Various Industries Prepare to Establish Price-Controlled Purchase and Sales Outlets</h3>
<p>In order to crack down on hoarding of daily necessities and implement price stabilization, Shanghai industry groups have decided to proceed in accordance with the Ministry of Economic Affairs' issued "Measures for Cracking Down on Hoarding and Price-Controlled Purchase and Sales." Regarding the operating funds for the price-controlled purchase and sales outlets, in addition to the four banks (Central, China, Communications, and Agriculture) agreeing to allocate funds in stages according to actual needs, commercial banks and money shops are willing to fully cooperate. However, their accounting will be directly audited and supervised by those responsible for the operating funds. If the profits from the purchase and sales outlets are insufficient to cover expenses and there are losses, the government may be requested to allocate funds to supplement them. After the implementation of the above measures, it will be possible to eliminate the evils of middlemen monopolizing exorbitant profits, and people's livelihood will be greatly benefited. Financial institutions themselves can also benefit from stability. The reasons for the recent surge in prices are generally no more than: (1) imbalance between supply and demand, (2) rampant speculation, and (3) hoarding by domestic merchants. It is reported that various industries are studying and proceeding with the issue of establishing price-controlled purchase and sales outlets.</p>
<h3>Shareholder Bonuses Not Subject to Income Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday received a letter from Huachang Match Splint Co., Ltd. inquiring whether the company, in 1939, should deduct income tax from the additional 1.2% shareholder bonus and employee bonuses issued in addition to the 8% dividend already issued in accordance with regulations. The Chamber of Commerce explained that: "We have taken note of your letter. Employee bonuses belong to the category of remuneration income under Article 1, Category 2 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations and should be subject to income tax. However, shareholder bonuses are not within the scope of stock interest under Article 1, Category 3 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations. Moreover, Item 1 of the Collection Guidelines for Income Tax on Category 3 Securities and Deposits issued by the Ministry of Finance stipulates that stock interest is limited to dividends from limited companies and joint-stock limited companies. Therefore, shareholder bonuses are not required to be taxed by law."</p>
<h3>River Collision Tragedy Last Night: Japanese Merchant Ship Collides with False Police Ferry, Drowning Seven People Including Japanese Military Police</h3>
<p>At 11:00 PM the night before last (the 15th), a tragic incident occurred in the outer reaches of Lujiazui, Pudong, in which a Japanese ship collided with a false "Water Patrol Team" ferry, drowning seven people including two Japanese military police, one false female police officer, and four members of the false ferry's crew (captain, engineer, and sailors). The false "Police Bureau Water Patrol Corps" ferry No. Hu 10 operates daily from 7:00 AM to 11:00 PM between the Japanese Consulate Wharf in Hongkou and the Dongchang Road Wharf in Pudong, carrying "government officials" and Japanese officers and soldiers. It is commonly called the liaison boat. At 11:00 PM the night before last, the last boat departed from the Japanese Consulate Wharf to return to the Dongchang Road Wharf, carrying only seven people, including six Japanese military police and one "female police officer." The regular captain, Chen Jinlong, had already returned home and was not on board. The second captain, Zhuang Jinlong, was driving. When sailing to the outer reaches of Lujiazui, Pudong, it was struck by the Japanese merchant ship "Taigu Maru No. 18" of the Tianshengang Line, fully loaded with passengers and goods for export.</p>
<p>In the darkness, the two sides met and were unable to avoid each other. The bow of the "Water Patrol Team" ferry was hit and a hole was made. The ship shook, and the river water poured in at the point of impact. It sank to the bottom in a few minutes. Passengers and crew members fell into the water at the same time. Nearby small boats rescued some people, but only four Japanese military police were rescued. One Japanese military police officer, one false "female police officer," the ferry's second captain Zhuang Jinlong, engineer Zhang Afa, Zhuang Jinlong's younger brother (a sailor), and a cook, totaling seven men and women, all drowned.</p>
<p>The bodies were submerged and untraceable. After the tragedy occurred, the Japanese naval military police team stationed on the Beijing Road Bund waterfront hotel dispatched troops by motorboat to the outer reaches of the accident site. The captain of the Taigu Maru was detained. The Taigu Maru, because it was carrying passengers and cargo, was allowed to leave. The captain was taken to the naval military police team, reprimanded for causing the accident and not providing rescue, slapped dozens of times, and detained for further investigation. Yesterday, the false "Water Patrol Team" and the Japanese military police team dispatched small boats to salvage the bodies of the seven Chinese and Japanese men and women who were killed. As of last night, they had not been recovered.</p>
<h3>Arts and Disaster Relief Fair Opens Yesterday; Over 5,000 Visitors; Children's Health Competition Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Native-Place Group Fundraising Committee held an Arts and Disaster Relief event at the New World, attended by more than twenty people, including Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Xu Xiaochu, Ge Futian, and Lin Daji. Yuan Luhou cut the ribbon. Yesterday's performances were extremely brilliant, and slogans were posted everywhere, such as "Tens of thousands of child refugees are starving to death," and "Watch a play and help with disaster relief – it's a win-win." The crowd that went to see the show yesterday reached more than 5,000 people. Today's program is even more exciting than yesterday, with Peking Opera from the Hua Lian Tong Le Hui, a spoken drama from the Universal Student Association, and a new Changzhou-Wuxi opera from the Changzhou-Wuxi Drama Art Improvement Association. There will also be a children's health competition at 2:00 PM, with generous prizes donated by various pharmacies, companies, and factories.</p>
<h3>Maid Accuses Employer of Rape and Abandonment</h3>
<p>Huang Meixian, a Shaoxing woman residing at No. 29, North Lane, Cihou Lane, Hartung Road, is 21 years old this year. She has hired three lawyers, Yan Guchang, Jin Yu, and Zhu Dianqing, to represent her in a private prosecution at the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court against He Zhaoting (66 years old), a Ningbo native residing at No. 84, Pushi Road, accusing him of using his authority to coerce and rape her, thereby undermining public morals. According to her statement, the plaintiff was hired by the defendant as a maid when she was 15 years old. Last spring, the defendant's concubine fell ill, and the plaintiff served her medicine. On the second day of the fourth lunar month of the same year, the defendant forcibly raped her and promised to take the plaintiff as a concubine. Afterwards, she was raped again, which was discovered by his concubine, who planned to expel the plaintiff. When she questioned the defendant, he initially made empty promises, but then ignored her altogether. Having no choice, she moved out. Since then, the defendant has completely ignored her. The defendant has committed a crime under Article 221 of the Criminal Law, and she requests that the court investigate and prosecute him according to the law. According to the complaint, the court opened a hearing yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, presided over by Judge Miao Qingbang. The plaintiff and her three lawyers arrived in court, stating the circumstances of the rape and abandonment. The defendant also arrived in court with his defense lawyer, Wang Hengyi, absolutely denying that he had raped the plaintiff, claiming that it was a malicious accusation and requesting a thorough investigation. After reviewing the statements, the court decided that the case still needed to be investigated and adjourned the hearing to the 26th.</p>
<h3>YMCA of Eight Immortals Bridge Sues Tenants for Rent Arrears</h3>
<p>The YMCA of Eight Immortals Bridge in the French Concession had previously had a dispute with its member tenants over the increase in dormitory rent, which has not yet been resolved. Recently, the association has hired lawyers to file lawsuits in the Special No. 2 Court against many tenants for rent arrears. The general situation has been reported in the newspapers. It is now known that Judge Yu Changzi of the court heard the case yesterday afternoon. The defendants being sued included Qian Kangsan, who owed 589 yuan in rent, Wu Dingzhen, who owed 745 yuan and one dime, Cheng Jianhou, who owed 660 yuan, and Kuang Zhongmou, who owed 801 yuan, two dimes, and nine cents. After a brief hearing in court, they were instructed to settle out of court, and the hearing was adjourned.</p>
<h3>College Student Living with Girlfriend Arrested for Stealing Her Possessions; Stealing Lover's Belongings and Disappearing; Reported to Police; Arrested; Ordered to be Detained Pending Investigation and Interrogation</h3>
<p>Zhu Danming, a local woman aged 19 (also known as Yan Danming because she later took the surname Yan), had studied at a certain prestigious girls' school in the city. Because her family was relatively well-off, Ms. Zhu also had some savings. About a year ago, Zhu met Li Youhuan, a Guangdong native aged 24 studying at the law school (resident of No. 657, Baker Road, son of Li Menghuan of Guangdong), and they fell in love.</p>
<p>Rented a house and lived together. The location of their cohabitation was No. 2, Sanyi Lane, Xinzha Road. After they started living together, the woman became pregnant and is now eight months pregnant. Recently, Li, perhaps because Ms. Zhu's money had run out, began to feel disgusted with her. Luo Yanong had previously borrowed 1,000 yuan from Ms. Zhu, and when he went to Sanyi Lane on the 9th of the month to return the 1,000 yuan to Ms. Zhu, both Zhu and Li were present. Zhu put the money into a chest. However, since that day, Li suddenly</p>
<p>Stopped coming altogether To Ms. Zhu's place. When Ms. Zhu opened the chest on the 14th to retrieve something, she discovered that the 1,000 yuan in legal tender returned by Luo, as well as a diamond ring worth 900 yuan and a gold ring, had disappeared. Since no one else had been to the house, it was obviously stolen by Li. Therefore, on the 15th, she reported it to the Xinzha police station. After the Chinese detective Xu Zhengting went to the law school to investigate, he found that Li had not attended school since the 9th. When he went to Li's father's place, he said that he never interfered with his son's affairs and actions. It was not until 8:30 PM the day before yesterday that he was</p>
<p>Li was arrested at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Chengdu Road. Yesterday morning, he was sent to Criminal Court No. 8 of the Special No. 1 Court. Police lawyer Peng Qixin requested permission for temporary detention because the case still needed to be investigated in detail. Ms. Zhu also hired lawyer Zhang Fukang to come to court and brought a civil suit. When questioned, Li denied that he was present when Luo Yanong handed over the money and denied stealing the money and jewelry. After Judge Dai Rongduo reviewed the statements, he ordered Li Youhuan to be detained and adjourned the hearing for further review.</p>
<h3>Local Briefs</h3>
<p>There are about 200 workers in the gilding industry in this city, specializing in gilding grass-cloth hats and book trademarks. Their wages are meager. Due to the high cost of goods, they have demanded that management improve their treatment. Because this was not accepted by management, a work slowdown began on the 13th. After three days, it has not yet been resolved. Worker representatives Ni Shijiu and others went to Ningbo yesterday to petition the local association and the political department of the central police, requesting mediation to maintain the workers' livelihood. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from the Zhejiang Provincial Government yesterday, acknowledging receipt of the telegram regarding the prohibition of navigation at Haimen and stating that the request for Taiyuan Wood Company to hire a special ship to transport timber could not be approved.

<p>The local sauce and liquor industry once made significant progress in contributing additional donations, but it was later suspended for some reason. It is now heard that the industry, after being encouraged by the association, has scheduled a meeting at the Shipping Club at 2:00 PM on the 19th of this month to discuss ways to continue making donations.</p>
<p>The Zhou Bichu solo landscape oil painting exhibition being held in the painting hall on the fourth floor of the Great World Department Store is on its fourth day today (the 17th).

<h3>Opportunity to Study National Affairs; Mr. Feng Shujin Generously Supports the Student Association</h3>
<p>Last year, in my spare time, I joined the Silver Money Friendship Association's Silver Money Remedial Night School to study Chinese. Teacher Zhou Shaochun's patient and encouraging teaching made me feel like I was bathed in the warmth of spring. I felt that such a good teacher was rare. This spring, the association continued to run the night school, designating the Chinese language course as a specialized class, which began on March 15th at the Minsheng Middle School on Beijing Road. Teacher Zhou was again hired as the professor, and many people joined. Last year, the association limited the admission qualifications to people in the silver money industry. Now, in order to popularize part-time continuing education, outside men and women are also admitted with modified requirements. However, in this autumn of high prices and difficult living conditions, many workers in various industries, limited by their financial situation, are unable to study. Therefore, I especially wish to offer a modest subsidy for one semester's tuition (limited to ten people) to those who are ambitious to learn but lack the means to do so if they join the Chinese language class. Those interested please send a letter to Feng Jinshu at the Central Savings Association in this city to discuss the matter.</p>
<h3>Compulsory Execution Law (1) Implemented on January 19th of this Year</h3>
<p>Compulsory execution is the final stage of judicial power and is extremely important. The civil procedure execution rules currently followed by various courts in our country were promulgated by the Beijing government's Ministry of Justice on August 3, 1920, and amended by the Beijing Ministry in January 23 and December 4, 1925. In accordance with the National Government's order of August 12, 1927, it was temporarily approved for reference. Later, on May 22, 1932, the Judicial Administration Department issued a circular ordering the implementation of supplementary civil execution measures. The Compulsory Execution Law, promulgated by the National Government on January 19 of this year, contains a total of 142 articles and is related to current court lawyers, litigants, and relevant third parties. It is specially excerpted on the left:</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor of Shen Bao, I respectfully write to you regarding a news item on page 10 of today's newspaper, which states "The Anderson Electric Bulb Factory Work Stoppage Resolved." I am extremely surprised. (1) Our factory has approximately 800 employees, not more than 1,500. (2) Our factory address is 140 Shengli Road, which is far from Jiaozhou Road. (3) The employees' request is for rice subsidies, not a wage increase. (4) This matter occurred at 4:00 PM on February 27th and was resolved satisfactorily at 10:00 PM that night. There was no work stoppage. The report is inaccurate. Therefore, I am writing to you to request that you correct the news item in tomorrow's newspaper. Respectfully, General Manager of Odd Anderson Electric Company, March 15th.</p>

<h3>Finance: Loans Due and Redemption Urged; Gold Prices Want to Rise but are Obstructed; Opening Price Again Surges Past 5,100 Yuan; US and British Exchange Rates Expected to Rise Again Today</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold secret market conditions opened strong, but the rise was fleeting and quickly declined. This was because the US exchange rate was initially tight and then hard, and speculative traders had loans due, and were forced to sell by HSBC to redeem them, causing most of the early gains to be lost. The opening rose because the US exchange rate was tight, coupled with Hong Kong trading, and retail investors also followed suit, so it jumped 97 yuan to a high of 5,130 yuan under competitive buying. Unexpectedly, the foreign exchange stopped tightening due to Hong Kong electricity's efforts to sell pounds and buy dollars. Futures suddenly loosened across the board. There are reports today that the US and British exchange rates are expected to rise again. Securities traders took advantage of the high prices to sell heavily, and spot traders also fiercely sold in succession, so it retreated to 5,054 yuan. Later, money exchange businesses suddenly bought in, and securities traders also turned from selling to buying, so it rose again to 5,080 yuan, but spot traders saw the opportunity to sell again, and silver shop businesses slightly sold, and the US exchange rate also hardened at that time, down to a low price of 5,050 yuan. At noon, a certain silver shop bought in cheaply, so by the time of noon closing, it was still at 5,065 yuan. As a result, it squeezed up 32 yuan. The outside potential was still good in the afternoon, and the final price was 5,070 yuan. Trading was still brisk for half a day, about 3,000 taels or so. Gold jewelry in silver shops was initially high and then low, ultimately remaining flat. Customs gold and other items remained fixed.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Rises by 32 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning (per bar, ten taels), the initial opening was strong due to the tight US exchange rate and renewed confidence. The buying voices on the table were deafening, especially the money exchange businesses, which were even more eager to buy, and sellers temporarily stood aside to watch the situation. Therefore, it opened late until 9:30, jumping horizontally by 97 yuan. A certain money exchange business bought 50 taels, at 5,130 yuan. Securities traders readily sold, and spot traders also scrambled to sell in succession, plus the exchange rate had already reported a hardening, the price suddenly turned sharply downward, and soon fell back 76 yuan. Securities traders sold 50 taels to money exchange businesses, at 5,054 yuan. After this, money exchange businesses suddenly bought in, and at the same time a certain securities business also turned from selling to buying, so it pulled up another 26 yuan. A silver shop bought 30 taels from a money exchange business, at 5,080 yuan. Then the US exchange rate continued to report hardening, and silver shop businesses resumed selling, and at the same time silver shop businesses also sold, and it fell back another 30 yuan. A gold shop sold 20 taels to a certain silver shop, at 5,050 yuan. At noon, short sellers in the securities business made peace and covered their positions, and again raised the price by 18 yuan. The securities business did 50 taels, at 5,068 yuan. Then a silver shop business sold 50 taels to a silver shop, at 5,065 yuan as the noon closing price. As a result, it squeezed up 32 yuan compared to the previous day. The range was 80 yuan for half a day. The selling price of the spot traders' gold was several yuan higher than the spot gold price, and the buying price was reduced by 20 yuan. The spot gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little trading.</p>
<p>Gold Jewelry Initially High and Then Low</p>
<p>Silver shop gold jewelry, per tael, was still listed at 510 yuan by Da Tong Heng at the beginning. At 9:40, it was raised by 5 yuan, and at 10:20, it fell back by a small 5 yuan. There were no changes after this, ultimately remaining flat. Da Tong Heng still listed at 510 yuan, and the new counterparts were the same as the above price, with the buying price reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Major Foreign Exchange Players Rarely Act</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed prices unchanged. In the unofficial market for British and American currencies, trading fluctuations were narrow throughout the half-day, indicating a stable underlying trend. Speculators and major players largely remained on the sidelines, rarely acting. However, many smaller holders, taking advantage of this lull, were willing to sell, resulting in the final prices being roughly the same as the previous night's close, with no clear gains or losses. Initially, overseas British and American exchange rates continued to narrow by seventy-five points, causing the opening market to show a stable British pound and a tight US dollar, quoted at 4/16 1/8士 (shì) 125 and 6.34375 yuan respectively. Subsequently, due to a lack of supply of US dollars from foreign banks, the market quietly tightened again, reaching 6.325 yuan. Later, speculators, taking profits from their floating gains, frequently sold off, and American banks showed a stronger willingness to sell, gradually leveling the market. By the close, British gold 4/16 1/8士 (shì) 125 and US dollars 6.375 yuan, were similar to the previous day. Futures prices hardened slightly, and swaps narrowed slightly.</p>
<p>British and American Futures Narrow</p>
<p>At the start of the morning, London's large contracts, both near and far terms, increased by twenty-five points. New York silver prices remained flat, and London gold prices remained stable. Exchange rates for the British pound against Shanghai, France, and other currencies were flat. The US dollar narrowed by seventy-five points against the British pound, fell by one dime against Shanghai, and fell slightly against France. Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. Banks opened for spot trading in the morning with British gold at 4/16 1/8士 (shì) 125 and British exchange at 6.34375 yuan, a stable British pound and tight US dollar by 0.03125 compared to the previous close, due to the continued decline in exchange rates. After opening, due to a lack of selling interest from foreign banks, the US dollar continued to soften quietly, with spot trading only possible at 6.3125 yuan, but transactions were rare. HSBC's listed prices were announced unchanged. The silver balance tax was announced at one and a half points higher. Thereafter, Chinese merchants, taking advantage of the high prices, sold this month's US dollar contracts to foreign banks at 6.3125 yuan. Subsequently, a certain Chinese bank, acting on behalf of Hong Kong interests, bought British pounds and sold US dollars, absorbing this month's British gold at 4/16士 (shì) 0.078125 and simultaneously selling this month's US dollars at 6.34375 yuan, arbitraging the British-American exchange rate at approximately 3.7325 yuan. Around 10:15 AM, speculators continued to sell, and American banks also showed a willingness to supply, causing the market to return to normal. A certain bank sold next month's US dollar contracts to foreign firms at 6.21875 yuan and sold May British gold contracts to Japanese firms at 3/16士 (shì) 0.984375. Later, Chinese merchants again sold this month's US dollar contracts to Cargill and other firms at 6.275 yuan, and next month's US dollar contracts at 6.25 yuan. As a result, futures trading weakened slightly, and transactions gradually cleared up at noon, creating a very quiet situation. By the close, British gold was at 4/16士 (shì) 125, US dollars at 6.375 yuan, this month's British gold at 4/16士 (shì) 0.09375, US dollars at 6.34375 yuan, next month's British gold at 4/16士 (shì) 46875, and US dollars at 6.25 yuan. The final result was that spot prices for British and American currencies were unchanged from the previous day, while this month's futures for British pounds rose by 0.015625 and US dollars hardened by 0.03125, next month's contracts fell significantly by 0.03225 and US dollars fell by 0.0625. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong US Dollar Weakens</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 16th (Saturday) dispatch: This morning, the exchange market opened with a stable British pound and a volatile US dollar. British pound and US dollar counter prices remained unchanged. Spot Shanghai exchange rose by 25 cents, to 359.35 yuan. Spot Japanese exchange weakened by 50 cents, to 96.50 yuan. At 10:10 AM, the US dollar showed a slight hardening trend, with spot weakening by 0.0625, to 22.875 yuan, and forward opening at 22.8125 yuan. At 10:50 AM, it stabilized, with the US dollar spot continuing to weaken by 0.0625, to 22.9275 yuan, while forward remained unchanged, still opening at 22.8125 yuan. At 11:30 AM, it was reported as flat, with no changes in any exchange rates. The market was stable at the noon close, with the US dollar spot weakening again by 0.0625, to 21.3 yuan, and forward still standing at the original level. Spot Shanghai exchange continued to decline by 75 cents, to 358.5 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.</p>
<p>Tianjin British and American Currencies Rise</p>
<p>Tianjin, 26th (Saturday) dispatch: This morning, the exchange market opened flat. Spot British exchange weakened slightly by 0.03125, to 3 pence 8125. Spot US exchange rose by 0.09375, to 5.905 yuan. Shanghai exchange fell by 1 yuan, to 107.50 yuan. The unofficial market for "Joint Currency" also rose by 1 yuan, to 1.05 yuan.</p>
<p>US Dollar Notes Rise in the Morning, Fall in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market remained volatile, especially for US dollar notes. In the early morning, foreign exchange was reported tight, with strong demand from dealers. Market bonds even rose to 15.76 yuan. Later, a Hong Kong telegram suddenly reported the purchase of British pounds and sale of US dollars, undoubtedly indicating hopes for a turnaround in today's London telegraphic exchange rate, and those taking profits rushed to sell. By late morning, it had retreated to 15.53 yuan, and further declined to 48 cents in the afternoon, eventually settling at 15.50 yuan. The result showed no significant difference from the previous day's price. Conversely, British gold notes gradually gained favor, while Hong Kong notes and notes from Singapore, the Netherlands, Annam, Robbie, Canada, and the Philippines showed a weakening trend. The underlying trend for British and American gold pounds remained stable. The decline in Japanese gold notes and Korean notes was quelled, with the former rising to 1.30 yuan and the latter rising to 0.99 yuan. Yesterday's market prices saw an increase of five points for British leftover notes, and a decrease of five points for Hong Kong notes and notes from Singapore, the Netherlands, Annam, Robbie, Canada, and the Philippines, while all others remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Food Grains Rice Prices Fall Frequently</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market continued to see a decline in prices. Although sentiment was still firm in the early morning, with hoarders reluctant to sell easily, the continuous arrival of large quantities of imported rice on the way made it unlikely that the market would rebound in the short term. Speculators and original merchants alike also released their holdings, causing the market to decline further. As a result, prices for various goods fell again by half a yuan to one yuan, while overall trading volume remained low, with no more than three to four thousand bags traded. Original-packed No. 2 Saigon rice was priced at 47.50 yuan, and small-lot rice was priced at 47 yuan. After more than three hundred tons were released, there were few buyers, resulting in a price reduction of two, three, or four cents for spot rice, and futures also showed a weak trend.</p>
<p>The demand for glutinous rice was already small, and in the current environment, sellers were unable to maintain prices and lowered them by around half a yuan. Although the arrival of domestic rice such as thick and thin japonica and early and late indica varieties has been limited in recent days, with only three to five hundred bags transferred from Hongkou yesterday, the continuous decline in imported rice prices inevitably had a restraining effect, leading to even quieter trading in the unofficial market, and prices continued to fall by one yuan. High-quality japonica was only priced at 47-48 yuan, medium-quality rice at only 44-45 yuan, and special thin indica at 45-46 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Sales Were Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market was quite weak. Since the lifting of the export ban, sales have been inactive. Tianjin and Beijing have already purchased large quantities of flour from Japan, Manchuria, and Australia, and the authorities are paying close attention to the market for returned goods. As a result, mills are repeatedly urging the pickup of their warehouse receipts, and holders are unable to fully manipulate the market. However, with current imported wheat prices at 35 yuan, the calculated flour price is above 14 yuan per bag, so the market may not be too weak. Unified market prices opened at 14.35 to 14.37 yuan for old car brands, and 14 yuan for Battleship brand, down slightly by one or two cents from before. There were no other official prices.</p>
<p>Wheat also showed weakness yesterday. The weak trend in the flour market and the repeated declines in rice prices both affected the wheat market. Suzhou wheat opened at 24.15 yuan, and Changzhou-Wuxi wheat opened at 14 yuan, down another five or six cents from before. A total of five or six truckloads were traded.</p>
<h3>Securities New Business Regulations of the Public Industry Association Domestic Debt Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>The unofficial securities market remained firm yesterday. Expectations of actual benefits from Britain's verbal promises led to stronger defenses on the part of many. The losses caused by the previous tight foreign exchange and rising gold prices have now been more than recovered, and it is unlikely that there will be any significant changes in the short term. There is talk of adding disguised futures trading, but due to the involvement of too many parties, it is unlikely to materialize quickly. This has encouraged and comforted many, as it can avoid the burden of interest. Yesterday, foreign exchange and gold were both stable in the morning, which also stabilized public bonds. Type A and E saw slight increases, Type B and C remained flat, and Type D was not yet available. In the afternoon, demand from retail investors was strongest. Shun Kang Hongda also bought in significantly, while Jiufeng sold out significantly. Yichang and Xieda also made some sales, causing market prices to strengthen. As a result, prices rose again by about 10 to 20 cents, with a transaction volume of over 900,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>---|---|---|---</p>
<p>(Table data would go here if provided)</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 30 shares of Coal Industry Bank were traded at 50 yuan each.</p>
<p>Shanghai Public Industry Association Business Regulations: Monday to Friday are the trading period for each settlement. Saturday is a holiday. On Monday (A), shares must be paid for in whole numbers. (B) Buyers may receive shares from their brokers only on Monday, but must pay by 11:00 AM.

(C) Brokers who have arranged with their banks to pledge shares for loans must follow the following procedure: Their bank obtains a receipt format containing "A certain bank receives a certain number of shares of a certain company from the HSBC account of a certain broker, payable in national currency of so many yuan." This format must be approved by the lending bank and is equivalent to a receipt for the shares, to be given to the broker before 11:00 AM. On Tuesday, brokers pay customers with shares starting at 11:00 AM. These regulations shall be implemented starting on Monday, March 18, 1940.</p>
<p>London, 15th (Friday) dispatch: Today's listed prices for British companies in the Far East showed a rebound. Jardine Matheson shares rose 1 shilling 3 pence, to 9 pounds 6 shillings 3 pence. HSBC shares each rose half a pound, with British registered shares at 91.5 pounds and Hong Kong registered shares at 92 pounds. All others remained unchanged.</p>
<p>London, 15th (Friday) dispatch: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt remained stable, with no changes in any bonds.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Cantonese Sales Are Not Weak Major Cotton Yarn Players Continue to Buy</h3>
<p>The yarn market remains firm, but some are selling due to the belief that the base price is already too high. However, many believe the outlook is good because factories are unwilling to release yarn, keeping the chips locked up, so market fluctuations are significant. Market trading is particularly active, and market prices fluctuate. At the same time, sales to Guangdong are also not weak. As a result, long position holders are still unwilling to give up their goods. The increase in trading of April Double Horse yarn, the price opened today at 980 yuan, and closed at 992 yuan. Currently, the prices of 32-count and 42-count yarns are very high, and 20-count yarn is also related, so there are more buyers.</p>
<p>Spot yarn opened in the morning, continuing the weak momentum from the previous day, with the opening price at 956 yuan. As soon as this price was announced, buyers flocked in, but in reality, they were all short-covering traders. In an instant, it rose to 970 yuan, and those taking profits sold off, causing it to fall back a few yuan. Later, it was heard that Guangdong's demand for Double Horse yarn remained strong, and major players were buying in, causing the market to slowly rise to 971 yuan at the close. Afterwards, it rose again. The half-day trading volume was 2,285 bales. Spot prices for 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 2 yuan. The amount purchased by each group is listed below.</p>
<h3>Ordering Is Now Cost-Effective Foreign Cotton Trading Is Particularly Active Over 10,000 Bales of Yao Cotton Arrive Again</h3>
<p>Trading in domestic cotton remains strong, but trading in American and Indian cotton is more active. This is because ordering is more cost-effective, and domestic cotton inventory is not high, and procurement is difficult. As a result, foreign cotton trading has increased. The source from northern Jiangsu is 707 bales of Tongzhou cotton. The current spot cotton trading situation is listed below.</p>
<p>In other news, foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was very quiet yesterday, with little trading among dealers. New Orleans was buying, and the closing prices were unchanged from the previous day for near-term contracts, and down three or four pounds for far-term contracts. India was predicted to rise by 2 rupees. Egypt's market was closed.</p>
<p>The trading of foreign cotton orders at Shanghai ports has been quite dull recently. All parties are exhibiting exceptional quiescence because of the uncertainty of exchange rate fluctuations. Mills ultimately find that buying cotton and spinning yarn results in too much cost loss, so they are temporarily unwilling to release cotton yarn to offset the cost of cotton. As a result, trading is sluggish. Japanese manufacturers are also very quiet. The factory price for cotton at yesterday's market, converted at an exchange rate of 6.375 yuan per US dollar, is as follows:</p>
<p>A batch of cotton purchased by American Hengda Foreign Company in eastern Zhejiang arrived yesterday morning on the Taikoo Company's Huangpu vessel from Ningbo, totaling 10,985 bales. It arrived at the port at around 7:00 AM yesterday and docked at the company's wharf in the French Concession, where it is being unloaded. It is said that after unloading the cotton from this vessel, it will continue to Ningbo to load more.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Dyeing and Printing Factories Adopt Domestic Cloth in Large Quantities South Seas Restrict Import Quotas</h3>
<p>The cloth market is very stable. Although export business to foreign countries has sharply decreased due to increasingly strict import quota restrictions in various parts of the South Seas, domestic sales to Zhejiang, Fujian, Yunnan, and Guangdong have suddenly increased. Dyeing factories and textile mills are adopting it in large quantities, and the supply and demand of gray cloth from wooden mills are quite responsive. As a result, domestic white cloth has been more popular than eastern piece goods recently. Yesterday, prices were stable. The wooden street traded over 300 pieces of fine cloth, twill, Ewo coarse cloth, and light-colored cloth. Zhejiang and Fujian buyers purchased over 200 pieces. Guangdong buyers purchased colored cloth, poplin, and printed cloth totaling over 100 pieces. Yunnan buyers purchased over 3,000 pieces of shirting, melton, etc. Northern Anhui, Bengbu, and southern Anhui, Wuhu, and other places purchased nearly 5,000 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, colored cloth, poplin, etc.</p>
<p>Yesterday's increase in the eastern cloth market was slightly restrained. The hoarding of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was affected by the increased rent of old warehouse receipts, and traders intended to close up, so buying became weak, and prices were shouted down by 1.5 cents per piece. The market once fell below 28 yuan, but new warehouse receipts still required 28.15 yuan. Wholesale sales of mid-range fine cloth and fine twill are very strong. Sales prices are generally stable. Because the Four Gentlemen's serge is in short supply due to the collection of spot goods by merchants from this street and Hankou, the market has opened for sale at 8.525 cents per yard.</p>
<h3>Raincoat Cloth Is Expensive</h3>
<p>Sales of raincoat cloth have been quite sluggish recently, but the market remains firm, due to limited stock. Yesterday, 4026 water repellent sold for 18.5 yuan per bale, Tianjin plain colored for 1.5 yuan, non-Saigon double-sided yarn for 3.8 yuan, first grade for 3.95 yuan, suede first grade for 2 yuan, second grade for 1.67 yuan, British-made double-sided yarn raincoat cloth for 12.5 yuan, and fleece for 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Yellow Beans Plunge by One Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's yellow bean market suddenly underwent a dramatic change, with prices plunging by over one yuan. This was due to the fact that some people were first affected by the environment, and second, by the decline of bean oil by 1.3 yuan, leading to a sharp contraction in buying interest, and many bulls rushing to sell. However, there were few buyers. Although some bought in at low prices along the way, causing the market to stabilize slightly, the supply was greater than the demand, making it difficult to sustain, and the result was still a fall. The overall market only traded 300 bags of Nanjing beans, priced at 12 yuan to 21.5 yuan, 700 bags of Wuhu beans, priced at 23 yuan to 22.4 yuan, one truckload of Yangzhou mountain beans, priced at 21 yuan, and 350 bags of Dingjiazhou beans, priced at 25.5 yuan to 25.3 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Raw Sugar Continues to Weaken</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend was relatively flat. The association set the price for spot goods at 62.5 yuan, down 0.5 yuan for both new arrivals at local warehouses and those at foreign warehouses. Old goods remained unchanged at 62.1 yuan to 62 yuan. Re-export goods maintained their original prices. Taikoo granulated white sugar did not fluctuate much, with B Mark Western warehouse at 67.1 yuan, Eastern light at 66.5 yuan, and all others remained unchanged. Domestic products also showed a steady trend, with limited trading.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods Superior Honey Dates Are Firm</h3>
<p>The demand for honey dates has been average recently, so ordinary oil-dipped dates have been very sluggish, selling for less than 90 yuan. However, because the inventory of Anhui goods is thin, they are relatively firm, selling for 120 yuan to 115 yuan. Upward and downward adjustments are made as usual.</p>
<h3>Orchid Bamboo Branches Decline</h3>
<p>Because sales of orchid bamboo branches have been hindered since a certain party crossed the river in eastern Zhejiang, they have been greatly affected. As a result, market prices have declined again recently, down two yuan yesterday. It will not be easy to rebound unless sales expand.</p>
<h3>On Mr. Ying Yongyu's Suggestion Defining the Scope of Payment Stoppage for Transfer Orders</h3>
<p>Mr. Ying Yongyu of the banking community recently sent a letter to the Banking Association, stating that bank transfer orders are widely circulated because of their convenience in remittance, but there are frequent disputes over payment stoppage. For example, Shengji and Zhejiang Xingye Bank have been publishing advertisements questioning each other daily. Also, recently someone altered a 200 yuan transfer order from Chouzhou Bank to 20,000 yuan. In order to promote the circulation of negotiable instruments and avoid future disputes, it should be stipulated that the reporting of loss and stoppage of payment for transfer orders should be limited to cases of fire, theft, or loss in transit, and should not be arbitrarily stopped. Or it should be stipulated that transfer orders payable to the bearer should not be reported lost and stopped. As for the issuer, they should be more careful beforehand, and the amount on the check should be written in correct and capitalized characters, and there should not be too much space left between the characters. It is best to use a numbering machine to punch the amount on the check to ensure caution and prevent alteration.</p>
<h3>New Situation and the Raw Silk Industry</h3>
<p>— Yi Zhi</p>
<p>Continued from the 13th</p>
<p>(III) Domestically, with the war progressing to a stalemate, the policy of "using war to sustain war" is bound to rely more and more on this, which will inevitably strengthen the pressure on the "control" of raw materials and the monopoly of the silk reeling industry. At the same time, the stalemate is characterized by more frequent fluid warfare in the occupied areas than before, and the other side's "security force" is increasingly ineffective. These two points have made the issue of cocoon procurement more complex and difficult than before. The humiliation and losses of last year will be even less guaranteed this year. So, will China's raw silk industry be manipulated by others? Being manipulated by others means being monopolized by others, so how can we say that the new situation is beneficial to the raw silk industry?</p>
<p>Originally, it is not absolutely without benefits here. For example, the frequency of mobile warfare is detrimental to "control." Where "control" is unfavorable, the free trade against control is beneficial. At the same time, the more "using war to sustain war" is relied upon, the weaker the aggressor becomes. This weakness will certainly also be reflected in the "control" force, which is also beneficial to the raw silk industry. Moreover, the phenomenon of the recovery of the silk industry in Shanghai in the past two years, whether someone says it is morbid or adventurous, in fact, such a recovery has broken the "control" of others, restored their own strength, and accumulated funds for upward development. This is the most fortunate thing in the past two years, and it is also the most optimistic thing for the future. This is a prediction for the domestic situation this year.</p>
<p>In summary, domestically, "control" will inevitably be tightened, but its power is weakening. As for the silk industry itself, it can only survive in anti-control management. (Cooperation and standing by are conducive to the monopoly of others, and waiting to die. Therefore, whether in buying orchids or changing silk, it is necessary to adopt an economic guerrilla attitude, have the determination to take advantage of every opportunity, and have the patience to accumulate small victories to achieve big purchases. It is necessary to be active, courageous, and uncompromisingly loyal to the development of one's own business. Ethnic capital in the occupied areas of China can only do this, and can also take the road to a bright future.</p>
<p>The raw silk industry in the new situation has the above-mentioned advantages. From a general perspective, it is now following the progress of the country and is increasingly moving towards a favorable direction. However, at this time and place, it is necessary to grasp the above-mentioned principles, and it is necessary to jump out of the traps of speculation, adventure, compromise, and selfishness. It is necessary to narrow the scope, preserve strength, and actively strive for freedom of operation to break through the "control" conspiracy, so as to save more power to prepare for the grand development of tomorrow.

<p>Old Newspapers Newly Copied Sixty-Seven Years Ago (1216) (See this newspaper from the twelfth year of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty) A Record of a Western Magician Performing a Play</p>
<p>The night before last, I went with my wife to Jinguixuan, where I saw carriages and horses bustling and people as thick as weaving, it was the night that a Western magician was performing on stage. The stage was brightly lit, and a Western woman was on stage, playing Western music, and the harmony was loud and clear, making one yearn for it. Then, a lion's head was placed on the table, which could speak like a human being. A bright lamp was hanging under the table, and one could see that it was empty, and the audience already sighed at its magic! After entering the arena, suddenly, the lights on and off the stage were extinguished, and the double curtains behind the stage were opened. With the light on, looking closely behind the curtain, there was a Western painting, depicting the scenery in the ocean, and at first, a wheel slowly passed by, and the sails and figures in the boat were all round and lifelike. Western music was played again, and the painting slowly rolled back, but I saw the long sky connected to the water, with a round boat encountering the wind, the light flickering, with a black wind blowing the sea, the reader sighed at the spectacle. All the lights were on, and a beautiful woman leisurely came out with the magician. The magician's clothes were like a Chinese Taoist, helping the woman stand upright facing outward, and drawing a talisman on her face with his hand, and the beautiful woman fell asleep. He supported her arm with two sticks, the arm stood up and her feet hung in the air, and she was bent by the magician, and all was as desired. Later, he removed one stick, suddenly like a great immortal, suddenly like a swordsman, and the lights were also green, yellow, red, and green, changing in a non-uniform manner, and the audience was already surprised to have never seen it before. Suddenly, the magician chanted words, hugged the woman and lay down horizontally, and took away a stick, and the beautiful woman flew in the air, suspended in the air, and the people in the theater could not help but clap and cheer. After a while, the magician took the woman down, and drew another talisman, and the beautiful woman stretched and yawned and woke up, as if nothing had happened. It was staring bright, and the top of the theater suddenly fell down with flowing springs and broken jade, and the hanging beads were滔滔不絕, either as急如驟雨, or as 细若鸣嘶, about half an hour, it was a true spectacle.</p>

<h3>The Importance of "Learning" and "Asking"</h3>
<p>— Jun Peng</p>
<p>—Do not be shy, do not be afraid of difficulty, do not be lazy—</p>
<p>The words "learning" and "asking" are linked and mutually supportive. No matter what subject we study, we must try our best to research it. For example, the most difficult and least progressive subject is writing. Why did I use this word and the teacher changed it? Why is this sentence not fluent? Why is the meaning too little? Why is it not on topic? Why can't I apply the sentences from the books I usually read? Why can't I express myself fluently? Also, like arithmetic, why can't I apply the formula? Why don't I understand this application problem? Why can this arithmetic problem be solved in this way or that way, and the answers are all correct? Children, have you ever thought about this? Have you ever asked yourselves? We should know that we must "think" beforehand, "think" out its principles, and be able to "apply" it. Otherwise, we are equal to "not learning." On the one hand, we must "work hard to learn," and on the other hand, we must "carefully ask." When "learning," we must listen attentively. When "asking," we must ask thoroughly. We cannot only know the how but not the why. The more we don't understand, the more we should ask. The more we ask, the more we will understand. However, only "learning" without "asking," or only "asking" without "learning," will not make progress, and there is no benefit. Perhaps the reason for your previous failure is this. The teacher works hard to explain, but the students still don't listen attentively. Even if they listen, they can't leave a deep impression on the brain. So you are like looking at flowers on horseback, meaningless. Or there are a few children who can read, memorize, and explain well, and the exam scores are very good, but they can't write well. This is because you can't read "living books" and apply "living books." You probably haven't asked the teacher what a "verb" is? What is an "adjective"? What is a "conjunction"? What is an "adverb"? What is a "pronoun"? Even if the teacher has explained it, you may not ask thoroughly. I think your writing scores are one of the worst subjects, and your other knowledge is not very good either!</p>
<p>Newton, seeing an apple falling from a tree, invented "gravity." Franklin, during snowfall, discovered the optical theory that white reflects and black absorbs light. Watt, seeing the kettle lid vibrating after the kettle boiled, invented the steam engine... These scientists all invented various "theories" because they "asked and learned a lot." I know that the reasons why you are unwilling to "ask" are nothing more than three: shyness, fear of difficulty, and laziness. So I hope that you quickly defeat these three "bad roots," and "learn" and "ask" at the same time, then your "learning" will improve every day!</p>
<h3>In Memoriam: Lord Baden-Powell, Founder of the Boy Scouts</h3>
<p>— Yang Zi Jiang</p>
<p>March 15th is designated as the Chu Boy Scout Day, a day of great joy. However, this year, the unfortunate news of the passing of Lord Baden-Powell, the founder of the Boy Scouts, has arrived. Everyone who learns of this feels deeply saddened.</p>
<p>Mr. Baden-Powell was a native of London, England. As a child, he studied at a London elementary school, where he was not only diligent but also enjoyed sports. At the age of nineteen, he left school to serve in the military, holding important positions such as Lieutenant General and Inspector-General of Cavalry. In the second quarter of 1907, Mr. Baden-Powell gathered twenty-five children on Brownsea Island, camping outdoors and teaching them various life skills, as well as cultivating the virtues of wisdom, benevolence, and courage. This marked the founding of the world's first Boy Scout troop. Later, Baden-Powell dedicated himself to the Boy Scout movement, establishing the Girl Guides, Cub Scouts, and Rover Scouts (an even higher level of Boy Scout training). These are now widespread in countries around the world. In 1929, the King of England awarded him a peerage for his contributions to Boy Scout education.</p>
<p>Since Mr. Baden-Powell founded the Boy Scouts, the organization has spread to over fifty countries, with a membership of over three million. Sadly, Mr. Baden-Powell passed away in Africa last year due to his advanced age. Boy Scouts around the world must feel a great sense of mourning upon hearing this news.</p>
<h3>Children's Health Competition</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Provincial Group Solicitation Committee will hold an entertainment fair at the New World Amusement Park starting from the 16th. Many entertainment acts will participate, and all ticket revenue will be donated to disaster relief. Many entertainment groups will participate, including Peking Opera, spoken drama, Shanghai opera, variety acts, etc. What we want to highlight here is that a children's health competition will also be held simultaneously.</p>
<p>According to the organizing committee's regulations, children of Chinese nationality aged two to twelve, regardless of gender, can participate, with their actual age as the standard. Children participating in the competition must pay a registration fee of one yuan when registering. After receiving a registration certificate, they can enter the venue daily without additional charges. The registration office is located at No. 6, Lane 102, Tongfu Road, within the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Provincial Group Solicitation Committee, and registration closes on the 15th. The general assembly will open on the 16th, and the competition will be held for five consecutive days starting on the 17th. After the competition, the results will be announced on the sixth day, and prize money and gifts will be awarded.</p>
<p>The judges and inspectors for the competition will be the doctors of the Shanghai Relief Branch's health group, invited by the association. The cash prizes and gifts are awarded as follows: first place (one person) will receive 100 yuan in national currency; second place (two people) will each receive 30 yuan; third place (ten people) will each receive 5 yuan; fourth place (fifty people) will each receive children's products worth three yuan. All other participating children will receive children's products and toys as appropriate. In addition to direct registration with the association, various schools are also encouraging elementary school students to register, so the number of participants is expected to be quite high.</p>
<p>Children, you probably all know that health is very important. With a healthy body, you will be able to shoulder important responsibilities when you grow up. In the city of Shanghai, children's health competitions are often held. If you have the opportunity, even if your parents are not prepared to take you to participate, you can ask your parents to register you. If you win a prize, it proves that your body is quite healthy. From then on, you should maintain this health permanently and even improve it. If you rank very low, it proves that your body is not very healthy. Then you should pay attention to hygiene and correct the shortcomings of your health. Therefore, participating in children's health competitions is very beneficial. I hope everyone will not neglect this matter!</p>
<h3>Brushstrokes</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Ziying</p>
<h3>Black Brothers (10)</h3>
<p>— Yi Mu</p>
<p>Such a beautiful morning, even without searching for the Golden River, could make one happy. Along the Han Valley, layers of mist spread out, and beyond the mist, towering mountains rose – their lower cliffs shrouded in pale gray shadows, almost indiscernible. But as the mist gradually dispersed, the cliffs touched the sunlight, revealing a distinct red hue. The beams of light further illuminated the pine trees, like spears, a vibrant green that caught the eye. Higher above, the red rocks were illuminated, jagged and transformed into various shapes. Patches of snow were scattered everywhere, shimmering in the sunlight. In the far distance, towering above everything else, fainter than the morning clouds, yet clear and still, lay the snow-capped peaks, resting in the azure sky.</p>
<p>The Golden River, leaping from the lower, snowless heights, was almost enveloped in dark clouds. In the highest part, something resembling floating water flowers slowly extended like smoke and mist above the waterfall, then drifted away in the morning breeze.</p>
<p>Hans's eyes and thoughts were completely focused on it. He forgot the distance and walked quickly, but before he had crossed a range of lower hills, he already felt very tired. What surprised him even more was that on these hills, he discovered a large glacier, lying across his path between him and the source of the Golden River, separating them. He bravely walked onto the surface of the river, intending to cross to the other side, the first time in his life he had crossed such a dangerous glacier. The ice surface of the river was very smooth, and the sound of rushing water often came from the cracks in the ice. This sound was not low and monotonous but very loud and constantly changing, especially loud, like someone singing wildly, then falling low into short, melancholy sounds, sometimes like people groaning in pain. Where Hans passed, the ice broke into thousands of chaotic pieces, each with a different shape. To his eyes, they did not seem like ordinary ice blocks but like strangely shaped human faces mocking him. From these countless broken ice pieces, thousands of pale rays of light flashed, dazzling his eyes. And after hearing the continuous sound of rushing water, his ears seemed numb, and his head seemed dizzy. He walked forward step by step, increasing his pain. New cracks kept appearing under his feet, and he heard the ice blocks falling like thunder. In this dangerous environment, he was terrified. He barely escaped the last crack and collapsed, exhausted, on the grassy soil at the foot of the mountain on the other side.</p>
<p>In his confusion while crossing the glacier, he had already dropped his food basket. Now he had nothing to eat but to pick up pieces of broken ice and chew them. This way, he did not feel thirsty. After resting for a full hour, he barely regained his strength. Driven by greed, he hurried onward.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes about Orange Fun</h3>
<p>— Jun Mei</p>
<p>During the Qing Dynasty, the inner court had dedicated positions for various artisans. Recent people know only about the actors, but during the Qianlong and Jiaqing eras, after a long period of peace, specialized teams were established for all arts that could delight the heart and mind, and cultivate character. Famous masters were recruited and given honorary positions, not just limited to drama. As recorded in Qing Dynasty anecdotes: "During the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, court officials were fond of chess. Chess masters from all over gathered in the capital. Huang Longshi and Xu Xingyou were both appointed as inner court attendants." This shows that Xu was Huang's disciple. Huang was superior to Xu in age and skill, but Xu surpassed Huang in cunning and trickery. When they served in the inner court, Xu even managed to obtain an official position through this. The story is quite interesting. Xu cultivated connections with the inner eunuchs and knew everything that happened in the inner court in advance. One day, Xu visited Huang and said: "Your chess skills are truly superior to mine. However, you have won many games. How about you let me win by a small margin in front of the emperor, so I can save face for one day?" Huang smiled and agreed. When the time came, the emperor pointed to a gilded red box on the table and said: "Whoever wins will get what's inside." Huang thought it was a common reward. After the game, Huang lost. The emperor smiled and sighed, saying to Huang: "Although your chess skills are better than his, your fate is not as good as his!" He ordered the eunuch to open the box, and inside was a document appointing Xu as a prefect. Huang was stunned, watching Xu kowtow and express his thanks. Xu had already been informed by the eunuchs in advance, so Huang fell into his trap. Obtaining an official position through chess is indeed an interesting story.</p>
<p>After Xu, the most famous chess players were the "Four National Masters" Liang, Cheng, Shi, and Fan. During the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods, there were the so-called "Eighteen National Masters." At that time, the imperial court was in decline, and the customs were deteriorating. Those who called themselves "National Masters" all sought favor with powerful officials. Only Li Zhanyuan from Nantong and Zhou Xiaosong from Jiangdu did not follow the trend. Zhanyuan was one of the "Eighteen National Masters." He usually wore a turban and went barefoot, playing chess with princes and dignitaries without showing any weakness. Someone secretly tried to bribe him, but he remained the same, even shouting loudly: "I will not accept bribes, why do you offer this!" People could do nothing about it. Xiaosong once played chess with Zeng Xiangxiang. Zeng intended to give him a generous gift, but during the game, Xiaosong gave Zeng nine pieces, tearing his formation into nine pieces, barely surviving. Zeng was furious and refused to give him a single coin. There was a chess enthusiast whose skills were not very good. He suffered from scabies that never healed. When he was about to lose a game, he would lean half his body on the table, and the scabies would itch even more, filling the table with skin flakes, which disgusted everyone.</p>
<p>Chess can cultivate character, but it can also be detrimental to one's lifespan due to scheming and exhausting mental energy. Therefore, few chess enthusiasts live to a ripe old age. Monk Qiuhang, also a contemporary national master, was 119 years old in the Tongzhi Guihai year. He enjoyed the scenery of West Lake and traveled to Hangzhou with Chen Bomin from Jinling. In January of the following year, he suddenly bid farewell to his companions, saying he was returning west. His friends gave him a farewell feast on the day before the Lantern Festival. That day, they cheered and drank merrily, and he played chess with everyone. After the game, he put the pieces into the scale and said: "Today's gathering is hard to come by again, and this game is the best." The crowd did not understand, but he did not explain and left. The next day, it was reported that Qiuhang had passed away. For a chess master to reach the age of 120 is probably unprecedented, and to pass away immediately after finishing a game, is this not the Buddhist concept of "chess liberation" within "corpse liberation"?</p>
<h3>Errol Flynn's Gold Fever</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>Hollywood actresses are collectively known as "Gold Diggers," a well-known term. But recently, a "Gold Digger Hero" has emerged, that is Errol Flynn, the martial arts star famous for "The Charge of the Light Brigade," "The Adventures of Robin Hood," and "The Prince and the Pauper," who was recently elected as the Sixth Throne.</p>
<p>Although Errol Flynn has a penchant for gold digging, he has never succeeded. Each time he has lost a lot of money. The first time, someone suggested to him that there was a gold mine on the island of Alaska in the Pacific Ocean. The ore had already been discovered, but it lacked capital for further exploration. He was eager to try and provided that person with US$10,000 and an airplane worth US$7,000. Soon after, this person returned from the investigation, having used up all the money, and the gold mine had not been found. He had to take back the plane. But Errol Flynn was not discouraged. The second time, he traveled to a small island in Cuba, South America. He heard that pirates had once caused trouble on the island. Once, a group of pirates, pursued by warships, fled to the shore, hiding the loot of pearls and treasures together in a cannon barrel, sinking it to the bottom of the sea, and then ran away. He was fascinated by such a legendary story. With much effort, he begged for help from many Americans and spent US$2,000, finally retrieving the cannon from the seabed. However, all that was in the cannon barrel were worthless pebbles worth less than US$200.</p>
<p>Most recently, Errol Flynn heard that Oak Island had been a pirate hideout in ancient times. Valuables worth millions of dollars were buried in the seabed one hundred and several tens of feet deep. For one hundred and fifty years, many people have been developing it, but the pits are often flooded by seawater, and there have been no results. He wanted to make one last bet and was in contact with a cooperative enterprise in Canada to buy a piece of land and carry out development, attempting to realize his golden dream.</p>
<h3>Twenty Kinds of Ballads</h3>
<p>— Written by Dong Yun, illustrated by Xiu Yan</p>
<p>Fang Qing was a child of a noble family, but after being framed by treacherous officials, his family fortune declined! Furthermore, the magistrate of Xiangfu extorted grain, making the situation like a leaky house in the rain, with no peace anywhere! He and his mother went to Xiangyang to seek help from relatives. His aunt was snobbish and drove them away. Fortunately, his cousin was kind and encouraging, and before he left, she gave him a "Pearl Tower" as a "light refreshment." Three years later, he paid the price for his essays and his name was inscribed on the golden list! On the day of his triumphant return, he could not forget the hatred of the past, so he returned to Xiangyang and used Daoqing tunes to ridicule his aunt... Traditionally, the narration of the Pearl Tower ends here.</p>
<p>The Pearl Tower is one of the most successful ballad scripts.</p>
<h3>Unofficial History of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Yiyun</p>
<p>Eight Stable Boys of Green Stone Mountain</p>
<p>Green Stone Mountain was originally an auspicious martial arts drama. The leading roles were not very demanding, but it was good in that the sheng (male), dan (female), jing (painted-face male), and chou (clown) characters each had opportunities to show their strengths. It was truly a grand ensemble drama, so it felt very lively. One year, it happened that Xiao Lou came south, and also coincided with the Shanghai Five Troupe Grand Joint Charity Performance. At that time, several famous martial arts actors from the south were all in Shanghai, and the people assigning roles were really in a difficult position. So they came up with this "Complete Green Stone Mountain." Xiao Lou played Guan Ping, Yi Ganqi played the Nine-tailed Fox, Wang Yongli played Qu Cangzi, He Jinshou played Judge Wang, Yu Zhenting played Lu Zu, San Mazi played Guan Di, and Li Chunlai, Xia Yuerun, Zhao Ruquan, Gai Jiaotian, Zhao Xiaolian, Zhang Dejun, Ying Baolian, and Chen Junting, eight famous martial arts actors, played the eight stable boys. On the surface, it seemed to be supporting Xiao Lou, but in reality, it was still increasing the status of the Third Boss. Because the stable boys followed the Holy Emperor out onto the stage, and when Guan Gong came on stage, these eight brave, short-hitting martial arts actors flipped somersaults before and behind the horse, making the eyes of the audience below the stage dizzy. If the stage of the Grand Theater had not been large, these reckless men would almost have flipped off the stage. In terms of the age of these eight people, Chunlai was the oldest (if he were still alive today, he would be around eighty years old). Next was Zhao Junyu's father, Xiaolian, who is still alive today and is seventy years old this year. Next were Xia Laoba (Yuerun), Zhang Dejun, Gai Jiaotian, and Zhao Ruquan. At that time, Chen Junting and Ying Baolian were the youngest, but now they are all nearly sixty years old. Time flies, and in a blink of an eye, it has been thirty years. Those who once dominated the stage are now white-haired old men, or have already passed away, truly giving one a sense of the vicissitudes of life.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Weekly Supplement Cai Yuanpei Special Issue, No. 29</p>
<h3>Various Characteristics of Mr. Cai Yuanpei</h3>
<p>— Cai Shangsi</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Mr. Cai Jiemin passed away in Hong Kong on March 5th of this year! Because I often discussed academic matters with him after leaving Peking University, I know everything about him very well. The ancients considered establishing virtue, rendering meritorious service, and establishing words as the three imperishable achievements. Being able to achieve even one of them was considered difficult. Now, Mr. Cai excelled in all three, which is extremely rare in Chinese history. He is not only worthy of being called a "Grand Master of an Era." Now, I will try to briefly describe his various characteristics as a memorial and a cry!</p>
<p>Academic Aspect</p>
<p>Regarding this aspect, it is now divided into four points, described on the left:</p>
<p>(1) Progress of Thought – Mr. Cai's thought was very progressive. In politics, he advocated the best politics for the greatest number and the greatest happiness (see his "Opinions on Educational Policy"), applying the international mutual aid doctrine (see "The Great War and Philosophy"). In economics, he advocated distributing property and socialism (see the ethics section below). In education, he advocated aesthetic education (see "Record of Words and Deeds of Mr. Cai Jiemin"), and independent education free from political parties and churches (see "New Education," Vol. 4, No. 3 and "Chinese Educational Circles," Vol. 11, No. 10). In ethics, he advocated evolutionary cosmopolitanism (see "The World and Outlook on Life") and absolute egalitarianism between men and women in morality and sexuality (see "Record of Words and Deeds of Mr. Cai Jiemin, A Brief Biography"). As late as April of the 19th year of the Republic (1930), at a dinner party hosted by the Legislative Yuan inviting all members of the Third National Education Conference, he still advocated "the ideal new village abolishing surnames, marriage, and family" (see "Shen Bao" and other newspapers of the same month and 19th day). Mr. Cai, as a respected elder statesman of the Party and the nation, was still advancing in thought in his old age. This is something that those whose thoughts grow old with age and shift with position can never hope to achieve. It also shows that he has always stood at the forefront of the times and never wanted to lag behind. This precisely demonstrates his consistent spirit and thorough understanding.</p>
<p>(2) Breadth of Learning – Mr. Cai was a Jinshi and Hanlin scholar of the late Qing Dynasty, so he was proficient in Chinese literature, philosophy, and other disciplines. Later, he studied in Germany and France, researching Western philosophy, aesthetics, history, literature, education, etc., and was awarded a doctoral degree. Among the books he translated and authored, those related to philosophy, ethics, and literature are the most numerous, and they were mostly published by the Commercial Press. His essays are scattered in various newspapers and magazines, and in "Record of Words and Deeds of Mr. Cai Jiemin."</p>
<p>(3) Earnestness of Research – Mr. Cai was very earnest in his scholarship and had a spirit of skepticism. For example, in his "History of Chinese Ethics" written in the late Qing Dynasty, he already regarded Yao and Shun as ideal figures of Confucianism. Later, he put even more effort into writing "A Search for the Hidden Meaning of The Story of the Stone," and discovered that "the author held a very strong nationalism, the book's events mourn the fall of the Ming and expose the failures of the Qing, and especially express regret for the Han Chinese literati who served the Qing." Furthermore, Lin Shu, a literary giant of the conservative faction, wrote to Mr. Cai, saying about Peking University: "Recently, there have been those who attack the new morality, denouncing parents as being driven by carnal desires, with no gratitude owed to them. I once saw these words in the writings of Yuan Mei and thought them inappropriate, denouncing Yuan Mei as mad. I never imagined that there would be scholars who would use them for lectures, causing people's heads to ring and making arguments unworthy of debate, 'they can be ignored.'" Mr. Cai replied, saying that the kind of argument that "denounces parents as being driven by carnal desires, with no gratitude owed to them" came from the biography of Kong Rong in the "Book of the Later Han," a false accusation made by Lu Cui against Kong Rong, and not from Yuan Suiyuan. From this, it can be seen that Mr. Cai was not like Lin Qinnan, who casually cited things and recklessly scolded people! The study of learning by general old scholars often neglects methods; but Mr. Cai did not think so, and very accurately recognized that method is more important than concrete knowledge (see Mr. Cai's preface to Cai Shangsi's "Methods of Research on Chinese Thought").</p>
<p>(4) Fairness of Attitude – Mr. Cai was very humble towards friends and students who were younger than him. Scholars such as Hu Shi were valued by Mr. Cai, and he often "did not disdain to ask questions" of his own students. For example, in the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), when I was collecting "Historical Materials on China" in the Nanjing National Guoxue Library, I often went to the General Affairs Office of the Academia Sinica to see him. In order to be serious, he even asked me, "From which book and article do the words 'Your minister deserves to be punished, but the Heavenly King is wise' come from?" How humble this is! He was very concerned about the approximately three million words of "Historical Materials on Chinese Thought" that I had collected over the past ten years, and mentioned them frequently in letters after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War. Last year, after reading my book "Methods of Research on Chinese Thought," he also wrote to express his delight! My ability to make some contributions is largely due to Mr. Cai's encouragement. Furthermore, Mr. Liang Rengong's (Liang Qichao's) views and Mr. Cai's views were often very different, even opposite; but when Mr. Liang passed away, Mr. Cai, recognizing Mr. Liang's great contributions to scholarship, specifically proposed to the central government to issue an order of commendation (which was not adopted by the central government). This kind of selfless attitude is rare among contemporary scholars and important figures.</p>
<p>This is a treasured photograph of Mr. Cai from his early years. At that time, the Tokyo Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance) was established, and Mr. Cai was introduced to the Tongmenghui by Mr. He Haiqiao. Later, he was also introduced to the assassination squad. Assassination required bombs, and Mr. Cai believed that this matter should involve someone proficient in chemistry for better results, so he introduced Mr. Zhong Xian to the association. Mr. Zhong was proficient in chemistry and could purchase instruments and chemicals at the science instrument hall without arousing suspicion. After the bombs were made, the lack of bomb casings was a regret. By coincidence, Mr. Huang Keqiang (Huang Xing), Mr. Kuai Ruomu, and others arrived in Shanghai from Tokyo one after another, bringing bomb casings. Finding that they could not be manufactured, they rented a house to devise methods for improvement, and tested more than ten pieces through his younger brother Yuan, which were detonated by Mr. Sun Shaohou in a remote place in Nanjing. Later, Mr. Yang Dusheng's organization studied every morning and evening, hoping to make bomb casings. Mr. Sun was responsible for the expenses of the organization, while Mr. Cai and Mr. Kang were in charge of the organization. At that time, Mr. Cai also introduced many people from his hometown to the association. When Mr. Yang Dusheng went north, he met Mr. Wu Yue in Baoding and they became close friends at first sight, and he introduced him to the association. Soon after, the five ministers who went abroad to investigate constitutionalism encountered China's first bomb at the station. The bomber was Wu Yue, and Mr. Cai knew that the bomb must have been made by Mr. Yang, so he was afraid that he would not be able to leave Beijing. Mr. Sun Shaohou then went north on some pretext to rescue him from danger. When Mr. Cai served as the principal of the Patriotic Girls' School, he instilled new ideas into the women's world and patiently guided them. Mr. Lan Cai was one of the earliest people to advocate for women's rights.</p>
<p>Meritorious Deeds</p>
<p>Regarding this aspect, it is obvious to everyone, so there is no need for me to talk much about it. To mention the essentials, there are the following three points:</p>
<p>(1) Educational Achievements – Mr. Cai's education was most successful. This kind of achievement was first manifested in National Peking University and later in National Academia Sinica. When he was the president of Peking University, he purely embraced talentism in regards to faculty and staff, only asking about academic ability and not qualifications or age. From restoration party members to communists, all could be accommodated; from Chinese learning to Western learning, all should be emphasized... In regards to students, he emphasized free research and specialized research, striving to make each have their own strengths and be useful. As a result, Peking University students occupied important positions in all fields of politics and education across the country. Mr. Cai also integrated educational politics, using the school to supervise the government and leading faculty and students to engage in activities, which resulted in the greatest "May Fourth Movement" in Chinese history. The reason why Peking University was able to become the leading institution of learning in China was also due to the above points. In short: without Mr. Cai, Peking University would not have been so great; without the great Peking University, Chinese education and culture would not have been so impressive today. Mr. Cai later served as the president of the Academia Sinica, striving for scientific undertakings, which was also very related to the construction of the new China.</p>
<p>(2) Political Achievements – After the establishment of the Republic of China, Mr. Cai first served as the Minister of Education of the Provisional Government; after the success of the National Revolution, Mr. Cai also first served as the Minister of Education of the National Government (at that time renamed the University Council). During his tenure, he created and established many things, and he was truly worthy of being the sole leader of educational administration since the Republic of China. In addition, he also served as a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, a member of the National Government, a standing committee member, the President of the Control Yuan, and the Minister of Justice.</p>
<p>(3) Revolutionary Achievements – In the late Qing Dynasty, Mr. Cai and Zhang Taiyan, Wu Zhihui, and others ran newspapers to promote revolution and reject the Manchu Qing; later, he joined the Kuomintang to oppose the Northern Warlord government.</p>
<p>Personality Aspect</p>
<p>(1) Private Morality – Mr. Cai's life was very upright and simple. He did not have the common base hobbies; and in terms of housing, he never built a house of his own in a large city, which is the first point of difference from ordinary powerful people. Since the beginning of the Republic of China, although Mr. Cai has held important positions and his career has been quite smooth, he often resigned in anger for the sake of justice, or refused to take office in anger, which is the second point of difference from ordinary bureaucrats and politicians. Mr. Cai was very gentle and sincere, and would help as much as he could, responding to every request and not putting on airs, which is the third point of difference from ordinary people in positions of power. As for his selflessness, tolerance, generosity, and lack of sectarianism and emotional disputes, it has been briefly described in the above two sections on "Fairness of Attitude" and "Educational Achievements."</p>
<p>(2) Patriotism – Mr. Cai's revolutionary activities in the late Qing Dynasty and the May Fourth Movement were both motivated by patriotism. According to a report of Ren Hongjun's remarks, "The cause of this illness, although said to be old age and weakness, was mainly due to his concerns about national affairs... A few months ago, he still published a 'Manjianghong...Song,' expressing his deep love for the country in his words..." (See "Shen Bao," March 6).</p>
<p>(3) Human Rights – Mr. Cai was in the government, but his heart was with the people. Human rights were important, and personal gain was light. He was full of love for justice, upholding righteousness, and a spirit of fearlessness and willingness to sacrifice, which is truly immeasurable compared to those who aim to be officials and shift with their position!</p>
<h3>Mr. Cai's Last Words</h3>
<p>Human obligation is to seek what is universally ethical and not to think about oneself; to think of the future instead of the present; to seek spiritual joy and not bodily enjoyment.</p>
<p>In all things, action is better than empty talk, and great things must start from small things.</p>
<p>Replace improper entertainment with proper entertainment, so that morality is not corrupted and the body benefits.</p>
<p>If people can dispel superstition and uphold rational belief, they can save themselves from meaningless pursuits and hopes, and focus their efforts on undertakings that benefit society, and make progress every day.</p>
<p>People are born with strengths and weaknesses because of unequal self-defense abilities, and people are born with poverty and wealth because of unequal self-preservation abilities. With strength and weakness, poverty and wealth, the concept of difference between self and others arises. The weak and the poor suffer from insufficient happiness, and the consciousness of seeking arises. With the existence of self and others, there are various divisions in the phenomenon, which violate the entity. And seeking, when it is not achieved, is endless pain, and when it is achieved, it is excessive demand, circulating in the phenomenon and separated from the entity. If it can be balanced, then the enjoyment of the flesh is purely natural, and the pursuit of the conscious world is avoided, and the concept of self and others is also transformed.</p>
<p>A society, whether small as a family or a shop, or large as a country, must have each person in this society have a sense of common destiny with the society, and deeply understand the nature of this society, and each fulfill a common responsibility, so that no one is not constantly learning, and there is no time when one should not learn.</p>
<p>Never take past achievements as merit, nor need to make useless regret for past losses. Set your mind, focus on increasing knowledge, cultivating morality, and exercising your body. If you have free time, you can serve society, bear the responsibility of guiding the common people, and prepare to solve the great problems of China in the future—which cannot be solved now.</p>
<p>Our country has long been known to the world as a sick man. To revitalize it, it must be through ever-new ideas, popularized to everyone, rather than relying on the fierceness of a single hand or foot.</p>
<p>If you isolate yourself and operate alone, you may be frozen and hungry, and it may be difficult to avoid it. By combining the strength of people in the industry to operate, a happy life and a civilized undertaking can be discussed.</p>
<p>The trend of civil rights is like a river breaking its banks, surging and unstoppable.</p>
<p>When Mr. Cai was the supervisor of the Sino-Western School, his wife died. Matchmakers came one after another to arrange a marriage for Mr. Cai. Mr. Cai put forward five conditions: (1) The woman must not bind her feet. (2) She must be literate. (3) The man does not take concubines. (4) After the man dies, the woman can remarry. (5) If the couple do not get along, they can divorce. At that time, the thinking was rigid, and after seeing the last two conditions, everyone retreated. After a year, he married Ms. Huang Shizhen, the daughter of Mr. Huang Erxuan. At the wedding, instead of hanging a painting of the Three Stars, a red banner with the two large characters "Confucius" was used instead. The wedding chamber was replaced by a lecture. Later, Ms. Huang also passed away. Mr. Cai then married Ms. Zhou Yangjuan. This is a photo of Mr. Cai and Zhou Yangjuan at their wedding.</p>

<h3>Mr. Cai Jiemin</h3>
<p>— Gu Mei</p>
<p>——In Memory of a Pioneer of Social Education——</p>
<p>Since the news of Mr. Cai Jiemin's death spread, people at home and abroad have mourned in unison! Indeed, Mr. Cai has made many contributions to society, the country, education, and academia. Everyone mourns him, which is really an expression of commemorating his achievements. Standing in the position of social education, we feel even more that Mr. Cai is a pioneer of social education and needs to be deeply commemorated.</p>
<p>We see that China's social education has made considerable progress now, and when we think that there are still many undeveloped areas in China's social education, we feel that there is a need for a strong social education administrative agency to plan and promote it. And without knowing that when the Republic of China was established nineteen years ago, Mr. Cai had put a lot of effort into this point - firmly advocating the establishment of a Social Education Department in the Ministry of Education to be in charge of national social education administration.</p>
<p>During the Xinhai Revolution, Mr. Cai was still in Europe inspecting education. When he heard of the Wuchang Uprising, he returned to China immediately. When the Provisional Government of Nanjing was established, he took office as Minister of Education. Therefore, based on the results of his inspection abroad, he felt that the development of social education in various countries all relied on the power of educational administration to plan and promote it. Therefore, he firmly believed that the responsibility of educational administration was not only to educate young people within schools, but also to take into account the majority of older out-of-school adults. Therefore, when drafting the official system (the organizational law of the Ministry of Education), he firmly advocated the establishment of a Social Education Department in addition to the traditional General Education Department and Specialized Education Department, to be in charge of social education administrative affairs, in order to plan and promote national social education and correct the malpractices of the past lopsided development of education (especially focusing on school education). Later, although this system was partially revised by the Senate, it was generally passed, and a Social Education Department was established in the Ministry of Education to be specifically in charge of social education, which has been passed down to the present and can promote national social education and develop together with school education. This point is indeed Mr. Cai's contribution, and we cannot but remember him.</p>
<p>Naturally, we remember Mr. Cai's contribution to establishing the Social Education Department, not because he could "set up official positions and salaries" to support many section chiefs and clerks; but because there is a specialized social education administrative agency in charge, it can use administrative power to develop social education, so that millions of people across the country who do not have the opportunity to go to school can receive a little education, especially out-of-school adult civilians. For example, the implementation of remedial education for out-of-school adult civilians in various provinces and cities in recent years has been entirely driven by the Social Education Department; the most obvious is that planning, raising funds, training personnel, supervision, and guidance all rely on the power of the social education administrative agency to be carried out. And the creation of this administrative agency is Mr. Cai's contribution.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Cai also made great contributions to the language reform of the people. For example, the phonetic alphabet in the early Republic of China, the national language research in the sixth year of the Republic of China, and the national language Romanization in the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, he has done his best to gradually reform the language of the people to the point where it is easy to learn. This point is also a major issue in China's social education, and Mr. Cai has already paid attention to it and tried his best to find ways to reform it.</p>
<p>Mr. Cai has made the same contributions to Chinese social education, so after the establishment of the Chinese Social Education Society in the twentieth year of the Republic of China, he was recommended as an honorary director, expressing his contribution to social education. Now that Mr. Cai has passed away, we colleagues in the social education field should have a deeper level of commemoration.</p>
<h3>Mr. Cai Jiemin and Peking University</h3>
<p>— Qiao</p>
<p>Mr. Cai's relationship with Peking University began in the fifth year of the Republic of China. At that time, Mr. Cai was still in France, and was summoned back to China by the Ministry of Education to serve as the president of Peking University. Because the public opinion of Peking University at that time was really too bad, and the internal situation was really too corrupt, it was impossible without Mr. Cai coming back to rectify it. At the same time, Mr. Cai also agreed to take on this important task despite the difficulties and hardships. And he hired Mr. Chen Zhongfu (Duxiu) as the dean of the Faculty of Arts, Mr. Xia Fuyun as the dean of the Faculty of Science, and Mr. Shen Yinmo, Mr. Liu Bannong and others as professors.</p>
<p>The first thing Mr. Cai did at Peking University was to "reform students' concepts," because Peking University students had always been accustomed to not having any interest in learning. They only waited until the school years were over to get a graduation diploma, and especially focused on the career prospects after graduation. This was of course a huge mistake, so when Mr. Cai gave his first speech at the school, he explained: "University students should regard academic research as their vocation, and should not regard the university as a ladder to promotion and wealth."</p>
<p>Peking University was originally established with five departments: arts, science, engineering, law, and commerce. At that time, Peiyang University also had engineering and law departments. In addition, there was also a national industrial vocational school in Beijing. Mr. Cai believed that there was no need for this duplication, so he advocated that the engineering department of Peking University be merged into Peiyang, and the law department of Peiyang be discontinued immediately. Later, after several discussions, with the consent of the president of Peiyang University and the approval of the Ministry of Education, the civil engineering and mining engineering departments of Peking University were merged into Peiyang University.</p>
<p>Mr. Cai once said: "Students in school should take learning as their greatest purpose and should not have any political organizations. Those who are twenty years old or older and have a special interest in politics can participate in political groups in their individual capacity without involving the school." So indeed, on May 4th of the eighth year of the Republic of China, Beijing students had the idea of not signing the Treaty of Paris and dismissing the pro-Japanese faction Cao, Lu, and Zhang, which led to the May Fourth Student Movement known throughout the country. At that time, Mr. Cai resigned because he was suspected of maintaining the status of the students in the movement. However, after the May Fourth Movement was completed and everything had subsided, only the issue of the resignation of the president of Peking University caused disputes again. After several months of back and forth, although the government appointed Mr. Hu Cishan as the successor, he was opposed by the students, and as a result, Mr. Cai agreed to resume his post, and the dispute was resolved.</p>
<p>Another thing that Mr. Cai did at Peking University that opened a new era in academia was coeducation; Mr. Cai advocated equality between men and women; in the ninth year of the Republic of China, female students requested to enter the school, so Peking University officially recruited female students during the summer vacation. Immediately afterwards, many people asked Mr. Cai: "Coeducation is a new method, why didn't you ask the Ministry of Education for approval first?" Mr. Cai replied: "The Ministry of Education does not have a special regulation for universities to only enroll male students. In the past, female students did not request to enroll, so there were no female students. Now that female students have requested to enter the school, and their level is not weaker than that of male students, the university has no reason to refuse." The trend of coeducation began at that time.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Mr. Cai Jiemin</h3>
<p>— Mi Ruozhuo</p>
<p>In the late Qing Dynasty, Mr. Cai followed the Premier, traveled around the world, promoted revolution, and organized the Restoration Society with Xu Xilin, Zhang Taiyan, Qiu Jin, and others, and set the slogan: "The source of the Yellow River traces the Zhejiang tide, defend our Chinese Han people, do not let the Manchu Hu leave a piece of armor, the descendants of Xuanyuan are the pride of heaven." In the first year of the Republic of China, the revolution was successful, and Mr. Cai served as the Minister of Education, and was especially valued by people at the time. Officials and others came to pay their respects and congratulations; there were several congratulatory guests dressed in smart formal wear, just about to enter the door to congratulate, when they saw Mr. Cai come out to greet them. Mr. Cai himself was wearing a short coat, and both hands were stained with soap foam, wiping as he greeted them. At this time, the congratulatory guests felt quite embarrassed, with embarrassment all over their faces. Mr. Cai had already understood and said, "It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, thank you all, please sit inside; I have nothing to do, so I'm just doing old things again and casually washing clothes (because Mr. Cai washed his own clothes when he was studying), but it's hard for you all." Seeing this, we could not help but immediately think of Mr. Cai's often said phrase "Labor is sacred."</p>
<p>The communication between the battlefields is smooth.</p>
<h3>An Unusual Army on the Hangping Road: The Economic Anti-Blockade Patrol</h3>
<p>— Ye Zhou</p>
<p>I initially discovered this "unusual army" between the Huangwanjiao and Liyan areas along the Hangping Highway, arousing my suspicion: Could it be a "regular army?" No, a regular army should have a well-organized appearance! Could it be a "guerrilla force?" Again, no, they didn't seem accustomed to "fighting in battle!" Perhaps it was a "Youth Corps" or "Boy Scouts?" But I immediately noticed that it consisted of both old and young!</p>
<p>Driven by my suspicion, I chased this "unusual army," passing the former site of Huangwan Elementary School, past the silk factory, cutting through the outskirts of Huangwan Town, and traveling more than a mile at a brisk pace. When they stopped at the salt fields by the Huangwan coast, I stopped as well. I saw a large flag planted in the damp salt mud, bearing the words: "Economic Anti-Blockade Patrol," and a smaller line of text beside it: "Zhexi Eleventh Detachment, Fifth Squad."</p>
<p>I quietly greeted a kind-looking young man and asked in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Does this patrol team come often?"</p>
<p>He looked at me with suspicion and was unwilling to answer. I quickly declared, "Please rest assured! I am from this area myself and have only recently returned from Shanghai, so I am completely ignorant of everything happening in my hometown!" I spoke entirely in the Haining dialect.</p>
<p>He nodded and first asked me, "Do you know Mr. Zhang ×× of Huangwan Town?"</p>
<p>How could I not know him? You can ask around; he has always been a friend of mine.</p>
<p>"In that case, I'll tell you!" he said cautiously, "They come often, but it's not always the Fifth Squad that comes to Huangwan. I think it must be an organizational designation that is not limited to a specific area!"</p>
<p>Hearing him use terms like "designation" and "area," I couldn't help but ask with delight, "You must have attended middle school?" He first inquired about my name and then immediately said with a smile, "I knew your name long ago! My own name is Gu ××, and I studied at Haining County Middle School for over a year, but I didn't graduate."</p>
<p>I quickly said, "Could you tell me about the general situation of this patrol team?"</p>
<p>"Why not!" He pointed to a nearby salt kiln and said, "Let's go sit down and talk!"</p>
<p>Because I planned to rush back to Jiaoliyan in the morning, I urged him to tell me quickly. He reported to me in an orderly manner:</p>
<p>'After a portion of our Western Zhejiang fell, the Zhejiang Provincial Government immediately issued an order to all subordinate counties to organize "Economic Anti-Blockade Patrols." In the un-occupied counties, areas were divided and "Detachments" were established. Under the detachments were "Squads," and the general headquarters was located in Yuqian.</p>
<p>'Their mission is to thwart the Japanese economic blockade plot, prevent the secret transport of domestic resources into the "occupied areas" to be exploited by others, and also prevent inferior goods from the "occupied areas" from leaking into the interior market to be sold. Like the former "anti-smuggling teams" cracking down on "private salt," they patrol all the coastal defenses all day long to prevent any "leakage." When necessary, they need to use "armed suppression," so they also have "guns!"</p>
<p>'Their predecessors included reorganized anti-smuggling teams and reorganized defense corps, but most of them were ambitious young people and strong men who joined voluntarily. Therefore, there are quite a few "intellectuals" in these teams!</p>
<p>"Now, this movement has spread to all the occupied counties in our Western Zhejiang. In Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Pinghu, I heard that detachment headquarters have been established. Think about it, this team is the "Zhexi Twelfth Detachment, Fifth Squad." Presumably, the "guerrilla areas" in Western Zhejiang are a mix of loyalists and traitors, and the situation is more complicated, so several more detachment headquarters had to be established. Our Western Zhejiang has only "fallen" for fourteen counties and one city, so it seems that each county has a detachment headquarters! Or perhaps both our Haining County and the nearby Haiyan County have their respective detachment headquarters. Unfortunately, I rarely go out, so I cannot tell Mr. Zhang the details! But one detachment already has five squads, and I'm afraid there are more than that. With twenty people per squad, the strength of this patrol team is indeed considerable!"</p>
<p>I was extraordinarily pleased with this young man's articulate speech and analytical answers, which were invaluable. I asked again, "So, what happens to the seized smuggled goods and inferior goods?" He answered me succinctly, "Confiscated."</p>
<p>Before parting, I wanted to ask him why he dropped out of school. He sighed and said, "I have been out of school for many years! It has nothing to do with this war of resistance, but rather with the unbearable burden of family finances..."</p>
<p>On the way back, I kept thinking about this "Economic Anti-Blockade Patrol," and also about this sincere and lovely "promising young man."</p>
<h3>New Dodge Cars Arriving in Shanghai Soon in Second Batch</h3>
