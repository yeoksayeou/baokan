<h3>世界當前之敎訓與前途</h3>
<p>茲請三論芬蘭與蘇聯事，尤願爲英法美蘇諸國人士，略陳所懷。</p>
<p>芬蘭接受蘇聯之提議，放棄抗戰，割地媾和，此所刺激世界輿情者，反應逈殊，而强烈幾臻極度則一。蘇聯意得志滿，芬蘭悲憤沉痛，德國在歡，義國忻慰，瑞典挪威則慚恧喜懼，英法悔而思奮，美人惋惜慨歎而不掩其驚愕。誠以問題複雜，影響宏遠，觀察旣異其方面，估量復異其角度，所得所感，宜若是之不同格也。鑒此同問題不同觀感，尤兒國際事件不容輕率衡量；衡量之以是非，不腐迂乎？衡量之以利害，不褊私乎？衡量之以情感，不膚淺乎？衡量之以現實，不隘狹乎？不助暴而逢惡乎？衡量之以高尙卓帶之理想，不扞格迂緩，無裨大局乎？任執其一而衡量之，自成一家言，顧豈定論哉！</p>
<p>以論芬穌，蘇聯對芬蘭，遠自去秋，相繼發動其外交攻勢與軍事攻勢；此何性質，是何意熊？及其荏苒漸得天時，轉戰漸制地利，則又自闢談判途徑而謀和；雖所取於芬蘭者甚肥，然據瑞典外交部長龔德氏宣稱，妥協條件已視初由瑞典轉達者爲溫和；是折衝之際，蘇聯固猶留芬蘭盤旋餘地，而從違之問，固對待芬蘭爲獨立自由之國家而由芬蘭政府當局斟酌抉擇者也。夫當初之性質意態，世論甚尠寬恕；最後之主動轉圜，世論亦可指摘；然假定蘇聯不、若是而決心覆亡芬蘭，蓄意擴大歐戰，此其假定之後果，又將何如？此則絕無客觀事實足爲假定前提之論證，亦即無可斷言而大可深長思者也。對此情狀，竊以爲各國對於蘇聯，應作兩種判斷；其一，由芬蘭合法政府之簽字於和約，斯在法理上事實上應承認蘇聯成功；其二，由蘇聯對芬蘭之轉圜，斯在心理上實際政策上應承認蘇聯非無妥協性。如此判斷，或足爲圖謀　定國際之重要因素。</p>
<p>芬蘭政府之簽訂和約、其苦悶，其委屈，自必人人予以無匕同情；而其百餘日來之忠勇抗戰。竟結束於此慘痛條件之下，則不但所謂「非戰之罪，』實已以壯烈之戰績，克保國族之獨立自由。蓋自始不抗戰則政治上必已淪爲蘇聯之附庸；抗戰而一敗塗地則根本上必已玉石俱焚，捷克波蘭，皆殷鑒也。若擯捷克波蘭於不談，取法乎上，與中國並論之，芬蘭自是大異於中國；芬蘭國族之各種客觀條件，先天條件，絕無抗蘇而自力制勝之可能；故中國有此自信則戰，芬蘭作此自信則妄；此其異一。中國期待友邦者，在精神上物質上之援助，雖所獲援助猶憾其菲，然已有裨於抗戰；芬蘭於精神物質而外，猶望軍事人力之外援，顧乃杯水車薪，緩不濟急；此其異二。日本對中國，志在呑，其勢乃類於蛇呑象；蘇聯對芬蘭，以和的證其志不在吞，藉日不足爲證。其勢乃類於象吞蛇；此其異三。異不祗此，即此三端，雖在贊成中國抗戰者，亦澈底理解芬蘭之放棄抗戰而忍痛割地媾和。世論有爲芬蘭抗戰之半途而廢惜者、將何殊於隔岸觀火。世論有謂芬蘭自此陷於蘇聯掌握者，則猶視蘇聯如何政策，猶視芬蘭如何自處，猶視芬蘭之環境與世局之演變；居今日而遽視芬蘭爲喪其獨立自由，或出惡意，或出神經過敏之悲觀，非確論也。</p>
<p>由芬蘭兩國以息戰媾和結束當世三大事件之一，此就局部觀之，由動歸靜，由變態歸常態。然其影響所及，務必視此爲對於世界大局之强有力之推動。經此推動，世界大局將向何方開展，尙難逆覩；苦竟因此而同時向多方面開展，甚至作可驚可駭或可欣喜之開展，要之，絕非異數。吾人茲不必假定何種開展之方面而試加議論，然取芬蘇問題中之若干敎訓，置之目前，銘之心頭，則深信必有裨於對付開展中之世界大局。敎訓維何？其間最可注意者；（一）國際聯盟非經改組與充實，則絕無用處；當芬蘭糾紛之初，國聯集曾對付，中國雖棄權，然贊成開除蘇聯會籍，援助芬蘭抵抗者數十國；然於蘇何損，於芬何益，於國職徒以自暴其有待改組充實。（二）英法美諸國之威信，雖本質無虧，自信甚强，然其客觀估價已一落千丈；故英法美所欲喝退者，未能令人止步，欲令人止步，必須自行前進數步。（三）予人援助，必視其需，必如其量，必協其時；若需血而予以鐵，需鐵而予以麥，需麥而予以鈔票，非無益，但無功；若需一百而予以九十九，亦將功虧一簣；若需今日而期以來茲，則憑弔之小及。（四）精神物質不可分，芬蘭在精神一端，無論國內，無論國際，豈更有絲毫遺憾，而卒不得不委屈於物質力量之下而更犧牲物質；昨令法論者，謂芬蘭之不戰，影響英法精神者多，影響物質者少，此非不思之甚，即欺人之談；芬蘭幸而不亡，若小幸而亡，則其民族精神亦足以彪炳千古，誰得而否認之，然而何益。（五）戰時祗有以軍事促進外交之功能，不能以外交補益軍事之不足；迷信外交，依恃外交者，至少在外交方面歸於失敗；英法對芬蘭，外交上並無遺憾，但因無軍事而外交無益，對於瑞典挪威，以外交失敗而幷礙及軍事。（六）英法對捷克波蘭之投資與援助，至少在目則已化爲烏有，然對芬蘭之債權依然存在，對中國之權益依然存在，此無他，抗戰之力也；波蘭敗亡而東歐局變，芬蘭屈服而北歐局變，惟東亞危局猶能支撑，此無他，抗戰之力也；中國決不抹煞美蘇英法援助之有裨於抗戰，然從事實敎訓，必須認明此非諸國援華之效，實係中國抗日之功；抗者不抗則援者徒援，抗者終於敗北則援者盡付東流。</p>
<p>凡此若干敎訓，願英法人士熟思之，願美國人士熟思之，蘇聯對華爲至友，請以躬親體騐所得而更爲遠東熟思之。應如何對付世界待決而未決之問題乎？尤願各國人士熟思者：安定國際之道，非各方各有所懸擬或所共認之若干原則乎？今不合原則之變故，踵接而來；且敗者敗，亡者亡，屈者屈，更經歲月，彼以不合原則而收穫者，且將所穫經營之矣，消化之矣；幸而遠東迄今猶有中國强毅抗戰，不然稍經歲月，原則雖從容戰勝，世局已成何種局面耶？及今不亟盡全力協謀應付，乃待他年陳屍而逐一使之返魂，是又何計算耶？</p>

<h3>朱家驊論歐戰　對華並無不利　中國外交運用游刃有餘　且負世界和平重要使命</h3>
<p>（重慶通訊）中央黨部組織部長朱家驊博士、現任國聯同志會中國分會副會長、對國際問題極有硏究、最近應重慶大學之請、作關於「歐戰觀感」之演說、朱氏用統計數字推論歐戰前途、其結論中並闡述歐戰對華並無不利、其全文極精警、並曾由朱氏親加校閱、實爲關心世界大局者亟應注意者也、茲錄原文如下、</p>
<p>一，戰爭的由來</p>
<p>歐戰發生以來、前綫雖只有斥堠活動、形成一種膠着狀態、但就趨勢去看、不論斡旋和平的各方面怎樣努力、歐洲的和戰問題、一時尙雜見分曉、</p>
<p>上次世界大戰、交戰國共犧牲了將近二千萬人的生命及無量數的金錢、纔換得那一部凡爾賽條約、痛定思痛的歐洲人、對於這費了偌大代價得來的和約、自楚極端珍視、歐洲的政治家一面要維待和約、一面又要避免以和約爲出發點而頻發的不幸事件、眞算是熬費苦心了、然而歷盡千辛萬苦獲致的凡爾賽條約、對於大家所仰慕的和平、僅僅勉强的支持了二十年、便又把厭戰的歐洲人民投進戰爭之神的懷抱去了、</p>
<p>上次大戰之所以發生、是由於各國國策受了生產澎漲的影響、羣起而爭奪殖民地、原料與市塲、普魯士的名軍事學家、穿勞什維茲Ciavswitz曾說過「戰爭是政治的繼續、」那是歐洲各國政治的演進、已到了無可再進的境地、所以不惜以戰爭濟政治之窮、演成了歷史上空前未有的慘劇、而一九一九年大家聚在凡爾賽的時候、又各懷着對未來的恐懼心理、以爲只要束縛了戰敗國、使其無法報復則未來戰禍便可免除、故對於一九一四年戰爭爆發的根由、沒有澈底檢討、沒有設法泯除、以致凡爾賽條約不能把永久和平的基礎建立起來、且因戰後的政治家、其觀點仍不脫舊日窠曰、不求改絃更張、所以對於新的問題、不採探新的意見、去尋求解決、</p>
<p>所謂新的問題、便是隨着戰後的復興與繁榮而生產愈益過剩的問題、所謂新的尊見、便是拋開了資源與市塲的爭奪、而本着國際技術合作的精神、協力開發尙未開發的地方、以吸收並解決一切的過剩、這個是我們總理孫先生當初的建議、孫先生在「實業計劃」中說、「近時世界戰爭、已證明人類之於戰爭、不論或勝或負、均受其殃、而始禍者受害彌重、此埋於以武力戰者固眞、於以貿易爭者尤確也、威爾遜總統、今旣以國際聯盟防止將來　的武力戰爭、吾更欲以國際共助中國之發展、以免將來之貿易戰爭、則將來戰爭之最大原因，庶可從根本絕去矣、」這種至理名言、對世界和平的良好貢獻、中國是一貫地信奉着、去年五中全會宜言更從新予以闡明、不幸聽者藐藐、二十年來、歐洲的政治家未能重視、以致歐洲重蹈前轍、再以兵戎相見、</p>
<p>二，戰略</p>
<p>這次歐戰開端、有些人因爲過於估計科學利器的威力、以爲交戰國一經接觸、必立刻會有很劇烈的大會戰、並以爲歐洲的文化必隨之毀滅、但實際上並不如此、六個月來的事實吿訴我們、交戰國雙方所採取的戰略、都是消耗戰略、而不是速戰速決的殲滅戰略、最足令我們注意的、是他們側重於海戰和空戰、在陸地上墊伏不動、道算是在戰史上創了一個新的紀錄、從開戰到現在、可以說是「西綫無戰事」沒有陣地戰、更說不上總攻擊的主力戰、</p>
<p>然則交戰國雙方這次所採取的消耗戰略爲什麽比上次戰爭下半期所採取的更爲澈底呢、這自然要推源於上次大戰所賜予的敎訓、人們知道上次德國之所以失敗、乃由於經濟力的不足、克勞什維茲又說過、「戰爭是用別一種工具表演出來的政治上的把戲」、時至今日、我們也許可以說「戰爭是武器的經濟角逐」、因之、如果我們要了解交戰國雙方的戰略、藉以推測這次戰爭的出路、那麽、我們應該從分析各交戰國的經濟現狀入手、方不致離事實太遠、（未完）</p>

<p>米業市塲監督甚嚴</p>

<h3>工部局財務處長談　加捐勢難中止　竟以嘉惠華人種種為言　對市民能否負担責不論</h3>
<p>工部局財務處處長毛爾濟、昨在都城飯店扶輪社發表談話、略謂、日前各界對工部局增加市政捐　決議、表示反對、實未會知悉各界近年來對於工部局各種要求之增多、工部局年來對本埠華人及日人特備之</p>
<p>各種措施不可勝計、而此此決定於七月一日起增加市政捐百分之五十、反對最力者、蹶惟華人與日人、實使渠不易了解、毛爾濟氏繼又稱、當中國政府撤離上海時、工部局曾代為收容各監獄中之囚犯、而對於華人教育之種種施備、亦多不勝舉、以目前兩租界市政捐政策而論、確有分別、蓋工部局所採取用者、乃所謂「殖民地之分頭政體」、而法公董局　採用者、則為完全之「民主政體」也、以本年度預算而論、公共租界之支出、因上述要求而增加、共計七百萬元、其中三百十五萬七千一百九十元、用於教育事業二百七十二萬二千一百九十元、用於監獄方面、一百十九萬　千四百三十元、用於商團、至於法租界方面、對此種用度、則大為減少耳、如另將救火會及巡捕房之一切費用、加於其內、則其數當更為浩大、</p>

<h3>郵局劃入警戒區　公衆極感不便　裝載郵件車輛竟不能過橋　包裹刷印已打算遷地為良</h3>
<p>上海郵　管理局大　、自　日方劃入虹口警戒區域以後、公衆赴該局投寄郵件、蒙受精神上之痛苦與行動之不便、茲探錄各情如次、</p>
<p>公衆不便殊極　自日方以「租界部隊指揮部」名義、　將北　西路至自來水橋堍之　絲網伸展、至循北蘇州河路　四川路橋北堍郵政管理局之　道遽被　斷、前往該局者、均須繞道四川路橋、其予投寄、郵件公衆之不便、至為　刻、</p>
<p>交涉毫無結果　上項事件發生後、雖經上海郵務長　配林特派日籍副郵務長金指　一郎、向日領署及其他有關方面交涉、惟日方竟以蘇州河北、西起於北河南路為其防區為藉口、毫無結果、</p>
<p>須經日軍崗哨　因郵局大廈之被劃入警戒區而引起公衆不便、其顯著者、除赴管理局投寄郵件、均須經日兵崗哨前面外、包裹刷印品等重件、須藉車輛裝載者、則概須繞行乍浦路橋、</p>

<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸五百零五元、迨至十時半掛大五元、下午三時又高五元、傍晚四時十五分再大五元、結果大同行改懸五百二十元、爲有市以來之空前新紀錄、新同行與上價相同、收進約減低十五元光景、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米操縱已食報　一號西貢僅開四十二元半　操縱囤戶想不到如此慘跌　兩旬之間竟跌去十元之鉅</h3>
<p>國米粳糯來源、昨由虹口轉出者、續有汽車十二輛、數計六百餘包、粳米塲外暗盤、聞更淸淡、做開極稀、行情落低元許、糧米去路亦然寥落、且以新到貨頗旺、人心尤虛、致價高貨貶短一元、中次者竟削一元半光景、各色織米、自前市先緊後疲、昨則人心愈頹、洋行家仍在廉價兜售、致原根客販及浮囤散戶、隨之脫手、市面愈跌愈呆、實爲今庚所米有、致全市交易竟似無形停頓、直至收市未稍轉色、統計各貨行情、無論西貢小絞較前市均續暴瀉元半至二元之巨、若一號西貢收盤已僅四十二元半、火絞四十一元、小絞三十八元、二號暹羅三十八元、混合碎三十四元至三十三元、回顧此次米價暴跌、以當時一號西貢最高價五十二元而論、在二旬之間、計先後猛落十元之巨、且今四十二元半之一號西貢價、已跌破去年收盤四十三元之行情、其他如火絞等貨、悉屬如是、此爲米業所不及料、更爲一般專事投機操縱之浮囤散戶想不及、而爲平民吃戶所欣慰者也、</p>
<p>洋米昨日躉售市况繼續瀉跌、晨間開市一度因金價上漲、定價高昂、貨方意圖支撑、奈何途貨到源絡繹不絕、一般浮戶被銀根緊壓、不得不貶價求脫、一號西貢三月期開價五十二元、後即降至五十一元三角、午後五十一元而無進戶問訊、二號開四十七元半、小絞開四十八元三五角、後市均疲而乏交、而二號現貨原包同自四十六元半開價小至四十六元、小絞現貨原包亦小至四十七元、比之前日又小近元至一元五六角不等、然人心虛軟、市形尙未站定、而浮戶手貨仍有急急求售之模樣云、</p>
<p>洋米續到三萬餘包、法輪霞飛號、自西貢裝來三萬餘包、又怡和洋行永生輪、自香港運來一千六百十七包、昨已起卸完竣、聞永生輪船內尙有運往烟台之洋米一千七十七包、運津洋米九百九十四包、定明日原船運往烟津、（祖）</p>
<h3>客銷不振　回籠粉價復鬆</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨市復見鬆濫、查回籠貨市面自出口禁令撤銷後、連日步緊、惟出口方面雖未阻禁、而北洋幫以天津物價大跌、進胃依然不振、兼之申市米價一再低落、人心未免餒弱、聞綠砲車牌喊價尙須十五元、但無受主、老車牌初開十四元五角、旋即鬆至十四元四角三分、後市開過十四元四角、亦祇內地鄕幫零星點綴、市面變化、或將待諸平賣期滿、聞維持粉到期後、廠盤必將增加云、</p>
<p>小麥　昨市亦覺平淡、蘇州麥經前日開至二十五元後、購方相繼嫌昂、而貨方以存到兩缺、在洋麥未到以前、莫不一味扳守、上午未有成交、聞後市祇開蘇州麥一票、價爲二十四元七角五分、比前降小二角半云、</p>
<h3>證劵　傳英繼美援華　公債人心興奮</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、咋市因傳英國擬繼美之後、自動的對華援助、國際形勢尙佳、人心乃不因美匯猛縮及金號在漲而起反映、市氣忽轉興奮、拍價一致回高、有無繼續能力、但看事實如何、依環境形勢觀察、公債不致過軟、昨日上午因一時人心轉變、市價冉冉上升、丙種再穿出八九關、聯和稍有補進、永康·泰豐·仁昌·及六十四號均有需要、惟胡鶴記·益大·及二十五號仍在放出、午後協大·生大·久豐·聯益·均有賣出、永康續有補回、四號十六號及天生亦有買進、市價售升五分一角、結果已比昨日回高二角半至四角、成交總數約計七十餘萬元、茲錄簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交冠生園五十股、價爲二十五元正、　昨衆業公所股市、開盤尙穩、嗣因浮多出籠稍切、價格略有跌落、成交額不大、橡皮股不因匯市緊俏而被打破沉悶局面、</p>
<p>倫敦十三日（週三）電、今日中國外債掛牌行市、仍吿平穩、上下檔各債券概無變動、</p>

<h3>紗花　棉紗廠盤　改售現鈔　漲時雖有回出　人氣仍屬堅昂</h3>
<p>紗市盤旋續漲、趨勢甚昂、此因美匯步縮、黃金飛騰、人心提高、撳起買風、但有一部份因其底盤已高、稍有傾向賣出、故在漲風劇烈時、復來吐出、惟廠家開售之價、旣屬奇昂、且均改現鈔、因此大戶購買旺盛、市盤趨勢、依然向榮、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、因海外棉市均落、人氣稍鬆、而獲利多頭出籠、市象略疲、二十支雙馬三月份價爲九百七十元、少頃直跌至九百六十三元、旋聞外匯又見改縮、空氣漸盛、且有大戶拖進、市價徐徐向升、至九百八十一元、查半日間成交統計二千〇四十三包、行情廿支雙馬現貨漲十六元、十五日棉紗運香港四十五件、運厦門一百五十五件、茲將各幫口買去之額量分列如左、同行　一、八六三　香港　一六〇福州　一〇　內地　一〇統計　二、〇四三</p>
<h3>棉市清淡　美棉雖小　廠需不健</h3>
<p>本棉交易、已較清淡、實因印棉平平、英滙不縮、故心思稍淡、然購訂價格、依然高昂、且美滙狂縮、四二支原料大貴、廠方申新納胃較健、但無次量額子、可供搜羅、故市面安定、蘇北來源、到通花一千一百零六包、茲將現棉情形如左、平果爾　一八六·〇〇　同行進　九〇〇件北太倉　草包　二〇七·五〇　又　二六〇包又　二〇四·〇〇　又　二〇〇包烏江花　二三九·〇〇　申新進　一、〇〇〇擔通打包　二一三·〇〇　同行進　二〇〇件</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日晨初先因利物浦來電報吿低落、而價下沉、嗣後又因大衆賣出、及一部份多頭了結、再見下跌、尤以遠期爲最、結果收盤價格近期跌十餘磅音、遠期降落二十二磅音、印度運同預測又跌八羅比、埃及漲跌俱見、</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉交易、日來因英美匯兌之緊縮、美匯已縮至六元三七五、美棉昨日雖跌廿餘磅音、折合棉價無甚軒輊、然人心已不若前數日之堅定、故交易頗爲靜寂、廠方已不欲開出新紗、故始終未曾動辦、茲將昨日棉市以美匯六元三七五折合送廠價如下、二十支美米特林　二七九·五〇又又　下級　二六九·六〇三十二支　又　二九三·〇〇又又　下級　二八二·〇〇四十二支　又　二九五·〇〇又又　下級　二八五·六〇</p>
<h3>疋頭　本客旺辦　棉布續昂</h3>
<p>布市繼續　漲、乃繳本街及浙閩粵各帮裏銷旺盛、業　報縮、業內外　興做多之念，售盤粗布細布漲二角半至五角、細斜漲　角、綸昌怡和等廠漂染印花布加起五角至一元半、本街成交達千餘件、浙東溫甬帮辦粗布·漂布·色布等五百餘件，閩粵帮亦各辦一百餘件，</p>
<p>東布本街交易旺盛、白貨細布·細斜·每疋續漲三四角、色貨嗶嘰每碼漲一分、惟龍頭細布之廠棧單、凡去年份貨在三月未出消者、四月每件棧租須徵收十元、因此有新舊棧單之分別、每疋售價相差一角半至二角、故昨收堅時、龍頭老棧單爲二十八元二角、而新棧單須二十八元三角半、四君子嗶嘰現出已增至八角四分七五、本月期尤昂、已售開八角六分、十四日疋頭運香港四十七件、運海防二百八十件、十五日運香港九件、</p>
<h3>糖市　荷赤開三千包</h3>

<h3>油市　價格太昂　生豆油不易動銷</h3>
<p>豆油及花生油市、近日無甚發展、其起伏範圍祗元譜上落、總之價格昂貴、流動籌碼有尾大不掉之感、故賣買均呆、漲跌亦微、惟近日交易略呈熱鬧、行情在兩日來漲起二元之譜、但銷塲祗本街行囤胃口、昨統市做開大連豆油二百三十桶、價自一百十六元五角至一百十七元、常州來豆油二十桶、價為一百十五元、漢口來豆油二十桶、價爲一百十二元、蚌埠來豆油五十桶、價爲一百十二元、江北豆油十桶、價爲一百十五元、大有廠豆油一百担、價爲九十一元、烟歧豆油三百件、價爲八十二元、靑島花生油二十桶、價爲一百十四元、江北生油三十桶、價爲一百十二元至一百十二元五角、烟台生油六百聽、價爲一百零四元五角、</p>

<h3>開壩</h3>
<p>運河下游五壩：曰車邏，曰南關，曰新壩，曰中壩，曰昭關；惟昭關在甘泉境，餘四壩皆屬高郵。同治五年患水，啟壩稍遲，遂致淸水潭隄決。嗣經吳漕帥奏定限制，啟閉得時，故歷年來，得不釀成巨禍。計每年秋前定限，水高一丈四尺，啟車邏。逾四寸，啟南關。逾四寸，啟新壩。再逾四寸，啟中壩。秋後車邏定制，以水高一丈二尺八寸爲率，南關各壩，仍以四寸爲限。去年六月望前，霖雨經旬，加以洪湖上游，水勢盛漲，秋前已逾限一尺之多，上憲皆以保守爲說。揚道憲龐省三觀察，親臨工次，蓋啟壩以全民命，保壩以衛民生，皆以爲民，未可偏是。保至秋後，水高至一丈六尺，因於十六日啟車邏，二十日更啟南關，二十四日啟新壩，水勢乃漸退云。</p>
<h3>巨猴為崇</h3>
<p>印度有村名阿古巴拉者，近日忽來大猴二百餘隻，識者謂此白婆姆之種也。此種猴俱身長三四尺許，精壯而膽大，毫不畏人，且遍入鄕民之家，攫食果餌，戲弄雜物，婦女及幼孩，俱受其虐，人雖惡之而不敢擊。緣此種猴，一爲人擊，即羣來報復，故雖有巡捕，亦莫敢誰何也。現聞已奏於朝，請撥兵以剿之矣。</p>

<h3>商業道德與信譽</h3>
<p>— 褚</p>
<p>自從發現了升籮里襯馬糞紙，油杓中墊洋鉛皮之後，其他欺騙取巧的方法，如磅秤不足等，幾乎每天有得發現，在生活程度如此高漲的今日，這種層層剝削的手段，我們覺得僅僅罰款，似乎還不足以儆效尤。</p>
<p>不過，這些欺騙取巧的方法，一定不自今日始，我們未嘗見過買油的人家眞正用秤秤過，也沒有人在米糧上計較輕重，其他餅乾糖菓自然更沒有注意到分兩之差了。於是十百扣一，也好像是正常的行爲，不足爲病了。譬如最近有兩家很著名的餅乾糖菓公司，也被查到磅秤不足而罰款，蓄植公司竟以沒有消毒的牛奶應市了，他們都是滬上歷史悠久的公司，豈肯爲了些微之利，破壞公司的營業信譽？如果允許我說句武斷的話，他們的磅秤上不知磅過多少噸的餅乾糖菓了，而沒有消毒的牛奶或許也曾使人生過腸胃病，不過，直到今天，才被發現而已。</p>
<p>做買賣應堅守商業道德自然是第一要旨，同時更應處處注意自己的缺點，不要以爲顧客的馬虎，也就隨意應付；要知道顧客的馬虎，是一種信任你的表示，這是營業上最寳貴的收穫，但一旦被發現了弊病，你所收穫的利潤是抵不過你將要遭受到損失的。</p>
<p>至於故意以欺騙的手段來朦蔽顧客的，自然說不到道德問題，我前面已經說過，罰款對於他們是太輕的懲罰，不過，歸根結蒂，做生意最重信譽，信譽破產之後，一定會遭遇到必然的最大的懲罰的。</p>
<h3>談畢業紀念刊</h3>
<p>— （權）</p>
<p>近日各學校又準備出畢業紀念刋及年刋了，關於各問題，某報曾展開熱烈的討論，在孤島各級市民遭物價嚴重威脅的當兒，筆者也願抒管見，來討論討論。</p>
<p>紀念刋或年刋的發行，當然含有紀念的意義；這種意義，當然也不能一筆抹煞，這種紀念刋的發行，在一生的生活史上，也許成爲可寳貴的一頁。筆者在高中畢業時，對於紀念刋的發行，雖未表反對，但亦未予重視，事隔多年，如今偶爾翻閱，回憶學生時代的生活，不禁滄桑之感。當時　本不値重視的本子，如今成了我的珍寳。但是事變境遷，如今一本畢業紀念刋，須四五元不辦，這非但太靡費，且在經濟困難的當兒，這四五元也非一般家長所能負擔了。</p>
<p>我認爲紀念刋的有紀念性，決不在裝璜的富麗，紙張的考究，或者登幾篇抄襲來的研究學術文章，我涊爲紀念刋要確實做到有紀念的價値，如師生之間的感情文字，各生在校生活的實錄等，其他序文，空洞的分別感，及花啊鳥啊的文藝作品，都不必浪費篇幅，而且只要白報紙印，這樣旣省錢，又有眞正的紀念意味。或者一級中的少數同學還不能負擔這費用，那當然不能勉强；可以合攝一團體照，用　團體照製成鋅版再來印刷，（因爲如叫照相館添印，價格極昂。）再在這團體照的反面大家簽名，這樣一張照片，我認爲也足够厚厚一本富麗紀念刋的價値了。再印一張通訊錄（可用油印機印刷），那眞是又簡又廉的紀念刊。執筆至此，想到去年有人提倡捐紀念刋費救難，我認爲富麗的紀念刋可以不印，但是最低限度的簡廉的紀念物却不可不印，再將所餘的錢救難，豈不好呢？</p>
<h3>新海上物價吟　（下）</h3>
<p>— 屠守拙</p>
<p>豆腐今朝肉價錢，十方竟賣一銀圓，以今較昔堪驚愕，五倍相差米戰前。　新春設宴把賓邀，上等佳肴炫富饒，五六十元一席菜，猶言款式不花描。　款客香烟白錫包，還　儉省惹人嘲，聽裝售價二元許，大好金錢火裏拋。　四角有零買　刀，富陽草紙價頻高，餘多紙類皆奇貴，紅紙每張賣兩毫。　售價異前可奈何，襪頭穿矣欠張羅，眞開　咪一元八，線襪每雙六角多。　止渴之資紅綠茶，鬥莊價値再三加，每斤起碼　元六，老葉無香異嫩芽。　油條樣似鉸鏈捧，大餅形同蟹壳黃，法幣　分買一件，勞工階級鬧飢荒。　大家漲價把心橫，暗貴明加分量輕，一個袁頭三鎊貨，年糕黃白換英衡。　麵坊店主亦精靈，平粉要求業暫停，新價兩斤四角六，機聲軋軋又開局。　樹頭鮮果價在增，貨斷還敎買未能，福橘只堪蜜橘代，一元僅得兩斤稱。　衡量今昔不相侔，水漲船高肥皂頭，昔日一羊爲九磅，今時四磅供人求。</p>
<p>商塲樞紐是黃金，外滙套頭決縱擒，五百元關瀕打破，牽連物價最驚心。　魚蝦佐酒興加酣，此際魚蝦貴不堪，一兩靑魚一角値，活蝦每隻三分三。　售銷獨特價稱廉，囤積無人是食鹽，菜秤每元百十兩，成交尙可酌加添。壓迫頓敎加等嚴，身難裸又口難緘，餘生刦後愁衣食，度日艱逾度峻巖。　（酬助平糶）</p>
<h3>給同情苦學生者　——覆支陶二君——</h3>
<p>— 強弓</p>
<p>本月六日拙作「一個缺席的學生」發表之後，方期從此减輕心靈上之負担，蓋亦盡執筆者報吿之職責耳。刻由編輯部轉下支陶兩君來函，均寄同情於一個缺席的苦學生而情願有以資助之，並以「果有其事吾，乞將該苦學生地址示覆。或係作者描摹現今社會小品文字」　情見詢，敬答如下：</p>
<p>一個缺席的學生，果有其人，亦有其事；即使陶君以爲「或係作者描摹現今社會小品文字」，亦必有其描摹之對象，蓋非向壁虛造者也。</p>
<p>爲了支陶二君對於該苦學生發生憐恤之心，深表無限同情而有所資助的一點，乃遺校役按址查訪，並帶去支陶原函給該生作爲「米票」之執據；然已返鄕，拳拳之意，無從轉致。苦人薄命，無有逾於此者矣！蓋本畢期該生亦未報名入學，前記經過情形，乃去冬冬雪中之一幕也。</p>
<p>不過像這樣的苦學生，在孤島的今日，想必不少，此後有遇，將隨時報吿支陶兩君，使其嘉惠苦學生之志，得早日如願以償，而作者亦將蒐集現社會之被壓迫者羣及其所處的非人的各個塲面，筆而出之，爲災黎覓慈航，望支陶　君之外，更有起來者。</p>
<h3>雨過天晴</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第廿一回　理經綸混合纖維持　興機械佐成文字功</p>
<p>朱愛人眞何家兩位小姐，在外國都不曾去參觀過報館，覺得很好玩。邵慧華道：</p>
<p>『此間的晚報不算多，也只有上海本市，與上海附近的幾處地方，當晚可以送到。因爲六點鐘，上海還有火車與汽車開到各碼頭，因此最後一次晚報，也就趕這個期　送出。那不過開極小一部分機器，若是早報，那就全部機器開動，這纔可觀咧。』吳君索道：『阿喲！這二十幾架機器，全行開動嗎？』邵慧華道：『雖不全行開動，至少也開十八九架。其餘數架，或是別架有什麽障碍，却要預備在加裏的。或者因爲它太辛苦，太勞乏了，像一個人一般，也要休息下的。報是每天老辰光要出版的，不能有什麽躭誤，所以寗可多備幾架機器呀。』吳君索道：『報紙從機器上出來以後，第二步工作，便是什麽呢？』邵慧華道：『你不瞧見每一機器的上面，有一個大天窗。這天窗，便是上一層樓了。印出的報，即由機上自動轉輪，輸往上層的天窗處，遞到樓上。樓上近天窗處，便是一個個的打包間，機器自動的送到打包間，便有人打好包。由打包間送到運報的卡車上，也有一條小軌道，臨時一搭起來。卡車裝滿，便飛馳而去，到火車站的到火車站，到輪船碼頭的到輪船碼頭，到飛機塲的到飛機塲。大槪從捲簡白紙送上機器，直到印好，打包，裝車，運送上舟，飛機，不出十分鐘光陰。發行上時間可算是極省，這也因爲一切都有了秩序，方可以按部就班。而且這是天天的事，弄得熟了，便能熟極而流。』吳君素道：『奇了！你們這些機器，都要分省而治嗎？你們道二十四架，難道分成了二十四省？或者是每一架機器，便給它個地方名稱，昨爲這機器的名字，像上海的路名，有什麽山東路，山西路，湖北路，河南路的名稱。不然，爲什麽每一架機器上。都排上一塊牌子，上面寫着各地方的地名呢？』邵慧華一看，笑道：『這是很有道理的。』便指着她近身一架機器道：『譬如這架機器上面，掛着浙江省的塊牌子，不用說，這架機器上所印出來的報紙，都運往浙江省去的。倘標明是別的省份的。也就是運往別的省份去的。』　（二五〇）</p>
<h3>天國的國民　（四）</h3>
<p>我們也不能因爲某人是體面人，就認他爲天國國民。體面人，許從來不維持正義，擁護道德，許從無慷慨，勇敢，和不自私之心。尼哥底母是很體面的人，彼拉多，也是很體面的人，但他們沒有勇敢冒險維持正義。許多體而的人。只能消極不做惡事，不能積極提倡正義。就道德上說，他們是不錯，就精神上說，他們是死的。他們相信上帝，却不肯爲上帝冒險，他們相信上帝維持正義，但當緊要關頭，他們却不依靠上帝，轉而依靠人力。他們不敢犧牲，做道德上或精神上的冒險工作。所以，我們要做天國國民除眞誠體面之外，還得有崇高的信仰，　願天天與自己的野性奮鬥，使受我們的控制。爲維持正義，尊榮，和貞潔起見，我們要比願捨棄其他一切。天國就是代表着有眞理和正義的人生，舉凡個人的生活和社會的工作，都得于耶穌所訂的這些資格—寬容，慈善，不自私，善意等的引導之下進行。每逢主日我們背主禱文說，「願主的國降臨。」我們是否眞願主的國降臨？要知主的國不能從天而降，只能藉着我們的努力來臨。我們要自問有無做天國國民的勇敢，勞力，和意志？　如欲詳細研究請函郵箱一二二七號</p>

<p>昨聽奚嘯伯演鳥盆記，奚扮劉世昌唱西皮元板，「嘆人生」一段，尺寸稍快，至「天色變」唱散時，將「變」字屬於前言撇窄音，嘯伯嗓子高部發達，故善發此音，「行路」一塲，以此處為最佳，次塲唱「好個趙大　」段中，「有」自嫌低，「中途」之中字嫌高，與「途」字使低音不相生，聲調高低最要相生，不相生則名曰硬山隔嶺，「中」字雖陰平聲，不必使高音，（工尺譜六字），因「途」字陽平聲使低，（工尺譜在四字上），由六到四，不協調也，此事看來似小，關係其實甚大，此乃音律精粗之辨，不可不注意及之。唱「是是是來明白了，」二句，全學馬連良唱法，連良唱片此二句，不知戲者，多以為好聽，試聽其明字，來字，陽平聲，皆用北平音，有倒字之嫌。唱「老丈不必」一段，大體甚佳，「把」字，「鏖」字，皆可，微欠滿耳，「未曾開言」之大段反二簧，開頭尺寸太快，「老天爺降下雨來」，使老調之高腔，甚好，此調多年不曾聽得矣。「有三載」後，加出一大塊腔來，此腔甚貧，可以減去。「劈頭蓋臉」之臉字腔，甚足，「可憐我」之可字，拖長數段，我字忽然大慢，此言菊朋發明之新發也，亦不足為法。憐字唱在板上，亦不合板位，一路唱來皆快「尺寸」，至此忽然「搬慢」得特別，為唱律所不許，此三字腔，以過去譚派票友王雨田唱出最佳，可以參考。總之，奚嘯伯高音漂亮音未至蒼老之境，故此戲哀情不足，再過數年，勤加磨練，不難登峰造極，現時不宜多唱悲劇。如劉鴻聲派之據，斬子，斬黃袍，嘯伯嗓音唱來，必可風靡一時，用兵須用長，吾之說，不知嘯伯聽得入耳否？（完）</p>
<h3>影星的迷信</h3>

<h3>所喇</h3>
<p>— 舍翁</p>
<p>關於舞台上塲面所使用的一切樂器，確是支配劇情的工具，不問是歌是舞，是說白，是做作，生動和停止，莫不由音樂上抒發轉變二盡其幫助的能事。不但演戲人賴以生活，就是觀衆亦因為有音樂推動，遂不感到寂寞。樂器中一件鎖喇，可稱是古氣最足的東西，其興奮的意思，實比笙簫管笛來得雄厚，皮黃據中嘗有用鎖喇吹唱牌子的，內行名曰「大字」，現在却有吹無唱，大多數已由所調大字而變成無字。筆者觀到翠屏山一劇，在楊雄回家他妻正和他一照面時，楊雄突然伸出手掌，摑了巧雲粉頰，這時塲面上，吹出短短的鎖喇聲音，如說　也是幫助動作，未免莫名其妙，似乎亦非充分要顯示楊雄怒的情緒。還有在巧雲面上，着了一下耳光之後，接着楊雄又給她另一面摑去，依然鎖喇又響出同樣聲調，且像繼續上半段牌子，但不知道兩下隨楊雄之手着到巧雲耳光所發出的鎖喇，有唱無唱，應屬誰唱？其詞句為何種意義，都難索解。除非他有所本，是從崑曲或由秦腔濫觴而來，在沒得到正確解答前，終要認為神秘，而在淺陋的觀者，更要以為潘巧雲面孔是有聲帶的笑話了。</p>

<h3>貢獻於電影刊物</h3>
<p>— 錢珍妮</p>
<p>編者先生：我是一個十足的影迷，對於中外新片，一年就要看到一二百部之多，還有幾種嗜好：一種是搜集說明書和戲票票根，到如今，連奧迪安愛普羅的都有。一種是珍藏明星照片，關於這層，我以為要有親筆簽名的最好，然而我很遺憾，向明星爾索得到的很少，可見這層的不容易。再有一種是廣購電唁刊物，自小報至申報早期的電影副刊，我都珍藏着。前讀游藝界，知道三月二十二日前將有一種「中國影訊」圖文綜合週刊出版，這不僅在我，恐怕讀者們都認為一個好消息吧。我對於任何電唁刊物，抱有至低的希望：第一點，一定要像「游藝界」一般抱着純正的宗旨，內容方面，避免攻訐等惡意紀載，因為這就是間接的欺騙讀者，每期專刊有趣味的珍訊，還盼望有電影歌曲常識介紹。第二點，形式一定要美觀，照片紙張印刷都須考究，這樣才會使讀者永久保存。第三點，能夠向明星代索簽名照片轉贈讀者，這更為影迷求之不得的。</p>
<p>在中國電影刊物十分貧乏之中，我很盼望先生贊助新刊物的誕生，這就無形中促進中國電影專業的發展，你以為如何？　錢珍妮上</p>
<p>（編者按）珍妮先生的希望，確是很合理，我一向也痛恨無聊的影劇刊物，住往無端的攻訐私人，這實在是不道德不純正的態度，所以本刊素以「隱惡揚善」為應守的本分。關於「中國影訊」定二十二日創刊，據說是很充實美滿的刊物。</p>

<h3>The Japanese Army, Advancing West from Chao-Shan, Suffers a Complete Collapse and Retreats to Anbu. Chinese Forces on the Yong-Qin Road Recapture Numerous Strongholds; Japanese Reinforcements from Xiaodong and Nachen Suffer a Crushing Defeat.</h3>
<p>Meixian: The Japanese, advancing west from Chao-Shan in three routes, have been intercepted fiercely by the Chinese army at Aoding Mountain, Datouling, Fugang, Qingma Mountain, Sangpu Mountain, Shaxi, and other places for days on end. Mobile units have also launched fierce assaults on the Japanese flanks and rear. The Japanese have been repeatedly cut off and surrounded by the Chinese forces. By noon on the 12th, the Japanese army suffered a complete collapse, breaking through and retreating towards Anbu. The Chinese army is pursuing on multiple routes, inflicting heavy casualties. The remaining Japanese forces, having retreated to the fortress city, are now heavily surrounded by the Chinese army and are on the verge of complete annihilation. (Dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<p>Liuzhou: On the morning of the 12th, Chinese forces attacked and recaptured the Twelve Altars north of Datang on the Yong-Qin Road, killing over 300 Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army from Datang launched a counterattack with over 20 trucks full of soldiers against the Chinese forces. Fierce fighting continued until night. After the recapture of the Twelve Altars by the Chinese forces, over 20 Japanese trucks attempted to reinforce from Nachen, triggering Chinese landmines en route, destroying five Japanese vehicles and killing many Japanese soldiers. (Dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<p>Binyang: The Japanese army at Dongkuangtai and other places were attacked by Chinese forces on the afternoon of the 11th. By the morning of the 12th, strongholds on the eastern side of the Yong-Qin Road, such as Sanchaling, Xiziling, Tongguling, and Gaobiaoling, were successively recaptured, killing several hundred Japanese soldiers. After the recapture of Daluling by the Chinese forces, the remaining Japanese forces in the vicinity were completely eliminated. It is estimated that over 500 Japanese soldiers were killed. The Japanese army sent over 100 trucks of reinforcements, along with numerous artillery pieces and two aircraft, from Xiaodong. On the morning of the 12th, under artillery and aerial cover, they launched a fierce counterattack against the Chinese forces. The Japanese aircraft even dropped incendiary bombs indiscriminately, setting fire to all the vegetation. The Chinese officers and soldiers were exceptionally enraged and engaged the Japanese in hand-to-hand combat, each man fighting as if he were a hundred. After three hours of intense fighting, over half of the Japanese forces were annihilated. Subsequently, the Japanese continued to reinforce with trucks from Datang. Bloody fighting continued until night. (Dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to a foreign military observer who recently returned to Chongqing from the Guinan frontlines, the temporary cessation of Sino-Japanese hostilities in the southern Guangdong region is expected to continue for some time. The primary reason is the onset of the rainy season. When he was north of Kunlun Pass, the area had experienced continuous rainfall for four days, and it is expected that even heavier rains will fall soon, making large-scale military operations in the area very difficult. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: In the past week, the Japanese have made great efforts to invade Jieyang, suffering heavy losses due to ambushes by various Chinese units. Regarding the Japanese setbacks and the current situation, a military spokesperson told a Central News Agency reporter that the Japanese offensive on Jieyang was launched in two routes, north and south. The northern route advanced from Chaoan along Aogu Lane, launching a fierce attack on Jieyang. The southern route advanced from Anbu along Sangpu Mountain and Xiapu Mountain towards Dagang. Seeing that the Japanese had ventured deep, the Chinese army dispatched surprise troops from all directions to cut off the Japanese rear. After three days and nights of encirclement, the Japanese forces completely collapsed. On the northern route, the Japanese army at Aoding Mountain was subjected to a night attack by the Chinese forces, suffering nearly complete casualties. The remaining Japanese soldiers fled back along the original route. There are no longer any traces of the Japanese army in the vicinity. The Japanese reinforcements attempting to advance west along the Chao-Jie Highway from Guxiang were routed midway by the Chinese forces, scattering in disarray and suffering heavy casualties. On the southern route, the Japanese launched a fierce westward offensive starting on the 7th, but were repeatedly intercepted and annihilated by the Chinese army, suffering over half of their forces. The Japanese forces in the Xiapu Mountain area were surrounded and annihilated by the Chinese army, suffering exceptionally heavy casualties. A portion of the Japanese forces, cut off due to the blocked highway, were surrounded by the Chinese army in the area west of Xiapu Mountain and are being annihilated. (Dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<p>Wengyuan: A portion of the Japanese army from Guantang (east of Zengcheng) invaded the Jiudong area on the morning of the 12th, attempting to loot food. They were attacked and killed by the Chinese army, and the remaining Japanese soldiers retreated in a panic. (Dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing: The battle situation in Zhongshan is becoming increasingly fierce. For days on end, Chinese forces have launched fierce attacks on the Japanese army along the two highways from Shiqi to Guanhaizha and from Shiqi to Dieshi, inflicting heavy casualties. Although the Japanese have continuously sent reinforcements from Xinhui and Shunde, their offensive has been halted by the Chinese army. Currently, Shiqi and Xiaolan are both under tight control by the Chinese forces. (Dispatch of the 13th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: A spokesperson for the Chinese army commented today on the battles in northeastern Guangdong Province, saying that the Japanese attempt to occupy Shantou northwest and Jieyang has failed due to the Chinese recapture of Chenghai, northeast of Shantou. It is reported that after the puppet army led by Huang Dawei occupied Chenghai, the Japanese army transferred a division of troops from the Yangtze River region to fight in the Shantou area, with Jieyang as their destination. On March 7th, the Japanese army launched an attack on Jieyang in two routes, one from Anpu and the other from Renan. The Chinese army defended against the Japanese army attacking from the west while simultaneously dispatching a strong Chinese force to bypass the Japanese flanks and attack their rear, recapturing Chenghai on March 8th. As a result, the Japanese army retreated towards Shantou. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)</p>

<h3>Overseas Department Attention: Unite Spirits, Coordinate Actions</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, various domestic organizations have sent personnel overseas with numerous titles, lacking coordination, often arousing suspicion among the overseas department and overseas Chinese groups, leading to disputes and numerous abuses. It has been heard that the overseas department, in order to unite spirits and coordinate actions, has sent letters to the Executive Yuan, the Military Affairs Commission, and various organizations, stipulating that in the future, central or local (including Hong Kong and Macau) organizations that send personnel overseas to engage in national salvation work, such as soliciting donations, organizing societies, recruiting personnel, and investigating overseas Chinese affairs, regardless of whether they are party members or not, should personally contact the overseas department or its Hong Kong office first for liaison, in order to notify the local party branches and consulates overseas to provide assistance, prevent villains from taking advantage of the name to confuse the truth, and strengthen the power of resistance.

<h3>Chongqing Newspapers Welcome Soviet-Finnish Peace</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The local newspapers all express joy at the establishment of a peace treaty between the Soviet Union and Finland, believing that the Soviet Union's worries in Western Europe have been lifted and that it can turn its attention to the Far East. According to the Xinhua Daily, the newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, the peace between the Soviet Union and Finland is tantamount to the surrender of the imperialists. Imperialist countries have spoken daily of assisting Finland, but in reality, they have only provided a small amount of loans. Their assistance to China already reveals a glimpse of their sacrifice of oppressed nations. Therefore, in the struggle of nations, regardless of domestic or foreign policy, independence is essential. (United Press dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: An editorial in the Dagong Bao this morning criticized the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty, saying that the treaty has provided the Soviet Union with a guarantee of security and prevented the spread of the European war. The Soviet Union's entry into Poland, its treaties with the Baltic states, and its decision to conclude a peace treaty with Finland have completed its western defense program. This western border is now safe and free from any possible aggression from Europe. The Soviet-Finnish peace can also prevent the possibility of a direct conflict between the Soviet Union and Britain and France. The Soviet Union now fears not an attack from Britain and France, but an attack from Germany and Japan. However, since Germany is currently reliant on Soviet aid, and regardless of the outcome of the European war, Germany's attack on the Soviet Union after the war is impossible. Therefore, it can be safely inferred that the Soviet Union's relations with Britain and France will not continue to deteriorate (and the Soviet Union can also avoid an attack from Germany). The current position of the Soviet Union has enabled it to turn to the Far East, aiding China in resisting Japan. If the Japanese militarists collapse, the Soviet Union will not only help China but will also eliminate the threat to its eastern border. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Prisoners Express Extreme Desire to Naturalize</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The reporter visited a prisoner of war camp in a certain place yesterday and saw that the rooms were clean, the equipment was complete, the prisoners were lively, and their lives were comfortable. They shook hands with the reporter and spoke freely, expressing great satisfaction. The remarks of fourteen people, including Oyama Masao, who were recently brought from a certain place, are briefly recorded as follows: (Most of us voluntarily surrendered in a certain place in December last year because those who disrupt the peace of East Asia are the Japanese militarists. In order to save East Asia, we are extremely willing to participate in the movement to overthrow the Japanese militarists. Japan's launch of the war against China has increased the suffering of the Japanese people, consumed Japan's national strength, and brought nothing to the people. Now our families are living in difficult circumstances, our parents, wives, and children are starving and freezing, unable to support them. The national finances have reached a dead end, and there is a lack of manpower in rural areas and factories, resulting in a great shortage of production. The signs of national subjugation are already evident. Therefore, we must join hands with China, work together to restore peace in East Asia, and hope to be naturalized as Chinese people, to work for the peace of China and the East or the Far East.

The prerequisite is to properly plan for the replenishment of production factors, to expand land utilization by clearing and reclaiming wasteland, to promote rural economic activity through agricultural loans, and to improve the health of the people through sanitation. Other items such as water conservancy and transportation are also properly planned. In order to arouse public attention, a production exhibition has been held in Lanzhou since the 12th.

<h3>The Lessons and Future of the Current World</h3>
<p>Here, I would like to offer a third discussion on the affairs of Finland and the Soviet Union, and I especially wish to express my thoughts to the people of Britain, France, America, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Finland's acceptance of the Soviet Union's proposal, abandoning resistance, ceding territory, and making peace, has stirred world public opinion with diverse reactions, with the intensity reaching an extreme. The Soviet Union is smug and content, Finland is grief-stricken and in pain, Germany is rejoicing, Italy is delighted, Sweden and Norway are ashamed, fearful, and joyous, Britain and France regret and seek to improve, and the Americans are regretful, lamenting, and unable to hide their shock. Indeed, because the problem is complex and the impact is far-reaching, the observations differ in their aspects, and the estimations differ in their angles, the feelings and perceptions are necessarily so different. In light of these different perceptions of the same problem, international events should not be measured rashly. Is it not pedantic to measure them by right and wrong? Is it not narrow-minded to measure them by profit and loss? Is it not superficial to measure them by emotion? Is it not narrow-minded to measure them by reality? Is it not helping the violent and flattering the wicked? Is it not obstructive and slow, and of no benefit to the overall situation, to measure them by lofty and outstanding ideals? To insist on one of these and measure by it will create its own discourse, but how can it be a definitive conclusion!</p>
<p>Regarding Finland and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union has launched both diplomatic and military offensives against Finland since last autumn. What is the nature of this, and what is its intention? When it gradually gained favorable timing and gradually controlled geographical advantages in the war, it then opened up a path of negotiation and sought peace. Although what it took from Finland was very substantial, according to Swedish Foreign Minister Gunther, the terms of the compromise were milder than those initially conveyed by Sweden. This means that the Soviet Union still left room for Finland to maneuver during the negotiations, and the question of whether to comply or resist was for the Finnish government authorities to consider and choose as an independent and free country. The initial nature and intention have received little forgiveness from world opinion, and the final initiative and turnaround can also be criticized. However, supposing the Soviet Union had not done this and had decided to destroy Finland and intended to expand the European war, what would the consequences of this supposition be? There is absolutely no objective fact to serve as the premise for the argument of the supposition, and there is no way to draw a conclusion but much to think about deeply. In this situation, I believe that countries should make two judgments about the Soviet Union: first, that the signing of the peace treaty by the legitimate government of Finland should be recognized in law and in fact as a success for the Soviet Union; and second, that the Soviet Union's turnaround in its attitude towards Finland should be recognized psychologically and practically as the Soviet Union's willingness to compromise. Such a judgment may be an important factor in planning to stabilize the international situation.</p>
<p>The anguish and grievances of the Finnish government in signing the peace treaty will certainly be met with universal sympathy. And its loyal and brave resistance for over a hundred days has ended under these tragic conditions. Not only is it a case of "not the fault of war," but it has also, through glorious war achievements, preserved the independence and freedom of the nation. From the beginning, if it had not resisted, it would inevitably have been politically reduced to a vassal of the Soviet Union; if it had resisted and been utterly defeated, it would have been fundamentally destroyed, as the examples of Czechoslovakia and Poland show. If we set aside the cases of Czechoslovakia and Poland and take the highest example, comparing it with China, Finland is very different from China. The various objective conditions and inherent conditions of the Finnish nation make it impossible for it to resist the Soviet Union and achieve victory on its own. Therefore, China has this confidence and fights, while Finland would be acting recklessly to do so. This is one difference. China expects spiritual and material assistance from friendly nations, and although the assistance received is regrettably small, it has already contributed to the resistance. Finland, in addition to spiritual and material assistance, also hopes for military and manpower support, but this is like a drop in the bucket, too slow to be of any help. This is a second difference. Japan's ambition towards China is to swallow it whole, and its situation is akin to a snake swallowing an elephant. The Soviet Union's peace with Finland proves that its ambition is not to swallow it, and this cannot be used as proof. Its situation is akin to an elephant swallowing a snake. The differences do not stop there, but even with these three points, those who support China's resistance understand the Finnish abandonment of resistance and the painful cession of territory and the making of peace. Those in world opinion who regret the abandonment of Finland's resistance are no different from those who watch a fire from across the river. Those in world opinion who say that Finland has since fallen into the hands of the Soviet Union must look at how the Soviet Union will implement its policies, how Finland will conduct itself, and how Finland's environment and the evolution of the world situation will develop. To hastily regard Finland today as having lost its independence and freedom is either malicious or a neurotic pessimism, not a definitive argument.</p>
<p>The ending of one of the three major events of the day with the cessation of hostilities and the making of peace by Finland and the Soviet Union is, from a local point of view, a move from motion to stillness, from abnormality to normality. However, the impact it has will certainly be seen as a powerful impetus to the global situation. It is still difficult to predict which way the global situation will develop after this impetus. It may even develop in multiple directions simultaneously, even in surprising, frightening, or joyous ways, but in any case, it is definitely not an anomaly. We do not need to assume any particular direction of development and try to discuss it here, but if we take some lessons from the Finnish-Soviet problem and place them in the present, engraving them in our hearts, we firmly believe that it will definitely be helpful in dealing with the developing global situation. What are the lessons? The most noteworthy among them are: (1) The League of Nations is useless without reorganization and replenishment. At the beginning of the Finnish dispute, the League of Nations gathered to deal with it. Although China abstained, dozens of countries voted to expel the Soviet Union from membership and to assist Finland in resisting. But what harm did this do to the Soviet Union, and what benefit did it bring to Finland? The League of Nations has only exposed itself as needing to be reorganized and replenished. (2) The prestige of Britain, France, and America, although undiminished in essence and strong in self-confidence, has fallen sharply in objective evaluation. Therefore, what Britain, France, and America want to repel has failed to stop people. To make people stop, they must take a few steps forward themselves. (3) To provide assistance, one must look at the need, one must be proportionate, and one must be timely. If blood is needed but iron is given, if iron is needed but wheat is given, if wheat is needed but banknotes are given, it is not useless, but it is not effective. If one hundred is needed but ninety-nine is given, it will also be a failure. If it is needed today but promised for the future, it will be of little use for mourning. (4) Spiritual and material aspects cannot be separated. In terms of the spiritual aspect, whether domestic or international, can Finland have any regrets, yet it ultimately had to submit to material forces and sacrifice material things? Yesterday's commentators said that Finland's not fighting affects the spirit of Britain and France more than it affects material things. This is either very thoughtless or a deceitful statement. It is fortunate that Finland did not perish. If it had perished, even with a little luck, its national spirit would have been enough to adorn eternity. Who can deny it, but what good would it do? (5) In wartime, only military means can promote diplomacy. Diplomacy cannot make up for the inadequacy of military means. Those who believe in diplomacy and rely on diplomacy will fail at least in the diplomatic sphere. Britain and France have no regrets about their diplomacy with Finland, but because they lack military strength, diplomacy is useless. In the case of Sweden and Norway, diplomatic failure has hindered military means. (6) The investment and assistance of Britain and France in Czechoslovakia and Poland have, at least for the time being, been reduced to nothing. However, the claims on Finland still exist, and the rights and interests in China still exist. This is because of the power of resistance. Poland was defeated and the situation in Eastern Europe changed. Finland submitted and the situation in Northern Europe changed. Only the precarious situation in East Asia can still be sustained. This is because of the power of resistance. China will never deny the benefits of American, Soviet, British, and French assistance to the resistance, but based on the facts and lessons, it must be recognized that this is not the effect of these countries' assistance to China, but the merit of China's resistance to Japan. If the resister does not resist, the assistance is in vain. If the resister is ultimately defeated, the assistance will be lost.</p>
<p>I hope that the people of Britain and France will think deeply about these lessons. I hope that the people of America will think deeply about them. The Soviet Union is China's best friend. Please let them think more deeply about the Far East based on their own experiences. How should we deal with the unresolved problems of the world? I especially hope that people of all countries will think deeply about the fact that the way to stabilize the international situation is through various principles that are either proposed or recognized by all parties. Today, deviations from these principles are coming one after another. And those who are defeated, those who perish, and those who submit, after years have passed, those who have reaped benefits from deviating from these principles will have managed and digested what they have gained. Fortunately, China in the Far East still has a strong resistance. Otherwise, after a few more years, even if the principles eventually triumph, what kind of situation would the world be in? If we do not make every effort to coordinate and deal with these problems now, but wait until the years pass and we must revive the dead one by one, what is the calculation?</p>
<h3>British Indian Affairs Minister Shot by Indian, Prominent Indian Government Official Vaudoyer Dies, Perpetrator Mohan Singh Arrested on the Spot, Motive Seemed to Be Resistance to Oppressive Policies</h3>
<p>London – Last night, the Indian Association held a meeting in Caxton Hall, London. Suddenly, an Indian man fatally shot Sir Michael O'Dwyer, former Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, and wounded Sir Seton, the Minister of Indian Affairs, Sir Dane, former Governor of the Punjab, and Lord Lamington, former Governor of Bombay. Dane's arm was severed, and Seton was grazed by a bullet and fell beside the chairman's seat. The well-known Middle East authority Sykes was beside him but was unharmed. O'Dwyer, however, was shot in the chest, fell to the ground, and bled profusely. Order was immediately disrupted, and police cordoned off the meeting hall. Approximately 450 people were not allowed to leave or make telephone calls. The police recorded statements from everyone, which took two and a half hours. After being admitted to the hospital, Minister of Indian Affairs Seton found a bullet in his clothing. Seton told reporters that he heard a gunshot and felt a pain in his side before falling to the ground, followed by several more gunshots. The perpetrator was a short, stocky Indian man with a dark complexion. He squeezed to the press seats and fired four shots in a row. He then held the gun high and shouted, "Get out!" He fled from the crowd, but two people jumped up to hold him down. The police then escorted him to a police car and drove him to the police station. Shortly after, officials issued information stating that an Indian man named Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, 37, was charged with the murder of O'Dwyer and the attempted murder of Seton, Lamington, and Dane, and would be tried in criminal court today. After the tragedy, Sykes told a Reuters reporter, "I was lecturing on the situation in Afghanistan at the meeting, which was attended by about 400 people, with about 50 more standing on the sides. As the meeting was adjourned and I was saying goodbye to Seton, I suddenly heard several gunshots and then saw O'Dwyer fall to the ground. I chased after the perpetrator and saw a woman named Miss Herring bravely step forward to stop the perpetrator, even though he had a firearm. The perpetrator eventually pushed Miss Herring aside. Fortunately, an Englishman named Lees tackled the perpetrator from behind, and Indian police officer Captain Pendergast also stepped forward to assist, pinning the perpetrator to the ground. Lees handed me the perpetrator's gun, and after a brief look, I saw that it was a large military handgun, and it had probably fired five shots, but I did not disassemble it and handed it over to the police. I returned to check on O'Dwyer and he had died. Sir Dane was wounded in the arm, and Lord Lamington was wounded in the hand. Seton was knocked down but his injuries were very minor. There was no panic in the hall, and everyone behaved very well. In my opinion, the perpetrator was a sturdy Asian man, about 40 years old. He seemed to be chewing on some kind of pill in the hall, and people were paying attention to him because they didn't know who he was. Before the shooting, he put his hand in his vest, where the gun was hidden." (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>London – "Scotland Yard" (British National Criminal Investigation Department) recently issued a bulletin stating, "The East India Association and the Royal Central Asian Society held a joint meeting today, chaired by Major General Sir Sykes. Prominent Indian government official Sir Michael O'Dwyer, Minister of Indian Affairs Lord Seton, Sir Donald, and Lord Lamington all attended. As the meeting ended, a single assailant fired six shots in a row. Sir Michael O'Dwyer died on the spot, and three others were injured. The perpetrator fled into the crowd, but the police have arrested a suspect and scheduled him for interrogation tomorrow morning." According to general observations, this case clearly has political implications, as Sir Michael O'Dwyer served as Governor of the Punjab in India. During his tenure, the region was troubled, with repeated riots. British military commander General Dyer suppressed them severely, while Sir Michael O'Dwyer defended him, thus incurring much criticism. Furthermore, he did not support the concept of a pan-Indian federation and was strongly opposed to Gandhi's activities. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>London – Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today regarding the Caxton Hall shooting incident, "We express our deepest sympathy to Lady O'Dwyer and her family for their tragic loss, and we wish all those injured a speedy recovery. As far as he knows, the injuries are not serious and the progress is good." Chamberlain continued to describe the incident and announced the perpetrator's name as Mohan Singh. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>New Delhi – At today's meeting of the Council of States, the opposition leader proposed a resolution condemning the assassination of former Punjab Lieutenant-Governor Sir Michael O'Dwyer and requesting the chairman to express deep condolences to Lord Seton, the British Secretary of State for India. Leaders and members of other parties also seconded the motion. The Punjab Legislative Council in Lahore also passed a resolution today condemning the Caxton Hall attack. Mr. Lal, a representative of the Congress Party, stated that any action that violates the Congress Party's creed of nonviolence is not acceptable to the Congress Party, but the Congress Party will not participate in this resolution.

<h3>Japanese Navy Unwilling to Open the Yangtze River, Citing Third-Country Aid to China</h3>
<p>Tokyo – A spokesman for the Japanese Naval Ministry stated today that third-country aid to the National Government would delay the opening of the Yangtze River, as this aid would enhance Chinese military strength and hinder Japan's efforts to clear the Yangtze River. The spokesman cited the U.S. loan of $20 million to China as evidence of second-country aid to China. He stated that the U.S. demands that Japan reopen the Yangtze River, but at the same time aids Japan's enemy, which is incomprehensible. (United Press dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Gandhi Urges Indians to Wait for the Right Moment, Not to Trouble Britain for the Time Being</h3>
<p>Calcutta – According to reliable sources here today, Indian national movement leader Gandhi has asked the All India Congress, which is currently meeting in Ramgarh, not to trouble Britain while it is preoccupied with events in Western Europe, and to wait for the right moment before raising the demand for national self-determination. However, some believe that the conclusion of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty will influence the decision of the All India Congress, as the uncompromising faction led by Bose will use the reason that the Soviet Union no longer threatens Britain to seek the realization of Indian national demands. Meanwhile, Gandhi also arrived here this morning. As his car drove to the All India Congress, there were thousands of welcomers along the way. (United Press dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Singapore Port Authority Strike Incident, MacDonald Responds to Questions in the House of Commons</h3>
<p>London – During last night's meeting of the House of Commons, Labor MP Jones asked what steps the government has taken to improve the conditions of Singapore port workers and whether there were actions to evict skilled workers from their homes. Colonial Secretary MacDonald replied that he was instructing Governor Thomson to provide information on the current situation in the area. MacDonald also responded to Jones's supplementary question, saying that he was not certain whether there were any evictions from their homes, and that he would take appropriate action when he received the report. Labor MP and Mr. Wilson asked whether it was strange that labor unrest had occurred in almost all colonies since MacDonald took office as Colonial Secretary. MacDonald did not answer this question.

<h3>British Loan to China Negotiations in Progress, Butler Answers Questions from Members of the House of Commons</h3>
<p>London – During this afternoon's meeting of the House of Commons, opposition Liberal MP Roper raised questions on the issue of aid to China, stating that the U.S. Federal Export-Import Bank had recently granted a line of credit of $20 million to China, and that Britain also had an obligation to aid China in accordance with the resolutions passed by the League of Nations General Assembly. He asked whether the government was prepared to take appropriate measures to provide similar assistance to China. Foreign Office Under-Secretary Butler immediately replied that China and Britain were seemingly in negotiations regarding this matter, and that the British government was fully aware of the obligations stipulated by the League of Nations resolutions and would do its best to fulfill them under the current difficult circumstances. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>The Minai Declaration Is Not Worth Taking Seriously, London Comments</h3>
<p>London – Regarding Japanese Prime Minister Minai's statement yesterday that Japan wants to respect China's independence and freedom, although newspapers have not yet commented, Reuters has learned that officials and Far East experts here believe that this statement has nothing new and does not mention the issues that other countries want to hear. Minai's statement did not mention the conditions Japan is giving to Wang Jingwei, nor did he reiterate Konoe's guarantee that Japan would not demand territory or reparations, nor did he clarify the exact nature of Japan's "New Order in East Asia." Although Tokyo newspapers have repeatedly discussed the meaning of the "New Order," they have never clearly explained it. Britain and the United States have already stated to Japan regarding the proposed Wang government that the two countries will abide by the resolutions of the Nine-Power Treaty and are unlikely to change their attitude. Chinese people here sneered at Minai's remarks and said that Wang Jingwei could not recruit any reputable figures. If Japan wants to continue its war in China, then China is prepared to wait and has no doubts about the outcome of the war. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Shipping Plans to Expand</h3>
<p>Tokyo – Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the tonnage of Japanese ships was only 4.5 million tons. Now, an expansion plan has been drawn up, with the goal of increasing it to 7.5 million tons by the end of 1942. Various shipping companies have also been recruiting a large number of sailors to meet the demand. According to statistics published in local newspapers, Japanese shipyards built a total of 50,000 tons of merchant ships last year, which requires approximately 6,000 sailors. However, due to the war, many workers have been absorbed by the military-related industries, and only 4,000 people have been hired as a result of the recruitment. But after the recent implementation of the Seamen's Insurance Law, this situation has changed. The 20 seamen's referral agencies plan to recruit 8,000 sailors this year. There is a continuous stream of applicants. Taking Tokyo as an example, the goal is to recruit 800 sailors, cooks, stewards, and firemen, but there have already been 1,500 applicants, which shows the enthusiasm. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Annam Returns Mail on Japanese Ship</h3>
<p>Osaka – The Osaka Shosen's "Saigon Maru," which had all its mail seized by Annam naval authorities in Saigon on the 12th, telegraphed the Osaka Shosen head office on the afternoon of the 14th, stating that all mail, except for a few small packages containing prohibited items, had been returned.

<h3>Japanese-Dutch East Indies Trade Negotiations to Be Held Soon</h3>
<p>Tokyo – The Japanese government and the Dutch East Indies authorities will hold trade negotiations soon.

It is reported that several more economic delegations will come to Japan in the near future to promote trade between Japan and Latin America. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>Finnish President Broadcasts Decision to Devote Efforts to Reconstruction, Rumors of a Provisional Government to Approve the Treaty, People of the Ceded Territories Prepare to Move to New Areas</h3>
<p>Helsinki – The Finnish President broadcast to the nation, expressing admiration for the army and gratitude for the people's bravery in the war, and stating that Finland must now devote itself to reconstruction. He also expressed confidence in Finland's future because its freedom remains intact and its army is ready to protect the country's existence at any time. It is now estimated that as a result of the war and the treaty, 400,000 Finnish civilians have lost their homes and property. Furthermore, according to General Mannerheim, Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Army, the Soviet Army suffered 200,000 casualties in the war, and lost 1,500 tanks and 700 aircraft.

<p>Helsinki – Finnish Prime Minister Ryti and other members of the Finnish delegation arrived here by plane this morning. All Finnish cabinet members, except for those who resigned, greeted them at the airport. It is unknown when the Diet will approve the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty, but the Diet will convene a meeting tomorrow. It is said that approval of the treaty requires a five-sixths majority vote in the Diet. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Copenhagen – According to news here today, the Finnish government will probably resign in its entirety and establish a provisional government to approve the peace treaty with the Soviet Union and resume relations with the Soviet Union. This move would allow those who advocate resisting the Soviet Union to avoid signing a humiliating peace treaty with the Soviet Union. (United Press dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Helsinki – Because the severity of the war situation has become increasingly clear, it is obvious that Finland has no other option but to make peace. Soviet troops have penetrated deep into southern Finland across the ice, forcing the coastal batteries east of Helsinki to open fire. It is reported that Finnish Prime Minister Ryti obtained guarantees from his parliamentary colleagues before going to Moscow, so there is no doubt that the country will approve the treaty. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Helsinki – Political figures here say that although the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty has been concluded, relations between the two countries remain tense. In addition, after the Soviet Union establishes a naval base on Finland's Hanko Peninsula, the two countries may have new disputes at any time. Sweden and Norway refuse to allow British and French troops to pass through their territory to Finland, so Finland's relations with those countries may not be good in the future. Foreign observers say that since a corner of Northern Europe will not become a battlefield, the Soviet Union can free up 40 army divisions and 2,000 aircraft for use in future operations. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Helsinki – After the conclusion of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty, people across the country expressed regret and dissatisfaction with the Scandinavian countries, blaming them for bearing responsibility. The radio address given by Danish Foreign Minister stated that foreign aid was insufficient and Finland's situation was dire, which was surprising to general public opinion because it was unexpected. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>Moscow – Moscow Radio reported that the entire Soviet Union is holding grand demonstrations to celebrate the conclusion of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty. The speeches stated that although the Soviet Union has acquired territory in the northwest after the successful conclusion of the war, it does not deny Finland's independent existence. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Stockholm – According to a Moscow correspondent for Aftonbladet, the Soviet Union plans to establish the Karelia Republic in the territory ceded by Finland, with Vytegra as its capital. Important government positions will be given to Finnish communists currently residing in the Soviet Union. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Finnish Government's Proclamation to the People</p>
<p>Helsinki – The Finnish government issued a proclamation to the people last night, stating that a ceasefire will take effect today after the signing of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty. Finland has been at war with a strong enemy since November 30 last year, for three and a half months. Countless soldiers have sacrificed themselves for the country, and the nation will forever admire them. Finland has decided to make peace, believing that peace can avoid even greater dangers. Finland's heroic soldiers and steadfast people, prepared to make the greatest sacrifices, have maintained their freedom and honor. The European war is not yet over, but we have restored peace. Remember our sacrifices and rebuild our country. The government will consider caring for the families of fallen soldiers as its responsibility and honor, and the people's work and bread as the government's most important duties. Compatriots residing in the ceded areas, and compatriots whose homes have been destroyed by the war, will be given new homes. All of these things require the greatest effort. Recent developments in recent hours have given us hope that we will become more united in times of crisis. At this critical moment, only mutual assistance and cooperation can lead to a bright future. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Finnish Commander-in-Chief's Message to the Troops</p>
<p>Helsinki – General Mannerheim, Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Army, Navy, and Air Force, issued a message to the troops yesterday, stating that the Finnish army sacrificed more than 15,000 soldiers in glorious battles. Although the Soviet army currently controls most of the battlefield, the Finnish army's achievements have unfolded a glorious page in world history. The Finnish soldiers' perseverance and sense of responsibility have accomplished difficult tasks, eliminating a huge number of enemy troops, shooting down more than 700 aircraft, and destroying more than 1,500 tanks. Women's groups also participated in wartime service, and workers risked bombing to take on wartime relief work, which is commendable. However, although the Finnish army can sacrifice heroically, Finland has not adequately prepared to fight against a powerful country, and the Finnish government has to accept harsh peace terms. The Finnish army resisted for sixteen weeks, holding an incomplete defense line and awaiting the assistance they expected, which failed to materialize. Only two battalions of volunteers participated in the fighting. However, if Sweden and Western European countries had not provided material assistance, the Finnish army would not have been able to fight for so long. The Finnish army has not collapsed, but the number of enemy troops continues to increase, and the Finnish army has had to retreat completely. The Finnish army is well aware that it bears the responsibility of safeguarding Western civilization in Eastern Europe and will continue to fight bravely to defend the motherland in the future.

<h3>Finland Suggests a Defense Alliance to Sweden and Norway, Both Countries Express Willingness to Discuss, Swedish Foreign Minister Speaks to Aid Finland's Reconstruction</h3>
<p>Helsinki – Finnish Foreign Minister Tanner told reporters last night that before the Finnish delegation went to Moscow, Sweden, Norway, and Finland had agreed to hold talks aimed at guaranteeing the borders of the two countries. These talks were initiated by Finland and will continue for several days. Tanner also said that Finland has not been pressured by Western powers before or during the war, and the peace was decided solely by the Finnish government. Germany did not participate in the mediation. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Stockholm – According to reliable sources here today, Sweden is now planning to form a defense alliance of a mutual assistance nature with Finland and Norway, (1) to protect Finland's new borderlines and to enhance the position of Sweden and Finland in the Baltic Sea, and to support Norway's neutral territorial waters rights. It is reported that this plan was submitted to the Finnish side by Sweden at the same time as the Soviet Union's peace terms were handed over. The Soviet Union also approved this plan in advance, stating that as long as it does not conflict with the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty, the Soviet Union will not object. (United Press dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Stockholm – The Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying that the Swedish government, in reply to the Finnish government's inquiry, has stated that it is prepared to examine the possibility of Norway, Sweden, and Finland concluding a defensive alliance. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Stockholm – It is not yet certain whether the talks on a joint Swedish-Norwegian guarantee of borders have indeed begun. The Swedish Foreign Ministry told a Reuters reporter today that, as far as they knew, the Norwegian government had agreed to consider the matter. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Oslo – Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht declared today that the Finnish government had asked Norway, Finland, and Sweden two days ago about the possibility of establishing a defense alliance, and the Norwegian government had replied that it was prepared to consider it.

<p>Oslo – A Norwegian newspaper reported that although the terms of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty are harsh, Norwegians welcome the signing of peace as a relief. The newspaper emphasized that it is now even more necessary than before to increase aid to Finland. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Stockholm – Foreign Minister Günther gave a radio address this evening, stating, "According to unofficial news, the Soviet Union and Finland have concluded a peace treaty. Although the Swedish nation is extremely saddened after hearing the contents of this treaty, it is still full of admiration for Finland's actions. As for the position of the countries on our role in this peace conference, there are many misunderstandings. In fact, we are only intermediaries. In short, Finland could not help but consider the peace conditions proposed by the Soviet Union, and it was not under pressure from any party. Fortunately, as a result of the negotiations between the two sides, the conditions accepted by Finland are different from those we relayed, which is somewhat gratifying. It is expected that the countries that failed to provide more assistance to Finland in accordance with the promises made last December were disappointed, but in fact, the country did not have any hope of winning. At this time, we should do our best to assist it, and never make any request in return. Our volunteers' sacrifices for that country will always be remembered. At this point, the most urgent thing for us is to assist its reconstruction. Do not think that the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty will be completed and we can rest easy. It is necessary to know that the current crisis still exists. After the change in the Finnish border, the general situation will become more delicate. Therefore, we must prepare to deal with unexpected events and should use Finland as a lesson." (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Fate of Northern European Countries Bleak, British Military Experts Observe</h3>
<p>London – According to military observers here today, from now on the entire Scandinavian Peninsula and Finland are under the shadow of Soviet military force. Even if Finland and Norway establish a Nordic Three-Country Defense Agreement, it cannot offset the strategic advantages given to the Soviet Union by the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty. In this treaty, Finland's defense forces have been invisibly restricted. At the same time, the Soviet Union's tentacles have spread to the entire peninsula. For example, the cession of Karelia has destroyed Finland's Mannerheim Line. This line is located in the most defensible location of Finland's natural environment, but after this location, there is no terrain that can build a line as strong as the Karelia Mannerheim Line. Therefore, from now on, national defense has lost its strongest barrier. Furthermore, after the Soviet Union has acquired bases on the Hanko Peninsula and the mainland, it has seized the most important heartland of southern Finland. Finland's granting of a railway to the Soviet Union in the mountainous region of its waist has opened a gateway for the Soviet Union to enter the Gulf of Bothnia, connecting it with Sweden, and further north to Petsamo. In addition to restricting Finland's naval power, it is necessary to allow the Soviet Union to enter and exit northern Norwegian cities. Therefore, from now on, not only will it be difficult for Finland to resist the Soviet Union again, but Sweden and Norway will also be threatened. (United Press dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>US Decides to Continue Aiding Finland, Assisting with Reconstruction; Roosevelt Condemns Soviet-Finnish Treaty, May Revise Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt last night vehemently condemned the Soviet-Finnish peace terms. He stated, "This war has not clarified the inherent rights of small nations to maintain their integrity against attacks by powerful nations. The Finnish people, with superhuman courage and steadfast resistance, have matched their strength against superior forces. They have earned the permanent peace and independent sovereignty of their nation. The Finnish people and government have increased the respect and fervent concern of the American people and government for Finland. The United States firmly believes that superior military force compelled Finland to accept peace." The President's statement indicates that the United States may eventually recognize the Soviet gains, as the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty contains formal diplomatic elements. It is generally recalled that the United States did not recognize Italy's conquest of Abyssinia and Albania, Germany's occupation of Czechoslovakia, Austria, Poland, Danzig, and Memel, or the Soviet Union's seizure of eastern Poland. At the same time, Secretary of State Hull indicated that he would soon issue a statement regarding the Finnish peace. It is widely believed that the State Department will be forced to revise its diplomatic policy to address the new European issues. Observers generally feel that the policy of moral embargo on arms to the Soviet Union will need to be reconsidered. Jesse Jones, Chairman of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, stated that the remaining portion of the US$10 million credit recently extended to Finland by the Export-Import Bank will be used for postwar reconstruction and refugee relief work. Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated, "The Soviet-Finnish peace is unrelated to us." Some members of Congress view the Soviet-Finnish peace as a victory for Hitler. (United Press dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>New York: Finnish President Kallio yesterday telegraphed former US President Hoover, stating that Finland had "signed forced peace terms." He requested Hoover to continue his efforts in the United States to alleviate the difficulties of the Finnish people. Hoover replied, stating that he would do his utmost to assist Finland. (United Press dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington: Diplomatic circles state that the US government, at the beginning of the Soviet-Finnish war, imposed a "moral embargo" on the Soviet Union. Although the two countries have now established a peace treaty, the embargo should be maintained, at least until the United States clarifies its attitude toward various small countries, before further consideration. The US Federal Export-Import Bank's previously decided credit line of US$20 million to Finland will not be cancelled, so that the country can use it for reconstruction work. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Soviet-Finnish Armistice: No Loss to Britain and France; Germany Claims Allied Failure; London Does Not Acknowledge</h3>
<p>London: Reuters diplomatic correspondent reports that well-informed circles in London are taking a broad view of the end of the Soviet-Finnish war and do not acknowledge the claim made by Germany and pro-German newspapers that this represents a failure on the part of the Allies. It is true that small countries are forced by circumstances to accept the demands of powerful neighbors, and that the principle of solidarity among small countries has suffered a blow as a result. However, in practical terms, the Allies have suffered no loss. Although the Allies had made arrangements to send troops to aid Finland, the governments of Norway and Sweden expressed their disagreement, and Finland did not issue a direct appeal, resulting in the failure of the Allied troop deployment plan. The result was very unfavorable to Finland, but the Allies did not suffer any losses. Furthermore, the various military supplies that the Allies were constantly supplying to Finland can now be retained for their own use. Now that the Soviet Union no longer needs to devote its strength to a war of attrition, it can provide more economic assistance to Germany. However, the Soviet Union suffered significant losses in the war against Finland, and it will take time to recover, leaving no spare capacity to attend to other matters. Furthermore, there is no mutual assistance pact between the Soviet Union and Germany; all that exists is a non-aggression treaty. Although Germany hopes to obtain more supplies of oil, food, and raw materials from the Soviet Union, those familiar with the situation in Moscow are certain that the Soviet Union is primarily concerned with its own interests, not those of Germany.

<h3>Danish Newspaper Reports News from Helsinki: Kuusinen Executed</h3>
<p>Copenhagen: According to news from Helsinki carried by this newspaper, Otto Kuusinen, the head of the Finnish puppet government established in Terijoki at the beginning of the Soviet-Finnish war, has been executed.

Stalin was reportedly enraged by Kuusinen's advice to launch an adventurous action against Finland to save the Finnish people from Mannerheim's control, as the outcome was contrary to his judgment. He personally ordered Kuusinen's execution. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>Paris: US Undersecretary of State Welles arrived here by plane from London on Sunday afternoon in order to travel on to Rome before returning home. British Ambassador to France Sir Ronald Campbell, US Chargé d'Affaires to France Mr. Murphy, and many other dignitaries welcomed him at the airport. After disembarking, Welles was accompanied by Murphy to meet with Prime Minister Daladier for a conversation lasting thirty minutes. Afterwards, when reporters asked him to express his feelings about the trip, he replied, "No comment." (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>London: US Undersecretary of State Welles met with Lloyd George, the British Prime Minister during the last World War, for eighty minutes yesterday. At the same time, British Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler denied in the House of Commons yesterday that Welles had submitted a memorandum to the British government outlining US foreign and economic policies. (Associated Press dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>London: US Assistant Secretary of State Welles spent four busy days in the UK, meeting with numerous British government officials and political leaders. He departed for Paris today and will meet with Mussolini and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano in Rome before returning to Washington around the end of January. According to Reuters diplomatic reporters, the main feature of Welles' report to President Roosevelt will be a repeated statement of the outlines of the minimum peace terms that the Allies and Germany might accept, as well as Italy's postwar desires. Many neutral country reporters traveling with Welles believe that the information he has collected seems likely to lead President Roosevelt to appeal for peace negotiations. However, when assessing the feasibility of this action, the impact on the US domestic and political situation must also be taken into account. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Milan: According to the "Popolo d'Italia"'s correspondent in London, British political figures hope that the United States will launch a peace offensive. It is widely rumored that after US Undersecretary of State Welles returns home, the United States will put forward concrete peace proposals. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>London: US President's envoy, Undersecretary of State Welles, accompanied by US Ambassador Kennedy, has departed from here today after holding final talks with British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax. A tragic peace initiative has also come to an end with Welles' departure from Europe. Welles saw no glimmer of hope for peace in Europe. What he can report to President Roosevelt is a terrifying picture: both sides of the European warring nations are stubbornly clinging to the current stalemate and will not give up until one side is exhausted and defeated. In the past 24 hours, the reaction in London to Welles' visit has undergone a complete transformation, even giving him the nickname "busybody." The Daily Mail commented on Welles' trip, "We are fighting for our survival and do not want to be dissuaded by silver-tongued people." The influential Daily Mail also stated bluntly on the front page that Welles' visit to Europe was related to Roosevelt's own government's future. Two weeks ago, general hopes here were high, but now those hopes have gone with Welles and seem to have been replaced by open and unhidden suspicion. When Welles was treated by senior officials, what he heard was, of course, only the most careful comments. If Welles could have immersed himself among the people, he would have seen the anti-American sentiment that is rising. As far as reporters know, the attitude of Britain towards the US in 1916 seems to be reviving. There is now a widespread opinion here that the United States is reaping huge profits, playing the role of Shylock. Although US Ambassador Kennedy has tried hard to dispel this rumor, this opinion has not only not disappeared, but is also spreading. Even the learned are becoming increasingly critical of the United States. An important official told a reporter, "Britain does not mind that the United States does not join the war, but the fact that the United States misunderstands Britain's motives for fighting cannot but make the British people feel uneasy." The British people are now gritting their teeth, determined to fight the war to the end, no matter how great the cost or how long it takes, until final victory is achieved. There is not a single person who does not hold this attitude. Therefore, given the current situation, unless Hitler completely surrenders, the British will never rest. The attitude of France is the same. Germany is now overflowing with resources and seems able to generously take advantage, but the US State Department and its envoy Welles can only obtain pessimism from Hitler. If President Roosevelt's decision to run for a third term depends on Welles' report, then please Roosevelt make a decision immediately. As for the realization of peace, it seems that the earliest hope will be this winter, but if a great war breaks out this spring and summer, then the prospects for peace will certainly be even more distant. From the Near East to London, reporters have heard calls for peace along the way, but what they have seen here is an unbreakable hatred, with the strong implication that "not showing sympathy is tantamount to hostility."

<h3>US Aircraft Export Issues</h3>
<p>Washington: The US House Armed Services Committee yesterday investigated the issue of aircraft purchases from the United States by Britain and France. According to well-informed sources, the committee will first seek the opinion of Secretary of War Woodring. The committee took this action because Britain and France requested to order large quantities of aircraft, citing that their own aircraft production capacity was not as great as Germany's. Senator Thomas offered to investigate rumors about how this aircraft order would affect the US military preparedness plan. Undersecretary of War Johnson also opposed divulging military secrets to the Allies. President Roosevelt has convened a Cabinet meeting, chaired by Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau, to reconcile the views of various departments. Roosevelt, Woodring, Johnson, and Secretary of the Navy Edison all participated. According to the Secretary of the Navy, the British order for aircraft does not hinder the US military preparedness plan, and military secrets will not be leaked. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington: The House Military Subcommittee began reviewing the government's policy of supplying military aircraft to the Allies today. Secretary of War Woodring will be the first to express the government's views. Yesterday, President Roosevelt consulted with aviation experts in the Defense Department on the extent to which the United States must fulfill foreign orders in order to help increase the United States' ability to build aircraft, thereby strengthening national defense. Undersecretary of War Johnson told news reporters that he strongly opposed setting aside US orders and trying his best to fulfill Allied orders. The United States has signed a contract to supply foreign countries with the Curtis P-40 fighter, which is indeed very superior. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Military Backing of the British Empire; Eden Issues Statement</h3>
<p>London: Dominions Secretary Eden stated today at a gathering of the Foreign Press Association that the assistance the British Empire is now receiving is unparalleled in history. When this assistance is fully utilized, it will have a decisive impact on the war situation. The British Empire Air Training Plan is now in full implementation, and it is estimated that no fewer than 50,000 pilots, airmen, and observers can be trained each year. The Australian Navy has left its homeland and is taking on part of the responsibilities at sea. He felt that when he met with Hitler previously, Hitler was constitutionally unable to understand the psychological and spiritual workings of a free democratic country. No matter how the war progresses, there can be no hesitation or compromise at this time. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>German Coal Sufficient for Italian Consumption</h3>
<p>Rome: After Italy and Germany concluded an agreement on coal, Italy obtained one million tons of coal per month from Germany, totaling twelve million tons per year. Thereafter, all of it was transported by rail. With this German coal, combined with domestic coal production, Italy has enough for its own consumption and does not need to rely on British coal or buy coal from the United States. According to informed sources, after Italy purchases additional coal from Germany, the quantity of agricultural products and food exported to Germany will certainly increase to pay for the coal. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The "Völkischer Beobachter" commented on the German-Italian coal transportation agreement in this morning's article, stating briefly that Germany is now transporting coal to Italy by land, which is a blow to Britain's attempt to force Italy to make concessions at sea.

Today, Germany has become Italy's sole supplier of coal, and economic cooperation is extremely close. Italy no longer needs to seek fuel from other countries. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>Zhu Jiahua Discusses the European War: Not Unfavorable to China; Chinese Diplomacy Can Maneuver with Ease and Bears an Important Mission for World Peace</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Correspondence) Dr. Zhu Jiahua, Minister of Organization of the Central Party Headquarters and Vice President of the Chinese Branch of the League of Nations Union, is an expert on international affairs. Recently, at the invitation of Chongqing University, he gave a speech on "Impressions of the European War." Mr. Zhu used statistical figures to deduce the future of the European war. His conclusion elaborated that the European war is not unfavorable to China. The full text is extremely insightful and has been personally proofread by Mr. Zhu. It is essential reading for those who care about the global situation. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>1.  The Origin of the War</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European War, although the front line has only seen skirmishes, forming a stalemate, judging from the trend, no matter how hard various parties mediating for peace try, the issue of war and peace in Europe is still unclear for the time being.</p>
<p>In the last World War, the belligerent countries sacrificed nearly 20 million lives and countless sums of money to obtain the Treaty of Versailles. Having learned from pain, Europeans cherish the peace treaty obtained at such a high price. European politicians have been painstakingly trying to maintain the treaty while avoiding unfortunate events that frequently arise from it as a starting point. However, the Treaty of Versailles, achieved through numerous hardships, only barely supported the peace that everyone admired for twenty years before throwing the war-weary people of Europe back into the embrace of the god of war.</p>
<p>The reason for the outbreak of the last war was that the national policies of various countries were influenced by the expansion of production, leading to a scramble for colonies, raw materials, and markets. The famous Prussian military scholar Clausewitz once said, "War is a continuation of politics." The evolution of European politics had reached a point where it could not advance any further, so they did not hesitate to use war to alleviate political difficulties, resulting in an unprecedented tragedy in history. In 1919, when everyone gathered in Versailles, they each harbored fears about the future, believing that as long as they restrained the defeated countries and prevented them from retaliating, future wars could be avoided. Therefore, the root causes of the outbreak of the 1914 war were not thoroughly examined or eliminated, so the Treaty of Versailles could not establish a foundation for lasting peace. Moreover, because the politicians after the war still clung to old ideas and did not seek change, they did not adopt new opinions to solve new problems.</p>
<p>The so-called new problem is the increasingly excessive production that comes with post-war recovery and prosperity. The so-called new idea is to abandon the scramble for resources and markets and, based on the spirit of international technical cooperation, jointly develop underdeveloped areas to absorb and solve all surpluses. This was the original suggestion of our Premier Sun Yat-sen. In his "Industrial Plan," Sun Yat-sen said, "Recent world wars have proven that humanity suffers from war, whether victorious or defeated, and the instigators suffer even more. This is true for those who fight with force, and even more so for those who compete with trade. President Wilson has already established the League of Nations to prevent future wars of force. I would like to further promote international cooperation to develop China, so as to avoid future trade wars. In this way, the greatest cause of future wars can be fundamentally eliminated." Such profound words, a good contribution to world peace, have been consistently upheld by China. The Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee last year reiterated and clarified them. Unfortunately, few listened. For twenty years, European politicians failed to pay attention, leading Europe to repeat its mistakes and resort to arms again.</p>
<p>2.  Strategy</p>
<p>At the beginning of this European War, some people overestimated the power of scientific weapons, believing that once the belligerent countries came into contact, there would be a very fierce large-scale battle immediately, and that European culture would inevitably be destroyed. However, this is not the case in reality. The facts of the past six months tell us that the belligerent countries are both adopting a strategy of attrition, rather than a blitzkrieg of annihilation. What is most noteworthy is that they focus on naval and air warfare, remaining entrenched on land. This can be said to have created a new record in war history. From the beginning of the war until now, it can be said that "there is no war on the Western Front," with no trench warfare, let alone a main force battle of general attack.</p>
<p>So why is the strategy of attrition adopted by both belligerent countries this time more thorough than that adopted in the second half of the last war? This naturally stems from the lessons learned from the last war. People know that the reason why Germany failed last time was due to insufficient economic strength. Clausewitz also said, "War is a political game played with different tools." Today, we may say that "war is an economic competition of weapons." Therefore, if we want to understand the strategies of both belligerent countries and predict the way out of this war, then we should start by analyzing the economic status quo of each belligerent country, so as not to deviate too far from the facts.

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government: Coordinating Freight Transport and Regulating People's Livelihood; Organizing a Trade Commission as a Specialized Agency</h3>
<p>Xinghua Correspondence: In order to collect materials, coordinate freight transport, and regulate the people's livelihood, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has specially organized the Jiangsu Provincial Trade Commission to handle matters related to unified enterprise, transportation, and trust.

Offices are also established in the locations of the provincial government and administrative offices to facilitate trade connections. It is reported that the commission's trade funds are provided by the provincial government, but are settled monthly, with 80% of the profits turned over to the provincial treasury, and the remainder used as public reserve funds and employee bonuses. These measures are currently being submitted to the Provincial Government Committee for approval and reported to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs for record.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchant Shisu Prepares to Open a Silk Factory, Sericulture Industry Will Be Completely Seized</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: The southwestern townships of this county, including Mudu, Guangfu, Xiangshan, Hengjing, Dongshan, Huguan, Wangting, Dongqiao, Huangdai, etc., have traditionally been sericulture areas. Before the war, the Wuxian County Government specially established a Sericulture Guidance Association, sending experts to guide farmers to improve silkworm rearing methods. Over the years, the total output has reached more than 20,000 dan for the entire county, accounting for more than 30% of the province's output. After the fall of the area, most of the mulberry trees in the sericulture areas were cut down by the Japanese army for fuel, causing the sericulture industry to plummet. Last spring, some farmers, forced by livelihood, continued to plant mulberry trees and raise silkworms, but as a result, due to the Japanese manipulation of market prices, they did not benefit much. Many even suffered losses due to the high price of mulberry trees. At the end of last month, a large number of Japanese people came to Suzhou from Shanghai, surveying sites in the Panmen and Xudou areas, preparing to open a silk factory, and bringing 50,000 sheets of Japanese silkworm eggs, colluding with puppet police, and going to various villages to force farmers to buy them. It is reported that the price is 1.5 Japanese yen, and it is stipulated that the farmers who buy the silkworm eggs must sell all the fresh cocoons to the Japanese factory in the future. At the same time, the Japanese intelligence agency also notified the fresh cocoon market from the beginning of this month to close immediately. Therefore, in the future, the sericulture industry in this county will be completely seized by the Japanese.</p>

<h3>Founder of Scouting, Baden-Powell, Passes Away; China Scout Association Sends Condolences by Telegram</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Aviation News) Lord Baden-Powell, the founder of the Boy Scouts, passed away in Africa last year at the age of 83. The China Scout Association recently received a letter of condolences from the International Scout Bureau, and Chairman Chen Lifu has sent a letter on behalf of the national male and female scouts to express condolences and to comfort his family.</p>
<p>It is reported that Baden-Powell was a British Londoner who joined the army at the age of 19, held important military positions, and rose to the rank of Lieutenant General and Cavalry Inspector General. In the summer of 1907, Baden-Powell selected more than 20 children on Brownsea Island for outdoor camping, teaching them various knowledge of daily life, with great success. This was the first Scout troop in the world. The following year, he published the book "Scouting for Boys," which became popular throughout the country. The Scout movement then developed rapidly in England and gradually spread to the world. In 1910, he resigned from all military positions and devoted himself to this cause. In 1909, he developed the Girl Scout organization. In 1916, he founded the Cub Scouts. In 1918, he started Rover Scout training. In 1929, he was awarded the title of Marquess by the King of England for his meritorious service in founding Scout education.</p>
<p>The aim of Scout education is to utilize the lively and active nature of young children, focusing on outdoor activities, imparting common sense, promoting handicrafts, strengthening physical fitness, cultivating character, and promoting patriotic ideas. It has the basic values of general education, so various countries have adopted it one after another, integrating its organization and training principles into national policies to cultivate the youth and children of their own countries into healthy citizens. There are now Scout organizations in 50 countries around the world, with more than 3 million members.</p>
<p>Baden-Powell devoted himself to Scout education for more than 30 years, publishing 28 kinds of works. He usually advocated that young people of all countries should be friendly and kind to each other in order to establish a foundation for world peace, sparing no effort, and his contribution to the world is very great.</p>

Recently, due to a sharp increase in the number of students to 900, more classes have been added, professors have been hired, and various practical training facilities have been strengthened. Last year, 150 graduates of the institute were all hired by production agencies in various places. The departments of Mechanical Engineering, Aeronautics, Mining and Metallurgy, and Textile Engineering are especially in short supply. This year, there are 160 graduates. In order to meet the needs of the country next year, it is planned to increase the number of new students in Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering by one class each, and to add a vocational training course in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering. Yesterday, the alumni association of the institute in Chongqing hosted a banquet for Lai Lian at Lao Wanquan. It is reported that Lai will return to school in a few days.</p>
<h3>Survey of Secondary Schools in Sichuan Province: There are a Total of 189 Secondary Schools</h3>

<h3>Women's YMCA Ping Pong Team Wins New Six Cup Spirit Award; Captain Huang Tongyin's Spirit is Commendable</h3>
<p>The Women's YMCA at 999 Jing'an Temple Road in this city has participated in the Second New Six Cup Team Ping Pong League since its organization in order to improve its skills. The team has a total of ten members, with Huang Tongyin as the captain. The competition has been going on for more than two months and twenty-four matches have been completed. Because of its consistent efforts, the team won the "Spirit Award" presented by the New Six Cup Committee, which is quite an honor. Chen Linsheng, the leader of the team, believes that Huang's dedication to her duties and her spirit of service are rare among women. In addition to holding regular慰劳meetings, he specially wrote words of encouragement to show encouragement. Huang Tongyin is a woman who is enthusiastic and determined to promote women's ping pong. When she was the captain of the Women's YMCA ping pong team and attended the New Six Cup Ping Pong Championship, she always led the entire team to arrive on time, even in wind and rain. This lasted for about a month, and finally enabled the Women's YMCA team to win the Spirit Award in the league because it never gave up. This is all due to Huang's courage and responsibility. Ms. Huang is studying obstetrics and gynecology at the China-Germany Hospital and is about to graduate. It is expected that after her internship period, she will put her courageous spirit into serving the society, and she will definitely make great achievements in public welfare.</p>

<h3>Rice and Coal Price Stabilization Measures: French Concession Approves Plan, Submits to French Consul-General for Implementation; Two Concessions to Take Joint Action Within Days</h3>
<p>The French Concession Price Stabilization Committee held its second plenary session on March 13 in the French Municipal Council's assembly hall. The various subcommittees formed on February 29 reportedly submitted reports on the situation of rice, coal, and all essential goods. It is now reported that after discussion, the committee passed effective measures, which will be submitted to the French Consul-General for implementation.</p>
<p>Causes of Rising Prices Summarized</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, the meeting's content involved the subcommittees submitting reports summarizing their investigations to Eugène, Chairman of the Price Stabilization Committee, and conducting discussions on general price issues. It is said that the causes of the current price increases, according to the investigation results of each group, can be summarized into three factors: speculative manipulation, supply difficulties, and exchange rate relations. Except for the exchange rate factor, which is a financial problem that cannot be solved independently, efforts will be made to resolve the remaining causes of price increases as soon as possible. The content of the reports prepared by the two subcommittees and the general effective measures proposed to suppress and stabilize prices have been submitted to the French Consul-General for approval and implementation. Although the Public Concession authorities did not send representatives to the subcommittee meeting the day before yesterday, the opinions of the two Concession authorities are completely consistent and maintain close contact. It is reported that the two Concession authorities will jointly negotiate specific measures to suppress and stabilize prices, and will take consistent and effective steps to resolve the causes of speculative manipulation and supply difficulties that have led to price increases.</p>
<p>Two Concessions to Take Joint Action</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the French Concession Price Stabilization Committee held a plenary meeting on the 13th, and the subcommittees investigating rice, coal, flour, and other daily necessities submitted their reports, and immediately passed a resolution to be submitted to the French Consul-General. Once the French authorities have agreed on joint measures with the Public Concession Works Department, they will be implemented. It is reported that the two Concession authorities will be able to take joint action within days.</p>
<p>Hoping for Public Supervision</p>
<p>The high price wave in this city threatens the livelihood of the entire citizenry. Since the French Concession Municipal Council and the Public Concession Works Department have successively established special committees to conduct research and investigations, the soaring prices have been significantly curbed. The Works Department has also formally announced strict measures to crack down on hoarding and manipulation, and will prosecute and punish those who seek profit without regard for the people's hardships according to law. Public organizations such as the Shanghai Citizens' Association are hoping that citizens, with their own interests at stake, will jointly supervise and report to the authorities as much as possible if they find out about hoarding and manipulation. In addition, trade associations in various industries have also begun to assist the authorities in adjusting prices in the same industry, because if things go to extremes, those who suffer in the future may still be the industries themselves. Thanks to the cooperation of all parties, the trend of rising prices can be curbed.</p>

<h3>Further Arrival of About 40,000 Bags of Foreign Rice; No More Under-the-Table Transactions; Domestic Rice Also Transported to Shanghai from Inland Ports; Owners Eager to Sell, Prices Continue to Drop by About One Yuan</h3>
<p>The French Mail Steamship Company's regular mail ship "Chafei" (霞飛), which started from Marseilles and sailed to the Far East this time, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, but it is now learned that it arrived earlier at about 9:00 a.m. the day before yesterday (the 13th), and sailed to the Hongkou Gonghexiang Wharf at noon to dock. The ship loaded more than 38,000 bags of foreign rice via Saigon. It has been unloaded yesterday and is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Japan this morning. It will return to Shanghai around the end of the month to return to Europe. Jardine Matheson's "Yongsheng" (永生) vessel arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong the day before yesterday and also transported 1,617 bags of foreign rice, which were unloaded at the Roosevelt Wharf warehouse. It is reported that the ship also has 177 bags of Indian rice and 994 bags of Tianjin rice, which are all on board. It is scheduled to set sail and transport to Yantai and Tianjin tomorrow.</p>
<p>Rice Market Closely Supervised</p>
<p>The authorities of the two Concessions are actively working to suppress the prices in this city, and are paying special attention to the people's food. Supervisors appointed by the authorities are stationed in the rice industry tea market regularly, working closely with the market management committee to monitor the market's operations and report the number of transactions and actual sales in the market to the authorities on a daily basis for verification. The practice of various rice merchants evading registration and engaging in under-the-table transactions in the past has not been discovered for a long time.</p>
<p>Supply Exceeds Demand, Rice Prices Continue to Fall</p>
<p>In addition to the arrival of about 40,000 bags of foreign rice mentioned above, 2,700 to 800 bags of domestic rice were also transported from inland ports. Under the circumstances of sufficient inventory and owners urgently seeking to sell, rice prices continued to fall by about one yuan yesterday. Saigon No. 1 rice is now at 43 yuan in national currency, a difference of 12 to 13 yuan compared to the highest price of rice.</p>
<h3>Jesson Dockyard Workers Strike; Three Russian Police Injured</h3>
<p>At 3:10 p.m. yesterday, workers at the Jesson &amp; Co. dockyard at 614 Yangshupu Road suddenly went on strike. The Central and Huishan police departments immediately sent more than 50 police officers to suppress the strike, but when they arrived at the factory, three Russian police officers had already been seriously injured. It is reported that a total of more than 500 people participated in the strike. As for the demands made by the workers, according to Mr. Bonner, the factory manager, last night, it is not yet known, because they are engaged in negotiations with the workers' representatives. According to another source, the workers put forward a total of nine conditions, the most important of which are wage increases and rice subsidies. The workers unanimously resolved yesterday that if the demands are not fully accepted by the factory, they will refuse any mediation. It is understood that at 6 p.m. yesterday, more than 500 workers gathered in the factory to wait for a solution. Subsequently, the police repeatedly persuaded them before they dispersed.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Agrees with Yitaixing Company to Supply Price-Controlled Coal Ash; Daily Supply of 57 Tons Allocated to 16 Factories; Coal Briquette Warehouse Receipts to be Cleared Today Without Extension</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of the price-controlled sale of coal briquettes, although each person is limited to buying 20 cents worth, buyers still flock to buy them, greatly benefiting the common people. However, due to the high price of raw materials (coal ash), a request was made to Mr. Yu Qiaqing to find a way to reduce shipping costs. More than ten days have passed, and no definite news has been received. Now, in order to remedy the situation, the small coal briquette factories have asked the Public Association to find a way to suppress the market price of coal ash. The association immediately sent Chen Cuifang, Huang Yuxiu, Xue Bofang, and Zhou Baosun to the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce yesterday to make a request for assistance. The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce agreed to convene representatives of various coal ash dealers on the 16th of this month to discuss appropriate measures to provide assistance so that the small coal briquette factories can continue to ship goods and supply the market.</p>
<p>Price-Controlled Period</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce of the Coal Briquette Industry, saying: "We are writing to inform you that in order to maintain coal briquette production, eliminate panic, and provide relief to small coal briquette factories, from today until the 31st of this month, please have the Yitaixing Coal Company supply 57 tons of price-controlled coal ash daily according to the regulations, and allocate it to 16 factories. Enclosed is a list of factories and tonnage allocations. We hope that your association will quickly inform the factories to contact Yitaixing Coal Company for processing. This is of utmost importance. Sincerely."</p>
<p>Allocation Methods</p>
<p>The following methods have been established for remedying the small coal briquette factories: (1) Factories without inventory should check the actual daily production and supply tonnage. If more purchases are required, they should be calculated at market prices. (2) Purchase spot goods for cash on a daily basis, and warehouse receipts will not be issued. (3) Hongji No. 2 ash will be reduced by 10 yuan in legal currency per ton at market price (i.e., 100 yuan per ton) until the end of March in the lunar calendar. (4) Those who have not cleared their low-price coal ash warehouse receipts or who have repeatedly failed to repay their loans will not be supplied. (5) Coal ash purchased previously will not be returned.</p>
<p>Warehouse Goods Cleared</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce had previously convened a meeting with coal industry-related organizations to urge all coal briquette warehouse receipt holders to ship goods within a time limit so that there would be more spot goods on the market. It was decided that the deadline would be on the 15th of this month. Since the announcement, many warehouse receipt holders have gone to ship goods, but a few have still not done so. The industry association has decided not to extend the deadline any further and will end it today. A reporter from the Xin Sheng Bao learned from the industry association yesterday that those warehouse receipt holders who still fail to ship goods in accordance with the regulations today will be severely punished after public discussion as a warning to others.</p>
<p>Boiled Water Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Boiled Water Industry Association held a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees yesterday afternoon at 7 p.m. Chairman Zhang Delong reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating that in order to take into account the livelihood of the poor and social security, the industry has resumed selling water, enduring pain and making sacrifices. However, the way to remedy the situation lies in suppressing the market price of coal ash, so it is proposed to continue to negotiate with the Mining Bureau to supply coal for fuel at low prices. All the attending committee members unanimously agreed. As for the various proposals, they will be formally announced today.</p>
<h3>Works Department Chief of Finance Talks; Increase in Surtax Difficult to Stop; Cites Various Benefits for Chinese; Does Not Discuss Citizen Affordability</h3>
<p>Mr. Mauger, the chief of finance of the Works Department, gave a speech at the Rotary Club in the Capital Hotel yesterday, stating that the recent opposition from all walks of life to the Works Department's decision to increase the municipal surtax was due to the fact that they were not aware of the increase in various demands made on the Works Department by all walks of life in recent years. The Works Department's various measures for the Chinese and Japanese in this port in recent years are countless, and the strongest opposition to the decision to increase the municipal surtax by 50% from July 1 is from the Chinese and Japanese, which makes it difficult for him to understand. Mr. Mauger continued to say that when the Chinese government withdrew from Shanghai, the Works Department took over the prisoners in various prisons on its behalf, and the various facilities for Chinese education are also too numerous to mention. As far as the current municipal surtax policy of the two Concessions is concerned, there are indeed differences, because the Works Department adopts the so-called "colonial divisional regime," while the French Municipal Council adopts a completely "democratic regime." As far as the current year's budget is concerned, the expenditure of the Public Concession has increased by a total of 7 million yuan due to the above-mentioned requirements, of which 3,157,190 yuan is used for education, 2,722,190 yuan is used for prisons, and 1,190,430 yuan is used for commercial groups. As for the French Concession, this kind of expenditure is greatly reduced. If all the expenses of the fire brigade and the police station are added to it, the number will be even greater.</p>

<h3>Post Office Designated as Restricted Area; Great Inconvenience to the Public; Vehicles Carrying Mail Cannot Cross Bridge; Parcel Printing Plans to Relocate for the Better</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Postal Administration Building was designated as a restricted area in Hongkou by the Japanese on the day of the incident, the public has suffered mental pain and inconvenience in their actions when going to the bureau to post mail. The following is a record of the various situations:</p>
<p>Extreme Inconvenience to the Public</p>
<p>Since the Japanese side, in the name of the "Concession Forces Command," extended the wire mesh from North Sichuan Road to the bridgehead of the Waterworks Bridge, and the road along North Suzhou Road to the north bridgehead of the Sichuan Road Bridge of the Postal Administration was suddenly cut off, those who went to the bureau had to detour through the Sichuan Road Bridge, which caused extreme inconvenience to the public posting mail.</p>
<p>No Results from Negotiations</p>
<p>After the above-mentioned incident occurred, although Shanghai Postmaster General [unclear] specifically dispatched Japanese Deputy Postmaster General Kanesashi Ichiro to negotiate with the Japanese Consulate and other relevant parties, the Japanese side used the excuse that the area north of Suzhou Creek, west from North Henan Road, was its defense zone, and there were no results.</p>
<p>Must Pass Through Japanese Military Outpost</p>
<p>The inconvenience to the public caused by the Postal Administration Building being designated as a restricted area is evident in that, in addition to having to pass in front of the Japanese soldiers' outpost when going to the Administration Building to post mail, heavy items such as parcels and printed matter, which must be transported by vehicles, generally have to detour through the Zha Pu Road Bridge.</p>
<p>Vehicles Cannot Cross the Bridge</p>
<p>Not only that, but all vehicles carrying mail, whether for business trips or moving equipment, including cars and rickshaws, cannot pass through the north of the bridge. Therefore, the senders had to find a way to carry the mail back and forth across the bridge by hand, and then hire a car to send it to the bureau, which is how inconvenient the transportation is.</p>
<p>Japanese Blame Car Dealers</p>
<p>According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the Shanghai Postal Administration also raised the above-mentioned facts of inconvenience with the Japanese side, but the Japanese side said that the reason why vehicles cannot load and wait for mail to cross the bridge is due to the North District car dealers' discrimination against business competition, and it is not the intention of the Japanese side.</p>

<h3>No Definite News on Cancellation of "Passes" in Nanshi</h3>
<p>There have been rumors in Nanshi for days that the Japanese side will cancel the so-called "passes" from today (the 15th) in order to "prosper the market," but as of last night, this rumor has not been confirmed.

<h3>American Journalist Talks About Deteriorating Relations Between Japan and the United States; No Improvement Possible in the Near or Distant Future; Japanese Farmers Forced to Manufacture Cannons</h3>
<p>James A. Michener, editor of Collier's magazine, who once came to China in 1937 to investigate the Sino-Japanese war, recently went to India with his wife from Manila, intending to stay there for three weeks to investigate the current situation there and the impact of the European war. When [Mr. Michener] made a stopover in Shanghai on his way to Manila, he went ashore for sightseeing. In 1927, the American warship Panay was bombed. His wife happened to be on the ship and witnessed the brutality of the Japanese aircraft. When Mr. Michener was residing in Japan, he wrote an article published in a Manila newspaper, believing that the reason why the Japanese-American Treaty of Commerce and Navigation could not be renewed was entirely due to Japan's face-saving considerations and its unwillingness to yield to the United States. He believes that there is no possibility of improvement in Japanese-American business relations in the near or distant future. He has a detailed observation of the Japanese government's planned control. He said that Japan began to implement this plan as early as two years ago. By next spring, he expects that even Japanese farmers who work ten hours a day in the fields will be forced to manufacture aircraft or cannons in factories set up by the state. At present, Japan is extremely short of salt, sugar, gasoline, and other daily necessities. There are very few cars on the road, because the government has banned unnecessary gasoline consumption.</p>

It is understood that Mr. Gauss had been ordered to be transferred to the US Consul General to Australia long ago, but the order to leave Shanghai and take office had not yet arrived in Shanghai, so he has not yet made the trip. According to reliable sources, Mr. Gauss recently had a meeting with Admiral Hart, Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, and made a decision on the US's position in the Pacific. Mr. Gauss's trip to Australia will be to implement the results of their discussions.</p>
<p>Reluctant to Leave After Many Years in China</p>
<p>According to a US Consulate official, Consul General Gauss has become an important figure in the Far East since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, and has been working diligently day and night, with almost no time to spare, which is truly admirable. Since 1906, he has been working for the government, serving in Washington and Paris for several years before being sent to China, where he has been for 33 years. During this period, due to his duties, he has traveled all over China, from Shanghai, Tianjin, Xiamen, Jinan, Shenyang, and Peiping, and finally transferred from Peiping to Shanghai. Now he is leaving Shanghai for Australia, so he really feels reluctant to leave this second home.</p>
<h3>Edison Bulb Factory Labor Strike Resolved</h3>

<h3>Refugee Association Writes to Various Industries, Continuing to Solicit Donations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association previously launched a fundraising campaign because refugees from the occupied areas gathered in Shanghai, in order to provide long-term support. Leaders in various industries in the city, in the spirit of human mutual assistance, have been working hard on this fundraising campaign. Since its inception, it has achieved remarkable results. However, the association had previously notified various industries that there were regulations on the deadline for donations. It is now learned that the deadline will expire in turn, and [the disaster] continues to rise, causing general refugees to be unable to reflect on life.

It specifically notified various industries the day before yesterday to continue to raise donations in order to implement the original intention of providing disaster relief.</p>
<h3>Twenty Gambling Dens in West Shanghai May Close; Date is the 20th of this Month</h3>
<p>The Continental News reported that it is heard that gambling dens in West Shanghai are currently paying heavy donations in order to obtain a business license. However, these 20 gambling dens will be closed on the 20th. But every time the closure period approaches, the gambling dens pay huge sums of money to survive. On the 10th of this month, the gambling dens were closed for one day, but 20 of the 23 gambling dens each paid 20,000 yuan and were able to continue operating. The donation fee for the gambling dens is approximately 500,000 yuan per month.</p>
<p>(Another report) The problem of the closure and survival of large and small gambling dens in the extra-settlement road area of ​​West Shanghai, according to the person in charge, has the possibility of closing on the 20th of this month. According to reports, the 20 large gambling dens in the "badlands" are currently open as usual, but they will also announce their closure before the 20th. The rumor that they were closed on Tuesday night is inaccurate. There was a proposal to order them to close in the middle of last month. The owners of these gambling dens, seeing the "gambling dens" as the source of their lives, paid huge sums of money to maintain their business. On the 10th of this month, 20 gambling dens were closed for one night, but each gambling den paid 20,000 yuan. Since the Public Works Department and the puppet "municipal government" signed the Provisional Police Agreement on the extra-settlement road area of ​​West Shanghai on February 12, the new patrol team there will be established and patrol will be implemented. Therefore, all gambling dens may be closed on the 20th of this month, it is said.</p>

The police returned fire, and several shots were exchanged. A robber named Zhu Tianyuan, 27 years old, was shot and wounded on the spot, sustaining one bullet wound each to his right arm and left leg, and collapsed. He was arrested and taken to the police hospital for treatment. A stray bullet also struck a pedestrian named Lu Guojie, 30 years old, who lived nearby at number 41, in the leg.

<h3>China Relief Society Promotes Refugee Production Plan, Avoids Unnecessary Waste of Labor, Contributes to Wartime Production</h3>
<p>The Central Relief Committee believes that, among war-zone refugees, apart from a few who can support themselves, the majority, 80-90%, are unable to do so. How to resettle them long-term, prevent this large workforce from being wasted, and guide them to contribute to wartime production is a critical issue. It has been learned that the Committee, having considered previous refugee relief methods, has formulated a comprehensive refugee production plan and issued instructions to relevant agencies for active implementation. The content includes: (1) Concentrating agricultural talents from guerrilla areas to refugee-receiving regions to organize group farming, with the aim of collecting refugees, engaging in production, and stabilizing their lives. (2) Promoting and managing small business loans and land reclamation loans for refugees, and encouraging refugees to claim and cultivate wasteland. (3) Selecting appropriate locations to establish small-scale factories to provide work for refugees and achieve self-sufficiency (proposed factory types: earthwork factories, cloth shoe factories, thread sock factories, towel factories, small cotton textile factories). (4) Promoting and managing subsidies for land allocation and house construction to help refugees become self-reliant.</p>
<h3>Raw Materials for Biscuit and Bread Industry, Flour Mills to Provide as Much as Possible, Fuxin and Fu Already Agreed</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, based on the request of member factories and shops affiliated with the Biscuit, Candy, Canned Food, and Bread Industry Association of this city, which specialize in manufacturing biscuits and pastries for sale, totaling twenty-four establishments employing nearly ten thousand workers who depend on this for their livelihood, where large factories need about one hundred bags of flour daily and small factories need several bags daily, has observed that since the price of flour in the market has risen, the supply of raw materials has also been affected. If these factories are forced to suspend operations due to a lack of raw materials, it will inevitably disrupt social stability. Therefore, in accordance with the Association's request, it prepared a letter of introduction, and the Association dispatched personnel to negotiate directly with the Fuxin and Fu flour mills, requesting that they supply as much as possible at market prices, according to the required quantity, so that products can meet market demand without fear of shortage.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the editor: According to the client Zhang Ronghai, upon reading your newspaper's article "Unmarried Minor Woman's Inheritance Confirmed," which stated that Zhang Ronghai lives at No. 3, Jian'an Lane, Ximen Road, and runs a brothel, etc., this is incorrect. The undersigned previously served in the police and is currently an official. Both positions are highly respected and have nothing to do with running a brothel. Furthermore, since childhood, I have been raised as the son of the deceased Zhang Chunlin and his wife. Prior to this, Lin Gen, the adopted son of the deceased Chunlin Gong, and his wife, made a settlement with the entire Zhang family and their daughter Maotou in 1933. All of the above should be corrected in the form of a letter from a lawyer to correct the record. I request that the newspaper grant the correction. Sincerely, Lawyer Xu Wufang, March 13.</p>

<h3>Finance - Forward Foreign Exchange Tightens Across the Board, Spot Exchange Not Significantly Affected, HSBC Continues to Sell British Gold, US Exchange Tightens More Sharply Than British</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed prices. The black market for British and American exchange rates continued to soften, but the situation was very peculiar: HSBC was willing to supply spot exchange at a rate of 4 shillings 1.125, and the volume reached over 600,000 pounds, but due to tight credit, there were few spot buyers, and the price was not significantly affected. On the other hand, demand for forward exchange was high, and it continued to tighten. The April forward rate had already entered the 4-shilling barrier. Because the declines in US-British exchange rates were unexpected this morning, the opening price was only down by half a point. The opening price of US exchange was relatively hard, but Sassoon first absorbed it, followed by aggressive buying from Japanese banks and buying from Chinese banks, so the price gradually softened. Fortunately, HSBC supplied spot British gold as much as possible, so it was able to hold steady, while forward exchange followed and tightened slightly. By closing, British gold was still 4 shillings 1.125, and US exchange was only 6.375 yuan. After the afternoon, tightening continued, especially in forward exchange. However, HSBC continued to maintain spot British gold, so the momentum was slightly dampened. Therefore, the closing price of British gold was still 4 shillings 1.125, and US exchange had tightened to 6.34375 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous day, the British rate was flat and the US rate was tighter by 0.09375. The potential of forward exchange continued to diverge from spot exchange.</p>
<p>HSBC Sold 600,000 Pounds</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the London exchange rates for near and far months fell by 1.875 each. The New York silver price remained flat, and the London gold price remained stable. The exchange rates for British, American, Shanghai, and French exchange rates were all flat. The US exchange rate tightened by half a point against the British pound, fell by 0.2 yuan against Shanghai, and fell by a small amount against France. The central bank's listed prices for each exchange rate remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling price in the morning was 4 shillings 1.125 for British gold and 6.46875 yuan for US exchange, compared to the previous close, the British rate was flat and the US rate was looser by 0.03125. This was because the exchange rate decline was not significant. After the opening, Sassoon first absorbed spot US exchange at 6.46875 yuan. Following this, a certain bank absorbed HSBC spot British gold at 4 shillings 1.125. At this time, foreign banks were already interested in buying spot US exchange at 6.46875 yuan, so the market seemed stable but slightly soft. After the announcement that the HSBC listed prices remained unchanged and that the silver balancing tax was down 1.125 points, Japanese banks suddenly began aggressive buying, strongly absorbing HSBC spot British gold at 4 shillings 1.125 and foreign banks' May forward British gold at 4 shillings 0.015625, and May US exchange at 6.21875. Later, Chinese banks also followed in absorbing foreign banks' May US exchange at 6.40625. This created a steady situation with slight tightening. After 10:30 AM, Japanese banks resumed their activity, and Chinese banks continued to buy, and American banks also started to show buying interest, so the market suddenly tightened. Japanese banks closed in foreign banks' May US exchange at 6.1875, and American banks absorbed their May US exchange at 6.375. By closing, British gold was 4 shillings 1.125 and US exchange was 6.375. The May British gold was 4 shillings 0.09375 and US exchange was 6.34375, compared to the morning opening, the British rate was flat and the US rate was tighter by 0.09375.</p>
<p>April British Exchange Advances to 4 Shillings</p>
<p>The market initially opened flat, but then Japanese banks and speculators bought forward contracts, and some also closed positions, so the market continued to tighten. However, HSBC was still willing to supply current shillings, so it remained stable, but forward contracts tightened across the board. Foreign banks and Japanese banks closed in HSBC spot British gold at 4 shillings 1.125, totaling 200,000 pounds. A certain bank absorbed Chinese banks' April US exchange at 6.21875.

<h3>Another Surge in Rising Prices: New Gold Prices Emerge One After Another; Yesterday, the Top Price Soared to 5,145 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold market situation once again created a new historical gold price record. The gold rush was overwhelming, astonishing those who heard of it. The reason was that the exchange rate was tight, and a certain securities group continued to invest, coupled with the fact that operators in the government bond and stock markets were all concentrating on gold. Everyone believed that buying gold was the only way to preserve wealth, so the price could only rise and not fall. At its peak, it reached a high price of 5,145 yuan. At the closing bell, it was still 5,130 yuan. Regarding the situation of the day, the market opened sharply lower by 55 yuan in the morning due to the strong US dollar exchange rate and the selling by gold firms. Shortly after, the US dollar exchange rate rebounded, arousing excitement among the people. Retail investors bought heavily, and securities groups absorbed continuously. Hong Kong groups also entered the market at this time. Although there were also sellers, ultimately, due to the difficulty in balancing supply and demand, the flames of rising prices became unstoppable, reaching 5,080 yuan. Later, many who had made profits sold off, causing a pullback of 29 yuan. However, due to a sudden rush to purchase by gold firms, the price was raised again to 5,068 yuan. In the afternoon, various groups were searching for gold, once again pushing the price to a peak of 5,145 yuan. Although there was a slight setback later, buyers did not stop, so the result was a sharp increase of 135 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was approximately 4,000 taels. Gold jewelry in silver shops rose by 15 yuan, reaching a peak of 520 yuan. Customs gold and other types remained stable.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Jumps by Over 100 Yuan Again</p>
<p>Since the morning, the initial opening price per bar (ten taels) dropped sharply by 55 yuan due to the strong US dollar exchange rate and weak market sentiment. Gold firms and money exchange businesses sold to suppress prices, with gold firms selling 20 taels to silver firms at 4,940 yuan. Shortly after, the US dollar exchange rate suddenly rebounded, and buyers rushed in. Securities groups and retail investors bought at the low, pulling the price up by 55 yuan. Securities groups bought 10 taels from gold firms at 4,995 yuan. Subsequently, a certain silver firm and jewelry group sold, while gold firms also sold, suppressing the price by 33 yuan. Gold firms sold 50 taels to silver firms at 4,962 yuan. After that, the US dollar exchange rate suddenly softened, and it was reported that although spot gold was stable, futures were slightly tighter. Therefore, market sentiment recovered, and securities groups and a certain silver firm scrambled to buy. At the same time, Hong Kong groups also came to search for gold, coupled with retail investors following suit, resulting in a leap of 118 yuan. Silver firms bought 20 taels from jewelry groups at 5,080 yuan. Then, a certain jewelry group and securities group sold to realize profits, and buyers gradually decreased, causing a small pullback of 29 yuan. Silver firms traded 20 taels at 5,051 yuan. Near the closing bell, a certain gold firm suddenly came to purchase, raising the price by 19 yuan. Gold firms bought 50 taels from securities groups at 5,070 yuan. Following that, money exchange businesses sold 10 taels to silver firms at 5,068 yuan, as the afternoon closing price. The initial opening price in the afternoon was stable. Securities groups initially absorbed 50 taels from money exchange businesses, still at 5,068 yuan. Later, due to tight foreign exchange futures prices, securities groups, a certain silver firm, and gold firms rushed to buy. In addition, Hong Kong groups were also active. Soon, the price surged by 52 yuan, jumping beyond the 5,100 yuan mark. A certain jewelry group bought 50 taels from gold firms at 5,120 yuan. Afterwards, a certain gold firm exited the market with substantial profits, and Hong Kong groups ceased buying, causing a small pullback of 50 yuan. Securities groups traded 50 taels among themselves at 5,070 yuan. At that time, securities groups had strong buying interest and absorbed over 200 taels. Simultaneously, a certain money exchange business also came to buy, and as the exchange rate futures continued to soften, the price surged again by 75 yuan. Gold firms bought 30 taels from jewelry groups at 5,145 yuan. After entering the market, a certain silver firm suddenly sold high, and many retail investors closed out positions, causing a drop of 45 yuan. A certain silver firm sold 50 taels to money exchange businesses at 5,100 yuan. Finally, a certain money exchange business saw an opportunity and bought, and securities groups also bought, raising the price by 30 yuan. A certain silver firm bought 50 taels from gold firms at 5,130 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, the price increased sharply by 135 yuan compared to the previous day. It had been rising for five days, totaling 354 yuan, with a fluctuation of 205 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of spot gold from reputable gold firms was several yuan higher, while the buying price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current bid price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, with little activity.</p>
<p>Gold Jewelry Listed at 520 Yuan</p>
<p>The initial selling price of gold jewelry per tael was still listed at 505 yuan by Dahang Tong. At 10:30 AM, it increased by 5 yuan. At 3:00 PM, it increased by another 5 yuan. At 4:15 PM in the evening, it increased by another 5 yuan. As a result, Dahang Tong changed its listing to 520 yuan, a new record high since the market's existence. The listing price of Sinhang Tong was the same, with the buying price reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Food: Manipulation of Foreign Rice Has Reached Exposure; No. 1 Saigon Rice Only Opened at 42.5 Yuan; Manipulating Hoarders Could Not Have Imagined Such a Terrible Fall; A Huge Drop of 10 Yuan in Two Weeks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the source of domestic rice,粳米 (Jing rice) and糯米 (glutinous rice), was from 12 trucks carrying over 600 bags transferred out of Hongkou. It was said that the off-market price outside the rice market was even more sluggish, and transactions were extremely rare. The market price had fallen by about 1 yuan, and the outlets for rice were also scarce. Moreover, with the arrival of new shipments, people were even more uneasy, resulting in a high price for inferior goods, a decrease of 1 yuan, while medium and lower-quality goods were reduced by 1.5 yuan. Since the previous market, the price of various kinds of foreign rice has first tightened and then weakened. Yesterday, market sentiment declined further. Foreign firms were still selling at low prices, leading original grain merchants and speculative hoarders to sell off, causing the market to fall further, which was rare this year. The market-wide transaction seemed to have come to a standstill until the market closed without any change. Statistics on the prices of various goods showed that both Saigon Small Grain were all continuing to fall sharply by 1.5 to 2 yuan compared to the previous market. If No. 1 Saigon rice closed at only 42.5 yuan, Fire Grain at 41 yuan, Small Grain at 38 yuan, No. 2 Siam at 38 yuan, and Mixed Broken Rice at 34 to 33 yuan. Looking back at the sharp fall in rice prices this time, based on the highest price of 52 yuan for No. 1 Saigon rice at that time, it has fallen sharply by 10 yuan in two weeks. Moreover, the current price of 42.5 yuan for No. 1 Saigon rice has fallen below the closing price of 43 yuan last year. The same is true for other goods such as Fire Grain. This was beyond the expectation of the rice industry, especially for the speculative hoarders who specialized in speculation and manipulation, but it was a cause for joy for ordinary people who depended on rice.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wholesale market for foreign rice continued to decline. The market opened in the morning with high prices due to the rise in gold prices, and sellers intended to support prices. However, the supply of goods arriving from various sources was continuous, and general speculators were under pressure from tight monetary policy and had to sell at reduced prices. No. 1 Saigon March futures opened at 52 yuan, then fell to 51.3 yuan. In the afternoon, it was 51 yuan, and there were no buyers. No. 2 opened at 47.5 yuan, and Small Grain opened at 48.35 yuan. The market was weak and lacked transactions. The original package of No. 2 spot goods also started at 46.5 yuan and fell to 46 yuan, and the original package of Small Grain spot goods also fell to 47 yuan, which was nearly 1 to 1.5 yuan lower than the day before. However, market sentiment was weak, and the market situation was not yet stable, and the speculators still had the appearance of eagerly seeking to sell their goods.</p>
<p>Over 30,000 bags of foreign rice continued to arrive. The French ship "Xia Fei" brought over 30,000 bags from Saigon. Jardine Matheson's "Yongsheng" ship brought 1,617 bags from Hong Kong, which were unloaded yesterday. It was reported that the "Yongsheng" ship also had 1,077 bags of foreign rice bound for Yantai and 994 bags of foreign rice bound for Tianjin, which would be shipped to Yantai and Tianjin tomorrow on the same ship. (祖)</p>
<h3>Poor Sales to Customers; The Price of Returned Flour Weakens Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed signs of weakening again. The market for returned goods had been tightening for several days after the lifting of the export ban. However, although exports were not restricted, Northern merchants were still not enthusiastic due to the sharp fall in prices in Tianjin. In addition, rice prices in Shanghai continued to fall, and market sentiment was inevitably weak. It was said that the asking price for "Green Cannon" brand was still 15 yuan, but there were no buyers. "Old Cannon" brand initially opened at 14.5 yuan, and then weakened to 14.43 yuan. The market later opened at 14.4 yuan, but only scattered purchases from inland regional merchants. The market changes may have to wait until the end of the low-price period. It was said that after the expiration of the "Maintenance Flour", the factory's price will inevitably increase.</p>
<p>The wheat market was also quiet yesterday. After Suzhou wheat opened at 25 yuan the day before, buyers successively complained about the high price. However, sellers were determined to hold on because of the shortage of inventory and the failure to arrive of foreign wheat. There were no transactions in the morning. It was said that only one lot of Suzhou wheat was offered in the after-market, with a price of 24.75 yuan, which was slightly lower by 0.25 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Securities: Rumor of British Following US Aid to China; Public Bonds Market Sentiment Exuberant</h3>
<p>Due to the rumor that Britain would follow the US to automatically aid China, the international situation was good, and the market sentiment did not reflect the shrinking of the US dollar exchange rate and the soaring gold price. Market sentiment suddenly turned exuberant, and the auction prices unanimously rebounded. Whether it has the ability to continue depends on how the facts turn out. Judging from the environmental situation, public bonds will not be too soft. Yesterday morning, the market price rose slowly due to a temporary change in market sentiment. Type C once again broke through the 89 mark. Lianhe had some replenishment. Yongkang, Taifeng, Renchang, and No. 64 all had demand, but Hu Heji, Yida, and No. 25 were still being sold off. In the afternoon, Xieda, Shengda, Jiufeng, and Lianyi all had sales, and Yongkang continued to replenish. No. 4, No. 16, and Tiansheng also had purchases. The market price increased by 0.125 yuan, resulting in a rebound of 0.25 to 0.4 yuan compared to yesterday. The total transaction volume was approximately 700,000 yuan. A concise table is recorded below:</p>
<p>Stock trading, 50 shares of Guanshengyuan were traded at a price of 25 yuan. The stock market of the Public Industry Association opened steadily yesterday. Later, due to speculative sell-offs, prices fell slightly, and the transaction volume was not large. Rubber stocks did not break the dull situation due to the tight exchange market.</p>
<p>London, 13th (Wednesday) telegram: The listed market prices of Chinese foreign debts today were still stable, and there were no changes in the upper and lower grades of various bonds.</p>
<p>London, 13th (Wednesday): Today's listed market prices of British-owned Far East companies' stocks have fallen quite a bit. Jardine Matheson Bank shares continued to fall by 1 shilling and 2 pence, with a price of £9 5 shillings. HSBC Bank shares each fell by £1.5, with a price of £91.5. Gulagram Rubber fell by 7.5 pence, to 21 shillings and 3 pence. The new price of Shanghai Waterworks A shares after ex-dividend was £15, which was £1 lower than yesterday. Only Kailuan Coal Mine bearer shares rose by 3 pence, with a price of 19 shillings, and the rest were stable.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Cotton Yarn Mills Changed to Selling for Cash; Although There Were Some Sell-Offs During the Rise, Market Sentiment Was Still Firm and High</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise, with a very strong trend. This was due to the shrinking of the US dollar exchange rate, soaring gold prices, and increased market sentiment, which fueled buying interest. However, due to the high base prices, some had a tendency to sell off. Therefore, during the drastic rise in prices, there were sell-offs. However, the prices offered by the manufacturers were extremely high, and all were changed to cash sales. As a result, large buyers were actively purchasing, and the market trend was still prosperous.</p>
<p>The morning opening for spot yarn saw market sentiment slightly loosen due to the fall in overseas cotton markets, and profit-taking long positions emerged, resulting in a slightly weak market. The price of 20-count Double Horse in March was 970 yuan, and it immediately fell to 963 yuan. Shortly after, it was heard that the exchange rate had been reduced again, market sentiment gradually increased, and there were large buyers who were buying, so the market price gradually rose to 981 yuan. According to statistics, the transaction volume in half a day was 2,043 packages. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 16 yuan. On the 15th, 45 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong and 155 pieces were shipped to Xiamen. The amount purchased by various regional merchants is listed as follows: Fellow merchants: 1,863 Hong Kong: 160 Fuzhou: 10 Inland: 10 Total: 2,043</p>
<h3>Sluggish Cotton Market; Although US Cotton is Small, Factory Demand is Not Healthy</h3>
<p>Transactions in domestic cotton have been relatively sluggish. This is due to the mediocre price of Indian cotton and the lack of shrinkage in the British exchange rate, resulting in slightly weaker sentiment. However, the purchasing prices remain high. The US dollar exchange rate has shrunk drastically, making 42-count raw materials very expensive. The factory's demand for Xin Naxi is healthier, but there is no amount of quota available for collection. Therefore, the market is stable. From Subei sources, 1,106 packages of Datong Flower have arrived. The current cotton situation is as follows: Pingguo Er: 186.00 Fellow merchants bought: 900 pieces North Taicang: Straw bag: 207.50 Also: 260 packages Also: 204.00 Also: 200 packages Wujiang Flower: 239.00 Shen Xin purchased: 1,000 dan Tongda Packaging: 213.00 Fellow merchants bought: 200 pieces</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Prices: In the New York cotton market, the morning initially saw prices decline due to reports of falls from Liverpool. Later, prices fell again due to mass sell-offs and the liquidation of some long positions, especially for deferred deliveries. As a result, closing prices fell by over ten pounds for near-term deliveries and twenty-two pounds for deferred deliveries. Indian shipments are forecast to fall by another eight rupees. Egyptian prices saw both rises and falls.</p>
<p>Another report: Due to the tightening of the British and American exchange rates in the Shanghai port foreign cotton trade recently, the US dollar exchange rate has shrunk to 6.375 yuan. Although the US cotton fell by over 20 pounds yesterday, the converted cotton price did not fluctuate much. However, market sentiment is not as firm as it was a few days ago, so the transaction is quite quiet. The factory does not want to offer new yarns, so it has not taken any action. The price of US cotton sent to the factory converted at a US dollar exchange rate of 6.375 yuan is as follows: 20-count US Middling: 279.50 Also, Lower Grade: 269.60 32-count: Also: 293.00 Also, Lower Grade: 282.00 42-count: Also: 295.00 Also, Lower Grade: 285.60</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Domestic Merchants Actively Buying; Cotton Cloth Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>The cloth market continues to rise due to the brisk sales in the local and Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong regions. The industry reports a contraction, and both inside and outside the industry have the idea of ​​doing more. The selling price of coarse and fine cloth has risen by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan, fine twill has risen by 0.125 yuan, and bleached, dyed, and printed cloth from factories such as Luncang and Yihe has increased by 0.5 to 1.5 yuan. The turnover in the local market reached more than 1,000 pieces. Merchants from Wen Ning in eastern Zhejiang bought more than 500 pieces of coarse cloth, bleached cloth, and colored cloth. Merchants from Fujian and Guangdong also bought more than 100 pieces each.</p>
<p>The trade in East Cloth in the local market is brisk. White fine cloth and fine twill each continued to rise by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan per piece, and colored serge rose by 1 cent per yard. However, the factory warehouse receipts of Longtou fine cloth, where the goods from last year that have not been sold in March, must be charged a warehouse rent of 10 yuan per piece in April. Therefore, there is a distinction between new and old warehouse receipts, and the selling price differs by 0.15 to 0.2 yuan per piece. So yesterday, when the price was firm, the old warehouse receipts of Longtou were 28.2 yuan, while the new warehouse receipts had to be 28.35 yuan. The current issue of Four Gentlemen serge has increased to 8.475 cents, and the next month is even more expensive, with sales opening at 8.6 cents. On the 14th, 47 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong and 280 pieces were shipped to Haiphong. On the 15th, 9 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Dutch Red Opened at 3,000 Bags</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to exhibit upward momentum. The Association's designated price for spot goods was 24 yuan for coarse white, up 0.5 yuan, at 63.5 yuan for both local and foreign new goods, and 63.2 to 63 yuan for old goods. Transshipment goods remained at 49 yuan. Dutch red was up 0.5 yuan, MP Mark at 48 yuan, WA Mark at 47.5 to 47.2 yuan.

Several dozen bags of Hainan foreign were at 51 yuan. Jianbang opened for sale 200 bags of Diaoh Qing, still at 49 yuan.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Prices Too High; Raw Soybean Oil Difficult to Sell</h3>
<p>The market for soybean oil and peanut oil has not seen much development recently. The fluctuation range is only within one yuan. In short, prices are expensive, and there is a sense that the moving funds have become too large. Therefore, both buying and selling are sluggish, and the rise and fall are also slight. However, the recent trade has shown some activity, and the market price has risen by two yuan in the past two days. However, sales are only within the tastes of local shops. Yesterday, the total market traded 230 barrels of Dalian soybean oil at a price of 116.5 to 117 yuan, 20 barrels of Changzhou soybean oil at a price of 115 yuan, 20 barrels of Hankou soybean oil at a price of 112 yuan, 50 barrels of Bengbu soybean oil at a price of 112 yuan, 10 barrels of Jiangbei soybean oil at a price of 115 yuan, 100 dan of Dayou factory soybean oil at a price of 91 yuan, 300 pieces of Yantai soybean oil at a price of 82 yuan, 20 barrels of Qingdao peanut oil at a price of 114 yuan, 30 barrels of Jiangbei raw oil at a price of 112 to 112.5 yuan, and 600 cans of Yantai raw oil at a price of 104.5 yuan.</p>

<h3>Opening the Dams</h3>
<p>The five dams downstream of the Grand Canal are: Cheluo, Nanguan, Xinba, Zhongba, and Zhaoguan. Only Zhaoguan is located in the territory of Ganquan, and the remaining four dams belong to Gaoyou. In the fifth year of Tongzhi, there was a flood. The opening of the dam was delayed, resulting in the breach of the Qingshui Tan embankment. Subsequently, Cao Shuai Wu奏 (memorialized) the determination of restrictions. The opening and closing were timely, so over the years, major disasters have not been brewed. It is planned that every year before autumn, the limit is set. When the water level is one zhang and four chi, Cheluo is opened. Over four cun, Nanguan is opened. Over four cun, Xinba is opened. Another four cun, Zhongba is opened. After autumn, the Cheluo system is set, with a water level of one zhang and two chi and eight cun as the rate, and the Nanguan dams are still limited to four cun. In the sixth month of last year before the full moon, there were heavy rains for ten days. In addition, the upstream water势 (power) of Honghu was high, and the limit had been exceeded by more than one chi before autumn. The superior authorities all said that they should be conservative. Yang Daoxian, Pang Sheng San observed, personally came to the project to see if opening the dam was for the sake of the people's lives, or if protecting the dam was for the sake of the people's livelihood. They all thought that it was for the sake of the people and should not be biased. The water level was protected until after autumn, when the water level reached one zhang and six chi. Therefore, Cheluo was opened on the 16th, Nanguan was opened on the 20th, and Xinba was opened on the 24th. The water situation gradually receded.</p>
<h3>Giant Monkey Becomes a Worship</h3>
<p>There is a village in India called Agubala. Recently, 200 large monkeys suddenly came. Experts say that this is a species of Baipomu. This type of monkey is about three to four chi tall, strong, and bold. They are not afraid of people at all and enter the homes of the villagers to grab fruit and food and play with miscellaneous things. Women and children are all abused by them. People hate them but dare not attack them. Because this type of monkey will retaliate in groups if one of them is attacked, even the police dare not do anything about it. It is now heard that they have奏 (memorialized) to the 朝 (court), asking to send troops to suppress them.</p>

<h3>Business Ethics and Reputation</h3>
<p>— Chu</p>
<p>Since the discovery of lining the rice bucket with manure paper and lining the oil scoop with 洋鉛皮(white lead skins), almost every day new methods of deception are discovered, such as insufficient weight on scales. In today's life where prices are so high, this kind of layered exploitation, we feel that simply imposing fines does not seem to be enough to serve as a warning to others.</p>
<p>However, these methods of deception certainly did not start today. We have never seen people who buy oil actually weigh it, and no one cares about the weight of rice and grains. Other biscuits and candies naturally do not pay attention to the difference in weight. So, deducting one or a few from ten or one hundred seems to be normal behavior, not worth mentioning. For example, recently two well-known biscuit and candy companies were also found to have insufficient weight on their scales and were fined. A certain plantation company even used unsterilized milk on the market. They are all long-established companies in Shanghai. How could they be willing to destroy the company's business reputation for a small amount of profit? If you allow me to say something arbitrary, their scales have weighed countless tons of biscuits and candies, and unsterilized milk may have caused people to have gastrointestinal diseases, but it was only discovered today.</p>
<p>The first and most important thing in doing business is to adhere to business ethics, and at the same time, pay attention to your own shortcomings everywhere. Don't think that because customers are careless, you can deal with them casually; you must know that the carelessness of customers is a sign of trust in you, which is the most valuable harvest in business, but once a problem is discovered, the profits you have harvested cannot make up for the losses you will suffer.</p>
<p>As for those who deliberately use deceptive means to deceive customers, there is naturally no question of morality. I have already said that fines are too light a punishment for them. However, in the final analysis, the most important thing in doing business is reputation. After a reputation goes bankrupt, it will inevitably encounter the greatest punishment.</p>
<h3>Discussing Graduation Yearbooks</h3>
<p>— (Quan)</p>
<p>Recently, various schools are preparing to publish graduation yearbooks and annual yearbooks. Regarding various issues, a certain newspaper has launched a heated discussion. At a time when citizens of all levels in the isolated islands are seriously threatened by prices, I would also like to express my humble opinion to discuss it.</p>
<p>The issuance of a yearbook or annual report naturally has commemorative significance; this significance certainly cannot be erased. The issuance of this kind of commemorative book may become a precious page in a person's life history. When I graduated from high school, although I did not express opposition to the issuance of the yearbook, I did not pay attention to it. Many years later, when I occasionally flip through it, recalling my life as a student, I can't help but feel vicissitudes. At that time, a book that was not worth paying attention to has now become my treasure. However, things have changed, and now a graduation yearbook requires 4 to 5 yuan, which is not only too wasteful, but also in the current economic difficulties, this 4 to 5 yuan cannot be borne by ordinary parents.</p>
<p>I believe that the commemorative nature of a yearbook does not lie in the splendor of the decoration, the exquisite paper, or the publication of a few copied academic articles. I think that the yearbook must truly achieve commemorative value, such as emotional words between teachers and students, and real records of each student's life at school. Other prefaces, empty farewell feelings, and artistic works of flowers and birds do not need to waste space, and only white paper printing is required. This saves money and has a real commemorative meaning. Or a small number of students in a grade cannot afford this expense, then of course they cannot be forced; you can take a group photo together, and use the group photo to make a zinc plate for printing. (Because if you ask a photo studio to print more, the price is extremely high.) Then everyone signs on the back of the group photo. I think a photo like this is enough to be worth a thick, splendid yearbook. Then print a directory (which can be printed on a mimeograph), which is truly a simple and inexpensive yearbook. Writing this, I thought of someone last year who advocated donating yearbook fees to save lives. I think a splendid yearbook can be omitted, but at least a simple and inexpensive souvenir must be printed, and then use the remaining money to save lives, wouldn't that be good?</p>
<h3>New Shanghai Commodity Price Lament (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Tu Shouzuo</p>
<p>Today, the price of tofu equals that of meat, with ten squares selling for one silver dollar. Compared to the past, it's shocking, a fivefold increase since before the rice war.</p>
<p>For New Year banquets, guests are invited, and sumptuous dishes display wealth. A single course can cost fifty or sixty yuan, yet people say the styles are unadorned.</p>
<p>Guests are offered cigarettes in white tin packages, but even that is considered thrifty and ridiculed. A canned pack sells for about two yuan, casting good money into the fire.</p>
<p>A cleaver costs four yuan and change, and the price of Fuyang straw paper keeps rising. Most other types of paper are incredibly expensive, with red paper selling for two hao per sheet.</p>
<p>The selling price is different from before, what can one do? Socks are worn out, and it's time to buy new ones. Real stockings cost one yuan and eight jiao, and cotton socks are more than six jiao per pair.</p>
<p>Red and green tea, used to quench thirst, have seen their prices increase again and again. Each pound costs at least one yuan and six jiao, with old leaves lacking the fragrance of young buds.</p>
<p>Fried dough sticks resemble hinge supports, and sesame cakes look like crab shells. One piece costs two fen in legal tender, causing hunger among the working class.</p>
<p>Everyone is raising prices with a ruthless heart, subtly increasing costs while reducing quantity. One Yuan head silver coin buys three pounds of goods; New Year cakes, both yellow and white, are traded by the English weight.</p>
<p>Noodle shop owners are also cunning, demanding a temporary halt to the production of plain flour. The new price is four jiao and six fen for two jin, as the machinery grinds back into operation.</p>
<p>The price of fresh fruit on trees is increasing, and even when available, it's hard to buy. Fortune oranges can only be replaced by mandarin oranges, with one yuan buying only two jin.</p>
<p>Comparing the present with the past is impossible; as the water rises, so does the soap head. In the past, one sheep weighed nine pounds, but now four pounds is all one can get.</p>
<p>Gold is the central hub of the market, where foreign exchange speculation determines gains and losses. The five-hundred-yuan mark is on the verge of being broken, causing the most alarming impact on commodity prices.</p>
<p>Fish and shrimp enhance the pleasure of wine, but at this moment, fish and shrimp are unbearably expensive. One liang of green fish costs one jiao, and each live shrimp costs three fen and three li.</p>
<p>Sales are unique, and prices are considered low; no one is hoarding salt. One yuan buys one hundred and ten liang on the vegetable scale, and the deal can still be negotiated with a slight addition.</p>
<p>Oppression has become stricter, making it hard to clothe oneself and impossible to remain silent. After surviving the chaos, one worries about clothing and food, with daily life more difficult than scaling steep cliffs. (To subsidize the stabilization of rice prices)</p>
<h3>To Those Who Sympathize with Impoverished Students - Reply to Gentlemen Zhi and Tao -</h3>
<p>— Qiang Gong</p>
<p>Since my humble work "An Absent Student" was published on the sixth of this month, I hoped to lighten the burden on my heart, as it was merely the duty of the writer to report. Now, the editorial department has forwarded letters from Gentlemen Zhi and Tao, both expressing sympathy for an absent, impoverished student and willing to provide assistance, inquiring, "If there is such a case, please provide the address of the impoverished student. Or is it a small piece of social writing depicting the current state of affairs?" My respectful reply is as follows:</p>
<p>An absent student exists, and the situation is real; even if Mr. Tao believes it is "a small piece of social writing depicting the current state of affairs," it must have a subject to depict, not something conjured out of thin air.</p>
<p>Because Gentlemen Zhi and Tao have shown compassion for the impoverished student and wish to provide assistance, I express my deepest gratitude and have sent a school servant to investigate the address and bring the original letters from Zhi and Tao to the student as "rice coupons." However, the student has already returned home, and their earnest intentions cannot be conveyed. The misfortunes of the poor know no bounds! The student did not register for the current term, and the previously described situation occurred last winter during a snowy scene.</p>
<p>However, in today's isolated island, there must be many such impoverished students. In the future, I will report any encounters to Gentlemen Zhi and Tao so that their desire to benefit impoverished students can be fulfilled as soon as possible. I will also collect information on the oppressed groups in society and the inhuman situations they face, writing about them to find a path of mercy for the disaster victims. I hope that beyond Gentlemen Zhi and Tao, more people will rise up.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Episode 21: Combining Economic Principles with Delicate Maintenance; Enhancing Machinery to Aid Literary Achievement</p>
<p>Miss Zhu Airen and Miss Zhen He had never visited a newspaper office abroad and found it very interesting. Shao Huihua said:</p>
<p>'The evening paper here is not very extensive, it is only in Shanghai city and a few places near Shanghai that it can be delivered on the same night. Because at six o'clock, there are still trains and buses leaving Shanghai for various docks, so the last evening paper is rushed out to catch this time. That's only running a very small part of the machinery, if it's the morning paper, then all the machinery is started, that's a sight to see.' Wu Junsuo said: 'Oh! Are all these twenty-odd machines running?' Shao Huihua said: 'Although not all of them are running, at least eighteen or nineteen are running. The remaining few are either having some problems, but they are prepared as backups. Or because they are too tired, too exhausted, like a person, they also need to rest. The newspaper has to be published every day at the same time, there can't be any delays, so it's better to have a few more machines.' Wu Junsuo said: 'After the newspaper comes out of the machine, what's the second step?' Shao Huihua said: 'Don't you see a large skylight above each machine? This skylight is the next floor. The printed paper is automatically transferred from the machine to the skylight on the upper floor and delivered upstairs. Upstairs, near the skylight, are the packing rooms, where the machine automatically delivers the paper, and then someone packs it. From the packing room to the truck transporting the paper, there is also a small track that is temporarily set up. When the truck is full, it speeds away, to the train station, to the ship dock, to the airport. Generally, from the time the roll of blank paper is sent to the machine, until it is printed, packed, loaded, and transported onto boats and airplanes, it takes no more than ten minutes. The distribution time can be considered extremely efficient, and this is because everything is in order, so it can be done step by step. And this is a daily occurrence, and once you get used to it, it becomes second nature.' Wu Junsu said: 'Amazing! Do these machines have to be divided by province? You said there are twenty-four machines, are they divided into twenty-four provinces? Or is each machine given a place name, as the name of the machine, like the street names in Shanghai, with Shandong Road, Shanxi Road, Hubei Road, Henan Road names. Otherwise, why is there a sign on each machine, with the names of various places written on it?' Shao Huihua looked at it and smiled, 'This makes a lot of sense.' She pointed to a machine near her and said: 'For example, the machine above has a sign with the name of Zhejiang Province, needless to say, the newspapers printed on this machine are all transported to Zhejiang Province. If it is marked with another province, it is transported to another province.' (250)</p>
<h3>Citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven (4)</h3>
<p>We cannot assume someone is a citizen of the Kingdom of Heaven just because they are respectable. A respectable person may never uphold justice, support morality, or have generosity, courage, and selflessness. Nicodemus was a respectable man, and Pilate was also a respectable man, but they lacked the courage to uphold justice at risk. Many respectable people can only passively avoid doing evil, but cannot actively promote justice. Morally, they are correct, but spiritually, they are dead. They believe in God, but are unwilling to take risks for God; they believe God maintains justice, but at crucial moments, they rely on human power instead of God. They are afraid to sacrifice or engage in moral or spiritual risk-taking. Therefore, to be citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven, besides being genuinely respectable, we must also have noble faith, and be willing to fight our own wild nature every day, so that it is under our control. For the sake of maintaining justice, honor, and chastity, we must be willing to give up everything else. The Kingdom of Heaven represents a life of truth and justice. Individual lives and social work must be guided by the qualifications set by Jesus—tolerance, charity, selflessness, and goodwill. Every Sunday, we recite the Lord's Prayer, "Thy kingdom come." Do we truly want God's kingdom to come? Know that God's kingdom cannot fall from the sky, it can only come through our efforts. We must ask ourselves if we have the courage, strength, and will to be citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven? For detailed study, please write to P.O. Box 1227.</p>

<h3>Random Talks on Opera by Hu Qi</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>Review of Xi Xiaobo's "The Bird Basin"</p>
<p>Yesterday I listened to Xi Xiaobo perform "The Bird Basin". Xi played Liu Shichang, singing the Xipi Yuanban, the "Sighing at Life" section, the tempo was slightly fast. When singing "The sky changes" to the scattered part, he placed the "changes" character as a narrow, short note at the end of the previous word. Xiaobo's voice is well-developed in the high range, so he is good at producing this sound. The "Traveling" scene is best at this part. The next scene, singing "What a good Zhao Da…" section, he disliked the "exists" being too low, and the "midway" "mid" character being too high, which does not complement the "way" character's low tone. Tonal highs and lows must complement each other, otherwise it's called a "hard mountain range." Although the "mid" character is Yin Ping tone, it does not need to be a high note (gongche notation six), because the "way" character, Yang Ping tone, uses a low tone (gongche notation at the four character), going from six to four is not harmonious. This matter seems small, but its importance is actually great. This is a distinction between the fine and coarse points of musical meter, and it must be paid attention to. Singing the two lines "Yes, yes, I understand", he completely imitated Ma Lianliang's singing style. For those who don't know opera, they may think this sounds good in Lianliang's records. If you listen to the "understand" and "come" characters, Yang Ping tones, they all use Beijing pronunciation, which has a tendency to be reversed. Singing the "Old sir, no need" section is generally very good, the "ba" and "ao" characters are all acceptable, but slightly lacking in fullness. The large section of Fan Erhuang, "Never opened his mouth", the beginning tempo is too fast, "The Lord of Heaven sent down rain," using the old tune's high pitch, is very good. I haven't heard this tune in many years. After "Three years", he adds a large piece of embellishment, but this embellishment is very poor and can be removed. The "cover the face" "face" character embellishment is very sufficient. The "pity me" "pity" character is dragged out for several sections, then the "me" character suddenly becomes very slow. This is a new method invented by Yan Jupeng, and is also not a good example. The "pity" character is sung on the beat, which also does not match the beat position. All the way singing fast "tempo", suddenly "shifting slow" particularly is not allowed by singing rules. This three-character embellishment, the best was Wang Yutian, a Tan school amateur. In short, Xi Xiaobo's beautiful high tone has not reached the age of maturity, so this play lacks sad emotion. In a few more years, with diligent practice, it will not be difficult to reach the pinnacle. At present, it is not appropriate to sing tragedies. If he sings according to Liu Hongsheng's style, "The Execution of His Son", "The Execution of the Yellow Robe", Xiaobo's voice will surely become popular. Using troops requires using one's strengths. I wonder if Xiaobo will listen to my words? (The End)</p>
<h3>Superstitions of Movie Stars</h3>
<p>— Lu</p>
<p>Superstition is very common in Hollywood. Almost every star is superstitious, and very peculiar and strange. For example:</p>
<p>Bette Davis likes to shoot the first scene on a rainy day, or shoot a rain scene first; because she won her first Oscar on a rainy day.</p>
<p>Robert Taylor never puts his hat on his bed.</p>
<p>Errol Flynn does not sail or fly on the thirteenth.</p>
<p>Joan Crawford believes old socks can bring her luck.</p>
<p>David Niven is most afraid of broken mirrors.</p>
<p>Werner Moore's makeup box always has a picture of a Jewish pray-er taped inside.</p>
<p>Henry Fonda considers encountering a dwarf an unfavorable omen.</p>
<p>Ann Sheridan always wears a gold chain when filming her first scene, said to be the one she wore when she first appeared on screen.</p>
<p>Hedy Lamarr always stays in bed on the thirteenth and also on Friday.</p>
<p>Patricia Lam is in the past he almost drowned.</p>
<p>Sonja Henie always shoots with old shoelaces.</p>
<h3>Tian Han, Ouyang Yuqian, Wang Bosheng — Recent New Developments</h3>
<p>— Haixing</p>
<p>Tian Han recently went from Changsha to Liuzhou, Guangxi. According to him, he is very interested in improving local opera, and has written more than a dozen such scripts in recent years.</p>
<p>In addition to serving as the director of the Guangxi Drama and Music Hall, Ouyang Yuqian was recently hired as the host of the Nanhua Theater, which was established with funding from the provincial government. Construction has already begun, and Ouyang has appointed Li Hua as the manager of the theater. After the theater is established, in addition to staging spoken dramas, it will also stage improved Beijing opera and spoken dramas, it is said.</p>
<p>Chongqing recently established the "Chinese Academy of Arts". The authorities hired Wang Bosheng as the dean, and Wan Laitian is in charge of the drama department.</p>
<p>Old Shu's Jest</p>
<h3>About Sona</h3>
<p>— Sheweng</p>
<p>All musical instruments used on stage are indeed tools that control the plot. Whether it is singing or dancing, speaking or acting, being lively or still, everything is helped by the music to express and transform as much as possible. Not only do the performers rely on it for their livelihood, but the audience also does not feel lonely because the music propels the story. Among the instruments, the sona can be said to be the most ancient. Its exciting meaning is actually more powerful than the sheng, xiao, pipe, and flute. In Beijing opera, the sona is sometimes used to play tunes, which insiders call "large characters." Now, however, there is playing but no singing. Most of it has changed from the so-called large characters to being wordless. When I watched the play "Cui Ping Mountain", as Yang Xiong was returning home and his wife was facing him, Yang Xiong suddenly reached out and slapped Qiaoyun's face. At this time, the stage played a short sona sound. If you say that it is also helping the action, it is unavoidable that it is inexplicable, and it does not seem to fully display Yang Xiong's angry emotions. Also, after the slap on Qiaoyun's face, Yang Xiong gave her another slap on the other side. The sona still rang out with the same tone, and it seemed to continue the first half of the tune. But I don't know whether the sona that followed Yang Xiong's hand hitting Qiaoyun's face had singing or not. Who should sing it? What is the meaning of the lyrics? It's all hard to solve. Unless he has a basis for it, that it originated from Kunqu opera or Qinqiang opera, before getting the correct answer, I will always consider it mysterious. For the shallow viewers, they would even think that Pan Qiaoyun's face has vocal cords, a joke.</p>
<p>Reader's Opinion</p>
<h3>Contributing to Film Publications</h3>
<p>— Qian Zhenni</p>
<p>Dear Editor: I am a total movie fan. I watch one or two hundred Chinese and foreign movies every year. I also have several hobbies: one is collecting brochures and ticket stubs, and now I even have those from Odeon and Epulo. Another is collecting star photos. Regarding this, I think it's best to have autographed photos, but I regret to say that I have received very few from stars, which shows how difficult it is. A third is widely purchasing film and television publications. From small newspapers to the early film supplements of Shen Bao, I treasure them all. I read in the Entertainment Circle that a comprehensive "China Film News" pictorial weekly will be published before March 22. This is not only good news for me, but probably for all readers. I have the lowest expectations for any film and television publication: First, it must uphold a pure purpose like the "Entertainment Circle". In terms of content, avoid malicious records such as attacks, because this is indirect deception of readers. I hope that each special issue will have interesting and valuable news, and I also hope to have introductions to film songs and trivia. Second, the form must be beautiful. The photos, paper, and printing must all be well-crafted so that readers will permanently save them. Third, it should be able to solicit autographed photos from stars on behalf of readers and give them away, which is what movie fans would most like.</p>
<p>In the midst of the scarcity of Chinese film publications, I hope that you will support the birth of new publications, which will invisibly promote the development of the Chinese film industry. What do you think? Qian Zhenni</p>
<p>(Editor's note) Mr. Zhenni's hopes are indeed very reasonable. I have always hated boring film and drama publications that needlessly attack individuals. This is really an immoral and impure attitude, so this publication has always taken "hiding evil and promoting good" as its duty. Regarding the "China Film News" being launched on the 22nd, it is said to be a very substantial and perfect publication.</p>

<h3>"Maiden's Lament" on Stage</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>The Zhengyan Art Troupe is newly established. Although it is a new organization, the members are all veterans in the drama circle and drama workers who are familiar to everyone. They hope to have further achievements in dramatic art and make more powerful contributions in performances, so they organized Zhengyan. "Maiden's Lament" is their first time meeting the audience under the name of Zhengyan, and it is also the first shot they have started towards their ideal. (Premiering this Saturday at the Russian Art Theater) Therefore, they have used the greatest effort to prepare the lineup is very substantial, with actors Wu Mei, Zhang Jie, Chen Zhong, Yili, Wen Piao, Liyang, and Zheng Tong, etc. Such a lineup is rare in amateur performances. Especially Wu Mei, she has been away from the stage for almost a year, recently she became the boss of the Longzhen Restaurant, and this time she is playing Norma Shearer's Elizabeth in her busy business, the director is Wu Zhi, who is rich in research spirit and creativity. They have been rehearsing for more than two months. With the careful cooperation of such excellent actors and directors, a surprising result is expected. Friends who love drama, of course, don't need to be said, friends who have seen the movie "Maiden's Lament"! You should also go and see what kind of conflict story it is.</p>
