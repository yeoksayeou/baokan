<p>柏林　此間頃宣稱、德義日三國公的已於今日下午一時在柏林簽字、（二十七日海通電）</p>
<p>柏林　日本今日已加入德義軸心、而與德義簽訂一軍事及經濟同盟、此三全能國之歷史性同盟、係於下午一時十二分在德德首府中、於希特勒前簽字、此爲德國所設計企圖阻礙美國動作及分裂英帝國之同盟、於遠東之將來將有極大影響、協定簽字之情形、頗似去年德義軍事同盟簽字或舉行時之狀況、代表義國簽字之齊亞諾、係於下午十二時三十分飛抵柏林、較預期遲到二小時半、隨齊亞諾同來者並有義外部之條的專家多人、白朗登堡門前、於德義國旗之外、復懸掛日旗一面、又有小型日旗、當局在街中分給德國學童、（二十七日合衆電）</p>
<p>柏林　德義日三國公的全文如下、德義日三國以爲永久和平之先決條件、爲世界各國、均獲得適當之地位、已決定對於三國在「大東亞」及歐洲區城之努力互相合作、三國之主要目標爲建設新秩序、增淮關係各國之繁榮與福利、三國政府希望與其他範圍之國家合作、藉以實現和平世界之終極願望、因此德義日三國政府、商定下列各項條文、</p>
<p>第一條　日本承認及尊重德義兩國在歐洲建設歐洲新秩序之領導地位、</p>
<p>第二條　德義兩國承認及尊重日本在亞洲建設「大東亞新秩序」之領導地位、</p>

<p>柏林　一般人皆認該約係代替三國以前之防共公約、但有可注意者、卽防共公約係專以蘇聯爲對象、而且下之公約、則對於蘇聯之新關係、曾加特殊承認、此間外交界人士感以爲該約之第事、則德義將予日本以援助、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>三簽約國宣言</p>
<p>柏林　德外長里賓特洛甫親自遞接義外長齊亞諾及日本大使來栖、參加德義日三國公的之簽字儀式、德外長發表演說略稱、德義日三國政府已決定簽訂重耍公的、渠於密的全文、以德義日三國語言官讀後、代表德國政府宣稱、德國於一九三三年以後、希望以和平方式修改現狀、德國人民亦有治理其自然領土之權利、國社黨早已決定爲德國人民獲得生存之權利、渠根機希特勒元首之命令而簽訂之三國公的、爲三國聯台一致、實現共同利益之莊嚴宣言、此項公的之目的、爲德義兩國領導建設歐洲新秩序、日本領導建設「大東亞新秩序」、此項公的之基礎、不僅爲三國之友誼、且爲三國之共同利益、此項公的並不以任何國家爲對象、而係針對煽動戰事及企圖延長或擴大戰事者之步驟、此項公的爲三大强國之軍事同盟條的、將有助於歐洲及「大東亞」新秩序之建設、並使世界和平儘述實現、任何國家希望參加此項集團者、必與以誠摯之歡迎、但企圖干涉歐洲或東亞」題之解決、或襲擊德義日三國之一者、將遭遇三國二五〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇人之聯合力量云、齊亞諾亦發表演說、申述新公約爲防止戰事擴大之壁壘、但該公的之重要性、超越目前之局勢、而爲三國之永久團結云、日本大使宣稱、該公約之終極目標、爲建設世界和平、以正義爲基礎之普遍而永爾之和平、希望與具有同樣目標及進行同樣計劃之國家共同合作、該公的對於德義日</p>
<p>柏林　義外長齊亞諾宣讀關於德義日三國公約之文吿、略稱、此項公的已證明德義旦二國之政治經濟與軍事之合作、及共同之利益與目標、三國均須覓致生存之空間、但爲獨估世界資源之國家所拒絕、三國之團結並非臨時之外交策略、而爲歷史之表現、此項團結可於歷史上覓獲共原因與目標、此項公約簡單而明顯、德義兩國與日本互相承認建設新秩序之領導地位、德義日三國並無戚脅他國之意向、而以阻止戰事擴大爲目標、此項公約不僅表示目前之團結、對於將來亦具有決定之價値云、（二十七日海通電）</p>
<p>英美方面反應</p>
<p>倫敦　英國頃對德義日三國同盟作第一次之反應、謂該項條約貫爲一空泛條約、消息靈通者稱、自英人觀之、此項條約究能影饗此時之局勢吾、殊難預必、並稱德義、恐難由聯合日本之手段、對英採取堅强行動、彼等並引述美國貸華二千五百萬美元及羅總統禁運鋼與軸心國及日本兩事、謂人們應估量將來民主國家之得失、又此間官方並稱、此種同盟協定英國對之絕不恐懼、（二十七日合衆電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　美國非官方面頃對德義日協定、立卽予以反應、謂此協定就此間度之、實不過一至多延長五年之事實、國務部對此不願卽時發表評諭、然權威方面稱、此項協定、目的在對付美國、已屬毫無疑義、（二十七日合衆電）</p>

<h3 id="c2">延不解決之交通工潮 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>自公共租界電車公共汽車工人先後罷工；法租界之電車公共汽車工人繼之而取同樣之行動，雖法租界偶有少數有軌電車勉强開駛，以利行人，但可云上海整個租界以內公用交通事業完全因罷工而在停頓之中，此其所予數百萬市民以行動上深刻嚴重之影響，固無待言；故無不迫切希望工潮之得早日解決，而無如雙方之若即若離，似一時尙無復工之望。夫工潮之出於某一種工商業，影響所及，亦僅限於某一業之有關係者。例如一家藥店職員之罷工，仍不虞無購藥之處，則其影響所及於一般者自微。若公用事業既爲公用，勞資雙方除應各爲自己利益攸關而有所折衝外，尙應顧及公衆之利害，豈可爲城門失火而殃及池魚哉！故工潮如遷延一日，一般對於公用事業勞資雙方之不快將日甚一日。而租界當局平時對於電車公共汽車之增加車資；體恤備至，輒爲核准、而今對於市民因交通工人罷工所遭之不便，亦宜如何採取有效之處置，謀公允之解決，俾得早日復工，以利行旅。此固爲一般人所渴望也。</p>
<p>罷工之原因，想必簡單而有其必要，一言以蔽之；當必爲經濟之原因也；良以目前物價之有增無減，日用之入不敷出，除絕少數之富裕有閒階級外，固無不同感生活之困苦艱難。故交通工人爲求維持其必需之生存，而望改善其原有之待遇，以應付目前之生活，其動機果純潔，其發爲要求，自非得已；及因所求不遂，而有不得不出於工人最後之武器－罷工，衡情略迹，亦不能不寄以相當之同情。顧交通工人既負有維持公共交通，便利公衆行動之職責，亦應一念及於罷工之後，大衆所感覺之不便爲如何；若能早日回復原有之交通工具，以便利公衆之行動，此則公衆之感想又如何！而在勞方或以爲責不在工人，應在資方：資方如能容納勞方之要求，朝聞命而夕復工可也。其言誠然，但吾人以爲條件之磋商。自有其必需之過程；如何成立雙方所可同意之協定，亦非咄嗟所能辦；但萬事必有其原則、原則旣立，則枝節問題，亦不難迎刃而解。故以爲一朝原則如可爲雙方所同意，則應立時恢復工作，至細目之協定，可讓諸雙方代表之商訂。</p>
<p>現下洋商營業往往有一種通行之錯覺，孜孜於其利益標準之保持，故外匯短縮，恒不顧大衆負擔，增加附費，提商價目，對於生產之職工，有無休戚與共之誠意，恐不暇顧及也。夫衣食足而後知禮義，人至生活無可維持之際即無肆其簧鼓，尙欲攘臂而起，何况工潮旣以潮稱、掀風作浪自易易耳！資方平昔怠於注意工人生活之情况，及工潮旣作，又無法求解決，而惟對顧客表示十分遺憾，庸有濟乎？甚至拒不延見工方代表，則去解決之途愈遠矣。</p>
<p>竊以爲勞資糾紛，在所難免，惟有勞資各自念其立塲雖有東西，利害終歸一致，故勞方對於資方，除爲其生存所必需，待遇所應有，而有所要求改善以外，其他非所當問；資方對合理之要求，應物品善意之處理，能採納者則應儘量採納，不能採納者自當明示以理由；俾勞方知其所要求者爲過分。蓋處今日之局面下，表面繁榮，內實空虛堅强人物」、而能以若希特勒之鐵石心腸、對付任伺外國之弱點、然霍氏又謂松岡又爲實在主義者、其對英美聯合陣綫力量、決不至估價甚低、霍氏又謂、松岡之行動無諭固執或錯誤、一以自信爲基礎、因是其行動之結果、非爲有希望卽屬危隃云、（二十七日合衆電）</p>

<p>— 原著者John　Gunther載美國外交季刋</p>
<p>日軍在法屬越南登陸之後，德義日三國卽繼之訂立軍事同盟，太平洋形勢此後不免日見緊張。本報茲譯載美國的太平洋政策一文，俾讀者得以窺見木問題中美國的處境。至於「歐戰叢談」續稿，容後仍當絡續發表。</p>
<p>太牛洋在世界五大洋中範圍最大。自東至西最廣處幾達一萬哩，南北最廣處的七千哩。面積的佔六千八百萬方哩的佔地球全部海面之半。其間有三處英國屬地卽加拿六，澳洲，紐西蘭；有美國等十二個共和國；有構成日本四千零七十二個火山島嶼；還有中國，菲律濱羣島，荷屬東印度羣島？沿北太平洋邊緣，蘇聯與美國相隔不及六十哩。它是財貨和商業的一個龐大倉庫，是各種貿易必經的要逍，是在國策方面扮演諸般冒險的劇　，也是未　糾紛的焦點。</p>
<p>美國對於遠東和太平洋問題的態度，是給三種鮮明政策所支配的。三種政策就是：（一）一八九九年海的翰所宣佈的開放門戶政策。這個政策最簡單的界說就是，凡願與中國貿易的各國人民，一律享受機會均等。（二）一九二一年至一九二二年的華盛頓條的。根據海軍條約，主要海軍各國同意維持某種海軍比率。美國並在四强公的中應許不變更西太平羊的防區和軍事根據地的現狀，同時日本也在九國公的中應允尊重中國領土完整。這種條的雖早給日本破壞了，但美國依然是信守不渝的。（三）史汀生的不承認主義。這種政策是在一九三一年日本佔領滿洲以後宣佈的，曾聲明任何狀態，條的或協定，凡違反非戰公的條文，美國概不承認。</p>
<p>每一國家都有五種邊界。第一，在本國內的，是地理的邊界。其次，與地理邊界同其廣闊或超過地理邊界的，依照該國的面積與力量，成爲軍事的邊界，也就是藉着海陸空軍的力量用以防衛的邊界。其三，是經濟的邊界。例如，美國經濟的邊界當然包括巴西的咖啡和彼里維亞的錫。第四，是外交的邊界，大抵在保護地理邊界以外的本國利益，或應付該項利益所可遭遇的任何危險。第五，是道德的邊界，可以「開放門戶」這類詞令來說明。</p>
<p>普通言之，一國的外交邊界，在某一時期，可用來代表那一國的「政策」，而軍事的邊界卻代表那一國用以保衛那政策的「權力」。本文目的在討論這兩種邊界，對於美國在太平洋方面的種種利益，有什麼關係。</p>
<p>美國在太平洋的利益，可劃分爲好幾類：</p>
<p>（一）領土方面　美國在太平洋方面，保有好幾組島嶼，例如，夏威夷羣島，關島，中途島，威克島和撒摩亞羣島的一部，（菲律濱並未計入，因爲依據泰丁斯，麥杜菲法，菲島到一九四六年，便不再屬美國</p>
<p>（二）民族方面　旅居中國的美僑的有七千人，旅居日本的的有八千人。菲律濱也有許多美國僑民，荷屬南洋和海峽殖民地也有美僑少許（計荷　有　六百二十五名，海峽殖民地有五百二十五名）　其中以旅居中國的最爲美國國務院所關心</p>
<p>投資方面　投資的確數不容易獲悉。據合理的估計，在中國的有二萬五千萬美元，在日本的有三萬五千萬美元。但日本愈向中國進展，則美國在柬亞投資的機會將益受限制。無論怎樣，美國在遠東的金部投資額的有七萬五千萬美元，僅及美國國外投資總額百分之六而已。</p>
<p>（四）貿易方面　一九三八年，美國對華輸出總額的爲三千五百萬美元，自中國蝓入總額爲四千七百萬美元。美國對日輸出總額却非常龐大，幾達二萬四千寓美元，自日輸入總額（多數是絲和棉貨）爲一萬二千六百八十二萬美元。美國對日輸出多數可作爲戰爭物資，如機器，廢鐵，汽油之類，美國此舉無異幫助日本攻打中國了。至於美國對菲律濱輸出總額亦達八千六百萬美元，輸入總額則爲九千四百萬美元。</p>
<p>（五）航空方面、民用航空，不特沿襲現成的貿易路綫，抑目開闢新路綫，是爲未來的貿易開啟新門戶。泛美航空公司所辦的太平洋航空路綫，無論在商業方面或國威的價値，都很重要，卽在軍事上也有一種顯而易見的利益，因爲駕駛員不但獲得在太平洋上空飛行的訓練，抑且對於太平洋上空的氣候狀况等等，也可以獲得有價值的情報。由美洲經火奴魯魯，中途島，威克島，關島，而達馬尼拉的航空錢所建設的根據地，在軍事上殊爲重要。</p>
<p>（六）文化方面　美國在文化方面，尤其是在中國，有其重要的利益，如湘雅大學，北平協和醫科大學，和共他不可勝數的學校，敎曾，醫院之類。美國假使不願犧牲這種重要的有價値的利益，就決不能放棄它在遠東方面的政治勢力。</p>
<p>（七）政治方面　整個世界是互相連繫着的，允其在遠東方面，美國爲保持國力與威信起見，不能不負起政治上的責任</p>
<p>這一切都是美國所要保衛的。可是美國站在甚麽地位去保衛呢？</p>
<p>若要答復這個問題，首須討論誰是美國的假想敵。在國際政治的現勢中，若就遠東和太平洋區域而論，美國的假想敵只有日本一國。德國如其在歐戰中獲得勝利，局勢當然會完全改觀的。到那時，美國的　防務也不能不隨之完全改變了。但在目前，美國在太平洋方面須戒懼的惟有日本。這並不是說，日本蓄意在未來的某月某日對美開戰。頭腦淸醒的政論家多數承認，此種冒險舉動一時殊不可能。惟在目前情况之下，日本是能威脅太平洋方面美國利益的唯一國家，能醖釀太平洋戰爭的唯一强國。因此，美國當依據此種目標，去決定太平洋方面的軍事和海軍政策。</p>
<p>萬一日美間眞的不幸發生戰爭，日本將第一步打擊美國在華毫無掩護的前哨。美國駐華軍隊，將陷於孤立無援之境。自一九二七年以來，美國卽與他國合作，保護上海公共租界，在該處駐有海軍一千一百員名。在華北有美海軍五千員名，分駐於北平天津。長江一帶有美艦四艘，廣州也有一艘。亞洲艦隊，以上海或馬尼拉爲根據地，只有萬噸巡洋艦一艘，七千噸舊式巡洋艦一艘，過時的驅逐艦十二艘，潛水艇十二艘，小型輔助艦若干艘，美國在遠東並未駐泊主力艦或航空母艦。在過去，甚且沒有在海軍根據地夏威夷駐紥艦隊，爲的是不願開罪日本。現在不然，美國已在夏威夷的珍珠港集中全部艦隊了。</p>

<p>晨初滙市雖鬆、但人心尙稱堅穩、且多數均願照開盤買進、故開市於買方競購下、祗撳八元、金號互做二十兩、爲六千〇八十元、繼因銀號幫空頭加碼、續跌二十元、曾小至六千〇四十元、旋匯市忽緊、某銀號止塞力扒、加之金號吃胃奇濃、而錢兌業亦拖入有數、不久卽高至六千一百十元、後以另一錢兌業多頭出籠、散戶亦來跟賣、復退至六千〇九十元、十一時後因外滙續緊、某銀號再來猛扒補空、而斯時證劵幫與銀號亦互相收吸、收盤前遂漲至六千一百三十元、惟收盤因銀號幫反進爲出遂吿六千一百十五元收市、午後開市高起十元、證劵幫進金號二十兩、爲六千一百二十五元、嗣會小至六千一百二十元、未幾證劵幫復來搜買、銀號幫補空亦切、一度曾昂至六千一百叫十三元、後貿者驟减、卽吿回降、而不久某銀號重來放空、一時缺乏維持、頓跌至六千一百〇五元、入後經證劵幫再來拉提、復升至六千一百二十五兀、收市則吿六千一百二十元、結果比上日回漲五十二元、全天一百〇三元上落、現金號之本脾金售出價、照烚赤較高十數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>首飾金亦掛高十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出初時未動、迨至午刻掛高十元、計大同行改懸六百三十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低三十元光景、</p>

<p>昨外幣市况、烚赤盤旋略漲、英美金鎊因亦各漲一元、英金票因需要激减、市價回落三角、美金票始則繼續趨軟、一度退至十八元二角半、嗣因滙豐對黑市美滙收胃奇佳、人心又昂、市價步漲、一度抬至十八元五角三分、卒爲十八元四角八分、比上日終升八分、計港票略疲一分、日金票各方供給忽旺、市價疲落、晚市退至一元四角九分、朝鮮票供求仍勻、市價站平、晚市仍站一元一角八分原價、</p>

<p>昨日洋米因徘徊幾朝、一般認爲脚地堅固、出手活動、頃刻形勢遂緊繼之補空頻頻、賣戶喊聲立高、不過底盤已貴、來源不絕、安南問題已引不起業外囤戶之垂注、至於實銷久無暢胃、因此結果祇拉起五六七角、卽英華司原包亦無新興大戶顧問、昨開出一百多噸、二號西貢七十七元七角、較前日大七角、二號暹邏七十七元半、亦大半元、全日現米交易則有七千包、行情則火絞七十元、二號西貢六十六元、二號暹邏六十四元三角、六十四兀、小絞六十四元、米菉五十六元、</p>

<p>麵粉昨告平穩、華粉廠盤屹立未動、而連日本街屹立未動、而連日本街需要頗佳、各廠供給略見增多、但現粉尙屬供不敷求、惟回籠貨已受巨額洋粉成交之影響、鳳凰牌現粉價亦與廠盤相仿而運入租界爲難、本街方面、亦以貨决不甚歡迎、廠粉客盤仍須十八元三五角、華北客銷、因靑島來貨、叉有統制謠傳、進胃亦轉呆懈、故市面平坦異常、粉市漲風漸吿平息云、</p>
<p>小麥昨市平淡、內地到貨大都指定解送日廠、隨市作價、貨方每思扳俏、卒難如願、而運日粉市已入坦途、麥市亦雞提高、日廠收進數量僅有一二千包、華廠以洋麥有到、並無吸收、各貨價格亦鮮榮辱、</p>

<p>現棉情形帶堅、因人心大都望好、揆其原因、不外乎謂新棉搬運困難、然英德互相轟炸劇烈、歐洲市場停頓、印度棉祇得向東方謀出路、外匯如果放長、印棉價仍有趨廉之望也、所以廠方需要不旺、成交未盛、市價上升亦迂迴也、</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐約棉市晨初先因投機者之購買而漲、後因現貨交易良好、及一部份因政府對於棉花之抵押將提高、故同業購買異常踴躍、結果收盤價格、較之上日漲八九及十餘磅音不等、印度連同頂測跌一羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日又較趨靜寂、仍因市上存底不豐、各同業擬待善價而沾也、廠方購意雖濃、但强欲搜購售價低廉者、故亦未能購得也、</p>

<p>公共租界英商電車公司中國公共汽車公司、及法租界法商水電公司工人相相繼罷工後、上海市商會會函工部局及各公司、希望迅謀合理之解決、聞勞資雙方、對商會之意見、表示尊重、勞方巳準備手續、將請工部局華董虞洽卿·袁履登·及工業科調停、新聲社記者昨向虞洽卿及工業科探悉、至昨晚截止、尙未得工人之正式請求、對調停問題、表示願意接受、使公用事業之罷工風潮早日解決、以維界內公共交通及社會治安、</p>
<p>英商電車可望解決</p>
<p>英商電車公　工人、於本月二十日起罷工後、雖經兩度談判、因增加工資問題、未得解決、今勞資雙方、均願誠意談判、所以該項罷工風潮、卽有圓滿解決之望、聞工人提出之四項先決條件、公司對第一條已允增加津貼二角、米貼一角五分、（合計每月以三十日計算為十元零五角、）而工人巳讓步為十三元、第二條、無故不得開除工人、公司巳允接受、第三條、罷工期內工資、公司允給二天、第四條、勞資條件雙方允暫保留、</p>
<p>公共汽車昨日會談</p>
<p>公共和界英商公共汽車於二十四日罷工後、連日勞資雙方未有接觸、怕雙方感情、素稱融洽、故亦未有擴大工潮之徵象、昨日下午二時、勞方代表十二人、赴南京路外灘沙遜大厦一百十一號公司總寫字間、會晤公司代表車務總管張德蘭、勞方代表當將二十四日會議決定之四項先決條件、向公司提出、並表示勞方出於萬不得巳之苦衷、願與公司作誠意談判、俾獲得合理之解決、張德蘭表示、公司方面對勞方之生活安定、無時不予以關切、　而求改善之方、故對此次工潮、深為諒解、惟所提條件、本人無權決定、允於晚間召開董事會、提出討論、並約定今日上午九時、聽取消息、勞方代表當卽辭出、雙方會談經過、意見接近、故預料如今日公司答復圓滿、下午雙方卽可開始正式談判、商討先行復工辦法、於一二日內、或司恢復交通、</p>
<p>法商電車進行商洽</p>
<p>法商水電公司工人、提出要求改良待遇條件十六條後、已由工會正式推派代表四人赴公司進行談判、一俟譯成法文、並經縝密考慮後、再行答復、聞工人方面、對巳提出之十六條件、全係根據事實和平要求、公司應予以合理之邀准、否則、應由資方負完全責任、至於二路七路·十路有軌電車、昨晨仍由武裝巡捕保護之下、繼續行駛搭客、廬家灣總公司及工廠、以及各路車站、仍由華越巡捕駐守、嚴密保護、昨午十一時五十五分、二路與七路電車三輛駛至霞飛路　　父路口之際、被人投琉璜彈、當時爆裂、乘客八名受傷、其詳細經過、見本版「法租界電車被投彈起紛擾」一段內、</p>
<h3 id="c50">法租界電車被投彈起紛擾　男女乘客受傷者計八人　當場已拘獲嫌欵犯三名 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>昨日中午十　時五十九分、有法商二路第十七號有軌電車一輛、由西朝東、駛停於霞飛咱金神父路站口時、其後適有七路第四號電車接踵而至、不料斯時站上突有男子數名、以手中之紙盒、向車內投擲、該項紙盒內藏琉璜彈、拋落車內、轟然一聲、立時爆炸、一時濃烟密佈、火燄甚烈、秩序大亂、</p>
<p>乘客逃命交通停頓</p>
<p>車內乘客、見此突如其來之事件、莫不大驚、少壯者均由車窗內跳出逃命、一時傾跌於站上者頗衆、婦孺等輩更被擠踏、喊聲震天、交通亦因之完全停頓、結果由崗捕電知捕房及救火會、當由捕房派大批中西探捕到來、維持秩序、並將傷者車送醫院醫治、旋救火會亦到達施救、將烈燄撲滅、</p>
<p>彈片四射八人受傷</p>
<p>當肇事時、大部乘客均因輕傷分頭自往療治、其比較傷重者、事後查悉計（一）嚴吳氏、（六十歲、蘇州人、住西法華鎭、）（二）王世喬、（廿一歲、本地人、住敏體尼陰路同康里六十五號）、（三）錢吳氏（卅六歲、）安徽人、住辣斐德路一四七五號）（四）錢吳氏之女錢琦蘭、（十七歲）（五）李士松、（卅四歲、本地人、住八仙橋、）（六）楊金妹、（廿八歲、本地人、住汶林路三四六號、）（七）羅香槎、（卅四歲、上虞人、住奧和和路四十九號、）（八）意士平、（廿歲、紹興人、住西愛咸斯路六九〇弄一號、）　八名、均被彈傷脚部、除錢女及王世喬傷重留院外、其餘均經醫生包紥後出院、</p>
<p>當獲三人押候偵查</p>
<p>事後、捕房曾在該處施行警戒、並拘獲嫌欵犯三名、帶返捕房偵查、車內彈片等、亦檢回查驗、據悉、該項琉璜彈、係私製者、以形似酒瓶之玻璃瓶、內儲烈性琉璜等物、故極易爆　、並聞當時車內男女乘客衣服被燃燒亦大不乏人、現該案捕房已在偵查中、</p>
<p>法警務處公表消息</p>
<p>又法租界警務處、昨發出公表消息云、今日（二十七日）午刻、法商電車行駛至霞飛路金神父路口時、有一乘客、將滿儲燐質之玻　瓶放置三等車內、一時火光熊熊、當時被其他乘客窺見、一時拳足交加、幸由警捕干涉、得免於難、該乘客原係法商電車公司之司機者、但參加罷工、渠在捕房供稱、該項儲有燐質之瓶、係於今晨在滬西取得、擬用以焚燬行駛之電車者、同時後面電車內發現同樣燃燒物、幸由救火人員熄滅、未肇巨禍、但有華人八名受傷、為加緊戒備起見、法警務處增派警捕在各電車停站常川駐守、</p>
<p>戒備情形更為嚴秘</p>
<p>昨日金神父路發生一燒夷彈一傷男女乘客八名之事件後、公董局警務處及捕房方面、以不幸事件、日有發生、對乘客安全、界內治安、均有莫大關係、故昨日對各路戒備情形、更形嚴厲、工廠機棧、亦加派越捕站崗保護、砲車出動梭巡各馬路、川流不息、而在金神父路一帶之警戒、尤為周詳、對停車口之保護、亦較其他為嚴、蓋自罷工以來、有軌電車之行駛者寥寥無幾、乘客之擁擠、十倍於昔、自不能予以疏忽</p>
<h3 id="c51">小工與糞夫　昨亦罷工 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>工務處小工</p>
<p>工部局工務處雇有小工一千五百名左右、此輩工人、向在工務處担任築路條路等工作、詎昨日上午八時許、該項小工、正在從事工作之際、在小沙渡路一帶、突有策動罷工者上前干涉、迫令罷工、以致工務處小工一部份約六百名左右、停止工作、至說下午幸未見蔓延、外傳工人方面業已提出要求增加工資等條件、工務處業已允每人增加三分、工人因表示太少、聞雙方將再談判之說、惟平明社記者於昨日下午四時、向租界當局方面探悉、據　工務處罷工小工、迄至昨日下午、並未有條件提出、亦尙未作若何談判、</p>
<p>糞夫淸道夫</p>
<p>又公共租界西區垃圾車夫及糞夫、昨亦有少數工人罷工、檳榔路戈登路馬崎路以及沿西蘇州河一帶、垃圾糞汁、滿地狼藉、以致臭氣觸鼻、行人裹足、其在麥根路淸潔所附近有糞車十數輛、翻倒於馬路中、圾垃散滿馬路、並有若干車輛、已被擊壞、捕房得報後、當派大批巡捕到塲彈壓、但此輩煽動份子、業已逸去無蹤、乃召救火車用水衝去糞汁、據向公共租界當局方面探詢、據稱、淸道夫及糞車夫之罷工者、係極少數、</p>
<p>要訊彙誌</p>

<p>本埠兩租界內公用車輛發生罷工風潮之後、因之兩租界關於水電兩項重要公用事業之謠諑甚熾、幾至滿城風雨、大有人為備之景象、實際上兩租界水電工人、均深明大義、無有甘心為他人所利用者、故仍照常工作、昨據平明社記者探悉、現兩租界自來水公司、均已採取預備方法、界內自來水供給、絕對不致中斷、茲將所得各情誌後、</p>
<p>防軍保護</p>
<p>法租界自來水廠、設於呂班路底之廬家　、該廠水源、抽自南方高昌廟附近之黃浦江中、惟該廠自戰事變生後、另建有鉅大自流井多所、亦可供作水源、現因外間謠言甚熾、法　局乃於昨晨起、派有武裝陸軍二十餘名駐守於該廠四週、以資戒備、並悉該廠工作工人、亦巳開始在廠中住宿暫不外出、且該廠機器、係迪塞　式引擎發動、祇須少數人管理、</p>
<p>準備周密</p>
<p>至於公共租界自來水、係由上海自來水公司經營、據租界當局之關係方面及公司方面之表示、公共租界自來水、卽使發生工潮、但租界當局與公司方面巳獲得共同維持之辦法、絕對不致使水流中斷、故界內居民、切弗輕信謠言、卽使外來任何企圖、自來水決不中斷、</p>

<p>滬市糧食情况、投機操縱、擾亂市情、抬高售價、連日行盤價格、繼續增漲不巳、昨（二十七）日市塲，又以滬防航綫暫告中斷、以致更爲緊張、洋杜米再見績漲、惟聞香港方面、尚有鉅額洋米將運滬接濟、現已有米　人員、進行接洽購運</p>
<p>繼續評價</p>
<p>米糧評價委員會前因米市演於混亂局面、該會自認力不勝任、爰經議決函請兩租界當局、要求指示方针、迄今半月有餘、該會在此半月期內、對於會務、似已無法進行、致暫告停頓、探悉租界當局、昨日已分別函復該會、囑其繼續行使職權、評定市塲米價、並允作取締囤積居奇、壟斷米價之有效協助、</p>
<p>議有辦法</p>
<p>昨據關係方面透露消息、两租借當局自接評價委員會函請後、認爲情事重大、會作數度會商、並委派人員向米業各領袖、詢國內外米糧到銷存底實在情形、聞已議有具體辦法、決將付諸實施、聞兩當局對於上海整個米市、莫不寄予嚴密之重視、故此次自接評價會函請後、遷延迄今、始作復示、</p>
<p>昨市又漲</p>
<p>米行茶會市塲昨晨七時半開做後、人心卽　上游、市價一律看高、一般投機米蠢、猛抬不遺餘力、人頭簇簇、鼠竄不定、市塲除洋米開價外、國米似已無法購得、洋米初市開價、較諸前市僅好起數角、近午散戶推波助澜、結果洋米　盤見新高價、一號西貢竟開價達七十元許、但有須注意者、上開米價、係正式洋米、而市上出售、率多攙雜、價目自然不同、購者宜注意辨別、</p>

<h3 id="c75">新加坡的憂悒 <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— 史弢</p>
<p>新加坡之建設者史丹福拉法士的鋼像在亞細亞洲的最南端直立於黃昏的中央，過去，在他的側影，閃耀着一層燦爛的榮光，而今日，在他同樣的側影里，我們却祇能找出憂慮着祖國戰亂的表情。</p>
<p>當路燈已在昏黯的街頭發生亮光的時候，在面臨海岸的公園的揶子樹下，聽着微同帶來的波風，馬來的馭者靠着馬車，彈起了他愛用的手風琴，充滿着哀愁的歌聲也緊隨着流瀉了：</p>
<p>『輝粕的太陽</p>
<p>無邊的靑色的海岸</p>
<p>揶子是那樣爽颯</p>
<p>在空中幌蕩</p>
<p>一切都這般幸福</p>
<p>唯有</p>
<p>馬來的馬車舖不存一絲希望』</p>
<p>那低弱的音律，誘出了來往馬來人的眼淚，誘出了馬來人昔日的舊夢。</p>
<p>自從去秋歐戰爆發以來，這樣和平的新加坡風景也漸漸地變了她的容貌。瞧，街上巡邏兵士是多起來了，島的每個地方都在要　化起來。新加坡河畔，有年輕的義勇兵掮着搶，忙於訓練，商業中心拉夫士廣塲邊的多數商店，在沿岸防備的名義下，都强制撤　了。</p>
<p>在另一方面，嚴重的燈火管制和防空演習也不時實行着，然而因為新加坡住民的人種複雜，市政當局便發生了言語混的困難。本來自古迄今，新加坡一直是塊人種展覽的塲所，走上街道或是廣塲，你可見到黑鬚滿臉包着頭巾的印度人，有塗牛糞於額之習慣的暹羅人，支配南洋一帶的華僑，馬來人，菲列賓人……在這里通用着廿六個國家的言語。</p>
<p>萬一新加坡被戰神光臨的時節，市政當局要散發防毒面具因此也非以廿六國的國語來公示不可。但困難處是馬來語的燈火管制在阿刺伯語中却相反地是解除管制的意思，諸如此類的現象，而是不勝枚舉。所以現在市政當局以標準馬來語開始訓練各種民族；也　最近的宣傳是過於有效了，那愚誠的印度人等也感到飛機的威脅，在黑暗的防空演習之夜，燃了火，跪在阿拉神的面前祈禱。</p>
<p>新加坡是如此的瀰漫着戰霧，賽利塔要塞當然是不容忽視的。過去，賽利塔不過是柔佛海峽的一個漁邨，但今日，已成英國空軍的根據地了，離賽利塔不遠，還有處有名的海軍根據地，那里有橄欖樹，椰子樹的樹枝縱橫交叉着，熱帶的蔓藤繁茂地懸掛在這些樹枝，正替這軍事要塞為僞裝成太古似的叢林，這四周佈置着通電流的鐵絲網，而至每處都有印度警察或是馬來兵把守着。山地上敷設着數門十五吋口徑的大砲，密林中埋藏着汽油，據說有三百萬噸，果如是，則英國的大艦隊　朝在新加坡集中的塲合，也足够一年的使用了</p>
<p>英國海軍的遠東專家德曼斯少將曾說：「在東方失去新加坡的時候，在英國當是太陽沒落的時候。」目下的情勢眞是一刻比一刻迫切，英國在新加坡記了六億鎊的要塞建築費，造着巨大的船塢，裝着　距離砲…她該是不會輕而將這遠東的據點輕易讓人吧！</p>
<p>於此，新加坡巳再入是混雜各色的人種的樂園，再漸漸患着她的憂悒症了。</p>

<p>一九三九年一月號，看到歐洲的三個小國對於藥物一律禁止刋登廣吿，而看到近來上海報紅上滿紙的藥品和補品廣吿，不禁大受感觸。覺得中國人對健康一事太不注意，有時竟以生命為兒戲，這種錯誤心理，不可不趕快改正。</p>
<p>這三小國政府所採行的方法如下：</p>
<p>丹麥國：自一九三二年起，法律規定嚴厲禁止各種藥物在報章雜誌上刋登廣吿。但在內外科醫生，牙醫師，化學家等所出版之刋物上，得允許登載藥物廣吿（因該國政府認為醫師等有專門學識，凡經過醫師等認可而登載之廣吿，當無害於人民。）</p>
<p>挪威國：自一九三〇年起卽有法律明文規定，嚴禁藥品補藥等之隨便刋廣吿，並且，藥物非經國立醫藥學會（Medieal　Board）及健康部（Ministry　of　Health）之騐定，不得出售。故凡報章雜誌的拒絕刮登藥物廣吿，除非此項藥品已經國立醫學會檢驗准許發行，而此項廣告亦經國立醫藥學會認可。</p>
<p>在挪威國，藥品製成後，須，　呈送國立醫藥學會檢驗，若得其允准，然後能發售，售價亦得經該會審核，若該會認為過高，亦可將其减低。若藥商預備刋登廣吿，則須將廣吿之底稿連同呈請該會審核。若該會認為廣吿上言過其實，可削改其字句。</p>
<p>瑞典國：法律上有明文規定，非經醫師親筆所開藥方上寫明，藥　不得出售含有毒質之藥物。</p>
<p>凡藥物之發售，須經過健康部檢驗核准。</p>
<p>從上面看來，這三國的政府對藥物之製　和發售，都十分注意，檢驗審核也十分愼重，因為這是有關於國人民健康的問題。丹麥國政府則對醫師亦很尊重，凡是藥物經醫師認可後，便能在該醫師所出版的刋物上登載廣吿。這是他們尊重醫師的人格。</p>
<p>中國還不大看見醫學刋物，所以一時要禁止藥物在普通刋物上登廣吿恐怕還是辦不到的。不過為了國民的健康起見，政府及地方當局對市上出售藥品的審查，似乎是緊要的事</p>

<p>第八章　捉住了兩個人</p>
<p>霍桑又說道：「趙先生，你能不能坦白些，把佻經過的事情自動的解釋一下？還是你一定要到了另一個地點才肯說話？」</p>
<p>越伯雄依舊沒有說話，却把嚴冷的目光移轉到我身上。</p>
<p>霍桑把自己的假鬚和黑眼鏡除掉了，放在袋裏，一壁說道：「我想你總認識我。鄙姓霍，單名一個桑子。這一位是包朗先生，你總也聽得過。我們還是用眞面目相見。好不好？」</p>
<p>霍桑提起右手，好像要給他除掉嘴脣上的假鬚。趙伯雄忽自動舉起右手，先除了眼鏡，又在自己嘴脣一揭，那假鬚立卽落在他的手裏。他忽而自動開口了。</p>
<p>他發出一種冷澀的聲浪，說道：「你們是私家偵探？是不是？」　　霍桑微微一彎腰，臉上露着微笑，却不答話，眼睛在瞧趙伯雄的皮鞋。</p>
<p>他又說：「你們憑着什麽理由，竟用武器控制我？侵害我的自由？」他順手將眼鏡等向旁邊的桌面上一丟。</p>
<p>霍桑仍帶着笑容說道：「我已說過了啊，就為着那兩粒子彈。一粒子彈你打死了王麗　……」</p>
<p>趙伯雄不等霍桑說完，忽發出一聲冷笑，　帶的是他的鼻子裏一聲哼。這一笑一哼，含着一股冷峭的　味。似乎比答語還有力量。竟使霍桑怔了一怔。</p>
<p>霍桑作詫異聲道：「什麽，我說錯了嗎？」</p>
<p>趙伯雄露着一種輕鄙的神氣。自言自語地說：「好一個獨具隻眼的大偵探……」</p>
<p>正在這時候，房門突然推開，倪金　直闖進來。他手裏也執着手槍，後面還跟着兩個身材魁梧的探員。我覺得我的任務可以吿一個段落，便將我的手槍收回了。</p>
<p>霍桑點點頭說：「倪探長，我早飯也沒有吃，五臟殿快鬧翻了。這個人交給你罷……包朗，你雖吃過粥，可是你的神經緊張了半天，也得休息一下哩。走罷。」</p>
<p>他和我走到門口，他又站住了向倪金壽說話。</p>
<p>「倪探長，桌子上的那柄手槍，缺少兩顆子彈，你收好了。」他又要走出去的樣子。忽又再度停留。「喂他身上也許還有第二支槍，你得小心些。」他說完了才首先走出門去。</p>
<p>當我跟他出門口的時候，也回頭瞧一瞧。倪金壽仍把手槍擬注着趙伯雄，兩個探夥早已分立在趙伯雄的左右，一個在開始搜索，另一個已摸出一副光亮亮的銅觸，正要套到趙伯雄的腕上去。趙伯雄却並沒有抗拒的傾向。　（一二〇）</p>

<h3 id="c80">音樂與療病 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— 鏞</p>
<p>音樂與療病有什麽關係？讀者們看到了題目後不免會發生這種疑問的。的確，在以前，無論是醫界中的人，大家都一致承認音樂祗可以作為一種陶冶性情及調劑精神的東西。可是，到了今日，巳有人發現說音樂本身有療病的功用存在，並且還舉了幾件現成的事實來證明。</p>
<p>美國本薛文尼亞省，有一個女子，因為患了痺病，雙足不能行動，但是自聽了四次無綫電中所播的音樂節目後，竟因此得以恢復其原有的機能。又有一位軍人，參與第一次世界大戰時，因為在前綫受砲彈爆炸的震驚，變成了一個啞吧；後來，聽了人家唱的意大利名曲，自己於無意間居然亦能開口唱歌了。再有一家肺病療養院，據一位醫生報吿，院中病人的脈博及熱度，如果他們有高尙的音樂聽過後，往往會有進步的情形顯現。舉這幾件事的人是一位美國音樂界中的前輩—哈雷脫西摩夫人（Mrs．Harriet　Seymour）亦就是發現音樂可以直接療病的第一個人，她在紐約組織了一個名為慈善濟助音樂療病的委員會。上年度中曾由該會的發起，分在三十七所醫院中舉行過九百七十五次音樂的演奏，結果有四萬四千零六位病人獲得不同的影響。</p>
<p>有一次，西摩夫人向報界發表談話謂：「據我多來的經驗，我知道某種疾病的確可以用某種音樂來治療。史蒂芬福斯德的樂曲和匈牙利及西班牙的舞曲是可以治療精神病或神經病。莎姍（Sousa）的進行曲及各國的民間曲是可以治療痺病。銅樂隊的合奏曲，如果不過於緊張，能够給患有心臟病者感到一種快慰。古典音樂則有帮助消除病人痛苦的效能。其他如孟德爾沙（Mendelssohn）的「春之歌」，連奏幾遍後，竟可以使一般有失眠者很甜蜜的入睡夢；華爾滋曲，對於患肺火者是很有利的。」</p>
<p>音樂與療病發生了連繫性的關係，該是屬於病家的福音吧；而在另一方面說，亦眞是替音樂界放了一支新的光芒呢！</p>

<p>Berlin – It is hereby announced that the official documents of the German, Italian, and Japanese tripartite pact were signed here this afternoon at 1 PM. (Haitong Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Berlin – Japan has today joined the German-Italian Axis and signed a military and economic alliance with Germany and Italy. This historic alliance of the three omnipotent nations was signed in Hitler’s presence at 1:12 PM in the German capital. This alliance, designed by Germany to hinder American actions and divide the British Empire, will have a tremendous impact on the future of the Far East. The signing of the agreement resembled the signing or holding of the German-Italian military alliance last year. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, who represented Italy in the signing, arrived in Berlin at 12:30 PM, two and a half hours later than expected. Ciano was accompanied by many experts on treaties from the Italian Foreign Ministry. In front of the Brandenburg Gate, in addition to the German and Italian flags, a Japanese flag was also hung, and small Japanese flags were distributed to German schoolchildren in the streets by the authorities. (United Press Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Berlin – The full text of the official document of the German, Italian, and Japanese tripartite pact is as follows: Germany, Italy, and Japan, believing that the prerequisite for lasting peace is that all nations in the world obtain appropriate positions, have decided to cooperate with each other in the efforts of the three countries in the "Greater East Asia" and the European regions. The main goal of the three countries is to build a new order and increase the prosperity and welfare of all countries involved. The three governments hope to cooperate with countries in other regions to achieve the ultimate desire for a peaceful world. Therefore, the governments of Germany, Italy, and Japan have agreed on the following articles:</p>
<p>Article 1: Japan recognizes and respects the leading position of Germany and Italy in building a new European order in Europe.</p>
<p>Article 2: Germany and Italy recognize and respect the leading position of Japan in building a "New Order in Greater East Asia" in Asia.</p>
<p>Article 3: Germany, Italy, and Japan agree to cooperate and strive according to the above guidelines. If one of the signatory countries encounters an attack from a country not currently involved in the European war or the Sino-Japanese war, the three countries shall provide mutual assistance in political, economic, and military affairs.</p>
<p>Article 4: To fulfill this agreement, the joint technical committee appointed by the governments of Germany, Italy, and Japan shall meet as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Article 5: Germany, Italy, and Japan declare that the above provisions do not affect the existing political relations of the signatory countries with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Article 6: This agreement shall take effect immediately after signing and shall be valid for a period of ten years. Upon the request of any signatory country, the three countries shall conduct negotiations regarding the extension of the validity period at an appropriate time before the expiration of this agreement. The representatives of the three countries, authorized by their respective governments, have signed and sealed this document in triplicate in Berlin on September 27, 1940. (Haitong Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Berlin – It is generally believed that this pact replaces the previous Anti-Comintern Pact of the three countries. However, it is noteworthy that the Anti-Comintern Pact was specifically aimed at the Soviet Union, and the current pact has added special recognition to the new relationship with the Soviet Union. Diplomatic circles here feel that Article 3 of the pact means that Germany and Italy will provide assistance to Japan. (Reuters Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Declaration of the Three Signatory Nations</p>
<p>Berlin – German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop personally received Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Japanese Ambassador Kurusu to participate in the signing ceremony of the German, Italian, and Japanese tripartite pact. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop delivered a speech, stating that the governments of Germany, Italy, and Japan have decided to sign an important pact. After reading the full text of the pact in German, Italian, and Japanese, he declared on behalf of the German government that Germany, since 1933, has hoped to modify the status quo peacefully, and the German people also have the right to govern their natural territory. The National Socialist Party has long decided to obtain the right to survive for the German people. The tripartite pact signed on the order of Führer Hitler is a solemn declaration of the united alliance of the three countries to realize common interests. The purpose of this pact is for Germany and Italy to lead the construction of a new European order, and for Japan to lead the construction of a "New Order in Greater East Asia." The foundation of this pact is not only the friendship of the three countries but also the common interests of the three countries. This pact is not aimed at any country but is aimed at steps taken by those who incite war and attempt to prolong or expand the war. This pact is a military alliance treaty of the three major powers, which will help the construction of a new order in Europe and "Greater East Asia" and make world peace a reality as soon as possible. Any country that wishes to join this group will be sincerely welcomed, but those who attempt to interfere in the solution of European or East Asian issues, or attack one of the three countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan, will encounter the combined power of 250,000,000 people from the three countries. Ciano also delivered a speech, stating that the new pact is a bulwark against the expansion of war, but the importance of the pact transcends the current situation and represents the permanent unity of the three countries. The Japanese ambassador declared that the ultimate goal of the pact is to build world peace, a universal and lasting peace based on justice, and hopes to cooperate with countries with the same goals and implementing the same plans. The pact for Germany, Italy, and Japan</p>
<p>Berlin – Italian Foreign Minister Ciano read a document regarding the German, Italian, and Japanese tripartite pact, stating that this pact has proven the political, economic, and military cooperation and common interests and goals of Germany, Italy, and Japan. The three countries must seek space for survival, but they are rejected by countries that monopolize world resources. The unity of the three countries is not a temporary diplomatic strategy but a manifestation of history. This unity can be found in history for common causes and goals. This pact is simple and clear: Germany and Italy and Japan mutually recognize the leading position in building a new order. Germany, Italy, and Japan have no intention of threatening other countries but aim to prevent the expansion of war. This pact not only represents the current unity but also has a decisive value for the future. (Haitong Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Reactions from Britain and the United States</p>
<p>London – Britain has given its first reaction to the German, Italian, and Japanese alliance, saying that the treaty is essentially a vague treaty. Well-informed sources say that, from the British perspective, it is difficult to predict how much the treaty will affect the current situation. They also say that it is unlikely that Germany and Italy will take strong actions against Britain by uniting with Japan. They also cited the US loan of US$250 million to China and President Roosevelt's ban on steel exports to the Axis powers and Japan, saying that people should assess the gains and losses of democratic countries in the future. Officials here also say that Britain is not afraid of such an alliance agreement. (United Press Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Washington – Unofficial circles in the United States have immediately reacted to the German, Italian, and Japanese agreement, saying that the agreement, from this perspective, is merely a fact that will last for at most five years. The State Department is unwilling to issue an immediate comment on this, but authoritative sources say that the purpose of this agreement is undoubtedly to deal with the United States.

<h3 id="e2">The Lingering and Unresolved Labor Dispute in Public Transportation <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Since the tram and bus workers in the Public Concession successively went on strike, followed by the tram and bus workers in the French Concession taking the same action, although a small number of trams in the French Concession occasionally managed to operate to benefit pedestrians, it can be said that the entire public transportation system within the Shanghai Concession has been completely paralyzed due to the strike. The profound and serious impact this has had on millions of citizens is self-evident; therefore, everyone urgently hopes for an early resolution of the labor dispute, but the aloofness of both sides seems to indicate that there is no hope of resuming work for the time being. Labor disputes in a certain industry or commerce only affect those related to that particular industry. For example, if the staff of a pharmacy goes on strike, there is still no need to worry about not being able to buy medicine, so the impact on the general public is minimal. However, since public utilities are for public use, both labor and management should not only consider their own interests but also the interests of the public. How can they allow the innocent to suffer when a fire breaks out at the city gate? Therefore, if the labor dispute is prolonged for even one day, the general public's displeasure with both labor and management in public utilities will increase day by day. The concession authorities, who usually show great consideration for increasing tram and bus fares and readily approve them, should now take effective measures to address the inconvenience caused to citizens by the public transportation workers' strike and seek a fair solution to facilitate an early resumption of work for the benefit of travelers. This is what the general public desires.</p>
<p>The reason for the strike must be simple and necessary, which can be summarized as an economic one. Given the current increase in prices and the daily expenses exceeding income, except for a very small number of wealthy and leisured classes, everyone feels the hardship of life. Therefore, the motivation of transportation workers to maintain their necessary survival and hope to improve their original treatment to cope with their current life is pure, and their demands are out of necessity. They have no choice but to resort to the workers' ultimate weapon – the strike. Considering the situation, we cannot help but sympathize with them to a considerable extent. However, transportation workers, who are responsible for maintaining public transportation and facilitating public movement, should also consider the inconvenience that the public feels after the strike. If they can restore the original means of transportation as soon as possible to facilitate public movement, what will the public think? The labor side may think that the responsibility does not lie with the workers but with the management: if the management can accommodate the demands of the labor side, they can resume work in the evening after hearing the order in the morning. This is certainly true, but we believe that the negotiation of conditions has its necessary process; how to establish an agreement that both parties can agree to cannot be done in an instant. However, everything must have its principles. Once the principles are established, the details can be easily resolved. Therefore, we believe that once the principles can be agreed upon by both parties, work should be resumed immediately, and the detailed agreement can be left to the negotiation of the representatives of both parties.</p>
<p>Currently, foreign businesses often have a common misconception: they are diligent in maintaining their profit standards. Therefore, when foreign exchange shrinks, they always ignore the burden of the public and increase surcharges and raise prices. They may not have the sincerity of sharing weal and woe with the production workers. It is said that people only know propriety when they are well-fed. When people's lives are unsustainable, they will no longer hesitate to instigate trouble and raise their arms. Moreover, since labor disputes are called "tides," it is easy to stir up trouble! If the management usually neglects to pay attention to the living conditions of the workers, and when the labor dispute arises, they cannot find a solution and only express deep regret to the customers, what good will it do? Even refusing to meet with the representatives of the labor side will only further distance them from a solution.</p>
<p>We believe that labor-management disputes are inevitable, but both labor and management should remember that although their positions may be different, their interests are ultimately the same. Therefore, the labor side should not ask for anything other than what is necessary for their survival and what they are entitled to. The management should handle reasonable demands in good faith, adopting them as much as possible, and clearly stating the reasons for not adopting them so that the labor side knows that their demands are excessive. In today's situation, there is superficial prosperity, but the inside is actually empty.</p>
<p>Mr. [Hotsumi Ozaki] stated that [Yosuke] Matsuoka is a "strong character" and can use an iron will like Hitler to deal with any weakness of foreign countries. However, Mr. Hotsumi also stated that Matsuoka is also a realist and will not underestimate the strength of the Anglo-American alliance. Mr. Hotsumi also stated that Matsuoka's actions, whether stubborn or wrong, are based on self-confidence, so the result of his actions will either be hopeful or dangerous.

<p>British Government Encouraged by the United States to Reopen the Burma Road</p>
<p>Washington – The new US loan to China has already led to speculation here about what steps the US government will take to express its opposition to Japan's advance into Vietnam. After President Roosevelt announced the ban on scrap iron exports, people here are increasingly convinced that Britain, encouraged by the United States, will reopen the Burma Road when the three-month period expires in October. After China receives the new US loan, it can continuously obtain military supplies and other goods from the United States. (Reuters Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – The three-month suspension of the Yunnan-Burma Road is about to expire. Various civic diplomatic groups here have successively visited British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, stating the Chinese people's deep hope that Britain will unconditionally open the road on schedule. Kerr has been in frequent contact with various parties in recent days to listen to opinions on opening the road in order to report to the London government. (Havas Telegram, 27th)</p>

<p>Washington</p>
<p>Chinese Ambassador to Washington, Dr. Hu Shih, publicly accepted US$92,000 in charitable funds for China relief at the Chinese Embassy yesterday afternoon. This fund was jointly raised by the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China and the Women's New China Committee. Over five hundred people, including Mrs. Roosevelt and others, participated in the ceremony. In addition, Dr. Hu Shih also received a beautifully bound "Book of Hope," which listed the names of one hundred American socialites, each of whom had donated more than one hundred dollars to support China. Pearl Buck presented the funds on behalf of the crowd. After accepting them, Ambassador Hu immediately delivered a short speech, expressing a strong hope for China's resistance against Japan. The Ambassador said, "Today is China Red Cross Day."

<p>Chongqing: According to Kunming sources, Chinese troops along the Vietnamese border remain stationed within the territory. The border region of Yunnan Province was placed under martial law on September 25th. Military authorities are conducting rigorous searches of people passing through Hekou and Maripo (transliteration). To disrupt the Japanese rear in Vietnam, Chinese troops are currently applying pressure on the Japanese near Fangcheng, on the coast of Guangdong Province. After the Chinese troops recaptured the city, the Japanese immediately launched a counterattack, entering the city on the evening of September 23rd, but the following night the city was retaken by the Chinese troops. Kunming is currently calm as usual, and foreigners have not evacuated. However, all central government agencies are preparing to leave, with most relocating to Sichuan Province. Residents have been warned to evacuate voluntarily; those who do not comply will be forcibly evacuated. Merchants are currently transporting goods out of the city. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Kunming sources recently reported that Long Yun, Chairman of Yunnan Province, has ordered the mobilization of all manpower and resources to protect Yunnan Province from invasion. According to a Da Gong Bao correspondent stationed in Yunnan, Chiang Kai-shek's temporary headquarters in Yunnan has ordered strict inspections of travelers from Vietnam to prevent spies.

<p>Chongqing: Chinese sources are currently confused about developments in Vietnam. The Chinese side yesterday granted the request of the Vietnamese authorities and dispatched a special plane to the Vietnamese border to transport Vietnamese representatives to Chongqing for discussions. However, although the Chinese plane reached the border, no representatives arrived. It is reported that the Vichy government has declined Chinese assistance to Vietnam. Meanwhile, local sources responsible for receiving information from foreigners in Hanoi have learned that Japanese planes bombed Hanoi and Haiphong yesterday. Japanese planes flew over Hanoi and dropped three small bombs, but were driven back by French anti-aircraft fire. Subsequently, Japanese planes flew to Hanoi again, but did not drop bombs. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Official sources announced today that Chinese troops, after two days of bloody fighting with Japanese troops, completely recaptured Fangcheng in southwestern Guangdong on Tuesday. Chinese troops entered the city on Monday evening and drove out the remaining Japanese troops. Chinese military officials stated that the recapture of Fangcheng was a good result for the Chinese troops since the Japanese invasion of Vietnam. As the Japanese advance into Vietnam continues, Chinese troops' attacks on Japanese bases along the Chinese border continue. It was also stated that Japanese troops are currently continuing to withdraw their troops stationed in Guangdong, such as those stationed along the Hong Kong border and in Shenzhen. Japanese troops stationed in Nantou, southwest of Shenzhen, are said to have boarded ships bound for Haiphong. (United Press dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: A Foreign Ministry spokesperson recently responded to reporters' inquiries as to whether France would resist Chinese troops entering Vietnam, stating that this question should be answered by the French. However, it would not be unreasonable to say that the French would not resist, because if Chinese troops entered Vietnam, they would certainly not act as invaders, but as friendly forces assisting Vietnam and France. The spokesperson also stated that the French side has not formally invited Chinese assistance. (United Press dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Hanoi: French authorities have urgently appealed to Tokyo to send a special envoy to Vietnam to stop the continued southward advance of Japanese troops from South China, as French troops are not resisting the advancing Japanese troops. This urgent request from France came after Major General Nishihara of the Japanese delegation failed to curb the southward advance. The advancing Japanese troops had entered Lang Son from Guangxi Province and now appear to be advancing towards Hanoi. Coincidentally, as the French authorities made an urgent request for Tokyo to mediate the local situation, the French government decided to protest to the Japanese government because six Japanese planes flew over Hanoi this morning, believing that the Japanese violated the agreement reached on Sunday after the disarmament of the French troops. The Chinese Consul in Hanoi, Mr. Zeng, has left Hanoi with his staff, and all Chinese banks in the area have also closed their doors. French authorities expressed doubt about reports that Chinese troops had entered Vietnam. Official sources stated that the Vietnamese government will remain in Hanoi, at least for the time being, but it is expected that the Vietnamese government will eventually have to relocate unless Japanese troops from South China cease their advance towards Hanoi. Japanese troops continued to land their troops and equipment in Haiphong today, and according to the Hanoi Agreement, 6,000 troops will be stationed there. Although no date has been set regarding the permission for the Japanese to occupy three airfields, the Japanese will take over these airfields in a short time. (United Press dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>French Protest Bombing of Haiphong; Japanese Officer Expresses Apology</p>
<p>Hanoi officials issued a communiqué last night stating that the situation in the Lang Son area has not changed. Japanese troops landed at the port of Haiphong and proceeded to their garrison locations. The process was quite peaceful and in accordance with the spirit of the Franco-Japanese military agreement of the 22nd. The Japanese general commanding the landing troops apologized to the French authorities for the bombing of Haiphong by Japanese planes yesterday morning, stating that the pilots had not been ordered to do so and acted independently. According to reports, the bombing yesterday morning resulted in the death of 15 residents and the injury of 18 residents. The French authorities deemed it an "inexplicable hostile act" and immediately lodged a strong protest with the Japanese government. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Haiphong: The Vietnamese authorities have lodged a serious protest with Japan regarding the bombing of Haiphong. Yesterday, before the Japanese landed in Haiphong in accordance with the Hanoi Agreement, Japanese planes appeared over Haiphong and dropped several bombs, causing casualties among the Vietnamese residents in the city. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Hanoi: Japanese military authorities formally apologized to French officials in Annam yesterday for the bombing of Haiphong. According to the Hanoi Agreement, 2,000 Japanese troops landed in Haiphong yesterday. Prior to the landing of the troops, Haiphong was bombed. Japanese officials stated that the bombing of Haiphong was a complete mistake, and they deeply regretted the deaths of 15 local people. According to foreign reports from Haiphong last night, the unprovoked bombing of the city by the Japanese was inexplicable. All French troops, except those necessary for defense, had been evacuated in advance. Even when the Japanese planes circled over the city, French anti-aircraft batteries did not fire a single shot until the Japanese air force had dropped four bombs, and then the French were forced to resist. The Japanese bombing of Haiphong yesterday morning fortunately did not cause chaos, but many residents packed their belongings and fled the city. The damage caused by the Japanese bombers was not extensive, only destroying several straw huts of poor residents. After the bombing of Haiphong, two more squadrons of Japanese planes, each containing eight planes, circled over the city. These planes did not drop bombs. Japanese troops began to land at dawn yesterday, actually landing in two locations outside Haiphong, and then walked into the city, arriving at their destination around noon. The landing Japanese troops were carrying heavy loads and looked dejected and exhausted under the scorching sun. Some stragglers rode rickshaws, following behind the troops. It is reported that the number of Japanese troops who arrived in Haiphong "for the purpose of defense" far exceeds the number of French and Annamese guards stationed in various cities in Annam. It is reported that another 4,000 Japanese troops will land before the end of this week. In addition to the dog squadrons and aircraft escorting them in the air, there were also a dozen tanks accompanying the Japanese troops who landed yesterday. (United Press dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Vichy Claims Japan-France Agreement Has Been Suspended</p>
<p>Vichy: Officials of the Petain government declared last night that the Franco-Japanese agreement allowing Japan to obtain bases in Vietnam must be suspended indefinitely due to Japan's invasion of Vietnam. Officials stated that the French government entered into the agreement with the Japanese authorities in good faith and intended to maintain it to the end, but Japan violated the agreement by attacking French troops and invading Vietnam, so the original conditions of the agreement cannot be applied. Before the situation is resolved, Japan cannot obtain bases in Vietnam. The government also stated that the war in Vietnam is still ongoing, contrary to reports from the Japanese side. (International News Service dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>London: The Manchester Guardian commented on the situation in Vietnam, stating that the Vichy government is only making concessions. The question now is whether the Japanese government will be satisfied with the major concessions granted by the formal agreement. The Times stated that Vietnam occupies the most important military position in the Far East, and the fate of the Far East is not something that Britain and the United States can ignore. If Vichy takes a firm stand and refuses Japan's demands, it will certainly not be isolated and helpless. The extent of the current concessions has not been made public, but it is certain that a new and serious threat to the Burma Road has begun. Anyone who knows the tactics of Tokyo does not believe that the reduction of French territory in Asia will be limited to the points mentioned in the Franco-Japanese agreement.

This matter was completed this year with the exchange of documents by the British Ambassador. In peacetime, Weihaiwei is used as a rest and recreation area for British naval personnel in the Far East. Due to the ongoing war in Europe, British naval personnel do not have the same opportunity to use it, but some soldiers are still stationed there to take care of the leasing and renewal of houses on Liugong Island, as stated in the Sino-British Treaty on the Return of Weihaiwei on April 19, 1930.

<p>Washington: Secretary of State Hull recently declared that the fundamental policy of the United States Navy to keep the main fleet stationed in Hawaii has not changed. Hull declined to comment on the embargo on scrap iron, except to say that he believed it was the desire of most Americans. When asked about the US general policy on Japan's territorial expansion program in the Far East, Hull reiterated his statement of foreign policy issued on July 16, 1937, when Japan launched its invasion of China. Hull also said that the United States continues to firmly maintain its previous claims. He said, "If any country undermines them, then they should be held accountable." At the same time, a State Department spokesman said that he had not heard that US Ambassador to Japan Grew had been recalled. He also pointed out that Washington had recently denied this news. (United Press dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Washington: It has been learned here that White House Secretary O'Leary revealed last night that President Roosevelt is constantly discussing the Far Eastern situation with Secretary of State Hull over the phone. President Roosevelt had previously declared an embargo on scrap iron and steel materials to countries outside the Western Hemisphere, but the United Kingdom should be excluded. This embargo will take effect on October 15. When President Roosevelt made the above announcement, he stated that the United States had to issue this embargo order in order to conserve its own supply needs. However, according to the White House Secretary, President Roosevelt is deeply concerned about the Far Eastern crisis caused by the Japanese invasion of Annam and the jurisdictional dispute over the Shanghai Concession. As for whether the future embargo scope will be expanded to include various gasolines, O'Leary said that there is no news at the moment, but outside speculation believes that it is possible. According to the impression gained last night from the most well-informed sources here, the US loan to China and the simultaneous order prohibiting the export of scrap iron do not fully represent the response steps planned by the United States as a result of Japan's destruction of the status quo in Annam and Shanghai. Although it was not explicitly stated when the embargo order was issued that the order was extremely related to the Far Eastern situation, O'Leary's tone clearly indicated that this move was undoubtedly aimed at Japan.

<p>US Bans Steel Shipments to Japan; Congressional Leaders Unanimously Approve</p>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt's order yesterday to ban steel shipments has now received widespread support from Congressional leaders. Congressman Sheehan of the Western and Nier Democratic Parties said that the President's action, "if it has" good reason, is very legitimate. We should not deal with Japan alone, but when we feel that there is a legitimate reason to implement it, we should implement it ourselves. Therefore, I express my approval of the President's move. Congressman Mace, a Republican from Minnesota, believes that this embargo will increase Japan's aggression, and advocates that the United States should immediately adopt further and stronger measures. Mace said that this blockade is accelerating Japan's efforts to seize the Dutch East Indies. If we intend to implement a blockade on any items, we should do it thoroughly, and prohibit the transportation of all goods, including gold, to and from Japan. Senator Capehart, a Republican from Kansas, said this is a "good action, I very much agree and hope that it can be implemented for a long time." Senator Wiley, a Republican from Wisconsin, predicted that this embargo will bring Japan and Germany closer, "but in terms of the path we are following, it is a reasonable step. The overall impact of this action can only be known in the future." Congressman Crawford, a Republican from Michigan, said that in view of Japan's expansion policy, the entire Far Eastern situation depends on whether the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies are in danger. However, he also said that he does not feel that the blockade will increase the danger of the Dutch East Indies and other places. On the question of whether the embargo would increase danger to the other areas in the Far East, which some members of Congress endorsed by supporting the embargo, Crawford said, "The Philippines and the Dutch East Indies are inherently dangerous, but President Roosevelt's actions do not seem to increase that danger, because Japan has already decided to implement its territorial expansion policy, and it will do so no matter where it is. I am heartily convinced of the President's move and have long hoped for it. Our work of helping Japan destroy China has been greater than any other country in the world. I am very pleased that we are taking practical action today in place of empty words." (United Press dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The right-wing newspaper "Kokumin Shimbun" today published an article severely criticizing the US loan to China and the ban on scrap iron shipments to Japan, saying that if Britain and the United States continue to take a groundless anti-Japanese stance, they will be hit hard, and not only in Burma and Singapore. "Tokyo Shimbun" published an article titled "Battle for Supremacy in the Pacific," saying that Vietnam is only a small corner of the great duel that is currently developing between Japan and the United States. Britain is also clearly involved in this matter, in order to recover the losses suffered in Europe. The relatively moderate "Asahi Shimbun" said that the conflict between Japan and the United States now seems unavoidable. We welcome the United States to decide its actions in a firm state, instead of using slow methods to persecute Japan. American hostility towards Japan is increasing, and the pressure applied to Japan is increasing, which is actually a test of the Japanese people's determination to resist. The newspaper admitted that the new overseas Chinese in Hong Kong are all prepared to make all sacrifices to help Japan's national policy. "It reported that Mr. Gunji had returned to Yokohama earlier in the week." (United Press dispatch, 27th)</p>

Those who advocated American neutrality and non-intervention in foreign affairs were stopped by the public. A motion was then passed by a majority, opposing any declaration advocating neutrality, marking a change in the American Legion's policy, which had not changed for sixteen years. The motion declared, "To the British people who are defending the coast and freedom, and to the heroic Republic of China, we extend assurances of friendship and sympathy." The motion also urged the US government to take all legal steps to stop the transport of war materials to aggressor nations, and to continue to provide full cooperation to the peoples of all nations resisting aggression, as is consistent with their safety, freedom, and peaceful responsibilities.

<p>Washington - According to statistics from the Department of Commerce, Japan's purchases of scrap iron and steel from the United States in the first seven months of this year have reached one-third of all U.S. production. The total amount of U.S. exports at that time was just over 1,796,000 tons, of which 525,000 tons were shipped to Japan alone. The United Kingdom also purchased 599,000 tons. In the same period in 1939, U.S. exports totaled 2,123,000 tons, with 1,155,000 tons going to Japan and only 254,000 tons to the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, commercial sources revealed that China has shipped as much as 3,750 tons of tungsten ore to the United States in repayment of debts. This shipment of tungsten ore is more than three times the amount imported last year and approximately twenty-five times more than the amount China shipped to the United States in 1938.

<p>The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the world's five oceans. Its widest point from east to west is nearly 10,000 miles, and its widest point from north to south is 7,000 miles. Its area of 68 million square miles accounts for half of the Earth's entire sea surface. Within it are three British territories: Canada, Australia, and New Zealand; twelve republics including the United States; the 4,072 volcanic islands that constitute Japan; and also China, the Philippine Islands, and the Dutch East Indies. Along the edge of the North Pacific, the Soviet Union and the United States are separated by less than sixty miles. It is a vast warehouse of goods and commerce, a necessary passage for various trades, a stage for all sorts of risky plays in national policy, and also a focal point for unresolved disputes.</p>
<p>The United States' attitude toward the Far East and Pacific issues is governed by three distinct policies. These three policies are: (1) the Open Door Policy proclaimed by John Hay in 1899. The simplest definition of this policy is that all people of all countries who wish to trade with China enjoy equal opportunities. (2) The Washington Treaties of 1921-1922. According to the naval treaty, the major naval powers agreed to maintain a certain naval ratio. The United States also promised in the Four-Power Treaty not to change the status quo of the defense zones and military bases in the western Pacific, while Japan also promised in the Nine-Power Treaty to respect China's territorial integrity. Although this treaty was broken by Japan long ago, the United States still adheres to it. (3) The Stimson Doctrine of non-recognition. This policy was announced after Japan occupied Manchuria in 1931, declaring that the United States would not recognize any situation, treaty, or agreement that violates the terms of the Kellogg-Briand Pact.</p>
<p>Every country has five types of boundaries. First, within the country, is the geographical boundary. Second, equally or exceeding the geographical boundary in scope, according to the country's area and strength, becomes the military boundary, which is the boundary defended by the strength of the army, navy, and air force. Third, is the economic boundary. For example, the economic boundary of the United States certainly includes Brazilian coffee and Bolivian tin. Fourth, is the diplomatic boundary, mostly protecting the country's interests outside the geographical boundary, or responding to any danger that these interests may encounter. Fifth, is the moral boundary, which can be illustrated by phrases like "Open Door."</p>
<p>Generally speaking, a country's diplomatic boundary, at a certain period, can be used to represent that country's "policy," while the military boundary represents that country's "power" to defend that policy. The purpose of this article is to discuss what relationship these two boundaries have to the various interests of the United States in the Pacific.</p>
<p>American interests in the Pacific can be divided into several categories:</p>
<p>(1) Territorial: The United States holds several groups of islands in the Pacific, for example, the Hawaiian Islands, Guam, Midway Island, Wake Island, and part of the Samoan Islands. (The Philippines are not included because, according to the Tydings-McDuffie Act, the Philippines will no longer belong to the United States by 1946.)</p>
<p>(2) National: There are 7,000 American citizens residing in China and 8,000 in Japan. There are also many American residents in the Philippines, and a few in the Dutch East Indies and the Straits Settlements (estimated at 625 in the Dutch East Indies and 525 in the Straits Settlements). Among them, those residing in China are of greatest concern to the U.S. State Department.</p>
<p>(3) Investment: The exact amount of investment is not easy to ascertain. According to reasonable estimates, there are $250 million in China and $350 million in Japan. But the more Japan advances into China, the more the opportunity for American investment in China will be limited. In any case, the total amount of American investment in the Far East is $750 million, only about 6% of the total amount of American foreign investment.</p>
<p>(4) Trade: In 1938, the total amount of U.S. exports to China was $35 million, and the total amount of imports from China was $47 million. The total amount of U.S. exports to Japan, however, was very large, reaching nearly $240 million, and the total amount of imports from Japan (mostly silk and cotton goods) was $126.82 million. The majority of U.S. exports to Japan can be used as war materials, such as machinery, scrap iron, and gasoline. This action by the United States is tantamount to helping Japan attack China. As for the U.S. exports to the Philippines, the total amount reached $86 million, and the total amount of imports was $94 million.</p>
<p>(5) Aviation: Civil aviation not only follows existing trade routes but also opens up new routes, opening new doors for future trade. The Pacific air route operated by Pan American Airlines is very important, both in terms of commercial and national prestige value, and also has an obvious military benefit, because pilots not only receive training in flying over the Pacific Ocean, but also gain valuable information about the climate conditions over the Pacific Ocean. The bases constructed by the airline from America via Honolulu, Midway Island, Wake Island, Guam, to Manila are of extreme military importance.</p>
<p>(6) Cultural: The United States has important interests in the cultural sphere, especially in China, such as Xiangya University, Peking Union Medical College, and countless other schools, churches, and hospitals. If the United States is unwilling to sacrifice these important and valuable interests, it can never abandon its political influence in the Far East.</p>
<p>(7) Political: The whole world is interconnected, especially in the Far East. In order to maintain its national power and prestige, the United States must assume political responsibility.</p>
<p>All of this is what the United States must defend. But in what position does the United States stand to defend it?</p>
<p>To answer this question, we must first discuss who is the United States' hypothetical enemy. In the current state of international politics, with respect to the Far East and the Pacific region, the United States' only hypothetical enemy is Japan. If Germany were to win the war in Europe, the situation would of course completely change. At that time, the U.S. defense must also be completely changed accordingly. But at present, the only thing the United States needs to fear in the Pacific is Japan. This is not to say that Japan intends to declare war on the United States on a certain day of a certain month in the future. Most sober-minded political commentators admit that such a risky move is currently unlikely. However, under the current circumstances, Japan is the only country that can threaten American interests in the Pacific, and the only power that can brew a Pacific war. Therefore, the United States should determine its military and naval policies in the Pacific based on this goal.</p>
<p>If war were to unfortunately break out between Japan and the United States, Japan's first step would be to strike at the unprotected American outposts in China. The U.S. troops stationed in China would be isolated and helpless. Since 1927, the United States has cooperated with other countries to protect the Shanghai International Settlement, where it has stationed 1,100 naval personnel. In North China, there are 5,000 U.S. Marines stationed in Beijing and Tianjin. There are four U.S. warships along the Yangtze River, and one in Guangzhou. The Asiatic Fleet, based in Shanghai or Manila, has only one 10,000-ton cruiser, one 7,000-ton old-fashioned cruiser, twelve outdated destroyers, twelve submarines, and some small auxiliary ships. The United States has not stationed any battleships or aircraft carriers in the Far East. In the past, it even did not station a fleet at the naval base in Hawaii, for fear of offending Japan. But now it is different, the United States has concentrated its entire fleet at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii.</p>

<h3 id="e20">British Planes Fly Over the Channel in Force, Heavily Bombing German Bases, Multiple Fires on French, Belgian, and Dutch Coasts, Power Station in Berlin Area Destroyed <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>London - Large numbers of British planes flew over to the European continent today, carrying out large-scale air raids, inflicting extremely heavy damage on the French, Belgian, and Dutch coasts. Since the British Air Force began attacking bases being prepared for the invasion of England, this has been the most intense. British bomber formations flew across the Channel in succession, like wave after wave. All German invasion bases along the European coast were bombed. British planes descended rapidly through the low-lying rain clouds, dropping large quantities of bombs, turning the Channel's fog into a mass of red light. Along hundreds of miles of the European coast, fires broke out everywhere. (International dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>London - The British Royal Air Force, which has been actively attacking Germany and its occupied territories, again flew in a fan formation to the skies over Europe yesterday, increasing pressure every hour, reaching the largest air raid since the start of the war. The British air raids have greatly ravaged more than twenty important target European cities, including Berlin and the Kiel naval base. The British air raid speed has increased to the fastest. The targets that were bombed previously are still piles of rubble. Public notices state that the Germans have not had time to clear the rubble, and British planes have come to bomb again. According to returning British Air Force personnel, Berlin's two major power stations and the Tempelhof airfield have been reduced to rubble. It is rumored that the German first-class battleship "Schleswig-Holstein" was destroyed by British planes yesterday. The Kiel naval dockyard also suffered a major blow. German invasion ports in the English Channel were subjected to two daytime bombings by British planes. According to officials, ships in German ports suffered severe damage. (International dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>London - Reuters - An air force correspondent said that the air offensive taken by the British Air Force against Germany is becoming more intense. In addition to dealing heavy blows to several invasion bases around the clock, the operational range is now being extended to remote areas of the German mainland. Within the twelve hours from sunset to dawn, British long-range aircraft flew all over the German mainland. This week, British giant aircraft flew within 55 miles of the Polish border to bomb a power station. Because long-range bombers are not protected by fighter escorts when they attack, daytime activities are strictly limited. However, medium-sized bombers have intensified their attacks within shorter distances during the day. Although the activities of British Air Force bombers have doubled, it is still the first step in strengthening the planned offensive. In the future, Churchill's words will be realized, reaching a level of intensity that was previously unimaginable. As British aircraft activity becomes more and more intense, it is expected that the bombing of military targets in Berlin and other major German cities will rapidly intensify. Currently, Berlin is only subjected to one air raid per night, because British planes have to fly 1,200 miles to attack, which is not as easy as German planes flying only 300 miles to attack. Comparing the destructive blows inflicted by the British Air Force on the German war machine with the efforts of the German air force to try to crush British industry and morale, it can be seen that the British Air Force's performance is far better than that of the German air force. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>London - The Ministry of Aviation issued a public announcement last night stating that all British planes that flew to Germany and the Channel last night to carry out attacks returned safely. British bombers flew over the Berlin area, bombing power stations, railway transportation, and the Tempelhof airfield. The Kiel shipyards and warehouses in Hanau-Kesselstadt were also quite successful, and ships and wharf storage depots in ports such as Antwerp and Dunkirk were also attacked. Also, a British coastal plane shot down an enemy bomber yesterday afternoon, which crashed into the sea. Last night, a squadron of British coastal planes bombed and set fire to oil tanks in Brest. Ships in the port were also severely damaged. During the attack on Kiel, a huge bomb dropped by a British plane landed at the north end of the shipyard and the shipyard. It was seen that the point where a bomb exploded was very close to the German cruiser "Scharnhorst," which was docked at the Kiel naval shipyard. The attack on Boulogne lasted three and a half hours, with many fierce explosions and fires breaking out, the flames illuminating the entire city, and visible from 50 miles away. According to reports from returning pilots, British planes dropped bombs with extraordinary accuracy, causing a great deal of damage. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>London - The scope of German aircraft activity in British skies yesterday was very limited. However, the number of German aircraft destroyed by British fighters still reached 31, including 15 bombers. The British also lost 8 fighters, but 3 of the pilots were safe and sound. According to a public announcement from the Air Ministry, the German air force made its first attempt to send a squadron of bombers to invade British skies during the day since its defeat in the attack on Britain on the 15th of this month.

<h3 id="e22">Ministry of Education Recently Announces Savings Method for Elementary School Teachers <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing News Agency) The Ministry of Education recently announced the original text of the savings method for elementary school teachers as follows:</p>
<p>(Article 1) This method is formulated in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of the Regulations on the Treatment of Elementary School Teachers. (Article 2) The savings of elementary school teachers are divided into the following types, which are selected and applied by the education administrative organs of cities and counties according to the educational funds and the salary status of elementary school teachers: (1) Free savings, (2) Compulsory savings, (3) Incentive savings, (4) Retirement savings, (5) Mutual assistance insurance savings. (Article 3) In places where Articles 2, 3, and 4 of the Regulations on the Treatment of Elementary School Teachers are implemented, elementary school teachers should be encouraged to set aside a portion of their salary each month for free savings. (Article 4) In places where seniority-based salary increases are implemented, elementary school teachers should be compelled to deposit one-third or one-quarter of their seniority-based salary increases as savings. (Article 5) In places with sufficient funds, a special budget should be allocated from the city and county education funds to be used as incentive savings for elementary school teachers. When elementary school teachers set aside a portion of their own salary as savings, the county (city) government should give appropriate subsidies and store them together. (Article 6) In places with sufficient funds, a special budget should be allocated from the city and county education funds to be used as retirement savings for elementary school teachers. At ordinary times, the city and county government should add a percentage of the teacher's monthly salary and deposit it on their behalf. At the time of retirement, it will be given in full. (Article 7) City and county education administrative organs should assist elementary school teachers in handling the following two or similar mutual assistance insurance savings: (1) One or two percent of the salary should be taken out each month, and the city and county government should give appropriate subsidies each year, which should be collected and stored as an insurance fund. If a depositor dies, in addition to withdrawing all of his savings, he may also share equally in the total interest earned that year to provide subsidies. (2) Two or three thousandths of the salary should be taken out each month, collected and stored as an insurance fund. If a depositor encounters necessary temporary large expenditures, he may borrow from the fund at a low interest rate to make up for it. In the event of death, a certain percentage may be taken from the fund's interest to provide subsidies. (Article 8) When each place chooses to implement a certain type of savings, it should formulate implementation measures separately and submit them to the superior competent authority for record and implementation. (Article 9) Except for retirement savings, other types of savings should be managed by a committee organized by the competent education administrative organ in conjunction with the participants in the savings. (Article 10) The storage of savings should be handled by the committee in conjunction with national banks or postal savings and remittance bureaus with preferential interest rates, and several methods should be formulated for the depositors to choose from. (Article 11) Elementary school teachers participating in savings may, in the event of the death of a direct relative, or their own serious illness, or unavoidable disasters, etc., apply for interest-free or low-interest loans from public funds to the public, but they must be repaid according to the agreed time. (Article 12) Qualified teachers in national schools, central schools, and civil education departments shall apply the provisions of this method. (Article 13) This method shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>

Under stimulation, they were careful and gradually caught up in points, tying the score at twelve to twelve. The two sides fought fiercely. In the last game, Wu Zhaofeng, a veteran of Zhejiang, launched a desperate counterattack, with accurate smashes. Although Dai Lingxu, a short-range expert from Chu Hui, tried his best to defend, the enemy's position was finally breached. As a result, Zhejiang Xing reversed the defeat with a score of thirteen to twelve, defeating Chu Hui. It was indeed a narrow victory.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Financial Market Turbulent and Unpredictable <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed prices announced, with the British pound at 0.625, calculated at three and a half shillings and 4375, and the U.S. dollar at 1.875, calculated at five yuan and 25 cents. The rest also saw a slight increase. The unofficial market for the British and U.S. currencies initially eased slightly before becoming very tight. This was due to a telegram from Hong Kong indicating that the current shilling was reaching 30 pounds, and HSBC and the Bank of Japan were also involved in buying. Although there was some selling among Chinese banks, the disparity between supply and demand was huge. In the afternoon, there was news of a German-Italian alliance, and the market became even tighter. The British gold rate once fell to three and a half shillings and 484375, and the U.S. dollar retreated to five yuan and 34375. Later, the situation eased slightly as the buying telegrams from Hong Kong stopped. As a result, the British rate tightened by 0.046875, calculated at three and a half shillings, and the U.S. rate softened by 0.03125, calculated at five yuan and 375. The combined exchange rate was three yuan, six jiao, eight fen, five six two five.</p>

By the close, the British gold rate was three and a half shillings, and the U.S. dollar rate was five yuan and 375.</p>
<p>The Market Eases Slightly in the Afternoon</p>

Later, the Hong Kong bank bought spot U.S. dollars from foreign banks at five yuan and 375 and 34375. At that time, spot British gold could only be settled at three and a half shillings and 484375. After 2:20 PM, a telegram from Hong Kong suddenly came, selling spot shillings at three and a half shillings and profitably selling spot U.S. dollars to speculators at five yuan and 375. As a result, the market eased. By the close, the British gold rate was three and a half shillings, and the U.S. dollar rate was five yuan and 375. The ten-month British gold rate was three and a half shillings and 484375, and the U.S. dollar rate was five yuan and 34375.

<h3 id="e34">Foreign Exchange Buying Wind Increases, Gold Prices Rebound <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local market for raw gold saw a sharp rise after an initial decline. The price has returned to outside the 6,100 yuan mark. In the midst of active U.S. economic aid to China and the maintenance of the foreign exchange rate, a telegram from Hong Kong came, pouring in 300,000 pounds of British gold, and Chinese and Japanese banks scrambled to buy U.S. dollars. The foreign exchange rate suddenly tightened, which stimulated people's enthusiasm. The opening price in the morning was 6,060 yuan, which then fell by another 20 yuan. This was because the opening foreign exchange rate was slightly tight. Subsequently, the exchange market suddenly tightened, and gold shops competed to buy. In addition, silver shops followed suit to cover their short positions, and the selling voices on the floor disappeared. Before the close, the price had risen to 6,130 yuan. Later, news of a German-Italian alliance was spread, and the buying momentum became stronger. Silver shops continued to cover their short positions and once reached a high of 6,143 yuan. However, the foreign exchange rate suddenly stopped loosening and turned flat. Buyers decreased at 3:00 PM, and the price fell back by 30 to 40 yuan. But in the end, the buying momentum of the securities firms continued unabated, so the closing price was still 6,120 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous day, the closing price rose by 52 yuan. The total transaction volume was approximately 4,000 taels. Silver jewelry shops increased their listed prices by 10 yuan. Customs gold and other items remained flat.</p>
<p>Raw Gold Rebounds by 52 Yuan</p>
<p>Although the foreign exchange market was loose in the early morning, people's sentiment was still stable, and most were willing to buy at the opening price. Therefore, the opening price only decreased by 8 yuan under the competition of buyers. Gold shops traded 20 taels between themselves at 6,080 yuan. Then, because silver shops increased their short positions, the price continued to fall by 20 yuan, once as low as 6,040 yuan. Suddenly, the exchange market tightened, and a certain silver shop stopped selling and aggressively bought. In addition, the gold shops had a strong appetite for buying, and money changers also dragged in a considerable amount. The price soon rose to 6,110 yuan. Later, a certain money changer came out and sold, and retail investors also followed suit, and the price fell back to 6,090 yuan. After 11:00 AM, the foreign exchange rate continued to tighten, and a certain silver shop came to aggressively cover its short positions. At that time, securities firms and silver shops also absorbed each other. Before the close, the price rose to 6,130 yuan. However, because the silver shops turned from buying to selling, the closing price was 6,115 yuan. The opening price in the afternoon increased by 10 yuan, and securities firms sold 20 taels to gold shops at 6,125 yuan. Later, the price fell to 6,120 yuan. Before long, securities firms came to buy again, and silver shops were also eager to cover their short positions. The price once rose to 6,113 yuan. Later, traders suddenly decreased, and the price fell back immediately. Not long after, a certain silver shop came to short again. For a time, there was a lack of maintenance, and the price fell to 6,105 yuan. After entering the market, the price was pulled up again by securities firms and rose to 6,125 yuan. The closing price was 6,120 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous day, the price rebounded by 52 yuan. The daily fluctuation was 103 yuan. The selling price of gold from cash gold shops was a dozen yuan higher than that of raw gold, and the buying price was 30 yuan lower. The current standard gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there was little trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Prices Also Increased by 10 Yuan</p>
<p>Silver jewelry shops initially did not change the selling price per tael. By noon, the price was increased by 10 yuan. The Datong Bank changed its listed price to 630 yuan. The new banks had the same price as the previous price, and the buying price was reduced by 30 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Show Different Trends <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a slight increase in raw gold prices. The British and U.S. gold pounds also increased by one yuan each. The need for British gold notes decreased sharply, and the market price fell back by 3 jiao. U.S. gold notes initially continued to soften and once fell to 18 yuan and 2.5 jiao. Later, because HSBC had a strong appetite for black market U.S. dollars, people's sentiment increased, and the market price rose step by step, once rising to 18 yuan and 5.3 jiao. The final price was 18 yuan and 4.8 jiao, an increase of 8 fen compared to the previous day. The Hong Kong exchange rate was slightly weak by 1 fen. The supply of Japanese gold notes suddenly became strong, and the market price weakened. The night market price fell to 1 yuan and 4.9 jiao. The supply and demand of Korean notes remained even, and the market price remained flat. The night market price remained at the original price of 1 yuan and 1.8 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Shanghai Banks Continue to Reduce Interest Rates <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The banking community in the city, in view of the excessive floating capital and high deposits in the Shanghai market this month, and the difficult operation of the market, is suffering from an unsustainable burden on deposit interest rates. In order to reduce losses, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank reduced interest rates previously, and now the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank is responding, and has also announced to all depositors that from October 1st of this year, all current account holders of the bank will be calculated at a monthly interest rate of 2%, (Ben).</p>
<h3 id="e37">Food - Foreign Rice Once Stirred Up, and the Rising Trend of Japonica Rice Was Not Killed <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice lingered for several days. It was generally believed that the base was solid and the market was active. The situation soon tightened, and short covering was frequent. Sellers' shouts were raised immediately. However, the underlying price was already expensive, and the source was endless. The Annam issue did not attract the attention of non-industry hoarders. As for the actual sales, there was no smooth appetite for a long time. Therefore, the result was only a pull-up of 5, 6, or 7 jiao. Even the original English-Hua Si package did not have a new large account consultant. More than 100 tons were opened yesterday. Saigon No. 2 was 77 yuan and 7 jiao, 7 jiao higher than the previous day. Siam No. 2 was 77 yuan and a half, also half a yuan higher. The daily spot rice transaction was 7,000 bags. The market price was 70 yuan, Saigon No. 2 was 66 yuan, Siam No. 2 was 64 yuan and 3 jiao, 64 yuan, Xiao Jiao was 64 yuan, and Mi Lu was 56 yuan.</p>
<p>The supply and demand of glutinous rice were similar, and there were no gains or losses. The arrival of thick and thin japonica rice was still interrupted, resulting in a strong trend that has not been killed, and is still rising. The prices continued to increase by one yuan. Kai Chang bang Su Jing was 84 yuan and 5 jiao, and the next one, Su Jing, was 81 yuan and 2 jiao. Thin rice has not been opened. The original Nan Gang package of early rice was 83 yuan and 4 yuan, the market price was 83 yuan and a half, and it was decided to be about 80 yuan.</p>
<p>The arrival of new japonica rice was also reduced, with a total of only 200 to 300 bags. Therefore, it followed the other goods and was raised across the board. Kai Zhuanqiao new japonica rice was 77 yuan, the market price for Taicang Jiading sheep tip was 66 yuan and a half, 66 yuan, and the Qingjiao Du tip was 68 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Flour and Wheat Stable <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Flour was stable yesterday. Hua flour mills remained unchanged, and even the Japanese street remained unchanged. The demand was quite good, and the supply from various factories increased slightly, but the current flour was still in short supply. However, the returning goods were affected by the large transaction of foreign flour. The price of Phoenix brand current flour was similar to the factory price, and it was difficult to transport into the concession. The factory was also not very welcome in this street. The factory flour price still needed 18 yuan and 35 jiao. Due to the arrival of goods from Qingdao and rumors of unified control, the appetite for sales in North China also turned sluggish. Therefore, the market was unusually flat, and the rising trend of the flour market gradually subsided.</p>
<p>The wheat market was flat yesterday. The goods arriving from the mainland were mostly designated to be sent to Japanese factories and priced according to the market price. The goods side always thought about improving the price, but it was difficult to achieve. The transport of Japanese flour to the market has entered a smooth path. The wheat market has also slightly improved. The amount received by Japanese factories was only 1,000 to 2,000 bags. Chinese factories did not absorb it because foreign wheat had arrived. The prices of various goods also had few gains or losses.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Securities - Domestic Bonds Rise Sharply with Small Corrections, Foreign Bonds Show Mixed Trends <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's market conditions for unified public bonds showed a trend of rising sharply and correcting slightly over the past few days. The price was approaching the new high point of September 10th. Although it once rose sharply due to the success of the Sino-U.S. loan, it inevitably caused speculators to sell off at high prices. It was believed that the market price was rising too fast, so most of the floating profits were released. It was inevitable that the market sentiment would turn sluggish and weak due to the selling pressure. However, due to the abundance of floating capital and the reduction of interest rates by banks, it still did not escape the trend of rising more and falling less. The opening price in the morning was initially firm due to the absorption and pull-up of Lianhe Hongda Xinfu No. 16 and No. 7, etc. However, in an instant, Kanglian Yida Tong No. 11 and others poured out aggressively, resulting in a blow. The market price was unable to persist and became a straight line downward. In the afternoon, No. 6, No. 16, and Xinfu continued to pay in, while Lianyi Shuntai Tongkang Hongda sold out. The market conditions were clearer, and the price continued to decline slightly during the rotation. The result was a unanimous reduction of a small half yuan to 7 jiao, with a transaction volume of 1.2 million yuan.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 30 shares of the Bank of China were traded at a price of 68 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, most of the transactions in the public stock market were for covering short positions and settling floating profits. Because the transaction volume this week was unusually large, the forces of both the long and short sides were evenly matched. The outcome of yesterday's decisive battle was difficult to determine which side had the advantage. There were few changes in the news, and the prices of each stock were generally very stable, except for a few that fluctuated due to the competition between the long and short sides.</p>
<p>London, 16th (Thursday) Telegram: Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks showed mixed trends. Chinese railway foreign debt, including the Beining Railway public bond, increased by 3 pounds to a price of 41 pounds. The Daoqing Railway public bond also increased by 1 pound to a price of 10 pounds. The Hukuang Railway non-German bond remained at 12 pounds. In addition, the German bond and the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway public bond each fell by 1 pound. The price of the Hukuang German bond was 10 pounds, and the price of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway was 6 pounds. Among the Far East stocks, the stock of the Mai Jia Li Bank continued to rise by 1 shilling and 3 pence to a price of 6 pounds, 12 shillings, and 6 pence. The bearer stock of the Kaiping Coal Mine fell by 1 shilling to a price of 14 pounds. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Although Yarn Sales Are Weak, Cotton Yarn Still Expected to Be Good, Yesterday's Market Wanted to Fall but Rose Again <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had been up and down a lot the previous day, entered a firm and rising path again yesterday. This was actually because after rising for several consecutive days, a portion of profit-takers came out, causing the surface to loosen slightly, and the market took the opportunity to fall back. However, recently, major players and those with funds have again become optimistic about the rise in yarn prices, so the amount of absorption is not only unwilling to sell, but there are still measures to increase the price when it is low. As a result, the situation is still upright, but sales are not as enthusiastic as on the day.</p>
<p>In the morning, the single of the general "gun cap" opened low, and the main helpers were those who scooped in, so they shouted in unison. However, the sellers were reluctant to sell in view of this situation. The transaction price was 1,068 yuan, and then the buyers flocked in, and most of them wanted to be good, rising to 1,077 yuan, which was the most prosperous transaction. It rose again to 1,082 yuan. At this time, it was heard that current sales were sluggish, and it fell again to 1,075 yuan. The closing price was 1,078 yuan. The statistical statistics of the amount of transactions from various gangkou in the first half of the day are listed as follows:</p>
<p>同行 (Same Trade) 2,720 香港 (Hong Kong) 365 統計 (Statistics) 3,085</p>
<h3 id="e41">It Is Rumored That The Mortgage For American Cotton Will Be Increased <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is firm, because people are mostly optimistic about the future. The reasons for this are nothing more than the difficulty in transporting new cotton. However, the British and Germans are bombing each other fiercely, the European market has stalled, and Indian cotton has to find a way out to the East. If the foreign exchange is lengthened, the price of Indian cotton is still expected to become cheaper. Therefore, the factory's demand is not strong, transactions are not prosperous, and the market price is also rising in a roundabout way.</p>
<p>Another message: The market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market initially rose due to purchases by speculators, and then because of good spot trading, and a part of the government will increase the mortgage for cotton, so the industry's purchases were unusually enthusiastic. As a result, the closing price was 8, 9, and more than 10 pounds higher than the previous day. India, including the top measurement, fell by one rupee.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton trading became quieter again yesterday. This is still because the stock on the market is not abundant, and the industry plans to wait for a good price. Although the factory's intention to purchase is strong, it strongly wants to search for those with low selling prices, so it has not been able to purchase them.</p>

<p>Yesterday's spot crude soybean oil market price jumped another yuan. The market price of actual crude soybean oil is very different, and the soybean oil chips are very short. Although the arrival and storage of peanut oil are both thick, there are Tin Chang Zhen Yang inland rivers and other places that are secretly transporting, so the general bullish fortifications are extremely strong.

<p>Not many Haikou branches (a type of seafood) have arrived recently. The amount of goods in the hands of traders is also limited, so the market trend has tightened. Yesterday, northern and southern goods dealers opened more than a thousand boxes. Top-quality products, like Dongzhi seafood, rose by five to six yuan, with other grades rising by one or two yuan by varying degrees.</p>

Yesterday's market asking prices were: 7-foot sheets required 7 yuan 75 cents; 6-foot sheets also required 6 yuan 75 cents. Both were up by 10.5 cents from the previous prices. It is estimated that a total of 4,000 sheets were traded.</p>
<p>The market for factory nails has flourished since the purchase by the Yantai merchants. In addition, the Tianjin merchants have also recently shown interest in searching for goods, so the market atmosphere is quite good. Standard prices have therefore soared. Yesterday's market price was 55 yuan, with Bessemer steel up by about 2 or 3 yuan from before, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Early Restoration of Public Transportation: Chinese Director Willing to Mediate: British Tram and Labor Opinions Approaching Agreement: Public Bus Yesterday in Negotiation <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>After the workers of the British Tram Company in the International Settlement, the Chinese Public Bus Company, and the French Water and Electricity Company in the French Concession successively went on strike, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent letters to the Public Works Department and various companies, hoping to seek a reasonable solution quickly. It is heard that both labor and management have expressed respect for the Chamber of Commerce's opinions. The labor side has prepared procedures and will request the Public Works Department's Chinese Directors, Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Ludeng, and the Industrial Section to mediate. New Sound News reporters inquired with Yu Qiaqing and the Industrial Section yesterday. As of last night, no formal request from the workers had been received. They expressed their willingness to accept the mediation issue in order to resolve the public utility strike turmoil as soon as possible, so as to maintain public transportation and social order within the Settlement.</p>
<p>British Tram Expected to Resolve</p>
<p>After the workers of the British Tram Company went on strike on the 20th of this month, although two negotiations were held, the issue of increasing wages could not be resolved. Now that both labor and management are willing to negotiate in good faith, it is hoped that the strike turmoil will be resolved satisfactorily. It is heard that regarding the four preconditions put forward by the workers, the company has agreed to increase the allowance by 20 cents and the rice subsidy by 15 cents for the first condition (a total of 10 yuan and 5 cents per month calculated on a 30-day basis), while the workers have conceded to 13 yuan. For the second condition, workers shall not be dismissed without cause, the company has agreed to accept it. For the third condition, wages during the strike period, the company agrees to pay for two days. For the fourth condition, labor and management conditions both agree to temporarily reserve them.</p>
<p>Public Bus Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>After the strike of the British Public Bus in the Public Concession on the 24th, there has been no contact between labor and management for several days. Because of the harmonious relationship between the two sides, there is no sign of expansion of the strike. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, 12 representatives of the labor side went to the company's head office at No. 111 Sassoon House on the Bund, Nanjing Road, to meet with Zhang Delan, the traffic manager representing the company. The labor representatives presented the four preconditions decided at the meeting on the 24th to the company and expressed the labor side's willingness to negotiate in good faith out of desperation, so as to obtain a reasonable solution. Zhang Delan expressed that the company has always been concerned about the stable life of the labor side and sought ways to improve it, so it deeply understands the current strike. However, he has no power to decide on the proposed conditions and promised to convene a board meeting in the evening to discuss them and agreed to listen to the news at 9:00 AM today. The labor representatives then left. The discussions were close to agreement, so it is expected that if the company's reply today is satisfactory, the two sides will be able to start formal negotiations in the afternoon to discuss the method of resuming work first, and transportation may be restored within one or two days.</p>
<p>French Tram Negotiations in Progress</p>
<p>After the workers of the French Water and Electricity Company put forward 16 conditions for improving their treatment, the union has formally dispatched four representatives to the company for negotiations. After the conditions have been translated into French and carefully considered, a reply will be given. It is heard that the workers believe that the 16 conditions put forward are all based on facts and peaceful requests, and the company should give reasonable approval; otherwise, the management should bear full responsibility. As for trams on Routes 2, 7, and 10, they continued to operate and pick up passengers yesterday morning under the protection of armed police. The Lujiawan headquarters and factory, as well as the stations on each route, were still guarded by Chinese and Vietnamese police, providing strict protection. At 11:55 yesterday noon, three trams on Routes 2 and 7 were bombed at the intersection of Avenue Joffre, injuring eight passengers. The detailed process can be found in the section "Disturbances Caused by Bombing of French Concession Trams" on this page.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Disturbance Caused by Bomb Thrown at Tram in French Concession: Eight Passengers, Male and Female, Injured; Three Suspects Arrested on the Spot <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at 10:59 AM, a tram, No. 17 on Route 2 operated by a French company, was traveling eastward and stopped at the Xufui (Avenue Dubail) and Rue du Père Robert intersection. At that moment, Tram No. 4 on Route 7 was approaching from behind. Unexpectedly, several men on the platform suddenly threw paper boxes into the tram. These paper boxes contained sulfur bombs. When thrown into the tram, they exploded with a loud bang, immediately filling the area with thick smoke and intense flames, causing great chaos.</p>
<p>Passengers Flee for Their Lives; Traffic Halts</p>
<p>The passengers inside the tram were greatly alarmed by this sudden incident. The young and strong jumped out of the tram windows to escape, and many fell onto the platform. Women and children were pushed and trampled, their screams shaking the sky. Traffic was completely halted as a result. The traffic police informed the police station and the fire department. The police station dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to maintain order and transported the injured to the hospital for treatment. Soon, the fire department arrived to put out the flames.</p>
<p>Shrapnel Scatters, Eight Injured</p>
<p>At the time of the incident, most of the passengers sustained minor injuries and went to seek treatment on their own. Those with more serious injuries were later identified as: (1) Yan Wu (60 years old, from Suzhou, residing in Xifahua Town); (2) Wang Shiqiao (21 years old, local, residing at No. 65, Tongkang Lane, Mintiniyin Road); (3) Qian Wu (36 years old, from Anhui, residing at No. 1475, Rue Lafayette); (4) Qian Wu's daughter, Qian Qilan (17 years old); (5) Li Shisong (34 years old, local, residing in Baxianqiao); (6) Yang Jinmei (28 years old, local, residing at No. 346, Wenlin Road); (7) Luo Xiangcha (34 years old, from Shangyu, residing at No. 49, Rue Hoche); and (8) Yi Shiping (20 years old, from Shaoxing, residing at No. 1, Lane 690, Route Tenant de la Tour). All eight were injured in the legs by shrapnel. Except for Qian Qilan and Wang Shiqiao, who were seriously injured and hospitalized, the rest were bandaged by doctors and discharged.</p>
<p>Three Arrested for Investigation</p>
<p>After the incident, the police placed the area under guard and arrested three suspects, taking them back to the police station for investigation. Shrapnel and other debris from the tram were also collected for examination. It is reported that the sulfur bombs were homemade, using glass bottles shaped like wine bottles and filled with highly explosive sulfur and other materials, making them very easy to explode. It was also heard that many male and female passengers had their clothes burned. The police station is currently investigating the case.</p>
<p>Announcement by French Police Department</p>
<p>The French Concession Police Department issued a public announcement yesterday stating: "At noon today (the 27th), a passenger on a French tram traveling at the intersection of Avenue Dubail and Rue du Père Robert placed a glass bottle filled with phosphorus inside a third-class carriage. Flames erupted instantly. The incident was spotted by other passengers. A struggle ensued. Fortunately, police intervened, preventing further harm. The passenger was originally a driver for the French Tram Company but was participating in the strike. He confessed at the police station that he obtained the bottle filled with phosphorus this morning in Huxi and intended to use it to burn trams that were in service. At the same time, a similar burning object was found in the tram behind, which firefighters fortunately extinguished, preventing a major disaster. However, eight Chinese were injured. To strengthen security, the French Police Department has increased the number of police officers stationed at all tram stops."</p>
<p>Security Strengthened</p>
<p>Following the burning bomb incident on Rue du Père Robert yesterday, which injured eight passengers, both the Public Works Department and the Police Department of the Municipal Council believe that these unfortunate incidents are occurring daily and have a major impact on passenger safety and security within the concession. Therefore, security was further strengthened on all routes yesterday. More patrolmen were stationed at factories and warehouses to provide protection, and armored cars patrolled the roads incessantly. Security was particularly comprehensive in the Rue du Père Robert area, and protection at tram stops was more stringent than elsewhere. Since the strike, only a few trams have been operating, making them ten times more crowded than before, so negligence is not an option.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Laborers and Night Soil Collectors Also Strike Yesterday <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Public Works Department Laborers</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Public Works Department employs about 1,500 laborers. These workers are usually tasked with road construction and maintenance. However, yesterday around 8:00 AM, as the laborers were working, agitators appeared in the Xiaoshadu Road area and forced them to strike, causing about 600 Public Works Department laborers to stop working. Fortunately, the strike did not spread by the afternoon. It is rumored that the workers have demanded higher wages and other conditions. The Public Works Department has reportedly agreed to increase wages by three cents per person, but the workers felt it was too little, and it is said that the two sides will negotiate again. However, a reporter from the Pingming News Agency inquired with the concession authorities at 4:00 PM yesterday and learned that the striking Public Works Department laborers had not yet made any demands or engaged in any negotiations as of yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Night Soil and Street Cleaners</p>
<p>Furthermore, a small number of garbage truck drivers and night soil collectors in the western district of the Public Concession also went on strike yesterday. Garbage and night soil littered the streets of Binlang Road, Gordon Road, Mackenzie Road, and along the Suzhou Creek, creating a foul odor and causing pedestrians to hesitate. Near the Mackenzie Road cleaning station, dozens of night soil carts were overturned on the road, garbage was scattered everywhere, and several vehicles were damaged. After receiving the report, the police dispatched a large number of patrolmen to the scene to suppress the unrest, but the agitators had already fled. Fire trucks were then called in to wash away the night soil with water. Inquiries with the Public Concession authorities revealed that only a very small number of street cleaners and night soil cart drivers were on strike.</p>
<p>Important News Roundup</p>
<p>Solid Tires Banned The French Concession Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating that from December 1, 1940, new rickshaws not equipped with pneumatic tires will not be allowed to register. This announcement was made by the Chief Administrator, Tan Gute.</p>
<p>Donations for Ningbo Disaster Ningbo has recently been bombed repeatedly, causing great anxiety among Ningbo organizations in Shanghai. In recent days, they have been carrying donations to the Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai to be remitted for disaster relief in Ningbo. Mr. Zhu Boquan, a Ningbo native in Shanghai, raised 20,000 yuan for disaster relief, which is commendable. In addition to remitting the funds to Ningbo for proper distribution, the association will remit more funds for disaster relief as donations from Ningbo natives in Shanghai accumulate.</p>
<p>Leprosy Lecture The China Leprosy Relief Association has invited Pastor Lomick of the Tengxian Leprosy Hospital in Shandong to broadcast a lecture on leprosy problems ("Leprosy in Shandong") on the Gospel Radio Station tonight from 7:00 to 7:30 PM on frequency 760.</p>
<p>Parcel Notice The acceptance and mailing of parcels to Chahe Town, Renhe Town, Licheng Town, Matou Town, Chenjiaji, Shunheji, Gaoliangjian and other places in the Jiangsu area are temporarily suspended.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Authorities Provide Sound Protection: Water and Electricity Supplied Continuously: Workers at French Concession Water Plant All Reside at the Plant; Public Concession Has Made Various Preparations <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Following the strike wave involving public transport vehicles in the two concessions of this city, rumors about the two important public utilities of water and electricity in the two concessions have become rampant, creating an atmosphere of heightened concern. In reality, the water and electricity workers in the two concessions deeply understand the overall situation and are not willing to be used by others. Therefore, they continue to work as usual. According to inquiries made by a reporter from the Pingming News Agency yesterday, both water companies in the two concessions have taken precautionary measures to ensure that the water supply within the concession will not be interrupted. The details obtained are as follows:</p>
<p>Military Protection</p>
<p>The French Concession Water Plant is located at the end of Rue Luber (Luban Road) in Lujiazhen. The plant's water source is drawn from the Huangpu River near Gaochangmiao in the south. However, since the outbreak of the war, the plant has also built several large artesian wells that can also serve as water sources. Due to the widespread rumors, the French authorities dispatched more than 20 armed soldiers to guard the plant's perimeter yesterday morning to provide security. It is also understood that the plant's workers have begun residing at the plant and will not be leaving for the time being. Furthermore, the plant's machinery is powered by diesel engines, requiring only a small number of people to manage.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Preparation</p>
<p>As for the water supply in the Public Concession, it is operated by the Shanghai Waterworks Company. According to representatives of the concession authorities and the company, even if a labor strike occurs in the Public Concession, the concession authorities and the company have reached a common agreement to maintain the water supply and ensure that it will not be interrupted. Therefore, residents within the concession should not easily believe rumors, and even if any outside attempts are made, the water supply will definitely not be interrupted.</p>

<h3 id="e53">Rice Prices Rise Again: Authorities Closely Monitor: Large Amount of Foreign Rice from Hong Kong to be Shipped to Shanghai: Price Assessment Committee Ordered to Continue Performing its Duties <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The rice market situation in Shanghai involves speculation and manipulation, disrupting the market and raising prices. Daily spot prices have continued to increase. Yesterday (27th), the market became even more tense due to the temporary suspension of the Shanghai defense shipping route. Foreign rice prices rose again. However, it is heard that a large amount of foreign rice from Hong Kong will be shipped to Shanghai to provide relief. Rice merchants are currently negotiating purchases and transportation.</p>
<p>Continuing Assessment</p>
<p>The Rice Price Assessment Committee previously believed that it was incapable of handling the chaotic situation in the rice market and requested guidance from the two concession authorities. For more than half a month, the committee seemed unable to proceed with its work and temporarily suspended operations. It is understood that the concession authorities separately replied to the committee yesterday, instructing it to continue performing its duties, assess market rice prices, and promising to provide effective assistance in cracking down on hoarding and price manipulation.</p>
<p>Agreement Reached</p>
<p>According to sources, the two concession authorities considered the matter serious after receiving the committee's request and held several consultations. They also appointed personnel to inquire with rice industry leaders about the actual situation of rice arrivals, sales, and stocks both domestically and internationally. It is said that concrete measures have been agreed upon and will be implemented. The two authorities are paying close attention to the entire rice market in Shanghai. Therefore, they delayed their response to the committee's request until now.</p>
<p>Market Rose Again Yesterday</p>
<p>After the rice merchants' tea party market opened at 7:30 AM yesterday, people's expectations immediately shifted upward, and market prices were generally expected to rise. General speculative rice traders spared no effort in raising prices. Crowds gathered, acting like rats scurrying around. Except for foreign rice, it seemed impossible to buy domestic rice on the market. The initial price of foreign rice was only slightly higher than the previous market. Around noon, retail traders amplified the trend, resulting in new high prices for foreign rice spot prices. No. 1 Saigon rice was priced as high as 70 yuan. However, it should be noted that the above rice prices are for genuine foreign rice, while most of the rice sold on the market is adulterated, so prices will naturally be different. Buyers should pay attention to distinguishing between the two.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Foreign Employee of Public Bus Company, Favacho, Narrowly Escapes Harm: Abducted and Detained in a Small Hut by Armed Men: Released After Intervention by a Machinist: Aisen, Who Disappeared, Released and Returned to Residence Yesterday <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," Bobby Favacho, an employee of the British-owned Public Bus Company and a well-known local sports figure, was abducted on the night of the 25th of this month outside the company's Connaught Road garage by ten armed Chinese men he did not know. After being imprisoned for three and a half hours,</p>
<p>he was released.</p>
<p>Security has now been stepped up at the Connaught Road garage to prevent similar incidents from happening again. Mr. Favacho was on his way home on the night of the 25th when he was taken to a small hut outside the Public Concession by ten armed men and imprisoned for three and a half hours. Fortunately,</p>
<p>a Chinese machinist</p>
<p>from the British-owned Public Bus Company, who was also thought to have participated in the strike, intervened and secured Mr. Favacho's release. Mr. Favacho has been with the British-owned Public Bus Company since its inception twelve years ago and is familiar with most of the Chinese workers. However, he did not recognize any of the ten men who abducted him. It is believed that the armed men intended to kill Mr. Favacho, but he was spared thanks to the machinist's mediation.</p>
<p>Aisen Sent Home</p>
<p>It has been learned that Aisen, the Russian executive of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company who was reported missing, was abducted and imprisoned by armed Chinese for a day and night and was released to his residence on Rue Petain (today's Hengshan Road) at six o'clock yesterday morning. The news was released by the Public Concession Police. High-ranking officials from the police declined to say what was the motivation behind the abduction or to describe the circumstances of it, but a friend of Aisen's claimed that Aisen had visible injuries on his face. The police then stated that the armed Chinese who kidnapped Aisen were not striking workers, but members of a criminal gang or organization. It is generally believed that Aisen was abducted because he refused to join the strike, but this has yet to be confirmed as of yesterday.</p>

<p>The French Consulate General in Shanghai issued Decree No. 372(1) yesterday, stating: "For the sake of following proper procedure, the resolution passed by the board of directors of the French Concession Municipal Council in Shanghai on April 30, 1940, and in accordance with Articles 9 and 15 of the organizational charter of the Shanghai French Concession Municipal Council promulgated by this Consulate General's decree on January 15, 1927, and the tariff table of the French Concession Municipal Council promulgated by this Consulate General's decree No. 590 on December 28, 1939, should increase the tax rates as follows: "This decree includes a miscellaneous tax for the inspection of weights and measures, with tax rates per item as follows: (A) Scales: (1) Beam balance with connecting rod and two small steelyards (excluding weights tax): 3 yuan; (2) Small Roman steelyard (under 125 cm): 20 cents; (3) Medium Roman steelyard (under 15 kg): 30 cents; (4) Large Roman steelyard (under 25 kg): 1.5 yuan; (5) Extra-large Roman steelyard (over 250 kg): 3 yuan; (B) Weighing machines: (1) Tax rate of 5 yuan for those under 100 kg; (2) Additional 10 yuan for weights for those under 500 kg; (3) Additional 20 yuan for weights for those under 2,500 kg; (C) Brass weights: 10 cents; (D) Cast iron weights: 10 cents; (E) Capacity: (1) Gold instruments for measuring dry goods: 50 cents per piece, 2 yuan per set of five; (2) Metal instruments for measuring liquids: 40 cents per piece, 1.4 yuan per set of four; (3) Wood or bamboo instruments: 30 cents per piece, 1 yuan per set of four; (F) Length: (1) Under 1 meter (commercial hard rulers and soft rulers): 10 cents; (2) Over 1 meter (commercial hard rulers and soft rulers): 20 cents; (3) Over 5 meters (commercial hard rulers and soft rulers): 50 cents; (G) Half the tax rate for repairing scales and weights."</p>
<h3 id="e56">Japanese Warship Shells Xiepu Twice <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>A Japanese warship shelled Xiepu, north of Yinhai, again at 5:30 AM yesterday. It fired 58 shells in two rounds. The sound of the shelling was loud and continuous, ceasing only around noon. The Japanese warship remained in the waters for a long time before leaving. After the incident, an investigation into the damage revealed that while the residents along the coast of Xiepu were awakened from their dreams, they were able to escape in time, so there were no casualties. However, many houses along the coast were destroyed, and three civilian boats were sunk. The crew members fell into the water and drowned. After the Japanese warship left, a Japanese warplane was spotted over Shipu at 1:40 PM, observing at sea, seemingly searching for shipping routes. It then flew to Qiancang in Xiangshan Port and subsequently circled and scouted Chuanshan before heading out to sea.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Suspension of Shanghai-Vietnam Route is Temporary: Cautious Steps Taken to Avoid Accidents: French Ships Sailing to Hong Kong Still Enter and Exit Normally <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Due to the sudden change in the situation in Vietnam and the refusal of the French Vietnamese authorities to allow ships from the Allied nations, including Great Britain, to enter its ports, the British naval authorities in China have ordered British merchant ships to</p>
<p>temporarily suspend sailing to Vietnam</p>
<p>in order to avoid accidents, pending clarification of the situation. British ships that were already en route to Haiphong have been recalled. According to reliable sources in the shipping industry, this move is a cautious step to observe the subsequent developments in Vietnam before</p>
<p>deciding whether to resume sailing.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong-Vietnam and Shanghai-Vietnam routes are temporarily suspended to protect interests, but this is only a short-term measure, similar to the previous situation. According to inquiries made by a Xinhua News Agency reporter with the person in charge of the British shipping company,</p>
<p>interests of both countries</p>
<p>the French ships sailing to and from Hong Kong waters are still entering and exiting normally, unhindered. The suspension of service is not related to the relationship between Britain and France. The authorities took this measure solely to ensure the safety of navigation and avoid unfortunate losses. The company is currently monitoring the evolution of the situation in Shanghai and Vietnam and awaiting instructions from its headquarters in Hong Kong before making further arrangements. For now, all ships bound for Haiphong are being diverted to Hong Kong as their final destination.</p>
<p>Postal Service Rerouted</p>
<p>Following the sudden change in the situation in Vietnam, the Shanghai-Vietnam shipping route has been temporarily suspended, and ships from Shanghai are only sailing as far as Hong Kong. This has created difficulties for postal services to the southwest provinces and cities. It is understood that (1) Imperial Airways of Great Britain suspended flights between Hong Kong and Vietnam on the 20th of this month. However, at that time, the airline was still accepting airmail to Hanoi, Bangkok, and other places. As the situation in Vietnam has become increasingly tense, it is now impossible to send airmail from Shanghai to the above two places, and acceptance of airmail has been temporarily suspended. (2) According to regulations, ordinary letters, express letters, registered mail, and other lightweight mail from Shanghai to the southwest provinces and cities are forwarded via Haiphong and Hong Kong. However, since the suspension of the Shanghai-Vietnam shipping route, it seems that all mail to the southwest provinces and cities can no longer be forwarded through the above two locations. According to news from the Transportation Division of the Shanghai Postal Administration yesterday, this mail is being rerouted via Xiamen in Fuzhou and Shipu in eastern Zhejiang, so there is no risk of interruption.</p>

<p>The German ship "Hai Yi," which sails between Shanghai and Xiushan, was detained by a Japanese warship on its return voyage from Shanghai to Xiushan last week, and the ship was inspected. The ship's whereabouts were unknown for a time. It has now been learned that the ship was released on the 23rd of this month and returned to Shanghai on the 24th. During the days it was detained, the ship's food and fuel were nearly exhausted. After the German shipowner telegraphed the company authorities to repeatedly negotiate with the Japanese side, it was finally released. After arriving outside Wusong Port, it could not sail in due to lack of fuel and anchored outside the port. Later, passengers were transported to port by barges from the Huangpu River. Goods have been unloaded ashore over the past two days. The ship is currently moored at the Dongjiadu pontoon.</p>

<p>Wu Gaoyou, a 52-year-old Suzhou native residing at No. 59 Baokang Lane, Lane 315, Rue Dufour (Xiafei Road), was a second landlord who earned a small fortune from the paper business. He was addicted to smoking opium and lived upstairs, renting out the remaining rooms. His son, Wu Guoliang, 25, was in the medicinal herb business. The father and son lived together. At 10 PM on the night of August 15 of this year, Wu's family and neighbors were enjoying the cool air outside the gate and on the sun deck because of the hot weather. Wu was alone in his room,</p>
<p>lying on a couch, inhaling clouds and exhaling smoke. Suddenly, a murderer broke in through the back door and went upstairs, took out a kitchen knife, and hacked Wu's head and face dozens of times, severing two-thirds of his neck, killing him instantly. The murderer fled immediately. By the time the family discovered what had happened, the criminal had already escaped. They reported it to the French police, who sent a hearse to the verification office. The Second Special Court sent personnel to verify the cause of death. The son, Wu Guoliang, signed a guarantee to receive the body for burial. After the case occurred, the police ordered detectives to arrest the murderer. At the time, it was generally speculated that it was a revenge killing, but Wu had no enemies in his lifetime, so it was difficult to determine</p>
<p>the truth behind the murder. It is now learned that this case is the second case of patricide after the Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinzhang brothers' patricide case on Route Haig (today's Huashan Road). The French police have determined that the murder was masterminded by the deceased's son, Wu Guoliang, in collusion with his cousin (the deceased's nephew), who paid 600 yuan to hire a murderer to kill his father. Detectives were dispatched to arrest the mastermind, Wu Guoliang, and two accomplices surnamed Pan. However, the main murderer, a certain Jia, had already fled inland after hearing the news and is currently being pursued. Yesterday afternoon, the police sent the arrested Wu and Pan to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. Prosecutors Sun and Peng questioned them. Police lawyer Gu Shouxi stated that the defendants were involved in a</p>
<p>filial son kills father</p>
<p>case, and because the police station still needed to investigate and track down the fugitive, he requested that the defendants be detained temporarily until the facts of the case were clarified and a request for interrogation was made. The court approved the request after briefly questioning the defendants and ordered a two-week adjournment for further investigation. The defendants were remanded in custody. It is also rumored that the case stemmed from a monetary dispute.</p>

<p>Xie Shao, a 28-year-old woman from Ningbo residing at No. 30 Yuyang Lane, Rue Baille, French Concession, married Xie Qingtang, son of Xie Qirui (59 years old, also from Ningbo, residing at No. 35 Yuyang Lane on the same street), a former jewelry broker, in September of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932). They have had two children each, son and daughter. Recently, her husband, Qingtang, suffered from mental illness and often beat her. Unexpectedly, her father-in-law even</p>
<p>helped a tyrant to do evil</p>
<p>and assisted his son in abusing her. On the 8th of this month, Xie Qirui once again had a dispute with the wet nurse, and Xie again took his anger out on her, beating her throat, causing injuries to her chest and legs. Xie Shao, unwilling to accept this, hired lawyer Qian Xingzhong to represent her and submitted a petition to the Prosecutor's Office of the Second Special Court requesting a medical examination and a statement to the Criminal Division accusing her father-in-law, Xie Qirui, of assault and requesting that he be investigated in accordance with Article 277 of the Criminal Law. The court accepted the statement, and Judge Zhu Chuzhe opened the trial yesterday morning. The plaintiff and her lawyer were present in court,</p>
<p>recounted the past circumstances.</p>
<p>The defendant and his defense lawyer, Wang Zhonghuan, were present in court and denied the assault, stating that the plaintiff had provoked him and torn his clothes. The court verified the statements and advised the defendant, "Your son has a mental illness. As the wife of a husband with an illness, she is naturally affected by the stimulus. As the head of the family, you should take care and not allow family disputes to occur again. You should quickly seek a reconciliation." The case was adjourned to October 2 for further hearing.</p>

<p>According to a report released by the Xujiahui Observatory yesterday morning, the hurricane season for this year has ended as of this week. This is because the current climate no longer has the potential to trigger hurricanes. However, the weather in Shanghai and north of the Yangtze River is very cool and slightly rainy, which is not a sign of hurricanes but rather a result of a cold wave. The weather is expected to clear up in one or two days.</p>

<p>Lu Chen, who ran a brothel in room 222 of the Ji Sheng Inn at No. 195, Fujian Road, had an eight-year-old girl under her care, Lu Yuxian, who died of illness on the 8th. Instead of buying a coffin and preparing the body, Lu Chen colluded with Shi Wenxue, a tea server at the inn, and Lu Miaosheng, a gatekeeper, to abandon the corpse. The police station discovered the incident afterward and arrested Shi, Lu Chen, and inn employees Gu Hongsheng, Yan Gengquan, Gu Youjin, Song Wenxiang, Xu Pinjun, and prostitutes Lu Zhaodi and Wang Xiaofeng. They also arrested Tong Shichang, the owner of Changming Electrical Appliances in Fuzhou Road, suspected of taking advantage of the situation to commit fraud. All were handed over to the Special First Court and detained for a later hearing. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xie Fen continued the trial at the criminal court. The police lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, prosecuted Shi Wenxue, Lu Miaosheng, and Lu Chen for abandoning a corpse. The remaining defendants were not prosecuted due to insufficient evidence to prove their guilt. After the trial, Shi Wenxue and Lu Chen were each sentenced to six months in prison, Lu Miaosheng was found not guilty, and the remaining defendants were released.</p>

<p>Yuan Qishan, a native of Henan, was approximately 50 years old, in good health, and stout. He previously worked as a house caretaker at the Sanbei Company. After the war, the company ceased operations, and Yuan left his job and lived alone in the stove room of Ni Zhenhua's house at No. 195, Wenlin Road. He left early and returned late, without any family. On the 26th, the servants of the Ni family, not having seen Yuan for two days, knocked on his door at 11 PM on the 20th. When there was no response, Ni's maid, Ji Xiuzhen, looked through the glass window into Yuan's room and saw him lying motionless on the bed. They managed to open the door and enter, only to find that Yuan had already died. They immediately reported to the French Concession police, who sent detectives to investigate. The cause of death was determined to be a stroke. Since he had no family, the body was sent to the Tongren Funyuan branch morgue. Yesterday, a report was submitted to the Special Second Court for officials to inspect and confirm the identity of the body, and the Shantang charity was requested to prepare the body for burial, awaiting claim by relatives. It was also reported that the deceased's belongings were inspected by the police and temporarily entrusted to the second landlord for safekeeping, pending delivery to the court for claim by relatives.</p>

<p>Qian Daidong, a native of Jiangbei who worked as an oiler at the Xinyu Cotton Mill at No. 8, Robison Road, had a violent temper. At around 2 AM the previous morning, he had a quarrel and fight with his fellow townsman, Zhang Jinsheng, over a trivial matter in the spinning room. Zhang was seriously injured in a vital area and fell to the ground, crying for help. He was then taken to Baolong Hospital for treatment, where his condition was critical. Wang Conghao, the Chinese detective in charge from the Putuo Road police station, rushed to the scene and arrested Qian. Yesterday, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, described the circumstances and stated that the victim had reportedly died in the hospital, requesting a postponement. When questioned, Qian's statements were evasive. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered him to be remanded in custody for further investigation.</p>

Yuan was in his room at the time and was arrested and taken to the hotel lobby. While searching his room, Yuan unexpectedly managed to unlock his handcuffs while the police officers were not paying attention and escaped without a trace. When the Japanese plainclothes officers went outside, they discovered that Yuan had fled and arrested a tea server in the lobby on suspicion of being a lookout. They then attempted to arrest the head clerk, but he had also fled. It is reported that Yuan specialized in forging passes and was arrested by the Japanese after being discovered. It is also learned that at around 9 AM yesterday morning, Japanese personnel in vehicle No. 297, accompanied by French Concession police officers, went to room 22 of the Southeast Hotel on East Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession. However, the person to be arrested had learned of the news in advance and escaped, so they were not apprehended.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Special First Court. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, filed charges according to law. However, Jiang Deyu stated in court that he did not wish to pursue the matter, so Judge Liu ruled that the case would not be accepted.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Singapore's忧悒 (Melancholy) <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Tao</p>
<p>The steel statue of Stamford Raffles, the builder of Singapore, stands at the southernmost tip of Asia in the center of the dusk. In the past, a layer of brilliant glory shone on his silhouette, but today, in the same silhouette, we can only find an expression worried about the war in the motherland.</p>
<p>When the street lights were already shining brightly on the dim streets, under the coconut trees in the park facing the coast, listening to the breeze brought by the waves, the Malay driver leaned against the carriage and played his beloved accordion, and the sorrowful song followed:</p>
<p>"The glorious sun</p>
<p>The boundless blue coast</p>
<p>The coconut trees are so refreshing</p>
<p>Swaying in the air</p>
<p>Everything is so happy</p>
<p>But</p>
<p>The Malay carriage shop has not a trace of hope"</p>
<p>That weak melody evoked the tears of the passing Malays and the old dreams of the Malays in the past.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European War last autumn, the peaceful scenery of Singapore has gradually changed its appearance. Look, there are more soldiers patrolling the streets, and every part of the island is about to be militarized. On the banks of the Singapore River, young volunteer soldiers carry rifles and are busy training. Most of the shops on Raffles Square, the commercial center, have been forcibly evacuated under the name of coastal defense.</p>
<p>On the other hand, strict blackouts and air raid drills are also implemented from time to time, but because Singapore's residents are racially complex, the municipal authorities have encountered difficulties with language mixing. Since ancient times, Singapore has always been an exhibition place for races. Walking on the streets or squares, you can see Indians with black beards and headscarves, Siamese people who have the habit of applying cow dung to their foreheads, overseas Chinese who dominate the Nanyang area, Malays, Filipinos... Twenty-six countries' languages ​​are commonly used here.</p>
<p>In the event that Singapore is visited by the god of war, the municipal authorities must distribute gas masks, so it must be publicized in the national languages ​​of 26 countries. But the difficulty is that the blackout in Malay means the opposite of deregulation in Arabic. Phenomena like this are too numerous to mention. Therefore, the municipal authorities are now starting to train various ethnic groups in standard Malay; recently, the propaganda has been too effective, and the foolish Indians and others have also felt the threat of airplanes, and on the dark night of the air raid drill, they lit a fire and knelt in front of the god Allah to pray.</p>
<p>Singapore is so permeated with the fog of war that the Seletar Fortress cannot be ignored. In the past, Seletar was just a fishing village in the Johor Strait, but today, it has become a British air force base. Not far from Seletar, there is also a famous naval base, where olive trees and coconut trees crisscross. The tropical vines hang luxuriantly on these branches, disguising this military fortress as an ancient jungle. The surroundings are covered with electrified barbed wire, and Indian police or Malay soldiers guard every place. Several 15-inch caliber cannons are laid on the hills, and gasoline is buried in the dense forest, said to be 3 million tons. If so, it is enough for the British fleet to concentrate in Singapore for a year.</p>
<p>Rear Admiral Demans, a British naval expert in the Far East, once said: "When the East loses Singapore, it will be when the sun sets in Britain." The current situation is really urgent every moment. Britain has recorded 600 million pounds of fortress construction costs in Singapore, building huge docks and installing long-range cannons... She should not easily let this Far East base go!</p>
<p>Here, Singapore has re-entered a paradise mixed with all kinds of races, and is gradually suffering from her憂悒 (melancholy) again.</p>

<h3 id="e76">Review of Drugs <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— Su Fu</p>
<p>Reading Magazine Digest</p>
<p>In the January 1939 issue, I saw that three small countries in Europe uniformly prohibited the publication of advertisements for drugs, and seeing the recent Shanghai newspaper red with advertisements for medicines and tonics, I couldn't help but feel deeply. I feel that the Chinese people do not pay enough attention to health, and sometimes even treat life as a child's play. This kind of wrong psychology must be corrected as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The methods adopted by the governments of these three small countries are as follows:</p>
<p>Denmark: Since 1932, the law has stipulated a strict ban on the publication of various drug advertisements in newspapers and magazines. However, drug advertisements are allowed to be published in publications published by physicians, surgeons, dentists, chemists, etc. (because the government believes that physicians and others have specialized knowledge, and advertisements published after being recognized by physicians and others will not harm the people.)</p>
<p>Norway: Since 1930, there have been laws clearly stipulating that it is strictly forbidden to advertise medicines and tonics at will, and medicines may not be sold unless they have been tested by the National Medical Association (Medieal Board) and the Ministry of Health (Ministry of Health). Therefore, all newspapers and magazines refuse to publish drug advertisements unless the drug has been tested and approved for distribution by the National Medical Association, and the advertisement has also been approved by the National Medical Association.</p>
<p>In Norway, after the medicine is made, it must be submitted to the National Medical Association for testing. If it is approved, it can be sold, and the price must also be reviewed by the association. If the association considers it too high, it can also reduce it. If the drug merchant is preparing to publish an advertisement, he must submit the draft of the advertisement together with a request for review by the association. If the association believes that the words in the advertisement are exaggerated, it can cut and change the wording.</p>
<p>Sweden: The law has clear provisions that medicines containing toxic substances may not be sold unless the prescription is written by a physician.</p>
<p>The sale of all drugs must be inspected and approved by the Ministry of Health.</p>
<p>From the above, the governments of these three countries pay great attention to the manufacture and sale of drugs, and the inspection and review are very careful, because this is a matter of the health of the people of the country. The Danish government also respects physicians very much. As long as the medicine is recognized by the physician, it can be advertised in the publications published by the physician. This is their respect for the physician's personality.</p>
<p>China has not yet seen many medical publications, so it may not be possible to ban drug advertisements in ordinary publications for a while. However, for the sake of national health, it seems that the government and local authorities should strictly review the drugs sold in the market.</p>

<p>Chapter 8: Two People Caught</p>
<p>Hawthorne continued: "Mr. Zhao, can you be frank and explain what you have been through automatically? Or do you have to go to another location before you are willing to speak?"</p>
<p>Yue Boxiong still did not speak, but shifted his cold gaze to me.</p>
<p>Hawthorne removed his false beard and dark glasses, put them in his pocket, and said, "I think you always know me. My surname is Huo, and my single name is Sangzi. This is Mr. Bao Lang, you must have heard of it. Let's meet each other with our real faces. Okay?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne raised his right hand, as if to remove the false beard on his lips. Zhao Boxiong suddenly raised his right hand automatically, first removed his glasses, and then lifted it on his lips, and the false beard immediately fell into his hand. He suddenly spoke automatically.</p>
<p>He made a cold, hoarse sound and said, "Are you private detectives? Isn't it?" Hawthorne bowed slightly, with a smile on his face, but did not answer, his eyes were looking at Zhao Boxiong's leather shoes.</p>
<p>He said again: "What reason do you have to control me with weapons? Infringe on my freedom?" He threw his glasses and other things on the table next to him.</p>
<p>Hawthorne still said with a smile: "I have already said it, it's because of those two bullets. One bullet you killed Wang Li..."</p>
<p>Before Zhao Boxiong could finish speaking, he suddenly let out a sneer, which was a hum from his nose. This smile and hum contained a cold taste. It seemed to have more power than an answer. It even made Hawthorne stunned.</p>
<p>Hawthorne said in surprise: "What, did I say something wrong?"</p>
<p>Zhao Boxiong showed a contemptuous look. He said to himself: "What a great detective with a unique eye..."</p>
<p>Just at this time, the door suddenly opened, and Ni Jin burst in. He was also holding a gun in his hand, and two burly detectives followed behind. I felt that my mission could come to an end, so I took back my gun.</p>
<p>Hawthorne nodded and said, "Detective Ni, I haven't had breakfast yet, and my five internal organs are about to riot. I'll leave this person to you... Bao Lang, although you have had porridge, your nerves have been tense for a long time, so you have to rest. Let's go."</p>
<p>He and I walked to the door, and he stopped again to speak to Ni Jinshou.</p>
<p>"Detective Ni, the pistol on the table is missing two bullets, so keep it safe." He was about to walk out again. Suddenly he stopped again. "He may have a second gun on him, so you have to be careful." After he finished speaking, he was the first to walk out the door.</p>
<p>When I went out with him, I also looked back. Ni Jinshou was still aiming the gun at Zhao Boxiong, and two detectives had already stood on Zhao Boxiong's left and right sides, one was starting to search, and the other had already taken out a shiny copper touch and was about to put it on Zhao Boxiong's wrist. Zhao Boxiong did not have any tendency to resist. (120)</p>

<p>Struggle is not a "noun" in the mouths of empty talkers, but those who work hard do not have meaningless fantasies, and he never makes beautiful dreams; but takes all his time and energy to deal with the difficult reality.</p>
<p>The more setbacks, the more courageous the struggle, but the closer to the road to success.</p>
<p>Struggle requires capital: a calm mind, a healthy body, a firm will, and a fiery passion.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Music and Healing <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>What is the relationship between music and healing? Readers will inevitably have this question after seeing the topic. Indeed, in the past, no matter who in the medical field, everyone unanimously admitted that music can only be used as a thing to cultivate sentiment and adjust the spirit. However, today, some people have discovered that music itself has the function of healing, and they have also cited several existing facts to prove it.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, USA, there was a woman who suffered from paralysis and could not move her feet, but after listening to four radio music programs, she was able to restore her original function. There was also a soldier who participated in the First World War and became a mute because he was shocked by the explosion of shells on the front line; later, after listening to someone singing a famous Italian song, he was able to sing inadvertently. A sanatorium for lung diseases also reported by a doctor that the pulse and temperature of the patients in the hospital often show improvement after they have listened to noble music. The person who cited these things is a senior in the American music industry—Mrs. Harriet Seymour (Mrs. Harriet Seymour), who is also the first person to discover that music can directly heal diseases. She organized a committee in New York called the Charity Relief Music Healing Committee. Last year, initiated by the association, 975 music performances were held in 37 hospitals, and as a result, 44,006 patients were affected differently.</p>
<p>Once, Mrs. Seymour said to the press: "According to my many years of experience, I know that certain diseases can indeed be treated with certain music. Stephen Foster's music and Hungarian and Spanish dance music can treat mental illness or nervous disorders. Sousa's marches and folk songs from various countries can treat paralysis. The ensemble of brass bands, if not too tense, can give comfort to those suffering from heart disease. Classical music has the effect of helping to eliminate the pain of patients. Others such as Mendelssohn's "Spring Song" can make people with insomnia fall asleep sweetly after playing it several times in a row; waltzes are very beneficial for those suffering from tuberculosis."</p>
<p>The connection between music and healing should be good news for patients; and on the other hand, it really shines a new light on the music world!</p>

<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>On the Saying That an Actor's Name Determines Their Fate (1)</p>
<p>Three years ago, I traveled to Japan and saw in its major cities practitioners of nameology predicting people's fortunes based on their names. Inquirers would write their names, and the practitioner would predict their fate based on it. Our country originally had methods of fortune-telling by dissecting and piecing together characters, and their technique is roughly similar. However, these practitioners dissect the characters, discussing the four tones and whether they are yin or yang. It is a pity that at the time, the language barrier prevented me from paying attention. Having researched opera for a long time, I have labored over the study of phonetics, and I unintentionally discovered a strange thing, namely that the sound of an actor's name is related to their fate. Looking at the past and examining the present, it has been consistently accurate. I will now briefly describe the general idea to provide amusement for enthusiasts. Believe it or not, it is up to you.</p>
<p>The tones of Chinese characters, especially the yin and yang of the level tone, are incredibly profound. Not only in lyrics, poetry, opera texts, and ballads is the harmony of hard and soft sounds entirely dependent on the arrangement of the yin and yang of the level tone, but even in an actor's name, observing the quantity of the level tone and the combination of yin and yang can determine their entire life's success, failure, honor, and disgrace. Is this not mysterious? According to my research, for actors with good fortune, among the three characters of their stage name: it is good to have many level tones; it is even better to have many yang level tones; it is good for the surname to occupy a yang level tone; it is even better for the last character to occupy a yang level tone. Based on these four points, here are some examples:</p>
<p>For old male roles, Cheng Changgeng has three level tones, two of which are yang. His reputation and career have been brilliantly recorded for thousands of years. Among his most famous disciples, Wang Guifen and Sun Juxian each occupy two level tones, all yin, with the middle character being oblique. Their artistry was unparalleled, but their fates were unfortunate. Wang died early, and Sun suffered in his old age. Looking back at Lao Tan, Tan Xinpei's three characters uniquely occupy three level tones, categorized as two yang and one yin, with yang at both ends, great talent was achieved, and he enjoyed his later years alone. People admired him as Mount Tai and the Big Dipper. Although his fifth son, Xiao Pei, is considered to have a slender build, his grandson Sun Ziying today almost dominates the male role. His great-grandson Sui will also be a talented person in the future. Is this not because of the good name? When he was around forty years old, his stage name was Xiao Jiaotian (the three characters of Xiao Jiaotian only have one level tone, which is yin), and his voice was unremarkable, wandering in amateur troupes. When he changed his name to Tan Xinpei (the name change occurred in the sixteenth year of the Guangxu reign when he entered the Qing palace as a court actor), he soared straight up, surpassing Wang and Sun, who had long been famous, and finally achieved royal status (in the second year of the Republic, he was given the title of King of the Acting World). Can it not be said that the change of name was helpful?</p>
