<h3>應付遠東新環境　英政府決定積極援華　邱吉爾向郭大使提出保證　緬甸公路准如期重行開放</h3>
<p>倫敦　中國駐英大使郭泰祺昨晚曾應首相邱吉爾之邀前往訪晤、聞對於緬甸公路問題曾作充分之檢討、衆料關於英方決定之文吿不久卽可發表、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　自昨日英政府重行整頓後、邱吉爾首相初决政治姿態之表現、厥為接見中國大使郭泰祺、外間咸信邱吉爾氏曾對該大使透露、英國準備於十月十八日以後開放滇緬公路、又中國大使曾以「英國是吾亦將給予中國擴大的經濟援助」相詢、並批評美國最近貸款與中國之舉、乃為該國外交政策之表現、而英國或亦將起而效允、不讓美國專美於前、此間政府權威方面咸信、前首相張伯倫對德義兩國採取綏靖政策已吿失敗、若再事安撫日本、其失敗之程度、當亦不亞於對德義之結果也、此間政府方面徵諸日本派兵進駐安南、並佔據該處之海空軍根據地、與羅馬柏林軸心國家成立同盟種種事實、均認為必需另行採取新的政策、以應付新的環境云、（四日合衆電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　美國務卿赫爾昨日鄭重宣稱、美國反對滇緬公路之封鎖、因該路乃一重要之國際貿易綫也、關於所傳英國準備於本月十七日英日協定滿期時重開滇緬公路一層、有人請求赫爾對此加以以評論、赫爾乃有上述之宣吿云、（四日合衆電）</p>
<p>重慶據負責方面消息、十月十七日英方之重行開放緬甸公路、目前實際上已可保證、華方各交通當局現正加緊準備、以應付一旦公路開放時之運輸問題、當局方面所認為須應付之重大問題、將為日機難免每日由其越南新根據地出發轟炸及以機槍掃射該路、但據指稱、日方此項空襲並不足以嚴重阻礙該公路之交通、因沿經過鎭南關越南公路之中國往來車輛、雖在日方猛烈空襲之下、仍繼續行駛未嘗中斷、况緬甸公路又與滇越鐵路情形不同、非轟炸所能予以重創、按緬甸公路自落成以來、迄未廣加使用、華方因路綫較短及節省汽油之故、所有運輸多取道滇越鐵路及公路、　自日軍佔領越南、目前華方必須利用緬句公路、為輸入與輸出之一主耍路綫、中國交通當局現正忙於動員及組織大隊卡車及牲畜、以應付十月十七日該公路重行開放後之擁擠貨運、（四日路透社電）</p>
<p>維護在遠東利益　美蘇間進行談話</p>
<p>華盛頓　美國對蘇聯關於德義日三國公的反響之態度、已引起此間人士特殊廣泛之注意、因蘇聯在遠東方面與日本為世仇、目前其利益適與美國相符合也、美駐蘇大使史坦哈特已與蘇外長莫洛托夫進行討論、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>增強防禦應付危機　香港已有充分準備</p>
<p>香港　今日此間對英國飛機出產部大臣皮佛勃洛克所發一電、咸極重視、皮氏電云、「在華英人所已盡其力者、英國人民俱應有以酬之」、關於此電、當地各界以為正與邱吉爾首相於昨日內閣改組後、接見中國大使郭泰祺時所取態度完全一致、蓋自最近所獲倫敦消息以觀、此種情形實足表示英國此時已無繼續對日維持綏靖政策之意向也、目下港地業已增加準備、防空隧道亦已遍境建築、而撤退人口委員會對於請求免除離境者、頗多批示不准、據當局穴稱、「增加撤退船隻前往澳大利亞之可能、此刻正予考慮」、（四日合衆電）</p>
<p>蘇聯聲明不願與日　劃分在華勢力範圍</p>
<p>莫斯科「蘇聯絕未宜布願與日本以劃分在華勢力範圍為條件、而締結互不侵犯條的、」此項剴切聲明、係莫斯科方面答復路透社記者而發者、並稱蘇聯抱有睦鄰政策、茍日本抱有善意、叫蘇聯非無對日接近之可能、此點已由蘇聯外委長莫洛托夫於八月　予以說明云、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>日本以參戰向恫嚇　仍圖調整對美關係</p>
<p>東京半官消息稱、日首相近衛頃宣布、日本已準備調整對美對蘇之關係（四日合衆電）</p>
<p>東京　日外務省發言人須磨頃謂德義日同盟目的在建設歐亞新秩序、並非促成隊戰之勝利、須應並指陳美國有助英參戰之危險、若同盟國以外之第三國參戰助英、則西太平洋之日海軍將助軸心國作戰云、（四日合衆電）</p>
<p>東京　日本一部份報紙今日暗示、若英美兩國不因三强同盟公然反對日本、則日本與該兩國之關係、尙有維繫其繼續友好之望、而「國民新聞」所表態度則又反是、乃以警告姿態、謂日本實有參加歐戰之可能、英美兩國對日本採取之首要壓迫、厥為重行開放滇緬公路、該報云、「美國顯為此種惡劇幕後作祟者、英國所以採取此一反日的表演、乃因其歐洲之失勢也、」「國民新聞」繼稱、「日僑自倫敦撤退、雖非表示日本卽將立刻加入歐戰、惟英國當悉日人所以撤退者、並非因在該處生活及進行商業感受困難之故焉、」惟「中外新聞」則稱、除非英美公開對三强公的表示種種猜疑、或對日本採取不利之行動、否則日本自　與彼等繼續維持友好之關係、「中外新聞」並中張日本應密切注視英美未來之種種動態云、（四日合衆電）</p>
<p>英報評論日本之政策　自趨魯莽滅裂之途</p>
<p>倫敦「泰晤十報」社論言日本在德義日盟的中之關係謂、納粹外交目的固甚顯明、惟日本從新盟的中所可希望獲取者究為何物、則此問題殊屬費解、日本政治家當然振振有詞、以為如德國擊敗英國並以干涉美洲事件之威脅使美國不能動員、則日本將為太平洋中莫可與爭之主人翁、凡堅持自己見解者、自不免抱德國力量足以何此成績之信念、茲姑認此項信念為不誤、然日本已因歐洲戰爭狀態而獲有其可所得之種種利益矣、德國已竭其最大能力、擬擊破英國而軟化美國矣、此外德國不能別有作為以取悅日本也、今之三國聯盟未有可增進德國能力或加強其軍事努力之處、徒使日本為雖目光極短者亦知其空洞無物之利益、而招將來不可計算之後果而已、日本之在亞、猶德國之在歐、如採行和平合作之途徑、則未嘗不可在中國經濟發展中、佔出人頭地而為人尊重之地位乃竟效法德國、缺少對此工作之必要自信以與自製力、而墜入魯莽滅裂之途徑、英美曾屢次設法、欲對於日本之需要成立同情的諒解、及日方視為示弱表徵而利用英美之委曲求全為其繼續侵略之起點、過去三年來之日本行徑、常有意對西方諸國挑釁、今進一步而與軸心國聯盟、要知此為日本前進中之最後一步、日本外交政策向以愼重著名、今乃放棄之、誠可悲已、有一國焉、聞此盟的而表示欣幸者厥為中國、蓋其目光遠大之執政者、確信日本旣有意招致英美之敵對、適自出賣其前途、而受德國失敗後之惡果耳、（路透電）</p>
<p>中國尚未採取步驟　召回駐德法使節</p>
<p>重慶　路透社自負責方面探悉、國民政府尙未採取步驟召還中國駐德法兩大使及駐義代辦、但英國重行開放緬甸公路以後、是吾將採取任何肚項行動、則頗多揣測、（四日路透社電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>從米價談到囤米</h3>
<p>輓近最高白粳竟售九十五六元向所未有之高價，雖日，此為絕少數之米之價格，不足以為準繩，然而其他之米價，已為之帶高矣。本報早有鑒及此，夙已主張國洋米應同樣評價，免致此漲彼升，互為應答，其無奈並此評價工作，而亦不能照常進行，遂使米市投機肆無忌憚，暗盤高價，層出不窮，致有今日之非常價格。米商囤戶固心滿意驕，大利在握，笑逐顏開，而不念茫茫人海中相對作牛衣泣，欲求饘粥一飽而不可得，蓋不知有幾何人。有為之解日，國米貴可食洋米，洋米貴可食米菉，然則若米菉亦貴將奈何？嘗見求平糶之男女老幼，黎明起待，日中始兌，糴得升合米，療得一日飢，然而摩肩挨背，雁行鵠立，稍一不愼，則鞭箠隨之。夫何為受此慘苦蹂躪哉？蓋昔日之所獲，以之維持昔日生活而有餘；今日之所得，以之維持生活則不足，是皆有資力之囤戶，與投機操縱之米商為之厲階也。無囤戶，米價決不至有漲無跌，無操縱，米縱貴，亦不至貴至如此地步。而况今之囤米豈易為，九十餘元一包之洋米，一百二十餘元一包之粳米，百包已非萬金不辦，况所囤恒在數千包，數萬包，故非有數十萬數百萬之資力，無從下手；非具有勢力，不敢囤積；蓋囤積換縱民食，既為法令所當嚴懲，亦為市政當局所欲取締；而仍敢冒此大不韙者，是必有其所依附，所假託，所夤緣，有非法律所能制裁，亦非輿論所能動彈，而後敢作敢為敢於向民食弋利，敢於向大衆壓迫；以是囤戶必大有人在，而囤戶之為誰，迄未聞有所舉發也。非無人也，城狐社鼠，有所憑藉也；非不懲也，投鼠忌器，有所却顧也。於是米價升漲之勁　罕有其匹，此非空言以恫世，姑以二號白粳言，二十五年之平均價為九元九角，二十六年為十一元九角，二十七年為十二元一角。三年之中，戰事期內，米價固猶平穩若是也。及二十八年各物投機無不獲大利，於是投機分子復向米市塲中活動，是年一月至七月，米價自十一元五角高至十九元三角尙不為高。入月之後，逐月高漲，遂至三十八元八角。及至本年，自三十八元有零之米價，至十月而高至九十元以上，九倍於滬戰發生之年之米價。即換算為英鎊以計値，二十五年為一百四十五便士，今則姑以最低之一便士半計算，（實際上不止此）為三百十五便士，亦一倍以上其値矣。故米價之上漲，為最近一年間事。此一年中何以米價驟高至如此地步，除囤積居奇以外，別無可以為之說明者。今年農曆歲首，米市紅盤，已多傳說，將來米價非至百元小可，故當時米價直綫而上，其後稍經曲綫之波折，然百元之價已在目前矣，謂非米商預期之行動、必欲造此高價而後已，雖百喙其奚辭。回憶民國十八年米價暗盤最高至廿三元，當時輿論多所指摘，然以昔視今，亦猶小巫之見大巫耳！夫囤積不能無，有囤積亦所以為民食謀積儲，故云囤積皆可誅，非持平公恕之論。至謂囤積但知以牟利為目的，是固營利事業之本色，不足為囤積病。蓋將本求利，居積計盈、人情之常，應有之計也。惟囤積乃至於危害民食，不顧公衆之生活、而惟私利之豐殖，是乃可誅而不可恕耳！固明知今日奸商敢於作祟，為其狡兔三窟，不得志於此，可得志於彼耳！雖然，奸商猶是人也，人知虐待禽畜為可憫，而欲以人道待之，獨不念以人道待人乎！夫能以人道待人、則奸商亦自知不能出於人情法理之外，終必知所忌憚而或有所不敢為。然若冥頑不靈，良知何在，則非施以深切之敎訓，不足以醒其錮蔽之頭腦。是故此後對於囤戶應有之處置，實為安定今日上海民食切要之圖也。</p>
<p>至評價工作，如何繼續進行：未來民食，如何設法調劑，竊以為今日之所急，在有切實之行動，不在乎官樣之文告。用一分精力，有一分成就，果眞關心民瘼，痌　在抱。深知上海租界之治安。所繫於民食之安全者至鉅，能不劍及屨及，而惟民食問題之解決是求乎！</p>

<p>河內　法國當局今日宣稱、日人之舉動、已超越九月廿二日之法日協定之範圍、惟至現時為止、彼等尙未進一步提出關於越南東京省以外之領土要求、據該發言人稱、日人將在河內繼續設立海陸軍司令部、在河內設立司令部一事、本不在法日協定之內、同時、角田少將已於昨日到達河內、以替代西原少將之職、按西原少將已被召回東京云、角田少將機續與法方談判、日軍昨日巳開始進駐吉亞蘭之飛機塲、當時有日本飛機一架、載有水手數名、自廣州飛來、首批兵士二百名、包括軍官在內、亦巳到達、作為駐吉關之防軍、革於經華南日軍猛攻後而加以佔領之諒山、一般情形、巳大見穩定、因衆信日軍巳迅速與法當局成立協議也、法方稱、前被日本所俘之法籟及安南兵士二千一百名、或將於今日到達此間、海防附近之砲壘數座、巳由日軍交還法方、故法國旗已再度飛揚於其問、法哨兵亦已接防云、日方輜重昨日巳離開海防、駐於該地之兵士將為九白名、其中七百名、係用以中持運輸事宜、（四日合衆社電）</p>

<p>男子性健康是愛情的動力……也是使人生美化的因素、創造世界的發動機……</p>
<p>人是感情的動物，人敦無情。人類因為有了情的作用，家族才能繁榮，社會才能組成，人生也就美化起來，世界也就呈現着活潑，光明，而更有繼續不斷的進步。要是人而無情，那根本就沒有家族，朋友，親戚……等人倫的關係，社會組織是土崩瓦解，世界是呈現着一種多麼冷冰冰的樣子。不特此也，並且人們的吃飯將視同吃藥，男女的結婚將視同苦工，人類世界更將有絕滅的危險！所以我們一個人的情是不可少的東西。</p>
<p>情是性的表現，性是情的根本，情之發生是完全根據於性能。我們就拿愛情來作比喻一個男子如果有着雄健的性能，一旦與健美多姿的女郎結婚，他們伉儷問的愛情必然熱烈而豐富。眞所謂靈肉一致，你愛我食，朝歡暮樂度着幸福的生活，在這種情形之下，他們的精神與肉體是完全融解在一起，你的就是我的，我的就是你的，眞所謂無分你我。我安慰了你，同時也安慰了我自己，他們愛情的立塲，是何等强固！同時他們愛情結晶的子女，也必然聰明伶俐，所組家庭，必然美滿而甜蛋，他們的生活是多麼的美化而愉快呀！要是一個男子如果於早年犯有自凟與遺精，或婚後的荒淫縱慾與憂勞斵傷之故，患有滑精漏精，精力渙散，神經衰弱，發育不全，精薄不育等症，則雖有嬌妻美妾，無奈在性生活上每望風披靡，此在男子固已醒醐灌頂萬事皆休，但在滿腔熱情正待慰求歡渴的居下位者，將是如何痛心疾首的事。因此，愛情破裂，在家庭間演出種種悲劇！在男子方面。甚或造成未老先衰，早年殀殤！聰明丈夫欲謀補救，據世界名醫及余經騐，均公認服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，最為對症特效。因此劑係由雄壯動物如猿猴猩猩等體中提取的生殖腺素用科學方法複製而成，服後於一日夜間卽能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，若能繼續服用，必可於短期內將上述各症完全治愈，并可收延年益壽返老還潼之效。惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片，」以固精關，制止遺精，則標本兼治，收效尤速！</p>

<p>不幸萎　應速求科學的補救造物的神秘和巧妙，簡直沒有什麼言語可以形容。妳瞧：如果一個靑年女子，有了縷縷的柳腰，豐膄的臀部，而不加上一對高聳的乳峯，在胸前扶搖生姿，那麼女性最美妙的曲線，便無由造成，怎能神秘肉感，到處受人的尊敬與愛慕呢？所以世界者名的美容專家兼生理學家康德林和婦科名醫湯潑生等，要這樣的說：女子的乳峯，如果愈高而愈有彈性，不但在美容方面，可以和醫部腰身，構成最神秘的曲線，使每個男子見了，都發生一種良好的感覺之外，同時因着她們卵巢機能的健全，新陳代謝作用的旺盛，性情無不曠達柔順。肌肉無不晶瑩潔白，思想更無不靈敏而周密，雖遇難題當前，都能條分縷析的處理之，不革於感到應付困雞，此外更因血液循環的充暢，在面部便泛起了桃花迎人一般的笑靨，雖然脂粉不施，也是豔麗非常，年齡雖增，而靑春長駐，兩性生活，更是無艮甜蜜，組織着快樂而幸福的家庭，生育着健壯而活潑的子女，此種女子，眞是多麼幸福而可愛啊！但過去因自凟束胸，月經不調，白帶不感諸症，以致卵巢機能衰弱。影響乳峯發育者，則補救辦法，祗有從速服以卵巢製劑女用「生殖素」，則一日夜間既可培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月以，使</p>
<h3>遺精癥的最新療法</h3>
<p>— 性病專　科醫師　詹念會</p>
<p>一失足成千古恨！這是警告靑年人在春情發動期莫因意志薄弱而誤入歧途。誠然，人生在靑年的階段中為奠定前途光明和幸福基礎的時期。此時應如何的鍛鍊體格，攻磋學術，以期將來能任重而致逮。可是當今的一般靑年雖然也有少數在淸醒地努力着，但大多數均在醉生夢死中，終臼渾渾噩噩，為環境所支配，克制不住自身性的刺激，犯上手淫者比比皆是。不知不罪，這在我們尙不深惡痛極他們。所最壞的犯有手淫後仍不覺悟，致惡癖加深，機起了遺精。因為一有精遺，體內的精液不特不能貯藏，且有枯竭之虞！要是精液一枯，則腦，脊髓，性三大神經，無不受其嚴重的影響。凡腦力衰弱，頭腦脹痛，健忘失眠，腰痠背痛，滑精漏精，早洩陽萎等症即相繼而來，此外因發育機能受阻，致性器短小一如童稚，精液的產生不及，缺乏精蟲，造成精薄不育等症。如此靑年，不特在學術與職業上不能努力，前途黯淡！就是在傳宗接代的夫婦生活上，亦每不能圓滿履行，致為妻痛一恨，演出家庭悲劇！或子嗣艱難，遺終生大憾！聰明青年欲謀補救，唯有速服「希米脫氏固精片」以固精關，鎮靜神經，使夢幻減少，則遺精即可痊愈，如因遺精已引起上述徵象者，須兼服生殖線素製劑「生殖素」以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，則上述各癥即可於短期內治愈，並可使身體益增健康，若患者能親來本診所就專家醫師診斷後，施用電療，注射，手術等最新療法，更可保證治愈。</p>

<h3>戰歐叢談（十八）　英機轟炸魯爾紀實</h3>
<p>本文為一年二十七歲的空軍戰士，（著者姓名，因軍事關係，不願發表）於本年七月中旬，偕同伴三人，駕雙引擎亨潑頓轟炸機，夜襲魯爾的紀實。著者至本年七月十一日止，曾先後飛往德境轟炸三十决之多，開戰初，駕機飛德散發傳單决數，猶未計算在內。原文載美國Life雜誌，茲譯述如左：</p>
<p>我於下午六時，奉召至參謀部，聽取轟炸德國魯爾區某項目標的訓令。我於魯爾區域前已去過多决，卽使閉了眼睛也能飛往。在哈姆火車站調車塲上空，我和兩位弟兄，對着滿載軍火自漢堡開往愛森的火車，大肆轟炸。陶德門附近愛姆士運河中的載貨駁船，也被我們投彈。此外我們又轟炸了杜易斯堡一家工廠。</p>
<p>我們的目標分散在各處。出發之時天已垂暮，先把裝載就緒的亨潑頓機作最後的檢點。旋卽起飛。夜凉如水，晶瑩皎潔，我知道全程飛航當無不快之感。向東飛行，我把機身漸漸昇至一萬五千尺的空中。這時候正是晚上十一點鐘。</p>
<p>機關槍手們照例從「傳話機」中交談。他們分處在上下機槍室中，麥克在上，柏台在下。在這漫漫長夜的飛航中，他們大談共足球經騐，亘一小時之久。我的轟炸瞄準手塔斐，嘴裏總是喃喃怨語，不滿於這夜間的天色。無論夜間的天色如何好，他老是要發牢騷的。我曾在傳話機中喊過他一次，所聽到的回話祗是那些不淸不楚的語音。我又猜到他，這時候一定又在大吃其朱古律糖和橘子，作為空襲時向例的消遣了。</p>
<p>我們飛近荷蘭，但見一片鳥黑。淺平的沙灘與海水溶而為一。靠北面，我一看就知道是黑耳郭蘭灣和「風角」上空的高射砲火，探照燈之類，把天空照得很光亮，原來別的英國飛機早在基爾湊過熱鬧了。我們穿過荷蘭，直向杜易斯堡前進。</p>
<p>六千呎之下起了個雲堆。探照燈的光芒穿射在前面，一片光明燦爛的雲海，煞是好看。我心中正在想，在這雲層之上，有了掩蔽，很為安全；忽聽得柏台從下面機槍室中向麥克說道：「底下有六隻戰鬭機……我想是德國的梅案斯密特式……它們迅速地飛昇上來了……快些」。他從光明的雲層中可以很淸楚的看到它們的黑影子。當然德機中人也能看到我們。我把機身傾側一下，使上面機槍室中的麥克，得以窺察敵機所在，把機槍瞄準起來。</p>
<p>英吉林海峽上空之英機</p>
<p>柏台嘴裏咕嚕着：「它們倒不飛攏來，可恥的東西……」。麥克一時性起，好像德機中人能够聽到似的：「飛起來，飛起來，我們來決鬭一塲」。但是德機並不飛攏來。它們躲在老遠，旋卽不見。</p>
<p>我在這時候，倒有許多事情引上心頭。我們已飛到萊茵河邊機身漸漸如輕羽下降，穿過雲層。底下淡淡的一片月色，把我們地上的目標烘托出來。我把機身徒然傾測，又把管理桿扳向後背，機身漸昇，又</p>
<p>不多一刻，我從傳聲機中告知同伴，現在我們要預備作戰了。我抑止着機桿，把機鼻直衝下去。塔斐找到了目標之後，叫我緊握着不動。我們穿過高射砲火，直衝而下，高度表飛一般的在轉動，六千呎，五千呎，四千呎。風聲和馬達尖銳聲互鳴着，不久我們已到了砲火的中央了。那轟發喧鬧的聲音，令人心驚肉跳。我尋目標的探照燈直射在飛機窗孔之外，高射砲彈如連珠般的直射上來。短射程的高射砲彈在穿過了另一目標。卽使沒有這些標識，我們也能達到目的。像以後一樣，德兵把我們所要的目標照燃得亮亮的。整個的社易斯堡被探照燈，照明彈等弄得光亮如同白晝。還有一種發光的東西，燦爛閃耀，浮在空中，好像聖誕樹上所掛着的光箔，卽極美麗，叉殊可怕。我們上昇的時候，向這些發光的東西觀望了一會，在探照燈的光圈，和高射砲火的射程之外，翱翔打旋。</p>
<p>滿天空，機身的上面和前面，充滿了高射砲火，砲彈炸彈爆發的聲音，比了我們飛機的馬達叫哮聲還要響。何以如此，我也明白。前面很低的地方，巳經有別的英國飛機前去投彈。工廠房屋一部份已中彈起火。德國砲隊和高射砲隊顯然很忙碌的正在招架別的飛機，也來不及睬我們了。我們在砲火探照燈光之外打旋，以待炸彈爆聲的靜息。</p>
<p>我們機身之下爆炸，機身為之盪動。塔斐總是叫我把住方位。「靠右一些……不耍動。靠左一些……不要動」。我依着他所說的，使機身取得平衡。當我放鬆機桿向後之時，把炸彈選擇桿拖出來，預備塔斐來撳動機鈕。</p>
<p>在這一霎時間，地下的探照燈，我尋我們了。我祇把眼光集中在機錶板上。從格板的小孔中望下去，我瞥見塔斐的頭背影正對着炸彈瞄準鏡，由於下面射上來的火光，益顯得黑影十分淸楚。機身忽然浮昇而震動，我知道第一批的炸彈已經投下去了。在同一時間，一團高射炮彈在下面爆發，幾乎擊中我們的背部，砲彈爆炸之時，機身大大的動盪，好像人的頭部中了一擊。我不知道機身有沒有中彈，我只是把機身再弄到平衡的方位，機錶板上的指針等。儀器雖然都跳動不已，馬達的吼聲倒還正常。</p>
<p>機槍手把眼睛直釘在地上，看我們所投的炸彈如何發作。雖然時間僅有一二秒，倒像過了幾分鐘。柏台從傳聲機中大喊道：「向右」。塔斐總覺得不能十二分的瞄準——又恐放炸彈的時候，要被高射砲彈射着。我從高射砲火中滑穿過去，避免劇烈的衝激，但是探照光總是牢牢的釘着我們。總算沒有吃着彈火，不多一刻探照燈亦失其所在了。</p>
<p>打了個轉灣，我又開始飛到目標物的上空，想弄到格外準確的方位。塔斐瞄準之後，我們又在高射砲火的中心了。照明彈浮昇在機身的左右，所發的綠熖把　艙照耀得很亮。左舷一聲爆炸，通至炸彈瞄準手的傳聲機被炸壞了。我只能依照着最後所瞄準的方位，使機身平衡不動。這一次我們可以很淸楚的看到地上的目標了。我甚至看到廠屋裏的火舌從桁梁中間穿出來。。</p>
<p>第二批炸彈投擲下去的時候，機身又震動浮昇而上，我把機身傾側一下探頭下望，這時候探照燈不是照不着我們，就是已經熄滅了。我可以聽到柏台和麥克正噼噼啪啪的在那裹大開其機關槍。這一次所投下去的炸彈並非虛發。我先看幾秒鐘之內一切大為混亂，我不知道後來怎樣飛行的。也不明白有否其他動作，我從傳聽機中通知其餘船員，叫他們準備用跳傘逃生，可是我喉問發燒，嘴唇乾枯，只得輕輕的說了幾句。談們並沒有聽到我的話——其實在這樣的高空中，跳下去也不能倖免哩。</p>
<p>漸漸的一切叉恢復原狀了。塔斐已能從傳聲機中講話。他為砲火所包圍而受傷，在機身轉側的時候，幾乎出了大亂子，兩個機槍手倒還好，不過弄得額上東腫一塊，西生一瘤。亨潑頓式轟炸機不像戰鬥機般的靈活而能顛倒自如。塔斐仍極鎮靜，不多一刻嘴裏又在咕哩咕哩，問我是不是要飛往愛　區的火車站去，找尋調車塲的目標。我叫塔斐先上來，把拿機錶板上的燈修好，因為我坐在駕駛座上不能去瞎摸。燈光回復之後，我們就向火車站塲進發。</p>
<p>現在已是上午一時了，我們在杜易斯堡上空不過帶留了一點鐘左右，回想起來好像已過了一年。馬達很平穩的鼓勵著向愛森區上空飛去。探照燈又射上來，時向照著我們，時向照不著。往哈姆及陶德門，愛姆士運河途中，高射砲火非常猛烈，我們穿越火網向前。麥克和柏台一路間講，大談其在蘇格蘭捕薩門魚的經過。</p>
<p>不多一刻，火車站塲已在面前。我探首下望，看見許多滿載貨物的火車齊集在一個交叉點。從四千呎高空望下去，竟是一目了然。高射砲又轟轟的向上開，這時候我也顧不得一切了。我筆直衝下去，穿過火網。叉把炸彈選擇桿拖過來，準備投最後一批炸彈。塔斐瞄準之後，片刻間最後一批炸彈放下去了。它們正中目標，炸在鐵道交匯點和一列車的上面。</p>
<p>我們的飛機直下降，打轉灣，直至離地三百尺，仔細看一看地面上所受的損失如何。火車站的小屋已經起火，鐵軌炸裂，當我們飛過的時候，有些鐵軌已飛入高空之中，迎面又有高射炮彈飛來，我把管理桿用力一扳，這時候倒沒有像在杜易斯堡上空那樣危險了。我們在杜易斯堡兩决轟炸，以求獲得準確的目標之後，這時候在陶德門區已無彈可投，於是開足速率，重行飛返本國。（完）</p>

<h3>滇緬路決將開放　英美蘇積極援華　因三國同盟更促成合作　美續貸華鉅款支持抗戰</h3>
<p>外籍兩權威剖析最近國際局勢</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨訪外籍觀察家某君於其高恩路寓决、縱談歐亞局勢、當其論及三國同盟時、微笑語記者曰、三國同盟除予日本以艱重責任外、別無其他效用、察其動機、似欲對英美有所恫嚇、但英美將因之更形合作、美蘇關係、亦有改善趨勢、德國前會揚言欲越英吉利海峽、直搗英倫、但以海軍劣勢、無法前進、繼乃以大規模之空襲策略、企圖毀損英國實力、但嬰國皇家空軍、似叉非德國之敵、而空襲結果、非但不足以减弱英國之戰鬭力量及意志、抑且增强英國內部之團結、以及美國對英之同情及援助、</p>
<p>遠東方面　有利中國此次德義日三國同盟、更引起英美之强烈反感、而進一步獲得誠意之各方面合作、德國此舉、行將證明其為大不智、卽在遠東方面、亦徒造成中國之有利局勢、蘇聯卽無三國同盟的上之的束、似更可具體援華、美國欲維持其遠東權益、貸款乃屬必然結果、而英國之考慮開放滇緬路、亦未始非三</p>
<p>開滇緬路　不成問題</p>
<p>記者又問及開放滇緬路之是吾能成事實、據該觀察家稱、開放滇緬路、似已不成問　、蓋英國當時除在歐洲與德義樹立敵對形勢外、其他世界各國在可能範圍內、均予相當妥協周旋、封鎖滇緬路、卽為企圖與日妥協周旋之舉動、但英國民衆對此舉動、十九不表贊同、目下離開放期不遠、英國上下、已有促使政府開放之要求、在此時際、卽發生三國締盟之事、則日本顯已與英國亦成對敵形勢、英國自無再予妥協之必要與可能、故三月期滿之後、重行開放、似已不成問題、</p>
<p>美國續有　鉅款貸華</p>
<p>美國援華積極、除貸借二萬五千萬元美金外、復有一萬三千萬美元貸華、平明社記者昨特向本埠某外籍金融界權威方面探詢、據稱美國續有鉅款貸華、其數目上海方面未能獲得證實消息、惟知中政府代表宋子文在美國繼續進行鉅大借款、頗為順利、亦殊屬可能之事、然以常理推測、此後美國在經濟上、必將繼續支持中國、此决借額、就數量言、雖不算大、而就其性質言、亦非純粹借款、祇是預先放款、收臃中國之鵭礦、</p>
<p>支持中國　亦復自衛</p>
<p>中國三年來抗戰之結果、已造成遠東不可輕唬之勢力、中國之需要各友邦在經濟上援助、亦猶在太平洋上各友邦之需要中國為削弱侵略者勢力之前哨，此點美國早已認識淸楚、故支持中國之抗戰、卽所以鞏固其外圍、美國不得不助華者、其理由就在此、</p>
<p>美國不變　傳統政策</p>
<p>再由美國傳統政策言之、美國對華政策、吾人皆知、是所謂門戶開放政策、此項政策、吾人須知、是建築於所謂太平洋均勢之上、然而此項均勢之確立、非美一國之力量所能達、故必須英國為其有力之支持、始能辦到、華盛頓會議時、英國不繼續英日同盟、以全力支持美國、結果能成立華盛頓條的、此一局勢至一九三一年九一八時而告終、其所以若此之原因、卽由於彼時之英國不與美國合作、共同對侵略者制裁、結果造成太平洋上之不可收拾局面、</p>
<p>英美合作　勢所必然</p>
<p>然而此一局勢、隨西歐戰爭之擴大、及太平洋方面形勢之急轉直下、英國地位之相形降落、美國地位之相形增高、美國地位有舉足輕重之勢、而英國為獲得美國援助、在太平洋、在大西洋、都不能不以美國之馬首是瞻、故英美在世界之合作、乃必然趨勢、英國為其自身利益、及為獲得美國之援助、巳不能不放棄其所幻想之綏靖政策、而予中國積極援助、開放滇緬路及以大宗款項借與中國、乃其分內事、</p>
<p>上海局勢　暫可無慮</p>
<p>記者又提出南進政策下、上海地位如何之問題、據某金融家之意見、上海之地位、亦為遠東局勢一環、自視國際形勢而定、然可斷言者、在目前狀况下、英美之態度轉為强硬、日本雖加入德義同盟、為中國事變所牽涉、無此力量從事對第三國戰爭、故短期內、仍可維持相當穩定、</p>
<h3>法商水電工潮　即可解決　今日續開談判</h3>
<p>遷延一旬之法租界水電公司電車公共汽車引擎間罷工工潮、自勞方代表請求法捕房政事部予以調解後、僵局已有打開之跡象、前昨兩日、勞資雙方且已兩度接觸、聞勞方將再度籲請各界人士予以援助、茲將昨日所獲詳情、分誌於后、</p>

<p>英文大美　報云、今晨（四日）據法商電車公司某員聲稱、法租界電車與公共汽車業務、可望於明日（五日）恢復如常、勞資雙方談話、正順利進行、</p>
<p>三人被綁</p>
<p>昨日上午一時許、又有三人被綁、許廿六號·廿八號·查票兩名、十號寫票一名、此三人究被架往何處、雖經有關方面極力搜查、但終未得有線索、現法捕房及公司方面、異常重視此類事件之繼續發生、並據社聞社記者探悉、昨日中午、法捕房曾派出中西幹員多名、在霞飛路維爾蒙路附近、捕獲電車公司售票員六、名據聞與綁案有關、</p>
<h3>傳美商銀行　即將拒售外匯　其目的係為對日商而發　美貨運內地已悉遭統制</h3>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、同盟社昨（三日）夜消息稱、本市美商銀行日後將拒絕出售外滙、雖未特別規定僅對日商拒售外滙、然金融觀察家相信美銀行此舉實對日商行而發、以其緊隨日本與德義締結盟的、而取此步驟也、或有以美銀行此舉、並非對日本加入軸心而施之經濟報復為言者、然亦承認此乃美銀行之預防辦法、蓋恐美日關係續趨惡化也、</p>
<p>沿海封鎖　美貨被阻</p>
<p>據另一方面意見日方沿中國海岸嚴施封鎖、美貨運入中國內地、因而减少、且淪陷區內有關出口之銀行業務、多由日商經手、美銀行之發售出口單營業、乃被截斷、美銀行營業卽受損失、遂有拒售外滙之舉、反予日商以打擊，</p>
<p>日商不安　另謀應付</p>
<p>若干觀察家則以為華人對英鎊漸失信心、今乃對美金作投機事業、美商行遂拒售外滙、以期减少此種投機活動、至於日方銀行界原巳料及柏林締結公的後、上海金融市塲必有反響、現定短期內集議、商討應付辦法、聞日方銀行將經法比銀行之手、以謀美金期貨交易之交割、</p>
<p>各棉紡號　影響最鉅</p>
<p>同時、受美銀行此舉影響最大之日商各棉紡號方面稱、美銀行拒售外滙、結果將使美國棉花出口、續見减少、且棉紡商巳購有外匯、暫時不致受其影響、其他各業日商領袖亦將不能輸入新貨、但可在本市向中外入口商轉購其所需貨物、</p>

<h3>金融　外匯出籠</h3>
<p>外匯的臼市况、匯豐掛牌、悉無上洛、英美匯暗市、又見鬆硬、投機商鎭日拋售美滙先令同時告長、午後更傳法日衝突、消息利空、是以經營者繼續出籠、價卽呈鬆、本月份美匯五元五六二五、頗多成交、惟晚收前買賣轉稀、潛勢稍回、結果英鬆〇四六八七五、為三辦士五六二五、美硬〇三一二五、為五元五三一二五、期貨美匯仍與現貨軋平、英金微形拔開、</p>
<p>市場消息利空</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近平遠跌〇六二五、紐的銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、滙兌英對美不動、對滬亦平、美對英未更、對滬小四分、對法無市、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士五一五六二五、美匯五元牛、比上日收市、英美兩匯俱平、開後無人顧問、市面帶硬、外行首先對做現先令三辦士荒三一二五、不久華商投機家入市吐　、本月份美匯五元五三一二五、與五六二五、匯豐掛牌悉無上落、白銀平衡稅揭曉仍徵百分之二西·二五、此後因港電頗有吃胃、潛勢告定、計港電進美行本月份美滙五元五三一二五、嗣因華行等亦跟扒、一度回緊、華行向美行買入本月份美匯改為荒元半、但至午刻、投機商突來賣出、價依然轉平、計投機商出外行十一月份美滙五元五三一二五、午收英金三辦士五三一二五、美滙五元五三一二五、比晨開英美各長〇一五六二五、與〇三一五、</p>
<p>午後賣風更盛</p>
<p>午後初開、突傳法日衝突、形勢緊張、致一時人心稍受影響、投機商吐售更勇、賣予某美行及有利本月份五元五六二五、惟以後買賣轉淸、價乃告平、晚收英金三辦十五六二五、美匯五元五三一二五、本月份與現貨價相同、十一月份先令三辦士五四六八七五、美匯亦為五元五三一二五、比上日英長〇六八七五、美鬆〇三一二五，</p>
<p>香港英平美緊</p>
<p>香港四日（週五）常、今晨匯市開盤告平、英滙現期貨及日滙現貨均無變動、美匯現貨縮〇六二五、為二十三元三七五、申滙現貨降元、為四百工十三元、九特四十分華　微軟、現貨緊〇六二五、為二十三元三一二五、十時三十五分回平、美匯現貨仍為二十三元三七五、十一時平穩、申滙現貨降一元、為四百一十二元、十一時三十分平穩、各匯概無變動、下午二時三十分開盤平穩英匯現貨鬆二五、為二十三元半、申匯現貨續降三元、為四百十九元、其餘不動、</p>

<h3>金市復挫</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤向下游挫落，乃外匯報硬、並有利空消息傳來、人心頗受震動、增加不少賣戶、午盤尙因空戶抵補、走勢盤旋、一度曾出九百元關外、但後市一蹶不振、結果五千八百叫十二元收盤、較上日小四十一元、全日交易的三千元光景、銀樓飾金終則不更、關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤軋小四十元</p>
<p>晨初以人心尙堅、雖外滙帶硬、而檯而賣戶極少、銀號出金號二十兩、為五千八百八十元作開盤價、且不久銀號入市猛吸、立出九百元嬰外計銀號進金號十兩、五千九百〇八元、終以外滙仍鬆、錢兌業金號猛塞、遂卽挫跌、計證券幫出金號二十兩、五千八百六十元、後錢兌業轉手補空、價又回高、計銀號入證券幫三十兩、五千八百八十元、不料近午金銀號等咸賣、勢難支持、低達五千八百五十元、結果銀號對做十兩、為五千八百五十八元作午收價、後市開出更見疲象、此因利空傳說盛熾、外滙續鬆、銀號售予金號二十兩、為五千八百三十元、作開盤價、嗣銀號進證券幫十兩、五千八百四十元、而斯時金銀號在售、破入八百元關內、證券幫出銀號十兩、為五千七百九十元、尙以證券幫銀號乘賤搜進、重出八百元關外、金號入銀號二十兩、五千八百四十八元、結果金號對做十兩、五千八百四十二元作晚收價、較上日軋小四十一元、現金號之本牌金售價、較烚赤高十數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>首飾金鎮日不動</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、終日無上落、計大同行掛六百元、新同行與上價相仿、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>從買賣商標談起</h3>
<p>— 蔡杰棟</p>
<p>商標名義上楚商品的標記。事實上是代表着整個的商品，　謂「老牌子」一詞，便是商標的意義更超過於商品的表現。商標的本身有一種無形的價値存在，而於商品自身有了異動，商標發生轉讓的情事時，商標便更確定的顯出它本身的價値，作為商品標記的商標，便成為也是商品的一種了。</p>
<p>這種情事雖不多見，但近來却是有得見到，並且不再是一種單純的轉讓，而是如批發莊一般的躉批拆賣，商標本身同時也是一種商品的意義便更見得明顯。這種現象應運而生，是發生在目前特種情狀下。</p>
<p>為了對付「經濟封鎖。對於貨物入口，均須經審查始　輸入，而為使商人便於遵循起見。並鑒定某數種出品准予入口。此外則概不准輸入。但經鑒定准許輸入的商標，與他廠發生了交換行為，一方將貨物冒用了這種商標便得自由輸入，故願付以相當代價，一方坐享其利，樂得出賣，管他正理與公義，抹殺了准許這種商標的商品進口的好意。商婦不知亡國恨，隔江猶唱後庭花，今之奸商並此而不如，</p>
<h3>外幣一致下落</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤由堅穩而趨下落、英美金鎊亦係先堅而後疲、終於各跌五角、英金票供求相埒、市價站平、美金票趨勢軟弱、市價終落一角二分、香港票稍有供給、市價略軟一分、臼金票供求仍勻、晚市仍站一元四角六分原盤、朝鮮票不乏洪求者、晚市退為一元一角五分、</p>
<h3>糧食　新粳回小　厚薄粳居奇　洋米漲跌多</h3>
<p>洋米市自經前朝一度回跌後、昨開因各洋行定米有三四電打出、一般浮戶爭先求脫、繼之實銷不動、價遂涉降、至中市各價猛瀉元半以上、旋因國外定價尙難鬆落、西貢等復電合申仍與前市相似、故一般行囤大戶尙不肯隨手輕晚、二號西貢英華司銀行棧仍開至八十二元、洋棧八十元、十月上期為七十九元六角、均與前日售價相同、及至午後、有獲利出籠、且國際謠言不利於買方、故在午市回漲之行情又復下跌、現洋米結果小二元許、卽回籠英華司原包現二號西貢小至七十八元半左右、二號暹邏原包現貨祇七十七元許、全日原包成交四五百噸、現米的四千五六百包、若二號西貢為六十八元三角、六十八元、二號暹邏六十六元半、六十六元、小絞六十五元半、米茶六十八元次至六十七儿、</p>
<p>厚薄粳當洋米跌風熾烈、市貨竟告匿跡、後雖回昂、又不願求脫、致終市半粒無交、悉未嬰出耳、糯米去路本　、至此影響所及、更難支持、遂被帶落元砠、金溧特元開七十三元、常丹貨七十一二元、香港糯相同、糯菉未有成交、</p>
<p>新粳尖日來河下到貨頗旺、不下一千三四百石、而允以身骨潮軟、不耐久守、貨主均圖急脫為快、但銷化不良、結果新粳竟暴瀉四五兀之巨、羊杜尖並墮三四元不等、計開顓橋新粳八十二元、太倉羊尖七十元六十九元、靑角杜尖七十二元、</p>
<h3>客銷一動　紛市步緊</h3>
<p>麵粉　臼昨粉市步趨暗緊、查二號粉廠盤雖為十六元五角而各廠供應、逐漸减少、因運日有客帮動辦、現粉已不敷供給、更兼米價高翔、益使人心看好、是以投機囤戶、復在收買棧單、老車棧單巳緊至十八元一二角、尙鮮供出、洋粉以現底不充、售價與廠粉客盤同為十八元五六角、聞南北帮添辦近萬包、本街批價、恐有提高之勢、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日交易續告平靜、到貨依然淸稀、運入租界者更多困難、所以買賣迄難開展、聞零星解送日廠貨價限二十一元原盤、華廠收進仍為二十四元六角半作價、惟粉市轉緊、貨方咸有扳價之意、故成交愈感淸淡也、</p>
<h3>內債興奮　又見新高價</h3>
<p>證券喑盤、昨市趨勢稍有變更、上午初開稍見疲軟，近收盤時仍被拉提高高午收平無榮辱、午後突因日本電報不通、引起市塲誤會、開盤後買戶極為踴躍、丙種復穿出五十九元、見九元五角新高價、惜未能立定、前途或將因浮多過、於擁擠稍起回風也、昨日上午、買戶仍以六號十六號及四十一號買進為勇、不過比隔日為少、聯和協大信孚等均有需要、同康聯益鴻大益昌均係賣出、午後買進者驟見擴大、信孚聯和及六號繼續買進、餘如信昌久豐順泰通記以及多數散戶、紛紛收買、同康聯益鴻决繼續吐出、恒康亦有出脫、市價開盤卽跳高半元、甲乙丙戊冉見高價、錦上添花。不易多得、惟收盤後聞日本電報業巳修通、一塲誤會、於是冰釋、市價結果、續漲一角至五角不等、成交總數共的一百七十萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交新亞藥廠股五十股、價為二十四元七角半、</p>
<p>昨日衆業股市、因浮多了結擁擠、價格甚形不支、價跌時買方吸胃、顯亦不弱、成交極鉅、</p>
<p>倫敦三日（週四）電今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、仍告平滯、祇銀行股略有起伏、麥加利銀行股上升二先令六便士、價為六鎊十七先令六便士、滙豐銀行英倫註冊股跌一鎊半、價為六十四鎊、香港註冊股無上落、有利銀行股跌五先令、價為十鎊零十五先令、其餘不動、</p>
<h3>紗花　投機集中　紗布直上青雲　雙馬會橫跳五十七五</h3>
<p>紗市趨堅、且漲風尤熾、此因　帮對於十支粗紗需　切、人心挺拔、同時日紗市　昂騰、致人氣愈緊、而投機者又靜極思動、　風奋熾、天津帮及同業中業外者三方齊下、於是抬風一轉、市盤乃直上靑雲矣、今日出口有紗四百十件運香港、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、因上日午後傳言紛紛、謂取引所行市巳好、塲中賣風缺乏、而買者為夥、首盤價為一千一百二十五元、漲十元、在一千一百三十元盤旋、為時甚久、旋後聞廣帮粗紗仍有辦意、同時多說某紗市價升騰、人氣突然熱烈、買戶蜂擁而來、市艦越做越高、至一千一百五十七元、收盤以後再升十元、查半日間成交統計四千二百七十包、行情二十支雙馬漲五十七元、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>同行二、九七〇香港一、三〇〇統計四二七〇</p>
<h3>現棉花一漲十元　成交以外棉居多</h3>
<p>現棉交易大為發展、此因紗布飛騰、致唇齒相依之原棉、跟踪而上升矣、所以廠方活動採辦、同行買意允濃、棉價　起十元、成交之棉、外棉居多數矣、</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐的棉市、市况靜寂、後因現貨需要增多、及一部份之空頭抵補、結果收盤價格、較之上日漲二三磅音、印度速同預測漲一羅比半、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來頗為活躍、同業間之存貨、幾有被人搜購一空之虞、廠方亦深悉外棉運滬之困難、加之紗價飛騰、廠方購意殊濃也。按照此種情勢、棉價將漲無止境也</p>
<h3>疋頭　布價隨紗　亦步亦趨</h3>

<p>出口　今日有疋頭二百二十件運香港、一百零五件運新加坡、六十件運威海衛，六百四十件運烟臺、</p>
<h3>油餅　油價有進無退</h3>
<p>昨日油市仍有進無退、刻下明生油雖有起伏波浪、但軋空之形巳漸顯露、前途潛勢無小回可言、昨結果豆油冉提二元、生油續漲三元外、成交膠州生油三百件、價為七十六元至七十六元五角、十月上交五百件、價為七十六元荒角至七角半、十月下交二千二三百件、價目七十八元升至七十八元二角半、回至七十七元五角、再復砌至七十九元收盤、靑島生油一百桶、價為一百零六零七兀、十月下交三百桶、價為一百零七元五角至一百零八元五角、十一月份交二百桶、價為一百零九元五角至一百十元、烟毫聽生油五百聽。價為一百元、膠州豆油六十件、價為八十二元五角、烟岐豆油五十件、價為八十四元、靑岐豆油二十件、價為八十三元、大連散裝油二百五十担、價為九十二元、大有廠豆油五百担、價為九十二元五角、革九十三元五角、</p>

<h3>絲茶　絲經去路　祗賴美銷</h3>
<p>昨日海外絲市堅平、紐約無大上落、橫濱現貨小十五元、遠期小二元、然仍高於維持綫三十五元、故並不足病、本埠絲市、白廠七八分聞有交易、價五二二五元、美銷去路尙宏、惟手貨零星而</p>
<h3>南北貨　圓肉見新高價</h3>
<p>海南圓肉、因來源暫阻、行方進意甚濃、號盤急遽上升、初由一百九十元而一百九十五元、繼竟破二百元大關、而見二百〇五元新高價、因此行槃亦追踪而達二百元、</p>
<h3>海　甬淡菜來源不絕</h3>
<p>自滬甬封鎖以還、航行迄未恢　、如甬方海產品僅賴民船輸運、故甬淡菜到源猶未斷絕、查近到之元淡行盤售三百六十元半、荷棉白BS嘜本綫七十五元、荷赤五十九元六角、太古車白B嘜七十五元六角、DY嘜七十三元四角、HX喀七十三元一角半，小二角革角半、HM嘜六十七元、比前（二日）小荒角、本廠冰一號九十八元半、晶明冰一百元、均降元半，</p>

<p>黑鐵坯子昨由津幫搜往達百數紥之譜、而本街印鐵廠。製罐廠。鏡子廠紀機器廠家等亦相率購辦、故一時市氣衝動、人心蓬勃、執貨者。思復熾、標準　搖直上、重闖千元大關、比前　漲百餘元、而三十號至三十四號薄貨、開價尙在一千二百元左右耳、</p>
<p>新盤元最近數天內、已超出元釘倍司而靑雲直上、刻元釘僅喊五十六七元、而盤元市價已高漲至六十一二元不等、查其原因、不但為本街製釘廠建築所熱搜、且外埠客幫去路亦已展開納胃、故有如此挺勗現象云、</p>

<h3>輸血大王</h3>
<p>— 莫名</p>
<p>一九三五年七月四日，美國費城有個三年歲的女孩羅絲瑪麗被一個頑童的爆竹炸傷了背部·瑪麗的慈愛的姨母，麥茂琳夫人（Mrs．McMnllin），立刻把她飛送到醫院去。在那裏，她的傷處被小心地淸潔起來，敷上藥，再注射了破傷風預防針。防護不可謂不周密，但她終於不免被病菌所侵襲，她的體溫扶搖直上，最後猛升到一百〇七度；她的腹部膨脹起來，兩腿腫得像條香腸。醫生發現她的血液中充滿着可怕的「化膿性金黃色葡萄球狀菌」，這種病病菌是無藥可以尅制的。醫生們搖搖頭，告訴麥茂琳夫人，說這個孩子沒有希望了，除非她能我到一個從前患過同樣疾病的輸血者。</p>
<p>麥茂琳夫人失望地跑去祈禱。在默禱中，她靈機一動，想到了一個出奇的念頭。她對醫生說了，醫生起初拒絕了這個駭人的要求，後來終於允許下來。於是瑪麗毒化了的血液被抽了出來，製成疫苗，再注射到夫人的血液中去。她馬上也生起同樣的病，同時她的血液中有大量滅菌的抗毒素製造出來，這種血液可以借給她的甥女供剿滅病菌之用，在幾天內，她一共輸了廿九决血給瑪麗，這條小生命總算從死神的魔掌給奪了回來。</p>
<p>麥茂琳夫人過去曾患過白喉，猩紅熱，風濕熱，癮毒，鍊球菌性療病，現在冉加上葡萄球菌的血疾症，她的血液變成各種抗毒素的大本營。一九三七年她聽說台拉華地方有一個孩子患着嚴重的血毒症，正奄奄待斃，她立刻趕了去一决輸血把他救了回來。後來她在夏季旅行的營帳中被人連夜請了去，也救活了一個孩子。有一决她應一個牙嬰師的緊急呼援，冒着大風雪從老遠的阿克朗飛到芝加哥。又存一次，她在紐的輸血給一個息鍊球菌性心臟內膜炎的產婦，結果母子都安。</p>
<p>她的聲名愈弄愈大，病人到了羣醫束手的時候都盼望這位救命的活菩薩從天而降。她也樂善好施地飛東跑西佈拾她寳貴的血液，有時甚至同時被兩處速駕，使她左右為難，應接不暇。</p>
<p>麥茂琳夫人現在儼然「「輸血大王」自命了。她在三年中一共輸出二百决血。她的最得意傑作是有一次在六十小時內接連的輸出了一千七百五十西西。這種大量血液的損失對於她的健康並沒有什麼妨礙，在每决輸血後，她從未感到不適意或頭痛；牠並沒有苛細的起居飮食的條件，但三年以來牠的體重反而增加十五磅。她的體格相當肥滿，看上去十分健壯，只有面頰不免略帶蒼白，但她可以用胭脂把它拖飾過去。</p>
<p>她的丈夫，威廉麥茂琳先一生，熱心贊助她這種救人的生活，時常驕傲地滔滔不絕的向人講述他夫人的故事，他是一個汽車銷售員，每星期可以賺四五十元，因此他們的輸血目的並不是賺錢，麥茂琳夫人自稱在二百决輸血中，除必需的旅行費用外，牠從沒有收過一個銅板的直接報酬。牠曾慷慨地說：『賺人之錢是極不應該的事。』這種慈悲為懷，捨己為人的崇高的犧牲眞是値得大書特書加以頌揚的。</p>
<p>社會</p>
<h3>生活的藩籬</h3>
<p>— 于飛</p>
<p>人從娘胎裏出來，便開始生活。雖然有些人正在閉着眼睛說，這個國度里並沒有階級之分，然而畢竟還有貧富貴賤之別。因此，初生的嬰孩，有的躺在高等產科醫院的白色搖床上，有的却睡在矮小簡陋的茅棚里；吮吸的乳漿，呼吸的空氣——一個人生活的開始，便已經有所軒輊了。</p>
<p>富人的生活，是吃的好，穿的好。飽暖之外，便是淫慾。因為是「淫慾一，於是有妓女，嚮導女舞女歌女男妓等等的產生。加强刺激的有爵士音樂，輪盤賭，回力球，跑馬跑狗，裸體表演，「民間電影…物價漲了，富人們的「生活　目的是恣情的消費，所以更顯得豪闊；而他們的錢呢，雖然並非從臍帶上帶來，却照樣從別的地方源源而來。</p>
<p>窮人的生活，是一天做到晚，一年做到頭；工人每天掙到的錢只夠吃大餅，不夠買米吃；農民還去租米完過糧白，只剩下一個飢餓的肚皮。他們生下的小孩子，只有送給育嬰堂或丟在路旁，生了病沒法延醫服藥，死了人只有睡慈善餓佈賜的白板棺材。勞働，飢餓，貧窮，疾病，死亡…一切祥的名字，貫串着他們的生活</p>
<p>這樣二種絕然不同的生活，是有社會制度作了藩籬間隔着。同時，也倚靠了這種社會制度，把兩種生活連結着。可是，人畢竟有生活向上的慾望；因此，富人要維持富裕的生活，窮人要打破貧困的生活。化為現象，不免形形色色：富人們說：「人之窮富，繫於命運。」窮人們信以為眞，便開始憎恨命運。富人們又說：「努力上進，運道一來，窮人也成富人！」窮人們於是相信命運，努力「向上爬」；其實上了大當，奴隸將要做定。爬，爬，爬，碰了釘子跌下來，摸模額上的疙瘩，只好又嗟怨命運。跌過幾决，也許跌得漸漸明白起來：不拆除社會制度這座藩籬，總是爬不過去的。</p>
<p>我們的藩籬，還交織着帝國主義與封建勢力。要拆，便得向這兩種勢力爭。</p>
<h3>易做的事</h3>
<p>— 吳積圻譯</p>
<p>一個靑年寫信給我，要我給他找個容易做的職位。於是，我回答說：「你不能做編者；不要從事法律；別想做大員；不要經商；叉應當討厭政治學；不耍當醫生；不要做農夫，兵士，或是水手；更不要讀；又不要想。孩子呀，你巳經踏進了這艱困的現實了，沒有一樣是容易的。我知道世界上只有一個地方是安樂無比的，那就是墳墓。」（H．W．Beecher却酬）</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小靑著</p>
<p>第八章　捉住了兩個人</p>
<p>霍桑又把身子靠着椅背，兩手抱着右滕，停著目光，深思似地答道：「還難，也許有的。因為這李守琦最近又到過上海，和麗蘭談過一談。這回事你可知道嗎？」</p>
<p>安娜搖頭道：「不知道。他幾時來的？」</p>
<p>「前大十七日中飯時到的，在麗蘭家裹住了一夜，據說是昨天十八日一淸早回蘇州的。」</p>
<p>「有這事？麗蘭怎麼不告訴我？」</p>
<p>霍桑又問道：「你在什麼時候最後瞧見麗蘭？」</p>
<p>安娜立卽答道：「昨天下午——兩點鐘光景，我到伊家裏去，邀伊去看明星照片展覽會，伊不答應。那時伊不曾提起這件事。」</p>
<p>「伊可曾對你說什麼話，或有什麼異常的表示？」</p>
<p>「我覺得伊好像有什麼心事。伊躺在沙發上吸紙烟，告訴我有些頭痛，說話也不多。我也曾問過伊，伊不說什麼。所以我不曾坐定，就回出來。」</p>
<p>霍桑點了點頭，放下了右腿，立起來說道：「姜小姐，這件事很複雜，案子裏嫌疑的人很多，現在我澴決不定是誰。我總盡我的力，如果能够解決，我馬上會通知你。」</p>
<p>姜安娜也領會到霍桑巳有送客的意思，便也把擱在膝上</p>
<p>的藍皮手夾拿在手裹，盈盈地站起來。「好，謝謝霍先生。」</p>
<p>伊又向我們點點頭，正耍回身走出門口，霍桑喚住伊。</p>
<p>他道：「「姜小姐，還有一句話。你可知道麗　的錢，有那幾個來源？」</p>
<p>姜安娜停了脚步，呆了一呆，「錢的來源？自然是陸經理啊。我知道小余是不會化錢的，蘭反而常給他做衣服。那個姓趙的也不像有錢。」</p>
<p>霍桑點點頭。「好，我知道了。再會。」</p>
<p>姜安娜咯咯的皮鞋聲剛才走出大門，我還來不及開口跟霍桑討論這新發展的案情，那施桂忽又領進了兩個人來。一個是倪金壽的助手許三，後面一個就是余甘棠。（一二七）</p>

<p>㳺藝界</p>
<h3>脫離影壇後的秀蘭鄧波兒</h3>
<p>— 清暉</p>
<p>多年來，獨覇影壇的秀蘭鄧波兒，終於和我們告別了。許多人在懷念，並且急於要知道她晚離影界後的生活，現在，根據外國報章雜誌的記載，的略介紹如下：</p>
<p>逗人敬愛</p>
<p>在外表上，秀　變得很有限，還是那麼捲曲的頭髪，不過梳得比較整齊，兩顆烏溜溜的眼珠，深深的酒渦，臉龐圓緻得和蘋果一樣，依然是一個逗人愛的孩子，又和氣，又有趣，流露童眞的活潑。在學校裹，秀蘭有一個小小的困難，就是她底財富無形中使她與別的兒童隔離。她學了他們的樣子，穿了和他們一樣的衣服，才能混在他們一淘裏玩耍，但是仍然常在不知不覺中被發現她和他們間階級立　的不同，秀蘭為此很苦。她對於各種戶外運動頗感興趣，允其是排球；圖書室時常有她的踪跡，最愛閱的是名人傳記和軼事；在全班中，攻讀甚勤，成積雖不驚人，但她底法文和歷史兩門都很優越。她並且是一位老練的演說家，在短短數月中，巳經獲得過兩决演說競賽的優勝獎。</p>
<p>請客大王</p>
<p>秀蘭氣量很大，她和同學一起玩的時候，東道主總是她做的，所以她在同伴裏面，有請客大王」之譽。她常常請幾位同學到家裏來，開一小小的茶話會，有時也響亮地讚書，或打排球，熱大去游泳。</p>
<p>她畢竟是個出類拔萃的神童，當她在上課時，　聽着先生的講解；可是課恢，她會蹲在先生底旁邊，靜坐數小時之久，默無一語，有時　同散步至曠地，在小溝上架一肩小橋，或是做些孩子氣的玩意兒，甚至在老師身上搥幾下，而老師却並不感到厭惡的。</p>
<p>她常常疊着腿，一邊嚼着餅餌，一邊講述他旅行的生活，給同學們聽，她底經騐比一個普通成人還要豐富，最令人稱奇的是一切在她看來平淡無奇。她以為家庭是全球最可貴的地方。與國土並肩漫步談笑也不及雜在頑童　裏頑一頓的有趣。秀蘭晚離後的影壇，許多人想乘機刦奪她地位，但是和范倫鐵諾一樣，他底典型是沒有第二個人能够充飾的。她雖然告別影壇，可是從全球各地寄來的信件，却未見减少。足徵觀　對於她摯愛的熱烈。</p>
<h3>白楊主演「青年中國」</h3>
<p>— 海星</p>
<p>孤島的靑年在　綫，後方，和祖國的腹心，戰鬥了三年！這寫起來應該是一首慷慨激昂的雄歌。劇作家陽翰笙希望以電影來反映這一事實，已寫成一靑年中國」電影劇本，現由中國製片廠蘇怡導演，白楊，魏鶴齡，陶余，主演。由孤島大堂的攝影師央蔚雲担任拍攝。</p>
<p>白楊本來在「中央一的「長空萬里」中担任主角的，因長空萬里借一中國一郊外攝影　拍攝，內景尙正趕搭，故白楊在「靑年中國　裏的外景工作業已先行開始，預計四個月拍完。</p>
<p>「靑年中國是一曲雄歌，一首史詩，更是靑年人的一面明鏡！告訴你；「中國，是靑年的中國」這句話的眞理！</p>

<p>卡爾登邀聘尙和玉</p>
<p>移風社社長麒鱗實遵醫囑決定繼續靜養，因此卡爾登重演之日，叉將遙遙無期，卡爾登當局為維持後台班底生活計，曾擬請黃桂秋或張翼鵬暫時過渡，旋都以故未成，茲悉巳託人邀聘尙和玉南下，短期出演，按尙為皮黃劇壇之一代老伶工，應武生，擅短打戲，與故楊小樓被稱雙絕，雖巳年邁，而腰腿尙健，年來輒與時慧寳蕭長華程繼仙等以「五老會」標幟，重現舞台，仍獲美譽。聞尙何玉所索代價為八千元，目下正在談判中，如成事實，將另帶生旦各一人，鬚生或為管紹華，至於移風社之高百歲王熙春，則於此短期內暫行休息耳。</p>

<h3>Responding to the New Far East Environment: British Government Decides to Actively Assist China; Churchill Gives Assurance to Ambassador Quo Tai-chi; Burma Road Permitted to Reopen as Scheduled</h3>
<p>London – Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Quo Tai-chi, was invited by Prime Minister Churchill to visit last night. It is reported that a full review of the Burma Road issue was conducted. It is widely expected that an official statement regarding the British decision will be issued soon. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London – Since the British government reorganized yesterday, Prime Minister Churchill's initial expression of his political stance was to meet with Chinese Ambassador Quo Tai-chi. It is widely believed that Mr. Churchill revealed to the ambassador that Britain is prepared to open the Yunnan-Burma Road after October 18. The Chinese Ambassador also inquired, "Britain will also provide China with expanded economic assistance," and criticized America's recent loans to China as an expression of that country's foreign policy, and that Britain might also follow suit so as not to be outdone by the United States. Authoritative sources within the government here believe that former Prime Minister Chamberlain's appeasement policy towards Germany and Italy has failed. If Japan is appeased again, the extent of the failure will be no less than that towards Germany and Italy. The government here believes that Japan's dispatch of troops to Annam and occupation of naval and air bases there, and the formation of an alliance with the Rome-Berlin Axis countries all indicate that a new policy must be adopted to cope with the new environment. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington – US Secretary of State Hull solemnly declared yesterday that the United States opposes the closure of the Yunnan-Burma Road because it is an important international trade route. When asked to comment on reports that Britain is preparing to reopen the Yunnan-Burma Road when the Anglo-Japanese agreement expires on the 17th of this month, Hull made the above declaration. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – According to responsible sources, the British reopening of the Burma Road on October 17 is practically guaranteed at this point. Chinese transportation authorities are now stepping up preparations to cope with transportation issues once the road is open. The major problem that the authorities believe must be addressed is that Japanese aircraft will inevitably take off daily from their new bases in Vietnam to bomb and strafe the road. However, it is pointed out that this Japanese air raid will not seriously hinder traffic on the road. Even under heavy Japanese air raids, Chinese vehicles traveling along the Vietnam highway through Zhennanguan have continued to operate without interruption. Moreover, the situation of the Burma Road is different from that of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, which cannot be severely damaged by bombing. Since its completion, the Burma Road has not been widely used. Due to the shorter route and fuel savings, most Chinese transportation has taken the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and Highway. Since the Japanese army occupied Vietnam, the Chinese side must now use the Burma Road as a main route for imports and exports. Chinese transportation authorities are currently busy mobilizing and organizing large convoys of trucks and livestock to cope with the heavy cargo traffic after the road reopens on October 17. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Maintaining Interests in the Far East: Talks Between the US and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Washington – The attitude of the United States towards the Soviet Union's reaction to the pact of Germany, Italy, and Japan has attracted special and widespread attention here, because the Soviet Union and Japan are hereditary enemies in the Far East, and their interests currently coincide with those of the United States. US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt, has held discussions with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Strengthening Defense to Cope with the Crisis: Hong Kong is Fully Prepared</p>
<p>Hong Kong – A telegram sent today by the British Minister of Aircraft Production, Beaverbrook, is highly valued here. Mr. Beaverbrook telegraphed, "The British people should repay those Englishmen in China who have done their best." Local circles believe that this telegram is completely consistent with the attitude taken by Prime Minister Churchill yesterday after the cabinet reshuffle when he met with Chinese Ambassador Quo Tai-chi. Judging from recent news from London, this situation clearly indicates that Britain no longer intends to continue its appeasement policy towards Japan. Currently, Hong Kong has increased its preparations, air-raid shelters have been built everywhere, and the Evacuation Committee has rejected many requests for exemption from departure. According to the authorities, "The possibility of increasing evacuation ships to Australia is currently being considered." (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Soviet Statement: Unwilling to Divide Spheres of Influence in China with Japan</p>
<p>Moscow – "The Soviet Union has never declared its willingness to conclude a non-aggression pact with Japan on the condition of dividing spheres of influence in China." This definitive statement was issued by Moscow in response to a question from a Reuters reporter, and stated that the Soviet Union maintains a good-neighborly policy. If Japan has good intentions, it is not impossible for the Soviet Union to approach Japan. This point has been explained by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov in August. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Japan Threatens War: Still Attempting to Adjust Relations with the US</p>
<p>Tokyo – Semi-official sources say Japanese Prime Minister Konoe recently announced that Japan is prepared to adjust its relations with the US and the Soviet Union. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma recently said that the purpose of the German-Italian-Japanese alliance is to build a new order in Europe and Asia, not to promote victory in the war. Suma also pointed out the danger of the United States helping Britain participate in the war. If a third country outside the Allied countries participates in the war to help Britain, the Japanese navy in the West Pacific will assist the Axis powers in combat. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Some Japanese newspapers today hinted that if the United States and Britain do not openly oppose Japan because of the Tripartite Pact, there is still hope for maintaining friendly relations between Japan and those two countries. However, the "Kokumin Shimbun" took the opposite stance, warning that Japan might participate in the European war. The primary pressure exerted by Britain and the United States on Japan is the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road. The newspaper said, "The United States is obviously the instigator behind this evil drama. Britain's anti-Japanese performance is due to its setbacks in Europe." The "Kokumin Shimbun" continued, "Although the withdrawal of Japanese residents from London does not mean that Japan will immediately join the European war, Britain should know that the reason for the Japanese withdrawal is not because of difficulties in living and conducting business there." However, the "Chugai Shimbun" stated that unless Britain and the United States openly express various suspicions about the Tripartite Pact or take unfavorable actions against Japan, Japan will continue to maintain friendly relations with them. The "Chugai Shimbun" also emphasized that Japan should closely monitor the future actions of Britain and the United States. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>British Press Comments on Japan's Policy: Moving Towards a Reckless and Destructive Path</p>
<p>London – An editorial in "The Times" discusses Japan's role in the German-Italian-Japanese alliance: The goals of Nazi diplomacy are very clear, but it is difficult to understand what Japan hopes to gain from the new alliance. Japanese politicians naturally argue that if Germany defeats Britain and uses the threat of interfering in American affairs to prevent the United States from mobilizing, Japan will be the undisputed master of the Pacific. Those who insist on their own views will inevitably believe that Germany's strength is sufficient to achieve this result. Let us assume that this belief is correct, but Japan has already obtained all the benefits it can from the European war. Germany has exhausted its greatest efforts to defeat Britain and soften the United States. In addition, Germany cannot do anything else to please Japan. The current tripartite alliance does not increase Germany's capabilities or strengthen its military efforts; it only causes Japan to pursue interests that even the most short-sighted know are empty, and invites incalculable future consequences. Japan's situation in Asia is similar to Germany's in Europe. If it had adopted a path of peaceful cooperation, it could have occupied a prominent and respected position in China's economic development. Instead, it imitated Germany, lacking the necessary self-confidence and self-control for this task, and fell into a reckless and destructive path. Britain and the United States have repeatedly tried to establish a sympathetic understanding of Japan's needs, but Japan regarded this as a sign of weakness and used their concessions as a starting point for continued aggression. Japan's actions over the past three years have often deliberately provoked Western countries. Now, by joining an alliance with the Axis powers, it must be recognized that this is the last step in Japan's advance. Japan's foreign policy has always been known for its prudence, but now it has abandoned it, which is truly regrettable. One country that expresses happiness upon hearing of this alliance is China, because its far-sighted rulers are confident that Japan's deliberate provocation of hostility from Britain and the United States is tantamount to selling its future and suffering the consequences of Germany's failure. (Reuters)</p>
<p>China Has Not Yet Taken Steps to Recall Ambassadors to Germany and France</p>
<p>Chongqing – Reuters learned from responsible sources that the National Government has not yet taken steps to recall the Chinese ambassadors to Germany and France, and the chargé d'affaires in Italy. However, there is much speculation about whether China will take any action after Britain reopens the Burma Road. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>From Rice Prices to Rice Hoarding</h3>
<p>Recently, the highest grade of white polished rice has sold for as high as 95 or 96 yuan, an unprecedented price. Although this is the price of a very small quantity of rice and cannot be considered a benchmark, other rice prices have been driven up as a result. This newspaper has long been aware of this and has consistently advocated that domestic and imported rice should be valued equally to avoid the situation where one rises in response to the other. Unfortunately, this evaluation work has not been able to proceed as usual, allowing rice market speculation to run rampant, with high prices emerging from under the table one after another, leading to today's extraordinary prices. Rice merchants and hoarders are, of course, complacent and satisfied, with huge profits in hand and smiles on their faces, not thinking about the countless people in the sea of humanity who are crying in ragged clothes, unable to even get a bowl of porridge. How many such people are there, one wonders. Some explain it away by saying that if domestic rice is expensive, one can eat imported rice; if imported rice is expensive, one can eat mung beans. But what if mung beans are also expensive? I have seen men, women, and children waiting for the government to sell rice at reduced prices, getting up before dawn and not being able to redeem their ration until midday. They can only buy enough rice for a day's hunger. Yet they stand shoulder to shoulder, like geese in formation, and are whipped if they are not careful. Why must they endure such misery and abuse? It is because what they earned in the past was more than enough to maintain their past lives, but what they earn today is not enough to maintain their current lives. All of this is due to the hoarders with resources and the rice merchants who manipulate the market. Without hoarders, rice prices would never rise without falling; without manipulation, rice, even if expensive, would not be so expensive. Moreover, hoarding rice today is not easy. A bag of imported rice costs over 90 yuan, and a bag of polished rice costs over 120 yuan. A hundred bags would cost more than ten thousand gold, let alone the thousands or tens of thousands of bags that are hoarded. Therefore, without hundreds of thousands or millions of yuan, one cannot even begin; without power, one would not dare to hoard. Hoarding and manipulating the people's food supply is not only severely punished by law but also cracked down on by municipal authorities. Yet, those who dare to commit this great wrong must have something to rely on, something to pretend to, something to collude with. There is something that neither the law can sanction nor public opinion can move. Only then do they dare to act boldly, dare to profit from the people's food, and dare to oppress the masses. As a result, there must be many hoarders, but who they are has not been revealed. It is not that there are no people [to investigate], but like city foxes and shrine rats, they have something to rely on; it is not that there is no punishment, but they are hesitant to strike, fearing repercussions. Thus, the momentum of rising rice prices is unmatched. This is not an empty statement to scare the world. Let's take second-grade white polished rice as an example. The average price in the 25th year of the Republic was 9.90 yuan, 11.90 yuan in the 26th year, and 12.10 yuan in the 27th year. Even during the three years of war, rice prices were still relatively stable. In the 28th year, speculation in all goods yielded huge profits, so speculators returned to the rice market. In that year, from January to July, the rice price rose from 11.50 yuan to 19.30 yuan, which was still not considered high. After August, prices rose monthly, reaching 38.80 yuan. By this year, from a rice price of just over 38 yuan, it has risen to over 90 yuan in October, nine times the rice price in the year the Shanghai War broke out. Even converted to British pounds, the value in the 25th year was 145 pence, but now, even using the lowest estimate of 1.5 pence (in reality, it is more), it is 315 pence, more than double the value. Therefore, the rise in rice prices has occurred in the past year. How could rice prices have suddenly risen so high in this one year? Apart from hoarding and speculation, there is no other explanation. At the beginning of the lunar year, there were many rumors in the rice market that rice prices would reach at least 100 yuan, so the rice price rose directly. Afterwards, there were some curves and twists, but the price of 100 yuan is now imminent. It cannot be said that this is not a premeditated action by rice merchants to create this high price. Even if they offer a hundred excuses, what can they say? I recall that in the 18th year of the Republic, the highest unofficial rice price reached 23 yuan. At that time, public opinion was very critical, but compared to today, it is like a minor wizard in the presence of a major wizard! Hoarding cannot be eliminated completely. Hoarding can also be a way to store food for the people, so saying that all hoarding should be punished is not a balanced or fair argument. However, hoarding that only aims to make a profit is, after all, the nature of a for-profit business and is not enough to be considered a hoarding disease. After all, seeking profit from capital and accumulating wealth is the norm and a reasonable plan. However, hoarding that endangers the people's food supply and disregards the public's livelihood, only caring about the enrichment of private interests, is punishable and unforgivable! It is well known that today's unscrupulous merchants dare to commit wrongdoing because they have many escape routes. If they are unsuccessful here, they can be successful elsewhere! However, unscrupulous merchants are still human beings. People know that it is pitiful to mistreat animals and want to treat them with humanity. But do they not think about treating people with humanity? If one can treat people with humanity, then unscrupulous merchants will also know that they cannot go beyond human reason and law, and will eventually know what to fear and what not to dare to do. However, if they are stubborn and unyielding, where is their conscience? Then, only by giving them a profound lesson can their stubborn minds be awakened. Therefore, the measures that should be taken against hoarders in the future are a crucial plan for stabilizing the Shanghai people's food supply today.</p>
<p>As for how to continue the evaluation work and how to devise ways to adjust the people's food supply in the future, I believe that what is urgent today is to take practical action, not to issue official statements. Use one point of energy to achieve one point of success. If one is truly concerned about the people's suffering and feels their pain in one's embrace, and deeply understands that the security of the Shanghai concession is closely linked to the safety of the people's food supply, how can one not act quickly and decisively and seek only to solve the people's food problem?</p>

<h3>Japanese Aircraft Bomb Chengdu: Heavy Damage to Tombs and Forests; Air Raid Alert in Chongqing as Well</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Today, Japanese aircraft bombed Chengdu, causing only heavy damage to tombs and forests. A large fire was still burning four hours after the bombing. At the same time, there was an air raid alert in Chongqing, but the Japanese aircraft did not arrive. The entire city's residents took shelter underground, lasting for four hours and a half, only coming out at 2 pm. According to well-informed sources, the purpose of the Japanese air raid was to scout out newly added bases of the Chinese Air Force, hoping to cause damage, but this time it clearly failed to achieve its goal. Also, Shantay (transliteration), 80 miles northeast of Chengdu, and Liangshan (transliteration), 100 miles northeast of Chongqing, were also heavily bombed. (United Press, 4th)</p>

<h3>Chinese Army Attacks Near Kowloon</h3>
<p>Chongqing – A spokesman for the Military Commission recently told reporters that the Japanese army near the border of Kowloon, Hong Kong, has recently been transferred to the Vietnamese border to reinforce, resulting in a depleted force. The Chinese army has taken the opportunity to attack. In addition, all fronts are extremely quiet. The Japanese army is still on the defensive, and the Chinese army has not yet begun a large-scale offensive. It has been learned that the Japanese army in the Vietnamese border area includes the 5th and 28th Divisions, which were transferred from Guangxi Province. At the same time, the 110th Division was transferred from Shanxi Province to Guangxi for defense. The Japanese army launched two attacks in Conghua and Huaxian in Guangdong Province, but were repelled. In addition, the Japanese army is concentrating in Central China, so a large-scale counterattack by the Chinese army near Yichang is quite possible. (Havas News Agency, 3rd)</p>

<h3>Brenner Pass: Meeting of German and Italian Leaders, Foreign Ministers of Both Countries Also Participate in Talks, African Military Affairs at the Center of Discussion</h3>
<p>Brenner, today at 11:00 AM, Hitler arrived by special train at Brenner Town, the Italian border. The station was adorned with German and Italian flags. As Hitler's train entered the station, an Italian military band played the national anthems of both countries. Mussolini was already waiting on the platform. They shook hands and exchanged greetings, then together reviewed the Italian Alpine troops and Fascist Party soldiers. Afterward, they proceeded to Mussolini's dining car on the platform and began their meeting. The foreign ministers of both Germany and Italy participated in the discussions. Those accompanying Hitler included General Keitel and Information Minister Dietrich. Accompanying Mussolini were Cabinet Secretary-General Sebastiani and Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Anfuso. The German Ambassador to Italy, Mackensen, and the Italian Ambassador to Germany, Alfieri, were also in Brenner. (Haitong Telegraph, 4th)</p>
<p>Rome: Officials here are maintaining strict secrecy regarding the content of the meeting between German Führer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini at the Brenner Pass. (Haitong Telegraph, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin: German officials recently gave a statement to foreign journalists here, explaining the recent meeting (the sixth) between the German Führer and the Italian Prime Minister, saying, "The Führer must have had a reason to meet with the Italian Prime Minister, and it always produces results. Although the results may not be immediately recognized, they will soon be recognized by all." When Hitler and Mussolini met in July, some countries were already showing signs of wavering. Regarding the journalists' inquiry as to whether the Brenner meeting would establish an agreement, the spokesperson only said that the results of the Brenner meeting were not convenient to announce at this time. As for whether Italian Interior Minister Sunar's continued stay in Rome was related to the Brenner meeting, the spokesperson said he did not know. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Brenner: The secret meeting between Hitler and Mussolini in Mussolini's dining car lasted three hours before concluding. Mussolini accompanied Hitler to his special train and bid him farewell with great warmth. Hitler's special train departed from the Brenner station at half past noon. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Rome: Today, the two dictators of Germany and Italy continued their discussions on the Axis powers' plans (the discussion began at 11:00 AM). Above the Brenner Pass, several fighter planes circled and patrolled. It is said that the atmosphere during the meeting between the two leaders at the station was extremely harmonious. The station was filled with German and Italian flags and decorated with flowers. The meeting ended at 1:50 PM. A communiqué was issued as follows: "Within the scope of a routine exchange of views, the Italian Prime Minister and the German Führer met at the Brenner Pass in the spirit of the Axis powers and had cordial talks. The two leaders, in the presence of their foreign ministers, jointly studied various issues related to the two countries for three hours. General Keitel also attended the second half of the talks." Before Hitler and Mussolini shook hands and bid farewell, they reviewed a detachment of Italian troops. At 2:40 PM, they boarded their trains and left the Brenner Pass. The Italian Prime Minister and Ciano also boarded their trains and departed five minutes later. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>New York: According to news received here, Hitler and Mussolini will hold an important meeting today. It is reported that the leaders of the two Axis powers are already en route to the meeting location. This news has sparked various speculations, including the possibility that they are considering the issue of joint military operations in Africa this winter. A diplomatic correspondent for Reuters in London commented that recent political and diplomatic developments have shifted attention to the military situation in the Middle East, as it appears that the Middle East situation will soon become a decisive factor in the war. General Graziani, commander-in-chief of the Italian forces in North Africa, is aware of the great risks Italy is taking, so he is advancing slowly, cautiously, and in an orderly manner. The task he undertakes is extremely difficult because he must not only deal with the problem of transporting troops, food, water, and weapons across the desert, but his lines of communication with Italy are also constantly threatened by the British fleet. The terrain of North Africa makes large-scale deployment of Italian forces impossible. Its rear lines of communication are very long and vulnerable to attacks from the air and sea. Although Germany may not be able to assist with a large number of dive bombers, the supply problem will still arise, and British Spitfire and Hurricane fighters cannot be underestimated. British aircraft have already effectively dealt with the threat of dive bombers in the Battle of Dunkirk. The deeper the Italian forces advance, the greater the difficulties they will encounter, while the strength of the British forces will continue to increase. This is another advantage for the British side. General Graziani's reluctance to advance lightly is well-founded. A rash advance is prone to failure, and failure would be fatal, because it would not only lead to the collapse of Abyssinia, which has been cut off from foreign aid, nor would it only ease the situation in Tunis, but it would also cause the Italian people, who were already unwilling to go to war and whose lives were becoming increasingly difficult, to be unable to bear this setback. Because the military issue in North Africa is so important, there are rumors that the Axis powers will temporarily hold back in Libya while seeking opportunities in the Balkans and Syria. However, there are many difficulties with this plan as well. If the Italian forces cannot achieve their ambitions in Libya, then unfavorable repercussions for the Axis powers will inevitably occur in the Balkans and the Far North. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin: German Führer Hitler, who rushed to the Brenner Pass, is expected to meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini this afternoon. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop also traveled on the second train. Both trains passed through Munich at midnight. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano will also participate in the Brenner Pass meeting. According to reliable sources, the focus of the meeting between the two leaders of Germany and Italy may be on Spain's signing of the Axis pact and the future reconciliation between Japan and the Soviet Union. The general public also believes that the rulers of these countries will discuss new military plans to coordinate German and Italian offensive operations in the African region, the Mediterranean region, and around the British Isles. (International Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Rome: According to unconfirmed reports last night, Prime Minister Mussolini has already left for the Brenner Pass to hold important talks with Führer Hitler. It is reported that during the meeting between the leaders of Germany and Italy, Article 5 of the Tripartite Pact will also be discussed, as that article had left room for determining the relationship between the Soviet Union and the Axis powers. It was suggested last night that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov be invited to attend the Brenner Pass meeting. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Führer Hitler suddenly left Berlin last night. It is rumored that Hitler plans to go to the Brenner Pass today to hold an important Axis powers meeting with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini or Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. It is reported that the main issues to be discussed by the two dictators are the relationship between the Soviet Union and Japan and Spain's formal participation in the totalitarian alliance. Ciano left Rome at 8:00 PM last night, but his destination was not disclosed. (International Telegram, 4th)</p>

<h3>Åland Islands Demilitarization, Soviet-Finnish Agreement Signed</h3>

<h3>British Warships Sink Italian Ship</h3>
<p>London: The Admiralty announced today that an Italian "Cortellazzo" class destroyer was sunk in the Adriatic Sea on September 22 by the British submarine HMS "Tetrarch" (1475 tons). This is the second victory for this submarine. On September 9, the submarine sank a 3,000-ton Italian supply ship in the Mediterranean Sea. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London: The Admiralty communiqué stated that in the past few weeks, British naval and air forces have destroyed seven German and two Italian submarines. Recent attacks by enemy submarines on merchant ships have been more successful than in the early stages of the war. This is not surprising as a result of Germany's occupation of French Atlantic ports after the collapse of France. Because German submarines can use the aforementioned ports as bases, they can operate at sea for a longer period of time than those departing from German ports. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>Another British National in Romania Kidnapped</h3>
<p>Bucharest: Another British national in Romania has been kidnapped. The man, named Clark, is in his sixties and runs an engineering firm in Ploiești. Last night, three young men in plainclothes broke into Clark's room in a hotel in Bucharest, forcibly abducted him, and his whereabouts are unknown. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Bucharest: British Minister to Romania, Sir Reginald Hoare, has sent another note to the Romanian government, demanding that Romania explain why it abruptly detained five British nationals, when the arrested British nationals could be released, or what crimes they had committed, and when the trial would be held. At the same time, Romanian police and the Iron Guard still deny any involvement in the arrest of Mr. Miller, a British national and manager of the Astra Romana oil company. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<h3>Italian-Spanish Negotiations Have Ended, Axis Powers' Goal is Military and Political Cooperation</h3>
<p>Rome: Yesterday, the main topics discussed during the press briefing here were the close cooperation between Spain and the Axis powers, Chamberlain's resignation, the political unrest in Britain, and the new Axis powers meeting predicted by Italian newspaper "Gazzetta del Popolo". According to officials, Spanish Interior Minister Serrano Súñer's long stay here was entirely Súñer's own idea. Yesterday, Súñer dined with Foreign Minister Ciano at the golf club. Súñer's formal negotiations in Rome have ended. According to political circles here, future political developments will take a different path. "Gazzetta del Popolo" stated in its editorial that the current goal of the Axis powers is cooperation in military and political plans. Germany and Italy are not in a hurry to end the war, but are determined to achieve final victory to reorganize Europe and Africa. Therefore, the meeting between the leaders of the two countries must be to discuss this issue. The actions of the Axis powers are often unexpected by Britain, such as Italy's attacks on Somaliland and Barani. Britain's cabinet changes are due to the increasing internal difficulties in Britain.

<h3>After Chamberlain's Retirement, the Appeasement Policy Ended, Two Representatives of the Working Class Joined the New Cabinet, Halifax to Become Leader of the Government Party in the House of Lords</h3>
<p>New York: Munich and all its sobering dreams and disappointing meanings have disappeared in the British government, and some new figures have joined the British government. The second major cabinet reshuffle in the British cabinet in the thirteen months since the outbreak of war between Britain and Germany has removed the last vestiges of the appeasement policy from the wartime cabinet led by Churchill. Chamberlain, who is thin and has gout, once believed that the agreement he signed with Hitler could ensure peace for Britain "in our time". Today, his political career and everything else has come to an end. The policy he advocated has now been formally rejected. But equally important as Chamberlain's departure is the promotion of two commoners to high positions. These two are representatives of the lower classes in London and have been on the front lines since the German army launched its blitzkrieg. One is Morrison, the current Minister of Home Security, and the other is Bevin, the Minister of Labour. No one is closer to the British government and the working class than these two. Bevin's joining the wartime cabinet will make the connection between Britain's production and combat closer. As far as Bevin is concerned, Britain can be very gratified to have this talent. As for the leaders of the combat part of the British cabinet, there have been no changes, which proves that Britain supports the continuation of the war and its current measures.

<p>London: Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax will become the Leader of the Government Party in the House of Lords, replacing Lord Caldecote, who has been transferred to Lord Chancellor. Downing Street announced that Labour Party Lord Snell will continue to serve as the Deputy Leader of the Government Party in the House of Lords to assist Lord Halifax. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London: It is reported that Sir Anderson has been appointed Privy Councilor to replace Chamberlain, and will take over all of Chamberlain's responsibilities, the most important of which is the guidance of the Main Committee, which is to publish various matters on the agenda of the War Cabinet according to their order of importance. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London: The cabinet personnel changes announced on Thursday have been unanimously welcomed by London newspapers, which say that Churchill's first government was hastily formed in special circumstances and should continue to be reorganized. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London: Newspapers here unanimously expressed a warm welcome to the cabinet changes announced on Thursday, but all newspapers also have a tendency to believe that Churchill's first government was formed hastily under the pressure of special circumstances, and then it is necessary to continue to suggest reorganization. Among the criticisms from London on this matter, there are two prominent characteristics: praise for Chamberlain and general satisfaction with Lord Cranborne's appointment as Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. The "Daily Herald" commented that although public trust in the main institutions of the government has never wavered, the time for change has indeed matured. In addition to urging further changes in government personnel, the newspaper also questioned why Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax had not been changed. Halifax's concessions to Japan have resulted in destruction, and his courtesy to Spain has only strengthened General Franco's respect for the Axis powers. Romania has now left us, and the Soviet Union has shown nothing but hostility to Halifax's requests. Anderson's transfer from the Interior is due to his inability to cope, but he has obtained a more responsible position (Lord President of the Council) as compensation. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>Wells Criticizes British Foreign Secretary</h3>
<p>New York: British writer H.G. Wells yesterday harshly criticized British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, saying that Halifax cannot represent the British people, holds anti-Soviet prejudices, and is not suitable for seeking peace. Wells said that Halifax is someone that all patriotic British people should avoid, and said that Halifax holds anti-Soviet religious prejudices and can never seek peace. To resolve the war, the Soviet Union is indispensable, because the Soviet Union loves peace and does not want to spend its resources on war.</p>
<h3>US President Schedules Speech, Involves US Defense Issues</h3>
<p>Washington: The White House announced yesterday that President Roosevelt will deliver a "non-political" speech in Dayton, Ohio, on the 12th of this month, which will only involve the topic of US defense and review the entire defense plan of Latin American countries.

<h3>Pacific Joint Defense, Britain and the United States Have Agreed on Principles, Totalitarian Countries Trying to Manipulate World Trade, US Experts are Studying Countermeasures</h3>
<p>A correspondent for the "Daily Mail" in London telegraphed the newspaper from Washington today, stating that representatives from Britain, the United States, and Australia have agreed on an agreement for joint action in the Pacific Ocean. When this action is implemented, there will not be much delay. It is said that the basic principles of the agreement are roughly that the US fleet will be responsible for the defense of the Pacific Ocean, while the British fleet will guard the Atlantic Ocean. The following four factors are very important: (1) If Britain cannot continue to effectively blockade the Atlantic Ocean and continue to control the Mediterranean Sea, then 400 million people in Europe will be ruled by Germany. (2) Japan may control 300 million people. (3) The Soviet Union will rule 200 million people. (4) The people of the German, Soviet, and Japanese political and business alliance reach 1 billion, while the United States and Canada have only 150 million.</p>
<p>Experts are now studying how to adjust US trade under the new threat of totalitarian countries. It is obvious that the United States' trade in Europe will decrease in the future. German and Italian machinery manufacturers in South America are now competing with countries in the Western Hemisphere. After the end of the European war, the supply of goods from Europe will be much cheaper than that from the United States. It is said that Germany will exchange its machinery for Brazilian coffee, Uruguayan meat, and Argentine wheat. Officials believe that if the United States wants to continue to dominate the Western Hemisphere, this issue must be resolved. (International News Agency, 4th)</p>
<h3>Japan and the Dutch East Indies are Negotiating, Now in a Delicate Stage, Horiuchi's Return to His Country is Postponed</h3>
<p>Tokyo: When Foreign Ministry spokesperson Suma met with news reporters today, he was asked if the talks with the Dutch East Indies had reached a delicate stage and if the Japanese representatives were now planning to break off the talks. When asked if this news was accurate, the spokesperson replied that the meeting was still in progress, but although the chief Japanese representative, Kobayashi, had spoken with the Dutch Governor-General when he arrived in Batavia, he has not yet participated in the meeting. When asked when the outgoing Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Horiuchi, would depart from Washington to return to his country, the spokesperson replied that the date has not been determined.

<h3>Air Defense Drills Held in Tokyo</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Today, air defense exercises entered an expanded phase. These exercises are different from ordinary ones and are obviously intended to impress the people with the fact that Japan is vulnerable to air raids. Because most Japanese houses are made of wood, special precautions should be taken. According to a communiqué issued by the Air Defense Exercise Headquarters, "Enemy air squadrons, each with eight or nine large bombers, flew south along the Pacific Ocean, then turned toward Japan and reached Tokyo, bombing fiercely for 30 minutes from 10:15 AM. Attention should be paid to railways, telegraphs, telephones, transportation, and broadcasting stations. Ground losses were quite heavy. During the '30-minute air raid,' all transportation in the affected area was suspended." (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<p>Male sexual health is the driving force of love... It is also the factor that beautifies life, the engine that creates the world...</p>
<p>Humans are emotional animals; humans are not unfeeling. Because of the function of emotion, families can prosper, societies can be formed, life can be beautified, and the world can be full of vitality, light, and continuous progress. If humans were without emotion, then there would be no family, friends, relatives... or other human relationships. Social organizations would crumble, and the world would be a cold and desolate place. Not only that, but people eating would be like taking medicine, men and women marrying would be like doing hard labor, and the human world would face the danger of extinction! Therefore, emotion is an indispensable thing for each of us.</p>
<p>Emotion is the expression of sex; sex is the foundation of emotion. The occurrence of emotion is entirely based on sex. Let's take love as an example. If a man has strong sexual function and marries a beautiful and graceful woman, the love between them will surely be passionate and abundant. It is truly a case of spiritual and physical harmony. They love each other, share meals, and spend their days in joy and happiness. In this situation, their spirits and bodies are completely integrated. What's yours is mine, and what's mine is yours. There is truly no distinction between us. When I comfort you, I comfort myself at the same time. Their love is so strong! At the same time, their children, the crystallization of their love, will surely be intelligent and clever. The families they form will surely be happy and sweet. Their lives will be so beautiful and joyful! If a man, due to early self-abuse and nocturnal emissions, or post-marital debauchery and overwork, suffers from spermatorrhea, seminal leakage, dissipated energy, neurasthenia, incomplete development, thin sperm, infertility, etc., then even if he has beautiful wives and concubines, he will be defeated in every sexual encounter. This will be a wake-up call to the man, and all will be lost. But for the partner who is full of passion and eager for comfort, how heartbroken she will be. As a result, love breaks down, and all kinds of tragedies are played out in families! On the man's side, it may even lead to premature aging and early death! Wise husbands who want to seek remedy, according to world-renowned doctors and my own experience, all agree that taking the gonadotropic hormone preparation "Reproduction Hormone" is the most effective treatment. This preparation is extracted from the gonads of strong animals such as apes and gorillas and reproduced using scientific methods. After taking it, it can produce sperm, nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, activate blood circulation, and nourish the nerves within a day and night. If you continue to take it, you will surely be able to completely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, and it can also have the effect of prolonging life and rejuvenating youth. However, those with spermatorrhea must also take "Hemet's Sperm-Locking Pills" to strengthen the seminal gate and stop spermatorrhea, so that both the root and the symptoms are treated, and the effect is even faster!</p>
<p>Healthy Beauty</p>
<h3>Breasts are the Messengers of Female Happiness</h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei</p>
<p>If unfortunately shriveled, seek scientific remedy quickly. The mystery and ingenuity of the Creator is beyond words. Look: If a young woman has a slender waist and plump buttocks but does not have a pair of high, soaring breasts in front, then the most beautiful curves of the female form cannot be created. How can she be mysteriously sensual and respected and admired everywhere? Therefore, world-renowned beauty experts and physiologists such as Kang Delin and gynecologist Tang Posheng have said this: If a woman's breasts are higher and more elastic, not only in terms of beauty can they form the most mysterious curves with the waist, making every man feel good, but also because of the health of their ovaries, the vigor of their metabolism, their temperaments are always open-minded and gentle, their muscles are always crystal clear and white, and their thoughts are always sharp and thorough. Even when faced with difficult problems, they can handle them analytically, without feeling overwhelmed. In addition, because of the smooth blood circulation, a peach blossom-like smile appears on their faces. Even without makeup, they are extremely beautiful. Although age increases, youth remains. Their sexual life is even more infinitely sweet, forming a happy and fulfilling family, and giving birth to healthy and lively children. Such women are truly happy and lovely! But in the past, due to self-abuse, breast binding, irregular menstruation, vaginal discharge and other symptoms, resulting in weakened ovarian function and affecting breast development, the only remedy is to take the ovarian preparation "Reproduction Hormone" for women as soon as possible. This can nourish ovarian function, invigorate metabolism, regulate menstruation, and</p>
<h3>The Latest Treatment for Spermatorrhea</h3>
<p>— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>One wrong step leads to eternal regret! This is a warning to young people during the onset of spring fever not to go astray due to weakness of will. Indeed, the youth stage of life is the period for laying the foundation for a bright and happy future. At this time, one should exercise the body and study academics to be able to shoulder important responsibilities in the future. However, although a few of today's young people are soberly striving, most are living in a drunken dream, passing their days in a muddle, controlled by the environment, unable to restrain their own sexual stimulation, and committing masturbation everywhere. Not knowing is not a crime, and we do not deeply hate them for this. The worst thing is that they do not realize their mistakes after masturbating, which deepens their bad habits and causes spermatorrhea. Because once there is spermatorrhea, not only cannot the semen in the body be stored, but there is also a danger of it being depleted! If the semen dries up, the brain, spinal cord, and sex nerves will all be severely affected. Symptoms such as weakened brainpower, headaches, forgetfulness, insomnia, back pain, seminal leakage, premature ejaculation, and impotence will follow. In addition, because developmental function is hindered, the sexual organs become small like a child's, the production of semen is insufficient, and sperm is lacking, resulting in thin sperm and infertility. Such young people will not only be unable to work hard in academics and careers, and their future will be bleak! Even in the marital life of procreation, they will often be unable to fulfill their duties completely, causing pain and regret for their wives, and creating family tragedies! Or they will have difficulty having children, leaving a lifelong regret! Wise young people who want to seek remedy should take "Hemet's Sperm-Locking Pills" as soon as possible to strengthen the seminal gate, calm the nerves, and reduce dreams, so that spermatorrhea can be cured. If the above symptoms have already been caused by spermatorrhea, then the gonadotropic hormone preparation "Reproduction Hormone" must also be taken to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase sperm and blood, and nourish the nerves, so that the above symptoms can be cured in a short period of time, and the body can become healthier. If patients can come to our clinic in person for diagnosis by expert physicians and receive the latest treatments such as electrotherapy, injections, and surgery, a cure can be guaranteed.</p>

<h3>London Weather Turns Bad, German Air Fleets Continue Raids, Random Bombing in the Thames Region, British Aircraft and Anti-Aircraft Teams Resist Fiercely</h3>
<p>London yesterday was the first overcast day since the beginning of autumn in Britain. German air forces continued to raid the British Isles, dropping bombs on cities such as London, with no specific targets. The bombing area was quite wide, including areas such as the Thames River basin in London, Canterbury, and Cornwall. However, material damage and casualties were minimal. The German side constantly sends single aircraft to raid, so the defenses in southeastern England and the counties near London are constantly on alert. However, most German aircraft are hidden above the dark clouds. The anti-aircraft teams are quite active, especially in eastern London. It is said that German aircraft fly over every few minutes and then leave after a while. However, the intensity of the anti-aircraft fire is no less than during a night raid. Just after noon, a train coming from Euston was strafed by German aircraft while passing through a small town in the Midlands, and three people were slightly injured. The train continued for a few miles before stopping. Seeing that the injured were not seriously injured, it drove to a large city, where the injured were taken to a hospital for treatment. The train's dining car was damaged by machine gun bullets. London issued three air raid warnings yesterday. The third one was issued in the afternoon and lasted the longest. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London. After experiencing several days of fierce bombing from the sky, London City once again exhausted its resistance last night, engaging with the raiding German aircraft. Yesterday's longest daylight air raid in London lasted four hours. Bombings spread across nine major districts in the British capital. Low-flying German aircraft attempted to repeat their past success, but were repeatedly repelled by the British side. German aircraft invading in the evening were finally driven back across the English Channel. German aircraft returned to Britain at night and bombed London and western England to some extent. (UPI)</p>
<p>London. The Air Ministry announced that the number of houses destroyed in the city of London was still being finalized, and casualties were not high. Elsewhere, bombs fell in the Thames River basin, Windsor. It, and Cornwall, but there was no major damage or casualties. A city and a small town in the Midlands were attacked, with slight casualties. Other than some destroyed houses, other damage was minor. One enemy aircraft was shot down near a town near London. Some residents of the town died or were seriously injured due to bombs and machine guns. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin. According to our sources, more than 100 German aircraft flew to London yesterday and dropped 150,000 kilograms of bombs. When the last team flew over the central capital, nine fires were seen. Several other groups of German aircraft bombed military targets near London. The air raid was still in progress until 8 p.m. last night. Air raid alarms were constantly issued in London from morning to night yesterday. (Haitong, 4th)</p>
<p>London. Today, German long-range guns on the French coast opened fire on a British convoy in the Strait of Dover. It is estimated that the guns from the Cape Gris-Nez fired two volleys of three shells each. However, the convoy continued to sail around the coast. Residents along the coast were awakened from their sleep, houses shook, and the sea surged high. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>German War Report</h3>
<p>Berlin. This afternoon's German war report stated that although the weather was bad yesterday, the German Air Force was still able to retaliate against British aircraft bombing German cities, heading to London and southern and central England to attack military targets. A gas company in northwestern London was hit and exploded, with black smoke billowing. German aircraft bravely attacked two major munitions factories near Coventry and Chester. Several halls and factory buildings were destroyed. Airfields near London and Cornwall were bombed by German aircraft. Aircraft parked underground were destroyed. German aircraft attacked trains and motor trucks north of London, achieving similar results. Compared with the actions of German aircraft, the actions of enemy aircraft were not only dwarfed during the day, but also invisible at night. Only one British aircraft attacked the industrial construction in western Germany, and only a few attacked the Norwegian coast. In total, the enemy lost three aircraft yesterday, and four German aircraft went missing. (Haitong, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin. According to military experts, a supplementary German war report stated that German aircraft have been bombing Britain for 25 consecutive days. London and southern and central England have been bombed. Fires broke out at London stations, the Thames River's seaports, and docks. Airfields throughout the area were also bombed by German aircraft. British destroyers did not resist much. German aircraft easily flew to the western and southern coasts of Britain. German aircraft low-altitude bombed an airfield, hitting a hangar. At that time, the German aircraft were only 100 meters high. German aircraft attacked the ports of Cowes, Weymouth, and Newhaven, with great success. Cowes Harbour is on the north shore of Cowes Bay in the Bristol Channel and has steel factories and oil refineries, which were hit by German aircraft, causing fires. At the ports of Newhaven and Weymouth in southern England, there were oil and gasoline depots that were bombed, causing explosions and bright lights. Weymouth is very close to Portland and is also a naval base. A German bomber hit a British cargo ship near the southwest coast of Ireland. The engine room was destroyed, and the cargo caught fire. The ship was almost sunk. German Navy Captain Jeni's submarines recently sank eight armed merchant ships, totaling 42,644 tons. The British ship "Highland Patriot" (14,000 tons) has also been sunk. On the evening of the 2nd, Britain attacked northern and southwestern Germany and the occupied areas, only destroying a factory that had been shut down for many months. Several British aircraft attempted to attack Berlin but were repelled by anti-aircraft teams. One of them was shot down north of Berlin, catching fire and being destroyed. German aircraft attacked various parts of Britain, and British aircraft did not engage much. Only six were lost the day before. The fighter squadron led by German Air Force Major Petersen has sunk 90,000 tons of enemy ships and destroyed 40,000 tons in the past six weeks. (Haitong, 5th)</p>
<h3>British Air Force Fiercely Attacks Hamburg Oil Factory, Dropping Bombs and Causing Large Fires</h3>
<p>London. In the past 24 hours, the British Air Force has engaged in extensive activities, attacking airfields and bases in Germany, Holland, Belgium, and France. Their special target was Hamburg. The large oil factories and storage depots there were fiercely bombed by batches of British heavy bombers for two hours. The first batch of British aircraft arrived in Hamburg at 10 p.m. and hit the targets, with four fires breaking out. The fires then spread and merged into one. The British aircraft that arrived later found the targets by the light of the fire and dropped high-explosive bombs on them. Soon another fire broke out. According to the Air Ministry's intelligence office, when the last British aircraft left the area to return to defense, it saw two places still ablaze, with thick smoke billowing and permeating the sky over the Elbe River. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London. The Air Ministry announced that during the day yesterday, the British Air Force bombed German bases that invaded Britain. Due to the bad weather, the action was quite limited, but the scheduled night bombing was cancelled due to the bad weather. British aircraft bombed ships near Dunkirk, a concentration of ships at the port of Rotterdam, and a factory near Chanze. British aircraft also attacked the Cherbourg railway line and oil depot. All British aircraft returned safely. After dark, the weather became increasingly bad. This morning, a German bomber was shot down by British fighter aircraft in the sea off the east coast.

<h3>Greece Mobilizes Troops to Strengthen Border Defenses</h3>
<p>Athens. Last night, after receiving reports that a large Italian army had concentrated on the Greek border, Greece immediately increased its troop deployment along the Greek-Albanian border to prepare for any eventuality. The situation here is now extremely tense, as there is deep fear that Italy will soon invade Greece. Italy had previously made territorial demands to the Athens government. If they were not granted, an act of aggression was inevitable. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<h3>Random Talks on the European War (18): A True Account of the British Air Raid on the Ruhr</h3>
<p>This article is a true account of a night raid on the Ruhr by a 27-year-old airman (the author's name is withheld for military reasons) and three companions in a twin-engine Hampden bomber in mid-July of this year. By July 11 of this year, the author had flown more than 30 bombing missions over Germany, not counting the number of times he flew over Germany to drop leaflets at the beginning of the war. The original article appeared in the American magazine Life, and is translated as follows:</p>
<p>At 6:00 p.m., I was summoned to headquarters to receive instructions for bombing a target in the Ruhr area of Germany. I had been to the Ruhr area many times before, and I could fly there with my eyes closed. Over the Hamm railway marshalling yard, my two brothers and I bombed a train full of ammunition heading from Hamburg to Essen. Cargo barges in the Ems Canal near Dortmund were also bombed by us. In addition, we bombed a factory in Duisburg.</p>
<p>Our targets were scattered everywhere. When we took off, it was already dusk. We made a final check of the loaded Hampden. Then we took off immediately. The night was as cool as water and crystal clear. I knew that the entire flight would be pleasant. Flying east, I gradually raised the fuselage to 15,000 feet. It was 11:00 p.m.</p>
<p>As usual, the machine gunners were talking on the "intercom." They were in the upper and lower gun rooms, Mike above and Bert below. During this long night flight, they talked about their football experiences for an hour. My bombardier, Taffy, was always muttering and complaining about the night sky. No matter how good the night sky was, he always had to complain. I shouted to him once on the intercom, and all I heard back were those indistinct sounds. I guessed that he must be eating his chocolate and oranges again, as was his custom during air raids.</p>
<p>We flew close to Holland and saw only a patch of black. The shallow sandy beaches merged with the sea. To the north, I could tell at a glance that it was the Heligoland Bight and the anti-aircraft fire and searchlights over "Wind Corner," which lit up the sky. Other British planes had already had fun at Kiel. We passed through Holland and headed straight for Duisburg.</p>
<p>A pile of clouds rose below 6,000 feet. The light of the searchlights shone through in front, a sea of bright and beautiful clouds. I was thinking that we would be safe above this cloud layer, when I suddenly heard Bert say to Mike from the lower gun room, "There are six fighters below... I think they are German Messerschmitts... they are rising quickly... hurry up." He could clearly see their black shadows from the bright clouds. Of course, the Germans could see us too. I tilted the fuselage so that Mike in the upper gun room could see where the enemy planes were and aim his machine gun.</p>
<p>English planes in the English Channel</p>
<p>Bert grumbled, "They're not flying over, the shameful things..." Mike got excited, as if the Germans could hear him: "Fly up, fly up, let's have a duel." But the German planes didn't fly over. They hid far away and disappeared.</p>
<p>At this time, many things came to my mind. We had flown to the Rhine River, and the fuselage was gradually descending like a light feather, passing through the clouds. The faint moonlight below highlighted our ground targets. I tilted the fuselage in vain and pulled the control stick back, and the fuselage rose again.</p>
<p>In a moment, I told my companions on the intercom that we were about to prepare for battle. I held back the control stick and pointed the nose straight down. After Taffy found the target, he told me to hold tight. We plunged straight down through the anti-aircraft fire. The altimeter was spinning like a top, 6,000 feet, 5,000 feet, 4,000 feet. The sound of the wind and the sharp sound of the engine echoed each other. Soon we were in the middle of the artillery fire. The roaring sound was frightening. The searchlight searching for the target shone directly outside the aircraft window, and anti-aircraft shells shot up like a string of beads. Short-range anti-aircraft shells passed through another target. Even without these signs, we could have reached our destination. As before, the Germans lit up the target we wanted. The whole of Duisburg was as bright as day with searchlights and flares. There was also a kind of luminous thing, shining brightly, floating in the air, like tinsel hanging on a Christmas tree, both extremely beautiful and extremely frightening. When we rose, we watched these luminous things for a while, soaring and spinning outside the circle of searchlights and the range of anti-aircraft fire.</p>
<p>The sky above and in front of the fuselage was filled with anti-aircraft fire. The sound of shells and bombs exploding was louder than the roar of our plane's engine. I understood why. Other British planes had already gone to drop bombs in the low place in front. Part of the factory building had been hit and was on fire. The German artillery and anti-aircraft guns were obviously busy dealing with other planes and had no time to pay attention to us. We circled outside the artillery fire and searchlights, waiting for the sound of the bombs to stop.</p>
<p>The explosions below our fuselage caused the fuselage to sway. Taffy always told me to hold the direction. "A little to the right... don't move. A little to the left... don't move." I followed what he said to keep the fuselage in balance. When I relaxed the control stick to the back, I dragged out the bomb selection lever, ready for Taffy to press the button.</p>
<p>In that instant, the searchlights on the ground were searching for us. I just focused my eyes on the instrument panel. Looking down through the small hole in the grille, I caught a glimpse of the silhouette of Taffy's head and back facing the bomb sight, which was made even clearer by the firelight shooting up from below. The fuselage suddenly floated up and vibrated, and I knew that the first batch of bombs had been dropped. At the same time, a cluster of anti-aircraft shells exploded below, almost hitting our backs. When the shells exploded, the fuselage swayed greatly, as if a person's head had been hit. I didn't know if the fuselage had been hit, I just put the fuselage back in a balanced position. The pointers and other instruments on the instrument panel were still jumping around, but the roar of the engine was still normal.</p>
<p>The machine gunners stared straight at the ground to see how our bombs were detonating. Although only one or two seconds passed, it seemed like minutes. Bert shouted from the intercom, "To the right." Taffy always felt that he couldn't aim perfectly - and he was afraid of being hit by anti-aircraft shells when he released the bombs. I slid through the anti-aircraft fire to avoid severe shocks, but the searchlight was always firmly fixed on us. Fortunately, we weren't hit by gunfire, and in a moment the searchlight lost its position.</p>
<p>After turning a corner, I started flying over the target again, trying to get an extra accurate position. After Taffy aimed, we were back in the center of the anti-aircraft fire. Flares rose to the left and right of the fuselage, and the green flames illuminated the cockpit brightly. There was an explosion on the port side, and the intercom to the bombardier was blown up. I could only keep the fuselage balanced and motionless according to the last aimed position. This time we could clearly see the target on the ground. I even saw the flames in the factory building coming out from between the rafters.</p>
<p>When the second batch of bombs was dropped, the fuselage vibrated and floated upward again. I tilted the fuselage and looked down. At this time, the searchlights either couldn't shine on us or had been extinguished. I could hear Bert and Mike chattering away on the intercom. This time the bombs that were dropped were not in vain. I saw everything in chaos for a few seconds, and I didn't know how I flew later. I didn't understand if there were any other actions. I notified the rest of the crew on the intercom and asked them to prepare to escape by parachute, but my throat was hot and my lips were dry, so I could only say a few words softly. They didn't hear me - in fact, they couldn't have survived if they jumped down in such a high altitude.</p>
<p>Gradually everything returned to normal. Taffy was able to speak on the intercom. He was surrounded by gunfire and injured. When the fuselage turned, there was almost a big mess. The two machine gunners were fine, but they had a bump on their foreheads. The Hampden bomber is not as agile and can turn around as freely as a fighter. Taffy was still very calm, and in a moment he was mumbling again, asking if I was going to fly to the Essen area to find the target of the marshalling yard. I told Taffy to come up first and fix the lights on the instrument panel, because I couldn't grope around in the dark while sitting in the driver's seat. After the lights were restored, we set off for the railway station.</p>
<p>It was now 1:00 a.m. We had only stayed over Duisburg for about an hour, but it felt like a year had passed. The engine was smoothly encouraging us to fly over the Essen area. The searchlights shot up again, sometimes shining on us, sometimes not. On the way to Hamm and Dortmund, the anti-aircraft fire on the Ems Canal was very fierce. We crossed the fire net and moved forward. Mike and Bert talked all the way, talking about their salmon fishing in Scotland.</p>
<p>In a moment, the railway station was in front of us. I looked down and saw many trains full of goods gathered at an intersection. Looking down from 4,000 feet, everything was clear at a glance. The anti-aircraft guns were booming upwards again, and I couldn't care about anything at this time. I plunged straight down through the fire net. I dragged the bomb selection lever over again, ready to drop the last batch of bombs. After Taffy aimed, the last batch of bombs was dropped in a moment. They hit the target, exploding at the railway intersection and on top of a train.</p>
<p>Our plane descended straight down, turning around, until it was 300 feet off the ground, carefully looking at the damage on the ground. The small house at the railway station was on fire, the rails were cracked, and when we flew over, some of the rails had flown into the air, and anti-aircraft shells flew towards us again. I pulled the control stick hard, but this time it was not as dangerous as it was over Duisburg. After we bombed Duisburg twice to get an accurate target, we had no more bombs to drop in the Dortmund area, so we opened up the speed and flew back to our country. (End)</p>

<h3>The Yunnan-Burma Road Will Be Opened Soon; Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union Actively Assist China; the Cooperation is Further Facilitated by the Alliance of Three Nations; the United States Continues to Lend China Huge Sums to Support the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>Two Authoritative Foreigners Analyze the Latest International Situation</p>
<p>A reporter from New Voice News Agency visited a certain foreign observer at his residence on Connaught Road yesterday to discuss the situation in Europe and Asia. When he talked about the alliance of three nations, he smiled and said to the reporter that the alliance of three nations has no other effect except to give Japan a heavy responsibility. Judging from its motives, it seems to be intimidating Britain and the United States, but Britain and the United States will cooperate more as a result, and the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union will also tend to improve. Germany had previously threatened to cross the English Channel and attack Britain directly, but due to its naval inferiority, it could not move forward. Then it used a large-scale air raid strategy to try to destroy Britain's strength, but the British Royal Air Force does not seem to be Germany's enemy, and the result of the air raid is not only insufficient to weaken Britain's fighting power and will, but also strengthens Britain's internal unity, as well as America's sympathy and assistance to Britain.</p>
<p>The Far East is Favorable to China. This time, the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan has aroused strong resentment from Britain and the United States, and further obtained sincere cooperation in various aspects. Germany's move will prove to be very unwise. Even in the Far East, it will only create a favorable situation for China. Without the constraints of the alliance of three nations, the Soviet Union seems to be able to provide more concrete assistance to China. The United States wants to maintain its Far East interests, and lending is an inevitable result, and Britain's consideration of opening the Yunnan-Burma Road is also not the end.</p>
<p>Opening the Yunnan-Burma Road is Not a Problem</p>
<p>The reporter also asked whether opening the Yunnan-Burma Road would be possible. According to the observer, opening the Yunnan-Burma Road seems to be no longer a problem. At that time, Britain, in addition to establishing an adversarial relationship with Germany and Italy in Europe, made considerable compromises and mediation with other countries in the world to the extent possible. Blocking the Yunnan-Burma Road was an attempt to compromise and mediate with Japan. However, the British people did not agree with this move. Now that the opening date is not far away, the British government has been urged to open it. At this time, the alliance of three nations occurred, then Japan has clearly become an enemy of Britain as well. Britain has no need or possibility to compromise again, so reopening after the three-month period expires seems to be no longer a problem.</p>
<p>The United States Continues to Lend China Huge Sums</p>
<p>The United States is actively assisting China. In addition to lending US$250 million, it has also lent US$130 million to China. A reporter from the Pyeongmin News Agency yesterday made a special inquiry to a certain foreign financial authority in this city. According to reports, the United States continues to lend huge sums to China. The number of Shanghai has not been able to obtain confirmed news, but it is known that the central government representative Song Ziwen is continuing to make huge loans in the United States, which is quite smooth, and it is also very possible. However, based on common sense, the United States will continue to support China economically in the future. This loan amount, in terms of quantity, is not large, but in terms of its nature, it is not a purely loan, it is just an advance payment and collects China's metal mines.</p>
<p>Supporting China is also Self-Defense</p>
<p>The result of China's three-year war of resistance has created a force in the Far East that cannot be easily intimidated. China's need for economic assistance from friendly countries is like the need for China to weaken the forces of the aggressors by friendly countries in the Pacific. The United States has long recognized this point clearly, so supporting China's war of resistance is to consolidate its periphery. The reason why the United States has to help China is here.</p>
<p>The United States Does Not Change its Traditional Policy</p>
<p>From the perspective of the United States' traditional policy, the United States' policy towards China, as we all know, is the so-called open door policy. We must know that this policy is based on the so-called balance of power in the Pacific. However, the establishment of this balance of power cannot be achieved by the strength of the United States alone, so it must be supported by Britain to be able to do it. At the Washington Conference, Britain did not continue the Anglo-Japanese alliance, but fully supported the United States, and as a result, the Washington Treaty was established. This situation came to an end in 1931 on September 18. The reason why this happened is that the British at that time did not cooperate with the United States to jointly sanction the aggressors, resulting in an unmanageable situation in the Pacific.</p>
<p>British-American Cooperation is Inevitable</p>
<p>However, this situation, with the expansion of the war in Western Europe and the rapid turn of events in the Pacific, the relative decline of Britain's position, and the relative increase of the United States' position, the United States' position has a pivotal trend, and Britain, in order to obtain American assistance, cannot but follow the lead of the United States in the Pacific and the Atlantic, so British-American cooperation in the world is an inevitable trend. For its own interests and to obtain American assistance, Britain has abandoned its imagined appeasement policy and given China active assistance. Opening the Yunnan-Burma Road and lending large sums of money to China is its due.</p>
<p>The Situation in Shanghai Can Be Temporarily Assured</p>
<p>The reporter also raised the question of the status of Shanghai under the Southern Advance Policy. According to the opinion of a certain financier, the status of Shanghai is also a part of the Far East situation, and it is determined by the international situation. However, it can be asserted that in the current situation, the attitude of Britain and the United States has turned tough. Although Japan has joined the alliance of Germany and Italy, it is involved in the China Incident and does not have the strength to engage in war against third countries, so in the short term, it can still maintain considerable stability.</p>
<h3>The French Business Water and Electricity Strike is About to be Resolved; Negotiations Continue Today</h3>
<p>The strike of the French Concession Water and Electricity Company's tram, bus, and engine room, which has been delayed for ten days, has shown signs of breaking the deadlock since the labor representatives requested the French Police Department's Political Affairs Department to mediate. The labor and management have also been in contact twice in the past two days. It is reported that the labor will once again appeal to people from all walks of life for assistance. The details obtained yesterday are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Company's Reply</p>
<p>Striking Workers Quickly Seek to Resolve the Strike. On the afternoon of the 2nd, six representatives were elected to go to the Political Affairs Department of the French Police Department to request mediation. At 7:00 p.m., French Political Affairs Minister Mallet. French Water and Electricity Company General Manager Favre. Transportation Manager Michel. And six labor representatives, with mutual concessions and understanding between labor and management, began preliminary negotiations. General Manager Favre immediately stated (1) Regarding the increase in rice subsidies, the company can allow the same treatment for the transportation department as for the engine room, (2) The arrested workers can be released, (3) The wages during the strike period can also be paid. The labor representatives must convey the conditions replied by the General Manager to all the workers before they can make a decision. It was immediately scheduled for today (5th) at 11:00 a.m. to negotiate again.</p>
<p>The English Great American newspaper reported this morning (4th) that according to a certain member of the French Tram Company, the tram and bus business in the French Concession is expected to return to normal tomorrow (5th). Labor-management talks are progressing smoothly.</p>
<p>Three People Were Kidnapped</p>
<p>At around 1:00 a.m. yesterday, three more people were kidnapped. Xu No. 26, No. 28, two ticket inspectors, and No. 10, a ticket writer. Although the relevant parties have tried their best to search for where these three people were taken, no clues have been obtained. The French Police Department and the company are very concerned about the continued occurrence of such incidents. According to a reporter from the News Agency, at noon yesterday, the French Police Department sent many Chinese and Western officers to arrest six tram company ticket sellers near Xiafei Road and Villermont Road. It is heard that they are related to the kidnapping case.</p>
<h3>It is Reported That American Banks Will Soon Refuse to Sell Foreign Exchange; The Purpose is Aimed at Japanese Businesses; American Goods Transported to the Mainland Have Been Completely Controlled</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the Allied News Agency said last night (3rd) that American banks in this city will refuse to sell foreign exchange in the future. Although it is not specifically stipulated that foreign exchange will only be refused to Japanese businesses, financial observers believe that this move by American banks is actually aimed at Japanese businesses, because it follows Japan's conclusion of an alliance with Germany and Italy, and takes this step. Some say that this move by American banks is not an economic retaliation for Japan's joining the Axis powers, but also admit that this is a preventive measure by American banks, fearing that American-Japanese relations will continue to deteriorate.</p>
<p>Coastal Blockade Prevents American Goods</p>
<p>According to another opinion, Japan is strictly blockading the Chinese coast, and the transport of American goods into the Chinese mainland has therefore decreased, and most of the banking business related to exports in the occupied areas is handled by Japanese businesses. The American banks' business of issuing export orders has been cut off, and the American banks' business has suffered losses, so they have refused to sell foreign exchange, which in turn has hit Japanese businesses.</p>
<p>Japanese Businesses are Uneasy and Seek Other Solutions</p>
<p>Some observers believe that the Chinese have gradually lost confidence in the pound, and now they are speculating in US dollars. American businesses have refused to sell foreign exchange in order to reduce this kind of speculative activity. As for the Japanese banking industry, it had originally expected a reaction in the Shanghai financial market after the conclusion of the pact in Berlin, and is now planning to convene a meeting in the short term to discuss countermeasures. It is heard that Japanese banks will conduct US dollar futures transactions through French and Belgian banks.</p>
<p>Cotton Spinning Mills are Most Affected</p>
<p>At the same time, the Japanese cotton spinning mills, which are most affected by this move by American banks, said that the result of American banks' refusal to sell foreign exchange will continue to reduce American cotton exports, and cotton spinners have already purchased foreign exchange and will not be affected by it for the time being. Other Japanese business leaders will also not be able to import new goods, but can purchase the goods they need from Chinese and foreign importers in this city.</p>
<h3>French Ambassador Cosme Left Shanghai for Chongqing Yesterday Morning; He Will Visit the Central Authorities to Discuss the Situation; He Will Meet Lieutenant General Degoutte in Vietnam on the Way</h3>
<p>French Ambassador to China Cosme, arrived in Shanghai on April 28 this year from Chongqing via Hong Kong on the French postal ship Rossel. The ambassador originally came to Shanghai to go to Beidaihe for summer vacation, but later, due to</p>
<p>Tightening of the European War</p>
<p>The French and German sides have engaged in direct warfare. The affairs of this consulate have also become complicated as a result. Cosme was not in a position to leave immediately. It was not until the conclusion of the Franco-German agreement that the consulate and diplomatic affairs would be presided over by the ambassador himself. Therefore, the trip to the north was abandoned repeatedly. Now it is learned that the ambassador has no need to go north because the height of summer has passed. Therefore, he left Shanghai on the Yihuo Shipping Company's Mingsheng ship at 5:00 a.m. yesterday, first going to Hong Kong, and then waiting for the ship to go to Vietnam. The ambassador believes that although the situation in Vietnam has yielded to Japan,</p>
<p>The Situation is Chaotic</p>
<p>It has not yet been clarified, and Thailand is fueling the flames and demanding land from Vietnam. To what extent will the changes be in the future? The ambassador needs to understand clearly. On the way to Chongqing, he will first meet Lieutenant General Degoutte, the Governor of Vietnam, and stay in French Indochina for a while, and then take a plane to Chongqing to visit the central authorities and discuss the situation. While the ambassador was in Shanghai, he also had some</p>
<p>Leisurely Interests</p>
<p>The city has been experiencing heavy rains for days, and the roads have been flooded into rivers. The ambassador went to the China Building (commonly known as the Thirteenth Floor Building) from the French Association on Pushi Road the day before yesterday and specially ordered his attendants to row the No. 524 sampan to cross the boat. Observers stood around and watched. According to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency, the ambassador's wife did not travel with him this time and is currently residing in Dongjiaomin Lane, Beiping. It is heard that when the weather turns cold, she will come to Shanghai for the winter.</p>

<h3>Case of Japanese and European Soldiers Insulting American Soldiers Not Yet Resolved; America Awaits Reply</h3>
<p>According to the English-language *China Press*, regarding the incident on the night of the 28th of last month, in which Japanese military police insulted and assaulted Boatner, a first-class seaman of the American warship *Augusta*, inside the Bank of Communications Building on the Bund, the U.S. Naval authorities in Shanghai sent a letter to the Japanese authorities on Monday to inquire about the matter. A reply from the Japanese side is still awaited. Officials from both the U.S. and Japan stated today (the 4th) that there have been no changes in this matter. The Japanese side believes the matter has been concluded, while the U.S. officials stated that it has not been resolved and are awaiting a reply from the Japanese side.</p>
<h3>Eight-Fen Stamps Not Yet Fully Printed; Temporary Combination Use Still Employed; Zhu Lieshi Commemorative Stamps Mixed for Sale by Post Office</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of postage rate increases in the country, the Directorate General of Posts is currently designing and printing new 4-fen and 8-fen stamps for use. At present, the Shanghai Post Office, in order to facilitate public use, has already issued all 8-fen Zhu Zhixin Martyr Commemorative Stamps and the Peiping version of Sun Yat-sen 4-fen stamps. However, after they are sold out, spare postage stamps will be temporarily used in combination to make up the amount. The new stamps will not be printed in Hong Kong, shipped to Shanghai, and sold until next year. It is heard that some people mistakenly believe that the currently issued Zhu Zhixin Martyr Commemorative Stamps are the new stamps that have arrived in Shanghai, but this is not the case. According to inquiries by the *Datong* reporter, these 8-fen stamps were originally prepared for registered mail and the number prepared was not large, with only a small amount issued at ordinary times. Now that the postage for ordinary letters has increased to 8 fen, the need for these stamps has suddenly increased. Therefore, the post office is specially selling them mixed with other denominations to meet the demand.</p>
<h3>Notice of Temporary Suspension of Parcel Post</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Stock Breeding Company Director Ma Shao Cong Reportedly Kidnapped; Company Denies the Incident, Claims He Has Taken His Family by Ship to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Ma Shao Cong, the owner of the Shanghai Stock Breeding Company on Dunxin Road, a road built across the border in western Shanghai, a native of Guangdong, in his thirties, took a streetcar to the company office on the morning of four days ago. Unexpectedly, just as he arrived at the gate, several kidnappers, who had been lying in wait there, swarmed up as soon as they saw him, brandishing pistols and threatening him. As a result, they dragged him into a car and sped away. The matter has not yet been reported to the police. The *Pingming News* reporter inquired with the company, which initially gave evasive answers, but later admitted the incident and said that Ma had taken his family by ship to Hong Kong last month. Afterwards, the reporter inquired in the vicinity of the scene of the incident, and everyone claimed that the incident did indeed occur.</p>
<p>Another report states that it is rumored that Mr. Ma, the boss of a certain stock breeding company on Dunxin Road in western Shanghai, was kidnapped at his residence several days ago and has not been heard from since.

<h3>Robbery of a Restaurant; One Bandit Apprehended; A Pistol Seized</h3>
<p>The Xiao Leyi Restaurant at 440 Zhejiang Road was suddenly broken into by several bandits with weapons at 8 PM the day before yesterday. Brandishing weapons, they robbed 280 yuan in cash from the cash register and fled. At that time, Zhang Junliang, an employee of the restaurant, followed behind a bandit holding a pistol. Upon reaching the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road, he reported to Chinese Detective Sun Dafa, as well as Chinese police officers numbers 690 and 766. The detectives and police officers stepped forward to arrest him. Unexpectedly, the bandit immediately pulled out his gun and fired, but the magazine inside the bandit's pistol was damaged, causing the bullet to jam and fail to fire. He still ran away in an attempt to escape, but was apprehended at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Fujian Road. A pistol and five bullets were seized from him. He was taken back to the police station. Under questioning, he revealed his name as Wang Asan, a native of Jiangbei, thirty years old. The stolen money was hidden by other bandits, so it could not be recovered. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Division of the Special Court. Police lawyer Ru Bao Yi requested a postponement on the grounds that the accomplices still needed to be investigated. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, he ordered the suspect to be detained pending a further hearing.</p>
<h3>A Teenager Forced by Poverty to Help a Korean Traffic Drugs</h3>
<p>Zhu Chunhe, a 17-year-old youth from Yuyao, received elementary education. Due to the outbreak of the Shanghai war, he fled and became separated from his parents, leaving him destitute. He risked helping Koreans transport drugs for a living, earning a monthly salary of 15 yuan. A bicycle was provided by the Koreans. Every day, he transported 200-300 packages of morphine from Hongkou to the overpass building in the Huabao Fang on Huanghe Road, where he handed them over to the Koreans for sale. This had been going on for two years. Yesterday, the French Police Bureau learned of this and sent detectives to wait in Huabao Fang, where they apprehended Zhu and seized 180 packages of morphine, along with a bicycle. He was taken to the police station and escorted to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court yesterday afternoon and prosecuted according to law. Judge Zhang Minsheng presided over the trial. The defendant admitted that because he had no means of making a living, he helped transport drugs for two years and four months. After reviewing the circumstances, the court announced the conclusion of the trial and scheduled the verdict for 2 PM on the 9th of this month. The bicycle was stored in the property depository.</p>
<h3>Maid Servants Theft; Reeducation Implemented</h3>
<p>Chunxiang, a 14-year-old maid servant in the home of lawyer Xu Zifeng at 269 Wuding Road, secretly stole 648 yuan in legal tender from Xu's desk drawer between October of the 27th year and August of this year. Xu did not suspect Chunxiang, until recently, when Xu's wife, Wu, noticed Chunxiang's poor behavior and planned to send her back to her native Danyang. Chunxiang, upon hearing this, demanded the return of borrowed money from the cook, Ms. Wang of Yangzhou, 275 yuan; the chauffeur, Zhang Yongguan of Yangzhou, 113 yuan; and Wang Yu, a female helper from Anhui, 50 yuan, but they did not repay it, leading to mutual quarrels. Mrs. Xu Wu learned of this, and the theft of legal tender from three years ago was revealed. She reported the situation to the Gordon Road Police Station, which dispatched detectives to the address and took Chunxiang and others to the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin requested punishment according to law. After being advised to await sentencing, Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the Third Criminal Division yesterday morning and delivered the verdict: Wang Xu was sentenced to three months of imprisonment; Zhang Yongguan and Wang Yu were each fined 50 yuan, with a two-year suspended sentence; Xu Chunxiang, being young, was exempted from punishment and subject to six months of reeducation to be replaced by protective custody.

<h3>Song Chunyu Dies by Poison; Court Calls for Claim of Belongings</h3>
<p>Song Chunyu, a native of Huzhou, 28 years old, resided in his native place and was engaged in shipping business. Last month, Song suffered injustice in connection with his business and had no way to clear his name. In a moment of resentment, he locked himself in a room at the Yu Qiaqing Road Far Eastern Hotel and committed suicide by taking poison. He died from the severity of the poison. The First Special District Court dispatched a prosecutor to examine the body. Because he had no family members, the body was handed over to the Pushan Villa for coffin burial and temporary placement. To this day, his family members are still unaware. The Prosecutor's Office of the First Special Court issued a notice stating that if anyone knows the whereabouts of Song's family members, please inform them immediately. Song has several items of personal belongings that are currently stored in the court's warehouse. It is hoped that Song's family members will go to claim them.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Education and Cultural Circles Launch Model Airplane Movement; Scheduled to be Held on the 27th of this Month; Plan to Establish Rotating Awards and Research Grants</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) Hong Kong education and cultural circles are recently vigorously promoting the "Model Airplane Movement" in order to promote aviation knowledge among young students. This movement is of great help in increasing the foundation of aviation knowledge for young people. Advanced aviation countries, such as the United States, Germany, and Japan, have spared no effort in promoting the production and demonstration of model airplanes in recent years. This movement is quite common in the United States. The widespread development of the aviation industry in the United States and the enthusiastic participation of young people across the country in the aviation industry are all due to this movement. It instills basic aviation knowledge from childhood and enhances their enthusiasm and interest in the aviation industry. It is learned that several groups, such as the Hong Kong University Alumni Association, the Teachers' Federation, the Student Relief Association, and the *Ta Kung Pao*, have specifically scheduled a Hong Kong-wide open model airplane competition on October 27th in order to increase the understanding and interest of social figures and young students in model airplanes. The competition matters are now being actively prepared by the above-mentioned groups. It is said that this competition will be divided into three categories: outdoor frame airplanes, outdoor gliding airplanes, and outdoor gasoline-powered frame airplanes. As for the prizes, it is planned to establish permanent awards such as the "Hong Kong Open Model Airplane Competition Cup," similar to the Davis Cup in the tennis world, and "Aircraft Model Research" grants, to be awarded to the winners of each competition. The proposed competition rules are transcribed as follows:</p>
<p>Competition Rules</p>
<p>First Item: Outdoor Frame Airplane Competition (Hand-Launched Flight Method) This competition plane must have a skeleton structure and landing wheels. The wing area must be no less than 50 square inches. The maximum cross-sectional area of the fuselage must also be no less than the square inches obtained by the formula L2/100 (L is equal to the length of the fuselage, excluding the propeller). The weight of each 50 square inches of wing area must not be less than one ounce. Regardless of the form of the fuselage, the fuselage must be tightly covered, or no less than 90 percent. The current model airplane construction is still in its primary stage, so it is permissible for the cross-sectional area of its fuselage to be no less than 90 percent of the formula. All other forms and frames, or those not in accordance with the formula, may not participate. Second Item: Outdoor Gliding Airplane Competition (Hand-Launched Flight)</p>
<p>This competition plane must not be attached with rubber bands, and its wing area must not be less than 40 square inches. The wings, fuselage, and tail rudder can be constructed from aircraft wood or other (materials). However, it must be hand-launched and must not fly by relying on other thrusts.</p>
<p>Third Item: Outdoor Gasoline-Powered Frame Airplane Competition (Ground-Launched Flight) This competition must rely on internal combustion engine-powered flight, that is, the gasoline motor wing area must not be less than 200 square inches, and must be pushed by a skeleton-constructed motor for a limit of 30 seconds. The most important thing is that the competitor of this competition must calibrate the timer to 30 seconds. The plane takes off from the ground, but can be pushed by hand. The maximum cross-sectional area of the fuselage must also be no less than the square inches obtained by the formula L2/100 (L is equal to the length of the fuselage, excluding the propeller). Regardless of the form of the fuselage, the fuselage must be tightly covered, or no less than 90 percent. The internal combustion displacement of the gasoline motor is calculated at every cubic inch, and the total weight of the plane must not be less than 60 ounces.</p>
<p>Competition Regulations</p>
<p>The model airplanes participating in the competition must be constructed by the competitors themselves, but wheels, propellers, and other small parts can be purchased. Those that are entirely purchased cannot be selected. The model style can be adopted at will.</p>
<p>Each competitor will be given a participation certificate as proof that the registration fee has been paid. The certificate must be used to bring a friend into the competition arena. The number in the upper left corner of the certificate must be painted or glued onto the top of the wing, no less than half an inch to two inches high. Each plane uses only one number and cannot be changed.</p>
<p>Time Regulations for Each Item</p>

<h3>Gu Ziren Returns Home; Attended the World Youth Student Federation Congress in the United States</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) Gu Ziren, the representative who attended the World Youth Student Federation Congress, arrived in Hong Kong by ship from the United States on September 27th. The reporter interviewed him the next day and discussed his impressions. He stated, "I received orders to go abroad last year and arrived in the United States in January of this year. After staying for three months, I went to Canada and only set off for Hong Kong last month. Over the past few months, I have been promoting the motherland and religion everywhere. The youth of America express great sympathy for our resistance, but the emotion is more than action. Because most of them advocate, they are trying their best to avoid war, and they will never take action beyond verbally sympathizing with the invaded. Moreover, in fact, the United States is not clear about all international trends until the election is over." Gu is scheduled to go to India next week and will be able to return home in the spring of next year.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Declines Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial market for spot gold continued to decline, influenced by the stronger foreign exchange rates and negative news. This created uncertainty, leading to increased selling. Although the market rebounded slightly in the afternoon due to short covering, it eventually lost momentum and closed at $5,812, down $41 from the previous day. The total trading volume was approximately $3,000. The price of gold jewelry remained unchanged, as did the prices for Customs Gold Units.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Declined by Almost Forty Yuan</p>
<p>Initially, market sentiment remained firm. Despite stronger foreign exchange rates, there were very few sellers. Gold dealers opened at $5,880 for twenty taels. Soon after, gold dealers aggressively bought, driving the price up to $5,908. However, as foreign exchange rates weakened and currency exchange houses heavily sold gold, the price declined. Securities firms sold twenty taels of gold at $5,860. Later, currency exchange houses covered their short positions, causing the price to rise again. Gold dealers bought thirty taels from securities firms at $5,880. Unexpectedly, gold and silver shops sold heavily near noon, making it difficult to maintain prices, which fell as low as $5,850. Ultimately, gold dealers traded ten taels at $5,858 at the noon close. The market showed further signs of weakness in the afternoon due to widespread negative rumors and continued weakening of foreign exchange rates. Gold dealers sold twenty taels to gold shops at $5,830 as the opening price. Subsequently, gold dealers bought ten taels from securities firms at $5,840. At that time, gold and silver shops were selling, pushing the price below $5,800. Securities firms bought ten taels from gold dealers at $5,790.

<h3>Starting from the Purchase and Sale of Trademarks</h3>
<p>— Cai Jiedong</p>
<p>A trademark is nominally a symbol of a commodity. In reality, it represents the entire commodity. The term "old brand" means that the significance of a trademark exceeds the commodity itself. The trademark itself has an intangible value, and when there are changes in the commodity itself or when a trademark is transferred, the trademark's inherent value becomes even more apparent. A trademark, as a commodity symbol, also becomes a commodity itself.</p>
<p>Although this situation is not common, it has been observed recently. Furthermore, it is no longer a simple transfer but rather a wholesale and retail sale, much like a wholesale distributor. The trademark's meaning as a commodity is even more evident. This phenomenon arises under current special circumstances.</p>
<p>In order to counter the "economic blockade," all imported goods must be reviewed. To make it easier for merchants to comply, certain types of products are approved for import, while others are not. However, if the trademark approved for import is exchanged with another factory, one party can freely import goods by falsely using that trademark. Therefore, they are willing to pay a considerable price, while the other party enjoys the benefit of selling, disregarding both reason and justice, and nullifying the good intention of allowing the import of goods with that trademark. The merchant women do not know the hatred of a conquered nation, still singing the backyard flower across the river. Today's treacherous merchants are even worse than this.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Decline Across the Board</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw spot gold transition from a firm to a declining trend. British and American gold pounds also initially strengthened before weakening, ultimately falling by five corners. The supply and demand for British gold notes were balanced, and the market price remained stable. American gold notes showed a weakening trend, with the market price ultimately falling by twelve cents. Hong Kong notes saw a slight increase in supply, and the market price softened slightly by one cent. The supply and demand for Japanese gold notes remained balanced, and the market remained unchanged at $1.46 in the evening. Korean notes saw considerable demand, with the evening price falling to $1.15.</p>
<h3>Grains: New Indica Rice Recovers Slightly, Thick and Thin Japonica Rice Remain Scarce, Foreign Rice Prices Fluctuate</h3>
<p>After a period of decline in the foreign rice market, prices opened higher yesterday due to three or four telegrams from various foreign firms placing orders. General speculators rushed to sell. Subsequently, actual sales slowed, causing prices to decline. In the central market, prices plummeted by more than 1.5 yuan. However, because the foreign prices were still difficult to lower, telegrams from Saigon and other places stated that the situation was similar to the previous market. Therefore, general merchants and large dealers were unwilling to sell lightly. The branches of the British-Chinese Bank in Saigon were still quoting $82 for grade 2 Saigon rice, while foreign firms quoted $80. The upper period for October was $79.60, all the same as the previous day's selling prices. By the afternoon, some took profits, and international rumors were unfavorable to buyers, causing the afternoon rebound to reverse again. The current price of foreign rice has fallen by about 2 yuan. British-Chinese original packaged grade 2 Saigon rice has fallen to about $78.50. Original packaged grade 2 Siamese rice is only about $77. Total transactions for original packaged rice were 400-500 tons, while transactions for spot rice were 4,500-5,600 bags. Grade 2 Saigon rice was priced at $68.30 or $68, grade 2 Siamese rice at $66.50 or $66, small-grain rice at $65.50, and rice tea at $68 or $67.</p>
<p>Thick and Thin Japonica Rice. As the decline in foreign rice prices intensified, the market supply disappeared. Although prices rebounded later, no one wanted to sell, resulting in no transactions for the entire day. The market for glutinous rice was originally slow. As a result of this influence, it became even harder to support, and prices fell by one yuan. Jinli special-grade rice opened at $73, Changdan rice at $71.2, and Hong Kong glutinous rice was the same. There were no transactions for glutinous green rice.</p>
<p>New Indica Rice. Recent arrivals from downriver have been quite strong, no less than 1,300-1,400 piculs. However, due to its soft texture and lack of durability, the owners all sought to sell quickly. As sales were poor, the price of new Indica rice plummeted by a huge 4-5 yuan. Yangdu and other fine Indica varieties also fell by 3-4 yuan. Zhuanqiao new Indica rice was priced at $82, Taicang Yangjian rice at $70 or $69, and Qingjiao Dujian rice at $72.</p>
<h3>Customer Sales Increase, Market Steps Become Tight</h3>
<p>Flour. Yesterday's flour market trended secretly tight. While the price of flour from the number two flour factory was $16.50, the supply from various factories gradually decreased. As there was a customer demand movement, the current flour supply was insufficient. Additionally, rising rice prices further strengthened positive market sentiment. Therefore, speculative hoarders were again buying warehouse receipts. Old warehouse receipts have tightened to $18.10-18.20, and there is little available for sale. Due to insufficient supplies, foreign flour prices were the same as the factory's customer prices at $18.50-18.60. It is heard that Northern and Southern merchants added orders for nearly 10,000 bags, and wholesale prices in the street may increase.</p>
<p>Wheat. Yesterday's trading continued to be quiet, and arrivals remained scarce. It was even more difficult to transport wheat into the concessions. Therefore, buying and selling were difficult to start. It is heard that the price for scattered deliveries to Japanese factories was limited to $21.00. The purchase price for Chinese factories remained at $24.65. However, with the flour market tightening, sellers had the intention to raise prices, making transactions even more quiet.</p>
<h3>Domestic Debt Excited, New High Prices Seen Again</h3>
<p>The unofficial securities market saw a slight change in trend yesterday. The market initially showed some weakness in the morning, but was pulled higher near the close, leaving the morning closing flat. In the afternoon, a Japanese telegram outage caused market misunderstanding. After the opening, buyers were extremely enthusiastic. Class C shares broke through $59, reaching a new high price of $59.50. Unfortunately, it failed to hold. The prospect may see a slight pullback due to excessive floating positions. Yesterday morning, buyers aggressively purchased shares of number 6, 16 and 41, although less than the previous day. Lianhe, Xieda, and Xinfu all had demand. Tongkang, Lianyi, Hongda, and Yichang were all sellers. The buying expanded sharply in the afternoon, with Xinfu, Lianhe and number 6 continuing to buy. Xin Chang, Jiufeng, Shuntai, Tongji and a large number of retail investors also bought shares. Tongkang, Lianyi and Hongji continued to sell off. Hengkang also sold some shares. The market price jumped half a yuan at the opening, and classes A, B, C, D, and E all saw high prices, adding frosting to the cake. However, it was heard after the close that the Japanese telegraph line had been repaired, clarifying the misunderstanding. As a result, the market price continued to increase by $0.10 to $0.50. The total transaction volume was approximately $1.7 million. A simplified table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Trading: Fifty shares of Xinya Pharmaceutical were traded at a price of $24.75.</p>
<p>Yesterday's stock market saw large volumes, with excessive floating positions settled and prices unsupported. Buyer appetite was strong during price declines, and transactions were extremely large.</p>
<p>London, 3rd (Thursday) Telegram: Today's London listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British merchant company stocks remain flat. Only bank stocks showed slight fluctuations. The price of the McCallum Bank stock increased by 2 shillings and 6 pence to £6.17.6. The price of the London-registered stock of HSBC Bank fell by £1.5 to £64. The price of the Hong Kong-registered stock was unchanged. The price of the Youli Bank stock fell by 5 shillings to £10.0.15. The rest were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Speculation Concentrated, Cloth Prices Soar, Double Horse Jumps Up $57.50</h3>
<p>The yarn market is strengthening and the rising trend is particularly strong. This is because the local merchants have an urgent need for ten-count coarse yarn, which makes people feel confident. At the same time, the Japanese yarn market is soaring, which is intensifying the mood. Speculators are also becoming more active after a long period of inactivity, and the rising trend is strong. Merchants from Tianjin, as well as related and unrelated businesses, are all participating. As a result, the rising trend has turned around, and the market has gone straight up. Today, 410 pieces of yarn were exported to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>At the opening of the spot yarn market, there were many rumors circulating after midday the previous day, saying that the market price on the exchange had improved. There were few sellers and many buyers in the market. The first-round price was $1,125, up $10, and hovered around $1,130 for a long time. Later, it was heard that Guangzhou merchants still wanted coarse yarn. At the same time, it was said that the price of a certain yarn had soared, and the mood suddenly became heated. Buyers flocked in, and the market rose higher and higher, reaching $1,157. After the close, it rose another $10. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 4,270 bales were traded. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by $57. The amount of yarn purchased by each merchant is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Merchants 2,970, Hong Kong 1,300, Total 4,270.</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Up $10, Most Transactions are in Foreign Cotton</h3>
<p>Spot cotton transactions have developed greatly, because the soaring price of cloth has caused the price of raw cotton, which are closely related, to rise as well. Therefore, factory activity is concentrated, and merchant buying is strong. The price of cotton has risen by $10. Most of the transactions are in foreign cotton.</p>
<p>Another message: In the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market was quiet. Later, because the need for spot goods increased, and some short positions were covered, the closing price was higher than the previous day by 2-3 British units. The forecast for Indian quick cotton is an increase of one and a half rupees.</p>
<p>The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been quite active recently. The inventory of the merchants is in danger of being bought up. The factories also know the difficulty of transporting foreign cotton to Shanghai. In addition, the price of yarn is soaring, and the factory's desire to buy is strong. According to this situation, the price of cotton will rise without limit.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cloth Prices Follow Yarn, Step by Step</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth. Yesterday, the rising momentum of cloth followed yarn was very sharp. The buying interest was becoming increasingly strong. The strongest appetite was from local merchants, dyeing factories, and hoarders. The selling price at the beginning of the day rose by 1.5 corners per piece. Afterwards, it increased step by step. As a result, fine cloth and fine twill colored cloth rose by 7.5 corners to 1 yuan per piece compared to the previous day.

<h3>Oil Cakes: Oil Prices Only Increase</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the oil market only increased, with no decline. Although there are ups and downs in the current raw bean oil, the form of squeezing the short positions has gradually become apparent. There is no small pullback to be seen in the future. The results yesterday show that bean oil increased by another two yuan, and raw oil continued to rise by another three yuan. Transactions were 300 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, priced at $76 to $76.50. 500 pieces for delivery in the first ten days of October, priced at $76.60 to $76.75. 2,200 to 2,300 pieces for delivery in the last ten days of October, priced from $78 to $78.25, back to $77.50, and then re-stacked to $79 at the close. 100 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, priced at $106.07. 300 barrels for delivery in the last ten days of October, priced at $107.50 to $108.50. 200 barrels for delivery in November, priced at $109.50 to $110. 500 tins of Yanhao listened to raw oil, priced at $100. 60 pieces of Jiaozhou bean oil, priced at $82.50. 50 pieces of Yanqi bean oil, priced at $84. 20 pieces of Qingqi bean oil, priced at $83. 250 dan of bulk Dalian oil, priced at $92. 500 dan of Dayou factory bean oil, priced at $92.50, $93.50.</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk's Path Out Relies Only on American Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday's overseas silk market was firm and stable. New York showed no major fluctuations. Yokohama spot goods were down 15 yuan, and forward goods were down 2 yuan. However, it is still 35 yuan higher than the support line, so it is not a cause for concern. In the local silk market, transactions were heard for grade 7 and 8 white silk, priced at $5,225. The sales path to the United States is still grand, but there are only scattered transactions of manual goods.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Dried Longan Sees New High Price</h3>
<p>Hainan dried longan: Because the source is temporarily blocked, the market is very interested in purchasing. The quoted price has risen rapidly, initially from 190 yuan to 195 yuan, and then broke the 200 yuan mark, reaching a new high price of 205 yuan. As a result, the market price has also tracked and reached 200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Marine Products: Dried Mussels from Ningbo Have a Continuous Source</h3>
<p>Since the blockade of Shanghai and Ningbo, navigation has not yet recovered. The marine products from Ningbo only rely on civilian ships for transportation. Therefore, the source of dried mussels from Ningbo has not been cut off. According to the latest information, the quoted price of the original dried mussels is 345 yuan. Dutch cotton white BS mark is 75 yuan, Dutch red is 59.6 yuan, Taikoo car white B mark is 75.6 yuan, DY mark is 73.4 yuan, HX Ka is 73.15 yuan, small 2 yuan to a corner and a half, HM mark is 67 yuan, smaller than before (2nd) small corners. This factory's ice grade 1 is 98.5 yuan, and Jingming ice is 100 yuan, both down 1.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Black Iron Billets Exit the Thousand Yuan Mark, Wire Rods Surge</h3>
<p>Yesterday, black iron billets were searched by Tianjin merchants, reaching hundreds of bundles. The local iron printing factories, canning factories, mirror factories, machinery factories, etc. also purchased them, so the market atmosphere was temporarily impacted, and people were in high spirits. Those holding goods thought about reigniting, and the standard soared straight up, re-entering the thousand-yuan mark, more than a hundred yuan higher than before. The quoted price for 30 to 34 thin goods is still around 1,200 yuan.</p>
<p>In recent days, the new wire rod has exceeded the price of Yuan Ding nails and has soared. Currently, Yuan Ding is only shouting 56-57 yuan, while the market price of wire rod has soared to 61-62 yuan. The reason for this is not only that the local nail factories are eagerly searching for construction, but also that the sales path to foreign merchants has also been opened, so there is such a strong phenomenon.</p>
<h3>Notice</h3>

<h3>Miscellaneous Items: New Prices for Cigarettes</h3>
<p>Due to the issue of increased taxes, the price of cigarettes on the unofficial market has been soaring. Yesterday, the new prices were announced. The new price of the Great British brand, managed by Wing Tai Wo Company, is 1,300 yuan. Fifty-stick packs are 1,370 yuan. Old Knife brand is 900 yuan, Pinhai brand is 850 yuan, Guanglu brand is 650 yuan, Hade Men is 650 yuan, Golden is 650 yuan, Wuhua brand is 650 yuan, Little Fairy brand is 650 yuan, Red Seal brand is 650 yuan, and Datai Bridge brand is 830 yuan.

<h3>Coal: Charcoal Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai-Wenzhou line was cut off, no Wenzhou charcoal has arrived. Even those coming from Shenjiamen in the occupied area are also facing obstacles. As a result, the city is running low. The market price is soaring. The high price for Wenzhou grade A charcoal is 15 yuan per dan, but there is no market, and there is no spot. Huangyan charcoal is 12.6 yuan, and small Jiping hat charcoal is 11.2 yuan. The retail price in the local door shop is 2.5 corners per pound.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: All Sugar Prices Return to Lower Levels</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained soft. Coarse white sugar was stable, but second-grade and lower grades of white sugar continued to ease. The association's price quotation for existing stock was 24 yuan for coarse white sugar, 78.5 yuan at our own warehouse, 78 yuan for new stock at other warehouses, 76 yuan for old stock from May, and 61 yuan for transshipment goods.</p>

<h3>Blood Transfusion King</h3>
<p>— Mo Ming</p>
<p>On July 4, 1935, in Philadelphia, USA, a three-year-old girl named Rosemary was injured in the back by a firecracker set off by a naughty boy. Rosemary's loving aunt, Mrs. McMnllin, immediately rushed her to the hospital. There, her wounds were carefully cleaned, medicated, and injected with a tetanus vaccine. The protection could be said to be comprehensive, but she was still infected by bacteria. Her body temperature soared, eventually rising to 107 degrees; her abdomen swelled up, and her legs swelled like sausages. Doctors discovered that her blood was full of terrible "suppurative Staphylococcus aureus," a bacterium that could not be controlled by any medicine. The doctors shook their heads and told Mrs. McMullin that the child had no hope unless she could find a blood donor who had previously suffered from the same disease.</p>
<p>Mrs. McMullin ran off to pray in disappointment. During her silent prayer, she had a sudden inspiration and came up with an extraordinary idea. She told the doctor, who initially refused this appalling request, but eventually agreed. So, Rosemary's poisoned blood was drawn out, made into a vaccine, and then injected into Mrs. McMullin's blood. She immediately developed the same disease, and at the same time, a large number of sterilized antitoxins were produced in her blood. This blood could be lent to her niece to destroy the bacteria. Within a few days, she gave a total of 29 doses of blood to Rosemary, and this little life was finally snatched back from the clutches of death.</p>
<p>Mrs. McMullin had previously suffered from diphtheria, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever, addiction, streptococcal therapy, and now, with the addition of staphylococcal blood disease, her blood has become a major camp for various antitoxins. In 1937, she heard that a child in Delaware was suffering from severe blood poisoning and was on the verge of death. She immediately rushed there and saved him with one dose of blood transfusion. Later, she was asked to go overnight from her summer travel camp and saved another child. On one occasion, she responded to an emergency call from a dental surgeon and braved a blizzard to fly from Akron to Chicago. On another occasion, she transfused blood to a woman in New York who was suffering from streptococcal endocarditis, and both mother and child were safe.</p>
<p>Her reputation grew larger and larger, and patients hoped that this life-saving Bodhisattva would descend from the sky when the doctors were helpless. She also generously flew around, distributing her precious blood. Sometimes, she was even rushed to two places at the same time, making it difficult for her to cope.</p>
<p>Mrs. McMullin is now calling herself the "Blood Transfusion King." She has donated a total of 200 doses of blood in three years. The loss of such a large amount of blood has not hindered her health in any way. After each blood transfusion, she never felt uncomfortable or had a headache. She does not have strict living and eating conditions, but her weight has increased by 15 pounds in the past three years. She is quite plump and looks very healthy. Only her cheeks are slightly pale, but she can cover it up with rouge.</p>
<p>Her husband, the late William McMullin, enthusiastically supports her life of saving people. He often proudly and incessantly tells people about his wife's story. He is a car salesman who can earn 40 to 50 yuan a week. Therefore, their blood transfusion purpose is not to make money. Mrs. McMullin claims that in the 200 blood transfusions, she has never received a penny of direct remuneration other than the necessary travel expenses. She once said generously: "It is extremely wrong to earn people's money." This noble sacrifice of compassion and selflessness is truly worthy of being written in large characters and praised.</p>

<h3>The Barrier of Life</h3>
<p>— Yu Fei</p>
<p>People start living from the moment they come out of their mother's womb. Although some people are saying with their eyes closed that there is no class distinction in this country, there are, after all, differences between rich and poor, noble and humble. Therefore, newborn babies either lie in the white cradles of high-end maternity hospitals, or they sleep in small, simple thatched sheds. The milk they suck, the air they breathe - the beginning of a person's life already has differences in quality.</p>
<p>The life of the rich is about eating well and dressing well. Beyond being well-fed and warm lies lust. Because there is "lust," there are prostitutes, guides, female dancers, female singers, male prostitutes, etc. To intensify the stimulation, there is jazz music, roulette, jai alai, horse racing, dog racing, nude performances, and "folk films"... As prices rise, the "life" of the rich aims at unrestrained consumption, so it seems even more lavish; and their money, although not brought from the umbilical cord, still comes from other places in a steady stream.</p>
<p>The life of the poor is about working from morning till night, from the beginning to the end of the year; the money workers earn every day is only enough to eat large pancakes, not enough to buy rice; farmers still have to rent rice to pay off grain taxes, leaving only a hungry belly. The children they give birth to are only sent to foundling hospitals or abandoned on the side of the road. If they get sick, they cannot afford to see a doctor or take medicine. If someone dies, they can only sleep in a white-board coffin provided by charity. Labor, hunger, poverty, disease, death... All the unfortunate names permeate their lives.</p>
<p>These two completely different kinds of lives are separated by the barrier of the social system. At the same time, the two kinds of lives are linked by relying on this social system. However, people ultimately have a desire to improve their lives; therefore, the rich want to maintain a wealthy life, and the poor want to break through their impoverished lives. When transformed into phenomena, they inevitably take on various forms: the rich say, "A person's poverty or wealth depends on fate." The poor believe this and begin to hate fate. The rich also say, "If you work hard and make progress, when good luck comes, the poor can also become rich!" The poor then believe in fate and work hard to "climb up"; but in fact, they have been greatly fooled, and they are destined to be slaves. They climb, climb, climb, hit a nail, and fall down. Touching the bump on their forehead, they can only lament fate again. After falling a few times, they may gradually understand: if the barrier of the social system is not removed, they will never be able to climb over it.</p>
<p>Our barrier is also intertwined with imperialism and feudal forces. To remove it, we must fight against these two forces.</p>
<h3>Easy Things to Do</h3>
<p>— Translated by Wu Jiqi</p>
<p>A young man wrote to me, asking me to find him an easy job. So, I replied, "You cannot be an editor; do not practice law; do not think of being a high official; do not go into business; you should also dislike political science; do not be a doctor; do not be a farmer, soldier, or sailor; and do not read; and do not think. Child, you have already stepped into this difficult reality, and nothing is easy. I know that there is only one place in the world that is incomparably comfortable, and that is the grave." (H.W. Beecher's Response)</p>
<p>Hawthorne's Case</p>
<h3>The Homecoming of the Dancing Queen</h3>
<p>— By Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Two People Caught</p>
<p>Hawthorne leaned back in his chair, clasping his right shin with both hands, his gaze fixed as if in deep thought, and replied, "Still difficult, but maybe there's something. Because this Li Shouqi recently came to Shanghai again and had a chat with Lilan. Are you aware of this?"</p>
<p>Anna shook her head and said, "I don't know. When did he come?"</p>
<p>"He arrived around lunchtime on the seventeenth of the month, stayed at Lilan's house overnight, and supposedly returned to Suzhou early in the morning of the eighteenth."</p>
<p>"Is that so? Why didn't Lilan tell me?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne then asked, "When was the last time you saw Lilan?"</p>
<p>Anna immediately replied, "Yesterday afternoon—around two o'clock. I went to her house to invite her to see the celebrity photo exhibition, but she declined. She didn't mention this matter at that time."</p>
<p>"Did she say anything to you, or did she show any unusual behavior?"</p>
<p>"I felt like she had something on her mind. She was lying on the sofa smoking a cigarette, told me she had a headache, and didn't say much. I asked her about it, but she didn't say anything. So, I didn't sit down for long and came back."</p>
<p>Hawthorne nodded, put down his right leg, and stood up, saying, "Miss Jiang, this matter is very complicated. There are many suspects in the case, and I haven't decided who it is yet. I will do my best. If I can solve it, I will notify you immediately."</p>
<p>Jiang Anna also understood that Hawthorne meant to see her out, so she picked up the blue leather folder on her lap and stood up gracefully. "Alright, thank you, Mr. Hawthorne."</p>
<p>She nodded to us again and was about to turn and walk out the door when Hawthorne called her back.</p>
<p>He said, "Miss Jiang, one more thing. Do you know where Lilan's money comes from?"</p>
<p>Jiang Anna stopped and paused for a moment. "Source of money? Naturally, it's Manager Lu. I know Little Yu doesn't spend money, and Lilan often makes clothes for him instead. That Mr. Zhao doesn't seem to have money either."</p>
<p>Hawthorne nodded. "Alright, I understand. Goodbye."</p>
<p>The sound of Jiang Anna's high heels had just faded out the door when, before I could even open my mouth to discuss this new development in the case with Hawthorne, Shi Gui suddenly ushered in two more people. One was Xu San, Ni Jinshou's assistant, and behind him was Yu Gantang. (127)</p>

<h3>### Shirley Temple's Whereabouts After Leaving the Film World</h3>
<p>— By Qinghui</p>
<p>Shirley Temple, who had dominated the film world for many years, has finally bid us farewell. Many people are nostalgic and eager to know about her life after leaving the film world. Now, according to foreign newspapers and magazines, a brief introduction is as follows:</p>
<p>Lovable</p>
<p>In appearance, Shirley hasn't changed much. She still has those curly hairs, but they are combed more neatly. Those two bright, black eyes, deep dimples, and a face as round and delicate as an apple, she is still a lovable child, kind and interesting, revealing childlike innocence and liveliness. At school, Shirley has a small difficulty, which is that her wealth invisibly isolates her from other children. She learned their ways, wore the same clothes as them, and was able to play with them, but she was still often unconsciously discovered to be different from them in terms of class status. Shirley was very troubled by this. She is quite interested in various outdoor sports, especially volleyball; her traces are often found in the library, and her favorite readings are biographies and anecdotes of celebrities; she studies diligently in the whole class, and although her grades are not amazing, her French and history are both excellent. She is also an experienced speaker, and in just a few months, she has won two speech competition awards.</p>
<p>King of Treats</p>
<p>Shirley is very generous. When she plays with her classmates, she is always the host, so she has the reputation of being the "King of Treats" among her companions. She often invites a few classmates to her home for a small tea party, sometimes studying loudly or playing volleyball, and when it's hot, going swimming.</p>
<p>She is, after all, a remarkable child prodigy. When she is in class, she listens attentively to the teacher's explanations; but after class, she squats next to the teacher, sits quietly for hours, without a word, or sometimes takes a walk to the open space, building a small bridge over a small ditch, or doing some childish things, even hitting the teacher a few times, but the teacher does not feel disgusted.</p>
<p>She often crosses her legs, chewing on pastries, and telling her classmates about her travels. Her experience is richer than that of an average adult. The most amazing thing is that everything seems ordinary to her. She believes that home is the most precious place in the world. Walking and chatting side by side with the country is not as fun as playing with naughty children. After Shirley left the film world, many people wanted to take the opportunity to seize her position, but like Valentino, her type cannot be filled by anyone else. Although she has left the film world, the letters sent from all over the world have not decreased. It is enough to show the audience's passionate love for her.</p>
<h3>### Bai Yang Stars in "Youth of China"</h3>
<p>— By Haixing</p>
<p>The youth of the isolated island fought on the front lines, in the rear, and in the heart of the motherland for three years! This should be a passionate heroic song. Playwright Yang Hansheng hopes to reflect this fact with a film and has written the screenplay for the film "Youth of China," which is now being directed by Su Yi of the China Film Studio, starring Bai Yang, Wei Heling, and Tao Yu. Yang Weiyun, the cinematographer from the Grand Hall of the Isolated Island, is in charge of filming.</p>
<p>Bai Yang was originally playing the lead role in the "Central One's" "Long Sky Miles," but because "Long Sky Miles" borrowed an outdoor photography studio from a "Chinese" suburb for filming, and the interior scenes were still being rushed to build, Bai Yang's outdoor work in "Youth of China" has already begun, and it is expected to be completed in four months.</p>
<p>"Youth of China" is a heroic song, an epic, and even more a mirror for young people! Telling you; the truth of the saying "China is the China of the Youth"!</p>
<h3>### Qilin Tong Still Needs Rest</h3>
<p>— By Yixing</p>
<p>Carlton Invites Shang Heyu</p>
<p>Qilin Shi, the president of the Yifeng Society, followed doctor's orders and decided to continue resting, so the day of Carlton's reopening is still far away. In order to maintain the livelihood of the backstage team, Carlton's management once considered inviting Huang Guiqiu or Zhang Yipeng to temporarily fill the gap, but both failed for various reasons. It is now learned that someone has been entrusted to invite Shang Heyu to the south for a short-term performance. Shang is an old performer of Peking opera, specializing in martial roles and excelling in short plays. He and the late Yang Xiaolou were known as the best. Although he is old, his waist and legs are still strong. In recent years, he often reappeared on stage with Shi Huibao, Xiao Changhua, Cheng Jixian, and others under the banner of the "Five Elders Association," and still gained praise. It is said that Shang Heyu is asking for eight thousand yuan, which is currently being negotiated. If it is successful, he will bring one sheng (male lead) and one dan (female lead). The painted-face role may be Guan Shaohua. As for Gao Baisui and Wang Xichun of the Yifeng Society, they will take a temporary break during this short period.</p>
<h3>Little Sheng</h3>
<p>Among the little sheng roles, Xu Xiaoxiang and below, Wang Guiguan, Lu Huaying, Zhu Suyun, De Junru, Cheng Lianxi, Jiang Miaoxiang, Jin Zhongren, Wang Youquan, Yu Zhenfei, etc., each got two level tones. The rising stars Ye Sheng'lan and Jiang Shiyu each got one level tone. Only Gao Weilian, with three characters and three level tones, has a very good voice and a tall stature. Please wait and see his future achievements to prove my point?</p>
<p>Among the martial sheng roles, the Yang father and son (Yuelou, Xiaolou, Jucheng, Zhenting) each got two level tones. Shang Heyu only has one level tone in the character "He." His art is comparable to Xiaolou, but his fate is not as good. The rising stars Gao (Shenglin), Wu (Yanheng), Yang (Shengchun), and Sun (Yukun) each got two level tones, so their art is equal and their names are equally known. There is even one Liu Zongyang with all three characters being level tones, but he is weak and lacks ambition. He is stuck in the yin level tone of the character "Zong." Compared to a fortune-telling sign, it is a medium sign. If he is willing to work hard in time, he can be successful in the future. (The three characters of Liu Zongyang have the same pattern as the three characters of Tan Xinpei, all being yang-yin-yang. This pattern is rare. The old Tan was not successful until he was in his thirties or forties, and he was extremely good in his old age.) There are very few old dan roles, such as Gong Yunfu, Wen Liangchen, and Li Duokui, all with two level tones. Wo Yun Jushi has two level tones in the four characters. The female old dan Zhang Shaoquan also has two level tones. Also, stage names like Yuanyuanhong (the original name of the bangzi old sheng Guo Baozhen, there is also a Little Yuanyuanhong) and Qilin Tong (Zhou Xinfang's original name) all have three yang level tones, so they can become famous in the opera world and establish their own style. I have verified this with many realities. The stage name with the most level tones is bound to have good luck. It is not a false statement. Only those with two yang and one yin in the middle, like Tan Xinpei, are the first class. Those with two yang on top and one yin below, like Mei Lanfang and Wang Yaoqing, are the second class. Those with three level tones all being yang, like Wang Quankui, Wang Changlin, and Wang Helin, are the third class. Those with one yin on top and two yang below, like Xiao Changhua and Gao Weilian, are another category. Names with only two level tones have the two ends being yang as the highest class, like Yu Shuyan, Yan Jupeng, and Wang Youchen. The next class has yang first and yin below, like Tan Fuyang, Yang Shisen, and Wu Suqiu. The next class has yin first and yang below, like Gao Qingkui and Wang Xiaonong. Those with both ends being yin are the next best, like Jin Shaoshan, Zhou Xiaotian, and Xin Yanqiu. Even my name, if I were to go into opera, I would have to change one or two characters, because the characters "Su" and "Qing," which are at both ends, are both yin level tones. This kind of pattern, even if you don't run errands, you will do the work. If compared to the official rank of the late Qing Dynasty, it would be in the unranked ninth rank. The salary received would be no more than five dou of rice, and the official name would be a kowtowing insect! If I change the middle oblique tone character "Shao" to the yang level tone character "Shao" (the character "Shao" has both level and falling tones), and change it to three level tones, I can be promoted several ranks. (A fortune teller named Yuan also looks at people's names to determine their fate. He doesn't talk about level tones, but looks at the shape of the characters. He roughly says that characters like "Xiao" (small) mean a small head and a small face, which is not generous. The character "Shao" (less) is even worse than the character "Xiao," because the character "Xiao" still stands there properly, while the character "Shao" is the character "Xiao" kicking its feet.) So, my character "Shao" must be changed. I will choose an auspicious day to change it. (The End)</p>
