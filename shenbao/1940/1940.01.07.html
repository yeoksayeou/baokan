<p>社評</p>
<h3>當前的地方自治問題</h3>
<p>去冬國民黨六中全會議決於今年召集國民大會，制定憲法，提早實施憲政，於是地方自治復成爲當前的問題。地方自治本是實行憲政的基礎，據蔣委員長在上屆參政會中所說明，在憲法頒布以後尙須繼續推進，何况正在積極籌備制憲期間的目前，當然必須致力於這一項基本工作？原來中國的地方自治，係以縣爲單位，故在制定憲法之前，先行訂立了「縣各級組織鋼要」、幷宣布今年三月開始實行地方自治。不但如此，且在戰時首都所在地的四川省，併經決定儘速施行，以作各省倡導。</p>
<p>從史的觀察中國地方自治，可以遠自黃帝的『經土設井』『立步制畝』說起，這太遠了。淸朝末年，地方自治當然亦是所謂『預備立憲』的題中應有之義；而民國初期的各級政制之中，更是少不了地方自治的雛形；因循點綴，瞬息皆空。及民國十八年以後的三五年中，中央與地方政府亦嘗一度以努力推進地方自治爲要務，但實際成績，祇做到了劃分自治區域與籌備自治機關兩事。、正因爲地方自治是憲政的初步工作而不是起碼工作，是基本工作而不是粗淺工作，完成大不易；何况正在國步維艱，橫逆迭乘之中</p>
<p>近年的地方自治而爲目前所値得比較取捨的：（一）民國二十一年，由南昌行營通令剿匪區內各省先行舉辦保甲，以爲治標方策，其他各省亦相率倣效；以致原有的推行自治工作，反而逐漸緩弛，結果所至，自治與保甲形成對峙狀態。保甲制度要在辦理地方警衛，而據前立法院訂正的縣自治法規定，則縣警衛治安事項爲縣自治要政之一；所以保甲原爲自治的一部分，理應容納保甲於自治組織之中；現在「縣各級組織綱要」中規定保甲附於鄕鎭編制之內，意即在此。時論或以爲保甲制利於管人，不必利於管事；自治階層太多，辦事不免窒礙，不知在抗戰期間，敵騎所至，往往閭閻爲墟，鄕村小民勢難如承平時代膠着一隅，如將保甲與自治組織打成一片，則不惟國家徵兵比較容易，且甲地人民飄泊至於乙地，仍可隨時組織，不爲地域所限。此係辦理戰時地方自治的必要條件，不容輕視。</p>
<p>（二）國民政府前曾組織中央地方自治計劃委員會，由該會訂定自治施行的程序爲（甲）扶植自治，（乙）自治開始、（丙）自治完成等三時期。在第一時期，縣市長依法由政府任命，設縣市參議會。鄉鎭村長等由各本區人民選舉三人，由縣長擇一委任。在第二時期，縣市長仍由政府任命，縣市會議議員及鄕鎭長等皆由人民選舉。在第三時期，所有上述人員皆爲民選。但各地情形不同，環境逈異，尤其在軍事期間，有所謂淪陷區，游擊區及安全區之分，中央自只宜爲富有彈性的規定，俾得因地因時而制宜。即如自治區域的劃分問題，對於自治工作的推進，關係最稱密切，在劃分之先，當然須就地理歷史風土人情交通物產等等作整個的規畫。凡此措施在理論上，似非戰時所能輕舉，但有許多地方，正因戰事影響，交通阻梗，人民流離，若此種自治區域一仍舊貫，將無異於「閉門造車譬如代淪陷區人民謀自治，豈非滑稽？欲圖補救，似應由行政專員及縣長就近調查，妥爲修正，其關於鄕鎭長等的選舉事宜，亦不能不由專員縣長等，呈准上級機關，派遣曾受訓練人員爲自治指導員，馳赴各地，分別指導。</p>
<p>（三）民十七年的縣組織法，係採區，鄕鎭，閭鄰等四級制度，階層太多！推行困難，且區與鄕鎭的事務，類多重複，疊床架屋，自屬無謂。最近「縣各級組織綱要」定爲鄉鎭一級，足矯此弊，其將保甲附於鄕鎭編制之內，允合戰時需要，已如上述。但此種種，尙僅爲原則上的規定，除劃分自治區域外，如何淸查戶口，辦理人事登記，如何整理土地核定地價；如何將中央委辦事項與地方固有事項兼籌並顧；如何籌措自治經費。凡此種種，必須數管齊下，相輔而行；其事本非簡單，何况地方諸夫安定，困難更甚。猶憶去年二月初，頗傳中央對於各地，擬議（一）恢復游擊戰區內的行政機構，（二）對於各省市縣政府組織實行軍事化，（三）選拔優秀靑年，參加改進地方行政工作，（四）設立各省地方行政幹部人員訓練所。這幾項計畫，或已行，或未辦，吾們深感於實行地方自治，還以此爲入手必要之方。</p>
<h3>美兩黨議員鼓吹　對日實施嚴厲制裁　主張禁止軍火原料輸日　務使日本停止對華侵略</h3>

<p>新閣員鄧根賴資皆非國會議員、但衆料彼等不久將在下院中獲有議席、聞首相原擬請倍利夏担仔商相，但倍利夏未接受之、政府經此变更後重要位置之重行支配、現已完畢、惟次要位置稍緩或尙有更動、史丹萊將繼倍利夏而加入戰時內閣、惟商相與情報部大臣則不在戰時內閣之內、史丹萊目前患　流行感冒病、尙未能到部視事、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　據路透社國會訪員聲稱、陸相倍利夏之辭職、出於何因、當然仍多廣泛之猜度、惟負責方面不願遽下斷語、仍傳全局較明朗後、再發意見、至於今晨各報所載之種種建議、當知陸軍省各高級人員今皆負有重責、故無暇對於此種建議加以評論、首相張伯倫現定下星期二日在倫敦市長邸發表演說、屆時將吾述及陸相辭職事、尙屬疑問、或將延至一月十六日國會重行集議時言之、屆時倍利夏本人將吾在下院有所陳述、亦未可必、因倍氏已切實聲明渠與首相對於政策之意見、並無歧異也、事有須注意者、即倍利夏致首相之函、已明白表露彼此對於奮力進行戰事以達勝利目的一點、毫無參商問題是也、（六日路透電）</p>

<h3>緬甸訪華團訪問　中國這次英勇抗戰獲最後勝利可一躍而成世界大同運動領袖</h3>
<p>重慶航訊，緬甸訪華團宇巴倫等一行丸人，抵渝以來，即運日忙於參觀及赴宴，讚揚與感謝一類的詞語。巳暖熱了這座冬天的山城。可是，他們對於我們的觀感具體說來到底是怎樣呢？這是大家需要知道的問題。記者特於該團行將離渝飛蓉的前夕，作了一次臨別前的訪問。</p>
<p>在白衣侍者持片走上樓去兩分鐘之後，樓梯上就嚮着急促而愉快的脚步聲。脚步聲在記者的面前停止了，然而記者迷惑了——站在記者前面幷與記者熱烈握手爲禮的不再是纏着花綢頭巾穿着對襟緬服的緬甸朋友，而是男的却穿着藍夾袍，黑馬褂，女的（都彌亞辛女士）也是中國國產製的黑絲絨長旗袍，</p>
<p>「怎麽樣？不認得了麼？團長宇巴倫說着笑着，彷彿久別重逢的老友似的，手也握得、更緊了「這是蔣委員長送我們的。」天眞樸摯的他，此刻也略微顯得有些驕傲了，</p>
<p>「你們很忙吧？上午參觀那里，下午參觀這里的。」記者把話頭轉向本題來。</p>
<p>「是的，我們每個人都興奮得很。我們來到貴國，僅僅八九天工夫，可是我們所學習幷體騐到的東西，就起碼超過了以前的任何一個八九年。」於是大家便盡情地各自暢所欲言了。</p>
<p>首先，他們對中國的精誠團結表示了最大的快慰與希望。他們說這是由於我們有着蔣委員長的英明領導使然的。蔣委員長把我們中華全民都團結到他的周圍，給中國奠定了一個鞏固的基礎，在道一基礎上，全國一致向着光明幸福的前途邁進。</p>
<p>這樣的一個中國，她將來所能賜予於她的同是愛好和平的鄰國的有力帮助，這該是我們兩國人民所共願共信的。中緬文化協會的今天在重慶成立，等於剛剛給中緬兩國打好了一個基礎，我們是要好好地造起房子來，把兩國的思想文化發揚而光大，他們又說，中緬文化協會的成立，是他們此行許多寳貴收穫中的最寳貴的一個。</p>
<p>對於中國的工商業——在抗戰中日益健壯强大起來的工商業，他們也表示了他們熱烈的敬佩：「在我們沒有參觀貴國的造船業之前，我們簡直連想也不會想到一切有關抗戰建國的機械都是貴國自造的。」</p>
<p>對於中國的敎育文化——在日本野心侵略，百般推殘下的敎育文化，他們認爲足以使人興膏，更足引爲法式。尤其是中國的新聞界，在抗戰中也表現了它的艱苦而光榮的使命。各地報館多數曾被日機炸燬，然而他們的回答是用更有力的方式繼續奮鬥，沒有一刻或懈。貢獻他們的報導天職。在緬從事新聞工作廿年，一向爲中國的抗戰仗義執言的宇巴倫，又再提及他的中緬新聞界合作辦法：經常聯系，相互提供資料。因了他的要求，此間各報聯合委員會曾給緬甸新聞界寫了一封公開信，宇巴倫除了願作帶此「佳音」人，幷且願繼續以揭破日本在緬甸的虛僞宣傳爲己任。</p>
<p>副團長都彌亞辛女士，則一再對中國婦女界的英勇表示欽佩。他說；這的確是極切需要的事實，婦女要爭取獨立。自由·平等，首先必須國家民族獲得澈底解放，而國家民族的澈底解放，一半的責任則在於佔人類半數的婦女。緬甸和中國的婦女，在文化上藝術上各方面都應建立起密切的聯擊，幷且交換她們爲祖國獨立自由而奮鬥的經騐敎訓。</p>
<p>中國生活在緬旬的華僑，人數超過三十萬，佔全緬人口總數的百分之四十。由於他們的人格高尙與吃苦耐勞，都給予了緬甸人士以很好印象及影響。團長宇巴倫，要證明這是實情遝講了句笑話：「要是不然的話，怎麽緬甸女子會多數願嫁給中國人呢？」</p>
<p>旅緬華僑，對於祖國抗戰的舉動，首先是號召全印緬的人士抵制日貨，繼則成立「中緬佛敎聯合會」用中緬兩種文字散發新聞的「中國時事通訊社，」此外幷聯合全緬十三個慈善機關，成立一個「緬甸救災總會」，專給中國捐助翳藥和金錢，計巳匯華現款達六百萬盾了。華僑婦女們還成立一個「國際婦女協會」，做種種有關抗戰的工作。她們在這兩年多抗戰期中，會舉行三百六十次「中國飯」的義賣，即以外人所歡喜吃的中國烹調來換取友邦人士的捐款，彙寄中國抗戰，成績殊爲可觀。</p>
<p>總之，在中國爲了獨立自由而奮鬥三個年頭，幷已獲得勝利的基礎的情勢之下，所有日本軍閥在緬甸方面進行的一切政治·經濟·文化·甚至在交通上的陰謀詭計，緬甸人民都早巳給了牠們以無情的回答，今後當然更不會有絲毫的客氣或讓步。中國的英勇抗戰之終極目的，乃在奠定世界和平基石。因此，中國道决英勇抗戰，不僅可以獲得勝利，不僅可以建立一個偉大光輝的强國，幷且可以一躍而成爲世界大同運動的一個領袖。</p>
<p>客廳里的燈光，此刻顯得特別明亮，牠與興奮的人的面孔交換着光芒。然而時間已不早了，我們依依吿別時，宇巴倫還替一位同業用緬文題了這麼幾句話，借來以作結束：</p>
<p>「倘若一雙飛烏，在金籠子內，仍然不慰快的話：那末，一個國家，在他國統制之下。又怎能慰快呢？」</p>
<h3>南田縣珠門一帶　日兵再度騷擾</h3>
<p>南田通訊、上月十九日、本縣花岙洋面、有日艦一艘、放下汽艇在本縣金高椅企圖登陸、當被華軍自衛隊擊退、詎翌晨、日艦續以小汽艇三艘、載兵四十餘名、再度窺犯金高椅、自衛隊據報、當即分頭迎擊、激戰三小時後、日兵不得逞、日艦乃駛泊內港、發砲十餘發、猛烈轟擊、另行掩護日兵八十餘名在珠鬥等處偷渡登陸、竄至龍泉鎭挨戶搜索、至下午三時、自衛隊援軍開到、奮勇反攻、激戰一小時許、日兵始倉皇遁回原艦、是役、華方士兵死傷三人、下落不明者二、日兵死傷十餘人、屍體均被拖回原艦、啟椗他駛、</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<p>其尤足出人意表之外、當以昨日暴徒圖擊費氏一案為最、蓋費氏平時奉公守法、態度和藹、各方對之、均頗具好感、該暴徒竟爾出此、殊令人不明其襲擊之緣因何在、茲將各情分誌如次、</p>
<p>清晨遇險千多一髪</p>
<p>費氏於昨晨九時十五分許、乘自備汽車四一六零號、由車夫吳金根駕駛外出、其時有兩人力車夫正徘徊於四九三號門前、及見費氏汽車駛出、兩車夫即自白賽仲路對面朱家庫衖竄出、曳其人力車故意於費車駛至面前時、突佯作奔穿馬路之狀、當即高呼、詎料該人力車夫仍向前奔跑、其中一名停於費氏汽車之前、攔住車身、另一名則駛至汽車左旁、其所拖車輛、即與費氏汽車碰撞、而該喬裝人力車夫即乘此費氏車夫不備之際、突然拔出手槍向費氏開放一響、費氏猝聞槍聲、急加閃避、嗣該暴徒復連續開槍三響、終以該暴徒瞄準技術欠佳、雖先後四彈、費氏幸未受傷、</p>
<p>兇手卸裝倉惶逃逸</p>
<p>暴徒連續放槍四響後、具時費氏之車夫吳金根履險如夷、已將其汽車由兩輛人力車環阻之狀態中、立將車旋轉避出向前疾駛、故費氏汽車雖受彈痕、費氏及其汽車夫均告無恙、兇手見汽車夫開足速率駛去後、續有槍聲發出、達十餘響、密如聯珠、嗣乃奔入朱家庫衖、逃入附近草舍中、倉皇卸去其車夫服裝、據另一消息、兇手曾為該處附近新新娛樂塲保鑣者張某所擒獲、經解至該處特務機關、但經各方調查、以該處對此事始終保守緘默、故被拘暴徒究在何處、現時尚未能獲得證明、</p>
<p>費氏汽車中彈八處</p>
<p>此不可理解之驚人鉅案發生後、費利浦氏脫險到局循例處理要公、旋即由費氏偕捕房探捕赴肇事地點砌查當檢獲彈壳九顆、至費氏坐車則檢得所受彈痕亦有八處之多、而該兩人力車所裝置之租界照會、聞係出於偽造、於此足證暴徒對此事殆已早有陰謀、現公共租界及法租界捕房對本案極為重視、正竭力進行值查、當即可獲得綫索也、</p>
<p>暴徒目標尚待判明</p>
<p>據悉、兇手於突擊費氏之前、曾於六日清晨四時許即徘徊於費氏寓邸前後、昨晨開放手槍之暴徒、雖僅兩人、但同時在該處附近望風者、計達六七人之該多、暴徒在開槍之前、曾向費氏注視、故可知其襲擊目標、當為一西僑、但渠雖對費氏注視、而是否其行兇目標、即為費氏、尚未能判明、蓋未知暴徒於開槍之前、是否已確實認明為費氏本人、而再加襲擊耳、</p>
<p>中外人士紛紛慰問</p>
<p>費氏突被暴徒襲擊之消息傳出後、中外各界領袖、先後前往工部局慰問者、絡繹不絕、費氏雖受虛驚、然仍照常治事、態度極為鎮定、費氏夫人在其寓邸直至午刻獲悉其夫脫險經過、曾對往訪賓客、表示忻慰、並中謝友好馳往慰問之熱忱與關心、據悉、費氏未悉有何寃仇、此次有人向其襲擊、動機何在、未能臆測、另據費氏語合衆社記者謂、彼自信無敵人、故對此事毫無提防、</p>
<p>西報所載暴徒被捕</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、工部局總辦兼總裁費利浦、今（六日）晨自海格路六三三號寓所乘汽車赴局辦公、突遭喬裝黃包車赴局徒三人開鎗狙擊、發鎗不下八響、但汽車夫頗為機警、驟聞鎗聲兩響、開足速率、疾馳而去、故費氏及車夫、均未受傷、嗣悉三暴徒行兇後已在海格路某衖被捕、公共租界警務處刻圖拘押該三暴徒到案、但截至午後為止、被捕暴徒究在何處、仍屬疑團、駐滬英軍司令西蒙斯少將、對此英軍防區內企圖暗殺英人事、已向日憲兵當局提出抗議、此案經過如下、費氏於今晨九時十五分甫離海格路寓所、即有喬裝黃包車夫之暴徒三人、自白賽仲路對面朱家庫衖竄出、第一暴徒擬將人力車曳至途中、狙塞汽車去路、第二暴徒則出鎗開放、汽車夫開足速率駛去時、兩人復開數鎗、然後飛奔入朱家庫弄、又開鎗兩響示威、逃入附近草舍中易去車夫服裝、附近新新賭塲武裝保鑣聞及鎗聲、即入草舍加以擒獲、嗣經警務處查悉、暴黨共六人、參加鎗擊之三暴徒和得人力車時、即送原車夫入茶肆品茗、三暴徒出發狙擊、其餘三人在旁把守、按英大使寇爾爵士前聞有人謀刺之說、乃請警務處予以特殊保護、大使本人亦身穿鋼絲馬甲、並有警員兩名充保鑣、到處隨行大使、旋得防彈汽車一輛、配有厚玻璃等設備、以策萬全、</p>

<p>民食協會集團購米</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向關係方面探悉、關於調節滬市民食問題、（一）集團訂米、由民食協會辦理、（二）辦理平糶事宜、由平糶委會辦理、關於平糶之進行已見上述、關於集團購米、已由民食協會辦理訂米登記、各團體機關公司行號工廠、申請訂購者甚為擁擠、首批六百噸、已電西貢訂購、將於本月底以前運抵上海、第二批即將續電西貢訂購、銀錢兩業對於集團訂米、已允予以墊款、</p>
<p>市塲米價已趨穩定</p>
<p>上海之米糧、自經民食調節協會及平糶委員會集團訂購洋米、及籌款辦理平糶後、市塲人心已安、搶米之風絕跡、豆米行業茶會市塲、米價已趨穩定、同時兩租界當局對維持民食取締投機抱有極大決心、於是一般均不敢再行操縱囤積、此外洋米源源運滬、除已運抵上海外、尚有八萬包、將於一月十五日前運到、連日因外匯轉鬆、續訂洋米者甚多、故此後滬市民食、可無虞矣、</p>

<h3>日本鋼鐵恐慌　在華搜羅鐵料　江南造船所存鐵悉被刦　商辦鐵廠機件亦遭搜掠</h3>
<p>中日鏖戰兩年半後、日方在國內之鋼鐵、消耗殆盡、故在中國淪陷區內積極搜羅銅鐵鋼等金屬、不遺餘力、近復進一步組絹所謂「製鐵株式會社」、專門收買鐵件機關、利用無賴等四出活動、足見日方鋼鐵恐慌、已達極點、茲誌各情如下、</p>
<p>江南存鐵被刦一空</p>
<p>高昌廟國營江南造船所、戰時存有大批鐵件、因笨重未及移出、致落日方之手、初則將該廠更名三菱造船所、開工修理日方毀損船艦、繼因日軍在前綫消耗軍火數量過鉅、國內鐵料日見缺乏、故江南造船所中之存鐵、被搬移一空、即戰時藏於大馬山麓之一部份鐵件、亦被移去、故江南造船所受損害殊重、</p>
<p>商辦鴻昌受害亦重</p>
<p>詎日方再接再厲、於去歲成立所謂製鐵株式會社」、大規模收羅鐵件、且進一步凱覦純粹商人所設之鐵廠內鐵件、以圖彌補其鐵荒、據查南市商辦鴻昌鐵廠內之大批機件鐵料、亦被該「製鐵株式會社」收羅而去、嗣經該廠發覺、輾轉設法報請偽機關查究、結果僅推在無賴胡福海王興安唐角洲三人頭上、謂該廠全部機件鐵料、即被此三人盜賣於『製鐵會社』、得洋三千六百元逃逸、無法追究等情、塞責了事、</p>
<p>另在吳淞設堆鐵塲</p>
<p>日方在江南各處羅致所得之鐵件、本堆於楊樹浦齊物浦路偽「魚市塲」旁荒地上、現因該處為衆目昭彰之地、有所不便、另在呈淞溫藻浜北首、闢一荒地、堆置鐵料、再用運輸艦改泊吳淞浦面、陸續將鐵件運回本國應用、故近數月來、楊樹浦一帶不再發見日運輸艦在該處裝運鐵料、亦即此故、</p>

<h3>葡萄糖鈣反應問題　被吿答辯理由</h3>
<p>本報昨日刊載「注射葡萄糖鈣、發生强烈反應」一稿、茲據被吿吳志衛君之代理雜師阿樂滿氏補充答辯理由如下、</p>
<p>逕啟者、茲據當事人吳志衛君聲稱、頃閱本日申報載有郁廷襄醫師自訴鄙人過失傷害之新聞一則、其內容偏重於自訴人方面之陳述、而對於鄙人方面之答辯、略而不詳、且將本案若干重要事實、漏未列入、誠恐一般公衆、滋生誤會、應予補充如下、</p>
<p>（一）本件刑事自訴、乃係在郁醫師要求賠償損害、經鄙人據理拒絕之後、而提起刑訴、換言之、如鄙人常初不顧事理曲直、委曲求全、允予賠償、則郁臀師根木不致提起刑訴、但鄙人理直氣壯、當然不甘屈服、</p>
<p>（二）郁醫師起訴主，要理由、所以認鄙人為有過失者、無非謂美國普强公司並非Ameriean　Medical　Association之會員、故鄙人不應經銷其出品而已、但該會乃美國臀師公會、則製藥廠商根本不必目亦不能加入、故其起訴理由、實巳大錯特錯、</p>
<p>（三）普强公司出品之　葡萄糖鈣、行銷全球、聲譽卓著、如郁臀師認該公司出品爲不應使用、當初又何以驟用於其病人之身、父何以於隔數日後、重行用於自己之身、且該藥如果確屬不妥、則何以直至本案審理時、郁醫師仍不能提出任何化騐證據、以證明其主張、</p>
<p>（四）郁臀師因自己傷風咳嗽、而注射葡萄糖鈣、是否有當、已成問題、且注射針藥時、是否緩急合度、是否消毒週密、在在均有關係、今將强公司之藥、事實上已可證明絕無瑕疵、則郁醫師所述之反應、其發生原因何在、還應請郁臀師自行研究、</p>
<p>查本案現經辯論終結、將由法院於本月十一日宣告判決、鄙人深信公理自在人心、是非不難大白、現在本無再辯之必要、但因該項報載新聞、易予公衆以不確之印象、應請吿律師代函該報館請予補充更正等語前來、據此、合代函達、即希查照辦現、爲荷、此致申報館、阿樂滿律師、二十九年一月六日、庭論候公示送達</p>

<h3>金融　外滙兔起鶻落　英金五辦士出而復入　美滙重復退入八元關</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况匯豐掛牌揭曉、一致放長、英金計大二五、爲四便士半、美匯計長半元、爲七元三七五、英美匯暗市、起伏　定、實爲最近所罕見、原以最近市上謠　繁興、致人心忐　、趨勢初　繼則劇緊、前後反應極烈、常日過程、晨開因美英滙兌轉長、遂告英緊美平之象、嗣承上日之賣風餘威、復加和平空氣之遍播、誠使不少華商多頭驚惶失措、紛紛斬結、更有港電亦來吐出、而外行買意極淡、一時頭寸充斥、未逾半小時、英金已出五便士關口、達五便士〇三一二五、美滙亦喊過八元三一二五、不意此後空穴來風、謂財政部行將發印金庫券之舉、時見滙豐突來乘賤猛進、有利亦結、而華銀行亦代某大戶同時開始在扒、洋行界及一部份華商亦見景跟買、而外行賣意奇淡、是以跟風作動者、不知其數、故回風甚烈、市面混亂不堪、迄至收盤、英金祇四便士七八一二五、美匯僅七元八一二五、結果比上日英緊一八七五、美軟二八一二五、期貨潛勢、仍與現貨相同、</p>
<p>華商紛向期貨活動</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近期漲二五、遠期長一八七五、綢的銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美對法均平、對滬升二五、美對英昂八七五、對滬長三角牛、對法大六二五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四便士九三七五、美匯八元〇九三七五、較前收英緊〇三一二五、美則無榮辱、乃匯兌回長之故、開後港電首來塞三、且一般投機商復來斬多、故市勢續形步硬、迨至九時二十五分、英金已出五便士關口、達五便士〇三一二五、美滙亦長至八元三一二五、匯豐掛牌揭曉、英金放長二五、美滙掛大半兀、白銀平衛稅揭曉大一分二五、此後市象突形轉變、因滙豐先後吸進現先令五便士及現美金八元二五、是以遂引起洋行界前來猛扒、且外行有利及華行國華大陸等亦紛向現期活動、加之投機商等已中止拋出、而外行如大通某行等雖有供意、但莫不乘勢扳價、故回風頗烈、迨至十時廿分、英金已回入五便士關、退達四便士丸〇六二五、美滙亦縮至八元關口、嗣後再加有一部份華商亦來跟踪扒進、致情况繼續步緊、直至收盤、亳無回顧、銀行現貨賣價英全僅四便士七八一二五、美滙祇匕元八一二五、下月期英金四便士七五、美滙七元七五、結果比上日現期英悉回緊一八七五、美俱回軟二八一二五、午後週六無市、</p>

<h3>利多利空各有其辭　金價跌後反動劇漲　四千元關險遭破入　金券之謠頓起回風</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、以環境突又轉佳、雖初開尙吿軟弱、遽因匯市忽轉奇緊、多方虛張聲勢、揑造空氣、致使一般空頭心思者裏足不前、而蓄意扒進之戶、則開始在拖、籌碼時感枯竭、故結果竟反軋漲五十九元、至晨初因匯市尙現鬆勢、且和平本氣仍難消散、人心萎靡不振、允以散戶都懷賣意、爭先拋空、致開價即暴落四十三元、爲叫千零一十元、續以再跌二十元、退達四千元低盤、迨此後匯市急韓緊縮、更以其時財政部行將發印金庫券之說、重囂於市、遂使買戶精神一振、證券帮某銀號及某二大錢兌業先後代本港等劃猛購、加之浮空抵補益切、雖某金號尙來拋賣、但終寡不敵衆、價遂飛躍上漲、四千一百二十五元高價、遂於午收前出現、結果以叫千一百二十二元收盤、午後塲內無市、而塲外初仍堅俏、續漲數元、達四千一百三十元、後以某、號復來塞出、且銀樓劃亦有供意、致遂回落、聞最後價已降至四千一百十元左右、至上午成交的二千兩光景、銀樓飾金回大五元、海關全等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤回漲五九元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開依然散漫無勁、因外匯續硬、有一部份浮戶拋空頗切、加之進者觀望、開市即猛撳四十一三元、錢兌業出全號二十兩、爲四千零二十元、少頃於賣風下再小二十元、錢兌業互做二十兩、爲四千元、詎料此時匯市突吿回緊、買氣陡濃、價即立刻橫跳、一霎那已漲起五十五元、金號進證券帮三十兩、爲叫千零五十五元、時證券帮塞出百餘兩、且銀樓帮亦有賣三、故一度又撳小至叫千零三十元、此後證券帮某號力進、同時錢兌業亦來收買、復拉至四千零五十五元、嗣後某金號猛塞二百餘兩、一時漲風又被壓住、再降達四千零三十五元、旋因外匯緊勢頗烈、買風瀰漫、某二錢兌業力代客帮搜購、加之某銀號及證券帮亦爭先在拖、且售者大都束手、不久即飛躍六十七元出四千一百大關、設券帮進錢兌業十兩、爲叫千一百零二元、其時金號又賣、錢兌業亦稍回吐、頓又退達四千零八十元、此後終因匯市繼續趨緊、重又激動買風、某錢兌業又代本港帮收買、同時證券帮亦放盤搜購、加以浮空抵補、遂再飛漲四十五元、錢兌業進證券帮二十兩、爲四千一百二十五元、後錢兌業吐予金號十兩、爲四千一百二十二元、　午收價、結果比上日回漲五十九元、半天一百二十五元上落現金號之本牌金售出價照烚赤較高數元、收進减低二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘兀，均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金亦掛大五元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸四百十元、迨至十一時　大五元、此後無變化、結果大同行改懸四百十五元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低十五元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣波瀾正多</h3>
<p>昨日外幣變化頗劇、先因供給暢盛、市况鬆濫、繼而謠言繁興、說金幣券將發行、需要驟殷、市况堅挺、英美金鎊回漲甚勁、美金票上午曾跌至十二元二角、英余票跌至四十五元、倏而轉漲有力、晚市美金票升爲十二元八角三分、英金票升爲四十五元八角、港票法郎票亦先疲後堅、結果俱軋漲甚多、坎票斐票需要頗殷、市價昂貴、日金票市况軟弱、晚市爲一元三角六分五厘、朝鮮續疲、晚市爲一元零九分、昨日市價、英美金鎊俱升一元五角、英金票升八角、美金票升四角六分、香港票升四分、法郎票升五厘、坎拿大票升二角、斐律濱票升一角、其他各幣未更、</p>
<h3>證券　內外債券　續見高翔</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨市仍頗良好、丙種居然衝出五十元大關、乙種又穿出二元關、形勢頗稱優良、惟連日上漲後、一般浮多有利可圖、有相當了結、故市價稍有曲綫、和平空氣仍甚濃厚、但似係出於某方之心願、觀於淪陷區之標語及正金倫教分行經理之談話可知、此外則宋氏又有上臺之說、和平之來、當不在遠、市價雖有曲折、依市塲人心及環境情形論之、終以上漲成份爲多、因買戶多數屬於金融界也、上午交易十六號及大豐買進最爲踴躍、鴻大恒孚聯益買進亦不弱、潤利聯和久豐皆有多頭結出、同順又進甲出內、餘則散戶了結亦茶多、丙種曾達五十元〇三角、乙種曾至五十二元半、後以浮多出籠、稍稍回低、下午三十八號及大豐進量仍鉅、聯益聚鑫及恒孚亦有買進、但浮多因金子突好、斬割甚湧、丙種重進五十元關、結果仍略好　角半至二角半、成交總數的一百十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交國華銀行股三十股、價爲五十元止、</p>
<p>倫教五日電、今日中國外債掛牌行市、又吿平定、上下檔各法券均無變動、</p>
<p>倫敦五日電、今日英商遠東各公司股票掛牌行市、銀行股續吿上升、麥加利銀行升一失令三便士、爲八鎊十五先令、匯豐銀行股續升一鎊、英倫註冊股八十四鎊半、香港註冊股爲八十六鎊半、其餘吿平、</p>
<p>昨日衆業公所股市、活潑激昂、至於極點、大衆注意力、仍集中於橡皮股、而實業方面多種亦現新高價、晨初交易最旺、價格步騰、嗣因獲利者競起了結、低價橡皮股之漲勢乃受頓挫、收盤市况極堅、各被愛　嚴、其收盤價　列如下、</p>
<h3>糧食　食米銷塲呆滯</h3>
<p>斛盤續貶二三角</p>
<p>粳尖　米自前午一度轉緊後、昨早開手尙有餘波、續呈好面、乃以內地來源若南港早晚稻聞又有難以合運之說、及抵虹口轉出者寥寥無幾、一般客飯遂視手中各貨有機可乘、不肯輕脫、而購進者認爲隔昨一綫向榮希望、續有採辦之意、多所問津、因是各貨在售方扳喊乏間、初曾一度兒昂、迨至中市突有虹口轉出早晚稻在市拋售者不下一二千包、且大批洋米亦跟踪直追、無論期現貨一律湧出、致銷塲雖佳、卒乏巨胃吸收、市貨頓呈供求不勻、購進者難免心餒、反現觀望、霎時去路回滯、售者欲求脫手、至此惟有甩價一途、所以轉瞬跌風立起、無論粳尖國米與各色洋米均已貶落二三角之譜、然後終覺人心難挽、無大收效、結果早晚稻晨間曾喊三十七元、收盤僅三十六元四五角、西貢初爲三十六元半、後祇三十六元一二角而已、</p>
<p>洋米　存底充塞、來源接連、邇日除西貢直接運滬外、香港方面亦常有零整到埠、而平糶之　號西貢及碎米等亦將全部到申、不日即將開糶、且决米與碎米等定價尙能通劃、因此行舖作客均乏暢胃、昨日交易不足三千包、一號西貢已回至三十六元三五角、决至三十五元、碎米高三十一元八角、次則回小至二十九元二角、比之前市已小去三五角云、</p>
<h3>麵粉穏定　小麥仍俏</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨粉市續吿平穩、查本客銷塲、因値週末、動而不暢、且津帮及港帮前辦之貨、尙在報運中、本街年貨需用尙早、面廠方以洋麥雖已訂購、成本依然高昂、不願加工生產、祇肯隨產隨銷、故成交總額不足三萬包、　號紛廠盤續開九元、兵船牌回籠貨價在九元三角半、祿砲車客盤仍須九元五角、市面脚地尤穩、日廠粉交易不旺、一月份鳳凰牌開價九元〇三四分、結果亦盤旋於九元一角左右、查麵粉今日有一萬〇九百五十包、運往厦門、又三千包運往香港、</p>
<p>小麥　麥市依然堅俏、蓋目下內地本麥產價旣高、供源久乏、各廠雖定洋麥、恐來源亦需相當時日、且核價終比本麥爲高、是以執貨者仍堅持、不願輕易求脫、致行情反見秀色、蘇州白麥價開十五元五角半、無錫常州麥十五元五角、浦東麥十五元四角、計出福新廠辦去一千包、阜豐辦去二千包、</p>
<h3>紗花　服多痛斬　紗價慘跌</h3>
<p>雙馬最低到七二一元</p>
<p>紗市續挫、且跌風奇熾、此因海外棉市轉跌、粵北大捷、外匯放長益厲、一般浮多心慌、在市紛粉斬結、同時實需依然沉悶而乏生氣、買者又吿缺乏、對於一二月份之雙馬紗變相的投機工具、賣氣大熾、市情愈形不支、二十支雙馬一度曾慘落至七百二十一元、旋即近十一時半、聞外匯轉縮、一鼓驚愕之氣、略見消散、然實際生意太滯也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開因海外之材料、利於缺方、加之匯市消息要長、塲中散漫乏勁、二十支雙馬開價爲七百三十元、即跌十元、繼聞匯票鬆懈益勁、跌風續盛、一度曾見七百二十一元、塲中一二月份之期貨買賣、熱鬧非凡、迨至收盤時又復回升、以外匯改緊之故也、二十支燮馬回至七百二十八元收盤、查半日間成交統計一千六百包、行情二十支雙馬跌十三元、雙地球跌十五元、天女跌十五元、今日有棉紗二百零五件運香港、三十件運海口、一百件運海防、一百十五件運厦門、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<h3>日廠動辦　棉銷起色</h3>
<p>本棉交易又趨活動、同行買賣尤覺起色、靑島方面需要殷切、本埠生意尙屬次之、昨成交之數、復成信買去佔百分之五十左有此貨大都運往北路之用、開時上海日廠亦有採辦、於是棉市仍形穩定、但美棉又見下風、惟即棉尙在緊昂之途、蘇北來源、計通花五千八百七十包、常陰沙一千六百七十七包、北沙來一千七百五十包、茲將現棉做開狀况列左、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日晨初市况甚爲挺秀、因海外各方在市購買、因之價格上漲、後因南方帮之套賣、及多頭之了結、市况因而轉疲、結果收盤價格較之上日又跌十磅音、印度連同預測跌四羅比、埃及漲六十餘磅音、利物浦漲二十餘便士、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、各方俱以匯兌之變化過巨、且各種謠言之紛起、故各同業均不敢貿然購買、廠方亦以紗價慘落、無意進取、故全日交易異常靜寂、茲將昨日棉市以美匯八元折合送廠價如下、</p>
<h3>油市　豆油行市挫落</h3>
<p>昨日豆油市况、因大連原油旣已開始放運、日來勢必蟬聯、故人心下游、各油行市均紛粉挫跌、計開膠州油一百二十件、價爲七十四元至七十四元半、靑岐油三百件、價爲七十七元、烟岐油三百件、價爲七十八元、靑島油七十桶、價爲一百元、江北油五十桶、價爲一百元、又聽裝二百聽、價爲九十八元、常州來廠油三十桶、價爲一百零一元、蚌埠油二十桶、價爲一百元、刻下市價雖見回落、但望有力份子、勿冉放出魔手、復作間接殺人之罪魁、</p>
<p>生油今有五千九百十四聽、又二百五十件、運往香港、又一百五十件、運往厦門、</p>
<h3>糖市　潮靑刁靑　產區均已登塲</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢平平、上落無多、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白本棧五十八元半、外棧新到貨五十九元、老貨五十九元、轉口仍四十八元、太古車白B嘜東棧五十九元、西棧五十九元三角、CW嘜五十九元、CX嘜五十八元七角、DY嘜五十八元半、HX嘜五十八元、車赤荷赤、俱無更動、本綿白振記一號五十八元半、二號五十八元、一號冰六十八元半、晶明冰七十元、國產刁靑據貨主函訊、產區業已見新、以出貨未旺、辦價仍昂、故乏運申、收成的僅半數、恐未能過宜也、此間　！貨以日輪來貨開價較宜、回小二元、昨建帮開二百餘包四十四元、又普通漢赤一百二十包三十九元、聞汕頭帮消息、新潮靑本屆收成亦僅五分、產價仍高未能合劃云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布午後回振　銷路南洋幫較旺</h3>
<p>國布　棉布承上日疲勢晨市外匯續見放長、人心鬆懈、賣風驟盛、各布市盤每疋回小五角左右、購戶進意淡薄、成交大减、惟後市匯市突然回縮、各布亦一致回挺、接近原盤、結果每疋微跌一角至二角半、</p>

<h3>歐洲大戰中之法童軍</h3>
<p>— 天視</p>
<p>八十八師死守四行介庫之偉績，每令吾人聯想及於楊惠敏女士冒險送入重圍之燦爛國微，柬川靑木關中國童子軍總會所發表之光榮史實，與彼楊女士，先後輝映者，或可裒然成巨帙。壯烈哉童軍！德行機敏健康美諸要件，備於一身，而且頻作無止限之發展。</p>
<p>童軍創始人英爵士博同寳惠Lord　R.Baden-Powell之言曰：「爾曹所尋覓者爲和平，但如一國不幸而遇外患之來，爾曹一切有備。即常爲國服務。」</p>
<p>今西方之人，盡知童子軍之鍛鍊育年，爲能使成大有爲之領袖人物，蓋領袖之才，不僅當當知聞與學識，而必須經氣質之陶鎔與品格之鍛鍊，同時更須有自動之機能，以完成其職責，此所謂學力而外，又必能富精神之能力，而允常有「能服從」之美德。苟其人能兼粽上述之兩長，而又能如博同寳惠勳爵之所謂一切有備，自易能副吾華古說『有備無患」之箴言。</p>
<p>爰舉歐戰發生以來法國業子軍爲國服務之事功，持與我華相　證。</p>
<p>一曰完成田野之收穫，法國旣宜吿動員，丁壯相率赴前綫，農莊屆秋收而缺乏幫工，法農部遂召集童軍，代行芟刈。此與我國湖南汨羅江至衡陽止軍民合作之秋收，大致相似。我華鄉民視軍人爲友，而彼法國田戶，則稱無事不幹之童軍爲「莞爾而笑之軍人。」二曰掘築防空壕以備不虞之急。三曰乘坐機器脚踏車以傳遞機要信件，旣速且準。四曰散入後方各地邊關或沿海，從事敏銳之偵察，而尤注意敵方空襲之影蹤，並於夜間表演黑夜不迷路之各種方法而熟習之。五曰搬移受傷之人，並施第一步急救旁及飲食撫慰諸工作。六曰疏散小孩與病人。七曰疏散大城市之民衆。八曰在火車站或街口，從事指導與照料。　平心而論，其最著之偉績，爲在開戰之初，照料旅客與調整交通，因以加速自大城市分向內地之疏散步聚。某中立國一旅客過巴黎之記述有云。</p>
<p>午前三天未明，火車駛入黯淡無光之巴黎北站，四顧不見汽車，又不能遇代搬行李之站役。正在旁皇失措之時，幸而黑地獖出童子軍三數輩，應手即得之汽車，不知何處攫來，莫可奈何之笨重箱篋，一瞬間均已送上汽車，衆旅客銜感同深，正欲稱謝，此童子軍多人，早已不知去向。　又聞有一老婦抵車站，患殘疾而不良於行，在羣衆擾攘中，忽然拋失行李，所携幼子，又於一　間中途分散。而此踽踽一身之老婦，却尚夷然無懼色，謂「有童子軍在，一切可無憂也。」未幾行李與幼兒，果賴童軍為助而一無所失，此則深見一般人民對童子軍信念之深。且童子軍之工作，大抵處以鎭靜，而不見疏誤之發生，益力以活潑潑地之「喜氣」迎人，允足於危難之中，和緩緊張之空氣，而因多數人「快慰」之一念，加强勉自振勵之能力與精神也。</p>
<h3>不要怕羞</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>怕羞該是一種天性。小朋友普遍地都怕羞，會見微微陌生些的尊長親友，往往躱避開來，不肯爽快率直的稱呼一聲，或稅句話，須經父母强迫可囑，才勉强奉命，然已面紅耳赤，一溜烟的避開了。這並不是小朋友的有失禮貌，而是生性怕羞。</p>
<p>怕羞旣屬天性，自然未可厚非。不過小朋友們不能把怕羞養成習慣，致處處地方都怕羞，處處地方都畏縮，那便對自己發生出莫大的障礙來了。譬如在學業方面，就受到極大的影響。書本上本來有了疑義，本預備站起來向師長發問，只因爲怕羞，不敢在衆目睽睽之下把懷疑的問題提出，防備引人笑話，因此便含糊過去，一直到長大，對於那些疑義還是不明白，甚或成爲終身遺憾，這是極明顯的吃了怕羞的虧。</p>
<p>再如被師長喊到黑板上去演算題，本來那算題並不難，能演得迅捷無訛，可以獲得「甲」專。但也爲怕羞關係，面對黑板，反而變得心猿意馬，猶豫不決，粉筆揑在手裏，戰戰兢兢，不敢落筆，若再經師長一催促，終至錯誤百出。被認爲不用心，愚笨，那時心中雖大呼寃枉，別人怎會了解你呢？這又是被怕羞心理所害。</p>
<p>怕羞雖不算是惡劣的習慣，但它能壓制小朋友的天才與本能力的發洩，能使聰敏形成愚笨，能埋沒自己的意志，而成爲一個附庸。小朋友也許有過這樣的遭遇，當敎師叫你畫自由畫時，假使沒有人站在你身旁，一定會大膽的揮筆畫三一幅山水圖，或者一幅飛機空戰圖。萬一敎師站在你旁邊時，却拘東得連一隻小小的飛島都畫不出。你的淡量頓時變狹小，天才頓時發揮不出。豈不是最大的損失嗎！</p>
<p>所以小朋友們必須放出勇氣，打破怕羞的心理作用。即使在大庭廣衆之下，要說儘說，要做儘做！</p>
<h3>郵　剪貼畫</h3>
<p>— 十四歲程士啟作</p>
<h3>冬用夏熱</h3>
<p>— 蘇明</p>
<p>時鐘有了四下，庸兒才從學校裏回家，一路上的西北風，刮在他臉上相當的可怕，害得他的頭縮在大衣領裏，不敢十二分伸出來。好容易的走到了家，他的一雙耳殼早已凍得紅潤潤地，一到了屋子裏，那耳殼似乎熱得在發燒。當他放下書的時候，便這樣的咕噥着：「這樣冷的天氣眞難受，還是熱天好。」</p>
<p>「然而大夏天的熱，也不是好受的。」他哥哥——宗兒駁他一句。</p>
<p>「不錯，在冬天說夏天好，而在熱天反以爲冷天好。不過氣候爲什麼這樣的不平均？冷得要凍死人，熱起來使人頭暈腦脹。假使把夏天的熱積儲起來，到了冬天，把它利用一下，豈不好嗎？」</p>
<p>「對啦！在夏天，我們的屋頂被火一般的陽光炙晒得十分熱，可是一到了夜裏，那些熱却白白地消耗了，眞可惜，要是把它儲積起來，到了冷天，可以不十分寒冷了。」宗兒高聲說得很起緊。</p>
<p>「那麽怎樣把熱儲積呢？」這問題引起了庸兒的興趣。</p>
<p>「據有人設計：在屋頂上裝了一根水管，那水便被陽光晒得很熱，然後把水從水管引入到地下很深的泥土裏，因爲在這很深的地層下，地面上空氣溫度的變動，不會影響地底下水的溫度，因此這晒熱的水可以保藏在地層下。到了冷天，把溫暖的水送入裝有大汽管的蒸發器。用人工降低空氣的壓力，使酒精蒸發，（你要知道液體變成汽題，必須吸收熱，反之，則放散所吸收的熱，假使你燒水，必須加了熱，那水才化成汽。）酒精便吸收水的一部分熱，化成酒精的蒸汽，把它散發到另一隻器具中，那裏的壓力很高，那酒精蒸汽重又結成液體，把它剛才吸收的熱放出來，使附近的冷水也溫暖了，於是把這熱的水傳達到汽管中，再通進各間屋子裏，把冷氣都可驅逐出去。這方法很簡便，然而在事實上不會這樣的容易，自然也要消耗一些電力或燃料，可以保持水的循環流仃，但是比了燒煤的費用要省掉一半。不過那引人地層下的水管差不多要一百多尺深，才有效力，那是比較困難一些。」</p>
<p>「夏天的熱，可以藏到冬天來用，眞是件有趣的事情。」庸兒笑嘻嘻的說。</p>

<h3>我的童年</h3>
<p>— 楊晋豪</p>
<p>那一個兒童是不喜歡遊戲的？在兒童時代，也應當遊歲遊戲，來活潑精神，强壯身體。倘若一天到晚，埋頭書桌，拚命死用功，弄得身體衰弱，精神呆鈍，那不是變成了老頭子嗎？</p>
<p>不過，遊戲過度，妨害了正當事情，這樣浪費光陰，也是不應常的。</p>
<p>我在兒童時代，就是太喜歡了遊戲，而不曾好好地讀書；現在回想起來，實在有點懊悔。</p>
<p>那時候，我老是糾結了幾個小朋友，在空塲上打壘臺，到墳頭去打筋斗，拿起竹竿使槍玩棒，自然也常常踢毽子，拍皮球，滾鐵環，到了大寒天，就丟雪球，堆雪人，敲冰鑼，有時還要脫衣赤膊，顯出我是一個英雄好漢。不過，這些遊戲却練好了我的身體，因此，到大來雖然生了幾决大病，我也担當過去了。</p>
<p>我起先進的是一位堂兄開設的私塾，讀的什麼「三字經」「孟子」「論語……，一點也不懂得。後來我父親抽空在家裏講學，敎幾個貧苦的鄕隣小朋友，但是那些老古董，我仍舊讀不進去。父親生性疏懶，不多時候，也不高興敎了，就送我到東街市梢的一隻小學裏去，可是我進了學校就納悶。便常常賴學。</p>
<p>這時我搭到了幾個新朋友，他們是在河南的一隻小學裏讀書的，他們說，在那裏讀書是怎樣地有趣，勸我也進去讀，不知道是不是我的竅門開了，我突地下了用功讀書的決心，自己覺得年紀不算小了，還讀不到多少書，是多麽難爲情呵！</p>
<p>到開學的時候，我便插進了河南的那隻小學裏。以後就沒有缺過課。甚至家裏有事情，我也要上學去。</p>
<p>不過，在課後，我們還是遊戲。常常在夜裏，集合了許多小同，有的提了燈籠，有的拿了竹竿，一連串排了隊伍，唱着國歌，在東西市梢，南北郊野，繞行了一個大圈子。「一！二！三！四！」的步伐口令，也喊得震天價響。我們也像是在巡夜，是在保衛家鄉，是在防備着强敵盜賊的偷襲。大家的精神都很振作，興奮，這養成了我們這些孩子的集團精神。</p>
<p>我在幼時，還喜歡到鄉間去寫生，在園裏種花草，紮花盆，砌花壇，以及燒製糖餅；也常常一個人站在水橋上釣魚，或者跟了女僕到田岸去挑野菜。這些事情，在我一方面是遊戲，一方面也是勞作，做來眞覺愉快。我現在，也常常把勞作當做遊戲，所以做起來不覺得氣悶呢。</p>
<p>隔了一年，我就到外埠去進高小了。那是還是遊戲的時候多。直到進了中學，才拚命地讀課外的書。現在我能够寫寫文章，還是許多課外書帮助我的。</p>

<p>本報特訊</p>
<h3>英茵返記</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>吳性栽赴昆明電約　為合衆主演西太后</p>
<p>新年裏，頗想找些新消息，給讀者興奮，正好昨天得着一樁好材料，現在報道給諸位聽，那便是英茵回到了上海。記得去年年底，得渝友航信，說重慶盛傳英茵失踪。原信語焉不詳，而香港的報紙上也有關於英茵的文字記載，但是對於失蹤的原因，都是猜測之辭，沒有確實的記述。誰料這位重慶盛傳着失蹤的英茵，昨天晚上竟在「孤島」的霞飛路上出現。</p>
<p>英茵自「靑鳥」解散後，就到內地去，輾轉到重慶，也將兩年了。她的演戲，以爽辣著稱，「業實」的「武則天」是她成名之作。在新中國戰時首都的重慶，無論在電影，話劇方面，都需要她這樣的人材，所以她的突然失蹤，就迅速地傳到了上海。</p>
<p>現在記者在無意中遇見了，自然得問起所以到上海來的原因，在匆促之間，承她簡略的告訴了我</p>
<p>明華公司在「孔夫子」之後，將和合衆聯合攝製「西太后」，孔夫子一角千選萬選總算唐槐秋突然回來而找到了適合的人選，於是對於西太后就事先徵求兩公司同人的意見，預備早日決定了，以免臨渴掘井，恰巧吳性栽到昆明去，就託他不妨打一個電報到重慶去，和英茵談判一下，更因爲有費穆等的函電相邀，英茵答應不遠千里而來主演這部「西太后」。重慶盛傳她失蹤的時候，就是她乘飛機到香港去；香港報紙登載着關於她種種的時候，就是她等着吳性栽從昆明同來而一同回上每。</p>
<p>現在她暫時寄宿在友人家里，從事研究攝製「西太后」的準備。等到「孔夫子」竣事，「西太后」便接着開拍。</p>
<h3>英茵健美如昔</h3>
<p>— 昭</p>
<h3>戰長沙</h3>
<p>— 星岩</p>
<p>「戰長沙」一名關黃對刀，曩年汪桂芬譚鑫培時於內廷中演之，汪飾雲長，譚飾漢升，復配以李連仲之魏延，旗鼓相當，推爲當時一絕。迨大頭歸隱，譚氏已屆晚年，則恒自飾紅臉，而以李徒瑞德寳去黃忠，有此習慣，一般人遂覺是劇之紅生似居於首席地位而靠把武老生乃爲其副手矣，實則不然。緣關黃二人在劇中皆佔重要地位，無所軒輊，若帶法塲一幕，黃之唱作，更爲繁重，似又覺黃重於關矣。年來南下之鬚生固多，惟以紅生無適當人選，（林樹森多不與京角同台）遂致此大好名劇竟已絕跡於紅氍毺上，未免使顧曲周郎望眼欲穿也。此次更新邀譚派鬚生貫大元及王鴻壽（即三麻子）得意弟子李洪春，再配以武二花劉硯亭，於是「戰長沙」一劇乃得復現於吾人之眼簾。是日余曾往觀，大元學譚資格頗深，嗓音尤宜於拔高，故唱的部分可謂無懈可擊，尤以幾處倒板及最後之廻龍腔爲更見精彩。至於紮靠之邊式，並不以其軀幹略矮而有損美觀，此蓋因其幼工甚深，聞其十二歲時即能登台演劇，故自較一般半路出家之譚派老生高出多矣。該劇中尢難者端在當黃忠馬失前蹄（即關公施拖刀計時）翻身落馬時，照例須在台口翻一「波浪鼓」（翻時身平直，如搖波浪鼓然。）此種工夫非經多年之習練，不敢輕於嘗試，而况手持大刀，後有靠旗，倘不嫻此者，必致刀飛旗折，不意大元翻時極穩，乾凈漂亮，迨跪起時，其刀橫陳面前，儼若由檢塲人置其前者，即此一着，即可壓倒儕輩。邇來生角能演靠把戲者尚不多覯，遑論乎紮靠持刀翻波浪鼓矣。洪春因限於大賦，調門幾與大元相差一字有半，惟是日甚爲賣力，工架亦頗老練，硯亭長於副凈，去魏延，張飛，孟良，牛臯，等角最能展其所長，故是日在劇中亦博得好評，大元方在年富力强，甚望此次能多演共靠把譚劇，則顧曲界耳目亦可一新也。</p>

<h3>劉別謙談一九四〇年的女星</h3>
<p>— 木易</p>
<p>劉別謙最近和Picture　Play雜誌的記者談了許多話，關於一九四〇年新女星的談話，很値得注意，現特摘譯如下。</p>
<p>一九四〇年銀幕上所需要的女演員，不是木偶，舞台上的經騐是很重要的：年紀愈輕，而經騐富足的少女，她的成功機會便愈多。</p>
<p>美麗却不是最重要的東西，只有少數偉大的明星是美麗的。可是每個有名的女演員都有她們的個性，吸引力和魔力　一九四〇年明星不必有大智慧，却不能沒有　理智。</p>
<p>（編者按：劉別謙的話，極有見地，可給我國製片家及電影從業員作參考。尤其末兩句話，在上海目前的環境下，設够得體味了。）</p>
<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>貴俊卿尙在人間耶</p>
<p>所以不佞最愛瞧貴二爺的袍帶戲，他的「盜宗卷」「羣英會」「王佐斷臂」等，着實看了多少次，眞可謂百看不厭。他如他的「賣馬要鐧」更稱得起老譚後之一人，要鐧的路子與叔岩並不相同，據孫佐臣在日曾和我談過，他說老譚的鐧自視爲一絕，並不曾傳人，因他是武生底子而且他爲人又壞，恐怕被旁人偷去，所以他每回要的招數都常時改變。老元因爲同他相處頗久，况且他自個也自好武工，（彼曾有花槍孫老之綽號）故而他對於老譚的要鐧，很有心得；在不佞的寓中也要練過幾决，貴二的鐧雖不曾得過譚氏嫡傳，然而當老元隨他操琴的時候，也曾把老譚這套颶的路數要法向貴二說過，那常然離老譚還相差不遠。後來如小余的要鐧，恐怕就是老譚晚年眞所謂「减頭去尾」的玩意啦。再如又宸、菊朋、等本屬半路出家，又不曾像俊卿下過深刻的工夫，所以他們只能唱「賣馬」而不會下面的「要」鐧了。總之貴二所會的幾齣譚派戲，倒的確很實授，照上邊所說的那幾齣戲，不但不在叔岩以下。恐怕還有比小余好的地方。現在聽說他仍在烟台哈爾濱一帶住着，十分潦倒，海上不乏富於資財的票友，倘使能打探貴爺二的消息，把他接到南邊來，那倒眞能得到譚派的好玩意呢。（一七〇）</p>

<h3>元旦成立的桂林市</h3>
<p>— 公懷</p>
<p>地位衝要已成西南的國防堡壘　山川佳麗仍保持着潑刺的生命</p>
<p>桂林，是抗戰後廣西的有會，西南文化政治的中心，自南寗淪陷，這裏已變成軍事的重鎭。據華方消息，桂省府已定民國二十九年元旦，將桂林改市，並任陳恩元爲市長，至於原來的桂林縣，現改稱爲臨桂縣，縣長仍山田良驥繼任。從此，桂林在國防上的地位，當越發重要了。</p>
<p>市容的一斑</p>
<p>桂林的城垣，圍抱在嶙峋蒼翠的山峯裏，形勢非常雄偉·城周的十二里，有東鎭武勝·寗遠·安定·麗澤·東江等十二門，最熱鬧的市街，叫貢院街，蘇杭洋貨的商店，都集中在這裏，市况還相當的繁榮。自從廣州武漢，相繼失陷，長沙給大火燒掉後，湘鄂粵三省撤退下去的黨政要員和靴民，如潮水一舷的匯流到桂林，幾乎把一座小小的桂林城擠破，那時，所有的民房，租借一空，平日很恬靜的市面，也漸趨活躍了，流線型的汽車滿街爬，人的洪流在湧來湧去，店家的裝璜，也艷麗起來，都市裏五光十色的貨物，也都在桂林市上出現，它已儼然是一個現代化的城市了。但好　不長，日機一再的飛到桂林的上空，作殘酷的轟炸，於是，三分之一的房屋，被炸毀了。無數無辜的平民，被炸死了。在每次轟炸後，街道兩旁，到處是瓦礫·焦炭　炸彈坑，和散亂的電話綫，烤焦了的街樹，充滿了凄凉肅索的空氣。但在這些焦土上，不上幾天，又塡滿了用木板或蘆蓆搭成的簡陋的新屋，這種建設的力量，是誰都要驚　感佩的。</p>
<p>秀麗的山水</p>
<p>「桂林　山水甲天下，」這是大家所傳誦的。因爲桂林的山都是很挺秀的；桂林的水，（指桂江而言）澄淸可愛，恍似濾水器裏濾過的」般。中間最著名的，有獨秀峯，轟立城內，高的五十丈，和城外各山，不相聯絡的。山上有石磴三百多級，通至山巓，於此眺望，則全城景色，盡收眼底了。宋代顏延之曾有「未若獨秀者，峨峨郛邑間」的詩句去詠它，因此，獨秀的大名，便更響了。城外最著的勝跡，要算象鼻山和七星岩了。象鼻山在城南，山形像掀着鼻子的象，上有一塔，遠望如瓶。下有水月洞，成一正圓形，和山背相通，江水出入洞內，淸瑩可鑑，遠望彷彿皎潔的明月。七星岩在東門外，深邃寬大，爲桂林各岩洞冠。岩洞在棲霞寺後，洞口有一石，形似鯉魚，左旁有　深潭，據說可和灘水相通；右旁地濕而滑，偶一不愼，即有跌入潭裏的危險，土人稱爲摩天嶺。洞內須燃火把，始得前進。裏面奇形怪狀的岩石，到處都是，有的像玩球的獅子，有的像蜷臥的大象，有的像合着掌的湘山佛，有的像開口胡蘆的布袋和尙。要走二十分鐘，才得出洞。除此外，尙有伏波山·龍隱洞·永濟橋等處，也很馳譽，因篇幅關係，只得從略了。</p>

<h3>兩廣徸族考</h3>
<p>— 徐松石</p>
<p>近自粵南戰事緊張，「那陳墟　那曉虛　等地名常見報上？讀者諸君知道這些地名的意義麽？原來這些乃是兩廣徸人的地名。那陳在廣東欽縣東北。那曉在廣西邕寗正南。徸人稱田爲那，稍茅　曉。那陳就是陳出，那曉就是茅田。你這這些地名豈不是很奇趣麽？</p>
<p>現在廣東極西南角舊欽州屬和廣西西部柳江左右等流域的地方，還有許多徸人。雲南的東部和貴州的西南部，徸族的居民也　。他們較小部落的名稱，隨地而異。或稱爲徊，或稱爲仲，或稱爲　，或稱母老，或稱土老，一般都是徸類。甚至廣東海南島的黎人，也可稱爲廣義的徸族。</p>
<p>這徸族到底是怎樣的一種人呢，讀者必定很想知道。按徸字本來作徸，讀音與狀字相同。撞的名稱，原來起於店朝。作者研究嶺南古代更地，垂十餘年。現在巳經切實證明這徸人乃兩廣最初的土著。兩廣最初的土著絕對不是搖，史談不到苗。甚至如今兩廣自命為中原漢裔的，也入部分雜有徸人的血液呢。</p>
<p>這些徸八並且是今日中國最純粹的漢人。自從東晋以後，　原漢族倒巳雜了匈奴突厥鮮卑的血統。我們知道漢這一個字起因於東西漢水，而東西漢水流域古時原是徸族同胞聚居的地方。作者悉心研究徸語，知道徸人自稱男子爲勒漢。是子漢。徸語倒裝，子漢即漢子義。徸人向來自稱爲漢子，而以前中原漢人倒岐視之，眞是一件十分寃枉的事。</p>
<p>無疑地，徸人隸屬於古代南支漢族之內。自從黃帝戰勝炎帝之後，徸族大部份同化於北支漢人。那些住在西南而同化程度較淺的，便成有後代所謂徸族。今日徸語與國語的不同，只等於春秋戰國時齊楚韓魏的異音罷了。說文鈙說，「孔子沒後，諸侯力征，不統於王。惡禮樂之害己，而皆去其籟。分爲七國，言語異聲，文開徸族友人，勒漢二字究有何會義。據謂勒就是子，勒漢就字異形一。徸語特殊有何足異</p>
<p>作者旅行徸區　决之多。最近一次還在華南戰事發動之後。自桂林出發，遍歷桂北桂西和粵省西南各地。目的在於察明徸　之一般史蹟。在這大時代富中，這些撞族同胞激昂奮發，使我深深受着感動。</p>
<p>「你們徸族同胞對於今日的中華民族抱着怎樣的觀感。」作者在廣西龍勝縣向一位徸族的鄉長發問。這　姓的徸族鄉長回答說　徸人就是漢人。在廣西沒有一個徸人不是黃帝的子孫。因爲自從宋朝皇祐年間狄靑平南之後，中原大軍數十萬留住廣四邊境，與徸族女子聯婚。後代說徸語而着徸裝十年以來，土客的界限已早完全泯滅。我們徸人非但是漢裔，而目都是狄襄武公部下英勇軍人的後裔呢。軍人的後裔，當有軍人的氣概。龍　徸人很多，這决省內辦理微兵，龍勝區手續完成最早。軍人的氣概，充分表現。這就我們徸胞對於中華民族的觀念。」這寥寥　語，很淸楚地顯示徸族同胞的偉大和優秀。</p>

<p>結滙，是實施外匯及貿易管理後的產物；我國外匯管理和貿易統制所行之方式，的有五項：（一）禁止輸入與定額許可制，（二）豁免捐稅代保兵險等之獎勵輸出制，（三）茶葉，豬鬃，桐油，礦產之貿易國管，（四）限制提存及匯劃之防制資金外逃，（五）土產轉出口結匯之集中外匯。結匯便是第五項中的制度，亦即現在所欲爲申論者：</p>
<p>二十七年三月十二日頒佈外匯請核辦法，於是出口商持有之外匯，願在黑市拋售，可護高價，但進口商却願向中央銀行購員，因其爲法定匯率較長。在此情形下之國家銀行，只有官價外匯之賣出無官價外匯之買進，若欲塡補頭寸，則必求同黑市塲，而蒙法價與黑　差額之巨　損失。於是在同年六月中旬先後頒佈出口結匯法令。其　即在使出口商因出口滋生之外匯，得集中於政府。法令計有條例四毬，與郵政包裹結售外匯辦法及其應注意事項　補充辦法三種。叫種條例為商人運貨出口”售結外匯辦法，出口貨物應結外匯之種類及其辦法，辦理運貨出口及售結外匯應注意事項，貨物出口與售結外匯實施條例。</p>
<p>今年七月二日又頒佈領取結匯差額辦法三條，規定出口貨物凡結匯與政府者，得憑結匯證件，向結匯艱行領取法價與中交掛牌價格之差額。俾减輕商民成本，以資鼓勵出口。查中國現有三種匯率：一爲中央銀行一四便士半之法價，一為中國交通兩銀行掛牌之實際　格，（最近的爲七便士），三為黑市價格，（最近的爲叫　士半左右）。此問指稱之差額，即去價一四便七半與中交掛牌實際價格之間，所距離之差數。的述：「政府將蒙法價與黑市差額損失」一語，此語中差額，却是指由法價至黑市面言，（去年六月黑市情形，的爲八便士）。但自今年七月日頒佈進口物品申請購買外匯規則，進口商須繳納法價與中交掛牌相差之平衡費後，此差數距　　是縮短。簡明言之：申請購匯規則頒佈　，政府用中交匯率供給外匯，其若　黑市塡補頭寸——買進賣出之間——可僅受中交價與黑市價段中之美損。</p>
<p>關於結匯商品之種類，在出口貨物應結外匪之種類及其辦　條例第一項所規定者，原爲桐油，豬鬃，茶葉，礦沙，牛皮，蛋品，五倍子，羊皮，羊毛，藥材，蠶絲，草帽，頭髮，苧蔴，腸衣，棉花，花生，芝蔴，烟草，木頭，竹類，杏仁，鴨毛，獸皮，等二十四種。今年一月財部爲優惠商民起見，從二十四種內除去十種，將羊皮獸皮合稱為皮貨類，　結外匯者，改减爲桐油，豬鬃，茶葉，礦產，皮革，皮、，五倍　，藥村，羊毛，絲綢，苧蔴，陽衣，羽毛，等十三類。在九月底，財部電令浙關：「不論士產適合外銷興吾，概頒結匯，方准啟運」。於是結匯之商品範圍又擴人。</p>
<p>從整個國家立塲以言，結匯除能增殖外匯外，尙可加强控制內國匯兌。蓋在淪陷區中法幣，國府權力不及，無從作有效管理，使其從事利於國民經濟之流通，因之乃干涉內國匯兌，以冀减少此區域間過剩游資。其　體辦法，大概爲提高升水，獎勵資金內移參加生產建設，提高貼水以及額定限制，限制匯什淪陷區。但有部份重利輕義之商家行號，和金融機　，給匯款者較官家銀行爲優之條件，藉以招攬匯款，輾轉間漁利匯水。此種情形，多半是一匡計頭寸相等」之一軋匯性質。其除受「匡計頭寸相等」之的束外，完全爲自由匯兌，與國府之干涉政策實相牴觸。七月初頒佈領取匯差辦法條例中第二第三兩項，有明文規定：凡結匯於中交應得之法幣，及領取差額之法幣，由中交於內地支付之。其用意即在使出口商因出口而得　法幣，强制由中交匯入內地，俾减少上述牟利機關，與內地自由通匯之頭寸。故結匯實含有加强按制內滙之作用。因控制內匯之　强可使淪陷區游資间少也</p>
<h3>名言二則</h3>

<p>（一）心理學家萊維特博士</p>
<p>正確的思想及生活，加以身心的鍛鍊及發展，你這架奇巧的機械（指人體）會替你做　益無害的和諧工作。你也有極大的能力，這能力，別人賴其獲得成功及快樂；因爲你的自信力被搖動，你的生活就反常，好像　池短路，電流枯竭一樣。這些都可以矯正的。</p>
<p>（二）有生之初，造物並未指定某人應窮苦，某人應富有，某人應失敗。某人應成功；幼時的訓練，環境，及伙伴，對於養成善惡的習慣，雖有極大影響。但這些習慣和趨勢是可以改變的。我們生在世界上好像　塊陶土，刻以　成各種形狀。我們的一切並不是命中註定的，而是自己可以做主的，所以第「應　懂得」好自為之一的重要。</p>

<h3>乞丐狀院概况</h3>
<p>— 浮雲</p>
<p>本市乞丐留簽院，爲國際救世軍所主辦，院址在法租界西愛咸斯路祁齊路口，附設於國際救濟會第二收容所中。佔用四座草棚，內分辦公室，室長室，婦女室，工作室，巡捕室，以及乞丐臥室；現有乞丐六百餘人，內有婦女乞丐五六十人，有五六十歲的老嫗，也有十歲左右的小囡。這班乞丐的來源，多數爲法租界捕房拘捕送院，間亦有山慈善機關送入，基督敎如慕爾堂等處，亦時有送去。他們在院內，不呼姓名，如昔日之游民習勤所一樣，一律叫號頭的數碼。彼等大率是流落街頭，無衣無食的乞丐，無論另女，多數染患雅片白麵，嗎啡針等毒癮</p>
<p>日常生活：每晨六時起身，同揩大鍋面（係面水放在一只缸內，每一缸圍立十人，用十條毛巾同揩。）六時半齊集操塲，匕時工作人吃粥，（工作人指院內服務者）七時半跑步，八時半入棚，各人頂備碗筷，（每人有院發給飯碗二只竹筷一雙）九時食粥，食粥儘量吃飽；食後在露天曬太陽，除天陰落雨外，絕對禁止息坐舖上，允不許日間畫寢，下午四時食飯，菜或羅蔔湯，靑菜湯；問隔三四日，發一次鹹菜，作食粥菜。每晚七時，山書記在各住棚內點名，點名後就寢。染毒癮者，每日下午三時，由女省謎到棚內，發給藥水；遇有疾病，報靑班長，或書記，至國際第一收容所內，取藥給服。遇病重老，遷入病房，由病房班長，領同臨吋工，輸値看護；亡故山同仁輔元堂　　。在院守規安靜，的三月後，即可解出，惟須經過具保手續；吾則，不能自由出外。</p>
<p>服務一斑：院內特設巡捕室，由捕房撥派一班巡捕，常川駐院，擔任守門，及院內一切警衛工作。另出國際第二收容所，選派難民中能擔在工作者，稱爲室長，分司管門，服役等　工作，每月有菜錢每人三元。各棚內設正，副班長各一人，另有書記一人，執司該棚內衣，被，人事，臀藥等事。又於住棚人中，挑選臨時工，（該院內工作面無菜錢者，皆呼爲臨時工，）十數人不等，擔任扛飯，（飯在第二收容所內燒煮）淸道（掃地），淸潔（糞除），以及理髮，裁縫等工作，吿係由住院羣衆內挑選據任。</p>
<p>生產工作：係挑出年靑，及十餘歲兒童，現祇做一種柳條籃工作，小者如網籃容量，大者似小米蘿一樣，此項柳條籃，係銷洋莊，爲外國人用品。</p>
<p>衣被發給：入院乞丐，類皆衣服　褸，由院發給灰布棉襖褲一套，兩人合蓋一被，被裏，面，吿爲黑布所製。睏舖爲上下層格子舖，係用竹隔成，睏板亦係竹板所製。</p>
<p>管理及其他：因住院乞丐，大多數皆野性不竊，生活浪漫，故管理須取嚴格，除守門山兩華捕輪値外，院內墻角，厠坑，皆有巡捕立崗，防範圖逃。在規定的日常生活，須一髁運從，如六時不起身，即須吃「油炸檜」（係用兩根籘條，絞成油炸檜的）樣式，外面用鐵絲紮成。打碎飯碗吃竹笋烤肉，（係用竹板責打，敲砟飯碗，須吃十記竹板。）遺失竹筷，責打十下，香烟絕對禁吸，在入院時，經過檢查各人身邊，亦非常嚴密；在院內，如有發見吸炯，須打屁股四十板；此種頑皮不悛之乞丐，經在院三月之管束，對於其習氣，多所改變，亦該院管理之功也。</p>

<h3>芬蘭人的特性</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>首先我們要提出的芬蘭人是每一個能够耐得勞，吃得苦，有團結性的，所以這一次對　　聯，它的士兵，能够奮勇作戰。事實吿訴教們，在近代戰爭中，單憑武器的優越還是不够的，芬蘭這一次能堅强抗禦，地利固然爲一大原因，而人和却也是主要的因素。</p>
<p>據說芬蘭人原初是蒙古人種，距今十三世紀之前，遷居到芬蘭，直到現在，住在那邊。地處北歐，天氣寒冷，所以由於地理關係，就練成一種强健的體格，耐勞的精神。到一八〇九年爲止，差不多有五世紀之久，山瑞典統治着。自一八〇九年到一九一七年，芬蘭是屬於俄國的一部，雖然是自治的，但芬蘭人在那時就有仇俄的態度。到一九一七年十月七日，就獨立而建成了一個新共和國。</p>
<p>到現在還祇有二十年的歷史，然而在過去二十年中，因爲芬蘭人能够通力合作，悉心經營，在一個很短的時間中，巳把芬蘭什麽都建設得根好，儼然是一個姿熊簇新的國家了。</p>
<p>芬蘭的敎育也很發達，全國各地，學校到處普及，所以國民之中，文盲的數字也因以極低。而且他們能够實行民主政策的，婦女早已獲得參政權，和男子一樣，到了二十一歲，就有投票權。無論在法律上，敎育上，男女一律平等。芬蘭人對於運動，也非常注意，尤其是長跑方面，有過不少傑出的人材，直到現在，還保持着多項長跑的世界紀錄。所以芬蘭人十九有着健强的一副體格，能够吃苦耐勞，平時愛好運動，也是原因之一呢！</p>
<p>芬蘭之湖沼！芬蘭地多湖沼，爲大然之防禦工事。因天時地理關係，故蘇聯進攻，極爲困難。</p>

<h3>希特勒的妹妹</h3>
<p>— 世傑</p>
<p>英名赫赫威震全球的希特勒有住在奧京維也納的，一位胞妹，她本來在一家保險公司常個寫信封的職務，每月薪金勉强只够生活；自被人發覺她是國社黨領袖的胞妹之後，她反失去了職務；後來一直沒有商行再敢請敎她；所以她不得不靠着希特勒津貼度日，但她常因依賴他人生活而很痛苦，她常常對朋友說：他的快樂莫過於冉有一日能自求生活了。</p>
<p>她現在的生活是極簡樸的，住屋的租金每月只十四元，家中不僱一僕，一切家務都親自處理，她雖用了眞姓名註冊，但鄰居們只曉得她是華爾夫夫人。她所以要隱瞞着他們的緣故，爲的想避免不速之客的纏擾不休。有一家不知趣的報館把她的玄虛揭穿了，於是訪問者源源不絕，不得已只好避居友人家中。她也收到無數信件；有的請她代替投信人干涉乃兄的行爲，有的是滿紙恭維，還有的是一味毒駡，這二類信件都是她僧恨的。</p>
<p>波拉希特勒女士很愛靜居，難得和鄰舍們閒談，平日接見的人，只有寥寥數友。她每年去德國一次，和其兄相處數星期而已。</p>
<p>科學趣談</p>
<h3>驚人的重量</h3>
<p>— 觀</p>
<p>寗波人到上海來做生意是上算的，譬如一船鹹蟹或鮮帶魚山寗波裝運至上海，我們且不管他打幾分的利息，單以份量而論，已重若了一點，但這並不是所用的秤二樣。</p>
<p>原來物體受地心的吸力，才發生了重量，愈近地心則所受吸力愈多，物體愈重。高山上稱一件東西較平地爲輕，這巳經過多次試騐了。現在我們的地球並不是「滴瀝滾圓」，赤道較爲膨大，二極較近地心，同時地球不知休息，整日整夜地自轉着，在共表面的一切動植礦物，若無吸力，早已被牠的「離心力」拋到九霄雲外，所以「離心力」抵消了一部份的事量，而這離心力在赤道上特別厲害。有上述二個原因，在二極有一千磅重的東西，帶着原秤，拿到赤道上再去秤，却只剩了九百九十五磅。若再帶回二極，一千磅是不折不扣的。</p>
<p>所以在赤道上的物體愈向北移或愈向南移則愈重，直至北極或南極爲止，上海在寗波北面，寗波貨到上海照理應當重一點，譬如巴黎與芝加哥，其南北方面的相差，並不十分遠，巴黎二千磅的東西，芝加哥秤起來只有一千九百九十八磅了。不過一隻鹹蟹或一條鮮帶魚是不必計較的，一船十船百船……自然有點上落，但無論如何，寗波老闖沒有把這些利益計算在內的。</p>
<p>上面是就地球上言，若說到字市問，則更驚人了。新近天文學界發見了一顆白矮星（White　dwarf　star），據說在該星球裏，普通一立方英寸的東西就重九千噸。在地球上，白金算是比重較大的，一立方英寸也不過二磅餘。</p>
<h3>識小錄</h3>
<p>美國有幾個臀生曾作這樣的一個試騐！他們招集十個漂亮强壯的女售貨員，叫她們戴上橡皮手套，每人拿一消毒了的盆子，向盆邊接吻一次，然後立刻加以化騐，結果是每一個吻留下二十至五百五十個細菌。他們父曾將口紅作同樣化騐，證明口紅是細菌繁殖的地方。</p>

<h3>Japanese People Resist Food Control; Anti-War Movement Intensifies in Taiwan and Korea</h3>

<h3>British Bonds Market Price Firm, Reaching Wartime Peak</h3>
<p>London: British government securities today almost reached their highest level since the start of the war. Various circles in the city are paying close attention to the tight prices of government bonds. Some now also point out that the strength of British bonds is an indication that the government will issue national defense bonds soon. However, when inquiring among important figures in banks and stock exchanges, only a few hold the above view. The factors that have created the firm market price of securities are now described as follows: (1) The new capital market has been closed since the start of the war, and investors have no other investment avenues, so there is no motivation to sell bonds. (2) Companies currently have a large amount of funds. As for the official raising of bond market prices in order to issue new bonds, there is currently no such indication. However, the authorities may issue short-term bonds to banks so that banks can circulate treasury bills and supply the funds needed until March 31, 1940. It is generally believed that banks have a large number of existing funds and treasury bills, so it is not difficult to absorb 300 million pounds of short-term bonds. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Current Problem of Local Self-Government</h3>
<p>Last winter, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang resolved to convene the National Assembly this year to formulate a constitution and implement constitutional government early. Thus, local self-government has once again become a pressing issue. Local self-government is the foundation for implementing constitutional government. As explained by Chairman Chiang in the previous session of the National Political Council, it must continue to be promoted even after the constitution is promulgated. How much more so now, when we are actively preparing for the constitutional process, should we focus on this fundamental work? Originally, local self-government in China was based on the county as the unit. Therefore, before the constitution was drafted, the "Outline of County-Level Organizations" was first established, and it was announced that local self-government would be implemented starting in March of this year. Not only that, but in Sichuan Province, where the wartime capital is located, it has also been decided to implement it as soon as possible to serve as a model for other provinces.</p>
<p>From a historical perspective, the origins of local self-government in China can be traced back to the 'division of land and establishment of wells' and the 'establishment of steps to measure mu' of the Yellow Emperor. This is too far back. In the late Qing Dynasty, local self-government was of course also a necessary element of the so-called "preparation for constitutional monarchy"; and among the political systems of the early Republic of China, there was even more of a prototype of local self-government; following the old ways and making superficial changes, everything vanished in an instant. In the three to five years after the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, the central and local governments once took the promotion of local self-government as their primary task, but in practice, they only managed to divide autonomous regions and prepare autonomous organizations. Precisely because local self-government is the preliminary work of constitutional government rather than the most basic work, it is the fundamental work rather than superficial work, it is very difficult to complete; especially during the difficult times of the nation, with repeated setbacks.</p>
<p>Recent local self-government that deserves comparison and consideration for the present: (1) In the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, the Nanchang Headquarters issued a directive to all provinces within the bandit suppression area to first implement Baojia as a temporary solution. Other provinces also followed suit one after another, so that the original work of promoting self-government gradually slowed down. As a result, self-government and Baojia formed a confrontational state. The Baojia system is to handle local security, and according to the county self-government law revised by the previous Legislative Yuan, county security matters are one of the main political affairs of county self-government; therefore, Baojia was originally a part of self-government, and Baojia should be accommodated within the self-government organization. Now, the "Outline of County-Level Organizations" stipulates that Baojia is attached to the township organization, which is what is meant by this. Some contemporary commentators believe that the Baojia system is conducive to managing people, but not necessarily conducive to managing affairs; that there are too many levels of self-government, and that handling affairs is inevitably hindered. They do not know that during the War of Resistance, wherever enemy cavalry arrived, villages were often reduced to ruins, and it was difficult for the small villagers in the countryside to cling to one corner as in peacetime. If the Baojia and self-government organizations are integrated into one, it will not only be easier for the state to conscript soldiers, but also people from Jia can drift to Yi and still organize at any time, without being limited by geographical area. This is a necessary condition for handling wartime local self-government and should not be taken lightly.</p>
<p>(2) The National Government previously organized the Central Local Self-Government Planning Committee, which formulated the procedure for the implementation of self-government as three stages: (A) fostering self-government, (B) starting self-government, and (C) completing self-government. In the first stage, the county mayors are appointed by the government according to law, and a county council is established. Township chiefs are elected by the people of their respective districts, and the county magistrate selects one for appointment. In the second stage, the county mayors are still appointed by the government, and the county councilors and township chiefs are elected by the people. In the third stage, all of the above personnel are elected by the people. But the situation varies from place to place, and the environment is very different, especially during military periods, there is a distinction between occupied areas, guerrilla areas and safe areas. The central government should only make flexible regulations so that they can be adapted to local conditions and times. The division of autonomous regions is most closely related to the promotion of self-government. Before the division, of course, an overall plan must be made based on geography, history, customs, transportation, products, and so on. These measures, in theory, seem impossible to be taken lightly during wartime, but in many places, precisely because of the impact of the war, traffic is obstructed, and people are displaced. If this kind of autonomous region remains the same as before, it will be no different from "building a car behind closed doors." Isn't it ridiculous to plan self-government for the people in the occupied areas? To remedy this, it seems that the administrative commissioner and the county magistrate should conduct investigations nearby and properly revise them. The election of township chiefs cannot but be approved by the higher authorities for the commissioner and county magistrate to send trained personnel as self-government instructors to go to various places to guide them separately.</p>
<p>(3) The County Organization Law of the 17th year of the Republic of China adopted a four-level system of districts, townships, villages, and neighborhoods. There were too many levels! It was difficult to implement, and the affairs of districts and townships were mostly duplicated, which was superfluous. The recent "Outline of County-Level Organizations" stipulates that it should be one level of township, which corrects this shortcoming. The fact that it attaches Baojia to the township organization is in line with the needs of wartime, as mentioned above. But these are still only regulations in principle. In addition to dividing autonomous regions, how to conduct household registration, handle personnel registration, how to reorganize land and approve land prices; how to consider both matters entrusted by the central government and local matters; how to raise self-government funds. All of these must be done in parallel and complement each other. It is not a simple matter in itself, and it is even more difficult to stabilize the local situation. I still remember in early February of last year, it was widely reported that the central government was planning to (1) restore the administrative institutions in the guerrilla war zones, (2) implement militarization of the organizations of the governments of provinces, cities, and counties, (3) select outstanding youth to participate in improving local administrative work, and (4) establish training centers for local administrative cadres in various provinces. These plans may have been implemented or not. We deeply feel that to implement local self-government, we still need to start with these necessary measures.</p>
<h3>U.S. Lawmakers Advocate Stricter Sanctions Against Japan; Propose Banning Arms and Raw Material Exports to Japan; Must Make Japan Stop Its Aggression Against China</h3>
<p>Washington: Republican Congressman Alexander declared here yesterday that the United States must impose strong pressure on Japan to force Japan to stop its aggression against China, even if the imposition of strong pressure leads to war between Japan and the United States, it is still acceptable. Alexander and Democratic Senator Hugh Wiley Bach are well-known anti-Japanese figures in Congress. They stated that even if Japan agrees to guarantee U.S. interests in the Far East, the U.S. must still impose pressure on Japan to stop its aggression. The position they hold is that no matter how Japan treats U.S. interests in China, the U.S. must take retaliatory action against Japan because Japan is invading China. This concept is diametrically opposed to that announced by Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who represents the official opinion. Pittman advocates punishing Japan to force Japan to recognize U.S. interests in the Far East. Alexander said that when he and the masses in the western and central states discussed the situation in Japan in the autumn, they found that they strongly supported punitive measures against Japan. The feelings of the American people are not based on commercial issues, but on the Japanese military's aggression against China. He said that we are currently facing two dangerous paths. We cannot adopt a "hands-off" policy towards the Far East. We cannot allow Japan to complete its aggression against China, Australia, New Zealand, India, and the Philippines in order to avoid direct conflict with Japan. The second path is to take a tough stance against Japan and impose a ban on arms and raw material exports to Japan, without considering the danger of war with Japan. Although this second path is more dangerous than the first "hands-off" policy in the near future, it is more appropriate in the long run. I believe that we will encounter a powerful enemy in terms of manpower and materials in the Pacific. Although Japan, the Soviet Union, and Germany are not allied, they have the same goals, so we must regard each of these countries as our enemy. As for Mr. Hugh Wiley Bach's statement that he will request Congress to immediately pass his proposed resolution to ban arms and raw material exports to Japan after the 1911 U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce expires on January 26. He said, "I do not agree with the generally held view that treaties can prevent the declaration of an embargo against Japan, but because the government feels that it is necessary to announce the abolition of the treaty, I agree to wait until June. I do not believe that an embargo should be considered to force Japan to make concessions to our country in China and the Far East. I mean, if Japan continues to violate the Nine-Power Treaty that our country has signed, our attitude should still be as before. My resolution is to punish any country that violates the Nine-Power Treaty and to prevent the American people from helping Japan to continue its aggression against China, whose territorial integrity our treaty must respect." The people of the western coast of the United States unanimously hope that the United States must condemn Japan's aggression against China and punish Japan. (6th United Press)</p>

<h3>Japan Establishes Puppet Regime: Approved by the Asia Development Board; Japanese Government Holds Emergency Cabinet Meeting Yesterday; Passes Various Special Account Budgets</h3>
<p>Tokyo: It is reported that the Asia Development Board's Administrative Department today formally approved "Basic Principles Regarding the Establishment of a New 'Central Government' in China." It is heard that these principles include the conditions of the Konoe Declaration of November 3, 1938. It is expected that the emergency cabinet meeting will also approve these principles. Representatives from the Army Ministry and the General Staff Headquarters met yesterday before the Asia Development Board convened, and Mr. Yanagawa, Director-General of the Asia Development Board, explained in detail the details of the proposed "new regime."

Therefore, a unanimous opinion was reached to strongly assist his movement. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 p.m. (Dōmei News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: After the Asia Development Board meeting held by the Japanese government on the 6th, the Chief Cabinet Secretary issued a statement as follows: "Regarding the activities of Mr. Wang Jingwei regarding the establishment of a new central government in China, we have collected local reports, and it is generally recognized that most of his actions are in line with the intentions of the Japanese Empire. Therefore, at the Asia Development Board meeting held today, a unanimous opinion was reached to implement strong support for Mr. Wang's movement, in order to bring about the early birth of a new central government." (Dōmei News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The basic policy of the Japanese government regarding the establishment of a new central government in China and the attitude of supporting it was formally decided at the Asia Development Board's emergency meeting held on the 6th. Therefore, the government authorities will convene an emergency cabinet meeting from 1:00 p.m. on the 8th to discuss and decide on the matter, and then clarify to China and foreign countries what form and attitude the Japanese Empire will take in dealing with the new regime movement.

<p>Tokyo: The budget for the Special Accounts for Overseas Territories and Railway Communication for the 14th year of Showa has recently been negotiated by the Ministry of Finance and relevant authorities. The rough estimate was completed yesterday (5th) and will be submitted to today's emergency cabinet meeting for formal decision. The total amount of funds transferred from various special accounts to temporary military expenses is 158 million yen, an increase of 31 million yen compared to the 127 million yen this year.

<p>Tokyo: The Japanese government authorities do not hold a very pessimistic view of the anti-government movement of the Diet members from various factions in the House of Representatives. They believe that the mission of the current cabinet is to handle the China Incident, and the basic policy of the Japanese side to deal with the new regime in China has also been decided. The handling of the incident will soon have epoch-making progress, and the situation of the political parties is only that the Diet Members' Association is still taking a tough anti-government attitude. As for the leaders of the political parties, such as the leaders of the Minseitō Party, they have already stated their attitude, willing to maintain their original attitude, support the government, and cooperate with the government from outside the cabinet. Therefore, the current situation is not very pessimistic for the government. The government plans to ask cabinet members from political parties to make extra efforts to find out the exact situation of the political parties and break the deadlock, and plans to hold a meeting of the leaders of the five parties at an appropriate time to frankly express the government's true intentions and request understanding, in order to face the reopened parliament after the recess.

If possible, an emergency cabinet meeting will be held from 1:00 p.m. on the 8th to discuss it. The Prime Minister also requested all cabinet members to cooperate with each other on daily necessities such as rice, coal, electricity, and fertilizer, in order to establish a permanent countermeasure as soon as possible and make every effort to stabilize the people's lives.

<h3>Japanese Banker Talks About the Sino-Japanese War: Hopes for an Early End</h3>
<p>London: Viscount Kanō, manager of the Yokohama Specie Bank's London branch, told a Reuters reporter here today that he believes that the Sino-Japanese conflict can be satisfactorily resolved in the short term. Japan has now reached a position where it can fairly claim that its economic demands on China have been satisfied. If economic readjustments are maintained, there is no reason why friendly relations between the two countries should not be restored. Japan has obtained a portion of the Chinese market it needs to sell its various goods and has been able to obtain raw materials produced in China. As for China's needs, especially steel products, Japan cannot supply them all. Therefore, China must continue to obtain supplies from Britain. The cessation of the war in China is beneficial to everyone. When asked whether a method of peaceful competition has been obtained between the Lancashire cloth industry and the Japanese cotton cloth industry, Kanō replied that, in his opinion, the two cotton cloth industries do not compete. The quality of the cotton cloth produced in Lancashire is far beyond that of the cotton cloth supplied by various Japanese export markets. Therefore, he believes that the two cotton cloth industries each have their own sales channels, and through mutual adjustment, both British and Japanese cotton cloth can find markets in China. The former is sold to classes with higher living standards, while the latter is sold to ordinary classes. Kanō later praised Britain's control of contraband and the authorities' confiscation of German exports, saying that Britain treats Japanese trade very fairly, and Japanese businesses are very grateful for it. The Japanese authorities have no intention of creating any situation that would disrupt the Allied control. It is reported that Kanō is scheduled to leave the UK for Japan on Saturday and is expected to return to London in March. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>London: Mr. Purleigh, the former Shanghai correspondent for the Manchester Guardian, published an article in the newspaper today, commenting on the predictions of Viscount Kanō of Japan that the European War will reach a turning point favorable to the Allied countries at Easter and that the Sino-Japanese War will end within a month. He said that Kanō's optimism may not be without insight regarding Europe, but his estimate of the Sino-Japanese War is far from the mark. As Mr. Durdin, the New York Times correspondent in Chongqing, recently reported, China's manpower is still far above Japan's. Although transportation difficulties are increasing, a large number of supplies have been stored, and plans have been made for a large-scale counter-offensive in 1940. Unless China's independence and integrity are guaranteed, the Sino-Japanese War will continue. Mr. Tian also mentioned the issue of opening the Yangtze River, saying that economic cooperation to build a new order in East Asia is tantamount to agreeing to share the spoils, and he hopes that Britain will reject this proposal.

<h3>Strike Wave Occurs on Farms in Pampanga Province, Philippines: 20,000 People Participate, Instigated by the Socialist Party; Government Authorities Are Now Engaged in Mediation</h3>
<p>Manila: 20,000 farm laborers in Pampanga Province today launched a general strike under the direction of a socialist party, causing all agricultural activities in the province to come to a standstill. It is heard that the leader of the socialist party is a lawyer named Santos. The province has always been the region with the most labor disputes. However, according to the socialist party, the reason for the labor disputes in the region now is none other than the rivalry between the socialist party and the "Gawa" group organized by Provincial Governor Baluyut. There is a risk that the labor unrest will spread to Batangas Province, so Labor Minister Avelino has sent labor inspector Figueroa to Pampanga Province to mediate. At the same time, the government is also preparing to take high-handed measures against the strikers. It is heard that President Quezon met with the leaders of the socialist party, and Interior Minister Alunan also ordered the police to maintain order impartially. It is heard that in San Fernando, the police searched for weapons of those plotting riots. It is heard that three members of the socialist party were arrested for carrying weapons but were soon released. (Associated Press, 6th)</p>
<h3>Peace in India: German Propaganda Unreliable</h3>
<p>London: The Times wrote today that recent German rumors of extreme disturbances on the northwestern border of India and serious riots in Waziristan are unreliable. In fact, the situation in Waziristan is now calmer than it was at the beginning of last year. Although there have been some kidnappings, robberies, and disturbances, they are not enough to cause concern to the Indian authorities. Recently, German newspapers have also reported that the Soviet Union is now planning to conquer the Middle East, and Muslims are deeply concerned about this. However, the Afghan government is well-informed about Central Asia and has not seen any special military action on the border. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3>US Navy Department's Proposal: Sparks Repercussions; Borah Expresses Surprise</h3>
<p>Washington: Republican isolationist Senator Borah stated last night that he was "extremely surprised" by Navy Secretary Edison's request to Congress to grant President Roosevelt the power in peacetime to requisition industries and ships for naval use.

<h3>British Wartime Cabinet Reshuffle: Stanley Succeeds as Secretary of War; Dunglass as President of the Board of Trade; Reith as Minister of Information; Minor Positions Slightly Slower, More Changes Possible</h3>
<p>London: Number 10 Downing Street officially announced this morning that Secretary of War Hore-Belisha and Minister of Information Macmillan have resigned. The King has approved the following new appointments: 1. Stanley as Secretary of War; 2. Dunglass as President of the Board of Trade; 3. Reith as Minister of Information.</p>
<p>Hore-Belisha wrote to Prime Minister Chamberlain, saying, "I am very sorry that I was unable to accept a certain important position in the cabinet reshuffle. However, I am willing to continue to support the firm operation to the best of my ability until victory is achieved. I am pleased that my views are the same as the Prime Minister's and there is no difference between us." Chamberlain replied, saying, "I am very sorry that the government reshuffle intends to entrust you with an important position, but you have not accepted it. We are always in agreement on our political views, and we agree that it is necessary to carry out the war with great determination to achieve victory. I am very pleased." The reply also praised Hore-Belisha's measures and important reforms during his tenure as Secretary of War.</p>
<p>Macmillan wrote to the Prime Minister, saying that he had difficulty handling affairs because he did not have a seat in the House of Commons. Therefore, he asked to resign to make way for the able and promote the efficiency of the department. The Prime Minister also replied to express his gratitude.</p>
<p>New cabinet members Dunglass and Reith are not members of parliament, but it is expected that they will soon obtain seats in the House of Commons. It is heard that the Prime Minister originally intended to ask Hore-Belisha to serve as President of the Board of Trade, but Hore-Belisha did not accept it. After this change, the redistribution of important positions in the government has now been completed, but minor positions may be slightly slower or there may be more changes. Stanley will succeed Hore-Belisha and join the War Cabinet, but the President of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Information are not in the War Cabinet. Stanley is currently suffering from the flu and has not been able to report to the department yet. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>London: According to Reuters' parliamentary correspondent, the reason for Secretary of War Hore-Belisha's resignation is of course still widely speculated, but those in charge are unwilling to draw hasty conclusions and will wait for the overall situation to become clearer before expressing their opinions. As for the various suggestions published in the newspapers this morning, it should be known that all senior personnel in the War Office now have heavy responsibilities, so they have no time to comment on these suggestions. Prime Minister Chamberlain is scheduled to deliver a speech at the Lord Mayor of London's residence on Tuesday, in which he will mention the resignation of the Secretary of War, but it is questionable whether he will postpone it until Parliament reconvenes on January 16. At that time, Hore-Belisha himself will make a statement in the House of Commons, which is also uncertain, because Mr. Bei has clearly stated that he has no differences with the Prime Minister on policy. It should be noted that Mr. Bei's letter to the Prime Minister clearly expresses that there is no problem with working hard to carry out the war to achieve the goal of victory. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3>Former Secretary of War Hore-Belisha Resolutely Retires: The Army's Innovation Plan Did Not Come True; Declares He Is Still Willing to Serve the Country</h3>
<p>London: Regarding the resignation of Secretary of War Hore-Belisha, well-informed sources here recently declared that Prime Minister Chamberlain's cabinet reshuffle is the most important thing. Since Hore-Belisha took office as Secretary of War, he has implemented a policy of "civilizing" the British Army. His position in the British Empire's military affairs has become increasingly important. However, conservatives believe that the organization and needs of the British Army are different from those of other countries. Mr. Bei's innovation plan is only enough to strengthen the military's appearance and not enough to increase its strength, so resistance is very strong. In fact, Mr. Bei's policies, even in peacetime, are not without criticism, but the British Army is expanding greatly, and considering the situation after the outbreak of the war, there is nothing wrong with it. Moreover, the extent to which he personally can influence these policies is also exaggerated. Therefore, putting aside various technical issues, Mr. Bei's departure will inevitably cause regret in public opinion and in Parliament. His successor, President of the Board of Trade Stanley, is not as strong in color or prestige as Mr. Bei. Military experts in the War Office will be able to fully manipulate the situation in the future. Prime Minister Chamberlain also believes that military affairs should be the focus during wartime and politics should be the decision. The main reason for this decision to change the Secretary of War is probably here. However, it can be said that the combat goals and other general policies will not be changed as a result. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>London: At the beginning of his tenure as Secretary of War, Hore-Belisha's various reforms within the department and the employment of young and strong new people had already caused dissatisfaction among conservative military leaders before the war. Therefore, Mr. Bei had many enemies in the political world. At the end of 1939, someone had already incited him to resign, but it was unsuccessful. The greatest achievement of Mr. Bei during this period was the transportation of the British army to France without any damage. Mr. Bei insisted that the British Royal Air Force currently fighting in France should be under the command of the War Office instead of being directly commanded by the Aviation Department. This is probably the main reason for this decision to resign. The appointment of Stanley as Secretary of War has been met with surprise by all parties. It is believed that the General Staff Headquarters will take over the power in the future. Mr. Shi was proposed by the military personnel of the Army, so it is certain that he will cooperate with the Commander-in-Chief without a doubt. (Associated Press, 6th)</p>
<p>London: The new Secretary of War, Stanley, is currently suffering from a cold and was unable to take office today. Former Secretary of War Hore-Belisha issued a statement to the voters of Devonport this morning, saying, "After I was elected as a member of the House of Commons by you sixteen years ago, I have devoted myself to national affairs without interruption. You have always been my backing, and I am very grateful for your support. I have served in four departments and have always worked diligently. After taking office as Secretary of War, I know that I am duty-bound, so I thoroughly reorganized the Army and made various necessary reforms and expansions. I am honored to say that it has benefited the military's appearance and morale. In the future, no matter how difficult it is, I will always work hard and do my best. At this moment, there is no other thought but to win the war. I believe that this is understood by the people of the country. In short, since I am still a member of Devonport, I still have the opportunity to serve the country." (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Brief Biographies of the Newly Appointed Cabinet Members</p>
<p>Hore-Belisha was President of the Board of Trade in 1931, Minister of Finance in the same year, Minister of Transport in 1934, and transferred to Secretary of War in 1937. He had war merits in the last European War and was awarded the rank of Major. After serving as Secretary of War, he made many reforms, and the strength of the British Army was able to cope with the war situation, which was indeed due to his efforts.</p>
<p>Stanley was also a veteran in the last European War, serving as a major in the artillery and being wounded several times. In 1924, he served as the private secretary of the Minister of Education. In 1931, he served as an internal affairs official. Two years later, he was promoted to Minister of Transport. In 1935, he served as Minister of Labor. In 1937, he served as President of the Board of Trade. He is currently 44 years old and is one of the most promising cabinet members. It is not impossible for him to serve as Prime Minister in the future.</p>
<p>The new President of the Board of Trade, Dunglass, is a director of the Bank of England and a member of the Economic Advisory Council, and also serves as the chairman of the British Iron and Steel Federation. He has served in the industry, serving as the vice chairman of the Shipbuilding Employers' Federation, the chairman of the Coal Mines Bureau Advisory Committee, and the chairman of the British Sea Fisheries Commission. He entered the political world at the beginning of this year.</p>
<p>The new Minister of Information, Reith, is the chairman of Imperial Airways. He participated in the last European War and was wounded. In 1916, he led a delegation of key personnel to the United States to purchase military supplies. From 1922, he was the director-general of the British Broadcasting Corporation. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3>Public Opinion Resentful of Change of Secretary of War</h3>
<p>London: The British newspapers have unanimously expressed dissatisfaction with the departure of Secretary of War Hore-Belisha and the succession of Stanley. According to the Dundee Courier, "If the departure of Hore-Belisha is shocking, then the succession of Stanley is incomprehensible. Stanley served as the Minister of Trade, not only without any achievements, but the national industrial sector has no praise for him." The Times also believes that Hore-Belisha's achievements cannot be erased. The Daily Mail believes that the reason for Hore-Belisha's departure is the opposition from the military. The Daily Express is extremely resentful of Stanley's appointment as Secretary of War, believing that Stanley "is a member of the aristocracy, and it is not difficult to obtain high positions. Since he entered politics, he has been mediocre and has not shown anything. Now he is appointed as Secretary of War with heavy responsibility, which will inevitably disappoint people greatly." The Stockport Express stated, "The departure of Hore-Belisha is a loss to the British government." The Manchester Guardian and other newspapers stated, "Hore-Belisha removed the long-standing malpractices of the military and could not avoid being resented by others. His movement to reform the army organization and make it civilianized was also envied by other Secretaries of War." (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<p>London: After Secretary of War Hore-Belisha resigned, various sectors expressed their sympathy by letters and telegrams. Hore-Belisha went to the War Office this morning to say goodbye to his subordinates. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>London: According to reliable sources, Prime Minister Chamberlain had automatically asked former Secretary of War Hore-Belisha to take the position of President of the Board of Trade before he resigned. At that time, no one knew about this except Finance Minister Simon, but Hore-Belisha finally declined. According to diplomatic sources, regarding the resignation of Secretary of War Hore-Belisha, some members of Parliament will demand that the government authorities provide an explanation when Parliament reconvenes on the 16th of this month. However, at this moment, no one will lightly blame the government, so as to increase the responsibilities of the military government. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>Italian-Hungarian Talks Begin: Jointly Maintain Peace in Central Europe; Both Parties Agree Completely</h3>
<p>Venice: Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky held their first talks this morning, which lasted for an hour and a half, and were scheduled to meet again in the evening. According to Foreign Minister Ciano's remarks to the press, "The talks this morning went very earnestly, and the close relationship between the two countries has been confirmed. The two sides also completely agree on the issue of maintaining the European order and peace." (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>The Topics of the Talks Include Four Items</p>
<p>Rome: According to a semi-official Hungarian communiqué from Rome Radio, the talks between Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky in Venice today will discuss four main issues: (1) The consequences of Hungary and the Soviet Union establishing a common border; (2) The relationship between Hungary and Romania. Although it has not improved, both countries regard communism as a common enemy. This may promote the two countries to get closer; (3) The relationship between Hungary and Yugoslavia; (4) The common attitude of Italy and Hungary towards the European War. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Milan: According to the "Sera Newspaper," Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky will extensively exchange various opinions with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, for three reasons: (1) Italy is the only major European power that has not been involved in the war; (2) Rome continues to work hard to prevent other European countries, especially the Balkan countries, from being involved in the war; (3) Italy is determined to protect its interests everywhere. Therefore, maintaining peace in the Balkans will be the most important topic in the Venice talks. (Haitong, 6th)</p>
<p>Italy Seeks to Promote Hungarian-Yugoslav Relations</p>
<p>Rome: Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky arrived in Venice this morning, and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano also went to the port this evening and is scheduled to meet and talk tomorrow. Political figures here are paying close attention to this matter. It is heard that when the foreign ministers of Hungary and Italy meet, they will discuss the new situation created by the joint invasion of Poland by Germany and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union's ambitions for Southeastern Europe, and other issues related to the two countries. Diplomatic figures say that Italy's Central European policy is to maintain the status quo. For the sake of maintaining the interests of the Balkan Peninsula and the Danube River Basin, Italy naturally prioritizes maintaining peace in this corner. As for the current relationship between Italy and Hungary, it is extremely friendly and can decide on a common attitude to deal with all events. In addition, Italy urgently hopes that Hungary can adjust its relations with Romania and Yugoslavia. This issue will naturally be discussed in the talks. (Havas, 5th)</p>

<h3>American Ship Forced into War Zone, US Issues Warning to Britain, Britain to Bear Responsibility for Damages</h3>
<p>Washington - The US government has warned Britain that if American ships are forced to enter British inspection ports, resulting in loss or damage, Britain will be held responsible for compensation. The State Department today published a lengthy document from the US to the British government, conveyed through the British Ambassador to the US, Lord Lothian, regarding this matter. The State Department announced that the American ship "Mormarkson," en route to Bergen, was forced into Kirkwall, one of the British inspection ports, an area where American neutrality laws prohibit entry. Forcing American ships into war zones is a violation of American neutrality laws. Therefore, the State Department has instructed the US Ambassador to Britain to immediately contact the captain of the "Mormarkson" to obtain a detailed report of the incident and prepare for possible action. The State Department's dispatch, dated December 14th and signed by Secretary of State Hull, stated that since American shipping companies are willing to cooperate with British authorities, the State Department anticipates that American ships will not need to enter the ports of belligerent nations. If the British authorities do not consider this and find it necessary to force American ships into war zones or any port of a belligerent nation that American neutrality laws prohibit entry into, the US government will find it necessary to carefully study all the facts and take actions deemed necessary or expedient after such study. The US government, in addition to reserving all rights in such events, expects that losses and damages arising from the violation of these rights will, of course, be compensated. Given the magnanimous spirit of American shipping, it is hoped that the British government will provide a corresponding degree of convenience and accommodation. It is noted that the British government issued a note to the US on November 9th, stating that although the US has declared a war zone, Britain reserves the right to order American ships to enter inspection ports. This dispatch from the US is, in effect, a response to that. State Department personnel stated today that the term "losses and damages" includes losses incurred by American ships due to delays caused by being diverted to British ports.

<h3>Belligerent Nations Laying Mines in International Waters, Argentina Issues Protest, Demands Reservation of Right to Claim Compensation</h3>

<h3>President Roosevelt Meets with Italian Ambassador, Related to Peace Movement</h3>
<p>Washington - After meeting with President Roosevelt at the White House, the Italian Ambassador to the US, Mr. Calenna, told reporters that President Roosevelt expressed satisfaction with Italy's attitude towards the European war. Opinions were exchanged on the general international situation, and attention was given to relations between the US and Italy. (Haitong dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Washington - The Italian Ambassador to the US, Mr. Calenna, visited President Roosevelt at the White House yesterday, which has drawn significant attention from political circles here. It is said that this visit was initiated by Roosevelt. The content of the talks has not been officially released. American political figures believe that Italy's attitude towards the current European war was discussed, and that this meeting is part of President Roosevelt's new policy initiative. This policy was hinted at when Roosevelt and the Italian King exchanged telegrams and when a special envoy to the Vatican was appointed. They claim that President Roosevelt is still considering the possibility of launching a peace movement and is therefore first seeking to ascertain the attitudes of Italy and the Vatican towards an American peace movement through the Italian Ambassador.

<h3>Soviet Army Adopts Long-Term Strategy Due to Strong Resistance in Finland, Continued Artillery Battles Between Two Armies in Karelian Isthmus, Soviet Aircraft Bomb Finnish Industrial Center Yesterday</h3>
<p>Helsinki - The Soviet authorities seem hesitant about what new strategy to adopt in the face of extremely strong resistance to their recent offensive against Finland. The transfer of fresh troops from the Soviet interior has not been completed quickly due to transportation difficulties. At the same time, Soviet military leaders have now realized that Finland is difficult to conquer in the short term and have therefore adopted a long-term strategy. As a result, Soviet troops in the Karelian Isthmus are now beginning to build fortifications and barracks for long-term garrisoning. At the same time, aerial bombardment has been greatly reduced. Today, nine Soviet aircraft dropped 22 bombs on the town of Vokii (near the Kovala railway) between Helsinki and Viipuri, destroying ten houses and killing two civilians and injuring sixteen. Other places were also bombed, with unknown results. (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>London - A spokesman for the Finnish Embassy in London stated that Finnish troops have penetrated 10 to 15 miles into Soviet territory in the Lappola area and have been fighting inside Soviet territory for several days. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Helsinki - The General Headquarters issued a battle report stating: (1) In the Karelian Isthmus, artillery fire was quite intense last night. The Red Army attacked Kivessilmä along the Zobe River but was repelled by our troops. 150 Red Army soldiers were killed. (2) On the eastern front, there was considerable activity by artillery and patrols north of Lake Ladoga. The Red Army's counterattack on the town of Itokijoki has been repelled. In the Suomussalmi district, our troops continued sweeping operations. A Red Army unit of 250 soldiers was annihilated. (3) Soviet aircraft flew to Abo, Hango Island, and various places in the north today, dropping bombs. Our losses were minimal. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Moscow - According to a communiqué issued by the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, there were no major developments on the front line five days ago. Reconnaissance units of both sides were active in the areas of Ukhtua, Petrozavodsk, and Repola. Soviet reconnaissance units killed 50 enemy soldiers in Petrozavodsk. There was also artillery fire and reconnaissance activity in the Karelian Isthmus. The Soviet Air Force bombed enemy storage depots and military targets with great success. (TASS dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Helsinki - The Leningrad Military District of the Soviet Union previously spread rumors that Finnish troops had begun a counteroffensive and were about to attack Leningrad, causing great panic among the residents there. Red Army patrols were stationed in the streets and alleys, and security lines were set up around various institutions. People are arrested daily for absenteeism. As for Kronstadt, which geographically serves as an outpost for the Leningrad Military District, civilians have begun to evacuate in preparation for any eventuality. In addition, the situation in Murmansk in northern Soviet Union is also extremely tense. Restrictions on travelers are even more severe than before. The railway there is entirely for military use, and passenger trains have been suspended. It is also reported that Soviet-made American-style aircraft require American fuel. Since the US morally prohibited the export of fuel to the Soviet Union, the source has been cut off. Since Soviet factories do not know the composition of this fuel and cannot manufacture it themselves, panic has arisen in the air force. Soviet aircraft have been less active recently, probably for this reason. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Helsinki - According to reports received here, nine Soviet bombers attacked the Finnish industrial center of Voega yesterday, dropping 22 bombs, destroying ten houses, killing two civilians, and injuring sixteen. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)</p>

The commander's act of treason was soon exposed, and he committed suicide in fear of punishment. Several accomplices were shot. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3>Visit of the Burmese Delegation to China: China's Heroic Resistance to Japan Can Lead to Ultimate Victory and Become a Leader in the World Commonwealth Movement</h3>
<p>Chongqing Air Dispatch: The Burmese delegation to China, led by U Ba Lwin and others, has been busy with visits and banquets since arriving in Chongqing, showering praise and gratitude, warming this winter mountain city. However, what are their concrete impressions of us? This is a question everyone needs to know. On the eve of the delegation's departure from Chongqing to Chengdu, the reporter made a farewell visit.</p>
<p>Two minutes after the white-clad attendant took the card upstairs, hurried and joyful footsteps echoed on the stairs. The footsteps stopped in front of the reporter, but the reporter was puzzled—the person standing in front of the reporter and shaking hands enthusiastically was no longer the Burmese friend wearing a floral silk turban and a Burmese-style jacket, but a man wearing a blue mandarin jacket and a black vest, and a woman (Ms. Daw Mya Sein) wearing a Chinese-made black velvet long cheongsam.</p>
<p>"What do you think? Don't you recognize me?" said U Ba Lwin, the head of the delegation, smiling, as if meeting an old friend after a long separation, shaking hands even tighter. "This was given to us by Chairman Chiang." At this moment, he, who was innocent and sincere, also seemed a little proud.</p>
<p>"You must be very busy, visiting here in the morning and there in the afternoon," the reporter turned the topic to the main subject.</p>
<p>"Yes, we are all very excited. We have only been in your country for eight or nine days, but what we have learned and experienced is at least more than in any previous eight or nine years." So everyone expressed their opinions to their heart's content.</p>
<p>First of all, they expressed their greatest joy and hope for China's solidarity. They said that this was due to the wise leadership of Chairman Chiang. Chairman Chiang united all the Chinese people around him, laying a solid foundation for China, and on that foundation, the whole country marched towards a bright and happy future.</p>
<p>Such a China, the powerful help she will be able to give to her fellow peace-loving neighbors, should be the common wish and belief of the people of both countries. The establishment of the China-Burma Cultural Association in Chongqing today is equivalent to laying a foundation for China and Burma. We must build houses well and promote and develop the ideas and culture of the two countries. They also said that the establishment of the China-Burma Cultural Association is the most valuable of their many valuable gains on this trip.</p>
<p>They also expressed their warm admiration for China's industry and commerce—industry and commerce that are becoming increasingly strong and powerful in the war of resistance: "Before we visited your country's shipbuilding industry, we simply couldn't imagine that all the machinery related to the war of resistance and national construction was made by your country."</p>
<p>As for China's education and culture—education and culture that have been wantonly destroyed by Japanese ambitions and aggression—they believe that it is enough to make people feel excited and even more to be used as a model. In particular, the Chinese press has also demonstrated its arduous and glorious mission in the war of resistance. Most of the newspaper offices in various places have been bombed by Japanese planes, but their answer is to continue to struggle in a more powerful way, without a moment of slackness, contributing their reporting duties. U Ba Lwin, who has been engaged in journalism in Burma for 20 years and has always spoken out for China's war of resistance, once again mentioned his cooperation method between the Chinese and Burmese press: frequent contact and mutual provision of information. At his request, the Joint Committee of Newspapers here wrote an open letter to the Burmese press. In addition to being willing to bring this "good news," U Ba Lwin is also willing to continue to expose Japan's false propaganda in Burma as his own responsibility.</p>
<p>The deputy head of the delegation, Ms. Daw Mya Sein, repeatedly expressed her admiration for the bravery of Chinese women. He said: This is indeed a very necessary fact. If women want to fight for independence, freedom, and equality, the nation must first be completely liberated, and half of the responsibility for the complete liberation of the nation lies with women, who account for half of humanity. Burmese and Chinese women should establish close ties in culture, art, and all aspects, and exchange their experiences and lessons in fighting for the independence and freedom of their motherland.</p>
<p>The number of overseas Chinese living in Burma exceeds 300,000, accounting for 40% of the total population of Burma. Due to their noble character and hard work, they have given the Burmese people a very good impression and influence. U Ba Lwin, the head of the delegation, told a joke to prove that this was the case: "Otherwise, why would most Burmese women be willing to marry Chinese men?"</p>
<p>The actions of overseas Chinese in Burma to resist Japan in the motherland were first to call on people throughout India and Burma to boycott Japanese goods, and then to establish the "China-Burma Buddhist Federation," which distributed news in both Chinese and Burmese. In addition, it also united 13 charitable organizations throughout Burma to establish a "Burma Disaster Relief Association," which specializes in donating medicine and money to China, and has remitted 6 million kyats in cash. Overseas Chinese women also established an "International Women's Association" to do various kinds of work related to the war of resistance. During the two years of the war of resistance, they held 360 "Chinese Meal" charity sales, that is, using Chinese cooking that foreigners like to eat to exchange for donations from friendly countries, and remitted them to China to resist Japan, which was very impressive.</p>
<p>In short, under the circumstances that China has been fighting for independence and freedom for three years and has already obtained the foundation for victory, the Burmese people have already given a ruthless response to all the political, economic, cultural, and even transportation conspiracies of the Japanese warlords in Burma, and of course, they will not have the slightest politeness or concession in the future. The ultimate goal of China's heroic resistance to Japan is to lay the cornerstone of world peace. Therefore, China's resolute and heroic resistance to Japan can not only achieve victory, not only establish a great and glorious strong country, but also become a leader in the world commonwealth movement.</p>
<p>The lights in the living room seemed particularly bright at this moment, exchanging brilliance with the faces of the excited people. However, it was getting late, and when we said goodbye reluctantly, U Ba Lwin also wrote a few words in Burmese for a colleague to use as the end:</p>
<p>"If a pair of flying crows are still not happy in a golden cage, then how can a country be happy under the rule of another country?"</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Harass Zhumen Area of Nantian County Again</h3>
<p>Nantian Dispatch: On the 19th of last month, a Japanese warship appeared off the coast of Hua'ao in this county and sent out a speedboat to attempt to land at Jin Gao Yi in this county, but was repelled by the Chinese army's self-defense force. Unexpectedly, the next morning, the Japanese warship continued to send out three small speedboats carrying more than 40 soldiers to spy on Jin Gao Yi again. The self-defense force, upon receiving the report, immediately divided up to meet the enemy. After a fierce battle for three hours, the Japanese soldiers failed. The Japanese warship then sailed into the inner harbor and fired more than ten shells, bombarding fiercely. Another 80 Japanese soldiers were secretly landed at Zhudou and other places, and they broke into Longquan Town to search house by house. At 3 pm, reinforcements from the self-defense force arrived and launched a brave counterattack. After a fierce battle for more than an hour, the Japanese soldiers fled back to the original warship in a panic. In this battle, three Chinese soldiers were killed or wounded, and two were missing. More than ten Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, and their bodies were dragged back to the original warship. They raised anchor and sailed away.</p>

<p>What is particularly surprising is the case of the attempted attack on Mr. Phillips by thugs yesterday. Mr. Phillips usually abides by the law and has a gentle attitude. All parties have a good impression of him. It is really unclear why the thugs did this. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Narrow Escape in the Early Morning</p>
<p>At about 9:15 yesterday morning, Mr. Phillips was driven out by the chauffeur Wu Jin-gen in his own car No. 4160. At that time, two rickshaw pullers were wandering in front of No. 493. When they saw Mr. Phillips' car driving out, the two rickshaw pullers rushed out of the Zhujia Ku Lane across from the Bai Sai Zhong Road, pulling their rickshaws and pretending to run across the road when the car drove in front of them, and immediately shouted. Unexpectedly, the rickshaw pullers still ran forward, one of them stopped in front of Mr. Phillips' car and blocked the car body, and the other drove to the left side of the car. The vehicles they were pulling collided with Mr. Phillips' car, and the disguised rickshaw puller took advantage of the unpreparedness of Mr. Phillips' chauffeur and suddenly drew a pistol and fired a shot at Mr. Phillips. Mr. Phillips suddenly heard the gunshot and quickly dodged. Then the thug fired three shots in a row. Finally, because the thug's aiming skills were poor, although there were four bullets in total, Mr. Phillips was fortunately not injured.</p>
<p>The Murderer Removed his Disguise and Fled in Panic</p>
<p>After the thug fired four shots in a row, the chauffeur Wu Jin-gen of Mr. Phillips' car was safe and sound, and he had already turned the car out of the state of being surrounded by two rickshaws and drove forward quickly. Therefore, although Mr. Phillips' car was hit by bullets, Mr. Phillips and his chauffeur were unharmed. After the murderer saw the chauffeur driving away at full speed, there were more than ten gunshots, as dense as a string of beads. Then he ran into Zhujia Ku Lane, fled into a nearby thatched house, and removed his rickshaw puller's clothing in a panic. According to another source, the murderer was captured by Zhang, a bodyguard of the Xinxin Entertainment Ground nearby, and taken to the special service agency there. However, after investigations by all parties, the agency has always kept silent about this matter, so it has not been possible to obtain proof of where the detained thug is currently.</p>
<p>Eight Bullet Holes in Mr. Phillips' Car</p>
<p>After this incomprehensible and shocking major case occurred, Mr. Phillips escaped danger and went to the bureau to handle official business as usual. Immediately, Mr. Phillips and the detective of the police station went to the scene of the incident to investigate and found nine bullet casings. As for Mr. Phillips' car, it was found to have as many as eight bullet holes. It is heard that the concession permits installed on the two rickshaws were forged, which proves that the thugs had a conspiracy about this matter long ago. The police stations of the Public Concession and the French Concession attach great importance to this case and are working hard to investigate it, and clues should be obtained soon.</p>
<p>The Thugs' Target Remains to be Determined</p>
<p>It is reported that before the thugs attacked Mr. Phillips, they had been wandering around Mr. Phillips' residence at around 4 am on the 6th. Although there were only two thugs who fired the pistol yesterday morning, there were as many as six or seven people watching the wind nearby at the same time. Before firing the gun, the thugs looked at Mr. Phillips, so it can be known that their target of attack was a Westerner. However, although they looked at Mr. Phillips, it has not been determined whether their target of attack was Mr. Phillips. It is not known whether the thugs had actually identified Mr. Phillips himself before firing the gun and then attacked him.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign People Expressed Their Condolences</p>
<p>After the news of Mr. Phillips' sudden attack by thugs spread, Chinese and foreign leaders went to the Public Works Department to express their condolences one after another. Although Mr. Phillips was frightened, he still handled matters as usual and his attitude was very calm. Mrs. Phillips learned of her husband's escape at her residence until noon and expressed her joy to the visiting guests and thanked her friends for their enthusiasm and concern in visiting her. It is reported that Mr. Phillips does not know of any grievances. It is impossible to speculate on the motive for someone attacking him this time. According to Mr. Phillips' statement to the Associated Press reporter, he believes that he has no enemies, so he has no precautions against this matter.</p>
<p>Reports in Western Newspapers that the Thugs Were Arrested</p>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening Post reported that Mr. Phillips, the Director-General and CEO of the Public Works Department, was suddenly attacked by three thugs disguised as rickshaw pullers who fired no fewer than eight shots at him when he took a car from his residence at No. 633 Haige Road to the bureau this morning (the 6th). However, the chauffeur was very alert. Upon hearing two gunshots, he drove away at full speed, so Mr. Phillips and the chauffeur were not injured. It was later learned that the three thugs had been arrested in a lane on Haige Road after committing the crime. The Public Concession Police Department is trying to detain the three thugs. However, as of the afternoon, it is still a mystery where the arrested thugs are. Major General Simmons, the commander of the British army stationed in Shanghai, has protested to the Japanese military police authorities about the attempted assassination of British personnel in the British army defense zone. The process of this case is as follows: Mr. Phillips had just left his residence on Haige Road at 9:15 this morning when three thugs disguised as rickshaw pullers rushed out of the Zhujia Ku Lane across from the Bai Sai Zhong Road. The first thug tried to pull the rickshaw to the middle of the road to block the car's way. The second thug then fired a gun. When the chauffeur drove away at full speed, the two fired several more shots, and then ran into Zhujia Ku Lane, firing two more shots as a show of force, and fled into a nearby thatched house to change out of their rickshaw puller's clothing. The armed bodyguards of the nearby Xinxin Gambling Ground heard the gunshots and entered the thatched house to arrest them. After investigation by the police department, it was found that there were a total of six members of the gang. When the three thugs who participated in the shooting obtained the rickshaws, they sent the original rickshaw pullers to teahouses to drink tea. The three thugs set off to attack, and the other three guarded the side. According to previous reports that British Ambassador Sir Kerr had heard that someone was plotting to assassinate him, he asked the police department to provide special protection. The ambassador himself also wore a steel wire vest and had two policemen as bodyguards, accompanying the ambassador everywhere. He then obtained a bulletproof car equipped with thick glass and other equipment to ensure safety.</p>

<h3>More Than 500 Japanese Troops Marched in Hongkou Yesterday Morning, Rumored to Be Newly Transferred to China, Will Hold a Review Ceremony This Morning</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 7 o'clock, more than 500 Japanese naval and army troops, fully armed, gathered in a military camp in the eastern area of Shanghai, and set off for a march, turning into Huade Road via Yangshupu Road, following Broadway Road and turning into North Sichuan Road, directly to the Japanese military headquarters on Jiangwan Road before dispersing and returning to their headquarters. When the Japanese troops passed by, the traffic arteries and intersections were heavily guarded, and vehicles and pedestrians were prohibited from advancing. The troops participating in the march were led by a patrol of machine gun cars, followed by soldiers, and at the end were armored military vehicles and tanks. However, according to eyewitnesses, the team was quite disorganized, perhaps newly transferred from Japan to China. It is also reported that the Japanese naval and army and police units stationed in Shanghai will hold a review in Hongkou Park this morning.</p>
<h3>Shame and Honor Movement Encourages Shanghai Citizens to Value the Nation and Ethnicity, Hone Their Ambitions and Pledge to Be a Backing Force</h3>
<p>The Shame and Honor Movement Committee of all circles in this city believes that the great victory of the Chinese army in northern Guangdong is enough to prove the national policy of sure victory in the war of resistance and sure success in national construction. Moreover, it can be firmly believed without any doubt. In addition to congratulating the supreme commander and the front-line soldiers, it also wrote to the citizens of Shanghai, encouraging everyone to value the nation and ethnicity and to be the backing force of the government. The article said: Since last year</p>
<p>(Great Victory in Northern Hunan) since then, there have been frequent reports of victories in the provinces of Jin, Yu, E, Wan, and Gan. We deeply believe that two and a half years of resistance have made the Japanese sink deeper and deeper into the quagmire, and will eventually be unable to extricate themselves. Now that the new curtain of the 29th year has been unveiled, the southern section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway</p>
<p>(Another Great Victory) in this battle, tens of thousands of Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, more than 100 armored vehicles were destroyed, and steel helmets, guns, ammunition, and other military supplies were captured, piled up like mountains. The Japanese army's rout was even worse than the defeat in northern Hunan. The Japanese army spent months preparing</p>
<p>(To Show off Their Elite Troops) originally intending to regain in Guangdong what they lost in Hunan, but unexpectedly their collapse was so violent, which shows that they have been exhausted again and again. Our army is getting stronger and stronger as it fights. Facts prove that this year can be transformed from the stalemate stage of the war of resistance to the decisive stage of final victory. Moreover, it can be firmly believed without any doubt. However, the closer victory</p>
<p>(Closer and Closer) the hardships we will encounter will inevitably be doubled compared to the past. Only by sacrificing everything and overcoming the greatest difficulties can we reach the realm of brightness and happiness. All our compatriots must value the nation and ethnicity, hone their ambitions,</p>
<p>(Promote Shame and Honor) abide by their posts, firmly believe, pledge to be the backing force of the government, not be intimidated by power, not be tempted by profit, and continue to work hard to eliminate the masses, so as to achieve the goal of final victory.</p>
<h3>British Gunboat Scorpion Departs Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin Daily reported that the British gunboat Scorpion, which served as the flagship of Lieutenant General Holt, commander of the British Navy in the Yangtze River in 1937, has recently left Shanghai. According to the British government's policy of reducing the number of ships stationed in the Yangtze River in order to transfer officers and soldiers to serve elsewhere for military needs, most of the gunboats in the Yangtze River Fleet have been withdrawn.</p>
<h3>Dredging Work, Date of Resumption, Expected to Officially Resume Next Month</h3>
<p>According to the Datong News Agency reporter, since the Dredging Bureau was forced to reorganize, the original dredgers of the bureau have been detained by the Japanese. Except for some such as the Construction, which were returned last month, another part was returned yesterday, and there are also several survey vessels. However, all the above-mentioned ships need to be repaired, so it is difficult to start using them immediately.</p>
<p>Dredging Work to Resume Next Month</p>
<p>The survey department of the bureau is preparing to rush to survey the channel of the Huangpu River within this month, and plans to first survey the areas with the most severe siltation. At that time, the dredgers being repaired in the dock can be repaired and leave the dock. It is expected that dredging work can be officially resumed from the 1st of next month to facilitate navigation.</p>
<p>Notice of High Tide in the Huangpu River</p>
<p>According to the hydrology department of the bureau, the amount of high tide will be above 10 feet from the 8th to the 11th of this month, and the tide time will be in the afternoon, so the water flow will be particularly turbulent, reaching 3.2 nautical miles per hour. Attention should be paid to the sailing of sails.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Goods Transported to Wenzhou Must Submit Commercial Certificates for Inspection, Otherwise They Must Be Investigated</h3>
<p>After the successful trial voyage of the Shanghai-Wenzhou route by foreign shipping companies, the freight volume has gradually increased. The Oujiang Import and Export Goods Inspection Office, in order to check whether merchants purchase imported goods, in addition to those that can be imported in accordance with Article 3 of the Zhejiang Provincial Provisional Restriction on the Import and Export of Blockaded Shipping Goods, all others should apply for registration in accordance with the procedures stipulated in Article 5 of the Registration Inspection Measures and transfer them to the provincial government for approval before they can be imported. However, since Shanghai fell, the original state-run factories have been seized or controlled by the Japanese, making it difficult to distinguish between domestic goods and non-domestic goods, and it is easy to cause misunderstandings. In order to facilitate inspection, it has recently been stipulated that in the future, merchants who purchase imported domestic or foreign goods, whether or not they have been approved by the provincial government, must obtain certificates from the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and submit them together with the red declaration form for inspection and release. Otherwise, they must be approved after investigation. The Yongjia County Chamber of Commerce has been ordered to instruct merchants in various industries to strictly abide by this.</p>
<h3>The Bond Market is Thriving, Credit is Becoming More Solid, 80% of Customs Duties Were Intercepted Last Year, Relying on the National Government to Maintain Creditworthiness Unaffected</h3>
<p>The brokerage firms and securities firms affiliated to the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange were originally operating normally in the gray market of public bonds. Since the unprecedented victory in northern Hunan, the bond market has been thriving. Now that the entire line in northern Guangdong has been won, the prices of the unified public bonds issued by the country have also soared. People from all walks of life, with the frequent news of the victory in the war of resistance, are willing to buy and sell a large number of national public bonds. In order to facilitate customers' contact, securities firms have started to specialize in the business of unified public bonds, and the situation is extremely enthusiastic, showing that the future of our war of resistance has shown brightness.</p>
<p>According to statistics, in the past three days, the prices of unified bonds of various types have risen by two or three yuan, which is also due to the solid creditworthiness of the bonds. As for the Japanese interception of various customs duties guaranteeing national bonds, although the amount is huge, fortunately the national government has been prepared and has not been affected in the slightest.</p>
<p>A Huge Amount of Customs Duties Was Intercepted</p>
<p>Since the customs offices in the war zone fell, the tax revenue has been intercepted by the Japanese and has never been remitted to the General Taxation Department, Mr. Meierhe. According to last year's calculations, the taxes intercepted from the Jianghai Customs, the Donghai Customs, etc., amounted to more than 273.93 million yuan in national currency. The tax revenues have been intercepted by the Yokohama Specie Bank, a Japanese bank, and the original tax collectors of the Central Bank in the customs offices have been forced to withdraw. The national tax revenue last year was 331.32 million yuan, and the amount intercepted accounted for 80% of the total.</p>
<p>All Funds Forcibly Deposited in Japanese Banks</p>
<p>The government has always fulfilled its debt obligations on schedule, especially the various customs-guaranteed loans, which have never been delayed. Since the tax revenue of the customs offices in the war zone has been seized by the Japanese and all funds have been forcibly deposited in Japanese banks, the funds to be allocated to each customs office have never been remitted as scheduled. Therefore, a notice was issued in January last year on the measures for customs duty debt repayment, and the domestic debts guaranteed by customs surplus, (1) the 25th-year Unified Public Bonds, (2) the 25th-year Recovery Public Bonds, and (3) the 17th-year Gold Long Public Bonds, the principal and interest due last year were completely suspended and transferred to the National Debt Fund Management Committee for preparation.</p>
<p>Four Banks Discount to Maintain Creditworthiness</p>
<p>In order to maintain the creditworthiness of domestic debts, the four banks, including the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China, allow discounting and payment of the principal and interest due on the three types of domestic debts guaranteed by customs surplus: Unified, Recovery, and Gold Long. The eighth principal and interest payment of the five types of unified public bonds A, B, C, D, and E have been scheduled to be discounted and paid from January 31. The eighth principal repayment of the Recovery Public Bonds will be held on the 10th of this month, and the discounting and payment will be made from February 29. The 23rd principal repayment of the Financial Long-Term Public Bonds will be held on the 10th of March, and the discounting and payment will be made from March 31. Detailed measures will be announced by the Ministry at that time.</p>
<h3>Local Russians Celebrate Festivals</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that Shanghai Russians will celebrate Christmas Eve tonight (the 6th) and Christmas on the 7th, according to the old Russian calendar, and New Year's Day on January 14. Russians are very lively every time these festivals come, no less than other foreigners. Russian churches in Shanghai will hold special services tomorrow (the 7th).</p>
<h3>Internal Decision on Fair Price Rice Measures Date: From the 10th day of the 12th lunar month Location: 50 locations to be set up in the two concessions</h3>
<p>After the establishment of the Shanghai Fair Price Rice Committee, it has been actively soliciting fair price rice funds from various industries, expanding its organization, and hiring enthusiastic individuals as committee members. Simultaneously, it has purchased 16,000 bags of Saigon broken rice from the market and telegraphed Saigon to order 15,000 bags of foreign rice. It has internally decided to commence fair price rice distribution starting from February 18th (i.e., the 10th day of the 12th lunar month), with a total of 50 fair price rice distribution points, including 30 in the International Settlement and 20 in the French Concession, entrusted to the Shanghai Rice Merchants Association for management.</p>
<p>Rice Merchants Association Discusses Measures</p>
<p>After deciding to entrust the Rice Merchants Association with the management of fair price rice distribution, the association held a temporary joint meeting of directors and supervisors at its office on Shanhai Pass Road at 3:00 PM yesterday. Attendees included Lu Wen Shao, Qu Zhen Hua, Shi Hong Dong, Pan Ji Bin, Chen Shao Lian, Zhang He Ming, and others. Zhang Nian Xuan, the chairman, reported the purpose of the meeting. Subsequently, the matter of managing fair price rice distribution was discussed. All committee members expressed their support in principle for the distribution, considering it related to the relief of the common people. Zhang Nian Xuan and Lu Wen Shao were appointed to liaise with the Fair Price Rice Committee on specific measures, and the meeting adjourned at 4:30 PM.</p>
<p>Fair Price Rice Committee to Meet Today</p>
<p>The Fair Price Rice Committee has scheduled a committee meeting for 1:00 PM today at the Shipping Club on Guangdong Road. It will elect 11 standing committee members and issue a declaration detailing the purpose of fair price rice distribution, hoping that various industries will actively donate to ensure the sustained operation of fair price rice distribution. In addition, specific measures for fair price rice distribution will be discussed. Committee members Chu Qia Qing, Chen Zi Shen, Wang Yu Qing, and Zhang Nian Xuan, among others, held an informal discussion at the Shipping Club at 4:00 PM yesterday, deciding to actively solicit fair price rice funds from various industries. It is reported that various commercial organizations have mobilized to solicit donations from their members.</p>
<p>People's Food Association Purchases Rice in Bulk</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from relevant sources that regarding the regulation of food supply for Shanghai residents, (1) rice will be ordered in bulk by the People's Food Association, and (2) fair price rice distribution will be managed by the Fair Price Rice Committee. The progress of fair price rice distribution has been described above. Regarding bulk rice purchases, the People's Food Association has already registered rice orders. Numerous organizations, agencies, companies, firms, and factories are applying to order. The first batch of 600 tons has been telegraphed to Saigon for ordering and will arrive in Shanghai before the end of this month. The second batch will soon be telegraphed to Saigon for ordering. Banks and financial institutions have agreed to provide advances for bulk rice purchases.</p>
<p>Market Rice Prices Have Trended Stable</p>
<p>Since the People's Food Regulation Association and the Fair Price Rice Committee ordered foreign rice in bulk and raised funds for fair price rice distribution, public confidence in Shanghai's rice supply has stabilized. The rush to buy rice has disappeared. Rice prices in the bean, rice, and tea markets have trended stable. At the same time, the authorities of the two concessions have shown great determination to maintain the food supply and suppress speculation. As a result, the general public dares not manipulate or hoard rice. In addition, foreign rice is steadily arriving in Shanghai. In addition to the rice that has already arrived, there are still 80,000 bags that will arrive before January 15th. In recent days, due to the easing of foreign exchange rates, many have continued to order foreign rice. Therefore, there is no need to worry about Shanghai residents' food supply in the future.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Patrol Ships Reiterate Demands for Return</h3>
<p>After the Japanese released the Jianghai Customs patrol ship "Lianxing," more than ten other patrol ships, ranging from the cruiser flagship "Fuxing" downwards, were still requisitioned by the Japanese, and their whereabouts remain unclear. It is now learned that the Jianghai Customs Commissioner, Robert Bredon, has once again raised the issue of returning the ships with the Japanese in order to strengthen the force for suppressing smuggling. However, according to general observation, it is difficult to achieve a positive outcome.</p>
<h3>Two-Cent Auxiliary Currency Notes Found to Be Counterfeit</h3>
<p>Recently, counterfeit two-cent auxiliary currency notes of the Central Bank have suddenly appeared on the market, deceiving the public and causing considerable losses. These counterfeit two-cent notes are of very poor paper quality, with blurred lines and a darker color. With a little attention, it is possible to distinguish the genuine from the fake. Fortunately, citizens are paying attention.</p>
<h3>Japanese Steel Panic Scouring for Iron Materials in China Iron Stored at Jiangnan Shipyard All Seized Commercial Iron Factory Machinery Also Looted</h3>
<p>After two and a half years of intense fighting between China and Japan, the Japanese side's domestic steel has been almost completely depleted. Therefore, they are actively scouring for metals such as copper, iron, and steel in the occupied areas of China, sparing no effort. Recently, they have further established a so-called "Iron Manufacturing Joint Stock Company," specializing in the purchase of iron parts and machinery, using ruffians and other unsavory characters to carry out their activities everywhere. This shows that the Japanese steel panic has reached an extreme point. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Iron Stored at Jiangnan All Seized</p>
<p>The state-run Jiangnan Shipyard in Gaochangmiao had a large quantity of iron parts stored during the war. Due to their bulkiness, they could not be moved out in time, and they fell into the hands of the Japanese. Initially, the factory was renamed Mitsubishi Shipyard, and it began repairing damaged Japanese ships. Later, due to the excessive amount of ammunition consumed by the Japanese army at the front line, domestic iron materials became increasingly scarce. As a result, the iron stored in the Jiangnan Shipyard was completely removed, including some iron parts that were hidden at the foot of Dama Mountain during the war. Therefore, the Jiangnan Shipyard suffered significant damage.</p>
<p>Commercial Hongchang Also Suffers Greatly</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the Japanese have redoubled their efforts, establishing the so-called "Iron Manufacturing Joint Stock Company" last year, extensively collecting iron parts, and further coveting the iron parts in iron factories established by purely merchants in an attempt to make up for their iron shortage. According to investigations, a large number of machines and iron materials in the Hongchang Iron Factory, a commercial enterprise in the Nanshi area, were also collected by the "Iron Manufacturing Joint Stock Company." Subsequently, the factory discovered this and, through various means, reported it to the puppet authorities for investigation. The result was that only three ruffians, Hu Fu Hai, Wang Xing An, and Tang Jiao Zhou, were blamed, claiming that they had stolen and sold all the machines and iron materials of the factory to the "Iron Manufacturing Company," obtaining 3,600 yuan and escaping, making it impossible to pursue the matter.</p>
<p>Iron Storage Yard Also Established in Wusong</p>
<p>The iron materials obtained by the Japanese from various places in Jiangnan were originally piled up on wasteland next to the puppet "Fish Market" on Qiwupu Road in Yangshupu. Now, because that place is too conspicuous, it is inconvenient. Another piece of wasteland has been opened up at the northern end of Wenzaobang in Chengshong to store iron materials. Transport ships are then modified and moored in the Wusong River, and the iron parts are gradually transported back to their country for use. Therefore, in recent months, Japanese transport ships have no longer been seen loading iron materials in the Yangshupu area, and this is the reason.</p>

<h3>Kidnapping of the Owner of the Huacheng Printing House Arrest of the Chauffeur The Kidnapping Car Belongs to a Japanese Car Dealership The Driver, Jin Xing Cai, Arrested While Obtaining His License</h3>
<p>Mao Shu Jun, the owner of the Huacheng Printing House at 1228 Avenue Foch, was suddenly approached at 9:50 AM on December 29th of last year by three foreigners and one Chinese person in a patrol car numbered 18143. They accused Mao of printing anti-Japanese books, forced him into the car, and sped away. After the Jing'an Temple Police Station learned of the incident, Chief Detective Ni Jia Feng and Detective Weeks arrested Jin Xing Cai (resident of No. 14 Yuxiang Lane, Rue Albert), the driver at the time. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District and requested for detention. According to the prosecutor of the police station, Zhang Tian Yin, after learning that Mao Shu Jun was abducted along with 92 anti-Japanese books, the police station immediately launched an investigation. It was later learned that Mao had been detained at the Japanese Consulate and that the books were not anti-Japanese. The police station then brought Mao out of the Japanese Consulate. At that time, it was determined that the patrol car number 18143 belonged to a Japanese car company at 160 Chapoo Road in Hongkou, and Jin Xing Cai was the driver. Yesterday, Jin was arrested while obtaining his license at the motor vehicle office. The case is still under investigation, and detention is requested. Investigating Judge Lun Quan Xing Cai approved the detention for seven days for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Police Officers Defrauding People of Money One Culprit Arrested on the Spot</h3>
<p>Yuan Cheng Cloth Shop at No. 50 Longquan Garden Lane, established by Yu Shi Xun, was visited at 10:30 AM the day before yesterday by a Westerner and a Chinese man, claiming to be police officers. They claimed to have received a tip that Yu was selling drugs and had come to search. Yu, seeing that the Westerner was wearing what appeared to be a police uniform, did not suspect anything. The five men searched everywhere but could not find any drugs. However, they claimed that even if they could not find drugs, they could still arrest him unless he paid 500 yuan. At this point, Yu realized that these people were not police officers but imposters attempting to extort money. He secretly reported this to the Laozha Police Station. Chief Detective Yang De Chun rushed to the scene and arrested only Bao Yi Ming. The other four had already fled. Yesterday morning, Bao Yi Ming was escorted to the First Special Court. Prosecutor Ru Bao Yi requested a postponement because the accomplices were still at large. Bao confessed that he had seized a pack of heroin at the time and did not deny the attempted fraud. Judge Feng Shi De checked the confession and ordered Bao to be detained and the case postponed for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Armed Robbery on Wuding Road</h3>
<p>One Bandit Killed in Action Two Bandits Captured Alive</p>
<p>At approximately 7:00 PM yesterday, five bandits speaking with a Jiangbei accent suddenly broke into the Fang residence at No. 27, Lane 32 (i.e., Chunyi Lane), Wuding Road, to commit robbery. At the time, Wu, a tenant who was a student at Fangshan School, returned home and glimpsed the situation inside the house. He quickly crept out and ran outside to call for help. He happened to see two police patrol cars parked on the side of the road, and a large number of armed detectives were searching pedestrians. The student reported the situation, and more than ten detectives were immediately dispatched to the lane to conduct a search. They encountered the bandits at the entrance of the lane. In a panic, the bandits opened fire on the police. The detectives returned fire, and after exchanging five or six shots, one of the bandits was shot down by the detectives, and two bandits were captured alive. However, the remaining two bandits escaped from the chaotic crowd. The injured bandit died shortly after due to fatal injuries. The deceased bandit was identified as Chen Lao San from Jiangbei. The two captured bandits were Wang Xiao Er Zi and Zhuang Da Guan.</p>
<h3>Robbery of German Woman Four Culprits All Arrested</h3>
<p>Wang Zhang Tang, Zhang A Zhou, Sun Xin Fa (all from Ningbo), and Shen Bing Cheng (from Changzhou) recently lost their jobs and had no way to make a living. They became a criminal gang. At 10:30 AM the day before yesterday, they each held fake guns and hatchets and robbed a German woman, Frau Frietlandt, of a handbag containing 20 US dollars on Avenue Dengtuo. The German woman shouted, "Robbers!" Zhang A Zhou pulled out a hatchet and cut her forehead before the group scattered and fled. As a result, Chief Detective Wang Shu Pei and Zhang Lian Shou of the Hongkou Police Station worked together to track down and arrest Wang Zhang Tang and the other three. Along with the fake guns, two hatchets, and the original stolen handbag, they were taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special Court. Police Prosecutor Qian Xun Jiu requested detention and postponement of the investigation of other cases. Judge Jiang questioned the four defendants and ordered them to be detained and the case postponed for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Zhang Yi Shu Travels to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Arrived on the 5th</p>
<p>According to a Havas News Agency report from Shanghai, Zhang Yi Shu, the chief writer of the Chinese language section of the Shanghai Havas News Agency, was sent to Hong Kong by the agency to discuss the matter of publishing articles in the local Chinese newspapers. He arrived there on the 5th of this month.</p>
<h3>Mongolian Low-Pressure System Continues to Advance Shanghai Climate: Summer in Winter Recent Temperatures Rise to Over 70 Degrees High Pressure Forming, Weather Will Change Dramatically</h3>
<p>Due to the influence of a low-pressure system advancing southeast from Mongolia, the local weather is unusually warm, like early summer, and light clothing is suitable. However, a high-pressure system is forming in Siberia, so Shanghai's weather is likely to change dramatically.</p>
<p>Summer in Winter</p>
<p>According to a Datong News Agency reporter, local temperatures have risen to over 70 degrees Fahrenheit in recent days, resembling early summer. The weather is exceptionally warm, and light clothing is sufficient with no feeling of cold. This abnormal phenomenon is rare in the dead of winter. In previous years, by this time, the roads would have been covered in ice and snow.</p>
<p>Dramatic Change Imminent</p>
<p>According to observations from the observatory, the coldest temperatures in Siberia, Russia, have fallen to over 30 degrees Celsius below zero, indicating the formation of a high-pressure system. If it advances southeast, Shanghai's weather will change dramatically, and the onset of extreme cold is not far off. In addition, there has been very little rain this winter, and the climate is dry, so common illnesses such as colds and diphtheria are very prevalent. Residents should pay close attention to maintaining their health.</p>
<h3>The Closed Dachang Xieji Silk and Satin Store Manager Arrested for Embezzlement Over 20,000 Yuan in Funds Misappropriated Further Investigation of Accounts Pending</h3>
<p>Dachang Xieji Silk and Satin Store was formerly located at Xiaodongmen, Zhongnanshi, and was jointly established by Wang Zigang and others. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, it was relocated to No. 397 Nanjing Road and Shanxi Road (the original site of the current Dachangxiang Silk and Satin Store). In the autumn of last year, it suddenly experienced financial difficulties and closed. Wang Zigang entrusted an accountant</p>
<p>to audit the accounts and discovered that most of the store's capital had been transferred and lent to Dada Silk Store at No. 10, Lane 351, Fujian Road. Further investigation revealed that the Dada Silk Store was established by Wu Yun Xuan (from Suzhou), the store manager, and Yin Nian Chun (from Suzhou), the assistant manager, who used their positions and opportunities to transfer Dachang's capital to their own store, causing Dachang</p>
<p>to close down. This was in violation of the store's regulations, which stipulated that capital could not be used for other purposes. Further investigation revealed that the amount of misappropriated funds was over 23,539 yuan. The report was made to the General Police Station, and Chief Detective Jiang Shang Pei and Detective Song Yuan Shan investigated and confirmed the facts. Wu and Yin were arrested the day before yesterday and escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Wu and Yin hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu En Liang for their defense. The police prosecutor, Ru Bao Yi, stated that the accounts in this case were complex and the investigation would take time, so he requested a postponement to allow sufficient time for a detailed investigation. After questioning by Judge Feng Shi De, it was ordered that both Wu and Yin be detained for one week for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Fire in Caoyang Road Shantytowns Yesterday</h3>
<p>At approximately 4:45 PM yesterday, a fire broke out in the shantytowns of Caoyang Road's Wujiaochang, Shanghai West, which housed over a thousand poor families. The flames soared, and the residents fled in all directions. The Caoyang Road Fire Brigade, together with the Central Fire Brigade, dispatched vehicles to extinguish the fire. It was not extinguished until 10:00 PM. It is estimated that 400-500 shacks were destroyed, as well as many shops and factories. Whether anyone perished in the fire is currently being investigated by the fire brigade personnel, who are sifting through the rubble.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Dismantling of Storefront Window Self-Demolisher Arrested</h3>
<p>Wu Xian Qing (from Ningbo), the owner of the Hongda Hat Shop at the intersection of Sanma Road and Shilu Road, previously leased the storefront window of the Nanyang Shoe Store at No. 565, Route du Consulat, from Qu Yu Chang, the owner of the Nanyang Shoe Store, to sell hats. He had also leased a pavilion room as a warehouse and dormitory for his employees for many years. Recently, Qu transferred the Nanyang Shoe Store to Wang Guang Yu, who opened the Dahua Shoe and Hat Store. After Qu asked Wu to vacate the premises, Wu dismantled the copper-framed chrome hat racks and other equipment he had installed. Wang Guang Yu reported this to the French Police, accusing Wu of theft. Wu did not go to the police station for questioning, but instead hired a lawyer to file a private prosecution with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing Wang Guang Yu of falsely accusing him of theft and requesting an investigation. The court held a hearing the day before yesterday. The plaintiff was represented by a lawyer who presented the case and stated that the plaintiff feared that the defendant would notify the police to wait outside the court to arrest him and subject him to torture. Therefore, he did not appear in court. The defendant appeared in court with his lawyers Xu Wu Fang and Chen Hai Sen. After the court admonished the parties, the hearing was postponed for further questioning. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that the plaintiff, Wu Xian Qing, was present with his lawyer at the time of the hearing. During the hearing, he sat in the audience and listened to the proceedings, deliberately not appearing in court and having his lawyer state the reasons for his absence. However, after Wu walked out of the courthouse, detectives from the French Police Station were waiting outside to arrest him. He was taken to the Loujiawan General Police Station. After questioning by the Western Inspector, he was instructed to await investigation and be escorted to the court for review.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Sima Road Handgun Found Abandoned</h3>
<p>Four robbers who robbed the property of a certain family at No. 5, Lane 554, Hankou Road, were discovered by a patrolman when they fled to the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Fujian Road. The patrolman chased after them, and the robbers opened fire. One robber was shot several times by the patrolman and fell to the ground on the east side of the Tongxing Lou restaurant on Fuzhou Road.

It is now learned that when the robber and patrolmen exchanged gunfire, bullets flew everywhere, and the employees of various stores took refuge inside. At that time, a robber broke into the Lv Yi Ji Magazine and Newspaper Agency at No. 423. Seeing that the employees in the store had all taken refuge, and the gunfire on the street was intense, the robber took off his overcoat, wrapped a Mauser pistol in it, and abandoned it under the bookstore's counter. He then took advantage of the situation to escape without a trace. Afterwards, a store employee named Huang Wen Yuan discovered this and immediately reported it to the police station by telephone. Detectives were dispatched to retrieve the overcoat and Mauser pistol and to take the store owner, Mr. Wang (from Guangdong), the accountant, Lv Pei (from Shanghai), and Huang Wen Yuan to the police station for questioning.</p>

<h3>Glucose Calcium Reaction Issue Defendant's Rebuttal Reasons</h3>
<p>This newspaper published an article yesterday entitled "Strong Reaction Occurs After Injection of Glucose Calcium." The following are the supplemental rebuttal reasons from Mr. Wu Zhi Wei, the defendant, through his attorney, Mr. A. Le Man:</p>
<p>Dear Sir, This is to state that my client, Mr. Wu Zhi Wei, claims that he has read today's Shen Bao, which contains a news item about Dr. Yu Ting Xiang's private prosecution of me for negligent injury. The content focuses on the plaintiff's statements, while the defendant's rebuttals are omitted in detail, and some important facts of the case are not included. I am sincerely afraid that the general public will develop misunderstandings, and I should supplement as follows:</p>
<p>(1) This criminal private prosecution was filed after Dr. Yu requested compensation for damages, and I reasonably refused. In other words, if I had initially disregarded the truth and compromised and agreed to compensation, Dr. Yu would not have filed a criminal suit. However, I have a clear conscience and will naturally not succumb.</p>
<p>(2) The main reason Dr. Yu sued, believing I was at fault, was that Pro Strong Company of America is not a member of the American Medical Association, so I should not distribute its products. However, the association is the American Medical Association, and pharmaceutical manufacturers do not need to be and cannot join. Therefore, his reasons for prosecution are completely wrong.</p>
<p>(3) Pro Strong Company's glucose calcium products are sold worldwide and have an excellent reputation. If Dr. Yu believes that the company's products should not be used, why did he suddenly use them on his patient? Why did he use them on himself again after several days? Furthermore, if the drug is indeed improper, why can't Dr. Yu present any chemical evidence to prove his claim until the case is heard?</p>
<p>(4) Whether it is appropriate for Dr. Yu to inject glucose calcium for his own cold and cough is already questionable. Furthermore, whether the injection of the needle was timely, and whether the disinfection was thorough are all relevant. Now that the company's drugs have proven to be flawless, in fact, the cause of the reaction described by Dr. Yu should be investigated by Dr. Yu himself.</p>
<p>It has been determined that the case has now been debated and will be decided by the court on the 11th of this month. I deeply believe that justice is in the hearts of the people, and right and wrong are not difficult to clarify. There is no need to debate further now, but because the news item is easy to give the public an inaccurate impression, I should ask the lawyer to send a letter to the newspaper to request a supplementary correction. Accordingly, I have sent a letter on behalf of my client, hoping that you will review and handle it accordingly. Sincerely, Attorney A. Le Man, January 6, 29th year. The court ruled that the ruling will be delivered by public notice.</p>
<h3>Husband Files for Divorce Defendant Not Summoned</h3>
<p>The court ruled that the summons will be delivered by public notice.</p>
<p>Wang Shou Zhen (resident of No. 1, Xiyang Lane, Caishi Road), who works at the post office and is from Anhui, married Ma Yu Ying (25 years old from Shanghai) on October 3, 1928, through the introduction of matchmaker Li Wan Chun. They originally lived in Huaxing Lane, Zhabei. After the war, they moved to No. 1 Xishunyang Lane. Ma became addicted to gambling. Wang advised her to quit, but Ma ran away on her own. Although Wang posted an advertisement in the newspaper, Ma ignored it. Wang was helpless and hired lawyer Zhu Zhen Lu to file a petition with the Second Special Court, requesting a divorce. The court accepted the petition, and Judge Yu summoned the defendant Ma Yu Ying for questioning yesterday in the seventh court. The defendant Ma Yu Ying did not appear. The court ruled that the case be adjourned to February 17 for the defendant to be served with a public notice and reheard.</p>

<h3>An Overview of the Promotion of Compulsory Education in China (Part 3)</h3>
<p>(IV) Implementation Procedures</p>
<p>In accordance with the regulations of the Outline of the Compulsory Education Implementation Plan and its Detailed Rules, the implementation procedures for promoting compulsory education are as follows: Each county and city should first divide elementary school districts as units for establishing elementary schools, investigate the number of school-age children to enforce school attendance, organize compulsory education committees at all levels to assist education administrative organs at all levels in implementing compulsory education, strengthen education administrative structures at all levels to facilitate the promotion of compulsory education, and establish compulsory education supervisors to specifically oversee compulsory education. The various measures are outlined below:</p>
<p>A. Division of Elementary School Districts. Regarding the division of elementary school districts, the Measures for the Division of Elementary School Districts in Cities and Counties have been formulated and revised, stipulating that each elementary school district should have a population of 1,000 people in principle. However, local areas may flexibly adapt this based on the population density, local transportation conditions, and existing local self-governance or Baojia organizations. Five to ten elementary school districts are combined into a joint elementary school district with one school director. Each elementary school district has one assistant school director responsible for investigating school-age children in the district, planning schools, persuading or forcing children to attend school, and raising funds to supervise and improve private schools. Every three or more joint elementary school districts or each autonomous region should be divided into a county school district, with one education committee member to guide all educational matters within the district.</p>
<p>B. Organization of Compulsory Education Committees at All Levels. The National Compulsory Education Committee, an agency assisting the Ministry of Education in promoting national compulsory education, was established in August of the 24th year [of the Republic]. In addition to the Minister, Vice Minister, counselors, supervisors, and section chiefs serving as ex officio members according to regulations, several experts from outside the Ministry are also appointed as members. Its main tasks include developing and reviewing compulsory education implementation plans, reviewing all regulations and measures related to compulsory education, and evaluating the performance of compulsory education in various provinces and cities. The organizational regulations of the committee were revised in the 26th year [of the Republic] and this year [of the Republic], and staff have recently been added to strengthen the organization to facilitate progress. Provincial and municipal compulsory education committees, agencies assisting provincial and municipal education departments in promoting compulsory education in their respective provinces and cities, were also established in the 24th year [of the Republic]. In addition to the heads of provincial and municipal education administrative agencies serving as chairmen, section chiefs and supervisors serve as ex officio members, and several respected figures from the education sector are appointed as members by the provincial and municipal governments. Their tasks include formulating provincial compulsory education implementation plans, supervising the management and use of provincial and municipal compulsory education funds and central government subsidies for compulsory education in the provinces and cities, drafting annual teacher training methods, and evaluating the performance of compulsory education in various counties and cities. County and city compulsory education committees, agencies assisting county and city education bureaus in promoting compulsory education in their respective counties and cities, have been established in most counties across the country. Their tasks include formulating county and city compulsory education promotion plans, supervising the management and use of county and city compulsory education funds and subsidies from higher-level governments, and evaluating the performance of compulsory education in subordinate areas. Recently, in accordance with the resolutions of the Third National Education Conference, the National Compulsory Education Committee is formulating mutual liaison and guidance measures for compulsory education committees at various levels below the provincial level to strengthen their organization.</p>
<p>C. Strengthening Education Administrative Structures at All Levels. Regarding the administration of compulsory education at all levels, in the 25th year [of the Republic], provincial and municipal education departments were ordered to establish special compulsory education sections or compulsory education units within the primary education sections. County education bureaus were instructed to assign one staff member to handle compulsory education specifically. In addition to the original supervisors conducting inspections on a regular basis, compulsory education supervisors may be appointed at any time to supervise compulsory education in various provinces and cities. Furthermore, regulations for compulsory education supervisors in provinces, cities, and counties were issued, stipulating that each province and city should establish several compulsory education supervisors to supervise compulsory education by region, and each county and city should establish several compulsory education supervisors to supervise compulsory education in the county and city by region, to facilitate the supervision and guidance of compulsory education promotion. Recently, with the promulgation of the Outline of County-Level Organizations, there have been slight changes to the county education administrative organization. The Ministry of Education is currently working on formulating an outline of the county education administrative organization to facilitate implementation.</p>
<p>D. Training Administrative Cadres for Compulsory Education. In the 25th year [of the Republic], provincial and municipal education departments were ordered to send administrative personnel in charge of compulsory education, current or prospective leaders of compulsory education teacher training classes, to the Ministry to participate in training courses for administrative cadres of compulsory education. The training period lasted for two months. In addition to inviting experts to temporarily lecture on compulsory education issues, the focus was on the discussion of practical problems. The results of the discussions were quite impressive and were compiled into a collection of discussions on practical issues in compulsory education, which was distributed to various provinces and cities. Almost all difficult problems in promoting compulsory education have solutions in this collection, making it a valuable reference for education agencies in various provinces and cities. After the promulgation of the Outline of County-Level Organizations, various provinces and cities should establish public national schools and township (zhen) central schools on a wide scale. The large number of teachers required should be trained quickly through widely established teacher training classes in the respective provinces and cities. Personnel responsible for operating these teacher training classes should first be centrally gathered for training. The Ministry of Education is currently formulating training methods and will periodically convene training in batches.</p>
<p>(V) Implementation Methods</p>
<p>According to the provisions of the Outline of the Compulsory Education Plan and the Detailed Rules for Implementation, various provinces should promote compulsory education by establishing short-term elementary schools and elementary schools to accommodate out-of-school children in various regions. The methods are as follows:</p>
<p>A. Establishing Short-Term Elementary Schools on a Wide Scale. In areas where education funding is insufficient, within the designated school districts, one-year short-term elementary schools should first be established to enroll out-of-school children aged eight to twelve. These schools should adopt a two-shift system in principle, with each shift teaching for half a day (or adopting alternate-day or intermittent teaching), with each shift teaching for at least three or four hours. The duration of study is one year in the first phase, two years in the second phase, and gradually converting to four-year elementary schools in the third phase.</p>
<p>B. Promoting Four-Year Elementary Schools. In areas where education funding is sufficient, there is no need to establish short-term elementary schools, and four-year elementary schools can be established instead.</p>
<p>C. Fully Utilizing Existing Elementary School Quotas. In all grades of existing elementary schools, if the number of students is insufficient, efforts must be made to enroll enough children to fill the quotas.</p>
<p>D. Improving Private Schools. All regions are required to improve existing private schools, with the teachers being gathered in batches for training in advance. Efforts must be made to ensure that all private schools are operated in accordance with the short-term elementary school methods.</p>
<p>E. Implementing Itinerant Teaching on a Trial Basis. All regions are ordered to establish itinerant teachers to go to remote and inaccessible areas to teach out-of-school children. The level of instruction should be the same as that of short-term elementary schools.</p>

<h3>Finance - Foreign Exchange Rises and Falls Rapidly - British Gold Briefly Drops Five Pence and Then Recovers - US Exchange Rate Repeatedly Falls Back into the Eight Yuan Range</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the HSBC official rates reveal a consistent long position. British gold was up by two and five forties of a penny, making it four and a half pence. The US exchange rate was up by half a yuan, making it seven yuan and three seventy-five. The unofficial market for British and American exchange rates fluctuated sharply, which was rare recently. Originally, rumors have been rampant recently, causing unease, and the trend initially eased and then tightened sharply, with extremely intense reactions. In the normal course of the day, the market opened with a long position in US and British exchange rates, leading to a tight British and flat US exchange rate. Subsequently, inheriting the residual power of the previous day's selling, coupled with the widespread peaceful atmosphere, caused many Chinese merchants with long positions to panic and close their positions. Moreover, Hong Kong telegrams also came to sell, while foreign firms had very little intention to buy. For a time, positions were overflowing. In less than half an hour, British gold broke the five-pence mark, reaching five pence point zero three one two five. The US exchange rate also called over eight yuan point three one two five. Unexpectedly, rumors suddenly emerged that the Ministry of Finance was about to issue gold treasury bills. HSBC suddenly came in to take advantage of the low prices, profiting and closing positions, while Chinese banks also began to buy on behalf of certain major clients. Foreign firms and some Chinese merchants also followed suit. However, the intention to sell was extremely weak, so those who followed the trend were too numerous to count, and the rebound was very strong, and the market was extremely chaotic. Until the close of trading, British gold was only four pence point seven eight one two five, and the US exchange rate was only seven yuan point eight one two five. As a result, compared with the previous day, British gold was tighter by one point eight seven five, and the US was softer by two point eight one two five. The underlying potential of futures remained the same as the spot market.</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants Actively Involved in Futures</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, London's broad bars saw a rise of two five in the near term and a rise of one eight seven five in the far term. The price of raw silk remained flat, and the price of London gold was stable. Exchange rates were flat between the UK, US, and France, and up by two five against Shanghai. The US was up by eight seven five against the UK, up by three and a half jiao against Shanghai, and up by six two five against France. The central government's official rates for various exchange rates remained the same. The bank's opening price for spot sales in the morning was four pence point nine three seven five for British gold and eight yuan point zero nine three seven five for the US exchange rate, which was up by zero point zero three one two five for British gold and unchanged for the US exchange rate compared with the previous closing, due to the rebound in exchange rates. After the opening, Hong Kong telegrams first came to sell three, and speculators also came to close their long positions, so the market continued to be strong. Until 9:25 AM, British gold broke the five-pence mark, reaching five pence point zero three one two five, and the US exchange rate also rose to eight yuan point three one two five. The HSBC official rates revealed an increase of two five for British gold and half a yuan for the US exchange rate. The official tax rate for white silver was announced to be up by one point two five. After that, the market suddenly changed, because HSBC successively absorbed existing sterling at five pence and existing US dollars at eight yuan point two five, which led foreign firms to rush to buy. In addition, foreign firms took profits, and Chinese banks such as Guohua Continental also actively participated in the spot futures market. In addition, speculators had stopped selling, and although foreign firms such as Datong had intentions to supply, they all took the opportunity to raise prices, so the rebound was quite strong. Until 10:20 AM, British gold had returned to the five-pence mark, falling to four pence point nine zero six two five, and the US exchange rate had also shrunk to the eight-yuan mark. Subsequently, some Chinese merchants came to buy in, causing the situation to continue to tighten until the close of trading, without any return.

<h3>Both Favorable and Unfavorable Arguments - Gold Prices Fall and Then Rebound Sharply - The Four Thousand Yuan Mark Almost Broken - Rumors of Gold Certificates Spark a Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial cash and red market conditions, with the environment suddenly improving again, although the initial opening was still weak, suddenly turned extremely tight due to the exchange market. The long position exaggerated and fabricated the atmosphere, causing speculators to hesitate, while those who intended to buy began to drag, and the chips felt exhausted. Therefore, the result was a sharp rise of fifty-nine yuan. In the early morning, due to the continued easing of the exchange market and the difficulty in dissipating the peaceful atmosphere, people's hearts were sluggish and uninspired. Retail investors all had intentions to sell, rushing to sell short, causing the opening price to plummet by forty-three yuan to four thousand and ten yuan. Continued to fall by another twenty yuan, falling to a low of four thousand yuan. At this time, the exchange market rapidly tightened, and the rumor that the Ministry of Finance was about to issue gold treasury bills resurfaced in the market, causing buyers to perk up. Securities firms, a certain bank, and two major currency exchange firms successively bought on behalf of Hong Kong, etc., while the short positions became more urgent. Although a certain gold firm was still selling, they were ultimately outnumbered, and the price soared. The high price of four thousand one hundred and twenty-five yuan appeared before the midday close. The closing price was four thousand one hundred and twenty-two yuan. There was no market in the afternoon, but the unofficial market was still firm at first, rising a few more yuan to four thousand one hundred and thirty yuan. Later, a certain firm came to sell, and bullion shops also had intentions to supply, so it fell back. It was heard that the final price had fallen to around four thousand one hundred and ten yuan. The volume of transactions in the morning was about two thousand taels. The price of gold jewelry rose by five yuan, and the price of customs duty remained flat.</p>
<p>Red Gold Rebounds by Fifty-Nine Yuan</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the morning, the price per tael (ten taels) has been scattered and weak. Because the foreign exchange rate continues to be strong, some floating investors sell short quite aggressively, and those who enter wait and see. The opening price is immediately slammed down by forty-three yuan. The money exchange firm sells twenty taels in full, for four thousand and twenty yuan. After a short time, under the selling pressure, it fell by another twenty yuan, and the money exchange firm did twenty taels, for four thousand yuan. Unexpectedly, at this time, the exchange market suddenly tightened, and the buying interest suddenly intensified, and the price immediately jumped up horizontally. In an instant, it had risen by fifty-five yuan. The gold firm entered thirty taels for the securities firm, for four thousand and fifty-five yuan. At that time, the securities firm sold more than one hundred taels, and the bullion firm also sold three, so it was once again pressed down to a small amount of four thousand and thirty yuan. After that, a certain firm in the securities firm vigorously entered, and at the same time, the money exchange firm also came to buy, and it was pulled back to four thousand and fifty-five yuan. Afterwards, a certain gold firm fiercely sold more than two hundred taels, and the rising trend was suppressed again for a while, and it fell again to four thousand and thirty-five yuan. Because the foreign exchange tightened greatly, the buying atmosphere was pervasive. A certain money exchange firm vigorously searched and bought on behalf of customers, and at the same time, securities firms also released disks and searched for purchases. In addition, floating positions were compensated, and it soon jumped sixty-seven yuan out of the four thousand one hundred yuan mark, and the securities firm entered ten taels for the money exchange firm, for four thousand one hundred and two yuan. At that time, the gold firm sold again, and the money exchange firm also slightly rebounded, and it retreated again to four thousand and eighty yuan. Afterwards, because the foreign exchange market continued to tighten, the buying interest was agitated again. A certain money exchange firm again bought on behalf of Hong Kong, and at the same time, the securities firm also released disks to search for purchases, and short positions were compensated, and it rose again by forty-five yuan, and the money exchange firm entered twenty taels for the securities firm, for four thousand one hundred and twenty-five yuan. Later, the money exchange firm released ten taels to the gold firm, for four thousand one hundred and twenty-two yuan, the closing price in the afternoon, and the result was that it rebounded by fifty-nine yuan compared to the previous day. The spot gold selling price of the local brand of the cash gold number was a few yuan higher than the cash gold, and the buying price was reduced by 20 yuan. The spot gold was more than fifty yuan lower than the official gold, and there was little business.</p>
<p>Gold Jewelry Also Hung Up by Five Yuan</p>
<p>At the beginning, the hanging price of gold jewelry per tael in bullion shops was still four hundred and ten yuan for Datong Bank, and it was changed by five yuan until 11 o'clock. Since then, there has been no change. As a result, Datong Bank changed to hanging four hundred and fifteen yuan, and the new colleague was the same as the above price. The purchasing price was reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Fluctuations Abound</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign currency experienced dramatic fluctuations. Initially, ample supply led to a loose and flooded market. Subsequently, rumors of gold coin and note issuance spread, causing a sudden surge in demand and a stronger market. British and American gold pounds rebounded strongly. The US dollar note once fell to $12.20 in the morning, and the British silver note fell to $45. However, it quickly reversed and rose significantly. The evening market saw the US dollar note rise to $12.83, and the British gold note rise to $45.80. Hong Kong dollar and French franc notes also initially weakened before strengthening, ultimately rising significantly. Demand for Canadian and Philippine notes was strong, leading to high market prices. The Japanese gold note market was weak, with the evening market at $1.365. The Korean currency continued to weaken, with the evening market at $1.09. Yesterday's market prices saw the British and American gold pounds rise by $1.50 each, the British gold note rise by $0.80, the US dollar note rise by $0.46, the Hong Kong dollar rise by $0.04, the French franc rise by $0.005, the Canadian dollar rise by $0.20, and the Philippine dollar rise by $0.10. Other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic and Foreign Bonds Continue to Soar</h3>
<p>The gray market for securities remained quite good yesterday. Class C stock astonishingly broke through the $50 mark, and Class B stock broke through the $2 mark, showing a very favorable trend. However, after several days of rising, many held floating profits and sought to cash in, causing slight market fluctuations. The atmosphere of peace remained strong, seemingly driven by certain parties' desires, as evidenced by slogans in the occupied territories and the statements of the manager of the Yokohama Specie Bank's London branch. Furthermore, there were rumors of a return of the Song family to power, suggesting that peace was not far off. Despite market fluctuations, the market sentiment and environmental conditions indicated a predominantly upward trend, as most buyers belonged to the financial sector. In the morning session, No. 16 and Da Feng were the most active buyers. Hong Da Heng Fu and Lian Yi also saw strong buying interest. Run Li Lian He and Jiu Feng saw many bulls cashing out. Tong Shun bought Class A and sold domestic bonds. Other small investors also cashed out. Class C stock reached $50.03, and Class B stock reached $52.50. Later, due to profit-taking, prices slightly retreated. In the afternoon, No. 38 and Da Feng continued to buy in large quantities. Lian Yi Ju Xin and Heng Fu also saw buying interest, but many holders of floating profits rushed to sell due to the sudden rise in gold prices. Class C stock re-entered the $50 range, ultimately ending slightly higher by $0.15 to $0.25. Total transaction volume exceeded $1.1 million. A summary table is provided below.</p>
<p>Stock transactions: 30 shares of Guohua Bank stock were traded at a price of $50.</p>
<p>London, May 5th: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign bonds remained stable, with no changes in any of the French bonds.</p>
<p>London, May 5th: Today's listed prices for British Far Eastern companies' stocks saw continued gains in bank stocks. Mercantile Bank rose 1 shilling 3 pence to £8 15s. Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation shares continued to rise by £1, with shares registered in London at £84.50 and shares registered in Hong Kong at £86.50. The rest remained stable.</p>
<p>Yesterday's stock market at the public exchange was extremely lively and exciting. Public attention remained focused on rubber stocks, while various industrial stocks also reached new highs. Trading was most active in the morning, with prices rising steadily. However, as those who profited rushed to cash out, the rise in low-priced rubber stocks was dampened. The closing market was extremely firm. Closing prices are listed below.</p>
<h3>Grains: Rice Sales Stagnant</h3>
<p>Price per "hu" (unit of volume) Continues to Drop by 2-3 Cents</p>
<p>After briefly tightening the day before yesterday, early morning trading of japonica rice continued to show a positive outlook. However, reports that sources of supply from the interior, such as early and late rice from Nan'gang, were difficult to transport, and that only a few shipments arrived in Hongkou for redistribution, led guest diners to view the various goods in hand as an opportunity to profit, unwilling to easily sell. Buyers, believing in the yesterday's line of prosperity, continued to show interest in purchasing, making many inquiries. As a result, sellers lacked the ability to bargain up prices, and initially saw a slight increase. However, the market suddenly saw the release of no less than 1,000-2,000 bags of early and late rice from Hongkou being sold in the market, and large quantities of foreign rice also followed suit, flooding the market with both spot and futures goods. Although sales were good, there was ultimately a lack of capacity to absorb it all, and the market saw an imbalance between supply and demand. Buyers inevitably became discouraged and returned to observing. Sales quickly became sluggish, and sellers, seeking to sell, had no choice but to cut prices. Therefore, a decline quickly set in, with both japonica rice, domestic rice, and various foreign rice varieties falling by 2-3 cents. Ultimately, it was felt that it was difficult to reverse the market sentiment, with little success. As a result, early and late rice, which had been quoted at $37 in the morning, closed at only $36.45. Saigon rice initially traded at $36.50, but later only $36.12.</p>
<p>Foreign rice: Inventories are full and supplies continue to arrive. Recently, in addition to direct shipments from Saigon to Shanghai, shipments from Hong Kong have also frequently arrived in small quantities. The low-priced Saigon rice and broken rice will also all arrive in Shanghai and are scheduled to be sold soon. Furthermore, the pricing of regular rice and broken rice can still be unified. Therefore, merchants and customers lack the capacity to absorb them. Yesterday, less than 3,000 bags were traded. Grade 1 Saigon rice has returned to $36.35, regular rice to $35, and high-quality broken rice to $31.80. Lower quality broken rice has retreated slightly to $29.20, which is a small decrease of 3-5 cents compared to the previous market.</p>
<h3>Flour Steady, Wheat Still Popular</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the flour market continued to be stable. Sales to local customers were sluggish due to the weekend. Furthermore, goods previously ordered from Tianjin and Hong Kong are still being reported for import. Demand for New Year's goods on this street is still early. Flour factories, while having ordered foreign wheat, are unwilling to process and produce due to still-high costs, and are only willing to sell as they produce. Therefore, total transaction volume was less than 30,000 bags. The Grade 1 flour factory continued to quote $9, the price of returned goods from the Warship brand was $9.35, and the price of Lu Pao Che (brand name) flour to customers still required $9.50. The market was particularly stable. Transactions of Japanese factory flour were not active. The January Phoenix brand was quoted at $9.034, and ultimately fluctuated around $9.10. Today, 10,950 bags of flour were shipped to Xiamen, and 3,000 bags were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Wheat: The wheat market remained strong. Domestic wheat prices are currently high, and supply has been lacking for a long time. Although factories have ordered foreign wheat, concerns remain that supply will take considerable time and that prices will ultimately be higher than domestic wheat. Therefore, holders of goods continue to insist and are unwilling to easily sell, leading to a favorable outlook. Suzhou white wheat was priced at $15.55, Wuxi and Changzhou wheat at $15.50, and Pudong wheat at $15.40. Fuxin factory purchased 1,000 bags and Fufeng purchased 2,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Many Forced to Cut Losses, Yarn Prices Plummet</h3>
<p>Shuang Ma (Double Horse) Reaches a Low of $721</p>
<p>The yarn market continued to decline, and the decline was particularly severe. This was due to falling cotton prices overseas, the great victory in northern Guangdong, and the increasingly severe easing of foreign exchange. Many holders of floating profits panicked and rushed to sell and close out positions in the market. At the same time, real demand remained sluggish and lacked vitality, and buyers were also lacking. For the January and February Shuang Ma yarn, a de facto speculative instrument, selling pressure was high and the market became increasingly unsustainable. 20-count Shuang Ma once plummeted to $721. Soon after, around 11:30 AM, news of a tightening in foreign exchange caused a slight dissipation of the atmosphere of panic. However, actual business was too sluggish.</p>
<p>Spot yarn opened in the morning due to overseas factors favoring shortages, coupled with news that the exchange market was expected to ease further, making the market listless. 20-count Shuang Ma opened at $730, down $10. Continuing news of increasingly easy exchange rates led to further declines, once reaching $721. Trading of January and February futures was extremely lively. By closing, prices had rebounded again due to the tightening of foreign exchange. 20-count Xie Ma closed at $728. Total transaction volume for half a day was 1,600 bales. Prices for 20-count Shuang Ma fell by $13, Shuang Di Qiu (Double Globe) fell by $15, and Tian Nu (Heavenly Woman) fell by $15. Today, 205 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, 30 bales were shipped to Haikou, 100 bales were shipped to Haiphong, and 115 bales were shipped to Xiamen. A breakdown of the amount purchased by each guild is listed below.</p>
<h3>Japanese Factories Actively Buy, Cotton Sales Improve</h3>
<p>Transactions of domestic cotton have become more active, with sales between companies being particularly improved. Demand from Qingdao is strong, while business in Shanghai is secondary. Of yesterday's transactions, Fuchengxin purchased about 50% of the goods, which were mostly used for transportation to the north. Shanghai-based Japanese factories also made purchases at the opening, so the cotton market remained stable. However, American cotton saw a decline, while instant cotton remained on a tight and expensive path. Supplies from northern Jiangsu included 5,870 bales of Tonghua, 1,677 bales from Changyinsha, and 1,750 bales from Beisha. The situation of spot cotton opening transactions is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Another report on foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was very strong in the early morning due to overseas buyers in the market, leading to rising prices. Later, due to hedging by southern companies and profit-taking by bulls, the market turned weak, resulting in a closing price that was 10 points lower than the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by 4 rupees. Egyptian cotton rose by 60 pounds. Liverpool cotton rose by 20 pence.</p>
<p>Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transactions: All parties are wary of making purchases due to the excessive fluctuations in exchange rates and the proliferation of various rumors. Factories are also unwilling to make advances due to the sharp fall in yarn prices. Therefore, trading throughout the day was unusually quiet. Yesterday's cotton market prices, converted to factory delivery prices using an exchange rate of $8 to the US dollar, are as follows:</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Soybean Oil Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean oil market saw prices fall across the board due to the impending arrival of crude oil shipments from Dalian. 120 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were opened at a price of $74 to $74.50. 300 pieces of Qingqi oil were priced at $77. 300 pieces of Yanqi oil were priced at $78. 70 barrels of Qingdao oil were priced at $100. 50 barrels of Jiangbei oil were priced at $100, and 200 cans of canned oil were priced at $98. 30 barrels of Changzhou oil from the factory were priced at $101, and 20 barrels of Bengbu oil were priced at $100. Although market prices have now fallen back, it is hoped that powerful forces will not release their demonic hands and become the indirect culprits of murder again.</p>
<p>Today, 5,914 cans of crude oil and 250 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, and 150 pieces were shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Chaoqing and Diaoqing Varieties From Production Areas Have Entered the Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended flat, with little fluctuation. The guild's price list for spot goods showed Grade 2 and 4 coarse white sugar at $58.50 at the main warehouse, $59 for newly arrived goods at outside warehouses, $59 for old goods, and $48 for re-exports. Taikoo brand white B mark was $59 at the east warehouse and $59.30 at the west warehouse. CW mark was $59, CX mark was $58.70, DY mark was $58.50, and HX mark was $58. Prices for cart red and Dutch red remained unchanged. Grade 1 of the Ben Mian brand white sugar was $58.50, Grade 2 was $58, Grade 1 crystal sugar was $68.50, and Jingming crystal sugar was $70. According to information from cargo owners, the production area of domestic Diaoqing sugar has seen new crops, but as shipments are not active and prices remain high, there are few shipments to Shanghai. Only half of the harvest has been collected, and it is feared that it may not be suitable. This is because cargo arriving by Japanese ships is priced more favorably, with a slight decrease of $2. Yesterday, the Jian gang opened over 200 bags at $44, and 120 bags of ordinary Han red at $39. According to news from Shantou, this year's harvest of new Chaoqing is only 50%, and production prices remain too high to be suitable.</p>
<h3>Textiles: Cotton Cloth Rebounds in the Afternoon, Sales Stronger to the Nanyang Guild</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: Cotton cloth continued the weak trend from the previous day. The early market saw continued easing of foreign exchange, leading to a relaxed market sentiment and a surge in selling pressure. Prices in various cloth markets retreated by about $0.05 per bolt, and buyers' interest was weak, resulting in a sharp decline in transaction volume. However, the exchange market suddenly contracted in the afternoon, and all cloths rebounded in unison, approaching the original prices. As a result, prices fell slightly by $0.10 to $0.25 per bolt.</p>
<p>The Nanyang Guild traded over 5,000 bolts of bleached cloth, colored cloth, and printed cloth. The Sichuan-Yunnan Guild traded over 6,000 bolts of colored cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, and colored satin. The Guangdong-Fujian Guild traded over 100 boxes of colored twill. The local street traded over 300 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, and group cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: In the morning market, due to the continued rise in foreign exchange, market sentiment turned weak. Prices for white and colored goods declined. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth opened at a low price of $21.35. Jiao Junzi Serge fell to $0.06575 per yard. By the afternoon session, the rise in yarn prices caused a strong reaction. In the late market, Longtou fine cloth rose to $22 per bolt, and Four Gentlemen Serge rose to $0.068, while Straight Tribute rose to $0.071. The market situation tightened suddenly and showed signs of continued gains. All colleagues on the Japanese street sought to purchase over 700 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill.</p>
<p>Exports: Today, 225 pieces of textiles were shipped to Xiamen, 37 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, 36 pieces were shipped to Singapore, 40 pieces were shipped to Guangzhou Bay, 21 pieces were shipped to Haimen, and 501 pieces were shipped to Haiphong.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Persimmon Cakes Fall</h3>
<p>Recent shipments of persimmon cakes have been strong, reaching a total of over 500 pieces. Boxed Zhuang Pai cakes are priced at $28, and Qing cakes are priced at $25 to $26, a decrease of $2-3 compared to before, not yet open for sale.</p>
<h3>Coal: Wenzhou Charcoal Arrives - Over 10,000-20,000 Baskets -</h3>
<p>The city's charcoal supply relies entirely on the Yangtze River and eastern Zhejiang. Since the Sino-Japanese War, the Yangtze River source has been completely cut off, relying only on shipments from eastern Zhejiang. Transportation has been obstructed, preventing smooth flow, so prices have gradually risen. Although shipments have arrived in steady streams recently, prices have not decreased. The Norwegian ship Xin An Mao, represented by Xie Ji Company, arrived from Wenzhou with over 20,000 baskets of charcoal last night and unloaded at the Observatory Wharf in the French Concession.</p>

<h3>French Boy Scouts in the European War</h3>
<p>— Tian Shi</p>
<p>The heroic defense of the Sihang Warehouse by the 88th Division often reminds us of Ms. Yang Huimin's courageous delivery of the splendid national emblem into the encirclement. The glorious historical facts published by the China Boy Scout General Association in Qingmuguan, Jianchuan, shining in succession with Ms. Yang, could perhaps form a great volume. How heroic are the Boy Scouts! Possessing all the essentials of virtue, agility, health, and beauty, and continuously developing without limit.</p>
<p>The founder of the Boy Scouts, British Lord Robert Baden-Powell, said, "You seek peace, but if a country is unfortunately faced with foreign aggression, you are all prepared, always serving the country."</p>
<p>Today, people in the West fully understand that the training and education of Boy Scouts can make them great leaders. Leadership talent requires not only knowledge and learning, but also the tempering of temperament and the forging of character, as well as the ability to act automatically to fulfill their responsibilities. This means that in addition to academic ability, they must also have mental strength and possess the virtue of "being able to obey." If a person can combine the above two strengths and be prepared for everything as Lord Baden-Powell said, they can easily fulfill the ancient Chinese saying, "Preparedness averts peril."</p>
<p>Here, I present the merits of the French Boy Scouts serving their country since the outbreak of the European War, to compare with our own country.</p>
<p>1. Completing the harvest in the fields: As France mobilized, strong men went to the front lines, and farms lacked labor at harvest time. The French Ministry of Agriculture summoned the Boy Scouts to help with the reaping. This is roughly similar to the cooperative autumn harvest of soldiers and civilians from Miluo River to Hengyang in Hunan Province. Our Chinese villagers see soldiers as friends, while French farmers call the Boy Scouts who do everything "smiling soldiers."</p>
<p>2. Digging air-raid shelters in preparation for unexpected emergencies.</p>
<p>3. Riding motorcycles to deliver important letters, which is fast and accurate.</p>
<p>4. Dispersing into the rear, border areas, or along the coast to conduct keen reconnaissance, paying particular attention to the traces of enemy air raids, and practicing various methods of not getting lost in the dark at night.</p>
<p>5. Moving injured people and providing first aid, as well as food and comfort.</p>
<p>6. Evacuating children and the sick.</p>
<p>7. Evacuating the population of large cities.</p>
<p>8. Providing guidance and care at train stations or street corners. In all fairness, their most remarkable achievement was taking care of passengers and regulating traffic at the beginning of the war, thereby accelerating the evacuation from large cities to the interior. A traveler from a neutral country wrote of their experience in Paris:</p>
<p>Three days before dawn, the train entered the dimly lit Gare du Nord in Paris. There were no cars to be seen, nor could one find a porter to carry luggage. Just as one was at a loss, a few Boy Scouts emerged from the darkness, immediately acquiring a car from somewhere unknown. The hopelessly heavy suitcases were all loaded onto the car in an instant. The grateful passengers were about to express their thanks, but the many Boy Scouts had already disappeared. It is also said that an old woman arrived at the station, suffering from a disability that made it difficult for her to walk. In the commotion of the crowd, she suddenly lost her luggage, and the young child she was carrying was also separated midway. But this lonely old woman was not afraid, saying, "With the Boy Scouts here, there is nothing to worry about." Before long, the luggage and the child were indeed helped by the Boy Scouts and nothing was lost. This shows the deep faith that the general public has in the Boy Scouts. Moreover, the work of the Boy Scouts is generally calm and without mistakes, and they greet people with a lively "joy," which is enough to ease the tense atmosphere in times of crisis, and because of the "happy" thoughts of most people, strengthen the ability and spirit to encourage self-improvement.</p>
<h3>Don't Be Shy</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Shyness is perhaps a natural trait. Young children are generally shy. When meeting slightly unfamiliar elders, relatives, and friends, they often hide away, unwilling to call out a greeting quickly and frankly, or say a word. Only after being forced and instructed by their parents will they reluctantly obey, but with a red face and ears, they quickly run away. This is not because children are impolite, but because they are naturally shy.</p>
<p>Since shyness is a natural trait, it is naturally not to be criticized. However, children cannot develop shyness into a habit, so that they are shy everywhere and timid everywhere. That would create a great obstacle for themselves. For example, in academics, it would have a great impact. Originally, there were doubts in the textbooks, and one was prepared to stand up and ask the teacher, but because of shyness, one dared not raise the doubtful question in front of everyone, for fear of being laughed at. Therefore, one passed over it vaguely, and even as an adult, one still does not understand those doubts, or even regrets it for life. This is a very clear example of suffering from shyness.</p>
<p>Another example is being called to the blackboard by the teacher to solve a problem. Originally, the problem was not difficult, and one could solve it quickly and accurately to get an "A." But because of shyness, when facing the blackboard, one becomes distracted and hesitant. With the chalk in hand, one trembles and dares not write. If the teacher urges them again, they will inevitably make many mistakes. When they are considered careless and stupid, even if they cry out in injustice, how will others understand them? This is also being harmed by shyness.</p>
<p>Although shyness is not considered a bad habit, it can suppress the talents and abilities of children, turn cleverness into stupidity, bury one's will, and become a subordinate. Children may have had such experiences: when the teacher asks you to draw a free drawing, if no one is standing next to you, you will definitely boldly paint a landscape picture or an aerial combat picture. But if the teacher is standing next to you, you become so restrained that you can't even draw a small flying bird. Your courage suddenly becomes narrow, and your talent suddenly cannot be expressed. Isn't that the greatest loss!</p>
<p>Therefore, children must release their courage and break the psychological effects of shyness. Even in a large crowd, say what you want to say, do what you want to do!</p>

<h3>Winter Use Summer Heat</h3>
<p>— Su Ming</p>
<p>When the clock struck four, Yonger finally came home from school. The northwest wind on the road was quite terrible on his face, causing him to shrink his head into his coat collar, not daring to stretch it out fully. With great difficulty, he arrived home, his ears already frozen red. Once inside the house, his ears seemed to be burning with heat. As he put down his book, he grumbled, "This cold weather is really unbearable. It's better in the hot weather."</p>
<p>"However, the heat of summer is not easy to bear either," his brother, Zonger, retorted.</p>
<p>"That's right. In winter, we say summer is good, and in hot weather, we think cold weather is good. But why is the climate so uneven? It's so cold that people freeze to death, and so hot that people get dizzy. If we could store the heat of summer and use it in winter, wouldn't that be good?"</p>
<p>"That's right! In summer, our roofs are scorched by the fire-like sun, but at night, that heat is wasted. It's a real pity. If we could store it, it wouldn't be so cold in winter," Zonger said loudly with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"Then how do we store the heat?" This question aroused Yonger's interest.</p>
<p>"According to some designs, a water pipe is installed on the roof, and the water is heated by the sun. Then the water is introduced from the pipe into the soil deep underground. Because in this deep stratum, the temperature changes of the air on the surface will not affect the temperature of the water underground, so this heated water can be stored underground. In cold weather, the warm water is sent into a large-tube evaporator. The air pressure is artificially reduced, causing the alcohol to evaporate. (You need to know that when a liquid turns into a gas, it must absorb heat. Conversely, it releases the heat it absorbed. If you boil water, you must add heat for the water to turn into steam.) The alcohol absorbs part of the heat from the water, turning into alcohol vapor. It is released into another device where the pressure is high, and the alcohol vapor condenses back into liquid, releasing the heat it just absorbed, warming the nearby cold water. Then, the hot water is transferred to the steam pipe and passed into each room, driving out all the cold air. This method is very simple, but it is not that easy in reality. Naturally, it also consumes some electricity or fuel to maintain the circulation of the water, but the cost is half of the cost of burning coal. However, the water pipe leading underground needs to be almost a hundred feet deep to be effective, which is a bit difficult."</p>

<h3>Little Maxims</h3>
<p>— Xin Fang</p>
<p>If you cry to someone, they say you have a bad temper. If you smile to someone, they say you have a good temper. Children, children, must remember, less crying, more smiling, healthy body.</p>
<p>The longer you hold sugar in your mouth, the longer the sweetness lasts. Reading is the same: the longer you read, the longer the taste of the book stays with you.</p>
<p>A child who truly reads with their heart will never be willing to soil the books at hand.</p>
<p>Older brother is older than me, so let older brother sit first. Younger brother is younger than me, so let younger brother eat first. In this way, I will be a good younger brother and a good older brother. (Recorded from Children's Magazine)</p>
<h3>My Childhood</h3>
<p>— Yang Jinhao</p>
<p>Which child doesn't love to play? In childhood, one should also play games to enliven the spirit and strengthen the body. If one buries oneself in books all day long, desperately studying hard until the body becomes weak and the mind dull, wouldn't that be turning into an old man?</p>
<p>However, excessive playing can hinder proper activities. Wasting time like that is also inappropriate.</p>
<p>In my childhood, I loved playing too much and didn't study well enough. Looking back now, I really regret it a bit.</p>
<p>At that time, I was always gathering a few friends, fighting on empty fields, doing somersaults at graves, picking up bamboo poles to play with spears and sticks. Naturally, I often kicked shuttlecocks, bounced leather balls, and rolled iron hoops. When the coldest days came, we threw snowballs, built snowmen, and knocked on ice gongs. Sometimes we even took off our clothes and bared our chests to show that I was a hero. However, these games did train my body well. Therefore, even though I suffered several major illnesses when I grew up, I was able to overcome them.</p>
<p>I first attended a private school opened by a cousin, reading things like the "Three Character Classic," "Mencius," "Analects"... without understanding any of it. Later, my father took time out at home to lecture and teach some poor neighborhood children, but I still couldn't get into those old relics. My father was naturally lazy and didn't enjoy teaching for long, so he sent me to a small elementary school at the end of East Street. However, I felt depressed when I entered the school and often played truant.</p>
<p>At this time, I met some new friends who were studying at an elementary school in Henan. They said that studying there was very interesting and persuaded me to go there as well. I don't know if my understanding had finally opened up, but I suddenly made up my mind to study hard. I felt that I wasn't young anymore, and it was embarrassing to not have read much.</p>
<p>When school started, I joined the elementary school in Henan. After that, I never missed a class. Even if there were things to do at home, I would still go to school.</p>
<p>However, after class, we still played games. Often at night, we gathered many children, some carrying lanterns, some holding bamboo poles, lined up in a row, singing the national anthem, and circled a large area in the east and west ends of the city and in the north and south suburbs. The marching commands of "One! Two! Three! Four!" also echoed loudly. We were like patrolling at night, protecting our hometown, and guarding against sneak attacks by powerful enemies and thieves. Everyone's spirits were very uplifted and excited, which cultivated a sense of collective spirit among us children.</p>
<p>When I was young, I also liked to go to the countryside to sketch, plant flowers and plants in the garden, tie flower pots, build flower beds, and make sugar cakes. I also often stood alone on a water bridge to fish, or followed the maid to the fields to pick wild vegetables. These things, on one hand, were games for me, and on the other hand, were also labor. I really felt happy doing them. Now, I often treat labor as a game, so I don't feel bored doing it.</p>
<p>A year later, I went to another city to attend high school. I still spent a lot of time playing then. It wasn't until I entered middle school that I desperately read extracurricular books. Now, the fact that I can write articles is thanks to many extracurricular books.</p>

<p>Special Report from This Newspaper</p>
<h3>Ying Yin Returns</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Wu Xingzai Sends Telegram from Kunming Requesting Her to Star as Empress Dowager Cixi for Cooperative Production</p>
<p>In the New Year, I was eager to find some exciting news to share with readers. Luckily, I came across a great scoop yesterday and am reporting it to everyone now: Ying Yin has returned to Shanghai. I recall receiving a letter from a friend in Chongqing at the end of last year stating that Ying Yin was rumored to have disappeared. The original letter was vague, and Hong Kong newspapers also had some coverage on Ying Yin, but the reasons for her disappearance were all speculative and lacked concrete details. Who would have thought that Ying Yin, whose disappearance was widely reported in Chongqing, would actually appear on Avenue Joffre in the "Isolated Island" last night?</p>
<p>Since the disbandment of "Qingniao," Ying Yin went to the inland areas and eventually arrived in Chongqing, where she has been for almost two years. Her acting is known for being bold and lively. Her role as "Wu Zetian" in "Yeshi" was her claim to fame. In Chongqing, the wartime capital of the new China, talent like hers was needed in both film and theater, so her sudden disappearance quickly spread to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Now that I have unexpectedly encountered her, I naturally had to ask about the reason for her coming to Shanghai. In a hurried moment, she briefly told me:</p>
<p>After "Confucius," Minghua Company will be co-producing "Empress Dowager Cixi" with Hezhong. After countless auditions, they finally found a suitable actor, Tang Huaiqiu, who suddenly returned to play Confucius. So, for the role of Empress Dowager Cixi, they sought the opinions of colleagues from both companies in advance, hoping to decide soon to avoid a last-minute scramble. Wu Xingzai happened to be in Kunming, so they asked him to send a telegram to Chongqing to discuss the matter with Ying Yin. Because of the invitations from Fei Mu and others, Ying Yin agreed to come from afar to star in this "Empress Dowager Cixi." When Chongqing was rife with rumors of her disappearance, she was actually flying to Hong Kong. When Hong Kong newspapers were publishing various reports about her, she was waiting for Wu Xingzai to come from Kunming and return to Shanghai together.</p>
<p>She is temporarily staying at a friend's house, engaging in research to prepare for filming "Empress Dowager Cixi." Once "Confucius" is completed, "Empress Dowager Cixi" will begin filming.</p>
<h3>Ying Yin as Beautiful and Healthy as Ever</h3>
<p>— Zhao</p>
<h3>Battle of Changsha</h3>
<p>— Xingyan</p>
<p>"Battle of Changsha" is also known as Guan-Huang Face-Off. In the past, Wang Guifen and Tan Xinpei performed it in the inner court. Wang played Guan Yu, and Tan played Huang Zhong, with Li Lianzhong as Wei Yan. They were evenly matched and regarded as a masterpiece at the time. When Wang retired and Tan was in his later years, he always played the red-faced role himself and let Li's apprentice Rui Debao play Huang Zhong. This habit gave people the impression that the red-faced Guan Yu was the leading role and the older martial role was the supporting one, but this is not the case. Guan Yu and Huang Zhong are equally important in the play. If we take the execution ground scene, Huang's singing and acting are more complex, so Huang seems more important than Guan. In recent years, many bearded singers have come south, but there is no suitable candidate for the red-faced role (Lin Shusen rarely performs with Peking Opera actors), so this great play has disappeared from the stage, making fans long for it. This time, Xin Gengxin invited Tan-style bearded singer Guan Dayuan and Wang Hongshou (San Mazi)'s talented disciple Li Hongchun, and paired them with martial second female lead Liu Yanting, so "Battle of Changsha" could be performed again. I went to see it that day. Dayuan has a deep understanding of Tan's style, and his voice is especially suitable for high pitches, so the singing part can be said to be flawless. In particular, several inverted boards and the final Hui Long tune were even more brilliant. As for the style of wearing armor, his slightly shorter stature does not detract from its beauty. This is because he has been deeply involved since childhood. It is said that he was able to perform on stage at the age of twelve, so he is much better than the average Tan-style actor who started halfway. The most difficult part of the play is when Huang Zhong loses his horse (when Guan Gong uses the Dragging Saber trick), he must roll over and fall off his horse at the front of the stage with a "wave drum" (when rolling, his body is straight, like shaking a wave drum). This kind of skill cannot be easily attempted without years of practice, especially when holding a large knife and wearing a flag on his back. If he is not familiar with this, the knife will fly and the flag will break. Unexpectedly, Dayuan's roll was extremely stable, clean and beautiful. When he knelt up, his knife was lying across his face, as if placed there by an inspector. This one move alone is enough to overwhelm his peers. In recent years, there are not many actors who can perform plays with armor, let alone rolling a wave drum with a knife while wearing armor. Hongchun is limited by the large assignment, and his pitch differs from Dayuan by almost one and a half notes, but he worked very hard that day, and his poses were also very experienced. Yanting is good at playing supporting roles. Wei Yan, Zhang Fei, Meng Liang, and Niu Gao, etc., can best show his strengths, so he also won praise in the play that day. Dayuan is in his prime, and I hope he can perform more Tan plays with armor this time, so the audience's ears and eyes can be refreshed.</p>

<h3>Xin Yanqiu and Yu Zhenfei Expected to Arrive in Shanghai on the 10th</h3>
<p>— Mr. Shutai</p>
<p>Xin Yanqiu, Yu Zhenfei, Guan Shengji, etc., departed from Pingfu Tangzhan on the Shuntian Wheel on the 5th of this month and are heading south. They are expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 10th and will perform in the renewal. Xin Ling is a direct disciple of Cheng Yushuang and has a deep understanding. She and Xue Yanqin can be called the brightest stars of their time. She has many plays, and all of Cheng's famous plays, such as "The Three Heroes of the Dust," "The Jasper Hairpin," "The Mandarin Duck Tomb," and "Wenji Returns to Han," are Xin Ling's specialties. Xin Ling also has a private wooden play, "Yujing Taoist" and "King Xiang Meets Yuji," which is different from Mei's famous play "Farewell My Concubine," and this decision will also be revealed in the first performance. Yu Zhenfei's young male roles are proficient in both Kunqu and mixed styles, and he is full of talent. He is a rare choice in the current young male role scene. This decision will be made with Xin Ling, which will definitely help to reflect the splendor of the flowers and leaves.</p>
<h3>Ernst Lubitsch Talks About the Stars of 1940</h3>
<p>— Muyi</p>
<p>Ernst Lubitsch recently spoke at length with a reporter from Picture Play magazine, and his remarks about the new female stars of 1940 are very noteworthy. I have selected and translated them below.</p>
<p>The actresses needed on the screen in 1940 are not dummies. Stage experience is very important: the younger and more experienced the girl, the greater her chances of success.</p>
<p>Beauty is not the most important thing; only a few great stars are beautiful. But every famous actress has her own personality, attraction, and magic. The star of 1940 does not need to be very intelligent, but she cannot lack reason.</p>
<p>(Editor's note: Ernst Lubitsch's words are very insightful and can be used as a reference for filmmakers and film practitioners in our country. Especially the last two sentences, in the current environment in Shanghai, one can fully appreciate them.)</p>
<h3>Unofficial History of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Is Gui Junqing Still Alive?</p>
<p>I love watching Master Gui Er's court and military plays. I have watched his "Stealing the Imperial Records," "Assembly of Heroes," "Wang Zuo Cuts His Arm," etc., many times. They are truly worth watching over and over again. His "Selling the Horse and Requiring the Mace" is also worthy of being one of the best after Lao Tan. The style of the mace is different from that of Shuyan. Sun Zuochen once talked to me about it in Japan. He said that Lao Tan regarded the mace as a unique skill and never passed it on to others because he was a martial artist and he was a bad person. I am afraid that others would steal it, so he often changed the tricks of his mace every time. Lao Yuan had been with him for a long time, and he also liked martial arts (he had the nickname of Sun Lao with the spear), so he had a good understanding of Lao Tan's mace. He had also practiced a few times in my residence. Although Gui Er had not obtained the direct inheritance from Tan, when Lao Yuan accompanied him to play the Qin, he had also told Gui Er about the moves of Lao Tan's whirlwind. Naturally, it was not far from Lao Tan. Later, Xiao Yu's mace was probably what Lao Tan called "reducing the head and removing the tail" in his later years. Furthermore, You Chen, Jupeng, etc., were all self-taught and had not put in as much effort as Junqing, so they could only sing "Selling the Horse" but not the "Requiring" mace below. In short, the Tan-style plays that Gui Er knew were indeed very solid. As mentioned above, those few plays were not inferior to Shuyan. Perhaps there were even places where they were better than Xiao Yu's. Now I hear that he is still living in the Yantai and Harbin areas, and is very down on his luck. There are many wealthy amateur performers at sea. If they can find out about Gui Er's whereabouts and bring him to the south, they can really get a good Tan-style play. (170)</p>

<h3>Guilin City, Established on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>— Gong Huai</p>
<p>Its Strategic Location Has Made It a Southwest National Defense Stronghold; Its Beautiful Scenery Still Retains a Spirited Life</p>
<p>Guilin is Guangxi's hub after the War of Resistance and the center of southwest culture and politics. Since Nanning fell, it has become an important military town. According to sources, the Guangxi Provincial Government has decided to change Guilin to a city on New Year's Day of the 29th year of the Republic of China and appoint Chen Enyuan as mayor. As for the original Guilin County, it has now been renamed Lingui County, and the county magistrate is still Tian Liangji. From then on, Guilin's position in national defense will become even more important.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the City</p>
<p>Guilin's city walls are surrounded by rugged and verdant mountains, forming a very majestic landscape. The city's perimeter is twelve li, with twelve gates, including Wusheng, Ningyuan, Anding, and Lizhe in the east. The most bustling street is called Gongyuan Street, where stores selling Suzhou and Hangzhou foreign goods are concentrated. The city is still quite prosperous. Since Guangzhou and Wuhan fell one after another and Changsha was burned down by a fire, party and government officials and civilians who retreated from Hunan, Hubei, and Guangdong provinces poured into Guilin like a tide, almost bursting the small city of Guilin. At that time, all the houses were rented out, and the usually quiet city gradually became active. Streamlined cars crawled all over the streets, and the torrent of people surged back and forth. The decoration of the shops also became gorgeous, and the colorful goods in the city also appeared in the city of Guilin. It is now like a modern city. But, unfortunately, the Japanese planes repeatedly flew over Guilin, carrying out cruel bombings. As a result, one-third of the houses were destroyed. Countless innocent civilians were bombed to death. After each bombing, the streets were filled with rubble, coke, bomb craters, and scattered telephone lines, and the scorched street trees were filled with a desolate atmosphere. But on these scorched earth, in just a few days, new simple houses made of wooden boards or reed mats were filled. The power of this construction is something that everyone should admire.</p>
<p>Beautiful Scenery</p>
<p>"Guilin's scenery is the best in the world," as everyone says. Because the mountains in Guilin are very tall and beautiful; the water in Guilin (referring to the Guijiang River) is clear and lovely, like "filtered through a water filter." The most famous of these is Duxiu Peak, which stands tall in the city, 50 zhang high, and is not connected to the mountains outside the city. There are more than 300 stone steps on the mountain leading to the top. From here, you can see the entire city. Yan Yanzhi of the Song Dynasty once wrote the poem "Not as good as Duxiu, towering in the city" to sing about it. Therefore, Duxiu's reputation has become even more famous. The most famous scenic spots outside the city are Elephant Trunk Hill and Seven Star Cave. Elephant Trunk Hill is in the south of the city. The shape of the mountain is like an elephant raising its nose. There is a tower on it, which looks like a bottle from a distance. Below is the Water Moon Cave, which is a perfect circle and communicates with the back of the mountain. The river water enters and exits the cave, and it is clear and visible, looking like a bright moon from a distance. Seven Star Cave is outside the East Gate, deep and wide, making it the crown of the caves in Guilin. The cave is behind Qixia Temple. There is a stone at the entrance of the cave that looks like a carp. There is a deep pool on the left, which is said to be connected to the beach. The ground on the right is wet and slippery. If you are not careful, there is a danger of falling into the pool. The locals call it Motianling. You must light a torch in the cave to move forward. Inside are oddly shaped rocks everywhere. Some are like lions playing with balls, some are like crouching elephants, some are like the Xiangshan Buddha with palms together, and some are like the Maitreya Buddha with his mouth open. It takes twenty minutes to get out of the cave. In addition, there are also Fubo Mountain, Longyin Cave, Yongji Bridge, etc., which are also very famous. Due to space limitations, I can only omit them.</p>

<h3>A Study of the Zhuang People of Guangdong and Guangxi</h3>
<p>— Xu Songshi</p>
<p>Recently, as the war situation in southern Guangdong has become tense, place names such as "Na Chen Xu" and "Na Xiao Xu" are often seen in the newspapers. Do readers know the meaning of these place names? Originally, these were place names of the Zhuang people of Guangdong and Guangxi. Na Chen is located in the northeast of Qin County, Guangdong. Na Xiao is located directly south of Yongning, Guangxi. The Zhuang people call fields "Na" and thatch "Xiao." Na Chen is Chenchu, and Na Xiao is Thatch Field. Don't you think these place names are very interesting?</p>
<p>In the southwestern corner of Guangdong, the former Qin Prefecture, and in the area around the Liujiang River in western Guangxi, there are still many Zhuang people. In eastern Yunnan and southwestern Guizhou, there are also Zhuang residents. The names of their smaller tribes vary from place to place. They are called Huai, Zhong, Ya, Mulao, or Tulao. Generally, they are all Zhuang. Even the Li people on Hainan Island, Guangdong, can be called Zhuang in a broad sense.</p>
<p>What kind of people are these Zhuang people? Readers must be eager to know. The character Zhuang was originally written as Zhuang, and its pronunciation is the same as Zhuang. The name Zhuang originally originated in the Song Dynasty. The author has been studying the ancient history of Lingnan for more than ten years. It has now been clearly proven that the Zhuang people were the original aborigines of Guangdong and Guangxi. The original aborigines of Guangdong and Guangxi were definitely not Yao, not to mention Miao. Even those in Guangdong and Guangxi who claim to be descendants of the Han from the Central Plains have a mixture of Zhuang blood in them.</p>
<p>These Zhuang are also the purest Han people in China today. Since the Eastern Jin Dynasty, the Han people of the Central Plains have mixed with the blood of the Huns, Turks, and Xianbei. We know that the word Han originated from the East and West Han Rivers, and the areas around the East and West Han Rivers were originally inhabited by Zhuang compatriots. The author has carefully studied the Zhuang language and knows that the Zhuang people call men Lehan, which means Son of Han. The Zhuang language is inverted, and Son of Han means Hanzi. The Zhuang people have always called themselves Hanzi, but the Han people in the Central Plains discriminated against them, which is a very unjust thing.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the Zhuang belong to the ancient Southern Han people. Since the Yellow Emperor defeated the Yan Emperor, most of the Zhuang people were assimilated by the Northern Han people. Those who lived in the southwest and were less assimilated became the so-called Zhuang people in later generations. The difference between Zhuang and Mandarin today is only equal to the different sounds of Qi, Chu, Han, and Wei during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. Shuowen Xiezi said, "After Confucius's death, the princes fought for power and did not obey the king. They hated the harm that ritual and music did to themselves and abandoned their harmony. They were divided into seven countries, with different languages and different languages." The author has repeatedly asked Zhuang friends about the meaning of Lehan. According to them, Le is Son, and Lehan is just a different form of the character Zi. What is so strange about the uniqueness of the Zhuang language?</p>
<p>The author has traveled to the Zhuang area many times. The most recent one was after the start of the war in South China. Starting from Guilin, I traveled all over northern and western Guizhou and the southwest of Guangdong Province. The purpose was to investigate the general historical relics of the Zhuang. In this great era, these Zhuang compatriots are excited and enterprising, which deeply moved me.</p>
<p>"What are the views of your Zhuang compatriots on the Chinese nation today?" The author asked a Zhuang township chief in Longsheng County, Guangxi. This Zhuang township chief, whose surname is, replied: "The Zhuang people are Han people. In Guangxi, there is not a single Zhuang person who is not a descendant of the Yellow Emperor. Because since Di Qing pacified the South during the Huangyou period of the Song Dynasty, hundreds of thousands of troops from the Central Plains stayed in the four borders of Guangxi and married Zhuang women. For ten years, the boundaries between the local and guest people have long been completely eliminated. We Zhuang people are not only descendants of the Han, but also descendants of the brave soldiers under the command of Di Xiang Wu Gong. The descendants of soldiers should have the spirit of soldiers. There are many Zhuang people in Long. This province is handling military service, and Longsheng District completed the procedures the earliest. The spirit of soldiers is fully demonstrated. This is the concept of our Zhuang compatriots towards the Chinese nation." These few words clearly show the greatness and excellence of the Zhuang compatriots.</p>

<p>Economic Common Sense</p>
<h3>Currency Settlement</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yuanqing</p>
<p>Currency settlement is a product of foreign exchange and trade controls. The methods implemented in our country's foreign exchange control and trade regulation are fivefold: (1) prohibition of imports and a quota licensing system; (2) exemptions from taxes, surcharges, and insurance premiums as incentives for exports; (3) state control of trade in tea, bristles, tung oil, and minerals; (4) restrictions on withdrawals and remittances to prevent capital flight; and (5) centralized foreign exchange settlement for the re-export of native products. Currency settlement is the system within the fifth item, which is what I intend to elaborate on:</p>
<p>The "Foreign Exchange Application Procedure" was promulgated on March 12, 1938. At that time, exporters holding foreign exchange were willing to sell it on the black market for a higher price, but importers preferred to purchase it from the Central Bank because its legal exchange rate was more favorable. Under these circumstances, the national bank only sold official exchange rates and did not buy them. If it wanted to cover its positions, it would have to seek the black market, incurring significant losses due to the difference between the legal and black market prices. Therefore, in mid-June of the same year, export settlement regulations were successively promulgated. The purpose was to concentrate the foreign exchange generated by exporters' exports in the hands of the government. The regulations included four articles, the "Postal Parcel Foreign Exchange Settlement Method" and three supplementary methods for related precautions. The four regulations were the "Regulations on the Method for Merchants to Export Goods and Settle Foreign Exchange," "Types of Export Goods Subject to Foreign Exchange Settlement and Methods Thereof," "Precautions for Handling the Export of Goods and the Settlement of Foreign Exchange," and "Implementation Regulations for the Export of Goods and the Settlement of Foreign Exchange."</p>
<p>On July 2nd of this year, three articles of the "Measures for Claiming Foreign Exchange Settlement Difference" were promulgated, stipulating that exporters of goods who settle foreign exchange with the government may, based on the settlement documents, claim the difference between the legal price and the listed price of the Bank of Communications from the settling bank. This is to reduce the costs of merchants and encourage exports. It is found that there are currently three exchange rates in China: one is the legal price of 14.5 pence per yuan of the Central Bank, one is the actual price listed by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications (recently 7 pence), and the third is the black market price (recently around 8.5 pence). The difference mentioned here refers to the difference between the legal price of 14.5 pence and the actual price listed by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. The statement, "the government will incur losses due to the difference between the legal price and the black market price," refers to the difference between the legal price and the black market price (the black market price in June last year was around 8 pence). However, since the "Rules for Applying for Foreign Exchange to Purchase Imported Goods" were promulgated on July 1st of this year, importers have been required to pay a balancing fee equal to the difference between the legal price and the price listed by the Bank of China. In short: Since the "Rules for Applying for Foreign Exchange" were promulgated, the government has been supplying foreign exchange at the Bank of Communications' exchange rate, and if it needs to cover its positions in the black market—between buying and selling—it can only suffer losses within the range between the Bank of Communications' price and the black market price.</p>
<p>Regarding the types of goods subject to currency settlement, the "Regulations on the Types of Export Goods Subject to Foreign Exchange Settlement and Methods Thereof" originally stipulated 24 types: tung oil, bristles, tea, mineral sands, cowhide, egg products, gallnuts, sheepskin, wool, medicinal materials, silk, straw hats, human hair, ramie, sausage casings, cotton, peanuts, sesame, tobacco, wood, bamboo, almonds, duck feathers, and animal hides. In January of this year, for the sake of benefiting merchants, the Ministry of Finance removed ten types from the 24 types, combining sheepskin and animal hides into a single category of leather goods. The goods subject to foreign exchange settlement were reduced to 13 types: tung oil, bristles, tea, minerals, leather, leather goods, gallnuts, medicinal materials, wool, silk, ramie, sausage casings, and feathers. At the end of September, the Ministry of Finance telegraphed the Zhejiang Customs: "Regardless of whether native products are suitable for export or not, foreign exchange settlement must be carried out before shipment is approved." As a result, the scope of goods subject to foreign exchange settlement has been further expanded.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the entire country, in addition to increasing foreign exchange reserves, currency settlement can also strengthen control over domestic exchange. Because the legal tender in the occupied areas is beyond the reach of the National Government's authority, it is impossible to effectively manage it and make it circulate in a way that benefits the national economy. Therefore, it interferes with domestic exchange, hoping to reduce the surplus floating capital in this area. The specific methods probably include raising premiums, encouraging the transfer of capital to the interior to participate in production and construction, raising discounts, setting quotas, and restricting remittances to the occupied areas. However, some merchants, firms, and financial institutions that value profit over righteousness offer better terms than official banks to attract remittances, indirectly profiting from exchange rate differences. This situation is mostly a type of settlement where "matched positions are equal." Except for being subject to the constraint of "matched positions being equal," it is completely free exchange, which contradicts the National Government's intervention policy. Articles 2 and 3 of the "Measures for Claiming Foreign Exchange Settlement Difference" promulgated in early July clearly stipulate that the legal tender obtained from foreign exchange settlement with the Bank of China and the legal tender obtained from claiming the difference shall be paid by the Bank of China in the interior. The intention is to force exporters to remit the legal tender obtained from exports to the interior through the Bank of China, so as to reduce the funds available to the above-mentioned profiteering institutions for free exchange with the interior. Therefore, currency settlement actually contains the effect of strengthening control over domestic exchange. Because the strengthening of control over domestic exchange can reduce the floating capital in the occupied areas.</p>
<h3>Two Famous Quotes</h3>
<p>— Zhou</p>
<p>(1) Dr. Lewitt, Psychologist:</p>
<p>Correct thoughts and life, coupled with physical and mental exercise and development, will make your ingenious machine (referring to the human body) work harmoniously and without harm for you. You also have great abilities, which others rely on to achieve success and happiness; because your self-confidence is shaken, your life becomes abnormal, just like a short circuit in a battery, and the current dries up. These can all be corrected.</p>
<p>(2) At the beginning of life, the creator did not designate someone to be poor, someone to be rich, someone to fail, or someone to succeed; childhood training, environment, and companions have a great influence on the formation of good and bad habits. But these habits and trends can be changed. We are born into the world like a piece of clay, which can be carved into various shapes. Everything about us is not predetermined, but can be controlled by ourselves, so everyone "should understand" the importance of taking good care of oneself.</p>

<h3>Overview of the Beggar Shelter</h3>
<p>— Fuyun</p>
<p>The beggar shelter in this city is run by the Salvation Army International. The shelter is located at the intersection of Avenue Paul Flat and Rue Mgr Favier in the French Concession and is attached to the Second Reception Center of the International Relief Committee. It occupies four thatched sheds, which are divided into offices, a director's office, a women's room, a workshop, a police station, and beggar dormitories. There are currently over 600 beggars, including 50 to 60 female beggars, ranging from old women in their fifties or sixties to little girls around ten years old. Most of these beggars are sent to the shelter after being arrested by the French Concession police. Some are also sent by charitable organizations. Christian churches such as Moore Memorial Church also send some from time to time. In the shelter, they are not called by name. Like the vagrant workhouses of the past, they are all called by number. Most of them are beggars who are wandering the streets without food or clothing. Regardless of gender, most are addicted to opium, heroin, morphine injections, and other drugs.</p>
<p>Daily Life: They get up at 6:00 AM every morning and wipe the large pot (the dough water is placed in a vat, with ten people standing around each vat, wiping it with ten towels). At 6:30 AM, they gather in the playground. The staff (referring to those who work in the shelter) eat porridge at this time. At 7:30 AM, they run. At 8:30 AM, they enter the shed, each preparing bowls and chopsticks (each person has two bowls and a pair of bamboo chopsticks issued by the shelter). At 9:00 AM, they eat porridge, eating as much as they can. After eating, they sunbathe in the open air. Except on cloudy and rainy days, they are absolutely prohibited from sitting or sleeping on their beds during the day. At 4:00 PM, they eat rice with vegetables or radish soup, or green vegetable soup. Pickled vegetables are distributed every three or four days to eat with the porridge. Every night at 7:00 PM, the clerk takes roll call in each shed. After roll call, they go to bed. Those addicted to drugs are given medicine by a female nurse in the shed at 3:00 PM every afternoon. In case of illness, they report to the section chief or the clerk, who takes medicine from the International First Reception Center to administer. Seriously ill or elderly people are transferred to the ward, where the ward section chief and a temporary worker take turns to care for them. In the event of death, the remains are dealt with by the Tongren Funeral Parlor. If they abide by the rules and remain quiet in the shelter for three months, they can be released, but only after completing the guarantor procedures; otherwise, they cannot go out freely.</p>
<p>Overview of Services: The shelter has a special police station, staffed by a group of police officers dispatched by the police station, who are stationed in the shelter to guard the gate and maintain order within the shelter. In addition, the International Second Reception Center selects refugees who are capable of working to serve as section chiefs, who are responsible for managing the gate, providing service, and other tasks. They receive 3 yuan per month for food expenses. Each shed has a section chief and a deputy section chief, as well as a clerk, who is responsible for managing clothing, bedding, personnel, and medicine in the shed. Temporary workers are also selected from the residents of the shed (those who work in the shelter without food money are called temporary workers), a dozen or so, who are responsible for carrying rice (the rice is cooked in the Second Reception Center), cleaning (sweeping), sanitation (removing feces), and also barbering and tailoring. These tasks are said to be performed by residents selected from the masses in the shelter.</p>
<p>Production Work: Young people and children over ten years old are selected, and they currently only do wicker basket work. The small ones are the size of mesh baskets, and the large ones are similar to millet baskets. These wicker baskets are sold to foreign firms for foreigners to use.</p>
<p>Clothing and Bedding Distribution: The clothes of the beggars who enter the shelter are all tattered. The shelter issues a set of gray cloth cotton-padded jackets and trousers. Two people share a quilt, which is made of black cloth inside and out. The beds are bunk beds arranged in upper and lower tiers, made of bamboo slats. The bed boards are also made of bamboo slats.</p>
<p>Management and Other Matters: Because most of the beggars in the shelter are unruly and have a dissolute lifestyle, management must be strict. In addition to the two Chinese policemen guarding the gate in shifts, there are policemen stationed at the corners of the walls and the toilet pits to prevent escapes. The prescribed daily routines must be strictly followed. For example, if they do not get up at 6:00 AM, they will have to eat "fried dough sticks" (two rattan strips twisted together like fried dough sticks), bound with iron wire on the outside. Breaking a rice bowl means eating bamboo shoot braised pork (being beaten with bamboo boards, knocking broken rice bowls, and having to endure ten hits of the bamboo board). Losing chopsticks results in ten strikes. Smoking is absolutely prohibited. When entering the shelter, everyone's body is thoroughly searched. If smoking is discovered in the shelter, they will be spanked forty times. These stubborn beggars, after being disciplined in the shelter for three months, have their habits greatly changed. This is also due to the management of the shelter.</p>
<h3>Aesthetic Sensibilities of Various Ethnic Groups</h3>
<p>— Yue Qian</p>
<p>White people admire high noses, even using pliers to clamp the nose into a sharp and high shape, believing it to be beautiful.</p>
<p>Native women in northern New Guinea, Australia, string wooden sticks horizontally through their noses, believing it to be beautiful.</p>
<p>Women in Borneo, South Asia, have their ears pierced when they are young and wear earrings. They increase the number of earrings every year. The heavier the earrings, the longer the skin of the drooping ears becomes after middle age, reaching more than a foot in length. Many have a large number of earrings dangling under their earlobes, and the people there consider it beautiful.</p>
<p>Arab women often wear nose rings in their nostrils as ornaments.</p>
<p>Some uncivilized natives in the Philippines regard filing teeth to a point as the only beauty of women. Although filing teeth is extremely painful, they are not afraid because of their love of beauty.</p>
<p>Black people in Africa regard tile-shaped lips as beautiful. Women have their lips cut open when they are young and insert circular wooden blocks. As they get older, their lips become larger.</p>
<p>Ladies in civilized countries apply ice cream to their faces every day to make their skin delicate and white as snow, which they consider to be the supreme beauty.</p>
<h3>Characteristics of the Finnish People</h3>
<p>— Yingdai</p>
<p>First of all, we want to point out that the Finnish people are all able to endure hardship, tolerate hard work, and have a sense of unity. Therefore, in this war against the Soviet Union, their soldiers are able to fight bravely. Facts tell us that in modern warfare, the superiority of weapons alone is not enough. Finland's ability to resist strongly this time is due to its advantageous terrain as a major reason, but human factors are also the main factor.</p>
<p>It is said that the Finnish people were originally of Mongoloid stock. Before the 13th century AD, they migrated to Finland and have lived there ever since. Located in Northern Europe, the weather is cold, so due to geographical reasons, they have developed a strong physique and a spirit of hard work. Until 1809, they were ruled by Sweden for almost five centuries. From 1809 to 1917, Finland was part of Russia. Although it was autonomous, the Finnish people had a hostile attitude towards Russia at that time. On October 7, 1917, it became independent and established a new republic.</p>
<p>It has only been 20 years since then. However, in the past 20 years, because the Finnish people have been able to cooperate and operate diligently, they have built everything in Finland very well in a very short period of time, and it is like a brand-new country.</p>
<p>Education in Finland is also very developed. Schools are widely available throughout the country, so the number of illiterates among the people is also very low. Moreover, they have been able to implement democratic policies. Women have long been granted the right to vote and, like men, have the right to vote at the age of 21. Whether in law or education, men and women are equal. The Finnish people also pay great attention to sports, especially in long-distance running, where they have had many outstanding talents. To this day, they still hold many world records in long-distance running. Therefore, one of the reasons why the Finnish people have a strong physique, are able to endure hardship, and love sports in peacetime is that they practice sports!</p>
<p>Finland's lakes and swamps! Finland has many lakes and swamps, which are natural fortifications. Due to the climate and geography, it is extremely difficult for the Soviet Union to attack.</p>

<h3>Hitler's Sister</h3>
<p>— Shijie</p>
<p>The world-famous Hitler has a younger sister living in Vienna, Austria. She originally worked in an insurance company writing envelopes, and her monthly salary was barely enough to live on. After it was discovered that she was the sister of the leader of the National Socialist Party, she lost her job. Later, no business dared to hire her again. Therefore, she had to rely on Hitler's allowance to live. But she was often distressed by relying on others for a living. She often told her friends that her greatest happiness would be to be able to support herself one day.</p>
<p>Her current life is extremely simple. The rent for her house is only 14 yuan per month. She does not hire a servant at home and handles all the housework herself. Although she uses her real name to register, her neighbors only know her as Mrs. Wolf. The reason she wants to hide from them is to avoid being pestered by uninvited guests. A newspaper that did not know what was good for it exposed her secret, so visitors came in an endless stream, and she had no choice but to take refuge in a friend's house. She also received countless letters; some asked her to intervene in her brother's behavior on behalf of the letter writers, some were full of flattery, and some were full of abuse. She hated both of these types of letters.</p>
<p>Miss Paula Hitler loves to live quietly, rarely chats with her neighbors, and only receives a few friends on weekdays. She goes to Germany once a year and spends a few weeks with her brother.</p>
<p>Scientific Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Surprising Weight</h3>
<p>— Guan</p>
<p>It is a good deal for Ningbo people to come to Shanghai to do business. For example, a boatload of salted crabs or fresh ribbonfish is transported from Ningbo to Shanghai. Regardless of how much interest they charge, just in terms of weight alone, it has already increased a little. But this is not because the scales used are different.</p>
<p>It turns out that objects only have weight because of the earth's gravity. The closer to the earth's center, the more gravity is received, and the heavier the object is. Weighing something on a high mountain is lighter than weighing it on the ground. This has been tested many times. Now our earth is not "perfectly round." The equator is more bulging, and the two poles are closer to the earth's center. At the same time, the earth rotates day and night without rest. All the moving plants, animals, and minerals on its surface would have been thrown into outer space by its "centrifugal force" if there were no gravity. Therefore, "centrifugal force" offsets a part of the weight, and this centrifugal force is particularly strong on the equator. For the above two reasons, something weighing 1,000 pounds at the poles will only weigh 995 pounds when carried to the equator with the original scale. If it is carried back to the poles, 1,000 pounds is the exact weight.</p>
<p>Therefore, the closer an object on the equator moves north or south, the heavier it becomes, until it reaches the North Pole or the South Pole. Shanghai is north of Ningbo, so the goods from Ningbo should theoretically be a little heavier in Shanghai. For example, Paris and Chicago are not very far apart in the north-south direction. Something weighing 2,000 pounds in Paris only weighs 1,998 pounds when weighed in Chicago. However, it is not necessary to calculate a salted crab or a fresh ribbonfish. One boatload, ten boatloads, a hundred boatloads... will naturally fluctuate a little, but in any case, the Ningbo merchants did not include these benefits in their calculations.</p>
<p>The above is just talking about the earth. If we talk about the stars, it is even more surprising. Recently, astronomers discovered a white dwarf star. It is said that on that planet, a cubic inch of ordinary material weighs 9,000 tons. On Earth, platinum is considered to have a relatively large specific gravity, but a cubic inch is only a little over two pounds.</p>
<h3>Notes on Small Knowledge</h3>
<p>Some American students conducted such an experiment! They gathered ten beautiful and strong female shop assistants, asked them to wear rubber gloves, and each took a sterilized basin and kissed the edge of the basin once. Then they immediately analyzed it, and the result was that each kiss left 20 to 550 bacteria. They also tested lipstick in the same way, proving that lipstick is a place for bacteria to breed.</p>
<p>The largest movie theater in the world is in Moscow. It is a park covering two acres that can accommodate more than 20,000 spectators. The screen is 500 square feet in size, and the projector's light intensity is one million candles.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles, USA, there are certain people who specialize in repairing car lights. If they find a car with a broken light at night, they will ride a motorcycle or bicycle to catch up and tell them, "A light on your car is broken, and the police will fine you. Fix it quickly!" It costs half a dollar each time, and the average weekly income is 250 yuan, because on average, one out of forty cars has a broken light.</p>
<p>The Hungarian capital has a radio station with an antenna 297 feet high and weighing 580 tons, capable of generating 120 kilowatts. It is placed on a porcelain insulator. This porcelain insulator is circular, with a diameter of three feet, but its thickest part is only three feet.</p>
