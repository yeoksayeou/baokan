<p>社評</p>
<h3>南海危機與越南</h3>
<p>德國對英的閃電攻勢至今尙無即將發動的朕兆，南中國海的風雲日來却又見緊張。據說，日方越南設置軍事根據地的交涉方在淮行，從七月下旬開始的南海日艦隊移動連日更達到嚴重程度。就表面而論，近來最能吸引全世界注目的事件殆無過於英日相互對於僑民的逮捕，但只要日政府不改變其現行的「靜觀態度」，則此一件糾紛未嘗不能由緩和而暫趨消釋；至於南太平洋的危機，則有方興未艾之觀。那一地帶的複雜局勢與各種弱點，在目前情况之下，對於橫暴之來，未必能作有力有效的抗拒，這也就是日方之所以公然把越南荷印以至印緬菲島都囊括在其「新秩序」、之內的原因。假如英德戰事再進入短兵相搏的階段，那必更是遠東侵略者實施其南進抱負的良好時機。</p>
<p>在南洋那許多單位之中，日方覬覦最甚的自然是荷印，而危機最迫切的則無過越南。越雨的經濟資源雖亦可觀，但終不逮荷印；而其軍略上的價値則比荷印爲高，因爲要實行南進，則越南的陸上與海岸，正是最重要的軍事據點：即以中國的海南島而論，似乎總綰南海，然而不能在南中國海的西岸獲得有力的陸海軍根據地，則那一方面的爭奪戰必將感到加倍艱難；故南島的重要，實屬不如越南。何况自從南海諸島先後被日方所佔有，密通越南北境的邕龍一帶復遭侵擾，越南雖重要，却已有遙被控制之觀。因此之故，日本方面更可利用中越領土的密接，以「解決中國事變」的口號，實行其一石雙烏的方法。旣獲得進擾中國西南後方的便利，更可掩蓋其南進侵略的企圖；不像荷印之旣有英美之重大關切，更與日軍後方遠相隔絕。這樣　無怪其對於荷印還只是談判與調查，而對於法越則已在操刀而試了。</p>
<p>世人欲求對於南海危機獲得眞實瞭解，必須首先祛除種種烟幕的渚惑。三年以來，日方對第三國家的攻勢，幾無不以「解決中國事變」一類口號為籍口以脅迫其讓步。各國為所　蔽，而中國受累有限，第三國則損害無窮，這種例證幾乎舉不勝舉。即以越南當局允諾日力禁運要求而言，據六日合衆社的消息，日力已利用此一權利從事逾越範圍的活動：甚至要求在越設立海軍根據地，這不但抵觸法國主權，且也決難解釋爲了應付根本沒有海軍的中國的軍事需要。但這種烟慕外交，前此已經一再瞞過世人，且更瞞過列强當局，使他們不惜拋棄正義公道以至法理立場，以迎合侵略者的意旨。列强這種缺乏警覺和遠見的措施，正是促成最近南太平洋危局的重要原因。記得當去春日軍侵佔海南島之始，中國最高當局即已指出其爲太平洋的「九一八一，可惜那一警語並未在國際間引起應有的反應，早做曲突徙薪的有力預防。最近英國封鎖滇緬路的措置曾以英國正從事於生死戰爭理由爲辯護，而法越當局對日方要求的屈伏，又是因爲適當兵敗求和之餘，故無力加以抗拒；關於這些，姑不加以質辯；但是當這種惡劣命運尙未屆臨之前，何以也迄未考慮到遠東未來危機而早作未雨綢繆之計，這就不能不診斷於當代若干列强的當局，習於苟安，且欠缺遠大的眼光，正直的氣魄了。</p>
<p>據路透社所傳維希方面消息：法方對日態度已轉趨堅强，且決抵抗對越南的任何攻擊，在軍事方面亦已從事準備。這種消息，眞是令人興空谷足音之感，在德法和約中曾允許法國存留相當海軍以防護其殖民地，越南的防禦實力却仍舊薄弱得可憐；日人方面甚至傲岸異常，謂祇要一個師團，即可予以征服。是以法方縱具決心，倘不亟作敏捷的措施，難期有效的自衛。其實，法國在歐陸固已被德義所挾持，在遠東却仍舊有其活動的自由。第一，要認淸所謂加强德義聯繫只是日方的片面幻想，對於日方攫取法國屬領的企圖，德義不只未必予以鼓勵，且適中其忌。法越當局應該認識這一矛盾，以增強越南的軍備。第二，英法在遠東仍舊具有相同的利害和立場，臨到緊急關頭，仍應捐棄嫌怨，根據以往聯防原則，共謀有效措置。對於其他在遠東具有重大權益的國家，有如美國，更應從事積極聯絡和運用。第三，要認清中國的抗議始終是安定遠東的重要因素，有如最近華軍　桂越滇越邊境的加緊佈防，龍州水口扶南一帶的反攻，固屬爲了鞏固中國後方、同時也是减輕越南所受的壓迫。法越當局不只不應續採危害中國抗戰的舉措，且應與之密切聯繫，共謀保障南亞大陸的安全。在歷史上，中越曾有血統上的關聯，在現實關係上，中越更有分不開的利害。</p>
<p>在歐洲的戰敗，固使法國陷入悲慘的深淵，但如果能在遠東以堅强而正確的運用獲得保衛越南的成功，那也必然會形成復興法國的基點，願以此意期之於今日之法越當局。</p>
<h3>拘捕僑民事件　日向英聲明立場　待英方反應再作行動　新加坡加緊軍事戒備</h3>
<p>東京　日外相松岡咋告內閣、日政府巳以日本對英帝國內日僑遭「無理」逮捕事之立塲、通知英政府、日政府今候英方反應、而後採取滴當行動云、（七日路透社電）</p>

<h3>歐戰實錄（四）　英法聯軍的退却</h3>
<p>五月中旬，德軍猛攻法蘭特斯。時英軍在法境作戰者，有三十餘萬之衆。支持至六月初，聯軍已無法招架，祇得設法渡過海峽，撤退回國。卒在德軍重砲飛機猛烈轟擊之下，仗其紀律及堅强精神，藉軍艦運輸艦及大小船隻千餘艘，於氣候惡劣及驚風駭浪之中，造成空前未有之大撒退。損失軍隊的三萬人，大砲千尊，輜重軍需無數。在軍事上，此種撤退雖吿成功，但不能目爲勝利。惟由另一方面視之，德軍費盡心機，用了九牛二虎之力，原想一網打盡，結果僅落得人家「全師而退」，自當感覺失望，本文係英軍米特蘭團軍曹華治華斯Sergeant　Jack　Wadsworth親歷之二十一日作戰經過。彼會擔任後衛，且係自鄧扣克後撒退，茲將原文迻譯如次。</p>
<p>我軍駐紮法國西部角落裏，已經有半個月之久，看不到英女報紙，簡直有些與世隔絕的樣子。幸而軍營中有人備有無綫電收音機，偶爾收聽外界消息。禮拜日那天，從無綫電中得知德軍已開始侵犯荷蘭與比利時了。</p>
<p>得到這個消息之後，大家朱免喜形於色。弟兄們都說，「時機到了，我們可向德軍痛擊矣」。在此緊急關頭，我軍便「枕戈待旦」。</p>
<p>在這軍營中的最後一天，是一個炎暑逼人，而又是晴明可愛的一天。那天午後，並不操演，我便的了一位弟兄出外散步。經過法國人村巷，農人們正在耕種。到了村中一家咖啡店，飲了幾杯啤酒，解解苦悶。</p>
<p>回營後，聽說立刻就要開拔，但是那天晚上一切還是照舊，好像戰事還遠在幾千哩路之外。翌晨，六點半起身喇叭，却提早在五點三刻就吹號排隊了。弟兄們難免有些紛亂，可是大家都能提起精神。未幾，團長來向我們訓話。他所講的話並不多，祇道，「弟兄們，我們要開拔了。什麼時候走，和到什麼地方去，我一概都不知道。散隊後，就可進早餐。然後把一切預備起來」。他停了一刻工夫又說，現在大家可以實現此次被派遣來此目的了。他問隊裏有沒有人，不像他那樣高興的。我們齊聲喊道，「沒有」！他露了牙齒笑了一笑，然後移步他去。</p>
<p>午後，命令傳到，全隊人馬乘火車，開到倫納車站。下車在路旁樹蔭下等待了許多時候，等所有的輜重配備上車。大批軍隊開拔眞不容易。一小時內無論如何不能齊備。直到晚上十時半，始再行登車，大家疲倦不堪，倒頭便睡。</p>
<p>一速兩天兩夜，火車轔轔前進，中間不時有長時間的停頓。有時候我們所坐的火車停在支綫，等待軍需快車開過。第二天，看見難民車，迎頭馳來，飛掠而過。車上吃的東西很多，不過多是些罐頭食物，因此，覺得小刀後端所裝開罐器，倒是出征軍人的好朋友呢</p>
<p>中途所經過的幾個車站，常看　子們提了茶壺躍奔下車，在月臺上冲沸水。壺中早就盛着，茶葉方糖。這種沸水是車上用電報通知站員供給的。我聽說上决歐戰時，兵士搭車開赴前綫，中途要吃茶，非得在火車「龍頭」中榨取開水不可。這决我們對於茶水問題倒獲得圓滿解決了。可惜洗澡問題，尙成懸案，所以我們一到終點，個人都像烟囱裏抓出來的了。</p>
<p>此行終點叫做栖克林，在黎爾之南。我們在站外整隊，不多一歇，忽來了空襲警報。這種警報，有許多人還是初次聽到，官兵們都忙亂起來，架起了高射砲。但是結果白費心思，祇在雲端裏看見三架敵機。雲端裏忽然出現我軍戰鬥機兩架，於是敵機便失其所在了</p>
<p>空襲警報旣經解除，我們在菓園中吃了些東西，便越過火車軌，走到橋邊。我們始怵然大悟爲什麼我軍在比利時邊界勾留如此短促。從月看去，東邊鐵道上面橫有一架德國鉅型轟炸機的殘骸，鐵軌已被扭裂。工人們正在那裏淸除一切。我們又在橋端登上巨大載重車，直向前進，但仍不知究往何處。</p>
<p>直到貼近了比利時邊界，纔第一次接觸着戰時景象。我們所乘的載重車本來每小時行三十英里。因爲逃往法境的難民如潮湧來，路上寒滿了各式各樣的車輛，我們的載重車祇得减低速率，慢得像蝸牛行了。難民扶老携幼，景象凄慘。我們雖則經過了四天的顚簸，除了假寐以外，毫未休息，也已疲倦不堪，然而看到了這幅哀鴻圖後，大家未免熱血沸騰，要與德軍交交手了。</p>
<p>最後到了目的地，——叫做烏勃根，在布魯塞爾之西四十英里，白魯塞爾大道直通該處</p>
<p>薄暮，我們下車步行入菓　園，德國空軍很活動。他們飛來的時候，大概一次有三十架，都是中型轟炸機，飛得並不高。我所引以爲奇的，他們爲什麼不循大路轟炸，路上充塞着許多車輛，軍用的和難民的都有，大部份都向西駛行。</p>
<p>看到這種車輛行駛的情形，我始恍然大悟，這種情形，不是開拔前進，而是在撒退了。我國任務是要開得愈遠愈　，以便擔任後衛。接連好幾天，我們一些消息也得不到。有一天：我想起來是五月十五日。弟兄們中有一個能說法國話的，從難民口中得悉，比京附近正在激戰。</p>
<p>那天晚上，我們在烏勃根附近農舍中躭擱一宵。廚子打起精神弄了一餐熱飯，這是開拔以來第一次。晚間實行嚴厲的燈火管制，我夜間常常起來，蹀躞於黑暗之中，看看弟兄們有沒有遵守命令。澈夜聽到大隊德機在空中嗡嗡來往。</p>
<p>每天早晨，我們扌明白我們的職務。全隊人馬便分駐大路各要口，指揮交通，使難民走向田間不得留滯路上，以便敵軍攻到時，遏截作戰。</p>
<p>早晨五點鐘，我軍架起戰車防禦砲。指揮難民眞是困難。他們只能講法蘭特斯土話，彼此言語隔閡。如做手勢叫他們離開大路，他們只做不知，還是沿着路蹣跚前進。吾則便坐下哭泣不已。我們當然不能用暴力來驅逐婦孺，尋至一籌莫展。直到弟兄們想出一種方法，阻止了爲首前進的幾個難民，向他們做手勢，朝天指着，再指向路上，然後用可怕的神色對他們說，「炸彈」！說完之後，我們可笑着指指田野，揮手叫他們走向那邊去。這個方法居然奏效。</p>
<p>馬路上車輛行人肅淸之後，遠處隆隆砲聲漸聽漸近。那天淸早，把一營後衛兵放了過去。他們在西爾培運河沿岸遏阻德軍前進，身經劇戰。然而他們仍非常高興，一路搖擺而去，好像走上白金罕皇宮大道</p>
<p>中午，尙未與德軍交綏，又奉到撤退令。路上車輛已很稀疏。奉令撤退，未免有些喪氣，但因兵力薄弱，加之後無掩蔽，亦屬英維無用武之地。我們就開始撤退，直到深夜一時半，走了二十五英里。有些弟兄便在一家沒有人住的農舍中歇足。我則睡在擱樓下地板上，倒還舒服。</p>
<p>翌日又行二十英里，在一個形同廢墟的村中過夜。一到天明，德國飛機卽開始向這村莊轟炸掃射，連續至兩小時之久。村道中雖擠滿了我軍運輸車，我軍却並沒有死傷。高射砲火把他們目標迷住，終把他們驅散了。後來幾天中，我從未看到德國飛機飛近目標轟炸。準確的高射砲火當然爲他們所怕懼，但我看到我軍噴火式戰鬥機一架出現時，五六架德機便逃得無影無蹤了。</p>
<p>接着又是退却——第二天二十英里，再一天又是二十英里。德機總是成羣結隊跟着轟炸掃射。我們咬緊牙關，邁頭前進。不時看到隊伍前後，炸彈爆炸的烟火，一篷一篷的飛起，又聽得呼喊救護隊的聲音接速着而起。但就大體上說，死傷人數並不多。</p>
<p>在這樣連續不斷的轟炸中，我們武裝行軍，非常疲乏。但一天午後，我們經過某部隊，他們就是三天之前在布魯塞爾大道上穿過我軍防綫的。他們正停留路旁進食，在這三天之中，他們已走了七十五英里了。</p>
<p>那天晚上，我們到達栖克林——重返了五天前我們出發的地點。一到那裏，就有車輛，漏夜把我們送到離杜亞七里的一個地方，那裏只見城中火燄冲天。我們在黑夜之中等待命令，有些弟兄們竟站立着睡着了。杜亞受到排砲和飛機的更番轟炸，天空中且有德機所放的許多照明彈，弄得像白　一般，命令終於到達了，吩咐我軍沿運河堤岸掘壕堅守，其時敵人的離杜亞五英里之遙。</p>

<h3>金融　外匯結款殊盛　洋米一項為數亦鉅</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、滙豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美匯暗市、晨初忽露鬆象、但曇花一現、不久卽吿緊縮、始以美行等供意殷切、投機商亦略售出、再因匯兌吿長五分二五之多、美滙五元七五成交頗夥、嗣華行金城納意甚佳、英洋行沙遜有吸胃、更聞進口商洋米結款浩繁、投機家轉來　扒、午刻匯豐亦有納　、其勢直步軟至午收、計英緊〇一五六二五、爲三便土七一八七五、美金案〇九三七五、爲五元六二五、平日交易、英少一美多、下午週三無市、</p>
<p>滙豊沙遜均進</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近升半便士、遠漲四三七五、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美不動、對滬亦平、美對英長五分二五、對滬大二分、對法無市、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三便士七一八七五、美滙五元七一八七五、較之上日晚收，美平英緊〇一五·六二五、開後美行等供意甚殷、投機商亦來售出、市面帶硬、計美行賣予沙遜八月份美匯五元七五、又投機商出華行八月份美匯亦爲五元七五、而外行與華行對做同月美匯均吿五元七五、並九月份美匯做五元六五六二五、匯豐掛牌揭曉不動、白銀平衡稅揭曉增百一分之二·七五、此後洋行突來結納、爲數頗巨、而洋米結款亦殊浩繁、且一般賣戶見勢裏足不前、反而扒進者亦夥、致潛勢回軟、計洋行如沙遜等進外行八月份美滙五元六五六二五、進有利九月份美匯五元六二五、並十月期美匯價五元半、嗣匯豐於五元六二五、亦曾吃入外行現貨美匯若干、於是市面愈俏、收盤　美匯獨軟、英金未聞成交、結果英金仍三便士七一八七五、美匯五元六二五、本月英金與現貨一樣、美滙爲五元五九三七五、九月份英金三便士六八七五、美滙五元五三一二五、較之上日收市、英金期現均縮〇一五六二五、美匯現貨　本月份緊〇九三七五、九月份則軟一二五、午後週三無市、</p>
<p>香港美匯不定</p>
<p>香港七日週三電、今晨匯市開盤吿平、美匯獨呈動盪、英匯現期貨及日匯現貨、均站原盤、美匯現貨鬆一二五、爲二十二元六二五、（昨報爲二十二元半）、申匯現貨降二元、爲三百九十六元、十時十分平靜、申匯現貨回升三元、爲三百九十九元、十時二十五分吿平、美匯現貨回緊〇六二五、爲二十二元五六二五、申匯現貨續升一元、爲四百元、十一時三十分微軟、美匯現貨續緊〇六二五、爲二十二元半、其餘均無榮辱、下午週三無市、</p>
<p>天津匯價緊縮</p>
<p>天津七日（週三）電、今晨匯市開盤吿平、英匯現貨緊〇三一二五、爲三便士四〇六二五、美匯現貨縮一二五、爲五元一二五、申匯升一元半、爲一百十元〇五角、「聯鈔」暗盤回昂二元二角半、爲九十四元七角半、</p>
<h3>港票高達四元　花旗百元大票　同業間有拒收</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤跌後又漲、英美金鎊故亦跌後突漲、致吿各漲一元五角、英金票需要亦殷、價漲三角、美金票需要奇殷、聞因有少數同業、對百元大票有拒收說、致流通額頓吿短少、故午後一度抬至十七元九角、卒稍落至十七元八角半、比上日軋漲四角三分、香港票漲風甚熾、晚市高速四元、日金票需要未减、晚市續高至一元三角二分、朝鮮票供求相埒、市價站平、晚市仍站一元零九分半原價、</p>
<h3>英印銀價放長</h3>
<p>六日倫敦電、大條銀市、近期長半辨士、遠期長四三七五、大衆買進、少供給、市况平、收市後、市仍平、又紐約電、美銀價現貨勿更、孟買電、印銀價現貨長三安那、期貨均長二安那、市况平、成交單共二十五張、</p>
<h3>港幫一再吸收下　金市跌後又暴騰</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、賴人心振奮、交易暢旺、價由低直上、激成相當買風、初開僅五千五百四十元、乃外滙開出略硬之故、雖經金號銀號買進後而升達五千五百七十五元、未幾漲勢卽止、並會回撳十元、嗣以滙市轉緊、港幫委託猛吸、檯面賣聲消散、聞小錢莊間有　售、而衆寡懸殊、價卽跳出五千六百元關外、見五千六百三十元後、微落數十元、但最後買風、如金號等在進不已、抬至五千六百五十元最高價收市、結果較上日軋漲七十元、收後市面堅挺、據聞塲外暗盤最大做過五千六百八十元、午後週三無市、半天交易的近二千兩、銀樓飾金掛大十元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤以高價收盤</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以滙兌報長、美滙吿硬、開市賣氣尙濃、首由銀號出金號十兩、祇爲五千五百四十元、比隔昨做小四十元、嗣賴銀號曁金號扒進、不久卽回升三十五元、銀號進金號等五十兩、爲五千五百七十五元、旋某錢兌業空頭加碼、復見小達五千五百六十五元、後以滙市轉緊、一時買風陡起、證券幫銀號等爭向扒吸、且港幫暗中收撈、未幾卽出五千六百元大關後、再加金號亦來在扒、續漲三十元、金號進銀號三十兩、爲五千六百三十元、不意某證券幫突轉懷賣意、吐出不少、一度回跌至五千六百元關邊、然午刻買風再起、重吿向上、處於金號銀號幫競購下、又飛漲五十元、結果爲五千六百五十元、最高價收市、較上日晚收軋漲七十元、半天一百十元上落、現金號之本牌售出價、照烚赤較高十數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金赤掛大十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸五百七十元、迨至十一時二十元掛大十元、此後則無變動、計大同行改懸五百八十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<p>滙劃貼現平定</p>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、轉趨呆定、每千元當日之貼率、始終爲　貼進四十七元、貼出須四十九元、與上日價無異、錢業公會拆息、早午兩市均掛一角七分未更、</p>
<h3>證券　內債反動回小</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤、昨日市况、稍起回風、是亦連漲數日應有之趨勢、今日倘續再稍稍回落、必有空方之抵補、昨日上下午均有補空、十六號收進丁種依然不懈、餘如同順久豐仁昌等全日始終買進、上午聯益吸收亦不少、聯和先出後進、同康信孚收買亦甚力、惟怡泰德孚信昌同興及三十五號賣出較湧、致使午後市價稍稍回低、丁種最堅、各幫人氣穩定、空方逢小卽補、是空方把握仍無多方之堅强、一日市價結果、多數回小五分至一角半、獨丁種尙好起五分、成交總數約計八十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交中華書局股五——股、價爲三十元零二角半、</p>
<p>又衆業公所昨日股市、稍形呆滯、成交不旺、價格少變、祗會德豐新舊二股、俱甚活潑、趨勢竟晨堅昂、其間絕無回風、餘股則自晨初略漲後、立被賣方壓力　抵銷、價格與開盤無軒輊、</p>
<p>倫敦六日（週二）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、仍少變動、祗滙豐銀行股各跌一鎊、計英倫註册股爲六十二鎊、香港註册股爲六十五鎊、其餘均無榮辱、</p>
<h3>糧食　大宗洋米將到　——昨日先小後漲——</h3>
<p>現洋米市自上兩日速呈先緊後疲之局、昨則突反前態、轉現先疲後聚之格、乃晨初開市、賣買雙方、惕於餘勢、均在躍躇、心思家遂乘機復施欲擒故縱之慣技、大舉出籠、行情步步下降、迄中市已落元奇、若一號陳西貢祗五十七元半至五十七元、二號五十一元半、火絞五十六元半、小絞五十二元、當此一霎那間、一般心思家認時極已臨、陡改作風、衆皆反出爲進、喊聲迭起、於是大局一變爲　俏異常、售價節節回昂、結果統計全市先後一伏一起、適恢原盤、與前收價相仿、昨日並有汕頭幫問津現路各米、回籠二號西貢開價卽至六十二元半、二號暹邏自六十一元半大至六十二元半、乃與現米均比前日反漲半元、而二號暹米未報進口之轉口米則爲汕幫吸收、價乃昂至六十二元八角及六十三元、則比前日較大一元、全日現米開出七千包、原包回籠則有四五百噸、</p>
<p>粳糯國米、傳聞明暗盤交易亦屬供求相仿、平定無化、常幫鮮淸粳六十八元半至六十八元、南港早稻原包六十四五元、斛見六十一元半、六十一元、金溧特元六十一二元云云、</p>
<p>周油新粳到貨寥落仍祗有七石上市、且以天雨滂沱、人心堅俏、售價續升半元、開六十三元</p>
<p>洋米昨有一千三百八十八包到滬、係太古公司瓊州輪自香港裝來、停靠浦東本行碼頭起卸、聞本星期內尙有大量洋米到滬、華綸格蘭輪自暹羅運米來滬、今日可到、</p>
<h3>北幫辦下脚粉</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日交易稍見活絡、除本街零批日常需用外、客銷亦漸活動、聞北洋幫去路久靜、近以當地需要轉佳、故來電採辦滬粉、允以下脚粉更爲貪取、因其價格廉宜故也、南洋幫亦有少數指染、致市面頗有轉堅之象、二號粉‘牌及砲台雙鷹牌洋粉、售價均須十六元、成交的有四五千包、華粉本盤仍爲十五元、供應不多、日廠粉鳳凰牌先跌後緊、九月粉開過十三元八角、旋即回至上四元、其他各種雜牌粉、市面均吿平定、</p>
<p>小麥　咋市並無特殊開展新到各貨、大都扳守待機而脫、日廠與華廠亦未放價貪取、故除零星解廠貨外、迄無大額之新成交、</p>
<h3>紗花　現銷不振　紗市難升</h3>
<p>紗市又入於盤旋之境、但外滙依然軟弱、人心未能隨之提升、實係現紗客銷不暢、投機商難以十分興奮也、然查其走勢、較爲平穩、深恐亦不致於有大變遷、根本問題、客銷太淸、目前之處境、逢漲稍出、遇低收進、比較爲便宜、</p>
<p>現紗晨開檯面乏勁、因十日午後滙票鬆弱、一部份浮多吐出幾包、於是搶帽子之輩乘勢而撳低、開盤　十支雙馬價爲一千零零五元、此價跟賣者殊鮮、市面又復徐徐回好、旋聞外滙帶緊、黃金昂貴、買氣轉濃、步步漲至一千零十五元、但收盤以後又見下挫、查半日間成交統計一千九百零五元、行情二十支雙馬跌二元半、昨有棉紗六百三十七件、運烟台、七百零五件運香港，今日尙有六百二十五件亦運香港、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>香港　一七〇同行一、四二〇</p>
<p>內地　二〇〇雲南　一〇〇</p>
<p>厦鬥　一五　統計　一、九〇五</p>
<h3>行廠相繼活動　棉市大見開展　行情亦帶好不少</h3>
<p>久已靜默之棉市、昨則外匯改縮、同行中互相買賣、又復活動、同時廠方因紗價安定、且多時未曾購辦、亦起添補之念、因之現棉成交、大見開展、行情隨之帶好、不過海外印美棉市狀况、仍在疲境中、今日有棉花一百件運香港、茲將現棉成交情形列左、</p>
<p>白洛去　二〇四·〇〇新裕進　二〇〇件</p>
<p>巴西棉</p>
<p>二二九·五〇日華進一、五〇〇件</p>
<p>杜力拉　一〇〇·〇〇　又　二〇〇件</p>
<p>大中集　三〇·五〇新裕進一、五〇〇件</p>
<p>通打包　一八六·〇〇　又　三〇〇包</p>
<p>辛享　一九〇·〇〇申新進　一〇〇件</p>
<p>細絨包　二〇七·〇〇　又　二〇〇件</p>
<p>彭家浦　二二六·五〇　又　一〇〇件</p>
<p>火機草　火機一五九·〇〇大康進　二〇〇包</p>
<p>通打包　一八一·五〇　又　二〇〇包</p>
<p>NT二二六·〇〇日華進　三〇〇件</p>
<p>以上廠方成交均現貨送廠</p>
<p>火草包　一五二·〇〇三一進　六七包</p>
<p>火打包　一五九·〇〇　又三〇包</p>
<p>通州　二〇·〇〇　又　一四包</p>
<p>平果爾　一三八·〇〇　又一〇〇件</p>
<p>通州一六八·五〇　元誠進一〇七件</p>
<p>通打包　一七一·五〇　三一進二三〇件</p>
<p>米特林　四〇·〇〇同業進一〇〇件</p>
<p>火機　一八五·〇〇　又　一三〇包</p>
<p>以上同行成交棧交</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、市况疲乏、現貨交易異常淸淡、華爾街股票軟弱、結果收盤價格較之上日跌落三磅音、印度連同預測漲一羅比餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日頗呈熱鬧之狀、但俱爲日方廠商之放銀期交易、爲數的有千餘包之數、然華廠方面則交易仍然靜寂異常也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　布廠復工　専視外匯為進退　不注重供求盈虛</h3>
<p>國布　昨市先跌繼漲、形勢平穩、蓋以布銷略見好轉後、停工各布廠漸决恢復、而實銷仍殊平庸、囤戶心思視外滙爲進退目標、對於供求盈虛狀况反疏於置慮、昨售價仍有二角半至五角盤旋、結果較上日頗少軒輊、客銷平常、浙東各幫辦粗布色布一百餘件、閩粵幫辦色布色斜一百十件、烟台幫辦粗布綫呢近百件、本街囤戶進意轉淡批發號購辦二百餘件、午後染廠吸收坯布三百餘件、</p>
<p>東布　白貨龍頭細布、晨盤殊軟、嗣以同業心思堅穩、續有吸納、至午收盤回升至三十二元一角半、後市津幫與烟台幫搜辦龍頭成交三百餘包、市盤乃逐步拉高、售見三十二元七角半、惟收盤時又稍回挫、龍頭細布爲三十二元六角半、四君子嗶嘰九角四分、中檔細布細斜大致平定、</p>
<p>出口　棉布昨日有五百九十八件、運往烟台、又三百匹十五件、運往香港、四件運往天津、今（八日）有四百件、運往香港</p>
<h3>呢羢客銷有限</h3>
<p>羢客幫需銷、日來頗爲缺乏、內地幫因運輸受阻、兼滙水關係、及須抽征七五稅等、致十之七八無法停辦、淪陷區大半被日商所統制、如華北貨運、多數齊停、改由南京以貨易貨交易矣、致邇來內地及諸淪陷區大小各客幫、呢羢走銷受制而齊有限、前滬甬輪船通行時、一般客商、尙有輾轉設法做之、今則航行巴停、客銷範圍愈狹、呢羢銷路、此後完全獨靠木街孤島一隅矣、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲銷寂寥</h3>
<p>邇來紐約絲市、價平疲而交易甚淸、數日來交易所日僅做開十包、可謂空前寂寥、是故影響東洋絲價、近二十天來、橫濱絲價、現貨開一千三百五十元、半月餘迄未見升沉、蓋日本絲價下傾、政府當局撥款維持故也、故絲價前途很少望漲、本埠絲市、昨受外滙又縮之影響、英法洋行靜極思動、白廠七八分價四千八百八十五元、八一分四千九百五十元、八三分五千零五十元、僅成交五十担、而行盤則較日商高出二三百元云、茶葉昨日有二百零八件、運往香港、又一千一百二十五件、運往天津、</p>
<h3>雜糧　牛皮黃豆見新　採辦運輸證索費甚昂</h3>
<p>新黃豆除九江貨外、最先上市者當推常州牛皮黃、該豆在產地、聞已登塲二星期所以未見運滬、緣因採辦運輸證費用浩大、致未領出之故、昨日市塲中祗傳見小樣、該豆出品因今庚天時乾燥、身色均優越、年境亦豐稔、其成本在產區須三十四五元、（一百六十市斤計）、劃申加蔴袋運費等每担的合三十二三元、故販運商對於外費尙無把握、暫時不敢冒險搬運、昨市陳豆市氣稍呈軟勞、銷塲微細、祗本街交易蕪湖豆五十包、價詳市價欄、崇明沙黃四十餘包、及大連夾靑二十包而巳、</p>
<p>又豆子今日有一百五十五包運往香港、另有生油一千七百四十五聽、亦運香港、</p>
<h3>糖市　供不敷求　售價繼漲</h3>
<p>昨日糖市因美圓縮〇九三七五、兼之所供不敷所求、致先平後漲、的升數角至一元不等、二四粗白本棧貨七十元〇五角、下午七十一元、外棧貨七十元、七十元〇五角、七十一元、轉口貨八月十五日打單五十五元三角、八月二十二日打單五上五元五角、太古B嘜七十三元、七十三元二角、七十三元五角、DY東棧七十元〇四角、HX西棧六十九元七角、荷棉白七十一元、荷赤五十七元、五十七元五角、本廠雪白七十元〇五角至七十一元、</p>
<p>昨日由嗬囒來糖二千四百噸、又由海口運來七百六十六包、又三百五十九箱、</p>
<h3>煤炭　煤球續加八元　每担七元二角</h3>
<p>煤球行情、日昨廠方以匯市緊縮、成本抬高爲詞、同業廠盤、續加八元、計開南洋義泰興國華煤球自車每噸一百三十二元、送到另加車力、本街門莊、每担（一百市斤）概售七元二角、照前週又加四解云、</p>
<h3>雜項　洋燭天熱銷滯</h3>
<p>洋燭市况、因　外滙　　、原料成本高漲、致行盤步騰、同業紛紛囤糧、現以氣候關係、銷路呆滯、洋燭　價市上存貨充斥、一時難易脫手、最近售價船牌十八元無派司、鷄牌十七元六角、其他雜牌十六元、銷路淸淡、大致中秋後可望轉機、（增）</p>
<h3>南北貨　龍口粉回漲十五元</h3>
<p>綫粉　前以去肖少動、龍口粉曾由一百十餘元降至一百元、近由專做某等三行成立、團結不再放盤、價乃立緊、已升至一百十五元、靑島粉亦開升一元爲八十一元、</p>
<h3>五金　鐵品遭雨阻</h3>
<p>昨日傾盆大雨、五金交易莫不受其重大影響、各種鐵品均不能出門、市象蕭條、人心萎靡、當可想而知、查二百磅美會司鐵仍喊一百六十元、一百八十磅美馬口鐵依然售二百四十元、二百磅又價爲二百六十元、竹節鋼條每噸須一千一百五十元、本廠元釘喊四十五元、新盤元沽四十五元、新鉛絲沽八十五元、白鉛絲售七十元、黑鐵皮價在七十五兀左右、坯子貨每二千磅售一千元光景、美條鐵行情每箱在一百三四十元間、均有價而無銷路耳、</p>
<p>鋼鐵由美來滬、係美國總公司經理之Tampa號輪裝來、於上星期六到埠、停靠虹口華順碼頭起卸、計鋼條·鋼板·鐵塊及白鐵等共的五千噸之鉅、聞今日尙有大量到滬、</p>
<p>又角鐵昨日由香港來八百六十六塊、</p>

<p>據本埠南市黃浦江中停泊之船中人來言，近來數夜內，每至十一點鐘起，忽然人聲喧嘩，互根呼喊，如是至天明，或二次或三次，甚至開槍助威。究其原因，據謂船中人屆時皆見黑氣一團，隨風而來，似泰山傾倒，竟將在船安睡之人捲去，或云某船捲去三人，或云某船捲去二人，但均無實在姓名可指。因之人心惶惶，不能安枕。現南市各商民，咸相傳說；惟此項訛言，智者未敢輕信也。</p>

<p>西人量喜古器，其羅馬忌司兩國文物，聲明爲他國先，今在該境掘地，多獲古物，人甚寶之！近聞有人於葉沙里克地中，掘出一瓶，上有古字，人咸不識，中國署駐德欽使李觀察鳳苞，謂此係華字，其文所記年號，係在三千年前，註明瓶中可裝紗三疋云云。西人皆甚欣喜，謂忌司當日已同中國來往，此瓶係向中國購取者也。然或有人疑此瓶，並非中國運來，安知當日中西文之不同乎，語亦近理。</p>

<h3>新世界怎會來臨？</h3>
<p>上次我們在本報提到「我們需要一個新世界」。又說這新世界的實現，是要人人對於罪一惡，有澈底的覺悟，有除惡務盡的決心。</p>
<p>第一我們先說人類對於罪惡怎能有澈底的覺悟？其實這一點，並不成問題。因爲孟子曾經說過「是非之心，人皆有之」。人旣有是非之心，自然知道甚麼事是善，甚麼事是惡，甚麼事合乎天理，甚麼事不近人情，還有甚麼覺悟不覺悟呢？可惜人們爲了種種原因，或是驕傲，或是自私，或是偏見，往往埋沒天良，老着臉，硬着心，執迷不悟，一意孤行，至於他所說的那向話，或所做的那件事，別人要受到多大的損害，他却完全不管。一家之中，有了這樣的人，那家就不會平安。一國之中有了這樣執政掌權的，非但那一國不會平安，而且要損害到別的國家。人類甚麼時候都能接受上帝所給與他那天良的指導，革面洗心，成爲新人，甚麼時候就是新世界的來臨。</p>
<p>第二我們應當知道人有人的軟弱，有時對於罪惡，淸夜捫心，未嘗沒有覺悟，但却沒有去罪的能力。例如一個吸鴉片的人，你若和他談起鴉片的害處來，恐怕他所知道的，比你還要多，但一提起」戒絕一兩個宇，他就要「顧左右而言他」了，這是爲甚麼？這就是人的弱點！基督教有一位聖人曾經爲自己的軟弱歎息說：「立志爲善由得我，只是行出來由不得我。」（羅七18）後來他在另一個時候又說：「我靠着那加給我力量的，凡事都能作」。（腓四13）親愛的讀者，我們要人類變新，要世界變新，先要從你自己新起，惟有耶穌能給你新的力量，你信嗎？（八月十一日再登）</p>

<p>特寫</p>
<h3>地洞醫院</h3>
<p>— 翁樵</p>
<p>陝西西安郊外的二十三個地洞，就是這城市中最新式的醫院。這些地洞是在一個道廟後面的廣塲上，那兒栽着整齊的草木及由根分莖的灌木，給了這醫院一個可愛的花園，而且那三十呎深的地洞，予轟炸中的病人及設備的最大安全。</p>
<p>國立衛生處西北特別衛生委員會所設的西北醫院，當然有牠謹愼的原因。西安距黃河前綫僅百六十公里，而且曾有過好幾次日機的光顧。在三月幾次轟炸中，陝西省會裏一個有悠久的歷史的教會機關——燕瓊及拉勃遜醫院曾經被轟炸過兩次。結果，炸毀了外科手術室及臨診教授室。後來這醫院就遷到城外一個教會學校裏，這醫院就設在地洞下，以免再遭受同樣的命運。</p>
<p>這醫院每年預算計十三萬元。在西安有門診部和十三個病房，牠們都在地洞裏，病房裏設有一百個病床，還有其餘十個地洞是用作臨診教授室及職員宿舍。新的病房，在需要的時候，短時期內就可以開始建築。</p>
<p>這個醫院分作內科，外科，眼科，耳鼻咽喉科孩童科及接生科六部。這兒有二十一個經過檢定的醫生。就中有幾個是美國或英國的留學生。此外還有三十四個受過訓練的女看護。</p>
<p>這醫院在一九三九年九月就開始爲社會服務。在頭三月半裏統計受過醫治的病人有一四九八九人。自今年起門診部每日總有五百個病人。</p>
<p>在院裏病人是完全免費的，僅有的費用就是那兩毛錢的藥瓶儲存費。地洞裏的病房很乾燥，而且有很好的透氣。天氣允許的話，病人還可以到花園裏享受更多的陽光及大自然之美。</p>
<p>外科手術室是設在廟宇的大廳裏。來院割治者大數是沙眼患者。</p>
<p>這個醫院把牠注意力完全放在平民上面，因爲在西安附近有很多看顧傷兵的軍事醫院。</p>
<p>自然</p>
<h3>島的配偶</h3>
<p>— 鹄</p>
<p>偶然從雜誌上看到這樣的記載：</p>
<p>圭亞那地方，有一種名叫Tinamau的鳥，雌的在產了一個卵以後，便飛向遠方去：把孵卵的責任交給雄的担負。往往在第一隻小鳥羽毛未健的時候，雌的又從遠方飛回產下另一個卵，使得做父親的不得不肩起孵卵與育兒雙重的責任，而母親却翱翔於曠野，度此優哉遊哉的生活。</p>
<p>相反地，在歐洲有一種名叫Hornbill的鳥，雌的在產卵以後，便被囚禁在一隻泥築的巢中，僅留一極小的孔，以便得到雄鳥所施捨的食物；一點自由都沒有。</p>
<p>這是我憑着記憶寫下來的，原文當然與這有些出入，不過內容却自信沒有歪曲。至於我爲甚麼能够記得淸楚的原因，是當時覺得這兩種各處極端的鳥，似乎對於我們人類含有一點教育的意味：因此還把這記載說給朋友聽，引起了朋友一番滔滔的議論。</p>
<p>在封建社會下，女子的地位向來是低落的，她們的確像被男人們「囚禁」在屋子裏；除了管理家務以外，一切社交都沒有。可是自從歐風東漸以後，一部份的女子不但被解放了，她們的地位甚至還超過了男子，將一切家庭的資任交給丈夫管理，自己却專門跳舞看電影，甚至還與別人戀愛。就像前面所說的Tinamau樣，專門在外面遊蕩，與旁的鳥所共同孕育的蛋，也得讓自己的丈夫去孵化去養育。這一些現象都有過與不及之弊。</p>
<p>頂理想的夫婦應該是站在互助的立塲上的，旣不像Hornbill樣特別限制女性的活動，也不像Tinamau樣將責任完全委託給男子。他門應該像燕子般，各盡自己的能力，各以自己的特長擔負起分內的責任。</p>
<h3>自由</h3>
<p>— 森年</p>
<p>自由是什麼？它包含兩點：（一）明白自己行動的範圍而遵守之，須承認自己有獨立人格，不要懼怕，妒忌，厭惡。（二）須明瞭自己所處的環境，亦不必懼怕，妒忌，厭惡。當你如此做時，你得着自由了。——Ann　Bridge</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第四章　幾種推想</p>
<p>那茶房又滿面笑容，半推半受地說：「先生，你太客氣了。」實際上那張法幣早已安然地過了渡。「先生，這錢先生到底幹了什麼事？」</p>
<p>霍桑低聲說：「他也許殺了人！」他說時定一定神，似在傾聽什麼，又向甬道西口望了一望。</p>
<p>「殺了人？」那侍役禁不住流露出驚駭狀來。</p>
<p>霍桑止住他說：「輕聲些！你可以通知你的同事們，如果在什麼地方再瞧見他，或是有什麼人來找他，你就應差一個人悄悄地跟着去。你如果能把他或他的朋友的住所報吿我，我準備着十張同樣的法幣酬謝你。」他說着掏出一張卡片來給他。「這裏有我的電話號數，你留着。</p>
<p>那茶房一瞧見卡片，臉上忽現出驚訝的神氣。「唉，你是霍桑先生——我——我一定照辦——不過再要瞧見他，也許不大容易。」</p>
<p>雷桑點頭道：「那不妨事，我還有別的法子找他。你祇盡你的力好了。」他說完了向我點點頭，回身就走。</p>
<p>我跟着霍桑回到電梯間面前。那梯間的鋼門關着，上面的指示針正停留在樓下的第一層。我料想要等這電梯上升到頂，然後再降下來，還需要相當的時間。因爲這案子的逐步開展，我委實有些按耐不住，便想利用這等候的機會，聽聽霍桑的見解。　（六九）</p>

<h3>靈魂的呼聲</h3>
<p>— 品品</p>
<p>一個人在人生的路上行走常要回頭的，幾乎越向前走一步，總得回頭一次。過去並沒有特別使人戀戀不忘的地方，但一天一天挨近老，對於靑春的消失自然引起惆悵，於是越發覺得過去的可愛。</p>
<p>我可以說快走到人生的半程。走路慢了，記性逐漸消退，頭髮不及過去那樣濃厚，眼睛很少閃出光彩，談話亦像常人一樣平凡。我覺得孤單，因爲可親的年輕朋友與我疏遠，換來一批沒有光沒有熱的陌生人。我在徘徊，前面的路似乎塞了。我問自己：「難道我這一輩子就完了，像夏末的蟬？」</p>
<p>在動的時候，我可以忘了自己，可是一靜下來——譬如說，早醒的早晨，工作之後的休息——我可禁不住盤問自己「失了些東西了！」我默思，再默思，究竟發現了這個失去的東西。靑年的野心已失了！</p>
<p>在過去的許多時候，我發過幾百次的誓，參加過不算多也不算少的活動，跟人做了忘了次數的競爭，弄得口舌乾燥去同我的反對者辯論，經常地笑……現在呢？不發誓，像愚笨的牛，退縮了，老馬一般地退縮了，不高興競爭，說牠　有意義，辯論的能力不知逃到那裏去；笑呢，牠的方法也失了，唯有愁。</p>
<p>失了野心的我，於是非常驚慌，像後面有獵鷹追來的　鵲。</p>
<p>靑年的野心是必要的，加使牠帶來了錯誤或失敗，要是沒有牠，人生在冬天裏。雖然我的靑年時代的努力不把歡快遞給我，但失了牠，我已沒有份兒去求歡快。現在除了回頭顧盼外，我能做什麼？</p>
<p>突然，靈魂向我說：「復活牠！保存牠，」我覺得精神一振，當聽了靈魂的呼聲之後。與我同路的人呀，你不必　慌，靑年的野心還有一點火　，只待一撥！</p>

<p>梨園史料</p>
<h3>關於譚鑫培之詩</h3>
<p>— 梅花館主</p>
<p>飲冰窒主梁任公寓舊都時，與梨園中人亦時多往還，嘗題譚鑫培扮漁翁繡像詩一首，當時頗爲都人士所傳誦。愚於民九秋首次赴平，會見此像此詩，懸於英秀堂之西側室，詩後並有羅癭公之跋語，以後再去，卽　復見此像之存留矣。詩係七古，愚有抄本，詩云：「四海一人譚鑫培，聲名卅紀轟如雷，如今老矣偶玩世，尚有俊饗吹塵埃；藝雨蒲風晚來急，五湖深處寄烟笠，何限人間貿繡人，枉向塲中費歌泣。」</p>
<p>吾家海藏樓主太夷，中年時亦好與伶工遊，贈伶之詩，以雙淸館主金月梅所得爲最多，王靈珠周信芳二人，亦頗有所獲，然皆不入集中。集中所偶見者，有贈譚英秀七律一章，題曰「觀小叫天演碰碑」，頗鏗鏘可誦，固不能因人而廢也，乃並錄之。</p>
<p>「暮年楊業竟與尸，雲代威名自一時；敵破何殊逐雉兔，望風曾說避旌旗；晚途供奉成遺老，垂死英雄有駿姿，霜月滿犬冰作涕，暗嗚猶繞李陵碑。」</p>
<p>按此詩命意，偏重劇情，其五六「晚途供奉成遺老，垂死英雄有駿姿，」二句，一則寫演劇者在伶界之地位，一則寫劇中人在臺上之神態；末二句則　寫此劇聲情之妙，演唱之工，將演劇者與劇中人併爲一談，亦足見譚氏摹擬楊業聲容之深入化境矣。</p>
<p>日前閱析津名作家娛園老人所撰梨園別紀一文，內載「同光間名伶名劇雜詠」多首，其中一首，卽詠譚氏之狀元譜者，詩云：</p>
<p>詠譚金福（卽小叫天）狀</p>
<p>元譜（佚名）</p>
<p>「膝下凋零甚，衰年屢蹙容，業嗟猶子失，生嘆不逢辰，乞相懸鶉苦，閒情唱雉庸，巡簷哀吿語，舉杖怒塡胸，彼岸回頭急，先塋灑淚濃，感時供薄享，遺跡在崇封，重付資財掌，須將教訓從，一朝遷善速，鵰路　飛衝。」（梅按：此係詠劇詩，與英秀絲毫無涉。）</p>
<p>原註云：譚金福藝名鑫培，其父唱老旦，聲似叫天子鳥，故綽號「叫天子」，英秀號「小叫天」，卽以此故，迨英秀晚年，稱之者不忍言小，乃簡曰「叫天兒」，金福乃其某一時期之別名也。</p>
<h3>德國的電影閃電戰術</h3>
<p>— 華志</p>
<p>德軍以迅雷不及掩耳的手段，囊括了歐洲諸小國，舉世對於她的閃電戰術」，無不爲之震驚；然而德國的閃電方式，不僅在軍事上，卽在文化電影各方面亦然。</p>
<p>原來美國影片在歐洲各小國覇佔廣大的市塲，德國影片業，早視爲眼中之釘，然又無法和它競爭，便竭力隱忍，等待良機。數月前常德軍進攻丹麥，直入丹麥京城哥本哈琴的當夜，立刻發出了一道命令，着全城所有的影戲院，一律開映德國出產的影片，以示慶祝，各影院老闆時都十分慌張，因爲他們手邊只有美國片子，那來的德國片子呢。</p>
<p>正在這當兒，忽然發現許多德國影片商，笑喀嘻地出現了，他們帶着大批新製的德國拷貝，一一分發給各家影院，老闆們都覺得非常詫異。事實上在德軍未進丹京的前一天，德國的「電影第五縱隊」，早就得到丹京當於某時某刻陷落的消息，預先携了大批影片，混進城內，從容佈置，等到號令一下，便實行控制一切。這個方法在佔據捷克時，也一度用過。可憐的是美國影片，就在一夜功夫裏，被擯於丹麥境外，丹麥靑年男女最熱戀的明星如克拉蓋博爾，埃洛爾茀林，狄安娜寳萍之流，也從此和他們訣別，眼睛裏換了一羣不甚歡迎的陌生面孔了。</p>

<h3>怎樣攝製電影？（七）</h3>
<p>— 德綱</p>
<p>（七）有聲片看無聲片時，但見人的嘴脣掀動，而聽不見他所說的話，這當然是件很大的缺憾。爲消滅這缺憾，科學家們便發明了有聲片，把聲音帶上了銀幕，使觀衆們不但有看，並且還有聽。攝製聲片的方法，有的是在攝戲待把各種聲昔如淡話，樂聲，歌唱等，一併用留聲機錄下，而後在放映影片時，用擴音器將錄下聲音放出便成。這裏有一個困難，就是難使動作和聲音恰巧同時舉行，爲解決這困難，有人發明利用兩隻電力小馬達，一隻管影，一隻管聲，兩隻馬達都經特殊裝製，使行動成爲一致，如此影和聲便能同時發出，永遠不會有參差的弊病了。除此之外，尙有一種最新式的有聲電影，映像的軟片，同時間還附有發聲的聲痕。聲痕的顏色，濃淡不一，恰和聲音相符合，在放映時强光通過聲痕，達於一電眼上，因光有强弱，故電眼生電波，再使作用於揚聲器上，便發聲音，這種有聲電影原理，比較複雜，非本文所能詳述。　（）</p>

<h3>Over Sixty Japanese Warships in Taiwan Suddenly Sail Towards the South China Sea: Chinese Sources Believe it is a Threat to Hong Kong; US Ambassador Visits Matsuoka to Inquire About French-Japanese Negotiations</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Well-informed Chinese sources recently stated that over sixty Japanese warships anchored off the coast of Taiwan have been ordered to sail towards the South China Sea. It is believed this movement of Japanese warships is a threat to Hong Kong. Furthermore, the Japanese military authorities are reportedly conscripting Chinese people in Guangzhou, with 7,000 having been conscripted since the end of July. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Manila - This morning, American naval sources stated that a large group of Japanese warships sailed south from Taiwan today. It is unknown whether the Japanese warships are sailing to French Indochina or Palau Island, but American naval sources believe the destination of the Japanese warships is Palau Island (Note: This island was formerly German-owned, but is now under Japanese trusteeship. It is located east of the Philippines, with an area of 175 square miles and a population of 5,000). (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - Passengers arriving in Hong Kong from Shanghai today stated that they saw Japanese transport ships and warships engaged in large-scale activities south of Taiwan. They witnessed a fleet of eighteen transport ships sailing south from Taiwan. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>London - The London Daily Express received news from Hong Kong that eighteen Japanese transport ships, closely guarded, were seen sailing south from Taiwan, possibly heading to Vietnam. However, this news has not yet been confirmed. Furthermore, the Daily Mail received news from the French-Spanish border that France is determined to resist if Vietnam is attacked. Generally, people here believe that since Tokyo may again request naval bases, France and Japan may engage in naval combat in Vietnam. Although the French military strength in Vietnam is insufficient to resist large-scale invasions, it is generally expected that the French residents there will not willingly surrender. The Governor-General of Vietnam, Vice Admiral Decoux, insists that all Japanese demands must be negotiated with the Vichy government. Many observers believe that the Governor-General's strong stance is of great significance. However, the Japanese ambassador to Vietnam has been treated with exceptional deference and has completed extensive military and economic surveys of the colony. (International News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry stated while addressing reporters that rumors that Japan and France are negotiating to obtain army and navy bases within French Indochina are completely untrue. (Haitong Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>Japan Denies Making Demands on Vietnam; Ambassador Gu Inquires with France About the True Situation</p>
<p>Tokyo - The United States Ambassador to Japan, Joseph Grew, met with Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka this afternoon to inquire about rumors that Japan and France are currently engaged in negotiations regarding Vietnam. According to semi-official Japanese sources, the Foreign Minister replied that the rumors mentioned are not true. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Vichy - The Chinese Ambassador to France, Gu Weijun, recently visited the French Foreign Minister Paul Baudouin and the Minister of Colonies, René Lémery, to discuss the political and economic negotiations between France and Japan and Japan's request for military bases in Vietnam. It is reported that Ambassador Gu requested the two ministers to provide information on Japan's request to use Vietnam as a base and the increased exchange of raw materials and manufactured goods between Japan and Vietnam. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - According to reliable Japanese sources arriving here from Hanoi, the negotiations in Hanoi are becoming increasingly difficult. Although the source is very skeptical about whether Japan has made a request to France to establish bases in Vietnam (according to Vichy sources, the negotiations are underway), it admits that Japan's demands on Vietnam may become stronger. During the absence of the Japanese inspector-in-chief, Nishihara, who has returned to Japan, his deputy is Sato. Sato is a member of the Japanese military and is a leader of the Japanese army in southern China stationed in Guangzhou, and was formerly the spokesperson for the Japanese army in Tokyo. This Japanese reporter stated that Sato is currently working hard to obtain the cooperation of the French side to end the Sino-Japanese War and said that his requests include allowing the transport of Japanese troops from Haiphong along the railway to the Vietnamese border and the establishment of Japanese supply depots on the Vietnamese coast. The source also said that the Japanese may intend to intercept existing Chinese military supplies in the Haiphong warehouses. These Chinese military supplies include American vehicles, rubber tires, machinery, gasoline, etc., for which payment has already been made by China. It is reported that the value of these stocks is eight million US dollars. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Yomiuri Shimbun reported that Colonel Sato, a key Japanese official stationed in French Indochina, has been ordered to negotiate with the French authorities to extend the effective period of the order prohibiting the transport of military supplies across the border to General Chiang Kai-shek. The original order is scheduled to expire on August 6th. (Haitong Agency, 7th)</p>
<h3>Three American Newspapers Publish Articles Condemning Japan's Southern Advance</h3>
<p>New York - Three major morning newspapers here have recently published articles stating that Japan, unable to conquer China, has consequently developed a new policy and is attempting to expand southward. The New York Times stated that both sides of the world's aggressors are taking joint steps that will leave us with no room for choice or discussion. The New York Post stated that Western reaction and Eastern barbarism are two sides of the same coin, and the recent blockade by the administration is a way to correct this phenomenon. The New York Mirror stated that Japan openly said it would obtain oil and iron from the Dutch East Indies, but Secretary of State Hull responded with "get out of here." (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Longzhou Invade West Towards Xia Dong Unsuccessfully; Intercepted Section by Section, Ultimately Defeated and Retreating; Chinese Troops Active on Both Sides of the Yongqin Road</h3>
<p>Liuzhou - The Japanese troops in Longzhou again invaded west towards Xia Dong. After the Japanese penetrated deeply, the Chinese troops intercepted them section by section, and on the afternoon of the 3rd, completely crushed the Japanese who invaded Xia Dong. (Telegram, 7th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Advancing South of Tongcheng Completely Defeated; Highway Near Baini Ju Destroyed; Chinese Troops Attacked and Entered Majiazhai</h3>
<p>Pingjiang - Japanese troops from Xishan, south of Tongcheng, advanced towards the Chinese on the morning of the 5th under the cover of several mountain guns. The Chinese attacked fiercely from multiple routes and engaged the Japanese in fierce fighting for three hours, completely defeating the Japanese troops. Afterwards, an inspection of the battlefield revealed over a hundred Japanese corpses, including two officers. Furthermore, between Chongyang and Xianning, a certain Chinese unit completely destroyed the Japanese highway traffic from Baini Bridge to Xinta Ridge on the evening of the 4th. (Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Yicheng - On the morning of the 3rd, Japanese troops from Dongsanshi in Yichang continuously shelled, attempting to advance towards the Chinese. After a fierce counterattack by the Chinese, one Japanese artillery piece was destroyed. (Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Xiangyang - Chinese troops who were mopping up the remaining Japanese troops in the Zilingpu South Bridgepu (both north of Jingmen) area encountered a unit of Japanese troops near South Bridgepu the day before yesterday. After two hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese left many corpses and fled in defeat. At the same time, another unit of Chinese troops launched a fierce attack on the Japanese in Majiazhai and captured the village in one fell swoop. (Telegram, 7th)</p>

<h3>Chinese Army Battle Results on the Eastern Bank of the Yellow River</h3>
<p>A certain area in western Sui - A person from Qingshui River said that last month, a small unit of soldiers from a certain Chinese unit was suddenly attacked by the Japanese on the eastern bank of the Yellow River. As the Chinese were outnumbered, they all lay down after the Japanese began firing. When the Japanese approached, they suddenly launched a fierce charge. As the Japanese reinforcements arrived, the Chinese soldiers, seeing that they were unable to win, bravely wrestled the Japanese soldiers into the river, dying together. (Telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Army in Northern Henan Destroys Railway Bridge</h3>
<p>Luoyang - Taking advantage of a heavy rain on the night of the 1st, the Chinese army in northern Henan, with a nimble maneuver, completely destroyed a railway bridge northeast of Xinxiang, and bombed the Japanese soldiers on the bridge, causing heavy losses to the Japanese. (Telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3>American Wireless Radio Company in Tianjin Will Be Forced to Cease Operations; American Chamber of Commerce Cables the State Department to Request Maintenance</h3>
<p>Tianjin - The Tianjin British Municipal Council recently notified the American Wireless Radio Company to cease operations starting August 20th. The American Wireless Radio Company has always communicated with Shanghai without being subject to inspection. The Tianjin British Municipal Council's action is apparently due to Japanese protests. The American Chamber of Commerce has now cabled the State Department in Washington to request that the wireless communication be maintained. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>Students from War Zones Register in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Chongqing - In order to guide students from the war zones in their studies and employment, the Ministry of Education specially established the War Zone Student Guidance Office in Chongqing in mid-July, divided into registration and guidance groups, to handle the registration and distribution of students from the war zones. In addition to establishing branch offices in Luoyang and Jinhua, it has also ordered the provincial education departments to handle the work locally.

<h3>The South China Sea Crisis and Vietnam</h3>
<p>While there are still no signs that Germany will launch a blitzkrieg against England, the situation in the South China Sea has been increasingly tense in recent days. It is said that negotiations between Japan and Vietnam on the establishment of military bases are underway, and the movement of the Japanese fleet in the South China Sea, which began in late July, has reached a serious level. On the surface, the most eye-catching event in the world recently is the mutual arrest of expatriates by England and Japan, but as long as the Japanese government does not change its current "wait-and-see attitude," this dispute may be temporarily resolved through easing. As for the crisis in the South Pacific, it seems to be growing. The complex situation and various weaknesses in that area may not be able to mount a strong and effective resistance to aggression under the current circumstances, which is why Japan openly includes Vietnam, the Dutch East Indies, and even the islands of India, Burma, and the Philippines within its "New Order." If the Anglo-German war enters a stage of close combat, it will be a good time for the Far Eastern aggressors to realize their southern ambitions.</p>
<p>Among the many units in Southeast Asia, the one most coveted by Japan is naturally the Dutch East Indies, and the most pressing crisis is Vietnam. Although the economic resources of Vietnam are also considerable, they are ultimately inferior to those of the Dutch East Indies. However, its strategic value is higher than that of the Dutch East Indies, because to implement the southward advance, the land and coast of Vietnam are the most important military strongholds. Even taking China's Hainan Island as an example, it seems to command the entire South China Sea, but without a strong naval base on the west coast of the South China Sea, the battle for that area will be doubly difficult. Therefore, the importance of the South Island is actually inferior to that of Vietnam. Moreover, since the South China Sea islands have been occupied by Japan one after another, and the Yonglong area, which is secretly connected to the northern border of Vietnam, has been harassed, Vietnam, although important, already seems to be under remote control. Therefore, Japan can use the close proximity of Chinese and Vietnamese territory to carry out its dual-purpose method under the slogan of "resolving the China Incident." It not only gains the convenience of attacking the southwest rear of China, but also conceals its ambition to invade southward, unlike the Dutch East Indies, which has the great concern of the United Kingdom and the United States, and is far separated from the Japanese army's rear. In this way, it is no wonder that it is only negotiating and investigating the Dutch East Indies, while it is already wielding a knife and testing France and Vietnam.</p>
<p>If the world wants to truly understand the South China Sea crisis, it must first dispel the confusion of various smokescreens. For the past three years, Japan's offensive against third countries has almost always used slogans such as "resolving the China Incident" as a pretext to coerce them into making concessions. Various countries have been misled by this, and China has suffered limited harm, while third countries have suffered endless damage. There are almost countless examples of this. Taking the Vietnamese authorities' promise to ban Japanese embargo demands as an example, according to a Reuters news report on the 6th, Japan has used this right to engage in activities that go beyond the scope, and even demanded the establishment of naval bases in Vietnam. This not only violates French sovereignty, but is also difficult to explain as meeting the military needs of China, which has no navy at all. However, this kind of smokescreen diplomacy has repeatedly deceived the world in the past, and even deceived the authorities of the great powers, making them abandon justice and fairness, and even legal principles, in order to cater to the intentions of the aggressors. These great powers' lack of vigilance and foresight is an important reason for the recent crisis in the South Pacific. It is worth remembering that when the Japanese army invaded and occupied Hainan Island last spring, the highest authority in China pointed out that it was the "September 18th Incident" of the Pacific Ocean. Unfortunately, that warning did not cause due reaction in the international community, and there was no effective prevention to remove the stovepipes and change the firewood early. The recent British measure to block the滇缅 Road was defended on the grounds that the United Kingdom was engaged in a war of life and death, and the submission of the French and Vietnamese authorities to Japanese demands was because they were seeking peace after a defeat, so they had no power to resist. As for these, let us not argue about them. However, before this kind of bad luck came, why did they never consider the future crisis in the Far East and make plans early? This cannot but be diagnosed with the current authorities of some great powers, who are accustomed to seeking ease and lack long-term vision and upright courage.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters report from Vichy, the French attitude towards Japan has become stronger and they are determined to resist any attack on Vietnam, and are also preparing in military terms. This news is truly like hearing the sound of footsteps in an empty valley. The Franco-German peace treaty allowed France to retain a considerable navy to protect its colonies, but the defensive strength of Vietnam is still pitifully weak. The Japanese are even extremely arrogant, saying that they can conquer it with just one division. Therefore, even if the French have determination, it is difficult to achieve effective self-defense without taking prompt measures. In fact, France has been held hostage by Germany and Italy in Europe, but it still has freedom of action in the Far East. First, it is important to recognize that the so-called strengthening of ties between Germany and Italy is only a one-sided fantasy of Japan. Germany and Italy will not only not encourage Japan's attempt to seize French colonies, but will rather be jealous of it. The French and Vietnamese authorities should recognize this contradiction in order to strengthen Vietnam's military strength. Second, the United Kingdom and France still have the same interests and positions in the Far East. In times of emergency, they should abandon their grievances and work together to devise effective measures based on the principle of joint defense. They should also engage in active contact and use with other countries with significant interests in the Far East, such as the United States. Third, it is important to recognize that China's resistance has always been an important factor in stabilizing the Far East. For example, the recent tightening of the deployment of the Chinese army on the Vietnamese border in Guangxi and Guizhou, and the counterattacks in the Longzhou Shuikou Funan area are not only to consolidate China's rear, but also to reduce the pressure on Vietnam. The French and Vietnamese authorities should not only not continue to take measures that harm China's war of resistance, but should also maintain close contact with it and work together to ensure the safety of the South Asian continent. Historically, China and Vietnam have had blood relations, and in reality, China and Vietnam have inseparable interests.</p>
<p>The defeat in Europe has put France in a tragic abyss, but if it can succeed in protecting Vietnam in the Far East through strong and correct use, it will inevitably form the cornerstone of France's revival. I hope to give this intention to the current French and Vietnamese authorities.</p>
<h3>Incident of Arresting Overseas Chinese; Japan Declares its Position to the UK; Awaits the UK's Response Before Taking Action; Singapore Intensifies Military Preparedness</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Foreign Minister Matsuoka told the cabinet yesterday that the Japanese government had notified the British government of Japan's position on the "unreasonable" arrests of Japanese expatriates in the British Empire. The Japanese government is now awaiting the British response before taking action. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>London - A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy here said yesterday that although there have been "minor incidents and misunderstandings," "we are confident that this matter will be quickly resolved satisfactorily." He also said that "according to indications from all sides, relations between Japan and the United Kingdom will continue to improve." (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Singapore - The Japanese Consul General in Singapore, Toyota, visited the Acting Minister of Overseas Chinese Affairs yesterday to inquire about the arrest of Kobayashi, the manager of the Dongfang News Agency and a former correspondent for the Mengyou News Agency. The Acting Minister of Overseas Chinese Affairs told him that the authorities had detained Kobayashi in accordance with the Defense Ordinance. Kobayashi's residence had been searched. An advisory committee appointed by the Acting Governor, led by a judge, will investigate the case and make recommendations. At the same time, the authorities continue to intensify various military preparations and closely monitor the actions of residents. The authorities have ordered the expulsion of one Taiwanese employee hired by a Japanese trading company, who will leave the country on Friday. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Anti-British Movement Spreads Throughout Japan</p>
<p>Tokyo - Anti-British demonstrations in Japan are spreading throughout the country. The Greater Japan Youth Party is demanding that the Army Department take a firm attitude to deal with Britain. The External Affairs Department has also received the same request from various national groups. (Haitong Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese newspapers and semi-official organizations continue to demand that the authorities take strong action against Britain to ensure that all Japanese expatriates detained in the British Empire are released immediately. However, the Japanese government's wait-and-see attitude seems to be gradually taking effect. The release of Zhiyuan and the Japanese announcement that some ten British expatriates banned in Japan have been allowed to return to their residences seem to have eased the situation slightly, but it cannot be said that the tension has passed. Yesterday, various public organizations sent representatives to the British Embassy to present resolutions demanding the immediate release of the arrested Japanese expatriates, and threatened to take "severe measures" against Britain if this was not done. At the same time, newspapers continue to curse Britain with extremely venomous words. The general public is relatively calm about rumors that Japanese ships may not be allowed to dock in Hong Kong. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Tokyo City Council yesterday submitted a request to the British Ambassador to Japan, Clark, to respond to the British arrest of Japanese expatriates by asking Britain "not to act in the Far East." The City Council also asked the British Ambassador to urge the British government to quickly release "the illegally arrested Japanese expatriates." (Haitong Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Public outrage is growing in Japan over the British authorities' arrest of Japanese expatriates. Important members of the Tokyo City Council have gone to various cities to hold protest rallies. Yesterday, they also resolved to hold a mass demonstration on August 12, in which representatives from one hundred and twenty cities will participate. Japanese newspapers reported that tens of thousands of Japanese from various cities will come to Tokyo to hold demonstrations in front of the British Embassy and government offices. The Houchi Shimbun reported that Redman, the Far East Director of the British Intelligence Department, should be arrested, as he is the number one British spy stationed in Japan. Other staff members of the British spy agency should also be detained. (Haitong Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - According to "Japanese Temple Newspaper", several arrested British expatriates have been released from prison, but are still being held in their residences. (Haitong Agency, 7th)</p>
<h3>US Army and Air Force Conduct Large-Scale Exercises; Over 80,000 Participants; The St. Lawrence Seaway is the Hypothetical Target</h3>
<p>Ogdensburg - Over 80,000 regular and National Guard troops are concentrating here today to participate in military exercises in the upper half of New York State. The hypothetical battle is the "Battle of the St. Lawrence." As of last night, more than 6,000 officers and soldiers had arrived in the 1,300-square-mile area, and more than 10,000 others (mostly air force and air defense troops) will arrive by Saturday. At that time, Brigadier General Charles, the commander of the recently established Air Defense Command, will command the anti-aircraft defenses of the land forces. At the request of the Army, the US Defense Forces are conscripting 2,800 citizens in the 1,680-square-mile area to deploy in 347 volunteer "alert stations." At the same time, 46 state forest fire towers will be used as lookout towers to detect the movement of "enemy" aircraft in "wartime." When an "enemy" aircraft is discovered, the volunteer lookout will immediately notify the Air Defense Headquarters in Watertown by telephone. Operators in the headquarters, who are long-term employees, will face a map marked with the locations of the lookout towers. When the lookout issues a notice, he will state the type, number, speed, longitude, and direction of the aircraft, so that the command headquarters can intercept it. At least 162 aircraft will participate in the exercise, with the hypothetical target of occupying the St. Lawrence Seaway, as the area is traditionally the gateway to American industry. The attacking army will land in Boston and advance towards New York State to occupy the seaway. (Reuters, 7th)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Praises Pan-American Solidarity; Announces New Defense Plan; Plans to Form a Domestic Guard</h3>
<p>Hyde Park, New York - After having lunch here yesterday with representatives from four Latin American countries attending the Pan-American Conference, President Roosevelt told reporters that the spirit of Pan-American solidarity is now more of an established fact than ever before. The results of this conference are very interesting and can be said to be very successful. The president then answered a reporter's question and said that the sale of aviation fuel is limited to countries in the Western Hemisphere. This move can be said to be clear evidence that the Americas are now seeking to establish material and economic unity after spiritual unity. This restriction can also be seen as a comprehensive defense plan. The United States and other American countries are unable to supply aviation fuel to Europe and Asia due to national defense needs. (Reuters, 7th)</p>

<h3>Italian Troops Advance on British Somaliland in Three Routes; British Ground and Air Forces Mount a Strong Defense, Employing Camel Corps for Guerrilla Warfare</h3>
<p>Cairo – Italian troops today crossed the high mountains of British Somaliland, beginning their first large-scale land offensive, advancing towards the strongly resisting British forces in the Gulf of Aden. The three-pronged Italian offensive in Somaliland is progressing simultaneously with fierce fighting on the Egyptian-Libyan border. One Italian army is now advancing towards the Suez Canal using a pincer movement. British communiqués state that the Italian army is effectively turning East Africa and the Mediterranean into one large battlefield. The Italian offensive is clearly intended to advance towards the highway between Harar in eastern Abyssinia and Berbera, the capital of British Somaliland. The first-rate camel corps of British East Africa is currently resisting the Italian forces. (July 7th, International Dispatch)</p>
<p>Cairo – A communiqué issued here last night stated that enemy forces, since August 4th, have invaded British Somaliland Protectorate in three routes, attempting to seize Awdal and Hargeisa in two routes, with the third route advancing from Jirr towards Galagal. British land and air forces are jointly resisting, and although French Somaliland has collapsed, the British army is unaffected. No news is to be reported on other lines. According to London military circles, it appears that the three Italian routes are targeting the ports of Berbera and Zeila in the Gulf of Aden, but the roads between them are long, remote, and dangerous. The British forces opposing the Italian forces are the valiant Somaliland Camel Corps. The temperature in the area is constantly at 120 degrees Fahrenheit, and the Italian advance must cross mountains as high as 1,500 feet, with only camel paths available, so Italian forces may not be able to use mechanized units. British forces are expected to implement guerrilla warfare, and the British Air Force can inflict heavy damage on the slow-moving Italian forces. (July 7th, Reuters)</p>
<p>London – People here generally believe that the British Navy's strict surveillance has led Rome to decide to immediately launch a combined offensive from both Abyssinia and Libya. The Italian side has realized the difficulty of maintaining troops in this area, so it has decided to attack before the Italian overseas troops weaken due to the British blockade. Currently, although there are 250,000 Italian troops stationed in Libya, only a small number can truly fight. Advancing across a waterless desert requires an unusually large number of troops to maintain rear transportation lines. The shortening of British transportation lines has allowed a large number of troops to participate in the fighting. Therefore, the further the enemy advances, the stronger the British position will become. News of the Italian concentration on the Egyptian border has not alarmed the Egyptian people, because their trust in the British army has gradually increased since the start of the war. (July 7th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Nairobi – A communiqué issued here last night stated that a patrol sent out by the vanguard of the British army recently discovered a small squad of Italian irregular troops on the Bonajo Road. After a fierce battle, the enemy troops retreated in disarray, leaving behind one body and two wounded soldiers. Only one British non-commissioned officer was slightly injured. (July 7th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Initial Stage of Western Desert Warfare Concluded</p>
<p>Cairo – A bulletin released here last night stated that the first stage of the Western Desert war can now be considered over. During this period, a small British mobile force, with several armored vehicles and cannons, and several infantry companies, completely controlled the eastern area of the Italian Libyan colony's border. The number of Italian troops facing them across the border was numerous. Since Italy declared war, the number of Italian prisoners in the Libyan line alone has reached 808, including one general, with the loss of sixteen cannons, fifteen tanks, hundreds of casualties, and various military vehicles and materials. The British army achieved this victory due to the superior quality, well-trained and well-equipped desert army regiments, and the high morale of the British Air Force, which constantly attacked the enemy, and the constant patrols of the British Navy on the sea. The British army, navy, and air force are aware that the British side has a just cause, and they trust the outcome of the war, so the morale of all levels is high. This is in stark contrast to the hesitations and lack of confidence of the Italian army itself and the unfortunate people of Libya. Now the second stage has just begun, and how it will develop is not yet known. However, it is known that the enemy has gathered a large army in Al Naste in the Bardia area. Although the Italian manpower and material resources in the Capuzzo fort are gradually exhausted, they are still stubbornly defending it in order to protect the gathering Italian army. The new Governor of Libya, General Graziani, undoubtedly hopes to win a victory for propaganda purposes. However, judging from the evidence obtained in Gazala and Moyale, the Italian side needs ten times the number of British troops to dare to risk attacking the British positions. Now it is expected that the Italian army will eventually attack. If so, the British side is prepared and ready to strike a painful blow. (July 7th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Alexandria – Since the Italian army invaded British Somaliland in three routes, it is widely believed that the Italian attack on Egypt from Libya is imminent. However, there is no confirmation of the claim that Egyptian territory has been invaded. A semi-official communiqué released in Cairo today stated that everything is calm on the Egyptian border, and the only Italian troops currently in Egypt are one captured general and 808 officers and soldiers. According to officials here, the largest concentration of Italian troops on the northern border of Egypt is undoubtedly in the Barda area, numbering approximately two divisions. The rumor that 250,000 Italian troops have crossed the border has been strongly denied here. (July 7th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Haifa – Italian aircraft dropped bombs today, causing some damage and several casualties. The enemy aircraft were then driven away by anti-aircraft fire. (July 7th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Haifa – An Italian war report this afternoon stated that the Italian Air Force bombed oil tanks in the city of Haifa three times, with flames soaring into the sky, and the construction of the port of Haifa was also bombed. The Italian aircraft returned safely to their original positions. According to reliable sources, the first bombing of Haifa by the Italian army resulted in a fire that burned for several days. The enemy camps in North Africa south of Salon were also bombed. Italian destroyers shot down a British aircraft near Tobruk, and the eight personnel on board, including three officers, were captured. Italian aircraft attacked air force and naval bases in Aden and Berbera in East Africa. The Italian troops invading British Somaliland have crossed the border and are advancing.

<h3>German Announcement of British Ship Losses; Britain Calls It Exaggeration</h3>
<p>Berlin – Yesterday, the German military department released a war report stating that during the last three weeks of July, British merchant ships and non-British ships serving the British that were sunk by the German fleet exceeded 440,000 tons. Those sunk by German submarines amounted to 145,000 tons, and those sunk by the German Air Force totaled 215,000 tons, amounting to a total of 660,000 tons. On average, 220,000 tons were sunk per week. In fact, the enemy's losses were even greater, because 328,000 tons were heavily damaged and required long-term repairs before they could be used again. In addition, British ships sunk or damaged by the German Air Force totaled 50,000 tons. (July 7th, Reuter)</p>
<p>London – Responsible parties in London today criticized the German command's claim that the German side sunk 679,324 tons of British ships in the last three weeks of July, saying that Germany was again exaggerating by a factor of four. The accurate figures for the three weeks from July 7th to July 28th were a total loss of 196,219 tons for British, Allied, and neutral ships. Those lost to torpedoes, mines, or aerial attacks are included. The inaccuracy of German reported figures is not entirely intentional, as the German command's figures are based on the attacker's report, and the attacker often does not know the tonnage of the ships they attacked or the results they obtained.

<h3>Iraq and Afghanistan to Establish Diplomatic Relations; Move Expected to Stabilize Middle East Situation; India to Send Trade Commissioner to Australia</h3>
<p>Baghdad – Iraq will soon establish an embassy in the capital of Afghanistan and send a chargé d'affaires to be permanently stationed there. In 1937, Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, and Turkey signed a pact of non-aggression.

<p>London – According to Indian radio news, the Indian government has decided to appoint a trade commissioner to Australia, because since the outbreak of the European war, Indian goods worth no less than three million rupees annually have been excluded from the European market, so the Indian government has no choice but to open up new markets. Australia, due to exchange controls, cannot buy cotton cloth from Japan or rosin from the United States, so it must rely on India to supply its needs. (July 7th, Reuters)</p>

Undersecretary Butler replied that Foreign Secretary Halifax had recently instructed British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Cripps to seek a meeting with Soviet Overseas Trade Committee Chairman Zhirmunsky, because in the last meeting, the chairman had undertaken to notify the British government of the Soviet government's views as soon as possible. We hope that these negotiations will make progress, the sooner the better. He has read reports of Soviet trade negotiations with Iraq, Sweden, and Germany. Mr. Butler also assured Labour Member of Parliament Macklin that the government had fully informed Cripps of the type of agreement it intended to pursue and had a qualified trade advisor to assist Mr. Cripps. At this point, another member asked whether the government intended to send a trade delegation to Moscow.

<h3>Gu Xinan's Proposal to Merge Estonia - Soviet Supreme Soviet Passes Vote - Estonian Representatives About to be Elected</h3>
<p>Moscow: The fifth joint session of the two chambers of the Soviet Union was held last night at the Kremlin, discussing the Estonian parliamentary declaration. When the Estonian delegation entered the venue, the entire assembly stood up and cheered. The chairman of the Federal Council, Anduyev, introduced the members of the Estonian plenipotentiary delegation, led by Lauristin, to speak. In his moving speech, Lauristin described the high tide of enthusiasm among the Estonian people when choosing a new system of government. He stated that before the establishment of the Soviet government, the Estonian people groaned under the oppressive rule of the rulers. Estonia's policy of completely severing ties with the Soviet Union had resulted in the decline of Estonian agriculture and industry, factory closures, and a sharp increase in unemployment. People demanded jobs as if begging for food, and the standard of living for workers was lower than in any other European country. Farmers bore a heavy burden in taxes and fines, and countless lands were auctioned off annually. All of these things led the Estonian people to the brink of destruction. Therefore, when the Soviet Supreme Soviet passed the resolution to allow Estonia to join the Soviet Union, the Estonian people would surely be extremely pleased. The parliament, elected for the first time by the people, has followed the will of the people and freely resolved the life issues of the Estonian people. Finally, Lauristin exclaimed amidst cheers, "The Estonian people eagerly hope to unite with the Soviet Union and enjoy a life of freedom and joy. Only by merging into the Soviet Union can Estonia achieve independence and development." At this point, Lauristin formally requested the Supreme Soviet to merge Estonia into the Soviet Union. Subsequently, other members of the Estonian delegation delivered speeches, making the same unanimous request. Next, the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Karelo-Finnish Federal Republic, Xinan, addressed the assembly in Finnish. The deputies cheered for Gu for several minutes. Gu used the facts of his state to prove the victory of the Lenin and Stalin policies, and said that the hardworking Estonian people would soon achieve the same success. The Estonian merger bill was unanimously passed by a vote in both houses. The Soviet Supreme Soviet also decided that Estonia would elect representatives to attend the assembly. The date of the election will be determined by the Supreme Soviet. After the bill was passed, the entire assembly stood up and cheered for fifteen minutes, congratulating Stalin and his comrades. The cheers, mixed with Russian, Estonian, and Finnish, reverberated throughout the venue, proving the friendship and unity of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union. (TASS Telegraph, 7th)</p>
<h3>Pravda Commentary - Latvia's Merger with the Soviet Union Has International Significance</h3>
<p>Moscow: Pravda commented today, "Yesterday, the Soviet Supreme Soviet passed the bill to merge Latvia into the Soviet Union. The resolutions passed by the Supreme Soviet in the past few days all have significant international implications. People around the world have already understood the Soviet Union's way of handling the following facts: (1) National self-determination, (2) Allowing other countries to join the Soviet Republic on the principle of equality, (3) The strengthening of the Soviet regime. Latvia's merger with the Soviet Union is undoubtedly important because the Soviet Union and the Latvian people have fought together against Tsarist landlords and capitalists for many years. In the past twenty-two years, the Latvian people have been hoping for the red flag to fly high in the sky again, and they urgently sought the Soviet Union's assistance in overthrowing the oppression of small capitalists. This wish has now been realized. They will march forward on the Soviet path. Under the banner of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet Union has achieved great success in socialist construction in the past twenty years. Latvia can make use of this proven achievement to facilitate their work." (TASS Telegraph, 6th)</p>

<h3>Eight Estonian Ships Detained - Soviet Union Protests to Britain</h3>
<p>Stockholm: Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky protested to the British Foreign Office yesterday regarding the detention of eight Estonian ships by British authorities. The merchant ships were carrying a large quantity of goods to Soviet Russia. In addition, Britain has detained several Latvian merchant ships. Since the annexation of the three countries into the Soviet Union, the merchant ships have changed to fly the Soviet flag. British authorities refused to supply coal to the ships, preventing them from sailing. Foreign observers in London believe this move is a sign of deteriorating relations between Britain and the Soviet Union. According to well-informed sources, the Bank of England still refuses to transfer the accounts of the central banks of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania to the Soviet State Bank, with only private banks complying.

<h3>True Record of the European War (4) - The Retreat of the British and French Allied Forces</h3>
<p>In mid-May, the German army launched a fierce attack on Flanders. At that time, there were more than 300,000 British troops fighting in France. Supporting until the beginning of June, the Allied forces were unable to resist and had to find a way to cross the English Channel and retreat back to their country. Finally, under the fierce bombardment of German heavy artillery and aircraft, relying on their discipline and strong spirit, with more than a thousand warships, transport ships, and various vessels, they created an unprecedented great retreat amidst bad weather and stormy waves. They lost 30,000 troops, 1,000 artillery pieces, and countless supplies. From a military perspective, this retreat, although successful, cannot be considered a victory. However, from another perspective, the German army put in a great deal of effort, trying to catch everything in one go, but in the end, only managed to let the enemy "retreat with all their forces," which would naturally be disappointing. This article is Sergeant Jack Wadsworth of the British Midland Regiment's firsthand account of twenty-one days of combat. He served as the rearguard and retreated from Dunkirk. The original text is translated as follows.</p>
<p>Our army had been stationed in the western corner of France for half a month, unable to see English newspapers, feeling somewhat isolated from the world. Fortunately, there was someone in the camp with a radio, occasionally listening to outside news. On Sunday, we learned from the radio that the German army had begun to invade the Netherlands and Belgium.</p>
<p>After receiving this news, everyone was visibly delighted. The brothers all said, "The time has come, we can strike a blow at the German army." At this critical moment, our army was "ready for battle."</p>
<p>The last day in this camp was a scorching and lovely day. That afternoon, there was no exercise, so I went out for a walk with a brother. Passing through French village alleys, farmers were tilling the land. We went to a coffee shop in the village, drank a few beers, and relieved our depression.</p>
<p>After returning to camp, we heard that we would be setting off immediately, but everything was still the same that night, as if the war was still thousands of miles away. The next morning, the reveille was sounded at 6:30, but the line-up call was sounded early at 5:45. The brothers inevitably became a bit chaotic, but everyone was able to cheer up. Before long, the regimental commander came to address us. He didn't say much, only, "Brothers, we are going to set off. I don't know when we will leave or where we will go. After dispersal, you can have breakfast. Then prepare everything." He paused for a moment and said again, now everyone can realize the purpose of this dispatch. He asked if anyone in the team was not as happy as he was. We shouted in unison, "No!" He smiled, showing his teeth, and then moved on.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the order arrived. The entire team took a train to Lunner Station. We got off the train and waited under the shade of the trees by the road for a long time, waiting for all the baggage to be loaded onto the train. It is not easy to move a large number of troops. It is impossible to be fully equipped in an hour. It was not until 10:30 in the evening that we boarded the train again. Everyone was exhausted and fell asleep.</p>
<p>For two days and two nights, the train rumbled forward, with occasional long stops in between. Sometimes the train we were on stopped on a branch line, waiting for supply trains to pass. The next day, we saw refugee trains rushing towards us and passing by. There was a lot of food on the train, but mostly canned food, so we felt that the can opener attached to the back of the knife was a good friend of the soldiers on the expedition.</p>
<p>At several stations along the way, we often saw female vendors carrying teapots jumping off the train and boiling water on the platform. The teapots were already filled with tea leaves and sugar. This boiling water was supplied by station staff who were notified by telegraph on the train. I heard that during the previous European war, soldiers had to extract boiling water from the "dragon head" of the train if they wanted tea on the way to the front line. This time we have solved the tea problem satisfactorily. Unfortunately, the bathing problem is still pending, so everyone looked like they had been pulled out of a chimney when we arrived at our destination.</p>
<p>The final destination of this trip was called Qixike Lin, south of Lille. We lined up outside the station, and before long, an air raid alert came. Many people were hearing this alert for the first time, and the officers and soldiers became busy, setting up anti-aircraft guns. But in the end, it was a waste of effort, only seeing three enemy planes in the clouds. Two of our fighter planes suddenly appeared in the clouds, and the enemy planes lost their location.</p>
<p>After the air raid alert was lifted, we ate something in the orchard and crossed the train tracks to the bridge. We began to realize why our army stayed so briefly on the Belgian border. Looking from the Moon, there was the wreckage of a giant German bomber on the eastern railway line, and the rails had been twisted. Workers were clearing everything there. We boarded huge trucks at the bridgehead and moved forward, still not knowing where we were going.</p>
<p>It wasn't until we got close to the Belgian border that we first came into contact with the wartime scene. The trucks we were on were originally traveling at 30 miles per hour. Because refugees fleeing to France were surging in like a tide, the road was filled with all kinds of vehicles. Our trucks had to reduce their speed, moving as slowly as snails. The refugees were supporting the old and carrying the young, and the scene was miserable. Although we had been jolted for four days and had not rested except for dozing off, and were already exhausted, after seeing this scene of mourning, everyone couldn't help but have their blood boiling, wanting to fight the German army.</p>
<p>Finally, we arrived at our destination - called Wubogen, forty miles west of Brussels, with the Brussels Avenue leading directly there.</p>
<p>At dusk, we got off the trucks and walked into the orchard. The German air force was very active. When they flew over, there were probably 30 planes at a time, all medium bombers, flying not very high. What I found strange was why they didn't bomb the main road, which was filled with many vehicles, both military and refugee, most of which were traveling west.</p>
<p>Seeing the situation of these vehicles traveling, I suddenly realized that this situation was not an advance, but a retreat. Our task was to go as far as possible to serve as the rearguard. For several days in a row, we didn't get any news. One day: I think it was May 15th. One of the brothers who could speak French learned from a refugee that fierce fighting was taking place near Beijing [sic].</p>
<p>That night, we stayed overnight in a farmhouse near Wubogen. The cooks cheered up and made a hot meal, which was the first since we set off. Strict blackout was implemented at night. I often got up at night and wandered in the dark to see if the brothers were obeying orders. Throughout the night, we heard large numbers of German planes buzzing back and forth in the air.</p>
<p>Every morning, we understood our duties. The entire team was stationed at key intersections on the road, directing traffic, so that refugees would go into the fields and not stay on the road, in order to block and fight when the enemy army arrived.</p>
<p>At 5:00 in the morning, our army set up tank defense guns. Directing the refugees was really difficult. They could only speak the Flanders dialect, and there was a language barrier between us. If we gestured to them to leave the road, they would only pretend not to know and continue to stumble forward along the road. Some would sit down and cry incessantly. Of course, we couldn't use violence to drive away women and children, so we were at a loss. Until the brothers came up with a method. They stopped several refugees in the lead, gestured to them, pointed to the sky, then pointed to the road, and then looked at them with a terrifying expression and said, "Bomb!" After saying that, we laughed and pointed to the fields, waving our hands to tell them to go there. This method actually worked.</p>
<p>After the vehicles and pedestrians on the road were cleared, the rumbling of artillery fire in the distance gradually became closer. That morning, a battalion of rearguard troops was sent past. They fought fiercely along the Silper Canal to block the German army's advance. However, they were still very happy, swaying all the way, as if they were walking on the Buckingham Palace Avenue.</p>
<p>At noon, without yet engaging the German army, we received an order to retreat. There were very few vehicles on the road. We were inevitably a bit disheartened by the order to retreat, but because our forces were weak and there was no cover in the rear, it was useless for Britain to defend. We began to retreat and walked twenty-five miles until 1:30 in the morning. Some brothers rested in an uninhabited farmhouse. I slept on the floor under the loft, which was still comfortable.</p>
<p>The next day, we walked another twenty miles and spent the night in a village that looked like ruins. As soon as dawn broke, German planes began to bomb and strafe the village, continuing for two hours. Although the village roads were filled with our army's transport vehicles, there were no casualties in our army. The anti-aircraft fire confused their targets and eventually drove them away. In the following days, I never saw German planes fly close to their targets to bomb. Accurate anti-aircraft fire was certainly feared by them, but when I saw one of our Spitfire fighters appear, five or six German planes fled without a trace.</p>
<p>Then came another retreat—twenty miles the next day, and another twenty miles the day after. German planes always followed in groups, bombing and strafing. We gritted our teeth and moved forward. From time to time, we saw the fireworks of exploding bombs flying up in front of and behind the team, and we heard the sounds of calls for ambulances rising in quick succession. But on the whole, the number of deaths and injuries was not large.</p>
<p>We were very tired from armed marching in such continuous bombing. But one afternoon, we passed a certain unit, which had passed through our defense line on Brussels Avenue three days earlier. They were stopping by the road to eat, and in those three days, they had walked seventy-five miles.</p>
<p>That night, we arrived at Qixike Lin - returning to the place we had departed from five days ago. Once there, vehicles took us overnight to a place seven miles from Douai, where we only saw flames soaring into the sky in the city. We waited for orders in the darkness, and some of the brothers even fell asleep standing up. Douai was bombed by artillery and planes in turns, and there were many flares released by German planes in the sky, making it as bright as day. The order finally arrived, instructing our army to dig trenches along the canal embankment and hold firm. At that time, the enemy was five miles away from Douai.</p>

<h3>Shanghai to Implement Preparedness Starting Tomorrow - Becomes an Armed Fortress - Smaller Roads Barricaded and Blocked - Defense Forces, Business Corps, and Detectives to be Dispatched</h3>
<p>Public Concession and French Concession military police, with the August 13th Shanghai Battle Memorial approaching, have decided to take precautions starting at 5:00 AM on the 9th (tomorrow). At that time, Shanghai will once again present a scene of heavily armed forces. Many smaller roads along Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch will be barricaded and blocked, with additional police stationed to prevent people carrying weapons from entering. Although the preparedness measures are the same as those taken last year, the general alert will be intensified due to the recent series of terrorist acts. The Public Concession Police Department has already tightened the implementation of the curfew. Although the French Police Department has not followed suit, the French Concession has never lifted the curfew since it was implemented in 1937. In addition, police patrols will be increased. The defense forces of various countries stationed in Shanghai will cooperate with the police. Special patrol teams and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will also be prepared to be dispatched at any time from the 9th until the 14th. However, the Russian Company of the Volunteer Corps will patrol on foot and be stationed at various intersections of Avenue Edward VII.</p>
<h3>Léandre, Enthusiastic About Medicine, Receives Gold Medal, Awarded by French Ambassador Cosme</h3>
<p>Dr. Léandre, Director of the Pasteur Institute in the French Concession of this city, has devoted himself to medical research with tireless efforts. Previously, typhus, a very dangerous disease for humanity, had no perfect preventive injection. If the drug was potent, it could produce immunity, but the reaction was quite dangerous. If the drug was weak, it could avoid danger, but it was not easy to be effective. He conducted extensive research and personally experimented, having been injected with</p>
<p>Typhus</p>
<p>preventive vaccine, resulting in him contracting the disease and nearly dying. He has recently recovered his health. French Ambassador Cosme, recognizing Dr. Léandre's dedication and enthusiasm for medicine, solemnly awarded him a gold medal from the French Concession Municipal Council. The award ceremony was held at the residence of Consul General Orrent the day before yesterday afternoon. Attendees included Mrs. Cosme, Director General of the French Concession Municipal Council, Blanc, French Navy Captain Rubin, Chief Inspector of the Police Force Fafard, Director of the Philippine Health Bureau McGowan, important figures from the French Concession of this city, and</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Doctors</p>
<p>A large number of people attended the ceremony. First, the French Ambassador delivered a speech, expressing his pleasure at Dr. Léandre's recovery and his admiration for his research spirit. He also gave a brief account of Dr. Léandre's resume, stating that Dr. Léandre had served as an assistant at Marseille, then interned at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, and was subsequently sent to Guatemala in Central America to oversee health administration, work that is still praised by people in the Americas. Later, he returned to Marseille as a professor, and soon after was sent to India and then to Annam.</p>
<p>Brief Stay, Arrival in Shanghai</p>
<p>To head the French Concession Pasteur Institute. The Ambassador expressed his deep gratitude for his past work. Dr. Léandre then delivered a reply, expressing his unworthiness of the Ambassador's praise and his gratitude for the efforts and assistance of Consul General Orrent and the members of the Municipal Council. Mrs. Orrent then raised a glass of champagne to Dr. Léandre, who expressed his willingness to continue his research, hoping not to invent a vaccine, but to contribute a part of his strength.</p>
<h3>Gas Company Labor Dispute Approaching Resolution, Company May Be Flexible on the Issue of Dismissing Workers</h3>
<p>The labor dispute at the British-owned Gas Company has shown signs of improvement since Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing of the Municipal Council intervened for a second time. The attitudes of both labor and management are gradually converging, and a satisfactory resolution is expected in the coming days. According to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, Mr. Yu visited the company the day before yesterday to meet with Chairman Chadoury to mediate, and explained the workers' demands to Chadoury again. The company's attitude was more moderate than before, but it could not agree to stop hiring White Russian and Jewish workers, and insisted on dismissing some "unstable" workers. After Mr. Yu's explanation, the company authorities may be flexible on the issue of dismissing workers. They agreed to consider other demands and respond later. Mr. Yu then left and is scheduled to meet with Chadoury again today. At 11:00 a.m. yesterday, Mr. Yu reported to the workers' representatives on the progress of his talks with the company authorities, and advised the workers to maintain order and wait patiently for a response.

<p>Newspaper Owner Also Threatened</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Chirikin, the publisher of the Russian-language daily newspaper in this city, also received a threatening phone call yesterday, threatening his life.

<p>At the same time, the French Concession Police Department continues to investigate the assassination of detective Yang Lao Fovski, but the motive for the case is still unknown.

<h3>Investigation into the Bombing of Yongkang, Japanese Planes Bomb Yuyao for Days</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Association in Shanghai yesterday continued to receive reports on the situation after the recovery of Zhenhai. The reports are recorded below. Ningbo issued three air raid alerts the day before yesterday. At 8:43 a.m., two Japanese planes were spotted over Qiancang. It was later learned that the two Japanese planes dropped 13 bombs on the urban area of Yongkang. The locations of the bombs were: one bomb in a certain location, two bombs near the prison, and one bomb on a certain bridge. A total of more than 100 houses were destroyed. Dozens of people were killed or injured. Because the bombs dropped by the Japanese planes were mixed with incendiary bombs, several houses in the city caught fire. At 9:06 a.m., the Japanese planes flew towards Shipu and left the sea. At 10:50 a.m. for the second time, three Japanese planes were spotted over Shengxian, flying east in formation. At 11:01 a.m., they appeared over Yuyao, circling back and forth. They then dropped one bomb near the restaurant, two bombs in a certain location in the eastern suburbs, and several bombs on Heming Bridge and Lijiawan. One bomb in front of the Qingchang Fish Market, due to flying shrapnel, injured two people. There were no other losses.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Situation</p>
<p>At 9:13 a.m. yesterday, one Japanese plane was spotted over Wenling. At the same time, two Japanese planes were spotted over Linghai. The Japanese planes spotted over Linghai passed through Hengshan, Songao, Xiangshan, and Shipu from south to southwest, and then dropped two bombs on Yongjia. The details are unknown. At 11:43 a.m., two Japanese planes were spotted over Wenling again. Ningbo immediately issued another emergency air raid alert. The two planes then passed over the northeast of Ningbo, Cixi from south to north, circling over Cixi for more than ten minutes, and then flew to Yuyao to wreak havoc again.

After the defending troops retaliated, they retreated. Also, inquiries were made to the Daitong and BeiDa telegraph companies on Avenue Edward VII last night. It was said that telegrams from Shanghai to Wenzhou were still being sent and received as usual, without any changes.</p>
<h3>Mail in the French Concession Continues to Be Inspected, Public Anxious About Delivery</h3>
<p>Since the mail at the Masnan Road Post Office in the French Concession was suddenly inspected and detained in large quantities by Japanese inspectors starting on the 5th of this month, the inspectors have been carrying out this kind of inspection and detention work every day. At 8:30 a.m. yesterday morning, eight Japanese inspectors continued to arrive at the post office, and a large number of various types of mail were still selected and taken away for inspection. Registered express mail was also not exempt. However, after the Japanese inspectors finished the inspection, most of the mail that was deemed to be unrelated was returned, and there were few confiscations. However, the public cannot help but feel anxious about delivering mail within the French Concession, regarding it as a fearful undertaking.</p>
<h3>French Concession Rent Committee Discusses Fixed-Term Leases, Court Orders Eviction, Tenants Request Relief</h3>
<p>The Chinese-speaking groups of the first and second teams of the French Concession Rent Investigation Committee held a second joint small group meeting at the French Concession Ratepayers' Association at 8:00 p.m. the day before yesterday. In addition to jointly discussing the opinions of Fu Dongju on the "malpractices of fixed-term leases and the impact on public security," there were no other discussions. Fu said that he rented No. 6, Lane 342, Avenue Road from the owner and had a fixed-term lease. Now that the term has expired, a lawsuit has been filed and a decision has been made to evict him. He said that the court's order for tenants to move out when the lease expires, although based on the law, does not take into account the situation in extraordinary times. The applicant's opinion is that after the Civil Code, the administrative authorities should formulate temporary relief measures, such as Chongqing and Hong Kong, which have temporary housing measures to adapt to extraordinary times. In addition, the housing relief section of the Land Law can also be used for reference. Tenants account for the majority of society, while owners are in the minority. Every time a lease expires, the owner uses the law to order eviction in order to collect tips and increase the rent. Over time, residents will be unable to withstand the pressure, which could lead to disputes and hinder social order, which will affect public security. The administrative authorities should take this into account and conduct joint research. It was immediately decided to submit the issue of relief for lease expirations to the next "General Assembly" for discussion. As for the impact on public security, it was requested that the General Assembly forward it to the Concession Administrative Authorities for special attention. It is reported that the French Concession will take into account both the law and human feelings when dealing with housing issues, and may formulate temporary relief measures, but there is no prospect of this yet.</p>

They also distributed "Notice One," which stated that a "founding assembly" would be held next week at the former Shanghai Chamber of Commerce on North Henan Road.

<h3>Refugees From Chongming Talk About Atrocities, Confirm Thousands of Houses Destroyed, Number of Civilian Casualties Varies Widely</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that the Japanese soldiers on Chongming Island, angered by the attacks of the guerrillas, burned houses and massacred civilians on a large scale in retaliation. The residents of the island suffered a great disaster and fled to Shanghai. Shortly after 6:00 p.m. yesterday (the 6th), approximately 500 people arrived here, mostly women and children. Their relatives and friends in Shanghai gathered at the Bund on Avenue Edward VII to meet them. Many other Chongming refugees will also flee to Shanghai in the coming days. The refugees who arrived in Shanghai yesterday came on the Zhejiang Maru, carrying bundles and bags.</p>
<p>Hunger and Exhaustion</p>
<p>After disembarking and meeting with relatives and friends, they described in detail the terrifying scenes of their hometown, still with lingering fears. Many Chongming residents in Shanghai were also waiting on the Bund for their relatives and friends who had not arrived in Shanghai, and asked other refugees for news. A reporter spoke with the refugees and confirmed that the residents of Chongming had indeed suffered atrocities in the past few days. However, the number of civilians who were massacred varied widely among the refugees.</p>
<p>Varying Accounts</p>
<p>Some said they had witnessed the massacre of more than 100 civilian men in the Chenghuang Temple on the island. It is said that the Japanese soldiers summoned these men to the temple, pretending to hold a meeting, and the Japanese captain gave a speech. Unexpectedly, when they arrived at the temple, they were strafed by Japanese soldiers with machine guns. Those who were not killed were bayoneted to death. Other refugees said that they had seen several other groups of civilians who were also massacred. The number of people trapped in houses and buried in the flames was even greater. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the total number of civilians killed until detailed information is received.</p>
<p>Civilians Killed</p>
<p>However, the civilians all agreed that thousands of houses had been set on fire and destroyed by the Japanese soldiers. It is said that those killed by the Japanese soldiers were not guerrillas. When the massacre began, the guerrillas had already hidden their weapons and retreated.</p>

In addition to the name and address, only the word "safe" is mentioned. As for the letters inquiring about relatives in France and Belgium through the International Red Cross, no reply has been received yet.</p>

<h3>Italian Merchant Ship Changde Sailed to Gutou Yesterday, Whether it Arrived Must Await Telegram, Small Ships Sailed to Cen Port, etc.</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese Navy announced the blockade of Zhejiang and Fujian outer ports on the 16th of last month, the foreign ships sailing there have been suspended one after another. More than two weeks have passed, and there is no hope of resumption. However, the waters above the Sanjiangkou are still being cleared and sailed as usual. Today, the Shenyou ship is sailing. As for the rumors that foreign ships are requesting the consuls of their respective countries to negotiate with the Japanese authorities in order to maintain navigation rights, there may be some truth to it. However, since the Japanese Navy is using the excuse of military operations in the blocked ports, the hope of sailing is very slim. Recently, some small ships have sailed to Cen Port, Li Port, Songmen and other places outside Zhenhai Port. They are going to the interior of eastern Zhejiang, which is still separated by a sea surface. Whether they can achieve their purpose cannot be predicted yet. It must await the Changde's telegrams in the next few days. The customhouses at Cen Port, Li Port and Gutou, etc., do not have branch checkpoints. Ships sailing to the above-mentioned places are cleared with inland total (I.W.) clearance.</p>
<h3>"Cotton Yarn Exchange" Finally Dissolved</h3>
<p>Last year, the Japanese side began preparing to establish a "cotton yarn exchange" in this city. However, due to the deep understanding and righteousness of the cotton yarn industry in Shanghai, they refused to cooperate, and it ultimately fell through. Around July this year, someone contacted the Japanese side, believing that the environment in Shanghai was special and that there was an opportunity to take advantage of it. They agreed to open the market on August 1 and named it "Cotton Yarn 引所". However, since its establishment, more than a week has passed and no one has come to the door, and there is no yarn to auction. As a result, the auction has not been completed. The Japanese side is deeply dissatisfied with this and it is rumored that the "Asia Development Board" has ordered it to be dissolved as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Two Suspects Arrested in Wang Zhenji Kidnapping Case</h3>

<h3>Continuous Heavy Rains and Abundant Precipitation: 24.8 Centimeters of Rain in Two Days, Yesterday's Rain Coincided with High Tide, Causing Street Flooding</h3>
<p>This summer, the rainfall in this city has been extremely scarce. Although there were two rainfalls during the typhoon's passage through Shanghai, the weather turned clear immediately after the storm, and the rainfall was limited. However, at 5:30 PM the day before yesterday, lightning flashed, and heavy rain followed, lasting for over an hour. Due to the torrential rain, the drains on all the roads could not discharge the water in time, and water accumulated, forming channels, with depths exceeding half a foot in places.</p>
<p>Tidal Surge and Sudden Rain</p>
<p>Yesterday, at around 11:00 AM, it rained again, accompanied by thunder. The rain was torrential, lasting for over two hours before gradually easing. From 2:00 PM onwards, the rain stopped completely. During the period of heavy rain, due to the high tide in the Huangpu River, the water on the roads could not be discharged. The sewers were flooded with tidal water, further deepening the accumulation of water. Areas such as the Rising Sun Building on Nanjing Road were submerged in a vast expanse of water. Nearby areas such as Yinhua Street, Guangxi Road, Zhejiang Road, Jiujiang Road, as well as Gansu Road, Avenue Foch, Chengdu Road, Avenue Saussure, and the Bund, had water depths ranging from several points to half a foot, creating a sea of water. Vehicles splashed water as they passed, and pedestrians in neat attire had to use rickshaws to cross the roads.</p>
<p>Rainfall and Tide Levels</p>
<p>The reason why the accumulated water on the roads could not be discharged quickly was related to the high tide in the Huangpu River. According to observations, high tides in the Huangpu River began suddenly on the 3rd of this month, with levels around 10 feet. The water level in the Huangpu River rose sharply, and the accumulated water on the roads could not be discharged immediately. It had to wait for the tide to recede before it could be drained. It is expected that there will be high tides in the Huangpu River today and tomorrow, with levels also exceeding 11 feet. It will only return to normal after the 10th of this month. From the evening of the day before yesterday until 5:00 PM yesterday, the total rainfall was 24.8 centimeters. The sky remained overcast and gloomy throughout the day yesterday, with clouds billowing. Additionally, the wind had subsided, so the weather was not refreshing.</p>
<p>Typhoon Dissipated</p>
<p>The newly formed typhoon in the Pacific Ocean has been moving slowly for several days. After reaching 17 degrees north latitude and 134 degrees east longitude in the Pacific Ocean, it stalled. At 6:00 AM yesterday, the Xujiahui Observatory reported that the typhoon had dissipated, so the typhoon threat to this city has been lifted. There are no new typhoons forming in the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<h3>Nurse's Sudden Death Case, Prosecutor's Office Files Charges Yesterday, Failure to Report to the Police and Submit for Examination According to Regulations, Forging Evidence, Requesting Public Trial</h3>
<p>Li Jieru, also known as Li Yuying, a female nurse from Fujian and head nurse at the Chinese-Western Sanatorium at 536 Shilu Road, died suddenly in the sanatorium on the night of June 10th. Due to the unclear cause of death, the prosecutor's office of the Second Special District ordered a coffin inspection. The details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that Zhao Changmin, the prosecutor of the prosecutor's office handling the case, formally submitted an indictment to the criminal court of the court yesterday.</p>
<p>Indictment</p>
<p>The indictment is transcribed as follows: Indictment of the Prosecutor of the First Special District Local Court of Jiangsu Shanghai. Defendant: Lu Zhenqing, male, 39 years old, from Beiping, Director of the Chinese-Western Sanatorium. Lin Zhengliang, male, 38 years old, from Ningbo, Physician of the Chinese-Western Sanatorium. The above defendants are involved in a case of forging evidence. After the investigation was completed, it was deemed that a prosecution should be initiated. The facts, reasons, and applicable laws are listed below. (Facts) Lu Zhenqing, the Director of the Chinese-Western Sanatorium at 536 Shilu Road, who is the first defendant in this case, opened the door to the room of Li Jieru, also known as Li Yuying, the head nurse of the sanatorium, with a key at 10:00 AM on June 11th this year. He entered the room with his nephew, who was already waiting in front of the door, and found her dead in bed. Subsequently, Lu Zhenqing told Li Konglan to go home and inform her grandparents, Li Shiling and Li Linshi. However, he did not report to the police and submit the body for examination according to regulations. Instead, he ordered Lin Zhengliang, the physician of the sanatorium, who is the second defendant in this case, to issue a death certificate stating that she died of a stroke. He moved the body to the Chinese Funeral Home and injected it with embalming fluid, intending to purchase land for burial. At this point, Lei Huayun reported the incident to this court and the French police, stating that Li Jieru died under unclear circumstances and requested an investigation to comfort the wronged soul. Based on this, the police sent investigators to investigate and ordered the coffin to be inspected. This court sent personnel to inspect the body, first examining the exterior and then performing an autopsy to examine the interior. They also took the undigested food from the stomach and intestines for analysis. The result determined that she died of acute heart failure. An autopsy report was filled out and attached to the file. After being questioned at the autopsy site, the defendants were considered to be suspected, and they were summoned to the sanatorium for further interrogation. (Reasons and applicable laws) It was found that Lu Zhenqing was a criminal suspect in the case of Li Jieru's death under unclear circumstances, which had been reported by someone and investigated by the police and this court. According to Lin Zhengliang, he did not know the cause of death but followed the instructions of the first defendant to forge a death certificate stating that she died of a stroke. Lu Zhenqing did not know the cause of death but did not report the death for examination according to regulations to clarify the truth. Instead, he instructed the second defendant to issue this certificate in order to send the body to the funeral home and bury it. All of this has been confessed multiple times and is supported by the death certificate attached to the file. Although Lu Zhenqing claimed that the deceased's father had asked him to issue a certificate for sending the body to the funeral home and that the second defendant was present at the time and could testify, Li Shizhen absolutely denied this, and Lin Zhengliang also said that he had not heard of it. Regardless of whether Lu Zhenqing intended to conceal other crimes, his actions clearly violated Article 29, Paragraph 1, and Article 165, Paragraph 1, of the Criminal Law. Lin Zhengliang's actions violated Article 165, Paragraph 1, of the same law. Therefore, in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1, of the Criminal Procedure Law, a prosecution is initiated and a public trial is requested. After receiving the indictment, the court held a hearing in the criminal court yesterday, presided over by Judge Zhu Chuzhe. The defendants Lu Zhenqing and Lin Zhengliang, accompanied by their defense attorneys Ling Changyan and Shan Yuhua, appeared in court.

The court briefly questioned the two defendants and adjourned the hearing to August 21st. The defendants were released on their original bail.</p>

<h3>Jiangxi Actively Promotes National Education, Reorganizes Rural Central Schools, and Reorganizes Bao National Schools</h3>

<h3>Hong Kong Unified Examination Papers to be Graded Locally, Grading to be Completed by Mid-Month</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) The unified enrollment of national institutions of higher education last month had a total of 1,000 male and female applicants in the Hong Kong division, with more than 8,000 examination papers. The papers were originally scheduled to be sent to the Kunming Unified Examination Enrollment Committee for grading. However, according to information from the Hong Kong division enrollment office, the Ministry of Education has decided that due to inconvenient transportation between Hong Kong and Yunnan and difficulties in transporting the papers, sending them by air would require postage of more than 2,900 yuan. Therefore, it has been decided to hire local celebrities in Hong Kong to grade the papers. The Hong Kong office of the Unified Examination Enrollment Committee has hired 50 people, including Xu Dishan, Guan Zhaopeng, Zhang Lanzhou, Li Yin, and Hao Yixin, as paper grading committee members. It is reported that the grading will be completed by mid-month, and then the list of new students will be telegraphed to the Ministry of Education for approval and publication.</p>
<p>Relief Student Association Approves Pre-registration</p>
<p>Since its establishment last year, the Hong Kong Relief Student Committee has organized registration for relief for out-of-school students for thirteen sessions, providing assistance to 372 middle school and university students, with expenditures of 1,096 national currency and HK$0,933.46. Its work has been well received by the education community. The committee has now begun organizing the fourteenth session of registration for relief for out-of-school students. According to the person in charge of the committee, there are 1,072 applicants for the Kunming division in Hong Kong for the unified enrollment of national institutions of higher education. Based on last year's experience, many of these candidates will apply to the committee for registration. However, most of them apply for registration at the committee only after the results of the unified examination are released. After each registration deadline, a rigorous investigation is conducted to prove that the applicant's family is indeed poor, lacks travel expenses, and cannot afford to continue their studies before they can receive travel assistance. However, this year, due to transportation difficulties, new students who are admitted after the release of the unified examination results may be delayed on their journey to school and may not be able to arrive by the scheduled start date. Therefore, new regulations have been made, allowing all applicants for the unified examination to obtain application forms from the committee with their admission tickets and apply for pre-registration. After investigation, those who are deemed qualified to receive travel assistance can collect their travel expenses from the committee immediately after the release of the unified examination results and proceed to school, avoiding delays in their studies. This registration will close on the 10th of this month. Poor candidates can obtain registration forms and relief regulations from the following locations before the 10th of this month: (1) YWCA, Bonham Road; (2) YMCA, Bridges Street; (3) YMCA Branch, Kowloon; (4) Sheng Yi Book Society, Ice House Street.</p>
<h3>Recent Developments at the Education Psychology Research Institute of National Central University</h3>
<p>Since Professor Ai Wei took charge of the Education Psychology Research Institute of National Central University, the work has been progressing with great effort. Professor Ai, realizing that middle school teachers in the country deeply lack reference materials for experimental research, created the quarterly journal "Educational Psychology Research" to meet this need.

The inaugural issue has already been published. In addition, in order to test whether the amount of teaching material for each subject prescribed by the experimental curriculum standard is suitable for students' abilities, the institute has set up experimental classes for controlled research. Other works, such as research on the psychology of learning various subjects in primary and secondary schools, research on the connection between classical and vernacular Chinese, the development of psychological scales for identifying abnormal children, and the completion of intelligence and educational tests for primary and secondary schools, are also actively underway.</p>

<h3>Finance. Exceptionally High Foreign Exchange Settlement. Huge Amounts for Foreign Rice.</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed rates. In the unofficial market for British and American currency, a slight easing appeared in the early morning, but it was fleeting, and tightening soon followed. Initially, American banks and others showed strong interest in supplying, and speculators also sold off slightly. Then, due to a high exchange rate of 2.25 points, numerous transactions of American dollars occurred at $5.75. Later, the China &amp; South Sea Bank offered favorable rates, and Sassoon, a British firm, had a strong appetite for buying. It was also heard that settlement for imported foreign rice was substantial, with speculators returning to buy. At noon, HSBC also made purchases, pushing the market steadily softer until the afternoon closing. The closing rates were 3/71875 for British currency, 7/1875 for three-month bills, 0/9375 for American dollars, and $5.625. Daily trading saw less British currency and more American dollars.

It was recorded that American banks sold August American dollars to Sassoon at $5.75, and speculators also sold August American dollars to the China &amp; South Sea Bank, also at $5.75. Foreign firms and Chinese banks traded August American dollars at $5.75, and September American dollars traded at $5.65625. HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged.

Demand for British currency notes was strong, pushing prices up by $0.30. Demand for American currency notes was exceptionally strong, reportedly due to some dealers refusing to accept large $100 notes, leading to a sudden shortage in circulation. As a result, the price temporarily rose to $17.90 in the afternoon, eventually settling slightly lower at $17.85, a gain of $0.43 compared to the previous day.

<h3>Gold Market Plunges and Then Soars Again Due to Repeated Purchases by Hong Kong Banks</h3>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial market for spot gold saw brisk trading and rising prices due to improved confidence. Prices surged from a low point, creating substantial buying pressure. The opening price was only $5,540, due to slightly firmer opening exchange rates. Although gold and silver firms bought and raised the price to $5,575, the upward trend soon stopped and even declined by $10. Subsequently, due to tightening exchange rates, Hong Kong banks aggressively bought, and selling disappeared from the market. Some smaller money changers reportedly sold, but the imbalance was significant, and prices jumped past the $5,600 mark. After reaching $5,630, prices fell slightly by several tens of dollars, but the final buying pressure, such as gold firms, continued unabated, raising the closing price to the highest point of $5,650, a gain of $70 compared to the previous day. The market remained strong after closing. It was reported that the largest off-market transaction reached $5,680. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday. Nearly 2,000 taels were traded in half a day. Jewelry shops increased the price of gold ornaments by $10. The Maritime Customs gold price remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Closes at a High Price</p>
<p>From the morning, with the exchange rate rising, American dollars hardening, and the initial selling pressure strong, the initial price for each bar (ten taels) was only $5,540, a decrease of $40 from yesterday's trading. Subsequently, with the support of buying by silver and gold firms, prices soon recovered by $35. Silver firms bought 50 taels from gold firms at $5,575. Soon, a short position trader from a money exchange increased their short position, causing prices to fall slightly to $5,565. Later, with the exchange market tightening, buying suddenly increased, and securities firms and silver firms competed to buy. Moreover, Hong Kong banks secretly purchased, and prices soon exceeded the $5,600 mark, followed by further buying from gold firms, continuing to rise by $30. Gold firms bought 30 taels from silver firms at $5,630. Unexpectedly, a securities firm suddenly decided to sell, releasing a significant amount, causing prices to fall back to the $5,600 level. However, buying resumed at noon, rising again. With gold firms and silver firms competing to buy, prices surged another $50, resulting in a closing price of $5,650, the highest price of the day, a gain of $70 compared to the previous evening's closing, with a fluctuation of $110 in half a day. The selling price for spot gold from the official brands of gold firms was several tens of dollars higher than the spot gold price, while the purchase price was $30 lower. The current margin was more than $50 lower than the listed price, with few transactions taking place.</p>
<p>Price of Gold Ornaments Increased by Ten Dollars</p>
<p>The initial selling price of gold jewelry per tael in major shops remained at $570. However, at 11:20 AM, the price increased by $10. There were no further changes after that. Major shops changed their listed price to $580. New shops had similar prices, with purchase prices reduced by about $30.</p>
<p>Exchange Rates Remain Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday's exchange rates for drafts and notes remained stable. The discount rate per thousand dollars remained unchanged throughout the day, with a purchase rate of $47 and a selling rate of $49, the same as the previous day. The interbank lending rate of the Money Traders Association remained unchanged at 1.7 points for both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3>Securities. Domestic Debt Makes Small Recovery</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market for securities saw a slight recovery. This was a trend expected after several days of consecutive gains. If prices continue to fall slightly today, there will certainly be short covering. Yesterday morning and afternoon saw short covering. Purchases of the Ding-type stock of the 16th issue continued unabated. Other stocks, such as those of Tung Shun, Chiu Feng, Yan Chong, etc., were purchased throughout the day. Lian Yi also absorbed a significant amount in the morning. Lian He initially sold and then bought. Tong Kang and Xin Fu also made significant purchases. However, Yi Tai, De Fu, Xin Chong, Tong Xing, and the 35th issue experienced greater selling pressure, causing afternoon prices to fall slightly. Ding-type stock was the strongest, with investor confidence remaining stable. Short sellers covered on small dips, indicating that their position was not as strong as the long position. As a result of the day's trading, most prices recovered by 0.05 to 0.15, while Ding-type stock performed better, gaining 0.05. The total volume of transactions was estimated at over $800,000. A concise summary is provided below.</p>
<p>Stock Transactions: Five shares of the China Bookstore were traded at a price of $30.25 per share.</p>

Only new and old stocks of Jardine Matheson were very active, trending steadily upward in the morning without any decline. The prices of other stocks slightly increased at the beginning of the morning, but were immediately offset by selling pressure, with prices showing no difference from the opening.</p>
<p>London, 6th (Tuesday) dispatch: Today's listed market prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks showed little change. Only HSBC shares fell by £1 each, with British registered shares at £62 and Hong Kong registered shares at £65. The others showed no changes.</p>
<h3>Grains. Large Quantities of Foreign Rice Arriving. Market Rises After Initial Fall Yesterday.</h3>
<p>The market for foreign rice, which had been showing a trend of initial tightening followed by fatigue for the past two days, reversed its previous behavior yesterday, showing a pattern of initial fatigue followed by consolidation. At the opening, both buyers and sellers were wary of the remaining momentum, and were hesitant to act. Clever speculators seized the opportunity to employ their usual tactic of "feigning retreat," releasing large quantities of rice onto the market, causing prices to fall steadily. By midday, prices had fallen by nearly one dollar, with No. 1 old Saigon at only $57.50 to $57.00, No. 2 at $51.50, fired broken rice at $56.50, and small broken rice at $52. At this moment, speculators recognized that the time was right and abruptly changed their strategy, turning from selling to buying, and bids rose continuously. As a result, the overall situation changed dramatically, becoming exceptionally active, with prices steadily recovering. Ultimately, the total trading for the day, after one fall and one rise, recovered to the original level, similar to the previous closing price. Yesterday, buyers from Shantou inquired about various grades of rice, with No. 2 Saigon offered at $62.50 and No. 2 Siam at $61.50 to $62.50, both higher by $0.50 compared to the previous day. The transit rice of No. 2 Siam, which had not been reported for import, was absorbed by Shantou buyers, with prices rising to $62.80 and $63.00, a larger increase of $1 compared to the previous day. A total of 7,000 bags of spot rice were offered, while there were 400 to 500 tons of original bags returning to the market.</p>
<p>There were rumors that the trading of japonica and glutinous domestic rice in the unofficial market was similarly balanced in terms of supply and demand, with stable prices and no changes. Changbang rice was offered at $68.50 to $68.00, Nangang early rice original bags at $64.00 to $65.00, and bulk rice at $61.50, $61.00, and Jinli special rice at $61.00 to $62.00.</p>
<p>Due to scant arrivals of Zhou oil new japonica rice, only seven shi (石) were listed, and prices continued to rise by $0.50 due to rain. The opening price was $63.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 1,388 bags of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai, shipped from Hong Kong on the Tai Gu Company's Qiongzhou ship, docking at the company's wharf in Pudong for unloading. It is reported that a large quantity of foreign rice will arrive in Shanghai this week. The Hua Lun Ge Lan ship is carrying rice from Siam to Shanghai and is expected to arrive today.</p>
<h3>Northern Merchants Purchase By-products</h3>
<p>Flour: Trading was slightly more active yesterday. In addition to the daily needs of local retail sales, sales to customers also gradually increased. It is said that the routes to the north, which had been quiet for a long time, have improved recently due to increased local demand, so telegrams were sent to purchase Shanghai flour, with by-product flour being even more sought after due to its lower price. Some merchants from the south also dabbled in it, causing the market to strengthen somewhat. The selling price for No. 2 brand and Fortress Double Eagle brand foreign flour was $16, with 4,000 to 5,000 bags traded. Domestic flour remained at $15, with limited supply. The Phoenix brand flour from Japanese factories initially fell but then tightened, with September flour opening at $13.80 and then recovering to $14. The market for other miscellaneous brands of flour remained stable.</p>
<p>Wheat: There were no special developments in the market yesterday. Sellers mostly waited for opportunities to unload their goods. Japanese and Chinese factories did not lower prices to attract buyers. Therefore, apart from scattered deliveries to factories, there were no new large-scale transactions.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton. Weak Spot Sales Make it Difficult for Yarn Prices to Rise.</h3>
<p>The yarn market has entered a period of fluctuation again. However, due to the continued weakness of foreign exchange rates, investor sentiment has not improved, mainly because spot sales of yarn are not smooth, making it difficult for speculators to be very enthusiastic. However, its trajectory is relatively stable, and it is feared that there will not be major changes. The fundamental problem is that sales are too slow. The current situation is to sell slightly when prices rise and buy when prices fall, which is more economical.</p>
<p>The opening of the spot yarn market in the morning was weak. Because exchange rates eased on the afternoon of the 10th, some long positions were sold off, and snatchers took advantage of the situation to push down prices. At the opening, the price of 10-count Double Horse yarn was $1,005. Few sellers offered at this price, and the market gradually improved again. It was later heard that exchange rates had tightened and gold had become expensive, and buying sentiment increased, gradually rising to $1,015. However, it declined again after the close. According to statistics, 1,905 bales were traded in half a day. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by $2.50. Yesterday, 637 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Yantai, and 705 bales were shipped to Hong Kong. Another 625 bales will also be shipped to Hong Kong today. The amount of purchases made by each group is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 1,700, Industry: 1,420</p>
<p>Mainland: 200, Yunnan: 100</p>
<p>Xiamen: 15, Total: 1,905</p>
<h3>Textile Factories Become Active One After Another. Cotton Market Sees Great Development and Prices Also Improve Significantly.</h3>
<p>The cotton market, which has been quiet for a long time, saw exchange rates contract yesterday, and trading among industry members became active again. At the same time, factories, due to the stability of yarn prices and not having purchased for a long time, also had the idea of replenishing their inventories. As a result, spot cotton trading saw great development, and prices improved accordingly. However, the situation in the overseas Indian and American cotton markets remained sluggish. Today, 100 bales of cotton will be shipped to Hong Kong. The details of the spot cotton transactions are listed on the left:</p>
<p>White Luo to: 204.00 Xinyu Progress: 200 bales</p>
<p>Brazilian Cotton</p>
<p>229.50 Japan China Progress 1,500 bales</p>
<p>Durilla: 100.00 Also: 200 bales</p>
<p>Dazhongji: 30.50 Xinyu Progress 1,500 bales</p>
<p>General Bundled: 186.00 Also: 300 bales</p>
<p>Xinxiang: 190.00 Shenxin Progress: 100 bales</p>
<p>Fine Velvet Package: 207.00 Also: 200 bales</p>
<p>Pengjiapu: 226.50 Also: 100 bales</p>
<p>Fire Machine Grass: Fire Machine 159.00 Dakang Progress: 200 bales</p>
<p>General Bundled: 181.50 Also: 200 bales</p>
<p>NT 226.00 Japan China Progress: 300 bales</p>
<p>The above factory transactions are all spot deliveries to factories</p>
<p>Fire Grass Package: 152.00 Thirty-one Progress: 67 bales</p>
<p>Fire Bundled: 159.00 Also thirty bales</p>
<p>Tongzhou: 20.00 Also: 14 bales</p>
<p>Pingguoer: 138.00 Also 100 bales</p>
<p>Tongzhou 168.50 Yuan Cheng Progress 107 bales</p>
<p>General Bundled: 171.50 Thirty-one Progress 230 bales</p>
<p>Miterlin: 40.00 Industry Progress 100 bales</p>
<p>Fire Machine: 185.00 Also: 130 bales</p>
<p>The above industry transactions are all stock deliveries</p>
<p>Another news report stated that New York cotton prices were weak, with very quiet spot trading. Wall Street stocks were weak, and the closing price fell by three pounds compared to the previous day. Indian prices, including forecasts, rose by over one rupee.</p>
<p>Spot cotton trading in Shanghai was quite lively yesterday, but all were silver futures transactions by Japanese manufacturers, numbering over a thousand bales. However, trading on the Chinese side remained exceptionally quiet.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Textile Factories Resume Work, Focusing on Foreign Exchange for Advances and Retreats, Not Emphasizing Supply and Demand</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: The market rose after an initial fall yesterday, and the situation was stable. After a slight improvement in cloth sales, textile factories that had stopped work gradually decided to resume. However, actual sales remained mediocre. Stockpilers focused on foreign exchange rates for their advances and retreats, neglecting the state of supply and demand. Selling prices still fluctuated between $0.25 and $0.50, and the results were almost the same as the previous day. Customer sales were normal. Merchants from eastern Zhejiang purchased over 100 pieces of coarse cloth and colored cloth. Merchants from Fujian and Guangdong purchased 110 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Merchants from Yantai purchased nearly 100 pieces of coarse cloth and melton. Retailers in the local area purchased over 200 pieces, with purchases declining. In the afternoon, dye factories absorbed over 300 pieces of raw cloth.</p>
<p>Dongbu Cloth: The market for Longtou fine white cloth was soft in the morning. Then, due to the firm investor sentiment and continued purchases by fellow traders, it rose to $32.15 by noon. Later, merchants from Tianjin and Yantai purchased 300 bales of Longtou cloth, gradually pushing up the market, with sales reaching $32.75. However, it fell back slightly at the close, with Longtou fine cloth at $32.65, Four Gentlemen beaverteen at $0.94, and mid-grade fine cloth and fine twill generally stable.</p>
<p>Exports: Yesterday, 598 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Yantai, 315 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, and 4 pieces were shipped to Tianjin. Today (August 8), 400 pieces will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Sales of Woolen Fabrics Limited</h3>
<p>Demand for woolen fabrics from customer groups has been lacking recently. Merchants from inland regions are unable to continue their business due to transportation disruptions, exchange rate issues, and the need to pay 75% tax. Most of the occupied areas are controlled by Japanese merchants. Cargo transportation to North China has mostly stopped, and trade is conducted through bartering in Nanjing. As a result, sales of woolen fabrics to customer groups of all sizes in the inland and occupied areas have been restricted. When Shanghai-Ningbo ships were operating, merchants were still able to find ways to do business. However, now that the ships have stopped, the scope of sales has narrowed, and sales of woolen fabrics will depend entirely on the isolated concessions of Muji Street.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea. Silk Sales Quiet.</h3>
<p>The New York silk market has been flat and weak, with very little trading. The exchange has been trading only ten bales a day for several days, which is unprecedentedly quiet. Therefore, this has affected silk prices in Japan. For the past twenty days, Yokohama silk prices have been at 1,350 yuan for spot, with no rise or fall for over half a month. This is because the Japanese government has allocated funds to maintain silk prices. Therefore, there is little hope for price increases in the future. The local silk market was affected by the decline in exchange rates. British and French firms were becoming active. White factory grade 78 was at 4,885 yuan, grade 81 was at 4,950 yuan, and grade 83 was at 5,050 yuan, with only 50 dan (担) traded. However, the prices for the trading firms were 200 to 300 yuan higher than the Japanese firms. Yesterday, 208 pieces of tea were shipped to Hong Kong and 1,125 pieces were shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains. New Oxhide Soybeans and Yellow Soybeans Appear. Procurement and Transportation Permits are Very Expensive.</h3>
<p>In addition to the soybeans from Jiujiang, the earliest to appear on the market are the oxhide soybeans from Changzhou. It is said that these soybeans have been available in the production area for two weeks, but have not been shipped to Shanghai because the cost of procurement and transportation permits is too high. Yesterday, small samples of these soybeans were seen in the market. The quality of these soybeans is excellent this year due to the dry weather, and the harvest is also abundant. The cost in the production area is 34-35 yuan (calculated per 160 market catties), and the cost of transportation to Shanghai, including hemp bags, is about 32-33 yuan per dan. Therefore, merchants are unsure about the external costs and are temporarily hesitant to transport them. The market for old soybeans was slightly soft yesterday, with thin trading. There were only 50 bags of Wuhu soybeans traded in the local area, with prices listed in the market price column, as well as over 40 bags of Chongming sand yellow soybeans and 20 bags of Dalian mixed green soybeans.</p>
<p>Also, 155 bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong today, and 1,745 tins of raw oil were also shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market. Supply Falls Short of Demand and Prices Continue to Rise.</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market rose from flat to higher as the value of the American dollar contracted by 0.09375 and supply fell short of demand, resulting in increases ranging from several cents to one dollar. The price of No. 24 coarse white sugar was $70.05 per bag for sugar stored locally and $71.00 in the afternoon. The price of foreign-stored sugar was $70.00, $70.05, and $71.00. The price of transshipped sugar with a release date of August 15 was $55.30, and with a release date of August 22 was $55.55. Tai Gu brand B was $73.00, $73.20, and $73.50. DY brand was $70.04 for the Dong stockyard and $69.70 for the HX West stockyard. Dutch cotton white sugar was $71.00, Dutch red sugar was $57.00 and $57.50. The price of white sugar from local factories was $70.05 to $71.00.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 2,400 tons of sugar arrived from Holland, and 766 bags and 359 cases arrived from Haikou.</p>
<h3>Coal. Coal Balls Continue to Increase by Eight Yuan, at $7.20 Per Dan.</h3>
<p>Coal ball prices were raised by the manufacturer's guild yesterday by 8 yuan due to tightening exchange rates and rising costs. The list prices for Nanyang Yitai Xingguo Hua coal balls were 132 yuan per ton from the factory, with additional charges for delivery. Street vendors sold them for $7.20 per dan (100 market catties), an increase of four cents compared to the previous week.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous. Candle Sales Sluggish Due to Hot Weather.</h3>
<p>The candle market situation, due to foreign exchange, high raw material costs, led to price increases, resulting in the industry all stockpiling supplies. Due to weather conditions, sales have been sluggish. Market inventories for candles are full, making it difficult to sell for the moment. The latest prices are $18 without a pass for Ship Brand, $17.60 for Chicken Brand, and $16 for other miscellaneous brands. Sales are weak, and a turnaround is expected after the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods. Longkou Vermicelli Rebounds by Fifteen Yuan.</h3>
<p>Vermicelli: Previously, the price of Longkou vermicelli had fallen from over $110 to $100 due to slow sales. Recently, the three firms specializing in this product have formed an alliance and stopped offering discounts, so the price has immediately tightened, rising to $115. The price of Qingdao vermicelli has also risen by $1 to $81.</p>
<h3>Hardware. Iron Products Hindered by Rain.</h3>
<p>Yesterday's torrential rain severely affected hardware transactions. Various iron products could not be shipped out, and the market was depressed. 200-pound U.S. steel wire was still priced at $160. 180-pound U.S. tinplate was still selling for $240, and 200-pound was priced at $260. Bamboo steel bars were priced at $1,150 per ton. Local steel nails were priced at $45. New plated nails were priced at $45. New zinc wire was priced at $85, and white zinc wire was priced at $70. Black iron sheets were priced at around $75. The price of billet goods was about $1,000 per 2,000 pounds. The price of American strip iron was between $130 and $140 per case, with prices but no sales.</p>
<p>Steel arrived in Shanghai from the U.S. on the Tampa, a ship from the U.S. Corporation managed, that arrived at the Hongshun Wharf, Hongkou last Saturday. There were a total of 5,000 tons of steel bars, steel plates, iron ingots, and galvanized iron. It is reported that a large quantity will arrive in Shanghai today.</p>
<p>Also, 866 blocks of angle iron arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.</p>

<h3>Pudong Riverside Rumors</h3>
<p>According to people on ships anchored in the Huangpu River in the Nanshi area of Shanghai, recently, from 11:00 PM every night, there is a sudden uproar and shouts, lasting until dawn, sometimes twice or three times, even with gunshots to add to the chaos. The reason for this is said to be that people on the ships see a ball of dark air coming with the wind, like a collapsing Mount Tai, sweeping away those sleeping soundly on the ships. Some say that three people were swept away from a certain ship, and others say two people were swept away from another ship, but no actual names can be identified. As a result, people are panicking and cannot sleep peacefully. The merchants and residents in the Nanshi area are all spreading these rumors, but wise people do not dare to believe them lightly.</p>
<p>Ancient Artifact Unearthed</p>
<p>Reprinted from Xin Bao Sixty-Seven Years Ago (469)</p>
<p>(See this newspaper from the 12th year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing dynasty)</p>
<p>Westerners greatly value ancient artifacts, and the cultural relics of Rome and Greece are said to predate those of other countries. Now, many ancient objects have been unearthed in that region, which people greatly treasure! Recently, it was heard that someone unearthed a bottle in Yesselik, with ancient characters on it that no one recognized. Li Fengbao, the observer of the Chinese mission to Germany, said that these were Chinese characters, and the year recorded was 3,000 years ago, stating that the bottle could contain three bolts of gauze. The Westerners were very happy, saying that ancient Greece and Rome had dealings with China in the past, and this bottle was purchased from China. However, some people suspect that this bottle was not transported from China, and wonder how the differences between Chinese and Western characters at that time can be known. The statement also makes sense.</p>

<h3>How Will the New World Arrive?</h3>
<p>Last time in this newspaper, we mentioned "We need a new world." We also said that the realization of this new world requires everyone to have a thorough understanding of sin and evil, and a determination to eliminate evil completely.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about how humanity can have a thorough understanding of sin and evil. Actually, this is not a problem. Because Mencius once said, "The heart of right and wrong is in everyone." If people have a sense of right and wrong, they will naturally know what is good and what is evil, what is in accordance with heavenly principles, and what is inhumane. What is there to realize or not realize? Unfortunately, people, for various reasons, such as pride, selfishness, or prejudice, often bury their conscience, shamelessly, harden their hearts, stubbornly refuse to repent, and act willfully. They completely disregard how much harm their words or actions will cause to others. If there are such people in a family, that family will not be peaceful. If there are such people in power in a country, not only will that country not be peaceful, but it will also harm other countries. When will humanity be able to accept the guidance of the conscience that God has given them, reform themselves, and become new people? That is when the new world will arrive.</p>
<p>Secondly, we should know that humans have weaknesses. Sometimes, when examining their conscience at night, they may have an understanding of sin, but they do not have the ability to overcome sin. For example, if you talk to a person who smokes opium about the harms of opium, they probably know more than you do. But as soon as you mention the words "abstain from it," they will "talk about other things." Why is this? This is human weakness! A saint in Christianity once lamented his own weakness, saying, "For to will is present with me, but how to perform that which is good I find not." (Romans 7:18) Later, at another time, he said, "I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me." (Philippians 4:13) Dear readers, if we want humanity to become new, if we want the world to become new, we must start with ourselves. Only Jesus can give you new strength. Do you believe?

<h3>The Cave Hospital</h3>
<p>— Weng Qiao</p>
<p>The twenty-three caves outside Xi'an, Shaanxi, are the newest type of hospital in this city. These caves are located in the square behind a Taoist temple, where neat grass and shrubs grown from root division provide the hospital with a lovely garden. Moreover, the thirty-foot-deep caves provide maximum safety for patients and equipment during bombing.</p>
<p>The Northwest Hospital, established by the Northwest Special Health Committee of the National Health Administration, certainly has its reasons for being cautious. Xi'an is only one hundred and sixty kilometers from the Yellow River front line, and it has been visited by Japanese planes several times. During the bombings in March, the Yanqing and Labosun Hospital, a church institution with a long history in the capital of Shaanxi Province, was bombed twice. As a result, the operating room and clinical professorship were destroyed. Later, the hospital moved to a church school outside the city, and the hospital was located in the caves to avoid suffering the same fate again.</p>
<p>The hospital has an annual budget of 130,000 yuan. It has an outpatient department and thirteen wards in Xi'an, all of which are in caves. The wards have one hundred beds, and another ten caves are used as clinical professorships and staff dormitories. New wards can be built in a short period of time when needed.</p>
<p>The hospital is divided into six departments: internal medicine, surgery, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, pediatrics, and obstetrics. There are twenty-one certified doctors here, some of whom have studied in the United States or the United Kingdom. In addition, there are thirty-four trained nurses.</p>
<p>The hospital began serving the community in September 1939. In the first three and a half months, a total of 14,989 patients were treated. Since this year, the outpatient department has had a total of 500 patients every day.</p>
<p>In the hospital, patients are completely free of charge. The only cost is the two-mao storage fee for the medicine bottle. The wards in the caves are very dry and have good ventilation. If the weather permits, patients can also go to the garden to enjoy more sunshine and the beauty of nature.</p>
<p>The operating room is located in the main hall of the temple. Most of the patients who come to the hospital for surgery are trachoma patients.</p>
<p>The hospital focuses its attention entirely on civilians, because there are many military hospitals near Xi'an that care for wounded soldiers.</p>
<p>Nature</p>
<h3>The Island's Spouse</h3>
<p>— Hu</p>
<p>I happened to see such a record in a magazine:</p>
<p>In the Guiana region, there is a bird called Tinamau. After the female lays an egg, she flies far away, leaving the responsibility of hatching the egg to the male. Often, before the first chick's feathers are strong, the female flies back from afar and lays another egg, forcing the father to shoulder the dual responsibility of hatching eggs and raising children, while the mother soars in the wilderness, living a leisurely life.</p>
<p>Conversely, in Europe, there is a bird called Hornbill. After the female lays an egg, she is imprisoned in a mud-built nest, leaving only a very small hole to receive food given by the male bird; she has no freedom at all.</p>
<p>This is what I wrote down based on my memory. The original text is certainly somewhat different from this, but I am confident that the content is not distorted. As for why I can remember it so clearly, it is because I felt that these two extremely different birds seem to contain a bit of educational meaning for us humans. Therefore, I also told this record to my friends, which aroused a lot of discussion among them.</p>
<p>In feudal society, the status of women has always been low. They are indeed like being "imprisoned" in houses by men; except for managing household affairs, there is no social interaction at all. However, since the eastward spread of European customs, some women have not only been liberated, but their status has even surpassed that of men, leaving all family responsibilities to their husbands, while they specialize in dancing, watching movies, and even having affairs with others. Just like the Tinamau mentioned earlier, they specialize in wandering outside, and the eggs jointly conceived with other birds must also be hatched and raised by their husbands. These phenomena all have the drawbacks of excess and inadequacy.</p>
<p>The most ideal couple should be on a position of mutual assistance, neither like Hornbill, which particularly restricts women's activities, nor like Tinamau, which completely entrusts responsibility to men. They should be like swallows, each doing their best and each taking on their responsibilities with their own strengths.</p>
<h3>Freedom</h3>
<p>— Sen Nian</p>
<p>What is freedom? It includes two points: (1) Understand the scope of your actions and abide by them. You must acknowledge that you have an independent personality and do not be afraid, jealous, or disgusted. (2) You must understand the environment in which you are located and do not be afraid, jealous, or disgusted. When you do this, you will gain freedom. ——Ann Bridge</p>
<p>Hawthorne's Investigation</p>
<h3>The Dancer's End</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Four Several Guesses</p>
<p>The tea waiter smiled again, half pushing and half accepting, and said, "Sir, you are too polite." In fact, the legal tender had already safely passed. "Sir, what exactly did this Mr. Qian do?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne said in a low voice, "He may have killed someone!" As he spoke, he paused, as if listening to something, and looked towards the west entrance of the aisle.</p>
<p>"Killed someone?" The attendant could not help but reveal a look of horror.</p>
<p>Hawthorne stopped him and said, "Keep your voice down! You can inform your colleagues that if they see him again somewhere, or if someone comes looking for him, you should send someone to follow them quietly. If you can report to me the address of him or his friend, I am prepared to reward you with ten similar legal tenders." As he spoke, he took out a card and gave it to him. "Here is my phone number, keep it."</p>
<p>When the tea waiter saw the card, a look of surprise suddenly appeared on his face. "Oh, you are Mr. Hawthorne—I—I will definitely do it—but it may not be easy to see him again."</p>
<p>Leisang nodded and said, "That doesn't matter, I have other ways to find him. Just do your best." After he finished speaking, he nodded to me, turned around and left.</p>
<p>I followed Hawthorne back to the front of the elevator room. The steel door of the elevator room was closed, and the indicator needle above was stopped on the first floor downstairs. I expected that it would take a considerable amount of time for this elevator to rise to the top and then descend again. Because of the gradual development of this case, I was really a little impatient, so I wanted to take advantage of this waiting opportunity to hear Hawthorne's views. (69)</p>

<h3>The Soul's Cry</h3>
<p>— Pin Pin</p>
<p>A person walking on the road of life often has to look back. Almost every step forward, they have to look back once. There is nothing particularly unforgettable in the past, but as they get closer to old age day by day, the disappearance of youth naturally causes melancholy, so they feel more and more that the past is lovely.</p>
<p>I can say that I am almost halfway through my life. I walk slower, my memory gradually fades, my hair is not as thick as it used to be, my eyes rarely flash with brilliance, and my conversation is as ordinary as others. I feel lonely because my close young friends are alienated from me, and I am replaced by a group of strangers without light and heat. I am wandering, and the road ahead seems to be blocked. I ask myself, "Is my life over like this, like a cicada at the end of summer?"</p>
<p>When I am moving, I can forget myself, but when I am quiet—for example, in the early morning when I wake up early, or during a rest after work—I can't help but question myself, "I have lost something!" I ponder, and ponder again, and finally discover what this lost thing is. The ambition of youth is lost!</p>
<p>In the past, I made hundreds of vows, participated in activities that were not too many or too few, competed with people for a countless number of times, and argued with my opponents until my mouth was dry. I laughed often... What about now? I don't make vows, like a stupid cow, I retreat, like an old horse, I retreat, I don't like competition, saying it has no meaning, I don't know where the ability to argue has escaped to; as for laughing, I have also lost its method, I only have sorrow.</p>
<p>I, who have lost my ambition, am very panicked, like a magpie being chased by a falcon.</p>
<p>The ambition of youth is necessary. Even if it brings errors or failures, if there is no ambition of youth, life is like winter. Although the efforts of my youth did not bring joy to me, I have no right to seek joy without them. What can I do now except look back?</p>
<p>Suddenly, the soul said to me, "Resurrect it! Preserve it!" I feel a burst of energy after hearing the soul's cry. People who are on the same road with me, you don't have to panic, there is still a spark of youthful ambition, just waiting to be fanned!</p>

<h3>About Tan Xinpei's Poems</h3>
<p>— Plum Blossom Pavilion Master</p>
<p>When Liang Rengong of the Ice-Drinking Studio lived in the old capital, he often interacted with people in the pear garden. He once wrote a poem on Tan Xinpei's embroidered portrait of a fisherman, which was widely recited by people in the capital at that time. When I first went to Ping in the autumn of the ninth year of the Republic of China, I saw this portrait and this poem, which were hung in the west side room of Yingxiutang. There was also a postscript by Luo Yinggong after the poem. When I went again later, I never saw this portrait again. The poem is a seven-character ancient poem, and I have a copy of it. The poem says: "Tan Xinpei is the only one in the world, his fame has thundered for thirty years. Now he is old and playing with the world, and he still has a handsome appearance to blow away the dust; the rain of art and the wind of reeds are rushing in the evening, and he entrusts his smoky hat to the depths of the Five Lakes. How many people in the world trade embroidery, wasting their songs and tears in the arena."</p>
<p>My family's Sea Collection Building Master Taiyi also liked to travel with actors in middle age. Among the poems given to actors, the most were obtained by Jin Yuemei, the master of Shuangqing Pavilion. Wang Lingzhu and Zhou Xinfang also gained quite a lot, but none of them were included in the collection. Among the ones occasionally seen in the collection, there is a seven-character poem given to Tan Yingxiu, entitled "Watching Little Jiao Tian Perform Peng Bei," which is quite sonorous and worth reciting. It cannot be abandoned because of the person, so it is recorded together.</p>
<p>"Yang Ye in his old age actually surrendered with his corpse, the fame of Yun Dai has been around for a while; what is the difference between breaking the enemy and chasing pheasants and rabbits? He once said to avoid banners when he saw the wind; late in life, he became an old relic of the Imperial Academy, and the dying hero has a handsome appearance; the frost and moon are full of dog ice and tears, and the dark wailing still surrounds the Li Ling Stele."</p>
<p>According to the intention of this poem, the focus is on the plot. The fifth and sixth sentences, "Late in life, he became an old relic of the Imperial Academy, and the dying hero has a handsome appearance," one writes about the status of the performer in the actor world, and the other writes about the attitude of the character on the stage; the last two sentences write about the wonderful sound and emotion of this play and the skill of the performance, combining the performer and the character in the play into one, which is enough to show Tan's in-depth transformation of imitating Yang Ye's voice and appearance.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I read an article entitled "Separate Records of the Pear Garden" written by the famous writer Yu Yuan, an old man from Xijin. It contains many poems about famous actors and plays during the Tongguang period. One of them is a poem about Tan's Zhuangyuan Genealogy, which says:</p>
<p>Ode to Tan Jinfu (i.e., Little Jiao Tian)</p>
<p>Zhuangyuan Genealogy (Anonymous)</p>
<p>"The knees are withered and desolate, and the declining years are often worried. I sigh that the descendants of the industry are lost, and I sigh that I was not born at the right time. I beg for the appearance of a quail, and sing about the ordinary with leisure. I patrol the eaves and cry, and I raise my staff and fill my chest with anger. Looking back to the other shore is urgent, and the ancestral grave is full of thick tears. I offer thin enjoyment to commemorate the time, and the relics are in Chongfeng. I return the wealth to the palm of my hand, and I must follow the teachings. One morning, I moved to the good quickly, and the eagle road flew into the sky." (Mei's note: This is a poem about the play, and it has nothing to do with Yingxiu.)</p>
<p>The original note says: Tan Jinfu's stage name is Xinpei. His father sang old female roles, and his voice was like the Jiao Tianzi bird, so he was nicknamed "Jiao Tianzi." Yingxiu's nickname is "Little Jiao Tian" for this reason. When Yingxiu was old, those who called him that could not bear to say "Little," so they simply said "Jiao Tian'er." Jinfu was his alias at a certain period.</p>
<h3>Germany's Film Blitzkrieg Tactics</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>The German army captured the small countries of Europe by means of lightning speed, and the world was shocked by her "blitzkrieg tactics." However, Germany's lightning method is not only in military affairs, but also in cultural films.</p>
<p>Originally, American films occupied a large market in various small European countries, and the German film industry had long regarded it as a thorn in its side. However, it had no way to compete with it, so it tried its best to endure and wait for a good opportunity. A few months ago, when the German army attacked Denmark and entered Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, on the very night, it immediately issued an order that all the cinemas in the city should show German-produced films to celebrate. The owners of the cinemas were all very panicked, because they only had American films on hand. Where did the German films come from?</p>
<p>At this moment, many German film merchants suddenly appeared with smiles on their faces. They brought a large number of newly made German copies and distributed them to various cinemas one by one. The owners were very surprised. In fact, the day before the German army entered Copenhagen, the German "film fifth column" had already received the news that Copenhagen would fall at a certain time, and they had brought a large number of films into the city in advance to make arrangements calmly. When the order was given, they would control everything. This method was also used once when they occupied Czechoslovakia. What is pitiful is that American films were banished from Denmark overnight, and the stars most loved by Danish young men and women, such as Clara Gable, Elol Flynn, and Diana Bo Ping, also said goodbye to them from then on, and their eyes were replaced by a group of unfamiliar faces that were not very welcome.</p>

<h3>How to Make a Movie? (7)</h3>
<p>— De Gang</p>
<p>(7) When watching a silent film with sound, you can only see people's lips moving, but you can't hear what they are saying. This is of course a big regret. In order to eliminate this regret, scientists invented sound films, bringing sound to the screen so that audiences can not only see, but also hear. The method of making sound films is to record various sounds, such as light words, music, singing, etc., together with the phonograph when filming, and then use a loudspeaker to release the recorded sound when showing the film. There is a difficulty here, which is that it is difficult to make the action and sound happen at the same time. In order to solve this difficulty, someone invented the use of two electric small motors, one for the film and one for the sound. Both motors are specially installed to make the action consistent, so that the film and sound can be emitted at the same time, and there will never be any discrepancies. In addition, there is also a latest type of sound film, the film of the image, which also has sound traces for sound emission at the same time. The color of the sound traces varies in intensity, which is exactly in line with the sound. When projecting, strong light passes through the sound traces and reaches an electric eye. Because the light has intensity, the electric eye generates electric waves, which then act on the loudspeaker, and the sound is emitted. The principle of this sound film is relatively complicated and cannot be described in detail in this article. ()</p>
