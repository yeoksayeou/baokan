<h3 id="c9">日本新閣趨勢的檢討 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>日本新閣的成立旣已旬日，首相米內光政除於十六日就職時，向日方新聞記者以談話方式略述施政方針，大體同於前閣；此外對於現階段的日本政局，米內究竟具有何等大經緯，尚無何種表示。其內閣陣容，亦與前閣相去不遠，泰半屬於中庸一流人物；社會與論，則毀譽參半，但大都致疑於新閣擔當艱局的能力，尤以軍部方面報紙表示最為露骨。日本流傳的諺語說：一個內閣的生命恒決定於組閣的時候；如果這話真是史實教訓中得來的真理，那麼，米內內閣的前途命運，也不會較比其前任者更好些吧。然而從旬日來的種種演進來看，則此一甫經成立的新閣也別有若干值得注意的特點。例如前此諸內閣成立之初。類多先事誇耀其偉大抱負，如平沼則標榜內外總親和，阿部則視解決中國事變為己任，用以邀取國民的期望與支持；此次米內獨未提出特殊政治信念只是蕭視曹隨，表示一切都蹈襲前閣方針，其穩重謙抑適與前此諸人的標榜浮誇，相映成趣，此其一。中日戰爭爆發之後，旣往三代首相均視軍事外交為其唯一使命，而關於一般內政問題則列為次要；原來日本人大多器小易盈，一朝際會風去，無不好大喜功，而以為目前在軍事外交方面，功勳可以一揮而就，其實卻是不揣本，不量力，遂致一誤再誤；這次米內所發表的大政方針中，則將內政與外交軍事並立為三，並有將於本日起，連續召開特別閣議三，專事研討內政難題之說；這種步調，難因為阿部內閣倒於內政，懲前毖後，急所先務；又因為議會集議在即，亟須安排應付；亦因為侵略兩年半，內在弱點太嚴重了；而近頃各方與情，尤渴望新閣有些辦法，但歷觀近衛平沼阿部登台之始，內政上儘多問題，卻大吹大擂於外交軍事，以移轉目標；作風自是不同。此其二。日本政局自經「五一五」事變後，政黨變成閒曹，間有一二黨人入閣，不是以個人資格參加，就是實之次要位置以為點綴；而在現閣中，則民政政友兩黨各有幹部代表二人入閣，最重要的藏相一席，且落在民政系的櫻內身上，形成四五年來政黨的空前景氣；而另一方面，炙手可熱的官僚勢力則在與論攻擊中大見衰退，未能佔得顯要地位。此其三。從這些逈異往昔的種種措置看來，足見米內當政在重大原則上難無所提示，無所興革，只以遵循近衛以來的傳統方針為能事，而在方式運用上則亟圖改絃易轍，先從彌縫補　的工作入手，以期衛破其前任遺下來的難關。這一方面自然由於今日日本的軍事外交均瀕絕境，除卻歌唱老調以支撐門面而外，更尋覓不出其他更有效的匡時良策，故不敢徒為虛聲大言以自欺欺人；另一方面也顯示出日本自身內部的種種危機，更日趨於具體化與表面化，再不容當局像平沼阿部那樣發揮其「官僚獨華」的作風去機械地運用，而漠視社會與民間的反響和艱困。</p>
<p>一般說來，米內施政的趨勢，大概將正和他本人個性一樣，多少帶些溫和色彩，這也正是元老重臣所以屬望於他的原故。平心論事，日本在八九年來確是需要溫和，事實上卻不幸之甚，尤自二三年來自誤於太不溫和；到了現在，所需不是溫和，而是大刀闊斧的悔禍與變計，事實上卻無此傑出的人物，於是惟有取之於溫和。因此之故，所謂米內的溫和也者，並不能修正其八九年來乃至二三年來的近衛傳統政策；而只是準備以溫和的面目，緩和內外各種矛盾和困難；俾使其侵華的軍事政治，以及獨占遠東的企圖，能夠比較柔順的遂行而已。其前途的重大障碍並不一定在軍部，因為這種路線並不與軍部的根本抱負相違，而且軍部對政府的控制力也並未較前削弱，亦即新閣在事實上依然受軍部的控制；可是今日的日本，根本上已非任何彌縫補　的手段所能濟事，正如任何人參鹿茸，溫補熱補，無法挽救一個垂死的病人一樣。侵華軍事的困頓，政治攻勢的無效，已趨僵局的美日關係，以及百億以上的龐大預算，在繼續惡化和表面化的通貨膨脹，空前困苦的人民生活與絕對缺乏的米炭及生產的必要物資，那一樣是醫頭醫脚的片面溫和政策所能挽救？在「七七」事變以前，如果這種溫和持重的主張能使銳意經營大陸的人們懸崖勒馬，還能避免一些將要到臨的危難；及至已鑄成大錯的今天，無論當局政策急進也好緩和也好，要是不能根本取消其積重難返的侵略路綫，終於一無是處。並且不拘米內內閣無論是否會在短期內遭遇失敗，他這種溫和政策的運用也不過是刹那間事；等到侵華軍事外交內政三方面都不能由溫和的攻勢收到功效之後，繼之而起的，必然會有更冒險更瘋狂的一幕，也就是崩潰的前一幕！</p>

<p>（海通社航訊）戰爭對幣制可發生影響、前次世界大戰後、政治活動之結果、關於幣制政策、演成兩大系統、一派主張幣制可以自由、一派堅持幣制應予限制、英國倡導前說、德國昌明後議、此番經過作戰政策之試騐、英鎊集團幾于瓦解、易言之、主張幣制自由之陣綫已潰散矣、數十年來、英鎊爲世界金融及匯兌之台柱、世界之鎖　、握於金鎊主人翁之掌中者久矣、前次世界大戰使此種優越之地位、初次感覺撼搖、英國之國債、由六萬萬五千萬鎊增至八十萬萬鎊、（海外英屬地之一萬萬二千八百萬鎊債款在內）戰前英國財政度支之結算、每歲盈餘、可得二萬萬鎊、最近數年之結算、不惟毫無盈餘、反而歲虧五千萬鎊以上、一九三一年、英鎊貶値後、其初似覺失利、終經證實其成功、尤以一九三三年、美金繼英鎊之後、亦形貶値、益顯英國政策得佔機先、貨幣眨値之結果、造成一種有利貿易發展之空氣、而英鎊之地位、益臻鞏固、於是倫敦在一九三七年、又爲世界金融之中心、</p>
<p>英國金融政策鼎盛之期、並不久長、近年英國政府開始振興軍備、勢須動用本國之資本、忽發現英國財政之結算、並無盈餘、祗有虧累、此種弱點、局外人初不知悉、但至去年、倫敦市中已有少數人、洞窺英國財政外强中乾之隱情展轉傳播、遂成爲公開之秘密矣、</p>
<p>此次歐戰、適逢英鎊衰弱之際、是以開戰僅數日、英鎊竟跌價百分之二十、幸賴政府速即規定幣制辦法、英鎊始不至繼續下跌、</p>
<p>一向屬於英鎊集團之國家、有不願隨英鎊之跌勢、而影響其國內經濟者、於開戰之初、即脫離該集團、除荷蘭及其屬地、去年已興英鎊分道揚鑣外、斯康地半島諸國於九月初脫離英鎊之集團、瑞典·挪威兩國首與美國金元發生聯繫、丹麥繼之、芬蘭·愛沙尼亞·及拉脫維亞均與英鎊脫蝠、而與瑞典之克郞相聯屬、於是英鎊在北歐、東歐及東南歐之勢力、均極衰微、其後日本與「滿洲國」均與英國金鎊脫離關係、英鎊集團至是幾干完全消滅、</p>
<p>英鎊集團之崩潰、具有重大之意義、不僅英國之幣制失敗、可謂英國之經濟失敗、蓋以幣制聯繫之斷絕、對於貿易關係、亦有重大之影響、英鎊眨値之結果、增加英國輸入品之價格與價値、同時英國在國外擁有之財產、其以英鎊爲依據者、價値亦隨英鎊而跌落、此又英國之不利也、</p>
<p>所有世界上之原料市塲、最近營業核算、均以美金代替英鎊、美國之金融力陡增、黃金及流動資本、均被美國吸收、美國擁有之黃金、其價値超過一千七百億（萬萬）金元、此美國金元勝利之明證也、</p>
<p>茲將十年來、英鎊集團團員之多寡、劃分四斯、列表于后、以資比較、（一）一九三一年終—十二國、英國·丹麥·芬蘭·冰烏·挪威·葡萄牙·瑞典·埃及·日本·伊朗·暹羅、（二）一九三四年終—十四國、增愛沙尼亞及「滿洲國、」（三）一九三八年中—十七國、又增法蘭西、拉脫維亞及荷蘭、（四）一九三九年十月—五國、祗餘英國·法蘭西·葡萄牙·埃及·及伊朗、</p>

<p>兒童就業諸多缺點</p>
<p>若幹兒童、業經收養機關代為覓得職業、但和該機關對於兒童就業後之環境、不加過問、事前亦未與雇主方面訂立合同、大多數兒童在小規模之家庭紡織業作工、前途無甚希望、雇主除供給低劣之膳宿外、不給報酬、有某雇主曾公然承認彼自收養機關、購得兒童、</p>

<p>— 朱博泉</p>
<p>本文共六節、計分（一）前言，（二）法幣發行，（三）外匯暗市，（四）債市，金市，股市，（五）銀錢業及同業匯劃暨尾聲、上期已刊出第一第二節、在第三節內又將外匯暗市之動態、述至去年六月底為止，茲續將外匯市情及第四節戰完：第五六兩節於下期續　、</p>
<p>七月上旬、財政部公布關於調整貿易，管理外匯之規章三種、規定（一）進口貨之並屬必要者，共若幹種，皆在禁運之例。（二）凡進口貨物經核准購買外匯後、由中交兩行照各該行掛牌之價供售，但應繳納法價與此項市價之平衡費；（三）凡出口貨物售得之外匯、應照法價售予國家銀行，由中央銀行給予相當於法價及中交掛牌價之差額。中交掛牌行市，大概低於法價，高於暗市，因上海情形特殊，故上項規章，殆未能一般的施行。</p>
<p>匯價自七月初降至六便士五之新水準後，除在銀錢業奉部令再度限制提存時一度放長外，此後一個多月中，市價相當穩定，而購買之風，則仍有增無減，蓋套取者因匯價暴縮，當時曾頗受打擊，而正惟其曾打擊，故耽心今後變化，隨時購求不斷，投機者復靡然從之。至七月初旬，有華北法幣大量運滬，對外匯市場形成又一壓力，於是匯豐掛牌，在七月十七日至廿四日之一星期中，自六便士半，步步猛縮，至四便士之新價，人心浮動，投機之風益烈。至八月五日，謠傳政府在國外訂印大量紙幣，匯價即日暴低至三便士二五，旋經政府聲蝗謠傳之不確，人心稍定。八月下旬，為歐洲大戰之前夕，如德波交涉之決裂，蘇德商約之訂下，及英法兩國各種戰時經濟措置之發表，消息傳來，匯市頓見松動。</p>
<p>第三時期為歐戰發生一以至年底，九月一日，英法政府宣佈與德國間成立戰時狀態，至九月二日，暗市匯價放長至四便士以上，雖其後因滬西時局和平謠言等等屢次緊縮，而因下述各種原因，故大勢終屬堅挺。自十月二十七日昨工至五便士以上，以迄十一月廿四日止，匯價輒在五便士以上，最高之價，為五便士五六二五。其後稍回軟至五便士以內，而市平穩，盤旋於四便士半左右，耶誕前後，復見松動。吾人觀察四個月來匯價放長之故，主因五：</p>
<p>（一）為歐戰所引起之資金逃避。歐戰發生後，英政府聲明對英鎊國際價格擬不予以維持，海外英匯放長，同時英國遠東各屬地先後貨幣統制，香港復有所得稅之開徵，華僑資金紛紛流歸上海，但上海英匯固跌，而美匯亦跌，惟所跌視英匯略少耳。（二）為進口減少。查上海進口貨，自九月份起，業已減少，約全國幣一萬九千四百萬元，十月份銳減，約九千二百五十萬元，十一月份復見減少，約七千八百三十萬元，同時出口貨物略見松動，九月份約六千七百萬元，十月份約入超約一千八百餘萬元、至十一月份出超約一千四百餘萬元，實為向來所未有。惟吾人應加注意者：出口貨物中農產物等，已非國人所經營，而棉張江棉織物等，亦大部份非國人所自造。至進口減少出口增加之原因，泰半山於六月後匯價之減少出口增加之原因，泰半山於六月後匯價之減低，兩者固互為因果，當局談話中所稱「合於有利中國經濟之標准」者，其歷三月始顯；歐洲戰事，則其另一原因也。（三）匯價低落後，所謂套買方面者，以各種方法搜得法幣所可獲得之外匯，已大大打一折扣。而彼方對於法幣自身，有時常有甚大之需要。即如今秋農產豐收，凡向戰區內收買棉花或食米，均需法幣，當時在市上出售外匯以換法幣者，乃即為平時套買不絕之某方，其頗多矛盾，可以概銅陵。（四）投機者之購買，顯已減少。歐戰影響外匯者如彼，貿易狀況如此，而長沙及其他各地捷報頻來，在謠言最多之外匯暗市中，又如熱病之人，初投清涼之劑，觀　近來情形，大抵獲利出籠者有之，忍痛結束者亦比比而定，雖有待機　動之願望，其意志不如昔日之雄豪而專一。（五）一般的商業信念，下半年中逐漸恢復，由於對私人財富作打算而購買者，近來恐屬無多。</p>
<p>吾人尚有應行注意之一點，即許多外匯論者，　謂八月後之數次回漲時，匯兌平準會常酌量收買，使市價變化比較緩和，故　八月至今暗市價格·倘無平準會之買進、其回漲尚不祇此。</p>
<p>四，國債暗市現金暗市及外商股票市場</p>
<p>外商股票市場</p>
<p>（甲）國債暗市　戰後華商證券交易所奉令停業，內國公債之買賣，亦係暗市交易，上年因滬市遊資增加，此項暗市交易，日趨活潑，本年雖經過數次變動，而為時甚暫，一年之中，大致平穩，惟公債之買賣，其投機性質及熱鬧情形皆遠不如外匯與現金，未能等量齊觀。</p>
<p>本年一月十五日，財政部聲明戰區海關稅收，已被判持，各該關應　應解之國債本息，由政府透支墊付者，已積至一萬七千五百萬元之钜，戰前各長期債務以關稅為擔保者，此後將不再拍墊付，消息傳來，各債驟跌六元有餘，旋一月底到期公債本息，仍由中中交三行以法幣照付，惟改基重慶付款，上海之執票人可向三行分六個月領取，人心稍定，市價回堅，六月十三日，曾漲至戰後之新高峯。</p>
<p>六月十九日，距外匯暴縮後未逾旬日，而國債本息停止支付之消息接踵而來，同時復有限制提存之舉，債市飄搖，市價連跌，暗市於六月二十日起暫停交易，於七月四日始行恢復，不久中中交三行承做公債到期本息票之貼現，分六期以同業匯劃支付、市況復稱，九月以後，國內戰事，屢有好音，而同業匯劃制度新經改善，貼水下降，市價趨堅穩，吾人回憶一年之中，金融市面變動之多，　蕩之劇，謠言之盛，雖八一五時無以過之，而綜觀一年來內國公債市價格，其表面之數字上，雖略低於上年，但自還付本息手續變更，實際收益，隨之而異，就子母比例計算市價，實亦無甚遜色，蓋國債信用之優良，滬市民眾對政府之信任，於此可見一斑矣。</p>
<p>（乙）現金暗市　自上年三月後，外匯暗市活躍，現金市場亦復活，五月間因受政府實行外匯管理，現金暗市價格，逐步上漲，至十一月而漲至每十兩二千元以上，本年上半年中，因現金籌碼缺乏，及華北方面一般的收買，市價繼續漸升，自六月七日外匯猛縮後，買風愈盛，殷富人士及投機者流，分其對外匯之信念與興味，以崇拜黃金，市價遂有飛黃騰達之觀，新高價之步步現現，幾為常事，至七月十八日突破三千元關口，至二十一日達四千六百元，其後雖經加跌，復狂漲至四千八百元，實為最高紀錄，其後雖於九月初因歐洲戰事，於十一月底因財部公佈禁止黃金存押條例，先後兩度下降外，至十二月一日後，又漲至四千元以上，良以上海環境特殊，雖明知收藏有違禁令，且抵押之門亦已關閉，而買賣與投機，依然如故，全年黃金市價，大致隨外匯而升降，與國際黃金市價情形，並不十分脗合。</p>
<p>（丙）外商股票　各種外商股票債票，向在英商眾業公司為買賣，種類頗多，銀錢業之證券購置，國債以外，此項外股亦其一種，戰後交易減少，去年漸有起色，今年六月間匯市方面發生變化後，外股交易日繁，歐洲戰起，尤予各種事業以刺激，各種實業股橡皮股及公用事業等等，市價均有一般的上漲，其買賣情形，要不如匯市金市之普遍而當投機性也。</p>
<h3 id="c78">日美經濟依存性之比較 <a href="#c78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— 任之</p>
<p>日美經濟依存性問題的檢討，不僅在日美高約不續訂而於本月二十五日正式失效後雙方經濟上將發生怎樣的狀態？就是對於目前擱淺的日美會談，也具有很重要的意義。因為相互間經濟依存性的強弱，是決定商約談判所取態度的一個最重要的因素。</p>
<p>所謂經濟依存性，如果依常識來說，那末國際經濟和個人經濟一樣，如甲方賣給一方一百，乙方也賣給甲方一百，則甲乙兩方的經濟依存關係是半斤和八兩。倘使甲方賣給乙方的，僅及乙方賣給甲方的一半，則甲方對乙方的經濟依存性也只是乙方對甲方的一半吧了。但是，這是常識的想法。事實上，雙方交易的商品，對於對方的重要程度有不同，雙方輸出品生產，對於本國國民經濟上所佔地位也各異，所以僅這樣從數量上推斷的依存性，是不能認為妥當的。</p>
<p>賣給對方的商品，在對方是否絕對需要？是否有代用品可以代用？對方從第三國也可以買到？再則，這種輸出商品的生產事業，在生產國的國民經濟上所佔地位是否重要？必須把這些問題一併加以考慮，才能夠正確地把握住雙方的經濟依存性。</p>
<p>貿易數量比較</p>
<p>日本對美的經濟關係，是處於钜大的入超地位。一九三四至三八這五年間，日本對美輸出總額為二十六億元，由美輸入總額為四十五億元，五年間入超十九億元，也就是，日本對美貿易輸出輸入，是四與九之比。同時這五年內，美國辦際貿易的出超總額為七十二億元，對日出超佔總額的百分之二十七。所以常識地說來，日本是美國的分之二十七。所以常識地說來，日本是美國的好主顧，似乎未便輕易放棄的；或則美國睚陷於不景氣的時候，或則對日輸出品僅限於日本需要而不是其他國家所需時，倒也使美國不無留戀的。但是這裏有兩個重大的事實已使美國對日本市場掉首而去，毫無可戀，第一是在日本方面，因為他這幾年來，特別是侵華戰爭發生以來，輸入能力已逐年減低著；而日本的出品，又非美國所歡迎或必需。第二是日本以外的國家對美國商品的需要正逐漸增加，尤其在歐戰發生後，英法諸國向美國定貨的更加擁擠。因此，美國對日的經濟依存性，可說已不復存在。</p>
<p>再把日本對美貿易，分為輸出與輸入而作個別觀察時，則即使以一九三七年日本由美輸入的最高紀錄來說，在美國的對外輸出總額中，也只佔百分之九·八而已。至於對美輸出，最近五年間在美國輸入總額中，僅為百分之六·四至七·四之間而已。由此可知美日通商關係到總額的十分之一。反之，從日本方面看來怎樣？日本對美輸出在日本輸出總額中所佔地們，一九三七年為百分之二六·五，一九三八年為百分之四〇·二。這等於說，美國對於日本，作為市場則其有四分之一的重要性，作為物資供給者則具有十分之四；地位之重要可知。</p>
<p>貿易品別比較</p>
<p>上面只從日美貿易的數量來觀察，結果已顯示著日本經濟絕對地依存於美國，而美國卻毋用依存於日本。如果再檢視雙方貿易品在對方經濟活動上的重要性，及其輸出品生產在本國國民經濟中的重要程度。那末彼此的利害關係，更可一目瞭然。</p>
<p>日本輸至美國的主要商品，以生絲為大宗，其次為罐頭食品，陶磁器，紡織品，玩具，植物油，除　菊，茶葉，　子，樟腦等。而這裏面，除了生絲每年達三億遠左右外，其餘都只是數百萬元而已。而且這些物品，完全沒有一樣是屬於絕對必需品的，而佔著最重要地位的生絲又正是奢侈品。這就是說，日本對美國輸出品，對於美國並非必要。如能拒絕他的進口，正是美國經濟的利益，可是這些輸出品的生產，在日本國民經濟中卻佔著非常重要的地位；特別是生絲，在全日本有一千萬以上的人口是從事育蠶及制絲而生活著的，並且這生絲的百分之九十以上是專為輸往美國而生產的。所以只要美國禁止日本絲的進口，日本的國民經濟生活便要發生極度的動搖。而在美國，保損之有？反之：若觀察美國輸往日本的商品，那正是日本在戰時經濟體制的血液。據柏林景氣研究所的調查，日本最近的輸入貿易中，軍需品幾佔半數。何況直接的軍火　不列入關冊的哩！（單位百萬日元）</p>
<p>一九三六年　一九三八年</p>
<p>輸入總額　二、七六四　二、六六三</p>
<p>軍需　六六〇　一、二四七</p>
<p>其他　二、一〇四　一、四一六</p>
<p>日本由外國輸入的軍需，已佔全部輸入貿易的一半。如將關岫以外的合計，那更見其佔著壓倒的多數。至於這些軍需輸入總額中，由美國輸入的究佔怎樣地位？關於這點，姑引日人小島精一的話。他在今年十一月號「日本重工業」雜誌上就這樣說著：「……從國防資源的海外供給上看來，美國佔著最重要的地位。實際上，有關國防的商品的海外輸外額中，有一半以上是由美國輸入的。而且其種類又極多，自石油（一億數千萬圓），屑鐵（八千萬至一億圓），銅（三、四千萬元）等重要的軍需工業原料，以至機械，汽車，飛機等（各數千萬圓）高度科學制品為止，樣樣都有輸入，所以從國防經濟的見地上說來，美國是特別需要注意發生前的材料，美國輸日軍需時就已佔各國輸日軍需總額的一半以上。戰事發生後，雖然日本已沒有這類數字的公表。可是由日本全體輸入能力的減縮，和軍需的需要增加這二種事實看來，美國輸日軍需品在美國對日輸出品全體中所佔的比率，一定比中日戰事發生前更大。同時，自從歐戰發生後，其他國家輸至日本的軍需品縱然不全部斷絕，但激烈地減少是無可疑義的；所以益發增加美國軍需品的輸入量，也是必然的事。所以在中日戰事以來，美國的對日軍需輸出，無論在相對和絕對的數量上，都含有更顯著的增加。這裏，已可以明白，以軍需為主的美國對日輸出品，在性質上對於戰時日本是絕對重要。那末這種對日輸出，在美國國民經濟上是否重要？這事可給以否定的答覆。因為自從歐戰發生以後，英法等國的美國定購軍需品的電報，像雪片一般飛來，美國的軍需工業大有應接不暇的樣子；所以日本買不買美國軍需品（事實上是非買不可）和美國對日輸出不輸出，在美國已屬無足重輕的事。這點上，可以知道美國對日輸出品的生產，在美國經濟上一點也不重要。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>總括說來，日美經濟依存性，無論在數量上，在實質上，美國依存於日本的極少；但是日本，尤其在戰時今日的日本，卻非依賴美國不可。而日本經濟依存美國的這種情形，正是美國貫澈他國際正義感的有力武器，也是奠定遠東公正和平與保障歐美在元東的一切權益與地位的有力武器；所以美日商約的續訂與否？是美國正議感的試金石。美國既不廢除該約來表揚他的正義感於前，所以除非日本放棄侵略，美日商約的續訂問題，前途是異常悲觀的。</p>

<p>自外匯劇變以來，顔料已成一大問題，漂白成本，亦加四倍以上，造紙業與染織業家，問計於予，　爲探討如次：吾國本爲黃種，素尙黃色，天子衣黃，后妃則綠衣黃裏，綠爲麻之本色，所用黃裏，大抵天子之敝衣耳。吾人嘗以長衣之面改爲夾裏，雖破裂補綴亦復無碍。戲劇表演，則勳臣衣紅，宰官衣藍，賤役衣黑，大都服色之別，係就原料產量之多寡而定限制；於紙亦然，尊則用黃，吉則用紅，輕喪用藍，重喪用白，由此觀之，足見黃爲正色，黃與紅間爲赭，是爲梔茜之染色，故史遷貨殖傳，有梔茜千畝，可以致富之說也。黃梔子與茜草，均爲野生植物，因無人種，故物稀爲責，及旣貴爲天子王臣之專用品，亦即用之者少，毋庸多種，而種千畝者富，蓋由富人之需求耳。書用黃麻，亦惟天子之詔，因麻可以爲衣，故不許其濫用，麻經漚熟，即可用碱浸軟，搗之成練，詩經所謂東門之池，可以漚麻，詞牌所謂胡搗練，即其製法，大抵搗練細密，始於胡服，而吾國麻衣，本非精製，故孝子乃有斬衰之制，示不求其精美，但不敢於毀傷遺體而已。麻經搗練，則其色轉灰白，而非正色之黃，故以梔子染之，使成赭黃，若以茜草染之，則變爲紅，亦可以舊黃衣加茜染而成赭，戲劇中之徐策，即是赭衣，大抵爲御賜黃衣所改染，以別尊卑者也。若夫藍色，則蓼藍遍地皆有，遇　成藍，遇酸成紅，紅藍相間，則成紫色，故諺有云：脫却藍衫換紫袍，蓋其尊卑亦差一級矣，紅黃藍之疊色，則變爲黑，世稱玄靑，實即黑也；黑爲水色，積藍多耳，玄爲天色，亦同此理；草木之色皆然，葉綠素即藍黃之間色耳。故吾以爲家與國之崇儉禮制，大抵一絲一縷，來處不易，君以賜臣，由黃而赭，由　而紅，由紅而紫，是即由梔茜而下及蓼藍，凡爲紅黃間色皆稱熱色，是太陽之日光，故男性之好動者喜之，以其性相近也。趨向於藍，則爲冷色，是太陰之月光，故女性之好靜者喜之；而白衣秀士，則以窮不能染，惟用本色以取淸潔而已，初非必如今之漂白者也。土布漂白，本由久晒，故晒濕布於草上，利用草因日晒，放出養分，以减色素中所含之輕，宜紙即由久晒而白，初非刻意求其白也；不及操作，久露於外致然，霜草變白，即明證也。吾人舊日所着之藍竹布衫，久晒即漸褪色而白，尤爲題證。　藍製靛，木爲我國通行之法，惟因日晒褪色，故爲洋靛所奪，洋靛能不褪色，即由炭輕化合作用，不復能受養化，因含油性，能不溶解於水，故其色素能以固定，今染色者用太古油，即取油性與鐮性化合，能抗酸也。其實，我國本有明礬媒染之法，亦不褪色，造紙家用　子以造建黃，亦以此爲小傳之秘。</p>

<p>報載『去年高考，與試者成績平凡，國文之技術極劣，思路不淸，本國歷史地理尤多意外之笑話。………益覺已往中學敎育凌亂而不切實，大學敎育驚新而不培本，似有釐訂修正之必要。至一般知識先進，指導靑年，尤須嚴格，不可徇俗忘本。』</p>
<p>這個「技術極劣」，這個「不淸」，這個「笑話」而且「意外」，與試者之恥，也是做學生時代的「忘本」所造成的，學生「忘木」，而敎員「而不培本」，這就有意想所料得到的笑話鬧出來了。</p>
<p>要此後的「本」培起來，不能不愛惜區區寒假的光陰，縱或短促，至少可讀一兩卷書。</p>
<h3 id="c92">怎樣利用漫長的寒假 <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— 直之</p>
<p>在忙過一陣攷試之後，學校中便來一個二三星期的寒被，可給予每個靑年學子們相當長時間的休息機會，但是，我們究將怎樣來利用和消磨此漫長的寒假呢？因此，我便提出了下面的計劃，貢獻給大家作爲一個參攷。</p>
<p>第一：利用原有書本，再加一番檢討和硏究的功夫。我們知道，書本是要多讀多溫習的，在平日，大家因爲限於學校訂定課程進度表上的工作起見，每個星期終有好幾門的功課，每門功課又終必換上好幾課的新書，做敎師的雖循序漸進的往下敎，然而學生們却苦於難求每課皆熟讀和細細的攷量硏究的機會，何况再加以目下讀書環境的惡劣和日常生活的不安定，自然更减少了學生們勤硏效求的努力上進的時間和空間性。但是，書終必是要多讀以後才能獲得益處，智識又必在融會貫通以後方見增長，我們旣然在平時沒有好多時間來溫習，那麼對於漫長的寒假，便屬我們利用了再加一番檢討和硏究的最好時候了。</p>
<p>第二：組織消寒會，從事集團生活的體騐。本來，人是不能離羣而索居的，社會就是我們人類合某組合的結果，那麼對於團體生活的養成，就得從小訓練起來。這樣在寒假裏，苟邀集了志同道合的數人，相互居處，以共切磋和磨礪，豈不是一個最好美滿的人生樂境嗎。因爲在這裏面，旣可有各種正富的娛樂，又可以磨練我們辦事的能力，更可得提高個人志氣和人格的培養。當然對於什麽讀書會呀，球類硏究會呀，話劇團呀，思想和信仰的訓練並糾正等，都可一一成立組織起來。</p>
<p>第三：體騐社會，養成服務的習性，靑年學生們，平日旣因忙於學校內的功課起見，實不容再有多暇以練習服務社會工作的習性，然而，人生來就得踏進社會去服務的，不過是人生服務社會時間的遲早罷了，那麽我們爲了將來立身處世的得有豐富的經騐和能勝任愉快起見，此刻便當開始體騐起來。現在，當此漫長的寒假中，大家旣有二三星期放假的時間，社會上又設有靑年會等給予學生聯絡和服務社會，服務羣衆的許許多多事業，我們便當勇敢地參加進去，並且更要細心負責地努力幹去。這樣，現在的訓練成熟，以後就是米來個人服務社會的成功，也即創建偉大事業的基礎。</p>
<p>總之，在上海今日的環境下，學生們的處境誠已極感沉悶的了，現在又屆臨了漫漫長夜，終日肅瑟的寒假，大家將怎樣的安渡過去呢，這的確是値得攷慮的問題，因此我提貢上面的」些消寒計劃，當然，其他的工作，尙有許許多多，只要大家在不喪志氣，不傷害身體，不違背妨害羣衆的目標下，努力而且愉快的幹去好了，光明即在目前。</p>

<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第二十回　世界交通同文共語　兒童敎育獎學憐才</p>
<p>怎樣的交換敎師呢？便是歐美的敎師派到中國來，中國的敎師派到歐美去。歐美敎師派到中國來的很多了，不必去說他。中國敎師派到歐美去的，近來也逐漸增多。木來因交換敎師，而中國學者在歐美大學校當敎師的也有。但這班講師，都是深通歐美語言文字，他們把中國固有的學問，傳達到各國去。說的還是外國文，寫的還是外國字，把中國語文經一度傳譯而已。現在交換敎師以後，歐美學生也請求敎他們中國語言文字的。爲什麽呢？這班學生，便是有志於到東方來的，有志於到中國來的，他們在國內有了一點兒中國語言文字的基礎，那就便當多了。五十年前，見到一冊英文的敎科書，它其中也有講到中國的一課。敎科書裏，因爲使學生易於瞭解，總是有揷圖的。揷圖中畫了中國一位聖人孔夫子，和他的門弟子。那孔夫子却穿了滿洲制服的朝珠袖褂，外套暖帽，腦後還拖了一條辮子。把孔夫子裝扮得如此模樣，眞使人有披髪左袵之歎。然而在畫師以爲中國人就是如此，孔夫子是中國人，應該如此打扮，這不是很合於論理學嗎。這便是西方人不瞭解中國的歷史風俗呀！還有一位美國傳敎師，在蘇州傳敎，他也學得了好幾句蘇白。他居然自己上小菜塲，這種外國人的强蘇白，蘇州人也可以勉强聽得懂。但他到了一個賣鷄的攤上，他便問道：「倷鷄是男個？還是女個？」賣鴹人茫然了，什麽男個女個，後來一想，不覺大笑，原來他是問雄的？還是雌的？因說：「洋先生！鷄是講雌雄，不講男女的。」小菜塲上人聽了，也都笑起來了。傳敎師方纔明白，鷄是應該稱雌雄，不該稱男女的。可是他又不服起來，中國書上，以及別地方人的口中，也稱爲　公鷄母鷄。旣可稱爲公鷄母鷄，爲甚的不能稱爲男鷄女鷄呢？中國的語言文字，眞是玄秘得很咧。其實這並不是玄秘，却是變化，就是歐美各國的語言文字中，也有許多變化，讀外國文的人，全都明白。就因爲他們比較的言文一致，而一國的疆域頗小，不能像中國的方言繁雜，這因爲中國地大人衆的緣故。　（二三〇）</p>

<h3 id="e8">The Contents of the Agreement Between Wang Jingwei and the Japanese Side are Announced in Hong Kong by Gao Zongwu and Tao Xisheng <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong: It is rumored that the conditions of the agreement signed in Shanghai on December 30th of last year between Wang Jingwei and the Japanese side have been announced today by Gao Zongwu, the former Director of the East Asia Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Tao Xisheng, a former member of the Central Committee, in a joint letter to the Dagong Bao newspaper. It has been learned that Gao and Tao had already broken with Wang over the organization of the "New Central Government" last week, and news of their departure from Shanghai had spread. According to the letter, Gao and Tao were shocked by the excessive demands made by Japan in the agreement and obtained a photographic copy. Due to the seriousness of the situation, the two took it to Hong Kong. One copy has been submitted to the National Government in Chongqing. The letter stated that the conditions were even more harsh than the notorious Twenty-One Demands, and in effect, reduced China to a Japanese vassal state. The agreement included the following articles: (1) China recognizes "Manchukuo;" (2) General cooperation between China, Japan, and "Manchukuo;" (3) Economic cooperation; (4) Establishment of a common front to resist Communism; (5) Designation of North China and Mongolia as "Special Areas" for defense and economic development purposes; (6) Japan's economic superiority in the lower Yangtze River and the supreme position of certain islands along the South China coast, including Xiamen and Hainan. Other key points of the agreement included Japan's right to station troops in North China, Mongolia, the Yangtze River basin, and designated islands in South China. Japan reserves the right to demand and supervise railways, aviation, postal services, telegraphs, major seaports, and waterways in the areas where Japanese troops are stationed. The number of Chinese troops in these areas must be reduced to the absolute minimum. The agreement further stipulates that after the establishment of the "New Central Government," it will compensate Japan for losses suffered in China since the start of the war. It also stipulates that China, Japan, and "Manchukuo" should sign agreements on the development of customs duties, trade tax sources, aviation, transportation, postal services, telephones, astronomy, and general surveying. China will grant Japan special interests and facilities to develop and utilize the resources of China, Mongolia, and other regions. Japan will appoint advisors to join the agencies of the "New Government" in certain designated areas and hopes that China will adopt appropriate tax and customs systems to promote trade between China and Japan. According to the agreement, China and Japan will cooperate to rebuild "New Shanghai." The letter stated that the draft of this agreement was handed over by Kagesa in the Liusan Garden in Shanghai on December 12th of last year to Zhou Fohai, Mei Shiping, and Tao Xisheng. Subsequently, Kagesa convened a meeting of his cadres to discuss the agreement. Gao Zongwu was shocked by the excessive demands made by Japan and made a photographic copy of the agreement. The letter concludes by stating that Wang was coerced by Japan and finally signed this agreement on December 30th. (Reuters Telegram dated 21st)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Gao Zongwu and Tao Xisheng announced that the agreement already signed with the Japanese side includes: (Essentials for Adjusting the New Sino-Japanese Relationship), consisting of six articles; (Principles for Adjusting the New Sino-Japanese Relationship), consisting of five articles; (Key Points for Adjusting the New Sino-Japanese Relationship), consisting of twenty-two articles; (Appendices to the Essentials for Adjusting the New Sino-Japanese Relationship), consisting of twenty-one articles. In addition, there is (What is Urgently Hoped from the Japanese Side Before the Establishment of the New Government) submitted by Wang, consisting of six articles, and a reply from the Japanese side, consisting of five articles. The original text of each document is quite lengthy. (Telegram dated 21st)</p>
<p>Gao and Tao Publish an Open Letter</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Gao Zongwu and Tao Xisheng sent a letter to the Dagong Bao on the 21st, stating, "To the esteemed reporter, Zongwu and Xisheng are mere scholars with no special talents, but since receiving education from a young age, we have heard of the great righteousness of loving our country and believe that citizens should sacrifice everything to serve the nation. Since the breakdown of relations between China and Japan, we have been running around for national affairs, adhering to this principle. Since the outbreak of the war of resistance, we privately believed that the Japanese side must not lack remorse for their mistakes and that the war should eventually have a path to end. If the purpose of the war of resistance can be achieved and our sovereignty and territorial integrity can be maintained, then we may achieve the same goal through different paths. Therefore, regardless of outside criticism, we were willing to dedicate our humble selves to serve the country. In the summer of last year, Zongwu was invited by Mr. Zai to go to Tokyo together, where we saw that the opinions of that country were complicated, the warlords were arrogant, and it was rare to expect them to wake up. After returning to Shanghai from Japan, we still painfully participated in the negotiations between the Japanese and Wang sides, hoping to remedy the situation in case of emergency. We recorded all the important points at any time. On November 5th, Kagesa personally handed over the Essentials for Adjusting the New Japanese-Chinese Relationship to Zhou Fohai, Mei Shiping, and Xisheng at the Liusan Garden. It was submitted by Mr. Wang to his highest-level cadre meeting, in which Wu also participated. We realized that the conditions were harsh, not only more so than the Twenty-One Demands of the fourth year of the Republic of China, but more than doubled, and very different from the so-called Konoe Statement. It directly wanted to subjugate our country into a vassal state and control our country's lifeline, which was extremely heartbreaking and infuriating. We could not resist but secretly photographed and stored them to see what would happen later. During that time, Japanese military men looked around and ordered us to accept, or used flowery words and shed tears. Mr. Wang was deeply lost and also made concessions and promises. Afterwards, on December 30th, the signature was signed. Wu and Sheng believe that this is related to the survival of the country and can no longer be ambiguous, so we took the various items on the boat and left Shanghai. When we left Shanghai, we asked someone to notify the Japanese side and told them that this kind of peace plan was unacceptable to anyone of the Republic of China. After arriving in Hong Kong, we sent letters and telegrams to Mr. Wang and others, urging them to rein in at the precipice and not be deceived and exploited by the Japanese warlords again, in order to achieve both public and private interests. In addition to sending the photographed and copied items to the National Government, we now send the entire photographic copy of the original text of the Japanese-Chinese New Relationship Adjustment Essentials and its annexes (with translation attached), as well as the Japanese side's letter on (What is Hoped for Japan Before the Establishment of the New Government) and the Japanese side's reply to the same item. Please disclose this matter immediately to your newspaper so that everyone can know it and not let the truth be hidden for a long time, to the point where it cannot be saved. Furthermore, in the second annex to the Japanese-Chinese New Relationship Adjustment Essentials, under the item regarding the principles of joint defense, there are seven articles in total. The fourth and fifth articles were not listed in the original Japanese text because the original text of these two articles was considered by the Wang side to be revised and temporarily revised by Itagaki and instructed Kagesa to orally dictate to Mr. Zhou Longxiang to record. Now, we correct the translation of the recorded text, especially to make it clear that we do not want to use this to seek understanding from the government and the people, but only to express our original intention of advocating peace. We cannot express all our meanings in words. Zongwu and Xisheng respectfully send our best regards, the 21st." "Also, Gao Zongwu and Tao Xisheng sent a joint letter to the Dagong Bao today, in which they explained the conditions of the negotiations between Wang Jingwei and the Japanese side. The letter briefly stated that Wu and Sheng were shocked by the harshness of the conditions and immediately photographed several copies of the original manuscript and brought the printed copies to Hong Kong. At the same time, a copy was also sent to the National Government in Chongqing." (Telegram dated 21st)</p>
<p>Rumor Has It That Wang Jingwei Arrived in Qingdao Yesterday</p>
<p>Qingdao: According to news obtained by Reuters, Wang Jingwei arrived here today. Wang Kemin and Liang Hongzhi may also arrive within a day or two. The conference on establishing a "New Central Government" is expected to be held around January 23rd and will last for a week. Wang's whereabouts are extremely secret. The strictest military precautions have been taken here. All villagers coming to Qingdao must be searched. Officials claim to be unaware of Wang's arrival. This morning, Chinese newspapers mentioned this conference for the first time, only stating that the conference will be held at the end of January and will discuss the fate of the "New Central Government" and various special administrative regions, as well as various issues related to Mongolia.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e9">A Review of the Trends of the New Japanese Cabinet <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>It has been ten days since the formation of the new Japanese cabinet. Prime Minister Mitsumasa Yonai briefly outlined his policy direction to Japanese journalists in a talk on the 16th, which was largely the same as the previous cabinet. Apart from this, there has been no indication of what grand strategy Yonai has for the current stage of the Japanese political situation. The lineup of his cabinet is also not far from that of the previous cabinet, with most of the members being mediocre figures. Public opinion is divided, but most people doubt the new cabinet's ability to handle the difficult situation, with the newspapers of the military expressing the most blatant doubts. A Japanese proverb says: the life of a cabinet is always determined at the time of its formation. If this saying is a truth derived from historical lessons, then the future fate of the Yonai cabinet will not be better than that of its predecessors. However, looking at the various developments over the past ten days, this newly formed cabinet also has some noteworthy characteristics. For example, in the early days of the establishment of previous cabinets, they often boasted of their great ambitions, such as Hiranuma promoting internal and external harmony, and Abe seeing the resolution of the China Incident as his responsibility, in order to win the expectations and support of the people. This time, Yonai alone did not put forward any special political beliefs, but simply followed the previous cabinet's policies. His stability and humility contrast with the boasting and exaggeration of his predecessors, which is one point. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the past three prime ministers have regarded military diplomacy as their only mission, while general domestic issues were listed as secondary. Originally, most Japanese were easily complacent and fond of taking credit, and thought that achievements in military diplomacy could be made at once, but in fact, they did not consider the basics or measure their strength, which led to repeated mistakes. In the policy direction announced by Yonai this time, he placed domestic affairs, diplomacy, and military affairs equally as three, and said that he would convene three special cabinet meetings starting today to focus on discussing domestic issues. This pace is difficult because the Abe cabinet fell on domestic affairs, learning from the past and prioritizing urgent matters; also because the parliamentary session is imminent and there is an urgent need to arrange responses; and also because the internal weaknesses are too serious after two and a half years of aggression; and recently, all parties have especially hoped that the new cabinet will have some measures, but looking back at the beginnings of Konoe, Hiranuma, and Abe's ascension, there were many problems in domestic affairs, but they blew their own trumpets in diplomacy and military affairs to shift the focus; the style is different. This is the second point. Since the "May 15 Incident," political parties in Japan have become idle positions. Occasionally, one or two party members enter the cabinet, but they do so either as individuals or in unimportant positions as decorations. In the current cabinet, however, the Minseito and Seiyukai parties each have two cadre representatives entering the cabinet, and the most important position of Minister of Finance has fallen on Sakurauchi of the Minseito system, forming an unprecedentedly good situation for political parties in the past four or five years. On the other hand, the hot bureaucratic forces have greatly declined under public criticism and have failed to occupy prominent positions. This is the third point. From these various measures, which are vastly different from the past, it can be seen that Yonai's administration has difficulty in not making any suggestions or reforms on major principles, and only takes following the traditional policies since Konoe as its ability, but it is urgently trying to change its course in terms of methods and operations, starting with patching up and mending work, in order to defend against the difficulties left by its predecessors. On the one hand, this is naturally because Japan's military diplomacy is on the verge of despair today, and apart from singing old tunes to support the facade, it cannot find any other more effective strategies to save the situation, so it does not dare to deceive itself with empty words and rhetoric. On the other hand, it also shows that the various crises within Japan itself are becoming more and more concrete and superficial, and the authorities can no longer mechanically use the "bureaucratic monopoly" style of Hiranuma and Abe to ignore the social and popular reactions and difficulties.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the trend of Yonai's administration will probably be somewhat mild, just like his own personality, which is exactly what the elder statesmen expect of him. Speaking fairly, Japan has indeed needed mildness in the past eight or nine years, but unfortunately, it has been especially mistaken in being too ungentle since two or three years ago. Now, what is needed is not gentleness, but a drastic repentance and change of plans, but in fact, there is no such outstanding figure, so one can only take it from gentleness. Therefore, the so-called gentleness of Yonai cannot revise the Konoe traditional policy of the past eight or nine years or even two or three years; but it is only preparing to use a gentle face to ease various internal and external contradictions and difficulties; so that its military politics of aggression against China and its attempt to monopolize the Far East can be carried out more smoothly. The major obstacle to its future is not necessarily in the military, because this route does not conflict with the fundamental aspirations of the military, and the military's control over the government has not weakened compared to the past, that is, the new cabinet is still controlled by the military in fact; but today's Japan is fundamentally beyond the reach of any patching up or mending measures, just as anyone taking ginseng pilose antler, warming and tonifying, cannot save a dying patient. The difficulties of the military aggression against China, the ineffectiveness of the political offensive, the increasingly deadlocked US-Japan relations, and the huge budget of more than 10 billion, the continued deterioration and superficial inflation, the unprecedentedly difficult people's lives, and the absolute lack of rice charcoal and necessary materials for production, which of these can be saved by a partial gentle policy that treats the head and cures the foot? Before the "July 7" Incident, if this gentle and prudent proposition could have made those who were determined to run the continent to rein in at the precipice, they could have avoided some of the impending dangers; as for today, when a big mistake has already been made, whether the authorities' policies are radical or moderate, if they cannot fundamentally abolish their deeply ingrained aggressive route, they will eventually be useless. Furthermore, regardless of whether the Yonai cabinet will encounter failure in the short term, the use of this gentle policy is only a momentary matter; after the military, diplomacy, and domestic affairs of aggression against China cannot receive effects from a gentle offensive, what will follow will inevitably be a more adventurous and crazy scene, which is the scene before the collapse!</p>
<h3 id="e10">The Voice of the US Congress for an Embargo Against Japan is Getting Louder; Pittman Calls the Abolition of the Treaty a Powerful Tool to Protect Rights and Interests; Hull Says There is No Date for Resuming Talks in Tokyo; Japanese Experts Advocate Taking Retaliatory Measures Against the US <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Washington: US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman told reporters yesterday that although the Japanese side is publicizing it, the sentiment in Congress to enact a law to prohibit the export of military raw materials to Japan is increasing. If the government does not object, three embargo bills are planned to be discussed in the Senate and four in the House of Representatives. Pittman's proposal has received the most attention from Congress. The proposal argues that if the US President perceives that US rights in China have been violated by the Japanese side, he has the right to impose a ban on the export of scrap iron, gasoline, and other military raw materials to Japan. According to Pittman, the vested interests of the United States in the Far East exceed commercial privileges. In addition to navigation on the Yangtze River, we also demand the cancellation of the new port regulations and the right to use our currency when we feel it is necessary. If the Japanese side can tacitly approve the above points, it would be tantamount to abandoning Japan's "New Order" in China. As for the termination of the 1911 US-Japan Commercial Treaty, to say that the United States and Japan have severed business relations is purely "Japanese propaganda." The termination of the treaty is only for the benefit of protecting US rights and interests in the East. (Associated Press Telegram dated 21st)</p>
<p>Washington: With only five days left until the expiration date of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty, there is much speculation about the progress of talks between the two countries. Secretary of State Hull answered vaguely when questioned yesterday, saying that he did not know when US Ambassador Grew's talks with the Tokyo Foreign Ministry would resume, but of course, they might resume. Hull's use of the term "talks" confirms that there is no so-called "negotiation" in Tokyo, and that Grew's talks are general rather than special in nature. It can also be confirmed that Washington has not had any talks of a negotiating nature. (Reuters Telegram dated 21st)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Renowned Japanese international affairs expert Tamura recently published an article in the Chugai Shogyo Shinpo, commenting on the commercial relations between Japan and the United States, briefly stating, "Ever since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war, a part of US public opinion has advocated prohibiting trade with Japan. If this proposal becomes a reality in the future, our country will definitely retaliate and disregard all international laws and regulations. Looking back, when Italy conquered Abyssinia in 1936, the United Kingdom attempted to prohibit the transportation of kerosene to Italy. At that time, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini resisted regardless of international laws and regulations. Japan should also take this as its method to deal with the United States. On the other hand, it is difficult to understand why the various cases of damage to American industries in China in recent years have not been resolved to this day. Knowing how the relationship between Japan and the United States is will have a great impact on the evolution of the relationship between China and Japan. In other words, the greater the hopes that Japan has in China, the more likely the relationship between the United States and Japan will deteriorate. Conversely, if Japan can make concessions to China, the relationship between the United States and Japan will also improve. However, in order to cope with the US Far East policy, Japan should announce as much as possible the contents of the policy decided by the Abe cabinet on the 8th of this month regarding the handling of the China Incident, so that the United States can understand that our wishes for China are indeed a proper way.

<h3 id="e11">Japan Refuses US Ships to Dock at Saipan Island; Apparently Because the Island Has Defensive Fortifications; The US Defense of Guam is Bound to Become More Resolute <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Washington: The US Navy previously requested the Japanese side to allow the US minesweeper "Penguin" to send 24 shipwrecked Japanese fishermen rescued by the US Navy southeast of Guam on January 15th to Saipan Island to land. The Japanese authorities refused to allow it. The Japanese naval authorities instead asked the US ship to deliver the rescued Japanese crew to the Japanese shipping company's Saipan Maru at Rota Island at 4 pm yesterday. Saipan Island is a heavily defended Japanese island. The US Army authorities have paid close attention to the island. It is said that the island is a Japanese naval base that has already been fortified and is very close to Guam. The Japanese refusal to allow the US ship to go to Saipan Island will prompt the United States to focus its attention on the fact that the Japanese authorities have established defenses on islands very far from Guam, and also recall the US Navy's plan to use Guam as an outpost in the Pacific. It is generally believed that Japan's refusal to allow the US Navy to send Japanese crew members to Saipan Island is enough to make the congressional side no longer have objections to the naval authorities' proposal to increase the naval defense of Guam because Saipan Island has already been fortified.

<p>Hong Kong - A Tokyo dispatch states that the political group (Shikyoku Doshikai) that launched the anti-cabinet movement a few days ago held a meeting yesterday afternoon. Afterwards, the association issued a statement saying that the collapse of the Abe cabinet was due to policy errors that caused public dissatisfaction. However, the new cabinet has also failed to meet the nation's expectations. The association does not understand why the elder statesmen recommended that Yonai form the cabinet. In order to improve politics, the association maintains a critical attitude towards the new cabinet, as its organization is based on maintaining the status quo. At a time of severe national crisis, it is impossible to overcome difficulties without reforming and strengthening internal institutions. (Dispatch from the 21st)</p>

<p>London - The British reply to the U.S. note of December 27 regarding British inspection of U.S. or other neutral countries' postal items at sea or in British ports was released here today. It stated that the British government cannot recognize this inspection as a violation of international law. However, Britain is willing to minimize delays in mail and give friendly consideration to specific accusations. The British government recalled past events in its reply, stating that in 1916, the U.S. government recognized Britain's right to inspect mail in order to prevent contraband items from being sent to neutral countries but actually destined for Germany. The British government's position today is the same as its position in the past. Moreover, letters can not only transmit contraband but also military intelligence. It is permissible under international law for belligerents to prevent the enemy from obtaining this information. The German naval authorities destroyed, without warning, several ships known to carry mail to or from neutral countries, such as the Yorkshire, Dunbar Castle, Simon Bolivar, and Terukuni Maru, disregarding the safety of neutral letters and the lives of passengers and crew. However, the British government has not heard of any protests being made to the German government regarding the destruction of mail. It is self-evident which is more serious: the German government's indiscriminate and deliberate destruction of neutral property versus the British government's inspection of letters, which neither confiscates nor destroys irrelevant mail.

<p>Moscow - The Red Army's newspaper, Red Star, published a lengthy article today entitled "Changes in the Japanese Cabinet," providing a detailed analysis of the Abe and Yonai cabinets. It stated that the Hiranuma cabinet submitted its resignation because the foreign policy advocated by the military had failed completely. Fearing that its own prestige would be further damaged, the military resolutely relinquished the foreground to political party activities, while manipulating events from behind the scenes in the Abe cabinet. Unexpectedly, Abe failed to achieve his policy of "national unity." The political parties, representing the interests of various financial groups, were deeply dissatisfied with the Abe cabinet's domestic and foreign policies and refused to join the cabinet. The Abe cabinet was both powerless and unable to unify the opinions of its members. The Abe cabinet achieved no reform. After the failure of Abe's policies, the Minseito and Seiyukai parties were unwilling to take responsibility. Therefore, the military supported it, and it eventually collapsed due to a vote of no confidence from 250 members of the House of Representatives. The Yonai cabinet is a manifestation of a new attempt to establish a "national unity" government. The reason why the military is unwilling to have an active-duty military officer serve as prime minister is that the cabinet's policies are, in fact, the military's policies. The military is unwilling to bear this responsibility on the surface and prefers to hide behind the scenes and manipulate events, while shifting responsibility to the political parties. The Minister of Colonial Affairs in the new cabinet, Koizumi Akio, is the representative of the army. (Dispatch from the 20th)</p>

<p>Washington - The U.S. Senate convened for ten minutes yesterday. In a solemn atmosphere, Senator Clark announced that Republican isolationist Senator Borah had passed away on Friday night from a cerebral hemorrhage. The Senate decided to hold a state funeral for Borah in the Senate at 12:30 PM on Monday. President Roosevelt, Supreme Court justices, cabinet members, and other officials will participate in the ceremony. (United Press dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>Washington - After the death of Republican Senator Borah, various observers commented that Borah was the leader of the isolationist faction. In his later years, his influence almost swayed American foreign policy. He became a virtual elder statesman in the Senate. All isolationist senators regarded him as their leader and supported him wholeheartedly. With his death, Republican Senator Johnson of California, the drafter of the Johnson Act, is likely to inherit his mantle. This law stipulates that the United States cannot lend funds to countries that default on their debts to the United States. Although this person has a very strong personality, his influence cannot be compared to Borah's. In addition, Progressive Senator La Follette of Wisconsin and Democratic Senator Nye of California are also prepared to continue Borah's policies. These two individuals are both experienced and skilled in debate. Last year, during the Senate's discussion of the Neutrality Act amendment, their eloquent arguments were astonishing and attracted many senators to lean towards isolationism. However, compared to the past, when the Senate discussed the United States joining the League of Nations or the Hague International Court, and Senator Fall fiercely opposed it and achieved a great victory, it is not possible to speak of them in the same breath. In short, international cooperation and the ideals on which the League of Nations was based were all opposed by Borah and never changed throughout his life. Now that he has passed away, the faction that opposes President Roosevelt's foreign policy has suffered a great loss. Although there are successors in Congress, they are not sufficient to be compared with Borah. (Havas dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<p>Berlin - After the news of the death of U.S. Senator Borah reached here, the newspapers here expressed regret and published condolences, expressing their respect. The newspapers repeatedly pointed out that Borah had always opposed the League of Nations. One newspaper said that Borah was one of the most important people engaged in American congressional life. At the beginning of the European crisis, Borah fully insisted on the American isolation movement. Borah's death is truly a great loss to American politics. Borah also proposed a solution to the German Eastern Corridor issue, mistakenly believing that the existence of the corridor should be absolutely abolished. (Haitong dispatch from the 21st)</p>

<h3 id="e21">Churchill's Broadcast: General Discussion of the War Situation; Demands that Concerned Small Neutral Countries Join Britain and France in Resisting Aggression <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>London - The British First Lord of the Admiralty, Churchill, delivered a radio address last night, discussing the war situation. He stated that Germany has lost half of all the submarines it had at the start of the war, and its new shipbuilding program is also far behind what the Allies expected. This seems to be beyond doubt. Currently, Germany's cruelty is primarily directed towards small neutral countries. Neutral ships are being brutally bombed, with no regard for law or humanity. Those who destroy them are not only aimless, wantonly destructive submarines, but also torpedoes that are coldly calculated and intentionally targeted. The only ones who can be safe are merchant ships that join the British and French convoy system. It is estimated that only one out of 500 merchant ships in convoys has been harmed. The British and French navies have taken very good measures. Never in any naval battle have measures been so well prepared. The Allies have no need to ask for rest. Our commerce is increasing every week, and our organization is becoming more perfect every month. Our confidence in our ability to patrol the seas, allowing the routes on which we rely for survival and the tools for victory to be transported, is also increasing daily. As for German submarines, our loyal and diligent reconnaissance vessels can smell them in the deep sea. With the assistance of the air force, I am confident that we will be able to break their strength and destroy their effectiveness. As for the magnetic mines and other mines laid in the straits, they are not an insurmountable problem that will leave us helpless. We must always expect new weapons from the German side, but I dare say that we have an ever-increasing belief in dealing with any developments.</p>
<p>German Submarine Warfare Has Failed</p>
<p>The war has now been going on for five months, and all kinds of attacks that the German side can inflict on the Allies at sea have been blocked. Submarine warfare has now completely failed, and the scourge of mines is also under control. British shipping has not decreased slightly, and there is no trace of surface raiders on the world's oceans. The German pocket battleship Deutschland managed to escape the grasp of the British cruisers, but the Graf Spee sank in the port of Montevideo, forever a monument to Germany's disastrous defeat and demonstrating the fate that awaits any German ship that dares to engage in piracy on the high seas. I hope that the convoy system will reach the highest level of security, so that the commerce of all countries that accept our guidance, not only can survive as usual, but can also flourish even more. Germany's attack on maritime freedom does not block the path of justice or punishment.</p>
<p>Finland's Great Contribution to Humanity</p>
<p>Churchill spoke of Finland's great contribution to humanity, saying that Finland has revealed the weakness of the Soviet army and air force to the world. In the fierce battles in the Arctic Ocean for several weeks, the illusions that many people had about the Soviet Union were shattered. Everyone can now see how communism corrupts the soul of a nation, how it makes it poor and hungry in peacetime, and how it makes it despicable and hateful in wartime. I cannot predict the fate that awaits Finland, but if such a great northern nation is ultimately trampled upon by a brutal army of greater numbers, and falls into a state of slavery worse than death, then nothing could be more tragic. If the flame of freedom, which still shines brightly in the frozen regions of the north, is extinguished, then this will be a prelude to the restoration of the Dark Ages, and all the progress that humanity has made in the past two thousand years will be utterly destroyed. If all the small neutral countries concerned simultaneously fulfill their responsibilities under the League of Nations Covenant and join Britain and France in resisting aggression, will the situation not take a turn for the better? The current position of the small neutral countries is indeed sad, but in the future, it may be more than that. They all hope that the disaster will not arrive temporarily, and that the storm has already subsided. However, the storm may not subside, and it will become more turbulent and widespread, spreading from north to south. Unless there is concerted action, there will be no way to quickly reverse this crisis.</p>
<p>The Goal of the Struggle Will Never Change Slightly</p>
<p>Churchill further spoke of Germany, saying that although Germany is strong on the surface, its psychological and material defects are clearly revealed behind the scenes. We have now seen that its lack of raw materials has had a significant impact on both the quantity and quality of its war industries. We feel that those who rely solely on force are now becoming increasingly suspicious and despondent. In the current struggle, we will never retreat and slightly change our common goal. I hope that the people of Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Austria will not give up optimism, even in their groaning. They will eventually be liberated. Europe will eventually have a day when joy is everywhere, and the victorious countries will rebuild a broad mansion in the spirit of justice and freedom, so that all people can find their place.

<p>London - Gayda, the mouthpiece of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, recently published an article in the Sunday Dispatch here, explaining Italy's attitude towards the current war, stressing the uselessness of prolonging the war, and reiterating the country's determination to oppose communism. It stated that, in my opinion, Britain and France underestimate Germany's resistance. It should be known that Germany has accumulated a large amount of gold and various necessary raw materials for long-term operations, and its strength should not be underestimated. Considering the statements issued by both belligerent countries, there is a possibility that the war will drag on for a long time. If this is the case, not only will Germany go bankrupt, but Britain and France will also be exhausted. Thus, this kind of war runs counter to the true interests of Europe. As for the Treaty of Versailles, it has not only failed to alleviate the unequal distribution of wealth among European countries, but has also intensified it, inevitably causing various disputes. As for Italy's position, the issues that we are most concerned about must be resolved as soon as possible. In short, the Italian nation must obtain fertile land to freely develop. What we are asking for is only to work freely and create freely in a peaceful atmosphere without allowing others to interfere. It should be known that this requirement does not conflict with a plan to establish a fair, sound, and balanced Europe. Our country's attitude towards this European war is based on this goal. Specifically, our country did not initially regard itself as a neutral country. Although we are not directly involved in the war at this moment, we are still prepared to make efforts for peace or war at any time, depending on the development of the situation. In addition, there is one thing that our country cannot ignore, namely the threat of communism. Because our country has vital interests in the countries of Southeast Europe. Although we have no intention of aggression towards the Soviet Union, we deeply know how to resist the crisis posed by communism. In short, our aim is to prevent Bolshevism from expanding its influence in Europe, thereby protecting European civilization. (Havas dispatch from the 21st)</p>

<h3 id="e27">Decline of the Sterling Bloc; Membership Reduced to Five Countries <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>(Haitong News Agency Seaborne Dispatch) War can have an impact on currency systems. After the last World War, the result of political activities regarding currency policy led to two major systems: one advocating free currency systems and the other insisting on restricting currency systems. Britain advocated the former, and Germany promoted the latter. After this round of testing with wartime policies, the sterling bloc has almost disintegrated. In other words, the front line advocating free currency systems has collapsed. For decades, the pound sterling has been the mainstay of world finance and exchange rates. The key to the world has long been in the hands of the masters of the gold pound. The last World War shook this privileged position for the first time. Britain's national debt increased from £650 million to £8 billion (including £128 million in debts from overseas British territories). Before the war, Britain's fiscal balance had an annual surplus of £200 million. In recent years, the balance has not only had no surplus, but has instead had an annual deficit of more than £50 million. After the pound sterling was devalued in 1931, it initially seemed to be a disadvantage, but it was eventually proven to be a success. Especially in 1933, after the U.S. dollar was also devalued following the pound sterling, it further showed that British policy had taken the lead. The result of currency devaluation created an atmosphere conducive to trade development, and the position of the pound sterling became more consolidated. Thus, London was again the center of world finance in 1937.</p>
<p>The heyday of British financial policy was not long-lasting. In recent years, the British government began to revitalize its military, which inevitably required the use of its own capital. It suddenly discovered that Britain's fiscal balance had no surplus, only deficits. Outsiders were initially unaware of this weakness, but by last year, a few people in London had insight into the hidden truth of Britain's seemingly strong but actually weak finances. It spread from person to person and became an open secret.</p>
<p>This European war coincided with the weakening of the pound sterling, so within just a few days of the start of the war, the pound sterling fell by 20 percent. Fortunately, the government quickly stipulated currency system measures, so the pound sterling did not continue to fall.</p>
<p>Some countries that had always belonged to the sterling bloc did not want to follow the pound sterling's decline and affect their domestic economies. At the beginning of the war, they left the bloc. In addition to the Netherlands and its territories, which had already parted ways with the pound sterling last year, the Scandinavian peninsula countries left the sterling bloc in early September. Sweden and Norway first established links with the U.S. dollar, followed by Denmark. Finland, Estonia, and Latvia all broke away from the pound sterling and linked to the Swedish krona. Thus, the influence of the pound sterling in Northern Europe, Eastern Europe, and Southeastern Europe has greatly weakened. Later, Japan and "Manchukuo" also broke away from the British gold pound. The sterling bloc was thus almost completely eliminated.</p>
<p>The collapse of the sterling bloc has great significance. It is not only a failure of Britain's currency system, but it can be said to be a failure of Britain's economy, because the severance of currency links also has a significant impact on trade relations. The result of the pound sterling's devaluation increased the price and value of Britain's imports. At the same time, the value of Britain's overseas assets, which were based on the pound sterling, also fell with the pound sterling. This is also a disadvantage for Britain.</p>
<p>All of the world's raw material markets have recently been using the U.S. dollar instead of the pound sterling for business accounting. The financial power of the United States has increased sharply. Gold and liquid capital have been absorbed by the United States. The value of gold owned by the United States exceeds 170 billion U.S. dollars. This is clear evidence of the victory of the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>The number of members in the sterling bloc over the past decade is divided into four stages in the following table for comparison: (1) End of 1931 - 12 countries: Britain, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Egypt, Japan, Iran, Siam; (2) End of 1934 - 14 countries: added Estonia and "Manchukuo"; (3) Mid-1938 - 17 countries: added France, Latvia, and the Netherlands; (4) October 1939 - 5 countries: only Britain, France, Portugal, Egypt, and Iran remained.</p>

According to his official statement, the battery has shot down as many as eight Soviet aircraft. He stated that he volunteered to join the Finnish army for two reasons: first, he was dissatisfied with the attitude taken by the German government, and second, the Soviet air force had targeted the vocational school he ran in Helsinki as a bombing target. Kilgenpeil has represented the German Olympic Committee in visits to Japan and the United States. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>

<p>Rome: Today, all newspapers carried reports of German and Soviet troop movements and construction of fortifications in the Carpathian Mountains. It is claimed that it is widely rumored in the Hungarian capital that a large number of German troops have entered the southeastern part of the former Polish Galicia province, i.e., the Soviet-occupied oil region. The Italian newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia states that it is rumored that the Soviet Union has dispatched approximately 100,000 workers to the border area between the Slovak state and the Soviet-occupied area of former Poland to construct fortifications, and that these workers are being monitored by the Soviet political police.

<p>Capital of Romania: It is reported that four divisions of German mechanized troops, totaling 50,000 men, have entered the Galician region of the Soviet-occupied area of Poland. It is rumored that this action is based on a newly established secret Soviet-German pact that grants German troops access to the Polish region, but the German side completely denies this. (United Press dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Brussels: The semi-official Belgian News Agency just released a message stating that the rumor that four divisions of German motorized troops have entered the Soviet-occupied area of the former Polish province of Galicia has been firmly denied by German authorities. They stated that it is indeed the case that a portion of the oil produced in the area is to be supplied to Germany according to the German-Soviet economic agreement, but it is undeniable that Germany has not participated in the development of the oil fields there. As for the rumor that Germany and the Soviet Union intend to revise the current border so that the Soviet Union can cede the southeastern oil region of Galicia to Germany, it is also untrue. The German side believes that all these rumors were fabricated by Britain and France to cover up their intensified aid to Finland. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland: A correspondent for the Basler Nachrichten in Berlin just telegraphed that rumors that the Soviet Union is preparing to cede the southeastern part of the former Polish province of Galicia, i.e., the oil region of the Soviet-occupied area, to Germany in the near future have been denied by responsible figures in Berlin. However, they stated that it is indeed the case that Germany has agreed to assist the Soviet Union technically in increasing the oil production in the area. It is generally believed here that in view of this statement, it can be seen that Germany and the Soviet Union have reached an agreement or are about to reach an agreement on this matter, so that Germany can actively develop this oil field. The National Daily states that the Soviet Union is ceding the Galician oil region to Germany in exchange for German assistance in dealing with Finland. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>Moscow: The Soviet Red Star newspaper just published an article detailing the failure of Britain's war plan. The newspaper said, "The intention of Britain's war plan was to sacrifice the small countries of Europe and the Soviet Union in order to reach a compromise with countries that had been deprived of their rights by the Treaty of Versailles. At the same time, it also intended to drag these countries into the war, thereby reducing their strength. In other words, Britain is attempting to use others as tools to fight. After the failure of Munich, Britain incited Poland to fight against Germany. The British ruling class believed that after achieving this goal, it could make the Soviet Union participate in the war against Germany. Unexpectedly, the conclusion of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact on August 23, 1939, dealt a head-on blow to the British ruling class. Even after the collapse of Poland, the British ruling class did not abandon its dream. But at that time, the Soviet-German friendship treaty was also concluded, and they were once again subjected to a major stimulus. The German side then sent troops to the Western Front, and the war has been going on for four months, but the Allied troops are still trapped inside the Maginot Line, unable to do anything. Isn't this a declaration of bankruptcy for Britain's war plan? However, Chamberlain and the British ruling class still console themselves by saying, 'We must endure the hardships of war.' Great Britain has now found a new way to solve its difficulties. The British and French groups are now attempting to drag neutral countries into the war. The current slogan of Britain and France is, 'There should be no neutral countries in the world.'" (TASS dispatch, 21st)</p>

<p>Lhasa: Wu Zhongxin, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, was dispatched to Tibet to preside over the reincarnation of the 14th Dalai Lama.

In addition to the general manager of Tromo, who accompanied Wu along the way, the Tibetan government sent the young masters of the Sharka, Gendün, and Domba families to welcome him in Lhasa.

It is planned to rest for one day tomorrow and then go to the Jokhang Temple and meet with Reting Rinpoche. (Dispatch of the 15th)</p>

<p>Two rice stores, one rice shop, and one rice broker in the Concessions of this port were found to have engaged in out-of-bounds behavior in selling rice under the close supervision of the Concession Police. After a detailed investigation by the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association, the Concession Merchants Association, and the Rice Store Association, the above three places were each fined 100 yuan. Among them, one rice store was ordered to suspend business for two days as a warning because the circumstances were more serious. The local authorities are still paying attention to the rice market and retail transactions. Any dissatisfaction with the rice industry or any news will be carefully considered and investigated by the authorities.</p>
<p>Crowds in Northwest and West Districts Buying Rice</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fair-Priced Rice Committee, entrusted by the Rice Store Association to handle fair-priced rice sales, has been implemented under the protection of the Concession authorities since yesterday. A total of 50 fair-priced rice sales areas have been set up in the two Concessions. Each area is limited to 50 bags of rice for sale. From 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, the general public was overjoyed to hear the news. The Northwest and West Districts are factory areas. All fair-priced rice sales points were sold out in less than two or three hours. Some fair-priced rice sales points in the Central District had not sold out by 6:00 PM and will continue to be sold today to benefit the general public.</p>
<p>Chinese Police Deployed to Maintain Order</p>
<p>A total of 50 fair-priced rice sales points have been set up in the two Concessions. Each point is designated with a rice store to sell tickets and a rice store to distribute rice. There is a sign that says "Shanghai Fair-Priced Rice Committee No. 00 Area - Rice Distribution" or "Ticket Sales" at the entrance. The ticket sales and rice distribution points are guarded by two Chinese police officers dispatched by the police force of the two Concessions to maintain order. A wire mesh fence is also placed at each point, so the order is much better than before. However, some places are still inevitably crowded due to the large number of rice buyers. Fortunately, no unfortunate incidents occurred. A notice from the Rice Store Association is posted at the ticket sales point: "[The rice tickets sold today can be used to collect rice at No. 0 Area, No. 0 Rice Store on a certain road. They cannot be used elsewhere and will be invalid after the next day.]" A notice from the Rice Store Association is posted at the rice distribution point: "[Standard measuring instruments will be used]." In addition, the Yongheng and Daxing rice stores on Haig Road in Xujiahui held fair-priced rice sales yesterday. There were more poor people in that area than in other areas, so the number of people was unusually crowded. Fortunately, the French police dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to the scene to maintain order in advance, so the order was orderly and did not end until 6:00 PM. Then, more than 40 bags of broken rice were sold.</p>

<p>Actively Soliciting Donations for Fair-Priced Rice Sales</p>
<p>The Fair-Priced Rice Committee has been actively soliciting donations so that it can continue to operate without interruption. The total amount already pledged by various Chinese has reached 562,000 yuan. (The voluntary donations from individuals and firms are not included.) These donations have been paid separately to the designated collection banks and money shops. It has now been decided to continue soliciting donations to reach the goal of one million yuan. As for the 100,000 yuan pledged by the banking and money shop industries, it has already been fully subscribed by various banks and money shops. The two associations have notified the various subscribing banks and money shops to pay immediately. Regarding the 20,068 bags of spot broken rice purchased by the Fair-Priced Rice Committee from the Shanghai market, they are now piled up in warehouses in the Concessions. 2,500 bags of rice are distributed to each fair-priced rice sales point every day. Of the 15,000 bags of rice ordered from Saigon, 3,000 bags arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, and another 3,000 bags arrived in Shanghai by ship today. The remaining 9,000 bags will arrive in Shanghai on the 25th.</p>
<p>Restaurants and Hotels Raise Funds to Donate</p>
<p>The Shanghai Restaurant and Hotel Association's fund-raising committee members Li Mancun, Cheng Ke, Ye Zhenchang, Xue Ling, Zhao Yunshao, Lin Liaonan, Shao Shuwei, Hu Yuantang, and others raised funds to donate to refugee relief, which were collected by the association on behalf of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association. From November of the 27th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1938] to December of this year [1940], a total of more than 356,600 yuan was collected and paid to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association on a monthly basis. The association also published the amount collected on a household-by-household basis in the newspapers before the 10th of each month. Now that rice prices in the city are high, which has an impact on the restaurant industry, all restaurants have been notified to donate funds to fair-priced rice sales and reduce rice prices, with the goal of raising an additional 10,000 yuan in funds. The fundraising amount is divided as follows: Grade A: 300 yuan to 1,000 yuan, Grade B: 200 yuan to 500 yuan, Grade C: 100 yuan to 300 yuan, Grade D: 50 yuan to 100 yuan. These are the temporary four grades. Those who wish to increase their donations are welcome to do so as much as possible. It is hoped that the payments will be sent to the Jin Cheng Bank Trust Department and Zhejiang Industrial Bank Yuyuan Qianzhuang and other collection agencies designated by the Fair-Priced Rice Committee as soon as possible to receive receipts. The association will publish the donations in the newspapers to promote kindness.</p>

<p>The Money Traders Association has resolved that February 7th will be the final closing date for the 28th year of the Republic of China. It has also been decided to convene an executive committee meeting on the 25th of this month to discuss plans for handling business before and after the final closing date, and to convene a general membership meeting on February 2nd to approve and implement them. Regarding maturing overdrafts, the old practice of requiring full repayment before the final closing date will remain in effect. However, to support domestic goods businesses, firms have agreed to grant flexibility to factories and businesses engaged in domestic goods production. Furthermore, as the final closing date approaches, all new loans will be temporarily suspended. Due to the final closing, collections have been busier than before, and the volume of negotiable instrument exchange in the banking and financial industries has increased. Businesses have dispatched personnel to collect outstanding debts in this city, and for debts in other cities, they have requested the Chamber of Commerce to issue certificates and also sent personnel to collect debts. It has also been decided to take a four-day holiday starting on February 8th to handle the final closing and to resume business on the 12th. Factories will temporarily suspend work during the closing period for accounting purposes, repairing machinery, and reorganizing. As for the business situation in the 28th year of the Republic, due to the increase in Shanghai's population, demand exceeded supply, resulting in continued abnormal growth in all industries.</p>

Afterwards, the following resolutions were passed: (1) Immediately send letters to relevant domestic goods organizations in this city, and forward letters to the overseas domestic goods inspection representatives to negotiate with the British Straits Settlements government and request a reversal of the order. (2) Before receiving a reply from the representatives, do not privately ship the banned goods to avoid unnecessary losses. The meeting adjourned at approximately 5:00 PM.</p>

<p>U.S. Ambassador to China, Dr. Johnson, arrived in Shanghai on the 18th morning from Qinhuangdao aboard the U.S. transport ship Henderson. He has been busy meeting guests these past few days. Before going to Chongqing, the Ambassador will inspect the Yangtze River. The Ambassador stated that his trip to Hankou does not carry any significant importance. However, at a time when the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty is about to expire on the 26th of this month, the Ambassador's trip is quite worthy of attention. Subsequently, regarding the renewal of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty, the Japanese side once proposed opening up the Yangtze River. However, according to the announcement by the new Japanese cabinet in Tokyo, the opening of the Yangtze River only extends to Nanjing. Therefore, the Ambassador's trip to Hankou is indeed for the purpose of listening to the report from the U.S. Consul General in Hankou regarding the American commercial situation. But the main purpose is to investigate why it should not be opened all the way to Hankou. The Ambassador is scheduled to board the U.S. Yangtze River patrol command ship Luzon this morning, along with Rear Admiral Glassford, the commander of the U.S. Yangtze River Patrol, and his staff, to travel upstream along the Yangtze River, inspecting the situation in Nanjing, Poyang Lake, Jiujiang, and other places.</p>
<p>The estimated itinerary is one week to reach Hankou. The Ambassador's personal secretary, Lafon, Naval Attaché Lieutenant Commander Overesch, and Military Attaché Major [blank] are traveling along to assist. The U.S. ship Wake will follow as an escort and travel to Hankou together. The Ambassador will stay in Hankou for two or three days and then, on the 6th of next month, return to Shanghai by ship protected by the ship Foam. At that time, he will meet with Consul General Gauss again to exchange opinions. Then, he will transfer to a ship to Hong Kong and then to Chongqing.

<p>The Mainland News reports that the crew of the British gunboat Sandpiper, stranded in Changsha, consisting of two officers and twenty-seven sailors, traveled 950 miles by land and will arrive in Ningbo on the 22nd of this month. They will then embark on an oil tanker from the Asiatic Petroleum Company to Shanghai, and are expected to arrive tomorrow or on the 23rd. Previously, the gunboat Sandpiper received orders from the British Admiralty to sail to Shanghai and then leave Chinese waters. However, there are water barriers built downstream from Changsha, preventing the ship from sailing down. Now that Britain intends to recall the trained personnel, it has been decided to leave the ship in Changsha and destroy all munitions aboard. The officers and soldiers departed from Changsha on the 15th of this month in trucks provided by the Chinese government, arriving in Ningbo after a week. However, they are not the first foreigners to travel this land route. On the 8th of this month, more than forty German nationals also came to Shanghai via this route. [They] are keeping silent about the details of this trip, but it is said that [they] are all merchants who are leaving the inland areas for Shanghai due to the commercial situation. Ningbo is now the only gateway into the Chinese interior. From Ningbo, one can go to any place in "free China," but the means of transportation are still mostly simple.</p>
<h3 id="e47">An American National Attacked by a Secret Guard on Yu Yuan Road; Incident Reported to the U.S. Consul and the Police Department; Investigation Underway to Take Appropriate Action <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The Mainland News reports that Mr. Keble, an American national and the owner of Keble Industries Engineering Company in Shanghai, went to a factory near Yuyuan Road on Yih Ting Pan Road at around 11:30 AM on Sunday. On the way, he saw several Chinese people peering into a bamboo fence. Keble, driven by curiosity, also peeked inside and saw several plainclothes Chinese people engaged in military exercises. He then learned that the place was a training ground of some kind. As Keble was looking around and asking questions, he was suddenly turned around by a plainclothes guard. Keble asked, "What do you want to do?" and was struck in the chest five or six times. Keble did not resist and tried to take out [something], suspected to be a record, but was punched to the ground by the other party. Keble suppressed his anger, got up, and explained to the guard that he was only [something].</p>
<p>The address where he was attacked was recorded by Keble as either 23 or 25 Yih Ting Pan Road. He then asked a rickshaw puller a few numbers away if he had seen him being attacked. The rickshaw puller replied "no." Unexpectedly, this was seen by the guard, who went forward again and struck Keble in the chest about five times. Keble did not say a word and walked slowly away. He encountered a British military truck driving by and hitched a ride to the British military sentry post on Yih Ting Pan Road. The British soldiers advised him to report to the police department. After a while, Keble took a rickshaw to his destination to conduct business. Upon completing his business, he returned along Yih Ting Pan Road by rickshaw, stopping briefly at the place where he was attacked to confirm the number he had recorded. He saw the offending guard and two other Chinese people coming out of Lane 1173. Keble then returned and wrote a letter reporting the incident to the U.S. Consul and has requested the police department to investigate the matter. However, the police department has not yet determined the identity of the assailant.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Explanation of Income Tax Questions: Mr. Shen Li-ren's Views <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Accountant Shen Li-ren wrote to the Chamber of Commerce correcting an explanation of income tax questions, stating:</p>
<p>"Dear Sirs, I recently read an explanation of income tax questions in the January 19th newspaper published by the Chamber of Commerce. After reading it, I am quite puzzled. According to Provision 15 of the 'Regulations for the Collection of Category 1 Business Income Tax' promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, 'Business losses from the previous year shall not be included in the calculation for this year.' The meaning of this provision is actually very broad. From the perspective of the fairness of income tax, when the loss affects capital, it should naturally be compensated from the surplus before income tax is levied. The purpose of income tax is to tax surplus. If capital is insufficient and cannot be compensated, then taxing the surplus is no different from taxing the capital. This is one point. As for the section 'If there is no surplus in 1938 and there is a surplus in 1939, the official interest for 1938 shall not be paid retroactively from the 1939 profit... This situation is equivalent to tax evasion...' After checking Explanation 12 of the draft 'Regulations for the Collection of Category 1 Business Income Tax,' 'Interest on capital shall not be recognized as operating expenses or losses. If the taxpayer includes it in the profit and loss statement, it shall be excluded when calculating net profit.' It can be seen that official interest is not an expense, so whether official interest is paid retroactively or not is fundamentally unrelated to the payment of Category 1 Business Income Tax. How can it be called tax evasion? Furthermore, the application of Provision 3, Clause 3 of the Income Tax Regulations is even more irrelevant. As this concerns tax regulations and commercial information, I have taken the liberty to present my humble opinion. I hope you will investigate accordingly."</p>

<p>Mr. Fessenden, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, departed from Shanghai yesterday morning at 11:00 AM aboard the Italian postal company ship Conte Verde for a short trip to Singapore to recuperate. He will return to Shanghai in three weeks. Rumors that Mr. Fessenden has voluntarily resigned have been denied by Mr. Fessenden. At 10:45 AM yesterday morning, Mr. Fessenden, while [blank], arrived at the Jianghai Customs Wharf. Due to previous incidents, the police force increased security yesterday. Police officers patrolled along the Huangpu Bund Nanjing Road area near the Jianghai Customs Wharf. Deputy Director-General Garbutt, who is acting on Mr. Fessenden's behalf, Police Commissioner Major Bowen, and his staff all went to the wharf to see him off. As for the issue of road construction beyond the boundaries in West Shanghai, according to Mr. Fessenden, issues regarding taxation and police authority need to be further discussed. This matter may be delayed. During the Lunar New Year holiday, Deputy Director Garbutt will continue to negotiate and deal with the matter, so it will not be abruptly suspended due to my departure from Shanghai. Negotiations between the Municipal Council and the "Shanghai Municipal Government" have not had any definite new developments. Some issues have been understood, but the contents cannot be disclosed. Mr. Fessenden also hopes that the public will not pay attention to unofficial news. Mr. Fessenden will have a three-week short vacation in Singapore and is expected to return here in mid-February.</p>

<p>There are approximately 5,000 Chinese nationals residing in Poland. The European war was first initiated by Germany and Poland. Due to the abruptness of the events, most of the Chinese nationals residing in Poland did not relocate in advance. According to Chinese nationals who came to Shanghai from France, the German air raids were most severe in Warsaw, the capital of Poland. All prosperous areas have been reduced to rubble. At that time, Chinese nationals residing in France prioritized the safety of Chinese nationals in Poland and separately inquired about the situation of overseas Chinese merchants. However, due to transportation disruptions, there was no communication. According to subsequent investigations, when Warsaw was bombed, Chinese nationals did not evacuate and mostly continued to work as usual, resulting in many deaths and injuries. The whereabouts of more than eighty people are still unknown, and they are likely innocent victims. The majority of Chinese nationals still reside in Poland. A portion of those who lost their jobs due to the war have moved to France.</p>

<h3 id="e52">National Foreign Trade for 1939: Both Imports and Exports Showed an Increase; National Trade Surplus Beginning in November <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance made every effort to adjust China's foreign trade, it promulgated measures to prohibit the import of goods during the emergency period, restricted the import of luxury goods, promoted the export of domestic goods, stipulated methods for collecting exchange rate differences, and designated tung oil, tea, bristles, and minerals as four categories to be purchased, transported, and sold by government trade organizations in a unified manner. As a result,</p>
<p>The trade surplus of the Southwest Customs increased sharply, and the trade deficit of the Shanghai and Tianjin Customs, which had the largest trade deficit, gradually turned into a trade surplus. Therefore, the national foreign trade has been a trade surplus since November of last year. The export of domestic goods did not decrease due to the war, but increased compared to before the war. The net value of imported foreign goods for the entire year of last year was 1,333,653,896 yuan, and the net value of exported domestic goods was 246,500,508 yuan.</p>
<p>Compared with the imports and exports of the previous year, both showed an increase. The imports in the previous year were 886,199,569 yuan, and the exports were 762,641,058 yuan. The following is a record of the total imports and exports for the entire year of last year:</p>
<p>Month Import Export Surplus (+) or Deficit (-)</p>

<p>The Shanghai Coal Briquette Industry Association, citing the rising price of coal dust and increased costs, convened a joint meeting of manufacturers' representatives at the Association's headquarters on Tianjin Road the other day. Representatives from Yitai Hing, Guohua, Nanyang, and other factories, totaling more than ten people, attended. Chairman Chen Cuifang presided over the meeting. As a result of the discussions, it was decided to slightly increase the selling price of the products of various factories, effective immediately: (1) Coal briquettes: 4.40 yuan per dan (100 city catties); (2) Wholesale: 80 yuan per ton, plus 2 yuan for delivery by cart. However, the industry is urging its members to abide by the price limit, and the reasons for the price increase have not been publicly announced.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Work Stopped and Snow Fell in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon; Over Two Hundred People Froze to Death; Charity Organizations Busily Collecting Corpses; Relief Organizations Planning Clothing and Rice Distribution Campaign <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>After snow flakes fluttered in Shanghai from the day before yesterday, the temperature was too high, so they failed to accumulate and melted as soon as they fell. This did not last long. Rain continued to fall until yesterday afternoon, but then stopped. However, the sky was still very gloomy, and the temperature was quite high, showing no signs of getting colder, so it is still difficult to predict whether the weather will improve today. According to the weather station records yesterday, the lowest temperature was one degree Celsius above zero, or 32.2 degrees Fahrenheit, and the highest temperature was 36.7 degrees Fahrenheit. According to weather reports received by the weather station yesterday afternoon, snow had also stopped falling in Hankou and Nanjing, but the weather had not cleared up. Although the weather in Beijing was still very mild, there was a heavy fog. The weather in Qingdao was quite sunny and mild. Due to the cessation of snowfall in Hankou and Nanjing, and the sunny weather in Qingdao, it seems likely that Shanghai will also stop snowing and the weather will clear up. According to weather reports from Fuzhou, it is currently raining there. The weather in other places is quite stable. The snow in Shanghai was not severely cold due to the mild climate, so its benefits were limited. It was not enough to kill pests in the fields. However, the incidence of diseases such as diphtheria, colds, and scarlet fever is expected to gradually decrease.</p>
<p>People Freezing to Death on the Streets</p>
<p>Recently, the climate in Shanghai has suddenly become severely cold, resulting in a large number of corpses of beggars freezing to death. According to a reporter from Datong, the Pushan Villa discovered a total of nineteen adult corpses and ninety-six child corpses within the Public Concession the day before yesterday. Yesterday, there were another twenty-one adult corpses and eighty-four child corpses. In the past two days, a total of 220 corpses have been discovered. The locations where the corpses were discovered were mostly along Fujian Road, Wuhu Road, and Daxilu Road. The charity's corpse collection vehicles are traveling back and forth frequently and are extremely busy. In the French Concession, more than twenty frozen corpses have been discovered in the past two days. The police department notified the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall, which sent corpse vehicles to the morgue. After the court autopsy is reported today, the corpses will be coffined and buried. However, due to the cold weather, similar cases will inevitably continue to occur. Due to the war, the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall's expenses are stretched, and the number of coffins required is enormous. We deeply hope that philanthropists from all walks of life in Shanghai will continuously donate and provide assistance to avoid the suffering of corpses being buried without coffins. The merit is immeasurable.</p>
<p>Please Donate Clothing and Rice</p>
<p>As winter arrives and the weather becomes cold, the plight of poor people on the streets, freezing and starving, is pitiful. Charity groups in the city are promoting street relief for the poor, so that displaced people in the alleys can survive. They are also assisting the concession authorities in maintaining security during the winter prevention period. The joint association's distribution of steamed buns every night is still ongoing on Dagu Road as usual. The distribution of flour has increased to about forty bags per night. The Second Sheltering Center is also actively preparing to open. The China Children's Relief Association is also very concerned about displaced children on the streets. In addition to distributing the collected winter clothing to its directly affiliated children's relief agencies and the children of rickshaw pullers in the northern slum areas, the remainder will be distributed to displaced people on the streets in an appropriate manner. The Shanghai First Special District Municipal United Relief Association has organized clothing and rice distribution campaigns in the winter for the past two years. It is now known that the association plans to continue to hold them this year and is currently drafting the measures. It is rumored that clothing and rice tickets will still be distributed, and donors will distribute them themselves. Those who do not wish to distribute them themselves will entrust the distribution to charity groups or philanthropic organizations in various districts to achieve universal coverage and effective results.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Lawsuit over Rental of a Steamboat Concluded after Third Trial <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Han Funan, a local resident residing at 44 Tongfu Lane, Mintiniyin Road, French Concession, owned a small steamboat before the war, which was dedicated to sailing to various inland river areas. After the August 13th Incident, the boat was docked within the blockade line at Tianshenggang, Nantong. In March of the previous year, it was rented to Qu Changshun, the owner of the Qu Fish Shop, Qu [blank] Qing and Qu Jiujie, uncle and nephew, for transporting fresh fish. At that time, a rental agreement was signed for a period of three months. When the rental period expired, Qu Songxiao personally continued the lease. Liu Wuqi, a native of Wuxi, came forward to sign the renewal lease, with Qu acting as the guarantor. However, after the renewal, Qu and others, without obtaining the boat owner's consent, secretly added the boat to the Japanese-owned "Shanghai Inland River Steamboat Company" and renamed it "Yixing Maru." After boat owner Han Funan discovered this, he filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court against Qu Songqing and others to demand the return of the steamboat. The initial trial resulted in the plaintiff's suit being rejected. Han, dissatisfied with the judgment, hired lawyer Wu Peng to act as his agent and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. After trial, the original judgment was revoked, and the defendants were ordered to compensate 8,000 yuan for the boat's price and 9,200 yuan for damages. After receiving the judgment, Qu again refused to accept it and appealed to the Supreme Court. After years of litigation, the case has been concluded, and the defendants Qu Songqing and others are still ordered to compensate 8,000 yuan for the boat's price. The remaining claims were rejected and returned for retrial.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Shanghai Municipal Council 1939 Child Welfare Work (Continued) <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Monthly Reports on Educational Work</p>
<p>Since January 1, of last year, this bureau requested various relief organizations to report the disposal of cases referred by the Child Welfare Section once a month. The social workers of this bureau maintain close contact with the various organizations and visit some children from time to time. There are two issues concerning these types of cases that are worth noting. One is that some children escape from time to time, resulting in a large number of children, even after being adopted for many years, not having suitable opportunities.</p>
<p>Many Shortcomings in Child Employment</p>
<p>Some children have been found jobs by adoptive institutions, but the institutions do not inquire about the environment after the children are employed, and no contracts are signed with the employers in advance. Most children work in small-scale home textile industries, and their prospects are not promising. Employers do not provide remuneration, except for poor food and lodging. Some employers have openly admitted that they purchased children from adoptive institutions.</p>
<p>Methods for Finding Employment Must Be Improved</p>
<p>There are forty-five cases involving children who have been found jobs by adoptive institutions. Fifteen of them have escaped from their employment locations, and some have returned to shelters. In view of this, the methods for finding employment for these children must be improved, and supervision must be carried out after they are employed. This bureau believes that before children are employed, the social workers of this bureau must visit all relevant parties separately, and employment contracts must be signed in advance to protect the children.</p>
<p>Signing Contracts with Young Workers</p>
<p>The method of signing employment contracts with young workers has been implemented. Each contract has a copy for the Child Welfare Section, the original adoptive institution, the employer, and the employee. If there are any disputes between the employer and the employee in the future, they can file a complaint with the Child Welfare Section.</p>
<p>Protecting Employed Child Labor</p>
<p>This bureau has also taken measures to protect young men and women who are already employed. The aforementioned employment contracts for young workers also apply to these workers. The first step of this bureau is to apply this contract to the light bulb industry. After the war, 33 light bulb factories employed approximately 1,500 child laborers under the age of 18. The contract requires the employer to improve the workers' treatment, and working hours are also specified. In the future, this bureau plans to extend this method to other industries.</p>
<p>Pursuing Legal Action Against Abuse of Female Workers</p>
<p>A large number of female workers, when they were minors, were transferred by their parents to yarn factory foremen. The wages earned by these workers are received by the foremen. The daily working hours are as long as 11.5 to 20 hours, and they are often abused by the foremen. For example, one female worker was malnourished and had pulmonary gland disease, causing her great suffering. She escaped from the factory, intending to return to her hometown, but was unfortunately found by the foreman at the dock and forced to return to the factory. While the two sides were arguing, police officers arrived upon hearing the sound. After questioning, the foreman was prosecuted by the police according to the law. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e58">Shooting Case of a Manager of a Gambling Den: Witness Testimonies of the Incident: Wang Shouchang's Two Attempts, Both Witnessed; Defendant Vehemently Denies, Court Orders Additional Witnesses <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Wang Shouchang, a shareholder in the Yongyuan gambling den in Yongyuanbang and a native of Baoshan, was suspected of instigating a shooting assassination of Zhang Kangmei, another shareholder in the gambling den, at the intersection of Difeng Road and Jing'an Temple Road on the night of July 28th last year, around 8 PM. He was arrested by Chinese detectives Shao Jingfan, Chen Yaoting, Sun Wenxi, Zhang KuiDong, and Wu Junqing from the Chengdu Road Police Station. The investigation revealed that Wang had also shot and injured an employee, Gao Jingen, in the gambling den on the night of March 19th last year. Therefore, Chief Detective Tianyin of the Police Station prosecuted Wang on charges of instigating murder and attempted murder. The Special First Court summoned Wang several times, but Wang vehemently denied the accusations, insisting on his innocence. The court ordered additional witnesses to be summoned for verification. The case was heard again by Judge Lin yesterday morning. According to witness Wang Xingbei, "I used to work at the Yongyuan gambling den. On the night of March 19th last year, Wang Laoban (the defendant) of the Yongyuan gambling den suddenly drove us downstairs. Shortly after, we heard a series of gunshots, about five in total. Later, we learned that our colleague Gao Jinyin was shot by Wang. However, I don't know the reason. On the night of July 28th, when Zhang Kangmei Laoban was shot and killed on Difeng Road near the Jing'an specialty store, I was also present and witnessed it. Wang Laoban was standing about two zhang away from me." On the defendant's side, witness Cai Jinsheng was also invited to the court. After separate questioning, Cai testified, "I work as a runner for the HezHong Automobile Company and have known Wang Shouchang for a long time. After the Shanghai war, I lost my job. On the night of July 28th last year, I invited Wang to dinner at the Jinjiang Tea House in the French Concession around 7 PM to discuss opening a transportation company. The meal lasted about two hours, and then we parted ways." When questioned, Wang Shouchang hired lawyers Yu Xiangqin and Jiang Rong to defend him in court. Wang not only vehemently denied the accusations but also stated that he indeed had dinner with Cai Jinsheng at the Jinjiang Tea House on the night of July 28th last year. After the meal, he went to the home of Liang Junqing, a Cantonese resident in the French Concession, and requested that Liang be summoned to court. He claimed, "The reason I am being framed is that Zhang Dimei, Zhang Kangmei's younger brother, is trying to seize the property. Zhang and I are both shareholders in the Yongyuan gambling den, and I earn 42 yuan in salary every day. Since the incident, rumors have spread, and I have temporarily taken refuge. Unexpectedly, my salary has been stopped by Zhang, amounting to several thousand yuan. In addition, the gambling den's profits since its opening two years ago, including all assets, total about 200,000 yuan. Zhang Dimei intends to embezzle everything, so he unscrupulously instigated others to make false accusations." Judge Chuan verified the statements and, considering the importance of the case, ordered a postponement to summon additional witnesses for questioning.</p>

<p>Xie Yichang, also known as Ji Zong, a 26-year-old native of Ningbo and an employee of the Dachanglong Customs Brokerage at No. 4, Lane 31, Jiangxi Road, married Liu Lianying (currently 23 years old), a woman from his hometown, seven years ago. However, Liu was slightly unattractive and not favored by Xie. Therefore, she lived with his mother. Last year, when Ningbo was bombed by Japanese planes, she came to Shanghai. After she arrived, Xie had her live with his elder brother, Xie Lunhui. Unexpectedly, on the 7th of last month, the Xie brothers lured Liu out and went to a Tinghua law firm, instructing her to sign and affix her fingerprint on a contract. They claimed that the contract stated that Xie Yichang was voluntarily paying her 15 yuan per month for living expenses, with one year's worth, totaling 180 yuan, paid in advance. However, this 180 yuan would only be paid when she obtained her travel permit to return to her hometown. As a woman, she was illiterate and completely followed their instructions. Later, her brother-in-law discovered that the contract she signed was not a contract for living expenses but a divorce decree. Only then did she realize she had been deceived. The next day, she hired a lawyer, published a statement in the newspaper about the incident, and filed a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Special First Court against Xie, seeking confirmation that the divorce decree was invalid. Judge Mo Runzhang opened the court yesterday and summoned them for questioning. She and her lawyer explained the facts of the incident. According to Xie Yichang's statement, the divorce was voluntary on both sides, and he had paid 1,800 yuan in alimony at the time. When the court asked him where the money came from and why he didn't invite her relatives and friends to witness it at the time, Xie replied that the money was borrowed from Bi Huiting, the manager of Dachanglong, but he did not explicitly state that it was for divorce purposes. The court, considering that the case still required further investigation, ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>

<p>At the Yuyuan gambling den at the intersection of Yuyuan Road and Daxilu in western Shanghai, around 11 PM last night, while gamblers were excitedly betting at various tables, a sudden explosion occurred. Instantly, iron shrapnel flew everywhere, smoke filled the air, and screams echoed outside. The crowd was terrified and scrambled to escape, creating chaos. The staff of the gambling den, fearing the gamblers would scatter, desperately claimed that nothing was wrong and instructed the tables to continue gambling as usual. However, they could not conceal the injured male and female gamblers. They urgently arranged for vehicles to transport the four or five injured people to the hospital for treatment. The general gamblers, shocked by the incident, scattered like birds and beasts.</p>

<h3 id="e66">Ministry of Education's Measures for High School and Normal School Graduates in Shanghai for Further Education: Students Failing One or Two Subjects Will Receive Certificates of Attendance; Colleges Above the Associate Degree Level May Accept Them as Auditors in the First Year <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing News) The Ministry of Education recently announced that after the outbreak of the war, the joint graduation examinations for high schools and normal schools in Shanghai were discontinued, and each school was responsible for its own graduation examinations. Students failing one or two subjects will still be handled according to the original regulations. Colleges and universities at or above the associate degree level that admit freshmen in the first year will base their decisions on the graduation certificates issued by each school, subject to review. Students failing one or two more subjects, holding certificates of attendance issued by their original schools, will still be admitted as auditors according to the law. If they wish to become formal students, they must still participate in the next joint graduation examination. Only after passing the examination and obtaining a graduation certificate from their original school will they be considered valid. Since the joint graduation examination has been discontinued, the Ministry of Education has ordered all colleges and universities at or above the associate degree level to allow these students failing one or two subjects to participate in the graduation examination of their original school. After passing the supplementary examination and obtaining a graduation certificate, they should submit it to the Ministry of Education through their school for verification.</p>

<p>— Chen Lijiang</p>
<p>(V) Other Educational Facilities</p>
<p>Other noteworthy facilities will be described as follows, focusing on the most important:</p>
<p>(1) "Promoting Education in Border Areas": The Ministry of Education established a special Border Areas Education Committee to oversee this work. The National Institute for Compilation and Translation established a Border Areas Group specifically to edit border area books and textbooks. The number of Mongolian and Tibetan primary and secondary schools in Suiyuan, Xinjiang, Gansu, and Qinghai all increased this year. A new Mongolian and Tibetan Theological Institute was established in Mount Wutai to implement higher education. The Southwestern Normal School was established in the Southwest to train teachers for border area education. In July, the Ministry of Education also organized a Border Areas Education Working Group to carry out work. Xi Rao Jia Cuo was sent to various temples in Qinghai to promote lectures and promote the development of border cultures. (2) "Promoting Overseas Chinese Education": The Ministry of Education and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission are currently planning to establish overseas Chinese education. The Design Committee and the Overseas Education Commissioners will soon formulate regulations and measures for implementation. (3) "Promoting Education in War Zones": The Ministry of Education has also formulated implementation plans and detailed measures for education in war zones, which are being actively implemented, such as sending supervisors to guide the work, finding ways to accommodate and train unemployed and out-of-school youth, and launching a movement for education personnel in war zones to return to their hometowns to promote education work. Efforts are also being made to disrupt the enemy's enslavement education in order to reduce its effectiveness. (4) "Promoting Sports Facilities and Scouting Education": In the field of school sports, three implementation plans for physical education in primary schools, secondary schools, and colleges above the associate degree level have been formulated. In the field of social sports, physical education regulations and work outlines have also been formulated and implemented. The number of physical education teachers is also being expanded and trained. This year, the National Central University and Normal College have expanded their specialized departments to cultivate specialized sports talents. The Ministry of Education and the China Scout Association have jointly organized training classes for scout instructors, conducting phased training for existing scout leaders to improve scouting education. (5) "Holding the Third National Education Conference": Based on the resolution of the First National Political Council, the Ministry of Education convened the Third National Education Conference in Chongqing in March of this year. It was a grand event, bringing together educators from across the country to discuss educational issues and reforms. The conference comprehensively discussed and resolved various important educational issues. The Ministry of Education referred to these resolutions and implemented them separately after the conference. (6) "Others": The above-mentioned are mostly the government's efforts to promote and reform education. It is also generally very active and progressive. For example, the understanding of the importance of education among members of society is more definite. Private scholarships and scholarships, especially in the war zone provinces, and the prevalence of knowledge and the widespread teaching of intellectuals, the strong atmosphere of academic research and academic lectures, and the active organization of social education by various institutions and groups are too numerous to mention. These all demonstrate the vigorous and vigorous vitality of today's education.</p>
<p>(VI) Conclusion</p>
<p>In summary, the educational facilities this year, whether in higher education, secondary education, primary education, social education, or other aspects, are continuing the established educational policies and strategies of the past, making further efforts, and continuously advancing and innovating in accordance with the instructions of the Commander-in-Chief and the actual needs. We are very gratified by these constantly changing and improving phenomena. Although the enemy is using vicious enslavement education and cruel atrocities to undermine us in many ways, we are accelerating the creation and actively striving against them. We are comforted by the achievements of this year, and we must have confidence that our strength is great. From now on, every effort will bring more harvest. We must not be complacent in the slightest, and we must constantly encourage ourselves to achieve greater success. We must recognize that we are in a turbulent era, in a difficult environment. In the future, we need constant perseverance to coordinate education with politics, military affairs, and everything else, keeping pace and moving towards the goal of resisting the war and building the country, moving forward, moving forward, moving forward. Dawn is not far away, and the light of victory is right in front of us. Let us work together to build on the achievements of the past and add to the efforts of the future, give full play to the role of education, and surely complete the great mission entrusted to us by this era, promote the process of resisting the war and building the country, and usher in a bright future.

<p>(Chengdu News) The Provincial Government held a Memorial Week event at 9:00 AM on the 8th. Secretary-General Guo Guang, Department Directors Hu Ciwei, Chen Zhushan, Guo Youshou, Liu Zhaoli, Chief Secretary Meng Guangpeng, and more than 400 staff members attended. After Secretary-General He acted as chairman and led the attendees through the rituals, Department Director Guo Youshou delivered an impromptu report, saying, "Chairman, members, colleagues, I gave a report to everyone on the general situation of the Education Department's work during the Memorial Week after the summer vacation last year. Regarding the department's work last year, in addition to some concurrent work, the more important matters were published in a "Sichuan Education in the Past Year" article that I published in the newspaper on New Year's Day. I will not repeat them today. Now I only intend to report briefly on a few important tasks from last year that were not mentioned in the newspaper, and then talk about the main central tasks for this year. First, regarding educational funding, the total budget for educational funding last year was 4.6 million yuan, but the actual expenditure reached more than 5.2 million yuan. Among them, the most important overspending items were the evacuation fee of 200,000 yuan, the subsidy to Sichuan University of 178,000 yuan, and also increasing teachers' salary discounts and subsidizing war zone students, etc. Secondly, regarding the work aspect, it can be summed up with the word "stability." Although there were minor problems in a few schools, things were generally stable. Last year, our department put the most effort into vocational education in secondary education. At the end of April, our department held a discussion on agricultural vocational teaching. Our plan is to divide the entire province of Sichuan into five guidance zones to effectively promote it, and then hold a conversation on industrial vocational education. These are all efforts to concentrate our efforts and engage in vocational education. The (uncontinued)</p>

<p>The Shanghai Refugee Production and Consumption Cooperative held a charity table tennis tournament to raise production funds for refugees. Yesterday afternoon at 1:30 PM, in the midst of swirling snowflakes, it was held at the Lido Ballroom. More than a thousand guests attended, and the revenue was estimated to be over two thousand. Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xiaochu, Xi Yushu, Li Shuxiong, Gao Huaide, Gao Huailiang, Yuan Deng, Wu Zhaoyuan, and Mr. Yang Caoxian, a 102-year-old, served as chairmen. Wu Zhaoyuan delivered the opening remarks, followed by the ball opening ceremony by Yang Huaxian. Xu Duo, Zhongqiu, Yu Binqi, Chen Linsheng, and Ding Du served as referees. The first event was a performance by top female players in Shanghai, including Zhang Yongru, Lin Jinlan, Cai Xiuyu, Wang Guangmei, Hu Jiahe, and Yan Wenjun, which was quite wonderful and won a round of applause from the guests. The next event was a match between the Shanghai mixed team and the Qingyun table tennis team. Both sides made great efforts due to the strong opponent in front. In particular, Deng Xiurong, the main player in Group B, defeated Wang Changhou, a mixed team star, by a score of three to one, which greatly increased Qingyun's morale. Ouyang Wei of the mixed team defeated Yao Guanfan with a skillful spin, creating a one-to-one situation. Unexpectedly, Wang Huizhang and Yang Zhaoxiang were defeated by Zhang Ying and Xie Shouhua, causing Zhang Lianshou, who was good at hard smashing, and Rong Deneng, a well-known defensive player, to lose their will to fight and surrender to Zhang Zhihong and Lu Hanjun of Qingyun in straight sets. In the last group, Lian Zhu was unusually fierce, but Qingyun's Guo Jingren could not resist and was defeated. As a result of the fierce battle, Qingyun defeated Qiahe by a score of five to two. After the game, Chairman Xi Yushu delivered the closing remarks and awarded pennants to the captains of each team. The meeting then dispersed. The association was grateful to Gao Huaide and Gao Huailiang, presidents of the Lido Sports Association, for their enthusiasm in lending the ballroom free of charge for this large-scale competition. In addition, Yan Zhonglin of the Hei Ren Toothpaste Factory, Yan Jilin of the Bai Chang Company, the Lido Sports Association, and Yu Qiaqing and other gentlemen each presented a commemorative flag, which was truly touching. The battle records of the two teams are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Qingyun Team　Mixed Team　Score</p>
<p>Deng Xiurong　Wang Changhou　3-2</p>
<p>Yao Guanfan　Ouyang Wei　0-3</p>

<p>— Zhu Boquan</p>
<p>This article consists of six sections, divided into (1) Introduction, (2) Issuance of Legal Tender, (3) Black Market Foreign Exchange, (4) Bond Market, Gold Market, Stock Market, (5) Banking Industry and Interbank Remittances, and Epilogue. The first and second sections have already been published in the previous issue. In the third section, the dynamics of the black market foreign exchange were described up to the end of June last year. Now, we continue to describe the foreign exchange market situation and the fourth section. The fifth and sixth sections will be continued in the next issue.</p>
<p>In early July, the Ministry of Finance announced three regulations regarding the adjustment of trade and the management of foreign exchange, stipulating (1) that imported goods, which are deemed necessary, a certain number of types, are all subject to prohibition. (2) For all imported goods that have been approved for the purchase of foreign exchange, the Central Bank and Bank of Communications will supply and sell at their respective listed prices, but a balance fee should be paid for the difference between the legal price and the market price; (3) All foreign exchange obtained from the sale of exported goods should be sold to the national bank at the legal price, and the Central Bank will provide the equivalent difference between the legal price and the listed price of the Central Bank and Bank of Communications. The Central Bank and Bank of Communications listed prices are generally lower than the legal price and higher than the black market price. Due to the special circumstances in Shanghai, the above regulations could hardly be implemented in general.</p>
<p>After the exchange rate fell to a new level of six and a half pence in early July, except for a temporary lengthening when the banking industry was once again restricted from withdrawals by order of the Ministry, the market price remained relatively stable for more than a month thereafter, while the craze for purchasing continued to increase. This was because speculators were severely hit by the sharp contraction of the exchange rate at that time, and precisely because they had been hit, they were constantly purchasing out of concern for future changes. Speculators followed suit. In early July, a large amount of legal tender from North China was transported to Shanghai, forming another pressure on the foreign exchange market. Therefore, the HSBC listed price contracted sharply step by step from six and a half pence to a new price of four pence in the week from July 17 to 24, causing unrest among the people and intensifying the speculation. On August 5, rumors circulated that the government had ordered the printing of a large amount of banknotes abroad, and the exchange rate plummeted to 3.25 pence that day. The government then declared the rumors to be untrue, and the people's minds were slightly calmed. In late August, on the eve of the European war, as news of the breakdown of negotiations between Germany and Poland, the conclusion of the Soviet-German commercial treaty, and the announcement of various wartime economic measures by Britain and France were transmitted, the foreign exchange market suddenly showed signs of loosening.</p>
<p>The third period was from the outbreak of the European war to the end of the year. On September 1, the British and French governments announced that a state of war had been established with Germany. By September 2, the black market exchange rate had lengthened to more than four pence. Although it later contracted several times due to rumors of peace in Shanghai's west end and other factors, the overall trend remained strong due to the following reasons. From October 27 to November 24, the exchange rate often remained above five pence, with the highest price being 5.5625 pence. Afterwards, it softened slightly to within five pence, and the market was stable, hovering around 4.5 pence. Around Christmas, it showed signs of loosening again. Our observation of the reasons for the lengthening of the exchange rate in the past four months is mainly due to five factors:</p>
<p>(1) Capital flight caused by the European war. After the outbreak of the European war, the British government declared that it did not intend to maintain the international price of the pound sterling. Overseas British exchange rates lengthened. At the same time, various British territories in the Far East successively implemented currency controls, and Hong Kong also introduced income tax. Overseas Chinese capital flowed back to Shanghai, but the Shanghai British exchange rate fell, and the US exchange rate also fell, but the fall was slightly less than the British exchange rate. (2) The decrease in imports. According to investigations, Shanghai's imports have decreased since September, by approximately 194 million yuan, a sharp decrease in October, by approximately 92.5 million yuan, and a further decrease in November, by approximately 78.3 million yuan. At the same time, exports showed signs of loosening, approximately 67 million yuan in September, an import surplus of approximately 18 million yuan in October, and an export surplus of approximately 14 million yuan in November, which was unprecedented. However, we should pay attention to the fact that agricultural products and other exported goods are no longer operated by Chinese people, and cotton, Jiang cotton textiles, etc., are also largely not manufactured by Chinese people themselves. As for the reasons for the decrease in imports and the increase in exports, most of them are due to the decrease in exchange rates after June. The two are mutually cause and effect. The "standards that conform to the beneficial Chinese economy" mentioned in the authorities' speeches only became apparent after three months; the European war is another reason. (3) After the exchange rate fell, the foreign exchange that could be obtained by those who "bought for arbitrage" using various methods to collect legal tender was greatly discounted. And the other party often had a great need for legal tender itself. For example, this autumn's bumper harvest of agricultural products required legal tender to purchase cotton or rice in the war zone. At that time, those who sold foreign exchange on the market to exchange for legal tender were the same party that had been constantly buying for arbitrage, which is quite contradictory and can be generally illustrated by Tongling. (4) Speculators' purchases have obviously decreased. The impact of the European war on foreign exchange is like this, the trade situation is like this, and good news from Changsha and other places are frequent. In the black market foreign exchange with the most rumors, it is like a person with a fever who is initially given a cooling agent. Looking at the recent situation, most of those who made profits left the market, and those who endured the pain to close their positions were also common. Although they have the desire to wait for opportunities to move, their will is not as ambitious and dedicated as in the past. (5) General commercial confidence gradually recovered in the second half of the year. Recently, there are probably not many who purchase for the sake of personal wealth.</p>
<p>One point that we should also pay attention to is that many foreign exchange commentators believe that the Exchange Equalization Fund often buys appropriately during the several rallies after August, so that the market price changes are relatively moderate. Therefore, if there had been no purchases by the Equalization Fund from August to the present, the rebound would not have been limited to this.</p>
<p>4. Black Market for National Debt, Black Market for Cash, and Foreign Stock Market</p>
<p>Foreign Stock Market</p>
<p>(A) Black Market for National Debt After the Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese Securities Exchange was ordered to suspend business, and the trading of domestic public bonds was also conducted on the black market. Last year, due to the increase in floating capital in Shanghai, this black market trading became increasingly active. Although there have been several changes this year, they were very temporary. In the course of a year, it was generally stable. However, the speculative nature and excitement of public bond trading were far less than foreign exchange and cash, and it could not be regarded as equal.</p>
<p>On January 15 of this year, the Ministry of Finance declared that the customs tax revenue in the war zone had been withheld, and the principal and interest of the national debt that should have been remitted by the relevant customs had accumulated to a huge amount of 175 million yuan due to government overdrafts and advances. The long-term debts guaranteed by customs duties before the war would no longer be advanced. When the news came, each debt plummeted by more than six yuan. At the end of January, the principal and interest of the public debt due were still paid in legal tender by the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, but the payment location was changed to Chongqing. The Shanghai bondholders could collect from the three banks in six months, and the people's minds were slightly calmed. The market price rebounded strongly, and on June 13, it rose to a new post-war peak.</p>
<p>On June 19, less than ten days after the sharp contraction of the foreign exchange rate, the news of the suspension of payment of principal and interest on national debt followed. At the same time, there were also restrictions on withdrawals. The bond market was shaken, and the market price fell continuously. The black market temporarily suspended trading on June 20 and resumed on July 4. Soon, the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications undertook the discounting of matured principal and interest coupons of public bonds, and paid them in interbank remittances in six installments. The market situation recovered. After September, there was repeated good news from the domestic war, and the interbank remittance system was newly improved, the discount rate decreased, and the market price tended to be firm and stable. Recalling the many changes in the financial market this year, the intensity of the fluctuations, and the prevalence of rumors, even the August 15 incident could not surpass it. However, looking at the prices of domestic public bonds throughout the year, although the surface figures are slightly lower than last year, the actual income varies with the change of procedures for repayment of principal and interest. Calculating the market price based on the ratio of principal to subsidiary, it is not much inferior. The excellent credit of national debt and the trust of the Shanghai public in the government can be seen here.</p>
<p>(B) Black Market for Cash Since last March, the black market for foreign exchange has been active, and the cash market has also revived. In May, due to the government's implementation of foreign exchange management, the price of the cash black market gradually rose, and by November, it had risen to more than 2,000 yuan per ten taels. In the first half of this year, due to the lack of cash chips and general purchases from North China, the market price continued to rise gradually. Since the sharp contraction of foreign exchange on June 7, the buying spree has become more intense. Wealthy people and speculators divided their belief and interest in foreign exchange to worship gold, and the view of a soaring market price became almost commonplace. On July 18, it broke through the 3,000 yuan mark, and on July 21, it reached 4,600 yuan, which was the highest record. Although it fell sharply afterwards, it rebounded wildly to 4,800 yuan. Afterwards, except for two declines in early September due to the European war and at the end of November due to the Ministry of Finance's announcement of a ban on gold deposits, it rose again to more than 4,000 yuan after December 1. This is because Shanghai's environment is special, although it is clearly known that storage violates the ban, and the door for mortgages has also been closed, buying and selling and speculation are still the same. The annual gold market price generally rises and falls with foreign exchange, and the situation is not very consistent with the international gold market price.</p>
<p>(C) Foreign Stocks Various foreign stocks and bonds have always been traded at the British Business Company. There are many types. Securities purchased by the banking industry, in addition to national debt, are also one type of foreign stock. Trading decreased after the war, and there was a gradual improvement last year. After the changes in the foreign exchange market in June this year, foreign stock trading became increasingly frequent. The outbreak of the European war particularly stimulated various businesses. The market prices of various industrial stocks, rubber stocks, and public utilities have generally risen. The buying and selling situation is not as common or speculative as the foreign exchange market and the gold market.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Comparison of Economic Dependence between Japan and the United States <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Zhi</p>
<p>The review of the issue of economic dependence between Japan and the United States is not only about what kind of economic state will occur between the two sides after the Japan-US Treaty of Commerce and Navigation is not renewed and formally expires on the 25th of this month? It also has very important significance for the currently stalled Japan-US talks. Because the strength of mutual economic dependence is one of the most important factors determining the attitude taken in trade treaty negotiations.</p>
<p>As for economic dependence, if we say it according to common sense, then international economics is the same as individual economics. If Party A sells one hundred to one party and Party B also sells one hundred to Party A, then the economic dependence between Party A and Party B is half a catty and eight taels. If Party A sells to Party B only half of what Party B sells to Party A, then Party A's economic dependence on Party B is only half of Party B's on Party A. However, this is a common sense idea. In fact, the commodities traded between the two sides have different degrees of importance to the other side, and the production of exported goods by both sides also occupies different positions in the national economy of their respective countries. Therefore, the dependence inferred from the quantity alone cannot be considered appropriate.</p>
<p>Is the commodity sold to the other party absolutely necessary? Are there substitutes that can be used instead? Can the other party also buy it from a third country? Furthermore, is the production business of this exported commodity important in the national economy of the producing country? These issues must be considered together in order to accurately grasp the economic dependence of both parties.</p>
<p>Comparison of Trade Quantities</p>
<p>Japan's economic relationship with the United States is in a state of huge import surplus. From 1934 to 1938, the total amount of Japan's exports to the United States was 2.6 billion yuan, and the total amount of imports from the United States was 4.5 billion yuan. The import surplus for five years was 1.9 billion yuan, that is, the ratio of Japan's exports to the United States to imports is four to nine. At the same time, the total amount of the United States' trade surplus in these five years was 7.2 billion yuan, and the trade surplus with Japan accounted for 27 percent of the total amount. Therefore, in common sense, Japan accounts for 27 percent of the United States. Therefore, in common sense, Japan is a good customer of the United States, and it seems inappropriate to give up easily; or when the United States is mired in recession, or when the exports to Japan are limited to what Japan needs and not what other countries need, it also makes the United States reluctant. However, there are two major facts that have made the United States turn away from the Japanese market without any reluctance. The first is on the Japanese side, because its import capacity has been decreasing year by year in recent years, especially since the outbreak of the war of aggression against China; and Japanese products are not welcomed or needed by the United States. The second is that the demand for American goods from countries other than Japan is gradually increasing, especially after the outbreak of the European war, and countries such as Britain and France are even more crowded with orders from the United States. Therefore, the United States' economic dependence on Japan can be said to no longer exist.</p>
<p>If we further divide Japan's trade with the United States into exports and imports for individual observation, then even with the highest record of Japan's imports from the United States in 1937, it only accounted for 9.8% of the total amount of US exports. As for exports to the United States, in the last five years, it has only been between 6.4% and 7.4% of the total amount of US imports. It can be seen from this that the US-Japan trade relationship is one-tenth of the total. Conversely, how does it look from the Japanese side? Japan's exports to the United States accounted for 26.5% of Japan's total exports in 1937 and 40.2% in 1938. This is equivalent to saying that the United States is one-quarter as important to Japan as a market and four-tenths as a supplier of materials; the importance of its position is evident.</p>
<p>Comparison of Trade by Commodity</p>
<p>The above only observed the quantity of trade between Japan and the United States. The results have already shown that the Japanese economy is absolutely dependent on the United States, while the United States does not need to depend on Japan. If we further examine the importance of the commodities traded between the two sides in the other side's economic activities, and the importance of the production of exported goods in the national economy of the country, then the mutual interests can be clearly seen at a glance.</p>
<p>Japan's main commodities exported to the United States are raw silk, followed by canned food, pottery and porcelain, textiles, toys, vegetable oil, pyrethrum, tea, seeds, camphor, etc. And among these, except for raw silk, which reaches about 300 million yuan per year, the rest are only several million yuan. Moreover, none of these items are absolutely necessary, and raw silk, which occupies the most important position, is precisely a luxury item. This means that Japan's exports to the United States are not necessary for the United States. If it can refuse its imports, it is precisely in the interest of the American economy, but the production of these exported goods occupies a very important position in the Japanese national economy; especially raw silk, in which more than 10 million people in Japan are engaged in silkworm breeding and silk reeling for a living, and more than 90% of this raw silk is produced exclusively for export to the United States. Therefore, as long as the United States bans the import of Japanese silk, the Japanese national economic life will experience extreme turmoil. And in the United States, what is there to protect? Conversely, if we observe the commodities that the United States exports to Japan, that is precisely the blood of Japan's wartime economic system. According to a survey by the Berlin Institute for Economic Research, military supplies account for nearly half of Japan's recent import trade. Moreover, direct military materials are not included in the customs record! (Unit: million Japanese yen)</p>
<p>1936 1938</p>
<p>Total Imports 2,764 2,663</p>
<p>Military Supplies 660 1,247</p>
<p>Other 2,104 1,416</p>
<p>Military supplies imported by Japan from foreign countries already account for half of the total import trade. If we add the amount outside the customs record, it is even more evident that it occupies an overwhelming majority. As for the position of the United States in the total amount of these military supply imports, let us quote the words of Japanese Koijima Seiichi. He said this in the November issue of "Japanese Heavy Industry" magazine: "...From the perspective of overseas supply of national defense resources, the United States occupies the most important position. In fact, more than half of the overseas export amount of commodities related to national defense is imported from the United States. Moreover, there are extremely many types, from important military industrial raw materials such as petroleum (100 million to several hundred million yen), scrap iron (80 million to 100 million yen), copper (30 to 40 million yen), to highly scientific products such as machinery, automobiles, and airplanes (tens of millions of yen each), everything is imported, so from the perspective of national defense economy, the United States is particularly necessary to pay attention to the materials before the occurrence. The United States' military supply exports to Japan already accounted for more than half of the total military supply exports to Japan from various countries. After the war broke out, although Japan has not publicly announced such figures. However, judging from the two facts that Japan's overall import capacity has been reduced and the need for military supplies has increased, the ratio of US military supplies exported to Japan in the overall US exports to Japan must be greater than before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. At the same time, since the outbreak of the European war, even if the military supplies exported to Japan from other countries are not completely cut off, it is undoubtedly a drastic reduction; therefore, it is inevitable that the import volume of US military supplies will increase even more. Therefore, since the Sino-Japanese War, the United States' military supply exports to Japan have contained more significant increases in both relative and absolute quantities." Here, it can be clearly understood that the US exports to Japan, mainly military supplies, are absolutely important in nature for Japan in wartime. Then, is this export to Japan important in the American national economy? This can be given a negative answer. Because since the outbreak of the European war, the telegrams from Britain, France and other countries ordering military supplies from the United States have been flying in like snowflakes, and the American military industry is so busy that it cannot cope; therefore, whether Japan buys American military supplies (in fact, it must buy) and whether the United States exports to Japan or not is insignificant in the United States. On this point, it can be known that the production of US exports to Japan is not at all important in the American economy.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In summary, the economic dependence between Japan and the United States, whether in quantity or in substance, the United States depends on Japan very little; but Japan, especially Japan in wartime today, must rely on the United States. And this situation of Japan's economic dependence on the United States is precisely a powerful weapon for the United States to carry out its international sense of justice, and it is also a powerful weapon for laying the foundation for a just peace in the Far East and ensuring all the rights and positions of Europe and the United States in the Far East; therefore, whether or not the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation is renewed is a touchstone of the American sense of justice. The United States neither abolishes the treaty to promote his sense of justice, so unless Japan gives up its aggression, the future of the US-Japan treaty renewal problem is extremely pessimistic.</p>

<h3 id="e79">Goods En Route Have Not Arrived, Rice Prices Are Rising <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The north wind is whistling and the snow is flying. Goods en route have not arrived as scheduled, resulting in no arrivals yesterday. Furthermore, Sunday is a bank holiday, which further reduced the supply of goods. Therefore, the market is scarce in various goods, and people's minds are firm. Sellers are shouting higher prices. Although local stores are not as enthusiastic as before, inland merchants are still buying smoothly. Prices of various goods rose across the board in the early market. Thick japonica rice opened at 40 yuan, and the medium-grade Lisheng japonica rice was also sold at 29.5 yuan. Other varieties such as Qingsi extra thin were reduced to 40 yuan, but were actually sold at 39.67 yuan. Nan'gang early and late rice were priced at 39 yuan to 38.5 yuan. Changshen extra yuan was around 40 yuan, and lower grades also required 28 or 29 yuan. Keyuan was sold at 37 yuan, an increase of 0.5 to 0.7 yuan compared to before. Various types of foreign rice had more goods on the market and were also selling well. Therefore, the market outlook was no less than that of domestic rice, with an increase of 0.5 to 0.6 yuan. No. 1 Saigon opened at 29.2 yuan, No. 2 at 38.3 yuan, Huowen at 38 yuan, Tokyo pointed at 35.5 yuan, Milu at 35.2 yuan, and Mizi at 32 yuan. Although the asking prices rose step by step afterwards, as it was Sunday, business was difficult, and there was no intention to purchase more. Sales gradually declined, and the situation flattened out again at noon. There were no changes at the close. Total transactions in the city were over 6,000 bags.</p>

<p>Yesterday's market remained sluggish. The guild's current spot price for 34 crude white sugar fell by 0.4 yuan. The price for both local and foreign stores was 56 yuan. The price of re-exported goods remained unchanged. Taikoo car white B mark rose slightly by 0.1 yuan, West store at 57.5 yuan, East store at 57 yuan, and the remaining CW mark and others were at 56 yuan. Prices for red lotus red and local cotton white remained unchanged. There were still no transactions for domestic sugar. According to letters from Zhangzhou, the ban on the transportation of Diaoqing sugar has been requested by local sugar merchants to be lifted. It may be released as usual soon, but foreign fees will inevitably double. According to the declared market price in Gulangyu, it should be around 48 or 49 yuan, but compared with the Shanghai market, the difference is 3 or 4 yuan, making it difficult to agree.</p>

<p>The market for Lead Association Steel has been quiet for a long time. However, recently, due to the commencement of operations by the thermos bottle factory in this street, the desolate atmosphere has turned into vigorous and excited. Yesterday, a total of 140 to 150 boxes were opened in the market. Due to strong confidence, the asking price was not weak. The current market price is 120 yuan per box (200 pounds), and double-linked goods also need to be sold for more than 130 yuan per box.</p>

<p>— Shen Xishen</p>
<p>Living is a big problem in life, so the living environment must also be paid attention to; it is not just about how convenient the transportation is or how fresh the air is (these two items require prior economic conditions), but it refers to the "people" environment. "Those who are near to vermilion get stained red, and those who are near to ink get stained black." A person who lives among good people will also become good, and vice versa, a person who lives in a den of bad people may also become bad. Mencius' mother's three moves were for the purpose of choosing a good living environment, and in the end, Mencius succeeded as a sage! Although we are not as good as Mencius' mother and Mencius, we should at least not live in an environment of evil people; Shanghai is a mixture of people from all directions, with good and bad mixed together, so the living environment must be paid attention to. My relative Zhao Jun, last year, because he did not choose his residence carefully, mistakenly moved into a place with swallow nests. One night, a lamp was knocked over in a swallow nest, causing a fire. Zhao Jun's clothes, chests and furniture were all burned down. This is the harm of choosing a bad neighbor. Therefore, whenever you move into a new home for the first time, within the possible scope, you must pay attention to whether the sub-landlord here and the nearby neighbors are honest and upright, whether there are bad people and idlers, or people with eccentric behavior. If you find that the environment here is not appropriate, it is best to move out as soon as possible! "Stay close to gentlemen and stay away from villains" is an ancient proverb! Mencius' mother's three moves can be used as our example!</p>

<p>Is it truly reasonable to eat three meals a day? Mr. Macfitten says: The best time to eat is when you are hungry and desire food. It is perhaps not reasonable for someone with a poor appetite to still eat three meals a day. As for the general public's diet, perhaps nothing is more reasonable than three meals a day. However, those who use their minds more than their bodies consider two meals a day to be appropriate.</p>

<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>It hasn't rained for over a month, and the weather is extremely dry. Although there has been some rain in the past few days, it hasn't been enough, so many people have sore throats this month. According to older generations, eating more radishes can prevent illness, especially eating them raw. What the older generations say is often not wrong, so let's eat more radishes. As for cooking, it's also very simple; for meat dishes, such as braised radish with pork, the flavor and oil of the meat penetrate deep into the radish, making it very flavorful. Using beef or mutton instead of pork is equally delicious. In addition, radish and pickled fresh meat stewed in white broth have a slight sweetness from the radish, and the radish is stewed until it is tender and melts in your mouth, truly a delicacy among meat dishes. For vegetarian dishes, you can cut the radish into rhomboid pieces or thick strips, add some garlic, and braise them together. Eating them hot is very satisfying. As for eating them raw, whether pickled with salt, submerged in soy sauce, mixed with sugar and vinegar, or preserved in lees, they are excellent accompaniments to porridge, with the lees flavor being the most delicious. There is also a partially cooked method, which involves shredding the radish, drizzling some oil, and mixing it with shredded jellyfish and scallions, which is crisp and refreshing whether served with porridge or rice.</p>

<p>— Jing Sheng</p>
<p>In Paris, since the outbreak of the war, the first to show a change in attitude were fashion designers; because as many as 80,000 French women had taken up arms, no one had the leisure to pay attention to new clothes. Therefore, clothing craftsmen racked their brains and invented a type of air-raid clothing. The design of this clothing is to connect the clothes and trousers into one piece, equipped with zippers, which is quick to put on, even at night. They advertised, "In the middle of the night or at dawn, when a siren suddenly sounds, women are startled from their dreams, and hastily rush into the shelter. It is unavoidable that improper attire may be unsightly. This air-raid clothing is based on this reason to meet the needs of women." So they had another moment of "prosperity."</p>
<h3 id="e89">Minor Notes on Dietary Health <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Jingren</p>
<p>Watermelon Seeds</p>
<p>Watermelon seeds were originally a leisure food for entertaining guests. Some people say they are unsanitary, and recently they have all been abandoned; but their function is detailed in the Materia Medica, which states that they can treat various diseases of the stomach and intestines, as well as digest food, lower gas, cleanse filth, and resolve phlegm, and also treat prolonged coughs with bloody sputum and constipation. Generally, the kernels of fruit seeds can slightly purge and direct heat downwards; there are many similar examples. Commonly, frying them is said to cleanse the lungs, moisten the intestines, harmonize the middle, and quench thirst. Ancient people valued dietary health, often benefiting people imperceptibly without their knowledge. The benefit of watermelon seeds lies especially in expelling the old and taking in the new, which has the same effect as knocking on teeth and swallowing saliva by Daoists. Because the tongue moves and produces saliva, it can transform starch that cannot be digested in gastric juice into [missing character], which is the same as the effect of injecting glucose into veins. Generally, when eating food, it must be chewed carefully, ensuring that the salivary glands [missing character] move and produce a large amount of saliva, which enters the stomach along with the food, so that its function is complete and nothing is wasted. Therefore, using watermelon seeds as a leisure food means chewing to produce saliva and aid digestion. [missing character] when entertaining female guests, this item is especially indispensable. Nibbling them while drinking tea or chatting idly is quite [missing character] refreshing. My teacher, Mr. Xiang Yuan, once wrote a "Gao Yang Tai" poem about it, saying, "[missing character] teeth slightly enclosing, cherry [missing character] slightly drawn, seeming to hear the clear sound of clappers. Occasionally opening to a smile, laughter lines first rise to the eyebrows. Hiding the hook only to divide between mad slaves drunk, difficult to guess secret [missing character] deep. Pour the wine heavily; don't fail to meet the watermelon season, a moment is worth a thousand gold. In front of people, black and white are originally difficult to distinguish, wondering if the fragrant snow by the plum blossoms falls on the mossy cen. A bit of dainty saliva, accidentally sticks to the silk collar. Wu Niang beautifully describes rose water, all to grind away idle time. Slowly reciting, one after another, becoming a fairy bird." It can be said to be a thorough description. The last two sentences refer to slightly cracking the tip of the watermelon seed, connecting them to form a chicken shape, and enticing children to eat it to remove internal heat, which is the same intention as paper kites.</p>
<h3 id="e90">The Problem of Dyeing Clothes (Part 1) <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Xu Wo Sheng</p>
<p>Since the dramatic changes in foreign exchange rates, dyes have become a major issue, and bleaching costs have also increased more than fourfold. Papermakers and dyers have consulted me, [missing character], so I will explore the following: Our country is originally a yellow race, and has always valued the color yellow. The emperor wore yellow, while the empress wore green on the outside and yellow on the inside. Green is the original color of hemp, and the yellow lining used was mostly the emperor's old clothes. We often use the face of a long garment to make a lining, and even if it is torn and patched, it is still fine. In theatrical performances, meritorious officials wear red, high officials wear blue, and lowly servants wear black. Generally, the difference in clothing color is determined by the amount of raw materials produced and limited; the same is true for paper. Honored individuals use yellow, auspicious occasions use red, light mourning uses blue, and heavy mourning uses white. From this, it can be seen that yellow is the primary color, and the color between yellow and red is ochre, which is the dyeing of gardenia and madder. Therefore, Sima Qian's "Biographies of the Money-Makers" says that a thousand acres of gardenia and madder can bring wealth. Gardenia and madder are both wild plants. Because no one cultivated them, they were rare and expensive. And once they became exclusive items for emperors, kings, and ministers, they were used less, and there was no need to plant much. But planting a thousand acres made one rich, because of the demand from the rich. Yellow hemp was used for writing only for the emperor's edicts, because hemp could be used for clothing, so its overuse was not allowed. After hemp is retted, it can be softened by soaking it in alkali, and pounding it into silk. The "Book of Songs" says, "The pond at the east gate can ret hemp," and the title of the ci poem "Hu Pounding Silk" refers to its production method. Generally, pounding silk finely originated in Hu clothing, and our country's hemp clothing was not finely made, so filial sons had the system of coarse mourning, showing that they did not seek beauty, but did not dare to damage the remains. After hemp is pounded into silk, its color turns grayish-white, not the primary color of yellow, so it is dyed with gardenia to make it ochre yellow. If it is dyed with madder, it turns red, and old yellow clothes can also be dyed with madder to become ochre. Xu Ce in the theater wears ochre clothes, which are generally imperial yellow clothes that have been re-dyed to distinguish status. As for blue, indigo plants are everywhere. It turns blue when it encounters [missing character] and red when it encounters acid. Red and blue intermingled become purple, so there is a saying: "Take off the blue shirt and put on the purple robe," meaning that the status difference is also one level. The superposition of red, yellow, and blue becomes black, which is called xuanqing, but is actually black; black is the color of water, due to the accumulation of much blue; xuan is the color of the sky, also the same principle; the color of plants and trees is the same, chlorophyll is the color between blue and yellow. Therefore, I believe that the national and household systems of frugality and etiquette mean that every thread and strand is not easily obtained. The ruler bestows upon his ministers, from yellow to ochre, from [missing character] to red, from red to purple, that is, from gardenia and madder to indigo. All colors between red and yellow are called warm colors, which are the sunlight of the sun, so men who love activity like them, because their natures are similar. Leaning towards blue is a cold color, which is the moonlight of the moon, so women who love quiet like it; and white-clothed scholars use the original color because they are too poor to dye, only using the original color to achieve cleanliness, not necessarily bleaching as is done today. Bleaching coarse cloth originally relied on long exposure to the sun, so wetting the cloth and drying it on the grass utilized the nutrients released by the grass due to sun exposure to reduce the lightness contained in the pigment. Paper is also whitened by long exposure to the sun, not by deliberately seeking whiteness; failure to operate and prolonged exposure to the outside caused this, as evidenced by frost grass turning white. The blue bamboo cloth shirts we used to wear gradually faded to white after long exposure to the sun, which is further evidence. [missing character] indigo from indigo plants is the common method in our country, but because it fades in the sun, it has been replaced by foreign indigo. Foreign indigo does not fade because of carbonization, which prevents it from being oxidized, because it contains oil, which prevents it from dissolving in water, so its pigment can be fixed. Today, dyers use "Taigu oil," which combines oiliness and alkalinity to resist acid. In fact, our country originally had the method of mordanting with alum, which also does not fade. Papermakers use [missing character] to make Jian Huang paper, which is also a secret of this tradition.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Winter Vacation Homework <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Chi Qiang</p>
<p>As the winter vacation arrives, tens of thousands of young people are already spending their leisure time in warm homes. After grading the Chinese examination papers, I immediately received a letter from the school authorities asking me to assign vacation homework to the students, so that they would not waste their time during the winter vacation. This is indeed an important measure for the students' studies, so I quickly began writing. Some schools, because of the short winter vacation, did not issue vacation homework to the students. For students who intend to be lazy, it is completely "perfect", but those who are diligent also know that it is a pity to waste the vacation. Therefore, in addition to having this homework quickly mimeographed by the school, I am also publishing it here for the selection of young people on the isolated island who have a winter vacation:</p>
<p>(1) Write one sheet of large regular script (must be copied from a model) and one hundred characters of small regular script every day.</p>
<p>(2) Recite aloud the literary pieces you liked from the past semester every day, and silently recognize their structure and form, as well as explore their wording and sentence construction.</p>
<p>(3) Translate one piece of classical Chinese prose or poetry that you have read into vernacular Chinese.</p>
<p>(4) Read one or two new readings. (This type of new reading does not need to be assigned by the teacher, but is freely selected based on each student's own preferences. For example: short stories, essays, dramas, stories, etc. are all good; even biographies of famous people, fairy tales, etc. are fine. New books on new knowledge are of course good, but old books with artistic value are also good. In short: each person reads one type, regardless of length. After reading, be sure to make an outline, and express your opinions and criticisms.</p>
<p>Additional note: (1) (3) (4) Three types must be submitted to the school for review before the start of the next semester. The second type must be reported at any time during the start of classes, after reciting or exploring one's feelings.</p>
<p>After I had completed the "Winter Vacation Homework" on Chinese, I thought of a few old things, which are closely related to the students' attitude towards Chinese, and it might as well write them here as a conclusion.</p>
<p>Reports state that "In last year's college entrance examination, the performance of the test takers was mediocre, the technical skills in Chinese were extremely poor, the thinking was unclear, and there were many unexpected jokes in the history and geography of the country... It is increasingly felt that secondary education in the past was chaotic and unrealistic, and university education was surprisingly new but did not cultivate the fundamentals, and it seems necessary to revise and correct this. For knowledge leaders in general to guide young people, they must be strict and not forget the fundamentals by following customs."</p>
<p>This "extremely poor technical skills," this "unclear," this "joke" and "unexpected" are the shame of the test takers, and are also caused by the "forgetting the fundamentals" in the student era. Students "forget the fundamentals," and teachers "do not cultivate the fundamentals," and this is why the jokes that were intentionally imagined and expected come out.</p>
<p>To cultivate the "fundamentals" from now on, one must cherish the precious time of the winter vacation, even if it is short, at least one or two volumes of books can be read.</p>
<h3 id="e92">How to Utilize the Long Winter Vacation <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi Zhi</p>
<p>After a busy period of examinations, schools have a two- or three-week winter break, which gives every young student a considerable amount of time to rest. However, how will we utilize and spend this long winter vacation? Therefore, I have put forward the following plan as a reference for everyone.</p>
<p>First: Utilize existing books and add a round of review and research. We know that books must be read and reviewed more, but on weekdays, everyone is limited by the school's set curriculum schedule, and there are several subjects every week, and each subject must have several new books. Although teachers teach step by step, students suffer from not having the opportunity to read each lesson carefully and think and research in detail. What's more, the current poor reading environment and unstable daily life naturally further reduce the time and space for students to work hard and strive for progress. However, books must be read more to gain benefits, and knowledge can only grow after integration and understanding. Since we don't have much time to review on weekdays, then the long winter vacation is the best time for us to utilize and add a round of review and research.</p>
<p>Second: Organize winter break societies and experience group living. Originally, people cannot live alone, and society is the result of our human combination. Then, the development of group life must be trained from an early age. In this way, in the winter vacation, if several like-minded people are invited to live together, so that they can learn from each other and sharpen themselves, wouldn't it be the best and most fulfilling state of life? Because in this, there can be various positive entertainments, and we can hone our ability to handle affairs, and we can also improve our personal ambition and character cultivation. Of course, reading clubs, ball research associations, drama troupes, and training and correction of thoughts and beliefs can all be established and organized one by one.</p>
<p>Third: Experience society and develop the habit of service. Young students usually have no time to practice the habit of serving the community because they are busy with their schoolwork. However, people are born to step into society to serve, but it is only a matter of time when people serve society. Then, in order to have rich experience and be able to do the job happily in the future, we should start experiencing it at this moment. Now, during this long winter vacation, everyone has two or three weeks of vacation time, and there are youth associations and other organizations that give students contact and serve society, serving the masses in many, many careers. We should bravely participate in them and work hard carefully and responsibly. In this way, the training now will mature, and later it will be the success of personal service to society, and it will also be the foundation for creating a great career.</p>
<p>In short, under the environment of Shanghai today, the situation of students is indeed extremely depressing. Now that the long, long, cold winter vacation is approaching, how will everyone spend it safely? This is indeed a question worth considering. Therefore, I offer the above "winter break plans." Of course, there are many, many other tasks, as long as everyone works hard and happily without losing their ambition, without harming their body, and without violating or hindering the goals of the masses, the light is right in front of us.</p>

<p>Chapter 20: The World's Transportation Shares the Same Language; Child Education Rewards Scholarship and Pities Talent</p>
<p>How should teacher exchanges happen? It means that teachers from Europe and America are sent to China, and Chinese teachers are sent to Europe and America. Many European and American teachers have been sent to China, so there is no need to talk about them. The number of Chinese teachers sent to Europe and America has also gradually increased recently. In the future, because of teacher exchanges, Chinese scholars will also teach at universities in Europe and America. But these lecturers all have a thorough understanding of European and American languages and writing. They spread China's inherent knowledge to various countries. They still speak foreign languages and write foreign characters, only translating the Chinese language once. Now, after the teacher exchanges, European and American students are also requesting that they be taught Chinese language and writing. Why? These students are aspiring to come to the East and to China. They have a little foundation in Chinese language and writing in their own countries, which makes it much easier. Fifty years ago, I saw a copy of an English textbook, which also had a lesson about China. In the textbook, in order to make it easier for students to understand, there are always illustrations. The illustration depicts a Chinese sage, Confucius, and his disciples. But Confucius was wearing a Manchurian-style court dress with a rosary, a mandarin jacket, and a warm hat, and a queue was dragged behind his head. Dressing up Confucius like this really makes people sigh about dishevelled hair and buttoning on the left. However, the artist thought that Chinese people are like this, and Confucius is Chinese, so he should dress like this, isn't this very consistent with logic? This is because Westerners don't understand Chinese history and customs! There was also an American missionary who was preaching in Suzhou, and he also learned a few sentences of Suzhou dialect. He actually went to the vegetable market himself. Suzhou people could barely understand this kind of foreign accent in Suzhou dialect. But when he went to a chicken stall, he asked, "Is your chicken male or female?" The seller was at a loss. What male or female? Later, he thought about it and couldn't help but laugh. It turned out that he was asking whether it was a rooster or a hen. So he said, "Foreign gentleman! We say male and female for human, not chickens!" The people in the vegetable market laughed too. The missionary then understood that chickens should be called male and female, and not male and female. But he was unconvinced. Chinese books, as well as the mouths of people in other places, also call it [missing character] rooster and hen. Since it can be called rooster and hen, why can't it be called male chicken and female chicken? The Chinese language is really mysterious. In fact, this is not mysterious, but change. There are also many changes in the languages of European and American countries, and people who read foreign languages all understand this. It is because their spoken and written language are relatively consistent, and the territory of a country is quite small, so it cannot be as complex as Chinese dialects. This is because China has a large land and a large population. [missing character] (230)</p>
