<p>社評</p>
<h3>美國政治季節中的遠東政策</h3>
<p>美國現任總統羅斯福氏接受了蟬聯第三任總統候選人的推選之後，從目前以迄大選爲止的一時期中，美國朝野應怎樣繼續推進其强毅的國際反侵略政策？本報昨日評論，旣槪陳吾們所期望。今日請申論爾後必然的動向。</p>
<p>昨今美系華盛頓電訉：一謂今年國會並無任何意向，促使美國在遠東採取新政策；又謂彼等不信國會將執行任何明晰的步驟，以對付日本；又謂一般觀察家茲皆注意羅總統將爲民主黨孤立的外交政策拘束到何種程度：又謂羅總統在大選打敗其政敵之前，一切政策，殆將採取安穩的中庸途徑。凡此所傳，其中百分之若干，是消息性質，揭暴了美國政情的內容；其餘百分之若干，是議論性質，說明了美國政情的影響。兩種性質所佔百分比的多寡。任何人所無從辨別。但以美國民治精神的發皇，以美國兩黨競選前的政治策略，以美國政史所示歷來沿襲的事例，任何人無疑於上述消息與議論的皆極中肯。我們還以爲：在政治昌明的國家如美國，人民是政治動物，這些是政洽問題，當前是政治季節，由此一半消息一半議論，將政治氣息發揮到淋漓盡致了。根本是一個政治的人類社會，便根本不能以任何多數的信仰，或健全的理由，或特別的事實，袪除政治氣息至於凈盡而臻於超政治的明期之域。這原來不但在美國若此，又不但在任何民治國家若此，即在極端褊狹的國家主義者控制之下的國家，無論他的統治者主觀上憧憬着超政治，事實上却亦不免若此。大凡最富於政治意識的人士所最易於迷惑，而其實不容太迷惑的，要須知道政治氣息究竟並非國族決定一切的主宰因素。若爲國族決定一切而取捨不離乎政治氣息，若觀察或議論國族的一切而祗根據了政治氣息，則祗是一個政客，一個策士，一個縱橫論家。若使如此，是國族落沒的朕兆，是民治政制毀滅的種因。</p>
<p>具體論之目前的美國：目前雖因改選總統而屆臨四年一度最重要的政治季節，目前雖因國際政策流爲政爭工具而等於政洽問題；然有若干嚴重事項，尤其有關遠東的，或在實際上，已經達到了必須美國及時決定取捨的歧途；或在遽急演進之中，推其所至，顯然不待舉行大選的十一月，逼使美國不得不及時宣示明確的態度；更可能的產生何種意外嚴重的新紛擾，將使美國有隨時立即應付的必要；凡此三類事項，我們不信賢明的美國朝野，乃不能自抑其政治氣息至於最低限度，而使今後三個月內擺在眼前的何種國際政策問題，竟因政治季節而滯留於國內政治問題的領域。試作幾個並非不可能的假定事例吧：假定日本近衛內閣完成之後，果如近來日本人方面所吹聽，他國人方面所傳說，在外交上或他種實際行動上，悍然侵襲了美國遠東政策上或太平洋安全上所絕對不能容忍的範疇；假定有此紐約時報遠東特派員亞朋所受侮辱，其性質更嚴重倍蓗的案件，繼續不斷，變本加厲而來：假定英國再藉口於美國在遠東意態行動的疲軟，再以萬不得已的姿態，而準備作何蔑視條約義務，犧牲及於美國與他國利益的退縮行動。凡此假定，任何人所不敢保證其絕不成立；况以近年國際變局愈演愈烈，距常情常理常道愈去愈遠，雖則暴發而為所關更遠大痛切的無數事變，亦不算意外，不能視為杞憂天傾。故在美國的政治季節之中，實行大選之前，並不能斷言美國當局對付國際，必取消極。</p>
<p>更以政爭的政略而論，美國民主黨與共和黨，朝野對立。但在競選前向彼國民所宣示的國際政策，祗有口吻程度之差，並無行止背馳之處；故國際政策雖不幸而淪陷於國內政治問題的領域之內，然兩黨旣取之為政爭工具，反而很可能的什反侵略與不妥協的共通原則下，竭力競進，終達全國兩黨意思力量融合爲一的飽和點，恰値政治季節，演說羣衆面前，正義的光輝，國族榮譽的火燄，可使貌似安穩中庸的消極者，百啄莫辯，置身無地。最近將來，日本近衛內閣至少在彼內在的政治原因上，對美國殆有不可避免的刺激；昨日紐約電稱，羅斯福政府雖欲在大選前避免與外國爭執，然遠東近日所發生的反美事件，將使一般人以緩和爲可恥；伏着種種微妙的因緣，絕無理由斷言於美國對遠東行將暫時滯留於消極，亦即不難覘知其動向。</p>

<p>華盛頓　外交界頃信、美國或將討論禁止碎鐵運日、以對抗日本之封銷滇緬公路、外交界此項信念、係基於以下二種事實、（一）國務卿赫爾之反對封鎖滇緬路、（二）史汀生上校入閣任陸長、（三）最近國會授權羅總統、控制主要國防原料之出口、而碎鐵一項、自必在取締之列、美國若干有勢力之私人及私人團體、久已主張禁運碎鐵赴日、但國務部因法律上無此項行動之根據、迄遲遲未能實行、消息靈通方面稱、史汀生上校曾屢决主張、禁止以軍器、彈藥及一切軍用原料運往日本、渠於一月間、且會公然致函紐約時報、籲請美國採取此項行動云、（二十二日合衆社電）</p>

<h3>德報評論　美國黃金政策　歐洲經濟生活改組　西半球黃金無出路</h3>
<p>柏林　昨日德意志總彙報經濟主筆溫士楚博士、就戰後賠款及世界經濟問題、以「由二〇〇〇年回顧」爲題、發表一文稱、「一九四〇年秋、美國擁有世界存金百分之八十、美國因戰事所獲之利、爲數爲鉅、此種情形、與世界大戰後正復相同、美人相信黃金可使其對於新經濟關係有支配之權、但情形之發展、證明非是、前此歐洲之幣制、以金為本位、但因德之勝英、英鎊業憶崩潰、歐洲之經濟生活、業不用金本位而經改組、與人之期望正相反、戰勝國不要求、如凡爾賽各國之所爲、以黃金或精製之貨品以充賠款、往年以根據黃金貿易之辦法抵制極權國清算貿易辦法之種種企圖業已失敗、目前之情形已變、因歐洲各銀行之拒絕購買黃金、及世界經濟按照極權國原理之發展、於是所餘之黃金均運往美國、因美國囤積巨量黃金之結果、世界之其餘各國除在經濟方面抵制美國外、別無他法、美國自其黃金夢中驚醒、發現欲以黃金購貨、但無人需要黃金矣、雖用各種方法在國外尋覓黃金買主、均歸失敗、在西半球黃金完全無出路、南美洲請美國推銷其過剩之出產品、美國旣無能爲力、南美洲乃再向其舊市場推銷、雖在戰事發生之後、仍與歐洲進行一種以貨易貨之交易？歐洲雖吸收此項貿易、但同時欲開發非洲、作爲原料之來源、此時美國已减低黃金買價、終於完全停止購金、但此項措置、使黃金價値益見低落、此時華盛頓擬貸金債與歐洲但均被拒絕、最後美國擬捐購其黃金之半數於歐洲、建立一金本位之幣制、以供世界貿易之用爲條件、但此項禮物亦被拒絕、至是美國之造幣廠乃鑄造金元以引起個人對黃金之興趣、但此種企圖亦歸失敗、無人欲携帶笨重之金條、人民均仍喜用銀行之鈔票及支票、無人欲以金付款僅照其入款所能購之貨額估定所値之數耳、最後乃將黃金鎔化、鑄成金器充美國公使及大使餐桌之用、爲紀念過去之歲月、華爾街改名爲黃金街」、此乃黃金源源流入美國之結局、（二十二日海通電）</p>
<h3>美國將舉行　陸軍大操　參加兵士達卅萬　為二十年來僅見</h3>
<p>紐約　美國陸軍將於下星期內、舉行大操、聞參加之兵士將有卅萬之衆、規模如此宏大之會操、爲廿年來美國所僅見、（二十二日海通社電）</p>
<h3>美在荷印　政治利益　較經濟利益為大</h3>
<p>愛特爾斯坦　據太平洋國際關係研究會之研究報告稱、美國於物質資源方面、所仰賴於英屬馬來聯邦者、實較荷屬東印度爲巨、美國在荷屬東印度之經濟利益、比較爲輕、而在該地之政治利益則甚巨、太平洋國陸關係研究會專家齊爾、於研究亞洲現存各種經濟的及政治的因素中、發覺美國對於任何足使廣大的廉價物質供給、入於征服者手中之局勢變遷、決不能安然坐視、邇來之歐洲局勢、不特形成荷蘭之被佔領、且使英國亦有淪爲被征服之危險、此種局勢、乃使上述之美國態度益覺明瞭、齊氏之報告繼稱、就拉丁美洲之橡皮生產及人造橡皮生產兩者而觀、美國於經濟上仰賴於荷印者殊爲希微、因現時美國業已與巴西締結協定、該協定中曾規定、美國將援叻巴西大量生產種種爲美國所需之亞熱帶農產品、是等農產品、包括橡皮、金雞納、植物油及若干種之硬木等、此等物品、均係美國仰賴亞洲諸國之供給者、再拉丁美洲於防止橡皮生產上之病害、業已費甚大之努力、而大致已克服此種困難、據可靠消息稱、此項橡皮之生產、可於五年之中、大大發展而應商業之需、關於錫一項、玻璃維亞及比利時剛果之錫礦、其產量雖不足以應世界之需、但於緊急需要、亦可供暫時之應付、是以關於橡皮及錫兩項、美國於緊要時、尚可取給於美洲焉、該報告續云、美國之非常關懷荷印運命、顯然不僅在於投資及貿易數字方面、實際上、吾人提出投資及貿易數字兩端而論反足證明美國在荷印之經濟利益、不甚重要、吾人苟就荷印單獨研究、所謂美國之軍事原料仰給於荷印之論證、亦被打破、蓋荷印之橡皮、爲美國所消費者、不過百分之二十五、錫不過百分之五、縱令荷印被他國佔領、則阿基比拉哥、馬來亞、緬甸、越南、甚至暹邏之大部輸出品、是否卽被阻止、尚屬疑問、因生產者固願以其貨品售諸良好之顧客也、設因政治上關係、佔領者努力禁阻是此輸出品之裝運、則是否能達到全部封鎖之目的、亦屬疑問、因護航隊仍得將此等被禁阻之貨品運入美國、設蘇彝士運河及直布羅陀無法通過、變繞道好望角以達美國之東岸、再荷印輸入之品、就所謂主要貨品一之眼光觀之、與其他東南亞洲諸國輸入者比較、並不形成重要、（二十二日合衆社電）</p>

<h3>金融　美商接本國來電　美金有不准拋空說　美行反有吸收套出先令　市勢乃見英鬆美緊之象</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市況、滙豐掛牌、無顯著變化、因經營者暫作觀望、交易轉穩、走勢　呈英鬆美緊之態、此乃聞上週六美商銀行、接美政府來電、不准拋空美匯、故本日美行頻頻吸收美匯、而套買出先令、又洋行等均需要美匯頭寸、於是美匯潛勢微軟、英金稍見硬化、晚收與午收價相同、英金為三辨士八七五、美匯六元一二五、較之上週六收市、英硬〇一五六二五、美緊〇三一二五、期貨市面乏人顧問、故更屬平穩、</p>
<p>洋行亦有結款</p>
<p>晨初以匯兌英對美不動、對滬縮〇六二五、對法無市、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辨士八四三七五、美匯六元一五六二五、較之上星期六收、美平英緊〇一五六二五、乃匯兌微落之關係、開後美行首懷供意、市面略硬、計美行與外行對做現先令三辨士八四三七五至八七五、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉亦無增減、此後洋行稍有結款、致求過於供、價即回軟、計洋行扒進外行有利現美匯為六元一二五、嗣以英行麥加利等前來塞出、且買戶頗少、故市象極靜、而麥加利售予美行現美匯復告六元一五六二五、迄收盤時止、仍缺乏變化、結果英金三辨士八七五、美匯六元一二五、八月份英金三辨士八四三七五、美匯六元〇六二五、比晨間現貨英長〇三一二五、美則緊〇三一二五、八月份英平美亦軟〇三一二五、</p>
<p>午後交易不多</p>
<p>午後市面仍告平靜、交易做開不多、計華商銀行賣予外行本月份美匯均為六元一五六二五、先令不聞成交、晚收價與午收價完全相同、英金三辨士八七五、美匯六元一二五、八月份英金三辨士八四三七五、美匯六元〇六二五、較之上週末、現貨英長〇一五六二五、美緊〇三一二五、八月份美平、英亦硬〇三一二五、</p>
<p>香港美匯不定</p>
<p>香港二十二日（週一）電、今晨匯市開盤告平、惟美匯仍形動盪、英日及申匯現貨、均無變動、美匯現貨緊一二五、為二十三元七五、九時五十五分美匯現貨續緊〇六二五、為二十三元六八七五、十一時三十分告平、各匯概無榮辱、延至下午二時三十分、仍站原盤、均無上落、</p>
<p>天津匯價見緊</p>
<p>天津二十二日（週一）電、今晨匯市開盤呆滯、英美匯現貨各緊〇三一二五、英匯為三便士五九三七五、美匯為五元七五、申匯不動、仍站一百〇七元二角半、「聯鈔」暗盤微賤一角半、為九十三元六角半、</p>
<h3>拋空復起　金市下挫</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市況、欲漲不能、此以人心買進興趣缺乏、拋空者倒有所見、雖匯市美匯走緊、而金價自入五千三百元關內後、難以透出、晨初為五千三百元、較上週六跌四十五元、嗣為銀號幫略吸、抬高二十元、奈不久錢兌業忽大量拋空、即挫落至二百八十元、雖銀號幫散戶曾復收進、但午收仍祗五千二百九十元、後市開出銀號即賣為五千二百七十五元低盤、賴證券幫等維持、回好十餘元、惟需要終少、晚收僅為五千二百八十五元、結果軋跌六十元、全日交易不多、約二千兩光景、銀樓飾金終則掛小十元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤跌六十元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以匯市趨鬆、人心略挫、開市即撳低四十五元、銀號對做十兩、為五千三百元、嗣賴某銀號暨現金號吸收、曾回升二十元、銀號進同業等數十兩、為五千三百二十元、此後因某錢兌業拋出有數、復做小四十元、錢兌業出銀號十兩、遜為五千二百八十元、旋某錢兌業中止拋塞、且反來復進少數、而斯時人心尚佳、不乏乘低撈入做多、重又回高三十元、錢兌業進銀號五十兩、為五千三百十元、十一時許買者減少、散多見景作了結之舉、遂再降落二十元、銀號出金號二十兩、為五千二百九十元、後金號售予銀號及同業各十兩、均為五千二百八十五元作晚收價、結果比上週末回落六十元、收後市勢尚堅、照收價高五元、尚無賣戶、全天四十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十數元、收進減低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金掛小十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸五百五十元、迨至正午減低十元、此後則無變更、計大同行改選五百四十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進減低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>一周來之匯市　外匯前途之觀察</h3>
<p>據上海經濟咨詢所報告上週市起伏極平，美匯最高為六元二五，最低五元八四三七五，英匯最高為三辨士九三七五，最低三辨士八四三七五。</p>
<p>中間雖以廢除自由英鎊之傳聞，一度稍有上下，然刺激極微，蓋自歐事擴大以來，國際之支付，大抵以美元結價，即使英美匯率昇至四元零二分之法定價格，本埠之匯市未必與之發生聯繫，考上週其他起伏因素，據市場所傳，尚有下列數端：</p>
<p>（一）國際路綫被阻，</p>
<p>（二）軍事行動轉劇。</p>
<p>（三）和平謠言嫋嫋，</p>
<p>（四）南進漸趨積極。</p>
<p>按最近市場走勢及其對各項消息之反應，似與平時不同，當去歲美匯自六元大關回長至九元以上，所長約百分之五十有奇，然隨即轉縮，未稍猶豫，而此次自四元六八五長至六元以上，所長亦不下百分之五十，為時二月，仍在盤旋，且市場對於各消息之反應，亦甚平平，例如國際路綫被阻，軍事行動轉劇等等，俱足使外匯看緊，而實際並未發生任何作用，再如和平消息既經否認，亦未能使匯市軟化，足見脚地堅硬，國人對法幣之信念，益臻穩定。</p>
<p>近衛登台，據報載南進政策，勢將待機進行，一旦成為事實，彼邦軍事力量，勢必集中於新目標，則中國之戰局，或將改觀，而視綫他移，本地情形或將反形安定，　世界戰局擴大，美國牽入漩渦之可能性益以增加，則逃避之資金，必將返回，而中國外國銀行存款，亦將起微妙作用，不免拋出外匯以謀應付，同時大戰展開，法幣之外匯對象，益入險境，且以交通阻滯，實際需要減少，則國人對外匯之興趣，益形淡薄，而本埠向以套匯著稱之銀行，日來活動已見減少，如南進積極，美國或進一步實施禁運，則彼時法幣之需要增加用以購買中國之原料，則所謂南進者，或將反有造於匯市矣。</p>
<h3>外幣復疲</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市況、烚赤又復趨跌、英美金鎊亦各跌一元半、英金票供求均勻、市價站平、美金票仍在狹小範圍內盤旋、卒告下跌七分、坎拿大票趨勢甚軟、日金票需要又殷、市價復漲、晚市為一元二角一分半、朝鮮票需要奇殷、晚市高至一元零五分半、香港票亦不乏需要、市價漲起二分、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆價不鬆動　都為運輸不暢關係</h3>
<p>雜糧中之豆類交易、狹隘異常、市場中各幫客銷祗有問價、而無實交、所靠本街幾十包動化、故市氣殊形衰弱、惟市價因搬運困難、成本昂貴、貨主大都不願賤脫、故趨勢尚不過修、刻下各種高品貨盤居平淡之局、中次貨則依然挫落、昨統祗成交青島黃豆二百包、價詳市價攔、硤石黃豆五十包、浦東杜豆一百五十包、張堰杜豆五十包、北港青皮蠶豆五十包、閔行南港青皮蠶豆一百餘包、瀏河蠶豆五十餘包、蕪湖小粒白皮蠶豆一百包、及明光菉荳一百七十包而已、</p>
<h3>糧食　常粳又叩七十元關　昨日到一百五千包　洋米仍在堅持不放</h3>
<p>米市昨日假後初開、本街莊客戶以搬運護照、為期日　、難以久待、客販遂利用浙閩海疆不靖、堅守不出、全市遂呈出少進多、形勢激盪、續起漲風、結果各價在喊聲步步上升中、較之週前又增一元、收盤一號陳西貢為五十六元半、新尖五十六元、二號五十三元半、五十三元、陳五十四元、一號暹羅五十六元半、五十六元、二號五十三元、火絞五十六元、五十五元七角、香港尖五十五元、五十四元半、二號五十三元八角、東京砶尖高自五十元、次至四十七元、碎尖四十三元半、次之四十一元半、米菉四十五元半、四十五元、</p>
<p>路貨方面、貨主亦以後定既難通劃、且有輪船風險關係、對於存米乃不肯賤脫、且新到各批路貨除汕幫收現付裝外、貨方復有直接配與本客、故上月念號裝即交貨與上月廿六裝路貨、貨方均視奇貨可居、蓋市上浮貨已磬、而客幫因其新鮮而歡迎之、廿六號裝開價尚為六十一元二角、比上週六祗大二角、旋自六十一元半六十二元至步達六十三元、比上週激昂二元、廿號裝即交貨開價立跳二元為六十二元、旋又加起三角為六十二元三角、較漲有二元三角矣、現米亦漲元外至二元不一、全日成交現米約八九千包、而回籠原包計有五百多噸云、</p>
<p>粳糯國米共到一千三四百包、其中又以粳貨居多、傳聞明暗盤交易、因洋米續昂、遂亦活絡、所以售價粳米並提元　、常幫鮮特清粳又達七十元大關、特清粳六十八九元、無錫清粳六十八元、常州蘇崑粳高自六十七八元、次至宿六十二三元、青泗薄稻六十八元、南港斛早六十一元、糯米去路稍見較遜、僅加半元、溧陽特元六十四元半、金壇特元六十四元、六十三元半、常丹百元六十二三元、香港糯六十一元云、</p>
<p>洋米又有到滬、前日怡和洋行泰生輸到埠、自海防運來二千零九十五包、香港運來一萬二千九百四十二包、共一萬五千零三十七包、到滬適值星期、始於昨晨起卸、</p>
<p>小麥貨主　欲取償於華廠　亦苦於不能飛渡　雜牌粉充斥市場</p>
<p>麵粉　昨為週初之期、現粉交易、續告清淡、蓋以目下日廠粉與內地雜牌粉充斥市場、致華粉銷路日減、而廠方以原料收買困難、故亦並不遷就、二號粉廠盤仍須十六元、本街進戶、大都嫌昂、兩廠批出僅三四千包、其他各種雜粉、莫不互相傾軋、每多暗販配客、聞鳳凰牌祗開十四元七八角、金山牌十五元六七角、但均在擯持聲中、</p>
<p>小麥　昨市仍黯淡、虹口方面新到各貨、除少數配與日廠外、一般貨主、欲求善價售與華廠、終以不能運入租界為憾、華廠接洽擬定之洋麥、亦以運輸及船位問題、致未成議、故市面益趨沉靜云、</p>
<h3>證券　內債稍稍回好</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨市經過四日之盤小後、又稍稍轉堅、而交易則逐步清減、十六日之活潑氣象、已成陳跡、惟未可遽認為無望、數日小跌、亦不過大漲後之回風耳、刻下傳言龐雜、莫可究詰、投機家乃亦乘機觀變、但仍不能遽為各方所重視、但其仍在醞釀中、則為不可掩之事實、本息問題、經過一度謠言、現已確定無問題、息票九五折有人收買、前途當尚有曙光、昨日形勢多空雙方陣容毫無紊亂狀態、仍為以前一貫宗旨、兩市多空競爭結果、市況由低轉高、結果各債微好二角至三角半、成交總數共計六十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>類別　最高　最低　收盤　比前日</p>
<p>統甲　六二·八〇　六二·七〇　六二·七五　漲·三〇</p>
<p>統乙　五三·三五　五三·二〇　五三·三五　漲·三五</p>
<p>統丙　五一·八〇　五一·五〇　五一·六五　漲·二〇</p>
<p>統丁　五〇·五五　五〇·五〇　五〇·五五　漲·二〇</p>
<p>統戊　五一·〇〇　五〇·九〇　五〇·〇〇　漲·〇</p>
<p>股票交易、成交中國國貨公司股一百股、價為二十六元、</p>
<p>又眾業公所昨日股市、上午略有獲利了結、下午人心突然向榮、實業股與橡皮股二者同時轉堅、三家信託公司股由低價高翔、漲勢有力、</p>
<h3>紗花　雙馬期紗　廠開三千六百包</h3>
<p>紗市呆滯而無特色、但一般同業及散戶投機者、依然　緊不放鬆、所以市情遂成擯持之局、然實銷仍屬寥落不堪、故市面異常蕭條、場上一片冷索索象也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開人氣渙散、加之報載浙東方面、戰事緊張、售者並未起勁、二十支雙馬開價為九百十五元、跌至九百十元、但低價一開、一般巨戶仍按兵不動、僅小戶賣出、及搶帽子之輩、稍有放出、因之檯面尚好、在九百二十元左右徘徊甚久、時近十一時、聞外匯無變遷、較之搶帽子者鑒於無念可轉、祗得活動抵補、於此市盤徐徐回上至九百二十九元、收盤稍挫、查半日開成交統計一千五百七十包、行情漲六元、昨有棉紗五十件自香港運來、今日有七十件運廈門、茲將各幫口買去之額量錄左、</p>
<p>同行一、四九〇　香港　七〇</p>
<p>內地　一〇　統計　一、五七〇</p>
<p>午後消息申新九廠開出二十包、價為九百四十五元、每包收定洋一百十元、期限八·九月份出清、都係同行中接受云、</p>
<h3>棉市仍在靜寂中</h3>
<p>現棉交易仍少發展、此因外棉仍向下屬、加之絲銷不暢、故無大量生意、惟申新九廠已開出大批棉紗、對於原料或有添補之舉、所以人心稍振云、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、頗呈疲乏之狀、因棉區氣候良好、及一部份現貨售出、結果收盤價格、較之上日跌落三四磅音、印度棉市昨日連同預測跌六羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來殊為靜寂、各方俱在觀望中、廠方存底不豐、市上存棉亦不多、故市況稍有轉機後、廠方即將購買也、同業間交易、日來亦靜寂殊甚也、</p>
<h3>絲茶　生絲來源已斷　大都在內地成交</h3>
<p>昨橫濱絲市、現貨一千三百五十元、近期一千三百八十五元、遠期一千三百八十三元、計與上週尾之記錄、無甚上落、洋行絲銷有零星交易、紐約頗有來賬、奈內地絲經不能來滬、現輯里經上升討價三千四百元、與日商在內地吸購者相差近千元、白廠八一分昨做開五千一百五十元、惟包額無多、目下「統制」壓力日漸加緊、然則外銷絲市、行將停頓、蓋英法洋行無力與日商相競爭也、同時不能出運之絲經、每多有內地成交、絲市重心有轉變場地可能、本埠絲廠目下因滬浙交通斷絕、生絲原料已陷絕境、最近已有若干絲廠　續停車、且前途亦頗渺茫　云、</p>
<p>今日有絲經九包運香港、又五包及茶葉二百箱、運往新加坡、</p>
<h3>煤炭　煤球暗市連跌</h3>
<p>煤球行情、近日同業傾軋、跌價競爭、益形白熱化、除前週末方減盤子、日昨某廠大分銷打單、暗市又跌六元、計開自車每噸一百二十六元、送到另加車力、於是小廠為生存計、亦跟蹤減盤、故本街門莊價、亦紊亂非凡、高低不一云、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗白微鬆</h3>

<h3>利令智昏</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>現在我有一個難問題要求你代我解決，想先生是讀者的導師，或不致拒絕我底要求吧！</p>
<p>我是一個十七歲未成年的女孩子，曾讀完初中學程，父親在戰前也是正當的商人，家庭經濟環境還不十分差，戰後避難來滬，父親始終沒有正當職業，做做投機生意，竟多了一些錢，於是家裏的排塲頓時闊起來，父親母親的生活也非常奢侈，父親更與一班上等白相人做朋友，因此思想也受極大的影響。最近投機失敗，經濟不免稍受打擊，竟異想天開地强迫我去做舞女，想靠我發財，這種利令智昏，天性泯滅的舉止，眞叫我欲哭無淚。我爲自身前途幸福計，已婉辭拒絕，藉故延宕。奈父親一意孤行，不顧一切，聞已與某舞塲大班談妥，看來逼上火山之日，當不在遠。我有戀人某君，忠誠樸實，年少英俊，現服務滬上某銀行，收入尙佳。我父親母親最初也頗器重他。現在則因另有用心，已不准我與他見面。前天我想盡方法，與他晤談一次，把這不幸的消息吿訴他。他初則驚駭，繼則流淚。我知道他很願意帮助我，但是爲了種種顧忌（最大原因是我未成年），想不到一個妥善的辦法。我現在覺得父親的行爲已毫無父女情份，我何必更盡愚孝，任他宰割，犧牲我光明的前途？我現在決定於必要時，脫離家庭，隻身出走。茲有疑問數點，敬請指敎：</p>
<p>（一）父親强迫女兒操賤業，我可吾請律師交涉，與家庭正式脫離關係？</p>
<p>（二）我出走後，父親一定要疑心是我朋友的主張，也許會去與他交涉，但無證據，想不致有罪？</p>
<p>（三）上海救濟婦女的慈善機關有幾個？我想危急時投到那裏去，請求救濟，可吾？（請將地點賜知。）</p>
<p>上列各點，請於日內在自由談賜答，感恩不盡。</p>
<p>敬祝</p>
<p>撰安！　一個弱女子雯上七，十五。</p>
<p>我們接到上面這封信以後，眞是無話可說。上海這種地方，像雯女士這樣苦命，甚至比雯女士百倍苦命的女子，不知有多多少少。在一班父母的眼中，子女簡直是他們個人的私產，是一隻會生金蛋的白鵝，養着要發財的。祇要有利可圖，連子女的肉體靈魂，都可一概出賣。這種人不但可憐，而且可惡！</p>
<p>在這個時候無條件地痛恨這種父母，當然也不是辦法。根本上他們所受的敎育，就是一個問題，社會環境對他們當然也有很大的影響。一個人不能與惡劣的社會環境堅苦奮鬬，不能堅貞不拔地過一種物質上的淸苦生活，也可說是敎育的失敗。（我所說的敎育包括家庭敎育，學校敎育，社會敎育和自我敎育。）</p>
<p>根本上講來，這當然是一個社會問題，可是在整個社會的改造尙未完成之前，我們對於有志向上，肯爲光明而努力的女子，這是應該盡力予以援手，不可讓她們墮入火坑的。</p>
<p>像雯女士這種境遇中的女子，爲自衛起見，我們以爲應該力謀生活上與經濟上的自立，以免在脫離家庭的時候，受到顚沛流離，無家可歸的痛苦。關於對抗家庭的壓迫一點，我們希望雯女士立卽到江西路二〇九號工部局工業科所附設的兒童保障股，去看負責的小姐。我們已經跟她們接洽過，她們對於不甘墮落的被壓迫的弱女子，是十分關心，同情，而願意盡力帮忙的。其餘各點，恕不一一答覆了。</p>
<p>小品</p>
<h3>墨水</h3>
<p>— 舒文</p>
<p>怔望着乾涸了的墨水瓶，彷彿自己的心血也隨而枯耗了。</p>
<p>我感到一陣空虛，無極而低沉的湧上心頭。</p>
<p>一個月前，懷着巨大的歡喜買回一瓶派克墨水，那時侯剛開始一個寫作計劃，一切都是愉快而充滿生氣，那一瓶滿滿的藍墨水，是怎樣的矯盈晶滑啊，它象徵着一個富有新鮮活力的健康靑年，會動，會跳，豪勃不可一世，瞅住它，一個人就無端的與奮起來了，我撫摩而又撫摩，喜愛的放入紙盒內，以後就一直依賴它在一、張張稿紙上寫着，塗着，它順着金筆尖下來服從我的意志，左一扭，右一撇，漸漸和我的心血凝和在一起了，當我寫至深夜眼花時，常恍惚藍色字跡在燦爛的閃放桃紅色光芒，這光芒是我所熟悉的，它是我的心血的象徵，是我的精靈所苦思凝聚起來的。啊！我是怎樣的高興啊！撫摩着一個個藍字，一如浮彫似的堅實，硬朗，而逐漸增厚的原稿更令人深慰微笑了。我看一眼墨水瓶，感謝它，知道它永遠是滿滿的，永遠是朝氣勃勃與心血凝聚一起，來印下一個個淸晰的字跡的。</p>
<p>三個月，我的日子就這樣愉快的打發開了。</p>
<p>我的神經愈益緊張，工作愈覺綿延夜深，墨水就更加助我將一張張稿紙回抽屜裏送，由一百頁，而二百頁，而三百頁。啊，我的心要輕快的飛上天了。我不再怕熱，不再顧慮疲倦，徒覺自己蘊蓄的精力像墨水似的充沛豐裕，起勁的將墨水向紙上送……。</p>
<p>然而當我寫完了最後一個字時，墨水乾了，墨水用盡了。</p>
<p>我空虛，像三個月來緊張的精力一旦鬆弛枯耗一般，我軟弱得不能動彈了，我的心一直望下沉，當中留一塊無邊的曠野。</p>
<p>撫摩着二十萬字的原稿，我欲喜又悲的哀吊着空空的墨水瓶，和用盡在這幾百頁原稿上的可愛的墨水。</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第三章　對立的情報</p>
<p>霍桑點點頭道：「對，這推想很有意思—唉，你說上禮拜天夜裏也去看過戲。那時候你回家時的情形怎麼樣？」</p>
<p>老毛道：「那可和昨夜的情形大不相同。那天戲散塲時已經半夜後一點鐘。我回到這裏時，樓上樓下都已沒有燈光，大鬥也已鎖上。我開門進來，回房去睡。一些沒有異樣。」</p>
<p>霍桑丟了烟尾，又道：「好，昨夜裏你進了大門，就回你的門房裏去，不曾到這客室裏來過嗎？」</p>
<p>老毛道：沒有—先生，你總也明白，我不便進來啊。」</p>
<p>「那末，回房以後，你又怎樣？」</p>
<p>「我已吿訴你了啊。我吃了一些萬金油，喝了一杯冷茶，馬上就睡，一睡下去就睡着了。」</p>
<p>「這樣說，那個客人什麼時候去的，你也不知道嗎？」</p>
<p>「當真不知，我睡着以後，真到那槍聲發動，才被驚醒。等到我穿好衣服皮鞋走出來時，瞧瞧大門，依舊虛掩着沒有下鎖。那時李老爺跟金梅也已下樓，我聽得李老爺在客室中亂叫：『誰打死伊的？誰打死伊的？』我才知道王小姐已出了毛病。我走上石階，看見正門開着。我把門口的電燈開亮了，發見門口裏面的地板上，有幾個奇怪的脚印，我就喊起來，李老爺跟金梅也出來了。」</p>
<p>「那時你就用木板將足印蓋起來嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的，因為我旣然知道半夜裏有一個奇怪的客人，天又下着雨，這地板上的足印，當然很有關係，就回到房裏，抽了幾塊鋪板，蓋在足印上面，才走進來。」</p>
<p>霍桑點點頭。這點頭的動作彷彿有傳染性，影響到了倪探長。我記得倪金壽剛才聽金梅報吿時，曾懷疑老毛何以特別重視這個足印，現在聽了他的解釋，分明也認爲合理，故而不期然而然地點點頭。</p>
<p>霍桑又問道：「你說下去。以後又有什麼動作？」</p>
<p>老毛道：「我們商量了一回，金梅主張打電話報吿陸經理跟姜小姐。因為姜小姐是王小姐最好的朋友，常在這裏出進，昨天下午也來過的。當金梅打電話的時候，我曾陪李老爺到二層樓上王小姐的房間裏去瞧過一瞧，一些沒有異樣，伊的牀上的被褥鋪得整整的，沒有睡過，好像王小姐回來以後，不曾上樓去過。」　（五三）</p>
<h3>墓誌銘</h3>
<p>— 歐麗</p>
<p>我母親的墓碑上刻着：「她　人生，好像在吃津津有味的水菜一樣。』</p>
<p>—D.C.Peattie</p>
<p>隨筆</p>
<h3>生死和惡魔</h3>
<p>— 周戊</p>
<p>生和死怎樣區別？</p>
<p>醫生說：在人們能够繼續呼吸着的時候，是具有生命的；當呼吸一旦停止，便算死了</p>
<p>但是我現在所將說的生和死，與醫生所說的不同。倘若一個人活在世界上，活得毫無意義，對人類社會無些微帮助，無些微益處，那末與死又有何分別呢？進而說，社會因有了他而反多了一重負擔，他還是社會的累贅，倒不如死了的好。</p>
<p>有一句話是大家所熟知的：『死有重於泰山，有輕於鴻毛。』實在，在『生』亦如此。所以，我為『生』和『死』下了這肅的定義：</p>
<p>凡活着而對人類社會有貢獻有益處的，能稱為『生』。</p>
<p>凡活得毫無意義而對人類社會毫無禆益的，和呼吸停止的同，都叫『死』。</p>
<p>活着而有害人類社會的，旣不是『生』，亦不是『死』，無以稱之，祇得稱之爲『惡魔』。</p>
<h3>有天父沒有？　（二）</h3>
<p>其次，我們又當記得人類是有密切關聯而互相倚賴的；我們得着別人好處的幫助，有時也受到別人壞處的影響。因爲人類是如此的休戚相關，於是「犧牲法則」就發生功用，換句話說：就是某人時常爲別人受苦，或某些人爲多數人受苦。就道些物質災禍而論，好像是說，有些人必得受苦，好叫多數人能以生存。我們也許不能明瞭這點，但是世界是依從這種計劃造成的，却是很明願的。而在我們人的這方面，不能說造世界還有別的或較好的方法。在這事上，我們的智力是不够的。</p>
<p>我們要了解這種事實，也許是不大容易的，但我們也當記得：在提高人類方面，「犧牲法則」正是一種「進步法則」。當這種天災發生的時候，人被弄死了，或受重大的損失，常能激起人類表現至高尚的性質—表現道德，這在平常環境裏，也許不會表現的。別入受苦，使人有英勇的行動，也感動人表示同情和慷慨的援助，這種種都是附有將人類提到較高尙水平線的作用。而且這些事，也給與人們的警吿，指示人們有盡力採取預防這種危險的必要。因有這些危險，就使住在火山和地震附近一帶的人們，在建築方面，要設法蓋造適合的房屋，能受得住這種震撼，或種檀樹木，或保護森林，一方面，能以阻止水災的突至，另一方面，也能幫助預防飢荒的時常發生。</p>
<p>根據這種立場來硏究這個問題，我們就見到：這些天災，雖使許多人喪命受苦，然而結果或許使全人類受益匪淺。因爲人們從經騐裏，對於了解和把握自然力方面，必獲得許多進步，能以控制天災的最大毀滅力，或至少學知它們發生的時間和季節，原因和方式，就能避免它們所致的最壞的後果。</p>
<p>據此看來，這世界上似乎有些人有時不得不爲多數人的利益而受苦受難，這是爲甚麼？我們不知道！不過，如果人類大槪是受益的，大槪有進步的括，我們就不該晚造人類的上帝是不善良的。反而應該仰仗他的智能，相信他有一種福利人類約計劃。至於在天災裏遭遇死亡的人們，雖屬不幸，但我們應當記得「死」並不是對於個人絕對的災難，因爲還有超過死亡的來生。（待二十五日再續）</p>

<p>㳺藝界</p>
<h3>德國的戰時娛樂　—畸形繁榮出乎意料</h3>
<p>— 小齊</p>
<p>德國自從發動戰爭以後，根據國社黨政策，在戰爭狀態之下，要首先把所有的娛樂事業，停頓下來；但是這個企圖，立刻發現錯誤，統制娛樂業計劃，因之改變，甚至舞塲也恢復了營業。</p>
<p>現在德國各大都市中，戲院電影院咖啡館夜總會以及大小舞廳，都已重新紛紛開業，且出乎意外的營業畸形發達，比戰前還要熱鬧；禮拜六夜各處無不容滿，紙醉金迷，歌舞婆娑，置身其間，誰也看不出德國是有着戰事。</p>
<p>戲院裏上演的戲劇，着重「藝術」方面，大半是含有古典意味的劇本，喜劇是難得上演一齣；可是小型舞塲，却還是恢復了戰前女性的裸體表演，沒有戲院那麼嚴肅。</p>
<p>電影方面，各影院全映德國自攝的新片，義國片和美國片，祗是偶然映演一二回而已。</p>
<p>夜總會及舞廳，釵光鬢影，嘉賓滿座，爲的是有錢的人手裏拿了錢沒有其他用處，遂假借德國軍事連戰皆捷的勝利喜訊，來大大的享樂一下；同時還有好許多靑年，在被徵服役之前，也要放浪形骸，作盡情的娛樂。</p>
<h3>南國影后　李綺年會見記</h3>
<p>— 敬文</p>
<p>轟傳多時，卽將來滬的南國影后李綺年女士，果然在二十一日下午五時，來到了上海。記者震於影后的盛名，當卽走訪李女士於臨時下榻處——金門飯店。</p>
<p>在一個陳設非常雅潔的房間裏，會見了慕名已久的李女士，一個瓜子臉兒，浮着兩個醉人的酒渦，雖帶了點風塵憔悴的神情，但一種雍容華貴的儀態，已足以證明，這南國的影后，的確是名下無虛了。</p>
<p>使我非常驚奇的，她會是那麼的儉樸，我的理想中她這决到上海來，服裝方面，一定是炫奇鬥艷，華貴非凡，想不到她却脂粉不施，一件藍布旗袍之外，別無飾物，但這種打扮，却更足以表現她的美點——　態萬方，這也許就是古人所稱頌美人的話，所謂「亂頭粗服，天然丰韵」吧。</p>
<p>更使我驚奇的，她的一口流利的國語，幾乎令我穎心她不是生長在南國的人，而是產於幽燕的女兒了。</p>
<p>看了李女士的面部輪廓，不禁使我回想起已經逝世的一代藝人——阮玲玉。李女士的面部特點，實在很與阮女士有神似之處，老實說一句，中國電影有史以來的女演員，洗練的演技能使我傾倒，也可以說能使整個的電影觀衆一致傾倒的，只有阮女士一個人。</p>
<p>現在阮女士旣然飲恨而終，撒手離開那千萬的觀衆。這洗練演技的承繼者，當然，我們不能不寄無窮的希望於李女士，同時更希望李女士能發揮而光大之，那末李女士此次上海之行，可謂不虛了。</p>
<p>努力吧！李女士！這洗練演技者的皇冕，這裏也期待着你呢。</p>
<p>又據海星社稱，李對上海之第一個印象，謂美麗固遜於香港，而偉大則過之。李體格殊健美，低顰淺笑，頗多誘惑性，與陳雲裳之嬌小玲瓏，則又是一種風味也。</p>
<h3>楊盛春之戰濮陽</h3>
<p>— 唯我</p>
<p>日前顧曲更新，壓軸楊盛春之「戰濮陽」，精彩百出，洵爲佳構，不可無記。</p>
<p>按「戰濮陽」一戲，爲富連成專有之武戲，此戲爲武生累工戲，極不易唱，武工之繁重，不亞於「八大錘，」且雖吃重開打，而極多身段，故又與「鎮澶州」有異曲回工之妙，非年少力壯者不宜唱，（呂布一角非扮相漂亮不可）非武工有相當根基者不能唱，年少力壯武工有根基，而無良好配角者，亦不可唱，蓋此戲之典韋，曹操，與主角呂布有密切關係，非搭配熟練，難有精彩也。</p>
<p>以前此戲以茹富蘭最稱拏手，當時的茹富蘭年紀輕，扮相帥，武工好，開打衝，具唱「戰濮陽」應有的一切條件，再加上他的下靶韓富信的典章，妙到秋毫，紅花綠葉，相得益彰，乃成妙奏。自茹富蘭後，此戲以葉盛蘭最能號召，但盛蘭出科後，限於環境，演此戲之機會甚少，於是楊盛春後來居上，演此戲之精彩，大有取茹富蘭而代之概。</p>
<p>綜觀盛春所演。可謂十全十美，能如此者，要亦盛春具有愚所說演此戲應有之種種條件。（一）盛春年少力壯，扮相瀟灑，恰合呂布身份，出塲時之亮相，頗有大將威風，眉目間現出英雄氣概，無絲毫脂粉氣，可貴也。（二）盛春武工根基好，身段功架煞是好看，有一下塲身段要戟執翎子，與塲面配合，恰合鼓點，末一塲之進塲抬腿大轉身，均見工夫。（三）開打緊湊，此點卽得力於配角好，韓盛信之典韋極老練，與盛春對打有天衣無縫之妙，此戲對打塲子最爲吃重，蓋典韋執雙戟，呂布執單戟，戟與戟打，極爲不易，盛信爲盛春之老搭擋，對打時打成一片，乾凈俐落，可謂美妙絕倫，夫晚近武生人才極少售品，頃觀盛春之藝術孟晋，實在餘子之上，設能自勉，此子前途有厚望焉。</p>
<h3>李香君的編製</h3>
<p>— 鄒嘯</p>
<p>昨晚到璇宮劇院看周貽白先生所編的「李香君」的演出，客滿加凳，盛況空前．</p>
<p>此劇以前曾有孔尚任的桃花扇傳奇，歐陽予倩的桃花扇平劇。若照原來傳奇改編，頭緒粉繁，必難處理。貽白只抉出十人左右的重要角色來登台，旣不太多，又不太少，做到了「省頭緒」的好處。</p>
<p>並且，結搆也極清楚：差不多完全以阮大鋮李香君侯朝宗這三個人的葛藤作爲戲劇的中心·第一幕寫阮命王將軍以珍飾贈侯李納交被拒，第二幕緊接着就寫王將軍回去報吿，阮因懷恨而召香君，加以凌辱。第三慕又寫阮指使王將軍迫香君嫁給田仰，不從，，頭撞窗流血，楊文驄爲繪桃花扇。第四幕又寫阮逼香君入宮演燕子箋，適値南京被淸兵攻破，香君逃出。第五幕就寫香君與朝宗的末决會面，朝宗已出山赴淸廷考試，香君一慟而絕·差不多從第一幕到第四幕，阮大鋮一直做着侯李的對頭。第五慕阮鬍子雖未出塲，也由柳敬亭點題，說他已降淸，路死於仙霞嶺，無人收屍。·使人看起來全神貫注，有一氣呵成之感·甚至前四幕出場過的人物，到第五幕都借柳敬亭之口說出他們和她們的結局·「都已有了交代」一語，不啻夫子自道。那末，「密針梭」這一點也做得很使人滿意了。</p>
<p>還有一種巧妙的方法，就是借畫來引入本題，比方第三幕中余澹心的詩，第五幕中吳梅村的字，都省力而且取巧·這方法好像是以前歷史話劇作者所不曾用過的。</p>
<p>作者是考據家，所以劇中各事，大部分俱合史實。他不把鄭妥娘和楊文驄作爲小丑，不過分誇張福王，不把阮大鋮作爲凈，（僅使其作丑，讓他自己說，會唱戲。）不把朝宗看作完節的人，這都是他謹慎的地方。並且因爲不掩飾侯朝宗短處的緣故，使得第五慕特別精采，成爲以前諸家未到之筆，尤其値得稱讚。</p>

<h3>One-Day and One-Night Bloody Battle by Chinese Troops: Complete Recapture of Zhenhai County Seat; Street Fighting Erupted in the City Yesterday Morning, Japanese Unable to Sustain and Retreat; Japanese Troops on Both Banks of the Yong River Have Been Completely Eliminated</h3>
<p>Jinhua: After days of siege by Chinese troops, Zhenhai City was captured at 3:00 AM today, and the Chinese Blue Sky White Sun flag once again flies over Zhenhai City, to the boundless joy and excitement of the people. (Dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<p>Jinhua: Chinese troops in the Zhenhai area launched a fierce attack on the Japanese troops who had advanced into the coastal and urban areas, engaging in bloody battles in places such as Qijiaoshan, Xiaogang, and Yinjiangnanshi. Japanese warships bombarded the Chinese with fierce artillery fire, but the Chinese troops advanced without retreat, with extremely high morale, pressing forward one after another, successively capturing all strongholds, further intensifying the pressure, driving the Japanese to the narrow coastal areas, and annihilating them in one fell swoop at 2:00 AM on the 22nd, thereby completely clearing the Japanese from the right bank of the Yong River. The Chinese army on the left bank also advanced bravely and rapidly, fiercely attacking Zhenhai County, charging and killing the enemy numerous times. Unable to sustain the pressure, the Japanese troops completely lost control of the county seat at 3:00 AM this morning. The Chinese troops, taking advantage of the victory, pursued and wiped out all remaining Japanese troops outside the city by about 5:00 AM. (Dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<p>This Dispatch: After the Japanese navy secretly landed on the 19th and invaded Zhenhai's west gate, the city and surrounding areas immediately fell. However, the number of Japanese troops was very small. After a large-scale counterattack by the Chinese army, aided by 30,000 Chinese reinforcements in a day and night of bloody battle, Zhenhai was finally entered at 6:00 AM yesterday (the 22nd), completely recovering the city and surrounding areas. More than one hundred Japanese troops within the city walls were also completely annihilated. Important strongholds surrounding Zhenhai, such as Ma'anshan and Guniuling, as well as various forts, have all been recovered. The fall of Zhenhai this time was actually due to the reinforcements failing to arrive on schedule, which allowed the Japanese troops to break in. Guo Qiwu, the organizer of the maintenance association, upon hearing the news of the Chinese army's counterattack, immediately changed clothes and secretly fled the city and surrounding areas, scattering in all directions. As a result, the one-day-old maintenance association established by this side immediately disintegrated and vanished. It is reported that Mr. Wu and others have secretly gone to Ningbo to make representations to the Party, government, and military organs. Upon hearing of the recovery of Zhenhai, all sectors of Ningbo in this city were enthusiastic, actively engaged in rescuing wounded soldiers and providing relief to Zhenhai refugees, and are currently actively raising funds to provide relief to Zhenhai compatriots. As for the measures taken by the wounded soldier rescue committee, a decision has also been made after a meeting. (Dazhong News Agency)</p>
<p>This Dispatch: The shipping industry received a telegram from Ningbo at 4:00 PM yesterday, stating, "Bloody battle in Zhenhai lasted all night. Street fighting in the city. Japanese troops unable to sustain, collapsed and retreated at 11:00 AM. Zhenhai County completely recovered." The report of the recovery of Zhenhai has been completely confirmed. (Daguang News Agency)</p>
<p>This Dispatch: Before the recovery of Zhenhai County, the blockade line was also controlled by the remaining Japanese troops, who released speedboats to break through the plum blossom barriers. A medium-sized Japanese warship rushed into the blockade line the day before, seemingly attempting to go up the river. Therefore, the Chinese troops have been closely monitoring it. As of last night, the Japanese warship that rushed into the blockade line had not moved. In a certain section of the Yong River, the Chinese river defense troops have built two new, very strong blockade lines. The Caisteng Wheel (weighing over 300 tons, costing 400,000), the Yongmin Wheel (weighing over 100 tons, costing about 600,000), and the Ningshao Sanbei Hongxing Gaodeng piers have all been moved to the river surface of the new blockade line and sunk to fortify the river defense. (Datong News Agency)</p>
<p>This Dispatch: According to inquiries from Ningbo groups in Shanghai, the situation report of the Zhenhai battle yesterday is as follows: (1) Important strongholds such as Qingzhizhen, Ma'anshan, Lintangjia, Guniuling, and Changtiaozui had already been captured by the Chinese army by noon yesterday. Yesterday afternoon, the Chinese army launched a fierce counterattack against the Japanese troops entrenched outside the west gate of Zhenhai at Lanpu Bridge. The Japanese troops retreated in disarray, and the Chinese army is pursuing them. Currently, the Japanese army's reinforcements have been cut off, and they are exhausted and unable to hold on. The vanguard of the Chinese army has approached Zhenhai County to within about three li. The Chinese and Japanese armies in the Zhenhai urban area and Jiangnan area are still holding their original positions, with no major changes. There are no traces of Japanese troops at Wanjia Bridge in the west of the city. (2) Eight Japanese warships were anchored outside the mouth of Zhenhai yesterday, and fourteen more were added today, totaling twenty-two. One of the Japanese warships broke into the blockade line, and the Chinese army is closely monitoring it. Our ×× new blockade line has been completed and is exceptionally strong. In addition, three Japanese warships have sailed from the Xiangshan Qiancang waters, and one Japanese warship is anchored at Hengshan, with no unusual movements. (3) At 5:40 AM this morning, the air defense sentry issued an emergency air raid alert. It is reported that three Japanese planes were discovered over Longshan. The sound of planes was heard in this city, but the planes' whereabouts were unknown. The alert was lifted at 7:04 AM. At 7:45 AM, the air defense monitoring post issued a second emergency air raid alert. Japanese planes passed over the city, dropping four bombs in Meixu. One bomb landed at Qiujing Elementary School, destroying one house. The other three bombs landed in wasteland, causing no damage. (4) At 6:03 PM this afternoon, the air defense monitoring post issued an emergency air raid alert. Two Japanese planes were discovered over Longshan. (Datong News Agency)</p>
<p>Report That Japanese Landed on Sandu Island Is Incorrect</p>
<p>This Dispatch: Since the Japanese side blockaded Zhejiang and Fujian on the 16th of this month, followed by Japanese troops attempting to land on the coast, according to a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 21st, the Japanese navy had landed on Sandu Island, fifty miles northeast of Fuzhou. According to inquiries from various sources, this is incorrect. (1) According to the Shanghai-Sandu telegraph of the Ministry of Transportation Waterline Telegraph Bureau on Edua Road, telegrams are being received and sent as usual, and the bureau has received information that the Japanese have not landed on Sandu, and all work is proceeding as usual. (2) According to the Fujian Fellow Association and Fuzhou merchants in Shanghai, Sandu is close to Fuzhou and is one of the northeastern gateways of Fuzhou. If there were any accident, Fuzhou would not fail to report it by telegram. Today, the association has received only ordinary commercial telegrams and no other news, indicating that the report of the Sandu landing is purely inaccurate. (Note: Sandu is a small island located northeast of Fuzhou and southeast of Ningde. There is a considerable amount of foreign property on the island. Since Sanduao was blockaded by Japanese warships in the second half of last year, water transportation between the island and other places has been interrupted. (Pingming News Agency)</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops Attack Longzhou Several Times: Japanese Suffer Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to news from Longzhou, Guangxi Province, on the Vietnamese border, as a result of several attacks by Chinese troops, the Japanese army has suffered heavy losses. Since occupying Longzhou, the Japanese have made no progress and have only trapped themselves. (Havas News Agency dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Rumor That Song Ziwen Will Be Appointed Minister of Economic Warfare</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: It is rumored here among the Chinese that Song Ziwen will soon be appointed as China's first Minister of Economic Warfare. It is said that Mr. Song's recent trip to the Americas was related to the organization of this ministry. (Reuters dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle Over Chongqing: Chinese Troops Shoot Down Two Japanese Planes; Over 120 Japanese Planes Attacked Chongqing in Four Waves; Only Dropped Bombs in the Suburbs, Escaping After Being Pursued by Chinese Troops</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Two Japanese planes flew over Chongqing for reconnaissance. In an air battle lasting ten minutes, both planes were shot down by Chinese planes. The two Japanese planes were clearly intending to take photos of Chongqing in order to bomb it according to the map next time, but unexpectedly, they were both shot down by Chinese fighter planes waiting to intercept them. In the past week, the weather has been overcast and rainy, so there have been no Japanese planes over Chongqing, and it has been very quiet. After the two reconnaissance planes were shot down, the air defense headquarters received a report that eighty or ninety Japanese bombers had left Hankou, attempting to retaliate. Therefore, an air raid alert was issued here, and Chinese fighter planes also took off to circle and intercept the attackers. However, no Japanese planes were sighted until 3:30 PM, and the alert was lifted at that time. Although it was reported that Japanese planes had bombed nearby small towns, they did not penetrate into the Chongqing area. (United Press dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing: This afternoon, a hundred Japanese bombers attacked cities north and south of Chongqing in four waves. Although the Japanese planes did not reach the airspace over Chongqing City, residents took shelter in air raid shelters for nearly three hours. The first wave of Japanese planes bombed the Hechuan River (transliteration) north of Chongqing on the Jialing River. The second and third waves of Japanese planes circled over Beipei Hot Springs, which is also located on the Jialing River north of Chongqing, about halfway between Hechuan and Chongqing. However, it is reported that the Japanese planes did not drop bombs in the hot spring area. The fourth wave of Japanese planes, mostly coming from the same direction as the second and third waves, bombed the Jiangnan Sichuan Highway and cities south of Chongqing. Chinese fighter planes patrolled the airspace over Chongqing, waiting for the enemy planes, but they never arrived. It is reported that the Chongqing area issued an alert at 12:30 PM and lifted it at 3:20 PM. Also, this morning, officials confirmed that a Chinese fighter plane shot down a Japanese reconnaissance plane in a thrilling battle over Chongqing. It is also reported that another Japanese reconnaissance plane was also shot down. It is said that two Japanese planes were discovered circling over Chongqing City before 9:00 AM this morning, conducting reconnaissance. Five Chinese fighter planes immediately took off to intercept them. The Chinese planes dived to attack the Japanese, strafing them with machine guns. The people of Chongqing heard the sounds of machine guns and planes in the air and all ran to open spaces, watching the air battle. After several minutes, they saw two Japanese planes fall. It is reported that one of them crashed in the mountains on the western outskirts of Chongqing. (Reuters dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Every time Japanese planes attack Chongqing, they use their high-speed reconnaissance planes to conduct reconnaissance of the route in advance. Except for one that was shot down by the Chinese on June 12, the others have all slipped through the net. At 9:00 AM on the 22nd, a Japanese reconnaissance plane flew into the city airspace again, using its usual tricks. The Chinese Air Force was prepared and used two of the latest fighter planes to attack fiercely from behind. After only a few shots, the Japanese plane caught fire and crashed in Pengjia Garden. The citizens witnessed this and were all delighted. The reporter went to inspect and met Chief He, Commander Mao, and Director Zhang Zhizhong, who were returning from a visit, their expressions full of joy. Villagers along the way competed to visit, causing traffic to be blocked. The front part of the Japanese plane was shattered everywhere, and the rear part still had an empty shell. The nose of the plane crashed into a stream, and the wings were burned. The machine guns, radio, and camera in the plane have all been recovered. The plane body was marked with the Japanese type "98", and the tail had the numbers "861-3". The pilots were Captain Kato and Lieutenant Kuwahara, their bodies mangled and incomplete. At that time, villagers and soldiers competed to bury the Japanese corpses and carry the wreckage of the plane. At about 1:00 PM, more than 120 Japanese bombers attacked the capital in four waves. They flew close to the suburbs, but because their reconnaissance plane had been shot down by the Chinese and they had lost their eyes and ears, and because the weather was overcast and rainy and the Chinese were well prepared, they never dared to fly in and dropped bombs in the suburbs before escaping. (Dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing: More than 120 Japanese planes, at around 2:00 PM on the 22nd, attempted to attack the capital but failed, and flew to Hechuan, Qijiang and other places to drop bombs, escaping eastward. Dozens of bombs landed in Qijiang, causing three fires, which were immediately extinguished. More than ten people were killed or injured, and the rest landed in the wilderness. The situation of the bombing in Hechuan is still under investigation. (Dispatch of the 22nd)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Far Eastern Policy in the American Political Season</h3>
<p>Now that the incumbent U.S. President Roosevelt has accepted the nomination for a third term as president, how should the U.S. government and people continue to advance their firm international anti-aggression policy during the period from now until the election? This newspaper commented yesterday, summarizing what we hope for. Today, please elaborate on the inevitable trends thereafter.</p>
<p>Washington dispatches from the U.S. system yesterday and today: One said that this year's Congress has no intention of urging the United States to adopt a new policy in the Far East; another said that they do not believe that Congress will take any clear steps to deal with Japan; and another said that observers are now paying attention to what extent President Roosevelt will be bound by the Democratic Party's isolated foreign policy: and another said that before President Roosevelt defeats his political opponents in the election, all policies will probably take a stable and moderate path. All of this is said to be a certain percentage of the news, revealing the content of the U.S. political situation; the remaining percentage is of the nature of discussion, explaining the impact of the U.S. political situation. The size of the percentage occupied by the two types of nature. No one can tell. However, with the development of the American spirit of democracy, the political strategies of the two parties before the American election, and the historical precedents shown in American political history, anyone has no doubt that the above news and discussions are extremely pertinent. We also believe that in a politically enlightened country like the United States, where people are political animals, these are political issues, and the current period is a political season, so this half-news and half-discussion will bring the political atmosphere to the fullest. Fundamentally, a political human society cannot fundamentally eliminate the political atmosphere to the point of achieving a trans-political bright period with any majority belief, sound reason, or special fact. This is not only the case in the United States, but also in any democratic country. Even in countries controlled by extremely narrow-minded nationalists, no matter how much their rulers subjectively yearn for trans-politics, they are in fact inevitably like this. Generally speaking, the people who are most politically conscious are most easily confused, but they should not be too confused, and they must know that the political atmosphere is not the deciding factor of everything for a nation. If everything is determined by the nation and the choices are inseparable from the political atmosphere, if the observations or discussions of everything about the nation are based only on the political atmosphere, then it is only a politician, a strategist, or a polemicist. If this is the case, it is an omen of the nation's decline and a seed cause of the destruction of the democratic political system.</p>
<p>Specifically, regarding the current United States: although the most important political season that comes once every four years is approaching due to the presidential election, although international policy has become a political issue because it has become a tool of political struggle; however, there are some serious matters, especially those related to the Far East, that have either actually reached a fork in the road where the United States must make timely decisions; or are evolving rapidly, pushing to the point where the United States will obviously have to declare a clear attitude in a timely manner before the election in November; or more possibly, what unexpected and serious new disturbances will arise, requiring the United States to be prepared to deal with them immediately; For all three types of matters, we do not believe that the wise U.S. government and people cannot restrain their political atmosphere to the lowest limit, and allow whatever international policy issues are placed before them in the next three months to remain in the realm of domestic political issues due to the political season. Let's make a few hypothetical examples that are not impossible: Suppose that after the completion of the Konoe Cabinet in Japan, as has been widely rumored by the Japanese side and rumored by other countries, it brazenly invaded the scope of what the United States absolutely cannot tolerate in terms of its Far Eastern policy or Pacific security in terms of diplomacy or other practical actions; Suppose that incidents like the insults suffered by the New York Times Far East correspondent Abong, which are more serious and magnified, continue to occur and escalate; Suppose that Britain, again citing the weakness of the United States' attitude and actions in the Far East, prepares to take some retreating action in a last resort posture that despises treaty obligations and sacrifices the interests of the United States and other countries. No one dares to guarantee that these assumptions will never come true; Moreover, with the international situation becoming increasingly turbulent in recent years, and moving further and further away from common sense, reason, and morality, even the sudden outbreak of countless events that are more distant and keenly felt should not be considered unexpected or dismissed as groundless fears. Therefore, in the American political season, before the general election, it cannot be asserted that the U.S. authorities' dealings with the international community will necessarily become negative.</p>
<p>Moreover, from the perspective of the political strategy of political struggle, the Democratic and Republican parties in the United States are opposed to each other in the government and the public. However, the international policies declared to the people before the election only differ in tone and degree, and there is no divergence in action; Therefore, although international policy has unfortunately fallen into the realm of domestic political issues, the two parties have taken it as a tool of political struggle, and it is very likely that they will strive to compete under the common principles of anti-aggression and non-compromise, and finally reach a saturation point where the will and strength of the two parties in the country merge into one. It is precisely the political season, and in front of the crowds, the brilliance of justice and the flames of national honor can make those who appear to be stable and moderate and passive unable to argue and have nowhere to stand. In the near future, the Japanese Konoe Cabinet will inevitably stimulate the United States, at least for its inherent political reasons; yesterday's New York dispatch stated that although the Roosevelt government wants to avoid disputes with foreign countries before the election, the anti-American incidents that have occurred in the Far East in recent days will make moderation shameful for the general public; With various subtle causes lurking, there is absolutely no reason to assert that the United States' policy toward the Far East will be temporarily stagnant in negativity, that is, it is not difficult to discern its direction.</p>
<h3>U.S. Congress Reopens to Discuss National Defense Bill; Ban on Scrap Iron Shipments to Japan Must Be Implemented; Used to Counter Blockade of Yunnan-Burma Road</h3>
<p>Washington: The U.S. Congress has reconvened today and begun to discuss the $48 billion national defense bill, and is preparing to debate the compulsory military training bill. Political circles believe that Congress will continue to meet in the summer to conclude various outstanding cases, and there is no hope of adjournment in the near future. Democrats advocate that Congress should continue to meet until September 1, while Republicans insist that Congress should meet continuously during the European war, regardless of how long it lasts. Secretary of the Navy Knox and Chief of Naval Operations Stark will request the House Appropriations Committee to approve funds to begin building a navy that exceeds the fleets of all the great powers. Also, the Senate Army Committee has completed the review of the compulsory military training bill of Burke Waterworth, and the final draft of the bill can be prepared within this week. The Senate Army Committee may also approve the summoning of the National Guard, so that President Roosevelt can summon the National Guard. Well-informed sources said that President Roosevelt may enlist 50,000 people for training after the Senate passes it. (United Press dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<p>Washington: Diplomatic circles now believe that the United States may discuss banning scrap iron shipments to Japan to counter Japan's blockade of the Yunnan-Burma Road. This belief in diplomatic circles is based on the following two facts: (1) Secretary of State Hull's opposition to the blockade of the Yunnan-Burma Road; (2) Colonel Stimson's appointment as Secretary of War; (3) The recent authorization by Congress for President Roosevelt to control the export of major national defense raw materials, and scrap iron must be included in the list of banned items. Several powerful individuals and private groups in the United States have long advocated banning scrap iron shipments to Japan, but the State Department has been slow to implement it because there is no legal basis for this action. Well-informed sources said that Colonel Stimson has repeatedly advocated banning the shipment of weapons, ammunition, and all military raw materials to Japan. In January, he even publicly wrote a letter to the New York Times, urging the United States to take this action. (United Press dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<h3>If the U.S. is Directly Threatened, It Will Immediately Send Troops to Participate in the War: A Senator's Remarks</h3>
<p>Washington - Senator Thomas, a Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recently told a United Press reporter that he believes the Democratic foreign policy will allow U.S. troops to be sent outside the Western Hemisphere if the Philippines, Hawaii, or any place in the Western Hemisphere is attacked. Thomas also stated that the Democratic platform stipulated that the U.S. would never participate in foreign wars unless attacked, and would not send naval, land, or air forces to foreign lands outside the Americas. However, this platform has already left room for the U.S. to participate in foreign wars. If aggression in any place is sufficient to threaten the U.S., the U.S. will certainly participate in the wars in Europe or the Far East. For example, an attack on the Philippines or Hawaii can be considered an attack on the U.S. The same interpretation can be applied to attacks on islands in the Western Hemisphere or any American people. It would be extremely foolish to draw boundaries to tell the enemy that the U.S. will only attack when the enemy invades these boundaries. If the U.S. allows a certain enemy country to acquire military bases in the Western Hemisphere by conquering an island or controlling Latin American countries, wouldn't that give the enemy the benefit of free action? Once attacked in the Western Hemisphere, the U.S. will immediately send troops to fight, and there is no doubt about that, he said. (United Press Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Pan-American Conference Will Discuss Territorial and Economic Issues: First Meeting Held Yesterday, Hull Delivered a Speech; Cuban President Urges Preparation for Self-Defense</h3>
<p>Havana - The Pan-American Conference opened here yesterday to consider all economic, military, and territorial issues affecting the Western Hemisphere due to the European war. Cuban President Bru delivered an opening speech, stating that the American countries "must take it upon themselves as the sacred task of guardians of a civilization that has not yet been sold out." He urged the American countries to quickly prepare all "active self-defense work." This speech is the outline of this conference, expressing without reservation the principles of democracy, peaceful laws, and service to others, calling it the motivation in American history. The representatives of the participating countries will listen to the speech of U.S. Secretary of State Hull at the first plenary session today. It is strongly implied here that before the territories and activities of France and the Netherlands in the Western Hemisphere are discussed and resolved, the U.S. representatives may try to delay the consideration of economic proposals. In today's meeting, a conference-wide committee may be organized first, and then subcommittees will be appointed to discuss all issues of neutrality, self-defense, peace, and economic cooperation. (United Press Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Havana - U.S. Secretary of State Hull has already had a conversation with the representatives of the participating countries yesterday. It is reported that he has learned that all representatives recognize the necessity for the American countries to take joint action to determine the future fate of the West Indian territories. It is heard that Hull will express the U.S.'s attitude towards the West Indies in his speech and will announce methods to deal with sabotage activities in the Western Hemisphere. (United Press Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Havana - Cuban President Bru, in his address at the opening of the Pan-American Conference, called for unified solidarity between the two continents. He stated, "The countries of the Western Hemisphere must prepare to actively protect common rights." During the first meeting, the representatives of various countries and U.S. Secretary of State Hull sat solemnly in the tall building with a magnificent dome. However, when the German representative arrived, a tense atmosphere immediately arose. Tense behind-the-scenes diplomatic activities were already underway, as those who had the most at stake in the conference were striving to resist the potential for the German side to obstruct the progress of the conference. The representatives of various countries are now eagerly awaiting Secretary of State Hull's speech this afternoon, as he may clarify U.S. policy and plans for the conference at that time. It is rumored that Hull may announce a surprising plan in the next few days, in which he may cede economic rights to other republics in exchange for their cooperation in resisting the military and economic intrusion of totalitarian countries. Currently, all Latin American republics except Argentina are able to cooperate with the U.S., but it is heard that the Brazilian representative is now working hard to get Argentina to join this group. Currently, all parties' interests are focused on President Roosevelt's proposal to organize a Pan-American economic alliance, which is expected to be discussed at this conference. The former German minister to Chile, Mr. Lissner, is now leading the German delegation to work against the conference. They intend to persuade the American representatives, saying that Germany is bound to win, and therefore it is unwise for them to adopt business plans that are unfavorable to Germany. The Cuban secret police are now closely monitoring the 40,000 Spanish Fascists in Cuba who are cooperating with the German side. (International News Service Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>New York - The Pan-American Conference opened in Havana, the capital of Cuba, yesterday, with representatives from the 21 republics of the Americas in attendance. Yesterday's program consisted of the opening ceremony and a welcoming speech by the Cuban President. The conference will begin to handle business today, starting with speeches by U.S. Secretary of State Hull and the chief representatives of Cuba and Paraguay. This meeting was convened to consider various issues arising from the war situation. It is expected that the discussions will include a proposal for the 21 republics to establish a joint protection system for the territories in the Western Hemisphere belonging to European countries that have been invaded, and a plan proposed by the U.S. to organize a Pan-American group to deal with the surplus production of various American countries. Informal private discussions have already taken place among the representatives of the various countries, and it has been found that the conference faces several difficulties. According to a dispatch from the New York Times Havana correspondent, the delegations want to actively cooperate to maintain peace in the Western Hemisphere, but the gap between North America and South America still exists in terms of economic and political unity. The South American representatives are very willing to consider any proposal from the U.S. to solve the problem of losing markets due to the war, but there are doubts as to whether the U.S. plan is suitable for practical use. As for preserving peace in the Western Hemisphere, the conference will probably discuss how to deal with disruptive forces without involving military mutual assistance issues. According to a New York report, many Latin American countries believe that without miraculous and unpredictable political skills, no clear results can be produced. (Reuters Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>New Governor-General of Vietnam Sworn In, Vows to Eliminate Internal and External Crises and Defend Vietnam's Position</h3>
<p>Saigon - The newly appointed Governor-General of French Vietnam, Vice Admiral Decoux, was sworn in yesterday and delivered a speech, calling on the residents of Vietnam to abandon sectarianism and work together to revive France and Vietnam. His speech stated briefly: French compatriots and Vietnamese people, although the current situation is extremely difficult, I am taking office as Governor-General of Vietnam with full confidence. Except for fifty years, Vietnam has been ruled by naval officers at all other times, and the foundation for Vietnam was also laid by naval officers. I will naturally follow the legacy and continue to work hard, so that I can be worthy of the glorious cause of my predecessors. In addition, I also concurrently serve as the Commander-in-Chief of the French Fleet in the Far East and will naturally take it as my responsibility to safeguard France's position in the Far East. Our country has owned great colonies in Asia for nearly a hundred years, and this position has been proven by history and praised by various countries. From then on, I will cooperate with local government offices and military commanders to eliminate internal and external crises and defend Vietnam's position. I dare to ask you to put personal issues and party politics aside and focus on the revival of France and the future of Vietnam, and I wish you closer cooperation and more effective results. Furthermore, unity between superiors and subordinates is the foundation of the French nation's spirit of nation-building, and this spirit is especially necessary during this time of national crisis. French Vietnam is still able to maintain peace, maintain discipline, and work as usual for this reason. I am willing to encourage you all. (Havas Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>German Newspaper Comments on U.S. Gold Policy: Reorganization of European Economic Life; No Way Out for Gold in the Western Hemisphere</h3>
<p>Berlin - Yesterday, Dr. Wintschuh, the economic editor of the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, published an article entitled "Looking Back from the Year 2000" on the issues of post-war reparations and the world economy. He stated, "In the autumn of 1940, the U.S. owned 80% of the world's gold reserves. The U.S. has gained enormous benefits from the war, and this situation is exactly the same as after the World War. Americans believe that gold can give them control over new economic relations, but the development of the situation proves otherwise. Previously, the European currency system was based on gold, but because Germany defeated Britain, the pound sterling collapsed, and European economic life has been reorganized without using the gold standard, which is contrary to people's expectations. The victorious countries do not demand reparations in gold or refined goods as the countries of Versailles did. In the past, attempts to resist the clearing trade methods of totalitarian countries based on gold trade have failed. The current situation has changed because European banks refuse to buy gold, and the world economy is developing according to the principles of totalitarian countries. As a result, the remaining gold is transported to the U.S. As a result of the U.S. hoarding huge amounts of gold, all other countries in the world have no choice but to resist the U.S. economically. The U.S. woke up from its gold dream and found that it wanted to buy goods with gold, but no one needed gold. Although it used various methods to find gold buyers abroad, all failed. There is absolutely no way out for gold in the Western Hemisphere. South America asked the U.S. to sell its surplus products, but the U.S. was unable to do so. South America then resold to its old markets, still conducting a barter trade with Europe even after the outbreak of the war? Although Europe absorbed this trade, it also wanted to develop Africa as a source of raw materials. At this time, the U.S. reduced the purchase price of gold and finally completely stopped buying gold. However, this measure made the value of gold even lower. At this time, Washington planned to lend gold bonds to Europe, but they were all rejected. Finally, the U.S. planned to donate half of its gold to Europe and establish a gold standard currency system as a condition for world trade, but this gift was also rejected. At this point, the U.S. mint minted gold coins to arouse personal interest in gold, but this attempt also failed. No one wanted to carry heavy gold bars, and people still preferred to use bank notes and checks. No one wanted to pay with gold, only estimating the value according to the amount of goods that could be purchased with their deposits. Finally, the gold was melted and cast into gold utensils for the tables of U.S. ministers and ambassadors, as a commemoration of the past years. Wall Street was renamed Gold Street." This is the end of the gold flowing into the U.S. (Haitong Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>U.S. to Hold Large-Scale Army Maneuvers, with 300,000 Soldiers Participating, Unseen in 20 Years</h3>
<p>New York - The U.S. Army will hold large-scale maneuvers within the next week. It is heard that as many as 300,000 soldiers will participate. Such a large-scale exercise is the only one the U.S. has seen in 20 years. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>U.S. Political Interests in the Dutch East Indies are Greater Than Economic Interests</h3>
<p>Attleboro - According to a research report by the Pacific International Relations Research Institute, the U.S. relies more on the British Malayan Federation for material resources than on the Dutch East Indies. The U.S.'s economic interests in the Dutch East Indies are relatively light, while its political interests in that area are very significant. During his research on the various existing economic and political factors in Asia, Dr. Kier, an expert at the Pacific International Relations Research Institute, discovered that the U.S. would never sit idly by and watch any change in the situation that would put the supply of vast, inexpensive materials into the hands of the conqueror. The recent situation in Europe has not only resulted in the occupation of the Netherlands but has also put Britain at risk of being conquered. This situation has made the aforementioned U.S. attitude even clearer. Kier's report continued, judging from both Latin American rubber production and synthetic rubber production, the U.S.'s reliance on the Dutch East Indies is very slight, because the U.S. has now concluded an agreement with Brazil, which stipulates that the U.S. will assist Brazil in the mass production of various subtropical agricultural products needed by the U.S. These agricultural products include rubber, quinine, vegetable oil, and several types of hardwood. These items are all supplied by Asian countries to the U.S. In addition, Latin America has spent a great deal of effort in preventing diseases in rubber production and has largely overcome these difficulties. According to reliable sources, the production of this rubber can be greatly developed within five years to meet commercial needs. Regarding tin, although the tin mines in Bolivia and the Belgian Congo do not have sufficient output to meet world needs, they can also provide temporary relief in times of emergency. Therefore, regarding rubber and tin, the U.S. can still obtain supplies from the Americas in times of emergency. The report continued, the U.S.'s extraordinary concern for the fate of the Dutch East Indies is obviously not only in terms of investment and trade figures. In fact, putting forward the two ends of investment and trade figures is sufficient to prove that the U.S.'s economic interests in the Dutch East Indies are not very important. If we study the Dutch East Indies alone, the argument that the U.S. depends on the Dutch East Indies for military raw materials is also broken, because the rubber of the Dutch East Indies accounts for only 25% of what is consumed by the U.S., and tin accounts for only 5%. Even if the Dutch East Indies is occupied by other countries, it is still questionable whether the exports of the Archipelago, Malaya, Burma, Vietnam, and even most of Siam would be prevented, because producers are willing to sell their goods to good customers. If, due to political relations, the occupiers strive to prohibit the shipment of these exports, it is also questionable whether a complete blockade can be achieved, because convoys can still transport these prohibited goods to the U.S. If the Suez Canal and Gibraltar cannot be passed, they will detour around the Cape of Good Hope to reach the east coast of the U.S. Furthermore, viewed from the perspective of so-called major commodities, the goods imported by the Dutch East Indies are not as important as those imported by other Southeast Asian countries.

<h3>France Plans to Restore Economic Life, Still Centered on Paris</h3>
<p>London - French Minister of Transportation Pittet broadcast last night, revealing the extent of the damage suffered by France during the German invasion, saying that more than 700 railway bridges were destroyed, and roads, rivers, telephones, and telegraphs were all affected, resulting in obstructed communication, difficult food transportation, and a severe shortage of automobiles, coal, lubricants, and all materials. He called on the people of the country to help repair the damage. According to French radio station Toulouse, the French authorities have asked the boards of directors of private commercial firms, banks, stock exchanges, and insurance companies to return to Paris and have begun to plan the revival of French economic life. The moratorium on payments has now been suspended. Finance Minister Bouthillier will go to Paris today. The authorities have ordered to authorize Bouthillier to lend to commercial firms so that they can resume business. (Reuters Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Vichy - All French banks, exchanges, insurance companies, and economic enterprises directly or indirectly related to the government have received an order from French Finance Minister Bouthillier to immediately move back to Paris within this week. The circular states that Paris will once again become the economic center of France, and all government officials will also go to Paris so that all economic enterprises can contact the government. The Finance Minister will go to Paris today and will not go anywhere else. Marshal Pétain will authorize the Finance Minister to lend large sums of money to all commercial offices and semi-official enterprises that are unable to produce until the end of October this year, regardless of the provisions of the law.

<h3>Many French Officials to be Dismissed Soon</h3>
<p>Vichy - According to people close to Deputy Prime Minister Laval last night, the dismissal of a large number of administrative governors and deputy governors, as well as staff members of the administrative governor's office, is expected to occur at any time. Marshal Pétain will not allow any actions against the new government. Therefore, the French government has decided to order all these officials to be dismissed uniformly by the end of October this year. Before going to Paris, Interior Minister Marcel Déat submitted the list of administrative governors and deputy governors to Marshal Pétain. The list and the order will be published in the government gazette, which will be a sign of dismissal. (Haitong Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Remittances Difficult in Various Parts of France</h3>
<p>Vichy - According to the Petit Journal yesterday, the most difficult problem for the French postal service at present is the inability to mail money orders between the occupied and unoccupied areas of France. If a family's members are separated in two areas, they cannot remit money to help each other. The newspaper asked the Armistice Commission in Wiesbaden to discuss this matter immediately. In view of the friendly attitude of the German military authorities, it is expected that no difficulties will arise. (Haitong Dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>Tokyo – The newly appointed Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka of the Konoe Cabinet, when addressing the press, stated that governance does not require excessive talk, and he will substitute actions for words, refraining from verbose discussions. He believes that most diplomats or politicians who engage in lengthy speeches often fabricate lies or intend to create empty threats. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>Tokyo –健治 Tomita Kenji, the governor of Nagano Prefecture, has been internally designated as the chief cabinet secretary for the Japanese Cabinet; Kazue Kobayashi, the Minister of Commerce and Industry, and Tadatsugu Ishiguro, the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, will arrive in Tokyo tomorrow or the day after. Konoe plans to hold a ceremony for the appointment of cabinet members on the 22nd, and present the list of cabinet members to the Imperial Palace at the end of the month, where the Emperor will hold the appointment ceremony. (22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The military organ newspaper "国民新聞" (Kokumin Shimbun) recently published an editorial warning about the diplomatic policies that the Konoe Cabinet might pursue. It stated: "If the power of Britain and France in the Far East is eliminated, it would be unwise for us to allow the powers of Germany and Italy to replace them. Japan's diplomatic policy should not be solely aimed at flattering Germany and Italy but should deal with each country on an equal footing. Moreover, the outcome of the war between Britain and Germany is uncertain, and the manner in which Germany will compete with the Soviet Union in diplomacy is also unknown. If Japan only follows the lead of Germany and Italy's policies toward the Soviet Union, it would be detrimental to its own ideals and mission. Furthermore, Japanese newspaper correspondents stationed in Berlin have reported that although various circles in Germany have expressed welcome at the beginning of the Konoe Cabinet, if the policies implemented by the Konoe Cabinet disappoint the Germans in the future, it may cause different reactions, which cannot be predicted.</p>
<p>日日新聞 (Nichinichi Shimbun) reported that certain German sources have issued a warning, stating that if Japan's attitude remains hesitant, it will lose the friendship of Germany and Italy, and Japan will be isolated and helpless." (Havas, 21st)</p>
<h3>Davis Announces New American Invention; Can Mix Rubber and Steel; Create New Decking for Aircraft and Warships</h3>
<p>Detroit, USA – Davis, the chairman of the American Rubber Company, recently announced that the decks of aircraft, warships, and tanks, traditionally made of pure steel, can now be made from a new type of decking that combines rubber and steel. After three years of trials, the company has successfully mixed rubber and steel to create a material that is stronger than pure steel and weighs 10% less. This invention is vital to the future of American rearmament because it reduces the weight of aircraft, warships, and tanks, allowing for increased military equipment. If the military equipment is not increased, the speed of aircraft, warships, and tanks can be improved. The construction of the new decking cannot be disclosed at this time. However, according to tests at the factory, the decking can withstand any caliber of cannon fire from close range to 200 yards. (Havas, 21st)</p>

<h3>Hitler Awaits Churchill's Reply; Pope Seeks Armistice Between Britain, Germany, and Italy; Britain to Reject All Mediation</h3>
<p>Berlin – Germany remained still yesterday, awaiting Britain's response to Führer Hitler's appeal and postponing the blitz attack on the British Isles. A senior German official warned the British, "Do not think that by not responding to Führer Hitler's speech, you can prolong the time of the German offensive. Hitler will only wait for a time he deems appropriate, not a day longer." Officials here do not acknowledge the reaction to Hitler's speech broadcast by the British newspapers and radio stations as Britain's rejection of Führer Hitler's "peace proposal." German sources indicate that British Prime Minister Churchill will address the British House of Commons tomorrow, and Germany hopes that Churchill will use this opportunity to respond to Hitler's speech. Neutral observers believe that Führer Hitler may postpone the attack on Britain until after Churchill delivers his speech. If Churchill formally rejects Hitler's speech, Germany will take swift action. (United Press, 22nd)</p>

There are conflicting reports about whether the Pope will meet with the German and British ambassadors. (International, 22nd)</p>
<p>The Times of London on the Future of the War</p>
<p>London – The diplomatic correspondent of The Times predicted that Foreign Secretary Halifax's speech tonight would be in response to Hitler's speech. The Foreign Secretary's speech will reject all mediation, as today's struggle is between a free society and a concentration camp, between Christian hope and openly glorifying heresy, which does not allow for any mediation. Therefore, his remarks will be less about military reasons and more about significant moral arguments. A month before Hitler's speech, when France was in its worst condition, Britain had already given a clear response on June 18. On that day, Prime Minister Churchill explained the unwavering determination of Britain to continue the war, based on solid reasons. Churchill said, "The joint admonition of the specialized advisors of the two military branches advised us to continue the war, and Britain has a good and reasonable hope of ultimate victory." When the three military branches issued this opinion, many things were uncertain. Could the British regiments return from France? Could they and other regiments be quickly re-equipped? Would the German offensive erupt as early as Berlin predicted? All of these were uncertain. Afterwards, these questions were answered in favor of Britain. The solid work that has been implemented for national defense and the Royal Air Force in recent months has shown its effectiveness in the recent widespread air raids. Now Britain can not only defend itself but also launch attacks. Hitler probably hesitated and waited until he recognized that his preparations were complete before launching an attack. However, the delay in Hitler's attack on Britain is not only beneficial to the German army. The calm and confident opinion of the British military leaders a month ago has no reason to change, nor is there any trend toward any change. Germany's resources are neither as abundant as Hitler said nor as scarce as many people imagine. When the war broke out, Germany's reserves were abundant, and it has also gained greatly during the war. Its conquest of France has secured enough rubber supply to last for many months, and the iron needed by German industry can now be obtained entirely from France, Norway, and Sweden. Germany has a large reserve of gasoline, and the output of gasoline extracted from brown coal is also gradually increasing, but Germany's total gasoline supply is still insufficient to meet its wartime needs. Furthermore, Germany lacks many ferrous alloys and tin, and will soon feel the shortage of copper. The food situation is now even worse. Other items such as cotton, hemp, and wool are now scarce. The correspondent concluded, "The various news reaching London can be summarized as follows: Germany's war machine is currently being expanded at an enormous cost, which is unbearable for the civilians." The Times also published an editorial stating, "Hitler's speech may be a prelude to a long-term postponement of the attack on Britain. Hitler may settle for a war of attrition, but this seems unlikely. However, no matter which path Hitler takes, we are prepared to deal with it. The air offensive is now in the hands of our fighters and bombers, who will maintain this offensive, regardless of what counterattacks they encounter, while the German army prepares to invade us, and our sovereignty at sea remains unmatched." (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Italian Journalist Gayda Appeals to America</p>
<p>Rome – Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gayda, yesterday appealed to President Roosevelt and the United States, asking them to have a fuller understanding of the events and intentions of Germany and Italy. Gayda wrote in "The Voice of Italy" that President Roosevelt's prejudice against the Italo-German axis has prevented him from seeing the truth of the European events. Gayda questioned why the President can do everything possible to help the people of other countries but does not pay attention to the needs of 130 million Italian and German people. He said, "We have no dispute with President Roosevelt, we only believe that his remarks are the result of his hatred of Fascism and Nazism. We ask, what benefit does the United States have in continuing this kind of action that is not conducive to the progress of civilizations in history?" Gayda also solemnly stated that both the Republican and Democratic parties in the United States have declared political programs intended to avoid involvement in the European war as much as possible. He said that "this trend will clarify the situation." Observers believe that Gayda indirectly advised President Roosevelt not to make empty promises to Britain, giving the mistaken hope that the United States might intervene in the European war, causing Britain to refuse to consider Hitler's recent peace proposals.

<p>Turkish Newspapers Criticize Hitler's Speech</p>
<p>Berlin – After Hitler delivered his speech, Turkish newspapers said that Hitler's speech was close to a request for peace. Only a few days after Churchill's speech, Hitler asked to be friendly with Britain, which was an exposure of weakness. German newspapers responded and said that the managers of the Turkish newspapers that published these remarks were receiving subsidies from Britain and were simple-minded, which led them to make this paradox. (Haitong, 22nd)</p>

According to Mr. Hill, the Consular Body's next steps in response to the request of the Chairman of the Municipal Council could not yet be announced. However, according to information obtained from other sources, the Consular Body will grant the Municipal Council special powers to implement special measures, including advancing the evening curfew and establishing various barriers to cut off traffic on small roads, etc. An official also announced yesterday morning that the Consular Body will also request the authorities of the defense forces of various countries stationed in Shanghai to jointly participate in the prevention and control work of the police authorities. It is reported that the authorities of the defense forces of various countries have decided to do their best to assist, so that their work can be more effective. The Consular Body was originally scheduled to hold a meeting yesterday afternoon, but the meeting was postponed because the Japanese Consul General, Mr. Miura Yoshiaki, claimed that he had received the notification too late and that he had another appointment yesterday afternoon that he could not attend, so the meeting was canceled. It is noted that the letter from the Chairman of the Municipal Council, Mr. Keswick, to the Consular Body was submitted to the Danish Consul General, Mr. Hill, on the evening of the 20th. After receiving the letter, Mr. Hill considered the matter to be extremely important and immediately notified the other consuls to convene a meeting, but the meeting was eventually postponed.</p>
<p>Japanese Spokesperson Offers Different Opinion</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy stated at a press conference last night that the Japanese authorities believe that the Shanghai Municipal Council Chairman Keswick's request to the senior Consul in Shanghai to convene a meeting of the Consular Body to study ways to curb political terrorism is procedurally incorrect. The spokesperson stated that, firstly, the letter should not have been made public before it had been read by the consuls of the countries involved. Secondly, the letter concerns the issue of maintaining peace and order in Shanghai. This issue should have been discussed with the directors of the Municipal Council before the letter was written and published. Thirdly, the Consular Body is the ruling organization of the Municipal Council, so the Municipal Council is a subordinate body of the Consular Body. Now that Mr. Keswick has asked the Consular Body to convene a meeting, although the Consular Body is willing to cooperate, this procedure is "upside down" and seems to be a case of "holding the handle of the sword upside down." The Japanese authorities agree to maintain law and order and suppress terrorism, but the fundamental issue is the cause of these terrorist acts. There are many causes, but the most important is that those responsible in Shanghai cannot cope with the various realities of the current situation. The spokesperson continued to say that the Chongqing government is no longer able to exercise its power in Shanghai, and that the real power is exercised by the Japanese authorities and the Nanjing "regime." Most terrorist acts are caused by a lack of recognition of this fact, such as the unresolved issue of the First Special District Court due to a lack of realistic understanding.</p>
<p>Planning Effective Suppression Measures</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was believed by well-informed sources that at the special meeting of the Consular Body to be convened on Thursday at the request of the Chairman of the Municipal Council, Mr. Keswick, various measures to curb terrorist activities will be approved. The main measures are to strengthen the curfew and to erect barriers between the International Settlement and the notorious badlands. The special meeting was originally scheduled to be convened yesterday, but was postponed to Thursday (the 25th) because the Japanese Consul General, Mr. Miura, claimed that the notification was too short and that he could not attend. A reporter inquired with the senior Consul, Mr. Hill, yesterday about everything. He said that he could not disclose the emergency measures that the Consular Body intends to discuss at the meeting on Thursday. However, according to another reliable source, the Consular Body may grant the Municipal Council special powers, including advancing the curfew time and adding barriers at the border between the International Settlement and the badlands, and that the foreign defense forces stationed in Shanghai will assist the Municipal Council so that the Municipal Council can implement work on a larger scale.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Investigates Assault on American Reporter</h3>
<p>A spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy stated at a press conference last night that the Japanese consular police are doing their best to investigate the two thugs who assaulted American reporter Mr. Abben in the Broadway Mansions. The spokesperson confirmed that the Japanese Consul General had received the protest raised by the American Consul General on July 20, but the reply has not yet been sent.</p>
<h3>Batch of Ashes of Japanese Soldiers to be Shipped Home Today</h3>
<p>Another batch of ashes of Japanese soldiers killed in action on the front lines recently arrived in Shanghai. The Japanese side held a memorial service at the Nishi Honganji Temple in Hongkou the day before yesterday. The ashes are scheduled to be shipped back to their country by ship at 5:00 PM today. This is the 44th time that Japan has shipped back to its country the ashes of soldiers killed in action in China.</p>
<h3>Hurricane Suddenly Changes Direction, Edge of Storm Touched Shanghai Yesterday, Customs House Raised Ball Warning Yesterday Afternoon, Shanghai Weather Disrupted by Wind</h3>
<p>The Pacific hurricane has begun to advance on Shanghai, and the city has been affected by the edge of the storm. The Jianghai Customs House has raised a black ball warning. According to the Xujiahui Observatory's report at 6:00 AM yesterday, the hurricane had advanced to 27 degrees north latitude and 123 degrees east longitude. The center of the storm was within 60 nautical miles, moving rapidly in a due north direction. According to the reported position, the hurricane had advanced to the sea southeast of Fuzhou, only 180 nautical miles away, and the storm was fierce.</p>
<p>It is also reported that although the Pacific hurricane has touched Shanghai, its main force passed through the waters east of the Zhoushan Islands, outside the Wusongkou, and has a tendency to move towards Qingdao and Yantai. It is expected that the hurricane will pass over Shanghai before 10:00 AM this morning.</p>
<p>Wind Direction Reverses</p>
<p>The Jianghai Customs House received a report from the Observatory in the afternoon, stating that the hurricane had now advanced to 28 and a half degrees north latitude and 123 and a half degrees east longitude. The wind direction changed from due north to north-northwest. The center of the storm was within 60 nautical miles, advancing towards the city, only 240 nautical miles from Shanghai. The Customs House then, at 2:30 PM yesterday (Customs House time),</p>
<p>Raised Ball Warning</p>
<p>Hoisted a black ball high on the flagpole on the roof of the clock tower, and placed a red light at night to warn ships on the Huangpu River to prevent hurricane attacks. Shipping in and out has been affected.</p>
<p>Ships Sheltering from the Wind</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Great Britain Company's "Pi Hai" vessel, the Taikoo Company's "Chao Bei," "Shandong," "New Beijing," and "Niuzhuang" vessels, which were scheduled to export, and the irregular ship "Mei Xing" vessel, which was scheduled to go to Qingdao, all suspended exports to wait for the hurricane to pass before raising anchor again. It is reported that the German firm Luhring's "Fei Yuan" vessel and the Italian firm Yi Hua's "Bao Li" vessel, which were scheduled to return to Shanghai from Wenzhou yesterday, had not been seen entering the port by night, presumably sheltering from the wind.</p>
<p>Outpost Disturbance</p>
<p>Since yesterday morning, the city has been disturbed by the hurricane's outpost. Clouds rose and leaped, and heavy rain fell from time to time. The air pressure was even lower in the afternoon, the sky was dim, and whirlwinds mixed with the rain. Recently, the Huangpu River happened to have high tides, and it is feared that it will coincide with the hurricane, resulting in water damage.</p>
<h3>US Transport Ship Black Hawk Comes to Shanghai from the Philippines</h3>
<p>After the US Navy stationed in Shanghai, only the Luzon and Guam small gunboats and the No. 36 gunboat that came to Shanghai last week were stationed in the Huangpu River after the cruiser Marblehead left Shanghai at the end of last month. Yesterday, the transport ship Black Hawk came to Shanghai from the Philippines. At 1:15 PM (Customs House time), it entered the Wusongkou and arrived at the Yangjingbang at about 3:00 PM, mooring at the British Navy pontoon with the No. 36 gunboat.</p>
<h3>French Municipal Council Forms Committee to Control Sublet Housing, Eradicating Exploitation of Subtenants, Ending Direct Subletting by Second Landlords</h3>
<p>The "China Press" reported that the French Concession Municipal Council recently formed a committee to investigate rents and leasing issues within the Concession. When the plan formulated by the committee is implemented, it is hoped that it can effectively control the subletting of houses and end the exploitation of subtenants. According to Mr. Goguel, Chairman of the Committee and Legal Counsel to the French Municipal Council,</p>
<p>Controlling Subletting</p>
<p>Requires the establishment of an agency between second landlords and subtenants. All subletting of surplus houses will be handled by the agency. The committee will allocate a house to serve as the agency's office space, and the agency will not work for personal gain, but will be an affiliated part of the committee. When the committee's plan is implemented, it will make direct subletting by private parties</p>
<p>Come to an End</p>
<p>The committee and its affiliated subcommittees are currently conducting extensive investigations into local leasing practices and the correct application of Chinese laws related to leasing. The committee, which was established by order of the French Consulate, recently held its first decision-making meeting to discuss various leasing issues and ways to resolve the acute leasing situation. It appointed Chinese, British, French, and Russian people to form subcommittees, with</p>
<p>The Most Chinese Members</p>
<p>The committee also appointed Chinese, British, French, and Russian lawyers to form a legal subcommittee to arbitrate disputes between landlords and tenants and, as far as possible, to avoid litigation. The honorary president of the committee is the French Consul General in Shanghai. Mr. Goguel concluded by saying that the committee is aware that this task is very difficult, but believes that the committee has the ability to achieve practical results that will benefit the public in the future.</p>
<h3>Japanese Company's Labor Strike Intensified Suppression, 180 People to be Dismissed, New Recruits to be Hired to Replenish</h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reported that the Japanese-language "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" published this morning (26th) that the Huazhong Metropolitan Automobile Transportation Company held a meeting on Sunday evening, deciding to take severe measures to deal with the company's labor strike, dismissing 180 Chinese mechanics, drivers, and female ticket sellers who participated in the strike, and deciding to hire 30 new drivers and 5 female ticket sellers, train them for five days, and then assign them to work on the buses. On Sunday, the operating hours of the company's bus routes were completely chaotic due to the strike, with each bus being separated by as much as ten minutes. Each bus was only five minutes apart.</p>
<h3>Resumption of Navigation to Wenzhou and Quanzhou Stalled, Yongfeng Suspends Departure, No Telegram from Shenfu Vessel</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese side, under the pretext of military needs, prohibited foreign ships from navigating to various ports along the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian, all routes have been suspended. Foreign ships were preparing to resume navigation to the ports of Quanzhou in Fujian and Wenzhou in Zhejiang. However, due to the intense fighting currently underway in Zhenhai and the concentration of Japanese warships along the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian, the ships that were to resume navigation have suspended departure again. Except for a few ships that have resumed navigation to the port of Songmen in eastern Zhejiang, all others are stalled. According to the reporter of "Xin Sheng She,"</p>
<p>Quanzhou Route</p>
<p>In addition to the Yilong Company's "Shen Shen" vessel, which resumed navigation from Shanghai to Quanzhou on the 19th of this month, the other two vessels of the Fusheng Company, the "Yongfeng" and "Xin An," were originally intended to follow suit, but have been repeatedly postponed due to the tense situation in Zhejiang and Fujian recently. As of yesterday, the two vessels were still moored in Yangshupu, and it is not known whether the Qiachang Company's "Shenfu" vessel has arrived in Quanzhou, and no telegram has been received. As for</p>
<p>Wenzhou Navigation</p>
<p>All the vessels that originally sailed on the Shanghai-Wenzhou route are now quietly awaiting the resumption order from the consular authorities. However, it is reported that the "Dasheng" vessel is scheduled to test sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou the day after tomorrow. It is not yet known whether the Customs will approve the test sailing.</p>
<h3>Customs Gold Unit to Remain Unchanged, Bank of China Continues to Publish Exchange Rates as Usual, Customs Gold Bonds Have Full Reserves</h3>
<p>Chinese currency has always been based on silver. The valuation and taxation of import and export goods at the Customs have always been calculated in Customs Taels. Since the end of 1929, the world's gold-silver parity has undergone drastic changes. The price of gold has soared and the price of silver has plummeted. Foreign exchange rates have become increasingly expensive. The loss from using cheap silver to pay for expensive gold expenditures internationally is self-evident. Moreover, the amount of foreign debt and reparations that China has incurred over the years is very large, and all principal and interest payments must be paid in gold coins converted from silver coins. Because the difference between the gold-silver parity has increased day by day, the payment of a large amount of silver coins is only enough to offset a small amount of gold coin debts. Therefore, China's finances are bound to feel increasingly unbearable. In order to remedy this, the "Customs Gold Unit" was implemented on February 1, 1930, as suggested by American monetary system expert Kemmerer, and gold coins were first collected for import duties. From May 1, 1931, export duties were also changed to be collected under this system. Since then, the Central Bank has published the exchange rate of the "Customs Gold Unit" daily. For example, the listed price on Saturday was two yuan, seven jiao, zero fen, seven li. As for the Customs Gold Exchange Notes and reserves issued by the Central Bank, as of December 31, 1937, the amount issued was 40,963,070, which was fully reserved in cash. The "Customs Gold Unit" system is uniformly followed by all Customs offices across the country and cannot be changed without authorization by the Customs offices in the occupied areas. It is reported that the Inspector General of Customs has denied the statement of changing the "Customs Gold Unit" system. Moreover, the system is very good and has been very smooth since its implementation.</p>
<h3>Silk Transit Duty at 7.5%, Customs Reassesses Value, Effective Yesterday</h3>
<p>A 7.5% transit duty will be levied on every ton (100 kilograms) of real silk, artificial silk fabrics, and silk, with the highest value assessed by the Jianghai Customs. According to the reporter of "Xin Sheng She," the Jianghai Customs believes that the previously assessed value is now quite out of line, which has greatly affected Customs revenue, so it has reassessed it as follows and has been effective since yesterday: (A) Real silk products: (1) Highest grade goods, Paris silk, finished woven by the factory, valued at 10,550 yuan; (2) Grade A goods, such as satin crepe and other flower twill, white or colored printed, etc., valued at 7,100 yuan, and silk gauze, Luo crepe, scarves, etc., white or colored flowers or plain white, produced in Hangzhou, Suzhou, Shengze, Shaoxing, Huzhou, valued at 5,200 yuan; (3) Grade B goods, silk finished products woven with coarse native silk, produced in Shengze, Hangzhou, and Huzhou, valued at 2,810 yuan; (B) Silk and artificial silk interwoven products (silk 24% to 40%, artificial silk 60% to 76%): (1) Georgette, white or colored printed, valued at 6,350 yuan; (2) Highest grade goods, velvet, valued at 3,500 yuan; (3) Ordinary goods, velvet white or colored engraved flowers, produced in Hangzhou and Suzhou, valued at 2,220 yuan; (4) Highest grade goods, satin crepe flowers and exquisite goods, white or plain, pre-dyed raw materials or printed woven products, three-color, valued at 5,810 yuan; (5) Ordinary goods, satin crepe flowers, etc., valued at 2,510 yuan; (6) Plain satin, produced in Hangzhou and Suzhou, valued at 3,160 yuan for the highest grade goods and 2,510 yuan for the lower grade goods; (C) All rayon fabrics, valued at 1,490 yuan; (D) Rayon and rayon cotton fabrics, valued at 1,540 yuan; (E) Rayon cotton, valued at 1,100 yuan; (F) Rayon cotton yarn interwoven products (containing 50% rayon), valued at 1,370 yuan.</p>
<h3>Father Jacquinot Stops Return to Europe, Still Very Concerned and Misses Shanghai's Charitable Undertakings</h3>
<p>Father Jacquinot, a philanthropist who left a deep impression on Shanghai, quietly left Shanghai last month, intending to return to Europe to rush to the national crisis. Later, he learned on the way that the war situation had changed, so he stayed in Hong Kong. It is now learned from relevant sources that the Father has decided to stop returning to Europe due to the change in the situation. It is also learned that the Father is still very concerned about various charitable undertakings in Shanghai. In addition to establishing the Nanshi Refugee Zone, the Father also serves as the President of the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association and a Standing Committee Member of the International Committee of the Chinese Red Cross Society.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Announces Summer Recess Dates, Until September 3rd</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Council of the Public Concession is in the height of summer, and the Western directors of the Board are on vacation in other ports, the Board usually holds a recess at this time. It is learned that the Bureau has scheduled a recess from July 25th (Thursday) to September 3rd (Tuesday), and will suspend meetings as usual. The Chinese and Western Bureau Directors have been notified separately by Chairman Keswick. At the same time, all committees such as Police, Public Works, Finance, Education, Public Health, and Music have also announced a recess.</p>
<h3>Standard Market Price of Coal Briquettes Still Undecided</h3>
<p>As the height of summer arrives, the use of coal briquettes has decreased, and market prices have fallen for days, now falling to 125 yuan. Store prices are 6 yuan, 3 jiao, and 4 fen per dan (100 market catties). However, all the existing coal dust is said to be controlled by the major coal companies, so the market price of coal dust is still fixed. The Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association held its 38th joint meeting of factory representatives yesterday afternoon to discuss (1) whether to continue to handle the eighth phase of the flat-price coal briquette case, (2) to ask for a joint discussion on the standard market price of coal briquettes. As a result, the above two cases are still pending further consultation at the next meeting.</p>

The Riverside Mansions are located at the intersection of North Suzhou Road and North Henan Road, and have been within the Japanese defense zone since September of last year.</p>
<h3>Family Bread – Limited Baking in Each Store</h3>
<p>According to the Price Investigation Department of the Municipal Council, some people have recently raised criticisms that "family bread" is not easy to buy. The Bureau previously agreed with the bakeries in the Public Concession (except for one or two) to bake and sell the bread according to the needs. According to the reports of the bakeries, its sales are not prosperous. Freshness is the most important thing for bread, and the stores cannot bake too much. If any citizens have difficulty purchasing this bread, they can write to the "Price Investigation Department" of the Bureau at 223 Hankou Road or call 12410 for inquiries.</p>

<h3>Streetcar Strike Resolved, All Workers Resumed Work Yesterday Morning, Apprentices Raise Demands for Increased Wages</h3>
<p>The strike of coppersmiths in the machine shop of the French streetcar company was resolved after the French Consul General, Mr. Aunin, came forward to persuade the parties. Labor and management held talks the day before yesterday, and the result was satisfactory. All 700 workers resumed work uniformly at 6:00 AM yesterday, expressing satisfaction with the five conditions of the negotiation result.

<h3>The Murder Suspect in the Tram Inspector Case Confesses to the Crime; Other Defendants Give Evasive Answers; Family of the Deceased Demands Compensation of 5,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Chen Guohua, Inspector No. 5 of the French Tram Company, was performing his duties on bus No. 849 of Route 21 on the afternoon of the 25th of last month. When the bus reached the gate of No. 181 Avenue du Pere Robert, he was suddenly shot and killed by Lu Rusheng. The murderer fled to Route Molliere and was arrested by Russian police who shot him in the waist. Based on Lu's confession, the mastermind Wu Senxiang (also known as Wu Laosan), Bian Jintang, Lü Dianchun, and suspects Xu Renchang, Zheng Yuntian, Lu Zhifa, Yuan Jinshan, Wan Shi'an, Wang Yaozhong, Lü Dianshu, Li Rongwen, Lü Anrong, Kuai Da'ao, Hu Tongyao, Xu Baomin, Yao Yulong, Wang Hongchang, Kong Wanxiang, Zhang Qingsheng, Sun Shaoyi, Chen Hongtao, Hu Wandong, Yan Pu, Luo Siwen, Zheng Bingliang, Gu Yuewen, Zhang Wanshi, Yao Debiao, and Xu Yongqing, a total of 30 people, were also arrested and sent to the Second Special Court. Except for Xu Renchang (a detective), who was found to have no connection to the case by the police and was released, the other defendants were prosecuted for murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law. The court hearing was postponed for further investigation. These details were reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday, the hearing continued. According to Lu Rusheng's confession, "Wu Senxiang is a friend of mine. Through Wu's introduction, I met Bian Jintang. In August last year, the deceased filed a report stating that Bian Jintang was not working effectively, which led to him being fired by the company."</p>
<p>Dismissed from Business</p>
<p>"His family of several had no food or clothing, so they asked me to kill Chen Guohua. On the 23rd of last month, Bian first took me to the Bund to identify the deceased. On the 24th, a fugitive named Wang Ziming gave me a gun at Bian's house. On the 25th, I, Wu, and Bian got on the bus on Songshan Road and followed the deceased to the Bund, but I couldn't do it because there were too many people. We returned and followed him to the last stop of Jinshenfu Road and Dapuqiao, but it was still inconvenient. Later, we followed him to the intersection of Jinshenfu Road and Avenue des Soeurs, where I finally had the</p>
<p>Opportunity to Strike</p>
<p>According to Wu Senxiang's confession, "Lu Hesheng shot and killed Chen at that time. Bian and I were lookouts. I only heard two gunshots, and I don't know anything else." Bian Jintang confessed, "In August last year, I was dismissed from my business by the company due to the deceased's report. Suddenly, my life was in a panic. The gun used by the murderer was not given by me to Lu Rusheng. It was given by the fugitive Wang Ziming. As for collecting five yuan from each ticket seller to hire a murderer, I know nothing about it. I also did not participate in the discussion at the Daji Inn, Room 213, Liyuanfang, Kangdi Road. However, when Chen Guohua was shot, I</p>
<p>Was Also on the Bus</p>
<p>Lü Dianchun said, "I have no grievances with the deceased, nor did I initiate the collection of five yuan from each ticket seller. The list of names found on my body was entirely because there was a famine in my hometown of Jiangbei, and I was preparing to hold a small meeting and take the money back to my hometown for relief. As for Lu Rusheng getting 200 yuan and Bian getting 50 yuan, I know nothing about it." When questioned, the other 25 defendants all claimed that they did not participate in the incident, did not know about Lü Dianchun collecting five yuan from each person, and did not pay the money. Finally,</p>
<p>The Mother of the Deceased</p>
<p>Chen Jia, and the wife of the deceased, Wang, brought the two daughters of the deceased, Chen Milu (9 years old) and Mixin (3 years old), to the court to seek justice for the deceased. Wang knelt down and cried, asking for justice. They also hired lawyer Huang Mingmin to file a civil lawsuit, demanding that all defendants be jointly and severally liable for compensating the plaintiffs for damages of 5,000 yuan in national currency. After questioning by Judge Zhang Minsheng, he ordered all defendants to be remanded in custody and await a further hearing on August 5th at 8:00 AM. The defendants' request for bail was denied.</p>
<h3>The Gas Company Labor Strike Intensifies; Gas Supply Disrupted; Gas Supply Suddenly Interrupted at Two Gas Plants; Explosion in the Plant, Technician Seriously Injured</h3>
<p>All workers at the old plant of the Greater Shanghai British Gas Company on Yu Qiaqing Road went on strike on the 19th due to unmet demands for improved treatment. Workers at the Yangshupu new plant followed suit and joined the strike the day before yesterday. The company hired White Russians to replace the workers, but due to a lack of work experience, the city's gas supply was disrupted and cut off yesterday. Both labor and management are sticking to their positions, and there has been no rapprochement. Eight workers at the Yangshupu plant were arrested, further exacerbating the tense labor situation. The Greater Shanghai News Agency has recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>Labor and Management Stand Firm</p>
<p>Since the old plant workers put forward 16 demands on the 19th, which were rejected by the company, the company issued a notice on the 20th, limiting all workers to return to work at the plant by 7:00 AM yesterday (the 22nd), otherwise they would be considered to have resigned and would not be paid. All the workers were enraged. At the same time, the workers at the Yangshupu new plant also went on strike yesterday in support of the old plant. In order to protect the interests of users, the company hired 54 White Russians to rush to the boiler room of the Yangshupu new plant to take over the work. The company set the time for the workers to return to work yesterday at 7:00 AM in the morning. At that time, all the workers stood firm and no one returned to work. The labor unrest is getting worse.</p>
<p>Gas Supply Cut Off at Two Gas Plants</p>
<p>The White Russians sent by the company to work at the Yangshupu new plant lacked work experience and did not know how to burn coal, which led to gas supply disruptions. Yesterday, the company's chief engineer, Mr. Sams, led more than a dozen Western staff to supervise and guide the workers at the new plant all day long. However, at 3:00 PM, the gas supply was suddenly cut off at the new and old garbage bridges. Users all over the city called the company to inquire, and the ringing did not stop until late at night. It was also learned that eight workers at the Yangshupu new plant were arrested yesterday morning. The workers sent representatives to the police station to demand their release, but as of last night, there were no results.</p>
<p>Chinese and Western Detectives on High Alert</p>
<p>Yesterday, dozens of disheveled White Russians gathered in front of the company's office on Yu Qiaqing Road, asking for work. They stood there all day long, waiting for news. The company also hired some White Russians to go to Yangshupu to work. Due to the tense situation, the company's chairman, Mr. Clavert, personally drove a truck to transport the White Russians to the plant. Detectives were dispatched by the police around the company to protect it. Chinese and Western detectives were also densely deployed around the Yangshupu new plant, on high alert. The most affected users in the two concessions were newspapers and public utility factories.</p>
<p>Company Secretary States Five Points</p>
<p>The reporter from the Greater Shanghai News Agency visited the company's secretary, Mr. W.J. Brown, yesterday afternoon and asked the following five questions, which are recorded as follows: (1) Reporter asked, "How is the White Russian working?" Answer, "Everything is very good. Although the supply was suspended for some time yesterday, it was immediately restored, because the White Russians are slower than the Chinese workers. Now because there are not enough White Russians and their skills are not very good, all the engineers in the company have gone to Yangshupu to help." (2) Asked, "What measures will be taken after the gas supply is cut off?" Answer, "We are considering it." (3) Asked, "It is said that the striking workers have put forward sixteen demands. Is this true?" Answer, "Because I (Brown) am a secretary, not an engineer, all matters related to the workers are handled by the Yangshupu plant, so I have not yet learned the details." (4) "Is the impact on the company significant?" Answer: "Absolutely not. We already have White Russians to replace them." (5) "What is the opinion of the company's management?" Answer: "Our opinion has been published in the advertisement column of the English Great China Evening News last night. The gist is that 'the company's management has made the greatest effort to supply gas for the convenience of users, and all sub-offices will be open for business from tomorrow (23rd).'"</p>
<p>Explosion Occurs, Technician Injured</p>
<p>According to the company, an explosion occurred in the plant yesterday morning, causing the company's assistant engineer, Mr. Keniger, to suffer serious head injuries. He was sent to the Country Hospital for treatment. The Public Works Department's police have not yet received a request for assistance. According to the Public Works Department spokesman yesterday, the police do not want to interfere unless there is a violation of the law or a disturbance of order.</p>
<p>Arrest of Workers at the New Plant</p>
<p>At about 10:00 AM yesterday morning, the police arrested eight workers at the Yangshupu new plant. According to the workers at the plant, the reason for the arrest was that the new plant had hired temporary Chinese workers to work in the factory since the day before yesterday. The striking workers learned of this and prevented the temporary workers from working at 10:00 AM yesterday morning. The company reported this to the police, who arrested them. The workers are now demanding their release.</p>
<h3>Social Miscellany</h3>

<h3>Finance: American Businesses Receive Telephone Calls From Home, There Are Rumors That the US Dollar Is Not Allowed To Be Shorted, American Banks Are Instead Absorbing Sterling To Profit Off The Difference, Market Trends Are Showing Signs of Sterling Loosening and the US Dollar Tightening</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market showed no significant changes in HSBC's listed prices, as operators were temporarily taking a wait-and-see approach. Trading became stable, and the trend showed a state of loosening of sterling and tightening of the US dollar. This was due to rumors that American banks received telephone calls from the US government last Saturday, prohibiting shorting the US dollar. Therefore, American banks frequently absorbed US dollars today, and arbitrage sold sterling. Also, foreign firms needed US dollar positions, so the underlying trend of the US dollar was slightly soft, and sterling became slightly harder. The closing price was the same as the afternoon closing price, with sterling at 3 pence 875 and the US dollar at 6 yuan 125, compared to the closing price last Saturday, sterling was harder by .015625 and the US dollar was tighter by .03125. The futures market lacked consultants, so it was even more stable.</p>
<p>Foreign Firms Also Have Settlements</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the exchange rate of sterling against the US dollar remained unchanged, against Shanghai it shrank by .0625, and against France there was no market. The central listed prices for all currencies remained the same. Banks opened the spot selling price in the morning, with sterling at 3 pence 84375 and the US dollar at 6 yuan 15625, compared to last Saturday's closing, the US dollar was flat and sterling was tighter by .015625, which was due to the slight drop in the exchange rate. After the opening, American banks first showed a willingness to supply, and the market was slightly harder. American banks and foreign banks were doing spot sterling at 3 pence 84375 to 875. HSBC's listed price was announced and remained unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was also announced with no increase or decrease. After this, foreign firms had some settlements, resulting in demand exceeding supply, and the price immediately softened. Foreign firms profited by purchasing spot US dollars from foreign banks at 6 yuan 125. Later, British banks such as Maijiali came to sell, and there were very few buyers, so the market was very quiet. Maijiali sold spot US dollars to American banks, and the price rose again to 6 yuan 15625. Until the close of the market, there was still a lack of change. As a result, sterling was 3 pence 875, the US dollar was 6 yuan 125, August sterling was 3 pence 84375, and August US dollar was 6 yuan 0625, compared to the morning spot price, sterling was longer by .03125, and the US dollar was tighter by .03125. August sterling was flat and the US dollar was also softer by .03125.</p>
<p>Afternoon Trading Not Much</p>
<p>The market remained calm in the afternoon, and not much trading took place. Chinese banks sold this month's US dollars to foreign banks at an average price of 6 yuan 15625. Sterling was not heard of being transacted. The closing price in the evening was exactly the same as the afternoon closing price, with sterling at 3 pence 875, the US dollar at 6 yuan 125, August sterling at 3 pence 84375, and August US dollar at 6 yuan 0625. Compared to the end of last week, spot sterling was longer by .015625, the US dollar was tighter by .03125, August sterling was flat, and sterling was also harder by .03125.</p>
<p>Hong Kong US Dollar Unstable</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 22nd (Monday) Telegraph, The exchange market opened flat this morning, but the US dollar is still volatile. The spot prices for British, Japanese, and Shanghai currencies are unchanged.

<p>Tianjin Exchange Rate Tightens</p>
<p>Tianjin, 22nd (Monday) Telegraph, The exchange market opened sluggish this morning. The spot prices for British and US currencies were each tighter by .03125, with the British currency at 3 pence 59375 and the US currency at 5 yuan 75. The Shanghai currency remained unchanged, remaining at 107 yuan 2 jiao and a half. The "Joint Note" dark market was slightly cheaper by 1 jiao and a half, at 93 yuan 6 jiao and a half.</p>
<h3>Short Selling Resurges: Gold Market Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash cooked gold dark market situation could not rise, because people lacked interest in buying. Short sellers were seen, even though the exchange market's US dollar was tightening. After entering the 5,300 yuan range, the gold price was difficult to break through. In the early morning, it was 5,300 yuan, down 45 yuan from last Saturday. Later, silver shops slightly absorbed, raising it by 20 yuan. However, the money exchange industry suddenly massively shorted, immediately falling to 280 yuan. Although silver shops and retail investors had recovered, the afternoon closing price was only 5,290 yuan. The market opened in the afternoon with silver shops selling at a low of 5,275 yuan, relying on securities firms to maintain it, improving by more than ten yuan. However, the need was ultimately low, and the evening closing price was only 5,285 yuan, resulting in a drop of 60 yuan. There was not much trading throughout the day, only about 2,000 taels. Silver shops eventually listed gold ornaments at a small ten yuan. Customs gold, etc., remained flat.</p>
<p>Cooked Gold Fell Sixty Yuan</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the morning, each tael (ten taels) initially weakened due to the loosening of the exchange market and slight public frustration. The market opened by pressing down 45 yuan. Silver shops did ten taels for 5,300 yuan. Then, relying on a certain silver shop and cash shop to absorb, it once rebounded by 20 yuan. Silver shops and peers entered dozens of taels for 5,320 yuan. After this, due to a certain money exchange industry throwing out some quantity, it fell by 40 yuan again. The money exchange industry sold ten taels to silver shops, losing 5,280 yuan. Then, a certain money exchange industry stopped throwing out and came back to enter a small number, and at that time, the public sentiment was still good, and there were many who took advantage of the low price to enter and do more, rising again by 30 yuan. The money exchange industry entered 50 taels to silver shops for 5,310 yuan. Around 11 o'clock, the number of buyers decreased, and scattered dealers saw the scene and ended, so it fell again by 20 yuan. Silver shops sold 20 taels to gold shops for 5,290 yuan. Later, gold shops sold ten taels to silver shops and peers, all for 5,285 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it fell by 60 yuan compared to the end of last week. The post-closing market trend was still strong, five yuan higher than the closing price, and there were no sellers. There were ups and downs of 45 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the cash shop's own-brand gold was tens of yuan higher than the cooked gold, and the reduction was reduced by 30 yuan. The current bid gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and they were not opened.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Listed at a Small Ten Yuan</p>
<p>At the beginning, the selling price of silver shop jewelry gold per tael was still 550 yuan for Datong Bank. By noon, it was reduced by ten yuan. After that, there was no change. Datong Bank changed to 540 yuan. The new colleagues were similar to the above price, and the collection was reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Past Week's Exchange Market: Observations on the Future of Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Economic Consulting Institute, last week's market fluctuated very little. The highest US dollar was 6 yuan 25, and the lowest was 5 yuan 84375. The highest British currency was 3 pence 9375, and the lowest was 3 pence 84375.</p>
<p>Although there was some ups and downs due to rumors of the abolition of free sterling, the stimulus was minimal. Since the expansion of the European affairs, international payments have mostly been settled in US dollars. Even if the sterling-US dollar exchange rate rises to the legal price of 4 yuan and 02 cents, the local exchange market may not be related to it. Examining the other fluctuating factors last week, according to market rumors, there are still the following points:</p>
<p>(1) International routes are blocked,</p>
<p>(2) Military operations are intensifying.</p>
<p>(3) Peace rumors are floating,</p>
<p>(4) The southward advance is gradually becoming active.</p>
<p>According to the recent market trends and its response to various news, it seems different from usual. Last year, when the US dollar grew from the 6 yuan mark to more than 9 yuan, the growth rate was more than 50%, but it immediately turned to shrink without hesitation. This time, it grew from 4 yuan 685 to more than 6 yuan, and the growth rate was also no less than 50%. For two months, it is still circling, and the market's response to various news is also very flat. For example, the blocking of international routes and the intensification of military operations are all enough to make foreign exchange tight, but in reality, nothing has happened. Furthermore, the peace news has been denied, but it has not softened the exchange market, which shows that the footing is firm, and the nation's belief in the legal currency is becoming more stable.</p>
<p>According to reports, with Konoe's rise to power, the southward advance policy will be carried out as soon as the opportunity arises. Once it becomes a reality, the military power of that country will inevitably be concentrated on the new target, then China's war situation may change, and the line of sight will shift, and the local situation may turn to stability. As the world war expands, the possibility of the United States being involved in the whirlpool is increasing. Then, the funds to escape will inevitably return, and the deposits of foreign banks in China will also have a subtle effect, inevitably throwing out foreign exchange in order to cope with it. At the same time, with the outbreak of the war, the legal currency's foreign exchange target is becoming more dangerous, and with the obstruction of transportation, the actual need is reduced, then the nation's interest in foreign exchange is becoming weaker. The banks in this port, which are known for arbitrage, have seen a decrease in activity in recent days. If the southward advance is active, the United States may further implement an embargo, then the need for legal currency will increase to purchase China's raw materials, then the so-called southward advance may have a constructive effect on the exchange market.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Weakens Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw cooked gold fall again. British and American gold pounds also fell by one and a half yuan each. The supply and demand of British gold notes was balanced, and the market price remained flat. The American gold notes were still circling in a narrow range and eventually fell by seven cents. Canadian notes were very soft. The demand for Japanese gold notes was very high, and the market price rose again. The evening market was one yuan two jiao one and a half cents. The demand for Korean notes was surprisingly high, and the evening market was as high as one yuan zero five and a half cents. There was also no shortage of demand for Hong Kong notes, and the market price rose by two cents.</p>
<h3>Grains: Soybean Prices Do Not Loosen Due To Transportation Issues</h3>
<p>The transaction of beans in miscellaneous grains is extremely narrow. The brokers in the market only ask for prices, but there is no actual transaction. The movement of dozens of bags in this street depends on the city's weakness. However, due to the difficulty in transporting and the high cost, most cargo owners are unwilling to sell cheaply, so the trend is still not repairing. At present, various high-quality cargo plates are in a plain situation, while medium and secondary goods are still falling. Yesterday, only 200 bags of Qingdao soybeans were transacted, the price is detailed in the market price bar, 50 bags of Xiashi soybeans, 150 bags of Pudong broad beans, 50 bags of Zhangyan broad beans, 50 bags of Beigang green-skinned broad beans, more than 100 bags of Minhang Nangang green-skinned broad beans, more than 50 bags of Liuhe broad beans, 100 bags of Wuhu small-grain white-skinned broad beans, and only 170 bags of Mingguang mung beans.</p>
<h3>Food: Common Japonica Touches the Seventy Yuan Mark Again, 150,000 Bags Arrived Yesterday, Foreign Rice Is Still Insisting on Not Releasing</h3>
<p>The rice market opened for the first time yesterday after the holiday. Customers and merchants on this street had to wait for a long time for transportation passports, and it was difficult to wait for a long time. Customers and merchants took advantage of the instability of the Zhejiang and Fujian sea frontiers and firmly refused to release the goods. The city presented a situation of less output and more input, and the situation was agitated, and the rising wind continued. As a result, each price rose step by step in the shouting, increasing by one yuan compared to the previous week. The closing price of No. 1 Chen Saigon was 56 yuan and a half, Xin Jian 56 yuan, No. 2 53 yuan and a half, 53 yuan, Chen 54 yuan, No. 1 Siam 56 yuan and a half, 56 yuan, No. 2 53 yuan, Huojiao 56 yuan, 55 yuan and 7 jiao, Hong Kong Jian 55 yuan, 54 yuan and a half, No. 2 53 yuan 8 jiao, Tokyo broken Jian was high from 50 yuan, followed by 47 yuan, broken Jian 43 yuan and a half, followed by 41 yuan and a half, rice mung 45 yuan and a half, 45 yuan.</p>
<p>In terms of road goods, the cargo owners also thought that it was difficult to draw a line for the future and that there was a risk of shipping, so they were unwilling to sell the stored rice cheaply. In addition to the new batches of road goods being received and paid for by the Shantou gang, the cargo side also directly allocated them to the local customers. Therefore, the cargo side regarded the loading of the Nianhao in the last month as the delivery of the goods and the loading of the 26th in the last month as a rare commodity. Because the floating goods on the market have been exhausted, the customers and merchants welcome them because they are fresh. The opening price of the 26th loading was still 61 yuan 2 jiao, only 2 jiao higher than last Saturday. It then reached 63 yuan from 61 yuan and a half to 62 yuan, which was 2 yuan higher than last week. The opening price of the 20th loading for immediate delivery jumped up by 2 yuan to 62 yuan, and then increased by 3 jiao to 62 yuan 3 jiao, which was 2 yuan 3 jiao higher. The current rice has also risen from 1 yuan to 2 yuan. The total transaction of current rice was about 8,900 bags, and the recycled original bags were more than 500 tons.</p>
<p>A total of 1,340 bags of japonica and glutinous domestic rice arrived, of which japonica rice accounted for the majority. It is rumored that the transaction in the dark market is also active because foreign rice continues to be expensive. Therefore, the selling price of japonica rice has been raised, and the price of fresh special Qing japonica has reached the 70 yuan mark. Special Qing japonica is 68.9 yuan, Wuxi Qing japonica is 68 yuan, Changzhou Su Kun japonica is high from 67.8 yuan, followed by Suxu 62.3 yuan, Qingsi Bo rice is 68 yuan, Nangang Hu early is 61 yuan, and the road for glutinous rice is slightly worse, with only half a yuan added. Liyang special yuan is 64 yuan and a half, Jintan special yuan is 64 yuan, 63 yuan and a half, Changdan Baiyuan is 62.3 yuan, and Hong Kong glutinous rice is 61 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign rice has also arrived in Shanghai. The other day, Yihe Foreign Company Taisheng transported 2,095 bags from Haiphong and 12,942 bags from Hong Kong, for a total of 15,037 bags. The arrival in Shanghai coincided with Sunday and began unloading yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Wheat Cargo Owners Want to Get Compensation From Chinese Factories, But Are Also Suffering From Not Being Able to Fly Over, Miscellaneous Brands of Flour Are Flooding the Market</h3>
<p>Flour was the beginning of the week yesterday, and the transaction of current flour continued to be quiet. The Japanese factory flour and domestic miscellaneous brand flour are flooding the market, which has reduced the sales of Chinese flour. The factory is also not accommodating because of the difficulty in purchasing raw materials. The price of the No. 2 flour factory is still 16 yuan. Most of the customers on this street think it is expensive. The two factories have only issued 3,400 bags. Other various miscellaneous flours are all fighting each other. There are many dark sales with customers. It is heard that the Phoenix brand only opens at 14 yuan 7,8 jiao, and the Jinshan brand is 15 yuan 6,7 jiao, but they are all in the sound of rejection.</p>
<p>The wheat market was still dim yesterday. The new arrivals in Hongkou, in addition to a few being distributed to Japanese factories, the general cargo owners wanted to sell at a good price to Chinese factories, but they were unable to transport them into the concession. The foreign wheat that Chinese factories negotiated to order has not been agreed due to transportation and ship location issues, so the market has become more silent.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Slightly Improves</h3>
<p>The securities dark market slightly strengthened yesterday after four days of small trading, and trading gradually decreased. The lively scene on the 16th has become a past. However, it cannot be concluded that there is no hope. A few days of small decline is just the aftereffect of a big rise. There are currently a lot of mixed messages, which cannot be investigated. Speculators are also taking the opportunity to wait and see, but it is still not valued by all parties. However, it is still brewing, which is an indisputable fact. The issue of principal and interest has been determined to be no problem after a period of rumors. There are people buying interest coupons at 95% discount, and there should still be a dawn in the future. Yesterday's situation showed that the positions of both the bulls and the bears were in a state of no chaos, and they were still the same as before. The result of the competition between the bulls and the bears in the two markets was that the market situation turned from low to high. As a result, each debt slightly improved by 2 jiao to 3 jiao and a half. The total number of transactions was more than 600,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category Maximum Minimum Closing Compared to the Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A 62.80 62.70 62.75 Up .30</p>
<p>Unified B 53.35 53.20 53.35 Up .35</p>
<p>Unified C 51.80 51.50 51.65 Up .20</p>
<p>Unified D 50.55 50.50 50.55 Up .20</p>
<p>Unified E 51.00 50.90 50.00 Up .0</p>
<p>Stock trading, 100 shares of China National Goods Company were transacted, with a price of 26 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, in the stock market of the Public Trade Association yesterday, there was some profit-taking in the morning. In the afternoon, people's hearts suddenly turned prosperous, and industrial stocks and rubber stocks both strengthened at the same time. The shares of the three trust companies soared from low prices, and the rise was strong.</p>
<h3>Yarn Flowers: Double Horse Yarn, Factory Opens 3,600 Bales</h3>
<p>The yarn market is stagnant and lacks distinct characteristics. However, industry peers and retail speculators remain reluctant to loosen their grip. Consequently, the market has become a tug-of-war. Actual sales, however, remain sparse and unsatisfactory, resulting in an exceptionally sluggish market, with a desolate atmosphere on the trading floor.</p>
<p>The opening atmosphere in the yarn market this morning was dispersed. Coupled with reports of escalating conflicts in eastern Zhejiang, sellers did not actively promote sales. 20-count Double Horse yarn opened at $915, falling to $910. However, despite the initial low price, major players remained inactive, with only smaller entities and scalpers releasing some holdings. Consequently, the market remained relatively stable, hovering around $920 for a considerable time. Nearing 11:00 AM, with no reported changes in foreign exchange rates, and scalpers finding no further profit opportunities, they were forced to cover their positions. As a result, the market gradually rebounded to $929. The closing price saw a slight setback. A midday tally showed 1,570 bales traded, with the market up by $6. Yesterday, 50 bales of cotton yarn arrived from Hong Kong, and today, 70 bales were shipped to Xiamen. The quantities purchased by various trading groups are listed below:</p>
<p>Industry peers: 1,490 bales, Hong Kong: 70 bales</p>
<p>Mainland: 10 bales, Total: 1,570 bales</p>
<p>In the afternoon, news arrived that the Shenxin No. 9 Factory opened with 20 bales, priced at $945, with a deposit of $110 per bale, to be cleared in August and September. It is said that these were all accepted by industry peers.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Remains Quiet</h3>
<p>Current cotton trading shows little development. This is because foreign cotton prices are still declining, and silk sales are sluggish, resulting in a lack of large-scale business. However, with the Shenxin No. 9 Factory having released a large quantity of cotton yarn, there may be a replenishment of raw materials, which has slightly boosted market confidence.</p>
<p>Another report indicates that foreign cotton market prices, particularly in New York, appear weak due to favorable weather conditions in cotton-growing regions and the sale of some spot goods. As a result, closing prices fell by three to four points compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market yesterday, including forecasts, fell by six rupees.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton trade has been particularly quiet recently, with all parties adopting a wait-and-see approach. Factory inventories are not abundant, and cotton stocks on the market are also low. Therefore, should market conditions improve slightly, factories will promptly make purchases. Transactions among industry peers have also been remarkably quiet recently.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Raw Silk Supply Cut Off, Most Transactions in Mainland</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Yokohama silk market saw spot prices at $1,350, near-term futures at $1,385, and long-term futures at $1,383. These figures show little change compared to the end of last week. Foreign firms experienced sporadic silk sales, with some accounts from New York. However, mainland silk thread cannot reach Shanghai. Currently, tussah silk thread is fetching $3,400, nearly $1,000 more than prices paid by Japanese merchants purchasing in the mainland. Yesterday, White Factory 81 was offered at $5,150, but the number of bales was limited. The pressure from "controlled" trade is increasing daily. Consequently, the export silk market is likely to come to a standstill, as British and French firms are unable to compete with Japanese merchants. Simultaneously, many silk threads that cannot be shipped are transacted within the mainland. There is a possibility that the center of the silk market may shift. Local silk factories are currently facing a dire situation due to the disruption of transportation between Shanghai and Zhejiang, with raw silk materials being completely cut off. Recently, several silk factories have successively suspended operations, and the future appears bleak.</p>
<p>Today, nine bales of silk thread were shipped to Hong Kong, and five bales, along with 200 boxes of tea, were shipped to Singapore.</p>
<h3>Coal: Coal Briquette Black Market Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>The coal briquette market has seen heated price competition among industry peers in recent days, leading to further price declines. Following the reduction in prices last weekend, a certain factory launched a major distribution drive yesterday, causing the black market price to fall by another $6, setting the price at $126 per ton, delivered by truck, with additional charges for transportation. Consequently, smaller factories, in order to survive, have followed suit in reducing prices, causing the prices at street-level vendors to become exceptionally chaotic and inconsistent.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse White Slightly Easier</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market remained stable. The guild's price for spot goods was $68.30 for second-grade coarse white sugar produced by local factories, unchanged. Foreign warehouse prices were $68.20, and transshipment goods were $52.65, with 30-day delivery at $53.20, all minor adjustments. Taikoo Refineries' White B mark remained at $78, HX mark at $75, Dutch Red at $58, local factory Snow White at $68.50, No. 1 White at $68, with Nos. 2, 3, and 4 being returned. Local ice sugar showed fluctuations. Domestic sugar still lacks continued openings. Also, 1,700 tons of sugar arrived from the Netherlands yesterday.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: Xu-style Vegetables Soon to be Available</h3>
<p>According to quick reports from customers, a small quantity of the first batch of new Xuzhou golden daylily buds has already been shipped and is expected to arrive in Shanghai soon. This batch is experimental in nature, so the quantity is small. It is reported that there was a poor harvest in the production area, and later batches are unlikely to arrive in large quantities.</p>
<h3>Metals: Canadian Lead Declines</h3>
<p>The Canadian lead market has shown a downward trend recently, as local businesses have been experiencing slow sales. Coupled with a lack of confidence in the Shanghai market and sluggish market conditions, prices have declined. Currently, the selling price is around $110 per picul.</p>

<p>Lacquer</p>
<p>The use of lacquer in China has been prevalent since the time of the Five Emperors, and continues to this day. Commentators consider it unmatched in the world. However, few know that the West has even more ingenious methods of producing lacquer. Lacquer powder is available in five colors, all radiant and eye-catching. Few Chinese are aware of this. In the treaty ports, it is used to some extent, but it is difficult to trace its origin.</p>
<p>Hoarding Money is Useless</p>
<p>A man surnamed Weng from Suzhou was known for his meanness and skill in accounting. Throughout his life, he accumulated a vast fortune through usury and exploitation. He had one son who was fond of pleasure. Fearing that his son would squander his wealth, Weng secretly dug a hole under his bed and hid silver inside. One day, Weng awoke to hear rustling sounds from the hole. He opened the brick to investigate and suddenly a weasel jumped out and bit Weng's hand, nearly severing his finger. Weng cried out in pain and collapsed. His son heard the noise and entered the room, seeing the hidden gold. However, Weng's vigilance was so tight that he never left the gold unguarded, leaving no opportunity to seize it. Weng's neighbor, a leather worker, was a known rogue. His son conspired with him, hiding in the leather worker's house for several days. The leather worker then went to Weng and falsely claimed that his son was gambling in some place and had lost a large sum of money. He urged Weng to quickly retrieve him, otherwise there might be trouble. Weng believed him and hired a boat to go there. Meanwhile, the son and the leather worker dug through the wall and stole everything, escaping with the loot. Weng returned home to find that both his money and his son were gone, and he was overwhelmed with grief.</p>

<h3>Wisdom Obscured by Greed</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I now have a difficult problem to ask you to solve on my behalf. I believe you are a mentor to the readers, and I hope you will not refuse my request!</p>
<p>I am a seventeen-year-old unmarried girl who has completed junior high school. My father was a legitimate businessman before the war, and our family's financial situation was not too bad. After fleeing to Shanghai during the war, my father never had a proper job. He did some speculative business and made some money, and suddenly our family's spending became extravagant. My father and mother lived very luxuriously, and my father made friends with a group of high-class loafers, so his thinking was greatly influenced. Recently, his speculation failed, and our finances inevitably suffered a setback. He had the wild idea to force me to become a dancer, hoping to make a fortune from me. This kind of behavior, where wisdom is obscured by greed and basic human nature is extinguished, truly makes me want to cry. For the sake of my own future happiness, I have politely refused and delayed. But my father insists on his own way, disregarding everything. I heard that he has already reached an agreement with the manager of a certain dance hall, and it seems that the day I am forced into a fiery pit is not far off. I have a lover, Mr. So-and-so, who is loyal, honest, young, and handsome, and currently works at a bank in Shanghai with a decent income. My father and mother initially valued him quite a bit. But now, because they have other intentions, they no longer allow me to see him. The day before yesterday, I tried every means to meet with him and told him this unfortunate news. At first, he was shocked, and then he shed tears. I know that he is very willing to help me, but because of various concerns (the biggest reason being that I am underage), he can't think of a proper solution. I now feel that my father's behavior has no paternal love at all, so why should I be foolishly filial and let him slaughter me, sacrificing my bright future? I have now decided that if necessary, I will leave the family and run away alone. I have a few questions, and I respectfully ask for your guidance:</p>
<p>(1) My father is forcing his daughter to engage in a lowly profession. Can I hire a lawyer to negotiate and formally separate from the family?</p>
<p>(2) After I run away, my father will surely suspect that it was my friend's idea, and he may go to negotiate with him, but without evidence, I don't think he will be guilty of anything?</p>
<p>(3) How many charitable organizations in Shanghai provide relief to women? I want to go there for help in an emergency. Is that possible? (Please provide the locations.)</p>
<p>Please answer the above points in "Free Talk" within a few days. I would be endlessly grateful.</p>
<p>Respectfully wishing you</p>
<p>Good health! A weak woman, Wen, July 15th.</p>
<p>After receiving the above letter, we are truly speechless. In a place like Shanghai, there are countless women who are as unfortunate as Ms. Wen, or even a hundred times more unfortunate. In the eyes of some parents, children are simply their personal property, a goose that lays golden eggs, to be raised for wealth. As long as there is a profit to be made, even the children's bodies and souls can be sold off. Such people are not only pitiable but also hateful!</p>
<p>At this time, unconditionally hating such parents is certainly not the solution. Fundamentally, the education they received is a problem, and the social environment certainly has a great influence on them. A person who cannot fight hard against a bad social environment and cannot live a simple material life with perseverance can also be said to be a failure of education. (The education I am referring to includes family education, school education, social education, and self-education.)</p>
<p>Fundamentally, this is of course a social problem, but before the transformation of the entire society is completed, we should do our best to help women who are ambitious and willing to work for a brighter future, and not let them fall into a fiery pit.</p>
<p>For women in Ms. Wen's situation, for the sake of self-defense, we believe that they should strive for independence in life and economics to avoid the suffering of being displaced and homeless when leaving their families. Regarding resisting family oppression, we hope that Ms. Wen will immediately go to the Child Protection Section attached to the Industrial Department of the Public Works Bureau at 209 Jiangxi Road to see the lady in charge. We have already contacted them, and they are very concerned and sympathetic towards oppressed weak women who are unwilling to fall into depravity, and are willing to help as much as possible. We are sorry that we cannot answer the other points one by one.</p>

<h3>Ink</h3>
<p>— Shu Wen</p>
<p>Staring blankly at the dried-up ink bottle, it feels as if my own lifeblood has also withered away.</p>
<p>I feel a wave of emptiness, infinitely and depressingly surging into my heart.</p>
<p>A month ago, I bought a bottle of Parker ink with great joy. At that time, I had just started a writing project, and everything was pleasant and full of vitality. How delicate and crystalline was that full bottle of blue ink! It symbolized a healthy young man full of fresh vitality, who could move, jump, and be arrogantly invincible. Looking at it, one would inexplicably become excited. I caressed it again and again, lovingly placed it in the paper box, and from then on, I relied on it to write and scribble on sheets of manuscript paper. It followed the tip of my gold pen, obeying my will, twisting left and sweeping right, gradually merging with my lifeblood. When I wrote late into the night and my eyes became blurred, I often vaguely saw the blue handwriting shining with brilliant peach-red light. This light was familiar to me. It was a symbol of my lifeblood, the essence of my spirit that had been pondered and condensed. Ah! How happy I was! Caressing each blue character, as solid and rugged as a relief, and the gradually thickening original manuscript was even more comforting, making me smile. I glanced at the ink bottle, grateful to it, knowing that it would always be full, always vibrant, and always merge with my lifeblood to imprint clear characters.</p>
<p>For three months, my days passed happily like this.</p>
<p>My nerves became more and more tense, and the work felt more and more continuous and late into the night. The ink helped me send one manuscript after another back to the drawer, from one hundred pages to two hundred pages to three hundred pages. Ah, my heart wanted to fly lightly into the sky. I was no longer afraid of the heat, no longer worried about fatigue, only felt that the energy I had accumulated was as abundant as the ink, and I vigorously sent the ink onto the paper...</p>
<p>However, when I finished writing the last word, the ink dried up, the ink ran out.</p>
<p>I was empty, as if the energy that had been tense for three months had suddenly relaxed and withered. I was too weak to move. My heart kept sinking, leaving a boundless wilderness in the middle.</p>
<p>Caressing the original manuscript of 200,000 words, I mournfully mourned the empty ink bottle with mixed feelings of joy and sorrow, and the lovely ink that had been used up on these hundreds of pages of original manuscript.</p>
<p>The Hawthorne Detective Cases</p>
<h3>The Dancer's Fate</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Conflicting Information</p>
<p>Hawthorne nodded and said, "Yes, that inference is very interesting—ah, you said you also went to see a play last Sunday night. What was the situation when you came home that time?"</p>
<p>Old Mao said, "That was very different from last night. The play ended after 1:00 AM. When I returned here, the lights were off upstairs and downstairs, and the main door was locked. I opened the door and went back to my room to sleep. Nothing was unusual."</p>
<p>Hawthorne threw away the cigarette butt and said again, "Okay, last night, after you entered the gate, you went back to your guardhouse and didn't come to this living room, did you?"</p>
<p>Old Mao said, "No—sir, you understand that I shouldn't come in."</p>
<p>"Then, after returning to your room, what did you do?"</p>
<p>"I already told you. I took some Po Sum On Medicated Oil, drank a cup of cold tea, and went to sleep immediately. I fell asleep as soon as I lay down."</p>
<p>"So, you didn't know when the guest left?"</p>
<p>"I really don't know. After I fell asleep, I was only awakened by the sound of the gunshot. When I got dressed and put on my shoes and came out, I saw that the main door was still ajar and unlocked. At that time, Old Man Li and Jinmei had also come downstairs. I heard Old Man Li shouting in the living room: 'Who killed her? Who killed her?' Only then did I realize that Miss Wang had had an accident. I walked up the stone steps and saw that the front door was open. I turned on the electric light at the door and found several strange footprints on the floor inside the door. I shouted, and Old Man Li and Jinmei also came out."</p>
<p>"You covered the footprints with wooden boards at that time?"</p>
<p>"Yes, because I already knew that there was a strange guest in the middle of the night, and it was raining, so these footprints on the floor were certainly very important. I went back to my room, took out a few floorboards, and covered the footprints before coming in."</p>
<p>Hawthorne nodded. This nodding action seemed to be contagious, influencing Inspector Ni. I remember that when Ni Jinshou heard Jinmei's report just now, he suspected why Old Mao paid special attention to these footprints. Now, after hearing his explanation, he clearly also thought it was reasonable, so he nodded involuntarily.</p>
<p>Hawthorne asked again, "Tell me more. What happened after that?"</p>
<p>Old Mao said, "We discussed it for a while. Jinmei suggested calling Manager Lu and Miss Jiang to report. Because Miss Jiang is Miss Wang's best friend and often comes and goes here. She also came here yesterday afternoon. When Jinmei was making the call, I accompanied Old Man Li to Miss Wang's room on the second floor to take a look. Nothing was unusual. The bedding on her bed was neatly made, and she hadn't slept in it, as if Miss Wang hadn't gone upstairs after coming back." (53)</p>

<h3>Life, Death, and Demons</h3>
<p>— Zhou Wu</p>
<p>How do we distinguish between life and death?</p>
<p>Doctors say: when people can continue to breathe, they have life; when breathing stops, they are considered dead.</p>
<p>But the life and death that I am about to talk about are different from what doctors say. If a person lives in the world, living without meaning, without any help or benefit to human society, then what is the difference between that and death? Furthermore, if society has an added burden because of him, he is a burden to society, it would be better if he were dead.</p>
<p>There is a saying that everyone is familiar with: "Death can be heavier than Mount Tai or lighter than a feather." In fact, this is also true of "life." Therefore, I give the following solemn definitions to "life" and "death":</p>
<p>Whoever lives and contributes to human society, who is beneficial, can be called "life."</p>
<p>Whoever lives without meaning and without benefit to human society is the same as when breathing stops, and is called "death."</p>
<p>Those who live and harm human society are neither "life" nor "death." There is no way to call them, so they can only be called "demons."</p>
<h3>Is There a Heavenly Father? (2)</h3>
<p>Secondly, we should also remember that human beings are closely related and interdependent; we receive help and benefits from others, and sometimes we are also affected by the bad things that others do. Because human beings are so closely connected, the "law of sacrifice" comes into play. In other words, someone often suffers for others, or some people suffer for the majority. In terms of these material disasters, it seems to say that some people must suffer so that the majority can survive. We may not be able to understand this point, but it is very clear that the world is made according to this plan. And on our part, we cannot say that there is another or better way to create the world. In this matter, our intelligence is not enough.</p>
<p>It may not be easy for us to understand this fact, but we should also remember that in raising humanity, the "law of sacrifice" is precisely a "law of progress." When these natural disasters occur, people are killed or suffer major losses, often arousing humanity to express its noblest qualities—to express morality, which may not be expressed in ordinary circumstances. The suffering of others causes heroic actions, and also moves people to express sympathy and generous assistance, all of which have the effect of raising humanity to a higher level. Moreover, these things also give people warnings, indicating the need to do everything possible to take precautions against such dangers. Because of these dangers, people living near volcanoes and earthquakes must find ways to build suitable houses that can withstand such shocks, or plant sandalwood trees, or protect forests, on the one hand, to prevent sudden floods, and on the other hand, to help prevent frequent famines.</p>
<p>Studying this issue from this perspective, we see that although these natural disasters cause many people to lose their lives and suffer, the result may benefit all mankind a great deal. Because from experience, people will gain much progress in understanding and grasping the forces of nature, able to control the greatest destructive power of natural disasters, or at least learn their time and season of occurrence, causes, and methods, and be able to avoid the worst consequences they cause.</p>
<p>From this point of view, it seems that some people in this world sometimes have to suffer for the benefit of the majority. Why is this? We don't know! However, if humanity generally benefits and generally progresses, we should not delay in saying that the God of humanity is not good. Instead, we should rely on His wisdom and believe that He has a plan to benefit humanity. As for those who encounter death in natural disasters, although it is unfortunate, we should remember that "death" is not an absolute disaster for the individual, because there is an afterlife beyond death.

<p>Since Germany launched the war, according to the National Socialist Party's policy, all entertainment businesses were to be suspended first under wartime conditions. But this attempt was immediately found to be a mistake, and the plan to control the entertainment industry was changed, and even dance halls resumed business.</p>
<p>Now, in major cities in Germany, theaters, cinemas, cafes, nightclubs, and dance halls of all sizes have reopened one after another, and their business has unexpectedly become abnormally developed, even more lively than before the war. On Saturday nights, all places are packed, with extravagant extravagance, singing and dancing, and no one can tell that Germany is at war.</p>
<p>The plays staged in theaters emphasize the "art" aspect, and most of them are scripts with classical overtones, and comedies are rarely staged. However, small dance halls still restore the pre-war female nude performances and are not as serious as theaters.</p>
<p>In terms of movies, all cinemas screen German-made new films, and Italian and American films are only occasionally screened once or twice.</p>
<p>Nightclubs and dance halls are filled with jewelry and well-dressed guests, because people with money in their hands have no other use for it, so they pretend to take advantage of the good news of Germany's military victories in successive battles to enjoy themselves greatly. At the same time, many young people also want to indulge themselves and have fun before being conscripted.</p>
<h3>Meeting with Southern Movie Queen Li Qinian</h3>
<p>— Jing Wen</p>
<p>Southern Movie Queen Li Qinian, who has been rumored for a long time to be coming to Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai on the 21st at 5:00 PM. The reporter, awed by the movie queen's great reputation, immediately visited Ms. Li at her temporary residence—the Jinmen Hotel.</p>
<p>In a very elegantly furnished room, I met the long-admired Ms. Li, an oval face with two intoxicating dimples. Although she had a bit of a tired look from traveling, her graceful and dignified manner was enough to prove that this southern movie queen was indeed worthy of her name.</p>
<p>What surprised me very much was that she was so frugal. In my ideal, she was determined to show off her clothing, be extraordinarily gorgeous, and extraordinary, when she came to Shanghai. I did not expect that she wore no makeup, and other than a blue cloth cheongsam, she wore no ornaments, but this kind of dress was even more sufficient to show her beauty—her many charms. This may be what the ancients praised as beauty, the so-called "disheveled hair and rough clothes, natural charm."</p>
<p>What surprised me even more was her fluent Mandarin, which almost made me think that she was not born in the South, but was a daughter of Youyan.</p>
<p>Looking at Ms. Li's facial contours, I couldn't help but recall the deceased generation of artist—Ruan Lingyu. Ms. Li's facial features really have a resemblance to Ms. Ruan. To be honest, among the actresses in the history of Chinese cinema, only Ms. Ruan's polished acting skills can make me fall in love, and it can be said that they can make the entire film audience fall in love unanimously.</p>
<p>Now that Ms. Ruan has died with regret and left the thousands of viewers. The successor of these polished acting skills, of course, we cannot but place infinite hope on Ms. Li, and at the same time, we hope that Ms. Li can develop and promote it. Then, Ms. Li's trip to Shanghai this time can be said to be worthwhile.</p>
<p>Work hard! Ms. Li! The crown of this polished acting skill is also waiting for you here.</p>
<p>According to the Sea Star Society, Li's first impression of Shanghai was that it was less beautiful than Hong Kong, but more magnificent. Li's physique is particularly healthy and beautiful, and her low frown and shallow smile are quite seductive, which is a different flavor from Chen Yunshang's petite and exquisite figure.</p>
<h3>Yang Shengchun's Battle of Puyang</h3>
<p>— Only Me</p>
<p>The other day, I listened to Guqu's new play, "The Battle of Puyang" by Yang Shengchun, which was full of wonderful performances and was truly a masterpiece. It is impossible not to record it.</p>
<p>According to "The Battle of Puyang," this play is a martial arts play exclusive to Fuli Cheng. This play is a laborious play for martial arts actors, and it is extremely difficult to sing. The heaviness of the martial arts work is no less than "Eight Great Hammers," and although it is a heavy fight, there are many gestures, so it has the same wonderful effect as "Zhen Tanzhou." It is not suitable for young and strong people to sing (the role of Lu Bu must be handsome), and it is impossible to sing without a considerable foundation in martial arts. It is also impossible for young, strong, and martial arts people with a foundation to sing without good supporting roles, because the Dian Wei and Cao Cao in this play have a close relationship with the protagonist Lu Bu. It is difficult to be wonderful if they are not well-matched.</p>
<p>In the past, Ru Fulan was most famous for this play. At that time, Ru Fulan was young, handsome, and had good martial arts skills. He had all the conditions for singing "The Battle of Puyang." In addition, his hitting partner, Han Fuxin's Dian Wei, was wonderfully accurate, and the red flowers and green leaves complemented each other, which made a wonderful play. After Ru Fulan, this play was most able to be mobilized by Ye Shenglan, but after Shenglan left school, he had few opportunities to perform this play due to environmental constraints. So Yang Shengchun came from behind and performed this play wonderfully, with a general idea of replacing Ru Fulan.</p>
<p>Looking at Shengchun's performance, it can be said to be perfect. Those who can do this must also have the various conditions that Shengchun has said that he should have for acting in this play. (1) Shengchun is young and strong, and his appearance is unrestrained, which is exactly in line with Lu Bu's identity. His appearance when he enters the scene has the majesty of a great general, and his eyebrows show the spirit of a hero, without a trace of powder, which is valuable. (2) Shengchun's martial arts foundation is good, and his gestures and posture are very good-looking. There is an exit gesture that requires a halberd and feather, which matches the scene and is exactly in line with the drum beats. The entry of the last scene with the raised leg and big turn shows skill. (3) The fight is tight. This point is due to the good supporting roles. Han Shengxin's Dian Wei is extremely experienced and has a seamless fight with Shengchun. The fight scene in this play is the most laborious, because Dian Wei holds double halberds and Lu Bu holds a single halberd. It is extremely difficult to fight with halberds. Shengxin is Shengchun's old partner. When fighting, they fight together, neatly and crisply, which can be said to be wonderful. There are very few martial arts talents in recent times who sell their goods. Now, Shengchun's artistic ambition is really above the rest. If he can encourage himself, this child has great prospects.</p>
<h3>The Composition of Li Xiangjun</h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>Last night, I went to the Xuan Palace Theater to watch the performance of "Li Xiangjun," written by Mr. Zhou Yibai, which was full of seats and added benches, and the grand occasion was unprecedented.</p>
<p>This play was previously "The Peach Blossom Fan Legend" by Kong Shangren, and the Pingju opera "The Peach Blossom Fan" by Ouyang Yuqian. If adapted according to the original legend, the clues are too many and difficult to deal with. Yibai only selected about ten important characters to appear on stage, which was neither too many nor too few, and achieved the benefit of "saving clues."</p>
<p>Moreover, the structure is also very clear: it is almost entirely based on the relationships among Ruan Dacheng, Li Xiangjun, and Hou Chaozong as the center of the play. The first act writes about Ruan ordering General Wang to present treasures to Hou and Li, but they are rejected. The second act immediately writes about General Wang returning to report, and Ruan summons Xiangjun out of resentment and humiliates her. The third scene writes about Ruan instructing General Wang to force Xiangjun to marry Tian Yang, who refuses, hitting her head against the window and bleeding. Yang Wencong paints a peach blossom fan for her. The fourth act writes about Ruan forcing Xiangjun to enter the palace to perform "Yanzi Jian," when Nanjing is captured by the Qing soldiers, and Xiangjun escapes. The fifth act writes about the final meeting between Xiangjun and Chaozong, who has already left the mountains to take the Qing court exam. Xiangjun cries sadly and dies. Almost from the first act to the fourth act, Ruan Dacheng has always been the opponent of Hou and Li. Although Ruan's beard did not appear in the fifth scene, Liu Jingting pointed out that he had surrendered to the Qing Dynasty and died on Xianxia Ridge without anyone to collect his body. It makes people look with full attention and has a sense of coherence. Even the characters who appeared in the first four acts all borrowed the mouth of Liu Jingting to say their endings in the fifth act. The phrase "everything has been explained" is no different from the self-description of the master. Then, the point of "close needle shuttle" is also done very satisfactorily.</p>
<p>There is also a clever method, which is to borrow paintings to introduce the theme, such as Yu Danxin's poems in the third act and Wu Meicun's words in the fifth act, which are effortless and clever. This method seems to be that historical drama writers have not used it before.</p>
<p>The author is a textual researcher, so most of the events in the play are in line with historical facts. He does not treat Zheng Tuoniang and Yang Wencong as clowns, does not overemphasize Prince Fu, does not treat Ruan Dacheng as a Jing (only makes him a clown, let him say it himself, can sing), and does not regard Chaozong as a man of integrity. These are all places where he is cautious. And because he does not conceal Hou Chaozong's shortcomings, the fifth act is particularly wonderful, becoming a brush that previous families have not reached, which is especially worthy of praise.</p>
