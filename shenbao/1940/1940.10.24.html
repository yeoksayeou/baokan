<h3 id="c8">日閣改組的醞釀 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>昨日路透社與合衆社的東京消息；日本國民新聞於廿二日謂因英美在太平洋合作應付三國同盟，日內閣已有更張必要，近衛將於十一月初史調內閣閣員數名，形成堅强戰時內閣云云。國民新聞是軍部喉舌，現在首先透露改組內閣之說，這應視爲反映着軍部的主張。原來本屆近衛內閣之成立、本出於軍部的運用；而軍部的對外政策，亦爲近衛所全面支持；現在經過僅滿三月，軍部即又發出改組的呼聲，這固然是日本目前內外種種困難使然，同時亦可見日本政治不安的歷史痼疾，並未因近衛的改革運動而獲得好轉。</p>
<p>根據國民新聞的說法，改組政府的目的，乃在於形成堅强戰事內閣，以應付太平洋的緊張局勢，可見在軍部心目中，現閣實屬不夠堅强。分析近衛內閣的本質，是軍閥官僚與小部分財閥的混合體，到最近纔加進了三個政黨人物，以資點綴；論其陣容，固相當孱弱，然而這也正是適應軍部要求；因爲只有這樣，纔便於軍方的頤使。是以此際所謂增强內閣者、其本意絕不像近衛在一九三八年五月改組內閣那樣，援引池田宇垣之類的巨頭；另一方面，軍部的用意，也未必是着眼於那幾個官僚或政黨出身的閣員，因爲彼輩對於軍方企圖並不能形成重大障礙。何况三國締盟的原則當早已確定於近衛組閣之初，並非臨時動議於史塔馬抵達東京以後；則所謂應付三國同盟所引起局勢者，當早已在視閣組成過程中予以考慮，不會等事至今日始形成問題，綜合各方面的觀察，則日本政府內部，此次若果發生裂痕，則此一裂痕絕不存在於枝葉部分，而在其軀幹，其所爭議者亦絕非一般政治見解而爲對於基本國策觀念的歧異。</p>
<p>近衛的新政體制運動本是促進日本舉國一致的一種改革，但在運動進行的初期，就已暴露了近衛與軍部的矛盾；近衛標榜其統帥立法政治於一罏的見解，顯未爲軍方所支持。到大政翼贊會幹部人選決定前後，代表軍部的機關報對於近衛保守妥協傾向的攻擊，竟達到白熱程度，但近衛對此並不十分理會，故於翼贊會的理事人選，鐵拓等三省大臣的補充，都是不顧軍方反對而據爾決定，於是彼此間的裂痕，更見深刻。及至三國同盟締結之後，英美態度突轉堅强，日本未獲締盟之利，反而因此遭遇了空前的重大難關；這一形勢，無疑更影響到日本內部見解的紛歧；軍部及右翼分子則凌厲叫囂，保守階層則惴惴危懼，近衛松岡雖然手訂盟的而他們的態度却不盡與軍方相一致。允其是向以親軍右傾知名的松岡，其近半月來所發言論，顯與邇來反映軍部見解的輿論判若兩途；他的外交運用與使領陣容的史迭，以及經外省發言人須磨和最近駐智大使石井發表的談話，都是脫不了霞關外交的一貫窼臼，言與白鳥敏夫大島浩一之流所號召的革新外交大相逕庭。固然，這都可以算做是對外的姿態，並非眞正軟化，且在近衛松岡與軍部及極端份子之間並沒有本質上的差異；但他們　在攻勢的內外政策之中，具有較多的妥協成分，而且不時反映着所謂保守陣營的見解；這種情形，當非軍方所能長久容忍。</p>
<p>在最近半月之中，軍方對於現閣對外政策的溫和面目並未直接多加指摘，那並不是默契，而是期待着正在進行中的對法越荷印經濟談判的成功；那些談判固不足以抵銷英美的巨大壓力，但却與對蘇談判同是日方在目前所唯一値得自慰的。如果此等談判不能再有確切的收穫，則日本必須重新考慮其內外政策，並於澈底冒險與改絃更張之間加以最後的選擇。於是可以窺見所謂小林由荷印被召回一事與內閣更迭有關的原因。最近日方對荷印談判的進行並不十分順利，無形中自更增加了日本政局的不安。</p>
<p>國民新聞曾警吿日本國民說：「遠東形勢漸趨嚴重，爲達到目標及保持尊嚴起見，應作充分準備，俾在與英作戰或成、立和平二途中任擇一途」；就軍部立塲說，其所選擇的將小外於擴大作戰，但這却未必是最大多數日本人民的共同觀感。假如前面的分析與事實不大相遠，則軍部所昌言改組內閣者，其主要用意即在淸算近衛松岡政策中的保守和妥協趨勢，而使日本形成更適合於對外作戰的政治機構；此其前途究將如何演變，尙非目前所驟能斷定，但關於近衛是否終將徇軍部之請而改組內閣，以及如何改組，對此試作靜觀，則大致不難窺見日本此後的動向。</p>

<h3 id="c50">歐戰叢談（廿二）　溫莎公的新職 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>溫莎公現年四十六歲，他的外表實在比他的年齡爲輕。尤其在若干距離之外看他，覺得他格外年輕。他自己說：「我不老，也不少一，這句話一些也不錯。他兩眼從前胖胖的，有人引以為笑談之資料，現在已經兩樣了。在他暢談或喜笑的時候，眼角上的皺紋都呈露了出來，若有人說他還是個孩子」，那眞是笑話了。</p>
<p>同時，他輕快矯健的步履，濃而有光澤的頭髮，每當一陣微風吹來，便在眉毛上面輕拂的飄散着：他的熱情，不拘禮節，都使他表示很年輕，看上去只不過四十一二歲罷了。</p>
<p>溫莎公還有運動家的本色。在「索茂士夫人」號開船後五分鐘，他便把領帶解除，在甲板上時，身上總是穿着短袖奶油色或淡黃色的運動衫，藍色短褲，頭頸裹有時又繫上一塊印花手帕，足登藍色軟底鞋。這鞋子他在哈密爾頓時以十三先令（合美金二元六角）購得，偶爾赤着脚就穿鞋子。他的臂膊雖不壯碩，但尙勻稱，在臂灣以下的一段，被太陽晒得很黑：當他不穿襪子的時候，又可看見襪統足踝爲止，光緻緻的十分潔白。</p>
<p>這位遜王說話旣快，而又頗用力，很不容易聽懂。與人談話的時候，她稱他爲「公爵」，他則稱她爲「公爵夫人」，很爲荘重。但在新聞記者及攝影員前，溫莎公屢次呼他的夫人爲「心上人一，態度十分自然。她呢，在人面前倒沒有如此的喊過她丈夫。夫婦倆笑起來都毫無拘束，溫莎公的笑聲呵—呵—呵—地，十足表示他胸無城府。她笑時遲緩而自然，一雙蔚藍的眼睛，非常嫵媚動人一溫莎公對於人家的名字及面貌記憶力極强，妙用無窮。當他身居大寳時，曾經無其數的檢閱海陸軍隊，而且照例在檢閱行伍時，總要立停着與受檢閱的隨意問答幾句。在招待人數衆多的新聞記者，他對每個人總有幾句比較體貼的話，使得聽者頗爲動容。譬如他見到紐約泰晤士報訊者時，便問起那位費立普氏。他一向担任紐約泰晤士報駐巴黎通訊員，曾採訪關於愛德華遜位和結婚的新聞。溫莎公爵夫人在這一點上及不到她的丈夫，見到客人時，總是用手帕抿看嘴，含笑說：「你好呀」而已。</p>
<p>溫莎公旣抽板烟，又吃紙烟——往往剛抽罷板烟，接着就吸紙烟。他夫人和他開玩笑，摹仿他燃烟斗時各種不同姿勢。她說，她已紀起了四種式樣呢。</p>
<p>公爵夫人最講究穿着。他在服飾方面，刻意用心，一絲不苟。最近因夫婦倆從法國買舟渡海，頗非易易，身上所穿的衣服，已沒有從前那樣漂亮了。她在哈密爾頓上岸時，和抵達巴哈馬時所穿的是同樣的一套衣服。要是在往日，那是決不會如此的。那套衣服，上衫是粉紅與藍色，外套作淡藍色。鑲珠的「朱麗亞」式帽子，帽　在前。在船上時，她常穿印花綢衫，外罩藍衣，加以黃色的裝飾，這黃色是他們夫婦倆心愛的顔色。</p>
<p>公爵夫人望之如三十六七許人，講話徐緩，帶着英國和美國南部口音。在大體上，她對於一切政治都不信任，可是對於美國十一月大選，倒很發生興趣。她和公爵都笑說威爾基（美國共和黨候選總統）的照片從來沒有看見兩足着地的，這就是說他夫婦倆所看見威爾基的照片，都是兩足擱置在寫字台上的。</p>
<p>他們對於攝影都愛好彌殷，他們自己原是人家攝影的最好目標。溫莎公在船上　整化上了二十分鐘時間，察看攝影記者杜旁德處置一切。最後，夫婦倆決意到達拿沙之後，要在總督公署佈置一間攝影暗房</p>
<p>凡曾見過溫莎公爵夫婦倆眞面目的，都知道在許多新聞片中，他們的照片實在一些也不像，尤其是他們倆結婚時候所攝取的。公爵夫人甚至坦白地說，她右頰上面本有一粒痣，可是一經粗心地攝入鏡頭，在幾張新聞片中，實然難看之至了。她的意思是說，她本人或溫莎公固不欲在銀幕上「出風頭」，像電影明星一般，但是從另一方面講，他們也有權可以不叫人把他們的難看情狀攝入鏡頭。因之，她看見船上的攝影員對光度，量角度等種種手續，很表示滿意。這樣至少可使面上瑕疵維持原狀，不至變本加厲，使整個面部大受其累。</p>
<p>溫莎公爵夫婦倆在船上和我們記者非正式談話，所涉的方面頗多，談風甚健。他們對於軍事新聞的各種檢查方式，美國報紙與出版商的政治連繫，倫敦泰晤士報的管理方面，英大主敎是否亦參與其間的問題，美國食物，汽車等等，無所不談。溫莎公和人談話時，常常迥首向着他的夫人，好像說：「你怎樣意思？溫莎公與公爵夫人情好靡篤，常在不知不覺之間露出來。</p>
<p>溫莎公和他的夫人對於他們的三條小獵犬，疼愛之至，他倆走到那裏，這三條犬常常跟到那裏。公爵因爲愛好它們呼之爲「主子」，而他的副官委實有些討厭它們，斥之爲「匪待」。</p>
<p>溫莎公身長五呎六吋，全身非常相稱，據他的裁縫所報告的尺寸爲胸圍三十六吋，腰二十九吋，臀部三十六吋，褲二十九吋。公爵夫人較他身材略矮，苗條多姿，兩人站在一起，不愧一對玉人。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c92">英國戰時之統制貿易 <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— 英君</p>
<p>英國自戰事發生以後，對於進出口貿易，均訂有限制辦法，並爲發展國外貿易起見，復有信用保證辦法，藉以鞏固戰時之外滙基金，査英國平時收入之大部份，向來得自製造與貿易，在戰時維持此項收入，實爲最關重要之事，惟歐陸若干市塲，淪落於德國之手，英國旣無法獲得必需之貨物，頗受相當損失，故戰事爆發以後，英政府曾公佈一貨物名單，所列之貨物，概禁由英國本邦輸出，當時曾引起不少誤會，蓋一般人認爲所列貨物將絕對禁止出口也，但以後事實表示，仍可在相當條件下得自由出口，不過須領許可證耳。此蓋爲預防戰事物品缺乏，因在戰時，常有本星期內某種貨物儲蓄量原甚充足，一至下星期，忽感不足，不得不有相當節制也。</p>
<p>英國政府了解維持輸出貿易之重要，特組織一輸出聯合會，以圖在戰時條件之下，儘量發展輸出貿易。爲求輸出貿易之完滿，故輸出聯合會又集合許多工業家，組成一輸出集團，並成立委員會，每一工業之原料，價格，分配，與市塲等特殊問題，均可提交此種委員會，求取完滿之解答。各工業自成立此種聯合會以後，凡關於爲應付定貨而獲取輸出口必需原料，及關於確定輸出價格之事，均有良好一致之辦法，此外各工廠之請求輸出認可手續，藉此團體之幫助，亦容易辦理，而輸出品製造業較國內消費品製造業，亦可取得比較有利之地位。英政府並爲扶助本邦製造業而發展輸出貿易計，訂有保用鐵證辦法，業已普遍實行，其辦法爲英國售主與國外正當顧客所成立之買賣契的，因受阻而無法完成時，或者如果顧客不付貨價時，則政府擔保賠償售主之一切損失，至於關於外國貨物在戰時輸入英國，則限制甚嚴，除英政府認爲係必需的或歡迎的貨物以外，任何種類外國貨物之輸入，皆在嚴厲限制之列，凡欲輸入者，無論何時，均需先獲得致府當局之允許，蓋外國貨物之輸入，必需以外滙結價，而外滙則爲戰時一寳貴之物，且需用以購買戰時基本必需品；同時海運艙位，僅作運輸重要物品之用，如允許一般外國貨物自由輸入，則此有用之艙位將被佔用，有碍戰事也。</p>

<h3 id="c107">蝸居粗綫條 <a href="#c107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— 東林</p>
<p>蝸牛生在蝸殼裹面，長在蝸殼裏面，也死在蝸殼裹面。在生，長，死的選程，牠也許從不領悟蝸殼外面的天地，因爲牠自有天地，自有生存的空間。你能把牠劃到生物界以外去嗎？牠和雞長類的人們一樣地生，長，死。不過所佔的空間大小不同而已。</p>
<p>由於這個近乎怪誕的想頭，我稍稍得到一點安慰，因爲我正住在蝸殼裹面，生活和蝸牛差不多。在外邊看到那些巍峨大厦，洋樓別莊，自己有時也不免相形之下，一陣懊惱，但一想到蝸牛，我釋然了，蝸牛活得下去，難道我活不下去？</p>
<p>我現在並不想寫『蝸殼遊記』，或『蝸殼生活報吿』之類，原因是高貴的人們必是信仰進化論的，對於這倒退九萬八千年的蝸殼生活一定不感興趣，更談不到乘興一遊了。所以我只書根粗綫條，一面聊當自娛，一面自然也可作爲別的蝸牛們彼此參照之用。</p>
<p>爲了避免高等的老爺們難堪的白眼，和過於不登大雅，有傷體面（不，高貴的眼睛）起見，我看還是改用蝸居罷。換上一個「居」字，應該雅緻點了。有許多洋樓別莊的前面，不也題着什麼什麽「居」嗎？我並不是阿Q，可是我寗願做一决阿Q，好在是一决，下不爲例，無妨的。</p>
<p>我的紙墨和筆硯早買好了，準備用曹全碑的體例寫兩個大大的『蝸居』懸在鬥上，可是終日忙着餬口，一直沒有寫好懸上去，所以門前是一個空白。至於門裹是一個不等邊畸狀的平行四邊形立方框子，從左邊向右邊大的有一大步又四分之一之遙，從門檻向後壁的有一大步又六分之一的模樣。這後壁因爲缺少幾寸地的原故，大房東不得不把它造成斜的，以免觸犯『侵佔』的條律，因此我的蝸居成爲不等邊（也可說强，箱子塞在床頭僅僅剛够的空子裏，兩隻藍子睡在布床下，一堆書擠在牆上自釘的木板書架上，板架下就放着我的書檯和椅子，對窗略偏一點。</p>
<p>白天的蝸居就是這樣，我進門妻要坐到椅子裏，等我坐到布床上之後，妻再出去；妻進來，我也如樣辦理。小蝸牛呢？除放在床上坐着或睡倒以外，就是抱到弄堂裹去。如果三頭蝸牛同在『居』裏，小蝸牛蜷在床上，我與妻分坐椅上與桌邊。三頭蝸牛一動，不是你的頭碰着他的胸，就是他的手不等角）的四邊形方框框了。這是蝸居四周的大概，至於脚下倒是上好的赭紅色地板，頭上是別人的地板，我的膀子如再長一尺就舉手可攀了。</p>
<p>我有兩個布床，一口箱子，兩隻籃子，一隻寫字檯，一個椅子，大堆書。　我是雄蝸牛，妻是雌蝸牛，還有一個小蝸牛。計蝸牛大小三頭。</p>
<p>後壁斜擺着一隻布床（沿着床），巳佔去蝸居三分之一觸到你的膀子。</p>
<p>夜晚妻和小蝸牛陲在後壁這張床上，我睡在那裏呢？地板上必定要將頭或脚伸到桌子下面，有點悶氣，張布床椅子碍事，左想右想，把後壁釘上一根釘，掛上椅子去，於是椅子脚拖下來離開妻與小蝸牛的床一尺多遠，妻坐起時頭常常碰着椅脚·但是椅子讓出的空間已經够我再張一個布床了。張布床之先必將蝸牛居門緊閉，因爲那布床耍橫在門的背上，這時我的床與妻的床之間只容一條腿的空隙，可以拿便壺或者站着摺床張床·所以當我睡下去的時候，蝸居十足構成了，因爲滿屋除兩床之間的一條細縫，我的頭抵着桌子，脚踏墻壁，妻頭頂箱子，脚也踏着墻壁，上面掛着椅子和墻壁書架，如果空氣當中也能安置一點東西的話，我不但十足是蝸居主人，恐怕還要是『節的空間』的發明家呢。</p>
<p>蝸居門的啟閉，完全以我的起臥爲準，所以朋友們在早晨和晚間到我道裹來，總是無門可入。</p>
<p>就這樣掛椅子摺床張床居然也度過一年。和那些高樓大厦，洋樓別莊裏的人們同樣度過了一年。由於這種蝸居的習慣，我也許有點蝸牛化起來了，我覺得人們浪費空間，佔去別人的空聞是個不可饒恕的罪惡。</p>
<p>我不知道希特勒莫案里尼輩嘴裏的『生存空間』和我這個生存空間有無不同，但我堅決相信，浪費空間的人一定也是侵略別人空間的人。我以爲不管侵佔者怎樣貪得無饜，能生存者，總是有它應有的空間的，侵佔者固然不會把所有的空間全部佔有，被侵佔者也始終不會無活命的立椎之地，正與蝸牛和我始終生存在這世界上一樣。至於我的天地和蝸牛的夭地唯一不同的地方，就是我堅決地確信，空間本來不是任何東西可得私有，將來必然的有一天，——空間仍舊公有。不過到那時候，是屬於我與蝸牛的子孫世界了。我欣喜的遙望着，憧憬着。</p>

<p>— 陳佩英</p>
<p>已婚女子的參加社會工作，最大的難題，就是自已的丈夫能不能合作，帮助和鼓勵。如果我們去參加了社會工作，工作完竣，他們不能安守在家庭裏，出去爲非作惡，我們寗願終身伏在廚房裏，而且要丈夫們同負或帮助家內工作之責。現在我來報吿我半社會半家庭的工作情形。也可說是過渡時代的過渡生活。</p>
<p>我是某女中的商科畢業生，巳結婚了好多年，丈夫是一個洋行職員，也是業餘畫家。我們有一個女孩子，她現在小學唸書，早上我和他合作家事，有時他畫事很忙，就由我一人負責。八時後我們三人把門鎖好同時出發，各到自己的辦公處，敎室。午後半時大家歸來吃午飯，午飯是母親代燒的，下午五時後我們睦續回家，丈夫總是最先到家，他回家時，帶買小菜，以備晚膳之大嚼，我們的早午飯都很隨便，祗有晚飯才考究些。我們很快樂地分工合作，洗菜呀，淘米呀，洗盌呀！忙得不亦樂乎。但是如果他很忙，則他不參加廚房工作，不過很例外的，這種生活，雖然使我們極忙碌，但是精神上很快活。</p>
<p>總之已婚女子的參加社會工作，必需要丈夫的合作。我自己的能耐勞吃苦，還耍有一個可靠的人，看守門戶，以及應付其他雜務，吾則是畫餅而已。</p>

<p>第十章　皮鞋問題</p>
<p>當我叫金梅說出關於李守琦的事實的時候，金梅還有一種小小的曲折的表演。伊走到書桌面前，彎着腰用手把那鏤孔的窗帘輕輕拉起了一角，向外面探望了一下，好像這番說話非常秘密，恐防李芝範會回來，被他聽見了，會鬧出事來。接着伊回到圓桌旁來，臉上也顯着小心戒備的神氣。我用手向那另一隻皮墊椅指了一指，伊就慢慢地坐下。</p>
<p>伊低聲說道：「先生，這個李少爺的確有些可疑，不過我實在不敢說。現在王小姐死了，李老爺好像是這裏的主人，他如果知道我說他兒子的事，那我一定吃不消。先生，這事關係太大了。你如果不能保證我，我還是不敢說。」</p>
<p>我立卽答道：「你放心，儘管說，祇要你的話完全實在，什麽人都不能難爲你。你說，道李守琦有過什麽一回事？」</p>
<p>金梅的目光注視着我，頓了一頓，突然說道：「他要強姦王小姐！」伊說了這句，急忙把目光避開，移到窗口邊去，好像非常驚恐。</p>
<p>這句話當然不能不使我感到驚異，但我仍保持着鎮靜的常態。我同答說：「你別怕，就是李芝範回來，也沒有關係。你說得仔細些。他是十七那天來的，來了以後怎麽樣？」</p>
<p>金梅定了定神，才說：「他一到這裏，王小姐瞧見了他，大家臉上都不好看，他吃過了中飯，王小姐就跟他在這裏談話，談話的聲音很低，時間又很長久，我曾送茶進來，王小姐立刻叫我出去，把門也鎖上了。所以他們談些什麼，我完全聽小見。後來那姓趙的來了，王小姐忙趕出去阻擋他，不讓姓趙的進來。</p>
<p>「他們談了足足兩個鐘頭，大家的喉嚨響起來了，幸虧李老爺敲門進來，給他們勸解。李老爺也加入談話，又談了好一回，王小姐才氣冲冲開了門回樓上去。這一回總算不曾鬧成功。」　（一四五）</p>

<p>將再攝「蝗蟲於螞蟻」</p>
<p>自從華德狄斯耐的「白雪公主」介紹到我國以後，一般愛好卡通影片的觀衆，無疑的，更進一步的表示深切的好感了。眞的，如果認爲電影可以敎育社會的話，那麽，卡通影片在這方面確具很大的效力，允其是一般婦孺階級中間。</p>
<p>我國，則因器械的不够，對於卡通影片很少注意的，所以萬氏（籟鳴古蟾）兄弟努力在卡通工作上十多年，還是吸引不到一般人士的興趣。直到本年新春，國聯影業公司設立卡通部，當局久仰他們大名，於是加以聘請，主持進行的方針。因此，中國第一部長篇卡通「鐵扇公主」，就在他們計劃下，開始攝製了。</p>
<p>現在，已經工作四個多月，差不多大體上是成功的了，大的冉經二個月的配音剪輯種種必要的過程，就可開始貢默在觀衆眼前。當然，一定會受萬千人士的在熱的擁護。</p>
<p>在「鐵扇公主」中，雖然題目似乎含有神怪的成份，其實內容是非常針對着大時代的，說明光明的追求前，該要經過千辛萬苦的。因此，在第二部影片中，主題上更要大量豐富了。現在，暫定片名「蝗蟲與螞蟻」，包括宇宙間一切動物生存的動態，但所認爲問題者，就是如何參入時代的意義了</p>

<p>十月，是被人稱爲史劇季的。所以劇藝社在「大明央烈傳」後預定公演去年的偉大作品「明末遺恨」，陣容方面是相當的堅强，其中，因爲劉瓊的鄭成功，曾經在去年的演出上，使人感到深刻的印象，所以該社仍舊歡迎看他的參加。固然，他在以藝術作前提的條件下，並不因爲已經演過」星期的「海國英雄」感到疲乏，反非常興奮的毅然擔任該角的演出了。是的「明末遺恨」軍演後，整個劇壇又將轟動一時的。</p>

<p>New York – Secretary of the Navy Knox declared today that Americans will continue to aid Britain and China, and that Americans will accumulate weapons and will not appease anyone. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Washington – The United States Navy is now urgently preparing everything in the Pacific Ocean to be able to take action in times of emergency. Coincidentally, the authorities recently announced that two powerful U.S. Navy fleets will be established in the Far East, with the principle of being able to operate independently in that area. The Navy Department announced last night that it has requisitioned five merchant ships from the Panama Pacific Line, each with a displacement of 8,378 tons. It is widely believed that these ships will be assigned as transport vessels to carry reinforcements to Hawaii, and will later be converted into aircraft carriers. The government has also requisitioned the giant ship "President Roosevelt," with a displacement of 13,869 tons. The ship’s route from New York to Bermuda will be immediately suspended. According to officials in Washington, the government may purchase the "President Roosevelt," but this matter is still in progress and has not reached a final decision. Officials also refused to announce the Navy Department's intentions for the "President Roosevelt," but it is widely believed that the ship will be sent to the Pacific. The government's requisition of additional auxiliary ships coincides with the urgent reinforcement of troops in Hawaii. According to reliable sources in naval circles, the authorities may reorganize the country's fleet in the Pacific and establish two large fleets in the Far East capable of fighting independently. It is also understood that this plan has been under consideration by the authorities here for several months. It is believed that this plan will be expedited due to Japan's joining the German-Italian axis. It is said that although this plan will not be implemented until the garrison in Hawaii has been fully strengthened, the time for its implementation is not far off. It is said that this plan is intended to establish another Asian fleet in the southern part of the Far East, in opposition to the patrol fleets of the Yangtze River and North China. It is understood that this southern fleet will be equipped with all patrol military equipment, using Manila as its base, for reconnaissance and patrol purposes. It is also believed that the Singapore naval base may also be adopted at any time. (United Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>Washington – An editorial in the Washington News commented on the changes in American public opinion over the past few months, saying that a year ago, anyone who said that the United States would join the war would have been ridiculed, but today, the whole country is talking about the United States at war. The biggest event in the world today is that the United States is now on the edge of the war, and if this trend is not curbed, the United States will inevitably join the war. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt has ordered that private factories should give priority to manufacturing all items needed for national defense. This is the first time in American history that the government has controlled private industry in peacetime. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt established a new committee last night, organized with four people. The chairman is Nelson, and the other members are Knudsen, Director General of Armaments Production, Stettinius, and Henderson. All three are members of the National Defense Council. It is heard that the main task of this new committee is to examine whether American industrial organizations are giving priority to manufacturing the goods ordered by the government for military equipment.

<p>New York – The New York Tribune Assembly Hall opened today. Secretary of the Navy Knox attended the opening ceremony and delivered a speech, stating that in the near future, the United States will obtain more naval bases in the Pacific. When discussing the progress of the United States' rearmament, he said that the United States needs more naval bases in the Pacific, and said, "The United States will obtain these bases." He also said that the location of the bases in the Pacific will depend on the evolution of the situation. At present, the United States has the most powerful fleet, its speed, armament, combat effectiveness, and form are unmatched. Once an order is received, the entire fleet can be deployed to various key points to control sea routes. However, this defense strategy may not be strong enough. The United States has waited too long to strengthen its navy. The United States did not recognize early enough how important the navy is to the security of the United States. There is no excuse for this. Now, because the United States may have to fight the totalitarian countries alone, the United States has been awakened." He also said that the speed of shipbuilding has exceeded the planned schedule. Undersecretary of the Army Patterson also attended the ceremony. He warned the American people that the United States is not yet able to defend its country on land, and that it will take a year and a half before the United States can enter the battlefield with "an army sufficient to deal with any provocation." He continued, "The world situation is very critical. I have never shaken my command. It must be known that the question is not whether the United States will participate in the war. Many countries overseas that did not want the war to come have already been plunged into war. Therefore, the war may extend to the United States." (International Telegraph, 23rd)</p>
<p>New York – Undersecretary of the Army Petersen yesterday warned the American people not to be impatient with the progress of armaments, and said that the military equipment that can be delivered and used next March may not be much more than today, but by next September, the situation will be much better. At that time, we can maintain the deployment of basic troops in the battlefield with the best military equipment that the world can produce. By March 1942, we should be able to cope with any challenge. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>

<p>Mexico City – According to reliable sources here yesterday, Mexico will not sell scrap iron to any totalitarian country, even if Japan offers a high price. It is heard that the Mexican government may sell 19,000 tons of scrap iron to Britain. Reliable sources said that the government has also decided to cancel the oil concession that allowed a certain Japanese company to conduct development work in a million acres of land in Veracruz Province. However, it is not yet known whether this concession has actually been cancelled. (United Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>Washington – Secretary of State Hull yesterday refused to comment on reports that Mexico had decided to cancel Japan's gasoline contract in Veracruz Province.

<p>Newspaper Threatens Dutch East Indies; Actually Advocates Use of Force</p>
<p>Tokyo – Japanese newspapers today warned the Dutch East Indies that unless the Dutch East Indies authorities accept Japan's economic demands, Japan may take military action to achieve its goals. The Asahi Shimbun, the most influential newspaper here, said that in order to make the East Indies join the Japanese side, "We should choose one of the following two paths: either clearly declare to them that relying on the United States is useless, or simply use force to make them submit." The newspaper severely attacked the Dutch East Indies' "traditional policy of relying on Britain and the United States." It is said that Japan recalled Chief Kobayashi of the delegation to listen to his detailed report. The newspaper also said that normally, Kobayashi should not have been summoned back before completing his mission. Therefore, his sudden return to Japan indicates that Japan's basic policy towards the Dutch East Indies has changed. The Asahi Shimbun and Yomiuri Shimbun commented on this matter, saying that Britain's "monopoly" in the Dutch East Indies is another clear evidence of Britain's repeated undermining of U.S.-Japan relations. The Yomiuri Shimbun said, "Britain's recent series of unfriendly actions towards Japan, such as reopening the Burma Road and arresting Japanese residents in Singapore, have deeply angered Japanese officials and non-officials." The newspaper continued, "It is inevitable that Japan should adopt a stronger line against Britain." The Yomiuri Shimbun also said that although the gasoline negotiations currently being held between Japan and the Dutch East Indies authorities are "very smooth," Japan must still pay attention to the sabotage of Britain and the United States. (United Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Suma, a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry, today denied that Japan had reached a gasoline agreement with the Dutch East Indies. Suma said that the government's recall of Kobayashi, the chief of the delegation to the Dutch East Indies, was unrelated to the negotiations in Batavia. Suma also refused to comment on Japanese newspaper reports that Britain and the United States were currently placing "various obstacles" in the way of the Batavia negotiations.

<p>British Ships Dutch East Indies Oil; Sufficient to Embarrass Japan</p>
<p>Washington – Experts here now believe that Britain's large-scale purchase of oil from the Dutch East Indies may put Japan's war in China in a difficult position. Japan, in view of the U.S. restrictions on the export of certain oils, will have a special feeling about Britain's purchase of oil. According to expert estimates, Japan consumed nearly 25.5 million barrels of various gasoline and kerosene last year. Experts believe that although there is no reliable information about Japan's indirect acquisition of oil from various places, it is believed that a large amount of oil transported from the Dutch East Indies to Singapore, Malacca, and some small islands near the Straits Settlements must have been transshipped to Japan. These islands were the largest importers of oil produced by the Dutch East Indies last year, amounting to nearly one million barrels. In the first nine months of last year, Japan directly purchased 1,336,000 barrels of oil from the Dutch East Indies. (United Press, 23rd)</p>

<h3 id="e8">The Brewing of the Japanese Cabinet Reorganization <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Tokyo news from Reuters and United Press; The Japanese Kokumin Shimbun stated on the 22nd that because Britain and the United States are cooperating in the Pacific to deal with the Tripartite Pact, it is necessary to reorganize the Japanese cabinet. Konoe will transfer several cabinet members in early November to form a strong wartime cabinet. Kokumin Shimbun is the mouthpiece of the military. Now it is the first to reveal the saying of reorganizing the cabinet, which should be regarded as reflecting the military's proposition. Originally, the establishment of the current Konoe Cabinet was based on the military's operation; and the military's foreign policy was also fully supported by Konoe; now, after only three months, the military has issued the call for reorganization again, which is of course due to the various internal and external difficulties in Japan at present, and at the same time, it can be seen that the historical chronic disease of political instability in Japan has not been improved by Konoe's reform movement.</p>
<p>According to Kokumin Shimbun, the purpose of reorganizing the government is to form a strong wartime cabinet to cope with the tense situation in the Pacific, which shows that in the eyes of the military, the current cabinet is not strong enough. Analyzing the essence of the Konoe Cabinet, it is a mixture of military cliques, bureaucrats, and a small part of the financial clique, and recently added three political party figures for decoration; judging from its lineup, it is quite weak, but this is precisely to adapt to the military's requirements; because only in this way is it convenient for the military to boss around. Therefore, the so-called strengthening the cabinet at this time, its original intention is definitely not like Konoe's reorganization of the cabinet in May 1938, citing giants such as Ikeda and Ugaki; on the other hand, the military's intention is not necessarily focused on those cabinet members who came from bureaucrats or political parties, because they cannot form a major obstacle to the military's attempts. Moreover, the principle of the Tripartite Pact should have been determined at the beginning of Konoe's cabinet formation, and was not a temporary motion after Stahmer arrived in Tokyo; then the so-called situation caused by the Tripartite Pact should have been considered in the process of cabinet formation, and it will not wait until today to form a problem. Comprehensive observations from all aspects show that if there is a crack in the Japanese government this time, this crack does not exist in the branches and leaves, but in its trunk, and what is debated is not general political views but the difference in the concept of basic national policy.</p>
<p>Konoe's New Order Movement was originally a reform to promote Japan's national unity, but in the early stage of the movement, the contradiction between Konoe and the military was exposed; Konoe flaunted his view of unifying the supreme command of legislation and politics, which was obviously not supported by the military. Around the time when the cadre candidates of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association were decided, the military's mouthpiece newspaper's attack on Konoe's conservative compromise tendency reached a fever pitch, but Konoe did not pay much attention to this, so in the selection of the directors of the Assistance Association and the supplement of the ministers of the three provinces of Takushoku, he made the decision regardless of the military's opposition, and thus the crack between them became more profound. After the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact, the attitude of Britain and the United States suddenly turned strong, and Japan did not receive the benefit of the alliance, but instead encountered unprecedented major difficulties; this situation undoubtedly further affected the differences in opinions within Japan; the military and right-wing elements clamored sharply, while the conservative class was apprehensive, and although Konoe and Matsuoka personally signed the alliance, their attitudes were not entirely consistent with the military. Even Matsuoka, who was known for being pro-military and right-leaning, his statements in the past half month were obviously different from the public opinion reflecting the military's views in recent times; his diplomatic operations and the reshuffle of the diplomatic corps, as well as the statements made by the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Suma, and the recent ambassador to Chile, Ishii, were all inseparable from the consistent old habits of Kasumigaseki diplomacy, and the words were very different from the innovative diplomacy advocated by Shiro Tori and Hiroshi Oshima. Of course, these can all be regarded as external postures, not real softening, and there is no essential difference between Konoe, Matsuoka and the military and extreme elements; but they have more compromising elements in their aggressive internal and external policies, and from time to time reflect the views of the so-called conservative camp; this situation cannot be tolerated by the military for a long time.</p>
<p>In the past half month, the military has not directly criticized the moderate face of the current cabinet's foreign policy, which is not a tacit understanding, but an expectation of the success of the ongoing economic negotiations with French Indochina and the Dutch East Indies; those negotiations are not enough to offset the huge pressure from Britain and the United States, but are the only things that the Japanese side can take comfort in at present, along with the negotiations with the Soviet Union. If these negotiations cannot have any definite gains, Japan must reconsider its internal and external policies and make a final choice between thorough adventure and a change of course. Thus, it can be seen that the reason why the so-called recall of Kobayashi from the Dutch East Indies is related to the change of the cabinet. Recently, the progress of the Japanese negotiations with the Dutch East Indies has not been very smooth, which has invisibly increased the political instability in Japan.</p>
<p>Kokumin Shimbun once warned the Japanese people: "The situation in the Far East is gradually becoming serious. In order to achieve the goal and maintain dignity, we should make full preparations so that we can choose one of the two paths of fighting or making peace with Britain"; from the military's point of view, what it chooses will be nothing more than expanding the war, but this is not necessarily the common view of the vast majority of Japanese people. If the above analysis is not far from the facts, then the military's advocacy of reorganizing the cabinet is mainly to liquidate the conservative and compromising trends in the policies of Konoe and Matsuoka, and to make Japan form a political organization that is more suitable for foreign war; it is not possible to predict at present how this prospect will evolve, but it is not difficult to see Japan's future trends by observing whether Konoe will eventually comply with the military's request and reorganize the cabinet, and how to reorganize it.</p>

<p>Chongqing: Today's Ta Kung Pao carried an editorial advocating for changes in China's diplomatic lineup, proposing: (1) the complete abolishment of embassies in all Nordic countries, including those in Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Belgium; (2) the abolishment of embassies in Cuba and Panama, with their duties to be concurrently managed by the embassy in Mexico, and the abolishment of embassies in Peru and Chile, with their duties concurrently managed by the embassy in Brazil; (3) the funds saved should be used to establish new embassies in Australia and Central Asia; (4) the appointment of roving ambassadors without fixed posts. The newspaper also advocated for abolishing the embassy in Vichy and replacing it with a minister, as well as abolishing the commission to the League of Nations. It suggested appointing Wellington Koo as a roving ambassador to oversee China's interests in Europe. Regarding Siam and the Nanyang region, it proposed establishing a roving minister, and the same for Egypt, Africa, and the Near East. Foreign diplomatic representatives should be summoned back to the country periodically to gain insight into the recent situation of the nation. Furthermore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs itself should be reorganized to strengthen the intelligence department. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Today's Ta Kung Pao published an article strongly advocating for the reorganization of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the adjustment of diplomatic envoys, and the enhancement of diplomatic effectiveness. In the strongly worded article, the newspaper forcefully argued that the "alarming" expenses of foreign embassies should be abolished. It stated that the European War had caused many changes and that many foreign embassies were no longer needed. Therefore, the dispatch of representatives in the future should be determined by the current situation in order to adapt to the Pacific region, which requires more attention from China. As for Germany, it has now formed the Tripartite Pact, which is tantamount to abandoning China and befriending Japan, assisting its invasion of China. Therefore, the German issue should also be given serious consideration. The newspaper further questioned the necessity of China dispatching an ambassador to Germany and advocated for reducing the staff of the embassy in France, with the current ambassador to France, the highly skilled diplomat Dr. Wellington Koo, concurrently serving as ambassador to various European countries. The newspaper also advocated for recalling envoys to countries occupied by Germany, such as Poland and Norway. As for the newspaper's advocacy for the internal reorganization of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, its main reason was that personnel in the General Affairs Department and the Intelligence Department were ineffective and emphasized personal relationships rather than talent.

<p>Japanese Planes Bomb Bridge, but Fail to Hit Target</p>
<p>Rangoon: Official circles here announced last night that Japan's plan to destroy the bridge over the Mekong River near Dali to cut off the Yunnan-Burma Road has failed. According to news from Dali, the first batch of sixty Chinese transport vehicles safely crossed the bridge yesterday en route to Chongqing.

<p>Clermont-Ferrand: The famous political commentator Gana Vallejo recently published an article in "Paris Soir" stating that the government will soon grant customs autonomy to Vietnam to freely adjust its business relations with Japan. The French delegation will go to Tokyo in a short period of time, and at least two important officials will be among them. The Japanese economic delegation has already arrived in Hanoi and will collect various information to prepare for the negotiation of economic agreements and immediately establish a purchase method with the Vietnamese authorities to purchase rice and rubber. They will also determine the supply methods for the Japanese troops stationed in Tonkin. France also hopes that Vietnam can reach an agreement with Japan, so it has decided to grant customs autonomy to Vietnam so that it can grant preferential import tariffs to certain Japanese goods under substantial exchange conditions. Considering the economic position of Vietnam, it should agree. On the other hand, if Vietnam still belongs to the same customs group as France, then the French headquarters must also reduce tariffs on Japanese goods. If so, Japanese goods will inevitably flood the French market, which is not beneficial to the French economy. (Havas, 22nd)</p>

<p>Hankou: The rice shortage in Hankou is becoming increasingly severe. If the current situation does not change drastically this winter or no one organizes disaster relief, it is feared that there will be widespread starvation. It is heard that in rice-producing areas, the price of rice is only 10 yuan per dan, which is the price at which the Japanese army purchases it. Although the price of rice here is reported to be 40 yuan per shi, it can only be purchased for 60 yuan. The high price of rice is reportedly due to heavy taxes along the way and the fact that rice merchants must pay a large fee to obtain a pass to transport rice here. Another reason is hoarding by the rich and manipulation by unscrupulous merchants. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>

<p>Chongqing: On the 23rd, a reporter visited Gu Yiqun, the newly appointed acting general manager of the Chinese Farmers Bank, and inquired about wartime agricultural finance measures. He replied that he was hired by the board of directors of the Chinese Farmers Bank as an assistant manager, and since General Manager Ye Zuotang is recuperating in Hong Kong and unable to personally attend to matters, he is concurrently serving as the acting general manager. Regarding China's agricultural finance policy, it has been determined and implemented by the central government and has been quite effective. He will follow the instructions of Chairman Kong and closely coordinate with the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications and related agencies, and supervise all staff members to carry out spiritual mobilization so that wartime agricultural financial power can be widely and deeply penetrated into rural areas. All business measures should be scientific and rational, so that they can play an active role and have high efficiency, in order to implement the central government's established policies.

<p>Berlin: According to official sources here last night, German Führer Hitler yesterday met with French Deputy Prime Minister Laval in a certain occupied area of France. The news of the meeting between Hitler and Laval, along with rumors that France might declare war on Britain, spread simultaneously (this rumor has been denied by the Vichy side). It is also said that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was also present at the meeting between Hitler and Laval. (United Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Vichy: Regarding the meeting between Deputy Premier Laval and German Führer Hitler, responsible officials here refused to disclose the content of the talks, only saying that it concerned the future of France and was the most important event since the establishment of the armistice agreement between France and Germany. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to the German News Agency, French Deputy Prime Minister Laval has traveled from Paris to Vichy. Upon arrival today, he immediately reported to General Pétain. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German official news agency declared that political figures here have not made any comments on the nature of the meeting between Hitler and French Deputy Prime Minister Laval. German newspapers only published this fact with large headlines. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>New York: According to Berlin news reported by various newspapers here, it is implied that Hitler is now attempting to gather the remaining French warships with the German and Italian fleets for a final battle against the British fleet. Several radio commentators have strongly stated that Hitler is most concerned about the willingness of the French fleet to cooperate. Suggestions regarding this matter occupied an important part of the discussions between Hitler and French Deputy Prime Minister Laval. Most commentators believe that France joining the German side in the war is unlikely, and they emphasize that the French people are unwilling and are different from their government. Many believe that British Prime Minister Churchill's broadcast to France anticipated the meeting between Hitler and Laval and recognize this as proof of Britain's well-informed sources in Europe. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Because Hitler, Ribbentrop, and French Deputy Prime Minister Laval held a sensational secret meeting in Paris, political observers here today suggested that as a result of the meeting, France might join the Axis powers in the war against Britain. It is also expected that Belgium and the Netherlands will immediately obtain the opportunity to unite with Germany and Italy, so that they can receive more lenient peace terms along with France when the European war ends in the future. People in Berlin firmly believe that the state of war between Germany and France can be said to have ended due to recent diplomatic negotiations between the two countries. Many believe that the French government will soon move back to Paris from Vichy. (International News Service dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Berlin: Today, it was officially declared here that the meeting between German Führer Hitler, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, and French Deputy Prime Minister Laval has been held in "a certain place in France." Many believe that the purpose of the meeting is to create closer cooperation between France and the Axis powers in the European war. It is reported that France will be given lenient peace terms, and if France can assist in defeating Britain, it may also be able to share a portion of the spoils of the British Empire. The official announcement did not mention holding a meeting in Vichy, which is generally regarded as extremely important. News circulated this morning that Marshal Pétain had refused the demand for France to share its fate with the Axis powers. If that is the case, many believe that Hitler may form a new French government under Laval. Many believe that ending the existing formal war between France and Germany is also one of the initial proposals of the meeting. If France is willing to assist the Axis powers, it is believed that Hitler may immediately approve a peaceful resolution, and France may therefore retain its pre-war territory within the country and throughout its entire empire, with the exception of Alsace-Lorraine and Savoy, as well as former German colonies before Djibouti. Informed sources say that if Britain is defeated, a portion of the British Empire, promising a portion of North Africa, may be granted to France as compensation.

<p>France Needs Peace, Eager to Cooperate with Germany</p>
<p>New York: A "New York Times" correspondent stationed in Vichy claimed that French Foreign Minister Baudouin, when receiving American newspaper reporters, strongly emphasized the need for peace and allowed cooperation between France and Germany. He said that if France is prepared to cooperate with continental Europe, it is because France has been invaded three times in the last century and has suffered greatly in each war because it did not eagerly seek a just peace. We in the new French regime will provide unlimited assistance to the genuine organization of Europe. France intends to cooperate with all countries in this spirit to prepare for the reconstruction of its own economy. Baudouin also said that the new restrictions on Jews are a security measure and have no racial significance. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Vichy Government Denies Preparing to Declare War on Britain</p>
<p>Vichy: Last night, the French government denied rumors that France was preparing to declare war on Britain. According to an official spokesperson, "The French government officially denies overseas rumors that Deputy Prime Minister Laval has negotiated a French declaration of war on Britain in Paris. The spokesperson said that this rumor is absurd, because Laval went to Paris yesterday to meet with Führer Hitler only to discuss general issues related to French-German relations." Subsequently, French Foreign Minister Baudouin also denied that France would fight any country. He said that France is only seeking peace and is willing to cooperate with Germany to rebuild Europe. He also said that the post-war disposition of Alsace-Lorraine will be extremely important in French-German relations. According to well-informed sources here, Laval has brought a draft of an extension to the French-German armistice agreement, which expires on September 25, to Paris. It is also said that Laval is seeking to obtain the French government's approval to return to Paris, but it is heard that the terms proposed by Germany for allowing this request have not been accepted by the Vichy government. (United Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Harsh Peace Terms, Pétain Resolutely Rejects</p>
<p>Washington: Last night, diplomatic circles here declared that Germany, two weeks ago, submitted a final peace proposal to the Vichy government on the condition that France participate in the anti-British war. It is said that Marshal Pétain and most cabinet members advocated rejecting the peace treaty, but Deputy Prime Minister Laval supported acceptance. Laval is currently visiting Paris to make efforts to accept the peace treaty. It is rumored that the terms proposed by Germany include the following: (1) France allows participation in the Axis powers to establish a new European order, but only participates as an allied country of the Axis powers. (2) Cede Alsace-Lorraine to Germany, and cede Nice to Italy. (3) The French naval, land, and air forces stationed in Africa participate in the Axis attack on Egypt and Palestine. (4) Germany and Italy take over French naval and air bases in the Mediterranean and Africa. (5) Redistribute French colonies. France can still possess Algeria, but must share French Morocco with Italy and return former German colonies. (6) Other French colonies will be jointly managed by Germany, Italy, and France. According to diplomatic circles, the peace treaty has caused heated debate in the Vichy cabinet. Foreign Minister Baudouin supports Laval's suggestion to accept the peace treaty. Laval believes that Germany's proposal of a peace treaty to France shows that Germany is extremely willing to quickly end the war for the "interests of Europe." Marshal Pétain disagrees with Laval's proposal. It is said that he will never sign this peace treaty with Germany. Defense Minister Weygand supports Pétain's proposal. All other cabinet members, except Navy Minister Darlan, support Marshal Pétain. It is heard that the French minister's opposition to Laval's plan is due to the fear that once the peace treaty proposed by Germany is accepted, the French colonies will be separated from the Vichy government and thrown into the arms of the Free French leader, de Gaulle. It is also heard that this peace treaty was proposed to France immediately after Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini met at the Brenner Pass. (United Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Zurich: According to the "Völkischer Beobachter," Axis powers recently proposed the following conditions to the Vichy government: (1) France will cede Alsace and Lorraine to Germany, and cede Nice to Italy. (2) Tunis will be divided between France and Italy, and Algiers will remain French. (3) France will cede northern Morocco to Spain. (4) The remaining French African colonies will be jointly ruled and developed by France, Germany, and Italy. (5) France will cede Vietnam to Japan. (6) France will hand over its Mediterranean fleet and the air force stationed in North Africa to the Axis powers for deployment for the purpose of attacking Britain. (7) If the above conditions are accepted by France, Germany will withdraw most of the occupied areas of France, with the exception of the Straits ports and the so-called blockade zone from the southwestern border through Burgundy to the Belgian border and the Saône River. The newspaper also said that after the above conditions were submitted to a special meeting of the Vichy government for review, they were rejected by the majority. General Pétain, General Weygand, and several other cabinet members spoke out against acceptance, while Deputy Prime Minister Laval, Foreign Minister Baudouin, and Navy Minister Darlan supported acceptance. Since the above request was rejected, Laval has gone to Paris again and is still continuing negotiations. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>The Hearts of the French People Have Not Died, Deeply Fearing Revolution</p>
<p>This morning's "Daily Express" in London published a message from Geneva stating that French leader Marshal Pétain fears that if he joins Hitler in fighting against Britain, a revolution will break out in France. The message also stated, "The Vichy government has issued a statement saying that France does not intend to fight anyone, only to resist aggression." The "Daily Express" commented, "Rumors that Marshal Pétain will declare war on Britain can be refuted without attacking them." Many believe that if Pétain joins Hitler, Pétain fears that a revolution will break out in France, and large-scale obstructive organizations have already been secretly established in France.

(Haitong dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Sofia: According to a report by Haitong News Agency's special correspondent, Baron Sassmann, regarding British diplomatic activities in Turkey and Greece, and British Secretary of War Eden's tour of Egypt and Palestine, all circles in Bulgaria are paying close attention. Since Romania established a new order, the hope of Britain causing disputes in that country has been dashed. There is now evidence that British propaganda agencies have chosen Sofia as the center of their Balkan propaganda activities. Recent startling news published in newspapers, such as the conflict between German and Soviet troops on the Romanian border, the entry of German troops into Bulgaria, and the construction of pontoon bridges by German troops on the Danube, were all issued from Sofia. Although the Bulgarian people pay great attention to this news, they all know that it is British propaganda, because there is no doubt that the Bulgarian people are now leaning towards the Axis powers. The Soviet Union will not interfere in the Balkans, and Turkey is also skeptical of the Soviet Union. As for the Soviet Union's policy, it is based entirely on national interests, so there will be no changes. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<p>London: This morning, German bombers changed course to the Midlands. The main offensive seems to have abandoned its attempt to break London's will with night raids. The British military believes that this change in German air strategy is a victory for British fighter jets and anti-aircraft guns. Since Hitler launched his "total air war" forty-seven days ago, London residents had their first few moments of rest last night. Last night and this morning, London's air raid sirens sounded twice. The first time was just after nightfall, as usual. The alert was lifted near midnight, at which time the German planes had already bid farewell to London after dropping a few bombs on suburban residences. The second alert was issued shortly after midnight, but it was lifted at 1:30 this morning. During both air raids, German planes did not reach the center of London. While London enjoyed an unusual silence last night, several cities in the Midlands were heavily bombed by German planes. It is reported that several people in a certain town were buried in the air-raid shelter of a certain hotel, and in another town, a large number of incendiary bombs were dropped, causing a large fire.

Some houses were destroyed in two towns, and several people were killed or injured.

According to reports received so far, although several bombs fell on a certain town on the southeast coast, the damage was minimal. A total of three enemy aircraft were shot down yesterday, and the British side also lost six fighter jets, but the pilots of two were unharmed. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>London: The Air Ministry's intelligence office said that on Monday night, British Air Force bombers heavily attacked the Blohm+Voss shipyards in Hamburg, which are building German warships. The air raid began at 8:00 p.m. and continued for more than an hour, dropping many tons of explosives and over a thousand incendiary bombs on the shipyards, docks, and their surroundings. At that time, the ground was covered in smoke, the searchlights were active, and the anti-aircraft fire was intense. British aircrews had difficulty carrying out bombing, but British planes attacked individually from all sides, which made it possible to avoid ground defenses and drop bombs that hit the shipyards and surrounding docks in many places, causing fires and becoming a large fire pit.

This type of concrete bomb has the power to penetrate the floors of ordinary houses. Germany's war expenses are huge and they have to seek substitutes.

<p>London – The British destroyer HMS Kimberley, which six months ago joined allied ships in the Arctic waters off Narvik, Norway, to defeat a German destroyer flotilla, has now triumphed in the sweltering heat of the Red Sea in an engagement with an Italian destroyer and shore batteries. Last night's naval communique stated that the Italian destroyer "Nullo" was forced aground and destroyed by torpedoes from the Kimberley. This is in stark contrast to reports from Rome. According to the British communique, on the night of October 20, two Italian destroyers in the Red Sea shelled a British convoy. The escort vessels immediately returned fire and gave chase, but contact was temporarily lost. The following day, at daybreak, HMS Kimberley, under the command of Lieutenant Commander Lee-chuson, re-engaged with an enemy vessel, identified as the destroyer "Nullo". In the 40-minute engagement, the Italian ship was severely damaged and ran aground near the shore. As the "Kimberley" fired torpedoes to destroy it, the "Kimberley" itself was hit by a shell from three enemy shore batteries, causing slight damage to a steam pipe and reducing speed. However, it continued to return fire, and as a result, two of the three shore batteries were destroyed and silenced. Three members of the Kimberley's crew were injured, but no other British ships or merchant vessels were damaged.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to the Air Ministry, an Italian destroyer in the Red Sea was attacked by British aircraft on Sunday, with a hit on the stern. This was part of a broader operation by the British Air Force in the Middle East on Sunday. Enemy engineering teams and motor transport vehicles between Solum and Buq Buq were attacked by low-flying British aircraft. Several enemy naval vessels were bombed, either catching fire or sustaining heavy damage. In addition, the British Air Force repeatedly attacked Asmara and Gura in Eritrea. Bombs hit oil tanks near factories, and buildings caught fire. An airfield in Bahrdar, Italian East Africa, was bombed twice, with buildings hit in the area of Tessenei. A British aircraft engaged an Italian aircraft over the Red Sea, pursuing it for thirty miles, witnessing it descending with heavy smoke billowing from its fuselage. Furthermore, a South African Air Force fighter, operating near the Kenya-Abyssinia border, shot down an Italian Caproni bomber, and the crew was captured. Several enemy aircraft flew over Malta on Sunday, where they were intercepted by British aircraft and fled in panic before dropping any bombs. (Reuter, 23rd)</p>

<h3 id="e49">United China Relief Fund; Fundraising Publicity Campaign; Tremendous Aid Provided to China in the Past Three Years; This Year's Rice Bowl Rally to Be Held Early Next Month <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The United China Relief Fund is the largest and most powerful organization in the United States providing medical assistance to China. It announced its establishment shortly after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, motivated by a desire to express sympathy for China and provide effective assistance. However, due to the U.S. government's neutral stance on the diplomatic front, its mode of operation was limited to medical assistance. From the perspective of the war of resistance, medical aid to China may seem to have no direct relationship to military affairs. In reality, it alleviates the suffering of the wounded and refugees, lowers the mortality rate of soldiers and civilians, and, most importantly, curbs the spread of infectious diseases. Therefore, medical aid to China, from the perspective of the overall war of resistance and the revival of China, not only indirectly provides tremendous assistance to the military but also has an immeasurable impact on the overall strength of the entire nation. The importance of the Fund's role in China's revival and war of resistance should be introduced and given special attention. (Last year, the Director of the National Health Administration broadcast from Chongqing that the cholera epidemic was extremely serious in 1938, but thanks to the assistance of the United China Relief Fund, it was much less prevalent this year. These few words testify to the Fund's contribution to our compatriots.)</p>
<p>For the past three years, the Fund has been constantly engaged in fundraising. It has reportedly dispatched medicines, hospital equipment, ambulances, and is currently constructing a vaccine laboratory in China (once completed, the laboratory will be able to produce vaccines domestically), totaling over one million U.S. dollars, an astonishing sum when converted to Chinese currency. The sources of the Fund's donations include direct solicitations from individuals, as well as a continuous stream of variety shows, concerts, lectures, dinners, street fundraising, and other ad hoc methods that can be devised. Each year, it also holds a major "Rice Bowl" fundraising drive. Because its activities cover a wide range and reach a large number of people, the result is not only the collection of huge sums of money but also a very effective publicity campaign to the American public, truly achieving two goals with one stone. The Fund has 75 branches in various cities across the United States and is still actively promoting and expanding. The headquarters is located in New York due to its strategic importance. Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, is the honorary president of the Fund. Colonel Theodore Roosevelt Jr., former U.S. President's son, who has a strong reputation in the United States, serves as the president, thus wielding significant influence. The members of the headquarters and various branches are all well-known figures from all walks of life, so every activity of the Fund proceeds smoothly. In addition, local officials also provide assistance, resulting in excellent outcomes. The New York World's Fair is a great location for publicity. Due to the war, the Chinese government was unable to participate in the fair last year, which was deeply regretted. This year, the Fund contacted the World's Fair authorities and was granted the former site of the Siamese pavilion free of charge. It was cleaned and renovated by the Fund and displayed jointly with Chinese merchants in the United States, promoting China and achieving significant results. In addition to the above, the Fund often invites American movie stars, famous playwrights, and other well-known figures to make radio broadcasts for publicity. For prominent figures from the Chinese political circles, painters, theater troupes, musicians, and other artistic talents coming to the United States, the Fund always tries every possible means to gather them together, deliver public lectures, hold exhibitions, or provide venues for performances. In short, the Fund exerts all its efforts and empties its brains, not letting any opportunity pass by. It can truly be called extremely hardworking and enthusiastic. Recently, Colonel Weiss, the president of the Fund, realizing that the American public's attention is focused on the European war, particularly the bombing of London, and fearing that China may be forgotten over time, has intensified its efforts to promote China in major newspapers and magazines, trying to reverse the trend. The results are said to be very good. The following is an excerpt from his recent statement:</p>
<p>"Currently, American attention is mostly focused on the European war, particularly the bombing of London. However, they are unaware that the devastation China has endured over the past three years is similar to that in Europe, and even worse than London. Moreover, China's war of resistance is not only for China's own survival but is fundamentally a struggle for democracy, for the preservation of culture, for the freedom of humanity, and for world peace. Therefore, its goals are highly consistent with the American people's psychology and ideals, and the significance of its sacrifices is the same as that of Britain today. Thus, the success or failure of China's war of resistance affects the United States as much as the success or failure of Britain. Fortunately, Americans are gradually understanding this interconnected relationship. Therefore, I firmly believe that from now on, Americans will continue to increase their enthusiasm for assisting China and will not be overly focused on Europe and Britain. As for the displacement, lack of clothing and food, and the spread of diseases among the Chinese people, the various sufferings are heartbreaking and have long been understood by the world. There is truly no need for me to elaborate further."</p>
<p>The "Rice Bowl" movement organized by the Fund, which caused a sensation throughout the United States, was held in major cities across America in the past two years, with the meaning and purpose of raising donations and promoting the cause. It has achieved remarkable results in the past, with the two "Rice Bowl" movements raising more than 370,000 U.S. dollars. The need for relief for Chinese wounded soldiers and refugees is now even greater than before. The Fund hopes for even better results from this year's movement and has already begun preparations. On September 16 of this year, the Fund announced the official launch of the movement, appointing New York City Mayor La Guardia as the chairman of the nationwide mayoral donation group, Huang Liushuang (Anna May Wong), a highly regarded actress and Chinese American, as the chairman of the nationwide film industry donation group, Carol Bruce, a famous young New York theater actress, as the chairman of the young theater industry donation group, and Niles Trammell, general manager of the N.B.C. radio station, as the chairman of the broadcast industry donation group. The chairmen of other industry donation groups are currently being contacted. The annual "Rice Bowl" rally is scheduled to be held within the first week of November. Major cities will be organized by local branches of the Fund, with events including "Rice Bowl" banquets and variety shows. Detailed programs have not yet been formally announced. New York has already scheduled a dinner and dance at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on November 1, and an "Open-Air Rally" will be held in Chinatown. At that time, there will surely be a lively and boisterous atmosphere.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Random Chat about the European War (22); The Duke of Windsor's New Position <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The Duke of Windsor is forty-six years old, and he looks younger than his age. Especially when viewed from a distance, he looks particularly young. He himself said, "I am neither old nor young," which is absolutely true. His eyes, which used to be chubby and the subject of jokes, are now different. When he talks or laughs, the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes are visible. It would be a joke to say that he is still a child.</p>
<p>At the same time, his brisk and agile steps, thick and lustrous hair that gently brushes over his eyebrows when a breeze blows, his enthusiasm, and informality all make him seem very young, appearing to be only forty-one or forty-two years old.</p>
<p>The Duke of Windsor also has the nature of an athlete. Five minutes after the "Somerset" ship sailed, he removed his tie, and on deck, he always wore a short-sleeved cream or light yellow sports shirt, blue shorts, and sometimes a printed handkerchief around his neck, with blue soft-soled shoes on his feet. He bought these shoes in Hamilton for thirteen shillings (equivalent to two dollars and sixty cents in U.S. currency), and occasionally wore them barefoot. His arms are not muscular but still shapely, and the section below the bend of his arm is tanned dark by the sun. When he doesn't wear socks, his ankles are visible, smooth and very white.</p>
<p>The former king speaks quickly and forcefully, making it difficult to understand. When talking to people, she calls him "Duke," and he calls her "Duchess," which is very formal. But in front of journalists and photographers, the Duke of Windsor repeatedly calls his wife "darling," in a very natural manner. She, on the other hand, has never called her husband that way in public. Both the Duke and Duchess laugh freely and unreservedly, the Duke of Windsor's laughter being "ha-ha-ha," which fully expresses his open heart. Her laughter is slow and natural, and her blue eyes are very charming and touching. The Duke of Windsor has an extremely strong memory for people's names and faces, which is incredibly useful. When he was on the throne, he reviewed countless army and navy troops, and as a rule, during the review, he would always stop and casually ask a few questions to those being reviewed. When hosting a large number of journalists, he always had a few considerate words for each person, which moved the listeners. For example, when he saw the New York Times reporter, he asked about Mr. Philip. He had always been the New York Times correspondent in Paris, covering the news about Edward's abdication and marriage. The Duchess of Windsor did not have this ability as much as her husband. When meeting guests, she would always pat her mouth with a handkerchief, smile, and say, "Hello."</p>
<p>The Duke of Windsor smokes both pipe tobacco and cigarettes—often smoking a pipe and then immediately lighting a cigarette. His wife joked with him, imitating his various poses when lighting his pipe. She said she had memorized four styles.</p>
<p>The Duchess is very particular about dressing. She is meticulous and attentive to her attire. Recently, because the couple had to travel from France by boat across the sea, it was not easy, and the clothes she wore were not as beautiful as before. She wore the same outfit when she landed in Hamilton and when she arrived in the Bahamas. In the past, she would never have done this. The outfit consisted of a pink and blue shirt and a light blue jacket. A beaded "Julia" style hat, with the brim in front. On the ship, she often wore a printed silk shirt, covered with a blue jacket, decorated with yellow, which is the couple's favorite color.</p>
<p>The Duchess looks like she is about thirty-six or thirty-seven years old. She speaks slowly, with both British and Southern American accents. Generally speaking, she does not trust politics, but she is very interested in the U.S. November election. Both she and the Duke laughed, saying that they had never seen a photo of Wilkie (the Republican candidate for president of the United States) with his feet on the ground, meaning that all the photos of Wilkie they had seen had his feet resting on his desk.</p>
<p>They both love photography very much and are themselves the best subjects for photographers. The Duke of Windsor spent twenty minutes on the ship checking everything prepared by the photographer DuPont. Finally, the couple decided that after arriving in Nassau, they would set up a photographic darkroom in the Governor's Mansion.</p>
<p>Anyone who has seen the Duke and Duchess of Windsor in person knows that their photos in many newsreels are nothing like them, especially the ones taken at the time of their marriage. The Duchess even frankly said that she has a mole on her right cheek, but it was carelessly captured by the camera, and in several newsreels, it looked extremely ugly. What she meant was that neither she nor the Duke of Windsor wanted to "show off" on the screen like movie stars, but on the other hand, they also had the right not to have their unsightly aspects captured by the camera. Therefore, she was very pleased to see the photographer on the ship checking the light and measuring the angles. At least this way, any blemishes on her face could be maintained as they were, and not be exacerbated, causing the entire face to suffer.</p>
<p>The Duke and Duchess of Windsor had informal conversations with us reporters on the ship, covering many topics and speaking frankly. They talked about various methods of military censorship, the political connections of American newspapers and publishers, the management of the London Times, the question of whether the British Archbishop also participated, American food, cars, and so on. When the Duke spoke to people, he often turned to his wife, as if to say, "What do you think?" The Duke and Duchess show great affection for each other, often unconsciously revealing it.</p>
<p>The Duke of Windsor and his wife are extremely fond of their three small hunting dogs. Wherever they go, these three dogs often follow. The Duke affectionately calls them "masters," while his adjutant really dislikes them, calling them "bandits."</p>
<p>The Duke of Windsor is five feet six inches tall, and his body is very proportionate. According to his tailor, his measurements are chest 36 inches, waist 29 inches, hips 36 inches, and pants 29 inches. The Duchess is slightly shorter than him, slender and graceful. The two standing together are truly a beautiful couple. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The President Coolidge of the American President Lines arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from the United States. The newly appointed American Consul General to Shanghai, Lockhead, and the newly appointed French Consul General, Mageley, as well as the Counselor of the French Embassy, ​​Pengu, all arrived in Shanghai on the ship. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e53">U.S. Consul General <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Arrived Ashore in the Rain, Greeted Extensively</p>
<p>Lockhart, who was returning to Shanghai from the United States, was originally scheduled to come with his wife. However, en route, he received an order from the U.S. government to evacuate American citizens, so upon reaching Hawaii, he waited for the ship to turn back. Mr. Lockhart then traveled alone on the President Coolidge liner, arriving at the port at seven o'clock yesterday morning. He transferred to the small tugboat "Manila Maru" and disembarked at the New Customs Wharf at nine o'clock in the morning. U.S. military and government officials stationed in Shanghai, as well as Mr. Lockhart's friends, braved the rain to welcome him. Mr. Lockhart disembarked amidst cheers and shook hands with the welcomers one by one. At that time, some American expatriates inquired about Mr. Lockhart's opinion on the U.S. government's withdrawal of expatriates from the Far East. Mr. Lockhart stated that the U.S. government's order must be implemented as fully as possible. He then took his consulate car to the U.S. Consulate on Jiangxi Road to rest.</p>
<p>Will Take Office This Morning</p>
<p>After arriving at the consulate, Mr. Lockhart met with newspaper reporters and stated that he would be taking office soon. According to this newspaper's investigation, Mr. Lockhart and acting Consul General Patrick had already agreed yesterday afternoon to handle the handover this morning and officially take office. Mr. Lockhart first served as a counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. When the previous U.S. Consul General Gauss was promoted to Minister to Australia, he also served as acting Consul General in Shanghai. Therefore, he is very familiar with the situation in China and is indeed a friend of China. Those who arrived in port on the same ship as Mr. Lockhart also included Mr. Caldwell, the U.S. Consul General in Tianjin, and Mr. Dunbar, the U.S. Vice Consul in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Acting Consul General Will Return Home Next Month</p>
<p>Acting Consul General Patrick has been serving as acting Consul General in Shanghai since the previous Consul General Gauss returned to his country, for almost four months, with remarkable achievements. He has put even more effort into the work of evacuating American citizens. Now that the new Consul General has arrived in Shanghai, someone is available to take over his responsibilities, and he is scheduled to return to his country with his wife on the U.S. mail ship President Pierce on the first of next month.</p>
<h3 id="e54">French Consul General <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Landed on the Bund in the French Concession</p>
<p>The previous French Consul General, Oki, resigned after the establishment of the Petain government. Mr. Majella, who was in the United States, was appointed by the Vichy government to take over as the French Consul General in Shanghai. Mr. Majella arrived on the President Coolidge liner yesterday morning around four o'clock and landed at the French Bund wharf amidst military music. At that time, the French Concession defense forces and the French Concession police sent a large number of soldiers and police to guard the area.</p>
<p>Took Office Immediately After Arriving at the Consulate</p>
<p>After landing, Mr. Majella shook hands with the welcomers with a smile and went directly by car to the consulate at No. - 公館馬路. Those who came with the French Consul General this time also included Mr. Peng Gu, Counselor of the French Embassy in China, and his wife. After the new French Consul General arrived at the consulate, he rested briefly and then took office, meeting with his subordinates one by one.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Majella Are Well-Known Figures in Diplomatic Circles</p>
<p>According to a Havas News Agency report from Shanghai, the new Consul General Majella is 40 years old. He was first assigned as an embassy attaché on June 2, 1921, and then assigned to the embassy in Belgium at the end of that year. In December of the following year, he was promoted to Secretary of the Embassy in Germany. In August 1933, he was promoted to First Secretary of the Embassy in the United Kingdom. At that time, the French Ambassador to the United Kingdom and the embassy counselor were both unmarried, so Mrs. Majella hosted the guests at every banquet. Mrs. Majella was graceful and luxurious, and was well-known in London diplomatic circles. In 1939, he was promoted to Counselor of the Embassy in the United Kingdom and participated in all the important negotiations between the United Kingdom and France, making many contributions. In September of that year, when the European war broke out, Mr. Majella asked the government to join the army, but the then Foreign Minister Reynaud not only did not approve it, but instead recalled Mr. Majella to serve as the Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It was not until the end of June of this year that he was appointed as the Consul General in Shanghai. In addition to his wife, Mr. Majella also brought three children with him.</p>
<p>Counselor Peng Gu Has Held Important Positions</p>
<p>Mr. Peng Gu, Counselor of the French Embassy, who came to Shanghai on the same ship as the French Consul General Majella, has long been renowned in diplomatic circles. According to a Havas News Agency report from Shanghai, the new Embassy Counselor Peng Gu is the nephew of Mr. Peng Gu, the former Prime Minister of the French Cabinet. He is 42 years old. On August 18, 1922, he was assigned as an embassy attaché. The following year, he served as Secretary of the Embassy in the United States. During the ten years from 1923 to 1930, he was repeatedly assigned to attend meetings of the League of Nations, achieving remarkable results in diplomatic negotiations. For example, when the Disarmament Conference was held in January 1932, Mr. Peng Gu served as the Secretary-General of the French delegation. After returning to his country, he twice served as the Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In August 1930, when the League of Nations held its 15th General Assembly, he was again assigned as the Secretary-General of the French delegation. In 1935, he served as the First Secretary of the Embassy in Romania. Later, he served as the Commissioner of Intelligence at the Embassy in the United States. After the outbreak of the war, he made unique contributions to the establishment of the Propaganda Department. It was not until June of this year that he was entrusted with his current position.</p>

<p>Since the military police tightened their inspection of all iron gates along Minguo Road on the 21st, the strict measures regarding those without "citizen certificates" have not yet been cancelled after many days. The civilians living in Nanshi are also taking precautions themselves and staying at home to avoid the patrols and inspections by the Japanese military police and "municipal police." The Nine Acres area, which was originally the commercial center of Nanshi, is now experiencing a sudden economic slump due to restrictions on entering and leaving Nanshi and the concessions.

<p>Since the movement to raise funds for winter clothing allowances was launched in all sectors of Shanghai, it has been actively carried out with all efforts. This movement is of profound significance, and it is not only about the thin clothes of the soldiers at the front and the cries of hunger and cold of the people in the rear. Therefore, those who have been persuaded to donate and contribute are very enthusiastic. It is said that the funds raised have now exceeded the expected target (500,000 yuan). The 31st of this month is the deadline for this movement. In this short distance of one week, it is also the last opportunity for all sectors of Shanghai to make efforts. It is expected that the fundraising results will be doubled.</p>
<h3 id="e57">The Situation in the Japanese Blockade Zone in West Shanghai is Extremely Serious, Thousands of People Have No Supplies and Will Become Starving Corpses, Residents Send Letters Describing the Tragic Situation, Urgently Hoping That People with a Sense of Justice Will Pay Attention <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The English-language "Da Mei Daily" reported that after Sergeant Saito Seiichi of the Japanese military police was shot and killed by three assassins near No. 608 Jisi Fei Road (i.e., Qianjia Lane, leading to Yuyuan Road) last week, the Japanese side immediately implemented a "counter-lockdown" on the lane, and then declared that the blockade had been lifted on the morning of Sunday. In fact, the connection between the 4,000 Chinese residents of the lane and the outside world is still being cut off by the Japanese side today (the 23rd).</p>
<p>All Kinds of Food Have Been Sold Out, Food is Extremely Scarce. Although Several Bags of Rice Have Been Seen Transported into the Lane, It is Not Yet Known for Sure Whether This Rice Will Be Used to Help the Residents. It is Said That There is a Chinese Food Store Near the Entrance of Xujia Lane to Jisi Feier Road. In the First Two Days, It Was Still Able to Supply the Residents of the Lane with its Stock, but It Was All Sold Out by Sunday. At the Beginning of This Week, the Residents of the Area Were Forced to Buy Flags for Five Yuan and Eight Corners, with Black Borders Around the Flags to Show "Mourning" for the Killed Japanese Military Police.</p>
<p>Want to Implement the Baojia System. It is Said That the Japanese Authorities in West Shanghai, i.e., the Japanese Military Police Team Transferred from Wuxi, Now Plan to Implement the "Baojia" System, Forcing Ten Households to Elect a Jia Head and One Hundred Households to Elect a Bao Head. If an Incident Occurs, the Baojia Head Closest to the Scene of the Incident Must Be Responsible and Punished. It is Believed That Nanshi is Also Planning to Implement This System. In the Past Few Days, Nanshi Has Been Heavily Guarded, and Chinese Residents Must Replace Their Passes. The Curfew, Which Has Been Suspended for Five Months, Has Also Been Reinstated. In Addition to Inspecting the New Passes of Chinese Residents, the Japanese Military Police in Nanshi Also Search Pedestrians and Vehicles on the Main Roads.</p>
<p>Residents' Letters Describe the Tragic Situation. Yesterday, a resident of Lane 668, Yuyuan Road, sent a letter to this newspaper, saying, "Editor, I have read today's report in your newspaper on the news that a part of the northern district of Yuyuan Road in West Shanghai was blockaded due to the assassination of a Japanese military policeman. It vaguely stated that it had been opened at 5:30 p.m. yesterday. This is not very consistent with the facts. The blockaded area is 'all areas north to Kainar Road, south to Yuyuan Road, west to Yidingpan Road, and east to Jisi Fei Road (except for the alleys along the road that have no back door).' This area covers more than 300 acres. In addition to the alleys along the road, there are a total of</p>
<p>More Than 7,000 Residents. Qianjia Lane, which is mentioned in the newspaper, is the more lively street in the area. There are countless other roads, from independent houses to smaller alleys and old-style rural bungalows. There are also about 20 factories, with 2,000 to 3,000 people per month. Since the assassination occurred on the afternoon of last Friday, all the entrances to the surrounding roads in the entire area have been blockaded. In the first two days, residents were occasionally allowed to go out to buy vegetables. Recently, it has become increasingly strict, and no one is allowed to enter or leave. Occasionally, relatives and friends of residents buy food outside and want to deliver it across the alley</p>
<p>Bamboo Fence. They Are Also Prevented. It Has Been Four Days Now. Except for the Telephone, There Is Absolutely No Contact With the Outside World. There Was Originally a Small Vegetable Market and Several Food Stores in Qianjia Lane. They Have All Been Sold Out in the Past Two or Three Days. Moreover, Most of the Residents There Are Poor and Have No Food to Last Overnight. Once Blockaded, They Are Afraid That They Will All Become Starving Corpses. Some of the Residents Are Outside (Of Course, They Cannot Return Home). I Have</p>
<p>Blockade Date and Opening Method. I Don't Know What to Do. In Short, the Current Situation There is Very Tense, and it is a Matter of the Lives of More Than 7,000 People, Which is Quite Serious. In the Current Environment, Of Course, Public Opinion Has Lost Its Power, But Justice is in the Hearts of the People. Through the Truthful Propaganda of Your Newspaper, Perhaps in a Helpless Situation, I Can Get One or Two</p>
<p>Slightly Just People to Pay Attention and Achieve Practical Results. I Am Also a Person Whose Home is in That Area. Recently, I Have Temporarily Been Sheltered at a Friend's Place and Have Been Separated From My Family for Four Days. I Have Experienced it Personally and Know More Details. Therefore, I Do Not Hesitate to Spend Words and Dare to Express My Opinion. I Hope You Will Consider it. Sincerely Yours, A Resident of Lane 668, Yuyuan Road, October 22.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Trade Negotiations Between the UK and France Begin in Hong Kong and Vietnam, Heard That An Agreement Has Been Reached, Waiting for Concrete Decisions, British Ships Sailing to Gong Prefecture Quietly Waiting for the Lifting of the Ban <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>British merchant ships sailing to various ports in French-owned Vietnam, since the signing of the transit agreement between France and Japan, the British naval authorities stationed in the Far East, in view of maritime safety, ordered the suspension of sailing pending further orders. British merchant ships Taikoo and Jardine here have changed their routes to Hong Kong, Siam, Singapore and other places.</p>
<p>Territorial Ports. The British naval authorities ordered each British shipping company to decide to suspend sailing to Vietnam. Following the rise of British merchant ships, four ships of the French Mail Ship Company, Los, Yaro, Jindia, and Datainan, have sailed. In addition to the Los ship, which departed from Shanghai to Haiphong and Saigon on the 20th, the Yaro ship was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai this morning to sail south, but because it was fumigating the ship in Shanghai and loading cargo today, it was changed to sail to Defence Gong tomorrow. The Jindia ship arrived in Shanghai early today, carrying more than 13,000 bags of foreign rice, and is scheduled to go to Defense Gong on the 26th. The Datainan ship is expected to arrive here at the end of the month. As for British ships sailing to French-owned territories, they have disappeared, but</p>
<p>British Ships Resuming Sailing to Various Ports in Vietnam Has a Good Chance of Resuming. According to information obtained by the shipping industry, the British authorities in Hong Kong have already begun trade negotiations between Hong Kong and Vietnam with the French authorities, including British ships sailing to Guangzhou Bay, Haiphong, Saigon, and various French-owned ports. Although it has not yet reached a concrete stage, the restoration of British goods trade and ships is only a matter of time. It is heard that an agreement has been reached in the negotiations, and a concrete plan will be sought in subsequent negotiations. Therefore, once Hong Kong and Vietnam resume shipping, there will be no problem for Taikoo and Jardine ships in Shanghai to resume sailing. The authorities of the two companies are quietly waiting for the lifting order from the Hong Kong head office.</p>
<h3 id="e59">After the News of the Evacuation Spread, British Expatriates Remained Calm, Believing That There Would Be No Changes in the Situation for the Time Being, A Few Children Have Already Left Shanghai <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Since the British side announced the day before yesterday that British expatriates who do not need to stay in Shanghai should consider evacuating, British expatriates in Shanghai discussed this issue yesterday, but they were all extremely calm and still could not change their wait-and-see attitude, believing that there would be no drastic changes in the situation for the time being. This statement has been circulating for a week, but all parties believe that it is more difficult than the evacuation of American expatriates, because most of the British merchant ships are assisting the British government in carrying out other wartime necessities, so there is a great lack of shipping equipment for evacuating expatriates. However, in the past week, a few children of British expatriates have been led by their mothers to Canada and Australia.</p>
<p>The UK Hopes Expatriates Will Leave</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 23rd. A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that reliable sources in London believed that although British Ambassador to Japan Clark had not implemented emergency measures to recall British expatriates traveling in Japan, British people who did not have important matters to stay in Japan should take advantage of this travel convenience to leave the country.</p>
<p>The Number of American Expatriates Evacuating Continues to Increase</p>
<p>As for the issue of American expatriates evacuating, according to yesterday's news, the number of people applying to book cabins has continued to increase compared to a few days ago. They are not hesitant to pay twice as much for travel expenses as ordinary mail ships. However, American expatriates are pleased that Secretary of State Hull has paid close attention to their complaints about the high cost of shipping and has stated that the government will find ways to prevent shipping companies from taking advantage of the current situation to profit. It is also heard that in addition to sending telegrams to Washington requesting economic assistance for American expatriates who are unable to evacuate, some American expatriate groups have suggested leasing Dutch ships for evacuation.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Traffic in the French Concession Resumes, All Roads Open to Traffic This Morning, Took Time to Organize, Some Roads Opened to Traffic Yesterday, Temporary Workers of Chinese and Russian Nationality Have Been Dismissed <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>After the French Tramway Company strike, representatives from both labor and management signed a resumption of work agreement at the Luban Road Main Factory the day before yesterday (22nd). All employees of the company's machinery department, vehicle department, and engine room, more than 1,000 people in total, resumed work yesterday. However, because the agreement was not completed until 6 p.m. the day before yesterday, most of the workers did not have time to notify them that night, and the workers detained in the police station were not released until 9 p.m. Therefore, the workers who resumed work did not arrive at the factory until noon. The company sent pressure cars to inspect the tracks and electric wires everywhere. The workers in the machinery department also began repairing the vehicles. It was not until about 1 p.m. that the inspection of the tracks and electric wires everywhere was completed.</p>
<p>Cars Driven in the Afternoon. At 1 p.m., the organization work was completed in part. More than 10 trams on Route 2, more than 10 trolleybuses on Route 17, and 20 buses on Route 22 were dispatched from the factory to resume operation. By 3 p.m., trams on Routes 1, 7, and 10 had also resumed operation. Other trolleybuses on Routes 18 and 24, buses on Route 21, and all vehicles connected to the Public Concession were scheduled to resume operation completely this morning.</p>
<p>Short-Term Workers Dismissed. During this strike, the factory hired more than 100 temporary Chinese workers and more than 50 Russian workers, so the tap water engine room and coppersmith room were able to operate as usual. Until yesterday, in order to fulfill the signed conditions, the factory issued dismissal fees to these temporary workers and dismissed them.</p>
<p>Universal Allowance. There are a total of more than 200 staff members in the French Tap Water and Electricity Company on Luban Road. They were not involved in the strike this time. However, after the workers and the management signed the conditions, the company's staff members also benefited in the same way. For example, after the workers were given wage increases and rice allowances, the staff members were also treated the same. Therefore, this time the workers' allowance was increased by six yuan, and the company's staff members were also given an additional six yuan without exception.</p>

<p>According to a foreign reporter in Shanghai, people from all walks of life in India have voluntarily donated more than 1,500 rupees to the Governor-General's wartime donation and the St. Dunstan's donation, which shows that India is extremely sympathetic to the UK. Since the outbreak of the European war, the Governor-General of India has advocated for wartime donations. Although there is no explicit announcement, people from all walks of life have donated very enthusiastically, either donating 100,000 rupees or donating a few Annas, or deducting a certain amount from the donor's salary every month. Although the amount is not very large, it accumulates gradually and gradually forms a huge amount. A few donors specified the purpose when making donations, while the rest were left to the Governor-General to decide. In addition to the above two types of donations, there are other donations of various types, such as the Red Cross donation and the donation initiated by local officials.

All the committee members attended the meeting on time. In addition to reporting on committee affairs, the chairman read out various incoming and outgoing documents, and then began to discuss the principle of giving a 5% legal profit to foreign rice sold in the market, which was agreed upon by the Shanghai Rice Evaluation Committee. After careful study, they all agreed that this method is still reasonable under the current circumstances. It is heard that it has been amended and passed and will be sent back to the committee within days, urging it to convene a meeting as soon as possible to discuss concrete measures and implement them on schedule.</p>
<p>Gong Rice Will Arrive</p>
<p>The first batch of Gong rice, which was agreed to be sold by the rice industry firms, has already arrived in Shanghai and has been sent to the godowns separately. There are also more than 200,000 bags of Gong rice that have been agreed to be sold and are on their way to Shanghai. They can all arrive in Shanghai by the end of this month. As for the source of the national rice, the general traders continue to purchase large quantities from various rice-producing areas at all costs, in order to transport them to Shanghai for sale in sequence.</p>

The following is a summary of its methods: (1) It is stipulated that each person can buy rice up to one yuan in Shanghai legal tender, and no more can be bought. (2) Each yuan sells four catties of rice. (3) Each household can still sell up to 50 bags of rice per day. (4) Sales time is from the afternoon of each day until 50 bags are sold out at any time. (5) Those who buy rice can get rice tickets and then go to the rice distribution point specified on the rice ticket to receive the rice.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Coolidge Liner Passengers Experienced Dangers En Route, A Major Case of Robbery and Murder Occurred on Board, And a Hurricane Broke a Priest's Leg, All Passengers Were Refreshed After Arriving in Shanghai <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The English-language "Da Mei Evening News" reported that the President Coolidge, a transpacific mail ship of the American President Lines, departed from the Old Gold Mountain and arrived in Shanghai this morning (13th). The ship had experienced dangerous events such as assassinations and hurricanes during this voyage, but the passengers who arrived in Shanghai all looked happy and full of energy, and were eager to ask about the current situation in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Murder for Money, Chinese Died Miserably</p>
<p>The President Coolidge left San Francisco 19 days ago. That night, a middle-aged Chinese passenger in third class was found hanging in the washroom, but there was a deep wound on the back of his head, which was obviously caused by someone hitting him and then deliberately creating the suspicion of hanging. Moreover, when he boarded the ship, he was carrying 10,000 Hong Kong dollars, worth 5,000 US dollars, which was also missing. Therefore, when the ship arrived in Honolulu, US detectives boarded the ship to investigate, but it was never found out who the victim was.</p>
<p>After Receiving the News of the Evacuation, Many People Turned Back</p>
<p>The news of the State Department's order to evacuate American expatriates from the Far East shocked the passengers who were planning to come to Shanghai and did not know what to do, especially women and children, because they did not know whether they would be allowed to disembark in Shanghai. Many women and children who were planning to come to Shanghai immediately disembarked in Honolulu and stopped their journey to the East.</p>
<p>Met a Storm En Route, Passengers Were Injured</p>
<p>Six days ago, when the President Coolidge was 600 miles from Yokohama, it suddenly encountered a hurricane, which lasted for three hours. The wind speed was 111 miles per hour, causing many portholes on the side of the ship to break and many passengers to be slightly injured. Four missionaries were seriously injured, one of whom was Dr. Thomas, a doctor from the American Northern Baptist Church in Shanghai. He was shocked on the side of the ship, jumped up, and fell on the other side, causing a hip injury and a broken leg. The injury was quite serious, and it was suggested that he disembark in Yokohama for treatment, but Mr. Thomas preferred to come to Shanghai for treatment. The other three missionaries left the ship in Yokohama and were sent to the hospital.</p>

<p>Hu Chengdong, 43 years old, from Hua County, Henan, residing at 525 Henan Road, recently filed a petition through lawyer Zhou Yongquan to the Civil Division of the Special No. 2 Court against Xu Maotang, manager of the China Remittance Bank (41 years old, from Ningbo, residing at 65 Zhengjia Lane, West Aihans Road),</p>
<p>seeking mediation for payment of 12,240 yuan in living expenses. The petition stated that the plaintiff was introduced to the Xu residence as a bodyguard in 1927, with a monthly salary of 26 yuan. Subsequently, due to his loyalty and diligence, he was favored by the master and his salary was increased to 38 yuan. In 1931, the old master, Qingyun Gong, fell seriously ill. After medical diagnosis, it was determined that a blood transfusion was necessary before surgery could be performed to support the patient's body. Therefore, the</p>
<p>entire household's servants were tested, and only the tea server Yu Along and the plaintiff had the same blood type as the old master. At that time, the defendant, Xu Maotang, stated that if someone could donate blood for his father, they would be an "Xu family benefactor" and would be supported by him forever. At the time, anxious to save the old master's life, the plaintiff readily agreed. After the doctor performed the blood transfusion, although Qingyun Gong could not extend his life, the plaintiff suffered from excessive blood loss, resulting in muscle aches and bone pain whenever it was windy or rainy,</p>
<p>resembling a cripple. He thought that since he would be supported by the master for the rest of his life, there was no need to worry about unemployment, and his mind was at ease. Unexpectedly, last year, the defendant used the excuse of cutting expenses and went back on his word, dismissing the plaintiff, clearly "killing the dog after the rabbit is dead," violating his promise. It is impermissible to buy people's blood with money. Now, the defendant, a prominent figure in society, has broken his promise, causing someone to donate blood for his relative,</p>
<p>violating contractual obligations, which is unacceptable both legally and morally. Therefore, he filed a petition requesting the defendant to appear in court for mediation, fulfill his contractual obligations, and pay the living expenses of 12,240 yuan in one lump sum, calculated at 60 yuan per month until the age of 60. Yesterday, Judge Shen Youqi heard the case. The defendant's lawyer, Yu Xilou, appeared in court and stated that he did not agree with the plaintiff's request. After questioning, the court ordered the plaintiff to formally file a lawsuit.</p>

Subsequently, the two Russians fled headlong and disappeared without a trace. As a result, the constable's hat brim was pierced with a hole.</p>

Judge Hillmic interrogated him. At that time, Lallie claimed that he had acquired "Chinese" nationality and was not a US citizen, requesting to be found not guilty. Subsequently, the judge ordered him to be released on bail of $11,000 US dollars pending trial. At the same time, the American court immediately investigated his nationality. Yesterday morning, the case was continued in the American court. Because the local lawyer, Li Quesheng, had reported to the judge's office that Lallie was indeed a US citizen, Judge Hillmic briefly questioned him and then declared that the public prosecution of the case had been established. Lallie's crimes totaled 17 counts, and if convicted on all counts, he could face a sentence of 85 years in prison. It has been investigated that Lallie has lived in Shanghai for nearly 18 years.

<p>The Poor Children's School Relief Center, Room 519, Pudong Fellow Association, Edward Road, was founded by Zhang Guoquan, a local resident. He hired prominent figures to serve as directors and established 42 free schools with the aim of providing education to poor children. The initial source of funding was a grant of 10,000 yuan from the National Relief Committee. Later, due to insufficient funds, he publicly broadcast three times, appealing to</p>
<p>all sectors of society for donations, raising more than 20,000 yuan. On the 17th and 28th, two days, a local newspaper suddenly published two chapters of a novel entitled "Philanthropist" under the name of Gao Fei, which implicitly revealed the inside story of the Poor Children's School Relief Center. The so-called Gao Fei's real name was Luo Jiahua, a teacher at the Huanan Middle School on Nanjing Road. Since his</p>

<p>Zhu Xiuting, residing at No. 8 Yuanli, Limei Road, French Concession, owed the Zhejiang Industrial Bank 3,000 yuan in current account funds, which he delayed in repaying. The bank entrusted a lawyer to act as an agent to sue in the Civil Division of the Special No. 2 Court. Zhu also entrusted a lawyer to act as an agent for the defense, but the result was a failure, and the judgment was to pay back the principal and interest in full. The judgment was delivered to Zhu Xiuting by bailiff Chen Luzhen in person. Later, Zhu refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court, but because the time had exceeded the statutory appeal period, it was dismissed. Now Zhu claims that the judgment was delayed by the bailiff, and that he did not legally receive it, believing that the handwriting on the receipt was inconsistent with his signature. Therefore, he entrusted lawyer Gu Jirong to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Special Court against bailiff Chen Luzhen, seeking to confirm the handwriting. After Judge Liao Yuan opened the court, it was deemed inappropriate for the plaintiff to pay litigation fees in accordance with a case without value. The court ordered him to pay an additional 92 yuan in litigation fees according to the value of the subject matter of the previous case and rescheduled the trial. Now that Zhu has paid the litigation fees in full, the court continued</p>
<p>the trial yesterday afternoon. The result was a discussion to reschedule the investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e76">Automobile Transporting Opium Case: Ding Guohua Also Arrested, Qian Yangyuan's Mother Lured Him Out to Report to Police, Using the Alias Ding Shaotang, Interrogated and Ordered to be Detained <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Qian Yangyuan and Liu Mingsheng, the accountants previously assigned to "The Sino-Japanese Economic Research Society" at No. 82 Tongfu Road, drove Li Hongzhang's grandson Li Ruijiu's No. 9118 automobile, driven by driver Cao Musheng, to transport 128 taels of opium to a buyer at a certain number on Shandong Road. It was investigated and seized by the Narcotics Division of the Public Concession Police. The three, Qian, Liu and Cao, were arrested and sent to the Special No. 1 Court. They confessed that the opium was delivered on the instructions of the host of the association,</p>
<p>Ding Guohua.</p>
<p>The court concluded the trial and sentenced Qian and Liu to five years imprisonment and a fine of 1,000 yuan each, and Cao Musheng to two years and six months imprisonment on file. Qian Yangyuan's mother, Qian Huang, felt that her son's conviction was entirely due to Ding Guohua, while Ding himself was still at large, which was difficult to accept. Later, she learned that Ding was hiding in Room 323 of the Cangzhou Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road. Therefore, after the court's decision, she</p>
<p>rushed to the Cangzhou Hotel,</p>
<p>luring Ding to come out. Ding initially thought it was a negotiation about his son's living expenses after his conviction, so he followed her out. Unexpectedly, when they reached the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Seymour Road, she reported to the police and arrested Ding, bringing him back to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Because this case was handled by the Narcotics Division, it was transferred to the capital. Ding reported his name to the police station as Ding Shaotang, 33 years old, from Wuxing, Zhejiang. However, in order to evade guilt, he denied being named Ding Guohua. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Division of the Special No. 1 Court. Ding was tall and sturdy,</p>
<p>wearing an expensive suit.</p>
<p>Police lawyer Ru Baoyi requested temporary detention because the case required urgent investigation and requested a retrial. Judge Chuan Lin questioned Ding, asking whether he knew Qian Yangyuan. He answered that he did. He hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend him. After Judge Chuan questioned him, he ordered Ding Shaotang to be detained and rescheduled the trial for next Thursday.</p>

<p>To the Editor: I have just read the Shanghai news column in your newspaper on the 23rd of this month, which contains a news item about the lawsuit involving the transfer of the Chinese Medical College. It mentions that "Ma, etc. transferred the college to the Zhu He Zhu Xiaonan brothers, and the Zhu brothers then competed with each other for the position of dean, resulting in repeated lawsuits." This is not consistent with the facts. Xiaonan is the dean of the New Chinese Medical College, located on Wangjiasha Huayuan Road, which has no relationship with the Chinese Medical College on Chongqing Road, nor has there been any lawsuit with my brother Zhu He Gao to compete for the position of dean. The above record is obviously a misunderstanding. I hereby send this letter, hoping that your newspaper will correct it as soon as possible. Sincerely, Zhu Xiaonan, Dean of the New Chinese Medical College, October 23rd.</p>

<p>(Shaoguan News) The Qiongya Middle School and Qiongya Normal School, both provincial schools in Guangdong, have been suspended since the Japanese army occupied Qiongya last year. Countless students have fled to Guangdong. People from Qiongya have requested the Education Department to establish the Provincial Qiongya United Middle School in Suixi to accommodate students from Qiongya who fled the war. It has been investigated that there is an increasing number of students from Qiongya arriving in Shaoguan. The authorities plan to separate and relocate the Nanhai Qiongya United Middle School, leaving the normal school classes in their original location and moving the middle school classes to a certain location in northern Guangdong. The funds were originally divided into two schools, so there is no problem. It is reported that the Education Department intends to authorize the Qiong Travel Shaoguan Relief Association to appoint those with rich educational experience as principals after reporting.

<p>(Chongqing News) The National Central Vocational School was established in January 1939 by the Ministry of Education to meet the needs of wartime construction and national development. The school is located in a certain place in Sichuan and is divided into five departments: papermaking and leather making, dyeing and weaving, agricultural product manufacturing, and sericulture. The admission qualification is high school graduation. The first phase was scheduled to graduate in two years. This year's enrollment is for the second phase, which has been changed to three years of graduation. There are currently two classes per department, a total of ten classes, four hundred students. More than twenty experts specializing in research and manufacturing experience have been hired to serve as professors. Several technicians are employed in each department to assist in guiding practical training. In addition to daily teaching, professors devote most of their energy to industrial experimentation and research, and are committed to guiding students to improve local products and old-fashioned industries. Although teachers are very strict with students, students have extreme faith in teachers. The atmosphere of harmony permeates the entire school. Seven factories have now been established, including papermaking, leather making, bleaching and dyeing, spinning and weaving, brewing, silk reeling, and silkworm seed production, which are scattered in various places. Each factory has considerable equipment. Some factories have already started mass production and selling goods. There are also improved local products with significant results and exquisite finished products that are not available on the market. The school's location is an industrial area, with numerous public and private factories scattered around, mostly with the same or similar characteristics as the vocational school's practice factories. Vocational school students, in addition to their own practical factories, also practice in other local factories. During winter and summer vacations, the school sends them to large and small factories in Yu Rong Zi Nei Ya Ba and other places for long-term internships. In the factories, they work diligently and tirelessly, fully demonstrating their spirit of revitalization. Students have both a theoretical foundation, proficient skills, and management experience. Recently, they have jointly established small-capital factories to generate income and practice their skills. The school's usual training of students focuses on hard work and endurance, obedience, and cooperation, and provides various service work opportunities inside and outside the school to develop leadership and command abilities. The training goals are loyalty, diligence, and strictness, and the unique school motto is practicality and creativity. This winter, each department will have thirty or forty graduates, which can meet the needs of various parties. Currently, large and small public and private factories and government schools and institutions are looking forward to hiring them.</p>

<p>The eighth match of the Kong Sheng Cup Table Tennis Tournament's final six, was held at the Jingwu Association gymnasium the night before last at 8:00 PM, with the Holy Group champion, the Gong Hua team, playing against the runner-up, the American team. In the group finals previously, the American team had narrowly lost to the other by one point, and this rematch was like enemies meeting on a narrow path, filled with animosity. Seeing the formidable opponent approaching, the Gong Hua team also strove to improve. Immediately after the start, the tension was palpable. In the first match, Yang Zhaoxiang of the American team defeated Chen Ruilong of the Gong Hua team, who played a short blocking style, with quick top-spin shots. In the second match, Ouyang Wei of the American team, an all-rounder, played against Zai Junquan, the captain of the Gong Hua team. Ouyang was the runner-up in the Shanghai individual tournament, with superior skills, while Zai was a rising star. Because Zai had been eliminated in the Jingwu Cup, everyone expected Ouyang to win easily. However, Zai became more courageous as the match progressed, his left-handed top-spin shots were incredibly accurate. After a dramatic five-game match, Zai unexpectedly came from behind to defeat Ouyang Wei, which was commendable. In the third match, Gu Wenxiang of the Gong Hua team lost in a counter-attack to Wang Changhou of the American team. In the fourth match, Rong Deneng of the American team, a skilled chopper, was defeated by Pan Yuexi of the Gong Hua team. After that, Zhang Liansheng, Ye Ziqing, and Huang Zhijun of the American team fought bravely and defeated their opponents in three consecutive matches. As a result, the American team defeated the Gong Hua team 5-2, wiping away their previous shame. Although the Gong Hua team lost, their performance was especially good. The scores are as follows:</p>

<p>In the Silver Coin Cup Table Tennis Tournament, Citibank played against Communications Bank the night before last at the Silver Union Club gymnasium. Only three of Citibank's five top players were present, with two substitutes attending, their lineup incomplete. Communications Bank, taking advantage of their victory over the strong Jin Cheng team, performed with extra effort. Therefore, the match between the two sides was very intense. Communications Bank had previously taken the lead at 5-3 and 7-5, but unexpectedly, Ruan Shaorong and Zheng Jiakun of Citibank delivered a stunning performance, winning several points in a row, turning a 7-8 score into a 6-6 tie. At this point, Communications Bank suffered a complete collapse and was overtaken by Citibank. As a result, Communications Bank was defeated by Citibank 8-13, losing a winning opportunity, which was a pity. Main player Liu Jihan won five consecutive matches, which was remarkable. There will be four matches tonight. Apart from the first match where Citibank is likely to easily defeat the China National team, the strength of the remaining teams is quite balanced, making it difficult to predict the winners. The results from the night before last and tonight's schedule are recorded below:</p>

<h3 id="e90">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Shanghai Orphanage, after the charity basketball game, will launch a charity table tennis competition. However, the method has not been practical. (It involves gathering famous table tennis players from the city based on offensive and defensive styles to hold a match). I would like to offer my humble opinion as follows:</p>
<p>Upon investigation, charity table tennis has been held several times last year, but its popularity was not as enthusiastic as this charity basketball game. The reason lies in the fact that the competition method does not use team names. If the old method is still used this time, it may affect ticket sales. (For example, in this charity basketball game, a certain team against the Paramount sold almost half of the tickets, and those who came to support at the time). If individuals are used as the unit, the ticket sales performance can be predicted. In the past two years, the "Qing Yun" and "American" teams have been the strongest in table tennis. In this summer's Kong Sheng Cup, there were also four rising forces: Huayi A, Jiufeng, Gonghua, and Wanhua A. If teams are used as the unit and the "Charity Basketball Method" is followed to hold multiple matches, on the one hand, each team will definitely work hard for the team's victory, fighting each other and seeking out outstanding talents to adjust their lineups. On the other hand, they will also compete for ticket sales, and the proceeds from ticket sales will definitely be more than the competition with individuals as the unit. The competition schedule can be arranged in the following days:</p>
<p>First Match (1) American vs. Gonghua (2) Qingyun vs. Jiufeng</p>
<p>Second Match (1) American vs. Wanhua A (2) Qingyun</p>
<p>Third Match (1) Qingyun vs. Gonghua (2) American vs. Huayi A</p>
<p>Fourth Match (1) Qingyun vs. Wanhua A (2) American vs. Jiufeng</p>
<p>Fifth Match Table Tennis Championship, Qingyun vs. American</p>
<p>(Note: Before the fifth match, a women's table tennis exhibition match will be arranged to make the atmosphere of the stadium more enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Ticket prices should be reduced as much as possible and can be set at 5 jiao, 1 yuan, and 3 yuan. (The last match can be increased to 5 yuan)</p>
<p>The above method is only a suggestion. If it can be realized, I am willing to donate all the balls used for the competition. I hope everyone will correct me.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Yu Yuanlin, Editor of the Shen Bao Sports Column, October 21st.</p>

<p>According to the Zi Lin Daily, on October 3rd, the city was flooded due to heavy rain, and there were deep puddles on the streets. A British expatriate named White Locke, who works for the Xintong Automobile Company, drove his car very fast on Jingan Temple Road, causing water to splash everywhere. A rickshaw passenger on the side of the road was splashed with water and suffered greatly. Angered, they asked Coudin, a western police officer from the Xinzha Police Station who witnessed the incident, to testify and appeal to the British Consulate General. Yesterday (the 22nd), Haynes, the inspector of the British Consulate General, summoned White Locke for questioning. Haynes expressed his gratitude to the Public Works Bureau's police department for paying attention to such incidents and appealing to the law. He also stated that drivers should not disregard pedestrians. He had personally witnessed several cars passing by, causing water to splash high, which angered pedestrians. White Locke replied that the car he was driving had a problem and had to continue driving to avoid stopping and blocking traffic. Haynes rebuked him, saying that if the car needed repairs, it should not have been driven out. The defendant disregarded other pedestrians, which was a fact. As a result of the trial, White Locke was fined three shillings, equivalent to 9.75 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Britain's Wartime Trade Controls <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Jun</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, Britain has established restrictions on import and export trade and introduced a credit guarantee system to develop foreign trade and consolidate wartime foreign exchange funds. Historically, the greater part of Britain’s peacetime income has come from manufacturing and trade, so maintaining this income in wartime is paramount. However, as a number of European markets fell into German hands, Britain has been unable to obtain the necessary goods and has suffered considerable losses. So, after the outbreak of war, the British government published a list of goods, the export of which from Britain itself was generally prohibited, which caused no small amount of misunderstanding at the time. The public at large thought that the listed goods were to be absolutely prohibited from export, but subsequent events indicated that they could still be freely exported under reasonable conditions, provided that an export license was obtained. This was to prevent a shortage of war goods, because in wartime, the stock of a particular commodity may be abundant one week and suddenly inadequate the following week, so that considerable control becomes necessary.</p>
<p>The British government, understanding the importance of maintaining export trade, has organised an export association to maximise the development of export trade in wartime conditions. To achieve perfect export trade, the Export Association has brought together many industrialists to form an export group and a committee. Special issues such as raw materials, prices, distribution and markets for each industry can be submitted to such committees for complete solutions. Since the formation of these associations by each industry, there has been a good and consistent approach to obtaining the raw materials necessary for export and to determining export prices, and the application for export permits from factories has also been made easier with the help of this body, while the manufacturing industry for export products has also been able to obtain a relatively advantageous position over the manufacturing industry for domestic consumption products. To support domestic manufacturing and to develop export trade, the British government has also introduced and widely implemented a warrant system, whereby the government guarantees to indemnify the seller against all losses where a contract of sale entered into between a British seller and a legitimate foreign customer cannot be fulfilled due to obstruction or if the customer fails to pay the price. Regarding the import of foreign goods into Britain in wartime, the restrictions are very strict. With the exception of goods considered necessary or welcome by the British government, the import of any kind of foreign goods is subject to strict restrictions and any person wishing to import them must first obtain the permission of the government at any time. This is because the import of foreign goods must be settled in foreign currency, which is a precious commodity in wartime and is needed to purchase essential basic goods for the war. At the same time, shipping capacity is only used for the transport of important goods, and if ordinary foreign goods were allowed to be freely imported, this useful capacity would be occupied, which would be detrimental to the war effort.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed rates. The unofficial market for GBP/USD was tight after a sharp drop. In the morning, the USD reached 5.90625 yuan due to speculative selling. Hong Kong Telecom sold shillings, and the price also firmed up. Later, due to the need for foreign firms to settle accounts, and the appetite of Mercantile Bank, the supply and demand gradually shifted, and the price returned to level. At the close, GBP was 3 pence 796875, and USD was 5.84375, resulting in the GBP being unchanged from the previous day's close, and the USD softening by 0.03125. Futures were consistently level.</p>

The banks' morning spot selling rates were GBP 3 pence 796875, and USD 5.84375, which was unchanged for GBP and 0.03125 tighter for USD compared to the previous day's close, due to the continued decline of the Lira. After opening, the market hardened due to competition among Chinese speculative traders. The USD for this month was bid up by speculators from 5.875 to 5.90625. In addition, Hong Kong Telecom came to sell, selling shillings for this month at 3 pence 8125 and 828125 to foreign firms. HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged.

As a result, GBP was 3 pence 796875, and USD was 5.375. This month's rate was the same as the spot rate. Next month's rates were GBP 3 pence 78125, and USD 5.84375, unchanged for both GBP and USD compared to the previous day.

<h3 id="e94">Outside Gold Market Continues to Weaken <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial market for spot gold continued to weaken. There were reports of transactions at 5,740 yuan, later rebounding slightly by several tens of yuan, and closing at 5,760 yuan, due to the foreign exchange market turning from loose to soft. Jewelry gold prices remained unchanged. Datong Bank still quoted 600 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Demand for USD Notes Decreases <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw no opening in the unofficial market for spot gold. However, transactions outside the market had already retreated to around 5,750 yuan, so the prices of GBP and USD notes also fell by 1 yuan each. Demand for GBP notes decreased, and the market price continued to fall by 1 yuan. The USD note price once fell to 16.50 yuan in the morning. The market turned tighter in the afternoon, rising to 16.63 yuan at one point, and finally closing at 16.60 yuan, up 5 fen from the previous day's close.

<h3 id="e96">Damaged Banknotes (Continued from the 19th) <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Yun</p>
<p>(8) If a strip or more is missing from a note and replaced with another paper to make it a complete sheet, if one of the two serial numbers is damaged, even if more than three-quarters of the note body remains, it will only be exchanged for half the value.</p>
<p>(Explanation) This type of banknote is deliberately created by counterfeiters, who intentionally remove a strip. After removing more than ten strips, they can be pieced together into a complete sheet. The removal method is also a specialized technique, such as removing the front or the back. The removed part is replaced with another piece of paper, while the removed back remains intact. Therefore, those who are unaware are easily misled. When they go to the bank to exchange it, it is only worth half the value. The method of identification is that whenever you encounter a patched banknote, one side is intact without any tears. When you pick it up and look at it, if you see a blank strip, it is a stripped note. However, there are also those that are completely stripped, and there are also those that have one side stripped and replaced with a counterfeit note. There are also those that have one side as a genuine note and one side as a counterfeit note. There are various tricks, so those who receive banknotes must carefully identify them.</p>
<p>(9) Banknotes that have been intentionally damaged will not be exchanged.</p>
<p>(Explanation) If a complete banknote is intentionally torn into several pieces or cut into several strips, even if it is patched completely and intact, it will be deemed invalid and worthless when exchanged at the bank. This is a warning to those who do not abide by public morals and intentionally damage currency. However, this type of loss often affects third parties. Therefore, if a formal business sends a letter to the bank explaining the reason for the mistaken receipt, it may be possible to exchange it for the full amount.</p>
<p>Correction: In item 2 of "Damaged Banknotes" published on the 19th, the phrase "one-quarter" in the sentence "If a note is broken and more than 'one-quarter' remains, it will be exchanged for half the value" should be "one-quarter and one," hereby corrected.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Yarn and Cotton: Cotton Yarn Bulls Eagerly Anticipate Price Increases; Indian Cotton Eagerly Sought in the Market <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to weaken. In fact, the continuous sharp increases in prices have led to profit-taking and new short selling activities. At the same time, Hong Kong merchants, because prices have reached high levels and recent import volumes have been considerable, are currently less enthusiastic about expensive yarn. Therefore, transactions have tended towards a quieter path. However, the morale of general speculative traders remains high. They absorb Shuang Ma factory orders firmly and do not give up. However, factories and large firms are selling off forward contracts across the board. In this regard, the current situation is certainly strong, but once the reaction comes, it is unknown what will happen.</p>
<p>The opening of the spot yarn market in the morning, because the buyers on the table were all holding several packages of Shuang Ma, would all suffer a loss if the price dropped, and would make a profit if it rose. Therefore, they all shouted and bought 20-count Shuang Ma yarn. The opening price was 1,280 yuan, slightly lower than the previous day. However, there was no shortage of buyers. However, securities firms and large profit-takers came out across the board, and the market turned out to be soft in the midst of strength. After a slight increase by the bulls, it rose slightly to 1,287 yuan. Then it was heard that the market price of a certain exchange was not only unable to advance, but also had a backward trend. At the same time, customer sales were not as strong as the previous day. Although all parties wanted to support it, the environment did not allow it, so it gradually fell to 1,265 yuan. The closing price was 1,268 yuan. According to the statistics of transactions in the half-day, 6,535 bales were traded. Hongzhang Factory launched 1,000 bales of 10-count Xinbao Yi at a price of 900 yuan. It was found that 2,565 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today. The amounts bought by each group are listed on the left:</p>
<p>Same Industry 5,900 Hong Kong 575 Wenzhou 60 Statistics 6,535</p>
<p>The situation in the cotton market was slightly calmer, because after the sharp increase in the yarn market, there was a change in the wind, so the momentum was slightly calmer. However, the industry's thinking is still firm. However, a batch of Indian cotton will soon arrive to regulate the market.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was slightly more active again. The firm prices of industry purchases and Wall Street stocks resulted in the closing price rising by 4 pounds compared to the previous day. India's price fell by more than 2 rupees yesterday, including forecasts.</p>
<p>The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been very lively in recent days, with spot goods being the most popular. However, because they are scarce in the market, factories have found it difficult to purchase them. Long staple fibers were bought up long ago. Yesterday, short staple fibers also became popular. The price of Indian cotton "pingguoer" jumped by a huge 5-6 yuan yesterday. Generally, it is expected that the price of cotton will rise sharply.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Grain: Foreign Rice Floods In <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice suddenly turned to a declining trend. At first, the hoarders were still hoping for a good price and demanded firm prices. At that time, the market had not changed. However, the actual sales prices increased, and it was privately estimated that the source of foreign rice arriving continuously. The 250,000 bags previously ordered have all been loaded. In addition to those that have already arrived, the others are also arriving one after another. In addition, retail shipments are even more endless. Therefore, the morale in the market suddenly turned weak and soft. Moreover, foreign orders are still in progress. It is said that the increased special war risk insurance has already been implemented, and it is not a new rule, but a pretext for hoarding goods to cause trouble. Seeing the situation is not good, they take advantage of the high prices to release their holdings, and for a time, everyone echoed each other, and the decline started suddenly. According to the closing market report, the entire city rose and fell together, with the prices depreciating by 1 yuan compared to the previous market. No. 2 Saigon was 63 yuan, No. 2 Siam was 61.78 yuan to 60.05 yuan, Xiaojiao was 61 yuan, Haiphong red tip was 57 yuan, Tokyo tip was 56-57 yuan, and Wuhu tip was also a small yuan, opening at 60.05 yuan to 59.5 yuan. Yesterday, Jianyuan ordered 500 tons of No. 2 Saigon at a price of 73.5 yuan, which was the same as a few days ago. Therefore, no one accepted the return of the original bags.</p>
<p>New Jingjian Yaozhong Baige, etc. continued to arrive in small quantities due to the rain, totaling 1-2,000 bags, so the new Jing continued to be popular in store sales, rising another 1-2 yuan. Yaozhong Baige was only so-so. It was estimated that Kunshan new Jing opened at 75 yuan to 72.5 yuan, original bags at 77 yuan to 76.5 yuan, Qingjiao Yaozhong at 77 yuan, Fengjing Baige at 73.8 yuan, and 73.5 yuan. There was a lack of goods in the wild rice market. Duyangjian remained empty, with all original bags at 70 yuan. Zaopo did not open. Su Changpo fell from 83 yuan to 77 yuan.</p>
<p>The market for glutinous rice wine continued to be lackluster, so although the market supply was not abundant, the market presented a soft-in-the-air appearance. Yi Li Puyuan opened at 77 yuan, Chang Dan goods at 75-76 yuan, Hong Kong glutinous rice at 75 yuan, down to 72-73 yuan, and glutinous tea at 65 yuan, down to 53-54 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Flour Sales Often Hindered <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The flour market is not very smooth, because customer sales have been flat recently, and transportation in various places is often hindered, so the customer appetite is not strong. The total market only includes nearly 10,000 bags of retail sales from the Chinese factory to this street. Other transactions are only a few hundred to 1-2,000 bags. The price of foreign flour has increased due to increased war risk insurance and shipping costs. Therefore, sellers are more reluctant to sell. Fushou brand flour is priced at 20 yuan, followed by 19.6-7 yuan. It is heard that several hundred bags were purchased on this street, and the old car return flour still requires 19 yuan, but there is no formal agreement.</p>
<p>The wheat market remained quiet, because arrivals and sales have been slow in recent days. Occasionally, small amounts of wheat from nearby areas are transported, and they are all designated to be sent to Japanese factories, with prices still around 21 yuan. The price of goods transported into the concession is high and cannot be collected, so the market has become tight again.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Securities: Domestic Debt Flickering; Sometimes Falling Sharply, Sometimes Rising High <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The securities unofficial market fluctuated quite rapidly yesterday, rising and falling suddenly, flickering uncertainly. Category C securities were traded in and out around 60 yuan, and the bulls gradually shifted, with obvious signs to be found. Most of them shifted from the hands of large firms to general retail investors, so sometimes they fell sharply, and sometimes they struggled to rise. Prices are too high, and a slight shake can easily lead to a decline. For the time being, the new bulls should be slightly cautious. Yesterday morning, Tungsunhong and Taiyou released large quantities, and the market price suddenly broke through the 60-yuan mark. Then, Lianhe and Lianyi greatly replenished their holdings, and Category C securities were again raised to 60 yuan. After entering the market, Yitai sold out, but Shun Chang and Wuyuan still had an appetite. Retail demand was strong, so the noon closing of Category C securities was stable. In the afternoon, Dingkang and Tongkang bought more than 670,000, and the price increased by two or three jiao. However, Hongda, Tungsun, Xinfu, and Defu sold out in large quantities. Although Yongkang and Yichang and general retail investors bought in, Seventh and Lianhe Hengfu sold more. Therefore, the market price could not be fixed, but it was still above 60 yuan. The closing market price resulted in a slight rebound of 5 fen to 2.5 jiao across the board. The number of transactions was still more than 1.8-9 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category High Low Close Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>National A 68.70 67.60 68.40 Fell 0.15</p>
<p>National B 65.20 62.50 62.85 Down 0.25</p>

<p>National E 60.20 59.60 60.00 Down 0.05</p>
<p>Stock transactions: 45 shares of Zhonghua Book Company were traded, with a price of 33 yuan, slightly higher than the previous price of 1-2 yuan.</p>
<p>The stock market of the Public Industry Association was weak in the morning due to rumors of the withdrawal of British expatriates. Later, due to the eagerness of short covering and new purchases, the rebound was quite rapid. The closing trend was stable again. Not many people were taking profits, and the trading was scarce and the interest was narrow.</p>
<p>London, 22nd (Wednesday report): Today's market prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British business companies' stocks are still flat. Although bank stocks showed a slight improvement, HSBC British-registered shares rose by 2 pounds, with a price of 62 pounds. Hong Kong-registered shares were unchanged, and the Bank of Indochina also rose by 2 shillings and 2 pence, with a price of 10 pounds, 7 shillings, and 6 pence. The rest were unchanged.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the cloth market saw mixed price movements due to the decline in raw yarn and the slight stagnation in actual sales. Prices for each type of goods saw both increases and decreases. For example, among white goods, fine cloth and fine twill fell slightly by 1-2 jiao per bolt, while fine yarn fabrics such as poplin also rose and were very sharp, because the industry's thinking was firm and high, and the street was actively hoarding. Furthermore, Hong Kong and Guangdong agencies continued to purchase colored cloth and colored twill for Zhuma and Shayu Chung without ceasing, and another 500+ pieces were traded yesterday. Dongpi Longtou fine cloth and serge were slightly weak, while mid-range fine cloth and fine twill were still strong. Fine cloth rose again by 5-6 jiao per bolt. 12-pound Flying Fish Trumpet Yanghe and other brands were all sold for 32.2-3 yuan per bolt.

<p>Yesterday in the oil market, initially in the morning, there was some market support because it was rumored that an agreement had been reached regarding the removal of stored oil, with a fee of four yuan per piece, and that a batch could be released yesterday morning. However, there was no actual confirmation of this. Although some hoarders manipulated futures, the overall situation remained mediocre. Transactions included: 50 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, priced at 70 yuan, 7 jiao and 5 fen; 400 pieces for delivery in three to four weeks, priced at 72 yuan, 5 jiao to 7 jiao 5 fen, then falling to 72 yuan 5 jiao; 50 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, priced at 100 yuan and 5 jiao; 100 barrels for delivery in the first ten days of November, priced at 102 yuan to 2 yuan 5 jiao; 400 barrels for delivery in the last ten days of November, priced at 103 yuan to 4 yuan 5 jiao.

<p>The first batches of new dried longans, such as those from Quanzhou, Tong'an, and Zhangzhou in Fujian, have arrived in small quantities, totaling three to four hundred dan. These are all goods from established merchants, and the quantity is still not large. Therefore, although there is hope for a price relaxation, it has not been excessive. It is expected to open today.</p>

<h3 id="e107">Snail Dwelling Rough Sketches <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Donglin</p>
<p>A snail is born inside its shell, grows inside its shell, and also dies inside its shell. Throughout the process of being born, growing, and dying, it perhaps never comprehends the world outside its shell, because it has its own world, its own space for survival. Can you classify it as being outside the realm of living things? It is born, grows, and dies in the same way as those who are of the "chicken-length" kind. It's just that the space they occupy differs in size.</p>
<p>Due to this almost grotesque thought, I gained a little comfort, because I am currently living inside a snail shell, living almost like a snail. Seeing those towering mansions and foreign-style villas outside, I sometimes can't help but feel a pang of frustration, but when I think of snails, I feel relieved. If snails can survive, how can I not?</p>
<p>I don't intend to write a "Snail Shell Travelogue" or a "Snail Shell Living Report" at this moment, because the noble people must believe in the theory of evolution, and they would definitely not be interested in this snail shell life that has regressed ninety-eight thousand years, let alone take a casual tour. Therefore, I will only write some rough sketches, both as a way to amuse myself, and naturally also as a reference for other snails.</p>
<p>In order to avoid the embarrassing stares from the upper-class gentlemen, and to avoid being too vulgar and hurting their dignity (no, their noble eyes), I think it's better to change it to "snail dwelling." Changing it to "dwelling" should make it more elegant. Aren't there also "dwellings" with such-and-such names inscribed in front of many foreign-style villas? I am not Ah Q, but I would rather be a bit like Ah Q, just this once, with no future repetitions, it's okay.</p>
<p>I had already bought my paper, ink, and writing brush long ago, preparing to write two large characters "Snail Dwelling" in the style of the Cao Quan Stele and hang them on the lintel, but I have been busy making a living all day long, and haven't had time to write them well and hang them up, so there is a blank space in front of the door. As for inside the door, it is an irregularly shaped parallelogram cuboid, extending a large step and a quarter from left to right, and a large step and a sixth from the threshold to the back wall. Because the back wall was short of a few inches of space, the landlord had to make it slanted to avoid violating the "encroachment" laws, so my snail dwelling became an unequal-sided (or rather, forced, the box is stuffed into the gap just enough for the head of the bed, two baskets sleep under the cloth bed, and a pile of books is squeezed onto the self-made wooden bookshelf on the wall, under which is my desk and chair, slightly off-center from the window.</p>
<p>This is what the snail dwelling is like during the day. When I enter the door, my wife has to sit in the chair, and only after I sit on the cloth bed can my wife go out; when my wife comes in, I do the same. What about the little snail? Besides being placed on the bed to sit or lie down, it is taken to the alley. If the three snails are all in the "dwelling," the little snail curls up on the bed, and my wife and I sit separately on the chair and at the table. When the three snails move, either your head touches his chest, or his hand is at an unequal angle) quadrilateral frame. This is the general outline of the surroundings of the snail dwelling, as for under my feet, it is a good ocher-red floor, above my head is someone else's floor, and if my arms were a foot longer, I could reach up and climb.</p>
<p>I have two cloth beds, a box, two baskets, a writing desk, a chair, and a large pile of books. I am the male snail, my wife is the female snail, and there is also a little snail. Counting three snails of various sizes.</p>
<p>A cloth bed (along the bed) leans diagonally against the back wall, already occupying one-third of the snail dwelling, touching your arm.</p>
<p>At night, my wife and the little snail sleep on this bed against the back wall, where do I sleep? I must stretch my head or feet under the table on the floor, which is a bit stuffy, and the folding bed and chair are in the way. After thinking back and forth, I nailed a nail into the back wall and hung the chair on it, so the chair legs dragged down, more than a foot away from my wife and the little snail's bed. My wife's head often bumps into the chair legs when she sits up, but the space freed up by the chair is enough for me to set up another cloth bed. Before setting up the cloth bed, I must close the door of the snail dwelling tightly, because the cloth bed has to be placed across the back of the door. At this time, there is only a gap for one leg between my bed and my wife's bed, enough to grab the chamber pot or stand and fold and unfold the bed. So when I lie down, the snail dwelling is completely formed, because the entire room, except for a thin crack between the two beds, my head is against the table, my feet are against the wall, my wife's head is against the box, her feet are also against the wall, and the chair and wall bookshelf are hanging above. If I could also place something in the air, I would not only be the complete owner of the snail dwelling, but I am afraid I would also be the inventor of "saving space."</p>
<p>The opening and closing of the snail dwelling's door completely depends on my getting up and going to bed, so when friends come to me in the morning and evening, they can never enter.</p>
<p>In this way, hanging chairs, folding beds, and setting up beds, I have spent a year. Just like the people in those high-rise buildings and foreign-style villas, I have spent a year. Due to this snail-dwelling habit, I may have become a bit snail-like. I think it is an unforgivable sin for people to waste space and occupy other people's space.</p>
<p>I don't know if the "living space" in the mouths of Hitler and Mussolini is different from my living space, but I firmly believe that people who waste space must also be people who invade other people's space. I believe that no matter how greedy the invaders are, those who can survive will always have their due space. The invaders will certainly not occupy all the space, and the invaded will never be without a foothold for survival, just like the snail and I have always lived in this world. The only difference between my world and the snail's world is that I firmly believe that space should not be privately owned by anyone, and that there will inevitably be a day when space will still be public. But at that time, it will belong to the world of my and the snail's descendants. I happily look forward to it, yearning for it.</p>

<p>— Chen Peiying</p>
<p>The biggest difficulty for married women participating in social work is whether their husbands can cooperate, help, and encourage them. If we go to participate in social work, and after the work is completed, they cannot stay at home and go out to do evil, we would rather stay in the kitchen for the rest of our lives, and also ask our husbands to share or help with the household work. Now I am here to report on my half-social, half-family work situation. It can also be said to be a transitional life in a transitional era.</p>
<p>I am a commercial school graduate from a certain girls' school, and I have been married for many years. My husband is a clerk in a foreign firm and also an amateur painter. We have a daughter who is now studying in elementary school. In the morning, my husband and I cooperate on household chores. Sometimes he is very busy with painting, so I am responsible for everything alone. After eight o'clock, the three of us lock the door and leave at the same time, each going to our own office or classroom. We all return for lunch at half past noon, and lunch is cooked by my mother. After five o'clock in the afternoon, we return home one after another. My husband is always the first to arrive home. When he returns home, he brings back groceries to prepare for the big feast of dinner. Our breakfast and lunch are very casual, only dinner is more elaborate. We happily divide the work and cooperate, washing vegetables, rinsing rice, and washing bowls! We are busy and happy. But if he is very busy, then he does not participate in the kitchen work, but this is very rare. Although this life makes us extremely busy, we are very happy in spirit.</p>
<p>In short, for married women to participate in social work, the cooperation of their husbands is necessary. I myself am capable of enduring hardship and hard work, and I also need a reliable person to guard the house and deal with other miscellaneous tasks, otherwise it would just be pie in the sky.</p>

<p>Chapter 10 The Shoe Problem</p>
<p>When I asked Jinmei to tell the facts about Li Shouqi, Jinmei still had a small, roundabout performance. She walked to the desk, bent over, and gently pulled up a corner of the perforated curtain with her hand, looking outside, as if this conversation was very secret, fearing that Li Zifan would return and overhear it, causing trouble. Then she returned to the round table, and her face also showed a cautious expression. I pointed to the other leather-cushioned chair, and she slowly sat down.</p>
<p>She said in a low voice: "Sir, this young master Li is indeed a bit suspicious, but I really dare not say. Now that Miss Wang is dead, Mr. Li seems to be the master here. If he knows that I am talking about his son, then I definitely won't be able to handle it. Sir, this matter is too important. If you cannot guarantee me, I still dare not say."</p>
<p>I immediately replied: "Don't worry, just say it. As long as your words are completely true, no one can make things difficult for you. Tell me, what happened with Li Shouqi?"</p>
<p>Jinmei's gaze was fixed on me, paused for a moment, and suddenly said: "He wanted to rape Miss Wang!" After she said this, she hurriedly averted her gaze and moved it to the window, as if very frightened.</p>
<p>This sentence certainly couldn't help but surprise me, but I still maintained a calm demeanor. I replied: "Don't be afraid, even if Li Zifan comes back, it doesn't matter. Tell me in more detail. He came on the seventeenth, what happened after he came?"</p>
<p>Jinmei calmed herself down and said, "As soon as he arrived here, Miss Wang saw him, and everyone's faces looked bad. After he had lunch, Miss Wang talked with him here. The voice of the conversation was very low, and the time was very long. I once brought tea in, and Miss Wang immediately told me to go out and locked the door. So I didn't hear anything about what they talked about. Later, that person surnamed Zhao came, and Miss Wang hurriedly rushed out to stop him, not letting the person surnamed Zhao come in.</p>
<p>"They talked for a full two hours, and everyone's throats were hoarse. Fortunately, Mr. Li knocked on the door and came in to persuade them. Mr. Li also joined the conversation, and they talked for a long time before Miss Wang angrily opened the door and went upstairs." (145)</p>

<p>Since Mei Lanfang retired to Hong Kong, Shang Xiaoyun's fame and fortune in the Liyuan world of the old capital have almost surpassed those of Cheng Yanqiu and Xun Huisheng. Both Mei and Cheng had organized troupes to conquer overseas lands. Before the war, Xiaoyun had repeatedly and earnestly requested a certain important figure in the old capital to find a way to follow in the footsteps of Mei and Cheng to travel abroad. Not long after, the war broke out, and it was abandoned. Therefore, Xiaoyun privately talked to people, often citing the failure of this event as a regret. Now, the news has come that Xiaoyun has decided to travel to the East to perform next month! "Where there is a will, there is a way!" For Shang, his wish has been fulfilled, but an old clown, upon learning of this, said with sigh: "It's not the right time, it's not the right time!"</p>
<p>(19)</p>
<p>Xun Lingxiang, one of the five famous young dan performers, is very diligent. In addition to seeking advice from the old master Wang Yaoqing, he has also learned a good hand at flower painting, and he is also quite well-known in the art world of the old capital. The painting teacher is the famous painter Liu Xiyong from the old capital. People say, "Huisheng has a successor."</p>
<p>(20)</p>
<p>Yan Jupeng is full of complaints. A few years ago, someone said to him: "Now it's popular to do things recklessly. If you perform a few operas tomorrow, you might catch up with Xi Cailian"? At that time, Xi Cailian had just arrived in Peking and was singing very popularly. Jupeng smiled silently after hearing this and said, "I will change my name to Yan Cailian tomorrow." Then, he jokingly quipped: "People spin cotton, I pick up waste paper, and then I will change it to picking up light bulbs. Actually, when I perform female roles, how small you look at the beginning, but it becomes pleasing to the eye when you look closely!"</p>

<p>Zhu Qinxin is good at spending money. One year in Tianjin, during the sweltering summer heat, a certain fruit store had just transported several American cantaloupes by plane from the sea. Zhu bought one for more than twelve yuan, and while eating, she said, "The taste is not much different from the ones here." Before she could eat even half of it, she threw it away casually.</p>

<p>Before Hao Shouchang retired, he often liked to cross-dress, and the roles he played were always graceful female characters. In 1924, Xu Biyun and Tan Fuying cross-dressed in Wax Temple in the old capital's Huale. Hao Shouchang and Ma Liankun, two Jing actors, simultaneously played Xiao Zhang Ma and Zhang Guilan. When Xiao Zhang Ma removed Zhang Guilan's veil, Hao said in a Sanhe dialect: "Oh! I thought it was who? Turns out it's also a painted face." The audience burst into thunderous applause.</p>

<p>Will Film "Locusts and Ants" Again</p>
<p>Since Walt Disney's "Snow White" was introduced to our country, the general audience who love cartoon films have undoubtedly expressed a deeper appreciation. Indeed, if we believe that movies can educate society, then cartoon films are indeed very effective in this regard, especially among women and children.</p>
<p>Our country has paid little attention to cartoon films due to insufficient equipment, so the Wan brothers (Laiming and Guchan) have worked hard on cartoon work for more than ten years, but they have still failed to attract the interest of the general public. Until the spring of this year, the Guolian Film Company established a cartoon department. The authorities had long admired their reputation, so they hired them to preside over the direction of the project. Therefore, China's first full-length cartoon "Princess Iron Fan" began filming under their plan.</p>
<p>Now, after working for more than four months, it is almost entirely successful. After two months of dubbing, editing, and various necessary processes, it can begin to be presented to the audience. Of course, it will definitely be warmly supported by thousands of people.</p>
<p>In "Princess Iron Fan," although the title seems to contain elements of gods and monsters, the content is very much aimed at the great era, explaining that before the pursuit of light, one must go through untold hardships. Therefore, in the second film, the theme will be greatly enriched. At present, the working title is "Locusts and Ants," including the survival dynamics of all animals in the universe, but the problem to be considered is how to incorporate the meaning of the times.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Shirley Temple Stars in "The Blue Bird" <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>

<p>"The Blue Bird" is the lifelong immortal masterpiece of the Belgian literary giant Maurice Maeterlinck. The translation has spread all over the world, recited by hundreds of millions of people. Its rich interest, rich imagination, profound meaning, and tight structure make it worthy of being the most moving fairy tale in the world. Before Shirley Temple left the screen, Fox Company specially spent a huge sum of money to solemnly film it, with Temple playing the protagonist Mytyl in the film, and with famous actors such as Schell Bercuson co-starring. The huge scenes in the film are extremely magical and gorgeous, and the entire film is filmed in five colors, which is truly dazzling. No wonder, when it was screened in the United States, general public opinion held that its artistic achievements far surpassed "Snow White." It is indeed a good film worthy of appreciation this week. The attached picture is a scene from the film, which will be shown at the Great Light Theater starting Thursday.</p>

<p>(1) The first work of the Yu family, "Confucius," which has attracted much attention, has been completely completed. In order to celebrate the success of the film, the company has specially published a large-format illustrated magazine, a special issue of Confucius, which is magnificent and will be published on November 10th. The price is one yuan, and the advance order is eight cents. Minhua Company, Daxiao Company, and China Book Company can all subscribe. (2) MGM Film Company's biographical films of Edison, "Young Tom Edison" and "Edison the Man," are both great works of this year. There is a special issue of Edison, edited by Xu Baiyi, which has been published. In addition to detailed stories of the two films, there is also much valuable material. The entire book is 20 pages in size, with exquisite printing. All newsstands sell it for four cents.</p>

<p>— Ling Bai</p>
<p>In Lafayette's "Mother Goner"</p>
<p>Liu Qiong is undoubtedly the leading young actor in the film industry today. At the same time, he is also a strong general in the stage drama world. I remember last winter, the Shanghai Drama Society performed "Remnants of the Late Ming Dynasty" (which is Wei Ruhui's "Flowers of Loyalty" in this newspaper's Spring and Autumn section). He was the lead actor Zheng Chenggong, because the character in the play is full of慷慨激昂 and impassioned spirit, which formally matches his personality, so he immediately won the unanimous praise of thousands of audiences.</p>
<p>Under the principle of disaster relief, the New Arts Society's drama performance of "Zheng Chenggong, Hero of the Seas" was for one week, and the lead role in the play was still invited to him. Of course, under his rough style, the acting was also very successful.</p>
<p>October is called the historical drama season. Therefore, after "The Biography of the Righteous Martyrs of the Great Ming Dynasty", the Drama Society plans to perform last year's great work "Remnants of the Late Ming Dynasty". The lineup is quite strong. Among them, because Liu Qiong's Zheng Chenggong had made a deep impression on people in last year's performance, the society still welcomed his participation. Of course, under the condition of taking art as the premise, he did not feel tired because he had already performed "Hero of the Seas" for a week, but was very excited and resolutely took on the role. Yes, after the military performance of "Remnants of the Late Ming Dynasty", the entire drama world will once again cause a sensation.</p>

<p>— Dongyun Writes, Xiuyan Illustrates</p>
<p>(7) Great Tang Recognizes Wife</p>
<p>There is a play in Peking Opera called "The Three Courts Joint Trial", in which the female prisoner below the steps is the judge's lover from many years ago. Now this play, "Great Tang Recognizes Wife", is equally coincidental; the female prisoner below the steps is the judge's bedfellow.</p>
<p>What is truly a coincidence is that both of these judges who made a joke in the hall share the same surname, Wang, and their given names also happen to have the character "Long"; one is called Wang Jinlong, and the other is called Wang Wenlong. No wonder the two confused gentlemen mistook Wang Wenlong for Wang Jinlong's older brother (Wang Wenlong is performed by an old man, while Wang Jinlong is a young man), and said that they were "brothers in distress", a laugh. (See picture)</p>
<p>(8) Book of Mutual Scolding</p>
<p>"Book of Mutual Scolding" is performed purely in a comedic form, with two "scolding street" "shrews" competing with each other on stage. "Mutual scolding" is a woman's masterpiece. The characters appearing in the play are "Girl Nine Pounds" and "Aunt Three Pounds." The art of "mutual scolding" is very advanced, with sharp words and no one yielding. "Mutual scolding" seems to be a very annoying thing; however, the charming women of Yue occasionally perform it, not only is it not annoying, but it turns out to be a clever and moving tongue.</p>
