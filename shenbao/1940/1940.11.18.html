<p>昨日報載路透社十六日東京電稱：「都新聞今日社論謂星期三舉行之御前會議，雖所議定辦法的內容。尙未切實宣布，然對於中國事件之解決。度必已有若干進展。重慶最好在日本正式承認南京新政府以前，考慮和平云云。對於國際政治具有濃厚興趣的人們，決不輕易看過這一電訉。視回雲烟過眼；雖此報此言的本質、也許在實際的國際政治上還不如烟雲。</p>
<p>吾們不願成見的對於此報此言。視若無覩，聽而小聞。然此報今所期待於中國國民政府者，旣不能遽視爲此報確知了星期三日本御前會議內容，始採取此態度，申述其願望；又不能遽視此項願望態度，乃爲日本有力方面的有力輿情；更不能遽視爲日本當局假手於此報。對國民政府作此表示，意在試探。因此，此報此言還不夠吸引任何人的多大重視。要予重視，除非謂這是試探；若是試探，祗有中國國民政府方面或有以任何方式予以答復的義務。這不是我們的事。</p>
<p>我們對此——或可謂爲無端的，竟然感念不絕。第一，日本對華發動了武力侵略之後，到處見得獷悍不顧一切，然對於本年三月底以後的南京局面，日本並未輕率承認；這一矜持。吾們嘗稱許之爲粗中帶細，尙屬鄭重：猶憶四月下旬，東京特派阿部到南京。我們就旁觀所見，嘗向阿部進言，略謂一無效的訂的簽字，並不能使日本所得更多，使中國所失更多，却使將來日本在糾正謬誤的時候，爲了顏面，增加了一種不必要的顧慮，而減少及早糾正謬誤的勇氣與機會」；時間倐忽的又過了六七個月而至現在。阿部據說旣得成議而悄然歸去了，根據了隔昨都新聞所言，似乎日本方面還能依然矜持、而站住於四月下旬時候的三叉路口。亦即迄今尙未輕率的決心走絕路。第二，誰說誰竟好戰好殺而小好和平？若說自己，這是對自己的欺罔；若責他人，這是對他人的誣蔑；何况在久戰大殺之後！然而和平究竟不是國際人生的第一義，倘若以和不和判別禍福則誰主不和，倘若以戰不戰判別生死則誰甘不戰？日本對華作戰到了現階段，無論其爲主觀愛好，無論其爲客觀條件，千誠萬誠的謀得和平，這是吾們所千信萬信，然而日方禍福論下的和平主張怎能折服中國生死存亡論下的抗戰決心？現在日方將中國國族的生死存亡問題扔在烟雲縹緲之中，而向中國追求和平，請中國考慮和平，這小是自私自利的愚蠢舉動、便是愚蠢至於自喪其謀和誠意於不知不識之中。第三，中國自信愈戰愈强，自信必勝，且務必勝；但在中國總反攻的實力培養完成之前，乃至於獲得發動總反攻的機會之前，我們得平心靜氣的承認中日兩國間和戰關鍵操持於日本，待決於日本；質言之，日本祇要自動糾正其侵略政策，撒回其侵略軍隊以及其他侵略機構，則戰事富然立即消弭，和平當然立即實現；然則所謂希望重慶考慮和平，豈非顚倒了因果，根本是錯覺？第四，所謂『最好在日本正式承認南京新政府之前」云云。關於這一契機的提示，我們願爲日本作善意的打算而指陳之爲日方應目鄭重，一如前述四月下旬所論；然而亦祇有如日本方面的錯覺，纔會誤認此爲有何了不得關係的重要契機。一因爲承認與吾，承認的正式與吾，乃至訂約簽字與吾，絕不能使中日兩國間事實上存在的戰事，因此而增減其性質的重輕。伸縮其事態的大小，損益其解決的機會。二因爲相對的。東京扶翼南京，事屬無人不曉，而東京以爲予以承認便是有力扶翼，獨不知道出入全不在此；要知東京所取愈少。南京所得愈多。纔有扶翼的實益；日本在中國無所取，南京始得在中國有可爲。三是絕對的。中國國民政府所領導的抗戰，南京方面所主張的和平，雖得以中外字典所有的字與辭，說明其間的絕異；然以「中日兩國能吾停止戰爭，實現和平？」問題爲尺度，則在絕不欺罔，絕不曲解的嚴格條件，嚴肅前提之下，其答案却絕同。何以言之？國民政府之所以領導抗戰，中國國民之所以擁戴國民政府領導抗戰，要在保全主權領土的完整，爭取國族的獨立自由，得之則恢復和平，不得則繼續抗戰；這是絕對的。至於南京方面，由所謂和平途徑，必須確確實實的辦到了主權領土的完整，辦到了國族的獨立自由，則中日兩國的戰爭當然不復存在，南京也就一切成功了。中日也就一切解決了；這些絕對條件而事實上不能確實辦到，則事實上無法停止戰爭，亦即事實上無法實現和平。事理太準確而淺顯了，正式承認與吾，祇是東京南京間的這麼一回事；對中日兩國大局，成何契機？成何重要契機？「都新聞」所言，假定是試探，可以想見國民政府決不視此爲問題，即以東京南京論，事實上所爭亦豈在此？</p>

<p>這篇是分析法蘭西大悲劇中第二位主角卽聯軍總司令甘茂林將軍的個性。原文亦出法國名作家裘羅曼手筆，載美國曰星期六晚報」，茲迻譯於後：</p>
<p>有人說，經濟須是漸進的纔有價値。果爾，我和將領們相處的經騐，缺乏循序前進，可就不足深道了。</p>
<p>許多年來，我除以前充當小兵時所學得的經騐而外，可說是一無所得。當小兵的，看到步兵軍曹，就口爲了不得，對面雖不致侷促不安，總不無敬畏之心。看上尉就如遙遠的山峯，可望而不可卽。至於將領，更如天上神龍，無從窺測了。</p>
<p>且說我自從和步兵軍曹相往還以後，與我接觸的第一個軍官就是魏剛，當時是個陸軍總監，戰時就可以做總司令。那時離現在還小到七年。</p>
<p>那天我友宴客，魏剛和我同席。他疑我是左派人物，主人立卽解釋，說我絕非左派，不過胸無城府，事事都感覺興趣罷了。</p>
<p>餐畢，祗有我們兩個人留在花園，因得私下談話。他頗具儒將之風，彬彬有禮，和藹可親，迥異一班普通將校。他的溫文爾雅，猶如少女，實則就是女子中恐怕也難得我出這般人物哩！</p>
<p>寒暄方畢，我就直捷問他下决大戰中空軍地位如何。讀者不要誤會，以爲我有先見之明。其實只因我平時好讀報章雜誌上的專家作品，耳濡目染旣久，自然脫口而出，那些作家們相率以爲空軍的進步，已使現代戰爭爲之一變，兵多不足恃，所恃者唯有空軍。義大利杜黑將軍的空軍理論，徵引者允多。法國政治家中允多主張，與其延長微軍制，不如節省金錢，創迭無敵空軍。就是左派和極左派持此論的，亦實繁有徒。另外有人警吿，德國因無權建造軍用飛機，乃轉向巨型商用飛機着手，一旦有事，便可改作轟炸機之用。</p>
<p>那時魏剛　軍用愼重的語氣答道：「這種觀念固然母容忽視。但空軍不足以決定戰爭的勝敗。要把握勝利，必須佔領陣地，這一點空軍休說目前，永遠也不能做到」。</p>
<p>他又說到空軍如何需要離開火綫不遠的根據地，以及因之而產生的種種限制。</p>
<p>他雖沒有說明步兵始終是「戰爭的驕子」，也不提什麼陳腐套辭。但他不信近代機械化設備足以革新戰術戰略，已是溢於言表。</p>
<p>同日，魏剛與他客接談，說他不久將屆退伍之年，但殊不願戀棧，他說靑年軍官晋級的規章，根本甚好。</p>
<p>魏剛年事雖高，却依然是容貌整飭，精神充足，筋骨强壯，有許多壯年男子怕還够不上。看他躍馬馳騁，瞬息數十里，更使人欣羨小止。</p>
<p>所以在握別之際，我很欽佩他的爲人，可是我暗中希望他不要有絲毫的騎兵色彩」纔好。</p>
<p>一九一四年時，有些將領不知輕重，以爲用騎兵衝鋒縱橫馳突，不難掃蕩遐邇馳名的德軍重砲隊。所謂「騎兵色彩」，就是我譏諷那班將領的一句俏皮話。</p>
<p>此後不久，忽有人來訪，此於法國後日的遭際不無意義，這事當在一九三四年的下半年。</p>
<p>客人名第德萊中校，是魏剛將軍的親信，手携雜誌一冊，內載一文，卽第德萊所著。他說：「只要你一時高興，不妨貢獻一點意見，他無不樂意接受」。題名「新軍論」，筆墨思想，皆有可觀。我一向不知道他的命意何在，最近纔明白過米。原來特戈爾將軍的名著正在一九三四年出版。當時知者甚少，我也不曾聽釗過有這樣一本書，但在軍界頗引起注意。後來我讀過這書，纔知道第特萊中校（續者要記得，他是魏剛將軍的心腹）所著一文，完全是針對特戈爾而發，並指摘特戈爾的主張，說編練專門化的職業軍隊，俾於必要時，用以單獨作戰，頗具危險性</p>
<p>按下魏剛不表，下文再說甘茂林。</p>
<p>我第一次碰、甘茂林，是在那一天，那一處，已經記憶不淸。我大概祇在塲酬酌中和他會面，第一次也許就在宴會時遇到他的吧！</p>
<p>戰雲瀰漫之際，每個留心和戰問題的人，看到國家命運所繫的最高將領，不免要另眼看待。和我友善的各部長又屢屢提及，在千鈞一髮之時，總參謀部的意見，影響國策甚巨。例如一九三六年希特勒進兵萊茵，當時法國內閣分爲兩派，一派主張實力對付，另一派主張沉機觀變，及至總參謀部一言，紛爭遂決。總參謀部說：「假使眞要到萊茵去，就非總動員不可。我們旣無遠征軍隊，又不會撤豆成兵。」內閣因此躊躇，以爲決不能動員五百萬人去担任這簡單的警察工作。</p>
<p>待戈爾早在兩年前出版一書，力主編練常備遠征軍團的重要，並曾說明法國就因缺乏此種實力，遇難只圖苟安，坐視和平逐漸不保，直至被迫牽入漩渦，不得不在最惡劣的環境下作戰，始覺追悔奐及。特戈爾的意見旣爲總參謀部所漠視，萊茵事件的敎訓，也不能引起他們的注意。危險一過，他們又事過境遷，把建設遠征軍計劃的迫切需要置諸腦後，明知議會不會留難，也不肯提付討論了。</p>
<p>為這許多原因，只要我有幸遇見甘茂林，不論飯前飯後，總要設法和他攀談幾句。</p>
<p>甘茂林爲人謙和，且多風趣，可說沒有人比得上。他總是十分安閒自在，你一同他接觸，他就會立刻使你覺得一樣的安閒，假使你記不起第一决和他見面之時，那是因爲他不論舊雨新知，總是一見如故，假使你和他闊別數月，再和他握手道舊，他總是像天天和你談話那樣的慇懃。假使你和他同時出室，他總是讓你先走，除非你堅執不肯，他纔勉强先行，臉上帶着微笑，似乎是說：「也罷，這是我們老年人的權利吧！」他身村不高不矮，體格中等，皮膚紅潤細緻，兩眼活潑靈警，但頗和善，髮軟而稀少，顏色微赤。嘴上蓄着兩撇短鬚，額上皺紋尙還不多。他外貌鎮靜，藏而不露。身體並不十分强健。談吐雋永，音調悅耳，別人說話的時候，他總是凝神靜聽，不揷嘴，不反駁。像這一位不輕觸犯他人的人，你一見定然認爲意見相投。只是他似乎具有魔力，你談到末了，不知道自己的說話已經使他聽了滿意，還不知道他已在無形之中把你說服了。</p>
<p>一天，我以德國軍隊的備戰情形問他。</p>
<p>他答道：「德國果然十分努力，效果亦非沒有。只是舊部已經解散，徵兵尙待實施在這靑黃不接時期，訓練方面的缺點，很難補救。」</p>
<p>他也談到德國缺少訓練有素的軍官，特別是一班下級軍官，一時無法造就。他又以爲德國高級幹部和總參謀部的傳統關係，已經分裂，因着軍隊的政治革新，而愈見尖銳化。</p>
<p>「我想德軍中現役將校，曾在一九一四年至一九一八年大戰中參預戎機的，恐是寥寥無幾，而我軍將領，幾全是一九一四年的師團長，像這種經騐宏富眞是難能可貴。」</p>
<p>後來談鋒轉到空軍，他只輕描淡寫地幾句，便把這個問題撇開。他說法國現尙在過渡時期，我們必須急起直追。他言外之意，透露着他的不負這責任，似乎說：「錯誤疏忽，都是與我無干。」</p>
<p>他從沒有談起過陸軍的設備。但他似乎很覺滿意，他的謹愼，似吏可以使人放心。我從未見過他有何表示，或是沉默，或是歎息，可以感覺他似乎要說：「我本有許多話，不過—」或是說：「你旣然和輿論界及閣員們都很接近，你可驚醒他們，說我們缺少必要的物質，若不趕緊努力，必致貽禍無窮。」他總是一個聲色不動</p>
<p>他難得談起本人，也不談論過去。別人却喜講他，把他獎譽備至。上决大戰起後，甘茂林自始至終，在霞飛將軍的幕下，可說是一個最不出名而最有本領的人才，深得霞飛將軍的信任。據說，草擬馬爾緬河一役的進兵方略，而促霞飛將軍下令反攻的就是甘茂林。他在上决世界大戰中建的功續，在在顯出他的才能應變，審愼知機。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c56">商號存款及內匯問題 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— 李江</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>報載上海市高會暨銀錢兩業公會奉財部訓令，嚴禁普通商號兼營吸收存款或辦理兌後，業已通告會員各業公會暨各銀行錢莊一體遵照辦理，並獎勵舉發從嚴究辦雲雲，此項政令之涵義實為當前之資金問題，頗有值得討論者。</p>
<p>自八一三戰事內移後，滬上人口密集，各地銀行紛紛撤退滬濱，復因歐西時局不靖，海外資金，群向滬流，於是此一國際性之自由市場遂成為資金集中之所。然在另一方面，滬市之工商業正陷於畸形狀態之中，投資對象僅限於中小商業，值茲時局變幻不定之時，孰願作固定性之投資，於是上海資金遂有苦無出路之感，市面遊資，大見充斥，結果形成各種投資蓬勃之現象。在此現象之中，且更發生各種金融上不正常之發展。此處所論之商號吸收存款及辦理匯兌，即其一種。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>普通商號之兼營存款業務本屬淵源甚遠，特在今日較昔為甚是已。查民國二十年所公布之銀行法中，第一條即曾規定，凡經營存款·放款·匯況或貼現票據各項業務之一者，即為銀行，其不用銀行名稱者，視同銀行。今普通商號即兼營存款業務，自當受各種金融法規之轄制。該法公布後，雖因種種關係未能付諸實施，但一般較大商家利導，特撥一筆資金附銀行一部，專司存款事宜（若滬上某大公司即為一例），但自滬上發生遊資問題之後，投機囤積之風日盛，衹須設法籌得資金，購藏貨物，一轉手間即可坐獲巨利，是以一般商家競相籌款，而拉攏存款亦為商家籌款之一法。故戰時普通商號存款業務之發達，亦可謂為遊資過剩投機勃興下附帶產生之現象。此種現象，吾人認為實有取締之必要。</p>
<p>第一，財部為增強金融統制之力量起見，最近曾頒布非常時期管理銀行暫行辦法，該法第一條即曾重申銀行法中之規定，凡經營收受存款及放款·票據貼現·匯況或押款各項業務之一而不稱銀行者，視同銀行。按此規定，吸收存款之商號，當亦為銀行之一種，則其設立自當遵照各種金融法規向經·財·兩部呈請註冊，然事實上此等商號自有其本身之業務，初不能改組為銀行，吸收存款不過為其金融週轉之手段耳。因此，吸收存款之商號不能受各種金融法規之監督，存戶利益當不能獲得可靠之保障。</p>
<p>第二，在非常時期管理銀行暫行辦法中，曾規定銀行連用存款以投資生產建設事業及聯合產銷事業為原則，並不得直接經營商業或囤積貨物。但商家吸收存款後，根本即係直接經營商業，而且吾人亦無法知其運用之途徑，更無法防其利用此項存款作投機囤貨之行為，值茲投機囤貨之風極盛之時，吾人實不能不防患於未然而制止遊資之步入於不正當之途徑。</p>
<p>第三，又按管理銀行暫行辦法中第二條之規定，銀行經收存款除儲蓄存款應照儲蓄銀行法辦理外，其普通存款應以所收存款額百分之二十為準備金，轉存當地中·中·交·農四行任何一行，並由收存行給以適當存息。考其用意，不外（一）在保障存戶之安全，緊急時不致發生擠提風潮，（二）在制止商業銀行中資金不正當之運用，（三）增強國家銀行控制信用之力量。今普通商號之吸收存款者，事實上既不能作為銀和地而論，則自不能適用上項之規定，易言之，推其結果，亦即削弱政府控制市場之力量。</p>
<p>基於上述理由，則對於商號之吸收存款，宜乎其財部頒布訓令嚴格取締矣。</p>
<p>唯就實隙地情形言，姑不論政府之權力是否得全能及於上海，商家吸收存款實不易完全禁絕。蓋商號所吸收之存款，大多基於私人情感之關係，外人實無法干涉之，此為一。商號所吸收之存款，利率常較銀行為高，何況目下各銀行正有減低存息之舉首？此為二。即使有人出而舉發，但商號可在會計科目上設法朦混，例如明明為存款科目，為欲避免存款名詞計，不妨改之為借入金或其他名稱之科目，一轉變間，即可避去立法之干涉，此為三。有此三因，財部訓令容或不易辦到，因此，尚有一事吾人似應加以研究焉。</p>
<p>目下滬市各銀行正在發動存款減息運動，部份銀行且已正式實施，推其理由，心痛所收存款之中，其為活期者竟占百分之七十，銀行收入此項資金後，既苦於缺少投資之對象，且固定之投資，因此，除將此項資金亦作投機性之運用外，唯有坐耗利息而增加本身之負擔，於是不得不有減息之辦法。唯據吾人之意見，減息辦法適為給予商家吸收存款之機會。吾人認為活存息固不妨稍予降低，但定存息則不特不應降低，目反應有提高之必要。蓋活期存款既占總存款百分之七十，則唯一要圖，當在改變存款之性質，將活存能夠設法轉之為定存，故而減低活存息提高定存不失為增加定存辦法之一種。定　存款　果能大量增加，銀行當可運用此項辦法吸收一部份遊資轉投放於內地，同時兼可防止遊資之為普通商號吸收矣。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>上年秋間，政府內欲限制資金之流滬，曾有四行內匯審核處之組織，前乎此者，並早已限制內地款項匯滬，並曾規定匯滬款項之最高數額。今年三月，復頒布便利內匯暫行辦法，大旨有三，（一）由口岸泯往內地者，免費，（二）內地與內地間照部定匯率通匯，（三）由內地匯口岸者限於部定日用必須品之款，，並須經四行內匯審核處審核。然而，滬市對於內地之貿易為出超，加以其他資金逃等種種原因，內地之暗款至滬者，為數極钜，因此乃發生內匯之暗市，在上海則更有所謂費匯款之情事，而一般普通商號　多登諸報端公開招攬匯款。</p>
<p>普通商家若能輔助金融機關促進資金內移，原為政府所歡迎，即就實際情形言，商家經營貼費匯款亦自有其理由，蓋商家將貨物裝運內地後，因貨款亦自有其理由，蓋商家將貨物裝運內地後，因貨款之不易匯出，故在滬辦理貼費匯款純為出乎　頭寸之動機，事實上客商且早有互相軋帳之積習，其軋帳後不能相平之差額始交由銀行代為匯況也。此固亦具有相當理由，特細加分析，今日情形實有未盡然者，政府獎勵貼費匯款往內地者，係指獎勵止當之商業銀行，並非指特殊之商號。貼費匯款固屬個人自由，但既經刊諸報端公開羅致，則其範圍已非僅限之於兩地客商，對於社會影響，必將甚大，按上述管理銀行暫行辦法之規定，商號既營匯況業務，即當視同銀行，其業務遂須府受財部之監督，以保障顧客之安全，今普　商家經營貼費匯款，既不受金融法規之轄制，其業務及財政狀況自不易為外人所明瞭。同時，一般人之欲匯內地者，本可交由銀行代為匯出，藉使滬市減少一筆數目之遊資，今受商號高價貼費之引誘而舍正當金融機關於不顧，是不管流向內地之資金橫遭若　商家之截扣。至調調撥頭寸以維持營業，固盡可以合法手續向內地內匯審核處申請，問題當可解決，固不必另創別法擅自經營金融業務也。此殆為此次財部訓令嚴禁普通商號經營匯兌之意欵？</p>
<p>於此吾人有一問題應加考慮者，商家既不能經營匯款業務，則其滯留內地之款遂無法匯返上海矣。影響所及，一般商家勢將發生週轉不靈之痛苦，而上海貨物亦難望其輸入內地矣。職是之故，四行內匯審核處對於正當必需品之　　　應從實審核給予匯兌之便利，甚至根據　物之性質而允予一部份匯款之便利，庶幾為兼顧政令民情之辦法欸。</p>
<h3 id="c57">關於金庫券計劃 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— 劉錫章</p>
<p>自幣制改革以後，關於發行金庫券之說，隨時在市上發現，大約市場每經某項變更，則此項計劃即須流行一次。最近因受某方設立「銀行」流言之激動，此項風說又盛行起來，且據傳說此中計劃，為：（一）金庫券以金幣為單位，（二）每一金庫券等於法幣四元，（三）金庫券對美匯兌為每百元對美十六元，（四）此項計畫實現後則法幣將不能結購外匯。認為此說可信者的意見，以為假定某方的「銀行」成立之後，必定將發行不兌換紙幣，又必然用此種不兌換的「紙」幣，來調換法幣的外匯，即為法幣外匯之兌現，因此政府不能不採用金庫券方法來抵制之。</p>
<p>這是一個風說，實際上不值得討論的，這裏所要討論的，是在假設立場上。假定中國政府真的頒佈了「金庫券條例」，則此種計劃會不會對於　在金融情形有所影響？這種計畫的評價是怎樣的？</p>
<p>「發行金庫券」一件事，可以作兩種解釋，一種可以說是國家新發行的一種金公債，一種可以解釋為幣制的改革，我們假定是後者。</p>
<p>最初，我們得把中國現行的外匯政策加以約略的介紹。法幣可以自由兌付外匯，這確是法幣政策中之一個罅隙，此種罅隙的可能存在，主要還是因為上海外匯市場的存在，而政府沒有方法控制它。同時，政府方面所以允許計暗市存在，照我們推測，大概是為了增強法幣在外的信用，可是為要防止資金的逃避，其勢又不能不採取嚴格的外匯管理方策，因此，現行的外匯制度，化為兩種平行的辦法：（一）外匯政策原則上是採取管理政策的，進出口匯兌都受政府的嚴格統制，其匯率是暫時放棄對英一先令二辦士半的官價，而用中交兩行的掛牌匯率。（二）對於被佔據區域中，主要為上海，因為中央政令暫時不能全權控制，其匯價聽其自由上落，而於可能範圍加以適當的調整。這兩點是我們現行的外匯最大骨幹。因此，在中國政府直接管理下的匯市，其匯率是絕對平衡的，一　人常認為變動不定的匯率，係指上海的匯率。一般人所現為外匯資源容易被攫取的匯市，也是指暗市。</p>
<p>明瞭這兩點，我們雖然不知道政府有否所謂金庫券計劃，但金庫券計劃的實施，卻可以斷定不會對現行的政策有什麼稗補。從內地言，匯率本來是絕對穩定，發行金庫券與否，實與內地匯價的無關。因為這是形式上的變更，不是實體上的變更。如其說發行金庫券目的是對付暗市，假定照上述傳說，每四元法幣等於一個金庫券，則金庫券每百元對美為十六元，法幣每百元就等於為對美四元。法幣的匯率仍然存在。如其說到那時候，祇有金庫券能夠自由購買外匯，而法幣不能，則政府祇要取消暗市的維持政策，就可以達到上項目的，並不須經過發行金庫券的階段。總之，縱使沒有金庫券，政府已可以絕對管理外匯的外流：而在上海，則即使另外發行金庫券，也不能禁止外匯暗市的法幣買賣。試問金庫券是不是將流到上海來？如其祇流行內地，則內地根本不需要，如其流行在上海，則與法幣又有何異，就使政府立刻放棄維持暗市政策，則法幣的買賣在上海還是可以有。舉一個例，例如英鎊鈔票，英國政府已經下令收回，但上海的英鎊鈔票，英國政府已經下令收回，但上海的英鎊鈔票對法幣的匯價還是有的。雖然，法幣是中國通貨，而英鎊為外國通貨，情形不同。可是在現階優的上海特殊環境中，我們拿英鎊何票做例子，事實上是很適合的。試問英國如果發行一種金庫券，會舉動對現行英鎊政策有什麼影響呢？一個通貨政策的轉變是在實質，不在名義，這是最基礎的論據。</p>
<p>依我們的理想，自然是希望政府能夠直接控制，上海的外匯暗市，使外匯資源一點一滴盡歸國有，而不會有，搜取之虞。至於目前外匯暗市所以不能消滅，實行是因為政府不能直接控制上海暗市。因為不能控制，不能消滅，所以金庫券的有無，不能增強目前外匯政策的權能，這是可以斷言的。</p>
<p>至於將來假定有「紙」幣的發行，無疑是對民眾是一種掠奪，有資產的人的保護方法，祇有把法幣匯到內地去，才可以獲得最安全的保障。</p>
<p>金庫券計劃祇有一個可能，那就是在政府通盤計畫安定匯市的時候。假定一個政府在戰爭結束以後，認為　貨應該另外成立了一個標准，才會在流行通貨之外另外的假設一個單位。譬如蘇俄從前在一九二二年就會曾經用柴夫奈茲（Chervoonet）來整理金盧布，其比率定每十個盧布等於一個柴夫奈茲。如果在目前的中國，則金庫券計畫在事實上並沒有什麼需要。根據了政府明施行的外匯政策，我們已可發見一個線索，可以知道政府在戰後，必然採用一定標準來安定匯市的。我們今日不是有二個官定匯價嗎？為什麼政府在法定匯率之外。另外設立一個中交掛呢？就我們推測，法價是不變的，而中交掛牌可是變的，目前，政府是用中交掛牌作應急的調整，到了一定的時候，換句話說，是到了可以　能控制匯市的時候，那時候才時考慮法價的時候，或提高，或貶低，或不變。所謂金庫券計劃，最後的觀察不外是如此。</p>
<p>但是金庫券　說為什麼只是流　在市場上呢？就我們推測，不外是：（一）惡意者造謠，使淺識者誤認法幣政策必須更變，因而動搖其對法幣信仰。（二）或許有這們一個整理戰後貨幣的計劃，但僅乎是一種建議，此種建議，或許出諸私人，或許出諸專家，而市上則無中生有，改變事實。</p>
<p>這一篇文字研討立場，還有在「假定」身上。然而根本上我們認為此種風說，在投機市場上或許會感到幾分趣味，在整個幣制立場上，是沒有研討餘地的，因為　論有或無，都不會更變中國通貨的本質。</p>
<h3 id="c58">法租界計電法 <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— 嘉謨</p>
<p>上期本刊登載黃雲千君的電費計算法，是完全根據本市公共租界美商上海電力公司的價目來釋明；但是和本市法租界的法商水電公司價目，並不相同。茲特報告一下法商水電的計算法。</p>
<p>法商水電公司的量電，是用愛多瓦特小時Ｈwh度數來計算；（俗稱小字）和上海電力公司用基羅情瓦特小時Kwh度數計算，（俗稱大字）單位上已各不相同。（因為十度愛多瓦特，　等於一度基羅瓦特。）所以電燈用電每一度原價計銀祇一分三厘，最近從十一月六日起改加百分之九十七的　時增加費每度計一分二厘六一，那麼每度言計銀二分五厘六一，把規元七一五合法幣，每度三分五厘八二。不過此項增加百分之九十七的臨時費，須待十二月份電燈賬上，　陸續開出：眼前十一月份的賬單上，還是百分之六十的臨時增加費，因為十一月份的賬單，十九還是十月份用卻的電度。</p>
<p>至於電力用電；（俗稱馬達電）自然比電燈便宜。原價每度Hwh愛多瓦特為銀四厘五毫，現在再加臨時增加費每度四厘三毫六五，（同電燈一樣百分之九十七。）合計每月使用達三百小時以上，超過額定電度時，其超過額每字，還能減卻銀五毫（照原價）計算。</p>
<p>再有電熱用電，包含電灶電熨鬥電爐等　原價比電力再便宜五毫，每度為銀四厘整。現在他加百分之九七，每度三毫八八，合計每度為銀七毫八八，合法幣分一厘〇二。</p>
<p>末了我順便報告一下水費的計算法；法商水電公司的量水，也和公共租界自來水公司不同；前者是用立方公尺計算，後者是用加侖計算。事實上每一立方公尺水量，約等於二百二十加侖。原價為銀八分七厘五毫；從十一月六日起也更改臨時增加費為百分之三十，計銀二分六厘二毫五，合計一錢一爭三厘七毫五，也把規元七一五合法幣，那麼每一立方公尺是一角五分九厘一毫，但用不足額定立方公尺時，另外再開補是之數。</p>

<p>— 聖凱</p>
<p>十一月十六日　（續）</p>
<p>按日銀的發行制度業已三次在同一方式下加以改革，一九三二年高橋氏出任財長之時，即將日本銀行紙幣保證限度由歷來的一萬二千萬日元，一躍而為十萬萬日元，是為第一次的改革。中日戰事發生之後，通貨膨脹有急激的進展，由一九三七年六月底的十六萬四千萬日元擴張到二十三萬零五百萬元，膨脹程度勢難制止，乃不得不追認事實，再由十萬萬日元擴張為十七萬日元，但因黃金準備評價之後，已將黃金準備由四萬八千八百萬日元抬高為八萬萬日元，故保證準備實質上所擴張的不下十萬萬日元之多，是為第二次的改革。然一九三九年以來，日銀發行有增無減，是年底見三十六萬七千九百萬日元之最高紀錄，故於四月中保證準備更由十七萬萬日元擴張五萬萬日元而為二十二萬萬日元，是為第三次的改革。無如黃金準備已由八萬萬日元減為五萬萬日元，一九三九年底限外發行額仍達九萬萬七千萬日元，雖屢次擴張保證準備額。今年十月底，則限外發行額已達十萬零五千二百萬日元，無怪日銀總裁要想改革現行的發行制度哩！</p>
<p>不過所謂最高發行制度以及其他的可能的通貨管理，依照英國在此次戰時的措施，不外全額保證準備制度，一九三九年九月三日英國對德宣戰之後，即於六日將英倫銀行的黃金准備依一百六十八先令的評價率，以二萬萬七千八百萬鎊的黃金轉入匯兌　凖賬，發行部所剩餘的金凖備，僅十萬零二千鎊，同時保證發行限度由三萬萬鎊提高至五萬萬八千萬鎊。故日銀所計謀的發行制度的根本改革，無非將這名目上的五萬萬日元黃金準備全數轉入匯兌資金，而將二十二萬萬的保證準備額再行提高，變成全額保證制度，或設一限額的最高的保證制度。</p>
<p>日銀的發行制度將來是否如此，尚待事實證明。不過觀其歷來的改革無不是在追認膨脹事實，則將來的改革當然亦不外是追　膨脹事實。可是過去的追認膨脹事實，即啟未來的膨脹事實，則將來的追認膨脹事實，則將來的改革當然亦不外是追　膨脹事實。可是過去的追認膨脹事實，即啟未來的膨脹事實，則將來的追認膨脹事實，無疑的是啟更將來的膨脹事實，行見第一次歐戰時德國的馬克的遭遇，恐將發見於東方的　心國。</p>
<p>日本貿易的前途</p>
<p>日本的貿易情況，自中日戰事發生之後，即長期的惡化，雖經設法改善，總因侵略的野心不死，致國際政治與商務形勢的演變而蒙不利。自德義日三國軍事經濟同盟成立後，貿易形勢，愈為困厄。為恐貿易情形足以暴露國家缺點，決定停止發表貿易統計。可是最近數月來輸出品存底大增，致國內資金週轉困難後，藏相不得不宣稱決計改變對外貿易政策，專注其力以增進日元集團與德義軸心的貿易，而不復注意於美元和英鎊集團的貿易。日本對外貿易的悲慘，是注定的難以改善了。</p>
<p>本來日本的貿易生命線，對英鎊集團是出超，對美元集團是入超，於是以由英鎊集團所得的外匯頭　向美元集團以購進物資。可是它對日元集團以購進物資。可是它對日元集團貿易大出超，此次歐戰又使日本的出口貿易大減，向美元集團購　資源的資金不易籌，以致不易便利地獲得物資。而因對美關係惡化，獲取主要資源的問題愈增困難。</p>
<p>自與德義訂盟之後，顯然的與英美站在敵對的地位，英美為報復起見，貿易情況自然更為不利。美國不但重申禁令，十月三日更進一步限制出口，凡軍用探海燈空中攝影機及其他軍事設備上用品，均須受出口登記手續的統制。同時菲律濱又考慮對日實施禁運，以便建立與美國相似的統制出口辦法，以加緊美國對日的禁運。至於英國方面，最先印度對調品運日加以限制，十一月七日起加爾加答海關又停止簽發生蔴及熟蔴對日出口憑證，按蔴在軍用品中用處甚大，則此舉不啻等於對日禁運軍需品原料。本來依存英美的貿易生命線既經到了絕續存亡之秋，當然不得不改變一下對外的貿易政策。</p>
<p>但是德義兩國，根本即是一個資源貧乏的國家，何況正要志英苦戰之時，果有何助於日本的貿易？要想以德義的產物來替代英美的地位，根本不是生意經。至於日元集團，日本所輸出的僅能來　持元系通貨的價值，那裏有什麼物資可搜刮而去，更無足以換購物資的外匯資金。最近它所控制的越南，似乎是日本的貿易的生命線了，可是與英美較　起來，它對於日本所渴望的其比重又顯見得輕微不夠。至於荷印，除施行武力佔領外，無法壓倒英美，獨占資源。</p>
<p>總之日本的貿易情形，過去是惡化，現在是困難，將來是悲慘。藏相的改變於專力增進日元集團與德義軸心的貿易，決不是日本貿易的前進，日本的貿易前途，是在澈底地放棄侵略野心。（完）</p>

<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌</p>
<p>要研究關於夫婦生活的一切問題，那真是很複雜的。大凡一對夫婦之結合，總不能逃下列三種原因：（一）由於羨慕對方的金錢而結合，（二）純粹由於愛情而結合，（三）奉父母之命，媒妁之言而結合，此三點均係男女結成夫婦之主要理由。如若　以透徵之觀察，則金錢之結合總不能敵愛的結合來得幸福濃厚，一個年老力衰的人，雖然可以拿金錢去籠絡一個少女，但其所得者並非真正的愛情，而是敷衍，冷淡，甚至同床異夢，夫婦之名，大有朝不保夕之概。</p>
<p>反是，一對貧窮的夫婦，若確由於雙方愛情相投而締成良緣，則雖無米為炊，而甘效牛衣之對泣，其愛情歷苦而彌堅，罕有下堂求去者。這是什麼緣故呢？蓋男女之結成夫婦，率直言之，是性愛之結合，但此性愛又非金錢所可購得的，蓋此性愛乃由健康而來，身體健康者，能營健全的兩性生活，結果，產生了無可比喻的歡暢與甜密。從這歡暢甜蜜中，而收獲了如膠如漆的愛情，所以我的結論是：夫婦失歡完全由於性欲之衰退而來，這一點希請賢明的夫婦們，加以注意。</p>
<p>性欲衰退之後，必有早洩，陰萎等毛病。照生理方面論斷，春事喜劇開始之後，其濃情沸點的時候，女子較男子為落後，若不幸的女子，又嫁給一個早洩，陰萎的丈夫，那這樣的婚姻，極顯明的，祇有悲慘的可期！</p>
<p>為了要拯救這種不幸的男子，我們做醫生的真煞費苦心，對性機能衰弱一症的治療，業已發現最新療法，患者如能積極服以睾丸內分泌制劑「補體康」，即可澈底根治。</p>

<p>當淋病患者感到痛苦凶猛，不能忍受之時，其恐怖情形，實難以言語形容之。因此患者受病魔之威脅；濫服市上劣藥，或受市上手術落伍，設備未週之醫生治療，結果，淋病大多在等錯誤之治療下，失去寶貴之易愈機會。此為一般淋病患者，在治療上至可扼腕之事。因近傾一般市上之成藥，其目的僅可求一時之效，而其成分精粗濫，混用檀油等敗胃與作品腎等之　大副作用，結果，小便雖得暫時暢利，但不久，病勢更來得凶惡，因為此種成藥，既有敗胃等惡劣的副作用，對於病家之抵抗力，反而大加減損；故在病況上亦大為不利。此為濫服霸烈劣藥之惡果。更有一種局部治標之成藥，如透膜殺菌療法，僅能遷延時日，而決難望其達到根治之目的。</p>

<p>（治驗理由）患者汪君永叔之病，初起本為前尿道炎，醫治得法，原可二星期中完全治愈。然因在急生淋時，汪君未能即刻加有效之處治，致淋菌蔓延深部，又受　飲之重大刺　結果抬為淋菌領路，侵攝護腺部，而使腺體腫大，成為嚴重之攝護腺炎。因此等淋毒性之攝護腺炎腫，治療不得其法，即有潰瘍化膿之危險，攝護如成化膿潰瘍，至少在生殖力上受到重大影響，因為攝護腺負分泌攝護腺液之重大使命，此液又為精子養命之源，幸汪君來余處治得早，得能將未化膿之攝護腺炎腫，完全消退，恢復常態。盡余所用之電氣攝護腺按摩，及靜電療法，能直接對淋菌之凶燄加以摧毀，並因有「克淋儂」為內服藥，服之使內部發生抗淋噬菌作用，肅清深部淋菌，濾清污濁之血液，依此周全之治療，故汪君之病，能在二三星期中根治，並恢復生殖力，惟若再拖延若幹時日，則攝護腺化膿，無法挽救矣　兼治梅毒橫痃下疳性神經病弱　每天送診廿號僅取號金五角</p>

<p>— 盛在強醫師</p>
<p>故吾人對於傷風之病狀，殊不可大意疏忽。必須速為治療，以免星星之火，成為燎原之勢。余於肺病之臨床上，業已三十餘年，許多癆病之被人覺察者，大多發覺於流行性感冒之後。不論肺病之初期，及已陷入第二三期，咯血咳嗽，呼吸窒悶等症以進服德國徒梅博士所發明之「補肺拿爾」一藥之功效為最佳。因「補肺拿爾」一藥，係配合礦植物等富於殺滅結核之貴重成分，更輔以補血促增食欲之劑混合而成。服之有搜補癆菌，增進食欲，強大抵抗力，而重築肺病之堤防，且進而緊束病灶，使癆菌毫無活動之餘地，結果全部癆菌，均歸掃除，而頑固肺病完全治愈。惟在流行性感冒時服之，尤能解熱祛痰防癆。</p>

<p>— 編者</p>
<p>西方人有一句成語，叫做「安全第一」，Satty　first意思就是說我們無論做甚麽事情，總以安全為第一要着，輕舉妄動與橫衝直撞，是萬萬耍不得的。</p>
<p>在衣食住行四大項中，無論對於那一項，都可以「安全第一」作做右銘，尤以「行」一項爲最須注意在車輛輻輳的上海馬路上，允其時時刻刻要把「安全第一」四字掛在心頭。</p>
<p>租界當局因鑒於車輛肇禍案之激增，曾到處貼有「馬路如虎口，當中不可走」的標語，以警吿一般市民；去年又曾提倡安全運動一週，作實際的工作，果然成效卓著，一年來肇禍案減少了不少。所以今秋自十八日起，決定再來一下，凡是做市民的都該從旁贊助，書力宣傳，對於婦孺們更要切切實實地說明，使伊們明白這安全運動的重大意義，使滾滾車輪之下，從，願大家在一步一趨之間，千萬不要忘了這四字眞言「安全第一！」</p>

<p>— 姚家現小學演講稿</p>
<p>街道：街道（馬路）之建設，係備各項車輛使用，惟行人（走路人）於必要時，可自路之一面穿至對面。</p>
<p>街沿：街沿（水門訂）係專為行人而設，故較高於街道，籍以保障街沿上之行。</p>
<p>車輛：各項車輛，須行駛於街道之左半邊，行駛較速之車輛，（如機汽車等）近該一半街道之中央，而緩行之各車，（如人力車等）須靠近街沿。</p>
<p>階沿上之行人：行人應在階沿上行走，最宜在右面之階沿上行走，若是則汝可明瞭對方駛來之車輛。</p>
<p>須牢記。（一）切勿為省時間，而在階沿上奔跑或賽跑，或追趕遊伴。時間賓貴，性命比時間更賣貴！（二）切勿由弄堂內，不顧一切，疾奔至階沿或對面弄內。（三）切勿在階沿上玩物，或各種喜劇，以及騎腳踏車，或溜冰。（四）勿在階沿上低頭深思，或閱看圓書，書籍，報紙。</p>
<p>行人在街道上應特別注意者：（一）於必要穿過街道時，須先看淸右邊，後看左邊。（二）見街道上漆有黃綫及階沿上如有「由此通過」之標牌者，務須每次採用之。淮赤須先看右邊，如無車輛駛來，在黃線內行至中間，見如有站台者略停，在看左邊，然後在黃綫內走至對面階沿。（三）須留意並服從崗警舉手指揮，或交通指揮燈信號，如見紅燈，卽須停止；見綠燈方可前進。惟如見黃燈與紅或綠燈同時放映，則如尙未走至路之交义點，或尙未走過路上之白綫，亦須停正進行。</p>
<p>汝不應違背者：（一）如左右尙未看淸，切勿離開階沿而走至街道上。（二）切勿站立街道，或在街道徘徊停留，以及在車輛中間　走。（三）切勿在街道追趕玩物或遊伴，或自學校店舖，或家中奔馳至街道中。（四）切勿在街道上溜冰，或具他類似之遊戲。（五）切勿攀附於任何車輛上。（六）切勿在停止車輛之前或後，未看淸楚，而穿過街道。（七）切勿貿然上下公共汽車，雷車，或人力車等，而不加注意。</p>
<p>街道上之騎腳踏車者：兒童駛用腳踏車來玩學校，或運動以及遊戲者，頗不乏人，故附左列警吿，藉以指示：（一）切莫不用舉手信號，忽然轉灣，或在路角向右疾駛，並小轉灣，因若是極易發生意外。（二）勿驟然超越前車，恐失平衡而致傾跌也。（三）勿與別車並列而行，三四部並行者，危險非凡。（四）須避免電車軌道，及油滑地點，以免滑跌。（五）勿自左邊越渦前車，因如前面車輛靠邊停止，易於肇禍也。（六）切勿攀附電車，汽車，或人力車等，因於放手時，極易傾跌也。（七）切勿試行巧妙騎術，如雙手脫空，雙足置於一面等，以免失足。（八）須時刻留意並服從崗警舉手指揮，或交通指揮燈信號，如見紅燈，卽須停止；見綠燈方可前事。如見黃燈與紅或綠燈同時放映，則如尙未駛至路之交义點，或尙未駛過路上之白錢，亦須停止進行。　兒童因違章而發生意外，時有所聞，皆因缺乏交通常識之故。須時刻記憶上述一切，則可避免危險，而得安全，且於無形中協助他人。</p>
<p>請指導較汝年幼之小朋友及同學，如在同行時，論以遵守章則，曉以切身利害，於必要時，協助彼等，共策安全，是為至要。</p>

<p>來客說：『我們又來打擾了。』</p>
<p>『這算什麼話，工作了一星期，今天就該開開心才對哩。』這是眞話，中人對於麻將是頗感興趣的；其實客人也是一樣，吾則，眞的怕打擾人家，決不會的好了『搭子』一同來的。</p>
<p>女主人很是殷勤，倒茶送烟，說說笑笑，對道幾位客人是熟透了的。她俏皮地說：『打麻將是不是？那末事情要快，在房裏踱來踱去，看你們好像是很不安定的。』女主人自己雖然沒有打的分兒，但是在她先生的背後張法張法，或者『打邊上第×張』『吃，吃；吃他一張！』也自有她的趣味，但是最大的理由是：打完了牌，輸的是她先生的錢，設若贏呢，她的『乾股』的分紅是很大的。</p>
<p>有個客人倒不掩飾，接着女主人的口氣說：『是呀，要义麻將末大家快。』</p>
<p>但是，在僅有一張的檯子上，有三個孩子在做功課呢！三個小的大的還只三四年級，在演算着除法；一個大的，占了半張的檯子，什麼墨水，圖解紙，尺以及那種繪畫的儀器，無决序的散開着。那些孩子用心地，雖然當客人進來的時候曾看了一眼，但是繼續的又把全付精神灌入到工作裹去了。為了要打麻將，把那般努力工作的孩子打發開去，客人們當然是小好意思這樣做的，於是其中有已個智巧地對主人說了：『莫先生，是你下塲，還是你的夫人下塲呀？』</p>
<p>這樣，主人就說了：『我來，我來。』一邊命令他的夫人找牌，又對二個孩子說：『你們晚上再寫能。』</p>
<p>年小的孩子本來不懂得什麽，他們的所以讀書寫字，最大的原因是怕聽爸爸黑起了臉，大聲的敎訓，現在爸爸自己請他們不要寫，自然是「得令」，像遇了赦令似的，打攏書包，在抽屜裹翻出二隻陀螺，一溜烟的就往外向跑。</p>
<p>三個客人，媽媽爸爸，都立在那個年紀較大的孩子的周圍；二個弟弟已跑出去了，他當然不好意冉做他的功課了，慢慢地，也收拾攏他的文具。</p>
<p>『呵，眞用功，星期日應該出去玩玩才好呢！』客人自言自語的安慰着說：『眞像一個小姐，總是不出門的。』</p>
<p>『將來一定考中女狀元。』還有個客人湊趣。</p>
<p>大的孩子終於悶着聲，低着頭的走了。卽刻，「嘩啦啦」一聲，麻將牌跳躍在檯子上了</p>

<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第十一章　趙伯雄的供詞</p>
<p>他的歉意當然是指電話間中的那粒槍彈。他的說話的神氣，倒也相當誠懇。霍桑似也領會到他的誠意，便點了點頭。</p>
<p>他說道：「你想用這樣的方式警吿我，叫我不要干涉這一件事，那不能不說你的估量錯誤；同時也顯見你太漠視了我的歷史。不過我也承認，當時你的確祇想警吿，還沒有惡意。」</p>
<p>那假老頭子忽然從沙發上直跳起來，大聲說：「霍先生，你寬恕我了嗎？你的腦力眼力，眞不能不使人佩服。眞的，我完全沒有惡意。我間槍的時候，瞄過了你的高度，你竟也領會到。霍先生——」</p>
<p>霍桑緩緩地接口說：「是的，我瞧過那木壁上的彈孔，超出我的高度半吋。不過你那時如果想打中我，你的舉動的敏捷性似乎還差些兒。」</p>
<p>我聽這兩個人針鋒相對地談話，精神上引起了一種不可言喩的興奮。這趙伯雄確是個厲害的人物。可是孫悟空的一個觔斗，終於逃不出釋迦牟尼的手掌！</p>
<p>霍桑又繼續說道：「趙先生，請坐下來。你再把剛才大同路上李芝範的事說一說。」</p>
<p>趙伯雄收攝了驚異的情緒坐下來，定一定神，方才答話。「這件事和我沒有關係。事實也很簡單。因為我經過了一度推想，覺得殺死王麗蘭的，也許就是李芝範。因為當我要追踪那穿雨衣的人離開二十七號時，伊的會客室中祇有麗蘭和那老頭兒兩個人。等我失望了冉回到伊門外去時，屋內屋外並無異狀，時間的相隔，前後最多不過十分鐘，麗蘭却就在這時間中死去。所以除了這李芝範外，的確沒有第二僩可疑的人。今天午後，我在警廳裹得到了剖騐的消息，知道麗蘭是因刀致命，我的槍彈碰巧也打在同一的傷口裹。我的理想旣然證實，便想去瞧瞧李芝範，問問他為什麼要殺死麗蘭。（一六九）鏞</p>
<h3 id="c104">汽車肇禍的七個原因 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— 鏞</p>
<p>世界每一個大都會內，每天總有各種汽車肇禍事情的發生，上海的情形當然亦如此。美國哈佛大學街道交通委員會為硏究此一問題，曾特的專家數人，耗費數年的光陰；他們的結論說是大半由於駕駛者犯了七僩原因；現譯述於下，以供各界作為參考，而收盡量避免之效。</p>
<p>（一）不能適度用制動機，尤以過慢爲肇禍的原因。</p>
<p>（二）駕駛技術不成熟。</p>
<p>（三）不能估計同方向進行的他種車輛的速度。</p>
<p>（四）駕駛者有目疾。</p>
<p>（五）缺乏判斷力。</p>
<p>（六）遇危急時手足無措，沒有鎭靜的態度。</p>
<p>（七）視綫受向面車輛的車頭燈光的閃鑠而失正常。</p>
<p>「生活程度」解釋　名</p>
<p>我們時常聽到一般人討論到近來的上海情形，總是說：現在上海的「生活程度」實在太高了，其實這句話是錯的，或者他們對於這一個專門名字沒有澈底的了解罷。</p>
<p>那未什麼叫做「生活程度」呢？簡言之，生活的收入與生活的費用成比例：若是物價低，生活的收入高，這纔叫「生活程度」高；而現在我的所處的地位，物價上漲的倍數與生活收入相差天壤，却巧是「生活程度」低，而所高者乃是生活費用，所以我們應叫生活費用高而不能叫「生活程度」高。</p>

<p>Tokyo: According to a semi-official Japanese source yesterday, regarding the concentration of Thai troops on the Vietnamese border, Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux stated that France is determined to maintain the status quo in Vietnam and rejects Thailand's demands. According to indirect Vietnamese sources, Vietnam and Thailand have had several clashes, but these are local incidents. The border area is currently very quiet, but the French military authorities are paying close attention and taking necessary measures to deal with unexpected events.

<p>Vichy: Rumors of tense relations between Thailand and Vietnam and border disputes have not been heard by officials here.

<p>Vichy: News received here today states that after France rejected Thailand's territorial demands, Thai troops invaded Vietnam last night.

Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux notified the Vichy government yesterday that negotiations with the Thai government had broken down and that Thai troops had immediately attacked. It is reported that the fiercest fighting is taking place in the Kapo area. Vietnamese troops are currently resisting at various border strongholds. In his telegram, Governor-General Decoux expressed to the Vichy government his determination to resist Thailand's pressure to revise its borders, which has intensified since Vietnam made concessions to Japan. This new development along the border follows a series of incidents in recent weeks. In the past few days, Thailand has been concentrating its troops on the Mekong River along the Thai-Vietnamese border due to the lack of progress in French-Thai negotiations.

<h3 id="e16">What the Japanese Miyako Shimbun Says <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 16th stated: "The Miyako Shimbun said in today's editorial that although the contents of the measures decided at Wednesday's Imperial Conference have not yet been officially announced, there must have been some progress in the resolution of the China Incident. It would be best for Chongqing to consider peace before Japan officially recognizes the new government in Nanjing." Those with a keen interest in international politics will not easily overlook this dispatch and dismiss it as fleeting smoke. Although the essence of this newspaper's statement may not be as significant as smoke in actual international politics.</p>
<p>We are unwilling to prejudicially regard this newspaper's statement as something to ignore or something to hear and take lightly. However, what this newspaper now expects from the Chinese National Government cannot be immediately regarded as this newspaper being certain of the content of Wednesday's Japanese Imperial Conference before adopting this attitude and stating its wishes; nor can this wishful attitude be immediately regarded as powerful public opinion from powerful Japanese circles; nor can it be regarded as the Japanese authorities using this newspaper to make this statement to the National Government, intending to test the waters. Therefore, this newspaper's statement is not enough to attract much attention from anyone. To give it importance would be to say that it is a test; if it is a test, only the Chinese National Government has the obligation to respond to it in any way. This is not our business.</p>
<p>We feel endlessly grateful for this—or perhaps it can be said to be gratuitous. First, after Japan launched its military invasion of China, it has been seen everywhere as reckless and disregarding everything. However, Japan has not rashly recognized the Nanjing situation after the end of March of this year. We once praised this restraint as being both crude and meticulous, and still being solemn. We still remember that in late April, Tokyo sent Abe to Nanjing. From our observations, we once advised Abe, saying in brief that an invalid signed agreement would not allow Japan to gain more or China to lose more, but would make it more difficult for Japan to correct its mistakes in the future, increasing an unnecessary concern for face and reducing the courage and opportunity to correct mistakes as soon as possible." Time has passed quickly for another six or seven months to the present. Abe is said to have quietly returned after reaching an agreement. According to what the Miyako Shimbun said the day before yesterday, it seems that the Japanese side can still remain restrained and stand at the crossroads of late April. That is, they have not yet rashly decided to take the road of no return. Second, who says who likes to wage war and kill and dislikes peace? If you say it yourself, it is deceiving yourself; if you blame others, it is slandering others; especially after a long war and a great slaughter! However, peace is ultimately not the primary meaning of international life. If good and bad fortune are judged by whether there is peace or not, then who advocates not having peace? If life and death are judged by whether there is war or not, then who willingly chooses not to fight? Japan has been at war with China to this stage. Whether it is a subjective preference or an objective condition, it sincerely seeks peace. This is what we believe thousands of times. However, how can the Japanese side's peace proposals under the theory of good and bad fortune convince China's determination to resist the war under the theory of life and death? Now the Japanese side throws the issue of the life and death of the Chinese nation into the misty smoke and seeks peace from China, asking China to consider peace. This is either a selfish and foolish act or it is so foolish that it loses its sincerity in seeking peace without knowing it. Third, China is confident that it will become stronger as it fights, is confident that it will win, and must win. However, before the strength for China's general counteroffensive is fully developed, or even before the opportunity to launch a general counteroffensive is obtained, we must calmly admit that the key to peace and war between China and Japan is in the hands of Japan and depends on Japan. In other words, as long as Japan automatically corrects its policy of aggression and withdraws its invading troops and other invading organizations, the war will naturally disappear immediately and peace will naturally be realized immediately. Then, is the so-called hope that Chongqing will consider peace not a reversal of cause and effect and a fundamental misconception? Fourth, the so-called "It would be best before Japan officially recognizes the new government in Nanjing," etc. Regarding this hint of opportunity, we are willing to make benevolent plans for Japan and point out that the Japanese side should pay close attention to it, just as we discussed in late April. However, only the Japanese side's misconceptions would mistakenly believe that this is an important opportunity with any significant relationship. This is because recognition or non-recognition, official or unofficial recognition, and even the signing of contracts, absolutely cannot increase or decrease the seriousness of the war that actually exists between China and Japan, expand or contract the size of the situation, or benefit or harm the opportunity to resolve it. The second is because relatively speaking, Tokyo's support for Nanjing is something everyone knows. However, Tokyo believes that giving recognition is powerful support, but it does not know that the whole issue is not at all here. It must be known that the less Tokyo takes, the more Nanjing gets. Then there is the real benefit of supporting them. If Japan takes nothing in China, Nanjing can then have something to do in China. The third is absolute. The anti-Japanese war led by the Chinese National Government and the peace advocated by the Nanjing side can be explained with all the words and phrases in the Chinese and foreign dictionaries to show the absolute difference between them. However, using the question "Can China and Japan stop the war and achieve peace?" as a yardstick, the answer is absolutely the same under strict conditions and strict premises of absolutely no deception and absolutely no distortion. Why do we say this? The reason why the National Government leads the anti-Japanese war and the reason why the Chinese people support the National Government's leadership in the anti-Japanese war is to preserve the integrity of sovereignty and territory and to strive for the independence and freedom of the nation. If this is achieved, peace will be restored; if it is not achieved, the anti-Japanese war will continue. This is absolute. As for the Nanjing side, if it can truly and reliably achieve the integrity of sovereignty and territory and the independence and freedom of the nation through the so-called path to peace, then the war between China and Japan will naturally no longer exist, and Nanjing will be completely successful. China and Japan will be completely resolved. If these absolute conditions cannot be reliably achieved in fact, then there is no way to stop the war in fact, that is, there is no way to achieve peace in fact. The reasoning is too accurate and simple. Official recognition or non-recognition is just a matter between Tokyo and Nanjing. What opportunity does it create for the overall situation of China and Japan? What important opportunity does it create? What the "Miyako Shimbun" said, assuming it is a test, can be imagined that the National Government will never regard this as a problem. Even if we discuss Tokyo and Nanjing, is that what is really being contested?</p>

<p>Chongqing: This morning's editorial in the Central Daily News stated that the appointment of the commander-in-chief of the British Qianzhi Tank Corps, the Soviet Union's non-recognition of the treaty signed with Japan, and the speech by US Secretary of the Navy Knox, promising to give China greater assistance, all guarantee China's victory. This kind of international development shows that Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union all have the determination to resist Japan's continued aggression in the Pacific. The article concludes: "A new dawn has broken for an independent new China. We must seize this great opportunity and make the greatest effort to achieve final victory." (17th dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>Washington: Yesterday's commentary in the Navy and Army News stated that Japan's future southward advance in the Pacific depends on whether the United States will send submarines and aircraft to the Philippines to increase the naval and air strength of the area. The newspaper also stated that whether Britain can take steps in a nimble manner, with the help of US airfields, to reinforce the defense of Singapore is also a major factor. The newspaper also said, "Washington has made it clear that if the American flag flies over the Philippines, the United States will consider protecting the Philippines to be the first step related to its own security. This fact currently has an impact on the Far East situation." (17th dispatch from United Press)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The newspapers here are paying close attention to the news that Japan will open new air routes in the South Seas. The newspapers believe that Pan American Airlines has already expanded its Pacific flights from Manila via Hong Kong to Singapore, so the expansion of Japanese air routes is very important. Japan Airlines has announced that its new route, which will be established soon, will fly from Palau in the Mariana Islands to Tamsui in Taiwan. The test flight of this 2,800-kilometer long route will take place on November 28. The company continued that after the establishment of this new air route, this 12,300-kilometer air network in the Western Pacific will connect Japan with the South Seas. This air network runs from Yokohama in the north to Jaluit in the Marshall Islands, east to Tamsui, and west to Palau. Asahi Shimbun said that this new air route will make the connection between the South Seas and Japan even closer and will greatly help develop Japan's "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."

<p>Washington: Concerns that Japan will launch an attack on the Dutch East Indies have now been slightly reduced due to the oil agreement recently reached between Japan and the Dutch East Indies. It is believed that this oil agreement has been tacitly approved by the Dutch, British, and American governments, hoping to slightly postpone the date of reckoning with Japan, which is determined to seize the entire Far East. The Dutch East Indies now has a firm determination to defend its sovereignty and is continuously strengthening its defense forces. Its actions, such as purchasing aircraft from the United States, are all manifestations of this. Therefore, people here are quite satisfied. (17th dispatch from Reuters)</p>

<p>London: According to news received in London, the training period for pilots, observers, and gunners in Canada, in accordance with the British training plan, will be shortened in order to give these personnel combat training in wartime conditions. Canada has sufficient facilities for training the air force and can train a larger number of people than originally planned. Therefore, the number of trainees has increased. Soon, 30,000 pilots will join the service. The first batch of Australian pilots to be trained in Canada has now received high-level training. In the coming months, a large number of aviation students from Australia and New Zealand will also be sent to Canada, which is more than expected. Canadian Air Force Minister Power recently stated that air defenses on both coasts of Canada are currently being strengthened. The US-Canada Joint Defense Committee has studied the air defenses of the Pacific coast, but he could not announce the measures decided upon. (17th dispatch from Reuters)</p>

<p>Aden: A Reuters correspondent claims that the Arab tribes in the remote parts of the Aden Protectorate are now paying close attention to Britain's war effort. I just returned from a three-day visit to the protectorates on the northwest border. Along the way, large numbers of people asked me and the accompanying military officers for news in detail. After telling them about the recent British victories, they all expressed their satisfaction. According to the report, the desolate mountainous area between this protectorate and Yemen was still a place where bandits roamed three years ago, and passing travelers were often robbed at gunpoint. Now, it has been completely changed. The government guarantees the safety of the roads, and those who travel there can sleep soundly without fear. I met a tribal chief who used to make a living by robbery and learned that he has now reformed and donated 17 pounds two weeks ago for the government to purchase fighter planes. At present, the young people in the area are flocking here to join the native army. The Arabs' hatred of Italy is quite strong. A powerful tribal chief asked me to tell the British people that the Arabs are willing to be their support and hope that God will grant them a swift victory. (17th dispatch from Reuters)</p>

<p>London: This morning, London newspapers are prominently featuring speculation about the true significance of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's recent visit to Berlin. Concurrently, rumors concerning future peace proposals have arrived from the Portuguese capital. According to these Lisbon rumors, British Ambassador to Spain, Sir Samuel Hoare, met with Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar, with the discussion potentially involving preliminary talks on future peace negotiations. It is also rumored that British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Lothian, currently in Lisbon, also conferred with Sir Samuel Hoare. Official sources have declined to comment on these rumors. However, semi-official sources claim that Britain has no intention of making any peace proposals. The Daily Express carries a report from Istanbul stating that Hitler requested Soviet aid, and Molotov's visit to Berlin was Hitler's last-ditch effort to involve the Soviet Union in the war. The newspaper states that if the Soviet Union rejects Hitler's strategy, German Ambassador to Turkey, Franz von Papen, will be dispatched to Ankara to request Turkey to act as a mediator between Britain and Germany.

<p>Fuzhou: Commodity prices in various places have soared in the past two months, especially for daily necessities. Chairman Chen Yi issued an order last month to strictly suppress prices. If any unscrupulous merchants are found manipulating the market, they will be severely punished. Detailed measures for price suppression have been established, ordering all county and municipal governments to establish price stabilization committees to thoroughly suppress prices. Subsequently, personnel were dispatched to various counties to inspect and guide, while also facilitating transportation, adjusting supply and demand, and promoting thrift. Currently, the prices of essential goods in various counties, such as fish, meat, vegetables, cotton yarn, cloth, and fuel, have uniformly decreased, falling by one-third to one-tenth compared to last month. Merchants are generally able to comply with the government's fixed prices and sell goods. The situation in Yong'an, Nanping, Jian'ou, and Putian is particularly good. Fuzhou and southern Fujian are also working hard to suppress prices, and commodity prices are gradually falling. Many people who originally felt financially strained are now gradually relieved and happy. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Changsha: The price suppression movement in Hunan Province was implemented on the 17th. Reports received from various places in the past three days indicate that the market is extremely stable, and the people are rejoicing. Most merchants are also able to share the difficulties of the times, abide by government orders, and sell their stored rice, coal, oil, and other commodities at approved prices. However, in a few markets, prices are slightly fluctuating due to insufficient supply. The government has taken measures to stabilize them. In Changsha, several shops selling rice, coal, and oil have been forced to close due to a shortage of goods and difficulty in replenishing supplies. The government and the Chamber of Commerce have established rice, coal, and oil markets to supply the people. However, because the goods are still en route and have not arrived, the amount and number of purchases have been temporarily restricted. The people understand and fully support this temporary measure taken by the government. Therefore, the temporary market fluctuations have quickly returned to stability. People in Hunan are confident that this determination to suppress prices using political power, if successful, will open a new era for the entire country. (17th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Athens: War reports from the front reveal that, after the Greek army completed its encirclement of this key border town in the Greco-Italian war, after the most intense bloodshed, they occupied Korçë today. Korçë is the key to the major road from the Albanian Adriatic coast to central and northern Greece. Italian forces have used it as an important base for invading Greece. The news of the city's encirclement was released by the Greek High Command here. The communique stated that the Greek army, in one of the fiercest battles of the war, captured Mount Ivan, which is 45,000 feet high, thus completing its encirclement of Korçë. The Greek people were overjoyed by this news. Soon after, news from the front announced that Korçë had been occupied by the victorious Greek army advancing forward. The joy of the Greek people after hearing this news reached a climax. It is rumored that when the Italian army prepared to abandon Korçë, it set fire to several places in the city. Yesterday, the Greek army launched a bayonet charge against the Italian defenses on top of Mount Ivan, which led to fierce hand-to-hand combat with the Italian army. It is said that the terrible bloodshed on both sides is indicative of the intensity of the battle. The Greek army attacked uphill and occupied the entire mountain overlooking Korçë. It is believed here that the occupation of Korçë, an Italian base, is an important victory for the Greek army and a major loss for the Italian army. As a result of this development, the Italian position has been further weakened. (International News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>Athens: Last night, the Greek official communique continued to release news of Greek victories, stating that there were important battles on the entire front on Saturday, especially in Epirus. Greek forces captured many enemy soldiers and seized many mortars and other war equipment. When the enemy army withdrew from Anghe, it burned down more than half of the town. On Saturday, Italian planes bombed several towns with no military significance, but there were no casualties anywhere. (Reuters, 17th)</p>

One of our aircraft did not return to its original base. The facilities in Souda Bay on Crete were also bombed by our aircraft. (Haitong, 17th)</p>
<p>Salonika: Well-informed sources say that the Italian army is unlikely to launch a counter-offensive this week. If the Italian army wishes to counter-attack, it must replenish the heavy artillery it abandoned during the retreat. Reports from the front state that the Greek army is now intensifying its encirclement of the Italian army. Many Italian soldiers have been captured. In the past forty-eight hours, hundreds of captured Italian soldiers have passed through Salonika. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>Greek Forces Advance into Albanian Territory, Occupying Italian Permanent Fortresses</p>
<p>Athens: War reports from the front today stated that Korçë, a major Italian base in Albania, is now on fire after being surrounded by Greek forces. Greek forces are approaching and launching fierce attacks. Several divisions of the defeated Italian army are retreating rapidly along the only passable highway. Greek sources predict that Korçë will be captured within forty-eight hours. The Greek High Command stated that the Greek army made glorious achievements through the fiercest bloodshed with bayonet charges, eventually clearing the last high ground of Italian defenses. At the same time, more than 150,000 Greek soldiers, along a hundred-mile front from the Adriatic Sea to the southern border, bravely charged forward, pushing back the attacking Italian forces in various areas. Last night, the Greek vanguard began to descend from the high ground towards Korçë, seeing the Italian defenses retreating entirely from the western entrance of Korçë, and seeing large fires in many places, indicating that the Italian army was burning a large number of military supplies that it could not take away. At the same time, other Greek forces recaptured Nycombe, a Greek railway district. After the Italian army set fire to it, they retreated into Albanian territory. In the central area north of the Pindus Mountains, the Greek army took advantage of the victory to advance, crossing the border and occupying the entire first line of Italian permanent fortresses in Albanian territory. This line is known as the Second Maginot Line of southern Albania. The Italian retreat from Epirus was rapid. The Greek High Command stated that as the Greek army advanced in the Epirus area, they captured hundreds of trench mortars and tanks, as well as countless other military supplies.

<p>Ohrid: West of Mount Smolicas, Greek forces attacked the Italian army on the Mesaara road yesterday, forcing it to retreat into Albanian territory. The Greek army took advantage of the victory and pursued, occupying several mountain peaks in Albanian territory west of Leskovik. Another report said that British and three Greek planes bombed the port of Vlora in Albania, killing fourteen people and wounding forty. Italian planes bombed Ioannina yesterday morning, killing two people and wounding three, destroying one house. The inhabitants of Korçë have all fled because the city is under constant bombardment by Greek artillery. It is reported that General Soddu, commander of the Italian army and commander-in-chief of the invasion of Greece, is now retreating the Italian army in Korçë along the highway south to Leskovik, and concentrating it in two small villages ten kilometers south of Korçë. This move may be a prelude to an attack on Kastoria. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>British Planes Bomb Italian Bases; Korçë in Flames</p>
<p>Cairo: The British military authorities here announced this morning in a communique that the British Air Force had mercilessly bombed the Italian forces attacking in Greece and Egypt. At the same time, officials confirmed that Korçë, a former Italian base, was in flames after being heavily bombed by the British Air Force. However, details were not known. It is reported that the Italian army suffered extremely heavy casualties in this battle. The communique continued that the British Air Force also bombed Italian bases in Rumeinisa, Sidi Barrani, Bardia, and Ghazala on the Mediterranean coast, destroying countless military targets. It was also announced that the British Army was continuing to repel the Italian forces in the Galabat area. (International News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>Athens: The Albanian town of Korçë, a strategically important point where the Italian army is concentrated, is likely to fall in the near future, as the Greek army is still attacking the Italian army fiercely today. According to several sources, there is no doubt that Korçë will fall. Now the only question is when it will fall, and optimists hope that a large number of Italian troops in the city will also be captured. Last night, cars and trucks were seen continuously traveling along the highway from Korçë to Vlora. It is believed that this is a sign that the Italian side is preparing to retreat backwards. Greek and British planes bombed this convoy fiercely. Another highway leading to Korçë has been blocked. The Greek army also captured a high peak that can bombard Korçë. The Greek army also seized four Italian heavy artillery pieces at a certain high ground. The Greek army is taking advantage of the current exhaustion of the Italian army and is pushing forward as quickly as possible, even sacrificing sleep, in order to not lose the opportunity to severely damage the enemy. The Greek army attacking Korçë yesterday has entered Albanian territory, and the Greek army in Pindus has also entered Albanian territory between Grammos and Tores. (Reuters, 17th)</p>

<p>Tampico, Mexico: Four German ships here dashed out of the port yesterday and sailed into the sea. Rumors immediately spread that they were intercepted by British ships. The port authorities are now investigating the matter. These four ships have been anchored in the Panuco River near Tampico since the German invasion of Poland. This past Friday, they suddenly sailed into the sea. Soon after, crowds on the shore saw searchlights shining in the distance at sea, followed by the Frigia vessel catching fire. It is rumored that there was a British destroyer near the vessel, but this claim could not be confirmed. Port officials said that someone reported to the bureau that several British cruisers were seen overseas yesterday afternoon, but this report also could not be confirmed. Currently, the Orinoco has returned to its original location due to engine damage, and the other two ships followed suit. The German Consul in Tampico stated that the forty crew members of the Frigia were unharmed. The ship burned to the waterline at 9:30 AM, located three miles from the river mouth. No sounds of artillery or explosions were heard. When the four German ships left the port, Mexican gunboats escorted them to the Mexican territorial waters before returning. At that time, the four ships were lightly loaded, and their destination was said to be a certain port in Spain. It is widely rumored here that they were going to sea to supply fuel to German submarines. With the Frigia on fire, many believe that it was scuttled upon sighting a British ship. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>Tampico: Four warships, seemingly British or perhaps Canadian, drove three of the four German ships back to the Panuco River yesterday morning as the German ships were quickly escaping. The captains of two of the four German ships told the port authorities that these four warships chased their ships into Mexican territorial waters, and they were only spared after Mexican gunboats intervened. The captains also stated that they ordered the ships to speed away when they realized escape was impossible. The German ship personnel all said that they could not identify the chasing ships, whether they were British or Canadian. The testimony of these people seems to completely discredit the earlier reliable reports that the German ships were greatly alarmed by the sudden encounter with American destroyers in Mexican territorial waters. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>Mexico City: Four German cargo ships departed from Tampico yesterday, but were blocked by four warships, presumably owned by the British. One German cargo ship was forced to scuttle itself, while the other three fled back to the port. It is rumored that a German pocket battleship was waiting 300 miles offshore to escort these four merchant ships to Spain. The German merchant ships attempted to break through the British blockade in the Atlantic, but to no avail. According to the captain of the Frigia, Herr Schulte, told Mexican officials that after the German cargo ships were given warning signals by a cruiser and three small ships demanding surrender, he ordered the crew to set the ship on fire and escape in lifeboats. The captain accused the British ships of being only ten miles from the eastern Mexican coast when they intercepted the German ships, thus violating the neutral zone set by the Pan-American Conference. (International News Service, 27th)</p>
<p>Mexico City: A German cargo ship caught fire two hours after sailing out of Tampico Port on Friday night. The flames were visible from the coast. It is believed that this ship was the Frigia, weighing 4,137 tons. This ship secretly sailed out on Friday night in the darkness along with three other German ships: the merchant ship Orinoco, 3,660 tons; the cargo ship Dalwa, 533 tons; and the small ship Reichenstein, 531 tons. These four German ships had been sheltering in Tampico Port since the outbreak of the European war. The port authorities recently received notice that the four German ships were heading to a Spanish port. The four German ships prepared their lifeboats when secretly leaving the port so that they could be lowered at any time. According to unconfirmed reports, the Orinoco experienced engine trouble after passing the seawall. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Tampico, Mexico: This morning, the Mexican fleet patrolled the sea, searching for the four warships that intercepted the German cargo ships yesterday. The German Consul-General in Tampico stated that the four ships were definitely British warships. The German pocket battleship Hill Admiral was waiting 300 miles offshore, monitoring the neutral zone in order to escort the German cargo ships to Spain. The Mexican authorities stated that the four ships may belong to a neutral country, and the nervous German sailors mistakenly thought they were enemy ships. However, the captain of the German cargo ship stated that the four strange ships did chase them into Mexican territorial waters. (International News Service, 17th)</p>

<p>London: According to the Air Ministry's bulletin, German planes again attacked Britain last night, with London and the counties of the headquarters as the main targets. The offensive was far less intense than the night before. Some residential buildings were damaged, but the overall damage was not very great. There were slight casualties among the residents. Several incendiary bombs fell on a certain city in the Midlands, but the fires caused were quickly extinguished. One enemy bomber was shot down last night. A total of five enemy planes were destroyed the night before. The bulletin also stated that the Central Air Force had severely bombed Hamburg again last night in adverse weather. Airfields and seaports in the German-occupied area were also bombed by British planes. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>London: As London workers were excavating in the ruins of the fierce bombing on Friday, several squadrons of giant bombers again attacked London last night, dropping many explosive and incendiary bombs on various districts of the British capital. The Axis air raiders arrived earlier than usual. From the Thames estuary to the bomb-scarred British capital, the thunderous anti-aircraft fire was continuous, but the air raiders successively flew across the English Channel, dropping highly destructive bombs on the British capital and the central areas of various counties. This air raid followed the most intense and longest air raid in London this month. Nazi planes took advantage of the full moon and clear, slightly foggy weather, and squadrons of more than eighty planes swept through the British capital. The intensity of the aerial blitz did not diminish until midnight, after which the offensive began to slacken. Until dawn yesterday, only a few German planes made the usual harassing visits. Other areas of Britain were also subjected to German air raids, but London bore the brunt of the attack. Many people were killed in a certain dormitory, and the dormitory immediately collapsed, and they were buried in the rubble. A large apartment was also directly hit by a bomb and completely destroyed. The world's oldest DeLoran Theatre was also damaged. A bomb passed through the roof of the theater and went straight to the back of the auditorium before exploding. The bomb's cap passed through the auditorium floor and destroyed the seats in the basement bar. Before the air raid on London on Saturday, fierce air battles occurred in the skies over the English Channel, Kent, and the Thames estuary. (International News Service, 17th)</p>
<p>London: Hundreds of German planes launched an unprecedentedly horrific air raid on London last night and this morning. Before midnight, the sound of bombs falling continuously for two hours was mixed with huge explosions throughout the city. "Bread baskets" of mixed bombs and incendiary bombs fell from the sky, and there were also many bombs. The number of deaths and injuries was extremely large. It seemed that German Prime Minister Hitler was using this to retaliate for the bombing of Hamburg and Berlin. It is estimated that among the buildings destroyed in the city, there were seven hospitals, three hotels, two nunneries, two cinemas, several apartment buildings, one image warehouse, one school, one Catholic church, two American churches, four workers' houses, and Sir Stammor, the leader of the Liberal Party in Congress, was among those injured.

<p>Capital of Sweden: Reports from London state that the German Air Force's attacks on London have been more intense and longer in the past week, starting earlier and stopping later. One continuous bombing lasted three hours without interruption, so many incendiary bombs and bombs were dropped, and the British losses were huge, and it was difficult to estimate for a time. At any time last night, there were about two hundred German planes over London. London newspapers have said that the loss is no less than that of Coventry, and its severity can be imagined. (Haitong Telegraph, 17th)</p>
<p>London: Several German bombers again launched a short, fierce night raid on London last night, inflicting new damage on the areas damaged on Friday night. The alarm was lifted at 1:00 AM today, but Londoners hid in air raid shelters until dawn. Only a few German planes broke through the inner defenses of London. Several German planes were shot down by the British, but the exact number was not announced in this morning's Air Ministry bulletin.

<p>London: Last night, British planes fiercely bombed German bases on the French coast. The scale of the bombing was no less than the bombing of Hamburg from Friday night to Saturday morning. British military circles stated that the British Air Force has a new spirit of attack, which seems to refer to this. Last night, other squadrons of British planes flew into Germany and fiercely attacked important German industrial centers again. The Bremen radio station stopped broadcasting last night, indicating that the area may have been a target for British planes. According to Dover news, last night's British bombing of German bases and one of the largest offensives taken by the British Air Force against French coastal cities. The bombing of Hamburg on Friday and Sunday, according to the British, has turned most of the second largest city and Germany's main port into scorched earth. Docks, oil plants, and other military targets were all destroyed by British bombs. (International News Service, 17th)</p>

<h3 id="e45">A Painful History of the European War (3) The Three Protagonists of the French Tragedy (2) Gan Molin Who Can See But Can't Do <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>This article analyzes the personality of the second protagonist in the French tragedy, namely General Gan Molin, the Allied Commander-in-Chief. The original article is also from the pen of the famous French writer Jules Romains, published in the American "Saturday Evening Post." It is now translated as follows:</p>
<p>Some say that economics must be gradual to have value. Indeed, my experience of getting along with generals lacks sequential progress, and it is not worth delving into deeply.</p>
<p>For many years, apart from the experience I gained when I was a soldier, I can say that I gained nothing. As a soldier, when you see a sergeant, you think he is amazing. Even if you don't feel uneasy in front of him, you still have a sense of awe. Seeing a captain is like a distant mountain peak, visible but unattainable. As for generals, they are even more like divine dragons in the sky, impossible to fathom.</p>
<p>Speaking of my interactions with sergeants, the first officer I came into contact with was Wei Gang, who was then the Director-General of the Army, and could become the Commander-in-Chief in wartime. That was still seven years ago.</p>
<p>That day, my friend hosted a banquet, and Wei Gang and I were at the same table. He suspected that I was a leftist, and the host immediately explained that I was definitely not a leftist, but just had an open mind and was interested in everything.</p>
<p>After the meal, only the two of us remained in the garden, so we had a private conversation. He had the demeanor of a scholarly general, courteous and amiable, completely different from ordinary officers. His gentle elegance was like a maiden, but in fact, it would be difficult to find such a person even among women!</p>
<p>After the pleasantries, I directly asked him what the position of the air force would be in the upcoming great war. Readers should not misunderstand and think that I had foresight. In fact, it was only because I usually liked to read expert articles in newspapers and magazines, and I had been exposed to them for a long time, so I naturally blurted out that those writers all believed that the progress of the air force had changed modern warfare, and that having many soldiers was not reliable, but only relying on the air force was. The air force theory of Italian General Douhet was often cited. Many French politicians advocated that instead of extending the micro-military system, it would be better to save money and create an invincible air force. Even leftists and extreme leftists held this view, and there were indeed many. Others warned that because Germany had no right to build military aircraft, it turned to large commercial aircraft. Once something happened, they could be converted into bombers.</p>
<p>At that time, Wei Gang replied in a cautious tone: "This concept should not be ignored. But the air force is not enough to determine the victory or defeat of the war. To seize victory, you must occupy the position. The air force cannot do this now, let alone ever."</p>
<p>He also talked about how the air force needed a base not far from the front line, and the various restrictions that resulted from this.</p>
<p>Although he did not say that the infantry was always the "darling of war," nor did he mention any stale clichés, it was clear from his words that he did not believe that modern mechanized equipment could reform tactics and strategy.</p>
<p>On the same day, Wei Gang talked with his guests, saying that he would soon reach the age of retirement, but he was reluctant to cling to his position. He said that the regulations for the promotion of young officers were fundamentally very good.</p>
<p>Although Wei Gang was old, he was still well-groomed, energetic, and strong, and many young men were probably not up to par. Seeing him ride his horse and gallop dozens of miles in an instant made people envious.</p>
<p>Therefore, when saying goodbye, I admired his character very much, but I secretly hoped that he would not have the slightest bit of "cavalry coloring."</p>
<p>In 1914, some generals did not know what was important and thought that it would not be difficult to sweep away the famous German heavy artillery with cavalry charges. The so-called "cavalry coloring" was a witty remark I used to ridicule those generals.</p>
<p>Not long after that, someone came to visit, which was not without significance for France's future. This happened in the second half of 1934.</p>
<p>The guest's name was Lieutenant Colonel Diderle, a confidant of General Wei Gang, who carried a magazine containing an article written by Diderle. He said: "As long as you are happy, you may as well offer some opinions, and he will be happy to accept them." The title was "New Military Theory," and the writing and ideas were remarkable. I never knew what his intention was, but I only recently understood. It turned out that General Gergol's famous book was published in 1934. At that time, very few people knew about it, and I had never heard of such a book, but it attracted a lot of attention in the military. Later, after reading this book, I realized that the article written by Lieutenant Colonel Diderle (the reader should remember that he was General Wei Gang's confidant) was completely aimed at Gergol, and pointed out that Gergol's proposal to train a specialized professional army for independent operations when necessary was quite dangerous.</p>
<p>Let's put aside Wei Gang and talk about Gan Molin in the following article.</p>
<p>I can't remember clearly when and where I first met Gan Molin. I probably met him at a social gathering, or maybe I first met him at a banquet!</p>
<p>When the war clouds were looming, everyone who paid attention to the issue of war and peace could not help but look at the supreme general to whom the fate of the country was tied with different eyes. My friendly ministers also repeatedly mentioned that in times of crisis, the opinion of the General Staff had a great impact on national policy. For example, when Hitler marched into the Rhineland in 1936, the French cabinet was divided into two factions, one advocating a strong response, and the other advocating a wait-and-see approach. When the General Staff spoke, the dispute was resolved. The General Staff said: "If you really want to go to the Rhineland, you have to mobilize. We have neither an expeditionary force nor the ability to quickly assemble troops." Therefore, the cabinet hesitated, thinking that it could not mobilize five million people to take on this simple police work.</p>
<p>Gergol had already published a book two years ago, strongly advocating the importance of training a standing expeditionary corps, and explained that France, because of its lack of this kind of strength, only sought temporary security in the face of difficulties, and watched peace gradually erode, until it was forced into the vortex and had to fight in the worst environment, and then realized that it was too late to regret it. Since Gergol's opinion was ignored by the General Staff, the lessons of the Rhineland incident could not attract their attention either. After the danger passed, they put the urgent need to build an expeditionary force behind them, knowing that the parliament would not make things difficult, but they refused to submit it for discussion.</p>
<p>For these many reasons, as long as I had the good fortune to meet Gan Molin, I would try to talk to him a few words, whether before or after dinner.</p>
<p>Gan Molin was humble and humorous, and it can be said that no one could compare to him. He was always very leisurely and comfortable. As soon as you came into contact with him, he would immediately make you feel the same way. If you couldn't remember the first time you met him, it was because he treated everyone, old and new acquaintances, as if they had known each other for a long time. If you had been separated from him for several months, and then shook hands with him to catch up, he would always be as cordial as if he talked to you every day. If you left the room with him, he would always let you go first, unless you insisted on not doing so, he would reluctantly go first, with a smile on his face, as if to say, "Well, this is the right of us old people!" He was neither tall nor short, of medium build, with rosy and delicate skin, lively and alert eyes, but quite kind, soft and sparse hair, and a slightly reddish color. He had a short mustache on his mouth, and not many wrinkles on his forehead. He had a calm appearance, hiding his emotions. His body was not very strong. His conversation was witty, and his tone was pleasant. When others spoke, he always listened attentively, without interrupting or rebutting. You would definitely think that you agreed with someone like this who did not easily offend others. It's just that he seemed to have magic power. At the end of the conversation, you didn't know that your words had satisfied him, and you didn't know that he had persuaded you invisibly.</p>
<p>One day, I asked him about the German army's preparations for war.</p>
<p>He replied: "Germany is indeed working very hard, and the effect is not without merit. It's just that the old troops have been disbanded, and conscription is yet to be implemented. During this transition period, the shortcomings in training are difficult to remedy."</p>
<p>He also talked about the fact that Germany lacked well-trained officers, especially a group of junior officers, who could not be cultivated for a while. He also believed that the traditional relationship between the German senior staff and the General Staff had been broken, and had become more acute due to the political reforms of the army.</p>
<p>"I think there are probably very few active-duty generals and colonels in the German army who participated in the war in 1914-1918, and almost all of our generals are division commanders from 1914. It is really commendable to have such rich experience."</p>
<p>Later, the conversation turned to the air force, and he dismissed the issue with a few simple sentences. He said that France was still in a transitional period, and we must catch up quickly. His words revealed that he was not responsible for this, as if to say, "Mistakes and negligence have nothing to do with me."</p>
<p>He never talked about the equipment of the army. But he seemed very satisfied. His prudence seemed to reassure people. I had never seen him express anything, or be silent, or sigh, which could make people feel that he seemed to want to say, "I have a lot to say, but..." or say, "Since you are so close to the public opinion circles and cabinet members, you can wake them up and say that we lack the necessary materials. If we don't hurry up and work hard, it will cause endless troubles." He was always unperturbed.</p>
<p>He rarely talked about himself, nor did he talk about the past. But others liked to talk about him and praised him highly. After the outbreak of the Great War, Gan Molin was always in the staff of General Joffre, and he can be said to be the most unknown but most capable talent, and he was deeply trusted by General Joffre. It is said that Gan Molin drafted the plan for the Battle of the Marne and prompted General Joffre to order the counterattack. His achievements in the Great War showed his ability to adapt, be prudent, and know the opportunity. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e46">Washington Observer Points Out that the United States Has a Tendency to Break Off Diplomatic Relations with Germany, Has Prepared to Investigate German Consulates and News Agencies, and Germany, Italy, and Japan Are Trying to Prevent the United States from Rearming <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Washington According to the opinions of some very qualified observers here, the United States now has a tendency to break off diplomatic relations with Germany. Secretary of State Hull gave the Committee to Investigate Non-Americans' Activities in the United States a free hand, which is very meaningful. Because the United States has never lightly wanted to thoroughly investigate, fearing that the announcement of the results of the investigation will cause a public outcry for the severance of diplomatic relations with Germany. It is said that people in the official arena privately told others that American representatives stationed in Germany felt it difficult to obtain information, so the United States should not allow Germans to have complete freedom to obtain information in the United States. At the same time, the committee investigating foreigners' activities has now prepared to investigate German consulates and German news agencies. It is expected that a white paper will be published on Tuesday, proving that Germany, Italy, Japan, and the Soviet Union are currently working in the United States to obstruct the United States from rearming and transporting supplies to the United Kingdom. Dies has made a statement on this matter, saying that according to what he has heard, if the committee discloses the evidence it has obtained, Hitler is prepared to ask the United States to recall some of its consular representatives stationed in Germany and occupied areas as retaliation. (17th Reuters)</p>
<p>Washington German leader Hitler has planned to retaliate against the investigation made by Dies, chairman of the Committee to Investigate Non-American Activities in the United States. It is reported that Dies has written a 500-page white paper, which mainly describes the espionage activities of German consuls and Hitler's agents. The report can be published once it is approved by other members. In addition, he has also written a report on the activities of Italian special envoys, which will also be published later.

<p>Lyon Since the German authorities in Lorraine Province ordered the residents of French descent in the province to move out of the country on the 11th of this month, five trains a day have been carrying these refugees, arriving here, resting at the station for a few hours, and then continuing to the French Free Zone, in order to find a place to live for these refugees. Bishop Henz of Metz was ordered by the German authorities in Lorraine Province to leave immediately a month ago, and now he spends the whole day at the train station here, comforting the refugees and encouraging them not to be discouraged by this. As for the spirit of these refugees, they are all very strong and express full confidence in the future. According to news from the city of Toulouse, a large number of refugees have arrived in the southwestern provinces of France. Among them, 900 people got off the train in the city of Montauban, and 1,250 people got off the train in the city of Auch, west of the city of Toulouse. The local people expressed a warm welcome to these refugees. In addition, according to news from the city of Vichy, the cabinet convened an interim cabinet meeting, chaired by President Petain himself, and Agriculture Minister Jacques reported that the government had taken various measures to help farmers and workers in Lorraine Province re-establish their homes in the Free Zone.

<p>Vichy Five trains a day carrying French-speaking people expelled from Lorraine Province by the Germans pass through Lyon. Swiss people have expressed the opinion that the power of the free movement in France will be further strengthened due to the German action in Lorraine Province, and the resentment towards the Petain government will also be greater. The Swiss newspaper Vichy's dispatch said that not only the residents of the Moselle Province, which was obtained from Germany in 1918, were expelled, but also the residents of other places originally belonging to France were also expelled.

<p>The Shanghai Relief Orphanage for Refugee Children recently held the United Cup Charity Basketball Tournament, the Charity Basketball Challenge, the Daqian Cup Charity Basketball Tournament, and the First Huai De Cup Charity Football Tournament. The ticket proceeds and accounts have not been announced. In addition, Dean Lu Wenshao has left Shanghai, and there has been a lot of criticism in the public opinion. The matter concerns the cause of caring for children and urgently needs to clarify the content and announce it to the public. The reporter of Dihua News Agency specially visited Mr. Yuan Ludeng, chairman of the orphanage, and asked about everything. He was kind enough to release the detailed remarks as follows:</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a lot of criticism in the public opinion about the Orphanage for Refugee Children. The rumors spread can be said to be like Zeng Shen killing people. I, as the chairman of the orphanage, bear a heavy responsibility and cannot remain silent in order to correct the great elegance. After reviewing the recent criticisms from the public opinion circles of the Orphanage for Refugee Children, they can be divided into the following points: (1) Doubts about the orphanage's stance, especially regarding the current situation of Dean Lu Wenshao; (2) The orphanage's financial situation has been rumored to be unclear, and it is hoped that it will be publicly announced; (3) Doubts about the recent charity competition accounts, suspecting that there is corruption, so they have not been announced; (4) The so-called complex inside story. In summary, the attacks on the orphanage recently are based on the above points. I will now answer in detail as follows. I believe that the origin of the remarks will be self-defeating.</p>
<p>Stance Issue</p>
<p>The purpose of the orphanage's founding is, on the one hand, to relieve the refugee children who have suffered in this war, and on the other hand, to cultivate the future masters of China. Since the orphanage was established, it has been two years. All construction and recurring expenses have relied on the continuous input of philanthropists from all walks of life. Although the expenses have been exhausted to the point of extreme panic, it has not accepted subsidies from any party. Since the orphanage's lifeline and spare money are not controlled by others, the orphanage's solemn stance can be independent. As for Dean Lu Wenshao's departure from Shanghai, it is because he personally lacked a definite goal, and Lu's personal actions cannot change the orphanage's solemn stance. Now the position of dean has been concurrently held by myself, and I will even more uphold the spirit of charity and adhere to a firm and solemn stance. I have always held the principle of not being an official and not loving money for decades as one day, which should be recognized by society. The orphanage's stance issue should be clearly understood by all walks of life.</p>
<p>Financial Status</p>
<p>The orphanage now houses more than 630 refugee children. There are no fixed funds for economic expenses. It relies solely on external donations to barely maintain. The financial situation is absolutely transparent. Regarding income, in addition to publishing announcements in newspapers, regarding expenses, even the slightest amount must be reviewed, signed, and stamped by the relevant departments, and the auditing department makes a preliminary review every month. The consulting accountant of the orphanage then sends auditors to the orphanage to conduct a detailed audit of the accounts, make a report, and then submit it to the consulting accountant of the orphanage for careful review, and then submit it to me for review. In addition, all donations from all walks of life are sent to the bank for registration, and the expenditure funds are signed by me and the director-general to facilitate auditing and show solemnity. Now, in order to demonstrate great faith, it is decided to invite reporters from various newspapers to visit the orphanage this week to clarify the details.</p>
<p>Charity Game Accounts</p>
<p>Thanks to the support of all sectors of society, the charity competitions organized by the orphanage include (1) the United Cup Charity Basketball Tournament, (2) the Charity Basketball Challenge, (3) the Daqian Cup Charity Basketball Tournament, and (4) the First Huai De Cup Charity Football Tournament. I am especially grateful to Mr. Jiang Shilin for his efforts in running around and contacting. In terms of other small balls, there are donations from the finals of the Youth Cup, as well as the Wenbin Cup small ball game introduced by Mr. Jiang. In terms of table tennis, there is the Zongjing Cup finals ticket donation introduced by Mr. Chen Linsheng. At present, in addition to the four items of the United Cup, the Youth Cup, the Wenbin Cup, and the Zongjing Cup, the accounts have been published in the front-page advertisements of Shen Xin, and the others have not been announced because the funds have not been fully collected and are still waiting to be collected. However, they can be announced this week to show great faith. After checking the expenses of the orphanage's various competitions, the United Cup was generally donated by the Paramount Sports Club and Mr. Zhu Daxun. The expenses of the three competitions of the Youth Cup, the Wenbin Cup, and the Zongjing Cup were also donated by the responsible parties of each competition, so the ticket proceeds were not touched. Regarding the Daqian Cup and the Huai De Cup, they were also generally donated by the Daqian Boxing Club and the Lido Sports Club and Mr. Gao Huailiang. Although there were entertainment expenses, the ticket proceeds and the money from the auction of charity rackets were never touched. Therefore, except for the necessary expenses of the challenge, which were borne by the orphanage, the other charity competitions held in the past were all generously donated by major benefactors to benefit the orphanage.</p>
<p>Inside Story</p>
<p>Regarding the rumors about the inside story of the orphanage, there are subtle points that cannot be analyzed in a few words, but facts speak louder than words. Therefore, I plan to invite journalists to visit the orphanage for an on-site inspection in the near future, and they can make more specific instructions on all the orphanage's measures. Whether it is the so-called economic situation or the so-called complex problems, they can be solved easily, which is better than exhausting the bamboo of Nanshan to make a written defense. In the future, I hope that the public opinion circles will consider the education and upbringing of more than 600 refugee children, and add solemn criticism and righteous revelation to correct my shortcomings and lack of oversight. Before the facts are clearly revealed, I still pray for solemn publication of honest opinions, so that the cause of caring for children that cultivates national power can rely on prosperity. Not only will I be grateful, but it will also be a blessing for the country and society.</p>

Fei Chunhua is in Great Form, Scoring Three Goals Alone Yesterday. <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>In yesterday's First Division Western Union Football League match, Tung Wah decisively defeated Lusitano again at the Recreation Ground, achieving a remarkable record of six wins in six games. The result was 7-2, with the score being 4-1 at halftime. Tung Wah's right winger, Jia Youliang, was absent due to injury and was replaced by Fei Chunhua. Fei performed exceptionally well yesterday, not only running quickly but also shooting accurately, making it one of the best performances of the match. The stalemate lasted for twenty-two minutes after the start of the match. When Cai Shengsen left the field due to a left wrist injury, Tung Wah became very active. Fei Chunhua scored two goals in a row with a hook and a header. Li Yichen then added another goal. Shortly after, Lusitano was penalized with a penalty kick, which Li converted, putting Tung Wah ahead with a score of 4-0. Under pressure, Lusitano broke through and Hui Lai scored a goal, ending the first half with a score of 4-1. After the break, Lusitano scored first, but Fei Chunhua retaliated for Tung Wah. Li Yichen also added a goal, and finally, center forward Dai scored another goal single-handedly.</p>

<p>Scoring Four Goals in One Go</p>
<p>Referee Sinclair. After Lusitano kicked off, their five forwards entered Tung Wah's territory and made several attempts to score, but they were all saved by Qin Bigao. Soon after, Zhuang Youren accidentally committed a foul, but fortunately, it was outside the penalty area. Lusitano's Xiang Nabaoer, eager for success, was too hasty and kicked the ball high. Tung Wah's center forward Dai received the ball and passed it to Wan Jin on the left, but Wan's attempt to score went out of bounds, missing a good opportunity. At this time, both sides exchanged attacks, but neither could score until the 20th minute when Cai Shengsen was injured in his left wrist after being hit by a foreign player while trying to save the ball, and had to leave the field to rest. Tung Wah fought with ten men, and all three armies fought bravely, implementing a total counterattack across the entire line. Li Yichen made a wonderful shot, and Fei Chunhua, waiting right in front of the goal, headed the ball in, breaking the deadlock. The atmosphere in the whole stadium was electric. Immediately after, center forward Dai intercepted the ball and passed it remotely to Wan Jin. Wan dribbled the ball and passed it to the right. Fei Chunhua pulled up and threw the ball again, and again it hit the target, beautifully and clearly, making the score 2-0. It was only 25 minutes into the game. Lusitano, having lost two goals in a row, was unwilling to accept defeat and advanced with the ball, but was blocked back by Tung Wah. Lusitano's Jack committed a foul and was penalized with a free kick. Liang Shutang took the free kick, and Fei Chunhua headed the ball, but it was palmed away by Moso Guff into a corner kick. Fei kicked the ball in, just right, and Li Yichen lightly headed it into the net, making the score 3-0. Lusitano, eager for revenge, Hanik violently bumped into Dai Linjing in the penalty area. Sinclair enforced the law impartially, and a penalty kick was awarded, which Li Yichen, acting as the executioner, kicked the ball into the net, with Moso Guff unable to save it, creating an advantage of 4-0. Lusitano was four goals behind. Until the 41st minute, Lusitano's Bulaite advanced quickly on the left and passed the ball to Hui Lai, who rushed up and shot, and Qin Bigao was unable to react in time. 4-1, Lusitano broke the duck egg record, ending the first half.</p>
<p>Defense Crumbles, Lusitano Suffers a Crushing Defeat</p>
<p>After the lemon break, the sides changed again, and Tung Wah took the offensive immediately after the kickoff. Fei passed to center forward Dai, whose attempt to score was palmed out by Moso Guff with both hands. Dai received the ball again and lightly passed it to Huang Kehou, who kicked it out of bounds, missing a frequent good opportunity. The inner guards were in a tight spot. Lusitano's Kapustin advanced on the border, and Simmons caught up with the ball and hooked it in with one kick. Hui Lai scored a header, reducing the score to 2-4. Lusitano's offensive seemed to have a turnaround, but Tung Wah's defense was impenetrable, and the Tung Wah forwards were very active. In the 16th minute, Mata knocked down Fei Chunhua and was penalized with a penalty kick, which was still taken by Li Yichen, but it was palmed out by Moso Guff with one hand. Li rushed up and kicked it into the empty net, making the score 5-2. After that, Tung Wah always controlled the whole game. In the 22nd minute, Wan Jin and Li Yichen contacted and advanced with the ball. Center forward Dai held the ball and, without seeking personal glory, passed it to Fei Chunhua, who had a flash of inspiration and lightly pushed it into the net, creating a huge score of 6-2. Then, Fei Chunhua had another wonderful hooking shot, and Yichen wanted to head the ball, but the ball fell at A Dai's feet. Dai raised his foot and kicked the ball into the net. After that, Tung Wah missed a few empty goal opportunities. Fei Chunhua dribbled the ball to the territory, and Dai shot, but it bounced off Moso Guff's leg. Wan Jin rushed up and tried to score again, but it hit Mata's foot. I would have entered, but the counterattack was ineffective. Tung Wah's Fei Chunhua Dai center father-shaped active, selling around 30 yards. Kicking the door, Cao Sogufu fell to the ground to save, his hands touched the ball and the ball bounced to the left, hit the goal post and bounced out, several performances of mutiny, Lusitano's internal emptiness, Dai Linjing took the opportunity to single-handedly, straight to Huanglong, the time reported the end, Tung Wah won 7 to 2,</p>

<h3 id="e56">Issues of Commercial Firm Deposits and Domestic Remittances <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Li Jiang</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>It is reported that the Shanghai City Advanced Council and the Silver and Money Trades Association received instructions from the Ministry of Finance to strictly prohibit ordinary commercial firms from concurrently engaging in deposit-taking or handling remittances. Notices have already been issued to member trade associations and all banks and money shops to comply with this regulation, and rewards will be given for reporting violations, which will be severely investigated. The implication of this policy is actually about the current capital issue, which is worthy of discussion.</p>
<p>Since the internal migration of the August 13th Incident, the population in Shanghai has become concentrated, and banks from various regions have withdrawn to Shanghai. Furthermore, due to the instability of the situation in Europe and the West, overseas capital has flocked to Shanghai, making this international free market a place for capital concentration. However, on the other hand, Shanghai's industry and commerce are in an abnormal state. Investment targets are limited to small and medium-sized businesses. In the face of the ever-changing situation, who is willing to make fixed investments? As a result, Shanghai capital has a sense of having no way out, and floating capital in the market is abundant, leading to the flourishing of various investment phenomena. Among these phenomena, various abnormal financial developments have also occurred. The deposit-taking and remittance-handling by commercial firms discussed here is one such example.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>The concurrent operation of deposit businesses by ordinary commercial firms has a long history, but it is even more prevalent today than in the past. According to the Banking Law promulgated in 1931, Article 1 stipulates that anyone engaged in deposit-taking, lending, remittance, or discounting bills is a bank, and those who do not use the name "bank" are regarded as banks. If ordinary commercial firms concurrently engage in deposit businesses, they should be subject to the jurisdiction of various financial regulations. Although the law could not be implemented due to various reasons after its promulgation, larger merchants strategically allocated a sum of funds attached to a bank branch specifically for deposit matters (such as a large company in Shanghai). However, since the issue of floating capital arose in Shanghai, the trend of speculation and hoarding has become increasingly prevalent. As long as a way is found to raise funds to purchase and hoard goods, huge profits can be made in a short period. Therefore, merchants are competing to raise funds, and attracting deposits is one way for them to do so. Therefore, the development of deposit businesses by ordinary commercial firms during wartime can also be regarded as a phenomenon incidentally produced by the excess of floating capital and the rise of speculation. We believe that this phenomenon needs to be suppressed.</p>
<p>First, in order to strengthen the power of financial control, the Ministry of Finance recently promulgated the "Temporary Measures for Managing Banks in Extraordinary Times." Article 1 of the measures reiterated the provisions of the Banking Law, stating that anyone engaged in deposit-taking, lending, bill discounting, remittance, or pawnbroking without the name "bank" is regarded as a bank. According to this provision, deposit-taking commercial firms should also be considered a type of bank, and their establishment should comply with various financial regulations and be registered with the Ministries of Economic Affairs and Finance. However, in fact, these commercial firms have their own businesses and cannot be reorganized into banks. Deposit-taking is merely a means of their financial turnover. Therefore, deposit-taking commercial firms cannot be supervised by various financial regulations, and the interests of depositors cannot be reliably protected.</p>
<p>Second, the "Temporary Measures for Managing Banks in Extraordinary Times" stipulate that banks should use deposits to invest in production and construction projects and joint production and sales projects in principle, and should not directly engage in commerce or hoard goods. However, after commercial firms take deposits, they are essentially directly engaged in commerce, and we cannot know their use or prevent them from using the deposits for speculation and hoarding. At a time when the trend of speculation and hoarding is extremely prevalent, we must take precautions and prevent floating capital from entering improper channels.</p>
<p>Third, according to Article 2 of the "Temporary Measures for Managing Banks," in addition to savings deposits, which should be handled in accordance with the Savings Bank Law, ordinary deposits received by banks should have 20% of the deposit amount as a reserve, which should be deposited in any of the four major banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China) in the local area, and the receiving bank should give appropriate interest. The intention is nothing more than (1) to protect the safety of depositors and prevent bank runs in emergencies, (2) to prevent the improper use of funds in commercial banks, and (3) to strengthen the state bank's power to control credit. However, since deposit-taking ordinary commercial firms cannot be regarded as banks in fact, the above regulations cannot be applied. In other words, the result is to weaken the government's power to control the market.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, it is appropriate for the Ministry of Finance to issue instructions to strictly suppress the deposit-taking of commercial firms.</p>
<p>However, in terms of actual circumstances, not to mention whether the government's power can fully extend to Shanghai, it is not easy to completely prohibit commercial firms from taking deposits. This is because most of the deposits absorbed by commercial firms are based on personal relationships, and outsiders cannot interfere. This is one reason. The interest rate on deposits absorbed by commercial firms is often higher than that of banks, and now banks are even considering reducing deposit interest rates. This is another reason. Even if someone reports it, commercial firms can find ways to confuse the accounting items. For example, if it is clearly a deposit item, in order to avoid the term "deposit," they may change it to "borrowed funds" or other items, and with a change, they can avoid the interference of legislation. This is a third reason. With these three reasons, the Ministry of Finance's instructions may not be easy to implement. Therefore, there is one more thing that we should study.</p>
<p>Currently, banks in Shanghai are launching a campaign to reduce deposit interest rates, and some banks have already formally implemented it. The reason is that they are distressed that current deposits account for 70% of the deposits they receive. After banks receive these funds, they suffer from a lack of investment targets, and fixed investments. Therefore, in addition to using these funds for speculative purposes, they can only passively spend interest and increase their own burden. Thus, they have no choice but to reduce interest rates. However, in our opinion, the interest rate reduction is an opportunity for commercial firms to take deposits. We believe that the interest rate on current deposits may be slightly reduced, but the interest rate on fixed deposits should not only not be reduced, but should also be increased. Since current deposits account for 70% of total deposits, the only key is to change the nature of the deposits and find ways to convert current deposits into fixed deposits. Therefore, reducing the interest rate on current deposits and increasing the interest rate on fixed deposits is one way to increase fixed deposits. If fixed deposits can be substantially increased, banks can use this method to absorb a portion of the floating capital and transfer it to the mainland, while also preventing the floating capital from being absorbed by ordinary commercial firms.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>In the autumn of last year, the government internally wanted to restrict the flow of funds to Shanghai and had established the "Four Banks' Domestic Remittance Review Office." Prior to this, it had already restricted the remittance of funds from the mainland to Shanghai and had also stipulated the maximum amount of funds that could be remitted to Shanghai. In March of this year, it promulgated the "Provisional Measures for Facilitating Domestic Remittances," which mainly included three points: (1) remittances from ports to the mainland are free of charge, (2) remittances between the mainland are subject to the exchange rate set by the Ministry of Finance, and (3) remittances from the mainland to ports are limited to the amount for daily necessities set by the Ministry of Finance and must be reviewed by the Four Banks' Domestic Remittance Review Office. However, due to Shanghai's trade surplus with the mainland and various reasons such as capital flight, the amount of funds smuggled from the mainland to Shanghai is extremely large, resulting in a black market for domestic remittances. In Shanghai, there is even the phenomenon of so-called "fee-based remittances," and ordinary commercial firms often openly solicit remittances in newspapers.</p>
<p>It is originally welcomed by the government if ordinary merchants can assist financial institutions in promoting the internal transfer of funds. Even in terms of the actual situation, there are reasons for merchants to operate fee-based remittances. This is because after merchants ship goods to the mainland, it is difficult to remit payment for those goods. Therefore, merchants handle fee-based remittances in Shanghai purely out of the motive to mobilize funds. In fact, merchants have long had the habit of mutual netting. Only the difference that cannot be leveled after the netting is entrusted to the bank for remittance. This certainly has a considerable reason, but on closer analysis, the current situation is not entirely so. The government encourages fee-based remittances to the mainland, referring to legitimate commercial banks, not special commercial firms. Fee-based remittances are certainly personal freedom, but since they are openly solicited in newspapers, their scope is no longer limited to merchants in the two places. The impact on society will inevitably be great. According to the aforementioned regulations for the administration of banks, the merchant is regarded as a bank when operating remittance business, and the business must be subject to the supervision of the Ministry of Finance to ensure the safety of customers. Nowadays, the merchant operates remittances with fees, which are not subject to financial regulations, and its business and financial condition are difficult for outsiders to understand. At the same time, those who want to remit to the mainland can entrust the bank to remit on their behalf, so that Shanghai will reduce the amount of hot money, but now they are ignored by the legitimate financial institutions due to the inducement of merchants at high prices, regardless of how merchants intercept funds flowing to the mainland. It is possible to apply to the Domestic Remittance Audit Office in the Mainland for legal procedures to maintain operations. The problem can be solved. It is not necessary to create another method for operating financial business without authorization. This is probably the purpose of the Ministry of Finance’s decree to strictly prohibit ordinary merchants from operating remittances this time?</p>
<p>Here we have one question to consider: If merchants are not allowed to operate remittance business, then the funds stranded in the mainland will not be remitted back to Shanghai. As a result, general merchants will suffer from the pain of ineffective turnover, and it will be difficult to expect Shanghai goods to be imported into the mainland. For this reason, the Four Banks’ Domestic Remittance Audit Office should, from reality, make it easier to audit and give convenience to the remittance of genuine necessities, and even grant convenience for a part of the remittance based on the nature of the goods. This is probably a way to take into account both government orders and popular sentiments.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Regarding the Treasury Bill Plan <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Xizhang</p>
<p>Since the currency system reform, the idea of issuing treasury bills has surfaced from time to time in the market. It seems that whenever the market undergoes a change, this plan tends to become popular again. Recently, spurred by rumors of a certain party establishing a "bank," this idea has become prevalent once more. It is rumored that the plan involves: (1) treasury bills denominated in gold coins, (2) each treasury bill equivalent to four legal tender dollars, (3) the exchange rate of treasury bills against the US dollar at 16 yuan per 100 yuan, (4) after the implementation of this plan, legal tender will no longer be able to purchase foreign exchange. Those who believe this rumor argue that after the "bank" of a certain party is established, it will inevitably issue inconvertible paper money and use this inconvertible "paper" money to exchange for foreign exchange held in legal tender, thus enabling the conversion of legal tender into foreign exchange. Therefore, the government has no choice but to adopt the treasury bill method to counter it.</p>
<p>This is a rumor and not worth discussing in reality. What we want to discuss here is the hypothetical situation. Assuming the Chinese government really promulgated the "Treasury Bill Ordinance," would such a plan have any impact on the financial situation? How would this plan be evaluated?</p>
<p>The "issuance of treasury bills" can be interpreted in two ways: one as a new type of national bond and the other as a currency system reform. We assume the latter.</p>
<p>First, we need to provide a brief introduction to China's current foreign exchange policy. The free convertibility of legal tender into foreign exchange is indeed a loophole in the legal tender policy. The possible existence of this loophole is mainly due to the existence of the Shanghai foreign exchange market, which the government has no way to control. At the same time, the government allows the existence of the black market, presumably to enhance the credibility of legal tender abroad. However, to prevent capital flight, strict foreign exchange controls must be adopted. Therefore, the current foreign exchange system has evolved into two parallel measures: (1) The foreign exchange policy is, in principle, a management policy, with import and export exchange subject to strict government control. The exchange rate temporarily abandons the official rate of one shilling two pence halfpenny against the British pound, and uses the exchange rate quoted by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. (2) For occupied areas, mainly Shanghai, because the central government's decrees cannot be fully controlled for the time being, the exchange rate is allowed to fluctuate freely, with appropriate adjustments made within the possible range. These two points are the main pillars of our current foreign exchange system. Therefore, in the exchange market directly managed by the Chinese government, the exchange rate is absolutely balanced. The volatile exchange rate that people often refer to refers to the Shanghai exchange rate. The exchange market where foreign exchange resources are easily seized refers to the black market.</p>
<p>Understanding these two points, although we do not know whether the government has a so-called treasury bill plan, we can determine that the implementation of the treasury bill plan will not help the current policy. From the perspective of the interior, the exchange rate is originally absolutely stable, and the issuance of treasury bills has nothing to do with the inland exchange rate. Because this is a formal change, not a substantial one. If the purpose of issuing treasury bills is to deal with the black market, assuming that, as the rumor suggests, every four legal tender dollars are equal to one treasury bill, then 100 yuan of treasury bills is equivalent to 16 US dollars, and 100 yuan of legal tender is equal to 4 US dollars. The exchange rate of legal tender still exists. If it is said that at that time, only treasury bills can freely purchase foreign exchange, while legal tender cannot, then the government only needs to abolish the policy of maintaining the black market to achieve the above goal, without going through the stage of issuing treasury bills. In short, even without treasury bills, the government can absolutely manage the outflow of foreign exchange. In Shanghai, even if treasury bills are issued separately, the buying and selling of legal tender in the foreign exchange black market cannot be prohibited. May I ask if treasury bills will flow to Shanghai? If they only circulate in the interior, then the interior does not need them at all. If they circulate in Shanghai, then how are they different from legal tender? Even if the government immediately abandons the policy of maintaining the black market, the buying and selling of legal tender can still exist in Shanghai. For example, British pound banknotes have been ordered to be withdrawn by the British government, but the exchange rate of British pound banknotes against legal tender in Shanghai still exists. Although legal tender is Chinese currency and the British pound is foreign currency, the situation is different. However, in the current special environment of Shanghai, it is very appropriate to take the British pound as an example. May I ask, if the British government issued a treasury bill, would it have any impact on the current British pound policy? The transformation of a currency policy lies in substance, not in name. This is the most basic argument.</p>
<p>According to our ideal, we naturally hope that the government can directly control the foreign exchange black market in Shanghai, so that foreign exchange resources, little by little, all belong to the state and there is no risk of being seized. As for why the current foreign exchange black market cannot be eliminated, it is because the government cannot directly control the Shanghai black market. Because it cannot be controlled and cannot be eliminated, the existence or non-existence of treasury bills cannot enhance the power of the current foreign exchange policy. This can be asserted.</p>
<p>As for the future, if "paper" money is issued, it will undoubtedly be a plunder of the people. The only way for people with assets to protect themselves is to remit legal tender to the interior to obtain the safest guarantee.</p>
<p>The treasury bill plan has only one possibility, and that is when the government has a comprehensive plan to stabilize the exchange market. Assuming that after the end of the war, a government believes that currency should establish another standard, it will assume another unit outside the circulating currency. For example, Soviet Russia once used the Chervoonet in 1922 to reorganize the gold ruble, with a ratio of ten rubles equal to one chervoonet. If in the current China, the treasury bill plan is not needed in fact. According to the government's current foreign exchange policy, we can find a clue to know that the government will inevitably adopt a certain standard to stabilize the exchange market after the war. Do we not have two official exchange rates today? Why does the government set up a Bank of China exchange rate in addition to the legal exchange rate? According to our speculation, the legal price is unchanged, while the Bank of China exchange rate can be changed. At present, the government is using the Bank of China exchange rate for emergency adjustments. When the time is right, in other words, when it can control the exchange market, it will then consider the legal price, whether to raise it, lower it, or keep it unchanged. The final observation of the so-called treasury bill plan is nothing more than this.</p>
<p>However, why does the rumor of treasury bills only circulate in the market? According to our speculation, it is nothing more than: (1) Malicious people create rumors to mislead the shallow-minded into believing that the legal tender policy must be changed, thus shaking their faith in legal tender. (2) Perhaps there is a plan to reorganize the post-war currency, but it is only a suggestion, which may come from private individuals or experts, while the market fabricates facts out of thin air and changes the facts.</p>
<p>The research position of this article is still based on "assumptions." However, fundamentally, we believe that this kind of rumor may be of some interest in the speculative market, but it has no room for discussion in the entire currency system, because whether it exists or not, it will not change the essence of Chinese currency.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Calculation of Electricity in the French Concession <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Mo</p>
<p>In the previous issue of this publication, Mr. Huang Yunqian published a method for calculating electricity bills, which was entirely based on the price list of the American-owned Shanghai Power Company in the Public Concession. However, it is different from the price list of the French-owned Water and Electricity Company in the French Concession of this city. Here is a report on the calculation method of the French-owned Water and Electricity Company.</p>
<p>The electricity measurement of the French-owned Water and Electricity Company is calculated in Edouard Watt-hour (Hwh) units (commonly known as "small characters"), while the Shanghai Power Company uses Kilowatt-hour (Kwh) units (commonly known as "large characters"). The units are already different. (Because ten Edouard Watt-hours are equal to one Kilowatt-hour.) Therefore, the original price of electricity for lighting is only 1.3 cents per unit. Recently, from November 6th, a temporary surcharge of 97% has been added, which is 1.261 cents per unit. Then the total price per unit is 2.561 cents, which is equivalent to 3.582 cents in legal tender at the exchange rate of 0.715 yuan per silver dollar. However, this temporary surcharge of 97% will be issued successively on the December lighting bill. The current November bill still has a temporary surcharge of 60%, because the November bill still shows the electricity consumption in October.</p>
<p>As for electricity for power (commonly known as "motor electricity"), it is naturally cheaper than electricity for lighting. The original price per Hwh Edouard Watt-hour is 4.5 mills of silver. Now, a temporary surcharge of 4.365 mills per unit is added (the same as for lighting, 97%). In total, if the monthly usage reaches more than 300 hours and exceeds the rated electricity consumption, each unit exceeding the rated electricity consumption can also be reduced by 5 mills of silver (according to the original price).</p>
<p>In addition, electricity for heating, including electric stoves, electric irons, electric furnaces, etc., is even cheaper than electricity for power, at 5 mills per unit. The original price is 4 cents of silver per unit. Now, a 97% surcharge is added, which is 3.88 mills per unit. In total, each unit is 7.88 mills of silver, which is equivalent to 1.02 cents in legal tender.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to report on the method of calculating water bills. The water measurement of the French-owned Water and Electricity Company is also different from that of the Public Concession Water Company. The former is calculated in cubic meters, while the latter is calculated in gallons. In fact, each cubic meter of water is approximately equal to 220 gallons. The original price is 8.75 mills of silver. From November 6th, the temporary surcharge was also changed to 30%, which is 2.625 mills of silver. The total is 11.375 mills. Converting this at an exchange rate of 0.715 yuan of legal tender per silver dollar, then each cubic meter is 15.91 mills. However, if the usage is less than the rated cubic meters, a supplementary amount will be charged separately.</p>

<p>— Sheng Kai</p>
<p>November 16 (Continued)</p>
<p>The Bank of Japan's issuance system has been reformed three times in the same way. When Mr. Takahashi took office as Minister of Finance in 1932, he increased the guarantee limit for Bank of Japan banknotes from the historical 120 million yen to 1 billion yen, which was the first reform. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, inflation progressed rapidly, expanding from 1.64 billion yen at the end of June 1937 to 2.305 billion yen. The degree of expansion was difficult to control, so it had to recognize the facts and expand from 1 billion yen to 1.7 billion yen. However, after the evaluation of gold reserves, the gold reserves had been raised from 48.8 million yen to 800 million yen, so the substantial expansion of the guarantee reserve was no less than 1 billion yen, which was the second reform. However, since 1939, the Bank of Japan's issuance has increased unabated, reaching a record high of 3.679 billion yen at the end of the year, so in mid-April, the guarantee reserve was further expanded from 1.7 billion yen to 500 million yen, bringing the total to 2.2 billion yen, which was the third reform. However, the gold reserves have decreased from 800 million yen to 500 million yen. At the end of 1939, the amount of issuance beyond the limit still reached 970 million yen. Although the guarantee reserve amount has been expanded many times, at the end of October this year, the amount of issuance beyond the limit had reached 1.052 billion yen. No wonder the Governor of the Bank of Japan wants to reform the current issuance system!</p>
<p>However, the so-called highest issuance system and other possible currency management methods, according to the measures taken by Britain during this wartime, are nothing more than a full reserve guarantee system. On September 3, 1939, after Britain declared war on Germany, it transferred the gold reserves of the Bank of England into the Exchange Equalisation Account at an evaluation rate of 168 shillings, with 278 million pounds of gold. The remaining gold reserves in the issuing department were only 102,000 pounds. At the same time, the guaranteed issuance limit was raised from 300 million pounds to 580 million pounds. Therefore, the fundamental reform of the issuance system planned by the Bank of Japan is nothing more than transferring all of the nominal 500 million yen of gold reserves into exchange funds and raising the guaranteed reserve amount of 2.2 billion yen again, turning it into a full reserve system, or setting a limited maximum guarantee system.</p>
<p>Whether the Bank of Japan's issuance system will be like this in the future remains to be proven by facts. However, judging from its past reforms, which have all been in recognition of the facts of expansion, the future reforms will certainly be in recognition of the facts of expansion. However, past recognition of the facts of expansion has triggered future facts of expansion. Therefore, the future recognition of the facts of expansion will undoubtedly trigger even more future facts of expansion. It is likely that the fate of the German mark during the First World War will be found in a certain country in the East.</p>
<p>The Future of Japan's Trade</p>
<p>Japan's trade situation has deteriorated for a long time since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. Although attempts have been made to improve it, the aggressive ambitions have not died, resulting in unfavorable changes in the international political and commercial situation. Since the establishment of the military and economic alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan, the trade situation has become even more difficult. Fearing that the trade situation would expose the country's shortcomings, it was decided to stop publishing trade statistics. However, in recent months, the inventory of exports has increased greatly, causing difficulties in domestic capital turnover. The Minister of Finance had to declare that he had decided to change foreign trade policies, focusing his efforts on increasing trade between the yen bloc and the German-Italian axis, and no longer paying attention to trade with the US dollar and British pound blocs. The tragic nature of Japan's foreign trade is destined to be difficult to improve.</p>
<p>Originally, Japan's trade lifeline had a surplus with the British pound bloc and a deficit with the US dollar bloc. Therefore, the foreign exchange obtained from the British pound bloc was used to purchase materials from the US dollar bloc. However, it had a large trade surplus with the yen bloc. The current European war has greatly reduced Japan's export trade, making it difficult to raise funds to purchase resources from the US dollar bloc, making it difficult to obtain materials easily. Due to the deteriorating relationship with the United States, the problem of obtaining major resources has become more difficult.</p>
<p>Since forming an alliance with Germany and Italy, it has clearly stood in an adversarial position with Britain and the United States. Naturally, the trade situation has become even more unfavorable in retaliation by Britain and the United States. The United States not only reiterated the ban, but further restricted exports on October 3, requiring all military searchlights, aerial cameras, and other military equipment supplies to be subject to export registration procedures. At the same time, the Philippines is also considering imposing an embargo on Japan in order to establish export control measures similar to those of the United States, so as to intensify the US embargo on Japan. As for the British side, India first restricted the transportation of spices to Japan. From November 7, the Calcutta Customs stopped signing certificates of origin for the export of hemp and cooked hemp to Japan. Since hemp is very useful in military supplies, this move is tantamount to an embargo on raw materials for military supplies to Japan. The trade lifeline that originally depended on Britain and the United States has reached a critical moment of survival, so it has to change its foreign trade policy.</p>
<p>However, Germany and Italy are fundamentally resource-poor countries. Moreover, when they are fighting hard against Britain, what help can they give to Japan's trade? Trying to replace the position of Britain and the United States with German and Italian products is not business. As for the yen bloc, Japan's exports can only be used to maintain the value of the yen-based currency. Where can it plunder materials, and there are no foreign exchange funds to exchange for materials. Recently, Vietnam, which it controls, seems to be Japan's trade lifeline, but compared with Britain and the United States, its proportion to Japan's desired materials is clearly too small. As for the Dutch East Indies, unless military occupation is implemented, there is no way to overwhelm Britain and the United States and monopolize resources.</p>
<p>In short, Japan's trade situation was bad in the past, is difficult now, and will be tragic in the future. The Minister of Finance's change in focusing on increasing trade with the yen bloc and the German-Italian axis is not the advancement of Japan's trade. The future of Japan's trade lies in completely abandoning its aggressive ambitions. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e65">Husband and Wife Discord <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Researching all the problems concerning married life is truly complicated. In general, the union of a couple cannot escape the following three reasons: (1) union due to admiration for the other party's money, (2) union purely due to love, (3) union according to the orders of parents and the words of matchmakers. These three points are the main reasons why men and women become husband and wife. If we observe them thoroughly, the union of money cannot be as happy and rich as the union of love. Although an old and weak person can use money to win over a young girl, what he gets is not true love, but perfunctoriness, indifference, and even sleeping in the same bed with different dreams. The name of husband and wife is likely to be precarious.</p>
<p>On the contrary, if a poor couple is indeed married due to mutual love, then even if there is no rice to cook, they are willing to cry in the oxcart. Their love becomes stronger through suffering, and there are few cases of divorce. What is the reason for this? Generally speaking, the union of men and women as husband and wife is the union of sexual love. However, this sexual love cannot be bought with money. This sexual love comes from health. Healthy people can live a healthy sexual life, and as a result, they produce unparalleled joy and sweetness. From this joy and sweetness, they harvest love that is as close as glue. Therefore, my conclusion is: husband and wife discord is entirely due to the decline of sexual desire. I hope that wise couples will pay attention to this point.</p>
<p>After sexual desire declines, there will inevitably be problems such as premature ejaculation and impotence. Judging from the physiological point of view, after the comedy of spring begins, the climax of the intense feelings comes later for women than for men. If, unfortunately, a woman marries a husband with premature ejaculation and impotence, then such a marriage, obviously, can only be expected to be tragic!</p>
<p>In order to save such unfortunate men, we doctors have really put in a lot of effort. The latest treatment has been discovered for the treatment of sexual dysfunction. If patients can actively take the testicular endocrine preparation "Butikang," it can be completely cured.</p>
<p>The ingredients of "Butikang" are extracted from the testicular essence of strong animals. Because the extraction is precise, I have used this drug to treat the above symptoms, and I have never encountered a case of failure in seven years.</p>

<p>(Nephropathy and Weak Constitution)</p>
<p>Patient Yan Shouchong, 33 years old, from Guangdong. (Self-reported) – In recent years, due to business failure and excessive anxiety, his body has become weak. He not only suffers from insomnia and night sweats, but also his sexual desire has greatly decreased. (Symptoms) – He suffers from dizziness and headache upon waking up in the morning, lower back pain, pale complexion, and emaciated muscles. He can only sleep for about six hours a night at most, and often has nocturnal emission. (Treatment) – First, "Nairis nocturnal emission tablets" were used to stop nocturnal emission and treat insomnia and restlessness. After a week, nocturnal emission stopped. Then, "Butikang" was given to replenish the deficiency of the kidneys. His brain power was also particularly healthy, and his thinking greatly improved. The patient felt very happy.</p>
<p>(2) Short Genitals</p>
<p>Patient Kong Xiangyun, 19 years old, (self-reported) – He had been masturbating since the age of fifteen for three consecutive years, causing nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, and underdeveloped local development. (Symptoms) – His penis is short and completely phimotic. He has nocturnal emission two or three times a week and can also leak sperm at the sight of women. He weighs 92 pounds and has severe symptoms of neurasthenia. (Treatment) – An operation was performed to remove the phimosis. "Nairis nocturnal emission tablets" were taken before going to bed to stop nocturnal emission, and prostatic massage was performed three times a day. The testicular essence preparation "Butikang" was taken. After a month, nocturnal emission and spermatorrhea were cured and his development was healthy.</p>

<p>— Wang Kechun, German Medical Doctor</p>
<p>When a gonorrhea patient feels painful and unbearable, the terrifying situation is difficult to describe in words. Therefore, patients are threatened by the disease and indiscriminately take inferior medicines on the market, or are treated by doctors with outdated surgery and incomplete equipment. As a result, gonorrhea mostly loses the valuable opportunity to be easily cured under such erroneous treatments. This is a very regrettable thing for general gonorrhea patients in terms of treatment. Because the purpose of general over-the-counter drugs on the market is only to seek temporary effects, and their ingredients are crude and mixed with sandalwood oil and other ingredients that damage the stomach and kidneys, resulting in major side effects. As a result, although urination may be temporarily smooth, the disease soon becomes more severe, because this kind of over-the-counter drug has bad side effects such as damaging the stomach, which greatly reduces the patient's resistance; therefore, it is also very unfavorable in terms of the disease. This is the evil result of indiscriminately taking domineering inferior medicines. There is also a kind of topical symptomatic medicine, such as transdermal sterilization therapy, which can only delay the time and can never hope to achieve the purpose of radical cure.</p>
<p>When I was studying medicine in Germany, I paid attention to the treatment of gonorrhea. When I was an intern at the National University Hospital, I heard that Dr. Peter had devoted more than 30 years of effort to invent the gonorrhea-specific drug "Kelinong." Afterwards, this drug was tested in various venereal disease hospitals, proving that "Kelinong" has an anti-gonococcal effect, and its bactericidal power is not limited to the local area, but penetrates all cells. Therefore, any gonococci in every part of us, whether in the deep part or in the shallow part, can be absolutely surrounded and destroyed by taking "Kelinong."</p>
<h3 id="e68">Gonorrhea Seating Please <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic Address: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Rapid Cure for Prostatitis</p>
<p>(Treatment Verification Basis) The patient Mr. Wang Yongshu's illness initially started as anterior urethritis. With proper medical treatment, it could have been completely cured in two weeks. However, because Mr. Wang did not immediately seek effective treatment when he contracted acute gonorrhea, the gonococci spread to deeper areas. Furthermore, due to the significant irritation from alcohol consumption, the gonorrhea led the way, invading the prostate gland, causing it to swell, resulting in severe prostatitis. Such gonococcal prostatitis swelling, if not treated properly, carries the risk of ulceration and suppuration. If the prostate becomes suppurated and ulcerated, it will at least significantly affect fertility, because the prostate gland bears the important mission of secreting prostatic fluid, which is a vital source of nourishment for sperm. Fortunately, Mr. Wang came to me for treatment early, allowing the non-suppurated prostatitis swelling to be completely resolved and return to normal. The electrical prostate massage and static electricity therapy I used can directly destroy the fierce flames of gonococci. Additionally, the oral medication "Kelinong" induces an anti-gonococcal phagocytic effect inside the body, eliminating deep-seated gonococci and filtering out impure blood. With this comprehensive treatment, Mr. Wang's illness was radically cured and fertility restored in two to three weeks. However, further delay would have led to prostate suppuration, which would have been beyond salvation. Also treats syphilis, buboes, chancres, and sexual neurasthenia. Twenty consultations are given daily, with a registration fee of only five jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Common Cold Not To Be Taken Lightly <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Therefore, we must not be careless or negligent regarding the symptoms of a common cold. Treatment must be sought quickly to prevent a small spark from becoming a prairie fire. I have been practicing pulmonary medicine clinically for over thirty years. Many cases of tuberculosis that are noticed are often discovered after influenza. Whether it's the early stage of lung disease or already in the second or third stage, with symptoms such as hemoptysis, coughing, and breathing difficulties, taking "Bufei Nao'er," a medicine invented by German Dr. Tumei, is most effective. This is because "Bufei Nao'er" is formulated with valuable ingredients rich in killing tuberculosis bacteria, such as minerals and plants, and is supplemented with agents that nourish the blood and promote appetite. Taking it can search and supplement tuberculosis bacteria, increase appetite, strengthen resistance, rebuild the defenses against lung disease, and further bind the lesions, leaving no room for tuberculosis bacteria to be active, resulting in the complete elimination of all tuberculosis bacteria and the complete cure of stubborn lung disease. It is especially effective in relieving fever, eliminating phlegm, and preventing tuberculosis when taken during influenza.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Washington Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon, Carrying the Third Batch of American Evacuees, Scheduled to Set Sail for the Philippines on the Afternoon of the 20th, This Time 400 American Women and Children Depart Shanghai <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The American evacuation ship, the Washington, arrived at the Wusongkou at 12:10 pm yesterday, and at approximately 2:30 pm, it sailed to the Yangshupu surface near buoy numbers eleven and twelve to anchor. The ship's arrival in Shanghai was one hour ahead of schedule. The ship's crew also picked the ship up from the Xin Guan wharf at half past four, as originally planned.</p>
<p>Entering the Huangpu River as the First Giant Ship</p>
<p>The Washington is more than 16,000 tons larger than the previous Leposa and 7,000 tons larger than the American President Lines' President Coolidge, with a total tonnage of over 30,000 tons, making it the largest ship to enter the Huangpu River since the opening of the port of Shanghai for trade. The British merchant Changxing Company's World Class ship, the Buli Dian, is similar, but it only comes to Shanghai once a year, anchoring outside Wusongkou and not entering the Huangpu River. The ship belongs to the United States Line and operates on the Atlantic route, from New York to Genoa. The internal facilities are complete, the cabins are comfortable, and the dining rooms, lounges, dance halls, etc., are magnificent, like a sea palace, and can be called the leader of the ships that come to Shanghai.</p>
<p>More Than 400 People Made the Trip</p>
<p>According to an employee of the American President Lines who spoke to reporters, there were no passengers on board besides the crew. Although about 500 people had applied to reserve cabins on the ship, due to the cancellation of applications by people in recent days, only a little more than 400 people made the trip. The ship has spacious cabins and magnificent facilities. It is scheduled to leave Shanghai at 2:00 pm on the 20th and sail to Manila to pick up 700 American evacuees from there, then sail to San Francisco. As for whether another evacuation ship, the Manhattan, will come to the Far East, it depends on whether there is a need for it. As of now, there is no news of departure.</p>
<p>American Expatriates Quietly Await Developments in the Situation</p>
<p>It is said that there are more than 4,000 American expatriates in Shanghai. In addition to the 225 people carried away by the first evacuation ship, the Mondeli, the 85 people carried away by the second evacuation ship, and the more than 400 people this time, there are still more than 3,000 people who have not evacuated. Of these, 1,000 people are engaged in commerce or own property in Shanghai and have decided not to evacuate. There are more than 1,000 people, it is said, whose actions cannot be decided for the time being. They believe that the situation in the Far East has not yet reached the most serious stage and plan to stay here temporarily to observe its development.</p>
<p>Female Missionaries Ordered to Evacuate by a Deadline</p>
<p>American missionaries in China, after receiving the Washington State Department's notice advising them to evacuate, are currently in a dilemma. Their work in China is based on a lifelong commitment to faith, and abandoning certain charitable endeavors would run contrary to their original intentions. Therefore, most of the American missionaries in Shanghai are unwilling to evacuate. This issue is currently being studied by American authorities in China and the church. However, according to reliable information, the evacuation of female missionaries in China is imperative. The US State Department has recently formally issued a notice, setting a deadline for all female missionaries in China to evacuate within two months. According to statistics, there are approximately 400 female missionaries in China, and more than 100 in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Shanghai Municipal Council Election, Based on the Land Regulations, Absolutely No Changes Can Be Made by Any Party, the Elections Committee Only Discussed Voting Procedures, It's Impossible for the Japanese to Overwhelm British and American Influence <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The next Shanghai Municipal Council election is not until April next year, which is five months away, but because the Japanese side wanted to reverse the gentleman's agreement of the past, which consisted of five British, two American, and two Japanese councilors when this term's council election was held, and demanded to increase the number of Japanese councilors from two to five, a fierce election campaign took place this term. As a result, the next Council election has attracted the close attention of various Chinese and foreign circles in Shanghai. The reporter of the Pingming News Agency inquired with the relevant parties of the Public Concession authorities yesterday. It is reported that the Municipal Council's newly established Election Committee has held two meetings. However, the discussions were only about the procedures for the council elections, and no other issues were discussed. Even if the committee has the power to amend the rules, it may not change the Public Concession Land Regulations. This is because the British and American governments, which have significant interests in the Public Concession, will never allow any changes to be made. Therefore, in the next council election, the Japanese side may intensify their efforts and come forward to compete, given the failure of this term's election. However, the Anglo-American group still has an absolute majority advantage in owning real estate in the Public Concession. According to other reliable sources, the Japanese Residents' Association is currently preparing for the next election by purchasing real estate in the Public Concession in an attempt to increase the number of taxpayer votes. However, overwhelming the Anglo-American group is beyond the Japanese's economic ability to achieve in the near future. Therefore, there is no doubt that the Anglo-American side will still be in a winning position in the next council election. As for other foreigners, it is also advisable to maintain the current state of the Public Concession. Otherwise, they may suffer the consequences.</p>

<p>The traffic safety campaign in the two concessions is scheduled to begin today. Slogans will be posted on all vehicles to awaken citizens to pay attention to traffic safety. It is reported that since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, many people from the interior have come to Shanghai to take refuge. Most of them are not familiar with urban traffic rules. The number of incidents in the French Concession has suddenly increased, averaging 300 per month previously, increasing to 430 in December 1938. Although refugees have returned to their hometowns one after another, the number of incidents still increased to 465 in April last year. Last May, the Safety Movement Week was implemented, instilling traffic knowledge to citizens, and the number of incidents gradually decreased. This June, there were only 302 incidents. It is evident that the safety campaign has been effective. The authorities in the two concessions have recently produced sound films, planning to show them in famous theaters to instruct citizens on traffic rules. Teachers in all schools have explained traffic knowledge to the students.</p>

More than a dozen Chinese and Western detectives from the Public Concession police were standing around with guns. Vehicles and buses passing through the gaps were ordered to stop and were subjected to strict inspection. There was also barbed wire at the intersection of Foch Road and Coubert Road, where French Concession detectives were carrying out inspection work, and the atmosphere was also very tense. The reason for the sudden imposition of martial law in the above two places is unknown.</p>

<p>At about 3:30 pm the day before yesterday, Japanese Sergeant Tominaga Gong was shot by a person in front of the Japanese Residents' Association Club on Hongkou Peng Road. The bullet hit his left abdomen, and the injury was very serious. He immediately fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. Nishizaki Saburo, who was in a nearby Japanese photo studio, heard the sound and went out to see. He witnessed the shooter fleeing along Wuchang Road. Tominaga Gong was taken to Shinozaki Hospital for treatment by nearby people. A Japanese woman also said that she happened to be out shopping when she suddenly heard a bang and saw a person in his 30s, wearing a gray top, running away and heading towards Wuchang Road. As for the injured Tominaga Gong, he died yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Constant Patrols in the Blocked Area</p>
<p>After the incident, the Japanese immediately blocked the entire area. At about 8:00 pm, only one place at Waibaidu Bridge was opened. The barbed wire, like a long snake, from Jiangxi Road Bridge to Bazijie only had gaps at Haining Road (in front of the telephone company), Bazijie, and the boundary road. The remaining roads were not opened. Residents had to detour through Bazijie, North Sichuan Road, and Haining Road. Armed Japanese soldiers patrolled back and forth from time to time, and military trucks, full of Japanese soldiers, sped by constantly.</p>
<p>Wuchang Road and Other Roads Still Closed</p>
<p>As of yesterday, the Japanese still prohibited residents from entering and exiting Wuchang Road, Chongming Road, and Tiantong Road south of Wenjianshi Road. Sichuan Road Bridge was only opened at 3:30 pm yesterday. The public buses controlled by the Japanese also temporarily stopped running the day before yesterday and only resumed running yesterday, but they turned back when they reached Wenjianshi Road on North Sichuan Road and no longer drove south.</p>
<p>Passes Required for Entry and Exit in Nanshi</p>
<p>After the incident of the Japanese officer being killed on Pingyuan Road, the Japanese immediately restored the "pass" system in Nanshi. This system was only recently abolished. However, after the Japanese soldier was sniped in Hongkou the day before yesterday, the Japanese reinstated the "pass" system yesterday. Yesterday, everyone entering and exiting Nanshi was required to show the "pass," and a large number of people were blocked in and out for a while.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Shen Zaishen Memorial Ceremony, Held Yesterday at Savior's Church, Donations from All Parties for Memorial Fund <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Shen Gong Zaishen, the first Chinese bishop, devoted his life to the church and passed away a month ago at the age of 80. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday at 3:00 pm, a memorial service was held at Savior's Church on Zhao Bishop Road in the French Concession. The church was decorated with chrysanthemums and bamboo, and a portrait of the bishop was hung in front of the altar. Male and female church members gathered in large numbers, totaling more than a thousand people. Pastor Zhu Baoyuan of the church served as the master of ceremonies, leading pastors such as Yao Xianyang and Yu Enci to recite Psalms and the Bible. Bishop Luo Peide of the Anglican Church and Dr. Bu Fangji, the president of St. John's University, both participated in the service. Zhou Jinchen, the president of the association, gave a speech on the bishop's</p>
<p>life deeds, saying that the bishop lived a life of suffering. He was born during the Taiping Rebellion, and his death occurred during the national crisis. With perseverance and hard work, the bishop overcame all difficulties and established the entire Zhejiang Church. After being promoted to the first bishop on October 2, 1918, he spared no effort in promoting church affairs and established orphanages for boys and girls in Zhejiang Province, promoted public cemeteries, and established schools and other social welfare facilities. The bishop was kind by nature and</p>
<p>cared for the poor and relieved disasters</p>
<p>Therefore, he was deeply loved by the masses. His words and deeds throughout his life are too numerous to mention. He once said, "Money is like an escalator. Going up can lead to heaven, but it can also go down and fall into hell. It all depends on the person walking it." When the bishop preached, he was best able to awaken the masses with this kind of simple life concept. His contribution to the world and the human heart will last forever. Furthermore, those who attended the meeting donated to commemorate Shen Bishop's Youth Research</p>
<p>Theology Fund</p>
<p>The amount was set at 10,000 yuan, which was very enthusiastic, especially showing the depth of the bishop's morality, which is admirable. According to the Shen Gong Memorial Fund, Gaodes, Bu Fangji, Yao Xianyang, Zhu Baoyu, Ou Weiguo, etc. are the fundraising committee. At least 10,000 yuan will be raised, kept in storage, and the interest will be used to cultivate young people and study theology for the use of the church. There is no better way to continue his original intention.

<p>In order to prosper rural areas and increase the welfare of farmers, the Ministry of Finance ordered all banks to carry out agricultural loans. In order to enable farmers to obtain credit by pledging movable property, and at the same time be able to entrust custody or lease movable property for use, without hindering production and operation, and to use the funds pledged by this year's mature seedlings and livestock being raised for reproduction, and to combine the advantages of personal credit and material credit, in order to supplement the shortcomings of cooperatives and agricultural loans, the Chinese Farmers Bank has specially stipulated the Measures for Indirect Movable Property Pledges and Loans for Farmers, and issued a circular to all branch offices to implement it according to the plan. (1) The lending target is individual farmers. (2) The types of collateral are temporarily limited to the following types of movable property. If there are special items in the local area that can be pledged and are not listed in these measures, the branch office may apply to the bank for approval to add them. A. Livestock category: plows, horses, sheep, pigs (cattle and horses are limited to those of strong age); B. Agricultural implements category: waterwheels, plows, hoes, rice hullers, mills, grindstones, windmills, transportation vehicles and ships; C. Furniture category: tables, cabinets, cupboards, chairs, wooden beds; D. Ground crop category: rice, wheat, fruit, and cotton with a good harvest guarantee; E. Silk category: silkworms that have reached the stage of dormancy and have reached maturity, cocoons and silk products that have been killed, and copper and tin utensils. The above categories of materials are limited to those owned by the farmers themselves. (3) The loan period is up to one year. The maturity date should be based on the autumn harvest season and the sale of the collateral. Those who use ground crops and immature silkworms as collateral should set the repayment date within one month after the crop cocoon is harvested. (4) Loan interest rate and handling fee: The interest rate is calculated at 8% per month, plus a handling fee of 1%. Those who are responsible for introducing and guaranteeing by the cooperative can be exempted from the handling fee.</p>

<p>Critic Woodhide yesterday discussed the international current affairs of the past week in the English-language Great American Evening News. The part about the Far East said that the American election craze has passed, and from then on, it has begun to calm down. If Japan is still unaware and dreams that its triangular alliance with Germany and Italy will be enough to overthrow the US policy in the Far East, then US Secretary of the Navy Knox has given Japan a clear answer. Knox announced that the United States will provide the greatest possible assistance to the United Kingdom and hopes that it will soon assist China in the same way as it assists the United Kingdom. Knox declared that the United States will spare no expense to complete its military expansion plan, will never appease any country in the world, and will not indulge in empty words, but will focus on practical actions. Knox's declaration of the difference between democratic countries and totalitarian countries, which cannot be modified, and the inevitable war between the two sides, proves that he believes that the United States is actually in a struggle.</p>
<p>Saigon and Singapore Are Very Close</p>
<p>According to unconfirmed news, Japan has made another request to the Vietnamese government, one of which is to occupy Saigon. If this is true and can be achieved, Japan will obtain a naval base. Only 630 miles by sea from Singapore, the arrival of British Air Force General Yang Fang in Singapore last week to take up the important new post of Commander-in-Chief of British Forces in the Far East is of great significance regarding this matter.</p>

<p>Minsheng Company is the only large-scale shipping company operating on the Yangtze River route. After the war, the routes between Yichang and below, Hankou, and Shanghai were suspended due to the fall of the area and only operated on the Sichuan River routes. Now, in order to establish a machine plant and build new ships, it has submitted an application to the Ministry of Finance to issue the company's construction company bonds for 7 million yuan in national currency. It has been fully subscribed by the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Chinese Farmers Bank, and other four banks, as well as Jincheng Bank, Sichuan Provincial Bank, and others. According to the company, the funds were originally 3 million yuan, and the value of various movable properties has increased by 30,000 yuan after the war.</p>

<p>Citizens Xing Zhigang and others jointly appealed to the Refugee Relief Association yesterday to consult with the concession authorities to increase charitable funding, expand the reception of vagrants and beggars, so as to avoid starvation on the streets. The document stated, "Since the Shanghai Incident, the Refugee Relief Association has been established for many years. It is organized by the Chinese and foreign directors of the concession authorities, so it can centralize the extraction of refugee donations from various industries in Shanghai, and even extract donations from the salaries and rewards of various partners, which can be said to be the largest charitable organization in the city. However, it is feared that the refugees will be supported for a long time and will be unwilling to go out to seek a living. Perhaps there are many changes among those who still have a home to return to or are willing to return to their hometowns, and the donations from various industries are still enthusiastic. Therefore, the truly poor refugees who have no one to tell their grievances, who are displaced and starving on the streets, cannot enter the door. As soon as the severe winter comes, the corpses collected by Pushan and Fuyuan Halls increase day by day, which is the opposite of refugee relief work. What the citizens do not understand is that the Nanshi Migrant Xiqin Institute, etc., hear about raising donations outside, and often see public cars searching and loading migrants along the way, giving them education and training, so that the strong will not become thieves and disturb the neighborhoods, and the old, weak, and disabled are sent to Puyou and Yanglao Halls. The city appearance is rejuvenated. Now that your association bears the heavy responsibility of relief, you should hold the heart of treating others' hunger and drowning as your own. You should consult with the concession authorities to increase charitable funding, expand the reception of vagrants and beggars, and give them education and training, so that they will not starve on the streets. Therefore, the Shanghai concession will have no distinction between heaven and hell, and taxpayers will be willing to contribute to ensure the long-term good deeds. This is our duty. We respectfully request your association to verify and implement it. The true merit is immeasurable. "</p>

<p>The article "A Shortcut from Shanghai to Chongqing via Fujian" published in this newspaper on the 4th of this month has attracted considerable attention from all walks of life. This paper has now learned of a route from Hong Kong to Shaoguan that is more economical. After reaching Shaoguan, it is especially convenient to reach the provinces of Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Yunnan, etc. According to the transportation between Hong Kong and Shaoguan, there is one main route and two branch routes. The details of the situation along the way are described as follows:</p>
<p>First Route</p>
<p>The whole journey is 600 kilometers, and it takes about sixteen or seventeen days to reach Shaoguan. The general situation is as follows:</p>
<p>From Kowloon to Tai Po</p>
<p>Compatriots from all over who take the Dongjiang route must arrive at Kowloon Tsim Sha Tsui Station before 6:00 AM to take the through train to Tai Po, which departs at 6:20 AM. The third-class ticket costs HK$0.15. The journey takes 40 minutes.</p>
<p>From Tai Po to Sha Yu Chung</p>
<p>The distance between Tai Po and Sha Yu Chung is 30 kilometers. There are two regular ferries, Weixing and Dapeng, departing at 8:00 AM and 10:00 AM. The fare is HK$0.55, and the luggage fee is HK$0.20 per load. Wooden chairs are available for rent on the boat, costing HK$0.10. The boatman's room can be rented out for HK$1.00. The Weixing ferry has to stop briefly at Die Fu. It can arrive at Sha at noon. The Dapeng ship goes straight and arrives at 1:00 PM. At the entrance of Sha Yu Chung, the beach is shallow and there is no pier. You need to take a connecting boat to go ashore. The cost for people and luggage is about one yuan. The Chinese customs has a branch office here to inspect incoming and outgoing passengers, goods, and luggage. Office hours start at 2:00 PM. Those with student identity certificates can get considerable convenience when inspecting luggage. On the beach, the police chief of the Provincial Police Headquarters assists returning overseas Chinese in hiring porters to transport luggage. From Sha to Dan, the regulation is that each load must not exceed ten yuan in national currency (including the porter's food and accommodation). The porters all have registration certificates. Passengers can first retain the certificate to avoid the trouble of following closely along the way. If you want to hire a sedan chair, it costs 25 yuan in national currency, but you cannot carry luggage.</p>
<p>From Sha Yu Chung to Kwai Chung</p>
<p>The distance between Sha and Kwai is ten kilometers. It takes four hours to walk. The plank road along the way is rugged and it takes a lot of effort to walk. Stay here overnight. There are better equipped hotels such as the Republic, Fort, New Era, and Ban'an. The room rate is about two yuan in national currency per night, plus tips. The restaurants, Kwai Hua, Hua Nan, and Xiao Tang, are clean. An ordinary person can fill their stomach for one yuan. Luggage must be sent to the hotel by a porter, otherwise there is a risk of theft.</p>
<p>From Kwai Chung to Danshui</p>
<p>The next day, around 5:00 AM, continue the journey to Danshui. The whole journey is more than 60 li and can be reached in seven or eight hours. The section from Kwai Chung to Qiankeng in Danshui is narrow, dangerous, and uneven. You have to step in mud and water along the way, so it is better to wear canvas shoes and straw sandals. The Qiankeng-Danshui section is relatively flat and bicycles are available for rent. The bicycle rental fee is about seven or eight yuan. It is more comfortable to ride than to walk. (Note: Qiankeng is a small market town. The cost of living can be said to be the highest in the whole journey. A bowl of white rice costs 3 jiao, pork costs 3.7 yuan per catty, and vegetables cost 6 jiao per catty. The place is a bit unclean, so travelers mostly do not stay here.) In the afternoon, arrive at Danshui. The Provincial Police Headquarters has an office at the South Gate, headed by Lian Xiulin of the training brigade, who is responsible for coordinating porters, boats, vehicles, wages, and freight. Merchants can request assistance. There are many hotels in the city, including Yixinlou, Shuxiang, Huaqiao, Ping'an, and Guangdong. Yixinlou is the best. After the provincial government rectified it, a single room that can accommodate two people costs only 2.2 yuan in national currency. There are restaurants such as Zhenhe.</p>
<p>From Danshui to Laolong</p>
<p>(1) The distance between Danshui and Laolong is 540 li. Waterways are accessible. It costs 35 to 40 yuan per person including luggage. It is better to charter a boat if you can gather a dozen people. It usually costs 400 yuan. The boat trip takes 10 to 13 days, depending on the weather and wind direction. Along the way, it passes through Yonghu, Huizhou, Shuikou, Hengli, Shatan, Paiwei, Guanyinge, Guzhu, Heyuan, Xiantang, Xiangxi, Huangtian, Lankou, Liucheng Longchuan and other places. If there are not many travelers, you can wait for a train in Longchuan to go to Shao. There are hotels in Longchuan City such as Lidong, Huanghua, Longchuan, Dongjiang, and Leijiang, which are closer to the train station. There are restaurants such as Fengping and Jingji. If you stay for a day, it costs 9 yuan per person. You can cook on the boat, and the boatwoman can also help. You need to buy rice along the way. The lowest cost for each person for the whole journey is about 27 yuan. (2) There are electric boats between Danlong, which travel at night and stop during the day. The time is not as economical as folk boats, and the price is quite extravagant. They do not allow much luggage, so it can be said that it is not worth it.</p>
<p>From Longchuan to Shaoguan</p>
<p>(1) The distance between Long and Shao is 227 kilometers. There are military transport vehicles, highway bureau buses, and commercial vehicles. The bus ticket costs 27.5 yuan. Few travelers can buy tickets because there are too few vehicles. There is only one bus per day. There are about dozens of trucks every day, and sometimes less than ten, carrying passengers has become an open secret. It costs 45 to 55 yuan per person including luggage. It can be reached in two days. (2) Vehicles can be arranged by the hotel clerks. They depart early every morning. You can have breakfast at Dengta. Passing through Shuntian, Zhongxin, Qimu Ao, Cumu Zhang, Lianping, and Pitou to Longxian, you can stay at the Tairan Hotel in Xinjie, which is quite affordable. Continue the next morning, passing through Sanhua Yan Ferry to Wengyuan, where you can have breakfast. Then, passing through Xinkou and Dakeng, arrive at Maba, only 21 li from Qujiang, to rest. The vehicle will then drive to Shaoguan at about 1:00 PM (because of Qujiang dredging time). The car arrives in Shao at about 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>Points to Note</p>
<p>(1) The military and police inspections along the way are strict. Identity certificates must be carried with you. (2) The total travel cost for this route is 100 yuan in national currency. If you need to take a sedan chair or your luggage exceeds 60 or 70 catties, it will cost more. (3) It takes a lot of effort to buy food along the way. You should prepare more dry food. (4) The political situation in Guangdong Province is quite on track and public security is not a problem. Bombing incidents are rarely heard. (5) You can bring more luggage, but no more than two pieces. The freight is not expensive and it is not difficult to communicate with the driver.</p>
<p>Second Route</p>
<p>The whole journey is 415 kilometers and it takes about sixteen or seventeen days to reach Shao.</p>
<p>1. Kowloon to Paiwei: From Kowloon to Paiwei, the same as the first route.</p>
<p>2. Paiwei to Banling: From Paiwei via Xiancun to Pingling, stay overnight at Shanggongzhuang. It is about 85 li. You can hire a boat for about 8 yuan in national currency per person.</p>
<p>3. Pingling to Shaoguan: From Pingling to Shaoguan, you have to cross two major mountain ranges, passing through Longmen, Lanyu, Xinfeng, Ganzhu, Huilong, Qingtang, Wengyuan, Dakengkou and other places. This section is 540 li long and can be reached in nine days on foot.</p>
<p>Points to Note</p>
<p>(1) The total cost is 120 yuan in national currency, which is more economical than the first route. (2) Public security is worrying. Robberies occur from time to time. It is not easy to hire porters. There are only a few accommodation stations. You need to contact the local township offices, which is quite inconvenient for travelers.</p>
<p>Third Route</p>
<p>The whole journey is 100 kilometers shorter than the first route, which can save about 40 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>1. Kowloon to Heyuan: From Kowloon to Heyuan, the whole section is the same as the first route.</p>
<p>2. Heyuan to Dengta: In Shan Heyuan, the Provincial Government's Overseas Chinese Affairs Office can hire porters to carry luggage to Dengta to wait for a bus to Shao. Each group costs 15 or 16 yuan and can be reached in one day.</p>
<p>3. Dengta to Shaoguan: Take a highway bus. Public security is not a problem and it is not difficult to hire porters. However, it is not easy to wait for a bus in Dengta, so it is better to go around Laolong Longchuan.</p>

<h3 id="e87">For the Sake of Contesting the Management of the Store's Assets, Widow and Younger Uncle Sue Each Other: Officials Diligently Conciliate in Court <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Tang Xue, a woman from Suzhou, is 38 years old this year and currently lives at 635 Niuzhuang Road, Public Concession. On December 16, 1937, she married Tang Dexin, the owner of Yongxing Bingji at Niuzhuang Road, with Xue Shoufu and Zai Enji as matchmakers. The couple's relationship was very close. Unexpectedly, the beautiful scenery did not last long. Tang suddenly</p>
<p>Died of illness this spring.</p>
<p>Tang's younger brother Youguang was entrusted to manage the affairs in the store. Recently, Tang Xue believed that her late husband's younger brother You was attempting to seize the store's assets, so she hired lawyer Lin Yingqing to file a complaint with the First Special Court's Civil Court, requesting that the defendant Tang Youguang be ordered to hand over the store's assets and all account books. The case has been heard by Judge Xu and adjourned to be heard again after summoning witnesses. At the same time, Tang Youguang also hired a lawyer to file another case against Tang Xue, requesting</p>
<p>Order to hand over the accounts</p>
<p>And requested that Tang Xue was the concubine of his late brother Tang Bingxin and has no right to inherit the estate. The court accepted the case and yesterday Judge Ni and Clerk Ding of the Civil Court No. 3 summoned the two parties, each accompanied by their lawyers. First, the plaintiff Tang Youguang stated that the defendant Tang Xue was not his brother Tang Bingxin's official wife, but a temporary couple, and could not inherit his</p>
<p>Brother's estate</p>
<p>Therefore, he requested that the defendant be ordered to hand over the account books and not occupy Yongxing Bingji. The defendant Tang Xue, accompanied by lawyer Lin Yingqing, insisted before the court that she was a formal couple with the deceased Tang Bingxin and that the matchmakers were all present. She requested that the judge inquire and then he would understand. The plaintiff Tang Youguang attempted to seize the store assets left by the defendant's husband, and made up a story to deceive the court. She requested that the plaintiff's claim be dismissed. The court reviewed the words and spoke to both parties</p>
<p>Kindly for a long time</p>
<p>Hoping that the two parties would reconcile. After the two parties were persuaded by the court, they also had the intention to reconcile. The court then ordered that the case be adjourned to November 21 for another hearing. During the adjournment, it was hoped that the lawyers representing the two parties would do their best to persuade the parties to make concessions to each other and reconcile. After the discussion, the court adjourned.</p>

<p>At 2:50 PM on the 14th, seven robbers suddenly came to Yonghua Paint Factory at 339 Lipu Road, Xuhui. They took out pistols and intimidated the accountant and other staff to remain silent. They robbed a French gold ring and clothes worth a total of 1,375 yuan and fled. Later, the victim Zhang Jiuxiang reported to the Gordon Road Police Station. Chinese Detective Wang Chengying and detective Xie Zhiguang arrested four local robbers, Sheng Axiao, Wang Fubao, Zhang Peigen from Wuxi, and Wang Genbao from Changzhou, in room 215 of the Far East Hotel on Yuqiaqing Road at about 10:00 AM the day before yesterday. They found stolen foreign currency of 338.5 yuan and several pawn tickets. One gold ring had been exchanged for 74.8 yuan at Qiu Quanbao Jewelry Store on Nanjing Road. Yesterday, the police station escorted the four thieves Sheng Axiao and others to the First Special Court. Police station lawyer Zhang Tianyin said that the group was arrested for arguing about the uneven distribution of the loot in the hotel at the time. He asked for an extension of the case. Judge Huang Risheng questioned the four defendants and ordered them to be detained and reviewed again at a later date.</p>

<p>Guo Hongkai from Yangzhou, over fifty years old, a vendor, lived at 172 Kenning Road. Years ago, he took in Huang Lu, a young woman from the same hometown (26 years old), as his concubine. At first, the old man and young woman were deeply affectionate and looked like a married couple. Recently, due to Guo's financial difficulties, quarrels often occurred in the family. Xu Guobao (46 years old), a friend from the same hometown, who also set up a fried dough stall nearby, was often in Guo's house. Over time, he had an affair with Huang. At first, they had a secret affair, but later they became blatant. Recently, Huang lingered at Xu's stall, assisting with everything, and did not return home at night. When Guo sometimes forced her to go back, she often refused and ridiculed him instead. Guo negotiated with Xu, but it was ineffective. In a fit of jealousy, he conceived a murder plan. At about 9:05 AM yesterday, he went out and bought a sharp axe and went to Xu's stall at the corner of Kenning Road and Avenue Edward VII. Without saying a word, he took out the sharp axe and chopped Xu's head seven times. Xu was caught off guard and was injured on the spot, fainting. Later, someone called the police and the murderer Guo Hongkai was arrested and taken to the Hongkou Police Station. The injured person was rushed to the Red Cross Hospital on Xizang Road, but the treatment was ineffective and he died soon after. The body was later sent to the morgue for examination.</p>

Chinese Detective Wang Zhenfei learned about it and rushed to the tea garden, arrested him, and found the opium. He was taken to the Yangshupu Police Station together. Yesterday, he was escorted to the First Special Court. Police Station lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the case, and as a result, Shi was sentenced to six months in prison and the opium was confiscated.</p>

<p>Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation: Special Issue on Safety Movement</p>
<h3 id="e99">Safety First <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>There is an idiom in the West called "Safety First." The meaning of Satty First is that no matter what we do, we always take safety as the first priority. Rash actions and reckless charging are absolutely unacceptable.</p>
<p>In the four major items of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, "Safety First" can be used as a motto for any item, especially for "transportation," which requires the most attention. On the Shanghai roads with heavy traffic, you must always keep the four characters "Safety First" in mind.</p>
<p>In view of the sharp increase in traffic accidents, the concession authorities have posted slogans everywhere, such as "The road is like a tiger's mouth, don't walk in the middle," to warn the general public. Last year, they also promoted a week-long safety movement to do practical work, and the results were remarkable. The number of accidents has decreased a lot in the past year. Therefore, starting from the 18th of this autumn, it has been decided to do it again. All citizens should support it from the sidelines, promote it with all their strength, and explain it to women and children in a practical way so that they understand the great significance of this safety movement, so that under the rolling wheels, I hope everyone will not forget the four-character mantra "Safety First!" in every step.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Safety Significance <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>

<h3 id="e101">Various Aspects of Safety <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Speech Manuscript from Yaojiaxian Elementary School</p>
<p>Streets: The construction of streets (roads) is for the use of various vehicles. However, pedestrians (walkers) may cross from one side of the road to the other when necessary.</p>
<p>Sidewalks: Sidewalks (curbs) are designed specifically for pedestrians and are therefore higher than the street to protect those walking on them.</p>
<p>Vehicles: All vehicles must travel on the left half of the street. Faster vehicles (such as cars) should be near the center of that half of the street, while slower vehicles (such as rickshaws) should be close to the sidewalk.</p>
<p>Pedestrians on the Sidewalk: Pedestrians should walk on the sidewalk, preferably on the right side of the sidewalk. This way, you can clearly see vehicles approaching from the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Things to Remember: (1) Never run or race on the sidewalk, or chase after playmates, to save time. Time is valuable, but life is even more valuable! (2) Never dash out from alleyways onto the sidewalk or into opposite alleyways without looking. (3) Never play with toys, perform comedies, ride bicycles, or skate on the sidewalk. (4) Do not walk on the sidewalk with your head down in deep thought or reading novels, books, or newspapers.</p>
<p>Things Pedestrians Should Pay Special Attention to on the Street: (1) When it is necessary to cross the street, look right first, then left. (2) If the street is painted with yellow lines and there are signs on the sidewalk that say "Cross Here," be sure to use them every time. First look right; if no vehicles are approaching, walk within the yellow lines to the middle. If there is a platform, pause briefly, then look left before walking within the yellow lines to the opposite sidewalk. (3) Pay attention to and obey the hand signals of traffic officers or the signals of traffic lights. If you see a red light, stop immediately. You can proceed only when you see a green light. However, if you see a yellow light flashing simultaneously with a red or green light, you must stop if you have not yet reached the intersection or crossed the white line on the road.</p>
<p>Things You Should Not Do: (1) Do not leave the sidewalk and walk onto the street without looking left and right clearly. (2) Do not stand on the street, or wander around and linger on the street, or zigzag through vehicles. (3) Do not chase toys or playmates on the street, or run from schools, shops, or homes into the street. (4) Do not skate or play similar games on the street. (5) Do not cling to any vehicles. (6) Do not cross the street in front of or behind stopped vehicles without looking carefully. (7) Do not get on or off buses, trams, or rickshaws recklessly without paying attention.</p>
<p>Cyclists on the Street: Many children use bicycles to travel to school, exercise, and play. Therefore, the following warnings are attached for guidance: (1) Do not suddenly turn without using hand signals, or speed around corners to the right and make sharp turns, as this can easily cause accidents. (2) Do not overtake vehicles suddenly, as you may lose balance and fall. (3) Do not ride side-by-side with other vehicles. Riding three or four abreast is extremely dangerous. (4) Avoid tram tracks and slippery areas to prevent slipping and falling. (5) Do not overtake vehicles from the left, as the vehicle in front may pull over and stop, easily causing an accident. (6) Do not cling to trams, cars, or rickshaws, as you can easily fall when you let go. (7) Do not attempt fancy riding tricks, such as taking both hands off the handlebars or placing both feet on one side, to avoid losing your footing. (8) Always pay attention to and obey the hand signals of traffic officers or the signals of traffic lights. If you see a red light, stop immediately. You can proceed only when you see a green light. If you see a yellow light flashing simultaneously with a red or green light, you must stop if you have not yet reached the intersection or crossed the white line on the road. Accidents involving children due to violations of traffic regulations are often heard of, all because of a lack of traffic knowledge. You must always remember all of the above to avoid danger, ensure safety, and help others imperceptibly.</p>
<p>Please guide younger children and classmates. When walking together, discuss compliance with rules, explain the importance of personal safety, and assist them when necessary to ensure safety together. This is of utmost importance.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Sunday — One of Shanghai's Reliefs <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Zuo Hui</p>
<p>As usual, the arrival of Sunday brings people together in groups. Well, here come three; that's the minimum number because three guests plus one host make exactly one table!</p>
<p>The guests say, "We're here to bother you again."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about? After working all week, you should enjoy yourselves today." This is true. The host is quite interested in mahjong; the guests are the same. Otherwise, they wouldn't have come with a ready-made "partner" for fear of disturbing others.</p>
<p>The hostess is very attentive, pouring tea, offering cigarettes, and chatting and laughing. She is well-acquainted with the guests. She playfully says, "Are you going to play mahjong? Then things need to be quick. You've been pacing around the room, looking restless." Although the hostess herself doesn't play, she enjoys directing her husband from behind, suggesting "Play the Xth card from the side" or "Eat, eat! Eat his card!" But the biggest reason is that if they lose, it's her husband's money, and if they win, her "dry share" of the profits is significant.</p>
<p>One of the guests doesn't hide it and says, echoing the hostess, "Yes, if we're playing mahjong, let's hurry."</p>
<p>However, three children are doing their homework at the only table available! Three small children in the third or fourth grade are working on division problems. One older child is occupying half the table with ink, graph paper, rulers, and drawing instruments scattered haphazardly. The children are focused, though they glanced up when the guests entered. They continue to pour their energy into their work. To make the children who are working hard leave so they can play mahjong, the guests are, of course, a little embarrassed to do that. One of them cleverly says to the host, "Mr. Mo, will you play, or will your wife play?"</p>
<p>So, the host says, "I'll play, I'll play." He orders his wife to find the mahjong tiles and tells the two younger children, "You can do your homework tonight."</p>
<p>The younger children don't understand much anyway. The main reason they study is because they are afraid of their father's stern face and loud scolding. Now that their father is asking them not to study, they naturally "obey orders" as if they've been granted a pardon. They pack up their books and rummage through the drawer for two spinning tops, then dash outside.</p>
<p>The three guests, Mom and Dad, stand around the older child. Since his two younger siblings have already run out, he is, of course, embarrassed to continue his homework. He slowly packs up his stationery.</p>
<p>"Oh, so diligent. You should go out and play on Sunday!" one of the guests says to comfort him, talking to himself. "Just like a young lady, always staying indoors."</p>
<p>"She'll definitely pass the imperial exam as the top female scholar in the future!" another guest chimes in.</p>
<p>The older child finally walks away silently with his head down. Immediately, there is a "clatter" as the mahjong tiles jump onto the table.</p>
<p>Hawthorne's Detective Cases</p>
<h3 id="e103">The Whereabouts of the Dancing Queen <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 11: Zhao Boxiong's Confession</p>
<p>His apology naturally refers to the bullet in the telephone booth. His manner of speaking is quite sincere. Hawthorne seems to understand his sincerity and nods.</p>
<p>He says, "You thought you could warn me in this way and tell me not to interfere in this matter. I must say you miscalculated, and it also shows that you disregard my history. However, I also admit that you only wanted to warn me and had no malicious intent at the time."</p>
<p>The fake old man suddenly jumps up from the sofa and says loudly, "Mr. Hawthorne, have you forgiven me? Your intelligence and insight are truly admirable. Really, I had no malicious intent. I aimed the gun, passing over your height, and you even understood that. Mr. Hawthorne—"</p>
<p>Hawthorne slowly interjects, "Yes, I saw the bullet hole in the wooden wall, half an inch above my height. But if you had wanted to hit me at that time, your agility of movement seemed a bit lacking."</p>
<p>Listening to these two people talking sharply to each other fills me with an indescribable excitement. This Zhao Boxiong is truly a formidable character. But a somersault of Sun Wukong cannot escape the palm of Sakyamuni!</p>
<p>Hawthorne continues, "Mr. Zhao, please sit down. Please tell me again about Li Zhifan on Datong Road."</p>
<p>Zhao Boxiong composes himself, sits down, calms his mind, and then answers. "This matter has nothing to do with me. The fact is very simple. After some thought, I felt that Li Zhifan might be the one who killed Wang Lilan. Because when I was tracking the person in the raincoat leaving number twenty-seven, only Lilan and that old man were in his reception room. When I returned to his door in disappointment, there was nothing unusual inside or outside the house. The time elapsed was no more than ten minutes, and Lilan died during this time. So, besides Li Zhifan, there is indeed no second suspicious person. This afternoon, I received news of the autopsy at the police station and learned that Lilan died from a knife wound, and my bullet happened to hit the same wound. Now that my theory has been proven, I wanted to see Li Zhifan and ask him why he killed Lilan. (169)"</p>
<h3 id="e104">Seven Reasons for Car Accidents <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>In every large metropolis in the world, various car accidents occur every day, and the situation in Shanghai is certainly no different. The Street Traffic Committee of Harvard University in the United States, in order to study this issue, specially appointed several experts and spent several years. Their conclusion is that most accidents are due to drivers committing seven types of errors. These are translated below for reference by all sectors in order to avoid them as much as possible.</p>
<p>(1) Failure to use the brakes appropriately, especially braking too slowly, is a cause of accidents.</p>
<p>(2) Immature driving skills.</p>
<p>(3) Failure to estimate the speed of other vehicles moving in the same direction.</p>
<p>(4) The driver has vision problems.</p>
<p>(5) Lack of judgment.</p>
<p>(6) Helplessness in emergencies, without a calm attitude.</p>
<p>(7) Vision is abnormally affected by the glare of headlights from oncoming vehicles.</p>
<p>Explanation of "Standard of Living"</p>
<p>We often hear people discussing the recent situation in Shanghai, always saying: The current "standard of living" in Shanghai is really too high. In fact, this statement is wrong, or they do not thoroughly understand this specialized term.</p>
<p>So, what is called the "standard of living"? In short, the ratio of living income to living expenses. If prices are low and living income is high, this is called a high "standard of living." However, in my current situation, the multiple by which prices have risen is vastly different from living income, which happens to be a low "standard of living," while what is high is living expenses. Therefore, we should call it high living expenses and not a high "standard of living."</p>
<h3 id="e105">Exam Questions from the Previous Class B Postal Worker Exam <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
