<p>美國副國務卿威爾斯氏奉命歷聘歐洲諸强·先後與義德法英四國當局相把晤；更取道義京羅馬，小作勾留·倚裝以侍義國首相墨索里尼氏與德國元首希特勒氏傾談歸來，然後再與義國外相齊亞諾氏作長談，始首途返美。昨夜電訉，威氏已於昨日安抵紐約，即赴華盛頓。據前昨所傳，美國總統羅斯福氏或國務卿赫爾氏，將於聆取威爾斯氏報吿之後，有所宣示於宇內。威氏使命之實際範疇，聘問之確切收穫，既因各方負責者之緘口如瓶，局外人無自而窺知其底蘊；則美國總統或國務卿所欲據以宣示者，自非任何人所得逆覩其涯涘；雖然，三五日內舉世所引頸企踵以待者，實在於此。誠不知羅斯福氏或赫爾氏將何以吿慰世人？</p>
<p>自威爾斯氏之聘問歐洲諸强，以迄其返國報命之期間·國際現象紊雜，可作種種見解；若僅皮相一二現象，自難獲致準確之斷案。例如旬日來之各交戰國家，在在表示其赴戰之決心，多方積極，不稍懈忽，更於國際之政治外交經濟諸方面，尤表示雙方鬥爭之尖銳；同時，芬蘇戰局既急轉直下以媾和，歐陸交戰國在軍事方面復似有所期待而無酷烈之行動，嶄新之動態；是就大體言，憂喜參半而不能軒輊於其間。緣此窺測威氏此行之成敗，誠有難言矣。吾人熱望威氏有異常收穫，羅斯福氏以决，乃　倒挽在瀾，化干戈為玉帛；使世界三組戰爭，芬蘇爆發最後而解決最先，英法德國交戰先於芬蘇而解決則繼芬蘇之後，然後共謀安定遠柬之道。美國最偉大之貢獻，解紛最合理之程序，宜莫逾於此。容或不然，美國以威爾斯氏此行而灼知歐戰雙方之意態懸殊，形格勢禁，排解之時機猶未成熟、則吾人所熱望於美總統或國務卿之所以宣示宇內者，要在闡明歐戰之癥結，並將兩週前美總統對於國際和平所作之詮釋·即眞實·持久，穩固，正直而合理之和平，乃人羣普遍之需求，顧必以道義為之基礎；秉此詮釋，衡量歐戰雙方之意態。藉以解答人羣普遍之疑問曰：英法德交戰，其於和平之需要與否，意態根本相乖乎？雙方共認和半應作正當之詮釋乎？豈交戰國雙方中之一方，乃竟蓄意控制對方亡對方乎：此數問者，吾人深信文明之族類必作類似之答復；而歐洲戰爭之性質，與遠東戰爭之性質，逈小相侔者亦在於此。美國根據威爾斯氏之報吿，倘若證實如此解答之不謬，則排解歐局之時機雖未成熟，然排解之可能性固必歷久而始終存在者也。吾熱望威氏不虛此行，歐局得以美國當局之根據威氏報告而從事於排解，緣是而亦見急轉直下；容或不然，實行排解雖待機運之來臨，然如何促使雙方漸决短縮其意態懸殊之距離，亦美國所義不容辭而為美國當局所樂於努力者乎？</p>
<p>美國遠處新大陸，卓立於近頃戰爭漩渦之外。徒以國際政治外交經濟之利害錯綜，痛癢相關，事實不容美國之閉關而孤立：是以曩日世界三　戰爭並存之日，美國所分頭致力者三事。及今芬蘇戰爭既了，歐陸排解時機之已未成熟亦將由威爾斯氏之復命而判明；謂已成熟，則美國當然不稍寬縱而必亟謀所至善；謂未成熟，則美國努力為歐陸排解作準備者一事，更以有效之行動應付遠東者為又一事。誠以遠東戰爭之性質，不同於歐陸；歐陸所需者排解，遠東所需者制暴戢亂；排解須待交戰國雙力樂於接受，制暴戢亂無須暴亂者之同意；須待接受者有機運成熟與否之分，無須同意者目審力量與功效何似而已。力量之在軍事方面者，美國必自知為雄厚無倫之生力軍，而海空軍不日在太平洋之大演習，將由測騐而證明雄厚之確實；抑以美國制暴戢亂，無須軍力，但須決心；况對付筋疲力竭之餘，事類摧枯拉朽。力量之在經濟方面者，禁運便是有效之制裁，證以美日商約失效後日本所表示之憂惶，蓋彼自露骨說明之矣。</p>

<p>官人</p>
<p>古今官人之法不同，古今官人之途亦各異，上自唐虞，下及有明，前後而綜計之，可以知其詳矣。夫聖主在上，其官人也，與眾共之；中主在上，其官人也，一己專之；庸主在上，其官人也，人自謀之；迨至上將自謀，而國必至不可言矣。何以言與眾共之也，試觀堯之官舜，舜之官禹，初則盡咨於四岳，繼因四岳之咸薦，終方置之於廟堂，厥後夏商周官人，亦皆如此，　帝三王之治，所以高出萬世者，未必非能官人之效也。何以言一己專之也，兩漢之制，不師帝王，僅師嬴秦，君則日尊，臣則日卑，其行政也，動則曰乾網獨攬，其官人也，動則曰因自上出，大有不屑君臣同類之意。其中亦間有如漢武帝之官汲長孺，唐太宗之官魏文貞，雖常犯　直諫，面折其過，漢武猶能容之，非冠帶不見其人，至太宗不過沽名釣譽，常受文貞直言，含忍回宮，則曰：「吾必殺此田舍翁，方洩吾恨。」若非文貞公忠，長孫王后勸諫，恐難保始終如一矣。其於他人，喜則陟之，怒則黜之，非為國家用賢，實為一己市惠也。然武帝猶能託孤於霍光，以輔昭帝；而太宗反授遺命於高寒不，以貴李　，其優劣不待言而知矣。兩帝向稱漢唐賢主，尚且如此，何况更不如兩帝者，其官人更可悉矣。</p>

<h3 id="c120">兩個騙局 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>上海五方雜處，良莠不齊，更其在生活程度這樣高漲的現在，各種騙局黑幕幾乎每天在搬演着，祇要略一疏忽，往往上當不淺。不過事後查察，每一個騙局的發生，都有他們「有機可乘」的原因在內。如下面的兩篇來稿，一是借着修水管爲名，偷去了一具無綫電。那騙子當然事先知道這裏有喜事，而且上海住戶都是「各人自掃門前雪」，這就使他有機會下手了。第二是貧便宜，種牛痙，不是有着免費的工部局牛痘施種處嗎，大家偏偏會信任一個素不相識」的上門（特派員，於是在一派胡言之下，騙去了十五塊錢。所以同居應該相互帮助，照應，如果大家不關事，讓一個修水管的人在屋子裏上不奔走，即使眞是大房東派來的，恐怕也會發生「順手牽羊」的事（報紙上有過這樣的事實）。而一個「素不相識」的人來談什麼「完全義務一概免費」，更其是應該注意才是。（編者）</p>
<h3 id="c121">醫院「特派員」 <a href="#c121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— 瑾</p>
<p>前天傍晚回家，剛跨上樓梯時，已聽見一片怨恨聲，一遇見T姊時，她失望地告訴我：「倒霉！騙去了十五塊錢啦」。的確！我門家裏遇騙還算是第一次。</p>
<p>事實是如此：就在那天不午三點鐘左右，T姊拿了十五塊錢預備去買東西，正跑到樓下，來了一個素不相識的身穿舊西服大衣年約三旬的中年男子，本地口音，手裏提着皮包，闖進二房東家裏，說：『我是××醫院的特派員，我們醫院全是救濟性質，明晨九點鐘在甘世東路口（距我家很近）義務施種牛痘，你們準定都要去種呀！但患有濕氣的人郤不行。』於是就坐了下來，又謂：「如果你們遇見有病的貧民，請他們來院診治，『分文不取』。」說畢，留下一張紙條：「大世界對面××醫院問十二號趙子坤」。又說：他會診病呢，「完全義務一概免費」。不過你們經我治愈的人，要送一幅匾給我。替我揚揚名氣；在醫院方面，可以加我十塊錢薪水。這樣的確不會使人注意到也是騙子。</p>
<p>於是二房東首先請他看了。看到第五個人，就是T姊的兒子，今年才六歲，患有皮膚病。他就對T姊說：『這小孩子在濕氣未除前，身體是不會健康的，經我治，我保可發胖。現在就先診騐一下然後下藥。可是，你住在那裏，因爲要脫去衣服，在這兒小孩子受冷呀！』T姊老實的吿：『就在樓上。』『那最好沒有，我們就到樓上去看罷　』於是大家到了樓上　T姊把她兒子的外衣脫去，由T姊抱着，這時樓上沒有其他的人。他從他帶來的皮包裏，拿出一個直徑寸餘的銅圓筒，三寸來長，放在小孩子的肚臍上。圓筒的上面，連着的三尺長的橡皮管，像抽氣筒樣的吸着。『這裏面是有電流的呀』！還有這種胡話。片刻之後，把銅筒放下，只見裏面是些鼻涕般的流汁，說是從身體內吸出來的，所以肚臍上要立刻敷藥，這種藥每瓶售價三四元！共約十五元左右。在買來之後還要加醋在一起煎的，他並向T姊：『你識字嗎』？『識』。『英文呢』？『那可不懂』。『那麼我給你</p>

<p>— 文英</p>
<p>今天是什麼日子？烈士節紀念日。二十九年前的今天，先烈們以犧牲的精神，爲爭取自由的代價，造成這一頁光榮的歷史——要推翻滿淸，使人民從暴政下得辦放。</p>
<p>可是現在呢？黑暗不知超過了當時幾千萬倍，壓迫，侮辱，殺戮，都加重在每一個身處此時此地的同胞之上，身心失去了自由，一切失去了保障，嚴重地的威脅正四週環迫，這黑暗，使我們到了無可耐受的地步，所以今天，我們除了虔誠的紀念外，還要繼續先烈的精神，發揮大家的力量，看着當前的環境，想想做些什麼事情？</p>
<p>要是我們不能繼續先烈的犧牲精神，爲國家爲民族而奮鬬，祇能作一種儀式的紀念，這是後死者的恥辱！</p>
<p>寫個英文藥名罷！』說着就把T姊手裏一個預去買東西約十五塊錢的紙包接了過去，在祇包上面書了幾個英文字，再從皮包內抽出一張膏藥，對T姊說：『你把我剛才敎你加酷煎藥的方法，念一遍給我聽。』在她照樣背誦之後，他說：不對，從前有一個人把我的方法弄錯了，結果買來十多塊錢的西藥都弄糟了。並且，現在藥房裏都把存貨賣給顧每，藥力不足，價錢又責，我恐怕你們把藥弄糟，豈不可惜，所以願意將已配好煎過的藥，作八折出售罷。接着從皮包裏拿出兩一瓶曰藥粉，倒在他那張膏藥上，說也奇怪，那個錢包也不知那裏去了。他把膏藥貼在小　子的肚臍上，說：『你們好好地照應他，廿四小時就可好，我下星期』再來。』說罷收拾他帶來的東西匆匆地走了。</p>

<p>— 光照</p>
<p>本月三日，天下着牛毛雨是一個同居結婚的日子。在十時左右，來了一個穿籃布工衣的小夥子，手裏拿着鐵鉗子和一切修水管所應用的零件，他進門時就說，大房東叫我來修水管的。灶間裏娘姨一聽不錯，馬桶間裏水管不十分靈活，就着他上樓來了。樓上人以爲大房東派來的，也不注意他。上樓以後，他上上下下走了十多遍，人家以爲他看水管，其實他察看每個房間裏的東西，到了十二點鐘的時候，他對娘姨說：下半天再來修。二點鐘左右，他果然又來了，那時結婚的時間到了，許多人都去滲觀婚禮，一幢房子裏祇有一個娘姨看家，那個修水管的仍和上午那樣上上下下的走，他忽然對娘姨說：這個水管修不好，爲了你們樓上的那座收音機，其實收音機和水管是兩不相關的，因爲娘姨的不明白，竟使他有偷取收音機的機會，他直接對娘姨說，讓我把收音機拿下去配一配，那末水管就可以修好了。無知的娘姨信已爲眞，眼看着他把收音機拿下去，等了半個多鐘點不上來，娘姨也發急了，下去去查，那裏去查呢，聰明的賊子也許早已把東西變買了。</p>

<p>— 勛</p>
<p>近幾天來，市上到了許多大蘋菓與黑棗，小販們都是盈筐滿籃在馬路旁叫喊喚賣。</p>
<p>蘋菓一角兩隻，黑棗五分一包，每斤二角。這種價格，在上海市上的確是便宜極了，不過請大家不要受這種便宜的誘惑，也不要受他們的謊言欺騙，蘋菓並不是印度的而是朝鮮的，黑棗並不是福建的而是台灣的，大家要認識淸楚。</p>

<h3 id="c126">十字架上的一句話 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>我們相信耶穌在十字架上所說的話，被保留到如今。當時在塲的人有約翰，他是有濃厚愛心和敏慧耳朶的人。有三位馬利亞，即耶穌的母親，基伯斯的妻子，和馮大啦的馬利亞。她們愛耶穌，當然十分注意耶穌的事。還有別的許多婦女，同時自然也有別的門徒在那裏。照馬可所叙述的，此外，還有許多譏笑耶穌的人在那裏，雖則他們的精神與鬥徒不同，也要把耶穌的話記下。這樣說來，我們可以相信，耶穌在十字架上所說的一切話，都傳一到我們了。所關十字架上的七句話，包括了一切。七句話當中，馬汰記下了一句路路如記下了三句，約翰記下三句。這七句話，代表基督人格和工作的七要點。頭一句是說，　恕。「父阿饒恕他們，因爲他們所做的，他們不明白。』第二句說到救恩。「今天你要同一我在樂園裏了。」這是對悔改的强盜說的。第三句說到愛心，「婦人，愛你的兒了……看你的母親。」第四句說到續罪。「我的上帝，我的上帝，你爲什麼丟棄我。」這表明罪是什麼，和基督爲人續罪所受的痛苦。第五句說到身體所受痛苦。「我渴了」。第六句說到勝利。「成了。」這「成了」三字有人認爲最偉大的字，卽耶穌外，世人不應有此口吻。因爲耶穌的人格完全，無缺點，無瑕疵。所以敢說一成了。「末了一句說到復會的話，「父阿。我將靈魂交給你。」天父的思想慢透了耶穌整個生命，自然，這個時候，他要完全信任的歸回到天父那裏去。現在我們暫將六句話擱置，拿第一句來談談。「父阿，饒恕他們，因爲他們所做的，他們不明白。」這句饒恕的話，於我們這窮乏，軟弱，行邪，多罪，的人有何意義？於這罪惡滿盈的世界，有何意義？有一位老人說，一耶穌敎不能站立，因爲牠是建立在個十字架上，敎主的死亡上，一種大災上，如何能站立？一殊不知耶穌敎所以能歷千數百年越傳越廣，原故正是在此。（待續）</p>

<p>何儷玉道：『慧華姊！你瞧這編輯室的每一桌子上，都有一具電話機。我想　是這些電話機同時說起話來，那個編輯室裏也很爲熱鬧呀。』邵慧華笑道：『你這是一種理想能了，那裏會听有電話，同時說起話來。你是見到外國交易所與銀行裏的直接對講電話，却是四面八方，應接不暇的。這裏是在最上層，另外有個無綫電機室，專接國內個要電的，由電機室譯送下來，交與編輯部。至於每人桌子上的電話機，都是備特別用的。譬如國際間的事，公文未曾發表，而私人間早已知道此事，就可以直接與編輯部通電話。又這事雖然各處喧傳，而實際上並不凖確，這又可以與編輯部說明眞相，從電話中吿知我們一切。現在中國的長途電話，各處都通行了，國內倘有什麼緊要新聞，我們的通信員，一個長途電話，就可以打到報館裏來了。我國的交通機關，對於新聞界又特別的優待扶助，就希望信息的特別快捷。至於本市新聞部，倘然一過夜間十二點鐘，再有什麼新聞，那就全靠電話報道咧。所以本市新聞編輯部的桌子上，電話機特別的多呀。』吳君素道：『夜間十二點鐘以後，再有什麼新聞嗎？要是在我們，夜間至遲到十點鐘，就要安睡了。學校裏，九點鐘就要打熄燈鐘，因爲明天六點鐘大家就要起身。十二點鐘，那我們已是頭　裏了。』邵慧華笑道：『報館裏的事，可以和你們學校裏比嗎？不用說，許多國際電報，都要到半夜　來。因為地球在那裏旋轉，各處時間不同。我們的夜裏，在美國正是白天。你們學校裏　九點鐘打熄燈鐘，人家在美國那時候正上寫宇間咧。那末你想一件美國白天的新聞，立刻到我們中國，不是己在半夜裏了嗎？至於本市新聞呢！上海這樣一個大都市，當然是有夜市的，而且夜市也很遲的。現在娛樂塲，倒已經規定不許通宵的了，但是也有做夜工作的人。譬如我們報館裏，就是做夜工作的。其他工廠中，爲了忙於出貨，也都做夜工作。你說：十二點這以後，就沒有新聞嗎？要知道社會是好像一部大的機器，無日無夜不在那裏動的，一動就有新聞。何况十二點鐘到三點鐘齊版，還有三個鐘頭咧。』</p>

<p>— 家</p>
<p>劉　別謙對嘉寶一向是十分欽佩的，自從為她導演過Ninotehka一片以後，對她更加深一層的認識，下面是他在拍片時對人的談話：</p>
<p>「自從我開始導演生活以來，對於影星方面的接觸很多，各人有各人的特性，譬如嘉寶小姐就有一個特性，她在下午五點鍾以後，就不願意工作了，不過她在早晨九點鍾的時候，就能立刻開始拍戲，一點也沒有怱促的樣子，又因為她的表演很純熟，所以她對於工作進行，十分順利。嘉寶小姐的準時，竟可以將她當作一隻時鐘那樣看待。」</p>
<p>「我以爲嘉寶小姐是我所認識的朋友之間一個　安靜的女子，在好萊塢最安靜的男子當是賈萊古柏，這二個人從不會將他們的情感流露出來，如果你要叫他們兩個人立在羣眾的面前，作一番演說是事實不可能的。」</p>
<p>「一般的女明星，都在拍戲的空閒時間裏要撲上許多香粉，並且要費去許多的時間，但嘉寶小姐就不然，除非我通知她，她從不愛到鏡子裏面，去看她的倩影的。」</p>
<p>「嘉寶小姐最不愛的事情，就是太怱促的事，所以她在五點鍾就不願意再工作，而五點鍾以後的時間，完全是她自己的時間了。」</p>

<p>記　得曾經看過胡蝶主演的一部電影，叫路柳牆花，當時倒沒什麽感觸，前些日看了訥厂君的一篇快樂家庭，却不禁聯想到路柳牆花的問題上來了。我很贊同訥厂的話，所謂舊禮義下的快樂家庭，他是用糖衣包着一種苦水，何以會這樣呢？因為舊禮教中，丈夫對妻子的職責是養活，妻子對丈夫的職責是生育，你想這原則是多麽不平等不合理呢。講到能否生育，根本不是妻子一個人的事，或是丈夫不能生育，或是雙方生理上不配合，難道都要歸責於妻子嗎？以不可歸責於妻子的事，強要歸責於妻子，當然是不通；反之，以出於自然而並非妻子一人之力的生育，就作為妻子已經盡了應盡的職責，也當然是大大的謬誤。所以妻子對丈夫應盡的職責，不是生育，丈夫對妻子應盡的職責，也不僅是養活，雙方應向對方所盡的職責，都是安慰；安是安其身心，慰是慰情緒。一個人在工作之暇，都需要得到一點安慰，丈夫的工作收入足敷一家用度時，妻子應當把家政處理得井井有條，清潔，簡單，樸素，沒有無謂的浪費，有餘時就儲蓄一點，找些正當的娛樂。如果丈夫工作的收入不敷必要開支時，妻子應當幫着賺一點錢，雙方共同負擔着家庭的義務。講到那一邊呢，妻子操持家政辛苦了，丈夫應當同他去玩玩，或是講些有趣的故事給他聽聽，或是共同研究一種有興趣的藝術。我以為夫妻的結合，倒不在乎新式或老式，愛情的維繫，祗有二個條件：一是供給對方的需要，二是體貼對方的情緒，從前舉案齊眉的美談，並不是梁鴻怎樣的有錢有勢，孟光怎樣的美麗妖豔，所以即使自由結婚，假使結合的當時，一方為錢，一方為色，還是沒有好結果的。</p>

<p>以前，桂秋從漢口輾轉到滬，在天蟾舞臺演唱，期滿以後，就回到北平去，離開上海已經有十個月，此番捲土重來，丰資還是依舊，他是陳德霖的嫡派傳人，唱工有獨到之處，而且對於丹青功夫，也有相當研究，像傑作之一「蝴蝶媒」，就有當場繪蝶的表演，有不少坤伶是他的弟子，現在香港的小島的王熙春，卡爾登的金素雯和鄭冰如都是。桂秋的三天打砲戲，已經預定是「蝴蝶媒」，「四郎探母」和「王寶釧」，準下月一日起登臺。</p>
<p>馬君武是馬春樵的兒子，馬連良的姪兒，是少壯派武生之一，和梁慧超完全是兩種作風，前年夏天的時候，曾和連良同班南下，搭過黃金大戲院，觀眾對於他是有相當認識的。還有小生周維俊，在更新初次邀聘平角南下，他也是其中的一員，迭和吳素秋，趙金蓉，梁韻秋，鄭冰如等合演。他的師傅就是和王玉蓉同樣黃金的金仲仁，仲仁對於這位愛徒非常推許，曾說「他的一齣八大鎚在北平是沒有蓋罩的，」這次在上海可以有機會漏一下了。</p>

<p>Binyang: Japanese troops, routed by Chinese forces in Lingshan and retreating to Nanning, launched a two-pronged offensive towards Funan on the 26th. One route was from Shajing (west of Nanning), aiming to cross westwards via Laokou on the Yongfu Road, where Chinese forces are intercepting them. The other route involved over 4,000 troops and over 1,000 horses, advancing westwards along the Xiang-Gui Railway base, suffering heavy casualties after a fierce attack by Chinese forces near Genzhusha (west of Laokou). Fighting continued until late evening. (28th dispatch)</p>
<p>Liuzhou: Chinese forces launched an offensive towards Xixiangtang (west of Nanning) on the afternoon of the 27th, engaging in fierce battles with the Japanese near Taizengwu and other locations. Chinese morale is high, with repeated charges inflicting many Japanese casualties. Fighting continued until the morning of the 28th. (28th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Today, someone asked the Chinese military spokesperson about Japanese propaganda claiming they still held Lingshan. The spokesperson smiled and replied that not only was Lingshan occupied by Chinese forces, but a high-ranking Chinese commander's headquarters was also located there. Chinese forces attacked Lingshan on February 21st and retook the city the next day. Japanese troops retreated in two directions: one towards Nanning and the other towards Qinzhou, with the main force retreating along the Yong-Qin Highway towards Xiaodong. Strong Chinese units are currently in pursuit. Currently, due to the strong Japanese defenses in Nanning, Chinese forces find it difficult to attack, so there are no major military operations in Guinan. At the same time, the Japanese, having been defeated in Lingshan, are also unable to launch a new offensive. (28th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: A Chinese military spokesperson stated today that major battles between Chinese and Japanese forces are expected to occur in two locations: one near Guangzhou along the lower reaches of the Xijiang River, or near Xinhui, and the other on the south bank of the Yangtze River, near Jiujiang and Nanchang. On the 24th of this month, Japanese troops landed near Dongliu on the south bank of the Yangtze River and are now advancing south. (28th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin: Liu Dechang, head of Shajing Township in Yongning County, led a guerrilla team into Shajing Market late one night this month, capturing the puppet maintenance association's chairman, vice-chairman Zhou Puwu, Li Er, and assistant Feng Er. They were executed by firing squad in Tanluo a few days ago. The provincial government, recognizing Liu's courage and loyalty in the face of hardship, has not only recorded his merit as township head but has also instructed the county to grant him a two-grade salary increase as encouragement.

<h3 id="e2">Main Force of Suiyuan Troops Advancing Towards Baotou; Japanese Reinforcements Attempt to Re-Invade Wuyuan; Fierce Fighting on Both Sides of the Wujia River <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Chinese Army spokesperson received reporters this afternoon and, reviewing the week's battle situation, stated that the situation in western Suiyuan is extraordinary. The main force of the Japanese army is launching a western offensive from Baotou, again attempting to seize Wuyuan, while the main force of the Chinese army is advancing from Wuyuan towards Baotou. Although the Japanese army may be able to occupy Wuyuan, according to the latest news received in Chongqing, the Japanese army is still ten miles away from the city's northeastern side. The spokesperson reiterated the importance of the Chinese army retaking Wuyuan, saying that this shows that the Chinese army has the ability to seize strongly defended Japanese positions at an appropriate time as soon as the command headquarters issues an order. (28th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: This office received recent military news from the Chinese side stating that the Japanese army, departing from Baotou with tanks, airplanes, and artillery as support, is determined to invade Wuyuan again and is currently engaged in fierce fighting on both sides of the Wujia River. (28th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to a Chinese military spokesperson today, the Japanese army in Suiyuan is now making every effort to counterattack Wuyuan, so the re-capture of Wuyuan is possible. As of yesterday, the vanguard of the Japanese army had advanced to within ten miles of Wuyuan. Before the 25th, the Japanese army had also counterattacked Wuyuan, but its strength was obviously very weak. However, since then, the Japanese army has received reinforcements of 3,000 fresh troops, carrying twelve heavy artillery pieces and over 1,000 rubber boats, rushing to the Wujia River front. According to the spokesperson, although Wuyuan may be lost again, the Chinese army's victory on the 22nd, the battle to retake Wuyuan, is indeed commendable. In this battle, the number of Japanese officers (including political workers and special agents) annihilated reached 300, and the number captured alive reached 11. (28th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>A certain location in western Suiyuan: When the Chinese army retook Wuyuan, the gains were enormous. In two days, over 300 Japanese middle and high-ranking officers were killed, which is the largest loss for the Japanese. The Japanese are determined to retaliate and are launching a large-scale counterattack. Fierce fighting is occurring everywhere between the Chinese and Japanese forces in the northeast and southeast regions of Wuyuan. The Chinese army is seizing the most advantageous initiative and will launch another large-scale annihilation battle. (28th dispatch)</p>

Chinese forces are in pursuit. (28th dispatch)</p>
<p>Xiangyang: On the morning of the 21st, a mixed force of Japanese infantry, cavalry, and artillery, with four artillery pieces, harassed the Chinese from Qiligang, north of Macheng. They were intercepted by Chinese forces in the Taoji River and Liuhe Temple area, and a cavalry unit launched a fierce attack on the Japanese flanks and rear. By noon, the Japanese were unable to withstand the attack and retreated in disarray, with an estimated 130 killed. (28th dispatch)</p>

<p>Luoyang: A unit of Japanese troops was encircled and attacked by Chinese forces near Yanglaodun (northeast of Xinyang) on the 20th. Chinese forces moved nimbly, and soldiers were brave. After half a day of fighting, over 100 Japanese troops were killed. By evening, the remaining Japanese troops were unable to withstand the attack, broke out, and routed. Chinese forces are in pursuit. (27th dispatch)</p>
<p>City: Japanese troops, numbering 1,500, advancing eastward from Jiyang and Guangshui in three routes, were reinforced by 1,000 troops from Xinyang on the evening of the 21st and continued to flee eastward to the vicinity of Panxindian, Yuecheng, and Longzuzhen. Chinese forces responded calmly, engaging in repeated close combat, and a unit advanced to the rear of the Japanese army, circling to Jiuliguan, cutting off the Japanese retreat route. Another two units launched fierce attacks on the Japanese army's left and right flanks. Threatened by the Chinese army's various forces, the Japanese army began to retreat in panic towards Jiangang on the evening of the 22nd. Chinese forces then recovered Panxindian and other locations and continued to pursue. (27th dispatch)</p>

<p>Chongqing: Moscow dispatch, The News recently commented on the Sino-Japanese War and included a detailed map, saying that after three years of experience, the ruling class of Japan deeply knows that military force cannot conquer China. In the initial stage of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese army occupied a large amount of territory, important industrial centers, railway lines, and major ports due to its superior equipment, but it still failed to defeat the Chinese army or become the true master of the occupied areas. The Japanese side has also failed to destroy the unified solidarity of the Chinese people. For the past three months, the front lines in central China, southern China, and northern China have not changed, which shows the enormous losses in manpower and materials suffered by the Japanese army over the past two years and the high degree of anti-war sentiment within the Japanese army. Under these circumstances, it is not surprising that the Japanese side is stepping up the establishment of puppet organizations. The Japanese side knows that it cannot win militarily, so it uses others to realize its ambitions, but this attempt is also bound to fail because the morale of the Chinese people has not diminished in the slightest and will not compromise until the Japanese army is completely driven out of the country. Any Japanese conspiracy will be difficult to achieve. (27th dispatch)</p>

<p>U.S. Under Secretary of State Mr. Welles was ordered to visit several European powers, meeting with the authorities of Italy, Germany, France, and England. He lingered in Rome, awaiting the return of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German Führer Hitler from their talks. Then, after a long conversation with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, he set off for the United States. Last night's telegram stated that Mr. Welles arrived safely in New York yesterday and immediately proceeded to Washington. According to previous reports, U.S. President Roosevelt or Secretary of State Hull will make a statement to the world after listening to Mr. Welles' report. The actual scope of Mr. Welles' mission and the precise gains of his visits are unknown to outsiders due to the tight-lippedness of all parties involved. Therefore, what the U.S. President or Secretary of State intends to declare is, of course, beyond the scope of anyone's speculation. Nevertheless, what the world is eagerly awaiting in the next few days lies in this. We sincerely wonder how Mr. Roosevelt or Mr. Hull will reassure the world?</p>
<p>From the time of Mr. Welles' visits to European powers until his return to report, international phenomena have been complex and can be interpreted in various ways. Merely skimming the surface of a few phenomena makes it difficult to reach accurate conclusions. For example, in recent days, warring nations have everywhere expressed their determination to fight, actively engaging in various efforts without the slightest slackening, and have also demonstrated the sharpness of their struggle in the international political, diplomatic, and economic spheres. At the same time, the Finnish-Soviet war suddenly took a turn for the worse, leading to peace, and the warring European nations seemed to have some expectations in the military sphere but took no drastic action. This is a new dynamic. On the whole, it is a mixture of joy and sorrow, and it is impossible to lean towards either side. Therefore, it is difficult to say whether Mr. Welles' trip was a success or failure. We earnestly hope that Mr. Welles has had extraordinary gains, and that Mr. Roosevelt, acting decisively, can turn the tide, turning weapons into instruments of peace. Let the three groups of wars in the world be such that the Finnish-Soviet war erupted last and was resolved first, and the war between England, France, and Germany, which began before the Finnish-Soviet war, will be resolved after the Finnish-Soviet war, and then they will jointly plan for the stability of the Far East. The greatest contribution of the United States and the most rational procedure for resolving disputes should be nothing more than this. Perhaps not. If the United States, through Mr. Welles' trip, realizes that the intentions of both sides in the European war are vastly different and that circumstances prevent reconciliation, and that the time for mediation is not yet ripe, then what we earnestly hope that the U.S. President or Secretary of State will declare to the world is to clarify the crux of the European war and to reiterate the U.S. President's interpretation of international peace two weeks ago: namely, true, lasting, stable, just, and reasonable peace is the universal need of mankind and must be based on morality. Based on this interpretation, the intentions of both sides in the European war are measured. By this means, we can answer the universal question of mankind: Are the war between England, France, and Germany and the need for peace fundamentally incompatible? Do both sides agree that peace should be interpreted properly? Is one of the warring parties intentionally controlling or destroying the other party? We firmly believe that civilized peoples will give similar answers to these questions, and this is where the nature of the European war and the nature of the Far East war differ greatly. If the United States, based on Mr. Welles' report, confirms that this answer is not wrong, then although the time for mediating the European situation has not yet ripened, the possibility of mediating will inevitably exist in the long run. We earnestly hope that Mr. Welles' trip has not been in vain, that the European situation can be resolved rapidly due to the U.S. authorities' efforts to mediate based on Mr. Welles' report. If not, even if the implementation of mediation awaits the arrival of opportunity, how to urge both sides to gradually shorten the distance between their vastly different intentions is also an undeniable duty of the United States and something that the U.S. authorities are happy to strive for.</p>
<p>The United States is far away in the New World, standing outside the whirlpool of the current war. Solely because the interests of international politics, diplomacy, and economics are intertwined and closely related, the facts do not allow the United States to close its doors and isolate itself. Therefore, in the past, when three world wars coexisted, the United States devoted its efforts to three things separately. Now that the Finnish-Soviet war is over, and whether the time for mediating the European situation is ripe will also be determined by Mr. Welles' return. If it is ripe, then the United States will, of course, not be lax and will strive for the best possible outcome. If it is not ripe, then the United States will make preparations for mediating the European situation and take effective action to deal with the Far East as another matter. The nature of the Far East war is different from that of Europe; what Europe needs is mediation, what the Far East needs is to curb violence and suppress chaos. Mediation requires the belligerents to be willing to accept it, curbing violence and suppressing chaos does not require the consent of the violent and chaotic. Whether to wait for acceptance depends on whether the opportunity is ripe, there is no need for those who do not need consent to judge the strength and effectiveness of the power. In terms of military strength, the United States must know that it is a strong and unparalleled force, and the large-scale exercises of the navy and air force in the Pacific in the near future will prove the certainty of this strength through testing. Moreover, the United States does not need military force to curb violence and suppress chaos, but only needs determination; in addition, dealing with exhausted adversaries is like crushing dry weeds and rotten wood. In terms of economic strength, embargoes are an effective sanction, as evidenced by the anxiety expressed by Japan after the expiration of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce, which frankly explained it.</p>

In order to intensify the promotion of the Taiwan revolutionary movement in response to the motherland's war of resistance, representatives of both sides discussed it in Chongqing. As a result, it was decided to form a joint federation of Taiwan revolutionary groups, scheduled to be established on the 29th, responsible for overall planning and promotion.

<p>Tokyo The "Tokyo Municipal Employees' Union" implemented its dissolution this week because the government adopted an anti-union attitude after the outbreak of the "China Incident." The union was established in 1924 with 2,000 members, mostly drivers and conductors of buses and streetcars. Three years ago, the union once went on strike for three months demanding increased wages for bus drivers and female ticket sellers, which almost cut off transportation in Tokyo. Eventually, the union won, with a total increase in wages reaching 1.3 million Japanese yen per year. That year, several leaders of the union were arrested due to the surge of nationalism in the country after the "Incident." Hashimoto, chairman of the union's executive committee, told reporters that the union was bowing to nationalism to adapt to the trend of the times. "After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, liberalism and capitalism seem to have declined, so the labor movement has also declared its end." (United Press International, 28th)</p>

<p>London The diplomatic correspondent of The Times claims that Soviet Ambassador Maisky visited Foreign Secretary Halifax yesterday afternoon. This is the first time since relations between the two countries became strained after the Soviet invasion of Finland. All newspapers state that Maisky's visit is related to the detention of the Soviet ship "Mayakovsky," which was escorted to Hong Kong after being intercepted, and the detention of the Soviet ship "Salonga" in Hong Kong. The Soviet side stated that these ships are state-owned and should be treated differently from privately owned vessels. (Reuters, 28th)</p>

However, the British issued orders to the Pacific Fleet to stop contraband goods en route from the United States via Vladivostok and the Siberian Railway to Germany. This is an action that Britain is entitled to take under the rights of belligerents, and this order is now being strictly enforced. Germany is forced to take the long route, which is time-consuming and expensive, to obtain supplies, and its predicament is evident. Now this route has been cut off again. The prevention of the Pacific route is now being strengthened and will soon achieve complete results. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>London The detention of a Soviet ship by British authorities in Hong Kong is increasing friction between Britain and the Soviet Union. It is generally expected here that a large-scale naval and commercial war may arise from this on the vast Pacific Ocean. Although Britain is striving to strictly suppress the smuggling of contraband goods into the Far East in wartime, it does not want to break ties with the Soviet Union as a result. However, the Daily News claims that "the Navy is now trying to close Germany's backdoor in and out of Vladivostok." The report continued, "There are signs that the United States is circumventing the rules and engaging in private contraband trade with Germany. The goods are first loaded onto American ships and transported to Mexico, and then loaded onto Soviet ships from Mexico to Vladivostok, but this move will now be blocked." The London News further stated that the British Navy may be actively at war in the Pacific with German submarines escorting Soviet freighters. According to news obtained from Shanghai, Germany is negotiating with Japan to allow Germany to establish a base on Hainan Island, as the island is located at a key point on the British lifeline between Singapore and Hong Kong and is a strategically important base. The report also said that at least eighty German submarines were being transported to Vladivostok via the Siberian Railway and prepared to be assembled in Whaling Bay near Vladivostok. The Daily News also reprinted a report from the Melbourne Daily News in Australia, stating that the Soviet Union is deploying a tightly organized espionage network in Australia, which will greatly benefit Germany. In view of the above, the general public here believes that the top politicians of Britain and France will soon convene to promote strategies for the war. The Pacific issue and the issue of the United States supplying Germany will also be considered. (International Society, 28th)</p>

It is claimed that Maisky demanded the immediate release of these ships and stated that the British government would be responsible for the losses incurred due to the detention. However, Halifax only promised to conduct an investigation and did not provide a firm guarantee. The "Selega" was carrying ore and tin from Manila to Vladivostok and was intercepted near Taiwan by two British cruisers and immediately escorted to Hong Kong.

<p>Rome Pope Pius XII received Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki this morning for a duration of one and a half hours. The Hungarian ambassador to the Holy See was also present. After the meeting, Teleki introduced his daughter and entourage to the Pope. He then visited Cardinal Maglione, the Vatican Secretary of State. The Hungarian Embassy hosted a banquet for Teleki at noon and invited Maglione and President Roosevelt's representative to the Holy See, Dai Le, to accompany him. (Haitong News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>Rome Political figures claim that the visit of Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki to Italy to talk with Italian authorities has yielded two results: (1) Hungary has accepted Italy's advice and will not raise territorial demands against Romania during the current war. (2) Italy has assured Hungary that it will provide assistance in any circumstances. Foreign observers claim that Prime Minister Teleki made concessions on the first point in deference to Italy's orders. However, the main goal of the trip was to inquire about Italy's true intentions towards Hungary, and this goal has been achieved as desired. This can be seen from the official communiqué issued yesterday, as well as the comments published in the fascist newspapers. Italian journalist Gaida (known as Mussolini's mouthpiece) recently published an article in the semi-official "Italian Daily News" and commented, "Italy and Hungary are both determined to maintain peace in the Balkans and the Danube River Basin, but this does not mean that Hungary's territorial demands will be permanently abandoned for a satisfactory resolution, or that other issues in Southeast Europe can be forgotten. Mussolini knows very well that the idea of peace should be built on a foundation of public good." (Havas, 27th)</p>

<p>Paris Prime Minister Reynaud reported to the Cabinet yesterday that the Soviet Union had agreed to recall Ambassador to Paris Suritz at the request of France. He stated that Suritz was no longer a diplomatic representative because Suritz had sent a telegram to Moscow after the signing of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty, in which he used the term "British and French war provocateurs." The telegram was sent in French and was therefore subject to inspection. A copy has now been sent to Moscow chargé d'affaires Beyed, instructing him to inform the Soviet Foreign Minister that Suritz's actions exceeded the bounds of diplomacy. It was recently announced that Prime Minister Reynaud will visit the capitals of various European countries to consult with the French ambassadors stationed there. He has already met with the French Ambassador to London, Corbin, and will meet with Ambassador Pance in Rome. Yesterday, Soviet sources in this area stated that the date of Suritz's return to Moscow had not yet been determined. After Suritz's return to his country, the Soviet Embassy in France will be managed by Chargé d'Affaires Krabi Visev. A French spokesman told the press, "The Suritz incident should be considered a personal matter concerning the ambassador himself, as Suritz has gone beyond the scope of etiquette." Recently, French Ambassador to Moscow Noah Province has been on sick leave since February, and Ambassador Cici, who is stationed in Moscow, has also returned to England for treatment for the same reason. Also yesterday, French police closely guarded the Soviet Embassy, and all people entering and leaving were interrogated, without exception, including embassy staff. (Taiwan Masses, 28th)</p>

<p>London - According to a special dispatch from here, the Washington Post reports that Britain and France have already achieved victory in the first phase of controlling contraband in the Near East, without encountering strong opposition from the Axis powers. The Allied powers now hold strategically important military locations in the Near East, communication lines, and economic resources, which is disadvantageous to Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union. The Allied military strength in the Near East is gradually increasing. Britain has now expressed its opinion that if Romanian oil continues to be supplied to Germany, Britain will adopt stringent measures to prevent it. An American newspaper in Cleveland states that the Soviet Union cannot supply Germany with sufficient quantities of the three raw materials necessary for warfare: oil, vegetable oil, and manganese. Even if Stalin is confident that aiding Germany can expand Soviet political interests and is willing to seize what belongs to his own people to supply Germany, transportation is the biggest obstacle. The lack of Soviet railways and shipping will ultimately prevent Stalin from fulfilling his wishes. The New York Sun commented on the sinking of German ore-laden ships, saying that this is of great significance at this time. Britain's sinking of such ships is tantamount to opening fire during wartime to cut off the supply of materials necessary for German military operations. If Britain can close this line, Germany will be severely affected. If British submarines can operate deep in the Baltic Sea, the difficulty of Germany transporting ore will be impossible to resolve.

<p>Paris - The Minister of Merchant Marine, Mr. Rivol, delivered a broadcast address this evening, stating that France has a total of 3 million tons of merchant ships. Since the start of the war, only 16 ships have been lost, and only two have been destroyed by the enemy while under escort by warships. Although the number of French merchant ships is considerable, it is still insufficient to transport all the supplies needed by the country during wartime. Fortunately, Britain can allocate its surplus merchant ships for France's use. The total number of merchant ships of the two countries accounts for one-third of the world's total, and the strength is undoubtedly immense. In addition, in order to meet wartime needs, France has to limit the import quantity of various non-essential goods, so as to use the merchant ships freed up for more beneficial transportation. In short, in addition to making every effort to facilitate overseas transportation, Britain and France are also implementing strict inspection measures against Germany. Up to now, these measures have achieved good results, and hundreds of thousands of tons of various goods (especially various ores) have been intercepted by British and French warships on their way to Germany.

Five or six German Messerschmitt fighters, possibly including one Dornier, were shot down by the British Air Force. (United Press dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>London - Reuter's correspondent stationed in France cabled that the British Air Force in France shot down at least five enemy aircraft yesterday. Two other enemy aircraft are also believed to have been shot down, while the British lost one fighter. During patrols by British Hurricane aircraft yesterday morning, afternoon, and evening, they encountered four different types of German aircraft, resulting in three aerial battles. The five aircraft shot down were reportedly all Messerschmitt models. Another Messerschmitt, a Dornier, is also believed to have been shot down. A British pilot, a New Zealander, only 21 years old, who had previously gained fame in the Air Force for shooting down three enemy aircraft, shot down two more Messerschmitt aircraft yesterday. However, he narrowly escaped disaster during the engagement, being hit in the leg by shrapnel. He limped back to base, recounting the battle to his comrades, saying that shortly after noon, he and the pilots of two other Hurricane aircraft engaged nine Messerschmitt enemy aircraft. He attacked one by one, and soon hit one aircraft, which caught fire and crashed. After a brief melee, he shot down another enemy aircraft. The sky was clear, and he turned his head to look around, only to see another enemy aircraft, which had been watching the battle, diving down towards him. He immediately heard a terrifying bang, the engine cover was shot off, and the fuselage had a large jagged hole. Gasoline and flames sprayed into the cockpit. He was shocked and lost consciousness, but quickly regained it. He then tried to get out of the aircraft, and after a long time, he untied the parachute cord, and floated down. He was dizzy and felt a cold air rushing towards his face. As he passed through a thick cloud layer, he almost thought he was entering heaven. He landed in the no man's land between the two armies, and staggered into the forest, hiding the parachute with weeds. A French captain, holding a pistol, ran towards him. Recognizing that he was British, he helped him return to the French lines. Two other Hurricane British aircraft each pursued an enemy aircraft. One, piloted by an officer, fiercely attacked the enemy aircraft, causing it to catch fire and crash. Another British aircraft, piloted by a soldier, returned and reported that the enemy aircraft he was chasing disappeared into the clouds. Air Force Commander Barratt sent a telegram congratulating the British aircraft pilots. The entire camp was excited when this telegram arrived. (Reuter's dispatch on the 28th)</p>

In the above two aerial battles, the German Air Force suffered no losses. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>London - The British Air Ministry stated that yesterday, while conducting reconnaissance over the North Sea, the British Air Force attacked and sank an enemy patrol boat. The German ship was drifting downstream in the eastern North Sea. The British aircraft dived to attack amidst intense anti-aircraft fire. There were four enemy ships in total, but the British aircraft only selected one of them as the target, dropping bombs on it. It was witnessed that the bombs exploded on the deck with a loud sound. Thick smoke and flames rose upwards. The British aircraft ascended into the clouds after dropping the bombs. When they reappeared, only three ships were visible, and only a patch of foamy water remained where the bombed German ship had been. (Reuter's dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>Helsinki - Finnish President Kallio said in a speech to Parliament yesterday that although the Finnish people have suffered from the ravages of war, they will continue to work hard for the future. We are saddened by the disasters Finland has encountered, and we are grateful that the Finnish people understand their responsibilities. The independence of Finland, the loyalty of the Finnish people, and the army still exist today. All of these are cornerstones for us to continue building the future. The defensive capabilities of the Finnish army are now vastly different from what they were at the beginning of the war. (Haitong dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>Helsinki - When Finnish Prime Minister Ryti took office, he declared that the main task of the new government is to begin promoting the peaceful reconstruction of the country. Our foreign policy will aim for peace and neutrality, and establish friendly and trusting relationships with all countries. The national defense construction of Finland will be based on the new situation and past experience. About one-eighth of our compatriots are unemployed and destitute, and they must be able to live and work in peace again. The government will promptly provide effective assistance, and the people must also determine their contributions according to the amount of accumulated capital. After this war, Finland lost about 10% of its resources, farmland, and industrial products. The cession of the Karelian Isthmus caused Finland to lose 17% of its national railway and even more of its roads. After the fall of the Saimaa Canal entrance, the inland losses were also destructive. Finland ceded several important ports, resulting in significant losses in foreign trade, and even domestic finance, currency, and purchasing power were hit hard. If we want to restore the losses suffered in the new territory, we must work diligently and tirelessly. Such as food production, forest reclamation, the establishment of new industries, the development of water conservancy projects, the improvement of water and land transportation, roads, and ports, and the restoration of international trade relations, are all essential tasks.

During the Easter holidays, Finnish troops continued to carry out the withdrawal work without rest. Some old border areas are about 120 kilometers away from the new border. Because the ice and snow along the road have not yet melted, it is quite difficult for ordinary civilians to withdraw from the ceded areas to the new border.

<p>Brussels - Belgian Senator Doerna gave a speech to Parliament, stating that the Belgian King announced a policy of neutrality on October 14, 1936. At present, Belgium is still following this foreign policy, because even strong countries are in danger of losing territory during warfare. Belgium is a small industrialized country with a dense population. Once war breaks out, it will inevitably suffer disaster. Therefore, Belgium's policy of neutrality is not due to fear, cowardice, or attempts to take advantage of the situation, but to maintain Belgium's economic prosperity. Military actions are enough to destroy national finances and private enterprises, and Belgium relies on export trade as the main source of national wealth. Doerna concluded that the Belgian people support the government's policy of strictly adhering to neutrality. (Haitong dispatch on the 28th)</p>

In the future, private manufacturers who want to purchase tea from foreign countries must obtain a permit from the government, because the government has already controlled the tea trade. In addition, the tea needed by Britain in the future should be purchased from various autonomous territories and domestic territories. The government has signed contracts with tea merchants from various parts of the empire, and the validity period is set for one year, that is, from January 1st to December 31st of this year. As for the price, the average price from 1936 to 1938 will be used as the standard. If costs increase due to the war, the government also intends to consider providing subsidies.

<p>London - The Manchester Guardian commented on the downward trend of tin prices, saying that the price of tin in US dollars is now cheaper than before the war. The tin production quota can now be reduced again to raise market prices. The temporary setback after the promulgation of the new foreign exchange regulations was expected. However, American buyers cannot stop buying tin for a long time simply because they have to pay a few more dollars, because most of the tin supply comes from British territories. The US tin inventory is indeed smaller than the current demand, indicating that consumers are now using their previous high-priced inventories and are unwilling to take advantage of the current low prices to replenish them. There is probably no other reason for this than the expectation of a reduction in future consumption. (Reuter's dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<p>Washington - During the House of Representatives meeting yesterday, Mr. Boling, to the Congress , the cracks of the US Army's aircraft for sale to the Allies are now clear. The President has approved a new policy of selling new types of American aircraft to the Allies immediately. In order to ensure that military secrets are not leaked and that the expansion of the US Air Force is not delayed, the Army Department is adjusting its policy on selling aircraft to foreign countries in all aspects. For example, it stipulates that aircraft drawings owned by the Army Department or its manufacturers shall not be transmitted overseas for imitation or assembly. He formulated this policy "without being forced or pressured by anyone." Senior officials of the Army also spoke, stating that with the current expansion of production facilities, the United States will be able to produce 30,000 to 40,000 aircraft per year after the end of this year. The House Military Affairs Committee has indirectly approved the government's policy of selling aircraft to foreign countries. Several aircraft manufacturers then met with government officials to discuss ways to expedite the processing of foreign aircraft orders. (Reuter's dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<h3 id="e64">The Dutch Ship "Waterland" - Chinese Crewmembers Encountered a Sinking - Confirmed: Only One of Twenty-One Chinese Crewmembers Injured <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The Hague dispatch: In the past half-year, as the European War has intensified again, the competition of feints has sought to determine victory on the seas. For example, in mid-February, Xue Yitulu, a waterman serving on the Dutch ship "Saluria," told people that his ship was fortunate to be carrying non-flammable asphalt. En route, it struck a mine, and the hull was breached. Fortunately, the compartments were isolated, and the engine remained intact, allowing it to travel for two days to reach a British port, and then another day to the Netherlands. This is one example. Looking at the thousands of Chinese sailors serving on merchant ships of neutral countries, the most vivid experience of explosions was the incident on February 18th of this year (1940).</p>
<p>At around 9 a.m. that morning, the Dutch ship "Waterland," which had set sail from Luotang the previous evening, was heading south towards Asia when it was suddenly bombed near the Xiezi Sandbar, about fifteen nautical miles northwest of Xiekuidao Island in the Dutch province of Haizhou. Its position was 51 degrees 45 minutes north latitude and 2 degrees 18 minutes east longitude. The ship was equipped with mine deflectors but was still bombed. Whether it was destroyed by a submarine's torpedo remains unconfirmed. It is said that the ship's cargo was divided into five holds. The engine room, located under the smokestack, was between the third and fourth holds. The fifth hold was bombed and ruptured, taking on water first. Of the four lifeboats on the ship, one remained intact after the explosion and was immediately launched. In the instant of the explosion, a loud noise came from the rear of the ship, with wooden splinters and iron scraps flying everywhere. Fortunately, all fifty-one people on board remained calm and did not panic, allowing them to board the lifeboat together. Among them, the firemen from Dongguan and Bao'an counties in Guangdong Province were awakened from their sleep in the rear of the fifth hold when the explosion occurred. Among the stokers on duty in the boiler room, the chief fireman, Shen Lai, suffered serious injuries, fracturing his lumbar vertebra near the surface of the skin, with jagged protrusions and swollen, festering muscles around it. Ye Xiang, Deng Lai, Yuan Sen, and Zhuang Zhonghua suffered minor injuries. The remaining sixteen people, including Li Cai, Lu Yao, Deng Zhu, Zhong Tian, Liang Jiu, Zhan Liang, Huang Sheng, Ye Zu, Qiu An, Yuan Qingyao, Lin Fu, Zhang Long, Chen Fa, Zhang Jin, Xie Pei, and Hu Jian, were unharmed and boarded another Dutch ship that came to rescue them, along with the Western crewmembers. However, as the lifeboat moved away from the "Waterland," it was small and carried many people, and the seawater barely cleared the top of the boat. Fortunately, a British plane arrived overhead to watch over them, sending reassuring signals until the rescue ship appeared on the horizon, and the crowd's anxiety was finally relieved. Finally, the captain of the "Waterland" and a few senior crewmembers, realizing that the ship was not sinking very quickly, returned to the original ship on the newly emptied lifeboat and struggled to climb back onto the deck to salvage documents and some important items. However, Cai and carbon monoxide gas gradually began to appear in the ship, so they dared not stay any longer. Later, they saw that the undamaged part of the original ship was also taking on water and was being towed close to the shore. By 12:45 p.m., the 4,537-ton cargo ship had completely sunk.</p>
<p>Afterward, the captain and all the crewmembers who were fortunate enough to be unharmed or not seriously injured were taken by the rescue ship to Mu Chuan Gate, west of Luotang City, to disembark and return to Luotang by car. Among the twenty-one Chinese sailors, only Shen Lai remained in the "Holy Education Shuo Hospital" in Feixing Port, Haizhou, Netherlands. The four who were slightly injured returned to Luotang for treatment at the Sailors' Hospital. The loss of clothing due to the accident was reported to Consul Feng in Apbu by the Luotang Overseas Chinese Association, and negotiations were made with the company. At the same time, the Luotang Overseas Chinese Association, signed by Zhou Gui, who was also the secretary, sent a letter of condolence to Shen Lai, who was hospitalized for treatment.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the war, the most distressing incident was on March 18th. Before dawn that day, two British ships collided in the sea off Ireland because they were traveling at high speed with their lights off to avoid enemy aircraft. One of the ships sank within three minutes, which was truly a tragedy. In that critical moment, the chief officer, Xi Lai, hurriedly grabbed a plank and jumped into the sea, while the other crewmembers struggled to cling to it. Gao Lai sang loudly, remaining calm in the face of danger to dispel fear. It was also heard that Bi Lai, an old sailor who had been working on ships for 31 years and could not swim, had twice experienced the danger of torpedo explosions and survived. In this incident, liquid rubber spilled onto the sea, rendering swimming skills useless. Bi Lai groped in the darkness and fell from the deck into the cabin. Thinking he had no hope of escape, he unexpectedly found a plank. As the ship tilted and sank, he was thrown out of the ship. Because he had the plank, he was calmly rescued. These are all experiences of escaping danger that travelers should remember.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Serious Food Situation in Fujian Province - Each Stone Has Risen to Ninety-Two Yuan - Provincial Government Has Stipulated Corrective Measures <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou dispatch: Food prices in Fujian Province have been rising in recent months, exceeding the general price index in various places, which is unreasonable. In order to correct this, the provincial government has stipulated three measures and ordered all counties to comply with them. They are listed below: (1) Stipulate the prices of rice, wheat, and barley. All prices will temporarily be based on the local market price on February 20 of this year as the maximum and may not rise further. First, stabilize the market price, and then seek reasonable price reductions. If farmers and merchants hoard and speculate on the basis of this restriction, the local government should force the sale of their registered grain reserves. Violators will have their grain confiscated and will be punished according to law. The wholesale and retail prices of rice, wheat flour, potatoes, and other commodities in the market will not be evaluated, but the local government will restrict the profits of merchants at all levels to no more than 10%. The standard of restriction will be announced by the local government to ensure that sources with different costs can be concentrated in the market without obstruction. If the profit exceeds the limit, the offender will be punished according to law. The above is the initial decision of the government to stabilize food prices. (2) Because local authorities in rice-producing areas and rice-deficient areas often cannot take care of each other due to different circumstances regarding food matters, the responsibility of local authorities in rice-deficient areas is to first collect and sell local surplus grain to the market. If the amount is insufficient, grain merchants will be ordered to transport grain from outside. Strictly supervise the responsibility of local authorities in rice-producing areas to be fully responsible for supplying rice-deficient areas, not only to assist in purchasing but also to assist in transportation. In the future, the provincial government will designate a certain county to supply the grain shortage of a certain county according to local sales habits, current situation, and necessary changes. If there is any attempt to shirk responsibility or the supply is not coordinated, the responsibility will be discussed according to the above division of responsibilities. The district sales method has been implemented since March 11. Each county will telegraph the provincial government the minimum quantity that must be transported in or may be exported each month for reference. (3) It was decided to announce on March 20 the measures to crack down on food hoarding and speculation. If merchants and farmers have purchased, stored, and harvested grain that has not been registered or has been registered incorrectly, in addition to confiscating all undeclared or underreported grain, a fine equal to the value of the hoarded grain will be imposed. Those with a large quantity will be sent to military judicial organs for punishment. Fearing that ignorant villagers may mistakenly violate the law, the provincial government has ordered all counties to inform the people of the county of the registration before the promulgation of the measures to crack down on hoarding. Those who have registered incorrectly or have not registered are allowed to voluntarily apply for supplementary registration before March 20. If they delay any further, they will be punished according to the law and will not be tolerated. The county governments are instructed to explain to the people that the government's intention of registering grain reserves is purely to understand the surplus and shortage of grain in various places in order to make overall arrangements. After the provincial government issued the above three measures, the price of rice in Minhou, Lianjiang, Changle, Luoyuan, and other counties belonging to Fuzhou has fallen from 45 yuan to 40 yuan per stone (100 catties), and the price of grain has also fallen from 22 yuan to 20 yuan per stone.</p>
<p>Another report: The price of rice in Fuzhou City has recently risen to 92 yuan per stone because Wang Meihui, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and Cao Xiaosan, Pan Yaosheng, Chen Dengying, Xue Kexiang, Xu Gaoren, Huang Yifei, Zheng Zhong, Wang Tiru, Wang Guchen, Dong Lesan, Guan Deyu, and others jointly formed a rice industry consortium to manipulate grain. They blocked rice boats from the outside, not allowing free trading, and hoarded and speculated on the inside, sharing the spoils and getting rich. As a result, the common people could not bear the hunger, and there were daily reports of people committing suicide by jumping into the river, taking poison, or hanging themselves. This is truly a serious problem in Fujian Province.</p>

<p>Jiangyin dispatch: Since the Japanese army took control of the Yangtze River shipping industry in the ten townships southeast of Chengyi, Huayangjun Town, the port of Shiyiwei has become a hub for goods, on par with Hupu. For the convenience of transportation, the Japanese army has recently been forcibly recruiting farmers in the Yangjun area, paying four jiao for skilled labor and two jiao for unskilled labor, to build a highway from Yangjun to Shiyiwei Port. The route passes through Donglai Town, demolishing shops along the dyke, leaving many people homeless. The highway construction plan intends to include major towns in the vicinity, such as Fushan Luyuan, Xinzhuang, Masi Bridge, Futian Town, Shierwei Port, and Huashu, connecting them to the mouth of the Yangtze River and linking them to the existing Yangjian Fushan Highway and Chengxi Highway. The purpose is nothing more than to achieve their goal of exploitation.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Ding Zihuan, Head of the Puppet Autonomous Association of Dinghai, Was Assassinated - Mortally Wounded by Clubbing on the Head <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Dinghai dispatch: Ding Zicheng, the head of the puppet autonomous committee of this county, was a respected member of the community, a successful candidate in the late Qing imperial examinations, and once served as the magistrate of En'an County, Yunnan. After the Republic of China was established, he served as the first magistrate of Dinghai County. Because he always decided cases quickly, people called him "Seventh Master." However, he was cunning and resourceful, and he was even more skilled at exploiting the people. The people of the county hated him very much. Even his second son, Songsheng, strongly opposed his actions and once broke off the father-son relationship, which shows that he was despised by everyone. Later, because of his old age, he lived in seclusion at home and did not ask about worldly affairs, so many people hoped that he could maintain his integrity in his later years. However, when Dinghai fell last summer, Ding, despite his advanced age, was shameless and took up a puppet position, resuming his means of exploiting the people to enrich himself. At about 9 p.m. the other day, Ding was walking back to his residence from the puppet office when two strong men suddenly jumped out of the darkness and struck Ding's head with clubs as he passed through Shuaiqi Lane. Ding was caught off guard and, because he was over seventy years old, immediately fell to the ground with a bleeding head. His injuries were so serious that he died on the spot. The two strong men then calmly fled. Afterward, Ding's followers reported to the Japanese puppets, and the Japanese army imposed martial law and conducted a thorough search, but found nothing.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Schools Lower Flags Today - Solemnly Commemorating Revolutionary Martyrs - Holiday for One Day in Accordance with Ministry of Education Regulations <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Today is the 31st anniversary of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang. At the same time, we commemorate Deng Shengyuan, Hu Zhantang, Chen Yingshi, Liao Zhongkai, Zhu Zhixin, and Huang Keqiang. All levels of schools in this city will, as usual, take a holiday for one day and lower the flags to mourn. In this special situation, a large-scale memorial service cannot be held. Each school will separately convene teachers and students to describe the great achievements of the martyrs. We should inherit the legacy of the martyrs and rescue the country from danger. Recently, news of victories has been frequently reported from the western Sui and southern Guangxi battlefields. The people of Shanghai are doubly excited. Our colleagues in the education field should firmly support the national policy and complete the great cause of winning the war of resistance and building the nation. In accordance with the Ministry of Education's academic regulations, all levels of schools in this city will have a spring vacation for one week from April 1 to April 8, when classes will resume as usual.</p>
<p>The Educational Association Encourages the City's Educators</p>
<p>The Shanghai Educational Association issued a letter encouraging the city's educators, saying, "As we encounter this grand and solemn Martyrs' Revolutionary Memorial Day, we feel doubly saddened and grieved. Our colleagues in the education field must not merely comply with regulations and take a day off, thinking that is enough. We must have a thorough understanding of this tragic event, glorious history, and valuable lessons, and we must have an effective expression so that we may not fail this program on this, the nineteenth year of the Republic of China. (1) After the Prime Minister advocated the revolution, he launched several uprisings, all of which failed. Among them, the martyrdom of the seventy-two martyrs in the Huanghuagang battle was the greatest sacrifice, and its impact on the success of the Xinhai Revolution was also the greatest. From this, we can know that failure is a necessary stage before success in anything, and the more times we fail, the more hope we have of success. The greater the achievement of sacrifice, the more confidence we have in victory. That is to say, in whatever we do, we must first have a firm and unyielding ambition, recognize our own doctrine, and adhere to our own position, not being discouraged by failure or compromising halfway because of sacrifice. Success is what everyone desires, but if we cannot succeed, we should have the courage and determination to die for our cause. This is why the seventy-two martyrs will be remembered forever and admired by later generations. (2) The Battle of Huanghuagang was a manifestation of the great unity of the Qing Dynasty's revolutionary comrades, with the entire party's manpower and financial resources united as one. Although it did not succeed at the time, this tragic and enthusiastic spirit of sacrifice was enough to shock heaven and earth and deeply impress the Manchu Qing government. Fear and chaos spread, and the Manchu Qing government was so afraid of revolutionaries. Therefore, after the Battle of Huanghuagang, even if the revolutionary army had only one soldier, it could defeat the Manchu Qing government's million-strong army. The victory of the Xinhai Revolution was not due to the strength of the revolutionary army, nor was it due to the laxity of the Qing government's defenses. The main factor was the spirit of great unity among the revolutionary comrades. This is another significance of our remembrance of the martyrs. Today, we are fighting the war of resistance on the one hand and working hard to eradicate traitors on the other. The situation is worse than at the end of the Qing Dynasty, and the responsibility is greater than that of the martyrs. We should emulate the martyrs' spirit of fearlessness and take it as a banner. We should emulate the martyrs' actions of great unity and take them as a warning. We should also take this opportunity to instill the glorious history of the martyrs in students and make them thoroughly understand that achieving success and achieving ren are one and the same thing. Having the perseverance to achieve ren is the only way to achieve success. Without the courage to achieve ren, it is just a matter of luck, which will not only fail to achieve success but will also lead to debt. Traitors are willing to bet everything on the nation and the country, which is because they do not understand the relationship between achieving success and achieving ren. I hope that the entire education community in our city will accept this valuable lesson with sincerity and express it in action, achieve the goal of eliminating traitors and eradicating violence, and complete the mission of resisting Japan and building the nation."</p>

<h3 id="e80">Financial - US Dollar Nears Six Yuan Mark - Bulls Aggressively Buy 300,000 Yuan - Sterling Soars Yesterday <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in listed exchange rates. The unofficial sterling-dollar exchange rate trended sideways, showing signs of recovery. However, due to the exchange rate decline, the market was mixed, with periods of tightness and looseness. The US dollar exchange rate, initially expected to rise, continued to fall by 1/8 of a cent, resulting in a situation where the central rate remained flat while the US dollar tightened. The rates were 4/1/8 of a cent and 6.03125 yuan, respectively. Nevertheless, the general expectation for the US and sterling exchange rates today is still bullish. Chinese merchants and speculators, seeking to profit, aggressively bought over 50,000 pounds of sterling and sold over 200,000 yuan of US dollars. Soon, Hong Kong also sold, and foreign banks like HSBC showed weak appetite, suddenly turning hard. Around 11 a.m., sterling reached 4/1/7/8125 of a cent, and the US dollar reached 6.01875 yuan. By midday, selling pressure eased slightly, and the situation stabilized somewhat. In the early afternoon, there was continued selling from Hong Kong and speculators, still showing a loose trend.

It has been twenty-nine years. The martyrs shed their blood and sacrificed their lives, regarding death as going home. This great sacrifice and immortal spirit influences the psychology of the people, awakens the awareness of compatriots across the country, and influences the actions of the people, inspiring the struggle of compatriots across the country. Finally, it laid the foundation for the Wuchang Uprising. Today, when we hold the commemoration, everyone should think about how to continue to work hard to comfort the spirits of the martyrs in heaven. What did the martyrs follow the late Premier in devoting themselves to the National Revolution for? This has been clearly instructed to us in the Premier's will. Its purpose is to seek freedom and equality for China. Since July 7th, the Japanese have used aircraft and artillery to advance their so-called continental policy, trying to suppress our hoped-for freedom and destroy our expected equality. Then we must rise up to resist aggression in order to achieve the goal of the National Revolution. This resolution to resist aggression, everyone knows, is a long-term resistance. Naturally, we cannot wait until the victory of the war of resistance before building the country, because the purpose of building the country is also to seek freedom and equality for China. Victory in the war of resistance and success in building the country will inevitably lead to the attainment of freedom and the realization of equality. Therefore, our support for the national policy of resisting aggression and building the country is a practical point that should be done in the voice of commemorating the martyrs. The process of resisting aggression has entered the stage of victory, and the program of building the country has reached the time of success. Some people have betrayed from the ranks of resisting aggression and national construction, insulting the Premier's will and distorting the true meaning of peace, and destroying China's freedom and equality themselves. Therefore, our launching of the anti-traitor movement is another practical point that should be worked hard in the voice of commemorating the martyrs. Compatriots, we support the central government, we obey the President, resisting aggression and building the country on one hand, and eliminating traitors on the other hand. The martyrs are smiling, watching, waiting, waiting for the early arrival of freedom and equality in China."</p>
<p>Shanghai Memorial Service: Various Parties Send Condolences</p>
<p>Chongqing, 28th - On the 29th, the Revolutionary Martyrs' Memorial Day, the Shanghai Lone Army Camp will also hold a memorial service on the same day to commemorate the 811 martyrs who died in the Four-Line Warehouse battle and Battalion Commander Yang who died of overwork. All the important figures in the central government deeply commend the past glory of the Lone Army Camp. Chairman Lin has decided to send condolences to Shanghai. Chairman Lin inscribed "Gan Cheng for the Country," Chairman Chiang Kai-shek "Make My Great Wall," and He Yingqin "Fulfill Responsibility and Defend the Territory." The Central Executive Committee jointly wrote "Being Mountains and Rivers on Earth, Being Sun and Stars in Heaven, Taking Righteousness to Achieve Benevolence After Wars," "Good at Forging Spears and Shields, Good at Practicing Armor, Martyr Flag Guards the Country for Thousands of Autumns." Wu Kaixian jointly wrote "Born as a Hero, Died as a Spirit, Taking Righteousness to Achieve Benevolence, the Revolution Is Passed Down by Seventy-Two Warriors," "Merit in the Country, Martyrdom in the Party, Admiring Merit and Repaying Virtue, Leaving Fragrance to Watch for Thousands of Autumns."</p>
<p>Youth Organizations Urge Citizens</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League issued a declaration in memory of the martyrs, encouraging citizens to work hard, save the country, support the central government, and strengthen their belief that the war of resistance will surely be won and the country will surely be built, so as to complete the great task of resisting aggression and national reconstruction, recover lost ground, and glorify China as soon as possible. The Lide Friendship Association encouraged the citizens, saying, "At this time of commemorating the revolutionary martyrs, we should, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, emulate the spirit of the martyrs who devoted themselves to the revolution and regarded death as going home, eliminate the evil-doers, and eliminate the good for the country." Shanghai Loyalty Society's announcement to citizens said, "Fellow compatriots, today is the anniversary of the death of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang. Recalling the enthusiasm of the compatriots' revolutionary sentiments and the spirit of generously sacrificing themselves at that time, it really evokes our infinite emotions. Our China, since interacting with foreign countries, has seen a decline in all aspects of culture, military, and politics. The great powers see our weaknesses, so there are always oppressions in negotiations. If we open the history of the late Qing Dynasty, which one is not a fact of our country and nation being invaded and oppressed by foreign nations? The Manchu Qing government still did not think about reforming and strengthening itself to consolidate the foundation of the country. Dr. Sun Yat-sen was born at the right time and deeply knew that the country could not be revitalized without overthrowing the Manchu Qing Dynasty, so he called on comrades to carry out the revolution with the goals of nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood. Although it went through ten failures, the Wuchang Uprising received a response from the masses, and the Manchu Qing government was half overthrown. The deep penetration of national concepts and national consciousness among the people was really promoted by the great power of the revolutionary patriots at that time. Therefore, the martyrdom of the Seventy-Two Martyrs led to the Wuchang Uprising, and the Wuchang Uprising led to a response across the country. How can we not deeply express our respect for the achievements of the sages? However, compatriots, now our country is suffering from external oppression, even more than in the past. The responsibilities we can bear are also even greater than in the past. Please see how the enemy has painstakingly planned for years, and how their current conspiracies and tricks are. We must not just express our respect. We must use our blood to do it, to continue the spirit of the sages, to eliminate national traitors internally, to resist the strong externally, and to recover our lost land, creating an independent and complete country. This is how we commemorate the Seventy-Two Martyrs and also do not forget our Premier."</p>
<p>Points of Propaganda for the Integrity and Shame Movement</p>
<p>The Integrity and Shame Movement Committee of all circles in this city telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the soldiers at the front to congratulate them on the victory, and paid their respects. At the same time, they announced to all circles, districts, and industries that the regiment members would be dispatched to carry out propaganda to the citizens in accordance with the propaganda points for the Revolutionary Martyrs' Memorial prepared by the committee in advance, urging citizens to stick to their posts, and writing various eye-catching slogans, which were posted on telephone poles and walls on various roads, such as: (1) People with ambition and enthusiasm should know integrity and shame; (2) Do you accept shameless money? (3) Are you participating in a shameless cause? (4) You have gone astray and embarked on the road of shamelessness, quickly repent and return; (5) We must promote integrity and shame, and we must have a spirit that is not threatened or tempted by profit; (6) We must temper our aspirations, promote the integrity and shame movement, and save China's peril; (7) We must develop the virtues of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame to enrich our spiritual national defense, etc.</p>
<p>Concession Authorities Are Closely Guarded</p>
<p>The police authorities of the British and French concessions, because today is the Revolutionary Martyrs' Day, sincerely fear that bad elements will take the opportunity to disrupt public order, so they decided to implement emergency precautions from 5:00 this morning. In addition to prohibiting illegal gatherings and parades, posts have been increased on various roads and transportation routes, and car patrol teams and search teams have been dispatched to patrol in various districts. Anyone with suspicious behavior of pedestrians and vehicles will be inspected. In addition, the defense forces stationed in Shanghai and the International Settlement Volunteers are also mobilized to assist the police authorities in maintaining order to ensure the safety of the area.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Increased Source: Rice Prices Turn Down <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The entire rice market in Shanghai City has been manipulated by speculators, holding the spot goods, so that the market price has tended to rise again. Yesterday, after the rice shop tea party market opened at 9:00, people's hearts were weak, big households had no intention of continuing to enter, and small households also showed a wait-and-see attitude. The number of spot goods increased, and the market price fell back. As a result, it fell by about one yuan, and the source of rice and grain also arrived at the port one after another. Yesterday, it was estimated that more than 3,000 bags of domestic rice were transported by wheels, and 38,000 bags of foreign rice were transported by the Sazhe wheel managed by the Zha Hua Company from Yangon. Due to the gradual shrinking of rice prices, restaurants, taverns, package meal shops, and dim sum shops have all reduced prices one after another, and the general public is celebrating. However, the Fuxin and Fufeng flour mills continue to supply fair-priced flour, and the price insists on the number of 13 yuan per bag, and the bureau continues to negotiate. According to the general opinion of the public, it is believed that the problem of people's food cannot be delayed. The raw materials of the flour currently sold by the factory are all purchased earlier, so the price of fair-priced flour can be lowered.</p>

<p>The Continental News reported that, according to reliable sources, there were 14 Japanese transport ships at the mouth of the Yangtze River on the 25th. According to people who came to Shanghai via the mouth of the Yangtze River, each ship seemed to be empty, and it was expected to be loaded and transferred from the Japanese army in the Yangtze River. As for when each ship would arrive at the mouth of the Yangtze River to stop or stay there for a long time, it is not known. Observers said that the Japanese army in Shanghai seems to have a large-scale transfer.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Three Blood Cases Occurred Within Two Hours Yesterday Morning: Xue Xianyang Shot Near Paramount Hotel; Ma Shaoquan Shot at the Entrance of Fulili Road Xicun; Xu Shen Shot Three Times on Hongkou Hanbi Li Road <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, three assassination cases occurred one after another within two hours in the French Concession of the Public Concession. The protagonists of the three cases were Xue Xianyang, a member of the current "Two-Road Party Department," Ma Buquan, and Xu Shen, a reporter for the Xin Shen Bao. After the above three cases occurred, all circles were shocked. The details obtained in each case are recorded in detail below.</p>
<p>Xue Xianyang</p>
<p>A shooting occurred near the Paramount Ballroom in West Shanghai at about 8:26 yesterday morning. The person shot was Xue Xianyang from Wusong, who was shot four times. He was later taken to Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road for treatment. Because of the serious injuries, his life was in danger. Xue Xianyang is 38 years old, a native of Wusong, with children. He lived at 7 Lane 259 Yu Yuan Road. Before the war, he was a section member of the Machinery Department of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways. He is currently the so-called "Executive Committee Member of the Two-Road Party." Xue goes to the "Two-Road Employees' Correspondence Office" at 416 Sichuan Road every day to work, and is very active. At around 8:26 yesterday morning, Xue was wearing a light-colored French flannel suit, a woolen overcoat, a felt hat, and yellow leather shoes. As usual, he went to Sichuan Road to work. When passing near the Paramount Ballroom on Yu Yuan Road, he was about to take a public bus east on the road when suddenly two people ambushed on the side of the road. Seeing Xue approaching, they suddenly shot and fired four bullets, all of which hit. Two bullets penetrated his chest from the back, and two bullets hit his buttocks. He fell beside the stone steps in front of the Lao Juxing Fruit Shop at No. 237, and blood flowed out. At that time, the shooter took the opportunity to escape into the crowd. After being wounded, Xue was still conscious at the time and could barely open his mouth to ask the guards to urgently call an ambulance to take him to Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road. Because the Jing'an Temple Police Station in charge was nearby, he ordered Chinese and foreign detectives to rush to the scene. They took the injured person to Fumin Hospital, retrieved several empty bullet casings around the scene, and took them back to the police station for research.</p>
<p>Ma Shaoquan</p>
<p>Ma Shaoquan, a native of Wuxi, who lives at 8 Xicun, 355 Lane, Fulili Road, French Concession, is 46 years old this year. He was a member of the Shanghai Municipal Coal Ash Industry Association. He is currently the general manager of Lixin Printing and Dyeing Factory, a printing and dyeing company of American Liming Knitting Company. Ma usually travels in his own car. Recently, he hired Xu Bingfa from Hebei as a bodyguard, who follows him armed every day. At 9:40 am yesterday, Ma and his bodyguard Xu Bingfa took a car from their residence in Xicun to go to work. Ma sat in the back of the car, and Xu sat with the driver. When the car had just driven out of the lane on Xicun Road, four men suddenly rushed out from the side of the road and ran to Ma's car. One man held a large stone and smashed Ma's car, shattering the car window into a large hole. Two people in front of the car prevented the car from moving forward, and another man took out a pistol and shot more than ten shots at Ma and the bodyguard. Ma was shot once in the left shoulder and right arm, and the right buttock was scratched by a bullet. The bodyguard Xu Bingfa was shot in three places, two bullets in the abdomen and one bullet in the right hand. The murderer saw that the purpose had been achieved and fled separately. After being wounded, Ma immediately ordered the driver to drive back to the residence. His family immediately called the Lujiawan French Police Station and immediately summoned an ambulance to rush the injured Ma and Xu to Guangci Hospital for treatment. At the same time, Chinese and foreign detectives were sent to the scene of the incident to investigate and look for bullet casings, and to investigate the reasons for Ma's victimization. Ma was very conscious after being injured and admitted to the hospital. According to his family, Ma originally intended to leave Shanghai for Hong Kong, but he was unable to make the trip due to miscellaneous matters, but he was unexpectedly subjected to this accident.</p>
<p>Xu Shen</p>
<p>A reporter for the current "Xin Shen Bao" was passing by the corner of Hongkou Hanbi Li Road and Miller Road at about 10:00 yesterday when suddenly a person jumped out from the side of the road and shot him. He was shot three times in the vital parts of his chest and abdomen, and he immediately fell to the ground, bleeding profusely and unconscious. When the street guards heard the sound and rushed to the scene, the shooter had disappeared. They immediately took him to Fumin Hospital for treatment. After the hospital performed surgery, the bullets were removed, but his life was still in critical condition. It is heard that Xu Shen's name is Jiqiao, a native of Jinshan, 35 years old. He used to work as a field worker for the Shibao, and later joined a major news agency. After leaving his job due to an incident, he joined the "Xin Shen Bao" for service due to the times after "August 13th." He also served as a counselor in the staff headquarters of the Central China Special Service Agency. He usually frequented the Huiquan Tea House on Fuzhou Road.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Japanese Side Implements Food Control and Blockade: Refugee Area Cut Off Food for Four Days: 20,000 Wretched People Driven to the Brink of Starvation: Resolved After Negotiations with the French Authorities <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The refugees accommodated in the refugee area in the south of the city numbered no less than 200,000 during the August 13th battle. After continuous repatriation, up to recently there were still 20,000 refugees accommodated. The food consumption of the refugees in the area reached 1,800 bags per month, and the Finance Committee of the refugee area directly signed a contract with the merchants, and the Japanese Military Police issued an "Import Permit" to transport the food for supply. Recently, because the Japanese side attempted to "prosper" the market and opened up the south of the city, Japanese commercial institutions moved in one after another. Then there was the "Rice Grain Company," which was a</p>
<p>Rice Control</p>
<p>The food consumption in the refugee area is quite large, but they cannot be controlled by it, and they have been coveting it for a long time. On the 17th of this month, after the expiration of the "Import Permit" for food in the refugee area, the Japanese side did not continue to issue it. On one side, they strongly demanded that the refugee area authorities accept the request for rice and grain control. The refugee area authorities have a contract with the merchants in the concession for the supply of rice and grain. The Japanese request is difficult to accept, so they refused. Therefore, the Japanese side</p>
<p>Blockade Food Input</p>
<p>As a result, 20,000 refugees in the refugee area, except for some of the elderly and weak who used thin porridge and boiled water to satisfy their hunger every day, most of them pawned their clothes, hats, and shoes for rice to maintain their lives. However, the income was very little, not enough for a full meal, and those who could not pawn anything had to cry and wail all day long. 20,000 wretched people were driven to the brink of starvation, and those who were cut off from food reached four days. The tragic situation cannot be imagined by those who wear silk and eat meat in the concession. The authorities in the refugee area, knowing that the situation was serious, knew that it would be ineffective to negotiate with the Japanese side alone, so they asked the French Concession authorities to</p>
<p>Strongly Negotiate</p>
<p>If the rice and grain were not released immediately, the iron gates of the French Concession would be closed. The Japanese side was eager to "prosper" the south of the city, so they had to accept it and issued the "Import Permit" immediately. On the 23rd of this month, 300 bags of rice and grain had been transported in, and 500 bags were transported in the day before yesterday, so the food cut-off panic in the refugee area in the south of the city was resolved.</p>

It will be broadcast jointly by the Central Broadcasting Station (call sign XGOA 1200 kilocycles) and the International Broadcasting Station (call sign XGOY 11900 kilocycles). All radio stations in the country will broadcast it simultaneously. Shanghai can also listen. However, it is found that 7:00 pm Eastern Time is equal to 8:00 pm Shanghai time.</p>

<p>The French Concession Price Equalization Committee was originally scheduled to hold its third congress yesterday, but at the committee meeting the day before yesterday, the members of the committee believed that, in order to gather ideas and benefit, it was necessary to wait until the report from the Police Department of the Public Concession arrived before the plenary meeting could make a second decision. Therefore, yesterday's congress temporarily announced the postponement. At the committee meeting the day before yesterday, someone proposed to hold two matters: (1) to adopt a "new system of weights and measures" in the French Concession; (2) to investigate the names of the responsible persons in various industries, and to order the responsible persons to report the rise and fall of market prices to the committee at any time.</p>

<p>The British China General Omnibus Company and Tram Company and the French Water and Electricity Company in this port used to issue copper, aluminum, and nickel metal tokens and various denominations of coins because of the lack of dime coins in the market and the difficulty of making change, in order to solve the difficulty of making change. Since the Bank of China issued one-cent and five-cent coin notes, the circulation amount has been quite large, which is enough to meet the needs. Therefore, in addition to trying to recall the previously issued tokens and coins as much as possible, each company will not print and issue them in the future.</p>

<p>Foreign newspaper reporters, because American Consul Gauss is about to leave Shanghai and return to his country, held a farewell banquet for him in the Gold Room of the American Club yesterday afternoon. This Saturday, more than 300 groups including the American Chamber of Commerce will jointly hold a banquet for Gauss at the Columbia Club at 6:30 pm. Commander Glassford of the American Yangtze River Fleet, Colonel Baker, and Judge Haimilk and his wife will all attend as guests, and the American Fourth Naval Band will play music to help the fun.</p>
<p>American University Alumni Association: Grand Dinner Party the Night Before Last</p>
<p>The Continental News reported that the American University Alumni Association held a dinner dance party at the American General Assembly Hall on the night of the 27th to say farewell to Gauss, the former American Consul General in Shanghai and the first American Minister to Australia. It was chaired by Shen Siliang, the president of the alumni association. About 300 members and guests attended. The guests included Gauss, Bowden, the Australian Trade Commissioner to China, Judge Haimilk and his wife, the American Naval Attaché Judge, Colonel Baker and his wife, the Commander of the US Fourth Battle Squadron, Rear Admiral Glassford and his wife, and Shi Zhaoji, the former Chinese Ambassador to the United States. During the banquet, Haimilk and Bowden gave farewell speeches, and former President Bassett presented Gauss with a gift on behalf of the members. The guests and hosts had a good time and dispersed when they were satisfied.</p>

<p>Wangjiangjing District, Jiaxing County, is the transportation center of the Jiaxing Line and the Canal. Since the National Army withdrew to the west and Jiaxing fell, Yang Andun and Gu Shengqi (graduated from the former Whampoa Military Academy) were ordered to organize the Fourth Squadron of the Jiaxing County National Corps. Surrounded by evil forces, he did not avoid dangers, defended his hometown, and urged and led the local area to be peaceful. However, because the northeast neighboring villages were plagued by banditry, and bandits disturbed several times a night, Captain Gu repeatedly decided to personally lead the team to suppress and arrest them, and they captured quite a lot. Therefore, these people held a grudge and plotted to harm him in every possible way. On the night of March 18, Captain Gu led the team out to patrol and encountered a large gang of bandits on the border of Chixi Township. After several hours of fierce fighting, he unfortunately died in action due to the disparity in strength. The bad news came out, and the people in the entire district mourned him.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Communications has submitted the matter of increasing domestic postage rates to the Legislative and Executive Yuan for approval. Therefore, this matter is actually a matter of time. It is obviously too late to implement it on April 1st. At the same time, the Postal Administration had not received the order to increase prices from the Kunming Postal Administration as of yesterday. Once domestic postage rates are increased, new stamps must be printed due to the different amounts on the stamps. It is now known that Hong Kong is printing them, and it is also known that before the new stamps are printed, the currently used stamps will be temporarily applied with an additional stamp. However, there is no definite news on the exact date of the price increase.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Candidates for Japanese Board Members Will be Elected Early Next Month. Reportedly Due to Unfinished Procedures. Reflecting Demands to Increase the Number of Japanese Directors. <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>According to Japanese sources, the election of Japanese candidates for the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) board, originally scheduled for yesterday (the 28th), has been postponed to early next month at the Japanese Club due to unfinished procedures. Previous reports mentioned the recommendation of two Japanese assistants by the Japanese Residents' Association to assist with the election, approved by the former Council. According to a reporter from the Ta Chung News Agency, after further inquiries, the two Japanese assistants are Takiguchi Masahide and Iwasaki Hideo, recommended by the Shanghai branch manager of Yokohama Specie Bank, Kishi Nami, and have been approved by election supervisor Mr. Brent and others. Takiguchi is currently an employee of the Yokohama Specie Bank branch and also serves as the acting branch manager. Iwasaki is currently the head of the dispatching section of the East Asia Shipping Company. Their duties in the election will be to assist the supervisors, while Mr. Brent and others will oversee the voting, guard the ballot boxes, and count the votes.</p>
<p>Japanese Demands to Increase Candidates</p>
<p>Regarding the Japanese demand to increase the number of candidates, British and American figures in the city have repeatedly expressed their opinions, believing that in the past history of the SMC, the Japanese have repeatedly attempted this, but never succeeded. They also believe that the power of the Japanese in Shanghai is difficult to rival that of the British and American communities. Some also believe that if Japanese taxpayers could cooperate with Chinese taxpayers, they might be able to obtain an absolute majority in the SMC and exclude British and American influence. However, this is currently impossible. It is generally speculated that this year's attempt by the Japanese will suffer the same fate. However, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy stated yesterday that the Japanese residents in Shanghai intend to nominate several more candidates for the upcoming SMC board election. The spokesman claimed that representatives from various Japanese organizations and the Japanese Residents' Association will soon hold a joint meeting to decide on the number of additional candidates to be nominated. The Japanese residents are currently working on investigating to determine the number of votes and the total number of Japanese taxpayers. Once this issue is resolved, the meeting will be held. The spokesman repeatedly emphasized that the Japanese side intends to increase the number of Japanese directors, pointing out that the number of Japanese residents in Shanghai has increased sharply in recent years, and therefore the number of Japanese taxpayers has also increased. The number of candidates to be nominated by the Japanese side is currently an important issue. If the Japanese continue to nominate two people as usual, the SMC board election seems unnecessary. However, judging from the spokesman's statement and recent rumors that the Japanese want to increase the number of Japanese directors, this year's SMC board election will be very fierce. The deadline for nominating candidates for the SMC board will be next Tuesday (April 2nd), so the Japanese have six days to decide everything. The election will be held on April 10th and 11th.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Rickshaw Drivers Request Increase in Alcohol Allowance, Negotiations Today, Both Parties Express Opinions, Attitudes are Very Sincere <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The drivers of the four major dispatch car companies in this city, Xiang Sheng, Taylor, Silver, and Yunfei, requested an increase in alcohol allowance from their employers. The drivers of these companies each sent four representatives on the 22nd of this month to negotiate with the employers, but no satisfactory solution was reached. Both parties immediately agreed to negotiate again this afternoon to find a solution.</p>
<p>Employer's Opinion</p>
<p>In the past week, the employers of each company have jointly studied the matter several times. The result is that each driver is allowed an increase of half a corner for rice subsidy per person. However, the labor side felt that this was a drop in the bucket and difficult to solve the problem, and finally did not accept it. According to the employers, if the drivers' request to increase the alcohol allowance is implemented, customers may not be willing to accept it, especially Western customers. In that case, the company would have to be responsible, and the loss would be too great, especially since Taylor Motor Company's customers are mostly foreigners, and according to foreign customs, this request is difficult to realize.</p>
<p>Labor's Difficulties</p>
<p>According to the labor side of a certain company among the four major motor companies, the hardships of the drivers are not known to outsiders. Taking the drivers of a certain company as an example, the highest salary is only nine corners per day (plus three corners for rice subsidy, totaling one yuan and two corners), and the lowest is only five corners per day (including eight corners for rice subsidy). Moreover, the company only has over a hundred vehicles, while there are over three hundred drivers. Therefore, each driver can only work an average of fifteen or sixteen days per month, earning only ten yuan or so per month. Adding the original alcohol allowance, it is only twenty or thirty yuan. It is difficult to provide for personal food and expenses with this limited salary, let alone a family burden. Furthermore, if they are slightly negligent and violate traffic rules, they will be fined three to five yuan by the police, all of which are borne by the drivers themselves. In addition, if the drivers accidentally damage the car, they are also liable for compensation. As for working hours, they are irregular for sleep and meals, and many people suffer from illness. Moreover, the company has raised the fare three times, while the labor side only receives a meager rice subsidy. The company's profits last year reached a huge sum of over 770,000 yuan. Our request is really not excessive, they said.</p>
<p>Driver's Attitude</p>
<p>The labor representatives of each company met yesterday afternoon at 3 pm to discuss everything. The result of the discussion was that the half a corner that the employer is willing to add for rice subsidy only amounts to two yuan or so per month for us (because the drivers can only work a dozen days or so per month on average). Our request is for alcohol allowance, not rice subsidy, so it is difficult to accept. Moreover, our request to increase the alcohol allowance can be abolished once prices fall. It does not seem to be inappropriate in terms of reason and emotion. As for the rumor that if the negotiations do not have satisfactory results, we will all strike, this is a misunderstanding. Since we made this request, we have all maintained a sincere attitude, knowing that it is absolutely impossible to easily strike and disrupt ourselves at this time and place. However, for the sake of maintaining a livelihood, we are also determined not to make excessive concessions. It is also learned that the labor and management will hold negotiations this afternoon, and the location may be in the Big World Ballroom. Each company will send four representatives to participate, it is said. It is also learned that both parties have a very sincere attitude, and the negotiations should be able to achieve a satisfactory solution.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Shanghai War Loss Compensation Case, Lawsuit for Over 20,000 US Dollars, China East Electric Company Sues American Insurance Company, The Key is Robbery Rather Than War Loss, American Consular Court Once Tried <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Continental News: The China East Electric Company, a Chinese-owned company at 959 Zhoujiazui Road, suffered major losses during the Shanghai War in 1937. However, the company had insured with the American Home Insurance Company, so it demanded compensation of US$27,000. However, the Home Insurance Company claimed that the China East Company's machines were robbed rather than damaged during the war, resulting in a lawsuit. The American Consular Court in China held a continued trial on the 27th. Peng Nat, the head of the Huishan Police Station during the Shanghai War, testified in court. He stated that in the second half of 1937, the Japanese army had engaged in "rampant looting" in the Huishan area. In September of that year, he personally witnessed Japanese naval infantry looting in the area, but did not see any Chinese looting. He never saw Japanese soldiers stop other Japanese soldiers from looting. Starting at the end of that year, the Japanese army systematically looted machinery and various steel items, accumulating three large piles in the Huishan area, he said. After the British Huake and other witnesses from the Shanghai Water Company testified, the court adjourned and scheduled a continued trial.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Agreement Reached on Allocation of Low-Priced Coal Dust, Sales to Begin Next Month, 100 Yuan Per Ton, Total of 1,000 Tons, Coal Ball Prices Should be Further Reduced <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Association held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 4 pm at the association hall at 59 Hong Kong Road, inviting representatives from various coal dust companies to allocate low-priced coal dust. Xu Jiqing and Yan E'sheng from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce were present, as well as You Chunxin and He Ziguo and other representatives from Yitaixing, Dalongxing, Hancheng, Tongcheng and other coal companies, and Chen Cuifang, chairman of the Coal Ball Industry Association. Xu Jiqing presided over the meeting. The chairman first read the minutes of the previous meeting, and then began allocating low-priced coal. Yitai was allocated 500 tons, Dalongxing 300 tons, Hancheng 100 tons, and Tongcheng 100 tons, totaling 1,000 tons. The flat price was 100 yuan per ton in national currency, allocated to 24 small coal ball factories, and it was decided to start sales on April 1st and end on April 10th. The meeting adjourned after the discussion. In addition, the Shanghai Cooked Water Industry Association voluntarily donated to refugee relief after obtaining low-priced coal dust this time, 10 yuan per household. Since the beginning, donations have been very enthusiastic. As of yesterday, around 1,000 yuan had been collected and dispatched to Yu Qiaqing of the Flat Price Committee, Yuan Fudeng of the Shanghai Refugee Children's Education Institute, and Huang Yanfang of the Refugee Relief Branch, 300 yuan each, totaling 900 yuan. However, the industry association is still urging members to continue to donate to continue sending to the above charitable organizations.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Puppet Market Coerces Local Goods Industry, No Results, Taxes and Commissions Layered Exploitation, South City Industry Always Firmly Refuses <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The "Central Market" held an opening ceremony on the 22nd of this month and decided to officially open for business on April 1st. Then it actively coerced local goods and other industries in the city to join, but the industries in various places in South City have always refused. The details are now divided as follows:</p>
<p>Extensive Control</p>
<p>According to a reporter's investigation, the control range of the "market" is very wide. The "market" reportedly plans to raise 5 million yuan in capital. If you join the "market", you must pay at least 500 yuan in capital. The size of the business depends on the amount of capital paid. If you don't pay, you can't do business in the "market".</p>
<p>Heavy Donations and Commissions</p>
<p>At present, the taxes and fees donated by local goods such as dried meat transported to Shanghai from various roads are already more than 60%. After the puppet "market" wants to implement control, it also collects a 10% commission on those who have already paid taxes. This commission is paid to the "Wholesalers Association" organized by the Japanese puppets. According to local goods industry sources, the Japanese can net 20% of this commission, and the rest is used as public funds for the "market".</p>
<p>Industry Firmly Refuses</p>
<p>The South City local goods industry, mainly fruits and dried meat, has been coerced by the Japanese puppets many times, but has not yet joined. The various industries there believe that if they join the "market" to do business, under the control of the Japanese puppets, they are afraid that not only will there be no profit to be made, but before joining, they must first pay a huge deposit. According to sources in the industry, the active figure in the 16th pier area is the owner of a certain local goods store that has now closed down.</p>

<p>Zhou Xisheng, a native of Changzhou who resides on Route Robert and currently runs the Zhou Xiji Plank Box Shop, had his only son, Wen Zhao (6 years old), kidnapped at 3:20 pm on the 10th of this month while accompanying his sister Jin Feng to study at the Life Elementary School at 1085 Gordon Road. The kidnappers were Xu Ronghu, a fellow townsman and former apprentice coppersmith at Zhou Xisheng's former shop in Zhabei, in collusion with Xu Genda (also a native of Changzhou and an apprentice coppersmith) who was at large, to lure Zhou's child.</p>
<p>Kidnapped Without a Trace</p>
<p>After Zhou Xisheng reported to the Putuo Road Police Station, the police dispatched detectives to arrest Xu Ronghu at the Tai Ji Coppersmith Shop at 120 Dagulu Road, brought him to the police station, and sent him to the First Branch Court, which was postponed. Zhou Xisheng received an anonymous letter delivered by the Changzhou Ben Niu Post Office, stating that if he wanted his son Wen Zhao back, he had to pay 50,000 yuan, which made him realize that Wen Zhao</p>
<p>Was Hidden in Changzhou</p>
<p>He entrusted relatives and friends to take the train to Changzhou to investigate the whereabouts of Zhou's child and learned that Wen Zhao was hidden in an empty house in the Lion Lane outside the North Gate. He reported the situation to the puppet police of the Water Patrol Team, who rescued Zhou Wen Zhao at the address, while Xu Genda had fled upon hearing the news. Only a young man named Xu Cai Di, who was guarding Zhou's child, was apprehended and taken to the Water Patrol Team for detention. Zhou's child was</p>
<p>Returned to Shanghai by Relatives</p>
<p>Yesterday, Judge Liu Yukui came to the Third Criminal Court to investigate the case. Qian Xunjiu, the lawyer for the police station, stated that although the defendants Xu Ronghu and Xu Genda, who were at large, were young, this method constituted kidnapping for ransom. The case should be adjourned again. Zhou's child then accompanied his father to court to prove that the defendant and Xu Genda gave him candy on the way and said they would take him</p>
<p>To See a Play Somewhere</p>
<p>They took a rickshaw to a train station, took a train to Changzhou, and hid him there, etc. When questioned, the defendant claimed that Xu Genda was the instigator and asked for leniency. Judge Liu ordered that he be remanded in custody for further verification.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Shanghai West Gambling Dens, Lingering On, Using Sex to Attract Gamblers, Fierce Infighting Between Two Gangs <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai West Bad Land gambling tax has a monthly income of 1.8 million yuan, so the puppet municipal government and a certain puppet organization once planned to seize it. It has been rumored for a long time that the Japanese side is unwilling to give up this income and still wants to continue to control it. Large gambling dens such as Hollywood, Zhao Feng, Yuyuan, Qiu, Monte Carlo, and their branch gambling dens in Caojiadu and other places, such as Da Sheng, are taking the opportunity to squeeze each other, so that some will close down and be able to concentrate profits. Therefore, the gambling dens of Guang Sheng and Da Xin were closed down and fled after Sun Shucheng was reported by Yang Abing. Xu Weijiang and others interrogated the accomplice Wang. Shao Lian of Rong Sheng Company also sold the gambling den and fled to Hong Kong, creating a confrontation between the Zhu and Gao gangs. Illegal things are endless, such as instigating gangsters to rob gamblers from other gambling dens, which happens almost every day. At the same time, the Yuyuan was bombed, and several gamblers died tragically. Zhao Feng also had a similar incident. Therefore, gamblers are afraid to move forward, and the doors can be used to catch sparrows. Now, because the Japanese puppets have ordered to use dance halls or entertainment and restaurants and tea rooms as a guise, they issue two licenses for entertainment venues and clubs. Therefore, gamblers use this as a smokescreen, advertising and luring gamblers to try to save the decline. Among them, Zhao Feng and others, who use dance halls as a guise, even use nude dancing to anesthetize the crowd, which is truly a strange phenomenon in the den of sin. There have been rumors of the closure of gambling dens in Shanghai West many times, but according to the reporter's personal investigation in the Western District, the so-called amusement park clubs and flower associations are still everywhere. Even the gambling stalls built with mat sheds still gather people to gamble. The saying of banning gambling is obviously empty talk.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Xu Qizhong and Sheng Meiying End Cohabitation Relationship, Sheng's Counterclaim for Compensation for Damages Rejected <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Xu Qizhong, the son of Zhejiang gentleman Xu Guannan, who was traveling in Shanghai, concluded with Sheng Meiying, a dancer in the Grand Shanghai Ballroom in the 20th year of the Republic of China. Then he was tempted by her and instigated by bad friends. In the following year, he rented a house to live with her. However, Sheng was born in a dance hall and was extravagant by nature. Her daily life was extremely luxurious. In a few years, Xu Qizhong</p>
<p>Exhausted his efforts to supply her, spending as much as 100,000 yuan, resulting in heavy debts that he was unable to repay. He finally declared bankruptcy in the winter of the 24th year of the Republic of China. Since then, it was not easy to live in Shanghai, so he moved his family to Suzhou to reduce expenses, and Sheng also went with him, renting a house to live separately. In the middle, Sheng had left Suzhou once in a fit of anger because she could not get what she wanted, but soon quietly returned. Xu Qizhong compromised. At that time, the feelings between the two were still not bad. When the war broke out, Xu led his family to Shanghai via Suzhou, who had survived the robbery. The economy was extremely difficult, and all expenses could not fully satisfy Sheng's intention. Sheng Jianyu's golden age has passed</p>
<p>Unable to deal with it, she took advantage of people's unpreparedness and rolled away her clothes and decorations at dawn on April 6th last year and never returned. In addition to asking a lawyer to send a letter to Xu demanding huge sums of money, she also published huge warning notices in various newspapers in Shanghai, and applied to Xu for reconciliation and payment of living expenses to the Special First Court, and filed a criminal lawsuit for abandonment, which had already been ruled that Xu Qizhong was innocent. Xu decided that he could not persuade her to return to continue living together, knowing that she could not live in poverty and wanted to leave. If she was left outside, it would not be a good idea after a long time. So he hired lawyers Lu Shaozong and Shen E to file a lawsuit against Sheng to</p>
<p>End Cohabitation</p>
<p>Relationship, At first, when the two were living together, they signed a cohabitation contract, which stated that if either party wanted to terminate the cohabitation, they had to compensate the other party for damages of 10,000 yuan. To this end, Sheng also filed a counterclaim, demanding Xu Qizhong to pay 10,000 yuan. The case has been tried and concluded by Judge Xu Fuji, and the verdict was given a few days ago to allow the two parties to end their cohabitation relationship, and Sheng Meiying's counterclaim for payment of 10,000 yuan was dismissed.</p>

<p>Workers at the Fuxin Flour Factory on Dasulu West Suzhou Road in the Public Concession were previously contracted by foreman Yu Qingzhi (36 years old). Now, Yu has left his job due to an incident, and new foreman Xue Yougui has taken over. At around 10 am yesterday, Xu led more than 100 new workers to take over. At that time, the old workers used by Xue were unwilling to lose their jobs once and blocked the new workers from entering the factory. The two sides then clashed. The workers on both sides had weapons such as iron rods. For a time, they were twisted and fought in a group, and many people were injured. Then, Huapu No. 1515, No. 515, and No. 480 heard the police and arrived. Because there were many workers, they were unable to persuade them. In order to maintain order, they fired shots into the sky as a warning. However, at that time, a stray bullet hit Gao Jinsheng (22 years old), a native of Jiangbei, in the right leg, and he fell to the ground injured. At the same time, 13 workers were injured, including Guo Wenzi, 53 years old, seriously injured in the head, He Erhui, 32 years old, Qiao Laosha, 63 years old, Lu Wenzhang, 22 years old, Li Shouru, 33 years old, Yao Deyang, 36 years old, Yan Baosheng, 32 years old, Pan Yixiu, 43 years old, Zhang Ziyuan, 60 years old, Zhang Achen, 32 years old, Shi Abing, 27 years old, Zhang Renqing, 25 years old, Liu Baosheng, 28 years old, each had injuries. Afterwards, they were all sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Lei You of the Shang Song Fen Tang Pharmacy recently found that someone on the market was counterfeiting the Liu Shen Wan produced by the pharmacy, and the Jin Chang Watch Shop on Simalu publicly published advertisements to sell them at low prices. They started an investigation and sent someone to buy several boxes from Jin Chang. Upon inspection, they were indeed counterfeit. They reported to the Old Ah Police Station, which dispatched detectives to arrest Zhou Xianggen, Hua Guanqing, Wang Jingxin, Wu Shanfa, Wang Minsheng, and Ye Ziqing, among others, and copied out a large number of Liu Shen Wan. They brought them to the police station and sent them to the First Special Court for interrogation. The day before yesterday, Fang Justice of the Peace continued the trial of the case in the Fourth Criminal Court. Chiang Baolien, the lawyer for the police station, filed a lawsuit according to law, and the Shang Song Fen Tang Pharmacy hired Fan Gang and Yu Enliang as lawyers to attend the court to bring incidental civil lawsuits, requesting that the defendants be jointly and severally liable for compensation for losses of 21,300 yuan in national currency. Questioning the defendants, they jointly hired lawyers Wang Yaotang and Qian Yuzhong to defend them in court. After Fang Justice of the Peace inquired clearly, he sentenced Zhou Xianggen and Hua Guanqing to not guilty, Wang Jingxin and Wu Shanfa each to a fine of 100 yuan, Wang Minsheng to a fine of 200 yuan, and Ye Ziqing to a fine of 300 yuan, and compensated the victim for losses of 600 yuan, and the counterfeit Liu Shen Wan was confiscated.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Youth Association recognizes that deaf-mute compatriots are also members of the country. Although they are congenitally deficient, deaf in the ear and mute in the mouth, many of them are intelligent and talented, and some are even better than ordinary people. Last month, the association established a deaf-mute society to teach them knowledge of morality, intelligence, physical education, and group education, which has been quite effective. Now, in order to promote deaf-mute art, it has been decided to hold a deaf-mute art exhibition at the association's second floor in Baxianqiao from the 29th, 30th, and 31st of this month, from 1 pm to 7 pm every day. It has collected deaf-mute works from all over Shanghai, various handicrafts, patterns, posters, photographs, embroidery, seals, sculptures, plaster models, and other items, totaling over 1,000 pieces, which are displayed among them. In addition, there are performance programs, on-site painting, and Q&amp;A with guests.

<p>Zhu Gaoji, who entered French nationality, was sent to the Consulate for interrogation. Lu Guanfu, Wang Enhan, and Jiang Xian, new detectives from the former French police station, extorted 5,000 yuan from Wang Yaokun, the owner of the sesame oil workshop at 78 Xiaodongmen Street, on the grounds of searching for opium on the morning of the 11th of last month, together with accomplices Zhu Gaoji, Wang Kunde, and Gao Haogen. Wang only paid out 600 yuan as a reward. Lu and others continued to negotiate because the numbers were too far apart. Wang immediately telegraphed the police station to report the situation. The police dispatched detectives to arrest Lu and others and send them to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court for trial. Zhang Minsheng Justice of the Peace presided over the trial. The police prosecuted each defendant for the crime of intimidation and fraud, but the fourth defendant, Zhu Gaoji, had entered French nationality and was transferred to the French Consulate for interrogation. The case was concluded yesterday morning. The main text was that Lu Guanfu, Wang Enhan, Jiang Xian, and Wang Kunde jointly intended to illegally possess themselves, intimidating others to deliver goods, and each was sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Gao Haogen helped to intimidate and defraud, and was sentenced to three months of imprisonment. All defendants were remanded to the detention center.</p>

<p>(From the Shun Pao, Twelfth Year of the Tongzhi Reign of the Dismembered Qing Dynasty)</p>
<p>Official Selection</p>
<p>The methods of selecting officials in ancient and modern times differ, and the paths to becoming officials also vary. From the era of Emperors Yao and Shun to the Ming Dynasty, a comprehensive review reveals the details. When a wise ruler is in power, the selection of officials is a collective endeavor; when a mediocre ruler is in power, it is a matter solely determined by the ruler; and when a foolish ruler is in power, officials seek their own advancement. When even generals seek their own positions, the state is inevitably headed for ruin. How can we say it's a collective endeavor? Observe Yao's selection of Shun and Shun's selection of Yu. Initially, they consulted the Four Mountains; then, based on the unanimous recommendations of the Four Mountains, they finally placed them in the court. Later, the selection of officials during the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties followed similar patterns. The reason why the reigns of the Three Emperors and Five Kings surpassed all others was undoubtedly due to their ability to select officials effectively. How can we say it's a matter solely determined by the ruler? The system of the Han dynasty did not emulate the emperors and kings but only followed the example of Qin Shi Huang. The ruler became increasingly exalted, while the ministers became increasingly humble. In governance, they constantly emphasized the sole control of authority; in selecting officials, they constantly emphasized that appointments came solely from above, showing a disdain for treating rulers and ministers as equals. However, there were occasional exceptions, such as Emperor Wu of Han's appointment of Ji Changru and Emperor Taizong of Tang's appointment of Wei Wenzhen. Although they often dared to speak frankly and directly point out his faults, Emperor Wu of Han was still able to tolerate it, not seeing him without formal attire. Emperor Taizong, however, was merely seeking fame and praise, and he often endured Wei Wenzhen's blunt advice, returning to the palace with resentment, saying, "I must kill this country bumpkin to vent my hatred." If not for Wei Wenzhen's loyalty and Empress Zhangsun's admonitions, it would have been difficult to maintain consistency. As for others, they were promoted when pleased and demoted when angered, not selecting the worthy for the sake of the state but merely dispensing personal favors. Yet, Emperor Wu was able to entrust Huo Guang with the care of Emperor Zhao to assist him, while Emperor Taizong instead gave his final instructions to Gao Hanyu to elevate the Li clan. Their superiority or inferiority is self-evident. These two emperors were known as wise rulers of the Han and Tang dynasties, yet they acted in this way. How much more could we expect from those even less capable than them? Their selection of officials is even more readily apparent.</p>

<p>Shanghai is a mixed community with both good and bad people. With the high cost of living these days, various scams and shady dealings are unfolding almost daily. A slight lapse in vigilance can easily lead to significant losses. However, upon investigation, every scam has its own "opportunity." The following two submissions illustrate this point. One involves a thief who, under the guise of repairing water pipes, stole a radio. The scammer obviously knew about the festive occasion beforehand, and the fact that Shanghai residents "each sweep the snow from their own doorstep" provided him with the opportunity to act. The second involves the lure of cheapness. Isn't there a free government-run smallpox vaccination clinic? Yet people tend to trust a "stranger" who comes to their door (as a "special envoy"), and, after a bunch of nonsense, are swindled out of fifteen dollars. Therefore, residents should help and look out for each other. If everyone is indifferent and allows a repairman to roam around the house unescorted, even if he really is sent by the landlord, a "grab-and-run" situation is likely to occur (as has happened in the newspapers). And one should be even more cautious of a "stranger" who talks about "completely free service." (Editor)</p>

<p>The day before yesterday, as I returned home in the evening and stepped onto the stairs, I already heard a barrage of complaints. Upon meeting Sister T, she told me disappointedly, "Bad luck! I was swindled out of fifteen dollars!" Indeed, this was the first time our family had been scammed.</p>
<p>The fact is this: Around three o'clock that afternoon, Sister T took fifteen dollars to buy something. As she ran downstairs, a stranger, a middle-aged man in his thirties wearing an old suit and overcoat, with a local accent, carrying a leather bag, barged into the landlord's house and said, "I am a special envoy from XX Hospital. Our hospital is entirely dedicated to charity. Tomorrow morning at nine o'clock, we will be providing free smallpox vaccinations at the intersection of Ganshi East Road (very close to my home). You must all go to get vaccinated! But those with dampness in their bodies cannot be vaccinated." Then he sat down and added, "If you encounter poor people who are sick, please send them to the hospital for treatment. 'We will not charge a single cent.'" After speaking, he left a note: "Zhao Zikun, No. 12, XX Hospital, across from the Great World." He also said that he would treat illnesses, "completely free of charge." However, those whom he cured were to give him a plaque to make him famous and to get him a ten-dollar raise at the hospital. In this way, no one would suspect that he was a swindler.</p>
<p>So the landlord was the first to ask him to examine her. When he got to the fifth person, Sister T's son, who is only six years old and has a skin condition, he said to Sister T, "This child will not be healthy until the dampness is removed. If I treat him, I guarantee he will gain weight. Let me examine him first and then prescribe medicine. However, you live upstairs. Since he has to take off his clothes, he will catch a cold here." Sister T honestly replied, "Upstairs." "That's great. Let's go upstairs to take a look." So everyone went upstairs. Sister T took off her son's outer garment and held him in her arms. There was no one else upstairs. He took out a copper cylinder about an inch in diameter and three inches long from his bag and placed it on the child's navel. Attached to the cylinder was a three-foot-long rubber tube, which he used like a suction pump. "There is electricity in here!" he said, spouting such nonsense. After a moment, he took off the cylinder, and there was some snot-like fluid inside, which he claimed was extracted from the body. Therefore, the navel needed to be bandaged immediately with medicine, which cost three to four dollars per bottle! About fifteen dollars in total. After buying it, vinegar had to be added and boiled together. He asked Sister T, "Are you literate?" "Yes." "What about English?" "I don't understand." "Then let me</p>

<p>— Wenying</p>
<p>What day is it today? Martyrs' Day. Twenty-nine years ago today, the martyrs, with their spirit of sacrifice, paid the price for freedom, creating this glorious page in history—to overthrow the Qing dynasty and liberate the people from tyranny.</p>
<p>But what about now? The darkness has exceeded that time by tens of millions of times. Oppression, humiliation, and slaughter are all intensified upon every compatriot in this place and at this time. We have lost freedom of body and mind, lost all guarantees, and are surrounded by serious threats. This darkness has brought us to an unbearable point. Therefore, today, in addition to sincere commemoration, we must continue the spirit of the martyrs, unleash everyone's strength, look at the current environment, and think about what we can do.</p>
<p>If we cannot continue the spirit of sacrifice of the martyrs, fighting for the country and the nation, and can only engage in a kind of ritualistic commemoration, then it is a disgrace to those who live on!</p>
<p>write an English medicine name for you!" As he spoke, he took the paper packet containing about fifteen dollars from Sister T's hand and wrote a few English words on it. Then he took out a plaster from his bag and said to Sister T, "Recite the method I just taught you for adding vinegar and boiling the medicine." After she recited it as he had instructed, he said, "No, someone once got my method wrong, and as a result, they ruined more than ten dollars' worth of Western medicine. Besides, the pharmacies now sell all their old stock to customers, the potency is insufficient, and the price is too high. I'm afraid you'll ruin the medicine, which would be a pity. So I'm willing to sell you medicine that I've already prepared and boiled at an 80% discount." Then he took out two bottles of so-called medicine powder from his bag, poured it on the plaster, and, strangely enough, the wallet disappeared without anyone knowing. He put the plaster on the child's navel and said, "Take good care of him, and he will be fine in twenty-four hours. I'll come again next week." After speaking, he packed up his belongings and left in a hurry.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Repairing Water Pipes <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Guangzhao</p>
<p>On the third of this month, a day with light rain, it was a roommate's wedding day. Around ten o'clock, a young man wearing a blue work uniform, holding pliers and all the necessary plumbing parts, came to the door and said that the landlord had sent him to repair the water pipes. The cleaning lady in the kitchen thought that was right, as the water pipes in the toilet room were not very smooth, so she let him come upstairs. The people upstairs thought he was sent by the landlord and didn't pay attention to him. After going up and down more than ten times, people thought he was looking at the water pipes, but in fact, he was examining the items in each room. Around twelve o'clock, he said to the cleaning lady, "I'll come back to repair it in the afternoon." Around two o'clock, he came again. By that time, it was time for the wedding, and many people had gone to watch the ceremony. There was only one cleaning lady watching the house. The repairman went up and down again, just like in the morning. He suddenly said to the cleaning lady, "This water pipe can't be repaired without your radio upstairs." In fact, the radio and the water pipe were completely unrelated. Because the cleaning lady didn't understand, he had the opportunity to steal the radio. He said directly to the cleaning lady, "Let me take the radio down to fix it, so the water pipe can be repaired." The ignorant cleaning lady believed him and watched him take the radio down. After waiting for more than half an hour, he didn't come back, and the cleaning lady became anxious. She went down to check, but where could she check? The clever thief had probably already sold the item.</p>

<p>— Xun</p>
<p>In recent days, many large apples and black dates have arrived in the market. Vendors are shouting and selling them on the side of the road, with baskets and bags full.</p>
<p>Apples are two for a dime, and black dates are five cents a bag, two dimes per pound. These prices are indeed extremely cheap in Shanghai, but please do not be tempted by this cheapness and do not be deceived by their lies. The apples are not from India but from Korea, and the black dates are not from Fujian but from Taiwan. Everyone should recognize this clearly.</p>

<h3 id="e126">A Sentence on the Cross <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>We believe that the words spoken by Jesus on the cross have been preserved to this day. Those present at the scene included John, a man of deep love and keen ears. There were three Marys: Jesus' mother, the wife of Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene. They loved Jesus and naturally paid close attention to what he did. There were also many other women, as well as other disciples. According to Mark's account, there were also many people mocking Jesus. Although their spirits differed from the disciples, they also took note of Jesus' words. Thus, we can believe that everything Jesus said on the cross has been passed down to us. The seven sentences on the cross encompass everything. Among the seven sentences, Matthew recorded one, Luke recorded three, and John recorded three. These seven sentences represent the seven key points of Christ's personality and work. The first sentence is about forgiveness: "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." The second sentence is about salvation: "Today you will be with me in paradise." This was said to the repentant thief. The third sentence is about love: "Woman, behold your son… Behold your mother." The fourth sentence is about atonement: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" This shows what sin is and the pain that Christ suffered for atoning for humanity's sins. The fifth sentence is about physical suffering: "I am thirsty." The sixth sentence is about victory: "It is finished." Some believe that these two words "It is finished" are the greatest words, as no one but Jesus could have uttered them. Because Jesus' personality was complete, flawless, and without blemish, he dared to say "It is finished." The last sentence is about reunion: "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit." The thought of the Heavenly Father permeated Jesus' entire life, so naturally, at this moment, he would completely trust in returning to the Heavenly Father. Now, let us temporarily set aside the other six sentences and discuss the first one: "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." What significance does this sentence of forgiveness have for us, who are poor, weak, sinful, and full of sins? What significance does it have for this sin-filled world? An old man said that Jesus' teachings cannot stand because they are built on a cross, on the death of the leader, on a great disaster. How can it stand? Little does he know that the reason why Jesus' teachings have been spreading wider and wider for thousands of years is precisely because of this. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Chapter 22: News Reports Fly in from Afar, Noble Discussions and Great Theories Are the Beliefs of Mankind</p>
<p>He Liyu said, "Sister Huihua! Look at every desk in this editorial office; there is a telephone. I think if all these telephones started talking at the same time, this editorial office would be very lively." Shao Huihua laughed and said, "That is an idealized imagination. How can there be telephones all talking at the same time? You are thinking of the direct-line telephones in foreign exchanges and banks, but those are overwhelmed from all directions. Here on the top floor, there is a wireless telegraph room, which receives all the important domestic telegrams. These telegrams are translated and sent down to the editorial department. As for the telephones on each person's desk, they are for special use. For example, in international affairs, if private individuals know something before the official documents are released, they can call the editorial department directly. Or if something is widely rumored but not actually accurate, they can explain the truth to the editorial department and tell us everything over the phone. Now that long-distance telephone services are available everywhere in China, if there is any important news in the country, our correspondents can make a long-distance call to the newspaper. China's transportation authorities also give special preference and assistance to the news industry, hoping that information will be especially fast. As for the local news department, if there is any news after midnight, it all depends on telephone reports. That's why the desks in the local news editorial department have so many telephones." Wu Junsu said, "Any news after midnight? For us, we go to bed at ten o'clock at the latest. In school, the lights are turned off at nine o'clock because everyone has to get up at six o'clock tomorrow. At twelve o'clock, we are already in deep sleep." Shao Huihua laughed and said, "Can the things in a newspaper office be compared to the things in your school? Needless to say, many international telegrams arrive in the middle of the night. Because the earth is rotating, the time is different in different places. Our night is daytime in the United States. Your school turns off the lights at nine o'clock, but people in the United States are still working. So if you want a piece of news that happens during the day in America to reach China immediately, wouldn't it already be in the middle of the night? As for local news! Shanghai is such a big city that it certainly has a night market, and the night market is also very late. Now, entertainment venues are already regulated and not allowed to stay open all night, but there are also people who work at night. For example, our newspaper office is a night job. Other factories are also working at night to rush orders. You say there is no news after twelve o'clock? You have to know that society is like a big machine, constantly moving day and night, and wherever there is movement, there is news. Besides, there are still three hours from twelve o'clock to three o'clock when the plates are made."</p>

<p>— Jia</p>
<p>Ernst Lubitsch has always admired Greta Garbo. After directing her in "Ninotchka," his understanding of her deepened. Here is what he said to people during filming:</p>
<p>"Since I started my directing career, I have had a lot of contact with movie stars. Each person has their own characteristics. For example, Miss Garbo has a characteristic: she doesn't like to work after five o'clock in the afternoon. However, she can start filming at nine o'clock in the morning without any haste. Because her performance is very skilled, she proceeds very smoothly with her work. Miss Garbo is so punctual that you can treat her like a clock."</p>
<p>"I think Miss Garbo is one of the quietest women I know. The quietest man in Hollywood is Gary Cooper. These two people never reveal their emotions. If you asked them to stand in front of a crowd and give a speech, it would be impossible."</p>
<p>"Generally, female stars apply a lot of powder during breaks in filming and spend a lot of time doing so, but Miss Garbo is different. Unless I tell her to, she never likes to look at her beautiful face in the mirror."</p>
<p>"The thing Miss Garbo dislikes the most is being rushed, so she doesn't like to work after five o'clock. The time after five o'clock is entirely her own."</p>
<h3 id="e129">Roadside Willow and Wallflower: A Discourse on the Way of Husband and Wife, Worthy of Your Consideration <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>I remember seeing a movie starring Hu Die called "Roadside Willow and Wallflower." At the time, I didn't have much of a feeling about it. A few days ago, after reading Mr. Neichang's "Happy Family," I couldn't help but think of the issue of roadside willow and wallflower. I agree with Mr. Neichang's statement that so-called happy families under the old ethics are bitter water wrapped in sugar. Why is this so? Because in the old ethics, the husband's responsibility to the wife is to provide for her, and the wife's responsibility to the husband is to bear children. Think about how unequal and unreasonable this principle is. Whether or not a wife can bear children is not entirely her responsibility. Either the husband cannot have children, or there is a physiological incompatibility between the two. Does the blame always fall on the wife? It is unreasonable to blame the wife for something that is not her fault. Conversely, it is also a great fallacy to consider that the wife has fulfilled her responsibilities simply by giving birth, which is natural and not solely her effort. Therefore, the wife's responsibility to the husband is not childbirth, and the husband's responsibility to the wife is not just providing for her. The responsibility that both should fulfill towards each other is comfort; comfort in body and mind, and consolation of emotions. After work, everyone needs to be comforted. When the husband's income is sufficient to cover the family's expenses, the wife should manage the household affairs in an orderly, clean, simple, and frugal manner, without unnecessary waste, and save a little when there is a surplus, finding some proper entertainment. If the husband's income is insufficient to cover necessary expenses, the wife should help earn some money, and both should share the obligations of the family. On which side? When the wife is tired from managing the household, the husband should take her out to play, tell her interesting stories, or jointly study an art that interests them. I believe that the union of husband and wife does not depend on whether it is new or old. The maintenance of love depends on only two conditions: one is to provide for the other's needs, and the other is to be considerate of the other's emotions. The beautiful story of Liang Hong and Meng Guang raising their trays to their eyebrows was not because Liang Hong was rich and powerful or because Meng Guang was beautiful and enchanting. Therefore, even in a free marriage, if the union is based on one party's money and the other party's beauty, there will still be no good outcome.</p>

<p>— Jing</p>
<p>Gengxin's female performer Xin Yanqiu, Yu Zhenfei, and others performed until the 31st, when their term expired. The roles will be taken over by Huang Guiqiu, Ma Junwu, Zhou Weijun, Bai Qingxiang, and others. They arrived in Shanghai on the Shenjing ship two days ago. Gengxin sent staff to the dock to welcome them. Guiqiu's arrival in Shanghai is a return to a familiar place. She is staying at her friend Wang Yunsun's home. Weijun is temporarily staying at the Yangtze Hotel. Junwu, to facilitate practice, is staying with Bai Qingxiang in the backstage dormitory. That evening, the theater hosted a welcome dinner for them at Yuebin Restaurant, which is also a customary reception banquet.</p>
<p>Previously, Guiqiu traveled from Hankou to Shanghai to perform at the Tianchan Theater. After her term expired, she returned to Beijing. She has been away from Shanghai for ten months. This time, she is back, and her style is still the same. She is a direct descendant of Chen Delin, and her singing has a unique style. She also has considerable research in painting. One of her masterpieces, "Butterfly Matchmaker," features an on-stage butterfly painting performance. Many female performers are her disciples, including Wang Xichun on Xiaodao Island in Hong Kong, Jin Suwen in Carlton, and Zheng Bingru. Guiqiu's three opening acts have been scheduled as "Butterfly Matchmaker," "Si Lang Visits His Mother," and "Wang Baochuan," starting on the first of next month.</p>
<p>Ma Junwu is the son of Ma Chunqiao and the nephew of Ma Lianliang. He is one of the young and vigorous martial performers, and his style is completely different from Liang Huichao's. In the summer of the year before last, he came south with Lianliang in the same troupe and performed at the Golden Grand Theater. The audience has a considerable understanding of him. Zhou Weijun, the young male performer, was also one of the first members invited by Gengxin to come south. He has partnered with Wu Suqiu, Zhao Jinrong, Liang Yunqiu, Zheng Bingru, and others. His teacher is Jin Zhongren, who is as famous as Wang Yurong. Zhongren highly praises this beloved disciple and has said, "His performance of 'The Eight Great Hammers' is unparalleled in Beijing." This time, he may have the opportunity to show it off in Shanghai.</p>

<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The news of Gu Eryi's death seemed to be absolutely certain. The Lafayette Theater even held a morning performance of "Parasitic Grass" the week before last to raise money for Gu Eryi's family.</p>
<p>However, we recently received a letter from a friend in Chongqing stating that Gu Eryi, along with Bai Yang, Zhang Youping, Wei Heling, Shi Chao, and others, performed Yang Hansheng's play "Beyond the Great Wall" directed by Shen Xiling at the Chongqing Guotai Grand Theater on March 17th.</p>
<p>Although transportation between Chongqing and Shanghai is inconvenient, news about movies and dramas is often exchanged in personal letters. Yet, the "news of death" of Gu Eryi was spread so bizarrely, and even verified by the Gu family in Nantong! This is truly a strange piece of news.</p>
<p>Now it is definitely proven that Gu Eryi is not dead, which can be a comfort to his friends and audiences.</p>

<p>Old Tan's Extraordinary Cleverness (Part 2)</p>
<p>After the performance that day, according to custom, he should wait for the Emperor and Empress to grant gold and silver pellets and other rewards. However, due to a mistake of one word, Wei was not full, and they did not meet. Tan did not mind it slightly. He hurriedly returned to his residence after removing his makeup. His companions knew that Tan's temperament was eccentric, and no one dared to question him afterward. There was a certain actor from Shanghai who had a close friendship with Tan. After arriving in Beijing, he stayed at Tan's house. Driven by curiosity, the actor had discussed with Tan that day, asking to be dressed as a servant to accompany Tan into the palace to observe the scenery inside the forbidden area. Tan recited the four words "kill the pig, slaughter the cow." The actor heard them clearly. In the evening, when no one was around, he lay down next to the couch and privately asked Old Tan, "What happened to you today, sir? Why did you recite 'slaughter the cow' instead of 'slaughter the sheep'?" After listening, Old Tan only smiled and continued to play the flute. When he finished in one breath, he jumped up from the couch and gestured with his hand, saying, "Killing one sheep is enough to lose one's head! Moreover, this year is 'Three Sheep (Yang) Bring Prosperity.' I originally didn't want to sing this play, but the playbill added 'Catch and Release.' If I had recited the original words today, I would have committed a great act of disrespect. If someone pointed it out and explained it to the chief eunuch, would I still have my head?" After listening attentively, the actor realized that the Empress Dowager Cixi and Li Lianying were both born in the year of the sheep. This year happened to be the year of the sheep, hence the saying "Three Sheep Bring Prosperity." The next day, the actor told the others, and someone who wanted to curry favor with Li relayed Tan's words. Li was pleased with Tan's carefulness and alertness and praised him greatly before the Empress, doubling the rewards. Later, the actor returned to the south and constantly warned his peers, saying, "After all, the Beijing actors have received training. They often learn from scholars. Not to mention their study of words, they even know these taboos. They are afraid of violating the holy name. Compared to those who spout nonsense on stage, they are many times better." It is said that after this, the eunuchs managing the Southern Mansion in the inner court never again put "Catch and Release" on the playbill. Tan the Great King's extraordinary skills are enough to amaze people, and his extraordinary wisdom is also the greatest reason for his fame.</p>
