<h3 id="c6">歐局演變中的遠東萌動 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>英法聯軍苦戰無功，巴黎終於不守，這是日來最動人心魄的一慕重大演變；此其意義，也許只有中世紀君士坦丁堡的陷落差堪比擬。然而在人類理性與智能都有空前發展的今日、不見得武力即是無上權威！往昔君士坦丁堡的陷落，使繼承希臘傳統的東歐文明，有全歸澌滅之觀；但這一次巴黎的不守，却決非民治文明的落沒。當然，經此一度挫敗，使此後的撥亂反正，感受十百倍的艱難；而全世界愛好自由。愛好民治的人們亦必感受十百倍的重任，不堪回首吧，由良知判斷而又恨又悔！然有悔恨之餘，惟有睿智和勇毅的人們。能史堅決，更奮發，來應付當前相今後的艱鉅。不但應付，不但如此志願，深信若非宇宙瞬息毀滅，則重見光明，必然的期不在遠。</p>
<p>美國是安定世變的主要因素，有其觀察世變的冷靜理智；故於其注視歐局的同時，能切實注視遠東大局的動盪；數日來，總統羅斯福氏與國務卿赫爾氏的鄭　聲明，正是他們理智的表示，亦是民治文明決不落沒的保證。沒有更顯明的對照了：在這歐局演變的數日之中，日本所謂革新分子，湊着歐局演變而大見活躍。高唱其加入德義同盟厲行南進政策的老調。他們鑒於侵略所遭遇中國的抗戰，無殊於天譴，乃分頭從事於軍事與和平兩陣的對華攻勢；多方發放無聊而沒人置信的和牛讕言，更驅其日暮途遠，氣衰力竭的隊伍，偷襲了德國新戰峪的皮毛，在華中腹地發動游攻，用飛機濫炸中國後方城市，初不以美國的道義禁運和抗議譴責而稍見斂跡，反而變本加厲，竟要求第三國僑民撒離重慶。這在列強方面，有如英日天津懸案　解決，若干美國政客主張遷就日本的論調，無疑的都是日本最近這種姿態所引起的感應。吾人絕不訝異，深知國際局墊混亂至此，無論交戰國或非交戰國。處境各自有其困難。應付歐局已小免顧此失彼。則事關遠東方面的，自不必求全責備。所不能不明白提示者；遷就現寶。自有其不可逾越的限度，而反抗侵略的鐵則。尤必適應於歐西遠東而皆迪。鐵則之下，無可取巧；但觀於二三年來。英法之於拆散德義軸心，費過不少苦心。也付出過重大代價，結果依然不能阻遏義大利的參加歐戰；這是鐵則之下，鐵一般的事實，鐵一般的教訓；歐西遠東，同此事理，</p>
<p>日本對中國所取攻勢，未見中國有何憂懼，而中國所作簡明而堅決的答復，只是實力抗戰。吾們所欲再加說明者，遠東國際局勢，亦甚複雜。目前各種方式的動盪。還在繼續發展之中；是所望於有關各國的當局，體認下列三項基調：</p>
<p>第一，遠東局勢安危實繫於中國的抗戰；歐戰鑤發至今九個月，日本野心縱極張熾，行動上則始終小敢冒險輕動；這絕小是列強綏靖政策的功績，也不是日本對列强的善意使然，主要還是由於日本的最大部分實力都被中國牽掣了，以致無法轉側。最近日方對華之濫取攻勢，肆行轟炸，雖有其內在的政治理由，然亦足見其亟求結束戰事的焦急。中國抗戰愈堅定愈有力，則日本向別方面擴展的可能愈微小。換句話說，也就是中國的抗戰與列强的遠東權益之間，確具聯帶的利害關係。那種準備對日略事讓步俾換取其善意中立的主張，其實是昧於遠東大勢；如果把所準備可以讓予日本的利益轉而用以援助中國，倒眞能收穫安定遠東的實效。</p>
<p>第二，日本一般革新分子的口號，是加入德義同盟，協約國之不惜與日本委蛇，也是為了防止日本對德義沆瀣一氣；殊不知如果德國確有求助日本的必要，則去歲德國在對蘇聯妥協之前。必同時先行取得義大利與日本兩國之諒解，日本決不會獨遭凄涼的遺棄。當時日本的軍事使節已在中途，却因蘇德不侵協定成立，嗒然喪氣而返。足見德方已看透日本的精力耗竭已不足為用。最近歐戰達嚴重階段，一部分日本人縱極囂狂，德方態度则轉趨冷淡，並沒有歡迎日本加入自方陣綫的醞釀；日方的種楝呼聲，也不過徒為威脅協约国的一種姿態而已。</p>
<p>第三，應付侵略者只有運用實力當機立斷，纔能收穫功效；例行抗議，空言譴责，不過貽誤事機，絕非蓄意侵略者所措意。赫爾對轟炸重慶的責難，日方竟以要求僑民撤離相要挾；而禁止機器出口的措置，則日本立即感到壓迫，並從外交上從事疏解，這可以證明如何纔是有效的辦法。何況凡屬侵略者大都乘人不備，爆發事端，是故對方警覺和準備都不充分，必　倉皇無以應付；此度歐戰，協的國已因此吃虧不淺。遠東現勢的維護，勢非列强增加可供運用的實力，並確保主動地位不可。</p>

<h3 id="c47">日謀南進益迫切　英美法不容再誤　英如委曲求全必貽後悔　美國應於此際肩任艱鉅　中國評論週報促英闡明遠東政策 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>字林西報六月十四日東京特電云、此間許多觀察家皆信法國將被迫降服、果爾、則預料本對法屬越南及南太平洋法國殖民地新加萊杜尼亞島之政策、殆將較對東印度政策、趨積極、查越南與日方在華所佔地接壞、且近海南島、再、日本對於所傳滇越鐵路運輸火事巳提抗議、而新加萊杜尼亞島則有日僑經營鎳鐵兩物之重要利益、日人現料法國將單獨媾和、且公然討論分配法國殖民地矣、</p>
<p>代管島築　防禦工事</p>
<p>美人格拉丹氏、投文於亞細亞雜誌（Asia）稱、日人近年來經營太平洋國際代管島嶼、處心積慮、俟國際風雲緊張時、則將以此為南進之根據地、威脅英　法各國在南太平洋之屬地及權益、該文指出、過去五年間、日人曾竭力發展上述島嶼之航空交通、首先實行開設對日航空綫、各島嶼周圍所有之氣候氣流詳悄、均在日人掌握中、最近日人復計劃開闢抵達澳洲紐金尼亞之航空綫、日人在各烏嶼上所築海港及飛機塲之設施、規模龐大、以致引起國際代管地區委員會之疑慮、按調查所得、日人違反國際規定、確於各島上築有防禦工事、澳洲人士深信加羅林島上之特力克及瑪薩爾島上之喬祿特等地、確巳設防、但尙無確實證據、以證實之、該文最後謂日人利用此種島嶼、退可以防守日本在東亞之地位、進可以侵略美國防錢、南向澳洲及紐西蘭、東向英法荷屬地、如有戰事發生時、日人復能截斷美國與菲雜濱及馬來亞之聯絡、其威脅民中國家在南太平洋之權益，　可想見、</p>
<p>評論週報　促英覺悟</p>
<p>中國評論週報、近評論英國遠東政策云、「日人籍口維持荷屬東印度現狀、別具野心、證之本月三日有田在東京太平洋會議中之演說、即可了然、據有田稱、「列强如拒絕參加荷印等處之經濟開發、則日本與西方各國之衝突、勢將難免」、有田之演說、雖屢及荷印、但對海南一帶、未作顯明之劃分、其所指者、實包括英美法在遠東之利益所在地、其意無殊對英法美提出警吿、日　將以武力侵佔此等地區、一如其侵略中國者然、</p>
<p>英法屬地　危機四伏</p>
<p>日人又在中國南部海岸Ｎ海南島、集中海軍力量，以　脅英法美之南洋各屬地、觀乎美國對日之嚴厲態度，吾人雖可信日人或不致對荷印及菲列濱驟施武力、但觀乎英法對德之鏖戰方酣、無暇東顧、則史法之遠東屬地、實隨時有被日海軍乘機進襲、膏其饞吻之可能、如日人不以其在華泥足之深陷、則日人當早巳侵入杳港與安南矣、</p>
<p>如再容忍　自食其果</p>
<p>故日前日人、所最焦急萬分、急圖結束者、乃為對華之戰事、據　靠方面報吿、與日海軍結集海南島之消息而俱來者、即日央業巳開始其所謂「遠東問題」之談判、而日人則正圖威脅英法强迫其同意結束「對華事件」、造成東方之慕尼黑會議、此種報吿、己引起中國官方之驚異、訓令中國駐英大使、向英政府提出嚴重抗議英國方面、或將因共在歐洲備受德人之壓力、而圍委曲保全其遠東屬地、此種觀點實屬大謬、要知日人之慾難塡、英法如遂其所欲、則日本反將更進一步、而悍然攫取央法美之逮東利益也、</p>
<p>歐亞抗戰　同一目標</p>
<p>抑尤有進者、英法目前所渴待者、乃美　之援手、而其對德作戰之目標、又復旗幟鮮明、謂為「維持民治主義、使歐洲脫離德國之福軛」矣、但中國在亞洲之英勇抗戰、固亦具有同樣意義者、而日人之「東亞新秩序」與德人之「新秩序」、亦初無二致也、是則英法與中國、實應處於同一壁壘對暴力作戰、以擊敗彼人類中之野心家、</p>
<p>美國亟應　有所主張</p>
<p>回溯旣往、美國徵求英法協助、以維　東和平時、輙為英法所拒，而今英法在歐洲所處之地位、巳如中國、則又復希望美國之援助矣、故美國此際、實有權向英法提議、萬勿與日妥協、而造成東方之慕尼黑會議、蓋日人「東亞新秩序之建立、對中國固屬大不利、對美國之遠東利益、實亦一大打擊、歐洲民治主義之建立、固在英法之殊死抗爭、但亞洲之戰與歐洲之戰、實有小可分割之總係也、</p>
<p>英對遠東　母庸畏怯</p>
<p>中國為自由與正義而戰、於茲三年、勝利在望、世界人士、雖一致寄與同情、然中國之敵人、又復由各國供給其戰時必需原料、此種矛盾行為、以美國為尤甚、但在此種情形之下、中國作戰之力愈强、敵愾之心益盛、此其精神、實足驚異、英國內閣改組後一般對歐戰均絕無畏怯心理、吾人實深望英國政府對遠東態度、亦勿受日人威脅而有所恐懼如此、則聯軍作戰、固堅信心、美國同悄、亦可加深、中國人民、亦所切盼也、首相邱吉爾氏、實亟應闡明英國之遠東政策、以袪除外間對英之疑慮、同時更應積極與美國合作、以維　中國海南一帶之和平、而粉碎日人之幻夢」</p>

<p>字林西報昨載署名「舊游客之讀者來函云、茲有一事、請借貴報一角、為擬赴日本休假之讀者吿、即本市橫濱正金銀行內日方經濟專員拒不發給購買日元滙票之許可證是、</p>
<p>不能按照　本市滙率</p>
<p>查游客赴日、祇准携少許日元、逾額惟有購滙票始能携入、今不能照本市日　匯率購得匯票、則赴日休假所費均須增加四倍之多、因美金一元、在日本均僅合日金四元二十五錢也、</p>
<p>先定艙位　後購匯票</p>
<p>余友某君、擬游日本、橫遇困難、爰叙述之、為他人戒、本月十四日、余友造訪該經濟專員辦公處、探問彼及眷　赴日消夏所費、可否購備滙票、對方答曰、須先出示船票、始可准購　種滙票、</p>
<p>船票旣得　滙票不發</p>
<p>余友乃購就船票、價約日金千元、翌日持票復造該專員之門、詎竟被矢口回絕、余友抗辯曰、彼若未獲可購滙票之答覆、則不致購船票矣對方惟以冷然聳眉作答而已、余友無奈退出、今須退還船票徒遭無名損失、良以休假所費、苟照日金四元二十五錢滙率計算、非余友所堪負担也、</p>
<p>如此行爲　有玷盛譽</p>
<p>該專員之手段似非日方負責官員　應為、彼旣發表謂可購匯票之諾言、乃　食其言、實招毫無信義、小施詭計之汚名、凡重聲譽之國家、斷不許其官員出此行為也、設事先闡明小許購買滙票、則無人可發不平之言、惟據此而另定其休假計劃矣</p>

<p>— 徐瑞霖</p>
<p>集資二十五萬萬元贊助祖國建設</p>
<p>編者註：本文原文綦詳。對於抗建理論，頗多闡發：對於華僑愛國運動，又多叙述；於每種估計，每項建議，說明更不厭其詳。祇以本刋地位有限，只好節載要點。緒論及結論兩段，又只好從略。尙祈原作者譽諒！</p>
<p>華僑經濟力量之估量</p>
<p>關於海外倫胞的材料，十分貧乏；要對華僑的經濟力量，作準確的估價，是不容易的，不過常識就是科學的初步，根據常識，配合右干不同角度的測量，要迫近問題的中心，不是不可能的。</p>
<p>Ａ從人口方面觀察　據南洋鑑：華僑人口除暹維二百餘萬僑生不計外，總數為四，四九二，五六九人。據僑務委會之統計：華僑在南北美洲者三三〇，〇〇〇人，在南太平洋羣島及澳洲者，四五，（〇〇〇人，在歐洲各國者，三〇，〇〇〇人，在香港者，六一二，三一〇（戰前數目）人。總數七，四五九，一二〇人。據陳嘉庚先生最沂在重　發表的談話：（見三月二十七日港大公報　海外華僑總數，達一一，〇〇〇，〇〇〇人。這尙以戰前統計為基礎，戰後僑胞南渡為數日多。菲律賓一地，戰前華僑不過八萬人（見南洋鑑）。現在一般人相信有十二萬以上；增加三分之一；其他各地亦有大量增加。總之華倘的人口是在五百萬至一千二百萬之間；我們姑以把最低數五百萬立論。</p>
<p>假設華僑總數（或說適合我們抗戰經濟條件的）為五百萬人。根據這個數字來估量　僑的財富；據我們所知，華僑多數是生產成員，　數未在南洋成家。在五百萬華僑中，失業的約一百萬；無力生產者及婦孺為一百萬；生產者佔三百萬。每一個生產者，每年人息作叨幣三百六十元，三百萬人每年就是上萬萬八千萬叻幣，折合國幣為七十萬萬元左右。</p>
<p>這只是華僑的入息，　不是華僑財富的本銀。如以七十萬萬元作為本銀周年利息一分的數目，則本銀總額應是七百萬萬元。這數字眞够驚人了！</p>
<p>Ｂ從華僑實業觀察　據菲律賓農商部統計：華喬在菲投資為五〇二，〇二〇，三一三菲元；包括為售商，穀米，出入口業，布疋，椰，蔴，烟等業。其他不動產及建築物之投資，銀行及外商股票，尙不算入。單垊里拉一地，華僑之建築物即値二千萬菲元以上。銀打及外商股份又在二千萬左右；至於宿務，怡郎，三竇，顏納卯以及山頂洲府之土地房星，亦不下五干萬菲元。合上菲農商部統計，全菲華僑投資，最少當在六萬萬菲元。</p>
<p>菲律賓是只有十二萬華僑的地方，全部投資就有六萬萬菲元之多。假設南洋其他地方，每個華僑的投資額等於菲律賓華僑投資額百分之三十；那末除下菲律賓十二萬人（華僑總數作為五百萬算、其餘四百八十八萬人的投資總數，便有七十三萬二千萬菲元；加上菲律賓六萬萬餘元，則為八十萬二千萬菲元，折合　幣為五百六十萬萬餘元·而華人的勞動資本尙未計算在內。</p>
<p>Ｃ從每年內匯信銀觀察　據權威方面統計：一九三一年至一九三五年間，海外華僑內匯信銀，每年最高為四一二，二〇〇，〇〇〇元，最低為一二三二，八〇〇，〇〇〇元，平均中數為三三二，〇三八，〇〇〇元，此時正當世界不景氣，僑匯當受影響。當時我國外匯又在一先令五便士以上，與現在黑匯四辨士左右相差三倍，假設現在內匯價銀與前相等，那麼目前華僑每年內滙信銀，至少有七萬萬元國幣左右。假設海外僑胞需要匯款回國者，佔全部生產份子三百萬人的三分二；每人內滙款項，假設共為全年總收入（三六〇叻元）五分之一；由此推算，華僑每年的入息，當為國幣五十二萬五千萬元。假設這是一筆資本周息一分。那麼這筆資本就是五百二十五萬萬元了。</p>
<p>由上觀之，海外華僑的財富，據人口推算為國幣七白萬萬元，據實業投資推算，為國幣五百六十萬萬元，據內信滙銀推算為國幣五百二十萬萬元；換言之：華僑之財富，是在五白二十五萬萬至七白萬萬元之間。為便利推算計，假設華僑全部財富為五百萬萬元，每年生息五十萬萬元。如果華僑能將每年入息十分之一借興國家，作為平衡外滙之款項；國家每年就多五萬萬元的進款；能出下分之二，就有十萬萬元；這的確是一筆驚人的鉅款！</p>
<p>三年來之獻金運動</p>
<p>抗戰三年來華僑所表現的愛國熱淸，是極可頌贊的。第一値得指出者，就是這種愛國熱情的普遍性；無論那一階層，無論那一團　，男婦老少，賢愚貧富，都一致奮　起來！</p>
<p>華僑靑年的愛國，是無以復加的；他們不但在當地組織團　，舉行集會，宜傅鼓勵名種抗戰工作；更有無數靑年背着父母兄姊，放棄職業，遺產，趕回國內，當汽車夫，勤務兵，看護隊。為了祖國的生存，他們隨時可以犧牲自已的生命。</p>
<p>抵制劣貨的口號，華僑商人是當作命令來執行的。奸商同漢奸在他們的辭彙中是沒有分別的。</p>
<p>他們對於祖國的獻金，更蔚成空前熱烈盛大的運動。三年來華僑捐助抗戰的，據各方面統計，在二萬萬五千萬元以上。牠是從幾個方式得來：或是購買公債，或是直接獻金，或則按月認捐；但一出錢後，就不思再要回去。雖　這筆款只够祖國一個多月的戰費，但是因為牠是廣大熱情的結晶，祖國對牠應該當作二萬五千萬顆心來接受！</p>
<p>但是，作為反省的材料，我們還要提出一個問題：就是華僑已經充分表現出自巳的力量了麼？</p>
<p>如果華僑的財力够負擔二萬五千萬元的捐款；再加負擔，就有破產的危險；政府巳經收到這迫近保險綫的款目。那麼華僑的義務可算盡過了！</p>
<p>如果國家的需要不多，華僑所捐巳超過全國其餘同胞，那也木便再向華僑要求。</p>
<p>如果國家其他的外滙資源，巳有過剩；那麼華僑分攤這二萬五千萬元的鉅額戰費，也就可吿無憾於祖國了！</p>
<p>無如國家目前面對着的需要，十倍於二萬五千萬元；同時又無更便利更無害的途徑來籌補這個數目。而華僑的經濟能力，不但不是二萬五千萬元所能盡其量，根據前面的估量，尙有十百倍於二萬五千萬元的蘊藏；那麼我們便不能不苛刻一點說：抗戰三年來，華僑並未充分發揮自己的力量，也水完全盡了應盡的義務。二萬五千萬元的獻金，作為一萬五千萬顆心看；確是可貴的禮品。作為國家的需要看，那只等於一個多月的戰費。因此我們必需叫華僑的財力與心力相呼應，更叫華僑的經濟與租國的需要相配合！</p>
<p>長期貯蓄應付長期抗建</p>
<p>華僑海外的財富，根據前面的估量，在五百萬萬元至七百萬萬元之間；每年入息即有五十至七十萬萬元。在此千古一時民族國家生死存亡的關頭，華僑竭三個整年的努力，才捐到二萬五千萬元，不足三年來入息百分之二；這到底是甚麼原因呢？</p>
<p>華僑的熱心是無以復加的，僑領的領導也是無可非議的；三年來的成績所以跟不上祖國的需要，顯然不是熱心不熱心的問題，而是因為有許多有效的辦法，還沒有被採用；其中一憫特別値得我們提起的，就是我們目前所要推動的貯蓄運動。</p>
<p>貯蓄是累積財富的辦法之一，因為牠是一個輕而易舉的方式，可以化零為整，集中資本於無形，所以很普遍地被世界各國所採用。英國號　世界首富的國家，二次歐戰發生之時，政府即開始提倡「貯蓄代替捐款」，日本雖然資本相當集中，但是經過龐大的消耗之後，經濟基礎發生動搖，最近也巳實行强迫民衆貯蓄；以圖挽教於萬上。我國是經濟落後的國家，民族資本的積蓄，本來就很貧弱；全中國叫萬五千萬人中，很少拿得出一筆大款的人；在平時要從事實菓建設，巳感困難；在今日要加緊使國內生產，够適應抗建的要求中，比較困難。要補救這個缺憾，惟有鼓勵人民從事節約，普遍貯蓄之一途。</p>
<p>華僑是全國最有能力貯蓄之職員。如果平均每人每月節的叨幣二元，五百萬人一年間，就可集中一萬二千萬叨元；以現在滙水折算。等於國幣七萬萬元以上。在華僑目身每月節省二叨元，並不費力，累積此來的款項，却就有如許可觀。如把這筆貯蓄起來的款項全部借予政府，抗戰的經濟問題，就解決一大部份了！</p>
<p>貯蓄是一種長期的經濟活動。他並不像捐款獻金，進行到某一限度，就無法再進；而是越進行越有力，越持久越普通的事業。如果貯蓄下來的款項用來借與政府，那麼這種經濟活動，可說就是一種有恒的獻金活動。我們面對着一個長期的戰爭，所以需要一個有恒的長期獻金，來强調我們的國力。</p>
<p>把金錢捐助國家，是天經地義的法則；但是人類的心理是矛盾的：他不是完全自私，但也不能完全為公，作為一個人看，他免不了為自己着想；作為一個社會看，大家父不能不顧及大衆的利益。人格的發展，社會的進步，就在這矛盾中携手並進。捐款救國當然不是決定個人的利益，因為國家强盛，個人所將取償於國家者，正復無限。但是這個算盤，到底複什一點；不能顯著的適應人類心理的矛盾。如果把捐款作為貯蓄，把貯蓄下來的款項代為利人金融食本，再把這款借給國家，這就是私款公用；對國家的利益不减於損款；而在出錢的民衆，却是一注可靠的投資，公私利益，相提並論；這才是人類心理上矛盾中之統一，於一般出錢民衆，才是一個世上的鼓勵。</p>
<p>由貯蓄方式集中的資本，就是應用在壟斷性的實業上，也沒有利潤為私人獨佔的危險。因為作為道個資本的主人的，是一個廣大的平民集團；所有利潤終仍歸諸大衆。再者，這是為了救國而集中的資本，牠弟一步就是有益於國家，國家對牠不但會給予絕對的保障，而且會給予擾厚的利益；當茲全國上下致力鼓勵生產建設之時，這筆資本可能獲得的利潤，必將超過世界任何市塲之投資。因為這個放款，以整個國家為對象，其担保之健全，比較任何銀行為可靠，以全國富藏為投資範圍，其利潤更非其他事業所能比。這種投資，公私並顧；救國就是救己，義務就是權利；意義彰明，毫無疑問。以海外華僑愛護祖國之熱烈，一定普遍地響應這個運動。誠如我們所期待的實現起來，那麼國家每年所能取給於僑胞的戰費，便不是三年二萬五千萬的區區數額，而是每年五萬萬至七萬萬的鉅款；抗戰一日不結束，這個貯蓄運動一日不終止；在國家則財源川源不息，在華僑則資本愈積愈多，一旦勝利到頭，把這筆資本用來開發國內實業，對建設國之計的貢獻，更非數字所能形容了！</p>
<p>但這是原則的建議，要使牠成為一個普遍的運動，還需要一個提綱挈領的機關去推勳牠。因此我們建議組織一個銀公司，來處理這個事務；現在假設牠的名稱為華僑貯蓄放款建設銀公司。</p>
<p>組織華僑貯蓄放款建設銀公司</p>
<p>華僑貯蓄放款建設銀公司，以集中貯款，貸借政府，强調抗戰經濟，參加後方建設為宗旨；公司資本以華僑貯蓄款項為基礎。假設華僑有力參加貯蓄者為三百萬人，平均每人每月貯蓄二叻元，全年可得叻幣七千二百萬元；折同國幣的當五萬萬元。公司接受貯款期間，暫定為五年；每年集中五萬萬，五年可得廿五萬萬元；則定為本公　資本之總額。</p>
<p>公司每月所收貯款，當為貯戶股本；一槪存人當地中國銀行，以周息六厘借與政府，每月結算一次；每次過戶，先扣回一年利息，作為公司發展基本建設事　之資本。如每年貿收貯款五萬萬元，則公司　一年可得利息三千萬，第二年六千萬，第三年九千萬，第四年一萬二千萬；單憑這筆利息，則可在國內發展一倪略具規換的實業。五年後抗戰勝利，秩序恢復，政府有力淸還母錢，則公司可成一　最有三十萬萬元以上之資本集團。</p>
<p>但是我們要怎樣發動這個事業呢？</p>
<p>第一，需要一個建全的理讑，首先應　員全國的經濟學者，從各個角度來討論及批評這個問題。</p>
<p>第二，需要一個嚴密的實踐方案。應延攬全國第一流專家，從事公司自辦　貯蓄放款以至於各種具體實業建設的設計。</p>
<p>第三，應當與領導抗建的政府取得密切聯絡。凡公司一切立法計劃，皆當通過政府負責機關，更當嚴格接受政府的監督。</p>
<p>第四，一個偉大的事業，需要一個雄厚的後盾。華僑貯蓄放款建設銀公司，無疑地是個偉大的事業；牠的成功與失敗，將視牠能吾取得社會上各階層的先知先覺之贊助？能吾取得廣大羣衆之響應？所以必需遍徵國內外的先進，請他們以贊助人發起人的名義，來支持道個運動。</p>
<p>第五，海外僑胞愛國熱情是普遍的，但能取得機會而充分發揮是愛國精神的還佔少數。我們知道各埠華僑羣衆中，有着整千萬有志有為的鬥士，墊代在角落裹而被人抹煞的；但當他們取得一個勞力的機會時，他們所能為國家効勞的，決不少於其他的僑胞。所以我們要極力去發現這批潛藏的鬥士，使他們出來參加這個運動。</p>
<p>第六，各地贊助發起人微齊之後，我們不妨先來一個發起人大會，成立一個臨時理事會及臨時辦事處，聞始號台華僑實行貯蓄，無與政府機關接洽各種收款　款手續，並簽定必要契約。</p>
<p>第七，第一年度股本集齊之後，按股　召集股東代表大會，推選正式理事成立理事會；並宣吿公司正式成立，取消臨時理事會及臨時辦事處。</p>
<h3 id="c85">市場知識顧問　劉褀君來問 <a href="#c85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>

<p>（三）以港幣或越幣在香港或海防購置美金，是否較在上海用法幣買美金為有利。</p>
<p>法定匯準，即中央政府統制下之對外匯率，英匯為一先令二便士二五，美匯為二十九元半（至其算法可參考發行楊蔭溥先生听著之「經濟常識」。）</p>
<p>（一）黑市　率，欲知黑市滙率之變動，須先明白「黑市」二字之義意，上海向為自由市塲，進口多於出口，據海關貿易冊所載，數十年來均爲入超，故需用大量外匯，自中央下令統制後，限制甚厲，非經正當手續，不得申請外匯，自國軍西移後，中央勢力鞭長莫及，投機家乘機活動，興波作浪，從中取利，形成黑匯市塲，雖中央匯豐掛脾，仍維持不動，而黑市瞬息萬變，係屬不正當之交易，將來政府可下令取締，故黑市市價無一定之標準，全視供求情形及時局變化為轉移。</p>

<p>為夫婦脫輻因素</p>
<p>講到夫婦間一旦反目後所受到的慘局，簡直難以形容，卽使幸運碰着一位個性較為和順的妻子，雖在表面上仍吿鎭靜而暗中自怨自嘆，終日為之不歡。萬一碰着一位性情不羈的女子，則勢必反唇相護，互相爭噪，甚至法庭相見，下堂求去，此皆由於丈夫身患隱病，性情微弱，或發育不全，致生殖工作上不能協調，始演出生離死別的悽事。</p>
<p>余為性病之專科醫師，醫師以保障病象之議利為前提，深信此種疾病，切忌購服新牌廉價劣藥，蓋市上雜藥層出不窮，尤其以偽製之國藥成分製就之西藥補劑，花樣百出，亂說胡道，什麼用銀耳，龜版，虎骨製成的呀！甚或又說加入人參，燕窩，鹿茸等等，須知此種藥品不僅絕無此種成分，亦絕無此種情事，蓋　國藥成分製成西藥補劑，此種提煉方法尙未發明，亦無發明之必要，為什麼呢？旣要服中藥補品，何勿直接購此煎服，凡此種種，均為負責之言，諸君不信，本埠國藥店到處皆是，不妨去請敎店裹夥友，有吾此種情事，及此種以國藥成分為號召以西藥形態騙人的劣藥究竟有吾其所說之成分，當能恍然而明。須知精腎兩虧的原因，由於主宰性慾的靑春腺受手淫或縱慾斵傷而起，故必須服以雄壯動物靑春腺素製劑男用「補體康」，良由「補體康」除採用動物性內分泌為主要成分之外，並有補腦之燐質，補血之鐵質及補骨之鈣質摻入，確具補腦，補腎補精之功惟有遺精者應以「耐而斯遺精片」治之，女子月經不調貧血，乳瘟，發育不全，應服女用「補體康」。</p>

<p>— 德國醫學博士　王克春</p>
<p>淋病之採用化學療法，原不是自今日始，惟其以化學療法之成功，則始於今日也。在此等療法發明之後，淋病患者，開始如梅毒之獲得解放了。因為現在巳有最新淋病化學療法「新克淋儂」，此劑爲德國淋病學家彼德博士，多年彼德博士，多年來努力研究改良之結果。原來淋病之雙球菌，十分頑强，能抵禦弱性之殺菌力，並富有繁殖力，使吾人未完全將淋菌完全殺菌時，彼已另有新徒衆，重新向內部發展，此所以一般市上殺菌藥不能奏效之原因。惟「新克淋儂」一藥，本根據化學療法之原理，而更加改良所成功。其殺菌力十分强大而迅速，但無一般化學療法之不良反應。凡服德國「新克淋儂」後，所有深淺層的淋菌可以全部扑滅，故不論急慢性一切白濁，無不徹底根本解決。至於外用藥男子可外用「抗淋水」按圖與說明書，在家秘密自行洗滌尿道。女子可外用「卡而雪地陰道片」為坐藥。內服「新克淋儂」（三藥太和藥房均售）</p>

<p>淋病的象徵，除去排出的尿液如米　色之狀外，還有牽連不絕的淋系，源源從尿道內排出，此等淋系之不絕，就是證明淋病未愈之現象。凡是內部有淋菌踪跡所在之處，部有炎症發生　而這些炎症，又為淋系製造的條件。有淋系自是淋病未愈之證。但亦有淋系雖絕，而淋病依然未愈者。則必須具有經騐之醫師，方有辨別之能力。至淋系之形狀，也很一不一致，有形如點狀的，有形如敝狀的。此種淋系，以患有後尿道淋之殘留的炎症為多。而膀胱炎，攝護腺炎亦多患之。故要掃除此等淋系，必須用面而俱到之療法，在內服藥中，不得不推最新化學療法「新克淋儂」（永安公司有售）為巨擘了。而理學療法方面，則以德國靜電療法為最。余恒合用此等療法，能將淋系解決，淋病根治，效騐非凡兼治梅毒橫痃下疳，性神經衰弱等症</p>

<p>— 梅子</p>
<p>夏季已到，白色的衣服又將觸目皆是了，不過這種白色的最易受髒，且稍有一點齷齪受着，就很靴看，勢非洗過不可。</p>
<p>因此，在夏天穿衣，得處處留心，譬如在坐凳子之前，總得先看看凳子上是否淸潔？最好先用手帕揩一下，或者在辦公室裏的時候，可以用白紙一張襯在凳上，以免受髒；另外走樓梯時，也得將長衫提高些，可以保持衣服的淸潔小少。回到家裹，可即把長衫短杉褲脫掉，（祇穿汗衫短褲凉快而便利）折疊整齊後放在衣櫉內，切勿隨手向衣架上一掛，這樣必可减少洗衣的次數，當然這對於衣服的受壞至少可以減少些。</p>
<p>其次，倘在辦公室裏，也可把短衫的袖口义起，領口向外翻折着，這樣出汗時只有汗衫受濕，洗起來祇洗汗衫好了</p>
<p>另外關於洗衣，總要可囑自己的夫人或傭婦們輕輕的洗，晒時放得整齊些，挺些，因爲洗衣的當心與否，對於衣服本身的破壞很有關係，不宜濫洗，晒得等到稍乾時，即可收下摺起來，摺後用包袱包好後放在桌子上，再用凳子壓在上面，或放在凳上自己坐在上面，坐的一小時，就可和燙下來一樣的整齊了；這樣非但可以省去電費，且衣服還小容易壞呢。總之，夏天穿衣，是處處不能隨便的。</p>
<h3 id="c104">談米 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— 綠葉</p>
<p>國以民爲本，民以食爲天，國不可無民，人不可無食。半年來，租界當局在民食上面，雖然盡了不少的力，可是奸商的操縱，囤積，仍舊公然行動，米價每石破六十元關；那些謀生不易小得已而作奸犯科的人，實在迫於無可奈何。推原禍始，這個影響治安的責任，盜匪與奸商都得共同担負。</p>
<p>上海人一日三餐，以米爲主，麫粉雖也是民食之一，但它的銷路不及米暢旺。上海的食米，每日需要總額雖無正確統計可資參證，但以市塲銷售數目平均計算約在五千石以上。其他轉口交易尙不在內。</p>
<p>米的來源不一，自本省各地來的叫「杜米」；自外省各地來的叫「客秈」；自外洋進口的叫「洋米」。</p>
<p>「杜米」多半從常熱，無錫，靑浦，崑山，松江，泗涇等處運來：貨色以常熟爲最佳。常熟米籽大粒勻，質軟色白，煮成熟飯，香糯爽滑，漲性極强，一碗米可以煮成三碗飯，精明的家庭主婦最樂於選購。「客秈」大多來自蕪湖，九江，額色不白，顆粒尖長，須入廠重碾，才能出售。「洋米」由安南用外洋商船裝滬，籽細小面枯燥，上海人本不喫洋米，但自米價高貴以來，已紛紛改吃洋米了。洋米中有一種最上等的，出自　　，籽長大而明凈，最合於煎飯，其味不亞於杜米。這種最上等的洋米，普通的店鋪裹是無售的，只有幾家廣東食品店裹有售，前一些時，大新公司的底　也會售過，每磅在五角以上。</p>
<p>米的名目繁多，杜米與客秈，不過總名而已。詳細的名目還有十幾種：如白粳，通變－又名白元，俗稱糯米，薄稻，早粳，紅稻，香粳，野稻，陰元，洋尖，杜尖，埠尖，菱白尖，蘆尖等。</p>
<p>糯米，製糕餅等需用，又爲釀酒的主要原料，來源以丹陽爲主。薄稻－又名晚粳，含有粘性，行銷天津，大連，靑島等埠，市價和頭號白粳並駕齊驅。早粳，紅稻，沿京滬各埠均有出產。香粳是煎粥的上品，不但適口，目淸香撲鼻。羊尖－又名洋秈，漲性甚佳，但不粘糯，較粳米有天淵之別，不宜做餅餌，只可做飯。它的來源，從金壇，澳陽，宜興等處運滬，銷路以天津，福建，寗波爲多。杜尖－又名杜秈，粒圓；與粳米相仿，小米店中多與白粳對攙後出售。菱白尖，是在菱白生長的時候所收穫的杜尖叫菱白尖。蘆尖，係蘆尖正肥的時候所收穫的叫蘆尖。羊尖，因爲顆粒瘦長如羊角，故名。這些定名，在米業中人的口中道出，有點使人換不着頭腦，其實一經說破，又無足爲奇！</p>
<p>北平，天津，濟南，太原等地的人，居留在上海，不常吃米，而常食小米粥，所謂小米，是一種富有粘性的黍榖，和上海人喂鳥的那種細米差不多。但小米粥極有滋養料，甘平和胃，柔糯適口，代價又不及粳米昂，眞是最佳的食品。</p>
<p>米價一漲再漲，有些人主張用粳米燒粥吃，我也很表同情。古人有一首吃粥的詩，不妨吟</p>
<p>「煮飯何如煮粥强，好同女兒熟商量！一升可作二升用，兩日堪爲六日糧；有客不妨添水火，無錢何必問羹湯，莫嫌淡泊無滋味，淡泊之中滋味長。」</p>

<p>今年吃新蠶豆的時期，似乎很短，不多幾時，豆已老了。近來豆的價格，每斤在二角五分左右，在這物價飛漲的時候，還小算很貴；况且豆類富於維太命，不妨多吃一些。不過老蠶豆的煮法，却沒有幾種，倘要多翻花樣，實在不容易翻。家常最普通的；是將豆出了殼，攤成了沙，與雪菜子或葱花同炒，倘要省些醬油，那麼只消用鹽，醬油完全小用。還有一個做法，就是不攤沙，而單用豆瓣，與雪菜一同做湯，略加蔴油，倒也淸鮮可口。此外可以不去皮殼，用醬紅燜，做塢穌豆吃。至於葷的做法，不大聽得，我曾經把猪肉（牛肉亦可）刴成了泥，和蠶豆沙同炒，吃時略用辣醬油，很有西餐風味，讀者不妨一試。</p>

<p>美國凱塞城兒童部統計兒童在家庭中玩忽而死傷的原因，可分幾點：（一）中間凹下去的，或已破舊的樓梯的階級，（二）掛用的，繫用的繩子已很鬆弛，萬一斷了，重物便會跌下，（三）碎石，碎玻璃散在地上，未曾收拾，（四）小刀，义子，竹片之類沒有放好，孩子玩了切斷手指是數見不鮮的事，統計記錄亦最多。</p>
<p>這不過是最普通的幾點，此外兒童部指出下列各點的做到，必可大大减少家庭中的不幸。（一）開着的窗子，如無鐵梗，裝些皮條或繩子亦行，（二）樓梯上面應裝柵門，則兒童嬉戲梯旁可無顧慮，（三）樓梯底部，有的家庭中，如很黑暗，落脚不能作準，有過多次摔交，所以在底部，應加白漆，（四）毒品如來沙而等應放在孩子拿不到的地方，其他藥品亦應如此，否則瓶盒亦應以膠黏之綫帶封固四週，（五）家用爐子，如能安放水銅吊的，自然很好，不過有的爐子上部高低不平，銅吊在上，一碰即翻，因爲燙傷亦是家庭不幸事件中最普通的。</p>
<p>以上各點，我們相信一般家庭能採納實行，必很有利，而安全家庭和危險的家庭的分別，亦即在此。</p>

<p>— 商人</p>
<p>據前幾天的消息，法租界警務處檢查界內各商店，發現非法營業者達百餘起之多，都已分別判處罰金。這有力的肅淸工作至少給一般惟利是圖的商人一個嚴重的打擊。但是事情出於意料之外，昨日本報的消息是：「法租界物品種類八十三項中，漲價者佔二十四項，其中十八項更高於蘇州河以南公共租界之價目。」這不是偶然的現象，是說明了罰款無用。</p>
<p>因爲抬高價格在他毋看來已經不是非法營業了，即使被警務處查到了而罰幾個錢，也無關痛癢，所謂「羊毛出在羊身上」，在當局偶一，疏忽的時候（事實上警務處也不能每天到各商店去檢查），他們依然能够取償於主顧的。所以要撲滅這種「價格我自漲之」的現象，在罰款之外，非有更嚴厲的制裁不可！</p>
<p>嚴厲的制裁者何？宣佈店號是也。如果把那被罰的一百餘商店的詳細地址店名公告於全市民之前，俾大家牢記着他們是「黑店」，而裹足不前，使他們營業上受到打擊，那才能以儆傚尤。</p>

<p>— 陳多</p>
<p>「要坐一歇哦？」當我們漫無目標地在遊戲塲東闖西撞的時候，一個裝束入時微帶妖艷的女人，柔聲地請求似的詢問着我們。</p>
<p>我們搖搖頭，意思是不要。那女人見我們不能實現她的希望，懊喪地去搜尋另一個主顧了。</p>
<p>同事孫碰碰我的臂膀，輕輕地吿訴我：『這就是「玻璃杯呀」！』</p>
<p>『爲甚麽好端端的一個人叫她做「玻璃杯」呢？』</p>
<p>『那大概因爲她們賣茶的緣故。茶不是盛在玻璃杯裏的嗎？人們就用那個名詞象徵了那種女人？』他接着說：『我有一個紗廠裹的女同事也在這兒做玻璃杯，你要不要看她一下？』</p>
<p>我點點頭，跟着他到了八層樓一個小花園中，孫找着了他以前的同事，一個二十多歲的姑娘。</p>
<p>孫出其不意地向她打了一個招呼，泡了一杯茶，並把我介紹給她。一陣紅暈淡淡地隱現在她那塗滿了脂粉的臉上，她彷彿有無限羞愧似的。</p>
<p>孫向她解釋：『這是你爲生活所迫，沒有關係的。』接着她告訴我們：</p>
<p>『我以前本和孫先生是同事，我們同在楊樹浦××紗廠，他是職員，我在試騐科任事，戰事以後，紗廠停閉，職員，工人全部解散，從此便跌落在失業的在潮裏。但是沒有事情父怎能活下去呢？不得已才到這兒來幹這種事情，說起來也很慚愧的。</p>
<p>『幹道種事情只要有熟人（大多是稽查）介紹就行了，無須保證金的。每一部份，少的有二三十個，多的如下面的大京班有一百多人。我們沒有薪水，每天還須包給賬房間十杯茶的茶錢，一杯兩角錢，就是說每天須付兩塊錢。餘多的才是你的進款，少了就必得墊出來。</p>
<p>『我們所招待的客人各種階層都有：工人，小職員，馬路英雄，…我們的生活之資是全靠那些客人多賞一些，普通吃了一杯茶，至少給我們五六角，好的客人也有給我們一塊多的。</p>
<p>『我們這種生活也很苦，塲子這麽小，同業又這麽多。戲分日夜兩塲，每塲做到五六杯或七八杯，已經是「拿馬溫」了，大多祇有一杯，二杯，有許多還要「吃鴨蛋。…</p>
<p>我們付了錢。向她吿別的時候，順便將這一部份作了一個鳥瞰。但見一張張的籐榻裹，躺着各式各樣的人物，旁邊都有所謂「玻璃杯」的或立或坐地陪伴着，她們正爲着獲得每天的生活資料而娓娓不倦地灌着「迷湯」呢。但有許多却不安地走動着，像臘犬似地向四面張望，在找她們的主顧。</p>
<p>當我們走出時，已經十點鐘了，我們看看賬櫃上放着的水牌板上，有許多「玻璃杯」的芳名下面，還寫有一劃二劃；有許多名字下面，還是空無所有的「白卷」呢。</p>

<p>第一章　「一位挺漂亮的小姐！」</p>
<p>倪金壽答道：「沒有－還沒有。我一到這裏，向　李老頭兒談了幾句，覺得這案子很複雜，我就叫他上樓去等着。我又把三個僕人分派在三處，就先打電話給你。接着我又打到警廳裹去，叫他們放載屍車來。因着電話綫的阻隔，躭擱了好一回。隨後我在這牆壁上發見了那粒槍彈，就着手箝取。因此，我還沒有功夫細瞧。」他說完了便匆匆走出室去。</p>
<p>倪金壽解釋的時候，霍桑早已伸手去開那抽屜。抽屜的鎖孔上果然留着一枚小鑰匙，鑰匙柄上並沒附着什麽環子，的確很容易忽過。霍桑開抽屜時，不曾旋動那鎗匙，抽屜便應手而開，顯見不曾下鎖。</p>
<p>抽屜裏的東西似乎很値得注意。最觸目的，就是三大疊用蔴綫繫着的法幣，估量起來，每疊大概是一千。還有幾張男子的照片，尺寸雖不一律，却都是「時代靑年」。此外還有一個鋼質塗鎳的鐵箱鑰匙。霍桑把幾張照片的略瞧了一瞧，又在許多請帖紙件裏翻了一翻，單把那枚鑰匙從抽屜裏拿出來。他說道：「這錀匙就是那邊鐵箱上的罷。」他斜側着身子，靠這會客室的西北角指了指。</p>
<p>我開始向這室中作一度迅速的巡禮。塗蠟的狹條麻栗地板上，鋪着一大方高價的厚地毯，那泥足印就接到這地毯爲止。在死者座位背後的右邊，有一隻白石面的小圓桌，圍着四隻精緻的皮墊短背椅子。圓桌上除了一個舶來品的銅花瓶以外，有一隻銀質盤花的烟灰盆，盆中有好幾個烟尾。還有兩隻玻璃杯，一隻杯子裏，還剩着些殘餘的香樓酒。在這小圓桌的更右，靠壁放着一隻紫色絲絨的長椅，椅上有三個圓形的錦墊，也並不例外地都是舶來品。長椅端的靠手上，放着一件淺藍色絲絨的短大衣，分明是死者身上脫下來的。（十七）</p>

<p>Bordeaux Port - The General Headquarters issued a war bulletin this morning stating, "The intensity of the front-line battles has reached its peak in the past 24 hours. The enemy has deployed fresh troops to the front lines to join the fighting, using various powerful weapons to launch fierce attacks on the heights of Langres. Their vanguard units have crossed the Argonne Forest, reaching the vicinity of Glennes. Although our forces are smaller in number and have inferior armaments, they are still fighting heroically, offering resolute resistance." (Havas News Agency dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<p>Hitler's Headquarters - The German High Command announced yesterday that German forces, after breaking through the Maginot Line on both banks of the Meuse River, have already occupied the Verdun fortress and its urban area. (Haitong News Agency dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The German Supreme Command announced that German troops yesterday, after capturing two fortresses on the Maginot Line, had broken through a vast section of the line south of Saarbrücken. The Supreme Command also announced that the city and forts of Verdun were captured by German forces yesterday. It is noted that this area was one of the major bloody battlefields of the last European war. The main defensive forts of Verdun, Fort Douaumont and Fort Vaux, have both been occupied. Authoritative circles solemnly declared, "Germany will not rest until the enemy is completely subdued." Rumors of peace negotiations were also denied. German sources said that the French army is currently putting up fierce resistance on the Maginot Line, using the depth and breadth of the line to transport large quantities of supplies, stockpiling provisions for more than a year of use. (United dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<p>Somewhere in France - According to military sources, the German army's plan to break through the Maginot Line has had little effect. As for the German troops occupying the Paris area, they are launching a new offensive southeast along the Seine River and the upper reaches of the Marne River, aiming to attack the rear of the Maginot Line from the flank. These German troops have crossed the Seine River in the Romilly-sur-Seine area and broken through the town of Saint-Thierry. The vanguard of their motorized units advanced towards the Argonne Forest last night. At the same time, the German army is increasing pressure on the French army across the entire front, forcing the French army to retreat further south after abandoning Paris. In addition, German troops west of Paris, after breaking through the towns of Troyes and Évreux, have advanced to western Normandy, occupying the port of Le Havre and areas south of the Seine River. (Havas News Agency dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<p>Berlin - While the churches here are still ringing their bells to celebrate the occupation of Paris, the German High Command announced the capture of Verdun and the breakthrough of the Maginot Line south of Saarbrücken. People in Berlin were greatly surprised, as in the last World War, the German army began its attack on Verdun on February 21st, lasting half a year, with over a million casualties on both sides, but never conquered Verdun. This time, however, it was announced to be occupied in just [blank] hours, which is truly a miracle. (Haitong dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<h3 id="e2">German Army War Bulletin <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Hitler's Headquarters - This afternoon, the German war bulletin stated that the entire front, from the Swiss border to the English Channel, is under German control. The German army is pursuing its victories with rapid progress, and the number of prisoners increases daily. Southeast of Paris and on the upper reaches of the Marne River, German tanks and mechanized units are advancing south, having crossed the Langres plateau. The fortresses of Verdun and nearby forts are all in German hands. The Longuyon fortress, known for its strength, has also been occupied by German forces. German military aircraft and anti-aircraft guns assisted troops in crossing the upper reaches of the Rhine River. German fighter planes, dive bombers, and destroyers are active throughout the entire front, destroying thirty train cars and burning several trains carrying military supplies. In total, the enemy lost forty aircraft yesterday, eleven of which were shot down in air combat, nine shot down by anti-aircraft guns, and the rest destroyed on the ground. Seven German aircraft are missing. A submarine that recently returned to Germany reported that it sank a troop transport ship with a displacement of 12,000 tons on May 30th. Another submarine reported that it fired a torpedo at a British auxiliary cruiser, inflicting heavy damage or sinking it. The ship's displacement was 14,000 tons. (Haitong dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<p>French Forces Dispersed, Acknowledge Serious Situation</p>
<p>Bordeaux Port - French military officials recently stated that the enemy is increasing pressure on the entire front today, forcing French retreating troops to continue their southward retreat. The French cabinet is holding an emergency meeting here with the heads of the army, navy, and air force. "But it is undeniable that the military situation has become extremely serious. All of our divisions have been deployed to the front lines for combat. Since our forces are dispersed, we cannot deploy heavy troops to each front line, so our defenses are truly lacking in depth. In addition, it is well known to the world that we have no reserve forces to dispatch and that military equipment is urgently needed." As for the military situation on the front lines, the General Headquarters issued a war bulletin tonight, the main points of which are as follows: (1) In the eastern Alsace region, German troops near Neuf-Brisach have crossed the Rhine River but have not yet broken through the French lines. (2) On the western coast, German troops are advancing along the coast towards Le Havre, while those on the south bank of the Seine have crossed the towns of Troyes and Évreux. (3) In the central Paris region, German troops are advancing eastward in pursuit of their victories, crossing the Seine River in the Romilly-sur-Seine area. Another unit has broken through the town of Saint-Thierry, and its vanguard troops have advanced towards the town of Argonne Forest. (Havas News Agency dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<p>Italian Troops Assist German Operations, Penetrate Southern France</p>
<p>Rome - According to the Italian military bulletin, Italian troops are continuing their attack on the French border, penetrating into French territory, repelling several French counterattacks. (Taiwan Public Dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<p>Rome - According to a military bulletin, Italian forces recently bombed military facilities in southern France, dropping many tons of heavy bombs on Le Cannet, north of Cannes, and the town of Sospel, northeast of Turbie. More than forty French aircraft were destroyed, and several ammunition depots were also destroyed. However, five Italian aircraft did not return to base after this air raid. (United Press dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<p>Geneva - According to recent reports, Italian troops have arrived in the Rhineland to assist German troops in attacking the French Maginot Line. (Havas News Agency dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<p>Rome - According to news received here yesterday, Italian troops along the Alpine border advanced towards Nice yesterday. It is reported that French fresh troops have been deployed to the southern front to prepare to resist a large-scale invasion. (United Press dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<p>French Forces Fight Hard to Save the Situation, Hoping for American Assistance Like Watching for Clouds</p>
<p>London - According to special dispatches from here, the question of how long the French army can continue to hold out against a far larger enemy force has become increasingly agonizing in the past 24 hours. It is estimated that 2 million German troops are participating in the battle from the coast to the Meuse River, including several fresh divisions. The French retreat behind Paris has further lengthened their lines. In French Prime Minister Reynaud's appeal to President Roosevelt, he also stated that German aircraft and tanks are superior. Officials have not attempted to conceal the extremely dangerous nature of the war situation. Both the east and west fronts, from the coast to the Meuse River, are now under threat. In the western region, German armored units are followed by large numbers of well-equipped motorized divisions. The urgency of the situation at the eastern end is no less. However, the French army has been able to defend the Montmirail hub, which has a mobile line of [blank] the Maginot Line. In the past 24 to 48 hours, the war may have reached its critical point. French forces have made superhuman efforts [blank], suffering enormous losses, but are still fighting the enemy with their remaining strength. However, if active assistance from other civilized countries cannot arrive quickly, then the future is grim and cannot be concealed. France is now facing one of the most tragic moments in its history, hoping daily to see a cloud the size of a hand appear in the sky over the Atlantic, a sign of French [blank] aircraft arriving. But they must arrive, and they must arrive in the thousands. (Reuters dispatch from the 16th)</p>

<p>Copenhagen - Three Danish journalists had the opportunity to visit the Maginot Line. One of them published an article in the Afnavis newspaper yesterday, describing his impressions of the Maginot Line. The article stated that France boasts of having spent 10 billion francs on building the Maginot Line, but this huge sum would have been enough to build a hundred Elizabeth-class battleships. The Maginot Line is designed to prevent attacks, so its construction includes water tanks, food [blank], and car pools, all of which can store enough supplies for several months. If the defending forces in each section of the line are cut off, they will not be captured by the enemy or surrender to the enemy, because there are underground tunnels that can retreat to the rear. Their entrances and exits are extremely secret. (Haitong Ray dispatch from the 16th)</p>

<p>London - A Reuters reporter asked responsible officials today about rumors from the German and Italian sides. The answer was that the Allies are continuing to cooperate as closely as before.

It is important to know that these messages are all unfounded. (Reuters dispatch from the 16th)</p>

<h3 id="e6">Far Eastern Stirrings Amidst European Developments <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>The Allied forces of Britain and France are fighting hard without success, and Paris has finally fallen. This is the most dramatic and significant development in recent days; its significance may only be comparable to the fall of Constantinople in the Middle Ages. However, in today's world, where human reason and intelligence have reached unprecedented levels, it is not necessarily the case that force is the supreme authority! In the past, the fall of Constantinople led to the complete annihilation of Eastern European civilization, which inherited the Greek tradition; but this time, the fall of Paris certainly does not mean the demise of democratic civilization. Of course, after this defeat, the subsequent restoration of order will be ten or a hundred times more difficult; and all people who love freedom and democracy in the world will also feel ten or a hundred times the burden. It is unbearable to look back, judging from conscience, both hating and regretting! But after regret, there are only wise and courageous people who can be steadfast and more motivated to deal with the current and future difficulties. Not only to cope, not only to have such aspirations, but to firmly believe that unless the universe is destroyed in an instant, the return of light is inevitable and not far off.</p>
<p>The United States is a major factor in stabilizing world changes, with its calm and rational observation of world events. Therefore, while paying attention to the situation in Europe, it can also pay close attention to the turbulence in the Far Eastern situation. In recent days, the solemn statements of President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull are precisely expressions of their rationality and a guarantee that democratic civilization will never fall. There is no clearer contrast: in these days of European developments, the so-called reformists in Japan have become very active, taking advantage of the changes in Europe, touting their old tune of joining the German-Italian alliance and vigorously pursuing a southward advance policy. They have seen that the resistance China has encountered in its aggression is no different from divine punishment, and they have divided their efforts to engage in both military and peace offensives against China. They have released all kinds of boring and unbelievable peace rumors, and they have driven their dwindling, exhausted troops to steal the fur of Germany's new battle achievements, launching guerrilla attacks in the hinterland of Central China, and indiscriminately bombing Chinese rear cities with airplanes, initially not showing any restraint due to the US's moral embargo and protests. Instead, they have intensified their actions, even demanding that third-country nationals withdraw from Chongqing. On the part of the major powers, such as the settlement of the Anglo-Japanese Tianjin Incident, and some American politicians advocating accommodating Japan's arguments, are undoubtedly reactions caused by Japan's recent posture. We are not at all surprised, knowing that international situation is so chaotic that whether belligerent or non-belligerent countries, each has its own difficulties. It is inevitable that paying attention to the European situation will neglect other aspects. Therefore, we should not demand perfection with regard to matters related to the Far East. What must be clearly pointed out is that accommodating reality has its insurmountable limits, and that the iron rule of resisting aggression must be adapted to both the West and the Far East. Under the iron rule, there is no room for trickery. But looking at the past two or three years, Britain and France have spent a lot of effort and paid a heavy price to dismantle the German-Italian axis, but the result is still that they cannot prevent Italy from joining the European war. This is an iron fact and an iron lesson under the iron rule. The West and the Far East are the same in this matter.</p>
<p>Japan's offensive against China has not caused China any fear, and China's simple and resolute response is only to resist with real strength. What we want to further explain is that the international situation in the Far East is also very complex. Currently, various forms of turbulence are still developing. What is hoped for from the authorities of the countries concerned is to recognize the following three basic principles:</p>
<p>First, the safety and security of the Far East are actually tied to China's resistance war. For the nine months since the outbreak of the European war, Japan's ambition has been extremely high, but in action, it has always dared not to take risks lightly. This is absolutely not due to the appeasement policy of the major powers, nor is it due to Japan's goodwill towards the major powers. The main reason is that most of Japan's strength has been restrained by China, so that it cannot turn around. Japan's recent indiscriminate offensive against China, including bombing, although has its own internal political reasons, is also sufficient to show its anxiety to end the war. The more firm and powerful China's resistance is, the smaller the possibility of Japan expanding to other areas. In other words, China's resistance and the Far Eastern interests of the major powers are indeed linked. The argument that preparations should be made to make slight concessions to Japan in exchange for its benevolent neutrality is actually ignorant of the overall situation in the Far East. If the interests that are prepared to be given to Japan are used to assist China instead, it can truly achieve the effective result of stabilizing the Far East.</p>
<p>Second, the slogan of the general reformists in Japan is to join the German-Italian alliance. The Allies' willingness to compromise with Japan is also to prevent Japan from colluding with Germany and Italy. However, if Germany really needs Japan's help, then before Germany compromised with the Soviet Union last year, it must first have obtained the understanding of both Italy and Japan. Japan would never be left out in the cold. At that time, the Japanese military delegation was already on its way, but was dejected and returned due to the establishment of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact. This shows that Germany has seen through Japan's exhaustion and is not enough to be used. Recently, when the European war has reached a serious stage, although a part of the Japanese are extremely arrogant, Germany's attitude has turned cold, and there is no sign of welcoming Japan to join their camp. The Japanese calls are just a posture to threaten the Allies.</p>
<p>Third, to deal with aggressors, one can only use strength to make decisive decisions in a timely manner in order to achieve results. Routine protests and empty condemnations only delay the opportunity and are not taken into consideration by those who deliberately aggress. Hull's condemnation of the bombing of Chongqing was met by Japan demanding the evacuation of foreigners in exchange; while the ban on the export of machinery immediately put pressure on Japan, and it engaged in easing the situation diplomatically. This proves what is an effective method. Moreover, most aggressors take advantage of unpreparedness to break out incidents. Therefore, if the other party's alertness and preparation are not sufficient, they will inevitably be caught off guard and unable to cope. In this European war, the Allies have suffered a lot as a result. To maintain the current situation in the Far East, it is essential that the major powers increase their strength for use and ensure a proactive position.</p>
<p>The difficulties in the European situation may not be improved in a short time, but the Far East has a bright future, and the situation is simpler than in Europe, and the measures are easier than in Europe. It only depends on how the people who grasp this opportunity use it.</p>
<h3 id="e7">US President Replies to French Prime Minister, Resolves Not to Recognize Conquest by Force, Expresses Infinite Admiration for the Heroic Achievements of the French Army, Guarantees Assistance but Not Bound by Military Obligations <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt has assured France that as long as France continues its struggle to defend freedom, the United States will redouble its efforts to aid the Allies with aircraft and military supplies. This guarantee was telegraphed to French Prime Minister Reynaud last night in response to Reynaud's appeal for large numbers of aircraft. Shortly after sending the telegram, President Roosevelt met with the British and French ambassadors. The content of the above telegram is as follows: "I am now replying to your telegram of yesterday. I dare say that you will understand that this telegram has received our most sincere and well-intentioned study. Now, I must first reiterate that the United States, both government and people, pay their infinite admiration to the heroic achievements of the French army in resisting the aggressor in its territory. In addition, I would like to reiterate in the most solemn tone that the US government is making every possible effort under the current circumstances to ensure that the Allied forces have been able to obtain supplies of aircraft, artillery, and various military materials in the past few weeks. As long as the Allied governments continue to resist, the US government will redouble its efforts to provide this assistance. I believe that each week thereafter will see more materials of various kinds being shipped to the Allies. Based on its policy of not recognizing the results of conquest of other people's territories by military aggression, the US government will not recognize as valid any attempt to infringe upon the independence and territorial integrity of France by force. Now, at a time when the French people are heartbroken, I offer you my most sympathetic assurance, and I can continue to assure you that as long as the French continue to defend their freedom, this freedom, which has now become the main reason for all institutions of the world that conform to the popular will, the United States will continuously supply material supplies of increasing quantity and variety. They can rest assured of this. I know that you understand that the above remarks do not contain any military obligations, and only Congress can make such obligations." People here believe that it is impossible for the United States to declare war at present. According to political observers, it is difficult to obtain the approval of Congress at this time, but steps may be taken to adjust various American industries to assist the Allies. After the British and French ambassadors met with President Roosevelt, they solemnly stated to reporters that they had not presented any formal documents to President Roosevelt. When answering a question, French Ambassador Saint-Quentin said that he believed that the Allied military conference would be held regularly in Bordeaux to discuss future plans. (Reuters dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<p>Washington - The British and French ambassadors to Washington held talks with President Roosevelt yesterday for more than an hour. British Ambassador Lord Lothian said after the meeting that the talks "have clarified several things in our minds." (Associated Press dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<p>London - London political circles commented on President Roosevelt's telegram to French Prime Minister Reynaud, saying that the British people were deeply grateful for President Roosevelt's generous response to the French Prime Minister's appeal. It is needless to say that President Roosevelt's assurance that if the Allied governments continued to resist, the United States intended to redouble its efforts to supply aircraft and military supplies, was especially welcomed. The British people fully understand President Roosevelt's explanation that this guarantee did not contain any "military" significance and that "only Congress can make this commitment."

<h3 id="e8">Analysis by British Intelligence of Hitler's Remarks: Contains the Meaning of Threatening Global Freedom; Britain Determined to Fully Defend Maritime Freedom <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>London. Intelligence officer and Member of Parliament Nicolson delivered a radio address last night, providing a detailed analysis of Hitler's conversation with Karl Henry von Wiegand, a correspondent for the International News Service. Nicolson stated that Hitler always presents a bouquet of roses with thorns hidden within. Thus, when he assured America that there was no need to fear Germany, he touched upon the Monroe Doctrine, which made Americans uncomfortable, implying that his promise not to attack America would only be valid if the United States continued to refrain from interfering in European affairs. As for Hitler's stated determination to break British sea power and restore what he calls "freedom of the seas," this is a cunning tactic. Millions of Americans will find it pleasing and comforting. In reality, for nearly 150 years, it has been the British Navy that has maintained maritime freedom and benefited both North and South America. Britain has protected the seas from being disrupted by Napoleon, Bismarck, and the German Emperor and will continue to defend the seas from Hitler. This conversation is of great interest. Hitler's warnings were anticipated. When Hitler decided to annex Czechoslovakia, he did not initially announce his intention to annex the whole of it, only claiming that his actions in Czechoslovakia were merely to slightly adjust the German-Czech border. Today, Hitler maintains the same stance, not announcing any intention to destroy Great Britain, and only stating that what he wants to do to the country is merely to seize its colonies and eliminate some well-known British men and women. His emphasis on freedom of the seas is, in fact, aimed at the surrender of the British Navy. If Hitler were to seize our maritime defenses, we would be as powerless as Czechoslovakia was when it lost its land defenses, having no power at all. If we lose it today, Hitler will be in London tomorrow. Is it necessary for people to pay a shameful price to purchase peace, and will we not be able to enjoy peace? We are determined not to pay a shameful price to buy peace. The glory and security of the world are truly in our hands. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>London. A prominent commentator here, referring to Hitler's recent conversation with International News Service correspondent Wiegand, stated that those familiar with Hitler's past history and tactics will immediately understand the meaning of the threat to global freedom contained in Hitler's words. Hitler's phrases "America for the Americans" and "Europe for the Europeans" have revealed Germany's hope for hegemony and will implement an economic policy detrimental to the countries of the Americas. Considering Hitler's past solemn assurances to Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, and Luxembourg, Hitler's recent statement that he never dreamed of interfering in the Western Hemisphere is more ominous than a harbinger of good fortune. Unfortunately, the reporter asked Hitler about the "Fifth Column" issue. Hitler's denial of responsibility seems laughable to countries that have witnessed or suffered from "Fifth Column" activities. Equally laughable is Nazi Germany's complaint that other countries have failed to treat Nazi spies favorably. In fact, in recent years, Nazi spies have instigated disturbances around the world, and the tolerance shown to these spies and Nazi sympathizers is the reason why every country in the world is facing the danger of "Fifth Column" activities. Regarding Hitler's intentions towards the British Empire, his statements about eliminating figures who would destroy the British Empire and eradicating the plutocracy are tantamount to stating that he intends to wipe out all parties in countries that are united and determined to fight and replace them with puppet Nazi and Fascist governments appointed by him. Hitler's desire to eliminate the so-called British maritime hegemony means that he intends to force Britain to be subject to Hitler's will in maintaining its vital sea lanes. In other words, he intends to reduce Britain to a vassal state, subject to suppression at any time according to Hitler's personal whims. It is quite interesting to compare Hitler's statement that he does not want to smash the British Empire with the declaration made by Propaganda Minister Goebbels in Posen on January 19. Goebbels said, "Germany has only one opinion of Britain, and that is to destroy it." Goebbels also declared to the German people on June 5, "My enemies still refuse peace. The war will be prosecuted to the point of their complete destruction." Finally, Hitler was particularly cautious about declaring his peaceful intentions, because Hitler has never been prepared to put down his instruments of gambling, and he has never clearly stated Germany's wishes. In fact, Germany's "major needs" are inconvenient to define clearly even now, given their limitless nature, and because Hitler will never consider himself satisfied until he has achieved his goal of not only dominating Europe but also the world. Hitler's claim that reason is being restored in various countries means that those countries should be prepared to accept Nazi philosophy and completely submit to Nazi military rule.

<h3 id="e10">Lindbergh Opposes Involvement in War; Attacks the Government Severely <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Washington. Famous aviator Colonel Lindbergh delivered a radio address to the nation today, stating that the countries of the Americas should cooperate to defend the Western Hemisphere and that the government's current policy of "meddling in foreign affairs" is not appropriate. Our immediate priority is to establish a clear national defense plan and work with the countries of the Americas to achieve it. To protect our security, we must establish various military bases in necessary locations, regardless of which country the territory belongs to. Once our defenses are sufficient, foreign troops will have no possibility of invading us. The government's current policies will lead our country into the whirlpool of war. If these policies continue, we will no longer be able to consider ourselves a great nation. Look at our position today. The officials in power have caused us to lose the power that we could have wielded as the world's largest neutral country. We are only selling small quantities of arms to Britain and France, which has little impact on the outcome of the war, and this war cannot be changed by our military strength. Since our founding, we have always demanded that foreign countries not interfere in the affairs of the Western Hemisphere, but we ourselves often interfere in the affairs of other countries. Is this not self-contradictory? What we are doing to Britain and France now is exactly the same as what those countries did to Czechoslovakia, Poland, Finland, and Norway before, namely, encouraging those countries and hoping that we will provide impossible assistance. The lesson is not far off. If we do not know how to change our ways, will we not be missing a major opportunity? Furthermore, the matter of our country sending troops to participate in the war is out of the question. Even if we want to send a small number of troops, it will take considerable time to train them. Far water cannot quench a nearby fire. Moreover, after our country enters the war, our position will change, and there will be various problems to deal with. In short, we must clearly recognize the current facts, even if we do not welcome these facts. The fact is that before we take effective action in the European war, German troops may have already controlled the entire Europe. In that case, Europe will be controlled by a powerful military state unlike any other in history, and the population it controls will soon be larger than our country. Today, American citizens are at the crossroads of war and peace. Are we, as the world's powerful nation, going to let the independent destiny created by our ancestors' sacrifice of life flow into the East, or are we willing to be dragged into the endless wars of the Old Continent and be unable to extricate ourselves, or are we going to strengthen our own defenses and let the European countries deal with the European war themselves? Which way to go awaits our decisive decision. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e11">Sketches of Paris Under the Nazi Boot: Filled with Desolation, Like a Dead City <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Paris. The reporter flew from Berlin on Friday evening and arrived here, only to see that this prosperous French capital had completely changed its appearance and become a dead city. The Nazi swastika flag flies over the Arc de Triomphe, the Eiffel Tower, the Hotel Ville, and other locations in Paris. Most of the people here fled in panic as German troops approached the gates of Paris. According to estimates by the Paris police, the number of residents who have left the city and fled elsewhere has reached ten percent. In the lush forests surrounding Paris, many refugees have been hiding. Only yesterday did they return to Paris under the German boot. As the German troops marched triumphantly into the city, a small number of people who remained in the city and had not left gathered at the doors of their homes or on the roadsides to watch the arrival of the victorious army. It is said that German leader Hitler will also come here in a few days, but it is not known whether he will inspect the troops after his arrival. When the reporter arrived here at eight o'clock on Friday night, the American flag was still flying high on the roof of the embassy. It is believed that the ambassador to France must still be in the city. Military officials said that dozens of German soldiers arrived here yesterday, and German soldiers continue to arrive. German sentries in gray uniforms are stationed in front of various buildings occupied by German military institutions. The reporter witnessed Mr. Russel following the officers of the German General Headquarters, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Propaganda to this place. Our group consisted of ten foreign reporters, including three American reporters. I am one of the members of this group. We arrived here within ten hours after the Germans entered the city. The first team of German soldiers entered the city very quietly and orderly. At nine o'clock in the evening, they ordered all residents to turn off their lights, and the entire city became dark and silent. The sounds of the German soldiers' boots could be heard incessantly. Looking back, everything was desolate. The sounds of newspaper vendors shouting were no longer heard, and there were no more scenes of people drinking happily in restaurants. All the famous French restaurants, theaters, bars, and most hotels were closed. (United Press, 16th)</p>

<p>Rome. An official Italian army communiqué stated that Italian forces continued reconnaissance on the Alpine border, which the enemy tried to hinder without success, and was captured by Italian forces. One person and lost automatic weapons. Naval and air forces continued operations in the Mediterranean. Italian destroyers sank an enemy submarine. The Italian Air Force bombed French air force bases and port facilities in Corsica, and bombed the ordnance factories of Malta, Brindisi, and Mola. Seventy Italian fighter planes launched a large-scale and daring attack on Rennes, La Motte, and other places in southern France. During the fierce battle between the planes, Italian planes destroyed forty enemy planes and several planes on the ground. A large armory was destroyed, and several fires broke out. Five Italian planes were lost. The offensive against British forces in North Africa is ongoing. The British forces, aided by a large number of tanks, attempted to attack towards Sidi Azzaz. In East Africa, a squadron of Italian planes attacked the air force bases of Berbera and Mandera. Two British planes attempted to attack Mayunwa and were shot down. On the night of June 15, enemy planes made ordinary attacks in the skies over mainland Italy. Several bombs fell on Genoa, killing and injuring several civilians. Land suffered only minor damage. Italian anti-aircraft guns shot down four enemy planes. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Rome. Yesterday was the fifth day after Italy entered the war, celebrating the first victory of the Italian Navy, namely, an Italian destroyer of 967 tons fought alone with four French destroyers and sank a French destroyer twice its tonnage. The Italian ship's name is "Calatafimi." Calatafimi is a place name located in Sicily. On May 15, 1860, 1,000 Italian volunteers on the island defeated General Landi, greatly influencing the Sardinian campaign. Its victory can be regarded as the preliminary stage of the last victory of Italy at that time. Therefore, the victory of the Calatafimi is generally regarded as an auspicious sign of this war. As for the name of the French destroyer that was sunk, the official has not yet announced it. What is known is that the ship is a "Dalto" type, built in 1932, with a tonnage of 2,441 tons, equipped with five 13.8 cm cannons, four 13 cm cannons, several anti-aircraft guns, and six torpedo tubes. The Italian ship was commanded by a young captain named Bellinor, born in 1906. (Telecommunications, 16th)</p>

<p>Chongqing. This afternoon, Japanese bombers attacked Chongqing again in four waves. The bombing lasted for about two hours and caused several fires. The Chongqing Hotel, where all foreigners resided, was destroyed by three bombs. All foreign tourists took refuge in the nearby air-raid shelters and were not injured. The first alarm was issued shortly after noon. An hour later, the first batch of 36 Japanese planes dropped bombs on the lower city of Chongqing. Incendiary bombs caused a large fire, which spread rapidly and was extinguished after three hours. A team of Chinese fighter planes fought fiercely with the Japanese planes. An hour later, three more batches of Japanese bombers bombed the western suburbs of Chongqing. The Chinese anti-aircraft gun teams opened fire and bombarded them fiercely. Chinese fighter planes also took off to intercept them. The alarm was lifted at 3:30 p.m. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Chongqing. At 3:00 p.m. today, Chongqing suffered another extremely serious and brutal air raid. 150 Japanese planes dropped more than 800 large bombs in the skies over Chongqing, both inside the old-style brick city and outside the modern city of Chongqing, destroying more than 3,000 houses. It is heard that the casualties in this air raid were very small, because many residents had been evacuated to other places two weeks ago. Many new-style government buildings were destroyed in today's air raid. The famous Chongqing Hotel, where most foreigners and journalists lived, has now been completely destroyed. The old-style brick city has suffered two bombings in four days, and the losses have been very heavy. Entire streets and entire residential areas have been completely changed, turning tall buildings into rubble. No less than 2,000 buildings in the city have been burned down. Many parts of Chongqing are still on fire, especially near the foreign hotels. The water pipes have been broken, so the intense fire cannot be contained. The air-raid alarm was issued at noon, giving the local people two hours to calmly take refuge in air-raid shelters or other suitable places. After the alarm was lifted, the Chongqing air-raid authorities prohibited people from approaching their destroyed homes, because they feared that some of the bombs dropped by the Japanese planes might not have exploded and could cause another accident. The streets of Chongqing are full of ruins and rubble, and there are bomb craters everywhere, so firefighters and paramedics can hardly do their work. In the last air raid, Japanese planes dropped more than 150 bombs and incendiary bombs, which have already destroyed many parts of the city. This bombing was even more fierce than the last one.

<p>Chongqing. A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission said that the war this week was still the most intense in central Hubei. The Chinese army implemented its plan step by step, achieving glorious results. Now the Japanese west of the Xiang River are staggering between Dangyang and Yichang, and Yichang is in the Chinese encirclement. The time for its complete annihilation is imminent. In other war zones, the Chinese army is also actively attacking the Japanese, causing the Japanese army to collapse day by day. The important war results of this week are briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>Henan and Hubei</p>
<p>Since the Japanese invaded Xiangyang last week and were defeated by the Chinese, with thousands killed, they again crossed the river on the Han-Yi Road front and invaded westward. In order to achieve the annihilation of the main force of the entire Japanese army in that direction, the Chinese army resisted step by step, killing seven or eight thousand Japanese soldiers, and gradually lured the Japanese deep into the encirclement. At the same time, the large army that had turned to the rear of the Japanese army pressed towards the Japanese from all directions, first clearing the remaining Japanese north of Jingmen and Dangyang, and in one fell swoop recapturing Yuan'an, killing more than a thousand Japanese soldiers and capturing more than 300 horses, hundreds of rifles, more than 120 mountain gun shells, more than 80 pairs of rifle bullets, and more than 3,000 meters of rice. The Japanese are now surrounded by the Chinese in the mountainous area west of Dangyang, making it difficult to advance or retreat. The Chinese army has also dispatched extremely rapid and capable troops to control all the crossings along the Xiang River and take the opportunity to attack Jiangling and Shashi, and another unit of soldiers has directly attacked Hanyang, further cutting off the Japanese rear. By noon on the 14th, the Chinese army had completed a certain objective action, and the encirclement and annihilation campaign in western Xiangyang was about to unfold gradually under extremely favorable conditions. Near Xinyang in southern Henan, there were also fierce battles between Chinese and Japanese forces on the 7th, killing more than 200 Japanese soldiers. At the same time, the puppet troops Wang Xiangfa, Sun Dajing, and He Laoba led more than 2,000 troops to revolt one after another, thwarting the Japanese attempt to "use Chinese to control Chinese."</p>
<p>Guangdong and Guangxi</p>
<p>The Chinese army in southern Guangdong chased after the Japanese and pressed straight to Jiekou. The Japanese reinforced and counterattacked the Chinese units at Yi Feng Yuan, Guantian, Guancun, Ji Du Qiao, Xian County Gang, and other places. After the Chinese army bravely charged and killed four Japanese officers, including Lieutenant Colonel Brigade Commander Rie Haruto Kizo Nakamuteng, and more than ten other officers and soldiers, including Ozaki Masa, all of whom are continuing their advance.

<h3 id="e25">Large-Scale Scuffle in the Outskirts of Shantou; Japanese Troops Attempt to Cross the Tuojiang River to Invade Guanbu; Chinese Troops Launch Attacks on Shantou from Multiple Routes <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: After the city of Chaozhou was besieged by Chinese troops, the Japanese forces, though holding fast to their strongholds, were subjected to east-west assaults along the railway line by the Chinese, who gained the initiative. Consequently, the Japanese were unable to extend their reach towards Jieyang and Chenghai. On May 13th, the Japanese launched an attack from Fuyang, striking the Qingma Mountain, Lianhu, and Baishui areas bordering Anjie Road, charging as far as the outskirts of Yu’e City, where they were annihilated by the Chinese Chen Regiment. The Japanese then resorted to artillery bombardment of Jieyang, Xigang, Guigang, and Dengtang City. The Chinese Wu Regiment launched flanking attacks from Guxiang, Linmapo, and Aoling Mountain, even storming into Chao'an Chuncheng Tower. As a result, the Japanese forces in Chao'an, after repeated unsuccessful attempts to break out, could only hold their ground in the Chihu, Matuanxiasi, and Fengxi areas in the southwestern suburbs. The Chinese special operations Wang Regiment then launched night attacks on Yinhu, Caitang, and Huamei on the 15th, 16th, and 17th, achieving a major victory, and together with the Gu Regiment of Sangpu Mountain, formed a united front, gradually closing in on the outskirts of Shantou City. Currently, a semicircular encirclement line has been completed from Guanshan Township outside Chenghai City, via Anbu, to Pengzhousuo and Tuopu City, only eight miles from Shantou City. Transportation from Chao'an to Shantou has also been cut off by guerrilla forces, causing great panic among the Japanese and their puppets. The Japanese army opened fire indiscriminately from the East Gate of Chenghai City. On the 17th, they dispatched 200 artillery soldiers, traveling by motorboat to cross the Dongxi River, a tributary of the Han River, and invaded villages in the Chengyanggang area. Various local militias fought back for two hours, causing over 50 casualties to the Japanese and their puppets, who fled back to Chenghai City in disarray. However, the villages along the Dongxi River suffered greatly from the Japanese troops' devastation, incurring significant losses. The Chinese troops then pursued their advantage, crossing the Lianyang River to attack the city. At dawn on the 18th, 300 Japanese and puppet soldiers launched two-pronged attacks: one from Beidou directly towards Longtian, harassing Beilong Huafu; and the other from Ximen, exiting Fenghuakeng, ostensibly searching for guerrillas but in reality looting from the civilians along the way and arresting over 100 able-bodied men. The people closed the gates of their villages and rose up in resistance, resulting in a melee that lasted three hours. Fortunately, the arrested men were rescued, and the Japanese and puppet soldiers suffered dozens of casualties. Those who harassed Guanshan Township were also defeated by the militia and fled in disarray back to Chenghai City. From the 19th onward, Chinese militia teams gathered from all directions like ants, each closing the gates of their villages, not allowing outsiders to enter, thus severing transportation between Shantou and Chenghai. That morning, the sound of gunfire suddenly erupted outside Shantou City, causing shops in the city not to dare open for business. It was reported that large numbers of Chinese troops had arrived on Sangpu Mountain, and Japanese planes continuously flew over for reconnaissance. Shantou and Anbu jointly dispatched 400 to 500 Japanese soldiers to meet the enemy below Sangpu Mountain. Six miles from Shantou City, they encountered the Chinese Gu Regiment, and a fierce battle broke out at Pengzhousuo and Zhuanglong Mountain at 10:00 AM on the 19th. Anbu, where the Japanese Eastern Route Commander Horino was stationed, had its headquarters in Guanlutou, and fortified artillery positions had been built nearby on Panlong Mountain and Wuta Gang. Pengzhou and Zhuanglong, three miles from Anbu, were heavily bombarded by Japanese artillery, with nearly 1,000 shells fired. The sound of the shelling could be heard in Shantou City. The Gu Regiment, suppressed by the artillery fire, retreated back to Sangpu Mountain. Five to six hundred Japanese and puppet troops pursued them to Pengzhousuo and Tuopu City, hastily building artillery positions and opening fire on Guanbu across the river. They collected thirty to forty fishing boats and sampans, and the Japanese shallow-water warships in Shantou sailed to the mouth of the Tuojiang River, intending to provide cover for the Japanese troops crossing the river to attack Guanbu. Guanbu belongs to Chaoyang County and could bypass Guiyu Bridge and enter Puning Lihu, attaching to the rear of Jieyang Mianhu. At 3:00 PM on the 19th, Chinese reinforcements arrived and launched a fierce counterattack on Tuopu, engaging in a fierce battle for three hours. The Japanese and puppet troops suffered over 100 casualties. As dusk approached, the Japanese dared not cross the river, and the remnants fled towards Anbu Panlong Mountain. That evening, Chinese troops dispersed into several routes, penetrating deep into the suburbs of the city, building countless "plum blossom" earth dugouts. Soldiers hid in the hollows, firing cold shots to challenge the Japanese troops in Shantou and Anbu. Gunfire was heard everywhere, but no one could be seen. Transportation between Shantou and Anbu was completely cut off. Every night, Chinese troops formed teams to attack Japanese strongholds. This has been going on for three days and nights, and the outskirts of Shantou City have fallen into a state of chaos.</p>

<p>Yong'an Dispatch: Fujian Province is mountainous, so the culture of this province has always been concentrated in several coastal cities. The population of the province in the ninth year of the Daoguang era of the Qing Dynasty was over 17 million. According to the survey in the 24th year of the Republic of China, it was only over 12 million. Although there are many reasons for the recent decrease in the population of this province, the unsanitary housing conditions and the prevalence of epidemics everywhere have a great impact on the health of the people. Since the War of Resistance, the provincial government has paid great attention to the people's</p>
<p>housing problem</p>
<p>in order to disperse the coastal population, develop inland resources, and complete the economic construction of the province. The Fujian Provincial Bank, in order to assist in construction and improve housing problems throughout the province, has built a total of eight new villages inside and outside Yong'an City, where the provincial capital is located, all of which have been built in places with beautiful environments and scenery. As for the internal equipment, it only seeks to be economical and beautiful. Among them, four have been completed and rented out, and others are underway in Nanping, Sanyuan, Sha County and other places. The Fujian Provincial Bank has another important purpose in building new villages, which is to seek balanced development between rural villages and cities, to make cities pastoral and pastoral areas urban. This is not only sufficient to prevent enemy aircraft from bombing during wartime, but also serves as a model for the people when the government is currently promoting the new county system and implementing local autonomy. It is reported that the bank is based on the economic principles of social undertakings, taking into account the</p>
<p>situation of new villages</p>
<p>around the world and issuing real estate investment certificates, divided into two types: National Currency, one yuan and one hundred yuan, with a term of five years, guaranteed by the bank to protect the principal and interest, allowing the public to purchase and freely transfer them. Certificate holders may also inherit real estate equivalent to the value of the bank's investment in real estate. Before the principal is due, dividends can be distributed. This measure can enable "residents" to have their own "houses," and people have the benefits of real estate without the stagnation of funds, which can be said to be a gain in many ways.</p>
<h3 id="e27">The Japanese Side Fails to Win Over Overseas Chinese <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: In order to disperse China's resistance forces, the Japanese side has been trying its best to seduce overseas Chinese to betray their motherland. For the past two years, they have designed various methods, but they have been seen through by the overseas Chinese and have failed. The Japanese agency in Fujian that seduces overseas Chinese is the South China Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board in Xiamen. Therefore, Xiamen can also be said to be the central location for seducing overseas Chinese in Fujian Province. Its work can be divided into two stages. The first stage was to use strong-arm tactics, block the sea ports, concentrate the entry and exit of overseas Chinese in Gulangyu, confiscate the property of anti-Japanese overseas Chinese in Xiamen City, bombard the Tong'an Jimei School run by Chen Jiageng, and bomb Xiamen University in Changting, as revenge for Chen's leadership of overseas Chinese in Nanyang to engage in the patriotic movement, hoping to threaten the overseas Chinese and soften them. However, the overseas Chinese are very determined. Although the entrances and exits have been blocked, they would rather go through Shanghai than through Xiamen. As for the confiscation of property, they all believe that they can be fully recovered when the War of Resistance is successful, otherwise they will be occupied by the Japanese and Taiwanese. The bombing by aircraft and the bombardment by warships only increased their indignation. At the same time, when the Japanese saw that overseas Chinese in various places in Nanyang were enthusiastically purchasing legal tender from the Bank of China and the Overseas Chinese Bank, they also transported the legal tender they had plundered in the occupied areas to Nanyang to sell it in the hope of exchanging it for foreign currency, which was also discovered and rejected by the overseas Chinese. Therefore, the strong-arm tactics used by the Japanese side completely failed. The second stage was to use gentle tactics, setting up a puppet Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau in Xiamen, appointing the fatuous and old Chen Kewei as the puppet director, setting up an Overseas Chinese Reception Center in Gulangyu, organizing a puppet Overseas Chinese Association in Hong Kong, and sending traitors Hong Lixun and Huang Lianfang to Nanyang to persuade overseas Chinese, vainly hoping that overseas Chinese would participate in puppet organizations. The Osaka Economic Inspection Group sent Nakata Morio, Ishii Soitsu, and Komatsu Genmao to Xiamen to form the Xiamen Construction Company, absorbing overseas Chinese funds to supply their occupation of Xiamen's industry and commerce. However, the overseas Chinese already knew their scam and no one responded. Hong Lixun and Huang Lianfang were successively shot and killed in Gulangyu. Therefore, the gentle tactics used by the Japanese side also completely failed. Now, because the Chinese army has won victories in all battles on the various battlefields, the Xiamen Japanese and puppet newspapers rarely publish war reports. They only promote the peace movement, hoping to deceive the public, which also shows that their efforts are becoming increasingly futile.</p>

<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: The pirate leader Yu A'huang in eastern Fujian, under the command of the Japanese, led a thousand pirates, rampaging on the sea, appearing and disappearing between Meizhou and Pingtan Islands, intercepting merchants and travelers without any scruples. The Japanese also used them to harass the coast, calling them the "Naval Guerrilla Team." After the Chinese army launched an expedition to suppress them, they disintegrated. Yu was hit by a bullet and went to Xiamen to heal his wounds, but soon died of serious injuries. The remnants, led by Weng Shanggong and Wang Fuming, two groups, quarreled over the unequal distribution of spoils and were incompatible. However, their strength was almost completely lost, and they did not dare to disturb the southeastern coast of eastern Fujian under the control of the Chinese army. In late last month, they led the remnants, took separate sailboats to escape to Xiamen. On the way, they fought again. At a distance of dozens of meters, they threw grenades at each other. The Wang bandits were inferior in manpower and equipment, and suffered heavier casualties. During the melee, Wang suddenly disappeared. It is said that he was hit by a bullet and fell into the sea. After Weng arrived in Xiamen, he was detained by the Japanese. It is also expected that the bandits will end up like this after doing so much evil.</p>
<p>Lan Rubo, the local emperor who previously dominated the Shima area, has since been executed. His seventh prince, Lan Buqing, who had transformed from the Three Dots Zeng bandit into a scourge to the country, led more than 300 pirates a month ago from Jianjiangkou Baiquanyang and stationed in Heshan, Xiamen, under the command of Lin Chun. Import and export ships in southern Fujian all load and unload goods outside Quanzhou Port, which aroused the attention of the Japanese. A few days ago, the British Yongli ship carried passengers and goods from Shanghai to Quanzhou. After the passengers disembarked, while the ship was unloading goods, a Japanese warship suddenly followed and immediately lowered the dinghy to chase and rob the ship. At that time, more than 20 barges were prepared to load goods onto the ship, and three of them were already full of goods. When they saw the Japanese boat chasing, they hurriedly sailed into the port. However, because they were heavily loaded and moved slowly, they could not escape and were intercepted and taken away, resulting in a loss of more than 200,000 yuan. According to investigations, the Yongli ship carried a total of 12,374 pieces of goods to Quanzhou this time, including 4,450 pieces of fertilizer powder, 3,900 pieces of soybean cake, 2,500 pieces of wheat bran, and 286 pieces of cloth. The others were cotton yarn, medicinal materials, etc. The goods unloaded onto the barges that were burned and robbed were 324 pieces of fertilizer powder, 615 pieces of wheat bran, 30 pieces of casehead cloth, 4 pieces of cotton yarn, and 3 pieces of medicinal herbs. However, it is not yet known how many people were on board. The British Xinyangtai ship also transported goods from Shanghai to Quanzhou the next day. Knowing that the Yongli ship had been burned and robbed, it immediately sailed away.</p>

<p>Soviet Union Announces the Truth about the Dispute</p>
<p>Moscow: The dispute between the Soviet Union and Lithuania has been resolved. The truth and details are now announced here as follows:</p>
<p>"On June 14th, Soviet People's Commissar Molotov, on behalf of the Soviet government, sent a protest to Lithuanian Foreign Minister Urbšys (who is currently staying in Moscow), to be forwarded to the Lithuanian government. The protest stated: 'As a result of the recent exchange of views between Molotov and Urbšys in Moscow, the Soviet government believes that the following facts are very clear: (1) In recent months, incidents of kidnapping Red Army personnel have occurred in Lithuania. They have been subjected to cruel torture and forced to disclose military secrets (the Soviet troops stationed in Lithuanian territory are in accordance with the Mutual Assistance Treaty between the two countries). Red Army personnel Butaev was not only kidnapped, but also assassinated by the Lithuanian police after the Soviet government requested his release. As for Soviet soldiers Pisarev and Shamava Ganots, they were lucky enough to escape after being cruelly tortured by the Lithuanian police, but Soviet soldier Sutov has not been found. The Lithuanian authorities' actions are nothing more than trying to prevent the Red Army from staying in Lithuania. In addition, recently, Soviet employees (such as laundresses, cooks, etc.) have been expelled or sent to concentration camps, and workers who built barracks for the Soviet army have also been arrested. This illegal action against the Lithuanian people not only prevents the Red Army from staying in Lithuania, but also causes hostility towards the Soviet army, preparing to attack the Red Army stationed in Lithuania. The above facts prove that the Lithuanian government has violated the Soviet-Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty and is preparing to attack all Red Army personnel stationed in Lithuania in accordance with the Mutual Assistance Treaty. (2) After the Lithuanian government and the Soviet Union concluded the Mutual Assistance Treaty, it formed a military alliance with Latvia and Estonia, thereby changing the so-called Baltic Little Entente into a three-nation alliance. The Soviet government has determined that this alliance is directed against the Soviet Union. Since Lithuania joined the alliance, the secret consultations between the staff officers of the three countries have become more frequent. In February 1940, this military alliance even published a 'Baltic Review,' which was printed in English, French, and German. The above facts prove that the Lithuanian government has violated the Soviet-Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty, because according to Article 6 of the treaty, neither party may join an alliance directed against the other. Such actions in violation of the Mutual Assistance Treaty and the extreme hostility of the Lithuanian government towards the Soviet Union are contrary to the Soviet Union's pro-Lithuanian policy. For example, the Soviet Union would automatically transfer Vilnius and the Vilnius region to Lithuania.</p>
<p>Three Requests Made to Lithuania</p>
<p>The Soviet government believes that the current situation has changed, and Lithuania must implement the following conditions: (1) Lithuanian Interior Minister Skarga and Political Police Minister Povlaitis, who are in charge of anti-Soviet actions, should be impeached immediately. (2) Lithuania should immediately form a government that can abide by the Mutual Assistance Treaty and suppress all those who oppose the treaty. (3) Soviet troops must be stationed at various important points in numbers sufficient to maintain the implementation of the Mutual Assistance Treaty and to deal with all provocative actions. The Soviet government believes that these requirements are the minimum requirements and must be implemented, otherwise the Soviet-Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty will never be effective. The Soviet side expects the Lithuanian government to reply before 10:00 AM on June 15th, otherwise the Soviet government will consider the request to have been rejected. At 9:00 AM yesterday, Urbšys gave a reply to Molotov, stating that the Lithuanian government had completely accepted the requests made by the Soviet government. (TASS Dispatch on the 16th)</p>

New Caledonia has important interests for Japanese residents in the operation of nickel and iron. The Japanese now expect France to make peace separately and are openly discussing the distribution of French colonies.</p>
<p>Building Fortifications on Mandated Islands</p>
<p>An American named Granger writes in Asia magazine that the Japanese have been deliberately operating the international mandated islands in the Pacific in recent years, hoping to use them as a base for their southern advance when international winds become tense, threatening the territories and interests of Britain and France in the South Pacific. The article points out that in the past five years, the Japanese have worked hard to develop air transport on the above-mentioned islands. First, they implemented the opening of air routes to Japan. All the detailed weather conditions and air currents around the islands are under Japanese control. Recently, the Japanese have also planned to open air routes to Australia and New Guinea. The facilities of the seaports and airfields built by the Japanese on the various islands are so large in scale that they have aroused the suspicion of the International Mandated Territories Committee. According to investigations, the Japanese have violated international regulations and have indeed built fortifications on the islands. Australians firmly believe that Truk in the Caroline Islands and Joroit in the Marshall Islands have indeed been fortified, but there is no definite evidence to confirm this. The article concludes that the Japanese are using these islands to defend Japan's position in East Asia, to invade America's defense money, to the south to Australia and New Zealand, and to the east to British, French, and Dutch territories. If war breaks out, the Japanese can also cut off the connection between the United States and the Philippines and Malaya. The threat to the interests of national countries in the South Pacific can be imagined.</p>
<p>China Review Weekly Urges Britain to Be Aware</p>
<p>The China Review Weekly recently commented on Britain's Far Eastern policy, saying, "The Japanese are using the pretext of maintaining the status quo of the Dutch East Indies, but they have other ambitions. This can be clearly seen from Arita's speech at the Tokyo Pacific Conference on the 3rd of this month. According to Arita, 'If the great powers refuse to participate in the economic development of the Dutch East Indies, then a conflict between Japan and the Western countries will be unavoidable.' Although Arita's speech repeatedly mentioned the Dutch East Indies, he did not make a clear distinction with the Hainan area. What he meant actually included the locations of British, American, and French interests in the Far East. His intention was no different from issuing a warning to Britain, France, and the United States. Japan will occupy these areas by force, just as it has invaded China.</p>
<p>British and French Territories Are Surrounded by Crises</p>
<p>The Japanese have also concentrated naval forces on the southern coast of China N Hainan Island to threaten the South Seas territories of Britain, France, and the United States. Observing the United States's stern attitude towards Japan, we can believe that the Japanese may not suddenly use force against the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines, but observing that Britain and France are in the midst of fierce battles with Germany and have no time to look east, the Far Eastern territories of France and Britain are likely to be attacked by the Japanese navy at any time, satisfying their greed. If the Japanese did not fall so deeply into the quagmire in China, the Japanese would have invaded Hong Kong and Annam long ago.</p>
<p>If Tolerance Continues, They Will Suffer the Consequences</p>
<p>Therefore, what the Japanese are most anxious and urgently trying to end is the war against China. According to reliable reports, along with the news of the Japanese navy gathering on Hainan Island, the Japanese central government has already begun its so-called "Far Eastern Issue" negotiations, and the Japanese are threatening Britain and France to force them to agree to end the "China Incident," creating an Eastern Munich Conference. This report has aroused the surprise of Chinese officials, who have instructed the Chinese Ambassador to Britain to lodge a serious protest with the British government. The British side may, because of the pressure from the Germans in Europe, try to compromise and preserve its Far Eastern territories. This view is completely wrong. It must be known that the Japanese are difficult to satisfy. If Britain and France satisfy their desires, Japan will go even further and brazenly seize the Far Eastern interests of Britain, France, and the United States.</p>
<p>The European and Asian Wars of Resistance Have the Same Goal</p>
<p>Even more, what Britain and France are currently craving is the help of the United States, and their goal in fighting Germany is also clear, saying that it is "to maintain democracy and liberate Europe from the yoke of Germany." However, China's heroic resistance in Asia also has the same meaning, and the Japanese "New Order in East Asia" and the German "New Order" are no different. Therefore, Britain, France, and China should be in the same camp to fight against violence and defeat those ambitious people in mankind.</p>
<p>The United States Should Assert Something Urgently</p>
<p>Looking back on the past, when the United States sought the assistance of Britain and France to maintain peace in the East, it was always rejected by Britain and France. Now that Britain and France are in a position in Europe like China, they hope for the assistance of the United States again. Therefore, the United States has the right to propose to Britain and France at this time not to compromise with Japan and create an Eastern Munich Conference. The establishment of the Japanese "New Order in East Asia" is not only very unfavorable to China, but also a major blow to the Far Eastern interests of the United States. The establishment of democracy in Europe is in the life-and-death struggle of Britain and France, but the war in Asia and the war in Europe are inseparably related.</p>
<p>Britain Should Not Be Afraid of the Far East</p>
<p>China has been fighting for freedom and justice for three years, and victory is in sight. People all over the world are giving it sympathy, but China's enemies are being supplied with the raw materials they need for war by various countries, and this contradictory behavior is especially evident in the United States. However, under such circumstances, China's fighting strength is stronger and its determination to resist the enemy is stronger. Its spirit is truly amazing. After the reorganization of the British cabinet, there is generally no fear of the war in Europe. We sincerely hope that the British government will not be threatened by the Japanese and be afraid of the Far East. In this way, the Allied forces will have firm confidence, American sympathy can be deepened, and the Chinese people also look forward to it. Prime Minister Churchill should urgently clarify Britain's Far Eastern policy to dispel outside doubts about Britain. At the same time, he should actively cooperate with the United States to maintain peace in the Hainan area of China and shatter the Japanese dream.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Various Circles in Shanghai Commemorated Yesterday the Martyrdom of the Premier in Guangzhou; Resolved to Emulate the National Father's Spirit of Steadfastness and Unyielding; Determine Conviction to Complete the Great Undertaking of Resistance and Construction <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the 18th anniversary of the National Father's martyrdom in Guangzhou. According to central regulations, it is combined with the London martyrdom commemoration on October 11 and held at the same time as the Premier's first uprising commemoration on September 9. Therefore, no ceremonies were held in the city yesterday, but in order to commemorate the National Father's steadfast, unyielding, and arduous struggle and his lofty and great personality, citizens from all walks of life mostly used a calm attitude to make a spiritual commemoration. It is also at a time of extraordinary circumstances, the European war is expanding, and those who attempt to undermine the war of resistance and endanger the nation have a similar environment to that of the National Father's martyrdom eighteen years ago. Therefore, in order to overcome hardships and overcome difficulties, we must unanimously emulate the National Father's great spirit and, under the leadership of the President, pledge to firmly believe in, support national policies, strive for final victory, and complete the great undertaking of national construction.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Father Jacquinot Grieves for National Tribulations; Quietly Boards a Ship to Leave Shanghai; Reluctantly Bids Farewell to the Nanshi Refugee Zone; Hastens Back to France to Dedicate Himself to Comforting Refugees; He Longs for People in Shanghai to Treat the Departure Area Well <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Father Jacquinot de Besange, the person in charge of the Nanshi Refugee Zone, suddenly boarded a ship and left Shanghai to return to his country yesterday. Prior to this, no one in various circles knew about it. Even those close to Father Jacquinot did not know that Father Jacquinot had suddenly left. Because yesterday morning Father Jacquinot was still holding mass at the Catholic Church, after a reporter from the Social News Agency learned the news that Father Jacquinot was about to return to his country, they rushed to catch up and saw this white-haired, kind, and amiable French elder. He told them the distress of suddenly leaving Shanghai to return to his country and made a brief talk at the pier.</p>
<p>Missing the Motherland</p>
<p>According to the conversation, the unfortunate fall of Paris and the retreat of the French army and the fleeing of compatriots from the motherland, how can I not be moved? After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, I have repeatedly seen the pain suffered by the Chinese people and the tragedy of families being destroyed and people being killed. Therefore, I have to reluctantly leave this second hometown and hasten back to my country, temporarily bidding farewell to tens of thousands of beloved refugees in Nanshi. This trip will take the route of North America and then return to the country. I will still devote myself to comforting the refugees. After returning to the Nanshi refugee area, a follow-up committee has now been organized to take charge. Although the number of refugees in the current refugee area has decreased, the funding is still extremely tight. Therefore, it is planned to disperse the young and strong. The survey has been completed.</p>
<p>Concern for the Refugees</p>
<p>We are waiting to discuss the schedule for sending them away. Now it has been decided to issue half a month's rations to each person to temporarily maintain them. After that, they can only make a living on their own. It has also been agreed to provide for the elderly and weak in the Xin Pu Yu Hall. I did not want to ignore the lives of tens of thousands of refugees and suddenly leave, and I could not bear to abandon the hard-earned refugee area without completing the task. It is because the flames of war in the motherland burn in my heart. I hope everyone will appreciate this. What I hope is that the Nanshi refugee area can continue to exist. There are no shortage of philanthropists in Shanghai who will continue to treat it well and provide assistance and relief. Then, even though I am in Western Europe, my heart will be comforted. He couldn't help but sob, and the reporter was also silent.</p>
<p>French僑s' Impressions</p>
<p>According to the French Shanghai Daily, the French residents of this port knew several days ago that the fall of Paris was inevitable, but they still had a glimmer of hope. When the death knell of the fall finally rang, it suddenly made the French residents recall this beautiful capital, all of which they had passed or strolled through, and they all felt deeply saddened. It is noted that the fall of Paris this time is especially reminiscent of the situation when the German army entered Paris on March 1, 1871. The French Shanghai Daily stopped its commentary for a day yesterday to express its condolences for the loss of Paris.</p>
<p>Chinese Staff Contribute Funds</p>
<p>The Chinese staff of the French Concession Board of Directors donated large sums of money to fund French operations. It is recorded that the Chinese staff of the French Concession Fire Brigade donated 562 yuan, 8 jiao, and 2 fen; more than 10 public works staff on Xue Huali Road donated 127 yuan; the Chinese staff of the French Concession Board of Directors General Office and Printing Room donated 250 yuan; the purchasing staff and tax offices and financial office of the French Concession Board of Directors donated 1,000 yuan; and the Chinese staff of the French Concession Classified Business Office donated 57 yuan, 4 jiao, and 1 fen.</p>
<p>British Send Money</p>
<p>The British War Fund Raising Committee in this city held a meeting on the 14th at the committee's office at No. 27 The Bund. British Consul Layber, Atkinson, Burras, Bowden, Woodhead, Sir Marshall, Dr. Kennett, and the committee's chief accountant Stitcher and secretary Crawford were all present at the meeting. Burras resigned from his position as a fundraising committee member due to his imminent departure. Crawford</p>
<p>Volunteered</p>
<p>, Willing to succeed him, and was approved by the General Assembly. Then, the committee's chief accountant Stitcher announced the total amount of donations. As of the 13th of this month, a total of 858,116 yuan, 8 jiao, and 6 fen in French currency and 15,601.1 pounds in British currency had been received. It was also announced that the funds donated in the past six months had been remitted back to the motherland to be used as funds for the British Red Cross, comforting soldiers, and the Navy. its</p>
<p>Distribution Situation</p>
<p>The following: 3,300 pounds were used for the British Red Cross, and 6 ambulances for wounded soldiers were designated to be purchased. 3,200 pounds were used for comforting soldiers, and 500 pounds were used for the Navy. According to the committee, there is still a great shortage of ambulances at the front line, and each ambulance costs 550 pounds. Therefore, it is hoped that the British in this port will continue to donate enthusiastically to help the motherland in the war.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Dishonest Pricing of Goods; Written Warning Issued; Rice Price Rise Is Surprisingly Alarming <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The continuous rise in prices in this port is a serious problem for society and people's livelihoods. The majority of wage earners cannot even afford to feed their families with their hard-earned wages. As a result, strikes are spreading and theft cases are increasing, which is a cause for deep concern for the future of security in the concession. A reporter from Pingming News has learned from reliable sources that the Public Works Department is very concerned about the price issue in the concession. Recently, a large number of people from the department's health department have been sent to first investigate the cost of various necessities and the sales price of the stores to see if it exceeds their</p>
<p>Entitled Profits</p>
<p>In addition, those who are not truthful in pricing, or who have not fully marked the prices of the goods, have been warned by the Public Works Department, followed by fines. The department does not want to publish the business names and companies that have been issued written warnings, but it is heard that a certain large department store has been fined, and another large department store is also on the list of written warnings. Rice is the main food item for the people of this port. Since this month, its price has been</p>
<p>Continuous Rise</p>
<p>At first, they used the excuse of a prolonged drought to arbitrarily raise the price. However, after the rain, not only did it not fall, but it rose by as much as two yuan on the 15th, which is unreasonable. If it is because of strong exports, the rice stored in this port has not been exported, and the thickness of the stock</p>
<p>In the Hands of Rice Merchants</p>
<p>There are more than one million bags. Private hoarding and business houses, factories, and economically well-off families all have savings in advance, and the number is even more considerable. Recently, 300,000 bags of foreign rice have been newly ordered. There is no reason to raise the price. The motive is clearly manipulation. The general residents deeply hope that the authorities of the two concessions will, for the sake of future security, immediately promulgate effective measures and strictly implement them. According to concerned</p>
<p>Livelihood Issues</p>
<p>According to economists, in February of this year, the Public Security Office of the Public Concession detained dozens of cases of merchants who violated price limits. Soon after, the rice price immediately had a good impact. That is, after the authorities announced the pricing issue this time, most merchants watched. Since then, after continuous detention, the industry pricing on the market in this city has become widespread. Therefore, if you want to suppress and flatten prices at present, you should not only promulgate measures, but also</p>
<p>Effectively Prosecute</p>
<p>It can get better results. On the one hand, the price of rice in the stacks is limited to be sold, the time and quantity of the ordinary light are expanded, the group purchase of rice is supervised, and the types of goods, transaction prices, and selling prices are strictly marked, which can be effective. As for the expansion of the European war, it has nothing to do with foreign rice. In addition, foreign exchange has continued to ease recently. All rice merchants have sent telegrams to foreign countries to order a large amount of tribute rice, which has been continuously transported to Shanghai for storage.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Suggestions from the Shaoxiao Relief Association: Procurement of Jiangxi Rice; Affordable and Close, Sufficient for Emergency Relief; Additional Export Surtax Decided in Ningbo <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Shaoxiao Public Food Relief Association, in order to actively carry out relief for the rice shortage in their homeland, held a meeting at 3 PM yesterday at the association's location on Love Lane. They resolved the following: (1) Change the association's name to the Shaoxing Seven Counties Sojourners in Shanghai Shaoxiao Relief Association; (2) Request the Sojourners Association to telegraph the authorities to appeal for the unblocking of rice sources; (3) The "Price Stabilization Committee" in the articles of association passed at yesterday's general meeting will be renamed the Disaster Relief Committee, and the committee members are requested to actively solicit donations. The telegram from the association to the authorities via the Sojourners Association is as follows:</p>
<p>Request to Purchase Native Rice</p>
<p>Regarding the rapidly rising rice prices in Shaoxiao since the beginning of summer, reaching a peak of 120 yuan per stone, the situation is extremely dire. Impoverished people are exchanging children for food, and even digging up grass roots and tree bark, but these are also nearly exhausted, causing immense panic. The underlying cause is the lack of rice sources. If we purchase foreign rice, the price is too high and transportation is even more difficult. Even if it reaches the disaster area, it will still cost no less than sixty or seventy yuan, which offers no benefit to the impoverished. Sojourners in Shanghai recently convened a meeting and unanimously agreed that if Jiangxi rice could be procured, it would be affordable and close, quickly alleviating the crisis. This is a fundamental solution. We respectfully request that you forward this situation on our behalf to President Chiang Kai-shek, the Council of the Executive Yuan, representatives from Zhejiang Province in the National Assembly, the Zhejiang Provincial Assembly, and Chairman Wang Boqun of your association, to appeal for relief. This matter concerns public food, and we respectfully request your utmost assistance.</p>
<p>Shanghai Rice Arrives in Dinghai</p>
<p>According to visitors from Dinghai, the food panic in Dinghai has slightly eased. Rice arriving from Shanghai in recent days includes 250 packages purchased privately, weighing over 44,700 catties, and 400 packages of Rong salt for transportation, weighing over 79,400 catties. It is reported that public sales are still being held in the city. However, due to the small amount of rice in stock, it is temporarily not being distributed to stores for sale. Natives of Shiqi Town in Ningbo have initiated fundraising to manage price stabilization. Since the launch, donations have been very enthusiastic. Over 10,000 yuan has already been raised. The list of donations is not included here.</p>
<p>Deadline for Ningbo Donation</p>
<p>The Ningbo Sojourners Association in Shanghai telegraphed Commissioner Xu of the Sixth District of Ningbo and Magistrate Yu of Yu County, requesting the suspension of the export permit surtax for relief funds. It has now been learned that a reply has been sent to Shanghai, and this request has not been approved. Furthermore, the Ningbo Sojourners Association in Shanghai has scheduled a second donation drive for this month on the 12th at 2 PM at the Yu Qiaqing Road clubhouse to discuss various important proposals. The target donation amount of one million yuan must be paid in full by the 22nd. It is reported that those pledging donations in recent days have been quite enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Yuyao Disaster Severe; Appeal for Donations</p>
<p>The rice shortage in Yuyao, thanks to the strong assistance of Yu Qiaqing and Pan Jiufen in Shanghai, is less severe than in Shaoxing. However, the drought has been prolonged, and the disaster is widespread. The situation is twice as severe. In addition to continuing to entrust Mr. Yu to purchase foreign rice for relief, Shi Shufan, Zhou Weizhen, and Ye Erqi, and others from Yuyao who have come to Shanghai, are appealing to leaders of the Yuyao community in Shanghai to launch a donation drive for disaster relief. The general idea is as follows: "The famine in Yuyao has fortunately been greatly aided by Yu Qiaqing, and the various fellow villagers in Shanghai have generously raised funds, enabling the continuous purchase and transportation of foreign rice to overcome this difficult situation. The people of Yuyao are deeply grateful. However, the famine in the countryside has initially decreased, but the disaster has become even worse. Until recently, more than half of the rice crops in both upland and lowland fields have withered and died. The remaining 40-50% cannot be planted due to the cracked earth. It is certain that the autumn harvest will be hopeless. Based on this, the lives of tens of thousands of people may be prolonged for now, but how will they survive in the future? The people's resources are limited, and the ability to purchase will eventually be exhausted. By then, every household will be impoverished, and most will be empty. How can we bear to imagine what will happen? The Yuyao community is launching a fundraising campaign to prepare for famine and provide a last resort. We believe that the community leaders in Shanghai must consider the suffering and the urgency of the situation. When faced with a choice, they will surely be willing to act. We ask you to move from generous loans to donations of grain and assistance, doing what you can and putting your heart into helping our hometown. As for how to proceed to achieve rapid results, we hope that the leaders in Shanghai will plan carefully."</p>

<p>A visitor from Shazhou reported that a Chinese mobile unit in Jiangyin City had a major conflict with Japanese troops the day before yesterday, resulting in casualties on both sides. Afterward, Japanese troops conducted a major search, and hundreds of people were arrested. The situation outside the city is also extremely chaotic. In Xiagang Town, eight miles from the city, the mobile unit exchanged fire with Japanese troops, resulting in several deaths and injuries. The town's houses were burned. Currently, it is the busy season for planting rice seedlings, and the people have fled. The city gates have been tightly closed for three days and have not been opened.

Many military police were also patrolling along various roads, which was noticeably different from the usual state. The purpose of transporting the Japanese troops is not yet known.</p>

<p>After the inheritance tax regulations and implementing regulations were successively promulgated by the National Government, the Ministry of Finance established a direct tax office, which will be implemented nationwide starting July 1st. The collection of inheritance tax in the Shanghai concession area will not be delayed due to Shanghai becoming an isolated island. Moreover, income tax in the Shanghai concession area is still being collected as usual. Therefore, the collection of inheritance tax in Shanghai is being actively prepared by the Shanghai office of the Income Tax Bureau. It is reported that the inheritance tax regulations stipulate that if a person dies and leaves property within the territory of the Republic of China, inheritance tax must be collected. Citizens of the Republic of China who are domiciled within the territory of the country but have estates abroad are also subject to tax. Estates less than 5,000 yuan are exempt. Article 24 of the original regulations states, "The date and area of implementation of these regulations shall be determined by order." It has now been decided that it will be implemented nationwide from July 1st, without any geographical divisions.</p>

<p>Since the source of paper has become difficult, many people in society have been using local paper instead of foreign paper to provide relief and protect our rights. Recently, I heard that the inland has created a kind of light blue newspaper, which is made of domestic bamboo leaves and other materials. Its texture is thicker than rough-edged paper, rich in cotton and soft ink absorption, which can replace imported newspapers. The price is as low as one-third. According to people who have come to Shanghai from the mainland, newspapers and publications in the southwestern provinces used to use gray paper as a substitute because of the lack of newspapers, but the paper was rough and hard, not suitable for folding, and its color was dark. The oil ink printing was also very difficult to read. Now, after paper mills in various places have researched and manufactured this kind of newspaper, they feel satisfied under the adoption of various battles. Now it has stopped using gray newspapers and adopted this kind of light blue newspaper. According to a reporter who is familiar with the paper industry, the producing areas of foreign countries are in Europe: Norway, Sweden, Finland, paper, Czech Republic, Germany, and other countries in North America: Canada. However, since the expansion of the European war, European freight has become more difficult day by day, and Canada has also stepped up military production due to the European war, and the paper-making sector has been significantly affected. Recently, the American fleet has increased freight rates by 50%. Therefore, although it can be transported from Canada, the price is difficult to fall sharply. It is hoped that business, industry, culture, and printing will jointly promote the cultivation of national power by using scholars’ paper and seek self-sufficiency. It must not be trivial to benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Westerners Unable to Obtain Drafts; Stop Going to Japan for Summer; Japanese Economic Commissioner Greatly Criticized; Accused of Small Tricks and Lack of Integrity <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News yesterday published a letter from a reader signed "Old Tourist," stating, "I have something to say for the readers who intend to go to Japan for vacation in your newspaper, that is, the Japanese Economic Commissioner in Yokohama Specie Bank in this city refused to issue a permit to purchase yen drafts.</p>
<p>Unable to Follow the Exchange Rate in the City</p>
<p>Tourists are only allowed to carry a small amount of yen to Japan. To carry more than the excess, they have to purchase drafts. Now, they cannot purchase drafts according to the yen exchange rate in this city, and the cost of vacationing in Japan will increase by four times. Because one US dollar is only equal to 4.25 Japanese yen in Japan.</p>
<p>Book Cabin First, Then Buy Draft</p>
<p>A friend of mine, who plans to travel to Japan, encountered difficulties. I will describe it to warn others. On the 14th of this month, my friend visited the office of the Economic Commissioner to inquire whether he and his family could buy drafts for the cost of spending the summer in Japan. The other party replied that he must first show the ship ticket before he can be allowed to buy such drafts.</p>
<p>Ship Ticket Obtained, Draft Not Issued</p>
<p>My friend bought the ship ticket, which costs about 1,000 Japanese yen. The next day, he took the ticket to the commissioner's office again, but he was flatly refused. My friend argued that he would not have bought the ship ticket if he had not received a reply that he could buy a draft. The other party only replied with a cold shrug. My friend had no choice but to withdraw. Now he has to return the ship ticket and suffer a nameless loss. The cost of the vacation is not affordable to my friend if it is calculated according to the exchange rate of 4.25 Japanese yen.</p>
<p>Such Behavior Tarnishes Great Reputation</p>
<p>The commissioner's methods do not seem to be what a responsible Japanese official should do. He has made a promise that he can buy a draft, but he has broken his word, and he has earned the stigma of being untrustworthy and playing petty tricks. Any country that values reputation will not allow its officials to act in this way. If it had been made clear in advance that the draft could not be purchased, no one would have any complaints, but they would have made other plans for their vacations based on this.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Paint Worker Strike Expands; Police Watch Closely; Three More Shops Smashed Yesterday; Police Car Arrived to Suppress <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The labor strike of more than 7,000 paint workers in the city has been expanding since a group of workers smashed Xu Fa Ji Paint Shop the day before yesterday afternoon, and negotiations were interrupted. As of last night, there have been more than a dozen cases of workers harassing paint shops. As a result, most paint shops have been closed and posted notices stating, "Workers are rioting, business is temporarily suspended." The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Forced to Sign</p>
<p>At about 6:30 yesterday morning, over 30 striking workers suddenly arrived at Tan You Ji Paint Shop at No. 850, North Chengdu Road, Public Concession, and smashed the shop's tables, chairs, paint buckets, and signs. After hearing the news, the police officers in charge sent police to suppress the riot in a police car, and two people were arrested on the spot. At about 10:00 yesterday morning, the Dongfeifuxing Paint Shop on Barker Road and at about 11:00 am yesterday morning, the Shao Tingji Paint Shop on Mcgregor Road also had similar events. Also, at about 10:00 pm the night before yesterday, more than 20 workers came to Yu Xinfu Paint Shop at No. 1429, Rue Edward VII, and forced the shop owner to sign a contract, increasing the workers' wages to 2 yuan per day.</p>
<p>Negotiations Interrupted</p>
<p>Also, it is learned that the police authorities, because it concerns public safety, have already notified eight labor representatives, including Lu Shoufu, Zhou Hesheng, and Wang Zhongyuan, to report what they know about the workers who participated in the harassment of the paint shops. As for the five representatives of the employers, including Xu Gongpei and Sun Rui, they all resigned from their positions as representatives yesterday as a precaution. Therefore, it is difficult for the two sides to negotiate again for a while. However, with the efforts of the Public Works Department to mediate, it is not difficult to resolve it soon. The number of arrested paint workers yesterday was at least about ten. The police also returned the paint tools and objects confiscated from the workers to the industry association on Rue Edward VII. It is said that the association has decided to petition the Political Department of the Public Works Department today to request protection.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Former Wu Hua Bank Manager Wu Yi Suddenly Shot and Killed; Three Shots Hit; Murderer Captured on the Spot; Police Investigating the Cause of Death <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>A shooting occurred at Fulu Street, French Concession, at about 2:20 pm yesterday. The victim was Wu Yi from Hangzhou, who was shot three times in the chest and fell unconscious. The murderer, one person, was surrounded and captured by passers-by on the spot and taken to the Lujiawan General Police Station. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Taking Child to See Doctor</p>
<p>Wu Yi, 43 years old, is from Hangzhou, Zhejiang. He lives in a single-family shikumen at No. 166 Fulu Street, French Concession. At about 2:20 pm yesterday, Wu wore a light yellow suit, yellow leather shoes, and ordered a maid to hold his young child of about two years old, intending to accompany him to a doctor's office to treat his child. As he was about to step into his own car (license plate number 1760), because Zhuo was parked at the door of No. 160 next door, Sun Asi (36 years old, from Yancheng), the driver of the car, was starting the engine.</p>
<p>Suddenly Shot</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, a murderer, wearing a light gray gown, was lying in ambush on the side of the road. Seeing Wu approaching, he drew a gun and shot at him, firing three shots, all hitting the chest. Blood gurgled out. The perpetrator tried to discard his weapon and flee east, but fortunately, a crowd of passers-by gathered and captured him on the spot, confiscating a loaded pistol. The police were called and he was taken to the Lujiawan General Police Station for investigation. The suspect is about 30 years old and speaks a local dialect. At that time, after being shot, Wu ran home with his injuries. When he reached the door, his son, Zhongtao, suddenly heard the gunshots and went out to investigate. Seeing his father covered in blood, he almost fell to the ground, so he stepped forward to help him.</p>
<p>Seriously Injured and Died</p>
<p>At this time, Wu was unconscious and his complexion was pale. He was transported to Guangci Hospital for treatment in his own car with license plate number 1760. Because the injuries were in vital areas, he died before reaching the hospital. After a doctor examined him, the body was transferred to the autopsy room on Tairakan Road, waiting for the court to inspect the body today. According to his son, Zhongtao, in early May, the family received a threatening letter, the content of which roughly said that there was no need to form such a feud in the wind and moon field, and the tone contained a strong sourness. My father has been in the business world, and he often frequents brothels and dance halls. After my mother and others persuaded him to go less often to avoid being targeted, he has been living a simple life. It is really strange that he has suffered this unexpected event.</p>
<p>Poor Business</p>
<p>According to Wu, he graduated from Zhijiang University in Hangzhou in his early years, married a wife surnamed Shen, and is 43 years old. He has seven children. The eldest daughter, Mei Yun, is 19 years old and has not yet been engaged. The second son, Zhong Tao, is 16 years old and studying at Zhendan University Junior High School 2. The third son, Zhong Yuan, is 14 years old and is in the sixth grade of Chinese Elementary School. The fourth son, Zhong Yi, is 12 years old and is in the fourth grade of Weiyu Elementary School. The remaining three children are all young. Wu used to be the manager of Wuhua Bank and the Chinese manager of Italian Bank. After resigning, he founded Yi Ji Company, which was later reorganized into Zhongyuan Trading Company. However, due to poor business, it was closed two months ago.</p>

<p>Xiao Xiuying, an 18-year-old woman from Tongzhou, was a prostitute in a brothel opened by Wang Zhangshi from Yangzhou at No. 4, Old Hueilie Lane, Yunnan Road, Public Concession. She was usually beaten and forced to prostitute herself every night by the brothel owner, resulting in the development of syphilis. The brothel owner not only did not treat Xiao Xiuying but continued to force her to receive guests as before. Xiao Xiuying did not dare to disobey under the beatings. The syphilis she suffered from became more and more severe. According to her prostitute sisters, they often heard Xiao Xiuying sobbing quietly when night was quiet. I waited for it to shed tears of sympathy, and there was nothing more tragic than this in the world. Unexpectedly, Xiao Xiuying died of poisoning yesterday morning. The inhumane brothel owner Wang Zhangshi did not buy a coffin because of the high price of coffins recently. She only managed to buy a large wooden box containing Golden Mouse brand cigarettes nearby. She stuffed Xiao Xiuying's body into the box, nailed the lid, and moved the box next to the garbage can in the lane at 2:20 pm. Later, a Chinese policeman caught a glimpse of it and found it suspicious. He opened the box and discovered it. He immediately reported the matter to the police station. The police went to investigate and detained the brothel owner Wang Zhangshi and sent her to the Special District Court for legal action.</p>

<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) After the fall of Guangzhou, Lingnan University in Guangzhou moved to Hong Kong to continue classes at the University of Hong Kong. At the beginning of spring, the Ministry of Education ordered an inland relocation. The school decided to relocate the Agricultural College first. Some time ago, the Dean of the College, Gu Guifen, was dispatched back to Guangdong to select a site for the college. It was decided to move to Pingshi in Lechang, because the land there is fertile enough to develop agriculture. The school has been very busy lately preparing for the relocation. It will take advantage of the summer vacation in early July to transport the equipment in batches. The Guangdong Provincial Government will provide a one-time subsidy of 50,000 yuan for the relocation expenses. Chairman Li Hanhun sent a telegram to the President of the school, Li Yinglin, which said: "I have learned that your school's agricultural college is moving inland. I admire your dedication to cultivating agricultural and forestry talents and developing agriculture. Regarding the relocation expenses, the provincial government has decided to provide a one-time subsidy of 50,000 yuan to help with the relocation. As tax revenues are decreasing daily and the treasury is empty, we are unable to provide regular expenses. We sincerely hope that the college will move inland and open classes as soon as possible to meet the eager expectations." In addition, the affiliated middle school of the school previously ordered a batch of various instruments from the United States, which have arrived in Hong Kong, with a value of several thousand Hong Kong dollars.</p>

Decision to Trial By the American Basketball Rules Committee <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The height of the basketball basket in the current basketball game is only ten feet from the ground, which is extremely convenient for basketball players who are "as tall as the sky" to shoot baskets. It causes the team with shorter players to fail not because they are technically inferior to others, but because they are at a great disadvantage in terms of player height. Therefore, the American Basketball Rules Committee (National Basketball Rules Committee) has decided to try raising the height of the basket by two feet, for a total height of twelve feet, starting next season. It has been tested by Coach Art Edmundson of the University of Washington. Player Shilling, who is six feet four inches tall, tried to shoot under the old system basket, which was ten feet high, and it was almost casually dropped in, very easy. Another player, McDonald, who is six feet five inches tall, tested under the new system basket, which was twelve feet high, and it was determined that he could not use his height to obtain unexpected gains without relying on his well-trained skills. Therefore, based on the results of this test, the American Basketball Rules Committee decided to implement it on a trial basis starting next season, 1940-41. However, it is only a general trial nature. If no obstacles occur, the rules will be revised to be universally used. According to the United States, there are many players who are more than six feet five inches tall, so the unexpected gains without skills have long been deeply noted by the basketball community. For example, the means by which Ryan, the tall man of the former Shanghai Pirates team, casually put the ball into the basket, deeply threatened the shorter Chinese. If the basket is raised, the tall man will have no use for his extra convenience except to gain an advantage in the jump ball, and he will have to be judged on the merits of his skills with the shorter players to determine the difference between more and less.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Racecourse Fellow Club members held a flat target shooting competition. This year's participants were more numerous than in previous years, with nineteen members in Group A and seventeen members in Group B. In addition, in order to increase interest, a doubles flat target shooting competition was also held, with eight groups participating. The Group A and B competitions adopted a double elimination system, while the doubles competition adopted a single elimination system. After the competition started on the 16th of last month, it ended successfully after a month of fierce battles. Zheng Jiyi was the champion of Group A, Sun Jianqu was the runner-up, and Wu Shude was the third place. Li Kaiyuan was the champion of Group B, Hong Xiefan was the runner-up, and Chen Lingsheng was the third place. Li Kaiyuan won the highest record for consecutive hits calculated according to the flat target points. Double happiness came to the door, which was really not a coincidence. The awards ceremony and dinner party were held last night, with more than eighty participants. The atmosphere was lively and extraordinary. Before the event, the champions of Group A and B were invited to hold a friendly performance match. Halfway through the dinner, the club's Chairman Hong and Miss Bu Ying presented the awards. The champions, runners-up, and third-place winners of Group A and B each received a silver cup. Among them, the champion of Group A was donated by Gu Zhengxiang, the third place winner of Group A and the highest "Black" winner were donated by Zheng Jiyi, and the third place winner of Group B was donated by Jin Rongzong and Lu Xiwu. The doubles champion was donated by Gu Dingyu, and the rest were awarded by the club. There were a total of eleven awards, shining with silver light, which was a grand sight. The excitement was unprecedented.</p>

<h3 id="e84">Launching a Universal Savings Campaign for Overseas Chinese <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Ruilin</p>
<p>Raising 250 million yuan to Support National Construction</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The original text of this article is very detailed. It elaborates on the theory of resistance and national construction, provides detailed descriptions of the patriotic movements of overseas Chinese, and explains each estimate and suggestion exhaustively. However, due to the limited space of this publication, only the main points are excerpted. The introduction and conclusion have also been omitted. We hope the original author will understand!</p>
<p>Estimation of the Economic Power of Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Materials about overseas Chinese are quite scarce, making it difficult to accurately assess their economic power. However, common sense is the beginning of science. Based on common sense and combined with measurements from different perspectives, it is possible to approach the heart of the matter.</p>
<p>A. Observing from the Perspective of Population: According to the Nanyang Jian, the total overseas Chinese population, excluding over two million overseas-born Chinese in Siam, is 4,492,569. According to statistics from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, there are 330,000 overseas Chinese in North and South America, 45,000 in South Pacific Islands and Australia, 30,000 in European countries, and 612,310 in Hong Kong (pre-war figures). The total number is 7,459,120. According to Mr. Chen Jiageng's recent remarks published in the Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao on March 27, the total number of overseas Chinese reaches 11,000,000. This is still based on pre-war statistics, and the number of overseas Chinese going to Southeast Asia has been increasing daily since the war. In the Philippines alone, the pre-war overseas Chinese population was only 80,000 (according to Nanyang Jian). Now, it is generally believed to be over 120,000, an increase of one-third. Other regions have also seen significant increases. In short, the overseas Chinese population is between 5 million and 12 million. We will tentatively take the lowest number, 5 million, as the basis for our argument.</p>
<p>Assume that the total number of overseas Chinese (or those suitable for our war economy) is 5 million. Based on this number, let's estimate the wealth of the overseas Chinese. As far as we know, most overseas Chinese are productive members, and many have not established families in Southeast Asia. Among the 5 million overseas Chinese, about 1 million are unemployed, and 1 million are unable to produce, including women and children. Producers account for 3 million. If each producer's annual income is 360 Straits dollars, then the annual income of 3 million people is 1.08 billion Straits dollars, equivalent to about 700 billion yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>This is only the income of overseas Chinese, not their capital wealth. If 700 billion yuan is taken as the amount representing 1% annual interest on capital, then the total capital should be 700 trillion yuan. This figure is truly astonishing!</p>
<p>B. Observing from the Perspective of Overseas Chinese Businesses: According to statistics from the Philippine Department of Agriculture and Commerce, overseas Chinese investment in the Philippines is 502,020,313 Philippine pesos, including retail, grain and rice, import and export, textiles, coconut, hemp, tobacco, and other industries. Other investments in real estate and buildings, as well as stocks in banks and foreign companies, are not included. In Manila alone, overseas Chinese-owned buildings are worth over 20 million Philippine pesos. Stocks in banks and foreign companies are also around 20 million. As for land and houses in Cebu, Iloilo, Sandakan, Davao, and provincial capitals in the mountains, they are worth no less than 50 million Philippine pesos. Combining the Philippine Department of Agriculture and Commerce's statistics, the total overseas Chinese investment in the Philippines is at least 600 million Philippine pesos.</p>
<p>The Philippines, with only 120,000 overseas Chinese, has a total investment of as much as 600 million Philippine pesos. Assuming that the investment per overseas Chinese in other parts of Southeast Asia is equal to 30% of the investment of overseas Chinese in the Philippines, then excluding the 120,000 people in the Philippines (assuming a total overseas Chinese population of 5 million), the total investment of the remaining 4.88 million people would be 732 million Philippine pesos. Adding the 600 million pesos from the Philippines, the total is 800.2 million Philippine pesos, equivalent to over 5.6 trillion yuan in national currency. And this doesn’t include the labor capital of Chinese people.</p>
<p>C. Observing from the Perspective of Annual Remittances: According to authoritative statistics, between 1931 and 1935, overseas Chinese remittances ranged from a high of 412,200,000 yuan to a low of 123,800,000 yuan, averaging 332,038,000 yuan. This was during the global economic depression, and remittances were undoubtedly affected. At that time, the foreign exchange rate in China was also above 1 shilling and 5 pence, three times higher than the current black market rate of around 4 pence. Assuming that the current remittance value is the same as before, then the current annual remittances from overseas Chinese are at least around 700 billion yuan in national currency. Assuming that two-thirds of the 3 million productive overseas Chinese members need to remit money back home, and assuming that each person's remittance is one-fifth of their total annual income (360 Straits dollars), it can be inferred that the annual income of overseas Chinese is 525 billion yuan in national currency. Assuming that this is capital yielding 1% annual interest, then this capital is 525 trillion yuan.</p>
<p>From the above, the wealth of overseas Chinese, estimated by population, is 700 trillion yuan in national currency; estimated by business investment, it is 560 trillion yuan; and estimated by remittances, it is 525 trillion yuan. In other words, the wealth of overseas Chinese is between 525 trillion and 700 trillion yuan. For the convenience of calculation, assume that the total wealth of overseas Chinese is 500 trillion yuan, generating 50 trillion yuan in annual interest. If overseas Chinese can lend one-tenth of their annual income to the country as a fund to balance foreign exchange, the country would have an additional 50 billion yuan in income each year; if they can contribute 2%, it would be 100 billion yuan. This is indeed an astonishing amount of money!</p>
<p>The Donation Movement of the Past Three Years</p>
<p>The patriotic enthusiasm shown by overseas Chinese in the past three years of the war of resistance is highly commendable. The first thing to point out is the universality of this patriotic enthusiasm; regardless of social class, organization, men, women, old, young, wise, foolish, rich, or poor, all have risen up together!</p>
<p>The patriotism of overseas Chinese youth is unparalleled. Not only do they organize groups and hold meetings locally to promote various war-related activities, but countless young people also leave their parents, siblings, professions, and inheritances behind to return to China and work as drivers, orderlies, and nurses. For the survival of their homeland, they are ready to sacrifice their lives at any time.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese merchants treat the slogan of boycotting inferior goods as an order to be executed. In their vocabulary, there is no difference between unscrupulous merchants and traitors.</p>
<p>Their donations to the homeland have become an unprecedented and enthusiastic movement. According to various statistics, overseas Chinese have donated over 250 million yuan to the war of resistance in the past three years. It comes in several forms: purchasing government bonds, direct donations, or monthly pledges. Once the money is given, they do not think about getting it back. Although this amount is only enough for the country's war expenses for a little over a month, it is the crystallization of vast enthusiasm, and the country should accept it as 250 million hearts!</p>
<p>However, as a matter of reflection, we must also raise a question: have overseas Chinese fully demonstrated their strength?</p>
<p>If the financial resources of overseas Chinese are only enough to bear a donation of 250 million yuan, and any further burden would risk bankruptcy, then the government has received funds approaching this insurance line. In that case, the obligations of overseas Chinese can be considered fulfilled!</p>
<p>If the country's needs are not great, and the donations from overseas Chinese have exceeded those of all other compatriots, then it would be inappropriate to ask more from them.</p>
<p>If the country's other foreign exchange resources are already surplus, then the overseas Chinese sharing this huge war expense of 250 million yuan would be able to report to the homeland without regret!</p>
<p>However, the country currently faces needs that are ten times greater than 250 million yuan, and there is no easier or less harmful way to raise this amount. The economic capacity of overseas Chinese is not only not exhausted by 250 million yuan, but according to the previous estimates, there is a reserve that is ten to a hundred times greater than 250 million yuan. Therefore, we cannot help but say somewhat harshly: in the past three years of the war of resistance, overseas Chinese have not fully exerted their strength, nor have they completely fulfilled their due obligations. The donation of 250 million yuan, viewed as the contribution of 250 million hearts, is indeed a valuable gift. Viewed as the country's need, it is only equal to a little over a month of war expenses. Therefore, we must call for the financial strength and heart of overseas Chinese to correspond, and even more so for the economy of overseas Chinese to meet the needs of the homeland!</p>
<p>Long-Term Savings to Meet Long-Term War and National Construction</p>
<p>According to the previous estimates, the wealth of overseas Chinese abroad is between 500 trillion and 700 trillion yuan, with an annual income of 50 trillion to 70 trillion yuan. At this critical moment of national life and death, overseas Chinese have donated only 250 million yuan after three whole years of effort, less than 2% of their income in the past three years. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>The enthusiasm of overseas Chinese is unparalleled, and the leadership of overseas Chinese leaders is also beyond reproach. The reason why the achievements of the past three years have not kept up with the needs of the homeland is clearly not a matter of enthusiasm, but because many effective methods have not been adopted. One method that particularly deserves our mention is the savings movement that we are currently promoting.</p>
<p>Saving is one of the methods of accumulating wealth, because it is an easy way to turn small amounts into large amounts and concentrate capital invisibly. Therefore, it is widely adopted by countries around the world. Britain, known as the richest country in the world, began advocating "savings instead of donations" when the Second European War broke out. Although Japan has a relatively concentrated capital base, its economic foundation has been shaken after massive consumption. It has recently implemented forced public savings in an attempt to reverse the situation. China is an economically backward country, and the accumulation of national capital is inherently weak. Among the 450 million people in China, very few can come up with a large sum of money. It is already difficult to engage in construction in peacetime. Today, it is even more difficult to step up domestic production to meet the demands of resistance and national construction. The only way to remedy this shortcoming is to encourage people to practice thrift and save universally.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese are the most capable employees of saving in the entire country. If each person saves an average of two Straits dollars per month, 5 million people can concentrate 120 million Straits dollars in a year, which is equivalent to over 700 billion yuan in national currency at the current exchange rate. It is not difficult for overseas Chinese themselves to save two Straits dollars per month, but the accumulated funds are quite considerable. If all the funds saved up are lent to the government, a large part of the economic problems of the war of resistance would be solved!</p>
<p>Saving is a long-term economic activity. Unlike donations, which cannot be increased beyond a certain limit, saving becomes more powerful and widespread as it progresses. If the funds saved are used to lend to the government, then this economic activity can be said to be a constant donation activity. We are facing a long-term war, so we need a constant long-term donation to strengthen our national power.</p>
<p>Donating money to the country is a matter of course, but human psychology is contradictory: it is not completely selfish, but it cannot be completely public either. As an individual, one cannot help but think of oneself; as a society, everyone must take into account the interests of the public. The development of personality and the progress of society go hand in hand in this contradiction. Donating to save the country certainly does not determine personal interests, because the stronger the country, the more individuals will receive from the country. However, this calculation is ultimately complex and cannot clearly adapt to the contradictions of human psychology. If donations are treated as savings, and the saved funds are used as capital for financial institutions to benefit the people, and then the funds are lent to the country, this is public use of private funds. The benefits to the country are no less than donations, and for the people who contribute the money, it is a reliable investment. Public and private interests are discussed together. This is the unification of contradictions in human psychology and a worldly encouragement for the general public who contribute money.</p>
<p>Capital concentrated through savings will not have the risk of profits being privately monopolized, even if it is used in monopolistic industries. Because the owner of this capital is a large group of common people, and all profits will ultimately belong to the public. Furthermore, this is capital concentrated for the purpose of saving the country. Its first step is to benefit the country, and the country will not only give it absolute protection but also generous benefits. At a time when the entire country is working hard to encourage production and construction, the profits that this capital can obtain will exceed any investment in the world market. Because this loan is targeted at the entire country, its guarantee is more reliable than any bank. With the country's vast resources as the investment scope, its profits are beyond what other businesses can compare. This kind of investment takes both public and private interests into account. Saving the country is saving oneself, and obligation is right. The meaning is clear and unambiguous. With the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese to protect their homeland, this movement will surely be widely responded to. If our expectations come true, then the war expenses that the country can obtain from overseas Chinese each year will not be the mere 250 million yuan in three years, but a huge amount of 50 billion to 70 billion yuan each year. As long as the war of resistance does not end, this savings movement will not stop. For the country, the financial resources will flow endlessly, and for the overseas Chinese, the capital will accumulate more and more. Once victory arrives, using this capital to develop domestic industries will make a contribution to the plan of building the country that cannot be described with numbers!</p>
<p>But this is a principle recommendation. To make it a universal movement, an agency is still needed to promote it. Therefore, we suggest organizing a silver company to handle this matter. Let's assume its name is the Overseas Chinese Savings Lending and Construction Silver Company.</p>
<p>Organizing the Overseas Chinese Savings Lending and Construction Silver Company</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Savings Lending and Construction Silver Company aims to concentrate savings, lend to the government, strengthen the war economy, and participate in post-war construction. The company's capital is based on overseas Chinese savings. Assuming that 3 million overseas Chinese are able to participate in savings, with an average of two Straits dollars saved per person per month, 72 million Straits dollars can be obtained annually, equivalent to 50 billion yuan in national currency. The company's savings acceptance period is temporarily set at five years. If 50 billion is concentrated each year, 250 billion yuan can be obtained in five years. Then it will be set as the total amount of capital of this company.</p>
<p>The savings received by the company each month will be the shareholders' capital. All of it will be deposited into the local Bank of China and lent to the government at an annual interest rate of 6%. It will be settled once a month. Each time, the annual interest will be deducted first as capital for the company's development of basic construction. If 50 billion yuan is saved each year, the company can receive 30 million in interest in the first year, 60 million in the second year, 90 million in the third year, and 120 million in the fourth year. With this interest alone, a large-scale industry can be developed in the country. Five years later, when the war of resistance is won, order is restored, and the government is able to repay the principal, the company can become a capital group with over 300 billion yuan.</p>
<p>But how do we launch this business?</p>
<p>First, a sound theory is needed. Economic scholars from the entire country should first be invited to discuss and criticize this issue from various perspectives.</p>
<p>Second, a strict practical plan is needed. The best experts in the country should be recruited to engage in the design of the company's self-operated savings and lending, as well as various specific industrial constructions.</p>
<p>Third, close contact should be made with the government leading the resistance and national construction. All legislative plans of the company should be passed through the responsible government agencies and strictly accepted government supervision.</p>
<p>Fourth, a great cause needs a strong backing. The Overseas Chinese Savings Lending and Construction Silver Company is undoubtedly a great cause. Its success or failure will depend on whether it can obtain the support of enlightened people from all walks of life in society and whether it can obtain the response of the broad masses. Therefore, it is necessary to widely solicit domestic and foreign leaders and ask them to support this movement in the name of sponsors and founders.</p>
<p>Fifth, the patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Chinese is universal, but only a small number have the opportunity to fully express their patriotism. We know that there are tens of thousands of ambitious and promising fighters among the overseas Chinese masses in various ports, who are buried in the corners and ignored. But when they get a hard-won opportunity, what they can do for the country will definitely not be less than other overseas Chinese. Therefore, we must do our best to discover this group of hidden fighters and let them come out to participate in this movement.</p>
<p>Sixth, after the sponsors and founders from various places are gathered, we may first hold a founders' meeting to establish a temporary council and a temporary office, start calling on overseas Chinese to implement savings, and contact government agencies to handle various collection and payment procedures and sign necessary contracts.</p>
<p>Seventh, after the first year's capital is collected, a shareholders' meeting will be convened according to the shares, and official directors will be elected to form the board of directors. The official establishment of the company will be announced, and the temporary council and temporary office will be cancelled.</p>

<p>(1) How are the legal exchange rate and the black market exchange rate calculated? Please list the calculation method and formula using the US dollar as an example, and provide a detailed explanation.</p>
<p>(2) What is the basis for the rise and fall of gold prices? Please list the formula and explain how to calculate it in detail.</p>
<p>(3) Is it more advantageous to purchase US dollars in Hong Kong or Haiphong with Hong Kong dollars or Vietnamese currency than to purchase US dollars with legal currency in Shanghai?</p>
<p>The legal exchange rate is the foreign exchange rate under the control of the central government. The British exchange rate is 1 shilling and 2.25 pence, and the US exchange rate is 29.5 yuan (for its calculation method, please refer to "Economic Common Sense" written by Mr. Yang Yinpu).</p>
<p>(1) Black market exchange rate: To know the fluctuations of the black market exchange rate, you must first understand the meaning of the word "black market." Shanghai has always been a free market, with more imports than exports. According to the customs trade register, there has been a trade deficit for decades, so a large amount of foreign exchange is needed. Since the central government issued control orders, restrictions have been very strict. Foreign exchange cannot be applied for without proper procedures. Since the national army moved west, the central government's power has been beyond reach. Speculators took the opportunity to move and make waves, profiting from it and forming a black market for foreign exchange. Although the central government's HSBC price remained unchanged, the black market changed rapidly. It is an illegal transaction. In the future, the government may order a crackdown. Therefore, there is no fixed standard for black market prices. It all depends on the supply and demand situation and the changes in the situation.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Hidden Reefs in the Future of Raw Silk <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Xiang</p>
<p>Since the start of the spring silkworm season this year, two weeks have passed. The price of cocoons has broken last year's highest record. In particular, Wuxi is the most prominent. The large purchases by cocoon dealers are around 400 yuan. For the best quality cocoons, factories will bid at a high price of 450 yuan to 500 yuan. If the recent silk prices in Shanghai are converted into cocoon prices for comparison, there is no profit to be made from purchasing goods at such high prices, and there is even a loss.</p>
<p>Recently, New York's raw silk market has been quiet due to the sharp reduction in inventory and consumption. Foreign firms have lowered market prices. The eating price for white filature with 78-point regularity is only 4,800 yuan to 5,000 yuan. Still watching the development of the European situation. If we use last year's spring cocoons as an example, the average price of fresh cocoons was 120 yuan per picul. If 280 catties of baked cocoons are baked to form a picul of dry cocoons, the price of dry cocoons is only 236 yuan per picul. If 400 catties are reeled to produce a picul of raw silk, plus a production cost of 200 yuan, then the cost of each picul of silk is 1,650 yuan. Later, the Shanghai-US exchange rate suddenly shrank from 14 yuan to 6 or 7 yuan. In addition, overseas silk sales were smooth, and market prices rose daily. Chinese silk prices were aided by this change, so the speed of the sharp rise exceeded expectations. The price of raw silk had reached over 4,600 yuan per picul during the autumn silkworm season. It was already three times the profit. When the autumn cocoon market opened, Germany had already put pressure on Czechoslovakia. After a temporary peace, the silk market stabilized. Large purchases of autumn cocoons were above 250 yuan to 280 yuan. The best goods in the south of Wuxi even reached above 300 yuan. The cost of raw silk was over 4,000 yuan. Later, silk prices increased daily. Before the winter solstice, each picul of silk had risen to the 7,000 yuan mark. The factories made huge profits. At the end of the year, some made profits of several million yuan. This was due to (1) low cost, (2) sharp shrinkage of foreign exchange, and (3) smooth silk sales. Looking back at this year, due to the increase in small factories, there was a rush to purchase cocoons, and cocoon prices were released excessively. Therefore, costs have increased. Recently, the European war has intensified, Italy has officially declared war, and foreign exchange has seen a rebound. The New York silk market is sluggish, and market prices are showing a wavering trend. Silk factory operators have said that this year's business can be said to be like passing a difficult hurdle, unpredictable. The cocoon capital has already been large, and the silk market is unstable. The only question is to look at America.</p>
<p>Looking at the above table, the costs of last spring and this spring are very different. Even comparing the current cost of 5,049 yuan with the silk price of foreign firms in Shanghai, there is a loss of 49 yuan. To sell foreign firm silk, it is necessary to meet the standards of regularity and have a quality of 78 points regularity. If the inspection results are not good, the selling price must be lowered. Therefore, this year's silk factories should pay special attention to the quality of their products, and internal work should be more diligent. If the reeling can save twenty or thirty catties, the cost can be reduced by more than two hundred yuan. This depends on the quality of the cocoons received and the ability of the managers.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Wenzhou Charcoal Soars <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Since the beginning of the month, 1,000 piculs of Wenzhou charcoal have been shipped by steamer. Since then, there have been no more arrivals, so the market inventory has gradually been exhausted, and the price has soared. Recently, the industry in the city has broken the price of 10 yuan and 5 cents per picul, which is more than one yuan better than the quotation in the first ten days of the month. Other second-class goods such as Haimen flat cap charcoal have also taken the opportunity to rise to about 8 yuan per picul. Small bamboo basket Huangyan charcoal is 6 yuan and 8 cents. The above are all ex-warehouse prices. Delivery adds 2 cents per picul for cartage.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Dutch Tin Gradually Turns Around <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>In the Dutch tin market, the Hangzhou and Shaoxing merchants could do nothing before, and transactions on this street also felt sluggish, so the market price had once fallen back. However, since recently, the European war has become increasingly expanded, and the tin-producing areas of the Dutch Indies have been greatly threatened. Transportation is also quite difficult. The future source may be hindered. In addition to the Hong Kong gang and hoarders who have some existing goods in the local area, the remaining merchants have all sold out. Therefore, yesterday's market price has seen a sharp increase. For example, the number one goods with 99.9% purity sold for 1,800 yuan, 99.5% purity sold for 1,700 yuan, and third-class goods were also called for 1,500 yuan. Yesterday's transactions were only a dozen or twenty from the canning factory, printing gang, and machine factory families on this street. Most merchants from other ports are watching.</p>
<h3 id="e89">New Disk Yuan Price Also Falls <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The new disk yuan market price mostly fluctuates up and down with the local circular nail. Recently, because the local nail market has stepped back, the new disk yuan market price has also seen a decline. Yesterday's market price was called for 65 yuan per picul, and transactions were also quite light. Because the nail factories on this street see that the output of their goods is not widely sold, there is a large amount of existing goods, so there is no urgent intention to purchase raw materials, so there are not many transactions. Others, such as construction gangs, also only sold dozens of piculs.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw an increase in importers, and the trend improved. The association divided the existing goods of No. 24 coarse white sugar outside the warehouse at 70 yuan and a half to 70 yuan and 6 cents. Re-export goods are gradually tightening, initially at 56 yuan, and then rising to 56 yuan and 3 cents and 5 cents, rising 5 cents. The Taikoo Car White B mark was 82 yuan and a half to 83 yuan, rising 5 cents. National sugar is being released.</p>

<p>Xuzhou News: Due to the drought this year, the new golden vegetables are difficult to grow, and the branches are very short, which has already shown signs of scarcity. It is expected that the harvest will only be 40% to 50%. It can be seen around the beginning of next month, and there is a saying that a certain party is controlling it. If it is implemented, it will inevitably increase exploitation.</p>

<p>Cassia twigs originate from Guangzhou. Due to the region's occupation, although Chinese merchants still transport them, they are subject to certain restrictions, making it difficult to profit. Consequently, the supply has been scarce, and the market has been firm. However, recently, some foreigners have directly shipped them to Shanghai, resulting in a surge of goods and an abundance in the market. People are becoming bearish, and the opening price has already dropped by five or six yuan compared to the previous market.</p>

<p>— Authored by American Medical Doctor Huang Zhongchang</p>
<p>Factors Leading to Marital Breakdown</p>
<p>Speaking of the tragic situation after a couple falls out, it's simply indescribable. Even if one is fortunate enough to have a relatively gentle wife, she may remain calm on the surface but secretly feel resentful and regretful, being unhappy all day long. But if one encounters an uninhibited woman, she will inevitably retaliate, leading to mutual quarrels and even court appearances, seeking divorce. All of this stems from the husband suffering from hidden illnesses, weakness, or incomplete development, resulting in a lack of coordination in reproductive functions, leading to such tragic events of separation and death.</p>
<p>I am a specialist in venereal diseases. Doctors prioritize protecting the interests of patients. I firmly believe that in cases of such diseases, it is crucial to avoid purchasing new, branded, cheap, and inferior drugs. The market is flooded with various medicines, especially Western tonics made with counterfeit Chinese medicine ingredients, with all sorts of tricks and nonsensical claims, such as being made with white fungus, tortoise plastron, tiger bone, or even adding ginseng, bird's nest, and deer antler. It is important to know that these medicines not only lack these ingredients but also such things don't exist. Because, Western tonics made with Chinese medicine ingredients, this extraction method has not yet been invented, nor is there any need for invention. Why? If you want to take Chinese medicine tonics, why not directly buy and decoct them? All of these are responsible words. If you don't believe me, there are Chinese medicine stores everywhere in this city. You can ask the store staff. Do they know of such situations, and whether such inferior medicines that claim to have Chinese medicine ingredients and deceive people in the form of Western medicine actually have the ingredients they claim? Then you will suddenly understand. You must know that the reason for deficiency of essence and kidney is due to the damage to the puberty glands, which control sexual desire, caused by masturbation or indulgence. Therefore, you must take "Buti Kang" for men, a preparation made with the puberty gland extract of robust animals. "Buti Kang" not only uses animal endocrine as the main ingredient but also contains brain-nourishing phosphorus, blood-tonifying iron, and bone-strengthening calcium, truly having the effect of nourishing the brain, kidney, and essence. Only those with spermatorrhea should be treated with "Naiersi Spermatorrhea Tablets". Women with irregular menstruation, anemia, breast lumps, or incomplete development should take "Buti Kang" for women.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Cured Cases of Spermatorrhea <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting</p>
<p>Patient Hu Xixiang, 23 years old, from Pudong, formerly the assistant accountant at Peidong Tobacco Factory. (Self-report) — When I was 16 years old, I made friends carelessly and developed the habit of masturbation. By the age of 18, my masturbation became even more severe, causing my body to weaken day by day. The frequency of spermatorrhea was highest at the age of 18, averaging twice a week. If I overworked, I would suffer from spermatorrhea, my sexual organs would be small, my head would be dizzy, my back would ache, and I would have all sorts of ailments. Although I have now recognized the harm of masturbation and quit, my symptoms remain. I deeply know that if I don't cure it completely, the future consequences will be dire, so I specially seek treatment. (Symptoms at the time of diagnosis) — Weight 100 pounds, pale complexion, poor development, poor appetite, frequent spermatorrhea, fatigue upon waking up, sexual neurasthenia has spread to the brain. (Treatment process) — I instructed him to take good care of his health, pay attention to exercise, have electrotherapy for 15 minutes every day, and take three German Biwan sperm essence preparation "Buti Kang" for men three times a day. Before going to bed, he also took "Naiersi Spermatorrhea Tablets", which are specifically for treating spermatorrhea. After a month, he felt his essence was sufficient and his spirit was vigorous upon waking up, his appetite improved, his complexion improved, and the frequency of spermatorrhea decreased to once a week. Spermatorrhea was completely eradicated. He took it for another month, and all symptoms disappeared. He then stopped taking it. One month after stopping, his weight increased by five pounds.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Success of Chemical Therapy for Gonorrhea <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— German Medical Doctor Wang Kechun</p>
<p>The use of chemical therapy for gonorrhea did not start today, but its success with chemical therapy started today. After the invention of these therapies, gonorrhea patients have begun to gain the freedom obtained with syphilis. Now there is the latest gonorrhea chemical therapy, "Xin Ke Lin Nong." This agent is the result of years of efforts to research and improve by Dr. Peter, a German gonorrheal scientist. Originally, the gonorrheal diplococcus is very stubborn and can resist weak bactericidal power, and is rich in reproductive power, so when we do not completely kill the gonococcus, it already has new followers and redevelops internally, which is why general bactericidal drugs on the market are ineffective. Only the drug "Xin Ke Lin Nong" is based on the principles of chemical therapy and is more improved. Its bactericidal power is very strong and rapid, but there are no adverse reactions to general chemical therapy. After taking German "Xin Ke Lin Nong," all deep and shallow gonococci can be completely eliminated, so all acute and chronic leukorrhea can be completely and thoroughly resolved. As for external medicine, men can use "Anti-Lin Water" externally according to the diagram and instructions to secretly wash the urethra at home. Women can use "Ka Er Xue Di Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories. Take "Xin Ke Lin Nong" internally (all three medicines are sold at Taihe Pharmacy)</p>
<h3 id="e97">Gonorrhea Lecture: Incessant Gonorrheal Filaments <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The symbol of gonorrhea, in addition to the rice-colored urine discharge, there are also incessantly flowing gonorrheal filaments that discharge from the urethra. The incessant nature of these filaments is proof that the gonorrhea has not healed. Wherever there is a trace of gonococci inside, inflammation occurs, and these inflammations are conditions for producing filaments. The presence of filaments is evidence that the gonorrhea has not healed. However, there are also cases where the filaments have stopped, but the gonorrhea has not healed. One must have an experienced doctor to have the ability to distinguish. The shape of the filaments is also inconsistent, some are dot-shaped, and some are fiber-shaped. These filaments are often caused by residual inflammation of posterior urethral gonorrhea. Cystitis and prostatitis are also common. Therefore, to eliminate these filaments, one must use a comprehensive treatment. Among the internal medicines, one must recommend the latest chemical therapy, "Xin Ke Lin Nong" (available at Wing On Company) as a giant. As for physical therapy, German static electricity therapy is the best. I always use these therapies together, which can resolve the filaments and completely cure gonorrhea, with remarkable effects. It also treats syphilis, buboes, chancres, sexual neurasthenia, and other diseases.</p>

<p>— Physician Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Patient Feng Yongde had a weak constitution. At the age of twenty, he suffered from hemoptysis. He recovered after resting for several months. Later, due to excessive brain use, it relapsed last summer, with chest tightness and shortness of breath, coughing up bloody phlegm. He had a mild fever of 37.7 degrees in the evening, and his body became increasingly thin and haggard. He had difficulty sleeping at night, had many dreams and palpitations, and suffered from night sweats, leading to dizziness and fatigue upon waking up. After an X-ray examination, there were small cavities the size of silver coins in the lungs, and tuberculosis had reached the third stage. He was prescribed German "Xiu Fei Na Er" internally. After taking less than two bottles, the night sweats and fever were eliminated, and the condition greatly improved. Therefore, he continued to take it continuously for three weeks, and at the same time, he was instructed to rest absolutely quietly at home and consume more nutritious foods. The cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, and other symptoms were completely cured, and his appetite greatly increased, and his weight increased. He was transformed into a strong and handsome man.</p>

<p>The stomach is located between the heart and abdomen and holds the central hub of the body's digestive functions. However, often due to our improper diet, stomach ailments arise, such as loss of appetite, vomiting, nausea, and unbearable stomach pain, leading to internal damage and becoming a dangerous condition.

<p>His desire for pleasure is even more extravagant, taking courtesans in carriages, unafraid of meeting decent people. His eyes are filled with prosperity, and his ears are filled with noise. In an instant, he seems to be riding on clouds. He goes home, spending his days in darkness, indulging in opium dens. Quickly, the sedan chair is carried, and he goes to the restaurant with a smile. He busily pulls up a stool and places it beside her. "You have a cup, and I have a cup. If the young master loses the drinking game, the courtesan will take his place." Even more delighted, he whispers in her ear, "Come back early when the party is over." Competing for face, not wealth, they set up a drinking game at the roadside, everyone showing off their wealth. "You set up a single table, and I'll set up a double table. Whoever occupies the room will not give way." The unluckiest is he who sleeps alone on the bed, unable to see the jade beauty. The prodigal son has forgotten his home, seeing the young girl he wants to deflower. The blind man cannot distinguish the real from the fake. The crazy butterfly picks flowers, and the violent rain breaks buds. He is unafraid of the cyclical laws of nature. Don't be extravagant. See how his wife and daughters will bring about retribution without fail. How laughable are these people who listen to the courtesan wanting to redeem herself, selling all their land with joy. They don't care about the thousands of gold coins, nor about the poverty of their family. They still claim that they are doing it for love. Don't be dazed. Since you are not taking her as a concubine, why be so infatuated? Prostitution and gambling go hand in hand, picking a leader for the courtesans, asking people everywhere to invite friends. Today's entertainment, tomorrow's entertainment. The wealth of ten thousand gold coins will be reduced to nothing. Stop early, quickly repent, and live a peaceful life. Opium is inherently heartless, especially when it is readily available in brothels. Breathing it in every day becomes a true addiction. Desiring to increase energy, they gradually increase the dose, guaranteeing to ruin the hero's life. For the sake of happiness, they throw themselves into the trap, lamenting that there is no one to save them.</p>

<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>"Peach blossoms dot the ground, leaving red snow; bamboo leaves brew spring water, replacing green tea," this is a poem by a certain predecessor. Using the tender buds of newly sprouted bamboo leaves, picking them and brewing tea, is indeed very fragrant, pleasant, and delightful.</p>
<p>The common food of Westerners is bread. Chinese people imitate them, so bread is flooding the market. Even the problem of eating rice is no longer a problem, unless it becomes a bread problem, to show that one is fashionable. Examining the ancients, there was no item called bread, but there was something called "bao mian" (wrapped noodles). Wei Juyuan's diet book of the Tang Dynasty: "Wonton is called 'chaoshao' by the Chu people, and also called 'bao mian'."</p>
<p>Common people must use perilla when cooking crab. Bo Sha Zhuolao's Leisurely Days mentioned: "Crabs with only one claw, one eye, four legs, or six legs, all have poison. Their nature is most afraid of perilla. All those who transport crabs from Tianjin to Beijing use donkeys and camels. They must first send people to scout the road. If there is perilla in the area, they will take a detour. If they accidentally touch its scent, none will survive." Also, my friend Zhuang Jun has not eaten crab for hundreds of years, saying that the cooking of crab is the most cruel. Thinking of it, he cannot bear to eat it.</p>
<p>Water chestnuts from South Lake are the best. Years ago, I bought a boat and climbed the Misty Rain Tower, peeling water chestnuts while leaning on the railing. Their freshness was indeed unmatched by those from other places. I heard that Zhangqiu Baiyun Lake also produces water chestnuts with a great reputation. Unfortunately, I have not been able to taste them. Pu Liuxian has a poem about eating water chestnuts from Baiyun Lake: "After the rain clears over the lake, red water chestnuts are densely covered with leaves. The mooring pole is freshly picked, singing out the autumn of Baiyun." Hearing this, I can't help but feel longing for the depths of Baiyun.</p>
<p>Wujiapi wine has a strong and fragrant taste of the country. Since Yue wine increased in price, Wujiapi wine has become even more prevalent in the market. According to history, this wine existed long ago. Li Zhulan's Six Inkstone Studio Notes said: "Wujiapi is named Yu Yan, also known as the writing grass. Qiao Zhou's Record of Strange Things from Ba and Shu, Praise of Writing Grass: 'Writing grass makes wine, which can complete its flavor. Buying grass with gold does not mean it is expensive.'"</p>
<p>Foods entering poems inevitably make people's mouths water when reciting them. For example, the late Chen Diexian said: "Quail bones are removed and fried into crispy pairs, radishes are pickled with the skin on in five spices, soy milk and butter tea are seasoned with monosodium glutamate, and cauliflower chicken congee is mixed with flowing yellow." Liangban Qiuyu Anzai has a poem: "Wuxi carp and Pengze wine, Guanzhou chestnuts and Huoshan tea." Hu Buyi said: "Mandarin fish appear on the peach blossom waves, water shield is fat when willow catkins fly," and also: "Green wine is so sweet that people easily get drunk, green tea can dilute the initial taste," and also: "Green jade cups are worthy of accompanying wine, golden chrysanthemum replaces boiled tea." If things like this are compiled, it would not be difficult to make a food poetry talk.</p>
<p>Eggplant is also called Luosu, and its purple color is quite lovely. I heard that those produced in Beiping are flat and round like persimmons, while those produced in Southern Guangdong are as long as a foot. This is due to the earth's energy.</p>
<p>River eel tastes delicious, but it is poisonous and can kill people. Therefore, there is a saying that one eats river eel while risking death. In fact, this is because the cooking method is not proper. If done properly, it will definitely not be poisonous. The mother of painter Wu Jun Hufan is good at cooking river eel. Her family regards river eel as a regular dish, often serving it with meals. Now that his mother has suddenly passed away, I am afraid that he will not be able to taste its flavor again.</p>
<h3 id="e103">A Talk on Summer Clothing Experiences <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Plum</p>
<p>Summer has arrived, and white clothes will be everywhere again. However, this white color is most easily soiled, and even a slight stain is very ugly to see, so it must be washed.</p>
<p>Therefore, when wearing clothes in summer, one must be careful everywhere. For example, before sitting on a stool, one must first see if the stool is clean. It is best to wipe it with a handkerchief first, or when in the office, you can put a piece of white paper on the stool to avoid getting dirty. Also, when walking up the stairs, you have to lift your long gown a little to keep your clothes clean. When you get home, you can take off your long gown, short shirt, and pants immediately (wearing only a T-shirt and shorts is cool and convenient), fold them neatly and put them in the closet. Do not casually hang them on a hanger, which will definitely reduce the number of times you have to wash them. Of course, this can at least reduce the damage to the clothes.</p>
<p>Secondly, if you are in the office, you can also roll up the sleeves of your short shirt and fold the collar outward. This way, only the T-shirt will get wet when you sweat, so it is only good to wash the T-shirt.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding washing clothes, you must always instruct your wife or servants to wash them gently and lay them out neatly and straight when drying them. Because whether you are careful when washing clothes is very important for the damage to the clothes themselves. Do not wash them excessively. Wait until they are slightly dry before collecting and folding them. After folding them, wrap them in a cloth and put them on the table, then press them with a stool, or sit on the stool yourself. Sitting for an hour will make them as neat as if they had been ironed. This way, not only can you save on electricity bills, but also the clothes will not be easily damaged. In short, you can't be careless everywhere when wearing clothes in summer.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Talking About Rice <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Green Leaves</p>
<p>The country takes the people as its foundation, and the people take food as their heaven. A country cannot be without people, and people cannot be without food. In the past six months, although the concession authorities have done a lot of work on the people's food supply, the manipulation and hoarding of unscrupulous merchants are still openly taking place, and the price of rice has broken the 60 yuan per shi mark. Those who have difficulty making a living and resort to illegal activities are really forced to do so. Tracing back to the source of the disaster, both the robbers and the unscrupulous merchants must jointly bear the responsibility for this impact on public security.</p>
<p>Shanghai people take rice as the main food for three meals a day. Although flour is also one of the people's food, its sales are not as strong as rice. Although there is no accurate statistic for reference on the total daily demand for rice in Shanghai, it is estimated to be more than 5,000 shi on average based on the number of sales in the market. Other entrepot trades are not included.</p>
<p>The sources of rice are different. Rice from various parts of this province is called "Du Mi" (local rice); rice from various parts of other provinces is called "Ke Xian" (guest indica rice); rice imported from abroad is called "Yang Mi" (foreign rice).</p>
<p>"Du Mi" is mostly transported from Changshu, Wuxi, Qingpu, Kunshan, Songjiang, Sijing, and other places. The quality of Changshu is the best. Changshu rice has large and uniform grains, soft texture and white color. When cooked, it is fragrant, glutinous, and smooth, and has a very strong swelling property. One bowl of rice can be cooked into three bowls of rice. Smart housewives are most happy to buy it. "Ke Xian" mostly comes from Wuhu, Jiujiang. The color is not white, and the grains are pointed and long. It must be re-milled in the factory before it can be sold. "Yang Mi" is shipped from Annam to Shanghai by foreign merchant ships. The grains are small and dry. Shanghai people originally did not eat "Yang Mi," but since the price of rice has been high, they have switched to eating "Yang Mi." Among "Yang Mi," there is a kind of top grade, which comes from ____, with long, large, and clear grains, most suitable for frying rice, and its taste is not inferior to "Du Mi." This top-grade "Yang Mi" is not sold in ordinary shops, but only a few Guangdong food stores sell it. Some time ago, the bottom of Da Sun Company also sold it for more than 5 jiao per pound.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of rice. "Du Mi" and "Ke Xian" are just general names. There are more than a dozen detailed names: such as Bai Geng (white japonica), Tong Bian - also known as Bai Yuan (white round), commonly known as glutinous rice, Bo Dao (thin rice), Zao Geng (early japonica), Hong Dao (red rice), Xiang Geng (fragrant japonica), Ye Dao (wild rice), Yin Yuan (yin round), Yang Jian (foreign pointed), Du Jian (local pointed), Bu Jian (wharf pointed), Ling Bai Jian (water chestnut pointed), Lu Jian (reed pointed), etc.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice is needed for making pastries and other things, and it is also the main raw material for brewing wine. The main source is Danyang. Bo Dao - also known as Wan Geng (late japonica), contains stickiness, and is sold in Tianjin, Dalian, Qingdao, and other ports. The market price is on par with the top-grade Bai Geng. Zao Geng and Hong Dao are produced along the Jinghu ports. Xiang Geng is the best product for cooking porridge, not only delicious, but also fragrant. Yang Jian - also known as Yang Xian, has excellent swelling properties, but it is not sticky and glutinous. It is very different from japonica rice and is not suitable for making cakes. It can only be used for cooking rice. It is shipped from Jintan, Aoyang, Yixing, and other places to Shanghai, and the sales are mostly in Tianjin, Fujian, and Ningbo. Du Jian - also known as Du Xian, has round grains, similar to japonica rice, and is often mixed with Bai Geng for sale in small rice shops. Ling Bai Jian is the Du Jian harvested when the water chestnut is growing. Lu Jian is the one harvested when the reed is plump. Yang Jian is named because the grains are thin and long like goat horns. These names, when spoken by people in the rice industry, make people confused, but once explained, they are not surprising!</p>
<p>People from Beiping, Tianjin, Jinan, Taiyuan, and other places who live in Shanghai do not often eat rice, but often eat millet porridge. The so-called millet is a kind of sticky sorghum, similar to the fine rice that Shanghai people feed birds. But millet porridge is very nutritious, sweet, and gentle on the stomach, soft and glutinous, and the price is not as high as japonica rice. It is really the best food.</p>
<p>The price of rice rises again and again. Some people advocate using japonica rice to cook porridge, and I also agree very much. An ancient person has a poem about eating porridge, which may be chanted:</p>
<p>"Cooking rice is not as good as cooking porridge, you should discuss it with your daughter! One liter can be used as two liters, and two days can be used as six days of food; if there is a guest, it does not matter to add water and fire, if there is no money, why ask for soup, do not dislike the plain taste, in the plainness, the taste is long."</p>

<p>Prepare: Eggs, shiitake mushrooms, green bamboo shoots, monosodium glutamate, spicy soy sauce, household pure white water chestnut flour, fine salt, lard.</p>
<p>Method: Crack open the eggs and beat them well, then cut the shiitake mushrooms and green bamboo shoots into fine pieces. Add an appropriate amount of monosodium glutamate and fine salt to both the egg liquid and the mushroom and bamboo shoot pieces. When frying, first spread lard on the bottom of the pot, then pour the egg liquid into the pot, the thickness should be like an egg skin. Then sprinkle the shiitake mushroom and bamboo shoot pieces on the surface of the egg skin, and then pour a layer of water chestnut flour. Thus, one layer of egg liquid, one layer of mushroom and bamboo shoot pieces, and one layer of water chestnut flour are layered in this way, layer by layer until a suitable number of layers, with the top layer still needing to be poured with egg liquid. Each layer should be as thin as possible, and then steam it over a slow fire. Before eating, first cut it into slices, and it is best eaten with spicy soy sauce. It is truly a good dish for summer.</p>

<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>This year, the season for eating new broad beans seems to be very short. After not many times, the beans are already old. Recently, the price of beans is around 2 jiao 5 fen per jin, which is still not very expensive in this time of soaring prices. Moreover, beans are rich in vitamins, so you may want to eat more of them. However, there are not many ways to cook old broad beans. If you want to change the pattern, it is really not easy to change. The most common household method is to shell the beans, spread them into a paste, and stir-fry them with pickled mustard greens or chopped green onions. If you want to save some soy sauce, then just use salt, and do not use soy sauce at all. Another method is to not spread them into a paste, but simply use the broad bean kernels and make soup with pickled mustard greens, adding a little sesame oil, which is also refreshing and delicious. In addition, you can not remove the skin and shell, and braise them with soy sauce, making Wusu beans to eat. As for meat methods, I have not heard much. I once minced pork (beef is also acceptable) into a paste and stir-fried it with broad bean paste. When eating, I used a little spicy soy sauce, which has a very Western flavor. Readers may want to try it.</p>
<p>Monday: Stir-fried shredded pork with green peppers, sweet and sour pomfret, stir-fried broad bean paste with pickled mustard greens, Qing Sha cabbage</p>
<p>Tuesday: Beef broad bean paste, braised salted fish with tofu, stir-fried calcium tendon with shrimp roe</p>
<p>Wednesday: Stir-fried diced meat with sword beans, fried yellow croaker with pickled mustard greens, stir-fried red vegetables, stinky dried tofu</p>
<p>Thursday: Yangcong shredded beef, clear fresh fish, braised vegetarian ten scenery, fried dough sticks and soybean sprouts</p>
<p>Friday: Cabbage-wrapped meat, egg drop soup with dried shrimps, stir-fried dried shredded bean curd with green peppers, tofu with toon</p>
<p>Saturday: Sweet potato beef soup, stir-fried seasonal shrimp with cucumber, braised tofu with spinach, chopped green onion broad bean paste</p>
<p>Sunday: Meat stewed sauce, fried ribbonfish, stir-fried vegetables, soybean sprouts</p>

<p>— Dong Er</p>
<p>The American Kaiser City Children's Department has compiled statistics on the causes of accidental death and injury to children in the home, which can be divided into several points: (1) steps on stairs that are concave in the middle or already dilapidated; (2) ropes used for hanging or tying are very loose, and if they break, heavy objects will fall; (3) scattered gravel and broken glass on the ground that have not been cleaned up; (4) knives, forks, bamboo strips, and the like are not put away properly, and it is not uncommon for children to cut their fingers while playing, and the statistics also record this as the most frequent occurrence.</p>
<p>These are just the most common points. In addition, the Children's Department points out that doing the following can greatly reduce misfortunes in the home: (1) open windows should have iron bars, but if not, install leather straps or ropes; (2) a gate should be installed at the top of the stairs so that children can play safely nearby without worry; (3) the bottom of the stairs in some homes is very dark, making it difficult to find footing, and there have been many falls, so white paint should be applied to the bottom; (4) poisons such as Lysol should be placed out of the reach of children, and other medicines should also be treated the same way, otherwise the bottles and boxes should be sealed with glue-coated thread; (5) it is naturally best if the home stove can be equipped with a water copper hanger, but some stoves have uneven tops, and if the copper hanger is on top, it will overturn with a touch, because burns are also the most common of unfortunate events in the home.</p>
<p>We believe that the above points can be adopted and implemented by general families, which will be very beneficial, and the difference between a safe family and a dangerous family lies in this.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Fines Are Useless <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Merchant</p>
<p>According to news from a few days ago, the French Concession Police Department inspected various shops in the concession and found more than a hundred cases of illegal business operations, all of which have been fined separately. This vigorous crackdown has at least dealt a serious blow to merchants who only seek profit. However, things took an unexpected turn. Yesterday's newspaper reported: "Among the eighty-three items in the French Concession, twenty-four have increased in price, of which eighteen are even higher than the prices in the Public Concession south of Suzhou Creek." This is not an accidental phenomenon, but shows that fines are useless.</p>
<p>Because raising prices, in their view, is no longer an illegal business operation. Even if the Police Department finds out and fines them a few dollars, it is of no consequence. As the saying goes, "the wool comes from the sheep." When the authorities are occasionally negligent (in fact, the Police Department cannot inspect every store every day), they can still recover from their customers. Therefore, to eradicate this phenomenon of "I'll raise prices myself," there must be more severe sanctions in addition to fines!</p>
<p>What are the severe sanctions? Announce the store name! If the detailed addresses and names of the more than one hundred shops that were fined are announced to all citizens, so that everyone remembers that they are "black shops" and refrains from entering, causing them to suffer in their business, then that can serve as a warning to others.</p>

<h3 id="e109">"Glass Cup" <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Duo</p>
<p>"Want to sit for a while?" As we wandered aimlessly around the playground, a stylishly dressed, slightly seductive woman softly and pleadingly asked us.</p>
<p>We shook our heads, meaning no. Seeing that we could not fulfill her hope, the woman went off to search for another customer in frustration.</p>
<p>My colleague Sun nudged my arm and lightly told me: "This is a 'glass cup'!"</p>
<p>"Why is such a perfectly fine person called a 'glass cup'?"</p>
<p>"That's probably because they sell tea. Isn't tea served in glass cups? People use that term to symbolize that kind of woman?" He continued, "I have a female colleague from a yarn factory who is also working as a glass cup here. Do you want to see her?"</p>
<p>I nodded and followed him to a small garden on the eighth floor. Sun found his former colleague, a girl in her twenties.</p>
<p>Sun unexpectedly greeted her, brewed a cup of tea, and introduced me to her. A faint blush appeared on her face, which was covered in makeup, as if she felt infinitely ashamed.</p>
<p>Sun explained to her: "You are forced to do this by life. It doesn't matter." Then she told us:</p>
<p>"I used to be a colleague with Mr. Sun. We were both at the Yangshupu ×× Yarn Factory. He was a staff member, and I worked in the testing department. After the war, the yarn factory closed down, and all the staff and workers were dismissed, and from then on, I fell into the tide of unemployment. But how can I live without work? I had no choice but to come here to do this kind of thing. It's very embarrassing to talk about.</p>
<p>"To do this kind of thing, you just need an introduction from an acquaintance (mostly inspectors). No security deposit is required. Each section has a few dozen, and the larger ones, like the Da Jing Ban below, have more than a hundred people. We don't have a salary. We also have to give the tea room ten cups of tea money every day, two corners per cup, which means we have to pay two dollars every day. The rest is your income. If it's less, you have to make it up.</p>
<p>"The customers we entertain come from all walks of life: workers, small clerks, street heroes... Our livelihood depends entirely on those customers giving us extra tips. Usually, drinking a cup of tea will give us at least five or six corners, and good customers will give us more than one dollar.</p>
<p>"Our kind of life is also very hard. The venue is so small, and there are so many competitors. The show is divided into day and night sessions. If you do five or six or seven or eight cups in each session, it's already 'Na Ma Wen' [Cantonese slang, meaning 'lucky']. Most only get one or two cups, and many still have to 'eat duck eggs' [get nothing]...</p>
<p>We paid and said goodbye to her, taking the opportunity to make a bird's-eye view of this area. We saw all kinds of people lying on rattan mats, with so-called "glass cups" standing or sitting beside them, tirelessly pouring "intoxicating soup" to obtain their daily living materials. But many were walking around anxiously, looking around like hunting dogs, looking for their customers.</p>
<p>When we left, it was already ten o'clock. We looked at the water sign board on the counter, and many "glass cups" had one or two strokes written under their names; many names were still blank, a "blank slate".</p>

<h3 id="e110">The Dancer's Destiny <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 1 "A very pretty lady!"</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou replied: "No - not yet. As soon as I arrived here, I spoke a few words with Old Man Li and felt that this case was very complicated, so I told him to go upstairs and wait. I also assigned the three servants to three different locations and called you first. Then I called the police station and asked them to send a hearse. Because of the telephone line, it was delayed for a while. Then I found that bullet on this wall and started to extract it. Therefore, I haven't had time to take a closer look." After he finished speaking, he hurriedly walked out of the room.</p>
<p>While Ni Jinshou was explaining, Hawthorne had already reached out to open the drawer. There was indeed a small key left in the keyhole of the drawer lock. The key handle did not have any rings attached, so it was indeed easy to overlook. When Hawthorne opened the drawer, he did not turn the key, and the drawer opened easily, indicating that it had not been locked.</p>
<p>The things in the drawer seemed to be very noteworthy. The most striking thing was three large stacks of legal currency tied with hemp thread. It was estimated that each stack was about a thousand. There were also several men's photos. Although the sizes were not uniform, they were all "modern youths." In addition, there was a steel nickel-plated iron box key. Hawthorne glanced at the photos and flipped through many invitation cards and documents, only taking the key out of the drawer. He said, "This key must be for the iron box over there." He leaned sideways and pointed to the northwest corner of the reception room.</p>
<p>I began to make a quick tour of the room. A large square of expensive thick carpet was laid on the waxed narrow-strip chestnut floor, and the muddy footprints led to the carpet. To the right of the deceased's seat, behind him, was a small white stone-topped round table, surrounded by four exquisite leather-cushioned short-backed chairs. In addition to an imported copper vase, there was a silver-plated ashtray on the round table, with several cigarette butts in the ashtray. There were also two glasses, one with some leftover fragrant wine. Further to the right of this small round table, against the wall, was a purple velvet couch, with three circular brocade cushions, which were also imported without exception. On the armrest at the end of the couch lay a light blue velvet short coat, clearly taken off the deceased. (17)</p>
