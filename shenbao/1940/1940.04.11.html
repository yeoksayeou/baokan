<p>蔣議長　休會詞</p>
<p>重慶　參政會第五次大會閉幕式、蔣議長致休會詞、共要點如下、蔣議長首先對此次大會、表示欣慰、謂此次大會、特別有精神、所有議案、比前幾屆都切實精當、足令全國軍民感奮、本會是集合全國英賢才俊之士、大會愈開愈盛、愈開愈進步、正像我軍愈戰愈强、大會的審查報吿和提案、都是切實可行、且亦行得通、政府一定能充分接受、鄭重實行也、希望大家督促、國民一致努力來實行、繼述參政會兩年來的貢獻、最大的有二點、（一）實現精誠團結、自從本會成立至今、全國上下都能眞誠團結、確實做到集中意志，統一行動、同生死、共患難、由於本會的成立、政府和人民的意志已密切貫通、全國的賢能英傑、都矢忠輸誠、共同奮鬥、（二）支持抗戰國策、本會歷次開會、都有擁護抗戰大計的鄭重表示、我們兩年來抗戰旣定國策、一致貫澈經不動搖、祗有極少數不能堅持的、自甘暴棄、也已離開、（三）確立民治楷模、本會兩年來確已完全屛除了過去議會的弊病、一切開誠布公、絕沒有意氣用事、中國從漢唐以至於宋明、士大夫最大的惡習、就是各逞意氣、不惜犧牲國家利益、我們現在的情形、是完全不同、我們現在祗要一提到國家民族和抗戰、所有個人的意見、就完全可以犧牲、即此　點、證明我們可以成爲一個近代的國家、對國家前途實抱有無窮的希望、</p>
<p>最後蔣議長特別指出本屆大會所集中注意的三大要點、就是（一）誅斥日僞、（二）發展經濟、（三）實施憲政、逐段加以綜合的叙述、並說明其個人的意見與期望、（一）誅斥日偽、大會第一天全塲一致通過的通電、表現了我們整個民族嚴正的公意、通電中有數語揭破日方僞組織欺騙和陰謀、這一點於抗戰有很重大的關係、拿從前歷史來說、我們不怕國家衰弱祇怕邪正不分、是非不明、歷代亡國不但是士大夫尙意氣喪廉恥、而一般社會也是邪正混淆、黑白不分、以是人心麻木、不知不覺的陷於覆亡、我讀從前歷史看到金兵渡河的時候、謂南朝無人矣、覺得這句話最足警惕、南朝不是沒有人、是正氣消沉、正義喪亡、因之人不成其爲人、而敵人敢於相侵、所以最緊要的是發揚民族正氣昌明國家正義、明春秋之義、嚴　夏之判、現在僞組織以亡國爲和平妄想、顚倒黑白、搖動人心、所以本會　大的貢獻、就在明是非、別邪正、這一點祗要正氣存在、正義昌明、任何敵人決計亡不了中國、本會這一次表示在精神上足以懾服敵人、使奸邪喪魄、中國民衆現在精神力量的偉大、日本軍閥永遠不會認識的、日人祗知道硏究明末的歷史、但他全不知中華民國成立的歷史、他不知滿淸是怎樣覆亡的、民國是怎樣建立的、更不會想到我們中國的時代精神、和三民主義的力量、、現在他派遣阿部來做變相的朝鮮總監、這樣的侵凌侮辱、必然激動我們格外堅强的民族意識、日閥愈猖在兇狡、我們革命勝利的前途愈近、（二）發展經濟、本會同人最注意的抗戰期中的經濟、無論審查報吿、討論提案、對經濟方面特別的周鮮、這是很可欣慰的、但我有幾點意見、要順便說一下、就是中國的經濟不能和別國一樣看法、戰時經濟本來是愈持久愈困難、但現在中國抗戰已近三年、我們沒有基礎而能支持到現在固然是不容易的、也因爲我們地大物博人衆、食衣住的國民生活、祇要調劑統制得宜、發展生產得法、是不會有問題的、所以我對戰時經濟前途、確是很樂觀、當然各位、所憂慮之點是値得時刻警惕的、但祇要照着我們旣定的方案、和大會的建　案、政府人民通力合作、我可以說不獨能支持下去、而且就是情况冉困難、也一定能自力更生、現在的關鍵是在於人事未盡以後我們一定要按照實際、切實來做、這裏特別要提醒大家和一般國民的、就是要大家能特別的忍痛、特別的吃苦、我們要料想今後或將有十倍二十信的困難日子、要立定吃苦的決心、來担當這個困難、克服這個困難、我們要勤勞生產、要節約消費、也要改善一切經濟方面的辦法、政府格外負責、人民也格外勤奮堅忍、我們要以宋末南渡以後偏安怠惰、茍且偷生爲鑑、我們要特別的講氣節、重責任、勿使將士流血、同胞受苦、所造成的功績、前功盡鑒、所以貪污在所必懲、怠忽在所必棄、總之能忍痛、能吃苦、就必能達到抗戰勝利的目的、</p>
<p>（三）實施憲政、這一次會議、大家都熱心討論着憲政、雖因時間關係、還沒有得到圓滿的結論、但我們同人、會後一樣可以貢獻意見、本會當將期成會草案、和各人意見併送政府、待國民大會來作最後的決定、本人的意見、認爲制憲一事、是要完全替國家百年利害來打算、要借鑑於過去苦痛的敎訓和經騐、爲將來施行憲法時打定良好基礎、眞正爲國民造福利、所以我們不說要注重過去的歷史和國情、注重現在的事實和環境、更要顧到頒憲行憲以後的將來、要知道中國當前的任務、是求得國家的獨立自由和平等、而這一個任務的貫澈、需要十年二十年的勞力、尤其重要的、我認爲五權制度的精神、切不可以遠反、我們旣然要造成中國爲三民主義共和國、憲法的條文中間就不能有違反五權憲法的條款、如果認爲有一時不能做到、而應逐漸充實的、和逐漸改進的、當然有暫時變通的權宜、但切不可以規定於憲法以內、我認爲我們的憲草要有彈性、要求其條條可實行、最後蔣議長總結全文、對各位參政員的努力、表示感謝、還特別屬望大家以後一切要重視實際、一切不能離開現實、因爲救國是艱難辛苦的工作、我們不但身苦、我們的心也苦、我們國家尙未達到獨立平等的地位敵人還未驅除、建國還未成功、人民還很痛苦、國家還受着屈辱、教們切不可以大意、切不可忘却國家現實的痛苦、事事要脚踏實地、忍苦忍勞、團結一致的盡我們的至誠、盡我們的努力、要想想日人妄想侮弄我們、拆散我們、懈怠我們、其所希冀我們造成的是怎麼樣一個現象、所以各位同人一定要以實事求是的精神、來領導民衆、救起國家、回想到兩年來風雨同舟、患難相濟的經過，特別希望各位同人、爲國家盡辛勞、爲個人作諍友、共同一致、來達成我們神聖的使命、（十日電）</p>
<p>解決國共問題　將設立委員會</p>
<p>重慶　國民參政會、頃對國共合作問題、已議決設立一特別委員會、該委員會之職務、排除國共間一切困難、防止國共間之磨擦、及解決國民黨與其他各政黨間一切過去之困難、幷聞國共兩黨領袖、將共同硏討一方案、以期泯除界限、團結合作云、（合衆社十日電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>歐戰擴大與遠東</h3>
<p>斯　蒂那維亞的三個國家，瑞典挪威與芬蘭，一向以愛好自由相平著稱，其經濟和文化都有高度的發展，但因爲國小勢微，故對於歐洲種種糾紛，無不避之若凂，力求置身事外，直到最近蘇芬戰爭還是如此。此歐戰突由相持轉趨擴大，首當其衝的竟是丹麥挪威兩國。丹麥與斯干蒂那維亞半島隔海對峙，茲乃與挪威同成爲歐戰的重要戰塲，真是値得悼惜和同情。歐戰這一擴大的趨勢，無論從全世界福利着想，抑或從人類歷史的發展觀察，都是一個絕大的不幸。然而在交戰國本身而論，與其長相僵持，成爲慢性痼疾，終仍不免於以國運爲孤注，則其實無寧速求主力的決戰，早定勝負。如果這一次戰爭擴大的結果，加速了　武侵略國家的崩潰，及早奠定了公道而永久的眞實和平，則丹挪兩國此次縱然形成祭壇上的犧牲，也還是有益於世界福利人類文明。</p>
<p>目前歐戰縱已達到第二階段，其前途究將如何逐步發展，目前尙難驟作斷定，但那種蔑視國際公法，肆意欺凌弱小的行爲，必將引起全世界的斥責和怒火，終於要受公道和正義的最後制裁。我們深信最後制裁的實現，祗是時間問題；而從今日到實現之日，雖難預測其時間距離的遠近，但遠東方面有待制裁的現象之存在，距今已閱三年。我們深信世人在有形無形之中，所醞釀與促進的最後制裁，必因歐北與遠東兩方面的需要而確認實現最後制裁的加倍重要。</p>
<p>歐戰擴大，大　爲日本軍閥所認爲値得歡忻的發展吧。因爲英　的實力旣爲了歐北戰局而更受牽制，則其在遠東的地位當然爲之减色；日本却得因此而增加其在國際的比重。其實所增所臧，所得影響及於最後結果者，能有幾何？幸災樂禍，亦祗是無益的自慰而已。試作思量：如果日本不是在三十幾個月以來，被中國絆住在抗戰的泥淖當中，則日本在這一次歐戰中的收穫，當早已駕甘五年前而上之。如果蘇芬戰事不於一月以前停止言和，則到現在也正是日本向各交戰國大肆勒索的良妤時機。如果若此，則遠東將受日本宰制，而日本在國際的比重，幾得與美國爭衡了。乃事實上不然。現在日本一方面旣困於侵華戰爭愈陷愈深，無法擺脫，不僅失掉了攫取特殊經濟政治利益的良好時機，同時也因爲實力衰敝，國勢削弱而不復像在前次歐戰中那樣値得重視；另一方面，英法縱因以全力對付歐局，無暇顧及遠東，但置身歐戰之外者，尙有蘇聯和美國，始終將與抗戰中的中國同爲安定遠東的主要力量。所以歐戰縱已向外蔓延，日本在國際的此重，雖與英法相較，相對的增進，但所增者仍不足以挽救日本的頹勢，亦即並小能收穫漁人之利。</p>
<p>王於中國的抗戰國第，當局早已一再申明不受任何國際變化的影響；而歐戰擴大更使中國朝野發生我道不孤之感，更刺激了抵抗侵略的決心。不但如此，中國朝野必因此而强化其感念，即中國抗戰一舉，今已史顯著的具有整個國際的重要性；申言之，歐戰擴大之後，中國對於世界福利，人類文明，旣以抗戰分擔其重要的責任，亦必以抗戰提供其重要的貢獻。換一方面加以檢討，歐局的嚴重，歐戰的擴大，對於中國抗戰並無何等不良的影響。即如軍需器材，中國取給於英法兩國的，自始極少極少，幾等於零；何况中國早有大量存儲，而自造自給計畫亦已着着實施，突飛猛進，成就卓越；西北西南的　際通路也並未遭受阻塞。又如有關經濟的情形，則各交戰國對中國各種土產及軍需原料的需求當益趨殷切，間接也就是增加中國抗戰的物力。</p>
<p>美蘇兩國對於歐戰新階段的態度，當然關聯及淤遠東現局。但以目前情形來看，美蘇不但並沒有捲入戰事漩渦的跡象，幷且體察兩國的國策，皆是計畫的避免捲入漩禍。美國國策一向沉着而堅定，對於歐局固極感關切，對於侵略國家也深惡痛絕；其壓惡戰爭的情緒，則無論政府人民以及在朝在野各黨，直到現在爲止，還是始終一致；如果沒有特殊事變發生，則此種情緒不致有何改變。至於蘇聯，其處境自遠較美國爲複雜，且此次戰爭擴大又適發生在斯干蒂那維亞半島和波羅海入口，與蘇聯切身利益息息相關。但蘇聯自有其獨特立場與傳統國策，不會幹那種火中取栗蠢事。目前蘇聯態度雖較偏向德國一邊，且一再對英法多所非難，但蘇聯幫助德國旣有其一定限皮，更沒有對英法採敵對行動。英政府最近對蘇態度顯已遠較一月之前爲緩和，則只要北歐戰爭不向蘇聯邊境蔓延，蘇聯也很少有參與戰爭可能。因此種種，在歐戰擴大現象之下，有關遠東局熱凡百因素，可見其絕無變化；而所以安定遠東，創造遠東，還在於中國向抗戰勝利之途邁進！</p>

<p>外相繼述德國歷來之行動違反國際公法條款之各節、而曰、余料世人必信協約國決不能長此容忍此種彰明較著之不公道行爲、故協約國乃取應付之步驟、其一即在海中要衝敷設水雷是也、今日任何人之未處於能自衛之地位者遭遇德國之行動、皆無以自保其安全、此已事實昭彰矣、</p>

<h3>金融　匯兌看跌觀念驟淡　美金一度創緊價……午刻獲利轉賣旺</h3>
<p>外　匯昨日市況、因受海外匯兌、並對英竟暴跌九分一七五影響、故本市匯　美匯掛牌改縮一二五、退爲五元七五、乃創去年九月十九日以來之緊價、荷呂日匯亦縮、他如英匯等則均平定、至內盤情況、環境時變、人心恍惚、動作未能一貫、晨初因美英匯兌慘落、美匯即軟〇六二五、爲五元九〇六二五、英金則未有更動、稍頃日行正金等竟狂扒美金達五十萬元、投機商亦爭相收納、以四五月份美匯居多、備斯時美行對期貨美匯、源源供給、　爲狀甚平、但現貨美匯終呈疲軟之態、目一度見過五元八七五空前緊價、迨外電頓傳西門財　、闡述英鎊低弱、純屬匯兌統　後之常態、絕無顧慮必要、是以人心轉變、出　者紛起、某多額現貨美匯、市象步現　硬、收盤英金不變、出匯爲五元九三七五、合匯兌爲五元四角五分四三七五、結果比上日英平　續緊〇三一二五、期貨潛勢與現貨稍有恙別、　日期　見　　、</p>
<p>日行結進五十萬</p>
<p>晨　初以倫敦　條、近遠各長三七五、匯兌英對美·滬·法等各匯俱平、美對英跌九分三七五、對滬降二角五分、對法小五分二五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士一二五、美匯五元九〇六二五、較之前收、英平美緊〇六二五、乃匯兌續跌之故、開後日行與投機商同來扒入四五月期美匯、而有利亦結入現貨英金、但大通等行尚肯供給、故期貨市勢尚定、現貨美匯則續稍軟化、計做開現先令四瓣士一二五、及本月份美匯五元八四三七五與八三二五、並五月期美匯五元六五六二五與六二五、斯時現貨美匯縮爲五元八七五、但鮮開成交、匯豊掛牌揭曉、英平美縮一二五、白銀平衡稅揭曉升二分、此後港電突來吐出現貨美匯、而同時外電傳稱西門財相會聲稱英鎊價格趨低、此乃統治後之普通現象、故本地投機商匯兌看跌觀念驟淡、扒者預告寂然、反之引起獲利者出籠、故市勢漸形回硬、計港電吐予外行現貨美匯五元九二七五、及投機商塞予外行本月期美匯五元八七五、並五月份美匯五元六八七五、同時外行吐予華行上海現貨美匯五元九〇六二五、、午刻外行頗有實意、狀態續告　　、迄至收盤、現貨美匯已回達五元九三七五、英金則仍四辦士九六八七五、美匯五元六八七五、結果比上日現貨英平美緊〇三一二五、本月份亦英平美軟〇三一二五、五月期英美匯則均無　　、以後週三無市、</p>
<p>香港美匯又猛縮</p>
<p>香　港十日　三電、今晨　貨均不動、美匯現貨猛縮半元、爲廿一元四三七五、遠期有行無市、申匯現貨徵升五角、日匯現貨亦緊三元、爲九十元、十一時三十分告平、申匯現貨續升五角、爲三百六十元、其餘概無榮辱、下午週三無市、</p>
<p>天津英美均平定</p>
<p>天　津十日週三電、今晨匯市開盤告平、英匯現貨及申匯及「聯鈔」暗盤均無　　美匯現貨縮一五六二五、爲五元五六二五、</p>
<h3>外幣兎起鹘落</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市況、驚濤駭浪、起落其鉅英美金鎊始隨金價急　向　眾推進、嗣以金價同落、買齊順告消滅、英金票供求仍衡、美金票一度昂達十六元九角半、嗣已獲利者紛爭了結、最低會降至十六元六角三分、午後又高至十六元七角七分、香港票趨勢亦挺、荷蘭票斐律濱票需要不弱、坎拿大票需要頗殷、市價又高至一元三角四分、朝鮮票趨勢仍軟、晚市爲一元一角一份、做開各幣行情、詳載市價網、</p>
<h3>貼現再升三元半</h3>
<p>拆息亦大　分</p>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現準、續見上升、每千　之貼率、一度昂至七十元外、上午由六十七元左右步飛上至七十三元、十點後漸見回下、午刻退至六十九元、下午變動已小、在六十九元左右、比前日再生三元半、錢業公會拆息、早午兩市均掛二角一分、　　　分云、</p>
<h3>金市動盪不定　狂漲之後即又狂跌　終與前日未分榮辱</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市況、暴升後卒告回平、買賣及響頗大、致價極易動盪、晨開已狂漲四十五元、　五千七百元、乃因眾科本日匯兌猛跌即現之故、嗣當美匯　緊、買戶踵接、於供求不平中、續創五千七百五十元、黃金新紀錄、時開錢兌業　銀號收進最勇、　知此後佳景急變、原為外電傳至英國西門財相聲稱英鎊之挫跌、此則匯兌統治後之自然現象、對幣值絕無重大關碍、於是本市美匯遂見回長、且有不利買方傳說、霎時間因金號銀號及某證券幫職妜塞出、出籠只風盛　、使價一蹶不振、最低爲五千六百三十五元、反較隔昨小二十元、尚賴金號復扒、使得結果告平、仍爲五千六百五十五元、與上日相同、此午收提起十五元、最後價爲五千六百七十元、半天交易仍旺、約三千餘兩、銀樓飾金一度會創五百七十五元之空前項價、但旋即回平、海關金等仍告呆定、</p>
<p>烚赤又創新高價</p>
<p>自晨每條(十兩)、初開匯兌果縮九分三七五、美匯帶緊、是以人心挺秀、一開即跳四十五元、金號進銀號　共數十兩、爲五千七百元、嗣後美匯續報帶軟、買風更　、錢兌業證券幫等爭先搶進、未及十分鐘竟再狂抬五十元、銀號進同業十兩、爲五千七百五十元、不意共時、某金號乘高猛塞、且某證券幫亦力售、繼後回落數十元、後再以美匯突報回長、一時買氣更濃、回入五千七百元大關、金號出錢兌業五十兩、爲五千六百七十五元、旋乃某金號忽來復進、且同時銀號等亦代散戶拖入、且斯時美匯轉定、復漲三十五元、金號進錢兌業等五十兩、爲五千七百十元、後以外匯美金重告走　、加之某證券幫見機再賣、不久復回入五千七百元大關、後再加銀號幫亦來猛塞、一時賣瘋由小而大、再回瀉數十元、銀號出證券幫二十兩、　至五千六百三十五元、午刻賣者漸少、而某金號忽來搜買、步漲四十五元、金號進銀號三十兩、爲五千六百八十元、將近收盤時、另一金號力賣、回低二十五元、金號售予證券幫三十兩、爲五千六百五十五元、作午收價、午後週五無市、結果比上日無分榮辱、半天一百十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照　赤　高數元、收進減低二十元、現標金照掛牌金　五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>首飾金高後又回</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出初時大同行仍　五百七十元、迨至九時半掛大五元、時創五百七十五元之空前高價、迨十一時十分回小五元、此後無變化、結果大同行依然　五百七十元、新同行與上價相同、收進減低十五元光景、</p>
<h3>紗花　市氣激昂　紗價直上</h3>
<p>變馬抬至一二七五元</p>
<p>紗　市猛漲、及歐洲戰專有擴大模樣、黃金昂　、致人心激昂、掀起買風、市面乃直上雲霄矣、二十支變馬現貨高　惠達一千二百七十五元、收　價爲一千二百五十四元、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、聞英美匯兌大跌、匯市趨縮、人心振作、二十支　馬現貨價爲一千二百五十元、此時賣者寥寥、同時粵幫需要雖不及上日之旺、然零星交易尚不間斷、故氣勢仍挺、漲至一千二百七十五元、旋以獲利者吐出、回挫至一千二百五十元、查半日間成交統計一千七百九十五包、行情二十支變馬漲五十六元、今日有紗五十一件運天津、茲將各幫口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>同行　一、三三五　香港</p>
<p>統計　一、七九五</p>
<h3>同業爭購　棉價激漲</h3>
<p>本　棉交易略形起色、不過傳係同行互相買賣、此因紗價節節飛騰、致唇齒相依之原棉帶起一步、惟廠方動辦尙鮮、所以各花均漲三四五元、茲將現棉成交情形列左、</p>
<p>另　訊、外棉市價、紐約棉市晨初即因利物浦來電良好、及印度棉市堅定而漲、後因歐洲局勢之突變、引起海外商之在市購買、結果收盤價格較之上日近期漲四五磅音、遠期漲六磅音、印度棉市亦因歐局關係、購買者異常踴躍、昨日連同預測猛漲十八羅比、埃及漲十餘磅音、</p>
<p>滬　埠外棉交易、昨日因海外棉市之狂騰、紗價亦步跟、各同業深慮印棉運滬船艘、恐生困難、故在市　購現貨頗烈、售價較之期貨反見高昂、然雖出高價、亦難以購得大量者、茲將昨日棉市以美匯五元九三七五折合送廠價如下、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布上漲仍烈</h3>
<p>昨棉布漲風、氣焰仍盛、再創新高價、白貨細布·斜紋·粗布上午每　漲五角至一元、午後續升五角左右、漂染布市面混沌、更無確價、大致每　漲一元左右、本街業內外囤戶續購大鵬·富貴·三　·細布·斜紋·怡和等廠粗布五百餘件、　布近六百件、粵幫辦色布·色斜·府綢·漂布·二百餘件、豫·皖·幫辦色布·條漂布·府綢一百數十件、川滇幫辦士林布·細布·印花布一百餘件、浙路溫台甬幫辦細布·粗布·斜紋一百五六十件、國外新加坡辦漂染布五千餘　、又十一日　頭運天津四件、</p>
<h3>呢絨多向英定</h3>
<p>意大利貨須用美金</p>
<p>英國製呢絨、　來業中一般大批發戶、大有定貨、蓋以申市貨價高漲、各貨軋缺、而英貨仍用先令、且無須付　銀、而意大利定貨、行方接機戶來電、一律改用美金、故上漲比英貨為貴、兼大多數尙須先付三成定銀、致造成英　呢絨定貨營業擴大、</p>
<h3>證券　統丙賣出甚多</h3>
<p>洋股無甚特色</p>
<p>證　券暗盤、昨日市況丙種舉行抽籤、行市乃告不振、但觀各戶之需要仍殷、尙不致　爾引起跌風、惟金市之疊見高漲、人心因之稍軟、已無以前興奮氣象、前途或將起一度之盤旋、昨日經過、上午因一般不中籤之丙種　破五十元關、乙種亦打破二元、買戶雖尙熱鬧、但已為賣氣所籠罩、惟跌落較多、午後又為多方佔優勢、各項均見回上二三角、而買戶猶有餘勇、市況乃趨堅定、結果一致續小一二角至四角半不等、成交繼數共計約一百二十萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股　票交易、成交華商電氣股一百五十股、價為七元九角、</p>
<p>衆業股市無甚特色、價格殊鮮波動、開盤行情、與前收同、嗣因買方乘低來購、市況略有進步、後轉寗靜、在　　不定之現狀下、股市行動、若是良佳、未可厚非、橡皮股因國外現貨價大漲、稍有轉機、但買者似不躁急、價格遂亦平平、</p>
<p>倫　敦九日週二電、今日英商遠東各公司股票掛牌行市、僅古拉客林傍橡皮股跌落三便士、價為十八先令六便士、其餘告平、</p>
<p>倫敦九日（週二）電、今日中國外債掛牌、仍高平穩、上下檔各債券　無變動、</p>
<h3>美靈登公司派息</h3>
<p>美商美靈登有限公司、第十次股東常年大會、定於四月二十六日舉行、一九三九年益餘據報達國幣九萬一千餘元、股　擬派年息一分、</p>
<h3>糧食　米價反動回漲</h3>
<p>米市目前晨再度暴跌、午市即復轉禁、昨則以內地國米來源不多、由虹口輸出共祗一千餘包、及金價高漲、匯價續縮、客販又復持貨待機、鄉莊及客戶店舖、多方搜求、早市國洋兩米、悉見節節高升、若國米　見早晚稻已開四十元三十九元半、蘇同幫宿粉粳四十元、　丹糯米三十七元半、次至三十五元、而洋米一號西貢四十二元二角、四十二元、較之前盤、猛提一二元不等、且聞塲外暗盤、相互並起、常幫特粳為四十三元、崑粳四十二元半、四十二元、青泗特薄四十二元出零、江北尖四十元、惟大局變化多端、雖一朝回昂、人心未免尙懷戒　、況一轟太高、又感棘手、所以午市銷塲復見遜色、行情回貶二三角、</p>
<p>洋　米不斷來滬、昨日太古公司慶元輪到埠、自香港運來三千零二十四包、今日怡和洋行利生輪赴華北、有洋米五百包運往天津、</p>
<p>昨　洋米被匯縮金漲之激動、市面頗有鉅大致呼吸、晨間買氣極旺、尤以業內外投機與浮戶吸收為最貪、蓋因匯水既縮、產價又高、人心頓時向上、一號西貢前日收價四十元〇五角者、抬高至四十二元半、一號亦接近四十元、火絞至四十一元、其他高次各檔　致上升、比之前日較大二元之譜、旋因浮戶獲利出籠、且傳內地大量杜米即將運申、人心頓時軟化、行情立小半元至近元、午後形勢續疲、結果祗較大一元許、回範期西貢二號四五月份早市五十元、午後祗四十九元半、又現交開四十六元半、全日成交期貨三百噸、現貨六千包、</p>
<h3>麥粉稍緊</h3>
<p>麵　粉稍緊、蓋緣歐洲戰事擴大、黃金暴漲、米價上勝、人心莫不帶緊、惟客稍呆滯、市面亦難　開展、　　粉　盤、堅站不動、老車　回憶繼粉初時喊價與　盤相　、上午一度擴持、聞後市開通十三元四角、但無實際成交、祗內地粉稍有本客之購動、計開雙獅牌十三元九角、山鹿牌十二元八角半、比前微昂數分、又聞洋砲台開價十三元七角、倂計各粉成交、約有一萬餘包、</p>
<p>麥　市交易、殊見清閒、蓋述日盛傳大批洋麥將到、人心頗為鬆濫、今以歐戰時局嚴重、國外來源恐受阻碍、定麥合價尤高、故執貨者售意復挺、惟華廠進胃怠懈、市面亦鮮開展、結果由廠辦蘇州麥五六百包、價站二十二元原盤、</p>
<h3>油市　生油續漲元外</h3>
<p>昨日豆油及花生油市況、依然分道而馳、花生油在香港幫辦胃蟬聯之下、行囤胃口益健、行情續漲一元半、豆油則實銷平淡、乏力發展、統市計開大連豆油一百五十桶、價目一百零五元開盤、中途為一百零四元半、後復至一百零五元、收盤為一百零五元二角、又大有廠豆油成交一百擔、價為八十一元五角、花生油做　　州油四百件、價為七十四元五角、青島油三百桶、價為一百零五元至零六元、江北聽裝油四百聽、價為一百零一元云、</p>
<h3>煤炭　白煤漲價</h3>
<p>煤球亦抬價</p>
<p>鴻基白煤、自入春以來、到源日見稀少、而各廠因改裝爐灶、去路則反見旺盛、以致供求失衡、價乃蒸蒸日上、日昨鴻基白煤同業行拆、續漲五元、每噸一百七十元、鴻基二號屑（煤球原料）加八元、計一百十八元、因是煤球公會開緊急會議、自即日起、義泰興南洋廠盤一律加上八元、門莊發客、每噸一百四十元送到、每噸十七元五角、每擔　售七元云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　歐戰擴大　日美絲價回昂　本市亦形活躍</h3>

<h3>藥材　山瓜蔞缺貨</h3>
<p>山　柰以來源暫斷、故此間所銷僅賴去冬存貨、以資　注、目前將次售完、行家雖尚有小數交易、其價竟售八十元、茲聞某號已直接向汕頭辦妥一批、在設法裝運中、大約月內方可抵滬、</p>
<p>瓜　蔞最近到過一批以適當銷令、隨即售開、計瓜蔞皮為一百五十五元、瓜蔞子一百五十元、惟來貨數量尙少、似覺求國於供、其勢至為堅穩、</p>

<h3>丈夫是愛情的創造者</h3>
<p>妻子是愛情的儲蓄銀行……</p>
<p>無疑的在夫婦間愛情上丈夫是處於主動的創造者的地位。一個　明的丈夫，不但他對於妻子的性格很明白，甚至他對於妻子生理的特徵需要和變化，也一定瞭然。然後施展着他的愛的技巧，來對於愛的藝術品的創作。所以有着許多的女郎，在娘家時性情是很驕傲者，可是嫁了丈夫，就一變為小鳥依人的樣子了。也有在未嫁前生活享用是很豪奢的，可是嫁後就突然的變成了一個克勤克儉的主婦了。她把丈夫所創造下的愛情，和工作所賺來的錢款，統統的儲蓄起來，結果，她變成了一個愛情豐富的女人，他們的家庭也變成經濟充裕的家庭了。尤足奇怪者，妻子的身心也每每隨丈夫的願望而改變，瘦的會變胖的，衰弱的醜陋的會成健美的，乳峯的秀美，曲線的明朗，這女子常常於婚後而益顯。至於他們共同生育的伶俐而活潑的子女，那更是他們的活寶貝。所以說：最滿意的愛人，並不是天成的，而是人工的，這句話實有深長的意味。</p>
<p>丈夫既是愛情的創造者，就應得好好地從事你的愛情的美麗的創作。齊家治國平天下，由此出發也未始不是正途。不過，創造就須要有創造的精力，丈夫誠能精強力壯，妻妾自多美妙恩情，夫妻既多恩情，自然就可以得心應手，創造成一個美滿家庭。若男子欲早年曾犯自瀆縱欲，摧殘了生殖腺內分泌機能，致患有遺精，腎虧，陽痿不舉，發育不全，神經衰弱等症者，那於婚後，既不能安慰妻子的芳心，在夫婦生活上更將惹妻子的憎恨，這樣，何從發生愛情，即前日已有之愛情，亦將因此而陷於毀滅！一對無愛情的夫婦，日間則如眼中之釘，晚間則同床異夢，心中的痛苦為何似耶？因痛苦而愁忿，而憎恨，則雖性情溫婉的女郎亦一變為性情暴戾的河東獅了，體能健美的少婦亦一變為痿黃多的怨婦了。或竟因性情的激辯，演出私奔，自殺，離婚等悲劇者，在今日社會新聞中亦時有所見！</p>
<p>為丈夫者精力的重要既如此，則不幸已有上述症象者，即須及早醫治。治法；據世界名醫及於余等經騐均以服健壯動物生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』最為對症特效。因此劑係由健壯動物如獅虎，猩猩，熊鹿，海狗等體中提取的生殖腺內分泌精華，用科學複製法製成，所以品質名貴，功效確實，為任何類似製劑所不及。男子於服後一日夜間即可生精補腎，健腦活血，連服一月，更能助長發育，滋養神經，必能根治各症，使精力增強，中老年人常服則延年益壽返老還童。惟患遺精者，須兼服『希米脫氏固精片』（中西五洲等大藥房及永安公司西藥部均售每匣兩元）以固精關，制止遺洩，則收效尤速。</p>
<p>健美</p>
<h3>乳峯萎的影響如何？</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>一個乳峯高聳，臀部　腴，腰身　細，曲縣明顯的健美少女，的確好像是社會由的　　，到處香噴噴，甜蜜蜜，為人尊敬，為人追求，她不但在物質上佔盡種種便宜，即於身心上，亦非　　乳峯萎　，臀部瘦削，健美喪失的女性　　同日而語。蓋乳峯的所以能夠高聳而富彈性，據醫學上的論斷，全仗自身卵巢機能的健全，新陳代謝作用的旺盛，學業內都充滿新生細胞，由是特徵發達面色紅潤，肌膚細膩，思想敏捷，性情柔和，雖遇難　當前，亦可當機立斷，雖遇不擇之事，亦可從容任之，不致煩囂暴怒。心胸豁朗，意志堅強，此等女性，一旦出嫁以後，夫婦間的感情必非常濃厚，粗織快樂的家庭，生育的賢妻良母啊？但乳峯萎　，臀部瘦削，健美喪失的女子，不特無此幸福，抑且多病多痛，極盡人世之慘！唯一補救之法。據中西醫師及余經騐，祗有服生殖腺卵巢內分泌製劑女用「生殖素」最為對症而特效。此劑由世界著名生理學大師斯丹那博士積三十餘年艱辛實騐而發明，成分除採少壯動物的卵巢腺，肝膏，腦下垂體外。更和以礦植物之　，鐵，錳與維他命多種，在最完善的科學設備下，精密監製，故藥性非常和平，而藥力則完全保存，且毫無副作用，不分寒暑，均可常服，倘在此玩物勃興的季春服之，尤可事半功倍，能使萎　的乳峯，在短期內立顯高聳，解除身體上各種病態，促進新陳代謝。紅潤面頰，增進健美。</p>
<h3>遺精青年春暖後的悲慘</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>「因人天氣日初長」。春暖洋洋的天氣是最易使人困倦的！尤其是遺精青年，因為精力的虧耗，一至春暖後，常感頭昏腦脹，記憶不良，思想昏沉，校中功課，即難進步；若在職業界工作，稍一操勞每感腰酸背痛，難能勝任，若已結婚，則在夫婦生活上，常有精力早衰，陽痿現象，或因遺精已久，而致發育不全，精力早衰，竟完全不能人道者亦有之，則青春幸福豈不也斷送了嗎？所以遺精青年，務須當機立斷，從速作根治之計，若因循　且，精力日漸虧損，則春暖後的悲慘，是不堪設想的！</p>
<p>男子的精液，好好的深藏在精　裏，何以會不出自主地遺洩呢？這據醫學上論斷：大都因早年曾犯自瀆縱欲，　傷了性神經，使精關弛鬆之故。所以欲根本治愈遺精，亦必須以鞏固精關為上策。德國著名治遺特效藥『希米脫氏固精片』即完全具備此種功效。患者於臨睡前用開水吞服三片，則當夜收安眠養神，鞏固精關根治遺精之特效。如因遺精已有上述症象者須兼服健壯動物生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，助長發育，若能不斷連服，必於短期內治愈各症，使精力豐足，頭腦清明，誠有精力有思想有能幹之青年人，則前途豈可限量！若患者為審慎起見，能親來本診所兼施電療注射等新藝術，更可保證治愈。</p>

<h3>於無意中轉入慢性淋</h3>
<p>在初發之急性症狀，往往于不知不覺中轉入慢性淋病者，以余歷年來經騐之結果，蓋除淋菌而外，又多混有其他之病菌，尤其是起於桿菌者最多。患者之自覺症為尿道不快擾癢感，或於輕微的疼痛，始乞醫家診治。惟由於症状之輕微，故二使病家疏於治療與攝生，故于不知不覺之　，將淋菌由前尿道侵入後尿道，遂致惹起攝護腺炎，精囊炎，睾丸炎，膀胱炎，及全身傳染之關節炎等，始知自己之病非但未　，反而已趨惡化。</p>
<p>有時，此等症壯，其尿液並不完全混濁，多呈透明色，或略帶少許之淋系而已。但是實際上此等塲所，恒在無意之中，傳染於異性，故已有妻子之丈夫，尤不可不留意於此等慢性淋之症狀，而求其即日治愈。凡是遇到此等症狀時，必須用尿液培養後，反覆檢查，或行攝護腺按摩法，將其漓出之液體，用顯微鏡檢查之，必能發見淋菌及其他桿菌，而確定淋病之所在，然後按症而治，庶幾百發百中，在治療方法上言之，則首推德國濾淋平流電療法，以其導子插入尿道內部，然後按病情之輕重而開放電度，使殺菌力直接投射病灶，適可而止。並擇用德國希氏血清，以抗淋殺菌免疫，他如洗滌法，按摩法，冷卻法，溫湯法等，皆可按症而施，則凡如此等症之慢性淋，四五星期即可根治也兼治梅毒，　　，下　。及無痛苦新法割除包皮。</p>

<h3>今日董事競選結果　覘租界未來命運　昨日兩處投票五千餘張　英美候選人昨已佔優勢　租界有史以來最緊張之一頁</h3>
<p>本年工部局董事競　、　公共租界歷史上七十年來　緊張之一幕、已於昨日展開、係分兩地投票、一在福州路尤國商團操練廳、一在虹口小菜塲、於昨日上午起至今日下午二時止於（一）阿樂滿·（二）卞納·（三）田誠·（四）海萊·（五）塙雄太郎·（六）凱自威·（七）黑田慶太郞·（八）羅特立克麥唐納·（九）雷諾爾麥唐納·（十）密啟爾·（十一）岡本一策·（十二）岡本乙一·（十三）鮑威爾等十三人中、選舉九人爲工部局董事英美方面以日方企圖攫取租界行政管理權、突將候選人增加至五名之多、深知其用心所在、爲保持租界現狀及維護　在租界所擁有權益計、乃組微聯合陣綫、採取一致步驟、以全力與日方相周旋、其他各國在滬納稅人、初以惑於日方甘言誘引、及對工部局目前財務行政上措施不滿、少數納稅人頗有擁護日僑納稅人之趨勢、惟多數深明大義者、熟籌利害、權衡輕重、怵於日方在佔領區內排除第三國權益之殷鑒、加之英美方面之連日大聲疾呼、整個局勢、業已轉變、吾人此時固不能逆料競選結果、勝利究屬何方、但爲正義公道計、爲上海居民安全計、自不欲漢口法租界·天津英租界·厦門公其租界之運命、光臨於海上也茲將昨日緊張情形、分誌於後、</p>
<p>兩處選票　數目相</p>
<p>上海西橋納稅人、昨日已開始投票、據萬國商團操練塲及虹口小菜塲收票處報吿、截至下午三時、兩處計收約共五千餘票、據目擊者談、收票處之最大困難、厥為過分擁擠、而各紅領巾稅人於投票前、須先檢查其名字已否登記、而負檢查之責者、依照其姓名之第一字母、分別檢騐、昨日專負檢查A「B」「C」一字母者、僅有二人、彼等工作過分忙碌、以致將選舉票投人箱內、需費極長之時間、但專負檢查「X」「Y「Z」字母者之二人、則工作極閒、應付裕如、而投票之事、進行亦頗迅速、據萬國商團操練塲收票處之報吿、該處共收得三千票、據美僑方面消息、截止昨日、美僑納稅人之未投票者、巳屬少數、美僑協會今日將繼續勸納稅人勿放棄權利、英僑投票者爲數亦衆、今日當可更多於昨、故據一般推測、今日投票情形、當更形緊張、截至今日下午三時止、全部當可收得一萬餘票、</p>
<p>虹口猶人　執迷不悟</p>
<p>據虹口小菜塲投票處報吿、截止昨日下午三時爲止、共收二千五百票、共中日僑納稅人所投者、約計爲二千二百票、猶太難民及猶僑所投者、約計三百票、據稱、昨晨九時二十分、即開始投票前四十分鐘、虹口收票處即有日僑二百餘人佇候門首、至十時、增至六百餘人、投票開始後、彼輩更蜂擁而至、間有日籍婦女及西僑雜於其閒、全日秩序尙佳、僅有一人因遺失入塲證而要求補發、同時親日猶人、則在虹口各地張貼標語、其言云、「勿忘吾人係居住虹口、」作為擁護日僑候選人之理由、據悉、在兆豐路日方選舉委員會辦事處中、昨整日有若千猶人工作、極爲忙碌、據稱、目前已有猶人二百五十餘人被彼等吸引至橋北、投票贊助日僑候選人、彼等妄想日人援助彼等之親友、能逃出歐洲火坑、而來上海、</p>
<p>日人奢望　無從實現</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、工部局下屆董事競選、今（十一日）晨開始投票、大批納稅人紛赴工部局大厦內商團敎練所與虹口菜塲兩投票塲投票、整日絡繹不絕、英美日僑民選舉委員會均促其僑民全體參加投票、工作繁忙、前所未有、據消息靈通人士預料、英美候選人當可得多數票、日人奢望排斥英美候選人三名、有如水中撈月云、</p>
<p>納稅日人　到塲最早</p>
<p>最先抵工部局大厦投票者、爲納稅日人、其數殊衆、致他國僑民到塲稍遲者、均待於後、鵠候良久、依次而入、投票塲前、有日方所派監察員一隊、審愼計算入塲人數、在筆記簿錄下數目、外面亦有便衣日人四名、虹口菜塲投票塲入口、並有日方特設問訊處、此乃事先獲得許可者、</p>
<p>投票佈置　甚為週密</p>
<p>工部局方面鑒於本年投票者甚夥、事前已有妥善佈置、如在兩投票塲中添設投票櫃、及增多發票桌、並加分類、投票入塲、須出示投票證、經檢騐無訛、始能領取選舉票塡寫後投入票櫃、</p>
<p>兩處均有　專人照料</p>
<p>工部局大厦投票塲負責人爲財務處副處長密特爾頓、管理虹口菜塲者爲稅務處康茂萊、各有助手多人、襄助照料、今日各報刋　廣告、囑納稅人弗選英僑獨立候選人雷諾麥唐納、雷氏乃飭人在投票塲散發傳單、請投票選舉「第九號英僑獨立候選人雷諾麥唐納」、</p>
<p>英美方面　最後活動</p>
<p>美僑選舉委員會在美國總會特掛電話綫六條、今晨逐一發電話通知全體納稅美僑及早投票、英僑選舉委員會活動月餘、至今日最甚、預料參加投票之納稅英人、遠較平時爲多、兩委員會且爲英美納稅人便利計、特派車輛接送僑民、到塲投票、</p>
<p>今日增添　收票櫃桌</p>
<p>工部局方面、以日僑突將候選人增加至五名之多、而自詡爲可獲得多數納稅人之投票擁護、英美僑民方面、亦以勢非爭取勝利、不能維持其權益、乃大事活動、投票者亦必踴躍、致所設之收票處擁擠不堪、爲適應需要計、決於今日在虹口小菜塲及萬國商團操練廳、分別增加收票處若干、期能於二日內完成投票、</p>
<p>日先民册　覆查未竣</p>
<p>工部局對於日方所造選舉名册、恐有浮濫情弊、爰着收稅課派員覆查、以明瞭各間接納稅者、是否均合選舉人資格、但因時間倉卒、調查工作、未能普遍、爲免與日方發生衝突、對於未經覆查者、特按照名冊給與選舉證、</p>
<p>林雄吉等　數夜不眠</p>
<p>日方爲達到選舉勝利、以便操縱租界行政、在組織與宣傳上、拚命工作、林雄吉等一般選舉委員、因此數夜未眠、前日虹口一帶、到處可遇見日本選舉委員會所貼之傳單標語、鼓勵日本人有選舉權者、「勿放棄貴重的一票」、「選舉日籍五候選人」、「勿忘在選舉票上署名」、大陸新報昨日且以「逮設上海新秩序」之大標題、排爲第一條新聞、鼓吹「以選舉戰的勝利、在上海實施東亞新秩序的原則」、林雄吉復於九日夜間、發表聲明、謂維持現狀、雖嘗爲世人所支持、但時勢變遷、此種觀念、已難存在、日本人必須打破上海租界現狀、建設「新秩序」、此　選舉戰、即爲現狀打破戰的第一着、此戰勝敗之數、雖難逆覩、但日人務須傾其全力、貫澈對上海租界所抱之主張」云、觀此、則日方獨佔上海權益、消滅歐美各國在滬地位之野心、實已情急至極、不遑自諱矣、日方爲選舉失敗後、有所藉口、以與工部局爲難起見、昨在日文報紙上、製造種種消息、攻擊工部局、謂許多猶太人咖啡店、有工部局所派之英籍警員、對猶太選舉人作示威的勸誘、並有英警員挨戶向猶太人作宣傳、囑其投票選舉英美候選人、</p>
<p>日發言人　絃外之音</p>
<p>日大使館發言人、昨日在招待新聞記者席上、竟稱英美僑關於此次競舉之宣傳、幾完全失去效用、據稱、一英美方面所持之理由無非爲日方企圖統制租界，而排斥英美在華權益、彼等甚至更暗示租界秩序將因此而發生極大糾紛、但不論選舉之結果如何、渠認爲租界應絕對保持國際化、」而日人能在工部局中佔有更佳之位置、又稱、日方所希望者、乃對租界行政遂漸予以改進、而成爲完全國際化、發言人復又宣稱、目今日方已由一英人、一荷蘭人、一華人、及一日人、組成委員會、專事研究如何使租界國際化之問題、並表示願其他各國僑民、亦參加此委員會、最後、發言人又認爲此次選舉結果、非五日僑候選人全部中選、即全部落選、</p>
<h3>西報嚴切注意　本屆選舉結果　揭發日人一切內在陰謀　勿令上海遭天津之命運</h3>
<p>工部局本屆董事選舉情形之緊張、可於日文報紙及西文報紙之記載中見之、昨日西文各報、除顯明標題「競選開始外、字林西報復於封面上刊有巨幅廣吿、載明選舉票之式樣、於英美僑候選人姓名之左、均附以「X」之記號、指示納稅人投票時、採取一致之行動、於雷諾麥唐納及日僑候選人姓名下、則大書「任其空白」一語、並以箭頭、指示空白處、大陸報第五版、刊有較字林西報史大之廣吿、幾佔全版之半、上書「美僑協會請每登記之投票者、及早投票贊助英美七候選人、泰晤士報則著有長評、述評其事、大陸報之社論、態度更爲積極、且地位刊於歐戰評論前、可知英美人士對此次競選之重視、</p>
<p>上海前途　繫於今日</p>
<p>大陸報昨刋社評題曰「上海在十字路口」、略稱、上海公共租界之前途、今操本市選舉人之手、若輩將於今日投票定工部局現狀、將否予以維持、當於選舉結果覘之、在今明兩日中、最重要之問題、厥爲公共租界之國際地位、將否予以保全、抑由日人控制、致本市成日本帝國之前哨、至於工部局之浪費政策及行政效力等問題、則皆不入競選政綱矣、特工部局之財政行政方針、苟須改革、亦須展緩至公共租界之安全所受威脅消滅之後、始可行之、日人謀用競選方式、獲取公共租界統制權其根本目的、不難測知、日方候選人及官方發言人曾謂日方目的、厥欲使公共租界具備近代化及節約之行政機關、此乃欺人之談、要知日方推舉候選人五名、其志若在改革、則今有無可駁斥之事實、可爲反證、即日人最好先對滬西界外馬路區力加整頓、該區需要公正而有效之行政機關、遠較公共租界本身尤爲迫切、抑日人在中國淪陷城市及上海四郊、並未表示其有培植公正有效的行政機關之能力或意響、足見日人苟接管工部局、必不能在公共租界植立較爲有效而公正之行政制度、日人所謂志在改革、無非競選時之措辭、其唯一目的、端在置此國際都市於該國軍事經濟與政治控制之下、要可斷言、</p>
<p>西僑揭發　日人野心</p>
<p>（一）某西僑納稅人昨日投函字林西報、對日方控制租界野心、大加指摘、據稱、「一般人有以爲日方統制租界行政後、必不致使租界情形更形惡化、且或可改進現狀、實則大謬不然、蓋被日方統制後之</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>租界、吾人可以虹口南市爲殷鑒、今虹口南市、仍爲个片荒土、此並非由於市民生活水準之高漲不易恢復舊觀、實足以證明日人之力量究何如也、或謂日方統制虹口南市、乃係軍事行動、而非政治手腕、故地方之恢復原狀也甚難、此言固具相當理由、但證之越界築路區域情形、如日人在虹口之擅捕某俄婦及擾亂美商廣播電台、以及日軍之繼續封鎖長江珠江諸端而言、西人對於日人、實無法予以同情、故任何西僑、如不認淸目標、而於此次選舉中、投票贊助日僑候選人、則一旦租界被日軍統制、則將難辭其咎、將來必自食其果、」該屆復對獨立候選人雷諾麥唐納之參加、亦攻擊甚力、彼大聲疾呼、籲請西僑納稅人投票選舉英美七候選人、蓋深恐雷諾麥唐納分散七人之票數、致日人僥倖得逞、此事關係重大、故彼喚起西僑納稅人之密切注意、該屆中復列一表、估計雙方可得之票數、認西僑納稅人四千人均票選舉五英僑候選人、則爲二萬票、每人平均獲四千票、足以超過日僑候選者每人所可獲得之三千七百票、如麥唐納氏亦被列入、則英候選人增至六人、以六人分二萬票、每人僅能獲得三千三百三十三票左右、此數顯然不能與日人抗衡、</p>
<p>葡萄牙人　擁護英美</p>
<p>（二）此外昨日又有一葡籍納稅人、亦函字林西報、表示渠認爲葡人應全部選舉英美候選人以保持租界原有狀態、蓋渠認葡人在滬及港者、半世紀來、均與英美方面合作、而獲取其生存條件、故葡人應絕對感激英美僑民、而希望保持現狀、渠繼又稱、彼等雖對日人並無惡感、但皆願租界行政、山英美僑民、保持共原狀、</p>
<p>日人陰謀　最後一着</p>
<p>今日出版之中國評論週報稱、日人聲言將虹口警權歸還工都局之事、僅爲日人企圖攫取租界行政權之一種手叚、蓋日由此可打破歷來認虹口爲「特殊狀况」之見解、而使每一日僑納稅人、即使居住於虹口區域者、亦可有投票贊助日僑候選人之機會、該文認爲此舉實爲日人企圖攫取租界行政之最後一著、但以美國對之採取絕對强硬態度、必失敗無疑、如美僑一旦不過問工部局行政管理權、则上海租界、勢必遭遇天津租界之同樣命運、該文復認爲日人此舉、爲其對於租界一貫野心下之新姿態、</p>

<h3>弒父案上訴昨開審　周欽祥自認單獨行兇　周欽吉翻供否認參予謀殺　年齡均有問題其母實冤枉　不滿法醫報告請重行鑑定</h3>
<p>曾經轟傳社會去歲十二月五日滬西梅格路二二八號發生之兩道子甬人周欽吉欽祥況弟殺死生父周永杰，事後並與生母周經氏將屍支解、用鏹水溶化、以圖毀屍滅跡、被死者長女周欽珠報告靜安寺捕房、將母子三人拘獲、解送第一特院、判決兩逆子殺害尊親均處極刑、周紅氏帮切毀屍、徒刑二年六月、詳情曾誌本報、三被告奉判不服、分延楊遵知、葉少英。姜屏藩律師向江蘇高二分院</p>
<p>提起上訴　並主張兩逆子甬有遺傳性精神傷耗症、故由高院先行指令第一特院法醫對兩逆子予以鑑定完畢、由法醫作成報告、呈送高院、乃由承審推事定於昨日下午提訊、按照現時狀態、所有高二分院不論民刑訟案、均在威海衛路重慶路臨時院址開庭、但此案因情節重大、開庭時旁聽者勢必衆多、該處庭址狹小、乃決定暫借北浙江路第一特院刑事第二庭審理、而所發之旁聽券百餘紙、則早已具領一空、故昨午後二時許、刑二庭已滿坑滿谷、至無券而被擯諸門外者、為數亦殊不少、二時四十分由承審庭長聶車義。偕陪審推事石美瑜。賣振聲。檢察官林我朋。暨書記官</p>
<p>升座開庭</p>
<p>首提三上訴人至案、周欽吉欽祥兄弟衣去歲被捕時之灰色長袍、但形容憔悴、周經氏則衣女犯制服、胸前訂有三九〇號碼、聶庭長首訊三上訴人年籍時、欽吉欽祥對第一審所供年歲二十四歲與二十一歲忽然變更、欽吉稱實係二十一歲、欽祥稱僅十八歲、聶庭長為愼重計、採用隔別訊問，諭將三上訴人暫行押下後、首先訊問周經氏之內奸句容人陳人驥證稱、（在海關任稽查、家住斜橋弄天樂坊四號）大致謂死者生前坐性怪僻、伊夫妻感情素甚惡劣即親戚閒亦極少交往、尤其對兩子待遇尤苛、時常打罵、且一度停止供給讀書、並稱周繩氏確有心臟病、其兩子有無精神病、及此次殺死生父究屬何故抑為財產、不得而知、繼即提周欽吉到案、訊以上訴理由、而欽吉對第一審承認與其弟共同殺害父親及如何毀屍以圖滅跡之供詞、忽全部推翻、據供稱、我對於上訴不服第一審判決</p>
<p>理由有三</p>
<p>（一）我父此次　害、係我弟弟一人所為、我幷不知情、當時捕房趣指我亦屬同謀、（二）年齡問題、（三）母觀實屬寃枉、緣父親生前、對於我母子待遇極劣、痛苦殊深、去年十二月五號夜九時許欽祥按照向例先睡、我終十一時亦臥、至夜半忽聞弟行走聲、因而驚醒、見弟、詢其何事、據云父親被其弄死、以電綫觸於頭部、霎時即死、我即往視、見父屍躺在床上、頭面以被朦住、我以事已如此、深思欲將屍體運出埋葬、但因手中無錢、不能辦事、乃在抽屜中拾得父親之現款及存摺、於翌晨偕弟往法國公園商議、賞時弟亦表贊同、嗣弟以欲購買物件、我乃將款交給、讓弟先去、我直至下午五時餘貽回家、見弟已回、正在洋台上支解父屍、頭脚已經砍下、正在鋸解一腿、我當詢弟何故如此、答、因尸身太大、須切小後方可裝箱運出、其時下面忽聞敲門聲、我詢誰、答捕房人員、人中大急，乃下樓開門、被捕、查此事實係弟一人所作、因我姊欽珠、平日與我</p>
<p>頗屬相投</p>
<p>而對弟則不合、故當時在家中商議此事、由我與弟二人共同所為、俾欽珠因此可以不報捕房云云、庭上關於周家之房崖建設狀况、詢問頗詳、歷時甚久、繼由西探長拿落夫投訴、此案由周欽珠報告捕房、由彼帶領華探前往調查情形、詰之周欽祥、供認其父係我個人謀死、與兄無關、因我平日性喜研究無綫電工稈、故是日勝買電綫等等、兄幷不注意、當時我先以電綫一根、插入撲落、乘父親熟陲時、置放於有太陽穴、深恐其未死、乃另以檯燈電綫分置於手足、當時父親雖叫喊、其聲極低、迨父死後即以被朦頭、叫兄帮忙、將尸首抬至另一小室內、我抬頭、兄抬脚、嗣聞母親叫喚、我乃至母室、詢我何事、我答父親巳被我弄死、母親聞語大驚、謂你弄死父親與弄死我－樣、我以事已至此、亦不必多語、此時姊亦起身、我乃與見商議</p>
<p>處置尸體　辦法、庭上問、你為何將父弄死、答、因父對待母親極劣、動輒毆打、受苦殊深、最近更烈、且故意與母親為難、母親因患必臟病吃粥、而父不許、定令燒飯、且故意將憲開歌、俾母親受凉、病可加重、諸如此類、不一而足、對待我兄弟、則手段更劣、非但責打隨之、且不許求學、指我等并非彼所生、故不以子母相待等語、二人並同稱其母事先實在不知、係遭寃屈、再提周經氏至案稱、今年五十歲、廿四歲嫁死者、過三年、生長女欽珠、翌年生欽吉、又隔三年生欽祥、故兩子均是親生、所供不外遭夫虐待、兩子不忍坐視、致鬧此荒謬大禍、事先伊實不知情、毀屍時伊在樓上、故亦未知、而言至傷心處、淚如雨下、全庭男女旁聽人、咸為之酸鼻、最後氏稱、此案</p>
<p>冥冥之中　　實為前世刦數、出事前月餘、其家磷近鬼聲啾啾、終夜不輟、余自意將不久人世、不料生此大變、並指兩子生性聰明絕頂、而反遭聰明誤矣、庭上再命傳告訴人　飲象至衆、楷廿六歲、東、訊以弟年歲、　供欽吉二十五歲、飲賺一十二歲、當出事前、伊巴熱　、由飲祥來喚　說、父　已做載奔死、屍巴被用補　捆就、故未見、但離　兄弟說給父親　係兩人共同殺死、股屍亦　二人同　、父親與彼兄弟感情是素來惡劣、中間會一度不令讀書、對其母周經氏則亦稱係被寬、最後再傳證人問居房客許元章與周經氏之姊陳經氏訊問一過、時已鐘鳴七下、庭上以</p>
<p>案已明瞭</p>
<p>本可開始辯論、但被告律師因對今日被告供詞須加以陽卷整理、始可準備六護資料、目請求對兩被告之年歲問題、予以調查、因如按周飲祥鴛十八歲、則去歲出事時尚未滿十八歲、法定年齡興案隨有關係、且上訴人等均有傳統之精神病症、對法醫鑑定報告、未能加以斷定，認為不滿意、應請重行鑑定、庭上核情、當諭關於請求重行鑑定着另行具狀請求候核、並着承辦華探退庭後隨周欽珠至家、搜取兩被告畢業女憑或有關文件、以備查考年齡、本案候改期再訊、被告等分別還押、退庭時已七時有半矣、</p>
<h3>中滙大樓房客　拒絕加租　雙方仍在僵持中</h3>
<p>愛多亞路中滙銀行大樓房客、於本年二月初旬、突接該大樓房東來函謂、一律增加租金一成至五成、但房客以際此生計維艱、再加租金、實不勝負擔、且本市若干大樓加租之唯一理由、係因水汀所用之煤、價格狂漲、而中匯大樓並未開放水汀、房東理由殊欠充分、因召開房客會議、請房來收回成命、但房東未尤、故此事已陷於僵持、三月份房租、迄今房東猶米收受、故房客方面議決、在本星期內將租金提存法院云、</p>

<p>緬甸為南洋各島中之蕞　國耳，　羅南掌，孟加拉　地　牙相錯，而耽耽虎視者，又　俄英諸大國，彼等日伺其旁，雖奉中國之貢賦，惟鞭長莫及，不能隨時赴援，宜何如戰兢惕厲，克自振拔，庶可內聯與國之好，外阻强鄰之謀，乃傳聞緬甸新王嗣位之後，暴虐很戾，漫無法度，是直以國事為兒戲，而祖業有將墜之憂矣。商書曰：「天作孽，猶可違；自作孽，不可　。」孟子有言：「國必自伐而後人伐之。」今緬王初無伐之之人，而願自作其孽，以招人之伐，其禍豈遠也哉。大凡小國之得以自存，全賴內治精密，無隙可乘，方可以禦外侮。昔東周之　，以式微之國，錯處於晋楚兩大之間，牲　玉泉，待於二境，其勢亦可為岌岌矣。然國可弱而卒不可滅者，以子產一番振刷，有以持大體而樹國基也。秦始皇、隋煬帝，以天子之尊，藉混一之統，天下無不仰而企之，畏而敬之，而始皇以焚書坑儒，暴戾致怨，陳陟振臂一麾，舉世紛紛響應，函　之固不可恃，而祖龍之威於是乎不能復振。糃帝藉先人遺緖，多心所肆，盜賊蟲起，而遂亡之。彼之所恃者，豈不厚於緬甸哉，而卒無救於滅亡，知人心之聚散，具係乎國家之興廢者，良非淺也。古云：「民罔常懷，懷於有仁。」善哉言也。</p>

<h3>罪案是疾病</h3>
<p>— 黄嘉音</p>
<p>今日西方文明國的進步的司法界，已經走上了一條合理的新道路了。</p>
<p>在歐美各國，法官，獄吏，精神病學家，心理學專家，犯罪學家，已經結成了一條牢不可破的連鎖了。他們處理罪案的態度，是科學化的，研究的，分析的，而不是推想的，猜測的。</p>
<p>他們把罪案看做一種疾病，一種社會的疾病，一種精神上的疾病，他們便是這罪案的疾病的醫生，他們的目的是在診療，在救治。</p>
<p>所以新的司法對付罪案的手段，是敎育的，訓導的，感化的。譴責的，刑罰的，報復的司法，已經逐漸被時代所淘汰了。</p>
<p>中國在科學方面是比較落後的，可是我們的司法富局，還是應該盡量利用我們所僅有的科學工具，去硏究罪案，去分析罪案，這樣一來，我們希望對於大小的案件，可以得到一種比較公平而合理的判決。</p>

<h3>美國的弒父案</h3>
<p>— 今純</p>
<p>最近上海發生了一件弒父案，曾哄動一時，現在再看美國也有這類事件發生，可見這實在是一個嚴重的社會問題，但在這裏除了說兩聲「世風日下，人心不古」的腐話，來一套「惡貫滿盈，大快人心」的把戲外，似乎應有一種積極的補救辦法才對。</p>
<p>美國有兩個男孩子，會弒殺自己的父親。有一個那時祗十二歲，另一個那時年十五歲，十二歲的孩子見他父親酗醉毆擊他母親，因要救他的母親。於是拔槍將他的父親一記射死。至於那十五歲的孩子呢，他非常愛他的母親和姊姊，他也愛他的父親，但同時却免不了要恨他，因爲他父親戀着另一個女人。有一天禮拜六，他到他父親那裏去，哀求他回家。他父親答應了，說明天是星期日準回來吃飯。孩子聽見這話，高興極了，連跑帶跳的奔回家去。他帮助他的母親和姊姊整理房間，助同她們陳設點綴，帮助她們計劃佈置，預備明天的晚飯。</p>
<p>到了第二天星期日下午，每歇個五分鐘，他就要跑到門口去，向街上張望。每歇個幾分鐘，他的母親就要朝鏡子照照，再向那爐子看看。每歇個幾分鐘，阿姊就要將桌上的蠟燭燃起，稍停，又將它吹滅。</p>
<p>後來，他們曉得，爸爸那天晚上是不回來的了。</p>
<p>母親往牀上一撲，忍不住痛哭，阿姊也在自己房裏吸泣不止。</p>
<p>孩子偷偷的取了他父親的槍，溜了出來，他向家酒店走去。　「他隔着窗子對裏面問道，爸爸，你預備回家嗎？」</p>
<p>父親大笑起來，說　　，我才不回去呢。」</p>
<p>孩子開槍轟擊，一記就將他父親打死了，他一逕回到家裏去，靜候警吏到來，將他捕去。他自己承認弒父罪，但當一位檢察官正要判刑時，忽然有一位天主敎的神父　倫納出來干涉了。</p>
<p>他說　　這孩于之所以犯罪，是由於他愛他的母親。這問題太大了，太複雜了，這問題不是這小小年齡的孩子所能解決的。而驅使他去犯罪的動機，更完全不是這孩子的力量所能控制的。你們不能怪這孩子。」</p>
<p>他於是就舉他所創辦的「兒童城」爲證，兒童城是專以敎養流浪兒與問題兒童爲目的的。他向法院索取這孩子，他保證可以使他成爲一個體面的公民。</p>
<p>孩子的母親聽神父辯護時，不禁感動痛哭，而一班旁聽者，都感動忘形，忽而歡呼，忽而悲啼。裁判官禁止不住衆人煞情流露，他自己也禁不住深爲感動。</p>

<h3>精神變態的檢驗</h3>
<p>— 黄嘉德</p>
<p>據現代心理學家的研究，犯罪與精神變態是有着很密切的關係的，所以一部份罪犯被審判的時候，必須經過一番精神變態的檢騐，使法官的判決能够得到一個合理而公尤的根據。現代精神病學專家在檢騐罪犯的時候，普通是由家庭歷史，個人歷史，患病歷史，身體檢騐，神經檢騐，和精神檢騐等方面入手的。茲將這六方面的檢騐情形略述如下：</p>
<p>（一）家庭歷史—家庭歷史的查考是極端重要的工作。檢騐者須設法查究該犯人的祖先曾吾患過精神上，神經上或身體上的疾病。這種事實可由罪犯的親戚朋友，或監督過他的師長或官吏，或犯人自己而獲得。不過犯人的親戚爲了家族的體面關係，也許會故作欺騙朦蔽之言，同時犯人自己爲了精神變態的關係，也許不能作準確的報吿，這一點是應該特別注意的。關於這一方面，最重要的是查究其父母，祖父母或旁系的親屬是否患過瘋狂症，神經病，酒精中毒症，肺病，花柳病，關節炎或其他身體上的疾病，是否有過麻醉藥的嗜好，或是否有過犯罪或自殺的行爲。這穢事實對於罪犯的身世和環境是極有關係的。</p>
<p>（二）　人歷史—檢查個人歷史須由罪犯未出世的時候開始。在他成胎的時候，他的父母是否患過身體上的疾病；在他出世的時候，他的母親是否受過難產的痛苦。他的幼年生活如何，何時入學讀書，成績如何，曾吾喝過酒或服用過麻醉藥品，曾否患過花柳病。他的性習慣如何，是否患過手淫或有過不正當的性關係。婚後生活是否快樂。（有些事實當然不是輕易可以得到的）檢騐者由這些事實可以知道犯人的精神構造，性格，和生活環境的一般情形。</p>
<p>（三）患病歷史—檢騐者須設法查明犯人所患的疾病是怎樣造成的。他在犯罪以前，身體上或精神上會吾受過重大的刺激或打擊？他的行爲是否反常？他也許息失眠症，胃口欠佳，抑鬱不歡，記憶力减退，也許想自殺或殺人。他也許覺得他不能適應環境。這種事實與犯罪的原因很有關係，所以應該詳細記錄下來。</p>
<p>（四）身體檢騐—專家檢騐犯人的身體時，可以知道他是否憂鬱，快樂，多疑，易怒，好鬥，是否有敵視的態度。他的動作是敏捷的，準確的，有目的的，或遲緩的，壓抑的，無目的的。他的外貌和談話的態度也時常可以顯示他的精神狀態。此外如身體各部的構造，消化系，呼吸系，循環系，腺系，以及生殖泌尿官能的現狀，也須加以注意。犯人是否患糖尿症，肺病，花柳病，淋病，金屬中毒症，陽胃病等嚴重的疾病，也不可不詳細檢查。</p>
<p>（五）神經檢騐關於這一方面，專家所注意的是犯人的神經狀態，眼睛的動作如何，神經系在身體各部分的反應如何，肌肉的動作如何，各部分的皮膚的一般感覺如何，五官的功能如何，體內器官的反應如何，言語和寫字的技能如何，曾吾患過痙孿症等等。</p>
<p>（六）精神檢騐—神檢騐的目的是要查出犯人在意識上是吾有過擾亂，是否有過幻覺或妄念，感覺，判斷力或理解力是否發生錯亂，注意力和記憶力是否减退，思想是否紊亂，情感是否變態，意志力是否受損，因爲這些現象是會直接影響到罪犯的行爲的。這種檢騐必須非常澈底，非常詳盡。如果辦得到的話，罪犯所答的話均須記錄下來，以供參考。檢騐者對於罪犯的敎育程度和人生經騐，必須先作詳細的考慮，然後斷定他的精神狀態。這種檢騐是大有助於案件的合理判決的。</p>
<p>心理</p>
<h3>瘋狂與犯罪</h3>
<p>— 羅道愛</p>
<p>在各種罪犯之中，瘋在者是佔了相當巨大的數目的。瘋在者的犯罪行爲往往不容易和常人的犯罪行爲辨別出來，因爲除了硏究犯罪的根本動機之外，普通外表的行爲是不足爲決定癥在者與常人的標準的。精神錯亂的人在犯罪的行爲上，有時會表現相當的技巧和智慧，看起來好像是處心積慮的有計劃的行動，因此被人當做是精神健全的罪犯。他也許會故弄玄虛，設法掩蔽他的犯罪行爲，以企規避責任及刑罰。可是這是他保存自己的本能行爲，我們不該以此爲理由，以證明他的精神是絕對健全的。</p>
<p>癲癎症是病態犯罪行爲最重要的一個原因。根據監獄醫生檢查的結果，在患精神病的罪犯之中，患癲癎症者佔大多數。有些患癲癎者在犯罪的時候，看來是十分有意識的，可是事實上他的意識幾乎完全失掉；當他恢復平常的精神狀態時，他完全記不起他所做過的行爲。除了癲癎症之外，罪犯所患的最普通的精神病是早發性痴呆，局部麻痺症，憂鬱性瘋在症，歇斯得里性瘋在症，產後瘋在症，老衰神經錯亂症，腦部花柳病，麻醉藥神經錯亂症，白痴等。</p>
<p>瘋在者的犯罪行爲多數是以人爲對象的。據專家的調查，患瘋狂的罪犯當中犯殺人罪者比平常的罪犯多了三倍，犯强姦鷄姦和亂倫之罪者比平常的罪犯多了一倍至一倍半。美國印第安那州州立監獄當局曾把二千二百六十五個犯人的犯罪行爲統計如下：</p>
<p>犯殺人罪者…百分之五·三</p>
<p>犯强姦，鷄姦和亂倫罪者…百分之六·一</p>
<p>犯殺人與强姦罪者…百分之十四·六</p>
<p>犯大小偷竊罪者…百分之五十三·二</p>
<p>在患瘋在症的犯人當中：</p>
<p>犯殺人罪者…百分之十六·六</p>
<p>犯强姦，鷄姦，亂倫罪者…百分之九·八</p>
<p>犯殺人與强姦罪者…百分之三〇·五</p>
<p>犯大小偷竊罪者…百分之三十七·七</p>
<p>可見患瘋狂症的罪犯多數是以人爲對象的。這一點使我們知道患瘋在症的罪犯必須隔離的監禁起來。</p>
<h3>向瘧蚊世界進攻M.Chin.172</h3>
<p>瘧蚊世界並小說家所幻構，蓋確實存在於人類之間，且其勢力晨常廣大，每年有三百五十尤人之生命被其犧牲，而其所加於工商業上之損失尤屬不　，故世辦各國人士感共起而圖撲此害物也。</p>
<p>瘧蚊常在墨暗中時空行其恐怖工作，而其威力則存於一種肉眼所不能見之母質中，然其所以能猖狂無忌者，一部份亦由於一般人之缺乏知識。</p>
<p>瘧蚊之秘密雖於十九世紀時為英人羅斯所發現，然其惡勢力則迄今無能鐘除之者。瘧蚊之為物，殘暴成性，無論富貴貧賤，士農工商，男女老幼，或信耶敎，或奉回敎，或為佛敎徒，或為婆　門敎徒，一入其手，鮮能倖免。且瘧蚊散段於世界各地，到處理　處，彼自身先梁瘧疾，人體被其　咬，亦被傳染。</p>
<p>根據報告，每年出瘧疾者達八尤尤人，足證瘧蚊實為人類最大公敵之一。今幸國際聯盟會協助全世界人士撲滅蚊，其法卽使大眾週知奎寗治療　疾之功效。國聯　疾委員會，主張於熱症流行之時期內，每日服奎寗六喱，以資預防，而於感染瘧疾後，每日服奎寗十五喱至二十喱，連服五六至七天，瘧疾委員會一九三八年報告幫第一百二十四頁特別提出一點，卽　奎寗一物安全無害，常人均能施用，毋須醫師盬督施用，而綜合性之藥濟則非醫師盬督施用不可。</p>
<p>施用上述之方法後，瘧蚊之為害遂受限制。茍無奎寗一項項治瘧聖藥，則人類將受瘧蚊之任意蹂躪而束手待斃，可斷言也。</p>
<h3>耶穌和失業者　（一）</h3>
<p>嘗聽人說，耶穌的敎訓，已不合時宜，不能應用到這個時代的環竟。耶穌活在一種節　的鄕柯文化之中，那時縱或有有什麼社會問題。也不越出鄕村或小市鎮的範團。設使問題得不着全部的解決，有隣舍的相互幫助以處理之。但是今日呢，情形大不相同，我們的社會問題是全國的，其中有些助成了世界問題。因為昔時的手工業，已被機器工業，和大量生產代替了去，此外，還有其他的種種變遷。雖然如此。歸根結蒂的說起來，現代社會問題，與耶穌所知加利利社會問題，只是大小的差別，性質卻無兩樣。說穿了還不是些老問題。我們看馬太廿章一至十六節的比喩，便知耶穌和門徒活在那簡陋社會裏，早已熟悉失業問題。在這比喩裏，耶穌不曾健議當如何處理失業問題，他心中所想念的不在此，他是借這失業問題，來詮釋其他較遠大的事。他在比喩中，說到上蒂的公正，這無疑的是要世人彼此以公正相待。他于無意之中，把自己對失業所抱的感想，表示出來。只是他主要的意思，不在看此問題，為經濟問題，乃在看為人道問題。我們呢，與他的看法不同，我們把牠看作經濟問題。於是我們的計劃，乙是用茲善來解次。耶穌把人道的目的，列為第一，第濟問題，須　到人道的需要。若是耶穌生在今日，我想他的觀念一定是：人不當去適應經濟制度，而經濟制度卻當過應人。道樣說來，失業問題，在耶穌看，當然第一是個人道問題。凡知道失業若況的人，莫不抱此觀念。各國發生失業恐慌時，民眾墜落的種種事實隨在皆是。很好的人，因為自己的家具，一件一件送進當舖，沉溺到失望之　了；失業者，為了賦閒過久，變得不能工作了；他們的心被妻兒的　餓刺激碎了。於是他們心中起了一種極大的忿怒，反對現行的社會制度。我們若是親歷其境，便自然而然的覺着自己，好像是生存在一個瘋人的世界。人民是國家的元氣現行社會制度，竟坐視這亢氣消沉下去這是亟應加以改良的。我不是經濟學家，這種興衰循環圈。可否玻除，我不知道。不過，我自己認為，這樣的事，是可以免掉的。人有這樣的智慧，應該有如此社會眼光，至少也得把這些反動的緊張情形減輕。如用失業保險法等以預防之。護持一國元氣——人民的大業，不應該私人或半私人的慈善工作隨便去做，也不應讓自己無過錯而失業者，去認受私人或公家施捨的屆辱。（待績）如欲詳細研究請的郵箱一二二七號</p>

<p>— 海星</p>
<p>下月返國轉往內地</p>
<p>我國名學者林語堂氏，將於下月中旬由美返國，預定先到香港，然後轉往內地，彼所主辦之「宇宙風」編輯人林憾盧，將由滬赴港迎接，香港一部分文化人，亦擬準備歡迎。聞林語堂在美向僑胞演講時，對我國之倫常哲學，大為宣揚，林氏云：「華僑在外，每見外國物質文明之發達，為我國所望塵不及，最容易發生自卑心理，殊不知東方文明，固有非西人所可及而為彼等所敬服者，則中國倫常之道是也，中國數千年來，所研究最精而供獻最大者，莫過於倫常哲學，淺而言之，即是做人之道，此種道理，我國人認識既深，實行尤力，觀於我華僑在外，常以誠實美德，見稱於世，且不肯違犯地方法律，故西人有謂「紐約華僑雖多，但不破費警察一文錢」之語，某西人又謂「中國人由上至下，均為斯文君子」，由此觀之，西人所認識我國者，則在此種做人之道，華僑在外國與西人交處，能盡量發揮此種美德，無怪西人悅服，而僑胞為我國文化宣傳之功，莫大於此也」。</p>
<h3>金素琴將返滬</h3>
<p>金素琴到香港去了半個多月，本來預定是十二日在利舞台上演的，現在已經作罷，這個消息，由素琴的親筆信證實，她的原信，有以下的幾段：香港利舞台第一批角色登台已有　多天，賣座不佳，預算要虧本港幣六七千元左右，况且班底不　　，許多劇本均不能上演，如果到上海來加聘，那又是時間相　濟所不許，香港平劇觀衆，僅限於一般上海人，以及少數的　東人（好奇的和對於戲劇有興趣的，或是在上海已經住了很久的廣東人，）有以上的二個大原因，所以我對於在香港登臺成績的預測，　怕不能達到理想上的圓滿，前車可鑒，更使我　外的沒有勇氣……。</p>
<p>在香港既不登台，稍住幾天，就要回上海，現在我住在跑馬地（英文名字是Happy　Valley），照英文字直譯，是「快活谷」，但是我並不覺得快活呢。</p>

<p>在事業上，好萊塢給我極可驚的滿足；在性格上，她又使我增加了「勇氣」和「忍耐心」</p>

<p>Resolutions of the Ninth Session</p>
<p>Chongqing: The main points of the resolutions from the ninth meeting are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The main points of the resolutions regarding the education report are as follows: (1) The number of students studying abroad, regardless of whether they are funded by the British Boxer Indemnity Scholarship, the Sino-American Boxer Indemnity Scholarship, or the Gengzi Indemnity, should not be increased. This is because the cost of studying abroad is much higher than that of domestic students. At this time of economic difficulty, priority should be given to strengthening domestic schools at all levels and expanding the number of students. The existing research institutes in various universities have also been restored, so increasing the number of students studying abroad can be slowed down. (2) Vocational and technical schools aim to train middle- and lower-level technicians and skilled workers, which meets the needs of resisting the war and building the nation. These schools should be gradually increased, and universities that already have agricultural and engineering colleges should establish vocational and technical departments to expand training. (3) It is hoped that the Women's Normal College, approved by the Fourth Session, can be established in the autumn of this year, and it is hoped that the location can take into account the needs of the environment. (4) Attention should be paid to improving the general situation of teachers' service groups and national high schools. (5) Improving the salaries of primary school teachers still requires practical implementation. Educational administrative authorities in each province and city should be urged to handle this matter seriously. (6) Due to the current high cost of living, it is difficult for middle-class families to afford their children's education. Schools at all levels should be notified to pay attention to reducing the economic burden on students as much as possible, such as not requiring overly formal or uniform uniforms. (7) Currently, schools in general do not pay much attention to the physical health of students, or only focus on competitions in academics and other extracurricular activities, without considering the students' ability to bear the burden, or providing meager meals with insufficient nutrition, and inadequate medical facilities. This has a great impact on the future of the nation and should be given serious attention and improved. (8) For overseas Chinese children returning to China to study, in order to facilitate their familiarity with the national situation, it is advisable to have them enroll in existing schools. If they have language difficulties, temporary remedial classes can be established. (9) Vocational schools should pay attention to establishing more night schools and other remedial classes to provide opportunities for workers to study. (10) There are a large number of disabled soldiers. The First Session of this council had a resolution on providing vocational education for disabled soldiers, which should be given attention and actively promoted. (11) Some high schools have independently changed curriculum standards, which has a great impact on the future of students and also damages the dignity of educational laws and regulations. The government should pay attention to correcting this. (2) The proposal by Councilor Zhang Shenfu and 21 others, to protect academic freedom in order to develop scholarship and promote social progress, was resolved as follows: The progress of the nation and society depends on the development of scholarship and culture, and the development of scholarship and culture depends on the emergence of new and different ideas, and the emergence of new and different ideas depends on freedom of thought and freedom of speech. Therefore, modern progressive countries rarely fail to value freedom of thought and freedom of speech. It is proposed that the government issue a notice to the whole country to protect freedom of speech and academic research under the supreme principles of the Three Principles of the People and the Outline for Resistance and Nation-Building. (3) The proposal by Councilor Jiang Hengyuan and 24 others, that the price of textbooks has increased sharply and sources are scarce, urgently requiring a rescue plan, was resolved to be amended and passed. (4) The proposal by Councilor Ou Yuanhuai and 22 others, to establish a Southwestern Vocational and Technical School to facilitate construction, was resolved to be passed. (5) The proposal by Councilor Lufei Bohong and 20 others, to improve national language education, was resolved to be sent to the government for reference. (6) The proposal by Councilor Liu Hengjing and 22 others, to request the government to increase the salaries of primary and secondary school teachers in order to maintain the education cause, was resolved to be passed and sent to the government for practical handling. (Temporary Motions) (1) The temporary motion by Councilor Qin Wangshan and 45 others, to request the government to formulate preferential treatment for overseas Chinese who have worked hard to save the country and have been forced to return, and to have the government designate a special agency to handle overseas Chinese affairs, to quickly investigate and register overseas Chinese who have been forced to return due to patriotic work, and to employ them according to their talents and arrange for them separately, and to give appropriate titles as honorary awards to those who have a considerable status in the overseas Chinese community and do not need government support, was resolved to be passed. (2) The temporary motion by Councilor Li Hongwen and 45 others, to propose that the central government quickly allocate large sums of money to provide disaster relief to the people of Shanxi Province to facilitate the war effort, was resolved to be passed. (3) The temporary motion by Councilor Huang Jianzhong and 43 others, that the disaster situation in Hubei is severe, and proposing that the government quickly allocate large sums of money for disaster relief, was resolved to be passed. (4) The temporary motion by Councilor Luo Lixue and 48 others, requesting the government to quickly allocate large sums of money to provide disaster relief to the people of Lanzhou, was resolved to be passed.

<p>Speaker Chiang's Closing Remarks</p>
<p>Chongqing: At the closing ceremony of the Fifth Session of the National Political Council, Speaker Chiang delivered his closing remarks. The main points are as follows: Speaker Chiang first expressed his satisfaction with this session, saying that this session was particularly spirited, and that all the proposals were more practical and appropriate than previous sessions, which was enough to inspire the military and civilians of the whole country. The council is a collection of talented and virtuous people from all over the country. The more the session is held, the more prosperous and progressive it becomes, just like our army is becoming stronger and stronger as it fights. The council's review reports and proposals are all practical and feasible, and the government will definitely fully accept them and implement them solemnly. He hoped that everyone would supervise and that the people would work together to implement them. He then described the contributions of the National Political Council over the past two years, the greatest of which are two: (1) Realizing sincere unity. Since the establishment of this council, the whole country, from top to bottom, has been able to unite sincerely and truly achieve concentrated will, unified action, sharing life and death, and sharing weal and woe. Due to the establishment of this council, the will of the government and the people has been closely connected, and the virtuous and outstanding talents of the whole country have been loyal and sincere, and have fought together. (2) Supporting the national policy of resistance. The council has made solemn expressions of support for the major plan of resistance to the war at each of its meetings. Our established national policy of resistance over the past two years has been consistently implemented and has not wavered. Only a very small number of people who could not persevere have abandoned themselves and left. (3) Establishing a model of civil governance. The council has completely eliminated the malpractices of past parliaments over the past two years. Everything is open and honest, and there is absolutely no acting on impulse. The biggest bad habit of Chinese scholar-officials from the Han and Tang dynasties to the Song and Ming dynasties was to indulge in their own impulses and sacrifice national interests. Our current situation is completely different. Now, as long as we mention the nation, the ethnicity, and the war of resistance, all personal opinions can be completely sacrificed. This point alone proves that we can become a modern country and hold endless hope for the future of the country.</p>
<p>Finally, Speaker Chiang especially pointed out the three major points that this session focused on, which are (1) Punishing the Japanese puppets, (2) Developing the economy, and (3) Implementing constitutional government. He gave a comprehensive account of each section and explained his personal opinions and expectations. (1) Punishing the Japanese puppets: The unanimous telegram passed on the first day of the session expressed the solemn public opinion of our entire nation. Several words in the telegram exposed the deception and conspiracy of the Japanese puppet organization, which is of great significance to the war of resistance. Looking at past history, we are not afraid of national weakness, but we are afraid of not distinguishing between right and wrong. The fall of dynasties in the past was not only due to scholar-officials valuing impulse and losing integrity, but also because the general society was confused about right and wrong, and did not distinguish between black and white. As a result, people were numb and unconsciously fell into ruin. When I read the history of the past and saw the Jin soldiers crossing the river, saying that there was no one in the Southern Dynasty, I felt that this sentence was the most alarming. It was not that there was no one in the Southern Dynasty, but that the righteous spirit had declined and justice had been lost. Therefore, people were not considered people, and the enemy dared to invade. Therefore, the most important thing is to promote the national righteousness and publicize national justice, to clarify the meaning of the Spring and Autumn Annals, and to strictly distinguish between Xia and Yi. Now, the puppet organization regards the destruction of the country as a peaceful delusion, reversing black and white and shaking people's hearts. Therefore, the greatest contribution of this council is to distinguish between right and wrong. As long as the righteous spirit exists and justice is upheld, no enemy will ever be able to destroy China. This time, the council's expression is enough to deter the enemy in spirit and make the treacherous lose their souls. The greatness of the spiritual power of the Chinese people now will never be recognized by the Japanese warlords. The Japanese only know how to study the history of the late Ming Dynasty, but they do not know the history of the founding of the Republic of China at all. They do not know how the Qing Dynasty was overthrown, how the Republic of China was established, and even more so, they do not think about the spirit of our Chinese era and the power of the Three Principles of the People. Now, they are sending Abe to be a disguised Korean Governor-General. Such aggression and insult will inevitably stimulate our extraordinarily strong national consciousness. The more rampant and cunning the Japanese warlords are, the closer the future of our revolutionary victory is. (2) Developing the economy: The colleagues of this council are most concerned about the economy during the war of resistance. Whether it is reviewing reports or discussing proposals, they are particularly fresh about the economic aspects, which is very gratifying. But I have a few opinions that I want to say in passing, that is, China's economy cannot be viewed in the same way as other countries. The wartime economy is originally more and more difficult the longer it lasts. But now that China's war of resistance has been going on for nearly three years, it is not easy for us to be able to support it until now without a foundation. It is also because we have a vast land, abundant resources, and a large population. As long as the people's life of food, clothing, and housing is properly regulated and controlled, and production is developed in a proper manner, there will be no problems. Therefore, I am indeed very optimistic about the future of the wartime economy. Of course, the points that everyone is worried about are worthy of constant vigilance. But as long as we follow our established plan and the proposals of the conference, and the government and the people work together, I can say that not only can we support it, but even if the situation becomes more difficult, we will definitely be able to regenerate ourselves. The key now is that personnel have not yet been exhausted. In the future, we must follow the actual situation and do it in a practical way. Here, I want to especially remind everyone and the general public to be able to endure pain and hardship in particular. We must expect that there will be ten or twenty times more difficult days in the future, and we must be determined to endure hardship to shoulder this difficulty and overcome this difficulty. We must work hard to produce, we must conserve consumption, and we must also improve all economic methods. The government must be more responsible, and the people must be more diligent and persistent. We must take the partial peace and laziness after the Southern Song Dynasty as a warning. We must especially talk about integrity and responsibility, and do not let the sacrifices of the soldiers and the suffering of the compatriots be turned into nothing. Therefore, corruption must be punished and negligence must be abandoned. In short, being able to endure pain and hardship will surely achieve the goal of winning the war of resistance.</p>
<p>(3) Implementing constitutional government: At this meeting, everyone enthusiastically discussed constitutional government. Although a satisfactory conclusion has not yet been reached due to time constraints, our colleagues can still contribute their opinions after the meeting. The council will send the draft of the Constitutional Government Preparation Committee and everyone's opinions to the government, awaiting the final decision of the National Assembly. My personal opinion is that the matter of constitution-making must be completely planned for the long-term interests of the country, and we must learn from the painful lessons and experiences of the past, so as to lay a good foundation for the future implementation of the constitution and truly create welfare for the people. Therefore, we must not only pay attention to the history and national conditions of the past, and pay attention to the current facts and environment, but also take into account the future after the constitution is promulgated and implemented. We must know that China's current task is to achieve national independence, freedom, and equality, and the implementation of this task requires ten or twenty years of labor. Especially important, I believe that the spirit of the Five-Power Constitution must not be violated. Since we want to build China into a Republic of the Three Principles of the People, there cannot be clauses in the constitution that violate the Five-Power Constitution. If we believe that there are things that cannot be done for a while, but should be gradually enriched and gradually improved, there is of course a temporary expedient power, but it must not be stipulated within the constitution. I believe that our constitutional draft must be flexible and require that every article be practical. Finally, Speaker Chiang summarized the entire article and expressed his gratitude for the efforts of all councilors. He also especially hoped that everyone would attach importance to practice and not deviate from reality, because saving the country is a difficult and arduous task. Not only are we physically suffering, but our hearts are also suffering. Our country has not yet achieved an independent and equal position, the enemy has not yet been driven out, the nation has not yet been built, the people are still in pain, and the country is still suffering humiliation. We must not be careless, we must not forget the realistic pain of the country, and we must be down-to-earth in everything, endure hardship and hard work, and unite to do our utmost sincerity and effort. We must think about what kind of phenomenon the Japanese are trying to create by delusionally insulting us, breaking us up, and slackening us. Therefore, all colleagues must lead the people and save the country with a spirit of seeking truth from facts. Recalling the experience of weathering the storm together and helping each other in times of adversity over the past two years, I especially hope that all colleagues will do their best for the country, be candid friends to each other, and work together to achieve our sacred mission.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Expansion of the European War and the Far East</h3>
<p>The three Scandinavian countries, Sweden, Norway, and Finland, have always been known for their love of freedom. Their economies and cultures are highly developed, but because they are small and weak, they have always avoided all kinds of European disputes, trying to stay out of them, as was the case until the recent Soviet-Finnish War. This European war suddenly turned from a stalemate to an expansion, and the first to bear the brunt were Denmark and Norway. Denmark is located across the sea from the Scandinavian Peninsula, and it and Norway have now become important battlefields in the European war, which is truly lamentable and deserving of sympathy. This trend of expansion of the European war, whether from the perspective of the welfare of the whole world or from the perspective of the development of human history, is a great misfortune. However, from the perspective of the belligerent countries themselves, rather than a long stalemate, becoming a chronic disease, and ultimately inevitably using national fortune as a single bet, it is better to quickly seek a decisive battle of the main forces and determine the outcome as soon as possible. If the result of this expansion of the war accelerates the collapse of countries that aggressively wage war, and lays a fair and lasting true peace as soon as possible, then even if Denmark and Norway are sacrificed on the altar this time, they will still be beneficial to the welfare of the world and human civilization.</p>
<p>At present, the European war has reached its second stage, and it is still difficult to make a sudden judgment on how its future will gradually develop, but the kind of behavior that disregards international law and wantonly bullies the weak will inevitably arouse the condemnation and anger of the whole world, and will eventually be subject to the final sanction of fairness and justice. We firmly believe that the realization of the final sanction is only a matter of time; and from today to the day of realization, although it is difficult to predict the distance of time, the existence of phenomena awaiting sanction in the Far East has now been three years. We firmly believe that the final sanctions that the world is brewing and promoting in tangible and intangible ways will inevitably confirm the double importance of realizing the final sanctions due to the needs of both Northern Europe and the Far East.</p>
<p>The expansion of the European war is probably seen by the Japanese warlords as a development worthy of joy. Because Britain's strength is even more constrained by the Northern European battle situation, its position in the Far East will naturally be diminished; Japan, on the other hand, will be able to increase its international weight as a result. In fact, how much influence can be gained and lost, and the impact on the final result, be gained? Schadenfreude is just useless self-consolation. Let us consider: if Japan had not been trapped in the quagmire of the war of resistance by China for more than thirty months, then Japan's harvest in this European war would have long surpassed that of five years ago. If the Soviet-Finnish War had not ended in a truce a month ago, then now would be a good time for Japan to extort from all the belligerent countries. If so, then the Far East would be dominated by Japan, and Japan's international weight would almost be able to compete with the United States. But the reality is not so. Now, on the one hand, Japan is trapped in the increasingly deep invasion of China, unable to get rid of it, not only losing the good opportunity to seize special economic and political interests, but also because of its declining strength and weakening national power, it is no longer as worthy of attention as it was in the previous European war; on the other hand, although Britain and France are focusing all their efforts on dealing with the European situation and have no time to take care of the Far East, there are still the Soviet Union and the United States outside the European war, which will always be the main forces for stabilizing the Far East together with China in the war of resistance. Therefore, although the European war has spread outwards, Japan's importance in the international arena, although relatively increased compared to Britain and France, is still not enough to save Japan's decline, that is, it cannot reap the benefits of the fisherman.</p>
<p>Regarding China's national policy of resistance, the authorities have repeatedly stated that they will not be affected by any international changes; and the expansion of the European war has made China's government and people feel that they are not alone, and has further stimulated their determination to resist aggression. Not only that, but China's government and people will inevitably strengthen their feeling that China's war of resistance has now significantly had an international significance; in other words, after the expansion of the European war, China is not only sharing important responsibilities for the welfare of the world and human civilization through the war of resistance, but will also provide important contributions through the war of resistance. On the other hand, the seriousness of the European situation and the expansion of the European war have no adverse impact on China's war of resistance. For example, the military supplies that China obtains from Britain and France have always been very, very small, almost equal to zero; moreover, China already has a large amount of storage, and the self-manufacturing and self-sufficiency plan has also been implemented step by step, making rapid progress and achieving outstanding achievements; the international routes in the northwest and southwest have not been blocked. As for the economic situation, the demand of the belligerent countries for China's various native products and military raw materials will tend to be more eager, which is indirectly increasing China's material strength in the war of resistance.</p>
<p>The attitudes of the United States and the Soviet Union towards the new stage of the European war are of course related to the current situation in the Far East. But from the current situation, the United States and the Soviet Union not only show no signs of being dragged into the whirlpool of war, but also understand that the national policies of the two countries are to plan to avoid being dragged into the whirlpool. The US national policy has always been calm and firm, and it is extremely concerned about the European situation and deeply hates aggressive countries; its aversion to war, whether it is the government, the people, or the parties in and out of power, has been consistent until now; unless special events occur, this emotion will not change. As for the Soviet Union, its situation is far more complex than that of the United States, and the expansion of the war this time happened to occur in Scandinavia and the entrance to the Baltic Sea, which are closely related to the Soviet Union's own interests. But the Soviet Union has its own unique position and traditional national policy and will not do the foolish thing of pulling chestnuts out of the fire. Although the Soviet Union's attitude is currently more inclined towards Germany and has repeatedly criticized Britain and France, the Soviet Union's assistance to Germany has a certain limit and has not taken hostile actions against Britain and France. The British government's attitude towards the Soviet Union has recently become much more relaxed than it was a month ago, so as long as the Northern European war does not spread to the Soviet border, the Soviet Union is unlikely to participate in the war. Therefore, under the phenomenon of the expansion of the European war, all the factors related to the Far Eastern situation show that there is no change at all; and the way to stabilize the Far East and create the Far East is still for China to move towards the victory of the war of resistance!</p>

<h3>Japanese Spokesperson Claims the Pearl River Will Be Opened</h3>
<p>Tokyo: A Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson, while meeting with reporters today, stated that the Pearl River will be reopened in the near future. However, the term "reopened" is not appropriate, as the river has already been reopened for navigation and trade, except for certain restrictions. Therefore, "removing these restrictions" is the more appropriate term. He hopes that this will be announced soon. Local Japanese authorities are also taking steps to accelerate the reopening of the Yangtze River. (Reuters, 10th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Fiscal Budget Heavily Criticized - Government Plans to Develop Industry and Agriculture</h3>
<p>Tokyo: After the Japanese House of Representatives passed the massive fiscal budget for this year, it has been heavily criticized by various parties. In light of this, the government plans to compile a separate material budget to make up for its shortcomings. In essence, the government plans to massively develop domestic industrial and agricultural production, striving to enable Japan and its East Asian partners to achieve self-sufficiency. However, this material budget has not yet been submitted to the Diet, as the authorities believe that publishing the export indices of industry and agriculture for this year would be tantamount to exposing the country's strength and future plans to enemy countries and the entire world. Therefore, all news regarding production plans are treated as military secrets. However, according to reports in various local newspapers, this material budget is unlikely to be established before May of this year. At this time, it is necessary to thoroughly revise the plan formulated in 1939 and then use it to create the entire procedure as part of a large-scale production development plan. According to the Miyako Shimbun, the 1939 material mobilization plan originally included coal, iron, light metals, rubber juice, wool, and other items. Now, it is planned to expand the scope to include other major items such as rice, wheat, various major foods, synthetic gasoline, rubber, and specialized machinery and tools. When implementing the new plan, the government will naturally tighten controls. The coal production plan and several other special programs that have already been approved by the House of Representatives will also be included in the new plan to complement the price adjustment policy. As for the Price Adjustment Committee, it is being organized and will determine appropriate prices for various daily necessities. At the same time, a plan will also be established to include North China, Inner Mongolia, and Manchukuo, so as to provide appropriate coordination and adjustment to the economic development plans of each region.

<h3>Norwegian Prime Minister Declares Oath to Fight for Independence and Freedom - German Troops Landing and Advancing Northward Occupy Hamar - Skagerrak Strait Blocked</h3>
<p>Paris: According to Finnish radio, Norwegian Prime Minister Nygaardsvold announced today at a meeting of the Norwegian Parliament held in Elverum that Norway intends to continue fighting for its integrity and independence. The entire assembly unanimously approved this declaration. (Reuters, 10th dispatch)</p>
<p>Stockholm: News from here last night reported that Norwegian troops had defended the defensive line from Oslo to Hamar. Norway is confident that it has resisted the German advance until national mobilization is completed. (Associated Press, 10th dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to authoritative sources in the Nazi Party, German troops have occupied Hamar today. This location is north of Oslo, where the Norwegian government was based after retreating from the capital. (Associated Press, 10th dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German High Command recently stated that bases of military importance in Norway are now in German hands. German troops have firmly occupied Oslo, Trondheim, Bergen, Narvik, Stavanger, and Kristiansand. The serious resistance encountered by German troops in Oslo and Kristiansand has been crushed. Coastal batteries are now preparing to repel any enemy attacks. (Reuters, 10th dispatch)</p>
<p>Stockholm: It is reported that British aircraft were operating yesterday over Moss on the east bank of the Oslofjord. Norwegian troops were still resisting German forces in several locations last night, but the area near Oslo was quite calm. It is reported that the Germans have laid mines from Lillesand on the southern tip of Norway to Skagen, so the Skagerrak Strait has been blocked. According to news from Gothenburg, German minelaying vessels worked tirelessly all day in the Skagerrak Bay. (Reuters, 10th dispatch)</p>
<p>Stockholm: It is rumored that the Oscarsborg Fortress at the entrance to the Oslofjord fought all day yesterday. Last night, it was still bombarding the invading German forces. According to the Norwegian Navy, German aircraft bombed Oslo's East Railway Station three times, but all missed their targets. Several people were injured when Kjeller Airfield outside Oslo was attacked. (Reuters, 10th dispatch)</p>
<p>London: Norwegian sources here recently stated that only a few dozen German troops landed in Norwegian ports. Their main force has been unable to continue arriving due to the intervention of British and French warships. Even among those who have landed, a portion of them came from Murmansk in the Soviet Union. Alternatively, several German transport ships carrying troops arrived in Norwegian territorial waters before the British and French fleets laid mines, preparing to land at predetermined locations. In short, there is no doubt that this German action was meticulously prepared before the British and French decided to lay mines. As for Norway's strength, the northern part currently has a division of the army stationed there, totaling 25,000 officers and men, while Trondheim Port in the central part has a division of 12,000 officers and men, both equipped with new weapons. The country has no fewer than 200,000 troops. In addition, the seventh joint meeting of the Supreme Defence Committee of Great Britain and France has decided to provide assistance. It is believed that it will be able to cope with the current situation with ease. (Havas, 9th dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin: The official German radio station issued a message last night stating that Denmark, with the exception of a very small portion, has been completely occupied by German troops. According to the German communiqué, German troops implemented a military operation yesterday in accordance with the predetermined plan, occupying Denmark and the Norwegian coast. When German troops entered Denmark and landed in the country, no unexpected incidents occurred. As for the Norwegian coast, the only resistance worth mentioning was seen in Oslo. However, in the afternoon, German troops crushed the resistance and occupied Oslo. (Reuters, 10th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Under German Military Control, a Norwegian "New Government" Appears - Danish Government Also Forced to Reorganize</h3>
<p>Berlin: German Radio reports that General Kaupisch, the German Commander-in-Chief in Denmark, broadcast to the Danish people today, stating that German troops will pay attention to preventing even one Englishman from appearing in Norway and Denmark. Churchill, the greatest troublemaker of this century, is preparing to strike the Danish and Norwegian coasts. The Danish and Norwegian governments are neither willing nor able to effectively resist British aggression. The German High Command is now in contact with the Danish government to establish an agreement to maintain the freedom of the Danish people and the future independence of Denmark. General Falkenhorst, the German Commander-in-Chief in Norway, also broadcast the same remarks to the Norwegian people. (Reuters, 9th dispatch)</p>

<p>Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Quisling, Minister of Defense Wustrau, Minister of Social Affairs Riidnter, Minister of Justice Lie, Minister of Labor Stangke.</p>
<p>Note: "New Prime Minister" Quisling is the founder of the Norwegian Nationalist Party. During the European War, Quisling served as a secretary in Nansen's expedition team. In 1932, Quisling served as the Norwegian Minister of Defense, but later resigned due to political disagreements. (Haitong, 10th dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to a dispatch from Oslo, the so-called Norwegian "new government" was established last night. Using the Oslo radio station controlled by the Germans, a message to the Norwegian people was broadcast, with Quisling speaking as the leader of the new government, accusing Britain of laying mines in Norwegian territorial waters, thereby destroying Norwegian neutrality. He also said that the Norwegian government has resigned, and is now replaced by a national coalition government to protect Norwegian interests, hoping that the people will work together to escape the current crisis. (Reuters, 10th dispatch)</p>
<p>Copenhagen: Denmark established a coalition government last night, with three representatives each from the opposition Conservative Party and the Farmers' Party participating in the new government. Prime Minister Stauning declared to Parliament last night that the new cabinet members have the same powers as other cabinet members, but are cabinet members without portfolio. Stauning also briefly described the current situation, saying that he firmly believes that the government's decision has enabled the people of Denmark to avoid the scourge of war. He called on all national troops to cooperate sincerely. (Haitong, 10th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Rumor That Norwegian Government is Preparing to Negotiate with Germany</h3>
<p>London: According to Stockholm radio, the Norwegian Parliament today passed a resolution to send four representatives to negotiate a "peace with honor" with the German authorities. Before the Parliament meeting, the Norwegian Ministry of Defense held a meeting to decide on the selection of four representatives. After accepting the proposal to send representatives, Norwegian Speaker of the Upper House Hambro adjourned the parliament temporarily. In this special meeting, Speaker Hambro only gave a brief speech, ending with "God save our country." (Associated Press, 10th dispatch)</p>

<p>London: Neither the Norwegian embassy nor the British Foreign Office have received confirmed information regarding Norway's agreement to negotiate with Germany. A British spokesman said that all news coming from sources under German control is unreliable. As long as Oslo is in German hands, news coming from the so-called Norwegian side is as unreliable as that coming from the Berlin propaganda department. (Reuters, 10th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Peaceful Country Actually Trampled - The Painful Words of the Danish Prime Minister</h3>
<p>London: According to a radio broadcast from Copenhagen, Danish Prime Minister Thorvald Stauning stated in Parliament last night that Denmark has always regarded not interfering in major foreign affairs as its policy, but he was very worried when he suddenly received the news at night that German troops had crossed the Danish-German border. With German bombers circling over the skies of Copenhagen, the Danish government had no choice but to accept the demand to allow German troops to enter Denmark. Germany confirmed that it had no intention of destroying Denmark's independence and territorial integrity. The Danish government's goal for the country and the people is to preserve them from the ravages of war. It is very sad that good Danish men lost their lives today. Our only wish is for peace. Negotiations to transform the government based on broad foundations are currently underway. (Reuters, 10th dispatch)</p>
<p>Malmö, Sweden: Malmö is separated from Copenhagen by water, but very little news comes from Copenhagen. It is only known that when the Germans attacked Copenhagen last night, the entire city was filled with an atmosphere of grief and sorrow. Three Danish soldiers were shot and killed by German troops in the city. The invading German troops included artillery units, infantry units, marine units, and air units. A unit of 150 Danish soldiers has crossed into Swedish territory. According to the captain, they hope to join the Swedish army. Most residents of Copenhagen did not know about the situation in their own country until they read the leaflets distributed by German aircraft. Before the outbreak of the European War, Copenhagen was a center for Nazi spies. Nazi party members are everywhere. It is reported that secret agents are currently conducting searches according to previously compiled lists. (Reuters, 10th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Situation in Oslo After Its Fall</h3>
<p>Oslo: Oslo's fall did not involve significant resistance. Many residents of the city stood still and watched as German troops passed through the city's main streets. Upon landing, the German commander immediately went to the headquarters of the Norwegian police department to control all orders. The first batch of 300 German troops to enter the city included both those on horseback and those on foot. Observers said that they saw several Norwegian officers and German officers riding in the same car through the city. A German minesweeper was badly damaged while docking in Oslo Harbor. In the twenty hours before the German troops occupied the city, the outskirts of the city were bombed by German aircraft. In addition to occupying Oslo, the Germans also occupied the naval base of Horten at the entrance to Oslofjord. (Associated Press, 10th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Narvik's Fall - Two Norwegian Warships and Two British Ships Sunk in Resistance to German Warships</h3>
<p>Stockholm: Yesterday, two Norwegian warships attempted to prevent German destroyers from entering the port and were attacked by mines. Before German troops occupied Narvik, a Norwegian port for transporting iron ore to Germany, they had suffered severe damage. At that time, two British ships were docked in the port and fired cannons at German warships carrying a large number of weapons, attempting to resist the German warships' shelling, and were also sunk. At this time, 1,500 German troops launched an attack on Narvik starting at 4:50 a.m. Two German warships entered the port in heavy snow, which seemed to be covering the German troops' actions, as the German advance was not discovered until they entered the port and fired cannons at the two ships. At that time, one British warship and one German merchant ship, upon seeing the German warships, were greatly surprised. The British ship immediately retaliated with small cannons, and one Norwegian warship also fired at the German warships. The German warships immediately launched torpedoes, and the warship was sunk. Of the 562 crew members, only 20 were reportedly rescued. The Germans were able to reach the center of the city at 5:05 a.m. and occupied the city at 5:30 a.m., as the Norwegian army on the shore did not offer resistance. However, it was reported that one Norwegian soldier and one policeman were shot. The personnel of the local consulate moved elsewhere when the shelling began. After the German warships engaged in combat with merchant ships in the port, German troops wearing helmets landed immediately. When the German troops landed, the residents remained silent and watched. All merchant ship crew members left their ships and went ashore, and were replaced by German crew members. There are 3,000 Norwegian troops in the area, but most are scattered in the valleys. When the German warships entered the port, the people on the shore initially thought they were British warships. It was not until the German warships fired cannons that they realized it was a German attack and were all terrified. Narvik's defensive capabilities were very weak. The port only had two warships engaged in combat with the German troops. They were sunk before even getting a shot off. (Associated Press, 10th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Swedish Government Declares Strict Neutrality; Practically Already Isolated; Ultimately Inevitable to be Drawn into the Vortex of War</h3>
<p>Stockholm: According to Swedish Prime Minister Hansson, Germany sent a letter requesting Sweden to strictly adhere to neutrality. The Swedish government replied that it intends to maintain neutrality as usual, but reserves the freedom to take all plans necessary to maintain and defend neutrality. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: At noon today, Sweden implemented partial air defense, as the Swedish situation is serious, and this step was taken. However, it is reported that it does not include a blackout or evacuation of residents, but rather the implementation of some air raid precautions, such as firefighting and first aid. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>London: Swedish sources here claim that the German government has not applied the same pressure to Sweden as it did to Denmark, forcing it to accept its "protection." At the same time, according to Reuters' diplomatic correspondent, Scandinavians feel that the Germans do not need to threaten Sweden. They only need to continue their current military operations in southern Norway to cut off Sweden's access to aid from the West, which will isolate it and naturally lead it to submit. Scandinavian sources in London believe that Germany's goal is to completely occupy Norway and Denmark in order to "surround Sweden, but not to take direct action against it at this stage." (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Foreign diplomatic circles here believe that Sweden's involvement in the European war is imminent. If Britain and France send a large army to Narvik to defend Kiruna, it is feared that German troops will also land in southern Sweden and invade northern Sweden from the Gulf of Bothnia. If German troops invade southern Sweden, it could immediately pose a threat to occupy Stockholm. (United Press, 10th)</p>
<h3>The Future of Denmark and Norway</h3>
<p>Amsterdam: The future of Denmark and Norway is currently being discussed by Germany. Neutral country correspondents say that the two countries may become protectorates of Germany, like Bohemia and Moravia, or vassals of Germany, like Slovakia, or suffer the same fate as Poland. It is expected that Germany will not relax its control over the two countries. Denmark is rich in agricultural products and will inevitably join the German economic system in the future. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>British Embassy in Norway Relocates; British Minister to Denmark Captured</h3>
<p>London: Officials have confirmed that the Norwegian government is now in Hamar. The British Minister to Norway and his staff are accompanying the Norwegian government. The British Foreign Office has communicated with the British Embassy in Norway and received news that the Norwegian government is determined to resist the war in good spirits. London believes that the British Minister to Denmark and his staff have likely been captured by the Germans. Even if this does not violate international law, it is a serious breach of international conventions. However, if the British Embassy staff are indeed detained, they may be released later. According to well-informed sources here, Denmark's status may be regarded as an occupied territory similar to the Czech Republic. Britain will soon explain the legal status of Denmark arising from the German invasion. Britain will also likely explain the status of Iceland and the Faroe Islands, which belong to Denmark.

<h3>Fierce Naval Battle Between British and German Navies off the Norwegian Coast; One British Ship Sunk, Three Heavily Damaged; Two German Heavy Cruisers Sunk</h3>
<p>London: The Admiralty announced that several British destroyers attacked German naval forces in Norwegian waters at dawn today and encountered strong resistance. The British destroyer "Hunter" (1,340 tons) has been sunk, and the destroyer flotilla leader "Hardy" (1,455 tons) has run aground. The remaining ships have retreated. The number of casualties on each ship is still unknown, but a detailed list will be released as soon as possible. The German losses are not yet known, but according to unconfirmed reports from Stockholm, one German cruiser has been sunk. A British submarine fired a torpedo at a German cruiser near southern Norway yesterday, and it is believed that the ship has been sunk. British bombers attacked a German cruiser near Bergen last night, hitting it with one bomb. At the same time, a British naval aviation bomber also attacked a German cruiser in Norwegian waters this morning, hitting it with three bombs. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>London: The Air Ministry issued a communiqué today stating that the British Air Force continuously attacked enemy cruisers in Bergen Bay last night. This was the first retaliatory measure taken by Britain after the German invasion of Norway. The German ships fired dense anti-aircraft fire at the time, but the British Air Force's attack caused heavy damage to the German ships, and among them, a cruiser was hit several times and suffered heavy damage. All aircraft returned safely to base after completing their missions. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>Berlin: A German communiqué issued today acknowledged that the cruisers "Blücher" and "Karlsruhe" had been sunk. The "Blücher" was heavily damaged outside Oslo while trying to silence the 11-inch guns on the shore, and then struck several mines and sank. The "Karlsruhe" was sunk after encountering fierce resistance at Kristiansand. Most of the crew members were rescued. The "Blücher" was a 10,000-ton heavy cruiser, newly built last year, equipped with eight 8-inch heavy guns and three aircraft. The "Karlsruhe" was a 6,000-ton cruiser of the Königsberg class, equipped with nine 5.6-inch guns and six 3.5-inch anti-aircraft guns, built in 1929. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German High Command issued a communiqué stating that the German Air Force inflicted a "crushing defeat" on the British Navy yesterday evening. All ships were almost directly hit, and it claimed that four British battleships were each hit by several bombs, and two other battleships were each hit by one bomb. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: According to news received here, a German cruiser is now berthed at the pier in Trondheim harbor. "Tidning报" reported that it heard late that there would be a major development in this harbor. Many believe that British ships will attempt to break into the harbor. According to news from Oslo, most of the city is under the control of German aircraft, and the number of landing troops is not large. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>Chamberlain Reports on British-German Naval Warfare; First Sea Lord Will Provide More Detailed Account in the House Today</h3>
<p>London: Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons today that First Sea Lord Churchill will present a report on the naval battles near Norway tomorrow. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>London: During the opening of the House of Commons today, Labour leader Attlee rose to speak and asked Prime Minister Chamberlain whether he would issue any detailed statement regarding the naval battle in the North Sea. The Prime Minister replied that he did not intend to make any general remarks regarding all aspects of the war. He hoped that more detailed information could be received when First Sea Lord Churchill made a statement tomorrow. However, the House would be very pleased to hear the account he had just received regarding the fierce battle between the British destroyer flotilla and the German Navy in Narvik this morning. Five British destroyers sailed into the bay and engaged six of the latest large German destroyers. The German-controlled shore batteries and newly installed coastal batteries also opened fire to assist. The British destroyer "Hunter" (1,340 tons) was sunk, the "Hardy" (1,455 tons) was heavily damaged and ran aground, the "Hotspur" (1,340 tons) was also heavily damaged, and the "Hostile" (1,340 tons) was slightly damaged. The remaining one was undamaged. The "Hotspur," after a fierce battle, was damaged and withdrew under the cover of the other two ships. The German destroyers did not seem to attempt to pursue. In addition, it is worth mentioning that six German merchant ships, largely loaded with German military supplies, have been sunk by British destroyers. When the British ships withdrew, they encountered the German ship "Ravensfels," loaded with German reserve ammunition, and sank it. (Cheers) The Prime Minister concluded by saying that this was all he knew, and the House would naturally not want him to say anything more. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>London: Lord Stanhope stated in the House of Lords today about the naval battle of Narvik, saying that in this very difficult battle, the British Navy used glorious actions to resist the superior German Navy. The traditional honor of the British Navy has been fully maintained. Naval officers all said that if they could fight this kind of battle several more times, the Germans would regret it more and more. We have undoubtedly inflicted sufficient pain on the enemy in the Battle of Narvik. Former Home Secretary Viscount Samuel rose to say that Lord Stanhope's statement had first reported the number of unfortunate deaths and injuries of our navy, and ended with the achievements of our destroyer fleet. This would give a very misleading impression. In the future, when the government makes reports, it should always first state the achievements of the British fleet and then the casualties suffered. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>British Aircraft Flocks Fly to the North Sea to Attack German Ships</h3>
<p>London: The British Air Ministry has just issued a communiqué stating, "Our aircraft flocks flew several times yesterday to the waters of Bergen Bay, Norway, to bomb German cruisers. Although enemy anti-aircraft fire was very fierce, one enemy ship was still heavily damaged, and all our aircraft have safely returned to their base." (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to official announcements, the German Air Force attacked British warships in the northern North Sea yesterday afternoon, hitting two British battleships, each with three bombs. Two heavy cruisers were also heavily damaged. One enemy ship was on fire, and another was tilted and unable to move. There was a lot of gasoline floating on the sea. (Haitong, 10th)</p>
<p>Oslo: Yesterday, British and German aircraft engaged in an aerial battle over Oslo. At that time, it was rumored here that a strong Allied air force was flying across the North Sea to aid Oslo. I saw German planes flying low over Oslo airfield, and many Norwegian planes were hit. However, the Norwegian Air Force bravely fought back. I have personally seen four German planes crash, and two Norwegian planes were also shot down. German bombers hit six planes at Fornebu Airport outside Oslo. No reports have yet been confirmed regarding other Allied aircraft heading to Oslo. However, it is rumored here that an Allied air force of 600 to 700 planes is now heading to Norway to assist. (United Press, 10th)</p>
<h3>Britain Practices its Promise to Aid Norway; Powerful Naval and Air Forces are Mobilized</h3>
<p>Paris: A French naval spokesman said that the British and French fleets in the North Sea are currently cooperating fully. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>London: After Germany's lightning invasion of Denmark and Norway, it is said that the first major naval battle between the British and German fleets has occurred in the turbulent waves off the Norwegian coast. Last night, the whole country was eagerly awaiting the outcome of this battle. Prime Minister Chamberlain told the House of Commons last night that the British strong fleet is currently at sea, implying that the navy will be able to prevent the German army from occupying Scandinavia, and that such good news will soon be transmitted. Although Chamberlain did not want to disclose the purpose of the navy's actions, he did not reject the possibility that the navy would have large-scale operations, such as escorting an expeditionary force to land on the Scandinavian Peninsula. The Prime Minister also confirmed the promise issued by the Foreign Office to provide full assistance to Norway. It is reported that British and French aircraft squadrons have now been dispatched to Norway. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary's Speech: Northern Europe Must Not Be Invaded; The Future of British-Soviet Relations Depends on the Extent to Which the Soviet Union is Willing to Aid Germany</h3>
<p>London: Foreign Secretary Halifax gave a speech here today, severely condemning the German army's attack on Denmark and Norway, saying that Germany's behavior is like a murderous madman, or a mad dog that bites anyone it sees. Today's war is not only a battle between belligerent countries. The outcome of this war is not only related to the fate of the warring countries, but also to the fate of all nations that love freedom and wish to preserve their independence. This point is now becoming increasingly clear. The political and military situation of the Scandinavian Peninsula is now chaotic, so the facts that have occurred cannot be fully known. It is rumored that Norway is now preparing to negotiate with Germany, but he does not know whether this statement is credibly based. If it is credibly based, then he dares to believe that the Allied governments will regard the Norwegian government as being coerced into doing so, and our determination to resist such barbarous manifestations on behalf of the powerless Norwegian country, and to resist Germany's expansion of strategic power in the North Sea and the Atlantic, will not change in the slightest because of this. Because Britain will never allow Germany to take this action. The Foreign Secretary then mentioned the British Navy, saying that everyone can recognize that the Navy is not slacking off now. The government is about to release information that is as detailed as possible to address public concerns. We are not yet able to determine the motives for Germany's initiation of conflict on the Scandinavian Peninsula. This may be due to the weakness within Germany that we may not fully know, but I intend I can affirm this, and this move may not bring pure benefits to Germany. I believe that this incident contains a kind of morality for neutral countries. Britain or France could have chosen a port or base in Norway at any time in the past six months and occupied it. If the neutral countries are not prepared to apply for assistance in a timely manner, then such events, I dare to predict, will inevitably be discovered, and they will apply for assistance when they are unable to provide effective assistance. Seeing that Germany chooses its neighbors with weak defenses for this invasion, this is in line with the cowardly practice of choosing the weak to attack. The Foreign Secretary then recounted the state of Germany tearing up the German-Danish non-aggression pact, and then said that the Norwegian government had been careful not to give Germany an excuse to initiate conflict. It can be seen from this that non-aggression pacts and careful self-preservation, if they are not beneficial to German policy, are of no use in avoiding Germany's aggressive policies.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary then recounted the various ways in which Germany's past actions violated the provisions of international law, and said, I expect the world to believe that the Allies can no longer tolerate such obvious acts of injustice, so the Allies have taken responsive measures, one of which is to lay mines in key sea areas. Today, anyone who is not in a position to defend themselves and encounters Germany's actions has no way to protect their safety. This is already a clear fact.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary continued, Today, some people want Britain to declare war on the Soviet Union, and some people want Britain to be friendly with the Soviet Union. We are not considering this issue because of our opposition to the Soviet Union's violent attacks on Poland and Finland. My opinion is that, in the current situation, we should still adhere to the main goal, which is to defeat Germany. The future of our relationship with the Soviet Union must and should depend on the extent to which the Soviet Union is willing to provide effective assistance to Germany for any reason. Other than this, everything else is insignificant. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>London: Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State Butler stated in the House of Commons today in response to questions that the British government has not recently conducted negotiations with the Soviet Union regarding the continued discussion of trade issues. However, the Soviet ambassador to Britain mentioned this matter in recent conversations with the British Foreign Secretary. He also said that the date for the British ambassador to the Soviet Union to return to his post has not yet been determined. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Broadcasts: Sympathy for Norway and Denmark; Fighting Alongside Norway; Indignation at the German Invasion of Denmark</h3>
<p>London: British Foreign Secretary Halifax gave a broadcast in Norwegian last night, expressing Britain's sympathy and encouragement for the resistance of the Norwegian government and people against the German invasion. He said, Norway is one of the world's leaders in peaceful technology and good administration. Britain and Norway should fight side by side until victory is achieved. The Foreign Secretary also broadcasted in Danish, saying that this is the second time that Denmark has suffered Germany's barbaric invasion. The British people are deeply indignant when they hear the news of the German invasion of Denmark, and are more determined to fight hard until Europe is freed from the harm of German aggression. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>Lord Harley's Speech: Warning the Civil Defense Forces to Prepare</h3>
<p>London: Lord Harley, head of civil defense affairs for the northeast region of Britain, gave a speech in Hull last night, issuing a warning, saying, We are now entering a new stage in the war. All men serving in the civil defense forces must be prepared. The people of the Scandinavian Peninsula, who are now suffering the most barbaric and brutal aggression, are the ones who are most closely aligned with the British in terms of sentiment and shared interests. No one knows where the war will spread after it breaks out, so we must prepare early. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

<h3>American Oil Arriving in Vladivostok Has Not Been Shipped to Germany</h3>
<p>London: British Minister of Economic Warfare Cross declared to Parliament yesterday that gasoline shipped from the United States to Vladivostok has not reached Germany. In response to an inquiry from a certain member, he said that he believed that the American oil shipped across the Pacific to Vladivostok last year was needed by the Soviet Union and was used for the Far East, and was never transported to Germany. Although the Soviet Union's gasoline import volume exceeded that of 1938, it did not exceed the previous years. At that time, Liberal Party member Mander asked whether Mr. Cross must know that 2.14 million barrels of American oil were delivered to Vladivostok in September last year, and asked what steps the government would take to prevent the reshipment of these supplies that strengthened the enemy. Cross replied that he did not know whether this number was accurate and would need to review the facts. (United Press, 10th)</p>

<h3>Netherlands Not Anxious; Continues to Adopt Military Precautions; Cabinet Discusses its Position in the Crisis; Belgium Solemnly Declares its Determination to Maintain Neutrality</h3>
<p>Amsterdam: The Netherlands does not feel anxious about its immediate future. The Cabinet held an emergency meeting to consider the Netherlands' position in the new crisis. At that time, it was decided to suspend army leave, but as Reuters reporters heard, this step was not because the Netherlands believed that it was threatened, but to make it clear that the Netherlands was determined to resist invasion. The Netherlands has a more powerful army than the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula, and its weapons and preparations are also better, and it has a famous water defense line. The Netherlands has been constantly working to improve its defenses in the past few months, and there is no fear of being trampled by iron hooves overnight. In recent days, the Netherlands has continued to take several kinds of military precautions in light of the serious situation. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

<p>Brussels: Belgian officials are maintaining silence regarding the situation in Northern Europe. The general tendency of the people is to maintain a policy of strict neutrality. Prime Minister Pierlot and Foreign Minister Spaak yesterday called on Belgian newspapers to adopt a cautious attitude in their comments on the situation and to pay attention to Belgium's neutral position. According to the Times here, the Belgian Ministry of Defense has not taken any other measures in response to the current situation. (Haitong, 10th)</p>
<p>London: A statement issued by the London official stated that the German claim that the Allies intended to invade the Netherlands or Belgium was absurd. The German side believed that since Britain intended to invade the Netherlands or Belgium, Germany had good reason to act first. It is also in line with expectations that enemy countries would fabricate rumors to provide a basis for their invasion of other neutral countries. Its statement that Britain and France intend to invade the Netherlands and Belgium is extremely absurd, and no one believes it except the Germans. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>British Research: Strategy Against Germany – Aiming for Bergen, Norway, as a Major Target for Advance</h3>
<p>London – A Reuters military correspondent reports that if Britain dispatches an expeditionary force to fight in Norway, the sheltered bays along the Norwegian coast will likely assume great importance. Joint operations involving the army, navy, and air force will be extremely difficult, requiring extensive staff work. Weather conditions will be a crucial factor. The success or failure of such military operations, especially during landings, will depend on the convenience of cover. The bays of Norway can provide the expeditionary force with highly ideal protection. It appears the British forces will not land north of Bergen, due to the difficult terrain further north and the greater distance from Oslo, which is, of course, one of the primary targets for advance. If the Allied forces capture Bergen, they can control the dangerous passage to the Skagerrak Strait and clear mines disrupting navigation in this narrow waterway. However, whether or not the British expeditionary force departs, Hitler is already fighting on two fronts. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>Shipping Restrictions in Denmark and Sweden</h3>
<p>Copenhagen – The Danish Ministry of Commerce yesterday issued a decree that all Danish merchant ships and fishing boats cease sailing to foreign ports.

<h3>One Soldier Killed Outside Jiangyin's North Gate – Puppet Authorities Audaciously Plan to Levy Land Tax</h3>
<p>Hupu Correspondence: Jiangyin's North Gate, once a vital point for counties north of the Yangtze River, has transformed significantly over the past two years. A Japanese naval garrison is stationed at Huangtiangang. The day before yesterday, two Japanese soldiers, armed with firearms, were buying food pots in the main street outside the North Gate. One of them was shot dead by guerrillas, while the other escaped to the port and telephoned the city to report the incident. Subsequently, a large number of Japanese troops arrived at the scene and conducted a search, destroying the food pot shop completely. Residents and shopkeepers in the vicinity were severely beaten. The reason given for the beatings was that the local populace had failed to report the presence of guerrillas and plainclothes soldiers in the area beforehand and had allowed them to escape afterward. The puppet authorities, facing dwindling funds, had requested the Japanese garrison to dispatch more than thirty Japanese soldiers, disguised as puppet police, wearing Japanese uniforms, to be stationed in the Guoxiang, Zhouzhuang, Huashi, and Houteng areas at the end of last month, led by puppet land tax director Zhang Youlan and others, audaciously planning to levy land tax. However, as Dongxiang is a guerrilla stronghold, the Japanese soldiers were uneasy and forcibly conscripted villagers to build defensive fortifications around their encampments. Once the fortifications were completed, they remained holed up, afraid to venture out.</p>

<h3>US President Declares Intention to Revise Neutrality Act, Will Decide if a State of War Exists Between Germany and Denmark</h3>
<p>Washington – After the news of Germany's occupation of Denmark and invasion of Norway reached the United States, the US government was compelled to engage in detailed discussions to determine diplomatic policy. The development of the situation in Northern Europe, its direct impact, and the overall war situation have generated speculation as to whether this situation will escalate into a major war, or merely intensify the existing economic warfare. Authorities recognize Germany's evident advancement, while many observers believe that the British navy will remain the main force in the overall war situation. President Roosevelt, speaking to reporters last night upon returning to Washington from Hyde Park, said that with the expansion of the European war to Northern Europe, he might immediately amend the US Neutrality Act. President Roosevelt also stated that this amendment would be released upon his arrival at the White House. The events of the past forty-eight hours have undoubtedly caused many Americans to consider the war's implications for the United States. After arriving in Washington, the President further stated that he might immediately determine whether a state of war exists between German troops and Denmark, and the circumstances of the German-Norwegian situation, and would decide the extent to which the scope of the war would further expand due to the new developments in Northern Europe. Democratic Senator George stated that the invasion of Northern Europe marked the beginning of a large-scale war. Senator Gillette predicted that a similar situation might arise in the Balkans, and stated that he hoped the United States would declare a one-week neutrality act for Northern Europe, which would place the entire American war effort, equipment, and other supplies to Denmark and Norway on a practical and effective basis. (United Press, 10th)</p>
<p>Washington – Secretary of State Hull declared here last night that the Neutrality Act could be applied to the desecration of territory.

<p>London – Foreign diplomats here conferred last night that if the Allied forces and Germany make contact in northern Sweden, extending the war to the Finnish border, then the Soviet Union's attitude may once again become crucial. Finnish diplomatic circles today expressed unease, fearing that Soviet troops might reoccupy Finland to prevent the Allied forces or Germany from invading Finnish territory. Soviet officials here made no indication of Moscow's intentions. (United Press, 10th)</p>
<p>Istanbul – Turkish military circles commented last night that if war breaks out between the Allied forces and Germany in Norway, they expect the Soviet Union may join the Scandinavian conflict. Another military source believes that the Soviet Union may occupy Finnish seaports and northern Sweden, depending on the scale of the Allied forces' operations in Scandinavia. (United Press, 10th)</p>
<p>London – According to Soviet sources in London, the Soviet Union's attitude towards the events in Denmark and Norway may not follow the direction indicated in the speech by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on March 29. There is no reason to assume that yesterday's events will cause the Soviet Union to change its policy of maintaining neutrality and avoiding participation in the war. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

<h3>US Chamber of Commerce Considers Retaliation Against Japan – Annual Meeting on the 29th</h3>
<p>Washington – According to today's news, at the US Chamber of Commerce's annual meeting on the 29th of this month, a proposal to strengthen American policy in the Far East will be considered. The proposal includes the issue of how the United States should retaliate against Japan's restrictions on American trade in China. The US Chamber of Commerce has already released proposals from various chambers of commerce and the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. The proposals from the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai are: (1) To develop and maintain American commercial opportunities in China, equal to those of other countries; (2) To demand that the US government's declared policies hold countries at war in the Far East fully responsible for damages to American citizens; (3) If Japan restricts and discriminates against American commerce in China, the United States should adopt reciprocal measures in its trade with Japan; (4) To develop the American merchant marine using effective and reliable crews. These proposals will form the basis of the US Chamber of Commerce's policies for the year. (United Press, 10th)</p>
<h3>Panama Canal Lock Construction Approved by US Senate</h3>

<h3>Japanese Newspapers Report on Northern European War – Also Acknowledge German Aggression</h3>
<p>Hong Kong – Tokyo dispatch: All evening newspapers here have featured headlines on the German use of force against Denmark and Norway. The wording used in the headlines often includes phrases such as "National Socialists invade Denmark, occupy Copenhagen," "German troops occupy Bergen, Norway," and "Norway declares war on Germany." Some newspapers released special editions. (Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Business circles here believe that Japan will not be severely affected by the new developments in Northern Europe, as the commercial relationship between Japan and Norway and Denmark is not significant. In recent years, trade between Japan and these two countries has declined. However, Norway's declaration of war on Germany will affect Japanese shipping activities, as a large number of Norwegian ships are currently operating in the Far East. It is believed that these ships will soon withdraw from the Far East, making the shortage of ship space more acute. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

<h3>Governor's Cup Football in Hong Kong – Chinese United Team Retains Championship – Li Huitang Does Not Play – Chen Dehui Scores Two Goals Alone</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) With continuous rain for days, it was expected that the Governor's Cup schedule would become a problem. Fortunately, the heavens helped, and in the afternoon of the 17th, it was barely raining, so this highly anticipated second battle of the Governor's Cup was able to be held as scheduled. Enthusiastic fans came in droves, and ticket revenue exceeded 2,500, which is not bad. After 90 minutes of intense fighting, the result was a 2-2 draw. According to the Governor's Cup system, the Chinese United team has already won one game and drawn one game, for a total of three points. The Western United team drew one game and only got one point. The Chinese United team thus won the three-time championship, fulfilling the ambition of tying the Western United team in terms of color sharing (in this eight-session, each has gained the championship four times). After the competition, the award was given by Assistant Secretary of Foreign Affairs Shi Mei. All the Chinese fans were very happy. The association held a celebration banquet at the Jinling Restaurant on the evening of the 18th, with toasts and exchanges of cups. It was a grand occasion. The ball lamps were bright, and the silver whistles sounded. Both sides lined up. Except for Li Huitang's absence due to a sore on his back, the lineup of the Chinese United team remained unchanged. Commander Chen Dehui was devoted to his duties and fulfilled his responsibilities, scoring two goals alone. The entire audience praised him. Hou Chengtong performed at his peak, and his passing was exceptionally wonderful, but due to bad luck, many of his powerful shots were blocked and bounced out by Luo Bianchen. Luo Bianchen's good skills and position deserve praise. Li Tiansheng was the biggest contributor to the defense. Liu Xianhan was not stage-shy and made excellent saves. Although Guo Yingqi did his best yesterday, his performance did not reach his standard. His performance between offense and defense was greatly affected. Zhong Yongshen also performed abnormally and was at fault.</p>
<p>The Western United team had six members who did not come, including Da Gaoshan, Sa La, Bifu, Williamson, Wei Lugan, and He Xi, and were supplemented by backups. Only Gan performed well. The rest were mediocre. Li Anna missed many opportunities, and Han Nibo's lack of power was even less worth mentioning. The Western United team was able to tie the Chinese United team due to the tightness of the defense, not the sharpness of the forwards. Shi scored a goal alone, which is evident. A half-and-half draw was a great achievement, but it was not enough to save the overall situation. However, if the Western United team can all take the stage and go all out, then the Chinese United team may also lose, and there will be another final.</p>

<h3>Samsung Rallies and Revamps: A Brand New Lineup</h3>
<p>Youngsters' Cup Tournament Participation; Dong Wah Stars Added</p>
<p>The Samsung Football Club, which won the All Shanghai Little Football and Mini Football Championships for five consecutive years from 1935 to 1939, under the leadership of its president, Mr. Wu Yanan, and chief manager, Mr. Ding Du, has won championships such as the Shanghai East Cup, the City One Cup, the Jinde Cup, and the Fudan Cup before the war, and the Lianyi Cup, the Jinrong Cup, the Rainbow Cup, the Private Shanghai High School Cup, the Lianmei Cup, and the Faber Cup and other overall championships after the war. Members of the club have included Shanghai team representatives for the inter-port cup such as Wu Shaotai, Yan Shixin, Li Yichen, Meng Yiliang, and Feng Shoupeng. The club has defeated strong Western teams such as St. Francis, the Army, and the Socal, and is the only ever-victorious general in the Shanghai small football scene. After the Faber Cup ended last year, the club originally planned to organize a football team to participate in the Western League, but was temporarily suspended due to other reasons. Now, soccer pioneer Zhang Zhihe and others have initiated the Youngsters' Cup All Shanghai Small Football Championship. The club president Wu Yanan, coach Shen Huichun, and manager Ding Du, among others, recently held a meeting to discuss and decide to resume organization. Although the club's stars such as Yan Shixin, Yu Zhenyue, and Chen Yuanji have been recruited by Lido and other teams, the club authorities have invited Dong Wah's Jia Youliang, Wan Jin, Wu Binghao, You You Gexizuo, Zhou Qi, and other famous players to join, which makes it even better.

<h3>Finance: The Concept of a Declining Exchange Rate Suddenly Fades; the US Dollar Once Hit a Tight Price...Profitable Resales Were Active at Noon</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation was affected by the sharp drop in overseas exchange rates, including the fall of 9.175 points against the pound. Therefore, the US dollar listing in this city was reduced by 125 points, retreating to $5.75, which was the tightest price since September 19 of last year. The Dutch Guilder also shrank, while other currencies such as the pound were stable. As for the domestic market situation, the environment changed rapidly, people were confused, and actions were inconsistent. In the early morning, the US dollar softened by 0.0625 to $5.90625 due to the sharp fall in the US-British exchange rate, while the British gold did not change. Later, the Japanese Bank Zhengjin and others frantically bought US dollars for 500,000 yuan, and speculators also scrambled to acquire them, mostly US dollars for April and May. At that time, the US Bank supplied the US dollar futures in a steady manner. However, the spot US dollar eventually showed a sluggish trend, and once saw an unprecedented tight price of $5.875. However, foreign telegrams suddenly reported that Minister of Finance Simon stated that the weakness of the pound was purely a normal phenomenon after exchange rate control and there was absolutely no need to worry. As a result, people's minds changed, and sellers emerged one after another, which led to a firmer market. The closing price of British gold remained unchanged, and the exchange rate was $5.9375, which was $5.454375 in combined exchange rate, resulting in a tight continuation of 0.03125 compared to the previous day. The potential of futures was slightly different from the spot price. Date is visible.</p>
<p>The Japanese Bank Closed with 500,000 Inflow</p>
<p>In the early morning, according to London, the near and far terms each increased by 375 points. Exchange rates for British against US, Shanghai, and French currencies were all flat. US against British currencies fell by 9.375 points, against Shanghai decreased by 0.25 yuan, against French currency decreased by a small 0.0525 yuan. The central listing of various currencies remained the same. Banks opened spot selling prices in the morning, British gold was 4 shillings 1.125 pence, the US dollar was $5.90625, compared to the previous closing, British currency remained flat and the US dollar tightened by 0.0625 due to the continued decline in exchange rates. After opening, the Japanese Bank and speculators came together to purchase April and May US dollar futures, and there were profitable closures of spot British gold, but banks such as Chase were still willing to supply, so the futures market remained stable. The spot US dollar continued to soften slightly, with transactions including opening bids of 4 shillings 1.125 pence, and this month's US dollar at $5.84375 and $5.8325, and May US dollar futures at $5.65625 and $5.625. At that time, the spot US dollar shrank to $5.875, but there were few opening transactions. The HSBC listing was announced, British currency remained flat and the US dollar shrank by 0.125. The silver balancing tax was announced to rise by 0.02 yuan. After that, Hong Kong Electric suddenly vomited spot US dollars, and at the same time, foreign telegrams reported that Minister of Finance Simon claimed that the lower price of the pound was a normal phenomenon after governance. Therefore, the local speculators' concept of a declining exchange rate suddenly faded, and the buyers remained silent. On the contrary, it caused profiteers to emerge, so the market gradually became firm. Hong Kong Electric sold spot US dollars to foreign firms at $5.9275, and speculators stuffed this month's US dollar futures to foreign firms at $5.875, and May US dollar futures at $5.6875. At the same time, foreign firms sold spot US dollars to Chinese banks in Shanghai at $5.90625. At noon, foreign firms were quite sincere, and the situation continued. By the close, the spot US dollar had returned to $5.9375, and British gold was still at 4 shillings 9.96875 pence. The result was that compared to the previous day, spot British currency remained flat and the US dollar tightened by 0.03125. This month's British currency also remained flat and the US dollar softened by 0.03125. There were no changes in British and US dollar futures for May. There is no market on Wednesday afterwards.</p>
<p>Hong Kong US Dollar Shrunk Sharply Again</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 10th (Reuters) - This morning, spot prices remained unchanged. The spot US dollar shrunk sharply by half a yuan to $21.4375. There were quoted prices for forward contracts, but no market. The Shanghai dollar spot price rose by 0.50 yuan. The Japanese Yen also tightened by 3.00 yuan, to 90.00 yuan. The price was flat at 11:30. The Shanghai dollar spot price continued to rise by 0.50 yuan, to 360.00 yuan. There were no other changes. There is no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Tianjin British and US Currencies Remained Flat</p>
<p>Tianjin, 10th (Wednesday Dispatch) - This morning, the exchange market opened flat. Spot prices for British currency, Shanghai currency, and the "Joint Note" black market were all unchanged. The spot US dollar shrunk by 0.15625 to $5.5625.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Rise and Fall Rapidly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation was full of stormy waves, with huge ups and downs. British and US gold pounds initially followed the rapid rise in gold prices. Afterwards, as gold prices fell together, the buying stopped. The supply and demand of British gold notes remained balanced. The price of US gold notes once reached $16.95, but then sellers rushed to close out their positions for profits, and the price fell to a low of $16.63. In the afternoon, it rose again to $16.77. The trend of Hong Kong notes was also strong. The demand for Dutch and Philippine notes was not weak. The demand for Canadian notes was quite strong, and the market price rose to $1.1325. The trend of Korean notes remained soft, and the evening market was $1.1125. The exchange rates of various currencies are detailed in the market price network.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Rises by Another $3.50</h3>
<p>Interbank Lending Rate Also Increases Greatly</p>
<p>Yesterday's bill discount standard continued to rise. The discount rate per thousand once soared to over $70. In the morning, it flew from around $67 to $73. After 10 o'clock, it gradually fell back. In the afternoon, the changes were small, around $69, which was $3.50 higher than the previous day. The Shanghai Money Dealers Association's interbank lending rate was quoted at $0.21 in both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3>The Gold Market Is Volatile and Unstable; After a Wild Increase, It Plunges Again; Ultimately, There Is No Difference in Price Compared to the Previous Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold black market situation rose sharply and then closed flat. The buying and selling were quite large, which made the price extremely volatile. The morning opening had already risen sharply by $45 to $5,700 because of the sharp fall in exchange rates that day. Later, when the US dollar tightened, buyers followed one another, and in the imbalance of supply and demand, a new gold record of $5,750 was created. At that time, money exchange shops and banks were the most enthusiastic in buying. However, the good times quickly changed. Foreign telegrams reported that British Finance Minister Simon claimed that the decline in the pound was a natural phenomenon after exchange control and there was no significant impact on the currency value. As a result, the US dollar in this city rebounded, and there were rumors that were unfavorable to buyers. In an instant, gold shops, banks, and some securities firm employees rushed to sell, and the selling frenzy prevailed, causing the price to plummet. The lowest price was $5,635, which was $20 lower than the previous day. Fortunately, gold shops bought back, which resulted in the closing price being flat, still at $5,655, the same as the previous day. This was $15 higher than the noon closing price. The final price was $5,670. The half-day transaction was still active, about 3,000 taels. Jewelry gold once hit an unprecedented price of $575, but then returned to flat. Customs gold remained stable.</p>
<p>Gold Reaches New High Price</p>
<p>Since the initial opening of each bar (10 taels) in the morning, exchange rates shrank by 9.375 points, and the US dollar tightened, so people's hearts were strong. The opening jumped up by $45. Gold shops and banks purchased dozens of taels in total, at $5,700. Afterwards, the US dollar continued to weaken, and the buying trend became even stronger. Money exchange shops, securities firms, and others rushed to buy, and in less than ten minutes, the price was raised by another $50. Banks sold to counterparties at $5,750. Unexpectedly, at the same time, a gold shop sold sharply at a high price, and some securities firms also vigorously sold. Then, the price fell back by dozens of dollars. Later, the US dollar suddenly rebounded, and the buying interest was even stronger for a time, returning to the $5,700 level. Gold shops sold 50 taels to money exchange shops for $5,675. Shortly afterwards, a gold shop suddenly came to buy again, and at the same time banks and others also dragged in retail investors, and at that time the US dollar stabilized, rising again by $35. Gold shops sold 50 taels to money exchange shops and others for $5,710. Later, because the foreign exchange US dollar relapsed, coupled with some securities firms taking the opportunity to sell again, it soon returned to the $5,700 level. Then, with the addition of bank assistance to sell, the selling frenzy grew from small to large, and it fell back by dozens of dollars. Banks sold 20 taels to securities firms at $5,635. At noon, sellers gradually decreased, and a gold shop suddenly came to search for purchases, rising by $45. Gold shops purchased 30 taels from banks at $5,680. Near the close, another gold shop sold vigorously, returning down $25. Gold shops sold 30 taels to securities firms for $5,655, as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, there is no market on Friday. As a result, there was no difference in price compared to the previous day. The half-day fluctuation was $115. The selling price of the cash gold shops was several dollars higher than the gold price, and the purchase price was reduced by $20. The current standard gold was more than $50 higher than the listed gold, and there were few opening transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Rose and Then Returned</p>
<p>The initial exchange price of jewelry gold in silver shops was still $570 at Datongxing. By 9:30, it was $5 higher, hitting an unprecedented high price of $575. At 11:10, it fell back by a small $5. There were no changes after that. As a result, Datongxing was still $570, and the new counterparts were the same as the previous price. The purchase price was reduced by about $15.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth: The Market Sentiment Is Excited; Yarn Prices Rise Straight Up</h3>
<p>"Bian Ma" (Brand) Rises to $1275</p>
<p>The yarn market has surged. The European war seems to be expanding, and the price of gold is soaring, causing people's hearts to be excited and triggering a buying frenzy. The market is soaring. The spot price of 20-count "Bian Ma" (Brand) yarn is as high as $1,275 for Huidah. The closing price is $1,254.</p>
<p>At the opening of the spot yarn market this morning, it was heard that British and American exchange rates had fallen sharply and the exchange market was shrinking, which boosted people's spirits. The spot price of 20-count "Bian Ma" (Brand) yarn was $1,250. At this time, there were few sellers. At the same time, although the demand from Guangdong merchants was not as strong as the previous day, sporadic transactions were still uninterrupted, so the momentum was still strong, rising to $1,275. Then, due to profiteers selling, it fell back to $1,250. It is found that the transaction volume in half a day was 1,795 bales, and the market price of 20-count "Bian Ma" (Brand) yarn rose by $56. Today, 51 pieces of yarn are transported to Tianjin. The amount bought by each gang is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Counterparts: 1,335; Hong Kong: 460.</p>
<p>Total: 1,795</p>
<h3>Counterparts Compete to Purchase; Cotton Prices Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>The trading of native cotton has slightly improved, but it is said that it is a mutual purchase between counterparts. This is because yarn prices are rising steadily, which has led to the rise of raw cotton, which is interdependent. However, the plant's actions are still rare, so the prices of all cotton types have risen by $3, $4, or $5. The transaction situation of spot cotton is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Another message: Foreign cotton market prices, the New York cotton market rose early in the morning due to good telegrams from Liverpool and a firm Indian cotton market. Later, due to the sudden changes in the European situation, overseas merchants purchased in the market, and as a result, the closing price was higher than the previous day, with the recent period rising by 4 or 5 pounds, and the distant period rising by 6 pounds. The Indian cotton market was also exceptionally enthusiastic due to the European situation. Yesterday, together with forecasts, it surged by 18 rupees. Egyptian rose by more than 10 pounds.</p>
<p>Shanghai port's foreign cotton transactions, due to the soaring of foreign cotton markets and the step-by-step following of yarn prices, each counterpart deeply worried that the ships transporting Indian cotton to Shanghai would have difficulties, so the purchase of spot goods in the market was quite fierce. The selling price was higher than the futures price. However, even with high prices, it was difficult to purchase large quantities. The factory price of yesterday's cotton market is converted at an exchange rate of US$5.9375 as follows.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Prices Continue to Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth price increase was still strong, and new highs were created again. White cloth, fine cloth, twill, and coarse cloth rose by 50 cents to $1 per piece in the morning, and continued to rise by about 50 cents in the afternoon. The market for bleached and dyed cloth was chaotic, and there was no definite price. Generally, each piece rose by about $1. Merchants in the street continued to purchase more than 500 pieces of coarse cloth from factories such as Dapeng, Fugui, and Sanmao, fine cloth, twill, and Yihe. Cantonese merchants handled more than 200 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, poplin, and bleached cloth. Henan and Anhui merchants handled more than 100 pieces of colored cloth, striped bleached cloth, and poplin. Sichuan and Yunnan merchants handled more than 100 pieces of Shilin cloth, fine cloth, and printed cloth. Zhejiang, Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Ningbo merchants handled 150-160 pieces of fine cloth, coarse cloth, and twill. Foreign merchants in Singapore handled more than 5,000 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth. Also, on the 11th, four pieces of piece goods were transported to Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Most Woolen Fabrics Are Ordered from England</h3>
<p>Italian Goods Require US Dollars</p>
<p>Most of the major wholesalers in the woolen fabric industry order from England. This is because the price of goods in Shanghai is high, various goods are in short supply, and English goods are still priced in shillings and do not require payment of silver. Orders from Italy, according to telegrams from agencies, are all changed to US dollars, so the price increase is more expensive than English goods. In addition, most of them still require a 30% deposit in advance, which has created a larger business for ordering woolen fabrics from England.</p>
<h3>Securities: Many "Tong Bing" (Type C) Shares Sold</h3>
<p>Foreign Stocks Had No Special Characteristics</p>
<p>The securities black market was depressed yesterday because of the lottery for Type C shares. However, it seems that there is still a good demand for these shares, but there is no imminent danger of a collapse. However, the soaring gold market has softened people's hearts, and there is no longer the excitement of the past. The future may be a period of circling. Yesterday, the prices of Type C shares, which were not selected in the lottery, broke through the $50 level, and Type B shares also broke through the $2 level. Although the buyers were still enthusiastic, they were already shrouded in a selling atmosphere. However, the decline was greater, and in the afternoon, the buyers again took the upper hand, and all items rebounded by 20-30 cents. The buyers still had remaining strength, and the market situation became firm. As a result, the price continued to be slightly smaller by 0.10-0.45. The total transaction volume was about 1.2 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock transactions included 150 shares of China Merchants Electric at a price of $7.90.</p>
<p>There were no special characteristics in the stock market of public companies, and the prices were rarely volatile. The opening price was the same as the previous closing price. Then, because buyers took advantage of the low prices to purchase, the market situation slightly improved, and then turned quieter. Under the current state of uncertainty, if the stock market's actions are good, there is nothing to criticize. Rubber stocks had a slight turnaround due to the large increase in spot prices abroad, but buyers did not seem impatient, so the prices were also flat.</p>
<p>London, 9th (Tuesday Dispatch) - Today's listed prices of British Far East company stocks, only Gula Clark and Lem Rubber stocks fell by 3 pence, the price was 18 shillings 6 pence, the rest were flat.</p>
<p>London, 9th (Tuesday Dispatch) - Today's listed Chinese foreign debts remained high and stable, and there were no changes in the bonds at various levels.</p>
<h3>Millington Company Pays Dividends</h3>
<p>The 10th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of the American Millington Company will be held on April 26. According to reports, the profit for 1939 reached more than 91,000 yuan in national currency, and the dividend is proposed to be 10%.</p>
<h3>Food: Rice Prices Rebound and Rise</h3>
<p>The rice market currently plummeted again in the morning market, and immediately turned to ban again in the afternoon market. Yesterday, due to the small source of domestic rice from the mainland, a total of only more than 1,000 bags were exported from Hongkou, and gold prices rose and exchange rates continued to shrink. The rice merchants held back their goods and waited for the opportunity again. Rural villages and customer shops searched in many ways. Both domestic and foreign rice in the early market saw prices rise steadily. If the domestic rice sees early and late rice has opened at $40 and $39.50, Suzhou Tongbang Su Fen Geng at $40, and Dantu glutinous rice at $37.50, and then down to $35, while the foreign rice No. 1 Saigon was $42.20, $42, a sharp increase of $1 or $2 compared to the previous market. It was also heard that off-market black market trading rose against each other, with Changbang special rice at $43, Kun Geng at $42.50, $42, Qing Si special thin at $42, and Jiangbei sharp at $40. However, the overall situation is full of changes, although it rebounded one morning, people inevitably still harbor precautions, and if the price is too high, it is also tricky. Therefore, the sales market weakened again in the afternoon market, and the market price depreciated by 20-30 cents.</p>
<p>Foreign rice is constantly arriving in Shanghai. Yesterday, Taikoo Company's Qingyuan wheel arrived in port, carrying 3,024 bags from Hong Kong. Today, Jardine Matheson's Lisheng wheel is going to North China, with 500 bags of foreign rice going to Tianjin.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice was stimulated by the exchange rate shrinking and gold prices rising, and the market had a big breathing space. The buying interest was extremely strong in the morning, especially the internal and external speculation and floating households were the most greedy. Because the exchange rate has shrunk and the production price is high, people's hearts suddenly turned upward. No. 1 Saigon, which closed at $40.05 the previous day, was raised to $42.50, and No. 1 was also close to $40. Huo Jiao rose to $41, and other high- and low-end grades generally rose, about $2 greater than the previous day. Then, because the floating households took profits and came out, and it was reported that a large amount of Dumai from the mainland was about to be shipped to Shanghai, people's hearts suddenly softened, and the market price fell by a small 50 cents to nearly one yuan. The situation continued to be weak in the afternoon. As a result, it was only about $1 greater. Returning to the Fanwei Qixi No. 2 in the early market in April and May was $50, and only $49.50 in the afternoon. The current delivery opened at $46.50. The total transaction volume was 300 tons for futures and 6,000 bags for spot goods.</p>
<h3>Wheat Flour Is Slightly Tight</h3>
<p>Wheat flour is slightly tight, probably because the European war has expanded, gold has soared, and rice prices have risen, so people's hearts are tight. However, customers are slightly sluggish, and it is difficult for the market to develop. The Kaiyuan powder station is firm and unmoving. Laoche recalled that the initial asking price of the powder was similar to the Kaiyuan station. It once expanded and held in the morning. It was heard that the market price was 13.40 yuan, but there was no actual transaction. Only inland powder had some purchases from local customers, with a total of Shuangshi brand at 13.90 yuan and Shanlu brand at 12.85 yuan, slightly higher than before. It was also heard that the foreign fort station opened at 13.70 yuan, and a total of about 10,000 bags were traded.</p>
<p>The wheat market transaction was quite quiet, because it was widely rumored that a large batch of foreign wheat would arrive, and people's hearts were quite loose. Now that the European war situation is serious, the source of foreign wheat may be blocked, and the fixed wheat contract price is especially high, so those who hold the goods have a strong desire to sell again. However, Chinese factories have a lack of interest, and the market is rarely developed. As a result, the factory handled 5-600 bags of Suzhou wheat, and the price stood at the original price of $22.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Crude Oil Continues to Rise by More Than One Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation of soybean oil and peanut oil was still separate. Under the continued interest of the Hong Kong merchants in peanut oil, the interest of merchants and hoarders was even better, and the market price continued to rise by 1.5 yuan. Soybean oil sales were dull and lacked the ability to develop. According to the statistics of the unified market, Dalian soybean oil was opened at 150 barrels, with a price of 105 yuan. Midway, it was 104.5 yuan, and then it returned to 105 yuan. The closing price was 105.20 yuan. Dayou Factory's soybean oil was traded at 100 dan, with a price of 81.50 yuan. Peanut oil was opened at 400 pieces of Guangzhou oil, with a price of 74.50 yuan. Qingdao oil was 300 barrels, with a price of 105-106 yuan. Jiangbei canned oil was 400 cans, with a price of 101 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal: White Coal Price Increase</h3>
<p>Coal Balls Also Raise Prices</p>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, the source of Hongji White Coal has become increasingly scarce, and because various factories have renovated their stoves, the destination has become more prosperous, resulting in an imbalance between supply and demand, and prices have risen steadily. Yesterday, the Hongji White Coal industry association continued to rise by $5, to $170 per ton. Hongji No. 2 dross (coal ball raw material) increased by $8, totaling $118. As a result, the Coal Ball Association held an emergency meeting. From now on, Yitaixing Nanyang Factory prices will uniformly increase by $8, $140 per ton for the gate to send customers, $17.5 per ton, and $7 per dan for retail.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: European War Expands; Japanese and American Silk Prices Rebound; Local Market Also Becomes Active</h3>
<p>Japanese and American silk prices were weak, but both rose sharply yesterday due to the expansion of the European war. Yokohama spot prices rose by $90, and distant-term prices rose by $111. New York near-term prices rose by $0.16, and distant-term prices rose by $0.17. New York China-Japan raw silk spot prices rose by $0.07-$0.08.</p>
<p>The local silk market also became active immediately. Companies such as Jardine Matheson and Da Chang purchased 70 pieces of Baichang silk and 50 pieces of Qili silk. Silk prices all surged by $50 to $150. The silk market, which had been depressed for several weeks, has begun to turn around yesterday.</p>
<h3>Tea Sales Return to Quiet</h3>
<p>The sales of green tea to British and French merchants are all indifferent because European war expands and the future changes are unpredictable. The entire city has only purchased 130 boxes of Chou Xin Zhen Mei green tea and Xi Zhen Mei from Baochang and Ruichang, etc. The selling price of Chou Zhen Mei is $320, and the selling price of Zhen Mei is from $60 to $80. The market price has fallen by $10-$20 compared to before.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse White Rises Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were no changes in the foreign telegrams in the sugar market, but the listing by the local association continued to tighten. The opening price in the morning was especially high. The price of 24 crude white sugar was $64.50 at the local station and $64 for new goods at foreign stations. The closing price returned to $63.70. The price of old goods arriving in June of last year was $63, transit goods were $51, crude red was $52.70, and transit was $44. Taikoo Che Bai and Che red sugar saw further expansion. B west station new goods were $68.70, old goods were $68.50, CW was $68.30, CX was $68.20, DY was $68, and HX was $67.80. Dong station goods were reduced by $0.30, H red was $49.50, Ben Xue Bai was $63.50, Ben Bing was $75.50, and Jingming Bing was $77.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Scarcity of Shan Gualou</h3>
<p>Because the source of Shan Nai has been temporarily cut off, the sales here rely solely on the stock from last winter for support. Currently, it is about to be sold out. Although merchants still have a small number of transactions, the price is as high as $80. It is heard that a certain firm has directly arranged a batch from Shantou and is trying to ship it. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai within a month.</p>
<p>Recently, a batch of Gualou has arrived to meet the appropriate sales order and was sold immediately. It is estimated that the Gualou skin is $155 and the Gualou seeds are $150. However, the quantity of incoming goods is still small, and it seems that the demand is exceeding the supply. The situation is very stable.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Western Sea Cucumbers Are Certainly Expensive; Light Sea Cucumbers Drop Slightly</h3>
<p>A batch of Western sea cucumbers has been opened again, and the prices are quite high. Because the source is scarce, it is difficult to hope for a decline. The bidding price for Cage Teeth is $377, No. 1 is $175, No. 1 is $372, No. 3 is $353, No. 4 is $303, and Small Medium is $278. The bidding price for Chen Xiang selection is $385, No. 1 is $372, No. 2 is $360, No. 3-4 is $325, and Xian Da Gang's bidding price is $312, No. 1 is $296, Da 2 is $305, No. 2 is $302, No. 3 is $288, No. 4 is $256, and Small Medium is $220.</p>
<p>The arrival of Siamese dried mussels is successive, so the bottom stock is sufficient, the destination has turned weak, and the momentum is slightly soft. For example, the opening price yesterday was $182, which was $7-$8 lower than before.</p>
<p>Since the domestic mushrooms have been purchased and sold in Hong Kong, the exchange rate is quite profitable, resulting in high bottom prices. Recently, the demand of the help has been stagnant, and the source of supply from various places here has turned strong, and the market has become increasingly flat. For example, the trading price of Chuzhou Longquan mushrooms, which were opened the day before yesterday, was only $450.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Pumpkin Seeds, Rice Noodles, and Dried Goods – All Increasing in Price Due to Shortages</h3>
<p>White melon seeds are still scarce in origin, and market conditions remain tight. A few days ago, dozens of packages arrived, priced at eighty-five yuan. It is said that they have already been traded, opening at eighty-four yuan, an increase of nine yuan compared to before, indicating a highly profitable batch.</p>
<p>Longkou vermicelli, previously as high as one hundred and thirty yuan due to shortages, is now scarce. Qingdao vermicelli is currently priced at one hundred and ten yuan. However, hot pot vermicelli is softening due to a decrease in demand. For example, Yingshan goods are at seventy-five yuan, and Hekou goods are at sixty-five yuan. Jiangbei goods are temporarily out of stock.</p>
<p>Xian rice flakes, previously priced at nine hundred and fifty yuan due to low stock, were even higher at one thousand yuan. Recently, shipments have also arrived from Ningbo, easing market conditions. Yesterday, the market price was nine hundred yuan, a decrease of one hundred yuan.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, in the love between husband and wife, the husband is in the active, creative position. An enlightened husband not only understands his wife's personality well, but also her physiological characteristics, needs, and changes. He then uses his loving skills to create a work of art of love. Therefore, many girls are very proud in their parents' home, but after marrying a husband, they transform into someone leaning on her husband like a little bird. Some have very luxurious lifestyles before marriage, but after marriage, they suddenly become thrifty housewives. She saves all the love created by her husband and the money earned from work. As a result, she becomes a woman rich in love, and their family becomes a financially prosperous family. What is even more surprising is that the wife's body and mind often change according to the husband's wishes. The thin will become fat, and the weak and ugly will become healthy and beautiful. The beauty of the breasts and the clarity of the curves become more and more obvious after marriage. As for their intelligent and lively children, who are jointly born, they are even more their living treasures. Therefore, it is said that the most satisfactory lover is not naturally made, but artificially made. This sentence has a profound meaning.</p>
<p>Since the husband is the creator of love, he should devote himself to the beautiful creation of your love. Starting from managing the family, governing the country, and bringing peace to the world may not be the wrong path. However, creation requires creative energy. If the husband is truly energetic and strong, the wife and concubines will naturally be more beautiful and affectionate. With more affection between husband and wife, they can naturally create a happy family with ease. If a man has committed masturbation and excessive indulgence in his youth, damaging the endocrine function of his reproductive glands, resulting in nocturnal emission, kidney deficiency, impotence, incomplete development, neurasthenia and other symptoms, then after marriage, he will not be able to comfort his wife's heart, and in marital life he will incur his wife's hatred. How can love arise from this? Even the love that existed before will be destroyed because of this! A couple without love are like nails in each other's eyes during the day and dream different dreams in the same bed at night. What is the pain in their hearts like? Because of pain, they worry, resent, and hate. Even a gentle woman will turn into a shrew, and a physically fit young woman will turn into a resentful woman. Or, due to emotional debates, tragedies such as elopement, suicide, and divorce occur, which are also seen in today's social news from time to time!</p>
<p>Since the husband's energy is so important, if you unfortunately already have the above-mentioned symptoms, you must seek medical treatment as soon as possible. Treatment: According to world-renowned doctors and our experience, taking 'Reproductin', a preparation made from the reproductive gland hormones of healthy animals, is the most effective and specific treatment. This preparation is made from the essence of reproductive gland hormones extracted from the bodies of healthy animals such as lions, tigers, orangutans, bears, deer, and sea dogs, and is made using scientific replication methods, so its quality is precious and its effect is certain, surpassing any similar preparation. Men can produce sperm, nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, and activate blood circulation within one day of taking it. Continuous use for one month can also help growth and nourish nerves. It will definitely cure all symptoms, increase energy. Middle-aged and elderly people who take it regularly will prolong life, rejuvenate themselves. However, those suffering from nocturnal emission must also take 'Hymettus Semen-Stopping Pills' (available in all major pharmacies such as Sino-Western Wuzhou and the Western medicine department of Wing On Company, priced at two yuan per box) to consolidate the sperm gate and stop leakage, so that the effect is even faster.</p>
<p>Beauty</p>
<h3>What is the Impact of Breast Atrophy?</h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>A healthy and beautiful young woman with high breasts, plump hips, a slender waist, and obvious curves is indeed like the darling of society. She is fragrant, sweet, respected, and pursued everywhere. She not only enjoys all kinds of material advantages, but also her body and mind are not the same as those of women with breast atrophy, thin hips, and loss of beauty. According to medical judgments, the reason why the breasts can be high and elastic is entirely due to the healthy function of the ovaries and the vigorous metabolism. The academia is full of new cells. As a result, the characteristics are developed, the complexion is ruddy, the skin is delicate, the thinking is agile, and the temperament is gentle. Even when encountering difficulties, she can make decisive decisions, and even when encountering unwanted things, she can handle them calmly without becoming irritable and angry. With an open mind and a strong will, such women, once married, will have very deep feelings between husband and wife, building happy families and giving birth to virtuous wives and loving mothers. However, women with breast atrophy, thin hips, and loss of beauty not only do not have this happiness, but also suffer from many diseases and pains, experiencing the misery of the world! The only way to remedy it. According to Chinese and Western doctors and our experience, only taking the female "Reproductin," a reproductive gland ovarian hormone preparation, is the most effective and specific treatment. This preparation was invented by Dr. Steiner, a world-renowned master of physiology, after more than thirty years of hard work and experimentation. In addition to collecting ovarian glands, liver paste, and pituitary glands from young animals, it also contains minerals and plants, iron, manganese, and multiple vitamins, and is meticulously produced under the most perfect scientific equipment, so the medicinal properties are very peaceful, and the medicinal power is completely preserved, and there are no side effects. It can be taken regularly regardless of the cold or heat. If you take it in the booming season of spring, it can be twice as effective, making the atrophied breasts appear high in a short period of time, relieving various diseases in the body, promoting metabolism. Ruddy cheeks, enhance beauty.</p>
<h3>The Tragedy of Nocturnal Emission Youths After the Warm Spring</h3>
<p>— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>"The weather is getting warmer and the days are getting longer because of people." The warm spring weather is most likely to make people sleepy! Especially for young people with nocturnal emission, because of the loss of energy, after the warm spring, they often feel dizzy, have poor memory, and dull thinking. The schoolwork is difficult to improve; if they work in the industry, they often feel sore back and pain in the waist after a little hard work and cannot be competent. If they are already married, they often have early decline in energy and impotence in marital life, or because of long-term nocturnal emission, it leads to incomplete development and early decline in energy, and they cannot be human beings at all, then isn't youth happiness also cut off? Therefore, young people with nocturnal emission must make decisive decisions and make a plan for a radical cure as soon as possible. If they delay, the energy will gradually be lost, and the tragedy after the warm spring is unimaginable!</p>
<p>Why does a man's semen, which is well hidden in the seminal vesicles, leak out involuntarily? According to medical judgment, it is mostly because of masturbation and excessive indulgence in his early years, which damaged the sexual nerves and loosened the sperm gate. Therefore, to fundamentally cure nocturnal emission, it is also necessary to consolidate the sperm gate as the best strategy. 'Hymettus Semen-Stopping Pills', a famous German special medicine for curing nocturnal emission, fully possesses this effect. Patients should swallow three pills with boiled water before going to bed, which has the special effects of calming the mind, nourishing the nerves, consolidating the sperm gate, and radically curing nocturnal emission that night. If the above-mentioned symptoms have already occurred due to nocturnal emission, it is necessary to also take 'Reproductin', a preparation of healthy animal reproductive gland hormones, to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, nourish the nerves, and promote development. If you can continue to take it continuously, you will definitely cure all symptoms in a short period of time, making your energy abundant and your mind clear. If you are a young person with energy, thought, and ability, then how can the future be limited! If patients, for the sake of prudence, can personally come to our clinic to also apply new techniques such as electrotherapy and injection, it can be guaranteed to be cured.</p>

<h3>Unintentionally Turning into Chronic Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>In the initial acute symptoms, chronic gonorrhea often develops unconsciously. According to the results of my many years of experience, in addition to gonococci, there are also many other bacteria mixed in, especially those caused by bacilli are the most common. The patient's self-consciousness is a feeling of discomfort and itching in the urethra, or a slight pain, and only then does he ask the doctor for diagnosis and treatment. However, due to the mild symptoms, the patient neglects treatment and health care, so unconsciously, the gonococci invade the posterior urethra from the anterior urethra, causing prostatitis, seminal vesiculitis, orchitis, cystitis, and systemic infectious arthritis, and only then does he know that his disease has not only not been cured, but has become worse.</p>
<p>Sometimes, in such symptoms, the urine is not completely turbid, and it is mostly transparent or slightly lymphatic. However, in fact, such venues are often unintentionally transmitted to the opposite sex, so husbands who already have wives should pay attention to the symptoms of such chronic gonorrhea and seek immediate cure. Whenever you encounter such symptoms, you must use urine culture, repeated examination, or prostatic massage to examine the liquid that is drained under a microscope, and you will be able to find gonococci and other bacilli to determine the location of gonorrhea, and then treat according to the symptoms. In terms of treatment methods, German Filtrin current therapy is the first choice, because the conductor is inserted into the inside of the urethra, and then the degree of electricity is opened according to the severity of the disease, so that the bactericidal power is directly projected onto the lesion, just right. German Heiss serum is also selected to resist gonorrhea, kill bacteria, and immunize. Other methods such as washing, massage, cooling, and hot bath can be applied according to the symptoms. Then, chronic gonorrhea with such symptoms can be cured radically in four or five weeks. It also treats syphilis, hemorrhoids, and removes the foreskin with a painless new method.</p>

<h3>Today's Board Election Results - A Glimpse into the Future Fate of the Concession - More Than 5,000 Votes Cast at Two Locations Yesterday - British and American Candidates Already Had an Advantage Yesterday - One of the Most Tense Pages in the History of the Concession</h3>
<p>This year's Municipal Council board election, one of the most tense scenes in the seventy-year history of the Public Concession, unfolded yesterday. The voting was divided into two locations: one was in the drill hall of the Youguo Merchants Group on Fuzhou Road, and the other was in the Hongkou small market. From yesterday morning until 2 pm today, nine people will be elected from the thirteen candidates: (1) Alerman, (2) Benar, (3) Tian Cheng, (4) Hai Lai, (5) Hanxiong Taro, (6) Kai Ziwei, (7) Kuroda Keitaro, (8) Rotlik McDonald, (9) Renault McDonald, (10) Mitchell, (11) Okamoto Kazusaku, (12) Okamoto Otsuichi, (13) Powell, etc. The British and American side, seeing the Japanese side's attempt to seize administrative power of the concession, suddenly increased the number of candidates to five. Knowing its intentions, in order to maintain the status quo of the concession and safeguard the rights and interests that the British and American side have in the concession, they formed a micro-united front and took consistent steps to fully deal with the Japanese side. Other taxpayers from various countries in Shanghai, initially confused by the Japanese side's sweet words and dissatisfied with the current financial and administrative measures of the Municipal Council, a small number of taxpayers tended to support Japanese taxpayers. However, the majority of those who understood the righteousness, carefully considered the pros and cons, and weighed the pros and cons, were intimidated by the Japanese side's precedent of excluding the rights and interests of third countries in the occupied areas. In addition, with the British and American side's repeated calls, the entire situation has already changed. At this time, we cannot predict the election results, which side will ultimately win. But for the sake of justice and fairness, for the safety of Shanghai residents, we certainly do not want the fate of the French Concession in Hankou, the British Concession in Tianjin, and the public concession in Xiamen to come to the sea. Here is a detailed account of yesterday's tense situation,</p>
<p>The Number of Votes at Both Locations is Similar</p>
<p>Shanghai Xiqiao taxpayers began voting yesterday. According to reports from the ballot collection offices at the drill field of the International Business Corps and the Hongkou small market, as of 3 pm, the two locations had collected a total of more than 5,000 votes. According to eyewitnesses, the biggest difficulty at the ballot collection office was excessive crowding. Before voting, each taxpayer with a red scarf had to check whether their name had been registered. Those responsible for checking checked according to the first letter of their names. Yesterday, only two people were responsible for checking the letters A "B" "C". They were too busy, so it took a very long time to put the election tickets into the box. However, the two people who were responsible for checking the letters "X" "Y" "Z" were very free and easy to cope with, and the voting process was also quite fast. According to the report of the ballot collection office in the drill hall of the International Business Corps, a total of 3,000 votes were collected there. According to news from the American side, as of yesterday, there were few American taxpayers who had not voted. The American Association will continue to persuade taxpayers not to give up their rights today. The number of British voters is also large, and there should be more today than yesterday. Therefore, according to general speculation, the voting situation today will be even more tense. By 3 pm today, a total of more than 10,000 votes should be collected.</p>
<p>Jews in Hongkou are Stubborn</p>
<p>According to the report of the voting office in the Hongkou small market, as of 3 pm yesterday, a total of 2,500 votes were collected. Among them, about 2,200 votes were cast by Japanese taxpayers, and about 300 votes were cast by Jewish refugees and Jewish residents. It is said that at 9:20 am yesterday, forty minutes before the voting started, there were more than 200 Japanese residents waiting at the door of the Hongkou ballot collection office. By 10 am, the number had increased to more than 600. After the voting started, they flocked in, with Japanese women and Westerners mixed among them. The order was good throughout the day. Only one person lost his admission certificate and asked for a replacement. At the same time, pro-Japanese Jews posted slogans in various parts of Hongkou, saying, "Don't forget that we live in Hongkou," as a reason to support Japanese candidates. It is learned that several Jews were working in the election committee office of the Japanese side on Zhaofeng Road yesterday, and they were very busy. It is said that more than 250 Jews have been attracted to Qiaobei by them to vote in favor of Japanese candidates. They delusional that the Japanese would help their relatives and friends escape the European fire pit and come to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Japanese Extravagance Cannot be Realized</p>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News said that the voting for the next board of directors of the Municipal Council began this morning (the 11th). A large number of taxpayers went to the two voting sites in the drill hall of the business group in the Municipal Council Building and the Hongkou vegetable market to vote. There was an endless stream of people all day long. The British, American, and Japanese expatriate election committees urged their expatriates to participate in the voting. The work was busy and unprecedented. According to well-informed sources, British and American candidates should get the majority of votes. The Japanese hope to exclude three British and American candidates, which is like trying to catch the moon in the water.</p>
<p>Japanese Taxpayers Arrived Earliest</p>
<p>The first to arrive at the Municipal Council Building to vote were Japanese taxpayers, and their number was very large, so other expatriates who arrived later had to wait behind and enter in turn after a long wait. In front of the voting site, there was a team of inspectors sent by the Japanese side, carefully counting the number of people entering the venue and recording the number in a notebook. Outside, there were also four plainclothes Japanese. At the entrance of the Hongkou vegetable market voting site, there was a special information desk set up by the Japanese side. This was pre-authorized.</p>
<p>The Voting Arrangement is Very Careful</p>
<p>In view of the large number of voters this year, the Municipal Council has made proper arrangements in advance, such as adding voting booths and increasing the number of ticket distribution tables in the two voting sites, and classifying them. To enter the voting site, you must show your voting certificate, and after checking that it is correct, you can receive the election ticket, fill it out and put it into the ballot box.</p>
<p>Both Locations Have Special Personnel to Take Care of Them</p>
<p>The person in charge of the voting site in the Municipal Council Building is Middleton, the deputy director of the finance department. The person in charge of managing the Hongkou vegetable market is Comolli of the tax office. Each has many assistants to help take care of it. The advertisements published in various newspapers today instructed taxpayers not to elect the independent British candidate Renault McDonald. McDonald ordered people to distribute leaflets at the voting site, asking people to vote for "British independent candidate Renault McDonald, No. 9".</p>
<p>The Last Activities of the British and American Side</p>
<p>The American Election Committee specially installed six telephone lines in the American General Assembly and notified all taxpayers in the United States by telephone this morning to vote as soon as possible. The British Election Committee has been active for more than a month, and today is the most active. It is expected that the number of British taxpayers participating in the voting will be much higher than usual. For the convenience of British and American taxpayers, the two committees specially sent vehicles to pick up and drop off expatriates to vote.</p>
<p>Voting Booths and Tables Added Today</p>
<p>The Municipal Council, because the Japanese suddenly increased the number of candidates to as many as five, and boasted that they could get the support of the majority of taxpayers, the British and American expatriates also believed that they could not maintain their rights and interests if they did not strive for victory, so they carried out large-scale activities, and voters must be enthusiastic, causing the polling stations set up to be extremely crowded. In order to meet the needs, it was decided to add a number of polling stations at the Hongkou small market and the drill hall of the International Business Corps today, in the hope of completing the voting within two days.</p>
<p>The Civilian Register Compiled by the Japanese Has Not Been Rechecked</p>
<p>The Municipal Council was concerned that the election register created by the Japanese side might have fraudulent situations, so the tax collection department sent personnel to recheck it to clarify whether all indirect taxpayers met the qualifications of electors. However, due to the short time, the investigation work was not widespread. In order to avoid conflicts with the Japanese side, election certificates were specially issued according to the register for those who had not been rechecked.</p>
<p>Lin Xionggi and Others Stayed Up Several Nights</p>
<p>In order to achieve electoral victory and manipulate the administration of the concession, the Japanese side worked desperately in organization and propaganda. Lin Xionggi and other election committee members therefore stayed up several nights. In the Hongkou area the day before yesterday, leaflets and slogans posted by the Japanese election committee could be seen everywhere, encouraging Japanese people with the right to vote, "Don't give up your valuable vote", "Elect Japanese candidates", "Don't forget to sign on the election ticket". The Continental News yesterday even used the headline "Arrest and Establish a New Order in Shanghai" as the first news item, advocating "implementing the principles of the East Asian New Order in Shanghai with the victory of the election battle". Lin Xionggi also issued a statement on the evening of the 9th, saying that maintaining the status quo, although once supported by the world, but the situation has changed, this concept is difficult to exist. The Japanese must break the status quo of the Shanghai concession and build a "new order". This election battle is the first step in breaking the status quo. Although it is difficult to foresee the outcome of this battle, the Japanese must devote all their efforts to implement the proposition they hold for the Shanghai concession." From this point of view, the Japanese side's ambition to monopolize the rights and interests of Shanghai and eliminate the position of European and American countries in Shanghai has reached the point of extreme urgency and cannot be concealed. In order to have an excuse after the failure of the election, and to make it difficult for the Municipal Council, the Japanese side created various news on the Japanese newspapers yesterday, attacking the Municipal Council, saying that in many Jewish coffee shops, British police officers sent by the Municipal Council were demonstrating and persuading Jewish electors, and British police officers were visiting Jewish people door to door to promote and instruct them to vote for British and American candidates.</p>
<p>The Speaker of the Japanese Side - The Implied Meaning</p>
<p>The speaker of the Japanese Embassy claimed at a reception for news reporters yesterday that the publicity of the British and American side on this election was almost completely ineffective. It is claimed that the reason held by the British and American side is nothing more than that the Japanese side is trying to control the concession and exclude the rights and interests of the British and American side in China. They even hinted that the order of the concession will be greatly disrupted as a result, but no matter what the result of the election, he believes that the concession should absolutely maintain internationalization," and the Japanese can occupy a better position in the Municipal Council, and also said that what the Japanese side hopes is to gradually improve the administration of the concession and become completely internationalized. The speaker also declared that at present, the Japanese side has formed a committee composed of a British, a Dutch, a Chinese, and a Japanese to study the issue of how to make the concession internationalized, and expressed the willingness of other expatriates to also participate in this committee. Finally, the speaker also believes that the result of this election is either all five Japanese candidates will be elected or all will be defeated.</p>
<h3>Western Press Pays Close Attention: The Results of This Election Expose All of the Japanese Inner Conspiracies - Do Not Let Shanghai Suffer the Fate of Tianjin</h3>
<p>The tense situation of the Shanghai Municipal Council’s current board election can be seen in the records of Japanese and Western newspapers. Yesterday, in addition to prominent headlines like “Election Begins,” Western newspapers such as the North-China Daily News also published a large advertisement on the front page showing the style of the ballot. To the left of the names of the British and American candidates, they attached an "X" mark, instructing taxpayers to take united action. Under the names of candidates Reynold MacDonald and the Japanese candidates, they wrote the words "Leave it blank" in large characters and indicated the blank space with arrows. The fifth page of the China Press published a larger advertisement than the North-China Daily News, taking up nearly half the page, with the words "The American Association asks every registered voter to vote early in support of the seven British and American candidates." The Shanghai Times had a long commentary on the matter. The editorial of the China Press was even more active and was placed before the European war commentary, showing how much the British and Americans valued this election.</p>
<p>Shanghai's Future Hinges on Today</p>
<p>The China Press published an editorial yesterday titled "Shanghai at the Crossroads," stating roughly that the future of the Shanghai International Settlement is now in the hands of the city's voters. Whether they will vote today to determine the status quo of the Municipal Council will be seen in the election results. The most important question in these next two days is whether the international status of the Public Concession will be preserved or controlled by the Japanese, turning the city into a Japanese imperial outpost. As for the wasteful policies and administrative efficiency of the Municipal Council, these issues are not part of the election platform. If the financial and administrative policies of the Municipal Council need to be reformed, it must be delayed until the threat to the safety of the Public Concession is eliminated. It is not difficult to see that the fundamental purpose of the Japanese using the election method to gain control of the Public Concession. Japanese candidates and official spokesmen have said that the Japanese goal is to modernize the Public Concession and make it an economical administrative organ. This is deceitful talk. It should be known that the Japanese have nominated five candidates, and if their goal is reform, then there is an irrefutable fact that can be used as evidence: the Japanese should first vigorously reorganize the area outside the Shanghai-West border roads. That area needs a fair and effective administrative organ far more urgently than the Public Concession itself. The Japanese have not shown their ability or intention to cultivate a fair and effective administrative organ in the occupied cities of China and the suburbs of Shanghai. This shows that if the Japanese take over the Municipal Council, they will not be able to establish a more effective and fair administrative system in the Public Concession. The Japanese so-called goal of reform is nothing more than campaign rhetoric. Their sole purpose is to place this international city under the military, economic, and political control of their country. This can be stated with certainty.</p>
<p>Westerners Reveal Japanese Ambitions</p>
<p>(1) A Western taxpayer sent a letter to the North-China Daily News yesterday, strongly criticizing the Japanese ambition to control the concession. It stated: "Some people think that after the Japanese control the administration of the concession, the situation will not deteriorate further, and may even improve the status quo. In fact, this is completely wrong. After the concession is controlled by the Japanese, we can take Hongkou and Nanshi as a warning. Today, Hongkou and Nanshi are still barren lands. This is not because the rising living standards of the citizens make it difficult to restore the old appearance, but it is enough to prove what the power of the Japanese is like. Or it is said that the Japanese control of Hongkou and Nanshi is a military action, not a political one, so it is very difficult to restore the area to its original state. This statement is reasonable to a certain extent, but if we compare it with the situation in the areas beyond the boundaries, such as the Japanese arbitrarily arresting a certain Russian woman in Hongkou, disturbing the American commercial radio station, and the Japanese army's continued blockade of the Yangtze River and the Pearl River, Westerners cannot sympathize with the Japanese. Therefore, any Westerner who does not recognize the goal and votes for Japanese candidates in this election will be to blame once the concession is controlled by the Japanese army, and will inevitably suffer the consequences." The letter also strongly attacked the participation of independent candidate Reynold MacDonald. It shouted loudly and appealed to Western taxpayers to vote for the seven British and American candidates, fearing that Reynold MacDonald would disperse the votes of the seven, causing the Japanese to succeed by chance. This matter is of great importance, so it called on Western taxpayers to pay close attention. The letter also included a table estimating the number of votes that each side could get, believing that if 4,000 Western taxpayers voted for the five British candidates, they would get 20,000 votes, with each person getting an average of 4,000 votes, which would be enough to exceed the 3,700 votes that each Japanese candidate could get. If MacDonald is also included, then the number of British candidates would increase to six, and with six people dividing 20,000 votes, each person would only get about 3,333 votes. This number is obviously not able to compete with the Japanese.</p>
<p>Portuguese Support British and Americans</p>
<p>(2) In addition, a Portuguese taxpayer also sent a letter to the North-China Daily News yesterday, stating that he believes that the Portuguese should all vote for the British and American candidates to maintain the original state of the concession. He believes that the Portuguese in Shanghai and Hong Kong have been cooperating with the British and American side for half a century and have obtained their living conditions, so the Portuguese should be absolutely grateful to the British and American expatriates and hope to maintain the status quo. He continued to say that although they have no ill feelings towards the Japanese, they all want the administration of the concession to be maintained by British and American expatriates.</p>
<p>The Last Move in the Japanese Conspiracy</p>
<p>The China Critic Weekly published today stated that the Japanese statement that they will return the police power of Hongkou to the Municipal Council is just a trick by the Japanese to seize the administrative power of the concession. The Japanese can use this to break the traditional view that Hongkou is a "special situation" and allow every Japanese taxpayer, even those living in the Hongkou area, to have the opportunity to vote for Japanese candidates. The article believes that this move is actually the last move by the Japanese to seize the administration of the concession, but it will undoubtedly fail because the United States has taken an absolutely tough stance against it. If the American expatriates do not care about the administrative management power of the Municipal Council, then the Shanghai Concession will inevitably suffer the same fate as the Tianjin Concession. The article also believes that this move by the Japanese is a new posture under their consistent ambition for the concession.</p>
<h3>Two Assassinations Occurred Yesterday: Liu Fuxie and Huang Youfen Both Died - The Police Are Investigating the Reasons for the Attacks</h3>
<p>Two assassinations occurred in the city yesterday, and both people died. The first occurred at 12:11 pm yesterday, and the deceased was Liu Fuxie, the deputy supervisor of the Public Works Bureau, who was shot at the corner of Chengdu Road and Weihaiwei Road. The second occurred at about 5:30 pm yesterday on Hualong Road in the French Concession, and the deceased was Huang Youfen, a former police officer of the Public Security Bureau. The details of the two cases are described below:</p>
<p>Liu Fuxie</p>
<p>A shooting occurred at the corner of Chengdu Road and Weihaiwei Road in the Public Concession at about 12:11 pm yesterday. The victim was Liu Fuxie, the deputy supervisor of the Public Works Bureau, who was shot three times in the head and died on the spot. The assailant abandoned his weapon and fled without a trace. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Deputy Supervisor</p>
<p>Liu Fuxie was from Bao'an, Guangdong, and was 47 years old. He was tall and dignified. His wife, Ling, was 45 years old. He had three sons, all of whom were students. He lived in a small Western-style house at No. 21, Jinde Lane, No. 183 Chengdu Road. He had been the deputy supervisor of the Public Works Bureau on the Bund for ten years. He was previously assigned to work in the machine room of the Public Works Bureau in Zhanghuabang, Wusong. After the war, he was transferred back to the general bureau and assigned to work on the dredger at the Swire Dock. He had a very high monthly income and lived a prosperous life. Yesterday at about 12:00 pm, Liu was wearing a beige Western-style suit, gray flannel trousers, a wool vest, a white broadcloth shirt, a beige spring overcoat, yellow leather shoes, and a dark gray felt hat. After finishing his work at the bureau, he took the No. 14 bus on the Bund to return home for lunch.</p>
<p>Shot Three Times</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, when the bus arrived at the corner of Chengdu Road and Weihaiwei Road, and before he had taken a few steps after getting off, an assailant armed with a gun, who had been lying in wait there, saw Liu approaching and immediately pulled out his gun and fired several shots at Liu's head. He was shot three times, once below Liu's right ear and twice in the back of his neck. The bullets did not pass through. He immediately fell to the ground, and blood splattered everywhere. Seeing that his purpose had been achieved, the assailant abandoned his weapon on the road in front of No. 200 Chengdu Road and fled without a trace. At this time, pedestrians surrounded and watched, and the road was blocked. The Chengdu Road Police Station was nearby. Chinese and Western detectives heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, but the shooter had already fled far away. They only found a pistol and four empty cartridges discarded by the murderer on the road nearby and took them back to the police station for investigation. At the same time, they urgently summoned ambulance No. 83 and rushed Liu Fuxie, who had been injured, to Baolong Hospital for treatment. However, the injuries were too severe, and he had lost too much blood. He had already died on the way. At about 5:00 pm, the body was transferred from the hospital to the morgue to report to the court for examination. It was later learned that his eldest son, Weizhang, was studying at the Nantong Textile School, his second son, Zhuoyu, and his youngest son, Zhuoqiu, were both studying at Shanghai University. The house at No. 21 Jinde Lane was Liu's sole residence, and the interior was elegantly decorated. According to his relatives, Liu rarely socialized with the outside world except for work. His sudden assassination is really inexplicable. The police are paying great attention to this case and are investigating it. It is said that it may be related to politics.</p>
<p>Huang Youfen</p>
<p>A shooting occurred in front of the Jinjiang Tea House on Hualong Road in the French Concession at about 5:30 pm yesterday. The victim was a Sichuanese man named Huang Youfen, who was shot three times and seriously injured. He died before he could be treated. The assailant was arrested on the spot. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Died from Three Shots</p>
<p>Huang Youfen was a Sichuanese man, 38 years old, who lived in a pavilion room on the second floor of No. 72 Tianzhutang Street in the French Concession, paying a monthly rent of 12 yuan for about three months. He was formerly a police officer in the Third District Branch of the Public Security Bureau. At about 5:30 pm yesterday, Huang, wearing a dark blue serge Zhongshan suit, was walking from north to south on Hualong Road in front of the Jinjiang Tea House at No. 70, when a person following him from behind, also wearing a black Zhongshan suit, pulled out a gun and shot him. He fired four shots, three of which hit him. One shot hit him in the chest, one in the abdomen, and one in the left waist. He was injured and fell to the ground, and blood splattered everywhere. Seeing that his purpose had been achieved, the assailant threw a red paper strip with the words "Ordered to carry out the execution" written on it beside him, and then fled to Gujia Lane across from Hualong Primary School.</p>
<p>The Murderer Was Captured</p>
<p>At that time, the two patrol officers of Hualong Primary School blew their whistles and followed closely behind. When crossing Luban Road and turning south onto Wangzhi Road and Malang Road, the assailant tried to call a streetcar to escape. At this time, the nearby patrol officers heard the alarm and arrived on the scene and arrested him on the spot. At the same time, they urgently summoned an ambulance and sent the victim to Guangci Hospital for treatment. They also found a pistol discarded by the murderer in Gujia Lane and immediately took it to the Lujiawan General Police Station. Under the preliminary interrogation by the police, he confessed that his surname was Lin, a local, and he admitted that he shot and assassinated Huang Youfen without denying it. Huang Youfen, who was injured, was sent to the hospital, but because the injuries were in vital parts, he died before he could be treated. The police sent the body to the morgue of the Industrial Bureau Hospital on Delastre Road, waiting for the court to send someone to examine the body today. The police are currently investigating the murderer's address, occupation, place of origin, and the reason for the victim's death.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Authorities Cable Shanghai to Discuss Foreign Vessels Handling Their Own Lighterage</h3>
<p>The wartime Ningbo Shipping Administration of Zhejiang Province, based on a telegram from the Sanbei Company, intends to change to each vessel hiring its own lighters to prevent theft and leakage. Yesterday, they telegraphed the Shipping Industry Association to convene shippers as soon as possible to discuss and report. The order is recorded as follows: According to the telegram from Yu Qiaqing, manager of the Shanghai Sanbei Shipping Company, the Ningbo Lighterage Company was originally organized jointly by shippers, but because it has not been able to perform its duties properly, the fees are high, the management is poor, and there is theft and leakage along the way. Customers have negotiated, but no evidence is provided, and the losses are huge. Since the approval of shallow-water vessels to sail directly, passengers and goods can be directly loaded and unloaded at the Ningbo wharf, saving time and money, and reducing theft and accidental losses. As a result, passengers and goods are all loaded on direct-sailing vessels, and the business of large vessels outside the port has plummeted. The crux of the problem is the poor lighterage. Therefore, we respectfully request your approval to allow our company's vessels outside the port to hire their own lighters freely and handle the lighterage matters, without being restricted by the Ningbo Lighterage Company's patent, in order to maintain business and protect customers' losses. We are at your service, etc. The Ningbo Lighterage Company's poor management is indeed the case. Please convene all shippers as soon as possible to discuss and report for verification. Zhang Guiling, mid-afternoon secret.</p>
<h3>Danish and Norwegian Expatriates in Shanghai Are Concerned About the Turmoil in Their Homeland: The Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish Consulates Have Not Yet Received Any Instructions from Their Governments</h3>
<p>According to foreign sources, since the news that Germany controlled Denmark and advanced into Norway, expatriates from the Scandinavian countries in the city have adopted a "wait and see" attitude towards the threat to their homeland. Telecommunications between Norway and Denmark and the Norwegian and Danish consulates in the city have been completely cut off. Only Sweden can still communicate. The consulates of the three countries jointly stated yesterday that because they have not received government instructions, they will all deal with it calmly. The consulates have not given any instructions to their expatriates in Shanghai, because they cannot take any measures on their own without government instructions. Due to the isolation of information, the consulates have also been unable to make any inferences about the development of the situation. The consulates declared that what they can know is the same as what is published in the city's newspapers. Currently, expatriates from the Scandinavian countries in the city are working hard to obtain more detailed reports and are waiting with great enthusiasm to see if they will be called up for military service. As for the shipping companies operated by Scandinavian merchants in the city, it was stated yesterday that they will continue to operate as usual until they receive any definite news.</p>
<h3>Huangpu Dredging Resumed Yesterday: Work Started Along the East Bank of Waibaidu Bridge</h3>
<p>The Huangpu dredging work, which has been suspended for nearly two years, has reportedly been resumed by the Jianghai Customs Dredging Bureau at 8:00 am on the 10th. The dredging work started from the east of the Waibaidu Bridge, near the former China Merchants Steam Navigation Company warehouse. It is said that the dredger has now been repaired, and after the concession is dredged this year, the floods in the rainy season and yellow tide season may be avoided.</p>
<h3>Forty Million Aluminum Subsidiary Coins Were Minted: The First Batch of Ten Million Coins Was Issued Yesterday - The Saying That the Fractional Currency Notes Will Be Temporarily Suspended Is Not True</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association has been approved by the Ministry of Finance to issue aluminum subsidiary coins of 1-fen and 5-fen to relieve the shortage of fractional currency in the Shanghai market. After the minting began, the first batch of ten million coins arrived in Shanghai and were issued yesterday, circulating in the market. The second batch is about to arrive in Shanghai and will continue to be issued. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Issued Yesterday and Circulating in the Market</p>
<p>The first batch of aluminum subsidiary coins approved by the Ministry of Finance to be minted, totaling ten million coins, worth 300,000 legal currency, including 5 million 1-fen coins, worth 50,000 yuan, and 5 million 5-fen coins, worth 250,000 yuan, arrived in Shanghai and were handed over to the Shanghai Banking Association for issuance. The association stipulated: (1) Member banks of the Banking Association will be distributed by the Banking Joint Reserve Committee; (2) Member banks of the Money Industry Association will be distributed by the Money Industry Joint Reserve; (3) Foreign commercial banks will be distributed by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. It has already started issuing and circulating in the market from 2:00 pm yesterday.</p>
<p>Each Bank Received Coins: Exquisite Style</p>
<p>The Banking Association's issuance of aluminum subsidiary coins stipulated that the four major banks, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the Central Bank of China, were each allowed to receive 10,000 yuan, and other banks and money houses were allowed to receive from 500 yuan to 2,000 yuan, depending on the business of each bank. The aluminum subsidiary coins are small and exquisite. Because of their light weight, they are very convenient to carry. The style of the 1-fen coin has the words "Republic of China Twenty-ninth Year" and "1 Fen" on the front, and a model of an ancient coin on the back. The 5-fen coin also has the words "Republic of China Twenty-ninth Year" and "5 Fen" on the front, and a model of an ancient coin on the back. Both the 1-fen and 5-fen coins have a circular border on the front and back.</p>
<p>The Second Batch Is About to Arrive: Continuous Issuance</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the banking industry yesterday that the second batch of aluminum subsidiary coins, also totaling ten million coins, half 1-fen and half 5-fen, has been minted and will be shipped to Shanghai soon for the Banking Association to continue issuing. It is said that the third and fourth batches are being rushed to mint. Once they are minted, they will be shipped to Shanghai for issuance. The total is 40 million coins, shipped to Shanghai in four batches. Whether to continue minting after this will depend on the needs of the market in the future. It is also said that various industries have requested to receive the coins, and the Banking Association is currently considering it, but the first batch is specifically issued to the banks and money houses for redistribution and circulation.</p>
<p>The Decision to Continue Issuing Fractional Currency Notes</p>
<p>Regarding the 1-fen and 5-fen fractional currency notes previously issued by the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank, 2.5 million legal currency has already been issued. It has now been decided to continue issuing them as needed by the market. The saying that the fractional currency notes will be temporarily suspended after the issuance of the aluminum subsidiary coins has been confirmed by a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency to be untrue. The fractional currency notes and the aluminum subsidiary coins are both fully backed by legal currency, without any discount, and are used in the same way. After this, the shortage of subsidiary coins in the Shanghai market will be completely eliminated, and there will be no more shortage.</p>
<p>The Composition and Weight of the New Subsidiary Coins</p>
<p>Article 2 of the Revised Subsidiary Coin Regulations was promulgated on February 13, 1940. It stipulates the types of subsidiary coins as follows: 10-fen subsidiary coin, total weight 3 grams, composition: nickel 18, copper 55, zinc 27; 5-fen subsidiary coin, total weight 2 grams, composition: nickel 18, copper 55, zinc 27; 2-fen subsidiary coin, total weight 2 grams, composition: copper 65, zinc 35; 1-fen subsidiary coin, total weight 1.5 grams, composition: copper 65, zinc 35.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Opening of the Appeal in the Parricide Case: Zhou Qinxiang Admits to Acting Alone, Zhou Qinji Retracts Confession, Denies Participation in Murder, Questions Raised About Their Ages, Mother Wrongfully Accused, Dissatisfaction with Forensic Report, Request for Re-examination</h3>
<p>The case of Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang, two brothers from Ningbo, who killed their biological father, Zhou Yongjie, at No. 228 Meg Road, West Shanghai, on December 5th of last year, and then dismembered the body with their biological mother, Zhou Jing, using strong acid to dissolve it in an attempt to destroy the evidence, which was reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station by the deceased's eldest daughter, Zhou Qinzhu, leading to the arrest of the mother and two sons and their transfer to the First Special Court, where the two unfilial sons were sentenced to death for murdering their parent, and Zhou Hong was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment for assisting in the dismemberment of the body, details of which were previously published in this newspaper, the three defendants, dissatisfied with the verdict, separately engaged Yang Zunzhi, Ye Shaoying, and Jiang Pingfan as lawyers to appeal to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court.</p>
<p>They argued that the two unfilial sons suffered from hereditary mental impairments. Therefore, the High Court first ordered the forensic doctors of the First Special Court to conduct a complete examination of the two unfilial sons. The forensic doctors prepared a report and submitted it to the High Court. Consequently, the presiding judge scheduled a hearing for yesterday afternoon. Currently, all civil and criminal cases of the Second Branch of the High Court are heard at the temporary court address on Weihaiwei Road and Chongqing Road. However, due to the gravity of this case, the number of attendees at the hearing was expected to be high. Given the limited space at that location, it was decided to temporarily use the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court on North Zhejiang Road for the trial. The hundred or so attendance tickets that were issued were quickly claimed. Therefore, by around 2:00 PM yesterday, the Second Criminal Court was packed, and a significant number of people without tickets were denied entry. At 2:40 PM, presiding Judge Nie Cheyi, along with associate Judges Shi Meiyu and Mai Zhensheng, Prosecutor Lin Wopeng, and the clerk,</p>
<p>took their seats to open the court.</p>
<p>The three appellants were first brought to the case. The Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang brothers wore the same gray long robes they wore when arrested last year, but they looked haggard. Zhou Jing wore a female prisoner's uniform with the number 390 pinned to the front. When Judge Nie first asked the three appellants about their ages, Qinji and Qinxiang suddenly changed the ages they had given during the first trial, from twenty-four and twenty-one years old respectively. Qinji now claimed to be twenty-one years old, and Qinxiang claimed to be only eighteen years old. To be cautious, Judge Nie adopted a separate interrogation approach. After ordering the three appellants to be temporarily detained, he first questioned Chen Renji, a witness for Zhou Jing, who was from Jurong (working as an inspector at the Customs, residing at No. 4, Tianlefang, Xieqiao Lane). He generally stated that the deceased had a strange and eccentric personality during his lifetime, and his relationship with his wife was very poor, with very little interaction even with relatives. He was particularly harsh on his two sons, often beating and scolding them, and even once stopped providing them with schooling. He also stated that Zhou Jing did indeed have heart disease. Whether his two sons had mental illness and the reason for killing their biological father, whether it was for property, he did not know. Then, Zhou Qinji was brought to the case to be questioned about the reasons for the appeal. Qinji suddenly overturned all the confessions he had made during the first trial, in which he admitted to killing his father with his brother and how they had destroyed the body to conceal the evidence. He claimed that he disagreed with the first instance judgment for</p>
<p>three reasons:</p>
<p>(1) My father's death was solely the act of my younger brother. I was unaware of it. At the time, the police wrongly accused me of being an accomplice. (2) The age issue. (3) My mother is truly innocent. During my father's lifetime, he treated my mother and us very poorly, causing us great suffering. On the night of December 5th last year, around 9:00 PM, Qinxiang went to sleep as usual. I also went to bed at 11:00 PM. In the middle of the night, I suddenly heard my brother walking around, which startled me awake. I saw my brother and asked him what was wrong. He said that he had killed our father by using an electric wire to shock his head, and he died instantly. I went to check and saw my father's body lying on the bed, his head and face covered with a blanket. I thought that since things had already come to this, I deeply considered burying the body, but because I had no money, I could not do it. So, I found my father's cash and passbook in the drawer. The next morning, I went to the French Park with my brother to discuss it. At that time, my brother also expressed his approval. Later, my brother wanted to buy something, so I gave him the money and let him go first. I did not return home until after 5:00 PM. I saw my brother had already returned and was dismembering my father's body on the balcony. The head and feet had already been cut off, and he was sawing off one leg. I asked my brother why he was doing this. He replied that because the body was too big, it had to be cut into smaller pieces before it could be packed and transported out. At that moment, we suddenly heard knocking on the door below. I asked who it was. He replied it was the police. We were greatly alarmed and I went downstairs to open the door and was arrested. This fact was solely the act of my brother. Because my sister, Qinzhua, was usually</p>
<p>quite compatible with me</p>
<p>but not with my brother, so at the time we discussed this matter at home, that it would be done jointly by me and my brother, so that Qinzhua would not report it to the police, etc. The court inquired in great detail about the Zhou family's housing conditions, lasting for a long time. Then, Western detective Naluofu testified that this case was reported to the police station by Zhou Qinzhua, and he led Chinese detectives to investigate the situation. When questioned by Zhou Qinxiang, he confessed that his father was murdered by him personally and had nothing to do with his brother. Because he usually liked to study radio engineering, he bought electric wires that day, etc., and his brother did not pay attention. At that time, he first inserted an electric wire into a plug, and when his father was sound asleep, he placed it on his temple. Fearing that he was not dead, he placed another lamp wire separately on his hands and feet. Although my father cried out at the time, his voice was very low. After my father died, he covered his head with a blanket and asked his brother to help carry the corpse to another small room. I lifted the head, and my brother lifted the feet. Then, I heard my mother calling. I went to my mother's room, and she asked me what was wrong. I replied that my father had been killed by me. My mother was greatly shocked upon hearing this, saying that killing your father is the same as killing me. Since things had come to this, I did not say much more. At this time, my sister also got up, and I discussed with her</p>
<p>the disposal of the body. The court asked, why did you kill your father? He replied, because my father treated my mother extremely poorly, often beating her, causing her great suffering, especially recently. He deliberately made things difficult for my mother. My mother had to eat porridge because she suffered heart disease, but my father would not allow it and insisted that she cook rice. He also deliberately turned on the radio, causing my mother to catch a cold, which would worsen her illness. Such things were countless. His treatment of my brothers and me was even worse. Not only did he beat us at will, but he also forbade us from studying, claiming that we were not his biological sons and, therefore, did not treat us as his own. Both of them also stated that their mother really did not know about it beforehand and was wronged. Then, Zhou Jing was brought to the case, stating that she was fifty years old this year and married the deceased at the age of twenty-four. Three years later, she gave birth to her eldest daughter, Qinzhua. The following year, she gave birth to Qinji, and three years later, she gave birth to Qinxiang. So, both sons were her own. She reiterated that she was abused by her husband, and her two sons could not bear to sit idly by, leading to this absurd disaster. She really did not know about it beforehand, and she was upstairs during the dismemberment, so she did not know either. When she spoke of her heartbreak, tears streamed down her face. All the male and female audience members in the court felt saddened by it. Finally, she said that this case</p>
<p>was destined</p>
<p>and was a calamity from a previous life. More than a month before the incident, her house was haunted by ghostly sounds all night long. She thought that she would soon die, but she did not expect this great change to occur. She also pointed out that her two sons were extremely intelligent, but they were misled by their intelligence. The court then ordered the informer, Yin Xiang, to be brought to the court. He was twenty-six years old, from Dong. He was questioned about his brother's age. He stated that Qinji was twenty-five years old, Yin Zhuan was twelve years old. Before the incident, he was hot. He was called by Yin Xiang, who said that father had already been killed. The body had been tied up with ropes, so he did not see it. But Li Brothers said that father was killed by both of them, and the body was also broken down by both of them. The relationship between his father and his brothers was always bad. In the middle, he once stopped them from studying. He also claimed that his mother, Zhou Jing, was being unfairly treated. Finally, the court summoned the tenant Xu Yuanzhang and Chen Jing, Zhou Jing's sister, for questioning. By then, the clock struck seven. The court stated that</p>
<p>the case was clear</p>
<p>and could begin the debate. However, the defendants' lawyers stated that they needed to sort out the defendants' testimonies today before they could prepare defense materials. They requested an investigation into the age issues of the two defendants because if Zhou Yinxiang was eighteen years old, he would not have been eighteen years old when the incident occurred last year. The statutory age was related to the case. Also, the appellants had traditional mental illnesses, and they could not determine the forensic report, deeming it unsatisfactory. They requested a re-examination. The court, after considering the situation, ordered that a separate request be submitted for the re-examination and be approved. It also ordered the Chinese detective in charge to go to Zhou Qinzhua's house with her after the court adjourned to search for the two defendants' graduation certificates or related documents to verify their ages. The case was adjourned to a later date for further questioning. The defendants were sent back to detention separately. The court adjourned at 7:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Tenants of the China Bank Building Refuse Rent Increase, Stalemate Continues</h3>
<p>The tenants of the China Bank Building on Avenue Edward VII received a letter from the landlord in early February of this year, stating that rents would be increased by 10% to 50%. However, the tenants argued that it was difficult to make a living at this time, and they could not afford another rent increase. Moreover, the only reason given for the rent increase by several large buildings in the city was the soaring price of coal used for heating. Since the China Bank Building did not provide heating, the landlord's reason was insufficient. Therefore, they convened a meeting of tenants and asked the landlord to retract the order, but the landlord did not comply. Consequently, the matter has reached a stalemate. The landlord has not yet received the rent for March. Therefore, the tenants have decided to deposit the rent in court this week.</p>

According to the Police report, the incident was caused by the cyclist obstructing her path. While Mrs. Vick offered assistance to the injured cyclist, a "Avenue" police patrol came to the scene. She was taken to the Route Ghisi Detachment.  The Police Department reported to Jing'an Temple Police Station. After two hours of debate, Mrs. Vick paid five dollars to settle the matter.</p>

<h3>Rummaging Through Old Newspapers Sixty-Seven Years Ago (351)</h3>
<p>(From This Newspaper in the Twelfth Year of Tongzhi, Qing Dynasty)</p>
<p>The Situation in Burma</p>
<p>Burma is a small country among the islands of Southeast Asia. It is neighbored by Yunnan, Bengal, and India, and is eyed covetously by major powers such as Russia and England. They are constantly watching it from the sidelines. Although it pays tribute to China, China's reach is limited and cannot provide timely assistance. How should it be cautious, self-reliant, and unite with friendly nations while resisting the schemes of strong neighbors? It is rumored that after the new king of Burma ascended the throne, he became tyrannical, cruel, and reckless, without any sense of governance. He treats national affairs as a game, and the ancestral heritage is in danger of falling. The Book of Documents says: "Calamities sent by Heaven may be avoided, but those caused by oneself cannot." Mencius said: "A state must first smite itself before others smite it." Now, the Burmese king has no one to smite him, but he is willing to inflict calamity upon himself and invite others to smite him. How can his misfortune be far off? Generally, the survival of a small country depends entirely on precise internal governance, leaving no gap for others to exploit, so that it can resist foreign insults. In the past, the state of Zheng in the Eastern Zhou Dynasty, as a weak state sandwiched between the two major powers of Jin and Chu, delivered sacrifices and jade to both states, and its situation was precarious. However, the state, though weak, could not be destroyed because of Zichan's reforms, which maintained the overall situation and established the foundation of the state. Qin Shi Huang and Sui Yangdi, with the dignity of emperors and the unification of the world, were admired and feared by everyone. However, Qin Shi Huang's burning of books and burying of scholars led to resentment, and Chen Sheng's uprising was supported by the world. The solidity of Hangu Pass could not be relied upon, and the power of the First Emperor could not be restored. Emperor Yang of Sui, relying on his predecessors' legacy, indulged in his desires, and bandits rose up, leading to the country's demise. What they relied on was surely greater than what Burma relies on, but it ultimately could not save them from destruction. It is clear that the gathering and dispersal of people's hearts is related to the rise and fall of the state, which is not a superficial matter. Ancient people say, "The people do not constantly cherish, but cherish those with benevolence." These are good words.</p>

<h3>Crime is a Disease</h3>
<p>By Huang Jiayin</p>
<p>Today, the advanced judicial systems of Western civilized countries have embarked on a new and rational path.</p>
<p>In European and American countries, judges, prison officers, psychiatrists, psychological experts, and criminologists have formed an unbreakable chain. Their attitude towards handling criminal cases is scientific, researched, and analytical, rather than speculative and conjectural.</p>
<p>They view crime as a disease, a social disease, a mental disease. They are the doctors treating this criminal disease, and their purpose is to diagnose and cure.</p>
<p>Therefore, the new judicial approach to crime is educational, instructive, and transformative. Condemning, punitive, and retaliatory justice has gradually been eliminated by the times.</p>
<p>China is relatively backward in science, but our judicial authorities should still make the most of the scientific tools we have to study and analyze criminal cases. In this way, we hope to achieve a fairer and more reasonable judgment in cases large and small.</p>

<h3>The American Parricide Case</h3>
<p>— Jin Chun</p>
<p>Recently, a parricide case occurred in Shanghai, causing a sensation for a time. Now, seeing that similar incidents are happening in the United States, it is clear that this is a serious social problem. However, beyond uttering the clichéd phrases "the world is going to the dogs, people's hearts are no longer as they used to be" and putting on a show of "their wickedness has reached its limit, satisfying the hearts of the people," it seems there should be a proactive solution.</p>
<p>In the United States, there were two boys who would kill their own fathers. One was only twelve years old at the time, and the other was fifteen. The twelve-year-old saw his father, drunk, beating his mother, and wanting to save his mother, he drew a gun and shot his father dead. As for the fifteen-year-old, he loved his mother and older sister very much, and he also loved his father, but at the same time, he couldn't help but hate him, because his father was in love with another woman. One Saturday, he went to his father and begged him to come home. His father agreed, saying he would definitely be back for dinner on Sunday. The boy was overjoyed when he heard this and ran home, skipping and jumping. He helped his mother and sister tidy the room, helped them arrange and decorate, and helped them plan and prepare for the next day's dinner.</p>
<p>The next day, Sunday afternoon, every five minutes he would run to the door and look down the street. Every few minutes, his mother would look in the mirror and then check the stove. Every few minutes, his sister would light the candles on the table, pause, and then blow them out again.</p>
<p>Later, they knew that Dad wasn't coming home that night.</p>
<p>The mother threw herself on the bed and couldn't help but cry bitterly, and the older sister also sobbed uncontrollably in her room.</p>
<p>The boy secretly took his father's gun and slipped out, heading towards the bar. "He asked from outside the window, 'Dad, are you planning to come home?'"</p>
<p>The father laughed loudly and said, "I'm not going back."</p>
<p>The boy opened fire, shooting his father dead with one shot. He went straight home and waited for the police to arrive and arrest him. He confessed to the crime of parricide, but as a prosecutor was about to pass sentence, a Catholic priest, Father Leonard, suddenly intervened.</p>
<p>He said, "The reason why this child committed the crime is because he loves his mother. This problem is too big, too complex, this problem is not something that a child of this young age can solve. And the motive that drove him to commit the crime is completely beyond the child's control. You can't blame this child."</p>
<p>He then cited the "Boys Town" he founded as evidence, Boys Town being dedicated to educating and nurturing homeless children and problem children. He asked the court for custody of the boy, guaranteeing that he could make him a respectable citizen.</p>
<p>The boy's mother couldn't help but cry with emotion when she heard the priest's defense, and the audience was so moved that they lost control, cheering and weeping alternately. The judge couldn't stop the crowd from revealing their feelings, and he himself was deeply moved.</p>
<p>Medicine</p>
<h3>Examination of Mental Abnormality</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiade</p>
<p>According to the research of modern psychologists, there is a very close relationship between crime and mental abnormality. Therefore, when some criminals are tried, they must undergo a mental abnormality examination so that the judge's judgment can obtain a reasonable and just basis. When modern psychiatry experts examine criminals, they usually start with family history, personal history, medical history, physical examination, neurological examination, and mental examination. The examination situation in these six aspects is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Family History—The investigation of family history is an extremely important task. The examiner must try to investigate whether the criminal's ancestors have suffered from mental, neurological, or physical illnesses. This fact can be obtained from the criminal's relatives and friends, or teachers or officials who supervised him, or the criminal himself. However, the criminal's relatives may deliberately deceive and obscure the facts for the sake of the family's reputation, and at the same time, the criminal himself may not be able to make accurate reports due to mental abnormalities. This point should be paid special attention to. Regarding this aspect, the most important thing is to investigate whether his parents, grandparents, or collateral relatives have suffered from madness, neuropathy, alcoholism, lung disease, venereal disease, arthritis, or other physical illnesses, whether they have had narcotic drug addictions, or whether they have had criminal or suicidal behavior. These facts are extremely related to the criminal's background and environment.</p>
<p>(2) Personal History—The examination of personal history must begin from the time the criminal was not yet born. When he was conceived, did his parents suffer from physical illnesses; when he was born, did his mother suffer from the pain of difficult labor? What was his childhood life like, when did he start school, what were his grades like, did he ever drink alcohol or take narcotics, and did he ever suffer from venereal disease? What were his sexual habits like, did he suffer from masturbation or have improper sexual relations? Was his married life happy? (Some facts, of course, are not easily obtained.) The examiner can know the general situation of the criminal's mental structure, personality, and living environment from these facts.</p>
<p>(3) Medical History—The examiner must try to find out how the criminal's illness was caused. Before committing the crime, did he suffer any major physical or mental stimulation or blows? Was his behavior abnormal? He may have suffered from insomnia, poor appetite, depression, memory loss, or he may have wanted to commit suicide or murder. He may have felt that he could not adapt to the environment. This fact is very related to the cause of the crime, so it should be recorded in detail.</p>
<p>(4) Physical Examination—When experts examine the criminal's body, they can know whether he is depressed, happy, suspicious, irritable, combative, or whether he has a hostile attitude. Are his movements agile, accurate, purposeful, or slow, suppressed, aimless? His appearance and attitude in conversation can also often reveal his mental state. In addition, the structure of various parts of the body, the digestive system, the respiratory system, the circulatory system, the glandular system, and the current state of reproductive and urinary functions must also be paid attention to. It is also essential to thoroughly examine whether the criminal suffers from serious diseases such as diabetes, lung disease, venereal disease, gonorrhea, metal poisoning, or syphilis.</p>
<p>(5) Neurological Examination—Regarding this aspect, experts pay attention to the criminal's neurological state, how his eyes move, how the nervous system reacts in various parts of the body, how the muscles move, how the skin generally feels in various parts, how the five senses function, how the internal organs react, what his language and writing skills are like, and whether he has suffered from convulsions, etc.</p>
<p>(6) Mental Examination—The purpose of mental examination is to find out whether the criminal has had disturbances in consciousness, whether he has had hallucinations or delusions, whether his feelings, judgment, or understanding have been confused, whether his attention and memory have declined, whether his thoughts are disordered, whether his emotions are abnormal, and whether his willpower has been impaired, because these phenomena will directly affect the criminal's behavior. This examination must be very thorough and very detailed. If possible, the criminal's answers must be recorded for reference. The examiner must first make detailed considerations of the criminal's educational level and life experience before determining his mental state. This type of examination is very helpful for the reasonable judgment of the case.</p>
<p>Psychology</p>
<h3>Madness and Crime</h3>
<p>— Luo Daoai</p>
<p>Among all kinds of criminals, the number of the insane accounts for a considerable proportion. The criminal behavior of the insane is often not easy to distinguish from the criminal behavior of ordinary people, because in addition to studying the fundamental motive of the crime, ordinary external behavior is not enough to be the standard for determining the insane and ordinary people. People with mental disorders sometimes show considerable skill and wisdom in their criminal behavior, and it looks like a deliberate and planned action, so they are regarded as mentally sound criminals. He may also deliberately mystify and try to cover up his criminal behavior in order to evade responsibility and punishment. However, this is his instinctive behavior to preserve himself, and we should not use this as a reason to prove that his spirit is absolutely sound.</p>
<p>Epilepsy is one of the most important causes of pathological criminal behavior. According to the examination results of prison doctors, the majority of criminals with mental illness suffer from epilepsy. Some epileptics appear to be fully conscious when committing crimes, but in fact, his consciousness is almost completely lost; when he returns to his normal mental state, he completely cannot remember the behavior he has done. In addition to epilepsy, the most common mental illnesses suffered by criminals are early-onset dementia, partial paralysis, depressive insanity, hysterical insanity, postpartum insanity, senile neurological disorder, brain syphilis, narcotic neurological disorder, and idiocy.</p>
<p>The criminal behavior of the insane is mostly targeted at people. According to experts' surveys, there are three times more murderers among criminals suffering from madness than ordinary criminals, and there are one to one and a half times more offenders of rape, sodomy, and incest than ordinary criminals. The authorities of the Indiana State Prison in the United States have compiled the criminal behavior of 2,265 prisoners as follows:</p>
<p>Those who committed murder...5.3 percent</p>
<p>Those who committed rape, sodomy, and incest...6.1 percent</p>
<p>Those who committed murder and rape...14.6 percent</p>
<p>Those who committed petty theft...53.2 percent</p>
<p>Among the criminals suffering from insanity:</p>
<p>Those who committed murder...16.6 percent</p>
<p>Those who committed rape, sodomy, and incest...9.8 percent</p>
<p>Those who committed murder and rape...30.5 percent</p>
<p>Those who committed petty theft...37.7 percent</p>
<p>It can be seen that the majority of criminals suffering from madness are targeted at people. This makes us know that criminals suffering from madness must be kept in isolated confinement.</p>
<h3>Attacking the World of Anopheles Mosquitoes M.Chin.172</h3>
<p>The world of Anopheles mosquitoes is not a figment of novelists' imaginations, but truly exists among humans, and its power is often vast, sacrificing the lives of 350 million people every year, and the losses it adds to industry and commerce are even more insignificant. Therefore, people from various countries in the world feel compelled to rise up and try to eliminate this harmful creature.</p>
<p>Anopheles mosquitoes often carry out their terrifying work in the darkness, and their power lies in a substance invisible to the naked eye, but part of the reason they can be so rampant is also due to the general public's lack of knowledge.</p>
<p>Although the secret of Anopheles mosquitoes was discovered by the Englishman Ross in the nineteenth century, their evil power has not yet been eliminated. Anopheles mosquitoes are cruel by nature, and whether rich or poor, scholars, farmers, workers, or merchants, men, women, old or young, or those who believe in Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, or Brahmanism, can hardly escape once they fall into their hands. Moreover, Anopheles mosquitoes are scattered all over the world, and wherever they go, they first carry malaria themselves, and when humans are bitten by them, they are also infected.</p>
<p>According to reports, 80 million people suffer from malaria every year, which proves that Anopheles mosquitoes are indeed one of the greatest enemies of mankind. Fortunately, the League of Nations is assisting people all over the world in eradicating mosquitoes, and its method is to make the public aware of the efficacy of quinine in treating malaria. The League of Nations Malaria Committee advocates taking six grains of quinine daily during the epidemic period to prevent it, and taking fifteen to twenty grains of quinine daily for five to six to seven days after being infected with malaria. Page 124 of the Malaria Committee's 1938 report specifically points out that quinine is safe and harmless, and ordinary people can use it without the supervision of a doctor, while comprehensive medicines cannot be used without the supervision of a doctor.</p>
<p>After using the above methods, the harm of Anopheles mosquitoes is limited. If there were no quinine, a magic drug for treating malaria, humans would be arbitrarily ravaged by Anopheles mosquitoes and would be left to die, it can be asserted.</p>
<h3>Jesus and the Unemployed (1)</h3>
<p>I have often heard people say that Jesus' teachings are no longer in line with the times and cannot be applied to the circumstances of this era. Jesus lived in a frugal rural culture, and even if there were any social problems at that time, they did not go beyond the scope of villages or small towns. If the problems were not completely solved, neighbors helped each other to deal with them. But today, the situation is very different. Our social problems are national, and some of them have become world problems. Because the handicrafts of the past have been replaced by machine industry and mass production, in addition, there are various other changes. Even so, when it comes down to it, modern social problems are only different in size from the Galilean social problems that Jesus knew, but there is no difference in nature. To put it bluntly, they are still some old problems. We can see from the parable in Matthew 20:1-16 that Jesus and his disciples were already familiar with the problem of unemployment in that simple society. In this parable, Jesus did not suggest how to deal with the problem of unemployment. That was not what he was thinking about. He used this unemployment problem to interpret other greater things. In the parable, he talked about God's justice, which undoubtedly wanted the world to treat each other with justice. He unintentionally expressed his feelings about unemployment. It's just that his main meaning is not to see this problem as an economic problem, but as a humanitarian problem. We have a different view from him. We regard it as an economic problem. So our plan, B, is to use charity to solve it. Jesus put the humanitarian purpose first, and the economic problem must adapt to the humanitarian needs. If Jesus were alive today, I think his concept must be: people should not adapt to the economic system, but the economic system should adapt to people. In this way, the problem of unemployment, in Jesus' eyes, is of course first a humanitarian problem. Anyone who knows the plight of unemployment holds this view. When unemployment panic occurred in various countries, the various facts of the fall of the people were everywhere. Very good people, because their furniture was sent to the pawnshop piece by piece, sank into despair; the unemployed, because they have been idle for too long, have become unable to work; their hearts have been stimulated and broken by the hunger of their wives and children. So, they felt a great anger in their hearts and opposed the current social system. If we were there, we would naturally feel that we were living in a world of madmen. The people are the vitality of the country, and the current social system is sitting idly by and watching this vitality decline. This is something that urgently needs to be improved. I am not an economist. I don’t know if this cycle of rise and fall can be eliminated. However, I myself think that such things can be avoided. People have such wisdom and should have such social vision, and at least they must alleviate these reactionary tensions. For example, use unemployment insurance to prevent it. Protecting the vitality of a country—the great cause of the people—should not be done casually by private or semi-private charity work, nor should those who are unemployed through no fault of their own be allowed to accept the humiliation of private or public charity.

<h3>Lin Yutang Promotes Ethics and Morality</h3>
<p>— Hai Xing</p>
<p>Returning to China next month and transferring to the inland</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Yutang, a famous Chinese scholar, will return to China from the United States in mid-next month. He is scheduled to go to Hong Kong first, and then transfer to the inland. Lin Hanlu, the editor of "Cosmic Wind" sponsored by him, will go to Hong Kong from Shanghai to meet him. Some cultural figures in Hong Kong also plan to prepare a welcome. It is reported that when Lin Yutang gave speeches to overseas Chinese in the United States, he greatly promoted the ethics and morality of our country. Lin said: "When overseas Chinese are abroad, they often see the development of foreign material civilization, which is beyond the reach of our country, and they are most likely to develop a sense of inferiority. They do not know that Eastern civilization inherently has something that Westerners cannot match and are admired by them, which is the Chinese way of ethics and morality. For thousands of years in China, the most refined and greatest contribution has been the philosophy of ethics and morality, which, in simple terms, is the way to be a human being. Our people have a deep understanding of this kind of truth, and they are particularly strong in practice. Seeing that our overseas Chinese are always known for their honesty and virtue in the world, and are unwilling to violate local laws, Westerners have said that "Although there are many overseas Chinese in New York, they do not spend a penny on the police." A Westerner also said, "Chinese people from top to bottom are all civilized gentlemen." From this point of view, what Westerners know about our country is this way of being a human being. Overseas Chinese can give full play to this kind of virtue when they are dealing with Westerners in foreign countries. No wonder Westerners are pleased, and the overseas Chinese have made a great contribution to the cultural promotion of our country."</p>
<h3>Jin Suqin Will Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Jin Suqin went to Hong Kong for more than half a month. She was originally scheduled to perform at the Lee Theater on the 12th, but now it has been cancelled. This news was confirmed by Suqin's own letter. Her original letter had the following paragraphs: The first batch of actors at the Hong Kong Lee Theater have been on stage for more than 10 days, and the box office is not good. It is estimated that they will lose about 6,000 to 7,000 Hong Kong dollars. Moreover, the team is not complete. Many scripts cannot be performed. If they are hired in Shanghai, then time is not allowed. Hong Kong Peking Opera audiences are limited to ordinary Shanghainese, as well as a small number of Cantonese people (curious and interested in drama, or Cantonese people who have lived in Shanghai for a long time.) There are two main reasons above, so I am afraid that the prediction of the performance results in Hong Kong cannot reach the ideal perfection. The lessons of the past make me extraordinarily lack courage...</p>
<p>Since I am not performing in Hong Kong, I will stay for a few days and then return to Shanghai. I am now living in Happy Valley. The literal translation of the English name is "Happy Valley," but I don't feel happy.</p>
<h3>Hong Jingling Knocks Out His Front Teeth</h3>
<p>— Xiao Zai</p>
<p>Hong Jingling was an old man in the film department of the Commercial Press in those years. He has been making movies for nearly 30 years, and half of his hair is gray, but he was unfortunately knocked out of two front teeth by Gu Lanjun in his recent work "Huang Tianba". Because there was a scene where Gu Lanjun held a steel knife in her hand, and because she hated Lan Tianbao (played by Hong Jingling) for provoking and ruining the marriage, she swung a knife at him. Hong Jingling retreated backwards, a little slower, and Gu Lanjun's move was a little faster. The knife hit Hong Jingling's mouth! Two front teeth immediately fell out. Although this scene was successfully filmed, Hong Jingling sacrificed too much. Hong said to people afterwards: "I have lived to this age, and I still have this disaster!"</p>

<h3>Betty Davis' Impression of "Hollywood"</h3>
<p>— Da Ni</p>
<p>Do you think it's easy to make friends in Hollywood? That's completely wrong. I have a total of three friends in Hollywood, and none of them are in the film industry.</p>
<p>In terms of career, Hollywood gives me amazing satisfaction; in terms of personality, she has also increased my "courage" and "patience"</p>
<p>There is a saying that you can often hear in Hollywood: "Is she a lovely woman?" I think this is the biggest insult.</p>
<p>The worst thing is: you can't always completely insist on your own ideas in Hollywood. For example: I used to swear not to bleach my hair, but now I have; I also swore not to wear suspenders, but later I wore them, and I continue to wear them now.</p>
<p>Hollywood has also changed my "outlook on life." In the past, I only knew how to enjoy myself. Now, I am willing to spend some time using my brain to think.</p>
<h3>Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden (Opera World)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Ma Lianliang's Square Flags in "Mount Litong" (Continued)</p>
<p>Since Lianliang claims that the script of "Mount Litong" was obtained from the Duke Yansheng's Mansion, and is the original version of the Anhui opera, and the flag shape is square, then all Anhui operas are the ancestors of Peking opera. Why not increase the four flags to eight, making up the grandeur of eight directions (eight square flags) and the eight sides (eight flags) of the great general? If so, it would feel even more novel and coincidental. Restoring the past only reaches halfway, and the courage is not yet full. Moreover, what he calls the dragon-tiger armor is neither dragon above tiger below, nor dragon on the left and tiger on the right, nor dragon on the front and tiger on the back. It's just that he has a dragon and a tiger embroidered on the abdomen of the armor. To call it dragon-tiger armor with this is rather far-fetched. Moreover, it has always been customary to embroider a tiger's head in the middle of the abdomen of the armor, which represents the bravery of a military general, similar to the meaning of tiger, leopard, lion, and elephant. Furthermore, the colors of theatrical costumes and embroidered patches are often yellow, purple, red, blue, and black to determine the rank and status, and cranes, chickens, peacocks, geese, and silver pheasants are embroidered (first-rank immortal crane, second-rank brocade chicken, third-rank peacock, fourth-rank cloud goose, fifth-rank white silver pheasant). These patterns are used to distinguish the levels of hierarchy. If the position of a character in the play is not as high as a king or emperor, he must not use the dragon pattern (mainly embroidered with silver thread, only the emperor can embroider a gold dragon). In the past, the rules in the south were extremely strict, but now most do not follow the old system. Also, the patterns on the armor are mostly in the shape of fish scales to symbolize the meaning of iron leaves, but now they are also changed at will. However, no matter what, it has always been seen that the dragon and tiger are embroidered on the abdomen of the armor at the same time. Now, Ma Lianliang especially uses this to show off, which is truly what is called neither dragon nor tiger, neither donkey nor horse. Coupled with the fact that Lianliang is not good at wearing armor, and his feet have no roots, he especially feels that the square flags are clumsy and inflexible. I say that he does not know how to conceal his shortcomings, and it is for this reason.</p>
