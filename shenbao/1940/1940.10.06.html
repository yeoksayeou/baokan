<p>日本輿論界希望　美對日政策諒解</p>
<p>東京　日本各報今日咸以顯著地位刊載近衛首相日昨在西京發表之談話、惟日本各報之標題、並無向美國挑戰之意、僅云、若華盛頓承認日德義三國之目的、則日本亦願與美國重修舊好、美國目前必須與日本維持其友好關係、承認日本在遠東之領袖地位、以及德義在歐菲兩洲之目的、東京日日新聞稱、日本深盼能與美國携手、以維護世界和平、該報繼續警告稱、如美國不更變態度、則將被逼牽入戰爭漩渦、該報並指出、至現時為止、美國尙無對日改變態度之趨向、相反地、該國反加緊對日本之壓力、重新貸款與中國及對日擴大禁運、卽其例也、該報並批評美國前曾竭力設法使滇緬公路復開、以繼續對重慶政府之接濟、該報最後認為、最近提議組織一日美聯合委會以研究遠東情勢之舉、於改變美國對日態度方面言之、巳屬過晚、（五日合衆電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>軸心國的苦悶</h3>
<p>德義日三國結盟的用意，簡單說，一在打擊彼此交戰對手的中英兩國，二在威嚇美國，迫其知難而退，中止援華助英。但是依一星期來的動態而言，結果似乎適得其反，因為（一）中國當局已宣佈既定態度與政策，絕不變更；（二）英國空軍愈戰愈勇，德國漸有放棄以空戰取勝的自信，同時戰事內閣的加强和張伯倫樞相的引退，更是英國鬥志益堅的明徵；（三）美國反對侵略的態度，益趨鮮明，不但民主共和兩黨關於國際政策的熊度，完全一致，即在國會和輿論界方面對於應付未來的兩洋威脅，甚至還有更積極的主張；（四）再就中英美三國間的聯繫來講，顯已隨着軸心國的勾結而益見密切，不說英國已保證如期開放緬滇公路，美國已聲明對英援助行將擴展至澳洲和紐西蘭，而澳洲空軍的開抵新加坡增防，與倫敦盛傳的英國將以同盟國待遇中國，美加聯防委員會的決定加緊進行太平洋海岸共同防禦計劃、以及美國議員的提議租用太平洋英屬地，凡此種種，都足以說明中英美合作的加强和擴大。就上述諸般跡象觀之，可見軸心國打擊中英和嚇退美國的一種企圖、已經完全失敗，這顯然是三國盟的的初步挫折。</p>
<p>德義日三國雖然結盟，却依然未能忘情於「各個擊破」的便宜事；所以在盟的之中，仍不願公然把歐戰和遠東戰混為一談，這正是三國同床異夢，始終企圖避免或遷延「協力合作」的供狀。露骨地講，德義的拉攏日本，其本意絕對不在幫助日本侵略中國，而實實在在是想鼓勵日本實行南進，以收牽掣英美之效；同樣地，日本的依附德義，其本意也絕對不在幫助德義以打敗英國，實實在在不過是因為「中國事件」毫無品路，美國態度日趨强硬，不得不借重德義的威勢，奢望打斷中英美的合作。在這樣一段交易中，無疑地，日本所付的代價最大，而德義臼有無收穫，却根本是疑問。就日本講，他在未結盟之前，猶可借着「不介入政策」的幌子，向英美允其是英國敲一些小竹槓、現在既已自絕於英美，便休想再有取巧的餘地；此其結果。一方有喪失美國市塲和遭受全部封鎖的危險，一方卻無法自德義方面取得相等的補償：今後除非孤注一擲的蠻幹，悍然南進，莫想找判便宜。但是，要南進，便須北守；要北守，便須討好蘇聯；這是東京政府的極難課題。因為，誠如本報連日所論，蘇聯對於東亞戰局的認識，逈非日本武人所能想像，莫斯科決不肯縱容日本於毀滅中國，囊括南洋之後，再由自已來和他算賬；白熊不比笨猪，決不致連這作繭自縛，養癰貽患的小小道理都不能參透。</p>
<p>就德義講，他們所以要嚇退美國，無非是想迅速擊敗英國，可是事實上美國即使不和英國並肩作戰，邱吉爾領導下之倫敦政府，未必便會輕易屈服。第一，德國空戰的策略、雖不能說完全失敗，至少已受到意想不到的挫折；據前日本報歐戰叢談所介紹的美國報道，自八月八日德國首决晝襲英倫起，至九月十六日止，德機已喪失一午八百架，陣亡　被俘的飛行員的六千人，而英方損失不過飛機六百餘架，飛行員二百九十餘人；何况今後的氣候，更將不利於德國的攻勢；英吉利海峽每年風平浪靜的季節，祗有七八九三個月，若說渡海登陸，恐怕比空襲還要棘手；同時義國在東菲洲的攻勢，近來也沒有什麼顯著，除非地中海上的海軍形勢發生劇變，使得義大利本部和東菲屬地間的交通綫，完全解除英國艦隊的威脅，義國遠征軍的攻勢－至少在目前－是不得不特別愼重的。然則德義為取勝計，似乎單靠恫嚇美國，將無濟於事，而必須進一步在地中海方面再打開一條出路。換句話說，不是設法使西班牙參戰，以控制英屬直布羅陀港，便須在東南歐洲發動新的冒險舉動，以改變目下地中海東部的戰略形勢；但是就前者講。西班牙是不是肯替德義「在火中取栗」大是疑問：就後者講，一牽到東南歐，便不能不顧到蘇聯的意旨。前天德義兩巨頭在兩國外長會談不久之後，竟父親自勞駕再度晤面，足見雙方有十分重要的問題，急待商議，因此，在今後數日之內，德義的動態，允其是德義和西蘇兩國的關係，實是應加注意的焦點所在。</p>
<p>綜上所述、可見軸心國各有各的煩惱：日本的難題，是不知如何纔能北守南進，如何纔能南進而不付重大代價；德義的難題，是不知如何纔能在不招致更多麻煩的條件之下，使英國速敗；這些難題，終於能吾得到解決，至少在目前是異常苦悶而絕對沒有把握；並且極可能的，得到相反的結果。</p>

<h3>歐美間諜恐慌</h3>
<p>關於德國間諜和便衣隊在各國活動情形，本報已經譯載了一篇美國　軍部長諾克斯的報告，茲再將一大西洋月報」駐歐訪員，和美國偵緝處長胡佛的報告，譯錄如次。</p>
<p>斯干的那維亞各國雖號稱「民治國」，但國社黨却極活躍。德國運輸艦阿爾瑪克號在挪威領海被英船　擊事，就是開人眼界的一件。丹麥挪威的陷落實在是德國間諜勝利的表現。丹麥早有間諜蜂房之稱。如果明白南遮特蘭地方，因凡爾賽條的規定的結果，住有三萬德國少數民族，此種情形就不足驚奇了。丹麥當局曾再三告誡人民不得與任何外國僑民購起船舶來往情形，這實在是他們保障船舶安全的唯一方法。瑞典曾特別受戈林將軍的注意，他的第一位夫人是瑞典人，他因與瑞典保有一種密切的關係。瑞典官方的反響，或某種企圖，很少能够逃過戈林的注意。瑞典到處也密佈着蘇聯的間諜。</p>
<p>挪威也是間諜集中的國家，那些間諜大都活動於沿海一帶。其中大多數是德國領事，他們一直到被捕前，還在發出密碼無綫電。</p>
<p>挪威間諜活動已發現的綫索，遠至一九三六年。那時李斯林少校任陸軍部長，卽利用地位，先收買海軍，决收買陸軍，最後收買警官及公務人員，以爲已用。他用這樣方策，造成挪戚便衣隊的細胞。</p>
<p>國社黨在挪威的靑年運動，最初不過是一種引誘他人的威，後來引起了挪威當局的懷疑，逮捕了幾個，驅逐出境，德國使館立卽聲明承認幾百個遊客，於是挪威人吃驚不小，不敢再干涉了。到了最後時期，德國間諜唯一失策之事，是沒有把『白魯轍』號擊沉，使挪威王及政府大昌得以逃出國境。除此而外，國社黨的活動皆無懈可擊。</p>
<p>荷蘭間諜活動的發現，是在德國侵入之前，那時有若干荷蘭軍官及荷蘭國社黨秘密分子被捕，搜出荷蘭國防計劃，正預備遞交德國。荷蘭國社黨共有兩萬人。至於究有若干荷蘭陸軍及警察制服，自偷運至德國，以便德方便衣隊喬裝入境，援助德國軍隊佔領荷蘭，也許永遠是一個謎。</p>
<p>荷蘭社會部職員荷芬及經濟部職員布夫先後被捕，證明荷蘭政府中也有國社黨間謀存在。這兩人被控的罪狀是以荷蘭本國及外國船隻自荷蘭開出的情報，供給德國，致有好多船隻被擊沉。在荷芬宅中，還各國，其原因到了目前，已極明顯。他挑選好多德國人，加以訓練，使其居於鄰國之內，以便與降落傘部隊，保持接觸。這些人實爲德國征服鄰國的另一種實力。</p>
<p>根據同一計劃，南斯拉夫境內，也有幾千德國人遷入。南斯拉夫對於這些人已極感焦慮了。</p>
<p>德國在荷蘭的間諜，還有婦女在內。此類婦女的有下列幾種：</p>
<p>（一）德國居民的妻女及姪女。此地所提起的『姪女』，　意義特別廣泛。</p>
<p>（二）嫁與荷蘭人的德國婦女依然熱誠爲德國工作時常勸誘荷蘭丈夫，變爲親德份子。</p>
<p>（三）類似女學生的獨身婦女，參加商業活動，爲旅館女招待，爲伴侶，爲音樂隊員，或爲舞蹈塲藝員。</p>
<p>（四）擔任婢女及看房娘姨，大都能力極充分，受過高等敎育。</p>
<p>這些女性便衣隊，對於德國降落傘部隊，都曾盡了地主的仟務。她們以符號指示飛機，領導傘兵落地，然後與之取得聯絡，領他們到重要據點。她們並且供給傘兵各衣股服，多方面指導他們，並供給各項情報。</p>
<p>從前馬太哈利式的女間諜已不時髦，現在代之而起的已是希特勒式訓練有素機警老練的女間諜了。</p>
<p>幌子，後來便從公務員，法律界，敎會，新聞界，及商界方面吸收重要人物。對於政客則不加收買。冒險家也不大受歡迎，只有結實分子才加以收買。因此之故，德方便衣隊中最得力的分子，便是那些最不引人注意的人物。其中『自由民族』的編輯李旭夫特目前代表德國宜傳部長郭培爾，擔任奧斯洛新聞檢查處長。</p>
<p>挪威便衣隊第二期的發展，是在一九三八年。當時國社黨的間諜，假充外交參贊，新聞記者，售貨員，商人，商業經理人，講師，難民，亡命之徒等人，潛入挪威境內，從事活動。這些人在社會上必須受人歡迎，在職業上。又必占有地位。其中史彭德勤少校曾做挪威王哈康的侍從。這些間諜的深入挪威之後，便在德國種館保護之下，與當地的便衣隊結台。共工作嚴守秘密，最初只有幾百人，後來有幾千人，共謀叛變。德國人所擔任的間諜，如洩漏秘密，卽處死刑，所以那些德人，大都是不飲酒能守口如瓶的人。</p>
<p>第三個時期是在德國實際佔領挪威的前六個星期。其時德國有大批靑年遊歷家湧入挪搜出其他高踞要津的二十個共同犯的名單。</p>
<p>荷蘭在被侵略以前，並沒有實行大規模的剷除間諜工作。荷蘭共產黨比之挪威也較占勢力。荷蘭國社黨領袖馬塞爾脫，比挪威的李斯林，也更重要。在被侵略前幾星期，荷蘭雖曾實行戒嚴，並跟着兜捕間諜，但實際上那些被捕的間諜不過是九牛一毛，德方便衣隊的確實數目雖不可知，然可斷言者，荷蘭國社黨員，至少有兩萬人，相等數目的德僑還不計算在內。</p>
<p>這些便衣隊的工作，是向全國散佈謠言，謂英法兩國將侵犯荷蘭的中立。馬塞爾脫以每個荷蘭人應有言論或寫作自由爲藉口，依然自由活動，未被逮捕。在德軍侵入以前，這些便衣隊甚至連毫毛都未動。荷蘭的陷落已證明是全國</p>
<p>滿佈着德國便衣隊的結果。荷蘭外交部長克勤芬曾謂，在德軍侵入前兩日，阿姆斯特丹一個重要銀行家被搜，並搜出荷蘭政府掘堤放水淹沒全國的全部計劃。目前眞相已經洩露，指導便衣隊擊潰荷蘭的，就是德國公使館中一個不著名的參贊，名叫杜丁傳士其人。</p>
<p>希特勒把德國人移居鄰近國社黨大批間諜在比國活動，早已使比王利渥波特及比利時國社主義派萊克斯黨之問，在德國進攻前發生嚴重的鬥爭。比利時國社黨曾有一時期特別拉攏比國軍官，因此，比國軍官中有一唐伯雷上尉，會將比國國防全部計劃告知德國間諜。</p>
<p>萊克斯黨曾竭力妨害聯軍。在夏勃羅地方被捕的岑貝羅就是那一帶間諜的首領，完全爲德國刺探比國邊境的英法大軍消息，常以刺探所得的消息，供給德國的流動間諜。</p>
<p>比王利渥波特雖曾竭力想維持中立，但萊克期黨則竭力設法把比利時捲入戰爭漩渦。在德軍便人之前，比國並無嚴格的防範辦法，但有効的行動也會實行幾項，如設立集中營，拘禁萊克斯黨人，共產黨人，及德國難民之類。這些集中營及營內犯人的管理方式却極特別。德國天主敎徒的難民須由比國天主敎黨負責管理，德國社會黨人則由比國社會黨管理，德奧猶太人則由比國猶太人各團體管理。戰爭爆發之後，比利時卽遇到四十萬外人僑居境內的問題，這數目占比國全人口的百分之五。（未完）</p>

<h3>金融述評  聖凱瓊</h3>
<p>十月五日　向金融業進一言</p>
<p>上海金融界自浙江實業銀行首先通知活存减息以後，繼起者有上海銀行，接踵而來者有中南·金城·鹽業·大陸·及其合辦的四行儲蓄會，可稱上海的主要商業儲蓄銀行都已實行减低活存利率了。其他商業儲蓄銀行或在觀望中，或在討論中，或在計擬中，實行與吾，不成問題，蓋資金運用在投機方面有利可圖不妨從緩，無利可圖再行减息，好在有例可援，亦不嫌遲。</p>
<p>分析這决銀行减息的理由，是（一）物價高翔，銀行開支巨大，恃存放利息的差額手續費等以爲絕注，難以獲利。（二）銀行放款因爲沒有安全可靠的對象，資金不易運用，從事外滙烚赤等的投機亦是危險，於是收進存款卽是坐耗利息。（三）存軟人自經安定金融辦法，馬電限制上海提存兩項措施後，祗求活動便利，對利息多少不計，均將存款轉爲活期，或甚至無利息轉存洋商銀行，事實上存戶已不听斤於利息的有無，何况於利息的多少。</p>
<p>對於這一個問題，筆者在前期金融述評中曾以「減息與資金內移」資之於上海的銀行業，現在鑒於有多家銀行樅起實行，覺得意有未盡，不嫌曉舌，向上海的金融業再進一言。</p>
<p>假定說筆者上面分析的减息理由是準確的，而金融業認爲這三個原因亦是百分之百是對的，則筆者對於第一。三點的理由不欲多言，而對第二點則可有論難之處。銀行存款增加，放款困難雖然是事實，但我們應該認淸事實，存款增加不是二十九年份開始，而放款困難，亦不是二十九年份起。試一檢閱此次减息的各大商業儲蓄銀行的資產負債表，從二十六年份以來，除二十六年因戰事關係存款頗見减少外，自二十七年起卽見大量增加，遠超過二十五年份的紀錄，雖其間活定增加趨勢互異，定期遲緩，活期迅速，但是銀行決不是在今年方始明瞭，而遠在二十七年份卽應感覺到了，何以銀行减息不在二十七年，不在二十八年，亦不在二十九年開始，而在二十九年的下半年？至於放款困難資金運用不易，營業紀錄所提供給我們的現象是：押放款無榮無辱，證券的投資並未增加，而同業存放大增。政府證劵的投資利益要在一分以上，何以押放款無去路，不向公債投資，反將資金積集在同業款放上？事實上某銀行自戰事發生後卽大量購存外滙，某銀行在英商匯豐銀行存款經常在一千萬以上，謂上海銀行業不在外滙市塲上投機，其誰信之！在過去銀行雖感存款增加，放款困難，但外滙投機可獲倍數十分數之利，故存款雖增，而二十七年不减息，二十八年不减息，二十九年初不减息，而在二十九年下半年的十月方始减息。</p>
<p>銀行爲何在最近方始發動减息，亦有它的客觀原因。按自五月二日外滙市塲突縮之後，投機者以爲法幣的價値愈將下跌，不意五月十日以後歐洲戰事擴大，英法軍事不利，德軍侵入荷比，上海的外商銀行發生提存風潮，爲應付起見，大量拋售外滙，外滙市塲發生甚大的賣風，行市逐步趨鬆，英滙由三便士半長到四便士關外，美滙由四元七一八七五長到五元半以上，而美滙六月末更長出六元關外。八九兩月雖在投機者利用商業滙率的改訂與越南局勢的緊張，從事扒吸，然其影響魄市的力量已成强弩之末，行市雖略見緊，而其緊勢非常緩慢，更兼現近期相差無多，無論投機套利，均無利益可圖，此其一。目今世變日急，東西兩烽火，任何一國，欲想置身事外，已不可能，則任何一國的貨幣價値，均有跌落的危險，故法幣的基礎決不致不及任何一國的貨幣基礎底堅强，除因一時的商業上供求不調或投機者利用局勢的扒吸可能地緊軟之外，法幣本身已無跌落的或然性，此其二。那末與其將存軟變成外滙在那兒，或無利的大量地存在洋商銀行，坐遭利息的損失，（這才是眞正的坐耗利息呢）不如另謀出路。可是銀行家的心理是與衆不同的，聽說某銀行存在滙豐銀行款項未動，减息後，一年中祇省利息開支二十萬元，可是某銀行決不肯將一千萬元轉存國家銀行以博取二％的二十萬元利息，它還期待外滙的投機利益，寗願坐遭利息的損失，而將這筆損失轉嫁給存款人，表面上却說銀行開支浩大，不得不减息以厚自準備呀！卽此一行，卽此一事可概其餘。</p>
<p>筆者不是故意說此時此地銀行業减息不當，總希望上海的金融業能仔細想一想，在這抗戰大時代，對於抗戰建國，究竟有多大的貢獻，還是利於國家的舉動多，還是害於國家的舉動多，不要斤斤於利益損失上打算，而能依照筆者「减息與資金內移」中所說的積極地去做！（未完）</p>
<h3>證券　內債起小回風　仍將視時局轉移</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤、昨市小起回風、筆者不幸而言中、此種趨勢、久於此道者類能言之、爲大漲小回必由之途徑、但絕不致引起跌風、故跌後旋又回高、在銀錢兩業不斷的廣泛吸收中、一時多方出籠、仍被多　搜羅而去、故前途繼續上騰、丙種六十元指顧間耳、按自默局改觀以來、滇緬路已有如期開放希望、於是美英援助已露骨表示、可見中國漸處有利地位、但另一方面、上海之現實狀態、亦不能不慮、日暮途窮、倒行逆施、則有如東方旣白、曉色朦朧、難免不有虛驚也、故債市前途之變化、仍視時局爲轉移、惟終究必有好運道也、昨日上午信孚。鴻大多頭大批出籠近百萬、信昌聯和賣出、亦極踴躍、大部爲銀錢業買去、市價祗小五六角、午後買氣突盛、鴻大買回益記聯益樂茂德孚均有始當數量吸收市况復由低而回上、信孚業已止賣恒孚信昌聯和順泰等稍有出脫、惟大戶空頭尚未抵補、昨日結果除丁種尚好五分外、餘均回小一角半至五角半不等、成交數的二百萬元、茲列簡表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、華商電氣股五百股、價爲六元五角牛、比前又漲五分云、倫敦行市無變動、</p>
<h3>疋頭　新囤戶活躍　棉布漲勢強盛</h3>
<p>國布　昨日漲勢轉烈、以惟實銷不旺、及執貨者乘機脫售關係、漲風落後尚遠、致引起新囤戶購意、交意數量漸形擴大、惟各布漲價差別極巨、自一二角至一元外、細布細斜嗶嘰直貢等上漲一元左右、粗布粗斜等二角半至五角、本街成交二千數百件、客帮需胃轉呆、英商怡和廠開出十月十一月份粗布二千餘件、</p>
<p>東布　漲風續熾、細布細斜每疋又漲七八角、嗶嘰每碼漲四分、蓋在晨開之際、因原紗在升、布盤亦極混亂、龍頭細布最高價曾見卅七元五角半、中途以同業獲利者吐售、回降至卅六元八角半，終因現價籌碼不多、業外囤戶紛集、後市開盤漲風重起、高價至卅七元四五角、收盤時一般搶帽子散戶賣出、壓降爲卅七元二角、而市氣仍殊堅挺、四君干嗶嘰收盤價爲一元一角一分半、</p>
<p>出口　疋頭、今日有三件、運往香港、又有一百七十五件、運往暹邏、</p>
<p>紗花　叫價過高　棉市擯持　連日已漲二三十元</p>
<p>現棉交易轉趨冷澹、成交比上日大爲减色、此因紗市一再上升、久處不振之棉市、漲勢與紗市之比例、相差尚遠、所以執貨者之心氣不平、但叫價過高、廠方仍不願拖進、因之遂成擯持之局面也、細絨打包三〇　〇〇保豐進　九六件</p>
<p>以上一筆係送廠價蘭貢　一八一·〇〇　盛和進四〇〇件又　一八五·〇〇　又　四〇〇件</p>

<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、市况堅定、後又因一部份之空頭抵補而漲、結果收盤價格、較之上日近期漲二三磅音、遠期漲八至十磅音、印度連同預測漲半羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來殊爲活躍、各方俱以滬上存底日微、外棉運滬之困難、且滬上售價反較海外低廉、故廠方及同業皆競相購買、價格因之猛騰、數日來已漲起二三十元之巨、按照此種悄勢、日後將有棉荒之虞也、</p>
<h3>大戶出當　棉紗狂上狂下</h3>
<p>近日之紗市、在上在下、但趨勢異常挺拔、此因香港方面、對於十支粗紗、需求尚接踵而來、同時投機者散播空氣、謂原棉被阻、來源艱難、對於棉紗一致看漲、於是推波助瀾、人心猶如發在、然迥顧六月二十八日市塲一鼓驚惶失措之狀、直瀉至八百元、無人敢勇爲接受、目前已至一千二百元、然查存紗仍在三十萬包以外、一旦與奮性一過、那時又有前車復轍之危也、今日有棉紗七十件運香港、三百五十五件運暹羅、</p>
<p>現紗晨開二十支雙馬人氣、熱烈異常、開價為一千一百八十七元、比上日收盤價漲廿元、然買風勢如潮湧、一霎閒漲至一千二百十八元、有人說到一千二百二十元、此時塲上之撈進者、如火如荼、多說謂某紗又拍停板、豈料大戶乘混亂時、忽來出檔、頃刻在喊狂叫、下落至一千一百八十元外、終以買戶尚堅、又至一千二百元外、收盤以後回小十元、爲一千一百九十元、查半日間成交統計五千九百五十五包、行情二十支漲十八元、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>同行四、九〇〇香港一、〇三五福建。二〇統計五，九五五</p>
<p>油市　生油操縱不已　售價暴升五六元</p>
<p>食油市况、一因各路銷塲未斷、二爲環境利多、所以潛勢無小面、但從一二元之漲風、已轉呈橫跳直沖之境地、一般投機無一不眉飛色舞、昨市豆油祇漲二元、因雙方交易有限、未能開展在態、惟花生油翁碼足敷操縱、致投機肆無忌憚、皮球交易姿意妄動、市價直綫上騰、結果期現油一致暴升五六元、計開膠州生油四百件、價爲八十元至八十二元二角半、十月上交一百件、價爲八十元零七角半至八十二元二角半、十月下交二千五六百件、價爲八十元零七角半至八十四元、靑島生油八十桶、價爲一百十元、十月上交五十桶、價爲一百零九兀五角、十月下交六百桶、價爲一百十元至一百十二元五角、烟台聽生油三百聽、價爲一百零五元、膠州路貨豆油二百件、價爲八十四元、大有餘廠豆油五百餘擔、價爲九十四元五角至九十五元、老棧單價爲九十二元五角九十三元、</p>
<h3>糖氏　日商進粗白</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢仍軟、略有續鬆、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白本棧七十八元、小五角、外棧七月份到七十七元半、日商洋行曾進五百包、轉口貨六十一元半不動、荷棉白BA嘜亦呈鬆象、叫七十四元半、未成、荷赤仍五十九元六角、太古車白B寥七十五元半、DY嘜七十三元三角、均小一角、HX嘜七十三元、小角半、HHM嘜六十七元、叉昨日有糖一萬一千七百包、香港來滬、</p>
<h3>五金　靑鉛鐵交易陸續</h3>
<p>靑鉛鐵市面、已久趨岑寂、惟自前昨以來、本街熱水瓶廠因睹時令已屑、故羣起採辦、以作原料、此外製罐廠等、亦不時點綴、故市象頓覺熱閙、開價步見上漲、昨如二百磅會司貨每箱售一百三十五元、雙連板二十寸二十八寸花色則每箱沽一百四十五元、查昨成交的一二百箱光景、共去路除上述二幫外、外埠客商如烟台幫亦有裝往、</p>
<p>南北貨　青島生仁　產區見新</p>
<p>靑島訊、現貨陳生仁近以二十四元成交五千包，後升至二十八元至二十九元、成交五百包、新貨亦已登塲、僅到二十包、當爲申幫辦入、價達三十八元、超出陳貨十元云、</p>

<h3>米業昨接電告　香港准米糧出口　禁止轉運命令昨已撤銷　市場人心鬆弛米價步跌</h3>
<p>香港當局爲未雨綢繆計、前曾一度頒佈命令、儲囤大宗食米、以備緊急、同時將所有儲囤食米、禁止轉　外埠、是此項消息、傳諸滬市後、米市塲人心一律趨上、米價頻頻高漲、當時整個民食恐慌異常新聲社記者昨向米業界探悉、本市米業行號、業於昨日接獲香港電告、港府當局、已於日昨撤消禁止米糧出口命令、茲將所有囤米轉運外埠、該項消息於昨晨傳佈市塲後、市况愈趨鬆弛、市價續落三四元不等、</p>
<p>增加存底</p>
<p>滬市米價之騰漲、固在投機米商團積居奇、操縱壟斷所致、然另一方面厥爲來源、時有阻運謠言、人心不無恐慌、市價勢難下落、故通暢來源增厚米糧存底、已不容刻緩、况際斯非常時期、國府鞭長莫及之時、一般投機米蠧、咸　法律如具文、私做買賣、已屬恒事。國府當局暨本市兩租界當局、雖一再飭令不得操縱大宗食米、及取締非法交易、卒因環境特殊、收效殊鮮、巨商恃勢把持、各有關米業團體、亦以「心餘力絀」、「力不勝任」爲詞、置不顧問、　整個米市、至於今日之局面</p>
<p>確保治安</p>
<p>自國洋米價頻頻高漲後、平民生計已岌岌可危、若長此以往、攸關社會整個治安，殊匪淺鮮、然兩租界當局雖在顧念及此、屢擬採取有效步驟、付諸實施、同時往返磋商穩定米市具體辦法、並迭决拘捕非法米蠧、依法懲處、惟因環境特殊、市塲非法交易、卒難一網打盡、米價猛騰不已、升斗小民、因無法生計、乃致鋋而走險、日前虹口新記浜路東　璧禮路附近、搶米一案、查係有某米號由棧司陳少淸車送白米三袋、價値二百三十元左右、甫經裝車搬出距店不遠之際、被若干平民圍奪、後卽分頭逃逸、結果被拘一人、名方阿三、已解送法院審訊、</p>
<p>集團購米</p>
<p>上海民食調節協會迭决代辦集體訂購洋米數量相當可觀茲該會決將趁此低落之時、大量集團訂購、昨日據該會某委員語稱、希望本市各工廠商號曁各機關團體、體念職工生計、代墊巨額款項、踴躍參加集團訂購洋米、若再觀望不前、使各該職工每日價需食米、仍仰給於本市各米號購糴、則本市民食勞靴驟增、某氏繼稱、本會代辦各項手被、誠實可靠、並純係義務制、故望各大工廠等尅日前往辦理購米手續、俾便着手大量訂購、定期運滬分配應永、</p>
<p>拒絕押款</p>
<p>喧傳本市米業巨擘、近又與銀錢業接洽、要求各行莊恢復米糧押款、查此事前曾提議實行、卒以防止利用押款、實行囤米操縱一節、極難辦理、故而擱置、現値米價高漲、父復舊事重提、用心何在、不難洞悉、聞銀錢業決秉服從國府當局曁財經兩部指示、拒絕米糧及日用必需品押款之嚴峻命令、對米業要求、不予考慮、以防助長投機、</p>
<h3>滬寗路遭遇地雷　昨日火車中斷　錫澄公路日軍用車被毀</h3>
<p>三日晚滬髯路火車一列、在丹陽附近、被華軍所埋地雷失事、業經前日下午日本陸軍發言人在新聞報道席上證實、據記者探悉、失事地點在丹陽與陵口間之七里橋、路軌被炸毀二丈路、燬車頭車廂各一、死司機及乘客多人、京滬車交通卽告斷絕、嗣經日方派路工修復、詛料咋晨七時許、自滬開貨車一列、駛至正儀西外跨塘站附近、又觸華軍預埋地雷爆炸、傾覆車輛多節、死傷多人、致京滬交通、又告中斷、直至下午五時、未聞修復、上行車僅至崑山爲止、又訊、最近錫澄方面、華方游擊隊活躍異常、駐錫日軍蜷伏城內、械爲恐惶、上月二十九日下午四時許、錫澄公路有日軍用車兩輛、亦被華軍地雷所中、當被炸燬、死傷日軍四十餘、同時該公路之二號橋樑、亦被炸燬、現錫滬公路汽車、僅開抵直塘爲終點</p>
<h3>滬候補推檢　優予擢拔　高分院核呈報　陶德駿等俱補實</h3>
<p>本埠兩租界特區法院候補推檢陶德駿等十九人、精通法理、辦事忠貞、在法院內任職經久、據平明社記者昨向法院方面探詢得悉司法行政部對滬各法院甚爲關懷、業已令飭兩租界高分院核　考勤功績具報、經先後遵令呈復、據聞司法行政部此决分發候補推檢、將陶德駿等十九人一律改爲止缺、以符法令、而資奮勉、</p>
<h3>美軍接防中區亟待早日決定　美擁鉅大資產自不讓步　中外居民切盼即予接防</h3>
<p>英國駐滬防軍撤離上海之後、其所遺公共租界中區之英軍防務、按照八月二十五日防軍會議決議、應由美軍接防、惟因日方强烈反對、暫由工部局萬國商團接防、界內中外居民方面、均切望此事早日解決、藉以穩定公共租界地位、平明社記者、曾以此問題向各關係方面探詢、頃悉美日關於接防中區問題之交涉、迄未獲得具體解決辦法、惟悉美當局因在中區中實擁有鉅大產業與權益、自必貫澈初衷、不事退讓、</p>
<p>與華盛頓　密切接觸</p>
<p>赫德七將、自於上月二十五日抵滬以來、先後在美領署及奧古斯泰號旗艦上與美國駐滬車政長官、屢作關於遠東問題之會商、據消息靈通之外人方面所知、赫氏與在滬美國軍長官之會商、以托常在江西路美領署內舉行、現則改在奧古斯泰旗艦上會商、並隨時與華盛頓當局密切聯絡、</p>
<p>美艦離滬　原理係預訂</p>
<p>又美國亞洲艦隊所屬之驅逐艦第二一八號·二一九號·二二二號·二二四號·二三〇號。等五艘、自於上月二十五日隨赫氏由華北來滬後、突於前日上午、先後啟椗離滬、駛往菲律賓度冬、該五美艦之離滬、頗引起社會猜測、但據平明社記者昨向關係方面探詢、此五驅逐艦之離滬駛菲、爲預定計劃、不必驚異、</p>
<h3>倫敦市長　電謝英僑　兩次匯往救濟捐款　四〇六五鎊已收到</h3>
<p>本埠英僑前爲救濟倫敦遭空襲死傷民衆起見、特募集捐款、於上月十一日及本月一日分批彙匯倫敦市長、共計英金叫〇六五鎊、昨已接獲倫教市長來電仲謝、略謂電匯、空襲被災民衆救濟捐款、業已收到、殊深感謝、</p>
<h3>克利扶倫總統號　改於明日進口俄后輪今日抵埠</h3>

<h3>杜絕黑市投機　停售遠期外匯　平準基金會穩定滙市　援權外商各銀行辦理</h3>
<p>自平準外匯基金委員會以其全力穩定法定外匯及維持上海黑市外匯後、外滙價格、始終穩定如恒、自中美二千五百萬美元借款成立後、外匯基金、愈見充實、上海黑市滙率放長、法幣價格、無形提高、今英美各銀行鑒於國際局勢、日趨緊張、變化莫測、爲預防及杜絕投機之計、決定拒絕外滙遠期交易、以及外滙掉期、實行之後、則投機者無法施共技、黑市外滙得以持久穩定、且並不影響正當工商各業、新聲社</p>
<p>投機猖獗　貽害非淺</p>
<p>記者　向經營外滙之銀行探悉、遠期滙票爲上海各滙兌銀行營業之一、例如目前遠期滙票、有十一月期及十二月期、卽是要到十一月及十二月付款之謂、查銀行購買之滙票、有爲非出口貿易之滙票、如依旅行信用證明書發出之即期滙票、及非貿易之逆滙票等、有爲出口貿易之滙票、如跟單押滙　信用滙票等、此項滙票、多屬遠期、因此各滙兌銀行均有遠期滙票之行市、上海外滙黑市因中國政府時權力所不及、以致投機者猖獗、使正當商人蒙受其害、亟應設法嚴予取締、</p>
<p>遠期掉期均予停止</p>
<p>外滙黑市、因投機者　橫、無稽謠言、竟無停止之日　輩投機者缺乏實力、均買賣遠期滙票到期之後、每多轉期、此項轉期、卽　掉期、此種投機、足以影響滙價、及一國之正當貿易、其遺害之深、豈獨投機者個人道德問題已也、故各國均設法阻止外滙投機之活動、惟在此特殊環境之下、上海外滙黑市、竟造成投機空前之猖獗、平準外滙基委會苦心維持黑市、深得友邦人士之欽佩、今英商滙豐·麥加利·美商花旗·大通·等銀行、已商定停止遠期滙票交易、</p>
<p>平準委會　授權辦理</p>
<p>關於英美商各銀行爲穩定上海黑市外滙、會與平準外滙基金委員會通力合作、竭力維持、如遇市塲外滙猛縮時、則由外滙委員會儘量供給、外滙放長時、則由外滙委員會買進、此種滙兌買賣政策、强爲抵抗予投機者之打擊、後來各外商銀行曾停止外滙掉期、旨在减少外滙投機、蓋今日之下、欲滙兌投機之完全消除、確爲事實所不易達、此次之拒絕遠期外匯交易、實為杜絕投機、穩定滙市之惟一良法、似係平準外滙基金委員會授權英美各銀行辦理、</p>
<p>拒售外匯　並無其事</p>
<p>大中社云、臚日本同盟社消息謂、本埠美商銀行將拒售外櫃、以暗中抵制日本商人等語、據本埠外籍之經濟權威解釋、外商銀行近曾限制期貨交易、但各色商人　同一律、絕無歧視日人之處、至日人之傳說、或係別有用意、但本埠滙市、絕未受此項謠言而發生擺動滙率趨鬆、傾塞者衆、</p>
<h3>工部局解釋　滬市積水原因　滬西界外建築破壞陰溝設備　但濬浦局認為浦江失後關係</h3>
<p>據工部局工務處解釋積水原因云、近年本埠往往積水爲患、考其主要原因厥爲滬西界外馬路區域（至鐵道錢爲止）以內、無照建築特多、以致該處陰溝設備、大部份爲之破壞、溝水溢出路面、直至租界陰溝設備之西端爲止、該區直積、等於公共租界之蘇州河南區、則其溢水之廣泛、可以想見、工務處自上年初起、開始設置淸除溝渠機器、用以</p>
<h3>滯留越南貨物　設法運回上哈　華商團體派員前往辦理　港防間航運傳後日恢復</h3>
<p>昨日下午、本埠華商團體舉行會議、事後宣稱、因滇越路被封鎖而滯留越南之貨物、價値數千萬元、將設法運回上海、當時議決、山各商行遺派代表赴海防及西貢、向中國領事當局請求協助設法、將以前原定運往中國內地之貨物、運回上海、據昨日所知、香港與海防間之航運、將於本月八日恢復常態、</p>
<p>清除溝渠</p>
<p>至上年年底、陰溝總樞紐已告肅淸、迄今保持淸潔狀態、查在華北方面、颶風挾大雨俱來者、數見不鮮、在上海則往往颶風來臨、而雨勢不大、惟此决則情形特殊、颶風之來、適當高潮汛期、其時風雨交加、來勢猛烈、歷二十四小時、同時激起江潮、以致造成此决大水、爲一八六五年來所僅見、（積水之深度、比一八六五年的低百分之十、）自本星期一以來、潮漲高過若干馬路者、每日凡兩决、直至本日（星期六）、江潮方有低落之希望、在此種高潮情形之下、馬路積水、不特難望泄洩、抑目</p>
<p>溝水倒灌</p>
<p>唯一通盤處理之辦法、惟有一面將陰溝出路堵塞、一面用幫浦抽去積水、此項辦法、爲法公董局總工程師在數年以前所設計者、如果僅適用於蘇州河以南之兩租界區域、則所費的需一萬萬元左右、且需時十年、方可完全告成也、但據濬浦局水利科、謂此决馬路積水、與潮水雖不無關係、惟並不全由高潮、查浦江歷年高潮、最高紀錄　發</p>
<p>十四英尺</p>
<p>有奇、當時所演水患、並不如現在之嚴重、而歷時亦不若此决之久長、浦江每年失濬、固爲無可吾認之事實、在戰前、浦江歷年浚挖、河床及水流、均有要佳之　步、近三年中浚工曠疏影響潮水漲落、且連日高潮水位、並不若何高漲、雖颶風激揚、水位趨高、但其影響所及、亦祗陰溝之一時冒水而已、非終日不能退落也、</p>
<h3>日大使館發言人　即將去滬　調任新嘉坡領事</h3>

<h3>德義日三國同盟　投機家亦不重視　深知德義不能援助日本　遠東糾紛仍須獨立擔當</h3>
<p>英文金融商業報云、自德義日三國協定成立後、本埠滙市、未受絲　擺動、殊令人玩味、本埠投機份子、向來無中生有、乘風作浪、此决則未能動作、蓋德義兩國對日、不能予以軍事上之援助、人所共知、或有謂三國同盟、可使日本在東亞自由行動、無所顧忌者、此誠愚昧之言、遠東糾紛、日本勢須獨力担當、三年來日本如認爲適合其自身利益、固可完全佔領上海、三國協定成立、對此無所改變其他問題亦然、故簽字國所宜傳之勝利、實際上並無意義、本埠投機家對此協定、床予重視、殆由於此、</p>

<h3>法商工潮談判　又入停滯狀態　昨日勞資雙方未曾唔面　工人復職問題相持甚烈</h3>
<p>法商水電公司工潮、自經法捕房政事部從中調解後、勞資雙方、曾於二日一度談判、未獲有圓滿結果、勞資雙方、本定昨日上午繼續談判、因資方代表缺席、未能舉行、致漸露解決端倪之工潮、再陷僵局、茲據記者探悉、法捕房政事部對於此項工潮、頗爲關懷、昨日下午四時、復召勞方代表、赴政事部垂詢一切、以便覓取解決之最適宜步驟、聞勞方態度、除請求法捕房政事部主持公道及呼籲各界予以同情援助外、並請求公共租界工部局華董虞治卿袁履登及魏廷榮諸氏顧念目前工人生活之困苦、及社會治安之重要、敦促資方從速重開談判、以謀工潮早日解決、而免事擴態大、</p>
<p>雙方相持　癥結所在</p>
<p>法商電車公司工潮、自發生以來、業已旬日、尚　完全解決希望、此中癥結、據社聞社記者探悉、係因勞方提出之各項條件、其中有關於公司開除之工人四十餘名、須一律予以復職、但公司當局、則以開除四十餘工人之事、發生於罷工前若干時日、不得併爲條件、致勞方不滿、工潮解決、又陷僵局、故法商電車工潮之敉平、須待此項開除工人如何解決而解決也、</p>
<p>資方表示　下週解決</p>
<p>據英文大美晚報消息、法租界電車公共汽車罷工、迄今已歷十日、一時尚難解決、據法商電車公司大班法弗萊昨日宣稱、工潮解決、本週恐已無望、須至下週、始有眉目、叉據公司當局與罷工工人間再度談判、現尚未定、同時在商電車公司昨夜又有三雇員被綁、已共達五人之多、其中兩人爲查票、另一人則爲開車、每决發生綁案、皆由手持手槍者五人主持、又稱、法捕房今晨吾認昨日曾有電車被炸、據</p>

<h3>介紹一所美國學校</h3>
<p>炎暑方過，金風送爽，美國一千四百萬莘莘學子，又要重返學校了。波士頓西北一二七英里之處，有一所格羅東學校Groton　School，裹　只收二百八十五個學生。看上去似乎範圍很小，其實名氣大得很。那派肅穆尊嚴的學風，很像英國幾個著名的公學，如伊頓哈羅之流。英國有年代很久的公學，然而最出色的祗有一個伊頓。美國有一萬五千所私立學校，而這格羅東學校便是其中的翹楚。——格羅東學校的創辦人爲皮波狄博士E．Peaobdy。一一年後得諸名人幫助纔設立學校，那時祇有學生一十七人。半世紀以來，這學校的學生雖不多，而聲名鵲起，成爲著名學府之一了。皮博士今年八十三歲，已於上月退休，在學校近旁的村舍中，度其悠閒生活。繼仟校長爲克魯格，年祇四十一歲。母校出身，曾在哈佛及劍僑讀過書。</p>
<p>格魯東的入學年齡爲十一歲至十三歲，再大就不收，因爲學校當局知道，要養成　個優秀的學生，非經過五年或六年的薰陶不可，如果學生年齡過大，那就無能爲力了。一年級生的提度的及高小一年級。入學時須經過品格及學力測騐，每年學費一千四百美元。</p>
<p>新生入學時，祗准帶元錢，此外分文不得帶進學校。因爲學生在校讀書期間，每星期的零用爲二角五分錢，准許他在星期三及星期六兩天下午，在村中遊息一番。一進校鬥，直要到六月中纔能出外。此外，耶穌聖誕節有十九大假期，復活節十七天，平時星　杪都不准出校。</p>
<p>全校的建築物爲三座磚屋，一座石造的禮拜堂，還有健身房，棒球塲，打球　及九十英畝的草地。學生宿舍陳設殊爲簡單，一間六十方呎的房間，有一隻床，一只衣櫃，一隻椅子，和六隻衣鈎。洗盥室中，一長條石製的水檜，每人留出一些地位，放一只錫的面盆，還有三個衣鈎。敎室中各人有一張書桌，四年級生纔有自修室。上午落課休息時候，吃些牛乳或梳打餅干，兩者却不能兼得。新生如果要坐圈臂椅，須視一年來的成績如何爲標準，吾則只好求之於圖書館了</p>
<p>學生在校終年要穿長褲，穿過了一年的長褲便有資格做新生指導，把他一年來的經騐告知新生。告訴他們那幾樣事情做不得，那幾種事件觸犯校规，不過這些老生除了盡指導之貨外，並無特殊權利，更不能欺侮新生。</p>
<p>美國總統羅斯福，國務院决長威爾斯，駐日大使葛魯，主敎馬發德，前總統齊瓦杜。羅斯福，和大富豪摩根的兒子孫子，都是出身於格羅東學校，受過老校長皮波狄博十的耳提面命的。</p>
<p>全校敎師共三十位，差不多每六個學生就有一個學監，他們的權力頗大。學生如有小過，亦必盡量的受責罰。去春，一個　生在吃飯時批評菜肴的好　。被罰於每决吃飯時，吃過道菜後，卽須起立離桌，走到校長面前說上幾句抱歉的話：「我吃得很够，很開心。現在我很抱歉，不得不離座。美味的甜　我無法叨擾了」。</p>
<p>與學生同時進餐的敎師們，如看見自己食桌上的學生「吃相」不好，便叫他立起來，直到大家吃罷飯始已。無故取閙的，罰以一靜默」的處分。在嘴脣沒有開禁以前，被罰的學生不得講一句話。犯過比較利害的，罰以勞作。犯這種過失的學生往往被罰收拾敎窒，割草，掃樹葉或爲敎師們洗汽車，浴犬貓。有一個敎師蓄有一頭老英國產的羊毛狗，專爲供給處分學生們之用的。</p>
<p>格羅東校長皮波狄</p>
<p>犯最大過失的，須受禁錮的處罰，把犯章的學生閉在宿舍最上層的小室裹，每天祗給以水和麵包，還有一本聖經爲伴。處罰的時間爲兩天、不過這種責罰自學校有史以來，祗用過兩次。</p>
<p>除了「斯巴達」式的嚴格敎育之外，格羅東學生又着一寺院式」的枯燥生活。美國普通學校中總看得到女同學，可是這隻學校裹，除了校長家屬或敎師們的太太之外，女性竟是找不出來。最近的女性遠在十五英里之外的康高中學校裹。一年中，祗有華盛頓誕辰前的週末舉行一决跳舞會。只有最高兩級的學生，可以參加。事前山兩級學生各推代表一人，會同敎師，到車站去迎接女生，女生於星期五下午到校，卽寄宿在敎師太太住宅。星期五晚校中演　，星期六夜舉行跳舞會，一到十一時三刻便告停止。男女生交談時間，祗在星期日早晨早餐和做禮拜之間，怱怱一叙而已。</p>
<p>格羅東對於宗敎修養非常注意。星期日不能舉行運動會。除星期日做兩次禮拜小算外，平日上課前做十分鐘禮拜。入晚又須集體祈禱。格羅東雖不禁止信仰別種宗敎的學生入學，但是宗敎修養却是列爲必修課。</p>
<p>一天到晚，格羅東校中鐘聲鏗鏘，不絕於耳。從早上六時五十分起身起，每隔若干時連續不斷的敲打，直到高級生夜間十時就寢爲止。星期日做禮拜之前，八個學生到禮拜堂的鐘樓上，袍繩敲打八隻不同的鐘，至三刻鏡之久。</p>
<p>皮波狄博士自己担任「聖經」課，這一門倒並不是玩的。在這課散下之後，學校空氣便稍見寬弛活潑。敎師和學生之間，也儘多交誼來往，旣可增加雙方感情，又得於敎學之上收事半功倍之效。所以輕鬆的氛圍也常常保持於兩者之間格羅市學生每星期的零用</p>
<p>爲二角五分，前已言之。這倒使所有的學生處於平等。全校有三十個獎學金額，無論普通人家的子弟，與百萬富翁的公子，都一視同仁，和衷無間。大富豪摩根的兩個孫兒今年也進校讀書，他們也月食其力，自己設法賺些零用錢。一個弄了擦皮鞋的行業，每星期可得一元多錢，一個在河邊括船上的舊漆。這事情也很費時。一位敎師很和善的問他道，是不楚覺得太吃力。摩根回答說：　一是呀，但是舊漆每加侖値五角錢呢。」</p>
<p>格雜東雖厲行這種下級經濟建設的精神，但說起來總是一所貴族色彩的學校。差不多畢業生多入仕途，或爲貴顯。卽以總統而論，除羅斯福外尚有柯立芝。而且尚有許多特殊的色彩；像吃夜飯的時候學生都要裝上硬領。上晚課自修時要穿上黑漆皮鞋。</p>
<p>格羅東保持一種良善的學風，淳樸純正，無懈可擊。一决，別的學校當局寫信問格羅東道，爲什麼你們校內沒有學生抽烟或吃酒。回信是「我們這里根本沒有這種問題發生。」又有人問道，如果兩個學生在講堂中高聲談話便怎樣辦。答語是：「他們不會如此的。」</p>
<p>美國駐法大使蒲立德年輕時曾說：「我所知道的格羅東學生，沒有一個不是帶着紳士派的勢利態度。」這話未免過份，而論他們的外表，確免不掉如是的批評。不過就其內容而論，格羅東學校中，畢業生，敎師和學生們，三位一體，好像一個大家庭。這種精神歷久而彌堅，所謂「積厚流光，」頗足以形容之也。</p>
<h3>達加爾的形勢</h3>
<p>美國國務院曾於上月問在法屬菲洲達加爾新設領署，以便隨時監視德方是吾將利用法屬西菲，爲覬覦南美洲及英屬菲洲殖民地之出發點。</p>
<p>達加爾港乃德方從菲洲向南向西伸展勢之最佳策動地，亦法國艦隊在西菲之重要根據地，自南美南菲駛出之法船皆在此港加添燃　。該港海軍設備亦完善，築有堅强砲台及高射砲陣地，兵工廠所，規模甚大。港中目可修理驅逐艦，潛水艇，所貯煤及煤油亦夥。並闢有大飛機塲一處，機庫與修理工塲俱全。法國航察公同所辦南美航空綫以此爲起點。德方飛機現可從德國起飛，經漢國與西班牙屬地，而抵達加爾，藉此載運小隊德軍。從達加爾，渡南大西洋到巴西，不過一千六百哩。</p>
<p>達加爾港非特地位衝要，設備完善，且足爲潛艇根據地，用以襲擊英方主耍航綫。從南美或西菲海岸駛出及繞好望角而行之央船，皆至西菲英屬塞拉，勒窩納之自由鎭（位於達加爾南五百五十哩）停泊，然後由英艦護送，循達加爾　近航錢，駛往英倫。德方若以武力佔據達加爾，用作潛艇及海面輕便襲擊快船之根據地，則英方必須加派軍艦護送，且船隻有受重大損失可能。達加爾之航空根據地，亦爲南攻英屬殖民地之優良出發點。</p>
<p>英國在菲洲殖民地，從未訓練土著軍隊，是其弱點。法國則不然，已在其菲洲屬地訓練大批土著軍，若被德方利用，則後患甚大。</p>
<h3>華北的罌粟</h3>
<p>華北平原粟花今又盛開矣，佔地之廣，遠勝去歲，經北平乘火車出發，憑窗跳望，白色罌粟，觸目皆是，茂盛異常。本年所植罌粟。至少四倍於去年，一說已增十倍之多。</p>
<p>北平與長城之問，魯省東部如晋省中部平原，現皆罌粟遍地，據可靠調查，晉省平原可耕之地，十之一二皆植罌粟，每英畝可得烟膏一百八十兩，其爲害之烈，可以想見。華北凡植罌粟之地，盡亦日方控制區內，游擊隊管轄區則截然相反，晋省游擊隊已令民衆根除所植罌粟，違者重懲，內蒙方面年產烟膏極多，農民近因受驚，紛紛銷毀罌粟，日方卵翼下之機關則不然，見民衆根除罌粟者，每畝罰金五十元。</p>
<p>植毒土地每畝賦稅，在內蒙爲十元，冀省十二元，晋省十五元，地賦低微，目的亦在鼓勵種植罌粟。（譯Christian　Science　Monitor北平電訊）</p>
<h3>英國幾所著名公學</h3>
<p>— L</p>
<p>伊頓，哈羅，溫吉士德，和勒格裴，是英國四個最出名的學校。它們都是公學性質，和私塾不同，而　美國的公學的略相仿。在這叫個學校中，最出色的要算伊頓。創設於一四叫〇年，歷史最久遠，所造就的政界著名人物也放多。不過論其大概，這四校都是英國政治舞台上要人的出產地，而目儘多不同的派別。如果要進這些學校，倒也並非易易。家長每年要化上二百五十磅學費。請求入學的人非常多，往往要等待甚久纔有機會。古色古香的拉丁和希臘文都在必修學程之中。</p>
<p>英國公學保守着許多特殊色彩，每個學校都有一種代表學校標識，顏色不同的領帶，成人畢業生們繫在身上，引以爲榮。此外還有若干奇特的習慣：像哈羅學生總是戴着硬闊邊的草帽，穿着馬甲，行起禮來，舉右手伸食指示敬；伊頓學生平時總要戴上峨冠，穿着燕尾服，一派高貴雍容的態度。他們還玩着一種叫做「牆戲」在最近一百年間，獲得綿標的只有三决！他們穿黑色的衣服，意思是向學校贊助人喬治三世服喪（　於一八二〇年）。逢到六月四日他誕辰時，全校學生又在衣襟上揷上一朶鮮艷的花，以示紀念。伊頓更有一種自創的語言，局外人往往聽不懂的。</p>
<p>伊頓每年收學生一千一百人，哈羅六百五十人；自一八五〇年以來，出身於伊頓的英國首相計共十人。哈羅少四人，計共六人。每個哈羅出身的學生，在校舍木板上雕刻着他自己的姓名。伊頓學生板球戲比賽時，能跑上五十圈的，便在校園中手植一棵樹。大敗拿破侖於滑鐵盧的英國威靈吞公，是伊頓前輩生，他曾在校園中種過一棵樹，有許多人說，威靈呑之所以能獲勝於滑鐵盧者，早就種因於伊頓的操塲上</p>
<p>除了十位首相之外，現在的政治舞台人物出身於伊頓的有艾登和哈立法克斯助爵。英下議院六百十五個議員中，出身於伊頓者估六分之一。比利時王利奧波三世亦會負笈此校</p>
<p>哈羅創立於一五七一年，其中俊佼的學生，現代政治家有首相邱吉爾，陸軍教育總監戈特勛爵，及駐西班牙大使霍爾爵士等。歷史上的著名文學家出身該校的有大詩人擺倫，及小說家高爾斯華綏等。勒格裴的成立年份較哈羅早四年，爲一五六七年。前任首相張伯倫就是此校的畢業生，在他組閣的時候，八個閣員中七個倒是出身該校的。著名敎育小說及電影「桃李盈門」就是脫胎於此。</p>
<p>伊頓學生所繫的領帶墨綠底子，淡湖色細條子，哈羅的黑地雙綫　條；勒格比的深綠底子，黑闊條和細白條相間，比伊頓和哈羅的爲黯。溫吉士德的領帶是朱紅，赫色和深藍一種相開的，非常奪目。這隻學校爲英國各公學中資格最老者，創立於一三九四年，現在有七十個學生，所住的爲十七世紀的校舍，攻讀於維多利亞式的課窒中，眞是古到不能再古的了。</p>
<p>其他較著名的英國公學　有却德好司，成立於一六一年童子軍始創者貝登堡爵士便係此校出身。威斯敏司脫公學始創於一五六一年，爲伊麗沙白皇后所手創，大文學家的翰生就是此校的高材生。育賓亨公學創於一五八四年爲著名主敎及板球戲能手的產手地。拉潑東公學成立於一五五七年，起初是隻文法學校，現有學生三百八十人。著名敎育電影「萬世師表」的背景就是在此攝成</p>

<h3>我們應該仰望上帝</h3>
<p>我們處在現在生活的環境中，無論是耳聞，是目覩，一切的感受，都是不如意事，常居八九。一家不知一家事，大有大難，小有小難，沒有一個人沒有困難。許多人在暗中流淚，以為上帝不刊顧我們。終日垂頭喪氣，這種悲觀的情緒，實在是應該補救。用甚麽方法補救呢？沒有別法，只有抬起頭來，舉目向上，仰望天上的上帝。我們若不舉目向上，仰望上帝，則無論向外看，向內看，都不能振奮我們的精神。因為向外看，我們所看見的，都市些農村破產，商業蕭條，可說沒有一個人不苦，毫無希望。如果向內看呢？，但見本身創痕纍纍，缺陷甚多，也不能提起精神。所以要振奮我們的精神，惟有舉目向上，仰望我們的上帝，若不仰望上帝，則其結果必像現在我們所遇見的，沒有一樣可以使我們快意。上帝使我們所遭遇的，無論何事，沒有一樣不有美意，若不仰望上帝，則惟有灰心，惟有失望。</p>
<p>上帝是賜人力量的，我們若仰望上帝，就必從上帝那裏得著能力，應付一切艱難困苦。世人皆有改變，彼擁資百萬，養尊處優者，曾幾何時便貧無立錐之地了。時為座上客，時為階下囚，富貴尊榮，皆如過眼雲煙，變幻無常。我們倚靠人的權勢，人的力量，希望有一枝之寄，但人的權勢，有時是像冰山一樣的不可靠，人的力量，有時也要窮盡，徒喚何奈。猶太國的詩人說：『我要向山舉目，我的幫助從造天地的耶和華而來。他必不叫擬的腳搖動。保護擬的必不打盹…耶和華要保護擬免受義氣災害…從今直到永遠』（時篇一二一篇）我們也當有這位詩人一樣的信仰，仰望我們的上帝。（十日再登）</p>

<h3>再請大家為兒童造福</h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>讀了王滄萍君的請大家為兒童造福二文後，對於王滄萍君所提出的各種兒童福利事業，我除了抱著同樣的希望當今上海的一般熱心人士能够起來倡導外，再有一項補充。那就是關於兒童們的課外讀物的問題。在八一三戰事前，我們不能吾認這類讀物還可以稱得是豐富，歸商務出版的有一兒童世界」。兒童畫報等，歸中華出版的有「小朋友」。少年周報」等，其他開明有「新少年」，可是自戰事發生後，這些刊物都相繼停刋，直至戰事西移，有一個時期又蓬勃起來了，那時的刊物大概是由幾個小學敎師所合資創辦的，如上海兒童。新兒童·好朋友等，而如申報·中美日報·大晚報·新聞報·文滙報等各大報上亦都每周發行兒童的附刋；到了目前，却呈現了一種空前沉寂的現象，報上的附刋爲了紙價飛漲的緣故，有的是停刋了，有的是把地位縮小了；而定期的刊物呢，是連一本都沒有。不久前，我們還看到一本王人路編的「兒童月刊」，可是出了二期又吿停刊了。這種現象所產生的後果是很可惜的，有的小朋友竟就因此而不知道怎樣來利用課餘的時間，而形成今日孤島街頭的書攤上擁滿着兒童在看那種荒唐無益的小書的情形，亦何嘗不是由於缺乏正當的兒童課外讀物呢！</p>
<p>從這裏，兒童讀物的重要，已是不言而可知的了；所以，我希望還留在上海的作家，文化界及出版界的人士，能够把你們一部分的精力替我們的兒童在這方面造一點福；兒童讀物的銷路，或者是不能與其他的書籍相比的，可是爲了替國家的前途着想，這一切亦是無需再顧及的吧，最後，讓筆者來提出四點編輯兒童讀物時所必須根據的原則，以供大家作爲參考：灌輸兒童時代知識。陶冶兒童活潑情感。培養兒童良好德性。增進兒童生活知能。</p>
<h3>秋天的疾病</h3>
<p>— 蘇明</p>
<p>氣候已由炎熱而轉爲凉快，無疑的，這是秋天到來的徵兆，一到了秋天，疾病便最容易發生，你瞧；報上不是登載着上星期兩租界內死亡了一千多人，而以中國人居多。這段新聞在庸兒的眼中當然是不會逃過的，不錯，秋天確是疾病最猖獗的一季。「那麽爲什麼緣故秋天最易生病？「怎樣才會生病？」這兩個疑問在庸兒的腦海中反應着。在一般小朋友們瞧來，庸兒眞像個傻子，竟能問得出道種幼稚的問題，不過，小朋友們，要是問到了你，可能回答出來嗎？我想，問題雖是很平凡，而它的答案却覺得不平凡了。所以要是一個小朋友能够想得出有意義的問題，倒也是件不容易的事情，而且你們的兄長和老師很高興答覆你們，因此當庸兒把這兩個問題問了宗兒，他哥哥倒很願意的講給他聽：</p>
<p>疾病怎麼會發生？這一個問題很不容易回答，因爲疾病這兩字包括的範圍很大，到底是那一種疾病？什麼傷風，霍亂，瘧疾，痢疾……多至幾千百種，於是各種疾病的特性當然是不同，而各種病的發生也當然都是相異的，不過簡而言之，無論發生什麼疾病，那一定有那一種疾病的細菌在病人體內作祟。要知人的生病，不是一朝一夕的不留心自己身體而會發生，而是在不知不覺中，把病菌源源送入身體中，於是日積月累的，病菌便慢慢地發作了，就是健康的人體中也常有發生疾病的細菌存在着，不過那時我們身體的抵抗力强，使這種病菌被壓服得無聲無息，一旦要是身體的抵抗力减弱了一下，於是病菌又在體內横行不法，抵抗力也敵不過它們，因此那人便生病了。那麼病菌從那裹進入身體的呢？在身體的任何一部，病菌都有乘機侵入的可能，而最普通的是經過鼻和口而入身體，就是病菌混進我們呼吸的空氣，也有混在食物裏，還有從皮膚的傷口侵入，所以在我們的日常生活上要時時小心，謹防病菌的傳入體內那就是要保持身體的淸潔，手要時時洗，食物要選擇些淸潔而煮熱的吃，還有其他各種預防的方法。至於秋天是最易生病，這是什麼緣故？因爲在夏季，晴天是比較來得多，而陽光炎熱很可怕，就是那些病菌對於陽光也具有恐懼之心，而我們常被陽光晒着，便把身體消毒了一下，於是病菌侵入人體的機會較少，而它們便從食物混進我們身體中，這時身體抵抗力還强，所以在夏天便不發作，到一交了秋，秋風秋雨，陽光的咸力便减弱；空氣也較潮濕，這是病菌活動的好機會，要是人體的抵抗力冉一軟弱，於是體內體外的病菌向着人體夾攻，那時人體當然是覺到不支而宜吿屈服，因此只得去請求醫師們把藥品輸入人體，也就是加入了一支打擊病菌的生力軍。不過在現在百物飛漲的當兒，就是連病也生不起了。一</p>
<h3>明日歌</h3>
<p>— 秋郞</p>
<p>諸位小朋友；你們的暑假已滿了，好學的幾位，也許都加入本報的暑斯作業競賽，而於作文，書法，圖畫三項，都做好而交卷了，成績如何？靜待將來發表，做得好的，當然獲得獎勵和榮譽，多麼有興趣的事！但恐有一部分疏懶的小朋友，旣不加入競賽，終日嬸戲爲事，縱使父兄督促溫課或習字，也常要推托稽延，如今日捱到明日，一天天的糊塗過去，此實大妨你們的前程，消磨寳貴的光陰，豈不可惜！筆者偶憶前人有「明日歌」一闋，爲特錄出，以備疏懶的小朋友移作座右銘，深自警悟才是！歌如决：明日復明日，明日何其多，我生待明日，萬事成蹉跎，世人皆被明日誤！朝望水東流，暮看日西墜，一生明日能幾何？請君肥取明日歌。</p>
<h3>飛人的故事</h3>
<p>— 唐亞明</p>
<p>從前在飛幾尙未發明的時候，人門意想假使他門有了翅膀，就能飛翔於高空了。的確，飛機的發明差不多是從這意念而來的。</p>
<p>據說，在古代希臘國中，有一個人和他的兒子確曾裝了翅膀飛翔於空中的。</p>
<p>那人名狄特勒勘，精於手工業，做了很多美而實用的東西，因此就遠近聞名了。</p>
<p>有一决他住在克來脫島上，那時他遭到一很大的苦難，因他遇著島王的仇人，以致他和他的兒子被監禁於一荒島上</p>
<p>後來狄特勒斯想，除以羽毛成翅去裝於他父子二人身上外，無他法可以逃生。於是他就把來裝在他父子的身上，且囑吿他的兒子勿去飛近太陽，於是他們就飛逃而去。</p>
<p>初時的飛行很是順利，但這小孩因快活非凡，就忘了他父親的囑吿，且越飛越高。所以那蠟和羽毛製成的翅膀就被太陽的熱度溶化而分離了，結果這小孩跌入海中了。</p>
<p>最後，狄特勒斯飛達某一城市，且受該地國王的優待。這故事或非眞實，但很是有趣。</p>
<h3>秀蘭鄧波兒自傳</h3>
<p>— 民</p>
<p>希　先生立刻要我們到他的辦公室中去談一下，媽媽就忙着帶我前去。希漢先生和我握了握手，把我抱在他的寫字檯上坐下來，他稱我秀蘭，親熱得什麼似的。他的頭髮已花白了，但他的兩個面頰郤紅紅的，一些兒不覺得芥老。他對我說道：「親愛的，我瞧你不須多久，就會使幾百萬人快樂起來——無論是害病的人，憂悶的人，貧苦的人——就是年老的人，年靑的人，也會得皆大歡喜。總之無論什麼人，見了你沒有不快樂的。」他們都得愛上你，使你變成全世界一個最可愛的小女郞！」</p>
<p>這夜我們僱了一輛汽車坐回家去，這是先前從未有過的事情，因爲車費很貴，我們平時是捨不得的。媽媽非常高與，說我們今晚僱了一輛汽車坐坐，也算是表示慶祝的意思。可甘，我再來吿知一件重要的事；我聽得媽媽和爸爸說，後來我們已簽下了合同哩。那時我因爲還不會寫自己的姓名，所以在合同上簽了一個X字母，你想好玩不好玩？在我剛簽合同的時候，誰也想不到我今天會受人家這樣熱烈的歡迎啊。</p>
<p>我在福克司公司中所工作的第二部影片完成了不久，有一天，攝影塲中有一個孩子來對媽媽說，郵信間中剛送到了幾封信，是人家寄與我的。我們連忙趕到郵信間去，他們就遞於我們一個小小包裹，媽媽和我坐下來，一同拆開來看，那些寫信的人，我們並不相識，而都是瞧過我的影片的。他們信中說了許多甜蜜的話，說他們是何等的歡喜我；有的並且要我的照片，還要我親自在上面簽名哩。</p>
<p>媽媽接得了這些信，又快樂，又很驕傲，因爲這已足以證明人家已開始注意於我了。那些有名的大明星如卓別麟，曼麗畢克馥，珍妮　諾他們，每禮拜都能接到好幾百封信，連米老鼠也是如此。可甘，你知道我如今接到多少信？每天的有一千封呢！</p>
<p>最初來信還不算多，媽媽和爸爸以爲每天用過晚餐以後，儘來得及拆看或作答的；但是不上幾時，他們倆已應付不了到了現在，這件事情，已由我的秘書德祿小姐負責辦理了。媽媽和爸爸間着沒事時，也仍然要來拆看好多封——尤其是那些從中國日本印度等遠方來的。每逢耶穌聖誕節，復活節，和我的生辰四月二十三日，我所接到的信，總比平時多出不少，有的還附帶着一包包的禮物哩。我最喜歡拆看這些包裹，眞個叉驚又喜。包裹裏頭大半是各式各樣的玩偶，或玩偶穿的小衣服，此外我也接到了不少圖書書和關於各種遊戲的書本。</p>

<h3>走進電影院以後</h3>
<p>我們看電影，當然在求身心上的舒適和快樂，有幾點可供讀者作一參考；不過，這完全是我自己的主見而已。</p>
<p>（一）如果你懂得對白的（指西片），拿到了說明書最好不去看它，這樣就會增加許多興趣。</p>
<p>（二）留心不要去坐在有惡習慣人的旁邊！（像任意咳嗆吐痰，高聲談笑等。）</p>
<p>（三）不耍坐得太正。因爲太正了從銀慕上直接反射過來的光綫很容易傷目力。</p>
<p>（四）如果人擠的時候你遲些去，不要以爲中間一定早坐滿了；有時候會意外地給你我到很好的座位呢。</p>
<p>（五）老太太同小伙子坐在一塊：「這是好人還是歹人？」會始終提防你，總以遠避爲是。</p>
<p>（六）別坐在許多同你年齡相仿的異性人旁邊，有時候會使你受窘的！</p>
<p>（七）恐怖片，滑糟片宜坐在人中間；戰爭片，野獸片最好坐得遠一點；艷情片，悲劇片則可以坐在後面。</p>

<h3>遲世恭聲華朗潤</h3>

<p>唱鬚生的，要扮相淸秀，氣度大方，戲路純正，嗓子淸亮，咬字準確，身上瀟灑，現在更新出演的少年鬚生遲世恭，都合乎以上所舉的條件。</p>
<p>世恭是富連成科班新近畢業的一個新角，他在科的時候，已經很有人說他的路子很正，希望很大，出科以後，果然聲華朗潤，一鳴驚人。去年我到北平的時候，世恭正在廣德樓和葉盛章等同台演唱，我聽過他的捉放空城以後，就認定這個角兒，在後起生角中，是最有出息的一個。</p>
<p>這决世恭隨吳素秋南來，正如出　的新刃，光芒萬丈，咄咄逼人，雖然嗓子還沒十分瀏亮，但是很善運用，唱念做打，處處都能恪守著名家的規範，時下所流行的輕薄作風，絕未絲毫沾染，拌　略似楊寶森，但是要雅秀得多，念白腔調，有幾處似富英，有幾處似叔岩，其中以叔岩的成份居多，前幾天他在法門寺劇中所唱的「小傳朋他本是殺人的兇犯……」和駡聲公道是禽獸……」幾句散板，極盡抑揚頓挫之妙，我們在台下閉目靜聽，覺得眞有些像余大賢的味兒呢。</p>
<h3>看了「瀟湘秋雨」</h3>

<p>故事的梗概是這樣：官家的小姐落了難，成了一個貧窮的漁夫的義女，嫁了一個書生。書生進　去趕考，中了頭名，於是利祿薰心，把前期棄如糞土，去了主考官的女兒－岳丈幫忙，做了縣官。前妻去找他（千里尋夫呢！）反而誣良為盜，發配荒島。然而，蒼天有眼，使她在途上逢到分離多年的老父，而且老父已經成了高官，先斬後奏，當然接著就報仇雪恨，從別人手裹把丈夫奪了回來。－父女團圓，夫婦重述舊好。</p>
<p>把大團圓的結局，放在一邊，我們在這影片上看見有有：富豪的專横，官府的貪汚。寫實的所以在導演的靈活的手法下，傳達到我們眼裏時，我們會深深的感動。</p>
<p>至於片子裹的幾個揷曲，那是很動聽的，而陳雲裳在臨江驛門口喝的一個更是充滿了悲憤和怨望，觀衆中因之落淚的不在少數吧！此外像白虹所唱的那一隻，也是冷潮熱駡，其味無窮呢！</p>

<p>許　說：「霍先生，這傢伙吵着要見你——已經有一個多鐘頭了。他說它情願自己供出來，不過要跟你說，所以他一定要見你。我們當然不答應他。知道倪探長回了警廳，才叫我陪了他來。」</p>
<p>霍桑點點頭，問到；「那趙伯雄怎麼樣？那探員搖頭道：「還沒有，倪探長到廳以後就把那傢伙押着。他自己回家去吃飯了，還沒有問哩。」</p>
<p>霍桑把眼光瞧到余甘棠身。余甘棠雖說坐着，實際上上祗擱在椅子的一角，他的上身完全挺直，眼睛裏也露出一種期望和急切的光彩。</p>
<p>霍桑問道：「余先生，你要見我有什麼事？」</p>
<p>那少年忙着答道：「霍先生，你叫我甘棠好了，不敢當。我——我有話跟你說。」</p>
<p>霍桑微笑着應道：「可是關係這件兇案的話？你在驚廳裏爲什麽不肯說？」</p>
<p>余甘棠向許瞅了一眼，才道：「我不願意跟他們說。他們口口聲聲說我打死麗蘭，簡直是誣陷我！他們都是——都是些——」</p>
<p>霍桑預料到這少年以下的措詞，也許會使旁邊的那位探員感覺難堪，忙搶著說道：「你要跟我說什麽？快說，別枝枝節節。」</p>
<p>余甘棠直截答道：「我要吿訴你，我不是兇手，我不曾打死王麗蘭。打死伊的是趙伯雄！」他說這幾句話的時候，聲音很堅決，臉上也有相稱的表示。</p>
<p>霍桑毫無驚異的神氣，仍淡淡地說：「你這話諒必是眞的，不過你得分開講：第一，你先解釋你自己不是兇手。』</p>

<h3>Britain and America Contact the Soviet Union to Discuss Joint Aid to China; Japanese Authorities Threaten America with War; Pittman Says America Will Not Be the Culprit of Appeasement</h3>
<p>London - Reliable sources here reported last night that Britain and the United States are now taking cooperative action to elicit a response from the Soviet Union regarding the military alliance signed between Japan and the Axis powers. It is said that the British and American governments deeply hope that the talks currently underway in Moscow, London, and Washington will lead to joint action by the three countries in the Far East to resist Japan together. Several sources here believe that Stalin is fully aware that the expanded goal of the new tripartite alliance is aimed at the Soviet Union, which was once surrounded by the same alliance. British Foreign Secretary Butler met with Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky at the Foreign Office on Thursday. It is said that the issues they discussed were steps to aid China by the Soviet Union. Previously, Soviet Ambassador Kamensky and U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles had a meeting in Washington, and Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov and U.S. Ambassador Steinhardt also held similar discussions in Moscow. It is reported that the British and American ambassadors have scheduled a joint visit to Molotov this weekend for further discussions. At the same time, British Prime Minister Churchill is said to have decided to announce in the House of Commons next week the British government's decision to open the Burma Road, allowing large quantities of munitions to flow into the Chongqing government. It is reported that sentiment in the House of Commons for aiding China has recently increased dramatically, and plans are underway to send military and economic delegations to Chongqing in the near future to actively implement its planned steps to aid China. (United Press, 5th)</p>
<p>Washington - The White House held a cabinet meeting yesterday that lasted a long time. It is understood that President Roosevelt discussed diplomatic issues with cabinet members, referring to the warnings issued to the United States yesterday by Prime Minister Konoe and Foreign Minister Matsuoka of Japan. (Haitong News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>Washington - U.S. government officials, members of Congress, and administrative leaders expressed great shock at the remarks made yesterday by Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka during an interview with a International News Service reporter in Tokyo, stating that if the United States participates in the European war or insists on maintaining the status quo in the Pacific, Japan will declare war on the United States. Missouri Democrat Clark stated, "Revealing Japan's official intentions towards the United States allows the U.S. to be prepared to deal with future events. The International News Service has rendered a valuable service. Matsuoka's words are truly astonishing. The remarks made by a responsible official of one country to another government not at war can be considered the most belligerent." Clark also stated, "If Japan does not have the assistance of other countries, it would not dare to independently implement its Far East policy." U.S. President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull were very interested in the International News Service report that aroused national sentiment, but neither was willing to make any criticism. (International News Service, 5th)</p>
<p>Honolulu - All reservations for U.S. naval personnel and their families to travel to the Far East on U.S. ships from here and San Francisco have been canceled. Officers of the Asiatic Fleet being transferred to Manila are no longer taking their families with them. Naval authorities have not provided any explanation for this. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Nanjing - After Japan signed the Tripartite Pact, Prime Minister Konoe, in his first statement to reporters, said that if the United States still refuses to express appropriate understanding and sympathy for Japan's position in the East and continues to regard the military alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan as a hostile act, then there is no other way but war. Whether there will be war or peace in the Pacific depends on the extent to which Japan and the United States respect each other's interests in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. Although Japan adheres to the Tripartite Pact, it does not wish to provoke the United States without cause. However, the United States must express appropriate understanding and sympathy for Japan's position in the East as a prerequisite for cooperation. If the United States still refuses to do so and regards this alliance as a hostile act, then there will only be war. Konoe also discussed Japan-Soviet relations in the context of the Tripartite Pact, saying that this pact does not contain any intention of accommodating communism, but he hopes it can reduce the sources of conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union. Japan is now trying to induce the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States to stop aiding Chongqing. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Nanjing - Japanese Prime Minister Konoe issued an article today supplementing his statement of yesterday, saying that the Tripartite Pact naturally implies that if the United States recognizes Japan's leadership in Asia and Germany and Italy's leadership in Europe, then the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy will naturally recognize the United States' leadership in the Western Hemisphere. If the United States does not understand the positions of these three countries and considers the Tripartite Pact a hostile act, provoking the three countries, then Japan, Germany, and Italy are prepared to accept this challenge and fight it out. However, if the United States cooperates with these three countries in building a new world order, then these three countries are willing to work together with the United States. Konoe admitted that diplomatic steps are currently being taken not only to co-opt the Soviet Union but also to induce the United States to end its policy of supporting Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. Konoe stated that the resolution of the Sino-Japanese conflict is now largely being done militarily, but Japan's southward advance is largely economic in nature. Japan's guarantee to French Indochina regarding the stationing of troops in Vietnam under the terms of the local agreement signed on September 22 has now been temporarily reaffirmed with a kind of promise, but this promise is naturally subject to the necessities of military action against China. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka told this agency's reporter yesterday that if the United States participates in the European war or insists on preserving the status quo in the Pacific, Japan will declare war on the United States. This Japanese Foreign Minister, who was educated in the United States, stated at his first press conference since taking office, "If the United States joins the European war, then Japan will be forced to fight its sister country across the Pacific." This Japanese Foreign Minister also said, "I now dare to say one thing to the United States: if the United States is satisfied with recklessness and insists on preserving the status quo, then Japan will inevitably fight it. For us, it is better to be shattered and destroyed than to maintain the status quo." These last two sentences are the first official explanation of the meaning of the Tripartite Pact. Matsuoka also expressed his hope that although the United States is willing to aid Britain, it will carefully consider before plunging the entire world into a fierce catastrophe. From this perspective, it is clear that there must be an explicit provision in the Tripartite Pact that Japan will have to fight if the United States enters the war. Matsuoka also said that Japan keeps its word and will uphold the pact to the end in the name of the nation. "I now frankly state again that the purpose of the Tripartite Pact is to prevent the United States from interfering in the European war. If the United States participates in the war, then the entire world will be plunged into a fierce war of life and death, which everyone fears. We hope to avoid this unavoidable conflict. The Tripartite Pact is an expression of Japan's hope. The American people must know this." Matsuoka expressed great patience towards the United States' attitude and the new U.S. embargo against Japan. Matsuoka said that the embargo is "threatening peace in the Pacific." He also issued a challenge to the United States in clear and unmistakable terms. Matsuoka said, "The United States must recognize the new order in the Far East, otherwise it should be responsible for the war in the Pacific and the world. I have always regarded the United States as my second home. I know that the American people are good and polite people. Today, to know that the United States is the most backward country, insisting on old ideas and trying to hinder those who are trying to improve, is truly heartbreaking. Japan can no longer be restrained. Japan wants to establish a new order of mutual prosperity in East Asia within its sphere of influence and cannot stop suddenly." Matsuoka warned in conclusion, "Japan wants to occupy a place among the world's major powers in establishing a new order for humanity, and this move can never be stopped." (International News Service, 5th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Reports stating that Foreign Minister Matsuoka made remarks to a reporter from a certain foreign news agency, saying that if the United States aids Britain in participating in the European war, then Japan will declare war on the United States, have today been denied by Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma, calling them absolutely groundless. This Matsuoka has never met with that reporter since taking office as Foreign Minister on September 4. However, Matsuoka did meet with a certain contributor to the well-known American weekly "Liberty," at which time Matsuoka discussed the Tripartite Pact and said, "Read the pact and you will know everything." He also said that if the United States aids Britain in participating in the European war, then Japan would have no choice but to fight the United States, but he continued that he did not even dare to think about such an event. Suma also said that the reporter's manuscript was filled with ambiguous and confusing language. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Pittman Criticizes Matsuoka for Misunderstanding American Pacifism</p>
<p>A foreign news agency in New York transmitted a statement by Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka to that agency's reporter, saying that if the United States participates in the European war or insists on maintaining the existing situation in the East, then Japan would have no choice but to declare war on the United States. After this news was transmitted, Senator Pittman criticized it, saying that among the statements issued by diplomatic authorities of a major country in recent years, none has been more astonishing and revealing of belligerent intentions. If the report is not mistaken, then Matsuoka's words are truly unfortunate. Matsuoka opposed the United States' adherence to its position of maintaining the status quo in the Pacific and stated in unmistakable terms that if the United States blindly insists on maintaining the status quo in the Pacific, then Japan will wage war against it. Matsuoka's words indicate that Japan will engage in establishing a new order in East Asia by non-peaceful means. Matsuoka truly misunderstands American pacifism. The United States will certainly take any action that can honorably keep it out of the war, but it will never be the culprit of Munich appeasement. Republican Congressman Fish, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, considered this statement a very important document. Democratic Senator Thomas, who had lived in Japan for many years, said that instability in the Far East has been going on for decades. No one wants to see this situation continue. We want to achieve some understanding and stability. Although U.S. President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull did not discuss Matsuoka's statement, one thing is certain: any threat, whether it comes from Berlin or Tokyo, will have the opposite effect in the United States from what is intended and will instead strengthen the U.S.'s determination to carry out its existing policies. The United States will provide all possible assistance to Britain and its allied countries. In addition, the United States will continue its policy of applying economic pressure to curb aggressor nations. Secretary of State Hull stated today that airplanes ordered by Thailand in the United States will no longer be allowed to be delivered in the future. A batch was delivered in August, but U.S. officials now regard Thailand as a puppet of Japan. Hull paid close attention to the statement from Tokyo by Japanese Prime Minister Konoe that the issue of peace or war in the Pacific depends on the U.S. and Japan respecting and understanding each other's positions. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Washington - Senator and Utah Democrat King William stated last night, in response to Japanese Prime Minister Konoe's remarks in Nanjing, and told reporters, "I do not want Konoe or any other boastful Japanese official to overstep their bounds and decide what our government will do. If our country plans to give Britain moral or material assistance so that that country can resist aggressors and totalitarian dictators, what does that have to do with the Japanese? In my opinion, our policy cannot allow boastful Japanese officials to decide for us." (United Press, 5th)</p>
<p>Japanese Public Opinion Hopes for American Understanding of Japanese Policy</p>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese newspapers today prominently featured Prime Minister Konoe's statement yesterday in Nanjing. However, the headlines of Japanese newspapers do not convey any intention of challenging the United States, only saying that if Washington recognizes the goals of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, then Japan is also willing to restore old friendships with the United States. The United States must currently maintain its friendly relations with Japan and recognize Japan's leadership position in the Far East, as well as the goals of Germany and Italy in Europe and Africa. The Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun stated that Japan deeply hopes to join hands with the United States to maintain world peace. The newspaper continued to warn that if the United States does not change its attitude, it will be forced into a whirlpool of war. The newspaper also pointed out that, up to now, the United States has shown no tendency to change its attitude towards Japan. On the contrary, the country has intensified its pressure on Japan, renewing loans to China and expanding the embargo against Japan, which are examples of this. The newspaper also criticized the United States for previously trying its best to reopen the Burma Road in order to continue providing assistance to the Chongqing government. The newspaper finally believed that the recent proposal to organize a joint Japanese-American committee to study the situation in the Far East is too late to change the American attitude towards Japan.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Axis Powers' Depression</h3>
<p>The intention of the alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan is, simply put, firstly to strike at the opposing countries of China and Britain, and secondly to threaten the United States, forcing it to retreat from difficulties and stop aiding China and Britain. However, based on the developments of the past week, the result seems to be the opposite, because (1) the Chinese authorities have announced a fixed attitude and policy that will never be changed; (2) the British Air Force is becoming more and more valiant in battle, and Germany is gradually abandoning its confidence in winning through air warfare. At the same time, the strengthening of the War Cabinet and the retirement of Chamberlain as Privy Councillor are clear signs of Britain's increasing fighting spirit; (3) the United States' attitude of opposing aggression is becoming more and more distinct. Not only are the attitudes of both the Democratic and Republican parties regarding international policy completely consistent, but even in Congress and public opinion circles, there are even more active proposals for dealing with future threats on both oceans; (4) Furthermore, in terms of the connection between China, Britain, and the United States, it has become increasingly close with the collusion of the Axis powers. Without mentioning that Britain has guaranteed to open the Burma Road as scheduled and the United States has stated that aid to Britain will be extended to Australia and New Zealand, the arrival of the Australian Air Force in Singapore to increase defenses, the widespread rumors in London that Britain will treat China as an allied country, the decision of the U.S.-Canada Joint Defense Board to step up joint defense plans for the Pacific coast, and the proposal by U.S. lawmakers to lease British territories in the Pacific, all of this is sufficient to illustrate the strengthening and expansion of Sino-British-American cooperation. Judging from the above-mentioned signs, it can be seen that the Axis powers' attempt to strike at China and Britain and scare away the United States has completely failed. This is clearly a preliminary setback for the Tripartite Pact.</p>
<p>Although Germany, Italy, and Japan have formed an alliance, they still cannot forget the cheap tactic of "divide and conquer"; therefore, in the alliance, they are still unwilling to openly mix the European war and the Far Eastern war, which is precisely why the three countries are dreaming different dreams and always trying to avoid or delay the confession of "cooperative cooperation." To put it bluntly, Germany and Italy's efforts to win over Japan are by no means intended to help Japan invade China, but are actually intended to encourage Japan to implement a southward advance in order to check Britain and the United States; similarly, Japan's reliance on Germany and Italy is by no means intended to help Germany and Italy defeat Britain, but is merely because the "China Incident" has no way out and the United States' attitude is becoming increasingly tough, so it has no choice but to rely on the power of Germany and Italy, hoping to break the cooperation between China, Britain, and the United States. In such a transaction, undoubtedly, Japan pays the greatest price, while whether Germany and Italy have any gains is fundamentally questionable. As far as Japan is concerned, before forming the alliance, it could still use the guise of "non-intervention policy" to ask Britain and the United States for some small favors. Now that it has cut itself off from Britain and the United States, it should not expect to have any room for trickery; this is the result. On the one hand, there is the danger of losing the American market and suffering a complete blockade, while on the other hand, it is impossible to obtain equal compensation from Germany and Italy: in the future, unless it makes a desperate gamble and aggressively advances southward, it should not expect to find a judgment. However, to advance southward, it must defend the north; to defend the north, it must please the Soviet Union; this is an extremely difficult topic for the Tokyo government. Because, as this newspaper has argued for days, the Soviet Union's understanding of the East Asian war situation is far beyond what the Japanese military can imagine. Moscow will never condone Japan destroying China, taking over the South Seas, and then settling accounts with it itself; the white bear is not as stupid as a pig and will never fail to grasp the small principle of weaving a cocoon around itself and fostering a tumor.</p>
<p>As far as Germany and Italy are concerned, the reason they want to scare off the United States is nothing more than to defeat Britain quickly, but in fact, even if the United States does not fight alongside Britain, the London government under Churchill's leadership may not easily yield. First, Germany's air combat strategy, although it cannot be said to be a complete failure, has at least suffered an unexpected setback; according to the American reports introduced by the former Japanese newspaper's series of articles on the European war, from August 8, when Germany first launched a daytime raid on Britain, to September 16, German aircraft had lost 1,800 planes and 6,000 pilots had been killed or captured, while the British side had lost only more than 600 planes and 290 pilots; moreover, the future climate will be even more unfavorable to the German offensive; the English Channel has only three months of calm seas each year, July, August and September. If we talk about crossing the sea and landing, it is probably more difficult than an air raid; at the same time, Italy's offensive in East Africa has not been very significant recently. Unless the naval situation in the Mediterranean undergoes a dramatic change, making the communication line between the Italian mainland and the East African territories completely free from the threat of the British fleet, the Italian expeditionary force's offensive - at least for the moment - must be particularly cautious. Therefore, for Germany and Italy to win, it seems that relying solely on threatening the United States will be of no avail and they must further open up a way out in the Mediterranean. In other words, they must either find a way to get Spain to participate in the war in order to control the British port of Gibraltar, or they must launch a new adventure in Southeast Europe to change the current strategic situation in the eastern Mediterranean; but as far as the former is concerned, it is highly doubtful whether Spain is willing to "pull chestnuts out of the fire" for Germany and Italy: as far as the latter is concerned, once it involves Southeast Europe, it cannot but take into account the wishes of the Soviet Union. The day before yesterday, shortly after the meeting between the two foreign ministers of Germany and Italy, the two giants themselves personally bothered to meet again, which shows that the two sides have very important issues that need to be discussed urgently. Therefore, in the next few days, the movements of Germany and Italy, especially the relationship between Germany and Italy and the Soviet Union, are the focus of attention.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that the Axis powers each have their own troubles: Japan's difficulty is not knowing how to defend the north and advance to the south, and how to advance to the south without paying a heavy price; Germany and Italy's difficulty is not knowing how to make Britain lose quickly under conditions that do not cause more trouble; these difficulties can eventually be solved, at least for the moment, are extremely depressed and have absolutely no certainty; and it is very possible to get the opposite result.</p>
<h3>Thai Government's Land Demands Rejected by French Government; Both Sides Deny Incidents on the Border; Japanese Aircraft Arrive at Vietnamese Airfields</h3>
<p>Hanoi - French officials have just admitted that no new incidents have occurred on the Thai border and denied accepting new demands from Thailand. The leader of the Thai delegation to Vietnam, Pala Sila, told a United Press reporter that his country only demanded the expansion of the border to natural boundaries and also claimed that his country also demanded Laos province. Ba Shi also said that he did not know of any incidents on the border and that his country would not resort to force. (United Press, 5th)</p>
<p>Vichy - The French government has rejected Thailand's request to adjust the border of French Indochina. Twenty Thai aircraft, followed by thirty, flew over the Mekong River on Tuesday, and Thailand has also increased its border defense forces. However, the French government believes that this demonstration is not serious, but is merely a move to promote land concessions. This move is related to the Thai ambassador to France submitting the land request drafted in Bangkok half a month ago to the French government on Sunday. In its response, the French government merely reiterated its previous views, informing it that France is prepared to implement the agreement established on June 12 allowing Thailand to enter and exit the Mekong River, but does not want to discuss the Vietnamese border issue with Thailand. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Vichy - Japanese troops stationed in Vietnam have been landing in Vietnam since September 26, taking the Haiphong road to Jilong Airfield, where dozens of Japanese aircraft have flown in. It is claimed here that these actions by the Japanese side are merely a normal implementation of part of the Franco-Japanese military agreement signed on September 22. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Hanoi - Former director of the Japanese delegation, Major General Nishihara Ayumi, and the new director, Major General Sumida, visited Vietnamese Governor General Decoux this morning. The former was bidding farewell to Governor Decoux, and the latter was making his first visit after taking office. Governor Decoux immediately presented Major General Nishihara with the Vietnamese Dragon Medal, First Class. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - A Foreign Ministry spokesman announced that a diplomatic delegation led by newly appointed special envoy Matsutomi will soon go to Vietnam to negotiate with French authorities to step up economic cooperation between Japan and Vietnam. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - Vietnamese representatives Yaconi and Conalink went to to negotiate the purchase of arms. After completing their mission, they arrived in Hong Kong on the American Clipper. The French airline company sent a special plane to Hong Kong on the 5th to welcome them. The two will wait for Gossamer to fly over. The British Imperial Airways Hong Kong-Bangkok route, which was suspended due to the tense situation in Vietnam, will resume on the 5th. (4th dispatch)</p>

<h3>US Urgently Needs to Adopt an Active Policy: Stahle, American Talks</h3>
<p>New York: Stahle, publisher of the Shanghai Great American Evening Post, told reporters in New York yesterday that Japan is overvalued by the world. However, Japan's cunning leaders know their strength. Japan is actually a fifth-rate country, and its main weapon is "intimidating bluff." The United States urgently needs to adopt an active policy. If necessary, it should use force to stop Japan's aggression. If Japan believes that the United States is determined and knows that continuing its aggression will lead to war, then Japan will restrain itself, and the United States will not have to fight it. The United States should help China and Britain today, and China and Britain will bear the majority of the war. If the United States hesitates and waits, it will have to fight alone in the future, or even fight against both China and Japan. Stahle continued, although he was ordered to be expelled by the Wang regime, he still plans to return to Shanghai next year. The Wang regime has not received any great support, and a strong and independent China is obviously a necessary condition for the United States' security. (5th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Rumors of Secret Clauses in German-Italian-Japanese Agreement: Far More Important Than What Was Published</h3>
<p>London: A senior responsible diplomat, neither American nor Chinese, but who is very attentive to Far Eastern affairs, recently told a United Press reporter that the German-Italian-Japanese agreement contains secret clauses that are far more important than what was published. The secret clauses include: (1) Germany and Italy promise to use their influence after the war (assuming they win) to help Japan annex the Dutch East Indies and Vietnam; (2) Germany and Italy are prepared to mediate the Sino-Japanese War to achieve a peace favorable to Japan; (3) Germany promises to do its best to engage in diplomatic and political mediation to bring Japan and the Soviet Union to a friendly understanding and to establish a treaty of non-aggression. The above three are all favorable to Japan, but they must be conditional on an extremely important fourth clause. This fourth clause stipulates a date for Japan to join the European War and, at the same time, participate in Germany's intensive attack on Britain's blitzkrieg and the German-Italian joint attack on Egypt and the Near East. It is generally believed that the main purpose of the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini at the Brenner Pass yesterday was to determine the date for the simultaneous implementation of the blitzkrieg by these three powers. It is also generally felt here that if the Burma Road continues to be blocked, it will prompt Chongqing to accept German mediation and lead to a Sino-Japanese peace. However, Britain's decision to reopen the Burma Road on October 17 is due to recent American aid, and British aid to China can also make General Chiang Kai-shek firm in his determination to continue the war of resistance without being subject to German mediation. Far Eastern experts also recall that in the autumn of 1938, the German Ambassador to China engaged in mediating the Sino-Japanese War without success. London and Washington are well aware that the Germans want to bring Japan and the Soviet Union into harmony and bring the Soviet Union closer to the three-power alliance, but many believe that even if Japan and the Soviet Union conclude a treaty of non-aggression, it is not of great importance because: (1) Japan has no interests in the Soviet Union; (2) Moscow has always suspected that the three-party agreement is ultimately aimed at the Soviet Union; (3) Soviet people feel that it is more beneficial to unite with Britain and the United States in the Far East than to conclude an unreliable treaty between Japan, the Soviet Union, and other competing ambitious people.

<p>Berlin: According to an authorized statement issued by the official news agency, a broad hint was made regarding the discussions between the two dictators at the Brenner Pass meeting, stating that the Axis powers are determined to continue their far-sighted policies in the diplomatic and military spheres until the collapse of Britain. The issue of Greater Europe is inextricably linked to Africa, and the Axis powers' decision is based on this goal. (5th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome: According to authoritative sources, Hitler and Mussolini's meeting at the Brenner Pass has finalized the winter military plans for the German army to accelerate its attack on Britain and the Italian army to attack Egypt. Well-informed sources said that the Italian army will soon launch a large-scale offensive against Egypt, and the Germans will also order their troops to land in Britain. At the same time, a total attack on the entire British Empire will also occur. It is also said that Aden and Gibraltar will be attacked simultaneously at that time. During the Brenner Pass meeting, General Keitel, the chief of staff of the German High Command, also attended, which indicates that the meeting must have discussed military technical issues. It is reported that among the issues discussed by the German and Italian leaders and Keitel was the participation of the Italian army in the German army's attack on Britain. The "Massaggero" newspaper stated that the decisions of the German head of state and the Italian prime minister will inevitably lead to resolute steps in the near future. (5th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin: Authoritative sources here declared that Hitler and Mussolini, in their three-hour meeting at the Brenner Pass, have established important military and diplomatic resolutions. German newspapers mentioned the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini at the Brenner Pass on March 18 of this year, when there were various speculations about the outcome of the meeting, but there was soon a manifestation of facts, namely the German spring offensive and Italy's participation in the war. Yesterday's Brenner meeting will also produce equally important results. Dr. Meger, a diplomatic correspondent of the Berlin "Financial Times," which is known for its well-informed sources, declared that the German Chief of Defense Staff Keitel also participated in the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini, implying that Germany and Italy have decided to strengthen the war against Britain, leaving it no room to breathe. (5th Haitian dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin: German newspapers hinted last night that since the meeting between Prime Minister Mussolini and Chancellor Hitler at the Brenner Pass yesterday, "drastic changes" are expected for Britain. The German newspapers also recalled a similar meeting held at the Brenner Pass last spring, which was the prelude to the collapse of France. According to well-informed sources here last night, the main matters discussed at the recent meeting of the leaders of the two Axis powers were the military issues that should be resolved before the start of the general attack on Britain. According to a German official, the German attack on Britain is expected to begin at the same time as the attack on France last spring. In addition, this new offensive policy is to fulfill the conditions of the Three-Power Military Agreement and to open up a road to build a "new order" in Europe, Africa, and Asia. (5th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>London: Hitler and Mussolini's sudden meeting is probably a harbinger of the Axis powers' resumption of the "peace offensive." Some people believe that this is not impossible. Hitler and Mussolini's meeting at the Brenner Pass may be intended to strengthen the Axis powers' superficial unity and use it to continue to intimidate Britain, wanting to make Britain prepare for peace talks. However, regardless of whether the Axis powers will launch a peace offensive, there are several things that can be inferred. Germany has concluded an Axis Agreement with Japan, and there are rumors of seeking cooperation with the Soviet Union to back the German-Italian-Japanese alliance, and there are also plans to induce Spain to join the war. Now, the German-Italian meeting is being held. All of this shows that Germany now realizes that it is in a dead end. Hitler has repeatedly told the world that Germany can defeat Britain on its own, but the war against Britain has now failed, so there is a need to seek allies to help it resume its attack. Just as when a patient's condition worsens, the doctor will suddenly consult and plan a new treatment method that is slightly more intense. The Hitler-Mussolini meeting will inevitably carefully review the Axis powers' war efforts. If the peace offensive fails to materialize, then one of the following four routes will be chosen: (1) Direct invasion of Britain. Although the German General Staff is skeptical of this, Hitler still hopes to give it a try. (2) Direct attack on Gibraltar and North Africa via Spain. (3) The Italian side will launch another major offensive against Egypt, or it will be carried out under German supervision. (4) Advance troops through the Balkans, but the Soviet Union may object to this. There is reason to believe that Hitler is deeply dissatisfied with Mussolini's failure to establish naval hegemony in the Mediterranean, but Mussolini is also easily countered with the fact that Hitler's plan to attack Britain has not been realized.

<p>Germany and Italy Deny Peace Rumors</p>

National officials expect the Axis powers to take diplomatic and military offensives against Britain in the eastern Mediterranean, which will focus on Greece because Greece refuses to cooperate with the Axis powers.

<h3>Spanish Minister of Interior Leaves Italy to Return Home: Foreign Minister Ciano Sees Him Off, Chatting Harmoniously Along the Way</h3>

First, Ciano and Suhner rode in the same car from the Madama Village to the Littorio Airport.

<p>Madrid: Spain is now quietly awaiting the outcome of the Brenner Pass meeting. According to reports from Rome, the meeting has no conspiracy against the neutral countries, but the Rome correspondent of the Spanish Efe News Agency believes that Spain will definitely be mentioned in the meeting. Given the fact that Spanish Minister of Interior Suhner planned to meet with the Italian Foreign Minister before returning to his country, it can be seen that the above speculation is quite reasonable. According to the majority of people in Spain, their attitude towards the war has recently changed greatly. Those who believed that Britain could only support for two or three weeks after the collapse of France have now changed their minds and believe that Britain will be able to achieve final victory.

<h3>American Reporter Observes the Situation in the Far East: After the Reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road, a New Crisis Will Occur</h3>
<p>Washington: Scripps Howard Newspapers reporter Hem recently warned the United States that by reopening the Burma Road, the United States will be drawn into a dangerous situation in the Far East. Hem said that the new crisis in the Far East, which occurred in mid-October and which may lead the United States there, may not be a surprise in Washington. Hem pointed out that this crisis is the result of the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road, because the Japanese will definitely take hostile actions and retaliatory measures against it. According to observers, if this road is reopened, it may easily drag the United States into a dangerous vortex. According to various sources, after the November election, the United States may accept the proposal to lease Singapore for joint use by Britain and the United States. (5th United Press dispatch)</p>

Informed sources say the Coast Guard cutter Campbell will sail to Europe to replace the withdrawn fleet.

<h3>Clouds Obscure the Sky, German Planes Bomb London Again, British Planes Engage, Intense Anti-Aircraft Fire, Numerous Fires Break Out North of the Thames</h3>
<p>London - Last night and this morning, single and small formations of German bombers, hindered by dreaded anti-aircraft fire, hid above the clouds, dropping bombs indiscriminately like rain, causing sixty locations in central London, greater London, and southeastern England to suffer indiscriminate bombing. The most notable feature of the recent German air raids on London is the accuracy with which London's anti-aircraft batteries detect German planes above the clouds. The German planes' movements were constantly hampered by exploding shells. Official sources report that although bombs fell in southeastern England and London, casualties were light in both areas, and material damage was slight elsewhere, with few deaths or injuries. Fires caused by incendiary bombs were quickly extinguished. Yesterday, one German bomber was shot down, making the ratio of German to British losses three to one. It is learned that British bomber squadrons did not sortie last night due to exceptionally poor weather over enemy territory. (Reuter, 5th)</p>
<p>London - An Air Ministry communiqué declared that, according to current information, fifteen German planes have been shot down in today's battles over Britain. (Reuter, 5th)</p>
<p>London - British Spitfire and Hurricane fighters spent the entire day yesterday searching the skies over southeastern England for German bombers that were flying in separately and hiding in the clouds. Although the search was difficult, many German planes were still found, leading to aerial combat. British fighters shot down at least five German bombers, and two were definitely seen to crash. Yesterday morning, a British fighter patrolling the clouds off the coast of East Anglia suddenly spotted a Junkers Ju 88 German bomber 100 yards away. It immediately opened fire, killing the rear gunner, and the German plane dived into the clouds. The British plane followed closely, strafing it three times. The German plane's dive slowed, and the British plane continued to pursue until it saw the German plane crash into the sea. Subsequently, two British fighters pursued a Junkers Ju 88 over the south coast and shot it down into the English Channel. (Reuter, 5th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Today's German military communiqué stated that the German Air Force, under the command of General Sperrle, attacked military installations in and around London yesterday, causing numerous fires north of the Thames and in the northern suburbs.

The explosions were very loud, and smoke filled the air. An airfield near the St. George's Channel was destroyed, and many planes on the ground were damaged. Yesterday and last night, no enemy planes flew into German airspace. Besides an unknown number of enemy planes destroyed on the ground, five enemy planes were lost yesterday, the same number as German losses. (Haitong Press, 5th)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Declares Aid to Britain Policy Will Be Intensified, Exposes German-Italian Plot to Influence U.S. Election, Canadian Pilots to Train in the U.S.</h3>
<p>Washington</p>
<p>President Roosevelt, while receiving journalists yesterday, foreshadowed a greater adjustment of the Anglo-American military standards, and said that Canadian aircraft pilots not affiliated with the Canadian military could be trained in private aviation schools in the United States this winter. When asked if there was reason to believe that Germany and Italy were trying to make him fail in the presidential election, Roosevelt read a news item from Rome in response. According to the Rome news, the Axis powers are now doing everything they can to make Roosevelt lose the election. This is not a plan to interfere in the internal affairs of the United States, but because Roosevelt's foreign policy and his steadfast claims, the Axis powers have no choice but to do so. The Axis powers want to prevent the United States from joining the war and limit American aid to Britain to a minimum. If this goal can be achieved, it will greatly help the Axis powers. That is why the Axis powers must take action before November 5th to greatly affect the election campaign. When asked whether the United States will provide Britain with all kinds of assistance other than war as previously stated, the President replied that everything is being rushed, the sooner the better. It is not accurate to say that Britain is not currently receiving all kinds of assistance except war, but he cannot comment on specific items. When asked about the Japanese report that Secretary of State Hull will resign in the New Year, the President replied that this was just another rumor. The story that U.S. Ambassador to Britain Kennedy will resign and be replaced by U.S. Ambassador to France Bullitt is also the same. (Reuter, 5th)</p>

<h3>Spy Mania in Europe and America</h3>
<p>Regarding the activities of German spies and plainclothes agents in various countries, this newspaper has already translated and published a report by U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox. Here is another translation of reports from an "Atlantic Monthly" European correspondent and U.S. Bureau of Investigation Director Hoover.</p>
<p>Although the Scandinavian countries are known as "democratic nations," the Nazi party is extremely active. The incident of the German transport ship Alma Mack being sunk by a British ship in Norwegian waters was an eye-opener. The fall of Denmark and Norway was really a victory for German spies. Denmark has long been known as a beehive of spies. If one understands that the South Jutland area has 30,000 German minorities due to the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, this situation is not surprising. The Danish authorities have repeatedly warned people not to engage in ship transactions with any foreign nationals, which is really their only way to ensure the safety of ships. Sweden has received special attention from General Göring, whose first wife was Swedish, and he maintains a close relationship with Sweden. Official Swedish reactions or any attempts can hardly escape Göring's notice. Sweden is also filled with Soviet spies everywhere.</p>
<p>Norway is also a country where spies are concentrated, and most of them are active along the coast. Most of them are German consuls, who were still sending coded radio messages until their arrest.</p>
<p>Clues to Norwegian espionage activities have been discovered as far back as 1936. At that time, Major Quisling, as Minister of the Army, used his position to first buy off the Navy, then the Army, and finally police officers and civil servants for his own use. He used this strategy to create cells of Nazi plainclothes agents in Norway.</p>
<p>The Nazi party's youth movement in Norway was initially just a means of enticing others, but it later aroused the suspicion of the Norwegian authorities, who arrested and deported several members. The German embassy immediately issued a statement acknowledging hundreds of tourists, which startled the Norwegians, who dared not interfere any further. In the final stages, the only mistake made by German spies was not sinking the "Blücher," allowing the Norwegian King and government to escape the country. Other than that, the Nazi party's activities were flawless.</p>
<p>The discovery of espionage activities in the Netherlands occurred before the German invasion, when several Dutch military officers and Dutch Nazi secret members were arrested, and the Dutch defense plan was found in their possession, ready to be handed over to Germany. There were a total of 20,000 Dutch Nazis. As for how many Dutch army and police uniforms were smuggled into Germany so that German plainclothes agents could disguise themselves and assist the German army in occupying the Netherlands, it may forever remain a mystery.</p>
<p>The arrests of Hoven, an official of the Dutch Ministry of Social Affairs, and Boof, an official of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, proved that there were also Nazi conspirators in the Dutch government. The two men were accused of providing Germany with information on ships departing from the Netherlands, both domestic and foreign, leading to the sinking of many ships. The names of various countries were also found in Hoven's home, and the reason for this is now very clear. He selected many Germans, trained them, and had them live in neighboring countries in order to maintain contact with the paratroopers. These people were another force in Germany's conquest of neighboring countries.</p>
<p>According to the same plan, several thousand Germans have also moved into Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia is extremely concerned about these people.</p>
<p>German spies in the Netherlands also included women. These women fall into the following categories:</p>
<p>(1) Wives, daughters, and nieces of German residents. The term "nieces" has a particularly broad meaning here.</p>
<p>(2) German women who married Dutch men and still worked enthusiastically for Germany, often persuading their Dutch husbands to become pro-German.</p>
<p>(3) Single women, similar to female students, engaged in commercial activities, working as hotel waitresses, companions, band members, or artists in dance halls.</p>
<p>(4) Serving as maids and housekeepers, most of whom are very capable and highly educated.</p>
<p>These female plainclothes agents all fulfilled the duties of landlords for the German paratroopers. They used signals to indicate aircraft, guided the paratroopers to land, and then contacted them, leading them to important strongholds. They also supplied the paratroopers with various clothing, provided them with various guidance, and supplied them with various information.</p>
<p>The Mata Hari-style female spies of the past are no longer fashionable, and they have been replaced by well-trained, alert, and experienced female spies trained by Hitler.</p>
<p>In the early stages, the Nazi party in Norway used cultural societies, sports clubs, youth leagues, and tourists as cover, and later recruited important figures from civil servants, the legal profession, the church, the news media, and the business community. Politicians were not recruited. Adventurers were also not very welcome, only solid members were recruited. Therefore, the most effective members of the German plainclothes agents were those who were the least noticeable. Among them, the editor of "Free People," Rieffert, currently represents German Propaganda Minister Goebbels as the head of the Oslo press censorship office.</p>
<p>The second phase of the development of the Norwegian plainclothes agents was in 1938. At that time, Nazi spies, disguised as diplomatic counselors, journalists, salespersons, merchants, business managers, lecturers, refugees, exiles, etc., sneaked into Norway to carry out activities. These people had to be welcomed in society and have a position in their profession. Among them, Major Spindler served as an attendant to King Haakon of Norway. After these spies penetrated Norway, they united with local plainclothes agents under the protection of the German consulate. They worked together in strict secrecy, initially with only a few hundred people, and later with several thousand, conspiring to rebel. German spies who leaked secrets were executed, so most of those Germans were people who did not drink alcohol and could keep their mouths shut.</p>
<p>The third phase was in the six weeks before the actual German occupation of Norway. At that time, a large number of young German travelers poured into Norway and searched for the names of the other twenty co-conspirators who held high positions.</p>
<p>Before the Netherlands was invaded, it did not carry out large-scale espionage eradication work. The Dutch Communist Party was more powerful than the Norwegian Communist Party. The Dutch Nazi leader, Marcel, was also more important than Norway's Quisling. Although the Netherlands had implemented martial law a few weeks before the invasion and subsequently rounded up spies, in reality, those arrested were only a drop in the bucket. The exact number of German plainclothes agents is unknown, but it can be asserted that there were at least 20,000 members of the Dutch Nazi party, not counting an equal number of German expatriates.</p>
<p>The job of these plainclothes agents was to spread rumors throughout the country that Britain and France would violate the neutrality of the Netherlands. Marcel used the excuse that every Dutchman should have freedom of speech or writing, and continued to act freely without being arrested. Before the German invasion, these plainclothes agents did not even lift a finger. The fall of the Netherlands has proven to be the result of the entire country being filled with German plainclothes agents. Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens once said that two days before the German invasion, an important banker in Amsterdam was searched, and the entire plan of the Dutch government to flood the entire country by digging dikes was found. The truth has now been revealed that the person who directed the plainclothes agents to defeat the Netherlands was a little-known counselor in the German embassy named Düding.</p>
<p>Hitler's relocation of Germans to neighboring countries and the large number of Nazi spies active in Belgium had already caused a serious conflict between King Leopold of Belgium and the Belgian Nazi Rexist Party before the German invasion. The Belgian Nazi Party had at one time made a special effort to win over Belgian military officers. Therefore, a Captain Tombalay in the Belgian military informed German spies of the entire Belgian defense plan.</p>
<p>The Rexist Party made every effort to hinder the Allied forces. Zembello, who was arrested in Chabro, was the leader of the spies in that area, and was entirely responsible for spying on the British and French forces on the Belgian border for Germany, often providing the information he obtained to German mobile spies.</p>
<p>Although King Leopold of Belgium tried his best to maintain neutrality, the Lexkist Party tried to drag Belgium into the war. Before the German invasion, Belgium did not have strict preventive measures, but several effective actions were also taken, such as establishing concentration camps to detain Lexkist Party members, communists, and German refugees. The management of these concentration camps and the prisoners inside was very special. German Catholic refugees were managed by the Belgian Catholic Party, German Socialists were managed by the Belgian Socialist Party, and German-Austrian Jews were managed by various Belgian Jewish groups. After the outbreak of war, Belgium immediately encountered the problem of 400,000 foreigners residing within its borders, accounting for five percent of the country's total population.

<h3>Food: No Problem for Foreign Rice to Arrive in Shanghai, Rice from Hong Kong Continues to Arrive, Foreign Rice Prices in the City Fall Again, New Early Rice Arrives Vigorously, Kiln Rice Also Seen New</h3>
<p>After the rice market showed a fluctuating situation the previous morning, yesterday, the arrival of new early rice via rickshaws continued and a large number of river boats arrived, not less than 4,000 piculs. In addition, new early kiln rice from Qingjiao also made its first appearance on the market, not less than 150 piculs, causing an oversupply of new goods and a large and significant drop in prices, falling by as much as four or five yuan. The new early rice opened at 76 yuan, Taicang mutton tip at 62-63 yuan, Qingjiao du tip at 66 yuan, and then to 64.5 yuan. However, the opening price of kiln rice was comparatively higher at 88 yuan. The prices of other thick or thin and broken rice fell by two or three yuan without exception. Changbang early rice was only 90 yuan, Su early rice 87-88 yuan, and Nangang early rice 88.7 and 88.5 yuan. Glutinous rice also fell by one or two yuan, Jinli special at 72 yuan, and Changdan goods at 71 and 70 yuan, similar to Hong Kong glutinous rice. Foreign rice, therefore, struggled weakly. General floating traders massively released their goods, and all prices fell by one yuan. No. 1 Saigon was 73 yuan, No. 2 67 yuan, No. 2 Siamese 65 yuan, small wring 64.5 and 64 yuan, and the early market once plunged sharply, with the lowest price for small wring being only 63.2 yuan and No. 2 early rice at 64 yuan. However, the overseas quoted price for Saigon No. 2 telegram was still around 79.5 yuan, and importers were afraid that the Shanghai market would be too small and did not dare to ask. Some firms absorbed the rice because the overseas price was not small and few new orders had been placed. Therefore, the afternoon market turned around, and afternoon saw a recovery of five or six corners. Anglo-China Corporation original packages were returned to the market because the goods owner believed that the overseas price was high and the cost was not low, so they insisted on throwing out the goods at the original plate of the previous day. Importers thought the price was too high, so no original packages were sold all day. It is estimated that more than 4,000 packages of foreign rice are on offer.</p>
<p>The arrival of foreign rice in Shanghai is very vigorous. The arrival dates have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the Danish ship Heinrich Jessen, managed by the Jardine Matheson Company, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (4th) with 4,576 packages from Hong Kong and stopped at the Jardine Matheson Wharf in Pudong to unload. Yesterday, the company's Jiangsu ship arrived in port, carrying 6,791 packages from Hong Kong. In addition, the Taiyuan ship also loaded 7,059 packages from Hong Kong and stopped at the company's warehouse in Pudong to unload. It is said that a large batch of foreign rice is waiting to be loaded in Saigon to be shipped to Shanghai. It is said that although Japanese troops have entered Vietnam, the Japanese army has no right to interfere with commerce, so there is no problem for foreign rice to arrive in Shanghai. (Zu)</p>
<h3>Authorities Prevent Price Hikes, Current Factory Prices Still Fixed</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's market was secretly tight as usual. Since Hua Factory flour has been actively sold to customers, the supply to this market has been decreasing day by day, and the factories have been increasing the prices. The authorities have prevented price hikes, so the factories have continued to maintain the original prices for the time being and have not increased them. However, the retail flour shops in this market all have limited supplies from the factories, and most have no goods to sell. The old brand name warehouse receipts have secretly hardened by one or two corners. The quoted price for foreign flour is slightly higher than before, with the total price being 17.23 yuan. A large amount of foreign flour is awaiting arrival, and people's hearts have not yet declined, so foreign flours such as Pagoda Double Eagle brand are still selling for 18.5 yuan, comparable to the customer price of Hua flour. It is said that customer sales are continuing to move slightly.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's market did not make any progress. There are nearly 1,000 packages of goods arriving by truck every day, but they are all designated for delivery to Japanese factories. The receiving price is still only around 21 yuan. Hua factories and other sales channels have no goods to receive at all, so the market has returned to calmness.</p>
<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Supply and Demand Adequately Offset</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in the HSBC exchange rates. The unofficial market for the British and American currencies was exceptionally stable, with minimal fluctuations. Speculators continued to maintain a long-term outlook, focusing on selling rather than buying. However, major foreign banks like the Chinese banks and American banks showed strong demand, initially balancing supply and demand. At noon, news spread that the United States would withdraw Far East oil merchants, a move related to Japan. Speculators interpreted this as negative news, leading to increased selling. Consequently, the US dollar traded actively at 5.5625 yuan. However, by the afternoon close, prices had recovered to level. The British gold closed at 3 pence and 5.5625 shillings, and the US dollar closed at 5.53125 yuan, showing no significant change from the previous evening close for either currency. The market was closed on Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>Negative News Persists</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London exchange rate was significantly lower, nearly falling by 0.0625. The silver price in New York remained stable. The London gold price was steady. The exchange rates between the British pound and the US dollar, as well as Shanghai currency, were stable. The US dollar exchange rate was slightly higher against the British pound and slightly lower against Shanghai currency. There was no market for the French franc. The central bank's exchange rates remained unchanged. At the opening of the bank's spot market, the selling price for British gold was 3 pence and 5.5625 shillings, and the US dollar was 5.53125 yuan, showing no change from the previous day's close for both currencies.

At the same time, HSBC bought Shanghai spot US dollars from Chinese banks, also at 5.53125 yuan. The HSBC exchange rates were announced and remained unchanged. The silver balancing tax was also announced with no changes. Subsequently, Chinese banks and speculators sold aggressively, causing the market to harden and some negative rumors to circulate. Shanghai foreign banks sold US dollars for this month at 5.53125 yuan, and speculators sold US dollars for this month to foreign banks at 5.5625 yuan. They also sold US dollars for the next month to HSBC, American banks, and overseas Chinese banks at 5.53125 yuan and 5.5625 yuan. By the afternoon close, the trend had turned stable. The spot price for British and American currencies for this month was 3 pence and 5.5625 shillings, and for the next month, it was 3 pence and 5.546875 shillings. Both spot and futures for the US dollar were at 5.53125 yuan. Compared to the closing price from the previous day, the British and American currencies were unchanged. The market was closed on Saturday afternoon.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Unpredictable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold price in the unofficial market started well but briefly broke below 5,800 yuan mid-day. Market sentiment was lukewarm because the exchange rate fluctuated only slightly and there were negative rumors. This made it difficult to raise interest in gold. The subsequent rebound in prices was due to short covering at low prices. The closing price was 5,830 yuan, a slight increase of 12 yuan compared to the previous day. The trend was similar to the previous day. The market was closed on Saturday afternoon. The external market was firm initially, then stable. Trading volume was relatively strong for half a day, estimated at around 2,500 taels. Silver jewelry remained unchanged. Customs gold and other items were stable.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Rises by 12 Yuan</p>
<p>In the early morning, the exchange rate was stable, and operators still had demand. Gold firms took in 20 taels from securities firms at the opening price of 5,865 yuan. Shortly after, gold and silver firms were eager to buy, raising the price by more than 10 yuan. Gold firms paid money exchange companies 30 taels at 5,875 yuan. Subsequently, gold firms sold 10 taels to silver firms at 5,865 yuan. At that time, retail investors suddenly became interested in buying, pushing the price to the edge of the 900 yuan level. Silver firms traded 10 taels at 5,885 yuan. However, securities firms and short sellers sold aggressively, causing the price to fall. Securities firms sold 20 taels to gold firms at 5,840 yuan. Gold firms then bought 20 taels from silver firms, raising the price back to 5,855 yuan. Finally, money exchange companies, securities firms, gold firms, and others jointly sold, causing the price to drop below the 800 yuan level. Money exchange companies sold 20 taels to gold firms at the low price of 5,790 yuan. Later, due to short covering, gold firms recovered, raising the price again. Silver firms took in 10 taels from securities firms at the afternoon closing price of 5,830 yuan. The market was closed on Saturday afternoon. In the external market, the price was initially 5,850 yuan, and there was some trading. The last price heard was around 5,830 yuan, a decrease of 12 yuan from the previous day. The selling price of spot gold from gold firms was more than 10 yuan higher than spot gold, and the buying price was 30 yuan lower. The current benchmark gold price was 50 yuan lower than the listed price, and there was little trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Still Listed at 600 Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael in silver jewelry stores remained unchanged. Dah Tong Hang listed at 600 yuan, and the prices at Xin Tong Hang were similar to the previous price. The buying price was about 30 yuan lower.</p>
<p>Japanese and Korean Banknotes Continue to Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw spot gold fluctuate, so the rise of the British pound was like a fleeting flower. It eventually fell slightly by 0.5 yuan. The supply and demand for British gold banknotes were balanced, and the market price remained stable. The evening market remained at the original price of 58 yuan. The US dollar banknote fluctuated, but eventually stabilized. The supply and demand for Hong Kong banknotes were equal, and the market price remained stable. There were many sellers of Japanese and Korean banknotes, and the market price continued to decline. The former fell to 1.44 yuan, and the latter fell to 1.14 yuan.</p>
<h3>Financial Commentary by Sheng Kaiqiong</h3>
<p>October 5th, A Word to the Financial Industry</p>
<p>Since the Zhejiang Industrial Bank first announced a reduction in interest rates on current deposits, followed by the Shanghai Bank, and then the China &amp; South Sea Bank, Kincheng Banking Corporation, the Yieh Chih Commercial Bank, the Continental Bank, and their joint savings association, it can be said that Shanghai's major commercial savings banks have all implemented lower interest rates on current deposits. Other commercial savings banks are either observing, discussing, or planning, and implementation is not a question. If it is profitable to use funds for speculation, it may be delayed. If it is not profitable, then interest rates can be reduced, since there is an example to follow and it is not too late.</p>
<p>The reasons for these bank's interest rate reductions are: (1) High prices and huge bank expenses make it difficult to profit from the difference between deposit and loan interest rates and handling fees. (2) Bank loans are difficult to use because there are no safe and reliable borrowers. It is also dangerous to engage in foreign exchange speculation. Therefore, receiving deposits is simply incurring interest expenses. (3) Since the implementation of the stable financial measures, the limitation on Shanghai withdrawals and deposits by the Malu Electric Light Company, depositors only seek convenience and do not care about the amount of interest. They are transferring deposits to current accounts or even to foreign banks without interest. In fact, depositors no longer care about the presence or absence of interest, let alone the amount of interest.</p>
<p>Regarding this issue, I once wrote about "Interest Rate Reductions and the Inward Transfer of Funds" in the previous financial commentary to Shanghai's banking industry. Now that several banks have begun to implement it, I feel that the meaning is not exhausted. I am not afraid to speak frankly and will make another statement to Shanghai's financial industry.</p>
<p>Assuming that my analysis of the reasons for interest rate reductions is accurate, and the financial industry believes that these three reasons are 100% correct, then I do not want to say more about the first and third points. However, I have some comments on the second point. Although it is a fact that bank deposits have increased and loans are difficult to make, we should recognize that the increase in deposits did not begin in 1929, and the difficulty in making loans did not begin in 1929 either. Let us examine the balance sheets of the major commercial savings banks that have reduced interest rates. Since 1926, except for 1926 when deposits decreased due to the war, they have increased significantly since 1927, far exceeding the record of 1925. Although the trend of increasing current and fixed deposits has differed, with fixed deposits being slower and current deposits being faster, banks certainly did not realize this only this year. They should have felt it as early as 1927. Why did the banks not reduce interest rates in 1927, 1928, or even the beginning of 1929, but only in the second half of 1929? As for the difficulty in making loans and the difficulty in using funds, the business records show that mortgage loans have neither increased nor decreased, investments in securities have not increased, and interbank deposits have greatly increased. The investment return on government securities is more than 1%, so why not invest in public bonds if mortgage loans have no outlet, but instead accumulate funds in interbank loans? In fact, some banks have purchased large amounts of foreign exchange since the outbreak of the war, and some banks have deposits of more than 10 million in the British HSBC Bank. Who would believe that Shanghai's banking industry is not speculating in the foreign exchange market! In the past, although banks felt that deposits were increasing and loans were difficult to make, foreign exchange speculation could yield multiple times the profits, so deposits increased, but interest rates were not reduced in 1927, 1928, or the beginning of 1929, but only in October in the second half of 1929.</p>
<p>There are also objective reasons why banks have recently started to reduce interest rates. Since the sudden contraction of the foreign exchange market on May 2, speculators believed that the value of the legal currency would continue to fall. Unexpectedly, after May 10, the European war expanded, the British and French military were at a disadvantage, and the German army invaded Holland and Belgium. A run on deposits occurred in Shanghai's foreign banks. In order to cope with this, a large amount of foreign exchange was sold off, and a very large selling trend occurred in the foreign exchange market. The exchange rate gradually became looser, with the British pound rising from 3 pence and a half to outside 4 pence, and the US dollar rising from 4.71875 yuan to above 5.5 yuan. The US dollar even rose above 6 yuan at the end of June. Although speculators took advantage of the revision of commercial exchange rates and the tension in Vietnam in August and September to engage in buying, the power of their influence on the market had become exhausted. Although the exchange rate was slightly tighter, the tightness was very slow. Furthermore, the difference between the current and near-term prices was not much, so there was no profit to be made from speculative arbitrage. This is one reason. At present, the world is changing rapidly, and both Eastern and Western powers cannot stay out of it. Therefore, the currency value of any country has the risk of falling. Therefore, the foundation of the legal currency is definitely not as strong as the currency foundation of any country. Except for the possibility of a short-term commercial imbalance in supply and demand or the speculative use of the situation to tighten or loosen the currency, the legal currency itself has no possibility of falling. This is the second reason. Then, instead of turning deposits into foreign exchange there, or depositing large amounts of money in foreign banks at no profit, and suffering interest losses (this is the real waste of interest), it is better to find another way out. However, the mentality of bankers is different from that of the public. It is said that a certain bank's funds in HSBC Bank have not been touched, and after the interest rate reduction, it only saves 200,000 yuan in interest expenses per year. However, a certain bank is unwilling to transfer 10 million yuan to the national bank to earn 2% interest of 200,000 yuan. It is still looking forward to the speculative profits of foreign exchange and would rather suffer interest losses and transfer this loss to depositors. On the surface, it says that bank expenses are huge and that interest rates must be reduced to prepare for its own expenses! From this one line, from this one thing, the rest can be inferred.</p>
<p>I am not deliberately saying that the banking industry's interest rate reduction is inappropriate at this time and place. I hope that Shanghai's financial industry can think carefully about how much contribution it has made to the war of resistance and national construction in this great era of resistance against Japan, whether it is more beneficial to the country or more harmful to the country, and not to focus on the calculation of profit and loss, but to actively do what I said in "Interest Rate Reduction and the Inward Transfer of Funds"! (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Rises Slightly, Still Dependent on Changes in the Situation</h3>
<p>The unofficial market for securities rose slightly yesterday, as I unfortunately predicted. Those who have been in this business for a long time can tell that this trend is a necessary path for a large rise and a small retracement, but it will definitely not cause a decline. Therefore, the price quickly rebounded after the fall. With the continuous and widespread absorption by the silver and money industries, many selling orders emerged, but they were still bought up by buyers. Therefore, the prospect is for continued upward movement. A grade securities at 60 yuan is just around the corner. Since the situation in Myanmar has changed, the Yunnan-Burma Road has hope of opening as scheduled. Therefore, the United States and the United Kingdom have shown blatant support, indicating that China is gradually in a favorable position. However, on the other hand, the actual situation in Shanghai cannot be ignored. If they reach the end of their rope, they may resort to reactionary measures. Like dawn breaking, with the sky hazy, some shocks are unavoidable. Therefore, the future changes in the debt market still depend on the situation. However, in the end, there will definitely be good luck. Yesterday morning, Xinfu and Hongda, the large buyers, sold off nearly one million securities in large quantities. Xinchang, Lianhe, and others also sold very actively. Most of them were bought by the silver and money industries. The market price only fell by a small amount of 0.5 to 0.6 yuan. In the afternoon, the buying sentiment suddenly became strong. Hongda bought back significant quantities from Yiji, Lianyi, Lemao, and Defu. The market situation recovered from low to high. Xinfu had stopped selling. Hengfu, Xinchang, Lianhe, Shuntai, and others sold off slightly. However, large short positions have not yet been covered. Yesterday's results, except for grade D securities, which were up 0.05 yuan, the rest recovered by a small amount of 0.15 to 0.55 yuan. The transaction volume was 2 million yuan. A simplified table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 500 shares of Chinese-owned electric company stock were traded at 6.5 yuan per share, up another 0.05 yuan. London market prices were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Textiles: New Speculators Active, Cotton Cloth Prices Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: Yesterday's rise intensified. Because actual sales were not strong and sellers took the opportunity to sell off, the rise lagged far behind. This attracted the buying interest of new speculators, and the volume of transactions gradually expanded. However, the price differences for various cloths were huge, ranging from 0.1 to 1 yuan or more. Fine cloth, fine twill, serge, direct tribute cloth, and others rose by about 1 yuan. Coarse cloth, coarse twill, and others rose by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan. About 2,600 pieces were traded in the market. Demand from merchants was weak. Jardine Matheson opened 2,000 pieces of coarse cloth for October and November.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: The rise continued to intensify. Fine cloth and fine twill rose another 0.7 to 0.8 yuan per piece. Serge rose by 0.04 yuan per yard. Because the price of raw yarn was rising at the opening, the cloth market was very chaotic. The highest price for fine cloth once reached 37.55 yuan. Mid-day, those who profited sold off, bringing the price back down to 36.85 yuan. Because there were not many spot lots available, speculators gathered, and the market rise started again in the afternoon, reaching a high price of 37.45 yuan. At the close, some short-term speculators sold off, pushing the price down to 37.2 yuan, but the market sentiment remained very strong. Four Gentlemen serge closed at 1.115 yuan per yard.</p>
<p>Exports: Three pieces of textiles were shipped to Hong Kong today, and 175 pieces were shipped to Siam.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton: Asking Prices Too High, Cotton Market Deadlocked, Prices Up 20-30 Yuan in Recent Days</p>
<p>Spot cotton transactions have become less active, and the transaction volume is much lower than the previous day. This is because the yarn market has risen again and again, and the rise in the cotton market, which has been depressed for a long time, is far out of proportion to the yarn market. Therefore, sellers are not satisfied. However, because asking prices are too high, factories are still unwilling to stock up, resulting in a deadlock. Fine cotton, 30.00 guarantee of abundance, 96 pieces taken in by Jinfeng</p>
<p>The above is the factory price: Rangoon 181.00, 400 pieces taken in by Shenghe, another 185.00, another 400 pieces.</p>
<p>Pula 209.00, 200 pieces taken in by Jifeng. Fine cotton, 30.00, 31 pieces taken in by Chengde</p>
<p>Also, a report on the foreign cotton market price: New York cotton market, the market situation is firm, and then it rose due to the short covering of some short positions. As a result, the closing price was up 2-3 points for the near term and 8-10 points for the long term compared to the previous day. India, including forecasts, rose by half a rupee.</p>
<p>The foreign cotton transaction in Shanghai has been very active in recent days. All parties believe that the inventory in Shanghai is decreasing day by day, that the transportation of foreign cotton to Shanghai is difficult, and that the selling price in Shanghai is actually lower than overseas. Therefore, factories and fellow merchants are competing to buy, and prices have risen sharply. In recent days, the price has risen by a huge amount of 20-30 yuan. According to this trend, there is a risk of cotton shortage in the future.</p>
<h3>Large Speculators Sell Off, Cotton Yarn Prices Rise and Fall Wildly</h3>
<p>The recent yarn market has been going up and down, but the trend is very strong. This is because there is still continued demand for 10-count coarse yarn from Hong Kong. At the same time, speculators are spreading rumors that raw cotton is being blocked and that the source is difficult to obtain, and they are uniformly bullish on cotton yarn. Therefore, they are fueling the flames, and people's hearts are like hair. However, looking back at the panic on June 28, the market plummeted to 800 yuan, and no one dared to accept it. It is now at 1,200 yuan. However, the inventory of yarn is still above 300,000 bales. Once the excitement is over, there is a danger of repeating the previous mistakes. Today, 70 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong and 355 pieces were shipped to Siam.</p>
<p>The opening price of 20-count Double Horse yarn this morning was extremely enthusiastic, at 1,187 yuan, up 20 yuan from the previous day's closing price. However, the buying trend was like a tide, and the price rose to 1,218 yuan in an instant. Some people said it reached 1,220 yuan. At this time, those who were buying on the market were as hot as fire, and many said that a certain yarn had reached the limit. Unexpectedly, large speculators took advantage of the chaos and suddenly sold off, falling to below 1,180 yuan in a moment. Finally, because buyers were still firm, it rose again to above 1,200 yuan. After the close, it fell slightly by 10 yuan to 1,190 yuan. According to the statistics of transactions in half a day, 5,955 bales were traded. The price of 20-count yarn rose by 18 yuan. The amount bought by each company is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Fellow merchants 4,900, Hong Kong 1,035, Fujian 20, Total 5,955</p>
<p>Oil Market: Manipulating Crude Oil Without End, Selling Price Soars by 5-6 Yuan</p>
<p>The edible oil market situation is driven by two factors: first, sales channels have not been cut off in various markets; and second, the environment is conducive. The upward potential should not be underestimated. The market has changed from a gentle increase of 1-2 yuan to an uncontrolled surge. Speculators were all delighted. Yesterday, soybean oil only rose by 2 yuan because trading between the two parties was limited and could not be expanded. However, the quantity of peanut oil available at the docks was sufficient for manipulation, so speculators were unscrupulous, and the "rubber ball" trading was wanton. The market price rose linearly. As a result, both spot and futures oil soared by 5-6 yuan. 400 pieces of Jiaozhou crude oil were traded at 80 yuan to 82.25 yuan. 100 pieces for October delivery were traded at 80.075 yuan to 82.25 yuan. 2,500-2,600 pieces for late October delivery were traded at 80.075 yuan to 84 yuan. 80 barrels of Qingdao crude oil were traded at 110 yuan. 50 barrels for October delivery were traded at 109.5 yuan. 600 barrels for late October delivery were traded at 110 yuan to 112.5 yuan. 300 tins of Yantai refined oil were traded at 105 yuan. 200 pieces of Jiaozhou road soybean oil were traded at 84 yuan. More than 500 dan of Dayaoyu factory soybean oil were traded at 94.5 yuan to 95 yuan. The price of old warehouse orders was 92.5 yuan to 93 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Japanese Merchants Buy Coarse White Sugar</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend remained soft, with a slight continued decline. The association's listed price for spot 24 coarse white sugar was 78.5 yuan at the local warehouse, and 77.5 yuan at the foreign warehouse for July arrivals. Japanese merchants bought 500 bags, and the transshipment price remained unchanged at 61.5 yuan. Dutch cotton white BA grade also showed a loosening trend, with an asking price of 74.5 yuan, but no transactions. Dutch red remained at 59.6 yuan. Taikoo brand B grade sugar was 75.5 yuan, and DY grade sugar was 73.3 yuan, both down a slight amount. HX grade sugar was 73 yuan, down a slight amount. HHM grade sugar was 67 yuan. Yesterday, 11,700 bags of sugar arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Metals, Lead and Iron Transactions Continue</h3>
<p>The lead and iron market has been quiet for a long time. However, since yesterday and today, the thermos bottle factories in this city have been purchasing en masse for raw materials because they see that the season is approaching. In addition, can factories and others also occasionally purchase, so the market appears to be bustling, and the asking price is rising step by step. Yesterday, 200-pound Association cargo was sold for 135 yuan per box, and double-linked plates of 20 inches and 28 inches with patterns were sold for 145 yuan per box. It is estimated that about 100 to 200 boxes were traded yesterday. Besides the two groups mentioned above, foreign merchants such as the Yantai group also loaded goods to other places.</p>
<p>North-South Goods, Qingdao Raw Peanuts, New Products Seen in Production Area</p>
<p>Qingdao News: 5,000 bags of existing stock of old raw peanuts were recently traded at 24 yuan, and later rose to 28 yuan to 29 yuan, with 500 bags traded. New products have also been launched, with only 20 bags arriving, purchased by the Shanghai gang, with a price of 38 yuan, exceeding the old goods by 10 yuan.</p>

<h3>Rice Industry Received Telegraph Yesterday: Hong Kong Permits Export of Rice, Ban on Transshipment Lifted Yesterday, Market Sentiment Relaxes, Rice Prices Fall</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong authorities, in order to prepare for emergencies, had previously issued an order to store large quantities of rice for emergency use, and at the same time prohibited the transshipment of all stored rice to other ports. After this news spread to the Shanghai market, market sentiment immediately turned upward, and rice prices rose frequently. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the rice industry yesterday that rice firms in this city received a telegraph from Hong Kong yesterday, stating that the Hong Kong government had lifted the ban on rice exports the day before yesterday, and that all stored rice could be transshipped to other ports. After the news spread to the market yesterday morning, market conditions became more relaxed, and market prices continued to fall by about three to four yuan.</p>
<p>Increase Inventory</p>
<p>The soaring rice prices in Shanghai were indeed caused by speculative rice merchants hoarding and manipulating the market. However, on the other hand, the source was often hindered by rumors of transportation restrictions, and people were inevitably panicked, making it difficult for market prices to fall. Therefore, smoothing the source and increasing rice reserves cannot be delayed. Moreover, during this extraordinary period, when the National Government's reach is limited, some speculative rice pests regard the law as a mere formality and engage in private transactions as a regular occurrence. Although the National Government and the authorities of the two concessions in this city have repeatedly ordered that the manipulation of large quantities of rice and the banning of illegal transactions be prohibited, the results have been limited due to the special environment. Large merchants rely on their power to control the market, and the relevant rice industry groups also use "insufficient strength" and "inability to cope" as excuses to ignore the situation, leading the entire rice market to its current state.</p>
<p>Ensure Public Security</p>
<p>Since the prices of domestic and foreign rice have risen frequently, the livelihoods of ordinary people have become precarious. If this continues, the entire public security of society will be greatly affected. Although the authorities of the two concessions are mindful of this and have repeatedly planned to take effective steps to implement them, while consulting back and forth on concrete measures to stabilize the rice market and repeatedly resolving to arrest illegal rice pests and punish them according to law, due to the special environment, it is difficult to eliminate illegal transactions in the market in one fell swoop, and rice prices continue to rise sharply. Ordinary people, unable to make a living, are driven to desperate measures. In the recent case of rice robbery near the intersection of Xinjibang Road East and Bili Road in Hongkou, it was found that a certain rice shop was transporting three bags of white rice worth about 230 yuan by truck from the warehouse of Chen Shaoqing. Just as the truck was loaded and moved out not far from the shop, it was surrounded and seized by several ordinary people, who then fled in different directions. As a result, one person, named Fang Asan, was arrested and sent to court for trial.</p>
<p>Group Purchase of Rice</p>
<p>The Shanghai People's Food Adjustment Association has repeatedly resolved to act as an agent for the collective purchase of a considerable amount of foreign rice. Now, the association has decided to take advantage of this decline to purchase in large quantities as a group. According to a member of the association yesterday, it is hoped that various factories, businesses, and organizations in this city will understand the livelihoods of their employees, advance large sums of money, and actively participate in the group purchase of foreign rice. If they continue to wait and see, and the employees still have to rely on purchasing rice from various rice shops in this city every day, then the burden on the livelihoods of the people in this city will increase sharply. The member continued, "Our association's handling of various procedures is honest and reliable, and is purely voluntary." Therefore, it is hoped that major factories will go through the rice purchase procedures as soon as possible, so that they can start purchasing in large quantities and allocate it regularly in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Refuse to Accept Collateral</p>
<p>It is rumored that the rice giants in this city have recently contacted the money industry, requesting that the various banks and shops restore rice collateral loans. It was found that this matter had been proposed and implemented before, but it was shelved because it was extremely difficult to prevent the use of collateral loans to hoard and manipulate rice. Now that rice prices are high, the old matter is being brought up again. It is not difficult to discern the intention. It is heard that the money industry has decided to comply with the instructions of the National Government and the two financial departments, and refuse the strict order to accept collateral loans for rice and daily necessities. The request from the rice industry will not be considered, in order to prevent fueling speculation.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Substitute Prosecutors, Superior Promotion, Higher Court Review and Reporting, Tao Dejun and Others All Substantively Appointed</h3>
<p>Tao Dejun and 19 other substitute prosecutors in the courts of the two concessions in this city are proficient in law and loyal in their work, and have served in the courts for a long time. According to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency who inquired with the courts yesterday, the Ministry of Judicial Administration is very concerned about the courts in Shanghai, and has ordered the higher courts of the two concessions to review and report on their attendance, performance, and merits. After successively complying with the order to report, it is heard that the Ministry of Judicial Administration has decided to distribute the substitute prosecutors, and will uniformly change Tao Dejun and the other 19 people to permanent vacancies, in order to comply with the law and encourage them to work hard.</p>
<h3>American Troops Taking Over Central District Urgently Awaits Early Decision, America Will Not Concede Due to Huge Assets, Chinese and Foreign Residents Eagerly Await the Takeover</h3>
<p>After the British garrison in Shanghai withdrew from Shanghai, the British military defense of the central district of the Public Concession that they left behind should be taken over by the American military, according to the decision of the garrison conference on August 25. However, due to strong opposition from the Japanese side, the Shanghai Municipal Council Volunteers temporarily took over the defense. Chinese and foreign residents within the concession all hope that this matter will be resolved as soon as possible, in order to stabilize the status of the Public Concession. A reporter from the Pingming News Agency inquired about this issue from various parties concerned. It is now learned that negotiations between the US and Japan on the issue of the US taking over the defense of the central district have not yet yielded a concrete solution. However, it is known that the US authorities will definitely adhere to their original intention and will not concede, because they actually own huge properties and rights and interests in the central district.</p>
<p>Close Contact with Washington</p>
<p>Since Herrick and seven others arrived in Shanghai on the 25th of last month, they have repeatedly held consultations with the US Minister to China in Shanghai on the issue of the Far East at the US consulate and on the flagship USS Augusta. According to knowledgeable foreigners, Herrick's consultations with the US military commander in Shanghai are often held at the US consulate on Jiangxi Road, but now they have been changed to the USS Augusta, and they are in close contact with the Washington authorities at any time.</p>
<p>US Warship Leaves Shanghai, Departure Was Scheduled</p>
<p>In addition, five destroyers belonging to the US Asiatic Fleet, No. 218, No. 219, No. 222, No. 224, and No. 230, which came to Shanghai with Herrick from North China on the 25th of last month, suddenly set sail from Shanghai one after another on the morning of the day before yesterday and sailed to the Philippines for the winter. The departure of the five US warships has aroused social speculation. However, according to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency who inquired with the parties concerned yesterday, the departure of these five destroyers from Shanghai to the Philippines was a pre-arranged plan and should not be surprised at.</p>

<h3>Stopping Black Market Speculation: Suspension of Forward Exchange Sales; Exchange Stabilization Fund to Stabilize the Exchange Market; Authorization for Foreign Banks to Handle Matters</h3>
<p>Since the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee used its full power to stabilize the legal exchange rate and maintain the Shanghai black market exchange rate, the exchange rate has remained consistently stable. After the establishment of the Sino-US $25 million loan, the foreign exchange fund has become increasingly substantial. The Shanghai black market exchange rate has been extended, and the value of legal tender has been invisibly increased. Now, in view of the increasingly tense and unpredictable international situation, British and American banks have decided to reject forward exchange transactions and foreign exchange swaps in order to prevent and eliminate speculation. After implementation, speculators will be unable to use their tricks, and the black market exchange rate will be able to maintain long-term stability, without affecting legitimate industrial and commercial sectors. - New Sound Society</p>
<p>Speculation Runs Rampant, Causing Profound Harm</p>
<p>A reporter learned from banks dealing in foreign exchange that forward exchange bills are one of the businesses of Shanghai exchange banks. For example, current forward exchange bills have terms of November and December, which means payment is due in November and December. It has been found that the exchange bills purchased by banks include those for non-export trade, such as demand drafts issued based on travel letters of credit, and non-trade reverse drafts, as well as those for export trade, such as documentary bills for collection and letters of credit. These exchange bills are mostly forward. Therefore, each exchange bank has its own forward exchange bill market. The Shanghai foreign exchange black market is beyond the reach of the Chinese government's authority, leading to rampant speculation and causing damage to legitimate merchants. Methods should be devised to strictly suppress it.</p>
<p>Forward and Swap Transactions are Suspended</p>
<p>The foreign exchange black market is rampant due to speculators, and unfounded rumors continue unabated. These speculators lack strength and mostly buy and sell forward exchange bills. After maturity, they often roll them over. This rollover is a swap. Such speculation is sufficient to affect exchange rates and the legitimate trade of a country. The harm it causes is not merely a matter of individual ethics for speculators. Therefore, all countries try to prevent foreign exchange speculation. However, under this special environment, the Shanghai foreign exchange black market has created unprecedented rampant speculation. The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee's painstaking efforts to maintain the black market have won the admiration of friendly nations. Now, HSBC, Mercantile Bank, Citibank, Chase Bank, and other British and American banks have agreed to suspend forward exchange bill transactions.</p>
<p>Stabilization Committee Authorized to Handle Matters</p>
<p>Regarding British and American banks working together with the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee to stabilize the Shanghai black market exchange rate, they will do their utmost to maintain it. If the market's foreign exchange shrinks sharply, the Foreign Exchange Committee will supply as much as possible. When the foreign exchange extends, the Foreign Exchange Committee will buy in. This exchange buying and selling policy strongly resists the attacks of speculators. Later, various foreign banks stopped foreign exchange swaps, aiming to reduce foreign exchange speculation. After all, under today's circumstances, the complete elimination of foreign exchange speculation is indeed difficult to achieve in reality. This rejection of forward exchange transactions is truly the only good way to eliminate speculation and stabilize the exchange market. It seems to be the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee that has authorized British and American banks to handle the matter.</p>
<p>Refusal to Sell Foreign Exchange Not the Case</p>
<p>The Datong News Agency says, quoting a report from the Japanese Domei News Agency, that American banks in this port will refuse to sell at the counter in order to secretly resist Japanese merchants, etc. According to an interpretation by a foreign economic authority in this port, foreign banks have recently restricted futures transactions, but all types of merchants are treated equally, with absolutely no discrimination against the Japanese. As for the Japanese rumors, there may be other intentions. However, the exchange market in this port has not been affected by these rumors, and the exchange rate has not shown a tendency to ease. There are many who are inclined to believe it.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Explains the Reasons for Water Accumulation in Shanghai; Illegal Construction Outside the Shanghai International Settlement Destroys Drainage Equipment; But the Whangpoo Conservancy Bureau Believes it is Related to the Neglect of the Whangpoo River</h3>
<p>According to the explanation of the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council regarding the reasons for water accumulation, in recent years, Shanghai has often suffered from water accumulation. The main reason is that there are many illegal buildings in the area of roads outside the Shanghai International Settlement (up to the railway), which has led to the destruction of most of the drainage equipment in that area. The ditch water overflows onto the road surface, up to the western end of the drainage equipment of the Shanghai International Settlement. The area of ​​this district is equal to the area south of the Suzhou Creek in the Shanghai International Settlement, so the wide range of overflow can be imagined. Since the beginning of last year, the Public Works Department has begun to set up machinery to clear ditches,</p>
<h3>Goods Stranded in Vietnam: Efforts to Transport Them Back to Shanghai; Chinese Business Groups Send Personnel to Handle the Matter; It is Reported that Shipping Between Hong Kong and Haiphong will Resume in the Coming Days</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Chinese business groups in this port held a meeting. Afterwards, it was announced that the goods stranded in Vietnam due to the blockade of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway are worth tens of millions of dollars. They will try to transport them back to Shanghai. At that time, it was decided that each merchant firm will send representatives to Haiphong and Saigon to request assistance from the Chinese consulates to find ways to transport the goods originally intended for transportation to the Chinese mainland back to Shanghai. According to what was known yesterday, shipping between Hong Kong and Haiphong will return to normal on the 8th of this month.</p>
<p>Clearing Ditches</p>
<p>By the end of last year, the main drainage hub had been cleared and has remained clean ever since. In North China, it is not uncommon to see hurricanes bringing heavy rain. In Shanghai, however, hurricanes often come without much rain. However, this time the situation was special. The arrival of the hurricane coincided with the high tide season. At that time, the wind and rain were mixed and came fiercely, lasting for 24 hours. At the same time, it stirred up the river tide, resulting in this major flood, which was only seen since 1865 (the depth of the water accumulation was 10% lower than that of 1865). Since Monday of this week, the tide has risen above some roads twice a day. Until today (Saturday), there is hope that the river tide will subside. Under this high tide situation, it is not only difficult to expect the road water to drain away, but also</p>
<p>Ditch Water Backflow</p>
<p>The only comprehensive solution is to block the outlet of the ditch on one side and pump out the accumulated water on the other. This method was designed by the chief engineer of the French Municipal Council many years ago. If it is only applied to the two Shanghai International Settlement areas south of the Suzhou Creek, it will cost about 100 million yuan and take ten years to complete. However, according to the Water Conservancy Section of the Whangpoo Conservancy Bureau, the accumulation of water on the roads this time is related to the tide, but not entirely due to the high tide. It has been found that the highest record of the Whangpoo River's high tide over the years is</p>
<p>Fourteen Feet</p>
<p>And more. The floods at that time were not as serious as they are now, and they did not last as long. The annual neglect of dredging of the Whangpoo River is an undeniable fact. Before the war, the dredging of the Whangpoo River over the years had improved the riverbed and water flow significantly. The neglect of dredging in the past three years has affected the rise and fall of the tide, and the high tide level has not risen much in recent days. Although the hurricane has stirred up the water level and made it higher, its impact is only a temporary overflow of the ditch, and it cannot subside all day long.</p>
<h3>Spokesman of the Japanese Embassy is About to Leave for Shanghai; Transferred to Consul in Singapore</h3>
<p>According to a report in the Continental News, Tsurumi Ken, spokesman of the Japanese Embassy, ​​stated at a regular meeting with foreign reporters the night before that he had been officially ordered to be transferred to the Japanese Consul in Singapore and was scheduled to leave Shanghai for his post in the near future. It is reported that Mr. Tsurumi has only been working at the embassy for more than a year. According to him, he had two missions in Shanghai: one was to convey news as quickly as possible, and the other was to improve the relations between Japan and third countries, or at least not to allow them to deteriorate. However, he believes that the regret is that he was unable to complete the latter mission due to his own lack of ability. Mr. Tsurumi had frequent contact with the foreign press in Shanghai. This transfer and departure from Shanghai is not without a sense of regret.</p>
<h3>The Tripartite Pact of Germany, Italy and Japan is Not Valued by Speculators; They Know that Germany and Italy Cannot Assist Japan; Disputes in the Far East Still Need to be Borne Independently</h3>
<p>The English-language Financial and Commercial News states that since the establishment of the Tripartite Pact of Germany, Italy and Japan, the exchange market in this port has not been shaken in the slightest, which is quite intriguing. Speculators in this port have always created something out of nothing and taken advantage of the situation. This time, however, they have failed to act. It is well known that Germany and Italy cannot provide military assistance to Japan. Some have said that the Tripartite Pact can allow Japan to act freely in East Asia without any worries. This is truly ignorant. Japan must bear the disputes in the Far East independently. For the past three years, if Japan had considered it to be in its own interests, it could have completely occupied Shanghai. The establishment of the Tripartite Pact has not changed this or other issues. Therefore, the victory that the signatory countries should convey is actually meaningless. Speculators in this port do not attach importance to this agreement, which is probably due to this.</p>

<h3>Negotiations on the Labor Dispute of a French Company Enter a Stagnant State Again; Labor and Management Did Not Meet Yesterday; The Issue of Workers' Reinstatement is Deadlocked</h3>
<p>The labor dispute of the French Water and Electricity Company, after mediation by the Political Department of the French Police, labor and management once negotiated on the 2nd, but no satisfactory result was obtained. Labor and management originally scheduled to continue negotiations yesterday morning, but the meeting could not be held due to the absence of the management representative, causing the labor dispute that gradually showed signs of resolution to fall into a stalemate again. According to the reporter's investigation, the Political Department of the French Police is very concerned about this labor dispute. At 4 p.m. yesterday, it summoned the labor representatives to the Political Department again to inquire about everything in order to find the most appropriate steps for resolution. It is heard that the labor's attitude, in addition to requesting the Political Department of the French Police to uphold justice and appealing to all sectors for sympathy and assistance, also requested the Chinese directors of the Public Works Department of the Shanghai International Settlement, Yu Zhiqing, Yuan Lvdeng, and Wei Tingrong, to consider the current plight of the workers' lives and the importance of social security, and urge the management to reopen negotiations as soon as possible in order to resolve the labor dispute as soon as possible and avoid the expansion of the situation.</p>
<p>Deadlock Between the Two Sides: The Key Issue</p>
<p>The labor dispute of the French Tram Company has been going on for ten days since it occurred, and there is still no hope of a complete resolution. According to the investigation of the Shewen News Agency reporter, the key issue is that among the various conditions put forward by the labor, there is one regarding the more than 40 workers dismissed by the company, who must be reinstated. However, the company authorities believe that the dismissal of more than 40 workers occurred some time before the strike and should not be included as a condition, causing dissatisfaction among the labor. The resolution of the labor dispute has fallen into a stalemate again. Therefore, the settlement of the French Tram Company's labor dispute must wait for the resolution of the dismissal of these workers.</p>
<p>Management Indicates Resolution Next Week</p>
<p>According to the English-language American Evening Post, the strike of the French Concession tram and bus has lasted for ten days and is still difficult to resolve. According to Favreau, the manager of the French Tram Company, yesterday, the resolution of the labor dispute may not be possible this week and will have to wait until next week to see progress. In addition, it has not yet been determined whether the company authorities and the striking workers will negotiate again. At the same time, three more employees of the French Tram Company were kidnapped last night, bringing the total to five. Two of them were ticket inspectors, and the other was a driver. Each kidnapping case was carried out by five people holding pistols. It is also said that the French Police denied this morning that a tram was bombed yesterday. According to the</p>
<p>Police Station, there was an old hand grenade, which was lost by the Chinese army that retreated into the French Concession in 1937 at the tram factory on Xujiahui Road,</p>
<p>The bomber detonated in a Chinese residence.</p>
<h3>Bank Employee Attempts to Embezzle Large Sums of Money; Falsely Reports Robbery; Case Adjourned for Judgment</h3>
<p>Chen Zemin, a native of Zhenjiang who worked at the Nanjing Tongcheng Bank, was ordered by the manager on the morning of the 29th of last month to carry 45,000 yuan in cash by train to Shanghai and hand it over to Jin Zhongheng, the owner of the Longchang Bank on Sichuan Road. After Chen arrived in Shanghai, he was instigated by his lover, Lu Zhenquan, and his cousin, Gao Yuhong, to embezzle the entire amount and hide it in the Zhaoshang Hostel at No. 13, Lane 566, Zhejiang Road. Then Chen bought a pair of sunglasses and pasted two plasters on the lenses. He then rushed to the Longchang Bank and falsely reported to his owner, Yu Zhongheng, that the money had been robbed at the Laobazi Road intersection. Jin believed it to be true and led Chen to report the case to the Huishi Police Station. After questioning Chen, Chinese Detective Shang Wu found Chen's statements evasive. After repeated questioning, Chen could not tell the truth. Detective Shang then ordered his staff to bring in the two suspects, Lu and Gao, and the stolen money. They were escorted to the First Special Court for interrogation and the case was adjourned. Yesterday morning, the police station prosecuted Chen Zemin for embezzlement in office, and the two defendants, Lu and Gao, for instigation. Judge Jiang opened the court for interrogation. The defendants all pleaded guilty and confessed that 100 yuan of the stolen money had been spent. After the court debate, the defendants were taken back into custody to await judgment.</p>

On the 22nd of last month, Jin colluded with architect Fei Shuqi (35 years old, local). Currently working in the real estate department of the Xingye Bank), leading more than a hundred workers, demolished all the houses in the lane and forced the tenants to move out. All the tenants, Zhang Qingfu, Pan Weisheng, Lin Ruisheng, and others, a total of 18 households, reported the matter to the police station. The detectives arrested Jin Wenzhi and Fei Shuqi the day before yesterday. Yesterday, they were escorted to the Criminal Court No. 8 of the Second Special Court, and a public prosecution was filed against them for obstructing freedom and destroying property.

After Judge Yuan interrogated them, he ordered each of the two defendants to provide a bail of 500 yuan and adjourned the hearing to the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3>Social Miscellany</h3>
<p>Yang Zhufeng, a woman from Shaoxing, and Zhou Yushi, a middle-aged woman, colluded with three fugitives on the morning of the 16th of last month with the intention of profiting by enticing Yang Acui, the 12-year-old daughter of Yang Wu, to leave her family at No. 41, Lane 520, North Suzhou Road. They were arrested by the Huishi Police Station and sent to the First Special Court for interrogation.

<h3>Discovery of Improper Conduct; Detective Shoots Paramour; Bullet Enters Left Brain and Dies on the Spot; Culprit Abandons Weapon and Flees After the Incident</h3>
<p>Song Huimin, a native of Tianjin, Hebei, is 34 years old this year. He is currently a probationary detective No. 149 in the preparatory class of the French Police. He has been promoted from constable to the present for more than two years. His wife returned to her native Hebei province half a year ago. Song and his concubine, a woman surnamed So-and-so (20 years old this year, from Anhui Province), rented the upper back room on the third floor of No. 5, Wuxing Lane, at the intersection of Belle Road and Poplar Road, for almost six months. Song has recently discovered that his concubine has been acting improperly outside, which is why</p>
<p>Frequent Conflicts Occurred</p>
<p>At 4 a.m. yesterday, another conflict broke out. Unexpectedly, Song, in his anger, decided to kill her to vent his hatred. He took his official pistol and fired a shot at her head. The bullet entered below the left cheek and ear, penetrated the brain, and did not exit. The woman died instantly. After the incident, Song abandoned the pistol next to the deceased, turned around, went downstairs, opened the back door, and fled. Neighbors who lived in the front room heard a gunshot in their sleep, as well as the sound of going downstairs and opening the back door. They got up and went to the back room,</p>
<p>Calling for Her Without Response</p>
<p>They stepped into the back room to check and saw that the woman was already dead in a pool of blood on the bed. They then called Wang Jiesan, the second landlord (40 years old, from Shandong Province. He used to be a policeman in the Nanshi area and now runs a stove business), to report to the French Police. Detectives rushed to investigate the incident and transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch for an autopsy.

For the sake of security, the authorities of the two Japanese settlements have implemented special precautions. On the one hand, they have carried out major searches and have cracked down on many bandit dens disguised as hospitals or hostels. According to reliable sources, a large number of bandits were holding a meeting in a secluded room at the Far East Hotel in the middle of last month when they were suddenly captured by the Japanese authorities and the police. It is heard that they usually hide in the occupied area west of the two concessions and take the opportunity to kidnap wealthy merchants in the two concessions for huge sums of money to squander. Unexpectedly, one of the kidnapped people had a good relationship with the Japanese, so the Japanese authorities learned the whereabouts of these people, and together with the police, arrested them.

Chinese Detectives Peng So-and-so and others arrested everyone involved and escorted them to the First Special Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiefei of Criminal Court No. 1 continued to hear the case. The defendants were defended by lawyers Ting Fanggang, Yu Enliang, Zhang Shewo, and Gan Lin.

<h3>Charity Table Tennis Women's Mixed Doubles Lineup Determined</h3>
<p>Peicheng Held Final Practice Yesterday. The Peicheng Girls' Middle School table tennis team, with team members Feng Mingyin, Guo Huichao, Zhang Lizhi, and Gui Rongzheng, has been selected as the mixed doubles representatives to participate in the charity table tennis competition against the Women's Youth Team. In order to fully prepare, Zhu Zhiying, the school's physical education director, held a final practice in the school's auditorium at 4:00 PM yesterday. Chen Linsheng, the first mountain instructor, described various important techniques for communication and hitting in doubles matches. It was decided to start practicing immediately. Guo Huichao was temporarily absent due to illness, and Zhang Xia was selected to pair with Feng Mingyin, and formed a practice match with the Zhang Gui team. Zhang is a basketball and volleyball athlete in the school, and she is very flexible. Although she was making her debut, she cooperated well with Feng, and as a result of the three rounds, the Zhang Feng team actually defeated the Zhang Lizhi Gui Rongzheng team by a score of two to one. Finally, the opponents were rotated and exchanged, and the hits were very outstanding. Therefore, the school decided to abandon Guo Huichao, and combined Zhang Xia's draw with Zhang Lizhi's block, and paired the all-around Feng Mingyin with the defensive Gui Rongzheng. Therefore, the lineup of the mixed team is even more complete, and it will definitely pose a serious threat to the Women's Youth Team. The mixed team's doubles roster is listed below:</p>
<p>Lin Jinlan Cai Xiuyu (First Doubles)</p>
<p>Feng Mingyin Gui Rongzheng (Second Doubles)</p>
<p>Zhang Lizhi Zhang Xia (Third Doubles)</p>
<p>Gan Lanjun Tao Lanying (Reserve Team)</p>
<h3>Three Musketeers of Shanghai Football Join Hong Kong Eastern Club</h3>
<p>Cao Qiuting, Xu Wenkui, Yan Shixin (Hong Kong Correspondence) The Eastern Football Club, in view of the approaching start of the football league, is engaged in sharpening its weapons and reorganizing its lineup. As for the position of goalkeeper, Liu Xianhan has joined Guanghua, but it is not difficult for him to return to his mother's house. And the three musketeers Cao Qiuting, Xu Wenkui, and Yan Shixin, famous players from Lido in Shanghai, have safely arrived in Xiangdao and decided to serve Eastern. Together with the original team members Hou Chengtou, Zhang Jinhai, Xu Jingcheng, Liu Shizan, etc., their strength is exceptionally strong. Their ideal lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Liu Xianhan</p>
<p>Yan Shixin Jiang Shanjing</p>
<p>Luo Weiquan Xu Jingcheng Liu Shidu</p>
<p>Hou Chengtou Cao Qiuting Xu Wenkui Zhang Jinhai Zhong Yongshen</p>
<p>The above lineup has abundant strength in the front and rear, and is suitable for both offense and defense, and can compete with the Sing Tao team. However, according to another source, Nan Hua has been dragged away by Sing Tao to a large number of fierce generals, and has the intention of attracting Hou Chengtou, Zhang Jinhai, and Zhong Yongshen. The truth remains to be verified. Also, the Eastern Association recently crossed the river to fight against the police team on Boundary Street. The lineup was relatively weak. The three musketeers from Shanghai had not arrived, Jiang Shanjing stayed in Macau and had not returned, and Luo Weiquan was absent due to an incident. New recruits Fu Zhibin and Chen Runfa had to fight on the front line. Fortunately, the police were disorganized, and Eastern narrowly won by a score of three to two. After the start of the game, the two sides held on for ten minutes. Zhang Jinhai of Eastern broke through the barrier and went straight in, and got a wonderful pass from Hou Chengtou. With a little skill, the ball flew into the net, opening the record. The police launched a major counterattack, and in the 28th minute, they did manage to pull back one goal. However, Zhang Jinhai of Eastern scored a goal in the chaos before the end of the first half, so the result of the first half was that Eastern took the lead by two to one. After changing sides, Feng Kunsheng of Eastern scored with a header, making it three to one. Half a minute before the end, the police struggled to win another city, summarizing the score as three to two, and Eastern won by a narrow margin. The lineup of Eastern's appearance on that day is as follows:</p>
<p>Huang Xiang</p>
<p>Xu Buyun Chen Runfa</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing Xu Jingcheng Liu Shizan</p>
<p>Hou Chengtou Feng Kunsheng Zhang Jinhai Fu Zhibin Zhong Sen</p>
<h3>Shanghai East Commune Basketball Game</h3>

<p>Xiangtai B - Alumni 4:30 PM</p>
<p>Shizhao - Yongxing 5:30 PM</p>
<h3>Football Practice Match: Donghua vs. Lux Today at 2:30 PM at Lafayette Road Stadium</h3>
<p>The West Union Football Tournament will be unveiled in the near future. In order to enhance their strength, the teams are making friendly matches. Donghua, the only Chinese team in Group A this year, held a full practice last week and will have a friendly test match with the Lux team this afternoon at the association's stadium at the intersection of Lafayette Road and Bihu Road. There will be matches in both Group A and Group B, starting at 2:30 PM, first for Group A, followed by the reserve group match. Both sides will determine the official lineup after this battle. According to this year's West Union Football Tournament, since Lido announced its withdrawal, the British and Scottish armies have also been transferred and left Shanghai, and the strength of the teams has gradually reached the same level. Donghua's lineup this year is extremely complete. Dai Linjing is back in uniform, Li Ning is making a comeback, and Huang Kehou, formerly of Lido, has returned. The morale of the army is greatly boosted. According to Dong Xiaopei, a former Donghua athlete, Donghua's entire team members are on the field to practice every Monday, Wednesday, Friday afternoon, and Sunday morning, and they are working hard. They have great ambitions for the major championships this year, intending to restore Donghua's former glory. The lineups of the two teams today are as follows:</p>
<p>(Donghua) Bi Gao, Li Ning, Wang Kehou, Zhuang Youren, Liang Shutang, Jia Youliang, Hu Hanwen, Wan Jin, Wu Binghao, Dai Linjing, Gao Baozheng, Lin Dianhua, Shu Shigeng, Li Gentong, Zhang Zhaopeng, Liu Guodong, Chen Zhuoxian, Sun Lu Fang, Fei Chunhua, Hu Qijie, Liao Shiming, Cai Shengsen, Li Ziqiang, Gan Zhiyi, Zhang Banglun, He Jiatong, Han Longhai.</p>

<h3>Introducing an American School</h3>
<p>The scorching heat has just passed, and the golden wind is refreshing. 14 million students in the United States are about to return to school again. 127 miles northwest of Boston, there is a Groton School, which only accepts 285 students. It seems to be a small scope, but it is actually very famous. The solemn and dignified academic style is very similar to several famous public schools in England, such as Eton and Harrow. England has public schools with a long history, but only Eton is the most outstanding. The United States has 15,000 private schools, and Groton School is the best among them. The founder of Groton School was Dr. E. Peabody. The school was established 11 years later with the help of celebrities. At that time, there were only 17 students. For half a century, although the school has not had many students, its reputation has risen and it has become a famous school. Dr. Peabody is 83 years old this year and retired last month to spend his leisure life in a village house near the school. The succeeding principal is Kruger, who is only 41 years old. He graduated from his alma mater and studied at Harvard and Cambridge.</p>
<p>The admission age for Groton is 11 to 13 years old. It does not accept students who are older because the school authorities know that to cultivate an outstanding student, it must take five or six years of cultivation. If the student is too old, there is nothing they can do. The freshman's degree is the same as the first grade of elementary school. Students must pass character and academic tests when they enroll. The annual tuition fee is 1,400 US dollars.</p>
<p>When new students enroll, they are only allowed to bring pocket money and no other money is allowed to be brought into the school. Because students have an allowance of 25 cents a week while studying at the school, allowing them to stroll around the village on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons. Once they enter the school, they cannot go out until mid-June. In addition, there are 19 days of vacation for Christmas and 17 days for Easter. Students are not allowed to leave the school at the end of the week.</p>
<p>The entire school building consists of three brick houses, a stone chapel, a gym, a baseball field, a ball field, and 90 acres of grassland. The student dormitory is very simple. A 60-square-foot room has a bed, a wardrobe, a chair, and six coat hooks. In the washroom, a long stone sink has a space reserved for each person to put a tin washbasin and three coat hooks. Each person has a desk in the classroom, and only fourth-year students have a self-study room. During the break after the morning class, eat some milk or soda crackers, but you cannot have both. If a freshman wants to sit in an armchair, it depends on his performance in the past year. Otherwise, he can only find it in the library.</p>
<p>Students have to wear long pants all year round at school. Students who have worn long pants for a year are qualified to be freshman instructors and tell the new students about their experiences in the past year. Tell them what things cannot be done and what events violate school rules. However, these old students have no special rights other than fulfilling their guidance duties, and they cannot bully new students.</p>
<p>US President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Wells, Ambassador to Japan Grew, Bishop Maffett, former President Ziwadu. Roosevelt, and the sons and grandsons of the wealthy Morgan, all graduated from Groton School and were personally instructed by the old principal Dr. Peabody.</p>
<p>There are a total of 30 teachers in the school, and there is almost one tutor for every six students. Their powers are quite large. If a student has a minor fault, he must be punished as much as possible. Last spring, a student criticized the food at dinner. He was punished to eat the same dish at every dinner, and then he had to stand up and leave the table, walk to the principal and say a few words of apology: "I have eaten enough and I am very happy. Now I am very sorry that I have to leave my seat. I cannot disturb the delicious dessert."</p>
<p>Teachers who eat with the students, if they see that the students at their table have bad "eating manners," they will ask him to stand up until everyone has finished eating. Those who make trouble for no reason are punished with "silence." Before the lips are unbanned, the punished student cannot say a word. Those who commit more serious offenses are punished with labor. Students who commit this kind of offense are often punished to clean the teaching room, mow the grass, sweep the leaves, or wash cars and bathe dogs and cats for the teachers. One teacher has an old British wool dog, which is specially used to provide punishment for students.</p>
<p>Groton Principal Peabody</p>
<p>The most serious offense is punishable by confinement, locking the offending student in a small room on the top floor of the dormitory, and giving him only water, bread, and a Bible as company every day. The duration of the punishment is two days, but this kind of punishment has only been used twice since the school was founded.</p>
<p>In addition to the "Spartan" strict education, Groton students also lead a "monastery-style" boring life. In ordinary American schools, you can always see female students, but in this school, except for the principal's family or the teachers' wives, women cannot be found. The nearest women are at Kang High School, 15 miles away. There is only one dance party held during the weekend before Washington's birthday in the year. Only the top two grades of students can participate. Beforehand, one representative from each of the two grades will go to the station with the teacher to welcome the girls. The girls will arrive at the school on Friday afternoon and stay in the teachers' wives' residences. There will be a performance in the school on Friday night, and a dance party will be held on Saturday night. It will stop at 11:45. The time for boys and girls to talk is only during breakfast on Sunday morning and between attending church.</p>
<p>Groton pays great attention to religious cultivation. No sports meetings can be held on Sundays. In addition to doing two services on Sundays, there are ten minutes of service before class on weekdays. Collective prayer is also required in the evening. Although Groton does not prohibit students of other religions from enrolling, religious cultivation is a compulsory course.</p>
<p>All day long, the bells in Groton School are clanging and endless. From getting up at 6:50 in the morning, the bells are continuously ringing every few moments until the senior students go to bed at 10:00 at night. Before attending church on Sundays, eight students go to the bell tower of the church and pull the ropes to ring eight different bells for a quarter of an hour.</p>
<p>Dr. Peabody himself teaches the "Bible" class, and this class is not a joke. After this class is over, the school atmosphere becomes slightly relaxed and lively. There are also a lot of exchanges between teachers and students, which can increase the feelings of both parties and achieve twice the result with half the effort in teaching. Therefore, a relaxed atmosphere is often maintained between the two. Groton students' weekly allowance</p>
<p>is 25 cents, as mentioned earlier. This makes all students equal. There are 30 scholarships in the school, and the children of ordinary people and the sons of millionaires are treated equally. The two grandsons of the wealthy Morgan also entered the school this year. They also eat their own food and try to earn some pocket money on their own. One started a shoe-shining business and could earn more than one yuan a week. One scraped the old paint on the boats by the river. This also took a lot of time. A teacher asked him kindly if he felt too tired. Morgan replied: "It is, but old paint is worth 50 cents a gallon."</p>
<p>Although Groton vigorously implements this spirit of grassroots economic construction, it is, after all, a school with aristocratic colors. Almost all graduates enter the officialdom or become nobles. As far as presidents are concerned, in addition to Roosevelt, there is also Coolidge. And there are still many special colors; like students have to wear hard collars when eating dinner. Black patent leather shoes must be worn for evening self-study.</p>
<p>Groton maintains a good academic style, which is simple, pure, and impeccable. Once, the authorities of another school wrote to Groton and asked why there were no students smoking or drinking in your school. The reply was "We don't have this problem here at all." Someone also asked what would happen if two students talked loudly in the lecture hall. The answer was: "They won't do that."</p>
<p>Former US Ambassador to France Bullitt said when he was young: "I don't know any Groton students who don't have a snobbish attitude of a gentleman." This is an exaggeration, but in terms of their appearance, it is inevitable to be criticized as such. However, in terms of its content, in Groton School, graduates, teachers, and students are a trinity, like a big family. This spirit is long-lasting and strong, which can be described as "accumulating thick and flowing light."</p>
<h3>The Situation in Dakar</h3>
<p>The U.S. State Department last month inquired about establishing a new consulate in Dakar, French Africa, in order to constantly monitor whether Germany would use French West Africa as a starting point for coveting South America and British African colonies.</p>
<p>Dakar Port is Germany's best strategic location to extend its influence southward and westward from Africa. It is also an important base for the French fleet in West Africa. French ships sailing from South America and South Africa replenish fuel in this port. The port's naval facilities are also complete, with strong fortresses, anti-aircraft gun positions, and a large arsenal. The port can repair destroyers and submarines and store a large amount of coal and oil. There is also a large airfield with hangars and repair shops. The South American air route operated by the French Aviation Company starts here. German planes can now take off from Germany, pass through the Netherlands and Spanish territory, and arrive in Dakar, carrying small teams of German troops. From Dakar, it is only 1,600 miles across the South Atlantic to Brazil.</p>
<p>Dakar Port is not only strategically important and well-equipped, but also can serve as a submarine base to attack key British shipping lanes. Ships sailing from South America or the West African coast and those rounding the Cape of Good Hope all stop at the free town of Freetown in British Sierra Leone in West Africa (located 550 miles south of Dakar), and then are escorted by British warships along the route near Dakar to Britain. If Germany were to seize Dakar by force and use it as a base for submarines and light surface raiders, Britain would have to send more warships for escort, and ships could suffer significant losses. Dakar's air base is also an excellent starting point for attacking British colonies in the south.</p>
<p>Britain has never trained indigenous troops in its African colonies, which is its weakness. France, however, has trained a large number of indigenous troops in its African territories, which, if used by Germany, would cause great trouble in the future.</p>
<h3>The Opium Poppies of North China</h3>
<p>The opium poppies are in full bloom again on the North China Plain. The area covered is much larger than last year. Taking a train from Beiping (Beijing), one can see white poppies everywhere, growing luxuriantly. The opium poppies planted this year are at least four times more than last year, and some say they have increased tenfold.</p>
<p>The area between Beiping and the Great Wall, the eastern part of Shandong Province, and the plains of central Shanxi Province are now covered with opium poppies. According to reliable investigations, one or two tenths of the arable land in the Shanxi plains is planted with opium poppies, and each acre can yield 180 taels of opium paste, the harm of which can be imagined. All areas in North China where opium poppies are planted are within Japanese-controlled areas. The opposite is true in guerrilla-controlled areas. Guerrillas in Shanxi Province have ordered the people to eradicate the planted opium poppies, with severe penalties for violators. A very large amount of opium paste is produced annually in Inner Mongolia. Farmers have recently been alarmed and are destroying opium poppies. The organizations under Japanese protection, however, fine villagers 50 yuan per acre if they eradicate opium poppies.</p>
<p>The land tax per acre for planting opium is 10 yuan in Inner Mongolia, 12 yuan in Hebei Province, and 15 yuan in Shanxi Province. The land tax is low, and the purpose is to encourage the planting of opium poppies. (Translated from a Christian Science Monitor dispatch from Beiping)</p>
<h3>Several Famous Public Schools in England</h3>
<p>— L</p>
<p>Eton, Harrow, Winchester, and Rugby are the four most famous schools in England. They are all public schools, different from private schools, but somewhat similar to public schools in America. Among these schools, Eton is the most outstanding. Founded in 1440, it has the longest history and has produced the most famous figures in politics. In general, however, these four schools are all birthplaces for important figures on the British political stage, and they represent many different factions. It is not easy to get into these schools. Parents have to pay 250 pounds in tuition each year. There are so many applicants that they often have to wait a long time for an opportunity. Ancient Latin and Greek are among the required courses.</p>
<p>British public schools retain many special characteristics. Each school has its own representative school emblem, and graduates wear ties of different colors with pride. There are also some peculiar habits: Harrow students always wear hard-brimmed straw hats and vests, and when they salute, they raise their right hand and extend their index finger; Eton students usually wear tall hats and tailcoats, showing a noble and dignified attitude. They also play a game called "wall game," and in the past 100 years, only three goals have been scored! They wear black clothes to mourn George III, the patron of the school (who died in 1820). On June 4th, his birthday, all the students wear a bright flower on their lapels to commemorate him. Eton even has its own language, which outsiders often do not understand.</p>
<p>Eton admits 1,100 students each year, Harrow 650. Since 1850, Eton has produced a total of ten British Prime Ministers. Harrow has produced four fewer, a total of six. Every Harrow graduate carves his name on the wooden boards of the school building. When Eton students score 50 runs in cricket matches, they plant a tree on campus. The Duke of Wellington, who defeated Napoleon at Waterloo, was an Eton alumnus. He planted a tree on campus, and many people say that Wellington's victory at Waterloo was due to his training on the Eton playing fields.</p>
<p>In addition to the ten Prime Ministers, current political figures who attended Eton include Eden and Lord Halifax. It is estimated that one-sixth of the 615 members of the British House of Commons attended Eton. King Leopold III of Belgium also studied at this school.</p>
<p>Harrow was founded in 1571. Notable students include modern politicians such as Prime Minister Churchill, Lord Gort, Director of Military Education, and Sir Hoare, Ambassador to Spain. Famous literary figures who attended the school include the great poet Byron and the novelist Galsworthy. Rugby was founded four years earlier than Harrow, in 1567. Former Prime Minister Chamberlain was a graduate of this school. When he formed his cabinet, seven of the eight cabinet members were graduates of this school. The famous educational novel and film "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" is based on this.</p>
<p>Eton students wear dark green ties with light lake-colored stripes, while Harrow's ties are black with double thin stripes; Rugby's ties are dark green with wide black and thin white stripes, which are darker than Eton and Harrow. Winchester's ties are vermilion, crimson, and dark blue, which are very eye-catching. This school is the oldest of the British public schools, founded in 1394. It now has seventy students, who live in 17th-century school buildings and study in Victorian classrooms, truly ancient.</p>
<p>Other well-known British public schools include Charterhouse, founded in 1611. Sir Baden-Powell, the founder of the Boy Scouts, was a graduate of this school. Westminster School was founded in 1561 by Queen Elizabeth, and the great literary figure Johnson was a top student at this school. Uppingham School, founded in 1584, is a birthplace for famous bishops and skilled cricket players. Radley College was founded in 1557 and was originally just a grammar school. It now has 380 students. The famous educational film "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" was filmed here.</p>

<h3>We Should Look Up to God</h3>
<p>In our current life, everything we hear and see is unsatisfactory, eight or nine times out of ten. One family does not know another's affairs. There are great difficulties for some, and small difficulties for others. No one is without difficulties. Many people shed tears in secret, thinking that God does not care for us. They are depressed all day long. This pessimistic mood really should be remedied. What method can be used to remedy it? There is no other way except to raise our heads, look upwards, and look up to God in heaven. If we do not look upwards to God, then whether we look outwards or inwards, we cannot invigorate our spirits. Because when we look outwards, we see bankrupt farmers and depressed businesses. It can be said that no one is not suffering, and there is no hope. If we look inwards, we only see ourselves with scars and many defects. We cannot lift our spirits either. Therefore, to invigorate our spirits, we must look upwards to our God. If we do not look up to God, then the result will be like what we are experiencing now. Nothing can please us. Everything that God makes us encounter has good intentions. If we do not look up to God, then there will only be discouragement and only disappointment.</p>
<p>God is the one who gives people strength. If we look up to God, we will surely receive strength from God to cope with all difficulties and hardships. The world is full of changes. Those who own millions of assets and live in luxury may soon be landless. Sometimes they are guests of honor, sometimes they are prisoners. Wealth and honor are like passing clouds, changing constantly. We rely on human power and human strength, hoping to have a support, but human power is sometimes as unreliable as an iceberg, and human strength sometimes comes to an end. What can we do? The poet of the Jewish nation said: "I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth. He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber… The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil… from this time forth, and even for evermore." (Psalm 121) We should also have the same faith as this poet, and look up to our God. (Reprinted from the 10th)</p>

<h3>Please Benefit Children Again</h3>
<p>— Xinfang</p>
<p>After reading Wang Cangping's article, "Please Benefit Children," in addition to sharing Wang Cangping's hope that Shanghai's enthusiastic people can rise up to advocate various children's welfare undertakings, I have one more supplement: the issue of extracurricular reading for children. Before the August 13th Incident, we could say that this type of reading material was still abundant. The Commercial Press published "Children's World," "Children's Pictorial," etc., and the China Publishing Company published "Little Friends," "Youth Weekly," etc. Other enlightened publishers had "New Youth," but after the war broke out, these publications were suspended one after another. Until the war shifted westward, they flourished again for a period of time. At that time, the publications were probably founded by several elementary school teachers, such as "Shanghai Children," "New Children," "Good Friends," etc. Major newspapers such as Shen Bao, Sino-American Daily, Da Wan Bao, Xinwen Bao, and Wenhui Bao also published children's supplements every week. At present, there is an unprecedented silence. The supplements in the newspapers have been suspended due to soaring paper prices, and some have reduced their space. As for the periodical publications, there is not even one. Not long ago, we also saw a "Children's Monthly" edited by Wang Renlu, but it was discontinued after two issues. The consequences of this phenomenon are very regrettable. Some children do not know how to use their spare time, and the street stalls in the isolated island are full of children reading absurd and useless little books, which is due to the lack of proper extracurricular reading materials for children!</p>
<p>From this, the importance of children's reading materials is self-evident. Therefore, I hope that the writers, cultural circles, and publishing circles who are still in Shanghai can use part of your energy to benefit our children in this area. The sales of children's reading materials may not be comparable to other books, but for the sake of the country's future, this does not need to be considered again. Finally, let me propose four principles that must be based on when editing children's reading materials, for everyone's reference: instill knowledge of children's era, cultivate children's lively emotions, cultivate children's good virtues, and increase children's knowledge of life.</p>
<h3>Autumn Diseases</h3>
<p>— Su Ming</p>
<p>The weather has changed from hot to cool, which is undoubtedly a sign of the arrival of autumn. When autumn comes, diseases are most likely to occur. Look, the newspaper reported that more than 1,000 people died in the two concessions last week, and most of them were Chinese. This news will certainly not escape the eyes of an average child. That's right, autumn is indeed the season when diseases are most rampant. "So why is it easiest to get sick in autumn?" "How do you get sick?" These two questions are reacting in the child's mind. In the eyes of ordinary children, the child is like an idiot, and can ask such naive questions. However, children, if you are asked, can you answer it? I think, although the question is very ordinary, its answer is not ordinary. So it is not easy for a child to think of meaningful questions, and your brothers and teachers are very happy to answer you. Therefore, when the child asked his brother these two questions, his brother was very willing to tell him:</p>
<p>How do diseases happen? This question is not easy to answer, because the word disease covers a very wide range. What kind of disease is it? What cold, cholera, malaria, dysentery... There are thousands of kinds, so the characteristics of various diseases are of course different, and the occurrence of various diseases is of course different. But in short, no matter what disease occurs, there must be a kind of disease bacteria that is making trouble in the patient's body. To know that people get sick, it is not a matter of one day and one night of not paying attention to their own bodies that will happen, but unknowingly, they send the bacteria into the body continuously. So over time, the bacteria will slowly attack. Even in a healthy human body, there are often bacteria that cause diseases. However, at that time, our body's resistance is strong, so that these bacteria are suppressed silently. Once the body's resistance is weakened, the bacteria will run rampant in the body, and the resistance cannot beat them, so the person gets sick. Then where do the bacteria enter the body from? In any part of the body, the bacteria have the opportunity to invade, and the most common is through the nose and mouth into the body. That is, the bacteria are mixed into the air we breathe, or mixed in food, and also invade from skin wounds. Therefore, in our daily life, we must always be careful and guard against the transmission of bacteria into the body, that is, to keep the body clean, wash hands often, choose some clean and cooked food to eat, and there are other various preventive methods. As for why it is easiest to get sick in autumn? Because in summer, there are more sunny days, and the sun is terrible, even those bacteria have fear of the sun, and we are often exposed to the sun, so we disinfect the body, so the chance of bacteria invading the human body is less, and they are mixed into our body from food. At this time, the body's resistance is still strong, so it does not attack in summer. When autumn comes, the autumn wind and autumn rain reduce the power of the sun; the air is also more humid, which is a good opportunity for bacterial activity. If the human body's resistance is weakened, the bacteria inside and outside the body will attack the human body, and the human body will of course feel unsupported and should surrender, so I have to ask the doctors to inject the medicine into the human body, which is also adding a new force to fight the bacteria. But in the current era of soaring prices, I can't even afford to get sick. One</p>
<h3>Song of Tomorrow</h3>
<p>— Qiulang</p>
<p>Dear children; your summer vacation is over. Some of you who are eager to learn may have joined this newspaper's summer homework competition, and have done well and submitted your papers for the three items of composition, calligraphy, and painting. What are your results? Wait quietly for the announcement in the future. If you do well, you will of course receive rewards and honors. What an interesting thing! But I am afraid that some lazy children, who do not join the competition, spend all day playing games, and even if their fathers and brothers urge them to review their lessons or practice writing, they often postpone them. They put it off from today to tomorrow, and pass the days in a muddle-headed way. This is really detrimental to your future and wastes your precious time. Isn't it a pity! I happened to recall that the ancients had a "Song of Tomorrow," so I have specially recorded it for lazy children to take as their motto and deeply reflect on themselves! The song goes: Tomorrow and tomorrow, how many tomorrows there are, I wait for tomorrow, everything goes wrong, People are misled by tomorrow! Look at the water flowing east in the morning, and watch the sun set in the west in the evening, how many tomorrows are there in a lifetime? Please take the Song of Tomorrow to heart.</p>
<h3>The Story of the Flyer</h3>
<p>— Tang Yaming</p>
<p>In the past, when airplanes had not yet been invented, people imagined that if they had wings, they could fly in the sky. Indeed, the invention of the airplane almost came from this idea.</p>
<p>It is said that in ancient Greece, a man and his son did indeed fly in the sky with wings.</p>
<p>The man's name was Daedalus, and he was skilled in handicrafts. He made many beautiful and practical things, so he became famous far and wide.</p>
<p>Once, he lived on the island of Crete, and at that time, he suffered a great hardship, because he met the enemy of the island's king, so he and his son were imprisoned on a desert island.</p>
<p>Later, Daedalus thought that there was no other way to escape except to make wings out of feathers and attach them to himself and his son. So he attached them to his father and son, and told his son not to fly too close to the sun, so they flew away.</p>
<p>At first, the flight was very smooth, but the child was so happy that he forgot his father's instructions and flew higher and higher. So the wax and feather wings were melted and separated by the heat of the sun, and as a result, the child fell into the sea.</p>
<p>Finally, Daedalus flew to a certain city and was treated kindly by the king of that place. This story may not be true, but it is very interesting.</p>
<h3>Shirley Temple's Autobiography</h3>
<p>— Min</p>
<p>Mr. Sheehan immediately wanted us to go to his office to talk, so Mom hurriedly took me there. Mr. Sheehan shook hands with me and sat me down on his desk. He called me Shirley, and he was so affectionate. His hair was already gray, but his cheeks were red and he didn't look old at all. He said to me, "Dear, I think it won't be long before you make millions of people happy—whether they are sick, depressed, or poor—even old people and young people will be happy. In short, no matter who, everyone who sees you will be happy." They will all have to love you, making you the most lovable little girl in the world!"</p>
<p>That night we hired a car to go home, which had never happened before, because the fare was very expensive and we usually couldn't bear to do it. Mom was very happy and said that we hired a car tonight to celebrate. Guess what, I'll tell you something important; I heard Mom and Dad say that we signed a contract later. At that time, because I didn't know how to write my name, I signed an X on the contract. Do you think it's fun? When I first signed the contract, no one thought that I would be so warmly welcomed today.</p>
<p>Not long after the completion of my second film at Fox, one day, a child in the studio came to Mom and said that several letters had just been delivered to the mailroom, which were sent to me. We hurried to the mailroom, and they handed us a small package. Mom and I sat down and opened it together. We didn't know those who wrote the letters, but they had all seen my films. They said many sweet things in their letters, saying how happy they were with me; some even wanted my photo and wanted me to sign it personally.</p>
<p>Mom was happy and very proud to receive these letters, because this was enough to prove that people had begun to pay attention to me. Those famous big stars such as Chaplin, Mary Pickford, and Janet Gaynor can receive hundreds of letters every week, and so does Mickey Mouse. Guess how many letters I receive now? A thousand a day!</p>
<p>At first, there were not many letters. Mom and Dad thought that they would have time to open and answer them after dinner every day; but before long, they couldn't handle it. Now, this matter is handled by my secretary, Miss Delue. Mom and Dad still open many letters when they have nothing to do—especially those from far away places such as China, Japan, and India. Every Christmas, Easter, and my birthday, April 23rd, I receive more letters than usual, and some even come with packages of gifts. I like to open these packages the most, full of surprise and joy. Most of the packages contain all kinds of dolls, or small clothes for dolls. In addition, I also receive many books and books about various games.</p>

<p>Entertainment Circle</p>
<h3>After Entering the Cinema</h3>
<p>We watch movies, of course, to seek physical and mental comfort and happiness. Here are a few points for readers to refer to; however, these are completely my own opinions.</p>
<p>(1) If you understand the dialogues (referring to Western films), it is best not to read the instructions, as this will increase your interest.</p>
<p>(2) Be careful not to sit next to people with bad habits! (Such as coughing, spitting, talking loudly, etc.)</p>
<p>(3) Don't sit too straight. Because the light reflected directly from the silver screen can easily hurt your eyes.</p>
<p>(4) If it is crowded, if you go later, don't think that the middle must be full; sometimes it will unexpectedly give you a very good seat.</p>
<p>(5) An old lady sitting with a young man: "Is this a good person or a bad person?" She will always be wary of you and always try to avoid you.</p>
<p>(6) Don't sit next to many people of the opposite sex who are about your age, sometimes it will make you embarrassed!</p>
<p>(7) For horror films and gag films, it is best to sit in the middle; for war films and beast films, it is best to sit a little farther away; for romance films and tragedies, you can sit in the back.</p>
<p>(8) If you have not had a snack or dinner, do not eat cold food in the theater!</p>
<p>(9) When you are excited, don't gesticulate wildly, lest people hate you.</p>
<p>(10) A man's hat must be taken off, otherwise it will obstruct the view of the back seat; it is best not to talk too much with your companions, otherwise you must also speak very quietly.</p>
<h3>Chi Shih-kung's Clear and Melodious Reputation</h3>
<p>— New Voice</p>
<p>The performer of old male roles (xusheng) should have a refined appearance, a dignified manner, pure acting style, a clear voice, accurate pronunciation, and an elegant demeanor. The recently debuting young old male role performer, Chi Shih-kung, fulfills all the above conditions.</p>
<p>Shih-kung is a new talent who recently graduated from the Fu Lian Cheng opera school. Even when he was in school, many people said that his style was very proper and that he had great promise. After graduating, his reputation indeed became clear and melodious, astonishing everyone. Last year when I was in Peking, Shih-kung was performing at the Guang De Lou theater alongside Ye Sheng-zhang and others. After hearing him perform in "Catching and Releasing Cao Cao" and "Empty City Stratagem," I was convinced that this performer was the most promising among the rising old male role actors.</p>
<p>Now that Shih-kung has come south with Wu Su-qiu, he is like a newly forged blade, radiating brilliance and being aggressive. Although his voice is not yet fully sonorous, he is very good at using it. In singing, recitation, acting, and martial arts, he can uphold the standards of famous artists in every aspect. He has not been tainted in the slightest by the frivolous styles that are popular nowadays. His appearance is slightly similar to Yang Bao-sen, but much more refined. The intonation of his recitations resembles that of Fu Ying in some places and Shu Yan in others, with Shu Yan's influence being the most prominent. A few days ago, in the "Fa Men Temple" drama, the scattered phrases he sang, "Little Chuan Peng, he is originally a murderous criminal..." and "Scolding Sheng Gongdao is a beast..." were extremely subtle in their rise and fall. We closed our eyes and listened quietly from the audience, and felt that they were truly somewhat like the taste of Yu Da-xian.</p>
<h3>Having Seen "Xiao Xiang Autumn Rain"</h3>
<p>— Lan Li</p>
<p>Recently, I saw a performance of "Xiao Xiang Autumn Rain" at the Hu Guang Theater. This film is also adapted from folk tales. The actors and director are very competent. The scenery and costumes are a bit too crude, but generally speaking, it is satisfactory.</p>
<p>The gist of the story is as follows: A wealthy family's daughter falls on hard times and becomes the adopted daughter of a poor fisherman. She marries a scholar. The scholar goes to the capital to take the imperial examination, passes first, and becomes blinded by fame and fortune. He abandons his former wife like dirt and marries the daughter of the examiner, with his father-in-law's help, becoming a county magistrate. The former wife goes to find him (a journey of a thousand miles to find her husband!). Instead, she is falsely accused of theft and exiled to a desolate island. However, heaven has eyes, and she encounters her long-lost father on the way. Moreover, her father has already become a high-ranking official. After executing the punishment first and reporting it later, he naturally takes revenge and snatches her husband back from others. Father and daughter are reunited, and the couple renew their old affection.</p>
<p>Putting aside the happy ending, we see in this film: the tyranny of the wealthy and the corruption of officials. The realism, under the director's skillful touch, reaches our eyes, and we are deeply moved.</p>
<p>As for the several interludes in the film, they are very moving. The one sung by Chen Yun-shang at the gate of Linjiang Post Station is even more full of sorrow, anger, and resentment. Many in the audience were moved to tears because of it! In addition, the one sung by Bai Hong is also a mixture of cold irony and heated scolding, with endless flavor!</p>
<h3>"Destruction" Premieres Today, Starring Shangguan Yunzhu</h3>
<p>The long-awaited three-act tragic play "Destruction," a new creation by young writer Hou Yuanqing, will premiere today at 10:00 AM at the Carlton Theater. Famous artists from the film and drama industries will collaborate in the performance, directed by Chuan William and stage managed by Mei Xi, starring Shangguan Yunzhu, Hong Wei, Cheng Ying, and others. All the actors in the play are women, with not a single male role, truly a unique drama.</p>
<p>Hawthorne's Investigation</p>
<h3>The Ballerina's Destination</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Two People Arrested</p>
<p>The arrival of these two people was somewhat abrupt, but Hawthorne showed no surprise, and politely invited them to sit down.</p>
<p>Xu said, "Mr. Hawthorne, this guy has been clamoring to see you—for over an hour already. He says he's willing to confess himself, but he wants to talk to you, so he insists on seeing you. Of course, we didn't agree to him. Knowing that Detective Ni returned to the police station, he asked me to accompany him here."</p>
<p>Hawthorne nodded and asked, "How is Zhao Boxiong doing?" The detective shook his head and said, "Not yet. After Detective Ni arrived at the station, he kept the guy in custody. He went home for dinner himself and hasn't questioned him yet."</p>
<p>Hawthorne turned his gaze to Yu Gantang. Although Yu Gantang was sitting, he was actually only perched on the edge of the chair. His upper body was completely straight, and his eyes also revealed a kind of expectation and eagerness.</p>
<p>Hawthorne asked, "Mr. Yu, what do you want to see me about?"</p>
<p>The young man hurriedly replied, "Mr. Hawthorne, you can just call me Gantang, I don't deserve the honor. I—I have something to tell you."</p>
<p>Hawthorne responded with a smile, "Does it concern this murder case? Why didn't you want to say it in the police station?"</p>
<p>Yu Gantang glanced at Xu before saying, "I don't want to tell them. They keep saying that I killed Lilan, it's simply framing me! They are all—are all—"</p>
<p>Hawthorne anticipated that the young man's following words might embarrass the detective next to him, so he hurriedly interjected, "What do you want to tell me? Tell me quickly, don't be roundabout."</p>
<p>Yu Gantang answered directly, "I want to tell you that I am not the murderer, I did not kill Wang Lilan. It was Zhao Boxiong who killed her!" When he said these words, his voice was very firm, and his face also showed a corresponding expression.</p>
<p>Hawthorne had no surprised expression and still said calmly, "What you say must be true, but you have to explain it separately: First, explain why you yourself are not the murderer."</p>
