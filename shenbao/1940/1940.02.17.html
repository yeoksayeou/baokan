<p>社評</p>
<h3>投機造成今日之物價</h3>
<p>今春紅盤物價暴漲銳利無匹，頗引起一般人之驚訝，而不知為投機商在總結賬期以前之計畫，有疑此說為不類，何主投機商組織如是其靈活，力量如是其偉大，能一呼百應，漲至如此高度。獨不念今日之投機商，皆所謂「贏錢撲賭，」故常不惜孤注一擲，去冬多存貨過年，即是預備紅盤大漲之地步。先之以造作種種傳說，搖惑人心，使人人心理，皆以為物價必高漲無疑，旣而只要金價一高，便可雲龍風虎，隨之而升。果然，紅盤開市，外滙尚鬆，而金價猛漲矣，顧外堅內弛之金市，尚不足以鼓動投機市塲之興趣，故近數日乃從外滙金市雙管齊下，於是百業市塲，悉為投機商所制，而失其自主之力。春節開市無多日，不論何貨，二分鈿三分鈿之賺頭，安然獲得；加以去年各業所盈多者千餘萬，少亦數百萬數十萬不等，如此暴利，安得不造成投機商之勢力，使投機者更興高采烈，不投機者亦思染指，致有今日整個市塲成投機瘋在之局面，然亦惡劣之環境與阢隍之時局有以使然也。</p>
<p>此次物價之暴漲，既不可以常理論，投機商之心理，又不可以利害動；市塲之調整，物價之平準，徒作呼籲何益，復不可望於目前，是則物價將任其一如脫線之紙鳶上升不已乎？此在今日之局面，或不幸而竟成事實。是則一般安分守己，不操縱，不投機，從勞力以獲報酬，恃薪工以資度日者，不將為投機商所犧牲乎？此就事實而論，固已如此矣。顧惟人能適應環境，亦惟入能改善環境。以全上海言，投機商此次操縱，非憑藉惡勢力，即利用阢隍之時局，施展其多財善賈，長袖善舞之手段，以向大多數人謀剝削，此其一；而此次物價之上漲，旣非全由於消費量之增加，而囤積居奇，實為其主因，囤積之貨物同依然存在也，將來仍必流通於市塲，供消費者以消費，此其二。故大多數生活被壓迫者，明於投機者之心理，利於暫存不利於久蓄，久則市塲之變化不可測，拆息棧租損耗之不可免，故往往利用一時人心之惶惑，掀風作浪；恃其周轉靈敏之資力，賤進貴出；而為害於人羣。然果一旦失所憑藉，亡所挾持，則昂首而來，曳尾而去，固意中事也。如去冬油市，聞大連油有來滬之說，立貶十餘元，尚乏買戶，今春一漲十六元，猶爭相購進，非無油也，人心之所向小同耳。然則今日投機商所囤積以居奇者，焉知不有一朝貨運復通求售無主歟，更以物價暴騰之自然結果，將令一般消費者為之驟减，如工廠及熟水業因迫於煤貴而停業者踵相接是也。由此觀之，予投機者以打擊，亦視消費者之靭力如何耳！</p>
<p>夫平凖物價，積極方面，自在供求之調整，產銷之相應，此可語於常時，而不能求之亂世。消極方面，則為因物慣昂貴而自然節約。節約本為美德，但處上海環境中，或以為窮酸，或以為迂腐，然在今日即中等之家，恐亦非節的不能自存矣。節約云云，即限制消費，節縮購買力，在生產者之立堪言，雖非好氣象，然為應付在漲之物價，猖獗之投機，不如此，適為其造機會耳！嘗聞談及日人之生活狀况，發電因水力暴竭，存煤缺乏，不得不减少電氣供給，於是戶戶以燭代電矣。自來水每日開放二小時，人人節其用水量矣，米糧歉收，乃迫令節省午膳，不得過飽，改以馬鈴薯等果腹矣。小至火柴之微，以其材料可製軍火，限制每人日用四根矣。凡此所云，有已見諸日議會質問，自非無因，彼因戰事影響，經濟竭蹶，竟不得不實行極端緊縮，他如戰爭中之英法等國，亦莫不提倡節約，俾以所有之物力財力用於戰爭，博取最後之勝利。乃返觀滬人士之生活，依然揮霍無度，浪費成性，一若今日之繁榮，紙面之富貴，為可長享久安者，而不念浪費之結果，終必有無以為繼之一日，故縱無物價之暴漲，亦應節的矣，何况今日因投機商之操縱，物價扶搖直上，已予一般生活以嚴重之威脅，此固無人能否認者。彼投機商人只知損人利己，罔顧同胞之死活，而當局對於遏止投機復一籌莫展，故一般普通人民若不早自為計，儘量减低其生活程度，仍復享用如常，則旣無以摧折投機者之氣燄，恐自身亦將墮入投機者之陷阱而成犧牲物。此應從各人自身做起，造成節的風氣，衣敝組袍而不恥，簞食瓢飲而不改其樂，若曰此迂闊之論也，然物價橫漲，長此不變，終必有不幸而言中之一日也。</p>
<h3>日盼解決美懸案　東京談判將再開　美禁運動根深蒂固　有田戒日人勿抱樂觀　赫爾稱未聞日擬抗議對華貸款說</h3>

<h3>戈林將軍演說　勗農民努力生產　適應戰時需要　德在軍事經濟方面　自信立於不敗地位　波蘭人百萬被迫襄助農作</h3>
<p>柏林　航空部長戈林上將、自去年九月開戰以來、昨日第一次向德國農民發表廣播演說、闡明「一九四○年生產戰爭」之基本原則、宜稱、「經濟方面」吾等不能被克服、軍事方面更難擊敗、士氣尤其不可克服、」戈氏申稱、德國已經屯儲穀物七百萬噸、同時政府採取措施、帶助德國農民盡量增加農業之生產、英法現又重施故技、欲以經濟封鎖摧毀德國民族、但德國經濟制度因平時已有組織、不能再蹈一九一八年之覆轍、德國今日東南北三面之交通均確保無恙、農工商之經濟基礎均已穩固、過去數年、吾等幸未虛擲一分光陰、雖原料缺乏、但因努力生產、以及德國發明家之發明、已經有大量之代替品、較之外國原料尤有過之、因此吾等在經濟方面不能被克服、軍事方面更難擊敗、士氣民心尤其不可克服、英國對此、想應認識、</p>
<p>戈氏繼稱英帝國立國有三大原則、（一）經濟開發、（二）橫施暴力、（三）多行不義、其所用一貫武器為「造謠宜傳」、此種原則及方法、今日對於德國均無所施其技矣、以富庶之英國對於糧食問題、今日　抄襲德國限制購買制度且限制購買之數額、較之德國尤小、豈非可笑之事、須知英國欲於短期內抄襲國社主義方法、決難奏效、因其一貫的財閥制度、非可急就推翻也、吾等相信英國必有儲備、但此項儲備遠在海外、因吾國潛水艇之活躍、使之沉於英國沿海岸之海底、但吾國對於穀物·馬鈴薯·糖·油果等之屯儲、均係在德國境內、絕不受外力之破壞、戈氏繼要求德國農婦、努力田間工作、因前綫農夫不能抽調回鄉、但政府將動員靑年及波蘭人暨俘處一百萬、協助今春之農事、同時軍中具有特別技能及專門農業經騐之農夫、亦將免除軍役、回至農村工作、至於外籍農夫農婦之參加工作、并非如巴黎倫敦所稱出自暴力威脅、而係彼等欣然自願、在德謀求有工資報酬之工作、戈氏繼稱、今春農事所需之一切馬匹·機械·農具·燃料·肥料等、均已完全預備、同時運輸問題亦已着手辦理、</p>
<p>戈氏繼提出「一九四〇年之生產戰爭」一語、為德國農人之口號、力言每一畝地均娘充分利用、英國對德之封鎖有稱之為「脂肪封鎖」者因其特別以隔斷德國脂肪給養為目的、因此德國必須努力脂肪生產、以粉碎英國之計劃、增加脂肪之生產、其具體措施有下列四種、</p>
<p>（一）增加五十萬畝地種植油果、有特別豐牧者予以特別獎金、（二）每一農塲至少增加百分之十至百分之十五之甜菜及馬鈴薯、（三）改草地收塲為農田、每二畝半、政府予以津貼二百四十馬克、（四）增加牛奶及牛油之產量、政府以獎金鼓勵之、同時勸農民少用牛奶、俾製牛油以代舶來品、</p>
<p>最後戈林要求德國農民保持信心、繼續奮鬥、并高呼「勝利屬於我等」及「希特勒萬歲」之口號後即散會（十六日海通電）</p>
<p>巴黎　德國四年經濟獨裁者戈林上將、向全國農民所發表之演說、頃由此間政界人士加以評論、咸謂戈林對於中歐各國、尤其是蘇聯所可接濟德國之農產品、并無隻字道及之、殊可注意、緣德蘇兩國經濟協定、於本月十二日在莫斯科簽字成立之後、德國各報莫不盛稱政府已為全國人民取獲無窮的原料接濟、詎意此次戈林演說、僅以經濟自給自足主義為標榜、并以埋頭苦幹、改良生產方法、俾得增加產量勗勉國人、則德國不信能在經濟上、長此依賴蘇聯及其他各國、殆可於此獲有明證矣云（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　德國四年經濟計劃獨裁者戈林上將、昨日向全國農民所發表之演說、此間各報均加以評論、咸謂演辭內容、除循例譏刺英國而外、尚有兩項要點、一即以極認眞的語氣、要求全國農民埋頭從事生產、二即證實德當局已將波蘭國人民一百萬人、移至德國從事耕植、工黨機關報每日民聲報」載稱、波蘭人民橫遭德國當局之虐待、此實現代最殘酷之壓迫手段、自由黨「新聞紀事報」載稱、波蘭平民之在德國淪為奴隸者、除俘虜而外、已有二十萬人之譜、此輩斷非甘願前往德國云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>滬西界外馬路　警備協定昨簽訂　在滬西區設置特別警察隊　一部份隊員由工部局提出　日領聲明願與局方簽訂北區協定</h3>
<p>滬西界外馬路之警務問題、歷經公共租界工部局總董樊克令總裁兼總辦費利溥與「市府」半年米之往返談商、已於昨（十六）日下午六時、雙方正式簽字、租界當局蓋鑒於界外為路過去之不良情况、事實上實有改善之必要、因此而促使共解決也、茲將各情分誌如次、</p>
<p>協定全文（一）上海「特別市政府」與上海工部局協議後、決在滬西越界築路區設置特別警察隊、並在此區域內、分設適當數之警察署及警察分所、警察隊全體人員、佩帶特殊顯明的肩章或徽章、在此臨時協定期內、為在該區內唯一有權之行使警權機關、</p>
<p>（二）特別警察隊之隊員人數及其機構、由上海「特別市政府警察局局長」與上海工部局警務處總巡協議決定之、</p>
<p>（三）特別警察隊之一部份隊員、包括若干高級職員在內、由上海「特别市政府」在工部局舉薦之候補人員中派充之、</p>
<p>（四）在外國人有龐大財產地區之警察署署長及經協議決定之若干署員、由上海「特別市政府」在上海工部局舉薦之候補人員中派充之、</p>
<p>（五）上海工部為得派連絡員與滬西區持別警察隊協力合作、</p>
<p>（六）凡關於外國人之案件、由上海工部局所舉薦而由上海「特別市政府」委任之外國籍警官處理之、</p>
<p>（七）上海工部局舉蔫而由上海「特別市政府」委任之警官與上海「特別市政府」委任之其他警官間、如有意見不同時、應分向「特別市警察局局長」及上海工部局警務處總巡請示解決辦法、如仍不能解決而認為必要時、則請示上海「特別市市長」與上海工部局總董、</p>
<p>「附註」本臨時協定、分作中英文二式、但各條條文之解釋及迻譯則以華文為依據、</p>
<p>日領聲明</p>
<p>同盟社十六日上海消息、上海「特別市政」府」公共租界工部局本日簽訂滬西越界築路暫行協定、駐滬日總領事館當局亦發表談話、對此表示欣幸之意、同時聲明日方既有準備解決工部局警察復歸蘇州河以北地區問題、殊堪注目、其談話內容如决、滬西越界築路地區警權問題、由「特別市政府」與公共租界工部局、自去年以來、進行交涉、而至今日關於根本原則成立協定、決定在該地區設置上海「市政府」之特別警察區、並於日內山兩當局繼續折衝、討論實施此項協定之細項條件、日方因特別關心該地區之治安情形今决成立此項協定、不勝欣幸、又日方自去年以來、與公共租界工部局進行交涉、商議工部局警察復歸蘇州河以北地區問題、以圖一九三七年以來陷於不正常狀態之上海早時恢復原狀、而會於去年八月與工部局商定大綱、然旋因滬西發生工部局警察官越軌行為、不得不暫停止其實施、而至今日、現今協定成立、滬西地區行將明朗化、因此、日方準備與工部局從速簽訂去年成立之協定、且開始協商其實施上必要之細項規定也、特此聲明、</p>
<p>細則待商</p>
<p>續據記者探悉、此項協定簽字後、即發生效力、至於該區域內警察隊數額、及其警察署之分設處所、署長及高級職員等問題、將於短期內由雙方協議、再行決定、關於外國人案件、則純由外國籍警官處理、大的越界築路設置警署之期、為時已漸近矣、</p>
<p>臨時錯誤</p>
<p>該項界外馬路警務臨時協定、原定昨日下午四時三刻、雙方舉行簽字、故工部局總董樊克令總裁兼總辦費利浦、早已準時到塲、日本總領事三浦、亦於三時五十分前往、該協定計分中英文兩式、不料正擬舉行簽字時、發覺協定之英文木打字、頗有錯誤、於是傳方工作人員、於慚恧狀態中、復將該英文本加以改正、直至五時餘、始獲竣事、於是協定上簽字之樊克令費利浦兩氏及傳筱庵、始於六時完畢其任務、並悉昨日偕同樊費兩氏前往者、尚有法律顧問博良氏、傳方則蘇錫文等亦會參加、</p>
<p>未涉捐稅</p>
<p>該項協定簽字後、關於界外馬路警務部份、雖已暫吿落、但關於外捐稅問題、則尚在毫無）眉目中、據昨夜外籍記者聆日方發言人在新聞報導席上之表示、亦謂界外捐稅問題、目前尚無任何決定</p>
<p>經費問題</p>
<p>當外籍記者詢日方發言人以日軍是否能容許特別警察於越界築路之外、行使職權時、發言人稱、除因此等區域中、迄今尚無爭執發生、日軍駐紮其地、似無問題」、此外實無所知、發言人又稱、警察之維持費、將由誰付、彼亦一無所知、會議席上、又會聲稱此協定業已分送滬上各領、以供披覽、</p>
<h3>基督敎奮進會　舉行佈道大會</h3>
<p>上海基督敎奮進會、定於十八日起至二十四日止、聯合上海各教堂、舉行佈道大會、特別編輯題材、（除斜橋安息會於每日下午三時舉行外）每晚七時半開堂講道、歡迎各界往聽、地點如下、慕爾堂（虞洽卿路三馬路口）·守真堂（貴州路牛荘　路口濟良所）·安息會（徐家匯路斜橋）·閘北堂（麥根路七頁五十八號）真道堂（麥特赫斯脫路新閘口）·鴻靈堂（巨潑來斯路麥祺路）·主恩堂（靜安寺路聯吉里）·中華基督敎堂（康腦脫路小沙渡路口）·純道堂（賈西義路三百二十六號）·伯特利敎會（八仙橋）·內地會（新閘路一五一七號）·聖保羅堂（山東路二馬路口）·聖彼得堂（愛文義路陳家浜）等、</p>
<h3>各區市民會促請　擴大平糶範圍　平糶決廿三日起續辦　每人一元改售五斤半</h3>
<p>上海市第一特區市民聯合會第十八，二十七·十五·三十六三十七·等各區市民分會、爲促請平糶會擴大平糶範圍、特敬吿各界、請慨助平糶捐款、以惠貧民、其吿各界書云、滬市物圓暴漲、給予中下階級市民嚴重威脅、允以食米爲甚、因為其他東西、尚可節省、或可不用、惟有米糧、就不可一天缺少、所以有句古語、叫做「民以食為磊」、這種情形、當然不能讓其延續下去、於是先有租界當局之會銜佈吿、嚴訂限價、查禁囤積操縱、繼之以各界領　組織上海民食調節協會、辦理訂購洋米及平糶事宜、春節開市後、米價叉突吿昂漲、嗟吾小民、將無瞧類、為應急計、惟有促請平糶委員會、擴大平糶範圍、暫為救濟、惟平糶虧耗、有待籌集的款、所戶有力者、一致慷慨輸將、俾平糶完成最大使命、這不僅加惠貧民社會安寗、均有裨益、</p>
<p>二期平糶廿三開始</p>
<p>上海平糶委員會於昨日下午三時、舉行第五次常務委員會議、主席虞洽卿、報吿事項、捐款揭至二月十五日止、已收到五十六萬七千四百五十九元四角三分、討論事項、議決定二月二十三日起、繼續委託米號業同業公會會員、辦埋牛糶、每人限買一元、每元改為五斤半、因現在米價遞漲、按每元五斤半計算、每石須虧耗七元以上云、按照此售價、每石僅售二十九元、而購進成本須三十六元餘、若照現在市售價格（四十元八角）、虧損達十元零，角、</p>
<p>慈善機關施賬不懈</p>
<p>本市佛敎同仁會給票施粥、辦理以來、頗得社會人士之贊許、茲該會於昨日舉行董事會議、決續印粥票－萬張、以惠貧民、</p>
<h3>煤商拒絕發售　操縱極爲明顯　但目前煤球存底極充實　富戶勿多購免剌激市價</h3>
<p>連日煤球激漲市民咸受深刻影響、實則滬市目前煤球存底、極為充實、足供市民需要、可母　驚怕有、無形中反被奸商利用、上海市商會。上海市第一特區市民聯合會。等各公　、暨各重要煤號、頃已磋商　節供應辦法、俾滬市煤球售價、得早日同平、各公團深信以目前煤球存底及產量觀之如能在供需方面獲得適常調節、煤球價格、不難即時下落、切望各界市民、沉着相處、勿多所購儲、刺激市價、各公團及各煤號日內將繼續集議、務將煤球價格於短期內抑平、</p>
<p>有行無市</p>
<p>本埠物價飛漲不已、市民生活所受威　、日益加重、尤以米煤兩項爲資生必需物品、其增漲之速、更足使人震驚、據大通社記者探悉、多數煤球商店並拒絕將煤球發售、形同有行無市、意在居奇、顯而易見、顧客購煤、咋須憑舊發票、方肯售給、新戶亦拒絕發售、查煤球價格、在戰前每擔僅九角左右、上月間價格亦袛三元餘、在最近數星期中、始突飛猛漲、其為人所操縱、甚為明顯、因其市價漲動之速、故各煤球商對售價頗不一致、蓋多數煤球廠商、隨少數操縱市價廠商為轉移、若當局不迅予抑制、上海居民生活所受之威脅、將漫無止境、日益加重、</p>
<p>當局調查</p>
<p>兩租界內五百餘家熟水店、因受煤價翔貴影響、遭受嚴重打撃、均已紛紛暫停營業、該業公會雖會數度集議妥善辦法、及呼籲援助、迄今兼旬、朱獲圓滿解決、顧熟水店停業關係於整個民生頗巨、並各機關團體學校住戶至感不便、茲租界當局對於熟水停業、深為注意、昨曾派員赴熟水業調查詢以熟水店停業原因、聞將設法仰低煤價、</p>
<h3>戰後橡膠業　一蹶不振</h3>
<p>日前偶晤橡膠業會中人、據云、本年橡膠業之衰落、逈非外界所易想像而得知者、緣本埠橡膠製品業在民國十五六年間為鼎盛時期、迨至民二十年以後、即遭一二八之亂、逐漸衰落、半由戰後金融緊縮半由民衆</p>
<p>購買力弱</p>
<p>直至八一三前一年方見轉機、不意又逢八一三之變、同業廠多數均被砲燬、頻年以來、能遷至安全區復業者、不及原有十分之三、目下併計未遭兵亂之廠、不過十餘家、值此時局、原料工價、百物暴漲、</p>
<p>來路阻塞</p>
<p>製衣成之後、交通不便、幾至無法銷售、各廠　能勉強工作、無非維持工友生計而已、不過亦有不能勉力繼續者、如物華橡膠廠已有數年歷史、比因無法維持、已易牌改主、叉如交通義生等廠、亦</p>
<p>時作時輟</p>
<p>殊少蓬勃氣象、永和實業公司之橡膠部、則自一二八戰役後、因少發展機會、迄未恢復、尚有正春廠因舊廠交通不便、已在武定路另覓新址、籌備有時、現正積極生產、實因各費激增、運銷不易、生產增多、不特不能贏餘、或將虧折、因為售價過高、將無人過問、减低叉不合成本、殊有進退為難之概、所以今年之橡膠業、可稱為末日、</p>
<h3>羅馬呢亞公使　自滬倦遊返日</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、羅馬尼亞駐日公偵巴拉契凡斯科、游滬已歷數週、今日（十六日）乘克利扶蘭總統號情離滬返東京、</p>
<h3>英領吉特遜　長期休假</h3>
<p>星期日離滬　會訪傳筱庵</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、駐滬英總領事喬治、昨（十五日）偕英領事吉特遜往市中心區非正式訪會「市長」傳筱庵、吉特遜係向傳氏告別、蓋吉氏將乘星期日午刻離滬之　間丸編作長期休假也、</p>
<h3>意輪過滬　鋼鐵運日</h3>
<p>日方在歐洲　會大量收買</p>
<p>日軍侵華以來、對於物質消耗損失甚鉅、故在各侵佔區城、儘量搜羅鋼·鐵·銅·錫·鉛·等五金之類儎回日本、趕造侵略利器、但所收刮者尚不够、故在歐洲各國大量收貿、過去鋼鐵直接運日、及經滬轉日者、爲數不可計、最近又由意輪裝　來舊鋼鐵一千零四十噸、新鋼鐵一百二十八噸、共計一千一百六十八噸、該輪滬貨咋已卸淸、定今日出口、將鋼鐵儎往日本交卸、</p>
<h3>青年會　組織聾啞社</h3>
<p>上海中華基督教靑年會所組織之聲啞社、定於今日（十七日）下午二時半、假八仙橋該會九樓東廳、舉行成立大會、節目有主席報吿·演講，選舉職員·聚餐·攝影·餘興等、聞前往登記者、已有一百餘人之多、</p>
<h3>日報宣傳　虹口設新警區　華人入開放區仍有被捕危險赴浦東登陸者須受嚴重檢查</h3>
<p>上海泰晤十報云、日文上海每日新聞昨（十五）晨載稱、觀於虹口通行證限制之寬弛與工部局警務處日籍人員之增多兩事、今料警務處不久將設立新「東區」而由日人任該區首腦、預料工部局總辦兼總裁費札浦返滬而工部局與「上海市府」簽訂西區越界築路協定後、設立新警務區之計劃、即將實現、</p>
<p>鵲巢鳩佔閘北虹口楊樹浦　自前天開放後、昨爲第二日、往閘北之烏鎭路橋、正在修理、不能通行、故咸往四川路橋繞行、過橋後、兩旁市住房、什　皆鵲巢鳩佔、非設軍事機關、即開設各種公司行棧店舖等、</p>
<p>南市情況據傳日方此次開放滬郊一部份區域、具有特別意義、除海軍警備區已於昨日實行外、南市方面警戒錢以北之熱鬧市區、雖屬防軍警備區、據稱下月一日起、亦將開放、市民無證均可通行、一方面將滬郊米糧為平民主要食物便利其運輸，抑低共價格、（目下滬郊米價、最高國米每石三十七八元、與租界相差十元以上、）使租界內平民受生活壓迫而遷居滬郊、</p>
<p>開放意義以遂其「繁榮市面一之企嗣、偽「市府」因一稅」收不多、經濟恐慌、誘使住於租界內之前住滬郊民衆歸去、以增加其苛「捐一雜「稅」之收入、惟因民衆感於走出孤島、身體上即無法律保障、隨時有被捕危險、故偽「府」迷夢、仍吿失望、至沛東方面所有日本海軍第四大隊駐紮之區域、於十五日（前日）起撤銷所謂「警局」之「市民證」平民行走已無限制其開放地段、</p>
<p>則浦東方面甚　狹窄、朝南至張家洪為止、朝東至洋涇港為止、西與北至浦灘止、面積南北直徑的六華里、東西直徑的九華里、的共五十四華方里、張家洪朝內洋涇港朝東、為日陸軍警備區、以河浜為大然界限、無「市民證」仍不准　河通行、又其名稱雖曰開放、但自租界棄渡船至浦東、當各渡口登陸時、仍在日海軍監視下、受「徒手警」嚴密搜查遇有被視為可疑者、仍須予以逮捕、與未開放時並無區別、由浦東楊家渡碼頭乘渡船赴南市、又須携帶「市民證」、吾則即有扣留危險、</p>
<p>日兵傲慢英文大美晚報云、昨日（十五日）午後八時、某外人乘電力公司小卡車後座、行抵匯山區附近、被日陸　隊哨兵一名所阻、日哨兵操英語向該外人聲稱「君乘之車、行駛稍過迅速、若在三個月前、吾人已將君投諸河中、但今為求友好起見、僅向君作溫和警吿」云、“哨兵復操華語向卡車駕駛人發同樣警吿、</p>

<h3>營養不均</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉音</p>
<p>人才的缺乏與失業人數的衆多，是現社會的一大漏洞。這種矛盾的現象不僅値得注意，而且是一種相當嚴重的社會病態。</p>
<p>美國的「美國人雜誌」，最近曾微求國內三百個最著名的工商業領袖的意見，問他們目下工商界是否需要人，而所需要的是那一種人才。結果所得的答案，幾乎是完全一致的。他們都以為目下工商各界需人甚急，而所需要的是那種能虛心學習，肯努力苦幹的專門技術人才。據統計，一九四〇年全美國所需要的人才約二百萬名。</p>
<p>可驚的事實是：美國的工商界雖然這樣需要人才，而國內同時却有一大批的人無工可做，賦閒在家，在受政府的救濟。這不但是國家社會的一大損失，而且也是現社會制度的一大悲劇。</p>
<p>據說，美國大學校裏的最優秀份子，都已經被羅致了；而普通辦公室的辦事員，二十五人中僅有一人合格，可見目下失業的人，有一部份是自己的能力不充實所致，這是應該以努力自修及學習去補救的。可是還有一部份人，心有餘而力不足，他們雖然一心向上，却因為經濟關係而不能受更高深的敎育與訓練，要他們成為專門技術人才，事實上是不可能的。在道裏，現代敎育的不切實際，恐怕也逃不了一部份的責任的。</p>
<p>現社會所患的是營養不均的毛病。</p>
<p>社會</p>
<h3>職業診療所</h3>
<p>— 卿</p>
<p>在失業不成問題的蘇聯，對於『怎樣彌補學校敎育與職業生活間的間隙』一問題已實施一種頗著成效的制度，這就是蘇聯的靑年『職業診療所』。</p>
<p>在蘇聯，關於靑年職業指導的一種新奇而精密的制度，已有相當的發展。靑年到了完畢學校課程而預備選擇一種願就的職業的時候，已獲得關於各部門工業的廣博知識。此項知識包括怎樣印書，怎樣訂書；怎樣紡織，怎樣製造織物；怎樣製備木材與保存木材；包括對於各式各樣的機器及其應用的了解。在農業方面，他們熟知蔬菜園的春季種植與秋季種植，熟知猪與兎的培養，熟知集體農塲與國營農塲的工作步驟。</p>
<p>每一學校都與鄰近的工廠，農塲，或機車站發生關係，使每個學生都得到實習的機會。經過七年的初步訓練，學生纔有資格進入工廠學校。工廠學校附設於各種特殊工廠中，為期二年，共目的在使學生同時獲得理論的學識與實際的經騐。在工廠學校中，學生們以一半時間從事實際工作，一半時間從事書本研究。</p>
<p>每一工廠學校有一個重要的運帶設備，就是『職業診療所』。換句話說，就是各種特殊工廠，除設置工廠學校外，又設置「職業診療所』。每學生四百五十人，有心理學家一人。這心理學家須兼備專門學院畢業與三年以上敎授經騐的資格。</p>
<p>職業診療所的目的，是研究在工廠學校中要求工作的兒童的全人格，即包括遺傳因素與環境因素的人格。對於每一兒童，無論男性或女性，都施行個別的接近。為施行不同的敎授的依據起見，敎師必須知道在他級中每個兒童的不同的個性。中央診察部所保存的每個學生的記錄，包括他的健康情形，他的各種測騐，心理學家第一次與他會見時所發見的關於外界環境的情形，家庭背景，與雙親及朋友的關係，讀何種書籍，參加何種俱樂部，對於各種職業的興味與知識。</p>
<p>職業診療所對於每」兒童施行各種職業測騐，藉以指示他在職業上的各種特性，如自立等等。對於從莫斯科以外的地方來的學生，特別重視他在以前學校中的工作情形及他的以前敎師們的意見。職業診療所的一個最大的功能，就是：調整兒童，家庭及學校的態度與實際。對於兒童的興味與能力，作很充分的研究。假如某一兒童在某一工廠學校中對於工作覺得不愉快或不適合，就由指導部把他調到另外一個工廠學校中去重受調整。</p>
<p>學生在工廠學校中住過了兩個月後，須寫一篇論文，敍述他對於道個工廠學校的印象。職業診療所設有顧問，專門分析這些論文，而且分析的結果常常引起敎授方法的改變，有時甚至引起工廠設備的改變。這些顧問，常和兒童的雙親會面，使他們對於他們子女的理想與興味，獲得更深刻的認識。</p>

<h3>賽珍珠女址論書</h3>
<p>— 華志</p>
<p>「因為旁人愛讀這書，你也跟着去讀，這是毫無意義的。我願意把世界上銷路最旺的書籍的統計表摧毀無餘。任何册子的銷路，即使在廣吿的宣傳上，也要嚴守秘密，聽憑讀者去試練他的眼光。」</p>
<p>以上是美國當代小說家賽珍珠女士最近的言論。因為根據紐約書界最新統計結果，她以中國為背景的許多小說和散文，在銷路上佔了第一位。便有一般人揄揚她作品的優秀，致得如許美滿的成績。但她不禁說出了相反的話。</p>
<p>賽珍珠對於作品的暢銷，並不認為一定是內容充實的徵象，很多是因為震於作者名字的心理，而形成一種流行的時髦心理。她自己承認過，沒有一個作家的出品是全部可觀的，以她個人論，初期作品是「大地」等，的確是為興味所驅使；但後來受了畫　的催迫，漸漸地作為商品看待，這在商業主義的美國社會，任何作家原是不能或免。</p>
<p>去年賽珍珠得到諾貝爾文學獎金頒給她的消息，為之愕然，不信有道回事。她所顧慮的正是作品的日就潦草，會引起輿論界可能的譴責，料不到反增加一種意外榮寵。</p>
<p>然而賽珍珠與一般唯利是圖的書商畢竟有別。她不願讀者盲目地去買任何銷路最好的書。她願讀者放出選擇的眼光，决定他心目中最有價値的讀物。在擁有廣博的讀者的中國社會裏，賽珍珠的見解，確是相當適用的。</p>

<h3>無聊</h3>
<p>— 雷星</p>
<p>碰見朋友第一句話總免不了問一問近况：「近來幹些什麽？」答案竟也都差不多的乾脆：「無聊得很。」嘴有還刻着一絲笑痕。</p>
<p>人實在是一種古怪的動物，自己欺騙自己却還是滿足得意得很。上面那幾位朋友全希望自己能多活幾年。但，我替他們想想眞覺得悲哀。我要大聲的呼喊：「這是生的浪費，可恥的浪費。」</p>
<p>我不懂：一個人為什麼要讓無聊來纏住自己呢？世界如此的遼闊，可為該做的事不是很多嗎？殘酷的時光會把人埋葬，我們能不珍惜自己的年華嗎？</p>
<p>世界上有許多偉大的人物，他們已呈獻出寳貴的物事給人類。然而，當他們臨終的時候還說：我要活。這生的執着使我們激動。</p>
<p>生活並不是「混日脚」。它應該有一份意義。擺在你我眼前最大的問題是「怎樣活？」</p>
<p>隨着時光的河流倒溯上去，拿出你自己的「紀錄」瞧一瞧，塗寫了些什麼？還是依然一張白紙呢？</p>
<p>人生的愉快是從生活的豐富與充實中得來的。工作完成後淡淡一笑，多輕鬆！那是金錢所買不到的。首先我們就該扔掉無聊；我們得「有聊」。</p>
<p>年輕的朋友們，記着：生活應該有一份意義，別冉說無聊了。</p>

<h3>無形玻璃</h3>
<p>— 浪花</p>
<p>美國紐約的白露琪脫女博士，最近發明了一種藥品，塗在玻璃上面，可以使其完全看不見。</p>
<p>光錢在經過普通的玻璃之時，只有百分之九十二能够通過，但是用白女士發明的藥品，塗在玻璃上之後，通過的光錢，便達百分之九十九了。</p>
<p>這種塗過藥品的玻璃，不再反映光錢，無論光綫如何强烈。鐘表，商店，住宅等，裝配了此種玻璃，看上去便好似沒有玻璃一樣。如果把它製成眼鏡，那末便不再使人慼受光綫反射的不便了。</p>
<p>照相術也將因此而大為進步。以前即使用最精良的鏡片攝影，也有百分之八的光綫漏去，至於較决的鏡片，只有百分之二十五到三十五光綫，能够到達底片；但是自從將該藥品，塗在鏡片兩面之後，上述的一切缺點，就完全沒有了。</p>
<p>該項藥品的製法，頗為秘密，吾人只知道製造該藥之時，需要原料六七種之多。該藥製成以後，可以保存極久。</p>
<p>不過，用該藥塗染玻片之後，必須把玻片浸入酸性溶液之中，方可有滿意的成績。</p>

<h3>經濟奇窘　仿製乏術　日本杜絕五彩片</h3>
<p>— 華志</p>
<p>對華侵略以來，日本國內的電影事業日就銷沉，政府為節省外匯支出起見，加緊西片的入口禁律。各電影院所映都是二三流的片子，沒有一片偉大的，影迷們感到極大的失望。日本往年開映美國的片子，每年不下數白片，開戰以來，就實行限制，去年只准輸入一百五十部，今年已縮為八十部，由好萊塢駐日的八家影片公司平均分配，每家僅攤派者十部。而且　部影片只許進口一份拷貝，如在日本影院不够分配時，其他的拷貝需在日本添印，藉此為國家挽回一些利權，正是一種無可奈何的事。</p>
<p>然而普通的黑白片，日本人果然優於仿製，而五彩巨片，他們就沒有辦法。因為五彩片在美國有發行的專權，它比較普通片子，多了八種製片的手續，日本根本沒有這種設備。最重要的還是入口問題，因為九彩片的傳影發音，五部片子成為一組，缺一不可，故輸入一部五彩部變成五部，十部就變成五十部了。</p>
<p>好萊塢的影片商，會和日本當局商議五彩片入口的變通辦法。據說每部五彩片要照五部片子的價値收納關稅，並收五部片子的檢查費，同時受五部片子的剪接手續。如此一來五彩片即使幸而公映了，座價須增四倍而且也不能保證射影滿意。無怪美國影片商都抱頭嘆息，稱這種辦法為「世所罕聞」。</p>
<p>日本旣杜絕了五彩片，現在流行於全世界的五彩巨片的五十部，再沒有和日本影迷見面的機會。他們所最渴望的五彩巨片如白雪公主「羅賓漢」「小公主」「乘長風去」和「木偶奇遇記」等，然而祗能望洋興嘆了。</p>
<h3>胡蝶重返銀幕</h3>
<p>「絕代佳人」公映有期</p>
<p>中國第一大明星胡蝶，與影迷暌違已久，現在又重返銀幕了，這不僅是中國電影的光榮，更是電影觀衆的一個喜訊！</p>
<p>胡女士這决重返銀幕的作品，名叫一絕代佳人，」是寫明末時代一個校書美人陳圓圓的一生可歌可泣的事蹟，胡蝶演古裝片，此為第一次，她就飾演了道不肯靦顏事仇的女兒，她那一舉一動一顰一笑，一定會使每個觀衆隨着她的表演而轉移。</p>
<p>「絕代佳人」實在是中國電影史上劃時代的一部偉大傑作，在這片子裏面，所包羅的人才，如導演的王决龍，主演的王引，王乃東，蔣君超，白璐等，都是無可適宜的上選，而攝影與收音，都足以與舶來片一較高下，佈景的富麗矞皇，古色古香，極盡其美，實為過去一切古裝片所僅見，單單耗於這方面的資本，就達十萬元</p>
<p>「絕代佳人」是華新出品，定於二十一晚上起在新光大戲院獻映，我們願竭誠推薦與觀衆，相信這部片子一定能給觀衆一新耳目。</p>

<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>坤伶打炮不宜唱玉堂春</p>
<p>內行人有句話叫「凍不死的靑衫子，熱不死的花臉，」這個意思就是說凡唱靑衣的越到數九寒天，冰雪在地的時候，依舊須穿着綢衫單褲上臺，內裏想襯一件棉襖褲，那是絕對不可能的。反之，像唱大花臉　花臉的，也不能在最熱的天氣，揮汗如雨的當兒，把蟒袍箭衣內的胖襖除掉；有時候胖襖之上加箭衣，箭衣面襯褶子，褶子上面再加蟒袍玉帶，頭上或戴着帥盔夫子盔、金踏鐙、銀踏鐙這類有分量的盔頭，不要上分賣力已經汗流浹背，熱不可富了；伺况勾好的彩色臉，雖是滿面的汗珠子，也不能用手巾去擦抹，向來唱花臉的角兒非用胖襖襯在身不足以顯示他的威武雄壯，熱不熱的問題，那也只好不去顧及了。還有一層，唱別的角兒，有時還能在臺上坐下休息一會，（應當落坐的塲子上）惟獨花而只能屁股靠在豎起很高的椅墊子的座位上，和站在那裏並無分別。至於武劇中一遇開打，還須穿着棉胖襖大打一氣，那就更要熱昏了。</p>
<p>唱靑衣因為要顯出亭亭玉立婀娜嬌弱的體態來，當然不能扮得臃腫不堪的樣兒。中國女子向以弱不禁風為美的條件，倘使內裏一襯棉衣，那就要影響到身段的美觀上，不是姿態呆笨，就是臺步不靈活。是以難在嚴冬的天氣，也得單褲單衫獻技於紅氍毺上，外面的靑軟子又係綢製，下面的白綾裙子，更不能靠他禦寒，而且舊時的戲館，叫而八方全都透風；倘遇着「敎子」祭塔「祭江」這種天段二黃慢板或三眼反二黃的戲，直挺挺的」點　步作工都沒有，迎着風喊唱半天，人不要凍僵了麽。（一八二）</p>

<p>Liuzhou: The Japanese army on the northern section of the Yongbin Road was repeatedly defeated by the Chinese army. The remaining few Japanese soldiers hiding in the mountains north of Qitang are being searched and annihilated. As of noon on the 15th, the area north of Dagao Peak Pass on the Yongwu Road has been completely cleared by the Chinese army. The remaining Japanese troops scattered in the mountains have been completely cleared as of yesterday noon after continuous searches by the Chinese army.

<p>Wengyuan: On the 12th, the Chinese army launched a surprise attack on the Japanese puppet troops in Chashan, southeast of Shilong on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. The Japanese could not hold and fled towards Shilong. The Chinese army then recovered Chashan and destroyed its puppet organizations. (Telegram on the 16th)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing: Part of the Japanese army in Xinhui harassed westward along the Xinkai Road on the afternoon of the 14th, and launched a fierce attack with artillery and cavalry support. The Chinese army ambushed along the way, and when the Japanese reached the vicinity of Liantang, they suddenly launched a fierce attack. The Japanese were attacked from both sides and fled in disorder, abandoning many corpses and military supplies. The Chinese army pursued and swept them away, capturing many. The remaining Japanese troops retreated towards the Da and Xiao Meishan area. (Telegram on the 16th)</p>

Reinforcements from various Chinese forces are arriving continuously and are fiercely attacking the Japanese army cornered in Gujing. (Telegram on the 16th)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing: On the morning of the 12th, more than ten armed motorboats fully loaded with Japanese soldiers were discovered on the Hengling Hukeng River surface in Xinhui, scouting back and forth.

<p>Guangzhou: Reuters has learned from reliable sources that the Japanese authorities here are currently considering a proposal from British businesses to improve the convenience of the Guangzhou docks. It is said that this proposal advocates that British ships sailing from Hong Kong be allowed to sail upstream along the Pearl River and dock at the various wharves of the Shipping Bureau, restoring the situation before the fall of Guangzhou. Although part of the Pearl River has been open for a year, transport ships are still not allowed to dock along the riverbank. Passengers on board, both Chinese and foreign, must be transported from the docks to Shamian. This is inconvenient for passengers, the Shamian Concession, and the Japanese authorities. This is because an average of a thousand Chinese passengers come to Guangzhou every week, first arriving in Shamian and then entering the city of Guangzhou through the British bridge, often causing disturbances and congestion. Furthermore, passengers are inspected at the dock and then inspected again by Japanese sentries outside the British bridge, repeating the same procedure. This is also considered troublesome by the Japanese. Although the British proposal is still under consideration and negotiations have not yet begun, as far as Reuters knows, there is considerable hope that the Japanese authorities will improve the convenience of the docks.

<h3>Speculation Creates Today's Prices</h3>
<p>The sharp and unparalleled rise in prices this spring has surprised many. They do not know that this is a plan by speculators before the settlement period. Some doubt this claim, wondering how speculators could organize with such agility and such great power, responding in unison and raising prices to such heights. But one must remember that today's speculators are all about "winning money to gamble," so they often risk everything on a single throw. Last winter, many stocked up goods for the new year, preparing for a big rise in prices during the spring market. They started by fabricating various rumors to confuse people and make everyone believe that prices would inevitably rise. Then, as long as the price of gold rose, they could follow like clouds following dragons and winds following tigers. Sure enough, when the spring market opened, the exchange rate was still loose, but the price of gold rose sharply. However, the externally strong but internally weak gold market was not enough to stimulate the interest of the speculative market. Therefore, in recent days, they have been working on both the exchange rate and gold markets. As a result, all industries and markets are controlled by speculators and lose their autonomy. In the few days since the Spring Festival market opened, no matter what goods, profits of two or three cents per unit were easily obtained. In addition, last year, the profits of various industries ranged from over ten million to several million or hundreds of thousands. With such exorbitant profits, how could one not create the power of speculators, making speculators even more excited and those who do not speculate also want to get involved, leading to today's situation where the entire market has become a speculative frenzy? However, this is also caused by the deteriorating environment and the chaotic situation.</p>
<p>This surge in prices cannot be explained by normal theories, and the psychology of speculators cannot be moved by interests. What is the use of simply calling for market adjustments and price stabilization? It is also impossible to expect them in the current situation. Does this mean that prices will continue to rise like a kite with a broken string? In today's situation, this may unfortunately become a reality. Then, will those who are law-abiding, do not manipulate, do not speculate, earn rewards through labor, and rely on wages to make a living be sacrificed by speculators? This is already the case in reality. However, people can adapt to the environment, and they can also improve the environment. In Shanghai as a whole, the speculators' manipulation this time is either based on evil forces or on the chaotic situation. They use their wealth and business skills to exploit the majority of people. This is one point. Moreover, the rise in prices this time is not entirely due to an increase in consumption, but hoarding is the main reason. The hoarded goods still exist and will eventually circulate in the market and be consumed by consumers. This is the second point. Therefore, the majority of people whose lives are oppressed, understand the psychology of speculators, which is beneficial to temporary storage but not to long-term storage. Over time, market changes become unpredictable, and interest and warehouse rent losses become unavoidable. Therefore, they often take advantage of temporary public panic to stir up trouble, relying on their agile capital to buy cheap and sell dear, harming the community. However, if they lose their reliance or support, they will come with their heads held high but leave with their tails between their legs. This is to be expected. For example, in the oil market last winter, when there were rumors that Dalian oil was coming to Shanghai, prices immediately dropped by more than ten yuan, and there were still few buyers. This spring, prices rose by sixteen yuan, and people were still vying to buy. It's not that there is no oil, it's just that people's sentiments are different. Then, how do we know that the goods hoarded by speculators today will not one day be available for sale when transportation is restored? Moreover, the natural result of skyrocketing prices will lead to a sudden decrease in general consumption, such as factories and boiled water businesses stopping operations due to the high cost of coal. From this perspective, giving speculators a blow depends on the resilience of consumers!</p>
<p>To stabilize prices, the active aspect lies in adjusting supply and demand and corresponding production and sales. This can be discussed in normal times but cannot be sought in times of chaos. The passive aspect is to naturally save due to the habit of expensive goods. Thrift is originally a virtue, but in the environment of Shanghai, it may be considered stingy or pedantic. However, even middle-class families today may not be able to survive without thrift. Thrift means limiting consumption and reducing purchasing power. From the standpoint of producers, this is not a good sign. However, to cope with rising prices and rampant speculation, without doing so, it would be creating opportunities for them! I have heard about the living conditions of the Japanese. Due to the exhaustion of hydropower and the lack of coal reserves, they have had to reduce electricity supply. As a result, every household is using candles instead of electricity. Tap water is only available for two hours a day, and everyone is saving on water. Due to poor rice harvests, they are forced to save on lunch and not eat too much, replacing it with potatoes and other fruits. Even for something as small as matches, because their materials can be used to make ammunition, they are limiting each person to four matches per day. All of this has been mentioned in questions in the Japanese Diet, so it is not without reason. Because they are affected by the war, their economy is exhausted, and they have no choice but to implement extreme austerity. Other countries at war, such as Britain and France, are also advocating thrift so that all their material and financial resources can be used for the war and to win the final victory. But looking back at the lives of the people in Shanghai, they are still extravagant and wasteful, as if today's prosperity and superficial wealth are something that can be enjoyed for a long time. They do not realize that the result of waste will eventually be a day when they have nothing to rely on. Therefore, even without the surge in prices, they should be thrifty. Moreover, today, due to the manipulation of speculators, prices are soaring, posing a serious threat to general life. This is something that no one can deny. Speculators only know how to harm others for their own benefit and disregard the lives of their compatriots. The authorities are at a loss to stop speculation. Therefore, if ordinary people do not make plans early and reduce their standard of living as much as possible, and continue to enjoy themselves as usual, they will not only fail to crush the arrogance of speculators, but they may also fall into the trap of speculators and become sacrifices. This should start from each individual, creating a culture of thrift, not being ashamed to wear patched clothes, and not changing their happiness despite eating meager meals. If this is considered impractical, if prices continue to rise without change, there will eventually be an unfortunate day when this comes true.</p>
<h3>Japan Hopes to Resolve U.S. Issues; Tokyo Talks to Resume; U.S. Anti-Japan Movement Deep-Rooted; Arita Warns Japanese Not to Be Optimistic; Hull Says He Has Not Heard of Japan Protesting Loans to China</h3>
<p>Washington: According to usually reliable Japanese sources yesterday, the resumption of the Yangtze River may be implemented on March 1. At the same time, Japanese sources outlined the following three future developments, which they say could ease tensions between the U.S. and Japan: (1) Japanese-U.S. diplomatic talks in Tokyo will resume in two or three weeks to resolve disputes between the two countries caused by the China issue. (2) Progress is expected in handling various loss claims made by the United States. (3) The U.S. Senate will indefinitely postpone considering bills to impose embargoes on Japan. According to news obtained from a certain Japanese source, the Japanese government has agreed to reopen the Yangtze River. It believes that implementation will take two months. Although this is considered too optimistic, judging from the current situation, the reopening of the Yangtze River may be implemented in early March. It is reported that the Japanese side will allow navigation to Nanjing. Regarding regulations for foreign ships, the Japanese side will adopt the most tolerant approach. Foreign Minister Arita Hachiro will resume the Tokyo talks after attending the plenary session of the Diet's Budget Committee. Japan believes that the U.S. Senate's postponement of considering the embargo issue is beneficial to U.S.-Japan relations, as the embargo bill is unlikely to be enacted for a considerable period of time. Although discussions on the embargo issue may resume at any time, fair observers here believe that the State Department has warned the Senate Foreign Relations Committee against taking early embargo action against Japan. (United Press telegram on the 16th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: "The Hochi Shimbun stated in an article today that the U.S. Congress's decision to postpone considering the embargo on Japan can only prevent the breakdown of Japanese-U.S. relations. The U.S. Congress passing an embargo bill against Japan would inevitably provoke Japanese retaliation, namely, abolishing the Nine-Power Treaty and declaring war on China. The newspaper called on the United States to reconsider its naval expansion program so that U.S.-Japan relations could be clarified. (United Press telegram on the 16th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Foreign Minister Arita stated in the House of Representatives today in response to a question about the anti-Japanese embargo bill currently before the U.S. Congress, expressing hope that the United States will recognize that large-scale warfare is still taking place in China, and revise its demands on Japan. He also said that due to Japan's reaction and the situation in Europe, the bill may be postponed for discussion. However, the Japanese should not be optimistic about it, as the anti-Japanese embargo movement in the United States has deep roots and is widespread, with a large number of supporters. In addition, the forces of the environment must also be considered. The Foreign Minister was referred to, stating that the anti-Japanese embargo movement in the United States also has a considerable possibility of eventually disappearing, especially because there are quite a few farsighted people in the United States. In short, the Japanese government intends to resolve all outstanding issues with the United States as much as possible. A certain Diet member then spoke, saying that in view of the tense relations between Japan and the United States, the government should be urged to take forceful steps to store liquid fuel. Commerce Minister Fujiwara replied that the government has already prepared a concrete plan to cope with any situation caused by the United States prohibiting the export of oil to Japan, but it is difficult to release details. The Commerce Minister has assured the Diet member that preparations for the worst-case scenario have been completed. (Reuters telegram on the 16th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Arita admitted in the House of Representatives Budget Committee today that it is very difficult for Japan and the United States to conclude a new commercial treaty, but to give up hope of concluding a new commercial treaty would also be unwise. Therefore, the only way forward at the moment is to try to prevent the current situation between the two countries from deteriorating further. (United Press telegram on the 16th)</p>
<p>Washington: Secretary of State Hull made a statement to the press stating that the State Department has not heard of rumors that Japan would protest if the United States were to provide further credit to China. (Havas telegram on the 15th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Central Daily News commented on the United States' continued loans to China today, stating that this action by the United States is sufficient to prove its determination to uphold justice, fairness, the rule of law, and its traditional Far Eastern policy. Of course, the Chinese people are deeply grateful for this attitude of the United States. The Chinese people have always known that the United States is a friend in need. The report concluded that various forms of assistance from friendly countries to China will strengthen the Chinese people's determination to continue fighting Japan. (United Press telegram on the 16th)</p>
<h3>Japanese House of Representatives Continues Budget Debate; Hata Shunroku Reports on Military Reorganization</h3>
<p>Tokyo: When the House of Representatives continued the budget debate today, discussions were held on issues such as the army's military reorganization plan, expanding industrial output, organizing an independent air force, and aiding China's "new central government." Lieutenant General Yanagawa, Secretary-General of the House of Representatives, declared that if the war continues for a long time, the Japanese army will have to provide the "new central government" of China with military, political, and economic assistance, but this assistance is intended to enable the new regime to become self-reliant as soon as possible. Yanagawa also agreed to do his best to maintain the value of Japanese military scrip circulating in China. Naval Minister Yoshida said that the Navy has no intention of making the naval air force independent. Army Minister Hata Shunroku said in response to a question from a certain Diet member that the military reorganization plan was formulated based on the situation in 1937, but the outbreak of the China incident and the changes in the international situation have made it necessary to revise this plan. He expects that this plan will be fully implemented by 1943, or at the latest by 1945. The President of the Planning Board also declared that the first phase of expanding industrial output cooperation between China, Japan, and Manchukuo will be completed in 1941. At the same time, a plan will be implemented to import important goods from all aspects as much as possible, without relying on one or two countries. (Reuters telegram on the 16th)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Yen Bloc Abuses Issuance of Banknotes; Circulation Significantly Increased</h3>
<p>Tokyo: According to a report submitted by the Ministry of Finance to the House of Representatives Budget Committee, the amount of various banknotes in circulation in the Japanese yen bloc has increased by 4% compared to a year ago. This includes banknotes from the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Taiwan, the Bank of Korea, the "North China Reserve Bank," the "Inner Mongolia Bank," the "Chinese Commercial Bank," and the "Manchukuo United Bank." At the beginning of this year, the circulation of banknotes from the above banks was 5,547,102,000 yen. Among them, the Bank of Japan's banknotes increased from 2,754,923,000 yen at the end of last year to 3,679,031,000 yen, an increase of 33%. (United Press telegram on the 16th)</p>
<h3>US Republican Party Planning to Convene a Conference to Nominate a Presidential Candidate</h3>
<p>Washington: This year's general election Republican candidate will be nominated by the party's National Convention. The party's Executive Committee has scheduled a meeting for the 16th to determine the date and location of the National Convention. According to the Executive Committee's organizational rules, the date of the National Convention should be announced four months in advance. Therefore, this year's conference cannot be held until June 17th at the earliest. Once the date of the conference is set, the chairman of the Democratic Party's Executive Committee, who is also the current Postmaster General Farley, will also determine the date of the party's National Convention. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>Newspaper Attacks Government: Secrecy in All Matters is a Suicidal Policy; People Being Kept in the Dark Makes Cooperation Difficult</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The "Nichinichi Shimbun" and "Asahi Shimbun" today criticized the Japanese government's policy of secrecy in all matters. The "Nichinichi Shimbun" stated that since newspapers cannot find out what is discussed in various secret meetings, the general public certainly has no way of knowing. At the same time, ministers are also unable to provide clear and detailed answers to the questions of parliamentarians. "If the people are always kept in the dark and have no way of knowing about issues that affect them, it will be difficult to fully cooperate with the government. The government on the one hand asks the people to cooperate with it, and on the other hand adopts a policy of secrecy. This attitude is not only selfish but also suicidal." According to the "Asahi Shimbun," "The current cabinet lacks creativity and is almost no different from the Hiranuma Cabinet and the Abe Cabinet. What we don't understand is why the cabinet also holds secret meetings on matters that have nothing to do with military affairs, and does not let people know. In short, except for military affairs, we really don't know why everything must be kept secret." (United Press dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>France Resents Japanese Aggression: Renewal of Commercial Treaty Unlikely; Tokyo Pays Attention to the Progress of Negotiations; Japanese Personnel Already Consider it a Matter of Concern</h3>
<p>Tokyo: It is learned here that the Japanese Ambassador to France, Sawada, after arriving in Paris before the end of last year, immediately negotiated with France regarding the renewal of the Franco-Japanese Commercial Treaty. It is noted that the current Franco-Japanese commercial relationship went into effect on March 15th of last year and is due to expire on the same date this year. However, Japanese personnel concerned about this matter consider it unlikely that the commercial treaty will be renewed on the same terms, because in 1907, France and Japan established an agreement stipulating that both sides would help each other to protect the peace and security of the Chinese region adjacent to the territories of France and Japan. Since Japan has completely disregarded this agreement and invaded Hainan Island and its nearby Chinese territories, and has extensively bombed the French-funded Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, France's animosity towards Japan must have greatly increased. Therefore, Tokyo is currently paying close attention to the progress of the current negotiations. It is noted that last year Japan enjoyed considerable commercial convenience in France and Vietnam, Syria, Morocco, Tunisia, New Caledonia, and other French territories. Japan's exports to these areas exceeded £3,750,000, and imports exceeded £2,700,000. Japan's exports are mostly canned goods, poppy fish and other foods, as well as pottery and silk, while it imports large quantities of military supplies from France, salt from Tunisia, and rubber and coal from Vietnam.

<h3>Woodward Advocates Rapid Expansion of the Navy</h3>
<p>Newark: According to Rear Admiral Woodward, commander of the U.S. Third Naval District, speaking at the Eastern Security Conference today, the U.S. Navy urgently needs to be rapidly expanded, because its distance from the "realm of being second to none" is too great. The current U.S. Navy is not as good as Britain's, and is not much stronger than Japan's. It is noted that at the end of the last war, the U.S. Navy could be described as second to none in the world, but after the Washington Conference and the London Conference, it was reduced to a third-rate navy. Since 1933, the U.S. Navy has seen improvement, but it still ranks second, and Japan is closely following behind. Finally, Woodward stated that the cost of expanding the navy is negligible compared to the national defense security gained. Therefore, he advocated that the U.S. Navy must be expanded to the point where it is not determined by any country. (United Press dispatch on the 16th)</p>

<h3>U.S. Treasury and Postal Departments' Next Fiscal Year Budget Amendment Passed; Senator Clark's Proposal to Cancel Aviation Station in British Territory Rejected</h3>
<p>Washington: Regarding the budget案 for the Treasury Department and the Postal Department for the next fiscal year, the Senate has just passed an amendment today, with a total amount of $1,032,794,115, which is $11 million less than the original proposal submitted by President Roosevelt.

This proposal was just rejected by the Senate with 46 votes against 25. It is noted that the British authorities in the Bermuda Islands previously inspected the mail carried by the U.S. airmail plane "Clipper" to Europe, which caused deep dissatisfaction in American public opinion, hence the proposal to cancel the aviation station in the islands.

<h3>Soviet Offensive Reaches Peak; Part of Mannerheim Line Breached; Finnish Troops in Summa Area Retreat to Second Line of Defense; Red Army Cavalry Crossing Frozen Lake Repelled by Artillery Fire</h3>
<p>Helsinki: Regarding the Soviet troops breaching the Mannerheim Line yesterday, Finnish officials have acknowledged this today. According to unconfirmed reports, the Finnish line was breached in two locations: Summa and the Taipale River. (Haitong dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: According to a message received here from Helsinki, the Finnish troops in the Summa area, under continuous heavy attacks by the Soviet army, withdrew from the first line of the Mannerheim Line at midnight on Wednesday. (United Press dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: The Soviet army is now attacking from a broader front. The two armies north of the Karelian Isthmus are now only separated by the narrow Taipale River. The Soviet troops currently attacking Summa and Taipale have greatly increased compared to before. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: Finnish personnel here have recently declared that although the Soviet Union has launched a large-scale offensive on the Mannerheim Line in recent days, and although its offensive has reached its peak, the Mannerheim Line has remained unmoved for several days. The terrain lost by the Finnish army is still limited. In addition, a Red Army cavalry unit launched an offensive on the frozen sea surface of the Gulf of Finland yesterday, attempting to attack the Finnish army's right flank, but was repelled by artillery fire from the Bjoerkoe Island fortress. This cavalry unit is entirely composed of natives from the Caucasus, whose combat strength is stronger than that of the Russians. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: It is learned here that the Finnish army has been forced to withdraw from the first line of defense of the Mannerheim Line in the Summa area. The Soviet army is concentrating its attacks on four locations: Summa, Onnela, Taipale, and east of Lake Muolaa. The battle in the Summa area is fierce, and both sides have suffered heavy losses. The Finnish army on the Karelian front has retreated to the second line of defense in the west, and is still holding the first line of defense in the east, but the Soviet offensive is very fierce. The Soviet army northeast of Lake Ladoga is still fiercely attacking along the railway. There is also fighting on the Koihm front. (Haitong dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Because Finland lacks fresh reserve troops, it is very concerned about the position of the Karelian Isthmus. However, some of the forward positions of the Mannerheim Line occupied by the Soviet army have been retaken by the Finnish army. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: The Soviet army's attack on the Mannerheim Line intensified yesterday, advancing along the new line. However, the Finnish troops in various places all seem to be firmly defending Summa, the ice on Lake Muolaanjärvi north of it, and the Taipale area. The Soviet army is attacking the Finnish army fiercely again. If it wins on the lake, the Finnish army will suffer a major blow, because the Soviet army can reach one of the important roads leading to Viipuri. However, in order to attack on the lake, the Soviet army must advance ten miles across the lake, and will inevitably encounter the Finnish firepower hidden in the surrounding forests, with no cover. Furthermore, the two to four feet of snow on the ice makes it even more difficult for the Soviet army to advance. (Reuters</p>
<p>Helsinki: The Soviet army's offensive towards the southern Summa area has now become increasingly active, and its artillery fire is extremely fierce. According to a Finnish officer, the Red Army fired more than 200 rounds of artillery at a small position guarded by a Finnish army company. It is not difficult to imagine the situation in other places. The Finnish Bjoerkoe Island fortress retaliated, not only deterring the Red Army's offensive, but also bombarding its rear positions. As a result of the fierce battle between the two sides, both sides had gains and losses. The Finnish army destroyed a total of thirteen Soviet tanks and killed a thousand Red Army officers and soldiers. In addition, two Red Army divisions launched a fierce attack in the Taipale River area, but failed and retreated with the loss of 2,500 officers and soldiers. According to observers here, although the Finnish army resisted fiercely, the government authorities only recently called up reserve soldiers born in 1896 and 1897, and will have no more soldiers to mobilize in the future. Therefore, the situation on the front line is not optimistic. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>Soviet-Finnish War Report</h3>
<p>Moscow: According to a communique from the Leningrad Military District Headquarters, yesterday the Soviet troops continued to fight successfully in the Karelian Isthmus, forcing the enemy to retreat, abandoning a lot of military supplies, and suffering heavy damage. The Soviet army has now approached Kamara. As a result of yesterday's battle, the Soviet army recaptured 53 fortifications, including 21 solid artillery positions. In other areas, there were also reconnaissance team activities and infantry clashes. The Soviet Air Force bombed enemy troops and enemy military targets very successfully. Six enemy aircraft were shot down in air combat. (TASS dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Last night's communique here stated that the Soviet troops continued to attack on the entire front line. Their attempt to break through the ice in the Gulf of Finland has been repelled. As a result of the Soviet army's attack in Muolaanjärvi, a thousand people were killed and thirteen tanks were destroyed. In the Taipale area, the Finnish army repeatedly resisted and remained unmoved. It is estimated that 2,500 Soviet soldiers were killed in this area. In the Summa area, the Finnish army also repelled all attacks. The Soviet army northeast of Lake Ladoga attacked several times but did not succeed. The Soviet army also destroyed a hundred teams of Finnish food transportation convoys. The Finnish coastal artillery team on the Karelian Isthmus has repelled the Soviet attempt to cross the ice. Finnish aircraft attacked Soviet troop concentrations and food storage areas. Yesterday, sixteen Soviet military aircraft were shot down in Finnish territory, and another bomber was forced to land in Finnish territory. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>Lake Ladoga North: According to Finnish officers today, in the Karuntai area on the northeastern wall of Lake Ladoga in central Finland, there are 10,000 Finnish soldiers killed and about 40,000 wounded. It is noted that the Soviet army in this area has three divisions, which caused great tension for the Finnish side in the middle of last month. However, the situation has now turned from danger to safety, and the Red Army's position has become more precarious. Every night, the Finnish army is sure to use supernatural methods to carry out extremely fierce night attacks on the Soviet army, while continuously firing at them with heavy artillery. The Red Army in that area is now gradually withdrawing. In short, in terms of all front lines, it can be said that all parties have reported victories. (United Press dispatch on the 16th)</p>

In addition, the treatment of Finnish wounded and sick in Sweden has also been taken care of. Finnish government personnel have repeatedly raised the issue of manpower supply when they come here. Most recently, the Finnish Foreign Minister raised this issue on February 13. However, the Swedish government's policy remains unchanged. According to reports here, the Finnish government has notified Sweden that it may be difficult to support itself for long, and unless Sweden assists with two divisions of volunteer soldiers, it will have to seek assistance from Western European countries.

<p>London: The trade negotiations recently conducted between Britain and Italy have encountered difficulties. According to political figures here, Italy needs various raw materials for the negotiations to be successful. Therefore, the British government does not attach much importance to these difficulties. However, Italy's policy has "gone astray" at this time, and it is difficult to predict when it will change course. In any case, the British government will not do anything to please Italy and thus resolve the difficulties in the negotiation agenda. Since the difficulties were caused by Italy, it should be initiated by that country to remedy them. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)</p>

<h3>Rumors that German and Soviet General Staffs Have Agreed on Military Cooperation Methods to Prevent British and French Interference in Eastern European War; Germany Can Handle the Western Front Alone</h3>
<p>Bern: The "Ticino Post" recently published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating that the German and Soviet General Staffs have actually agreed on military cooperation methods. German political figures generally say that even if the current European war expands its scope and other countries join it in the future, Germany is prepared for any eventuality. According to the cooperation plan agreed upon by Germany and the Soviet Union, if Britain, France, or any neutral country endangers the Soviet Union's position, Germany will immediately join the Finnish-Soviet war. If the Soviet Union is threatened in southern Europe or the Danube region, Germany will also intervene. It is reported that Chancellor Hitler also intends to make a speech in the near future to explain the relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: A newspaper's Berlin dispatch states that German officials firmly deny overseas rumors that the Soviet Union and Germany have signed a military alliance. German Foreign Ministry personnel believe that this news is due to the satisfactory conclusion of a commercial agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union, and claim that Germany does not need Soviet assistance and is sufficient to defeat Britain and France alone. The dispatch continued, saying that Germany does not want military assistance, but hopes that neutral neighboring countries will supply raw materials so that Germany can break the Allied blockade. Berlin officials are of course closely monitoring the results of Britain and France's appeal to neutral countries to participate in the war, while also claiming that Germany does not want to see Italy and the Soviet Union join the war against the Allied countries.

<h3>Moscow Newspaper Commentary: The Soviet-German Economic Agreement Possesses Significant Political Character; Stipulates Germany's Assistance to the USSR with Military Supplies</h3>
<p>Moscow - "Izvestia" commented today, stating, "The economic agreement established between the Soviet Union and Germany on February 11th is extremely important, both economically and politically. This agreement is based on the common interests of both countries. In fact, political and economic cooperation between the two countries began long ago as a result of the trade and credit treaty concluded in August 1939. The economic agreement that has now been established proves that political and economic cooperation between the two countries will inevitably become even closer. The establishment of the Soviet-German trade and credit treaty occurred at a time of serious political relations, and its purpose was to eliminate this serious atmosphere and further improve political and economic relations between the two countries. In fact, after the treaty was established, the Soviet Union and Germany signed a non-aggression pact on August 23, 1939, and a treaty of friendship and borders was established in September of the same year. With the signing of these various agreements, Soviet-German economic and political relations entered a new phase. Undoubtedly, after the implementation of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Treaty, the total trade volume stipulated in the trade and credit treaty was deemed insufficient. Therefore, during political negotiations held in September 1939, both parties unanimously expressed their efforts to further deepen economic relations. The results of both parties' efforts have been confirmed by the documents exchanged on September 28, 1939, by Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, and the German Foreign Minister. September 28th was the date of the signing of the Soviet-German Treaty of Friendship and Borders.</p>
<p>"Furthermore, this document stipulates that both parties will strive to develop economic relations. Therefore, both parties decided to draft an economic plan to ensure that the total trade volume between Germany and the Soviet Union reaches an unprecedented record high. Regarding this point, the German economic delegation conducted negotiations with the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Trade. After several months of negotiations, the Soviet Union and Germany finally established an economic agreement on February 11th of this year. The Soviet Union is the country with the richest raw materials in the world, and raw materials are extremely needed by the German side. On the other hand, Germany is the world's leading manufacturer of high-quality machinery. Although the Soviet Union's machinery industry is very developed, it has continued to import a large number of German machines in recent years. According to the German-Soviet agreement, the Soviet Union will supply raw materials to Germany, while Germany will export industrial products (including military supplies) to the Soviet Union. Furthermore, in the first year of the agreement's implementation, the total trade volume between the two countries will exceed any figure for trade between the two countries since the World War. Both parties will strive to continue to increase the supply as much as possible. The agreement stipulates that the Soviet Union will supply a large amount of raw materials to Germany, which is very important, as Germany is currently in need of a large supply of raw materials due to the blockade by the Allied countries.</p>
<p>"The German-Soviet economic agreement will also enable the Soviet Union to expand its foreign trade. The Soviet Union's foreign trade has been greatly affected by the obstruction of the United Kingdom and France, but this difficulty has been eliminated due to the signing of the German-Soviet economic agreement. Even before the outbreak of the war, the Soviet Union had ordered goods from British and French factories, but the United Kingdom and France cancelled the orders, thereby severing trade relations with the Soviet Union and suffering losses themselves. Since the Soviet Union cannot obtain goods from the United Kingdom and France, it does not need to transport goods to the United Kingdom and France. The French government recently imitated London's bad actions of 1927, searching the Soviet trade representative in Paris with actions akin to bandits. Under such circumstances, how can we conduct normal trade relations with the French side? Currently, the Soviet Union's industry and agriculture are both extremely developed and no longer need to rely on foreign countries. At the same time, due to the development of economic strength, the Soviet Union can also do without the help of the United Kingdom and France. The Soviet Union has increased trade with Germany. In short, Germany and the Soviet Union are both willing to work hard to establish a permanent economic cooperation between the two countries. The trade agreement of August 19, 1939, has been successfully implemented by both Germany and the Soviet Union, and as a result, the economic relations between the two countries have greatly improved. The economic agreement signed on February 11th of this year will definitely bring the trade between the two countries to the highest point, exceeding any previous figure, and will be extremely beneficial to both parties. The political relations between the Soviet Union and Germany have greatly improved at the end of last year. The economic agreement currently signed proves that this friendly relationship has become even closer and has laid a very solid foundation for future development." (TASS dispatch, 16th)</p>

<h3>General Göring's Speech: Encourages Farmers to Strive for Production to Meet Wartime Needs; Germany is Confident of Being Invincible in Military and Economic Terms; One Million Poles Forced to Assist in Farming</h3>
<p>Berlin - General Göring, Minister of Aviation, delivered his first broadcast speech to German farmers yesterday since the start of the war last September, explaining the basic principles of the "1940 Production War." He declared, "In economic terms, we cannot be overcome. In military terms, we are even more difficult to defeat. Morale is especially unconquerable." Göring stated that Germany has already stockpiled seven million tons of grain, and the government has taken measures to help German farmers increase agricultural production as much as possible. The United Kingdom and France are now repeating their old tricks, trying to destroy the German nation with an economic blockade, but the German economic system cannot repeat the mistakes of 1918 because it was already organized in peacetime. Germany's transportation to the east, south, and north is now secure, and the economic foundations of agriculture, industry, and commerce are stable. Fortunately, we have not wasted a minute in the past few years. Although there is a shortage of raw materials, thanks to hard work and the inventions of German inventors, there are already a large number of substitutes, which are even better than foreign raw materials. Therefore, we cannot be overcome in economic terms, and we are even more difficult to defeat in military terms. Morale and public opinion are especially unconquerable. The United Kingdom should recognize this.</p>
<p>Göring went on to say that the British Empire has three founding principles: (1) economic exploitation, (2) the use of violence, and (3) the commission of many injustices. Its consistent weapon is "fabricating rumors and propaganda." These principles and methods are no longer applicable to Germany today. The wealthy United Kingdom is now copying the German rationing system for food, and the amount of rations is even smaller than in Germany, which is ridiculous. It must be known that it is difficult for the United Kingdom to copy National Socialist methods in a short period of time, because its consistent financial system cannot be overthrown in a hurry. We believe that the United Kingdom must have reserves, but these reserves are far overseas, and because of the activity of our submarines, they have sunk to the bottom of the sea off the coast of the United Kingdom. However, our stockpiles of grain, potatoes, sugar, and oilseeds are all within Germany and are not subject to external destruction. Göring then asked German farm women to work hard in the fields, as farmers on the front lines cannot be transferred back to their hometowns, but the government will mobilize youth and one million Poles and prisoners of war to assist in this spring's agricultural work. At the same time, farmers in the military with special skills and specialized agricultural experience will also be exempt from military service and return to rural areas to work. As for the participation of foreign farmers, it is not, as Paris and London claim, the result of violence and threats, but rather they are happy and willing to seek paid work in Germany. Göring went on to say that all the horses, machinery, farm implements, fuel, and fertilizers needed for this spring's agricultural work have been fully prepared, and the transportation problem has also been addressed.</p>
<p>Göring then put forward the phrase "1940 Production War" as a slogan for German farmers, emphasizing that every acre of land should be fully utilized. The British blockade of Germany is called a "fat blockade" because its specific purpose is to cut off Germany's fat supply. Therefore, Germany must strive for fat production in order to smash the British plan. The specific measures to increase fat production are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Increase the area of land planted with oilseeds by 500,000 acres, with special bonuses for those with particularly abundant yields. (2) Increase the amount of sugar beets and potatoes by at least 10% to 15% on each farm. (3) Convert grassland to farmland, with the government providing a subsidy of 240 marks per two and a half acres. (4) Increase the production of milk and butter, with the government encouraging it with bonuses. At the same time, farmers are advised to use less milk in order to make butter to replace imported products.</p>
<p>Finally, Göring asked German farmers to maintain confidence and continue to fight, and after shouting the slogans "Victory belongs to us" and "Heil Hitler," the meeting was adjourned. (Haitong dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Paris - General Göring, Germany's four-year economic dictator, recently gave a speech to farmers throughout the country, which has been commented on by political figures here. It is noteworthy that Göring did not mention a word about the agricultural products that Central European countries, especially the Soviet Union, could supply to Germany. Because after the German-Soviet economic agreement was signed in Moscow on the 12th of this month, German newspapers have praised the government for obtaining an infinite supply of raw materials for the people. Unexpectedly, Göring's speech this time only promoted economic self-sufficiency and encouraged the people to work hard and improve production methods in order to increase production. It can be clearly seen from this that Germany does not believe that it can rely on the Soviet Union and other countries economically in the long run. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>London - General Göring, Germany's four-year economic plan dictator, delivered a speech to farmers throughout the country yesterday, which has been commented on by various newspapers here. In addition to the usual criticism of the United Kingdom, there are two main points in the speech: one is that he asked farmers throughout the country to bury themselves in production in a very serious tone, and the other is that he confirmed that the German authorities have transferred one million people from Poland to Germany to engage in cultivation. The Labor Party's newspaper, "Daily Herald," stated that the Polish people have been subjected to abuse by the German authorities, which is the most cruel means of oppression in modern times. The Liberal Party's "News Chronicle" stated that there are already 200,000 Polish civilians in Germany who have been reduced to slavery, in addition to prisoners of war, and that these people are definitely not willing to go to Germany. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Switzerland - General Göring's speech yesterday afternoon has been released by the semi-official German News Agency in the country, but important sections on the lack of artificial coal have been deleted. German morning newspapers claimed that the speech arrived at the editorial department too late and have not yet published it. The reason for this is still unknown. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>British Secretary of War Inspects the Western Front; Lord Milne Accompanies Him</h3>
<p>Amsterdam - British Secretary of War Stanley, accompanied by Lord Milne, is currently inspecting the British forces stationed on the Western Front in France. Lord Milne's visit to the front lines has attracted the attention of political figures. Lord Milne commanded the British Salonika Army in World War I. From 1926 to 1933, he served as Chief of the General Staff of the British Army. Lord Milne advocated taking the offensive in this decisive battle. Hart had written an article in the "Daily Express" weekly criticizing it. (Haitong dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Paris - Snow continues to fall on the Western Front. West of the Vosges Mountains, artillery battles between the two sides are more intense than usual. Air activity is almost zero, but French aircraft occasionally fly over German lines for reconnaissance. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>The Maginot Line is as Solid as a Rock; German Blitzkrieg Tactics Will Have No Place to Use</h3>
<p>London - Lieutenant General Swinton said in a broadcast speech today that Germany has manufactured a large number of heavy tanks, which are large in size, heavily armored, and equipped with flamethrowers and small cannons. They are used to form an vanguard in the hope of achieving a quick victory. When the German army advanced to Austria, the Czech Republic, and Poland, it used these tanks as a guide. However, it should be noted that this vanguard has never encountered obstacles equivalent to the Maginot Line. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3>German Submarines Rampant in Various European Waters; Attempting to Cut Off Overseas Trade of Neutral Countries; Dutch Ships Sunk, Netherlands Protests to Germany</h3>
<p>London - A correspondent for the "Daily Telegraph" in Danzig reported that the German submarine fleet is about to launch a general offensive against merchant ships of various neutral countries. The country's naval department has received an order from Führer Hitler to conduct unrestricted submarine warfare in all parts of the world, on a scale even greater than that dreamed of by Grand Admiral Tirpitz, former commander of the German Navy, during the last European War. Recently, Dutch, Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish ships have been sunk by German submarines. Although the country's naval spokesman said that "this action is in full compliance with international naval warfare regulations," in reality, this is just the prelude to Germany's attempt to cut off the overseas trade of various neutral countries. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>The Hague - It is heard that the Dutch government has lodged a stern verbal protest with the German government regarding the sinking of the Dutch ship "Borgedyk" by torpedo before submitting a written protest. It is heard that the Netherlands will demand full compensation from Germany. Responsible parties claim that although it is possible that the German submarine commander may have acted against orders, the German government cannot escape responsibility for absolutely unreasonable actions.

<h3>Several More Shipwrecks</h3>
<p>Genoa, Italy - The Italian ship "Gioacchino Orseolo" (5,649 tons), which was sailing to Keyser, New York, in the United States to load a large amount of coal to return home for use by the Italian railways, sank yesterday in the eastern waters of the United Kingdom after hitting a mine. This is the third Italian ship to sink after hitting a mine. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>London - The wreckage of the Italian freighter "Orseolo" (5,694 tons), which sank after hitting a mine yesterday, was discovered today near the east coast of England. Seventeen of the thirty-two crew members have been rescued. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>London - The Danish ship Dragon (04 tons) and the Sleipner (006 tons) were torpedoed and sunk in the early hours of this morning off the coast of the East Sea of England. Six people were rescued from the first ship and six passengers and sailors were rescued from the second ship. A Norwegian shipwreck was found floating off the coast of Scotland due to ocean currents. Its name is vague and unclear. It is found that two ships that recently left England for Norway have not arrived on time. One is the "Bissau" (1,000 tons). According to news from Norway today, it has not arrived at its destination as scheduled, and it is feared that it has encountered danger. The other ship, "Bygdøy," left a certain port in the country nine days after it set sail. So far, there has been no trace of it. All sectors in Norway believe that the shipwreck seen off the coast of Scotland may be one of these two ships. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>British Warship Sinks Two German Submarines</h3>
<p>Oslo - Newspapers reported that a German submarine attempted to launch a torpedo to sink a Norwegian ship, but before the torpedo was launched, the submarine exploded and sank, apparently sunk by a British destroyer. At that time, the crew of the Norwegian ship and the thirty-three distressed crew members rescued from the Norwegian motor ship "Snarøsund" had already abandoned ship and escaped by boat, but seeing the submarine sink, they returned to the ship and safely sailed to Bergen. The "Snarøsund" (4,114 tons) was torpedoed and sunk on its way to the Americas on Sunday. The crew escaped by boat because they received a warning in advance. The next day, they were rescued by another Norwegian ship. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>After the British freighter "Sultan Star" was sunk by a German submarine in the Atlantic Ocean the day before yesterday, its owner and crew arrived here today. According to the owner, the ship was carrying 8,000 tons of refrigerated meat and a batch of butter. After sinking the ship, the German submarine was sunk by a British warship. It is suspected that the submarine's original intention was to wait for the British battleship "Repulse" or the cruiser "Exeter" to pass by and attack them.</p>

<h3>American Countries to Exchange Diplomatic Opinions on German Note; Washington Political Circles Advocate Detaining British, French, and German Ships; Forcing Those Countries to Recognize the American Security Zone</h3>
<p>Washington - US Secretary of State Hull refused to criticize the German government's note to the Panamanian government at a press conference at the White House today. The German note protested that we recognize the naval warfare outside the port of Montevideo, which is a violation of American neutrality. Hull stated that the US government must receive a formal German note before it can comment. Hull believes that the German note will definitely become a topic for American countries to exchange diplomatic opinions. (Haitong dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Washington - When Secretary of State Hull met with reporters, a reporter asked about the news reported by Berlin yesterday that if American ships sailed to British and French ports, German submarines would use torpedoes to sink them. The Secretary of State immediately replied that, as of now, the State Department has only received a report from the US Embassy in Germany stating that a reporter from a Berlin radio station made this statement, but the truth of the matter is still unclear and needs to be investigated further. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Washington - After the German government officially published its response to the Panama Declaration, people close to the State Department commented that Germany's attitude was not surprising, because it did not recognize the British, French, and German security zone at all. Political figures in Washington are therefore discussing how to make the security zone recognized, and advocate detaining all the ships of the United Kingdom, France, and Germany currently in the ports of American countries in order to force those countries to recognize the security zone. Official sources said that the American countries are currently exchanging opinions on this matter. (Haitong dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Washington - Senator Pittman, chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said yesterday that if the United Kingdom does not implement a blockade policy, the risk of American ships being torpedoed will be reduced. Other senators agreed with this view. (Haitong dispatch, 16th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Reinforcements in Northern Guangdong, Major Battle Brewing Again in Xin Jie, Japanese Front Lines at Conghua and Hua County, Chinese Troops Have Advanced and Surrounded Longxiang and Other Places</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: The war in northern Guangdong, since the Chinese army's counter-offensive forced the Japanese army back to Xin Jie, continues to advance. The Japanese troops in Conghua and Hua County have also retreated to Shengang, Lianglong, and other places. However, according to frontline news on the 4th, the Japanese army reinforced Xin Jie on the 2nd and 3rd, seemingly with the intention of attacking again. A major battle is brewing once more on the front lines of the Guangdong Railway. The Chinese army is closely monitoring and ready to block any attack.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting Occurs in the Lianglong Area</p>
<p>The Chinese army on the Guanghua Road in northern Guangdong has launched frequent attacks in the past ten days, successively defeating the Japanese and puppet troops in Longkou, Xiangshan, and other places, and encircling Longxiang (northeast of Xin Jie). The Japanese army urgently requested reinforcements from Guangzhou and resisted with fortifications. On the 3rd and 4th, several hundred troops were reinforced from Yu Bei. On the morning of the 5th, a mixed Japanese force of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, numbering over 400, carrying light and heavy artillery pieces, advanced from Longxiang along Longkou towards Pingshan and Lianglong (south of Hua County), attempting to break through the front lines of the Chinese army on the Guanghua Line. A certain unit of the Chinese army stationed in Hua County rose up to meet them, engaging in extremely fierce fighting with the Japanese army between Longkou and Pingshan. The Japanese army launched several attacks, but were all repulsed, leaving behind many corpses. By 3:00 PM, they were completely defeated and fled back to Xin Jie and Longxiang. In this battle, the Chinese army annihilated over 100 Japanese soldiers, seized over 20 rifles, and a large amount of other military supplies. The Chinese army is currently searching and advancing, and the remaining 200 Japanese soldiers near Longkou are heavily besieged.</p>
<p>Japanese Transport Vehicle Ambushed and Blown Up</p>
<p>The Chinese army units active in the suburbs of Guangzhou City have used clever tactics to achieve repeated successes in recent weeks. In the early hours of the 3rd, the Ye unit gathered several hundred men and laid an ambush at Xiaoping in the city suburbs, burying landmines. Around 6:00 AM, a column of Japanese transport vehicles heading north from Huangsha Station reached the location and triggered the landmines, causing the lead vehicle and the front cars to be destroyed, making it impossible to continue. The Chinese army seized the opportunity to launch a surprise attack, causing panic among the Japanese troops who fled in disarray. Subsequently, Japanese troops from the Shijingxi Village came to their aid, but the Chinese army, having accomplished their mission, retreated safely. Later investigations revealed that over a hundred Japanese and puppet soldiers were killed or wounded, countless military supplies were destroyed, and a large number of weapons and ammunition were seized. The Japanese army suffered extremely heavy losses. After this incident, the Japanese army urgently sought to "clean up" the Chinese plainclothes teams along the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, indiscriminately arresting over a hundred civilians in the villages along the line and brutally beating them.</p>
<p>Chinese Army Bravely Assaults Jinhe at Night in Cold Weather</p>
<p>The Japanese army in Conghua has recently increased its troop strength in the Taipingchang area to 1,000 Japanese and puppet soldiers, and is again attempting to make trouble, frequently shelling various locations along the Guangcong Line. The Chinese army has also stepped up its attacks. At midnight on the 4th, amidst the severe cold, they launched a night attack on Jinhe Market. The Japanese army was caught off guard, and the Chinese army charged into the northeastern positions, setting several Japanese camps on fire. The flames quickly spread, aided by the wind, engulfing the area. The Japanese and puppet soldiers were in even greater disarray. The Japanese troops stationed in Taipingchang, upon hearing the news, rushed to their aid, but were intercepted by another unit of the Chinese army, suffering heavy casualties and fleeing in confusion. At 3:00 AM on the 5th, the Chinese army assault units began to retreat on their own initiative.</p>
<h3>Commercial Situation in Hangzhou, Jiaxing and Huzhou: Japanese Army Forcibly Collects Rice</h3>
<p>Jiaxing Correspondence: The puppet county governments of Hangzhou, Yuhang, Haining, Fuyang, and other counties have secretly moved their puppet offices into Japanese military intelligence stations, hoping to gain the protection of the Japanese, due to the extraordinary activity of the mobile units of the Chinese army in the surrounding areas. However, although the puppet organizations have been secretly moved, the Japanese not only do not provide protection, but also use them to cover up Japanese organizations. For example, last winter, when the Chinese army attacked the city of Fuyang, they searched everywhere. When they searched the Japanese intelligence station, the Japanese did not allow the puppet officials to escape, and they escaped through the back door, causing the puppet officials to be arrested and executed. As for the commercial situation in the above-mentioned areas, most of the businesses are small shops. All goods are sold by the Japanese. In addition to paying heavy taxes, English, American, and Chinese goods are sometimes confiscated for various reasons, causing ordinary merchants not to dare to sell them. The rice situation is also very worrying. The Japanese ordered the puppet governments to deliver a certain amount of rice every month, such as 10,000 dan of white rice per month for Hangzhou, 3,000 dan for Yuhang, 3,000 dan for Fuyang, and 5,000 dan for Haining, causing rice prices in various places to rise sharply, averaging over 30 yuan per shi. Puppet officials, large and small, in the puppet governments of Haiyan, Jiaxing, Pinghu, Tongxiang, Chongde, Jiashan, Deqing, Wuxing, and other counties in the Jiahu area are also wary due to the activity of the guerrillas, and are taking leave of absence for various reasons, but the Japanese army does not approve of it, and they can do nothing about it. As for the commercial situation, the Lake area has not made a profit in the past year, because the exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous fees are a heavy burden, the purchasing power of the residents is very weak, and Japanese soldiers often come to forcibly take items. Therefore, many shops have closed this spring. However, the rice industry has made a good profit, with an average profit of 50% for each rice shop. In the Jia area, the most prosperous and profitable business is the opium business, so the number of drug stores is increasing every day this spring.</p>
<h3>Situation of the Kunshan Puppet County Government Collecting Land Tax: Oppressing Farmers and Deceiving Landlords</h3>
<p>Kunshan Correspondence: The puppet county government still collects land tax according to the method of combined collection of rent and tax, which started on November 1st last year. Because it was a year of medium harvest, rice prices were also high, and the puppet police and tax collectors were stepping up their efforts to collect taxes, the farmers dared not resist and paid the taxes. It is said that more than one million yuan has been collected. As for the method, each district has a puppet collection office, and puppet directors are appointed to be in charge of the matter. Those who have land should report the names of the tenant farmers, the location and number of the land, and the amount of rent to be paid to the puppet collection office in the district, so that they can be transferred to the tenant farmers for collection. If anyone conceals and does not report, once it is found out, the land will be confiscated. As for the amount collected from each household, 42% is used as tax and 58% is retained and turned over to the puppet government as rent, which is prepared to be distributed to the landlords. However, in reality, there are often tenant farmers who have already paid the rent, but the puppet collection office claims that they have not paid it, and does not issue it to the landlords. There are countless cases of embezzlement. These people actually regard the embezzled land rent of the landlords as a bonus, which is distributed to the puppet officials at the end of the year, according to the size of their positions. It is said that at the end of the previous year (27th year), the directors of each puppet collection office received bonuses of 4,000 to 5,000 yuan, and at least 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, which shows the magnitude of their encroachment. However, there are as many puppet officials in each puppet collection office as hairs, from the puppet director down to the puppet accountants, collectors, clerks, and even the tax collectors, no less than 50 or 60 people, all of whom are recruited from local scum, so they can do their utmost to "scrape the ground". It is said that their monthly salary ranges from a maximum of 60 yuan to a minimum of 16 yuan. The monthly expenditure of each puppet collection office exceeds one thousand yuan for salaries alone, not including other puppet office expenses. The subsidy for the puppet police is also a considerable amount. The expenses are huge, and all of them are squeezing the blood of the farmers to supply them.</p>
<h3>Suzhou's Rice Shortage: Rice Shops Close One After Another, People in the City Will Run Out of Food</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: Suzhou City's rice supply suddenly became scarce during the Lunar New Year, causing panic among the people in the city. There are more than 40 rice shops of all sizes outside the Loufeng, Xumen, and other city gates. Last year, the rice in stock reached 60,000 to 70,000 shi. Now, the Sanfeng Oil and Rice Shop outside the Gengfeng Gate has closed down. Following them, the Shenji, Zhenlong, Hongxiefeng, and other three shops outside the Lou Gate have also closed down one after another. The Zhaoyuan, Zhenwan, and Yuanchang outside the Geng Gate are also difficult to support. The reason for this is the lack of rice sources. Those who have rice in stock are waiting to see what happens. The Xintai Qia and Qianfenghang in the city, although they have 700 to 800 shi in stock, have now stopped trading. Smaller rice shops are even more difficult to survive. On the second day of the red plate opening, there were very few samples at the Sanwanchang Tea Party. The rice industry said that if there is no way to replenish the rice supply in the future, the people of Suzhou will run out of food.</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Overview of the Implementation of Cooperation Between Construction and Education for Specialized Technology in the Past Year (2)</h3>
<p>There are Five Methods for Introducing Occupations</p>
<p>Job Introduction</p>
<p>The introduction of jobs is not mandatory, and is based purely on the registrant's expertise, aspirations, and expected compensation. There are five methods of introduction: (1) Copy and send the entire resume to various agencies for selection; (2) Introduce the registrant to take training; (3) Designate personnel for various agencies to distribute service groups; (4) Cooperative introduction; (5) Ordinary introduction. The resumes of all qualified registered personnel in each month have been copied and sent to the relevant central authorities for selection. The Ministries of Communications, Economics, Interior, and Military Administration have successively issued orders to their subordinate agencies to select as much as possible, or to consult with the capital city in person to broaden the path of employment. The effectiveness of the cooperation between the construction and education authorities is fully demonstrated here. In addition, if agencies and organizations need technical personnel, or if they hold special training courses to train personnel, the consulting office will select appropriate personnel to introduce after receiving notification or after finding out. For those who have retreated from the war zone and need temporary relief, the consulting office will also request the relevant authorities to register and allocate work, such as asking the Ministry of Education to distribute teachers to serve in social education work groups, and asking the Industrial and Mining Adjustment Office, the Agricultural Bank, and the China Industrial Cooperative Association to register and transfer to job introduction. If the consulting office needs specialized technical personnel and there are no suitable candidates to introduce, it can publicly solicit applications in newspapers, or contact other talent registration agencies or job introduction agencies for cooperative introduction. In addition to the above-mentioned methods, most of the job introductions are entrusted by various parties. The consulting office will give priority to selecting the best candidates from the registered personnel for introduction. It has successively entrusted 9,995 cases of introduction, 258 cases of automatic introduction by the office, and 19 cases of registrants designating work and requesting introduction, for a total of 1,272 cases of introduction. In total, there were 223 job introduction opportunities in the past year, and 744 registered personnel were introduced, among which some were introduced more than once. More than 300 others were unable to be introduced temporarily due to their place of residence. The job introduction is based on the principle of being responsible for both the employer and the job seeker. Therefore, the office requires registered job seekers to go to the office for interviews so that they can be in contact with them, so as to observe their thoughts, character, physical strength, words, and behavior for reference. For the employing agencies, they must clearly understand the conditions, work nature, and compensation of the talents they need as a basis for contact. However, since registered personnel are scattered in various places and cannot be interviewed one by one, it is difficult to have a deep understanding of each registered person. Although a method of entrusting construction and education agencies in various places to conduct interviews on behalf of the office has been established to remedy this, there are still many obstacles in implementation. In addition, registered personnel are mobile and uncertain, or they do not reply after registration, which often leads to repeated contacts, delays time, and rarely achieves success. This is the biggest difficulty in handling job introductions at present. On the part of the hiring agencies, failure to provide detailed information on all the conditions also makes it difficult for contact to proceed. Registered personnel are very strict in their choice of work location. Those in Sichuan do not want to leave Sichuan, and those in other provinces do not want to travel too far. This has its own individual difficulties in fact, but the office's job introduction has been greatly restricted. However, there are many registered personnel in Shanghai and other front-line areas who are eager to transfer to work in the interior. How to find ways to attract them in the future is an urgent problem to be solved. The issue of salary is often a prerequisite for registrants to apply for jobs. The remuneration stipulated in the entrusted cases accepted by the office is often not as desired by the registrants, so that each introduction cannot be guaranteed to be successful. However, technical personnel in science, engineering, agriculture, and technology have been sent to the relevant government authorities for record, and are waiting to be assigned work. Currently, 64 people have been registered, 158 people have been employed through direct introduction by the office, and 218 people have been employed through indirect introduction. In summary, a total of 440 people among the registered personnel have been employed in the past year, accounting for about 40%. This is the general situation of the introduction. The cooperation between construction and education is to adjust talents to meet the needs of the industry, which is only one aspect. In recent years, the calls for unemployment and the lament for the difficulty of finding talents have echoed each other without responding. Now, with the promotion of the Construction and Education Association, which acts as an intermediary, the connection is closely related to the work of resisting Japan. The Ministry of Education has always taken the lead in solving the employment of this year's university graduates. This year, there are more than 5,300 graduates from universities and colleges across the country. More than half of them have obtained service opportunities through the Ministry of Education's overall planning. In addition, all graduates of vocational schools at all levels this year have been properly placed. Graduates of all levels of schools in the past have been registered and introduced by the association. In addition, the relief of unemployed workers in transportation, industry, mining, agriculture, forestry, and other technologies has been transferred to the construction of the rear by the competent authorities. The number is more than 50,000. This is the general situation of the government's use of unemployed technical personnel since the Anti-Japanese War (End).</p>

<h3>Saigon Interport Football Team: Three Defeats in Three Games in Hong Kong, Third Game Lost to Eastern Association</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) The Saigon Interport Football Team lost to the Hong Kong Interport Team in Hong Kong, and then lost to South China. Yesterday (12th) against Eastern, they lost badly with a score of one to five. Hou Chengtong of the Eastern Association broke the first barrier, and Zhang Jinhai scored four goals, which was considered a revenge for the shame of losing one to nine in Vietnam. However, after losing the first goal, the Saigon team's actions gradually became rough, making people wonder whether South China and Eastern's defeat in Vietnam was due to technical defeat or the victory of violence. The battle process is as follows:</p>
<p>First Goal</p>
<p>On this day, the Vietnamese team used all their new strength, and the lineup changed greatly from before. Eastern was determined to win. They took the attack first. At 28 minutes, Zhong Yongsen carried the ball through two Vietnamese passes and shot low. Hou Chengtong was quick and decisive, and took the lead with a fierce attack. Eastern opened the scoring with a score of 1-0.</p>
<p>Second Goal</p>
<p>At 31 minutes, Zhang Jinhai got the ball in the middle and launched a cold arrow from more than 20 yards away. At this time, the Saigon team was in a state of confusion, and Awei had no way to respond. The ball went straight into the upper left corner, 2-0.</p>
<p>Third Goal</p>
<p>Five minutes after the change of sides, Hou Chengtong made a wonderful pass. Zhang Jinhai rushed in like a surprise attack and scored with a frontal blow, 3-0. At 10 minutes, Jinhai collided with Pani Xian, the captain of the Saigon team. Pa immediately used his fist to attack Jinhai. The referee persuaded them to stop.</p>
<p>Fourth Goal</p>
<p>After 20 minutes, Eastern adopted a defensive posture. Wu Qixiang's interception of Guiren was ineffective, and he was penetrated. Ruan Wenhong shot directly into the net, Saigon recovered a city, 1-3.</p>
<p>Fifth Goal</p>
<p>At 20 minutes, Gorya attacked Hou Chengtong and tried to intercept him horizontally. Hou fired a bullet from the border. The ball hit the goal post and bounced out. Zhang Jinhai, an ambush soldier, rose up suddenly, 4-1.</p>
<p>Sixth Goal</p>
<p>At 33 minutes, Hou Chengtong made a comeback. He made a wonderful pass in front of the goal, and Zhang Jinhai's head blossomed again, 5-1. After that, although Saigon made progress, they could not reverse the defeat. Eastern finally won with a score of 5-1.</p>
<p>Battle with Chinese League</p>
<p>The Saigon team was originally scheduled to return to Vietnam on the 13th. In response to Macau's request, they extended their trip by one week. They have now gone to Macau on the 14th. It is planned that when they pass through Hong Kong, they will have another duel with the Hong Kong Chinese League team. The date has been set (18th), and the location is Jiaoluyun Mountain.

<p>The issue of police affairs on the extra-settlement roads in western Shanghai, after half a year of back-and-forth negotiations between Frank Craven, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, and Fessenden, Secretary-General, with the "Municipal Government," was formally signed by both parties yesterday (16th) at 6:00 PM. The Concession authorities, recognizing the past undesirable conditions in the extra-settlement areas and the actual necessity for improvement, were thus motivated to seek a joint solution. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Full Text of the Agreement: (1) After consultation between the Shanghai "Special Municipality Government" and the Shanghai Municipal Council, it is decided to establish a special police force in the Shanghai western extra-mural road area, and to establish an appropriate number of police stations and police substations in this area.

During this interim agreement, they shall be the only agency authorized to exercise police powers in the area.</p>
<p>(2) The number of personnel and the structure of the special police force shall be determined by the "Director of the Shanghai Special Municipality Police Bureau" in consultation with the Chief of Police of the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>

<p>"Note": This interim agreement is prepared in both Chinese and English, but the interpretation and translation of all articles shall be based on the Chinese text.</p>
<p>Japanese Consul's Statement</p>
<p>Shanghai, 16th (Domei News Agency): The Shanghai "Special Municipality Government" and the Public Concession Shanghai Municipal Council today signed a temporary agreement on extra-settlement road construction in western Shanghai. The authorities of the Japanese Consulate-General in Shanghai also issued a statement expressing their pleasure at this development. At the same time, they stated that Japan is prepared to resolve the issue of the Shanghai Municipal Council police returning to the area north of the Suzhou Creek, which is particularly noteworthy. The content of the statement is as follows: The issue of police power in the extra-settlement road construction area in western Shanghai has been negotiated by the "Special Municipality Government" and the Public Concession Shanghai Municipal Council since last year. Today, an agreement has been reached on fundamental principles, deciding to establish a special police district under the Shanghai "Municipal Government" in the area. The two authorities will continue to negotiate the detailed conditions for implementing this agreement in the coming days. Japan is particularly concerned about the security situation in the area, and is very pleased that this agreement has been reached. Furthermore, Japan has been negotiating with the Public Concession Shanghai Municipal Council since last year to discuss the issue of the Shanghai Municipal Council police returning to the area north of the Suzhou Creek, in order to restore Shanghai to its original state after being in an abnormal state since 1937. An outline was agreed upon with the Shanghai Municipal Council last August, but its implementation had to be temporarily suspended due to the misconduct of Shanghai Municipal Council police officers in western Shanghai. Now that this agreement has been reached, the situation in the western Shanghai area will become clearer. Therefore, Japan is prepared to sign the agreement reached last year with the Shanghai Municipal Council as soon as possible, and to begin negotiating the necessary details for its implementation. This is hereby declared.</p>
<p>Details to be Discussed</p>
<p>According to further investigations by our reporter, this agreement will take effect immediately after it is signed. As for the number of police forces in the area, the locations of the police stations, the heads of the stations, and other senior officials, these issues will be discussed and decided by both parties in the near future. Cases involving foreigners will be handled solely by foreign police officers. The date for the establishment of police stations in the large extra-settlement road construction area is gradually approaching.</p>
<p>Temporary Error</p>
<p>The signing of the temporary agreement on police affairs for the extra-settlement roads was originally scheduled for 4:45 PM yesterday. Therefore, Frank Craven, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Secretary-General Fessenden had arrived promptly. Japanese Consul-General Miura also arrived at 3:50 PM. The agreement was prepared in both Chinese and English. Unexpectedly, just as the signing was about to begin, it was discovered that there were numerous errors in the English typescript of the agreement. Therefore, the staff, in a state of embarrassment, had to revise the English version. It was not until after 5:00 PM that the task was completed. Finally, the two signatories of the agreement, Craven and Fessenden, and Chuan Xiaonan, completed their mission at 6:00 PM. It is understood that the legal advisor Mr. Bolam also accompanied Craven and Fessenden yesterday, while Su Xiwun and others from Chuan's side also participated.</p>
<p>No Tax Involvement</p>
<p>Although the police affairs part of the agreement on extra-settlement roads has been temporarily concluded after the signing, the issue of foreign taxation remains completely unresolved. According to statements made by a Japanese spokesman in the press briefing last night, there is currently no decision on the issue of extra-settlement taxes.</p>
<p>Funding Issues</p>
<p>When a foreign journalist asked the Japanese spokesman whether the Japanese army would allow the special police to exercise their duties outside the extra-settlement roads, the spokesman replied, "As there have been no disputes in these areas to date, there seems to be no problem with the Japanese army being stationed there." Beyond that, he knew nothing. The spokesman also said that he had no idea who would pay for the maintenance of the police. It was also stated at the meeting that the agreement had been distributed to the consulates in Shanghai for review.</p>
<h3>Christian Endeavor Society to Hold Revival Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Christian Endeavor Society will hold a joint revival meeting with various churches in Shanghai from the 18th to the 24th. Special topics will be edited. Except for the Xieqiao Sabbath Church, which will hold meetings at 3:00 PM every afternoon, sermons will be given every evening at 7:30 PM. All are welcome to attend.

<h3>Citizens' Associations in Various Districts Urge Expansion of Rice Price Stabilization; Rice Price Stabilization Decided to Continue from the 23rd; One Yuan Per Person Changed to Sell Five and a Half Jin</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, the Citizens' Associations of the 18th, 27th, 15th, 36th, 37th, and other districts, in order to urge the Rice Price Stabilization Association to expand the scope of rice price stabilization, specially informs all circles, please generously donate to the rice price stabilization fund to benefit the poor. Their announcement to all circles says, the skyrocketing of Shanghai's commodity prices poses a serious threat to middle- and lower-class citizens, especially in terms of food rice. Because other things can be saved, or may not be used, but rice cannot be lacking for a day. So there is an ancient saying, called "The people regard food as heaven." This situation, of course, cannot be allowed to continue. Therefore, first there was the joint announcement by the Concession authorities, strictly setting price limits and prohibiting hoarding and manipulation. Then various circles organized the Shanghai People's Food Regulation Association to handle the ordering of foreign rice and the matter of rice price stabilization. After the start of the market after the Spring Festival, rice prices suddenly rose sharply again. Alas, we, the common people, will have no way to survive. As an emergency measure, we can only urge the Rice Price Stabilization Committee to expand the scope of rice price stabilization to provide temporary relief. However, the losses from rice price stabilization depend on funds to be raised, so we hope that those who have the ability will generously donate, so that rice price stabilization can complete its greatest mission, which will not only benefit the poor but also benefit society and bring peace.</p>
<p>Second Phase of Rice Price Stabilization to Begin on the 23rd</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Price Stabilization Committee held its fifth standing committee meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday. Chairman Yu Qiaqing reported that donations received up to February 15th amounted to 567,459.43 yuan. Matters discussed: It was decided that from February 23rd, the members of the Rice Merchants Association will continue to be entrusted to handle rice sales, with a limit of one yuan per person, and each yuan will be changed to five and a half jin. Because the current rice price is increasing, calculated at five and a half jin per yuan, each shi (unit of dry measure) will lose more than seven yuan. According to this selling price, each shi will only sell for twenty-nine yuan, while the purchase cost must be more than thirty-six yuan. If calculated according to the current market price (forty yuan and eight jiao), the loss will reach ten yuan and some jiao.</p>
<p>Charitable Organizations Continue Relief Efforts</p>
<p>The Shanghai Buddhist Benevolent Association's ticket distribution and porridge distribution have been well-received by the public since their implementation. The association held a board meeting yesterday and decided to print another 10,000 porridge tickets to benefit the poor.</p>
<h3>Coal Merchants Refuse to Sell; Manipulation is Extremely Obvious; However, Current Coal Briquette Reserves are Very Substantial; Wealthy Households Should Not Buy Excessively to Avoid Stimulating Market Prices</h3>
<p>The recent surge in coal briquette prices has deeply affected the citizens. In fact, Shanghai's current coal briquette reserves are very substantial and sufficient to meet the needs of the citizens. Do not be afraid that there will be a shortage, and instead be exploited by unscrupulous merchants. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, and other public organizations, as well as major coal merchants, have recently consulted to regulate the supply, so that the selling price of coal briquettes in Shanghai can be stabilized as soon as possible. The public organizations firmly believe that, given the current coal briquette reserves and production volume, if proper regulation can be achieved in terms of supply and demand, the price of coal briquettes will soon fall. It is hoped that citizens from all walks of life will remain calm and not purchase and store excessively, which would stimulate market prices. Public organizations and coal merchants will continue to meet in the coming days to stabilize coal briquette prices in the short term.</p>
<p>Available But Not Sold</p>
<p>The prices of goods in this port have been soaring, and the threat to the lives of citizens is increasing, especially the two items of rice and coal, which are necessary for life, and the speed of their increase is even more shocking. According to investigations by reporters from the Datong News Agency, most coal briquette stores refuse to sell coal briquettes, creating a situation where they are available but not sold, with the intention of hoarding and speculating. This is obvious. Customers must purchase coal with old receipts before they will sell it to them, and new households are also refused sales. The price of coal briquettes before the war was only about nine jiao per dan (unit of weight), and the price last month was only more than three yuan. In recent weeks, it has suddenly soared, and it is very obvious that it is being manipulated. Because the market price fluctuates so quickly, the selling prices of various coal briquette merchants are quite inconsistent, and most coal briquette manufacturers follow the lead of a few manufacturers who manipulate the market price. If the authorities do not quickly suppress this, the threat to the lives of Shanghai residents will be endless and will increase day by day.</p>
<p>Authorities Investigate</p>
<p>More than 500 hot water shops in the two concessions have been severely affected by the high coal prices and have suspended business one after another. Although the industry association has held several meetings to come up with proper solutions and appealed for assistance, they have not been fully resolved even for half a month. Because the closure of hot water shops is of great importance to the entire livelihood of the people, and it is extremely inconvenient for various organizations, groups, schools, and households, the Concession authorities are paying close attention to the closure of hot water shops. Yesterday, they sent personnel to the hot water industry to investigate the reasons for the closure of hot water shops, and it is rumored that they will find ways to lower coal prices.</p>
<h3>Post-War Rubber Industry in Severe Decline</h3>
<p>I recently met with someone from the rubber industry association, who said that the decline of the rubber industry this year is far beyond what outsiders can easily imagine and know. The rubber products industry in this port was at its peak in 1926 and 1927. After 1931, it gradually declined due to the January 28th Incident, partly due to post-war financial contraction and partly due to the weakness of the people's purchasing power.</p>
<p>Obstructed Access</p>
<p>It was not until one year before August 13th that there was a turning point. Unexpectedly, the August 13th Incident occurred again, and most of the factories of the industry were destroyed by artillery fire. In recent years, those who have been able to relocate to safe areas and resume operations are less than 30% of the original. Currently, including factories that have not been affected by the war, there are only a dozen or so. In the current situation, raw materials and labor costs, and the prices of all goods have skyrocketed.</p>
<p>After the clothes are made, transportation is inconvenient, and sales are almost impossible. The factories are able to barely work, and they are only maintaining the livelihoods of their workers. However, there are also those who cannot continue to work hard. For example, Wuhua Rubber Factory has a history of several years, and because it cannot be maintained, it has changed its brand and owner. Also, factories such as Jiaotong Yisheng are also</p>
<p>Operating intermittently</p>
<p>There is very little vigorous atmosphere. The rubber department of Yonghe Industrial Company has not recovered since the January 28th battle due to a lack of development opportunities. There is also Zhengchun Factory, which has found a new location on Wuding Road because the old factory's transportation is inconvenient, and has been preparing for a while. It is now actively producing, but the various costs have increased sharply, and transportation and sales are not easy. If production increases, not only will there be no profit, but there will also be losses, because if the selling price is too high, no one will care. If it is lowered, it will not be cost-effective, so there is a dilemma. Therefore, this year's rubber industry can be called the end of the road.</p>
<h3>Romanian Minister to Japan Returns to Japan from Shanghai after a Leisure Trip</h3>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that the Romanian Minister to Japan, Mr. Bălăceanu-Stolnici, has been visiting Shanghai for several weeks and left Shanghai for Tokyo today (the 16th) aboard the President Cleveland.</p>
<h3>British Consul Gitson on Extended Leave</h3>
<p>Leaves Shanghai on Sunday; To Visit Chuan Xiaonan</p>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that the British Consul-General in Shanghai, George, accompanied by British Consul Gitson, paid an informal visit to "Mayor" Chuan Xiaonan in the city center yesterday (the 15th). Gitson was saying goodbye to Mr. Chuan, as Mr. Gitson will be leaving Shanghai on Sunday noon for an extended leave.</p>
<h3>Italian Ship Passes Through Shanghai; Steel Transported to Japan</h3>
<p>Japanese Army Heavily Buys in Europe</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army invaded China, the consumption and losses of materials have been very large. Therefore, in the occupied areas, it has been collecting as much steel, iron, copper, tin, lead, and other metals as possible to transport back to Japan to rush to make weapons of aggression. However, what has been scraped together is still not enough. Therefore, it has been heavily buying in various European countries. In the past, steel was directly transported to Japan, and the amount of steel that was transported to Japan via Shanghai was uncountable. Recently, an Italian ship has loaded old steel of 1,040 tons and new steel of 128 tons, totaling 1,168 tons. The goods from the ship in Shanghai have already been unloaded. It is scheduled to depart today and transport the steel to Japan for delivery.</p>
<h3>YMCA Organizes Deaf and Dumb Society</h3>
<p>The Deaf and Dumb Society organized by the Shanghai Chinese Christian Association will hold its inaugural meeting at 2:30 PM today (the 17th) in the East Hall on the ninth floor of the association at Eight Immortals Bridge. The program includes a chairman's report, speeches, election of officers, a dinner, a photo session, entertainment, etc. It is reported that more than 100 people have registered to attend.</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspaper Advertises That a New Police District Will Be Established in Hongkou; Chinese Still Face the Danger of Arrest When Entering the Open Area; Those Landing in Pudong Must Undergo Severe Inspection</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the Japanese-language Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun stated yesterday morning (the 15th) that, regarding the relaxation of the Hongkou pass restrictions and the increase in the number of Japanese staff in the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, it is expected that the Police Department will soon establish a new "Eastern District" and have a Japanese person in charge of the district. It is expected that after Shanghai Municipal Council Secretary-General and Chairman Fessenden returns to Shanghai and the Shanghai Municipal Council and the "Shanghai Municipal Government" sign the West District extra-settlement road agreement, the plan to establish a new police district will be realized.</p>
<p>After Hongkou, Zhabei, and Yangshupu were opened the day before yesterday, yesterday was the second day. The Wuzhen Road Bridge to Zhabei is being repaired and cannot be used. Therefore, everyone is going around the Sichuan Road Bridge. After crossing the bridge, the houses on both sides of the city are all occupied, with either military institutions or various companies, shops, and stores.</p>
<p>According to reports, the South City's situation is that the Japanese side's opening of a part of the Shanghai suburbs this time has special significance. In addition to the naval garrison area, which was implemented yesterday, the bustling urban area north of the Jingjieqian in the South City, although it belongs to the defense army garrison area, is said to be opened from the first day of next month. Citizens can pass without a pass. On the one hand, it will facilitate the transportation of grain from the Shanghai suburbs, which is the main food for civilians, and lower the price (at present, the price of rice in the Shanghai suburbs is up to 37 or 38 yuan per shi for domestic rice, which is more than 10 yuan different from the Concession), so that civilians in the Concession who are under the pressure of life will move to the Shanghai suburbs.</p>
<p>The meaning of opening up is to fulfill its ambition of "prosperity of the market." The puppet "Municipal Government" is inducing people to go to Shanghai suburbs to increase its income from miscellaneous "taxes" because its income from "taxes" is not much and it faces an economic panic. However, because the people feel that they have no legal protection on their bodies as soon as they leave the isolated island and they are in danger of being arrested at any time, the puppet "Government's" dream is still a disappointment. As for the area where the Fourth Detachment of the Japanese Navy is stationed in Pudong, the so-called "citizen card" of the "Police Bureau" was revoked from the 15th (the day before yesterday), and there are no restrictions on civilians walking in the open area.</p>
<p>Then the Pudong area is very narrow, as far as Zhangjiahong to the south, Yangjing Port to the east, and Putan to the west and north. The area is six Chinese miles in diameter from north to south, and nine Chinese miles in diameter from east to west, for a total of 54 Chinese square miles. Zhangjiahong faces inward to the east of Yangjing Port, and it is the Japanese Army garrison area. The river embankment is the natural boundary. Without a "citizen card," it is still not allowed to pass the river. Also, although it is called an opening, when disembarking from the ferry from the Concession to Pudong, they are still under the surveillance of the Japanese Navy at each dock and are subject to strict searches by the "unarmed police." Those who are regarded as suspicious are still subject to arrest, which is no different from when it was not open. From Yangjiadu Pier in Pudong, taking a ferry to the South City also requires carrying a "citizen card," otherwise there is a risk of being detained.</p>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that at 8:00 PM yesterday (the 15th), a foreigner was in the back seat of a small electric company truck and was stopped by a Japanese Army sentry near the Huishan district. The Japanese sentry spoke to the foreigner in English, stating, "The car you are riding in is driving a little too fast. If it were three months ago, we would have thrown you into the river. But today, for the sake of friendship, we are only giving you a gentle warning." The sentry then issued the same warning to the truck driver in Chinese.</p>
<h3>Hanwa Steamer Near Fushan Nearly Hijacked by Pirates; Two Pirates Boarded the Ship, One Killed and One Captured; The Ship Immediately Returned to Port, Both Pirates Brought to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since the August 13th Incident, the Yangtze River steamers of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. and Butterfield &amp; Swire have stopped sailing and instead sail to downstream ports (Taizhou), Xingang (Jingjiang), Yaogang, and Tianshenggang (Tongzhou). Business is still not bad. After the Chinese army withdrew to the west, the Yangtze River was controlled by the Japanese army, and foreign merchants were viewed with jealousy. Therefore, Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson changed the river steamers to sail north, and only the Wulin and Tonghe steamers are sailing, but after March of last year, they were unable to transport safely and were often obstructed. The various situations have been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. Recently,</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson sent another Hanwa steamer, towing two barges No. 23 and No. 24, to various ports on the Upper River, intending to solicit cargo. Unexpectedly, at 7:00 AM yesterday (the 16th), when it arrived near Fushan, a county under the jurisdiction of Changshu above Hupu, it was nearly hijacked by pirates. At the time, there was a wooden barge with two pirates. The two pirates jumped on the Hanwa steamer, holding guns. A Russian bodyguard happened to see them, and the pirate immediately asked</p>
<p>Where is the comprador? Although the Russian was wearing a gun, he saw that the pirate was holding a gun and did not want to draw it. He thought of a plan and replied that the comprador was in the lower cabin. Then he turned and went to the upper deck. When the two pirates saw the Russian fleeing, they immediately fired a gun but did not hit anyone. However, a Russian bodyguard on the upper deck saw the two pirates firing a gun, thinking they were bandits, and immediately drew his gun and fired three shots. One pirate was shot and killed on the spot. Another pirate was monitored by another Russian bodyguard in the lower cabin. The pirate was controlled</p>
<p>Unable to escape, he shouted for help. Unexpectedly, there was another barge with six or seven pirates rushing to help. The two Russians saw it and immediately opened fire to stop it. The pirate ship then escaped. The arms of the pirate on the Hanwa steamer were politely taken away by the comprador. The owner of the Hanwa steamer then ordered the ship to turn around and bring the two iron barges back to Shanghai. The two pirates, one dead and one captured, were brought to Shanghai. The ship entered port at 5:00 PM yesterday and docked at the Garden Pier. The two pirates, one dead and one alive, were taken to the Xinguang Pier by boat and handed over to the Customs Port Police Station (i.e., the Water Patrol Station) for disposal. There were two gold rings on the finger of the dead pirate.</p>
<p>According to foreign news, the Hanwa steamer of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. encountered pirates near Fushan on the Yangtze River yesterday morning. It was then intercepted by the Russian guards of the ship, and the two sides fought for two or three hours. One pirate was shot and killed on the spot, and one was captured alive. There were no deaths or injuries among the Russian guards. At that time, the pirates had once climbed the ship, but were eventually driven away. This is the first time in months that a British ship has encountered pirates.</p>

<h3>Personnel of the Puppet "Workers' Welfare Association" Rely on Strength to Assault and Injure Foreman; Shen Rongsheng Sentenced to Two Months of Imprisonment</h3>
<p>The workers of the Dazhang Paper Mill at No. 408 Yangshupu Road recently went on strike because they demanded that the factory improve their treatment and increase their wages, but they were not successful. The "Chinese Workers' Welfare Association" at No. 127 Longjiang Road drafted 15 conditions for the labor side. At the same time, the "Association" sent representative Gao Boxi</p>
<p>To mediate. However, Zhang A'er, a native of Jiangbei, who lived in Dingheli, Yangshupu Road, and had been serving as a foreman in the Tianzhang Paper Mill, expressed strong dissatisfaction with the strike and strongly opposed the strike and refused to join the "Welfare Association." The "Welfare Association" found out about this, so at 6:00 PM the day before yesterday, it sent representatives Shen Rongsheng (a native of Changzhou), Yu Zhengyi, Li Qisheng, Chen Agui, Zhu Shier, and five others to Zhang's home, and</p>
<p>By violent means, they kidnapped Zhang to the "Association" and illegally detained him, and beat him. They also wanted to send him to the Japanese Command. When the Tianzhang Paper Mill heard about this, it reported to the Yulin Road Patrol Room, which sent detectives Wu Jiwen and Western detective Luo Si to rescue Zhang. They arrested Shen Rongsheng on the spot and took him to the Patrol Room, ordering Zhang to be sent to the Hudong Hospital, where it was verified that he had a chest injury. Yesterday morning, Shen Rongsheng was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Patrol Room lawyer Zhang Quan'yin</p>
<p>Filed a lawsuit in accordance with the law and stated the circumstances. Zhang A'er also filed a complaint about being illegally detained and beaten. In response to Shen Rongsheng's questioning, his confession was evasive. Judge Xiao Peishen reviewed the confession and sentenced Shen Rongsheng to two months of imprisonment for using violent coercion to force others to do what they are not obliged to do. If he opts for a fine in lieu of imprisonment, it will be calculated at one yuan per day.</p>

<h3>Under Speculation and Manipulation, the Gold Market Remains Chaotic - Bullish Forces are Emerging, the Upward Trend Has Been Thwarted</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash Shanghai gold dark market situation was unusually bewildering, with buyers following the trend, causing prices to rise and fall rapidly and unpredictably from morning to night, with a difference of 157 yuan. However, the final result showed a drop on paper, but in reality, it was just even. Initially, gold dealers were the first to buy, pushing up the price by 15 yuan, but the money changers vigorously sold, causing it to fall back immediately. Subsequently, a certain money changer bought on behalf of a Hong Kong group, and with the foreign exchange rate quite tight, plus bullish speculators taking advantage of the momentum to aggressively push up the price, it soared to an unprecedented new high of 4915 yuan. However, the good times did not last long. The foreign exchange rate suddenly reported a rebound, and gold dealers sold en masse, with retail investors rushing to sell, causing a setback of 4825 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the foreign exchange market strengthening further, the setback widened, and the price once fell to a low of 4758 yuan. Later, the foreign exchange rate remained tight, and securities firms switched from selling to buying, coupled with gold dealers and others entering again, so by the evening close, it had risen again by 4838 yuan. As a result, it closed 27 yuan lower than the previous day, but after the close, buying interest surged, pushing it up again to 4880 yuan. Later, a certain money changer sold, and the final price was 4860 yuan. The entire day's trading was extremely active, with 3300 to 3400 taels traded. Gold jewelry once reached a new high price of 495 yuan, but eventually returned to even. Customs gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The New Shanghai Gold Price is Constantly Emerging</p>

Shortly after, a certain money changer vigorously sold over 200 taels, instantly pushing the price down by 25 yuan. A certain money changer sold 30 taels to gold dealers for 4855 yuan. Subsequently, the foreign exchange rate tightened suddenly, sellers decreased, and securities firms and another money changer aggressively pushed up the price, breaking through the 4900 yuan barrier. Securities firms bought 20 taels from money changers for 4915 yuan. Subsequently, due to the foreign exchange rate strengthening, selling pressure intensified, with jewelry dealers, gold dealers, and retail investors tending to sell. Soon, it plummeted by 90 yuan. Jewelry dealers traded 20 taels among themselves, falling to 4825 yuan. Later, a certain securities firm aggressively bought at the low price, and retail investors returned to buy again, coupled with a certain money changer also scooping up a significant amount, causing it to rebound by 70 yuan. Gold dealers traded 50 taels among themselves for 4895 yuan. At noon, another bullish securities firm emerged, and jewelry dealers and money changers also sold, causing it to fall again by 65 yuan.

Jewelry dealers sold 10 taels to money changers for 4758 yuan.

Securities firms bought 50 taels from gold dealers for 4838 yuan, as the closing price. As a result, it fell by 27 yuan compared to the previous day. After the close, gold dealers and securities firms' intentions remained strong, with mutual bidding and aggressive purchases, and a certain firm also followed suit and scooped up a significant amount, causing it to soar again by 42 yuan. A certain gold dealer bought a total of 60 taels from jewelry dealers and retail investors for 4880 yuan. Later, a certain money changer suddenly sold, causing it to fall back by 20 yuan. The final price was 4860 yuan, with a fluctuation of 157 yuan throughout the day.

<h3>Speculators Take Profits and Sell, British and American Exchange Rates Gradually Stabilize</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: The HSBC listed exchange rates decreased. The British exchange rate decreased by 0.125, totaling 4 pence. The American exchange rate decreased by 0.1875, totaling 6.5625 yuan. The remaining rates also decreased in unison. The British and American exchange rate dark market initially seemed bullish, but then turned stable. Initially, due to the large volume of payments for foreign firm's cotton and wheat, and HSBC reversing to buy, although speculators such as Sassoon and general bullish speculators took the opportunity to take profits and sell, the funds were still insufficient. By 9:20, the price had tightened to 4.125 pence and 6.75 yuan, the tightest prices this year. As the number of buyers gradually decreased, coupled with speculators continuing to sell, the market gradually returned to even. By the noon close, it was 4.7875 pence and 6.84375 yuan. The early afternoon was very calm, but later, with Hong Kong telegrams slightly disrupted and Chinese merchants selling again, the market hardened to 4.203125 pence and 6.9375 yuan. Later, due to foreign firms from Britain and the United States having a good appetite for purchases, by the evening close, it was only reported at 4.15625 pence and 6.84375 yuan. As a result, it was 0.03125 more bullish than the previous day. The potential of futures remained no different from spot prices.</p>
<p>HSBC Listed Exchange Rates Decreased Again</p>
<p>Initially in the morning, the London long-term rate decreased by approximately 0.0615, the long-term rate remained flat, the New York silver price remained flat, and London raw gold remained unchanged. The exchange rate of British currency to American currency and to French currency were both flat. The exchange rate to Shanghai decreased by 0.0625. The exchange rate of American currency to British currency fell by half a cent, the exchange rate to Shanghai decreased by 0.15 yuan, and the exchange rate to French currency decreased by a small amount of 0.025. The central listed exchange rates remained the same. The opening selling prices of spot goods in the bank in the morning were 4.1875 pence for British currency and 6.875 yuan for American currency, with no gain or loss compared to the previous close. After the opening, foreign firms' cotton and wheat payments remained strong, and HSBC reversed to buy, although profit-taking speculators such as Sassoon and Chinese merchants took the opportunity to sell in large quantities, funds were still difficult to balance, causing the market to suddenly tighten. It was estimated that the foreign firms settled the purchase of American currency in March at 6.71875 yuan. At the same time, Sassoon sold British currency in February at 4.1875 pence to foreign firms, and Chinese merchants sold American currency in the current month at 6.875 and 6.84375 yuan to foreign firms at a profit. Afterwards, HSBC would buy the American currency of its peers in the current month at the tightest price of 6.75 yuan. At 9:20, the spot price had also softened to 4.125 pence and 6.75 yuan. The HSBC listed rates were announced, with British currency decreasing by 0.125 and American currency decreasing by a small amount of 0.1875. The white silver balance tax was announced to fall by 0.025. Afterwards, the foreign firms' appetite for purchases had been satiated, and HSBC's intention to buy turned weak, while the bullish Chinese merchants continued to close positions, so the funds suddenly felt oversupplied, and the market gradually rebounded. It was estimated that Chinese merchants settled the sale of American currency in the current month at 6.8125 yuan and American currency in March at 6.75 yuan to a certain bank. At that time, the spot price of British currency had reported 4.1875 pence, and the American currency had also reached 6.875 yuan. At noon, the buying and selling were even, and the situation was particularly flat. By the close, British currency was 4.171875 pence and American currency was 6.84375 yuan, slightly tighter by 0.015625 and 0.03125 compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>The Result is Still Slightly Tighter Than Before</p>
<p>The market was initially quite stagnant. Around 3:00, due to telegrams from Hong Kong arriving with sales, and speculators continuing to sell, although foreign firms still had an appetite for purchases, they all took advantage of the momentum to raise prices, so it hardened slightly. It was estimated that speculators sold American currency in the current month to foreign firms at 6.90625 yuan, and Hong Kong telegrams sold spot British currency at 4.1875 pence to the Macaulay firm. The tightest price had called for 4.103125 pence and 6.9375 yuan. As the selling gradually subsided, and foreign firms still had an appetite for purchases, the situation turned soft, and by the evening close, British currency was 4.5625 pence, and American currency was 6.84375 yuan. The current month was the same as the above price, the next month's futures were 4.09375 pence for British currency and 6.71875 yuan for American currency. As a result, the spot and American currency were each 0.03125 tighter than the previous day.</p>

The "Joint Notes" dark market was cheaper by 2 yuan, to 108 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities, Domestic Debt Transactions are Slightly Dull, Foreign Stocks are Rising</h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities dark market situation: The trend went from weak to firm, and transactions gradually became sluggish. Most major players were standing still, and retail investors were slightly covering positions. People were feeling slack, and buying and selling were not enthusiastic. After the red market's goods and materials soared, speculators abandoned this and turned to other things. The government bond market then turned dull again. It is currently waiting for the formal establishment of the Sino-American loan, which should bring a surge of activity. Yesterday morning's half-day trading was only over 300,000 yuan, and most of it was internal trading, accounting for the majority. There were only a small number of customer transactions. Type A had broken through 7 yuan, and Type C had retreated into 47 yuan, then came back out again, slowly becoming firmer. As a result, Type A was up a maximum of 4.5 jiao, with the rest up from a small amount to 3.5 jiao. The market closed at noon. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Transactions: 100 shares of the Great China Match Company were traded at a price of 22 yuan.</p>
<p>The Public Industry Association stock market remained extremely firm and active, with the turnover being large. Some stocks have even reached new highs. Due to the tight market prices, there is also strong interest in leather stocks. The shares of industries surged dramatically, with Jardine Matheson, Wheelock, and International Trust among the leaders.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton, Cotton Yarn Jumps Wildly, Also Sets a New Record</h3>
<p>The Futures Market Once Opened at 890 Yuan</p>
<p>Causing a Massive Sell-Off in the Market for Profit Taking</p>
<p>The yarn market opened with a jump, discovering a new record in the history of the yarn industry. The price of 20-count Shuangma yarn for February reached 890 yuan, an increase of 30 yuan compared to the previous year's peak price of 860 yuan. As soon as this price opened, general profit-takers seized the opportunity to close their positions one after another, and the market quickly declined again. Daily sales remained sluggish and unremarkable. Although people were unusually enthusiastic, those who were dragging in goods were still unwilling to give up. According to the market situation, it rises and falls from time to time, and it is extremely chaotic.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened in the morning, because the price of gold had soared in the afternoon of the previous day, people's hearts were agitated, and buying sentiment was strong. The opening price of 20-count Shuangma yarn for the current month immediately reached 890 yuan, and the spot price was 880 yuan. Then, as profit-takers in the same industry closed their positions according to the market, the market suddenly loosened and fell straight to 850 yuan. Part of it then came back to pull in, and it rose again, and when it reached the close, because the amount of selling by the bulls was even greater, it still returned to almost flat weakness, but after closing and consolidation, it was seen to rise again. It was found that the trading statistics for half a day were 3,275 bales, and the market price of 20-count Shuangma yarn rose by 6 yuan. The amount bought by each gang is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Same Industry: 3,190 Hong Kong: 45</p>
<p>Inland: 20 Ningbo: 20</p>
<p>Total: 3,275</p>
<h3>Cotton Prices Have Reached a Peak, Transactions are Also Becoming Slack</h3>
<p>The trading of this cotton is less, and people's hearts are still firm. People in the same industry have better ideas. This is because the sources of supply from various places are declining, and the local inventory is becoming increasingly thin, so those who hold the goods will not sell them unless at a high price. In addition, the yarn market is rising, and factories are about to take action, but there is still a shortage of supply. The amount bought by each gang is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Another Message Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was initially firmer this morning, but later, due to public selling, the market turned weak. As a result, closing prices fell by two pounds compared to the previous day. India, including forecasts, rose by more than one rupee, Egypt rose by more than ten pounds, and Liverpool was closed.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the exchange rate in the Shanghai foreign cotton transaction had fallen to a low price, and all parties had already considered the price of raw cotton to have reached its peak, so purchases had turned slightly sluggish, and transactions were not as lively as in previous days. With the current cotton prices, factories have calculated that the cost of cotton yarn is much more expensive than the market price of yarn, so they are unwilling to search for cotton, or to open cotton yarn. Therefore, factory transactions are abnormally quiet. The following is the price of the cotton market yesterday, converted into the factory price with an American exchange rate of 6.875 yuan.</p>

<h3>Uneven Nutrition</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiayin</p>
<p>The lack of talent and the large number of unemployed people are a major loophole in the current society. This contradictory phenomenon is not only worthy of attention, but also a rather serious social pathology.</p>
<p>The American magazine "American Magazine" recently solicited the opinions of 300 of the most famous industrial and commercial leaders in the country, asking them whether the industrial and commercial circles currently need people, and what kind of talent is needed. The answers obtained were almost completely consistent. They all believe that the industrial and commercial sectors are in urgent need of people, and what is needed is specialized technical talent who can humbly learn and are willing to work hard. According to statistics, the United States needed about 2 million talents in 1940.</p>
<p>The alarming fact is that although the American industrial and commercial circles need talent so much, there are a large number of people in the country who are unemployed and idle at home, receiving government relief. This is not only a major loss to the national society, but also a major tragedy of the current social system.</p>
<p>It is said that the best students in American universities have already been recruited; and only one in 25 ordinary office clerks is qualified. It can be seen that some of the currently unemployed people are due to their own lack of ability, which should be remedied by hard work and self-study. However, there are also some people who have the will but lack the power. Although they are determined to improve, they cannot receive higher education and training due to economic reasons. It is practically impossible for them to become specialized technical talents. In this regard, the impracticality of modern education is probably also partly responsible.</p>
<p>What afflicts the current society is the problem of uneven nutrition.</p>

<h3>Vocational Clinic</h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>In the Soviet Union, where unemployment is not a problem, a system that has been quite effective in "how to bridge the gap between school education and professional life" has been implemented. This is the Soviet Union's youth "Vocational Clinic."</p>
<p>In the Soviet Union, a novel and sophisticated system of vocational guidance for young people has been considerably developed. When young people have completed their school courses and are preparing to choose a career, they have acquired extensive knowledge of various industrial sectors. This knowledge includes how to print books, how to bind books; how to spin, how to manufacture fabrics; how to prepare wood and preserve wood; including an understanding of all kinds of machines and their applications. In agriculture, they are familiar with spring planting and autumn planting in vegetable gardens, familiar with the raising of pigs and rabbits, and familiar with the working steps of collective farms and state-owned farms.</p>
<p>Every school has a relationship with nearby factories, farms, or machine stations, so that every student gets a chance to practice. After seven years of preliminary training, students are eligible to enter factory schools. Factory schools are attached to various specialized factories, and last for two years. The purpose is to enable students to acquire both theoretical knowledge and practical experience at the same time. In factory schools, students spend half of their time engaged in practical work and half of their time engaged in book research.</p>
<p>Every factory school has an important carrying equipment, which is the "Vocational Clinic." In other words, various specialized factories, in addition to setting up factory schools, also set up "Vocational Clinics." There is one psychologist for every 450 students. This psychologist must have the qualifications of graduating from a specialized college and having more than three years of teaching experience.</p>
<p>The purpose of the vocational clinic is to study the whole personality of children seeking work in factory schools, that is, the personality including genetic factors and environmental factors. Each child, whether male or female, is approached individually. In order to provide a basis for different teachings, teachers must know the different personalities of each child in their class. The records of each student kept in the central diagnostic department include his health condition, his various tests, the information about the external environment found by the psychologist during his first meeting with him, family background, relationship with parents and friends, what kind of books he reads, what kind of clubs he participates in, and his interests and knowledge of various occupations.</p>
<p>The vocational clinic administers various vocational tests to each child to indicate his various characteristics in his career, such as independence, etc. For students coming from outside Moscow, special attention is paid to their work in previous schools and the opinions of their previous teachers. One of the greatest functions of the Vocational Clinic is: adjusting the attitudes and realities of children, families and schools. Make a very thorough study of children's interests and abilities. If a child feels unpleasant or unsuitable for work in a certain factory school, the guidance department will transfer him to another factory school for readjustment.</p>
<p>After living in the factory school for two months, students must write a paper describing their impressions of the factory school. The vocational clinic has consultants who specialize in analyzing these papers, and the results of the analysis often lead to changes in teaching methods and sometimes even changes in factory equipment. These consultants often meet with the children's parents so that they can gain a deeper understanding of their children's ideals and interests.</p>

<h3>Pearl S. Buck on Books</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>"It is meaningless to read this book because others love to read it. I am willing to destroy all statistics on the world's best-selling books. The sales volume of any book, even in advertising, should be kept strictly secret, allowing readers to test their vision."</p>
<p>The above are the recent remarks of the American contemporary novelist Pearl S. Buck. Because according to the latest statistics from the New York book industry, her many novels and essays with China as the background occupy the first place in sales. Some people praised the excellence of her works, resulting in such satisfactory results. But she couldn't help but say the opposite.</p>
<p>Pearl S. Buck does not think that the best-selling of works must be a sign of substantial content. Many are because of the psychology of being shocked by the author's name, forming a kind of fashionable psychology. She herself admitted that none of the writer's products are entirely worth seeing. As far as she is concerned, the initial works are "The Good Earth", etc., which are indeed driven by interest; but later, under the urging of painting and silk, they are gradually regarded as commodities. In the commercial American society, any writer cannot be avoided.</p>
<p>Last year, Pearl S. Buck was stunned by the news that she had been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature and could not believe it. What she was worried about was the increasing sloppiness of her works, which would arouse possible condemnation from the public opinion circles. She did not expect that it would increase an unexpected honor.</p>
<p>However, Pearl S. Buck is different from ordinary profit-seeking booksellers after all. She does not want readers to blindly buy any best-selling books. She wants readers to release their selective vision and determine the readings that are most valuable in their minds. In a Chinese society with a broad readership, Pearl S. Buck's views are indeed quite applicable.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Feelings</p>
<h3>Boredom</h3>
<p>— Lei Xing</p>
<p>The first thing you always ask when you meet a friend is, "What have you been up to lately?" The answer is often the same, a blunt, "I'm so bored." There's even a hint of a smile on their lips.</p>
<p>Humans are truly strange creatures, deceiving themselves and yet feeling satisfied and proud. All those friends mentioned above hope to live for many more years. But, when I think about it for them, I truly feel sad. I want to shout aloud, "This is a waste of life, a shameful waste!"</p>
<p>I don't understand: Why would anyone let boredom entangle them? The world is so vast, isn't there so much that can be done? Cruel time will bury people; shouldn't we cherish our years?</p>
<p>There are many great figures in the world; they have already presented precious things to humanity. Yet, when they are on their deathbeds, they still say: I want to live. This clinging to life moves us.</p>
<p>Life is not about "passing the days." It should have meaning. The biggest question before you and me is "How should we live?"</p>
<p>Going back against the river of time, take out your own "record" and see what you've written? Or is it still a blank page?</p>
<p>The joy of life comes from a rich and fulfilling life. A faint smile after a job well done, how relaxing! That is something that money cannot buy. First, we must throw away boredom; we must "have something to talk about."</p>
<p>Young friends, remember: life should have a meaning, stop saying you are bored.</p>

<h3>Invisible Glass</h3>
<p>— Langhua</p>
<p>Dr. Bailu Qituo, a female doctor in New York, USA, recently invented a drug that, when applied to glass, can make it completely invisible.</p>
<p>When light passes through ordinary glass, only 92% can pass through, but when the drug invented by Ms. Bai is applied to the glass, the light that passes through reaches 99%.</p>
<p>Glass coated with this drug no longer reflects light, no matter how strong the light is. Clocks, shops, residences, etc., equipped with this kind of glass look as if there is no glass at all. If it is made into glasses, then people will no longer suffer from the inconvenience of light reflection.</p>
<p>Photography will also be greatly improved as a result. In the past, even with the best lenses, 8% of the light was lost. As for poorer lenses, only 25% to 35% of the light could reach the film. But since applying the drug to both sides of the lens, all the above shortcomings have completely disappeared.</p>
<p>The method of making this drug is quite secret. All we know is that it requires as many as six or seven kinds of raw materials. After the drug is made, it can be stored for a very long time.</p>
<p>However, after dyeing the glass slide with the drug, it must be immersed in an acidic solution in order to achieve satisfactory results.</p>

<h3>Economic Straits, Inability to Replicate: Japan Bans Color Films</h3>
<p>— Huazhi</p>
<p>Since the invasion of China, the film industry in Japan has been declining day by day. In order to save foreign exchange expenditures, the government has tightened the import ban on Western films. All the films shown in the cinemas are second- and third-rate films, and there is not a single great film. Movie fans feel extremely disappointed. In previous years, Japan screened no less than several hundred American films every year. Since the war, restrictions have been implemented. Last year, only 150 films were allowed to be imported, and this year it has been reduced to 80 films, which are evenly distributed by the eight Hollywood film companies stationed in Japan, with only ten films being allocated to each company. Moreover, each film is only allowed to import one copy. If there are not enough copies in Japanese cinemas, the other copies need to be printed in Japan, in order to recover some rights and interests for the country, which is really a helpless thing.</p>
<p>However, the Japanese are indeed better at imitating ordinary black and white films, but they have no way to deal with giant color films. Because color films have exclusive distribution rights in the United States. Compared with ordinary films, they have eight more production procedures, and Japan simply does not have such equipment. The most important thing is the import problem, because the transmission and sound of color films are in five parts which are a group, one cannot be missed. Therefore, importing one color film becomes five films, and ten films becomes fifty films.</p>
<p>Hollywood film merchants will discuss with the Japanese authorities a flexible way to import color films. It is said that each color film will be taxed at the value of five films, and will also be charged for the inspection fees of five films, and will also be subject to the editing procedures of five films. In this way, even if a color film is lucky enough to be released, the seat price will have to be increased four times and it cannot be guaranteed that the projection will be satisfactory. No wonder American film merchants sigh in despair, calling this method "unheard of in the world."</p>
<p>Since Japan has banned color films, the fifty giant color films that are now popular all over the world will no longer have the opportunity to meet with Japanese movie fans. The giant color films they most desire, such as Snow White, Robin Hood, The Little Princess, Gone with the Wind, and Pinocchio, can only be sighed at from afar.</p>
<h3>Hu Die Returns to the Screen</h3>
<p>"Peerless Beauty" Scheduled for Release</p>
<p>China's biggest star, Hu Die, has been away from movie fans for a long time, but now she is returning to the screen, which is not only the glory of Chinese cinema, but also a good news for moviegoers!</p>
<p>Ms. Hu's work to return to the screen this time is called "Peerless Beauty." It is a moving story about the life of Chen Yuanyuan, a beautiful school scribe in the late Ming Dynasty. This is Hu Die's first time acting in a costume drama, and she plays the daughter who is unwilling to serve the enemy. Every move and every smile of hers will surely make every audience member move with her performance.</p>
<p>"Peerless Beauty" is indeed an epoch-making masterpiece in the history of Chinese cinema. The talents included in this film, such as director Wang Jue Long, and stars such as Wang Yin, Wang Naidong, Jiang Junchao, and Bai Lu, are all the best choices. The photography and sound recording are enough to compete with imported films. The scenery is magnificent, antique, and extremely beautiful. It is the only thing seen in all past costume films. The capital spent on this aspect alone has reached 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>"Peerless Beauty" is produced by Huaxin and is scheduled to be screened at the New Light Grand Theater on the evening of the 21st. We are willing to sincerely recommend it to the audience. We believe that this film will definitely give the audience a refreshing experience.</p>
<p>The train started, and the naughty kids cheered in the car, heading for Happy Island. When they arrived at the beach, they and their car took a ferry to the island. From a distance, they could hear the band on the shore playing a welcome song, making a lot of noise. As soon as they landed, the mayor of Happy Island was even more attentive, shouting "Play! Play!" to welcome them.</p>
<p>Happy Island seemed really nice. Everywhere there were candy trees, candy houses, ice cream mountains, and the water in the streams was all lemonade. By the shore grew fluffy cattails, which were actually chocolate. These unmanaged wild children were even more absurd and outrageous here. Breaking windows, burning books, they did almost everything. Pinocchio met a little bad boy nicknamed Lampwick. Lampwick was the king of these black sheep, and he always led the way in mischief. Pinocchio spent every day in their ranks, avoiding meeting his "conscience." (6).</p>

<h3>Pinocchio</h3>
<p>— Yi Fan Excerpt</p>
<p>On Happy Island</p>
<p>Jiminy Cricket found the crossroads late at night. He saw Pinocchio had fallen into the hands of those two swindlers again. There was a four-wheeled carriage parked there, full of noisy, dirty, naughty children (Pinocchio was of course among them). When Jiminy Cricket arrived, the carriage was about to leave. He bitterly persuaded the puppet. Would he listen? No way, he had no choice but to jump into the carriage and go with them.</p>
<p>The driver waved his long whip and hit the four donkeys, the car</p>

<h3>Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Female Actors Should Not Sing "Yu Tang Chun" While Dressed Lightly</p>
<p>Insiders have a saying: "A qīngshānzi [female role] never freezes to death, a painted face never gets hot." This means that when singing a Qingyi role, even in the dead of winter when there is ice and snow on the ground, one must still wear a silk shirt and single pants on stage. It is absolutely impossible to wear a cotton-padded jacket and pants underneath. Conversely, those who play the Da Hualian or Hualian roles cannot remove the padded jacket inside the python robe and arrow jacket in the hottest weather when they are sweating like rain. Sometimes, an arrow jacket is added on top of the padded jacket, with pleats lining the arrow jacket, and then a python robe and jade belt are added on top. The head is also wearing a heavy helmet such as a Shuikui [general's helmet], Fuzikui [scholar's helmet], or golden or silver metal decorations. Before even trying hard, one is already drenched in sweat and unbearably hot. Moreover, even though the painted face is covered in sweat, one cannot wipe it with a towel. Traditionally, the actor playing the Hualian role must wear a padded jacket to show his mighty and majestic appearance. The problem of whether it is hot or not can only be ignored. Another thing is that actors playing other roles can sometimes sit down and rest on stage (in scenes where they should be seated), but the Hualian can only rest his buttocks on the seat with a very high cushion, which is no different from standing there. As for martial dramas, when fighting starts, one has to wear a padded jacket and fight vigorously, which is even hotter.</p>
<p>When singing a Qingyi role, in order to show a graceful and delicate posture, one naturally cannot dress in a bloated manner. Chinese women have always considered being frail and delicate as a condition of beauty. If one wears a cotton-padded coat underneath, it will affect the beauty of the figure, making the posture clumsy or the stage steps inflexible. Therefore, even in the severe winter, one must still perform on the red carpet in single pants and a single shirt. The outer Qing Rouzi [outer garment] is also made of silk, and the white silk skirt underneath cannot be relied upon for warmth. Moreover, the old theaters were drafty in all directions. If one were to encounter a scene like "Teaching the Son" or "Offering Sacrifice at the Pagoda" or "Offering Sacrifice to the River," performing the slow-paced erhuang or three-eyed fan erhuang, standing straight without any movements or steps, and shouting into the wind for a long time, wouldn't one freeze to death?
