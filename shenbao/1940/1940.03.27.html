<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本的政致與政策</h3>
<p>前昨兩日，本報旣就最近關於日本軍事侵略的挣扎，說明其到行逆施，進退維谷；就日本國際形勢的孤立，說明其計窮智竭，瀕陷絕境；各舉客觀實事之左證。茲請更就日本政制與其目前的政策，加以檢討。癡迷不悟，有時而似乎强毅有為；徬徨失措，有時而似乎持重審愼：日本似乎鍥而不舍，循序邁進，其實自趨歧途，一誤再誤。最簡明的說：日本對華所以發動軍事攻勢，實誤於估計中國的心與力；故滿望各個擊破而遭遇了全面抗戰，滿望速戰速決而遭遇了堅强的長期抗戰。日本所以發動外交攻勢，實誤於忽視國際的共同利害與條約基礎；故滿望以威脅戰勝一切，掠奪取得一切，空頭支票欺騙一切；而不料國際覷破一切，逐步强化其援華。日本所以發動政治攻勢，實誤於鋒鏑之下的和平，以為足資號召；而不知中國朝野以能吾獨立自由，能吾保持主權領土行政的完整，為和戰的唯一標準。日本一誤冉誤至於斯極，祗以其當局欲行險僥幸，以延續其短促的政治生命，遂自欺自凟，向歧途盲目挺進。蘇聯的史太林與莫洛托夫輩，能適應國際變局，幡然改圖　以與芬蘭議和，故雖初為世論所不直而終於所穫亦豐；日本無此偉大政家，故將不但一無所穫，且必自趨於崩潰落沒。請將日本方面當前的一個小節目為證：</p>
<p>日本發動政治攻勢，是根本的自欺自凟。它却假戲眞做，强顏顏歡笑，特地派人到南京；名義是特使，人選是大將級的前首相；如此排塲，無非表示其隆軍無以復加，似乎不是自欺而有其自信，似乎不是自凟而是自尊自愛。不料據東京傳來電訊，所謂特使的確實任務如何？留華期間的久暫如何？不但日本各報無法為之說明，即半官機關日本時報亦謂「特使負有特殊使命，但究屬何種性質，則政府尙未予以說明；」尤不但如此而已，業已奉命為特使的本人，亦不自諱飾其徬徨苦悶，而直接向各報記者公然謂　「余曾向米內首相表示，對於特使的權限任務，以及與外務省暨興亞院的關係，甚望能縝密加以研究」云云。任何國家，即使上追中古上古的國家，必先確切為了某種性質，確定為了某種任務，在某種行政系統之下，賦以某種權，課以某種責，然後設職定位而命官；乃現代的日本，以堂堂大將，充皇皇特使，確定了，餞行了，鋪張揚厲的宣傳了，而其性質如何，任務如何，權限如何，與其似相關聯的各機構之關係如何？還待入選者希望首相加以「硏究」加以「縝密的硏究」。這是古今中外政制上的奇蹟！小小節目，徬徨失措的心緒形跡，為之畢露。」</p>
<p>他們儘自欺自凟，我人可不聞不問；自食其報，類於可憐不足恤。但悲憫之念，由天賦而不能自己，因此還望日本猛回頭。日本在政制上應由內閣總理負政策的全部責任。近衛如何如何云云；近衛內閣倒了。平沼阿部兩閣承近衛之後，聲明蕭規曹隨；平沼阿部亦相繼倒了。現在的米內內閣，所說所行，較之前任，確有其實質上的種種嬗遞幻變；但大體不脫近衛窠臼，且力求遷就前任輪廓，復自命為宗法近衛；凡百自欺自凟，亦自應由米內自行負其責任。總之、依日本政制來說，日本雖已一誤再誤，却並沒有誤到深淵絕壑的必要；換言之，日本政制上賦予改弦易轍的餘地；睿智雄偉的明治天皇頒行憲法之際，給每一內閣首相以幡然改圖，補救闕失的機會。不日出發的特使，表示所謂承認問題，有待到了南京，考察了再說；這種表示，雖無甚意義，僅以見得特使地位之高，關係之大，但亦未始沒有持重謹愼的微意。倘若再不能持重謹愼、乃至再誤三四誤，使米內更為積重難返，則在政制上雖責任攸關，猶得留待後任首相來糾正，在事實上雖戰事未了，猶得留待中國抗戰勝利來糾正；然而為日本計之，又何苦繼續其自欺自凟？</p>
<p>或說這是日本的國策，斷乎不能變；望以更變，殆為虛願，其實國際問題安有片面國策決定一切之理。况日本政制之下，祗有內閣自行負責的政策，政策而為無數代內閣所繼承持續，亦祗是每一代內閣以繼承持續為政策而已，根本非有所謂為國策；稱其政策為一成不變的國策，則祗是內閣當局的自吹自唱，他何嘗能夠以政策拘束後任首相，因此之故，且莫謂中國抗戰必勝，祗須繼續抗戰，則關於日本的悔禍變　，終非虛願。但從日本政制的責任觀念來說，轉變其態度，更改其政策，舉無望於米內內閣。</p>
<h3>日軍部氣燄囂張　對政黨表示不妥協　醉心全能主義決蠻幹到底　武藤宣言引起全國大衝動</h3>

<h3>天虛我生逝世</h3>
<p>文學家天虛我生陳栩園氏、於本月二十四日十時逝世、氏於文學實業兩界、皆有偉大貢獻、著作百餘種、遺命囑其子女編次全集刋行、昨在世界殯儀館大殮、弔者數百人、雪涕痛悼、認為國家社會之一大損失、（續昨）下面是位接生女醫生被請出院接生的經過。某天午後七時，靑年會工業科轉來電話，請出院接生。產婦一家所住，只普通房間前半間的四分之一地位，原來那房間先分前後兩問，前半間再在窗戶的中部隔分，搭　擱樓；而擱樓上再用破舊傢其隔成四間。產婦所住的　間，有床舖，碗櫥各一，桌椅幾隻，都很汚穢，並且擁滿了衣杉骯髒的人。空氣鬱塞，但不寒冷，還有烹飪用的爐子一隻，並不生火。接生女醫生見到這種情况，便決定不在那裏觸及產婦，吿訴他們說，她在這種情勢下接生，勢必妨碍嬰孩和母親的安全和康健，而產婦和嬰孩或將得傳染病，甚至喪生。直到女醫生將離去時，產婦和她的丈　　於同意入醫院，然後山救火會救護車送產婦來院。入接生室時，產下一個健康的嬰孩，後來據接生女醫生吿訴我們道，她在救護車裏，恐怕產婦將在車內生產，可是，即使在車廂裏生產，也比在她家　好些。產後兩天，產婦堅決要回家，因為她巳有四個孩子，大的十一歲，小的綫三齡，沒有人能料理家務。她的丈夫必須出外工作，事前沒有請鄰居或親戚替她照顧家務。我們因為產婦有此困難，而身體又很康健，與常人無異，便在產後第三天准她出院。她還說再臥床上，實在耐不住了。</p>
<p>本年三月五日，有一四川籍產婦（二十四歲）乘人力車來院，嬰孩已產下，胞衣還未落下，母子都很安好。嬰孩裏衣後，哭聲響亮，送入育嬰室，產婦自稱抵院前，流血很多，但胞衣落下後，流血尙少，無論如何，她的狀况，無需特殊治療，便安然送進病房休養。她的一家，除本人和丈夫外，還有兩個女兒，一個八歲，一個五歲，都在先施公司游戲塲賣藝。每天獻技時間，從下午一時到八時，而在一到三時和六到八時登臺表演，下臺後，常練習下次表演的技藝。她的特殊技藝，是仰臥伸足，上站五人，做種種花樣或唱歌等，在她生產那晚，她還登臺表演，到八時才畢。在表演時，她雖稍感不適，但還不以為意，勉力照規定節目演技，到八時左右下臺，才乘人力車到醫院裏來。八時三十分，她在車上生產，她和丈夫每月各得包銀二十元，打去四分之一的折扣，兩人共得三十元，兩個孩子月得五六元，她以為她的工作很輕，休養一星期後，便出院再度登臺。</p>

<h3>神道辨</h3>
<p>前日恭錄論旨，頒賜山西太原關帝廟匾額；因山西旱災數年，成此巨荒，今賑務未竣，民散田蕪，撫臣率司道等，懷遵諭旨，虔誠祈禱，冀沛甘霖，設壇於省城關帝廟，果於三月初八日省城及各屬得雨數寸，十四十五二日又復大雨時行，農民深慰！此固由聖心宵旰焦勞，亦賴神靈默佑，故專摺奏報，並請欽頒匾額，讀摺內所陳，皆欣喜過望之詞，歸美君父，不自誇張，誠能得善則歸君之義矣。特不必請頒匾額，仰答神庥，則似棄人事神，愚衆人之耳目，揆之爲政之體，未免不務遠大，而但近小也。夫神者，造化之氣，陰陽合撰，無形無聲，古哲先賢，精氣不散，亦死而爲神，血食四方，與天地齊壽，則如關帝是已。然德盛化神，感應最大，禱雨之事，尙非所司。古時旱乾水溢，則變置社稷，是潦旱之災，應責於土神穀神，放去蟊賊，曰田祖有神，祈甘雨，曰以迓田祖，歲功旣畢，蠟祭始行，八者之中，亦主先嗇。而祭司嗇，沿及今日，州縣尙有社稷壇先農壇之祭，大抵祈晴禱雨，爲地方官之事，所祈禱之神，亦社稷壇之類，至於省城之中，首縣禱不騐，則首府出焉；府縣均不騐，然後督撫監司出焉；京城則先順天府大宛二縣，然後派親王等分詣拈香也。</p>

<h3>金融　華商狂結遠期外匯　供給者多係外銀行　套息約在四分光景</h3>

<h3>假後金市　大漲特漲　高峯見五三八五元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤巿况、生氣勃勃、較假前尤見精彩、登峯造極、結果在漲二百十二元之巨、續創金價最高紀錄、以人心之振奮、環境認為利多、故買戶戶異常擁擠、雖執貨者於高價內、時見出範、但均被吸收、頭寸供求、始終難以平衡、初開因外匯報緊巿氣已盛、價為五千二百三十元、嗣雖證券帮吐售曾微退數十元、但匯市斯時軟態未轉、更聞期貨緊勢奇俏、加之金號錢兌業等羣相爭購、重跳達五千三百二十元、延至午收尙站定於五千二百九十五元之上、豈意午後漲風變本加厲、中推某另一證劵帮巨額搜購、影響莫大、而港帮暗中活動亦形積極、致一時立見五千三百八十五元空前價格、且此後買賣仍感進多出少、牧盤遂吿五千三百七十元、全天交易頗旺、約三千餘兩、銀樓飾金步高二十元、創從未見過之貴價、海關金等均平、</p>
<p>烚赤猛抬二百餘元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開美匯報緊、人氣尤佳、買風涌漫、某金號暨銀號等抬價吸收、開市遂猛抬七十二元、金號進錢兌業五十兩、為五千二百三十元、少頃某證券帮多頭獲利鉅額出籠、漲勢頓被阻撓、不久回小三十元、錢兌業出銀號五十兩、為五千二百元、旋美匯續緊、並聞期貨尤軟、人心更振、錢兌業及現金號爭先猛進、再加散戶進多出少、而某證券帮賣意漸淡、是以漲風復起、竟又飛躍一百二十元、金號錢兌業共進證券帮五十兩、為五千三百二十元、此後銀號轉買為賣、而進者亦漸减少、且銀樓帮乘高頻塞、遂又回低三十二元、銀號出錢兌業五十兩、為五千二百八十八元、後以某錢兌業再來收買、重又抬起七元、銀號進證券帮二十兩、為五千二百九十五元作午收價、午後巿勢更形堅俏、開市即高三十元、銀號進證券帮三十兩、為五千三百二十五元、嗣加金號某錢兌業繼續猛進、再以某證券帮復代大戶加碼、且匯巿期貨尤緊、雖某錢兌業塞出有數、但仍感粥少僧多、遂再躍起四十五元、證券帮進銀號五十兩、為五千三百七十元、後現金號及散戶吐出、會回挫二十五元、金號出錢兌業三十兩、為五千三百四十五元、入後買風又起、某證劵帮復來搜購、重又漲起四十元、銀號進證劵帮四十兩、為五千三百八十五元、將近收盤時、某金號獲利復吐、立回十五元、金號出錢兌業三十兩、為五千三百七十元、作晚收價、結果比休假前竟猛漲二百十二元、全天一百八十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤高數元、收進减低二十元、現標金照掛脾金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>

<h3>外幣直綫上騰</h3>
<p>昨日外幣巿况、因英鎊跌風未戢、致此間黑巿美匯雖在匯豐暨花旗竭力維持中、但扒風終難抑制、遠期潛勢尤軟、蓋一般猶看鎊價有繼續下趨之可能也、故美金票益形鋒俏、買氣之盛、無以復加、巿價直綫奔騰、晚市又高至十六元一角五分之非常價、反之英金票趨勢甚軟、英美金鎊則隨余價飛漲未已、香港票跟港匯步漲、荷蘭票需要不弱、坎拿大票及斐列濱票跟美匯步緊、朝鮮票趨勢頗挺、晚巿高為九角九分五厘、僅日金票供給不絕、市氣萎靡、晚市退為一元三角一分六厘、昨日巿價、以英美金鎊漲四元半為最巨、次推坎拿大票之漲四角，美金票高三角三分、香港票大二分、荷蘭票高一角、斐律濱票升二角半、僅英金票跌五分、餘俱不量、</p>
<h3>糧食　米價易漲</h3>
<p>米由自前日漲足後、曾一度回疲、不敢貿然出手、除原根客販仍屬無意急脫依然守持外、其餘浮囤散戶心思、見有薄利可獲、頻頻脫出、迄中市各貨價降落迨將半元、若一號西貢已祗四十元零五角、二號三十七元半、火絞三十九元、小絞三十七元三角、詎市多變幻、巿貨突稀、一般作客欲謀　廉拉進、不易多得、乃內地帮出手搜求、致一動百動、無論零躉更覺暢旺、售方喊聲迭起、大局形勢、遂一反早市之疲態、回呈昂狀、悉將跌去者完全恢復、其時原根貨亦趁高推出、市貨漸見轉夥、迨收巿直無變化、以先疲後緊而論、適成平平、與前收盤價悉屬相仿、計一號西貢四十一元半、二號三十八元、火絞三十九元半、小紋二十八元、三十七元八角、暹羅持尖四十元零五角、四十元、二號三十八元半、三十八元、東京砶尖高自二十八元、次至三十七元、混合碎高三十四元、低迄三十二元、糯米市去路仍澀、續呈帶軟之象、厚薄粳及早晚稻等國米、因到源轉稀、及洋米堅緊、依然秀色、聞塲外暗盤頗多做開、崑高粳四十五元半、四十五元、中次四十三四元、靑泗眞特薄四十五元、市四十四元、早晚稻四十三元五六角、</p>
<p>洋米仔充到湧、在假期中續到三四萬包、途貸亦復源源不絕、故在匯縮金漲聲中、售價未能喊高、一號西貢四十一元五六角、比之前市相近、惟因新訂難劃、回籠期貨居奇堅守、現米雖未上漲、市形已經帶俏、而回籠期貨因與新訂價相差五六元、華洋商手貨均不肯隨市輕脫、而客帮與本街行囤需胃轉濃、市乃逐次見砌、期小紋初開原包四十五元、午後加起半元為四十五元半、二號西貢回籠現貨原包四十六元、四月份四十六元半、午後至四十六元七角半、一號開四十九元半後已喊到五十元、全日開出六百多噸、現貨亦有六千包之譜、</p>
<h3>洋麥將到　粉市暗鬆</h3>
<p>麵粉昨已開巿、交易依然淸閑、蓋緣廠盤自經改定十三元八角後、各粉號雖云平賣、而問津者已屬寥寥、聞老車牌零售每包由十四元改售十三元九角、回籠貨市面亦屬暗鬆、老東牌祇開十三元六角半、僅由內地及鄕莊之零星點綴而巳、至於客銷更見沉靜、廠方則尤思扳俏、尙不願供給、故市面平靜如常、</p>
<p>小麥交易、尙稱活動、日廠與出口去路、均感寂寞、而華廠則稍有問津、計由福新廠辦去六千五百包、阜豐廠辦去一百包、均係常州無錫幫麥、價為二十三元五角、巿面暫鮮重大變化、聞各廠前定洋麥、業已裝運在途、恐不久將有大批洋麥抵滬、故麥價前途、亦似粉巿暗鬆之象、</p>
<h3>證劵　洋銀行　股息均優</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日已照常開做、惟巿塲內部略有改革、尙在進行嚴密組織中、巿况情形初跌後漲、其震盪動機、初以為金子狂漲、且有發行余庫券之傳言、當然與公債不利、故巿價一度回小、在假前市價小三四角、入後一部份人頗有拉抬、又以為金庫券與公債有益、忽又回漲、比前反好起二三角、人心恍惚於此可見、其實金庫券之發行、完全為統制外匯、對外對內、必有一種暫定的比價、若謂與公債有利、則殊莫測高深、在此未能認淸利害時、尙有一番波折也、昨日上午同順仁昌以及一般散戶賣氣甚湧、丙種逐步疲落至八元四角、旋因聯益協大信孚等乘低吸收、市乃復趨上風、午後初平後堅、丙種曾達九元外、信孚聯益生大等頗有買進、餘如聯和同康永康等、取此捨彼、或捨此取彼、互相掉換交易而已、結果除丁種比前尙小一角外、餘均回好二三角至四角半、成交約百萬左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交寗紹輪船公司股一百股、價為十二元五角、比前已劇漲二三元之譜、</p>
<p>英商匯通洋行經理志摩橡皮有限公司、日前經董事會議決、定於四月四日召開第二十八次常年股東大會、據悉該公司一九三九年份盈餘達國幣二十餘萬元、除已派中期股息、每股國幣五分外、擬續派末次股息、每股國幣一角五分、兩共國幣二角、</p>
<p>英商大英自來火公司一九三九年份股息、每股擬派國幣八角、計合年息八厘、</p>

<h3>紗花　人心激昂　雙馬期紗　出一千元大關</h3>
<p>掃墓節休假後之紗市、續趨上漲、目形勢殊見緊張、此因美英匯兌趨縮、加之黃金飛騰、於是人心激昂、買風復起、巿盤乃扶搖直上、同時粵南實需益形發展、現紗基礎、日見鞏固、紗巿得此推動、漲力殊强、不過有一部份同業、因其底盤已臻高峯、不願做多、反見拋塞、但三月份二十支雙馬已穿一千元關外矣、四月期二十支雙馬頂高價已到一千零四十七元、回小至一千零一十五元、</p>
<p>現紗晨開市塲情况、尙屬和平、因在此封關中、海外棉市平平、有一部份同行條向拋賣、故二十支雙馬本月份開價為九百八十八元、四月份價為一千零十二元、微跌至一千零六元、旋聞外匯報縮、人氣重振、本月雙馬漲至九百九十元、四月份為一千零十八元、迨至將近十一時、黃金飛升、買潮劇烈、直漲至一千零三十七元、本月亦達一千零十元、不過收盤之後稍形回落十餘元、查半日間成交統計二千九百五十八包、行情二十支變馬現貨漲二十一元、期貨漲一十六元、茲將各帮買去之額量列左、香港　九三五　內地　二〇同行　一、九九五　統計　二、九五〇</p>
<h3>棉花漲力　不及紗之挺</h3>
<p>本棉交易不旺、但美棉生意特見興盛、故市情尙和緩、廠胃不開、而同行心思依然有好、不過目前受銀根關係、加之外棉氣勢平平、所以棉巿漲力不及紗市之挺括也、蘇北來源計通花七百九十六包、茲將現棉情形成交列左、米特林　二六一·五〇　二六四·二五　同行進　一、二〇〇件通打包　二一〇·〇〇　又　一八〇件杭州花　一九二·〇〇　又　四九九包常熱花　二〇八·二五　又　二〇〇包太倉花　二一〇·〇〇　又　二〇〇包</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日晨初先因海外棉商之在巿賣出、市况頗呈疲乏之狀、後因華爾街之購買及一部份空頭抵補、故棉價稍形轉上、結果收盤價格近期跌三五磅音、遠期漲二磅音，印度棉市、昨日連同預測跌落三羅比餘、埃及停市、</p>
<h3>市况彙誌</h3>
<p>布市　晨開、即吿微漲、嗣以黃金暴騰、客路實需及囤戶競先購進、巿盤節節上升、較晨市每疋續漲五角一元之巨、結果富貴·大鵬細布較二十一日市盤每疋跳起二元半、餘檔細布·斜紋亦漲五角至七角半、粗布漲二角半一元、漂染布漲五角至一元、本街成交各布在千件以上、浙路溫甬帮辦細布·漂染布三百餘件、閩粵帮辦二百餘件、川滇帮辦色布·錢呢·細布等二百餘」、</p>
<p>油市　昨趨勢平定、午後謠傳花生油產　猛降、故豆油亦受打擊、人心一致看小、全市祇　午做開靑島生油二十桶、及　北本坊油十桶、大連豆油二百七十桶、膠州豆油三百件、江北及常州油三十桶、價均削一二元、</p>

<h3>「兒童圖書館」成立之前</h3>
<p>— 郭民强</p>
<p>作爲「兒童圖書館」的一萬五千元的經費，」經在開始捐募了。這個圖書館的成立也將在今年兒童節後正式成立（日期未定）。這不是兒童們的福音嗎？當然啦！兒童們對於這件事一定是很興奮而且抱着莫大的希望的。</p>
<p>我雖然是大孩子，但是對於這件有益於兒童的事，也是懷着很大的熱望的，今謹以至誠，將我個人對於一兒童圖臀館」的一些貢獻，寫在下面：</p>
<p>訓練兒童是應以兒童身心的發展及以正義之道德基礎爲出發點，所以兒童圖書館所收集的書應該是：</p>
<p>（一）注重於兒童身心方面的修養。</p>
<p>（二）多多附上挿圖，而且圖畫最好是印有顏色的。</p>
<p>（三）上海的環境雖然是很惡劣，但是我們不應該因爲環境的惡劣而把兒童精神上的食糧改變。這就是說，在可能範圍內，我們還應多多收集些對於抗戰有益的兒童書籍。</p>
<p>關於收費方面，我亦有如下的意見：</p>
<p>（一）由學校保送加入圖書館的兒童，保證金不收。</p>
<p>（二）爲獎勵讀書起見，每校之優秀及模範兒童得免收保證金及借書費。</p>
<p>（三）每年的借書費越低越好，窮苦的兒童選可以分期繳納。保證金亦應低廉，窮苦的兒童並得申請免費。</p>
<p>（四）入館閱覽的兒童，閱覽費不收。</p>
<p>我想以上這些小小的意見也可以給「兒童圖書館」籌備委員會作一個參考吧。</p>
<p>最後，我希望全滬的仕女們多多捐些錢來充實這個兒童圖書館。這是全滬兒童的幸福，也是自己的兒童的幸福</p>
<h3>澈底的「防癆運動」</h3>
<p>— 俚夫</p>
<p>基茲先生說。。「在下曆階級裏推行防癆運動，除大施宣傳，叫他們講究衛生……以外，還要施行一番普遍的檢查，有肺癆病的人，就叫他搬開；替他治療。」不錯！這寳貴的意見，無疑地是防止肺癆傳染的最好方法。不過可憐的下層階級的人，大多數連吃都成問題，那來整筆的款子，用作治療的醫藥費呢？又有誰肯担負「替他治療」的責任呢？然而要使「防癆運動」澈底，要提高「防癆運動」的價値，就非「替他治療」不可。須知防癆要從除癆着手，治愈患者，撲滅癆菌，擺脫傅染的厄運，那才是防癆的根本辦法。</p>
<p>大家知道，肺癆是極慢性的病症。求治者除要有充分的時間而外，還需要安適的環境，最妥當的，莫過於入療養醫院，俾一面根據合理療養方法，一面復加以手術治療，那才有治愈的把握。但在以金錢爲衡量階級標凖的現社會上，即使住一美其名曰慈善醫院的三等病房，每人一月所費，也在百元上下，所以常下層階級發覺染患肺癆後，能得合理治療，推而有治愈之把握者，實在寥寥無幾。</p>
<p>要拯救那成千累萬的下層階級的肺癆患者，要撲滅癆菌，防杜傳染，使「防癆運動」更臻澈底的詁，但願防癆當局從諸大善士的巨額捐款中劃撥大數，用以籌創正眞平民化的療養醫院，聘用爲「醫生」而醫生的專門人材，來支持這澈底的防癆工作。要是限於財力，而無法辦到這樣程度的話，至少也得提出捐款的一部份，撥補可靠的療養醫院，作爲三等病人的醫藥費，以减低貧病的負掛，能這樣，「防癆運動」才有豐滿的收穫。</p>
<p>最後敬以萬分的眞誠，懇我社會名流，熱心善士，負起「救命」的責任，慷慨解囊，踴躍輸將，共同來完成澈底的「防癆運動」。</p>
<h3>一年讀書究竟有幾天</h3>
<p>— 孫鼎奎</p>
<p>夏鬱奮君的「一年讀書有幾天」登出以後，就接到孫鼎奎君的稿件，說明夏君未把春假暑假寒假中的星期日在「星期日五十二天」內扣除，因之，他所計算的日子並不準確。但是當期因篇幅關係，未及刋出。上期又因張一廖先生的專稿，又得延後一期。而在這時期內，接到關於這問題的來稿不下四五十封，且大都是各校同學們寄來的，這定見同學們對於「求學時間」的注意，這正如夏君寫那篇稿件的本意一檬，準確不準確是另外一個問題，所以我還把夏君的結語抄在下面：「人生是短促的，靑春是寳貴的，求學的機會是難逢的，應該如何的努力，才不負了這可貴的學年！」以贈諸同學，來稿恕不一一披露了。（編者）</p>
<p>一個學生不吿假每學期在校讀書的日子究竟有幾天這個問題，不是前天本刋已經載着一個統計嗎，不過這個統計是有着一點出入的，因爲作者在假期內的「星期日」並未在「五十二天」內扣去，至於暑假日期的長短，或許是大學與中小學的不同。</p>
<p>春假七天（內星期日一天暑假（七月四日至八月二十一止）四十九天（內星期日七天）</p>
<p>年假三天</p>
<p>寒假十四天（內星期日二天）</p>
<p>以上根據敎育部中小學學校行事歷，再加</p>
<p>星期日五十二天（應除假期內十天）</p>
<p>星期六下午不是普遍休息，或有停課的學校，也在舉辦兒童各種中心活動，這也是實施教育，不得作假期論。</p>
<p>以上合計假期共一百二十三天，至於例外的假期，各校校慶每年只有一天；因考試而停課，每學期約計三四天不等，作四天算，一年八天，共計假日一百三十一天。，敎師缺課，學校當局理應設法補足。照這樣算法，一年三百六十五天還有一百三十三天的日子上課，一學期就有一百十六天半了。和昨天的統計，不是相差很多嗎？不過在校的學生，不要以爲讀書的日子多了起來，而隨便的曠課，還是要尊照夏君的忠吿去埋頭苦幹呀。</p>
<h3>陳陶遺</h3>
<p>— 履陶</p>
<p>自從日前大美晚報將新貴中之司法行政部長張孝栘誤譯爲陳陶遺，頓將久不爲社會注意之陳陶遺，忽焉於此十二小時中起人注意，直至翌日日報載明爲張孝栘，大美晚報又鄭重更正，深致歉忱，於是始恍然於誤譯之由來。</p>
<p>要知張與陳，在英文拼音中，只有一字之差，栘與遺，音相似，孝與陶雖不同，但在某地方言下讀之，或許相近。何况張孝移的大名，在南方人是少聞見，怪不得一時要誤會到陳陶遺了。</p>
<p>至於陳陶遺之篇人，大美晚報的「高風亮節，萬方景仰」，固然見得陳陶遺的人格；而雙于道人湯定之爲陳氏客室所題的「息緣閉戶，養病知閑」，更見得陳氏的胸襟，非同流俗，於以見烈風而後知勁草爲不謬了！</p>

<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第廿二回　新聞要訉天外飛來　崇議宏論人間信仰</p>
<p>看了排字房以後，她們便到二層樓編輯　來了。這個時候，也是每天的晚報已經竣事，而明天的晨刊尙未上工。大概也都要晚餐以後，編輯員漸漸到來，開始工作。所以一間人廣間的編輯室，望進去空堂堂的沒有幾個人。裏面排列的桌子，各各不同。有的排列成圓桌形的，有的排列成長方形的，有的排列成丁字形的，有的棑列成凹字形的。有些桌子，還都是特別製造起來的。而每個桌子上，都有一具至數具的電話機。吳君素問道：『這些編輯員，每天都要到齊的嗎？』瞿無豐道：『旣然是一個日報的編輯員，當然每天都要到的。然而也小能盡行到齊，大概每天也至少到十分之七。因爲有的是奉了館方之命，特別到國內外去的。有的是出外游歷，以增長知識的。有的是在休假中，可以不到館的。大爲新聞事業，是終年無停刊的，不比別的事業，還有星期休假之例。所以當新聞記者的人，每人每年，有兩個月的例假，以補星期休息之缺，在這例假中，當然薪水照給，而他們可以出外遨遊，以舒長日身心之　。至於他所擔任的事，可以由別人代庖，別人例假的時候，他也須爲別人代庖，於業務上，却不至有所妨碍呢。』那時何儷玉又問道：『你們這編輯室裏，那種桌子的排列法，也有甚麼關係嗎？』瞿無雙笑道：『這是沒有甚麼較大的關係，不過每一部份的坐在一起，便在討　析疑罷了。所以排列的桌子，也成爲一組一組的了。譬如我們的新聞，分三大部份，就是（一）國外之部；（二）國內之部；（三）本市之部。國外之部內，又分出歐洲　，美洲組，亞洲組來。國內之部內，分組可就多了，即就中國本部的她域，就分了好幾組，譬如像從前，蒙藏成爲一組的，稱之爲蒙藏組。但現在蒙藏日漸開發，而地域又相距甚遙，決小能併爲一組，所以已分成蒙古組，西藏組了。本市之部內的分析，不是平面的，而是立體的。大概是分出商業組，工業組，外僑組，社會組，文化組等等名目而已。每一部有個部長，每一組有個組長，他們當然都願意聚在一處，所以他們辦事的桌子，也安放在一處了。（二五五）</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Retreat on Three Routes from Lingshan; Chinese Forces in Southern Guangxi Concentrate Along the Yongqin Highway; Remnants of Japanese Troops Who Broke Through from Wuyuan Completely Annihilated</h3>
<p>Chongqing—According to a military dispatch from the Chinese side, the Japanese troops in Lingshan are now retreating westward on three routes. One route of Japanese troops north of Lingshan is retreating towards Nanning; another route is retreating towards Qinzhou via Wuli and Bolao; and the third route is retreating towards Xiaodong on the Yongqin Highway. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Lanzhou—Since the Chinese forces in Suiyuan launched their offensive against the Japanese on the 20th, after three days of fierce fighting, they successively captured the strategically important northwestern town of Wuyuan and the key point of Xishan Zui, annihilating more than 3,400 Japanese troops. Only a small number of remnant Japanese troops, led by Lieutenant General Shuichuan, Commander-in-Chief of the Suiyuan Garrison, broke through from the old city of Wuyuan and fled. On the evening of the 22nd, they arrived at Erzhou Gou, where they were once again surrounded and attacked by the Chinese forces. After four hours of intense fighting, the remnant Japanese troops were completely annihilated. The Japanese commander Shuichuan was also killed on the spot by the Chinese forces. The Chinese forces thus completed a glorious and heroic large-scale annihilation battle. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing—Chinese forces in southern Guangxi are concentrating along the Yongqin Highway, preparing to launch an offensive against the Japanese troops on that road. (United Press, 26th)</p>
<p>Xuwen—The Japanese troops who harassed the mainland from Qiongshan and Wenchang have suffered heavy casualties after being severely attacked by the Chinese forces. On the 17th, they retreated in different directions towards Caogou and Dingcheng, and the Chinese forces are still pursuing them. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing—This morning at dawn, a unit of Japanese troops invaded northward along the Luxi Highway and was intercepted by the Chinese forces at Shangxiakeng near Huangtang. The Japanese suffered losses and retreated to Henggang. The Chinese forces took advantage of the victory to pursue them, and more than half of the Japanese troops were annihilated. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Guangzhou—A spokesman for the Japanese Army here recently reviewed military operations in South China, stating that some Japanese troops have retreated from the Nanning area to Hainan Island, Zhongshan, and Shantou to fight. The Japanese army has decided to continue to occupy Zhongshan. Last October, the Japanese army first decided to occupy Zhongshan with the aim of cutting off transportation. After the mission was accomplished, they withdrew. However, after the Japanese army left, they received reports that guerrillas and officials of the Chinese government were once again active in Shiqi. Therefore, the Japanese army began an offensive on the 5th of this month. The Japanese troops who landed at Xiangzhou immediately cut off the highway from Macau to Shiqi. Another two routes landed at Tangjiawan and Zhouqi (transliteration) west of Shiqi. These three routes of Japanese troops attacked Shiqi simultaneously at 10:00 AM on the 8th, leaving a small detachment to guard the area, while the main force pursued the retreating Chinese troops. As for Hainan Island, although the Japanese army occupied it in February of last year, the Chinese forces in the interior of the island are quite active. Therefore, the Japanese army and navy decided to take joint action and launched an offensive on the 4th of this month. Naval units have landed at six points on the west, south, and north coasts, advancing towards the center of the island, while the army is stationed in the northeast and east, cutting off the retreat of the Chinese forces. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>The Recovery of Two Cities in Wuyuan</p>
<p>Wuyuan—A reporter interviewed a certain general at the front line and learned the following about the great annihilation in Wuyuan. The Chinese forces in Suiyuan divided and surrounded the Japanese troops who invaded the Houtao area, annihilating them in sections. In February, there were 51 fierce battles, killing more than 2,800 Japanese troops. Starting from March 18, a large-scale annihilation was launched against the Japanese troops entrenched in Wuyuan and various strongholds east of the Fengji Canal. On the evening of the 20th, the Chinese forces, with swift action and clever tactics, advanced simultaneously towards the old and new cities of Wuyuan. One unit attacked the Xiguan and Beidou of the new city, engaging in fierce battles with the Japanese troops. At the same time, another unit, in a mobile formation, bypassed the southeast and south sides and suddenly attacked the central area of the city, fiercely attacking the headquarters and communications organs of the Japanese commander Shuichuan. The Japanese troops stubbornly resisted, launching fierce street battles. The unit of Chinese forces attacking the old city occupied the north of the city at 11:00 PM that night and continued to advance, breaking into the city from the Beiguan and occupying the Yingpan, the highest stronghold. The Japanese troops then used the county government and factories as strongholds, stubbornly resisting the Chinese forces and waiting for reinforcements. On the 21st and 22nd, four Japanese aircraft bombed the old and new cities in an interlocking pattern to assist in the battle, and also released a large amount of poison gas. Chinese officers and soldiers disregarded their own safety, engaged in hand-to-hand combat, and fought a bloody battle for two days and nights, finally completely recapturing the two cities, killing 1,400 Japanese troops, including more than 200 Japanese advisers dispatched by the Japanese garrison in Mengjiang. Except for more than ten Japanese instructors, including the Japanese instructor Kanya Isamu, the rest were annihilated. Countless war trophies were seized. The remnant Japanese troops retreated to the east of the city. Subsequently, the Chinese forces pursued them in different directions and launched another fierce battle in the suburbs until the evening of the 22nd, finally annihilating all the Japanese troops in the above-mentioned areas without exception. The communication line between Wuyuan, Linhe, and Shan was thus opened up. It is estimated that from the 18th to 8:00 PM on the 22nd, the heroic Chinese officers and soldiers fought a bloody battle for 137 hours, killing a total of more than 3,400 Japanese troops, and have completed the satisfactory goal of annihilating the Japanese troops. They are currently launching a fierce offensive and mopping-up operation against the Japanese troops who are retreating and those who have twice rushed from Baotou to provide reinforcements. Another unit of Chinese forces captured Xishanzui, a strategic point on the Baowu Highway, cutting off the Japanese retreat route, and are advancing sharply towards the Ula Mountains. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing—Today, the bells here rang melodiously, celebrating the Chinese forces' recapture of Lingshan in Guangxi and Wuyuan in Suiyuan. At the same time, Liu Zhi, commander of the Chongqing Garrison, and Mayor Wu Guozhen held a spring festival in the Guan Temple. According to the Chinese side, the recapture of Wuyuan in Suiyuan was due to the cooperation of Ma Hongkui's Ningxia Hui cavalry, Ma Zhanshan's cavalry, the Eighth Route Army's guerrilla units, Fu Zuoyi's infantry, the Inner Mongolian Self-Defense Army, and the Central Army, combined with heavy artillery, launching a simultaneous attack. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Lanzhou—It is learned here that the great victory in Suiyuan, with the successive recapture of Wuyuan and Xishanzui, is extremely exciting. The Gansu-Qinghai circles' Sui-Ning front-line comfort delegation, led by Zeng Kuangqing, is scheduled to depart from Lanzhou on the 27th to comfort the troops at the front line. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Forces in Northern Henan Inflict Heavy Losses on the Japanese</h3>
<p>Luoyang—The Chinese forces in northern Henan have repeatedly attacked the Daoqing Railway. On the evening of the 20th, they attacked the Jiaozuo-Lihe railway bridge, annihilating all the Japanese soldiers guarding the bridge and completely destroying the railway bridge. On the evening of the 21st, they attacked the railway again, and the Japanese soldiers guarding the railway were unable to resist and retreated. More than 100 telephone poles, telephone lines, and many other spoils of war were destroyed. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhengzhou—On the morning of the 21st, more than ten Japanese automobiles loaded with infantry, along with a unit of cavalry and two cannons, invaded the areas of Guanzhuang, Kongzhuang, Lizhuang, and Xuwan. The Chinese forces intercepted them head-on with one unit, while another unit quickly moved to the flanks of the Japanese troops. When the Japanese realized this, they were already surrounded by the Chinese forces. They dared not engage in battle and fled in panic. They were repeatedly killed by the Chinese forces along the way, and suffered heavy losses. The Chinese forces are currently pursuing them in victory. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Unfolds in Southern Anhui</h3>
<p>Tunxi—The fighting in the Zhizhi area of ​​southern Anhui was still unfolding fiercely on the 25th. Japanese troops advanced towards the Chinese forces again at Ziziqiao, north of Zhizhi. The battle was quite fierce, but the Japanese were eventually unable to resist and retreated. The fighting was even more intense at Wuyueshan, northeast of Zhizhi, and Xiaomeiling, east of Wuyueshan. When the Japanese troops launched a large-scale attack, the Chinese forces bravely counterattacked. After two rounds of contention, the Japanese ultimately failed. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Fuliang—Japanese troops in southern Anhui have recently launched another attack. On the 23rd, they engaged in a fierce battle with the Chinese forces near Dieshi Mountain. Under the fierce bombing of Japanese aircraft, the Chinese forces bravely charged and killed many Japanese troops. The bloody battle continued until night. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hunan Provincial Council Sends Telegram of Condolences to Wounded Soldiers</h3>
<p>Leiyang—The Hunan Provincial Provisional Council recently sent a telegram to all wounded soldiers throughout the country, saying, "Gentlemen, you have devoted yourselves to the Party and the country, and have always been loyal. Your service on the battlefield is especially admirable for your great courage. You cherish the lofty ambition of being wrapped in horsehide and returning, and you embrace the determination to sacrifice yourselves for righteousness. You return with wounds and bring glory with you. It is hoped that you will recover your health as soon as possible, return to the front line, complete your unfinished achievements, and strive for final victory. We hereby extend our condolences to express our respect. Zhao Hengti, Speaker of the Hunan Provincial Provisional Council, Chen Runlin, Deputy Speaker, and all Councilors pay their respects." (25th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chongqing City Hastens Construction of New Air-Raid Shelters</h3>
<p>Chongqing—Chongqing Mayor Wu Guozhen stated in a speech today that there are currently 425,000 residents here, and the city's air-raid shelters can now accommodate 200,000 people. However, the new air-raid shelters, which are expected to be completed before June, can accommodate another 100,000 people. Mayor Wu continued that the income of laborers has greatly increased, so they are not affected by rising prices. Before the war, an ordinary laborer here could only buy half a liter of rice per day, but now their income can buy two liters of rice. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Platoon Leader Seizes Machine Gun Barehanded</h3>
<p>Gao'an—When a certain platoon leader, Meng Zhaomin, of the ××th Regiment of a certain division of the Chinese army attacked the Japanese army on the highlands northeast of Gao'an a month ago, he sneaked into a Japanese machine gun position barehanded and threw sand at it, blinding the Japanese machine gunners and preventing them from firing. At that time, another Japanese soldier saw this and stabbed Meng's left arm with a bayonet. The knife went deep into Meng's arm and could not be pulled out. In desperation, Meng threw sand at the other Japanese soldier as well, also blinding him, and quickly seized the machine gun with his left hand. The two Japanese soldiers panicked and fled. Meng quickly carried the seized machine gun back, completely forgetting that he had been injured. When this matter was reported to the senior officer of the unit, he gave Meng a special commendation. Meng has now been transferred to the rear for treatment. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Nanyang Overseas Chinese Comfort Mission, Chen Jiageng, et al., Arrive in Chongqing; Chongqing Circles Warmly Welcome; Will Go to Various War Zones to Conduct Comfort Activities</h3>
<p>Chongqing—Chen Jiageng, initiator of the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Returned Home Comfort Mission and chairman of the Overseas Chinese Relief Association, Deputy Chairman Zhuang Xiyan, mission members Wang Zhenxiang, leader of the overseas Chinese in Perak, Chen Qinghu, leader of the overseas Chinese in Penang, and Chen's secretary Li Tiemin, a party of five people, took off from Yangon at 6:30 on the morning of the 26th and returned to China. At 1:37 PM, they passed through Kunming, and at 4:15 PM, they arrived in Chongqing. Representatives of more than 200 units and organizations, more than 500 people in total, stood in the airport to greet them starting at 1:00 PM that afternoon. The representatives included Jiang Weiyuan's representatives Ying Yian, Wu Tiecheng, Xiao Jishan, Chen Shuren, Xu Shiying, Chen Cheng's representative Fan Yang, Zhang Jiaao, Zhang Zhijiang, Shao Lizi, Hong Lanyou, Gao Lingbai, and representatives of various ministries, commissions, central departments, party, government, and military organizations, and various mass organizations. After the Central Aviation Transport plane landed, Wu Tiecheng was the first to step forward to greet them and express his welcome. Then, Ms. Ma Shen Huiyun and Chen Yiyun, representatives of the Women's Comfort Association, presented flowers, and students from Xiamen University and Jimei University presented flags. Chen, Zhuang, and others shook hands with the welcomers, and the welcomers shouted slogans. Chen, Zhuang, and others smiled and nodded frequently to express their thanks. After having some refreshments in the lounge, Chen stood up amid applause and gave a speech, first expressing his gratitude to the welcomers, and then stating that the tasks of this trip were roughly as follows: (1) To preside over the affairs of the Overseas Chinese Returned Home Comfort Mission; (2) To plan to establish a pharmaceutical factory in China to manufacture medicines needed by soldiers fighting the war; (3) To investigate the road transportation situation; (4) To visit the commanders-in-chief in various war zones, to pay tribute and offer comfort. All of these are pre-planned, and whether there will be any changes in the future will depend on the transportation situation and the actual situation. He also said that he would like to avoid all social engagements in order to save energy and resources. Finally, he said that he hoped that we would unite sincerely and work together to resist the war and build the country, and do our best. Chen is now 67 years old. Although he had traveled in transit today, he was energetic and not tired at all. When he spoke, his tone was firm and powerful, and his voice was loud. His enthusiasm for protecting the motherland and his belief in the victory of the war were overflowing with his words. The entire audience applauded continuously. Then Zhuang Xiyan continued, "Tens of millions of overseas Chinese only know to support the central government, support the leader, and resist the war to the end." It was already evening, and Chen, Zhuang, and others took a car to the Jialing New Village, their designated residence, to rest. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Kunming—The Nanyang Overseas Chinese Returned Home Comfort Mission was originally divided into two routes to return to China. One group flew from Yangon to Kunming on the 26th at noon and transferred to the capital of temporary wartime government. When passing through Kunming, Vice-Chairman Guo Meipi and member Wang Huairen got off the plane. Many people who heard the news went to welcome them. Guo plans to wait in Kunming for a group of members returning from the Yunnan-Burma Highway before traveling to Chongqing together. The plane that flew to Chongqing included Chen Jiageng, chairman of the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Relief Association, Zhuang Xiyan, deputy chairman, and five others. (26th Dispatch) Kunming—The Nanyang Overseas Chinese Comfort Mission is now divided into two routes to return to China. One route consists of representatives from Malaysia, Java, and other places, about 40 people, who entered Yunnan via Burma and left Yangon on the 15th, passing through Baoshan on the 25th and heading east. The other route returns to China via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and is expected to arrive in Kunming by the end of the month. The circles here believe that overseas Chinese are enthusiastic about saving the country, which is worthy of admiration, and have specially prepared grand welcome activities and designated the Taihua Hotel as the delegation's accommodation. The Central Overseas Department also sent Luo Guanghai to Yunnan to represent the welcome and arrived in Kunming a few days ago. (25th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japan's Political System and Policies</h3>
<p>In the past two days, this newspaper has already explained the recent struggles of Japan's military aggression, pointing out its perverse actions, advancing and retreating with difficulty; and explained the isolation of Japan's international situation, pointing out its exhausted plans and wisdom, and its impending predicament; each with objective facts as evidence. Now, let us further examine Japan's political system and its current policies. Sometimes it seems resolute and promising due to its obsessed incomprehension; sometimes it seems cautious and prudent due to its hesitation and confusion: Japan seems to be persevering and advancing step by step, but in fact it is going astray, making one mistake after another. To put it most simply: Japan's military offensive against China was actually a mistake in estimating China's heart and strength; therefore, it expected to defeat them one by one but encountered a full-scale war of resistance, and expected a quick victory but encountered a strong long-term war of resistance. Japan's diplomatic offensive was actually a mistake in neglecting the common interests and treaty basis of the international community; therefore, it expected to conquer everything with threats, plunder everything, and deceive everything with empty promises; but it did not expect the international community to see through everything and gradually strengthen its aid to China. Japan's political offensive was actually a mistake in believing that peace under the sword could be used as a call to action; but it did not know that the Chinese government and people regarded the ability to be independent and free, and the ability to maintain the integrity of sovereignty, territory, and administration, as the only standard for peace and war. Japan has made one mistake after another to this extreme, only because its authorities want to take risks and be lucky to prolong their short political lives, so they deceive themselves and blindly move forward on the wrong path. Stalin and Molotov of the Soviet Union were able to adapt to the changing international situation and change their plans to negotiate peace with Finland, so although they were initially disapproved of by the world, they eventually gained a lot; Japan does not have such great politicians, so it will not only gain nothing, but will inevitably lead itself to collapse and decline. Please take a small episode on the Japanese side as proof:</p>
<p>Japan's launching of a political offensive is a fundamental self-deception. But it pretends to be doing something real, forces a smile, and specially sends someone to Nanjing; the title is special envoy, and the person chosen is a former prime minister of the rank of general; such an arrangement is nothing more than to show its unparalleled emphasis on the military, and it seems that it is not self-deception but has its own confidence, it seems that it is not self-deception but self-respect and self-love. Unexpectedly, according to dispatches from Tokyo, what is the real task of the so-called special envoy? How long will he stay in China? Not only can Japanese newspapers not explain it, but even the semi-official organ The Japan Times said that "the special envoy has a special mission, but the government has not yet explained what kind of nature it belongs to;" Not only that, but the person who has been ordered to be the special envoy also does not hide his hesitation and distress, and publicly said to reporters that "I have expressed to Prime Minister Yonai that I hope that the authority and tasks of the special envoy, as well as the relationship with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Xingya Institute, can be carefully studied." In any country, even those dating back to the Middle Ages and ancient times, it is necessary to first accurately determine a certain nature, determine a certain task, under a certain administrative system, give a certain power, and assign a certain responsibility, and then set up a position and appoint an official; but in modern Japan, a general is appointed as a special envoy in a grand manner, the mission is determined, the farewell ceremony is held, and the propaganda is spread widely, but what is its nature, what is its task, what is its authority, and what is the relationship with various related institutions? The person to be selected is still waiting for the prime minister to "study" and "carefully study". This is a miracle in the political systems of ancient and modern China and foreign countries! This small episode reveals the heart of hesitation and confusion."</p>
<p>They are welcome to deceive themselves, but we cannot ignore it; they deserve their own punishment, and are too pitiful to be pitied. But the thought of compassion is innate and cannot be stopped, so I still hope that Japan will turn back. In terms of political system, Japan should have the prime minister of the cabinet bear full responsibility for policies. What about Konoe, etc.? The Konoe cabinet collapsed. The Hiruma and Abe cabinets followed Konoe, declaring that they would follow the old rules; Hiruma and Abe also collapsed one after another. The current Yonai cabinet has indeed made various changes in substance compared to its predecessors in what it says and does; but in general, it does not break away from Konoe's old habits, and strives to accommodate the outlines of its predecessors, and claims to follow Konoe's ancestral laws; all self-deception should also be borne by Yonai himself. In short, according to the Japanese political system, although Japan has made one mistake after another, it has not made the mistake of falling into a deep abyss; in other words, the Japanese political system gives room for changing course; when the wise and great Emperor Meiji promulgated the constitution, he gave every cabinet prime minister the opportunity to change course and remedy the shortcomings. The special envoy who is about to leave said that the so-called recognition problem needs to be discussed after arriving in Nanjing and examining it; although this statement has no meaning, it only shows the high status and great relationship of the special envoy, but it may not be without a slight intention of prudence. If it is still impossible to be cautious, and even make three or four more mistakes, making Yonai even more difficult to turn back, then although the responsibility is relevant in the political system, it must be left to the subsequent prime minister to correct it, and although the war is not over in fact, it must be left to the Chinese war of resistance to correct it; but as far as Japan is concerned, why bother to continue its self-deception?</p>
<p>Some say that this is Japan's national policy and cannot be changed at all; hoping to change it is probably a vain wish. In fact, there is no reason why international issues should be determined solely by one-sided national policies. Moreover, under the Japanese political system, there are only policies for which the cabinet is solely responsible. The fact that policies are inherited and continued by countless generations of cabinets is only that each generation of cabinet inherits and continues them as policies, and there is no such thing as a national policy; calling its policies an unchanging national policy is only the self-promotion of the cabinet authorities, and they cannot bind the subsequent prime minister with policies, therefore, let alone that China's war of resistance will surely win, just continue the war of resistance, then as for Japan's repentance, it is not a vain wish after all. But from the perspective of responsibility in the Japanese political system, changing its attitude and changing its policies cannot be expected from the Yonai cabinet.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Military's Arrogance: Refusal to Compromise with Political Parties; Obsessed with Totalitarianism, Determined to Act Recklessly; Muto's Declaration Causes National Shock</h3>
<p>Tokyo:  Political figures seem greatly disturbed by some of the strong remarks made in the Lower House by the current Director of the Army Ministry's Military Affairs Bureau, Major General Muto.  Muto stated that if a political party in Japan only knows how to promote the interests of its members with all its might, seemingly forgetting the nation's system, and insists on not reconsidering its attitude, then it should be dissolved immediately.  Generally, people believe that this statement was aimed at the recent attitude of the Minseito party toward Saito.  The "Nichinichi Shimbun" stated that Muto's speech was "a historically significant declaration" because what it advocated represents the military's uncompromising attitude toward political parties and the Diet.  The "Miyako Shimbun" believes that Muto's views represent not only the military but also the people of the entire nation.  According to the "Nichinichi Shimbun," Muto's remarks in the Lower House represented Army Minister Hata Shunroku's explanation, in response to a question from a certain Diet member, of the military's views on (1) the current social system, (2) military intervention in political and economic affairs, and (3) the concept of cooperation between the party, government, and military.  Muto's original response was as follows:  To overcome the crisis Japan is facing, we must have a common standard principle.  As former Army Minister General Terauchi stated during his tenure, all forms of liberalism based on individualism must be set aside to cope with the current international relations.  Looking at the current international situation, almost every country is adopting nationalism and its concepts with the aim of national security.  Regarding economic matters, the policies followed by many countries are also based on the theory of imperialism.  Some countries are even adopting so-called group economics policies.  He believes that even in the economic warfare of the coming years, we must fight for the interests of the nation and put personal interests aside.  Japan is currently facing a crisis, so the people must do their utmost to overcome it smoothly.  In foreign countries, this ideology is called totalitarianism.  If political parties place too much emphasis on internal strategies and the achievement of selfishness and individual desires, they cannot be tolerated.  If officials place too much emphasis on personal and self-centered policies, they must also be strongly urged to reflect.  If the general public perceives any aspect of the military's attitude or opinions as arrogant, he believes the military should immediately correct it.  If any political party still has internal struggles and abuses internal policies, it should be reformed immediately, or else he believes it must be destroyed by legal means.  As for the frequently discussed military intervention in politics, he believes that when Japan is at war, the will of the military and politicians must be completely unified.  If there is a general who is also a great politician, then there will be no problem.  But in the current national structure, generals who command the army cannot simultaneously handle political affairs.  If politicians can fully understand the military's will and concepts, then the military can concentrate its energy on military matters.  However, in reality, this situation is extremely unlikely.  Therefore, the military must make various demands on politicians regarding the conduct of the war in China.  If it is thought that the military's demands are too strong, he hopes that all political and official figures will not hesitate to express their opinions frankly.  In this way, mutual understanding can be promoted.  If it is said that the military is too tough, he may reply that politicians are too weak.  In short, he earnestly hopes that we can recognize Japan's mission and strive to exchange opinions honestly and harmonize the strategies of war and politics. (Reuter's dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Creation of Puppet Regimes in China: Britain Resolves Not to Recognize Them; No Fundamental Change in Far East Policy</h3>
<p>London: According to reliable sources today, when Wang Jingwei's "New Central Government of China" is established in Nanjing, the British government will clearly inform Japan that Britain still regards the National Government in Chongqing as the only legitimate government of China.  At the same time, the British memorandum will make it clear that in the near future, Britain's attitude will not change. (Associated Press dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>New York: The "New York Daily News" published an article today stating that the new "Nanjing Government" headed by Jingwei can only exist under the support of Japanese bayonets.  Therefore, the final chapter of Wang Jingwei's history can be written by the United States.  A serious blow that the United States can inflict on Japan's invasion of China is to implement an embargo on Japan. (Associated Press dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>Soviet "Pravda" Commentary: The Last Act in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Moscow Dispatch. "Pravda" published a lengthy editorial entitled "The Last Act in Nanjing," stating that people like Wang gathered in Nanjing under the orders of the Japanese military to hold a meeting. What is the purpose of the Japanese warlords intensifying the movement to establish a government? It is that the Japanese warlords' position in the country is becoming increasingly shaky, and Wang and others are cheering them on in the last act in Nanjing as a tool to cover up their internally weakening situation. The Japanese military has not been able to gain widespread support in the occupied areas, and the Japanese people also know this very well. The Economic Department of the Asia Development Board stated that Japan has not been able to gain acceptance for the military currency circulating in the occupied areas, and the Chinese people uniformly refuse to accept it. The Chinese people have been successfully trained in the war and will continue to strive for the country with redoubled efforts, displaying their traditional spirit of calmness and bravery, and will not be subject to any threats or inducements.

<h3>Peiping City: Preparing for a Change of Flags</h3>
<p>Peiping: It is heard that the city police bureau has notified all shops to prepare the Blue Sky White Sun flags to be hung on April 1 when the "New Central Government" is established in Nanjing. These flags are similar to those used in Chongqing, except that there is a small triangular flag at the top with the red words "Anti-Communism and Peace" on it. Celebrations for the establishment of the "New Regime" in Peiping and Tianjin are now ready. According to Chinese sources, at that time, Peiping city will be plastered with leaflets, archways will be erected in all thoroughfares, and mass celebrations will be held. Tianjin will also celebrate for three days, and the celebration program includes lantern shows, a mass celebration meeting in the "Municipal Government" hall, the posting of leaflets throughout the city, and the reception of foreign consuls. (Reuter's dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Peiping: After Wang Kemin returned from Nanjing, he will convene a meeting to report on the proceedings of the Central Political Conference and important events concerning the North China Political Affairs Commission. It is heard that the Peiping "Provisional Government" is scheduled to formally announce its dissolution on March 29, and the "North China Political Affairs Commission" will be established on April 1. The joint Peiping office of the "Provisional" and "Restoration" governments was officially dissolved on the 22nd of this month. Direct telephone and radio communication between Peiping and Nanjing will be restored soon. The Peiping Radio Bureau started operations on the 22nd of this month, and the telephone bureau will also start operations in April. (Reuter's dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Peiping: Wang Kemin recently made a statement to the press, stating that matters such as preventing floods in the Yellow River and revising the Chinese medical dictionary will be handled by the "New Central Government." As for the important issues discussed at the recent "Central Political Conference," it is not convenient to report them one by one to avoid causing misunderstandings. As for the "New People's Society," it is a popular organization and not a political organ. Regarding the problem of food shortage in North China, Central China is preparing to transport 7,000 tons of rice to Peiping, but due to transportation difficulties, only 700 tons have been transported. In North China, coal should be transported to Central China in exchange. Regarding the merger of the armies of North and Central China, apart from the 15,000-strong security force here, there are no other armies. The "Central Political Conference" also did not discuss military issues. After the dissolution of the "Provisional Government," the policies implemented in North China will follow the "New Central Government." Regarding diplomatic issues, the "Central Political Conference" also did not submit them for discussion. In short, after the establishment of the "New Central Government," the personnel of the North China Political Affairs Commission will not undergo any changes. As for whether the anti-British movement will continue to exist after the opening of the committee, this is a popular movement and not instigated by the authorities, so it is not convenient to answer this question.

<h3>Japan's Economic Organization Does Not Intend to Follow in Germany's Footsteps; Response of the Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry to a Diet Member's Question</h3>
<p>Tokyo: At a meeting of the House of Representatives Budget Committee yesterday, Minister of Commerce and Industry Fujiwara replied to a question from a Diet member, saying that it is not appropriate to make drastic changes to Japan's economic organization. It is not appropriate in the current emergency period. The essence of the Diet member's argument is to completely reorganize our country's economic organization in the same way as the Nazi Party's German system and implement restrictions on consumption throughout the country to cope with the current difficulties. It is known that this kind of controlled economy only saw its implementation after a period of three years even in Germany. In our country, the number of large industries is small, the medium-sized industries with capital of around 500,000 yen, and the small-scale industries with capital of less than 10,000 yen are everywhere. These smaller industries are the main foundation of Japan's production industry. The difference between Japan's economic organization and Germany is also here. Japan has adopted the liberal economic policies pursued by Britain and the United States for many years. Even in wartime, this idea has not wavered. Although there are many complaints in some areas, the government is also deeply aware of them. However, the fault does not lie with the government. The crux of the matter is that the people of the whole country have not yet fully accepted the controlled economy. If we rashly follow in the footsteps of Nazism, it will inevitably cause great chaos. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<h3>Tensions in the Pacific Increase Daily; US Navy Demonstrates its Power; Spring Exercises to Extend to the Philippines; Fortifications on Various Islands Being Intensified</h3>
<p>Honolulu: Authoritative sources today believe that the US fleet's spring exercise program will have four more important points than in recent years: (1) The First Fleet problem, which will for the first time see a powerful patrol fleet depart from Hawaii, where 30 warships are currently stationed. (2) The first exercise area will extend west of the international dateline, meridian 180 degrees. (3) For the first time, the Pacific will be the hypothetical battlefield. (4) This is the first exercise since the outbreak of the European War, and will apply a variety of new tactics and weapons. The navies of Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan have all entered a state of wartime, so this year's US fleet's demonstration of power in the Pacific has a different kind of important significance. This year's exercise is the ninth exercise on the Hawaiian and Alaskan triangular defense area. The previous eight were in 1920, 1925, 1928, 1932, 1933, 1936, 1937, and 1938. Last year, it was held in the Atlantic and the Caribbean Islands. The Navy Department is currently completing its Pacific deployment, including the extremely large cost of fortifications in the Midway Island, Johnston Island, and Palmyra Island areas. On Midway Island, 1,400 miles northwest of Honolulu, the US engineering department has dispatched 350 engineers to guide the completion of the $1,878,000 river and harbor project by the end of this year. This month, the Navy Department will also send 80 advance personnel to the island to prepare for the establishment of a $4 million advanced air force base, which must be completed in at least one year. Johnston Island, located 717 miles southwest of Honolulu, has been gradually completed since November last year. The island now has a large number of work guidance personnel handling dredging projects. The Palmyra Islands, located 960 miles south of Honolulu, are also completing a $1 million air force base. The Kanikee Bay air force base is also under construction, which faces Pearl Harbor's Koolau Range. Most of these engineering plans will not be available for use during this year's major exercise. It is heard that if the enemy attacks Honolulu from the west of Midway Island in the future, Johnston Island and Palmyra Island can serve as "outposts." The garrisons defending the two islands can threaten enemy aircraft with the latest anti-aircraft guns. Pearl Harbor's 80 reconnaissance aircraft are also part of the defense force. This exercise will involve 350 aircraft, 10 battleships, 10 heavy cruisers, 12 light cruisers, 50 to 60 destroyers, 3 aircraft carriers, 20 submarines, and other warships. The Hawaiian fleet, led by Rear Admiral Andrews, has 9 heavy cruisers, 1 light cruiser, 20 destroyers, and many other small warships. In addition, there are the Pearl Harbor Fleet, air force reconnaissance aircraft, 14 submarines, and 9 warships of the mine squadron. This military force is particularly noteworthy. The Hawaiian garrison is of great help to the main fleet and can conduct guerilla warfare independently. Officials have not announced the possibility of the exercise extending west to the Philippine Islands. Recently, the Navy Department dispatched 14 bombers to the Philippines for neutral reconnaissance. The area currently has 6 new submarines and 13 destroyers, which are currently traveling with the cruisers "Augusta" and "Marblehead." These warships may join this exercise.

<h3>President Quezon's Speech on the Status of the Philippines: Said It Is Still Unable to Defend Itself</h3>
<p>Manila: Philippine President Quezon said in a speech at the Philippine Normal School today that the Philippines cannot defend itself by its own strength. "If the Philippines is attacked, it cannot but be conquered." However, he still advocates Philippine independence because "our current status cannot be maintained, because the current Philippines does not have full power to determine its national life." "If the Philippines could enjoy full power to determine its national life," he would be very willing for the Philippines to remain under the American flag, but the current trade relations between the United States and the Philippines are extremely unfavorable to the Philippines. For example, the current Philippines "does not have the power to conclude commercial treaties with other countries, and we do not have the power to levy taxes on American goods. We cannot reduce tariffs on foreign goods without first obtaining the consent of Washington. I ask, with such heavy restrictions, how can the Philippines adjust its national life?" When talking about foreign aggression, Quezon said that the Philippines would not be attacked by other countries under the American flag, because "unless provoked first, no country is willing to attack the United States, and the same is true of the United States. Unless provoked by other countries first, it will never attack other countries. Therefore, the Philippines can survive in its current state." (Associated Press dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>The 75th Japanese Diet Ended Yesterday; Total Budget of 16 Billion Yen; Will Issue Bonds and Increase Taxes to Make Up the Deficit</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Tokyo dispatch. The 75th Japanese Diet ended today. A total of 110 bills were submitted, and 108 were passed. The House of Peers is scheduled to hold the closing ceremony tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>The Diet passed the race improvement bill. Although it had been submitted once in previous sessions, it was ultimately shelved. The resolution passed by the House of Representatives stated that the average life expectancy of the Japanese people is shorter than the average life expectancy of the general civilized people of the East. The high infant mortality rate and inadequate prevention of lung disease are the main reasons. The government should increase the number of mountain and seaside sanatoriums to prevent lung disease. Furthermore, the prevalence of venereal disease today is mostly due to the people's lack of self-control and inadequate prevention. The government should strengthen the prevention of this social disease. The resolution of the House of Peers also urged the government to start researching prevention methods. (Dispatch on the 25th)</p>

The above three items are all under the ordinary budget, totaling 6,097,331,000 yen. The special military budget and the military budget arising from the "China Incident" total 4,460,000,000 yen. The ordinary and special budgets total 10,557,331,000 yen. If the colonial budget and the budget for various enterprises run by the government are added, the total amount reaches 16 billion yen. The government plans to issue 6 billion yen in public bonds from the next fiscal year (April 1 is the beginning of the next fiscal year) to make up for the shortfall in tax revenue.

Rice wine, Japanese gin, and fruit wine will be reduced in price by 10% to 15%. (Dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Yonai's Statement</h3>
<p>Tokyo: At the end of the 75th Japanese Diet, Prime Minister Yonai made the following statement on the night of the 26th: "The 75th Japanese Diet was extended for two days and ended today. This Diet was convened at a very important time when a new central government was established in China and a new turning point was made for the unified handling of the China Incident. The fundamental meaning of the China Incident is becoming clearer through sincere discussions in the Diet, which strongly reflects the belief and determination of the 100 million people as one, which is very gratifying. With the handling of the incident as the center, the Japanese government aims to enrich military preparations, uplift the national spirit, expand economic power, ensure the wartime national life, strengthen national defense, and build a great enterprise for the reconstruction of East Asia. Therefore, it has submitted the necessary budget proposals and various laws for tax reform and many other important bills. As a result of repeated deliberations, the budget proposals and important bills were approved by both houses, which is a great celebration for the situation. The Japanese government will actively consider the effective and appropriate use of the budget proposals and laws that it has received the cooperation of this Diet to implement, and it plans to strengthen the wartime system in all aspects at this time to thoroughly achieve the purpose of handling the incident and live up to the high expectations of the people of the whole country. Now, as the incident progresses, Japan's responsibilities are becoming heavier and greater. I am determined to advance with all my strength based on the firm and unshakeable national opinion and with the enthusiastic cooperation of the people, following the established policy and building a "New Order in East Asia."

<h3>After Welles Returns to the US, Roosevelt Will Issue a Declaration: Explaining the Significance and Gains of This Trip</h3>
<p>New York – Well-informed sources here have recently stated that as soon as Under Secretary of State Welles returns to Washington, President Roosevelt will issue a declaration explaining the significance and gains of the Under Secretary's visit to Europe, thereby rendering any attempt by a certain party to induce the United States to participate in a peace offensive completely ineffective. It is reported that Under Secretary Welles is already on his way back to the country and is expected to return to Washington on the 28th of this month. Rumors that he is returning with a peace plan have been strongly denied by the White House in the past week. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>US's Newest Aircraft Supplied to Britain and France</h3>
<p>Washington – News from here today states that the leaders of the US Army, Navy, and Air Force held a joint meeting yesterday and decided to sell five to six hundred new aircraft (originally built for the US Army and Navy) to Britain and France. Those attending the joint meeting included Secretary of War Woodring, Secretary of the Navy Edison, Air Force Commander Major General Arnold, and Army Chief of Staff General Marshall. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Washington – The US government has drafted principles for selling aircraft to the Allied countries, which will be reported to the House Military Affairs Committee by Secretary of War Woodring. According to reliable sources, US aircraft factories will sell new aircraft to the Allied countries, and experimental models can also be sold, but these new aircraft must be replaced by more efficient aircraft. The countries purchasing these aircraft must report on the performance of these aircraft in combat. President Roosevelt believes that selling aircraft to the Allied countries is very beneficial to the US aircraft industry. Not only can production efficiency be increased, but also the experience of air combat in various countries can be utilized, and various types of aircraft can avoid the loss of being discarded and unused. It is said that the United States has decided to sell 500 to 700 new aircraft to the Allied countries. (Haitong dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Two Major British Mail Ships Leave the US for Australia: To Be Converted into Troop Transports</h3>
<p>Panama – The British Cunard Company's large mail ship "Mauretania" anchored in Cristobal Bay last night and will be converted into a troop transport within days. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Panama – The British mail ship "Mauretania" is scheduled to arrive in Cristobal last night, then pass through the Panama Canal to Balboa. The Panama Canal Zone authorities dispatched a special guard to protect the giant ship to prevent sabotage and strictly kept the news of the ship's passage through the canal secret and did not announce it. It is reported that the "Mauretania" left New York last week, and soon after, the British "Queen Mary" also left the port. It is widely believed that both ships are heading to Halifax to be armed and then sail to Australia to transport troops. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>The United States Should Purchase British and French Islands: Building a Strong American Defense Line – The New York Daily News's Proposal</h3>
<p>New York – One of the largest newspapers in the United States, "The New York Daily News," declared that the United States should purchase the British and French territories along the Caribbean Sea. The newspaper published a map pointing out that the area of the Caribbean Sea, Central America, and the Panama Canal can be divided into two semicircles, one from Florida to British Guiana and the other from the equator to Mexico. This is America's "Maginot Line," and the existence of any foreign naval base is not allowed. (Haitong dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Spies Active in Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo – The famous Japanese publication "Yubin" magazine previously initiated a call for police chiefs from various districts of Tokyo to hold an informal round table meeting to solicit the opinions of the police authorities on the question of what attitude the general public should take in this extraordinary period. The magazine has recently published the results, stating that the discussion at the round table meeting focused on how to prevent the increasingly rampant espionage activities in Japan. The police chief of Itabashi Ward advocated that the motto "Don't Ask Too Much" should be the guiding principle for the general public. He said, "The best way for the general public to deal with espionage activities is not to meddle in other people's business. This is more important than the various orders issued by the government." Aoki, the head of the Second Section of the Intelligence Department of the Tokyo Central Police Station, advocated taking "Don't Talk Too Much" as a lesson. It is said that there are currently a large number of spies in Japan who are working for the Chinese National Government. These people are not limited to Chinese people; even Japanese and foreigners are also involved. Therefore, we must take appropriate precautions. The method is that all citizens should know what issues are prohibited from discussion. All matters related to army deployment, division organization, armament situation, and mobilization plans should be avoided in conversations. It must be known that one of the important reasons why the government is so secretive about national plans and does not announce them to the public is to prevent spies from taking the opportunity to inquire. If the public engages in inquiring about news everywhere, they can only obtain false news and rumors. The heart of curiosity is the root of all rumors." (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Number of Japanese Living in China Increases Year by Year</h3>
<p>Tokyo – According to statistics released by the East Asia Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, since the outbreak of the China Incident, the number of Japanese residents (including Koreans and Taiwanese) residing in various parts of China has increased sharply. The statistics are as follows: In July 1937, the distribution of Japanese residents in China was 43,107 in North China, 29,479 in Central China, and 14,336 in South China, totaling no more than 86,922. By January of this year, there were 119,162 Japanese residents in North China, 94,960 in Central China, and 21,611 in South China, totaling 345,733, which is more than four times the previous number.

<h3>Female Aviator Li Xiaqing Prepares for Long-Distance Flight: Raising Funds to Aid Chinese Refugees</h3>
<p>Washington – Chinese young female aviator Ms. Li Xiaqing will soon leave the United States for a 25,000-mile flight to South America and the West Indies to raise funds to aid Chinese refugees. Ms. Li had previously made a 10,000-mile similar flight in the United States to raise funds for her country's war expenses. Ms. Li graduated from the Boeing Aviation School in California in 1935 and is the only Chinese member of the American Flying Club. All of its members are pilots who have escaped from aircraft with parachutes in times of crisis. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Washington – The US Department of Commerce reported yesterday that in 1939, US organizations donated US$40 million to aid refugees in Europe and Asia.

Japan also received US$2.5 million in relief funds. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>The US Actively Implements Shipbuilding Plan: A Great Merchant Fleet to Be Completed in Ten Years</h3>
<p>Washington – According to news from here, since the outbreak of the European war, no less than 114 US ships have been sold to foreign countries, the smallest being wooden sailing ships sold to Canada, and the largest being 15,000-ton mail ships purchased by the Netherlands. This situation seems to contradict President Roosevelt's repeated statements that the United States must build a great merchant fleet. In fact, most of the money obtained from selling old ships at wartime high prices in the United States has been used for the construction of new ships. According to the current plan, 50 new ships will be built each year for a period of ten years. Currently, the mail ship "America" and 39 cargo ships worth £4 million have been launched, and 141 ships are under construction. However, most of the newly built ships may be temporarily shelved during the war because the Neutrality Act prohibits US ships from entering war zones. It is reported that when the First World War broke out in 1914, the United States had only 92 ships of more than 2,000 tons. Due to the large amount of cargo and the small number of ships, all docks were filled with goods waiting to be transported. When the current war began, the United States had 335 ships of more than 2,000 tons, but due to the restrictions of the Neutrality Act, it could not fully utilize wartime cargo transportation.

<h3>Swedish Prime Minister Explains Foreign Policy: Preparing to Strengthen Cooperation with Finland and Norway</h3>
<p>Stockholm – Prime Minister Hansson delivered a speech today explaining Sweden's current foreign policy, stating that, "Our country is prepared to sincerely study the issue of strengthening cooperation with other Nordic countries, but will not accept any concrete restrictions as a result. It is rumored that after the peace between the Soviet Union and Finland, Finland, Norway, and Sweden intend to conclude a treaty of defensive alliance. In fact, if such a treaty were to be concluded, it would cause the most serious consequences and would not be appropriate. As for our country's policy regarding the war between Finland and the Soviet Union, although the foreign side has criticized it a lot, the world should know the reason why we refused the passage of British and French troops through our country to Finland. The real intention was to avoid our country's territory from becoming a European battlefield. In short, the government and people of our country are unanimous in strictly adhering to neutrality. At the same time, we have provided Finland with various non-military assistance. Asking ourselves from the bottom of our hearts, we have already been able to confess without shame."

<h3>Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki's Mission to Italy is Significant: Met with Mussolini Yesterday</h3>
<p>London – According to Hungarian capital wireless telegraph, the Hungarian government's official newspaper admits that discussions on the Soviet Union's provision of guarantees to the countries of Southeastern Europe are still ongoing. The newspaper commented on Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki's talks in Rome, saying that the Soviet guarantee was indeed discussed, and the impact of German, Soviet, and Italian cooperation in Southeastern Europe was also discussed. However, Italy has no reason to act rashly. Italy's policy is based on the principle of prudence, so Italy is in a position to wait and see at will. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Rome – Since Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki arrived in Rome, he has been unable to meet with the Italian King because he is not in the capital. Yesterday, he telegraphed to San Rossore to convey the greetings of Hungarian Regent Horthy. Today, he received a reply from the King, expressing his gratitude. (Haitong dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Rome – After Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki met with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano yesterday, the following official report was released, declaring that Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki visited Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano yesterday and held a long and pleasant conversation. Teleki is scheduled to go to the Venezia Palace today to meet with Prime Minister Mussolini. (Haitong dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Budapest – Prime Minister Teleki is now on a visit to Rome and is scheduled to hold talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini tomorrow and meet with Pope Pius XII on the 27th of this month. Political circles here are paying close attention to the Prime Minister's visit. It is reported that since the heads of Germany and Italy met at the Brenner Pass a few days ago, the Hungarian government has "felt uneasy" about the movements in Rome. The further cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union and the establishment of an understanding between Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union in the Balkans and the Danube River region are not welcome in Hungary. Both Germany and Italy have advised Hungary that its territorial claims against Romania (referring to the province of Transylvania) should be postponed until after the war. This has also made Hungary unhappy. Political circles here say that if Italy cooperates with Germany and the Soviet Union, then Hungary "cannot ignore it." The goal of Prime Minister Teleki's visit to Rome is to inquire about Italy's intentions. In general, the Prime Minister must have discussed this point when he talked with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano today. Foreign Minister Ciano must also have explained Italy's policy in Southeastern Europe. At the same time, Prime Minister Teleki should also declare that maintaining the "status quo" of the Balkan Peninsula at present does not mean that Hungary has abandoned its territorial claims against Romania. The main points of the talks were nothing more than this. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Paris – Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki's visit to Rome is being commented on by diplomatic circles here, saying that the goal of Prime Minister Teleki's visit is to obtain a guarantee from Italy so that Hungary can be assisted by Italy if it is attacked by Germany or the Soviet Union in the future. Hungary's foreign policy has always relied on Italy, and Italy has also spoken out in support of Hungary's territorial claims. However, Hungary's acquisition of the Carpathian Ukraine province and parts of the Slovak state from the Czech Republic was only possible with the help of Germany. To this day, German troops have been stationed in the Slovak state, close to the Hungarian border. After occupying part of Poland, the Soviet Union also sent a large number of troops to station near the Hungarian border. Hungary feels uneasy, and rumors that Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union intend to divide spheres of influence in Central and Eastern Europe are rampant. Prime Minister Teleki made a trip to Rome in the hope of obtaining some comfort from the Italian side to alleviate his anxiety. However, whether this goal can be achieved is still unknown.

<h3>British Considering Norwegian Protest: Hoping to Reach a Compromise</h3>
<p>London – After the Norwegian government protested against British aircraft entering its airspace, diplomatic circles here believe that the country will also lodge a similar protest in the short term regarding the so-called activity of British warships in its territorial waters. If so, the British authorities will conduct an investigation to clarify whether there is any factual basis. Regarding this matter, all disputes actually arose because the British Navy decided to inspect German ships in the Skagerrak Bay (located at the mouth of the Baltic Sea) and along the coast of the Scandinavian Peninsula. Germany often uses this sea route to import contraband, and the British government can hardly turn a blind eye to it. Therefore, it decided to strictly implement inspections, but this does not mean that it does not respect Norway's neutral status. In other words, British warships will only inspect German ships when they are carrying military contraband and returning through the territorial waters of neutral countries. As for Germany's violation of international law, especially the fact that German warships have repeatedly used the territorial waters of neutral countries as a place to escape after attacking British and French merchant ships and merchant ships of neutral countries, Britain will never tolerate this for long. However, in any case, the British government will still consider the protest raised by the Norwegian government and hope to reach a compromise. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Stockholm – Regarding the large-character headlines published in the newspapers here, such as "The entire British destroyer fleet is active near the Norwegian coast," it can prove that the Swedish people are closely watching the recent developments at sea near Scandinavia. At present, although there are some individuals in Sweden who say that Germany's transport of pig iron through Norwegian territorial waters must be stopped, the general sentiment is very sympathetic to the Norwegian fleet.

<h3>Denmark Bans the Sale of Luxury Goods</h3>

<h3>No British Ships Sunk in One Week</h3>
<p>London – The Admiralty announced today that for the week ending March 24 (Sunday), no British or Allied ships were sunk. This is the first time since the start of the war. On the other hand, two German ships were sunk by British submarines near the coast outside Danish territorial waters. The ship names are Hitterxing (4,947 tons) and Stans (2,189 tons). The former was torpedoed on March 21 in Kattegat off the east coast of Denmark. The latter was reportedly seen by two British submarines leaving a Danish port, who signaled it to stop and fired three warning shots. However, the ship still did not stop, so the fourth shot hit the ship's body, injuring its second mate and servant. British sailors immediately boarded the ship, captured its captain, and ordered all sailors to leave the ship within 15 minutes. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>

Once more are built, they can be officially used. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Air Service Established Between the Dutch Capital and Berlin: Daily Round Trip Agreed to Use German Aircraft</h3>
<p>The Hague – Regarding the establishment of a regular air service between the Dutch capital and Berlin, the German government recently reached an agreement with the Dutch authorities, deciding to make one round trip each day, using only German commercial aircraft and piloted by German pilots. The Dutch authorities also allow German diplomats and envoys to travel between Germany and the Netherlands on this air service. The aircraft used by Germany are the B-6 type manufactured by the Junkers factory. Its style and route must be predetermined, and the flight personnel must also be designated. If there are any changes, the Dutch government must be consulted in advance. A German aircraft of another type had previously traveled on the route but immediately turned back midway to avoid being shot down by the Dutch anti-aircraft artillery. Observers here recently commented that German aircraft flying back and forth between Germany and the Netherlands every day are sufficient to provide weather information to Germany, which is of great importance to the country's bombing of the British coast. In addition, Germany had negotiated with Belgium, requesting that the air service between the capitals of Germany and Belgium be entirely German aircraft, but it was firmly rejected by the Belgian government.

<h3>French Reynaud Cabinet Unlikely to Last: Premier to Offer Resignation Before Senate Meeting</h3>
<p>Geneva - According to indirect news from Paris, the new French Reynaud cabinet will offer its resignation or be reorganized no later than April 9.

Political figures in Paris have pointed out that Reynaud's speech in the Senate at the end of last month aroused a poor impression in that body. Reynaud's declaration in the Chamber of Deputies recently did not improve the Senate's impression, so it is believed that the cabinet may offer its resignation or be reorganized when the Senate meets on the ninth of next month.

<h3>Eight Western Employees Dismissed: Shanghai Municipal Council Implements Austerity Measures: This Year's Revenue and Expenditure Expected to Balance; Police and Other Departments Will Also Continue to Reduce Staff</h3>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council's dismissal of foreign employees, the authorities have remained silent, keeping it a secret. According to investigations, the first batch of those dismissed totals eight people, all of whom are employees of the Works Department. It is said that most of these eight are qualified to receive subsidies from the Council, with a small number potentially receiving subsidies equivalent to one month's salary per year. However, according to Mr. Fessenden, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, after the Council dismisses these eight employees, they will not be replaced by others, as the Council's goal is not to replace the old with the new, but to save on salaries.</p>
<p>Brief Biographies of the Eight Dismissed Western Employees</p>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council would soon be dismissing Western employees from several departments. It has now been learned that the dismissal of eight Western employees from the Works Department has begun. It is said that some of them will definitely receive pensions, while those who have served for less than fifteen years will receive several months' severance pay. It is also said that the police and other departments will also reduce staff. Western employees in that department who have served for thirteen years without any promotion opportunities may be dismissed to allow for recruitment within the city, with salaries paid in legal tender. According to investigations, the eight people dismissed from the Works Department are: (1) Barrington, who has been a road engineering surveyor for twelve years and will receive twelve months' salary; (2) Vambero, who has been a land surveyor in the Land Office for seven years and will receive seven months' salary; (3) Hawkins, an engineer in the Roads Department, has recently submitted his resignation and will receive a pension; (4) Jenson, who has served in the Property Office for more than twenty years and will receive a pension; (5) Kerr, a horticulture expert, has worked in the Parks and Open Spaces Department for sixteen years and may receive a pension. It is said that his position will be taken over by a Chinese or Japanese person; (6) Schwiersky, who has served in construction for twelve years and will receive twelve months' salary; (7) Thomas, who has served in the Building Department for twenty years and is said to be eligible for a pension; (8) White, a Permata engineer, has served in the Electrical Engineering Department for twelve years and will receive a similar number of months' salary.</p>
<p>This Year's Revenue and Expenditure Sufficient to Offset</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's preliminary budget for this year's extraordinary revenue and expenditure was reviewed by the Finance Committee of the Council at a meeting on the 18th of this month. The Director of Finance presented the committee with the preliminary budget for this year's extraordinary revenue and expenditure (temporary). The results were as follows: (Expenditure) The deficit carried over from the previous year amounted to $2,970,530. Construction projects and the purchase of machinery and equipment approved by the relevant committees totaled $1,231,500. The breakdown is as follows: (1) Bunding $10,000; (2) Drains $95,000; (3) Sewers $20,000; (4) Wharves $100; (5) Land requisition $10,000; (6) Buildings $179,000; (7) Road construction $700,000; (8) Purchase of machinery and equipment $217,300. In order to cope with various expenses for unforeseen events, a military blanket fee of $650,000 is listed under the "Emergency Measures" item. In addition, $950,000 will be set aside for the staff pension fund as usual this year. The deposit for debt principal amounts to $5,484,320, including the repayment of fixed deposits and temporary loans in gold yuan (paid quarterly, $25,000 USD each time), etc. In addition, $89,600 can be deducted from the income side under the construction item for educational expenses. (Revenue) This year's sale of surplus Council property and miscellaneous income is estimated to be $980,000. The income from the recent sale of Council property to the Italian government accounts for a large portion of the above total. Revenue from the issuance of public bonds and other sources is estimated at around $16 million, of which $12 million will be used for the financial arrangements recently made with various banks, and the remainder will be used to offset the deficit carried over from the previous year and to increase investment in the pension fund. After offsetting revenue and expenditure, it is expected that there will be a surplus of $30,770, which will be transferred to the next year. The above budget has been submitted by the Finance Committee to the Board of Directors for approval.</p>
<p>General Description of This Year's Tax Collection</p>
<p>(1) Land tax: From January 1 this year, it will be levied at 9 per mille of the value of the land within the Settlement. From July 10 until the next annual meeting of taxpayers, an additional surcharge of 50% will be added. This land tax is prepaid by the landlords every six months. (2) General rate: From April 1 this year, it will be levied at 18% of the estimated rental amount. From July 1 until the next annual meeting of taxpayers, an additional surcharge of 50% will be added. This general rate is prepaid by the residents quarterly.

From July 1 until the next annual meeting of taxpayers, an additional surcharge of 50% will be added. This house rate is prepaid by the residents quarterly. (4) License fees: The surcharge added to various license fees and other taxes before June 30 this year is 10%. From July 1 until the next annual meeting of taxpayers, the surcharge added will be 50%. The collection of the above taxes has been approved by the Council's Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Expanding Implementation of Staff Reduction Policy</p>
<p>In addition, it is reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council will continue to promote this staff reduction policy. The Council has now organized a special committee to specifically study the task of saving administrative expenses. Furthermore, the heads of all departments have received notifications from the Council, requesting that they make every effort to reduce administrative expenses within the possible range. This matter has been announced. It is hereby specifically clarified that there are many misunderstandings in the outside world regarding the timing of the committee's report. The statement in the Council's previous announcement that "the committee cannot report within this municipal year" refers to the municipal year ending April 17 this year, and not the entire year. Furthermore, the committee is expected to provide interim reports at any time within this year for review.</p>
<p>Last Year's Deficit Carried Over to This Year</p>
<p>On the 18th of this month, the Finance Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council held a regular meeting. The Director of Finance submitted a report on the actual situation of the Council's revenue and expenditure for the previous year's general expenses. The report stated that the deficit for the previous year's "Ordinary Category" expenses was initially listed as $5,836,102.35. After revising the calculation method for inventory, the above deficit could be reduced by $449,761.97. At the same time, $4,042,728.79 was transferred from the fund under the "Debt Suspense" item to offset the deficit. As a result, the deficit amount carried over from the previous year to this year's calculation was $1,343,611.59. As for the allocation of education expenses last year, the total amount only met 2% of the rate of contribution, so the amount of the deficit did not reach the estimated $30,150. The above report has been submitted by the Finance Committee to the Board of Directors for approval.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation on North Jiangxi Road</h3>
<p>On North Jiangxi Road in the northern part of the Suzhou Creek, the barbed wire erected by the Japanese has been moved and placed in the center of the road, making it inconvenient for pedestrians and vehicles. Near North Jiangxi Road and Qipu Road, manure carts block the road, and passersby often cover their noses. Furthermore, the number of Japanese soldiers patrolling that area has decreased recently, and the situation has become more relaxed. However, at the gaps at Wenzhenshi Road and Hainin Road, Japanese sentry soldiers are still stationed, even though the Japanese have announced the opening of Hongkou, and they continue to carry out strict inspections of residents entering and exiting.</p>

<p>Japanese Attempt to Increase Quota</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy stated yesterday (25th) while receiving journalists that as the number of Japanese residents and Japanese interests in the city have increased, the number of Japanese directors on the Shanghai Municipal Council should also be increased to be proportional to the increase in the number of Japanese taxpayers. When asked whether Japanese residents were dividing large properties into many small parts in order to increase Japanese voting rights, the spokesman replied that the British also did this.</p>
<h3>British United Cotton Mill Labor Strike: Negotiations Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>At the British United Cotton Mill in Yangshupu, after the workers demanded improved treatment, which was not accepted by the management, a go-slow strike has been going on for half a month. Through the mediation of Gao Yengen and Granby of the Police Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, labor and management held their fourth negotiation yesterday afternoon, the 26th. It is reported that the management expressed its opinions on the workers' newly proposed thirteen demands and five additional demands, item by item, based on the English translation, which lasted more than an hour. As a result, the management still stated that there may be discrepancies between the Chinese and English versions, which still need to be studied in detail. There was no concrete expression on the matters of rice subsidies, a 30% increase in wages, and subsidies for the labor union. It was stated that a meeting would still be needed before a decision could be made. Therefore, the workers have not yet resumed work.</p>
<h3>Changes in Earth Currents: Radio Communications Interrupted: Shanghai Unable to Send and Receive for a Long Time: Caused by Sunspots</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that United Press in New York said that sunspots occurred in the solar corona on the evening of the 24th to the morning of the 25th, causing changes in earth currents and interrupting worldwide radio communications. According to a reporter's inquiry with the city's radio company, Shanghai was unable to send and receive radio communications from midnight on the 24th to noon on the 25th. Although the situation improved slightly from 5:30 am to 7:30 am on the 25th, it then worsened again. Normal radio transmission and reception was not restored until noon. According to the United Press report, the US broadcasting network was forced to suspend operations several times at that time. The earth current changes were most severe east of the Mississippi River in the United States, gradually disappearing westward. The American Telephone and Telegraph Company stated that the severity of this earth current change was unseen since 1907. The measured earth current was 400 volts in Boston, 450 volts in Milwaukee, and 750 volts in St. Louis. Furthermore, Dr. Menzel, an astrophysicist at Harvard University, stated that electrical disturbances must originate from the Arctic. Sunspots have just completed their eleven-year cycle and reached their peak.</p>
<h3>Price Stabilization to be Implemented Concretely: French Concession Price Stabilization Committee Holds General Meeting: 3,300 Tons of Coal Dust Have Arrived</h3>
<p>The three sub-committees established by the French Concession Public Works Bureau Price Stabilization Committee have been working tirelessly on investigations since their establishment. Recently, each sub-committee has held several discussions and has drafted concrete plans for price stabilization, including: (1) Negotiating with the Japanese to issue food procurement permits; (2) Organizing procurement agencies in parks to control marketing; (3) The Kai Yuan Company will supply coal dust at cost, etc. The first and second points are currently being actively carried out by the authorities. As for the city's</p>
<p>Coal Dust Issue</p>
<p>According to officials from Kai Yuan Company yesterday, the company recently shipped 3,300 tons of third-grade coal dust from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai, entrusting the Coal Industry Association to supply it to the boiled water industry at a price of $50 per ton to provide relief. It is estimated that each boiled water store can be allocated two tons, which is expected to solve the coal shortage for boiled water stores in the short term. As for whether to continue to supply it in the future, it is currently being considered and will be decided based on various situations. It is now reported that the authorities of the two Concessions are maintaining constant contact and research on price stabilization measures in order to gradually implement the entire plan. The</p>
<p>Sub-Committee</p>
<p>has now scheduled a plenary meeting for tomorrow (the 28th) to discuss concrete implementation measures so that people can truly benefit and the principle of no harm to business can be maintained. As for the Japanese side, they have expressed their willingness to cooperate with the Concessions and relax their</p>
<p>Suburban</p>
<p>restrictions. In reality, the Japanese military has not taken any concrete measures, so this statement is just empty talk. The Japanese recently assured the Shanghai Municipal Council Price Stabilization Committee that they were willing to take</p>
<p>measures, but in reality they have not put them into practice. According to reports, the Japanese admitted that the heavy taxes levied on imports into Shanghai</p>
<p>for the first time. It is believed that most of the taxes are secretly handled by lower-level agencies. Therefore, they doubt whether a single order from the Japanese can take effect. If the Japanese are sincere in cooperating to suppress</p>
<p>prices, they should issue a</p>
<p>order and ensure that the order is effective, eliminating all fraud before it is possible.</p>
<h3>Kunming Parcels Accepted Today: Remittances to Shaoxing Limited to $30 Per Person Per Day</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration's military transport department makes every effort to clear and deliver mail and heavy parcels to various locations. However, due to the ongoing battles in various places, postal transport is difficult. Now that cargo transport on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway has been</p>
<p>resumed, parcels from Shanghai</p>
<p>Kunming will be accepted</p>
<p>starting today. Post and remittance services in the eastern Zhejiang war zone have also been restored. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Parcels Restored</p>
<p>Parcels destined to Kunming has been suspended earlier due to the bombing damage of Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. The Parcel Department of the Shanghai Postal Administration, recognizing the large number of parcels sent from Shanghai to Kunming and the severe impact on domestic sales of</p>
<p>goods, has conducted several consultations and reached an agreement. It has been</p>
<p>decided to resume acceptance starting today. Each piece will be temporarily limited to 20 kilograms, with a fee of $2.90 per kilogram. However, it will only be accepted for Kunming proper, and the field of Tian Hai will be forwarded. If transport is unobstructed, the Shanghai Post Office plans to transport large quantities.</p>
<p>Remittances Activated</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng She learned from the Shanghai Postal Administration that after Xiaoshan fell into the war zone, the eastern Zhejiang</p>
<p>situation became tense, and transport was busy, leading to postal transport being suspended. In addition to normal acceptance of express letters,</p>
<p>ordinary letters, express letters, and registration letters, the Shanghai Post Office temporarily suspended the acceptance and issuance of</p>
<p>parcels. This lasted for more than two months. In response to the requests of Zhejiang natives in Shanghai, the Bureau has decided to open remittance service to Zhuji, Shaoxing, Fengqiao, Paitou, Anchang, Ma'an, Wenjiayan, Keqiao, Dongguan,</p>
<p>Fangqiao, Sunduan, Baiguan, Songxia and other locations, limited to 30 yuan per person per day. The remittance fee for Shaoxing is 2 cents per yuan, while the remaining fees will be 3 cents.</p>

The procession will depart from the Central Funeral Home at 2:15 pm and</p>
<p>be buried at the Shanghai Municipal Council Cemetery on Jing'an Temple Road at 4 pm. It has also been learned that the reports in the newspapers the day before yesterday that the Central Government had allocated a condolence payment of 10,000 yuan were rumors. It is because Chairman Chiang had sent a telegram instructing the Judicial Yuan to grant generous condolences. However, the official order from the Judicial Yuan has not yet arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Passing of Tianxu Wosheng</h3>
<p>The writer Tianxu Wosheng, Mr. Chen Xuyuan, passed away on the 24th of this month at 10 o'clock. Mr. Chen made great contributions to both the literary and industrial fields, authoring over a hundred works. He left instructions for his children to compile and publish his complete works. The funeral was held yesterday at the World Funeral Home, with hundreds of mourners shedding tears in remembrance, considering it a great loss to the nation and society. (Continued from yesterday) Below is an account of a female obstetrician being called from the hospital to attend a birth. One afternoon at 7 p.m., the Youth Association's industrial section called, requesting an obstetrician to attend a birth. The expectant mother's family lived in just a quarter of a regular room. The room was originally divided into front and back sections, and the front section was further divided in the middle of the window, with a loft built above. The loft was then divided into four compartments using old furniture. The expectant mother's compartment contained a bed, a cupboard, and several chairs, all very dirty and crowded with people in soiled clothes. The air was stagnant, but not cold, and there was a stove for cooking, but it wasn't lit. Seeing this situation, the female obstetrician decided not to touch the expectant mother there, telling them that giving birth in such conditions would inevitably endanger the safety and health of both the baby and the mother, and that the mother and child might contract infectious diseases or even die. It was only when the female obstetrician was about to leave that the expectant mother and her husband finally agreed to go to the hospital. Then, the Mountain Fire Brigade ambulance transported the expectant mother to the hospital. Upon entering the delivery room, she gave birth to a healthy baby. Later, the female obstetrician told us that she was afraid the expectant mother would give birth in the ambulance, but even giving birth in the ambulance would have been better than at her home. Two days after the birth, the expectant mother insisted on going home because she already had four children, the eldest eleven years old and the youngest three, and no one could take care of the household chores. Her husband had to go out to work and had not arranged for neighbors or relatives to help with the household chores. Because the expectant mother had these difficulties and was in good health, no different from ordinary people, we allowed her to be discharged on the third day after delivery. She also said she really couldn't stand lying in bed any longer.</p>
<p>On March 5th of this year, a Sichuanese expectant mother (24 years old) came to the hospital by rickshaw. The baby had already been born, but the placenta had not yet been delivered. Both mother and child were well. After being wrapped in clothing, the baby cried loudly and was sent to the nursery. The expectant mother said that she had bled a lot before arriving at the hospital, but after the placenta was delivered, the bleeding was less. In any case, her condition did not require special treatment, and she was safely sent to the ward to rest. Her family, besides herself and her husband, also included two daughters, one eight years old and one five years old, who performed in the Sincere Company's playground. They performed every day from 1 p.m. to 8 p.m., and performed on stage from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. and from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., and after coming off stage, they often practiced the skills for the next performance. Her special skill was lying on her back and extending her legs, with five people standing on her, performing various patterns or singing, etc. On the night she gave birth, she still performed on stage, finishing at 8 p.m. Although she felt a little uncomfortable during the performance, she didn't pay much attention to it and tried her best to perform according to the scheduled program. She came off stage around 8 p.m. and then took a rickshaw to the hospital. At 8:30 p.m., she gave birth in the rickshaw. She and her husband each received a monthly salary of twenty yuan, with a deduction of one-quarter, so the two earned a total of thirty yuan, and the two children earned five or six yuan a month. She thought her work was easy, and after resting for a week, she was discharged from the hospital and returned to the stage again.</p>
<h3>Qian Zhuang Co., Ltd. - Remittance Bank New Organization of Qian Industry Supplementary Industry Regulations</h3>
<p>The local Qian industry association, through the initiation of financial magnates Pei Yunqing, Xia Xingfang, etc., has organized Jinyuan Qian Zhuang in the name and nature of a limited company, opening up a record of Qian industry planning and allocation that has never existed before. Regarding the matter of requesting to join the association, it has been resolved by the 102nd executive committee meeting, but there is a great need to supplement the industry regulations of the Qian industry. Therefore, a spring manager meeting was convened at 1 p.m. yesterday, concurrently opening the 108th executive committee of the third session and the Qian Industry Joint Reserve Committee meeting. More than 30 people attended, including the managers of various banks, Xu Wenqing, Qian Yuansheng, Liu Wuqiao, Shen Jingliang, etc. At the meeting, Chairman Ji Ming reported on the following matters: (1) The executive committee's resolution on the previous meeting tea and the discussion items on the reserve's various reports; (1) The various procedures to be prepared for the limited company to join the Qian Zhuang were resolved to be handled according to the usual membership procedures; (2) The application of various Qian Zhuang of the limited company to join the association was approved.</p>
<h3>Joint Supply from Various Factories - Coal Briquettes Sold at Fixed Price Starting Today - Limited to Two Jiao Per Person, Equivalent to Four Jin - Thirty Zones Established in the Two Concessions for Fixed Price Sale</h3>
<p>The second phase of the fixed-price sale of coal briquettes will begin today and is scheduled for ten days, ending on April 5th. A total of thirty locations have been established in the two concessions, an increase of two compared to the first phase. Sales will begin every day from 2 p.m. until supplies run out. Each person is limited to two jiao per purchase, equivalent to four jin. During the period, the police districts of the two concessions will send detectives to the various fixed-price sales locations to maintain order. All the fixed-price coal briquettes are supplied by Yitaixing, Nanyang, Guohua, Public, Huacheng Cuiji, Heji, Guanghua, Yuedong, Jinghua, Dongfang, and other factories, benefiting the common people, which is truly extraordinary. However, the common people deeply hope that the industry will increase the quantity sold at a fixed price per person each time. According to a report by a Xin Sheng She reporter, the distribution locations for the fixed-price coal briquettes are as follows:</p>
<p>Seventeen zones in the International Settlement, thirteen zones in the French Concession</p>
<h3>Imitating Signature - Fraudulently Receiving Large Sums of Money - Two Criminals Arrested and Original Stolen Goods Recovered</h3>
<p>Guangdong native Liang Shuhong (21 years old, residing at 528 Beijing Road) and Ouyang Hui (18 years old, residing at 6 Sanyi Lane, Jisi Feier Road) were previously employed at the German Weimao Foreign Firm at 264 Jiangxi Road. They were both dismissed from the firm last year. Ouyang Hui then transferred to the Meizuishi Foreign Firm, while Liang has been unemployed ever since. When Liang left the firm, he secretly obtained a piece of paper used for requisitioning checks. Recently, Liang and Ouyang conspired, and as a result, they used this paper to obtain a checkbook from the Dehua Bank on Jiangxi Road. Ouyang Hui was skilled at imitating the signature of the manager of Weimao Foreign Firm, so between the 1st and 14th of this month, he continuously forged the manager's signature of Weimao and fraudulently received 57,080 yuan in legal tender from the Dehua Bank. After the case occurred, Weimao Foreign Firm reported it to the General Inspectorate. As a result of the investigation by Chinese detective Song Yuanshan, it was learned that Liang and others were responsible. They then devised a method to first arrest Liang and then arrest Ouyang Hui. In Ouyang's possession, they recovered 50,356.3 yuan in original stolen legal tender. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Division of the Special First Court. Inspectorate lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the process, stating that the case was still under detailed investigation, so he requested permission for detention. Judge Feng Shide reviewed the report and ordered that both defendants be detained and the hearing be rescheduled.</p>
<h3>Customs Broker Runner - Embezzlement of Business Punished</h3>
<p>Wu Jingfu, a Ningbo native and runner for the Liyuan Customs Broker at 19 Fada Road, has recently been frequenting singing halls and dance halls, leading to insufficient income. As a result, since last winter, he has continuously embezzled 1,549 yuan in payments from customers such as Shilai, Hao Yuanchang, and Huamei, spending it all at the Hollywood gambling den. He also stayed overnight with a guide, Meng Lijun, on the upper floor of the Hongkou Dapaoche Motor Company. The manager of Liyuan Firm, Pei Chunsun, found out about this and immediately commissioned lawyer Huang Jiyuan to report it to the Inspectorate and arrest Wu, who was then escorted to the First Criminal Division of the Special Second Court for trial. Because Wu had contracted syphilis, he was sent to Guangci Hospital by the Inspectorate for treatment, so the hearing was repeatedly postponed. The hearing continued yesterday morning. Judge Liao sentenced Wu Jingfu to three months in prison and ordered him to return 1,549 yuan in national currency to the plaintiff.</p>

<h3>Japanese-Owned Yangzi Cold Storage Egg Factory - Major Fire Broke Out the Night Before Last - Flames Illuminated the Sky in the Dim Evening Light - Both Land and Water Fire Brigades Fully Mobilized - Huge Losses - Various Rumors About the Cause</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin West News reported that the Japanese-owned Tazi Cold Storage Egg Factory (formerly the Chinese-owned Maochang Egg Factory) at the northwest corner of Nanzun Road and Huangpu Road caught fire last night (the 25th), which was the fourth time in recent years. The Hongkou and Central Fire Brigades' fire engines, assisted by the Japanese Navy Marines' fire brigade, made every effort to extinguish the fire. The Customs fireboat Puji and the Public Settlement fireboat Fire Dragon were also dispatched to the scene, but did not draw water to extinguish the fire. The egg factory warehouse was a four-story building, mostly on the Nanzun Road side. The top floor and roof were heavily damaged by the fire. The fire once threatened the lower floors of the building and the neighboring warehouses. A portion of the cork stored on the top floor was destroyed, and the amount of goods damaged by water must have been huge. The Hongkou Fire Brigade heard the alarm and rushed to the scene with fire engines, which prevented the fire from spreading. The fire was brought under control forty minutes after the firefighters arrived, and they left after two hours and thirty-eight minutes of extinguishing.</p>
<p>The fire alarm was issued at 5:48 p.m. Passersby saw smoke and urgently called the fire brigade. The person ran to the intersection of Bielaohui Road and Huangpu Road, but unfortunately slipped and fell, shaking his brain, or perhaps suffering a stroke. He was later sent to the hospital by ambulance. The first to arrive was the Hongkou Fire Brigade's fire engine, followed by the Central Fire Brigade's firefighters and the Puji and Fire Dragon fireboats. In addition to one ambulance, the Central Fire Brigade's ambulance also arrived at the scene, drawing water from both Huangpu Road and Nanzun Road to extinguish the fire. A huge safety net was stretched out on Huangpu Road. At that time, thick smoke and flames burst through the roof, and white smoke filled the air. The Bund and both sides of the Huangpu River could be seen. As dusk approached, the flames illuminated the sky. The Japanese Navy Marines dispatched sailors wearing steel helmets, driving fire engines to the scene to assist the Public Settlement fire brigade in extinguishing the fire. Dozens of Japanese soldiers, wearing steel helmets and carrying bayonets, were around the burning buildings.</p>
<p>A cordon was set up to prevent passersby from approaching. Many Japanese military police and several Japanese consular police officers, some holding rifles, were also stationed on Huangpu Road and Wusong Road. Around 7 p.m., some fire engines were able to leave, and all the remaining vehicles returned after 8 p.m. According to the Continental News, the cause of the fire is still unknown and is currently being investigated by officials. However, informed sources believe that it may have been caused by a leak of ammonia stored in the warehouse. Some people suspect that it may have been an act of political arson.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Shop Clerk - Embezzled Funds and Fled - Apprehended in a Dance Hall</h3>
<p>Qiu Yuming, a Suzhou native (19 years old, residing at 19 Taihe Lane, Bairbu Road), was employed at the Santaixiang Cotton Cloth Shop established by Yan Zhongchuan at 12 Beijing Road 400 Lane. On the 21st of the month, Yan entrusted him with a check from the Siming Bank with a face value of 10,320 yuan to be deposited at the Tongrun Qian Zhuang on Tianjin Road. However, Qiu cashed the check and fled. On the afternoon of the 23rd, while Qiu was dancing in the Juelu Dance Hall on Yuqiaqing Road, he was apprehended by General Inspectorate Chinese detectives Yang Peisheng and Ren Fengwu, who found 120 yuan in legal tender on him. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Division of the Special First Court. Inspectorate lawyer Ru Baoyi requested permission for temporary detention pending investigation. After a brief interrogation by Judge Feng Shide, he ordered him to be detained pending a rescheduled hearing.</p>

<h3>Concealing Counterfeit Money Arrested - Confessed to Being Entrusted by Gambling Den Staff</h3>
<p>Lu Renyiqing, 54 years old, was found carrying a large amount of counterfeit money near 25th 4pm Robert Sheng Road, betel nut road. The Putuo Road patrol team found a roll of banknotes in his pocket, totaling 132 yuan and 88 cents, including ten 5-yuan counterfeit notes from the Bank of Communications and one 5-yuan note from the Farmers and Two Banks. He confessed that the counterfeit money had been given to him by his friend Xu Jintang, who worked at the gambling table in Caojiadu, and asked him to send it to the home of Song Zhaocheng, a returnee, at 3370 Hede Road. He did not know that there was fraudulent legal tender inside. The Chinese and Western police officers accompanied him to the address to arrest Song, but no counterfeit money was found. They were then taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Division of the Special First Court. Inspectorate lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the case and requested a postponement. The counterfeit money was presented for inspection. Defendant Yiqing claimed that the counterfeit banknotes belonged to Xu Jintang and that he did not know the truth, asking for leniency. Song Zhaocheng confessed that Xu Jintang was his nephew, and indeed worked at the gambling table in Caojiadu. On December 12th of last year, he borrowed 130 yuan from him, which he had not yet repaid. The rest of his confession was evasive. Judge Huang Risheng ordered them to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the investigation.</p>
<h3>Poisoning from Eating Puffer Fish - Five People Dead or Injured</h3>
<p>A Jiangbei people boat is moored in the Suzhou River at the Great King Temple on Xin Zha Road. Yesterday afternoon at 6 p.m., Ye Shuji (39 years old, from Jiangbei), the owner of the boat, bought several puffer fish at a nearby vegetable market and brought them back to the boat, ordering his wife, Liu, to cook them for dinner. Those who ate together included his younger brother, Xiaolaohan (18 years old), and his neighbors Wan Yu (23 years old) and Wan Cai (18 years old), as well as Liu, totaling five people. Unexpectedly, after eating their fill, they all suffered from abdominal pain and collapsed to the ground. People called the police and summoned an ambulance, which rushed them to Baolong Hospital for treatment. However, Ye Shuji was too deeply poisoned and died soon after. The lives of the others are also in grave danger.</p>
<h3>Child Bride - Husband Requests Dissolution of Marriage</h3>
<p>Sun Dingchen, 25 years old, a Jiangyin youth currently residing at 30 Huanzi Road in the French Concession, recently hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Special Second Court, requesting the dissolution of his marriage with his fiancee, Cao Donglin. According to reports, when the plaintiff was seven years old, his parents arranged for the defendant to come to his house as a child bride. When she reached seventeen, because he disagreed with the arranged marriage, he opposed his parents, but to no avail. He left home. After the war broke out, the defendant also left home without saying goodbye, and her whereabouts are unknown. Therefore, he requests permission to dissolve the marriage. The court reviewed the case and, as the defendant had been summoned repeatedly without appearing, ordered a debate to be held and announced that the case was clear. The judgment will be announced on the 30th of this month.</p>
<h3>This Saturday - International Grand Champion Race - First Prize Winner Can Receive - 100,000 Yuan - Commission Donation Approximately - 10,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The International Sports Association's annual race, held at the Shanghai Racecourse, has been running for four days, with races held on the 16th, 23rd, and 25th of this month. This Saturday is the last day. The results of the three days of racing have been exceptionally good. In view of the displacement of refugees, the association continues to follow the old practice of donating two percent of the total ticket sales from the exclusive winning position and lottery tickets in this race, and ten yuan from each grand champion ticket, with half of the total amount donated to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association and half donated to the Salvation Army, which is a very commendable initiative to benefit the spectators. Currently, the amount to be donated from the three days has reached more than 18,000 yuan in national currency, and the grand champion ticket proceeds have not yet been included. It is expected that the amount will be quite considerable. In addition to the Grand Champion Race to be held at the ninth race on Saturday, there will also be second, third, and fourth-place champion handicap races. The program is the best of the four days, and as the spring breeze is blowing and the feeling of spring is abundant, it is expected that participation will be even greater, and there will be a lot of excitement. It is heard that there are 30,000 Grand Champion tickets in total, with a first prize of 100,000 yuan. Each full ticket has eleven strips, totaling ten yuan in national currency, and each strip is one yuan. As the drawing date is only two or three days away, the number of purchasers has doubled.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Announces - Outline for the Implementation of National Education (2)</h3>
<p>Chapter 3: School Facilities</p>
<p>Article 9: The principle is to establish one national school per bao, called a certain bao national school. For a bao with a dense population and an area of less than four square li, or a natural unit of one village or one street that cannot be separated, two or three baos may jointly establish one school, called a certain bao joint national school. For a bao with an excessively vast area and scattered villages, the national school may have separate classes and set up mobile teaching classes in each village. Article 10: Each xiang (town) should set up a central school, called a certain xiang (town) central school, which is also responsible for guiding the national schools of each bao in the xiang (town). A bao that already has a central school within the xiang (town) or where each bao is less than three li from the central school will not set up a separate national school. The children and out-of-school people who should be enrolled will study at the central school. Article 11: Bao national schools and xiang (town) central schools should all set up elementary school departments and mass education departments. The elementary school department of a national school should complete a four-year elementary school as a principle, but in order to quickly popularize compulsory education, it may run classes that end in one or two years. The mass education department should run elementary adult classes and elementary women's classes as a principle. The elementary school department of a xiang (town) central school should run a six-year elementary school as a principle, and the mass education department should run advanced adult classes and advanced women's classes as a principle. Article 12: In places where education funding is developed, the principals of bao national schools and xiang (town) central schools should be appointed by the county government from personnel who meet the qualifications stipulated in Article 64 of the Revised Elementary School Regulations. Article 13: Xiang (town) central schools should have a specially appointed director of teaching, who, in addition to presiding over the teaching affairs of the school, should also assist the president in guiding all matters related to teaching in the national schools of each bao. Bao national schools should also increase the number of directors of teaching within the scope of possibility to preside over school affairs. Article 14: The elementary school departments of bao national schools and xiang (town) central schools should comply with the Revised Elementary School Regulations and relevant elementary school education laws and regulations. The mass education department should comply with the Revised Mass School Regulations and relevant mass education laws and regulations.</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Fundraising</p>
<p>Article 15: The funding for bao national schools should be based on the principle of self-fundraising by the bao. When there is a shortfall, it should be provided from the county and city funding items. Article 16: The bao national school should raise a considerable fund within a certain period of time for the purpose of expanding school facilities. The fundraising method will be determined separately. Article 17: The funding for xiang (town) central schools, the salaries of the principal and teachers, should be paid from the county and city funding items, and the office expenses and equipment expansion expenses should be raised locally and should refer to the bao fundraising method to raise sufficient funds. Article 18: The salaries of teachers in bao national schools should be at least twice the standard of personal living expenses such as food, clothing, and housing in the school's location. The principal should also be appropriately raised. The salaries of teachers in xiang (town) central schools should be the same as the principal of the bao national school as a principle, and the principal should also be appropriately raised. The allocation of county education funding and the fundraising of bao national school funds, and the salary expenditure part, should all follow this standard. Article 19: When the funding for counties and cities to establish national schools and central schools is insufficient, the province should provide appropriate subsidies from the province's funding and the funding allocated by the central government. Article 20: The funding for training teachers should be drawn from the province and city's funding and the funding allocated by the central government. Article 21: Provinces and cities with poor and other special circumstances may be given additional subsidies by the central government to promote national education.</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Teacher Training</p>
<p>Article 22: Before each province and city reorganizes the original elementary schools and independently established mass schools into central schools and national schools, they should convene personnel preparing to work as principals of central schools and national schools for short-term training of one to three months. Article 23: Each city should, within six months after the implementation of this outline, conduct a general registration and inspection of elementary school teachers and full-time teachers of mass schools in each county. Those who fail the inspection but whose academic ability is still competent may be given short-term training of three to six months as substitute teachers. Article 24: Each province and city should accurately count the number of teachers needed for the central schools and national schools in its jurisdiction, and formulate a plan for regional and phased teacher training in accordance with the teacher training methods promulgated by the ministry, and implement it after submitting it to the capital for approval. Article 25: Each province and city should train teachers in phases, with principals and teachers of central schools and principals of national schools being trained by normal schools and special normal departments as a principle, and teachers of national schools being trained by simple normal schools and simple normal departments as a principle.</p>
<p>Article 26: The chief personnel in charge of the various teacher training programs in Articles 22 and 23 above in each province and city shall be convened by the Ministry of Education in conjunction with the Ministry of Interior and the Central Training Corps for training for a considerable period. Article 27: The methods for training teachers in each province and city will be determined separately. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Children's Day Preparatory Committee Selects Children's Day Songs</h3>
<p>The Children's Day Preparatory Committee, organized by the Public Works Department's Child Protection Section, the Chinese Children's Welfare Association, and the Children's Welfare Association, recently, upon receiving advice from the police authorities of the two concessions, notified various schools and child welfare organizations in the city that they could hold small-scale recreational activities during this year's Children's Day. However, they were required to report directly to the police authorities of the two concessions before April 1st so that personnel could be dispatched for protection. It is now learned that the Children's Day Preparatory Committee has selected Children's Day songs and Children's Day Recreational Activity songs composed by musician Shen Binglian (see "Children's Songs and Applied Songs" published by the Children's Bookstore), considering them suitable for use by various schools and child welfare organizations. The lyrics of the songs are extracted as follows: (Children's Day Song) "April 4th, la la la la la, the sun is warm and the wind is gentle, shining brightly. Look at the myriad purples and reds displaying smiles, and the tender yellows and light greens sprouting new buds. Hehe, such a wonderful world, is our beautiful and vast one. Brothers and sisters, this is ours, la la la la la, let's play, let's celebrate, this is ours, la la la la la." (Children's Day Recreational Activity Song) "The festival meets the joyful children, the gathering opens with lively recreational activities. Let's offer a smile to everyone, not presuming shallowness and daring to show our awkwardness. Knowing our clumsiness, we still try to be skillful, please give us your guidance."</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Children's Day Preparatory Committee is actively promoting the establishment of a children's library. Since the committee announced the production and distribution of Children's Welfare Medals and accepted donations for the children's library, various elementary schools, middle schools, and even shop employees and organization staff in this city have been sending letters to the committee, stating the amount of their donations and requesting the delivery of Children's Welfare Medals as precious souvenirs. According to the person in charge of the committee, as of now, they have received 1,500 yuan in donations for the children's library. Before the 31st of this month, it will not be difficult to distribute all 100,000 Children's Welfare Medals. If the need is proven in reality, they will quickly produce second and third batches so that people from all walks of life can have the opportunity to contribute to children's welfare.</p>

<h3>Discourses on the Spirit Way</h3>
<p>The imperial decree to bestow a plaque on the Guan Di Temple in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, was respectfully recorded the day before yesterday. Because Shanxi has suffered from drought for several years, resulting in a great famine, and the relief work has not yet been completed, the people are scattered and the fields are barren, the governor, along with the heads of the provincial departments and circuits, faithfully followed the imperial decree and prayed devoutly, hoping for a generous rainfall. They set up an altar at the Guan Di Temple in the provincial capital, and indeed on the eighth day of the third month, the provincial capital and its subordinate districts received several inches of rain. On the fourteenth and fifteenth, there was another heavy rain, to the great comfort of the farmers. This is certainly due to the emperor's tireless efforts day and night, and also relies on the silent blessings of the deities. Therefore, a special memorial was submitted, requesting the imperial bestowal of a plaque. The content of the memorial was full of joyous and extravagant words, attributing the merits to the sovereign and father, without self-aggrandizement, truly embodying the principle of attributing goodness to the ruler. However, the special request to bestow a plaque in response to the deity's blessings seems to abandon human efforts and cater to the eyes and ears of the ignorant masses. Judging from the principles of governance, it is inevitable to neglect long-term goals and focus only on short-term gains. A deity is the spirit of creation, formed by the combination of Yin and Yang, formless and soundless. Ancient sages and worthies, whose essence and spirit did not dissipate, also became deities after death, receiving sacrifices from all directions and coexisting with heaven and earth, such as Guan Di. However, while virtuousness can lead to deification and the greatest response, praying for rain is not among their designated duties. In ancient times, when there were droughts or floods, the altars to the earth and grain gods were relocated. The disasters of drought and flood should be attributed to the earth and grain gods. Eliminating pests and thieves, it was said that the field ancestor had a spirit; praying for rain, it was said to welcome the field ancestor. After the annual work was completed, the La sacrifice was performed, with the First Farmer being the chief among the eight. The sacrifice to the First Farmer continues to this day, with prefectures and counties still having altars for the earth and grain gods and the First Farmer. Generally, praying for clear skies and rain is the responsibility of local officials, and the deities prayed to are those of the altars of earth and grain. As for within the provincial capital, if the head county's prayers are not effective, then the head prefecture takes over; if both the prefecture and county are not effective, then the governor and provincial commissioners take over. In the capital city, first the two counties of Shun Tian Fu and Da Wan, then princes are sent to offer incense.</p>

<h3>Finance: Chinese Merchants Eagerly Buying Forward Foreign Exchange, Mostly Supplied by Foreign Banks; Interest Rate Differential Around 4%</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday saw the HSBC exchange rate remain unchanged. In the gray market for British and American currencies, the British pound exchange rate in New York plummeted by 3/125 due to the Tomb Sweeping Day holiday, causing the spot British pound to remain at 4/125. The U.S. dollar was fortunate that HSBC and a certain American bank provided supply at 6.25 in the morning, and the tight situation did not escalate. However, the futures market was vigorously supported by Chinese merchants and importing foreign firms, followed by Chinese banks absorbing, and lacking maintenance, the tight wind was particularly sharp. In the afternoon, the April British exchange rate softened to within the 4 handle, and the U.S. dollar broke into the 6 yuan level. It was also heard that the British and American exchange rates were predicted to continue to fall today, causing the spot British exchange rate to close at 4/125 and the U.S. dollar to continue to tighten to 6.1875, compared to the pre-holiday situation of British parity and U.S. tightening of 15625. The futures market later relied on speculators taking profits, and the tight wind subsided, but it had already tightened sharply, further than the spot market. The swap points diverged further, with the difference between the spot market and the April British exchange rate being 15625, and the U.S. exchange rate differing by 2.5 jiao, resulting in a monthly interest rate of around 4%. It is said that those with large amounts of cash on hand have already begun to take action.</p>
<p>Swap Points Diverge Further</p>
<p>Early this morning, the London big strips both fell by 3/125 in the near and far months, the New York silver price remained flat, and the London bullion price was fixed. The British exchange rates against the U.S., Shanghai, and France were all flat, the U.S. dollar against the British pound narrowed by 3/125, against Shanghai it fell by 1 jiao, and against France it fell by a small 1.5 fen (all compared to the squeezed closing prices before the holiday). The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened this morning with spot selling prices of British pound at 4/125 and U.S. dollar at 6.3125, compared to the pre-holiday situation of British parity and U.S. tightening of 03125, which was due to the exchange rate squeezing and falling. After the opening, speculators first came to absorb, and the foreign firm community also vigorously followed up, so the market suddenly reported a slight tightening. It is estimated that speculators bought 6.15625 and 125 for the next month's U.S. exchange rate from foreign firms, and foreign firms also bought 6.25 for this month's U.S. exchange rate from foreign firms. At the same time, speculators also absorbed 6.125 for next month's U.S. exchange rate from Sassoon. At this time, the spot U.S. exchange rate had narrowed to 6.28125. The HSBC exchange rate remained unchanged, and the silver equilibrium tax was announced to be 1.75 fen smaller than the pre-holiday rate. After this, there was mutual buying between Yili and a certain bank, with HSBC's spot British pound at 4/125. Soon, speculators from Hong Kong also came to aggressively buy forward British and American exchange rates. Then Chinese banks such as Shanghai and East Asia followed up, and foreign firms such as HSBC were still willing to supply spot, but were very reluctant to sell forward, so the far month gradually tightened and softened. It is estimated that the Hong Kong gang bought 4/03125 and 015625 for next month's British pound from Huayi, Yili, and HSBC, and Chinese merchants bought 6.25 for this month's U.S. exchange rate from foreign firms. Later, speculators came again to buy 4 for next month's British pound from foreign firms. Then Chinese banks again bought 6.02125 and 6 for next month's U.S. exchange rate from a certain bank, and also bought 5.875 for the May U.S. exchange rate. By 11:30 AM, foreign firms were becoming increasingly reluctant to supply, with the next month's British pound only available at 3/984375, and the U.S. dollar only available at 5.96875. However, the spot market remained stable, with the British pound still firmly standing at 4/125 and the U.S. dollar still at 6.25. After this, the spot market remained unchanged until the noon closing. The spot market tightened by 0625 for the British pound and the U.S. dollar compared to the morning opening. The futures market tightened by 046875 and softened by 1875 for the U.S. dollar compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>The U.S. Dollar Enters 6 Yuan in April</p>
<p>The after-market gang continued to buy in, and local speculators also continued to be active, so the market tightened and softened again. It is estimated that the Hong Kong gang bought 3/984375 and 96875 for the next month's British pound from foreign firms. Speculators bought 5.96875 and 9375 for the same month's U.S. dollar from foreign firms such as Yili, Datong, Huayi, and a certain bank. Later, Chinese merchants again bought 6.1875 for the spot U.S. exchange rate from foreign firms. After buying in, there was a slight sell-off of the current month due to floating profits, but it was easily absorbed by buyers, so it was difficult to recover for a long time. Until the closing, the British pound was at 4/125, the U.S. dollar was at 6.1875, the current month's British pound was at 4/0625, the U.S. dollar was at 6.15625, the next month's British pound was at 3/928125, and the U.S. dollar was at 5.90625. As a result, the spot market tightened by 15625 for the British pound and the U.S. dollar compared to before the holiday. The current month shrunk by 046875 for the British pound and softened by 125 for the U.S. dollar. The next month was more expensive by 09375 for the British pound and tightened by 28125 for the U.S. dollar.</p>
<h3>Gold Market After the Holiday: Soars and Soars, Peak Seen at 5385 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's open market situation for spot gold was vibrant, even more spectacular than before the holiday, reaching its peak. As a result, it rose by a huge 212 yuan, continuing to set a new record high for gold prices. With the excitement of the people and the environment perceived as bullish, buyers were unusually crowded. Although holders of goods were seen selling off at high prices from time to time, they were all absorbed. The supply and demand of positions remained difficult to balance. The initial opening was due to the tight foreign exchange report, and the market atmosphere was already strong, with the price at 5230 yuan. Although the securities gang slightly retreated by several dozen yuan due to selling, the exchange market at this time did not change its soft state. It was also heard that the futures market was extraordinarily tight, and gold firms and money changers competed to buy, causing it to jump again to 5320 yuan. Extended until the noon closing, it was still firmly stationed above 5295 yuan. Unexpectedly, the rising wind intensified in the afternoon, with the large-scale search and purchase by another securities gang having a great impact. The secret activities of the Hong Kong gang were also active, causing the unprecedented price of 5385 yuan to be seen immediately. Moreover, after this, buying and selling still felt that there were more buyers than sellers, and the market closed at 5370 yuan. The overall trading volume was quite strong, about 3000 taels. The price of jewelry gold in silver shops rose by 20 yuan, creating an unprecedentedly high price. The customs gold, etc. were all flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Sharply Rises by More Than 200 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, the initial opening was good for each bar (ten taels), with tight foreign exchange reports and even better morale, and buying surged. A certain gold firm and silver shop raised prices to absorb, and the opening was a sharp rise of 72 yuan. The gold firm entered 50 taels for money exchange firms, at 5230 yuan. After a short while, a certain securities gang took profits and went to market in huge amounts, and the rising momentum was immediately blocked. Not long after, it returned slightly to 30 yuan, and the money exchange firm sold 50 taels, at 5200 yuan. Then the U.S. exchange rate continued to tighten, and it was heard that the futures market was particularly soft, and people's hearts were even more excited. Money exchange firms and spot gold firms scrambled to aggressively advance, and individual investors entered more and sold less. Moreover, a certain securities gang's selling intentions gradually faded, so the rising wind resumed, and it jumped again by 120 yuan. The gold firm and money exchange firms jointly entered 50 taels from the securities gang, at 5320 yuan. After this, silver shops turned from buying to selling, and the number of entrants gradually decreased. Moreover, the silver shop gang took advantage of the high price to frequently block, and then dropped back by 32 yuan. The silver shop sold 50 taels to the money exchange firm, at 5288 yuan. Later, a certain money exchange firm came to buy again, and it was raised again by 7 yuan. The silver shop entered 20 taels from the securities gang, with a noon closing price of 5295 yuan. In the afternoon, the market situation was even stronger. The opening was 30 yuan higher, and the silver shop entered 30 taels from the securities gang, at 5325 yuan. Subsequently, a certain money exchange firm continued to aggressively advance, and a certain securities gang added code on behalf of large clients, and the exchange market futures were even tighter. Although a certain money exchange firm sold a limited amount, it still felt that there was too little porridge and too many monks, so it jumped again by 45 yuan. The securities gang entered 50 taels from the silver shop, at 5370 yuan. Later, the spot gold firm and individual investors sold off, and it fell back by 25 yuan. The gold firm sold 30 taels to the money exchange firm, at 5345 yuan. After buying again, a certain securities gang came to search and purchase again, and it rose again by 40 yuan. The silver shop entered 40 taels from the securities gang, at 5385 yuan. Near the close, a certain gold firm took profits and resold, immediately returning 15 yuan. The gold firm sold 30 taels to the money exchange firm, with a late closing price of 5370 yuan. As a result, it soared by 212 yuan compared to before the holiday, fluctuating by 185 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the spot gold firm's own brand gold was higher by several yuan according to the spot price, and the purchase price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current bid gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and almost no business was done.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Suspended at 540 Yuan</p>
<p>The initial selling price of jewelry gold per tael in silver shops was still suspended at 520 yuan in the Datong line. At 9:30, it was raised by 5 yuan. At 10:40, it was raised by another big 5 yuan. At 11:20, it was raised again by 5 yuan. At 2:45 in the afternoon, it was hung up by another big 5 yuan. There were no changes after this. As a result, it was raised by a total of 20 yuan. It is estimated that Datong Bank changed its suspension to 540 yuan, which is an unprecedented record since the market. The new banks also had the same prices as above, and the purchase price was reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Rises in a Straight Line</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation was such that, due to the unabated fall of the British pound, although the black market U.S. exchange rate here was being vigorously maintained by HSBC and Citibank, the buying pressure was ultimately difficult to suppress, and the potential for future softness was even greater. This is because it is generally believed that the pound price may continue to decline. Therefore, U.S. dollar notes are becoming increasingly popular, and the strength of buying interest is unparalleled. The market price rose in a straight line, and the evening market rose again to the extraordinary price of 16 yuan, 1 jiao, and 5 fen. Conversely, the trend of British gold notes was very soft, and British and American gold pounds rose endlessly with the remaining price. Hong Kong notes rose with the Hong Kong exchange rate. Demand for Dutch notes was not weak. Canadian notes and Philippine notes tightened with the U.S. exchange rate. The trend of Korean notes was quite strong, with the evening market rising to 9 jiao, 9 fen, and 5 li. Only the supply of Japanese gold notes was endless, and the market atmosphere was sluggish, with the evening market retreating to 1 yuan, 3 jiao, 1 fen, and 6 li. Yesterday's market price was the largest for British and American gold pounds, rising by 4 yuan and a half, followed by Canadian notes, rising by 4 jiao, U.S. dollar notes rising by 3 jiao and 3 fen, Hong Kong notes rising by 2 fen, Dutch notes rising by 1 jiao, and Philippine notes rising by 2 jiao and a half. Only British gold notes fell by 5 fen, and the rest were immeasurable.</p>
<h3>Food: Rice Prices Tend to Rise</h3>
<p>After rice prices had fully risen the day before yesterday, they had once returned to a state of fatigue, and people did not dare to trade rashly. Except for the original root merchants and vendors who still had no intention of quickly selling and continued to hold, the minds of other floating hoarders and retail households, seeing that there was a thin profit to be made, frequently sold off. Until the middle of the market, the prices of various goods had fallen by almost half a yuan. For example, No. 1 Saigon was only 40 yuan and 5 jiao, No. 2 was 37 yuan and a half, fire-polished was 39 yuan, and small-polished was 37 yuan and 3 jiao. Who knew that the market was so changeable? The market goods suddenly became scarce. In general, the guests wanted to seek cheap purchases, but they were not easy to obtain. Then, the mainland gangs came out to search and purchase, causing a chain reaction. Whether retail or wholesale, it felt more lively. The selling parties' shouts rose one after another, and the overall situation reversed the fatigue of the early market and presented a rising state. It completely restored what had been lost. At that time, the original root goods were also launched at high prices, and the market goods gradually turned to more. Until the closing, there was no change. In terms of first fatigue and then tightening, it became flat, and the closing price was the same as before. It is estimated that No. 1 Saigon was 41 yuan and a half, No. 2 was 38 yuan, fire-polished was 39 yuan and a half, small grain was 28 yuan, 37 yuan and 8 jiao, Siamese long grain was 40 yuan and 5 jiao, 40 yuan, No. 2 was 38 yuan and a half, 38 yuan, Tokyo short grain was high from 28 yuan, then to 37 yuan, mixed broken grain was high at 34 yuan, and low at 32 yuan. The road for glutinous rice continued to be sluggish, and it continued to show a soft appearance. Korean rice, such as thick and thin japonica and early and late indica rice, remained beautiful due to the scarcity of incoming sources and the firmness and tightness of foreign rice. It is said that there were many transactions in the open market outside the venue. Korean high-quality japonica was 45 yuan and a half, 45 yuan, medium and secondary was 434 yuan, Qingsi Zhen special thin was 45 yuan, city was 44 yuan, early and late indica rice was 43 yuan, 5 jiao and 6 jiao.</p>
<p>Foreign rice is flooding in, continuing to arrive with 30,000 to 40,000 bags during the holiday, and the cargo on the way is also endless. Therefore, in the midst of exchange rate contraction and gold price rises, the selling price could not be raised. No. 1 Saigon was 41 yuan, 5 jiao and 6 jiao, which was similar to the previous market. However, due to the difficulty of allocating new orders, the return futures were held firm, and although spot rice had not risen, the market shape was already showing a good appearance. However, because the return futures price differed from the new order price by 5 or 6 yuan, both Chinese and foreign merchants were unwilling to sell lightly with the market, and the customers and the local street trade were becoming more and more interested in hoarding, so the market gradually saw an increase. The initial opening price of small-grained rice was 45 yuan per original bag, and in the afternoon it increased by half a yuan to 45 yuan and a half. No. 2 Saigon's return spot goods were 46 yuan per original bag in spot market, 46 yuan and a half in April, and 46 yuan and 7 jiao in the afternoon. No. 1 opened at 49 yuan and a half, and then shouted up to 50 yuan. More than 600 tons were opened throughout the day, and there were also 6,000 bags of spot goods.</p>
<h3>Foreign Wheat is About to Arrive: Flour Market Loosens Secretly</h3>
<p>The flour market opened yesterday, and transactions were still deserted. This is because, since the factory price was revised to 13 yuan and 8 jiao, although the flour shops claimed to be selling at a flat price, those who inquired were already few. It is said that the retail price of the old brand per bag has been changed from 14 yuan to 13 yuan and 9 jiao, and the return market is also secretly loosened. The old Dong brand only opened at 13 yuan and 6 jiao and a half, only embellished by the occasional scattered sales from the mainland and rural villages. As for the customer sales, it was even more silent. The factory was even more eager to pull up the prices, and was not willing to supply, so the market was as calm as usual.</p>
<p>Wheat transactions were still active. The Japanese factories and the export route felt lonely, but the Chinese factories were slightly interested. It is estimated that 6,500 bags were taken by the Fuxin Factory Office and 100 bags were taken by the Fufeng Factory Office, all of which were Changzhou-Wuxi wheat, with a price of 23 yuan and 5 jiao. There were no significant changes in the market for the time being. It is said that the foreign wheat previously ordered by the factories has already been loaded and is on the way. It is feared that a large batch of foreign wheat will arrive in Shanghai soon, so the future of wheat prices also seems to be a secretly loosening image of the flour market.</p>
<h3>Securities: Foreign Banks All Have Excellent Dividends</h3>
<p>Securities gray market trading resumed as usual yesterday, but some internal reforms are still underway and being closely organized. Market conditions initially fell and then rose, and the motivation for the fluctuations was initially thought to be due to the soaring price of gold and rumors of the issuance of treasury bills, which would naturally be unfavorable to government bonds. Therefore, market prices once fell slightly, three or four jiao compared to the market prices before the holiday. After entering the market, some people actively pushed up the prices, thinking that treasury bills would benefit government bonds, and then prices suddenly rose again, better than before by two or three jiao. It can be seen that people's minds are confused by this. In fact, the issuance of treasury bills is entirely for controlling foreign exchange, and there must be a provisional exchange rate, both externally and internally. To say that it is beneficial to government bonds is too profound to fathom. Before the advantages and disadvantages are clearly understood, there will still be some twists and turns. Yesterday morning, Tongsheng Renchang and ordinary retail investors sold heavily. Class C bonds gradually fell to eight yuan and four jiao. However, due to the absorption of shares by Lianyi Xieda Xinfu at low prices, the market returned to an upward trend. In the afternoon, it was initially stable and then firm. Class C bonds once reached above nine yuan, and Xinfu Lianyi Shengda and others bought in quite a bit. As for others like Lianhe Tongkang Yongkang, they took this and abandoned that, or abandoned this and took that, simply exchanging and trading with each other. As a result, except for Class D bonds, which were slightly lower by one jiao, the rest all recovered by two or three jiao to four and a half jiao. The turnover was about one million. A concise table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 100 shares of Ning Shao Steamship Company were traded at a price of twelve yuan and five jiao, a dramatic increase of two or three yuan compared to before.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Chinese Hui Tong Foreign Firm, Zhimo Rubber Co., Ltd., recently resolved in a board meeting to convene the 28th annual shareholders' meeting on April 4. It is reported that the company's 1939 profits reached more than 200,000 national currency. In addition to the interim dividend that has already been paid, five fen per share of national currency, it is proposed to continue to pay a final dividend of one jiao and five fen per share of national currency, totaling two jiao of national currency.</p>
<p>The 1939 dividend of the Anglo-Chinese Great Britain Water and Fire Company is proposed to be eight jiao per share of national currency, which is equivalent to an annual interest rate of eight percent.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Chinese Mai Jia Li Bank is scheduled to hold its annual shareholders' meeting in London on April 3. It is proposed to continue to pay an annual interest rate of one percent for the final dividend of 1939, for a total of two percent per year including the interim dividend.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Chinese You Li Bank proposes to continue to pay an annual interest rate of six percent for the final dividend of 1939, for a total of one point two percent per year including the interim dividend.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Spirits are High, Double Horse Futures Yarn Exceeds the 1,000 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>The yarn market, after the Tomb Sweeping Festival holiday, continued to trend upward, and the current situation is particularly tense. This is because the exchange rate between the US and British currencies is shrinking, coupled with the soaring price of gold, so people's spirits are high and buying has resumed, and the market price has risen sharply. At the same time, the actual demand in Southern Guangdong is increasingly developing, and the foundation of the current yarn is becoming more and more solid. The yarn market has gained this momentum, and the upward pressure is particularly strong. However, some industry peers, because their base has reached a high peak, are unwilling to go long and instead are selling. However, March 20s Double Horse has already broken through the 1,000 yuan mark. The highest price for April 20s Double Horse futures has reached 1,047 yuan, falling slightly back to 1,015 yuan.</p>
<p>The morning opening market situation for current yarn is still peaceful. Because of the customs closure, the overseas cotton market is flat. Some colleagues are selling, so the opening price for this month's 20s Double Horse is 988 yuan, and the price for April is 1,012 yuan, falling slightly to 1,006 yuan. Then, news of the exchange rate shrinking spread, and morale was boosted. This month's Double Horse rose to 990 yuan, and April's rose to 1,018 yuan. Until nearly 11 o'clock, the price of gold soared, and the buying frenzy was intense, rising directly to 1,037 yuan, and this month also reached 1,010 yuan. However, after the close, it fell back slightly by more than ten yuan. The transaction statistics for half a day show 2,958 bales traded, and the price of 20s Variegated Horse spot goods rose 21 yuan, and futures rose 16 yuan. The amount bought by each group is listed on the left: Hong Kong 935, Mainland 20, Fellow Traders 1,995, Total 2,950</p>
<h3>Cotton Price Increase Not as Strong as Yarn</h3>
<p>Cotton trading is not prosperous, but the American cotton business is particularly prosperous, so the market situation is still moderate. The factories are not open, but the traders' minds are still optimistic. However, currently due to the relationship with the money market, coupled with the flat momentum of foreign cotton, the price increase of the cotton market is not as strong as the yarn market. The source of Su Bei is estimated to be 796 bales of Tonghua. The current cotton market and transactions are listed on the left: Meter Lin 261.50 264.25 Fellow Traders entered 1,200 pieces of Tongda package 210.00, also 180 pieces of Hangzhou cotton 192.00, also 499 bales of Changre cotton 208.25, also 200 bales of Taicang cotton 210.00, also 200 bales.</p>
<p>Another piece of information on foreign cotton market prices: the New York cotton market, in the early morning of yesterday, was initially weak due to overseas cotton merchants selling in the market. Later, due to purchases from Wall Street and some short covering, cotton prices rose slightly. As a result, the closing price fell by 35 pounds for the near term and rose by 2 pounds for the far term. The Indian cotton market fell by more than three rupees yesterday, including forecasts. The Egyptian market was closed.</p>
<h3>Market Situation Summary</h3>
<p>Cloth Market: Opened in the morning with a slight increase. Later, due to the surge in gold prices, customers with real needs and hoarders rushed to buy, and the market price rose steadily, continuing to rise by five jiao to one yuan per pi compared to the morning market. As a result, Fugui and Dapeng fine cloth jumped up by two and a half yuan per pi compared to the market price on the 21st. The remaining fine cloth and twill also rose by five jiao to seven and a half jiao. Coarse cloth rose by two and a half jiao to one yuan. Bleached and dyed cloth rose by five jiao to one yuan. The transaction volume of various cloths in this street exceeded 1,000 pieces. The Wen Yong Gang of Zhejiang Road handled more than 300 pieces of fine cloth and bleached and dyed cloth. The Min Yue Gang handled more than 200 pieces. The Chuan Dian Gang handled colored cloth, flannel, fine cloth, etc., more than 200 pieces.</p>
<p>Oil Market: Yesterday's trend was stable. In the afternoon, rumors spread that the peanut oil production had dropped sharply, so soybean oil was also hit. Everyone was bearish. The entire city only traded 20 barrels of Qingdao raw oil and 10 barrels of North Benfang oil in the afternoon. Dalian soybean oil was 270 barrels, Jiaozhou soybean oil was 300 pieces, and Jiangbei and Changzhou oil was 30 barrels. Prices were all cut by one or two yuan.</p>

<h3>Before the Establishment of the "Children's Library"</h3>
<p>— Guo Minqiang</p>
<p>The 15,000 yuan funding for the "Children's Library" has already started to be raised. The establishment of this library will also be formally established after this year's Children's Day (date not yet determined). Isn't this good news for children? Of course! Children must be very excited about this and hold great hope.</p>
<p>Although I am an older child, I also have great enthusiasm for this matter that is beneficial to children. Now, with the utmost sincerity, I will write down some of my personal contributions to a "Children's Library" below:</p>
<p>Training children should be based on the development of children's physical and mental health and on the foundation of just morality. Therefore, the books collected by the children's library should be:</p>
<p>(1) Focus on the cultivation of children's physical and mental aspects.</p>
<p>(2) Include more illustrations, and the pictures are best printed in color.</p>
<p>(3) Although the environment in Shanghai is very bad, we should not change the spiritual food of children because of the bad environment. That is to say, within the possible range, we should also collect more children's books that are beneficial to the war of resistance.</p>
<p>Regarding the charging of fees, I also have the following opinions:</p>
<p>(1) Children who are recommended by the school to join the library will not be charged a deposit.</p>
<p>(2) In order to encourage reading, outstanding and model children in each school should be exempted from the deposit and borrowing fees.</p>
<p>(3) The annual borrowing fee should be as low as possible, and poor children can pay in installments. The deposit should also be low, and poor children can apply for free admission.</p>
<p>(4) Children who read in the library will not be charged a reading fee.</p>
<p>I think the above small opinions can also be used as a reference for the preparatory committee of the "Children's Library."</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that all the ladies in Shanghai will donate more money to enrich this children's library. This is the happiness of all the children in Shanghai, and it is also the happiness of their own children.</p>
<h3>A Thorough "Tuberculosis Prevention Movement"</h3>
<p>— Li Fu</p>
<p>Mr. Gitz said: "To promote the tuberculosis prevention movement in the lower classes, in addition to carrying out extensive publicity and telling them to pay attention to hygiene... a general inspection should also be carried out. People with tuberculosis should be asked to move away; and to receive treatment." That's right! This valuable opinion is undoubtedly the best way to prevent the spread of tuberculosis. However, the poor people of the lower classes mostly have problems even with eating, so where would they get a large sum of money to use for medical expenses for treatment? And who would be willing to take on the responsibility of "treating them"? However, in order to make the "tuberculosis prevention movement" thorough and to improve the value of the "tuberculosis prevention movement," it is necessary to "treat them." It must be known that tuberculosis prevention must start with eliminating tuberculosis, curing patients, eliminating tuberculosis bacteria, and getting rid of the fate of infection. That is the fundamental way to prevent tuberculosis.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, tuberculosis is an extremely chronic disease. Those who seek treatment must not only have sufficient time, but also need a comfortable environment. The most appropriate thing is to enter a sanatorium, so that they can be treated with reasonable recuperation methods and surgical treatment at the same time. That is the only way to be sure of a cure. However, in today's society, where money is the standard for measuring class, even if one lives in a third-class ward of a charitable hospital, the cost per person per month is around 100 yuan. Therefore, after the lower classes discover that they have tuberculosis, those who can receive reasonable treatment and have a guarantee of a cure are really very few.</p>
<p>To save the thousands of tuberculosis patients in the lower classes, to eliminate tuberculosis bacteria, to prevent the spread of infection, and to make the "tuberculosis prevention movement" more thorough, I hope that the tuberculosis prevention authorities will allocate a large sum from the huge donations of all the great benefactors to create a truly affordable sanatorium for the common people, and to hire professional talents who are "doctors" to support this thorough tuberculosis prevention work. If it is limited by financial resources and it is impossible to do it to this extent, at least a part of the donations should be allocated to reliable sanatoriums as medical expenses for third-class patients to reduce the burden of poverty and disease. If this can be done, the "tuberculosis prevention movement" will have a fruitful harvest.</p>
<p>Finally, with ten thousand points of sincerity, I urge the celebrities and enthusiastic benefactors of our society to take on the responsibility of "saving lives," to generously donate and contribute, and to jointly complete the thorough "tuberculosis prevention movement."</p>
<h3>How Many Days a Year Do You Actually Study?</h3>
<p>— Sun Dingkui</p>
<p>After Mr. Xia Yu’s article "How Many Days a Year Do You Study" was published, we received a manuscript from Mr. Sun Dingkui, stating that Mr. Xia did not deduct the Sundays in the spring, summer, and winter vacations from the "52 Sundays," so the number of days he calculated was not accurate. However, due to space limitations in that issue, it could not be published. In the previous issue, due to Mr. Zhang Yiliao’s special article, it had to be postponed for another issue. During this period, we received no fewer than forty or fifty submissions on this issue, and most of them were sent by students from various schools. This shows the students’ attention to "school time," which is exactly the intention of Mr. Xia in writing that article. Whether it is accurate or not is another matter, so I will copy Mr. Xia’s conclusion below: "Life is short, youth is precious, and the opportunity to study is rare. How hard should we work to live up to this precious academic year!" I will give this to the students, and I apologize for not disclosing the submissions one by one. (Editor)</p>
<p>How many days a semester does a student actually study in school without taking leave? Didn’t this publication already carry a statistic the day before yesterday? However, this statistic has some discrepancies, because the author did not deduct the "Sundays" during the holidays from the "52 days." As for the length of the summer vacation, it may be different for universities and primary and secondary schools.</p>
<p>Spring Break: 7 days (including 1 Sunday) Summer Vacation (July 4 to August 21): 49 days (including 7 Sundays)</p>
<p>New Year's Day: 3 days</p>
<p>Winter Break: 14 days (including 2 Sundays)</p>
<p>The above is based on the Ministry of Education's primary and secondary school calendar, plus</p>
<p>Sundays: 52 days (10 days within the holidays should be deducted)</p>
<p>Saturday afternoons are not generally for rest, or some schools have classes suspended, but are also holding various children's center activities, which is also the implementation of education and should not be considered as a holiday.</p>
<p>The above totals 123 days of vacation. As for exceptional holidays, each school only has one day for the school anniversary each year; classes are suspended due to exams, about three or four days per semester, which is calculated as four days, eight days a year, totaling 131 days of holidays. If a teacher is absent, the school authorities should find a way to make up for it. According to this calculation, there are still 133 days of classes in a year of 365 days, and there are 116 and a half days in a semester. Isn't this very different from yesterday's statistics? However, students in school should not think that the number of days of study has increased and casually skip class. They should still follow Mr. Xia's advice and bury themselves in hard work.</p>
<h3>Chen Taoyi</h3>
<p>— Lu Tao</p>
<p>Since the Daily Mail recently mistranslated Zhang Xiaoyi, the Minister of Judicial Administration among the newly appointed officials, as Chen Taoyi, Chen Taoyi, who had not been noticed by society for a long time, suddenly attracted attention in these twelve hours, until the next day's newspaper stated that it was Zhang Xiaoyi, the Daily Mail solemnly corrected and apologized deeply, so it was suddenly realized why the mistranslation occurred.</p>
<p>It is important to know that Zhang and Chen differ by only one letter in English spelling, Yi and Yi are similar in pronunciation, and although Xiao and Tao are different, they may be close in pronunciation when read in a certain local dialect. Moreover, Zhang Xiaoyi's name is rarely heard among southerners, so it is no wonder that there was a misunderstanding of Chen Taoyi for a time.</p>
<p>As for Chen Taoyi's personality, the Daily Mail's "high moral character and integrity, admired by all" certainly shows Chen Taoyi's personality; and Shuang Yu Daoren Tang Dingzhi's inscription for Chen's guest room, "Retiring from fate and closing the door, knowing leisure in recuperating," further shows Chen's broad-mindedness, unlike the common people, from which it can be seen that it is not wrong to know the strong grass after a strong wind!</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 22: News Reports Fly from Beyond the Heavens; Loftily Discussed Theories are Believed by People</p>
<p>After looking at the typesetting room, they went to the editorial office on the second floor. At this time, the evening newspapers for each day had already been completed, and the morning edition for the next day had not yet started work. Most of the editors would gradually arrive after dinner and begin working. Therefore, the large editorial room seemed empty with only a few people inside. The desks arranged inside were all different. Some were arranged in a circular shape, some in a rectangular shape, some in a T-shape, and some in a U-shape. Some tables were specially made. And each desk had one or several telephones. Wu Junsu asked, "Do these editors have to arrive every day?" Qu Wufeng said, "Since they are editors of a daily newspaper, of course they have to arrive every day. However, they cannot all arrive. At least seven out of ten arrive every day. Because some are sent by the newspaper to go abroad, some travel to increase their knowledge, and some are on vacation and do not have to come to the newspaper. Because the news industry never stops for the whole year, unlike other industries, which have a weekly holiday. Therefore, news reporters each have two months of vacation each year to make up for the lack of weekly rest. During this vacation, of course, they are paid their salaries, and they can travel to relax their minds and bodies. As for the things they are in charge of, others can take their place. When others are on vacation, he also has to take their place, so there is no hindrance to business." At that time, He Liyu asked again, "Is there any significance to the way the desks are arranged in your editorial office?" Qu Wushuang smiled and said, "There is no major significance to this. However, sitting together in each section is just for discussion and analysis. Therefore, the desks are arranged in groups. For example, our news is divided into three major sections: (1) Foreign Section; (2) Domestic Section; (3) Local Section. The Foreign Section is further divided into the European Group, the American Group, and the Asian Group. The Domestic Section has many more groups. Just within China itself, it is divided into several groups. For example, in the past, Mongolia and Tibet were grouped together, called the Mongolia-Tibet Group. But now Mongolia and Tibet are gradually being developed, and the regions are far apart, so they cannot be grouped together, so they have been divided into the Mongolia Group and the Tibet Group. The analysis within the Local Section is not two-dimensional, but three-dimensional. It is probably divided into the Commercial Group, the Industrial Group, the Foreign Residents Group, the Social Group, the Cultural Group, and so on. Each section has a section chief, and each group has a group leader. Of course, they all want to be together, so their desks are also placed together." (255)</p>

<h3>Anna May Wong in the United States Appeals for Relief for Compatriots Suffering in Her Homeland</h3>
<p>— Qiu Wen</p>
<p>The famous Chinese-American actress of Paramount Pictures, Miss Anna May Wong, was invited by the American International Charitable Organization on the evening of the 12th of this month, especially at the Atoare Broadcasting Station in Chicago, USA, to make an emergency broadcast appealing for relief for tens of millions of compatriots suffering from hunger and cold in her homeland. Although Miss Wong lives in a foreign country, she is well aware of the difficult situation and suffering of her compatriots in her homeland due to the war. Therefore, she gave a detailed description in this speech. Secondly, she also mentioned that countless wounded men in her homeland are fighting for justice this time, and because there is no sufficient medicine to give them treatment, they have not been able to recover sooner, which the government of her homeland considers regrettable. Therefore, she also appealed to all Americans to continue to provide medical assistance. Finally, Miss Wong expressed her gratitude to the US government and the majority of ladies for the various assistance they have given to the Chinese government and people in the past three years, and deeply believes that her homeland will never forget the kindness given by the sympathetic countries.</p>
<p>According to the results of Miss Wong's emergency appeal for relief to the American people this time, it will surely arouse the support and sympathy of ladies throughout the United States. Therefore, major newspapers and magazines throughout the Americas have given detailed coverage in prominent positions. It is believed that Miss Wong's speech this time will be able to particularly move the attention of enthusiastic gentlemen and ladies throughout the United States and be able to achieve good results.</p>
<h3>Sui Han Theater Company Will Perform a Spoken Drama</h3>
<p>— Cong Cong</p>
<p>This sentence is almost thirty years old: On a section of Nanjing Road near the Bund, there was a Chun Liu Theater, and the actors were Ouyang Yuqian, Wu Wozun, Lu Jingruo, Lu Lusha, and others. The performances were close to today's spoken drama, and different from a kind of so-called "Civilized Drama." Whenever I had time, I would always run there and sit for a few hours. Later, the so-called "Civilized Drama" became popular, Chun Liu was destroyed, and I had no connection with drama. But in the middle there was a period when we asked Mr. Tian Han to teach Japanese. Tian Han was studying drama, and he chose a play by Mushanokōji Saneatsu, "Sister," as our reader. I loved this play, which was sad and beautiful. At the same time, I also read many other plays, but the drama on the sea was still unrelated to me.</p>
<p>Last year, in a certain school near my residence, several young people who loved spoken drama organized a Sui Han Theater Company. For several months, I have not seen their performances, but from the name of their theater company and the well-educated directors, I imagine that the plays they perform will surely be thought-provoking, and the techniques they perform will not follow the trend. Therefore, I recently heard that they decided to perform at the LaFayette Theater on Children's Day, and I am happy to introduce them to the isolated island public.</p>
<h3>Unofficial History of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Lao Tan's Extraordinary Intelligence (Part 1)</p>
<p>Today's people often think that the actors who served in the inner court during the Qing Dynasty must have lived in extremely superior and respectable circumstances, and they often feel envious. In fact, their mechanical lives completely lost their freedom: and they were very careful, and were in constant danger of "accompanying the emperor as if accompanying a tiger." Tan Yingxiu received special favor from the Empress Dowager Cixi and actually obtained the honorary title of Prince Belle, which can be said to be extremely respectable; however, whenever he received a summons from the inner court, he would always say with self-hatred when he got up at dawn: "The Empress Dowager always won't let us off, why do we have to do this on such a cold day?" It turned out that Tan was addicted to opium, and usually got up very late. If he received a summons, he could not sleep peacefully. Sometimes, fearing that he would be late and miss the performance, he would often sit and wait for dawn. And when performing in front of the Emperor and Empress, he was also afraid that he would lose his voice due to lack of sleep, which would result in the crime of failing to perform his duties properly. Not only would it be difficult to win the Empress's reward, but he would also be reprimanded by the Grand Eunuch, which would greatly affect his face and reputation. Lao Tan's saying this shows that his heart is as fine as silk and that he is afraid of things when they happen. However, precisely because of this, he was able to maintain his reputation throughout and rarely made any mistakes or impolite acts. I will now give an example of something that shows Tan's extraordinary intelligence, and his alertness, cleverness, and ability to please the Empress were probably beyond the reach of ordinary actors. On a certain year (the year of the goat), on the Empress Dowager's birthday, Tan performed "Catching and Releasing" in the inner court. When he was in dialogue with Cao Cao and recited the phrase "That old man is kind enough to kill pigs and slaughter sheep to entertain you and me, do not be suspicious for a moment," he suddenly changed "kill pigs and slaughter sheep" to "kill pigs and slaughter cattle." At the time, everyone who heard it thought that Lao Tan had misread the words; however, singing in the palace is not like tea gardens outside, and even if there are occasional mistakes, no one will boo. However, the inner eunuchs such as Li Lianying, Cui Huishi, and Wei Bubao were all connoisseurs of music, and the Emperor, Empress, princes, and nobles were especially versed in the theory of drama and could also put on makeup and perform on stage. Moreover, "Catching and Releasing" was a play that was often listened to, and Tan was always excellent in his performance of it. Now, Lao Tan suddenly changed sheep to cattle, how could he hide it from everyone?</p>
<h3>Secrets Behind the Silver Screen</h3>
<p>— Tyrone</p>
<p>——How to Dub——</p>
<p>When you see buildings collapsing, planes crashing, and other strange noises on the screen, it always makes you frightened. This is of course filmed using models, but how are their sounds dubbed? Looking at the copper picture above will answer your question. (There are six pictures in total, which will be published in six installments)</p>
<p>(1) Earthquake Sound</p>
<p>A wooden board nailed with sandpaper is placed on a bass drum, and then a stone is slid down from the board. The sound is exactly like an earthquake.</p>
<h3>Prelude to "The Assassin"</h3>
<p>— Yi Ying</p>
<p>The story of "The Assassin" is taken from the most exciting period in the turbulent struggle on the line of survival of several small countries that had not yet been conquered by the King of Qin at the end of the Warring States period. "The Assassin" accommodates as many valuable materials as possible. It writes about the King of Qin's tyranny, and at the same time it also writes about the resentment and suffering of the people. The more unrestrained the King of Qin's laughter, the more profound the people's pain. But although the feeling of pain is strengthened in everyone's heart, a superior sense of resistance is bound to be ignited from latent to burning.</p>
<p>Thus, nurtured by the environment, we find the emergence of Jing Ke, a representative of thousands of ordinary people. For the survival of the nation and the liberation of the nation, he is willing to sacrifice for the freedom of thousands of ordinary people. His great spirit touches everyone's hearts. In "The Assassin," Wang Yuanlong deeply tasted this purpose, and fully revealed the heroic spirit and patriotic enthusiasm of this warrior. We pay tribute to the warrior on the screen, and even more so to the superior consciousness of this "The Assassin."</p>
