<p>社評</p>
<h3>德蘇簽訂商務協定</h3>
<p>日昨莫斯科和柏林，同時發表公告，宣佈德蘇新商務協定業已正式簽字。協定的內容，據稱係規定蘇聯以原料交換德國的工業品，並提高雙方貿易的數量。這一協定的成立，在目前的國際情形下面，自是具有極大的意義；但不知道個商的簽訂之後，是否還隨着有春雲展開的局面。記得去年八月，德蘇締結信用借款協定後，兩國旋即簽訂互不侵犯協定；幾天後，德國立即在東歐燃起一把烽火，蘇聯也隨着進兵波蘭，逐漸演變而成為今日的二次歐戰。以此例彼，德蘇新商的簽字之後，她們會不會單獨的或共同的在東南歐有所舉動，這倒是很可以值得注意的。</p>
<p>至若單就德蘇新商務協定的本身而言，似乎也有兩種不同的作用：一為政治的、一屬經濟的。從政治方面言：這决德蘇商務協定的成立，顯在表示德蘇結合的加强；對於英國欲藉拉攏英蘇商務關係，以謀減少蘇聯對於德國輸出的企圖，至少是一打擊。德國一般輿論，咸認此舉為經濟同盟，無疑的，也就是一種向英法示威的性質。同時對於巴爾幹協商各國。多少也含有一點警戒的意義。因為巴爾幹協商各國，最近正在討論互助辦法，對於英法的援助芬蘭政策，也有表示贊同的傾向，這不能不使蘇聯有所不滿。</p>
<p>從經濟方面言：這當然是德國的一個巨大收穫。德國自被英法封鎖海面父通之後，在經濟上所受的影響，雖不如外人所宣傳的那樣惡劣；開戰以後，她對鄰近各國的貿易，衰落的少而增加的多；但是德國是一個工業高皮發達的國家，國內又缺乏各種主要的原料和食料，海上貿易斷絕，總歸是經濟上一個巨大的威脅；而日鄰近各國，因環境的關係，又未必能儘量供給她的需要。如羅馬尼亞的煤油，就不能將超過某種限度的數量輸往德國。可是國土廣大的蘇聯，却具有各種豐富的原料；最近自經過幾决五年計劃之後，工農生產能力，俱較從前大量增加。經濟力的偉大，一般經濟學者多認為足以決定世界大戰的勝負。如德國所亟需的煤油，蘇聯的生產量，僅决於美，而居世界第一位置。他如鋼鐵及其牠各種金屬和食糧，也都有大量的生產。同時蘇聯對於外國的工業製造品和機械，也很感覺需要。所以蘇聯這種的經濟狀態。實頗適宜於戰時德國的經濟同盟，果眞德蘇兩國能切實履行她們所簽訂商務協定，這確足使英法對德的經濟封鎖失去相當的效力。</p>
<p>不公平德蘇商務協定，將來到底進行到若何的程度，前尚難加以判斷。假如雙方都無意外問題，都願意履行條的的義務。其中也有不少的困難存在：第一，蘇聯是否眞有大量原料可以輸德？近十餘年蘇聯所實施的第一二三次五年計劃，主要的目的，是什消除對國外的依賴性；故原料及食料的生產，和國內的需要，常保持均衡的狀態。我們在蘇聯對外貿易上可以看到的：近幾年來進口最多的是機器，鋼鐵，橡皮，羊毛等物；但在輸出方面最多的，却是木材食糧和皮革等物，而不是大量生產的煤油，煤炭和鋼鐵等物，如果要蘇聯大量接濟德國以這類原料，勢必變動她本國社會的分配程序，這決非一時所能奏效；而且對於蘇聯的生產和國防計劃，更有相當關係；加以近來蘇聯也感覺人力和物力的困難。其决，運輸的能力也是不夠：德蘇間的運輸，現在祗有三條通路，一經過波羅的海，一為黑海和多瑙河的水運，一為通過波蘭的鐵路。波羅的海一年中，僅有一部分時期可以通航，而且又沒有供給大量運輸的設備；通過波蘭的鐵道，因兩國車輛路軌的差異（，暫時不能直達通車，目前正在各目改進中。剩下的祗有黑海和多瑙河間的水道，尚可從事大量運輸。惟據一般估計，德蘇所提高的貿易當為十二萬萬馬克，船舶的運輸量，或許有點不勝負擔。此外如原料的品質問題，貨價的償付問題，也都足以成為新商的實行上的一些障礙。</p>
<p>這樣看來，僅祗一個德蘇商務協定，似乎還不足表示兩國的結合如何堅强：也還不足以促使歐戰局勢，隨時發生變化。不過因這一商務協定的出現，勢必要使歐洲政治經濟的鬥爭，愈趨激烈；將來一幕一幕的新花樣，也許更要層出不窮，這又是歐戰局勢，將由軍事方面擴張到經濟方面加强鬥爭的先聲了！</p>

<p>總董回滬簽字在即</p>
<p>大陸報云、關於「上海特別警局」之越界築路協定、在本週內簽字之可能性、已因工部局總董樊克令昨（十三日）從大連返滬一事而增强、工部局總辦兼總裁費利浦星期一日否認報載協定之條件時、已證實是項協定、不久即將簽字、按與工部局接近之非官塲方面、前已傳出關於越界築路警權之協定、業已商妥、將於樊克令因事赴大連一行、歷時十日後返滬時簽字之說、該協定要點、規定成立聯合警務力、定名為「上海特別警局」、其警務長由一上海市府」委派、工部局則委派副警務長、</p>

<h3>物價威脅民生　臻嚴重階段　米麵昨又激漲　燃料前途可慮</h3>
<p>滬市物價昂貴、已入嚴重階段、各方一致予以重視、春節開市後、米煤兩項、繼續上漲、市民生計、實已處於無法維持之境地、各公團咸備為關切、本市第一特區市民聯合會、以民食燃料兩項關係民生最切、決請民食調節協會、籌集公款、擴大平糶範圍、一面對於洋米、仍樅續訂購、蓋目前洋米雖貴、但米　演展、殊難逆料、設洋米有充實購備、對於抑平價格、必有良好影響、該會希望各大工廠公司行號及有資力之家庭、咸能參加訂購洋米、以為儲備、留國米與平民零糶、此際實應提倡有錢人吃貴米、無錢人吃平米、有錢人勿應再與無錢人爭食、該會對於集團購煤、鑒於煤價之嚴重、亦擬聯合各公團籌議、見諸實行、以解救足生、滬市物價騰貴、原因不一、而淪陷區域物產被脅制、交通機嘛被操縱、或沿途截留、或重征苛稅、實為主要因素、各方對於此點、一致殷望租界當局站在地方行政當局立塲、努力有以善其後、</p>
<p>洋米到五十元大關</p>
<p>米業市塲前日開市後、售價已較休市前飛漲六七元、乃昨日開盤、洋米等又復在漲二元、最高售至五十元大關、最低四十七元六角、與限價之國米超出十元（實際已差十六元）、允為歷來所未見、租界當局前因洋米須結外匯、價格靡定、故當限價時、對洋秈未加規定、現售洋米、在國米限價前僅售卅九元、歷時未久、竟造成如此局面、故當局經各界之敦促後、已密切注意、研究預防、必要時、決採更有效辦法、惟市民希望當局組織物價評定委員會、對於日用物品、按週評議、使市民得以維持生活、</p>
<p>麵粉漲價動輒元計</p>
<p>其他雜糧、如麵粉、春節時僅售十元至十一元、昨暗盤亦在漲二元半、而達十三元六七角、此種漲風、更為創聞、蓋戰前僅售一元七角許、縱使漲價僅數分、除非市塲有劇烈演變、始略有較大之漲跌、然亦僅一二角而已、乃今非惟有漲無跌、目恒在一二元之多、他如小麥黃荳、以需要激增、亦比例在漲、迄無止境、因米麥售價之飛漲、粥飯麵點等、凡以糧食為原料者、共漲價决數、幾已無從計數、而酒類方於十一月間加價二成、昨日中西各項酒類又吿漲價、菉荳燒漲二成、紹酒燒酒漲三成至四成、平均各貨之售價、較戰前漲至二倍以上、其他洋酒、因運輸困難、到貨稀少、外匯飛漲、其漲風更甚於此、</p>
<p>平糶施飯急不及待</p>
<p>各界發起之平糶委員會、自上年十二月廿一至二月五日開辦平糶後、升斗小民、莫不歌頌、旋以總結束時期、暫吿停止、該會自籌募基金以來、各界捐助、異常踴躍、而自平糶暫停後、鑒於日來米價之在漲、平民生計益難維持、各委員為此、定本星期內召開全體大會、商討繼續平糶事宜、惟外間傳言、定於廿三日起、委託原有米行、恢復平糶、尚無確息、蓋正式日期、須經會議決定、而手續亦繁、但為期當不在遠、又救世軍自開始流動施賑熱飯以來、經過成績頗為優良、該軍因鑒於目前本埠物價飛漲、漫無止境、貧民營生維艱、特繼續舉辦兩月、自十三日晚間起、商同工部局警務處、改在法租界寗波路西新橋、及英租界虞洽卿路北段自來火公司門前兩處、固定地點、於下午六時半起、施賑熱飯、秩序方面、由該軍馬瑞山中佐及杜保田中校等設法維持、頗為良好、每日所發數額、總在三千包以上、</p>

<p>昨有大批洋米繼續到滬、除法輪運來三萬九千一百包、已誌昨報外、意輪哈瑪拉雅號、方自西貢裝四千噸、的計四萬零數百包、亦巳於昨日午前、與法輪前後進口、同靠於虹口順泰碼頭、現正起卸中、兩輪合計裝來洋米八萬包之鉅、</p>
<p>外報對煤　價之觀察</p>
<p>大陸報云、本市某主要煤商昨日（十三日）聲稱、本市煤斤極感短缺、為一九一四年世界大戰以來所未有、如煤價照現況續漲、則不久將超過上决大戰時所創每噸三百五十元之最高紀錄、約</p>
<p>三個月前</p>
<p>烟煤每噸售百元至一百十元、舊曆新年內、突漲至一百八十元左右、市況既無改善之望、則料此後數週內、其價將破每噸二百元關、即煤球市價、亦巳達每噸百元、而硬煤於已往三個月來、亦已騰貴、現有市價、為鴻基煤每噸一百四十元、煤價</p>
<p>高漲原因</p>
<p>如次、（一）往時本市所需煤斤、的有十分之二、來自由東與基隆、今該兩地產煤、已改運日本、（二）歐亞兩洲有戰事、運煤來滬之船隻乃見減少、致運費日高、（三）印度產煤、改運歐洲、以供協的國之用、故印度亦感煤荒、（四）華幣匯率低落、歐戰行將爆發時、上海仍能以五十元購得印煤一噸、據但</p>
<p>業中人談</p>
<p>去年煤業、多有盈餘、即如義泰興、營業極盛、贏利雖不若外傳之鉅、亦頗可觀、但尚係隨購隨賣、而去年業中之獲利最鉅者、厥為進貨久不出手、至最近總結賬始脫手之煤號、其利益之鉅、有不可以數計者、</p>

<p>（二）結論</p>
<p>查商團之各項任務以及各級團員之成績、已於前文詳述、此等工作、對於維持租界之治安秩序、裨益匪淺、當無疑義、團部雖盡力避免在辦公時間內、召集志願團員、但各團員之職業、仍不免大受牽制、尤以司令官、執行官及團佐為然、若輩官佐、恒有重要職業、而其在商團力方面之工作、因避免總動員而頓見繁重、志願司令官之困難、曾經考量、由此引起招募問題、凡人數足額之各隊、其司令官召集隊員較容易、但缺額愈多者、召集愈難、此為關於招募問題最堪注重之一層、司令部欲竭力招募身體强壯之外僑加入商團、雇主方面之合作、尤為重要、此事已見進步、有若干行家、業已採取切實措置、但其結果不甚滿意、緣各行家之有職員加入商團者、僅屬於一種國籍、各該行家　受國際狀况之影響較深、若輩職員對於商團、已負重大任務、其效果深為商團所贊許、然而非俟一切外商行家、不問任何國籍、一律派員加入商團之時、其結果不能認為滿意、往年離滬之靑年、為數不多、但今後將有較多靑年、歐參戰而離開本埠是以身體强壯之僑民、無論其資格如何、亟應獲得若干軍訓常職、至於商行中主要雇員問題、當可由商團職員與司令官、妥善解決、若輩官員即屬於主要雇員者、為數頗多、對於此項問題所含困難及克制方法、深為明瞭、商團和方面希望工部局於一九四〇年間獲得各有關係之雇主之充分合作、俾此項緊急問題得告解決、（完）</p>

<h3>糧食　西貢米開至五十元　洋米限價之說漲勢稍殺　厚薄稻暗盤又升二三元</h3>
<p>米市自紅盤突呈未有之漲風後、昨晨初、一般客販、見內地來源依然寥落、祗到丹陽白元三四車、故尚有餘波、喊聲續昂、然此後洋米乘高拋出頗湧、零躉不及銷納、立呈供過於求、人心退縮、鮮有進辦、市面即呈疲象、惟厚薄稻猶以市上仍無做開、祇塲外暗盤交易、聞又升二三元不等、白元貨稀銷暢、猛提二元左右、</p>
<p>洋米投機之在熱、初不為外滙放長所遏止、市場中買氣更濃、晨間　　西　開價後逐步升高至五十元、比之前日晨市四十八元之價又昂二元、較前日下午公開價亦高一元、軍氣甚旺、施以市塲當局有洋米限價五十元之宣示、漲風稍定，午後定貨價已經報小、行囤納胃轉懈、一號西貢頓自五十元回小至四十九元、二號西貢自四十九元小至四十七元六角、火絞大絞及東京砶尖混合碎情行、悉屬相彷、</p>

<h3>證券　內債空方　漸有抵補　外股買戶轉稀</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市況、趨勢漸有起色、因空方　有抵補，人心稍堅、市上乃由盛傳中美新借軟巳經成立之說、但賣方亦未見示弱、微聞亦有所本、收盤時賣氣允湧、如德孚久豐等頗有脫手、買方轉見稀少、市價結果了戊　種略小五　分一角、餘尚回好二三角、成交數的五十萬元、茲列簡表於後、</p>

<h3>洋股超過票面多至七八倍　投機者不知何心</h3>
<p>閱前日本報商業新聞欄中心危君一文、頗曉興趣、溯自去年九月、歐戰爆發、一度趨向　落之上海市面、漸見好轉、蓋因以前逃避之資金、重返上海、以致游資充斥、造成股票物品之投機在然、良以世　自由市塲、舍美國紐約而外、當以上海為遠東之集中地點、物品投機、尚受社會指摘、故股票買賣、飛黃騰達、茲將數種常見股票述其股份及面額與市價之比較如下、</p>
<p>上述各項股票市價、除四海保險在票面之下外、其餘均超出票面、多至七八倍者、雖各公司營業情形、財政狀態、各有不同、惟股票抬至高價、終覺危險、誠如心危君所言、高價股票在手未　售者、則前途變幻莫測、夜長夢多、不可不加汪意耳、（劍瑛）</p>
<h3>外幣不絕出籠</h3>
<p>昨日外幣　因政府有維持外滙之訊、港電供給頻仍　潛勢鬆軟、英灸金鎊、供求見稀、金票獲利傾吐不絕、晨間美票降為十三元八角七分、中途變動狹隘、晚市為十三元九角二分、英票為五十一元七角五分、港票等供求未盛、市價多數穩定、新加坡票稍有供給、坎票斐律濱票、納胃呆滯、日金票需要甚殷、市價挺秀、晚市為一元二角九分半、朝鮮票晚市亦升為一元零五分、昨日市價、英金票降二角五分、美金票降四分、坎票降一角、新加坡斐律濱票、俱降五分、其他各幣未更、</p>
<h3>紗花　空頭翻多　紗市欲跌反漲　結果漲起十餘元</h3>
<p>紗市始跌繼漲、趨勢堅挺、蓋以一般拋空戶、被環境所迫、業已忍痛抵補、而實需沉寂如恒、二期紗成交特別興旺、市塲熱鬧不堪、此緣投機者紛紛活動、檯面上之鋒俏、泰半昔日之空頭、現在由空悉多、且一部份抬高收進、所以滙市雖寗靜、漲勢尚熾也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開因外滙平靜面勿動、同時外棉下挫、人心尚和平、開價即跌五六元、旋以有　部份心思看好、仍然買進、加之空方活動抵補、於是漲風頓熾、步步上升、漲出八百元關外、二十支雙馬最高價曾達八百〇六元、收盤略回下、查半日間成交統計三千一百包、行情二十支雙馬漲十元、組紗漲十餘元、廠方出永安廠開出二十支特金城三百包、價為七百九十元至八百元、茲將各帮口冒去之額量分列如左、</p>
<h3>印棉廉於美棉　存貨搜買一空</h3>
<p>本棉交易較少、但人心因紗市良好而甚堅、廠方需要不暢、不過日廠稍有動辦、所以市價殊昂、蘇北來源未見、現棉成交情形錄左、</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐約棉市、　初先因投機者之賣出及孟買來電低落、略跌三五磅音、後因海外商之在市賣出、及多頭了結、結果收盤價格較之上日跌落近期小十二磅音、遠期小十七磅音、印度連同項測跌二羅比餘，埃及漲二十餘磅音、利物浦跌十餘便士、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日因紗　猛騰、棉花頗形熱鬧、然廠方則購意較為淡薄、不若同業之烈也昨日交易、同業對於現貨大量收購、日來因印棉較美棉為廉、故市上印棉存貨幾被收買空也、昨日成交之印棉、其的有四十包之數、茲將昨日棉市以美匯七元一二五折合送廠價如下、</p>
<h3>煤炭　煤球又漲六元　—第担六元二角—</h3>
<p>煤球行情、因原料煤屑來源稀少、水脚飛漲、本埠難有兩萬餘噸存貨、但因各工廠改用用白煤屑、紛起吸收、以致暗盤迭俏、今晨南洋國華·義泰興等煤球廠盤又漲六元、計開同業自車每噸一百十六元、送到一百十八元、水街鬥莊、每担六元二角</p>
<h3>疋頭　布價愈抬愈高</h3>
<p>布價續趨上騰、緣以本街同業及染廠奮力買進、人心激昂、各貨售盤、有漲無跌、較前日每疋又漲一角至五角、同業向綸昌廠開進羽綢·貢緞　嗶嘰·等深色貨一百餘相、向怡和廠開進九磅至十六磅各檔粗布一千餘包、染廠購進府綢·色丁·斜紋·花布坯一萬餘疋、本街批發號購進組布·斜紋·漂染布三百餘件、客帮現銷均乏躉批成交、</p>
<p>東而白貨漲風續熾、頻創新高價、昨龍頭細布現貨晨開二十五元五角、後市因北帮進肖仍旺、愈抬愈昂、現盤增至二十五元八角牛、本月期貨喊　十六元二角半、市氣蓬勃、大有漲無止境之慨、全日天津帮及秦皇島帮辦進細布細斜又達一千餘左右、本街同業與染廠辦細布為多數、行開下月份期貴細布細斜、亦有一千餘件、龍頭最高價做出一十六元匕角半、中檔各牌亦　廿六元</p>
<h3>藥材　三柰良姜苦杏二　元一不貴</h3>
<p>苦杏仁市存不厚、首盤開一百三十元、普通　百二十五元、後市尚看冉緊、</p>
<p>三奈統市存底不滿百包、故首市較去臘猛升七元、據汕頭函訊、劃申成本、須現鈔五十四元、勢將續升、</p>
<p>良姜小只、存底最缺、大只中只市存雖有、數亦不多，故昨市比大結束前又升五六元、</p>

<h3>提携監犯</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉音</p>
<p>對於因生活的壓迫而犯罪的人，單單處以刑罰是無補於事的，這我們已經再三提出申述過。</p>
<p>他在社會上，好像羽毛未豐的小烏。你把他抓來了，訓責他，體罰他，把他監禁了，刑滿以後，便把他放出去。他在監牢裏，不但未受到合理的教育與職業的訓練，有時候反而受具他囚犯不合理的思想與惡劣習慣的沾染，出來以後，羽毛還是一樣未豐。你希望他能遠走高飛，那怎麼可能呢？</p>
<p>結果一減一還是等於一，成為現社會問題中的一筆糊塗賬。</p>
<p>其實這一筆賬本身並不糊塗，是我們的糊塗。我們不曾眞眞地把他減去。</p>
<p>我們的社會不但不曾引導他走上正路，還是迫着他走上不得小犯罪的路。</p>
<p>據我們看，這種提携囚犯的工作，是刻不容緩的。而担負這種重大責任的機關，在上海，沒有再比兩租界當局更適合的了。把兩租界稅收的一部份，為扶持不幸的囚犯，使入正途的經費，該也是合理的。</p>
<p>公共和界不是有一個保障兒童福利的機關嗎？當局眼光的遠大是值得讚許的。如果是可能的話，我們希望兩租界當局冉來一個都助監犯解決他們的個人，以及家庭生活問題的機關。這種事雖是麻煩而不容易辦得好的，可是我們以為無為如何值得一試，是得可償失的。在目前，當局也許得多付出一筆開支，可是將來的警備費用，也許可以因此而減省多多呢！</p>
<p>心理</p>
<h3>胆怯的孩子</h3>
<p>— 放任</p>
<p>媽媽！我不高興一個人到樓上去，燈也沒有開着！」每天晚上，在成千的屋子裏，孩子們都那樣嚷着。</p>
<p>也許你要說：：「什麼，孩子們肌怯也要我們做父母的想辦法嗎？」</p>
<p>下而是心理學者的一些建議，竟美並不新奇，但保證可以帮助你們。不妨試着看一看</p>
<p>孩子們所有的肌法，除極少的幾種屬於自然的之外，大率都是小心靈裏的毒苗。既是他們個性上危險的弱點，也是他們精神不健全的前驅。不可不糾正，不可不治療。</p>
<p>胆法的孩子，切忌刺激。譬如他怕黑暗，斷不可把他關在暗幸中，再用鬼怪來嚇他，因為這種鼓勵是無效果可言的</p>
<p>孩子們所以胆怯，不敢置身於某種塲會，其實際的主因，也許祇為他不曾準備好去做。假令你的孩子不敢和別的孩子玩某種遊戲，你就該引他到一旁，吿訴他一些怎樣玩的方法，他一定高興了，因為他已有較好的把握。</p>
<p>譬如你的孩子因某决被風吹倒而怕風，你就該教他如何站穩，指點他如何正面着風向，如何低垂他的頭部。經此教訓後，他一定不怕風無疑。</p>
<p>還有一個很微妙的方法，那就是心理學家所謂「反刺激」。譬如說你的孩子不敢到地窖裏去，『理由』是他害怕潛伏在暗角裏的鬼怪。但如你的孩子也酷愛菓子，而他的母親已有一籃最好的菓子藏在地窖中最黑暗的一角，那他就會偷偷地溜下去了。第一次既無任何可怕的事遇到，第二次的肌子也就史寬，而所謂鬼怪者也仍無活動。不久之後，有鬼怪的意念自然完全消減。你懂得這個意思嗎？</p>
<p>小孩們最大的肌法問題便是自感種種不足，以為自己並不能和別的人一般。這在心理學上叫做『自卑心理』。這種心理，乃是種種肌法心理的綜合物，它足使小孩們永為『自嘆勿如』的煩惱所籠罩，奄奄無生氣。假使你覺得你的孩也有此種情形，你就該設法帮助他，使他對於自身估計的抬高。你應該竭力讚賞他的成功，承認他所已解決的問題。對於他的缺點，應指示他些端倪，讓他可以更正。</p>
<p>小孩如害怕某一事物，你應詳細解釋給他聽。曾經有一小孩害怕火車頭，因為他常見它開行時猝發着蒸汽。但經他母親說明了蒸汽是什麽，又舉茶爐等做例子後，那小孩便由怕火車頭一變而為愛火車頭了</p>
<p>小孩們應有機會和他的朋友作種種戶外或室內遊戲。這是小孩們的社交生活。從這種生活中，他們可獲得一種免除種種胆法的結果。吾則，胆怯隨時間而擴大，將使孩子們受累無窮了。</p>
<p>科學</p>
<h3>輸血眞相</h3>
<p>— 洪興熾</p>
<p>一月三十日竺迅先生大作「賣血的生活」，敘述一個出賣其血液，以供醫院輸血之傷心人，原意無非表明其所見人生之悲慘。然則以科學的立塲說起來，賣血並不有傷人道，恐讀者對於賣血一事有所誤解，而引起不良之印象，故不辭賽蛇添足之嫌，而對輸血一事，略加以說明。</p>
<p>以醫學上之輸血原理說起來，一個健全的人，如果在片刻之間抽出五百立方生的米達（立糎）之血液，決無有害之影響，而其身體中製造血液之機關，立即開始補充工作，在數小時至一日之間，即恢復其原有之血液量。普通每次施行輸血，並無超出五百立糎之多的情形。可見輸血對於供給血液的人，在事實上絕無損害。</p>
<p>或者以為有錢人可以出錢向別人買血液，則有錢人可買血液以補自己身體，天下寗有此等殘酷事乎？此乃一種謬見。要知輸血並不能使一個原來健康之人有延長生命之益，不過能使一個失血甚多，或陷於極度衰弱時之病人，獲一種急救之功効而巳。</p>
<p>一個失血甚多，或陷於衰弱之人，如果以由他人身上輸入之血液來維持其身內的需要，事實上數十至數百立糎是無濟於事的。據最近醫學原理上所知，病人當輸入小量血液之後，共體內木來已陷於工作不力的造血機關（主要的如肝，骨髓等），受到一種刺激，立刻加緊其工作，從事於努力造血之効能。所以輸入之血液不過使其身體內受到刺激而生効能，並非以血液供其應用也。</p>
<p>上述原理，雖係專門學識，然每易使人誤解，殊有使人人知曉之必要。觀乎歐美各國有不少願以義務供給輸血之人，在醫院中登記。而我國科學落後，淺近之常識，尚且有人瞠目不知，殊難怪目輸血為悲劇也。</p>
<h3>儲血銀行</h3>
<p>— 莫名</p>
<p>前本刊所戰之竺迅君「賣血的生活」一文，頗為動人，唯一般國人對於輸血一事，認識常有錯誤。就個人而言，輸血可說是一種拾己救人的義勇行為，絕不可以普通的賣買勾當目之，而且一個健康的人損失若干血液，並不至於發生軍大的影饗。至於要學上，輸血更是一種合理合法的行為，本埠中華醫學會且有輸血服務社的正式組織。最近國外有　種「儲血銀行」出現，可說是最進步最完善的輸血辦法，特介紹於决。</p>
<p>「儲血銀行』是芝加哥一家鄉村醫院創辦的新花樣，它使輸血救急這件事大大的簡便化起來。一個病人需要輸血的時候，可以不必「臨時抱佛脚」，急念忙忙地找願意或適宜的輸血者，現在新鮮的血液可以妥藏在冰箱中，經數星期不至變壞，而且『銀行』中可以保存各型的血液（按人血分三型，不能混淆），以應各型的需要，無須再經檢查。</p>
<p>一個病人倘若要施行大手術，那麼他可以在一二星期之前存入一品脫的自己血液，以備萬一救急之用。一個健康的孕婦，最好在預測分娩的時日之前一二星期，儲蓄二〇　一〇〇西西的血液；倘若到了那時自己用不着，還可以轉讓給他人。病人並可以向『銀行』暫借血液用，等恢復健康後再將自己的血液抽出來去償還。有許多傳染病如猩紅熱等的痊愈者的血液，可以醫治　樣病症的患者，「儲血銀行」對於這方面，也都能十足供應。</p>
<p>戰爭</p>
<h3>戰時的英國</h3>
<p>— 雲痕</p>
<p>第二次歐洲大戰爆發到現在，差不多將達五個月了：雖然除掉海上的戰爭點綴外，陸上可說至今沒有大規模的襲擊，但是戰時的英國人民却已感到戰爭的影響。</p>
<p>所得稅向為每鎊五先令六便士，在今年兀且起增至七先令六便士，所以在戰前一個已結婚有三個小孩的人，假使每年收入三百五十鎊，可以不必納稅，現在也要納五鎊十二先令的所得稅。</p>
<p>英國在戰前儲蓄的糧食，械為豐富，所以至今沒有像德國那樣實施按口計糧，不過據說牛油和鹹肉的供給，不久也要實施這種制度，以免囤積居奇。</p>
<p>倫敦熱鬧市區的居民，都巳疏散到鄉間去，因此四郊的商店生意興隆，大發利市；而市鎮上商店則零落異常。</p>
<p>戰時的英國，在下午五時三刻起實行燈火管制，日落以後，全市寂靜，如無特別要事，均居家讀書，以作消遺。如出外，則携手電筒，因此手電筒與乾池價格的高漲，極為驚人。</p>
<p>英國本是鎮定的民族，戰時也是靜靜的，等待着希特勒主義的滅亡。</p>
<h3>英倫新景</h3>

<h3>外僑影業團體慶祝　電影五十週紀念</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>—攝取來賓影片次日開映—</p>
<p>電影在今日，雖已風行到全世界每一個角落裏，但嚴格的說來，就像美國是一個電形的先進國家，也還祇有短短五十年的歷史。直到一八九一年，美國才有第一部正式的影片公映，因此，到今年恰是電影的五十週年紀念。</p>
<p>就為了今年是電影的五十週年紀念，本市外僑方面，將由電影藝術協會發起，假座一家外人經營的舞廳，舉行慶祝。一切計畫，正在進行之中。照目前我們所得到的消息，這慶祝會將於下月舉行，期凡叫日，不渦舉行的日期，還沒有確定。在上海的電影史上，這樣的慶祝，又將造成一頁新的紀錄了。</p>
<p>這一次的慶祝，由歐美各國影片公司駐滬經理處，協同進行。照預定的計畫，在四天之中，最初的兩夜，所有在那舞廳中的賓客，將逐一攝人電影機，這種影片，在來後的兩夜，就可在同一地點放映，這樣來賓都可在銀慕上面看見自己的影像。</p>
<p>所有的活動影片，在舞塲中攝得的，將悉數送往好萊塢一家大影片公司去。一切手統，早已和那一家影片公司的駐滬辦事處接洽妥當了。同時，所有的來賓，攝人電影機之後，都有得獎的希望。評選的標準，就在擇取誰是最適於攝上銀幕，以及誰的面孔和好萊塢某一大明星的面孔最像。這的確也是一件很有趣味的事情呢</p>
<h3>關於「小人國」的小統計</h3>
<p>— 保羅</p>
<p>「小天國」是繼「白雪公主」以後第二部完成的五彩卡通長片，不渦牠的製作人不是華德狄斯耐而是麥克茀來許。劇情是採取史惠富的格立佛遊記而攝成的，這一部影片，在攝製的技巧和演出的詼諧幽默上，實在比「白雪公生為高，現已定今日起在大光明和大上海兩家電影院同時開映，與上海覜衆相見的時日，已在目前了。</p>
<p>下面是關於小人國」製作方面的小統計：</p>
<p>「小人國」令片由七百多畫師工作一年半，方始完成。</p>
<p>「小人國」全片共需圖畫八萬六千張，每張需九星期，方可完成。</p>
<p>一小人國全片共用去顏料十　噸圖畫紙　六噸</p>
<p>「小人國一全片若由一個畫師全力製造，需時一萬五千年，方始可以完成</p>
<p>「小人國」全片共需五十萬個動作。</p>
<h3>「文素臣」雜談</h3>
<p>— 抱殘</p>
<p>英雄美人的傳奇故事；妤像永遠合於上海人的興味，「文素臣」平劇在舞台上的受歡迎，幾乎就像是一個寄蹟。它的搬上銀幕，從營業主義上說來，當然也是「勢所必至」的了。</p>
<p>常影「文素臣」的女主角，也就是平劇中的主角，名優王熙春；而平劇作者朱覺厂，原來也就是電影的編劇者朱石麟，駕輕就熟，自然容易討好，所以「文素臣」影片公映，一樣博得了觀衆的愛好。現在二集「文索臣」也將在新光獻映了。</p>
<p>電影裏的文素臣一校是湖海飄游，到處受着女子垂靑的英雄。第二集裏就父有兩個美人兒愛他；不過文素臣的格，已經田劇作者塑造成一個為公忘私的奇士，慷慨激昂的成份多，風流旖旎的成份少。有一件事值得一提，這就是二集「文素臣　裏，新星林紅玉的發見。她很好看，雖然是處女作，可以看出她表演的天才。前途未可限量。王熙　還是楚楚動人，劉瓊做戲的機會似更多些。大的因為有觀衆，據說合衆公司正在請朱石麟計劃開拍「文素臣」第三集。</p>

<p>貫李合唱搜孤，於打鞭一手不自滿意，是知其難而又謙虛也。夫天下事，知難行易，既知之矣，總有日至於精妙，是在勤研究苦練習，大家共勉可也。與此相類者尚有打姪上墳之三板子，亦難打難挨者也，打姪上墳又名狀元譜，吾於民初習此劇於北平老伶工陳福勝先生，又就正於陳彥衡先生，據說老譚與王桂官（字楞仙）合演，陳伯玉待板打姪一塲一個會打，一個會挨，稱為　絕，與譚賈合唱搜孤之打鞭子同妙，無人能及，彥衡每言至此當　嘖贊嘆，吾雖知打法意旨，然缺少常期練習，偶於排戲時持大板作勢，所打者乃指導人或空氣，恨無會挨之小生如王桂官其人者，犧牲髀股，實地挨吾三下，以試試吾會打吾也。事有湊巧，說來可笑，今之名小生俞振飛確曾在台上挨過吾三下板子，讀者中不知有見過者吾？事在十年前，戲為義務戲，地點在大舞臺，吾同振飛合演此戲，未唱之前，排過一二次，彼時振飛尚未北上，研究亂彈戲不久，及到臺上唱，吾扮陳伯玉，他扮陳大官，吾打得如何，他挨得如何，今隔十年，都不記憶矣。振飛北上數載，拜程繼仙為師，想他這齣狀元譜，必有精深研究及經驗，吾父恨不得再同他合演一同也。</p>

<p>「你為什麽不上學校去，匹諾丘？」仙子問他。　小木偶說了一大篇謊話想騙仙子。天哪，他的本來很長的鼻子現在變得更長史難看了。仙子道；「嘿，你還要說謊嗎？」匹諾丘只得說了實話，求仙子放他回家去，他決意要做一個好孩子了。藍色仙子的魔杖觸着烏　門上的鎖，鎖便開了。放出木偶，她便隱去。現在匹諾丘又恢復自由了。（四）</p>

<h3>The Chinese Army Advances Fiercely Towards Wuyuan, Western Sui Japanese Forces Waver On All Fronts, The Chinese Army Recaptures Yangba Town and Enters Linhe County, Two Thousand Japanese Soldiers Annihilated, Remnants Retreating Towards Wuyuan</h3>
<p>A Certain Place in Western Sui: The Japanese forces that invaded Western Sui from Baotou in separate routes were intercepted by the Chinese army along the way, resulting in thousands of casualties. By the 9th, it was determined that the Japanese forces had been drawn into the border area of Sui Ning, with only over ten thousand men and over a thousand vehicles remaining. The Chinese army, seeing that the opportunity had arrived, launched a fierce attack that day. After a day of intense fighting, Huangyangmutou (southwest of Linhe) was recaptured. The Japanese forces intercepted west and south of that location were determined to be completely annihilated that day. Starting on the 11th, bloody battles continued. The Chinese army advanced fiercely towards Linhe and Wuyuan in separate directions. The Japanese forces also resisted desperately. Intense fighting occurred everywhere from Shanba, northwest of Linhe, to Wuzhen, northeast of Wuyuan. The exhausted Japanese forces gradually became unable to withstand the pressure. Reinforcements were sent again from Baotou, but they were intercepted by the large Chinese army at Dazidian, on the eastern section of the Wuyuan highway in the foothills of the Ula Mountains, and in the vicinity of Lhasa to the south, and completely defeated. The various Chinese armies deployed along the Yellow River also advanced simultaneously in separate routes, attacking the flanks of the Japanese forces. As a result, the Japanese forces that had penetrated deep into Western Sui, attempting to occupy the Hetao region behind the Yellow River, were trapped in the Chinese iron-clad encirclement. They had no way to escape, and as they were attacked, they shrank further and further. By the evening of the 12th, the Japanese front lines wavered completely. The Chinese army fought even more bravely and recaptured Shanba. They also wiped out the remaining Japanese forces along the Wu Shan Highway, Taihe Tang Highway Bureau, Baichuanbu, Sanhechang and other places without leaving any survivors. Taking advantage of their victory, they advanced fiercely to encircle the enemy. By the morning of the 13th, they had annihilated a concentrated force of Japanese troops on the Linhe to Wuyuan line. It was estimated that 120 Japanese vehicles were destroyed, many supplies were seized, and over two thousand Japanese soldiers were killed. The battle is still ongoing. (Dispatch from the 14th)</p>
<p>Ningxia: The four thousand or so remnants of the Japanese army, driven to Linhe by the various routes of the Chinese army, held Linhe on the evening of the 12th, still putting up a desperate struggle. However, the Chinese army was unstoppable and attacked bravely. That night, they stormed into Linhe city and engaged in fierce street fighting with the Japanese forces. The Japanese forces were unable to withstand the onslaught and retreated in disarray towards Wuyuan. The Chinese army is currently pursuing and annihilating the fleeing Japanese troops while intensifying the search and elimination of the few Japanese troops hiding in the city. It has now been confirmed that over six hundred Japanese corpses were abandoned by the Japanese army in the suburbs of Linhe, along with one hundred and ninety-six damaged vehicles. Various military supplies are piled up like mountains. The Japanese army was unable to transport them in time, and they all fell into the hands of the Chinese. (Dispatch from the 14th)</p>

<p>Chongqing: A well-informed responsible person from the Chinese side met with a Reuters reporter this morning to review the Guangxi campaign. He stated that the purpose of the Japanese commander in the Guangxi campaign was indeed to inflict a devastating blow on the main force of the Chinese side in the area. The offensive plan implemented by the Japanese army in Guangxi was similar to the strategy adopted by the German army in Poland, namely, to carry out rapid flanking and encirclement maneuvers and to penetrate deep into the enemy's rear lines. The Japanese army hoped to annihilate the trapped Chinese army. The victory of the Chinese counter-offensive relied on two points: (1) The Chinese army, although surrounded by the Japanese army, still had the ability to hold its ground; (2) The ability of the Chinese reinforcements to arrive at the designated positions in the rear of the Japanese army and carry out counter-encirclement and flanking maneuvers. The Chinese army executed the orders of the Chinese commander with great precision, holding Kunlun Pass south of Binyang, while the several Chinese armies ordered to attack the rear of the Japanese army arrived at their designated locations as planned. The Japanese army in the Binyang area, realizing its dangerous position, quickly retreated. If the Japanese army had continued to advance north, they would have had little chance of escaping the Chinese encirclement. However, even as the Japanese army suddenly retreated to the southwest, they were attacked from all sides by the Chinese army and suffered heavy losses. (Reuters dispatch from the 14th)</p>
<p>London: Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, recently received a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government of China stating, "According to the war report from Guangxi Province, since our army launched a counter-offensive on the 9th of this month, it has inflicted a heavy blow on the enemy. As a result of two days of intense fighting near Shanglin, no less than four thousand four hundred enemy soldiers were annihilated by our side.

<h3>The Japanese Government Plans to Increase Coal Production During Wartime</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry convened a provincial conference at 9:30 AM on the 14th to establish a wartime coal production increase plan. Minister of Commerce Fujiwara and other top officials attended. Based on the original draft of the Fuel Bureau, they made final agreements and decided on a total subsidy plan of 110 million yuan. The above-mentioned funds will be used as additional budget for the 15th fiscal year, with the aim of submitting it to the Diet by the end of this month. Therefore, official negotiations with the Ministry of Finance will begin today. The plan aims to increase coal production by 6 million tons compared to the highest coal production in the years of Showa 13 and 14. However, in order to achieve the wartime low price policy, it was decided not to raise the unit price, that is, to limit it to the current unit price. A summary of the plan is as follows: (1) Increased Production Award Fund: A subsidy of 5 yuan will be given for each ton of coal produced. The budget for this item is 30 million yuan. (2) Tunneling Subsidy: A subsidy of 50 yuan will be given for each meter of tunneling, regardless of whether it is for new mine development or re-tunneling in old mines (equivalent to one-half to one-third of the tunneling cost). The total budget for this item is 20 million yuan. (3) Guarantee Fund for the "Coal Cooperative Sales Company": This is to guarantee the "Coal Cooperative Sales Company" to stabilize prices and control losses from sales. That is, the government will guarantee 3 to 5 yuan per ton of losses caused by purchasing from the industry at the current unit price to a sufficient extent. The quantity of coal purchased is over 10 million tons, and the cost is 60 million yuan. (4) Production Materials: For the coal increase industry, a principle of 100% priority allocation will be implemented. (5) Labor: The same as with the allocation of materials, absolute priority measures will be implemented. (Allied News Agency dispatch from the 14th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The German-Soviet Union Sign a Business Agreement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Moscow and Berlin simultaneously released announcements, declaring that the new German-Soviet Union business agreement had been formally signed. The content of the agreement is said to stipulate that the Soviet Union will exchange raw materials for German industrial products, and increase the quantity of trade between the two parties. Under the current international situation, the establishment of this agreement naturally has extremely great significance; but we do not know if, after the signing of the agreement, it will still be followed by a scene of spring clouds unfolding. It is remembered that last August, after Germany and the Soviet Union concluded a credit loan agreement, the two countries immediately signed a non-aggression pact; a few days later, Germany immediately ignited a fire in Eastern Europe, and the Soviet Union also followed by sending troops into Poland, gradually developing into today's Second European War. Taking this as an example, will Germany and the Soviet Union make some moves in Southeast Europe, either independently or jointly, after the signing of the new commercial agreement? This is indeed something worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>As for the German-Soviet Union business agreement itself, it seems to have two different effects: one political and one economic. From a political perspective: the establishment of this German-Soviet Union business agreement clearly shows the strengthening of the German-Soviet Union alliance; for Britain's attempt to win over Anglo-Soviet Union business relations in order to reduce the Soviet Union's exports to Germany, it is at least a blow. German public opinion generally believes that this move is an economic alliance, which is undoubtedly a nature of demonstrating strength to Britain and France. At the same time, it also contains a bit of a warning meaning for the Balkan Entente countries. Because the Balkan Entente countries are currently discussing mutual assistance methods, and they also have a tendency to express approval for Britain and France's policy of assisting Finland, which cannot but make the Soviet Union dissatisfied.</p>
<p>From an economic perspective: this is certainly a huge harvest for Germany. Since Germany was blockaded by Britain and France, and maritime traffic was cut off, the economic impact it suffered, although not as bad as what outsiders have proclaimed; after the start of the war, its trade with neighboring countries declined less and increased more; but Germany is a highly developed industrial country, and it lacks various major raw materials and food domestically. The severance of maritime trade is ultimately a huge economic threat; and neighboring countries, due to environmental reasons, may not be able to supply its needs as much as possible. For example, Romania's crude oil cannot be exported to Germany in quantities exceeding a certain limit. However, the vast Soviet Union has various rich raw materials; and recently, after several five-year plans, its industrial and agricultural production capacity has increased significantly compared to the past. The greatness of economic power is generally considered by economists to be sufficient to determine the outcome of the world war. For example, crude oil, which Germany urgently needs, the Soviet Union's production volume is second only to the United States, ranking first in the world. Other items such as steel and various other metals and food also have large-scale production. At the same time, the Soviet Union also feels a great need for foreign industrial manufactured goods and machinery. Therefore, the economic state of the Soviet Union is quite suitable for Germany's wartime economic alliance. If Germany and the Soviet Union can earnestly fulfill the business agreement they signed, this is indeed enough to make Britain and France's economic blockade of Germany lose considerable effectiveness.</p>
<p>It is unfair to say to what extent the German-Soviet Union business agreement will proceed in the future, and it is still difficult to judge at present. If both sides have no unexpected problems and are willing to fulfill their treaty obligations. There are also many difficulties: first, does the Soviet Union really have a large amount of raw materials that can be exported to Germany? The main purpose of the first, second and third five-year plans implemented by the Soviet Union in the past ten years is to eliminate dependence on foreign countries; therefore, the production of raw materials and food, and domestic needs, often maintain a balanced state. What we can see in the Soviet Union's foreign trade is: in recent years, the most imported items are machines, steel, rubber, wool, and other items; but on the export side, the most exported items are wood, food, and leather, rather than large-scale production of crude oil, coal, and steel, etc. If the Soviet Union is to supply Germany with these types of raw materials in large quantities, it will inevitably change the allocation procedures of its own country, which is by no means something that can be achieved in a short time; and it has a considerable relationship with the Soviet Union's production and national defense plans; in addition, the Soviet Union has also felt the difficulty of manpower and material resources recently. Secondly, transportation capacity is also insufficient: the transportation between Germany and the Soviet Union now has only three routes, one through the Baltic Sea, one through the Black Sea and the Danube River waterway, and one through the railway in Poland. The Baltic Sea can only be navigated for a part of the year, and it does not have the equipment to supply large-scale transportation; the railway through Poland cannot reach directly due to the difference in vehicle tracks in the two countries (temporarily, and is currently being improved. The remaining waterway is only the waterway between the Black Sea and the Danube River, which can still be used for large-scale transportation. However, according to general estimates, the trade increased by Germany and the Soviet Union will be 1.2 billion marks, and the shipping volume may be a bit overwhelming. In addition, issues such as the quality of raw materials and the payment of prices are all sufficient to become obstacles to the implementation of the new commercial agreement.</p>
<p>In this way, it seems that only a German-Soviet Union business agreement is not enough to show how strong the combination of the two countries is: nor is it enough to promote changes in the European war situation at any time. However, because of the emergence of this business agreement, it is bound to make the political and economic struggle in Europe more intense; new tricks may emerge in endlessly in the future, which is the prelude to the strengthening of the struggle from the military aspect to the economic aspect in the European war situation!</p>
<h3>The US Senate Passes the New Loan Bill to China and Transfers it to the House of Representatives, Hull Opposes Applying the Neutrality Act to the Far East, The Suspension of Silver Purchase Abroad is Temporarily Shelved</h3>
<p>Washington: The US Senate yesterday passed the bill to increase the capital of the Export-Import Bank by US$100 million by a vote of 49 to 27, so that the government can lend to China and Finland. The bill will be sent to the House of Representatives today. (United Press dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>Washington: State Department officials believe that US-Japan relations will become increasingly tense due to the passage of the bill by the US Senate to increase the capital of the Export-Import Bank to lend US$20 million to China and Finland. According to House leaders, the bill will definitely be passed quickly when it is submitted to the House. (United Press dispatch from the 14th)</p>
<p>Washington: Senator Gillette, a key isolationist member of the Democratic Party, submitted a proposal to the Senate, advocating the implementation of the Neutrality Act for the wars between China and Japan. The Senate Procedures Committee is scheduled to submit it for discussion in a short period of time, or even tomorrow. Pittman, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, recently told the press that the State Department does not approve of this proposal. Secretary of State Hull sent a letter to him, explaining the State Department's views on the conflicts between China and Japan, and between Finland and the Soviet Union. The content of this letter is not convenient to disclose. What can be said is that according to Secretary of State Hull, the security and peace of the United States are clearly at risk, so he does not advocate the implementation of the Neutrality Act, so as not to hinder the United States' commercial relations with these countries. It is generally believed that the Senate Procedures Committee will take into account Secretary of State Hull's views during the discussion. (Havas dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>Washington: Senator Townsend, a member of the Republican Party, submitted a bill in the summer of the year to advocate the abolition of the Treasury Department's power to purchase foreign silver. After this bill was reviewed and passed by the members of the Senate Banking Committee yesterday with five votes in favor and zero votes against, it was submitted for discussion by the Banking Committee today. A resolution was immediately passed to postpone the discussion, pending the attendance of representatives from the State Department and the Treasury Department to present explanations on the impact of this bill on US foreign policy and foreign trade. According to the discussion today, the Banking Committee originally planned to review and pass the bill. Senate Democratic Leader Barkley then left the meeting and notified the Treasury Department by telephone. Treasury Secretary Beale immediately expressed his disagreement, saying that it would be appropriate to postpone the discussion. Barkley then conveyed this chapter to the Banking Committee, which then made the above-mentioned decision. After the meeting, Barkley told the press, "The Treasury Department believes that stopping the purchase of foreign silver is sufficient to harm the United States' trade with Latin American countries, especially with Mexico, because our country is taking advantage of the opportunity of the European war to develop trade with Latin American countries and maintain it after the war is over. However, most of the goods purchased by these countries from the United States are paid for in silver. If our country stops purchasing silver, the danger is self-evident." As far as China is concerned, is it not "absurd" to lend money to the country on the one hand and stop purchasing silver from the country at the same time? Generally, it will take at least a week for representatives from the State Department and the Treasury Department to present their opinions to the Banking Committee before things can be discussed. In addition, according to reports from political circles, President Roosevelt himself is opposed to the proposal to stop purchasing foreign silver. Treasury Secretary Beale notified Senate Democratic Leader Barkley of this intention. According to the Banking Committee Chairman Wagner, the Banking Committee decided to discuss Townsend's case from Suili, which means that Congress will not take any action during this session.

<h3>Chinese People All Feel Delighted</h3>
<p>Chongqing: When the Chinese people here heard that the U.S. Senate had approved the proposal to extend credit loans to China, they all felt delighted. While awaiting detailed news, the public believes that this move by the U.S. Senate will have a significant spiritual significance in addition to material assistance for China. People here also believe that the United States, after abolishing the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty, has taken this concrete posture to clearly indicate to Japan that if Japan continues to invade China, the United States will take active measures to assist China.

<h3>U.S. Senate Army and Foreign Affairs Committees Discuss Sanctions Against Japan, Senator Norris Reiterates Call to Expand Scope of Moral Sanctions</h3>
<p>Washington: When the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee convened this morning at 10:30 to deal with various embargo proposals against Japan, several leaders stated that this issue need not be discussed in the near future. Senator Guffey hoped to discuss his bill to implement neutrality laws for both China and Japan, believing it to be a method to resolve the Sino-Japanese War. Senator George advocated for some restrictions on exports to Japan, but believed that this issue still required considerable consideration. According to Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman, before discussing the various embargo drafts, he will ask Secretary of State Hull to express the State Department's views, as the State Department has not yet made a clear statement on this issue. According to political circles, Hull's intention is only to use these sanctions drafts as bargaining chips to force Japan to make concessions in the Far East. (United Press, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington: Senator Fanuoli today again made an appeal to morally sanction Japan. However, it is generally believed that moral sanctions are difficult to implement on the most important point of oil supply. Because the export of military raw materials requires a license from the State Department, moral pressure can be applied. However, oil companies do not require licenses, so it is difficult to exert pressure on oil companies. Furthermore, it is heard that the oil companies' opinions on selling oil to Japan are not as unified as those of aircraft manufacturers. Judging from the current situation, the Senate will proceed cautiously to handle the proposal for the government to formally issue an embargo against Japan. (Reuters, 13th)</p>

<h3>Franco-Japanese Commercial Treaty Nearing Expiration, Japan Eager to Renew</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Tokyo dispatch: The Franco-Japanese Provisional Commercial Treaty, signed on August 19, 1911, and a temporary agreement signed in June 1939, stipulating that it would cease to be effective on March 15 of this year, is only one month away. The Franco-Japanese commercial agreement stipulates that not only trade with France itself, but also trade with Syria, Vietnam, Morocco, Tunisia, Malaya, Somaliland, etc., are within the scope of Franco-Japanese trade. Therefore, all parties feel very uneasy about this matter. After the arrival of Ambassador Sawada to France, he immediately made efforts to sign a new one, but due to the outbreak of the European war and the impact of the Chinese war, the progress of the negotiations was extremely difficult. According to statistics, in the eleven months from January to November last year, Japan exported goods to France worth 58,407,000 yen and imported goods from France worth 41,988,000 yen. Japan needs to rely on France for potassium, Tunisia for salt, Vietnam for scrap iron, Malaya for rubber, and other raw materials for Japanese industry. After the outbreak of the European war, the French government implemented an export certificate system, prohibiting the export of military raw materials from France and its colonies, as France's own needs are also extremely urgent.

<h3>Japanese Young Men Drained, Civilian Life Suffering, Anti-War Sentiment Spreads Across the Country</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: According to a certain foreigner who recently came to Hong Kong from Japan, Japan's domestic military resources have been exhausted. The number of men aged 36 and above, and those aged 25 to 35, accounts for only 15%, and the rest are old and young. The previous conscription system, which required a height of five feet three inches, was abolished last year. Regardless of physical condition, men are forcibly conscripted. Domestic work is mostly done by women and children, and the cost of living is unspeakable. All military supplies will be in use soon. Anti-war sentiment is spreading across the country. Factories and warehouses are being burned, and social order is extremely chaotic. A major change may occur soon. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Expenditure Huge, Economy Exhausted, How to Cope with Budget Proposal, Financial Authorities Quite Anxious</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Finance Minister Sakurai stated in the House of Representatives today that there is nothing to worry about regarding Japan's economic strength. Japan's military expenditure for the China Incident, including the military budget for the next fiscal year, will total around 17,000,000,000 yuan. On the other hand, it is estimated that the total income of the Japanese people in 1939 was between 25,000,000,000 yuan and 26,000,000,000 yuan. Public savings in the same year are expected to exceed 10,000,000,000 yuan, and will increase by 100 million to 200 million yuan in 1940. If the Japanese people work diligently together, there is little reason to worry. Japan still relies on overseas sources for the supply of some raw materials, but he has paid close attention to this matter and will take urgent measures if necessary. (Reuters, 18th)</p>

<h3>U.S. Plans to Actively Expand Navy to Cope with European and Asian Situations, Vinson Bill Submitted to House for Discussion, Add New Ships and Increase Aircraft to 3,000, Chairman of Military Committee Strongly Advocates Fortifying Guam</h3>
<p>Washington: When the Vinson Naval Bill, including a program to expand Guam, totaling US$966,772,878, was submitted to the House of Representatives for a vote yesterday, the U.S. fleet will still be concentrated in the Alaska, Hawaii, and Samoa line in the central Pacific. Secretary of the Navy Edison, while attending the House Naval Affairs Committee, confirmed that the Navy has no intention of moving the Pacific Fleet to the Atlantic or withdrawing the Pacific Fleet to the West Coast. The Navy Department will disregard whether Congress allocates additional funds for the development of Guam, and plans to proceed directly with the development of Guam, which is only 1,500 miles from Yokohama, Japan. Rear Admiral Moreell, Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks, announced to the House Naval Affairs Committee that the Navy Department's naval base construction has already exceeded what is stipulated in the program. The Navy Department also plans to fortify Wake Island in the central Pacific this year. Of the $63,000,000 in naval base construction costs, $50,000,000 has been used. Construction of various naval bases is underway. These bases include Kania Bay and Pearl Harbor in the central Pacific, Midway Island, Johnston Island, and Palmyra Island, and Kodiak and Sitka in Alaska. The Navy Department will request $20,000,000 for the development of Wake Island this year. The last Congress approved the Wake Island fortification bill but did not allocate funds. This Navy Bill includes the construction of twelve new battleships, including two 45,000-ton super-dreadnoughts and 352 aircraft. (United Press, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington: The government's proposed naval expenditure bill, totaling $966,772,878, was recently reviewed and passed by the House Appropriations Committee and immediately submitted to the House for discussion, with an accompanying recommendation to start construction on several battleships and cruisers, which must be more powerful than similar warships in other countries. According to the report submitted by Chief of Naval Operations Stark at today's committee discussion, "It is still difficult to accurately determine the goals and ambitions of Germany, the Soviet Union, and Italy. The public statements issued by the governments of these countries cannot be accepted as genuine. Therefore, the current war in Europe may spread to all of Europe. In addition, it is difficult to predict how the situation in the Far East will evolve. All of these may trigger a world war." Although the United States Navy is more prepared than in 1914, "the crisis that the international situation has imposed on our country is even greater than at the beginning of the last war." The United States currently has 120 warships under construction, but 29 more need to be added immediately. In addition, the naval authorities plan to purchase 576 aircraft to increase the total number of naval aircraft to 3,304 by July 30, 1941. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>Washington: House Military Affairs Committee Chairman Mayes, in a speech to the House yesterday, called for the United States to immediately fortify Guam. Mayes said, "If we fortify Guam, the United States will not have to fear attacks from any direction in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. After the United States establishes an air force base in Guam, it can monitor the movements of the Japanese Navy. We must know that the Japanese's habit is to go to war without declaring it. We must prevent sudden attacks by the Japanese. In the Far East, we must take resolute action, and only then can we gain the respect of the Japanese. Currently, the Japanese destruction of American interests in China has not reached the point where the United States goes to war with Japan, but we must maintain our interests."

<h3>Welles' Visit to Europe, Britain Prepares to Welcome, Chamberlain Answers Parliament Member's Question</h3>
<p>London: When the House of Commons met today, Greenwood, a Labour MP from the opposition, raised a question regarding U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles' visit to Europe. Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied, "The U.S. government issued a statement on the 9th of this month, stating that Under Secretary Welles, at the request of President Roosevelt, is scheduled to visit Italy, France, Germany, and Britain in a short period of time. His only goal is to investigate the current situation in Europe to report to President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull, but he has no authority to make recommendations or accept obligations in the name of the U.S. government. The statements made to him by the authorities of various countries should also be kept absolutely confidential and only used to inform President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull. The British government is prepared to welcome the representative of the U.S. President and conduct open and honest talks with him to ensure that President Roosevelt receives an accurate report on the European situation, which is superfluous to say." (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>Washington: After a lengthy conversation with Secretary of State Hull, U.S. Ambassador to Britain Kennedy told reporters that the most important issue at present is the issue of new shipping routes after the U.S. implements the neutrality law.

<h3>Second Act of European War About to Begin, British Ministry of Information Official Speaks in Lancashire</h3>
<p>London: Sir Grig, a Ministry of Information official attending Parliament, said in a speech in Lancashire today that the second act of the war will begin soon. Hitler may take a major offensive or may remain idle. If he takes the first route, the British people will respond as they have in the past. The advantage held by Germany is that it prepared for a longer time in peacetime and carefully stored military supplies that can be used for a serious strike. Sir Grig then described the distinction between the war aims and peace aims made by Prime Minister Chamberlain, saying that the peace aims are indeed necessary, but unless the war aims have been achieved, they will ultimately be a dream. Now, if the German military power is not destroyed, the future of Europe and Britain will only be depression and darkness. To win victory, there are four things to do: (1) The fighting power of the allied countries, although already strong, must be rapidly expanded. (2) Increase the production of military supplies. (3) Strive to consolidate the country's finances. (4) Strive to prosper the export trade. We can all fulfill our responsibilities in one or two of these four nationwide efforts. Everything we enjoy on weekdays can be saved and we can endure the shortage. The government has done its best to alleviate hardship by distributing food, setting food prices, and other methods. The people must endure the hardships ahead. Let us all stand up to face them, for never have people of any generation marched forward in formation under such a clear banner to pursue such a noble goal. (Reuters, 14th)</p>

<h3>Germany's War Aims: Goebbels' Speech</h3>
<p>Berlin – German Propaganda Minister Goebbels stated yesterday in a speech to 500 propagandists at the Propaganda Ministry that Hitler's Germany only knows the sole purpose of this war: to defeat the plutocratic politics of Western Europe. This war is a struggle between German National Socialism and British plutocratic politics. The German people are determined to achieve victory for the sake of their national survival. Goebbels then mentioned the British side's criticism of Germany's inhumane warfare methods, strongly arguing that Britain's standard for criticizing any tactics is determined by its own interests. Thus, they consider blockade humane because Britain possesses the world's largest fleet; they consider aerial warfare inhumane because the British air force is not as strong as Germany's. It must be known that Germany has decided to engage in war with all its might. A certain British diplomat recently made a statement saying that the world cannot tolerate the coexistence of two strong nations like Britain and Germany; therefore, one of the two must perish. If this statement truly represents Britain's war aim of destroying Germany, then Germany will respond with the same determination to defeat Britain. (Haitong Telegraph, 14th)</p>

<h3>Battles on the Karelian Isthmus Intensify: Soviet War Report Claims Continued Progress; Finnish Headquarters Appeals for Foreign Aid</h3>
<p>Stockholm – For the past ten days, Soviet troops have launched a large-scale offensive in the Karelian Isthmus in southern Finland. According to military observers here, this is the second phase of the Finnish-Soviet war. The Red Army intends to concentrate its forces and break through Finland's Mannerheim Line in one fell swoop. However, judging from the current situation, if the Finnish army can quickly obtain assistance, it will at least be able to resist for several weeks or even months. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>Helsinki – The General Headquarters has just released a war report stating: (1) On the Karelian Isthmus, the Red Army continues to advance on our army's positions. The fighting in the Summa area and along the Taipale River is quite fierce, but all attacks have been repelled.

(2) North of Lake Ladoga, the Red Army has repeatedly attacked, but all attacks have been repelled. (3) Our aircraft have flown to the rear of the Red Army for reconnaissance and bombed the Red Army's supply convoys and bases. Soviet aircraft are also very active. Five of them have been shot down by our side, of which four have been confirmed. (Havas, 13th)</p>

<p>Helsinki – The Finnish Army General Headquarters issued a statement last night stating that Finland's need for foreign aid is now more urgent than ever. As far as the fighting in the Summa area is concerned, the front line is just over ten kilometers long, but the Soviet Union is attacking with its maximum manpower and material resources. The Finnish defense line had not been breached as of last night, but the artillery used by the Soviet Union is of a caliber and range that are not comparable to ordinary artillery. The Soviet Air Force is also extraordinarily active. Hundreds of aircraft flew over Finnish positions yesterday at very low altitudes. Under these circumstances, Finland urgently needs foreign aid and hopes that this aid can be received as soon as possible. (Haitong Telegraph, 14th)</p>
<p>London – Finnish university professor Poleni said here that several German officers have recently been directing the Red Army to fight against our troops.

In the past 24 hours, the Soviet side fired no less than 300,000 artillery shells at Finnish army positions. At the same time, Soviet aircraft made every effort to assist in the battle. Both sides suffered heavy losses. According to Finnish observations, the enemy soldiers along the 90-kilometer front line are all elite troops of the Red Army. After the artillery battles, both sides often engage in hand-to-hand combat, fighting fiercely. In the eastern sector of the Karelian front, the Red Army has made progress near Taipale. The Soviet troops fighting in the central sector are advancing westward, 25 kilometers from Viipuri. Yesterday, several Soviet military aircraft bombed Helsinki, Viipuri, and Lahti, where the Finnish radio station is located, dropping multiple bombs. (Haitong Telegraph, 14th)</p>
<p>Stockholm – According to observers returning from the Summa front, it has been confirmed that Soviet troops have not invaded the Mannerheim Line in that area.

Upon receiving the news, the ship's crew set fire to the ship and then scuttled it. HMS Hawkins took no action against the Wakama. The Wakama was fully loaded with 6,000 tons of cargo, including grain, coffee, lard, leather, minerals, and cotton, estimated to be worth $1,250,000. The Wakama arrived in Rio de Janeiro a week before the outbreak of the war, and was the last German ship to dock here. (Reuters, 13th)</p>

<h3>Various Opinions After the Establishment of the German-Soviet Economic Agreement: German Newspapers Believe It Has the Nature of an Economic Alliance; British and French Figures Doubt the Value of the Agreement</h3>
<p>Berlin – The National Daily, which is close to General Goering, today listed the goods to be exchanged as stipulated in the German-Soviet trade agreement as follows: Germany will import from the Soviet Union grain, cotton, flax, hemp, manganese, chromium, bran, platinum, sulfur, kerosene, vegetable oil, fat, wood, oilseed cake, cream, cowhide, vegetables. Germany will assist the Soviet Union in artificially manufacturing rubber and refining kerosene from coal. Germany will also supply the Soviet Union with utensils and instruments. The paper stated that the agreement is extremely beneficial to Germany and is more valuable than winning a victory, as Britain believes that blockading Germany is an excellent strategy for defeating it, but the signing of the German-Soviet trade agreement has invalidated the blockade policy. (Haitong Telegraph, 14th)</p>
<p>The Hague – After the establishment of the new economic agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union, German newspapers have unanimously praised it, saying that Germany and the Soviet Union have established an "economic alliance." From now on, Germany will no longer have to worry about a shortage of raw materials. However, the newspapers did not mention the types, quantities, or delivery methods of the goods involved in the agreement. In addition, German newspapers also commented on the French political situation, saying that although the National Assembly unanimously passed a vote of confidence in the Daladier cabinet, "a cabinet crisis is still only a matter of time." As for Italy, the newspapers unanimously said that the friendly relations between Germany and Italy are as strong as ever. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>Paris – Figures in business circles here recently commented on the economic agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union, saying that the volume of trade between the two countries in the first year will be increased to the highest level in the past, in other words, to the level of 1931, which is 1.2 billion marks. But one point to note is that according to the statistics for that year, German goods shipped to the Soviet Union were worth more than 800 million marks, which was more than the 300 million marks of Soviet goods shipped to Germany. If trade continues to develop at this rate in the future, Germany will still not be able to obtain a large supply of the raw materials it needs. According to the public statements issued by both sides, the volume of imports and exports between the two countries must be "offset" in the future, in other words, imports and exports should each account for half of the total amount of 1.2 billion marks. But in reality, since 1931, Soviet goods shipped to Germany have never reached the standard of 600 million marks. In 1935, it totaled 215 million marks. In that case, the agreement that has now been signed is tantamount to wanting to triple the amount of Soviet goods shipped to Germany in one fell swoop. If so, unless Soviet production has been greatly improved in the past few months, the estimates made in the German-Soviet agreement are based on other factors. In fact, even based on the economic agreement signed by the two sides on September 28 last year, the various clauses were unable to be realized due to the Soviet Union's use of troops against Finland and the lack of transportation facilities. According to reliable sources, one of the greatest difficulties encountered by the representatives of the two countries during the negotiations was determining the purchasing power of the mark. As Germany did when dealing with Central European countries, it wanted to arbitrarily set the exchange rate for the mark and force the Soviet Union to accept it, but this was rejected by the Soviet side. After several rounds of negotiations, a compromise plan was finally established. In short, observers believe that the most important part of the agreement is not the huge trade volume stipulated in it, but a provision that Germany has the right to interfere in Soviet production. In other words, Germany should send its own personnel to the Soviet Union to handle development, manufacturing, and transportation matters in order to utilize Soviet resources. It is said that this provision is tantamount to changing the "cash and carry" clause into a "manufacture and carry" clause. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>Rome – Rome newspapers today published articles commenting on the newly concluded trade agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union, unanimously pointing out that this agreement allows Germany to exchange a large number of industrial products for Soviet raw materials. The "Italian News" quoted a report from a Moscow correspondent as saying that Soviet political figures believe that the scope of economic cooperation stipulated in the Soviet-German trade agreement is unprecedented in the history of international trade relations. In addition, the agreement expresses the hope to continue to expand the scope of trade, which shows that Soviet-German trade may exceed the figures stipulated in the agreement. In the future, in order to exchange for Soviet kerosene, grain, and minerals, Germany will establish profitable industries in various transportation centers in Russia. (Haitong Telegraph, 14th)</p>
<h3>Britain Orders Fruit from Turkey</h3>

<h3>French National Assembly's Army Committee Banquets Daladier</h3>
<p>Paris – Prime Minister Daladier had requested to attend the National Assembly's Army Committee this afternoon to report on the government's efforts in military affairs. Because the Prime Minister had already delivered a lengthy speech and made detailed explanations at a secret meeting of the National Assembly a few days ago, the members of the Army Committee believed that it was not necessary to hear the Prime Minister's report again. Therefore, it was decided to change the meeting to a public banquet for the Prime Minister at noon today. (Havas, 14th)</p>

<p>Chongqing: Since the start of the war of resistance, the government has repeatedly stipulated methods and actively implemented them to consolidate finance and stabilize the exchange rate market. Regulations for the management of foreign exchange for imports require strict enforcement. In July of last year, the Ministry of Finance announced rules for applying to purchase foreign exchange for imported goods. Except for prohibited imported goods, those related to economic construction and essential daily necessities are allowed to apply for foreign exchange in accordance with the regulations. However, the applicant must first fill out an application form with the name, quantity, price, import, and sales locations of the goods and send it to the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee for review, or submit it through a bank for forwarding. Since the implementation of the aforementioned rules, various procedures have been stipulated successively and notified to applicants and processing banks for compliance. To facilitate compliance, the Ministry has recently formulated and announced the (Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Rules for Applying to Purchase Foreign Exchange for Imported Goods). The full text of eleven articles is quite detailed. The original text is extracted as follows:</p>

<h3>Battle for Zhanglin in Chenghai: Zhanglin Lost and Regained, Street Fighting Occurs in Shantou</h3>
<p>(Special Correspondence) The war situation in eastern Guangdong has remained unchanged for nearly half a year. The Japanese army uses Nan'ao Island as its rear, Shantou City as a major stronghold, the Chao-Shan Railway's Han River tributary as the main transportation artery, Chao'an City as its left flank, and Chenghai City as its right flank. The Japanese army's Eastern Route Headquarters is set up in Anbu to secure the periphery of Shantou City and support the cities of Chao'an and Chenghai. The target of its left-wing offensive is Jieyang. Battles occur continuously on the Anjie Road and in Yixi, Qiulang Mountain, Fengxi, etc., indicating that the main Japanese offensive is in the Fengjie area. The Chinese army's central forces are scattered in the Sangpu Mountains west of the railway line and frequently attack Anbu, Hailian Mountain, Hong'an, Fuyang, and other places to contain the Japanese army in Chao'an, preventing it from venturing westward on the Anjie Road. The target of the Japanese army's right-wing offensive is Raoping and Zhao'an. The failure of the Japanese and puppet troops to invade Zhao'an last winter proves that the Japanese army does not lack the desire to advance eastward, but is limited by its strength. From a military perspective, the Japanese army's ability to occupy Chao'an and Chenghai for a long time relies on the rapid support of the navy and air force. The lower reaches of the Han River and the plains are crisscrossed by rivers, which are conducive to the Japanese army's defense and unfavorable to the Chinese side's large-scale troop movements and offensives. Fortunately, the Chinese side has geographical advantages and popular support, and can use mountain passes to launch surprise attacks and harass the enemy's front, rear, left, and right flanks, causing the Japanese to be overwhelmed and exhausted. Strategically, if the Japanese army cannot expand eastward to the mountain ranges on the Fujian-Guangdong border and firmly control Raoping City, then the situation in Chao'an will be precarious, and it will certainly not dare to use force against Fengshun and Jieyang. Conversely, if the Japanese army in Chenghai wants to move eastward, it must first eliminate the threat of the Chinese army in the Sangpu Mountains west of the railway before daring to cross the river and expand its occupied area towards Zhanglin and Donglong. The situation in Chao'an and Chenghai in January fully demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses of both sides. When the Japanese army in Chao'an launched an offensive towards Fengjie on January 21, the Hong and Li units of the Chinese army stationed in Zhanglin and Lianyang crossed the river and launched a fierce attack on the northeast gate of Chenghai City. The Japanese army mobilized marine corps from Nan'ao Island, Haishan Island, Hongmen, and other places to rush to Waisha and Chenghai to provide assistance. The Chinese teams stationed in Zhelin crossed the sea to retake the salt-producing area of Haishan and attacked Nan'ao, completely crushing the Japanese army's intention to invade westward into Chao'an. Because the Chinese army is in a proactive position, it often attacks in the east and strikes in the west. When Chao'an is tight, it takes advantage of the situation to attack Chenghai City. When Chenghai is tight, it attacks Chao'an. Therefore, when the Chinese army raided Nan'ao Island from Raoping on the 21st, the Japanese army in Chao'an immediately sent puppet peacekeepers to Chenghai to confront the Chinese army in Zhanglin and Lianyang across the river. By the early hours of the 26th, 300 Japanese soldiers with a small artillery squad launched a fierce offensive, causing Zhanglin to fall. All the shops in the city were devastated. At night, reinforcements from the Chinese army stationed in Raoping arrived and launched a counterattack in the dark with the cooperation of the local militia, succeeding in driving back the Japanese army and routing them back to Chenghai City. At that time, the Japanese army in Chao'an urgently dispatched more than 100 soldiers to provide assistance, but they were intercepted and severely attacked by the Chinese army ten miles away in Xitang and could not pass. The Japanese army in Chenghai sent more than 200 reinforcements and opened fire to bombard the Chinese army's positions. On the morning of the 27th, reinforcements from the Chinese army arrived from Fengxi, and fierce battles broke out again in Xitang and Chihu, continuing in a stalemate until noon. Along the Chao-Shan Railway, gunshots were heard everywhere from the 27th. After Zhanglin was recaptured by the Chinese army, the Fujian-Guangdong border area was pacified, and salt, beans, oil, and grain could be transported from southern Fujian to Chaozhou and Meizhou for sale.</p>
<p>Another report states that as the fighting along the Chao-Shan Railway intensified, Chenghai City and Chao'an City were surrounded on three sides by the Chinese army. The Japanese army's artillery in Chao'an fired on Anjie Road on the 27th to provide support. The Japanese strongholds in Chihu, Quan Temple, and Gezhou were besieged for three days, and their supplies of ammunition and food were gradually depleted. Anbu, Caitang, Hong'an, Jinshi, Guanchao, and Fuyang were also constantly attacked, with the Japanese army suffering more than 200 casualties. The Chinese army in the Sangpu Mountains advanced and stationed on Panlong Mountain, Wuta Mountain, and Hailian Mountain along the railway. At 10 PM on the 27th, it launched fierce attacks on Anbu, Maolong, Malong, Meixitou, Chuantoutou, Doumen Bridge, and Qishan Xinxiang in the suburbs of Shantou. The intense sound of gunfire could be heard as far as Jiaoshi in Shantou City. The Chinese army's commandos, who were hiding in the urban area, also launched a rebellion, setting fires and responding to the attacks. They burned the Huilan Bridge and the Japanese army's warehouse on Zhongma Road, and used bombs to attack Japanese and puppet agencies and military stations along the way. Street fighting broke out in Zhongshan Park and Qi Lu. Senior Japanese officials fled to ships. Shantou City was temporarily plunged into chaos, with flames soaring into the sky. The Japanese army held onto the railway station and refused to retreat. On the morning of the 29th, the Japanese navy and air force from Waisha in Chenghai arrived, and the Chinese commandos began to retreat towards Pengzhou Suo Dajing. It is estimated that 70-80 Japanese and puppet soldiers were killed in the bombings. The guerrilla forces in the suburbs also retreated towards Panlong Mountain. Late that night, the Chinese army attacked Anbu and Shantou City again. The Chinese army in Zhanglin and Lianyang split into two routes, crossed the river, and attacked the Xiapu area of Chenghai City, attempting to enter the Qilu Airport through Jiding. Japanese strongholds below Chao'an were besieged by the Chinese army everywhere. At 9 AM on the 30th, the sound of gunfire was still extremely dense. Three Japanese planes flew low to provide support. The fierce fighting took place on Panlong Mountain and gradually spread to the northwest of the railway.</p>
<h3>Depressed Commercial Scene in Jiangyin City, Weak Purchasing Power of the People, Mostly Losing Money and Closing Down</h3>
<p>(Jiangyin Correspondence) At the end of the year in ruined Jiangyin City, all industries have come to a conclusion. For example, the rice industry, which is the most suitable for stockpiling, is subject to Japanese control, and the transportation is restricted by guerrilla teams outside the city, leading to a tightening of price increases day by day, with no sign of decline. The price differences between rice shops are huge, and the market price fluctuates unpredictably. Rice shops dare not stock up in large quantities, and their capital is insufficient, making them unable to operate. Many are closing down. Only Yuanlong Rice Shop in Huaqiao in the city is struggling to maintain operations. Tianzhang and Dacheng silk and cloth shops were destroyed by the war and have not yet resumed business. Currently, only Jiuda, Qinkang, Xinhua, and a few other shops remain. Because the source of new goods is tight and prices are rising, the selling price is also increasing. However, there are few people in the city, and their purchasing power is weak, so business has plummeted. Daily necessities such as northern and southern goods are mostly small in scale due to lack of funds. Only Huashengtai has had unexpected gains during the war and has a larger capital. Other shops such as Tiansheng are just barely surviving. Other businesses such as Linxiangtai Tongsheng oil and wine shops that resumed business after the war, Xinxin and Dongfang inns newly opened by Merchants Bureau, and entertainment venues such as Yilong Erhousi's storytelling venues and Xixing Restaurant are all suffering losses due to the depressed social scene and the people's dire financial straits, with expenditures exceeding income. Given the commercial situation in the city, even if the Japanese puppets try their best, dreaming of restoring the pre-war situation will be in vain.</p>

<h3>The Sichuan-Kang Science Expedition Team Actively Working, Exploring Scientific Resources in Remote Areas of Sichuan and Kang</h3>
<p>(Xichang Correspondence) The Sichuan-Kang Science Expedition Team, managed by the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund, consists of five groups: geology and mining, engineering, agriculture and forestry, socio-economics. Led by the team leader Shao Yizhou and deputy team leader Huang Guozhang, the team of more than 40 members set off from Jiading in early July of last year and achieved fruitful results in Sichuan. In mid-August, they arrived in Kangding and conducted separate investigations. In mid-September, they split into groups again. The socio-economics groups, led by group leaders Feng Hanji and Wu Qiyuan, went to various places in Ningzu. The agriculture and forestry group, led by group leader Ye Yage, investigated Danba, Mougong, and Guanxian. The geology and mining groups, led by Shao and Huang, investigated the area north of Kangding. In mid-October, they arrived in Garze, which is the political and religious center of northern Kang and an important route between Qingkang and Tibet. After detailed investigations in the area, the geology and mining group turned south to Dantong, passed through Danba, Dajinchuan and Xiaojinchuan, and went to Mougong, Lifan, and Songpan. This route is controlled by the Fan people, and transportation is blocked. Travelers often feel exhausted and face many dangers. The team also had to cross Dapao Mountain, which is as high as 4,800 meters. The members of the group, with the spirit of scientific investigation, safely completed their task. The engineering group and part of the members of the geology and mining and socio-economics groups, led by the team leader, traveled south from Garze through Luhua and arrived in Lihua, the highest city in western Sichuan, in mid-November. The first part of this route is the Yalong River Valley area, with high mountains and deep valleys, jagged rocks, and dangerous paths. A slight mistake would lead to eternal regret. The second part is the top of the western Sichuan plateau, with an average altitude of 4,000 meters. Although it was early spring in the interior, the plateau was covered with ice and snow. At the same time, they also crossed Danzhanila Mountain, which is as high as 5,400 meters. The deep snow was over the knees, and there were no traces to follow. The team members, braving the dangers, advanced and camped in the desolate snowy wilderness, and finally completed their mission amidst hardships. After Lihua, they went south through Chongxi Tusi, Niuchang, Yajiang, Jiulong, Benli, Yanyuan, and other places, and arrived in Xichang in late December, lasting three months and more. They thoroughly investigated mineral resources, hydrology, transportation, economy, society, education, agriculture, and animal husbandry in more than a dozen counties in the north and south of Kang province, and surveyed and mapped the longitude, latitude, and altitude. This journey covered over a thousand kilometers, breaking previous records. After Xichang, they will continue to investigate Leima, Ping, and Emei within the possible scope. Sun Mingjing, a photographer from the Film Education Department of Jinling University, who was hired by the expedition team in Chongqing, has finished filming the life of the Kang people in the northern Kang area and has gone to Fug, Baiyu, and Baan. He is still working.</p>

<h3>Outlying Roads Agreement, Rumored to be Signed Soon, Establishment of So-Called "Joint Police Force" Fanke Ling Has Returned to Shanghai to Preside Over the Matter</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 14th: According to today's Japanese newspapers, a dispatch from Shanghai stated that Shanghai Mayor Fu Xiao'an and Gong Department Director Fanke Ling are expected to sign an agreement on outlying roads soon. According to this agreement, "the management rights of outlying roads will be transferred to the local Chinese authorities."</p>
<p>Director General Returns to Shanghai to Sign Soon</p>
<p>Dalu Bao said that the possibility of signing the outlying roads agreement of the "Shanghai Special Police Bureau" this week has been enhanced due to the return of Fanke Ling, Director General of the Gong Department, from Dalian yesterday (the 13th). Fei Li Pu, Director General and President of the Gong Department, confirmed the agreement when he denied the conditions of the reported agreement on Monday, and it will be signed soon. According to non-official circles close to the Gong Department, it has been rumored that an agreement on the police power of outlying roads has been negotiated and will be signed when Fanke Ling returns to Shanghai after a ten-day trip to Dalian. The main points of the agreement stipulate the establishment of a joint police force, named "Shanghai Special Police Bureau", whose police chief will be appointed by the "Shanghai Municipal Government", and the Gong Department will appoint a deputy police chief.</p>
<h3>Spring Labor Comfort Money, Has Reached the Full Amount</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Spring Labor Comfort Money is set at 50,000 yuan. Since the start of fundraising, all industries have enthusiastically assumed responsibility and have reached the full amount. Now, all industries are conducting fundraising among member companies and firms to ensure timely payment. In addition, the National Government Salvation Bonds have been sold in large quantities in Shanghai. Since the New Transportation Federation advocated the bond donation movement, donations from all industries and individuals have also been very enthusiastic. According to the measures for the bond donation to save the country movement, the scope of bond donation is stipulated as (1) National Salvation Bonds, (2) National Defense Bonds, (3) Disaster Relief Bonds, (4) Gold Bonds and British Gold Bonds, (5) National Bonds and American Gold Bonds, (6) Gold Bonds and Gold Bonds, (7) Other government bonds issued by the National Government that do not belong to the above six types. The domestic bond collection agencies are entrusted to the Central, China, Communications, Farmers, and Head Offices, and their branches in various places for collection.</p>
<h3>Commodity Prices Threaten People's Livelihood, Reaching a Serious Stage, Rice and Flour Soared Again Yesterday, Fuel Prospects Worrying</h3>
<p>The high commodity prices in Shanghai have entered a serious stage, and all parties are paying attention to it. After the Spring Festival market opened, rice and coal continued to rise, and the people's livelihood has actually reached a point where it cannot be maintained. All public groups are concerned about this. The Citizens' Union of the First Special District of this city believes that food and fuel are most closely related to the people's livelihood, and has decided to ask the Food Regulation Association to raise public funds to expand the scope of subsidized sales. On the one hand, foreign rice is still being ordered continuously, because although foreign rice is expensive at present, the evolution of rice is difficult to predict. If foreign rice is adequately prepared, it will have a good impact on suppressing prices. The association hopes that major factories, companies, firms, and families with financial resources can participate in ordering foreign rice as reserves, and leave domestic rice for civilians to sell in retail. At this time, it should be advocated that rich people eat expensive rice, and poor people eat cheap rice. Rich people should not compete with poor people for food. The association is also considering jointly discussing with various public groups to implement group coal purchases, in view of the seriousness of coal prices, in order to relieve the people's livelihood. There are various reasons for the high commodity prices in Shanghai, and the main factors are the coercion of products in the occupied areas, the manipulation of transportation, or the interception along the way, or the heavy taxation. All parties unanimously hope that the concession authorities will stand on the position of the local administrative authorities and work hard to improve the situation.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice Reaches the 50 Yuan Mark</p>
<p>After the rice market opened the day before yesterday, the selling price had already soared by six or seven yuan compared to before the holiday. Yesterday's opening price rose by another two yuan, with the highest selling price reaching the 50 yuan mark and the lowest at 47.6 yuan, exceeding the limit price of domestic rice by 10 yuan (actually 16 yuan), which is unprecedented. Previously, the concession authorities did not stipulate foreign rice when setting price limits because the foreign exchange rate for foreign rice was uncertain. The current selling price of foreign rice was only 39 yuan before the domestic rice price limit, but it has created such a situation in a short period of time. Therefore, after being urged by various sectors, the authorities have paid close attention and studied prevention, and will take more effective measures when necessary. However, citizens hope that the authorities will organize a commodity price assessment committee to assess daily necessities on a weekly basis so that citizens can maintain their lives.</p>
<p>Flour Prices Increase by Yuan at Every Turn</p>
<p>Other miscellaneous grains, such as flour, were only sold for 10 to 11 yuan during the Spring Festival. Yesterday's gray market also rose by 2.5 yuan, reaching 13.6 to 7 yuan. This kind of price increase is even more novel, because before the war, it was only sold for about 1.7 yuan. Even if the price increases by only a few cents, unless there is a drastic change in the market, there will be slightly larger fluctuations, but it is only one or two cents. But now, there is only an increase without a decrease, and the price is always more than one or two yuan. Other items such as wheat and soybeans are also increasing proportionally due to the surge in demand, with no end in sight. Due to the soaring prices of rice and wheat, the price increases of porridge, rice noodles, and other foods made from grains are almost impossible to count. And the price of alcoholic beverages increased by 20% in November. Yesterday, the prices of various Chinese and Western alcoholic beverages rose again. Green bean wine rose by 20%, and Shaoxing wine and white wine rose by 30% to 40%. On average, the selling price of each item has increased by more than twice compared to before the war. Other foreign wines have even greater price increases due to transportation difficulties, scarce arrivals, and soaring foreign exchange rates.</p>
<p>Subsidized Sales and Free Meals are Urgently Needed</p>
<p>The subsidized sales committee initiated by all sectors started subsidized sales from December 21st of last year to February 5th. The common people all praised it. Then, it temporarily stopped due to the end of the total period. Since the committee raised funds, donations from all sectors have been very enthusiastic. Since the subsidized sales were temporarily suspended, in view of the rising rice prices in recent days, it has become more difficult for the people to maintain their livelihoods. For this reason, the committee members have decided to convene a general meeting this week to discuss the continuation of subsidized sales. However, there are rumors that it will be entrusted to the original rice shops to resume subsidized sales from the 23rd, but there is no definite news. The official date must be decided by a meeting, and the procedures are also complicated, but the time should not be far off. In addition, since the Salvation Army began to provide free hot meals, the results have been quite good. In view of the soaring prices and the endlessness of the current commodity prices in this city, the poor have difficulty making a living. The army has continued to hold the event for two months. Starting from the evening of the 13th, in consultation with the police department of the Gong Department, the fixed locations of Ningbo Road, West Xinxiao in the French Concession, and the northern section of Yu Qiaqing Road in the British Concession in front of the water company will be changed. Free hot meals will be provided from 6:30 p.m. The order is maintained by Major Ma Ruishan and Lieutenant Colonel Du Baotian of the army, and it is quite good. The number of packages issued daily is always more than 3,000.</p>
<p>About 80,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrived Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, a large number of foreign rice continued to arrive in Shanghai. In addition to the 39,100 bags transported by the French ship, which were recorded in yesterday's newspaper, the Italian ship Himalaya, which loaded 4,000 tons from Saigon, calculated as 40,000 bags, also entered the port before noon yesterday before and after the French ship and docked at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou. They are now being unloaded. The two ships together carry a total of 80,000 bags of foreign rice.</p>
<p>Foreign Newspapers' Observation of Coal Prices</p>
<p>The Dalu Bao said that a major coal merchant in this city claimed yesterday (the 13th) that there is an extreme shortage of coal in this city, which has not been seen since the World War I in 1914. If coal prices continue to rise as they are now, they will soon exceed the highest record of 350 yuan per ton created during the last major war.</p>
<p>About Three Months Ago</p>
<p>Bituminous coal was sold for 100 to 110 yuan per ton. During the Lunar New Year, it suddenly rose to about 180 yuan. Since there is no hope for improvement in the market, it is expected that the price will break the 200 yuan per ton mark in the next few weeks. Even the market price of coal balls has reached 100 yuan per ton. Hard coal has also become more expensive in the past three months. The current market price is 140 yuan per ton for Hongji coal.</p>
<p>Reasons for High Coal Prices</p>
<p>As follows: (1) In the past, 20% of the coal needed in this city came from the east and Keelung. Now the coal produced in these two places has been diverted to Japan. (2) There are wars in Europe and Asia, and the number of ships transporting coal to Shanghai has decreased, resulting in higher shipping costs. (3) Indian coal has been diverted to Europe for use by the Allied countries, so India is also experiencing a coal shortage. (4) The exchange rate of Chinese currency has fallen. When the European war was about to break out, Shanghai could still buy a ton of Indian coal for 50 yuan.</p>
<p>According to People in the Industry</p>
<p>Last year, many coal companies had surpluses. For example, Yitaixing's business was very prosperous, and although the profits were not as large as rumored, they were still considerable. However, they were still buying and selling as they went. The company that made the most profit last year was the coal company that did not sell its goods for a long time after purchasing them, and only sold them at the recent final settlement. The amount of profit was immeasurable.</p>
<h3>Integrity and Shame Movement, Telegram Congratulating the Victory in Guinan</h3>
<p>The Integrity and Shame Movement Committee sent a telegram congratulating the great victory in Guinan and all other fronts. The original text reads: To the President Chiang of the National Government of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang in Chongqing, and forwarded to the soldiers on the front lines in Guinan, Ganbei, Hubei Central, Suixi, and Zhejiang East: The Japanese army launched a large-scale invasion of Guinan. Thanks to our central authorities and supreme commander, the command was resolute, and the soldiers gave their lives. After the two great victories in Xiangbei and Yuebei, there was an even greater and more glorious victory. At the same time, there were also good news from Suixi, Hubei Central, Ganbei, and Zhejiang East. Since the beginning of the second phase of the War of Resistance, there have been such constant and amazing gains, which proves that the ultimate victory belongs to us without a doubt. When the news came, the citizens of Shanghai rejoiced. In addition to encouraging citizens to cultivate their integrity and promote integrity and shame, and vowing to be the backing, the association sent a congratulatory telegram and paid tribute. The Shanghai Integrity and Shame Movement Committee bowed and sealed.</p>

<p>United Press of America, This City: According to the Japanese Navy spokesman today, from tonight onwards, Chinese people entering the public concession area under the jurisdiction of the Japanese Navy (i.e., Hongkou and Yangshupu) no longer need to prepare special passes. Starting tonight, the curfew in the area will also be lifted, but Japanese sentries will still be stationed at the bridges, and all goods entering and leaving must be inspected. The Japanese side hopes to be able to cancel this inspection work in the short term. As for the outlying roads issue, an agreement is expected to be reached today. According to another news, the curfew in the area will be moved to 12:00 midnight.</p>
<p>Restrictions and Changes in West Shanghai</p>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening News stated that the Shanghai Japanese Naval Landing Forces issued a bulletin at 9:00 a.m. this morning (the 14th), stating that from 12:00 midnight on February 14th, Chinese people entering the Japanese military defense zone of the Public Concession do not need to show passes, and curfew restrictions will also be lifted. This measure will also apply to the Hongkou areas patrolled by the Japanese Navy. As for the restrictions in West Shanghai and its suburbs controlled by the Japanese Army, there is still no change. If necessary, Chinese people and their belongings will be searched at any time. Chinese people who intend to live in the Hongkou Japanese Navy defense zone must still obtain a permit issued by the Fuxing Class of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces from their parents. The Japanese side believes that the security situation in these areas is quite satisfactory, so in order to facilitate the residence of Chinese people and third-country people, the above measures have been taken.</p>
<p>Opening Implemented This Morning</p>
<p>Domei News Agency, Shanghai, 14th: Since the outbreak of the incident, the Japanese army has restricted traffic in the area north of the Suzhou River in Shanghai, i.e., Hongkou, Zhabei, Yangshupu, etc., for the necessity of combat and maintaining security. In general, Chinese people were prohibited from passing through unless they had a pass. However, the Japanese military authorities, in view of the recent security situation, have decided to abolish the restrictions on Chinese people and the night-time traffic restrictions on Chinese people and third-country people holding passes in the Japanese Marine Corps's surprise attack area in the area from 0:00 a.m. on the 15th. The Japanese Naval Landing Forces authorities officially announced this at 10:00 a.m. on the 14th. As a result, traffic between the south and north of the Suzhou River can be completely restored freely, which will greatly facilitate the Chinese and second-country people living in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Japanese Military Authorities Issue a Communiqué</p>
<p>The content of the communiqué issued by the Japanese military authorities is as follows: The Shanghai Naval Special Landing Force, in view of the current state of security in the garrison area, will abolish the Chinese people's passes and family return permits in the garrison area undertaken by the Marine Corps from 0:00 a.m. on the 15th, but the return permit of the head of the household is still required as before. At the same time, the night-time traffic restrictions for third-country people and Chinese people will be lifted, but if necessary, the bodies and belongings of Chinese people passing through will be checked at any time. The above measures are taken by the Japanese side to understand the inconvenience of Chinese people and third-country people, and within the scope that does not hinder the maintenance of security, to ease the restrictions on residence and traffic. It is hoped that the general Chinese people and third-country people will understand the intention of the Japanese side, respect each other, and not engage in behaviors that disrupt security, so as not to inevitably impose such restrictions again.</p>
<h3>No Confirmation of Opening the New North Gate and Other Iron Gates, No Announcement in Nanshi</h3>
<p>It is rumored that all the iron gates in the French Concession that have not been opened, such as the Small North Gate, the Old North Gate, and the Qin Lala Lianmen, will be opened today (the 15th). After inquiring about the Nanshi Refugee Area, it is said that the news has not been heard. When the iron gates at Shangjue Xieqiao, Nanyangqiao, and other places were opened, the Japanese side posted announcements in Nanshi in advance. Since no announcements have been found this time, the news of the opening may be speculation by those who are oversensitive. The reason why the French Concession has been slow to open the iron gates at the New Old North Gate and other places is also because those entering and leaving Nanshi are not too crowded, and the opened iron gates are enough for residents to enter and leave.</p>
<h3>Southwestern Individual Small Package Mail, Resumed Acceptance, Large Commodity Parcels Will Also Be Resumed Soon</h3>
<p>The small package mail in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces and cities was announced to be suspended by the parcel business section of the Shanghai Postal Administration. Now, due to the resumption of business in various industries, there are many parcels sent to the above three provinces and cities. The bureau has prepared to resume it and now records its announcement as follows: "For the purpose of notification, all genuine individual small package mail sent to various places in Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan provinces can be accepted and mailed as usual. I hope you all know. This announcement." According to the reporter of Xinsheng News Agency, the fees for small package mail sent to the above-mentioned places should be calculated at 100 cm, that is, every 100 cm or its odd number is counted as 6.5 yuan for Yunnan, 10 yuan for Guizhou, and Sichuan is divided into (1) 13 yuan for Dongchuan, and (2) 17.5 yuan for Xichuan. It is reported that these parcels are all loaded onto ships in Shanghai to Haiphong, and are now transported by the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to various provinces and cities, so each delivery takes about two months. However, because of the lack of practical goods in the provinces and cities, they have wired Shanghai factories to purchase large quantities and send them by post. Moreover, the inland transportation is stagnant, and the postal transportation is not without difficulties. The delivery time has been invisibly extended, and because the deliverers are crowded, it will pile up like a mountain within a few days after the recovery. The Shanghai Postal Bureau's Transportation Section is now trying its best to dredge the waterway so as not to block the way and avoid affecting the transportation of goods. It is heard that the acceptance of large commodity parcels sent to the above-mentioned places will also be resumed.</p>

It is hoped that all sectors in China and abroad can automatically donate to the army at 40 Sassoon Mansion.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Consulate May Reopen Within a Month, The International Relations of the Soviet-Finnish War Changed, Norway Will Not Protect Soviet Interests</h3>
<p>The Dalu Bao said that, according to the Japanese Shanghai Daily News yesterday (the 13th), Norway, which was a trusted friend of the Soviet Union six months ago, is now a possible enemy.

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Annual Report of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps (Continued from yesterday)</h3>
<p>For the year 1939</p>
<p>Section 3 (1) Organization</p>
<p>Transportation</p>
<p>The total number of trucks used for transportation is eighteen. Considering the current situation, this number should not be reduced. There are three old "Karrier" brand trucks, which have been in use for at least eighteen years. Their current condition is quite dilapidated, but they are still in use. The original plan to replace two new trucks each year is difficult to implement due to the excessive cost resulting from the current exchange rates. During the mobilization period in August of last year, according to the mobilization plan, sixty-six private vehicles could have been hired, but only twenty-five were actually hired. All the materials stored in the camps at the Race Course were transported by the Shanghai Volunteer Corps' transportation vehicles to save costs. After unloading the materials, these vehicles were returned to the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. The need for transportation vehicles has now increased due to three reasons: (1) truck patrols, (2) the increased number of personnel traveling to and from the firing range, and (3) intensified training for dispersing rioters. The total distance traveled by all trucks averages 8,596 miles per month. The transportation team used to have a practice where each driver was responsible for managing one truck. However, last year, nineteen drivers were reassigned to drive armored vehicles, leading to the cancellation of this practice. Maintaining the vehicles in good condition has become more difficult. As for the fuel tanks and chassis of the armored vehicles, they have all been reinforced. The sixth vehicle has been equipped with "W.T." However, all the attachments on the vehicles have been removed. The armored vehicles have been borrowed by the police and driven frequently on poor roads, resulting in rapid wear and tear, requiring separate repairs and repainting. In 1936, each armored vehicle averaged 8.8 miles per month. This increased to 30 miles per month in 1937 (the year of the emergency). In 1938, it decreased to 24 miles, but last year, the monthly average reached as high as 290 miles. This was due to frequent use in the last few months of the year. For example, the average mileage per vehicle was 799 in September, 818 in October, 931 in November, and 1,072 in December. At least two armored vehicles are always under repair in the Municipal Council's workshop. The drivers of the Russian Detachment often feel that driving these vehicles is arduous. Fortunately, members of the Transportation Team take turns on Monday evenings and every other Saturday and Sunday to relieve them, allowing them to rest.</p>
<p>Report Appendix</p>
<p>Volume 5 of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Commander's Report contains two appendices. Table 1 indicates a comparison of strength over the past two years. According to the table, at the end of 1938, there were a total of 200 officers and 1,807 other ranks in the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. At the end of last year, there were 195 officers and 1,862 other ranks. The organization of the Russian Detachment consists of 12 officers and 311 other ranks. Table 2 shows a breakdown of the nationalities of the members. Excluding the Russian Detachment, there are 577 British members, 253 Russian members (volunteers), 243 Chinese members, 156 American members, 116 Japanese members, 113 Portuguese members, 78 Filipino members, 70 German members, and 128 members of 24 other nationalities.</p>
<p>(2) Conclusion</p>
<p>The various tasks of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps and the achievements of the members at all levels have been described in detail above. There is no doubt that this work has been of great benefit to maintaining the public safety and order of the Settlement. Although the headquarters has tried its best to avoid summoning volunteer members during office hours, the occupations of the members are still inevitably greatly affected, especially those of the Commander, the Executive Officer, and the Adjutant. These officers all hold important occupations, and their work in the Shanghai Volunteer Corps has become more burdensome due to the avoidance of general mobilization. The difficulties of the Volunteer Commander have been considered. This has led to recruitment problems. Commanders of units with a full complement of personnel find it easier to recruit members, but the more vacancies there are, the more difficult it becomes to recruit. This is one of the most important aspects of the recruitment problem. The headquarters is making every effort to recruit physically strong foreigners to join the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. The cooperation of employers is particularly important. Progress has been made in this regard. Some firms have already taken practical measures, but the results are not very satisfactory because firms with employees joining the Shanghai Volunteer Corps only belong to one nationality. These firms are more deeply affected by the international situation. These employees have assumed significant responsibilities for the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, and their efforts are highly appreciated by the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. However, the results cannot be considered satisfactory until all foreign firms, regardless of nationality, send personnel to join the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. The number of young people leaving Shanghai in previous years has been small, but in the future, more young people will leave this port due to the European war. Therefore, physically strong residents, regardless of their qualifications, should be given some military training as a permanent duty. As for the issue of key employees in commercial firms, it can be properly resolved by the officers of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps and the Commander. There are many officers who are key employees, and they are well aware of the difficulties and solutions involved in this issue. The Shanghai Volunteer Corps hopes that the Municipal Council will obtain the full cooperation of all relevant employers in 1940 so that this urgent problem can be resolved. (The end)</p>
<h3>Soochow University Campus Damaged, Japanese Side Has Not Yet Compensated, US-Japan Negotiations Still in Progress, Only Some American Nationals Reside on Campus</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily News, it was learned yesterday (the 13th) that within the Soochow University campus in Yangtzepoo, which is occupied by the Japanese, there are now the families of five missionaries and four single female teachers, all of whom are American nationals. Since moving there, no incidents have been reported. According to the missionaries, they have not been harassed, but there is still no date set for reopening classes on campus. Soochow University is managed by the American Baptist Convention. During the Shanghai War in 1937, some buildings on campus were destroyed by artillery fire. The exterior of the North Building has now been repaired and returned to its original state, while the interior is still being renovated. In addition to American nationals, a small number of Chinese workers and caretakers reside on campus, but there are no Chinese teachers or students. Discussions between the US and Japanese authorities regarding compensation for the damage suffered by the school are still in progress. Currently, Soochow University has temporarily moved to the International Settlement.</p>
<h3>American President Lines, Two Liners Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The American President Lines' President Cleveland, returning from Little Luzon via Hong Kong to Shanghai and then Japan to return to the United States, is scheduled to arrive in port at 5:00 PM today, berthing at buoy 12 and 13. Passengers will transfer to small launches and arrive at the Custom House Wharf at approximately 6:30 PM to disembark. The liner is scheduled to set sail at noon tomorrow (the 15th) for Kobe, Yokohama, and then return to Los Angeles via Honolulu.

Also, the company's President Taft, which sailed from the United States to Little Luzon last month, was originally scheduled to return from Little Luzon and arrive in Shanghai on the 28th of last month. Unexpectedly, the ship's engine suddenly broke down en route to Hong Kong, and it entered the dock for repairs upon arrival. As a result, the arrival date in Shanghai was repeatedly delayed, as reported previously. It is now learned that the ship has been repaired and has set sail, and is expected to arrive in port at 5:30 PM tomorrow (the 15th), also berthing at buoy 12 and 13. Passengers will transfer to small launches to disembark. The liner is scheduled to leave Shanghai at 1:00 PM on the 16th to Japan and then return to Los Angeles.

<h3>Doctor's Fee Dispute, Disagreement Between Brothers Leads to Conflict, Police Accuse Clerk Shen Wentou of Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Zhu Xiaonan and Zhu Hegao, both doctors of traditional Chinese medicine from Nantong, are sons of Zhu Nanshan. They built a residence at 96 Avenue Haig (Nanjing West Road), naming it Nanshan Xiaozhu. Their clinic is located there. On weekdays, the Zhu brothers share all income from both outpatient and house calls equally, with Shen Wentou from Haimen, who is the clerk, being responsible for accounting. A contract was signed, and each agreed to trust and abide by the contract. All medical matters for a certain consulate were also handled by the Zhu brothers. Last year, the consulate presented a gold cigarette case and a gold watch, which were both taken by Zhu Hegao personally. According to Zhu Xiaonan, what was presented by the consulate was the price for daily consultations and should be divided equally. However, Zhu Hegao did not agree, claiming that what was presented was not the price for consultations but rather personal gifts from daily interactions and should not be included in the distribution. Therefore, there has been friction between the brothers. Xu Maotang, a manager at the Chinese Exchange Bank, owed the Zhu brothers 405 yuan for medical fees last year. It was not paid until the end of the lunar year. Zhu Hegao inquired with Shen Wentou, the clerk and accountant, who claimed that the amount had not been collected. Hegao then wrote to Xu to inquire, who replied that it had been paid in full. Suspecting Shen Wentou of embezzlement, Hegao reported it to the New Gate Police Station on New Year's Eve. Detective Yang Feizhang was dispatched to arrest Shen Wentou and send him to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention pending further investigation. However, during the postponement, it was discovered that Xu Maotang's medical fees had indeed been paid, but by Zhu Xiaonan. The police then filed a lawsuit against Zhu Xiaonan and requested that the Special Court issue a summons. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Peishen presided over the Second Criminal Court for a joint hearing. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed a public prosecution based on Article 336 of the Criminal Code for embezzlement, and requested permission for a postponement to investigate further and to be questioned based on Zhu Hegao's complaint. Shen Wentou testified that he had indeed not received Xu Maotang's payment, so naturally it could not be listed in the accounts. Zhu Xiaonan stated that Xu Maotang's payment was sent by someone instructed by Xu. It should have been 555 yuan, but because Mr. Yang of the Chinese Exchange Bank pleaded with his younger brother Hegao by phone, he agreed to pay 405 yuan, so only 405 yuan was sent and received by him. Lawyers Hong Shihao and Deng Jiabing were hired to defend him. Judge Xiao ordered that the case be postponed for seven days for further hearing, and Shen Wentou was released on bail of 100 yuan pending trial.</p>
<h3>Extortion Case, Messenger Found Innocent, Released, Principal Culprit Awaits Judgment</h3>
<p>Cai Axing from Shaoxing, a hardware merchant residing at a certain number on North Shansi Road, received a threatening letter on the afternoon of the 2nd of this month demanding 500 yuan, or he would be reported to the Japanese Command for buying stolen cotton yarn from a Japanese-owned mill in Hongkew. Cai Axing eventually agreed to give 100 yuan. At that time, Han Asi from Shaoxing, accompanied by his wife, Dong, and Han Agou from Shaoxing, who delivered the threatening letter, arrived to collect the money. The case was discovered and they were arrested by Wang Youshan, a Chinese detective from the Shanghai Municipal Police. They were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng continued the trial. Police lawyer Qian Xun stated that the defendant Han Agou had been found to be unaware that the letter he was delivering was a threatening letter and was deceived. The police would not prosecute him and would withdraw the detention. The court approved. The two defendants testified that they had partnered with the plaintiff to buy stolen cotton yarn, and there was a dispute over capital, with each share being 50 yuan. The rest of their testimony was evasive. Lawyer Zhu Hui was hired to defend them. Judge Huang ruled that they should be remanded to custody separately and that a sentencing date would be set.</p>
<h3>Ham Store Sells Opium, Manager Sentenced to Six Months</h3>
<p>Junfeng Ham Store at 383 Honan Road has been established for many years. Recently, Li Shugui, a Chinese detective from the Narcotics Department of the Shanghai Municipal Police, discovered that someone in the store was engaged in selling opium. After investigation, it was found to be true. At 6:15 PM the day before yesterday, he rushed to the store to search and seized six and a half ounces of opium upstairs. He also arrested Zhan Zhiliang, the manager of the store, from Anhui (59 years old, residing at 87 Rue Cardinal Foch). Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu presented the case and prosecuted him based on the Opium Suppression Regulations. After questioning by Judge Sheng Shengxiu, Zhan Zhiliang was sentenced to six months in prison, which could be commuted to a fine of three yuan per day. The seized opium was confiscated.</p>

<h3>Japanese Brothel Stabs British Soldier, Currently Receiving Treatment in Hospital, Details Still Under Investigation</h3>
<p>According to the English-language North China Daily Mail, a British soldier from the West Yorkshire Regiment was attacked and stabbed in the Emperor brothel on Route Mett Herbert between Bubbling Well Road and Avenue Haig at around 11:15 PM last night (the 13th) by a Japanese brothel owner and his Chinese coolie. He was knocked unconscious and then stabbed with a knife. He was taken to the British Military Hospital by police. The brothel is ostensibly a cafe and states that it does not serve military personnel, but the British soldier was allowed to enter last night. At the time, the British soldier was not in uniform. Two of his friends, who were in uniform, entered the hospital at the same time, but both had left before the assault occurred. The police learned of the assault after receiving a report from a Chinese policeman. Two foreign policemen were dispatched to the scene. Details of the incident are not yet known. It is assumed that the Japanese brothel owner called upon his coolie to help assault the British soldier.</p>
<h3>Low Pressure Reaches East of Japan, Local Climate Turns Sunny, Fog Disperses, Temperature Remains Low</h3>

According to records from the Zikawei Observatory, the lowest temperature yesterday was 0.4 degrees Celsius.</p>
<h3>Debt After Fu Yujing's Death, His Three Sons Sued for Repayment, Summons Issued, Request for Postponement and Settlement</h3>
<p>The late Fu Yujing from Ningbo, who resided at 20 Jinyuli, Baille Avenue, was a manager at Tongtaishunji Money Exchange at the intersection of Ningbo Road and Shandong Road in the International Settlement. After the money exchange declared liquidation on April 11, 1935, Fu had misappropriated 15,000 yuan and 882.44 yuan in interest from the current account of Juchengchang Foreign Company on Avenue Edward VII. This amount was never repaid before Fu's death. After Fu Yujing's death last year, his three sons, Fu Fenghua, Fengrong, and Fengqian, requested the Second Special Court to issue a certificate of administration of the estate. After the court published a notice, Zhang Ronghui, the legal representative of the Tongtaishunji Money Exchange liquidation office, hired lawyer Zhou Lianze to file a protest with the Second Special Court against the Fu brothers' request for a certificate of administration of the estate, requesting a speedy resolution through legal action. The application for mediation having failed, they formally sued Fu Fenghua, Fu Fengrong, and Fu Fengqian, requesting a joint judgment ordering them to repay Fu Yujing's debt of 15,000 yuan and interest of 882.44 yuan, with an annual interest rate of 5% from July 15, 1935, until the date of repayment. Upon receiving the complaint, the court convened a hearing yesterday afternoon by Judge Yu Changzi. The defendants Fu Fenghua and Fu Fengrong did not appear, only Fu Fengrong's lawyer appeared on his behalf. According to the plaintiff's lawyer, someone from Fu Fengrong's side had requested a postponement for settlement, and requested public service for the two defendants who did not appear. The lawyer representing Fu Fengrong did not object to the postponement, but stated that the defendant was not aware of the settlement. The court, noting that the defendants were absent, ordered a postponement until the 18th, ordering all defendants to appear in court for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Taking Advantage of Opportunities, Conspiring to Defraud Store Owners, Owner Reports to Police, Three Detectives Dismissed and Investigated</h3>
<p>Lu Guanfu, Wang Enhan, and Jiang Xian, newly appointed detectives of the French Police, who had only been in office for two or three months, colluded with hooligans Zhu Gaoji, Wang Kunde, and Gao Haogen the day before yesterday. Taking advantage of their positions, they pretended that Zhu et al. were informants and went to the oil workshop at 78 Xiaodongmen Street, claiming to be searching for opium, and extorted 5,000 national currency from Wang Yaokun, the owner of the workshop. At that time, Wang Yaokun agreed to give 600 yuan, but Lu et al. refused, insisting on 5,000. As a result, the secret of Lu et al.'s abuse of power was uncovered by the owner's family. They reported the robbery to the French Police. A large number of Chinese and foreign detectives armed themselves and rushed to the scene, arresting Lu, Wang, Jiang, Zhu, Wang, and Gao together and bringing them back to the police station. After interrogation by the police chief, it was learned that Lu et al. had used their positions to intimidate and extort money. The three detectives, Lu, Wang, and Jiang, were immediately dismissed and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Yuan Jiahwang, the lawyer representing the French Concession authorities, presented the case, stating that the defendants were charged with intimidation and extortion, and requested a postponement to investigate before prosecuting. After Judge Zhang Minsheng questioned the defendants, he ordered that they be detained and that the hearing be postponed to the morning of the 26th.</p>

<p>Weng Changling from Ningbo, residing at 12 Lane 12 Songshan Road, French Concession, was over twenty years old and not yet married. He recently had a lover with whom he had been in a long and deep relationship. Unexpectedly, recently the woman suddenly changed her attitude, and they disagreed. Weng, suffering from this blow, believed that he had lost in love and took poison at 8:00 AM yesterday. Not long after, his family discovered it and rushed him to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Shen Erbao, a young woman from Jiading, 28 years old, residing at 127 Avenue Foch, because her husband had been away for a long time and had not sent money home, was under economic pressure and unable to support herself. She suddenly had the idea of death at around 12:00 PM yesterday and took poison to end her life. Later, neighbors discovered it and rushed her to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Foodstuff Saigon Rice Opens at 50 Yuan, Rumors of Foreign Rice Price Limits Slightly Curb Price Increases, Thick and Thin Rice Private Deals Rise Another Two or Three Yuan</h3>
<p>Since the sudden and unprecedented price surge in the rice market began, yesterday morning, most merchants, seeing that the supply from inland areas was still scarce, with only three or four cars of Danyang Baiyuan rice arriving, there was still momentum for further price increases. However, thereafter, large quantities of foreign rice were sold at high prices, and retailers and wholesalers could not sell it all, immediately creating an oversupply situation. People's confidence waned, and there were few new deals, causing the market to show signs of fatigue. However, thick and thin rice was still only traded privately outside the market, with rumors that prices had risen by another two or three yuan. Baiyuan rice was scarce and sold well, with prices rising sharply by about two yuan.</p>
<p>The speculation in foreign rice was initially not deterred by the extension of foreign exchange trading. The buying sentiment in the market was even stronger. In the morning, after the Saigon rice opened, it gradually rose to 50 yuan, two yuan higher than the morning price of 48 yuan the day before, and also one yuan higher than the public price in the afternoon of the previous day. The market momentum was very strong. However, after the market authorities announced a price limit of 50 yuan for foreign rice, the price increase slightly subsided. In the afternoon, the price of fixed orders was already reported to be lower. Dealers and hoarders became less enthusiastic. No. 1 Saigon rice immediately retreated from 50 yuan to 49 yuan, and No. 2 Saigon rice retreated from 49 yuan to 47 yuan 6 jiao. The situation for Fire Grinding, Large Grinding, and Tokyo Tip Mixed Broken rice was similar.</p>
<p>Resale of original packages was active both coming in and going out, but all were small ticket transactions. As for new transactions, another 1,500 tons of No. 2 Siamese rice arrived, initially opening at 55 yuan 4 jiao, but later falling slightly by 1 jiao to 55 yuan 3 jiao. 5-day tons of No. 2 Saigon rice were priced at 55 yuan 6 jiao. 800 tons of Saigon mixed broken rice fell from 44 yuan 5 jiao to 44 yuan 2 jiao.</p>
<p>The Italian ship "Himalaya", coming to Shanghai from Europe, loaded 4 tons of foreign rice when passing through Saigon, estimated to be more than 10,000 bags. Originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today, the ship arrived earlier yesterday morning, and together with the French ship "D'Artagnan", entered the port and docked at the Shuntai Wharf in Dingkou for unloading. Therefore, the total amount of foreign rice arriving in Shanghai yesterday was a massive 80,000 bags. (Year)</p>
<h3>Flour Market Chaos, No. 4 Flour Sells for 13 Yuan, Wheat Opens at 23 Yuan</h3>
<p>The flour market yesterday was exceptionally chaotic. Except for factory prices, which remained stable, resale goods continued to rise, mainly because the supply of spot flour was becoming increasingly scarce. The resale goods on the market were also not many and were being held by hoarders, causing prices to rise more sharply in the market. It was rumored that the Green Artillery Barracks delivery orders were being sold for 15 yuan. Resale flour from old brands also required 13 yuan 7 jiao, which was 2 jiao higher than yesterday. In the afternoon, the Beiyang gang sold several thousand bags of Red Peony No. 4 flour, which had already sold for 13 yuan. At present, the market is becoming increasingly chaotic. The retail prices of various rice and flour shops range from 10 yuan 6 jiao to 12 yuan. It is heard that a small number of shops are selling old brands for 10 yuan 6 jiao per bag, with a limit of one bag per person per day, limited to 100 bags per day, in order to maintain the livelihood of the common people.</p>
<p>Wheat, after opening at 22 yuan the day before yesterday, continued to rise yesterday due to rampant private trading in flour, which boosted the demand for goods. Because various factories need to set foreign wheat at a certain cost, it is not very prosperous, while hoarders are gradually absorbing it. Yesterday, the price of Suzhou wheat opened at 22 yuan to 23 yuan, immediately rising another yuan, with two or three cars being traded. Factory purchases were more relaxed than before. Apart from the goods sent to the factory, there was no formal delivery. It is heard that Japanese factories also took in several thousand bags.</p>
<h3>Oil Market Shocking News, Bean Cake Opens Above 15 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's oil market turned stable due to the floating hoarders leaving. However, the long-neglected cold-pressed bean cake suddenly experienced a shocking price increase, jumping by two or three jiao at a time, opening at a price never seen before. Generally, profiteering merchants thought that the goods with a falling order had an opportunity to make a fortune, so they acted boldly. The atmosphere in the market was no less than that of the stock exchange era. The Four Plate cake, produced by factories with surpluses, rose directly from 10 yuan 5 jiao (the red plate price on the 13th was 10 yuan) to 11 yuan. Delivery for the second half of February was set at 11 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen, and Changzhou cake at 11 yuan 1 jiao 5 fen. However, the total transaction volume was less than 20,000 pieces. The so-called way out is still scarce, and sales to Shantou, Xinghua, Xiamen, etc., are actually nothing more than a manipulation group.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Yellow Soybeans Continue to Rise, Mostly Bought by Hoarders, Tofu Industry Also Raises Prices</h3>
<p>Yellow soybeans rose another one or two yuan. More than 200 bags of Dalian soybeans were quoted at 26 yuan 3 jiao to 27 yuan 5 jiao; 300 bags of Qingdao soybeans were quoted at 29 yuan 5 jiao to 30 yuan; 400 bags of Wuhu soybeans were quoted at 16 yuan 2 jiao 3 jiao; more than 300 bags of Jiangbei soybeans were quoted at 12 yuan 8 jiao; more than 1,000 bags of Dingjia Zhou soybeans rose from 16 yuan 1 jiao to 17 yuan; and 10 bags of Chongming sand yellow soybeans were quoted at 26 yuan. At present, people's hearts are surging, and sellers are extremely scarce. Only those who are making profits are venturing forward. Actual sales account for only one-third, resulting in a situation where buying a dan of soybeans for 30 yuan is still considered cheap. With such a situation, the common people who are trying to survive on this isolated island are afraid that there will be a day when they cannot even afford tofu.</p>
<p>The Tofu Industry Association decided that from the 11th of the month, old tofu will be sold retail for 1 jiao per piece, half a piece for 5 fen, and 1 yuan 4 jiao per board; tender tofu will be sold retail for at least 3 fen and 1 yuan 4 jiao per board; tofu skin will be 1 fen per sheet; triangular oil tofu will be 2 fen per piece; dried tofu will be 3 fen per piece; square oil tofu will be 1 and a half fen per piece; stinky dried tofu will be 3 fen per piece; small square oil tofu will be 2 pieces for 1 fen; tofu clothing will be 1 jiao 2 fen per sheet; and fermented tofu blanks will be 1 yuan 3 jiao per board.</p>
<h3>Finance Hong Kong Electric Tries Its Best to Supply Foreign Exchange</h3>

<h3>Supporting Inmates</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiayin</p>
<p>To those who commit crimes because of the pressure of life, simply imposing punishment is of no help, we have repeatedly stated this.</p>
<p>He is in society, like a fledgling bird. You catch him, scold him, punish him, imprison him, and release him after his sentence is served. In prison, he not only does not receive reasonable education and vocational training, but sometimes he is contaminated by other prisoners' unreasonable thoughts and bad habits. After he comes out, his feathers are still not full. You hope he can fly far and high, how is that possible?</p>
<p>As a result, one minus one is still equal to one, becoming a confused account in the current social problem.</p>
<p>In fact, this account is not confused in itself, it is our confusion. We have not really subtracted him.</p>
<p>Our society not only does not guide him to the right path, but also forces him to take the path of not committing petty crimes.</p>
<p>In our view, this work of supporting prisoners is extremely urgent. And the most suitable agency to bear this important responsibility, in Shanghai, there is no more suitable than the two concession authorities. It would also be reasonable to use a part of the tax revenue of the two concessions to support the unfortunate prisoners and to enable them to take the right path.</p>
<p>Doesn't the Public Concession have an agency to protect children's welfare? The authorities' farsightedness is commendable. If it is possible, we hope that the two concession authorities will come to help inmates solve their personal and family life problems. Although this matter is troublesome and not easy to do well, we think it is worth a try no matter what, and the gain is worth the loss. At present, the authorities may have to pay more expenses, but the future security expenses may be reduced a lot because of this!</p>
<p>Psychology</p>
<h3>Timid Children</h3>
<p>— Abandonment</p>
<p>"Mom! I don't want to go upstairs alone; the lights aren't on!" Every night, in thousands of houses, children cry out like this.</p>
<p>Perhaps you'll say, "What? Are parents supposed to figure out how to deal with children's timidity?"</p>
<p>Below are some suggestions from psychologists. They may not be new, but they are guaranteed to help you. You might as well try them out.</p>
<p>All forms of children's timidity, except for a very few that are natural, are mostly poisonous sprouts in their little hearts. They are both dangerous weaknesses in their personalities and precursors to their mental unsoundness. They must be corrected and treated.</p>
<p>For timid children, avoid stimulation. For example, if they are afraid of the dark, never lock them in a dark room and scare them with ghosts, because this kind of encouragement is ineffective.</p>
<p>The reason children are timid and dare not place themselves in certain situations may actually be simply because they are not prepared to do so. If your child is afraid to play a certain game with other children, you should lead them aside and tell them how to play. They will definitely be happy because they will have a better grasp of it.</p>
<p>For example, if your child is afraid of the wind because they were once blown over by it, you should teach them how to stand firm, show them how to face the wind, and how to lower their head. After this lesson, they will definitely not be afraid of the wind.</p>
<p>There is also a very subtle method, which psychologists call "counter-stimulation." For example, say your child doesn't dare go into the cellar because they are afraid of ghosts lurking in the dark corners. But if your child also loves sweets, and their mother has a basket of the best sweets hidden in the darkest corner of the cellar, then they will sneak down there. The first time, nothing scary happens, and the second time, the fear will be even less, and the so-called ghosts will remain inactive. Before long, the idea of ghosts will naturally disappear completely. Do you understand this meaning?</p>
<p>The biggest problem with children's fears is the feeling of inadequacy, the belief that they cannot be like others. In psychology, this is called the "inferiority complex." This complex is a combination of all kinds of fears, and it can cause children to be perpetually shrouded in the anxiety of "self-pity," listless and without vitality. If you feel that your child has this kind of problem, you should try to help them raise their self-esteem. You should make every effort to praise their successes and acknowledge the problems they have solved. For their shortcomings, you should point out some clues so that they can correct them.</p>
<p>If children are afraid of something, you should explain it to them in detail. Once, a child was afraid of locomotives because they often saw steam suddenly bursting out when they started. But after their mother explained what steam was and used tea stoves as examples, the child went from being afraid of locomotives to loving them.</p>
<p>Children should have the opportunity to play various outdoor or indoor games with their friends. This is children's social life. From this kind of life, they can obtain a result of eliminating all kinds of timidity. Otherwise, timidity will expand over time and will cause children endless trouble.</p>
<p>Science</p>
<h3>The Truth About Blood Transfusions</h3>
<p>— Hong Xingchi</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Xun's article "The Life of Selling Blood," published on January 30th, describes a heartbroken person selling their blood for hospital transfusions. The original intention was to express the tragedy of life he had witnessed. However, from a scientific standpoint, selling blood does not harm humanity. I am afraid that readers may misunderstand the matter of selling blood and develop a bad impression. Therefore, I will not hesitate to add superfluous details and briefly explain the matter of blood transfusions.</p>
<p>From the medical principle of blood transfusions, if a healthy person has 500 cubic centimeters (cc) of blood drawn in a short period of time, there will be no harmful effects. The body's blood-producing organs will immediately begin the replenishment process and restore the original blood volume in a few hours to a day. Normally, blood transfusions do not exceed 500 cc each time. It can be seen that blood transfusions do not actually cause any harm to the person providing the blood.</p>
<p>Some may think that if rich people can pay to buy blood from others, then rich people can buy blood to replenish their bodies. How can there be such a cruel thing in the world? This is a misconception. One must know that blood transfusions cannot prolong the life of a healthy person. They can only provide emergency relief to patients who have lost a lot of blood or are in extreme weakness.</p>
<p>For a person who has lost a lot of blood or is weak, transfusing tens to hundreds of cc of blood from another person is actually of no use in maintaining their body's needs. According to recent medical principles, after a patient receives a small amount of blood, the blood-producing organs in their body, which were already underperforming (mainly the liver, bone marrow, etc.), are stimulated and immediately intensify their work to produce blood. Therefore, the transfused blood only stimulates the body and generates efficacy, and is not used to supply its needs.</p>
<p>The above principles are specialized knowledge, but they are easily misunderstood. It is necessary for everyone to know this. In Europe and the United States, there are many people willing to voluntarily provide blood transfusions and register in hospitals. However, China's science is backward, and even simple common sense is met with blank stares. It is no wonder that people regard blood transfusions as a tragedy.</p>
<h3>Blood Storage Bank</h3>
<p>— Moming</p>
<p>The article "The Life of Selling Blood" by Mr. Lu Xun, which was published in this journal earlier, was quite moving. However, the general public often has misconceptions about blood transfusions. From a personal point of view, blood transfusion can be said to be a heroic act of saving others, and should not be regarded as an ordinary business transaction. Moreover, the loss of a certain amount of blood does not cause any major impact on a healthy person. In terms of medicine, blood transfusion is a reasonable and legal act. The Shanghai Chinese Medical Association even has a formal organization for blood transfusion services. Recently, a type of "blood storage bank" has appeared abroad, which can be said to be the most advanced and perfect blood transfusion method, and I will introduce it here.</p>
<p>The "blood storage bank" is a new invention created by a rural hospital in Chicago. It greatly simplifies the matter of emergency blood transfusions. When a patient needs a blood transfusion, they no longer have to "wait until the last minute" and frantically look for willing or suitable blood donors. Now, fresh blood can be properly stored in a refrigerator and will not spoil for several weeks. Moreover, the "bank" can store all types of blood (human blood is divided into three types and cannot be mixed) to meet the needs of each type without having to be tested again.</p>
<p>If a patient is going to undergo major surgery, they can deposit a pint of their own blood one or two weeks in advance for emergency use. A healthy pregnant woman should store 200-100 cc of blood one or two weeks before the expected date of delivery. If they don't need it themselves at that time, they can transfer it to others. Patients can also borrow blood from the "bank" temporarily and repay it by drawing their own blood after they recover. The blood of people who have recovered from many infectious diseases such as scarlet fever can be used to treat patients with the same disease, and the "blood storage bank" can fully supply this as well.</p>
<p>War</p>
<h3>Wartime Britain</h3>
<p>— Yun Hen</p>
<p>Almost five months have passed since the outbreak of the Second European War. Although there has been no large-scale attack on land except for naval warfare, the people of wartime Britain have already felt the impact of the war.</p>
<p>The income tax, which was previously five shillings and sixpence per pound, has been increased to seven shillings and sixpence this year. Therefore, a married person with three children who earned 350 pounds a year before the war did not have to pay taxes, but now has to pay 5 pounds and 12 shillings in income tax.</p>
<p>Britain had a rich stockpile of food before the war, so it has not yet implemented food rationing like Germany. However, it is said that the supply of butter and bacon will soon be subject to this system to prevent hoarding and speculation.</p>
<p>Residents of London's bustling city areas have been evacuated to the countryside, so shops in the suburbs are booming and making a fortune, while shops in the towns are desolate.</p>
<p>In wartime Britain, a curfew is in effect from 5:45 PM. After sunset, the whole city is silent. Unless there is something special to do, everyone stays home and reads books for recreation. When going out, they carry flashlights, so the prices of flashlights and batteries have risen alarmingly.</p>
<p>Britain is a calm nation, and it is also quiet in wartime, waiting for the demise of Hitlerism.</p>
<h3>New Scenery in Britain</h3>
<p>"They installed these new telephone lines; it's really inconvenient to fly." (After the outbreak of the Second European War, anti-aircraft nets were deployed in the airspace of British cities to prevent enemy aircraft from attacking, which greatly inconvenienced the innocent birds in the sky.)</p>

<h3>Foreign Film Industry Groups Celebrate the 50th Anniversary of Cinema</h3>
<p>— Xin Ying</p>
<p>—Filming of Guests Will Be Shown the Next Day—</p>
<p>Although film has spread to every corner of the world today, strictly speaking, even for the United States, a leading country in film, it has only a short history of 50 years. It was not until 1891 that the first official film was shown in the United States, so this year marks the 50th anniversary of cinema.</p>
<p>In order to celebrate the 50th anniversary of cinema, the foreign community in this city, initiated by the Film Arts Association, will hold a celebration at a dance hall operated by foreigners. All plans are underway. According to the news we have received so far, this celebration will be held next month, but the exact date has not been determined. In the history of cinema in Shanghai, such a celebration will create a new page.</p>
<p>This celebration is being carried out jointly by the Shanghai offices of European and American film companies. According to the planned schedule, during the first two nights of the four days, all the guests in the dance hall will be filmed one by one. This kind of film can be shown in the same place on the last two nights, so the guests can see their own images on the screen.</p>
<p>All the action films taken in the dance hall will be sent to a major film company in Hollywood. All the procedures have already been arranged with the Shanghai office of that film company. At the same time, all the guests who are filmed have the hope of winning a prize. The criteria for selection are to choose who is the most suitable for filming on the screen, and whose face is most like the face of a major Hollywood star. This is indeed a very interesting thing.</p>

<p>The legendary stories of heroes and beauties seem to always suit the taste of Shanghai people. The popularity of the Peking opera "Wen Su Chen" on the stage is almost like a miracle. Its adaptation to the screen, from a commercial point of view, is of course also "inevitable."</p>
<p>The female lead of the Changying film "Wen Su Chen" is also the lead in the Peking opera, the famous actress Wang Xichun. The Peking opera author Zhu Juechu is also the screenwriter of the film, Zhu Shilin. It is naturally easy to please with familiarity, so the "Wen Su Chen" film also won the love of the audience. Now, the second episode of "Wen Su Chen" will also be shown at the New Light.</p>
<p>In the movie, Wen Su Chen is a hero who travels around the world and is admired by women everywhere. In the second episode, there are two beauties who love him. However, Wen Su Chen's personality has been shaped by the playwright into a selfless and extraordinary man, with more elements of generosity and passion and fewer elements of romance. One thing worth mentioning is the discovery of the new star Lin Hongyu in the second episode of "Wen Su Chen." She is very beautiful. Although it is her debut, you can see her talent for performance. The future is immeasurable. Wang Xichun is still touching, and Liu Qiong seems to have more opportunities to act. Because there is an audience, it is said that the United Company is asking Zhu Shilin to plan and film the third episode of "Wen Su Chen."</p>

<h3>Three Lashes and Three Boards (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>Mr. Guan and Mr. Li's duet "Searching the Orphan," Mr. Guan is not satisfied with his own whip-handling skills. This shows that he knows its difficulty and is humble. In the world, it is easy to act on what is difficult to know. Once you know it, there will always be a day when you reach perfection. The key is to study hard and practice diligently. Everyone can encourage each other. Another similar thing is the three boards of "Beating the Nephew at the Grave," which are also difficult to hit and endure. "Beating the Nephew at the Grave" is also known as "Zhuangyuan Score." In the early years of the Republic of China, I learned this play from the old Peking opera actor Mr. Chen Fusheng in Beiping, and then I corrected it with Mr. Chen Yanheng. It is said that when Lao Tan and Wang Guiguan (Zi Lengxian) performed together, Chen Boyu waited for the boards to beat the nephew. One was good at hitting and the other was good at enduring. It was called a masterpiece, as wonderful as the whip-handling in the "Searching the Orphan" duet sung by Tan and Jia, and no one could match it. Whenever Mr. Yanheng talked about this, he would always praise and sigh. Although I know the method and meaning of beating, I lack regular practice. Occasionally, when rehearsing, I would hold a large board and make a gesture, and the one I hit was the director or the air. I regretted that there was no young actor who could endure it like Wang Guiguan, sacrificing his thighs and actually enduring three blows from me to test whether I could beat him. Coincidentally, it sounds ridiculous, but the famous young actor Yu Zhenfei has indeed endured three boards from me on stage. I wonder if any of the readers have seen it? It was ten years ago, and the play was a charity performance. The location was at the Grand Theater. I co-starred in this play with Zhenfei. Before singing, we rehearsed it once or twice. At that time, Zhenfei had not yet gone north and had not studied Luantan opera for long. When we sang on stage, I played Chen Boyu, and he played Chen Daguan. How well I beat him and how well he endured it are all lost to memory now. After Zhenfei went north for several years and studied with Cheng Jixian as his teacher, I think he must have deep research and experience in this Zhuangyuan Score. I wish I could co-star with him again.</p>

<h3>Pinocchio</h3>
<p>— Translated by Yifan</p>
<p>The Island in a Cage</p>
<p>The stage is indeed a place full of stimulation and temptation. With a song, Pinocchio becomes famous. But at the same time, he becomes a slave to the boss Stromboli and can never go home! The only ones who benefit are the two crooks, who get a big bag of gold. The poor little puppet is locked up in a black cage by the vicious boss. He is going to be taken to the ends of the earth with the circus, and he will never be able to go home, sweet home.</p>
<p>At this time, he remembers his loving father, who is waiting for him to come back. He longs for freedom, longs for school, and wants to be a good boy—so he cries. The only one who can comfort and encourage him is the loyal little cricket, his tiny friend, 'conscience'.</p>
<p>Night envelops the earth again, and a star shines through the dark clouds. The star of hope appears again. As the evening star flashes, a golden light appears in front of Pinocchio's cage. They jump up happily, and it turns out to be the Blue Fairy again.</p>
<p>"Why aren't you going to school, Pinocchio?" the fairy asks him. The little puppet tells a lot of lies trying to trick the fairy. Oh my god, his already long nose is now even longer and uglier. The fairy said, "Hey, are you still going to lie?" Pinocchio has to tell the truth and ask the fairy to let him go home. He is determined to be a good boy. The Blue Fairy's magic wand touches the lock on the black cage door, and the lock opens. After releasing the puppet, she disappears. Now Pinocchio is free again. (4)</p>
